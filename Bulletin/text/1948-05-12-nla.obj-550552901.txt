A LTHOUGH Birmingham is generally
regarded as a purely modern city, its
history dates back to the days before the
Norman Conquest and its name appears
in the Domesday Book. The town was
a thriving centre even in medieval times,
but it was not until 1538 that it became
noted for its metal industries. In 1643
Birmingham was sacked and burnt by
Prince Rupert. Since the close of the
18th century the city has made extra-
ordinarily rapid progress. Boulton and
Watt, the pioneers of the Industrial
Revolution, helped to establish its repu-
tation as a manufacturing centre, while
Baskerville, the printer; Priestley, the
discoverer of oxygen; and Murdoch, the
inventor of gas-lighting gave an impetus
to advances in art, science and learning.
Today Birmingham is proud of its repu-
tation of being able to produce anything
from pins to power-presses; its vast
factories represent the highest peak of
industrial achievement.
“Big Brum” —for thus does the city
affectionately name its clock tower,
pictured above —marks the unforgiving
minute for Birmingham. In its shadow
and in the left foreground of the above
picture the Chamberlain Memorial
Fountain gives expression to Birming-
ham’s debt to Joseph Chamberlain, who,
in this city, first conceived and developed
the principles of local administration
which were to revolutionise civic govern-
ment. The statue in the centre of the
picture is that of Joseph Priestley (1733-
1804), who, as mentioned above, was the
discoverer of oxygen.
Birmingham is a city of contrasts—a
city of noble thoroughfares and crowded
narrow streets; of spacious parks and
little gardens ; of ancient churches and
modern theatres. It has something to
please everyone, from the treasures of
the Art Gallery to the Reference Library
which has the most comprehensive
Shakespeare Library in the world. When
the many and varied interests of the city
are exhausted there is stilly the nearby
beauty of the Cotswold scenery in one
of England’s loveliest countrysides.

THE MURRAY VALLEY.
Professor J. Macdonald Holmes, who
occupies the Chair of Geography at
Sydney University, has done in The
Murray Valley (Angus and Robertson)
what lay writers have failed to do —put
between two covers a comprehensive
history of the Murray, the romance of
its settlement, the color and grandeur of
its story, the splendid hope that lies ahead
of wise administration and the continuing
tragedy of divided and indifferent
control of our greatest single national
asse't.
When he describes The Murray Valley
as “A Geographical Reconnaissance of
the Murray Valley and a New Design
for its Regional Organisation” Professor
Holmes allows the scientist ,to overcome
the man; 280 pages of history, geology,
sociology, romance, analysis, praise,
blame, encouragement, faith and charity,
with 42 maps and diagrams, some illustra-
tions, a bibliography and an index is
something more than a “geographical
reconnaissance.”
This struggle between the austere
scientist, anxious that fact should not be
clouded by sentiment, and the man re-
sponding to the glamor of that long and
lazy river flowing through the warm land
makes the book almost as fascinating as
the Murray itself. For example, one
struggles with the sonorous scientist of
this passage;
In the classification of initial landscapes
(see Fig. 25) the natural vegetation
associations on the basis of landscape
physiognomy come first, since these asso-
ciations are largely the result of certain
conjoint factors of climate, soil and topo-
graphy.
And a little further along sings gladly
with the simple poet:
And there is great joy in being in the
hills.
Well, that’s what the Murray does to
a man, be he professor or poet, and
Professor Holmes had to contend with it
all through his book, so that it has as
many changes of scene and tempo, char-
acter and color, as the river itself, yet
preserves, as does the river, its entity
from beginning to end.
Coming to his subject. Holmes is at
once seized with the tragedy of “remote
control” from Sydney, Melbourne, Ade-
laide and Canberra. He defines the valley
as beginning north-east of Omeo, thence
sweeping under Omeo, Bendigo, Birchip,
and generally westward through Ouyen
to Lameroo, thence south to the sea,
westward to Strathalbyn, north to above
Morgan, east-north-east to Pooncarie,
then down to Balranald, along the north
bank of the ’Bidgee to above Wagga,
and southerly to Omeo, which clearly
illustrates the “remote control” and
launches the reader into a thorough and
concise history of Murray discovery and
exploration, marked by the queer geo-
graphical error that
the Macquarie and the Lachlan trend away
from the Murray, and only after a long
northern “detour” do they become the
southward-flowing Darling.
However, the Lachlan is put back in
its right course, the tracing of the
multitude of streams goes forward and
Euston is discovered (1853) complete
with pub. Then come the droving days
ahd the occupation by squatters of vast
and undefined territories, and Holmes
quotes Ranken;
False declarations were made alike by
squatters and selectors. Fraud, perjury,
subornation and bribery were universal.
Any man who refused to do as his neigh-
bors did, or to lend a hand when wanted,
incurred the certainty of pufilic enmity.
Iruth and honor ceased to be considered
lands 8 m dealings connecte d with public
It couldn t have been worse under
Federal (War-time Emergency) Land
Sales Control. This was in N.S.W. and
Victoria. South Australia tried to settle
its Murray lands on socialistic theories.
Lomm unities were set up on a sort of “all
men are equal” basis and promptly went
broke or left or had to be rescued by
the State. Professor Holmes notes, and
expands on the theme later on, that out
or these early experiments came the co-
operatives now successfully functioning
and things like the justly-praised com-
munity pubs at Renmark and Waikerie.
He turns with obvious joy to a history
of Murray navigation, glances with dis-
taste at the early inter-State bickering
(Melbourne thought the steamers would
take all the river trade to Adelaide and
ran railways to the river ports as a
counter) and regrets that the steamers are
dead, though seeing no hope of their
return.
Since the purpose of the book is to
put the case for dividing the Valley into
six regions, each to have a large measure
of authority in its own area and to
appreciate its neighbor and co-operate
with it, the six to be inspired by a com-
mon interest as Murray Valley com-
munities, Professor Holmes very early
in the book gets on to his argument and
thereafter develops it through the various
phases, region by region. Thus by page
75 we learn of areas and populations,
forms of local government, comparisons
of States here and abroad, the New State
movement, town planning and so forth,
the emergence of the Murray Valley De-
velopment League and the N.S.W.
Premier appointing a committee
to furnish.... a report and design for the
subdivision of the State into regional areas
....with a view to facilitating planned
development
though this, and related State and
Federal activity in the matter, are sourly
regarded by people grown weary of
periodic displays of alleged determination
to decentralise. They have never been
more than displays and are usually most
pronounced just before elections. Pro-
fessor Holmes seems to accept them as
the sincere desire of big-city politicians
to “do something” for the country ; it
can only be hoped that his faith is justi-
fied. One vitalising influence to which
he gives full honor is the M.V.D.L., and
those who know the Murray, its Valley
and its possibilities cjm agree with the
professor and hope the M.V.D.L. wifi
expand into the longed-for movement
powerful enough to sweep the Valley at
least part way to its destiny.
Professor Holmes’s regional councils,
however, face a great barrier to full exer-
cise of the powers they should hold.
Five of them will encounter State borders
running through their very hearts, a cir-
cumstance that can well cripple them
and which probably prompted the S.A.
Regional Planning Committee to suggest:
It should later be arranged by some
Federal or inter-State body to examine the
regions where they.come in contact along
State borders, with a view to making such
regions coincide as far as possible, even
to the extent of crossing the present State
borders.
That committee presumed the setting-
up of regions as State organisations—
each State forming its own regions—
whereas Professor Holmes’s six regions
are on both sides of the borders —the
main border, of course, being the river
itself, a fact which the author puts down
“to a series of historical and geographical
accidents” He might have added the
adjective political, but politely refrained.
Having outlined his regions. Professor
Holmes proceeds to outline their pro-
gress. The substantial claims he makes
for them will astonish many of his
readers, for though the Murray is in-
delibly placed in our history, art and
literature, it is still a legend to thousands
of Australians who have yet to learn of
the wealth and variety of its settlements.
But, having startled his readers into an
appreciation of this, he wisely warns
them that something more is necessary
something to give the settlements
greater local powers. The alternative is
the “drift to the cities.” In his own
way Professor Holmes has done some-
thing to stop that “drift,” for no young
man of vision could read The Murray
Valley without being stirred by the
future it offers the newcomer, whether
farmer, artisan, professional or business-
man.
Part Three of the book is a careful
description and analysis of the regional
geography of the area. As the author
notes:
Descriptive geography is a lengthy pro-
cess, so Part Three attempts only the salient
aspects which, aided by the maps, bring
out general patterns.
Yet he is too modest, for Part Three is
no less interesting than other parts, and
he who skips it will find his mental pic-
ture incomplete at the end. How may
a region or set of regions be studied as
these are being studied without knowledge
of the topography, climate and soil for-
mations? And the part contains valu-
able data on rainfalls and high and low
incidences —Fig. 15, which shows river-
miles distances from Albury to all gaug-
ing stations down to Murray Bridge and
average rate of river flow, will settle
arguments that have raged up and down
the river for 50 years.
And in Part Three, inevitably, appears
the universal villain of all Australian non-
urban writing Erosion. Professor
Holmes knows the brute only too well
and finds its grim shadow cast all over
the Valley, from the blowing sand up-
stream from the mouth to the Murray
headwaters where
the hillsides are ruthlessly cleared and it
may be advisable [w advisable] to replant
many of the areas or close them from
utilisation [grazing] to permit self-regenera-
tion of the trees... .There is evidence of
sheet erosion in all grazing hillsides.
This, unless stopped, will ehd in “a loss
of soil and depletion of ney/ forest growth
on the top slopes and uncontrollable
floods lower down.” Part Three is a
book by itself, though much of it is
written in the scientific jargon common
to C.S.I.R. publications and will be
skipped by many readers who frequently
haven’t the time, let alone the practical
knowledge, to translate it into plain
English. Which, is a pity, for this part
contains much which explains certain
agricultural failures on the Murray and
is a warning against future exploitation
of Murray Valley lands.
Flowing steadily to his conclusions, the
author pays close and careful attention
to the problem of obtaining more water
from the Murray system for the growing
settlements, makes a somewhat passion-
ate examination of the disputed Snowy
River diversions, staggers his readers with
a realisation of the enormous losses from
evaporation, seepage and wastage in the
average irrigation scheme and then, as
though surfeited with water, plunges into
the wastes* of mallee scrub flanking the
middle and lower Murray on both sides
and proceeds to as fine a history of
Mallee settlement and failure as this re-
viewer has come across, drawing from
and acknowledging the help of writers
from Mitchell to the latest Government
reports. Heaven knows what we are to
do with the Mallee, other than let it revert
to sparse grazing, and Professor Holmes
is also somewhat baffled by the problem:
In 1928 the Millewa (youngest Mallee
settlement) contained 708 settlers (whom
L. R. East described as the very best
pioneer type hand-picked from a tnousand
applicants) on 600,000 acres. To settle them
had cost £1,000,000 of public money.
Within a dozen years 500 of them, with
their wives and families, were forced to
give up and leave the district—most of
them heavily in debt and with practically
no assets. From 1925 to 1944 the average
annual wheat yield was 5i bushels —less
than two bags —per acre!
Hurriedly making for water again, the
professor considers the market oppor-
tunities for M.V. products, the enormous
sums the Valley has contributed to the
national income, the still mbre it can
contribute, observes that “the people of
an irrigation area can never grow old”
because new developments keep them
young and that “the average intelligence
of people in the regions along the Murray
Valley js higher than similar-sized regions
elsewhere in Australia,” indulges in a
quiet jab at our “go-as-you-please system
in post-school education,” and offers five
possible changes in M.V. administration:
(1) State authorities to give M.V. de-
velopmental schemes high priority in pre-
sent national works.
(2) Increased powers to the present River
Murray Commission.
(3) His own scheme for organising exist-
ing local-government bodies into six
regional but local governments.
(4) A Federal Minister and separate
Ministry solely in charge of M.V. affairs.
(5) “A Sydney weekly newspaper, prob-
ably voicing the opinion of many people,
suggested that the M.V. should become a
new State.”
Somewhere in the last three lies the
answer. The Bulletin, the newspaper
referred to, believes the new-State idea
the most worthy, largely because it no
longer trusts the State capitals or Can-
berra in the matter of rural development.
Whatever form emerges, the people of
the Valley, to whom he has dedicated his
book, will owe a tremendous debt to
Professor Holmes and his publishers.
OLD-TIMER.
Fish and Fishermen.
It would be hard to find a more
pleasant book of verse than Val Vallis's
Songs of the East Coast (Angus and Rob-
ertson). It is mostly about the fishermen
of the Queensland coast, and the clear
and capable poetry is full of sunlight,
storm, salt-water and fish,
Vallis has more than a passing acquaint-
ance with these things. Fish, so to speak,
are in his bones; his verse gleams with
their scales; the sea washes beneath it.
There is, for instance, “The Net-maker”:
This, the authentic and attractive
“atmosphere,” is the first impression his
book makes on the mind. Then, in a
poem called “Winter Morning,” one may
note the rush of good spirits in which he
writes:
Roll up, roll up, the circus is in town,
And frosty tents are pitched in every field.
What artists, lad, you say? Daredevil
Vent de L’Ouest, conjured out of space,
Will leap through the poplar flames and tear
aside
Their glowing tatters; whirl to the beach, and
there
Command the finest ballet of white horses
You 11 see for many a day. What animals,
You ask? The cages of the morning trams
Are filled with creatures, half woman, half
rabbit or fox,
And human leopards swing upon the straps.
Koll up, I say, it is the wildest show on earth,
And staging here for a restricted season.
In the last line of “Winter Morning”
there is a hint of tragedy, the threat of
change and death that sharpens the gusto
of life—for of course it is the whole wild
circus of existence that is staging.here
for a restricted season.” If the verse
is cheerful, it is not lightly so. There is
a war poem—Vallis served with the
A.I.F. in New Guinea —about the troops
leaving for the battlefields:
Time will flood down our bay till all her tides
Are spent, and no moon lives to move the seas.
Caught in her mighty current there will come
A million masts for wool and meat and grain;
° *keir number no ship will restore
The noblest merchandise to leave our shore.
There are several poems on the pathos
of old age, notably “Michael”—about an
old man who treasures shells, pieces of
wreckage, a catfish, stingaree spines and
a sawfish bill, the “baubles” in which he
thinks he has preserved his youth—and
/‘Second Childhood,” with its sinister and
beautiful conclusion:
Age is by my shoulder. One lean hand
Scars the loose flesh of my throat, the other
Turns back the pages of the brain’s webbed
tome;
And, searching there before the written story,
He gloats upon its fingerprinted childhood,
Handling those painted smudges to neglect
The finer scripts I line for his appraisal.
He seems to linger more upon those stains—
Daylong they meet his tireless scrutiny
And midnight candles ripple on their faces.
‘T must tell Brother Death of these,” he says,
Or, better, let him see them for himself.”
In “Fishing Season,” a dialogue be-
tween a “Young Fisherwoman” afraid of
the sea’s threat to her husband and an
“Old Fisherwoman” whose son was
drowned, caught in a net of her own
making, the sense of tragedy gives Vallis
his finest poefn. The young fisherwoman
cries, in macabre and dramatic imagery :
Call back the men who have gone to cast their
nets.
Like a bloodshot eye in the gaping skull of the
wind
The red flag burns on the mast at the harbor
office,
And fti night’s eye the pupil of the moon
Dilates in its iris of cloud-barren space.
How can I still the mounting gale in me?
Death is the only answer that fulfils
Each question-mark the wind-curled waves
imply.
But Vallis, though he has the sense of
tragedy necessary for sensitive writing,
refuses to succumb to the hopelessness
that makes art a mere complaint, the
defeatism that degrades human existence.
The old fisherwoman, who has already
told the story of her son’s death, retorts:
I say the salmon and the mackerel leap
Off-shore. Though finning death may scourge
the shoals,
They flood, a living tide, about our coast...
And this, when sewing-up the hole he’d made,
I held the torn mesh to the lamp that night
And through its tasselled cave a face met mine.
Death grinned at me, like a spider from its web,
Thieving his glances from the flickering lamp.
The flame burned low, depleted by his theft,
And aimlessly my fingers plied the needle.
When, at sunrise, night and tears grown old,
I saw the harbor waking through the mesh,
Death was my prisoner. The net was whole
again;
Its knotted squares of toil had walled him in,
And only promises of spangled scales
Silvered its patterned air.
It is the authentic philosophy of fisher-
men ; and, presenting (without preaching)
the doctrine of acceptance, it shows a
broad and assured balance of mind in
the author. And, ultimately, it is this bal-
ance of mind, tragic awareness mastered
by the love of life, that causes Songs of
the East Coast to make so pleasant an
impression. The core of the book is in
one of the pictures of old fishermen:
As a boy I watched him with his prawning
nets —
His step was surer then, his sight a hawk’s.
The weight of his haul now bends him and his
eyes
Are red with peering over burning waters,
But his wild love of the sea is still so young
Neptune himself might well be envious.
Val Vallis should obviously be writing
novels as well as poetry. With his ability
for transcribing “atmosphere,” his inti-
mate knowledge of fishing and fishermen,
his high spirits, his humanity, his capa-
city for tragedy and drama, his observant
eye and his admirable balance of mind
he has every qualification for a novelist,
and the loose, fluent blank verse in which
his best poems are written gives promise
of an excellent prose style. He has not
yet said all he could and should say about
his fishermen, and he might well find, as
did Masefield and Davies, that prose, if it
means some lowering of the intensity of
verse, gives an opportunity for a broader
and more detailed picture of the life and
the lives that have fascinated him.
No review of F. D. Marshall’s Let’s
Go Fishing (Angus and Robertson) will
appear in The Bulletin. It tells you
everything you want to know about bait,
tackle and tactics for catching everything
from flathead to Murray cod and should
be discussed reverently and at length.
The reviewer, unfortunately, read it—and
went fishing.
His hands were delicately fingering harp-strings
As he leaned above the taut ropes on the fence,
And his ear was low to the float-line, hearing
there
In this strange instrument his time-loved song—
Of southerly busters, and the choppy ebb
Against fresh northerlies, the strong, clear call
Of journeys home, with bellied sails and chests
As silvered as a Spanish galleon’s hold.
All this the net played, his brown hands shuttling
Crab-wise, industriously, across its strings.

Meaning and origin of the phrase
“fourth estate’'’ ?
The conception of the “three
estates of the realm” (now usually
understood as being the lords spiritual,
the lords temporal, and the commons)
as the great divisions of legislative
authority led in England to the coin-
ing of the phrase “fourth estate”
to indicate some power of correspond-
ing magnitude in the State distinct
from them. Fielding thus spoke of
“the mob,” and Hazlitt of Cobbett;
but the phrase is now usually applied
to the press, a usage originating in a
speech by Burke. See Carlyle’s Hero-
worship.

(1) How to deal with shrinkage in
a new jarrah floor causing cracks be-
tween the boards? (2) How to treat
the floor surface to make it attrac-
tive ?
(1) The only satisfactory way to
overcome the difficulty, caused by
laying the floor while the wood was
green, is to take it up and re-lay it.
It is possible to fill the cracks be-
tween the boards with plastic-wood,
available at hardware stores (Selley’s
Wood Filling, Nu-Wood, Necol
Cement), but this would be trouble-
some, and it is possible that during
wet weather the expansion of the
wood might squeeze out some of the
plastic-wood. If you try this method,
fill in the cracks with sufficient plastic-
wood to make the filled-in portion
slightly raised so that when it dries
and shrinks slightly it will settle
down to a flat finish. (2) We have
asked the N.S.W. Forestry Commis-

A few details concerning the Eng-
lish poet Sir William Watson ?
He was born at Burley-in-Wharfe-
dale, Yorkshire, on August 2, 1858,
and died on Aughst 11, 1915. His
first book was The Prince’s Quest
(1880); he gained recognition with
Wordsworth’s Grave (1890) and fine
ode on death of Tennyson, Lacrymx
Musarum (1892); expressed political
convictions with passion in sonnets

Year of Shame (1896). He was the
author of several volumes of con-
templative verse.

Longest fight under (1) London
Prize Ring and (2) Marquis of
Queensberry rules? (3) Shortest box-
ing contest?
(1) Longest bare-knuckle fight took
place at Melbourne in November,
1855, when James Kelly and Jonathan
Smith fought for six hours, 15
minutes. (2) Longest boxing contest
was of 110 rounds (seven hours, 19
minutes) at New Orleans on April 6,
1893, when Andy Bowen and Jack
Burke battled to a draw. (3) It took
place at Montreal in 1928, when A 1
Foreman took 11| seconds (including
count) to knock out Ruby Levine.

When to prune poinsettia shrubs?
How to propagate these cuttings ?
Prune in August. On sandy soils
cut back to about, three or four
“eyes” on the old stems, leaving about
9in. of old wood; in heavy soils the
pruning should be less drastic. Cut-
tings should be dried in the sun for
a week before setting in position. Re-
strict watering in the early stages,
otherwise heavy losses will result.

Brief Answers.
F.M.: The record number of con-
secutive days on which the tempera-
ture at Marble Bar (W.A.) exceeded
100 deg. Fahr. was 161 days from
October 30, 1923, to April 7, 1924.
Similar information for Death Valley,
California (U.S.A.), is not obtainable.
... .G.A.P.: The lucerne-patch which
is losing growth has probably had
too much fowl manure applied in the
past, which is burning the vegetation.
Care should be taken not to apply
too much of this manure in future...
One cwt. of superphosphate per acre
should be applied annually in the
autumn G.L.: Particulars of the

A flight in a plane
In tranquil weather

On a airoplane flight.


THE BIRDS
—-—"ajjHE cart bumped along the
I country road. There was wood
9 in the back of it, spindly wood
I cut from water logged paddocks.
i The seat of the cart was
aj a board with two folded
chaff-bags on it, and Clem and
Flodie sat on it bolt upright, bounc-
ing gently up and down. Clem sat with
the reins slack in his hands, his eyes on
the old roan horse that looked as if
someone had started to clip it, then
stopped in a hurry.
“Tsch, tsch, tsch! Get a move on there,
can’t you?” he cried in a soft, slurred
voice.
He stared at the horse’s head at a
point exactly between the sharp pricking
ears, but his eyes saw nothing but Flodie
sitting there beside him, Flodie big and
plump and magnificent, her clumsy feet
turned in under her like two sawdust dolls.
She wore a bright red cardigan that
dragged across her breasts, and a name-
less wisp of floating purple at her neck.
There was a scarlet feather stuck in the
hat that came well down on to her
shoulders. She had a long, fleshy face
with the skin as finely textured as the
petal of a rose, and her straw-colored
hair fell in ringlets round her neck.
She was past forty now, but she looked
'exactly the same as she had looked six
years before when Clem Artis had mar-
ried her straight from a shoddy little
West Melbourne pub. She had bloomed
in its sour, vitiated atmosphere, and she
bloomed as bravely among the cold,
rushing airs of the farm.
CLEM liked to think of his place as
a farm. A farm it had been in the
beginning, but now it was a farm in name
only. Long before marrying Flodie he
had given up the dairy cows and sold
the pigs to the butcher in Saltmouth. Yet
he still managed in a cunning fashion
to get his living off the land. He grew
vegetables and hawked them round from
door to door. He sold rabbits, eggs and
tired-looking flowers to Saltmouth’s
summer visitors, and in season great,
coarse-skinned mushrooms.
Mostly he chopped and carted wood.
It wasn’t very good wood, for much of
it had lain rotting through the years on
the low, soggy ground at the back of the
farm. . It was without body, cursed with
the pale, unearthly green of lichen, and
flaring into fans of orange fungus, but it
sold easily, for wood w , as scarce and he
had a pleasant back-door manner with
housewives.
The farmhouse was a mean, four-
roomed cottage, the kitchen and the dingy
back bedroom separate from the grander
front part of the house. A shaggy garden
billowed all around it, running away into
brilliant green paddocks that led on to a
road. ■ , ,
The land was low here, broken into
hollows and often under water. In wet
winters the water lay for a long time
between the spindly tea-tree clumps and
thick little islands of melaleuca, with its
white, papery stems, and the black,
shallow waters were touched into a
strange, startling beauty, became black
polished mirrors reflecting patches of sky,
and the fugitive shapes of birds flying
over, the pied magpie-larks and speckled
honeyeaters, and occasionally on wild
days gulls blown in from the sea lurching
drunkenly along the wind.
It was a pleasant-enough place, and, like
Clem himself, changeless. Clem would go
on looking young for a long time because
of the ruddiness in his cheeks, the gentle-
ness of his eyes and a pleasant mouth
that smiled easily, showing two rows of
black, decayed teeth that belonged to him
and were part of him like the greenish
woollen sweater under his coat, and the
dark hair that was beginning to recede
from his forehead.
He was a happy man. He had been
happy womanless, pigging it in the
kitchen, eating anyhow, tending his birds
in the aviary he had built between the
two halves of the house, the painted
finches, the white-headed nuns, the black-
headed nuns, the canaries, the tight little
budgerigars, the green, the yellow, and
one pale blue that was the color of the
summer sky. All his life he had loved
birds. They were a passion. Now he
had two —the birds and Flodie.
HE looked at her as she sat there, the
pale afternoon sun showing up the
laughter-lines round her eyes. They were
leaving the bumpy road now and turning
into the main highway, abandoning the
scratchy gorse-bushes for the backyards
of the town, and the sea that lay beyond
pale as silver.
“You all right, love?” .
He was careful of her ever since that
winter she had gone down with bron-
chitis. He had driven into the hospital
every day, hanging in an agony of fear
over the big, white hillock in the bed that
was Flodie.
He had borrowed on his insurance then
to pay the bills, but he had not. worried.
He took a naive pride in her ailments,
boasting of them as another man would
boast of his wife’s accomplishments.
Flodie’s heart, her chest, her swollen
ctnlclcs
“You all right, love?” he asked again.
“How you going?”
“Grand.” Flodie settled her head down
into her shoulders, winked and looked
about her with delight.
It was always a treat to go into Salt-
mouth. She liked driving to the old
ramshackle market when Clem had any-
thing to sell. She liked calling on Uncle
Gus, Clem’s uncle, who ran a pieshop
in the street; she liked sitting in front of
the piled wood and getting down from
the cart and watching while Clem un-
loaded.
by MYRA MOŔIS
Today they dropped their wood at a
house on the seafront and drove straight
to the market.
Clem did his business, connected with
the selling of a few eggs of doubtful
age, and some wilted vegetables, and
Flodie padded round in a happy dream,
her skirt brushing the dusty second-hand
furniture, the crates of livestock and
bunched tin kettles. She was happy until
she saw the piano standing among the
tables and chairs.
Now she was edging closer to the
piano. She lifted the lid and the keys,
smooth and ■ yellow as old honeycomb,
stared up at her. She struck a note and
the sound vibrated in her ears delicate
and far away like the sound of a plucked
harpstring. Out of the corner of her
eye she watched the approach of Mr.
Isaacs, who conducted the business of
the market.
MR. ISAACS was brown and thin, all
sharp knobs and angles like a stick
insect. He clung to the piano, clutch-
ing one end of it as if he were attaching
himself to a covering tree.
“It’s a fine instrument,” he said softly.
“How much?”
“Thirty pounds,” said Mr. Isaacs., A
piano like that! It would make you
cry.”
Flodie was silent.
“Thirty pounds,” said Mr. Isaacs
thoughtfully. “But special terms could
be arranged. Say, fifteen down and ten
bob off in weekly payments.”
“If I let this go,” said Flodie drag-
gingly. “Do you have many?”
“Oh, they’re out and in, pianos, ’ said
Mr. Isaacs, rubbing his together
with a dry creaking sound, “Here to-
day and gone tomorrow.”
Flodie nodded, caught in an agony of
longing. Clem was pushing towards her,
his blackened teeth showing in a grin.
“Just fancy, Clem,” she said, and her
voice was rich and throaty. “This piano!
Thirty pounds! Fifteen down and the
res t”
“Gripes, it’s a lot of money,” he said
absently and tugged at her arm. “Come
on, Flodie, We got to get to Uncle
Gus’s early.”
IN the pie-shop Uncle Gus weaved his
1 way from behind the smallgoods
counter and kissed her smack on the
mouth. Her sulky look vanished. She
knew that Uncle Gus liked her and she
liked to be liked. Uncle Gus gave her
presents of smoking pasties and black-
puddings coiled round like sleeping cats,
and these she accepted gratefully, know-
ing they were the solid expressions of his
regard.
He was a bald, tubby man with bags
under his pale-blue eyes, and a nicotine-
stained moustache that hung each side
of his mouth in a tattered yellow fringe.
He looked upon Clem and Flodie, as a
pair, with disfavor. His nephew brought
up on a farm was shiftless and lazy —but
Flodie away from him was fine.
A handsome, well-favored woman he
would say, and his hands, podgy white
and shiny like the bladders of lard under
the counter, would descry in the air two

PYRAMID
[Edmund Besley Court Kennedy came to New South Wales in 1840, when.he was about
23 years of age. As second in command, he accompanied Sir Thomas Mitchell m 1845-4 o
on an expedition to open a route to the Indian market. Subsequently, in a dispatch to ban
Grey, Governor Fitzroy pointed out that the primary object of Mitchell’s expedition remained
unaccomplished. Kennedy was placed in command of a party which left Sydney on April 29,
1848, in the barque Tam O’ Shanter. The party was landed at Rockingham Bay, where the
expedition was to explore “the promontory terminating in its northern extremity at Cape York.
Ten, including Kennedy, of the party of 13 lost their lives. Kennedy was speared to death
at Escape River on December 13, 1848, when almost in sight of the end of his journey.]

NORTHERN THIRTEEN.
Earth is a little larger here, swells out of the
waves
And does not crash in foam, except that trees
Sometimes grow blossoms. But it is still seas:
A sea of grass—or trees with shoaling leaves —•
Smothers the ground. No wonder they have
not found
Kennedy and the others, ten of the Thirteen,
Drowned in sight of the shore, in the green
Coastal foliage, or submerged under Sound-
Proofranges: land banked by a wind,
The monsoonal Trades, that are apt to blind
With an aqueous curtain all knowledge of land.
But bringing back Kennedy and his dozen
A hundred years to the day, you see his name
Larger than Fitzroy’s now. Too late to assume
Whether the Governor sent his giant to cozen
Riches and fame. Conjecture is nice,
Would fill for us many pages, but the North
Was at least unknown and sure to call forth
Exploration, without rubies and spice.
You can imagine call of the roll. We
Who read of the Expedition expect
Some show of punctilio; whatever neglect
Death may bring later. In sight of the sea,
The Barque, Tam O’ Shunter, Rockingham Bay,
1848, and the men come ashore.
It is like standing outside a closed door,
Waiting for someone to knock, to light them
a way.
And Kennedy, once it is opened, cannot draw,
back.
l he threshold of a river perilously crossed,
The walls close in, the ranges: the shoreline’s lost.
It is like hacking through waves: the more you
hack,
The more you stir the waters. Men are strained
For a sight of the sky. •The drowning men
look up.
One catches a leaf like a fish in the sky’s gap:
This is the starboard green their world is stained.
And the pained men stare at each other within
A green world; wonderihg at the strange sea,
At their green faces and green hands, as strangely
Light percolates leaves and tinges the skin.
Longer, you can’t drive on through the intense
Green air: and you must abandon the dray;
Perforce, leave eight of your men at Weymouth
Bay,
To establish a depot; and stagger hence
#
With Costigan, Luff, Dunn, Jacky Jacky — black.
Jacky Jacky I Be thankful he isn’t green
Like a frog and as noisy, as frequently seen:
With no fear of tooth or claw, but a spear in
the back...
Then Costigan shoots himself. Wounded, he
drops:
Stops the Expedition at Padding Pan Hill.
Disaster follows disaster. But Kennedy’s will
Is strong, and the injured stays, if he stops,
With Luff and Dunn. Push on with the black,
black
Jacky Jacky. ..be thankful he isn’t green
Like a frog and as noisy, as frequently seen:
With no fear of tooth or claw, but a spear in
the back. ..
Up to Newcastle Bay—We haven’t left Home!
Such nomenclature, the nostalgic wit
Of sailors shirking this sea, not entering it...
A sea of grass and trees with blossom of foam
And flame. “I saw a tree on fire, and rain
Distort its flames. If I saw fish swimming
In this air, would I think, leaves? My brain’s
skimming
Over likenesses. But there’s nothing like pain;
And no mistaking a hunger, be it for food,
Or fulfilment of aim. My Expedition
Dissolving behind me. Perdition
Breaking out in trees, in this sea-bottom mud.
“See those flames already tongueing the glass,
Not suppressed by water, the flame-trees and
the red
Fungi—the foam now tinged with our blood?
Foolish swimmers into seas of trees and grass I
But we pass on, I and Jacky, my shade,
My black companion, my voice, my ghost;
Who out of me tumbles when all seems lost,
Like an echo out of my rock.. .A raid
“Of fantasy now, at Escape River.
A shock to the system that has been feigning
pain.
A stab between shoulders. Fd say it was rain.
Always heavier storms, and a loose sliver,
Where thunder cracked the globe, impales me.
But it’s a spear. I know. I know the end.
I’ll try to write it, dying...ask Jacky to find
Pencil, paper,. .1 write, dying, out of mind;
But trying.. .trying. Death, at last, hails me.”

INNUENDO.
Nothing nice like nightingales, or as neat
As linnets: but, raucous mouthpiece of bush,
The kookaburra gorges mice...and sweet,
Sweet is the cark of crow in the long hush
Of night, when not to be heard. But rash
Flights of foreign geese and snipe fly over,
While native aviaries take cover.
It is the purple perpendicular of night:
Shadows stand upright, crowd the land.
Stars may seem eyes; blackfellows might.
It lets imagination out of hand.
And some slip out of mind; and some can’t
stand
Our cassowary, or the sexual mating
Of scrub turkey-cocks, wattles inflating
And deflating. It is Kennedy’s land;
And the lost Thirteen s who followed and are
lost,
Who carried a name so far and lost. And
Kennedy, unfound by us, found just
Ahead of most, a name. The Expedition cost
Luff, Costigan and Co. their lives:
Years, robbers, bury all with leaves.
3.
AT WEYMOUTH BAY. ,
The crab walked off like a sun;
The gulls rose, counterfeit foam;
Green shoals of leaves like fish
In a sky like a sea swam.
The fisherman dipped an oar,
A lean extended hand;
Trees and waves on the beach,
Pounded each edge of a strand.
Islands and clouds confused
The lookout in the tree.
Of a hut, or a ship careened,
Which could sail here 2 asked he.
A ship would await the tide.
But winds in the grass blow free,
And waves are on the land,
As furious as at sea.
He thought he heard a bell:
But the swell of the land deadened
Sound from the rocking sky;
And the lookout knew he hadn’t.
That was Carron, the company’s botanist;
Tough as weeds —he finds nothing more.
So Taylor, Douglas, Carpenter cannot exist,
Nor Niblet, Wall. Goddard still lives; and
Mitchell, poor
As a sacked purse, his nerves jangling wires —
An image this may have been of a fever’s fires:
The First of the Month, December, ’4B;
Carron sights the Bramble in Weymouth Bay.
Carron, a botanist —funny to state —
Sees the Bramble, and lets it slip away...
Fades like the flames of q fever, her sails
burning
Down to the horizon, as she sails next morning.
Too much for Mitchell this. We bury him
In a creek, the thirteenth day. Sheets he loves,
As he shoves under clean white waters: dim,
Shutting out constant twist of fish-like leaves.
New sinews grip these ulcerous bones of his.
This is the ease he wished for. We hope it is.
4.
AT SHELLBOURNE BAY.
The empty boat, like a lost mouth.
Crying in a forest of waves;
Circling on an eddy from the South;
Mocked by wide headland caves.
Moonlight on the waters, like a sheet,
That white patch wavering; mocking ghost
Of some hoax in a bush-town street
Darkened, but for moon on a post.
The child cries loud; like violins,
The women cry. Their joke's gone wrong.
The light flares up when day begins.
The fisherman’s been gone too long.
Where is he hiding in those waves?
The ghost’s walked off. It is green.
They look in the headland caves,
But the fisherman isn’t jo be seen.
The dinghy in the Bay is heard
Sobbing like a lost mouth, clubbing
In the waves. They frighten off a bird.
It, too, last night took a drubbing.

Nobody has ringbarked the sea.
It is green still out on the Bay.
The blossom grows taller than we.
Nobody’s left to answer. Absent the lot ;
There were three of them here: Luff, Costigan,
Dunn,
At Shellbourne Bay—with Costigan shot,
Luff lurching, ill; and Dunn? Perhaps one
Lone day he went fishing out on the Bay...
He may have joined tribes. God lured him

RESCUE BY THE ARIEL.
Yes llt is death we expected. Kennedy’s dead.
So we go gathering skulls, not men.
Expected them on the beach, our Captain did—
Curious shells come out to whisper. Death I
Nine
Of the lost Thirteen, presume them drowned.
Three at Shellbourne Bay are never found.
Goddard and Canon, we rescue at Weymouth
Six left there dead —two through the Black-
fellow saved:
Canon and Goddard. And, we might say,
Difficult then to distinguish though engraved
The conviction, that giant escaping too,
Kennedy, ghost or name, was with the few,
Safe on the Ariel beating through homeward
seas;
Striving to tell us his story above the wash
Like the rush of rain crashing in jungle trees.
Jacky, his shadow against the lightning flash,
Speaking for Kennedy; indiscernible now
In the blaze of his glory, blinding us now.
Was it, then, Kennedy coming back, black
To our vision, silhouette on the day
Of immortal memory? We brought him back,
The Blackfellow. But who sent him? They
Who followed their lost Leader, they who lost
Lives, and identities almost, they could tell most;
“Jacky was lucky. He dogged his Master,
Like a good shadow. Sometimes before, or
after.
He could go on with Kennedy, travelling faster.
In his Master’s graces, he could bear laughter.
But we, blind fools who followed, swimmers m
troughs,
Who never attempted the apex of the wave,
fame scoffs
“At us now. Our Leader scoops us all.
He treads on us like a pyramid ascending.
Eight of us at the base, not expecting a fall:
Men at the depot, awaiting a happy ending
Obedient to our Leader, and to our lives
Counselling us to be careful; not cowards, or
knaves,
“But men of an expedition, who listen to orders.
O fools, if their escapades take us unawares.
The madmen ■ are in our keeping; we are their
warders:
But theirs are the acts at which the public stares.
They who love most the apex, though it should
fall, .. „
They are tomorrow’s statues, they top us alt.

ADDITIONS
AGAINST WAR,
Under the heading “We Need
Not Fight Russia,” American
military commentator Hanson
W. Baldwin argues staunchly in
“Saturday Evening Post”
against the war that a good
° ~ . 6 .
j , , . or
granted, the only difference
among them being when it will
start *
Baldwin attacks the notion
that such a war “could be won
— N. Y. “Herald Tribune.”
WILL HE BE HAPPY WHEN HE GETS IT?
quickly and easily, primarily by
atomic bombardment.” This
notion he holds to be based on
an inaccurate estimate of the
number of atomic bombs avail-
able, or to be available, to the
United States, and an overopti-
mistic assessment of the ranges
of U.S. planes and missiles.
Comments Baldwin: “Our
stock-pile and production rate
of atomic bombs are, in my
opinion, very limited —so limited
that victory by atomic bombard-
ment could not be assured -at
any time prior to the date when
Russia is likely to get her first
bomb. We do not have now,
and shall not have in that period,
any real guided missiles of
sufficient range to reach Russian
industrial areas from available
bases. Our long-range planes
would face very considerable op-
position from great numbers of
Russian day-fighters. The Rus-
sian night-fighters and anti-air-
craft defence are weak. But so
great is the area of Russia that
certain industrial points deep in
her territory could not be
reached in a few hours of dark-
ness. Bombing with a few
atomic and many conventional
bombs would not alone be likely
to win a war against Russia in
the near future.”
Baldwin subscribes to the
view > which others have ad “
vanned that in such a war Wes-
Europe almost certainly
would be overrun by Russian
ground armies: “Would we use
a t om i c bombs against Western
Europe? Such a war would
probably be long and exhausting,
even though our eventual victory
would be almost certain.”
Attacking another “false
premise,” that the result of such
a war would be “stabilisation,”
“enduring peace,” “prosperity,”
“a world order of law and
security,” Baldwin asserts that
nothing could be further from
the truth: “War provides no
solution, but merely substitutes
one problem—sometimes far
more serious for another.
Another great war now would
produce problems far transcend-
ing even those we face today.
For the world, particularly the
Western world which we are try-
ing to save, already is a morass
of misery and want as the result
of two wars. The peoples are
weary, morally and physically
exhausted. Much of the middle
group—the true liberals and the
mild conservatives with whom
lies the hope of the future —
already has been liquidated by
the pressure of recent events. A
third great war, fought on
Europe’s soil and in Europe’s
skies, would probably eliminate
for years to come the rampart
of the middle way, and the re-
sulting chaos would push the
peoples of Europe to extremism.
If another war should come
Europe, repository of so much
of Western civilisation’s tradi-
tions, might be finished irre-
trievably. Certainly its battered
survivors would turn to the alien
doctrines of the ultra-Right or
the extreme Left. In our own
country, too, another total war
in the near future might destroy
for ever our way of life. Thus
should we have lost that for
which we fought.”
Baldwin concludes his argu-
ment: “You cannot defeat Com-
munism by the sword, for Com-
munism battens on war and
chaos. It sickens and dies
during stable and tranquil peace.
World order by conquest —a
preventive war —is, therefore, no
answer.”
Baldwin’s own recipe lies be-
tween a return to isolationism
and an embarking on preventive
war; what he calls “the middle
road—a balance of power.” In
other words, “practical inter-
nationalism, backed by national
strength.” This, he admits, “has
many of the difficulties but none
of the drama of war. It offers
no certain security and no sure
g0a1.... It implies the same kind
of world that history has always
known, a world of power poli-
tics and power centres, a world
of tensions and conflicts, but a
world, too, of hopes and aspir-
ations, of energies and achieve-
ments. This course requires the
full and complete participation
of the United States in interna-
tional affairs. We must continue
to strive for collective security,
but practically and militarily we
must recognise that national
strength is still the primary de-
terminant of international rela-
tions.”
Insisting that it is high time
the United States “stopped
boggling at the spectre of alli-
ances,” Baldwin adopts as
sound U.S. policy what has be-
come known as the Armstrong
Plan. That plan—details of
which were given here some
months back —was put forward
by Hamilton Fish Armstrong,
editor of “Foreign Affairs,” its
intent being to get around the
Soviet use of the veto in the
U.N.O. Security Council. Arm-
strong suggested that, under
Article 51 of the U.N.O.
Charter,
a group of United Nations members
enter into a brief supplementary
agreement—a sort of protocol, or
“optional clause” open to all —binding
themselves to carry out the Charter
obligation to resist armed attack.
This agreement would come into
operation if two-thirds of the sig-
natories decided that collective action
had become necessary under the
Charter and if the Security Council
failed to act.
That would amount to a sys-
tem of collective alliances, and
Baldwin holds that if such a sys-
tem cannot be organised within
the U.N.O. framework, then it
should be established outside
U.N.O. He believes that “More
than any other one thing, such
a move would tend to stabilise
the front against an expanding
Russia and lessen the possibility
of shooting war.”
It all sounds very nice, as far
as it goes; Baldwin, however,
proceeds: “But we cannot con-
fine ourselves to political moves
or collective measures alone.
Today our own national power
is still the major bulwark against
aggression, the major factor in
the history of tomorrow. We
must use that power unequi-
vocally, but firmly and justly.
We cannot pussyfoot with Com-
munism and still expect to exist
as a free and independent
people,
“This,” he adds, “means antici-
pating the possible moves of
any aggressor. We must, for in-
stance, learn to cope with the
subversive and the underhand
methods of Communism The
Communists, in 1947, were fight-
ing a guerrillawarfare—economi-
cally, politically, psychologically
and (in Greece) militarily—
against legitimate Governments
and against stabilisation. We
must oppose ‘planned chaos.’
Legitimate national revolution
by a majority of the people
against a decadent, or corrupt,
or tyrannical Government is one
thing But rigged Communist
revolution by a minority con-
trolled from Moscow is' a
bastard movement which in no
sense represents the will of the
people, and leads not to free-
dom but to certain enslavement.
We must not allow Turkey,
Greece, Italy, Austria, France,
Germany particularly the
Low Countries or Scandinavia
to be blackjacked into Com-
munism. For if Western Europe
goes Communist there will
surely be war, sooner or later,
and we shall be handicapped in
winning it.”
Baldwin insists that that must,
and that it can, be prevented:
“A simple declaration, now,
that the United States will not
tolerate arranged illegal coups
or sponsored civil wars, but will
support with arms, if necessary,
the legitimate Government so
attacked would probably suffice
to blunt this Communist tech-
nique.”
Having come that far from
his beginning point, “We Need
Not Fight Russia,” Baldwin
proceeds to make the field of
action all-inclusive: “Nor can
the Middle East, or China, or
any other part of the world be
allowed to degenerate into chaos.
To Western civilisation and to
the United States, Western
Europe is the most important
area, but we must shoulder our
responsibilities in the Middle
East as well as in Europe find
Asia, even though those responsi-
bilities are heavy and onerous.”
What seems to await demon-
stration is whether Baldwin’s
“simple declaration” would
have any better effect than simi-
lar “warnings” which have sig-
nally failed to stop aggressors
or prevent wars in the past. And
if it did not, what then? If “we
must not allow Turkey, Greece,
Italy,” etc., etc, etc., “to be
blackjacked into Communism,”
what happens if Communism
tries that blackjacking? Does
that add up to anything else but
war? And would the same
writer argue that such a war
would “provide no solution”? If
he would, then why fight it?
Why not just let Communism
take over?
Back from Blunderland.
The current retreat from
Moscow makes a remarkable
spectacle of former Leftists
beating their breasts and crying
out in the anguish of their
pierced souls.
Typical of these wanderers in
blunderland, Britain’s Attorney-
General Sir Hartley Shawcross
would seem to have Nuremberg
a bit on his conscience, too.
“Believe me,” he told a re-
cent audience, “three years ago,
two years ago, I was violently
pro-Russian—on the extreme
Left of my party. I still feel
that it is of the utmost import-
ance to secure co-operation with
Russia involving a mutual re-
spect for each other’s rights, but
in these last years I have seen
what has been going on. Step
by step I have been forced more
and more to the conclusion that
the aims of Communism in
Europe are sinister and deadly
aims.
“I prosecuted the Nazis in
Nuremberg,” Sir Hartley con-
tinued his confession. “With
my Russian colleagues I con-
demned Nazi aggression and
Nazi terror. I feel shame and
humiliation now to see under a
different name the same aims
pursued, the same technique fol-
lowed without check.”
No doubt it is just part of
these enlightened times that the
men who make such staggering
blunders continue unshaken in
office—partly, it is true, on the
strength of their now resounding
confessions.
“Political Philosophy.”
What to Mr. Chifley is a
“political philosophy” as summed
up by a U.S. Congress Foreign
Affairs Committee looking into
“the strategy and tactics of
world Communism”:
(1) The Communists have one
goal—world revolution.
(2) They assume the revolu-
tion will be violent.
(3) They are incapable of
accepting the idea that peace
can endure from now on, and
they expect one more catastro-
phic war.
(4) The Soviet Union is re-
garded as the main force of the
revolution.
(5) They fear a coalition
against the Soviet Union.
(6) They therefore fear re-
construction or federation in the
non-Communist world.
(7) They utilise the most
modern and effective means of
cold warfare to strengthen their
own forces and to weaken all
others.
(8) The Communist parties
outside the Soviet Union are
junior partners or auxiliaries.
(9) The tactics are based upon
a definite theory, and the central
propositions of that theory do
not change.
(10) The division of Europe
and Asia between the victors ol
World War II is to be settled

not after, they have entrenched
themselves in trade-unions and
Government agencies. It can
be taken for granted that Com-
munists, who, regardless of
nationality, are members of one
subversive international organi-
sation, will abuse any power
they may get in their hands.
The obvious remedy is to pre-
vent them from getting power,
to expose alertly, accurately and
constantly their network of
front organisations, to put the
full spotlight of public dis-
approval on individuals who join
these organisations and to stop,
before further damage is done,
infiltration of Communists and
Soviet sympathisers into Gov-
ernment agencies.”
As for the quarter from which
Communist fifth-columnists take
their orders, the forthright N. Y.
“Herald Tribune” writer “Hep-
tisax” comments that “those who
have illusions about the kind
of relations the Kremlin wants
with the rest of the world are
not just simple ; they are dan-
gerously simple.” Up to the
grab in Czechoslovakia there
might have been some excuse
for at least hoping that “the ex-
ercise of sufficient ‘patient con-
ciliation’ might soothe and
cajole the cruellest dictatorship
on earth into sincerely friendly
co-operation,” but now “all but
the dangerously simple know,
as everyone who has ever run
foul of the Reds has known all
along, that such hopes were fatu-
ous from the start, and that the
assertion and cultivation of them
has sentenced many million
human beings to that life under
the knout which, to most of us,
wouldn’t be worth living.”
Holding that “the non-
Communist world is now face
to face with calculated hostility
and madness in unknown pro-
portions,” the writer suggests a
variety of ways in which pre-
cautions might be taken: (1)
We should have military train-
ing of youth, because we ought
to have the product of it for
police purposes, whether it is
of any military value or not;
(2) We should have a sixth-
column, a volunteer civilian
force of all ages, like a volun-
teer fire department in each
community, with a few charges
of buckshot always handy, to
respond in an orderly way to
fifth-column sabotage; (3) We
should have, within the over-
whelmingly great body of loyal
union labor, organised flying
columns to take over any plant,
any railroad, any ship, or any
other kind of enterprise, when
it is evident that a stoppage is
in fine with Muscovite policy ;
(4) We should work out some
kind of formula according to
which our own Communists can
be dealt with now, in advance
of trouble, as agents of a foreign
Government hostile to our in-
stitutions and active in the sub-
version of them.
Congress', in fact, has been
trying to work out a formula for
dealing with Corns, as suggested.
It has had a whole swag of pro-
posed legislation before it, and,
while this is “aimed primarily at
the Communist party,” as a
N. Y. “Times” Washington
correspondent reports, “recent
legislative discussion has tended
to broaden the score of attack
to cover the ‘fringe’ activities
also.”
Principal proposals before
Congress have been: (1) To
outlaw the Communist party;
(2) to tighten existing laws re-
stricting subversive aliens; (3)
to tighten the Espionage Act;
(4) to require political propa-
ganda agencies, including Com-
munist-dominated organisations,
to register their membership and
other pertinent data with the
Attorney-General,
Two House of Representatives
committees have been consider-
ing bills to outlaw the Com-
munist party in the United
States and to exclude its candi-
dates from the ballot in all
Federal, State and local elections.
Because outlawing legislation
is held likely to run into Consti-
tution trouble, a law compelling
all Communist and Communist-
front organisations to register
pertinent information with the
Attorney - General has been
strongly advanced in some
quarters as a more effective mea-
sure which would have a better
chance in the courts. A Bill
introduced by Representative
Mundt goes even further, re-
quiring registration as an “agent
of a foreign principal” by any
person who is “a member of the
Communist party, or of any or-
ganisation, association, or other
combination of individuals which
is dominated, directed or con-
trolled by the Communist
party.” This legislation would
also require Communists to
identify themselves in all their
literature as agents of a foreign
Power. Such legislation, its
supporters contend, would have
—Milwaukee ( U.S.A .) "Journal.”
"WELL, HERE WE ARE, BACK AT THE BEGINNING!”
the merit of “exposing” Com-
munists, rather than covering up
their activities!.
The N. Y. “Times” corre-
spondent reports that there are
also anti-Communist bills to bar
Communist literature from the
mails, to prohibit the teaching of
Communist doctrines in public
and private schools, to deny
veterans’ [ex-servicemen’s] bene-
fits to Communists and Com-
munist sympathisers and to
apply other special penalties to
subversive groups.
They seem to have seen
through the “political philo-
sophy” over there, as they have
done in Britain as well, though
the British Government’s' action
against Corns is kid-glove stuff
compared with the official U.S.
action. The U.S. Government,
after loyalty investigations, dis-
misses all suspects from Gov-
ernment service, whether or not
their jobs involve security
matters.
Britain’s Labor Government,
having at least enough nous,
plus guts, to recognise that both
Corns and fellow-travellers are
not to be trusted with vital in-
formation, is ousting them from
all Government jobs that “in-
volve the security of the State.”
, “T h i s,” comments “U.S.
News-World Report,” “is the
first time the British Govern-
ment has seen fit to impose
loyalty tests on public employees
in nearly 300 years. It is a de-
parture from the British tradi-
tion that any Englishman may
advocate any opinions he likes
without fear of reprisal. Prime
Minister Attlee explains that the
step is being taken because ex-
perience shows that Communists
and Communist sympathisers! all
too often place party loyalty,
and loyalty to another Power,
above loyalty to their own
country.”
The Ministry of Supply is the
major British Government
agency to be combed for Com-
munists. In charge of munitions,
aircraft supply, atomic energy,
metals and engineering, it em-
ploys 38,000 persons directly and
supervises thousands more em-
ployed in ordnance plants'.
Other agencies to be screened in-
clude the Foreign Office, with
8500 employees ; the War Office,
with 38,000 ; the Air Ministry,
with 25,000 ; and the Admiralty,
with 33,000. However, the num-
ber of Corns in security jobs in
any of these is reckoned very
smalt
Atom Scruples.
U.S, Defence Secretary For-
restal was cabled as stating that
Russia now has the atom bomb,
but “lacks the means' of manu-
facturing it.” But even if it is
making them, there are still de-
terrents against the things being
thrown about for a while yet,
Moscow knowing well that the
U.S. has them bigger and more,
and the U.S. being restrained by
other quite as effective consid-
erations.
“If the present situation with
atomic weapons were reversed,”
William Henry Chamberlin has
commented in .“Wall - street
Journal,” “we should very prob-
9
ably be faced with a series of
ultimative demands to accept
Soviet solutions on such disputed
issues as Germany, Greece, the
Straits, Japan and Korea, with
an ‘or else’ tacked on. But a
democracy with a tradition of
Christian ideals cannot use the
kind of atomic blackmail that
would be second nature to an
amoral totalitarian dictatorship.
“American public opinion
looks on the atomic bomb with a
mixture of awe and horror, as
the kind of weapon that would
be used, and with great reluct-
ance, only in an . unavoidable
struggle for national existence.
The men in the Kremlin know
this. Had they really feared that
America would throw the atomic
bomb into the scales of diplo-
macy they would have been a
good deal more yielding and
conciliatory.”
Soviet Slave Camps.
More than once the issue of
its concentration camps, into
which millions of actual slaves
are herded, has been put
squarely to the Kremlin, but
even it has never had the face
to deny their existence.
The nearest any Soviet repre-
sentative has dared go to a
denial was Vyshinsky’s state-
ment in U.N.O. that the esti-
mate of 20,000,000 persons held
|n concentration camps in
Russia “must have been made
by a bandit.” He did not deny
there were such camps, nor did
he give any figure for the num-
ber of slaves.
The fact is that the existence
of the camps is too well known
even for a Soviet denial. In-
deed there is practically no
attempt to hide them ; they are
just part of the “system.” They
exist even in such advanced
posts as the Soviet zone in Ger-
many ; a fact officially noted and
charged against Russia in the
recent U.S. reply to the Soviet
protest againt U.S., Britain and
France co-operating in their
German zones. The U.S. Note
described conditions in the
Russian zone: “Basic human
rights are being denied the
population, while concentration
camps are being used anew for
individuals unwilling to accept
this new totalitarianism.”
There could not be a blunter
diplomatic Note than that, but
the Kremlin hadn’t the gall to
deny the charge. Apart from
those particular camps, recent
estimates quoted by N. Y.
“Times” manager Edwin L.
James put the total number in
concentration and other slave
camps in Russia at 18,000,000.
Of these, “some 12,000,000 are
supposed to be Russians im-
pounded for their political be-
liefs, while 6,000,000 are esti-
mated to be war prisoners, com-
mon criminals and other classes
of people,”
James points out the interest-
ing fact that “the figure of
12,000,000 Russians in duress
for political reasons is just
twice the membership of the
Communist party in Russia,
which tells the world its Gov-
ernment is of, for and by the
people.”
James also makes the point
that the concentration-camp
slaves represent an important
economic factor: “In Russia the
Soviets have a labor force of
some 18,000,000 persons who
work where they are told and
how they are told and for little
cost. Many of the public-works
programmes of Russia are being
carried forward by this labor.
The goldmine development in
Siberia rests on this cheap labor.
In a world where international
economics interlace this is a
matter of no little importance.
For 20 years the political con-
centration camps have not only
been a major part of the Soviet
political machinery, through the
work of the secret police, but
for the same two decades they
have produced enormous wealth
at very small cost to the State.”
Dragnet Digest.
Effects of White House Change. —
in the view of “U.S. News-World
Report” the odds are strong that war
will be avoided before the Presidential
election. Expecting that there will
then be a new President, it looks
into the crystal-ball and comes up
with the finding that “a change at
the White House will result in re-
appraisal of U.S.-Russian policy, re-
gardless of what the change is. A
new President will have a natural
curiosity about Stalin, will want to
talk with him.” It should be noted
that the publication still clings to
the notion that something could re-
suit from such a meeting. It did not
like Mr. Truman’s turning-down of
Russian feelers for a meeting early
this year. However, there would be
just about unanimous American oppo-
sition to a President going abroad
to meet Stalin. They’ve had the going-
abroad business.

Corns Discredited. —N. Y. “Post”
labor correspondent Victor Riesel sees
U.S. Corns as realising that their
“party apparatus” is now discredited
“even among the excitement-seeking
culture-crazy dilettantes.” Riesel re-
ports: “Few people have been com-
ing to their ‘front’ meetings. Sub-
scriptions to their newsletters have
been heavily cancelled. They haven’t
raised a nickel in Hollywood for
months. Their national commissars
have learned that the F. 8.1. has the
most detailed records of their mem-
bership and activities right down to
recording and even motion-pictures
of their meetings.”

Britain’s Dangerous Theorists.— The
view that Britain’s present trouble
can be largely debited to mixing
Socialistic experiments into the re-
covery programme isn’t confined to
America, where it is very widely held.
The following strong statement of that
view is from the Belgian industrial
and financial daily “Echo de la
Bourse”: “To attribute Britain’s diffi-
culties to her policy of austerity would
be unjust and oversimple. Their origin
is the war and the enormous sacrifices
the British people imposed on them-
selves in order to attain victory and
save the liberty of the human race.
It is nonetheless true that if Britain
does not recover her economic equi-
librium it is because she seeks it in
the wrong direction, because her
economy is guided by dangerous
theorists, dangerous through their
ignorance of the dynamism of private
initiative, through their contempt for
the capacities and resiliency of men
and through their cult of statistics.
Nowadays in all quarters whenever
there is talk of Britain, the word
bankruptcy crops up.”
* * * *
Canada’s E.R.P. Share. The re-
markable Canadian performance in
supplying Britain during the war is
to be matched by Canada’s part in
the European Recovery Programme
(Marshall Plan). In this, a survey
published in America shows Canada
as due to supply an eighth of the
trucks (costing $78,000,000; the rest,
of course, U.S.); a third of the
413.000 tons of crude and semi-
finished steel; the total 1,600,000 tons
of non ore; some two-thirds of the
1.222.700.000 broad-feet of timber; at
least 50 per cent, of the $78,000,000-
worth of eggs; and “meat totalling
2,680,000,0001 b. will be bought largely
in Canada and Latin America.”

Kara Avis. —Concluding that “prob-
ably the odds are against Senator
Robert A. Taft becoming the Repub-
lican Presidential nominee,” a “Wall-
street Journal” writer gives as a
reason Taft’s “unparalleled political
courage”: “Undeniably, the four
most powerful groups of voters in the
country—and the four most influential
lobbies in Washington are those
representing labor, the farmers, the
Negroes and the veterans. To these
four all Presidential aspirants, except
Taft, truckle and cater, often in a
humiliating way. Mr. Taft is friendly
to all four but not subservient;
anxious to treat them justly, but com-
pletely independent, the one man men-
tioned for the Presidency who has
had the fortitude to oppose all four
when he thought they were wrong
Here is a man seeking the Presidency
who, because he does not agree with
them, has taken issue with all four
of the great organised voter groups.
No other Presidential aspirant in
either party has taken issue with any-
one of them on anything. Some have
been hypocritically silent; others have
gone far out of their way in the
effort to placate; still others have
tried to be on both sides. Not one —
except Mr. Taft —has taken a forth-
right position against anything these
groups favor, or favors anything these
groups oppose.” He’d be a rare
bird anywhere politicians roost.

SOCIALISM FOUNDERS.
That impenitent bungler in the British
Socialist Ministry Mr. “Manny” Shinwell
evidently felt obliged to explain to an
Edinburgh audience of 10,000 miners why
he had to be removed from the Ministry
of Fuel (controlling coal production) to
the War Office. Of course there was no
blame on himself. Coal had been “nation-
alised” as “Socialism demanded”: the
nationalisers just went ahead, like the
Gadarene swine over the precipice, with
the result that production “targets” moved
out of sight, recruitment for the mines
fell away (except for Poles and other
fortuitous European refugees), absentee-
ism rose, export trade hopes (says Cripps)
were “not realised,” and as one Con-
servative critic wrote a few months ago:
The gloomiest prophet, even had he pos-
sessed the tongue of Jeremiah, might not
at this time last year have been able to
convince the multitudes of the magnitude
of the disaster which was to overtake them,
....Today Jeremiah could hardly go
wrong.
How come? Well, said Mr, Shinwell
in effect, the Government just did not
know what it was doing:
When the Government nationalised coal-
mining it thought it knew all about it,
whereas in fact it did not. There had been
too little preparation of nationalisation
schemes... .We found we had to complete
legislation without blueprints.
But they have learned something, and in
the place where it hurts, for “the Govern-
ment cannot seek support of the electors
unless it can show nationalisation is suc-
cessful.” Consequently “the Government
must take extreme care that difficulties”
(the prime excuse with Mr. Chifley, too,
in Australia) “do not make it impossible
to continue with nationalisation.”
And what if Socialism still “demands”?
Mr. Morrison, a much senior Minister
to Mr. Shinwell, even if Manny is chair-
man of the “Labor” party, declared last
month that
The Government cannot automatically
carry out the orders of Labor-party con-
ferences, because if it did the electors would
throw out Labor at the next elections.
That Socialism has foundered in
Britain was revealed by the mood of elec-
tors at the local-government polls in
urban and rural district councils last
month, which repeated the sweeping de-
feat of “Labor” in the county and
borough elections of the previous Novem-
ber ; also by the revolt with the political
party at Westminster. Mr. Shinwell’s own
withers are unwrung; in reply to the
Socialist anger aroused by his admissions
in Edinburgh he said the Government
would “deal with defects and push ahead
with nationalisation in other directions
lt would not be satisfied until it had
nationalised all Britain’s major indus-
tries.” His equally extreme colleague, Mr.
Aneurin Bevan, in the midst of national-
ising the medical profession, joined Mr.
Attlee last November in declaring steel
to be marked down for early attention.
The reason for this always stupid and
now disastrous nonsense, as explained by
Ministers, is that these major industries
“contain too much power to be left in
private hands.” That is precisely Mr.
Chifley’s motive in Australia, as quoted
by him in excuse for the Bank Grab Act.
Socialism for its own sake is the order;
in the Shinwell phrase, obedience to what
“Socialism demands.” It is to go on, in
Australia as in Britain, even if it wrecks
the country beyond redemption. That is
the prospect unless the electors can in-
tervene.
There is this much to be said for the
Attlee Government’s Socialist experi-
ment : “Labor” in Britain went to the last
elections with nationalisation as its pro-
gramme. The Chifley Government did
not —nothing in the Chifley election pro-
gramme even remotely hinted at its in-
tentions.
Hence the Chifley Socialists’ im-
minent referendum appeal will represent
the electors’ opportunity for pronouncing
on the Government’s whole policy. The
argument for permanent central prices
control is a stalking-horse for the regi-
mentation of all industry under a central
bureaucracy, and the advocacy of ex-
tended prices-control itself defies con-
fessions of Socialist failure in Britain
even more emphatic than those of Mr.
Shinwell on socialisation of industry. The
Attlee Government’s White Paper of a
few months ago admitted in the plainest
words what experienced Australian econo-
mists have long been telling Canberra:
The [British] Government now sees that
its economic controls are not proof against
strong, persistent inflationary pressure. Too
much faith is still reposed in price-control.
The Socialists in Britain have, by the
means thus condemned, brought the
British people to a pass at which, says
Lord Beveridge, the social-security
planner, “the whole .standard of life in
this country is in jeopardy.” That afflic-
tion could be borne more patiently if
there were any visible benefit in the
policy of “equalising misery and organis-
ing scarcity,” which has added intoler-
able strain to the exhaustion of war.
Apart from her standard of living,
Britain’s prestige abroad has been lowered
as never before, her authority erased in
Asia and the Near East, her Navy
perilously reduced in fighting strength
and her finances sorely embarrassed.
Steel manufacture, with vigorous ship-
building and motor industries dependent
on it, is Britain’is chief hope in the struggle
to resuscitate her domestic economy.
Steel production in the first quarter of
this year was a record. Yet it is with a
view to nationalising that industry also,
indubitably adding it to the list of de-
struction, that the Attlee Government is
challenging the House of. Lords’ right to
reject any legislation. So obviously
would a fight on such an issue tear to
shreds what national unity remains that
the Lords lately offered a liberal com-
promise in surrender of their legislative
functions in order to prevent it. It has
been refused.
The Socialists in Britain, as in Aus-
tralia, are in a hurry, but they are losing
cohesion under pressure of internal
strains. ‘Already a few “Right-wingers”
in British “Labor,” led by Alfred Ed-
wards, M.P. for Middlesborough, are out-
spoken against nationalisation of steel in-
dustries. While they are on the carpet a
rebel section of some 40-odd Socialist ex-
tremists —“the Nenni-goats” Mr. Attlee
has called them —is bucking against repri-
mands for its support of the pro-Com-
munist Socialists of Italy, against the
purging of the civil service of Com-
munists, and against “the right to express
fearlessly in Parliament” views unavailing
in Caucus.
The stage has come in Britain, and it
will assuredly follow here, when the
“Labor”-supporting mob protests that
Socialism shall not entail any inhibitions
against themselves, whatever it enforces
against their opponents. What Mr. Shin-
well’s “socialism in the dark” did not
count upon was expressed by Mr. Mor-
rison last year, and the insurgents have
been trying to put the skids under him
ever since. There must, explained Mr.
Morrison, be “the best distribution of
manpower” for efficient direction of pro-
duction under the programme of full em-
ployment as organised by the new
bureaucracy:
This is not a matter of exhorting people
to go into the coalpits or the mills. It
involves the re-deployment of the labor
force so that everybody is employed to
the best advantage, and so that by a neces-
sarily-complicated process [!] what may
seem to be irrelevant manpower savings
in one part of the country or in one
branch of the economy may ultimately
secure the desired results.
Was ever conscription of industry more
euphemistically phrased?
This situation in Britain is worth all
Australians’ study. Seventeen days hence
they will be asked to vote “yes” or “no”
to an even more blind, fumbling Govern-
ment in Canberra, blundering into pre-
cisely the Attlee Government’s bog.
A “yes” vote will as certainly lead in
Australia, as the use of controls has led
in Britain, to the forced direction of all
employees, “to the best advantage” in
the opinion of some collection of bureau-
crats. Socialisation cannot “ultimately”
proceed without it.
"God Bless Him"!
Federal “Labor” professes to see the
brand of the coming man on Mr. Beazley,
the member for Fremantle. Certainly
the young man stands out from most of
his colleagues inasmuch as he has an
agreeable voice, an ample vocabulary
and no mean skill in the construction of
sentences. But he is too apt to believe
what he wants to believe, and his excess
of zeal for the “Government” betrays
him into talking rubbish.
In the censure-motion debate, pleading
for “tolerance of Communists,” Mr.
Beazley blithered that the “Government”
could “fairly claim” that its “policy of
tolerance is not one which has led to
any dangerous upsurgence of Commun-
ism in Australia.” The fool of the
family could not have put up a sorrier
defence of the “Government” or timed
it worse.
For the Beazley nonserise was uttered
when those particular pets of the “Gov-
ernment” the Communist-led seamen and
wharflaborers, confessing defeat in the
Communist blockade of Queensland, of
which the “Government” was an idle and
scared spectator, were returning to work
after having done Queensland, Australia
and Britain all the harm they could do.
It was uttered when the Com-
munist mob-leaders Runaway Rowe
(A.E.U.), Healy (Waterside Workers’
Federation) and Healy, alias McCracken
(Brisbane Labor Council) were getting
what had been coming to them under
Queensland law, and when another Com-
munist mob, in Sydney this time —un-
vexed by the McGirr police, as the N.S.W.
railwaymen who joined in the Communist
blockade of Queensland were unvexed
by the McGirr “Government” —were
gathering to hurl insults at Mr. Hanlon.
In another choice bit about the “Gov-
ernment” the too-enthusiastic young man
extolled it for “the decline of the Com-
munist vote.” A decline there has been,
but it is attributable in the main to the
clumsy crimes and follies of Communists
and their Moscow masters. For such
of it as is due to political action the
praise should, of course, go to fighters,
not quitters; to fighters like Mr.
Hanlon, Mr. Duggan and Mr, Walsh
(till Communists raised the sectarian cry
against him, as is their poisonous prac-
tice) and Mr. Hollway and Mr. Mc-
Donald. But the member for Fremantle
gave all the credit to quitters.
The young gentleman had no compli-
ments for Canada, “the only member of
the British Empire which has banned the
Communist party”:
I remind the House that the Government
of Canada is a Liberal Government, and
that the core of its strength is in Quebec,
where the French-Canadian tradition is
entirely foreign to the British idea.
More Beazley nonsense. Laurier was a
French-Canadian from Quebec, and dur-
ing his long Premiership (1896-1910) the
Empire had no abler or more faithful
servant. Another French-Canadian from
Quebec, Louis Stephen St. Laurent, is
likely to succeed William Lyon Mackenzie
King, first of all imperial Prime Ministers
in length of service, whose Dominion’s
immense war and post-war gifts to all
its allies and associates (Australia among
them and Soviet Russia, too, until Soviet
Russia repaid Canada with espionage, cor-
ruption and sedition) would have been
impossible without the support of
Quebec and its three million Catholics.
And the French-Canadian members
joined heartily with their fellow-Liberals
and their Conservative, Socialist and
Social Credit opponents in an address to
the “most gracious Sovereigns,” moved
and unanimously adopted in the House of
Commons at Ottawa on April 26. Part
of the address and the sequel, from the
London “Times”:
“As members of the Parliament of Canada
we are happy to avail ourselves of this
anniversary to express the warmth of the
feelings cherished towards your Majesties
by the Canadian people We trust that
your Majesties may long be spared to share
the happiness of life together and to enjoy
the affection of your peoples in all parts
of the British Comtaonwealth of Nations.”
Wholehearted approval by the entire
House was given by the singing of the
National Anthem and the giving of three
cheers for their Majesties.
April 26 was a Monday, and on the same
day “addresses of affectionate congratu-
lation on what Mr. Attlee called ‘this
essentially family festival’ ” were passed
in both Houses at Westminster. The
Parliament at Canberra never sits on a
Monday; Monday sittings, to borrow
from Mr. Beazley, are “entirely foreign”
to his party’s “idea.” And when the
Parliament did sit that week there was no
singing of the National Anthem or giving
of three cheers for their Majesties, as
there was at Ottawa. In what occurred,
if anything did occur (and if anything
did, the papers didn’t mention it), there
was nothing even remotely resembling
that display of loyal feeling, which came
from the heart and did not find Mr.
Beazley’s aversions wanting.
Yet the story of the proceedings in
London that Monday might well have in-
spired Mr. Beazley’s “Government” to
follow the Canadian example, even at the
cost of interrupting the debate on in-
crease of members from 111 to 182. To
good people everywhere, even on the
Continent with the Iron Curtain, it was
a moving story of a modest triumph,
human in all its phases, and, in its bear-
ing on the affairs of a war-wracked
world, more significant, deeply so, than
all the coups and heavily-guarded pro-
gresses of all the dictators.
In the morning the King and Queen,
their daughters and the Duke of Edin-
burgh drove from Buckingham Palace to
St. Paul’s for a thanksgiving service—in
open landaus. Along the Mall, the
Strand and Fleet-street, they went, “past
two miles of welcoming spectators,
massed many deep,” returning from the
great cathedral, where lie the bones of
Nelson and Wellington and many other
famous warriors, by way of the Em-
bankment, through other dense and full-
throated throngs.
And so to the Palace, from the balcony
of which the King, his Queen, hi§ mother
—still a stately figure—his brother and
the Duchess of Gloucester, the two young
Princesses and the Duke of Edinburgh
acknowledged gales of cheering for five
minutes ; and then to a midday meal. Not
a 36-course banquet, each course washed
down by a choice wine, with beakers of
vodka standing by, such as Stalin spread
before his guests when already 5,000,000
of his people were dead as a result of
his weak and treacherous policy, but
“a three-course luncheon.” On “the
round table” was “a single-tier silver-
wedding cake,” which was cut by the
Queen, and there was a single toast,
drunk in champagne.
When the April sun was going down
the King and Queen drove along 22
miles of East End and South London
streets —in an open car. For any dictator,
dictator’s deputy or stand-in man to
undertake such a journey in his own
capital would mean a short ride and a
sticky finish. From the people who
gathered in the Mile End-road and Com-
mercial-road, in Euston, Bethnal Green,
Camberwell and the rest —all still showing
cruel marks of the blitz —there came not
bombs pr bullets, but transports of
loyalty and affection. And night brought
the royal broadcasts, each in its way
excellent. That of the Queen expressed
in true womanly accents and feeling “the
wonderful sense of security and happiness
which comes from a happy home”:
Therefore at this time my heart goes out
to all those who are living in uncongenial
surroundings and who are longing for the
time when they will have a home of their
own. I am sure that patience, tolerance
and love will help them to keep their faith
undimmed and their courage undaunted
when things seem difficult.
It was in the same spirit that the
orphan boy in Dickens’s finest novel, a
home and a protector won at last,
“thought of all the solitary places under
the night sky where I had slept, and
prayed that I never might be houseless
any more, and never might forget the
houseless.”
April 26 was a day memorable in the
annals, not only of the House of Windsor,
but of the British, Commonwealth and
Empire. It is unfortunate that the Aus-
tralian “Government” and Parliament —
now “resting” once more—should have
failed to rise to the occasion, especially
as the King and Queen are coming to
Australia next year.
"Overworked Members."
“Jasby”:—
When the Bill to increase Federal members’
salaries was being debated much was made
of the point that the work of members had
become more onerous than in other days, and
the same argument is now being advanced
to support a scheme for increasing their
numbers. Apart from feeling that it is not
quite honest to give yourself a £5OO rise on
the grounds of extra work and then turn round
and cut your duties by half without returning
any of the dough, I find myself asking just
what these duties are that weigh so heavily on
the shoulders of the people’s representatives.
I know that at certain times of the year Par-
liament is in session and that members attend
more or less regularly and, according to their
ability and inclination, and subject to the
Speaker’s willingness to hear them, take part in
the debates. And I know that irrespective of
what they say or leave unsaid in the debates,
and irrespective of what they may really think
on the subject under discussion, they vote strictly
on the party line. But this does not seem to
be the sort of work they refer to when they
speak of higher salaries or smaller electorates.
What they complain about is the amount of
work they do for their constituents.
Now I have been a constituent of one or
another politician for 25 years. During that
time I have never written to a member; I have
never asked a member to do anything for me;
no member has ever sought me out. Over a
much longer period my father could say the
same thing, and I don’t know of a single mem-
ber of my family who has ever knowingly
taken up a moment of his local member’s time.
During the quarter of a century that has
passed since I cast my first vote —for the loser,
like most of my subsequent ones —I have lived
in four States and have known a considerable
number of people of varied callings. As far
as I have been able to ascertain they have
been *as guiltless as myself of taking up the
time of the nation’s legislators. In that period
I’ve listened to thousands of whinges, complaints
and grumblings, but I can’t recall a single in-
stance where the grumbler has told me “Ive
written to the local member about it.” The
only proof I have ever had of this allegedly
widespread habit of writing to members of
Parliament came to me in Army training-camps,
where, on several occasions, routine orders were
read out to the troops drawing attention to the
fact that the Army frowned on the practice of
soldiers writing to Ministers or private members
seeking their aid in getting out of the Army
or asking for redress of some grievance, real
or imagined. . ..
Of what type are the people who write tne
letters that make up the masses of correspon-
dence members complain of? Some, no doubt,
bring up matters of real interest to the com-
munity, but for every one who does there are
probably a score of cranks, whingers and log-
rollers whose affairs are not worth five minutes
consideration —unless the member is worrying
about how they will vote at the next election.
Which brings up the point: How much or me
“work” of which members complain is under-
taken by them for the purpose of “nursing
their electorate in order to ensure their tenure
of the seat? If an impartial examination could
be made it would probably be found that a
vast part of the “work” falls into this category
and, as such, is not properly work for which
the member is paid by the people.
It is time members of all parties got to-
gether and decided just where the duties and
obligations of a member towards his electorate
begin and, more important, where they end.
For where they end is the point at which log-
rolling and vote-catching begin.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Bulolo to Darlinghurst.
Last Wednesday there entered the dock
at Darlinghurst Quarter Sessions J. S.
(“Jock”) Garden, sometime secretary of
the Sydney Labor Council (20 years).
Communist candidate for Sydney (1925),
Labor M.H.R. for Cook (1934-37) and
“liaison officer,” with an office m the
Commonwealth Bank Building, Sydney,
to E. J. Ward when Ward was Minister
of Labor and National Service (1941-43),
and to Ward’s successor in that post, E. J.
Holloway (1943-47).
Garden was arraigned on three charges
dated during the period of Ward’s —con-
tinuing—Ministry of External Terri-
tories: forgery of a departmental letter,
November 20, 1945, fraudulent falsifica-
tion of a departmental letter, same date,
and forgery of another, November 10,
.1947—a1l relating to the affair of a New
Guinea timber concession in connection
with which, Crown Prosecutor Shand said,
two amounts of £12,500 and £37,500 were
paid by the Queensland firm of Hancock
and Gore. Accused pleaded not guilty.
Mr. Shand suggested that the defence
would be that Ward was the villain of the
piece.
Evidence-in-chief given last week was,
in substance, the same as that given in the
Court of first instance, and the cross-
examination, by Mr. Simon Isaacs, who
again appeared for Garden, was on the
same lines, though by no means a replica.
Mr. Shand hat stated that there was a
“conflict” between Ward’s testimony and
that of H. G. Forshaw, Hancock
and Gore’s logging manager, who
testified that his concern had paid the
£50,000, on “a point” arising out of a
Forshaw interview with the Minister in
Garden’s presence on November 8, 1947.
In the box Forshaw said “Mr. Ward
asked me to put my ideas on paper, and
at his direction I sent a letter, addressing
it to Ward but placing it in art envelope
addressed to Garden, with a covering
letter.” Ward swore that the first time
he knew Garden was concerned in “the
New Guinea timber proposition” was on
December 15, 1947.
Mr. Shand (to Ward): Did you tell
Forshaw to send his reply to Garden for
transmission to you? —Not to my recol-
lection.
Mr. Isaacs: Do you deny that you said
to Forshaw “Post the letter to Jock and
Jock can get it straight through to me
at Canberra”? —I do.
Ward denied also (1) that on Decem-
ber 3, 1945, Garden had brought into
his (Ward’s) office £5OOO in £lO notes ;
(2) that Garden had said it was his
(Ward’s) “cut” out of the first £50,000 ;
(3) that he had said to Garden “Take it
round to Bill Urquhart”; (4) that he
subsequently told Garden he had (a) got
his “corner” and it was going into his
safe-deposit at the Bank of New South
Wales, and ( b ) had made £6OOO out of
a deal with Mossie Hyams; and (5) that
Urquhart—a friend and close associate,
also a Labor and National Serviceman
and then a Security Officer —was his
“dummy at Pincombes,” a Sydney type-
writer concern. He admitted having, at
the end of 1945, recommended Urqu-
hart for a £2OOO-a-year job at Pin-
combes, declined by himself when
Pincombes expected to lose the agency
for Royal typewriters, and that “later”
Pincombes got an import-procurement
licence for another make of typewriter.
He did not get it for them, having passed
on their application to “the Minister of
Customs’^ —Keane was that until April,
1946.
The Minister was still in the box
when this report had to be broken off.
Vote "Yes'Mor Shoddy.
What the average Australian — particu-
larly where a wife or mother —will have
to consider about giving the Common-
wealth Socialist Government power to fix
rents and prices is the quality of the
goods that will be available under a
fixed-price system.
From the first control of prices during
the war until the present quality of
fixed-price articles has tended to deterio-
rate. Women know only too well the
shoddy footwear their children have been
wearing, the shoddy ready-made clothing,
house-linen and other manufactured and
fresh goods they buy. Shoddy, in fact,
is the rule today, even as regards work
at fixed wages—no employer dare openly
pay a good worker more than the award
rates for a bad one.
The same thing applies to rents. They
are fixed at pre-war or early-wartime
levels, whereas owners are up for higher
rates, higher costs of repair (most repair
work is week-end stuff at blackmarket
wages), higher taxes on the income from
rent. The result is that many owners are
reluctant to incur the heavy expenses of
house or shop repairs—or reluctant to
pay the blackmarket prices for labor and
material, both fixed-price commodities —
and tenants have to put up with it.
All this, bad as it is, is nothing to
the era of shoddy which would arrive
Under a Socialist Government given a per-
manent blanket power to fix prices—that
is what the Socialists are asking for on
May 29. The only logical result of a
“yes” vote on that day will be that
the people will have to accept shoddy
goods, shoddy work, shoddy services (for
where there is no competition there is
no incentive to produce a better article
or give a better service) and pay the
price fixed by their Socialist masters. It
may be said that quality will be main-
tained by Government inspectors. Was
it so maintained in footwear? Is the
quality of the service rendered by Gov-
ernment transport, for instance, as good
as that rendered by private transport?
There is already a cloud of inspectors
under the existing price-fixing system;
a “yes” vote will multiply them by thou-
sands, especially if quality as well as
price is to be policed.
Marshall Aid.
Aid to Europe under Washington’s final
version of the Marshall Plan is to be
smaller than first forecasts, and it appears
to have strings to it not formerly pub-
licised. On paper it is certainly not the
straightout gift of sustenance, so far as
Britain is concerned, anyway, that was
visualised by most people.
It appears that Britain has signed a
“letter of intent.” This lays it down that
Britain (1) will adhere to the policy of
the U.S. Economic Co-operation Act;
(2) will conclude a bilateral agreement
with the United States; (3) will take
necessary steps to make sterling deposits
commensurate with the amount of dollar
assistance; and (4) has signed the con-
vention for the organisation of European
economic co-operation.
Stafford Cripps revealed this much
when denying rumors that “under the
European Recovery Programme Britain
had agreed to give control of the sterling
area to the United States.” Precisely
what the four conditions really mean is
not clear, and there appears to be little
effort at clarification on either side of
the Atlantic. It did come out over the
week-end that the “sterling-deposits” con-
dition in the letter of intent meant that
Britain had agreed to deposit in a special
account “the sterling equivalent of every
dollar received under the Marshall Plan
in the form of grants,” and that this ster-
ling would “be available for administra-
tive expenses incurred by the United States
in the United Kingdom under the Eco-
nomic Co-operation Act, or for such pur-
poses as may be agreed to between the
two Governments.”
Possibly an array of conditions em-
bodied in the letter but not entirely con-
templated in the spirit. Congress likes
to see at least some nominal security for
its money. But the position is by no
means plain.
That "Larrikin Spirit."
It is infecting not only Our Foreign
Policy, as was said by Mr. Paul Hasluck
when parting company with the bird of
passage that “changes its plumage in
mid-flight,” but Our Immigration Policy,
with which is associated Our Deporta-
tion Policy, both embodied and expressed,
bluster and all, by Mr. Calwell.
Our Immigration Policy caters for all
sorts of persons from all sorts of places,
including Palestine, where there is a Cal-
well-avenue in Tel-Aviv.
If things go ill with the Jews in their
war with the Arabs, which they have a
first-class chance of losing, there is bound
to be an exodus of survivors to these
parts, and there are no apparent provi-
sions for identifying and keeping out
murderers such as those denounced by
the British Colonial Secretary as “con-
tinuing to blot the record of the Palestine
Jews.”
Another large party of unclassified
“Middle Europeans” arrived at the begin-
ning of the month in the Egyptian ship
Misr. Accused of having “flourished a
revolver in front of a deputation of first-
class passengers,” all Britons, who com-
plained that third-class passengers, all
“Middle Europeans,” were really too
cheeky and dirty, the Austrian-born
captain shied away from the specific
charge, but pleaded that he had to be
ready to use force against “migrants”
who “for years have lived by fighting”:
On my last trip Brigadier Lpsh told me
at least 44 of my passengers for Aus-
tralia were known gangsters.
Brigadier Lush, it was thoughtfully ex-
plained, is “chief of the Middle East sec-
tion of the refugee organisation.”
Our Deportation Policy is not aimed
at and is never applied to Communist
saboteurs of industry and transport —
they are merely “philosophers” and have
friends at Court. The Calwell admini-
stration of our traditional and essential
White Australia policy—which was well
and discreetly handled without inter-
national repercussions in most of the
years prior to the advent of Calwell and
Evatt —seeks out and strikes at friendless
creatures like the Chinese wife of a Perth
(W.A.) man and the Tonga-born wife and
children of another. The case of the
Chinese lady drew a cutting comment
from Professor Murdoch:
The husband was told it was his wife,
not himself, who was being sent away.
“What have you to complain about?” asks
Bill Sikes; “it’s only your wife I’m kick-
ing, not you.”
The Tonga lady found champions in
the House v To one of these, Dr. Page,
Mr. Calwell said with a sneer that nearly
cracked hiss face:
People are admitted to or excluded from
Australia on grounds other than those of
social importance, and the attempt by some
members to advance the claims of the
Tongan princess just because she happens
to be a cousin of a queen somewhere in
the Pacific leaves me cold.
Here room should be found for the re-
marks of an A.I.F. General:
Tasman described the Tongans as orderly,
industrious and peaceful people. They still
are. Compared with some of Mr. Calwell’s
immigrants, they* and the Maoris stand
high indeed. Their Queen did a fine job
in both world wars, and was decorated by
our King. Her sons were greatly-esteemed
scholars at Newington College, Sydney, dis-
tinguishing themselves at rowing, cricket and
'football and in the cadet corps. As for
Maoris, Mr. Calwell should ask Sir Bernard
Freyberg, V.C., what he thinks of them,
as soldiers and citizens, for the warrior
Governor-General is to visit Canberra
presently and is sure to mention Dr. Evatt’s
Anzac Pact. What the Diggers think of
their old companions of Gallipoli, North
Africa and Crete is no mystery, nor should
it be any mystery at Canberra that Maori
cadets have passed through the Royal
Military College at Duntroon, one becom-
ing an instructor there.
The reference to Maoris was prompted
by the fact that, with loutish insolence
unmatched in the relations between Aus-
tralia and New Zealand, Mr. Calwell
announced that a Maori soldier married
to an Australian woman would not be
allowed to settle in the Commonwealth.
Indignant protests came from Prime
Minister Fraser (“any discrimination
against our Maori fellow-citizens will be
an unforgivable insult to our country and
to every one of us”), from the chaplain
of the glorious Maori Battalion, and from
the president of the Second N.Z. Expedi-
tionary Force Association, and the N.Z.
High Commissioner made “representa-
tions” the nature of which can be easily
divined. And sheltering himself, as far
as he could, behind “my departmental
head,” the Minister for Immigration and
Deportation bent to the storm.
The clumsy, inconsistent and offensive
actions of Mr. Calwell are bound to make
it vastly more difficult to maintain our
cherished aim of a White Australia in
the face of overseas opposition which has
always had to be allowed for.
Jobbery and Wrecking.
The Oldest Inhabitant again:
If Federal “Labor” succeeds in driving one
of its new-model cars (dollars no object) through
the Commonwealth Constitution, Australia,
with a population of 7,600,000, will have 682
elected members next year. New Zealand (popu-
lation 1,650,000) has 80. In South Africa
(population, with natives and Asiatics, 9,000,000)
there are 322; in Britain (population 46,000,000),
615 in the present Parliament, to be reduced to
604 in the next; in Canada (population
12,500,000), 752. The other Dominions have
nominated Upper House members as well—3s
in New Zealand, 40 in South Africa and 120
in Canada.
Ministers of the Crown, including provincial
Premiers and Ministers without portfolio (six
of these in Quebec alone), are most numerous
in Canada —128. Britain gets along with 37,
New Zealand with 14 and South Africa with 12.
Australia possesses 81 at present, but “reasons”
will doubtless be found for adding to the num-
ber at Canberra (19) if the number of Federal
members is increased to 182. For years it has
rarely been possible to assemble a full team
of Commonwealth Ministers. Several have been
abroad for long periods at the same time. But
this consideration won’t matter if “Labor” can
give the plum-tree another shake.
This increase of members is a bad business,
and some of the “arguments” advanced for
it are beneath contempt. For the addition of
24 “Senators” to the present 36, who do little
but draw their salaries (raised from £lOOO to
£l5OO p.a. before those elected in 1946 took
their seats) and say Yes to the House, and
whose proceedings are so uninteresting that the
papers rarely report them, except when a bit
of “fill-up stuff” is needed, no argument was
advanced, only the plea that, under the Con-
stitution (flouted on other points), there couldn’t
be more Ms.H.R. without more Senators. And,
“arguing” for the addition of 47 Ms.H.R. (48
with the member to be given to the Canberra
establishment), Mr. Calwell got down to this
level: — *
The Government is doing something that
should have been done many years ago.
As the population of Australia increased,
so the number of electorates should have been
altered. Immigration plans make it possible
that by 1960 Australia will have a popu-
lation of 10,000,000, and the number in
each electorate will then have increased
from about 40,000, as proposed by the bill,
to about 53,000. A further increase will
then have to be made in the size of Par-
liament.
Which means, if it means anything, that, since
the population was 3,773,800 in 1901 and is
double that now, we should have double the
number of members; also, that should the
population grow till it becomes 25 times
the 1901 total, the number of members in 1901
should be multiplied by 25. Utter rubbish,
and so is Dr. Evatt’s contention that it is
impossible for an M.H.R. adequately to repre-
sent “about 65,000 electors,” wherefore the
average constituency must be reduced to 40,000
(his figures).
If there were anything in the Attorney-
General’s reasoning, Congress would have been
bogged down generations ago. In point of
fact, the U.S. House had one member to 60,450
people at its establishment in 1789, when com-
munications were primitive. It had one to
173,900 in the year we federated, one to 210,415
in 1911, and one to 304,000 in 1940. In that
year there was a Congressional district in
Illinois with 914,000 inhabitants. As for Senators,
who, according to Dr. Evatt, are overburdened
by representing an average of 213,000 electors.
New York has two Senators to 14,000,000
people, Pennsylvania two to 10,000,000, and
Illinois two to 8,000,000.
The continental population of the U.S.A.
was 76,000,000 in 1900 and is now round
150,000,000, but there has been no doubling
of members. Far from it. The number of
Senators has gone from 90 to 96, but only
because of the admission of three new States —
Oklahoma (1907), New Mexico and Arizona
(1912). There were 436 Ms.H.R. in 1911 and
435 in 1946. In the intervening period popu-
lations of Southern and Atlantic States declined
relatively to the total, and those of Middle-West
and Western States increased; hence losses and
gains of members.
In the country with the mightiest of Federal
unions, the one on which we modelled our
own, adding the British Cabinet system and
the Swiss referendum, there can be no such
thing as jobbery of seats by the Government
or by a predominant party clique. The
number of Representatives is fixed at 435.
“After each census the President transmits
to Congress a statement embodying the
mathematical computation and showing the
number to which each State is entitled” {Our
American Government ). Increase of Senators
can come about only by the admission of
new States, a process recognised as inseparable
from the healthy working of a Federal system.
As already mentioned, there have been three
during our Federal period, and before long
there will be two more —Alaska, with about
20,000 whites, and Hawaii, predominantly
colored.
There have been no new States in Australia
since 1901, and if “Labor” has its way there
never will be any. Great communities like
Riverina and New England and others that
could become great will be condemned for
all time to rule from Canberra, itself ruled,
except in the bureaucratic field, by city mem-
bers and mobs; and, in matters left to the
undivided States, these great communities will
be condemned for all time to suffer the imper-
tinences and injustices visited on them by such
“Governments” as Mr. McGirr’s.
Gas from Leigh Creek.
The German experts invited by Premier
Playford to look into the virtues or other-
wise of Leigh Creek for gas-making have
told him that it appears to be all right,
though questions of moisture- and ash-
content have still to be answered. The
idea is to make the gas at Port Augusta
and then pipe it to Adelaide and other
points, notably Port Pirie smelters.
Cost of a plant and lOin. pipeline to
Adelaide is estimated at £1,450,000. A
bigger plant and Min. pipe would cost
£2,390,000. Assuming that Leigh Creek
coal can be delivered to Port Augusta at
15s, a ton, production costs in Adelaide
would be 2s. 9.6 d. a thousand cubic feet
for the smaller plant, 2s. 5.9 d. for the
larger one, both comparatively low
figures. The experts say that Leigh Creek
coal could go direct into the generator,
whereas Moorlands coal would have to
be processed into briquettes before being
burned.
When he heard about it the manager
of the Port Pirie smelters announced with
restrained enthusiasm that if the coal
could be gasified cheaply and piped to
Pirie it could be used throughout the
“heat processes” of the smelters. Total
annual fuel cost of the smelters (coal and
oil) is now about £200,000 ; he seemed to
think that piped gas would cut that down
heavily.
His enthusiasm would be nothing to
that of Adelaide people. For years their
homes, factories and shops have suffered
frequent gas interferences, and they never
know from day to day what new whim of
N.S.W. coalminers will cut the gas off.
With a pipeline bringing them seven to
10 million cubic feet of gas a day from
their own coal, though of lower calorific
value than that from N.S.W. fuel, they
could laugh at N.S.W. coal strikes.
The Red-tape Army.
Still it grows: another 200 were added
to the Federal bureaucracy in the latest
recorded month, February, making the
snowball total 163,100, and for all Gov-
ernment employees in Australia over
575,000.
Protests against the way Government
employment is mopping-up people wanted
for industry, where acute labor shortages
are holding up every trade, drew from
Mr, Chifley last year an announcement
that an efficiency expert was to be sought
who would reorganise the Federal civil
service. That idea has gone overboard ;
there were no applicants deemed suffi-
ciently qualified- for the post. There, is
still no attempt to introduce what in
Britain is called the “organisation and
methods” department of the Treasury, to
modernise departmental staffs and pro-
cedure.
How necessary is some radical reshap-
ing of the bureaucratic system is shown
by the fact recorded last year that the
British Board of Trade alone had to

CARRERAS LIMITED - OVER 150 YEARS’ REPUTATION FOR QUALITY
handle 40,000 letters a day from people
requiring explanation of or relief from
Board of Trade regulations. There must
assuredly be comparable figures in Aus-
tralia.
The House of Commons lately re-
ceived a fifth report from its select com-
mittee on this subject of inquiry in which
the committee warned the Ministry:
It is essential that the Government should
put its own administration in order. In-
sufficient thought has been given to adapting
the machinery of Government to its new
tasks, and the administration is strained
almost to breaking-point New and great
responsibilities have been placed upon it,
particularly in regard to the nationalised
industries. There is danger that the major
Departments of State may become too
large and too cumbrous to work efficiently.
The committee urged a review “at the
highest level.” It quoted two instances
of wasteful staff numbers. In one de-
partment 20 typists had been • dispensed
with by the introduction of a photostat
machine, and in another 300 surplus staff
had been released for outside employ-
ment by “the replanning of the use of
accommodation.”
It is high time some such exhaustive
survey was made of employment in Gov-
ernment departments in Australia.
POLITICAL POINTS
The Coogee Assembly electorate dates
from 1927. Then, and for years after-
wards, most of the inhabitants were home-
dwellers. With “conversion” and the
building of flats a new population, com-
posed largely of unionists of both sexes,
moved in, only the racing element —-
always numerous and always predomi-
nantly “Labor” being unaffected by
the change in the composition of
the constituency, Cunningham, the
late member, had substantial major-
ities in 1941,1944 and 1947, and “Labor,”
while prepared for a reduction to 500 or
so, did not expect his widow to lose the
seat. Lost it was to the Liberal, Ellis, who
beat Mrs. Cunningham by nearly 1200
votes and ended with a comfortable abso-
lute majority over three opponents, one
of them a Communist whose name was
first on the ballot-paper—that always
means a few hundred votes by the care-
less and ignorant—but who nevertheless
forfeited his deposit.
The defeat at Coogee was such a facer
for “Labor,” State and Federal —the
latter crowd with the prices-and-charges
referendum coming on —that McGirr lost
his temper and made a fool of himself.
On the platform he had attacked Holl-
way, over from Melbourne to speak for
Ellis —they were R.A.A.F. training-school
companions—in terms and with “argu-
ments” worthy of a Sunday foot-
brawler. When it was all over McGirr
squealed that “the Liberal candidate,” de-
scribed as “a city lawyer with a lucra-
tive practice”—he gave up his practice
for years to serve his country —“was put
in by vested interests and money-power.”
This from the “leader” of a party which
is the fading hope of the Booze and Bet-
ting interests and the section of employers
that “scabs on its mates” during strikes;
from a Premier who took two city
lawyers with lucrative practices into his
Ministry and who himself belongs to one
of the wealthiest families in his State!
But let this Premier go on squealing;
squealing will accelerate the rout of the
N.S.W. “Labor” mobs.
The reason why the Italians didn’t give
their Christian Democrats so pronounced a
majority in the Senate as in the Chamber
of Deputies should interest a Senator in
these parts. A hundred and seven
Senators, 47 of them Reds, sit by right
other than elections. They qualified by
spending at least five years in jail for
political offences.
A Melbourne reporter, watching the
May Day procession in his city (the one
Sydney was to have had was, greatly to
the Commos’ relief, washed away by rain),
reckoned that at least 2000 of the 5000
marchers were Albanians, Greeks, Yugo-
slavs, Cypriots, Macedonians “and other
Central and Southern Europeans.” A
Communist show, of course; but there
was a strange omission. None of the
12.000 carried a banner extolling Com-
rade Calwell’s immigration policy.
Judge Kirby, chairman of the Steve-
doring Industry Commission, is visiting
N.Q, ports “to see what the commission
can do to help the interested parties to
get the sugar away from Queensland.”
The whole Sugar Coast knows that only
one thing is necessary—work. Just work.
While all the central-east coastal areas
were soaked, and newspapers were joy-
fully predicting a grand sowing season
for wheat and other crops, Central
Queensland had to read and grin rue-
fully. All the Hughenden and Winton
country was drought-stricken, and calls
were being raised for stock-trains to take
the starving animals away to agistment.
And bang in the middle of it is the
250.000 acres picked by the British Food
Mission to grow sorghum and pigs.
It is not true that a simple soul, asking
a policeman to tell him where he could
hear a discussion of “this prices-and-
charges business,” was directed to
Darlinghurst Quarter Sessions.
One of Dr. Evatt’s lieutenants has
fallen into disfavor in Greece, where he
is accused of having “contested the right
of the U.N.O. Balkans Commission to in-
terest itself in that hideous crime the
kidnapping of Greek children” and
“shown a desire to visit Sofia, Belgrade
and Tirana,” whence the kidnappers are
armed, supplied and egged-on. As if
that wasn’t bad enough, there is a
Granny “Herald” prize novel jeopardis-
ing our relations with another Small
Nation—all prickly these days :
The scene is Tibet. Salom, a Chinese
boy, finds luv for Veshti, the headman’s
beautiful daughter. The people of the
valley find themselves forced into resent-
ment and enmity. Yanong, a lecherous
priest, throws his weight about. Salom and
Veshti steal into a world of whirling white,
scourged by the whips of winter’s demons.
As the blizzard closes on them Veshti gives
herself as wife to Salom in the snow.
When the Tibetan translation appears
what chance will there be of adding Tibet
to the string of Small Nations that look
to Dr. Evatt for leadership?
There were elections in Korea on Mon-
day ; elections preceded by Communist
riots and shootings of candidates.
Not in northern Korea, where Rus-
sian masters boycotted the elections
and claimed the whole country, once the
Hermit Kingdom, for their Communist
stooges; but in the American zone. At
a meeting in Seoul, attended by 100,000
Koreans, the American General Dean
charged Moscow with having established
a totalitarian regime in northern Korea
and with having sabotaged the people’s
only hope of survival as an independent
State-unity. Perhaps with a great effort,
he refrained from turning his guns on
the “Australian” representative who
described South Korea as “an American
police State.”
The one thing certain about Palestine,
whether it falls into the hands of Jews
or Arabs, is that it will be bankrupt and
a ruin. The Jewish murder gangs have
not stopped at bombings shootings
and hangings of unarmed Tommies. They
have looted banks, destroyed buildings,
communications, industries, and raised
up for their people, guiltless as well as
guilty, a cold fury of hate among people
“dowered with the hate of hate.” Britain
was Palestine’s best export market. Mar-
ket as well as protection will go as a
result of the Jewish atrocities, the latest
of which was the murder of a blameless
English boy under his own roof-tree by
means of an infernal-machine secreted
in a book and posted in London.
One figure in the Eureka Youth Move-
ment will not see the Eureka Stockade
film, unless it is shown in jail in pur-
suance of the New Penology. Neighbors
found his mother dead in her home
at Annandale, Sydney; “her face beaten
in, the forehead, eye-sockets, nose and
jaws smashed to pieces.” Her 21-year-old
son, the Communist disciple, had done it
all with “a four-pound hammer.” After-
wards “he had a ‘schooner’ of beer and
a meal at a Communist club”; then
he “went to a meeting of the Eureka
Youth Movement, and then by the
10.15 p.m. train to Waterfall, where
he camped with his mates.” A too-
merciful jury reduced the murder charge
to manslaughter, and the Judge gave the
matricide 12 years. Hanging would have
been too good for him.
The Beaverbrook Press lias come out

Rupert Ryan would oblige by becoming

Like Menzies and Laurence Olivier,
Fadden had a raw deal from A.8.C., and
excuses for the cutting-short of speakers
whom people want to hear are wearing
thin. All the same, interruptions did not
prevent Artie getting in some good stuff,
touched with humor, as to the idiosyn-
crasies of Canberra price-control, which
costs £750,000 a year in salaries alone:
Birdseed? Some genius worked out the
price of 576 different brands and ordered
grocers to observe them —or else.
Prawns? Fishmongers have to weigh
them, count them and then consult a chart
prescribing 10 different prices for cities and
others for country towns.
Vegetables? There were 17 different noti-
fications as to parsnip and carrot prices in
the 1944 “Commonwealth Gazette.”
What is a “first-quality egg”? Prices
Regulations Order No. 2416 defines it for
you: One which is “clean, uncracked,
neither thin nor misshapen and free from
stain and bloodspots”; an egg with “faintly-
visible yoke when candled, with the white
translucent and firm, with an air-cell slightly
tremulous and a quarter of an inch in
depth.”
Fadden’s style may be homely, but at
times it is very effective.
Menzies had a great referendum meet-
ing at Brisbane’s City Hall, and, always
inspired on such occasions, he was at the
top of his form. One example:
If it takes 40 days in the High Court
to argue the meaning of the word “bank-
ing,” it might easily take 400 to argue the
meaning of “prices and charges.”
It might indeed be construed by “Labor”
to apply to any transaction except such
as Goldberg’s dollar purchase of goods
(over 4000 dollars’-worth) for Keane.
A flour-tax conundrum for Tas-
manians :
The Treasurer has declared that the
amount by which the price per ton of
flour, based upon the price of wheat per
bushel free on rail at Williamstown in the
State of Victoria on that date, is less than
what, in the opinion of the Wheat Stabili-
sation Advisory Committee, the price of
flour would be if that price of wheat were
ss. 2d., is nil.
Poser from the Tasmanian junior-school
arithmetic? No, a “Commonwealth
Gazette” announcement which is giving
Hobart flourmillers a headache.
McGirr to the Premier of the best of
the few remaining customers for N.S.W.
coal:
He comes here and asks us to send
Victoria more coal! We give miners
£240,000 a year, including £BO,OOO for
pensions and £70,000 for amenities. Mr.
Hollway doesn’t contribute a brass farthing;
but he says “I must get more coal.” Im-
pudence!
So, in the McGirr view, the customer is
always wrong. Still, if the McGirr pubs
and pharmacies had been run on the prin-
ciple that the customer should pay a sur-
charge, in addition to profit, towards staff
pensions and “amenities” on every pint
of beer and bottle of medicine, they
wouldn’t have lasted long.
Federal “Labor” Ministers seem to run
a more-or-less friendly competition for
the honor of making the silliest remark
of the week. Rivalry is keen, and often
a photo-finish is needed to decide the
winner, but last week Dedman romped
home with a bit about Communists in
the Public Service, saying “the great
majority of them hold positions in which
it wouldn’t be possible for them to have
access to official secrets.” To be told
that the great majority of sharks in the
broad ocean were unable to get inside
the safety-net might be reassuring to
swimmers, but they would feel a darned
sight safer if they knew the ones that
had got through had been caught.
There were Leg. Council elections in
Westralia and Tasmania on Saturday,
and they were disastrous to two poli-
ticians of note. In the West, to Cole-
batch (Premier, Minister, Agent-General,
Senator and A.-G. again); in the Speck to
Worsley, the “Labor” Minister of Forests.
A Worsley plea, unprecedented as well
as unavailing, was that Ms.L.C. on the
other side would like to see him returned.
There is now only one “Labor” member
in the House which is expected to send
the Cosgrove “Government” to the
country: Dogracing D’Alton, who also
was Minister of Forests —once. He is
sure of office again.
There are suggestions from Europe
that the next few months may see the
integration of Eastern European States
into “Czechopolonia” and “Bulgoslavia.”
Outlandish as the names sound, they
don’t really matter much; both are
merely alternative ways of spelling
Russoslavia.
Always meddling in municipal affairs,
the Sydney Minister of Local Govern-
ment —no other State has one—imposed
compulsory voting on councils. One re-
sult is that hundreds of thousands of
persons qualified to vote at last year’s
municipal elections have been ordered
to explain why they didn’t or pay the
appropriate penalties. An unforeseen
consequence was a great fall in the
“Labor” vote in the Coogee-Randwick
neighborhood and the loss of a muni-
cipal seat held by Our Party for 10
years. And there followed “Labor’s” de-
feat in last Saturday’s Coogee Assembly
by-election.
In the debate on the Bloated Parlia-
ment, Anthony drew attention to the
preponderance of men in country elec-
torates, instancing New England and
Riverina, and of women in city elector-
ates. “ ‘Labor’ Governments,” which
have interfered in most phases of
human activity, shy away from one
avenue where they might be useful. They
leave matrimony to Private Enterprise.
Communist-controlled wharfies have
one rate of loading for Communist ships
and another for “capitalist” ships, even
those bearing food for Britain. A Tito
vessel, the Radriik, was tied up to an
Auckland wharf destitute of overhead
cranes and cargo-handling gear such as
the other Auckland wharves possess.
Rate of loading general cargo into the
Radnik was 27 tons per net gang-hour.
The port average for 1947 was 16.35
tons per net gang-hour.
If the P.M. is really interested in causes
of failing production, let him visit the
McGirr lott’ry office any day between
9 a.m. and 4 p.m. There, if he doesn’t
get squashed to death in the crush, he'll
see thousands of people, many in their
work-clothes, stamping, shoving, sweating,
cursing in the effort to get near the ticket-
windows. If “Labor” must encourage
gambling why not limit ticket sales to
non-working hours?
McKenna, the Social Services Minister,
at Castlemaine (Vic.):
No man in this country with a family of
any size is paying any taxation. It is
coming back in one item alone child
endowment.
The audience seemed sceptical.

SOCIETY "AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Findy”; Sydney County Council
mightn’t be much chop when it comes to
providing “consumers” with electric light
and power, but as neighbors they must
be hard to beat. Occupying the greater
part of the floor-space of that ornately
shabby pile, the Queen Victoria Market
Building, owned by their first cousin, the
Sydney City Council, they do their best,
by means of window and floor displays,
to push the sales of electric stoves and
ranges, hot-water systems, bath-heaters
and radiators. Willing and eager to sup-
ply “consumers” with electrical appli-
ances to lighten their darkness, to keep
them warm in winter and their food cool
in summer, the Council will accept cash
or arrange “easy terms,” and is unde-
terred by the fact that every gadget sold
means a greater strain on overloaded
Bunnerong, and, consequently, more
blackouts and more restrictidns. Where
does the good-neighbor policy come in?
Well, a fellow-tenant of the Queen Vic,
also has a window display—spirit-lamps,
spirit-stoves, oil-cookers and similar
items for which there would be very little
demand if Bunnero’ng was doing its job
and blackouts were unknown.

“Nakh”; Add to the already vast bulk
of Lawsoniana the discovery in Mel-
bourne that the poet was once a bus-
conductor. An officer of the Tramways
Board, searching the archives, has found
on a dusty sheet of foolscap one of the
most succinct, comprehensive and com-
plete records of a poet’s activities that
historians could wish for. It stated that
“Watch that he doesn’t float to the ceiling like
the last one , Sister.”
George Henry Larsen, employed by the
Melbourne Omnibus Company, had
punched tickets on the Melbourne-St.
Kilda route from April 21, 1893, to
June 19, 1896. A mysterious allusion to
his work as a conductor not being as
satisfactory as his work as a poet and
author may possibly mean that he was
more interested in studying human nature
than in seeing that down-and-outers didn’t
get free rides.
* * * *
“M.’s Boy”; These modern wonders
have their drawbacks, as Joe Dundee, ex-
welterweight champ., discovered. He
owns a pub in New York, and not long
ago installed a television-set therein. _ At
a wrestling match an announcer asked
him to say a few words over the television
network. Thinking only of his own pub,
he waved a grandiloquent hand and said
to his barman “Give everyone a drink
on me.” But the gesture had gone to
every other television-set in the city, and
when Joe got home some time later the
barman was still flat-out serving free
drinks to callers from far and near. It
recalls the time when an English XI
played a Riverina team and Pataudi, a
wealthy Indian nabob, called for drinks
for everybody in Bellairs’ old Commercial
Hotel. Tis said the word went rapidly
out to Colinroobie, Mangoplah, The
Rock, Woomargama, Rand and points be-
tween, and by dawn Pataudi found him-
self up for nearly £lOO.

“Cauboy”: First recorded performance
of “School for Scandal” in Melbourne was
at the opening of the old Theatre Royal
on July 6, 1850, when A. H. Rogers was
Sir Peter and Mrs. Charles Poole Lady
Teazle. The most notable was that of the
late Allan Wilkie at the King’s in the
thirties after that redoubtable actor-pro-
ducer had been driven on the financial
rocks by William Shakspeare. Having
failed to move the Government of the
time to grant him a subsidy Wilkie was
contemplating giving up the stage alto-
gether. As a forlorn hope Mrs, Hunter-
Watts suggested reviving post-Restoration
comedy, but nobody anticipated the boom
that followed. For the next few months
the King’s resembled the Princess at the
present moment, and the theatrical
horse not only recovered the fortun*e the
Bard had lost him but made another. He
then returned to his dream of being the
first producer to perform the whole Shak-
spearian canon. The Bard dished him
for the second time just as he had got
into double figures.

“Nejos”: St. Ives, Cornwall, birthplace
of Sir John Quick, is to have a memorial
in h'onor of “one of the country’s greatest
sons.” In St. Ives’ Council Chamber
there already hangs a framed photograph
of Quick —one of our greatest construc-
tive statesmen. The cottage where he was
born at Trevega, just outside St. Ives, still
stands. The statesman’s determination is
one which should still inspire every young
Australian. Shortly after his arrival in
Bendigo, as a boy, his father died. His
young mother, with financial help from
the Cornish miners, started a dressmaking
business, but could not keep her young
son at school, and he left at 12 to work
in a mine battery. He later became a
compositor and reporter on the Bendigo
“Independent,” obtained his law degree
at the University of Melbourne and
started the final move which led to the
federation of the Australian States.

“Ray Whiting”; After months of pant-
ing gun-drill at Pucka, we left for the
Middle East with a degree of smug pity
for the rookie gunners
left behind. There hasn’t
much they could teach us
about guns—until we hit
Nuseirat, where the
Artillery Training Regi-
ment hung out, and then
we came to earth with a
sweating thud. As a
newcomer I was always
copping the “orderly
dog’s” job. What I dis-
liked most about it was
the O.C.’s habit of send-
ing me down to the gun-
park before daybreak to
clang open the breech of
a 25-pounder and slam it
closed again, the idea
being to see if the blokes
on picquet were doing
their job and not nap-
ping in slit-trenches The
picquet was armed with
“wog-bashers”—in plain
Australian, pick-handles.
If there was no challenge,
a scream from the O.C.
somewhere in the black-
ness shoved the whole
picquet under arrest; if
I got donged with a pick-handle all was
well.

“D. Matie”: Garden Island —with
Captain Cook Dock, now the best-
equipped naval base in the southern
hemisphere—is interesting in its own right.
It is recorded in the log of H.M.S. Sirius
that on February 11, 1788, a party of
men was sent to plant vegetables there
for use of the ship’s complement. The
carvings on a rock at the island’s northern
end—FM 1788 and IR 1788 —presum-
ably made by these early visitors, are
probably the first carvings of white men
on our eastern shore. Two rocky hum-
mocks, with a saddle in which the gardens
were dug, topped the island. The
southern one was levelled for building
sites, but the northern one, crowned by
the present signalling-station, remains.
Mr. Ellis Bent, Sydney’s Judge Advocate,
was buried in a vault there after his re-
mains were removed from the George-
street cemetery (the present site of the
Town Hall). Most interesting point today
“Hey, Ma! The young devil's pulled the plug out again!"
is that the island is not an island —
170,000 ft. of sheet-piling and 800,000
cubic yards of stone now join it to Potts
Point.

“Carlyle” : When “Barwell’s Bulls” (B.
21/4/’4B) were ranging the railway-lines
of South Australia, Harold Clapp held
office as Commissioner of the Victorian
Railways. This was too good an oppor-
tunity to miss, and Cabbage-patchers re-
taliated by calling their rail-motors
“Clapp’s Cows”!
• * * «
“Zake”: The concourse of delegates
in the big hall, as caught by the newsreel
cameraman, is quite impressive. In the
foreground, in the costumes of the re-
publics they represent, are three elderly
female battle-axes whose lineaments make
those of a cathedral gargoyle seem almost
beautiful. Suddenly all became tense as
a short, stocky man shuffles in, looks
aimlessly around and Wanders towards a
seat. As he is moving the delegates clap
vigorously. Across the face of the stocky
man flits a sheepish grin, though the
Oriental eyes don’t reflect it. Each dele-
gate, perhaps with an eye to the pos-
sible consequence if he doesn’t appear
sufficiently enthusiastic, tries to outdo
every other delegate in thunderous tri-
bute to their hero. Said handlebar-
moustached hero slips another sickly grin
and starts to join in the handclapping to
himself. And who is this shrinking
violet? Why, who else but that model
of modesty. Uncle Joe, come to the
Presidium meeting in the Kremlin to
bear if all the boys— and the battle-axes
—can still say “Yes” the right way.
» * * *
“Jemac”: An interesting and little-
known Naval invention used during the
war’s latter stages was a camera using
photo-electric cells to measure muzzle-
velocity—the speed at which a shell leaves
the gun. The problem—an important
one, as decreased m.-v. through wear
had to be allowed for in elevation —was
previously solved by complicated calcula-
tions involving temperature of charge,
bore of the gun, number of rounds fired
and so on. Now a round is fired over two
cameras spaced a few yards apart on a
ship’s deck. The shell’s flight operates
both, and an automatic recording of the
split second between their operating gives
the shell’s speed simply and quickly.
* * * *
“Craiser”: A first-year law student
offered a solution of the Olivier queue
problem to a group of patrons of the
drama who were standing disconsolately
in Collins-street, having twice been moved
on by a policeman. “Stand three feet
behind one another,” he whispered, “and
you won’t come under the definition.”
They solemnly obeyed his instructions,
but the John moved them on just the
same.
* * * •
“Ceg”: Let’s start with the hat. It has
twice been to the cleaners, and with a new
band doesn’t look so bad. The suit was
well tailored in 1938 and still keeps its
shape. “Well worn” would be a master-
piece of understatement; Providence is
tempted daily so far as the trousers go,
and a sudden stoop might spell disaster.-
Careful manipulation ensures that the
frayed edges of the cuffs don’t come too
much into prominence. The shirt is of
the Dedman variety; bobtailed, poor
quality and patched where the collar
makes contact. Cuffs have been turned
and a new neckband made by cutting a
piece from the already attenuated tail.
The tie is washable, and with each wash-
ing becomes paler. Shoes match the rest
of the outfit and are neatly cracked across
the toes. The whole effect is “Burling-
ton Bertieish,” but the wearer has never
strolled down Piccadilly and is never
likely to. He is not a remittance-man or
a deadbeat. He has an income-tax re-
ceipt in his pocket, and he also has what,
in any other but Chifley’s Golden Age,
would count as a good job. Yes! you’ve
got it—a family man of the Australian
middle class.
♦ * *
“Coral Cod”: At a talkie show in a
N.Q. sugar town thfe voice of the
travelogue commentator began to de-
scribe the importance of sugar in the
economy of Cuba, the land depicted.
Illustrating the comment a native wearily
pulled a cane towards him, slowly
trashed and topped it, after which it was
as slowly loaded on an ox-cart, all move-
ments at the tempo of an Australian
civil servant on Monday morning. A
delighted roar and pungent comment went
up from the audience, for here in Aus-
tralia’s tropics canecutting is a real job
of work, even in these days of “depend
upon Uncle Ben.”

“Exiled Annie” airmails her impres-
sions :
London may be starving, but it makes Sydney
look like Newgate the day before a hanging.
Whitehall is gay with window-boxes of pink
and blue hydrangeas, hyacinths and cinerarias,
not to mention the reblossomed splash of
scarlet uniform at the Horse Guards. It is
Cup-final Week, and we have the Royal silver
wedding on top of that. Cup-week crowds are
something to see —and hear. “Waltzing Matilda”
is one of their tunes this year, and no pro-
vincial visitor feels he is dressed without a
rosette proclaiming his loyalties. These are
startling affairs up to 18in. long, and are usually
set off with a cap or bowler decorated with
half a yard of colored ribbon. Lest this should
not be enough to attract attention some of the
wearers carry rattles —and sing into the bar-
gain! The silver wedding was a heart-moving
show, magnificently organised—not to say tele-
vised, for they televise everything here including,
this year, the cricket and the Olympic Games.
The roofs, pavements and every other vantage-
point were packed to the limit, and one enter-
prising firm opposite Australia House even
cleared out its window and filled it with spec-
tators. Churchill got the biggest cheers —we
heard the roar a mile away as he came up
the Strand. Attlee and his friends seemed to
be scarcely noticed; they were a drab lot
beside the Royal party. They certainly under-
stand the art of pageantry in this allegedly
worn-out and bankrupt country. First came
mounted police on snow-white horses, then
Household Cavalry—gleaming breastplates, white
plumes, scarlet tunics and snowy white sheep-
skins, the officer-in-charge of each detachment
with an embroidered saddlecloth; the horses,
all of the darkest bay, perfectly matched, trot-
ting with exact pace. Next, the Royal car-
riage drawn by the Windsor Greys, the postil-
lions in scarlet and gold, with white breeches,
the Queen in misty blue sitting in a landau,
lined rosecolor, with an enormous bouquet of
roses to match, and the King in his Admiral’s
uniform splashed with gold and the color of
ribbons. I liked the show at the Palace best.
They had a broadcasting system out in front,
and everybody sang in the intervals between
yelling the chorus: “We want the King! We
want the Queen! ” in tones that could have been
heard in Edinburgh, ihe Palace was floodlit,
and there were balloons which bounced about
on the heads of the crowd. The piece de resis-
tance of the evening was when one of the upper
windows of the Palace disclosed a female form
garbed in a dressing-gown and waving a pink
arm. When the Royal party came they were
just members of the family, and Philip wore
a tie which fairly reached out into the courtyard
in a blaze of reds and yellows.
EAST AND WEST.
“Japan is now firmly oriented in the fundamentals
of democracy.” —General MacArthur.
A curiously-chosen word, MacArthur,
Tins “oriented.” I wouldn’t be surprised
If what you meant to say wouldn’t be rather
Better expressed by “occidentalised,”
The very opposite which (so assever-
ates my consulting diction’ry at least)
Connotes the West’s perpetual endeavor
To westernise the East.
Your work is educating Orientals
Out of their pet ideas, we all agree,
And guiding them towards the fundamentals
Of safe and sound and sane democracy.
And if your prospects of success increase as
Your term of tutorship is nearly o’er,
You will have done as fine a job In peace as
We know you did in war.
But “Scratch a Russian and you find a Tartar”
Some proverb counsels us, and well it may,
As wary diplomats and statesmen smarter
Than most are learning to their cost today,
A melancholy fact that hasn’t lightened
Something of apprehensiveness mayhap
In speculating what you might or mightn’t
Find should you scratch a Jap.
They may have had their lesson, and repented
Of all the follies they were taught of old,
And settled down, resignedly contented,
Firmly resolved to go the way they’re told.
But if it isn’t wishful thinking merely,
And if they’re firmly started on the track
To better things,'who is there won’t sincerely
Murmur “Good on you, Mac”!

counting on the Buckshee Balsam Bill as
a vote-reviver to save “Labor” from
impending rigor mortis, may themselves
need a strong tonic (gratis) when they
fell) the full effects of the frustration and
disillusionment among women when the
trek to the family chemist begins in
earnest. Already the first rumblings have
been heard, even before the scheme has
officially started; suburban chemists,
especially in the industrial areas, are curs-
ing the pill that the cheer-chasers of the
Molonglo have rolled for them. Demands
in advance are being made from every-
thing from aspirins and A.P.Cs. to sun-
tan liquid stockings; one dispenser of
jalap tore out what little was left of his
hair in trying to convince an angry woman
that nothing could be obtained without a
doctor’s prescription and that, in any
case, dog-soap, cornplasters and Psyche's
Blush nail-polish couldn’t be interpreted
as medicines under the Act, when and if
it came into force. Could Congreve skip a
couple of centuries and bob up in Aus-

self an encore for his line about hell hav-
ing no fury like a woman scorned.

“Dong”: Browsing in a Sydney dis-
posals-store among “exploder aynamos
—give kiddies endless fun,” and some
fur-lined flying-suits “ideal for camp-
ing,” the wearing of which would prob-
ably result in one being shot for a bear,
or at least give rise to legends about yet
another Tantanoola Tiger, I came upon
some small metal cubicles with sides of
purple glass entitled “Windproof Candle
Lamps.” Taking into account Sydney’s
power situation and my very well-venti-
lated flat, I nearly bought one, but de-
cided the glass was so deeply tinted that
lighting the thing in the home could only
make the blackout gloomier. The assist-
ant told me that he didn’t have any with
plain glass, “but you’ve only got to knock
out the purple stuff and there you are.”
There I’d be with my candle blowing out
with the same alacrity as if I’d stuck it
in a bottle. In the end I decided to chance
a small tin of “paint” (color unspecified).
When I got home I found it was honey.

“Fleck”; Plane trips by amateurs, is
it? In the days when Qantas evacuated
troops fr.om New Guinea for sick leave,
Bill and George, proclaiming themselves
as ground staff doing maintenance,
amused the plane-load of troops while
they waited for pilot and co-pilot. Time
arriving for the scheduled departure, Bill
and George became quite concerned,
muttering that it wasn’t like the old firm.
Rather than let the honor of their em-
ployers be besmirched by a late departure
they went over the controls, and finally
agreed that they might be able to navi-
gate it; they’d give it a try, anyway. The
soldiers watched them arguing about the
controls, and then, suddenly, the engines
roared into life, and after another moment
of arguing, the kite trundled, wobbling,
along the airstrip and rose just in time to
clear the jungle, this bringing a delighted
“ Haven't I told you before to use a bottle-opener when We have
company ?”
whoop from Bill. There was still much
argument about the function of this or
that instrument, and some swooping low
over the water along the Queensland
coast. A good landing was effected, and
the half-paralysed troops crawled forth,
their wan appearance convincing the
M.O. they needed at least an extra
month’s leave. Bill and George, back-
loaded, made a perfect take-off, and flew
sweetly towards New Guinea, as they had
been doing for the previous six months.

“Craiser” : Shaw, in his “Dark Lady
of the Sonnets,” describes Shakspeare as
getting his magnificent vocabulary of
poetic phrases from sutlers, grooms, cook-
maids and Elizabethan soldiery. He is
quite right. The language is made not in
universities but in the streets and public
houses. Heard a bloke in a bar in Mel-
bourne trying to describe a lady of his
acquaintance whose nose turns up with
scorn and contempt of the world. “She’s
that way,” he said, “that if she got into
a decent shower of rain she’d drown.”

“C.Q.”: Melbourne National Gallery
has had to face fierce philistine criticism
every time it —or rather the Felton—buys
an expensive Old Master, but it has never
had to deal with the sort of protest the
City Art Museum of St. Louis (U.S.A,)
had to deal with when it bought a cat.
It was a bronze Saite cat which cost
14,000 dollars, and there was an immedi-
ate uproar. The newspapers started a
campaign against the purchase on the
ground that it was the wrong time to buy
works of art when there was hardship
and unemployment. The authorities
ignored the protest until hordes of live
cats began to arrive by post addressed
to the museum. The tally of felines had
reached several hundreds, and the whole
city was suffused with merriment, before
the postal department woke up and
stopped the traffic.

“B. A. Ker”: That “Green hill far
away without a city wall” (B. 7/4/’4B)
was a Sunday-school mystification to me
also. A quarter of a century later, when
I became a technical teacher, the am-
biguous word arose again. I remember
th& stunned look on the faces of my class
when they read on a geometry sheet:
“Problem 3: To draw a parallel to a
given line through a given point without
it ” How anything could be a given point
when you hadn’t got it, and how a line
could be drawn through it, were obvi-
ously problems too big for Australia’s
future bricklayers. Inspiration struck
me: I crossed out “without” and wrote
in “above.” The lines on their foreheads
vanished like taxpayers’ petrol in a Can-
berra limousine.

“Cauboy”: The New Zealand ex-
servicemen who run the variety show at
the Comedy, Melbourne, are a new
phenomenon in theatrical history. Without
a single glamor-girl in the cast and with
an all-male array of talent, even if some
of it is skirted, they have succeeded in
entertaining Melbourne for over two
years and have just given their 565th
performance, an all-time Melbourne
record. Demand for seats is so great that
the end of the Kiwis’ season is not in
sight by a long chalk.

“Jasby”: I have to thank Cole’s
Bohemians (B. 5/4/’4B) for my first
introduction to the theatre. At one time
Cole made the Port Adelaide Town Hall
his winter headquarters, and for a while
we kids deserted the Saturday film
matinees and passed over our sixpences
for the more robust flesh-and-blood fare
purveyed by the Bohemians. Beaucheous
Vene Linden was prime favorite, closely
followed by the company’s stock
comedian, whom at this late day I recall
only as Ginger. There was a part for
Ginger in every show, even if it had to
be written into the script. His biggest
triumph came in one melodrama, the
name of which I have forgotten. Vene
Linden, refusing the advances of the vil-
lain, had been thrust into the cage of a
monster bear. She shrank away in terror
as the huge animal shambled towards her.
We had seen “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” “Ned
Kelly,” “Captain Starlight” and numerous
other spine-chillers, but we felt Vene was
for it this time. She cowered in a corner ;
the bear raised his forepaws, lifted off
his head, remarked “It’s all right. It’s
only Ginger,” replaced his head and
went on with the act.

“Adelaide”: South Australia, which
supplies most of Australia’s wine, pro-
poses to hold a serious Vintage Festival
for next year’s Royal visit, which will
come just at the right season. The current
one stages a barbecue of three oxen,
grapejuice wine pressed from half a ton
of grapes, a “daughter of Bacchus”
locally appointed after keen competition,
and quite half the night spent in dancing.

“Plop”: Workmen have come to check
our building’s fire-escapes, husky fellows
whose hacksaws and hammers make the
rusty iron sing like Sinatra. But they are
not appreciated by those trying to think
within the building, and it wasn’t surpris-
ing yesterday when old Fred “did his
’nana,” hurled up his window and begged
the nearest workman to try to raze the
building a little more quietly. The reply
was accented by particularly ringing
blows: “I’ll hammer as much as I like.
These steps are so rusty it’s hard to find
metal in ’em. They’ve all got to be
taken up, scraped and painted with red-
lead. It’d be terrible if there was a fire
with ’em like that. Totally unsafe.” Fred
looked down at the section of the escape
below his window from which the iron
steps had already been removed. “Un-
safe!” he bellowed. “Well, tell me what
the blazes I’ll do if there is a fire now.
Swing down the rails with my tail?”
Satisfied, Fred slammes his window.

“Kelms”; The Syrian winter of ’4l-’42
couldn’t compare with the Somme of
T6-T7, but it was cold enough for a
Westralian infantry company which was
doing the spadework on a miniature tank-
trap, draped across the Bekaa Plain. One
evening a pick dropped out of sight, and
the hole it made provided gruesome and.
smelly evidence that we were trespassing
on someone’s family vault. We sus-
pended operations for the day and tramped
back to camp through a snowstorm that
should have discouraged any nocturnal
wanderings. Yet, when we returned in
the morning, the grave was empty..
Either the Syrians were hardy enough to
laugh at that weather, or they valued
the bones of their ancestors higher than
acute personal discomfort.

“Gravelsnatcher”; Aptly-named trains
(B. 21/4/’48)? Don’t know if it’s still
running, but during the depression days
“The Sloper” steamed out of Kalgoorlie
in the early hours of each morning carry-
ing a fair sprinkling of debt-dodgers, who
were sloping to avoid embarrassing the
landlord. It was a source of revenue for
one enterprising carrier who met depress-
ing circumstances with the slogan, “Why
pay rent when I’ll shift you any hour of
the day or night?” The police finally
objected to his advertising methods, but
he was still in business when I left Kal.
BY LAMPLIGHT.
“Most Senators do a jolly good job.”
—Senator Lamp ( Tas .).
No man, you will find an old proverb depone,
Should ever be judge in a case of bis own;
That self-praise is no praise is just as well-
known.
But this isn’t sufficient to cramp
The style of this voluble bird from the Speck
Or stop him from voicing his views through his
neck.
It takes more than proverbs to curb or to check
The prattle of Senator Lamp.
He’s out for his pals and himself to bespeak
Fair does, and to shield them from popular
pique, . , ,
The chaps who draw thirty, or nearly, a week
For merely affixing a stamp,
A sort of o.k. to what Chifley and Co.
Have licked into shape in the Chamber below,
Supplying good value thereby for their dough
According to Senator Lamp.
though seldom they bend to their oars, it’s
allowed,
And never for long, yet you’ll find in the crowd
Staunch democrats such as we ought to be proud
To have in the Government camp.
Stout fellows of light and of leading are there
Who at home or abroad have accomplished
their share
Of hitting front pages, by land or by air,
He’ll warrant you, Senator Lamp.
They’re doing good work, he assures us he
knows.
And just what it is should you ask, I suppose,
You may find from the Flansards in regular
rows
That cumber most newspaper shelves.
Whatever half-bricks at our Senators whiz,
He holds them engaged in beneficent biz.,
And few, I imagine, will question it is
A jolly good job—for themselves.

THE SERVICE MAN
B.C.O.F. Cleared.
“Ek Dum”: The report of the
Reverend A. J. Stewart, the
Presbyterian Chaplain-General
on the conduct of the troops of
8.C.0.F. was only what was to
be expected. The very appear-
ance and behavior of the troops
themselves on leave and the
records and reputations of their
officers rendered ridiculous the
Government’s action in sending
a topheavy commission of in-
quiry to Japan to investigate
charges which were made anony-
mously and apparently were not
even put in writing by the author
of them save in a newspaper.
Mr. Stewart said that he be-
lieved the statements about the
moral tone of the troops to be
out of all proportion to the
facts; that the character and
conduct of the men serving with
8.C.0.F. were in keeping with
the traditions of the A.I.F. at its
best; that V.D. was at a mini-
mum considering the conditions.
He said that the committee of
inquiry was amazed at the ex-
tent of the amenities provided
and that no Australian troops
had ever been better served by
canteens, Red Cross, Y.M.C.A.
and Salvation Army. References
to blackmarketing appeared to
be unfounded.
Everything possible was being
done to make sure that troops
returning to civil life would be
improved in educational and
cultural standards. The troops,
however, were not availing
themselves fully of the facilities.
In view of the likely serious
impact on recruiting of the kind
of charges which were thrown
about reflecting gravely on both
the morality and morale of the
soldiers, it is a pity that the in-
quiry did not take another form,
so that the members of the
force might have had an oppor-
tunity to see who their accuser
was and upon what specific
evidence he made his groundless
accusations, which were calcu-
lated to cause distress of mind
and fear to every wife who had
a husband or mother who had
a soa in Japan.
A few soldier members of the
House of Representatives should
make it their business to discover
why this course was not taken.
“By the Way you’ve rigged her you must have sailed
before the mast at Alice Springs.”
It might have saved a lot of
expense as well as suspense.
8.C.0.F. is important to
Commonwealth Defence since
it is the only cohesive and con-
tinuous-serving formation of
troops which the Commonwealth
possesses'. Its merits as a train-
ing-college for future officers and
as a laboratory for the Army are
considerable, and libel upon it
should not be taken lightly.
Communists in
Defence Projects.
While Mr. Attlee and other
Dominion leaders continue to
implement plans for internal
security in case of war with
Russia, the Commonwealth
“Government” continues to shirk
its duty.
Last week the Supply and
Development Bill was brought
down—a totalitarian measure
giving the Government enough
socialising powers even in peace-
time to enable it to establish
government by polit - bureau
and abandon Parliament alto-
gether. Its ostensible purpose, on
which Mr. Chifley laid much
stress, was to safeguard defence
projects. The powers which it
gives in this respect could be
taken by Government under the
Defence Act without the slightest
trouble. These powers are merely
a blind.
- When Mr. Fadden moved an
amendment to a clause to pro-
vide that “a person who is a
member of the Communist
party shall not be eligible for
engagement under the preced-
ing subsection” —which dealt
with the staff of the Department
—the Government, as usual,
dived for its hollow log.
Mr. Fadden said that there
were 60,000 temporary civil
servants who were not compelled
to take the oath of allegiance,
and a few of them were un-
doubtedly Communist and in a
position to obtain the most vital
defence secrets. Mr. Dedman
said that the Security Depart-
ment kept a complete check on
all Communists and knew where
they were.
If it does, it knows that a
man who was caught deliberately
red-anting civil defence in W.A.
and who was working for a body
which was communicating in
war-time with the Comintern,
then established in Vienna by
grace of Adolf Hitler, and circu-
lating abuse of the British on its
behalf, is employed in a scientific
department of the C.S.I.R. The
Security Department will also
know that Crown counsel
pointed at that man in the dock
and said: “Your Worship has
heard of the fifth-column. There
it is.” And it will, probably,
also have learnt that the depart-
ment in which the Comrade is
employed will become even more
important than it is now when
the R.A.A.F. turns over to jet
fighter-aircraft which are ply-
wood built.
Mr. Abbott during the debate
said that the secretary of the
Communist party in Lithgow
was employed in the Common-
wealth Small Arms factory.
Mr. Lang mentioned another
Communist whom he declared
to have been recently appointed
to the C.5.1.R., and queried
another man in the Prices
Branch.
Mr. Ryan, M.H.R. for
Flinders, on May 5, had asked
the Minister for Security, Dr.
Evatt, whether still another man,
who was alleged to have several
times publicly stressed his pride
in membership of the Commun-
ist party, was employed in No.
3 Drawing Office, Maribyrnong
munition works, as a book-
binder. * Dr. Evatt said he would
find out. If he is in an inquisi-
tive mood, he will find plenty of
others on the Government pay-
roll to inquire about.
It goes without saying that
the resolution was rejected on
a party vote. The Ironworkers,

Referendum will be the Communists, the
Black Marketeers and Chifley’s Canberra
power chasers.
The Communists will vote “Yes”, because
they favour dictatorship.
The Chifley people will vote “Yes”, be-
cause they favour centralised control, which
is a form of dictatorship.
The Black Marketeers will vote “Yes”,
because controls are essential to their un-
savoury existence.
These are the unholy trinity of “Yes-Men”
who will combine to fasten the fetters of
dictatorial control on the people of Australia.

Madness and Horror.
“Ek Dum”: The Palestine
position continues to be like a
Mad Hatter’s teaparty with the
guests weaving around each
other waving kettles of boiling
water.
The British are due to leave
on May 15, though this does not
mean that their troops will do so.
The only settlement which
seems possible is one affecting
Jerusalem, and that imposed
for the time being by force
by the British or one of
the combatants who happens to
have the local power to impose
it. The U.N.O. proposes to
appoint a neutral commissioner,
“acceptable to Arabs and Jews,”
to govern Jerusalem. Up to
May 10 no man could be found
to take the job.
The situation at the beginning
of the second week in May was
that the Jews had proudly
announced that they intended
to “set up the Jewish State”
under the Prime Ministership of
Mr. Ben Gurion so soon as the
British move out.
King Abdullah of Transjor-
dania is preparing to upset this
new Zionist entity the moment
it is created. He sums up his
policy in one succinct phrase:
“When the British go out, we
go in.”
There was plenty of earnest
that he was not talking idly.
In the north the Syrians
clamped down a news-censor-
ship and announced that within
a few days the restrictions would
be applied in all Arab countries.
Also in the north of the
Jewish State-to-be —which is in
three disjointed slices —Lebanese
heavy artillery was reported on
May 7 to be shelling a Jewish
settlement four miles from the
border. In another segment, near
Lydda, King Abdullah’s Arab
Legion was allegedly engaged
with results which varied con-
siderably according to the origin
of the communiques. Haganah
claimed that 20 Arab armored
cars had been destroyed.
The unfortunate British, try-
ing to do their best for each
lot of savages, were man-
handled by both sides, though
usually only accidentally by the
Arabs. The vicious terrorists of
the Stern Gang declare that they
have “redeclared war” on
Britain for daring to send more
troops into Palestine mainly
for the purpose of saving life.
On May 6 two trucks contain-
ing eight men went missing and
seven were killed and six
wounded. One of the truck
complements was afterwards
found dead —six men.
Jews are said to be importing
quantities of arms, also to be
preparing to import aircraft.
This would be impossible on a
large scale at present. But so
soon as the British grip is loosed
there will no doubt be a horrible
immigration of mercenaries
ready to earn money by killing
people in whom they have no
interest other than in the price
of murder.
One of the most horrible de-
velopments was the carrying of
the war into peaceful England
by Jewish terrorists when a
bomb was sent in a parcel to
the home of the parents of Cap-
tain Roy Farran, in Wolver-
hampton (England). Captain
Farran was tried and acquitted
in Palestine on a charge of hav-
ing murdered a young Jew
whose body was never found.
When the bomb—placed in a
hollowed-out cavity in a volume
of Shakspeare —was opened by
Captain Farran’s brother, who
was killed, the intended victim
was hundreds of miles aWay in
Scotland.
The memorial service was
strongly guarded. Yet England
of all countries has been the
most tolerant to Jews and the
most willing to give them sanc-
tuary and fight their causes. The
crime must have filled the whole
of British Jewry with horror.
Middle Eastern
Commands.
“Ek Dum”: Following the
decision to remove British troops
from Palestine there has been a
natural reorientation of com-
mands in the Middle East.
The organisation is a grim
commentary strategically on
what has happened in the last
year and is likely to happen
soon.
Field-Marshal Smuts, on
April 23, voiced the almost uni-
versal opinion in military circles
throughout the globe, from
which the only dissentients are
Messrs. Chifley, Evatt, Dedman,
etc., when he called on the South
Africans to “keep their armor
bright,” adding:
I am no warmonger, but we must
be prepared. It is no longer a case
of a small number of small nations
sparring; a powerful juggernaut is
on the move, and we want him to
know that he must either stop or
fight his way through 1 have no
doubt that with a spirit of unity we
shall win through.
This fits in closely with the
opinion of the Canadian Gov-
ernment, which has developed
this season’s military and naval
manoeuvres in the north because
there is only one possible
aggressor. • It also fits in with
the new Middle Eastern Com-
mand arrangements.
H.Q. Middle East will be at
Fayid in the Suez Canal Zone
and will manage policy and the
operational command. Two
administrative commands will
deal with the War Office direct.
Eastern Mediterranean com-
mand will include all land forces
in Greece, Egypt, Cyprus;, Malta
and North Africa, East Africa
will have a command area which
takes in everything from Somali-
land to the Zambesi. The
framework is one on which sub-
stantial organisation could be
built at a moment’s notice.
“Ek Dum”: Service members
of the Opposition held a meet-
ing at Parliament House last
week to protest against the in-
nuendos of the Prime Minister,
the Speaker and the Attorney-
General, Dr. Evatt, that the let-
ter which the Digger member
for the N.T., A. M. Plain, had
sent to Mr. Chifley the week
before asking for inquiries into
certain matters by a panel of
High Court Judges was the pro-
duct of an unbalanced or dis-.
ordered mind. Said the Digger
members:
We wish it known that Mr. Blain
has served in two wars and has
served in Parliament with ability and
vigor. He is as fully equipped as
any of his traducers and detractors
to serve further in a useful capacity.
And so he is. There is no
more vigorous worker for his
electorate and for returned sol-
diers in Parliament, as the
Ministers concerned know. It
would have been more con-
vincing had Mr. Rosevear speci-
fically denied that he had
charged Blain with using his
gold pass to get privileges from
the Japanese, and if Mr. Chifley
had granted an inquiry which,
in a day, could have cleared up
everything.

The United States Senate ap-
proved an Air Force —apart
from the Navy —consisting of
70 groups and 8000 aircraft and
420,000 men. The scheme in-
volves the immediate ordering
of 2727 bombers and jet-fighters.
The types are all post-war
models —some of them in the
third post-war version. Many
are already on order. Australia
has not eight—much less; 8000
—fighting aircraft of really up-
to-date vintage, though a few
Nene-equipped fighters are due
some time shortly.

WINES
PERSONAL ITEMS
One of the heroes of the Owen
Stanley Ranges, Frank Kingsley Norris,
D. 5.0., C.8.E., the Army’s new Director-
General of Medical Services, is a witty
speaker, a popular clubman and a great
friend of the Digger. Like Dr. A. E.
Coates, the Army’s new medical chief re-
ceives many a smile from former A.I.F.
men as he walks down Collins-street
from his rooms. They remember him
as the sharp-featured M.O. who made
the going easy when it was really tough.
Former Deputy-director of Medical Ser-
vices with the First Aust. Corps, he was
born at Lilydale and was educated at
Melbourne Grammar and Uni. He was
president of the Melbourne Medical
Society in 1933 and of the Medico-Legal
Society, 1938-39. He is representative of
the B.M.A. on the Victorian Society for
Crippled Children. Tennis, golf, bridge
and model shipbuilding are his recrea-
tions.
In closing a week of Catholic pageantry
with a Benediction, Archbishop Mannix
established a world record. He is only
the third archbishop Melbourne has had
since the first Catholic priest was con-
secrated 100 years ago as archbishop to
the diocese of Melbourne. The first was
Father James Goold, of Sydney. His
successor was Dr. Carr, whom Dr. Man-
nix succeeded on his death in , 1917. The
archbishop had his jubilee as a priest in
1937, but at his request there were no
celebrations. He is R.C. Chaplain-
General to the Australian forces and was
Vicar-Delegate to the U.S. Army during
the war.
Cardinal Spellman, who led the U.S.
delegation of 14 priests at the centenary
celebrations of the Roman Catholic
diocese of Melbourne, was given his hat
two years ago, at the same time as three
Empire prelates—Griffin, of Westminster,
Gilroy, of Sydney, and McGuigan, of
Toronto —were admitted to the College of
Cardinals. He has been Archbishop of
New York since 1939. Before that he
was for seven years Auxiliary Bishop of
Boston and spent a similar period in
Rome as Attache to the Secretary of
State’s office in the Vatican. Born at
Massachusetts, he’s 59.
Sir Clifford Paterson, 0.8. E., D.Sc.,
F.R.S., tall, white-haired and impeccably
tailored, is a graceful speaker as well as
a scientist. In a Sydney after-luncheon
talk he spoke of atom bombs, “Fido” —
fog-dispersal to laymen—“Pluto”—the
fuel-bearing cable-line under the Chan-
nel —radar and like scientific marvels,
and generally of the work done by
scientists in Britain in peace as >yell as
war. He made the point that research
must be carried out within industry as
well as by Governmental bodies, the ideal
being a balance. The day when specific
industries depended upon the work of
specific genius—as in the cases of Mar-
coni and Bell —had gone. On the subject
of “Fido,” he quoted Emerson’s remark
that man’s pressing need was someone
to tell him what he was capable of doing.
In this case the need was filled by
Churchill, who insisted that something
must be done to bridge the alternatives of
heavy casualties among bombers landing
on fog-choked airstrips or keeping them
grounded during foggy but strategically
vital periods. Paterson can fairly claim
to speak with authority. One of the
British team of scientists who did mighty
things during the war, he has a well-
rounded scientific background—founder
and director of General Electrical Com-
pany’s research laboratories, chairman of
at least half a dozen electrical and en-
gineering bodies, member, of the Ad-
visory Council of D.5.1.R., president of
the Institute of Electrical Engineers,
1930-31, and was Faraday Medallist in
1945.
First prize of £2OOO in the “Sydney
Morning Herald’s” novel competition goes
this year to a husband-and-wife team,
George and Charmian Johnston, for High
Valley, a story set in Tibet. Johnston was
a war-correspondent in New Guinea in
the early stages of the Pacific War and
later in China, Burma and Europe, He
went to U.S.A. with the Australian mis-
sion in 1943, travelled extensively in the
Americas, visited Persia, India, the Phil-
lipines and Japan, and in 1945 spent some
time in Tibet, where he gained the back-
ground for the prize novel. Johnston has
published seven books, mostly of war and
travel, but including one novel, Sky-
scrapers in the Mist. After the war he
became editor of the “Australasian Post”
and is at present on the staff of Sydney
“Sun.” Mrs. Johnston first began to write
when she edited a service journal for the
A.W.A.S. She has published short stories
and is working on a solo effort —a psycho-
logical thriller.
The “Herald” judges did not consider
any entry worthy of second prize this
year ; three third prizes of £3OO each were
awarded to H. C. Wells, F. B. Vickers and
Dal Stivens.
Former pilot with No, 86 Transport
Wing, which operated the Australia-Japan
air-courier service so successfully for two
years, Flight-Lieutenant R. C. Mac Kay,
D.F.C., has been given command of No.
22 City of Sydney Squadron, the N.S.W.
Citizen Air Force Fighter Squadron now
being formed at Bankstown. The new
job should be a rest, as since 1940 Mac-
Kay has flown continually; frequently
on difficult operations against the enemy.
After a period at Malta he went to the
Middle East and flew on shipping patrols
until the invasion of Southern France.
He operated also over the Adriatic and
Northern Italy, and after moving to
Gibraltar was on Atlantic patrols.
“Melbn”: The obsequies over the
Oriental Hotel in Collins-street, Mel-
bourne (B. 28/5/’4B) will have to be in-
definitely postponed, proprietor Tewks-
bury having, in response to protests from
all parts of Australia, changed his mind
with regard to selling it as a War Nurses’
memorial centre. Tewksbury has had a
lot of abuse levelled at him for his new
decision, but not from those who knew
his pleasant hostelry and the shortage of
such in Melbourne.
If Clarence McArthur, president of the
Adelaide Stock Exchange, ever appears
on ’Change without the buttonhole artis-
tically depicted here by Coventry, there
will probably be a panic of dimensions
unsurpassed since the Wall-street crash.
Informed observers in the vestibule aver
that his coat lapel has been florally decor-
ated every day since he first became a
member 33 years ago. For almost as
long a period he has been an executive of
the S.A. Football League —a State selec-
tor for 26 years, and Port Adelaide dele-
gate to the League for the same length
of time. For a stocks-and-shares man
he had a strange start in life —he was born
and spent his childhood on a lighthouse.
STOCK EXCHANGE PRESIDENT.
of which his father was the keeper. Back
in 1896, when he was 14, he took a job
as junior in a mining office and his jour-
ney to the presidency of the Stock Ex-
change began. Two of his three sons are
partners in his sharebroking business.
The somewhat beatific expression on
Heth’s version of the face of Llewellyn
Toyne, Agricultural Attache to the
American Embassy in Australia, isn’t the
reflected glow from his neckwear but
rather from the happy atmosphere of the
annual Shorthorn Society dinner in Syd-
ney, whereat Toyne was a guest. A
cattleman himself —he was “raised” in
Colorado and was farmer and rancher
before joining the U.S. public service—
he is persona grata among Australian
MAN FROM COLORADO.
cattlemen and loses no opportunity of
looking over our stock and the country
that raises them. His purpose is to main-
tain a liaison between Australian and
American agricultural interests, a job he
does so well that Australians are glad to
see him wherever he goes. A big man
with a hearty outlook on life, he is never-
theless a shrewd observer, and when he
speaks in public, as he is frequently called
upon to do, his words have as much good
meat in them as a top-quality round of
Shorthorn beef.
Retired from the S.A. Police Force after
39 years’ service, Detective-sergeant G. H.
Walters, deputy-chief of the C. 1.8. He
first donned police uniform in 1909,
had a longer record of service than any
man in the force, and helped to bring to
justice many desperate criminals.
The many Australians to whom Sanda-
kan will always be a hallowed spot should
be interested in the efforts of Mr. and
Mrs. V. H. Bentham, recently in Aus-
tralia, to raise funds for the restoration
of the shattered church of St. Michael
and All Angels, in Sandakan. Damaged
both by the enemy and by Allied bom-
bardment, the main fabric is more or less
intact, but repairs and renovations neces-
sary to restore the building will run into
something like £lO,OOO. The small white
community has already raised £lOOO, but
help from outside will be necessary if
the job is to be done. The Benthams
have been in Borneo for more than a
quarter of a century, including years
as compulsory guests of the Japs. Since
the end of the war they have brought
comfort to many Australian homes
through tracing the graves of A.I.F. lads
in Borneo.
Shell’s Australian g.-m., Eric Avery, is
a Lincolnshire man. Widely educated,
he started with history and law at Cam-
bridge in 1926, crossed to America for
economics at Princeton and finished up
at the Pekin College of Chinese studies
in 1934. Since then oil has been his
interest, and when oil and travel were
combined in an Australian appointment
he accepted at once. After service in
the Army, and a visit to England on
business in 1945, he returned to the
assistant-general-managership, becoming
g.m. in July last year. Now the bitumen-
refining plant at Clyde is producing, his
main interest is in Queensland, where
Shell is spending £1,000,000 on drilling
in the Rolleston area. About 30 scout-
bores are being drilled. Avery believes
that, technical aids notwithstanding, deep-
drilling is the only conclusive test. So
a bore will search two miles deep under
Queensland.
In 1919 Sinn Fein leader De Valera
was a hunted man in Dublin, living the
kind of life so graphically described in
The Informer. For months he had given
the British Army headaches, and had
found what he thought was a safe refuge
in a house with a highly respectable old
lady and her two daughters. He was an
astounded revolutionary when one day a
British soldier walked in and put the
handcuffs on him. The other day he met
a man in Melbourne who was able to
enlighten him over a matter that had
puzzled him for 30 years —how he came
to be arrested. The man is masseur W.
Carruthers, of the City Baths. “I didn’t
think anybody could find me,” De Valera
told Carruthers when he was introduced
to him the other day, “unless he searched
every house in Dublin.” “That’s what we
did,” said Carruthers, grinning. “And you
shouldn’t have locked that back gate.”
Carruthers was a sergeant in the South
Lancashire Regiment attached to Dublin
Castle when he was sworn to secrecy and
told to find Eamon de Valera, “You
were the politest gentleman I ever ran
in,” he told the Irish leader. Ex-captor
and ex-captive shook hands after a two-
hours conversation. A brother of Presi-
dent Cosgrave was another of Mr.
Carruthers’s successful targets.
“Balander”: A birthday and a death
reported in N.Q. “Register” should act as
a warning to young married women to be
careful about the kind of place in which
their husbands expect them to set up
homes. Mrs. Edmund Mann is about to
celebrate her 89th birthday and her 60th
wedding anniversary. She and her hus-
band came from chilly England and
settled in Townsville, later moving west
and finally settling in Charters Towers in
1895. He was a graduate of Oxford, she of
Cambridge, Last week The Towers
mourned the death of Mrs. Mary Jones
at 81, a Welsh woman who settled there
in ’94 and, with her late husband, helped
along the local musical interests. The
warning by this time should be obvious;
no young woman —or young man, for
that matter —should go to the terrible
climate of North Queensland and en-
dure the isolation resulting from being so
far from Sydney or Melbourne unless he
or she wishes to live to a grand old age.
Captain Frederick Robertson Parham,
D. 5.0., R.N., odds-on favorite for the
honor of commanding battleship Van-
guard on the Royal tour of Australia and
New Zealand next year, is as friendly,
charming and approachable as any officer
of the R.N. Married with one son —a
subaltern in the Territorial Army—he
joined the Navy in 1913, served in
H.M.S. Malaya in the First World War
and then in the Warspite and Nelson. His
first command was the destroyer Shikari
in 1937 ; he gained his captaincy two
years later. As commander of the cruiser
Belfast he took part in the destruction
of the Schamhorst off North Cape in
1943. He collected a D.S.O. for “gal-
lantry, skill, determination and undaunted
devotion to duty during the D-Day land-
ings.”
Into the Silence:
In Melbourne, at 59, Herman H. Krohn,
who, after his discharge on medical grounds
from the A.1.F., made a magnificent job of the
Australian Comforts Fund. He was honorary
administrator from 1941 until the surrender
and after. He was managing-director of Howe
and Co. and a successful racehorse-owner.
At 86, in Melbourne, Miss Mary Lilian
Irving, founder of Lauriston Girls’ School and
a leading Victorian educationist. She was a
daughter of Professor Irving, one-time classics
professor at the University of Melbourne.
In Melbourne, Ephraim Francis Alloid, hotel
proprietor and® breeder of Ayrshire cattle. At
his model stud-farm at Berwick he bred an
Ayrshire bull which won a championship at
last Sydney Show. He had been nominated
as president of the Ayrshire Society.
In Sydney, at 82, George Frederick Birks,
a member of William Lane’s New Australia
settlement. When the colony failed he returned
to Sydney and founded a firm of manufactur-
ing chemists. He was the first Australian to
become a director of Rotary and a world
vice-president of Rotary International.
In Sydney, at 63, Edgar William Herbert, a
pioneer of physical training in Australia. An
Adelaide man,' he was trained at the College
of Physical Education in Springfield, U.S.A.,
and he founded the institution which became
the basis of the Y.M.C.A. College of Leader-
ship Training. It was largely due to his efforts
that the N.S.W. Government introduced physical
training on modern lines.
At Christchurch (M.L.), at 72, L. G. D.
Acland, high-country sheepfarmer, whose book,
The Early Canterbury Runs, is full of valuable
historical matter. He served in the Boer War
and the Kaiser’s war, and collected an 0.8. E.
and was three times mentioned in dispatches.


WOMEN'S LETTERS
From Melbourne
Few famous visitors to this city could
have received at their civic receptions
ovations such as that accorded Helen
Keller. One woman reflected everybody’s
thoughts with her remark; “I felt when
I met her, here was a woman who truly
walked with God,” and there were few
dry eyes .when the. guest of honor finished
her reply to the Lord Mayor’s speech
of welcome, for here before their own
seeing eyes was evidence of the amazing
courage and fortitude of this sightless
woman who so patently leads a full and
joyous life in serving those who suffer
from the lack of sight, speech and hear-
ing. Moving and wonderful, also, is the
understanding between Helen Keller and
her friend, Polly Thompson, so apparent
as they moved with such ease of manner
among the guests.
Lady Connelly, Lady Mayoress, wore a
blue ensemble and a matching hat. Mrs.
T. Hollway was in navy, Mrs. L. Cole-
man’s black-chiffon-and-lace gown was
worn under a silver-fox cape. Mrs. R.
Josephs’s frock and osprey-trimmed
hat were green, her furs water-mole. Mrs.
A. E. Coates wore a black hat with her
black Persian-lamb coat.
For the annual ball held by St.
Catherine’s Old Girls’ Association at St.
Kilda Town Hall, red and gold leaves
mixed with white flowers and green
hydrangeas, plus the school colors of
gold, pale-blue and dark-blue, formed
the chief decorations. Kathleen Lascelles,
organiser of the ball, w'ore a gown of
deep-cream lace, the shoulders and motif
the skirt being of green moire ribbon
embroidered in gold. The bodice of Pat
Andrews’s gown was boned in to her
figure ; a deep frill of the material, old
rose-silk net, outlined the deep off-the-
shoulder neckline. June Richardson’s
frock was of white taffeta printed with
large pink roses, the skirt draped back to
a large bustle, the tight-fitting bodice
strapless. President of the Old Girls’ As-
sociation, Peggy Williamson, wore a soft-
pink lace gown ; Pat Alexander, one of
the ticket secretaries, chose one in mist-
blue crepe with a shirred bodice and slim-
fitting skirt. Mrs. M. Powell’s gown was
of azure-blue cloque. Mrs. John Harri-
son’s was of white chiffon cut on Grecian
lines. Her sister, Loris Nettleberg, was
in blue satin, patterned with pink flowers ;
the skirt very full, the bodice revealing
the shoulders. Diana Harrison’s navy-
and-white-checked seersucker was very
full as to skirt, the flounce at the hem-
line threaded with navy-velvet ribbon,
which was repeated in the puff sleeves.
Anne McCaughey’s pink self-embroidered
chiffon gown featured a cross-over bodice
and full skirt.
Opinions differ greatly over Thornton
Wilder’s “Skin of Our Teeth,” which had
a very bright premiere at the Princess.
It allows Lady Olivier to show another
facet in her diamond-like personality, but
the role is one which precludes the
gorgeous in clothes. But the audience
made up for this lack. Lady Dugan’s
slim-fitting gown of japonica-red crepe
with its draped bertha collar and diamond
clips was worn under a cocoa-brown fox
cape. With Sir Edmund and Lady
Herring was Mrs. Rupert Downes, whose
aqua-blue crepe dinner-gown was
trimmed with cyclamen sequins. Mrs.
Ken Myer’s lovely gown of black net
had a wide band of cream-lace let into
the bouffant skirt, similar lace trimming
the decollete bodice. Mrs. J. D. Linton,
who, with her husband, came from Gee-
long for the premiere, wore a ballerina
frock of black crepe. Also from Gee-
long was Mrs. David Baker, her deep-
wine-toned crepe frock worn with a mink
cape. Her daughter June’s frock was of
pastel-green embroidered organza. Mrs.
Garnet Carroll’s taffetas were deep olive-
green, her cape stole white-fox. Gold
sequins embellished Mrs. Dan Reddan’s
white cloque gown. Mrs. Victor Cornaga
wore a gown and jacket of powder-blue
crepe; daughter Margot’s white gown
was adorned with a wide black gold-
studded belt.
Announcement of the engagement of
pretty, petite Gloria, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. J. H. Mellody, of Elwood, to Rolfe
Bernard, only son of Mr. and ftfrs. A.
E. Smith, of Darling Point, Sydney, was
celebrated at a party given by Gloria’s
parents. Gloria is well known in theatri-
cal circles ; one of her best-known stage
characterisations was in the title role of
“Mrs. Moonlight,” and her portrayal of
Juliet is still remembered. On May 26
Gloria will appear at the National
Theatre in “Marion.” Engagement ring
of sapphires and diamonds is set in two
platinum bands.
Mrs. R. Graeme Orr has succeeded
Lady Chauvel as State Commissioner of
Girl Guides for Victoria. It is a popu-
lar appointment, for Mrs. Orr started as
a guide at the age of 11. Since those
days she has been a lieutenant of a
company at her old school, St.
Catherine’s, done guide-training at Fox-
lease in England, and on her return
started her own company at Moulamein.
Interest in Girl Guides is an inheritance
from her mother, Mrs. Leonard Lansell,
who was one of the first divisional Com-
missioners in Victoria and is still Com-
missioner for Northern Victoria.
At the Williamstown Club’s meeting
held at Moonee Valley, the tweed coat,
mostly long of hem and very full and
flared, was popular. Some had hoods
which were a frame for a pretty face as
well as serving to keep out the icy blasts.
Silver-fox trimmed the hem of one dressy
black coat. A lovely mink coat was worn
by Peggy Walsh with her brown frock
and small lime-velvet-edged, brown-
osprey-trimmed hat. Mrs, Ivan St.
Claire’s American Beauty linen frock and
small pink hat also had mink for setting.
Her daughter Zara was a winter sym-
phony in beech-brown jacket suit and
small upturned felt hat in the same toning.
Vivid contrast to the black coat worn
by Mrs. H. Hickenbotham were the
yellow gloves and yellow trimming on
her large upturned black-felt hat.
Mrs. Massey Burnside plunged on a
white raincoat and red fisherman’s cap.
Florence Reid tucked herself into a black-
angora coat with a smart hood and high-
lighted the ensemble with gold jewellery.
Mrs. Sam Wood teamed bright-yellow
raincoat, matching hat and shoes of
brown-and-beige suede. Mrs. J. Buchanan
wore a grey flannel tailored suit, the
skirt pleated all round, the jacket nipped-
in at the waist; her small hat was brown
and matched her accessories. Mrs. Stuart
Hancock’s beige camelhair coat was worn
with a green hat and floral scarf. Ivy
Parker’s powder-blue Duvetyn coat was
trimmed with amber buttons, her small
hat massed at one side with blue wings.
Mrs. W. H. Horsfall chose a three-piece
suit of grey tweed with a matching hat
trimmed with pheasant feathers. Mrs.
Alan Walters’s wool coat was cherry-red,
her small black hat coq-feather trimmed.
Owner of Hemlock, Mrs. E. E. McGrath,
covered her mist-blue frock with a dyed-
ermine coat; brown - velvet ribbons
trimmed her brown felt hat.
This Broothorn study captures some-
thing of the alertness and eager energy
that marked the services of Mrs. D. W.
Reddan when she was president of the
War Prisoners’ Patriotic Fund during the
war years. The Olde Dutch Coffee
House, which also she managed with a
staff of voluntary helpers, cleared in the
first year £6OOO profit. Other war work
which Mrs. Reddan encompassed were the
canteen of the R.A.A.F. Recruiting Depot
and the American Red Cross. Now, as
well as running a home, she finds time for
amateur theatricals. At present Mrs.
Reddan is playing the lead in “Tony
Draws a Horse,” at the Melbourne
Repertory Theatre. Slim, fair and with
large brown eyes, Mrs. Reddan is a
smart dresser.
Scores of Dick Linton’s friends came
to the party at which Evie Hayes and
members of the “Annie Get Your Gun”
cast were farewelled 1 . Dick’s mother,
Lady Linton, received the guests in a
scarlet wool jacket trimmed with royal-
blue sequins and a royal-blue pleated
evening skirt. Evie Hayes’s dinner-gown
was of royal-blue crepe with four silver
sequin birds winging their way across
one side of the bodice. Her mother was
in a black gown and silver-fox furs.
Mrs. Erl Grey wore a stunning gown of
orchid satin under her hip-length white-
ermine coat, and Mrs. Bob Parrish’s
pleated model of aqua-blue crepe had the
yoke of fine blue net outlined in blue
and silver sequins. Mrs. W. Scarff’s
pleated skirt of black crepe was allied to
a saxe-blue crepe jacket heavily en-
crusted with cyclamen sequins;- Mrs.
Keith Davies wore a beige fox coat over
her black gown. Iris Russell Clarke’s
black-lace ballerina frock featured the
off-the-shoulder neckline. Peggy Mollard,
Who weds Bill Day next Saturday at
St. John’s, Toorak, wore cream lace over
pink taffetas, the top of the bodice being
outlined with moonlight sequins.
From Sydney
America and Australia are one in their
commemoration of the Battle of the Coral
Sea. The month of May and the year
1942 are still vivid in the memory of both
lands. The great battle, which un •
doubtedly saved Australia from enemy in-
vasion, has given its name to an outsize
in balls for the past three years. The
Australian-American Association works
hard each year for the event. Decora-
tions have a South Seas flavor. There is
also something that explorers of old
missed out on. Those lads sang “Yo-ho-ho
and a bottle of rum.” How they could
have carolled if they had met a jungle-
juice bar such as is set up in the Troca-
dero for these functions!
The Anderson lady, untiring worker in
the Food for Britain campaign, was presi-
dent of the ball committee and dressed her
hostess of the evening act in attractive sea-
blue crepes glinting with gold embroider-
ies. There was all the charm of China in
the frock worn by the wife of that great
country’s Consul-General Woo. This was
made in the national style and was of
vellum satin embroidered in a peacock
design. Canadian Commissioner K. A.
Greene, his wife and daughter Patsy were
at the ball. Both the Navy and the Army
were represented. Among the night’s
well-dressed were the wives of Admiral
Farncomb and Admiral Moore. Mrs.
F. H. Berryman’s crepes were black,
graceful and shimjjpery with beads.
Writer Gladys Lister’s decorative corner,
complete with pool, shells, mermaids and
all, was much admired.
Kathleen Gorham is one of this city’s
clever ballet dancers. She made a great
hit in the Borovansky company, and
Sydney audiences learned to know her as
Ann Somers during the recent Rambert
season. Kathleen has now gone with
Madame Rambert’s ballet to Maoriland.

Mrs. J. O’Donnell, of Adelaide, who
has been in Sydney staying at the Aus-
tralia, flew back to her home town to pre-
pare a welcome party for the 20 touring
military cadets from Riverview College.
They, under the command of Captain L.
Skewes and Cadet-Lieut. Desmond Con-
nolly, will descend on Adelaide after a
short stay in Melbourne. After Adelaide
the lads fly to Perth, where the Governor
and Lady Mitchell will give a reception
for them at Government House.
Lord Mountevans (Evans of the Broke)
is a pocketbook-edition Admiral. He’s
not tall, and he’s not a heavyweight, but
he’s all dynamite and sudden death to
the enemy. If you want to know how
heroes look and talk, try to meet him. He
doesn’t tell of his own brave deeds; he
probably never gives them a thought. His
mother was a Dubliner, so, of course, he
has inherited charm of manner and the
easiest manner of talking in the world.
Lord Mountevans and his wife (he refers
to her sometimes as “my blonde” and
“Blondie”) were guests of honor at a lunch
given by George Sutton, Australian repre-
sentative of Hutchinson’s publishing com-
pany. There were about 70 guests, all
of whom, except perhaps the McMaster
lady and a handful at the top table, were
busied about the writing or the selling of
books.
And when at last it was time for the
speeches, what an inspired speech the
little Admiral gave! He told not of sea-
battles but of the ordinary everyday
people of London and how they defied
the fury of Hitler’s bombing by going
about their work and sometimes play in
the way they had always been used to
doing. How they blunted the bitter edge
of “incidents” by the scorn of Cockney
laughter. In short, how British they
were! If ever Lord Mountevans writes
a book he must tell in it again the story
of Miss Weir, of Chelsea —Miss Weir,
the little ambulance girl, her tin-hat
jammed over her bright hair, who went
on rescuing the sick from a bombed hos-
pital, though word had been brought to
her that her own home had been bombed
to the ground, and destroyed with it her
father and mother and sweetheart.
Lady Mountevans wore black and
sleek furs and carried red roses. The
McMaster lady, who had come down
from Cassilis with the Admiral and his
wife, who had been guests at Dalkeith,
the McMaster home, wore Persian-red
crepes, and also had a posy given to her.
Mrs. George Sutton was in red with
smart black millinery ; and Hutchinson
authoress June Wright, up from Mel-
bourne, wore beige pinks, a small hat and
a pleased smile.
Australia at work or at play rides on
the sheep’s back all right. Still another
dance to be held during sheep-show and
ram-sales week is that of the King’s Old
Boys’ Union. The date is June 3, the
place the Trocadero. The committee
promises an irresistible orchestra, lots of
fun and a good supper. Dancing com-
mences at nine and goes on till one in
the morning. The War Memorial Fund
benefits.
By the time you are reading this about
1200 people who danced last night away
at the Actors’ Ball will be drinking
large cups of tea, hqt and strong. Judg-
ing by the set-up just as this Letter was
going to press the ball was one of the
gayest that has brightened the Troca-
dero. Not only were the tables' scattered
with stars, but radio and stage actress
Nellie Lamport was handing out stars
large and small to arriving guests. Fine
black Maltese lace which had belonged
to her grandmother, through which
gleamed pink brocade, made Nellie’s
frock.
Actress June Clyde, coming on
after “Born Yesterday,” the show at the
Royal, was wearing cocoa-brown crepes
crusted with gold sequins. Her tiny shoes
and handbag were gold, and her even-
ing wrap was a stole of sable. Mrs.
Stanleigh , Scott’s turquoise-blue crepes
had a classically-draped skirt, and half
the skirt and one sleeve were gold-
studded. But the kid belt, a special pre-
sent from her husband, was perhaps the
highlight, the kid foundation coated with
18-carat gold. Neva Carr Glyn an-
nounced her choice for the night as shell-
pink crepes, gracefully draped. With this
she wore a set of silver ornaments —
genuine Nautch dancer’s adornments.
Therese Desmond and husband Ed
Howell were to lead one of the night’s
two barn-dances. A group of Eureka
Stockaders, Jane Barrett among them,
had booked a table. Michele Bernardini,
of wfiite Arctic-fox fame, from the Tivoli,
was coming after the show. Bob Parrish
in song and Koba and Kalee in their
famed balancing and dancing act were
other attractions on a full bill.
Victoria Leaguers turned out in force
to welcome Lord Mountevans last Fri-
day afternoon. The Admiral, the aura
of his Antarctic fame still about him,
and the more recent renown he won as
Regional Commissioner for the Defence
of London in his listeners’ memory, gave
one of his stirring talks. There was a
tea-drinking later which enabled friends
he had made when he was in command
of the Australian Navy, 1929-31, to re-
new their acquaintance.
Town and country were in the pews at
St. Mark’s for the wedding of Moira
Finlay and Wallace Munro. Moira is a
daughter of the Dr. Cuthbert Finlay
couple, of Marrickville, and the ’groom’s
parents are the Roley Munros, of Moree.
Reception for 200 guests at the Royal
Sydney Golf Club.
There’s no doubt the Country Women’s
Association is the salt of this earth we
call Australia. Take these two notices
alone on the agenda-paper which came
under discussion at the C.W.A. annual
conference held last week in the Assembly
Hall:
That the Government be asked to speed
up the production of egg-powder in Aus-
tralia and so assist Britain’s acute food
shortage.
That C.W.A. country members try to
take children from city orphanages for a
holiday in the country.
There are kindness and generous im-
pulse behind each of those motions.
And the C.W.A. is intensely prac-
tical, too, at their pow-wows. Eco-
nomics, health, transport, education are
viewed with an eye not only to the bene-
fit of the outback dweller but to the
general good. There were 800 at the
opening of the conference, and there
would have been more only many of the
delegates were kept away through flood
conditions. Four former State presidents
were at the opening session: Mrs. A. .1.
Studdy, Mrs. Mac Smith, Mrs. J. W. C.
Beveridge, and Mrs. J. J. Garry. Mrs.
Northcott, who was present, made grace-
ful reference to the C.W.A. hospitality
shown to the Governor and daughter.
Elizabeth during their country tour. Mrs.
G L. Brooks was re-elected State president.

This, the best profit to date, is still un-
representative of Australian Iron and
Steel’s capacity. With our whole economy
calling for more steel, the industry has to
proceed at two-thirds pace through lack
of coal and manpower—one of the two
A. and S. blast furnaces, for instance,
has been closed down since July, 1946.
Under that abnormal burden of over-
head last year’s £418,570 profit was quite
respectable. After paying the prefs. it
represented 7.3 p.c. on ordinary capital;
but with big developments afoot, 8.H.P.,
the sole ordinary shareholder, has been
content to pass the dividend. Large ex-
penses are already being incurred on the
tinplate mill and hot and cold strip mills
which will take some years to establish
at the A.I, and S. works at Port Kembla
(N.S.W.).
This project will be a bolder and costlier
affair than that envisaged before the war,
when local requirements called for 60,000
tons of tinplate a year. Tinplate is
really steel plate with a fine tin coating,
and the steel undergoes two main pro-
cesses before the coat is applied: first,
red-hot bars are passed through rollers
which reduce its thickness in stages ; then
the steel is cooled and cold-rolled for
further reduction, if necessary, and to
give a smooth surface. After annealing
and cleaning it is ready to be dipped in
molten tin, then to be passed through a
third set of rollers which evens the coat-
ing.
Not only has Australia’s consumption
of tinplate doubled since 1939, bujt in-
dustrial steels are being sought increas-
ingly in the flat-rolled condition. To
meet both demands, the hot-rolling mill
at Port Kembla is designed to process
over a million tons of ingots a year, turn-
ing out strip steel up to 60in. wide and
down to a twentieth of an inch thick.
The cold rollers are to have a smaller
capacity, being mainly used for tinplate ;
but in conjunction with the tinning plant
they will probably be able to supply at
least the full local demand. Any surplus
should find a ready market abroad whilst
B. retains its present cost advantage
over British and U.S. steels. But the
production stage for tinplate is probably
several years off.
Ever since B.ELP, rapped its baton at
Port Kembla in 1935 (having issued
750,000 of its own £1 shares as full pay-
ment for the AJL and S. ordinary capital
of £2,700,007), the theme has been rapid,
efficient expansion. Characteristically,
one of the first steps was to introduce 72
coke-ovens for by-products treatment. By
1940 the Bulli and Mt. Keira collieries
had been bought, electrified and given
extra rail facilities; two modem blast-
furnaces had been installed at Kembla; —
each with a capacity of 1000 tons of pig-
iron daily—besides six open-hearth steel
furnaces, electrical plant, boilers and pro-
cessing mills. Since the war another
colliery, the Mt. Kembla, has been bought
for £150,000.
The introductory profit table, covering
the whole B.H.P. regime, brings out that
co.’s abstemious policy during the develop-
ment of A.I. and S.; one 5 p.c.
ordinary div, has been taken in 12 years.
Over that period the omnibus balance-
sheet entry for fixed assets has risen by
£3,526,792 (or 92 p.c.):

Last year’s heavy expenditure of
£2,052,680 on fixed assets (after writing-
off £874,573 to depreciation the net addi-
tion is shown at £1,178,107) not only in-
cludes outlays on the strip mills but on
colliery mechanisation, a new adit at Mt.
Nebo, 48 additional by-product coke-
ovens at Port Kembla and development
of the Yampi Sound (W.A.) iron deposits.
In association with B.H.P. a £4 million
programme has been drawn up for mine
mechanisation —the only answer to coal
and labor shortages, which would be in-
tensified when the strip mills have doubled
the ingot capacity at Kembla. Meeting
last term’s expansion, the co. practically
exhausted its cash holdings, but retained
the £896,282 invested in Government
bonds; creditors, including 8.H.P., pro-
vided an extra £801,746,
So far there has been no official lead
as to when or how the millions of pounds
needed for the 8.H.P.-A.I. and S. projects
will be raised. Direct public holdings in
A.I. and S. are confined to the 1,000,000
1\ p.c. cumulative prefs., which have net
asset backing of £7 10s. 6d. and yield 4
p.c. at the current price of 375.; at the
annual meeting last month chairman H.
G, Darling told an inquirer he could not
promise at that# stage that pref,-
holders would be invited to subscribe any
new capital. It seems certain that holders
of B.H.P. scrip will eventually be asked to
contribute ; the present price of 595. each
for this co.’s 13,885,012 £1 ords. offers
a 2.8 p.c. yield on the basis of this year's
8.3 p.c. dividend. That is how the mar-
ket sums up the probable scale of new
issues, the premiums likely to be required
by the board or the Treasury and the
future earning ability of this enterprising
Vulcan.

From vinegrower to barman, all sec-
tions of the wine trade are riding a
wave of prosperity. Three good vintages
in succession have been sold at excellent
prices by the growers, some of whom
have reduced their customary deliveries
of grapes to the dried-fruit industry for
the quicker returns to be got from
wineries. At the distributing end a
gratifying, if belated, public recognition
of the quality of local wines has been
met since the war, and in N- S. Wales
unfortified types may now be served in
approved restaurants. The export trade
is likewise booming, helped by Britain’s
recent increase of the preferential margin
on Dominion table wines. Only an in-
sufficiency of bottles, casks and shipping
stands in the way of turnover still higher
than the present record.
It is not inconceivable, however, that
without co-ordination and foresight
the industry might relapse into that
state of chronic over-supply which caused
cut-throat competition and unprofitable
trading during the thirties. Adapting sup-
plies to demand is a complex affair when
an interval Of years must elapse between
vine-laying and retail sales. The full
effect of the recent good seasons has yet
to be felt at the retailing end; much of
this produce is refilling the “pipelines”
of the industry—building up reserve
stocks that were depleted by drought and
war restrictions. The balance will cer-
tainly find a ready market, but continued
expansion by growers at this point could
ultimately bring disappointment. Organ-
ised market research, already being
carried out within the industry, is an
essential safeguard.
Practically the only wine representative
on the list of Australian public cos., the
Caldwell business embraces most sec-
tions of the trade. Some quality wines
are grown in the co.’s own Corowa
(N.S.W.) vineyards, but the bulk of its
tonnage comes from growers in the
vicinity of its new winery at Yenda; in
future this plant will process most of
the co-.’s product. At Camperdown
(Sydney) are the bulk cellars and whole-
sale department, besides which Caldwell’s
owns a chain of metropolitan saloons.
In recent years the co.’s scrip has risen
sharply in the market’s estimation not
only because of the better general out-
look for the trade, but for the way in
which the board has prepared for an ex-
panding market. Reserve stocks were
steadily increased in the difficult war
period, and the Yenda winery and distil-
lery, which will allow a substantial cut in
costs, was begun in 1946. The £30,000
for this project was met internally, thanks
to a prudent dividend policy which has
improved the financial structure consider-
ably since 1939:

“Special financing of some £50,000 by
June 30, 1948,” will be necessary, says
the chairman, so that the Yenda winery
can pay growers for their vintage. Previ-
ously the grapes were processed by out-
side wineries which took payment over
the year in instalments. There has been
no indication so far that the special
financing will entail a new capital issue.
Last year’s profit, the best since Cald-
well’s was officially listed in 1921, repre-
sented 23.9 p.c. on ordinary capital after
paying the prefs., compared with 13.2
p.c. in 1946. Tax provision was £20,000
in both years, with depreciation £llOB
higher this time at £2551 ; general ex-
penses amounted to 36.2 p.c.- of gross
revenue, compared with 46.7 p.c. in 1946.
Both turnover and profit will possibly
improve further this year. The experi-
enced board can be expected to take full
advantage of the industry’s improved
status, and to remain alert for future
trends. The co.’s £1 ords., procurable at
less than ss. in 1939, are quoted around
275. 6d. Yield at that figure is
4-4 p.c. on the basis of last year’s div.,
and the shares have net tangible cover
of 275.

The latest Peters accounts suggest that
Brisbane’s high war-time turnover in
ice-cream is being generally maintained.
That is remarkable not only in view of the
ebb-tide of servicemen from Queensland
after 1945, but also because of supply
difficulties which must have followed the
dry 1946 season. Indeed, the co.’s result
contrasts with that of its North Queens-
land associate, whose latest disclosed
profit is the smallest in five years.
The 20-year-old Brisbane co. has built
up formidable financial strength largely
by its prudent policy in regard to profit-
declarations and dividends. Depreciation
has been very generously provided for—
last year’s allowance being £22,000 (up
£4500) —whilst a rather enigmatic item in
the balance-sheet, “tax and contingencies
provision,” has grown to considerable size,
though drawn upon without comment for
£60,901 last term;

As £123,956 of cash balances is labelled
“tax-provision fund,” at least the balance
of £50,000 in “tax and contingencies”
may be regarded as reserves. Yearly tax
allocations aren’t disclosed, but the re-
moval of War-time (Co.) Tax last year
was not allowed for in the disclosed
profit of £31,521. That figure represented
17.5 p.c. on capital, compared with 17.3,
16.9, 19.1 and 13.9 p.c. back to 1943.
Details of the £63,332 gross expenditure
on fixed assets last term (subject to the
£22,000 written off) are not included in
the directors’ report. The co. can obvi-
ously make further additions of this
nature without straining its finances.

paid and another 130,000 paid to 15s.

the yield would be p.c, on the basis
of the 10 p.c. dividend.

The board offers no comment on the
jump in last year’s earnings, which may
be due in part to heavy sales of fefrigera-
tors, vacuum-cleaners and radios —meet-
ing a post-war demand that will be largely
non-recurring. But the co.’s basic retail
business in musical goods was no doubt
partly responsible, as a sellers’ market
exists for most lines. Looking back now
it can be seen that the arrival of wireless
and sound-films in the ’twenties, which
seemed catastrophic for musical-dealers
like Palings, has finally produced a con-
trary result. Wireless, especially, has
contributed to the wider musical taste of
the public, which is now testified by keen
attendances at celebrity recitals, large
enrolments for musical training and an
unprecedented demand for recordings,
pianos and other instruments. Palings has

Pelmanism
Scientific Training of Mind ,
Memory and Personality
APTITUDE AND EXPRESSION
PELMANISM is a means by which know-
ledge is more easily acquired, retained
and used, a means through which natural
aptitudes find greater expression. The
emphasis is all the time on use, for with
practice and use more knowledge comes,
and skill, wisdom and power grow.
Full and frequent attention is given to
our relations with other people and our
adjustment to environment. As the
reports asked for on each lesson, and the
Institute’s comments thereon, are con-
cerned with the pupil’s own life and cir-
cumstances his interest is continuous, and
he gets pleasure as well as profit from
the training.
The exercises give smoothness and a
sense of easy accomplishment to the daily
round. The general effect of the training
is to induce an attitude of mind and a
personal efficiency favourable to the
happy management of life.
APPROVAL.
The Pelman Course is approved by the War Office, London,

responded to the better atmos-
phere by developing its overseas
sources of supply and by enter-
ing the field of piano-making on
its own account
When the investing public
first became interested in this
co. in 1934 it had not fully re-
covered from the depression,
which had dislocated its large
time-payment business, or from
the initial impact of radio and
talkies on “live” music. Com-
petition was keen in the ’thirties,
and Palings undertook an ex-
tensive overhaul of business
methods, which was completed
in 1940. By that time war was
cutting off overseas musical sup-
plies as well as local production
of refrigerators and vacuum-
cleaners. Half-dormant business
conditions left the co. temper-
arily over-capitalised, with large
cash balances. Last term’s re-
viving turnover caused cash to
be drawn upon for £64,787 to
help meet increases in stocks
(£48,913) and debtors (£75,773),
but the liquid position is still
very strong:

The 97 p.c. lift in debtors’ bal-
ances is mainly due to a rise of
£45,569 in time-payment ac-
counts, which now stand at
£115,761 ; the doubtful-debts re-
serve is £18,243.
Last term’s profit was £28,147
better than in 1946, and repre-
sented 16.3 p.c, on capital. The
is hopeful of better sup-
plies in some lines this term, but
offers no opinion on the general
prospect. Considerable attention
is being given to refrigeration
sales in Queensland, where the
co. now has three branches
(Brisbane, Townsville and
Cairns).
The current price of 325. 6d.
for the co.’s 18s. shares offers
a yield of 5.6 p.c. on the basis of
last year’s 2s. (9,1 p.c.) dividend.
On book values the shares have
net tangible backing of 325.
Westralian goldmining in-
dustry has received another
blow in the 3s. sd. a week basic-
wage increase, which will add
about £30,000 a year to the
wages bill. With the rise given
earlier in the year, mineowners
are now paying an additional
£50,000 to their employees for
basic-wage adjustments. Because
of gold’s fixed price, neither these
increases nor the higher costs of
general supplies can be passed

From London: Ora Banda
United Mines, Ltd., operating on
the Ora Banda field (W.A.), has
issued annual accounts which it
states are “familiar and similar
to the previous year.” Including
a Government advance of
£15,000, co. has spent £llO,OOO
in development and £30,000 in
buildings and plant in the last
12 years, and now wants an ad-
ditional £40,000 to reach the pro-
duction stage. Management
claims that there are 514,000 tons
of ore in sight and that
a new cheap treatment process
which eliminates flotation and
cyanidation and extracts the
gold in one operation has been
tested with encouraging results.
Co. has been granted a further
three months’ exemption from
labor conditions.

SUNRY SHOWS
"THE SKIN OF OUR
TEETH."
Laurence Olivier’s latest offer-
ing, by Thornton Wilder, is a
mad thing, though with method
in its madness.
The Antrobus family, of
Atlantic City, U.S., epitomises
mankind perpetually decaying
and perpetually renewing itself,
and then getting into the same
old rut and going off on another
cycle. First it is threatened by
an Ice Age, then by a deluge and
then by a great war. When the
Ice Age descends on Atlantic
City mammoths, dinosauri,
philosophers and poets shelter at
Mr. Antrobus’s fireside, which
is kept going by furniture thrown
up from the auditorium of the
Princess Theatre. In the deluge
Antrobus takes two each of all
the queer mammals, animal and
human, into an ark; and after
the war he finds himself back
in the bosom of bis! family faced
with the same old problems of
how to live together.
If Mr, Wilder means anything
by his complicated picture it is
that life is an individual prob-
lem. Mass movements don’t
solve anything. Whatever side
he was on in the war and who-
ever won, Antrobus still has the
wife he has grown tired of but
feels guilty about leaving, a
daughter who is extraordinarily
like her mother and a delinquent
son with a grouch against the
world and an appetite for mur-
der. Without seeing any way
out of the circle of fire with
which he is) surrounded, Mr.
Antrobus starts on another
cycle.
Pespite the welter of Mr.
Wilder’s insane inventions, which
range from brass-bands and
newsreels, beauty contests and
backchat between audience and
actors, he succeeds! in making a
picture that lives in its own way,
and Laurence Olivier’s consum-
mate acting makes of Antrobus a
sympathetic figure. Vivien Leigh
changes her character and her
clothes, or leaves most of them
off, as a bathing beauty, and
shows a hitherto unsuspected
comedic talent as a housemaid.
The rest of the cast couldn’t be
distinguished in the’ breathless
business, and there were times
when nobody would have cared
much if the whole lot had gone
up in a general conflagration,
F. S.
"Night Must Fall."
Dr, Raoul Cardamatis’s pro-
duction of “Night Must Fall”
at the Independent Theatre,
North Sydney, probed more
deeply into the psychological
aspect than do piost presenta-
tions of the Emlyn Williams
drama. The doctor believes that
we all are egoists, differing only
in degree. When egoism, frus-
trated and repressed, mounts to
a paranoical urge to attract
attention by murder, the crime
could be judged not on our
social law of a life for a life but
in the light of the mental disease
that forces its committing.
The producer, however, rea-
lises the necessity for repressive
laws for society’s protection,
and opens the play with a Judge
of the Appeal Court refusing
the murderer’s appeal. This was
done so effectively that, there-
after, the audience was torn be-
tween respect for established law
and sympathy for the mentally-
ill Danny, sensitively played by
John Qraig.
As a page-boy without money,
position or the respect of people
he serves, and driven by the urge
for limelight, Craig played the
paranoic with promising skill.
Murders regardless', you felt
sympathy for Danny. You felt,
as Olivia Grayne (Betty Vidal)
discovered at the end, that men-
tally he was a baby, with a
child’s delight in being clever,
outwitting its elders and revel-
ling in the spotlight. His sud-
den fright when the handcuffs
were on and his return to
childish delight with the inspec-
tor’s grim reference to the
crowds that would gather to see
him were excellent acting.
Patty Griffith’s Mrs. Bram-
son, the murdered aunt, was a
good psychological study and
cleverly acted, though she ac-
cepted Danny a trifle too trust-
fully ; Kevin Bowden was a
sufficiently vacuous Hubert;
Pauline Beaumont made Danny’s
defection understandable, and
Desmonde Downing, as Mrs.
Terence, got most of the laughs
in the play’s lighter moments.
Tivoli.
Sydney Tivoli’s current bill is
fast and funny, dirty and tune-
ful and generously decorated
with excellent examples of the
almost-unclad female form. And
that is exactly what good vaude-
ville should be.
The speed is provided by such
people as Koba and Kalee in
some agile stunting and balanc-
ing ; by the Schaller Brothers’
gymnastics! on a “trampoline” ;
by “Les Trois Rapidos” in an
Apache dance that looks almost
as dinkum as a Surry Hills
brawl; by juggler George Hurd,
who nonchalantly does amazing
things with billiard-cues, tubs,
chairs, brooms and other im-
pedimenta ; and by the excellent
musical clowns Noni, Nita and
Dody.
The humor, etc,, comes; mainly
from Australian Terry Scanlon,
an infectious comedian who, if
he goes on improving in the pre-
sent direction, will eventually
belong to the same tradition as
“Mo,” George Wallace and
others. When Scanlon isn’t oc-
cupying the limelight the humor-
ous portion of the night’s enter-
tainment is dished up by the ex-
überant Jenny Howard, by
Murray and Hobbs and by the
dry, droll Cliff Cook.
The tunefulness is provided
mainly by baritone Bob Parrish ;
the female form is exhibited by
Micheline Bemardini, from
Paris, and by the Tiv.’s own
lovelies, and there is no visual
evidence that they mould ’em
any better in France than they
do in these parts.
At the Films.
“So Well Remembered” (Syd-
ney Esquire): James Hilton’s
novel about a wicked, wicked
woman who marries a sincere
young radical and leaves him
when his honesty of purpose
clashes with her social ambi-
tions. The young man goesi
steadily and honestly upward to
become mayor of the dingy mill
town, to which the woman
eventually returns as proprietor
of one of the mills. By this time
she is a widow selfishly devoted
to her only son and determined
that he shall not marry the girl
he chooses. The mayor sees
that he does. The woman is
overdrawn and vehemently over-
played by Martha Scott, but
John Mills’s performance as the
young radical growing to the
cautious, honest councillor and
mayor is a model of excellent,
intelligent acting. Trevor Howard
as the doctor driven to drink by
the misery and suffering of the
town also turns in a fine per-
formance.

“Fun and Fancy Free” (Syd-
ney Mayfair): Disney’s latest
full-length effort is taken up with
a sentimental cartoon about a
circus bear who returns to the
perils of the wild ; and a Holly-
wood version of Jack and the
Beanstalk, narrated by ventrilo-
quist Edgar Bergen and his)
dummies, and “acted” by
Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse
and Goofy, the miserable
hound. Funny in spots, clever in
others, but a long way behind
the best of Disney.

Franchot Tone, in “I Love
Trouble,” at Sydney Victory,
finds himself in a maze that
makes Clapham Junction seem
like a billiard-table. Five women,
vogue outside and vague inside,
clutter up the story of a private
detective with unlimited funds
who is shadowing a girl who
most of the time is tailing him.
Tone solves whatever there is to
solve, which puts him in a class
above the audience.
Eileen Joyce.
Appearing with the Sydney
Symphony Orchestra under the
baton of Bernard Heinze, Eileen
Joyce gave to Beethoven’s
Fourth Concerto all the delicate
artistry one has come to expect
of her. This was particularly
notable in the long cadenza
which closes the allegro, the
gentle responses in the andante
to the blusterings of the
orchestra, and the rondo, in
which the fingerising at top
pace was brilliant. But the
final two concert! of the Master
of Bonn call for much more
than delicate artistry. The gusty
humor of the last movement of
the Fourth cries out for power
and virility and sonorities which
no woman’s fingers have yet
been able to conjure.
The concerto was sandwiched
between Weiner’s richly-scored
transcription of the Bach Toc-
cata, Adagio and Fugue in C
Major, dts omateness gaining
emphasis from the splendid work
of the strings in the full-blooded
vigor of the Fugue, one of the
finest examples of organ music
extant, and Shostakovitch’s
Fifth Symphony. This work by
the Soviet composer gets better
with closer acquaintance. There
is certainly vulgarity in parts of
the opening and closing move-
ments, with overemphasis on the
brass section, but the largo has
passages of rare beauty, if at
times it seems exaggeratedly
slow.
Miss Joyce’s Sydney pro-
grammes were obviously
selected to make the
widest possible appeal to the
man or woman who likes
those classical works which are
deservedly popular and which
have a maximum of melody and
a minimum of heaviness and ob-
scurity.
The pianist is at her best —and
a very good best —in Chopin,
and this she demonstrated at her
first recital —after an exquisite
rendering of the Schubert Im-
promptu in B Flat —in the
Second Sonata. The tripping
measures in the allegro were
clean-cut, the upsurge towards
the end of the movement a fine
burst of lyrical playing. Omin-
ousness was inherent in the
scherzo, with the dread chords
alternating between the two
hands, and the canta b i 1 e
haunting and insistent. The
threnody of the third move-
ment was saturated in
death. Fler building -up of

When Sister Sue found her tube of Napro Hair
Vitalizer squeezed dry, she just took one look at brother
Bob’s lustrous, healthy hair and picked the culprit.
For Bob, like many other men, had found that Napro
Hair Vitalizer gave him a healthy scalp, removed
dandruff and made his hair elastic and vigorous. But
he’s got no excuse for "borrowing” it again, because
now there is a special Napro Hair Vitalizer for men
that has all the qualities of the original product and,
at the same time, keeps the hair perfectly groomed
without "plastering.” So just slip into any good chemist
or store and buy a tube to-day—it will improve your
hair from the very first application.

Stephen Hales, vicar of Teddington in Middlesex,
made the important discovery that plants absorb part of their
food from the air. Hales invented artificial ventilators and
numerous other mechanical contrivances as well as studying
animal and plant physiology. From this, he turned his
attention to chemistry, and in his.principal book, “Vegetable
Staticks,” published in 1727, he stressed the importance of
accurate weighing and measuring in chemical operations.
Unfortunately, his quickness to see the need for accurate
measurement restricted his vision in other directions. Having
observed that plants breathe in large quantities of air, he
concluded that this air could be recovered, and proceeded to
distil, in a gun barrel, a great number of miscellaneous sub-
stances, including tallow, hog’s blood, peas, oyster shells,
tobacco, a fallow deer’s hom, camphor, beeswax and honey.
He collected the gases he obtained and made accurate calcula-
tions to show the proportion they bore by weight to the
original substances. There is no doubt that Hales unwittingly
prepared crude samples of many important chemicals, but he
was so engrossed in weighing and measuring, at the expense
of accurately observing the substances under experiment,
that he failed entirely to appreciate the
significance of much of his own work. He
dismissed the various gases he had prepared
as "air.” He died in 1761. and was honoured
by being buried in Westminster Abbey.

With Brisbane race-clubs putting
up whacking prizes to lure southern
horses north for the winter, and the
southern clubs countering with tidy
inducements for them to remain at
home, the once off-season winter
racing has become extra-well endowed
and far more interesting than in pre-
war days. On Saturday, in addition
to normal meetings in Melbourne
(Moonee Valley) and Sydney (Tatter-
sail’s Club at Randwick), there were
run in S.A. the Goodwood Handi-
cap, in N.S.W. the Newcastle Cup
and in Queensland the Brisbane Cup.
Despite its still superior prize-
money, Brisbane gives signs of losing
the grip it promised to obtain on the
potentially rich field of winter rac-
ing, It was noticeable that this year’s
Stradbroke Handicap-Brisbane Cup
meeting drew only a small and com-
paratively poor bunch of visitors, with
Dark Marne the only class galloper
to make the trip, if the Queensland-
owned Murray Stream is left out of
reckoning.
All the same the crowds saw some
fine sport when the weather broke.
The Stradbroke, run on a sodden
track, went to Ballyvista (7.2), beat-
ing Stands Alone (7.7) and Radstock
(7.2). In the Brisbane Cup the six-
year-old Fresco mare Sicarda (7.10)
led all the way, beautifully ridden by
Peter Morgan, to down Dark Marne
(9st.) and Fly Bird (7st.).
* * * *
Queensland was represented by
another pot-winner at Newcastle, the
Cup being won by Black Pearl (R.
Pritchard) with Tilston and Barnsley
in the places. A four-year-old Scin-
tillation mare, Black Pearl was well-
performed in Brisbane, but, brought
to Sydney some months back, she
had had several runs without success,
at distances evidently too short for
her. The 11-furlongs Newcastle Cup
gave the mare her first chance at a
suitable distance.

Melbourne owner O. R. Porter took
some of his string over to Adelaide
for the Morphettville meeting, and
more than collected expenses. In
the £l5OO Goodwood Handicap
Porter’s Denhoti was squeezed out
at the start, but recovered his ground
and finished splendidly to down the
hot favorite Comedy Prince and Belle
Star, Denhoti knocked out the six
furlongs in the smart time of 1.12;
the track was soft and the course
record for the trip is 1.1 H, credited
to Aurie’s Star. Porter was also
partly successful with Chatspa, who
deadheated with Typical in the Fisher
Handicap; Stenelaus, another of
Porter’s, paid his share by collecting
third money in the same race.
* r * * *
At Randwick punters fell for some-
thing which they should have had
clearly labelled among past experi-
ences—that of the leading jockey who
sacrifices a potentially good mount in
a rich race elsewhere, in order to
stay home and ride at the local meet-
ing. The assumption then is that
whatever he rides at the local must
be the goods. J. Thompson, who
could have ridden Dark Marne in
Brisbane, was the unwitting culprit,
the mob coming a deafening thud
over his Randwick mounts. Thompson
had mounts in all seven races; four
of them started favorite, one was a
second favorite, the other two heavily
backed and he didn’t ride a winner.
The most notable feature otherwise
of Randwick racing was the success
in the principal events of two very
good gallopers who’ve been out of
luck for quite a while; old Puffham
came to light to down Trover and
Mine Host in the Flying, while Blue
Legend (W. Fellows) very narrowly
beat Coalition and Frontal Attack
in the 10-furlongs James Barnes Plate.
A premature attempt to chase the
"bolter, Petulance, cost Frontal Attack
the Plate.
Other Randwick winners were Blue
Diamond (R. Coles) and Huarette
(F. Walker), the topweights in their
respective Two-year-old events; Our
Bill (T. Mullane) and Altairian (F.
Williams) taking divisions of the
Novice; and Polar Star bagging the
Welter,
Saturday’s Moonee Valley meeting
will be long rerr|embered by bookies
as Black Saturday, and by punters as
“the day I nearly backed the pro-
gramme.” The longest-priced winner
was a second-favorite at 5 to 1 (the
favorite being at fours); two other
second favorites were successful, three
favorites did the trick, and, in the
remaining race, favorite and second
fancy surprised the camera by dead-
heating.
The first deadheat for first possie
recorded since the camera has been
in use in Melbourne was between
El Faloos (A. Burton) and Gay
Silhouette (T. Unkovich) in the
second Seaside Handicap for two-
“A bit Weak, but it'll do to break ’em up.”
year-olds. The first had been won
very easily by Ralton (E. Preston)
with Phoibos and Poona in the places.
Favorites won both jumping events,
Nantilla (R. Hall) improving con-
siderably on his previous showing to
run away from Hemlock and Charles
Smart in the Hurdle, while old Gay
Invader, rising 14, gave Jockey Hall
a double in taking the Steeple from
Accelerate and Garofil. Hall con-
templates trying his luck in England,
where he should certainly hold his
own.
Vantage (W. Williamson) proved
best on the day of the three-year-olds
contesting the 10-furlongs Gellibrand
Handicap, Saxony and Del Rose being
closest at the finish. The Beach Welter
was won by Vaninka (B. Eames); and
A. Browning’s much-boomed Good
Idea finally did something to justify
his oats by just scrambling home
ahead of Hereward and Promise You
in the 13-furlongs Bay View Handi-
cap.

It took Shannon a while to crack
the ice in America, but he made a
stylish job of it when he did. Taking
the 10,000-dollars San Francisco
County Handicap, at Bay Meadows
(California), on Saturday, he beat
nothing of much account, but won
by the proverbial mile, and knocked
one-fifth of a second off the course
record for 91 furlongs established
by that fine galloper Seabiscuit in
1936.

The Australians in England:
After stoushing Leicestershire by
an innings and 171 runs, Miller alone
and unaided knocking up a beautiful
202, the tourists moved on to play
Yorkshire at Bradford—traditionally
a tough match and in this case living
right up to repute. Bradman took a
spell, leaving Hassett to lead the team
in a match which gave those who
played an experience of about the
worst weather conditions they need
expect to strike.
Winning the toss Sellers batted and
saw his side wiped for 71 in 165
minutes; Miller took 6 for 42 and
W. Johnston 4 for 22. Australia’s
struggle in the glue-pot was almost
equally pathetic; though 24 runs were
on the board for the first wicket, the
total was 101. Miller again did best
with 34. In true captain-fashion,
Sellers topped the scores in his second
innings with 21, the rest of his side
building the total to 89, Again it
was Miller (3 for 49) and Johnston
(6 for 18) who did the damage. With
the tourists in for their final knock,
the match became a thriller; 60 to
win and, at one stage, six down for
31. However, young Harvey (18) and
Tallon (17), thankful for many let-
offs in the field, saved the day.
Harvey gave himself the thrill of
winning the match with a crashing
sixer; the match all over in less than
two days.
The selectors stuck to the batting
big guns for the match v. Surrey
at The Oval on Saturday and, in
glorious sunshine, the Aussies piled
up 479 for four wickets. Belaboring
Surrey’s bowlers were Morris (65),
Barnes (176) —both went l.b.w. —Brad-
man (146 when clean-bowled by a
beautiful delivery from Alec Bedser),
Harvey (7), Hassett (61 n. 0.) and
Johnson (19 n. 0.).

Wallaby and Gordon captain
Trevor Allan turned on some scintil-

Saturday, his side downing Parra-

ting the lineouts and rucks. Eastern
Suburbs were lucky to beat Univer-
sity, 16-11. Randwick downed West-
ern Districts 30-3 at Coogee, St.
George beat West 23-12, with St.

ing 3 tries within 10 minutes, and
Eastwood, the junior team of the

defeating Drummoyne 8-3.

Accurate scoring kicks make or
mar a team in Australian football,
as Carlton discovered on Saturday
when, against Footscray, it had 18
shots to four in the first quarter —
most of them the kind that girls kick
—and could make only 3.15 against
’Scray’s 3.1. When ’Scray got the
wind jt put on 6.3 to 2.0. Carlton
was the better team everywhere except
round the goals and very nearly won
in spite of its flannel-footed forward
line —Footscray by two points, 15.8-
12.24. The best game was at Punt-
road, where Melbourne trailed Rich-
mond most of the way, caught them,
went back a point, then snapped a
goal on the bell to win 13.11-12.12.
Collingwood rattled up 10 quick goals
from the start against Geelong and
went on to an 18.13-13.10 win; Haw-
thorn downed North Melbourne,
14.21-11.15; Fitzroy swamped St.
Kilda, 19.14-6.8; Essendon did the
same for “Sowth,” 20.20-11.12.

If the current standard of pugilistic
imports save the dollar mark —is
maintained there will be no risk of
a repetition of the thrilling Dawson-
Patrick match. Latest in action was
another cullud gent, one Bobby
Maloney, who met Tommy Burns at
Sydney Stadium. Burns knocked him
in the third. The “fight” lasted to
the third purely because it took that
long for Burns’s punches to register
on the other’s granite dome.
* * * *
' Another import, Bennie Evans
(10.61), tackled Mickey Tollis (10.5*)
in Melbourne. In two previous fights
here Evans had lost on a foul to
Burns and subsequently outpointed
him. His chief offensive weapon
is a powerful lead, billygoat fashion.
As well as keeping up a running argu-
ment with the ref., Evans fought
Tollis with fists, elbows, shoulders
and skull, but still lost clearly on
points.

At Leichhardt it was Williams v.
Hall, both scaling 9.10 and carrying
the same monicker, Bernie. In desper-
ate eagerness to win, Williams tried
everything he knew and lost rounds
five and six through being cautioned
for palming. Much faster, Hall out-
boxed him all the way, had him very
groggy in the 12th, and landed a clear
points decision.

The Price of Gold
In the March 3 issue it was
pointed out that U.S. gold cur-
rency was changing hands in
France at the rate of $ll5 to
the ounce of fine gold. This was
equivalent to over £36 in Aus-
tralian currency. The price was
worked out from a report that
the equivalent of a gold dollar
was worth 3.3 paper dollars in
the Pajis free market, and an
ounce of gold in New York, of
course, would be bought offici-
ally at 35 paper dollars an ounce.
Last week in the Representa-
tives Mr. Archie Cameron asked
the Treasurer for the latest
quote for gold in the French
free market. Mr. Chifley sup-
plied the information that on
April 20 it was the equivalent
of £3l Australian per fine ounce,
converted (apparently from
francs) at the official rate of
exchange.
Obviously the paper money
of every country, including the
United States, is no longer worth
its pretended gold value. The
fact that the United States still
continues to attract the world’s
gold at $35 an ounce arises from
the urgent need of the gold-
producing countries to buy dol-
lar goods rather than cash their
gold for more dollars at some
later date.
The high price paid for gold
in France is partly prompted by
an attempt to preserve capital
at all costs in a part of the world
where confidence in paper cur-
rency had been shattered time
and time again. On the subjecf
of world gold prices in general,
London “Economist” recently
offered this information:
Although London and New York,
the main bullion markets, are tem-
porarily impeded in their international
gold business by the restrictions
placed on free dealings by their own
controls and at the instigation of the
International Monetary Fund, this
does not mean that no active inter-
national arbitrage business in gold can
take place. On the contrary, the gold
business in the Middle and Far East
has seldom been more active.
The basis for it is the exceptional
hoarders’ appetite, which has been
whetted to a fine edge by paper-
currency inflation and political un-
certainty. In satisfying this demand
the Syrians, above all others, have
come into their own as the champion
blackmarketeers. They are the mam
agents for this traffic in gold. They
buy largely from South America and
Abyssinia, and their supplies are also
fed indirectly by the coins provided
through British and American initia-
tive in Greece and other Middle
Eastern countries.
They sell largely to hoarders in the
Middle and Far East. Most of this
traffic involves smuggling and the
evasion of every kind of regulation.
But that is no deterrent or real handi-
cap to the gentlemen from Damascus.
The prizes are considerable. Though
the competition is now sufficiently
keen to give the semblance of
genuine arbitrage, the free prices do
not approximate to a recognisable
uniform parity. The price per ounce
in Hong Kong has been as high as
the equivalent of $53 but is now
about $47. In the Middle East the
price is now equivalent to about $4l.
These are prices on the basis of
which arbitrage is taking place, and
their disparity is a. measure of the
charges that have to be incurred in
this gold traffic. The prices paid
by the ultimate buyers in China and
elsewhere are considerably higher.
It is interesting to note that in the
free but essentially domestic market
for gold in France, coins are now
valued at the equivalent of over £2O
sterling per ounce. The market in
gold therefore bears all the marks
of disruption and disorganisation
caused by exchange controls and
national import- and export-licensing
systems of widely-varying degrees of
intensity. The principal common
thread that runs through the markets
is the fact that all free prices are
well above the official quotations.
Another of their characteristics is
that wherever the metal is quoted in
terms of both dollars and sterling the
quotations produce an equivalent of
about $3 to the pound. The signifi-
cance of that ratio should not be
pressed too far, but it cannot alto-
gether be ignored.
The official Australian price
for gold is £lO 15s. 3d. per fine
ounce, and the official exchange
rate on New York $3.20 to the
£ Australian.
Australian Bitumen
There are 7500 miles of bitu-
men roads in N.S.W.; the newly-
opened Shell refining plant at
Clyde (near Sydney) will pro-
duce enough to maintain the lot.
British-designed arid Australian-
built, except for some technical
equipment bought overseas, the
undertaking represents a capital
investment of more than
£650,000. Production of 30,000
tons of bitumen annually, with
“The crane-drivers can stay on strike as long as they
like now.”
subsidiary fuels—gasoline, kero-
sene, fuel and lubricating oils—
is expected to result in consider-
able dollar saving, as crude sup-
plies come from Venezuela, a
sterling area.
The benefits to Australian in-
dustry are largely self-evident.
It offers a supply independent of
overseas conditions and shipping
shortages, at cost reduced by
absence of transport charges.
The plant will anchor a good
portion of purchasing-power in
Australia. One of the most im-
portant economies effected will
be that derived from handling
bulk supplies, with intermediary
handling, packaging and storing
eliminated. Previously bitumen
was carried from overseas in
steel containers from which it
was impossible to extract it with-
out ruining the package.
Now crude oil, from which the
tar is refined, is carried by Shell
tankers and stored in H-million-
gallon tanks. After cracking, it
will again be stored in its refined
form in bulk, until delivered by
rail tank-wagons or road-tankers.
Maoriland Exchange
Odds are against any move in
New Zealand’s exchange rate.
This isn ? t official, but it is the
view of economic experts, based
on latest evidence. Yet many
think £NZI2S to £lOO sterling is
an unnatural rate, and say M.L.’s
pound should be on a par with
John Bull’s. Is there any natural
rate? Probably only so far as
any other price is natural, and
that depends on supply and de-
mand. For nine years now N.Z.
has been well on the credit side
in dealings with J.B. Once or
twice since Maoriland was near
the bottom of the bucket, with
only £7 million left at the end of
1938, overseas funds have soared
to a peak of more than £lOO
million, and lately they’ve been
over £9O million (Reserve Bank
and trading-bank holdings).
This hoard has started some
people thinking, hoping or fear-
ing that the exchange might sud-
denly jump back to par, after
18 years up in the air, and
another idea is that dollar pres-
sure might push sterling far
enough off balance to wipe out
the 25 p.c. gap, if M.L. could
hold its present dollar rate. But
if this happened stabilisation
might put N.Z. and J.B. in the
cactus. A lot of Maorilanders,
fed-up with controls, wouldn’t
be sorry to see stabilisation get
a body-blow, and experts agree
that road might be the shortest
to real recovery. But it would
be “hard, relentless and sudden
in a world that is trying to be
kind, tolerant and gradual.”
They plump for a middle course,
with more freedom. Stable ex-
change they look on as an
anchor while prices and costs
get into new positions.
The Dominion may have
missed a golden chance to take
a fall out of its pound a couple
of years ago when Sweden and
one or two others were busy in
that direction. That was before
the big post-war rush of im-
ports for restocking began to
pour in. Today traders are
carrying stocks big enough to
sink some of them if prices were
sliced by a cut in the pound.
And farmers with land and other
debts chalked up at present ex-
change levels don’t want action,
either—not yet. No more does
the Government, which is bound
by law to cough-up enough mil-
lions to cover any loss it forces
on bankers. Governments are
nearly as human as anyone else
when it comes to running into
debt; so it should be a safe bet
that Finance Minister Nash has
plenty of support for playing the
waiting game until stored-up ex-
change funds are a lot lower.
Taxation that’s killing the
goose has Maoriland business-
leaders worried as lavish Gov-
ernment spending goes merrily
on at boom levels, and firms
can’t put aside enough for the
rainy day they think isn’t far
off. Public revenue, well into
nine figures for 1947-48, tops
last year’s mammoth
£108,294,000, and brings M.L.
dangerously near to breaking-
point. Taxes have been trebled
since Labor got into the saddle
12j years ago, and the Fraser-
Nash concern has been pumping
back the swollen millions into
circulation channels with great
gusto, reinforced by Reserve
Bank credit to the tune of £35
millions, mainly for State hous-
ing. Hefty death-duties, social-
security payments, post-office
savings-bank millions and “tap-
loan” moneys have all gone into
the pool along with the tax
flood. State departments as well
as private enterprise are feeling
the kick-back in mounting costs,
prices and wages, which are
eating up funds'.

A NEW DEVELOPMENT
Spreader Firing, combined with
Forward Moving Grate
The introduction of the
Forward Moving Grate,
discharging ash continu-
ously, has widened the scope
of Spreader Firing because:
1. Combustion conditions
are not disturbed by inter-
mittent ash removal.
2. There is no clinker for-
mation, even with ash
having very low fusion tem-
perature, as the bulk of the
air required for combustion
passes through and cools
the ash thereby
avoiding harmful deposits
on the pressure parts.
3. Automatic control is
simply applied.
4. High burning rates are
readily attained, as the fuel
and the air are evenly dis-
tributed over every square
foot of grate area.

TOBRUK
By "EK DUM"
April of 1941 came in in North
Africa with growing concern for
the men of the A.I.F. who were
still there. The effervescent
weeks of the December-February
advance were passed.
Sidi Barrani, Bardia, Tobruk
had all passed into history along
with the other actions against
Mussolini’s painted hordes, of
which a disgruntled warrior was
reported to have complained:
“Gripes Almighty, the cops in
Tel Aviv give yer a better scrap
than this.” The British Seventh
Division, that hard-shelled body
whose record was to run
through the history of the whole
war from Egypt to the Lune-
burger Walde, had virtually
finished the Cyrenaican cam-
paign at Beda Fomm, scooping
up the remnants of Graziani’s
legions. south of Benghazi—a
mere 20,000 which looked like a
battalion beside the 38,000
roped-in at Sidi Barrani, the
45,000 at Bardia and the 25,000
at Tobruk. Then the drive in
the desert hauled up taut at the
limit of -its communication-
lines, 900 miles from its main
supply bases, with Benghazi
harbor closed by enemy bombers,
which R.A.F. defence was- too
tenuous to keep down.
The gallant desert vanguard
had been pushed forward to the
bottom of the Cyrenaican Gulf,
175 miles below Benghazi. Here
only a squadron of tanks, an
armored-car regiment, two in-
fantry battalions (A.1.F.) and
meagre artillery could be sup-
ported.
It faced in front the El
Agheila position, the western or
enemy gate to the Libyan fight-
ing area, which was secure
on the flanks,
It was necessary to hold the
El Agheila gateway closed, since
once through it any heavy mo-
bile enemy force capable of
swift movement could menace
the whole wide-open southern
flank and lines of communica-
tion of the British Empire
Forces.
When Field-Marshal Erwin
Rommel put his grip on El
Agheila on March 24 the world
had more important things to
think of for the moment. It
took the Italian defeat in Libya,
for granted. It had little thought
of Germans in Africa. When,
late in March, Rommel advanced
suddenly and snapped up Mersa
Brega, Cairo gaily announced
that Mersa Brega was of no sig-
nificance whatever and General
Rommel could have it, since it
was unlikely that the enemy
would embark on large-scale
operations in Libya at this time
y £ ar.
Rommel's Force
That day, however, Swiss
Radio announced that it had
been told in Berlin that General
Rommel had four powerful
divisions. This was true, and his
troops had been specially trained
in sand technique on the Baltic
shore. He had the Fifth Light
Motor Division, the 21st
Armored Division (Mark Ills
and I Vs), »the 135th Italian Divi-
sion and five Italian infantry
divisions.
The Ninth Appears
Australia was represented
upon the scene by the almost
newly-cohstifuted Ninth Divi-
sion, which had acquired the
20th and 26th Brigades from
the Seventh, now gone off ,to
Greece, beside the 24th,; which
. remained with it. John Murray’s
20th was up at EL Agheila sup-
porting the British Third
Armored Brigade, bailed
“armored” more or less by
courtesy. The troops of the
Ninth were raw, but ffine, in
physique. Their transport was
sketchy in relation to their task,
and they were short in many im-
portant divisions of equipment.
Their field regiments were
without guns, their “light horse”
without carriers. The division
was, in fact, the mere infantry
skeleton of a formation with not
too much flesh on its bones. Its
commander was Major-General
(“Ming the Merciless”) Mors-
head, its.Gl (Chief of Staff)
that large, cool, capable soldier
Colonel C- E. M. (“Gaffer”)
Lloyd, afterwards' Adjutant-
General in Australia, a Dun-
trooner who had been just old
enough to enjoy a whiff of
World War I on the Rhine.
Morshead had been in favor
of withdrawing the 20th from
the front face of the defence
early in March, since it could
be of little help, and although
Generals. Waveil and Dill (Chief
of the General Staff), who visited
the Benghazi area, supported
Lieutenant - General Neame,
V.C., against the Australians’
belief that Rommel intended to
sweep along the desert flank to
the south, they agreed that the
20th should be pulled in.
Back from Er Regima
It was with this brigade that
the retreat began. On March
23 it was positioned, east and
north-east of Benghazi, on the
60-odd mile front of the Er Re-
gima escarpment, about 30 miles
to the east of Benghazi itself.
It was a task too much for
even a Wellington with three
battalions —2/13th, 2/15th and
2/17th, the last heirs of the
tradition of Mont St. Quentin,
who had with them one dr two
veteran officers of World War I.
To these were added a battalion
of the 26th, a battalion some-
where coming up to support, and
16 guns from the 51st British
Field Regiment for artillery
backing.
By April 3 the worst fears
had been realised. The Third
British Armored Brigade had
cracked. German armor was on
its way to Mekili on the southern
flank as Morshead had feared it
would be. With the arrival of
Sir Richard O’Connor the re-
treat began. On April 4 the
British evacuated Benghazi with
the 20th Brigade covering the
retirement. F. A. Burrows’s
2/13th remained to slow the
German tide with three com-
panies, two a.-t. guns and four
4.5-inch howitzers. These were
holding two passes—the main
one and another—with one com-
pany in reserve, along nine
miles of the escarpment.
Halfway through the after-
noon a brigade of Germans and
Italians in lorries, with a screen
of 16 tanks, moved up. The
main pass was mined, but the
enemy was guided to the un-
mined one. There was a tough
little fight in which the auto-
matic - fire of the Australians
was beaten down by 75s and
heavy m.gs. and mortars. The
51st Field Regiment appeared.
German tanks were disabled —
one a Digger rushed single-
handed and captured the crew.
This was the beginning of a
horrible night in which the roads
were choked with vehicles and
men rolling along by looted
Barce, which was given over to
the Arabs.
, News that the Germans were
at Mekili, only 50 miles south
of Derna, while the Australians
were a hundred miles west of it,
called for all the speed possible
to prevent being surrounded as
they might have been had the
Germans not paused two days.
As it was the Australians got
back precariously to Gazala.
The 2/ 13th rolled along in cap-
tured Italian lorries to cover one
road from Mekili; the 2/48th
the other. But all was confusion.
Germans and British presently
were mixed up, each scarce
knowing where the others were.
There were losses of small
A.I.F. units, including one bat-
talion H.Q. Generals O’Connor,
Neame and Gambier-Parry were
captured. But eventually, in
miraculous fashion, the columns
reached Tobruk through a merci-
ful duststorm, not a moment too
soon.
Lavarack Takes Over
On the morning of the Bth a
Lockheed blew into Tobruk
through the dust pall with Gen-
eral Waveil and Major-General
Lavarack, the high-tempered
Queenslander who had been
chosen to command in Cyren-
aica, vice General Neame,
a conference in Cairo. Presently
General Waveil scribbled his
orders on a sheet of note-paper
in pencil. Lavarack was to take
command of all troops in Cyren-
aica. His main task was to be
to hold the enemy’s advance at
Tobruk, in order to give time for
the assembly of reinforcements,
especially of armored troops, to
stem the advance on Egypt.
Waveil thought it might be neces-
sary to keep Tobruk for two
months!
There were, at the beginning,
about 35,300 troops in Tobruk.
They were not a designed force.
(Continued on page 35.)


ABPRIGNALITIES
“E,”: A dozen Orpingtons were dust-
bathing serenely in the middle of the
road through Gongalong, and two men
and a dog were lounging on the pub
verandah. An hour passed while the men
engaged in desultory conversation, the
dog slept and the chooks gave the only
signs of animation. Then an aged and
decrepit utility chugged into the “town-
ship” from somewhere in the direction
of the horizon and crawled to a stop in
front of Charlie Waite’s store. The two
conversationalists watched the driver step
out and dawdle inside. The sandy-haired
cove fidgeted and looked down the road.
“Think I’ll be makin’ home,” he
drawled. “The missus wanted me t’ get
a few things from Charlie, but I reckon
I’ll come in f’r ’em next week. She won’t
mind when I tell her Charlie was busy.”
* * * *
“Waarom”: Stranded whales have
often produced problems for shire
councils on the Victorian coast, but no-
thing like the problem presented to the
South Melbourne Council by the humble
mussel. Some mysterious sea-change and
heavy storms have landed thousands of
tons of the edible mollusc on to the
beaches, and decomposition has produced
a dense cloud of sulphuretted hydrogen
which has moved 10,000 ratepayers to
sign a petition for their removal. A
former Army man believes he has a way
out. With the aid of two bulldozers he
pushed 1100 tons of mussels back into
the sea. His theory is that sea-lice will
soon make the shellfish innocuous and
“Tell the mechanic to hurry, will you! I've got to pick the wife up
in half an hour."
the empty shells will be washed back on
to the beach, when they can be removed
at leisure.

“C.E.”; Hal was taking a short-cut
across country when he spotted the fern-
hook propped against the trunk of a
greybox. Investigating, he discovered
old Bob a few feet away snoring com-
fortably in the shade. “Thought you’d
left these parts,” he remarked as Bob
sat up rubbing his eyes, “Didn’t you
retire from work and shift into town to
live?,” “Well, yair, I did,” yawned Bob
slowly, “but it wasn’t a success.” He
reached dreamily for the makings. “Too
many flamin’ things t’ do down there,”
he went on. “Gripes, if it wasn’t the
front hedge t’ be cut it wus) the flamin’
garden to be dug or some such silly
nonsense the missus’d think up. Things
a bloke never had to worry about before.
I tell y’, I wus clean run orf me legs.
Got crook, too, an’ the doc, said it’s the
diff’rent sort o’ livin’ that’s threw me
out. It’s right what they tell y’ about a
man goin’ t’ bits once ’e retires. Don’t
ever give up y’r work, Hal,” the old
bloke advised. “It don’t pay.” He
propped hisi head more comfortably and
blinked at the sky. “Why, I’m twice
the bloke,” he added, “since I come back
an’ took this job workin’ for a cocky
again.”
* * * *
“Conda”: Flying-fish don’t fly. Their
pectoral- or side-fins are greatly enlarged,
and the after-fin is very long. Rapidly
vibrated as the fish leaves the water, it
has much the same effect as a ship’s screw,
and the outspread pectorals allow it to
glide for about 50yds. The fish sails
along just above water, and it has only
to dip its propelling unit to get another
burst of air-speed. But this movement
bears about as much relation to true
flight as a dive from a springboard to the
way of an eagle.
* * * *
“Bosun’s Mate”: While fish use radar
principles for steering (B. 28/4/’4B), the
octopus employs jet-propulsion as part of
its locomotion. On the posterior side of
the highly-muscular covering that pro-
tects the fish’s viscera like a mantle is
a hollow muscled funnel. The expansion
and contraction of the mantle sets up a
current of water which is drawn in under
it and expelled with force from the funnel.
Its rapid ejection, thrusting against the
comparatively resistant sea, shoots the
octopus backwards at considerable speed.
As with the modern aircraft jet, there is
a means of sealing the mantle while
water is under compression in the funnel.
Two almost rigid studs of muscle on the
mantle lock into corresponding sockets
on the head, so that one is locked to the
other as securely as a breech-block to a
gun.

“Alpine Willie”: “Hanko” (B.
21/4/’4B), who has heard but not seen
the coachwhip-bird, wouldn’t find him a
stranger long in this Victorian sub-alpine
forest and scrub. Coachie haunts the
deep undergrowth of gullies here and can
be quietly observed at normal feeding
and songmaking. Once watched one
poised in a hopscrub bush. The long-
drawn “phweee” was made with a steadily
elongating neck, which at full extension
was flung forward to give effect to the
explosive “tchi,” There followed after
a short pause, sotto voce, the echoing
“chu-chu” from the same performer,
which ruled out what I’d been told about
his mate adding the finishing bits.
Though I was in full view of the.top-
knotted fowl the calls went on for fully
20 minutes.
* * * *
“Goldie”: The jackhammer rig is set
up from wall to wail in the drive, and Alf
awaits the tap-tap on the pipeline which
signals that the compressed-air is up
to pressure. When it comes he winds
the cradle to advance the bitted drill to
the rock and flips the tap-lever. Immedi-
ately a deep rumbling roar fills the drive-
way to bursting point. Flying scats,
sparks and dust shower as the drill chews
a collar for the hole and dwindle to a
steady dust-trickle as the steel probes
deeper. The first drill bores 9in. and
is changed for a longer one; progres-
sively the hole goes in 3ft. While the
’hammer is silent on the changes of steel
the steady whir of the compressor-valves.
carried in the pipeline, takes up a quiet
refrain. Alf is covered with a film of
grey dust, floats in a haze of dust, sneezes
and spits dust. He bores six holes from
various angles, and the newchum, Charlie,
comes along with the explosive charges in
a box as Alf is halfway through the last
one. Charlie is standing watching the
racing drill when a sudden, earsplitting
bang shakes the tunnel, and both carbide
flares vanish in a rush of air. Harry,
who’s been tending the engine, gnns
"Well, he WAS here about a Week ago.”
broadly when Charlie, badly shaken,
crawls out of the tunnel on hands and
knees. “F-flamin’ gelignite went orf,” he
stutters, “’Gripes, I’m lucky t’ git orf
without a scratch. Poor old Alf must’ve
got the full blast.” But Alf is not far
behind, carrying the lights. He grins at
Harry over the newchum’s head. “I
told y’ the bloody air-hose was rotten,”
he says. “She blew out near the
couplin’! ”
* * * *
“E. 2”: Alec was ploughing the corner
paddock for a crop of maize, and Fanny
the tractor was in a reluctant frame of
mind. It was late morning and he hadn’t
got her moving. He’d had the horses
tow her to the top of the rise a third
time and was preparing to launch her
again when he heard and saw the disturb-
ance past the house. Mullins’s two kids,
a little girl and a boy, were cowering at
the base of a tree, screaming in terror.
The Jersey bull, head lowered and tail
rigid, was making threatening lunges at
the kids, and the screams were infuriating
him further. Alec let the tractor roll.
, Halfway down the slope he slammed
her into gear and yanked so hard on the
throttle-lever that it came away in his
hand, jamming the throttle wide open.
Fanny started up in a series of coughing
grunts, followed by a steady, power-laden
whine. Down they charged at the bull,
which just saved the collision by a startled
jump to the side. Alec swung the tractor
round in a vicious turn of speed. The
now-terrified bull took to his heels. Fanny
followed, flat-out in a sobbing whine. The
bull galloped and the relentless machine
closed the gap. When the tractor was
almost on his heels the bull turned sharply
to the left. Alec, wearing his usual
wooden expression, swung the wheel.
The smoking machine took the bull in
the ribs like a broadside and subsided
with him in a dustcloud. “A pity I
wasn’t able t’ git in a round or two of
the ploughin’ while Fanny was going’
so good,” was all Alec said as he regarded
the wreckage after he’d been revived.

“L.K.E.”: Gympie Marks and Alf
were contract-sinking a shaft for Rawson.
They arrived in the township one Satur-
day, announced that the shaft was down
the desired 60 feet and collected their
earnings. The following week Rawson
met Gympie in the pub. “That shaft y’
put down,” he said without preamble.
“It’s only down 50ft,” “But we bottomed
at 60,” Gymp said. “Y’ must’ve measured
wrong.” “No fear I didn’t,” Rawson said.
“I ran a new tape down from the sill.”
“You measured from the top down?”
queried Gympie. “Well, we ran our
tape up from the bottom and it measured
60. If the shaft’s a bit short it can’t be
at the bottom end where y’ paid us t’
work. Must be the top end that’s short,
and there wasn’t anything about that in
our contract. We were paid t’ sink the
shaft.”

“Esk D.”: The road over which Tommy
Dow drives the mail three times a week
by horse and sulky is deep-rutted and
studded with rounded granite stones.
Ginger has grown old on the job and is
proppy in the front legs, but bowls along
at a fair pace. Tommy lounges back on
the seat and holds the reins with a good
bit of slack. Every so often one of
Ginger’s*front hooves tips a stone, where-
upon he takes a sudden stumble and
threatens to nose-dive, but Tommy saves
the fall by yanking powerfully on the
reins and just managing to lift Ginger on
to his legs and restore his equilibrium.
“Why don’t y’ keep a tighter grip on
the reins?” I chipped him. “Be easier
on you and the nag when he trips.” “Aw,
be y’r age,” retorted Tommy.
wouldn’t expect Ginger’d ever learn t
lift ’is blasted hooves if he relied on me
holdin’ him up, would y’? If he only
did it be accident now an’ then I’d keep
a firm rein, but Ginger does it so often
I’ve got to have patience an’ train him
properly. When it sinks into his skull
that he’s liable t’ break his neck he’ll
give up the habit!”

“Bon-Yi”: All this talk of water
running out of the bath-tub with clock-
wise motion in the Southern Hemisphei'e
may be correct, but can anyone say why
all vines and climbing plants invariably
twine themselves around their supports
in a right-to-left spiral instead of any-
how at all? In one thick vine-scrub I
examined creepers of every type and size
followed the same direction around the
trunks and branches, except one. It went
in reverse for a few feet, then doubled
back and followed the mob. Perhaps
it was momentary forgetfulness.

“Golden Fleece”; Tell “Alpine Willie”
(B. 17/3/’4B) that proclamations for
rabbit destruction are not meant for the
benefit of trappers. Last week I poisoned
4200 rabbits, equivalent in feeding capa-
city to 600 sheep. If rabbitskins were at
their peak of Is. each this would be worth
£2lO. It is a poor jumbuck that won’t
return £1 per head at present. It is time
the fallacy of bunnies and dollars was
exploded in favor of the real money-
spinner, sheep,

“Mrs. Stumpjump”: I got a surfeit of
bush elocution in my pre-marriage days
when the minister at East Creek mobi-
lised talent for quarterly concerts in aid
of his church. After the first few shows
there was little novelty, and anybody in
the audience could have prompted the
lasses regularly beefing out “Lost,”
“Guilty or Not Guilty,” “Papa’s Letter”
and other hackneyed pieces. Humor,
however, was strictly taboo, for, as the
minister said, the Bible had never once
recorded that the Savior laughed. Dad
always maintained that this inference was
altogether illogical and unfair, the Savior
never having never seen the East Creek
congregation, heard its choir or glimpsed
its minister on horseback. Still, humor
often lurked round the corner. There
was the night when Mary Blank, chief
elocutionist, added “The Wives of Brix-
ham” to her repertoire. When the
desperate fishermen’s wives had got to
the point of burning their bedding and
most of their house-chattels to act as a
beacon to their storm-harried men the
form at the rear, always commandeered
by the local lads, collapsed. The minister
told Mary to stay on the platform and
resume when all was quiet, but by then
most had lost the thread of the Brixham
epic, for Mrs. B. had rushed to the back
and bitterly castigated the youths for de-
liberately spoiling her Mary’s new reci-
tation, and then old McPhie, the par-
son’s chief henchman, had busied him-
self putting a form for the unseated right
in the front under the ministerial eye.
Then Mary began just where she left off:
Give us the men and the bare ground,
We want no more tonight.
That was all. Old Hardcase, inveigled
into escorting wife and daughters to such
shivoos, burst into hearty laughter,
echoed by a dozen other graceless souls
and the lads in front; while most
feminine expressions, whether of pained
disgust, stifled amusement or bland inno-
cence, were worth a fiver a minute. The
minister’s wife next day told the presi-
dent of the Ladies’ Guild that John
wished he’d been called to China or the
islands, for he was sure he could have
served the Lord better anywhere than at
East Creek.
BUNGOBOONA JAIL.
the jail was falling down
In Bungoboona town;
To make due preparations
For urgent renovations
A. builder serving ten
Years hard for robbing men
But loved by all the warders
Was given certain orders
To measure corridors,
And windows, walls and floors.
Working with heart and vim,
With no one eyeing him,
A convict with free rein
To go and come again,
So, with his steel tape, he
Was full of industry!
Measured the width and length,
The thickness and the strength
Of every structural bit
As he saw good and fit.
Measured the outer wall,
The road —to get the fall —•
The gate, the iron rail,
The roadway from the jail,
The river-bank (far side),
The nearest paddock wide;
And later, after that,
A farmer’s Sunday hat,
And in a shop, to boot,
Measured himself a suit;
The cash-box in a pub,
A country store for grub;
And then went measuring, too,
The wildest country through.
Then came a rumor strange,
From out behind the range,
Somewhere beyond the plains
Where only silence reigns—
A man who winked his eye
As he went measuring by.

“Bo”; “The shyest cove I ever knew,”
declared Bobbra Ben, “was Jack Sparks,
a horsebreaker from up Come-By-
Chance way. By comparison he made
that big bloke Mat seem a mincin’ lady’s
man. Used to shy up trees if he saw a
sheila cornin’ towards him. Then a new
fellow took over the block next to Jack’s
people, and his daughter took a likin’ to
Jack. Although he put up a good fight it
was a losin’ one. In two years she had
him pretty near broken-in, but he still
shied every time she made a noise like
an orange-blossom. After another six
months’ hard work on him by the sheila,
her eight brothers and sisters and her
parents as well as his own family, they
eventually got him to the church, but
when Jack sees the parson he starts to
paw the ground and lays his ears back as
if he’s about to bolt. They grabbed him,
and there’s a lot o’ yappin’ about how
they’re goin’ to get him inside. Then,
one of her brothers, who knew a bit
about horses, too, tied a handkerchief
around Jack’s eyes and led him up the
steps and along the aisle to the altar
backwards. He went as quietly as old
Captain when he’s pullin’ the water-sled.”

“Gravelsnatcher”: A link with a nor’-
Westralian tragedy snapped recently
when the Concordia, a Fremantle coal-
hulk, was towed out and lowered into the
“graveyard” nea/ Rottnest Island. A
four-masted barque, she was at Balia
Balia loading copper-ore from the Whim
Creek mines when the Koombana, with a
full passenger list, left Port Hedland on
March 19, 1912, to sail into the worst
storm the north has experienced. She
went down with all hands, the only
wreckage found being a cabin-door and
a bathroom grating. The master was
criticised later for leaving port when the
cyclone was approaching, but old hands
on the spot vindicated his action. The
tide was receding. Had he waited over-
night he’d have been “neaped” and faced
with a stay in port of over a week. As
it was, he was forced to empty his ballast-
tanks to clear the bar, and before he
could regain ballast the blow struck him,
and the Koombana, a topheavy craft at
the best of times, keeled over. The
tragedy stirred the continent and brought
a variety of theories to light, but it seems
certain the ship went down about 80 miles
from Hedland. No bodies were recovered.
At Balia Balia the Concordia was swept,
on an even keel, on to. the only stretch of
beach on De Puich Island. She was re-
floated, but, never seaworthy again,
finished her days as a coal-hulk,

“Lub”: Fred and Burkie dwelt in
separate huts at Mosquito Bend, and rela-
tions were sometimes a bit strained over
Fred’s half-bred water-spaniel. Rover
was often hanging about Burkie’s camp
for tucker. Fred was jealous and Burkie
highly indignant. “Y’r dawg’s bin at me
bread agen,” Burkie complained one
morning. “Had me fresh loaf out o’ the
box.” “Did y’ see him do it?” Fred
asked. “Well, not exackly,” Burkie said.
“But” “It’s alwus the same with you
suspicious blokes,” Fred cut in. * “Rover
might’ve had a few sniffs an’ a couple o’
licks at y’r bread, but nothin’ t’ harm it.
Y’ know damn’ well he wouldn’t go y’r
bread!”

“Mat’s Mate”: We camped on the
Murray in S.A. just in time to observe
the prideful installation of a drinking-
“bubbler” outside the school. Late that
day a small boy was approaching the
bubbler and Mat said to him, “Hey, better
not drink out of that, kid, or you’ll get
what I got.” He pulled a painful expres-
sion and rubbed his belly with dark sig-
nificance, The kid eyed him closely and
withdrew, waterless. About 24 hours
later two coves invaded our camp and
identified themselves as the shire clerk and
health-inspector. “You the bloke that got
crook after drinking from the new
bubbler?” they asked. Mat denied the
first part. “Here, didn’t you'tell somebody
not to drink or they’d get what you got?
What did you get?” demanded the in-
spector anxiously. A grin gleamed faintly
in Mat’s eye and vanished. “Come on,
“Come on, Daisy, let the man draw you.”
what did you get?” Mat stood up.
“Water,” he said, “but the kid didn’t wait
f’r me to put it across him. He”
“Look,” said the inspector, “you’re one o’
them funny fellows. Well, that kid told
his mother the water poisoned a man, she
told somebody else and away it went.
Not a kid in that school will go near the
dashed bubbler an’ the people reckon it’s
a menace to public health.” We left next
morning and I still don’t know how they
got out of it.

“Betcha”: One never finds a rabbit or
hare make a mistake when locating a
hole he knows of in a fence. Even when
the hole is of recent origin and the
quarry is put up half a mile or so away
he charges straight for the fence where
every post looks the same, and with un-
erring accuracy dives through the broken
mesh. The fact that he dashes his head
on the correct spot when the opening
has been closed against him, as well as
the speed at which he is often travelling,
is evidence that his eyesight is not the
sense responsible for his location suc-
cess. Have heard it argued that he re-
members small trails, tussocks, etc., in
the vicinity and uses them as guides, but
both hares and rabbits will scuttle across
a freshly-ploughed paddock and strike
the fence-hole dead centre. Don’t say
a hare makes holes in the netting, but he
finds the weak places and enlarges them.
Watched one old codger investigate span
after span for a broken strand in the
mesh. Starting at ground-level and
finishing on hind toes to reach the top, he
went thoroughly over every foot before
going on round the next post to begin
again.

“Chuck”; Old Fanner prided himself
on his memory for locations, and having
washed payable dirt in the gully behind
Robinson’s many years ago, decided to
return and work the area. Arriving, he
walked up and down for some time, then,
scraping up a dish of soil, went down
to the creek. A bit later he was back to
try a dishful from another spot. Another
and yet another hole followed, and
Fanner was squatting perplexedly on a
rock surveying the scene when Tom
Robinson rode up. “Sixty years,” the
old prospector told him sadly, “and I
ain’t ever f’got before. Y’ know,- Tom,
I could ’a’ swore this gully run straight
in a line with them boulders down there
on the other side. Yet here she ri over
here, an’ there’s the ridge that never was
anything but a hive o’ rabbit-warrens.
Yair, an’ still is, be the look o’ things.”
“Yes, but they ain’t the same burrers,”
Tom defended stoutly. “Gripes, we dug
out every foot o’ the flamin’ things a few
years back. Y’r old prospectin’ gully?
Aw, I bet y’ll find ’er back there again
after we’ve dug them rabbits out the next
time. Y’ see, we ’ave t’ chuck the flamin’
dirt somewhere

“Wonk”: Down by the road fence Bob
helped the sick calf to its wobbly legs and
turned to meet old Mac. “ ’Day, Bob,”
greeted the old bloke. “See your crops
didn’t do much good.” “No,” returned
the other disgustedly. “Not a decent feed
on the lot for a milker. And after all the
work I put in, too. Blast the Gover’-
ment, I say.” Mac nodded sympatheti-
cally. “And I bet your cows aren’t giv-
ing much,” he added. “Much! They’re
hardly worth milkin’,” growled Bob. “But
what’s a man t’ do? That’s the flamin’
Gover’ment for y’,” he snarled. Mac
raised an eyebrow inquiringly. “Aw, I
wouldn’t have had any o’ this if it hadn’t
been for them,” Bob aired his pet griev-
ance. “I’d have been out of this poverty
class. Wouldn’t be rililkin’, I can tell
y’.” He drew forth a dejected cigarette-
butt. “Know old Forbes from over
Limestone way?” he continued. “Heaps
of dough and a beaut, daughter. Fair
shook on me she was, too. Blime, a
bloke’s stiff, eh? Married t’ young Andy
now.” Mac raised his other eyebrow.
“But why didn’t you hop ih yourself.
Bob? Take her out a bit and all that.”
“Take her out!” Bob almost barked.
“Hell, how could a cove get over to see
her even, let alone take her out on a lousy
three gallons!” Limestone’s about 30
miles from here.

“C.E.”: Was propping up the post-
office verandah the other evening wait-
ing for the mail when the town’s most
indefatigable female loomed up, complete
with notebook and jar of seeds. “Only
a shilling a guess,” she announced, hand-
ing me the jar, “and you might win this
lovely prize.” I glanced at the treasure.
“All hand-woven,” she gushed, exhibiting
the rug. “None of your machine-
made stuff. Isn’t it beautiful, now?
It took weeks and weeks to make,
and you know hand-made work is worth
a lot of money.” I scribbled my monicker
in the appointed place and inquired the
destination of the proceeds. “All going
to help some poor native folk in the
islands,” I was informed. “Very back-
ward people—no progress, no machinery,
no easy methods of doing things. Why,
poor things, would you believe,” her voice
dropped to a confiding murmur, “their
cooking utensils, their ornaments, and
even the clothes they wear have all to be
made by hand! ”

“Blime”: Ben rode into the sports-
ground where the big annual event was
in progress, hitched his horse and made
for the crowd that indicated the bar.
“ ’Day, Bill,” he greeted. “See the fires
on the range behind my place? Gripes,
I’d like t’ catch the idiot that lit ’em.
Yair, I’ll have one. Burnin’ the bush, I
s’pose.” “Keeping dry, Ben?” came a
voice on the other side. “Yair, wish it’d
rain ’an put them fires out,” agreed Ben.
“Lit deliberate, too.” “Hey, Ben,” called
another, “y’ seen a stray baldy steer
with” “Haven’t seen anything but
fires out my way,” Ben answered.
“Reckon I know who done it, too. If the
wind changes my paddock’s a goner. It
isn’t right, I’m going over to word-up the
John about it, and the forestry bloke, and
the fire-brigade cap.” An hour later Ben
was back at the bar. “Seen the fires,
Barney?” he asked. “Too close in, I tell
y’. Jail’s too good for the bloke that
started it. Remember the ’39 fires,
Charlie? They were bad.” Some time
later Ben turned towards his nag. “Got
to git back and shee to them fires,” he
explained. “Dangeroush, them fires.
Shouldn’t ’a’ come, only . . . Cripesh, it
doesh a bloke good t’ git out an’ forget
hish worries for a bit, eh?”

“Zake”; Once saw an agriculturist ac-
cidentally hack the back of his hand with
a tomahawk. Immediately he whistled
up his blue cattle-dog, to which he held
out the injured member. The tyke pro-
ceeded with licking operations, “No
dirt left there after he’s finished with it,”
he declared. “A dog’s mouth is the
cleanest thing you can see!” Four days
later the familiar lump at the gland
under the armpit appeared, and it took the
doc. nearly a fortnight of untiring effort
to save the arm from amputation. After
he’d recovered from the worst ca-se of
blood-poisoning I ever saw I remarked
to him that it was possible Towser’s gob
wasn’t exactly a substitute for a strong
antiseptic. “Oh, I dunno,” exclaimed the
cheerful idiot, “his mouth was clean
enough; I suppose it was some of the
dirt got deep into the cut and he couldn’t
get at it.” Some bush beliefs certainly
die hard.
APRIL WILLOW.
Restless on the river
Bent willows play,
In keys more gold than green
Each April day,
Of parched leaves fallen —
An eddied, minor theme;
Ghosts of the dance
Borne downstream.
And, as days grow colder,
The thought keeps straying
That willow rods next year
Will still be playing,
Downstream to wintertide
Playing autumn out —
And I a year in debt
To spring and summer’s rout.

THE MAN ON THE LANS
"DON'T WORRY,I'M SENDING IT TO GRAZACOS."
The Channel Country.
“C. Punch”: The development
of the diesel road-train for
transporting fats to the nearest
railroad —one firm is hauling
three to five trailers, each carry-
ing 100 head —should bring the
Queensland channel country well
into reckonings of national
economy, since it overcomes the
long droving and enables the
fats to reach their markets in a
fifth of the time.
* This channel country, which
touches the Three Corners, on
the borders of N.S.W., Queens-
land and S.A., is nominated by
Arthur F. Bell, Queensland
Under-Secretary for Agriculture,
as “a vast, natural irrigation
system [which] ranks among the
world’s most interesting natural
features.” It is the system of
creeks, outflows, flood areas,
waterholes, lagoons and small
lakes fed by the Georgina, the
Diamantina and Barcoo rivers
and is what remains of what was,
seons ago, a vast river system
running down from the northern
mountains into the Centre.
For a distance of about 200 miles
upstream from the S.A. border there
is no well-defined single stream, but
a complex network of criss-crossing
shallow channels. Aerial photographs
reveal these remarkable streams as
resembling a gigantic and unevenly-
spread fishing-net of variable-sized
mesh.
Bell points out, in the
“Queensland Agricultural Gaz-
ette” for March, that the
periodic floods come from the
headwaters up in the monsoon
areas, and the channel country
on each of the three main rivers
varies in width from five to 40
miles. The “Gazette” carries
aerial pictures of the country
which clearly show the “fishing-
net.” As the floods pass south
there follows vigorous growth
of “quick-maturing annual
grasses, clover and herbage,”
when it becomes “perhaps the
best cattle-fattening country in
the Commonwealth. The feed
remains palatable and nutritious
for several months after each
single irrigation.”
Primarily fattening country
for stores which have come in
from the N.T. and the Gulf, the
cattle fatten at an astonishing
rate, but the problem of walking
them out to railheads over dry
stock-routes is always there.
They can walk condition right
off on the journey in or out to
the channel country, and baby-
beef production under existing
conditions is out of the question.
The Cooper, in a good season,
can now turn off 21,000 fats a
year. Given a railway the three
rivers between them could, in
the estimation of Queensland
Bureau of Investigation of Re-
sources, turn off an average of
160.000 head a year, with a
maximum, in a good year, of
400.000 head.
They’re big figures in a world
crying out for meat, and, con-
sidering the time and expense
of running a railway in, which
would be tied up with questions
of gauges (40 p.c. of the fats
now go to Adelaide, 30 p.c. to
N.S.W.), it would pay Govern-
ments and land and meat in-
terests to take a closer look at
the diesel road-trains now at
work there.
Colostrum for Calves.
“Myrrhee”: Put the springers
into a well-sheltered paddock
near the house and away from
the rest of the herd. There they
can be kept under observatioa
See that the calf gets its first
feed from the mother and her
milk for the next four or five
days. Colostrum from another
cow may be too strong or too
weak, whereas the mother’s milk
is nicely adjusted to her own
youngster’s requirements.
This first milk differs from
ordinary milk, containing a
greater quantity of more easily-
digested protein (about 17 p.c.),
more minerals, vitamin A and
immunising substances which
protect the calf from infections
of the digestive system. After
five days the calf can have fresh
whole milk from any healthy
cow. Continue feeding whole
milk until the calf is two weeks’
old, gradually breaking it down
with skim milk until at five
weeks all the whole milk is
eliminated.
A. C. T, Hewitt, M.Agr.Sc.,
ih “Vic. Journal of Agriculture,”
gives these figures for feeding a
calf: First week, up to 121 b. of

Banana-land Erosion.
“Bill C.”: A check against
erosion of banana-patches' by
water would be cover crops of
some dwarf legume of the cow-
pea family. Such plants as
Poona cowpea can be estab-
lished merely by scattering the
seed on iightly-cultivated land
anywhere during summer. It is
in late summer and early autumn
that damaging rains fall in
coastal banana districts. With
the spaces between stools covered
with legumes, the water would
soak in better, and washing
would not occur, unless the
bananas were spaced along a
definite watercourse coming
down the-range.
When we grew bananas we
cut the grass, then cultivated
around the stools, and the cut
grass and refuse formed a sur-
face layer that encouraged the
rain to soak in. A legume cover
in a banana patch, lasting from
three to four months during the
rainy season, would scarcely
harm the bananas. If it rose too
high it could be slashed. It
would not rob the bananas of
plant food, being reliant on air-
borne nourishment. It would
stop erosion and weeds and, on
dying back, would supply
humus.
Contour Terraces.
“Nedrium”: At Dookie Col-
lege (Vic.). International Har-
vesters, the college and the Vic.
Soil Conservation Board set out
to show how it could be done by
using only standard farm
machinery. Six different trac-
tors and eight different cultivat-
ing machines .were used to level
the terrace and build and shape
the contour banks in a sloping
paddock. Three different types
of mouldboard ploughs, one
disk harrow and four disk
ploughs were used —the latter
generally being the most effec-
tive.
Two new devices were seen—
a hydraulic de-angling device for
an Bft. disk harrow (a pull on a
control rope can put on or take
off the angle of the harrows)
and a Whirlwind Terracer. This
last is not standard farm
machinery; it has a plough
mouldboard and coulter feeding
soil on to a revolving geared-
spiral that can work at either
600, 800 or 1000 r.p.m.
Although it does a neat job,
general opinion was that the use
of 28in. disk ploughs was most
effective and economical.
Water-pumps.
“Radian”: Before putting one
in, consider these points; The
suction-head—that is, the level
of the water to the centre of the
pump—should not exceed 22ft,
and on no account be more than
25ft. Full allowance must be
made in this figure for pipe
friction, a factor which can
lower permissible suction-head
considerably. An efficient foot-
valve should be fitted, except
where it is possible to use self-
priming by steam pressure or
motor-engine exhaust, or where
“’ Morniri ". Steve."
the pump is installed below the
water-level.
Avoid air-locks in the suction-
line by ensuring that the pipes
rise evenly throughout their en-
tire length. Suction-pipes should
not lie horizontally, or rise from
the foot-valve and then go down
to the pump ; which often hap-
pens when a bank of earth has
to be negotiated. Fit a union
or flanged joint at a convenient
point near the foot-valve so that
the valve is readily removable
for repair. I prefer flanges to
unions—they are easier to keep
airtight and cheaper to buy.
All pipe joints on the suction
side must be airtight and are
best made with a mixture of
graphite and boiled linseed oil.
Don’t use the elbows at all and
avoid bends as far as possible
—they create too much friction,
This applies equally to suction
and delivery lines. Support the
pipes so that they do not hang
on the pump, thus preventing
fractured castings and leaking
joints,
# # _
Penicillin and Mastitis,
“Billjim”: Penicillin is effec-
tive in the more common types
of mastitis, but has limitations
and must be followed by strict
dairy sanitation. This is stressed
by Veterinary Smith, of S.A,
Agricultural Department,
In using the drug, says Smith,
all instruments should be boiled
for 10 minutes. Boil some rain-
water and allow to cool, remove
metal seal from phial, pierce
rubber cap with hypodermic-
needle and inject 4 c.c. of cool
boiled water into phial. Shake
thoroughly to dissolve penicillin,
withdraw one c.c. of solution,
add to 4oz. of boiled water in the
bottle of the injection equipment,
milk out the quarter, swab end
of teat with methylated spirits,
insert teat-syphon, run in 4oz. of
solution and massage the quarter
gently. The penicillin should be
left in until next milking, when
the quarter may be milked out
as usual.
Smith recommends repeating
this treatment in 24 hours and
again in another 24 hours, using
the remaining 2 c.c. of solution
in 4oz. of water. Supplies may
be obtained from the Common-
wealth Health Department and
chemists,

Queensland Timber,
“Bon-Yi”; Here in .the Bris-
bane Valley some of the finest
farming land is under reserve
for Forestry plantations. Some
hoop-pines are over 50ft. high,
with a girth of 25-30 inches and
only 15 years old. Planted over
600 to an acre, the trees require
only attention for weed and
vine competition in the early
stages, with “sucker-bashing” by
brush-hooks to give them a
chance to develop quickly into
fine trees. Later, after a sys-
tem of selection is used to mark
off the best 120 or so crop trees
and pruning of lower branches
to a height of about 21ft., the
culls are available for thinning-
out.
The amount of serviceable
timber already available can be
gauged when the Forestry De-
partment recently called tenders
for the purchase by auction of
over 37 million square feet of
thinnings from the various south
Queensland plantations. When
it is estimated it takes Nature
about 700 to 850 years to grow
a hoop-pine in its native scrubs
to reach a girth breast-high of
60 inches and only 35-40 years
in a Forestry plantation, the
grouch against all the best lands
being wasted under trees loses
its point.
’ Now the thinnings, instead of
being marketed for timber, are
to be kept as a source of supply
for a paper-mill about to start
operations on the North Coast
line and close to extensive plan-
tations at Beerwah. Another
type of tree that has shown
amazing rate of growth in these
rich-soil plantations is the Syd-
ney blue-gum, or flooded-gum
(E. saligna). Planted on a
freshly-burnt scrub area, trees
have reached over 12 feet in less
than 12 months, with average
growth over Bft. Within six
years a test plot reached over
50ft. As a source of timber for
farms in suitable areas it stands
alone.
Stop Fleas.
“Bill C”: Where there is
plenty of running water handy,
no dog should be allowed to
keep away from it. If pups are
thrown into deep water they
will like it and go in of their
own accord later. Regular
swims keep them almost free of
fleas.
In dry, dusty country small
dogs become so heavily flea-
infested that large, reddened
areas appear on them, usually
on the back, and their health
and condition are affected. The
remedy is not kerosene, which,
though a great flea-killer, burns
the canine skin very painfully.
A good wash using a dog-soap
(household soap can cause skin
diseases in dogs) followed by a
dusting with insect-powder kills
fleas and prevents reinfestation.
A cheap and effective powder
contains 4oz. of naphthalene
and 12oz. of common starch, the
ingredients ground fine and
mixed by sieving. A drop or
two of pennyroyal or eucalyptus
oil deadens the naphthalene
odor.
Hints for the Farm.
“Plane Creek”: i Rats and mice
will come into the house during
the winter months, and a good
poison is barium-carbonate bis-
cuits. Cheap to make, they con-
sist of three parts by weight of
flour and one part by weight of
barium carbonate, mixed to-
gether with sufficient water to
make a stiff dough. The dough
is rolled out |in. thick and cut
into small pieces or biscuits,-
which are dried in the sun.
Watch the baits—they’re poison-
ous to human beings and
animals.
“Wilco”: Growing maize on
cane-land is a risky business,
frowned upon by sugar experts.
Reason is that maizs is often
affected with mosaic, a disease
that causes stripes and markings
on the leaves. Later on the
mosaic attacks the cane planted
on the land.
“Billjim”: A plain, effective
daily ration for 100 fowls is 61b.
of pollard (third of kerosene-
bucket), 31b. of bran (quarter
kero.-bucket) and 44b. of meat-
meal (half 30oz. fruit-tin). Wet
bran with half a gallon of hot
water (or hot milk if available)
and then dry off with the pollard
and add half a bucket of chaffed
green feed to make a full kero-
sene-bucket of mash. Ten
pounds wheat will do for the re-
mainder of the day.
“Malo”; New disease-resistant
potatoes have been evolved, the
best for coastal districts being
Sequoia and Sebago. Inquire
about the seed from the nearest
agricultural department.
“Myrrhee”; It isn’t the wound
but the infection that kills.
Don’t try to seal a wound in
an animal too rapidly or organ-
isms that have gained entry be-
fore treatment may set up com-
plications. Make sure there’s
an opening in the lower side for
drainage, even if it means en-
larging the wound, and cleanse
with a solution of 2 p.c. lysol,
4 p.c. boracic acid or 2\ p.c.
tincture of iodine. For wounds
near the eye use a safe non-
irritant such as boracic acid.
Stitch the wound, apply a dress-
ing and attend to the injury
daily, or, if necessary, twice a
day.
“C.A.A.”: Guard against in-
troducing noxious weeds when
buying pasture seeds by asking
for purity and germination cer-
tificates. Compare purity and
germination numbers on the cer-
tificate of analysis covering cer-
tified seed with the numbers on
the bags attached to the bags;
base buying on purity, germina-
tion and strain; see that bags
of certified seed are properly
sealed, that there are no un-
sealed knots in the twine and no
holes; in the bags.
“Moya”: Golden cassia is a
beautiful autumn - flowering
shrub suitable for hedge or
windbreak because of its low-
branching habit. If kept to
about 10ft. high it will form a
dense, bushy shrub. Seedlings
should be set out about 6ft. apart
(after frosts have gone) and pro-
tected by netting.
“Herbert”: Galvanised-iron
is worth all the care it can be
given these days. To prevent
roofs and walls from rusting,
mix whiting and linseed-oil (not
fish-oil) to form a workable
paste and add any desired color-
ing. Brush it on. It will pre-
vent iron from rusting for years.
It does not blister and peel off
like paint.
“C.S.”: Sydney R.A.S. is to
stage a show of poultry, pigeons
and caged birds at the Show-
ground on July 8-10, the first of
an annual series. The R.A.S.
and Black Leghorn Club have
taken over from the defunct
N.S.W. Poultry Club, and entries
close on June 5.

circles in the shape of the figure
eight. A big lump of a woman.
He never looked at her with-
out thinking of warm, downy
places, and he enjoyed his
occasional excursions to the
farm when, with his two cobbers,
Smale, the policeman, and Biggs,
the dog-man, he would take a
hand at poker in the dim front
room, and try over “Asleep in
the Deep” and “Old Black Joe.”
He followed them out to the
front door as they left.
“See you soon, my dear!
We’ll be out for a singsong end
of the week. Biggsy and Smale
and me.”
Flodie’s farewell smile was
guarded. “But I don’t think —
oh, all right then!”
“You don’t sound very sort
of welcoming to poor old uncle,”
said Gus as they climbed into
the cart.
“Why? Oh, that what I
said!”
Flodie laughed and. yawned
and was silent as they drove
back down the long country
road, the wintry sun on their
shoulders.
THE sun was still shining when
they got inside, and the birds
in the aviary were singing. The
sound seemed to fill the whole
house, to exude out of the air
itself, to be diffused so that it
flowed like water into every
crack and crevice, so that it
gathered itself up and poured
down again from every smoky,
fly-specked ceiling- the sharp
twittering of finches, the clear,
ecstatic notes of the wild can-
aries and the complaining mur-
mur of doves.
“Listen!” said Clem, and he
stood gaping.
After a while he moved to-
wards the aviary and stood with
his nose pressed against the fine
wire mesh. The blue budgerigar
came to him and he crooked his
finger and stroked its head. It
was an exquisite creature, its
feathers folded together like the
tiny petals of a flower, its little
face with the resolute curved
beak composed and knowing like
the face of some Jewish child.
Clem made a sudden kissing
noise with his mouth, and the
budgerigar muzzled his cheek
through the wires.
Those birds, I hate them,
thought Flodie angrily from the
kitchen door. She pulled off her
felt hat and the ridge where it
had rested showed hard and red
across her forehead. She dragged
off her shoes and flung them be-
hind her.
“I’m tired,” she said.
Clem was instantly at her side.
“You been on your feet too
much,” he said. “Are your
ankles swo’n, Flodie? Are your
ankles swo’n?”
“I don’t know, I’m just tired,”
she said complainingly.
Her tiredness persisted. When
Uncle Gus and his cobbers ap-
peared towards the end of the
week she had nothing to show in
the way of preparations beyond
a plate of ragged sandwiches
and a sponge cake that had sunk
in the middle.
The evening was a failure from
the start. The fire in the front
room smoked. The loose hes-
sian on the walls bulged in and
out with the noise of a flapping
sail. Uncle Gus laid his fan of
cards pn the table and blew a
song breezily through the fringes
of his moustaches, but Flodie
faltered in the middle of “Up
the Airy Mountain,” and would
sing no more.
“I’m done,” she whispered.
“Me voice’s gone on me. It
wants something to sort of back
it up. A piano like!”
SUDDENLY she burst into
tears and sat covering her
face with her hands, a big weep-
ing woman who jingled her
colored bracelets together and
gulped noisily like a child.
“She’s never been like this b'e-
fore,” stammered Clem, feeling
helpless.
“Nerves,” said Uncle Gus
owlishly.
“Nerves,” echoed the dog-
man. “Gets ’em all, big or little.’
“She’s all burned up,” said
Uncle Gus. He glared angrily
at Clem. “Time you got out of
this farm. It’ll eat
you down to the bone in the end.
What’s wrong with the pie-shop?
Flodie and you to take charge
and the snug little house at the
back. I had this in my mind a
long time.”
“Thanks, Uncle, but we like
it here,” said Clem kindly. “We
like it here, don’t we, Flodie?”
But Flodie, abandoned to her
weeping, was past caring, and the
men let themselves out the front
door, disappearing sheepishly
into the night. Clem got his wife
into bed, wrapping her in the
blue-satin dressing-gown that
had splits at the seams and a
stain of egg-yellow at the neck.
“It was my voice going on
me like that,” whispered Flodie,
staring up at the black reaches
of the ceiling. “I wish I had a
piano to give me confidence.
We’d best buy that one, Clem!
A piano gives style.” She sat up
and threw her plump apns round
his neck. “Oh, I’m a mean, sel-
fish woman, always wanting
something, always costing you
something! Chemists’ bills,
doctors”
Clem was silent for a long
time stroking her hair, but his
lips were moving, and Flodie
guessed) that he was doing some
figuring in his head.
“I been working things out,”
he admitted at last, “and we
could borrow what’s left on the
insurance. Fifteen quid for a
start. I dunno about the rest.”
“Oh, we’ll manage,” she said
in her deep, caressing voice, and
she went on sipping the cheap
brandy that he had brought, feel-
ing warm and Comfortable right
down to the soles of her feet.
THE piano fitted nicely into the
corner of the room. Flodie
kept it polished every day, and
sat picking out new tunes with
one finger. She was in top form
again and singing like a bird.
She was happy.
It was grand to see Flodie
happy, but. Clem was worried.
The spring was wet and it was
hard to get wood out of the
water-logged paddocks. There
were days when he did nothing
at all, and it was a case of no
wood no money.
Worst of all were those
weekly payments for old Isaacs.
Ten shillings, ten shillings, ten
shillings, how they mounted up !
Twice he had got behind and
Isaacs had come in person. Each
time he had made himself agree-
able, admiring the birds, shrewdly
assessing the price Clem had
paid for them in the beginning,
each time going away with the
money in his pocket.
It was a relief when the piano
was finally paid off, but some-
how there still seemed to be no
ready money available. After a
burst of warm weather, when
the garden tossed with purple
larkspurs, it rained again, and
Flodie, padding around in thin
slippers, caught a cold. There
was money needed for the
chemist, money for horse-feed,
money for groceries, money for
the mere right to stay alive.
He kept his uneasiness from
Flodie, but she was aware of it
one bright, windy afternoon as
he moved between aviary and
kitchen, whittling a bird-swing
from some wood. He was un-
usually silent, and his silence irri-
tated her, but not so much as the
finches’ singing. That rasping
twitter, twitter, twitter!
It made her want to scream.
And it made her want to scream
all the more because she knew
that the sound of that singing
was seeping through Clem, right
down through the pores of his
skin, and he was listening with-
out knowing that he listened.
Soon Clem started to whistle.
His task absorbed him. He was
thinking birds, dreaming birds.
She brought him back with a
laugh.
“Clem, do you want to go and
live with Uncle Gus?”
“My oath, no! ” He peered at
her standing in the kitchen
doorway, whittling at his stick.
“Do you?”
“No! That old fool!” Flodie
started to giggle and the yellow
curls bobbed around her neck
like little yellow cocoons. She
went on shelling peas lazily. “I
like it here. But, darling, what
are we going to do for money?”
“It’s only for a while,” said
Clem after a pause. “Just a little
bit of ready money to tide us
over we want —that’s all.”
Flodie looked at him, her blue,
cloudy eyes very soft. “You’d
better sell your birds,” she said
simply.
He stared at her, the color
draining out of his cheeks.
“Why not?” Her voice was
firm, and she went on shelling
steadily. “You know old
Isaacs will give a good price for
them. He said so. The whole lot
—aviary and all. I could grow
ferns there then. It would be a
good place. Tree-ferns and
that lovely curly maidenhair.”
He still stared. He felt that
he hated her because she had
said it first, because now that it
was put into so many words he
knew what he was going to do.
“I’ll see Isaacs,” he said, and
pushed past her roughly.
(‘ I T isn’t as if they really love
1 you,” said Flodie comfort-
ingly. “Not birds !”
She put her arm through
Clem’s and squeezed his elbow.
They were walking across the
wet, grassy paddocks towards
Uncle Gus’s shabby car. Clem
walked slowly, adjusting his step
to Flodie’s padding gait. He was
glad to be out of the house,
where the silence had been press-
ing on him all day like a smoth-
ering hand. The birds had gone.
Isaacs had come out the after-
noon before and taken them
away in his heavy truck, aviary
and all. The whole thing had
been accomplished with very
little trouble. The birds had been
quiet, all but the blue budgeri-
gar, who had kept, nibbling fran-
tically at the thin wires of his
cage . . .
“Yes, thirds,” said Flodie again
in her earnest voice. “They don’t
really love you! They take all
they can get from you and give
nothing in return. They’re
hungry all the time —asking to
be fed! More, more, more!
They clean you out and leave
you dry.”
Clem smiled. Flodie, bless her
heart! She was only trying to
be kind. She didn’t understand.
He grinned at Uncle Gus as the
old man propelled himself dis-
gustedly through the clinging,
wet grasses.
“This place, it’s a sin and a
crime! When are you clearing
out and coming to live on your
old Uncle Gus? How’s your
chest, Flodie? I tell you, boy,
you got a wife you got to take
care of!”
“I know,” said Clem humbly.
He stood looking across the
silvery patches of drowned
clover, across the dark secret
water coiling in between the
black-and-white stems of the
melaleuca bushes.
There was a sudden shrill
note of color in the water, a
knife-flash of blue. A bird was
flying over. It was the blue bud-
gerigar free as air. Clem
strained his neck watching. Now
it was a bird. Now it was merely
color. Now it was a speck, dis-
solving, disappearing, one with
the sky. Abruptly he turned and
walked hurriedly after Uncle
Gus and Flodie, and all at once
he knew that he was happy, and
at peaqe.

Insurance business. The Government, he
stated, had no intention of interfering
with the transaction of Insurance business

Quite Innocent.
“The Government’s only purpose
in retaining clothes-rationing was to
ensure the goods in limited supply
were fairly distributed.” — Minister for
Trade and Customs, Senator Courtice.
“It wouldn’t, by any chance,
have anything to do with the
Government’s reluctance to re-
linquish the opportunity to push
the people around, would it?”
asked the interviewer.
“That is„ absolutely furthest
from the Government’s
thoughts! ” declared the Minister
emphatically. “Besides, pushing
suggests a form of exertion, and
that is one thing of which
Cabinet can fairly claim, we
think, to be utterly guiltless. Our
aim has been quite clear since
we took office: less and less ex-
ertion for everyone. The true
socialist view is that one should
do as little as possible for as
much as one can get. I’m sure
nobody could, with justice, ac-
cuse any member of the Gov-
ernment of failing to put that
high principle into sincere prac-
tice. Remember the almost
painful sacrifice we made in re-
cent months in granting our-
selves a £5OO-a-year rise, thus
heaping upon some of us addi-
tional worry as to what kind of
business enterprise to invest the
extra money in so as to get the
biggest dividend. And don’t for-
get also our celebrated self-
abnegation in going into recesses
for several months so as to re-
store our flagging fibres.
“The ideal socialism we are
determined to usher in,” went on
the Minister as he warmed to
his subject, “envisages a State in
which no citizen is obliged to
work, for the true socialistic be-
lief is that man was not thus in-
tended by his Creator to waste
his time, especially when he can
spend it in pubs, at the dogs and
the races, etc. Which reminds
me that we hope shortly to re-
vive the highly-important night-
trotting industry. The plight of
the poor unfortunate book-
makers” —here he wiped away a
furtive tear—-“has moved the
Government deeply. But, pur-
suant to our unalterable belief
that everyone should bludge on
the Governmeilt from the nap-
kin to the shroud, we are deter-
mined that the proud human
dignity of utter dependence on
his socialist masters in power
shall be the inalienable right of
every citizen, especially in our
determining what is not to be
good for him. Remember, there
are numbered among our ex-
alted hierarchy high intellectuals
—superb billiard-markers, bril-
liant engine-drivers - cum ■ war-
strikers, etc, —who”
“Yes, yes,” interrupted the in-
terviewer, “but to get back to
rationing. Retailers unani-
mously protest that their stores
are bulging with goods which
the public has the money but
not the coupons to buy. The
suggestion has been made that
the Government retains ration-
ing only to keep an army of
civil servants occupied to get
their election votes nfext year.”
“That ridiculous claim,” the
Minister protested with almost a
sob in his voice that such a low
suspicion against highminded
politicians could be held, “the
Government flatly denies. We
don’t ask rationing employees to
stay. They are at liberty any
time to resign and work for a
living. Nor do we intend to in-
fluence them in their voting in
any way. We have got pictures
of picks and axes and fruit-can-
ning benches here and there, and
“You wouldn't clap like that if I Were
up there making an exhibition of
myself !”
someone has brightened the
walls with a cartoon of Bob
Menzies burning a colossal pile
of ration-books. But to say we
intend to bring pressure to bear
on temporary employees who
hope they may become perman-
ent is patently absurd
“Some people,” pursued the
Minister, “drawing conclusions
from the fact that more adults
are now employed on rationing
schemes and at greater cost than
during the war —after all, we’ve
been at peace now only just on
three years, and these things take
time to eliminate —expect the
figures to leap month by month,
with a huge increase just before
we go to the polls.
“Certainly we will appoint
more adult clerks, but that it is
as a vote-catching stunt we
vehemently deny. It is, after all,
in keeping with the best socialist
practices when work on a pro-
ject slackens off, as rationing ad-
mittedly is, to appoint more
rather than retrench as do profit-
hungry private concerns. That is
the secret of our successful
building-up of bigger
and better deficits
in all Government-
run affairs which has
so distinguished our
holding of office.
Members of a cer-
tain party which pur-
sues a certain politi-
cal philosophy
quite legal, of course
—and which is giv-
ing us stout support
in the present refer-
end u m campaign
assure us that our
system is little in-
ferior to that of the
certain Power from
which it takes its
orders,
“However, revert-
ing to rationing,”
concluded the Minis-
ter, “our detractors
conveniently over-
look the striking re-
duction in rationing
personnel that we
made quite recently,
when the services of
several junior clerks were dis-
pensed with.”
“Something has been men-
tioned about it, and it has been
acclaimed in some quarters as
indicating a change of heart by
the Government. But as junior
clerks they wouldn’t have votes,
would they?”
A look of synthetic surprise
slowly seeped over the Minister’s
features. “Well, what do you
know! ”he exclaimed. “We had
never thought of that!”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND

Stamps for Dollars
Britain is commemorating the Royal
Silver Wedding anniversary by the issue of
special postage-stamps of two values —
and £l. The was selected be-
cause it is the foreign postage rate, and
will therefore achieve a world-wide dis-
tribution. The £1 stamp was almost cer-
tainly chosen with an eye on dollars.
There are probably some 10,000,000
active stamp-collectors in the U.S.A., and
the stamp trade there is big business.
Exports of these British commemoratives
to the dollar area, including Canada, will
be substantial.
Australia also could do with a few
more dollars, and our P.M.G. might well
follow Britain’s example. We are, for
instance, to issue commemorative stamps
when the King and Queen visit us next
year. A little preliminary organisation
and publicity would ensure big sales in
America.
At present, to control the transfer of
funds in this form, the sale of postage-
stamps to dollar areas is restricted to
dealers under licence, which means that
American collectors must obtain our
stamps through trade sources and pay
the dealers’ profits. v
If the Government would make Aus-
tralian stamps easily available at face
value through, say, the Department of
Information Agency in New York, and
advertise the fact in the American phila-
telic press, a host of small collectors would
certainly avail themselves of the service.
The dollars thus acquired, and the profit,
would fall directly into the Government’s
hands.— Kell (N.S.W.).
Broadcasts
By what right does the Federal Gov-
ernment force the whole radio-listening
population of Australia to hear its loan
quiz? The total cost of this “amuse-
ment” and the prizes .so generously
donated by the Government are all paid
for by us.
We were all indignant when Hitler
forced all Germany to listen to his utter-
ances ; our present Government’s be-
havior isi not much better.
This nation-wide broadcast is supposed
to speed-up the flow of hdrd-earned sav-
ings into the coffers at Canberra. I
doubt that it has much effect. — Fair
Play (Vic.).
Whatever his political beliefs, I ad-
mire Mr. Menzies as a most able orator,
one with the capacity to weigh matters
in their true light and present his judg-
ment in a clear and simple manner,
I was, therefore, most interested to
hear his broadcast talk on the referen-
dum, and was listening carefully when
his summing-up was abruptly terminated
—as far as the radio audience was con-
cerned.
Surely, since we are forced to hear the
loan-“quiz” broadcasts over all stations,
arrangements could have been made to
give this talk in its entirety. After all,
the referendum can affect our lives more
gravely than can the music which fol-
lowed Mr. Menzies’s speech.— Herr
Sauer (S.A.).
H.M.A.S. Sydney
Although H.M.A.S. Albatross, the name
of our old seaplane-carrier, seems
appropriate enough for the naval air
station at Nowra, it is a pity the memory
of cruisers Sydney and Melbourne was
not perpetuated in new ships of their own
class, instead of giving their names to
aircraft-carriers. The 6in. cruiser is now
the standard cruiser in the Commonwealth
navies, and sooner or later our 20-year-
old 8-inchers will be replaced.
There are no two ships more widely
diverse in their functions than cruiser and
carrier. With the name Sydney firmly in
Australian minds as the cruiser that sank
the Emden, and her successor the cruiser
that caught Bartolomeo Colleoni and
later disappeared in one of the war’s
most tragic sea mysteries, the name should
be retained for her own class. — Macnell
(N.S.W.).
Timber
I couldn’t help a derisive snort when
I picked up my morning paper and read
yet another item on the present timber
shortage. My property on the North
Coast of N. S. Wales carries enough
timber to last for. 10 years—several mil-
lion feet of good Australian hardwood —
yet when I tried to start a mill the lack
of encouragement from the authorities
made me wonder if there really was a
shortage of timber.
First, the local millers had to be con-
sulted as to whether I would be stealing
their labor, etc. —where’s the free enter-
prise there? Next, inspections were made
and I submitted my application to the
local forestry office for a sawmiller’s
licence. From there it was sent to the
forestry head office, and, since I was
assured that there would be no hitches
in granting the licence, I installed my
plant.
The weeks went by and nothing hap-
pened. Growing impatient, I went to the
forestry headquarters in Sydney. There
a languid youth told me not to worry—
the licence would be through in no time.
I made six 300-mile trips to Sydney in an
effort to hurry things along, and even
then it took five solid months to get my
licence.
Now I have only to wait for the local
council to bring me the electric power.
That, by the way, has been “coming”
for 18 months.—C. P. D. (N.S.W.).
At the Uni.
Our Sydney University is a strange
place. It has been visited by Lord Wake-
hurst, R. G. Menzies, Dr. Evatt and many
other prominent men. Each creates a
little stir for an hour or so, then the
Uni. settles back to the even tenor of
its way.
This time, however, it was different.
Two weeks before the big event, word
“You'll have to pull it down hard, dear—it sticks a little."
went around that he was coming. At
first no one believed it and everyone
thought it to be another of those prac-
tical jokes. But the rumor was not
scotched and a notice appeared in the
Veterinary Science school confirming his
visit.
On the day of the visit, the lecture-
room was overcrowded beyond even
Sydney University standards. Students
sat in seats, on benches and on the floor,
or stood in the aisles and doorway ; they
crowded round the little man, whose first
words were, “Of all the funny places I
have been in, this is the funniest.”
The little man was Maurice McCarten,
jockey and trainer, and the subject of the
lecture was “How to Train a Two-year-
old.” —F, F. J. (N.S.W.).
“Road-trains”
If “Transporticus’’ (B. 28/4/’4B)
watches his newsreels in Singapore he’ll
see Australians loading and carrying cattle
on a diesel road-train from a NT. station
to Alice Springs, the motor hauling three
to five trailers holding up to 100 head of
fats. The trip was 14 hours, as against
as many days by droving.— C. Punch
(N.S.W.).
Ten or Fifteen Years!
“The Prime Minister said today that
he believed there would be no major war
for 10 or 15 years.” Even if Mr. Chifley
should be right, what a travesty of hope is
offered us —no golden age dawning, but
merely another 10 or 15 years in which
to prepare our bodies and souls for a
conflict which must be more universal,
more merciless and cruel than that we
have just endured.
Ten or fifteen years! Parents who, on
Anzac Day, mourned their older sons
can now count their 10- and 12-year-olds
being ripe for the next slaughter. Young
ex-servicemen, who escaped death once,
and who are now poking up their careers
again, studying, marrying and building
homes, will still be young enough to die
in battle. If not them, then their sons —
and wives and daughters, too.
We struggled out of the abyss in 1914-
18 only to fall back into it in 1939-45.
Surely not again!— Hist (N.S.W.).
Housing
Two years ago, on being discharged
from the Navy, I returned to my home
town with my wife and two children. We
searched without success for a house, flat
or other suitable accommodation, and
were finally obliged to hire a tent on the
local camping reserve.
Six months later the Housing Commis-
sion began building ten cottages (on the
boggiest site in the town) and announced
that these would be balloted for in the
usual fashion. We put our name on the
list and were duly allotted one of the
cottages. It was to consist of three rooms,
kitchen-living-room and offices, and the
understanding was that it would be ready
within a few months.
We are still in our tent. We have no
water laid on and all our cooking is done
on primuses. We don’t even save on the
deal because, although we fire paying a
very low rent, our food consists mainly
of grills and tinned stuffs. We have no
hope of preparing economical dishes.
We are not the only ones suffering
through the delay. There is another
family in a neighboring tent, another
with two children in a shed and a fourth
family is in a tumbledown block of flats
that has been condemned and is shortly
to be demolished.
The Housing Commission has been
building those 10 houses for 18 months,
and still they are not completed. We
have received no correspondence about
our cottage, and do not know how much
rent we will have to pay. Neither do we
know when we will be able to take pos-
session. One of the men working on the
job told me that they were held up for
want of four baths and that no one can
move in until all the houses are com-
pleted. I hope he’s wrong.—l. R. D.
(N.S.W.).
Navy Recruiting
Current Navy recruiting advertising is
unimaginably dull and uninspiring ; more
so when one considers the wealth of
matter advertising men could use with
effect. A bald statement announces that
seamen, signalmen and stoker mechanics
will be accepted “over 17 \ and under 24.”
Nothing of the work they would do—sea-
men coxing fast motor-boats, spinning
dits on a stage painting ship’s side, firing
guns from rifles to Bin., shooting surf in
a whaler on a tropic lagoon, fishing with
lines and depth-charges and T.N.T.
blocks, hauling ships off reefs and feel-
ing that indescribable comradeship of
half-a-dozen of you ashore in a foreign
port.
Signalmen hauling whipping flags to
the yardarm of a 36-knot destroyer in
flotilla manoeuvres, the captain relying
utterly on their interpretation of the
leader’s signals. Stoker mechanics, 40,000
leaping horses curbed by a turn of their
wrists, with experience ranging from great
steam turbines driving 10,000 tons at 28
knots to diesels, auxiliary machinery and
motor-boat engines.
A bandsman’s advertised qualifications
are “able to read music and play one in-
strument.” Nothing of leading 2000 men
in a march; parading all glitter and
sparkle and stamping feet on a holystoned
quarter-deck to receive an admiral; or,
most important of all, crouched over in-
struments in that most amazing part of a
warship’s complexities, the nerve-centre
of all turrets, the transmitting station.
These are a few enticements the Navy has
to offer, and they should be advertised.
For recruiting purposes, present ads. are
about as useful as a Navy in Switzerland.
—Jemac (Q.).
Dancing
Annual church conferences have
brought the usual crop of arguments as
to ,whether dances should be promoted
under religious auspices. Both sides are
handicapped by their inability to use
plain physical and psychological terms
available to mere laymen when discussing
the subject in private.
When R. J. Campbell’s “New
Theology” Fas being headlined one
caustic critic said: “It is not theology,
and it is not new.” In the sarne sense
the modem terpsichorean technique of
shuffling and cuddling is not dancing, and
it is not new, though the habit of doing
it in public is a recent development.
Boy meets girl on a polished floor, and
within a few minutes they are hugging
each other openly and unafraid, all their
senses stimulated by accompaniments
that are deliberately composed, com-
pounded and designed to stir passions
that are perfectly natural but are neither
spiritual nor saintly.
If it is the object of the church to be
popular by being all things to all men,
then such rhythmic exercises may be
permissible. But if its object is holiness
then so-called dancing must be omitted
from its “procedure,”
Dancing is not necessarily sinful, but
it is exclusively sensual, and should be
left to promoters who make no pretence
of abjuring the world and the flesh. —
Jitterbug (S.A.).
We Can Take It
“C.V.’s” third guess (B. 28/4/’4B) is
closest —Mr. Chifley “is cynical enough
to think that by the time the Courts have
done with the banks case the people will
have forgotten their hostility.” We do
forget too quickly and forgive too easily.
Take Mr. McKell. About a year ago
the country was hot under the collar and
verbally excited by his “impudent” ap-
pointment as G.-G. Nowadays even
Vaucluse and Toorak would gladly shake
his hand, particularly with the Royal visit
in the offing.
Or take taxation. Not long ago we
were all cursing Mr. Chifley and his
world’s record tax-grabbing; now the
worker with his fictitious wages and the
merchant with his blackmarket and quota
system seem utterly indifferent. It is
merely a matter of presumption, persist-
ence and patience on the part of poli-
ticians. The present Administration at
Canberra exploits that formula as a fine
art —P. O. M. C. (N.S.W.).
For the Egg Board
I’ve heard many tales such as “M.G.”
(B. 21/4/’4B) tells, but as we, too, supply
eggs to the board I can’t help being
doubtful when “fresh eggs” bring such
poor returns. The board is not perfect;
its employees are human and they are
bound to make mistakes, but I have found
it just, in the main. The itemised report
accompanying each cheque shows why
payment is poor or otherwise. Last
month, for instance, one cheque was ss.
lid. clear for. three dozen eggs.
On our farm poultry is a sideline, and if
we have doubts about any eggs we never
send them to the board. Eggs are
gathered twice daily, and soiled ones
cleaned with steel-wool. Though by no
means model egg-producers, we rate over
90 per cent, “first-quality hen” —occa-
sionally a whole consignment (11 dozen)
will be “export quality.”
Last December, in one lot of 21 dozen,
three eggs were graded “blood-spot and
bad,” one “broken and useless,” and
eight “second quality.” As the board had
made a rare slip in calculation, crediting

(Several similar contributions include a
“press statement,” headed “Egg Board
Hits Back,” in which “The Egg and Egg
Pulp Marketing Board of Victoria”
stoutly defends itself and its eggs. Of
the eight dozen eggs for which a Victorian
farmer’s wife received a cheque for five-
pence, the board reports that “not one
was sufficiently good to be placed on the
local market and only three out of the
eight dozen measured up to the Govern-
mental requirement for processing into
best-quality pulp.” The board further
asserts that it does not “aim to put the
small egg-producer out of business—
but is vitally interested in ensuring that
only top-quality eggs are placed on the
local market.”)
Where did that poultryfarmer cash her
cheque for fivepence? Banks do not

amount to less than 10s. —Mac (N.S.WJ.


the series of rushing triplets in the final
presto to a fine climax was a nice study
in the dynamics of the keyboard.
Of Chopin’s shorter works three
waltzes —of which the one in G Flat was
outstanding—the A Flat Major Im-
promptu and the Scherzo in B Flat Minor
were gems of delicate artistry combined,
in the scherzo, with fine depth.
Perhaps there was nothing happier
throughout the four recitals than
Schumann’s “Carnaval.” From the festive
air of the Preambule, with its suggestions
of Mardi Gras in full swing, to the
martial air of the Davidsbundler with
which it closes, Miss Joyce infused into
it the spirits of gaiety, of nostalgia, of
witty comment, of coquettishness, of
.dreamy poesy which chase each other
through this captivating piece.
Among other works with which the
pianist delighted huge audiences were the
Beethoven Sonata Op. 27, No. 2, which
Rellstab so fatuously titled “The Moon-
light,” though both the allegretto and
presto conjure up visions of storms rather
than lunar beams on Lake Geneva; the
“Pathetique” Sonata, notable for the
splendid serenity achieved in the Adagio
movement; Mendelssohn’s Rondo Cap-
riccioso, Op. 14, Liszt’s Concert Study
in D Flat Major, Brahms’s Rhapsody in
G Minor, Op. 79, No. 2 —through which
flowed a strong undercurrent of sadness'
—and Granados’s “Maiden and the
Nightingale,” in which much of the
tragedy and passion evoked by the works
of the painter Goya were captured, shot
through with Spanish color and rhythm.
They consisted of everybody who
could get there. They had too
many ancillaries and were very much
top-heavy. They were whittled down
to 22,000-23,000 from May onwards.
Of these, an average of about 15,000
were Australians, 500 Indians and
the balance British. The Australians were
raw, half-battle-trained, fresh from their
first experience of active war, in which
they had been chased tens of miles in
dark and dust, shot over, bombed,
strafed. They had seen their comrades
killed, but had scarcely fired a shot them-
selves. The British provided the solid
core of battle 'experience.
The young, hardy Australians manned
the outer reaches, did the raiding in bril-
liant fashion. Neither section let the
other down.
Lavarack and Morshead inspected the
30-mile outer perimeter. Then they laid
out Tobruk. There was to be an outer
Red Line manned by seven of the gar-
rison’s 13 battalions. It consisted of
stone-sangared posts at intervals backed
by reserve companies in cemented posts,
half a mile back. The 26th Brigade had
the west, the 20th the southern; on that
which covered the road making for Bardia
and Solium the 24th lay. The 18th
Indian cavalry was near the sea to the
west. The 24th Brigade had only two
battalions until May 4, when the 2/32nd
turned up. The sea was defended by the
Navy. There was) little air-cover. The
sky was wide open.
Australian Methods
Each post bristled like a pirate ship—
mainly by courtesy of the Italians, who
were to have many a taste of their own
bitter medicine. Germans who came up
to the line beheld, perhaps, a dozen de-
termined, ragged figures. Some had
tommy-guns, anti-tank rifles. Italian
47mm. Bredas were popular. Machine-
guns of various types barked in various
tones.
Then if the enemy advance continued
—perhaps some well-armed and -ordered
party to establish a bridgehead for the
tanks came up —there would be a gleam
of steel. Some of the dozen would rush
breakneck across 200 yards of flat desert.
They would go down, take breath. The
line behind them would have stopped
its support fire. A shout would go up
from the charging figures as they rose for
the last relay. Their comrades would
shout as well. And in a few moments
nothing would be visible but bloodstained
bayonets, writhing figures in the blasted
sand and some too-hurried German
struggling on the wire.
This little scene came to be enacted a
hundred times. Its prototype was de-
veloped during Easter when young
Mackell, of Sydney, a beardless boy,
naturally battlewise, stalled off the first
German attack in just this way and lost
Jack Edmondson, who won, then, the first
V.C. of the Second A.I.F.
Just now such events were pending,
while Lavarack and Morshead laid out
their defences. Not satisfied with the
gallant outer A.I.F. shell of the Red
Line, a second line (the Blue Line)
was laid down two miles inside
the outer perimeter—strongposts, exca-
vated, mined, wired, each holding a
platoon (as near as may be), 500 yards
apart, with a continuous minefield and
plenty of barbed-wire and support from
anti-tank and m.g. The brigades forward
usually left one battalion in this line.
Behind this there were the field-guns (the
25s sometimes firing h.e. point-blank, hav-
ing no a.p.)—about three to a mile of
outer perimeter to be covered —and the
ack-ack which sometimes became anti-
tank. And there was a mobile lorry
brigade, like no other in history, except on
the Russian front. It covered the cross-
roads with a.t.-guns on light lorries, and
there was a mixed pack of armored-cars,
Bren-carriers and tin-cans which were
described by courtesy as tanks, ready to
go into action against seaborne invasion
of parachutists.
Wherever there was space there were
mines. There were so many mines in the
end that nobody quite knew where they
were. Tobruk was called a fortress. It
was—to almost the last interior inch of
it in the end.
As if this were not enough the infantry
itself acquired its own artillery along with
some of the strangest gun-crews of the
war; old Italian guns, mostly without
sights, operated by teams some of whom
had seen a gun and a few of whom had
actually hauled one. Thus, the enemy
rolling confidently up with new 22-ton-
ners, might find barring his path an
ancient Italian weapon manned by some
ardent infanteers commanded by a trans-
port wallah who had learnt his gunnery
the day before and who had the most
original idea about orders.
“Cock her qp an inch. Bill,” he would
say, squinting along the dirty, sightless
barrel. “That’ll do her. Let the blankard
go.” And a perfectly good Mark 111 up
the road, all unconscious of the original
processes leading to its immolation,
would stagger, roll and burst into flame.
“No Dunkirk Here!”
There was not much air-cover after
the first few days, but this did not
affect the spirit of Tobruk, which was em-
bodied in Morshead’s words: “There will
be no Dunkirk here.”
The Germans tasted this -spirit early in
those nights of Good Friday and
Easter Sunday when they made their first
attacks. It was plain that the reason they
had not flung their great concentration of
tanks at the town was that Rommel was
not the man to use a sledgehammer to
crack a nut. He was saving his striking-
force for the happy day when he should
break open Egypt and take demoralised
Tobruk in his stride. Out of that stride
he came in Easter, 1941, with a much-
scratched and very red face and a badly-
stubbed toe. He made his attack so con-
fidently that the assault-party even
brought its office files along so as to be
able to settle down after the walkover.
He had given Tobruk nearly a
couple of days’ grace. Then, when
General Gott had gone away to
the border and Tobruk on April 11
was sealed up except by sea, Rommel
prepared to strike on Good Friday on the
2/17th sector of the south, sending down
messages from the sky at an appropriate
time that “single soldiers waving
white handkerchiefs” would not be fired
on. There were many surprises waiting
for his men. The one thing which, the
Italians had not left behind in store
seemed to be white handkerchiefs. Mac-
kell’s bayonets steamed. But the greatest
shock of all came when, in the night, the
Germans broke through the outer peri-
meter, rolling over the wire and the in-
nocuous Italian-dug anti-tank trench be-
tween the outer strongposts, calling, as
they went, instructions to the strong-
posts they passed as to methods of sur-
render. They penetrated deeply, confident
that once they were through the perimeter
all was over with the British in Tobruk.
Then, with daylight, hell opened on
them and on their footslogger supports
coming up in their rear. The absurd
Italian-gunned lorries skithered furiously
over the desert at them from the flanks,
flung a few rounds at them point-blank
and went off like giraffes. The deadly 25-
pounders caught them over open sights.
The inner and outer strongposts, the weird
scratch artillery—everything which could
draw a bead on them —pounded and pep-
pered them until they went back helter-
skelter, running for their lives. Rearing
and bucketing in clouds of dust and in
the smoke of blazing tanks, which was
filled with an inferno of every sort of
fire known to man, the supercilious
Afrikakorps ran away, literally, a rabble
which Australian officers had difficulty in
preventing their men from following de-
risively into the desert. The fugitives
paused desperately, to hitch their big
guns outside because the crews had been
killed, but Tobruk’s strange artillery was
after them in a trice, and they were
forced to abandon them. Then the mop-
ping-up started with the bayonet for obsti-
nate parties on the perimeter. And all
this had gone on under a canopy battle
in the air and cheek-by-]owl with an
attack on the harbor and ack-ack by the
Stukas and Ju 88s.
Of 38 tanks which got inside the wire
17 did not get out. The Germans left
12 burning aircraft, 110 men killed and
254 prisoners. One company of attackers
alone lost 10 tanks and five 75mm. guns.
But Tobruk lost only 20 killed and 60
wounded, 12, missing, two tanks and a
25-pounder smashed and a couple of air-
craft shot down.
Tobruk Goes to Ground
Lavarack went away to assume his
Western Cyrenaican command, which he
could not exercise in a beleaguered town,
and presently was in Syria. Morshead
took over. The garrison settled down to
one of the most curious and desperate
sieges in history of modern war. While
the pressure on the fortress was left at
the first to Italians, more formidable
under a German command than under
such heroes as General Electric Whiskers
Berganzoli, the real incessant battle went
on in the air. Everything in Tobruk was
carried through to the drone and squeal
of the dive-bombers, the whistle of bombs
and the rat-tat of answering automatics
and artillery. In the first three weeks of
April, 1941, the place suffered 52 raids
by nearly 700 aircraft apart from attacks
by hundreds more on the perimeter.
And this was only a beginning. It was
much worse later.
It was bombed, battered, blasted day
and night at all hours and in all seasons,
while in the open, flat desert outside the
German and Italian tanks roved in packs.
now massing for a determined battle, now
going quiescent and wishing they had
never seen the Australians, who, from the
moment they organised themselves,
adopted the theory of aggressive defence
—a theory which involved continuous
raiding against their besiegers, continuous
practice with their weird and sightless
guns, continuous ingenuity to trap a
simple and unwary foe, and continuous
practice of the art of never letting him
get off the alert and of showing them
the bayonet and the grenade which he so
much dreaded at every opportunity.
The Major Battles
The major engagements which lent
variety to this routine were of two kinds.
There were, firstly, the battles of April
30-May 3, the battles of the “breach” due
to German initiative or Australian
counter-initiative. There were the two
attempts of the British to relieve Tobruk
on May 15-16 and June 16-17. There
was the Australian attack which failed to
retake the German salient in August.
But always there was the bombing, of
which the crescendo was reached when
Rommel launched nearly 150 aircraft
against the devoted town on September
1, 1941 ; and always the harrying of
the besiegers.
The Australians raided and they and
their British comrades dug and dug, some
went bomb-happy, some died. They
wrote lying letters home saying that
everything was rosy, how good the cricket
was and that the band played every day
and that it was a lovely life though lived
under a canopy of air attack, of which
the ceiling was pushed high by the ack-
ack, while Brigadier L. E. Thompson’s
peerless 25-pounders -kept enemy artillery
on the ground at a respectful distance.
The Navy’s Part
Tobruk would nev,er have lived through
its ordeal if it had not been for the Navy,
which kept the door open, which brought
in supplies, ammunition and reinforce-
ments and petrol on demand, and rescued
the wounded. The Navy took punishment
as it came and gave back better than
it took —ships like Parramatta and
Waterhen, Vendetta, Stuart, Vampire,
Voyager, Napier, Nestor, Nizam, not to
mention Pedlar Palmer’s schooner and
others which kept the “spud run.”
In August the first Australians were
taken out. They had been virtually in
the front line continuously five months.
The Eighteenth Brigade, which belonged
to the Seventh Division, the Sixteenth
Anti-tank Company, some other small
units and the Eighteenth Indian Cavalry
and the Fifty-first British Field Regiment
went away. These made space for the
Carpathian Polish Field Brigade Group,
which arrived in the third week in August
and which, beside introducing new and
savage techniques into the fighting, also
brought a social polish and a standard
of manners which were certainly strange
to Tobruk.
In September, the Twenty-fourth
Brigade Group was replaced by the Six-
teenth British Brigade Group, and the
remaining two brigades of Australians
went out on several dark nights in
October, less than three weeks before the'
British counter-offensive began. This
evacuation was one of the most thrilling
operations of the campaign.
A German Christening
It was the Germans who christened the
defenders of Tobruk “rats.” “Caught like
rodents in a trap,” Berlin Radio used to
drawl. But even the 2/13th, the last
rearguard to leave the Er Regima
Escarpment, the last of the A.I.F. to go
from Tobruk (where they had been left
behind to provide General Scobie with
a highly-experienced battalion), lived to
fight again and to recall, after another
and equally fruitful encounter with
Rommel just a year later, the glorious
fight when in the British break-through
at the end of November they—the
only original A.I.F. left in Tobruk —
were let out under the command of the
indomitable Burrows in the bright moon-
light to retrieve El Duda and make the
relief of the fortress a fact.
Including the withdrawal from Ben-
ghazi, the Siege of Tobruk from March
till November cost the A.I.F. 726 dead,
2057 wounded in action, 61 missing and
951 prisoners—-in all 2000 fewer than
Alamein. Never did casualties pay more
handsome dividends.
The fortress acted like a ball and chain
on Rommel’s leg throughout the months
while the Eighth Army’s counter-offen-
sive was being prepared. It provided a
new second flank from which he could
be assaulted when it came to dealing with
him.
And the effect of the defence on Ger-
man morale, the fear of Australian
bayonets which it put into the hearts of
the soldaten, was worth half an army
corps at Alamein and elsewhere.
In more ways than one it was the
turning-point of the war in Africa, even
despite the fact that once more the Ger-
mans were to surge across the Egyptian
frontier before they were destroyed.
N.S.W. Junior Orchestra
and Choir.
An admirable feature of Professor
Carl Sauer’s direction of the N.S.W.
Junior Orchestra and Choir is that he
grounds them in the solid tradition of
great music. It was no surprise that the
programme he presented at the Sydney
Con. should start with Beethoven’s
“Egmont” Overture. Although the tempo
was sometimes a little ragged—some of
the less-experienced youngsters tend to
forget the importance of the conductor’s
hand —it was, on the whole, a noteworthy
effort. The minuet from Haydn’s “Queen
of France” Symphony, Carl Sauer’s own
arrangement of Schumann’s Nordic Air
and of Bach’s “Arioso,” Mackenthun’s
“Tango Funebre” and Rubinstein’s
“Kamenoi Ostrow,” which had to be re-
peated—these constituted a severe test.
They were generally of fair calibre, with
some nice work by the higher strings.
With a tighter attack and elimination of
“dragging” where all four sections come
in together, the orchestra’s playing
should reach a high junior standard. The
choir achieved a nice balance of voices
in Mozart’s “Ave Verum,” Bach’s “Jesu,
Joy of Man’s Desiring” and the largo
from Dvorak’s symphony “From the
New World,” all arranged by the con-
ductor. June Stidwell sang the Waltz
Song from “Romeo and Juliet” and
Marie Nunney “I Love Thee,” by Grieg,
both with judgment and sureness.
Aboriginal Show
Wirth’s Olympia was packed from floor
to ceiling by white Australians when a
Bulletin man attended the all-aboriginal
show the other evening, the first of its
kind in Melbourne. The cast, drawn
from the furthest confines of the land,
was probably as surprised as he was.
The entertainment led off with a
swaggie lost in the Blue Mountains. Hav-
ing failed to light a fire with his last
match, he falls asleep on an ancestral
corroboree ground, and out of the
shadows the tribe emerges, makes fire
without the assistance of Bryant and May
and dances a fire-dance, after which the
swaggie wakes much surprised to find
his fire blazing.
Then a ragamuffin crowd, typical of the
abo. of the compounds, comes out, the
girls squat down and start playing poker
and the men start a game of two-up. A
brawny young man is a consistent loser,
and, while he is losing his Government
allotment at two-up, his lubra is losing it
all over again at poker. The scene closes
with a free fight. This was probably the
contribution of Mr. Onus, a Melbourne
aboriginal actor and spokesman for his
fellows, to illustrate the degradation of
the natives when he comes in contact with
white men.
One thing the affair showed was that
-the abo. is a natural actor. It only re-
quired sufficient numbers to make the
fire-dance into an impressive ballet. A
prima donna sang Arunta folk-songs as
well as sentimental European ditties, the
singing cowboy from Westralia twanged
the banjo and sang indigenous ballads
known at every campfire, and a gum-leaf
band raised an enormous uproar which,
if not exactly on the same note as the
Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, was a
surprising achievement on such a simple
apparatus.
