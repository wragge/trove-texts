The Red Page
A Vanished Year
Reckless hearts of a vanished year,
Spendthrift friends of a day long dead !
What was the counsel we would not hear?
What were the words the wise folk said?
These were the words they used to say
(Time, the tester, has proved them right) :
“Young Bones, go gather the wood by day
That old Bones may have warmth by
night!”
Life was lovely, and youth was good,
Hill and hollow were bright with flowers ;
Why should we search the land for wood
When all the wealth of the world was
ours?
Now that the winds of winter rage,
Time, the tester, has proved them right.
Hark, how they howl, "the storms of age—
Spendthrift friends, we are cold to-night!
N.S.W.
RODERIC QUINN.
At the Aonian Power Station
The mountain slope grew steeper and rougher
as I ascended. 1 was now something like
5000 feet above the HSgean ; but a blue haze
shrouded ail the east, and the Corinthian
Gulf to the south was shut off from view
by the summit of the mountain itself. Here,
on the very breast of Helicon, |t was im-
possible at the moment to feel the classic
inspiration of the surroundings; but the
heat and the weight of my knapsack had
made the climb too much like a mere athletic
feat ..to preserve any of the poetic illusion
which the very names of the sacred place
should have called forth. To imagine that
the Muses still lived here, contented in a
remote wilderness of rock and scrub, was
to rob them of the fine intelligence which
they once possessed. With a choice between
ivatoomba and this barren peak, Thalia must
be a fool— —
“She’s not quite so foolish as you think.”
I suppose I had spoken my thought aloud,
but to hear it thus answered made me leap
to my feet in some confusion.
“Hello!” I cried'. “Where on earth did
you spring from?”
Her eyes smiled a whimsical little smile.
“Just now,” she said, “I’m staying with
some friends on the mountain. Not very-
long ago I was in Sydney.”
“Staying on the mountain!”
“res. We’re what you would call a
scientific party. Some very important work
is done here, though the secret has been
well kept.”
A scientific party on Mount Helicon! The
glory of the land had indeed departed.
“Uh,” I said. “I suppose you have located
Aganippe and Hippocrene?”
She laughed. “You passed Aganippe hours
ago. They use it to wash sheep. Hippocrene
is half-a-mile to the north and a little higher
up the hill. We bring it in pipes round
the shoulder of the mountain, and it is our
main water supply. You can both drink it
and bathe in it if you will be our guest.”
I thanked her for the invitation, and
hoisted my knapsack. Together we climbed
up the rough slope until the mountain-top
was in sight.
"If we hurry we may be in time for part
of the lecture,” said my guide. “After that
you must dine with us. We are a homely
little party, but you will be among friends?.
We have always a Welcome for those who
climb Helicon. As you know, it is a pretty
stiff’ ascent, and the way is not attractive.
“But is there no better path?” •
“You found the only one- there is.”
We turned a corner so swiftly and came
upon a door so suddenly that my imagina-
tion played me a curious trick. I suppose
it was. the Greek air aud the Greek setting,
nut I could have sworn that when my eyes
first locked into the porch the doorkeeper
was posed there in the nude. Instantly the
illusion was gone; and I saw her in white
blouse and dark skirt, a pretty fair-haired
girl with nothing in the least Hellenic about
her in either form or feature.
My companion whispered to her, and then
beckoned me to silence. On tiptoe we passed
through, the heavy hanging curtains and en-
tered the lecture-room. On the platform
stood a tall lady in an academic gown of
palest blue, and about lier were jars and
while at the back of the room were
machines which suggested electric appliances.
A dark girl at a little table to the speaker’s
left was using a typewriter. Below the
plattorm a dozen girl-students were taking
notes.
"These mental forces,” said the lecturer,
who seemed quite unaware of our entrance,
are poisonous. By poisonous I mean that
ioft uncounteracted they must destroy the
human vision. Let us take, for instance,
the work of the writer Bergishimer. He is
>' e by the formula (W965+M3N2)
x oL<B II.”
She wrote the letters and figures on a
blackboard.
“This formula, as you will see, is danger-
ous in combination. Words, waste or with-
out special significance, stand in a propor-
tion of 965 to every three of real force and
meaning, and to every two necessary for the
progress of the narrative; and the whole
is multiplied by shock to the conventions to
the power of 78 minus H—the H standing,
as always in such formulae, for the sense
of humor as understood on Helicon. You
will see that the separate ingredients in
Bergishimer are in themselves harmless; it
is in combination that they become poison-
ous. I might have used as an example the
niore deadly mixture of the Norse dramatist,
Pipson, or the fascinating, but not wholly
destructive, literary beverage of Shaw O’Ber-
nard ; but I prefer to deal at once with the
complicated American product. I have here
two jars, prepared for this lecture, contain-
ing two literary products in solution. One
is the simple antidote, Keats, which we use
for its reactive power on all ordinary pseudo-
poetical poisons. A stronger antidote is, of
course, Milton; but Milton, like Sophocles,
is not wholly satisfactory when applied to
inferior poisons. As a general (antidote
we find Keats best. The second jar"—-here
she held aloft a muddy, greenish liquid—
“contains the reduced essence of Bergi-
shimer. Now, I will ask you to watch the
experiment.”
Carefully she unstoppered both jars and
poured about three drops of the Keats liquid
into that of Bergishimer. The change was
remarkable and instantaneous. Prom a dull
green the American liquid changed to pale
blue.
“You will observe,” the lecturer said, “that
the liquid has changed, but is not yet pure.
Translated into human terms, that means
that any mind which has absorbed a little
of the spirit of Keats is proof against the
Bergishimer poison to the extent represented
by this change of color; but mark the further
effect of the antidote.”
She poured two additional drops from the
Keats jar into the pale-blue compound and
held both the liquids up for inspection.
“Pure,” she said; “absolutely pure. The
antidote has entirely counteracted the poison.
You might drink of this without any ill
effects. Translating the experiment again
into human terms, this shows that, to the
mind which is once really influenced by
Keats, Bergishimer, far from being poison-
ous, is a mere nothingness, an emptiness of
words without force or influence. Later on
we shall apply similar tests to work of
another nature; but for the present we shall
deal only with the application of this. It
must be clear to you all that we can no more
supply the human mind with the direct anti-
dote in liquid form than we could lay on
the water of I-lippocrene as a general supply
for London, New York or Sydney. Instead,
we use the force of the brain-wave.”
She went to the back of the platform and
pulled a lever. A faint singing, low but
melodious, filled the room.
“That lever,” she said, “connects with
the - main power-house. Brain-waves of
Keats are now directed upon the English
midland counties, producing exactly the
same, effect on minds coming into contact
with them which was produced in the experi-
ment I have just shown. Our older methods
were, as you know, in the nature of distant
flights and continuous whisperings; now -we
use modern system and modern power. Our
influence is in direct relation to our electric
supply ; and our control of the human mind
is so far slow and limited.”
She ceased speaking, and my companion
touched my sleeve.
“Let us go,” she said; “the practical de-
monstration is over, and she is now going
to deal with purely technical things,”
I started as if from a dream and tiptoed
through the curtains.
“I am astounded,” I said. “The Muses
are still alive —alive and modernised. I
couldn’t have credited it.”
“No?” she said, with a whimsical smile.
“Why, then, did you climb Mount Helicon?”
“The Muses are alive!” I repeated, pinch-
ing my hand to feel that I was awake.
“Very much so.”
“And you are?”
“Oh. I’m small potatoes among these seri-
ous ladies. I’m Thalia,”
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
The Tree of Knowledge
In every part of the world where man
takes thought for the morrow, or says that
his wife or his neighbor should, even if he
takes none himself, the approaching famine
in the above-mentioned vegetable begins to
be talked about. Permanent and portable
knowledge is based on the printed word, most
of which is temporary foolishness; and print
is based on paper, and the tremendous de-
mand for paper is now almost wholly sup-
plied by cutting down the remnant of the
softwood forests which Nature planted, and
which man mostly forgets to replant. By
reason of the time limit this is a serious
matter. If the world omits to pl%nt suffi-
cient wheat, with the result that there are
scarcity, high prices and profanity to-day, it
may decide that there is a fortune in wheat,
and make a blackguard rush to plant too
much next year, the result being super-
abundance, unpayable prices and more pro-
fanity to-morrow. But the tree-crop takes some
25 or 30 years to ripen. In the dreary inter-
val of forest-restoration, the issue of the
poet’s license may have to be suspended or
restricted to poets sworn to write only coup-
lets and located in districts where the flow
of verse is scarce ; and it may be necessary
for books and newspapers to be strictly
rationed. This would naturally lead to the
brewing of illicit literature. But everything
apparently leads to something, and. that,
when arrived at, is generally the cause of
something else.
The last century and a quarter has been
a period apart and an orgy of flesh. In
countries where reliable census records go
back to 1801, wlien the census habit began,
the general result of possibly misguided
science and probably misdirected, philan-
thropy is that the population has increased
fourfold in lands which habitually, send out
emigrants, means that four times more
human overburden was piled up on this earth
in little over 100 years than in all the mil-
lion or billion ages before.. In countries
which habitually received immigrants the
increase was as much as 30-fold —3000 per
cent. Something of the same sort lias hap-
pened even without immigration, and as a
mere matter of natural increase. In some
primitive places where the mild little brown
woman has no dissipation except the baby
habit and the occasional worship of an idol,
she used to have ten infants,, of whom eight
died, so population was stationary. She is
as small and mild and brown as ever, and
she still has ten infants; but,, mostly as a
result of white supervision, eight of them
survive, and white & officialdom begins to get
a dazed feeling in the head.
So in the regions where the most wonder-
ful supply of soft timbers used to grow there
were, all of a sudden, 30 times the old lot
of people, all clamoring for accommodation
for themselves and their slums and their
wheat-fields and their factories. And these
people got into a habit of demanding each
30 times —or it may be 100 times —the
old quantity of yellow literature, all made
from trees, that their ancestors were satis-
fied with. In the course of two long life-
times man used up the greater part of the
trees over the greatest forest region the
world possessed, and all the buffaloes, and
practically all the Red Indians, and a very
great deal of the oil, and likewise, in his
haste, he went to sea and consumed most of
the whiles, and almost enough of the seals
to make a seal famine. The pace is growing
faster instead of slowing down, and the close
of the century is likely to see very many
people, most of them superfluous in the
sense that they live to no visible end except
that of being dead later on, and a great
scarcity of many things.
Last year Australia paid away £4,250,000-
for imported softwood, and nearly the same
amount for foreign paper made out of wood,
or, -say, £8,000,000 in all. It will probably
pay £16,000,000 20 years hence. A
little later it may * find itself in the
blessed position of paying nothing at
all, because the very few countries which
now, have softgoods to sell will be
running short themselves, and will rigidly
prohibit export on the ground that preserva-
tion is the first law of Nature. Then money
will no more buy paper from abroad than
it will buy pterodactyls—that is to say, it
won’t buy blank paper by the ton to print
the S. M. Herald on, but it will buy a cer-
tain quantity of paper, retail, at a high
figure, with the New York Herald already
printed on it. Therefore, there'will be no
S. M. Herald for many years, or possibly
for ever, and the press generally will perish
like autumn leaves. Occasionally a tree
may be smuggled in, but timber is a bulky
article to smuggle, and in any case one tree
doesn't go far.
Some nations intend to be ready for the
day of shortage, and are planting the Tree
of Knowledge with extra energy, but the
betting is anything to one that Australia
won’t be ready. A nation that never yet
saw a. loan falling due in the sense of doing
anything to meet it save trust in luck isn’t
of mubh account at long-distance industry.
In Prance about per cent, of the sur-
face is under forest, all tended with the
utmost care, and there is talk of raising
the tree-crop to cover 25 per cent. But Aus-
tralia will probably lay the foundation-stone
of its first real paper forest on the day
when the S. M. Herald ceases publication,
Austin Chapman performing the ceremony
at Canberra. After which the said forest
will be attended to with the same deadly
persistence ns a State sinking fund.
If Australia planted 1,000,000 acres of
softwoods per year for 25 or 30 years, and
tended them carefully, it would have
25,000,000 or 30,000,000 acres by the time
the first crop was ripe. So it could cut and
replant 1,000,000 acres per annum and begin
to have an income. Even then it would have
less timber than France possesses and much
less than France intends to possess, and con-
sidering what the population of Australia
should be in 25 or 30 years, the planting ot
2,000,000 acres per year would be. none too
mufch. There should be many widely-scat-
tered forests, for soap-box orators of a certain
type will assuredly do their best to burn
them down in the name of freedom .of speech.
Wherefore the practice of incendiarism on
them should be a capital offence. Also re-
prieve should be barred, else the first Bol-
shevik Government will bring a Judge from
Tasmania or Solitary Island to find that all
parties concerned, and especially the worst
ones, ought to be released and compensated,
on the plea that every person is innocent
till he is proved guilty, and also afterwards.
With all this new planting, which should be
combined with reasonable care for the old
hardwood forests, and with a system of ad-
ministration absolutely unlike anything any
Federal Government has done for the last
10 years, the S. M. Herald might not need
to suspend. Otherwise nothing can save it,
and its grave might as well be dug right off
to furnish a job for the unemployed.
A forest under scientific management is a
sort of factory, inasmuch as it is an effort
to produce wealth by skilled labor, and it
is almost the only factory with no uncouth
brown chimney attached. It is an incentive
to poetry, which can’t feed on the dry, tree-
less plains for ever. It would be a sinking
fund, provided some fool-Government didn’t
raise a special loan on it, for the tree which
is put in officially this year will probably be
the one thing the country has accumulated
against the loan falling due in 1950. A large
and generpus forestry programme should
tend to the preservation of the ’possum and
the native bear, which should find a blessed
sanctuary among 50,000,000 acres of timber,
and the extinction of these creatures would
be a grievous pity. It should have the, more
doubtful merit of helping to preserve Binghi,
the aboriginal, .who might recover some sem-
blance of his original wildness among the
timber. It is the custom to state, as a self-
evident proposition, that Providence will be
very mad and hot under the collar if Binghi
isn’t preserved,- though wffiy it didn’t make
him a* more desirable and preservable article
is never explained. Forestry should appeal
to the Australian (at least to the Australian
of legend) when he gets used to it. by reason
of the happy, peaceful, restful interval be-
tween the sowing and the reaping. It isn’t
a hurried business like growing lucerne,
vffiich sometimes indecently disturbs the
silence with five crops a year. And it would
be a blessed change to go in for producing
something for which there is an urgent local
demand, such as cotton for our cotton mills,
and flax for our linen mills, and trees out of
which to make our own daily paper.
JAMES EDMOND.
Over the Rail
Possibly the “Red Clover” paddock is re-
served for stableboys, trainers and profes-
sional riders of Pegasus; still, there cannot
be much harm in an outsider from the salt-
bush and mulga leaning his arms on the top
rail and making a few remarks.
First, I would like to say “Thank you” to
Hilary Lofting for a recent article on Hugh
McCrae—“My unicorn, my unicorn is dead.”
It brought to memory the pathetic ballad
composed (or, rather, “made up”) by Jerry,
the drovers’ cook, on a dry and dusty trip
from Eromanga to “the Buller.” The poig-
nancy of the refrain has been greatly
admired
Yer arsk fne why I sorrer,
Why life is all forlorn.
He poor old. Slimpy’s pizened,
Me cattle dorg is gorn.
There are 17 verses in the ballad, and the
chorus is repeated between each. Jerry
used to sing it between camps, but we stopped
him doing it at night.
I know of another Outbacker, Jack Jones,
who was so aggrieved at the frequency of
the notice, “This is a private road. Tres-
passers will be prosecuted,” that his. out-
raged feeling found vent in an anarchical
hymn condemning the squatters. It came
straight' to the point in the' first two lines
with 1 :— 1 *
And can’t the fools that wrote it
Read the writing on the wall ?
But as fine lines as ever were written on
the Western man I heard, or, rather, read, in
manuscript, in a di’overs’ camp:—
For they’ve breathed the fragrant sigh that breaks
from the lips of the waking day;
And they that taste of that magic are bond of the
West for aye ; .
They’ve heard the sound of the summer rains, the
songs on the river bars,
And read the secrets told at night to the world by
the flashing stars.
Really, sometimes one feels inclined to
think that Pegasus takes an occasional run
amongst the brumbies of the West, in spite
of trainers, touts, jockeys and all those
others who have (in their minds) marked
the boundaries of poetic inspiration by the
areas of the cities.

THE BLUEGUMS’ PICNIC.
MRS. WILTED BLUEGUM: “Just look at ’em, my dear. Girls weren’t such shameless hussies, I’m sure, in our time.”


Old Colonial Days.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
BY Campbell town lang syne 1 knew
An early home o’er which there grew
A spreading vine. A cornflower’s blue,
A peony,
Or pinks and fuchsias, red and white,
Will still recall, the years despite,
That grey old haunt of Youth’s delight
In dreams to me.
And when 1 hear the magpies sing
Their high love-carols in the Spring,
I see that great wistaria swing,
Soft, to and fro.
Its drooping weight of flowers fair
That spill an incense on the air,
Like censers from an altar where
The lights burn low.
On low verandahs cool and wide,
In dreams again I sit beside
A white-haired dame, who turns the tide
Of memory
To days gone by, and tells her tales
Of “good old times” in New South Wales.
When bluff-bowed vessels brought their mails
Across the sea.
And at her feet would muse a maid.
In print or muslin white arrayed.
• Who • (ay- dr mi!) was gently laid
Beneath the hill
So long ago! But grand-dam old
And sunny girl with heart of gold,
If you could know how dear I hold
Those day-dreams still!
Aye, yet those tales of Bond and Free,
Of ’Thirty-nine and ’Fifty-three,
They stir the native blood in me,
As up and down
Tn dusty summer, winter’s cool,
My fancy rides by flat and pool
Tlie road that runs through Liverpool
To Campbelltown.
Green wheat-fields through the clearings
glowed.
Green maize in paddocks by the road :
Long bullock-teams, with high-piled load
Trailed onward slow,
While gigs and coaches, fours-in-hand,
'lhe pick and pride of all the land,
Dashed by with shout or loud command.
In pomp and show.
With “Y'oicks !” and with “Tally-ho!”
The riders of the Hunt Club go—
llow well they ride the dingoes know
When o’er the bills
Of Cumberland their master heads.
By gullies, slopes and reedy beds.
Ilis die-hards on their thoroughbreds
To distant kills.
In taverns dim lewd draymen sang
On Brickfield Hill. The smithy’s clang
Across a crooked highway rang,
Where hoofs must be
To steel shoes wed, ere travelers fare
Beyond the city’s outskirts, where
The bold, bush outlaws deftly dare
The gallows-tree.
To Appin and to Fiction ride
The swaying coaches in their pride,
Or toil a steep Blue Mountain side
To Weatherboard.
The near horse neighs, the leader stamps.
Out in the night their gleaming lamps
Flash past the huts and sawyers’ camps;
But at the Ford
A lonely shepherd hears the clash
Of wheels on pebbles, and a splash
Of midnight hoofs that slip and thrash
A crossing deep;
Then sogging forth, with sudden clank.
Spite steaming breast or dripping flank,
They halt where lifts the further bank
Its rampart steep.
From blankets warm a convict lout
Has heard a distant horseman shout,
lb knows that Derven Jack is out
To work his will
From Windsor flats to Oampbelltown.
On all the highways up and down,
Though all roads lead but to the crown
Of Scaffold Hill.
Now watch and purse, now chain and ring,
Reluctant fares are forced to bring
To light. Thev pass each precious thing
At last to him.
But Captain .Jeuks, Colonial Foot,
His angry face grows black as soot,
When ’neatli his chin is rudely put
A pistol grim.
For Captain Jeuks above bis port
On last club night, the wags report.
Had vowed to cut uncommon short
This rogue’s career.
His red-coats and his peelers, sooth,
May snarl and search with fire and ruth
The country-side—this shameful truth
The world will hear!
f*
And, though they raise a line and cry,
To-morrow morn the news will fly
How Derven .Jack laughed loud and high
And blithe and terse;
Gave Captain Jenks a sweet “Good day”—
“And should your honor pass this way
Again, you’ll have —I hope you may—
A fatter purse!”
Thus sped the roving, roaring days,
Top-hats, wide skirts, cravats ablaze;
Old manners, old colonial ways,
That might not last;
The pints o’ brandy, blackcap rum,
The sodjer, fife and kettledrum,
With ribald Sals and lifers glum
Are with the past.
O’er lines of steel, worn hourly bright,
Fast railway-trains, ablaze with light,
Go roaring through the still bush night
From S.vdneyside;
The lamps of landward cities glow.
r l’all bridges span the floods below.
They may not wake, they may not know
Where’er they bide,
The pioneers of South and West
Who bravely bore, the worst and best,
Their banners on—to find their rest,
A rugged band,
They blazed the tracks we tread to-day;
They suffered, struggled, led the way
From Phillip’s camp by Botany Bay,
Throughout the land.
And, native-born, we shed no tears
For these rough, rowdy pioneers ;
We know their worth, their early fears,
Their later ways.
The men who stormed Gallipoli
And showed in France what men may be
Were just the heirs, like you and me,
Of those old days.
VICTORIA.

Innocence.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN first I knew him ex-police-ser-
geant Angus McNeil was a frail,
white-haired old man, living with
his crippled wife in his own cottage at
Waverley. Like all old folk they talked
mostly of the past, and many a strange story
he told me of the good-and-bad old times.
They both seemed to like my visits: I was
a good listener.
When Jessie McNeil died I went to her
funeral, a touchingly simple affair, and
walked back with the old man to his cot-
tage : her illness and death had broken him
up; he was failing in mind as well as body.
We went into the '‘parlor,” a stuffy little
room overcrowded with cheap furniture. Its
walls were covered with quaint photographs
of a dead generation—side-whiskered men
standing with crossed legs in affected atti-
tudes and tinted ladies whose amazing
“bustles” and busts certainly justified their
heightened color and wild blue eyes. Over
the mantelpiece one modern photograph
hung by itself—a soldier in khaki. Above
wa ® a scroll, on which was printed:
' Donald McNeil: killed at Gallipoli, 1915.”
lie was their only child. Of his life as a
devoted son and gallant soldier I had long
since heard all they had to tell.
When the old man was settled comfort-
ably in his corner, he pointed to the vacant
armchair opposite. I hesitated.
"Sit down, man—she won’t want it any
more !”
lie sat with bowed head while I talked
~f. everyday things, hoping to distract his
rnind from its lonely grief. I asked him to
tell me more about the illicit still he had
once discovered, cunningly hidden in the
Bishop s Court grounds, under, the very nose
of a total-abstaining bishop, ’but he would
not respond. At last I told him a true
story of long ago—a story only I could
tell —about an imaginary pal called Bill who
got tangled up with a girl, and as I went
on I saw. he was listening. So I gave him
every thrilling incident in that hair’s-breadtk
escape from fearful scandal—not sparing
Hill—until the old man leaned forward in
his chair, his face alight with interest. He
shook his head with profound sympathy as
I dwelt on the injustice done to the ‘girl,
and nodded with infinite understanding as
I stressed the male point of view. Sud-
denly. a thought seemed to strike him—he,
too, had something to tell. He Was rest-
lessly waiting for me to finish. 1 finished.
He began very slowly, as though the story
were forcing its way out through other
thoughts.
“There was a young tram-conductor l
once knew on the Waverley ,line —long ago
-your story reminded me of him. It's
curious, his name was Bill, too.”
He paused, peering at me. I stared back.
“Well, Bill was a fine boy—everyone said
so. He was a crack junior football-player
and didn’t know what fear was. He was u
THE LIMIT.
“Surely, Aunt Margaret, you're not going
to wear your spectacles in the water?"
“Indeed I am! Nothing shall induce me to
take off another thing."
favorite on the trams, too, with his cap on
the back of his curly head and a laughing
way with him even when he was collecting
the tickets. Bill always had plenty to say
for himself.
“The girl—never mind her name—was a
pretty, delicate-looking little thing, quiet as
a mouse and good as gold—l’ll swear to
that. Good as gold she was, I know. The
real facts of the case never came out, but
a whisper went round Waverley, and the
Department ordered me to make inquiries
and send in a report.” He stopped, lost
in thought.
“And you sent it in?” I prompted him.
“What? Oh, yes—the report—l sent it
in. It was confidential, of course. I sup-
pose it’s still filed somewhere in the Criminal
Investigation Department. Just the bare
facts, but”—his voice rose —“there’s often
a terrible lot behind facts—what was I tell-
ing you?”
“About the girl.”
"Oh, yes! Good as gold, but there’s not
a doubt she was crazy on Bill: girls often
get: that way about men they have never
spoken to. Why, she cut his portrait out
of a sporting paper—but I’ll tell you about
that later. Well, for months she was miser-
able if she didn’t see him every day, just
a glimpse, as his tram passed. Mind you,
he didn’t know her from a bar of soap, but
it’s queer how girls find out things about a
man they’ve taken a fancy to —things they
want to know. She knew his trams and the
different times he went on duty, and siie
found out that one week every month he
OH, QUITE A SUCCESS!
“Is your next-door neighbor a successful hostess?”
“I should think so. Why, dearie, she covers the cost of her supper-dances with her win-
nings at bridge.”
came home by the 11.30 tram after signing
off for the night at the Paddington Depot.
So she made some excuse to her mother about
a sick friend at Paddington. She really had
a friend there she went to. She was truth-
ful—for a girl—and night after night she
caught the same tram home with Bill. Well,
what could you expect? llow could he help
noticing her —-dolled out to kill —with Inn-
great blue eyes staring at him as if she was
mesmerised—can you blame him?” Dust
flew from the padded arm-rest as he brought
down his fist.
"Certainly not.” I spoke with convie-
tioft founded on a minimum of neglected
opportunities ; but he was not satisfied.
“But wouldn’t any young man have done
the same? Wouldn’t even you have done
the same?”
That insulting “even” stung me into put-
ting all the banked-up fires of 50 into 1
reply. “To he sure, I should —every time.
No harm in that!”
“Wait a bit —there’s more to come.” He
lay back in his chair and shaded his eyes
with his hand, all his aggressive animation
suddenly gone: indeed, his slow speech and
gentle tones now suggested that he was
dwelling, not on the criminal folly of a
stranger, but rather on some tender memory
of his own youth.
“I suppose it all happened so quickly
because they were both really so inno-
cent —just like two young birds mating.
Queer thing innocence; it’s sometimes worse
than guilt in this guilty world. If they had
both been bad no harm would have been
done, but just because they were both so
good there was the devil to pay. Well, one-
night he worded her. It was natural she
couldn’t speak—all flustered and breathless
and her eyes shining and her hand cold and
trembling when he took it. But the strange
thing was he was struck dumb, too—him,
that was so light-hearted and quick with
his tongue—always ready with his back-
talk- —he had hardly a word to say for him-
self ! But, somehow, their hands got clasped
on the seat between them, and there they
sat all the way out:, just looking at one an-
other and looking away.
"When they came to her stop he helped
her out and said he’d see
her home. God knows
that was the only thought
in his head at the time—
just to see her home. It
was 12 o’clock, and the
street wa s deserted.
There was a late moon
over the sea —they could
hear the breakers on
Coogee beach. They
walked along very
slowly, like in a dream,
with his arm round her
waist, until they came to
a dark shadow—the first
dark shadow. There —
they kissed. God knows,
it was an innocent kiss,
a s innocent as tli e
billing and cooing of
doves. After that they
walked—slower than ever —and kissed—in
every black shadow. They never spoke;
they couldn’t —it was all too wonderful for
words. God!” —it was a bitter cry: he had
quite forgotten me. and went on quavering
his thoughts aloud. “Why shouldn’t the.}
dawdle on that one short walk when life
was so beautiful and Heaven so close —with
Hell waiting at the end?” His face hard-
ened ; he straightened his thin shoulders —
once again lie was prosecuting-sergeant in
the police-court. “I’d like to ask where God
was when those two innocents reached the
cottage-gate, and kissed once more, and she
managed to gasp ‘Good-bye’—the first word
she ever said to him, and hardly breath for
that; her little hands pressed on her heart—
like this.” He pressed his withered hands
on his breast and looked down at them with
strange gentleness. There were tears in
his eyes; his voice was broken as he looked
up and said: “Just like that, your Worship.”
I began to fear for his mind.
“Mr. McNeil”
“Silence in the court!” he shouted.
giving my evidence on oath —and who the
devil are you, anyway? Who is he, Jessie?
The boy himself swore she was utterly inno-
cent —the very first words he said to me.
I’m not shielding him ! He sinned, and he
suffered —he was so young and masterful,
and his blood was up. As they parted he
whispered he would wait and see her later
at her window.” McNeil’s forehead was wet.
the veins on his temples knotted, but I
feared to interrupt him a second time lest
worse might follow his present frenzy. Hi*
voice, expression and gestures were so vivid
that he made me see, as with his staring
eyes, those two children as they kissed
good-bye in the yellow moonlight. He
hurried on in gasping whispers.
“She knocked softly at the front door.
Her mother let her in. He watched round
the house till he saw a candle lit behind a
blind. The window was open a few inches
at the bottom; it was left open—all right.
Jessie! You think she didn’t expect
him, but you’re wrong, Jessie—you’re
wrong!” lie peered towards me. 1
sat still and silent; “When the candle
went out he crept in through the gate—took
off his boots, hid them under a shrub, pushed
up the window, climbed in.” There was
terror in the old man’s face. I could hardly
catch his whispering, he was re-living every
throbbing moment as though he were Bill
himself.
“He whispered her name twice—ver-y
soft-iy—just like that. But she did not
reply. He groped till he found the foot of
the bed” —claw-like hands groped blindly—
“and felt his way along ii”—gnarled fingers
trembled over an unseen counterpane—“till
he found her hands, clasped tightly on her
breast. lie bent, down in the darkness and
kissed her lins. She was breathing very
fast” —the old man was sobbing, his words
came in broken gasps—“and as he kissed
her she cried out 'Donald’— in such a happy
voice—and gave a little shudder.” He
stopped ; his dim eyes stared round the room ;
he frowned as he slowly repeated—“as he
kissed her she cried out”
“ ‘Bill !’ I shouted.”
“Jessie! Did you speak. Jessie?” He
was dazed, he pressed his hand to his fore-
head. I knelt beside him, my arm firmly
round his heaving shoulders.
“You were telling me about Bill—when
he kissed the girl she called out ’Bill’ loudly.
Just like that — ’Bill!’ And then you dozed
off to sleep; lie back now and rest.” But
he clung to me, searching my eyes, until in
his I saw the storm-beaten mind fluttering
back to its place.
“Oh, it’s you . Yes, I remember now —I
forgot Jessie had gone. I was telling you
about—did 1 say Bill? He was a brave
hoy. Well, when he kissed her she sud-
denly cried out” —- —
“ ‘Bill!” I was taking no risks.
“Don’t interrupt!” lie said pettishly.
“ ‘Bill!’ in such a happy voice—l underlined
‘happy’ in my report. Well, he whispered to
her very gently and soothingly, but sue lay
quite silent and still. Soon he got fright-
ened. He could not feel her breath on his
lips nor her heart under his hand. He
struck a match —her eyes were staring, but
not at him; her lips were white. He jumped
to the dressing-table to light the candle, but
the match was burning low, and went our
as he caught a glimpse of his own portrait
in a gilt frame” —he stopped for breath.
“Don’t tire yourself any more —I can
imagine the rest.”
“Can you ! Can you!” There was chal-
lenge—triumph—in his cracked voice. "Well,
I don’t think you can! God only knows the
boy’s thoughts as that match went out. He
must have been terribly terrified just because
he was so innocent —he had only to drop
through the open window and away, and no
one would ever have known, but”—the
cracked voice suddenly rang deep—“he never
hesitated. He found the bedroom door,
opened it, shouted into the dark passage
‘Come quickly ! Come quickly !’ There was
a sudden thump of bare feet; a light gleamed
-—her father and mother rushed towards
him. ‘She’s ill—l’ll go for the doctor !’ he
just said that, and jumped through the win-
dow. He came back all right—he was never
a liar, never a coward. It was a long run
to the doctor’s—in his socks —but he was a
good runner; so was the young doctor, but
Bill beat him coining back. Bill’s toes were
badly cut about —his socks were past darn-
ing, but his mother kept them, .till she died.”
“And the poor girl?”
“She was dead—heart failure the doctor
said in his certificate; he never knew any-
thing; her parents and Bill kept quiet—
what could they say without tainting the
girl’s memory? All the same, the doctor
was wrong—she died of happiness, with
innocent complications.”
“Yes, indeed- —and Bill ?”
“He never got over it. It wasn’t his guilt
—it was his innocence—that spoiled his life.
He never married —the best of sons—never
forgot how his parents had stuck to him. I
could tell you a lot more, but I’m tired.
What do you think of Bill ?” lie asked sharply.
"I’d be proud to call him my son.”
He patted my arm with a delightfully
knowing smile. “Just what Jessie and I
said to one another many a time. If we
hadn’t had Donald for a son we’d have
liked one just like Bill. I think I’ll sleep
now till Mrs. Williams comes to get mv
tea —thank you ; good-bye.”
DOWELL O'REILLY.


Treacle and Bleat.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
FRANK PORTER, entering the Cara-
vanserai in the Street of Magic, saw
a Score of men meeting, talking for
a moment and running aWay from one an-
other without waiting for replies. They
apparently traded between two ports—the
Port of Possible Managers, or Probable
Financiers, and the Port of Actots-Waiting-
for-a-Job. To the fnanagers or the finaiu
ciets they gave a little more conversational
attention than to one another, but even with
them they were restless, going and return-
ing aimlessly, like ants whose home has been
entered by a Stick with a mischievous human
boy at the other ehd of it.
“Why ail the excursions and alarums?”
he asked of Whaley, who stood regarding
the actors and smiling at his own interest
in thelUi
“Movie-picture hankers. 1 was here yester-
day When the hive started to buzz. There*S
a hew angel blown in.”
“Who is he?”
“A farmer frbm somewhere round Dubbd.
He*s betrayed a faint interest in picture-
making, and the enthusiasts are providing
the rest. They want him to put up the
money to hiake a picture—five thousand
pounds they’re asking for. You know how
quickly news travels in this street—like
bush telegrams, smoke-signals, rtiulga-wires.
This farmer Caine down for the Agricultural
Show, and he won a prize with his bull,
Since then he*S been so proud that he sets
up the drinks for everybody. So the chaps who
want a financier to produce their pictures
are bainping on his trail. There are half a
dozen of ’em, each trying to steal him from
the other. Bbt for ali the whisky he takes
he looks hard-headed enough for all of ’em.”
“Half a dozen? Blit Who afe the other
excited ants?”
“Actors waiting fbr one of the managers
to land the angel. The fat chap there is
Mcßorie, actor and author too. Come and
have a drink and I’ll get him to talk.”
Whaley got Mcßorie to talk because
Mcßorie was waiting to talk. He accepted
the invitation to drink, and then told them
he was on good business at last; that the
angel farmer was his and also his heirs,
executors, administrators and assigns; that
in that very hand of his he held the finest
scenario ever written—his own. On the
evidence of these prospects he gently but
firmly attempted to borrow a pound, but was
successfully repulsed, and asked to drink
again.
Mcßorie was in no way abashed by the
refusal; he accepted the drink, and talked
on. This was in itself proof, as Whaley
remarked later, that he had failed in the
matter of the loan. Had he borrowed he
would have made a graceful exit, remarking
“Meet you to-morrow.” thereby signifying
that they should see his face no more. But
he was a sportsman; and, being refused, he
bore no ill-will. Instead, he told them
of the works of that interesting writer —-
himself.
“Of course, I’m not a poet,” he said as
an oblique compliment to Whaley; “but my
experience ns an actor has given me the
technique of stage-writing.”
“I know,’' said Frank Porter. “When
you’re gravelled for words, and you think the
scene will play long enough, somebody fires

a gun and kills the heavy man, and the
curtain falls.”
“No,” replied Mcßorie, very good humor-
edly, “not exactly that; but I can take some-
body elso’s work and disguise it. I wrote
‘Joan of Verdun,’ a war-picture, in six reels.
We did it all—Amiens and Verdun and
Poperinghe and the burning village—out at
Bondi; used Nurse Cavell for a thousand
feet. But where did I get my main story?
Why, Joan of Arc! Not plagiarism, be-
cause the. original Joan didn’t have time to
get copyright before the English burned her
and left her a total Rouen —ha, ha! It
cost my angel three thousand.”
“And what did he make out of it?”
“Another ruin—it fell down. Now, I’ll
tell you how I’m getting this angel, the
farmer from Dubbo. You remember Barron? —
he owns racehorses. I wrote a scenario to fea-
ture one of his horses winning the Mel-
bourne Cup and saving the leading lady’s
father from per-rison, and I asked Barron
to put up the money. But, of course, lie’s too
inartistic. All. that money—and his highest
idea of art is vaudeville, and his highest
excursion into music the buying of a gramo-
phone ! Now, this farmer chap, Farrier,
has a bull, and he’s as proud of that bull
as if it were his k>ved-one’s child. I altered
the scenario from the horse-race, and put
the bull in instead.”
HOW MARRIAGE DOES CHANGE US!
GOSSIP: "Jack begged Mabel to bestow her hand upon him.”
CHORUS : “Yes, and now ”
GOSSIP : “He can’t bear to be even under her thumb!”
“But a bull Can’t Win a horse-race!”
“life colild, by .running the machine quicker
in projection. But I don’t do that. Lead-
ing lady’s father threatened with gaol by
bull-fancier; leading mail enters his bull
against heavy-man’s bfill at Agricultural
Show, and his prize saves leading lady's
father.”
“But how much money do you think they
give to a bull for taking first prize? It’s
only a medal or a ribbon.”
“Is that so?. . .H’m !. . .And, of course, he
couldn’t earn enough at the stud quick
enough to save the old man.... H’m!.....
Waitabit! I’ll tell you. There is a side-
bet of a thousand pounds between my far-
mer’s bull and the heavy man’s.”
“But if the leading man had the thousand
pounds he could save the girl’s father, any-
how.”
“But, my dear chap, people don’t think in
a picture-show, they only feel. That’s what
a picture-show is for. You’ll find it works
out all right. Now, I had a scene of the
racehorse’s stable and the night attempt to
dope the horse. I’ll turn that round to the
bull’s pen ; same lighting, night scene, heavy
man tries to cut bull’s tail off—dehorn him—
anything.”
“After all, what really matters is the
money.”
“Yes —it will take about four thousand.”
“I mean the money to save the leading
lady’s father,” said Porter.
“I meant the money to make the picture.
It doesn’t sound much, but we can make a
great picture with it. There’s a lot o’ talk
about their American producers; and all the
time it’s ‘money no
object.’ Griffith and
all these other
big gun s —a r e
they ever stuck
for a thousand?
Never! Leave out
all the hot air
about a picture
costing a million
dollars, and put it
at half that, and
a man can do any-
thing with a hun-
dred thousand
pounds. Why, if
you give me money
enough I’ll pictur-
ise ‘Paradise Lost’
with the original
cast.”
He might have
offered to do the
French Revolution
with the original
cast also, but that
he was interrupted
by a short young
man with a curly
nose—not Hebraic,
but, except that it
was white, like the
curly nose of a boy
from Iviwai. The
newcomer’s clean-
cut face was that
of the bearer
of news. He
whispered something of import to Mcßorie,
and, receiving an answer apparently counsel-
ling discretion and vigilance, he left the bar,
and Mcßorie turned to Whaley again.
“That’s Falk.”
“English, isn’t he?”
“Yes —London actor. That’s why he plays
bushrangers. He’s a daredevil —before the
camera—and he says that a Dago singer—
Benvenuto or some such name —lias been at
my farmer angel trying to get him to take
out an opera company. Come and see me
triumph—or, if I don’t, come and see the
fun.”
The three men crossed the Street of Magic
and entered a long bar-room. They could
have found their man if they had been blind-
folded. Farrier, the prospective angel of the
movie-makers, a large man with a brick-red
moustache, eyes of porcelain blue, a red face,
and hands like hams. He listened and drank
—in the ratio of seventy-five to twenty-five.
But he did not listen to the swarthy little
fat man with the blue-black hair and the
comedian-blue chin—Benvenuto, the Italian
artist of opera, who waited for the bull-
merchant to try his voice. He list-
ened to the barmaid, who talked of
horses —of the noble animal often pulled,
doped and stiffened by the less noble
animals of the racecourse. Listening
did not prevent the farmer’s drinking; he
ordered drinks for all-comers; ordered ihem
in an endless chain, and showed no ill-effect
of the habit beyond a slow and perfectly-
graduated glazing of the eye.
Mcßorie introduced Porter and Whaley,
and they accepted Farrier’s invitation to
drink, seeing that here was laughter toward.
At last the barmaid exhausted herself of
horse-talk, ending with the triumphant state-
ment that Blue-and-Gold won the Wanta-
badgery Cup in 1915 or ’l6—Some time during
the war, anyhow—and removed herself to
more customers.
The Italian tried to speak,
but Mcßorie was first, as usual.
“I’ve got the scenario, Mr. Far-
rier,” he said to the man of
the glazing eyes, “and it’s got
a great part in it for your
bull.”
“Best bull in the flamin’
world,” said Farrier. “Bes’
bull ever —ever looked through
a collar,” he added, confusing
his metaphors. “Bes’ bull,” he
repeated sternly, as if somebody
had contradicted him. “Bes’
bull that ever —ever wore
shoes.”
“I know, Mr. Farrier; it’s a
great part. Make a great film.”
“F ilium?” said Farrier.
“Fillum? What’s a fillum?”
Mcßorie registered despair.
“I told you—moving pictures.
It’s a five thousand per cent,
proposition. You’ll make half
a million out of it, and it will
only cost you four thousand.”
“Cost me four thousand?
Four thousand what?”
“Four thousand pounds.”
“Poun’s? Me pay four thousand poun’s,
an’ put in my bull. too. That’s no good
to me.” His glazing eye found the
Italian, and he talked to the Italian
to save himself. “This chap wants me go
into opera company. Have a drink, An-
tonio, and tell me about —about opera com-
pany.”
“Ah ! Ker ! Ker ! Ker ! Ker ! Signore, not
Tonio —Benvenuto!” the singer pleaded, as
Mcßorie, laughing at the interruption to his
own hopes, gave place to him. “Signore,
lam great tenor of La Scala. Sing all great
tenor role; I sing most splendid.”
Farrier, his eyes changing color as they
glazed, gave his royal command for a sample,
and the bar-room tenor cleared his chanter-
pipes to sing to that audience —of three men
who tried to conceal their laughter, and a
solemnly-drunken merchant of bulls.
“It will cost but two thousand pound for
the opera company,” said the tenor. “And
we can make the profita one thousan’ five
hundred poun’ the week.”
“Sing—sing ‘Abey My Boy,’ ” said the
bull-merchant.
“Ah ! Ker ! Ker ! Ker ! Ker ! Ker ! Sig-
nore, not ‘Abey Ma Boya,’ but ‘Trovatore’
—my great part of Manrico, which I sing
before all the crown faces of Europe. It is
the first act I begin. I sing mezza voce —-
half the voice—because it is in the bar.”
His voice was of the sugary Italian sort,
cloying as treacle, and to that thick sweet-
ening lie added the Italian bleat. With his
eyes raised to the ceiling he sang, as if he
loved the sound of his own voice with a love
passing the love of women.
“M-a-a-a-a-a,” bleated the merchant of
bulls.
“ ’Scuse, Signore! Then the Count de
Luna sing.” He waved the Count de Luna
off the earth and continued : “Then I”—and
he poured out more Italian treacle.
“Y’ said that twice,” said Farrier.
“ ’Scuse, Signore, a little momentino. I
sing the con forza”
“Rot!” said the bull-merchant.
“ ’Scuse, Signore! Affeter the canzone
Azucena sing. Azucena is my mumma—
not real mumma; but on the stage. She
sing ‘Strida la Vampa.’ ”
“Wha’s ’t all ’bout? Sing ‘Abey My
P,oy.’ ”
“I tel] you what about, Signore. I
make translazione as we go. This is song
for Manrico and his mumma” —and he was
off again.
“Tha’s right—l hear that. A funny
story."
“lver ! Ker ! Iver ! No, Signore. Not funny
story. That mean ‘Now we are alone. Tell
me of that strange fat-al story !’ Not funny—-
fat-al. Then aileter that I sing scena an’
duetto. So."
He sang as if, apart from interesting the
bull-merchant in financing an opera com-
pany, he loved his own voice so much that
he could sing always.
“He’ll sing for ever and for ever,” said
Whaley aside to Frank Porter; and Mcßorie,
hearing him, said “That’s by Tosti,” and
grinned in sympathy.
“I sing this,” said the Italian —“I have
the knife, and that mean ‘Let this knife his
breast transpiercing quiver in the bad man’s
Heart.’ Next time I sing it is velocissimmi
agitate
To prove that he could sing agitatedly and
with great velocity Benvenuto burst into
loud sound that compassed the impossible
by being bleat and yell together and at once;
and then, to avoid criticism, proceeded
quickly : “In last act I am in the pris-on.”
“WhafforY”
“For being myself.”
“I see—thought it was for singin’.”
“Ah ! Signore laugh. This is serious busi-
ness. I sing in last act the great beauty of
all the opera.”
The bull-merchant returned to conscious-
ness and muttered the most truthful criti-
cism of his life on any subject! “Sounds to
me like a goat under a wet verandah swearing
at the rain. Ma-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a !
Will people give you money for that?”
“Si, Signore! One thousan’ five hundred
poun’ we profit per week- —if the people come
in the theatre.”
“One thousand five hundred a week for a
sheep. I couldn’t get that for my bull.
Sing ‘Blue Alsatian Mountain.’ Opera
company’s off.”
“If opera company is off,” said the tenor
with much dignity, “I am finish. For the
‘Blue Alsatian Mountain,’ for ‘Abey Ma
Boya’ there is the vaudeville. For myself I
am mistake —I go !”
And go he did ; so that Mcßorie, finding
himself in a clear field, attacked the farmer
as if to carry him by storm.
“Now this picture, Mr. Farrier,” said
Mcßorie, “it’s your last chance. There are
others after this scenario, but your bull is
such a beautiful bull I want you to have
first chance.”
“How much will it cost, d-’say?”
“Four thousand —maybe three.”
“Four thousan’, and I couldn’t get that
for the bull. Now, look here, have a drink.
This is what I’ll do.”
“Yes,” said Mcßorie with the suppressed
THE SUPPLY HAD RUN OUT.
ALBERT : “ Mother, I'm so lonely—I've got no
one to play with.”
MOTHER: “ Well, go and play with Dicky.”
ALBERT : “Oh, I played with him this morn-
ing, and he's not well enough to come
out yet.”
eagerness of the man who sees the game
weakening—“what’ll you do?”
“You make the picture and take all the
proffers—profits—an’ you can have my bull
for three hundred pound.”
“But I don’t want to make the picture and
I want the profits to be yours,” and then, ex-
perience having taught him how a fish looks
when it is about to sidestep a bait with a
hook in it, and in his determination to get
at least a feather of the bird that was escap-
ing him, he continued hurriedly, forcing the
scenario into the farmer’s hand. “Buy the
scenario—make the picture yourself, and take
the profits. Take the scenario, and give me
fifty pounds.”
“Rot! Fifty pound ? Why, I only got a
hundred pound for my bull! Fifty pound
for a damn lot o’ rot on paper. Conf’dence
trick! Fifty quid? Rot!”
Porter and Whaley laughed themselves over
to the Caravanserai, and Mcßorie followed
them, not too crestfallen to be able to laugh
at the treacle and bleat of the tenor, and
later at himself.
'He laughed more next day when he told
them of the exit of the farmer —“Made a
great curtain of it, he did.”
“Where’s he gone?” asked Whaley.
“He’s gone to gaol—arrested this morn-
ing for stealing the bull. Larceny as a
bailee they call it. He’d mortgaged it, and
they let him exhibit it, and then he sold it.
There’s a lot of crooks in this street, Mr.
Whaley.”
“There are.”
Mcßorie laughed at himself. “He might
have got my scenario, anyhow”
“What’ll you do with it now?”
“The stud-ram sales are coming on. I’ll
rewrite the bull part to suit a stud ram, and
get the capital from the winner before he’s
lost the edge of his success.”
And hope (that is often the only income
of the fool) came back to the Street of
Magic.

Kindred Dust.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HOW shall our dead at last return?
" hat Pow’r shall shape this flesh
for us
From ashes of the ancient urn
And bones of the sarcophagus?
Whose voice shall vex the multitude
And goad it on to further strife
Or call those, shivering and nude,
Condemned unto eternal life?
The first-begotten of the earth,
Now kindred with the dust again,
Whom from the carnal cave of birth
Came forth, appointed to be men,
Know that God sleeps; and yet they ask
What resurrection can be theirs
Who sang the song and wrought the task,
(ffilivion’s ancestors and heirs.
The - vine spins tendrils from their hair,
/The sockets of their eyes are filled
With roots of corn that ripen where
AVar through the generations tilled.
Breadwinners—they themselves are bread,
Baked, and the ferment long has ceased.
Dead are partakers of the dead
At every Bacchanalian feast.
The dust of them creeps through our doors
And daily does the housewife sweep
Dissevered atoms from her floors
That thither, uninvited, creep.
God sleeps. Even when the dust is blown
Like motes between His lattice bars
To lodge in crannies of Ilis throne
From off the faces of the stars!
With what new body can he come,
Like Jesus from a virgin womb,
Herod, from his herodium,
Or murdered Caesar from his tomb?
How shall Belshazzar forthright fare
To his deserted banquet-hall,
Doomed to renew the dreadful stare
. At the handwriting on the wall?
God sleeps. The pallid Kremlin shakes
To mourn the gashed and battered Czar.
The harem-haunting Sultan wakes
To clutch at scimitar and star;
And Circe herds her hispid swine
In groves of oak where acorns lie,
Or bloats them on the lees of wine
To bed them in her brothel-sty.
While Homer cons his Odyssey
And Popes pray in the Vatican
Kahab is at her harlotry—
Dust among dust of lustful Man.
Whose word shall thrill male atoms through
„ To happy wedlock, with the ring
For consummation on the new
A ain woman who would wed a king?
God sleeps. AA hen He awakes the sun
Shall smite us and the moon shall blight
The earth, till like a skeleton
Stripped of the dust that was her might,
Lepulsive and a ghoul of spheres,
Outworn, outlived, abhorred, out-thrust.
Toothless, she mumbles to the years—
“No more, no more comes dust to dust!”
Ail that was Man is passing hence,
00-mingling with the vast unknown,
Even like a migrant pestilence
Before a hot sirocco bloivn !
O’er tended fires where dust shall burn
God drowses aeons in a nod;
But when at last the worm shall turn
AA ho shall be found to envy God?

DARIUS.
Two Letters.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE muggy drizzle that for three days
had blotted out the dreary Flem-
ish sky and the drearier Flemish
plains had cleared. Far away beyond the
dunes of sand and the sour maritime grasses
the sea was breaking with a sullen roar upon
the beach —a cold and angry sea. A bitter
wind from the north swept inland across its
wastes and over the desolate, flat country.
Nat Ironside, struggling against it as ho
made his way towards his temporary home
in the cellar of a ruined house, was chilled
to the bone, and the very breath was frozen
upon his lips. Coughing, he dived down, as
A LAST RESORT.
THE HUM : “Give us a match, mister .”
THE VICTIM: “I don't, smoke!”
THE HUM : “Then give us a sack fer a pint.”
THE VICTIM: “I don't drink cither.”
THE HUM : “Then for Gorsake shed us a
tear.”
a rabbit pops into its warren, with a feeling
of relief. But into those damp and foetid
depths where they had slept and eaten and
joked and cursed together, Michael Keenan
would never come again.
Through the all-pervading drizzle, through
the squelching, sickening mud, Nat had
floundered with the burying-party that had
laid Michael Keenan to rest. They had
hidden the ghastly, shattered face that had
once been so fair under Belgian soil
amongst civilian dead. The great church
was almost shot away: its broken arches, its
shrine choked with rubbish testifying before
Heaven to the crimes iof Man the Destroyer.
Hut from a portion of the wall, still intact,
hung a stone Christ upon His cross, looking
with pitying eyes upon th e ruins of His
woild. At the foot of the crucifix they left
A SLIGHT MISTAKE.
MOTHER ( sternly ): “Young man, I want to know just how serious
your attentions are towards my dang liter?”
DAUGHTER'S VOICE ( agitatedly): “Mother, that's not the one!”
Michael Keenan. Then .Terry, across the
plain, so that they should not forget that he
was there behind the mist, dropped a shell
upon the grave of an innocent, long-dead
child. The burying-party, unhurt, but splat-
tered all over with mud and bits of bone,
hastily dispersed. And Nat, looking up at
the Christ, insulted and mud-defiled too, felt
His eyes fixed upon his own, in grave and
solemn wonder.
Michael Keenan was gone—Michael,
whose life seemed inextricably woven into
the pattern of his own. Nat lighted a candle
stuck into a bottle, and sat down to think
it over.
“Ye’ll be keepin’ an eye on me Micky, Nat
me dariint,” Mrs. Keenan had said that
golden day when he had said good-bye to her
in Papa-te-hui. “But there’s somethin’
in me tells me I’ll never be seein’ me Mick
again !” And she had sat her down under
the cabbage-tree in the garden, and rocking
herself to and fro refused to be comforted.
Nat loved her well: had lie not known
her all his life? Yet that day upon the
threshold of Adventure, with the sun shining
and the wind blowing upon the hills of
Maoriland, and all the blood of his young
body stirring in his veins, he had felt a
vague impatience with the woman weeping
at his feet. They were queer, these
Irish folk ! And always at the botton of his
soul, though unrealised, there was a faint
feeling of superiority to them.
But there was no one in his life like Micky
Keenan—there never could be again. They
were born within a few days of each other
in adjoining houses. Nat could not remem-
ber any time when he had not known
Michael, and his blue-eyed mother and his
broad-shouldered father, and his many shock-
headed brothers and sisters, who were much
less interesting than Micky because they
were either older or younger than he. There
were many times when the Ironsides criti-
cised their neighbors, but in the hour of
trouble who was like Mrs. Keenan? Who
but Mrs. Keenan would have come in and
done the work of their house as well as
her own, and cooked, and nursed the in-
valids when they were down with the ’flu,
and Mrs. Ironside lost little Benjamin, her
youngest? Micky and Nat went together
to the school beside the big. tall bluegum;
and in the holidays they explored the creek
and the patch of bush up the valley, and
swung in the supplejacks, and ate lawyer
and “bul-a-bul” berries; and they fished in
the deep pool beneath the willows with bent
pins tied on to long sticks with flax fibre ;
but it was nearly always Michael who fell
in. Michael, blue-eyed and black-haired, was
a dreamer. So said Mr. Connal, the school-
teacher, and though his compositions were
quite good—if always very ill-spelt—he never
could do his sums. Also, his bootlaces were
always getting untied.
The only real break in their friendship
occurred when Uncle Edward sent for Nat
to go into his big store in the city. Nat
didn’t much want to go. for he was happy
enough in Papa-te-hui; but it was a chance
of a lifetime, and lie went. Soon he became
accustomed to his new life, to the crowds, and
the excitement, and the picture-shows; and
all the days he had spent in the little township,
•ov beside the creek amongst the flax-bushes,
seemed very far away. Still, he was glad
to go back in holiday-time, and walk round
the farm with Michael, or along the one
wide street, so that- all the girls of Papa-
te-lmi should see him in his city clothes. Not
that any one of them was really worth look-
ing at, for they were as “slow as houses” after
the young ladies he knew up north!
But one Christmas —how many Christ-
mases ago?—when he came down as usual,
he found that Michael, quiet Michael, who
had never been away for more than a week
or two from the district where he was born,
had got a girl, and that girl was a peach.
Dolly was divinely tall, and Dolly was verv
fair. She had grey eyes and a roseleaf com-
plexion. and her hair was the color of maize
when it is ripe. And her nose was a shade
tip-tilted, and she could dance, and she could
sing, and she had lived in a city nearly all
her life till she and
he r wido w e d
mother had come to
take charge of the
post office in Papa-
te-liui. And from
the very first day
that she had sold
stamps ov e r the
counter to Michael
Keenan there had
been no one else in
the world for her.
and no other girl
for Michael. “Sure
it was love at first
sight," confided
Mrs. Keenan to
Nat. “And ’tis the
j nirtiest sight in
the world to see
them two together.”
It was then that
that faint sense of
superiority began to
stir for the first
time in the re-
cesses of Nat’s
mind. What could
the w onderf ul
Dolly see in
Mich ael Keenan,
tli e D reamer?
Michael his friend
certainly, but
nevertheless
Michael the Irish
clodhopper, all the
same. He felt very
sorry for Dolly, for
she might have had
Nat Ironside if she
had only waited a
little, and gone to
live in a modern
little bungalow near
the city, and had
all that her refined
tastes demanded.
For Nat was a suc-
cess in business,
and a favorite with
his uncle. Dolly was
indeed sincerely
in love with Michael, with his handsome face
and the soft tongue of him, and the gentle-
ness of his heart. But Nat belonged to the
world she knew, and he could talk of all she
had seen; and insensibly she listened, and’
walked, and talked with Nat, till the whole
township seethed with gossip that never
reached the ears of Michael Keenan.
So things were when the world was startled
with the news of war. Michael was work
ing hard upon his little farm, and thinking
of the time to come—a year hence, perhaps—
when he and Dolly would share a home to-
gether. And he was glad that his sweetheart
and his friend got ion so well; and he was
happy between the two of them.
Tim .war came, the dream was shattered.
Ihe friends enlisted the same day, though
one was in the city and one at Papa-te-hui.
And at last they sailed away together into
the blue-aud-purple distances, and side by
side watched the windswept shores of Maori-
land fade away out of sight. Thereafter
many memories of the life left behind faded
too. But in the mind of each of them abode
the same image—that of a girl with great
grey eyes waving to them from the wharf,
with the sunshine falling on her white dress,
and hair the color of ripe maize. Only
Michael enshrined her with two other
aureoled women—his mother, his toil-worn
mother, and the Blessed Virgin in her starry
robe of blue—while Nat put her picture be-
a speaking likeness of himself.
Nat and Michael saw service in Gallipoli,
ar.d were separated only to meet again in a
dreary little ruined Flemish village. And
now their companionship was ended for ever,
and they would no more walk side by side
through life, or return together in neace
and triumph to
the land of the
Southern Cross.
There came a
blast of icy
wind; a face,
magni fi e d
through smoke
an d half-light,
looked d o w n
into the cellar,
and a voice
s h o a t e d rau-
cously “Lettus!”
Iro n side
caug li t the
pocket thrown
in to him, and
the face dis-
appeared. He
u n t i e d the
string. Maori-
land letters!
The first was
from his mother, the second from Dolly. Tie
read the one from Dolly first:
Dear Nat, —Your letter has made me very unhappy,
and I don’t know what to say. It seems to me as
if I was a deceitful sort of a girl, engaged to
Michael, and letting you write to me as you, do. If
he wasn’t in the world, things would he very differ-
ent, hut how could I throw him over now, with
him at the war, and so loving and trustful as he
is ? I’m not a very good girl, I think, but it’s
Michael that keeps me straight. I’ve never felt
with any other man as I do- with him, and oh, I
wish you wouldn’t bother me again,
Nat put down the letter and 'stared at the
candle-flame; then, fumbling with his knife,
lie prized a loose brick out of the wall, drew
from a bundle of papers—all in the same
handwriting—a photograph, and held it close
to the light. It showed Dolly in evening-dress,
her comely neck, a rounded neck, rising bare
above cloudy draperies. The eyes looked at
him half-shy, half-smiling; the mouth—were
the lips a little too full?—parted under the
sweet tip-tilted nose.
"If he wasn’t in the world”—he said un-
consciously aloud. "If he wasn’t in the
world”
He kissed the photograph suddenly, pas-
sionately, then put it away again, replacing
the brick with an air of finality and decision.
All doubts and difficulties seemed cleared
away. “Michael is dead,” said a voice with-
in him. “and the world belongs to the liv-
ing.”
Yet even as the thought came to him he
felt Michael beside him—Michael whom they
had left so short a time ago at the foot of
the crucifix by the church’s broken wall,
lie was standing, as he had often stood in
life, with his head a little to one side. And
his face was as the face of the Christ, in-
sulted and defiled, and his eyes looked out
with pitying wonder over a ruined world.
Nat suddenly began to cough, and a sharp
pain stabbed his side.
The sky was deeply, darkly blue, with a
white cloud or two floating above the hills.
The long afternoon light came slanting over
green lawns and pleasant gardens. Nat got
off the crowded tram, and walked wearily
down the avenue towards his house. Since
he had been invalided home after double
pneumonia and a complication or two added
to his troubles—“must have picked up a
queer bug somewhere out in Flanders” was the
doctors’ conclusion —his flesh had never been
quite strong enough to carry out his will.
He thought this afternoon how pleasant it
would be to give up the evening jazz and sit
quiet on the verandah with Dolly’s hand in
his. But Dolly had developed a strange
restlessness, or perhaps he had suddenly
grown too old and tired for her.
Why was it that nothing ever came up to
one’s expectations V he asked himself as he
walked. He was tired, and therefore he
was depressed, but at any time was life
really worth living?
His own bungalow came into sight. To
think that he, Nat Ironside, should ever live
in such a home! How he had worked! How
lie must have got on to be able to bring
Dolly here! Yet he looked at it with dis-
favor. It needed improvements, it wanted
painting, and that lie could not for the
moment afford, and he ought to clip the
hedge. But he was always too tired, or
there was something else to do. And if all
were done, would Dolly and he be any hap-
pier together? He opened the gate, and
went up the path towards a house that
looked lifeless. Dolly had gone shopping, he
knew, and he was quite accustomed to find
her out. Yet he wondered a little that she
should be so late to-night. She would have
little time to dress for the dance to which
they were going. He opened the front door.
The hall was dark and stuffy. llow much
pleasanter it would have been, he thought,
if there had been someone there to welcome
him home! And suddenly he remembered
Mrs. Keenan—the tight hug of her arms, and
the look in her blue eyes when she comforted
a small boy who nad got into trouble. For
it had always been to Mrs. Keenan that lie
had gone, rather than to his own mother.
He went into the kitchen, and pulled up
the blind. Then it all happened just as he
had often seen it at the movies—the hungry
cat mewing round his feet, the letter stuck
upon the mantelpiece. It ran:
When you get this I shall be gone, and I am

Nat put the letter upon the table, and
mechanically sat down and took the cat upon
his knee.
Then, suddenly, as in a picture, he saw
the grey drizzle that blotted out the dreary
Flemish sky, the dreary Flemish landscape,
. Through the squelching, sickening mud the
burying-party carried their dead. They laid
their burden at the foot of the crucifix by the
broken wall —through a shower of earth and
dirty water and flying bits of bone. Nat saw
the Christ looking with pitying eyes over
the ruins of Ilis world.
Then through the ruins he saw himself
wandering with Michael and Dolly, and they
were all little tired children.

Alf’s Nerve.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
THE mail oil the opposite bench was eat-
ing a pie. Alf—Red Alf Weekes—
Watched him with murder in his heart.
Fine rich flakes of pastry fell from the pie ;
dark-brown gobs of gravy spurted lusciously
out; the swine even threw away a meatless
wedge of efust. Alf hated him ; deep in an
abyss of gnawing hunger, Alf hated him
with all his soul. Unable to bear the sight
of the orgy, he took his staring eyes from
the fast-disappearing pie, letting them fall
to his boots, or, rather, to the laces and
uppers which had once been boots. There
you were again—that, too, came of lost
nerve: that and the aching hunger, the
bench in the Domain, the dizziness and the
utter hopelessness.
Alf sighed, Time was when there had
been no Swifter, neater craftsman than him-
self in Australia. Many a time he had cut a
notecase out of a hip-pocket while the owner
paused at a crossing; many a time he had
slipped a bag off its handle and made a get-
away, With one eye on an important-looking
young man solemnly walking down the

Bracelets, pendants, watches, even Wrist-
watches and a very occasional ring—these
had been fair game, part of a good, skilful,
tOuck-and-go game whose hazard was Alf’s
life-blood. He had been famous. But not
now; 1914-18 had done all that in. The
mud and blood and horror had driven all
the confidence, the quickness of thought and
swift precision of action out of him. His
hahd shook like a drunk’s most of the time;
he couldn’t keep his mind fixed on the one
essential thing—to get it first and then think
and work like lightning for the getaway.
Fumbling, looking this way and that, Watch-
ing the .John Hop on the corner—Hell! And

stretched out the laces and uppers, and stared
morosely at theiu, Once or twice since he
came back from Orange he had pulled it
off, but clumsily and scared stiff, his heart
thumping in his throat, nearly fainting with
the effort. So he gave it best. No good,

the wistful look in his experienced eyes. Red
Alf’s Uerve was gone,
lie Watched the prosperous-looking man
peering at One seat after another. Why
couldn’t the fat fool make up his mind?
What difference did it make where he sat?
He sat dowii beside Alf; and in the end it
made a iot of difference. And he wasn’t
really very fat, except to Alf’s hungry, pre-
judiced eye. He took out a newspaper and
started reading it close to his short-sighted
eyes; beneath the paper (and hidden by it
from the short-sighted eyes) a heavy gold
chain rah unlooped from pocket to pocket.
Alf’s heart missed a beat, and his lips sud-
denly felt dry. He glanced round. The
mail of the pie had gone; a tree screened
the bench from a little knot of dossers higher
up the slope; otherwise nothing was near
enough to confuse even an amateur. Alf
remembered the pie and the sick feeling in
his empty stomach ; and his lean jaw went
hard as he set to work. Three—or, maybe,
two and a half—seconds did it; the match-
case at the other end was a bit awkward for
the 1914-18 Alf, but the watch was easy.
He was conscious that it was really a rotten
job: in the old days he would have kicked

himself for it. But it was good enough ; the
man was still reading his paper, and hadn’t
moved an inch. Now for the getaway—
“l can’t think why you don’t try the coun-
try.”
The man’s kindly eyes smiled at Alf. who
watched the Domain trees swing up to the
sky and come drunkenly back to earth while
he blinked open-mouthed at the stranger.
"Why don’t you all” —he waved his hand
over towards the dossers —“have a shot at
the country? You’re all negotiable types—
I don't say you’re good types, but you can
be productive, I’m sure. What makes you
Stay in the city to steal Watches and get
drunk and go to gaol?”
Alf’s sick feeling came rushing back at
him He licked his dry lips again and stared
white-faced and silent at the bloke.
"You’re not dumb, I suppose?” sharply.
"No,” sullenly.
"Well, why don’t you try the country?”
"I did—put down me gratuity for a place
outside Orange. I liked it —it’s a good life;
but I went in mortgaged up to the ears, an’
I ’ad three dry seasons running, with me
t.p. stock dyin’ ’round me. I couldn't make
me tucker. The mortgages come due, one
after another. And in the end I -walked
out —couldn’t do nothin’ else.”
The man’s shrewd eyes were distinctly
kindly as he listened to Alf’s muttered
apologia.
“And what now?”
“Nothin’,” su L
lenly again, the
haggard eyes on
the sole-less boots,
“And what be-
fore the war?”
A 1 f ' s unsteady
composure broke,
“Look,” he said
desperately, “why
don’t yer put me
in an’ ’ave done
with it? I ain’t
’ad a feed for two
days, an’ I’m all
in”——
“Quite so, quite
so,” the man inter-
rupted ; “by the
way, I’ll trouble
you for my watch.

sonable price, but

Alf’s s h aki n g

“At what price

“ 'Ow. chuck it,

almost screamed.
“Yer’ll ’ave me

“Listen.” The
man’s quiet voice

hysteria. "Would
you say that that
job was worth a
pound, or a couple
of pounds, or a fiver, or what?”
“It wasn’t worth fourpence,” Alf mur-
mured subconsciously. “It was a rotten job.
Why, in me old days—look, mister, I’m Red
Alf. I c’d pinch the eyebrows off a”
A sudden sob cut the sentence in two,
and Alf fell silent.
“It hurt your professional pride. Yes.
I’m not surprised. Yes. Well, that is my
estimate of its value.” He put two pound
notes on Alf’s knee.
Alf gave in. “O my God!” he whim-
pered. " “I can’t take it, mister, I can’t —I
can’t.” lie was savagely conscious of tears
running down his face, murderously con-
scious of his inability to stop them, and of a
trembling, overwhelming desire to cut and
run—run like Hell —anywhere—and hide —
hide.
Smoothly and gently the man stemmed the
tide again. Types —types of humanity—-
were his hobby. Alf struck him as a good
type; he particularly liked his professional
pride and the fact that this thief preferred
the country to the city. He did, too; but
business kept him in the city. Did Alf
know anything about poultry and pigs? Alf
nodded wretchedly while the
trembling grew less and less
in the sound of the quiet
voice. The man, Ridgway
by name —Martin Ridgway
—had a little country place
between Linden and Faul-
conbridge which might be
made profitable if the right
man ran it for him. He
liked experiments. What did
Alf think about it? The
trembling had ceased by
now.
“About what?”
“Taking on running the
place for me—l think you’ll
make it pay for both of us.
How about it?”
Alf stared at him. “My
God !” he whispered ; “d’ye
mean it?"
The trembling started
again as the restful, confi-
dent voice assured him that
he did mean it, and went
into details of how it was
to be effected. Alf listened.
At the end he stood up, his
shoulders a little squarer
and his eyes steadier; only
about his lips did a shadow
of the trembling hover.
“Look,” he said, “I’ll go
an’ get a feed. And” —he
paused a moment before he
went an—“l’ll never lift a
pocket-book nor snatch a
thing again, so ’elp me God.”
The opportunities for lifting and snatch-
ing at St. Michael’s were few and far be-
tween, though an all-round haul could have
been profitably made of some of the contents
of the comfortable house. Alf enjoyed him-
self. The pigs and poultry kept him busv
all the morning and a huge neglected garden
all the rest of the day. There were out-
houses and sheds to be made weathertight
and put into shape generally; broken and
fallen fences; a bit of clearing on the west-
ern side of the house- —plenty of work. Old
Mrs. Riordan. the caretaker, who cooked his
meals, had a wary eye on him as an inter-
loper at first; but she became reconciled
gradually to the idea of a man working about
the place—even liked him finally. Mr.
Ridgway came up once or twice for week-
ends and pottered about contentedly, obvi-
ously rather proud of the way St. Michael’s
was coming into shape as a productive pro-
perty instead of a fallow holiday-place. He
clearly hated to go back to Sydney when
Monday—or more often Tuesday—morning
came.
Through it all Alf’s nerve was gradually
stiffening. By slow degrees the garden made
him sleep, and the steady, quiet work pul
a firm sanity into his mind. lie became part
and parcel of St. Michael’s, the creator and
the servant of its production. Sometimes
his memory slipped back to the hazard of
the touch-and-go tussle of the old years, but
not for long, and seldomer and seldomer a.-
THE INDISPENSABLE HYMN.

“Never see no such thing before. They buried the poor fellow like

the months went by. He was content. He
had found his place on earth; and happily
he shut all memories out of it.
Mr. Ridgway’s information that lie was
bringing Mrs. Ridgway up for the following
week-end was the first disquieting note in
the six months of peace. Alf, looking out a
clean collar on the Friday afternoon, hoped
fervently that she was a comfortable, middle-
aged body like her husband.
She wasn’t. She was a peroxide blonde
of about half his age, and she was bored to
death by him. Alf mistrusted and disliked
her. She went round the place with them
soon after their arrival, her theatrical de-
light in the young chickens and the garden
as absurd and overdone as her six-inch heels
and twelve-inch skirt. Alf’s sensitive, pick-
pocket’s mind felt the glances from her
slanting eyes—an alley-cat, if ever lie saw
one. Ridgway seemed fond of her in a de-
tached. fatherly manner —anxious that every- j
tiling possible should be done for her com-
fort and that sort of thing. But Alf’s brood- i
ing mistrust sat back and watched until she j
should be gone. She was a menace. Sooner j
or later she’d slip up her middle-aged hus j
band and take her wares elsewhere.
This premonition was confirmed.. One j
Tuesday midday she came tearing out iu the j
township motor, and tap-tapped down the i
yard to Alf.
"I stayed here last week-end,” she said j
softly, the slant eyes watching Alf with a '
lialf-smile.
Alf didn’t get it for a moment.
“Oh,” he said morosely when he did.
“Yes. It’s better for Mr. Ridgway’s
peace of mind that he should know I was
up here for the week-end. Don’t you think
so?”
Alf glanced at the alley-cat lift of her
lips and turned back to his work. Her
argument was sound; Ridgway’s peace of
mind was good evidence with Alf.
“All right,” he said curtly. “You’d better
put Mrs. Riordan on,” he added without
looking up from the saddle he was patching.
The slant eyes went hard and venomous,
but she said nothing; and presently the tap-
tapping began again and faded away.
The following week-end Ridgway came up
alone, with apparently no interest in Mrs.
Ridgway’s late movements. Anyway, he
made no reference to her three-days’ stay of
a week ago, either to Alf or to Mrs. Riordan.
Alf was relieved ; he didn’t mind an ordinary
bluff. On the contrary. But Ridgway was
the bloke of the two quid and the oath in
the Domain. He gave Ridgway the half-
dozen letters that had come during the week
a ud
"Oh,” he said suddenly, “Jess is pretty
sick, Mr. Ridgway. I wish you’d have a look
at her while you’re here.”
Ridgway stuffed the letters into lus breast
pocket.
“Righto, Weekes,” he said. “We’ll go
and have a look at her now. This mail can
wait.”
The mare was lying on the stable floor,
very drowsy and draggled-looking. Ridgway
knelt down-at her head and opened her
mouth. After a moment he glanced up at
Alf.
“Slip up to the kitchen and- bring some
hot water, will you?” he said.
In the hall Alf found Mrs.:Ridgway, her
eyes haggard and-full of fear. •
“Oh, Mr. Weekes,” she whispered, “has
Mr. Ridgway seen the mail?”
“No,” he answered; “at least ’e ’asn’t read
it yet. I give it ’im an’ ’e put it in ’is
pocket an’ came out to doctor Jess lvith me.
Why ?”
Alf’s cold eyes watched her hands clasping
and unclasping.
“There’s a letter,” she began, and gulped
and stopped.
“Will you do something for me?” she went
on. her voice full of pleading.
"If I can.”
"It isn't exactly for me—l know that’s no
good. It’s for him —for Martin. There’s
a letter in the mail, a letter with the Bathurst
postmark”
She put the restless hands on Alf’s arm.
“Oh, get it from him—get it somehow,
anyhow. If he is to have another moment’s
happiness in the world get it —get it before
he reads it. Will you do that, to save his
happiness, perhaps his reason?”
Alf looked at her, all his mistrust and con-
tempt on guard.
"It isn’t what you think it is,” she said
hurriedly. “Listen. If you don’t get that let-
ter you will regret it all your life ; you’ll lose
your friend: and he’ll lose everything lie
wants to keep on earth. Oh, can’t you see?
I’m not”
“Weekes!” A faint call came from the
stable. Alf took her hands oil his arm
in silence, and in silence got his hot water
and went across the yard. His sunburned
face was full of anxious thought at first, but
by the time he reached the stable-door it was
hard and purposeful. Ridgway was still
kneeling at Jess’s head, and Alf gave him
the jug and knelt beside him.
If you had been a super-sensitive person
with very quick eyes, and had been watching
the two men working over the sick horse, you
might have seen two incredibly rapid flashes
of Alf’s hands. Even if you had been quick
enough to see them there would be a half
uncertainty in your mind that the flashes had
happened. Between them Alf read the post-
marks on the letters and kept the Bathurst
one; and all the time he seemed to be hold-
ing Jess’s mouth open and helping Ridgway to
dose her, talking, advisedly, quieting the
horse.
Before he left Ridgway told Alf that he was
going to Queensland and would not be up at
St. Michael’s for a month. Alf received the
information in a conscience-blurred silence
and watched the departing motor from the
abyss of the old hopelessness. No good-
no good now; lie must clean up and get out.
The haven was gone. He had broken the
only oath he had ever meant, made to the
only man who had been clean with him from
first to last. No good—no good: it was
the ’Loo again and the rough-and-tumble.
Well, he’d got his nerve back; and he’d got
a month —he needn’t skin out and leave the
place all ends up.
For three weeks the wretched half of him
that was left worked like a Trojan. ’When
he was ready to leave St. Michael s looked
like a model farm, spick and span and per-
fect. „„
But the “getaway” didn’t come off. I firec
days before it was due the station motor
stopped at the gate, piled up with luggage,
and in it Mr. Ridgway alone. Alf stared
at him. , _ , ~
“Yes, I’m a bit early, I know. Lome iu
here.” . . .
Alf followed him into the sitting-room and
sat down.
"I’ve sold my business and I'm here for
good—going to breed fat pigs with you to the
finish.”
Alf roused himself.
A DELUSION
“He swanks a lot lately."
“Yes, they’re fattening him for Christmas,
and the poor fool thinks they're getting
him ready for the Easter Show.”
"No, Mr. Ridgway,” lie said; "it’s no good
—l’ve got to go.”
Ridgway’s face fell. Then he, too, seemed
to rouse himself.
“What stock have you got on the place,
Weekes?” he demanded briskly.
Alf’s face lit up and he gave him a rapid
summary of fat pigs and young pigs, broody
liens, laying hens, broilers, chicks.
“Seems a pity to leave all those live things
for the sake of a letter,” Ridgway commented
thoughtfully.
Alf’s jaw fell.
“Lumme,” lie rapped out, “did I queer it
again? Was it another rotten job? Look.
Mr. Ridgway,” he pleaded, “did yer feel any-
thing? God, I’ll never get me nerve back —
it’s gone for good.”
Alf’s face was black with despair, but
Ridgway laughed.
“No, it was a perfect job. I felt nothing—
knew nothing till I got back from Jess. But
I knew the writing, Weekes; it wasn’t the
first letter I’d had from Bathurst. And I
missed it when I went through the mail
again. The rest of it I guessed.”
The laughter died out of his face and he
sighed.
“This experimenting with types is all
right, but sometimes you bite oft more than
you can chew. We’ll be alone here; there
won’t be any Mrs. Ridgway in a few months
when the case is heard.”
He sighed again; and sat upright.
“What’s this complaint of Gaskells’ about
small eggs?” he asked.

Pride.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
NOW that your heart is part of the sand
Of your shallow grave in that arid
land,
And because the dust in your mouth and ears
.burns dry and hot like brittle sneers,
I will go again to the house on the hill
’Mid the trees and the rioting daffodil.
Before another summer stirs
Sap of the poplars and the firs,
Before the violet flames are dead
In bordered ways, while overhead
Your sky is patterned still for rain,
I'll tramp the gusty drive again.
I ll smell the wind-flung lupin scent
And see the river where the bent
Verbena lets the valley through
With its drifting spires of misty blue,
And in my face the sleety rain
Will beat a solace sharp as pain.
Like a tattered flag my vaunted pride
ban trail, and your tongue will not deride.
It is dust, and your eyes are dust, and your
taunting stare—
The unspoken sneer that stabbed the shud-
dering air.
My heart can break in sobs, and as I creep
Down the long drive, I can weep, I can
weep!

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
EVERY Wednesday afternoon for the
last three years and more Freda had
caught the train that left a few
minutes before 2 —she was never quite sure
of the exact time, for she had no head
for figures. There was always the same
bustle to the station, the. terrified glance at
the row of clocks, and the rush down the
ramp, clutching her parcels. The afternoon
trains were generally empty, and that was
a comfort. She could settle herself at ease
in a corner of the carriage and feel her par-
cels carefully to make sure that everything
was there —the chocolate, the woollen singlet
she had knitted, and the box of pastry that
Mrs. Bryce always eyed suspiciously, having
her own ideas about what was good for a
child.
A whistle, a slamming of doors by violent
young porters, and the train was off. What
a relief to get away from the thick smell
of cooking in the restaurant! Even the
suburban back yards seemed clean and spa-
cious, with their strips of bleached grass and
their washing hung on the line. High above
were white clouds edged with silver, and
the jagged roofs and smoky chimneys cut
into a sky of deepest blue. Then there was
the dark, winding channel of the river, and
the draught-horses feeding on its banks, look-
ing shaggy and wild in spite of their harness-
marks and collar-galls. It was like running
into a world of mutes, for all noises were
muffled, and even the clatter of plates and
cutlery faded in Freda’s memory.
“If I could only have a little place in the
country here,” she thought, as they left the
last suburb behind, “I’d be quite, quite
happy.”
And she immediately called up a picture
of a Wick cottage with a garden full of
hollyhocks, and a boy coming up the path
swinging a schoolbag. A boy of 15 or so!
She would be more than 40 when Ernest
was as old as that, but she would not mind
being middle-aged if she could keep Ernest
with her.
It was half-a-mile from the station to the
house where the old couple lived—over a
ricketty bridge, and across a paddock where
three or four cows were feeding. She was
flushed and panting when she reached the
back gate leading to the Bryces’ kitchen.
Mummy!” called a shrill voice from the
tall grass in the corner. “Come here and
look! Snip has kittens. Free of them!”
And then a little challengingly as she came
nearer: “What have you got for me in
those bags?”
Always the same question! The blue,
dull little eyes hardly ever looked higher
than the brown parcels in her hand, and
when she tried to coax the child into, some
display of affection he grew sulky, squirm-
ing away from her. “Why do you do that?”
the blue eyes seemed to say. “I’m not yours.
I’m Granny’s.”
It was different when she got him to her-
self out there in the paddock, and they had
afternoon-tea on the grass. But first there
was the interview with “Granny” to be gone
through in the kitchen, the talk about colds
and measles, and the difficulty of making
Ernest eat enough meat. ' The stout,
motherly old woman had a prejudice against
confectionery of all kinds, and believed
Ernest would be healthier if those brown-
paper parcels did not arrive so regularly
each week. She sat in her large wooden
chair, looking at Freda’s white boa and
patent-leather shoes with shrewd, apprais-
ing eyes.
“Still, you’re his mother,” she admitted.
“It’s for you to say what’s good for him.”
“Oh, no, Mrs. Bryce,” Freda was quick
to reply. “You know what’s best. I just
can’t help bringing him things, though.”
Outside in the paddock she lay on the
grass and watched Ernest as he ran about
chasing yellow butterflies with a switch. His
little tight boots stumbled on the slippery
tussocks, and he rolled over like a ball
straightening his hat with a frown as he
got up and resumed the chase. It
was the frown that reminded her of the
other Ernest. How like his father he was
with his close-set eyes, fair cropped-hair’
and queer laugh that seemed to affect only
one corner of his mouth! There was his
way of dominating her, too. It was he w'ho
decided whether they would stay in the pad-
dock or go down by the waterhole, and he
had a perverse way of insisting on the very
things she didn’t want to do.
“We will, mummy. I want to. You
must.”
It was sheer bullying, but she always
yielded, though she knew he never tried
those tactics with “Granny.” There was
something in him to which Mrs. Bryce could
appeal and she could not. Besides, he had
a child’s genius for discovering weaknesses
and playing on them.
She always came home from these visits
with a dull ache inside her, sitting in a cor-
ner of the empty carriage and staring at
the flat paddocks and the suburban back
yards that looked so frowsy in the dusk.
Another week to be gone through! The
warm smell of the restaurant came forward
to meet her, flowing round her, drugging her
senses, and finally swallowing her up. The
noise of engines, trams, motor-cars sounded
like the rattle of cutlery. Before her floated
the face of Vesey, the proprietor, smooth as
wax, and quite lifeless except for the eyes
which were little pinpoints of steel.
Once she had taken some pleasure in being
sentimental about herself, and had written
bitter letters to Ernest accusing him of hav-
ing ruined her life, and so on. That was
generally after she had been moved by some
Picture at the cinema about a woman like
herself. It was a relief to abandon her self-
control and let herself be carried along by
ilvaves of emotion, extracting the last drop
of pathos from the situation.
But she did not often sink into those moods
now. She was too fond of her boy to regret
his coming, and her only feeling for the
other Ernest ivas a dull sort of sympathy.
After all, it was not entirely his fault that
she had been left like this. Often she
dropped things into the post for him, con-
fectionery, a knitted scarf, a box of the cork-
tipped cigarettes he used to smoke; and in
return would come things carved delicately
out of wood, like the glove-box with grapes

on the lid that she kept on her dressing-table.
P>nt there was nothing very personal about
these gifts. They had become a kind of
courtesy that had formed like thin ice over
their cooling passion.
All her capacity for emotion was concen-
trated upon little Ernest, and he had never
shown any curiosity about his father. Once,
though, in the excitement that had followed
the Armistice, she had brought him into
town to see a military display, and watch-
ing the long lines of marching- troops he had
become still and absorbed. Suddenly he
turned and looked up with his queer little
frown.
“My daddy’s a soldier,” he announced.
She did not reply, and he tugged angrily
at her skirt.
“Mummy, why don’t you talk? My
daddy’s a soldier.”
“Yes, dear; that’s right,” she assented.
After that the idea became so fixed that
he would have, nothing but military toys.
Instead of chasing butterflies with a switch
he wanted to march about the paddock all
the afternoon, shouting orders to himself or
driving the ducks up from the waterhole
in proper formation. Sometimes when going
back to “Granny” he would persist in asking
Freda when his daddy was coming home,
and she always answered that it would be
very soon now. She was convinced in hex-
own mind that it would be very soon.
But it was with the idea of getting him
more completely to herself that she took
him to live with her in a couple of rooms
in town, having at last found a landlady
who would look after him when she was
at work. The parting with “Granny” was
difficult, and was not accomplished without
various deceits, but the memory of the old
farmhouse, the paddock and the waterhole
lasted hardly more than a fortnight in the
boy’s mind. He was happy in the back yard
with his toy-soldiers and his air-gun, and
the restaurant was no longer a prison to
I reda. She hurried home from the crowded
tram each evening with feet that seemed
to brush the pavement as lightly as a swal-
low’s wings, and the only worry in her mind
was what she would do when the other
Ernest came. For he had written saying
he was coming, and in the stiffly-affectionate
phrases she read that he was bent on doing
ins duty. Perhaps he felt that it was neces-
sary to make some return for the sweets, the
woollen comforters and the cigarettes that
had lightened the four years of his intern-
ment. And she was ready to accept any-
thing he decided on for the boy’s sake.
He came at last, a fair-haired, rather sar-
donic man, with blue, lack-lustre eyes, like
little- Ernest’s. In the landlady’s stuffy
sitting-room Freda sat talking to him, won-
dering why his kiss remained cold on her
cheek, and why they found so little so say
to one another.. He was kind enough, but
strange and stiff, like a figure moved by
clockwork. The spell of sitting behind
barbed-wire and waiting seemed to have
stupefied him, and when he talked about
marrying and making a home his words
sounded unreal. Then the little boy was
brought in, and his father picked him
up and laughed.
“Hello, little chap ! Is it you don’t know
your daddy?”
Little Ernest stared at him for awhile with
curious, sullen eyes, and then struggled and
kicked, a violent hysteria contorting his face.
“Let me go !” he burst out, pounding with
his fists. “Let me go! You’re not my
daddy. My daddy’s a soldier.”
The father laughed.
“You don’t want me for a daddy, eh?
Never mind. We’ll get to know one another
better some day.”
He was quite urbane, but he was not
quick to let the struggling boy go. A master-
ful light kindled his dull, blue eyes, and
his forehead showed a pinkish tinge near
the roots of his fair hair. Freda took the
sobbing child away to his soldiers in the
back yard and then returned. Was she sorry
he had received his father like that? She
did not quite know, as she sat in the dusky
sitting-room looking at the blonde stranger
and wondering why she had once thrilled
at his touch. The dreams she had spun
in those days seemed far, far away. AH
that remained of them was this stiff, un-
romantic figure, with his scent, his foreign
accent and his air of bleak politeness.
She did not talk about daddy to Ernest as
she tucked him in his cot that night. She
did not want to talk of anything; all she
wanted was a little quiet in which to make
her decision. For the second time she was
conscious of a sharp jealousy. It was un-
just that she should have to share the scanty
store of little Ernest’s love with anyone else.
He was hers, and no one else’s.
The boy was flushed and a little un-
strung, as if he had gone through an emo-
tional storm, and he had to be sung to
sleep. Once during the night he woke up
crying, and she had to get out of bed to
comfort him, turning up the light to drive
away any nightmare that might be haunting
him.
“He’s not my daddy!” the child sobbed
with his eyes tightly shut.
“It’s all right, darling,” she crooned. “Go
to sleep again.”
“He’s not my daddy!” the child sobbed,
“I haven’t got a daddy.”
When she did not reply he wriggled in
her arms and kicked with his feet.
“I haven’t got a daddy,” lie repeated
shrilly.
She felt that he had decided for her, as
he always did, and a feeling of drugged con-
tentment soaked through her.
“No, darling,” she said soothingly, “it’s
all right. You haven’t got a daddy.”

The Track Through the
Gorge.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
KITTY LARACY, her chin cupped in
her hands, her elbows resting on the
bar of the “Drovers’ Arms,” looked
out with little interest through the open
doorway of her uncle’s hotel on the dust and
lifeless heat and glare. Yesterday she
had looked out on the same scene; to-morrow
she would do likewise. Once the monotony
of things had made her restive; once, many
yesterdays ago, she had rebelled. Now she
did not care. For her life had become a
backwater, still, sluggish, currentless, where
nothing happened, nothing mattered. Yet
she was young and pretty—too young and
pretty to be so minded.
Two Chinamen came into the bar, looked
from end to end of it, as though in quest
of someone other than herself, bade her good-
day, and called for whisky. She knew T them.
Once a month for several months past they
had visited the bar. But always they had
sought out her uncle Paul, now groaning
with sciatica in his bedroom. Always she
had seen and heard them, heads bent close
to his, talking in whispers. Now because
she remembered this she knew that one of
these two men would question her, and
when the question came she had her an-
swer ready.
“No, you can’t see him. He’ll allow no
one to see him. He’s bad with sciatica. But
if you’ll tell me what you want I’ll let him
know.”
Slowly they shook their heads, softly they
thanked her, blandly they smiled. But that
was all. Washing their whiskies down with
water, they turned away. As they left the
bar Constable Tom Walsh stepped into it, for
the first time in his life.
“Good day, Miss Laracy,” he said, lifting
his cap as though glad to be rid of it for a
while. “Warm, isn’t it?”
Kitty (lid not like hig, good-looking Con-
stable Walsh. Her uncle had warned her
against him. “Never trust a policeman,
Kitty,” lie had said to her; “and, above all,
have nothing to do with that swine Walsh.
He’s one of the worst.”
Also Wilkins —although she had no time
for Wilkins either—had told her something
about Walsh that had bitten into her
woman’s pride as acid bites into fine silk.
was talkin’ down at the store the other
day,” said Wilkins, “and he reckoned the
girls in this town was just cheap stuff—in-
cludin’ you. It made me so mad that I spat
out in front of him, and gave him a look that
showed what sort of a cow I thought him.”
These things in her mind, Kitty countered
his genial greeting with a cool nod.
Nowise disconcerted, Walsh placed his cap
on the bar, unbuttoned the collar of his
tunic, wiped his forehead and called for a
drink. She set his order before him, giving
him scarcely a glance as she did so, and
then, leaning indifferently against the bar,
looked past him through the open doorway.
Somehow it seemed to her that if he were
not a policeman, and not the cad of Wil-
kins’s story, life might become worth caring
for. after all.
Though pretending indifference to his pres-
ence she suddenly blushed, and swiftly
looked up when he spoke again.
“It’s a dull life you lead here, Miss
Laracy,” he said.
She laughed lightly. “You don’t come
here too often to brighten it, Mr. Walsh.”
She meant it for satire, but if he under-
stood it as such he gave no indication. He
said quietly, disarmingly; “Well, I will in
future, Miss Laracy.”
After that the tension seemed to ease a
little, and he went on to talk about the
crops and the conditions of the stock, and
the way things were with the mines at
Goolong, 40 miles out in the ranges.
Gradually her hostility eased off, and she
found herself speaking as she would to any
other customer. What did it matter if he
was a policeman? she asked herself. Per-
haps Wilkins had lied about him; Wilkins
often lied. Long after he had gone the pic-
ture of him was in her mind—big, strong,
smiling, athletic. She went over their con-
versation. For once it seemed he had put
aside his policeman’s uniform. But stay!
Had he? Why had he wanted to know about
her uncle’s cattle on the ranges? Why had
he mentioned the hut on the Dead Cow
Track? And why had he come into the bar
just as the Chinamen moved out of it? Could
it be that he had been making use of her,
after all? Her eyes hardened, her hands
clenched.
At that moment AVilkins, thick-set, thick-
lipped, his brows black with a scowl that
lifted at the sight of her, appeared. Slouch-
ing up .to her he said: “You look great to-
day, Kitty. Pleased over the John’s visit,
eh ?”
She regarded him with level eyes.
“P’raps,” she answered —“p’raps just as
much as I am at yours.”
lie laughed. “Don’t be prickly. Pretty
girls shouldn’t be nasty—shouldn’t show how
sharp their teetli are, no matter how nice
and white they may he. Give me a drink.”
He slapped down a coin, poured spirits
from the bottle she placed before him, and
then, leaning over and leering at her, lie
growled :
“That John didn’t come here to admire
you. He came here to pump you, and. by
Hell. I’ll bet he got all he came after. But
I'll bluff him—don’t fear, I’ll bluff him !”
“Why should he want to pump me? AVhat
is there that he wants to find out?”
Wilkins closed one eye meaningly. “Never
you mind, sweetheart. I know, and your
uncle knows, but your uncle’s secret’s safe
with me.”
“So there is a secret?”
“There is, and AVaksh is on the track of
it. Give me another glass. I’m ridin’ far
and fast to the Dead Cow Track in an hour
or so. Tell the boss that; maybe he won't
like it. But I’ve to get there before that
damned cop. And tell the old man, too, that
findin’s kecpin’s.”


Flushed of face, he made a sudden grab at
her hand, but. she drew it back as though a
snake had struck.
“Never mind, my Kitty, never mind,” be
growled, his blunt jowl thrust foiward. “I’ll
get you yet.”
When he had gone she sought her unci”.
“Uncle,” she said, "something queer’s going
on.”
Lying on his bed, his face twisted with
pain, he listened while she told of Y\ alsh s
visit, and of what Wilkins had said. Twice
or thrice he interrupted her with a groan,
and when she had finished it was not only
the pain that wracked his nerves.
“Kitty,” he said, “you’ve got to go for a
ride this afternoon. You’ve got to get to the
musterers’ hut on the Dead Coav Track be-
fore either Walsh or Wilkins. God! If you
don’t get there before the policeman I’m a
done man. Under the floor there, under a
board in the right-hand corner next the fire-
place, you’ll find a package. Bring it back
to me, and let no one know that you have
it. The chestnut’s in the stable. Eor God’s
sake, hurry, girl. Take the track this side
of the Hump. It’s rough, but it’s the short-
est. Come back the same way.
The sun’s rays were at a definite slant
when Kitty, who had not spared the chest-
nut, began her descent into the sombre gorge
through which the Dead Cow Track wound.
A mighty shadow, thrown by the mountain
above, crept across the gorge, across the
creek at the bottom, and slowly, silently
stole up the timbered talus on the farther
side. Before she had reached the bottom,
where the going was comparatively easy, the
shadow had climbed half-way up the opposite
wall of cliffs, and dusk had settled on the
green depths.
The track Avound through river oaks,
Avliose brown needles carpeted it. By
its side ran a river, a brawling, voieefu!
thing, that hurried on in the green gloom,
rolling lapstones over and over as it sped
along. No wind blew, the oaks were silent;
no bird called. The place seemed without
life, Avithout song; nevertheless, a very beau-
tiful thing Avas happening all around her.
The gorge seemed Availed in on every side by
tall, grey sandstone cliffs. Left and right,
in front and behind, they appeared to close
her in. Over these cliffs, wherever a creek
emptied itself from the uplands, a hundred
waterfalls dropped down. Some catching
the sun’s rays were arched by rainbows,
some Avere pure silver. They fell like veils
of gossamer.
Kitty, however. Avas in no mind to admire
the beauty of the scene. Her one purpose
was to reach the hut before Walsh got there.
Walsh had fooled her. Her desire Avas not
so much to save her uncle from harm as to
defeat the policeman. Before she reached
the hut darkness, thick and windless, had
fallen, and when she came upon it, a thing of
slabs and bark, it was suddenly and with
something of a shock.
She reined in her horse and listened. There
Avas no sound save the far-off hoAvl of a
dingo. No hoof-beat near or far.
Dismounting, she tied her horse up, and
then, striking a light, entered the hut. Off
the Avail by the door hung a hurricane lamp.
This she lit, and carrying it with her hur-
ried to the corner by the fireplace, and lifted
the loose board. From underneath she took
a paper-covered package. Replacing the

board she stepped towards the door. It was
good to feel that she had defeated Walsh —
fooled him, with all his cunning. Half-way
to the door she paused, arrested by some-
thing—held by a strange, sickly, sweet smell.
She lifted the package to her nostrils.
She recalled a scene witnessed a year or
more ago. It Avas a fine, starry night
Avith a cool wind blowing up from the
river. With her uncle she had gone
for a Avalk through the Chinese quarter.
As they passed by a shabby den a
door had opened, and Walsh, eyes blazing,
had emerged. By the arm he held a young
girl—a girl dull-eyed, sick-looking; a girl
whose head drooped as though she had no
power in her spine to support it. As he
passed, half-dragging, half-carrying the girl,
his eyes had looked furious, and there Avas
that in his set face that made Kitty
quail. Yes, she had cause to remember that,
strange smell.
She stood stock-still in the middle of the
hut, holding the package at full length from
her. Sensing what it was, she hated it.
Shocked, stunned, still as a statue, she stood
for awmle. Then thought, then action came
back to her. For this she had defeated Con-
stable Walsh!
The fireplace was full of bark and wood.
She put a match to the pile, and when it
flamed and reddened she placed the unopened
package upon it. Then, because the place
seemed desecrated by the smell which now

Sam Johnson.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
THE illustrious Dr. Johnson was very
tall and burly; grotesque in sudden
purposeless movements, as though
some witch were compelling him to jerk
his limbs about. Scars, said to be of scrofula,
disfigured his neck. Scrofula nowadays is
an obsolete term for tubercular glands,
which, if they break and form scars, are
often of the greatest gravity, and may lead
to worse than disfigurement. But no one
can say what may have lived in the scalps
of that unclean age—he Avas born in 1709 —
when feiv houses had baths, and most men
were probably only fully washed twice in
their lives —on the day of their birth and
that of their death.
Any such irritation of
the scalp might easily
cause swelling of the
glands of the neck,
which would in time
form abscesses and
burst with no more
shocking result than
to produce scarring.
We are apt to forget
how terribly un-
healthy every person
must have been in
those days, before the
discovery of adenoids
or the recognition of
the disastrous effects
of diseased tonsils, or
the urgent need for
repair of the teeth.
The real marvel is
that anybody ever
grew to greatness.
When he was a
young man those ex-
traordinary habits be-
gan that so impressed
hi s contemporaries.
He grew to be afraid
of himself; he must
have company. He
feared that he Avas
growing mad; he was
afflicted by constant
twitchings and move-
ments of body and
limbs; he was com-
pelled to roll his body
in a silly fashion that
moved the onlooker to
laughter; after finish-
ing one of his dia-
tribes that passed for
conversation he
would exh a 1 e the
air from his lungs in
a mighty pant, like a porpoise springing into
the air. Before he entered a door he had
to regulate his steps that one particular foot
would be first over the lintel. He could
not pass by a horse-post upon the footpath
without placing his hand upon it, and if he
inadvertently did not do so he must retrace
tfi s footsteps till he could repair the omis-
s}on. H e drank vast quantities of tea. He
did these gilly things, not because he pre-
ferred to act like a zany, but because he
cou } d no t help it. The explanation must be
that somehow his “unconscious” had received
ghock and h suffered f rom what we call
Dsvc h a sthenia.
This comparatively new branch of psyeho-
logical medicine was probably discovered
People found that the old term "neuras-
thema” would not decently cover many per-
fcctly well-assured classes of neivous trouble,
1“ neurasthenia, as I read it, the man’s ner-
vous system has become weary of the inces-
sunt struggle to live—because the mere act
of living, even under the most sheltered con-
ditions, demands a good deal of nervous
strain. But in psychasthenia it has never-
had a fair chance. Either something has hap-
pened, before he or his parents were born,
to render him abnormal; or, if his heredity
has been perfectly sound, then his education
has been faulty. We must not count the
education only to begin at the time when he
crawled unwillingly to school. It began with
the first gentle wash that his mother’s monthly
nurse gave him ; it proceeded with every sight
QUITE USED TO IT.
LAWYER: “The cross-examination docs not seem to worry you. Hare you had any previ-
ous experience?"
WITNESS: "Ten children."
and sound that has fallen upon his sense-
organs from the time that the nurse wrapped
him in his little diaper. Long before a child
can understand the meaning of the things
In- sees and hears they affect him ; and the
result of unpleasant surroundings may be
lifelong misery. Too much care cannot be
taken to ward the apparently unconscious
infant from horrid things: if father and
mother must quarrel let them quarrel out of
its sight and hearing.
Perhaps it was not only because of his
poverty that Sam Johnson had to leave Ox-
ford without taking a degree. It could not
have been a pleasing sight for the decent and
normal students of that respectable Univer-
sity to see such a frightful bounder in their
midst —a creature who was all scarred, who
jerked continually as though he had St. \ itus’s
dance, and who was shy and inexpressibly
gaunt and ungainly. Life could not have
been very pleasant for him at that Univer-
sity ; and it would be quite like the male
young to make it still more unpleasant by
that covert satire and sneering which they
can do so well, yet never give the victim a
chance of remonstrance. And it would be
quite like Johnson, a proud man, to say that
he had had to leave the ’Varsity because of
his miserable poverty. Better poor than
gawky. The actual cause of his nervous
defect it is impossible to say; apart from
(lie unusual mental condition of his father,
which could see in life nothing but gloom,
some woman may have locked him up in a
dark cupboard when he was. as she thought,
too young to be seriously frightened ; some-
one may have pretended to torture him for
a joke; someone may have told him ghost-
stories —there are hundreds of explanations
that will occur to anybody who knows the
way that little babies are continually
treated.
Psychasthenics are often men of really
great ability. I have no doubt whatever that
Beethoven was a psychasthenic. Similarly.
Charles Lamb must have been one; and pro-
bably Kant, who used to live largely in his
slippers. The novelists found out all about
psychasthenia long before the psychologists,
for Mr. Dick, with his imperative idea about
King Charles’s head, was undoubtedly a
psychasthenic. Don Quixote? Doubtful;
for his abnormality led him to actual delu-
sions. The incidents of the sheep and the
windmills could hardly be explained by mere
psychasthenia. Some psychologist should
take the trouble to review Don Quixote
thoroughly.
We must understand exactly what a
few definitions imply. There is the Impera-
tive Idea, which continually keeps mounting
into consciousness, but does not lead neces-
sarily to foolish action. Then there is the
Obsession, which is simply an imperative
idea that causes a man to. do something,
often silly. Really, journalists should un-
derstand what an obsession is. because they
are always using the word without any idea
of what it means. Even Sir Arthur Quiller
Couch protests against it. It is really a
technical term, and should only be u’sed
strictly in its proper meaning. Quiller Couch
is quite right in saying that it should not be
used in the sense that he uses “possess,” but
he is mistaken in saying that it should not
be used at all; for there is no other word
that implies both imperative idea and result-
ant actions. Thus it was an imperative idea
of Dr. Johnson’s that he must put his hand
upon every horse-post that he passed; to
follow the idea into necessary action turned
it into an obsession.
Your psychasthenic is generally troubled
with doubts, and is continually afflicted with
a conscience, which reproves him for fancied
sins. Thus, just before Johnson died his
memory recalled certain incidents of the
long ago, when he had been sinfully familiar
with young girls of the town; this made him
intensely unhappy, and was a clear result
of his psychasthenia, for the ordinary young
man would have forgotten such things.
Those men who, taking up the Church,
find themselves afflicted with frightful
doubts, are often psychasthenics. Psychas-
thenia and Neurasthenia, those grim but pret-
tily-named sisters, walk hand in hand, their
fingers so closely intertwined that it is diffi-
cult to say where one ends and the other
begins; and a footstep behind walks Melan-
cholia, the grimmest of them all, for she is
undoubtedly mad. To that extent, and only
to that extent, is the line true. "Great wits
are sure to madness near allied.” The great
wit is never actually mad, but he is often
psychasthenic, and would pass among his
friends for an eccentric.
The psychasthenic is often the most
lovable of men. There must have
been something in the gruff old bear
whom we know as Bam Johnson to
make people love him. Probably his harsh
criticisms sounded less ferocious from his
lips than they do in cold print. Charles
I.amb is proverbial for his sweetness of tem-
per ; and undoubtedly Beethoven, in the in-
tervals of casting rice-pudding at the cook,
was warm-hearted. Men afflicted with psych-
asthenia appear to be incapable of making
money. They are sometimes great artists,
even very great; but money either does not
come their way, or slips through their fin-
gers as soon as earned.
But sooner or later some woman captures
the psychasthenic, as Mr. H. L. Mencken
would have it; though the brave fellow goes
t ) his grave in the full and certain surety
that he has captured the woman for his wife.
It is then that you see woman at her best:
for, though he firmly believes that he is sup-
porting her, though in his unworldliness he
is hardly capable of supporting himself, yet
she does far more for him than support him :
she protects him from an unfeeling world,
which would laugh at his eccentricities. She
teaches him when it is allowable to dream,
and when society demands that he shall wake
up and be polite ; when he may hesitate, and
when he must decide; when he should leave
cards; when spend money; when he shall
make friends, and when lie shall turn his
shoulder. She brushes his clothes and sees
that he cleans his ears; she cossets and civil-
ises him; in a word, she mothers him.
though Freud would have us believe that she
is only actuated by sex-impulse. Evidently
sex in woman is widely different from what
it is in man ; for it leads her to the noblest
of actions; and motherhood is not confined to
the product of her womb. Thus I am quite
prepared to believe that old Mrs. Porter, she
of the red face and mountainous bosom, made
Johnson a perfect wife, overlooking his eccen-
tricities for the joy of seeing that he did
not make an absolute fool of himself; and
that when she died his grief was such that
he never fully recovered from it.
Johnson died of high blood-pressure; the
actual end was due to a mild pneumonia.
The blood-pressure, if not nervous, was pro-
bably due to his excessive eating and drink
ing, and for how many years it had been
mounting it is impossible to Say. To us his
greatness now appears to have somewhat
dwindled. The famous style that seemed
so marvellous to his contemporaries now
rather appears lumbering and over Latin-
ised, and certainly not so vigorous as Swift’s
or Hume’s. His criticisms are not always
so certain as they seemed, and his famous
defence of Christian evidences would cer-
tainly not have satisfied Voltaire, nor his re-
futation of Berkeley. He survives largely
as a personality, made famous through Bos-
well’s unrivalled Biography, which still re-
mains as the truest and most satisfving of
all biographies: for have I not been able
to diagnose his life and death from it as well
as if he had been sitting in my chair! Bos-
well may have been an “inspired fool.” but
at least he could describe exactly what he
saw; and we must always remember that.
Macaulay wrote in “a style in which it was
impossible to tell the truth.”
A word more about these psychasthenics—
Hamlet was undoubtedly of their number.
Psychasthenics are usually very unhappy.
They are constantly haunted with the fear
of madness; it is well known how Johnson,
in an ecstasy of depression, once thought he
was mad, and could only satisfy bimself that
he was sane by writing Latin' verses in his
wakefulness. In the morning he found every
quantity correct, and so was sure that he
was not insane.

Renunciation.
I.
TO say farewell and then to go,
Knowing that never more in any street
Or house or road, be time or swift or slow,
We two may meet;
To yearn alone across the years
Toward the path that once so glad we trod,
And count each well loved turn through mists
of tears,
And kiss the rod ;
To forward look, and still to know
That not again, through all the time to be,
Shall ever I behold your face, your low
Voice comfort me;
To count each bygone word, each hoarded
look
From those dear eyes, each turn of that
dear head,
And then to close for evermore the book,
And no word said —
O tears to shed!
O dearly loved whom never once within
These arms I took, how can I let
You go, save that if Christ Iiis word must
win
Love pays the debt!

And danger for thy lot.
Though death will ride with thee,
Love’s anguish dwells with me;
Yet must I say Follow on ! Follow on !
But, oh, forget me not.
The rain shall drench thee through,
The cold shall pierce thy reins;
And fear, whose damps bedew,
Shall, shuddering, chill thy veins;
Thou shalt be gorged with filth
Where dead men oozing rot:
And, yet, Follow on ! Follow on!
But, oh, forget me not.
Thy head this hour so high,
To morrow may be low,
This clear and candid eye
In darkness ever go,
These strong, triumphant limbs
Waste in the falling lot;
Yet must I say Follow on!—
But, oh, forget me not.
I shall sit in the dark
What sun may shine o’erhead,
Thy name my only mark
In ways my feet must tread ;
No light save in the spark
Where thy sad camp must be ;
But still. Follow on ! Follow on ;
And, oh, forget not me.
Thy name upon my lips
Shall lie by night and day,
Where love itself unstrips
And feels the whips that flay;
Where fear, and dread, and doubt,
Each after each creep out —
There, in the nights to be,
Must I still say Follow on! Follow on !
But, oh, remember me !

MARY GILMORE.
The Sea.
THE sea she was my nurse when I was
but a little boy;
She tended all my childish needs, and
ever brought me joy.
She strewed the rippled silver sand, for no
one else but me,
With half a hundred treasures rare, the
kindly-hearted sea !
The sea she was my lover coy when I was
scarce a man;
She wove me dreams of victory ere yet the
fight began.
She flung a net of gossamer that drew me to
her knee,
And stole away my callow heart, the sweet,
bewitching sea!
The Sea she was my servant when I came to
man’s estate;
I bade her do my orders, and upon my wishes
wait,
And bear me to the earth’s far ends, wherever
joy might be;
And as I bade her so she did, the loyal,
loving sea.
The sea shall take me to her breast when
comes my watch below,
And teach me all the thousand things no
living man may know,
And use my body as she lists, but set my
spirit free,
And give me thus the gift of gifts—-th e God-
beloved _ sea!

1 PASSED with careless word and smiling
grace
His sin too great for notice —-oh, his
eyes A; >
Were hungry wolves that fixed upon my face
The look a soul remembers till it dies—
Such look as Adam might have bent on Eve
Had she remained in Eden and alone;
Accursed and doomed he hardly could believe
His fate and her desertion. Cold as stone
My heart to his dumb plea. Could I forgive?
Could I bring summer back, rest to the sea,
Restore the prostrate trees and bid them live,
Or keep the sun ? Such craft is not for me.
Not all the waves that roll can cleanse the
stain;
And words of fire or tears of blood are vain.
Now, as the days pass slow, like vacant years,
And summer dies with outstretched arms
of pain
From which her treasures fall, and wind-
swept tears
Whip through the forest trees in scuds of
rain—
Now I am desolate. ’Tis not enough
My woman’s heart for me. What shall
I love?
The tortured, maddened sea, grown tempest
rough,
Dashed on the rocks to curl in pain above
And shivering fall? The stately bending
palms
Before the hissing gust that lays them
low?
The stormy sunset shadowing cloudy calms
Ere night blots out its beauty and its woe?
I will love grief, whom love and grief have
slain ;
And weep for woes I may not feel again !

Mon Roi Est Parti.
THE King of Happy Islands
Came riding from the sea;
He flung a silken spell to catch
The heart of me;
But swift across a sunflower’s rim
I laughed and caught the heart of him !
He stole the sky*s blue ribbon
And wound it in my hair ;
From stolen dreams he made a gown
For me to wear,
And stitched me little shining shoon
With silver stolen from the moon.
For me he stole an hour from time,
He robbed Night’s jewelled feet ;
He set stars in my mouth that I
Might kiss him sweet.
Sure, what had I of witchery
That king should turn to thief for me?
The King of Happy Islands
Rides no more from the sea,
Nor flings a silken spell to catch
The heart of me.
For Grief has kissed my dancing eyes,
And Love has made me sorrow wise.

Under the Thumb.
Looking creation around,
Sizing it up as it runs :
Planets go wheeling around.
Pulled at the will of the suns;
Half of the world goes along
Growling and gloomy and glum,
Having no soul and no definite goal,
Tight under somebody’s thumb.
Jones is a hero at home,
The seat by the fire is his throne ;
He barks in his wrath at the cat in his path,
Full as a bladder up-blown ;
Soon as he’s back in the shop,
The frown of the boss has him dumb.
Why is he mute who was loud on the flute?
Perhaps it’s because of a thumb.
Brown is a pillar of State
(We are the spawn of the clod ) ;
If lie’s not one of the great,
Why do we shake at his nod?
Yet a small woman at home
All on his fibres can strum;
Let him sing low or she’ll soon let him know
Whom she has under her thumb.
Up in that villa so fine
Goldenberg lives at his ease;
Lackeys trot round at his nod,
Agile and busy as fleas;
Neighbors think “Goldie” a prince,
Crawl at his boots for a crumb ;
Yet there are those who can tweak at his
nose—
Isn’t he under their thumb?
And let us turn where we will,
Ever we find it the same;
No one is free of the squeeze,
Here in the heart of the game;
Even old Satan, who fell
Down from his eminence plumb,
Right from that date has been cursing his
fate,
Crushed under Somebody’s Thumb.

* Floating white as a flower,
And, opal and pearl,
Glint the lees of the shower.
The weathercock turns
Where he poses aloof,
And, glorious, burns
O’er the glittering roof,
To see at his feet,
In glossy arraying,
Their drama discreet
Most daintily playing,
A nymph with two swains
Amorous to delight her—
The clouds o’er the vanes
Are no softer and whiter.
His love each relates
With murmurous sobbing,
As up the wet slates
They go pacing and bobbing.
But one is too rash !
Elusive, she springs
Aloft with a flash
And clip-clapping of wings
<k
To wheel in the sun
With the soft whir of laughter,
And the swains, all undone,
And bereft, hurry after.
Then the clouds gather grey,
Drooping low, sorrow-brimmed ;
The sun slips away
And the splendors are dimmed,
And the weathercock veers
With a creak and a groan,
As the sky drops its tears
On him musing. . . .alone !

Phantom Horses.
THERE’S a crowd of wild bush horses
that are breaking for the trees,
With a jet-black brumby stallion in the
van ;
And he leads them thund’ring onward, proud
mane flying to the breeze,
Fiery nostrils snorting challenges to Man.
I can feel the clean air sweeping
As my horse and I go leaping,
A ith a surging plunge and tightened rein,
across some fallen tree.
I can feel my fingers fumble,
As we shudder, pause and stumble,
At an empty water gilgi, right ourselves, and
gallop free.
I can see the brumbies falter, with their
flanks white-flecked with foam,
As we head them by the gullies on their
wing;
See the mob swing round, defeated, gallop
break-neck speed for home,
Hills and ridges to the stockwhip echoing:
Gallop, swerve and turn like thunder,
With the rushing bushland under,
As we gain the open country with the brum-
bies well in hand.
And my blood and brain are surging,
Earth and skv are intermerging... .
When a London ’bus recalls me, and I lose
that phantom band.
Well, I’ve had my dream and vision, and I
shall be satisfied
To ride along the track that Life has
planned,
Though the cattle-bells are calling me by Mur-
rumbidgee’s side
To the things I know and love and under-
stand.
And however hard Life’s course is
I can chase those phantom horses
Through the yellow fog o’ London, watch
them tear across the plain,
See the jet-black stallion lead them.
Feel the rushing breezes speed them,
And in fancy I am riding there again.

I Have Lived.
I HAVE drunk, deep and oft, of the
I draught of regret,
Which, once having tasted, no man
may forget;
I have worn the hai’d shackles of danger and
debt,
And the brand of their burning still marks
me—and yet
I have lived ! I have lived ! Life has given
to me
To pass where the breeze of the tropic blows
free;
To watch the sun drop like a pear from a
tree,
A red ripened pear, o’er the rim of the sea;
To feel a ship rise to the swell of the bay
And sway ’neath my feet as she swings on
her way;
To see a full thousand of porpoises play
In the warm Caribbean and toss it in spray.
I have taken the calm that the worshipper
knows
From the wonderful shrine in the heart of
a rose,
And have found it again in the glory that
glows
In the still-marching stars or the white of
the snows.
The friendship of books and the thrill of the
line
Which, wrought by a mortal, lives on half-
divine ;
The arts of fond women, the warmth of good
wine,
I have known —and for ever that knowledge
is mine.
The red hills of Devon, the trenches of
France ;
The East with its glamor, Horae’s quiet
Romance,
The surf with its thunderous, long-leagued
advance;
The grip of a hand and the lure of a glance ;
The plains in the autumn, the hills ’neatli
the moon;
The rush of the ducks from the reeded
lagoon;
The stir of the morning, the hush of high
noon ;
The pangs of the lover and labor’s good boon;
Cool sleep and warm kisses, the mateship
of men,
And music’s mad magic; the eggs of the
wren,
And the lovely things born of paint, pencil
and pen,
Have stirred me, have stilled me, again and
again.
I have mated and known the dear ties of
the wed ;
I have fathered fair sons who shall after
me tread—
And when the last shadows close over my
head
I shall cry,, as I go to my place with the
dead :
“I have lived, I have suffered, been crowned
and been cross’d ;
Felt the kiss of the sun and the bite of the
frost;
Been rocked in calm waters, by tempests
been toss’d ;
But in living I profited more than I lost.
Past all question or doubt
I have reasoned it out:
My life has been worth to me more than
it cost!”

Aphrodite.
THOUGH from blue-green gulfs upborne
(Gulfs of fin and narwhale horn,
Gulfs of million-spawning life,
And of dreadful, speechless strife),
Earth is mine, where’er I pass
O’er her tapestries of grass.
Rounded hilltops, blossom-sweet,
Are a footstool for my feet;
Every lake my mirror lies,
Giving back my blue-green eyes,
And my hair of auburn gold.
At the core my eyes are cold —
Cold as ocean’s Stygian deep
Whose warmthless hungers never sleep—
But their melting iris gleams
Like woven sea and forest dreams,
Mixed with subtle, amber fire
Of lazy leonine desire.
Lean-flanked lions, seeking blood,
Follow me by field and flood ;
But about my flawless face
Beating wings, of tender grace,
Fill the air with summer snow,
Joy before, behind me woe.
(Oh, the shadowed loves that lie
Woodland-hid as I pass by!—
Amorous struggle, broken words,
’Neath the flight of mating birds!)
I o’erdrive the panting breast,
I inspire the fever-quest;
All your transient flames are mine—
Steady nlood I turn to wine,
Wing the limbs and blind the eyes,
Mix the valley with the skies,
Spur the quick and rouse the dead,
Flush the pale of life with red.
I, the all-oppressing goo.
Slender, naked and unshod!
Where my doves have brought delight
Come my lions with the night:
Rape and murder, madness, lust,
Scattered tresses .■ mixed with dust;
Blood that runs and creeps and drips,
Salt of blood on bitten lips;
Obscene tortures, nameless pangs,
Scourges, daggers, cords and fangs.
I, the Sea-Born, I am great,
Love before, behind me hate!
Shade the eyes, and pause, and see—
Lo! a Man draws near to me!
My rose-wreath is red as morn—
He is crowned with barren thorn.
My lions slink, my doves have flown;
Before His face I stand alone.
Down, ah, down! as vanquished strength
To the victor kneels at length.
Gentle as a child at last,
All my pride is overpast.
With my tresses, summer-sweet,
Lo! I wipe His dusty feet.

The Gifting Tree.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
"PIIE King of Kandy’s daughter
I Has sailed upon the sea,
For she would roam the oceans round
To seek the Gifting Tree.
Oh, blossoms white as moonbeams,
With gift of lands and gold—
Who of the amber fruit shall eat
Will know delight untold !
The King of Kandy’s daughter
Has sailed in the clear morn;
The boat’ is all of rosy wood
Upon the blue waves borne;
The sails are white as seafoam,
And the night-black cloud behind
Is the hair of the King’s young daughter
Caught in the swift sea-wind.
They have reached the Isle of Beauty
Where the flowers can never die,
But there is not a Gifting Tree
Beneath the mackerel sky.
They have found the Isle of Wonder,
So lonely and so rare,
But there grows not a Gifting Tree
Among the marvels there.
They have reached the Land of Laughter,
And the Cape of High Desire,
But never there the Gifting Tree
Has raised a slender spire;
And all the Isles of Pleasure
They have sailed afar to see,
But never one has held Avithin
The wished-for Gifting Tree.
And the King of Kandy’s daughter
Has homeward turned the prow,
With tears upon her pallid cheeks,
And grief upon her brow;
It is a year and ninety days
Since she went forth to roam;
And in the glowing west she sees
The dawn-light on her home.
‘ But what,” said the little Princess,
“Is the tree upon the lawn
That glows so green and golden
In the long rays of the dawn?”
“And, oh,” they said, “sweet Princess,
It is a wondrous tree
That grew for consolation
When you sailed out to sea.
“The foam-white bloom falls thickly
When autumn winds blow cold;
No man dare pluck such fragrance
Or eat the fruit of gold;
Its wonder and its beauty
Are famed from sea to sea;
The Wise Men of the Holy Hill
They cannot name this tree.”
"Stay!” said the little Princess
(And she spoke on bended knee),
“This tree it is none other than
My far-sought Gifting Tree;
Tt grew, while far I wandered
Beneath the sky’s wide dome,
To tell me all good gifts are found
Within the gates of home.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
WHEN young Jimmy Lake —“Carroty
Jimmy”—tirst went to school in
Parramatta, in 1832, that picturesque
suburb of Sydney was very far from being
suburban. It was an inland town of real
and considered importance in New South
Wales. Not many years before it had been
the second place in Australia, but by 1835
Hobart Town, in Van Diemen’s Land, had
begun to rival it. Nevertheless, it was still,
alternately with Sydney, the seat of govern-
ment of all Eastern Australia, where the
Governor-General spent a great deal of his
time in the white house in the Park from
which emanated the laws, ordinances and de-
crees that more or less affected the whole of
the continent and the
islands of NeAv Zea-
land. It Avas a little
village then, nearly all
built upon the south
side of the river,
across which a loav-
set wooden bridge car
vied the road to th
Havvkesbury throug
Castle Hill, a show
way below where Mi.
David Lennox was en-
gaged in constructing
the fine stone arch
that spans the river
and bears his name
to-day. On the north-
ern bank, near the
bridge, Avhere there is
a small park on the
av est e r n side of
Church-street, stood
the gaol, and in the
open space before that
dismal edifice were
the stocks. Parson
Marsden dwelt in a
big brick rectory on
the hillside south of
St. John’s. Nash’s
and Airs. Walker’s
inns were.close to the
church, and there
Avere only small houses
—-mostly one-storeyed
cottages —r everywhere
around, with the ex-
ception of a tAVO-
storeyed one belonging
to Mr. Oakes, lately
(’hief Constable.
Upon the corner of George and Church
streets, the original wooden phurch had stood,
but it disappeared in ’35, and a courthouse
took its place.
Old St. John’s Avas built of brick, stuccoed
over with a facing of plaster, of the sort
that may be seen in the tAvin toAvers with
the dumpy spires at the western end of the
present building, Avhich are all that is left
of the original. Within were high, square
pews like little sheep-pens. Galleries Avere
upon either side, one of which, during ser-
vices, was occupied by prisoners of the
Crown, and the other by boys of the King’s
School. A high pulpit, ’a three-decker, stood
in the middle of the church, with the reading
desk below it, and the clerk’s desk lower
still, upon the floor. It was a gloomy, dark
interior, inadequately lit by narrow slits of
windows. The church had been called St.
John’s in honor of old Governor Hunter,
during whose reign it had been built —as St.
Phillip’s, in Sydney, had been named after
Captain Arthur Phillip. In those early days
the Governors, armed with God-like powers,
were quite the biggest saints in the Calendar.
They were much more entitled to have
churches named after them than any of the
Four Evangelists.
When little Carroty Jimmy came to board
at the King’s School from his home near
Cobbity, with his mop of ginger hair and
his freckled, combative face, he was only
12 years old, and the school had been started
but three months. It was housed, first of all,
and remained for four years, in a roomy
place in lower George-street, which is there
yet, and is curiously like the stone building
that was being erected in the Cherry Gar-
dens on the northern side of the darn that
was constructed by Lieut. Watts of the
Royal Engineers. A square, Georgian house
it is, with overhanging eaves, five bare win-
dows in the upper storey, and four and a
door below. There are many such dwellings
surviving in Parramatta, and they might
all have been called, very appropriately,
Bleak House, for solidity and bleakness are
the only striking features of their architec-
ture.
The first boarders at the school were
Andrew McDougall, Edwin Suttor, George
Rouse, Joseph Thompson, James Walker
and Charles Lockyer, and there were six
day-boys—two Orrs, George Macarthur (who
became headmaster in 18G9), John Watsford
and two Oakeses. It was in charge of the
Rev. Robert Forrest, M.A., and Mrs. For-
rest was the first matron.
Long Bob and slender Jane,
One gives physic and the other cane —
the boys used to sing of them; but they were
a very fine and worthy couple, and did great
things for the school in its beginnings.
“I wish,” writes an Old Boy, who was
there with Carroty Jimmy—“l wish I could
present my readers with some portraits of
the boys who came to the school. Knicker-
bockers were unknown. Short jackets were
worn, and often the little fellows had the
jacket buttoned up and the trousers, or ‘pan-
taloons,’ as Mrs. Forrest called them, but-
toned over it; the suit generally made of
blue cloth. One boy had jacket and trousers
all in one, made of brown holland, with
buttons only at the back of the neck and
waist. The suit gave him a cool appearance
on a hot summer’s day, and Parramatta was
as hot a place as I was ever in.
“Some of the boys wore large pinafores.
At nine years old I used to wear, over my
long-trousered cloth suit, a brown holland
pinafore, down to my ankles nearly. All
we pinafore-wearing boys had girls’ names
given to us, by way of nickname.
“The caps worn were of a peculiar style,
having small leather peaks and large crowns
with a cane round them, the pleats drawn
into the centre to a button. After a time
these canes would be taken out, and then the
caps used to hang loose at the side of the
head. One boy, John Antill, who at once
received the nickname of ‘Magpie,’ came
with a home-made cap, the upright made of
square pieces of cloth—black, white and red,
with an immense cane top, no peak, and a
ribbon at one side. Older lads wore what
were called ‘black billies’ —the usual beaver
or silk hats.”
Many things this Old Boy tells us of his
schooldays-—he was afterwards the Rev.
James Hassall, for a long time chaplain at
Berrima Gaol —that give us an insight into
what manner of human beings King’s School
boys were nearly a hundred years ago. “Morn-
ing, noon and night,” he says, “we had to
learn the everlasting Eton Latin Grammar
—parrot-like, as we learnt the Church
Catechism.” He tells, first-hand, the story
of what is now a famous tradition that has
been extraordinarily garbled and exagger-
ated :
One St. Patrick’s Day the boys barred Mr. Forrest
out of the schoolroom, because he had refused to
give them a half-holiday. He was furious when he.

found the door closed against him. Shortly after
this, Mrs. Forrest came to a window and said that
Mr. Forrest was dressing- to go for Colonel Despavd
and the soldiers, so they quickly opened the door
and took their seats. He came into the school, I
remember, in his Sunday-going- clothes, which shewed
that he really had intended to carry out his purpose.
It was a queer, mixed and picturesque society
in the old toAvn 90-odd years ago. Mainly,
it consisted of a prison population, and of
the soldiers and officials Avho guarded and
regulated it. But Sir Richard Bourke lived

Lake’s young life. There Avas nothing auburn

Hassall as giving him a cool appearance on
hot days; but Avhatever of coolness his rai-
ment might have expressed was amply com-
pensated for by the extreme heat of his head-
piece.
A cruel joke was played upon him by an
army surgeon named Stewart, at the be-
ginning of his second term at school. This
sorry wag, affecting to sympathise with
“Jemima Ginger” in the ceaseless ribald
chaffing which had led him into many battles
with his fellows, persuaded the sensitive
youngster to have his hair dyed black.
“Let me fix you up, young Jimmy-my-lad,”
he had suggested pleasantly to the boy, upon
making his acquaintance in the home of his
aunt —good Mrs. Hurford, of Waterloo Villa,
near Elizabeth Farm —-and receiving shy con-
fidences concerning his miseries. “I’ll guar-
antee ye a wig as black as my own. Ye’ll
have no trouble aftenvards. ’Twill save ye
lots o’ fights, I do assure ye. You let me
do it. for ye. I’ll be only too glad.
“Oh, I don’t mind the fightin’, sir. The
fellows fight about anything,” young Jimmy
had responded solemnly. “But I’d like to
look like other chaps. Even the town cads
sing out after me when I’m in the street.
And the girls grin and giggle at me. An’
old Forrest calls me ‘Rufus.’ He got as
funny as 1 o’clock about me the other day
Avhen we was doin’ English history—about
William the Second, sir. It’s a bit rough
on a cove.”
“Of course it is, my boy—of course it
is. ’Tis not to be endured. Going down to
my surgery at the Barracks after sick parade
on Sunday morn-
ing, and I’il fix you
up so that your
mother wouldn’t
know you had red
hair. Ye’ll be the
envy of the town
when I’ve done with
ye. I’ll fix ye up."
And so lie did—-
perhaps not inten-
tionally—in such a
way that poor
Jimmy Lake had
to endure a hell ten
times worse than
that which had
gone before. The
black dye did not
blend as it should
have done with the
color scheme of
Jimmy’s ' thick
mop, and the pro-
cess of pigmenta-
tion turned his hair
into a shade of
puce, a sort of
purple. So terrific
was the persecution
this led to that he
ran a w a y from
school and fled to
his aunt’s house,
refusing to return
to his fellows until
his hair should
have regained its
natural scarlet
brilliancy. If to be
a Jemima Ginger
was hard enough,
it was infinitely
harder to he called
a Purple Emperor!
Mrs. Hurford laughingly informed Mr. For-
rest of the catastrophe, and they agreed that
Jimmy must be allowed to absent himself
from school until such time—and it took two
months—as his wig might revert from arti-
ficiality to nature. But Mr. Forrest did
not laugh when he addressed Dr. Stewart on
the subject. His scathing sarcasms were too
much for the medico’s temper.
“Damme, sir,-” he said, “if ’twere not for
your cloth, I’d call you out!”
“And damn you, sir,” replied the Rev.
Robert Forrest, heatedly, “if ’twere not foi
my cloth I’d take my cane to you !”
For a long time there Avas a coolness be-
tween the headmaster of the King’s School
and surgeon Andrew Stewart, of II.M. 4th
Regiment of Foot, over Jimmy Hake’s pei-
verted locks. A distinct coolness, so that
only the most frigid of salutations were
exchanged when they met.
In the year of Queen Victoria’s accession
to the throne, Jimmy Lake had been five
years at the King’s School, and had de-
veloped from a little ginger-headed shrimp of
4ft. 6in., in a Holland garment and a pina-
fore, into a strapping young Cornstalk ol
Gft. lin., and 14 stone in weight, who wore
a beaver “black billy,” a cutaway coat with
brass buttons and the bearing and mien
of a full-grown, athletic young man. Even
to-day many Australian boys grow like that.
In the second generation of White Australia
i hey were more common than they are now.
And. more than that, though his close-
cropped, shapely head was still a vivid color-
note in the scenery, he had become a very
handsome young man, as fully developed in
the essentials of manhood as any male youth
five years his senior. There were no boys
in the school now who found it diverting to
exercise their wit upon his carroty nob.
And the only youths in the town who ever ven-
tured to do it were strangers, and they were
never long in learning the inexpediency and
rashness of such behavior. For Jimmy was
a mighty man of his fists, hard of thew and
sinew, active, agile and very nimble.
“Yus.” said _ Tom Gately, ex-prizefighter
and landlord of the Currency Lad, out near
the Windsor toll-bar, “gimme a boy like that
there young gemman, an’ I’d make hany-
think out o’ ’im. A proper young covey ’e
is. Quick, game, an ’ hactive. Lor’ lumme,
with a year’s trainin’ in my ’ands I’d match
’im ag’in Tom Cribb ’isself, an’ back ’im to
win wiv me larst ’alf-c-rown.”
But there were others than Tom Gately
who admired the fine physique of young Jin;
Lake —others who did not have cauliflower
ears and broken noses and mutton-chop side-
whiskers and hands like little legs of mut-
ton and breaths that smelled of gin-and-
water. In particular, there Avas that charm-
ing and seductive grass-Avidow, Mrs. Philip
Sugden, wife of Captain Sugden, of his
Majesty’s 28th Regiment, who Avas away on
detachment duty at Norfolk Island.
When a voluptuous, not to say sensuous,
woman of 30 falls violently in love with a
Avell-developed boy of 17 there is much dan-
ger for the latter—great and exceeding dan-
ger, both in the present and the future. The
danger does not lie so much in his possible
seduction —sooner or later that will happen
to him, anyhoAV. It lies rather in the fact
that he is liable to lose those illusions of
adolescent manhood concerning the opposit*
sex which are at once its best and its worst
attributes. He incurs the risk of entering
upon real manhood as a maudlin sentimen
talist or a cynical young blackguard.
Mrs. Sugden was a pretty siren—fair and
pink-cheeked and red-lipped, and altogether
attractive to any age of healthy masculinity.
She was unscrupulous and thoroughly un-
moral. Her world must contain a man, or
it was not a world suited for the needs of her
existence. And so, when she met this boy-
ish Greek god, she set herself to his capture
with a zest and enthusiasm that even sur-
prised herself. And she succeeded in sur-
prising the normal and healthy-minded
Jimmy in a fashion that was not to him
altogether without its delightful aspects.

The Right Reverend William Grant
Broughton, Doctor of Divinity and first


Bishop of Australia of the Established
Church, had lunched with his Excellency Sir
Bichard Bourke, and, coming away from
Government House early in the afternoon,
had found himself minded to take a stroll
through Parramatta Park on his way to pay
a call upon the Bev. Bobert Forrest, at the
King’s School, which was now installed in
the severe and ugly, but much beloved, stone
building on the north side of the river, oppo-
site the Hospital, where it has remained ever
since. It was a Saturday afterncon, and a
half-holiday at the school, so he knew that
he would find the busy headmaster disen-
gaged. The Bishop was the founder of the
school—he had meant to have a similar in-
stitution in Sydney, but that did not come
off for nearly 60 years, when the Church of
England Grammar School was established —
and took great interest in it. There were
many matters he was desirous of discussing
with Mr. Forrest. Matters that were to
count for much in the years that were to
come.
Bound by the pleasant orchard in the
Crescent—the horseshoe bend in the higher
bank of the river just below Government
House —along the avenue of young oaks that
are so beautiful to-day in their maturity,
his Lordship of Australia took his thoughtful
way that summer afternoon in the beginning
of ’37. There were many things to be pon-
dered over. In all the Christian world no
prelate had such a vast and extensive diocese
as his. Nobody can look at his portrait
hanging in the dining-hall at the King’s
School to-day—that earnest, wistful, ascetic,
kindly face —without realising that William
Broughton was a man who recognised his
responsibilities in the fullest, and strove
valiantly to fulfil them. Such walks alone
as this, communing with his God and with
himself, were very precious to the Bishop.
“Ah! What was that?”
Up on the bank above him, on the left-hand
side, he had caught the gleam of a gingham
dress flashing whitely in the sunlight against
the green grass of the hillside, and amongst
the darker green of little shrubby bushes
growing here and there up the slope. And
a brilliant blob of orange-red glowed also
amongst the bushes in the sunlight. Involun-
tarily the Bishop stopped and stared.
There were two people up on a ledge in
the bank, and they were obviously quite un-
conscious of his presence below them. A
young man and a very pretty golden-haired
lady, and the young man’s arms were about
the yielding form of the lady, and he was
engaged in kissing her red lips with much
fervor. And she was reciprocating earnestly.
Above all things, William Broughton was
a gentleman, and had no desire to spy upon
any man or woman, whatever they might be
doing. But lie was so astounded by this
unexpected spectacle that he could only stand
and stare, whilst slowly across his ill-
adjusted consciousness stole the knowledge
that he knew them both.
“Major Lake’s boy!” he gasped to him-
self. “And—why, bless my soul! —’tis Mrs.
Philip Sugden—Captain Sugden’s wife—
and he is away in Norfolk Island!”
As soon as he realised so much as this
lie reddened at the thought that, whatever of
evil might be toward, he was unwittingly
playing the eavesdropper, the Peeping Tom.
Shaking his head in a vexed fashion he
stepped into the roadway, and turned his
back upon the guilty pair above him. He
began to move along the way he had been
going, when, suddenly, from behind a bush,
Mrs. Sugden’s fox-terrier dashed, yapping and
barking, down the slope, and began to assail
his gaiters.
There came a shrill scream from the bank,
and the light dress hid itself instantly behind
an adjacent clump of briar. Simultaneously
a tall athletic figure came bounding down
the bank, holding a beaver hat in one hand,
and with a startled face that was nearly as
red as the crop of ginger hair above it. With
the hat the young man “shooed” the dog
away, and then stood bashfully before the
Bishop, miserably confused and embarrassed,
his eyes upon the ground, and such shame
as only a boy can feel or show evident in all
his attitude and bearing. On the bank above
was no visible sign of Mrs. Sugden.
For a few moments the Bishop and the
boy stood opposite to one another, unspeak-
ing. Then William Broughton pulled him-
self together and stepped forward, holding
out his hand.
“My dear Jim Lake,” he said gently, “hew
glad lam to see you ! Thank you for saving
me from this ferocious beast. Evidently he,
is not in harmony with the Church—what?
I was beginning to fear for my new gaiters
when you so opportunely saved the situation.
WOMEN’S FASHIONS.
JOHN O' THE ISLANDS: “The people where
I — ah — conic- from. — don’t go in much
for clothing. For instance, a girl’s cos-
tume consists of a piece of cloth eight
yards long.”
HELEN O' TOORAK: “What do they do with
the seven yards that are over?”
Dear me, I don’t know what I’d have done.
Come, I am going to the school. Will you
not walk there with me across the Upper Dam
and by the Baceeourse? I should be de-
lighted with your company. Ah—the little
dog has disappeared. Doesn’t he belong to
you ?”
“No, sir—no, my Lord ; he belongs—he
I mean he doesn’t belong to me,” floundered
poor Jimmy.
“I see. lie just happened to be here and
didn’t like my looks, eh? Well, well —come
along, my dear lad. I met your father yesterday
in Sydney. He was going to the Prisoners’
Barracks, looking for laborers. Hard to
obtain just now, I believe —Major Mitchell
takes such a lot of them for his new roads,
they tell me. Your father desired me to
give you his love, and entrusted me with
half-a-guinea for you. Here it is. Come
along. Let us step out. I have a good deal
to say to Mr. Forrest. What an afternoon
it is! Perfect. Delightful. And the Park
looks so well just now.”
So they crossed the river by the low cause-
way near the Women’s Factory, and then
walked across the Baceeourse to the school,
the Bishop chatting cheerfully all the time,
and miserable and unhappy Jimmy Lake —
sometimes crimson-cheeked and sometimes
very pale—walking beside him, mumbling
almost inarticulate replies when he could
not avoid doing so. But Dr. Broughton gave
no indication that he noticed anything amiss.
When they came into the school grounds
the Bishop shook hands with the dejected
Jimmy.
“Good-bye, my boy,” he said. “Good luck !
I must hasten into Mr. Forrest or I may
miss him. Good-bye.”
Jimmy raised his tophat and muttered his
leave-taking.
“That boy !” whispered the Bishop to him-
self as he crossed the playground. “Now, God
help him !”
At bedtime Jimmy Lake received two
notes. One of them, on pink, scented paper,
read: —•
Deary Jimmy,—Fancy the old devil! I hope he
won’t tell. — Flora.
And the other was:—
My dear Lake,- —God guard and keep you always,
and help you to play the man. From your sincere
triend.— William Australia.
HARD LUCK.
“Is it true that you have races here to-morrow?”
“Yell; but you’re too late to enter him—entries closed yesterday .”
“He is a man !” muttered Jimmy to him-
self as he pulled the sheet over his head—
because of the fierce Parramatta mosquitoes.

The Passing of Elder
Man’s Lane.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ELDEB MAN’S LANE, which I once
wrote a series of sketches about, has
vanished since then. Scarce a ves-
tige of it remains. The old track has been
widened, and the ancient land-marks have
been removed—most of them altogether, the
rest of them in part. An old prison-like
wharf warehouse, built of stones that might
have been cut for the Pyramids, and mighty
hardwood beams that might have been
squared for bridges, has been crow-barred
and craned and lorried and lightered away.
But there is left an old cottage with flower-
garden space in front and a little side plot
with a garden chair, long since hopelessly
coated with thick, hot, greasy dust. And
other little old blind sheds. And, last, prop-
ped back flat against a high bank on spidery
balcony posts, an old, two-storeyed dwelling,
with windows boarded up, that has been
deserted for years—except by ghosts. It
reminds one of a withered spider in a dry,
dusty, cob-webbed vine. Perhaps sailors
stumbled into its parlor in days gone by,
and, maybe, more than one was carried out
and down in the small hours, and
gently slipped into the harbor. Yes. That
old lane, leading darkly to darker landing-
places, saw things, and heard things whis-
pered—maybe, on occasion, heard them
thudded and groaned and shrieked.
Elder Man’s Lane has disappeared. In
place of a crooked, dusty (or muddy) gut-
ter that ended at an old horse-and-cart
punt, there is a broad curving street —one
of the best in Sydney—with a deep founda-
tion, and two wide kerbed footways, where
once there was room for only one lone way-
farer at a time. It sweeps down round
Dawes Point (scornfully unconscious now
of the horse-punt
and all its old
humble usefulness),
round between
a steeply - sloping
grassy park and a
solidly ornamental
sandstone sea-wall
with a very orna-
mental railing on
top, to where the
latest liners of the
world lie alongside
up-to-date landings,
with windows and
balconies, so that
flapper trippers
may say good-bye
to their friends and
run no danger of
having their frocks
soiled by contact
with dirty hand-
true k-m e n and
other grimy toilers.
I may be preju-
diced, but to my
mind half the
romance in sailing
away to foreign
lands consisted in
your cab being
forced jerkily and
anxiously and at
what you thought
the last moment,
down throug h
crowded and strenuous lanes, between
jambed lorries, to narrow, blind water-
ways, and long, dark, tarry, greasy, wharf-
smelling sheds, packed high with all sorts
of merchandise; where you had to run the
gauntlet of charging hand-trucks, and friends
perched on cases and bales; where you ran
across to frowsy little sailors’ pubs and had
farewell drinks with pals. What a wide
world of pathos, partings, hope, despair and
throat-swelling heart-break there was about
those old wharves and sheds! Now taxi-
cabs sweep down round the Appian Way
where Elder Man’s Lane was, and motor-
cars loaded with wealth and dressing-cases
and golf-clubs; and rows of cabs line the sea
wall by the blue harbor. Very different
from my Elder Man’s Lane-—and very differ-
ent people.
They are to go by Table Mountain and
cloudy Teneriffe (“to avoid the heat and
discomfort of the Bed Sea”) ; or by the
broad Pacific; maybe by our own mysterious
straits, and so to Colombo, with its tropical
avenues, and its queer impression of coolness
and darkness in tropic heat; and molten
Aden, with its glistening bronze statues come
aboard with papers, and nothing much else
except a loincloth; and so by Suez and Port
Said; and Naples, with its long straight
lines of lights, and its great Casino aglow;
and old Vesuvius smoking uneasily, uncom-
fortably and discontentedly by night, as if
his bed was too hard and knobby and he was
troubled by heat and mosquitoes; and smok-
ing impatiently and fretfully by day. as if
he was tortured by the troubles of Europe.
And Genoa —pronounce the G as softly and
lingeringly as you can —Genoa where mules
go up streets too steep for anything else,
and trams run through ornamented tunnels
and archways. The deep, cool streets of
Genoa, where I —but never mind about
that.
You’d be surprised at the people you meet
now on Elder Man’s Lane. One day re-
cently it was an ex-constable, with his wife
and a motor-car and a lot of new luggage.
Going Home. I fancy I knew how he felt
about it. The end of his lane had nearly
come. It was a long lane, some 60 years
or so, with bushrangers’ rifles in the rocks
at one side of it more than once, when the
old officer was a trim young mounted-trooper,
and revolvers in dark city by-ways in later
years. (I was reminded a little further
back of the pathetic way in which some old
ex-polioemen, in neat sac suits of grey, haunt
the vicinity of their last beats.) My old
friend brought me round to his side of the
car with a sideways jerk of his head.
“Good-bye, Mrs. Holloway; I wish you a
pleasant voyage.”
“ Tlia-ank you, Mr. Lawrence! Good-
bye. I hope you are keeping well.” (This
one for me !)
And maybe she, too, has in her time
faced a gang of roughs and sent them about
their business with nothing more than the
uncanny nerve of the Englishwoman of her
type.
But Holloway stealthily slips down by the
wheel a flask of whisky. And then I remem-
ber the tale of a friend of mine who, poor
HER GOLDEN CHARMS.
“George said he did not see where your attraction lay, but I stuck
up for you.”
“You darling! What did you say?”
“I said it lay in your bank.”
devil! fell into trouble and was facing the
ordeal in front of him badly. It was Hollo-
way who was looking after him, and there
was something suspiciously like a strong
nip in the tot of water he passed into the
cell that morning. The Force is full of very
human Holloways.
So they run off the punt and swing round
out of Elder Man’s Lane towards where the
liner lies in her pride at Dawes Point.
Elder Man’s Lane has gone, but my own
shadowy people seem to go up there still.
The ghost of Benno, noblest of bottle-os, and
his horse and cart, are making home to the
Old Uns. I haven’t seen Benno in the flesh
for a year or two. Perhaps the Old Uns
have gone up-country and Benno is looking
after some young uns somewhere —a sister’s
or a brother’s, maybe—with no young Benno
growing up to look after himj the possibility
of such a young Benno having been sacrificed
long ago for the sake of the aforesaid Old
Uns. He’ll be all right when he gets to the
end of life’s Elder Man’s Lane. And the
Mystery of Asia slips past in the spirit
of Ah Dam, with his pockets full of opium,
to be absorbed by an equally drifting,
shadowy but friendly jim-jam. I can’t say
what will become of Ah Dam in the end. His
is a different Heaven. And the wraith of the
poor, bruised and stained Lily of St.
Leonards, slipping back to her earthly hell,
after the manner of Martha in “David Cop-
per field.” She’ll be all right hereafter.
That’ll be our lookout. And the shamed
shade of Johnson —won’t some sober soul
who knew him plead the good resolutions,
the brave battles, the fierce remorse, the
generosity, sympathy and Christian charity
of this drunkard?
And-—oh, yes ! —the spook of Henry
Lawson, bound for the Lord knows where ;
with a couple of old magazines carefully
rolled in brown paper and carried down
Blue’s Point-road to give his creditors the
impression that he is taking some new stuff
over to The Bulletin and will presently;
return with a cheque. Let me see! It used;
to be: “I plead guilty, your Worship; and I
want to make a statement.” How will it,
be? “I plead guiU.., Lord, and I want toj
make a statement’" No. no statement will'
be necessary then. Or: “I want time to pay,
Lord”? But then it will be too late.
HENRY LAWSON.
Valley Green.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN sunset fell on London town —
London town with the amber mist,
And St. Paul’s a dome of amethyst,
All in a frame of summer brown —
I knew where Valley Green was lying,
A mile to the south by the swallows’ flying;
Valley Green with the poplars slender,
And a purple twilight warm and tender,
Full of quiet and silver sighing.
But I went out on many seas—
Sea of the Morning and Sea of the Noon,
And the smoky sea of the great white moon,
And the blue sea where the memories
Are drowned deep with a soft dying—-
And Valley Green was always lying
Near to my waking and near to my
sleeping,
The sacred thing in its warm keeping,
Full of quiet and silver sighing.
And I was lost in many lands —
Land of Iron and Land of Gold
And the misty Land of Far-to-hohl—
With grey wind in both my hands ;
And always a voice in my ears crying
Of Valley Green, winding and lying
Where the dreams broaden and day's
feather
Flies on an arrow of blue weather,
Full of quiet and silver sighing.
When sunset fades on Sydney town —
Sydney town in a ruby of fire
And opal glowing with all desire
Into the milky shadows that drown
Boof on roof in the dusk dying—
I know that Valley Green is lying
Under the poplar columns slender.
In a brown twilight warm and tender,
Full of quiet and silver sighing.
If I should walk a turn in my heart —
Heart of iron and heart of gold
And foolish heart that cannot hold
Its laughter and its tears apart—
Always I come when day is dying
On Valley Green, trembling and lying
Where the dreams go as the winds list.
And the feet climb upon stairs of mist
Through long quiet and silver sighing.

THE FINISH OF THE OLD BUFFERS’ RAGE,


Ewes and Lambs.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ANEW day is breaking, the bush birds
are waking,
There’s a blush in the east that
announces the sun ;
There’s thumping and bumping of kangaroos
jumping,
And lanky-legged emus go by at a run;
There’s the baaing and bleating of ewes and
lambs meeting,
And the cracks of the whips of the men
in their train
Come sharper and clearer and nearer and
nearer,
And the lead of the flock opens out on
the plain.
Through low scrub they’re heading and wind-
ing and threading,
Till a ewe with twin lambs leads them
off on the wing;
Then a dog old and cunning works out where
they’re running
And wheels them again with a rush and
a swing.
There are tracks interlacing the swamp they
are facing;
But they form two divisions and each takes
a side;
The tailers are rushing and jambing and
crushing,
And the weaklings squat flat in the bushes
to hide.
There’s a yelling and boohing, whip-cracking
and shooing,
As the shepherds ride round with their
dogs in their wake ;
And the boss as he glances considers his
chances
Of reaching the yards ere the lambs make
a break.
They are ringing and curving, the old ewes
are swerving
And spread a half-circle in front of the
gate;
One goes forward, creeping and peering and
peeping,
Jumps in, and then out at a hurricane
rate.
It seems that they’ll beat us, as they race
out to meet us;
There are whistles and catcalls and hulla-
baloo
Ere wrong can be righted; the boss gets
excited
And works off his wrath on a young
jackeroo.
He yells to a rider, ‘“Good God, man, keep
wider —
Keep wider, I tell you, and let the ewes
go!’’
With no sign of slowing the lambs keep on
going,
As true and as swift as the flight of a
crow.
The ewes are retreating, bewildered and
bleating,
And our chances of yarding the' rebels are
small;
Green grass is the reason, ’tis a bounteous
season,
But when shearing comes round we will
muster them all.
The flock is now bustled and hurried and
hustled,
All hands and the cook and his slushy are
there ;
The dishcloths and bagging they’re waving
and wagging
Remind one of banners and flags at a fair.
Then right through the gateway an old ewe
goes straightway
And looks not behind till she reaches the
race,
And bounding behind her her lamb goes to
find her,
And the rest follow on at a rollicking pace.
We fill up the races, the men take their
places,
And the catchers and markers line up to
the rail;
The knife-blades are flashing and slitting and
slashing—
There’s a rosette of blood where there
once was a tail.
The pliers are clipping and punching and
snipping;
There’s a smell of carbolic and tar in the
air;
The jackeroo snatches and bungles his
catches,
And at last gives it up and jumps out in
despair.
By many feet tramping and treading and
stamping
The yard is soon puddled to soft, sticky
mud,
And, gaping in wonder, his foot makes a
blunder,
And the new jackeroo gets a drenching of
blood.

A Friend of the Family.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HER name was Maudie, and mine is
Aurora Scott. I came down to my
disordered little dressing-room one
Saturday afternoon and found her busy with
my make-up box.
Having a look round, dearie?” I said,
assuming that Maudie would put down my
properties and shiver. Not Maudie. She
turned round and said mildly: “Oh. I didn’t
ingroom sharing your dress-
?ou re what?” I snatched my posses-
sions away aggressively. “You’re ivhat?”
„ , r a l u . le ’ pmde-un like a bad German doll,
übbed her lips with a bit of number three
carmine and then picked up my hare’s foot,
t took it from her and went in to Amelia
*VttP ,° was dressing next door.
VYhats that in my dressing-room?” I
Sa !i I preceding to take off my boots.
Ask father,” replied Amelia, whose
black eyes were staring wildly out of her
wash of cold cream.
Maudie put her head round the door. “Do
I make up for a matinee? I’ve never made
up before.”
“Injustice! Injustice!” I interrupted,
talking to Amelia. “What have I done
to father that he should put this in my
dressing-room?”
Amelia shrugged her shoulders. “I
dunno, dearie. Better go and ask him.”
One boot on and the other in my hand,
I went for father, who was making up his
face on the stage and superintending the
setting of the scene at the same time. Father
was “dear old dad,” producer, stage-manager
and general actor of our stock company. We
were a very happy family, as a rule. We
had none of your stiff stage-door keepers
and things like that attached to us. We
came and went as we liked; and if father

“How do you keep the hires of your husband’s affection burning? n
“Oh, I fust hunt up an old flame now and then.”
wanted a few extras at any time he just
went out into the lane or the street in
front of the theatre, selected a group of
standers about, bought them a drink and
then cajoled them into the theatre. But we
all loved father.
“What’s that in my dressing-room?” I
inquired.
“Oh, oh yes, Miss Scott. I forgot to tell
you—a Miss Tookins —friend of the family,
I think. The boss introduced her to me—
told me to give her a job as an extra, and
do all I could for her. He said to put her
in your dressing-room for the time being, as
she mustn’t go down in the cellar with the
other supers.”
“A super in my dressing-room ! Father !
What have I come to? Am I an actress or
am I” •
“Oh, Scotty, for the love of Rignold, be
a sport! I’m not the girl’s boss. Bill,
where’s the gun for this table? Scotty,
listen ! I tell you the boss—down-stage with
that chair, Bill.”
“Where is the boss?”
“I don’t know. On holidays, I think.
Now, got your bunches ready,' Tiny? What
are you using there?”
“Father!” I shook my boot at him. “I’m
not going on till that girl’s removed.”
“Got your sofa, Bill? Here, Scotty, hang
on to those things for a moment.” Father
pushed his make-up into my hands; and that
is all the satisfaction I got from him. I
held the messy things while he helped Bill
with the sofa, then I kicked off my other
hoot to the glory of the profession ; and old
Bluewinks, who sat up on his little ladder
trying the spots, said: “Go it, Scottv! Go
it!”
“Injustice!” I repeated. “A super tacked
to me like an old man of the sea just.be-
cause I’m an understudy. Oh, this rotten
profession !” And when I went back in my
stockinged feet there was Maudie at my
greasepaints again.
It should be mentioned here that being
general rouseabout of a stock company I
was allowed the privilege of a leading lady.
I could, as you see, take off my boots on
the stage before the curtain went up, if I
liked. I could faint after a big scene or
send myself flowers. And my temperament
was respected.
“Get out,” I said to_ Maudie, hunting for
my pewter spoon, which she had mislaid.
“Oh, she’s a perfect peach—rotten !”
Then Maudie came back not at all per-
turbed.
“He said my make-up’s hellish,” she mur-
mured. “What is that? Don’t I look pretty,
like you? He told me to ask you to give
me the once-over. What is that? Would
■you give me the once-over?”
“What?” I said, hands on hips. “Make
you u"? By Holloway, you go back and
ask that man if he thinks I’m the theatre-
cleaner !”
Maudie, even meeker than Mary’s little
lamb, though she was nearly as big as a
bull, went and delivered my message to
father.
“I’m to dress with an idiot,” I said when
she returned with father’s message that she
was one of the extras in my supper scene,
and a face such as hers now was might
spoil the whole picture.
“Half-hour, ladies and gentlemen,” came
the call.
“Come here,” I snapped, “Wash your
face first. Here’s some cream. No, don’t
use soap, you imbecile ! Now, rub some of
that oil on it. Hold your hand out. A
nice job. They’ll be asking me to clean their
property silver next week !”
Maudie remained as passive as Raphael’s
angel. Made-Up, she was a beauty. She
had features born for a make-up box.' Naked-
faced she was plain, but plastered with all
our layers of stage-paraphernalia she was a
beauty.
We got the quarter-call when I was finish-
ing her eyes.
“Now, sit down and don’t smile.” She
sat down, and she did not smile.
Amelia came in and looked at her. She
got interested.
“Where’ve you come from?” she said to
Maudie. “What are you? Amateur, adven-
turess or what?”
“I’ve been married,” replied Maudie.
“Overture, beginners,” cut in father, who
was also call-boy in emergency. And Maudie,
never having rehearsed, just walked in and
walked out wherever she liked, whenever she
liked. Bill, our scene-shifter and scene-
painter, complained that she had walked
out of a window at the top flight of a six-
storey building; but father said in his peace-
ful way, “Never mind. Never mind. She’s
a friend of the family.”
I came back after the first act to find
her trying on my opera-cloak.
"May I wear it?” she asked. “I haven’t
got one for the evening scene. I didn’t
know until I was told. I”
“May you? Woman, do you want me to
shoot you?” I said shaking a property re-
volver at her.
“But may I wear it?” was all she said:
and father cut in again.
“Fix Miss Tookins up if you
can, like a sport, Scotty. I.M.P.
told me to do all I could for
her.”
“Wait until I see 1.M.P.,” 1
said, and went to Amelia.
“What am I going to do ?” I
almost wept.
“You’ll spoil your eyes if you
cry,” she replied. And, having
had a dash of soda in some-
thing, she lurched a little to-
wards me and remarked con-
fidentially, and “like a lady,”
“Give her a smack on the
mouth.”
I went back and had a look
at Maudie’s mouth. You could
not have smacked it any more
than you could have smacked a
nice baby’s. It was curved like a
Cupid’s bow; and there she
stood like a large pink-and-white
infant, coolly waiting for per-
mission to wear my opera-cloak.
I pulled her hair. I wanted that girl to
turn round and hit me—or bite me, for prefer-
ence. I really wanted to fight her, nail and
tooth and fist and claw. But she just looked at
me and said: “Oh, I wouldn’t have done that
to you, Miss Scott.” That was all.
“Second act, ladies and gentlemen,” came
father’s voice. “All right, Miss Scott? Re-
member, Miss Tookins, you have to walk
across the stage on Mr. Brown’s arm here.”
“Oh, do I?” Off she went in my new
cloak.
“It’s preposterous ! Unbearable ! I won’t
go on again.” I flung myself out of my dress
temperamentally.
r “What’s going on in number three?”
Young Monkton, who was our villain, spoke.
“I hear it is a super at large—a friend of
the family’s”
“Miss Scott! Miss Scott! Miss Scott!
Stage waiting!”
“Triumph !” I hissed. “I’ll hold the show
up,”
But I did not. I flung myself on tempestu-
ously.
“What a w-o-nderful actress you are. Miss
Scott!” said Maudie when I came off. “I
could watch you for ever.”
“You serpent!” I hissed. “If I were a
cannibal chief and you a missionary I should
chew you up, bones and all. Pull off my
leggings and make yourself useful.”
"Oh, my. heart isn’t too strong, Miss Scott.
I couldn’t.”
She couldn’t do anything for anyone but
herself at any time; and, to make matters
worse, everyone kept saying: “By Jove,
Scott, you are playing superbly this week.
It’s great to play up to you.”
Did I say our lead was ill and I was
temporarily in her place? I must be fair
to I.M.P. He did not know this when he
told father to put Maudie in my dressing-
room. Father did not know himself, as °a
matter of fact; because, when our lead got
sick she only told us at the last second. 0 I
might have been able to study her part had
I known a few hours before the curtain went
up that I had to take her place; and that
was not in the game. She came back at
the end of the week, and 1 subsided into a
rubbishy bit of a boy who just darted on
and off ridiculously. My temperament sub-
sided with the part, and I had leisure to
investigate Maudie’s case.
“Where do you live?” I asked.
“Round the corner. What nice white feet
you have!”
Father came by and put in; “Don’t forget
to dirty your feet, Aurora. You’re supposed
to be a street urchin, not a Greek statue.”
“What a pity!” said Maudie. “I like
father. You know I loved a man once.”
She clasped her hands over her knee, and
I waited; but no news of the lover.
“May I call you Aurora?” she asked.
“You may not,” I snorted. “This insult
serves me right for speaking to a super.”
“All right,” she said quietly. “May I
have the loan of your theatrical lard?”
“No. Confound you. No. Where’s vour
own? Didn’t you get paid last Friday?”
“Yes. Only fifteen shillings ; and I wanted
to buy a new hat with that.”
“While you used my hard-earned grease-
paints. You shall not have the loan of a
single other thing from me. So there!”
So she brought down a pound of ordinary
lard and a packet of self-raising flour the
next night, and was in great demand with
the men supers down in the cellar, who found
that a band of stage brigands or sailors
looked just as well in a make-up of lard
and flour, with a dash of cochineal to color
up the lips and cheeks, as in regular grease-
paints.
Then on Thursday night she said to me
wistfully: “Miss Scott, do you think I might
go out with Alex. Hayes’? I thought I’d
ask you, because I don’t know. I wouldn’t
like to do anything wrong, and I’ve always
heard the stage is such a wicked place for
a young girl. Would you go out with Alex.
Ha.ves?”
"Alex. Hayes!” I cried. I thought I was
going to marry Alex., our dashing juvenile,
at Christmas, so you may imagine how this
news smote me and how my temper—tem-
perament, I should say—improved. “Go out
with Alex.!”
“Yes. He asked me to go to the pictures
with him.”
“If you go out with that man,” I shook
her own cracked mirror at her —“if you
go out with Alex. Hayes, I’ll just quietly
murder you, Maudie. Understand?”
“All right,” she said slowly. “But I
always thought you liked father.”
“Father? Why, father has had 17 wives
and 42 children!” He had not had more
than four wives, as a matter of fact, but I
wished to impress Maudie.
She was not to be impressed. She clasped
her mild hands over her mild knees and said
again, “I loved a man once.”
But I had to have my scene with Alex.
“Oh, the poor kid!” he replied when I
pulled him and his heavily-brilliantined hair
aside in the wings, and asked him what it
meant, “I just felt sorry for her, Aurora.
You girls are giving her such a bad time.”
“Bad time! What about me? She wore
my opera-cloak.”
“Look out, dear. That’s my cue,” he said,
and left me.
“If someone doesn’t soon kill this girl or
get her out of my way, I shall go mad,” I an-
nounced.
THE THEORIST.
“I hope I haven't bored you. But it’s really
a most fascinating subject, this banking
and finance.'"
"Yes, darling. It seems perfectly wonderful
that anybody could know so much about
money as you do without having any."
Then the climax arrived. There was a
deck scene during the show, in which
Maudie and I took part. I was a middy
and Maudie was a passenger who just walked
up and down the deck. All the week she
had done her best to speak to me during
the scene ; but I had skilfully dodged her, as
it is a great breach of stage etiquette to
speak to a super before the audience. This
deck scene was not important, really. It
was very short, too. But in a moment of
forgetfulness I leaned over the deck-rail, and.
having spoken a few lines to a steward
below, I remained looking over at the people
whose scene was taking place on the lower
deck. Then Maudie came up to me.


“I only wanted to tell you what a lovely
middy you make,” she said as I turned
away. She came after me, and I saw that
she was carrying my silver bag. It made
me gasp. Everyone in the theatre knew that
silver bag, from gallery to stalls and boxes.
“You cat!” I almost cried, and then, sav-
ing my dignity, I turned abruptly again, lost
all my exit-sense in the confusion of my
anger, and walked down the first opening
I saw. I landed, to my amazement, in the
wings beside father.
“My God!” he cried when he saw me.
“Where’ve you come from?”
“Up on deck,” I said shivering with rage,
“and if that girl isn’t out of my room and
my life in the morning, I’ll never darken the
doors of this theatre again.”
“But there isn’t any exit from the upper
deck,” said father. “Aurora, you’ve come
down the funnel of the ship !”
“Oh, my God of Garricks!” I raved. But
before we knew where we were Maudie was
coming off too, leading the rest of the supers
like lambs to the slaughter. We heard a
scatter of mirth in the audience.
“Go back, you fool!” cried father. “Go
back. Stand still! Still! Stand still for
the love of Heaven ! Sit down ! Sit down ! Die,
damn you ! Sit down ! Go back ! Go back !
Stand still —still —still, you idiot!” These
admonitions only bewildered poor Maudie,
who was lost on deck without me. We never
rehearsed the supers with scenery ; and the
ship was so beautifully constructed that it
would all come to pieces at a gasp. Though
we had not known it, we on the upper deck
were built into the vessel. Poor Maudie!
Any other super would have cried. She did
not. She wandered up and down that deck
like. the hundredth sheep; and her lambs,
panic-stricken at my disappearance, wandered
mournfully after her. Then she got the
great inspiration of her life, for she was
determined to leave the ship.
“Go back ! O —o —oh, go back !” we all
cried. “Stand still!” In vain. Maudie led
her lambs sheer into the sea, pushed aside
the ocean with one fair hand, and they all
dropped down, full fathom five, one after the
other, upon the stage below. The curtain
came down quickly on the shipwreck, and
father turned and rent me. “It was your
fault, your fault, that they all walked into
the sea,” he said. “What did you want to
come down the funnel for in the first place?”
“You thank your stars I didn’t pick up
the funnel and hit that girl over the head
with it,” I wept. “To-morrow night, if she
molests me, I shall.”
But she did not, for the morrow ended
Maudie for ever.
She and a number of other supers were
rehearsing a harem dance —a sort of ballet
father was teaching them for some Eastern
disturbance we were to play—and mild-eyed
Maudie was standing on the stage receiving
instructions in camisole and bloomers. No
dainty practice costume for Maudie! She
stood calmly there in her pink-ribboned cami-
sole, and was wholly undisturbed when the
other girls nudged one another and giggled
at her costume. She did her best to execute
the simple steps; but she was about as
graceful as a grand-elephant with no idea
of time —a hopeless dancing-pupil.
Father’s patience was a miracle. Even
Maudie must have appreciated it as she fell
over her own feet north and south and east
and west.
“I think you had better stand out of the
ballet, Miss Tookins,” he was saying when
the uproar which ended Maudie began. I
was in my dressing-room and only heard the
noise. Then I felt a general scatter, and
heard screams and cries and squeals.
“What is it?” I said, putting my head
round the door.
One of the ballet-girls came in in terror.
“It’s Maudie’s husband !” she said. “Maudie’s
husband!”
“Husband! I didn’t know that she had
a husband. Yes, she did say that she had
been married when she first came.”
THE HUSBAND'S ROLE.
“What are you children up to now?”
“We’re playing mothers and fathers.”
“But where’s Bobbie?”
“I told you tee were playing mothers and
fathers, so how can you expect me to
know that?”
“Married ! What’s a married woman want
to go on the stage for at her ,age? Ough!
Listen to him. He’ll kill father !”
“Kill him?”
“Y’es. He’s a butcher !”
“Good heavens!” I cautiously crept out,
and there, sure enough, was a man in a
butcher’s blue apron threatening father.
“Lead my wife astray, would you! Look
at her! Look at her ! I’ve been wondering
what kept her out at nights. But I never
thought she left her home for this. Look at
her, naked there!”
Quite unperturbed stood Maudie. her hands
poised in the air just where her husband
had disturbed her ponderous dancing. She
was the only calm person in the scene.
“Save him! Save him!” I cried in my
richest third-act climax voice, as I saw
AT REST.
“He talks a lot about his wife's first husband. Is he jealous?”
“No. Envious.”
the burly butcher attack father. “Save
him !”
And then Maudie rose like a Siddons to
the cue.
With a sort of leave-it-to-me air, she
approached her spouse.
“Get out, Bill,” she said, turning her
butcher round by the collar. And, as calmly
as if she had been passing him a piece of
cake or his hat, she brought the flat of her
hand hard across his mouth.
We gasped.
So did he.
“Maudie!” he said in amazement.
Maudie was as unmoved as soap.
“Get!” she replied. “You’ve ruined my
career, and I hope you’re satisfied. I’ll
come home.”
“Oh, Maudie,” he began to stammer. “I
didn’t think you’d disgrace your husband
like this!”
“Get!” she repeated ominously; and he
got.
She came into the dressing-room, into
which I had melted in amazement as
she smote her husband. I was combing
out my false curls when she arrived,
and she was all of a rush. She began to put
her dress on over her camisole and bloomers
without a. word. Then she burst out sud-
denly as she began to pack up her few
things. “Here, you can have that and that
and that.”
“That” was the lard, and “that” was the
self-raising flour, and “that” was the cracked
mirror and the odds and ends of greasepaints
and stuff she had managed to buy or borrow
somewhere.
“Th—thank you,” I said timidly.
“Don’t thank me,” she snapped". “Don’t
thank me,” banging her fist down on the
dressing-table. “Don’t thank me, you
cat!”
I’ve never heard myself nor any other
cat so adequately described before. The air
was puce and scarlet and mauve and vermil-
ion and all the colors you would be likely
to see quickly in a railway smash. Then
she began to cry. I was dumbfounded.
Maudie crying!
“Making me hit me lawful husband,” she
stammered. “I’m done with yon!” She
stabbed on her hat with a hatpin. “What
a place to be in ! You’d have had me in
gaol. You —you and me—me hitting me law-
ful husband!”
And Maudie’s exit would have done Bern-
hardt credit.
“Second act. please, ladies and gentlemen,”
said father. ‘‘That’ll do to-day, girls. Now,
Scotty, when you’re ready, please! Come
along': I have to go home and do my ironing.”
ZORA CROSS.
Doloroso.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
U'—r-'HIS the street Mrs. Gray lives in?”
asked the ambulance man of the
unwashed woman in a soiled kimono
who hung over a weak-kneed fence in a
narrow, unlovely street.
“Yes,” said the woman, opening the gate.
“In here. She’s ready.”
The man turned and whistled to the driver
of the big yellow waggon that waited at
the street corner.
The car purred up to the gate. The un-
washed woman led the way to the room
where Mrs. Gray lay on a mattress on the
floor. Jimsey crouched beside her, his face
hidden: they’ had lain so for hours. Now
Jimsey had fallen asleep, while Mrs. Gray
was in a stupor induced by the merciful
“hypodermic” the doctor had given her.
“Balm of Gilead,” he had called it.
Tenderly the unwashed woman gathered
.Thnsey into her arms and stealthily, quietly,
without waking the exhausted child, took
him away next door, while the ambulance
men just as gently lifted Mrs. Gray and car-
ried her to the car. Swiftly and silently
they bore her to the House of Pain on the
brow of the hill.
Hastily, deftly, the nurses prepared her
for the ordeal, making of her a pitiful cari-
cature of lovely woman. A gown of coarse
white cotton that did not reach her knees,
long white stockings (the poor woman won-
dered if they were to keep her warm or to
hide her thin shanks) ; and, final indignity,
a hideous tight white cap or bonnet which
hid her hair, accentuating the sharp fea-
tures, sunken eyes and bluish skin.
“Quick!” the nurse said. “There goes
the doctor’s bell. They’re ready. Any false
teeth?”
“Not yet,” Mrs. Gray said, bravely
attempting to joke; “but I’ll soon be get-
ting some.”
“Sure, you’ll look fine then.”
On to the trolley they lifted her, and
wheeled her through many corridors till they
reached a small ante-room off the theatre.
Here a young doctor fixed a mask over
her nose and mouth and ordered her to
breathe deeply. She not only breathed
deeply, she breathed frantically. She had
heard of a woman who was put on the
operating-table and opened before she was
“well under.” She clutched the hand that
held the mask and muttered feebly, “Don’t
take it away yet. I’m not gone, not gone
—not gone”....
It was black, so black, and there was
a sound of rushing waters in her ears, and
she was tearing her way through space to
where Jimsey waited crying for her....
Wearily, painfully, she climbed out of the
pit of blackness, to see faces around her.
One so pitiful, so strong, so kind, she knew
was Jesus Christ. She turned blurred eyes
to the sweet-faced nun who held her hand,
and said, “That is Christ —they crucified
Him! And now they’ve crucified me.” But
....no, it was the doctor, and no sound
passed her lips; she slipped again into dark
ness, down, down, down. Would she never
reach the bottom?. .. .
Someone shrieked “Holy Mary, Mother of
God, pray for me.” Was she in Hell? All
the pain in the universe was centred in one
white-hot spot that was her, and this white
spot kept whirling and whirling, sending-
rays and sparks of hot agony to every nerve
in her body.
Merciful darkness again wrapped her.
■When next she opened her eyes it was on
Nick’s face she looked. He was grimed and
black with coal-dust, from the ship whence
be had just been summoned.
'His wife was dying in the hospital, they
had told him, and he must make haste. His
tears made streaky furrows through the
grime and dust. He looked so ugly. She
quickly closed her eyes again, while he cried
weakly and wondered what they’d do without
Janet.
He wished now he hadn’t let her work so
hard. “ ’Strewth, if only she’ll live I’ll be
decent to her. S’welp me Gawd, I will.”
He was so sorry for himself that he began
to sob loudly, and was quickly but firmly led
away by Sister Gabrielle.
“Go home,” she urged kindly; “get cleaned
up and have a meal. Come back to-night;
there may be a change then.”
Once more she climbed out of the pit of
dreadful night. The whirling white centre
of pain would not let her stay there. Some-
one was passing a wet cloth over her face
and she made a weak effort to catch it in
her mouth, to suck the moisture and so ease
the throat that was aflame.
“A drink —water, for God’s sake,” she
said fiercely. The nurse moistened her
mouth with a teaspoonful of tepid water.
The woman at the end of the ward sat
straight up in bed and in commanding tones
said again: “Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us now, and in the hour of our
death.” She fell back murmuring, “Pray,
pray, pray for us,” and then laughed
strangely. This time Janet Gray went
gladly back to the darkness.
It seemed to her that far, far away she
saw a glimmer of light, and there were two
small hands beckoning. But she felt she
would rather stay in this quiet darkness.
To struggle back to that light meant pain
—white-hot pain, and thirst, as well as the
shrieks and prayers of Holy Mary’s devotee.
Queer thoughts stabbed her even in this
dark peace. She wondered that she wasn’t
at all bothered about the rent, or boots for
Maggie. There were no washtubs; no heavy
wet clothes to lift. It didn’t even matter if
Jimsey had an egg or not. This must be
Heaven; she would certainly stay.
The light grew brighter and bigger, the
hands more insistent. Somebody wanted her.
She must go and see....
Of course it was Jimsey. Who else would
it be? His thin arms were round her neck,
his mouth close to her ear. With a strange
intensity he was murmuring over and over
again: “Mummy, you mustn't die. You’ve
got to live. I’ll make it all up to you. I
will, I will —do you hear, Mummy?”
There were no signs of tears. His eyes
were big and very bright; his face pinched
and drawn.
When his mother opened her eyes and
smiled wanly, he kissed her softly, and knew
he had conquered.
The doctor and the sister came round the
screens that were about her bed. After a
moment’s examination of Mrs. Gray, he ex-
claimed in surprised tones, “Extraordinary!
’Pon my soul, sister, she will pull through,
I do believe.”
With which remark lie proceeded to adjust
his hypodermic and administer a further dose
of “Balm of Gilead.”
WINIFRED HAMILTON.
Anemone.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE sad and faithful tide has drawn far
out
In slow pursuance of its anguished
quest;
Beyond the reef the chafing breakers shoyt,
Foam-dust blown backward from each wrath-
ful crest,
Imperious, implacable white foes of rest.
But here, in the great pool,
Rock-rimmed from turmoil, crystal-dark and
cool,
A thousand fates are silently fulfilled
As the First Impulse willed.
The brown breadths of the kelp turn lan-
guidly,
Mingle, and slide apart;
The barred bright fishes dart
Hither and thither where the delicate weeds
With purple fronds and strings of water
beads
Shadow the hues of lesser folk that be.
Crouched back from all,
Coiled in a hollow of the mantled wall,
The sharp-eyed octopus, from the sea-flowers,
Watches and watches through the tranquil
hours.
All these I see,
I the anemone, the furled anemone.
Red as live blood, pursed like the lips of
pride,
I glow on the dim ledge, and, water free,
Wait in a trance of patience the return-
ing tide,
Small, smooth and motionless, fettered,
supine;
Yet not the ship-spilled rubies that may shine
Among the rose and pearl of unknown
shells
In the pellucid depths where quiet dwells
Hold richer fire than mine.
NOT A CASE FOR ANCHOVY.
THE WAITER: “What sauce would you like
with your fish, sir?”
THE DINER: “What disinfectants have you
got?”
And evening slants across me, till at last
The pool is troubled in its sleep profound,
Dreams of an echoing sigh, the phantom
of a sound,
A tremor of awakening, swelling fast
To gurgling triumph ; the news comes yearn-
ingly
Through secret channels from the mother sea.
Now in despair and hope, singing with pain,
The tide sweeps home again.
Now the pool fills, and the green water
heaves
And writhes impassioned till the prisoning
rock
Is overflowed ; and now the giant leaves,
The kelp’s torn streamers, fight and inter-
lock
Like drowning things; at the sonorous call
The starfish and the mottled limpet crawl,
Slowly, grotesquely, their appointed way.
Now I, at the first cold kiss of the spray,
Open my treasures to the waning day.
I, the anemone, the closed anemone,
That captured tear of crimson clarity,
Tasting the bitter water, burst afresh
Into a braver beauty, and outshake
The net of my long tresses to enmesh
The sea-gifts of the ripples as they break.
I blossom like a flower of the dry earth;
Strange longings have their birth
And drive through every fairy filament
The hunger of ecstatic discontent.
These hours are mine!
Ere yet once more a moveless jewel I shine,
Left by the failing waves to thirst above,
These hours are mine!
Mine the tide-throbs that bring me life and
love
And with love life’s renewing! Joy divine
Thrills through and through my tiny entity,
Till the almighty, moon-tormented sea—
Nay, that remote, wild brilliancy of sky-
Is not more rapturous than I!
VICTORIA.

In ’Orspital.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN Phil the Showman called on me
I remarked that he seemed to have
lost weight.
“Lorst weight!” echoed Phil, “Blime, I’m
as poor as a blackfeller’s dorg. An’ no
wonder. I been a patient in one of them
there noble institootions, subsided by the
Guv’ment, a public ’orspital.”
I asked for details.
“I’ll tell you the ’ole yarn,” he said, “not
that there’s much to it.
“I ’ad a job to choke off ole Shan the Goat
from takin’ on them there darncers I was
tellin’ you about, the lars’ time I was down.
I couldn’t side-track ’im no ’ow. ’E’s as
snake-’eaded as a dooty-struck John w’en ’e
gets set on anything. Right or wrong ’e
wanted to go up to Goulburn with them
there ’arf-dressed tarts as a ’igh-clarss tent-
show of arithmetic darncers. ’Struth! ’E’s
as dilly as a sheep! Fakin’ collar-studs an’
toothpaste from door to door’d be a better
lurk for ’im! I ’ad to keep ’im well oiled at
the finish, ’cos w’en ’e’s potty ’e don’t give a
dam’ ’oo ’olds the kip, an’ a little child can
lead ’im, as the song ses. The older ole
Shan gets —’e’s on’ a ’undred or so now—
the more ’e wants to get messin’ about with
tarts an’ Toms. J’ever notice ’ow all the
old ruins is like that, allers tailin’ after
young twist-an’-twirls w’en they ought to be
gettin’ theirselves willin’ for the bone-
yard ?
“So I got a tiger-shark instead. I rec-
koned Shan’d be safer, like, with a shark.
Yairs, we bought ’im from a bloke at Cro-
nulla, an’ cot the first rattler, quick an’
lively, for Dubbo an’ Narromine. We ’ad
a good pitch in the main street, an’ the
Johns give us a open spin. We done real
well. Jus’ the tent, the shark, an’ a big
banner wot Shan painted ’isself. ’E’s a
shrewd ole cow in some things. ‘Monster of
the Deep. Giant Tiger Shark. Direck from
Coogee,’ ’e ’ad on it, an’ ’e painted a pitcher
of a shark —at leas’ ’e said it was a shark,
though it mighter been a dreadnought cigar
or a big blue banana.
“It was a soft show to spruik for. A shark
up there in the Darlin’ pea arrear’s as rare
as a Yid in the Salvation Army. We got
’arf the front laig of a dead ’orse, from the
knee down —’air, ’oof, an’ ’orseshoe, all com-
plete—an’ ’a few oyster-shells, an’ some
bones, an’ a coupler mullet, a beer bottle, a
brown boxer ’at, an’ one of Shan’s boots,
an’ we wet the lot, an’ laid ’em in a ’eap
alongside the monster of the deep. You
oughter ’card the tugs! A man didn’t need
to pitch ’em a fairy ’ow we’d got all that
there bottle-o junk outer the shark. They
noo it, without bein’ told.
“But by the time we got to Peak ’lll that
there fish didn’t need no spruiker. It was
’ot weather. ’E ponged like a trawlin’ in-
dustry. So we lumbers ’im out inter the
bush, one dark night, an’ lef’ ’im there,
’ummin’ to ’igh ’evvin, as Billy ’Ughes might
say. That was the finish, an’ we come back
well ahead of it.”
“But the hospital?” I interrupted.
“I’m coinin’ to that. At the Sydney sta-
tion we runs inter Bill Ironsides’ missus.
’Er an’ ’im travels the shows with a eddi-
cated goat named Napoleon, like Shan used
to ’ave years ago, an’ she drums us that
Bill’s in bed with the rlieumaticks. So we
blows over to Balmain to ’ave a cook at ’im.
The upshot of it was ’e loans us Napoleon
to go up to the Gympie show with, on a
percentage, pervided I give me word I’d
keep Shan off the soup. They noo Shan
could ’andle the goat orright if ’e could be
kep’ sober.
“So we lugs the tent an’ the goat straight
through to Gympie, an’ Shan paints a noo
banner about N a Poleon bein’ the mather-
matikle marvel. Everything was all sir-
garney. We ’ad one accerdent at Gympie,
AN UNFORTUNATE BID.

at the pub one mornin’ an’ butts the Chow

goin’ to let all the eddication outer

“ What’s happened to that jolly friend of yours who used to tell all those funny stories?”
“Oh, he will never do that again.”
“Why! Is he dead?”
“No, married.”
’e was wearin’ for luck, an ’that made ’im
do ’is block. Them Pats is terrible super-
stishus.
“After Gympie we went further north, an’
there I gets terrible crook. Clergyman’s
throat an’ pains in the darby. I did ’arf-a-
jim on a quack, an’ ’e orders me inter ’orspi-
tal. So I sent Shan back to Balmain with
Napoleon—Shan was a ‘returned empty,’ as
you might say, an’ as sober as the boob.
“Well, I goes roun’ to the meatworks,
feelin’ like I was goin’ to snuff, an’ ‘Abide
with Me’ ringin’ in me ’ead. But that
Districk ’Orspital was enough to make you
bust out laughin’, some w’ays. It was a
cold mornin’, an’ rainin’ ’ard, w’en I breasts
the barrier —an’, min’ yer, it can be cold in
Queenslan’, too, though you mightn’t think
it. They kep’ me sittin’ in the vestibool —
it was as draughty as a ship’s riggin’—
more’n a hour by the clock on the wall, an’
I’m feelin’ pretty onkus, shiverin’ there, an’
sniffin’ the carbolicky pong of the place till
the main squeeze is ready to ’ave a screw
at me. ’E puts ’is telephone to me wish-
bone, an’ listens to the music like I was a
’Arry Eauder record, an’ ’e put the acid on
me a bit, an’ jobbed me a coupler times in
the solar plexus, an’ then ’e reckons I’ll
’ave to be operated on. ,’E ses I got illus-
trated sore throat an’ ulsters in me inside,
an’ ’e’ll ’ave to cut out me song-an’-darnce,
or somethin’.
“So ’e rings a bell an’ a red-headed Bol-
shie come in—a ‘orderly,’ they call ’im —1
don’t. ’E was shovin’ along a kinder
rockin’-chair on w’eels. ’E ’ands me inter
the motor, as if I couldn’t walk, an’ the doc-
tor ses, ‘Take ’im an’ give ’im a barth,’ ’e
ses, an’ min’ yer, I’d ’ad a bange at the pub
on’y a hour or so before. So me ginger
shofoor runs me down one passage, an’ up
another, an’ along a gangway, an’ then
through a open-air alley-way where the
wind cut like a stockw’ip, for min’ yer, I’m
on’y ’arf dressed.
“The barthroom was the end of a veran-
dah nartitishoned off; an’ was as airy as a
open-work stockin’. Ginger ses, ‘Take off
the rest of yer clobber, an’ I’ll go an’ see
if there’s any ’ot water.’ So I peels off, an’
after a w’ile Ginger waltzes back with a
kleiner can in ’is ’and, ’oldin’ about .’arf-a-
pint of loo’-warm
water. ‘I thought it
was a barth I was
to ’ave, not a shave,’
I sez. ‘Well,’ ’e ses,
‘your luck’s rotten,
for this is all the
water I could pinch.
’E ses, ‘Jus’ wet yer
’ands an’ chiv, w’ile
I take yer clobber
away, an’ see w’ere
they’re goin’ to give
yer a dab,’ ’e ses, an’
’e ’lef’ me as bare as
a billiard ball, with
not so much as a
bootlace, an’ as cold
as Iviandra. I could
see through the cracks
in the partishun a lot
of young sliielas in
nurses’ caps an’ w’ite
aprons, an’ I was a
bit gallied they’d come
marchin’ in on me,
an’ me a dead ring
for one of these ’ere
kewpies. I ’as me
teacup of a barth, an’
drys meself, an’ I be-
gins to wonder ’ow
lons Ginger was goin’ to be. I waited, an’
I waited, an’ I waited. But ’e never come
back, an’ I’m turned as blue as Shan’s shark
on the banner, an’ me ivories is rattlin’ like
tats in the neter at a ’azard school.
“Still no Ginger. I on’y ’ad a wet towel
on, an’ after ’arf-a-hour’s wait I ’as a scre’w
roun’ the partishun, an’ give the S.O.S. to
a tab ’oo was goin’ past. She come blowin’
in. ‘ ’Struth, miss,’ I ’oilers, ‘keep outer
'ere ! I’m Adam !’ I ses. ‘Nonsense V she
ses, an’ breasts in as unconcerned as if I
was a pillar-box—l muster gone as red as
one, anyhow. I chats ’er about Ginger, an’
she goes off to snare ’im. ’E blows back
in a ’urry. ‘Be cripes,’ ’e ses, ‘I forgot all
about yer!’ He rushes out again, an’ comes
chargin’ back with a blue blanket. ‘ ’Ere,’ ’e
ses, ‘wrap yerself in this,’ an’ ’e bungs- me
inter the motor-car again.
“ ’E was jus’ wheelin’ me off w’en a young
tart come surgin’ in—another one this time
I jerried there was trouble cornin’, for she
looked like Lazy Isabel in ole Coogan an’
West’s ‘East Lynne,’ with fire in ’er eye.
‘I cot yer this time,’ she roars, makin’ a
grab at me blanket. I clung to it like a
black gin does to ’ers, but she took no ’eed
to me. She made another ’ook at me blanket-
She feinted with ’er lef’, an’ crossed with
’er- right, an’ Ginger fought ’ard
to perfect me. It seems the
blanket ’e’d brought me ’e’d
shook from Lazy Isabel’s ward,
an’ I was goin’ to another one
altogether, an’ the young tart
was on’y fightin’ for ’er own.
‘lt’s the fifth you’ve stole this
week,’ she screamed to Ginger,
‘an’ I never get ’em back !’ An’
at it they went, ding-dong,
’ammer an’ tongs. It was as
willin’ ago as ever I see. But
after the third round I could
see Ginger was winnin’ on
p’ints so I lets out a ‘ ’Ooray V
This, give ’im ’eart, for ’e give
’er a push that sent ’er spinnin’,
an’ taking advantage of the
confusion, lie rushes me motor
off at full speed to Ward No. 3,
w’ere I was booked. Lazy
Isabel chased us right up to the
door of the ward, an’ called
Ginger all the names in the
direcktory—an’ a few more.
Any’ow, the nurse soon ’ad me
warm in dab an’ able to feel
me toes again.
“Nex’ mornin’ at 8 o’clock, the usual time
for executions, they operated on me. It
took ’em about three hours to get me ready.
‘Struth, there was as big a preparation as
the cup-winner gets! It was sickenin’.
Ginger ’e shaves me down to the Plimsoll
mark. An’ they puts w’ite stockin’s on me,
Gawd knows w’y ! An’ they wouldn’t give
me even a mouthful of water. Ginger ’e
w’eels me off to the abbatwors, on’y they
calls it a theatre, bless your ’eart! An’
there’s a coupler crokuses dressed up in w’ite
surpluses an! masks an’ rubber gloves, an’
lookin’ like a Druids’ procession without the
billygoat w’iskers. I ’ops on to the butcher’s
block —an’ that’s the lot! I could ’ear a
train roarin’ through a tunnel, an’ see the
sparks flyin’, an’ ’ear the firebell ringin’, an’
then I took the count for ten. W’en I come
to it was afternoon, an’ I’m back in bed
in Ward 3.”
“And how did they treat you?” I
queried.
“ ’Ow did they treat me, ses you? They
treated me as if I’d been Squizzy Taylor
or the Prince of Wales. Them nurses was
dinkum angels from ’Eaven, dressed in blue
print, with w’ite caps for ’aloes, an’ chemical
threemometers instead of ’arps! It’s a
bonzer feelin’, mind yer, to ’ave a bright-
eyed, saucy, clean, ’olesome-lookin’ bundle
of imperdence come along an’ jab a three-
mometer inter yer mouth every ’arf-a-hour
w’ile she smiles at yer as sweet as golden
syrup, an’ feels yer pulse with ’er little
w’ite fingers, an’ kids to make notes of yer
tempertoor in a little toy book. If they’d
on’y a fed a bloke I’d been as ’appy as a
oyster at ’igh tide.
“The tucker! ’Ere, a ’ungry dorg couldn’t
a come at it. The babbler up there —the
cook, y’know—was a Pommy, an ’e’d been
brought out from Shoreditch or somew’eres
to go on the land—pity they didn’t ’andcuff
’im to it. Dolan’s pub in the Wimmera could
cook better’ll ’im. F’rinstance, bread-an -
milk’s not a ’ard ongtree to prepare, you’d
think. Well, the Pommy way is to make
it without milk an’ serve it as cold as a
corpse. A nurse comes along when the first
cock’s crowin’ at four in the mornin’ an’
’alf-Nelson’s yer by the scruff of the neck
an’ washes yer all over, an’ then you’ve
gutter dwell for two solid hours on’y to get
imported bread-an’-milk outer the refrigera-
tor. Jus’ think of it! Ice-cream for break-
fas’, an’ nothin’ else. An’ the same for
dinner, an’ supper, too! That’s what the
Pommy poisoner did for me, an’ if them
nurses ’adn’t been angels as I say, an’ risked
their jobs to give me a sup of real ’ot Aus-
tralian corfee now an’ then, I’d a chucked a
seven.
“After a w’ile the crokus ses, ‘l’ll
put you on tripe now,’ ’e ses. I lay all
mornin’ dreamin’ of tripe an’ onions. An’
then, at 12 o’clock, along comes me Pommy
bread-an’-milk, chilled to 10 degrees below
zero, as usual. ‘Change of diet to take effec-k
to-morrer,’ ses me guardian angel. I en-
dured the 24-hours, buildin’ meself up with
the thoughts of tripe. At larst it come. It
was 2 inches long by 1| inches wide, an’
instead of tripe it was a slice shaved off
the barth sponge, an’ colder than the bread-
an’-milk. Then I got put on fish—frozen
fish, an’ cooked in a way’d make a Dago
ashamed.”
“How about the doctors?” I asked.
“Oh, you get enough of doctors, orright,”
said Phil; “I didn’t mind that so much
excep’ w’en my bloke’d bring a few friends
with ’im an’ talk to ’em about me epigram,
an’ me anno domini, an’ me el dorado, an’
things like that, an’ pay no more attensfiun
to me feelin’s on the subjec’ than if I was
a corpse. Them bedside post-mortems useter
make me feel like a freak in one of me own
side-shows.
“We ’ad a jollo now an’ again. I chatted
yer about bein’ slooshed down at four every
mornin’? Well, there’s a big Dago cane-
cutter in the bed opposite me. The first
mornin’ ’e was there along comes the nurse
before daylight, grabs ’im by the Adam’s-
apple an’ washes ’im down, all over ’im. He
didn’t seem to like it, but all ’e ses is, ‘Too
much-a, too much-a!’ for a bit. After she’d
shampooed ’im, an’ sandpapered ’im, an’
dried ’im, an’ rubbed ’is back with mether-
lated spirits, she tucked ’im in, an’ moves
off on ’er rounds. Ten minutes later a noo
nurse, just learnin’ the trade —a probasiner,
they calls ’em- —comes mincin’ along full of
dooty an’ enthoosism. She’d got all her
instruments of torture for the mornin’ wash.
She spots the big Dago, an’ not knowin’
’e’s already been operated on, she picks ’im
as a likely mark. She off with the bedclose
an’ seized ’im by the ’air of ’is ’ead in one
’and, w’ile she starts splashin’ an’ moppin’
’im with the other. All of the blokes in the
ward was deeply interested, but the Dago
was the most interested man in Queenslan’.
’E’d been too crook to move five minutes be-
fore, but that there irrigation scheme cured
’im in one. ’E gave a shriek like a saw-
mill w’istle, an’ sent the pore tart flyin’ for
shelter, an’ ’e bounded outer dab like a actor-
bat with the Willies. ’E garropled the basin
of water an’ flung it at the roof. ’E upset
the bed, an’ kicked the stuffin’ outer ’is bed-
side-locker. Then ’e gave a yell like a I-talian
opera gone ratty, an’ a ’owl of ‘Madre de
HARVEST TIME.
“Jove! Isn’t the last dance of the season fun! You’re
the fifth girl I’ve proposed to.”
“Go on! And you’re the sixth hoy I’ve accepted!”
Dio —too much-a, too much-a!’ An’ ’e
jumps through the winder, an’ the larst I
see of ’im ’e was puttin’ up a record over
the flower-beds with Ginger, Lazy Isabel an’
a brace of angels in ’ot pursoot. I ’ad the
idear ’e was lookin’ for the Pommy cook —
I ’ope ’e cot ’im!
“Well, they let me loose after I’d been
in the ’orspital about five weeks, an’ the
sawbones ’e shook ’ands, an’ them nurses all
seemed dinkum sorry I was doin’ a break.
It was like leavin’ ’ome an’ mother. The
bloke in the office on’y charged me a quid
a week, but I dooked ’im a few bob over
for the Red Cross box. An’ the first thing
I done w’en I got to Brisbane was to buy
a little bracelet watch —ridge, it was, an’
no brum —an’ I posted it back to the nurse
’oo’d looked after me. It ’ad a secon’-’and
to it, so’s she could read the nex’ bloke’s
pulses orright. She writ me a stiff to the
G.P.0., tellin’ me I was a toff an’ all that,
an’ wishin’ me the best of luck, an’ givin’ me
good advice, too, like a man’s sister might.
An’ instead of ’avin’ a row. of crosses at
the end, it said in the stiff, ‘God bless
you.’ ”
Phil blew his nose with unnecessary em-
phasis, and continued. “I useter gig at
tarts writin’ to blokes, but, dinkum. I was
near wingein’ over that there nurse’s letter.
Some’ow, it made me feel a bit small —I
dunno ’ow. A man’s on’y a mug, ain’t ’e,
w’en you come to acid ’im? But, by the
same rule, it takes a very shrewd bloke to
know ’e ain’t.”
Phil paused and gave a patently-forced
cough.
“I beleeve me dam’ throat’s goin’ crook
on me. again,” he said. “I’ll ’ave to get a
wriggle on an’ see to it. So long!” And
Phil the Showman shook hands hastily and
hurried away.

Hymn at Evening.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SEE now the shadows muster in dense
array,
Slow-gathering, and the sun is sinking
low.
So dies my life in me, look where I may,
And bids me follow where the shadows
grow.
All fevers past, and all the heats of day,
I am content. While now within me stir
I'lie dreams to which these shadows minister,
With a long yearning for my rest I sing,
Come, Evening!
To seal all memories of foregone dehiglit,
To cleanse me from all stain that get may
cling,
Come soon, dear Night!
Yet, ere I pass into the silent land
Where long-stilled voices shall cry out my
name
And I shall walk with loved ones hand-in
hand
Beyond that setting dear familiar flame
Into a clearer light,
Fain would I worship till these lips be cold
to every beckoning of mortal sense,
Worship, Beloved, your munificence
Of joy so lavishly spent in my delight;
Your tender feet that step by step with me,
Indifferent to the cruelty of the way,
bhe clogging shame of clay,
These difficult paths of vain attempt have
trod:
Y our lips that kissed me gently and consoled
My heart that almost broke from hunger of
God
And my vain impotency !
hen I, sore-wounded, wept, your healing
tears
Drew forth the stinging venom and did
assuage
My terrors, spur my courage, still my fears.
I rom youth to age
1 never in sore need turned once to you,
YY hen spent with longing, smarting from
defeat,
And found you other than staunch and brave
and true,
t Oh. sweet, my sweet!
By faint hope tortured, by dear trust be-
trayed,
Mocked by false dreams, beset by sinister
eyes,
Always you came with succor, unafraid,
O strong and wise!
When loneliness lay on my heart like lead,
And every imp of shame snarled forth to
flout me,
t*ft have I looked for death, and found in-
stead
Fife beautiful and your dear arms about
me,
And, wondering, wept upon vour breast to
see
That tears made pure by your pure thought
could be
An ecstasy.
Now sets the sun, and the grave shadows
creep
In great battalions slow to hem me in,
And from their midst one bids me think on
sleep
And boast no more of frolic and of sin.
But still you stand to help me as of yore ;
Through you I win
THE OLD. OLD SIGN.
"I feel sure Billy’s going to propose soon.”
"What makes yon think so?”
"He hates mother more every time he sees
her.”
A 0 a . u,oS t perfect hope unguessed before,
I'lie high, dear liope that on the distent shore
Where Love shall gather me close and
dreams come true,
Lll find myself still hand-in-hand with you.
tour goodness cannot pass or fade away’
Let come what may,
Nor any lover of love to Hell be hurled.
Since love’s great lover is through you for
us
The surety of joys innumerous,
< > women of the - world !
< > women of the world, I weep for shame
That I, by you befriended, still have been
So little your friend.
A helpless babe I loved you, when you Came
To smile upon my cradle. I have seen
The truth in you heroic, without end
The tale of simple faith that is your glory,
An oft-told story,
The ocean of your kindness poured for us
In welling tribute of your anguished blood,
O merciful and good,
0 miracle generous!
0 women of the world, may I, even I,
Shriven of the shame of ill ways I have
trod
(Even though thereafter straight my soul
must die),
May I be given my right and place to cry
Your praises meet at the vast knees of
God !

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.
“How fondly on such a night as this one’s mind dwells on lovely things!”
“My oath ! Wouldn’t a crag supper go well!”
I SUPPOSE you will say it was no busi-
ness of mine. A solicitor does not
usually run all over the country after
a client who persists in neglecting his own
interests ; but away up north we do strange
things sometimes, and in this case there
was my feeling of friendship for Ferguson—
that, and curiosity.
It was a matter of several hundred pounds
altogether—an unexpected inheritance from
a relative who had died intestate in New
South Wales. As matters stood, Ferguson"
could get the money by going to Sydney,
not otherwise. Never mind the details. You
wouldn’t understand them; and the Law,
which is an ass, expects fees when it brays.
I had written to him several times, and
the one or two answers I got were of the
vaguest kind, though expressive of great
preoccupation, "unfortunately rendering a
journey of any kind impossible for the pre-
sent.” When he used this phrase in two
successive letters it began to look too pre-
meditated. You’d have thought he was on
the Stock Exchange, when, as a matter of
fact, he merely ran some nondescript sort
of beachcombing outfit in an out-of-the-way
corner of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Just
what it was nobody seemed to know, and
when a man buries himself in a place like
that, nobody cares. The mails he got, two
or three a year, depended on which way the
wind blew and how the tide was running.
These were his only opportunities for getting
stores, too. I learnt this when I was seized
with the whim to pay him a visit. The
idea occurred to me in the course of a yarn
on the jetty with the skipper of a schooner
that was loading cargo for the Gulf. When
I broached the subject, he agreed to take
me with him that trip.
I gathered very little information on the
voyage. Ferguson, after all, was only one
of many men who go bush one way or an-
other. When I questioned the skipper, he
merely wrinkled up his genial eyes and said
something about never bothering to take
soundings in deep water. He probably dis-
trusted me, knowing I was a lawyer. In
any ease, these rovers of the tropic seas,
unlike your mere long-shoreman, get into the
habit of taking things for granted and say-
ing nothing. We ran along the coast to the
head of the Gulf with fair weather all the
way. Two more days, and we swept into
a smooth bay, protected and caressed by a
curved arm of land —a flat-topped sandstone
bluff, which, dipping down to a hollow that
separated it from the continuous cliffs of
the mainland, gave way here to a pretty
patch of white beach. In this hollow the
plumes of a cluster of cocoanut-palms brushed
the roof of a bungalow, sole sign of habi-
tation. Down the steep sand a figure
moved towards the water’s edge. It was
Ferguson. He rowed out to us in a dinghy
and clambered aboard.
If he was surprised to see me, I was uo
less astonished at his appearance. lie was
oddly dressed, to be sure. So far, that is, as he
was dressed at all; for he wore nothing but a
pair of knickers of grey flannel, obviously
of his own tailoring, and a broad decker hat
of thatched fibre, likewise home-made, and his
body and legs and feet were the color of a
Chinaman’s. But it was the change in his
features that—-well —shocked me. He was
much thinner than when I last saw him
three years before. He then had plenty
df flesh on his big bones, and a good-humored
gleam in liis eyes—well-defined, honest grey
eyes; and whenever he came to see me, as
he did always when he was in from the
back country, he had that unmistakable,
Hash sort of tidiness of the stockman in holi-
day _ clothes, and was shaved to a polish,
looking for all the world like a cake of
cheap scented soap. He had originally held
a position in a Sydney office, but lost it
through Iris habitual dilatoriness. Then he
came north.
So I couldn’t help staring at him. I
looked at the glazy flatness of his watery
eyes, the painful lines that pinched both
sides of his nose and dragged down the cor-
ners of his mouth, which the thin hair of
a scraggy moustache and beard could not
hide; the cadaverous pallor that yellowed
his sunburnt cheeks. It was not so much
that he looked ill, but his features were made
mysteriously repulsive by a lurking sensual-
ity—not the full-blooded sort, nor yet the
impotent leer of an effete rake, but the sug-
gestion of some pale, glaucous indulgence,
the debility of some unreal lust, fleshlessj
aqueous, virescent. . . .Oh, words! You
know that opaque feeling you get when you
visit an aquarium. You see, through panes
of glass like windows under the sea, the
tenuous glidings and sinuosities of fish-
things, and feel vaguely that you are prying,
almost indecently, into a world of silent sen-
sations whose bloodless yet lascivious
rhythms you can never understand. I felt
something like that as I stared at Fergu-
son’s face —especially the eyes, upon which
floated a detached spawn of dreams.
When we got ashore I found that his place
was comfortable enough. The bungalow was
not much more than a square verandah.
Perched up on piles of cypress-pine, it re-
sembled a wide bandstand or roofed platform,
with the difference that it was partitioned
into two or three compartments, serving as
rooms. It was well shaded by the cliff, yet
got the benefit of the north-west and south-
east winds. I was to be quartered with him
for four days. The schooner went right down
to the Wellesleys, and would pick me up on
the way back. Not knowing how he stood
for supplies, I had taken the precaution of
bringing a case of stores with me. It was
just as well. Ferguson, I found, subsisted
chiefly on rice, fish and turtle eggs, some
of which last, as we walked up the beach, lie
scratched out of a nest in the coarse, shelly
sand. The possibility of his condition being
caused by drink vanished when he offered
me some cocoanut-toddy from a demi-
john that hung in the shade of the verandah.
It was nothing more than the fermented juice
of the nuts —sour, faintly burning stuff, the
taste of which nearly made me sick.
What was it, then? I asked myself the
question as I unrolled the rug in which I
had brought my folding camp-stretcher. There
was never a sign of a black woman about the
place either, and the only indications of
trading were some weathered strewings ol
split nuts and a pile of remnant trochus and
pearl-shell, picked over, evidently, long ago.
Towards evening, when we Avere sitting at
the meal-table, I touched on the object of
my visit.
“It’s nor a difficult matter. I sent them
your PoAver of Attorney, and they won’thave
it that way either. But you have only to
go down, satisfy them of your identity, sign
the papers, and the money is yours. Don’t
you want it? You used not to be so inde-

He was pecking at some rice out of a
bowl made of half a cocoanut-shell, and
smiled wearily Avithout looking up.
“Ho I. look rich?” he said—“though I man-
age to live all right,” He Avas unconscious
of any irony in his words. “No, I can’t go
down. I can’t very rvell leave things here,
and” The sentence trailed off into the
air as he caught my eye. “Besides,” he went
on in a flat tone, after a pause, “mv health’s
not good. I couldn’t stand a journey ot
any sort.”
“On the contrary, Ferguson,” I hastened
to put in, “it’s just Avhat you Avant. If
you’re feeling off color a trip south would fix
.vou up. Better come back with me and
catch the next steamer down.”
I felt really sorry for him. He shook his
head slowly in the resigned manner of an
old man. There seemed nothing more to be
said. He twisted round on his chair, with
one arm over the back of it. and stared out
over the shadowy distance of the sea—far
beyond the further point of the crescent bay.

finite violet dusk—for what? 1 wondered.
“Why don’t you get medicine, then —treat-
ment of some sort?” I asked at last. Some-
thing prevented me from asking exactly what
was the matter with him.
He shifted uneasily, turning to me again
with his face now in shadow. He just sat
there quite still for a moment. It was un-
canny. A light breeze set the palm fronds
swishing softiy across the edge of the roof.
■‘lt’s just that —that’s what” —he hesitated
as if from weakness—‘'what I’m waiting for,”
he said. ‘‘The pain”—he passed his hands
down the front of his body shudderingly—
"especially at night!” The room was by
this time pitch dark. He went off to bed.
I cagne to the conclusion that he was
a bit mad, probably as the result of seclu-
sion. Sonieypf those who seek it succumb
to it. Next hiorning he went away early,
muttering something about having work to
do. When I offered to accompany him he
put me off with a remark about the heat
of the sun affecting those who were not used
to it. Later on, scrambling over the
cliffs, I saw him perched up in a big ban-
yan-tree quite near the house. He was sup-
porting himself against a branch with one
hand, while with the other he shaded his
eyes, gazing out expectantly across the sea.
I at once turned back unnoticed, not wish-
ing him to think I was spying. Each dav
he went off in this way. Any doubts I
might have had about his work being a pre-
tence were set at rest when, on the second
day, I almost stumbled over him as he lay
asleep in a shady nook about a mile away.
Yet these days were a novel experience
for me, and they went by pleasantly. The
spot Ferguson had chosen for his dwelling
was apparently the' site of an old Malay
camp, for an anchorage was marked with
bamboo poles, and just beside the bungalow,
beneath a great tamarind-tree that threw
a thick shade black as a blot of ink, there
was a number of old stone fireplaces, such
as are used for boiling trepang. This was
my favorite haunt, and I would lie there
lazily in the afternoons, half-asleep, building
up the lonely history of the spot —proas,
saronged figures, firelight, the steamy smell
like rotting seaweed and the spell of cadences
from lips gleaming with oozings of
betel-nut. I am not romantic, but all this
seemed to be there, in that splendid shadow,
on those old stones, just as if they had
been carved and set at the head of the graves
of the men who had left them. In this
mood, born of the drowsiness of a siesta,
I heard, on the afternoon of the third day,
a sound of voices across the water. Look-
ing up, I saw' a boat making for the beach
below'. At first I thought it was the linger-
ing of a dream upon awaking, for this craft
was full of dark-skinned figures and lma
a curved wing-lilce sail. This was so differ-
ent from the improvised sheets which are
sometimes hauled up in the dugouts of black-
fellows along the coast that I did not fully
realise them to be aborigines until I rose
and went down the beach toward them. Fer-
guson was there before me. Where he came
from I don’t know'. I had not seen him for
hours. He rushed down to the water, wad-
ing to the canoe. There was some rapid
jabbering, and then Ferguson came up,
hurrying feverishly, with a cigar-box under
his arm. He passed me without a word or
a glance, disappeared up the steps to the
bungalow', hurrying down again almost im-
mediately with a handful of nigger twist,
a row of black hands reached out for the
THEY HUNT IN PAIRS NOW.
“They tell me you had a new arrival at your
house last night."
“Yes, and he’s brought a cobber along to sec
that he gets a fair spin.”
tobacco, Ferguson returned, and the canoe
lurched off round the headland out of
sight.
Ferguson passed me as before, but this
time I turned and followed him in. He
seemed not to notice me. He put the box
on the table, impatiently prised the lid off
in pieces, then, with trembling fingers bur-
rowing among some straw packing, took out
a couple of small tins. I began to under-
stand.

Suddenly he became conscious that I was
watching him.
“I can’t wait,” he said hoarsely. “It’s ter-
rible.” He almost pushed me aside. I fol-
lowed him, nevertheless. There, sure enough,
alongside his bunk, was a tray with all the
usual paraphernalia of the opium-smoker.
When he had lit the little spirit-lamp he
eagerly opened one of the tins. I tried to
restrain him by laying a hand on his arm.
He shook it off.
“I can’t wait,” he almost whined. He
was like a maniac.
I stood by and watched him. Sitting on
the side of his bunk, he dipped a small rod
like a knitting-needle into the viscid brown
stuff, twirling it round and round above
the flame as you twirl treacle on a spoon to
prevent it from dripping. With the other
hand he took up the pipe, rolled the little
knob of hot opium on the smooth top of
its almost solid bowl, then rammed the
opium into its tiny aperture. When he took the
rod out the opium came away with it, so,
with an impatient oath, he placed it over
the flame again and repeated the whole pro-
cess. This time the opium stuck in the
pipe. He sighed and lay back with the
stem in his mouth, sucking, sucking at it
with an odious liquid sound, and with long
inhalations that hollowed his cheeks and
convulsed his lungs and shuddered down to
his abdomen, clutching the stem with the
primal greediness of a child holding a feed-
ing-bottle, till at last he relaxed, and his
arm stretched out rigid and automatic to
the tray beside him. His fingers dropped
the pipe stiffly and rested beside it like a
claw. He lay back quite still, but breathing
heavily, his features composed as if in the
blank soullessness of death. A deep, piti-
ful, nauseous disgust overcame me. In one
impulse I took the tray, with the two tins
of opium and its evil implements, and
pitched them from the top of the adjoining
cliff into deep water.
This, of course, was the worst thing I
could have done. I shall never forget the
day that followed. I recognised then the
tragic apprehension that chained him to this
lonely place—the fear that, if he left it, he
would be deprived of the means of indulging
this horrible habit, contracted God knows
how or where. He became frantic when
he learnt what I had done. Once he
flew at me in a snarling animal rage, and
I would probably have fared badly had he
not been so pitifully weak. I merely stepped
aside and he fell. Then I helped him up,
tried to soothe him, explained that, though
I had acted impulsively, I had done so with
no other motive than his own well-being. It
was no use. I myself was just about worn
out with the racket when, in the early after-
noon, a sail showed up. It was the schooner
coming back.
I had led Ferguson to his bunk at the
finish. He had been too exhausted to offer
any resistance except mumbled protests,
mingled with imprecations. I forced him
to sit on his bunk. He made an effort to
stand up again, but I pushed him back, and
he lay there quietly. When the schooner
was almost within hail I went in softly to
see how he was. I came out, and —it is
THE WEAKER SEX.

please.”
“Yes, sir; what size?”
“Er—er—small size — l’m not very tall.”
strange how one does these things—instinc-
tively pulled the hessian curtain across the
door after me.
I told the skipper all about it in a few
words. He nodded.
“It’s like that sometimes,” he said ; “dan-
gerous to stop it all at once, and it must
have been close up before you came.” He
looked up toward the bungalow. “I suppose
there’s a spade or shovel of some sort up
there?”
“Sure to be,” I said.
“Better have a couple, though—and an-
other nigger, too.” He turned to the black
boy who had rowed him ashore. “You go
back along ship, bring back Bobbie. Tell
him bring shovel.” He made an explanatory
digging motion. “Shovel. Dig-em hole in
ground. Savee?”
FREDERICK T. MACARTNEY.
Deported Once,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AT least I wasn’t exactly deported. I
\yas in the position of the gentleman
in “A Tale of Two Cities” who wasn’t
kicked downstairs; being kicked at the top
of the stairs, lie fell down voluntarily, as he
was going, anyhow.
It. was in times of peace and holy calm
that I drifted into Bombay, and inspected
it at leisure. Then somebody told me of
ANXIOUS TO PLEASE.
“’E’s goin’ dead crook at us playin' ‘Christians, Awake ’ — let’s try ’im with ‘Jerusalem,
the Golden.’ ”
Quetta, in Baluchistan, as a quaint and de-
sirable place to take in on my way north,
and being taken in I took it in. I had an
idea that it had a mild early-spring climate
like Bombay, and only revised my views on
a morning when I got out at a wayside
station for exercise and almost disappeared
in the snow. On the platiform Private
Mahomet, muffled to the eyes and armed
to the teeth, paced his frozen beat, or idly
knocked icicles a yard long off a fountain
with his rifle. I almost wept to think that,
away back in sunny Rajputana, not so
many hours before, the monkeys, clothed in
nothing but gladness and a trifle of airy
persiflage, had sat on the fence watching
the locomotive go by, and waved their tails
to me in greeting, turning round for the
purpose. One lady monkey even waved her
baby. My train struggled on up the passes
after this digression, with its snow-plough
in front and a stream of icy whiteness fly-
ing past the carriages on each side, and be-
fore noon it sighted a bleak, black, blotted-
looking place on a plain.
I forget whether the white man’s hotel
was closed or non-existent; anyhow, I was
consigned to a dak bungalow. I was the
solitary traveller. Two natives, Ram Dass
and Ram Omelette, who said in English that
they didn’t speak English, seemed astonished
as well as grieved to see me. After ft
tip they improved, but not so much as
they might have done. I afterwards learned
that the mountain tip was higher than
the lowland or plain tip, and I had not
been sufficiently lavish. The winter,,, tip*
too, was an advance on the summer tip,
for the hibernating heathen hated to be
roused.
The dak bungalow was of no specific order
of architecture. It was furnished with a
few articles of minor importance in addition
to the pair of natives. I got a fire and,
amid an atmosphere of veiled hostility, a
bath with a little of the chill off. News of
my arrival had already spread, and the har-
binger of misfortune arrived before I was
half dry. He was of medium hue, very neat
in his uniform, very important, and he looked
to me as if his name might be Kasha Rao
Holkar as easily as anything else.
This official vision took down my name
with difficulty over the spelling. He refused
to understand what a journalist was, and,
standing in a partially clothed condition be-
fore the grate, I may have lacked something
of my usual conciliatory spirit. He didn’t
know where Australia was, and almost
seemed to imply that there was no such
place. In reply to his question as to the
ownership of Australia I said it was British
when I left, and was so still unless a revo-
lution had broken out in the interim—a thing
that might happen to any place. This caused
Jung Bahadur to ask very pointedly if I
knew, and if so how I knew, that there had
been a revolution. It also made him copy
copiously in his notebook. When I forgot
to describe myself as British and spoke of
being Scotch he wanted to know if I was
naturalised, and explanations only made him
more confused in his mind and more diffuse
with his pencil. Where we finally parted
company was the point at which lie asked
what I had come to Quetta for. I said simply
“Pleasure,” and he said simply that it was
impossible. Looking out of the window at
a stretch of snow and the blot of a town
beyond I thought he was right. He accused
me of coming to see the fortifications and
count the guns, and I said I didn’t believe
there were any, for it didn’t strike me as a
place that anybody would want to steal.
Ibrahim Khan departed clothed in dignity,
and hinting, as nearly as I could make out,
that I would hear more of the matter, what-
ever the matter might be.
In the course of a lunch which compared
unfavorably with the cooking at the Savoy
or the Ritz, I resolved that I would leave
in the morning by the alternative or north-
ern route, with the hope that it might be
better than the one I had come by, and the
conviction that it would be no worse. It
seemed to me already that Quetta could get
along without me, and that we weren’t
necessary to each other. Then i wandered
across much snow, a product of Nature
which I have always detested, and entered
the town. It started all at once after the
manner of Asiatic towns, and didn’t break
the bad news gently to the arriving traveller
by having suburbs. The prevailing color
was dark and the prevailing impression was
that it was essentially a twilight town. One
felt that a throat might be slit there for 6d.
with a cut rate for a quantity. I would have
turned back early, so great was my depres-
sion, if I hadn’t come upon Jones’s drink-
ing shop for Tommies —at least, the owner
looked like Jones —and entered with avidity.
Inside I found a large floor, a tired-seeming
billiard-table, a fire supported by a vast
accumulation of ashes, Jones
prepared to sell drinks, and two
soldiers who evidently had no
money with which to buy drink
from Jones. My arrival out of
the snow caused a sensation of
a mild sort, but the company
bore up when I paid for refresh-
ment all round.
They bore up several times
during the next hour, and re-
paid my hospitality as best they
could by telling local tales and
legends, many of them concern-
ing bodies. It could not be said
that they were good narrators,
and their vocabulary was
limited, but they were an im-
provement conversationally on
the two Rams at the dak bungu-
low. From them and Jones I
learned that my uniformed visi-
tor of the morning was not his
Excellency the Governor, but
only a sub-deputy-something at-
tached to the police, His name
was Allah Akhbar or Smith—
they were vague about this.
Still desirous to be helpful the
pair offered to take me on a
walk through some picturesque
parts, where they alleged men
did not go singly. Viewing the
parts, and the parties who
infested the parts, it didn’t
seem improbable. The
sight-seeing included the place
where the alleged body was
found; the place where the
mangled remains had been dis-
covered ; and the spot where
somebody came on the pool of blood and
the brown girl whose throat had been hacked
by a knife which came over her shoulder
in the dusk. Bocal notables were pointed
out, each several degrees more depraved
and more married and more in need of be-
ing buried than the one before. Even the
best catalogue of sin is liable to grow weari-
some, however, and that of the two Tommies
did. Still they and their probable fictions
were better than no society at all, and as the
long day showed signs of closing I threw
any remaining conventions to the winds and
invited them to dinner. They were surprised
and embarrassed and declined the dinner,
but they were willing to see me safely home
and join me in sampling Ram Dass’s choice
vintages. Curiously enough it had never
occurred to me that Ram had any vintage,
and I had viewed his establishment as a
Prohibition hotel. It cheered me up to
think that a vintage or two might beguile an
unprofitable evening. When we arrived and
the two Rams saw what my company con-
sisted of they made no effort to disgiiise
their amazement, and chattered to each other
volubly.
The fag-end of my afternoon with the
gentlemen from Jones’s . drinking shop
dragged a little. We all seemed to have
outstayed our leave or outworn our welcome.
Thev had told me about all the bodies, and
I couldn’t drop on any topics that amused
them. Looking out once at the moonlight
and the snow I thought I saw two men
hovering around. It was such an unpromis-
ing donate to hover in that I wondered if
Bismillah, the sub-deputy, had sent them
to keep an eye on the Australian revolution.
Then I got rid of my guests by the elemen-
tary process of presenting them with a bottle
and saying they doubtless had some friends
at home who were waiting for a drink.
They left, and almost immediately a dis-
turbance arose outside. Looking out I 'dis-
covered that one Tommy was sitting down
in the snow, seemingly asleep, and the
other was in some form of concussion with
the presumable minions of Allah Akhbar,
or Briggs, or whatever his name might be.
Ram Omelette hovered distractedly in the
suburbs of the disturbance, or mystery, and
waved his arms like fans.
Some time in the early stages of the night,
when the fire was just going out and the
moon was just going down, I was awakened
by the soft voice of one of the Rams. He
said the sub-deputy had made an untimely
visit in his uniform (I believe he slept in his
uniform), and was interrogating the other
Ram. Did I want to see the high official?
The idea of me wanting to see Briggs struck
me as humorous and I said so. There be-
ing no humor in these parts the remark was
doubtless lost.
The two Rams weren’t such a bad pair
of brothers, after all, and as I tipped them
liberally in the morning we parted the best
of friends. Ram Omelette carried my bag
to the station. On the way we met a man
of importance whom I at first took to be
my own Ibrahim Khan, but he proved to be
a duplicate. He asked me pointedly if I
was leaving, which, in view of the presence
of me and Ram and the bag, all heading
towards the station, was a superfluous ques-
tion, but probably he liked the sound of his
own voice. I said that I was. He replied
that it was just as well, otherwise it would
be his business to see to my departure. I
didn’t fit in with the social scheme and atmo-
sphere of the city. In fact, he doubted if I
would not be found a misfit and an anom-
aly in any part of her Majesty’s Indian
dominions, however much I might orna-
ment Australia, wherever that place might
be.
With the recent example of Messrs.
O’Kelly and O’Flanagan before me I sup-
pose I* played a very minor part in all that
followed. A really great man would have
headed straight back to the dak bungalow,
and at least attempted to defend the posi-
tion, however weak from a military stand-
point. He would have despatched one of
the Rams (provided the Ram would go)
into the town to bring out legal assistance,
which, if procurable, would doubtless have
been brown, and would probably have on
its card: “Failed entrance Calcutta Uni-
versity.’’ He would have telegraphed, if
not intercepted, to the Queen, the Viceroy,
the Privy Council and the Australian press.
Also he would have sent to Jones at the
drinking shop to see if he had a spare
Tommy or two for a garrison.
As a matter of fact I didn’t even seri-
ously insult the oppressor. The worst I
said was that I was glad they were so
quick to realise that Quetta was no fit
place for a cultured Australian gentleman.
Briggs’s duplicate tried to. explain that I
had got an erroneous and inverted view of
the situation, but I passed on. Inside the

station the white stationmaster showed no
desire to enter into conversation, so I pro-
fessed not to see him. But when the train
came in I scraped acquaintance with the
driver, knowing that his name would neces-
sarily be Macpherson, and partly for the
sake of brotherhood, also partly on a finan-
cial basis, I left- Quetta riding on the engine
in defiance of the regulations. I saw the
stationmaster. and the sub-deputy person in
uniform holding converse and looking my way,
but the concerted movement to haul me off,
which I anticipated, didn’t happen.
The last I saw of an unsatisfactory town
was Ram Omelette gazing after me with what
I took to be a look of dog-like fidelity
on his countenance. It may have been indi-
gestion. I really think the two Rams were
beginning to have a regard for me, doubt-
less because of my unusualness.
I close this simple narrative by iterating
that I can’t see anything to fuss or get
apoplectic about in being deported from
a strange country, always provided the de-
portee is allowed to take his bag away with
him. Of course, the matter would take on
a different aspect if the local tyrant tried to
stick to the bag, but I have never heard of
that being done.

Vikings.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FULL thirty rowing benches,
Gilt prows above the sea—
Oh, who are these come sailing,
Come sailing eerily?
Oh, who are these that gather
With dripping oars in tune,
Keeping, keeping all together
In the spumy winter weather,
With the sheets blowm like a feather,
All a-swing beneath the moon?
Up from the ghostly harbors,
From ports that feel no tide,
From the bays that wash no beaches,
The old, dead Sea Kings ride!
Their beards are long and yellow,
Their piercing eyes are blue.
From out their shining helmets
Spring forth the pinions two.
Along the towering bulwarks
The spectral sea-hordes swgrm—
“Off up the surging water!
Ho! Ho! The king's white daughter!
Unloose the chains and grapplings —-
Sven!
Ingild!
Gorm!
“Beat up, beat up, O breezes! ,
Wind up your mists, O sea !
We are the Yngling’s children,
Salt-spattered to the knee.
We spurned the blackened hearthside,
The plough and festive board,
Roving, roving out for plunder
Where the raging billows thunder
And the toothed rocks burst asunder
All along the Saltenfjord.
Faced fair for sweet Valhalla,
Blue sword on dinted shield,
Singing ho, for spear and arrow!
No sons of Odin yield.
“We sailed from glen and fortress
At turn of early Spring.
We heard the strange winds calling,
The wild swans trumpeting ;
We left the yokes of oxen,
To rake the distant storm.
The snarling foam was swinging;
Our long, live boats bent springing,
How white the seas at H wring!
Sven !
Ingild!
Gorm!”
Out in the haunted harbor
The wind is whipping free.
“O vikings from the ghost-years
What do you want with me?”
“We claim you by the blood-pact,
Oh, stop and listen long!
You’ll remember, you’ll remember
Windy June and white December,
Not the roof and glowing ember,
But the spear and arrow song.
You’ll spurn again the wine-horn
To shoot the hissing foam ;
You will feel the waters curling
Around you heeling home.
“In bay and mouth and harbor,
Oh, you who have the sea
A-thrill in all your heart-throbs, .
You never will be free!
Back from the past we’ll call you,
Night long, in peace or storm,
Who fought for gain and glory,
Filling the skald-sung story.
Strong ghosts of fierce forefathers;
Sven!
Ingild!
Gorm!”
Victoria.
MYRA MORRIS.
When Blue Bluff Was
Poisoned.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Merrimerotherie shed is one of
the best on the Lachlan for a
shearer. Twenty-six stands there
are; the sheep don’t sport concertina
wrinkles, the grass-seed’s never bad, and at
cut-out we generally average 3000 a man.
And the shearers always mess on their own.
The fact that we sports our own cook there
means a good deal in the way of extra com-
fort, for at other sheds where the station
has a say and the rouseabouts pig-in with
us, the scran is rough, and it don’t pay to
chip the poisoner too much either. But at
Merrimerotherie we lives like fighting-cocks,
as a rule. That is, we used to until Bob
Harvey got a pen there.
Bob’s one of the rough shearers of the
old type—one of the crowd that shore with
CAUSE AND EFFECT.
FLAT DWELLER: “I think it’s a shame they
won’t allow children in. these flats. A
few youngsters would brighten the place
up so.”
VISITOR: “ Yes , coming upstairs I noticed the
tankters are simply thick with dust.”
Wild Wright and tough battlers like Mur-
derin’ Potter, Bad Bogan and Kelly the
Rager, back in the ’nineties; and he’s never-
lost his bouncing and bullying ways. They
call him the Blue Bluff because he’s red-
headed and has bluffed his way through
everywhere. In fact, him, Brummy Brophy
and his dog- is the only three that ever
bluffed their way across old Mcßean’s run.
And because no one’s called his bluff the
rest of us is mighty sorry when we finds
out at the roll-call that he’s bespoken a
stand at Merrimerotherie.
Billy the Dodger and me has fixed up with
the other boys to have January Jackson
win the ballot and cook for us during the
shearing, and he’s in charge when Blue
Bluff lobs his bluey into the men’s hut.
January isn’t a cook you’d write home about,
but I never knew a bloke could make a
“spotted dog” like him or turn out brownie
as good. That’s why me and the Dodger-
wants him bad. But I knows there’s going
to be trouble after the first two days. We
has a sort of pudding made of rice one
night, and the Bluff looks at it in a nasty
way.
“Wot’s this stuff?” he yells, as Janu-
ary slaps a dish of it in front of him.
“Rice custard,” says January in his quiet
way.
“Rice hell!” the Bluff sings out. “Take
it to blazes out of this.” And with that he
chucks it in January’s face.
In the scrap January gets a pair of eyes,
a chewed ear and a broken nose; so, of
course, he rolls her in the morning and hits
the track for Condobolin.
Theii we has a few days with the slushy
trying to . poison us, until Singing Steve
comes along. Steve’s a good cook, but his
singing gets on your nerves. One night he
comes in with the chuck, humming a song
about going home to Dixie.
“Wot yer talkin’ ter yerself fer?” asks
the Bluff, polite but sarcastic.
“I’m singing,” says Steve, and he goes
on with his humming. “Take me back, take
me back, ter Dixie-e-e.”
“Gripes, I’ll take yer back,” says the
Bluff. “An’ I’ll learn yer to sing a decent
——■ song, too. Get up on the table an’
sing ‘The Wil’ Colonial Boy.’ ”
Steve argues that he don’t know it, but
the Bluff catches him by the scruff and lifts
him on to th’ table.
THE WISE INVESTMENT.
“And was their daughter’s musical education a profitable venture?”
“Rather! They bought the houses on either side of them at half their value.”
“Come on, yer cow,” he says. “Sing th’
words after me, an’ sing ’em loud.”
He keeps Steve singing there fer about an
hour, beating time on his head with a shoul-
der of mutton, and now and then pouring-
gravy down his shirt. We kids him to stop
at last, but, of course, Steve clears out quick
as he can mount his bluey. Then we goes
back to the slushy’s cooking for another week.
There is cooks that come to the shed, but
as soon as they hears that the Bluff’s there
they shies off. We’re getting sick of it.
Still, none of us is game to set him.
It’s getting altogether too rough, when one
Sunday, after a. rotten dinner of burnt mut-
ton and soddy duff, we’s sitting about smok-
ing, sad-like, and a bloke leads his Matilda
up to the hut. He’s the queerest bird I ever
see.' He wears a little straw-hat like the
sort the young blokes does that works in
the stores in Forbes, an’ has draught-board
pants tucked up as if it’s raining. His coat
is one of them flogger affairs with braid
round the edges, and he wears a round bit
of glass in one of his eyes. He’s dressed
like a young bloke, but his dial’s as hard
as a belar stump, and he’s got that helpless
look on it you see on a broken-mouthed yowe
that’s bogged in a tank.
When he comes up he drops his swag—
and it’s rolled anyhow—takes off his hat
and bows to us like as if we’s at a dance
and him setting to partners.
“Aw, pawdon mai intwusion, gentlemen,”
he says ; “but—aw—could I obtain —aw—
employment here?”
A couple of the/ piece-pickers pulls his leg
for a bit, and has him swinging the little
glass on its string, when all of a sudden
the Bluff jumps up.
“Hey. Jook,” says he, “can yer cook?”
The little bloke takes his hat off and bows
to Blue Bluff.
“Aw, weally, I —aw —am an excellent
cook,” says he. “In fact, it would afford
me—aw—pleasuah to —aw —cook for you
gentlemen.”
This is just the juicy for us if he can
cook. We all tells him so, and the little
bloke flashes a bundle of references. Billy
the Dodger looks them over and says:
“Accordin’ ter these he can cook like hell.”
(Billy sometimes forgets himself if he’s ex-
cited. and uses strong words like that.)
“Cripes, he’ll wan’ ter,” says the Bluff in
a nasty tone. “I’m sick er bein’ poisoned.”
None of us has the heart to tell
the Bluff that it’s all his fault, but
Dodger whispers to me, “Only fer
that blue swine we’d have had
plenty er damn good tucker right
through.” (When you’ve known
Billy as long as me you forgives
him for forgetting himself and
using strong talk, so I don’t say
nothing.)
Anyhow, the Jook, for that’s
what we christens him, hops right
into it. At tea that night, when
we sits down, there’s a sort of hush
in the hut, like when the Bush
Brothers starts preachin’. As a
rule, a Sunday tea is a slap-dash
affair of cold meat and a bit o’
brownie. This night we has ris-
soles, and little pies with chopped-
up mutton in ’em, and stewed
prunes and some sort of rice con-
cerns that tasted fine. There’s
cakes with sawdust in the middle
—cocoanut Dodger says it is—and
tarts with insides made of jam.
After the blow-out we gives three
cheers fer the Jook.
The next week you would think
we’s living at the best pub in Con-
dobolin, and at the commercials’
table at that.
All this good tucker gets us
a bit collar-proud after a while,
but we don’t do our blocks. Me
being the rep. I has to see that the
Jook don’t run us into a heavy tucker
bill, so I checks his accounts. They’re right,
and a week before cut-out they show us
standing in less than sixteen bob a man per
week, and all the fancy tucker chucked in.
But of course Blue must have a chip in
the end. One Sunday, after we finishes a
little game of two-up, he sets to work wash-
ing a pair of pants and his old socks in a
kerosene-tin. He boils her on the galley
fire and sees the Jook making scones when
lie’s cutting up the soap.
“Who’s them scones for?” he wants to
know.
“Aw,” says the Jook, as if he’s apologising,
“they are for— ; aw—my chum, the book-
keepah, an old Hoxtonian, what?”
That settles it. Blue rages and storms
and ends up by grabbing the dish of scones,
snatching a tin of “bullocky’s joy” and wad-
ing in to finish the dozen or so there was.
While he’s eating the Jook is protesting, but
when the Bluff finishes the last one he grabs
the little bloke by the scruff and dumps him
outside.
As the Jook lights in the dust, the book-
keeper comes rushing down from the home-
stead as wild as a pleuroed bullock, and
props at the hut door. After being told of
the trouble he gets very solemn.
“Belvidere,” he says to the Jook, who’s
dusting himself, “did you—ah—see an old
baking-powdah tin at the end of the —ah —
shelf in the kitchen there? It was a very—
ah —-old tin, but there was half-a-pound of
—ah—strychnine in it. It was —ah—rab-
bit poison, don’t yer know. Have you
thrown it out, what?”
The Jook stares at him with a queer sort
of look like as if he’s ordered drinks for the
bar-full and suddenly finds lie’s not holding
a deener.
“Strychnine!” he yells, just as if he’s
coo-eeing to somebody ten mile away. He
bucks round a bit as though he has a touch
of the dry horrors ; finally he pulls up look-
ing at the book-keeper like he was Jimmy
Tyson come to life. Then he yells, “I
used it in the scones!” And he starts
to blubber as if he’s at a funeral and is
crying drunk.
In the kitchen we hears a horrible yell,
and then a bump on the floor. We all
rushes in and sees the Bluff kicking and
clutching at his belt and groaning terrible.
“I’m poisoned, I ate all them scones,” he
moans, and kicks a trestle from under the
plank table, letting the whole lot down on
top of himself. Some of the boys is getting
him clear when Dodger says to me:
“Serve the rotten swine right if he pegs.”
(Being excited the Dodger must have forgot
himself to use them strong words.)
None of us knows what’s wrong with Blue
until he tells us about the strychnine being
used in the scones instead of baking-powder.
Then we gets scared and stands round
watching him rolling on the floor and press-
ing on his stomach, but none of us can
think of anything much to do. Dodger ups
and says that when a dog’s poisoned if you
grab him by the hind legs and swing him
round a few times, it cures him. Three of
us catches the Bluff’s legs and starts to
swing, but his head hits a stool. He lets
go his stomach long enough to punch old
Cooper’s Crick, and then he falls out the
door and begins to kick about in the dust.
The Jook and the book-keeper tales a
hand. They says he’s got to have a
A BLANK CARTRIDGE.
FIRST LADY: “ft’s a wonder she hasn’t gone
off before this.”
SECOND DO .: “Fes, considering the amount of
'powder she uses.”
and they rushes into the kitchen and starts
mixing things up. First they comes out
with a pannikin full of mustard and water,
which they says Blue has to drink. It takes
11 of us to hold him, but we gets it down
his throat. After a while he’s terrible sick,
but they comes again, this time witli salt
and water. Every time he’s sick they has
a new sort of nemetic; and when, the
shearers is tired holding him and making him
drink it, we gets the shed-hands on the job,
and then the musterers and a few bagmen
from the travellers’ hut. We gives Blue
vinegar, old fat that the cook’s been saving
to sell to the Indian hawkers, half a pint of
goanna-oil that Dodger’s been using for his
saddle, grease they scrapes from the engine-
bearings, three bottles of Worcester sauce,
water they soaked tobacco in, suds out of
the tin he’s been washing his pants in, and
other mixtures that must have tasted worse
than they smelt.
After about two hours Blue looks real
bad. He’s weak as a knocked-up brumby,
and keeps on saying “My Gawd!” in a way
like as if he’s at church and trying to remem-
ber his prayers.
Jook and the book-keeper keeps talking to
themselves about him, saying he’ll have to
have a doctor and the coroner and the
police. Dodger suggests getting a ’phone ring
through to Doc. Starker.
“It’s no—ah —use,” says the book-keeper.
“The doctor will not come out heah unless
the —ah—station guarantees his fees. It’s
a long—ah—journey, what?”
This is a bit of a killer, so none of us
says nothing. But Blue is listening.
“I’ll pay th’ cow meself,” he groans.
“Ring him up. I’ve got 30 quid cornin’ ter me,
and he can have the lot if lie saves me life.”
The book-keeper’s a suspicious cove, so he
pulls a bit of paper out of his pocket and
writes an order on the station for the doctor’s
fee —28 quid he makes it, being 10 bob a
mile for the 56 miles from town. Then they
props Blue up and he makes a cross on it, and
the Jook and Dodger and the book-keeper
signs as witnesses and says “S’elp me Gawd.”
By this time the Bluff is crying and is
reckoning he won’t last till the doc. comes.
But they starts on him again with the old
fat and oil and some harness-dressing they
finds, and what with struggling against tak-
ing the stuff and being sick he hasn’t got
time to toss in his marble or send farewell
messages to his friends, if he has any.
About 9 o’clock the doc. comes in his car,
and the book-keeper and the Jook meets him
at the netting gate and tells him about it. He
comes in, looks at Blue, feels his pulse and
says “Hum !” Then he turns to us, where
we’re leaning about, dead knocked up.
“You did right, my men,” he says. “He’ll
live.”
We was a bit surprised that he done no-
thing to Blue, but, anyhow, he goes straight
off with the book-keeper, snatches his cheque
for the 28 frog-skins and teases his old car
back to town.
There’s not much bluff left in the Blue
bloke next morning, but he starts in shear-
ing again after smoko, acting very quiet.
That night when we finds the slushy cooking
again because the Jook and the book-keeper
has cleared out for Sydney, Blue don’t say
a word. All he does is rub his stomach.
But three days after, when I gets a let-
ter from Sydney signed “Belvidere Mont-
morency, alias the Jook,” telling that there
was no strychnine in the tin, that the scones
was ribuclc, and that the whole thing’s a
put-up joke between him and the book-
keeper, Blue done his block. I reads the
letter at dinner and there’s a dead silence
at first. Blue swears. But the boys start
to giggle. Then one says “Goanna-oil,” and
there’s a laugh. Then they start remem-
bering, and pretty soon they're all doubled
up. Some of ’em falls on the floor, some
has tears dripping down their beards, others
try to hit one another on the back. Not a
man of ’em can eat for choking.
On the board in the afternoon it’s dead
funny. There isn’t a sound for a minute
’cept the whir of the shafting and the hiss-
ing of the cutters on the combs. Then dll
of a sudden someone says, “An’ the water
he’s washin’ his pants an’ socks in !” The
machines is stopped, the sheep’s scrambling
about the board, and blokes is rolling on the
floor too weak to care what happens.
The Blue Bluff hooks it that nisht. He
don’t even stop for a settlement, although he
has over four quid coming. He never was
heard of on the Lachlan again. I was told
he was grooming at a shanty over in Vic.,
and when I mentions this to Dodder he says:
“I hope the dirty coot cuts out there.” But
Dodger had lost his pipe in the excitement,
and perhaps that’s why his language was so
strong.

The Ballad of Hell.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE outlaw of the Mulga Plains was
forty-nine hands high,
A fiery - bay with’ chestnut taiL 'and
large, sardonyx eye;
He led the brumby mobs for years with
wild heroic neigh,
The flash of stockwhips in the sun to him
was idle play.
His will was law where’er his hoof struck
firm Australian ground;
And boldest riders in the night would tremble
at the sound.
No man had thought to tame his pride or
use his awful speed;
But horsemen’s voices, hushed and low, dis-
cussed his form and breed —
A thoroughbred from hock to ear, in eye
and tooth and tail.
Men said that Bushfire sired the colt—his
dam was Western Mail—
For some such pedigree as that was in his
flaming glance ;
But Grogan came from Jilderie and saw
his sporting chance.
A horse that took but twenty strides to
cross the measured mile,
Whose leap could clear the tallest trees, was
just in Grogan’s style;
And Grogan, though in shape and size like
some brief son of Guelph,
In manger guile and stable lore was half a
horse himself.
His nose was long, his aspect sad, he sel-
dom deigned to laugh,
And when he did the sound was such as
horses make in chaff.
How Grogan brought the outlaw in no bush-
man ever knew,
But wondering teamsters saw him ride the
crimson sunset through ;
They saw him like a solemn child upon
that lofty back,
Perched high against the western clouds and
coming down the track.
His steed was weary from the ride, w’eary
and large and calm ;
He breathed no fire, but gently strode, staid
as an evening psalm.
When hobbled him that night and
let him freely graze
All Mulga Plain forgot to sleep and simply
stood at gaze.
And in the morning horse and man passed
silently away ;
For Grogan when his mind was set was
bound to make it pay.
So in the hot pursuit of cash he left the
plain behind —
And people who believed the tale were very
hard to find.
* * * *
The favorite for the Dustvale Cup was
Cornsaek’s Wandering Jew,
A speedy beast, as horses go, that all the
district knew;
But quadrupeds of various styles were en-
tered for the race,
Strange things on legs that no man paused
from distant sires to trace.
So Moses Cohen roared the odds —his ac-
cents rose and fell—
Till one drew near to ask what price the
rank outsider, Hell.
The punter seemed a weary soul from some
lost place afar
Where' only sand and silence wink through
branches at a star.
His whiskers, rusted with the sun, fell
slowly from his chin.
His eyes were mixed; beneath his hat his
hair was fierce and thin.
And, sagging from his hinder parts, his
trousers blurred his knees,
Held by one straining snakeskin belt to
save the decencies.
“Hell?” cried the bookie. “Twelve to one.”
It seemed a simple snap.
“In hundreds, mister,” said the sad and
rusty-whiskered chap.
Mac Aaron made the price fifteens; O’Joseph
stopped at tens.
All thought the stranger’s cash as good as
other sporting men’s;
But who or what this Hell might be no
man among them knew,
And cared still less, for mighty things
were told of Wandering Jew.
BUSH HOSPITALITY.
“I ain’t tidied hup yet, but if yer like ter
step inside I’ll make yer a drop o' tea.”
But when the horses for the Cup appeared
upon the track
Each mouth fell open, every face was one
astonished crack ;
And silence like a hill of lead upon the
landscape fell
Till someone faltered in his dream and mur-
mured : “What the hell!”
Yes, Hell in all his pride stood there—vast
shining, free from vice—
And Wandering Jew ard all the field were
like a string of mice.
What need to tell of such a race? ’Twas
w°n ere it began,
Hell finished in a gentle trot six furlongs in
the van.
BUt S* < h'is e hat Cl ° Sed hiS bafc °’ J ° se » h
And joined Mac Aaron in his flight across
the railway flat.
Long ere the crowd had ceased to yell thev
a j caught the eastward train
And +l Pe<^ from £ hat disastrous course across
the Great Grey Plain.
Bards long shall tell in furious verse of that
which then befell:
Ihe flying rogues were unaware that fate
pursued on Hell;
But Grogan had foreseen this chance and
gave his steed the rein,
that his mount could far outpace that
easy-natured train.
And soon the engine-driver heard loud hoof-
thuds in the rear
That gained upon his flying wheels and
thundered in his ear.
And then he saw with gasping breath -and
stiff, astonished hair,
And fell upon his shaking knees in agonies
ot prayer.
A pious engine-driver he, he saw that racing
bay, b
A horse from the Apocalypse that snorted
Judgment Day.
His mate who shovelled in the coal observed
with pagan eye
What seemed a monstrous jim-jam stoked
with fire to make him fly.
“Hell!” he remarked, and raked the flame
into a furious glow,
The while he urged his pious mate, “Oh,
crikey, let her go!”
The lever opened to the full, the furnace
roaring white,
The train went shrieking down the rails like
some mad thing in flight;
But Hell, now settled to his stride, still
kept his former place
Till Cohen on Mac Aaron gazed and both
were white of face.
“Hell wins!” O’Joseph sadly said; “the
books must bear the loss.”
Mac Aaron murmured solemnlv: “It is our
heavy cross.”
But Moses had a bright idea: “Our double
cross,” he cried.
A QUIET DEPARTURE.
“I hope you had, no angry words with your last mistress before leaving .”
“Oh dear, no; none whatever. I just locked the door while she was having her bath,
got my things together, and came away.”
“We’ll buy that beast that Flemington may
see him in his stride.”
And there and then they wrote a wire to
one of cash and fame
And told him in a secret code the vastness
of the game.
Why not repeat the deeds of Hell on courses
far away
And gather all the surplus wealth of one tre-
mendous day?
So when the worn-out engine paused, dry,
coal-less, crushed by miles.
The three who fled rose from their seats
and came across with smiles.
“We merely left the course,” they said, “to
view this matter well.
We three would like to buy your horse.
Please put a price on Hell.”
They paid the bets in large-sized notes and
Grogan’s lengthy nose
Was solemn as a Sunday thirst. He said,
“Well, I suppose
Ten thousand quid will buy the moke.” They
brought it down to eight.
Their cash would come by Tuesday night;
and Grogan said he’d wait.
.They saw great Hell like some still cow
nosing the dusty plain
And thrilled to think of flowing cash when
he should race again.
On Tuesday Grogan gave receipt for one bay
stallion, Hell,
And vanished softly in the dusk, but whither
none could tell.
A loose-box door had been enlarged and Hell
was safe within —
The greatest horse that stood on legs since
Satan thought of sin—
And Moses Cohen kept the key and bold
O’Joseph said
“All horses of all pedigrees we now consider
dead.”
Praise was in Zion. Israel sang, but paused
upon a word.
There came a noise unlike all sounds that
land had ever heard,
A noise as if five cities fell and storms had
wrecked ten ships,
As if a thirsty nation died with curses on its
lips,
As if the charging Light Brigade had dashed
across the Zoo
And someone with a cross-cut saw had sliced
the moon in two.
And there were other sounds as well that
filled them with despair,
For when they sought the loose-box door the
stable was not there.
The place was broken, roof and wall and
manger, lock and latch ;
The largest piece that could be found was
smaller than a match.
And Moses Cohen tore his hair, which proved
of little use;
For distant hoof-thuds on the air proclaimed
that Hell was loose.
Ah, well! The tears of Zion fell upon the
short, parched grass.
But neither stock-route, yard nor track be-
held the tall horse pass.
He vanished utterly away, like Grogan, in
the night,
Till most believed the tale a lie conceived for
their delight,
In fact, the doubters of the West around their
camp-fires tell
As champion perversiftage the simple tale of
Hell.
But in the utmost wild North-West beyond
the last red rim
Of sunset lies a phantom range of outline
blue and dim;
And there a lost prospector saw from fifty
miles away
A mighty horse in silhouette against the
skies of grey.
And someone mentioned Grogan’s name and
Grogan’s stallion Hell
Kept there to breed a giant stock to graze on
Israel.
N.S.W.
CURSE O' MOSES.
His Return.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
L\PPIN was one of the most picturesque
thieves in the A.I.F. He stole a
mother.
It happened, as it often happened in the
A.1.F., and often happens in strenuous and
risky enterprise anywhere, that two of the
most unlikely men became cobbers —Lappin
and Martin. For the good qualities and fight-
ing prowess of Lappin Martin was forgiven
many sins. Lappin was not quarrelsome;
but in a quarrel—usually the quarrel of
somebody else—be was a tiger. A tall,
sinewy man, capable of devilment, but liable
to long thoughtfulness, and in such times
showing a wistful expression of countenance,
he was a useful soldier and liked. Martin
wasn’t. There was no doubt about who suf-
fered and who benefited in the partnership;
but Lappin seemed satisfied. He was like
a guardian angel to Martin, anu became some-
thing of a conscience to him in trying to in-
duce him to remember to write to his mother.
Martin was a painful correspondent in any
case; and the “diners” he knew in England
and hoped to meet again when he got his
next leave exhausted all his energies. Even
they were forgotten for long intervals. After
all, an estaminet in France was a much
nearer and dearer thing than a “diner” in
England. Martin’s mother was, on the other
hand, a faithful correspondent; and when
her letters arrived that wistful expression
came upon the face of Lappin. He received
few letters himself; and it takes a soldier
to remember the deep heart-hurt of the man
who does not receive letters when he sees
them coming to others.
Lappin showed no envy, however; his
feeling was more of disgust. Martin’s in-
difference puzzled him.
“I haven’t a mother to write to me,” lie
would say. “Never knew one that I can recall.
I was a State kid as early as I can remem-
ber, and grew up on a farm where the missus
showed plainly I wasn’t any kid of hers.
But I reckon if I had a mother writing to
me her letters would be answered.”
“Better answer them yourself,” retorted
Martin one day, tossing a couple of letters —
one of them unopened—over to him.
Lappin seized on the chance to formulate
a plan. Thereafter he wrote letters, which
Martin recopied and sent. They had to be
short, or Martin would have kicked Hard
against even the simple labor of rewriting.
Thereafter Martin’s mother became a mutual
possession. It was quite natural that Lap-
pin, having to write the replies, should read
her letters : and this gave him a new interest
in life. He became an eager participant
rather than a wistful onlooker at the mail-
delivery.
Martin and Lappin went out with a raid-
ing party one night. The sector was a quiet
one, and the A.I.F. principle of insisting
upon being the masters of No Man’s Land
had met with little resistance. Creeping
cautiously through the wire, and moving
silently down to a stripped and battered
hedge, then down the depression which
afforded cover, the party checked suddenly,
and crouched at the sound of whispering
voices ahead. Some misty, grey shadows

sight; and, at a gesture from the raiding-
officer, the party moved again. The receding
shadows had finger-marked, as it were, a
way past the wire, and this the raiding party
followed. The sharp, guttural challenge of
the German sentry sounded, and was an-
swered by one of the shadows ahead. The
bombs flew then, and hardly had their ex-
plosions thrown confusion into the trench
before the party was amongst the disturbed
Huns. Caught unawares, and already
shocked by the arrival of the bombs, they
offered little resistance.
As a raiding party it had been a distinct
success; and it had not greatly disturbed
the German line. At some close-hafidy
machine-gun positions the crack of bonibs
had been heard, and the gUns “tUt-tUGtut-
tutted” aS they sprayed No Man’s Land.
That was all,
“Pass the word we’re going back,” whis-
pered the raid-officer. “Into the shell-holes
outside the wire first; and when the
machine-guns stop a bit we'll make a break
back,”
Lappin passed the word to Martin, who
had been “clearing up” the end of the
trench; then they crept out, through the
Wire and into the shell-holes, They had
hardly reached them before the mutter of the
machine-guns died, and the party moved
again.
Three colored lights shot into the air from
behind them. _ The faint, curious “pops”
of the Verey-light pistol sounded; and the
night i was flooded with ghastly light. In-
stinctively the party flattened to earth be-
fore the stars burst; then, as, hovering, they
fell, the whisper came to the rear men,
“Move quickly !” They scrambled after the
misty shapes that raced ahead of them. And
then the night rocked with an opening war
of sound. Above the “tut-tutting” of the
machine-guns and the swishing of their bul-
lets came the roar of big guns and the whir
and crash of flying shells; and. then our
own batteries burst into the argument. The
Germans —who had a good system of light-
signal fire-direction —were playing just be-
yond their wire, where the party had been
a few seconds before; our guns were seeking
artillery positions to handicap the fire.
Lappin and Martin tumbled, panting, into
a shell-hole just as a hail of machine-gun
bullets spat spitefully overhead. Close to
the ground they lay shaking; and something-
moved near them. ' A gleam from a Verey-
light, flashing into the hole, showed the
raid-officer.
“Someone was left in the trench,” he
panted. “Gave the alarm. Someone didn’t
clear-up properly. I’m going. You follow
in a second. The shells will be here soon—
creeping barrage. Keep apart.”
As he went, Lappin-turned to Martin.
“The end of the trench !” he said. “You
white-livered dog!”
Martin lay shivering, as if he would dig
his body into the soft shell-hole mud.
And then a shell landed with a concus-
sion that shook earth from the shell-rim upon
them. Flying shell-splinters tore up the soil
near them. Martin gave a moan of terror,
and Lappin felt him rising. His arm went
over him, keeping him down.
“Down, you fool!” he cried urgently. “We
can’t move through this. Keep as flat as
you can to dodge the pieces.”
The earth roared with explosions all
around them, shook and broke into pieces,
filling the air with dust and choking chemi-
cals. Breathing became an agony: and as
mud and earth in showers splashed around
them, the rush and plunk of whizzing iron
sang death-songs in their ears, sometimes
finishing with a vicious fizz as the hot metal
plunged into mud. Lappin’s lips were shut
tight; but Martin’s moans of terror were
so frequent that his mate did not notice the
sharp grunt that came from him as he died.
He found him dead when, after minutes
that seemed long, agonising hours, the bar-
rage passed on; and then suddenly, as lie
lay realising his own wounds—a hit in the
arm that made it numb and helnless and a
dull pain in the hack lie could not place
definitely—an idea came to him. Painfully
he made an exchange of papers.
“Look here —Martin? Your name’s Lap-
pin, isn’t it?” asked the sergeant at the
first-aid station of the broken Digger the
stretcher-bearers had brought in.
“No ; Lappin was my mate,” he said.

Palm Court adjoins the Ballroom, and the dancers find it easily accessible
when relaxation and refreshment are required. All that artistic taste, ingenuity
and capital can devise has been unsparingly lavished upon the creation of
Palm Court. With the roar of the city shut out by day, is it any wonder
that the Palm Court is the premier rendezvous for afternoon tea-parties;
and when the city is hushed by night it is the scene of joy and gaiety.


Station was to get a nurse to write to his
mother, explaining particularly that his arm
was injured too badly for her to receive
letters in his handwriting for some time.
That wounded arm stood him in good stead
later —in the letter he subsequently sent
typed to her and in regard to some signa-
tures required hy the A.I.F. about which
many questions might otherwise have been
asked. His mother’s letters showed a grate-
ful acknowledgment of the increased affec-
tion her son displayed and of the full and
newsy letters he sent her. And the soldier
glowed at every endearing phrase.
Then the end of the war came—and
difficulty. Lappin dodged it by securing
post-war training in England; 'and then
stayed on in employment which arose out
of it, gladly seizing the excuse of financial
benefit as an explanation of his delayed re-
turn. His arm, although its hurt still
excused the vague signature which footed
his letters, was healed completely and he
was an efficient employee.
Still his affectionate, long letters went to
the mother he had borrowed; and hers,
coming to him, satisfied his hunger for a
mother’s regard. His heart went out to-
wards Australia, and he felt that some day
he must return; yet he did not know how
to face it.
Eventually his return became necessary.
With the urgency of finding employment for
unemployed British ex-soldiers, it was be-
ginning to become a matter of patriotism
to discharge overseas men. His employers
felt that he had to go ; but, unwilling to dis-
charge him, they offered him work with a
branch of the firm in Australia. Starvation
faced him in England, and he had more than
himself to think about. So Lappin went.
As the ship came up the harbor there
was panic in Lappin’s breast—a panic that
had existed during the whole voyage. He
felt that his conduct had been wrong and
that he would be responsible for the broken
heart of the woman who would have to
learn that her son was dead. He had speci-
ally asked that no-one should/ meet thfe
vessel; and a strong impulse to postpone the
necessary explanation came to him. But
he saw how idle delay would be; and an
hour later he was at the house whose address
he had learnt so well.
There were two women on the verandah,
and they rose as the gate clicked. One of
them was young and helped the other to rise,
as Lappin ascended the steps.
“My Tom!” cried the old woman.
Her arms went out helplessly before her;
black goggles were before her eyes, but there
was apparently no sight behind them.
“Blind!’’ said Lappin’s soul within him, as
a tide of hope flooded his mind. He was
filled with a sudden courage to play a
part.
“Mother!” he cried ; and as his arms went
about her she kissed him frantically, and
the tears came. Then her arms came from
the back of his neck and the worn, broken
fingers touched his face. He felt that now
was the moment of discovery. His heart
stood still; but the mother made no sign,
only kissed him rapturously again.
“You have changed so much, Tom—even
your face,’’ she said. “And I never thought
you could write such letters. You were
always so thoughtless; but I knew that your
heart was good.”
The curious, questioning eyes of the
younger woman were upon him; his own
met them with a defiance. He led the older
woman back to her chair.
But wnen he could leave her, he took the
opportunity to seek the other woman, whose
searching glances had disturbed his new
resolution to remain Tom Martin.
“Miss Quinton,” he said, “how long—how
long have you known my mother?”
‘‘Since about a year after Tom Martin
enlisted,” she said, pronouncing the name
portentously. “She was alone in a little

The Claws of the Tiger.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THERE was trouble in the house of
Chung Yin. A usurper shared his
bed and sat at his board, consuming
his victuals with extreme gusto without any
thought of payment. And, withal, Chung
had no redress.
Possessed of little learning, but nurturing
a strong desire to pass the Civil Examina-
tions at Pekin and secure a post in the
Government service, Chung had, in a moment
of weakness, called to his aid the services
of a Krupper Bachelor, since when he had
known no peace of mind.
To be a Krupper Bachelor is to enjoy
many privileges, not the least of which is
living luxuriously without the need to work.
The Krupper Bachelor wears a special but-
ton indicative to the world that he is of the
and, at the time of the annual
laminations, is a much-sought-after person,
In addition to being a clever scholar he
is generally a rogue. He is always a clever
actor, as he needs to be to impersonate,
aft f year ’. va l rious students gifted
Wlttl a strong desire but no ability to pass
the Civil Examinations at Pekin. His fee
is of his own fixing, running generally to
plenty of opium and an abundance of strong
food.
“To live in your house and partake of
your food and drink,” was the price Whong
Pi had set upon his services at the time of
Chung Yin’s call. And now, with the exami-
nation successfully
passed, he refused
to leave such a
generous board.
Chung Yin was in
a quandary. When
too late he saw
that his ambition
had outpaced his
discretion. To call
the magistrate Lo
his aid and expose
the Krupper Bache-
lor would but dis-
close his own du-
plicity and bring-
down upon his own
head the wrath of
the authorities.
And to eject the
interloper by force
was out of the
question. For
Chung was a
coward: the
thought of personal
combat, eye to eye
and chest to chest,
turned his blood
to water and his
legs to palpitating
jellies. Until lie
could devise a
better plan Whong
Pi must remain his
unremunerative and
unwelcome guest.
In his extremity
Chung called upon
Woo Loo. Woo
Loo was the long-
est, thinnest and
strongest coolie in
Nanking. He was
six-feet-three in his
bare feet. He wore
no socks. He was
so thin that his
bones pushed the
skin out, and
when he walked
they rattled inside
him like pebbles in
a gourd. Woo's
thinness was
directly attri-
butable to what he ate. For Woo was a
victim of that most vicious form of the
opium habit—he ate the ash left in the
bottom of the pipe after the opium had been
smoked. He carried a small phial of it
hung on a dirty piece of string round his
neck, and ate it day and night. Woo’s
strength lay in the fact that he controlled
the Chinese coolies of Nanking more surely
than general ever controlled an army. To
a man the coolies danced when Woo Loo
pulled the strings. If you wished to be
rid of a rival or an enemy, you called upon
Woo Loo, and your rival or enemy troubled
you no more. If you wanted a hundred
men for a navvying job, you saw Woo Loo
and the work was as good as done. If
you imagined yourself a Chinese Napoleon
and desired to raid a neighboring village in
the dead of night, you acquainted Woo Loo
of your martial aspirations and went to
buckle on your rusty sword. Woo was also
in the way of being an alchemist.
“Does the tiger fear the rat?” asked
Woo Loo at the end of Chung’s recital of his
troubles.
Uncertain which animal he was meant to
be, Chung made no reply.
“He who consumes the bones of the tiger
becomes as the tiger,” said Woo, reaching
into a box at his feet and drawing out a
small, flat package. “Tiger-bone dust,” he
continued. “One pinch of it before meals,
and within the week the defiler will run
before your wrath. It is very precious.
Two whole tael it will cost you.”
_ Breathless at once at the price and possi-
bilities opening before him, Chung paid the
two tael and departed.
It was strong medicine. Never in his
wildest dreams had Chung imagined such
an elixir of strength to exist. With the
first dose he felt his courage rise. Ever
since the coming of the Krupper he had
risen before the sun to toil in his garden
that it might produce the wherewithal to
feed the voracious interloper ; now he dared,
this very first morning, to lie abed until
the sun was as high as a tall tree above the
horizon. Closely scrutinising Whong Pi
while he ravenously consumed the dried fish
and rice of the breakfast table, Chung was
surprised and delighted. Whong was not
such a big man, after all. Of his body only
the upper chest and head showed above the
low table level. And in his voice, which
previously had filled the whole room, a
decidedly feminine squeak was clearly dis-
cernible. Three times during tne meal
Chung arose, his mind and bosom ablaze
with righteous indignation, only to sit down
abruptly as the Krupper raised his head.
Clearly the powder had not yet done its
work. But if this was the effect of only
three pinches, what would happen to Whong
Pi when the whole: package got in its good
work? Well content, Chung worked only
till midday and spent the afternoon watch-
ing the theatricals.
_ At the end of the week Chung was a little
disheartened. Though all the powder was
gone, he had not yet generated sufficient cour-
age to throw the Krupper out. Several times
he had been on the verge of doing so. Once he
had actually rounded the table to grapple
with the intruder, but somehow the sight of
Whong Pi’s hands had halted him. They
were most capable-looking hands. Each time
he looked at them they reminded Chung of
a pair of well-cured hams. While the powder
undoubtedly had diminished Whong’s stature,
it somehow had failed to work on his hands.
The sight of them made Chung’s face feel
sore.
Determined to be master in his own house,
Chung again visited Woo Loo.
‘‘The powder was of the bones of a mena-
gerie tiger,” said Woo Loo when Chung had
told his tale. “Close contact with humans
must have sapped its ferocity and courage.
Here is the dust of a man-killer. A striped
manltiller of India. Five whole tael did
it cost me on the quay last week. For only
six tael shall you have it to make up for
the last. Consume the whole within two
days. There will be no mistake this time.”
Impatient of delay, Chung took of it
liberally immediately he reached home. Woo
Loo had not lied. It was most potent medi-
eiiie. .As Chung paced his room he could
feel his courage rise. He could not sleep,
so vital was its strength. It was indeed the
dust of a true mankiller. At breakfast next
morning Chung felt like a giant for the first
time in his life. Across the table Whong Pi
sank into insignificance. And his hands also
were small. They were no bigger than a
lady’s foot. Soft and most incapable
hands.
But Chung was cautious. Along with
the courage of the tiger he had got some of
its cunning. When finally he moved against
Whong Pi there must be no mistake. It
would be well to test his courage first. Loung-
ing in the doorway, his work neglected, Chung
was turning the matter over in his mind
when a man approached down the street.
Beforetime Chung had always vanished on
the approach of this man, a shopkeeper of
the bazaar, to whom he owed more money
than he cared to think about. To-day Chung
did not move. As the merchant came closer
Chung was delighted. to feel that his knees
did not tremble or his feet make to retreat.
The powder was working. There were
numerous reasons why Chung should have
quietly disappeared until his creditor had
passed. There was no reason at all why he
should have molested him. But with the
dust of the mankiller strong upon him,
Chung was not his own master. As the
shopkeeper came abreast with a scowl on
his face and made as if to stop, (jhung
sprang. Two minutes only did Chung take
to assert himself, and when he finally swag-
gered through his door the most astonished
merchant in Nanking arose with the dust of
conflict upon him and hastened back the
way he had come, leaving three of his teeth
and much dignity.
Chung was in ecstasy. The courage of the
tiger was truly his. At last he would avenge
the insults put upon him and rid his house
of the loafing Krupper Bachelor. Swallow-
ing the balance of the powder at one gulp he
stamped from the room in search of the
despoiler.
It was an epic struggle. Surprised at the
unsuspected ferocity of his former host,
Whong Pi put up but a poor fight. As they
fell through the door and out into the street
he was underneath, with Chung Yin’s teeth
securely fastened in his ear. The rapid gather-
ing of numerous chattering spectators who
formed a rough ring round the pair infused
Whong with greater strength, but against
the savagery of Chung’s attack it availed him
not at all. Prom a meek sucking-dove, Chung
Yin had changed to a raging tiger, and with
the tiger’s high disregard for the rules of
the game he bit and scratched and tore at
his adversary until it seemed that his pur-
pose was to make a meal of him. Heartened
by the encouraging cries of the spectators.
Chung’s courage knew no obstacle. Like a
cat playing with a mouse, he tossed and threw
Whong Pi about in a cloud of dust which
choked alike the applause and imprecations
of onlookers and combatants.
It was a gong sounding up the street that
stopped the combat. The best fight did not
warrant missing the sight of a prisoner being
whipped through the streets. Especially as
THE MAN WHO KNEW.
“We women bear pain better than men."
“Who told you that? Your doctor?"
“No, my shoemaker."
the fight could so easily be resumed. As the
crowd broke and rushed to the scene of the
new sensation, Chung- released his hold of
his enemy’s nose, and, sitting side by side
in the dusty road, they watched the approach
of the procession of three, the leader clang-
ing his gong every 20 seconds, the prisoner
in the middle crying the crime of which he
had been found guilty, and, bringing up the
rear, the man with! the whip which
he used upon the prisoner at each
clang of the gong. As they came
nearer, something in the prisoner’s bear-
ing seemed familiar to Chung. He held
his head in a way which Chung felt certain
he had noticed before. But as he was dressed
only in a dirty clout that the whip strokes
should be the better felt, it was difficult to
distinguish him from the scores of other
nearly-naked vagabonds who crowded about
him. It w-as his words as he came opposite
that confirmed Chung’s suspicion. In a loud
voice that all might hear he cried his shame:
“A trickster am I. For selling powdered
chicken-bone as the dust of the tiger’s claws
am I w-hipped.”
Until long after the criminal had dis-
appeared round the corner Chung couli hear
his monotonous cry, interspersed with the
ribald jests of the accompanying throng. But
to the later return of the crowd to the scene
of the fight he paid no heed as h e busied
himself in his garden producing the where-
withal to feed his voracious guest, who
lounged in the warm sun with his back to
the wall, puffing clouds of fragrant smoke
from a thin cigarette.

Cannibal A and Cannibal B: An
Idyll of the South Pacific.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BRAVE Cannibal A and sweet Canni-
bal B
Lived in two thatched huts on the
rim of the sea,
On the rim of the sea, all sapphire-blue,
And, oh, with a sky that was sapphire too!
But ne’er was a love like Cannibal A’s
For his Cannibal B, ’twas beyond all praise,
As he eyed her and wooed her, his Canni-
bal B,
In the shade of the huts by the rim of the
sea.
The day was calm ; just a faint breath of air
Stirred the palms into sighing, and B’s
bright hair,
As he eyed her and wooed her, his Canni-
bal B,
On the sand past the huts on the rim of the
sea.
Past the pavement of bones that her sire he
had laid
’Tween the huts for her brown, tiny toes to
parade.
Oh! Cannibal A was a warrior bold,
And, oh! the wild stories of him that were
told,
Too rude for the ears of the gentle to hear:
There was blood on his hatchet, his knife and
his spear;
Yet fond (as they said at his club) of good
cheer,
A trencherman bold when the rub-a-dub-dub
Spoke the tom-tom that made them roll up
at the club.
The Lord of the Feast, sire of Cannibal B,
In the hall of his fathers beside the salt sea,
Had sternly decreed it and made it a rule,
To be kept and observed as by scholars at
school,
That each guest as he rose from the table
replete
Should, ere he sat down for a smoke on the
seat,
Be measured (waist-measured) so that he
should see
Which. of all was the man of the highest
degree.
So the chief as he rose passed the brown
tappa tape
(As the others looked on with their mouths
all agape)
Round the swell of the waist of Cannibal A,
Ilis henchman, his pride, his prize-trencher-
man A.
Nine feet he was round and three feet he
was through
As he stood without socks by the sea-rim
blue.
“A lady’s fancy, as all must see.”
Those others they whisper’d of Cannibal B.
Full proud was Cannibal A that night,
His hair with good shark-oil beaming bright;
A pearl-shell on his breast he hung,
And slow, as he marched, a love-song sung
As he faTed along by the rim of the sea
To clasp to his bosom sweet Cannibal B.
Cannibal B she was coy at the first;
To look on her lover she barely durst.
She of all maids his dearest dear,
With a scarlet hibiscus behind each ear;
Rings of pearl on her pretty toes,
And a stripe of red down her beautiful nose!
Cannibal A he rolled his' eyes
As he gazed on the charms of his peerless
prize,
Of his lovely, his beauteous Cannibal B,
As they met ’neath the moon oh the rim of
the sea.
For love as for kava now madly athirst,
He sighed such a sigh as his waist-belt nigh
burst,
And his huge, heavy club as it fell from his
hand
Left its mark on the moon-whiten’d face of
the strand.
And then (not a second’s, a moment’s delay)
He sat down on the sand by the moon-silver’d
bay—
Sat down on the sand where with her by
his side
He mused on the feast with a touch of just
pride
And told of the eating and drinking that
were,
Of how he had taken his very fair share, •
Of how the chief spanned the huge bulk of
his waist,
And in the red archives his record had placed.
All this to his loveliest Cannibal B,
Locked in her arms by the rim of the sea.
* * * *
“I love you, I love you, I love you,” sobbed
she,
“I want you so much ; I’ve no mind to be
free,
But e’er to remain your own Cannibal B.”
“I feel (for ’tis late!) as though I could sup,
Oh! I love you so much I could just eat
you up,
Except that to-morrow I’d be all alone
Beside the sad sea here and making my
moan.”
“Oh, say that you love me! Dear, say it
again,
With a joy in the tone, sweet as sugar of
cane,
That for love in your heart you could eat
me all up,
Without further need of a bite or a sup.”
“But,” ’twas thus he riposted, brave Canni-
bal A,
“The fact is, I’ve had too much dinner to-
day
My appetite’s fled. Yes, bear witness, O sea,
I ivould but I can't eat you, my Cannibal B.”
* * * *
He died of a surfeit out there on the shore,
And the place that once knew him it knew
him no more.
But the cannibal maidens once loud in their
wail
Next day told us smiling a prettier tale
Of the loves of the pair in those huts by the
sea—
Brave trencherman A and sweet Cannibal B.
VICTORIA.

Expiation.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A BIG two-seater car droned through the
haze of an autumn day. A woman
and a girl were in it, and the girl was
driving. Half an hour earlier they had
dropped from the range of hills on their
left, and now they were skirting the opal-
smooth and yet restless ocean. In front a
tall headland jutted into the sea. They had
just time to glimpse the eager Pacific rollers
bursting processionally along its curved base
of rocks, and they were on the hill with the
swaying, sighing water far below.
“Oh, mummy, how glorious life is!” sighed
the girl, with a glance at the silent figure by
her side.
She had a rich and jolly young voice. Her
grey eyes were wide and friendly, and her
small round face glowed with health and
happiness. An enchanting little creature:
one who, in the old phrase, was “just
husband-high”—a divine time of life when
maidens love everything out of their desire
to be loved.
Her mother stirred, and peered dispiritedly
over the wind-screen. She was, perhaps,
40; her features were still delicate, her hair
abundant, her figure straight and slim. Yet
she no more drew the eye than a grate in
which the fire has burnt itself out. Some
faces are benign, full of encouragement when
the coffin-lid closes over them : they never die.
In others the glow cast by the foolish ardors
and generosities of youth soon fades, leaving
them as blank as death-masks. Mrs. Esterton
was a good woman, a religious woman, a
successful woman. All who knew her, all
who had ever heard of her, were agreed
MIXING IT WITH ART.
THE COUNTRY-BRED : “Yer ploughin’ a hit skew-wiff, mate.”
BLOBBS ( ex-artist, now on the land): “Well, maybe; hut you must admit, old chap,
that the effect is—er — well, jolly at tistic.”
about that. But the face she showed the
world was as bleakly unemotional as that of
a gaol-wardress: it had not been alive for
years.
“I dread to hear you talk of life, Phil.
You expect too much from it.”
“But, darling, hasn’t one a right to expect
a few happinesses mixed up with the nasti-
nesses? That’s all I ask.”
“You don’t understand things. You don’t
realise the dangers”——
“Happiness to me doesn’t necessarily mean
cars and clothes and parties. Suppose I
fell in love with a poor man, or an invalid.
I could get my happiness looking after him.
I know I could. Sacrifice is happiness—
perhaps the most beautiful sort of all”
Mrs. Esterton turned, startled and appre-
hensive. “Who on earth has put such ideas
into your head? Never, never say things like
that again; never even think them. There is
no happiness in sacrifice.” Her voice be-
came more vehement. “There’s destruction
in it. Disaster.”
As they swept round a corner the ear
bumped softly on a small object by the road-
side, and they heard a yelp. Phil went
white. “It’s a dog,” she said, and reached
for the brake.
“Drive on. We can do no good now.”
“I can’t leave it. I must see what has
happened.” She had reversed the car, and
was craning behind as she spoke. A man
stood by the corner, listening intently, but
unable apparently to place where the dog
was. Phi], who had jumped out of the car,
picked the’little thing up and carried it to
him. He was a middle-aged tramp. One eye
was hidden by an oval shade, and in the
shabby coat which flapped from his wasted
shoulders she noticed a soldier’s badge.
“Oh, dear! I can’t tell you how dread-
fully sorry I am,” she began, looking at the
dog, which lay inert in her arms, a paw
drooping pitifully and a thin stream of
blood trickling from its mouth on to its
rusty chest.
“I know you didn’t mean it,” he said, in
a voice of gentle distinction.
At the familiar sound the animal
struggled.
“I’ll take him,” said the man ; “thanks for
picking him up. I couldn’t see him. One
of these is gone,” and he pointed to the
shade, “and the other isn’t much use.”
Weeping, she watched her victim trying
with its blood-stained tongue to lick its
master’s hand. The beady brown eyes had
lost their terrified look, and were beginning
to glaze.
“I’m afraid we separate here, for a while,
old friend,” said the tramp into the dog’s
dusty little ear. Its tail wagged feebly, and
was still.
He looked up.
“Don’t you worry, miss. In a way this may
be all for the best. I mean to try to get into
the Hospice when I reach Sydney.” He
tapped his chest. “I’m a T.B. case—very
nearly done for. They mightn’t have had
him, and I couldn’t have left him. We’ve
been together for too long.”
She was appalled by the vastness of this
tragedy which had come into her life out of
the blue sky.
“I can’t leave you like this. Where do
you live?”
“Nowhere.”
“Have you no relations or friends?”
“None that want to see me.”
“Will you let me drive you to Sydney?”
“I’d rather not, thanks. I don’t want
to appear ungracious. Although I can’t see
you very well, I know what a sweet and
good child you are. But I’m more contented
alone.”
“Will you tell me your name so that I
may call on you at the Hospice?”
“Paul Cleland.”
The woman in the car, who had been sit-
ting upright, fearful of missing anything,
nodded in confirmation of her thoughts. She
turned cautiously and, herself unseen, scruti-
nised the speaker. What she saw appeared
to satisfy her. With a grim smile she sub-
sided once more into her corner.
And as she crouched there her mind was
away among the memories of 18 years back.
It was May Day. For the rest of her life
she was to remember the date.
Her husband was going up-country that
night: he had arranged to dine at his club.
Her personal maid was out.
At half-past eight she heard Paul, who
had been her lover for the past three months,
walk through the open French windows of
the library.
She had entered on her new life with a
troubled mind. She possessed religious prin-
ciples ; and in church as she listened to the
plain language of the Bible concerning wives
of her stamp, she felt abashed to the dust.
She was a born conformer: she grew panic-
stricken at the thought that people suspected,
were talking about her. But Paul’s presence
induced a vertigo which she could not resist.
She experienced it at the sound of his step
on the landing outside her bedroom, and her
terrors were momentarily gone as she slipped
into his arms, and whispered in his ear.
His hold on her tightened. “There’s only
one thing for it, now, dear. . We’ll have to
clear out.”
“What do you mean?” There was anger
as well as astonishment in her voice.
“What I say. I’ve felt enough of a hound
all along, God knows! but this puts the lid
on it. I have a few hundreds of my own.
We’ll go away somewhere and start afresh.”
She gasped. “You’re mad! You expect
me to give up my home and my position. And
at this crisis in my life of all others !”
“Don’t you love me enough to sacrifice
something for me? I would for you if our
positions were reversed.”
“I don’t admit the sense of the sacrifice
you suggest. Besides which, it would spoil
everything. To me part of the beauty of our
love has been the thought that it was a
divine secret between ourselves, with nobod:
suspecting we even knew each other. And
you want to vulgarise it all, and ruin us
both at the same time!”
“I want to have you to myself, to feel that
the baby is really mine, and to work for
you. Isn’t that sensible and natural? And
then, also, I want to take my medicine, make
expiation, and afterwards hold my head up
again. Say you understand, treasure. I)o
say you understand.”
“I don't understand. You’re talking in-
sanity.” Her eyes narrowed. “You’ve been
trying to preach at me for some time now,
Paul. Hinting at what sinners we both are,
snivelling about doing the right thing. If
that’s the sort of man you are it’s a pity you
ever began—this. And it’s a wonder you
have been able to go on so long creeping in
and out of places, skulking like”
“Hush!” he whispered. “What’s that?”
They could see the lights of a car outside
the closed gates of the drive. As they
watched a heavy form emerged from the
gloom of the trees and approached the house.
“It’s James!” she moaned. “James!” She
turned from the window in a blaze of fury.
“You fool! You canting fool! You would
come here to-night. And now look wliaL
you’ve landed me in ! Ruin ! Utter ruin !”
He seized one of her shaking hands in a
powerful grasp. “You’re not ruined,” he
said. “Pull yourself together. Sit in that
chair and wait.” While lie spoke he was
covering his mouth and nose with a piece of
black silk he had snatched from the dressing-
table.
He reached the drawing-room as James
arrived outside the library windows. A
stupefied exclamation floated in from the ver-
andah, followed by a booming cry: “Edith !
Come downstairs! What fool has left the
house open at this time of night?”
Three seconds later the drawing-room
opened quickly, and Esterton was upon him.
Paul fought: he understood that burglars
caught with their pockets full of loot usually
did fight. But his adversary was a powerful
man, battling in a just cause.
He came to from a blow on the temple,
delivered by a heavy candlestick, to find him-
self lying bound on the floor. James* was
telling the police what had happened.
“And when I got a chance to examine him,
who do you think he turned out to be? A
youngster named Cleland: a clerk in the
office of my own solicitor. Heard I was
going up-country, no doubt, and decided to do
this job while I was away. I’ve never been
so pleased about missing a train in my
life.”
The Judge who sentenced Paul sympa-
thised with the prisoner’s family, members
of which had been esteemed officers of that
very court, and he deplored the prisoner’s
youth, but in the aggravated circumstances
ho ■ could not see his way clear to make it
less than three years’ penal servitude.
Mrs. Esterton never had another love
affair. The capacity for passion seemed to
have died in her. However, she retained the
capacity to hate. The, traditional dislike
people feei for those they have wronged is
a feeble emotion by comparison with the
monomaniacal resentment which a sinner
who takes the high ground, and stays there,
often inspires in an accomplice who has
Proved incapable of such a gesture.
A week or so after Phil’s second birthday
she heard from P’aul. He had been out of
gaol for several months. She was not to
worry. He was well, and—though he knew
they would never meet again—happy. He
prayed continually for her happiness.
Speechless with indignation she tore the
note into small pieces.
At odd intervals in the years that followed
she heard of him through James, who re-
tained an interest in a career which he felt
he had done •something to mould.
He was poor and a failure. Yet always
in answer to her question, “Do they say he
worries? Is he unhappy?” the maddening
answer would come : “Unhappy ! Good God,
no! Coves of his sort have no sense of
shame.”
He dared to hold himself above her, who
had never sinned till she met him !
He dared to be a standing criticism of her,
who had not sinned since he had passed out
of her life !
He dared to be happy, when her heart ached
with shameful regrets each time she looked
at Phil!
A great doctor who had attended him in
a war hospital was a friend of theirs. “A
queer case,” he remarked one night at din-
ner. “Sight nearly gone ; lungs going fast;
and yet he is what one might call at peace.
Not many of us who are without his disabili-
ties can say as much.”
She could have screamed.
_ Now, anyhow, it was over. She had seen
him, broken and in despair. They were both
in. the same boat, at last.
- * * * *
She was startled by Phil’s gay young voice.
“Wake up. dearest. We’re off again.”
Her unhappy gaze rested on the other’s
gracious little profile ais the car began to
move.
“You seem cheerful,” she said.
“I am.”
“Do you know the man you have been
with?”
“His name is Cleland.”
“Yes. Your father had him put in prison.”
“I thought I had heard the name before.
He should never have been in prison, mummy.
Prison is for bad people, and this man could
never have beep, properly bad.”
The hot blood surged to Mrs. Esterton’s
brain. Would it never end?
“I tell you he is bad. He’s a. vile thief—
and he is fortunate not to be a murderer.”
The girl smiled with the supreme toler-
ance of youth for the follies of age. “That’s
only the theory of a stupid old Judge and
jury. I don’t theorise; I know. Shall I tel!
you why I’m hapny instead of broken-hearted
at having killed his dear little dog? Because
he’s happy. I don’t go so much on what
said; in point of fact, he said hardly asv-
thing. It’s something in the expression of
the face. A sort of steady light. A glow.
One can’t mistake it. All his troubles, his
real troubles, must have ended long ag0....
Why, darling, darling mumsy, what’s * the
matter ?”
Huddled away in her corner Mrs. Esterton
was crying stormily, unrestrainedly, in an
ecstasy of hopeless woe.

A Bohemian in Suburbia.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ r WON’T stand it any longer,” said
I Tewks. banging the marble top of the
table as lie addressed his companions
in iniquity. The iniquity in this instance
was the Burgundy before them in the Bohe-
mian wine-bar where they were sitting.
“What’s this?” said O’Swivel, coming up
behind him while lie made this defiance to
ihe somnolent figure of Lemmons and the
lank amiability of Splitter.
“Quarrel—Dora,” explained Lemmons in
a laconic yet ponderous manner.
"Never!” cried O’Swivel. “Do not tell
me the idyllic beauty of that romance is
shattered. Another ideal gone! I will never
believe more that a true heart beats beneath
the lace of a barmaid’s blouse.”
"It’s no good,” interrupted Tewks. “It’s
not funny. I went in to see her this after
noon, and there she was kissing those Dutch
sailors again. It was their being Dutch that
annoyed me most. When they’d gone I told
her she was faithless, and she’d ruined the
picture I was painting, as Life had nothing
left in it now. She said she had to kiss the
customers or she’d get the sack. 'I suppose
that’s why you kiss me?’ I said, and left
her.”
"Well, the wine-bar’s open to-morrow,”
said O’Swivel.
"I’ll never set my foot inside it again.
I’ve had enough of these wine-bar girls. I
need a real affair, a grand passion. Then
I’ll get my picture finished,” replied Tewks
firmly; TJ’Ve felt it for some time.” Lean-
ing forwards he went on confidentially:
“I’ve fell 'it coming; this is no sud-
den conclusion. I must fall really in love
with someone hard to get who will drag me
through Hell.’L "His voice became almost
joyful at the thought. "It's Hell I need
to bring cut; my
Itest and- finish .limit
picture.”
it’s only
Hell you want.” said
O’Swivel, 1 “why not
get drunk on this
place’s claret? It’s
guaranteed fto turn
ever ostriches dys-
peptic.”
“I mean a men-
tal hell.” replied
Tewks. "Aly soul,
not my stomach.”
“Ah, I understand,”
said O’Swivel com-
passionately. “D i d
you hear that, Lem-
mons? His soul is
a-thirst for love.
What shall we do
with him?”
“Take him out,”
said Lemmons with
great deliberation, in
the tones of a strong
man holding down
terrific anger, “and
drown him.”
“G o o d,” said
O’Swivel; “and
what then?”'
“Drown him
again,” Lemmons re-
torted m a gni licen tly,
and dismissed the
subject with a scorn-
ful gesture. The
company showed its
willingness to com-
mence this -process
by 1 ordering some
more Burgundy, and
Tewks was mortified
to find his soul
thrust- out of the
conversation as of
slight interest.
Tilting back his
chair against the
wall, and staring at
his reflection in the
mirror opposite, he
mused on his own
great romantic
charm of appearance
and the failure of
the feminine world to realise this at a
glance. He solaced himself with the maxim
that, women are fools, and continued pon-
dering how he might find the Tragedy Queen
of liis need, the Dark Lady who would wreck
his soul. The Dora whom he had renounced
served in a rather malodorous wine-bar
further down the street, and lately he had
spent there all that he could earn or borrow.
It was somewhat expensive, for the
regular procedure was that if you ordered
a glass of wine for yourself you also ordered
one for the barmaid who attended you, which
sin l mostly took out in lemonade or
water.
Suddenly he had an inspiration. How was
it he had not remembered before! Clinker,
who shared the attic with him, had a pair
of mysterious aunts with whom, as a matter
of duty, lie went to stay about every three
months. But it was not to the aunts that
his thoughts turned. Some weeks ago he
and Clinker had met an aunt in the street,
and Clinker had spoken to her while Tewks
retired hurriedly into a near-by bar. In
a flash he had seen somebody in a bonnet,
with a fine-looking girl of about 18 years at
her side. He learned from a reluctant
Clinker that this was a cousin of his who
had been staying with the aunts for a while.
He recollected now that Clinker generally asked
him dubiously, “I don’t suppose you’d like
to come, would you?” The invitation he
had always turned down with contumely,
adding a few reflections on the disgrace of
mixing with suburbanites. A visit was due
this week-end: lie would go, too. Imagi-
nation quailed before the vista opened. “If
a man can’t win a girl in two days he, doesn’t
deserve her,” he thought, and was so filled
with enthusiasm that he joined loudly in a
discussion as to what pranks Panurge would
have committed if he had gone to an art
school and had to mix with feminine art
students, those beings abhorred of the male
of the art community.
Clinker received his acceptance of the
carelessly-tendered invitation with something
like dismay. “Yon know I wouldn’t advise
you to come, old man,” he said. "I know
you wouldn’t,” replied Tewks, and squashed
all further remonstrances. They caught the
train together, and arrived at the suburb
where the aunts lived. The house before
which Clinker stopped was a very neat,
medium-sized cottage in about half-an-acre
of ground. At the back was some “scrub.”
Rubbing his hair with his hands, and making
it even a little more untidy than before,
Tewks entered the gate with his friend, and
stood on the doormat with that peculiar sink-
ing sensation that is only felt before a
strange and possibly hostile door. It is par-
ticularly well known to all who are in the
habit of calling on editors.
One of the aunts opened the door, and they
slunk in. “Aly dear, who’s this?” she said,
seeing Tewks.
“Oh, just my friend,” said Clinker. "I
thought I’d bring him along. He lives with
me, you know.”
This aunt, who was Theresa by name, was
small, shrivelled, angular, thin-lipped and
spectacled: the absolute personification of
that horror of Tewks’s life. Alethodistic
suburbanism. His worst fears were
realised, but he felt lie would have
been sorry if she had fallen in any
respect below the dread symbol he car-
ried in his mind. She disappeared, and was
heard whispering in the next room to Aunt
Alaria, till after a while they both came out,
having made up their minds to make the
best of the unwelcome guest. The second
Aunt (the term is used here with a capital
letter to signify a special species of human-
ity, of which almost every family has speci-
mens) looked exactly the same as the first.
The only real difference was that she didn’t
have whalebone in her lace-collar. Tewks,
of course, was not. aware of this, and to
his eyes they seemed identical. He was
finally able to tell them apart by discover-
ing an extra wrinkle in the forehead of one,
which he used as an identifying card.
The two youths were led into a prim
drawing-room full of photographs and bam-
NOT ALL ON ONE SIDE.
"I .suppose Doris mil be learning things now that she has married the Professor.”
"Um, pcs; but I oness the Professor is going to find out a thing or two as well.”
boo furniture, in which the mantelpiece was
surmdunted by a framed text, “Thou, Lord,
Seest Ale,” with an omniscient eye glaring
down. Tewks tried to find a seat where
this perpetually denunciatory optic did not
seem fixed on him, and sat silent while the
two aunts flurried round somewhere in the
hack getting tea. He found later that they
did everything together; each repeated any
remark the other made, and they could hardly
even pass the salt single-handed. They now
brought in the tea and some arid biscuits.
After lie had said that the weather was
rather hot five times, and four times that lie
liked being out of town, Tewks’s heart was
filled with a terrible fear. The girl had not
appeared. Had he let himself in for this
fruitlessly? The old maids sat straight on
their chairs with their gaze riveted on the
Angry Eye, as though to make sure it never
winked, but stared always at their moral
and spinal rectitude. Tewks was frightened
to make any reference to the girl, and though
they were released after a while, he hung
over the abyss of his uncertainty till the
lunch-hour.
Just before they sat down at the table
the hell rang, the girl was let in and intro-
duced as Marjorie. She greeted Tewks very
coldly; but he was relieved to see that she
also did not seem to take much notice. of
her cousin, either. “Repressed in this place,
I suppose,” he thought. “She’ll be all the
more emotional once she’s let loose. It’s
my job to find where to puncture the shell
of her repression, ah, ha !”
The grace, of course, found him with
knife and fork in hand, and the concerted
look of rebuke he received turned his soul
to vinegar. The worst part, however, was
that lie felt an almost irresistible desire
coming over him to stand up and recite some
passages out of Rabelais which he knew by
heart, and which would petrify the aunt's
with horror. The eornbeef choked in his
throat; he drank some tea down the wrong
way and spluttered, all of which antics com-
bined to set the aunts in one frigid attitude
of reproach towards him. He glued his eyes
on the salt-cellar, and tried to say the alpha-
bet backwards to keep his mind away from
awful thoughts.
After lunch Marjorie and her cousin dis-
appeared, and Tewks was reduced to read-
ing some sermons in the ..front room and
meditating tortures for his late friend.
Every now and then an aunt looked in dis-
approvingly and vanished. Finally Clinker
returned and explained to the suspicious
Tewks that he had been by himself develop-
ing some photos. When asked to show them
lie said they’d gone wrong and he’d destroyed
them.
When dinner came Tewks decided he muse
make a beginning somewhere, and so would
try to conciliate the aunts.
‘‘l often wonder why Eve ate that apple,”
he said, seeing some peaches on the table.
"I like peaches much better, and there must
have been tons of them in Eden.”
“Do not jest about serious subjects, Mr.
Tewks,” said Aunt Theresa: “not in, this
house.”
And Aunt Maria echoed: “Not in this
house.”
There was a long silence, but after ,a
while Tewks made another effort to be
Biblical.
“Fine old chap David, in his way. Flay-
ing on the harp and throwing javelins. I’ve
often thought I’d paint David —or is it Solo-
mon?—in his harem.”
“King David,” said Aunt Maria, “is not
the type of person nice people talk about.
Not in this house.”
And Aunt Theresa echoed: "Not in this
house.”
There was another silence which Tewks
tried to retrieve by announcing that he had
always been interested in things like that,
but he had not been allowed to go to Sun-
day-school, as he had never had complete
Sunday clothes, and that it had been the
sorrow of liis infant life, and still was.
Noting that the aunts melted at this a little,
he continued emphasising his desire for re-
generation, till, after twittering in Theresa’s
ear a moment, Maria announced that they
would devote that night to enlightening him
as well as lay in their unworthy ability.
They carried out their threat. He was
herded by himself into the drawing-room, put
through an interminable catechism, and then
shown the error of his ways. Century
shouldered century out of the way. Finally
the world ended. . . .And Tewks found it was
over. “No matter.” he thought as lie fell
into bed, “a whole day and night to-morrow,”
and then went to sleep.
The next day gave no chance of conver-
sation till, on the way back from church, he
managed to fall to the rear with Marjorie.
"I’ve never forgotten the day I saw you
in the street,” lie exclaimed rapturously.
“Haven’t you?” she said in a tone that
inferred she had.
“How could I forget you?” he cried. She
said nothing; so. endeavoring to accentuate
the romantic nature of his calling, a favo-
rite means of attracting feminine attention,
he went on: "It’s rather fine being an artist,
you know.”
“It seems rather dusty to me,” she re-
plied.
“Oh, that’s the attic,” he assured her.
“But I meant the freedom, high living and
plain thinking and all that. Now, just to
show you. Suppose we were all walking
along here naked, I wouldn’t notice any-
thing different; but you would, wouldn’t
you ?”
“Certainly I should,” she said, involun-
tarily glancing at the skinny aunts ahead.
“Well,” said Tewks triumphantly, "doesn’t
that prove how open-minded and fro- we
are?”
As she had nothing to say to this he con-
sidered it proved.
“Wine and laughter—they are our stand-
ards which we hoist on the ramparts of oui
freedom and fling in the faces of suburban
ites, like a new dawn of beauty, trampling
on the corpses of their lives. It’s a living
death, that’s what it is; and why does man
stand this tyranny of darkness? It’s be-
cause he can’t laugh.”
“Do you laugh very much, Mr. Tewks?"
she asked sweetly. “Because I haven’t heard
you!”
“How could I laugh here?” he said ex-
citedly. “Closed in by the black walls of
circumstance and the chains of convention,
how could I? I’m not saying anything
against your aunts, but do you want to
laugh when you look at them?”
“But what’s the good of your philosophy,”
she replied, “if it goes under like this before
hostility ?”
“I will laugh, then,” said Tewks. “But
can I see you later somewhere this after-
noon? I feel I can talk naturally to you.”
“Just how I feel,” she surprised him by
saying. “Meet me in that scrub tit the back
at 3 this afternoon.”
They were now tit the gate; he was un-
able to say more, but at lunch, to show her
what he could do, he cracked a few jokes
and laughed uproariously, thus destroying
the good effect he had so painfully created
on the aunts.
“Mr. Tewks, this is Sunday,” Maria re-
buked him. "Go outside if you must laugh;
not in this house.”
And Theresa added : "This is Sunday,” as
if she would produce an almanac if he were
to disagree.
However, he felt he had vindicated him-
self in Marjorie’s eyes. He fumed impa-
tiently till 3, and then with elaborate sec-
recy removed himself to the rear, where, she
joined him. They walked down a cow-track.
“You look a dryad or something,” said
Tewks.
“More like the something. I am sure,” she
replied.
“No. I feel I could paint a great picture
if I could only use you for it.” Tewks knew
by long experience that nothing touches a
woman like saying that you want to paint
her. “A man must centralise his emotions."
he continued. “I have been too prodigal
and wasteful —not
with money, I mean,
but emotions. It’s
awful to be a man
of strong passions.
Often I feel I will
throw my palette
aside and really live.
Wine, women and
laughter.”
‘‘At two and six-
pence a time, I sup-
pose?” she asked.
“You think I ex-
aggerate, then? I
admit we haven’t
much money our-
selves ; but some of
th e really rich
people, you know —
cars and champagne
and lobsters —come
to us when they
want the real thing.
When they’re tired
of cafes and hotels,
they say, ‘Let’s go
to the art-under-
world and have a
truly bacchanalian
time.’ ”
“Does Tom join in
all this?” she asked
sharply.
“Oh, no. Clinker's
very q uie t,” said
Tcvvks, thinking he
was robbing Clinker
of some of the glory
by disclaiming his
share in these imagi-
nary debauches, and
- adding it to himseli.
“There’s a little
gir 1, yo u know,
tiger type, Spanish
and black-eyed. She
dances like a demon.
We’ve had some jolly
good dances together,
real Apache things."
An d h e invented
what seemed to him
a few more glamor-
ous details about
himself calculated to
lire the fancy of any
repressed young
female.
In the midst of these she insisted on turn-
ing back, as she would be missed, she said.
To his solicitations that lie must have an-
other talk to her before she left, she told
him to open the first door on the left round
the corridor at 11 that night. It was her
room, but with his free mind lie would think
of such a trysting-place just as of any other.
'This seemed maddeningly promising, and
as they came near the end of the trees Tewks
asked for a kiss.
"Well?” she laughed.
He moved towards her, and, slipping on
a root, kissed her passionately on tin 1 ear.
Next moment lie was alone ; if, however, he
could have heard the recital she gave to
Clinker on her return, he might not have
felt so hilarious.
At 11 that night a piercing shriek rang
through the house, and Theresa, Marjorie
and Clinker, rushing into Maria’s room,
found her in an immense flannel nightgown
her hair in curling-papers, with the gibber-
ing Tewks before her trying to explain how
lie had walked into her bedroom as lie had.
It was a partial maniac that Clinker man-
aged to drag back to their room —a maniac
who kept him up almost all the night tell-
ing him how the girl had deceived him. A
rather unnecessary act. as Clinker ha* 1
planned the whole episode to avenge himself
on this intruder into his preserves.
Tewks left at dawn the next, day, and
spent an hour on the platform waiting for
an early train.
That afternoon O’Swivel. entering the bar
where Dora served, found Tewks leaning rp
against the counter, smiling and sipping a
sixpenny cocktail.
“How’s the soul?” lie asked.
“Ask Dora,” said Tewks enigmatically.
“There’s-no hope for the middle classes. She's
the only girl in the world for me.”

Sand.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
MORTON lazily sifted the warm sand
through his fingers. Where he lay
the dropping sun played full upon
him. The little path through the twisted ti-
tree was full of the white light that seemed
to spill into it from the dazzling track on
the water. Morton’s eyes were thoughtful.
He was staring fixedly at a yacht far out
on the smooth bay. Very deliberately, slow T-
moving as the hand of a clock, the little
boat crept towards the path of light. At
last it was on the bright edge of it, and
then, almost suddenly, was swallowed in the
glare and momentarily lost to sight.
As if released from a spell, Morton shifted
restlessly and turned his head to the quiet
figure that had come unnoticed to his side.
For a while he could see nothing blit a vague
blackness wavering through a ball of glaring
white, and the other had spoken before his
dazzled eyes recovered.
“So the giant does sometimes rest from
his labors!” drawled the mocking voice, and
went on gaily: “Well, John, my boy, you
look wondrous restful. But John, my ener-
getic John, why bust another illusion? If
there was one thing I knew for sure I’d see
when I came back to the ‘home of my child-
hood’ it was our brother John hard at work.
Loafing away the good hours of daylight!
What’s wrong with you? At the least, you
might be watching the wheat grow or listen-
ing to the uneasy stirrings of the tender
young potatoes. Fie on you, John; it’s
shocked me you have!”
John Morton smiled quiet recognition be-
fore he could well see the speaker. Slowly
the glare before his eyes dulled, and the
vague form took shape. It showed the set,
lumpy body of a middle-aged man and the
bright face of a boy. They were of an
age, these two, somewhere in the indefinite
forties; but there were lines about John
Morton’s mouth and a certain hardness of
the jaw, a tiredness in the eyes that were
lacking in the other. The whole face and
attitude of the standing man, despite the
heavy, middle-aged figure, spoke of confi-
dent, care-free, thoughtless, probably selfish
youth. There was a roving brightness in
his eyes, an easy sensuality in his lips ; his
forehead was smopth, his cheeks unhollowed.
Ilis florid complexion, thickened neck and
slightly jutting waistcoat all confessed to
lack of worry and lashings of good things
to eat and drink. The tone of his bantering
voice, every smooth gesture, told plainly that
the world had proved a very good oyster to
his opening.
The man on the ground reached up a
welcoming hand. “Good day to you, Dick,”
he said quietly. “So you’ve come back to
look the old place over again?”
• He had not seen this casual brother of
his in eight years, nor heard of him for five ;
but he was never a demonstrative man,
.John Morton. The other smiled and dropped
to the sand beside the sitting figure.
“And little change I find,'’ he said, “ex-
cept tli„t a certain hard-working brother o’
mine seems to have turned loafer. And the
good Lord knows that’s change enough!”
John Morton looked at the speaker for a
while in silence. The tired eyes showed a
mild, uninterested surprise at the obvious
signs of prosperity. And then he said, “The
world seems well with you, Dick.”
“Oh, yes,” answered the other compla-
cently, “things have come my way a bit
lately. The black sheep has lighted on
some fattening pastures; the rolling stone
seems hardly able to dodge the blessed moss.
Gomes as a shock, I suppose, to find the feck-
less, loose-living member of the family mak-
ing a success of things. John, boy, the
world’s fine! But what of my immortal
soul, you’d be asking, eh. John?”
The man beside him seemed to wince a
little under his raillery.
“It’s all right, John,” he went on. “I
won’t tread on your tender corns. Every
NO ESCAPE.
THE VISITOR: “Do you know if she'll he in
this evening?"
THE COOK-GENERAL : “Oh, yes; she’ll he in
this evenin’ orright. She’s got to he!
It’s my night out.”
man to Ms own madness! I’m the lost
sinner, and you’re the Lord’s anointed. You
can’t help being a good Christian, and I
can’t hope to be. So there we are.”
For a long time he kept up a lazy rattle
of talk about his life and adventurings since
the two had met. Many lands and many
men (and women) had he known. Strange
and colorful and full of peeping, forbidden
things were his words. For the most part
it was a carefully-edited tale, for he held
a real, if somewhat contemptuous, respect
for the goodness of his brother; but there
were times when a little demon of playful
malice seemed to sit in his eyes as he
twisted them to watch slyly the effect on this
unbending Puritan of some imprudent his-
tory. Somehow he could never resist for
long the temptation to tilt good-naturedly
at this silent man’s harsh Christianity. P
had always been so from his earliest memo-
ries of the good little boy and the bad little
boy of the family. But there were times,
too, when the very glamor of suddenly-
recalled romance ran again in his veins, and
without any calculation on his part colored
his words with rosy worldliness and hints
of flesh and devil. He stood confessed by
his speech a sinner who knew no repentance.
He was very much of the world, worldly.
\nd “the world's fine” were his own words.
John Morton said little. His eyes, nar-
rowed against the warm glare, were again
fixed far away on the barely-moving yacht
that was now well clear of the sun-track,
and looked in the distance like a piece ot
white paper blown against a blue wall. He
appeared to have returned to the reverie
from which he had been disturbed. His
words were strangely terse and irrelevant
when he snoke after a long silence.
“Dick,”‘he said, “I don’t suppose you
remember a night at old Adam’s orchard !
An Easter Saturday, was. We were nip-
pers of about 10 or so.” ,
“Adam’s!” exploded the other. _ What
the No, I’m hanged if Wait a bit,
though! O Lord, yes, I remember! You
tagged along the whole way telling me how
wicked it was to steal. You always were
a righteous cuss, John. And while I nipped
the apples, old Adam nipped you and gave
you a welting. But what on earth put that
in your head?” , T .
“X don’t know,” muttered John slowly;
“just happened to think of it.”
Dick Morton laughed happily. ’Virtue
never goes unrewarded, eh? And even that
didn’t cure you.”
He stood, stretched himself and brushed
the sand from his well-cut clothes. ‘ Here,
old man, you haven’t told me much about
yourself,” he said, characteristically over-
looking the fact that he had not sought the
information. “Still plodding the same old
track eh’ Breakfast and work and dinner
and bed And church three times on Sun-
day. The honest son of soil and toil! How s
the farm going?” „
“Not very well, Dick ; not too well. )f
“That’s bad, John. I’m sorry, old son.
But the words were careless, and a moment
later, whistling softly, he strolled down the
little path to the water’s edge, his outline
picked out and glorified by a border ol
wavering light. He stood with his hands
thrust deep in his pockets looking out over
the water. John Morton gazed at the con-
fident back and jauntily-set head. There
was an odd, confused, questioning look in
his eyes. And then, as if with an effort, he
turned them away and glared blankly down
at the sand that he still ran idly through his
fingers. It was smooth and warm and some-
how soothing to touch. He piled and moulded
small pyramids of it with extraordinary
care, and then thrust his hand richt through
the base of them and trickled the soft stun
slowly away. He buried the hand and kited
it steadily so as not to disturb the little
heap that remained on the back of it, and
radiated into five sharp ridges along the
stretched fingers. The pastime seemed to
engross him, but his eyes were almo~t un-
Se An* ant laboring over the rough surface
caught his attention. It was very small
and shone black in the sunlight. Its way
was slow and difficult, for it carried an
absurd burden. Morton could make out
what looked like the thorax and part of a
wing of some insect, a treasure of the hunt
that evidently was to be landed home at no
matter what‘weary effort, for the load was
bigger than the carrier, and the country
over which the ant struggled had been made
almost impassable by the long hills and hoi-
lows fashioned by Morton’s restless fingers.
The man watched the fight apparently with
interest. He seemed startled by the sudden
words flung over the shoulder of the figure
by the water.
' “Where’s young John, the sailor son, these
davs? Must be all of 18 now, I suppose?
There was an appreciable pause before
John Morton answered, and when the words
came they were a little slurred and rapid.
“■Seventeen,” he said. “He’s up in the
China Sea somewhere.” , , .
The question had evidently disturbed him,
but he slipped back into his former listless
state His eyes again fastened on the ant.
The glint of its black body seemed to hold
them as the attention of a hypnotic subject
is held by anv glittering thing. And over
and over again a phrase was echoing m Ins
head dazing him as the soft, repeated sug
gestiou of the hypnotist sways the subject.
“Virtue never goes unrewarded —never goes
unrewarded —never goes” It sang
through his brain with the exact inflection
of the bantering voice that had used it. H
swept through him in wave after wave ol
a sort of numbness, dulling his mind, merci-
fully dulling, too, the damnable ache that
seemed settled right at the centre of his
consciousness. His thoughts were becoming
confused. W hat had been the suggestion :
The sun was so warm in every fibre of him
as almost to rob him of the energy to think.
“Virtue never goes” Dorothy, perhaps
She was certainly the modest mistress ot all
virtue.
But at thought of her. despite the years
the dull ache became sudden agony, as if
someone twisted a knife that had rested
quietly in his side, as if a sudden
draught had fed a sleeping coal that
lay in his flesh. They had been so happy.
It had seemed to him at times that he was
almost guilty of the sin of idolatry, of for-
getting iiis jealous God in a new worship,
This was no trivial matter to John Morton.
There was no uncertainty or weakness in
the hard religion that had been bred in him.
It was a stern God, and hard and stern
were His commandments. There coum be
no straying. All flesh was weak, and all
ways beset with pitfalls. Heaven and Hell
and the Devil and his lost angels had always
been very real to him from the first teach-
ings of that fanatical old elder his father.
His was a harsh and literal creed, and he
had lived up to it. There had never been
any wavering in his life then or since. It
was a stern God.
But he and Dorothy had been so happy.
Just 12 short months of marriage, and then
the fruit of it and their longings and pray-
ers and plans for the coming life. There
was a living memory of that night of pain.
Pain had seemed to fill the house. Every
dark corner throbbed with it: hangings and
curtains drooped with it, and a little wind
sobbed in the wide, old chimney. Then came
the rustle of quick-moving feet and a flurry
of startled unrest. And. later, there was
a white face on a white pillow, a weak clutch
on his hand that gradually and pitifully
loosened, and the first protesting wail of
new life and a woman’s dying sigh strangely
mingled.
There had been no extravagant show of
grief, no wailing to the high heavens. These
things were ordained of the Great Wisdom,
and it ill-became man to deny their seemli-
ness. To Morton there was nothing false or
strained in the glib quoting of the old min-
ister, sombre and severe, “His will be done !”
But he had been somehow numbed and help-
less and indifferent as the long.weeks dragged
heavily by. He had labored so untiringly
during the last year. The _ son for whom
they prayed had been the inspiration and
end of it all. And in all its helplessness the
child had come, not as a hostage to happi-
“SHEW SUCH A WILD, WILD ROSE.”
ness, but as the ruthless slayer of it. Mor-
ton knew terror for moments of most un-
Christian hatred of his own child. It was
months later before his tortured mind be-
came wholly normal again, and by that time
his apathy had seen the destruction of the
fruits of long years of effort and slid him
back to the edge of ruin.
There was. no novelty in this. From his
earliest memories of the family settled on
the little farm it had always been a never-
resting fight to keep just ahead of the pur-
suing flood of adversity. To him now it,
seemed that his way through life had been
ever the roughest of roads through the low
places, marked by occasional little peaks of
near-prosperity that sank abruptly again to
the level of hopeless effort. There had been
the affair of Dick. A year after that young
rebel had run away from the uncongenial
home, news had filtered through of his sor-
did lapse and impending disgrace. Old man
Morton solemnly and theatrically cursed and
disowned this ungrateful son, quoting heav-
ily of serpents’ teeth and the like, and
crippled the farm to save him from gaol.
Five years of penury and soul-sapping
effort had brought them back to the point
of comparative success. Then had come the
sudden, surprising illness of the iron-seeming
old man. the long, expensive doctor-ridden
months that led to his death, and the 20-
year-old John faced life again from the be-
ginning of the stony road. He added to his
burden by making good to the ne’er-do-well
Dick in painfully-gathered money the share
that old Morton had denied him of his heri-
tage. Six years more, and John again
struggled to seeming security. Followed
with tragic abruptness Dorothy and world-
illuminating happiness, and what had seemed
the end of all things. It was long after that
before he gathered himself once more for
the fight. But at last he was able to lay
to his soul that peculiar, happy anodyne of
the completely religious, and he found him-
self more and more driven by an ever-grow-
ing love for this baby son that had so cruelly
used him. It had been a harder struggle
this time. He felt vaguely tired. But his
love for the son he had hated became a most
effective spur.
It had seemed somehow wrong when the
15-year-old bov begged leave to forsake the
farm and find ‘his own life. This leave, after
much thought and prayer, was refused;
but after a year of increasing discomfort
between the two the history of the brother
was repeated in the son, and young John
disappeared. He had written regularly to
the lonely, ageing man on the farm, and found
for himself the sea life he craved.
Things had gone badly with John Morton
after that. He seemed suddenly old and
increasingly tired. His indifferent answer
to Dick’s indifferent question had concealed
a very real crisis. The farm was certainly
going “not very well.” He felt somehow
that he could not have explained to this
debonair brother just how badly it was
going. Even less had he been able to face
that conventional, careless query about
“young John, the sailor-son.” What was it
he had answered? “Up in the China Sea
somewhere.” . That was right enough. Ilis
hand fumbled at his breast-pocket. The
crackling envelope was still there. He had
carried the telegram with him for two days
now. Not that he needed to read it again.
He could see the words without effort. Some-
one regretted to inform him that his son,
John Morton, of the steamship Town of
Delhi, had been lost overboard during
cvclonic weather in the China Sea —some-
where No, of course, that last word was
not in the telegram. That was what he
had said —“Up in the China Sea some-
where.” But how could he have said any-
thing different to this careless, quizzical
brother of his?
Was it thee that Dick had spoken of
virtue never going unrewarded? No, there
was something else that had Yes now
he remembered. “Virtue never While I
nipped the apples old Adam nipped you -
You always were a righteous cuss.” It
seemed to him now that life had always
treated him so. .
The jumbling, burning whirl of thoughts
was suddenly halted by a gay cry from the
man on the beach.
“I say, John, I’m going along to have a
look at that little cave of ours. Be back in
a minute, old man.”
He started as if someone had dashed cold
water in his face. His aching mind was
quickly blank, and he stared stupidly after
the disappearing figure. Then his nead
drooped. It was throbbing painfully. He
must stop this eternal round of thinking,
thinking, or he felt he should go mad. The
crowding thoughts could not have held him
for long, for liis eyes fell on the ant he had
been watching before. It had not gone far
and still clung to its unfair burden. He
stared at it for a while incuriously. It
had come to a more even patch of sand,
and was moving a little more quickly, ©till,
it was heavy going with that overpowering
load. , „ , ,
What a stubborn, plucky little beggar it
was, with its polished black body and fragile
legs ! John Morton leaned over to look at
it more closely. Then, carelessly, he dug two
fingers deep in the sand immediately in front
of it and scooped backwards, and the ant
fell blindly into the pit. Even then it did
not lose hold of the prize it carried. W itn-
out pause it began to scramble up the crumb-
ling side of the abyss into which it hau
dropped. It looked absurdly like a little
black man butting along one of those tre-
mendous pushballs. It fell back time ana
again from the steep ascent. Once it hau
all but reached the rim, when the treacher-
ous sand collaosed beneath it, and it slith-
ered to the bottom. At last it was clear
and away.
The man watched it for a while, and
again dug a pit right before its blind pro-
gress, and again the struggle was to do. He
seemed to become more and more interested
as the game ivent on. He dragged himself
some distance over the sand to be nearer
to it. He moulded the sides of his pits to
make them more steep; he even tried to
fashion little, overhanging ledges near the
top. He took to preparing, right against the
wall of the old trap up which the ant was
fighting, a new one with only the narrowest
of ridges between, so that the struggling crea-
ture blundered directly from one to the next.
Then he let it go free for a full 18 inches.
Minute after minute the queer sport con-
tinued. The hardy little fighter was show-
ing signs of distress. More often now it
dropped its treasure in the slithering fall,
only to retrieve it before tearing with fran-
tically-working legs at the inexplicable,
treacherous cliffs that faced it. Finally the
precious burden was abandoned, and the
ant struggled on alone, and more and more
slowly. This last ascent was the worst or
all, for the man had built right around the
edge a small mountain of stuff that lifteu
it far above the ordinary level. Then as
the tired climber reached the top, he poured
from his cupned hand a stream of sand that
hurtled it back and buried it under a smother-
ing mass. A half-dozen times, as the little
black head and feebly-waving antennse ap-
peared, the same destructive flood over-
whelmed it, and at last it was a full minute
before it fought its way through.
John Morton smoothed back the sand until
the ant was clear. His face was sombre
: and brooding. Suddenly his thin bps
straightened to a line, his eyes glowed, his
whole face twisted queerly as he picked the
ant between thumb and finger, and crushed
. it there.
i His brother, who had come quietly to his
side, halted in surprise.
“What the —what’s the game?” he stam-
mered. u
John Morton laughed unpleasantly.
: most amusing little game. Dick,” he said
• softly—“playing at being Hod.”
s There was a moment of shocked silence.
' Then John Morton’s eyes dulled n nd way-
■ ered. A little shiver ran over him. Hr
- whole body seemed to shrink, and “God for-
give me!” he muttered.

Christmas Eve.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OSQUITOES in the nets with battle-
A pawpaw branch that scraped along
a wall.
And then I heard the sudden strike of hoofs;
And on the window square there seemed to
fall
The shadow of a. woman, riding high
Her chosen steed across a midnight sky.
So white she was. The deer she rode was
black —
An antlered stag Avith fierce and flaming
eyes.
Too wild a thing, I thought, for Fairyland.
But underneath the misty autumn skies
One could have guessed him battling for
his doe
Or struggling for his life, caught in the floe
At breaking winter, while across the green
Of ice and guiding tides a far-off seal
Bellowed uneasily ; and where a spar
Showed-drifting wreck, or on a shattered
keel
A hand gripped, frozen, while the dead man
swung
In the deep current when the spring tides
flung
A waking movement through the fields of ice.
She was a lovely woman, white as death,
Yet warm as life. She rode her great black
stag
In polished nakedness. It seemed a breath
Of light peach-blossom summer held her still,
And w-antoned with her long bright hair at
will.
Strange vision for a sultry Christmas Eve,
With scent of gum-trees blowing to the
town,
And, here and there, the litter pageant
leaves —
A burst balloon, a riband from a gown,
A little glove stained dark with crimson wine
From the hot palm that lately clung to mine !
From some dance-dream I woke; and o’er
the sill
Of my blank window saw new pageant
pass—
Titania with her hair in moth-wings bound,
And sleepy Bottom chewing stems of
grass;
And Puck who wore, in dreamland’s curi-
ous hap.
Three peaked poinsettia leaves to make his
cap!
Old world and new were jumbled in my
trance.
What product did that jar of Minos hide?
Sweet oil or robbers ? Was that purple robe
Too heavy for the maidenhood inside?
A century of golden moons it bore,
And that pale string of pearls would sweep
the floor!
Surely she had been happier could she, too,
Have ridden her black stag beneath the
stars,
Veilless, to meet her lover, careless of
Tall latticed windows and the hundred bars
Of the Forbidden ; where the eunuchs stood
Guarding a sacred thing for passion’s food.
Zobeide ! All jewels, unguents, veils !
They must have choked life’s budding,
parched its bloom,
Until at last you crept away to sleep—-
A little tired woman in a tomb.
Yet even when you sleep, grim custom smiles
To hold you couched beneath a thousand
tiles !
But she who rode the black stag, when sho
died,
I know she went out like a moth, a flower.
Somewhere the poppy blazes in her hair.
Her honey mouth could hold the bee an
hour ;
And in the rose and lily of her breasts
Free birds of burnished plumage make their
nests.
No man can make sarcophagus for her,
And roof it over with the tower and tile!
The sunset ranges hold her length of limb,
A wild red dawning somewhere keeps her
smile—
Zobeide might envy her, so fair
Is her pearl throat among the floating hair!
Far down the street a taxi rushes by,
A drunken man sways to a rising kerb,
There is a scent of cassia in my room,
And the slow smoke of some forgotten herb
As copper-colored Pharaoh turns to peer
At memories of jugs of barley beer
Or palm wine in emblazoned bottles set.
Even a Pharaoh’s legs might chance to
stray
And need the succor of a faithful slave;
For king and slave unite at holiday,
Though one in jewelled vesture reels along,
And one goes bare above his short sarong.
A blank again my window grows. I see
Two rival cats at issue on the tiles ;
And now a dancing-girl with orange wreaths
Hides clogging poisons in her amorous
wiles.
Her muslins are like moonlight on the sea,
Her moving limbs a wave of mystery!
Now mild-eyed Hathor, horned, with hide of
dun.
Seems to rebuke her, stepping sure and
slow—•
The everlasting mother. Then I hear
The farmers’ carts churn through the
streets below;
A wind of morning blows all dreams away,
A yawning world wakes to its Christmas
Day !
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
Santa Claus.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was in a Melbourne suburb one blister-
ing Christmas Eve that I first saw him.
The electric trams along Sydney-road
had stopped, and I was waiting in the depot
for a re-start lie was the Santa Claus of
“Carnival” —“Ye gay carnival. .. .at less
than city prices.” Otherwise a fancy-goods
shop across the street. The place bristled
with Christmas “lines” and seasonable
“novelties,” and was decorated with baskets
of bears and kewpies and falling snow made
of wadding.
All day a hurricane from the north had
been blowing—one of those summer visita-
tions which so often cause Sydney-road to
be likened to Hades. Tearing away city-
wards, whirls of dust, hats and wastepaper,
the scorcher made of “Carnival” and its sur-
roundings a desolation. Santa Claus, rav-
aged by anxiety as well as by the gale, now
breasting it, now bent before it, in dismal
ploddings up and down, awaited the rush
of buyers who did not come.
I pitied the man: 98° in the shade is
bad enough in cotton slacks, but swaddled
in red flannel and wadding! I tried
to gauge the approximate weight of his
rigout—flannel robe, voluminous breeches
and sleeves, and a hood, baggy behind yet
tightly sealed to the face in front; all of
red flannel, lined with the moulting fur of
white rabbits. Besides this, he was strangled
amidships by a belt and bells, while rabbit-
leather leggings hung round his shanks, anu
over his boots were drawn white slippers
composed of other dead bunnies’ remains,
though why he should be double-shod only
the historian could possibly say. And let
me not forget his beard, a magnificent affair
pendant from his cheekbones and flooding
his person in a torrent of horsehair. Poor
devil! Sealed up like that in a red bag,
no wonder he sagged !
Business seemed at a standstill. Nothing
was doing, though he did his best to attract
trade by bumping into any citizen afoot, and
then, with fulsome and false gaiety, offering
the season’s compliments, along with a ticket,
price sixpence, entitling the buyer to a
“gift” from a Christmas-tree growing in
a tub. If the ticket and the coin changed
hands the shop’s proprietor looked less
threatening, and Santa himself less anxious.
THE OPTIMISTIC PESSIMIST.
“It's hard luck: but you, never agree with me on anything."
“Just as -well. If I did we'd both be wrong.”
Intercepting his dismal treadmill, I bought
one of the nassports to the tree. Surprise
at anyone voluntarily parting with a sprat
seemed to stun him. I was the first to do
so, it appeared. “Never saw such a hungry
place,” he confided; “the public don’t seem
to have the price of a bootlace on ’em.”
“Business bad, then?” I hazarded.
“Rotten!” he ejaculated, and started to
massage his features.
I wondered why. “Pain in your jaw?”
I questioned. “Or toothache?”
“Stricture,” he answered curtly.
But presently, when the massage had taken
effect and his facial muscles had unwound
from the spirals of gaiety which were part
of his outfit, he became less taciturn. “Yes,
stricture; me face ain’t so pliable as it used
to be. Joints are getting too stiff for Christ-
mas guff; an’ having to grin, and keep on
grinning, plays up with ’em. As for busi-
ness, seems like a curse has descended on
the legitimate Christmas trade. Only people
takin’ money are the pubs and the poultry.”
Here he spat gloomily. “As fer my firm” —
he contemptuously indicated his headquarters
—“they haven’t taken a fiver all day.”
Together we surveyed the window of “Car-
nival,” full of the season’s rubbish. “Car-
nival ! Carnival!” he commented, with a
sardonic grunt. “If this is a carnival I’ll
work in a boneyard. Huh!” (Here he
sighed and wriggled miserably.) “Sweat’s
running down my back like a mob o’ centi-
pedes,” he grumbled. (Here he lifted his
beard as a knight might have raised his
visor, and drew an untrammelled breath.)
“This beard, too,” he complained. “Ugh!
Suffocating! D’you smell it?”
I had smelt it. It gave off mixed odors
like ants, burning eggshells, and goats. One
could not really ignore a perfume so poig-
nant.
“Anyhow, I’ve done me dash as the Christ-
mas Daddy,” he continued. “Can’t stand
the weight of the rigout now. I’m not the
man I was.”
“You’ve acted the part before, then?” I
murmured.
“Too right I have,” said he. “Been hold-
ing down th’ job all over the city for the
last 15 years. Very good at th’ game —once.
One of the profesh, as you might say. Used
to come in for very flattering criticisms, too
—got a pile of press cuttings at home. ‘Ex-
cellent portrayal,’ one says. It’s gratifying,
very gratifying.”
“Yes,” I agreed, “if you like the work.”
But he hastened to set me right there.
“No, no ; I don’t like it. It’s just chance.
Dunno ’ow it is, but I always find myself
out of a job in December, an’ glad to take
anything.”
Suddenly his cracking face-muscles were
again contorted in false mirth. He left me.
A group of little girls had approached the
shop-window. He pounced upon them,
blithely proffering his tickets, indicating the
dolls and kewpies. The girls shied and
passed on. Others glanced at the display
with blase eyes.
My friend chucked a boy under the chin,
and, with unction, told of a “model motor”
inside. The boy was wary. He put posers
concerning carburetters and gears, and “Was
it an old Ford?” From answers received he
decided that it must be, and, therefore, not
worth a sixpence.
“Y’see how it is,” sighed Santa Claus dis-
spiritedly as the younger set departed.
“Supercilious young blighters—nothing but
a Rolls-Royce will do ’em. No, there’s no-
thing in the game nowadays. It’s this edu-
cation. Th’ kids know too much —no use
coming at any of ’em past the perambulator
age. They see through me, an’ it hurts.”
He dropped a tear —or it may have been
a bead of perspiration. I saw that he was
pocketless—which was natural in a real
Father Christmas. But he winked away the
tear successfully.
“Well, my little man!” He bent with
paternal spontaneity over another window-
gazer. “And what is Daddy Christmas
bringing you this year, eh?”
“Nothing,” replied the laconic youngster.
“Me father’s out o’ work.” “So’s mine,”
supplemented another; “we got to wait till
the after-the-Christmas sales, me mother
said.”
Meanwhile the north wind tore at every-
thing, blinding the eyes and filling the ears
with grit, lifting hats and flapping old Santa’s
bags around his legs till he staggered. The
street was now practically empty; all that
could be seen of the buying public were legs
struggling beneath open umbrellas, or figures,
bent like boomerangs, running before the gale.
Never was such a day. And, to make mat-
ters worse, “Carnival” was isolated from
neighboring shops through the “wrecking” of
old buildings on either side. It took some
nerve to enter this zone of brickbats and
lime, and those navigators who braved it
seemed of a soured and penurious mind, im-
pervious to Christmas sentiment and abso-
lutely callous to the flirt of sixpenny tickets.
Santa, smirking in the faces of irritated
housewives, bestowing paternal pats on the
head of childhood, and doing his level best
to keep the cash-register busy, was a sight
for sympathy. “Might’s well throw in me
bundle, I reckon,” he confided. “Absolutely
the hungriest Christmas Eve I ever struck.
Fair fed up with it. An’ if you only knew
how sick I am of looking at that kewpie—l
could smash the blamed thing.” He turned
away from a malevolent-looking celluloid mon-
ster'that held pride of place in the window,
brushed dust and rabbits’ hair from his nos-
trils, and muttered imprecations.
“Could you stop one?” I whispered.
“Stop one!” He thrilled ecstatically.
“Too right I could —if it will go through
this infernal thing,” indicating the section
of horsehair which formed his beard. “My
jaw feels as though it needed oiling.”
Stealthily we crept away. He “stopped” a
couple while he was about it, and now be-
came reminiscent. “Some actor” he had
been in the past, quick to seize upon the
novel and the-bold. “I’ve seen me riding
down Bourke-street with a sleigh-load of
toys drawn by a team of dogs, bells all
a-jingle and cracking me whip an’ winking
at the girls. Convincing? My Colonial!
An’ I ’ad ’eart in the part—put me person-
ality into it, as ye might say. As for the
public—well, well! We was more childlike
them days. The dear old public used to pay
tram-fares to see me pass.” He visualised
for me arrivals by stage-coach, by bullock-
waggon, train and tandem. A great variety
of vehicles there had been; but he, the spirit
of rite, had been changeless as Doom.
He sniffed and looked pathetically dry
again. I saw that “oiling up” was becom-
ing a habit, but I led the way, and again
he got the liquid past his whiskers.
“Yes, king of the kids I was, an’ I revelled
in giving joy to the little ones. But that’s
paper-talk,” he hastened to explain. ‘ Things
was dead easy then, before the big city
emporiums got their maulers on to every-
thing. Reg’lar octopuses some o’ them are
now, and ruining all smaller enterprises.
Octopuses—hold on, is that grammar?”
It was a subtle point. We left it, and I
produced another oil. After which the Bast
unrolled itself like a picture-reel, and he told
me of the Christmas he fell from a balloon
right into the ironmongery department of an
incipient octopus, as the running of such a
department plainly showed it to be—“be-
cause the genuine toy-shop was a toy-shop
then,” he explained; “they didn’t stock
fenders and crosscut-saws. Consequence
was, a busted face an’ a busted billet. Yes,
blime, and one year 1 rode in a papier-
mache train, handing gifts from the funnel
to the little ones—but that’s paper-talk
again. Well, well —times are changed. We
didn’t have such rotten weather, for one
thing.”
The Past now became invested with the
glamor of Romance, because of a sometime
nice girl who was threaded into the narra-
tive. “It was at Sellum’s,” lie said. “We
had a bedroom scene, with kids hired to
sleep in Cuddletown cots on Sleepwell mat-
tresses, and the nice girl would come in,
turn down the white night light and kiss the
kids good-night. My word, she was some
sliiela. . . .But where was I? Oh, yes! She’d
turn down the night light white —mean to
shay, th’ light night white —give them their
goo’-ni’ kiss an’.... an’ then she’d come be-
hind the scene an’ pass me one as well. Kind
of cheerio, y’ know. Camaraderie, an’ all
that. An’ then somebody ’d play ‘Good
King Wenselas,’ very soft, on a stock piano,
an’ I’d drop down the chimney with me bag
an’ fill the kids’ stockings. Too right, it
took. Rounds an’ rounds of applause;
enough to give anyone a swelled ’ead. As
for the girl—well, we took to kissing quite
openly, an’ the public seemed to enjoy it as
much as ice did. That was the programme
all Christmas week, and we took big money
till, one day, a nail left in the chimney
caught me beard an’ tore it off, an’ I came
on the scene clean-shaved. Th’ young
blighters in the beds starts giggling, an’ that
spreads to th’ public, an’ the whole thing’s a
blanky fiasker. I reckon that stunt marked
an epoch in the decay of Father Christmas,”
he ruminated. “If you look back, it was
about that -time the motor-trade come in.
That spoiled the kids. They’re done with
imag’ry and the world of faery—where did
I read that, I wonder. No matter, it’s only
more paper-talk. What the small fry want
now is hard-boiled fact, an’ down with tra-
dition.... Thanks, an’ then I must get
away.”
We slid back again. Only the wind was
stirring and it beat old Santa’s robe against
his unsteady legs and even made the pave-
ment heave beneath our feet.
Presently from my sheltered seat in the
depot I was astonished to note that a
frenzy of business had set in across the
road. “Carnival” was having spasms.
People—/‘the public”—had discovered it.
They came at first singly, then in twos, next
in clusters. In no time the pavement seemed
massed with them. Business was booming.
Something had metamorphosed Santa. He
drew customers as a magnet draws needles.
He hustled and bullied and became a super-
Santa Claus. No hypercritical public
cavilling now as to values! He didn’t allow
time for that, but with absolute genius shep-
herded the sheep inside, and there, I hope,
fleeced them.
And gaiety everywhere! Happy-looking
children hummed in and out. Someone lib-
erated fireworks, while gay balloons floated
from the interior, to be caught by the over-
flow outside. There was a scent of burning
incense, and wild excitement 'everywhere.
Santa darted hither and thither, showing
everyone how to buy and whom to buy for.
“Carnival” had come into its own and was
Carnival indeed.
And then Bangs, the Mayor, and his lady
approached. Like a hawk Santa wheeled
round them, and, behold! Bangs, dignified,
yet sheepish, was seen in the very heart of
“Carnival” —astride a rocking-horse ! Bis
bandy legs fitted the animal to a nicety, and
some confreres who had followed him in
were bent double with collegiate mirth.
Bangs was soon out again, bulging with
parcels and carrying, among other oddments,
the very kewpie that had harassed poor
Santa since dawn.
I tried to rise, but my feet seemed like
anchors. I tried to shout “Brava! Brava!
Well done!”- but my voice was that of a frog
in a mud-puddle and, like the frog, I was
very cold.
When I woke Melbourne’s weather had
changed again. What had been a furnace
was now a blizzard, with rain, rain, rain.
“Carnival,” I saw, had given up the ghost.
Squally sleet flooded its doorway, and within
it stood Santa Claus, a picture of despond-
ency. He had parted his magnificent beard
in twain and wound it round his neck as a
comforter. With murderous eyes he was
staring at the obese kewpie which still leer-
ingly courted annihilation at his hands.
“Could he keep another down?” I won-
dered. But no, for —Mng-a-ling-a-ling—
thank Heaven, the trams' are running at
last!
But —how did that kewpie get back into
the window"? To this day it remains one of
the great mysteries of my life whether there
really was such a person as Bangs the Mayor.

Unwooed.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
■il t ONESTLY, no man outside the
? "j family has ever kissed me, nor
* shown the slightest desire to.
And yet I am not altogether unpleasing,
am I?”
The little laugh that followed the words
held untold depths of mockery. He looked
at her, felt it good to be near her ; her radi-
ant womanhood uplifted him, though there
was nothing alluring in her beauty, and she
made no attempt to conceal her 40 years.
“Give me another cigarette, please—some-
times it is so inspiring to indulge. You see,
when I go back I shall not only have to
give up smoking, I shall have to hold up
hands of horror at all women who smoke.”
She laughed again.
In his chair beside her he moved a trifle
uneasily—perhaps he bent more towards her.
He was 1 stirred. His eye was upon the
fringe of dark-leaved trees between them
and the water, as though he had thrown his
mind out there and was now looking to see
what it made of this woman. The night was
a velvet pall studded with stars above and
lights below; music within the house, no
sound without.
Now when he looked at her he admired
her, told himself she must have been a re-
markably handsome girl. “How can this
be?” said he.
Her grey eyes flashed with merriment—
merriment heightened with tragic truth ; hers
were the eyes of a woman who has suffered
pain and disappointment, but has still heart
to laugh.
“You mean, how can I bring myself to
tell you such a thing?”
“No, not that. Confidences are good for
the soul. But how could the men of your
day have been so—so —well, so backward?”
“How can I say? Evidently they never
saw me.”
Perhaps for one fleeting moment he had
his doubts. She was handsome still, she was
intelligent; as a girl she must have been
far above the average.
“Perhaps the young men of your day were
blind.”
“Would that excuse them?”
“Dear life, no! Their taste must have
been pitifully poor.”
“Looking back on them across a space of
15 years or more, I think so, too,” and she
put out a hand for another cigarette—she
THE ALIBI.
BOSS: “Im told you have been flirting with the typist?”
CLERK : “Er — yes — er—I'm — er”
BOSS: “ That's all right. What I want to say to you is pay special
attention to her while my wife is about."
had ruined the last in a too tense pressure
of finger and thumb. “You see, when I re-
turn I shall have to give up all this sort
of thing—-ah, you men don’t know what
self-restraint is. Be a woman for five min-
utes ! Learn!”
“I think I am learning,” lie protested
teebly. “Did you spend your youth in a
convent?”
“Almost. The daughter of a semi-subur-
ban, semi-country rectory. No means. No
Friends. Church work, ungraced by the
three graces. Life mapped out for qne from
the First Sunday in Advent to the Tvventy-
fifth Sunday after Trinity. So year after
year.”
“But there must have been young men
in the parish?”
“There were —quite nice, some of them.
They married; they never even looked at
me. They snapped up all my girl friends,
leaving me high and dry. i saw all the
dancing, scheming, babbling, out-to-conquer
girls pass before my eyes and over my head.
Every year some of them went—till I alone
was left. I did much fine sewing for those
brides; I screwed out of my scant dress-
money to buy them wedding presents, tell-
ing myself each time that I was casting my
bread upon the waters. Ah, I cast quite
a lot upon the waters. But nothing floated
back to me.”
Her hand was resting on the arm ot the
chair nearest him. He put his own out
uncertainly, touched her fingers, withdrew
his hand; then, more deliberately gaining
courage, as it were, pressed his hand upon
hers. She allowed it to rema’n.
“Not fair, not fair!” he said earnestly.
“It does not seem fair,” she admitted.
EN SUITE.
THE GAY DOG : “There's Mrs. Justwed. She docs dress neatly—always favors plain
things, doesn't she?”
THE FLASH CAT : “Yes —look at her husband.”
“As we grow older we usually see some rea-
son for the disappointments of our Vobth,
but I see no reason for mine. I would have
made as good a mother as any of those who
were chosen before me—i do not hesitate to
declare it. I know it. I could prove it.
But” —her voice rolled down into its little
laugh of mockery—“evidently, in our parish,
there were not men enough to go round.
And I was the odd girl.”
He leaned a little closer. “Perhaps it is
not too late,” he murmured.
“Let’s go in,” she said quickly.
He accompanied her politely, obediently;
and most desperately was he puzzled.
* * * *
It was past midnight when he ran lip the
steps to his own door, and was turning his
latchkey before he noticed a white figure
crouching by a pillar of the porch, face up-
turned to a crescent moon. Slowly, amazedly
he bent toward it.
With one sure movement she was on her
feet and had clasped him about the neck,
“Why, Taffy, Taffy, what is this?”
She breathed her information into hiS bar.
“I could not sleep. I saw the lUobn rise.
to 1 thbught I
Would just come
out to —to —think
about it.”
“Think about it?
Think about the
moon?”
“No, no! Billy 1“
He carried net
into the house. She
was so lightly clad
that he could feel
the bones of bet
scraggy little per-
son.
“Well, you don’t
need to sit at Hiicl-
night on the ftoat
Steps to do yotir
thinking, do you?”
“For some kind
of thinking you
do,” she told him.
“You need a moon
and a few stars.”
“But what for?”
cried the stupid
man.
“Well, ybu see,
daddy, it’ll happen
some day. He’ll
come when there is
a moon, and the
garden is very still.
Even the birds
asleep. And he’ll
come riding into
the garden because
he will guess he
will find me there.
And he will say,
‘Oh, fairest!’”....
“No you don’t,”
he interrupted. “I
don’t want to hear
what he’ll say.”
He carried her to her little blue room, put
her back into her bed., sensed vaguely the
things that she must be missing; wished he
could do more for her, knew that there must
be hundreds of things that he could never do.
Then he went to his own heavily-furnished
but strangely empty room.
He was a widower —a decent widower
surely, for he had been “single” for six long
years. Now, during the process of undress-
ing, he endeavored to smooth a troubled
mind. After all, two incomprehensible
females in one night are a big order for
any man. Then, through the disorder, came
the startling inspiration. Dare he? Dare
he? In one act he could offer Miss Gallenge
some compensation for a wasted womanhood
and provide Taffy with a mother. It seemed
good. Of course, there was his freedom:
but, then, freedom is not everything.
Anyway, he slept upon it —deep, un-
troubled sleep.
A few days later they met again. Their
friends had arranged a picnic. Again it
seemed but the merest chance that, they
found themselves together. A secluded spot
by a noisy creek, her eyes following the
trouble of the water with a bright trouble
of their own. He thought this a good oppor-
tunity to speak about Taffy. He worked to
it cautiously. He spoke first of his wife,
recalled some trifling anecdote that began,
“Just before my wife died.”
“Dead? Your wife is dead!”
Her tone of surprise seemed faintlv to
displease him. So she hastened to add in a
softer voice : “I am sorry. From something
you said I pictured her extremely delicate,
almost an invalid.”
“Strange!” he murmured.
“Not at all,” shb hSslired him, “It speaks
worlds for your fidelity. Evidently her influ-
ence is still with you.”
Mollified, he thought it the right moment
to speak of Taffy,
“A daughter, tob ! Toff lufcky, lucky man !”
The lucky man lhade a small movement
with his hand. For a- moment he was at a
loss, Then she said qnickiy:
“You must show me Taffy,”
The meeting took place the next after-
noon, Taffy Was snatched from the rather
lifeless and sbmbre young. Woinah who was
“bringing her up”; ahd she and Miss Gal-
lenge went off to a phiet corner of the
garden. , When Taffy was eagerly ques-
tioned that 'evening by bet father, her vet-
diet was that MisS GdllSnge. whs the dearest
dear, and that they had had a beautiful
afternoon.
During, the next fortnight the two saw
a great deal Of each Other. Taffy gibwed
with vigor and life refreshed, and Miss
Gallenge regained some of her lost youth-
fulness.
One day they had tea together in the
garden. An autumn afternoon full of the
mystery of still sunshine and a brooding,
waiting earth. Taffy was young enough to
feel the mystery of the day and season, young
enough to feel —-yearningly, perhaps—that this
calm waiting was but a prelude to the living
. that, was to eom@.
. With di@r, head On Miss shouidfeT
Shb said, “Tell me, tell inb, dear, just how
it doeS hffppfen.”
“How dobs whut happen, Taffy?”
“Oh, yoU knOw. How he comes. What
he SayS When he does comb —you know!”
“Oh, comb, Taffy !”
“Don’t piit me off iliis time, dear. Just
tell me, Ybit must think about yourself
sometimes, and the things that are gding to
happen tb ybUlself. Oh, it must be just
heavenly to be grown up, always dressed
up and waiting, waiting for all the young
men to come along and tell you that you are
the angel Of their hearts.”
MisS Gallenge was stern. “Silly nonsense !
What have you been reading?”
“I don’t bother to read. I make up. It’s
heaps nicer.”
“With yourself as herbine! YUu silly
child.’’
“But you did it.” The shot went hoiiie
like a dart.
To have been quite honest, Miss Gallenge
should have answered: “Yes, I did; and
led myself to expect so much that I ruined
my own happiness.” But for Taffy’s good
she lied.
“Nonsense! I never thought about such
things till I was a woman grown.”
“Well, and when you were a woman grown
how did it all happen? Just what does it
feel like when the first man comes along and
tells you that he loves you? Perhaps there
was never a first one, because they came
three and four at a time—oh, lam sure they
came six at a time!”
Miss Gallenge sighed and resigned herself
to it. “Seven,” said she, flinging herself
into the sport. “Seven is a perfect number,
Therefore t a perfect number of perfect young
men, having heard of my charms in their
own far countries, came riding to my door
to pay their respects. With their hands upon
their hearts they offered me anything I
might like to name, even unto half the
kingdom.”
“And which one did you choose?” the listener
interrupted eagerly.-
“Choose?” Miss Gallenge looked across
the garden, and suddenly realised that imagi-
nation had given place to cruel actuality.
“You could not marry all the seven.”
“Of course not!”
“Then, what was there about the one you
chose to make you choose him?”
A little cloud passed over the garden.
There was a rustle in the bushes behind them
■ —a sudden, swift change on Miss Gallenge’s
face ;in her manner, in her voice. She leaned
over the child and whispered in her ear:
“Taffy, in real life, it’s never the girls
that do the choosing. It’s the men. Now.
run away—run away to the other side of
the garden, and don’t come back till I call
you.”
Miss Gallenge sat on and gazed unseeingiy
before her with eyes that smarted with tears
Unshed. Then swiftly the tears came —the
proud, confident head bowmd before a storm
of grief, and she wept, wept as the memory
of her girlhood’s dreams overwhelmed her
with a sense of crushing disappointment.
Dreams ! Girlhood’s dreams ! No doubt
they had been foolish, but they were girl-
hood’s excusable dreams.
A movement in the thicket behind; then
his voice. “You have no right to be crying
like this.”
She mastered herself, wiped her eyes. He
smiled before her, confident, serene.
“No right to be crying like this!”
“No-—o,” she confessed weakly. “I have
no right.”
“You are lonely—you have had a rotten
deal.” He bent to her. “Can I help you?”
She seemed to hesitate. He opened his
arms; she threw herself into them. With
the vehement passion that sometimes is
granted to middle-age he clasped her to him,
giving her the kisses that life had denied.
“Now—now we can talk,” he said.
She struggled slightly so that he felt con-
strained to release her.
“There is nothing we can talk about.”
“Nonsense!”
She stood erect, and even with the tears
on her face she looked strangely triumphant.
“You are right. I should not have been
crying—they were not honest tears.”
“You mean that yoli will not marry me?”
Sadly she shook her head. “Too late,
Had you asked 10 years ago”— : glie broke into
the little mocking laugh he had heard before.
He was amazed, he was hurt | he coaxed a
little, spoke touchingly of Taffy ; he almost
Stormed. Theh she broke iff;
“Forgive ine if I yOU. I assure
you I waS thrilled —thrilled! It’s been an
experience, you see. I’m afraid I worked
for it; but my life has been So narrow, so
flobr —and I have to go back to it. Oh, you
can have no idea of the narrow life I go back
to! And those kisses of yours—you can’t
begrudge me them. They have made me
feel that contemporary manhood has at last
paid its respects to me; the memory of them
will warm the years that are to come.”

The house had a bow-window and a mean
verandah, and was one of a dozen such
houses in a narrow street. The dining-
room—between the drawing-room and the
kitchen —was a tiny room with a fiat window
that looked on to a paling-fence and the top
pane Of the dining-room window next door.
It whs the night father came home late, and
the childi-eh had had tea in the kitchen, and
now gathered round the handful of coals that
burned in the dining-room grate. The child-

In her youth, as she had herself

She had been beautiful, charming and healthy
—but the knights rode by. They had eyes,
they had ears, they had senses; but they
all rode by. In her late twenties she mar-
ried Richard Kendell, not because he loved
her Or because she loved him, but because
he asked her; Richard was ponderous, some-
thing df a seholar, and he was a clerk in
the Civil Service. Thereafter the life of
neither could be called eventful —hers might
have been eventful only in its pangs. For
15 years she patched and scraped and saved
and mended; there was never a penny for
a holiday or a bit of fun. At the end of
15 years her shoulders began to bend under
their burden ; and, worse, much worse, her
teihper became impaired. That alarmed her.
What Whs to happen to them all if circum-

Very kind. They did everything I asked

HARJDY’S WINES OF TIN TARA


The Old Ten-Twelve Shebang.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SHE never had no side-doors, and she
never had no screen,
Such things were not invented when
they built that old machine;
The [taint is none too clever, and her lines
is none too flash.
She’s ugly as a bag of mice with that four-
cornered dash;
Her back seat’s like a pulpit, and her hood’s
no masterpiece,
She’s knock-kneed in tin 1 hind wheels, and
her dif. is leakin’ grease;
And every dead-beat motor yarn, as fur as I
can see,
Is trotted out by some durned goat, and
tacked on her and me.
The cove that drives tint limousine that’s
standin’ by the kerb
(A “thirty” job with wire wheels and fin-
ishin’s superb),
He wears a cute, sarcastic sort of damned
annoyin’ smile
To hear me chug along on three, mis-firin’ all
the while;
But, ’struth, he’ll la 1 a hen-roost lookin’ silly
in I lie sun
Before he notches up the miles that this ’ere
car has done.
We’ve scoured the bush from end to end.
together, her and me,
And sampled every sort of road from iliil-
ston to the sea.
I’ve filled her up with mountain snow to
keep her rady cool,
And boiled her dry in black-soil mud along
be Carrathool.
From Bega out to Broken Hill, from Forbes
to Dederang,
They’ve heard of Lightnin’ Charlie and the
Old Ten-Twelve Shebang.
"Lightnin’ Charlie”! Spare .trie days, but
give a bloke his due,
For Charlie earned the moniker when that
old truck was new*.
The first car in the district, hid ! You
should have seen the fuss
The evenin’ Charlie hit tin* town a-drivin’
that there ’bus!
You should have seen: the mob go mad! You
should have heard the noise—
The tootin’ horn, the wild deUgh.t- pf all the
dogs and boys! . CSS.,.
At every window in the street yoii’d see a
head appear, r ;*
The thirsty blokes at Mrs. Flynn’s ran out
and left their beer.
This joker in the limousine, with all his
swank and power,
He don’t know what it’s like to be the hero
of the hour,
To have the crowd cofoodlin’ round dumb-
founded at the show,
And cockies gawkin’ underneath to see what
makes her go;
He don’t know' what it’s like, he don’t, to
take the girls for drives,
And get them in a motor for the first time in
their lives;
To open out and let them have the thrill that
beats the band,
And hear them do their heads and say "Ah,
Charlie, ain’t it grand !” "
He never drove a Governor, but this old
gasophone
It held his Nibship ’fore lie had a motor of
his own.
It's dinkum what I’m tell in’ you : yori recol-
lect the year
They opened up the ’orspital. and all the
nobs was here.
The squatters with their spankin’ pairs were
four and five abreast,
And every snob was at the train, and hopin’
for the best.
No charnce! They slipped a cog that day—
the blinkin’ head serang
He drove with Lightnin’ Charlie in that Old
Ten-Twelve Shebang.
She’s noisy in the timin’, and she’s wobbly
in the wrings,
She’s got a knock in every joint and song-
birds in the springs;
SHE SIMPLY COULDN'T ACCOUNT
FOR IT.
" George, isn’t it funny? I seem to get bron-
chitis every winter now!”
There’s no one wants to hire us now—them
good old times are dead
When every hour was paid in cash, booked
up a week ahead.
To picnics at the river bend, to dances done
in style,
I’d take ’em out and bring ’em home at <>ne-
and-three a mile.
They’d start the echoes with their songs,
their jokes, their gags and such.
And here’s me fig’ring out the while a rattlin’
in the clutch.
ALLOWING HER A TRIAL SHOT.
JUDGE : “Swear the witness.”
COUNSEL : “I would like her. age. It is material to”
JUDGE ( anxiously ): “Don’t swear the witness until her age is elicited.”
But when the ’bus was pullin’ sweet and
jugglin’ with the load,
The headlights larkin’ with the moon, and
pickin’ out the road.
The tree-trunks swishin’ as we went, the song
of steel to steel,
A sporty, rorty party up, and Charlie at the
wheel,
’Twas great to hear them rise them tunes I
knew when I was young—
The sort that get you all the more the more
you hear ’em sung.
I'd listen like a bloke entranced, and feel me
spirit soar,
The engine re win’ like a top, and firin’ on
the four, , . /
And all the outfit joinin’ in and helpin’ things
along,
The tappets keepin’ bonzer time and vampin’
to the song—
They’d start the feelin’s in me hair, and race
’em past control; ~,.
They’d send ’em tremblin’.through me blood,
and sparkin’ in me 'soiil;
And meltin’, too, the hearts of them that let
the world go hang
When ridin’ out with Charlie in the Old
Ten-Twelve Shebang.
The first car in the district, yes! and still
left in the hunt.
Three figures on her number-plate, and
bucket-seats in front:
She rattles like a tin of bolts, but yet when
all is said,
’Twas her and me that done the bit to shove
the game ahead.
We paved the way for slap-up jobs like this
hire limousine,
With gadgets round her dashboard like* a
blinkin’ submarine.
Fool-proof, with sweet-engagin’ clutch, the
ladies drive ’em now,
But stuck, and findin’ out mistakes, ’twas
Charlie showed ’em how.
And when, at swell club-dinners met, the big
guns of the trade
Huff out their chests aqd speechify about the
progress made,
Because some mad, well-meanin’ bloke has
stonked the fast express,
And chopped the standin’ record down by half
a shake or less,
They drink his health arid pull his leg. and
skite of what he done
(On metal roads, with engine faked, and
gearin’ three to one).
But if they got the figures right, they’d
handy them bookays
To blokes who pulled the mot’rin’ on in
pioneerin’ days,
Before the service station came with stock
of parts complete,
When. George the blacksmith helped you
with the job that had you beat —
The blokes who gave to iater blokes the
comforts they enjoy.
And proved the car was somethin’ more than
just a rich man’s toy ;
Then when they tumbled to themselves,
they’d stow the wild harangue,
And slinsr a cheer for Charlie and the Old
Ten-Twelve Shebang.

JOHN O'BRIEN.
In Tune.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Approaching from opposite sides, we
entered the bar together. As I
breasted the counter I noticed that
he hung back, as if shy. Shabbily dressed
and down at heels, there was .vet, something
about him which attracted me peculiarly,
almost compelled me to take a second look at
him.
Maybe lie signalled to me. and I responded
subconsciously; or perhaps my brain was
attuned to the broadcasted telepathic appeal
sent out by his. At all events, scarcely able
♦o help myself, so it seemed, I ordered an
extra glass and motioned to him to come
forward.
As I sipped my liquor I glanced at the,
man. His eyes met mine ; a scarcely percep-
tible nod of his head, and I was following
him to a little bench a few feet away.
We drew up chairs and made ourselves
comfortable, though all the time I knew tliat
by staying I was breaking an important
business appointment. There was something
about the man which gripped me; a shake;
of the head, a movement of the hands, ever
so slight, and I, who was unused to being
ordered, obeyed without question.
He Charged his pipe and, sitting back,
puffed at it contentedly, now and again lean-
ing forward to sip at his drink.
As yet he had not spoken, and I began to
wonder what was at the back of it all.
As I watched, he turned and snapped his
fingers, making a peculiar ringing sound. It
may have been imagination, but I could have
sworn that something among the row of
bottles and glasses at the back gave out an
answering ring. The next instant there
was a crash as a glass fell from the shelf
and broke on the stone floor.
“ ’Ere, no more o’ that! Cut it out, or
out you gee,” came from the barmaid as she
straightened a peroxided curl and turned
to smirk at a new customer who had entered
at the moment.
“What”—l began.
A nod from the old fellow cut short the
ejaculation.
“It’s all right,” he said, and in his speech
there was a note which told me plainly that
he had not always been the derelict he then
was. “The fact is,” he went on,, “although
my present appearance might belie it, I hold
the secret of a power which thousands
are trying to discover.”
His eyes went from his’stained and dirty
clothes to his empty glass. I motioned to
the' barmaid.
“You hold the secret of a power V” 1
queried.
“Ay. The power of attuning—being able
to quickly put one body in perfect tune with
another,” he explained.
“The glassV” I interposed. “How”
“Nothing, a mere nothing! Hut perhaps
1 bore you?”
"Not at all,” I assured him quickly. “I
am very interested.
“I shall be brief,” lie said, “merely touch-
ing on an early love affair. Ah, you laugh !
But I was then a very different person. My
father was an organ-maker, and to me ho
taught the art of tuning pipes and reeds,
knowledge of which is possessed by so few
in these times. For many years we
worked together, and then I took over his
business, in my spare time working at cer-
tain experiments suggested by an account of
a well-known happening "of early Christian
history.”
“You mean?” I asked.
Disregarding my query he proceeded :
“Wireless was then in its earliest infancy,
but to me it was the one thing needed to
make my discovery saleable. Although 1
did not actually use wireless as we know it
now, I was able by it to arrange one body
so that, if need be, it would vibrate in unison
with another. The power was applicable to
large bodies as well as to small, and the early
experiment of shattering a wineglass by
means of etheric waves was a very poor
thing compared with what I was able to do.
A very poor thing,” he repeated slowly, shak-
ing his head thoughtfully.
“Then, sir, when not only success but
fame was within my grasp,” he went on sud-
denly, “the girl to whom I was engaged to
be married forsook me for another, an organ-
ist who conducted the choir in which she
sang. The old, old story, you say ? Listen !
“From that time I was a different man.
I still worked at my trade, but never both-
ered any more about my experiments. I
could make a good living by my work, and
fame now had no attraction for me. Wild
ideas of revenge troubled me, but I dismissed
them all as clumsy. When T did act, it
would be in a way that would startle the
world !
“It was about three months after she was
married that I received an order for a
church organ, the biggest order I had yet
had. For the following few months my life
was full of work. Every part of the great
instrument I made myself, putting into
it my very life. It was finished in
record time, but no one was allowed to play
it until it had been Officially ‘opened.’
“On the night of the ceremony I arrived
early. Even then the church was packed
from pulpit to doors, and the crowd winch
was eager for admission could not all b;
accommodated. You see, mysterious whis-
pers had gone round of some wonderful pro
perty possessed by the instrument.”
He warmed to. the story, arid though my
feelings of awe had passed there was some-
thing in what he was telling me that held
my interest. Doubtless the man was only
a crank, his story a clever fabrication. In
all probability the beer-glass had been acci-
dentally brushed from the shelf by the flow-
ing sleeves of the barmaid !
“You see,” he continued, finishing his beer
with a gulp, "the organ was for the very
church in which she had been married, and
the minister was the one who had tied the
knot. But that was not all.”
His voice grew tense with feeling as he
lived those experiences again.
“The organist engaged to play at the open-
ing was the one who had attracted the girl
from me, and sitting in the c-hoir a few feet
from the organ was she who was once my
affianced.”
“Yes?” .1 encouraged. It was the man
himself rather than the story, I felt, which
attracted me. lie seemed somehow to be
giving the lie to his dilapidated clothes and
ill condition.
“After the usual preliminaries”—his voice
had now taken on an eager note, as if he
were anxious to unbosom himself to some-
one—“the organist took his seat at the in-
strument. He had chosen a heavy piece of
Grieg’s which, with a wonderful play of
bass notes towards the end, would bring out
the best there was in the instrument.
“This was what I was waiting for. 1
had schemed for it for months, thought
of it as I had worked at the organ. My
time for revenge had come. I could have
stood up and shouted for the very joy of it.
You see, I had worked my secret of attuning
'into the organ. I had arranged tilings so
that the instrument was in perfect tune with
the. massive church.
“Impossible? Not at all. The power is
an ancient one. Remember the old Bib Veal
story of liow Joshua commanded the Children
of Israel to march around the impregnable
walls of Jericho, and at, a given time blow a
certain note on their trumpets, at which tlie
walls swayed and fell. The sajrie thing, only
that I had applied the power more scienti-
fically.
“I knew everything was right. Sitting in
the back I could feel a gentle swaying, un-
noticeable to the others, spellbound by the
wonderful music.
“I almost laughed aloud as I thought of it.
The church would collapse, the organ be
destroyed, and she and he and I, together
with all the others, would perish!
“Music? The volume filled the church.
Tears were running down the cheeks of
many. The power made itself more felt.
THE TALK OF THE WHITE
PADDOCK.
MRS. COCHIN : “ Really , considering her ago
I think it positively indecent the way
she allows her legs to he seen!”
The swaying motion was now very pro-
nounced, but those who did notice it
put it down to the compelling influence of
the music. Everything was keyed up to the
highest pitch. A perceptible shudder ran
through the rows and rows of white faces
staring at the genius at the organ, and lit.
heedless of the destruction he was about to
cause, kept blissfully on.
“The electric lights began to swing on
their flexible wires. Out boomed the heavy
bass notes of the organ. I could feel the
church moving ! Ugh !”
With a savage grunt tile old fellow jumped
to liis feet, and moved towards the door.
“Come back,” I shouted, hurrying after
him and clutching him in my eagerness for
the rest of the story.
He paused as if doubtful of the point he
had reached.
“The bass notes had just boomed; the
church was moving on its foundations,” I
prompted. “The building, in perfect tune
with the organ, was on the point of col 1
lapsing”——
“When the attuning was suddenly shat-
tered.” he added bitterly. “Some damned
fool sneezed.”

Dind’s Hotel.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[This was written a few months before the poet's
death, while he was an inmate of the Coast Hospital,
it was his last long production in verse.]
ONE New Year’s eve, in ninety-one
or two —I’m not sure when — _
(Ah, me! How many New Year’s
eves have come and gone smee then!)
1 lived—or died —at Milson’s Point, in
Campbell-street, I think :
And 1 was dying there alone that evening
for a drink.
The landlady was out to buy our New \ ear’s
leg of swine,
The others on their own affairs; and I was
in on mine.
I sat alone till half-past eight—alone with
thirst and sin—
When one who d blown across the strait--
Fred Broomfield —thundered in.
Vice-editing The Bulletin, Fred thought
my verse “not bad” ;
lie “chanced” my first and so became my
literary dad—
A wayward dad who sometimes led his
joyous child astray,
To our most mutual delight and subsequent
dismay.
Remember Fred in those old days—the days
we used to love'.'
With pointed h ard and fierce moustache,
yet harmless as a dove,
Have when his walking-stick came down or
whirled to point a rhyme
And missed the barmaid s head —or ours —
by hairbreadths every time.
He wore beneath his fixed left wing amid
those festive scenes,
In scorn of sober knotted string, the latest
magazines.
He’d “thank whatever gods there be” and
tell the jovial crowd
Out of the night that covered him his head
was still unbowed.
But Fred was Hush that New Year's eve and
things were more than well;
We hurried out of Campbell-street, and
round to Hind’s hotel,
Where, after two long beers apiece, we
found the world “orright,”
And told the boss our bleeding heads were
pretty fair that night.
We went to think “Where next?” and get
a breath of air outside,
When down the street from Blue’s Point-
road we saw two bushmen ride.
I could have sworn by “ ’larstin-sides” and
trousers, shirts and hats,
That they were from the Hawkesbury and
farmed the river flats.
They got down by the water-trough and
asked "Would you chaps here
.list mind our horses for us while we go and
have a beer?
If .ver don’t mind”—l am not sure (and
detail is a gem)
If they said “hold” their horses, or “jist lend
an eye” to them.
Ho they went in and had their drinks, for
they had ridden far;
And they came out and sent us in -they’d
left two on the bar.
Then we came out and sent them in; and
each two held debates
Till each one got ••fed up” with each, and
started swapping mates.
Mil native from the Hawkesbury was all 1
could desire;
He said his name was Mclntosh—the other’s
Mclntyre.
So we shook hands; and then he said he’d
"give it to me straight”—
He told me that I didn’t know what he’d
done for liis mate.
He said “Yer don’t know what it is to have
a mate —like me —
Without no spark o’ gratitood, nor commin
decencv.”
We needn’t mind the horses now ; they’d be
oniglit, lie said.
His horse we saw was fast asleep, the other
horse was “dead.”
We sought, and found, and lost back gates.
We stumbled over stools.
We wept and swore because our mates were
such damn silly fools.
We’d stuck to them through thick and thin
t and fought for them—damned hard.
We’d helped them with their missuses—and
this was our reward!
But that was past. We would not go and
drink with them, we swore- —
And next we all were in the bar and mixing
mates some more.
We argued over and explained—apologised
for —sunk
The little things of mountainous importance
to a drunk ;
But only to refloat, refit, beg-pardon for, ex-
plain,
Forget and laugh at them and sink or “drop
it all” again.
Our enemies were not so bad ; our friends
began the row—
The wives that nagged us into pubs were
Noble Women now.
Then somehow Fred and I were both out-
side, and there was he
Mounted on one horse while he held Ihe
other one for me.
He sat his horse in studied style, and held,
you may be sure,
His everlasting stick, and damned imported
literature.
I’d not been on a horse since first I left my
native scene,
And to this day I don’t believe that Fred
had ever been.
So I hopped on. We both resolved to gallop
fast and far
(The natives from the Hawkesbury had new
mates in the bar) ;
And as we turned for Neutral Bav, where
roads ran through the scrub,
Tiro other New I ear chaps- rode up and
halted at the pah.
They hung their horses by the trough, they
cleared their throats of phlegm,
And asked a casual cove outside to “give an
eye to them.”
But we jogged slowly up the track, our horses;
side bv s'de ;
And Fred declared that, though “unbowed,”'
his head enjoyed the ride.
Then suddenly I had a thought—“ Those last
two chaps,” I said,
“Might ask the two from Hawkesbury to
mind their horses, Fred!”
And, even as I spoke, upon what poets call
the “wind”
There came a sound above the beer of horses
close behind.
"Freelances to the front!” cried Fred. "The
night has called for deeds!
The Ilawkesbury is out for war on other
captured steeds!
Bide for The Bulletin!” lie cried; and
where the night grew thick
He shot ahead with all his legs and wings
and whirling stick.
1 caught him up and on we raced, in spit"
of ruts and holes,
And thanked the gods that were for our un-
conquerable souls.
We heard the hoof-beats and the yells. The
path with shade was blind.
"Bide, Harry, ride!” the Broomfield cried,
"the clans are hard behind !”
His charger slithered on the sward and fell
with feet outspread;
But he was up as soon as down, and on the
top was Fred.
He waved his stick as ’twere the sword of
mightv Saladin,
And still he held the printed tripe (imported
for our sin).
The natives caught 11s somewhere near the
head of Neutral Bay,
Beside a little ancient pub that knew the
whalers’ day.
At first their words were harsh and wild—
unpleasant, on the whole—
“ They didn’t come to Sydney for to git their
horses stole” ;
WHEN THE QUARREL REGAN.
THE WIFE ( pathetically ): “Sometimes I can hardly believe you are the same man who
was so kind when we were married.”
THE BRUTE : "No. Ere never been the same man since.”
But when we asked them in to drink before
we had the tight,
They stared and said, “Well I’ll be
damned”; and then they said “Awe-
right.”
When we got back to Dind’s hotel, by light
of star and moon—
( I used to write by moon and star, but wish
to change the tune.
The poets wear out. countless stars on
pleasant “lands afar”;
But I’m content to work with one, and let
it rhyme with bar.
To tell the truth, I would not swear that we
had any light
Except the inner lamp of beer on that old
New Year’s night).
When we got back to Dind’s hotel, with or
without a star,
The Adam of all rows was making history
in the bar,
Was giving new tradition birth and legend
heretofore
Unknown, except to whalers, in the story of
the Shore;
And by the scuffling, bumping sound, and by
a voice we knew.
’Twas very plain the publican was in the
trouble too.
We heard remarks like “Shanghai pub,”
“horse thieves” and “lambin’ down,”
And “push an’ crooks when decent coves like
us come into town,”
And "chuckers-out and talents with the pub-
licans behind!”
To which the publican replied “Stow that,
young fellers—mind !
Yer horses ain’t behind the bar nor on the
blanky shelves.
Lit out, yer jumped-up fools, and find ver
carrion yerselves!’
Unside, Ah Soon, the Chinese cook, stood
gazing at the Point
As calmly as a cop surveys a dark and silent
joint.
lie dropped his dream as *we got down—he’d
known us for a week—
And spoke as one who’d suddenly been gal-
vanised to speak:
"Me take two horse! Sav pnt-tem yard—-me
fix him up all li ;
You fo go home —some other pub! Ti.o
much, by kli’, insi’!”
But we did not. At Dind’s hotel—for those
were days of sin—•
Suv horsemen drank the Old Year out and
drank the New Year in.
\\ e made new friends, we hugged old mates,
laughed, wept or raised a cheer —
For hills appear like Everest when measured
up by beer.
Our wives were “light,” our mates were
"white.” ’twas we began the row;
But all in this old foolish world was “fixed
up orright now.”
Four horses by the water-trough touched
noses now and then—-
They’d long since ceased to wonder at the
windy ways of men—
But whether Fred went home with me. or I
went home with him,
I can’t recall. Those dear dea‘d days are
too far off and dim.
Our wives would always “save a drop” and
never make a fuss ;
For they were just to our old mates and
lenient with us.
As I lie stricken here for sins that were not
sinned in vain,
I thank whatever gods may be for freedom
from the pain ;
And if there’s truth in doctor’s talk—and all
the signs are plain—
Then neither Fred nor I shall walk, much
less ride out again.
But you, who write when we are gone, go
tell the passing crowd
That to the last each bleeding head was very

HENRY LAWSON.
The Punishing of Mokotu.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
WILLIAM lIEYSON stepped out on to
the verandah of his trading station
in the Papuan Gulf, gazed scarch-
ingly at the empty half-circle of the sea and
at the triple line of breakers crashing along
the whole wide sweep of the beach, and then
addressed in the vernacular a native who
had come to the foot of the steps.
“It’s no use coming here, Labasi. The
trade-room is empty. I have r.o tobacco, no
calico, no rice. There has been a big wind
somewhere, as you can see by the size of the
surf, and it has made the store-boat late.’’
The native shook his head.
“I. come not to trade, Master,” lie said
harshly. “I come because a bad thing has
happened to me. A very bad thing.” With-
out invitation he ascended the steps.
“Master, Master, do you think the Govern-
ment would be angry if I killed a man?”
He was old and wrinkled, but his tall
frame still spoke of the mighty strength that
had once been his. Save for a narrow girdle
of discolored cloth he was naked. His chest
was scored with the markings of high chief-
tainship.
"My blood burns like tire for the anger
that is in me,” he went on quickly. "I can-
not eat for thought of it, and at night no
sleep comes to my eyes. Sometimes I tremble
as from fever”-
He stamped his naked foot, and his eyes
shone.
“The old man who buys a young wife buys
trouble,” he declared. "Always is it so.
Always. But I did not think my wife, the girl
Sisina, would so behave when I bought her
from her father with the many things 1 had
gathered. I thought her heart would be glad
that she was the wife of a chief, a big chief.
But who can tell the ways of a woman?”
"Why.” asked lleyson, "what has she
done?”
"She likes another man. It is the young
man Mokotu. He talks much about his
strength and skill. He is clever with the
bow and the spear, and his arms are rounded
and full, lie sends his canoe at great speed,
and his body bends sweetly to the paddle.
He leads in the dances, and his voice in the
songs is loud and clear. Sisina, my wife,
likes him because he is young and strong.”
lie paused.
"And she likes me no longer because I am
old. Master. The young like the young—and
strong.”
"I see,” said lleyson, glancing seaward for
sign of the store-boat. "But how do you
know all this?”
"For long have 1 thought it must be as 1
have said. 1 love Sisina, and the eyes of
love are sharp. For two weeks past has Sisina
been late in coming from the gardens at the
end of the day. Not till long after the
other women had returned did she come. In
answer to my questions, she said the ground
was hard from lack of rain and the yams
took long to dig. She lied, Master.”
He clenched his thin hands so tightly that
the knuckle-bones showed white beneath his
dark-brown skin.
"To-day 1 went to the gardens and hid
among the banana-trees. It was as I had
thought. They met. My eyes saw, Master,
and ray ears heard. Mokotu spoke mocking
words of me. My arms were thin like a
spear, he said. My breast was narrow like
the breast of a bird, and my face was ugly.
1 was a stupid old man, and strength was no
longer mine. And Sisina listened, smiling, to
all he said, and told him she hoped I would
soon die, so that the young and strong Moko-
tu could buy her for his wife.” lie drew
himself stiffly erect. “He spake thus of me
-—of Labasi the canoe-chief, who in his youth
was strongest of all the men and best with
the paddle! lie spake thus of me! Master,
Master, my anger was so great I could have
killed at once this man who has stolen the
love of my young wife. 1 had taken my
bow and arrows. It would have been easy.”
Again he paused, making an obvious effort
to regain his self-control.
“But no longer am 1 a foolish youth who
acts without thought. If I killed Mokotu,
ma.vbe the Government would take me away
to the gaol-house. It were better I spoke
first, with a white man who is my friend.
And so I come to you. Master. Would the
Government be angry if I killed this stealer
of my wife’s love? It is the custom of us
natives to kill such thieves—but the Govern-
ment thinks in ways different from us.”
“If you kill him you will go to the gaol-
house truly enough. And maybe you will
never return. Maybe, indeed, you will be
hanged.”
“Then what am I to do? As to Sisina.
1 thought to thrash her, though it is but
little use to beat the body and leave the
spirit untouched. What am I to do? —-Ah,
what is that they cry?” he asked as a shout
came from the village along the beach. “It
is the ‘Sail-oh !’ ”
Heyson brought binoculars and made out
on the far horizon a ketch, with booms out-
swung and the thrust of the swell directly
behind her, heading straight for the shore.
“It. is the store-boat at last!” lie said.
Labasi nodded unconcernedly. “What am I
to do?” he repeated. Then suddenly his face
lit up as with an idea.
“The boat will need someone from the
shore to guide her into the anchorage of the
river mouth.” lie cried. “Someone will have
to go off through the surf and show her the
way. And it is a big surf. A very big surf.
Mokotu boasts lie is good with the paddle.
Mokotu” With surprising agility he
went down the steps. Heyson watched him,
wondering; and presently went to the beach
to await the coming of the ketch.
It was indeed a big surf. It was the big-
gest that had thundered on the beach
for years. The village’s Old Men observed,
in tlie manner of all old men, that it reminded
them of the surfs of their youth. The rollers
swept shorewards over the curve in an endless
procession of mobile mountains, stately and
rhythmic, their tops all rounded and smooth,
their velvety slopes unbroken, till they cast
themselves on the sand in smothers of foam.
The villagers watched the ketch heave-to
and run up a flag for a pilot. They shook
their fuzzy heads as they looked at tlie white
boiling of the seas.
“No canoe could live in such a surf,” said
one to Heyson.
“Let some try,” said the trader. “If the
boat comes not now into the river she will
go on, and land the trade-things on her way
back. And my store-room is empty. Let
some try. I will give a good present to him
who guides the boat in—tobacco, red calico,
a looking-glass.”
Two young, men elected to make the
attempt, and launched a double canoe. In
two minutes it filled, overturned and was
tossed back on tlie beach. The young men.
swept sprawling ashore, spat the sand from
their mouths and slunk off.
"It. needs men very skilled in the use of
the paddle to get through,” declared Labasi,
appearing from out the crowd. “Let the young
man Mokotu try. Mokotu speaks much of
his prowess with the paddle. Is lie afraid?
Does lie fear to wet his strong young body?
Does he doubt the strength and skill 'of
which he has spoken so much?”
As a result of this and further taunting
the lover of Sisina stepped out and went
along the beach to where a small canoe was
drawn high up on the sand. He was a good-
looking young man, with a great mop of oiled

hair, wearing a colored loincloth of many
folds, and about his waist a broad belt of
Avoven orchid stems ivliich gaA'e an almost
feminine curve to his hips. Watching his
chance, he launched the canoe, jumped in,
seized the paddle, and Avith a feAV well-timed
strokes shot past the first line of breakers.
The crowd acclaimed his judgment and skill.
“It is nothing!” said Labasi to Heyson.
"It is the first line only. And there are
three. A child could do as much.”
For a long time Mokotu’s efforts were
directed towards keeping in the ever-shifting
strip of unbroken water between the first
and second lines. It was no mean feat, and
it called for the exercise of all his skill. He
went ahead or astern as occasion demanded,
acting Avith that quick certainty Avliich comes
of long practice, Avaiting for the slight pause
in the succession of the seas which would
allow him to get beyond the second line.
Heyson turned his attention to Sisina.
The girl’s eyes Ayere fixed on that black spot
which was a man in the waste of the waters.
She gesticulated and chattered. When the
canoeman, by nice judgment, escaped what
seemed certain destruction, she exclaimed her
admiration louder than the rest.
Mokotu decided that his chance to get
through the second line had come. With a
sudden rapid plying of the paddle he sent
liis frail craft flying forward. .It dipped out
of sight in the trough of the seas, to re-
appear midway up the slope of the giant
second breaker. Heyson held his breath in
suspense. A moment later the side of the
great wave sank inwards, a ribbon of white
appeared along its top, widened with mon-
strous quickness—and the sea broke. Man
and canoe were lost in a welter of tumbling
Avater. Mokotu had misjudged by a fraction
of time, and, as a penalty, the outrigger was
torn from his canoe and he Avas flung on
the beach, bruised, shaken and half-filled with
Avater. Only by a miracle had be escaped
being' beaten to death by the tumbling tons
of Avater.
Without moving Labasi Avatched the lover
of his Avif’e being helped away. And now,
dramatically, Labasi announced that he him-
self Avould go off to the ketch.
Heyson tried to restrain him; but he
shook the white man off.
His canoe was a single log of a certain
light wood, smoothly hollowed and finished,
curved slightly at bow and stern, and having
an outrigger of carefully-lashed sticks at-
tached to one side. It had a buoyant SAveep
that Avas lacking in the other canoes, and
the under part of the stem Avas sharply cut.
Heyson lmeAv it for one of Labasi’s own
manufacture.
THE LESSER EVIL.
PIERROT: “But why do you flirt with me so if you’re in lore
with Hurry?”
PIER: “Weil, you see , father can't stand him; but if he thinks
I want you he’ll be only too glad to compromise and
let are have Harry.”
Taking a paddle with a blade shaped like
an arrow-head, he launched'the canoe in the
backwash of the first breaker, climbed aboard,
and with surprising ease shot through to the
position between the first and second lines
where Mokotu had met with disaster. Then
he began that business of going ahead and
astern in order to keep in unbroken water
while awaiting the opportunity to pass be-
yond the second line.
But he did not make the mistake Mokotu
had made. The young man had been de-
ceived by a false pause. Not so was Labasi
deceived. He knew the tricks and wiles of
the surf. He matched his skill and experi-
ence against its cunning. Not for nothing
had lie been the best surf-runner of his day.
He had seen those inviting half-halts of the
seas before. _ For a full half-hour he tossed
in that shifting strip of blue water between
the tumbling walls of white, his hands on
the paddle with a tensely nervous grip, bis
eyes keenly alert. From the beach it seemed
as though he sensed the intention of each
sea as it rose and curved before him.
The pause for which he was waiting came
with a suddenness which would have been
entirely without warning to a less experi-
enced man. Though it lasted but a few
moments Labasi had anticipated it. With
nice judgment of time and distance he sent
the canoe forward ten or a dozen yards.
Then he stopped. A line of breakers still
faced him. But it was the third lino. The
second was now behind him, crashing furi-
ously on the very spot where lie had been
but a moment before. Labasi bad got
through where Mokotu had failed.
As the crowd on the beach Vented their
applause, Heyson looked again at Bisina. She
was now standing as near to the water’s
edge as she dared, the backwash swirling
to the bottom of her waist-to-knee petticoat,
the spray showering her naked breast. Her
lithe body swayed from side to side, as
though in time to a song she was singing.
Her lover, Mokotu, now somewhat recovered,
approached her. She pushed him away and
went on staring across the white boiling of
the seas.
Wondering, Heyson turned again to watch
Labasi. The second line Avas bad, but the
third was worse —much worse. Here the
greatest of the rollers tripped and fell; the
smaller ones travelled closer to the shore
before striking the shallows that toppled
them over. The rollers of the outer line
sAvept up in the full of their might and
majesty, the very pulse of the deeper sea.
Great, round-topped giants, they moved
serenely, sure of their strength, unconscious
of the * shelving land which lay waiting to
strike away their foundations. And the
might of their fall Avas in keeping Avith their
stately majesty. It Avas cosmic. As though
in sudden flush of anger at being deceived,
they shook their heads, paused for one dread-
ful moment, and then collapsed with a roar
like the bellow of a volcano.
Labasi kept bis canoe directly facing them,
just out of reach of their fall. With the
tremendous sAvell continually urging him
back tOAvards the second line, the maintain-
ing of his position called for unrelaxing Avork
with the paddle. Heyson felt that such un-
remitting labor was for younger men
Labasi’s muscles would be aching from the
unaccustomed strain. His fingers Avould be
stiff from gripping the paddle, and his legs
from the long-continued kneeling. But the
old man showed no sign of giving in.
And then at long last there showed far
out to sea a roller greater than all the rest.
Its smooth top stood above the others like
a tall man among children. In passing it
tossed the ketch high on its crest, and surged
down towards the man Avho, in a preposter-
ous affair of a liolloAved log and lashed sticks,
defied its fury.
It was for that Labasi had been waiting.
By reason of its greater momentum the giant
Avave would break nearer the shore than the
others. Labasi rushed his canoe back a
little, and then, at exactly the right moment,
rushed it forward again. The wave crashed
into foaming white on the place where he
had waited for so long. The great roller
had disturbed the regularity of the breaking
seas for just long enough to allow Labasi to
get through. W ith the dreaded third line no\A r
safely astern, the canoe surged through froth
and flying spray into the
unbroken outside water
and to the ketch.
The villagers shouted
and danced their glee.
Truly lie was a great
canoeman, they cried, the
greatest of all canoemen!
And when the ketch was
safely anchored in the
smooth water of the river-
mouth they crowded about
the bank to give him wel-
come. But as he stepped
ashore, Sisina ran ahead
of the others, and Hey-
son, who had come to the
river to see to the land-
ing of his stores, heard
her cry :
“Labasi ! I am glad of
you, Labasi! My heart
is light as with laughter!
I thought you were old.
that strength was no
longer yours. But now I
know it is not so. You
are strong Labasi! You
are brave ! I am proud
you are my husband ! I
am proud to be your wife !
No other woman has a
man so brave and
strong. •
“It is well,” Labasi
said in an aside to Hey-
son. “By the cunning of
my old head did I defeaf
the surf after Mokotu’s
strong young arms had
failed. The old has de-
feated the young, Master,
and I have put shame
upon Mokotu. And to
put shame upon boasting
youth is to put a punish-
ment more severe than
death.”
lie turned and looked steadily at Sisina.
“Once I thought to thrash you,” he said.
Then he laid a caressing hand upon her arm
and smiled his gratification of her pride of
him.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE mixed train crawled along in the
late twilight from siding to siding as
if feeling its way through the manuka
and flax that bordered the line. The small
engine seemed totally inadequate. It coughed
and it wheezed as a grimy fireman raked its
vitals for the ultimate ounce of power, and
sympathetic passengers felt relief when de-
clines were come to and the engine, throttled
down, metaphorically sat back in the breech-
ing and allowed the long rake of trucks and
carriages to push it gently to the bottom. An
icy wind wailed between the carriages, and
rain pattered against the closed windows,
mercifully blurring the sodden swamp-lands
beyond.
At Green Bush siding three laden men
clambered on the platform of a second-class
carriage and peered in at the door, letting
in a spattering of rain and a draught as
cold as a lean barber’s fingertips.
“There, I told yer this wasn’t a smoker,”
growled a voice in gloomy triumph. “I said
it was further back.”
A despairing shriek came from the engine.
“Never mind, the train’s off now,” said an-
other voice. “ ’Op in ’ere. It ain’t far to
Tui-Kea, anyhow.”
They filed in. each carrying his belongings
in a bran-bag, and stood awkwardly between
the double row of knees. The carriage was
pretty full already, mostly of women, but
the occupants pushed along and made room
in the centre. With much labor and confu-
sion the bags were stowed on the narrow
rack, and the trio sat down. The one who
bad advised the ’op in ’ere was tall and
cheerful-looking, with pale-blue eyes and an
enormous red moustache ; obviously a kindly
soul of friendly disposition. He glanced
smilingly round the compartment, and nodded
a comprehensive greeting.
"If there’s much more o’ this rain it’ll be
look out fer a flood,” he remarked jocularly
by way of putting the company at its ease.
“Good gracious, we don’t want any
more flood!” ejaculated a nervous-looking
woman down the carriage.
“Well,” said the
kindly man, with a
sudden and sympa-
thetic seriousness,
“more likely things
than a flood ’ave ’ap-
pened before to-day.
But, as I always says,
wot is to be will be.
Even if it never ’ap-
pens!” he added pro-
foundly.
Next to the speaker
was tli e growler,
heavy of limb and
countenance, his hat
pulled down over dark,
bushy brows. His
face carried the scowl
of a confirmed nark.
The third sat at the
nark’s right, a small
man with ferrety black
moustache, prominent
eyes that looked
vacant, and a set grin
of extraordinary ami-
ability. He was
directly opposite a
large woman of aus-
tere appearance. She
sat grimly upright, un-
bendingly superior, an
unwanted i n t r u d e r
amidst more human
neighbors—a humorless first-classer ai the
wrong address. The little man seemed fas-
cinated. He fixed his eyes on her in a stare
that lasted to Tui-Kea.
With the advent of the three ’op-in-’eres a
lusty aroma of beer drifted through the car-
riage. The superior lady sniffed suspiciously.
“What is that awful odor, Dorothy V” she
asked a small girl beside her.
“It smells like beer, auntie,” answered the
child simply.
The man with the perpetual grin gave a
sharp chuckle. “Dorothy’s right, missus,”
he said. “It is beer. We been takin’ a drop
to keep the ’flu away.”
The large lady drew in her breath and
gazed at him incredulously. "1 beg your
pardon !” she gasped haughtily.
The little man seemed bewildered. "Don’t
mention it, missus,” he answered uncompre-
htndinglv. “Yer never touched my toe.”
Her gaze turned to a glare of speechless
exasperation, but the effort was wasted. No
sign of embarrassment showed on the small
man’s face. Instead lie returned her gaze
with interest, and looked, if possible, more
diabolically amiable than before. She noticed
a row of lowered heads as fellow-passengers
strove to conceal their joy. and leaned back
in a futile effort to avoid the persistent eyes
opposite.
By a series of remarkable gestures the
red-moustached man gained her attention.
He winked violently, and nodded sideways to-
wards the small man. Then lie rapped his
knuckles hard on his own head as if seeking
admission to his inmost thoughts. This
dumb show was meant to explain that the
man with the permanent grin was not alto-
gether right in the head.
“A good bloke, though,” began the tail
man in a hoarse whisper, which was audible
throughout the carriage. His eulogy ended
abruptly. The swaying of the vehicle caused
one of the bran-bags to roll from the rack.
It fell impartially on the heads of the nark
and the man with the mammoth moustache.
“There y’ go!” spluttered the nark; but
his mate laughed boisterously.
“Ha, ha!” he bellowed. “Good job i'
wasn’t a mete’rite, or we’d ha’ been angels
now!”
He apologised to the woman who owned
the lap, retrieved the bag and felt anxiously
along its side. “Better not risk it again,”
he remarked cryptically, and, untying the
hayband fastening, lie drew forth a bottle
of beer and pushed the bag under the seat.
“With the usual apologies,” he said, pull-
ing the cork and embracing the company in
a wide smile. Then he remarked “G’luck,”
and the bottle seemed to echo the sentiment
as the tall man drank. The nark refreshed
himself in turn —without apology or toast—
and the bottle went on to the small man. He
seemed to know of its approach by instinct.
Without for a moment removing his gaze
he reached round and grasped it. For a
few seconds lie held it poised before him.
Then he nodded pleasantly to the superior
lady. “Here’s the skin off yer nose, missus,”
he said sociably, and began to drink. Yet
even as he imbibed he screwed the bottle a
little to the side so that with one eye at
least he could gaze unblinkingly at the large
woman.
“Oh. deah ! This is terrible!'’ she moaned.
“I will be glad when the journey is done!”
A sound of partly-suppressed giggling to
right and left did not reduce her unhappi-
ness;.
The man with the never-ending grin care-
fully put the empty bottle on the floor, where
it clinked musically against the wall as the
carriage swayed.
“We’re flaxcutters,” he announced sud-
denly, with apparent pride. “We just cut
out at ole McGregoFs mill at Gfeen Bush.
We’re goin’ to Murphy’s pub at Tui-Kea
fer a spell now. Great place f’r booze, Tui-
Kea. D’you live there, missus?”
The superior lady groaned; but there
was no escaping the direct attack of
the man with the ineradicable grin. She
answered frigidly and slowly, aiid'with care-
fully guarded diction :
THE POPULOUS NORTH.
ROPER RIVER ROLAND: “Ah' some folks have
th' blarsted ’ide to say the North is
empty!”
“No! Ae live in lilveivaligilh There is
no drink theali —it is a dray town/’
“Ha! 11a! Ha! Invercarg'll a dry town!”
The explosion came from the mall with the
colossal moustache. “Dry!” And he was oft
again. “Why, mum,” he confided when lie
recovered his breath, “there's two breweries
goin’ eyes-out alongside the place, ah thou-
sands o’ kegs emptied every year— besides
wot comes from The Bluff in each tram.
Invergargle! Dry! Ha! Ha! Ha.
Ahead in the sodden darkness the insuf-
ficient locomotive squealed again. The car-
riage door opened and a guard came in.
“Tui-Kea,” lie announced briskly, and
skilfully threaded the projecting knees.
The 'flax-cutters gathered up their belong-
ings, waded laboriously out and shut the door
as the train slackened speed.
“Thank goodness, they are gone!” sighed
the superior lady. “Wliat dr-m/r/ful men:
Probably Australians!” she added as an
afterthought.
Suddenly a cry came from the platform,
followed by a slight bump. A moment later
the face of the little amiable man peered in
at the door.
“Bob’s fell overboard !” he announced ex-
citedly—Bob was the nark. "The wheel
went over ’is stummick !”
There was a chorus of shocked "Ohs! ’ in
the carriage, and women huddled closer to-
gether after the custom of their kind m
moments of horror. Presently the train
stopped, and a guard, lamp in hand, ran
along the line, followed by the nark s two
mates. The little girl raised the window
and looked out.
“Dorothy ! Dorothy ! How dare you look
at such a sight!” shrieked the large woman
hysterically. “The man will be nothingnow
but mangled remains! Oh, dear, dear! uas
there ever such an experience!”
Soon voices sounded on the platform and
floated into the carriage, and hearing them
the passengers sighed relievedly. Curiosity
drew Dorothy’s aunt to the window.
“Yer pushed me off. yer long, red-faced
cow!” a voice growled savagely. “A man
might easy ’a’ been killed! As it is me
swag’s spoilt!”
“I thought the wheel went over yer stum-
mirk, Bob.” (The little man’s voice held a
note of disappointment.)
“No, I never pushed yer,” the tall man
said aggrievedly. “You slipped off.”
“If it’d been yer stummick /” persisted the
short man.

“To save me!” sneered the nark bitterly.
“You save me ! Har-r! Go an’ tell that to

“I told ’er about it already!” cried the
little man triumphantly. “But I thought it
was yer stummick. An’ now it’s only yer
swag.” His voice trailed off reproachfully.
“He must mean you, auntie,” said the little
girl in the carriage.
“Silence; child. llow dare you !” squealed
the distracted woman. “Oh dear ! Will this
ordeal never end !”
A face appeared at the window. It be-
longed to the diminutive, man with the fade-
less grin.
“I could ha’ swore the wheel went over ’is
stummick, missus!” he said.
The descending window missed his grin
by half an inch.

The Psychology of
Pscents.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE power of smell lias a provocative
influence upon the minds, not only of
people generally, but, if we are to
believe the tales of the Orientals, of demons
also; for just as “an apple a day keeps the
doctor away,” so will the odor of fried tish
drive the most determined devil spluttering
to the gutter.
Odors of all kinds act by association on
the cells of the memory; thus, if I happen
across the tiniest whiff of petrol while
threading the traffic of Pitt-street I am in
New York at that very instant. Similarly,
Mr. Fearn, an 18th-century traveller" could
never smell a pie without remembering Bass-
orah, where he once swallowed seven —two
of goat’s meat, two of stewed mutton, and
three of the common bird-cherry.
As well as pies, some human beings have
their own private perfumes; perhaps very
interested ones might even make a collection
of them. For instance, I can remember a
musician who carried about with him all the
essences of a crowded police-court on a hot
October morning. We have it, through
Crabb Robinson’s authority, that Blake did
not smell well, and the knowledge of this
fact, for some perverse reason, has always
interfered with my enjoyment of his poetry.
Like the olden deities he stood surrounded by
ambrosial clouds; and it needs little imagi-
nation to hear Crabb, at Fountain Court,
exclaim in the words of Ilippolites dying, “I
know that thou are near me, for I have
recognised thy balmy odor.” This was not
an inexistent fragrance, like the one conjec-
tured by the perfume-hating hypochondriac
who fainted at sight of an artificial rose.
Certain it is that Blake’s presence
breathed out no virtue of precious ointment;
and his negligent ideas of cleanliness (which

he shared with Socrates) puts ns in mind of
how that judges formerly had bouquets of
lavender-buds placed in water always about
them for prevention of prison-fever. Princes,
too, wore nosegay nets across their breasts,
dependent from the head ; and Queen Eliza-
beth religiously employed, upon days of pub-
lic processions, a pomatum of her own inven-
tion made from winter-pears, mixed, or
medled, with the marrow of a young dog.
The pews in the churches were decorated
with blossoms wherever it was possible, and
for the same purpose, viz., to ward off infec-
tion. Moreover, it has been said that Saladin
was in receipt of a bill for rosewater, sup-
plied to his order, and used in washing the
floor and ceiling of Omar’s mosque in 1187.
Richelieu kept a perfumed bellows to sweeten
his room. Dona Oliva Sabruco Barrera
warned her clients against the perils of
noxious air. She even stated that horses
commonly died on account of stable-filth be-
ing cut open by spades when men were
employed at the business of cleaning. She
also assumed that, at plague-time, infection
might occur through the eyes, for “by sight
there is ready access to the brain.” It fol-
lowed, therefore, according to her argument,
that the best w r ay of addressing a contact
was to shut both eyes, hold on to your nose—-
and damn the American accent. After that
you hurried home and ate roasted apples
stuffed with frankincense.
Talking of frankincense, I am reminded
that it was once my lot to travel by the
worst-smelling ship that ever polluted Aus-
tralian waters, an experience I am unable
to forget. We were served with dirty sheets
for our mattresses, dirty plates for break-
fast, and the butter looked as if it had walked
of itself from the cook’s galley, and fallen
down three or four times. When we went
on deck we could see other vessels avoiding
us; and the very waves, fearful of contami-
nation, sprang to a terrible distance, turn-
ing their crests, and seeming to stop their
nostrils. Naturally, as passengers, we were
humiliated, and hated to bo identified with
such an Ark of Pestilence. This brought it
home to me how ashamed a flea must feel
when decent dogs discover him upon a fox’s
back.
In the world of miracles Alexander the
Great might as truthfully have been called
the Sweet, for the sun drew only a delicious
aroma out of his body, so that he exhaled

incense like the moustaches of Michael Lord
of Montaigne. Ah, those moustaches! “Let
me but approach my gloves or my liand-
kereher to them, their smell will stick upon
them a whole clay. They manifest the place
where I come from. The close-smacking,
sweetness-moving, love-alluring and greedy-
smirking kisses of youth were heretofore
wont to lodge in them many hours after.”
Montaigne is, of course, above suspicion ; but,
in general it was (and still is) adjudged
better to be scentless.
“To smell sweet is to stink.”
Such too was Rabelais’s opinion; where-
fore I pray you please to glance upon this
paragraph for proof: “My humor is much
better contented with the pretty dishevelled
shepherdesses, whose bodies through their
coarse canvas smocks smell of the clover-
grass of the fields, than with those great
ladies in magnificent courts with their
flaunting topknots, their pastillos and cos-
metics.”
The moment a Roman was proscribed it
became his business to jump into a hot bath
in order that he might rid himself of
unguents, the vapor of which even the most
dilettante bloodhound would hit off at first
sniff. Lucius Plotus neglected these precau-
tions, with the result that the police “got on
to his scent” right away ; yet were they com-
pelled to bury their noses under folds • of
fair linen-cloth during the time that they
were killing him, otherwise his pungent exha-
lations must have caused haemorrhage and
death.
Rousseau declares the sense of smell to be
the sense of imagination ; and he is right.
According to this idea, Kama, the Indian
Cupid, shoots flowers into the heart. Me
never misses, and distance offers not even a
pretence of security. I know, because he
once reached myself—in 1914 —with a deli-
cate mango-blossom.
The mention of this little creature
Kama puts me in mind of that other,
found in Tartary, like unto a roe, and
“which,” as Hakluyt deponeth, “they take
in snares and flog to death : after that they
ent out the bones and beat the flesh with
the blood, very small, and fill the skin with
it; and hereof cometli musk.”
Many years ago Dutch merchants kept
civet-cats in boxes at Amsterdam, and had
the perfume scraped out of them two or
three times a week; while one, a certain
Van Lofting, used to dry-dock his own pri-
vate whale for ambergris every year—on
the twenty-third of September.
The pretty legend written round the
hunted beaver is of too private a nature to
be printed in the present century, and the
same may be said of an account relating how
elephants were caught with ointment in Pegu.
Dry-dock his own private whale.
A peculiar custom of the Australian
blacks is worthy of being recorded. It is
this: that their maidens wrap themselves
round with sheets of myall bark on the last
three nights preceding their espousal, and for
the reason that the New South Wales acacia
lends to anyone who touches it an intense
and delightful smell of violets.
Referring back to the ancients, they were
true men of their noses, and had them trained
so well that they would often point to and
follow deeply-scented wines or ladies, not-
withstanding the remaining features con-
tinued in an opposite direction. Cornelius
Tacitus, tied upon a cross, had his nose rise
over his forehead in a marvellous fashion
seeking a flower held by a vestal among tue
crowd that was behind him. These nasal
gymnastics were then common to all culti-
vated nations, and began with them from
the cradle, mothers even suggesting profes-
sions to their offspring while that they drank
their first milk. Thus the mama of Julius
Homulus pressed shrimps to his nostrils in
the hope he might one day become an
admiral; and Hispulla, desiring nothing so
much as a rich marriage for her son, had the
infant daughter of Genialis breathe upon
him regularly every morning, she, by way of
gentle retaliation, sometimes reversing the
process by drawing his breath into her mouth.
So it was with them from their swaddling-
clouts even to the moment of putting on
their shrouds —beginning, perhaps, as
Homulus did, with shrimps at the nose, and
ending, like Sabinanus, by a gust from a
fumed picture. Their old people ordinarily
smelled at turves of fresh earth as being
wholesome for the body; upon which habit
So will the odor of fried fish drive the most

HUGH McCRAE.
The Rudeness of Rupert.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT may be said without indelicacy, per-
haps, that while the Blookers can bodst
a genealogy inferior to that of few, they
have never been wantonly fecund. As
to relations, I have consequently had to
count myself poor. In one of a retiring
nature, ill-fitted for social adventure, such
a condition is unfortunate, for man is nor-
mally gregarious. That I should have
chosen for espousal a Miss Battersby may,
therefore, be regarded as a
happy circumstance, for the family com-
prises one of the completest memorials to
connubial felicity one could meet. One
would have to go a long way, for in-
stance, to meet a sweeter woman than my
wife’s half-sister, Mrs. Pottleby, or a more
likeable man, for that matter, than Wilfred
Pottleby himself. To the Hoopers, too, I
warmed from the start, while some of the
most interesting evenings I have ever spent
have been in the company of my sister-in-
law Emily’s husband, Henry Sudge. For
almost all of my wife’s people I conceived
at least a tolerance —for all except her sister
Millicent and my nephew Rupert.
For Herbert Wimpole him-
self one had to feel compassion.
A spare, sandy, rather sad-
looking man, my brother-in-law,
with a tendency to catarrh, but
many sterling points. Incapa-
city to assert himself—that
was Herbert’s failing. It was lack of assur-
ance, I think, that made his business pro-
gress so jolty. A journalist by profession,
he was editing at the commencement of our
acquaintance the Haberdashers’ Herald.
The circumstances in which he left it for
the Brewers’ Budget and that for the
Drysalters’ Digest I cannot for the
moment remember. It was about a year
after my marriage that he decided to shalm
off the dust of the city and accept control
of the Woollabup Banner.
Of Millicent Wimpole suffice it to say
that she lacked those qualities that seem to
me most essential in a woman, as well as
the facial charm that had so intrigued me
in Caroline. That she was a fond mother
cannot be denied —she was inordinately fond.
Heaven forbid that I should speak with
rancor of a child, but I abhorred the lad.
A pale and puffy boy, Rupert, with a rude
and hectoring manner; a greedy boy and
mischievous, prone to fouling his mother’s
freshly-polished windows and dropping
plum-stones down the bath exhaust; who
nevertheless constituted such an achieve
ment in the eyes of my sister-in-law that
for portraits of him one needed but to refer
to the nearest newspaper. “Another of
Blubbers’ Bonnie Babies” one encountered,
and beneath it Rupert, clad carelessly in
tulle. The Freetoid people were featuring
him with his scooter, I remember, and he
had just been photographed for the senes
“Don’t Deny Your Little Ones Their
Prunettes” when the call came to the bush.
It is one of Millicent’s illusions that
Rupert is highly strung, and that to this
nervous sensibility are due the disturbances
that affect his digestive system. My views
on this point I have hesitated to express
even to Caroline, for she resents anything
smacking of a slur on the lad. Her affec-
tion for him is undeniable —the Slightest
mishap leaves her trembling. When, there-
fore, news came from the Wimpoles that
Rupert’s condition was such as seriously to
disturb them, she straightway disposed her-
self for a journey. That my holidays should
just then have been imminent was unfor-
tunate, for with Rupert convalescent no-
thing must satisfy my relatives but that I
should make the trip also, and accept their
hospitality until after the Wooilabup Show,
The railway has still to be linked with
Wooilabup, and one is set down at Pilcher’s
Siding. In summer especially the run is
tedious, and as I flung myself into the Con-
veyance with which My brother-in-law had
met me and marked in the distance the town-
ship quivering in the heat, the prospect
of a shower was not one to be sneezed at.
Nothing, I think, is more disconcerting
than the occasional seizure of a person of
Herbert Wimpole’s type by what he _ con-
ceives to be the comic. For almost a minute
the man was well-nigh helpless; then he
controlled his sniggerings sufficiently to ex-
plain that water was water in Wooilabup,
and that in relation to one’s ablutions a Cer-
tain parsimony was essential. lie might,
however, scrape up a couple of dippers—-the
Show was getting hear, and his parsnips
were looking anything but robust.
This incident annoyed me, and I would
have retorted with some acerbity had hot
the horse, over which his control was
patently indifferent, stopped at this moment
at sight of a SUlky approaching us around
a bend.
“MrS, CieWthOrpe,” he. commented, the
vehicle having passed aiid a large lady of
florid complexion acknowledged our salute.
“Women’s committee. The only one Milli-
cent’s afraid of. Gets the trophy this year
if she pulls off the preserves. Cookery sec-
tion, y’know—the Show.” Upon which sub-
ject he descanted until dwellings fringed the
road, and with a spasm of repugnance I
discerned my nephew swinging on a gate.
I had never, I say, felt aught but abhor-
rence for the boy, but there stirred in me
at that moment a loathing which I grew less
patient of dissembling as the days went by.
Condemned now to an almost constant prox-,
imity, I became victim to a nervous irrita-
tion bordering on hysteria. The days were
sufficiently intolerable —the resources that
Wooilabup offer to the idle are few. But
the evenings—with Millicent and her recipes,
with Wimpole and his catarrhal cheroots,
with Rupert and his violin ! For the polite
ejaculations with which visitors would
acknowledge his unspeakable performances
on the fiddle had fostered in the Wimpoles
a belief that there was music in the lad, and
in the contest for juvenile instrumentalists
which was to constitute an important item
of the Show, he was to execute certain Scot-
tish airs and a selection from “Faust.”
Save an aptitude for the accordion, an
agent at best a little rude, I lack any talent
for musical expression, but my ear is not
untutored, and music has always had for
me the most remarkable appeal. In the
stringed instruments —the sob of the ’cello,
the plaintive mote of the violin —I find
especial solace. May God forgive that igno-
rant lad his sawings and his raspings, his
parents their countenance of expressions so
profane!
I could have suffered his behavior at table,
revolting as it was. I could have accus-
tomed myself in a measure to such jests as
the knotting of my suspenders and the inser-
tion of wood-lice in my shoes. But his mal-
treatment of the fiddle ! There were times
when I could gladly have done the lad the
gravest physical hurt.
It was during one of Mrs. Clewtliorpe’s
visits that there was brought home to me
the morally debilitating effect of a repressed
antipathy. There accompanied Mrs. Clew-
thorpe on this occasion her son Percy, whose
games in the garden with my nephew I was
desultorily observing while the ladies dis-
coursed on the making of melon-jam.

boaters, simply trimmed with an artificial
crab-apple or so; to few words, to compres-
sions of the lips and sniffings and elevations
of the eyebrows. From the angle of eleva-
tion of my seat on the verandah there was
something a little fascinating about this
play of Mrs. Clewthorpe’s features, now hid-
den, now partly revealed, by the tumult of
her breathing. I was engaged with this
phenomenon when sounds of altercation re-
directed my notice out of doors.
In the Clewthorpe boy one had the very
antithesis of Rupert—a beefy but frank-
faced lad of sturdy physique. By what
means Rupert had provoked him I never
learnt, but the provocation had clearly been
ill-advised, for, by way of protest, ho had
flung my relative in a puddle, and with the
mud there available was endeavoring to
plug his opponent’s ears and mouth.
It is significant of the state to which
my hatred had reduced me that I did not
immediately go to the hapless lad’s assist-
ance. For some moments, on the contrary,
I indulged emotions shameful to confess.
Not, indeed, until the outraged child had
struggled bo his feet, to rush bawling and
slobbering to the parlor, did I start from
my seat.
The sight that he presented was certainly
appalling. Passion and large gobs of earth
made him totally incoherent. He indicated
the author of his injuries with baleful mouth-
ings. Even Millicent hesitated to approach
him for a moment —even Mrs. Clewthorpe
was stimulated bo manifestation of alarm.
But in the Clewthorpe boy a berserk rage
still smouldered, and one sought in vain
for any symptom of remorse. Pride of at-
tainment marked his whole bearing. Ilis
sole regret, one gathered, concerned the
paucity of mud. Which attitude lie main-
tained right up to being bundled into the
sulky for more adequate correction in the
privacy of the Clewthorpe home.
* * * #
Like those preceding, the iday of the
Show dawned fine and ominously warm. We
were all of us early astir—it could have
been scarcely daybreak when my brother-
in-law rose to fix up his exhibition brocoli
and beetroot, and put the final polish ion
his leader, “Another Year of Rural Pro-
gress.” It was to be a busy day for the
Banner, and it struck me that he looked
pale and overwrought.
I was not to meet him again until the
afternoon. I would have a sufficiency iof
the Show, said Caroline, if I attended after
lunch—meanwhile there was the packing of
Millicent’s exhibits and their conveyance to
the School of Arts. For it was here that
the judging of the cookery section was to
take place. It was not the best of arrange-
ments, but such was the pressure of
his Parliamentary engagements, said a
late advice from the member for Wool-
labup, that it would be quite impos-
sible to catch the earlier train; and as his
wife was to act as adjudicator it had been
thought best to collect the exhibits in the
cloak-room, and let the judging follow the
HER TURN NOW.
BERT: “And, darling, do give me your answer
-don't hold me in suspense any longer."
GERT : “ That's all very well; you don’t think
of the time you've kept me in suspense.”
musical contest that was to form the feature
of the evening.
Caroline’s judgment had been eminently
sound, for as the afternoon advanced the
atmosphere grew steadily more stifling, and
the effluvia of the Showground more difficult
to support. By 3 o’clock I was quite pros-
trated. and gladly left my brother-in-law—
a little embittered by a setback with his
vegetables—to the remainder of the events.
Nor were the sickly confines ot the School of
Arts cloak-room very much more inviting.
A storm was certainly brewing—Mrs. Clew-
thorpe remarked it as she polished a jar ot
guava conserve and removed a blanc-mange
from Rupert’s reach.
In their arrangement of the cookery sec-
tion Mrs. Clewthorpe and her colleague
certainly had cause for pride—it was attrac-
tive enough under daylight conditions, but
when on our return to the hall in the even-
ing Herbert Wimpole put a match to the
Japanese lanterns, and set a few fairy lights
here and there, it presented a sight exquisite
indeed. The entries had been exceptionally
heavy—in the scone-and-damper classes quite
the heaviest for years. So far as her rock-
buns were concerned, Millicent seemed pretty
secure, but there was more doubt about her
pickled gherkins; while in the preserves
and pastry, it was very evident that Mrs.
Clewthorpe would make the running close.
That my sister-in-law was a little flurried
by the issue was manifest. She was doubt-
ful, she remarked as we adjourned to the
now crowded hall, if she had been wise in
so lightly committing herself to so severe a
nervous strain.
The place was positively packed, and when
old Mr. Duggett, to retire that ’evening after
19 years’ presidency of the show, escorted
the member and his wife to the platform,
and little Myrtle Duggett presented to the
lady a bouquet, while the Woollabup Glee
Club broke by way of welcome into “The
Larboard Watch,” the excitement was in-
tense.
Mrs. Moseley Twaddle’s speech was brief, but
most felicitous. Hindered only a little by a
cleft in the palate, she spoke of the home, of the
woman and the home, and finally of the
women of Woolabup, who, by fostering such
exhibitions as that which she was presently
to judge, were performing a signal service,
not only to their town and to the Shire of
Oodapilli, but to the country of which they
were all so proud, and to the grand old
flag.
It was a stirring moment—even Caroline,
who is by no means an emotional woman,
was affected. The only discordant note was
that struck by a person at the back of the
hall, who sought with some rudeness the
member’s views in relation to the junior-
primary industries, and the meaning of his
remarks at the recent Squab-raisers’ Con-
gress. Then came another rendition by the
Glee Club and the commencement iof the
children’s contest.
It was during the contest that Rupert
found occasion to further the project which
it now seems to me probable he had been
considering all the evening. He had con-
tributed the items already alluded to, and
the programme was almost concluded when
his seat was observed to be vacant, and at
his mother’s behest I set out to discover his
whereabouts.
• It was to the cloak-room that. I instinc-
tively directed my footsteps first. The
lamps had been lowered, and the lights in
the lanterns temporarily extinguished, and
for a moment my conjectures seemed at
fault. I was about to turn on my heel
when there came from the farther corner
the sound of lowered voices, and half-hidden
by a tier of bottled fruit I saw —two
figures.
I am reasonably satisfied as to the motive
that had drawn to that spot my nephew
Rupert. Whether the Clewthorpe boy’s
motive was predatory also, whether the meet-
ing was preconcerted, or whether there had
stirred in the stouter lad some prescience of
menace bo his mother’s handiwork, I cannot
say. Nor can I say what had precipitated
the verbal engagement to which I had
chanced to become privy. I only know that
as I looked there came from the boy Clew-
thorpe a sneering laugh and a word that
whipped my relative to a frenzy.
The exact significance of the term “jelly-
guts” I have still to learn, but that it is
one of opprobrium there seems to be little
doubt. For a space the most forbidding ex-
pression contorted my nephew’s features, and
his frame seemed to tremble with the violence
of his rage. And, quite beside himself, he
did a thing the thought of which affects me
even as I write. Snatching up a large
Viennese cream sandwich, he flung it full in
his opponent’s face !
Never shall I forget the scene that ensued.
Horror glued my feet as the lads lurched
this way and that, naught but their scuf-
flings, their labored respirations, the occa-
sional crunch of the foods dislodged from the
neighboring tables breaking the horrid
silence. Again the passion to insinuate
foreign matter into Iris antagonist’s ears
seemed to consume the boy Clewthorpe—lost
to all thought of the future, lie scooped up
large handfuls of the mess bestrewing the
floor. Casting my nephew finally from him,
he breathed the hated epithet again, hurled
at his enemy a jelly by way of souvenir,
threw up the adjacent window and was gone.
Shaken beyond expression, I was aware for
some seconds only of the ticking of the clock.
Came presently consciousness of mufHed
sounds of applause, of scraping chairs and
shuffling feet; of a sudden sharpening of
these sounds, of voices clearly distinguishable
LOVE IN A TOYSHOP.
MISS WOODEN DOLL : “The hussy! And when I first knew her she didn't have a rap
to her hack!"
and a glare of light; and, framed in the
amber oblong of the doorway, of the mem-
ber’s lady and Mrs. Clewthorpe and the
first of the influx from the hall.
It had been Mrs. Clewthorpe’s intention, I
believe, as head of the women’s committee, to
disburden herself at this juncture of a few
phrases of introductory comment. She had
commenced to do so, indeed, when she per-
ceived at her feet the mangled shape of a
cream-horn.
Her sudden check had the effect of choking
the doorway. But only momentarily. Prey
now to emotions only to be surmised, she tot-
tered forward, while I shrank into the shadow
of the bottled fruit until opportunity should
offer to mingle with the crowd. My heart
bled for the woman as I watched. Again
she paused, and again she tottered forward.
And then, with an effect singularly pathetic,
she gave a little whimper of dismay.
And from the open window came a sudden
humid draught, and from a neighboring shelf
a jar of sweet onions toppled stupidly to the
floor, and from the corner into which he had
been flung emerged the blubbering form of
my nephew, evidence of his connection with
the wreck all over his food-befouled face.
I am aware that I should now have sprung
forward and announced the doings I had seen.
Certainly nothing less could have saved the
lad—such wit as remained to him prompted
him but to denials that angered his judges the
more. Yet never did I more happily hold
my tongue. It was by virtue of my silence
that there was revealed to the world the real
mettle of Herbert AVimpole, and there came
to him the opportunity constituting the turn-
ing-point in his life.
Only for an instant did he hesitate, and
from habit seek counsel in my sister-in-law’s
eyes. Then, with a word that I have heard
on his lips neither before nor since, he
grasped with a firm hand the collar of his
offspring. Nothing could have been more
dignified than his removal of the lad to the
verandah, nothing more courteous than his
borrowing of a riding-switch en route. And
nothing, if the bawlings of the boy were of
any significance, could have been more work-
manlike than his method of administering that
so long overdue reproof.
It was a moment quite defying description
except by another row of stars.
The Wimpoles are still in the country. By
his timely tribute to public feeling Herbert
Wimpole has earned for himself the confidence
of Woollabup and established himself with
the Banner so successfully that his associa-
tion with that journal seems destined to last
for many years.
And the rudeness of Rupert, they say,
grows daily less pronounced,

FRANK MIDDLEMISS.
Morning.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE dawn, slumber scorning,
Draws its curtains apart,
And the joy of the morning
Bursts into my heart.
Its fragrant breath brings me
The scent of fresh flowers,
And its laughing voice sings me
The zest of glad hours.
I hear laughter shaking
The trees as they sway;
There is joy in the waking
To the glory of day.
Yet -when night comes, sadly,
AVith weariness deep,
I'll leave the day gladly
For silence and sleep.
So Life, too, will vanish,
Like day, to its rest,
When slumber shall banish
All care from my breast.
Perhaps if the story
Of life is not vain,
I’ll wake to the glory
Of morning again.
But small care I’m giving.
This knowledge I keep—
For life there is living;
For weariness, sleep.

The Spirit That Aims To Do
Things Better
Than They Have Ever Been Done Before
Has Produced the
‘Ambassadors ”
When the enterprise was formulated that has culminated in
the creation of “The Ambassadors” it was the aim of its
protagonists to build a place that would vie with the loveliest
centres of recreation in the greatest cities of the World.
AN IDEAL ACCOMPLISHED.
“The Ambassadors” stands now as an ideal accomplished, as it
lias taken form over the long period of construction every detail
has been studied to attain nothing less than the realisation of a
flawless ideal.
SPACIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL.
“The Ambassadors” will offer the essence of hospitality to the
spirit of joy. Its very appearance invites gaiety. Always in
readiness with the opportunity to dance will be the shining floor
of wide spaciousness, set on steel springs that make each move-
ment an unwearying delight, especially when
THE NEW YORK HAVANA BAND
discourses modern melodies. Australia has never heard jazz
music raised to the plane of artistry as it Avill hear it when the
New York Havana Band begins its engagement at “The
Ambassadors.” This Band comes to “The Ambassadors” from
The Savoy Hotel, London, and London’s loss is Sydney’s gain.
DINNER AT “THE AMBASSADORS”
Will represent the perfect social event unmarred by any jarring
note. Six European Chefs —masters of their art —will bring
to the cuisine of “The Ambassadors” the quality of distinction,
while trained experts will give to the service a final quality of
finished perfection.
COMPLETE ENJOYMENT THE YEAR ROUND
will be not only possible but inevitable at “The Ambassadors.”
A wonderful system of scientific ventilation has been installed
whereby the temperature is kept at a pleasant, equable level at
all times, whatever the thermometer may say outside.
The Opening Date will shortly
be announced.

■"THE GIPPSLAND LAKES (LAKE TYERS) Lakes Entrance,
* 195 miles from Melbourne on the coast in South-Eastern
Victoria, is reached by rail and river steamer via either Bairns-
dale or Sale, and is a popular centre from which the whole
of the beautiful Lakes District may be enjoyed. Motor boats
and cars ply to the places of interest, the Buchan Caves and
Lake Tyers being specially attractive.
MOUNT BUFFALO, famous for its winter sports and summer
pastimes, is popular at all times of the year. It is situated
in North-Eastern Victoria, 206 miles from Melbourne, and is
reached by rail and motor car in summer, and—on account of its
altitude and snow conditions —by rail and coach in winter The
Government Chalet for the accommodation of visitors is very
large and thoroughly up-to-date.
A TYPICAL SCENE in
the charming hill country
near Melbourne. There are
many resorts within 50 miles
of Melbourne adjacent to the
Healesville, Warburton, Gem-
brook, Whittlesea and Hurst-
bridge lines, where a pleasant
day, week-end, or longer holi-
day may be enjoyed.
LORNE (TEDDY’S LOOK-OUT), no miles from Melbourne, on the
South-Western Coast, is reached by rail and motor car. It is a
resort of infinite charm, and the visitors that throng it during the season
find enjoyment on its sunny beaches, along its rocky headlands, or about
its many waterfalls and delightful fern glades, which are all within easy
walking distance of the township.
TpHE GRAMPIANS (THE PINNACLE) —In Western Victoria, an hour
* and a half’s motor run from Stawell, which is 150 miles from Melbourne
on the main line to Adelaide. Wild and rugged, with great frowning preci-
pices and beetling rock masses, these mountains always appeal strongly to
the tourist, and they are especially alluring in the Spring when beautiful
wild flowers bloom in amazing profusion.
