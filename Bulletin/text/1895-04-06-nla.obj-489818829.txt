Some Recent Books.
East Lynne, Mrs. Henry Wood’s best-known
book, is now published in a neat cheap
edition ; cloth, 2s 4d.
Beyond the Dreams of Avarice, Walter
Besant’s new novel, belongs to the respect-
able family class of fiction. The old
motives and situations are furbished up
again, and there is a nice, satisfactory end-
ing. Cloth, 6s.
The Indiscretion of the Duchess is a short
story by Anthony Hope, of no particular
interest or value. Paper, Is 3d.
The Ralstons, Marion Crawford’s last book,
is a sequel to “Katherine Lauderdale,”
and has rather more interest, though the
writer does not reach the level of his
early books. Paper, 2s lOd ; cloth, 3s lOd.
The People of the Mist, by Rider Haggard,
takes one again into strange and adven-
turous country, and the story goes with
some swing and vigor. Haggard is out-of-
date nowadays, but those who admired
King Solomon’s Mines should also admire
The People of the Mist, which is brightened
by many illustrations. Paper, 2s lOd.
The Wonderful Mission of Earl Lavender,
by John Davidson, is a prose fantasia
which will seem rather foolish to the aver-
age reader, and not very wise to the
adept. Earl Lavender certainly has a
grand idea for a new Evolution, which
enables you to eat and drink freely at
your neighbor’s expense ; but the applica-
tion of the idea is made none the easier
by the Earl’s experience. The feature of
the book is the description of a London
society of flagellants, weary of natural
interests, and seeking an unnatural
stimulus in the pleasant dissipation of
whipping one another’s bare backs. Cloth,
6s 6d.
A Journalist’s Note-Book, by Frank Frank-
fort Moore, is a book of gossipy reminis-
cences, with many good stories new and
old. The price (cloth, 6s lid) is rather
high for a book of ephemeral interest, at
all events from the Australian point of
view.
Corrected Impressions, by George Saints-
bury (cloth, 7s lid) is a collection of
literary appreciations by the English critic
who perhaps of all others comes closest to
the pinnacled Saint-Beuve. Thackeray,
Temiyson, Carlyle, Swinburne, Macaulay,
Browning, Dickens, Matthew Arnold, Wm.
Morris, Ruskin, and “ three mid-century
novelists” (George Eliot, Charlotte Bronte,
and Anthony Trollope) are all cleverly
treated ; and the book has many grateful
thoughts for a lover of literature.

Discords, by George Egerton. This is a
companion volume to “ Keynotes,” and
unquestionably strong, though the con-
tinual stress on the same sex-note grows
monotonous. As for the “ wickedness”-
the candour of the intimate references to
married life (in “Virgin Soil,” for ex-
ample) has rarely been matched outside of
medical works. Mr. Besant’s Young
Person shudders, no doubt; but she reads
all the same, and the book sells furiously.

THE "KEEPER" PILE PILL
(Registered).
The PROPRIETORS of these Pills are well aware that
there are many remedies (some of them really beneficial)
for this painful disease already in the market, but know-
ing as they do the wonderful success of the “ KEEPER ”
PILL they have no hesitation in placing it in the very
front rank of Curative Medicines.
For years the medicine had only a local and limited
use, but now arrangements have been completed to make
its merits more widely known, and the Australasian
colonies will have an opportunity of sharing with the old
country the benefits of this valuable remedy.
The medicine will be sold on its merits, in confident
assurance that its beneficent action will be a real boon to
sufferers.
It will not cure Piles in old and chronic oases by a single
dose. It will not cure every disease that flesh is heir to,
hut it Will cin e Piles if taken in reasonable time, and
IT WILL GIVE RELIEF IN ALL OASES,
however stubborn and chronic, and the proprietors are
continually in receipt of most flattering and unsolicited
testimonials. Price, 2 6 per box (red label).
The “KEEPER” LIVER PILL.
We constantly find cases of Hemorrhoids whloh are
•omplica'ted with liver trouble, and we have therefore
perfected a Ln er Pill to be used alone, or in conjunction
with the “Ki eper” Pile Pill. We do not claim tor this,
or for any of our preparations, any marvellous curative
properties. We simply advise you, if suffering from slug-
gish or torpid liver, to spend 1/3 in a box of “ KEEPER ”
LIVER PILLS (blue label) and you will not regret it.
The “KEEPER” HEALTH PILL.
If you are worried in business, if you are jaded by over-
work, if vou are generally run down from any cause, TRY
THIS PILL. It is a prince of pick-me-ups. In one size
only (brown label), 6 6 per box.
The title the “KEEPER” PILL is registered as our
trade mark throughout the colonies, and any infringement
thereof will be promptly dealt with by the sole proprietors

A BIG BIZI
Our Trade is Big 1 Our Store is Big !
Our Ideas are Big I
We get bigger every day; on Saturday nigbt
we are bigger than on the previous Monday,
and on the Wednesday following we are bigger
■still. We can’t help growing. We have all the
elements of growth. The soil we are planted in
is good, the climate propitious, the people kind.
We are continually watered by the lifegiving
showers of a nation’s approval. Can anyone
wonder that we grow?
Our growth is a wonderful thing. People
describe it as magical. There is no magic in it.
Anyone, or any set of people, can do the same if
they do as we have done. But they don’t; they
can’t find the way, charge too much for the privi-
lege of doing business with them, and generally
and deplorably make a mess of the whole affair.
That’s the mischief.
Most People Like Us! All Believe in Us!
Not a Pew Swear by Us!
It’s cupboard love. We suit them, make their
money go a long way, and generally render the
path of life an easy one. There’s no sentiment
about it. It’s real biz, and no mistake. In that
way we are beloved throughout Australia, the
measure of affection each one bestows upon us
being gauged by the amount of benefit received.
The more you buy at our store the greater your
liking for us will become, because the more you
invest with us the better dividends you receive.
If living IN THE COUNTRY, send for our
Catalogue and Patterns of anything you require ;
if in town, call every day.

‘A GOLDEN SHANTY.’
Their Last Death .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Last will and testament of Jessie Perkins, aged
about 35, who committed suicide by suffocating
lierself with the fumes of charcoal at South Mel-
bourne, Victoria, A.u. 1895 :
Blessed Father, loving Saviour, I humbly ask Thy
loving- mercy and pardon for the deed I am going to do.
I have not been able to get any work to do. I have not a
penny in the house, and am deep in debt; and to see my
darling aged mother turned out into the cold street with-
out any money, and not to have any place to put her dear
head on to—oh, God! it is more than I can bear! Blessed,
loving Saviour, it is with an aching heart that I write
these few lines, and with eyes that can scarcely see for
tears. Dear Lord and Saviour, have mercy on our poor
souls. Pity and protect us, and receive our poor souls
into peace'and comfort; and may we meet my dear angel
brothers in Heaven again. Dear Lord, have mercy upon
us, and may Thy blessed Spirit have mercy and grant us
that blessed mercy and heavenly grace, and that loving
pardon that we do humbly pray for. Have mercy upon,
and may our souls rest in peace. Amen.
Hear this weird refrain repeated up to Heaven, as
it swells;
Hear the quaint, pathetic echo of the merry New
Year bells:
“ Saviour mild, who meekly journeyed with Thy
cross to Calvary,
I am woeful, wistful, weary—take Thou now my
cross from me.”
Hark ! the howling of the demons in the near and
nether hells,
Cursing Earth and earthly patience in the clang
of New Year bells,
Claiming souls of shrieking men-kind, shrinking
souls of women fair.
Claiming souls of starving women, dumbly driven
to despair !
Hark! the prayer for peace and pity, faintly,
fondly, how it swells
Up to far, eternal Justice, ’midst the clang of
New Year bells ;
Hear the strange, weak, plaintive pleading of this
creature with its god,
Hear it? Yea ! and may it smite us in our blind-
ness like a rod !
Hear it? Yea ! and may they hear it —hear, and
pale before it, too,
When the great awakening coraeth and the rifle-
shots ring through ;
Hear it ?—No ! they will not hear it, ’tis too faint,
and far and small,
These were only “common” people who have
suffered —that is all !
Common folks ; a common story, save the end,
which smacks of tears —
Many die, but e’en as they did —maybe one in
many years.
Busy world—which needs sensations—drops lip-
pity as it reads.
Passes on to “ stocks and markets,” life hath also
other needs.
First the bank, which failed, and left them —
genteel paupers—in the slums.
Glad to toil for Dives, thankful for the largesse
of his crumbs,
Glad to sell that vassal service—just as glad as
you and I
Are to vend our souls and bodies when we find
the one to buy.
Turned to weary music teaching—here is fitting
food for laugh,
Let them write the satire largely on the self-
.slain’s cenotaph—
How her whole discordant being, doomed in dark-
ness, aye to be,
Quivered ’midst the chords harmonic of some
master’s symphony.
“Times grew bad and teaching failed her” —runs
the modern legend—“ ’till
She was forced to making lollies and to vend
them.” Still
Spectre Hunger mowed and gibbered, closer,
closer yet it drew—
Then the last despairing effort and the mortgage,
and the Jew !
“ Merry Christmas ” came and left them in their
proud seclusion there;
“ Happy New Year ” rose and mocked, them from
some far-off revel where
Food and wine were freely lavished, lights were
glancing, laughter fell—
Echoed dream of distant Heaven wafted down
through space to hell!
Then they turned to one another—aged mother,
aching child,
Spoke of “ Death ” and “ Sin ” and “ Duty ” and
the codes by man compiled
For his soul’s express salvation, for his Ego’s
future good,
When his house becomes a grave-pit and his
raiment rotting wood.
What was Death that they should dread it, food-
less, loveless, hopeless, proud ?
What to them the narrow dwelling and the coffin
and the shroud ?
What had that to add of torture or uncertainty or
strife,
When each sun that climbed to zenith glittered
down on Death in Life ?
Glittered down at last on Silence—gleamed from
golden dawn to gloom,
Still on Silence ! Silence ! Silence ! in that dark,
close-fastened room;
Glittered down, oh God Eternal, morn and noon
and haunted night,
On a Something, still and tragic, on a gaunt and
ghastly sight:
Glittered down while men and women in a laugh-
ing, living tide
Flowing out and flowing inward, swept the level
pave outside —
Glittered down but not to gladden, or to sadden,
or to touch
Two at least of all the thousands who have
“ sinned and suffered much.”
Hear, again, the message pleading through her
anguish and her fears,
Penned to Him—who also suffered—when “her
eyes were full of tears ” !
Hear again the dying daughter of a mother doubly
dead,
Praying God’s eternal justice that they “ might
be comforted ” !
Hark the quaint, pathetic echo of our merry New-
Year bells,
That from out “a land of plenty” up to God
Almighty swells ;
“ Blessed Father, loving Saviour, hear my last
fond, fervent prayer,
Debt and Hunger ! Pardon, Father— it is more
than I can bear.”

The New South Wales Local Government
Bill.
That Local Government Bill for which New
South Wales has been patiently waiting
the last thirty years or more has at length
come to hand, and the province’s reward is
by no means commensurate with its patience.
For a generation, or thereabouts, the public
men of New South Wales are understood to
have been pondering over this great question.
It has been constantly before them all that
time, and, meanwhile, Queensland, Victoria,
Maoriland and other provinces had Local
Government systems of their own in active
operation, and the politicians of the old,
slow-going mother-province had every oppor-
tunity to study these, and discover, by the
experiences of their neighbors, how to con-
struct asystem which would combine all the
best, and none of the worst, features of those
already in existence. Tne result of so much
study and so much valuable example should
have been something better than the average.
Therefore, it is disappointing to find that
Premier Reid’s Bill is about the weakest
and most unfinished affair of its kind
that could well be imagined. The things
that are in it are altogether remarkable, and
the things that are left out of it are still
more remarkable, and the whole scheme
vaguely suggests that it was compiled in
haste, with a broken pencil, on the back of
an old envelope, and then thrown on the
table of the House to take its chance, what-
ever that might be.
• * #
The Bill itself con tainsa comparatively small
part of the scheme. Most of the essential
provisions are embodied in a series of bye-
laws by which it is accompanied, and which,
being apart from the Bill itself, cannot be
amended in any way by Parliament. The
measure simply gives power to the Governor-
in-Council to issue regulations at his own
blessed discretion and that of the Cabinet,
which regulations shall have the force of law
and shall cover at least three fourths of the
whole subject, and Parliament is asked to
sanction all these regulations in advance—
whatever they may be. Also, when the
various Local Government bodies are formed,
each one of them is to have the power—sub-
ject to the approval of the Governor and the
Cabinet—to alter these regulations as it shall
see fit. The regulations deal with the mode
of electing councillors, qualification of coun-
cillors, qualification of electors, collection of
rates, method of keeping accounts, expendi-
ture of funds, audit, and many other sub-
jects. By giving each local body power to
amend this code of by-laws, therefore, it
may come to pass that in one district the
first elected councillors may be all rich land-
lords who will forthwith proceed to enact
that none but landholders shall be eligible
for membership. And, meanwhile, in the
district alongside, the council may be
swamped by trades-unionists, who may so fix
things that only the horny-handed son of toil
shall have a say in the management of affairs.
The Local Government bodies are not only
to administer the law, they are also to make
a new law for themselves ; and they will pro-
bably keep diverging from the original plan
until there are 40 different Local Government
systems instead of one. No province in its
senses wants so much Local Government as
this, nor does it want to inflate the local
authority into a law-maker. The average
local authority is sufficiently inflated as it is.
* # #
Among the principal objects of Local
Government are the relief of the public
revenue by causing all purely local works to
to be executed out of local rates, the aboli-
tion of the “department trotter,” and the
extinction—or partial extinction—of that
nefarious system by which the Ministry is
enabled to buy the support of the electorates
with roads and bridges and culverts and
gaols and similar “benefits.” Therefore, it
is depressing to notice that Premier Reid’s
Bill does not promise to relieve the general
revenue, that it furnishes new and glorious
facilities for the same old “department
trotter,” and that it leaves the gate open for
the same old system of Ministerial bribery as
heretofore. Under the existing Act, general
rates may be levied up to Is. in the £ on the
annual rental value of property within the
municipality, and special rates not exceeding
Is. in the £ may also be levied, making a
total of 2s. Also, it provides for an annual
endowment from the national Treasury of
20s. in the £ for the first five years after the
municipality is established ; of 10s. in the
next five years, and of ss. in the succeeding
five years. After fifteen years the endow-
ment is to cease entirely, and, in the case of
many of the N.S.W. municipalities, that
period has long since expired. The new
Bill provides that general rates may vary in
the case of shires from a minimum of half-a-
farthing to a maximum of three farthings in
the £ on the unimproved value, or from a
minimum of 6d. to a maximum of Is. 3d. in
the £ on the annual value. The minimum
in the one form of rating is thus one-sixth in
the maximum, and, in the other case, two-
fifths, and one minimum is more than twice
as large as the other. A special rate is per-
mitted to the same extent. In the case of
municipalities, the same general rate is pre-
scribed, but no special rate is definitely
provided for, and, as very few municipali-
ties can keep solvent on a tax of Is.
3d. in the £, serious trouble may be
expected. Also, all municipalities, dis-
tricts, and shires are to be endowed indis-
criminately, beginning at the first-class
borough which is endowed for 15 years
certain, at a rate which begins at 10s. in the
£, down to the fourth-class shire which is
endowed for 30 years certain, and for the
first five years receives 60s. in the £ per
annum on all rates collected.
« * *
Under these circumstances, Local Govern-
ment promises to be expensive. There is no
provision in the Act to define what is a
fourth-class shire or any other class of shire,
or to distinguish among first, second, or
third-class municipal districts, or first or
second-class boroughs. Therefore, every
shire will try to be a fourth-class shire, and
every municipal district will do its best to be
a third-class municipal district, and every
borough will use its utmost endeavours to be
a second-class borough, so as to get the
largest possible endowment. And, as the
settlement of these matters is left entirely to
the Ministry, the road-and-bridge politician
will button-hole the Government in the
good old way, and sell his vote to get his
own district put in the class which gets the
biggest endowment, and the corrupt or time-
serving Minister will buy support by shifting
the district which votes straight into the
best-endowed class. Also, the proposal to
lavishly endow first-class boroughs is pure
foolishness. The allowance of 10s. in the £
to be paid to the cities and 15s. to towns,
most of which are already incorporated, is
not shifting a burden from the national to
the local revenue, but transferring a great
part of the burden now borne by the local
rates back again to the State Treasury. A
certain amount will be saved by compelling
the poor and remote parts of the province
to incorporate themselves and pay a part of
their own charges out of local rates, and the
amount of this saving will be wasted in
endowing the richer districts on a vastly
more lavish scale than heretofore. This is
the ordinary process of local government
turned upside down, and is cumbersome
and ridiculous to boot. The inhabitants of
the empty West are to be endowed,
partly at their own expense, and partly
at the expense of the city population,
and the people of the cities are to be
endowed, partly at the expense of the
remote country districts and chiefly at the
expense of themselves. Also, the necessity
for the endowment arises greatly because
the land-tax, which is the chief legitimate
source of revenue of the local bodies, is
limited to a ridiculously low figure, and it is
so limited, apparently, because the Govern-
ment proposes to tax the same land a second
time for the purposes of the national
revenue, and the amount raised by this
second land-tax will have to be handed
back to supplement the deficiencies of the
first land-tax. All of which is a fearful and
interesting complication.
# # *
The new Bill is full of curious anomalies
which should gladden the hearts of many
lawyers in the hereafter. The attached
regulations provide for a plural property
vote on a large and most objectionable
scale, the maximum allowed being four
votes, and the Bill itself provides a severe
penalty against anyone voting, or attempting
to vote, twice at one election, quite regard-
less of the fact that a right to vote four times
is distinctly permitted. The Bill provides
for the division of the province into boroughs,
municipal districts and shires, and furnishes
elaborate definitions of the two latter, to-
gether with rules for their establishment and
government, but leaves the boroughs wholly
undefined. Further, it provides that all the
unincorporated portion of the province shall
be at once formed into shires, and a few
pages further on it declares that any part of
it may be formed into municipal districts.
It provides for the endowment ot boroughs,
municipal districts, and shires, and sets forth
that the receipt of the President of the shire
shall be a sufficient acknowledgment when the
money is paid, but there is no provision where-
by a borough or municipal district can give a
satisfactory receipt, so these latter will collect
their endowment with considerable difficulty.
Also, the Act purports "to repeal certain
words in section 168 of the old Municipali-
ties Act, which words are not there, and
some confusion is likely to arise in con-
sequence.
* • *
Probably the most hopelessly foolish pro-
viso in the whole Bill, however, is that
under which any 20 ratepayers may require
that a general vote shall be taken on almost
any subject under the sun, the cost of the
proceedings to come out of the local revenue.
In a large municipality, so small a num-
ber as 20 aggressive or obstructive per-
sons can always be found to keep on
demanding a general vote on all manner
of subjects, either out of pique, or mere
cussedness, or desire for advertisement,
and this proviso promises endless worry
and expense and public aggravation. The
number ought at least to bear some fixed
ratio to the ratepaying population. Also,
whereas the old Municipalities Act pro-
vided that local bodies might borrow to
the extent of five years’ rates only, which
was certainly sufficiently lavish, the new one
authorises borrowing to nearly twice this
limit. Another serious drawback is that
Premier Reid’s great work, so far as some
of its clauses are concerned, is an altogether
new Act ; and in some other clauses it
simply provides that certain words shall be
struck out of the old Municipalities Act and
certain other words inserted in their stead ;
and in other parts again it provides that
certain clauses shall be lifted bodily out of
the old Act and inserted bodily in the new
one. In consequence of which and other
circumstances it is clumsy and incomprehen-
sible, and likely to lead to much contention
and litigation. Altogether the great measure
which New South Wales has waited for so
long is'a woeful disappointment now that it
has arrived.
Principle or Plunder.
In New South Wales, at present, the pro-
verb that “ hungry dogs will eat dirty
pudding ” is revoltingly illustrated by
aspirants for office. Politicians are for once
betrayed by their desperate necessities, their
paltry ambitions, or their inflamed vanity, into
casting aside the decent garments of alleged
fidelity to principles with which they ordinarily
clothe and veil their true natures, and are
exhibiting the depravity of their minds naked
and not ashamed. The Outs are rolling over
each other in squalid plots to assassinate
the Ins, and have burst into public view',
clutching and scratching one another in furious
disagreement about the division of the antici-
pated plunder. The public owes them, for this
enlightening exhibition of themselves, no com-
mon debt of gratitude. This spectacle of the
once apostle of Freetrade feverishly stipulating
that he shall be leader of a gang, organised to
cut the throat of the cause, cannot fail to im-
press the public with the unreality and spuri-
ousness of the most solemn pretences and
asseverations of political conviction. Almost
equally enlightening is the anxiety of alleged
Protectionists to waive all attempts to replace
the paltering tariff of to-day by one truly
effectual—in consideration of being admitted to
a share in the spoils of official position. The
poet Gray neatly defines the successful methods
of a conqueror : “to wade through slaughter to
a throne.” In narrower spheres of action the
same spirit prompts men to more contemptible
exploits. They are not ashamed to wade
through disgrace to a portfolio. The country
quivers with mixed emotions of scorn, amuse-
ment and indignation at the revelations of
conspiracies baulked hy the irreconcilable greed
of the plotters. People learn with advantage
that so long as the differences to he harmonised
were confined to mere considerations of aban-
donment of principles, everything proceeded
smoothly, but that there was no reconciling
the pretensions of the bandits when it
came to arranging the apportionment of the
plunder. The Freetrade plotters were amiably
willing to permit the existing tariff to continue
for an indefinite period—a tariff" which they
have repeatedly and constantly for over three
years denounced as inflicting the most direful
injuries upon the people of the province. Pro-
tectionists who have, on the other hand, fre-
quently declared that the tariff is ineffectual to
diffuse the benefits of Protection and prejudicial
to the public appreciation of the quickening in-
fluence of a truly Protective system, have been
equally willing to allow the country to remain
tantalised by the bogus thing.
• # #
Summarised, the situation stands thus : The
ex-chief Freetrader is willing to abandon Free-
trade—for office. Sundry alleged Protectionists
are willing to abandon effectual Protection
for office; and rank and file on each
side are eager to work together—for office.
The conspiracy only breaks down because
there are not offices of profit sufficient to go
round. There are two claimants for every
position, from that of Premier to that of whip.
And, inasmuch as it is requisite to hoist some
colors other than the black flag of mere political
buccaneering, the colors of Federation are to be
elevated. Parkes, who denounces Reid for
insincerity in respect of associating with him-
self in the Cabinet Mr. Want, one of the group,
of pronounced opponents of the Federal move-
ment, publicly invites to his arms men of all*
parties on the sole ground of agreement in,
desiring to get rid of the present Cabinet as,
incompetent. Among the allies thus Sought is,
to be numbered an antagonist of Federation,
just as pronounced as Mr. Want, in the person,
of Mr. Crick.
* * *
Those Protectionists who have shown a readi-
ness to accept the proffered leadership of Sin-
Henry Parkes have a distinct advantage over
the insurrectionary contingent of Freetraders
who have lent countenance to the coalition
plot. The former, at least, would secure the
perpetuation of the present tariff. The latter,
pledged to the eyes to destroy this tariff, would
sacrifice everything which they had professed
to regard as essential to the prosperity of the
community. But what malign influence afflicts
the Protectionist cause that it should be doomed
always to entrust the direction of its political
guidance to a Freetrade renegade ? First, the
shifty Dibbs —one day “a Freetrader of the
Freetraders,” the next day a convinced Protec-
tionist ; one day a swaggering advocate of an
Australian Republic, the next the humble
recipient of a title of knighthood from the
Sovereign of Great Britain and its “ de-
pendencies.” Next, the shifty Parkes,
scarce rested from exhorting the people
of New South Wales to rise and em-
power him to sweep away every vestige of
Protection, and now inviting them to thrust
contemptuously aside the “wretched fiscal
squabble.” Only the other day claiming
the eternal gratitude of the people for his
achievement in extinguishing a feeble five per
cent, ad valorem revenue tariff, and now declar-
ing his willingness to save the country by
averting the destruction of a tariff rising to
fifteen per cent, ad valorem, and even higher ir
respect of specific duties.
# # •
Meanwhile, the situation of Ministers,,
has become decidedly less strong with,
the lapse of time. The fact appears tc.
be that while they continue to obey tjie.
impulse derived from the electors, a,, con,,
siderable and very influential contingent o| those,
who issued the mandate have changed, their-
minds. Till recently the wealthy orders—the.
commercial magnates and the owners of reali
estate—have been, almost unanimously, actively,
antagonistic to Protection. The system,
appeared to them to involve interference with,
the profits of importation. Bankers, merchants,
(only another name for importers in New South,
Wales), money-dealers and landowners com-
bined to throw the full weight of their
antagonism into the scales against Protection,.
To-day they have begun to realise—or to fancy,
they realise—what Freetrade, carried into«
practice, really involves. They learn, aghast*
that repeal of the ineffectual tariff"—ineffectual!
as regards stimulating local industry—must
involve taxation drawn from their own
pockets. They are Freetraders no longer.
They are not indeed Protectionists. They
are simply Revenue Tariffists, and as such
they beat the floor with their hoofs and make
noises with their gullets when Dibbs presents
himself at city banquets, while they receive
the Freetrade prophet Reid with chill reserve.
# # #
There can be no alliance between these;
gentry and honest Protectionist or honest Free-
trader. They have no genuine fiscal con-
victions. They are distinctly Conservative
and Fatman, and otherwise are unclassifiahle.
Their aim is to maintain conditions which shall
keep the burden of taxation upon the backs of
the masses, and prevent an ounce of weight
from being imposed upon their own shoulders.
Their defection may undermine the Reid
Cabinet. Already the Chamber which is all
their own—the Legislative CounciL-is prepar-
ing to destroy every measure of property-taxa-
tion presented to it. The greedy faction of
office-hungerers, who hope in the confusion to
possess themselves of portfolios, can only do so>
by serving the selfish aims of this class, now
actively organising, through the machinery of
the National Association, resistance to direct
taxation. If the Protectionists do not ener-
getically bestir themselves they will discover
that they have been betrayed into an alliance
with the Conservatives.
# • «
The Democracy of New South Wales may be
divided in opinion with respect to Protection
and Freetrade. But, with regard to the inci-
dence of taxation, it can never be divided by
honest conviction. Those are bogus Protec-
tionists who pretend that their principles in-
volve any repugnance to direct taxation. The;


genuine Protectionist can join hands with the
democratic Freetrader in agreement that the
expenses of the State, the maintenance of law
and order, the improvement of communications
and harbors and rivers, and bo on, must be
defrayed by citizens in proportion to the benefits
they derive from such outlays, as nearly as
legislative ingenuity can devise methods for
apportioning burdens. The ideal can never be
achieved in perfection. There is no such thing
■as perfection possible in this world. But the
ideal Protective tariff is one which produces no
revenue whatever. -The true Protectionist
.statesman would constantly strive towards that
■condition. Thus, so far as revenue-raising is
■concerned, theoretical Freetrader and theoretical
Protectionist meet on identical ground. NoCus-
itoms revenue. Consequently, direct taxation.
* * m
The true policy of Protectionists to-day
iis quite irrecoucileable with the office-greed
■or financial desperation of necessitous or
lax-principled politicians. The existing tariff
has, notoriously, inflicted infinite discredit
inpon the Protectionist cause. It has created
mo appreciable employment. It has called into
(existence no industrial establishments. Away
with it, at all hazards ! Better that the
jpeople who feel instead of reasoning should
learn by bitter experience what a free-port
ireally signifies to them. For, although this
stariff has not created much employment, it has,
ito some extent, maintained it. Let the people
■of New South Wales realise what it means to
fhave the sugar industry strangled and the
Hast plank drawn from under the feet of the
ifarmers. Let Mr. Reid and his followers ex-
jperieuce the unpopularity which always re-
wards those who impose new taxation. Pro-
rbably the worst foes of Protection were the
Hast Ministry. The deadliest to Free-
(trade will be the present—if the Protec-
itionist theory be" correct. If such prove
■to be not the case; if under Freetrade
(the country be prosperous, so be it. What
matter the means so long as the end is attained?
Two years of open ports should cure the com-
munity vf all hankerings after more of the same
experience. The great desideratum is an
honest, downright trial of one system or the
other. The Dibbs Ministry dared not, or
cared not to, give a trial of genuine Protection,
Neither of the two preceding Parkes Minis-
tries dared or cared to venture on absolute
Freetrade. If Mr. Reid has the courage of his
opinions, for Heaven’s sake, and for the sake of
fiuality of some kind, let him try.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
More About the Federal Balance-Sheet
The trouble re the financial aspect of Federa-
tion still rages in the daily press, and the old
flails keep on pounding out the same old straw
unto seventy times seven. It lias now been
shown several dozen times over that it is prac-
tically impossible to prove anything in the
matter that is worth proving, but beyond that
very little has been done. The financial aspect
of Federation only becomes more chaotic with
prolonged consideration. Of the Australian
(provinces, Queensland has the heaviest, and
■Victoria tiie lightest debt, and they both want
tthese matters to be duly “considered.” Wes-
itralia lias the largest area of unsold lands ;
(Queensland claims to have the largest area of
■unsold cultivable land, and S.A. puts in a
similar claim; the other provinces have very
■little pubi c estate. Therefore, some provinces
(Would like to throw the State lands into the
(Federal treasury, and others wouldn’t. S.A. has
The only payable railway system, but its returns
■ are diminishing, and it promises soon to have a
■ deficiency. Some of the other provinces have
■insolvent railway systems which are progressing
itowards solvency, and others have insolvent
■systems which are progressing towards worse
insolvency. Some of the postal departments
have an increasing deficiency, and others have
a deficiency which is steadily diminishing,
while one—that of S.A.—shows an absolute
profit. The abolition of border customs and
the establishment of a uniform railway tariff
will enable Victoria to annex much of the trade
of southern New Soutli Wales, and South
Australia to take some of the trade of western
Victoria, and Queensland some of that of
northern New South Wales ; while the latter
province and Westralia, so far as present
appearances go, would not annex anything. All
these and several dozen other things have been
proved so often that they have become ancient
liistory. Also, the critics of Federation want
to know how an equitable system can be devised
for the distribution of surplus revenue among
the different provinces ; how the Federal
Government can be prevented from show-
ing gross favoritism by building wild-cat rail-
ways (say) in Queensland, or Westralia, or
the Northern Territory, which will become a
burden on the other provinces; how the separate
provinces can be prevented from piling up new
debts after their old liabilities have been taken
over by the Commonwealth ; and various other
conundrums. The obvious answer to which, of
course, is taat the surplus—if there is one—will
■ be apportioned in the best way possible—or,
perhaps, in the worst way—but that no abso-
, lutely perfect system can be devised ; that the
■ Federal Government will build new railways
where it “darned well pleases;” and that if the
1 provincial Governments want to borrow on their
■own account they will most likely do it. Also,
that nobody is likely to be fully satisfied with
■ the Federal arrangement, no matter how the
■finances are adjusted, and that every time the
Federal Government builds a new railway in
•one province the other provinces will curse as
'to the manner born, and there will be an ill-
Hsed feeling generally, which provincial poli-
ticians of a certain class will encourage to the
best of their ability. Further, au effort
is evidently going to be made to have it
enacted in the Federal Constitution that no
protective duties shall be levied beyond a cer-
tain fixed limit, and probably another effort
will be made to secure the insertion of othe.
provisoes regarding excise, land questions, the
referendum, &c. If these matters are embodied
in the Constitution there will be much trouble,
and there will also bh much trouble if they are
not embodied. All of which only goes to prove
that the Federal Constitution won’t be perfect,
that it can’t please everybody, and that it can’t
even wholly please anybody. And the sooner
these facts are generally understood the better.
The Bulletin, for one, expects to be able to
pick out a score of glaring iniquities in the
Federal Constitution when it arrives, but still
this paper wants it to arrive, and to arrive as
quickly as possible.
Honor Among Sharks.
Editor Bulletin, —If it is your privileged
custom to include all lawyers in one iadis-
criminating anathema, I don’t complain. If
you will, every advocate is a devil’s advocate;
every solicitor is a maw, and no more. Grant
that we are cheeked like ironclads and billed
like pelicans; that we devour the portion of
the widow and the fatherless; that our sole
value is as aids to faith, because there must be
a hell to put lawyers in. Call us moral Adams,
naked of principle and unashamed ; parasites
who give Justice an itching palm; brigands,
bandits, vultures, harpies, sharks. But,
between shark and shark, don’t deny our
etiquette of voracity; between buzzard and
buzzard, our esprit de corps. Sydney Smith
declared that when a churchman is wounded
his brethren stamp with their feet and push
with their horns, until they demolish the dis-
senter who did the mischief; but when a
lawyer is hurt the rest of the profession sur-
round him and put him to deal h. How does
this smart and shallow saying tally with the
generous consideration shown by Bench and Bar
for the feelings of a defaulting Gent. One ?
No ; ours is an honorable kind of thievery.
Though we diddle all men, we love the
brotherhood ; though we jeer God, we
honour the Ring. This fidelity to the
Brazen Rule of “ Fleece and let fleece ”
is so generally conspicuous that lawyers admit
with grief the need of Parliamentary inter-
vention, as by you advocated, in the matter of
Australian Judges whose relatives practise
before them. You argue that a legislative bar
to the administration of justice en famille would
be a public good : I know that it would remove
a professional evil. The public good is nothing
to me; but I want to seize my own good where-
ever I can find it, and Judges’ relatives bar
every path to success. Say lam a barrister.
When I choose a Court to practise in, I know
beforehand that the Judge’s sons or other rela-
tives will absorb (say) two-thirds of all avail-
able briefs. Rightly or wrongly, solicitors
think (or their clients think, which is much the
same thing) that the litigant who briefs the
Judge’s son has one leg in—or afoot, at any
rale: hence the undeniable fact that Judges’
relatives practise chiefly before their relatives,
and that they get far more briefs than their
comparative merit or standing warrants. Well,
I choose. In my first case, lam opposed to
(say) the Judge’s son or nephew. Do you think,
with the knowledge that the Judge can,make
or mar my career tingling through my head,
that I can talk to his sou or about his son
either before his face or behind his back as I
would to or about an unrelated advocate?
Suppose the sou weak, or his case. Dare I
ridicule him when he blunders, or pull a rotten
case down about his ears, when I know, or
imagine, that for every point I score against him
a point is, in the ordinary human course of
things, scored against me by his father ? If
the Judge chooses, and even if he does not
choose, he can ruin me, and that without lifting
a finger against me. He can blast my chances
(unless I happen to be a man among a thousand,
and of the stern stuff of which a Martin, or a
Salomons, or a Pilcher, or a Purves, is made)
with the flicker of an eyelash or the curl of a
lip. Let the whisper once get abroad among
the attorneys and their clients that Mr. So and-
so is an advocate unpalatable to Judge What-
his-name, and I may as well quit Judge What-
his-name’s court at once. So, when a Judge’s
sou is opposed to me, I may have sometimes to
choose between killing my case and killing my
career. The alternative is intolerable ; and the
relative-scandal is only tolerated in Australia.
In England, the swamping of special courts by
barristers claiming close kinship with the
Judge is a thing undreamt of. Whenever
attempted, the practice has been crushed
at once by the emphatic reprobation
of profession and public. Sir Richard
Webster, Attorney - General in the last
Salisbury Ministry, declared in 1891, for ex-
ample, that for a son to practise regularly
before his father was improper and opposed to
the traditions of the Bar (Law Times, June 13,
’9l). The Law Times —perhaps the most
widely-known law-journal—the Scottish Law
Review, and similar organs of professional
opinion, condemn as “objectionable,” “ano-
malous,” and “extremely objectionable” the
examples of family justice which sometimes
crop up in the minor courts. The attention of
the House of Commons was called to such cases
on July 31, ’9l, when the Attorney-General
reiterated his previous expression of opinion,
and stated that he had counselled a son who
called upon him for advice not to practise
before his father. These facts are conclusive
proof of the sentiment of the English Bar.
What that august body of buccaneers would
say were an attempt made to stuff superior
courts with Judges’ relatives, as courts are
stuffed in Australia, I have not the vaguest
idea. But I have a very definite idea what it
would do.—Yours, Shark Junior.
Hud ion. Bros.’ Strike.
The strike at Hudson Bros.’ workshops,
Sydney, is a national affair. If the men are
defeated the whole’commuuity is defeated, the
whole community will be drawn an inch nearer
la misfire —that state of utter degradation in
which human beings, brutalised by toil, exist
and spawn and die on the minimum of food
which will support life ; the whole profit of
their industry being sucked by their employers.
Hitherto, in spite of financial “depressions”
■i i I trade crises, Australian working conditions
have been kept at a rational level of comfort.
The next few years will witness a terrible
struggle to decide whether that level can be
maintained, or whether the “inexorable” law
of supply and demand is to crush Australia also
into the deepest pit of labor slavery. Hudson
Bros.’ strike is an affair of outposts—it con-
cerns directly only 300 men j but it concerns
indirectly every white working-man in the
country. If the rate of wages is definitely
lowered by one firm, other firms must follow
suit; if lowered in one trade, every other trade
may reckon on sooner or later reaching the
same proportional level; if lowered in one city
or province, every other city or province will
answer to the pressure, and the local or “ tem-
porary ” reduction will by-and-by become
general and permanent. Capital is never
satisfied; has never enough; cries “ Give,
give ” as continually as the daughters of
the horseleech. Like stored water, it seeks
always the weakest point; and once it has an
outlet of an inch it pushes its vantage until
every barrier is destroyed. The more it gets,
the more it exacts. For 12 mouths Hudson
Bros.’employ£s have accepted wages 10 per cent,
less than their fellows were receiving from other
firms for similar work. Their reward is an order
to accept a further reduction of 15 to 20 per
cent. Such low r wages for similar skilled work
have, so far as The Bulletin is aware,
never before been offered in Australia. And
— mark this ! —Hudson Bros, are largely sub-
sidised from the public purse. Nearly three-
fourths of their work has always been
Government work—mainly railway carriage-
building. Of some .£20,000 worth of contracts
now in hand, probably £12,000 worth is to the
order of Government—to the order of the
people. This work is tendered for by various
firms on the basis of current rates of wages.
Hudson Bros., it would appear, have already a
10 per cent, advantage over their competitors,
and they ask for an advantage of 25 and 30
per cent. Plainly, Ritchie Bros., Yale and
Sons, the Atlas Engineering Co., Mort’s Dock
Engineering Co., and a host of minor firms,
must follow suit if the men are not enabled
to resist the firm’s demand. The result
will be that engine -fitters, say, who three
years ago were receiving 10s. to 12s. a
day, who are now receiving Bs. to 10s. a day,
will be reduced to Bs. to 6s. 6d. a day ; and so
proportionately with all trades. Hudson Bros,
will not be a whit better off, for there will be
just as much competition at the new rates as at
the old. The province will save money—its
railway carriages will be built more cheaply—
but at the expense of a permanent lowering of
the standard of living, a permanent lessening of
the slender margin of comfort which divides
free men from slaves. The Bulletin says
advisedly that the people of New South
Wales disdain the sacrifice. They have no
wish to grind the souls out of the
bodies of their servants. What Hudson Bros,
desire to do is to take from their workmen the
difference between the wages on the higher
scale—on which tenders for existing contracts
were presumably estimated—and the wages on
the lower scale—on which it is sought to com-
plete the contracts. This difference is to pay
dividends swallowed up in the past by unduly
high management expenses. If Hudson Bros,
succeed in this, the people and Parliament
should see that the firm’s existing contracts are
the last public contracts it handles in New
South Wales.
Pbemier Turner, like every other Victoria ll
Premier since the Coalition days, came into
office with a mandate from the nation to re-
trench, and keep on retrenching to the bitter
end. Yet he justly complains that every in-
dividual act of retrenchment is opposed to the
last extremity, not only by the parties
concerned, but by all manner of people
who are not concerned, and who bear
a hand on the understanding that they
will get similar assistance when wanted.
The latest trouble is at Maryborough. Mary-
borough has a “first-class gaol,” a large,
expensively-managed affair, to which criminals
from all the adjacent districts are sent. But,
owing to the falling-off in crime, there is now
a good deal of spare accommodation in the
Melb. prisons, and the staff is parti-
ally unemployed. Therefore, it is pro-
posed to send all the long-sentence prisoners
from the Maryborough district to Mel-
bourne, and make the local prison a “second-
class gaol ” for purely local purposes, with
a smaller staff. And thereupon a Mary-
borough deputation interviewed the Govern-
ment with extreme ferocity, and demanded
that the “status ” of the gaol should,be main-
tained, wdiether it was wanted or not. Ap-
parently, either Maryborough must have a first-
class gaol, where hangings and things like that
can come off, or else it will do its little share
to down Turner at next election. The moral
is obvious. Every Premier has a mandate to
retrench the other fellow, but when he goes
beyond that and proceeds to retrench this
fellow his end is drawing near.
The New South Wales National Ass under-
takes to prove that the proposed land-tax will
be “ a crushing impost on the producing
classes,” or something to that effect :
If Id. in the £ is all that will be imposed as land-value
taxation, what has the small landholder to complain
about from the actual point of d;w of payment? The
man with £475 worth of land would only pay £1 19s. 7d.,
and he would make an actual saving on the amount paid
through the Customs. Bat he would lose, and will lose,
even now, as every other landholder will, immediately on
the.imposition of the tax, by the decrease in the value of
his property. What does Mr. Garment, actuary of the
A.M.P. Society, say on the subject? “If a tax of only
Id. in the £ were imposed, then on the basis of 4 per
cent., the selling price of an ordinary conditional pur-
chase valued at £1 per acre would be immediately re-
duced to 17s. lid. per acre.” That is to say, each owner
of £475 worth of land will immediately lose £49 9s. 7d.
upon the value of his property, which will affect him in
the long run far more than the mere payment of Id. in
the £.
The two long, hairy ears of the Ass stand out
boldly against the landscape in this pronounce-
ment. The point, as it concerns the “ pro-
ducing classes,” depends, not on the market
price of the land, which is always a fluctuating,
unstable quality, but on the net value of the
produce which can be extracted from it. The
land which produced a profitable crop of
potatoes when it was saleable at £1 an acre will
produce exactly the same crop, other things
being equal, when it is only saleable at 17s. lid.
per acre. Also, if it rose to £3 10s. an acre, or
if it sunk to 2s. 6d. it would—again with the
proviso that other things are equal—yield
exactly the same return. If the State put d.
tax on the land which reduced its selling value
to 2s. 6d. an acre, and spent the money iri
making good roads and railways whereby the
farmer could get his products cheaply ami
readily to a market, it is quite probablfe that
the “ producing classes ” would be better off at
that figure than when the land was worth 20s;
The producer, while he is a producer and not a
land-jobber, doesn’t sell his laud and often
doesn’t even know whether it would fetch 30s.
an acre or 17s. 6d. If the fall in the value of
land is caused by low prices, exhaustion of the
soil, or want of roads, railways, or markets,
then he is affected as a producer ; if the fall
arises from none of these causes, then it affects
him in no degree whatsoever. It is the pro-
fessional landholder—the jobber and the man
who lives on rents—who will be troubled by
the new departure, and it is this person whom
the Ass is so badly worried about, only it hasn’t
the courage to say so.
Brisbane Worker's description of Quigley,
the white Mongreland leper who caught the
infection in childhood from a leprous Chinaman
who lived near his parents’ house :
At the present time Quiolev’s face is puffed and cor-
rugated, his eyes sinking somewhat deep into his head,
and very red. There is practically no hair on his face
either in the shape of eyebrows or lashes, and his com-
plexion generally is of a dull, s dlow hue. Here and there
are black lines—which might readily be taken for dirt,
but which are veins—and these add to the repulsiveness
of his countenance. His ears are twice the normal size,
the lobes being swollen to an extraordinary degree. His
neck, chest, and body are plenteously covered with repul-
sive sores. His finger-tips and parts of his hands are like
so much raw beef rendered putrid and dotted here and
there with blue coloured matter. The same may be
said of his toes, and both hands and feet are swollen
in manner similar to his face. Each finger (which
is eaten away to the depth of the nail) and each
toe are bound up with bandages, and to further hide
his horribleness the hands are encased in fingerless
leather gloves. He appears to be gradually losing his
voice, for he now speaks incoherently and at times his
utlerances are unintelligible at the outset. He can always
make himself understood, but he by no means speaks
with that fluency which characterises the speech of a
healthy individual. Two years ago ho was not nearly so
bad, and contrasting him with ins condition then we
should say that it would be a kindness to allow him to
quietly quit a life which must be a veritable hell.
The 11-years-old white boy recently sent to the
lazarette is afflicted with the same type of
leprosy. Two other cases have been since dis-
covered, and the Mongreland total is now not
far short of 100. Known and isolated—that is;
for no one knows how many unknown lepers are
at large, since the horrible disease apparently
takes any period up to 50 years to develop.
Presently the whole white community will be
anxiously feeling its ear-lobes when it awakes
in the night.
Editor Bulletin, —You suggest democratising the muni-
cipalities. How can that be done more than is done
already? Presumably the ratepaye.s know what aider-
men they want. Do you propose abolishing voting
according to property while you maintain taxation
according to property? You say “monopolies such as
gas-works and tram-lines would be acquired and woiked
for the benefit of the inhabitants.’’ Now, your par. refers
to Vic., of which I know little ; but let me speak of New
South Wales. There has, during the last eight years or
so, come about an entire change in the class of men
offering themselves for election as aldermen in nearly
every country municipality. The change has been, in
nearly all cases, from the level-headed bn-iness man to the
man whose sympathies and interests Inn e been, or should
have been, with the hard working-c uss s whose lot, up to
the time of his election, he shar >l. He was familiar
with the daily life of the people, wim the “shifts” and
devices to which they had to resort in order to eke out
7s. a day (which was until quite recently the common
wage in all country muni ipalities). Yet such aldermen
are always found on the side of what they call “retrench-
ment,” which means a reduction of wages and salaries all
round; itnevermeansthe use of caution in the expenditure
of money on what are called “ public works.” There are
few tramlines in the country towns ; but during the last
eight years many gas-works have been bought by the
local authorities, and many works have been built—with
what result? One result, I admit, has been a general re-
duction in the price of gis to the consumer, but it has
resulted very badly for the poor devil of a gas-stoker, the
gas-engineer, the accountant, and all others obtaining
their livelihood from the manufacture of gas. Salaries
a id wag s are subject to an annual reduction of 10 per
cent. — ‘the democratic alderman” looks upon this as
“his duty to the ratepayers.” Tne question whether the
work performed is worth the wage paid for it is never
considered. The men are usually told that “ there are
any amount of men ready to do your work at the reduced
wages ’’—and they perforce submit. As an instance of
what municipalised gas-works usually come to: Some time
ago the Molong municipality advertised for “ tenders ”
from persons willing to run the local gas-works, “ and
find all labor necessary.” What is this but “sweat-
ing ” ? Anyhow, it is not what The Bulletin
would advocate on “democratic” grounds, is it? An-
other instance: a Hunter River borough recently adver-
tised for applications from persons competent to fill the
posit! in of council clerk, borough overseer, and inspector
of nuisances. “ Preference will be given to persons having
a knowledge of gas-engineering.” They might also, in
the interests of “ strict economy,” have given a further
preference to persons willing to assist as road-laborers.
Will The Bulletin kindly say whether such action on the
part of democratic bodies should be imitated by the coun-
try as a whole? There is not a public company or mono-
poly in the State which has to stand so much comment as
the Australian Gaslight and Coke Company, yet that com-
pany pays its workmen higher wages than any munici-
pality does for similar duty. lam tired of “ democrats”
and their democratic ways. Give me the “ bloated capi-
talist he, at any rate, will pay me what lam worth to
him, and, when he does go in for “ retrenchment," he
generally begins by sacking those who don’t earn their
screw.—Yours, A Half-Roasted Gas-Stoker.
[There is a difference between true democracy
and false. If this country isn’t breeding the
right kind—the kind that wishes to get and to
pay a decent living-wage (and something over,
when possible)—then the idea of democratising
the municipalities is chimerical. It is in the
belief that only the minority of ratepayers are
tarred with the Molong and Hunter River
brush that this paper wrote and writes. Until
a lot more evidence is adduced to the contrary,
The Bulletin refuses to believe that the pre-
sent state of things can’t be bettered—or that
we haven’t got the men to better it. This paper
will take great pleasure in showing up all
attempts at municipal sweating. —Ed. B.]
When Yic. Gov. Brassey’s father was
railway-contracting there was hardly a country of
the world in which he did not take some big job.
At one time he had in all 80,000 men employed
on works involving .£17,000,000. Between 1859
and 1863 he, by his agents, built the Great
Southern, Great Northern, and Great Western
lines of N.S. W. For this work were imported
2000 laborers from England and Scotland, appa-
rently because the local labor available was too
dear and drank too much beer. The 2000 immi-
grants cost the contractors .£5 and the Govern-
ment £l2 per man to land. Seventy-eight miles
of Queensland railway were constructed under
the same auspices. When the old man died he
left .£7,000,000.

My Dear Moorabinda —
It has been definitely decided that Lady Duff
will end her melancholy Australian experience on
13th prox., and, with her daughters, will leave
for Europe, per R.M.S. Victoria, on that date. I
know of no one who does not feel very kindly
towards Lady Duff, and though her official term
was brief she was on the high road to achieve a
certain sort of sober, motherly, common-sense
popularity that will keep her memory green in
Australia. Coming after the glib, but nervous
talkee-talkee “ M.E.J.,” the silent Lady Duff—
who always deputed some flattered male or other
to respond for her, and who, at first, never even
opened a flower-show except per medium of a he-
official—was a not-unpleasant novelty.
People who knew them well seem to greatly
esteem the Duff girls, too. For example, they had
a brave, almost boyish way of “ bearing a hand ”
and not standing on their dignity at picnics and
other junketings when emergencies occurred and
help was needed. There was one hoof-and-wheel
party across country, I remember, when the vice-
regal trap got bogged, and the Y.R. demoiselles
literally put their shoulders to the wheel to help
it out of the mud.
Poor Governor Duff ! He is the first Governor
to be interred in a N.S.W. cemetery, and the con-
sequence is that the vice-regal burial has turned
“God’s acre” into Snob’s acre, especially since
the body of the late Governor will not be taken to
Europe (despite the widely-circulated rumor that
Mr. Pennyman had taken it with him) but is to
remain here. The Waverley cemetery has always
been a fairly fashionable place to leave your poor
clay in, but now gilt-edged prices are, I believe,
the rule, and anybody owning an unoccupied little
lot near the vice-regal portion finds himself a
lucky (grave) digger likely to have an embarrass-
ment of offers from moribund fashionables who
want to be “of the vice-regal party ” even in the
Valley of Death. Some enterprising speculators
are already putting up their little lots with
special stress ou the fact that they are “near the
Governor’s grave.” By the way, Sydney Women’s
Literary Club lately debated “What is a vulgar
person?” Well, I think that a vulgar person is
anyone who utilises the dead for advertising pur-
poses.
Victoria’s new Governor comes out in his well-
advertised yacht, the Sunbeam —the yacht in
which his first wife died, and in which, I believe,
lie went for a honeymoon raid with, Lady Brassey
No. 2 —but I think the Melbournians would rather
be came per balloon which might explode after
landing him, and cut him off from civilisation.
As I predicted, weeks ago, that yacht is going to
lie a sore trial to Toorak. It is already hinted
in the press that Lord B. hopes to make a
holiday trip to Maoriland in the Sunbeam, and
means “to explore the famous Sounds;” and if
his imminent Ex. is planning private picnics thus
far ahead before the full horror of the representa-
tive citizen has been spread before him, and before
the representative eitizeness has tried to call bis
wife “my dear,” what will happen when he knows
the worst? If the Victorian Government has the
true interests of Toorak at heart, somebody will
be hired to scuttle the Sunbeam.
Lord Hopetoun has departed in the odor of
popularity, promising to come out again, just as
did his ex-Ex. Garington, who hasn’t shown up
here since, and isn’t likely to. Apropos of popular
Governors, a man said to me the other day :
“ Why shouldn’t any Governor be popular? I
have to pay 14s. a gallon duty on my whisky ; the
Governor gets his duty-free. If I could get my
whisky for 18s. a dozen, as the Governor does,
instead of for 385., where is the man whocould get
ahead of me in popularity ?’’ From what one sees
of Government House buffet-scrambles this strikes
me as a most reasonable view.
Talking of Governors reminds me that a very
pretty and charming girl, who went ’Ome osten-
sibly to marry a particularly well-connected young
officer of a sponge-oakey complexion, will, so says
rumor, shortly return to the bosom of her family a
blossom still unplucked by the rude hand of man.
I am told that the first lesson the average Aus.
tralian girl needs to learn at ’Ome is that it’s
better business to make love to the average Eng-
lishman’s parents than to himself. People attri-
bute the breaking-off of the match to the machi-
nations of a certain voluble and influential Coun-
tess ; but, however that may be, the young lady is
so truly bewitching, even in the eyes of her own
sex, that it must be her own fault should she ever
lack a large assortment of the bravest and most
eligible of suitors.
Apropos of an Anglo-Victorian match broken
off in London by the somewhat elderly bridegroom-
elect the year before last, they say the free-and-
easy Australian manner “ does for ” many of our
girls in stiffly-starched England. The olive-
skinned beauty concerned, who failed to hook her
big fish, is said to have horrified her should-have-
been relations-in-law with her off-hand habits.
At lunch, one day, for example, a fly got into her
glass of water and she dipped it out with her
spoon-handle and flung it on the carpet ! But
don’t you think that the Australian servant is
responsible for the damsel thus deftly helping
herself out of a difficulty? In Australia you have
to dislodge foreign matter from your victuals for
yourself—there is, generally speaking, no pow-
dered flunkey hired for 10s. per week to fall
forward with a silver salver and a soup-ladle and
save the situation.
Last Saturday was the first day of the “Inter-
provincial Bicycle Championship Meeting ” on
Sydney Association Ground, which has a very
combed-up look just now, owing to its having
been so carefully polished for the international
cricket-boom. The little garden in front of the
members’ stand, which used to be sucli a bob-
tailed floral interval, is now in smart order ; and
if only people with a quiver-full wouldn’t bring
all their hostages to the Association Ground and
set them running amok round the parterres, the
gardenette would be a distinct advantage. As it
is, strangers mistake the place for a day-nursery
or a baby-farm.
There was a large, if rather suburban, attend-
ance on the opening-day, but the dressing on the
members’ was not impressive. We are between
seasons just now, and autumn garments
looked too warm, while the wearers of mus-
lin wore blue noses. Besides, there really
are no autumn fashions until the autumn race-
meeting at Randwick. Far and away the
most lovely object on the members’ stand was
a beautiful youth in a dark blue serge cycle suit
with silver badges, a small blue cap, and a waved
“bang” carefully arranged over his forehead.
Now that women are going in for hard hats and
the rest of it, I suppose Man will take to titivat-
ing himself in order to preserve the picturesque
balance? By the way, a neat blonde girl in
cream sported about nine yards of ribbon match-
ing her Edwin’s colors. As it happened, Edwin
came in with the ruck in every race I saw, and
appeared to be a rather rickety knight for any
girl to barrack for in her trimmings. A really
wise woman would only aggressively flaunt her
Romeo’s chromatic oriflamme when Romeo had a
fair chance of getting his nose in front of his field.
It isn’t kind to draw people’s attention to the
fact that you are the fair ladye of a “ selling-
plater.”
There certainly wasn’t much dressing on the
oval (which looked like golf-links, with the red
flags spotted about), though I don’t mean to say
that an American would have been shocked at the
appearance of the riders. A ’Murkan cyclist’s
wardrobe would make a ’Murkan cycle-meeting a
“men-only” show in Australia, and turn our
riders’ long bare shanks into the very pink of dis-
cretion. Mind you, I don’t personally object to
the bare shins : from a picturesque standpoint, I
think tights would be an improvement in the
more stringy-bark-looking cases, but I suppose
athletes must fly as light as possible—only don’t let
them snicker at the ballet, that’s all. The Aus-
tralian race-track cyclist only peels from his ankle
to a span above the knee—the upper part of him
is modesty itself, if only his garments would
’tend to business—but they won’t. On
Saturday, nearly every rider’s jacket got
loose behind and fluttered in the breeze, reveal-
ing instalments of spinal cord and mysterious
undergarments. That was the comedy of the
afternoon—but it’s to be hoped the wheelmen will
adopt the sensible jockey plan of having a string
run round the hem of the jacket, which ties it
securely round the waist. It is neater, and,
though nobody ever takes a chill while he or she
continues perspiring, it looks more hygienic not to
have a cool breeze playing on the heated spine.
The colors of the cyclists were mostly prettily
mixed. The gallant N.S.W. champion, Meg-
son, of the long horse-shaped face, looked
rather like an In Memorian card on wheels
in his magpie cap and jacket ; and Wyburd,
a reformed footballer, suggested piracy or a bottle
of cold poison with a sknll-and-crossbones in his
black jacket. I didn’t admire a white satin jacket
with infrequent pink spots—it looked like variola;
and though I much bleed Middleton, the Vic-
torian champion’s, willing way with his head in
riding, I didn’t quite fancy his colors—crockery-
blue with a large spotty pattern like a dyed
The success that Arnykos has met with,
and the universa l favour it enjoys both in the Old
and New Worlds, is a sufficient guarantee of the
advantages resulting from its use as a mouth-
wash, gargle, cosmetic, &c. It is unanimously
acknowledged to possess a mild and, at the same
time, energetic efficacy as an antiseptic wat r,
and is superior to all antiseptics at present kno n
to science, as expressed by Professor Sir Joseph
Lister, of Edinburgh, in the Lancet—which alone
ought to make Amykos a household word for
the Australian, who esteems cleanliness. Price,
Is. 61. per bottle at all chemists, perfumers, &c.
hyaena. Nor did I approve of Davis, the S.A.
champion’s, Prussian blue guernsey—it looked
wharf-lumperish among the painted satin suits.
The prettiest of these were a brace of youths who
rode up to the post together, the one in a lovely
shade of apple-blossom-pink satin jacket and cap,
and the other in pale-porcelain-blne satin with
white satin sleeves and blue-and-white-quartered
cap. They looked a pair of china ornaments, and
even if the pale-blue ornament did fall off his
gridiron in the stress of the first lap and lie
doubled up on the track until somebody dragged
him off, he made a lovely little heap of clothes,
anyhow.
But though I talk thus amiably about the cycle
sports I really do not believe in them at all. It
cannot be good to exhaust yourself so that you
tumble off your wheel in a fainting state while
experts pummel you back to life as if you were a
drowned man —and then support you off the field
one at each shoulder, as Middleton was supported.
At these struggles to push a wheel the fastest, one
overhears young men—healthy-looking young
men, too —telling how they knocked off cycle-
racing by the doctor’s orders—how “sick and
giddy ” they felt at the end of a race, and so on.
No wonder Australia is a continent dotted with
doctors’ red lamps when everybody, man and
woman alike, makes a sort of Aunt Sally of his or
her constitution by seeing how many blows it will
take to knock it edgeways. With a growing
generation of pallid female bicyclists and jolted
lawn-tennis girls (now I hear they have a ladies’
football club in London) to be mated with ex-
hausted bicyclists and other played-out athletes—
what a toll the doctors will levy on posterity !
Sydney Liedertafel’s recent concert had a sort
of polite pall over it owing to one or two melan-
choly points being insisted upon by the committee
in deference to the manes of Sir Robert Duff, who
was the society’s patron. The card started
lugubriously with an “In Memoriam,” “The
Long Day Closes,” sympathetically sung Dy the
Liedertafel, who all wore inky neckties “by
order,” and looked like mutes in consequence.
But if the society really meant to give a dust-and-
ashes air to its latest meeting, and to imply that
it only took to the platform to relieve its funereal
feelings, so to speak, it should have insisted upon
the assisting talent (Miss Lottie Hyarn and Miss
Edward Deane, who amiably filled a vacancy)
climbing into weeds too, in order to make up the
platform impressively ; for a battalion of black
neckties cannot hold its own against a soprano in
pink and a piano-expert in mulberry.
The concert was melancholy enough, however,
from a musical standpoint. It opened inauspici-
ously with a disappointment. Miss King, the new
and prominent soprano (I mean “new” in the
recently-discovered sense), did not perform ; and
there seemed to be a sort of mournful sequence
about the items, which began with a dirge and
almost finished with Arthur Deane giving a
gobbled kind of rendering of “ Thou art passing
hence, my brother.” No wonder gloom settled
over the large audience which left the Mausoleum
—I mean, the Centennial Hall—with a depressed,
all-flesh-is-grass sort of air.
The Liedertafel orchestra redeemed the situa-
tion with a most melodious rendering of Gounod’s
“La Colombo.” which ends with a rustling sound
like the fluttering of wings; and a dashing per-
formance of a Spanish waltz. Misses Hyam and
Lucy Allpress—they were scarcely successful in the
Kreutzer, though they got some thrilling effects out
of what Tolstoi calls the wicked part of the sonata
—were best in the selections from “Don Juan.”
There was not.a very fashionable house—“ Court
mourning,” aggravated by Lent, kept the hall com-
paratively free from any big social guns. Judge
and Mrs. Windeyer occupied the serai-circle of
patronage, and the dressing was not enthusiastic.
When you say that almost every woman had a
black bow in her back hair you have stated the
most salient points, though my eye was caught by
a man in a red woollen cap which looked as if
somebody had been sealing his hair on.
I paid a second visit to that most charming and
exquisitely-acted play, “The Case of Rebellious
Susan,” at Sydney Lyceum last Saturday, and
found it going better than ever. You’d think
that Susan would have drawn houses crammed to
the doors night after night, but it didn’t. Yet no
play ever presented in Australia deserved better
houses. The metier of the Australian is, alas!
not sparkling comedy. It is Variety—“ ’E dunno
w’ere ’e are,” with “’E’s found out w’ere ’e are”
for an encore. That, and totes and cigarettes. It
is a dreadful and irredeemably vulgar theatrical
outlook—you cannot expect managers to go on
staging the latest plays to small if keenly-appre-
oiative houses. If I were a despot, the theatre in
Australia should be handsomely subsidised, and
the chief recipients of my Imperial bounty would
be “ the Firm ” and Brough and Boucicault, to
whom this country owes a heavy debt of gratitude
for having supplied it, by means of vast outlays
in money and in labor, with a hundred delightful
and really civilised entertainments.
From David Jones and Co. I have received a
copy of their autumn publication, “ Shopping by
Post.” For country folks I can think of nothing
handier than this manual of styles and prices
thickly sprinkled with artistic illustrations and
showing just how the dresses, cloaks, and hats
look on the figure ; and though I have never seen
a real woman who looked quite like a fashion-
plate—generally a spectre which would frighten a
’bus-horse if it really appeared—still women can
get an approximate idea, anyhow, of how the new
styles look. Also the directions for self-measure-
ment and so forth, contained in “ Shopping by
Post,” must be plain to the meanest intelligence.
Yours affectionately, Sappho Smith.

A certain amount of audience was attracted
to. Her Majesty’s (Sydney) by the revival of
‘‘Called Hack,” a drama which is past its first
youth and getting well on to middle age. The
plucky Mr. Rignold s version of the story is
chiefly remarkable for its want of resemblance to
the original, and a good deal of interest and
probability have been lost in the process of
adaptation. Pauline, instead of being merely a
girl with a weakened intellect and a lost memory,
is a lunatic, howling piteously in the glare of the
limelight; and Gilbert Vaughan is a babbling
person, who starts out to hunt for a certain Italian
conspirator with fatal intentions, and begins by
telling his story and his intentions to the first
Italian conspirator he meets, so that he may go
away and warn the rest. This blank stupidity
makes the audience feel inclined to throw a large
piece of mud at the picturesque hero. The part
of Paolo Macari has been enlarged till the drama
is almost all Macari, and he comes in on every
possible occasion. When he can find no other
reasonable excuse for coming in, he comes in and
soliloquises about cats, particularly black eats.
Macari is a police spy of intense acumen, and
he cheerfully explains his calling to a man who is
dead certain, in the ordinary course of things, to
give him away and burst up the show. As a
matter of course, the other man does give him
away and bursts up the show. “Called Back,”
as presented by Mr. Rignold, is a good drama,
but it would have been a lot better if some un-
authorised person hadn’t improved the story for
the worse in such a reckless fashion.
• * i
Paolo Macari, with a murky wig and a'
sombre moustache, and a black stubble on his
chin, is a great effort, and Mr. Rignold is hereby
congratulated thereon. The black stubble on his
chin is one of the traditions of the character and:
others like it; the very grim and horrid)
traitor always shaves himself secretly in the dark,
places of the earth, and, in consequence, he never
gets his chin quite clean. Macari’s villainy sticks
out altogether tqo conspicuously, and only the
most simple-minded variety of patriot would be
taken in by him, and he is too reckless to be a>
brainy police-agent, and he has various other
things against him, including his portentous l
stride and his portentous hat, but it is a fine-
performance none the less. Scot Inglis makes ai
manly-looking hero, and the amount of wail which <
the adaptor has put into his part is regretable.
Miss Agnes Knight is a modified success as the-
deranged maiden in white, weeping in the lime-
light. Miss Athena Claudius does the best thaU
is possible with the conventional good girl, andl
Miss Kate Bishop puts a touch of genius into the-
conventional landlady with the spasms and the-
cats and the bottle of gin. Mr. Plimmer is com-
mendable, and Mr. Stirling Whyte is rather less
commendable, and Mr. Cyril Keightly is mainly
conspicuous for the way he opens and shuts his
mouth in moments of excitement. The rest oft
the co. consists principally of ferocious Russians l
knouting prisoners in Siberia.

That exceedingly pretty comedy, “The
Case of Rebellious Susan,” will last only a
week longer at Sydney Lyceum. “Rebel-
lious Susan” is an effort which grows on the public
appreciation, and looks its best when seen for the
seventh time, or thereabouts. There is no very
definite moral in it, which, in a sense, is a cause
for thankfulness; most stage morals are merely a
burnt offering on the altar of Mrs. Grundy, and a
sacrifice to the god of Commonplace, Therefore,
the audience can make its own moral. If Jim
Harabin, the husband of Susan, was really the
speechless ass he is represented to be by Mr.
Dorrington, then the lady’s conduct was justifiable,
anyhow. If he was rather less of an ass, then her
conduct was more or less justifiable, according to
the exact amount of ass he really was. Also,
when she becomes reconciled to her husband
because her lover forgot her in three weeks and
married another girl, as related by Mr. Compton,
her conduct is fully explained by the depressing
aspect of the messenger, if Mr. Compton ade-
quately represents the messenger. In any case,
“Rebellious Susan ”is a charming play, and the
leading parts are represented in almost perfect
style by Titheradge, Boucicault, and Misses
Noble, Faber, and Temple. Boucicault, as
the maudlin, long-haired dreamer who weds
a stormy, red-headed girl for the sake of
“afflatus,” is one of the most perfect charac-
ters in the piece. The only unsatisfactory
feature is that the s r ory closes without explaining
whether the red headed girl—who ought to appear ■
in pants—got 18 months or five years for inciting
a crowd of females on strike to wreck a post-office.
If the lady’s arrest could be shifted into the second ?
act, and the third act could close with a newsboy
calling out a “speshul edition” with the news :
that she had got five years, it would send the ■
audience away fully and completely satisfied. The .
Bulletin hopes that she gets the five years any-
how, partly on account of the. color of her hair,,
and partly because of the way it hangs dowm
about her ears.

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback—the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the .manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
poach and ivory may be had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

magnificence. The present company quits this
transient sphere and goes the way of all theatrical

The dust of years has gathered on “A
Scrap of Paper ” since the Majeronis last took it
in hand, at Melbourne Bijou, and the unpreten-
tious little thing was not welcomed back to its
old haunt, on Saturday, with much enthusiasm.
“A Scrap of Paper,” in the moral British version
of Sardou’s comedy, is a harmless love-letter,
which an uninteresting married woman wishes to
recover from a former sweetheart. A clever lady
friend acts as ambassador in the matter. She
captures the holder of the note, but when he is
willing to surrender possession of the same it goes
ingeniously astray, and has several narrow escapes
from coming under the notice of the aforesaid
married woman’s jealous husband before
being happily destroyed. “A Scrap of Paper”
was a brilliant novelty in the long ago.
Now it is off - color and out of date. Miss
Amy Roselle, as the ready - witted Susan
Hartley, appears at her very best in one trying
situation, but for the lighter kind of comedy work
her touch is somewhat heavy. Also, Mr. Dacre,
who is not required to do more than bustle gaily
through his part, seems slower and more emphatic
than he ought to be. He has too much manner
and stride, and effusiveness, and he slaps men on
the shoulder far too frequently. For the rest, Mr.
Elton represents an aged collector of beetles with
careful art, and some minor characters are better
filled than others.

“The New Boy” will continue to suffer

“Pinafore ” are to happen at the Princess’s in the
interests of the Jewish charities. A rush for
tickets set in some time ago, and, according to all
accounts, the sick and indigent Hebrew is bound
to do well by his double-barrelled benefit. If there
be more than one distressed Jew in Victoria they
will both of them do well.

On Tuesday next (9th) bonnie Miss Marie
Elster takes her farewell benefit at Melbourne
Royal. The sweet singer will display the quality
of her voice, and likewise prove its powers of
endurance, in three characters. An act of “ Mari-
tana,” the Garden scene -from “Faust,” and
Offenbach’s “ Choufleuri,” with Miss Elster as
the heroine in each instance, are the chief features
of a big bill. Everybody worth mentioning is a
patron or a member of the committee, and every-
body not worth mentioning has bought a ticket in
token of an earnest desire to be present.
A neat idea from Sydney Truth ; “The
R< id Government is (from its own point of view)
coaxing N.S. Wales to live in adultery with Pro-
tection until they see fit to sanction its betrothal
to Freetrade.” In a word, Gcorgey-Porgey is
keeping a little harem of fiscal policies.
The Wild-Cat Column .
The A.M.P. Society, which has hitherto con-
fined itself strictly—a good deal too strictly, in fact-to
ordinary life, endowment and annuity business, issues a
series of tables for new forms of insurance. Some of
these are novel, and most of them are distinctly valuable.
One of the best of the lot is the “ trust investment
policy, under which the society, instead of paying over
the insurance money in a lump sum to the widow, or
other beneficiary, at the death of the insured, pays her
5 per cent, interest during her life, and at her death
hands over the principal to her heirs. By this arrange-
ment a man who insures for, say, £2OOO, can secure for
his widow an income of £lOO a year for life, the £2OOO
benjg paid when she also quits this vale of woe. Con-
sidering that the average widow is fleeced, sooner or later,
by some hard-faced harpy, or loses the money in some
hopeless investment under the advice of a “ friend,” or
is cleaned out by her second husband, who backs
a horse with the pile, the advantages of this
scheme are enormous. The only objection is that
the widow’s heir or heiress is exposed to similar
danger when the money is at last paid over. To obviate
this the society issues a “long-term-annuity policy,”
under which the old man may direct that the society
shall pay the 5 percent, income arising from his policy,
first to his widow, and thereafter to his children, or, fail-
era ’j to h ' s grandchildren, for a period of 50 years.
At the end of the 50 years the income ceases, and the
total amount of the policy is paid over as directed. This
is probably the most complete provision for the future
yet invented. The man who dies with a long-term-
annuity policy grasped in his bony hand can feel that he
has made things reasonably secure for as long a time as
any average dying father cares to look forward.
. Among the other tables are a new plan for
infant insurance; various new forms of annuities; a
scheme by which two people may effect a joint insurance
to secure a fixed income, equal to 5 per cent, on the
amount of the policy, during the life of the survivor, the
whole amount of the policy being paid over at the said
survivor s death ; and various other valuable provisions.
The Bulletin, however, pins its faith to the “ long-term-
annuity ” scheme. The joy of knowing that no crooked
trustee or attorney can get at the money for half-a-cen-
tury certain is something worth dying for.

The Mutual Life Assurance Society of Victoria
publishes a balance-sheet which, in most respects, is
eminently satisfactory. The premiums for the year 1894
are £115,000, being about £7OOO less than in 1893, but
this reduction is of comparatively small account. The
funds have increased by £44,000, and are now £902,000
The interest on investments (£44,061) is at the rate of
rather oyer 5 per cent.—a very good proportion under
present circumstances—and more than covers all death-
claims and bonuses. The said death claims amount to
£32,000, and it is a notable fact that they have decreased
every year since 1890. Also, the society has now £26 3s.
Bd. on hand for every £lO9 of insurance in force—a remark-
ably high proportion—and a handsome bonus will be de-
clared next year. One especially good feature in the balance-
sheet is that it distinguishes between interest accrued but
not yet due and interest actually outstanding. The amount
accrued is £709 ; the amount outstanding which fell due
on 30th and Slat December, the latter being the day when
the accounts closed, is £1129 ; and the amount outstand-
ing, which fell due previous to 30th December, and which
can be reasonably described as arrears, is only £370.
The total amount of rent accrued and outstanding—for
some reason this item is not subdivided in the same
fashion as the interest—is only £796, Judging by these
figures the investments must be remarkably sound, for
the first evidence that an investment isn’t sound is
generally the difficulty of collecting interest. The balance-
sheet also shows separately the value of properties ac-
quired by foreclosure, which item amounts to only
£34,000. Altogether, it is about the most definite and
complete publication of its kind yet received, and furnishes
much more information than is usual in such documents.
The expenses of the Mutual Life of Victoria in
1892 were 27Jper cent, of the premium income, or nearly 20
per cent, of the total income. In 1893 they were 28| per
cent, on premiums, or nearly 21 per cent, on total income.
And in 1894 they were 29J per cent, on premiums, or a
little over 21 per cent, on the entire income. Considering
the steady reduction in death claims, the smallness of the
losses on investments, and the good rate of interest
realised, it appears that the society can stand this heavy
expense rate without serious injury, but it is a lament-
ably heavy rate all the same, and the recent increase is to
be regretted, especially at a time when many other
societies have contrived to show a small reduction. The
Mutual Life of Victoria, by the way, is not the
worst sinner in this respect, but it is a bad enough sinner
all the same.

The Scottish Widows’ Fund makes a big bid for
fame by the announcement that it has £15,000 stand-
ing to the credit of the “ unclaimed surrender value
account,” which it is eager to pay over to the right-
ful owners. Such moneys come under a like category
to the unclaimed balances in banks, concerning which
legislative enactment is being constantly demanded. The
voluntary announcement by the Scottish Widows’ Fund
deserves praise, whether the move is bold advertisement
or only a piece of solid Scotch honesty.

The Sydney Permanent Freehold, Land and
Building Co. met its depositors, the other day, with a
proposition that the current half-year's interest should be
paid in six instalments extending over three years, that
payment of interest be stopped for two years,’and there-
after be reduced to 2£ per cent., and that the deposits be
repaid at some date not fixed, after all other liabilities
are discharged. The meeting kicked considerably against
these drastic proposals, but finally agreed to reduce the
rate to 2J per cent., the next two years’ interest to stand
over and to be paid when circumstances admit. The
proposal to pay the interest now due in six half-yearly
instalments was dropped. Altogether the shareholders
conceded a great deal more than any reasonable board
had a right to expect, and the fact that only one indig-
nant clergyman proposed liquidation is an evidence that
the modern Australian creditor is a patient and long-
suffering animal.

The Melbourne property market is beginning to
be alive again. The South Melbourne Permanent Build-

much better than was expected. Which is more wonder-
ful than the rising of Lazarus from the dead. Twelve or
eighteen months ago the auctioneer might have raved in
his rostrum until he broke a blood-vessel and died, with-
out getting a bid, unless some seedy man with his hair
standing up through his hat had scornfully offered tup-
pence for the lot.

that they have realised during the past year
£29,700 by property sales, have paid off £38,000
worth of deposits, and reduced the total liabilities by
£121,000. Since the liquidation began, £234,000 of lia-
bilities have been paid off. They further report in tones
of joy that the total liabilities are now only £350,000, and
prices are improving so much that it seems actually pos-
sible that they may pay off everything and have a balance
left for the shareholders, or even that the dead and gone
Metropolitan may one day start again. Whereat half the
audience was too much stunned to speak, and the other
half uttered the first cheer which has been heard at a
liquidation meeting since 1892.

The Liverpool and London and Globe Insur-
ance Co., one of the oldest and safest foreign offices in Aus-
tralia, was established in England in 1836, and founded
its Sydney office in 1853, taking over at the time all the
business of the Australasian, Colonial and General Life
Assurance and Annuity Co. The committee which
authorised this incorporation included such names as
Alfred Stephen, Edward Knox, William Walker, Charles
Nicholson, G. K. Holden, and John Gilchrist. Mr.
Elward Knox was for a long time one of its directors,
while Sir Charles Nicholson, for some time Speaker of
N.S.W. Legislative Assembly, is now Chairman of
the London Board of Directors. Six of its oldest life
policy-holders are or were the late ex-Chief Justice
Stephen, E. Deas Thomson, Thomas, Icely, Mr. Jus-
tice Manning, James Norton, and Mr. A’Beokett. Their
life policies are nearly half-a-century old ; ex-Chief
Justice Stephan’s policies doubled themselves in bonuses,
and five years ago the co. (rave him the privilege of dis
continuing the payment of his premiums. The company’s
assets at the end of ’93 totalled £9,085,790, and during
the last few years of depression the trading balance be-
tween fire premiums and expenditure has reached most
satisfactory figures ; it was £70,544 in ’92, and £70,955 in
'93. In the following clearly-specified terms and figures
the company guarantees profits to policy-holders:
“The assured's share will be nins-tenths of the pro-
fits ascertained to have accrued upon life policies
of their class on the participating scale.’’ Its Aus-
tralian and Maoriland affairs are wholly managed by the
Sydney Board. Nearly £250,000 is invested in Australian
banks ; the current account of the Sydney Head Office is
£50,000, and all Australasian funds are invested in Aus-
tralasia. Since inception to’93 the Australian office has
paid £1,939,500 under fire and life policies. It is now
beginning to push its life business, and for this purpose
is working on a table, which allows the payment of
reduced premiums for the first five years.

The latest alleged Customs fraud is said to have
been perpetrated by the simple process of vast ly over-valu-
ing goods exported, for the purposes of drawback. This
idea opens up a new and extensive field of iniquity. For
instance, a firm may import £5OO worth of dutiable goods,
and, by means of a bogus invoice, represent their value
as £2OO, and pay duty on that amount only. Then it
may re-export them to another province, and, by means
of another bogus invoice, represent their value at £lOOO,
and thus get refunded five times the duty it paid. Then
the importer in the adjacent province, by means of a
third bogus invoice, may represent their value as £3OO,
and pay duty on that amount, and re-export them again
with a fourth sham invoice, which represents them as
worth £909, and get his duty refunded three times over.
Until tba goods wear out from actual hard travelling
there wema no end to the proceeding, unless Federation
comes along, and interprovincial duties are abolished,
and there are no more drawbacks to be collected.
Federation will be the end of more than one swindle
which now flourishes exceedingly.

How they “have” the Customs. A clothier
when packing goods for drawback (i.e., where refund
of duty paid is claimed on exportation of the goods
or goods made of duty-paid material) surreptitiously
slips various parcels, which have been checked on the
invoice, under the counter. Some few days later he
passesanother entry, claiming refund or drawback a second
time on the same goods, and scores a further profit.
Another game is to say men’s suits made up of 3yds.
duty-paid cloth, are made from 3£yds., and as there is no
practicable check, the State again suffers.

The Bears have had their time on the silver-

penny per ounce. The Japanese are said to be demand-
ing £70,000,000 from China. This would be one reason
for a hardening in silver stocks, but the “paucity of

Sydney Daily Post has gone the way of all
journalistic attempts to exist on the heave-offerings of
Labor and Democracy of its peculiar kind. For twelve
weeks the paper has been run by a very good staff, which,
despite innumerable disadvantages, kept the sheet well
before the public as a newspaper. The first week’s salary
of the literary staff was paid; half of the second week’s
was also forthcoming, then the limp and down-at-heel
ghost staggered on his halting parade and fell right down.
Since 20th Jan. not one of the employes has received a
cent by way of salary, and from the editor, to whom
nearly £lOO is owing, down to the smallest messenger
boy in the office, all are creditors of the company. On
Tuesday morning a demand was made for salary, and was
not responded to. Then the boys struck. Labor omnia
vincil. The Post got about three months’ work out of
its employes for about three weeks’ wages.

The only comment heard among the B.H.

Men who know the Mt. Brown (N.S.W.) dis-
trict, seeing the dry-blowers at work about Coolgardie,
have resolved to keep the older field in mind. Four or five
have already returned, and half-a-dozen machines are on
the ground or on their way thither. More prospecting is
being done than at any time since the first rush, X 3 years
aeo. But the country, some old diggers think, is little
likely to produce any big things.

Central B.H. shows on last half-year’s work a
profit of £11,285 ; while £2600 was also spent on
the Extended cross-cut. But this profit is scarcely
proper to the half-year. Against it has to be set much-
exploratory work done and paid for in the dark days.

“Billy” Jones has offered, on behalf of an
English syndicate, £576,000 for the Tasmania G.M. and

years the co. has raised 244,390 tons stone for 329,2770 z.

£200,000 in 4000 £5 shares, of which £2 12s. is called up.
Amalgamation with the adjoining Florence Nightingale'

Bible-names again ! Two
Victorians, whose front names
are respectively Malaohi and
William, sentenced to death,

The plot of Boldrewood’s
new book, “The Sphinx of
Eaglehawk,” is laid in the year
1852. Yet, on page 28, bespeaks
of “Major Noretusk, V.C.,”
going to a fancy-ball as “a
sowar of irregular horse with a
cuirass of chain-armour taken by
him in single combat in the
Indian army.” Now, the V.C.
was not instituted until '56, so
that the-Major could not have
worn the Y.C. in ’52; and, if
we are to infer that the cuirass
was captured in the Indian
mutiny, that is equally impos-
sible, because the Mutiny did
not break out till ’57. Boldre-
wood should get Louis Becke to
he'p him in his dates.
Since the early days of
Edward Gorrv there has not,
perhaps, been a better 6st. 7lbs.

Jack Stevenson, who lately
attracted notice by riding three
and four winners in succession
at Flemington and Caulfield.
Stevenson was “ discovered ” in
Sydney by trainer Foulsham,
and taken over to Victoria some
18 months ago. He is still quite
a little fellow—much more of an
infant than his photograph
would lead one to suppose, and
if encouraged to practice the art
of ruling to win, may presently
show the public how great is the
difference between a jockey and
the avtrage pigmy on horse-
back. Stevenson, like many
stable-lads who have come to
the front, is a mild, seraphic-
looking young party — a nice
specimen of the promising light-
weight class. The quieter the
boy, the better for his ’orse, as
a rule.

rot, of course, but quite a poetic outburst to come
from the dour-visaged ex-meatman. After this
we shall not be surprised to hear a working-
bullock spouting hexameters.

JOCKEY-BOY STEVENSON.
Ex-Gov. Hopetoun and Gov. Brassey are
to “confer” in England at the end of May con-
cerning the government of Victoria. The be-
millioned Brassey will be one more on the list of
Governors who have come expecting to sway the
rod of empire—and have stayed, to be the petty
idol of a sycophantic coterie.
One incident in the
“New Boy,” at Melbourne
Princess’s, thrilled every
bald-head with excited envy.
That is when the pert and
pretty Edith Housley coils her
girlish arms round the diminu-
tive Ralph Roberts’ neck and
wants to kiss him, as shown in
the picture herewith. The New
Boy’s refusal to be kissed is a
distinct breach of the natural
law, and is the most glaring im-
probability Thk Bulletin has
ever noticed in a play.
“Will Honeycomb,” in
Dubbo Despatch, says that the
late Governor Duff had a most
extreme aversion to signing
death-warrants. When the
cases of Montgomery and Wil-
liams, sentenced to death for
wounding a policeman, were be-
fore the Executive, the members
of that body and the Govt, were
anxious to avert the death-
penalty, but the report of Judge
Stephen, who was present and
whose duty it was to sign the
death-warrant, left no loophole.
When Premier Dibbs handed the
Governor the executive minute to
sign, prior to handing it over to
Judge Stephen, H.E. refused,
stating that he held the pre-
rogative of grace and pardon.
The Premier then told him that
on reading the official instruc-
tions he would find that these
privileges had been taken from
him and vested in his Ministers.
The Governor read and re-read,
and admitted that he had no
alternative, signed, flung down
the pen in disgust and left the table.
Chief-Justice Griffith, who 35 years ago
was entered on the roll of students at Sydney
University by his father, Rev. E. Griffith, visited
the University last week to perform the same
duty for his own son. Years ago, it was Griffith’s
hope that Queensland would have a University of
her own long before to-day.
Both the Governor of Pentridge Prison
(Col. Bull) and the Governor of Melb. Gaol (Capb.
Burrowes) want to retire. The real reason, not
given in the newspapers, is said to be that they
are continually quarrelling with the Inspector-
General, Capb. Evans, who governs governors
with a rod of sealing-wax.
At the Melb. “ citizens’ ” banquet to the
vanishing Gov. Hopetoun, H.E. spoke from
voluminous notes (probably outlined by secretary
Wallington), and while he was speaking he
dropped them. Down he dived under the table,
and while he was below someone filled up his
glass. It was like a bit of a farce.
The house at South Yarra occupied by Dr.
Bage, the defendant in the libel-action that has
been causing so great a stir in Melbourne, is the
one formerly inhabited by “Miss Milne and I’
and “ The Yellow Aster ’’— otherwise Dr. and
Mrs. Mannington Caffyn. Mrs. Caffyn wrote
most of her now famous story there.
the lawyers of the old legal families
are not thick-skinned. The eminent Mr. Cecil
Stephen, of Sydney, not long ago refused 250
guineas to go to Broken Hill and hold a brief
before His Honor Justice Matthew Henry
Stephen. “ I would like the brief, but Ido not
care to appear before my brother,” he said.
Edmund Mitchell, erstwhile of Melb. Age,
and the Pastoralists’ Review, has just been
visiting Coolgardie on behalf of London Daily
Chronicle, Glasgow Weekly News, and the
British Australasian. He returned to London
on March 16, after writing a series of articles
taking an optimistic view of the field’s future.
An old pioneer of the Inverell district died
last week in Hugh Gordon, a colonist since 1839,
who represented Ti nterfield in the Assembly from
’GO to TO. Apropos , Parkes once, waving his
hand loftily towards the Opposition benches, said,
“Since my time in Parliament, I have seen over
500 such members come into the ’Ouse and pass
hout again into hoblivion.’’
Dr. C. J. Martin, now of Sydney Univer-
sity, will almost for a certainty succeed Prof.
Halford in the chair of Physiologv at Melbourne.
His recent researches on the action of snake-
venom, &c., and his distinguished English record
will do a lot for him ; and, furthermore, the re-
tiring professor strongly recommends the brilliant
young scientist’s appointment.
One difficulty in the appointment of Chief
Justice Dailey as Governor of N.S. Wales is per-
sonal to the Judge. His Honor has served only
about seven years as Chief Justice, not half the
time necessary to entitle him to a judicial pen-
sion. As six years gubernatorial service would not
carry a pension with it, between the two stools the
Acting-Governor would come to the ground in his
old age.
Professor George Britton Halford, M.D.,
Dean of the Medical Faculty, Melb. University,
who has lectured in the Medical School for 33 years,
has just sent in his resignation, advancing three
reasons therefore : “(1) I am an old man of 70;
(2) I do not want to die in harness ; (3) I believe
that an infusion of young blood would benefit the
school.’’ Ceology Professor McCoy, however,
stoutly declares that, for his part, he will remain
in harness to the last.
Perhaps the biggest “ fall-in ” Gov. Hope-
toun ever had was when a Bendigo miner was
killed under sensational circumstances, and he
wrote asking what he could do for the family.
“Send a cheque for <£so,” laconically replied the
astute and unoourtly secretary of the relief com-
mittee. H.E. had to send .£5O accordingly. It
was quite a lesson to him in the art of question-
formulation.
In these days of leniency to imprisoned
embezzlers of banker and politician quality it

poetic, spiritualistic, vegetarian, Cyril Haviland,
the one-time secretary of Sydney School of Arts.
Few guilty men were ever less guilty than the
ghost-seeing Cyril, and few dishonest men were
ever less likely than he to be made honest by a
protracted residence in prison.
In all probability Mr. Edmund Barton,
Q.C. (now temporarily on the Bench), will be the
next N.S.W. Supreme Court Judge. No nn re
generally acceptable appointment could be made.
Mr, Barton’s career, including his long term as
Speaker, proves him to be a man of eminently
judicial mind, and possessed of the qualities,
apart from a mere knowledge of law, which are
ever desirable in the President of a Court. It is
interesting to recall that “Toby” held his first
criminal brief in 1872, when he was assigned by
the Crown as junior in the defence of the un-
speakable Lester, the Parramatta River Thug.
“Geographic History of Queensland.’*
It is Mr. Archibald Meston’s misfortune that no-
body has ever been able to take him seriously,
except himself and the photographer who took
the portrait reproduced in this week’s Bulle-
tin. Whether even himself takes him seri-
ously may be doubted, for there is a certain
munchausenish, gasconian twang about his Fgo
which Alter Ego should find irresistibly comic.
On the other hand, the Mestonian “ I ” reaches
such prodigious dimensions that by all the laws of
complementaries “ i ” must be a personage far too
insignificant to snigger. Certain it is, at all
events, that though Mr, Meston has been a con-
siderable figure in the second rank of Queensland
notables for the last 20 years, and has played, not

without credit, many minor parts besides those of
pressman, politician and naturalist, his name is
never mentioned without a smile. That his
magnum opus, the just-published “ Geographic
History of Queensland,” will alter the local
appreciation of his character, and transform
him from unveracious humorist into veracious
chronicler, is not so certain. Others than
Jerome have discovered how persistently people
find fun in the pathos of the funny man anxiously
endeavoring to get rid of his label. And Mr.
Meston jokes unintentionally even on his title-
page, for, whatever “Geographic History ” may
mean, it surely does not mean anything like the
contents of the succeeding pages. The book
should really be called “ A Miscellany of Curious
and Interesting Facts concerning Queensland and
Australia.” It has no particular literary merit;
though the author has been unable to deny him-
self the pleasure of reprinting a quantity of
turgid rhetoric collected from the purple patches
of his previous writings, of which one can
only say, with old Abe Lincoln, that
for people that like this sort of thing, this
is just the «ort of thing those people like.
With commendable forethought, however, the
dubious dithyrambics are immediately followed
by a chapter on “ Church Statistics ’’—doubtless
in order that the contemplation of holy things
may shame the critical blasphemer into silence.
But, dithyrambs excepted, the style throughout is
the flattest journalese ; there is no attempt at con-
nected narrative ; and the “ Geographic History ”
merely brings together, tinder a number of inde-
pendent headings, the cream of the information
contained in Mr. Meston’s head, or diaries, or
scrap-books, as the result of a life’s reading and
observation. Mr. Meston has read much and
remembered much ; he has united, as an observer,
exceptional talent to exceptional opportunity; and
his book does credit to his industry in compilation
and his perseverance in original research. Its
shortcomings have been noted ; but they are far
outweighed by its merits. The book is unique,
and every Australian should get it and read it
at once. No other man could have written it;
its facts are little known, and most have
never before been brought together, while the
author adds much that is new and striking of
his own ; it is extremely interesting, and a trea-
sure for reference. Mr. Meston has a real genius
in the collection of materials for history, and The
Bulletin (which takes him seriously) congratu-
lates him on producing a book of extraordinary
and permanent value to Australian literature.
The volume, by-the-by, is poorly printed and
meanly bound by the Queensland Government
Printer (who plainly did not take the author
seriously); and it is to be hoped that a second
edition will soon be available with all the typo-
graphical embellishment that the contents de-
serve.
The word “reconstruction” is a disease
in Victoria since the banks failed. Down at
Nutnurkah, the impecunious council has notified
the shire and water trust officers that their
services will be dispensed with, “with a view to
reconstruction of duties.”

Wrixon, Yic., back from the Colonial

Dunedin (M.L.) has started a wax-match
factory. It employs nearly 100 hands, and turns
out good matches at the same old price, and, so
far, it has more orders than it can supply. The
duty of 1/4 to 5/6 a gross is the visible reason
of its success.
The martial Sargood, at a recent Melb.
softgoods ceremony, claimed that “we ragmen

ing he has come to the front, whereas he has
simply cultivated it.
The great question of the “ walk-about ”

The “walk-about ” is that variety of S.S. Islander

Very few Vic-
torians know that
Gov. Hopetoun made
a couple of thousand
pounds—” bunce ”
by his sorrowful de-
parture. Till Octo-
ber he will remain
Governor on leave of
absence, his salary of
£333 6s. Bd. per
month being divided
equally between Chief
Justice Madden and
his noble self. Melb.
Age offers a sweet
apology for the situa-

Yic. and N.S. W.
are in trouble about
the payments that
should be made by
selectors. The com-
mencement of ' the
difficulty was the ab-
surd rule which
charged the same
“purchase - money”
for lands of all values.
Lands good, bad and
indifferent were dis-
posed of at a shilling
per acre for a score
of years. In the first
place, the State should
not alienate the land.
In the second place,
it should charge pure
“rent” to selectors—
basing the amount of
“ rent ” on the actual
value of the land un-
der lease. With a
reasonable rent-
charge the present
selectors’ difficulty would never have arisen.
Since the Victorian coal-mines were opened
two or three years ago, the price of coal to the
railway department has dropped by nearly 9s. per
ton. Freetraders complain that the Vic. Govern-
ment pays more for Vic. coal than the price at
which it could now procure the superior article
from Newcastle. But the Government patronage
keeps the mines open, and Newcastle coal is cheap
because the Vic. mines are open. If they once
closed, the good old coal-famine days would pro-
bably soon come back.
Dear Bulletin, —Parkes couldn’t con-
sistently coalesce with anybody. Four years ago
I was in the gallery and heard the Ancient put ib
thus : “ Coalition —Hi regard hit has a short road
chosen by short-sighted men to the solution hof
political difficulties.”— Thorold D.
Chits of boys, as a Sydney constable
points out, are paid Is. lid. per hour for filling up
electoral rights, while the constable who distri-
butes the documents is paid only 2s. per day—a
day meaning eight hours. If working-man legis-
lation means equitable remuneration for work
done indignant Robert is right in his growl.
Specimen of English from Reid’s N.S.W.
Local Government Bill: “If the council of any
municipality or shire borrow on the credit of the
municipality or shire which the municipality or
shire is not legally bound to repay, all aldermen
or councillors who have consented to the borrow-
ing of such money shall be jointly and severally
liable,”&o. It is sometimes a wise relative that
knows its own antecedent.

which Australia’s public men have landed the

departing vicegerents, it will be necessary, to save
breach-of-promise actions, to put the Governor-
Generalship in commission. Jersey, Hopetoun,
Kintore, and Carington have already been effu-
sively asked to take it, and, of course, Brassey
will be similarly attacked ere long.
The Dominion Goveinment, according to
cables, seems to have stepped in to give denomina-
tional education the place in the Canadian pro-
vince of Manitoba which a majority of the resi-
dents refused it. Manitoba not long ago established
a national school system, which parents of all
religions could freely support; bub the Catholics,
beaten at the local polls, appealed to the Federal
Govt, for aid, which has apparently been granted.
If Chief Justice Darley were selected as
N.S.W. Governor by the Imperial authorities,
Chief Justice Griffith (who practically appointed
himself to the Bench) would no doubt aspire to
the Queensland Governorship. Then (to show the
noxiousness of such a system) we should have the
recreant radical and black-labor apologist as
figure-head of a community by most of whose
members he is politically, if nob personally,
detested.
Gov. Brassey (please pronounce this name
“ Bracy ”) owns 26,000 acres of land in Westralia
which, he says, he bought “for purely philan-
thropic purposes.” Also, the S.A. Co. has 40,000
acres in South Australia which it bought for
purely philanthropic purposes, taking its solemn
oath to that effect. Bub ib “chucked up ” philan-
thropy long ago, and collared .£1,676,000 of
unearned increment, and is now as hard and
bowelless a concern as ever paid a 15 per cent. div.
Premier Turner’s civil remonstrance re the
S.A.-Maoriland commercial treaty, as being calcu-
lated to hinder Federation—which it certainly is,
seeing that Maoriland stands out of the Federal
scheme —only evoked from Kingston an irrelevant
snarl about the refusal of Victoria to give up the
barren strip of debateable land on the border.
That miserable scrap of dust promises to be, after
all, the worst stumbling-block in the way of the
Commonwealth. Judging from Kingston’s tone,
ib would seem as if the Maoriland treaty was nego-
tiated mainly because of that patch of disputed
territory. Which is vaguely suggestive of the
man who fired a gun at the French President in
order to draw attention to his new invention for
stuffing hair-mattresses.
NO INGEE TIVE.
SWAGMAN : “ I wonder if it's any use axin' for wurk at that cocky’s ?”
SUNDOWNER: “ What’er Y OU want work for? Yer boots’ll last yer
’nother six months,”
The Age’s correspondent expresses his
opinion that Maoriland will nob do as it threatens
and wipe oub the second chamber altogether, bub
will give the elective system a trial possibly on
Victorian lines, and if it then finds the Upper
House no more amenable to reason, the Upper
House will be abolished. This is like tha horse-
sense of a man who wants to kill a tiger-cub, bub
resolves to feed the animal up and wait till ib is
full-grown and lusty before knocking ib on the
head. The Vic. elective Upper House is the
“THE BULLETIN'S” AMATEUR ART GALLERY.
CISSY : “ Grandpa, did Noah only take two of every kind into the Ark ? ”
GRANDPA : “ Yes, dear, only two of every kind of beast and bird and creeping

two fleas ? ”
most pig-headed, assertive, and hopelessly incura-
ble council in Australasia. Maoriland can take
on a similar body easily, but abolishing it is quite
a different thing, since that cannot be done with-
out the consent of the intended victim.
M‘llwraith has resigned his various offices
in the Queensland Government, bub still remains
a member of Cabinet without portfolio. He will
probably never come back to Queensland, but he
will also probably remain more or less a Minister
without portfolio to the day of his death. Even
Parkes at his best never hung on to the shadow of
office half so tenaciously as M'llwraith.
Premier Reid intimated to Britain that
N.S.W. Governor’s allowances would be for the
future curtailed. In one way this is quite right,
but where was Mr. Reid’s authority for so acting ?
The country which allows a Premier to anticipate
Parliament in one direction cannot justly com-
plain if it finds its Premier anticipating ib, or
misinterpreting it, in another direction. Young
democracies must be ever on the watch to prevent
little fellows, mere bubbles on the political waters,
from arrogating to themselves the right of talking
for the nation in advance.
An enormous amount of the £750,000
owing to the Victorian Treasury as selectors’
arrears is due, not from genuine selectors but
from banks, syndicates, money-lenders and pri-
vate jobbers who have swallowed up the original
holders. The selector himself pays up reasonably
well, but the syndicate and the jobber never pay
at all. Next time Parliament is in recess a good
work would be done by summarily forfeiting
every selection which is seriously in arrears. It
would do little harm to the genuine farmer anyhow,
and it would do the Treasury a lob of good. Bub
ib would have to be done at the beginning of a
long recess ; if Parliament was sitting the
Assembly jobbers would rise as one man and cast
the Government downstairs and rescind the for-
feiture on the spot.
The administration of justice, in its initial
stage, by the ignorant, the brutal, and the preju-
diced is a scandal so enormous that future ages
will wonder how a generation content with such a
clumsy barbarism could have had the audacity to
call itself civilised. Why—when every other
public servant has to show qualification for his
duties—should the chair of preliminary justice be
filled, as often as not, by a leaden-witted lout who
has been pitchforked into it for any or every
reason bub the possession of that intellectual
acumen which is the prime requisite for even the
humblest adjudicatory function ? Nothing bub
the mutton-headed conservatism of the British
race would thus continue to apply to an over-com-
plicated social system the crude device of a time
when laws were as few as the composition of
society was simple. Uninstructed magistracy is
more than mediaeval —ib is archaic !
Bryan O’Loghlen’s defeat at Carlton (Vio.)
by the almost unknown Barrett looks as if the
hairless baronet was finally extinct. The wonder
is that he lasted so long. Poor old O Loghlen at
his best was a finesample of the wild Irish gossoon
when he wears a bell-topper and a boiled shirt,
and tries to look civilised. He would have been
an acquisition to any Irish drama, bub why the
country ever took him seriously, or how he ever
contrived to take himself seriously, are questions
that will never be answered. Bryan was the
Handy Andy of politics, and yet with all his
faults he was worth preserving. He was a fine
sample of what a politician ought not to be, and ib
would have almost been worth while to re-elect
him, so that the public might always have him
before them, and might know, by looking at him,
not to elect any more men of his sorb.
Trenwith’a grievance is the attempt to
form a Liberal Association in Victoria while there
is already the Labor and Land League, which, he
contends, is doing all the work. The old idea
exists that there must be a distinction between
the Liberal and the Radical—the Bob Lowe and
Pearson theory that provision must be made for
the men of culchaw, who sympathise with the
dim masses afar off.

Neither Parkes nor Dibbs spoke on the

The absence of the pair of chiefs was accidental,
but the fact is still remarkable.
Melb. Argus, reviewing the jusfc-published
life of the late Charles Bradlaugb, spea&s of his
“ brutal and foolish attempt to force his way into
the House of Commons m spite of the rules.”
Bradlaugh’s '‘brutality ” consisted in going to the
House to take his seat in accordance with the law,
and being thrown out and down the steps into
Palace Yard by several big policemen who tore
his coat off and strained every muscle of his body !
It is simply not the fact that he acted in spite of
the rules. He did the very opposite. The pious,
Christian House of Commons broke its own rules
in order to violently eject a wicked Atheist. The
House apologised for it afterwards, too, and ex-
punged the resolutions of expulsion from its
records. But it waited until he was on bis death-
bed to do this, and Charles Bradlaugh never knew
that he had been vindicated by and to the people
he fought for so well.
Dear Bulletin, From a democratic
standpoint there can be no doubt that the princi-
ple of paying M’s.P. for their services as such is
perfectly sound ; but the most casual observer
cannot fail to see that in its application there is
one grave defect. A remedy which suggests itself
to me is this: Render persons chosen by the
people to represent them independent of those in
possession of political power by continuing to re-
munerate them until the Parliament to which
they have been elected shall die of effluxion of
time, or until they resign, or from any cause
become legally incapacitated. lam aware that the
adoption of this course might tend to produce an
over-readiness to oust governments; but even if
it did, wmuld it not still be by far the less of
two undoubted evils ?—Yours, W. Gallagher.
[But M.’sP. don’t cling to their seats solely for
their salaries. They clung just as bard before
salaries were invented. They cling for all the
profits of Parliament—perks, influence, gratifiei
vanity, family kudos (“Pa’s a member now!”)

The really most noticeable circumstance
in Melbourne s farewell to Lord Hopetoun was its
comparative quietude. The alleged business of
the crowd was to cheer their dear departing lord
on his ’Omeward way, but most of them neglected
their duty so thoroughly that any intelligent
foreigner must have wondered why they troubled
to line the route at all. Three out of every four
of the fatuous sightseers in Collins-street restricted
their enthusiasm to a silent grin when the vice-
regal carriage passed. Lady Hopetoun’s bow was
the one thing that visibly affected the populace.
The unhappy Countess had, no doubt, made up
her mind to do the right thing once before she
retired from office, and this unprecedented bow
was the result. She sat bolt upright as ever, and
worked her head up and down with all the energy
of despair. She didn’t incline her body to the
right or the left. She simply gazed straight
before her with an unflinching shamrock eye, and
beat the air with her chin, 90 times to the minute.
Lady H.’s bow was a last public testimony to the
strange fact that she came out here in a state of
dense ignorance concerning the tricks and manners
of “exalted ” persons. Yet one might have taken it
for granted that Hopetoun’s wife saw the Princess
of Wales, and other old hands at the game, taking
part in some precious demonstration when she
tripped to London a time ago. Apparently the
colleen did not see a royal automaton at work.
Or perhaps—and this is more likely—she can’t
learn how to do it.
• * •
Lord Hopetoun was slightly under the in-
fluence of grovel for several days before he left
Melbourne, and his speeches began to be bom-
bastic. At the Town Hall dinner (where he
graciously promised to accept the first offer of an
Australian Gov.-Generalship) Hopey said : “ I
belong to the same church which my ancestors
belonged to for a good many centuries, and I am
not ashamed to say so.” Now, in the first place,
the Presbyterian Church is only four centuries
old, and, in the second place, H.E. can’t pretend
to know much about his ancestors prior to 1703,
when the family got the first taste of title.
* * *
A rather absurd fuss was made in and out
of the Melbourne press over the departure of Gov.
and Lady Hopetoun. From the wholesale manner
in which the “ departure ” ceremony was boomed
days in advance, it is no wonder that crowds of
A BURDEN OF MEAT.
BAKBLOX Postmaster: “ You're late again, Pat, there goes the
mail. ”
HORSE MAILMAN: “Och, Mr. Brown, I rode as fast as me horse
cud go.”
B. P. : “ Why don’t you get a better horse ? Oet more flesh on that
one’s bones.”
H. M. : ‘ 1 M ore flesh, is it ? Bedad, he can hardly carry what he
has on now.”
female courtiers attended the last at-home to kiss
the Countess’s vice-regal hand, or that several
thousand people gathered in Collins-street at the
eventful hour—many of them bank-clerks et hoc
genus, ostentatiously wearing the Hopetoun colors
on their hat-bands. Gov. Hopetoun was an excel-
lent fellow on the whole, but there is a little too
much rubbish talked about his liberality. Accord-
ing to some accounts, John L. Sullivan, after a
big fight in his heyday, was not a circumstance of
reckless prodigality compared with the Scotch
John Adrian. But did Lord Hopetoun ever
entertain more than Gov. Loch ? The latter’s
hop-hospitalities were unquestionably inferior to
his successor’s, but he kept open-house the whole
time to a crowd of English loafers who didn’t care
about the expense of hotel living. And surely, if
Gov. Loch, who had only his salary to live on,
could save a little at the end of his five years, the
stories of Gov. Hopetoun “ blowing ” £lO,OOO a
year above his salary are a trifle over the mark.
• # *
During the visit of a certain vice-regal
pair to an Australian country town, the landlady
of the honored pub. called upon her scowlsome
ladyship the day after the arrival and expressed
the hope that everything had proved satisfactory.
“ If it wasn’t, you’d have heard of it before now,”
was the snappy retort of “ Her Excellency.” Bub
the pub. got even in the long run, for the three
days’ bill of .£BO froze the spinal marrow of the
very “adjacent” Governor.
# » •
Hopetoun thanked the Melbourne police
before departing I have always received the
prompt assistance of all the members of the force
when I required it,” he wrote. Yes, and (this is
only a goak) the humble taxpayer has so often to
content himself with a lamp-post.
By the way, his lordship even called upon the
humble tradesman who half-soled his noble boots,
to say adieu, and express his satisfaction with the
country in general on parting.
# * #
The indecent dishonesty of a “loyal”
mob surpasses all comparison. The well-dressed
rabble who “rushed” Spencer-street station to
witness the departure of Gov. and Lady Hope-
toun barely waited till the train had steamed
away from the platform, , before they made a
delirious looting raid upon the floral decorations,
rushes, greenery, and choice pot plants, with
which the ugly place had been temporarily beauti-
fied. The women, who, a few minutes before,
had been posing in their politest society manners
before the Gov. and his wife, now bustled,
hunted and jostled each other in a mad panic of
purloining. Grovelling sycophant and greedy
snider are convertible terms.
m * •
Ex-Premier Jeames Patterson, at theHope-
toun farewell banquet: “ One of the most beauti-
ful features of their sojourn here was the manner
in which the earl and countess had engrafted
themselves on our society.” But the manner in
which “ our society ” struggled to engraft itself on
the earl and countess was much more notable.
• # •
Very significantly, the Argus leader on
Hopetoun’s Governorship and departure con-
tained not the slightest reference to the Countess.
The heroic attempt to make the poor lady popular
towards the end was a very sickly failure. Also
significant was the conspicuous absence of Lady
Clarke and Swilliam from the departure cere-
monials.

An old lady died in
Castlemaine (Vic.) the
other day. Her obituary
notice states proudly that
“ deceased was well-con-
nected in the old coun-
try, being a relation of
the late Mayor of Tor-
quay.” A provincial
Mayor in England is
nearly, but not quite as
much thought of as a
policeman in an Austra-
lian country township.

Before the present
Vic. Baby-farming Act
came in force, several
houses, almost within a
stone-throw of Melb.
Lying-in Hospital, did
a roaring business. The
nurses found out the
“good mark” who would
pay, say, .£lO or .£2O to
anyone taking the baby
off her hands, and the
“ shame ” was then ad-
vertised and sold again
for half the amount. The
baby-farmer, if up to
business, never lost sight
of the mother, and black-
mailed her regularly. It
paid a lot better than
poultry-farming.

Barter is still yery
much alive in Australian
bush townships. Shop-
keepers billet their hands
in hotels or boarding-
houses, and the proprie-
tors cut out the board-
money in groceries or
clothes. Vegetables are
exchange 1 for bread,
meat for furniture, and
so on. The local news-
paper’s employes are
each allotted an “adver-
tising ” store, where an
account is run up, and, at
the end of the month or
quarter, the newspaper-
man is debited by the
office with the amount of
his account, and the
storekeeper is credited
with so much off his ad-
vertising score. It’s
awful for the editor when
he feels thirsty several
miles away from his par-
ticular hotel.

The crowd of women who went prepared
to gush over the Hopetoun children, on Govt.
House reception-day, were disappointed. The
two youngsters had been quietly sent away with
the nurse on the previous Saturday by the mail-
boat. Lady Hopetoun preserved an unmoved face
before the visitors’ protestations of disappoint-
ment.
• • •
“ She never bowed so much all the time
she was here,” was the general comment on Lady
Hopetoun’s clockwork sort of acknowledgment of
the crowd’s farewell greetings. But the secret of
such surprising graciousness was a spring cushion ;
and her shy ladyship could no more help her bend-
ing than a doll pulled by a string can help opening
and shutting its eyes. Hopetoun is an artful dog.

Every private house in College-street,
Sydney, is now occupied by one or more
medicoes. The unpretentious residence of the
late Lieut.-Governor Stephen has fallen to
medico. St. Mary’s Cathedral stands at
one end of the street, and a druggist’s at the
other, so that it needs but the addition of an
undertaker’s and the conversion of Cook Park
into a cemetery to make College-street a really
well appointed booking-office for the Hereafter.

As stated, the late Governor Duff s funeral
will cost N.S.W. Treasury about .£4OOO. In the
U.S. even senators, if they die in office, are buried
at public expense. They are embalmed at a cost
of £l5 or £2l, and casketed and coffined at an
expense of about £7O. Kid gloves are distributed
in quantities, attendants are paid per day, car-
riages are provided for all who like to ride, and if
the senator’s body is to be taken to his home, miles
away from Washington, special Pullman cars are
set apart for the cortege, at an expense sometimes
up to £5OO. Meals, lunches and liquors are pro-
vided for all mourners, and even the church ser-
vices at the grave or vault are paid for out of the
public funds.
“After my three years’ training in the navy
during the fifties, I look upon the local gaols as
first-class boarding-houses.” Thus one Of the re-
leased N.S. W. bank-directors. “ After the luxury
of a seat inParliament, gaol is an aggregation of all
the horrors imaginable.” Thus another, which
shows that the system depends for its success upon
the early training of the subject.

One of the most pathetic examples of
civilisation’s tortures was exhibited at the theatre
the other night, when the hero of a certain
somewhat smellful banking affair sat in the
dress • circle. The play was peppered, with
allusion’s to rocky banks and cock-eyed direc-
tors, and so on, and at every such allusion
every head in the circle would turn in the direc-
tion of the fallen magnate, while the gallery
would wave like a wind-blown cornfield, and its
vanguard would hang on by its toes to get a
glimpse of the onoe-great man’s face.

A N.S. W. country school-teacher set a boy

pack of exercises, found “Jim’s ” sum unattempted

A Yic. penwoman, who wears her hair
short, relates that on a late visit to Sydney she
travelled in the same train—but not in the same
carriage—as a bride and bridegroom. She and
another girl having, however, a carriage to them-
selves, lay down on the seats and covered them-
selves with rugs. At a wayside station the people
had been told by the train-officials that there were
on board the train a bride and bridegroom, and
some intrepid loafers who walked by the car-
riages, peered into the windows. When they
saw the short-haired girl and the other one lying
on the seats, they took them for the bride and
bridegroom aforesaid, and began to “barrack.”
“ And would you believe it,” says the penwoman,
“ I had to stand up, throw off my rug, and show
them my skirts before they would go away.”
They had taken her for the bridegroom 1 If any-
one had taken her for a bride she possibly wouldn’t
have been so annoyed.

A metropolitan newspaper says on the sub-
ject of reducing the N.S.W. Governor’s salary :
“To say that there is no need for the discharge
of expensive functions is to say that the ideas and
the traditions and the observances of our social
system must be revolutionised.” .Seeing that after
most Government House “functions” the names
of the editor of that journal, and of the ladies
of his family and of his “proprietors” are all
printed in his own columns, this barefaced high-
society cry for sandwiches at the expense of Hodge
is exhilarating.

The proposal to shut up Sydney Zoo.,
based on remarks of the frightened president of
that institution, registers about the lowest notch
of the public’s conception of Governmental duty.
Modern ideas make the Government the instruc-
tor-in-chief of the nation, and what secular
instruction can educate so effectually in one im-
portant direction as the Zoo. ? So far from
shutting up the place because of insufficient out-
side support, the council of management should
apply to Parliament to have the institution placed
on the same grade as the primary schools. If pub
to a vote to-morrow, The Bulletin ventures to
say that Parliament would take this view, and
there can be no doubt of the advantage of such a
resolution.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Glare of sun in crowded* street,
Weary tread of tired feet;
Wolfish gleam in every eye,
Grasping greed is passing by.
Branded deep in every line,
Lust of power, pride of place,
Stamping out the hope divine
Nature prints on human face.
Woman —fickle, shallow, vain;
Man—full-bellied, gross, and big ;
Offspring—well, expect the same :
Human pea-hen ! human pig !
Ruling with the catching phrase
Echoed oft by servile press,
Tried and wanting—with amaze
People grasp its emptiness.
Tell me, where then is the wrong
Trampling down the toiling crowd ?
Work is thrust upon the strong,
Power is given to the loud.

If so, safe remedies are within your reach at a
nominal cost. CLEMENTS TONIC and
FLETCHER’S PILLS have never yet failed to
cure the worst cases. General debilily, nervous-
ness, weakness, and general complaints of the
digestive and nervous systems are promptly cured
by these reliable remedies. They are prepared by
scientific processes, and are not merely mechanical
mixtures made only to “gull the public.” The
renown CLEMENTS TONIC and FLETCHER’S
PILLS have won in Australasia is proof of the
fact that they stand preeminent for their special
classes of diseases. No remedies ever sold gave
such entire satisfaction to their patrons, and
evidence is forthcoming from every city, town, and
village to prove their virtues. No doubt can now
exist as to their value, but purchasers must be
careful to get the genuine articles, as many un-
scrupulous traders will attempt to palm off a
substitute if possible, for the safe of extra profit.

cremation on the sea-shore, and, therefore, the
need for a properly fitted-up crematorium becomes
all the more urgent. There is, undoubtedly, a
growing demand for cremation, but the dead
must be combusted decently and in order, and
picnic parties must not come and boil the billy
alongside the funeral pyre. Also, public opinion
is averse to the small boys of the neighborhood
being allowed to skirmish round afterwards among
the ashes in search of bones, and it holds that the
solemnity of the occasion is marred by casual
onlookers making remarks and chewing tobacco
while the operations are in progress. Cremation
on the sea-shore is altogether too suggestive of the
old British festivity of roasting a bullock whole.

F. : “ The press criticisms on the Melb.
cremation fiasco make me very tired. Every
week the bodies of a dozen decent people are
given over to maggots and nobody winces. My
splendid body shall not, provided I leave a few
dollars behind, suffer such living death. A
cremation fiasco is preferable to corruption, as
long as a clean state of ashes is reached at last.
This body of mine has been the means of most of
my pleasures and the cause of none of my troubles,
and I love it too much to share it among loath-
some crawlers. If it were attainable I might
prefer artistic embalming so that this body might
remain beautiful for ever. But, in the alternative,
I prescribe myself a poet’s obsequies, Ac dawn
my body shall be taken in a chariot with silent
tires drawn by four blood horses full speed to the
crematory. The resultant ashes shall be taken to
a place where bush and ocean meet, there to be
cast upon the wind. My dear body must have a
clean exit.”

A few years ago a very handsome and
most-talked-of Society woman disappeared from
Australia in a final cloud of scandal, in which
a scion of nobility got somehow mixed.
Her whereabouts has since been a mystery,
which is now cleared up. A man, erstwhile one of
the most intimate of her set, who has just returned
from Paris, met her there. It was at a convivial
supper, and she was “ablaze of diamonds”—a
recognised leader of that world which at one time
would not have been mentioned by men in her
presence. Her former companion went up to
greet her, but she merely stared him in the face
and moved away. The whirligig of time !

No “native” (no matter if he be Indian,
foreign labor, or Fijian) can in Fiji procure in-
toxicating liquor without a permit; and only one
or two chiefs have the necessary permits. Once,
a highly-educated Maori, dressed a la tourist,
joined a party of trippers in a “ bob-in ” at Suva,
but when it came to serving the foreigner of dark
appearance, the barmaid stammeringly asked him
(as is her legal right) for his permit. Of course,
he never heard of such a thing, and, because he
had to be content with ginger-ale, he went out,
threatening to punch Thurston’s head for classing
a Maori chief’s son with a common native and
dirty coolie. In fact, the same awkward thing
happened, it is said, to a very high and wealthy
Indian nabob on tour, who called for a bottle of
champagne.

Max O’JRell has been saying in London
that he hopes to see the day when the English
workman will drink the light wines of Australia
instead of beer and spirits. Considering that the
Australian workman, who is on the spot, never
drinks-wine, if he can help it, but always beer,
when he can get it, M. Blouet is likely to have to
wait a long time for his hope to he realised. Try
to imagine how, for instance, a British bricklayer
would look who, after a hard spell of work, was
offered a glass of chablis instead of a pot of beer !

In reality, there was only one figure at a
recent imposing Southern funeral —the undertaker.
He was good when he composed his features to
the expression of decorous grief which the occasion
demanded ; he was good when his face shone with
pride at the thought that he—HE—was “plant-
ing ” one of the most distinguished persons ever
undertaken in his province; but when his grief
and his pride mingled, when half his countenance
was in glaring sunlight and the other half in
deepest shadow, whan his nose was awry with
gloom and his mouth bubbled with exultant
jollity, then—ah, then he was irresistible.

answer. Yes; ami there are some questions that
the ablest doctors don't like to have people ask
them. Say a question of this sort —while we are
about it, however, we might as well tell the story
straight away and have done with it.
Mrs. Sarah Mace was very ill with influenza.
That was in February, 1892, the time of the
epidemic. The attack was severe. She was
suddenly seized with a violent pain in the head
(both front and back) and temples. She had pain
in all her joints, too, and was hot and feverish.
She went to bed and sent for the doctor. He came,
examined her, took her temperature —over 100
degrees—and said very little, like a wise man.
The lady could not turn herself in bed. She lived
on slops, such as milk and broth; she could not
swallow a morsel of solid food. Her husband
pressed her to take strong food, saying, “If you
don’t eat you will starve.” Right enough ; but he
forgot that when one can’t eat he can’t eat, and
there’s an end.
Well, she got weaker and weaker, and fell away
until there wasn’t much left of her but skin and
bone. Then, in her anxiety, she put her question :
“ Doctor, do you think I shall get well?"
The doctor’s answer was true and honest; we
like and respect him for it. He said, “Mrs. Mace,
Ido not know.” He couldn’t tell. Neither could
any other doctor. No ; not even if he had a string
of titles to his name as long as a kite’s tail. But
did she get well ? Wait a bit. We must hark
back a minute now.
Along about the 10th of March, 1880, Mrs. Mace
began to feel tired, languid and weary, as if her
work was too much for her, she said. She had a
bad taste in the mouth, poor appetite, and what-
ever she ate gave her pain at the chest and heart.
‘‘l had,” she continues, “a dull heavy pain at the
right side and between the shoulders, and a sinking
feeling at the pit of the stomach, and a rising of
foul gas in my throat. Later on I had rheumatic
pains in my heart, chest and back. I sent for a
doctor, who attended me for six weeks, but I got
worse. One day the cook said, * Why don’t jrou
try Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup ? ’ —this being
a medicine my mistress (I was living with a lady
in Camden Town) kept in the house for family use.
I did so, and was soon as strong as ever.
Years fied away, and in 1891 she had the first
attack of influenza, and in 1892, the second, al-
ready described in part. We now complete the
account of the 1892 attack.
Mrs. Mace says: “The doctor continued to
attend me for five weeks, and I took his medicines
for that time, but gained no strength. After hav-
ing suffered for seven weeks I said to my husband,
' I will now see what Mother Seigel’s Curative
Syrup will do for me. Perhaps it may cure
influenza as well as other ailments.’ I carried out
this resolution ; began taking the Syrup, and was
soon on my feet again, and have since kept in
excellent health, taking an occasional dose when
needed. (Signed) Sabah Mace, Monk’s Farm,
Great Warley, Brentwood, Essex, August 27th,
1892.”
Now we have never advertised Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup as a remedy for influenza. Yet
the facts stated by Mrs. Mace cannot be disputed.
What is the conclusion ? A very simple one in-
deed. She did not have influenza until her system
had been debilitated by indigestion and dyspepsia.
It is such people generally (almost wholly) that
all epidemic diseases attack. The dreaded cholera
scarcely ever touches anybody except a dyspeptic
—cholera is a malady of the bowels only. The
more we hear of disease the more the proof piles
up, showing that persons with a sound digestion
are safe against dying of anything except violence
or old age. The gyrupcured Mrs. Mace’s influenza
by taking away the ground it stood on—the tor-
pidity of her digestion.
She once asked, “ Doctor, do you think I shall
get well?” Time and Mother Seigel have said,
“Yes.”
At Poverty Point .
Dainty Deoima Moore, of the Gaiety Girlhood, comes to
Australia with the reputation of being one of the most
delightful singers and dancers on the English comic
opera stage. She is the tenth daughter of an analytical
chemist at Brighton (Gag.), and has three or four other
sisters in the front rank of the profesh. Miss Moore, who
studied under Gu rini and Carrodus, was oast as Oasilda
in the first production of “The Gondoliers,” and since
then has steadily gone ahead. She is a clever violinist
and a piquant actress, with a sweet and flexible voice and
great charm of manner. Her sister, Eva, married H. V.
Esmond, the original Cayley Drummle of “ The Second
Mrs. Tanqueray,” and Eddie Remon of “The Mas-
queraders.” Decima herself is said to be either married
or engaged to be married to a gentleman belonging to the
visiting co.
The sprightly Lottie Venne, the glorious Hayden Coffin,
and the pert Parisian, Juliette Nesville, are the only mem-
bers of the original Gaiety Girl Co. absent from the Aus-
tralian contingent.
Gaiety Girl Grace Paiotta is one of the youngest in ex-
perience of the visiting bevy of beauteous maidens. Her
only stage engagement previous to “The Gaiety Girl”
was in " Madame Angot ”at the end of ’93. She heard
some girls talking in a London ’bus about the trial of
voices at the “Cri.” She went, was heard, and was
engaged. She was horn in Vienna, but has little accent.
Her charming mezzo-soprano was trained by Randegger.
She is an intellectual maiden, with leanings towards the
legitimate drama, and fences well—which is news for
the stage-door dudes.
“ Trilby,” the play on the feet, will be seen in Aus-
tralia this year. Meanwhile, Miss Rathbone’s superb feet
are displayed, in a half-life size photo., at Falk’s Oollins-
street window. They are lovely trotters, beautifully
normal, utterly devoid of nubbly corns and the twists,
screws, and turns of fashionable boots.
A young Melb. actress has her photos, scattered about,
signed with her stage-name, but she used to sign them
with her real, name, under which she first performed. It
is a mistake to take aflotitious one, unless you are labelled
with a horror like Joshua Bugg, which the owner
changed to Norfolk Howard, so giving a new designa-
tion to a clas,s of inseotivora. See what an advantage it
is for a performer to have a name like Hayden Coffin.
How mistaken he would have been to alter it to Choi-
mondeley, instead of wreathing garlands around the, skull.
Maggie Moore, who is liberal with her cash, required,
prior to leaving Melbourne for Sydney, a big box, and on
enquiry at a shop, was asked £2 10s. for the article
required. Maggie stared with surprise, but the shopman
would not lower the figure ; so she left, and later on sent
her cabman to again price the article. The shopman,
unaware that'cabby had come from the theatre, after a
few words, let him have the trunk for 265.!
Two managers of juvenile minstrel troupes that play in
Melbourne and suburbs to “silver coin” audiences, are
sail to clear £2O each weekly after paying exs. Some of
the performers—girls and boys of 13 and 15—receive £2
10s. weekly. Grown-up members of several dramatic
companies playing to poor houses round the Melbourne
suburbs, fathers and mothers of families, who give really
good performances, have to'be content with a mere pit-
tance, sometimes amounting to 15s. or 18s. weekly.
Carlyle Smythe has arrived in Sydney as curate to the
Rev. H. R. Haweis, who is on hoard the Miowera. Fred.
Villiers will come by the next bo it fresh from the Japan-
ese war.
Marie Elster’s present intention is to put her voice
under Marchesi’s care within the next three or four
months. But she goes first to London, and may be tempted
to sta,y awhile in that rising township by the oiler of a
lucrative concert engagement.
Coppin’s clear profit over the last Maggie Moore
"Struck Oil” season amounted, it is said, to £l4OO.
They say that Bland Holt has made £5OOO at Sydney
Royal during the present season, and everyone hopes it
is true.
A great mistake in choosing the models of Living Pic-
tures is made in picking big girls. The big girl is shapely
enough when properly “ fixed up,” but she seldom or
never is made as well as her diminutive sister. It is the
Patfie Browns, the Vi Varleys, the Florence Harriotts, and
the Katie Rarrys who are tile real Venuses of the stage ;
for every large one like Sophie Harris there are a dozen
little ’uns of almost perfect symmetry. It is the same
with men. Take the boxers, for instance. Corbetts and
Jackson are each poorly-muscled in the legs; Slavin is
too thin in the waist—and so on right through the heavy-
weight division. Among the nine and ten-stoner-*, how-
ever—Jack M’Gowan, Jim Anthony, Tim Hegarty, ami
the rest—nearly every one eiiters the ring like a clear-cut
Apollo. Look at little Griffo !
Sophie Harris hounds into London popularity as Selim,
in the Crystal Palace panto. She acted here only for fun,
her people having been wealthy before the boom.
Will Birnes, a rising Melb. artist, has just sent to
Augustus Harris, London, a set of designs for an Austra-
lian ballet. It consists of 25 paintings—each one a hallet-
girl garbed to represent some brilliant Australian bird.
He is the first to think of such a thing. Not only the
exact coloring, hut the character of each bird is capitally
hit off. The scheme is original and dazzling, and Mr. and
Mrs. Dacre (Miss Amy Roselle) were greatly struck.
When Madame Bernhardt was here she slid that Mr.
Barnes was one of the most original designers she had
met, and so said Mrs. Potter.
Carlyle Smythe, the Much Travelled—his pa is now the
Most Travelled—writes for Melb. Argus an article
entitled, “If Shakespeare came to London?” VVelij and
if he did, he would inevitably be collared by the Smvthes,
father and son, for an Australian lecturing-tour. That’s
all about it.
Melbournian: “ Did Mrs. Brough ever act burlesque
here ? In London she was the masher burglar in a
travestie of the ‘Silver King.’ ”
Maggie Moore, in her Melb. playbills last year, apolo-

The pretty and shapely Nellie Ridgeway, of great high-
wire fame, is a cousin of Violet Varley.
A fairly-well-known Australian actor has invented an
appliance to raise sunken ships, an apparatus to catch
sharks by the hundred, and a contrivance to convert kero-
sene into gas.
At a Melb. concert the other night there were 25 per-

George Darrel), who has not been looking in the best of

Louise Jordan Miln’s book of travel, “ When we were
Strolling Players in the East,” is already in its 2nd
edition. Its chief illustration depicts the authoress as
Desdemona—which recalls a certain fireman’s benefit at
Melb. Opera House. The play was “ Othello,” with Miln
himself as the Moor, and Louise J. as Desdemona. In the
bedchamber scene, Miln, as always, was lugging Louise
round the room by her back-hair, when one fireman in
the pit asked his friend, “What’s the nigger trailin' her
round like that for, Bill?” To which the explanation
came ; “ Why, you fool, can’t you see the (carnation)
woman went to bed with her boots on 1 ” Truly enough,
the satin slippers of the previous scenes were plainly
visible beyond the hem of her nightdress.
Stokes Craven, who wrote “ An Innocent Abroad ” for
the opening of Edward Terry’s London season, toured for
two years in Australia with poor Phil Day. While here
he wrote “Mixed,” “ Bad Lads,” and “Hide and Seek,”
all three-act farces, for Phil.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
N.S.W. League of Wheelmen’s meeting drew a
big crowd to Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday. The
afternoon was fine and warm, and the grass track in good
order ; but a strong and gusty wind put record-beating
out of the question. The four events drew 117 competi-
tors—every province but Westralia being represented;
and that interesting hybrid, the cash amateur, had, on the
whole, a very good day out. Top money was offered in
the Sydney Wheel Race, about two miles, with £lOO, £l5,
and £5, for Ist, 2nd, and 3rd man ; whde the League Cup,
half-mile, gave a first prize of £2O, the N.S.W. Half-mile
Championship was worth £l6 and the League’s gold
medals, and there was a 1 mile Maiden Handicap to teaoh
the young idea how to spin.
The wheelmen were above the average lot. Con-
spicuous was Wyburd, the Bathurst footballer—a hairy,
brawny athlete in a black silk Jacket decked with skull
and cross-bones. Davis, the South Australian, insisted on
riding in professional tog ; and, had he won a r ice, would
have been protested against on that account. Probably
the protest would have succeeded, for the cash amateur
conscience is remarkably tender on points like this. Neil
Matterson, ex-sculler, in shining red and white, was the
tallest cyclist engaged.
In the first event, the first heat of the League
Cup, Osborne fell, destroying his own chance and that of
Lewis, who had to run wide outside the track where the
deep turf made heavy going. The heat was won by
Weaver, a much-fancied Sydney man who, favored with a
40yds. handicap, just beat Middleton, the Victorian crack.
Middleton is a Victorian miner ; he struggles terribly
when racing, working and wriggling from the crown of
the head to the sole of his foot, and trusting more to
power than skill. But a gamer man never entered a con-
test. In the second heat, Neil Matterson and Chris.
Neilsen, the two ex-scullers, both succumbed to Everitt.
Third heat was won by a maiden racer, A. J. Smith, with
the dark-horse, Payne, second. Fourth heat fell to Rath-
gen ; and fifth to' Meadham, the ex-amateur swimmer.
Sixth heat was collared by Cathie, the Victorian; Megson,
of N.S.W., finishing second with a splendid rush. The
final will be run next Saturday.
Tiie three heats and final of the One Mile
Maiden Handicap can he dismissed in a sentence, for the
race was a gift to the limit man, A. J. Smith.
For the first heat of the Half Mile Champion-
ship representatives had entered from N.S.W., Victoria,
Queensland, Tasmania, and Maoriland. Simpson, of
N.S.W., was one ; he had not had a real race since his
accident nearly 12 months ago, when he fell in the ten-
mile race with Kerr. The heat was cleverly won by
Lewis, with Simpson second, and Boyd, of Maoriland,
third. Middleton, of Vio., won the second heat, with
Megson, the N.S.W. champion, four yards behind. Mid-
dleton was plainly not husbanding his strength in the
least; he had determined to win everything. The final
was postponed till after the heats of the great race of the
day, the Sydney Wheel Race.
Bitterly were these heats contested. Neil Mat-
terson won the first, with Morton, of Vic., second. The
second was splendidly taken by Wyburd; Cathie, of Vic.,
2. Megson, who was on scratch with Davis, of S.A., gave
up after doing half the distance. The scratch men had
been handicapped out of these heats, and the game
Middleton came out for the third heat to prove it. There
was a man in front of him, Payne, with a handicap
of 150yds. The pace was fast, Middleton struggling
desperately to catch the leaders ; while all the time Payne
kept in a good place in the ruck until the critical moment
in the final lap, when he shot out like an arrow and won
by 10yds. from Middleton, who, turning his machine upon
the grass, fell of! exhausted and had to be carried in.
That terrible race did for Middleton; neverthe-
less he came out for the Half-Mile ‘Championship to race
against Megson, who had wisely drawn out of his heat in
the Wheel Race, and was now as . fresh as a lark. He
romped in, with Boyd, of Maoriland, second, and Lewis
third.
Middleton couldn’t face the final of the Wheel
Race, which was merely a repetition of Payne’s heat.
For two or three laps Cathie and Morton, the Vic. limit
men, led together, pursued by 12 others, who hung
100 yds. behind in a hunch. Then the big form of Neil
Matterson overhauled the leaders; and in the last lap
Cathie, the Victorian, was leading by 50.yds., and Matter-
son promised to come second. But, 350yds. from home,
Payne shot out again like a flish, and passed the tired
Cathie within a few yards of the post. All was over.
The League managers are delighted : they took
£6BO for the first day, and have next Saturday’s harvest
in prospect; while the two days’ expenses are only about
£6OO.

Mr. J. A. Scarr, for nearly 40 years N.S.W.
Parliamentary shorthand-writer, and for many years
handicapper to the A.J.C. and other clubs, died at Manly
Beach on Sunday last, and was on Monday followed to
the grave by a numerous assemblage of sportsmen and
members of the general public. Mr. Scarr was born at
Campbelltown in 1830, and displayed marked ability in
everything he took up. He was one of the rare men who
could touch pitch without being defiled. He preserved
an unsullied reputation throughout all his long connec-
tion with the turf, and went to his grave mourned as one
of the most kindly and chivalrous of gentlemen.

Miss Augusta Dargon, the tragedienne (in

request and w’ith her money) being in difficulties, the

Here is a startling possibility if the potentiali-
ties of turf-betting were unlimited. A punter going to
Flemington for Hopetoun farewell meeting, starting with
a pound, backing every winner, and “ playing up the
stuff” every race, would have come out thus:
odds. £.
1— Hope Stakes ..... sto 1 .. 6
2 Niddry Hurdles .. .. 6to 1 .. 42
3 Hopetoun Cup .. .. 10 to 1 .. 462
4 Holywell Steeple .. 10 to 1 .. 5082
5 Ormiston Handicap .. 10 to 1 .. 65,902
6 Bracelet Stakes .. .. 10 to I ~ 614,922
Supposing a seventh race at 10 to 1 also, he would finish
with £6,764,142. It would be easier to back seven winners
than to mark 10 in a Chinese lottery. The weak spot is
not in that, but in the fact that the market is only in-
fluenced by the amount of money invested, and not by
the merits of the spec. Form and performance are
nowhere in it.

Be the Hopetoun farewell meeting at Fleming-
ton, it was amusing to read in the Argus that “enjoy-
ment of the afternoon was marred at the close by the fact
that two good horses had to be shot on the course.” The
general public gives no heed to these little matters. At
the end of a “had day,” the enjoyment of a stone-broke
punter would not be marred by the news that all the
bookmakers present had broken their legs and been
slaughtered. * , *
Dear Bulletin, —Please allow me to con-
tradict the recent statement that Sep. Miller never
backs his horses. Every horse he starts, whether
fancied or not, carries £2O stable commission. It
his chance is really good, of course he is backed for
more. But £2O is the minimum. And it pays, too. And
now, Just here is the longlooked-for betting-system. For,
if it pays Mr. Hiller to hack thus every time, why shouldn’t
the casual punter do the same, putting, say, a pound on
each time ?—Walter S.

According to a southern paper, the Y.R.C.
committee will support the Vic. Totalisator Bill. But it
won’t be in the interests of the lamb—it is now a question
of£s. d. with the V.R.O. As The Bulletin said years
ago, the Victorian racing-fever was only a boom—when
men like White, Wallace, O’Loughlin, and others fell out
the bubble would burst. That time has now come. The
papers, bookies, and trainers now “live on the game”
direct. The papers make the favourites, the bookies own
them, and the lamb backs them. The papers exist, the
Chosen drink gold-top and drive carriages, and the lamb
walks home without the price of a long beer.

The V.R.C. is ripe for revolution. The great
hamper is that awkward provision which stops the club
from charging to the Flat, but the course is fenced in so
strictly that, whenever it gets the power, it can charge at
once. Nevertheless, the forward section of the Club
wants a start to be made with monthly meetings, or
something like that.

The English cricketers left Spencer - street
station (Melb.) as little noticed as if they had been a gang
of unemployed on their way to Kooweerup Swamp. Lord
Hopetoun happened to be leaving by the same train and
the crowd hadn’t a cheer or a hiccup to spare for the
others. People can get drunk on only one kind of emo-
tion at a time. And, anyhow, they would have been dis-
posed to regard the departure of the cricketers with the
cold dry eye of sobriety. Australia thinks a good deal
less of Stoddart’s men since they won the final test-match.
If we had beaten them, we should have liked to keep them
and console them : hut, as they heat us, the sooner they
hurry out of sight the better.

It looks as if the English cricketers had made
a special effort to end their Australian tour in ablaze
of glory. The Adelaide wicket has been generally sup-
posed unfavorable to them ; but in the final match with
S.A. they managed to put up the record score of 609,
Ward making 219, Ford 106, and Brown 101. This was
without the help of Stoddart, who is still unwell. The
South Australians did respectably enough, making 397 in
their first innings ; but, at time of writing, it looked as if
they would hardly aveit a one-innings defeat.

J. L. Sullivan isn’t dead, after all. But, for all
practical purposes, he might just as well be dead. As
Hanian was the first of the modern scullers, so Sullivan
led the latter-day glove-fighters. Sullivan was a cham-
pion in his time, and about the first exponent of the
potency of the swinging right on the point of the jaw,
hut it must be confessed that Kilrain, Ryan, Mitchell,
Burke, Smith and the men of his day were poor cattle
indeed whereon to build up such a world-wide reputation
as Sullivan enjoyed. Jack Dempsey Was looked upon in
America as simply invincible in his class—barring a
chance knock-out by La Blanche—until Australia came
along, and then “the band played Annie Rooney.” And
so it mi'iht have been with Sullivan, hut it must be con.
fessed of him that he beat all opponents until he became
a h°er-sodden and heart-diseased man. When Sullivan’s
spirit does depart it can lay to itself the unction that
whilst amongst us its owner occupied more space in th’
world’s press than any ten men the Universe has yet pro-
duced, bar none.

I have much pleasure in telling of the great benefit
I derived from Clements Tonic. During the great
influenza epidemic, like thousands of others, I had
rather a severe attack, and I consider—in fact, I
am sure—that I derived more benefit from a few
doses of Clements Tonic, than all the medicine I
had used hitherto. If people would only take my
advice they would keep it as a household medi
cine, not only as a cure for influenza, but I believe
one of the greatest preventives of the above com-
plaint. As one who has benefited by it, I am only
too happy at all times to substantiate what I have
written above. —I remain, yours, etc., Percy B.

of Walkervllle, S. Australia, writes:
“Six years ago, I had an attack of Indiges-
tion and Liver Complaint that lasted for
weeks; I was unable to do any hard work,
had no appetite, food distressed me, and I
suffered much from headache. My skin was
sallow and sleep did not refresh me. I tried
several remedies and consulted a doctor,
without obtaining any relief; finally, one of
my customers recommended Ayer’s Sarsapa-
x'illa; it helped me from the first,—in fact,
after taking six bottles I was completely
cured, and could eat anything and sleep like
a child.”

The celebrated greyhound, Fullerton, has proved
worthless for stud purposes. Experienced breeders usually
prefer the performer’s brother to the performer himself,
whose constitution and vigor seem to be affected by
training. The same rule is not observed in the turf
world, though Ormonde, despite his high price, was a
failure. The Australian Navigator, a great racehorse,
died the other day without leaving anything of note,
though he had fair chances.

Mr. D. Bernard, the well-known Sydney

Bernard’s fine collection of pictures, engravings,
and objects of art and vertu. It is Mr. Ber-
nard’s intention to conduct his business on the
most modern lines, and he announces that
students and visitors will always be welcome to his

The approach of winter has evidently pro-
duced much activity in the creative minds of
fashionable artistes. Young ladies’ evening cos-
tumes are going to be very pleasant to the eye, at
least if one may take those seen at Messrs. Hichs,
Atkinson and Sons’establishment in Collins-street,
as a criterion. This firm, however, it seems, has
opened new dressmaking rooms specially to cater
for the younger generation, and the combination
of interestingly low prices, elegant taste and high-
class finish will be appreciated by the youth of
social Melbourne. *
Paikes’ appearance as president of the
little crowd (including the inevitable Knapp and a
lot of parsons) who attended at Sydney Temper-
ance Hall “ to protest against further delay in
Local Option legislation ” was a most piteous cir-
cumstance. The veteran trimmer is now living
on mice. “ I have great pleasure in taking the
chair,” he said, “ though I am not here as a total
abstainer.” It recalls what he used to say of yore
at Orange celebrations : “ I have great pleasure,
&0., but I am not nor have I ever been an Orange*
man ’’-—and then in your mind’s eye you could see
him put his fingers to his nose and softly wink.
“I do not identify myself with the Local Option
movement as an opponent or as a person
advocating any unneighborly feeling against the
persons engaged in the liquor-traffic (derisive
laughter). What has that idiot to laugh at?”
Well, that idiot was probably laughing at the
idea of the ancient and plausible deceiver who had
played see-saw until he wore out the middle of the
plank, and w r ho never felt so comfortable or
appeared to such good advantage as when he had
two bottles of sparkling Burgundy and a roast
duck under his belt, having the cast-iron im-
pudence to stand up in public and snuffle that
“they knew that the consumption of intoxicating
drinks was not necessary to the health and real
enjoyment of any human being under the sun.

ENG’S “FRUIT SALT.”—“I have recently
returned from a trip to Malta in the P. and O.
Company’s ships, and consider it a duty incum-
bent upon me to make known to you that during
a nautical career extending over a period of 30
years, I have been invariably a sufferer from sea-
sickness, more or less, according to the weather;
but on the last occasion I am happy to say
(although we experienced strong head winds and
heavy sea crossing ‘ The Bay ’) I entirely escaped ;
and this I attribute to my having provided myself
with your invaluable ‘FRUIT SALT,’ which I
can most conscientiously recommend to all who
may be similarly afflicted, whose business or
pleasure may cause them to * go down to the sea
in ships.’ You can make whatever use you may
please of this, and trusting that I may be the
means of extending the benefits of your panacea,
I remain, Sir, yours faithfully, D. S. Lkese, late

the numerous flattering applications from inventors and investors alike, convince the management
that there is room for the extension of its operations over a much wider field than was at first content*

to a development fund-in this case of .61000 in 1000 shares of £1 each. This provides the second

safe speculation, and one certain to bring in very handsome returns. It is anticipated that the sales
of patent rights and licenses to manufacture the invention selected (which is an article of everyday use
in every household) will produce a nett return of from one to three million pounds sterling, and that
it will commence to pay handsomely immediately the patents are fully secured, giving a dividend
exceeding the original subscription within six months.
The invention is perfected, and patents are being secured in every part of the world. Ihe turn s
subscribed are used exclusively for this purpose. No part of the fund goes to inventor until net •
profits are declared, of which he takes one-third.

A case of extra-uterine gestation is re-
ported by Dr. Bakins, of Eohuca (Vic.), in the
Marcli Medical Gazette. A living, healthy
child was delivered by opening the abdomen, and
the mother was well on the way to recovery when,
out of morbid curiosity, she removed the antisep-
tic dressing and died 17 days after the operation.
A Westralian police-magistrate was sitting
on his verandah one Sunday morning recently,
wondering whether it was time to get ready for
church, when a man came running up the road,
dashed in the gate, and breathlessly appealed to
the P.M. for protection from an enemy who wished
to assault him. The magistrate hadn’t time to
collect his thoughts ere the pursuer came panting
up and made straight for the first-comer, who
ran through the open door of the house into the
parlor, and tried to hide under the sofa. He was
dragged out, however, before he got half-way
under, and a fearful battle ensued all over the
sacred precincts. The beak, in great consterna-
tion, rushed into the street to look for assistance,
which was cheerfully refused him by the only man
in sight. After every article of furniture had
been tumbled over about 307 times, the pursued
one, bleeding profusely, managed to escape into
the g irden, where several more rounds were fought
among the flower-beds, while the majesty of the
law stood on the verandah with terror on its
countenance and vainly implored the combatants
to desist. Just then some of the beak’s friends
came past on their way to church, and the battle
was at last cut short; but the magistrate, who
spent the rest of the day in sorting out the debris,
has never been able to convince his shepherd that
he didn’t attend church that Sunday morning
because he was amusing himself by inciting a fight
between two drunken pugilists.

Testimonials.
I, THOS. MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 547 George-street, Sydney, in the Colony of
New South Wales, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows :
Whereas I suffered severely from a very troub’e some affection of the Nerves, which
affected me so much that I was quite unable to attend to my business. I tried several doctors
and many remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas I, as a last hope, obtained some of Herr
Rassmussen’s Purely Herbal “Alfaline
Vitality Pills,” which I hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare Completely Cured Me with-
in a few weeks, and although this is over five
years ago I have remained well ever since.
The Alfaline Pills also cured my wife, and
I make this solemn declaration conscientiously
believing the same to be true.

and, in consequence, I have recommended them
to many friends, who have all been cured by
their use. —Yours, R. A. LUCKHAM.

Sir, —I hereby beg to certify that having
been a sufferer from General Debility of the
Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the

I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses
of the Alfaline Remedies I am now completely
cured, and I shall be most happy to recom-
mend your remedies to anyone suffering as I
was. Thanking you for your courtesy and

’E dunno w’ere ’e are !
Dr. Haynes (formerly of Sydney), captain
of Perth (W. A.) cavalry corps, emphatically
denies that he fell from his horse during
■Gov. Kintore’s visit to Perth. The doctor
has evidently developed into a most patriotic
Westralian. “ About the escort,” he writes; “It
is certainly equal to any I have seen in the adjoin-
ing provinces, and although the members be West
Australians they are as fine a body of men as will
be found anywhere, and their mounts are equally
good. There are a mean class of people over here
from the Eastern provinces who delight to ridicule
and libel the West Australian native, but it would
be well for them to imitate and not despise him.
I learned to ride many a long year ago as a
N.S.W. native brought up in the bush.”

Professor TODD, Anderson’s College Medical

writes:—
“It is lighter, clearer and more ethereal oil than
any I have hitherto used, besides being free from
the heavy nauseous odour characteristic of others.
“This is particularly noticeable when the oil is
sprayed into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally,
which places it above other preparations, and con-
siderably enhances its value.

“ It is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to tell you of the
great benefit my little daugh-
ter Gladys has derived from
‘Benger's Food.' The doctor
and all who saw her thought
we should never he able to
rear her. We took her to the
hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended * Ben&er’s
Food.’ From that time she
began to pick up flesh and
strength.”
If every mother knew of
its value no other would be
used.”
A civil-servant of Maryborough (Q.), by
the death of a relative in Great Britain, recently
came into possession of two estates in Wexford,
and valuable property in Regent-street, London.
A woman has applied for a hangman’s
billet in Austria, contending that as woman brings
man into the world she has a right to hoist him
out again. Two wrongs make one right?
It is said that the small veiled female who
has lately stabbed several women in the neighbor-
hood of South Kensington, London, is no other
than a certain titled lady who has been under
restraint for years, and who escaped her keepers.
She has been again secured under lock and key.
Her husband tried long ago to get rid of her, but
for some reason he did not succeed. So a certain
dancer, whom we all know, awaits the natural
course of events to wear a coronet by right.
Dear Bulletin, —Ah.Kow, of Mudgee,
and other correspondents who enthuse over the
geniality, the courtesy and kindness to women, of
the yellow hawker of pestilent “ cabbagee ” and
infected “ letioee,” are as much deceived by the
guileful pagan as those women who buy leprosy-
p ppered vegetables from Sin Fat, because Sin is
s ) suave and deferential, and smiles and giggles,
and babbles in a soft low voice, and is always
squirming in saponaceous humility. Sin Fat is
only meek and crawlsome so long as it suits him,
and can work up a particularly demoniacal scowl
when turned away once or twice from a house
where he was accustomed to do business. I have
seen a Chow hawker, infuriated by such treatment,
stand out upon the road and heap oriental curses
upon the house from door-step to chimney-pot,
with appropriate gesticulation. In any case, Sin’s
g d Ian try and tenderness are nauseous, and the
roughest thing that can be said of the Australian
housewife is that she declines to deal with the
white and wholesome vegetable-hawker because he
will not abase himself before her, and wriggle like
a dung-worm every time she invests in a bunch of
carrots or a peck of peas. The woman does not
expect her butcher to be a fawning sycophant, nor
her grocer, nor draper : why should she ask it of
licr vegetable man? I do not believe she does.
The Australian housewife deals with the Chow
h -cause she is ignorant, and because John comes
handiest. —E.D,

The name of “Shanty” Rooney, a sub-
contractor on one of the early N.S.W. railway
lines, is historic. His method was simple : While
he ran the contract his wife presided over the
attached pub., and he retired worth many thou-
sands. A specimen scene on the weekly pay-day :
“Logan.” “Here Oi am.” “And how much
di ye lave wid th’ ould woman last pay ?” “ Well,
Mr. Rooney, av coorse Oi had a dhrop wid the
bhoys, but there’s an ould father as well’s a woife
and little childher down below.” “Ayah, well
well, there’s yer shtuff, and Oi don’t think Oi can
kape yer goin’ any longer ; sure the job’s about
done, and there’s no more contracts cornin’awhoile
yet. Maguire!” “ Yis, Mr. Rooney.” “And
phwat did ye lave wid th’ould woman?” “Bedad
and Oi left the lot, and Oi never kem away till me
pockets wuz inside out.” “’Tis well, me bhoy,
that yer doin’, and there wuz niver a man on the
job that plazed me more than yer own self.
There’s your pay.” “Ragan, Ragan, anyone see
Martin Ragan ? Oh, yer there, are ye, Martin,
and how does you and the missus stand?” “Faith
it’s on the wrong soideOi’rn thinkin’, Mr. Rooney,
smz haste wake.” “Yis, yis, so she tould me,
but don’t let that trouble ye, there’s your money,
and ye’ll take some min wid ye and titivate up the
fais av the cuttin’, and give an oi to the culvert
beyant. And don’t distriss yeasilf, but see that
the nst does their whack.” Erin-go-bragh !

The landlord was asked by the tenant, who had
built up a good business, if he would object to transfer the
lease, as he was about to sell out. The landlord dis-
claimed any objection, but when seller had signed his
covenant, refused to effect the transfer unless £1 a week
more rent was paid. The vendor had to pay this in a
lump sum to avoid a suit for breach of agreement with
the purchaser. But good old Nemesis has made it right.
The new man went bung, and the shop is empty ; the
landlord was a big investor in a land-bank and increased
his holding by buying more shares with the above lump
sum, and vendor is negotiating with the liquidator to buy
the shop for a song by means of deposit-receipts got
at a big discount.

almost all their canvassers. The second-hand machine-

being picked up at sales for a song, and, with a little
repair, made equal to new, thus enabling a good machine
to be sold at half the price of a new one. The profits in

let him sell. The leading stope proved that the shoot of
gold didn’t go up, and a little picking along the floor
showed that it didn’t go down—and so a mine, apparently
good value for £20,000 or £30,000, proved to be worth not
so many hundreds. The moral is ancient. Many a mine

I signalled him up, and, receiving the “All right,”
started to wind. The morning had been windy, and just
when I was expecting to see Jack’s head heave in sight,
an extra-strong blast knocked over the above-mentioned
tree. I viewed the falling mast, and then, with great pre-
sence of mind, bolted —deciding to let Jake take his
chance. The tree struck the windlass-barrel and sent the
w'hole concern down the shaft. I listened for the dull,
sickening thud and heard it—also, various other noises,
profane mostly. Bat Jack wasn’t hurt a bit —not
being in a hurry for lunch he had filled the bucket with
quartz, which, being rich in mineral, seemed to me quite
as heavy as a man at the end of the rope.—Golden Bugle,

On the Plains ,
(MAORILAND).
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Alone with the silence, the sun and sky.
Alone on the tussocky plain I lie.
An ocean of yellow from East to West
Still rolling and sweeping, far crest on crest;
And billow on billow the tussocks bend
Until in one shimmering haze they blend ;
Where, under the distance, the heat and noon,
The plains, in an ecstacy thrilling, swoon
And melt in the yellow-tinged sombre air,
Like perfume from roses on evenings rare !
Where the sky and the misty horizon meet
The flax-bushes float like a far-off fleet.
And slowly th«y swim with no spray nor splash,
While swell their green sails and their brown oars
flash !
So, lost in two oceans —of plain and sky—
Full-length on the tussocks alone I lie!

and the murderer, John Taw ell, once a philan-

his mistress prussic acid at Saltash (the house was
standing three years ago), near Slough, went by
train to Paddington and was met there by a
detective, who went in the same omnibus with
him to the Jeru-alem coffee-house which Tawell

“Rick the treasure , sweet the pleasure■ sweetest pleasure after pain."

44 IT TOUCHES THE SPOT.’-Aye, that is what ‘Homocea 5
does. And does it quickly too—whether it’s a toothache or
neuralgia, with all their shooting pains, or eczema, with its
painful and distressing irritation. Rheumatism in the joints or
muscles has been cured, even of years’ standing while for
cuts, burns, and bruises it is far ahead of any ointment that has ever been
before the public.
LORD GARRICK
says ‘Homocea 5
cured him of He-
morrhoids, when
all else failed ; that he gave some to a labourer who was rendered quite lame
by a stone falling upon him, and it cured him in four
days. A woman had a pain in the elbow and could
not bend it for a year, and it cured her, and another
used it for a bad leg, and it was doing her good.
One letter closes from him with the words, “It is the
most wonderful stuff 1 ever came across. 55
LORD COMBERMERE says that he
found “ Homocea did him more good
than any other embrocation he had ever
used for rheumatism.
Remember that “ Homocea” subdues inflammation and allays irritation almost as soon as applied.

Starting the Selection .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It’s twenty years ago now since we settled on the
Creek. Twenty years ! I remember well the day
we came from Stanthorpe, on Jerome’* dray—
eight of us, and all the things—beds, tubs, a
bucket, the two cedar chairs with the pine bottoms
and backs that Dad put in them, some pint-pots
and old Crib. It was a scorching hot day, too —
talk about thirst! At every creek we came to we
drank till it stopped running.
Dad didn’t travel up with us : he had gone some
months before, to pat up the house and dig a
waterhole. It was a slabbed house, with shingled
roof, and space enough for two rooms ; bat the
partition wasn’t up. The floor was earth ; but
Dad had a mixture of sand and fresh cow-dung,
which housed to keep it level. About once every
month he would put it on; and everyone had to
keep outside that day till it was dry. There were
no looks on the doors : pegs were put in to keep
them fast at night; and the slabs were not very
close together, for we could easily see through
them a person coming on horseback. Joe and I
used to play at counting the stars through the
cracks in the roof.
The day after we arrived Dad took mother and
us out to see the paddock and the flat on the other
side of the gully that he was going to clear for
cultivation. There was no fence round the pad-
dock, but he pointed out on a tree the surveyor’s
marks, showing the boundary of our ground. It
must have been fine land, the way Dad talked
about it! There was very valuable timber on it,
too, so he said ; and he showed us a place, among
some rocks on a ridge, where he was sure gold
would be found, but we weren’t to say anything
about it. Joe and I went back that evening and
turned over every stone on the ridge, but didn’t
find any gold.
No mistake, it was a real wilderness —nothing
but trees, “goannas,” dead timber, and bears;
and the nearest house—Dwyer’s—was three miles
away. I often wonder how the women stood it
the first few years; and I can remember how
mother, when she was alone, used to sit on a log,
where the lane is now, and cry for hours. Lonely !
It was lonely.
Dad soon talked about clearing a couple of acres
and putting in corn—all of us did, in fact—till the
work commenced. It was a delightful topic before
we started ; but in two weeks the clusters of fires
that illumined the whooping bush in the night,
and the crash upon crash of the big trees as they
fell, had lost all their poetry.
We toiled and toiled clearing those four acres,
where the haystacks are now standing, till every
tree and sapling that grew there was down. We
thought then the worst was over ; but how much
we knew of clearing land ! Dad was never tired
of calculating and telling us how much the crop
would fetch if the ground could only be got ready
in time to put it in ; so we labored the harder.
Witli our combined male and female forces and
the aid of a sapling lever we rolled the thundering
big logs together in the face of Hell’s own fires;
and wiien there were no logs to roll it was tramp,
tramp, the day through, gathering armfuls of
sticks, while the clothes clung to our backs with a
muddy.perspiration. Sometimes Dan and Dave
(they were the oldest—17 and 15) would sit in the
shade beside the billy of water and gaze at the
small patch that had taken so long to do ; then
they would turn hopelessly to what was before
t hem and ask Dad (who would never take a spell’
What was the use of thinking of ever getting
such a place cleared ?” And when Dave
wanted to know why Dad didn’t take up a place
on the plain, where there were no trees to
grub and plenty of water, Dad would cough as if
something was sticking in his throat, and then
curse terribly about the squatters and political
jobbery. He would soon cool down, though, and
get hopeful again.
“Look at the Dwyers,” he’d say; “from ten
acres of wheat they got .£7O, last year, besides
feed for the fowls; they’ve got corn in now, and
there’s only the two.”
It wasn’t only burning-off ! Whenever there
came a short drought the water-hole was sure to
run dry ; then it was take turns to carry water
from the springs—about two miles. We had no
draught-horse, and if we had there was neither
water-cask, trolly, nor dray ; so we humped it—
and talk about a drag ! By the time you returned,
if you hadn’t drained the bucket, in spite of the
big drink you’d take before leaving the springs,
more than half would certainly be spilt through
the vessel bumping against your leg every time
you stumbled in the long grass. Somehow, none
of us liked carrying water. We would sooner
keep the fires going all day without dinner than
do a trip to the springs.
One hot, thirsty day it was Joe’s turn with the
bucket, and he managed to get back without
spilling very much. We were all pleased because
there was enough left after the tea had been made
to give each a drink. Dinner was nearly over;
Dan had finished, and was taking it easy on the
sofa, when Joe said :
“I say, Dad, what’s a nater-dog like?” Dad
told him. “ ifellow, sharp ears and bushy tail.”
“Those muster bin some then thet I seen—l
don’t know ’bout the bushy tail—all th’ hair had
corned off.” “ Where’d y’ see them, Joe?” we
asked. “ Down ’n th’ springs floating about—
dead.”
Then everyone seemed to think hard and look
at the tea. I didn’t want any more. Dan
jumped off the sofa and went outside; and Dad
looked after mother.
At last the four acres—excepting the big-
gest of the iron-bark trees and about fifty stumps
were pretty well cleared; and then came a problem
that couldn’t be worked-out on a draught-board.
I have already said we hadn’t any draught horses ;
indeed, the only thing on the selection like a horse
was an old “ tuppy ” mare that Dad used to
straddle. The date of her foaling went further
back than Dad’s, I believe; and she was
shaped something like an alderman. We found
her one day in about 18 inches of mud, with both
eyes picked out by the crows, and her hide bearing
evidence that a feathery trib3 had made a roost of
her carcase. Plainly, there was no chance of
breaking up the ground with her help. We had
no plough, either ; how then was the corn to be
put in ? That was the question.
Dan and Dave sat outside in the corner of the
chimney, both scratching the ground with a chip
and not saying anything. Dad and mother sat
inside talking it over. Sometimes Dad would get
up and walk round the room shaking his head ;
then he would kick old Crib for lying under the
table. At last mother struck something which
brightened him up, and he called Dave.
“ Catch Topsy and ” He paused because he
remembered the old mare was dead.
“Run over and ask Mister Dwyer to lend me
three hoes.”
Dave went; Dwyer lent the hoes ; and the prob-
lem was solved. That was how we started.

“ Idle Singers of an Empty Day.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Must a poet sing in the days that are here
Only of moons and roses,
And lips, and limbs of a last loved dear
Pictured in pretty poses?
Is there nothing then that a man may sing,
Who singebh in those last ages,
But themes that are worn, or scenes that are torn
Out of the dead Past’s pages ?
They are gone—your Arthur and Guinevere —
Gone from the world for ever ;
If ever they were, they are not now here —
Songs can recall them never.
The cruel, cold Past is gone at last.
Laden with sin and sorrow;
What serve your wails and your old-world tales ?
Sing of To-day and To-morrow.
This iron age, with its iron life,
Sombre with sweat and curses,
And the ominous stillness of pending strife,
Hath it no theme for verses ?
And the day new-born, and the light of the morn,
Breaking on brightened faces,
And righted wrongs—herein are songs
Better than languid graces.
Poets, the voices of dawn are heard I
Loudly announce the morning ;
Now is the fight so long deferred,
Sound ye the battle warning.
Sing victory won, and long strife done,
Unto each man that liveth ;
Sing life in the light, and equal right
To all that the good world giveth.

I’ll get you some of mine.” The man said
nothing, but gritted his teeth and got through the
job. Next day, wife announced her intention of
going to spend a fortnight with her mother—
“thought a change would do her good.” Hus-
band agreed, and saw her off cheerfully. Wife
came back: found furniture sold, husband gone,

A tremendous “reform” in Victorian
railway management is heralded by three-stick
pars in the local press. In future, with a view to
the economy of power and fuel, engine-drivers are
to avail themselves of momentum in climbing
high grades. “The use of momentum,” says the
Age, “is now being thoroughly applied.”" The
engine-driver now rushes a hill that he formerly
approached with diffidence at a two-raile-an-hour
gait. In effecting this reform “the departmental
authorities are acting on the scientific basis that a
moving train is in itself a reservoir of force that
can be utilised in supplementing the active motive
power.” The world does move.

Dear Bulletin, —Lindsey Cooper (The

recently retired from that paper after 56 years’
service. As a matter of fact, his actual service
extended over only 50 years, and it is just 55 years
since he joined the paper. He did not come out to
S.A. with the first proprietor, Robert Thomas,
and did not assist to bring out the first number in
a tent in Holdfast Bay. When the paper was
printed under primitive conditions in ’37, Cooper
was, perhaps, shrinking from the dominie’s cane.
He came out here as a small boy, and in 1840 he
was apprenticed to Robert Thomas, being then a
youngster of 13. The first number of The Regis-
ter, with which Mr. Cooper was for so long
honorably connected, was published in London in
1836, and the second issue took place a year later
in Adelaide, not at Holdfast Bay.—Yours, &0.,
