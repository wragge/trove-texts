Some people prefer solitude to society.
They like the wide open spaces of the
earth where breezes blow. Where the sky
comes down to meet the valleys. Where
the mountains climb up to the blue.
No matter whether you travel for bust-
ness or the sheer love of adventure, take
a Decca with you. It can be carried as
easily as an attache case, and yet is
staunch enough to stand the roughest
handling, while its clear and beautiful
tone will bring the music of civilisation to
you in’the remotest corners of the earth*

Honi soit qui mal y pense
Alnieric Fitzroy is a scion of the dneal
house of Grafton, a house which owes the
rayal arms on its scutcheon to Charles 11.
and its bar sinister to Nell Gwynn. He has
spent a lifetime in or about the Court of
St. James, and 25 years of it (1898-1923)
as Clerk of the Council. His duties led him
into other spheres, but never far from the
Very Exalted. He retired full of years and
discretion in 1923, and all those years and
all that discretion have combined to produce
Memoirs (2 vols., Hutchinson).
After a short Biographical Note we find
ourselves at Windsor in 1898. The mot
d’ordre is “waiting.” The Queen holds her
Ministers in protracted private audience
while the rest stand about in the corridor
admiring the museum of the Hanoverian
dynasty. Dinner at the castle is served at
9.15. The business lasts an hour; then the
Queen rises and all follow to the drawing-
room. Here persons not of royal rank range
themselves alongside some convenient piece
of furniture, at an awful distance from the
Queen, and talk energetically to each other.
lI.M. selects from the group some favorite
for intimate conversation, but is apt to be
overcome with postprandial somnolence.
Finally she rises, and with a bow to her
guests passes out of the room on the arm
of her Indian attendant. We have glimpses
of her at the Council table. A pen is miss-
ing from the inkstand, and without it the
Proclamation canndt be signed. There is a
hush until her Majesty observes: “It is very
funny there is no pen.” Then someone goes
from the chamber to look for one. The
sheriffs roll is "pricked” with a bodkin—a
survival from the time when the rulers of
England were mightier with sword than pen
—so the new clerk designs a mechanical
device to take its place. The Queen fears
a derogation of her privileges. Her suspi-
cions are removed, and someone writes:
"Great success! The machine is approved
of. H.M. thinks it is rather nice, so please
bring it on 7th.” However, at the last
moment she shrinks from using the appara-
tus, and continues with the time-honored in-
strument.
_ Victoria passes: a new era is introduced.
No one remembers a coronation, so records
have to be examiued. All sorts claim the
hereditary privilege of carrying some portion
of the King's regalia. This necessitates a
Court of Claims. Someone decides that
peeresses should not wear diamonds, so natu-
rally the sentiment of the sex favors dia-
monds. A revolt is imminent; they are con-
ceded tiaras provided they put coronets on
top of them. The Dean and Chapter of West-
minster are “pained” by the Order of Coun-
cil giving possession of the Abbey to the Earl
Marshal during the coronation. Norfolk
himself is pressed by Canon Gore to sym-
pathise with them, to which the Duke replies
that his sympathies are all with the Bene-
dictine Monks, whom the Anglican body dis-
possessed. However, the new King is safely
crowned, and we return to a freshened atmo-
sphere in the Council chamber. Councils
are again held at Buckingham Palace for
the first time “within living memory,” and
Edward VII. brings a certain amount of his
breezy bonhomie to lighten the 'weight of
the deliberations. The predominant charac-
teristic of the new monarch seems to be
acute perception in matters of lie
sees Teck in the uniform of a British colonel,
and his face suddeuly assumes “a fixed look.”
“Francis has got on the wrong buttons,” re-
marks H.M. to a companion inquiring the
cauße of the royal displeasure. But the
“most extraordinary” proof of this minute-
ness of observation is vouchsafed to the
author himself at Windsor. The King in
passing him. on leaving the dining-room,
pauses to remark: “You have not got your
embroidered waistcoat!” To which Fitzroy
replies: “Your Majesty remembers that!"
The royal memory had held the garment in
recollection over a period of six years.
The King is apt to prove rather elusive
in the matter of Councils, and on one occa-
sion the faithful clerk travels 500 miles in
24 hours to assist at a ceremony that lasts
ten seconds. But the most illuminating
event of the reign occurred at the Opera
House. Someone was evidently “talking
shop” (in the interval, presumably), and the
King protests that he will never consent to
the taxation of the food of the poor. The
discussion started on the Motor Bill. The
King says: “You must tax them; I am all
in favor of taxing the rich.” Someone
queries: “Your Majesty does not approve
taxing the food of the poor?” “No.” replied
King, “and I do not care who knows
it!” On which Devonshire turns to Balfour
of Burleigh and says: “We must really get
this man on the stump!”
King Edward passes, and the business of
accession and coronation is gone through
again. We sit at the Council table with King
George during the next 13 years, impressed
by a monarch who unceasingly strives to
perform his duty. He lacks the occasional
brilliance of his sire and a great deal of the
institutional impressiveness of his grand-
mother. but we feel he is sounder than either.
Somewhere in 1912 we hear of a Privy Coun-
cillor and his kinsfolk discussing the pros-
pects of European war. One says to the
other: “It. will be a terrible thing if me
English go to war with us Germans!” On
July 28 the menace of European war comes
with “startling abruptness.” From new side-
lights we glean little. Councils have still
to he held, and when TT.M. is incapacitated
hy his injury in France, Commission under
the Great Seal empowers his consort to hold
( ouncils in his behalf. In 1916 Mr. Hughes
Prime Minister of Australia, calls on the
clerk in the morning. Re is struck by his
air of “energetic effectiveness,” and finds
him an apt pupil for the hand-kissing, knee-
bending erroroony. On the next day he per-
forms bis part “very creditably,”' and flu-
King detains him—"opening the conversa-
tion by a pretty compliment to bis vivid
.Joquenoe.” In Mar. 1018, French goes to
Ireland, and we travel from Windsor in the
suine compartment. Re is going to enforce
conscription even if he has "to deluge the
country with blood.” Our clerk observes:
"Though he is an Irishman by descent, his
knowledge of the people is partial in extent,
and superficial at that.”
The war ends, and we are assured that
only “one end was possible.” We continue
the social round. “Melba is accorded almost
royal honors, which seemed superfluous even
as the prize of either aspect of her high
calling. ’ She bears the Cross of St. John
of Jerusalem on her bosom, which she told
an American had been given her by the
King. “What,” said the stupid man, “the
King of Jerusalem?” We meet a reveller
from the Peace Conference who has a “nice”
story illustrative of Clemenceau’s wit. A
study of the English newspapers brings to
the Tiger’s notice the interest taken in Eng-
land to arrest venereal disease, as to which
ho asks some information from Arthur Bal-
lour. Balfour tells him briefly of a Royal
Commission which had just concluded its sit-
ting on the subject. “Ah, mon chcr Bal-
four,” he replied, “it is to make the demi-
monde safe for democracy.”
Now the King’s Speech is approved with-
out the preliminary of a Council—a step
which years ago Victoria denounced as “re-
volutionary.” The Irish question has been
"'settled' by the Welsh attorney; and our
(Jerk of the Council is about to re-
tire. The curtain falls on his offi-
cial life, and he attends his last Council,
liis 418th. Throughout the 814 pages of his
ponderous volumes our interest has been
kept alive in expectation of what was to
come. But now we know that if he had any
information.whichVe thought he should give
us—well, he knows that such things are
simply not done.
GERALD DILLON.
The Australian Stage in 1925
Brunetihre, the French critic, maintained
that renascence of the drama always fol-
lows an outburst of national energy such
as the successful waging of a war. Hence
the Greeks took to writing good plays be-
cause they had dished the Persians and felt
good about it; and England begot Shaks-
peare as a consequence of sinking the
Armada. If the theory has anything in it,
Australia should now be enjoying a revival
of the mummer's art second to none in his-
tory.
A controversy was lately conducted here
concerning the Australian stage. As one
who has attended every play presented in
the two principal metropoli during the de-
parted year I have only one fault to find
with the Australian stage. There isn’t any.
I exclude from this review the noble efforts
of those repertorians who have aired a few
works by native playwrights because, rightly
or wrongly, I hold that a movement appeal-
ing to a small band of dilettanti and per-
formed in the hothouse atmosphere of liter-
ary coteries is not a living stage. Until the
repertory movement can come out of its
obscurity and challenge the ground-renters
and profiteering combines on their own field,
it can have little effect in influencing the
taste of the theatre-going millions.
1 confine myself therefore to the commer-
cial theatre entirely preoccupied with im-
ported drama. Only one patriot with an
Australian company kept the banner of high
art flying during 1025. That was Allan
Wilkie. He had only one competitor in his
own field—the Russian-Jew Moscovitch.
This gentleman is. a subtle and tempera-
mental actor, but his one Shakspearean
essay—-“ The Merchant":—was received with
only moderate enthusiasm, possibly because
his interpretation was more Continental than
the robust and British style of Allan Wilkie
He also introduced us to “The Outsider,”
modern drama in which an unlicensed bone
setter triumphs over the trades-union of
practitioners. This play was stated to hav
been written by- a woman whose eripplec
frame had been straightened by an irregu
lar of medicine. Some of her fire got into
the play and saved it from being purelj
propaganda. It earned the applause o’
those who have lost their faith in doctors
and incurred the disapprobation of Mac
quarie and Collins streets. It had a fail
run ; but the tour was, I understand, a finnn
cial failure.
The next outstanding event was the visit
of the film actress Pauline Frederick. Thou
sands flocked to see a lady in three dimen
sions whom previously they had known in
only one. She staged two plays, “Spring
Cleaning.” a sermon by Frederick Lonsdale
on the well-known text that if a sedentary
husband gives more attention to his books
than to his wife, she is apt to look for notice
elsewhere; and “The Lady,” by Martii
Brown, in which an unsophisticated sou
brette of the provincial boards in Euglam
bolts with a wealthy youth because she
imagines he combines high rank with shekels
finds he is a commoner like herself, leaves
him and subsequently is shoved by the long
arm of coincidence into the presence of hei
sou and takes him to America to prevent
him being brought up in the family of his
father. To bring this fragment of stock
melodrama up to date the playwright
sprinkled i.t, with curse words and dragged it
by tlie hair into a brothel. Its sponsors tried
it on .Melbourne with disastrous results,
and evidently believing that the southern
city s verdict was merely an expression
of old-maidenly surprise, tried it on
Sydney—with similar effect. Neverthe-
less both Miss Frederick and her employers
are said to have done well by her visit. Pos-
sibly the romantic fact that the tear which
Pauline shed a year ago could be seen tremb-
ling on her celluloid check in Castlereagh-
streot. while the real phononnrivui could he
?een at the same time in Pittistreet, contri-
buted to her popularity.
That veteran but charming combination,
the Vanbrugh-Rouei'canlts, presented some
new plays by A. A. .Milne, and fwinc old ones
by Pineiro: The new plays mere given to
loquacity, which seems to be a .modern fail-
ing : and the old ones shone alujve them in
the matter of stagecraft, if in nothing else.

FROM the West, the Marlborough White Horse—
cut out in 1804 —can be seen on the slope of
the hill to the right of the High Road.
Like most of the other Wessex White Horses, the
White Horse of Marlborough is emblematic of victory
or of some noteworthy event. Its care and preserva-
tion have been the proud charge of each succeeding
generation.
The cc White Horse ” tradition is shared also by that
White Horse which has symbolised Scotland’s finest
Whisky since 1746. From generation to generation
the Distillers have maintained the excellence and great
age of WHITE HORSE Whisky, which has won
for it the approval of connoisseurs all over the world.

Their producers did not, like the author of
“The Outsider,” aim at something beyond
their powers. They shot their arrows at a
moderate objective. It is in a sense a nega-
tive objective, and a glance about the stalls
or the circle on a first night will at once
reveal it. It is at all costs not to interfere
with the mastication of chocolate softs A
play to satisfy this requirement must contain
only a modicum of story, a multitude of ex-
pensive spectacles, humor of such familiar
flavor that the laugh comes almost before
the action, and over all must hang the atmo-
sphere of syncopated harmony, the opium or
thought. “Tangerine ” “Kid Boots, A
Night Out,” “Wildflower, The btieet
Singer,” and perhaps a dozen others were ot
this desirable mixture and rewarded their
introducers with long and successful runs.
The stars who brightened them were ot that
charming sort who stimulate rather than re-
tard the gastric juice in its difficult task ot
disposing of a constant procession ot ng-
centres and vanilla-creams.
Nevertheless only optimists like Hugh d.
Ward and the Messrs. Tait would be likely
to contend that these confectionery triumphs
confirm the hypothesis of Brunetifere. Pos-
sibly the Gallic theorist has begged the ques-
tion. Mankind has been continuously at
holts ever since the Cro-Magnon man tried
conclusions with Homo Neanderthaliensis, so
that any temporary uplifting of the public
taste can always find a war date handy.
Or else we have asked too much of poor old
1925. who may still have been a little shell-
shocked.
M.G.S.
Blank Verse Mismeasurement
In suggesting that blank verse lias only
four feet, I am assuming that the basis of
“feet” is accent or stress, which, I take it,
is the accepted formula. Also, before seek-
ing to justify the “four-feet” contention, it
might be well to state that the expression
“blank verse” is used here for convenience,
and is intended to include any rhymed verse
of the same measure, such as heroic couplets,
sonnets, and stanzas like Gray’s “Elegy.”
All of these, for the present purpose, will be
referred to as blank verse, because they are
in that measure, the rhyme being but an
extraneous embellishment.
The blank-verse metre, prosodically known
as the iambic pentameter, is generally de-
clared to consist of five feet, each in turn
consisting of an unaccented and an accented
syllable in that order. This formula, within
certain limits, is, of course, subject to varia-
tions which do not at present concern us.
Gray’s “Elegy,” in its opening line, illus-
trates this succession of weak-strong syllables
repeated five times
The cui'i|few tolls) | the knellll of part||ing day||
That is probably as perfect a sample of the
iambic pentameter as the language contains,
and it certainly falls into the five-foot meas-
ure without difficulty. But what about a line,
just as unquestionably in the blank-verse
metre, such as :
Deep|| in the shad||y sad||ness of a vale||
Neither in reading nor speaking this does
any accent fall naturally on “of,” nor
any other syllable, apart from tbe four
stresses indicated. Instead, the very basis
of the melody in this beautiful line is the
double gliding movement —one might almost
say the double sigh—achieved first by the
run of weak syllables from “Deep'’ to
“shad||y,” and, secondly, by the still longer
run of similar syllables from “sad” to “vale,”
leaving only four stresses and making it im-
possible to apply the five-foot measure except
by the artificial accentuation of “of,” which
would destroy the subtle music of the verse.
A few other lines chosen at random, also
from Keats, further illustrate the four-
stress value: —
A thing|| of beau||ty is a joyll forev||er.
Si||lent upon a peak|| in Da||rien||
Even a line much more weighty in syllables,
such as
Those green)|-robed senj|ators of iniglit||y woods||
contains only four natural stresses.
This four-stress value is not a feature of
Keats alone. Milton, who aimed for more
jionderous effects, more majestic movements
of verse, presents the same problem:—
I sung|| of Cha||os and eter||nal Night||
A world) | devote)| to u||niversal wraek||
It must be admitted, however, that Milton
contains a large proportion of lines that can
be measured on a five-foot basis without un-
duly warping the natural stresses, lie is
exceptional in this. Shakspeare, whether
in tragedy or comedy, runs definitely to the
four-stress line :
Full man|]y a glo|)ricus morn||ing have I seen||
And pall|| thee in the dun||nest smoke|| of hellll
But here j | upon this bank|| and shoal || of time||
The deep|| damna||tion of his ta||king off))
Examples could be multiplied endlessly of
such definitely four-stress lines. In addition
there are many borderline verses, those to
which five stresses can be credited without
straining the accentuation, yet which, when
read aloud, would sound unduly ponderous
were they given full value for those five
stresses and which move more musically, with
more subtle variations, with fascinating
pauses and runs, if read to only four main
stresses. One random example:—
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May.
This could be read with utter monotony, as:
Rough winds|| do shake|| the dar||ling buds|| of May|]
But obviously the first accent falls on
“rough,” since it is the “rough” winds which
are the offenders, as distinct from “gentle
or any other sort of winds. The accent
thus falling on the first syllable breaks the
monotony somewhat and develops a pleasing
glide movement to “shake.” It might be
optional to allot to “dar[|ling” an equal
stress with “buds,” but by giving the less
important adjective distinctly less value
than the highly important noun another glide
is achieved leading on to “buds.” Thus the
line, instead of being five monotonous hob-
nailed hoof-beats, becomes a singing double
glide, rounded off with a definite stress
falling naturally on what in this case chances
to be the rhyme-word, as thus: —
Roughll winds do shake|| the darling buds|| of May||
It is the introduction of these gliding
movements that in a great degree makes the
difference between stodgy, or at least heavy,
verse and musical verse, and it is by their
manipulation that many of the most import-
ant effects are achieved. A vivid example
of the speed, for one tiling, that can thus
be given to this verse-form, which on a
strict five-foot basis would admit of no speed,
is contained in Francis Thompson’s
I fled 11 Him down|| the arch||es of the years. || ,
It fairly leaps from “arches” to “years.
That, however, is more or less by the way.
The main point regarding such borderline
verse as “Rough winds do shake,” etc., is
that the glides to which it lends itself, and
which so melodise it, can be achieved only
by giving it but four stresses. To accentuate
the point, take a passage full of subtle
pauses and runs, a passage that swings and
sings, dances and glides, a thing of delight-
ful rhythmic effects :
These] | are the foij|geries of jea||lousy ;||
And nev||er since the mid||dle sum||mer’s spring! |
Metll we on hill,|! in dale,|| for||est, or mead,||
Bv pav||ed fount||ain, or by rush||y brook,||
Orj| in the beac-h!led marg|ient of the sea,[|
To dance|| our ring(|lets to the whistl||ing wind,||
Butl | with thy brawls|| thou hast disturb! ]ed our
sport. 11
The only line there with any definite claim
to five stresses is the third, and it is argu-
able whether even this would have a five-
stress value in the same way, say, as that
rare and funereal line: —
The curl (few tolls] | the knell]] of part| ling day||
Even so, this funereal line, if read with
a slight easing-up of accent on the adjectival
and slightly redundant word “parting,” could
come within a four-stress analysis without
any undue straining to achieve such an end.
This is important to the point I wish to
suggest: that all English verse known as
iambic pentameter, including even those
lines which seem most true to this metre,
runs naturally and musically to a four-stress
measure, while, with but few exceptions, it
is only by an unnatural straining of accent
that it can be fitted to the five-stress formula.
Admittedly the basis of English verse-
music is elusive. But, while it is possible
to argue on what is the constituent of a
blank verse line, there is no bewilderment
as to whether any particular line is blank
verse measure or not. It either is or is not,
unmistakably. The form is cast-iron in its
recognisability, yet elastic in its variations
to such an extent that a line may have
from ten to twelve syllables, with four or
five natural stresses, apart from other in-
ternal differences of structure.
Yet our only recognised law governing it
is the clumsily-devised formula of “feet”
based on accents. Some other method must
be discovered before we will be able to
make a satisfying analysis of verse forms.
And we are not likely to discover such other
method until we topple the existing tradition
and realise that our present formula is
hopelessly defective and crude. It must be
so while it tries to pretend that such a de-
finitely blank verse line as
Deepil in the sbad|]y sad||ness of a vale||
contains live accents.
BARTLETT ADAMSON.
And Again—What is Art?
Rupert Bunny was not picked out as a
typical Bolshevist in art, as “M.G.S.” sup-
poses (R.P. 17/12/’25). He was cited be-
cause he recently exhibited in Sydney a col-
lection of New Movement art which hit
lovers of his legitimate art a smashing blow
on the intellectual solar plexis. And his
offence seems uncalled for, unpardonable.
When a man who has won honorable mention
at the highest courts of appeal in London
and Paris deliberately scraps the gods who
brought him fame and dings away liis repu-
tation, you naturally feel angry with him
and sorry for him. Angry because he has
let you down. Sorry because he lias let him-
self down.
As to what is art and what not: we need
go no further than Rupert Bunny’s own
work to find our answer. The work which
established his reputation for thoroughness
and sanity in art, upon which rests his claim
to immortality, is art. His ISiew Movement
art is not. It is a distressing example of
what may befall a brilliant artist who allows
his reason to be clouded by the specious argu-
ments of irreverent compatriots.
The question is, Have New Movement
artists anything to say, any new message for
mankind? The answer is overwhelmingly in
the negative. Atmosphere is vital to art;
yet New Movement artists deliberately dis-
regard it. Some artists —and critics, too,
for that matter —claim that there is no atmo-
sphere to Australian landscape, or, at least,
very little. Surely they interpret atmosphere
as meaning moisture, mist. But the dry
summer haze of Australia is atmosphere;
very much so. You cannot paint heat with-
out expressing it in terms of vibrating atmo-
sphere. A blob of red and yellow paint does
not express heat. You must have vibration.
And there are no edges in Nature as New
Movement artists would have us believe; no
hard outlines to make objects stand out the
better. And there is no distortion. Every-
thing in nature takes its place with wonder-
ful rhythm. You never see anything out of
tone in nature, anything inharmonious.
Except, perhaps, some theatrical sunset
effects which are a trifle overdone —one of
nature’s indiscretions. But, from Epstein
down, New Movement artists deliberately dis-
tort nature to the point of absurdity. More,
far more, than New Movement artists have
helped ns to is needed to convince us that
they are not on the wrong track. Their
study of nature is barren of romance. And
their faulty observation is inexcusable. With
scant scientific knowledge, apparently none
of anatomy, possibly less of perspective,
working solely from observation, the sculp-
ture and architecture of early Greek artists
is the most perfect in style and proportion
of any known art. With all our cunning,
our culture, our accumulated knowledge, the
intellectual and aesthetic achievements of
these artists have never been excelled.
And what is true of Greek art in com-
parison with modern art is also true of mod-
ern art in comparison with New Movement
art. It must be a broad, simple, sincere
representation of nature, must express the
mood of nature, the effect; must convey the
emotion of the artist, not be exaggerated
caricatures of nature. But New Movement
art is exaggerated caricature ; seems in a way
of becoming a mere recrudesence of pre-
Raphaelism. New Movement art is coarse
in craftsmanship, fosters the cult of the
vulgar, encourages deliberate aceentuation
of ugliness. It possesses neither faith nor
permanency. The cold, hard facts of nature
should not be shouted. Such may more
profitably be left to the camera. There
should be a boldness, certainly, but an ele-
gance, a refinement of execution. But
according to these New Movement artists
you must paint nature solely in terms of
its outward visibility, not in terms of its
inward suggestiveness.
But let us get away from the model the
least little bit and give the imagination a
chance not produce pictures which are
obviously the model on the dais and nothing
more. Consider how Norman Lindsay uses
his models. No slavish copy of the model
there. The trend of New Movement art is
towards cold, hard facts. But even the cold,
hard facts are not faithfully represented.
They are distorted into cold uglinesses.
New Movement art does not raise the
standards of art. It drags them down. It
is content to rest upon lower levels, to ex-
press trifles in a commonplace manner. It
is not the gift of the gods. It is not an
emanation of divine fire, not the outpourings
of the human soul. It is the crude product
of the human brain. Hard, matter-of-fact,
commonplace. Pride of craftsmanship goes
for nothing with New Movement artists.
The best traditions of art are whittled away
by the idiosyncrasies of human invention.
Trifling in conception, slovenly in execution,
New Movement art is a very definite step
in the direction of decadence. It lacks the
primary essentials of art —tone, atmosphere,
harmony, spontaneity, imagination, emotion
and inspiration. Anyone conversant with
the best traditions of the art of the eighteenth
and the nineteenth centuries the period
which gave us Gainsborough, Reynolds. Rom-
ney, Whistler and, in landscape, Turner,
Constable, Corot —and thus touched the
highest point in modern art —realises how
far New Movement art falls short of the
truth.
“M.G.S.” reminds us that Rupert Bunny
has painted some very lovely pictures. Ex-
actly. That is why we are angry with him
for painting some very ugly ones. Would
“M.G.S.” have Rupert Bunny repaint his
legitimate art in terms of New Movement
art? For that is the test. To go farther,
would he, if it were possible, have Whistler
re-draw “Battersea Bridge” in this post-
modern style? Or Bolshevise “Carlyles
Mother”? And would lie suggest that »tree-
ton repaint “Transparent Noon” in this
manner, and Lambert his inimitable helt-
portrait” ? I venture the opinion that he
would denounce any such suggestion as blas-
phemous. . ~
So the vital question, then, is: Does New
Movement art raise the standard ot art.
And if it does not, then there is no excuse
for it.

A Satchel of Books
Comes the Blind Fury, by Raymond Escholier
(John Lane). A translation by J. Lewis May from
the French. The story gives the reader an intimate
view of the bourgeois home and its code of ethics
and religious life —all quite unlike the sins and
satins of the conventional Paris.
The Adventure of a Younger Son, by Edward John
Trelawny. One of the neat volumes in the pocket
edition of the world’s classics issued by the Oxford
Press. A friend of Shelley, there could scarcely be
a stronger contrast than that of this “half-Arab
Englishman,” as Mary Shelley described him, set
against the gentle-natured poet. As an example of
his extravagant, surcharged style, this reprint serves
a purpose, though for modern readers much of its
original interest has departed.
Electrical Power and National Progress, by Hugh
Quigley (Allen and Unwin). In a foreword to this
comprehensive review of the economic and industrial
development of the applied power of electricity,
D. H. Dunlop expresses the conviction that “elec-
tricity is one of the fundamentals which will modify
in the near future our whole industrial complex,
and with it have a profound effect on civilisation
itself.” “We are,” the author himself says, “coming
closer and closer to a form of energy which can
be entirely used—energy which, in the shape of water
power, is eternally renewed —and, although the
immense power inherent in the atom may never be
caught, we are actually now in sight of power possi-
bilities beyond the conceptions of even a few decades
ago.” The book presents to the reader a general
view of the progress in the use of electric power
and its probable effect on the future.
The Everlasting Man, by G. K. Chesterton (Hodder
and Stoughton). Mr. Chesterton, who is as valiant
as his literary style is robustious, undertakes the
task of viewing the Christian church from outside,
sitting, as it were, on some remote planet, thus getting
his subject in perspective and putting the record
into characteristic quips and quiddities. He wants
to see the whole in a dry light from which every
stain of partiality has been filtered out. His book
.is divided into two parts, one a sketch of the main
adventure of the human race in so far as it
remained heathen, the second a summary of the
real difference that was made by its becoming
Christian. Having coveied the whole subject with
an ingeniously woven garment of paradoxes and
other literary’ tricks out of the weaver’s box, Mr.
Chesterton finds it necessary to add an explanatory
chapter. He calls it “a sort of summary,” but it
is merely a re-affirmation of the Christian attitude from
the earliest days of Christianity. In the midst of the
body of religious thought from primitive days to the
present century, right in the middle of it “stands up
an enormous exception. It is quite unlike anything
else. It is a thing final like the trump of doom,
though it is also a piece of good news; or news
that seems too good to be true. It is nothing less
than the loud assertion that this mysterious maker
of the world has visited his world in person It is
the one great, startling statement that man has made
since he spoke his first articulate word, instead of
barking like a dog.” That is what the Christian
church has been declaring for nineteen centuries, and
now, as we advance into the twentieth century since
the nativity of the Holy Child, comes Mr. Chesterton
to announce the news —at great length and in unique
style.

From Concrete to Worn Macadam.
Don’t accept it as inevitable that on reaching the end of the concrete road speed must be
reduced considerably because you are to run on to a stretch of macadam road for which the
strain of modern traffic has proved too great, and which is, in consequence, little more than a
series of small holes. You have thoroughly enjoyed the “spin” over the hard, smooth concrete
surface. The quiet, even running of the engine has been as music to your ears; the car has sped
along apparently without effort, and with neither rattle nor squeak. Objects to right and to
left of you have seemed to glide by; steadily and smoothly you have gone forward, enjoying
every moment of your existence till—bump!—bump!—and instantly you “come down to earth,”
and rough earth at that!
Shock Absorbers were made to do away with that wretched bumping and jolting of the
car body that is so distressing to the motorist, and that has such great possibilities of trouble for
the car itself. Such bumping and jolting will indeed be inevitable on bad roads unless and until
the action of the car springs is controlled, and the object of the use of shock absorbing devices
is to control spring action —to prevent the violent rebounds.
To “take” one shock and miss the next—and perhaps the next, also, if the shocks come
very quickly, as they must do on a badly-worn road—betokens a fault in the design or construction
of the shock-absorbing device. Such a charge cannot be laid against the Stewart Shock Absorber.
Its ability to take shocks is such as to compel admiration. The wheels of the car may be
travelling over a veritable stream of holes and ruts, and the springs, as a result, be function-
ing continuously, but with Stewart Shock Absorbers controlling their action all that you, in the
car, are conscious of is a not unpleasant rolling motion. The two features of this improved shock-
absorbing device that appeal most strongly to experienced drivers are this “taking” of every single
shock and the trouble-proof construction.

Guerdon.
Mauve splashed against the restless green
Of willow frond and laurel bough;
And, sprinkled on the grass between,
Soft bells that breathe of what has beeu —
The jacaranda’s blooming now!
My steps are on the sordid ways,
Where jealous piles shut out the sun,
And groping spectres end their days
Imprisoned by the walls of haze,
Nor guess their lives had not begun.
Pale spectres of the present these
Who shackles find in memory
And guerdon in the pul.seless ease
That moves no beat for all God’s trees
Or bells of color melody.
My heart is heavy with it all—
The ghostly dance, the hollow tread;
Death’s fingers scratching at the wall
Of withered things that fall and fall
And take no mem’ries to the dead.
Hot cheek to cheek, hand to moist hand,
Brave wailing of a saxophone,
Drugged eyes, and hearts that understand
No music hut the clanging planned
To dull for each the other’s moan !
Grim laughter echoes down the room,
Choking the tinsel majesty—
Up, up on polished floors of Doom
And dance to the all-conquering tomb,
Fine paupers of no memory!
Mauve splashed against the swaying green
Of willow frond and laurel bough ;
And, sprinkled on the grass between,
The tiny bells of What-has-been —
The jacaranda’s blooming now!
Dance on, swift days, that twirl and fleet!
The jacaranda bells are shed
That I, above the clutching street,
Immune where Man tempts God to cheat,
May bear some guerdon to the dead.

The Garden.
The old grey ivied walls enclose
A scented wilderness where rose
And pink tecoma intertwine.
The gold laburnum bunches droop
Above the mossy paths and stoop
To kiss the starry jessamine.
Between the hawthorns, under snow
Of bee-filled blossom, to and fro
The sisters walk with quiet eyes.
The moments pass unheeded ; days
And years have seen these flow’ry ways
Unchanged beneath the changing skies.
Long, long ago, when they were young,
They loved; and little songs were sung,
Dreams dreamed beneath the lilac-tree.
One lover died ; one rode away;
One never spoke. And so to-day
They live together, sisters three.
They do not speak of loves long dead.
They watch the birds build overhead
And talk of scents and buds and trees;
Their pensive eyes are tranquil, yet
So wistful. How can they forget
The garden’s haunting memories?

Elfland.
Tall trees I see forming dark frames for the
water,
And glimpses of blue through a dark piny
screen ;
And beyond, on the gold sands, a fairy king s
daughter,
A white water-baby, a laughing young
queen.
I step from the road under branches down-
bending.
Ah, this is the pathway to Elfland in truth :
If I follow and follow the path may be
trending
To places men knew in the world’s tender
youth.
tn the shining sweet water, a slight fairy
shallop
Is sailing, is skimming with white wings
outspread;
The horsemen from Elfland, they gallop, they
gallop—
Hark! Now they are coming and now
they are sped!
High over the water a dark hill is looming,
A place where an ogre, for sure, has his
home ;
And, borne on far breezes, the sound of
waves booming
That crash on the beaches where mer-
maidens roam.
“O foolish one, foolish one,” someone is
saying,
“How can you believe you have found
Fairyland ?
’Tis but the sea-breeze in the tall pine-tree
playing,
And that is a laly down there on the
sand!
“ ’Tis no fairy shallop, that sailing-boat
yonder;
But this is the harbor and that is the
sea”
“Begone,” said I, “doubter! In strange
ways I wander;
Whatever you say, this is Elfland to me!”

THE BRUCE-PAGES IN A
CONSTRUCTIVE MOOD.
Tke Federal Government recently got on to
two constructive jobs in one day, and if it
bad got on to them with both feet the pace
would have been better. But the old diffi-
culty remains, and the Prime Minister badly
needs to sell bis wings and buy a spiked tail
with the money. Many bad things have been
said of the Devil, mostly on poor authority,
but even his worst enemies have generally
credited him with industry and energy. The
Ministry began its headlong career by pro-
posing to extend the Port Angusta-Oodna-
datta railway another 297 miles to Alice
Springs, making 77.1 miles of construction
at the south end of the great transcontinen-
tal route, and that is the end which fur-
nishes the only visible prospect of Northern
Territory settlement. The idea of beguiling
settlers by sea to Darwin, which is 3010
miles of water from Melbourne, and where
industry has been killed by Bolshevik influ-
ences, and then sending them a few miles in-
land by a railway which ends nowhere, is
quite devoid of promise. The proposed ex-
tension, which will leave off at a dead-end,
but not so dead as the present end, is to be
uuib. cheaply, for the cost is “not to exceed
x . 1,700,000,“ or £5124 per mile. This is
cheeseparing when compared with the pro-
posed expenditure to furnish a duplicate
Sydney-Brisbane connection. Yet the South-
to-North track is a dire and absolute neces-
sity, and not a semi-luxury, like other Fed-
eral lines located between places which were
previously, and still are, furnished with ship-
ping.services. The cheapness is to be arrived
at by adhering to the unsatisfactory and
poverty-stricken 3ft. Bin. measurement, and
cutting out the standard gauge in the Fed-
eral Government’s own province—the only
province worth the name that it possesses.
Yet that uniform gauge is said to be a
sacred principle for which Bruce and Page
would almost perish at the stake, despite
the prevailing scarcity of firewood. It would
be only a mildly heroic measure to put the
"hole transcontinental route on a 4ft. Sin.
basis, and then Westralia and Queensland,
vhich naturally hope to join up their sys-
tems, might also acquire a leaning towards
uniformity. It is suggested that the 297
new miles may be completed in 3| years, bar
strikes. It is no breathless pace, especially
as there are 15 years of complete loafing to
make good. Canada built some 2500 miles of
its first transcontinental railway (it pos-
sesses three, with a fourth in progress) in
not much over four years..-
* * * *
It being evidently the Government's day
for big problems of commerce and communi-
cations, it was natural that the case of Tas-
mania should crop up. That State depends
wholly on the sea as an outlet and inlet for
everything that is large and heavy, and the
sea works according to the Navigation Act.
and the Act works badly at all times, and
worse when Walsh and Joiianson are in
a more unpleasant mood than usual. The
Act shuts out from the inter-State trade all
the casual vessels which used to do odd jobs,
over short or long distances, for an island
State. They can’t get a licence to butt in un-
less they engage extra-large crews at extra-
large wages, and possibly reconstruct the
innards of the vessel, and it isn’t possible to
do that for the sake of casual employment.
In fact, the inter-State trade is reserved for
vessels which are inter-State and nothing
else, and which, having an inter-State mono-
poly, can charge high coastal rates to cover
high coastal expenses. Tasmania has in so
many cases to pay high inter-State rates to
a mainland port, and the cost of transhipment
there, and then the regular oversea freight
in addition, that it is at much the same dis-
advantage as Darwin, though it hasn’t made
the same utter collapse as that Communist-
ridden port. It asks for permanent freedom
from the Navigation Act, and points out that
the exemption of an isle which makes up far
less than 1 per cent, of the Commonwealth's
area would do no perceptible damage to the
principle of the navigation law, however
much damage it might do to the tempers of
unproductive professional work-stoppers.
The Federal Government has got so far as
suggesting a small way to make better pro-
vision for the island’s tourist traffic in the
summer season; but as for the conveyance
of heavy wares without the present disas-
trous disabilities, the Ministry has apparently
no idea at all—not even the familiar one of
a subsidy. The trouble looks permanent if
the Navigation Act is permanent and if Tas-
mania is permanently an island, but the
Bruce-Page Government is short of a per-
manent remedy.
Yet simultaneously with these happenings
it had a burst of real enthusiasm. For a
long time there has been in the air a scheme
whereby the British Government is to lend
the Commonwealth as much as £34,000,000,
with low interest for a term of years, pro-
vided Australia takes a specified quantity of
J. Bull’s surplus population off his hands
as settlers. The Commonwealth proposes
to sub-lend this money to such States as may
apply, to the total neglect of its own big
State, the Northern Territory, and to put its
name, which is the name of all the States,
on the back of the bill. The Commonwealth
is to trust to the borrowing States for re-
payment, though it is difficult to remember
that any of them have ever repaid anything
yet. It is to be nominally consulted about
the works in which the sub-loaned money
will be invested, but after it has initialled
the list they may be done well or badly or
horribly as chance may dictate. It was on
the Ministry’s constructive day that Prime
Minister Brltce broke glad tidings on this
subject to the House of Representatives.
Westralia had offered to borrow £10.812,358.
Westralia has only Bj per cent, of the Com-
monwealth’s population, and it has far the
biggest debt per head. Yet it is willing to bor-
row 31 per cent, of the proposed huge loan,
and dab the same into “railways, highways,
water-supply schemes in country districts, to
develop land settlement, and generally to
increase the State’s migrant-absorbing power."
S. M. Bruce appeared to regard this as
splendid news. He mentioned with less en-
thusiasm that Victoria and S. Australia
were coming along in a small way, and he
added, with no enthusiasm at all, that the
other three States had so far not joined in
this new gold rush. This craving to pour
money into jobs that are not his concern is
in strange contrast to the niggardly sugges-
tion of £1,700,000 for the one responsibility
that really belongs to him. If money is in-
vested in the Territory Bruce can make sure
that it is well invested. It is set out in his
own calculations that the loss on the Port
Augusta-Alice Springs railway, when it gets
to work, will be £18,178 per annum, which
isn’t much for an unfinished dead-end affair,
and is a better spec, than the States are
likely to provide. Over the 297 miles of
route freight is now Is. 2d. per ton per mile,
and in the country further out it is more.
The reduction of this to, say, 2d. per ton,
which the railway should effect, is a more
promising ambition than anything that is
likely to bo achieved by lending money on
poor security to dribble through the hands of
State Premiers. But the Bruce-Page Gov-
ernment loves to fossick in the old dig-
gings, and even in its rare constructive
moods it hates to go pioneering more than
a mile from home.
THE END OF ENGLAND?
British Prime Minister Baldwin is fairly
3 cung (that is to say, he is SS, which isn’t
old for a man who has climbed so high),
and ho is generally regarded as a hopeful
sort of person. But he had a fit of profound
melancholy on a recent occasion, when
lie addressed the British Classical Associa-
tion on the possible finish or! the Empire, and
drew dreary analogies from the fizzle and
taL of Rome. In its later days, as he pointed
out, there were jiot suflfcient genuine Romany
left to carry on the business. When the old
institution let go there was no intellectual
successor left in Europe except the concern
ar Constantinople, which was as much Asia-
tic as European, and had also run short of
Romans, in addition to which its bodily
muscles had atrophied, though its literary
and artistic brain was the size of a globe.
Therefore Europe wandered into the Dark
Ages, and dwelt there in unlettered igno-
ranee, in unwashed and undrained supersti-
tion, amid serfdom and other disagreeable
circumstances, for 1000 years—loo9 years
according to a precise historian. Tile mel-
ancholy foreboding of Baldwin is that,
owing to the losses in the Great War, there
may not now be enough genuine Britons
left to carry on the John Bull industry as
it needs to be carried on, and so it may also
sink into decay.
* * * *
One reason why Britain is hardly likely
to go the way of old Rome is that
.Rome went a way that was all its own.
Under the much-advertised republic, Rome,
apart from its slave population, was blessed
with self-government of a sort, while the
provinces, such as they were then, lived
under the government of unpaid gentlemen
who brought a fortune home with them, and
took no advice from any local Cabinet. In
this respect the Roman, system differed from
that of Britain, and the proconsul wasn’t
exactly in the same street as the late
Walter Davidson. The republic had hardly
got to the point of admitting the free but
common herd to some political rights, and
had hardly built its first library, before it
began to have doubts about its capacity for
self-government, and about some other things.
These misgivings were justified. The last
century of the regime which ended when
Cato blew himself up was annoyed by about
a dozen civil wars, the siege of Rome by
rival factions, the habit that each leader
go't into, in moments of success, of execut-
ing, so far as possible, everybody who looked
as if he preferred the other fellow; also by-
slave revolts and badly-managed foreign
scraps. Rome, being left without enough
boil a fide Romans, except dead ones, to run
the business, naturally filled up with mixed
provincials, and as these were thinned out
it was recruited with extra-mixed provin-
cials. When emperors became available the
free community went out of the self-govern-
ing business gladly, having really been in
it not very long, and having lived in it most
untidily. The first discrepancies between the
end of Rome and the prospective end of
England are that the British Army hasn't
.mutinied, nor have the Houses of Parlia-
ment fled to Turkey with Bompey or any-
body else. And there are others, including
the fact that British progress isn’t hampered
by’ a long garment like a sheet.
* » * »
The British State was at least twice so
near the verge of dissolution, as far as ap-
pearances went, that any depressed politician
might have ordered its pine coffin as a matter
of course. When George 111, trying his
hand at personal government, had blundered
into a losing war with the American colonies,
and also with France, Spain and Holland, it
looked as if Britain might take a permanent
back seat through insolvency, low spirits and
loss of faith in its star. Save for William
Pitt, who was a marvellous rebuildcr, and
the French revolutionists, who made a plea-
ant diversion, it might have settled down to
the vegetable life. Earlier than that, in the
preliminary Stuart days, it was in danger
of premature failure through not learning
how to keep up with the procession. The
feudal system, which was compulsory service
on a large and well-organised scale, had
passed out, and nothing definite had arrived
to replace it, especially nothing fit for long-
distance enterprise. Elizabeth was served
by a capable sea force, but it mostly con-
sisted of patriotic pirates who made war sup-
port itself and pay a dividend, that being a
marvellous period when there were treasure-
ships to steal. But in the next reign Britain
found itself appointed one of the champions
of the Reformation, and cordially invited to
stand in line with Holland, Denmark and
Sweden. Then it appeared that Britain had
lost the punch of its progenitors, and that
land-war was a lost art. The effort to raise
an army for foreign service consisted mostly
in tile doubtfully legal seizure of persons,
always of bad character and often of low
mentality. There being no barracks in's which
to put soldiers, and the baronial castles no
longer serving as rallying-points, the new
troops were armed more or less and turned
loose under inadequate supervision to scratch
for themselves till due to embark for the
scene of glory. They reached the scene to
the extent that one rabble of 12,000 got
ashore in Holland, amid the shouts of the
Dutch, who didn’t want it at any price, and
mostly died there through mud-diseases. It
never faced an enemy. Another was attacked
in the rear by an inferior force of French
regulars and destroyed, practically without
resistance, while making a bolt for its ships.
The British Empire survived even interludes
like these, so there is evidently (or was evi-
dently) a good deal of vitality in the old
apparatus.
* * * #
If Britain is approaching the day of
eclipse, as Stanley Baldwin visions, there
is satisfaction in believing that it will die of
something new. Failure to collect bad debts
from Dominions and Allies may help on the
trouble. An insane sensitiveness about shut-
ting down good aud hard on the influx of
some other fellow’s motor-cars, picture films,
and 1000 other things which destroy local
employment is another outstanding danger.
Last year .T. Bull’s imports exceeded his
exports by 390 millions, and as his income
from foreign investments is only a shadow
of its old self he accumulated new embar-
rassments in the effort to pay. That wasn’t
Roman, but it was damfoolish. For lack of
the connecting link with the Dominions
which a High Protectionist country could
establish by tariff concessions there is really
no definite empire at all. The Navy, which
is a valuable link of a sort, is cut danger-
ously low in order to save money for Yankee
motor-cars and films, and in return Hoover,
the Yank, talks about an alleged British
rubber combine. Britain is also absurdly
short of militarism, which is a blessed thing
when taken in reason, and inspires respect,
and supplies healthy exercise. Too many of
the Empire’s rifles are carried by niggers.
The land is overcrowded with genuine
British folk: instead of there being insuffici-
ent to carry on the business there are enough
for a business-and-a-half. A good deal less
philanthropic frenzy about preserving the
unfit so that they may reproduce their species
might be mentioned here, especially as the
least desirable members of the community
have the largest families. Further, the
Empire might be less in danger if there was
less craze for teaching Discolored Brother
that he should have “representative institu-
tions.” Discolored Brother never supplied
himself with “representative institutions”
when he ran his own show, and he has no
more use for them than a shark has for
Christmas. Doles and drink and horse-
racing are institutions which give a mild
Roman flavor to Britain’s alleged decadence;
apart from these, it is difficult to find any
symptoms at all of the ills that killed the
ancient State beside the Tiber. So there are
really hopes that the collapse of Britain may
be postponed, even if the imperial capital
has to be moved to Canberra to give the
mass a more reliable balance.

Possibly Baldwin had eaten something
which disagreed with him. %,
AN AUSTRALIAN AVATAR.
I HAVE at least liad the honor of speaking to
Annie Besant’s avatar. It was in Sydney
at the Adyar Hall. He is a finely-drawn,
slight, beautifully-proportioned young In-
dian, with a golden skin, delicate extremities
and features more regular than the average
European’s. God Krishna, in the avatar
in which he dallies so gallantly with the
heavenly milkmaids, resembles him exactly.
He has a shy and undecided manner, and
we had little to say to one another. The
English schools in India turn out the same
type annually in thousands. Some of them
get poorly-paid positions on the railways or
in Government departments; others join the
ranks of the disaffected and make bombs to
throw at viceroys. It is a matter of luck.
Krisiinamurti’s good fortune it was to be
recognised' by that venerable mystic, Mrs.
Besant, as*a great new incarnation.
There is nothing new in the idea. Avatars
or embodiments of ancient deities or spirits
occur almost daily all over Asia. Any
mother has the chance of bringing into the
world the next Taoist pope, a Panclien lama
or a reincarnation of the innumerable gods
of Hinduism. Owning a human god is as
profitable to the Asiatic family as owning a
musical prodigy is to a family in Warsaw.
In Manchuria and Tibet the names of aspir-
ants are put into a bowl and a high priest
draws out the winning number. If the selec-
tion is for any reason inauspicious, the new
grand lama dies suddenly of infant diarrhoea
and a new drawing is made. In the case pf
Krishnamurti the selection was made as
long ago as 1909. Ever since there has been
a steady canvass in his favor against rival
candidatures in every country in the world.
Nowadays movements grow with very much
more rapidity than in the old days of oral
transport. The American organisation of
the cult is said to spend over four mil-
lion dollars annually in gramophone records
alone. A few months ago in Java I talked on
the fascinating subject with a native prince,
the elder brother of the Susuhunan, who is
prevented from reigning as the spiritual head
of 35 million Javanese by the circumstance
that he is the offspring of a secondary wife
of the previous potentate. The loss of this
chance of temporal power and the fading
with advancing years of practical participa-
tion in earthly pleasures had driven the
gloomy aristocrat into seeking refuge in the
new doctrine. He told me he was a member
of the world-wide organisation which is pre-
paring for the coming of a great World
Teacher. Those who believe in him will
live, the rest will perish. He interpreted his
membership as meaning that he alone out of
the 35 millions of his fellow-countrymen would
survive the catastrophe. He leaned across
the round table on his wide pendopo and
said this with an air of gentle satisfaction as
if he were prognosticating a change for the
better in the weather; and then he lolled
back and went on sipping his abominable
coffee. I looked apprehensively at the dark-
ening heavens wondering if his own god—he
is orthodoxly a Moslem —would not send
down a thunderbolt upon his calamitous old
head. Of course his harem would survive,
lie proceeded, beckoning some cringing slaves
to bring his guest more of that atrocious
coffee. Then lie told me the most surpris-
ing thing of all. He had insured that ho
should be amongst the millions who would
never die by reserving a seat in the amphi-
theatre that was being built on Balmoral
Beach, in Sydney.
That was the first I had heard of the remark-
able project initiated by the Australian mem-
bers of the sect; and as soon as I got an
opportunity I went to Balmoral to see the
completed edifice. It stands close to the
water in all the white glory of Dofie
columns, huge semi-circle of concrete benches
and wide platform marked with a star. On
the star the Great Teacher will stand to
deliver his message to his immediate audi-
ence, and, by means of radio, to the world at
large. Between the Doric columns the
great sliced north arm of Sydney Heads can
be seen, the foam bursting at its foot, and
beyond, on the ineffable blue of the Pacific,
vessels going to and fro about their business
as if no universal doom impended. The deep
slap, slap of the breakers on the beach below
sounded like the tapping of a titan’s baton
calling the orchestra to attention for the
mighty prelude. No more majestic stage
could have been set for such a happening.
A tall girl in a loose gown and felt slippers
and in her gaunt face blue eyes more piercing
than any black ones showed me over the


theatre with an air of suppressed excitement
Many of the seats, she pointed out, had
already been engaged, and little brass tablets
had been let into them to indicate their
owners. The price for a single seat m per-
petuity ranged from £lO to £lOO. according
to position, and amongst the subscribers
were individuals or communities that had
sent their cash from Sweden, (lima. Cali-
fornia, Denmark, all the big cities of Maori-
iand and many Australian country districts.
An element of pathos was given to that in-
visible assemblage of patient watchers by
inscriptions hero «ind there stating that the
owners had died or even been killed “some-
where in France.” They are astral mem-
bers, my cicerone explained; the booking-
office for the greatest show the world will
ever see accepts the nomination of people
who are dead to the flesh but whose ghostly
hands on the night of nights will clap to-
gether with the living.
The name of my Javanese prince was not
to be found, but in the front row I found
the name of Kbisiinamurti. This is in-
teresting. It illustrates a phenomenon of
the religious mind for which the psycholo-
gists have a special name. Previously a
humble spectator in the pit, he is now pre-
paring to take his place as the principal
performer.
M. G. S.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Can the Council Commit Suicide?
‘‘Does power to amend necessarily infer
power to abolish?” This is the kernel of
the most important issue raised in the N. S.
Wales Leg. Council on the bill before that
House with the object of its extinction. Gov-
ernments in all self-governing States are
strictly limited within the four corners of
their written Constitutions. In England the
Constitution has been a matter of evolution
and is not a statutory enactment; in these
States, on the contrary, it is a written charter
of rights, conferring powers of and establishing
machinery for self-government. Beyond the
limits of its written Constitution the State
cannot go. That is the issue raised. The
section reads as follows: —
The Legislature may by any Act alter the laws
in force for the time being under this Act or
otherwise concerning the Legislative Council, and
may provide for the nomination or election of an-
other Legislative Council to consist of such members
to be appointed or elected by such persons and in
such manner as by any other Act is determined.
This section give the Legislature power to
“alter,” but contains no specific power to
abolish or destroy. In order to render
any Act of the Legislature valid within the
Constitution, it must be shown first of all
that it is a legitimate exercise of the power
of amendment. It may be argued that
amendment does not halt at any point down
the scale, and that in the downward
slide abolition may be reached, so that
in effect abolition may be the extreme of
amendment. Possibly that argument might
be sustainable. But the section goes on to
say “and may provide,” and it is on these
and the following words that much depends.
It is not permissible in interpreting a law
to rip out a few words from the context
and give an isolated meaning to them; they
must be read into and as part of the whole
text. If that text should present any am-
biguity in its phrasing, a Court must inter-
pret its meaning having regard to the gen-
eral intention of the Act. In this case the
layman could have li,ttle hesitation in arriv-
ing at a commonserise construction of the
section's meaning. It ( s implication seems
to be* beyond doubt.lt gives |a continu-
ous existence to the Second Chamber.
The local Legislature may amend it, alter
its form or change its personnel—in short,
provide for all sorts of desirable or undesir-
able things about it—-but it cannot wipe it
out without an amendment of the Constitu-
tion, for it is a constituent part of the Con-
stitution, and no State Legislature can over-
ride that. If the Constitution said that “the
Legislature may alter the laws in force con-
cerning trades unions,” what Avould the Labor
party say about a Legislature which, on the
strength of that authority, proceeded to
abolish trades unions ?j It would certainly
hold that such a Legislature was over-strain-
ing its powers and exceeding its authority.
And that contention would be strengthened
if, following the authority to “alter,” there
came the words “and may provide for trades
unions founded on different principles.” It
would certainly be contended that the right
to “alter” was given in order 1 that the Legis-
lature might provide for certain things in
connection with trades unions not at the
moment of the passing of the original Act
thought necessary or desirable. Whether the
Constitution ought to limit tiie powders of
the Legislature in this way is, of course,
another question. But obviously there are
advantages in limitation when it is possible
for a Government to nominate as a legislator
one who boldly advocates gerrymandering in
order that a Government may retain the
power which it has —in other words, in order
that it may defeat the will of the people and
establish the rule of a minority. It is pre-
cisely for the purpose of meeting such con-
tingencies that Constitutions are sat up.
A Return to Reason.
Federal Attorney-General Latham makes
a good start on his job. Instead of trying
to prop up Senator Pearce so as to enable
him to deport persons disliked by the Min-
istry, he seeks to amend the Crimes Act so
as to vest the powder of punishment of
serious industrial offences in judicial tribu-
nals obviously more competent than the
Senator and three other persons, called a
Board, to determine whether or not an of-
fence meriting very grievous penalties has
been committed. It. may possibly have
occurred to the Attorney-General, although
the point seems not to have been dealt
with by the High Court in Walsh’s ease,
that to deport a citizen is a judicial act
that can only be performed legally by a
judicial officer appointed in accordance with
the Constitution Act. This point has been
already raised and decided by the High Court.
In the Wheat Acquisition case the Inter-
State Commission, acting under the autliority
of a Federal Act. purported to exercise the
punitive powers therein conferred upon it;
but the Court had no difficulty in deciding
that there was nothing doing in this direc-
tion, and that, although the Commission
might inquire into everything on the con-
tinent, it could not punish anyone for any-
thing, because its members bad not the quali-
fications prescribed by the Constitution.
Magna Charta cannot bind any legislature in
the Empire. It stands as the pious hope of
those who desire freedom, but may expressly
or impliedly be legislated out of existence.
Similarly, the Act of Edward VI., which
put a permanent end to the Star Chamber
and provided that offences should be tried
in the King’s courts by the King’s Judges
and not by any other tribunal or person, is
binding only ,so far as it consists with local
enactments; but the Federal Parliament
cannot exceed the powers of the Constitu-
tion that created it. The endeavor to create
a local Mussolini out of the Senator and
his Board was in reality an attempt to ex-
clude judicial functions from the judicial
authority. If the endeavor had been made
by Jock Garden and Tom Walsh it would
be explicable; that it should have been per-
mitted by Robert Garran and Littleton
Groom seems to indicate that these four per-
sons are subject to the comparison and criti-
cism long ago made in the case of the
colonel’s lady and Judy O’Grady. A domi-
nant principle of the Constitution is the
reservation to Parliament, the Executive and
the Judiciary of the functions appropriate to
each. The tendency of much of the Federal
legislation has been to vest in the Executive
legislative and judicial functions. Every
step taken in this direction is an advance
towards the Soviet objective. The learning
of Latham, A.-G., # promises to counteract
the unwisdom of recent political policy and
Ministerial performance.

Financial Lis'hts and Shades.
The British loan horizon had just cleared a
little when new clouds began to gather. The
embargo on new loans was lifted, and the
prodigal sons arrived with a rush, shouting
for veal. Westralia got £2,500,000 and Tas-
mania £600,000 of new money. South Aus-
tralia got £1,800,000 and Queensland
£2,500,000—at least the money was found,
but, for the time anyhow, the underwriters
had to find most of it themselves, which sug-
gested that the market was getting used up
again. This was disappointing, for the
market hadn’t been expected to sag at the
knees again so early, like a giraffe with ring-
bone. The fact that some £5,000,000 of old
loans came along for renewal about the same
time wasn’t unexpected, but it wasn’t help-
ful. It was only another of the perpetual
reminders that if the loan isn’t lent again
and again indefinitely there is no visible
alternative save for the Australian borrower
to burst and the British lender to find him-
self in an orifice. There began to be uneasy
whispers that the N.S.W. loan pf £5,000,000
or £6,000,000 (regarded as an instalment of
an lOU for £11,250,000) might have to
wait a little till the atmosphere cleared.
N.S.W. is the Nark which stands outside the
Federal and State borrowing combine, and
while it has the Very biggest debt it has the
smallest sinking fund to give the debt an
appearance of solvency. In the midst ot
these untoward events grief was caused by
the fact that J. Bull subscribed two foreign
loans, including one for Sao Paulo (Brazil)
•—small loans carrying high and tempting
interest. Remarks were made about with-
holding the children’s bread and lending it
to dogs, though dogs are not particularly
addicted to bread, and the Australian child-
ren owe a most fearsome baker’s bill already.
The natural reply was that all the best dogs
pay their interest bills, or most of them, in
gold or in some saleable commodity wdneh
J. Bull requires, while he now has to lend
the Australian most of the new money with
which to pay interest on the old loan, and
to renew the old loan to boot. Some of the
London papers, scenting trouble, begin to urge
Australia to distribute its business more,
and to give the Yankee capitalists some of it.
But these gentlemen charge rather high, and
despite much large talk their actual lend-
ings have been small. Australian Federal
securities have been selling at a discount in
New York, which looks bad for future opera-
tions. On top of all, the United Stationer
doesn’t contemplate the renewal of loans in
the easy-going British fashion, but is dashed
particular about a sinking fund to meet the
debt at maturity. Then there is an influence
at work of which, in time, the money market
is bound to take notice —in fact, it probably
takes notice now, but tries to persuade itself
that it doesn’t see anything, the prospect
being too alarming. The Labor programme
howls blatantly for blank Communism, and
leaders who profess to scorn and abjure the
Red creed, and who swear that they never
saw T a Communist in all Australia and don t
know the animal by sight, accept the Red
programme as the price of their political
existence. The “objective” demands the
“socialisation” of the means of production,
distribution and exchange, which is the
annexation, by people who profess to be
trustees for the nation, of everything, after
the Russian style when that style was at
its worst. This includes the repudiation
and cancelling of the public debt. The
“capitalist” is to go, and an aggregate capi-
talist to whom there is a thousand millions
owing will naturally be an early goer. The
confiscation of petty bits of wealth in the
shape of coin and jewels can only be effected
by most laborious search, but the biggest
public debt in the world can be “nationalised
or “socialised” by one edict. Labor, as
represented by its Langs and McTiernans,
is shocked, and even outraged, at the idea
that its credit shouldn’t be considered good
enough for a practically unlimited additional
amount of the private capitalist’s money,
and Labor, as represented by the programme
on which these same men politically exist,
promises to abolish the capitalist and steal
all this money when it becomes supreme,
which, it claims, is an assured event. This
leading of the double life must bring about
complications in time probably not very
much time.

Mr. Lang’s “Semitic” Friend.
There are some queer uplifters of the
downtrodden masses in the new gold-pass
Labor party. One of them is Anthony
Alexander Alam, a Dubbo (N.S.W.)
storekeeper in a big way of business,
who was among the 25 Leg. Councillors
appointed on December 21, and who for help-
ing to vote the Council out of existence is
to retain the title of “Honorable,” the pri-
vileges of the Macquarie-street club and (if
the Labor party can manage it) a pass over
the Australian Government railways and
tramways till the end of his days. Shortly
after Anthony Alexander was sworn in
a Leg. Assemblyman demanded to know “if
it is not a fact that this gentleman is not
of British or Australian origin, and that
his father is not a naturalised subject.” Pre-
mier Lang brusquely replied that “Mr.
Alam is Australian-born, and everything we
know about him is of the very best.” The
appointment was also questioned by one
C. W. Hogan, described as a Dubbo book-
maker and a prominent member of the local
Labor League. Bogan’s professional pride
had apparently been hurt by the Premier’s
refusal to include another bookmaker among
the 25 M’s.L.C., although 27 members of the
Parliamentary Labor Caucus, which stands
resolutely for the workers receiving “the full
results of their industry,” had recommended
the representative of the Odds-layers’ Union;
at all events, the O’Rogan alleged that
“Alam’s appointment had been made behind
Labor’s back.” He explained these words by
saying that Anthony Alexander was the
nominee of no Labor League, and that the
genuine nominee, W. P. Kelly, had been
brushed aside to let Alam in, a proceeding
for which he blamed Dunn, the Minister for
Agriculture. Presently the Roganites go-:
hold of a letter in which Alam expressed
the hope that Tiicrby, Country-party
M.L.A. for Wammerawa, would be “returned
by a big majority,” saying to the latter:
“You have served the constituency well, and
if there is such a thing as gratitude among
the rural workers they must vote for you.”
He was also accused of remarking that
Syrians had too many brains to be manual
laborers, as so many Australians were, or
words to that effect. The upshot was a
motion for Alam’s expulsion at a crowded
meeting of the Dubbo Labor League. His
friends were present in force, and he de-
fended himself vigorously enough. On the
Thorby charge he argued that, since propor-
tional voting rendered it certain that two
Laborites and one non-Laborite would be
elected for Wammerawa, there was no harm
in supporting whom he pleased for the non-
Labor seat. As regards another count of
the indictment his defence was as follows
(Labor Daily report) :
Nationality was an accident of birth, but he was
not ashamed of his Semitic blood, which was the
purest in the w’orld, and he had no apologies to
make for being descended from the place chat gave
birth to Christ.
When it came to the vote the Roganites were
overwhelmed. At Alam’s instance, the
meeting expressed confidence in that gentle-
man and Dunn, “hearty condemnation” of
Rogan and “the utmost contempt” for
Thorby, who, of course, did not appear.
Flushed with victory, Anthony Alexander
rushed down to Sydney and voted for the
first reading of the bill to abolish the Leg.
Council. On that occasion he said (S. M.
Herald report) :
He was sorry to think that he was to be a party
to abolishing the Council, although such had to be
done. If there were to be gold passes he would hi
the first to hold out his hand for one. The initia-
tive, referendum, and recall were absurd and vere not
workable. He considered that abolition was pre-
mature, and he urged the Government to gerry-
mander the electorates throughout the length and
breadth of the State if they wanted to win the next
election. If there was a doubtful seat they should
do as was done in Victoria—open a new railway line,
put on 500 or 600 men, and get their man in.
It is embarrassing advice, especially as (1)
the Government proposes to have the elec-
toral boundaries fixed by unspecified members
of a public service which swarms with Labor
supporters, and (2) the enthusiast for gerry-
mandering is to be rewarded, at the tax-
payers’ cost, by being carried over the
Government railways and tramways until lie
shins up the golden stairs. Still, the Labor
party may console itself with the _ thought
that it is assured of the “Semitic” vote
descended from “the place that gave birth to
Christ.”

The Position of the Medical Trade.
Dear Bulletin,- —r or some time past the
British press the world over has been
conducting an attack on my particu-
lar trade union, the B.M.A. Whilst
in England last year I read many
articles on its narrow-mindedness, folly
and mental stagnation; and during the
last few weeks the Australian dailies have
carried on the good work. The Sydney
Telegraph favored us with its leading article
on the subject a few days ago. The question
of our alleged deficiencies resembles a good
many others, in that there are two sides to
it. The two main points on which we are
attacked at present are (1) our refusal to
have any truck with one Sir Herbert
Barker, a bone-setter, and the subsequent
smack in the eye the King gave us when he
honored that gentleman with a title; (2)
our alleged slowness in taking up new
“cures.” The latter grouch is particularly
in the foreground just now, when a Sydney
doctor -lias put forward a claim for still an-
other cure for tuberculosis. Look at the ques-
tion from a coarse, commercial point of
view. Doctoring is a strongly competitive
business. lie who delivers the goods makes
the money. People these days consume an
abnormal amount of journalistic food, so
that while most of them certainly suffer from
acute mental indigestion, a sufficient number
of them have the intelligence to pick out the
“live” practitioner when they see him. Surely,
then, any single member of the profession
who deliberately turns his back on a new
cure is running a grave risk of financial
suicide. It doesn’t pay him to turn down a
good thing. And, believe me, he doesn’t do
it. What the layman does not realise is this.
Certain diseases, like tuberculosis and cancer,
are what are known as “chronic diseases,”
as distinguished from the “acute disease,”
like measles or mumps. To say whether a
chronic disease is cured is about the most
difficult question a practitioner has to an-
swer. It takes years before one is in a
position to give a positive answer at all.
Lots of chronic diseases are immediately
benefited temporarily by some methods of
treatment, only to relapse again a short time
after. How many of your readers in their
lifetime have read startling newspaper an-
nouncements of "a new cure” for cancer.
T.B. and rheumatoid arthritis? I can re-
call live new cures for cancer alone in as
many years. And where are they now?
What has happened to the people who an-
nounced them? The first point in the argu-
ment, then, is that time —years, in fact —is
necessary before any new method of treat-
ment can be regarded as successful. The
next point is that there are certain recognised
ways of testing and accepting a cure. Doc-
tors are not infallible, and many a man lias
deluded himself into believing an untruth.
The wish is often father to his thought. It
is essential that the lucky man who hits on
a new thought in medicine should present it
with suitable evidence as to its truth before
his colleagues. They, in their turn, or a .
limited number of them, must test it out
before announcing their verdict. What is
unreasonable in that? When a thing is
satisfactorily tested and proven we are not
slow to accept it. Book at the immediate
acceptance of Banting’s insulin and our
own “Johnny” Hunter’s thesis on par-
alysis—the two most recent successes. It is
absolutely essential for the safety of the
public that any new cure be tested by several
men before it is used by all and sundry.
Take the classic example of the Grand Old
Man of Surgery who taught us the value of
asepsis in the operating theatre. He first of
all tried to put his theory into practice by
means of a carbolic spray. The result was
that a large number of his patients developed
acute carbolic poisoning, as a further result
of which many of them died. Now for the
other complaint—about our non-recognition
of the man who is unqualified according to
law. The principle is sound enough. The
State, in its wisdom, has ordained that be-
before bestowing its official blessing on the
man who wishes to pursue the healing art
he must satisfy the State’s examiners that
he is sufficiently qualified to do his job. Is
there anyone particularly desirous of having
that regulation altered? I think not. But,
then, up springs a gentleman who discovers
that he has a gift for bone-setting or some-
thing or other, and demands admittance to
the fold. He also demands that a member
of the fold should come and give his anaes-
thetics so that he can carry on the good
work. Are we very unreasonable in insisting
that the bone-setting individual should first
of all go through a complete medical train
ing and prove to the State in the usual way
that he is competent? The human body is
an extraordinarily intricate machine. Our
bones are worked by muscles that are fed
by arteries and nerves that lie, or begin, a
great distance away from their ultimate field
of action. A man who treats the part must
understand the whole; probably Sir Her-
bert Barker did : but why should he have
been allowed to demonstrate his knowledge
without undergoing the State’s protective
examination of efficiency? If he is entitled
to do it. why aren’t others? The point is
surely this: If the State deems it necessary
to safeguard her children by imposing a re-
striction on those who desire to be known
as her doctors, there logically should be no
exceptions to the rule. Is the B.M.A. very
far wrong in merely backing up the State’s
attitude in the matter? And as for Barker’s
amesthetist, if you admit the last argument
you must automatically concede that his ex-
pulsion was justifiable. His motives were
probably of the highest, but he offended
against what I have endeavored to show is
a just and reasonable law. and he was pun-
ished. —Tours, Claude Oesophagus.

Steel Trade Troubles.
In the 12 months ended June 30 Australia
purchased 403,114 tons of foreign iron and
steel, paying £7,477.040 for it. Every penny-
weight of that metal could have been pro-
duced in Australia and every penny of the
money kept in the country. The principal
reason why so many Australian orders w r ent
to foreign parts is contained in the follow-
ing little table, which shows the wages paid
to skilled and unskilled workers respectively
for 48 hours’ work in the engineering trade
in various countries :
Skilled. Unskilled.
Australia . . . . 106/0 03/-
England .. .. 60/2 44/2
Germany . . . . 43/- 23/5
France .. .. •• 38/5 27/6
Belgium . . . . 30/7 23/2
Australia pays half as much again to a
laborer who wheels castings about in a bar-
row as the Old Dart hands out to a full-
blown fitter, and in Belgium one can hire
three good journeymen fitters for the wage
of one Australian laborer. The Australian
iron and steel industry is practically self-
contained. With the exception of administra-
tive expenses, which bear probably a smaller
proportion to the total in Australia than in
older lands, the whole cost of production is
made up of labor costs. Iron ore and coal in
themselves cost nothing. It is the labor of
winning them that has to be paid for. It
follows, therefore, that the rate of wages
is the most important thing in the industry.
In the last year or so, while production costs
in England and Europe have been reduced
in various ways, Australian production costs
have been raised by the Arbitration Court,
which has added an average of ss. a week to
the wages bill. The State of N. S. Wales
has just engineered a further increase of
production costs amounting to about 12 per
cent, through a statutory reduction of hours.
Obviously one of two things must happen
if the Australian iron and steel industry is
to survive. Either production costs must
lie reduced to a competitive level or a few
more tiers must be added to the tariff wall
to dam out the tide of imports from other
countries. Application has accordingly been
made to the Tariff Board for an increase of
the existing tariff, which ranges from 20s.
to 48s. a ton, to imposts of from 30s. to 88s.
a ton. But neither a tariff nor anything else
known to human science can indefinitely se-
cure to any nation the right to consume more
than it produces, nor can any device make
such a thing possible. This is why Australia
with its colossal burden of debt cannot afford
to monkey with economically dishonest
schemes for reducing production while in-
creasing wages. Still less can it afford to
tolerate political leaders whose idea of a re-
generated world is a world that refuses to
work.

One Clean Sweep Wanted.
A quaint example of the service provided
to gratify one of Australia’s favorite vices
is the Loco Shilling Sweep, which, like most
of these affairs, has had its agents in the
larger shops, warehouses and factories in
and around Sydney. The prizes and condi-
tions of the “draw” were set out in the
tickets like this :—-
1st —£100. Decided by last figure first foul
engines arriving Platform 11 at or after 3 p.m. on
Jan. S, 1926.
2nd —£30. Decided similarly on No. 2 Platform.
3rd —£10. Decided similarly on No. 6 Platform.
Cash Prizes —20 at £l, 20 at 10/'-, 80 at 5/-.
According to the conditions, tickets to have
had any value must bear four numbers;
that gives a margin of 9000 tickets, worth,
at a shilling each, £450. The prizes offered
total £l9O, so, even if there was any guaran-
tee that there is no juggling with them, the
conductors of the stveep own a potential
gold-mine; yet the public rushes such sweeps.
Like the S.P. man (regarded even by wives
as a benefit, because, while he can put his
few shillings on. away from the course, a
husband will not lose a day's pay to go to
the races), these sweeps get their immunity
from prosecution because of public sanction,
and their support because of the popular
inclination to relieve the tedium of life by
the chance of “a rise” that a gamble affords.
The hypocrisy of the law and those who
administer the law makes it far from amaz-
ing that the people should regard as perfectly
harmless the daily violation of the law by
themselves. The hypocrisy starts with the
Federal Government, which, having declared
Tasmania's big sweep-promoting industry
illegal, has made provision for the little State’s
financial necessities by authorising it to col-
lect the tax on sweep prizes which its own
taxation authority used to gather. Also,
whilst assuming a desire to stop the delivery
of letters to the concern, it has introduced
a postal note of a denomination specially
needed by the concern’s clients for remit-
tances ; and in its post offices, as agent for its
Commonwealth Savings Bank, it cheerfully
accepts Tattersall’s prize-cheques. In view
of that attitude adopted by the Common-
wealth, it is not surprising that the State
police should adopt a similar policy of
toleration; action is only taken under pres-
sure of complaints from wives whose hus-
bands have spent too much of their money
in illegal betting, or gamblers who have
been cheated —or think they have been
cheated. In Queensland an attempt has
lately been made to stamp out the
illegal forms of gambling, and there
the action is, of course, taken to pro-
tect the State-controlled gamble. But
in any case the private-enterprise sweep,
with all its opportunities for obtaining
swindling profits from the subscribers, has
very little chance in the northern State
itself against the gamble, open to the people,
in which fairness is guaranteed, although
Queensland lottery-promoters have reaped
a harvest in other States. The Queens-
land Golden Casket lottery in five years
collected £897,878 from its subscribers,
and the interest on its funds has made an
additional £20,993; in the same period
£679,398 of the money was passed over to
hospitals. Even the people who regard the
State sanction of lotteries as objectionable
must admit that the toleration of largely
fraudulent lotteries under a hypocritical pre-
tence of discountenance is still more objec-
tionable, and that it would be better for
the large sums indicated by the Queensland
figures to go to useful public purposes than
into the pockets of distinctly undesirable
loafers. If the gambling mania can’t be
suppressed, it is far better for it to be
regulated, and for the sufferers from the
fever to be given a fair run for their money.
Anything at all would be better than the
present orgy of insincerity.
♦
The Reds’ Finance.
Having supplied sufficient backing to Walsh
in his hooligan defiance of the laws to give an
appearance of endorsement to the hooliganism,
the official union bodies in the various States
feel themselves under an obligation to pay
Walsh’s £lOO fine for inciting a strike, and
the costs involved in the case and following
appeals. The fine is still unpaid, and flic
union enthusiasm is so slack that frantic
appeals for the money are being made by
the Melbourne Trades Hall Council. Mean-
time it is suggested that the Commonwealth
should be tender-hearted enough to delay the
enforcement of a fine already long overdue.
It is a humiliating attitude to adopt towards
an authority upon which the now humble
petitioners have tried to heap all kinds of
insult and hurt. In the days before the
Seamen’s Union gave itself into the hands
of the Reds it could have paid the few hun-
dreds involved with an easy smile and without
any appeal to other unionists. To-day, how-
ever, the financial position of the Seamen’s
Union is a tangle of debts, mysterious leak-
ages of funds, and balance-sheets which
auditors have refused to sign ; and, if the
Commonwealth Registrar liked to be harsh,
additional penalties might be piled upon the
other troubles of the organisation as a result
of repeated failures to obey the requirements
of the law in respect of the filing of balance-
sheets. The muddle should be an object-lesson
to unionists on the awful capacity of the Reds
to produce financial chaos; if in the simple
affairs of a union organisation they are able
to produce such a frantic muddle, their accom-
plishment, if they were entrusted with the
handling of a State’s or a nation’s finances,
is something that can hardly be conceived.
\Y ALSir and Co. have added no practical
benefits for the seamen to those secured for
them in the days when Arthur Cooper
was general secretary and Senator Guthrie,
now dead, the president of their organisation.
These leaders were not Reds, but they fought
well for the men they represented without
forcing upon them strikes which reduced
their families to want. If an actual neces-
sity arose for extra funds to meet emergencies
a levy upon the members of the organisation,
without appeal to other unionists, was cheer-
fully paid by seamen who, owing to regular
employment, were prosperous; and a reserve
fund of £20,000 Avas built up to form the
nucleus of a co-operative undertaking Avhich
would have given many benefits to the sea-
men. That £20,000, a splendid start for the
extravagance of Walsh and Co., has van-
ished in the Avliirlwind of a foolish direct-
action policy. It is now said that there is a
deficit of £1272, the shortage having been
helped by a reported robbery in the Victorian
branch, although, in the tangled condition
of the union’s affairs, nobody is able to
throw any light upon hoAv, Avlien or by Avhom
the robbery Avas committed or exactly hoAv
much is involved. Still the affairs, without
any robbery. Avere in a bad enough condition
12 months before, when the balance-sheet
showed a credit of 25., although the auditors,
Avhose bill lately remained unpaid, refused to
certify even to that. It AA r as whilst matters
were in this condition that the leaders helped
to promote, and guaranteed financial support
for, the British seamen’s strike, with results
which sent the starved Britons away with a
CRIPPLED.
“Trades are finding the 44-hour week difficult in operation.”
THE KANG: “A ow, how on earth do you expect me to hop?"
feeling that they had been “sold a pup.” The
debts of that Red enterprise are still hanging
around the necks of the union branches. The
cost to the Melbourne branch alone was
18130; and, as the money that came in was
only 17480, and the branch has no funds of
its own, its officials have to listen to the
piteous pleas of keepers of cheap boarding-
houses and restaurants for a settlement of
their bills. The whole position should open
the eyes of unionists generally to the capa-
city of the Reds to produce a financial
nightmare, even when given an opportunity
in only a small way.
One J. G. Mitciiie, member of a big Scot-
tish fish enterprise, is shortly to visit Aus-
tralia and “inquire into every phase of the
fishing industry in the Commonwealth.” The
Melbourne journal which publishes that in-
formation casually mentions that among the
cargo carried by the s.s. Ulysses, just arrived
from South Africa, was 350 tons of frozen
fish, a record to date for this trade. The
practical Scots trawler-owner should have
plenty of subjects for inquiry when he gets
here. He will find a people which, though
living mostly around the edge of seas teem-
ing with magnificent food fish, finds it neces-
sary to import hundreds of tons of inferior
fish from a country thousands of miles away.
And he will discover that a small alien group
has acquired a stranglehold on fish-distribu-
tion, and has, in addition, beaten off every
attack by State or Private Enterprise on its
monopoly. If, when he has seized and
puzzled out these things, and a lot of others
more or less connected with them, he returns
to Scotland with a better opinion than ever
of our energy, enterprise and capacity to do
things for ourselves, he will be a most un
usual Scot.
“M.G.S.” : Dr. Robertson, A r ictoria’s health
chief, has just released the figures of public
hygiene for the departed year. He seems
better pleased Avith them than circumstances
warrant. In 1890, he says, the death-rate
for Victoria was 16.10 and in 1924 it w T as
10.05. The average expectation of life has
increased from 47 for males and 49 for
females in 1890 to 55 and 58 in 1910. Per-
sonalljq I find no great comfort in these
statistics. People used to live to a green
and contented old age before the era of
jazz, petrol transport, card indexes and other
speeding-up devices. Some of them survive
into hoary eld to-day, but the amount of
available contentment seems to have dimin-
ished. Most of the old people I know grizzle
about their rheumatism, and are fretful about
draughts; furthermore, they are distressed
daily by the spectacle of the corruption of
the times. A veteran of 60 who is alive to-
day, if he had enjoyed the expectation
allotted to men. in 1890, would have missed
the (treat. War. the development of broad-
casting, the invasion of jazz, the rise of
Hollywood, the unpleasant consequences of
11.C.L, and the necessity of paying for Can-
berra. He would never have heard of Bol-
shevism, Walsh and Johanson or the new
gas that can wipe out a large city in five
minutes. Incidentally, I note that the first
census in the history of Persia has disclosed
a woman aged 146 who has a son aged 117.
Unless Persia has entirely escaped the influ-
ences of modern civilisation the lady is to
be commiserated.
Some of the minor perils incurred by those
who go down to the sea in ships were men-
tioned in a Melbourne case against four
Indians charged as prohibited immigrants.
They said that they deserted because, being
unwilling to pay the serang the “cut” he
claimed from their wages, they were afraid
that he would fulfil his threats about throw-
ing them overboard. The captain admitted
cheerfully that the serang considered he had
a prescriptive right to levy such tolls, and
added that he had known of Indians mys-
teriously going overboard. Possibly such
drastic methods of dealing with the recal-
eitrant are not confined to the heathen in
his blindness ; there were some white stew-
ards during the recent seamen’s strike who,
while declining to take any active part in
the hold-up, excused themselves from con-
tinuing at work on the ground that they
entertained objections to being buried at sea
before they were fully-qualified corpses. It
looks as though there might profitably be
more earnest inquiry into cases where men
mysteriously disappear during a sea-voyage.

“Ibn El Issar” : Soudan cotton, grown in
the great Gezireh triangle between the junc-
tion of the White Nile and the Blue, pro-
mises to give Britain as definite a control of
the cotton market as that which she main-
tains in rubber. The last annual report of
the Soudan Plantations Syndicate, which
has already 100,000 acres under crop, makes
this clear enough. The Gezireh contains
2,000,000 acres, 300,000 of which have
already been canalised and are being
cultivated by some 10,000 tenant farmers
who are paid a fixed price for cotton deliv-
ered to the mills. Cheap native labor is
plentiful, the modern Port Soudan is con-
nected by rail with the Gezireh, and the
gigantic scheme is well on its way to flood
the cotton market. Just where Australian-
grown cotton, with its comparatively high
production cost, will stand in regard to the
irrigated, black-labor product of the Soudan
when the two compete in open market, it
is difficult to forecast; but the future so
far as export trade is concerned doesn’t look
good. The obvious remedy is for Australian
growers to secure their home market for
themselves. There is already a minor degree
of protection against imported cotton, and,
given a reasonable local cost of production,
Australia may yet manufacture her own vast
requirements in cotton goods from raw
material grown within her own boundaries,
no matter what the Soudan may do.
If there is anybody left in this fair land
who believes the high standard of white
workers can be maintained under conditions
of free competition with Asiatic labor, the
plight of the Federated Furniture-makers
of Australia should put him on the highway
to revelation. This white union has never
worried the Arbitration Court before, for
the good reason that it could not afford to.
Taking its courage in both hands, however,
it has just served Victorian, South Aus. and
Tasmanian employers with a log. It asks for
a minimum wage of £8 10s. for a week of
44 hours, the week to be concertinaed into
54 days and overtime to be paid at double
rates for the first hour and treble rates there-
after ; it asks that casual hands be paid
20 per cent, above the minimum. There is
only one nigger in the woodpile, and he is
a Chinaman. He is, in fact, several China-
men. The Celestial suffers from an inborn
capacity for doing faithful joinery, and there
are few races which can excel him in the art.
He made chairs and tables skilfully at a time
when the European white man was sitting on
fallen logs, eating his dinner off his lap.
The Chinaman avlio came to Australia in
search of gold took as naturally to making
furniture as he did to growing cabbages
on rocks. It was not long before he created
by his labors a class of Chinese capitalist
who was able to exploit his labor on much
the same basis as in his native land, where
children of 12 regularly work in factories
from six in the morning till 10 at night for
seven days a week and a monthly wage of
70s. or less. In Australia factory inspectors
prevent the too-fearsome aspects of the
Oriental’s genius for making slums, but all
the legislation in the statute books cannot
alter Ah Thin’s ability to work from dawn
to dark or later and for living contentedly
on the aroma of yesterday’s curry nati. The
union of Australian natives dimly recognises
this fact and includes in its demands a clause
providing that th(e presence of a Celestial in
a Chinese establishment before 7.30 in the
morning or after 5 at night shall be an
offence like buying a drink after 6 p.m. But
this is no more likely to eliminate the in-
dustrious An Queue from the washstand-
making industry than similar efforts to drive
him from cultivating garlic. The most likely
consequence, if the log is ratified, will be an
increase of unemployment in the union that
is seeking to improve its conditions.
‘‘Ming” : The methods of the immigration
authorities are perplexing. Three years ago
four young English migrants arrived in N. S.
Wales, leaving; their parents behind them,
intending to send for the old people as soon
as they were table to support them in their
new home. The boys have worked hard and
consistently, dud have lately bought a small
house near Syd ney as the new family home. A
few months a/go, when they were anticipating
that the old /folk would be here for Christ-
mas, they ware informed by the authorities
that the father, somewhere in the ’sixties,
had been blocked as an immigrant on the
ground of heart trouble. It is a strange
attitude for a department which has in the
past admitted mental inefficients and degen-
erates of tl#e Puddifoot type, especially as
there is not the slightest fear of the parents
becoming a charge on the State, and heart
trouble is 'hardly a disease that can harm
anyone bu/t its possessor.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The difference between the N.S.W. Labor
platform and the N.S.W. Labor Government,
is briefly this. The Labor programme pro-
vides for the abolition of the Upper House
and the substitution of the initiative, referen-
dum and recall. The Government provides
for the abolition of the Upper House and the
substitution of free life railway passes and
other privileges.
Treasurer Page got on his feet the other
day to arrange for a grant of £450,000 to
Westralia, and to give assurance that further
alms would be considered. The big State
has an ear-splitting complaint about its
special losses through Federation, whereby
a deficit has piled up. During the last 10
years for which figures are available Tas-
mania collected £2B 7s. 7d. per head from its
population in an honest effort to pay its
way. The six States collected £25 7s. 9d.
per head. Westralia, persistently running
stiff, only taxed its people £2l 9s. lid. But
because it is big and talks of secession, it
usually gets what it asks for, no matter
how bogus its story may be.
“Mr. Lang was in joyful mood when he
saw the press representatives last evening,”
said the S. M. llekald of January 18. When
the end of the week came, the gentleman was
no longer joyful or cocksure. Three Labor
Leg. Councillors, commanded by caucus to
dishonor pairs, given before the Abolition
Bill was thought of, flatly refused, one re-
marking tartly that to “sneak-
thief methods.” A fourth Labor appointee
voted against abolition; a fifth disappeared,
and, although fmiziedly pursued by “com-
rades” and detectives, remained away until
an adjournment motion had been carried;
then he bobbed up with the announcement
that he had gone fishing, that Lang was not
going to bully him, and that the country was
fed up with the hectoring Premier, anyway.
Worsted at every point, the fatlieaded Gov-
ernment threatens to summon another ses-
sion “in two or three weeks” to pass the
Abolition, Gold Pass Bribe and First-past-
the-post Bills. But its prestige has slumped
heavily, and there is a noticeable eagerness
to wager that N. S. Wales will have another
Premier before it has a single Chamber.
Many Labor politicians are absurdly sen-
sitive about the prevalence of Bolshevism in
their midst, and one of them broke into the
Senate proceedings with the silly statement
that “a Communist cannot be a member of
the Labor party.” There is a rule to the
effect that a man can’t be in the Labor move-
ment and at the same time be a member
of a Communist organisation; but a million
Communists can be in the Labor party if
they keep out of the little crowd of self-
advertisers at the Communist Hall. Also,
they can shout Communism, preach Commu-
nism, teach Communism, “white-ant” trades
unions with Communism, and sell Commu-
nist literature on Sunday with the cordial
approval of a Labor Ministry. It is even
possible for an avowed Communist to be
director of a Labor paper, though his fellow-
directors may profess not to see him, or to
mistake him for someone else.
Weary of the indifferent leadership of
Farmer John Allan, head of the Vic. Com-
posite Ministry, some of his Liberal “fol-
lowers” are again talking about a change.
Seeing that Bruce is acceptable as leader
of the Commonwealth Compo. team, they do
not see why Lawson or Peacock should not
be in command of the State Coalition. Alto-
gether there are 37 non-Labor members in
Vic. Assembly. Of these only 13, including
the Speaker (Bowser), constitute the Farm-
ers’ Union group; the other 24 com-
prise 18 Libs., 5 Independent Libs, and 1
Independent. Now that the Nat.-Feds. have
been reorganised under ex-P'remier Lawson
(president) and Mac Lean (sec.), they are
prodding Libs, to assert themselves a bit
more.
Stop-work meetings are the order of the
day in the Queensland railways. The lament-
able Gillies Government conceded the “right”
to hold such meetings “in exceptional cir-
cumstances,” and the railwaymen interpret
“exceptional” to suit themselves. A stop-
work meeting was held at Ipswich because
a shunter was promoted (he wasn’t the
union’s nominee) ; and work was stopped at
NOTH TNG SERIOUS.
“The usual rumors as to the likelihood ot a split in the Bruce-Page Government by disgruntled
members of the Farmers’ Union are being circulated.”
They may have their tiffs, hut you can't heat a baby for keeping a home together.
Maryborough while the men discussed
whether a tinsmith could do coppersmith’s
work. A truculent deputation called upon
McCormack and demanded to know what he
meant by supporting the Commissioner in
the Ipswich case, and the usual back-down
followed. Hardly had the deputation left,
breathing threats, than it was announced
that an inquiry would be held into the pro-
motion of the shunter. Naturally, the board
of inquiry has now been declared “black.”
The N.S.W. Lang Government dislikes
proportional representation, or says it does,
but it positively loathes the idea of letting
the electors express their opinion of it at
a by-election until the P. 11. Parliament has
run its course. So when J. A. Perkins,
Nationalist M.L.A. for Goulburn, resigned
to contest the Federal vacancy in Eden-
Monaro, H. J. Bate, who was beaten at the
general election on May 31, was nominated
in his place. There are now three defeated
candidates among the 90 Assemblymen; the
• others are Minahan (Sydney) and Bagnall
(St. George). Perkins himself entered the
1920-22 Parliament as a nominee member.
He has made a good impression on fellow-
members and constituents alike (he topped
the Goulburn poll), and should hold Eden-
Monaro comfortably enough, although he is
not likely to lick Labor-candidate Morgan
by the 2-to-l majority that dead Austin
Chapman secured.
Tasmania has at last persuaded the Bruce
Government that it is up against unusual
difficulties. The Navigation Act has cut
off much of the old shipping facilities, and
the work-stoppers of the Seamen’s Union
cut off the rest at intervals with complete
impunity, and put up the cost of those which
remain. Being persuaded, Bruce had a
burst of energy and drafted this-
When it is shown to the satisfaction of the
Governor-General that the tourist traffic between any
ports in the Commonwealth or in the territories
is being injured or retarded, and the Governor-
General is satisfied that it is desirable that un-
licensed ships be allowed to engage in the trade, he
may, bv notice published in the Gazette, grant
permission to unlicensed British ships of such size
and speed as are specified in the notice to engage
in the carriage of passengers between these ports,
subject to such conditions (if any) and for such
period as are set out in the notice.
As a way of getting the lifeboat out it
seems slow but gentlemanly. By the time
(1) “it is shown to the satisfaction of the
G.-G.,” and (2) “the G.-G. is satisfied,” and
(3) the British vessels are found, measured
and tested for speed, and the conditions are
decided on and the Gazette printed, many
things may happen. xVnd then it isn’t even
specified that the passenger may take his
luggage with him. As for the islander’s
cargo, it may still rot.
Maoriland’s High Commissioner Allen is
nearing the end of his five-year term and
is likely to be replaced by C. J. Parr, who
became Minister of Education about the
time Allen went over to the Big Smoke.
Parr has already shed one of his portfolios,
which strengthens the impression. If Allen
re-enters politics his party won’t have to
search far for a Finance Minister. It was
Allen’s devastating assault on Ward’s admin-
istration that paved the way for the Liberal
overthrow in 1912, and he was in charge of
the Treasury from that date till 1920, except
in three war years when Ward was a mem-
ber of the Coalition Ministry. The sketchy
nature of Coates’s recent Cabinet reconstruc-
tion suggests that he is waiting for some-
thing to happen—possibly Allen.
Queensland Laborites are thinking seri-
ously of the possibilities of wireless. With
a Labor Government in power, the State
radio station can be used for broadcasting
Labor propaganda; but the Labor Govern-
ment is not likely to remain in power much
longer, and the unions are looking to the
future. There is a low-power broadcasting
station on the roof of Brisbane Trades Hall,
but not much use has been made of it. The
A.W.U. headquarters are fitted with wireless
receivers; so are all A.W.U. district offices.
The executive is now considering the former
secretary’s proposal to establish a broad-
casting station in Brisbane, and to instal
wireless receivers on the motor-cars used
by touring organisers, so that broadcast
messages may be picked up anywhere, at
any time. There are several radio enthusi-
asts on the executive, so it is very likely
that the scheme will be pushed through.
There is so much talk these days about
Red propaganda in State schools that the
Vic. Teachers’ Union has judged the time
ripe to nut the peg in. So it has stated in
a loud, clear voice at its annual conference
that ‘‘there is not nor ever has been” any
desire to affiliate with the Trades Hall or
any political party, and that it is wise to
keep “entirely free” from party political
associations. Moreover, the motion was
tabled by Black, the president, who was the
unsuccessful Labor candidate for Indi at last
Federal elections.
Grateful to him for sweeping away the
old heart-breaking and hope-killing method
of promotion and substituting for it an equit-
able system, Vic. State teachers gave Alec
Peacock a thoroughly friendly welcome -when
he opened the union’s annual conference.
For the current half-year the promotions will
mean an extra £40,000, and then the increase
will keep on growing till a quarter of a
million is added to the education vote. Labor-
leader Prendergast, who was also at the con-
ference, would swell expenditure still further
by providing a free university. For once
in a way he finds himself in haiunony with
Irvine, C.J., who also champions the aboli-
tion of fees, although when he was Premier
in 1903 he proposed a charge for senior State-
school pupils when they had passed a certain
standard.
The closure of Mort’s Dock (Sydney) was
ostensibly because of the refusal of the
paintei’s and dockers to obey the Federal
award, but the 44-hour week and the pros-
pective loss of one-twelfth of the output
probably made the management more ready
to take a rest from its troubles. The Dock
paid its shareholders only 5 per cent, on the
48-hour basis, and the new outlook wasn't
cheerful. Lang, of course, laughs scorn-
fully at the suggestion that a reduction in
working hours means a reduction of output
and therefore an increase of cost; all the
same, his own State quarries were no sooner
faced with the reduced hours than they
bumped up the price of road metal to muni-
cipalities.
A hint from a N.S.W. tramway man:—
It is eight years since a tram strike occurred in
N.S.W., and on that occasion many unions whose
members were not Government employees kept the
trammies company. To rely on arbitration has
always been the policy of our union; but when the
Commissioners employ lawyers permanently to twist
awards their way it makes such reliance difficult.
Several times the Commissioners have been summoned
for breaches of our award, but that never gets news-
paper publicity.
Among the wild-cat resolutions to be sub-
mitted to the Queensland Labor Convention
next month is one from the Toombul A.L.P.
recommending that Labor candidates’ names
shall be printed in red on election ballot-
papers, “Tory” candidates’ in blue, and In-
dependents’ in black. But that will leave
the job only half-done. Some ought to have
a fringe of green, and a few should be
streaked with orange. And there are bound
to be suggestions that in one or two (or 20)
cases the letters should be laid on their
side and printed in ci'imson.
“Huffin-Guffin”: Under the Federal law
for compulsory voting, what proof has a
voter that he or she has voted? A relative
of mine has just been invited to explain
why she did not vote on Nov. 14. She has
replied that she tlid. But she admits not
having taken the precaution to see that her
name was ruled out on the roll. I don't know
if any further action will be taken, but
evidently it is advisable to get some sort of
receipt for your vote.
Queensland Labor politicians are eagerly
discussing their chances of getting into gilt-
edged jobs while the going is good. P. W.
Shannon, a member of .the Land Court, is
leaving for Europe on long leave before re-
tiring. The other members of the Coxxrt
(Hardacre and Coyne) are ex-Labor Min-
isters. There is some talk of raising their
salaries from £lOOO to £2OOO a year to bring
them up to the level of the Labor members
(Gillies and Dunstan) of the Board of
Trade. If this is done, Premier McCor-
mack may think the job worth accepting.
Justice O’Sullivan, president of the Land
Appeal Court, will retire from the Bench
on December 13. No doubt he will take
long leave before then, so that an acting-
successor may be appointed before the State
election. There is not a lawyer in tin'
Parliamentary Labor party; but no man
with a £2OOO-a-year job to give away was
ever without a friend.
STRAIGHT TALK.

“He was sorry to be a party to the abolition of
the Legislative Council, which he regarded as pre-
mature, but it had to be done If there were to
be gold passes he would be the first to hold out his
hand for one.” — A. A. Alain, one of the 25 N.SAV.
Council executioners.
I’m not one of those birds who in vehement words
Protest, with venality branded.
What the others may gammon 1 don't care a damn.
You call me a hireling. I know that 1 am.
So at least you’ll admit that I’m candid.
I make no pretence of being swayed by a sense
Of honest conviction or duty;
This is work —freely granted—from which I recoil,
But I don't mean to jib at my whack of the spoil
And the cut I expect from the booty.
The Council must pass, alack and alas !
And it hurts me to help in the killing.
I’d readily spare it, God knows, if I could,
Like the parent who wallops a kid for his good
Remarking he’s sorely unwilling.
When we’re through with the job you can bet that
the mob
For the wage that’s our due will be clamant,
Quick and lively they’ll want it. ’Tis little to ask
In cases like these that the dirtiest task
Should carry the speediest payment.
My comrades may strike any poses they like,
But I am indulging in none.
When chosen 1 frankly admit that I knew
Exactly what I was expected to do
And I know what I’ll get when it’s done.
The Council must go, though it fills me with woe,
The stronghold so long of the classes,
And whoever may into the background retire
Shamefaced when our gang are receiving their hire,
I’ll be first in the rush for the passes.

In that big increase of figures the influence
of the deal with the New York Life is
visible. But the National notched new re-
cords apart from that. Only Ordinary busi-
ness is handled by this office, and its pro-
gress without Industrial makes one wonder
what its figures would be to-day had it been
helped by that valuable feeder. Hitherto
1920 had been the star year with 10,893
policies assuring £6,496,606. Last year’s
new business was still more : 15,596 policies
assuring £7,051,894 —-over three-quarters of
a million better than 1924. And even those
figures don’t fully indicate the National
Mutual’s vigor in recent years—a vigor ac-
companied by such admirable discretion
that expansion of business has been coupled
with a steady contraction of the expense
fate. This comparison shows what has been
done in the latter respect:—
Expenses Compared with Total Income.
1905.. £lB 2 9 p.c. 1921.. £lO 8 9 p.c.
1910.. 15 0 3 „ 1922.. 916 2 „

1918.. 1013 1 „ 1924.. 9 6 1 „
1920.. 11 14 6 ~ 1925.. 7 15 2 „
Certainly too much might easily be made of
the past year's figures, which don’t mean all
they seem to ; for £645,097 was received in
a lump for re-insuring the Australasian lia-
bilities of the New York Life. But after
allowing for that transaction the expense
rate of the National Mutual is now small
enough to take its place with Australia’s
very best. And except for a few offices
which don’t vigorously sweep the highways
for new business there is none better in
England.
Total income was assisted to its record
dimensions by a large increase in single
premiums—payments made for policies by
one amount instead of by annual premium
in the usual way. The increase amounted
to about £83,000. That expansion is the
outcome of an extra-good season combined
with the new fashion for probate policies;
a very good fashion, too, provided the appli-
cant is not an exceptionally vigorous and
healthy old person ; in that case it becomes
a question whether he hadn’t better back
himself to live a few years more than the
office’s expectation. A still further indica-
tion that the office is losing none of its
keenness lies in the information that group-
insurance was given attention, several con-
tracts being put through. One ill-starred
concern was launched in the recent boom
to deal specially with this type of insur-
ance, and several other young cos. have
stressed its possibilities in their share-selling
campaigns. But group-insurance is more
likely to fall to the established concerns
than to young shows fighting desperately
for business with portion of their capital
represented by hot air. Despite competi-
tion, increased new business was written, and
that at a rate only slightly higher than for
1924:

The shrinkage from the pre-war expense
rate means that so much more of the pre-
miums are available for return by way of
bonuses.
Further help in this important matter is
givdn by investment earnings. Here is a
comparison back to 1914:
Gross Interest Rates Net Interest
and Rents. and Taxes. Return.
1914 .. £418,326 £13,624 £404,702
1918 . . 597,218 34,330 562,888
1919 . . 653,939 27,160 626,779

1924 .. 1,123,086 51,091 1,071,995
1925 . . 1,247,274 51,498 1,195,776
Taxation has eased a trifle ; it took £4 2s. p.e.
of the gross compared with £4 11s. the pre-
vious year. Looked at another way the
earnings have moved as follows :■ —
Interest Earned on Average Funds.
1900.. £4 13 2 p.e. | 1922.. £5 8 4 p.e.
1910.. 4 12 3 „ | 1923.. 5 11 6 „
1915.. 4 17 2 „ I 1924.. 5 9 4 „
1920. .5 3 8,, | 1925. . 5 11 3 „
Such a movement should have taken place, of
course, in view of the fact that £5 10s.,
whether received as interest or anything
else, isn’t worth more than £4 was a few
years ago; but the improvement is better
than it looks in this table, on account of the
change in the nature of the assets, which
will be turned to presently. Apart from the
1923 return, which was swollen by a profit
made on the redemption of a parcel of Gov-
ernment stock, last year's figures were the
best recorded. Some of the explanation lies
in the exchange of old investments for secu-
rities with more cream to them: 6 p.e., 5£
p.e. and 51 p.e. were freely available during
the term for gilt-edged stock. Last year
£3,001,000 was received back and that, with
the net increase in funds of £2,242,090, made
a total of £5,243,090 available for investment.
The net movements in assets showed an addi-
tional £964,445 in public securities. Loans on
mortgage increased by £536,871, but the
substantial expansion in funds merely made
that half-million a proportionate growth.
Loans on policies were more than a half-
million heavier; and that tendency, visible
in other societies, isn’t one to win a cheer.
During the year £50,000 of Fourth Victoria
Building Society shares were taken up (this
is one of the National’s profitable invest-
ments) and the premises item grew by
£82,094. The latter represented expenditure
on new premises at Durban (S’Africa) and
at Geelong; both are nearing completion.
The disposition of the additional funds sug-
gests that the ratio of earnings to average-
funds for the present year will be main-
tained. The valuation of policies is now in
progress (g.-m. E. J. Stock'is also actuary),
and although the figures will not be avail-
able until next month the office states that
the bonus will be higher than previously,
after still further strengthening the reserves.
As the National Mutual’s basis of calcula-
tions is that the earning capacity of funds
will be 34 p.e., whereas last year’s rate was
2 p.e. greater, policy-holders can look for-
ward hopefully for further fat favors
in bonuses. Sooner or later, however, the
question is bound to arise whether insurance
premium rates generally should not be re-
viewed.
Last year the rate of mortality was only
55 p.e. of expectations; and there is another
fine source of bonuses in that. Incidentally,
for the first time in the history of the office
the amount paid under endowment assur-
ances matured exceeded the amount of the
death claims, an illustration of how whoie-
of-life has of recent years been displaced
by the endowment policy. It is not a change
to grow enthusiastic over: for the healthy
young man the whole-life policy is the one
under which he can get the greatest cover
for his young wife and family for the least
money. The amount of funds at September
30 was £22,607,250. Assets were in the
following form :
1910. 1914. 1920. 1924. 1925.
pc. p.e. p.e. p.e. p.e.
Public securities .. 5.1 6.9 39.9 42.7 43.2

Improvement in quality has been a marked
feature over the past decade, but, despite the
more solid nature of assets, there is an in-
vestment fluctuation reserve of £lOO,OO0 —
quite a comfortable reserve to provide for
contingencies.

If that was the true ptofit for the year
it wasn’t much of a return, all things con-
sidered ; for the 12 months to June 30 (the
show is mostly English, and headquarters
are in London) covered the rich period of
lofty wool prices and the widespread pros-
perity that flowed from other industries and
borrowings. The co. has lashins of cheap
money, t00—£1,700,000 of 4 p.c. debentures
and £1,000,000 of 5 p.c. prefs.- —from which
a bigger harvest might reasonably have been
expected in such a period. In its earlier
years the co. held big runs in Australia and
Maoriland, but it unloaded when it got
groggily to its feet after the droughts and
disasters of the ’nineties, and for many
years its own squatting interests have been
unimportant. Earnings come chiefly from
commissions, agency and general mercantile
business (control of Gollins, of Adelaide and
other capitals, was acquired in 1923) and
investments. Here is a comparison of bal-
ance-sheet items:—
1922. 1924. 1925.
Liabilities other than
debentures. . . . £690,688 £608,601 £961,236
Advances .. .. 3,000,361 3,136,080 3,618,340

Shares in other cos.. . 36,873 219,353 206,638
Liquid assets .. 1,487,740 1,029,925 918,492
The more important changes for the past
year were doubtless due to the necessity of
financing clients whose wool was held over
as a result of the postponement of sales.
Despite the abnormal increase in liabilities,
however, floating debt was almost covered
by cash and public securities alone. The
fact that the debenture debt is fixed means
that the co.’s clients can rest content; the
co. could afford to nurse its customers over a
bad time, and it is in a good position to
command credit —another feature of value.
So far as shareholders are concerned, the re-
turn is poor. No doubt the co.’s very bitter
experiences excuse a conservative treatment
of assets; yet probably there isn’t much
stowing away of undeclared profits. Cer-
tainly a process of hiding can’t be continued
for long without some signs of it showing,
and the “Wild Cat” can’t find any of them.

This is how the directors explained it in the
1024 report
The high cost of wool, other raw materials and
importations, coupled with financial stringency....
Large stocks of manufactured goods held.
And this is the latest: —
Large stocks of blankets and flannels were accumu-
lated at comparatively high manufacturing cost, in
the hope of some trade improvement. Anticipations
were not realised, and eventually sales had to be
made more in accordance with the present cost
of raw materials.
Yet this co. had advantages. It had made a
sound and promising start before William
the Goat butted the world into the mess from
which it has not yet emerged. And in the
war years it was one of the cos. which
reaped a golden harvest. In 10 years capi-
tal was more than trebled, the process con-
tinuing through the post-war boom, and even
through the temporary slump which followed :
by 1923 it was £150,000—£20,646 of it in
5 p.c. prefs. In the rich years when un-
settled war and post-war conditions granted
Australasian textile cos. an artificial Protec-
tion, the co. was encouraged to distribute
with a rather lavish hand. Not that it
neglected reserves; on the contrary. Atten-
tion was also given to depreciation and re-
newals. But unfortunately it saw the glow
of the golden conditions reflected too far
into the future.
Balance-sheet figures show that during the
year the co. at any rate reduced its high-
priced stock valiantly:—

Eaw materials and stores are in “at cost,”
and partly manufactured and completed
goods “at cost and valuation.” But whether
the warehouse has been emptied of all the
dear stocks is not made clear. The fact that
the directors report orders in hand sufficient
to keep the mill fully employed for six
months indicates, however, that the tide has
turned: the tariff increase has assisted tex-
tile manufacturers substantially. But more
may be necessary. It; is a standing disgrace
that Australia, chief wool-producer of the
world, should have imported in 192.5, accord-
ing to estimates, more woollens and worsteds
than in pre-war years; and it is by no means
certain that the new duties can wipe out that
reproach.

In its long life —it is one of the oldest
trustee cos. in Australia —the E.T.A. has
never issued bonus shares. In fact, even
new shares were placed at a premium until
last year, when shareholders got a bit of
fat for the first time. Subscribed capital
was in 200,000 £1 shares paid to ss. and
holders were given the option of taking at
par a new share for each share held. Need-
less to say the issue was greeted with en-
thusiasm. As the new issue shares in the
div. for the second half, profits had to bear
£9OOO, and, if the div. rate is undisturbed,
£12,000 will be called for next year. The
amount should be won, for with the new
money working only half the term £13,675
was disclosed last year. It seems likely that
for a while the lay-by will be small; but
the reserves (including premiums on shares)
are so solid that the co. can afford to dis-
tribute a larger proportion of profits than
it has usually done in the past: reserves at
September 30 amounted to 83 p.c. of paid
capital. Considering the premiums demanded
for earlier issues, shareholders have not done
very brilliantly. The latest issue will, how-
ever, improve things a little if the 12 p.c.
is maintained, and the rapid growth of
trusts makes that likely:—
1895.. £482,987 | 1915.. £2,953,604

1910.. 2,290,309 | 1925.. 6,480,945
Competition from two young but influential
rivals appears to have merely created ad-
ditional business —a common result of the
appearance of new trustee cos. The new
money was placed chiefly in public securities,
as this comparison shows: —

the directors. They don’t explain the fall
in profits and div.; but it was probably due
to the shipping strikes which afflicted the
period. One thing is pretty sure: the posi-
tion is no worse than it looks. Though for
the past four years barely enough profit
has been shown to pay the divs., it may be
taken for granted that ample provision has
first been made for depreciation, wastage and
all contingencies. For instance, though no
doubt the workmen are insured in the usual
way, there is also an accident insurance re-
serve, built up out of revenue not reckoned
in the table as profit, and now amounting
to £18,041. In the past year £3035 net was
sent in that direction —a larger amount than
usual, despite the reduced profit. You get

The long life and general adaptability of Pioneer
Wood Pipe are constantly corroborated in service
reports. Here is one from the manager of a big
butter factory: “The wood stave pipes we have in
use for the carrying away of the refuse water and
butter milk from the factory, a distance of a little
over a mile. We have found it an ideal pipe for this
purpose, causing us very little trouble whatever, and
although in use for nearly 10 years, we found on
cutting it recently that the wood was in a perfect
state of preservation, and appeared to be as good
as the day it was put in the ground.” Australian

Guthridge Ltd., 10 Parramatta Road, Camperdown
account for about £52,000. And while the
surplus has been growing not very rapidly,
it is true, during the past couple ot years
equipment has been added to and paid tor.
It is impossible to say how much has been
spent on this; certainly a good many thou-
sands. Last year £2066 was added to the
fixed assets: that is to say, the co. spent
that much plus whatever was written oft to
cover depreciation of every kind. Less the
dividend (nothing was paid for the first
half of the year) the liquid surplus amounted
to £50,262; and that’s a tidy lump to b«
held by a co. whose paid capital is only
£104,000. To represent the other £53,738
there is a mine of good-quality coal and the
Howard-Smith connection, which insures a
market so far as Mr. Walsh and a few others
allow anyone to have a market. Many a
poorer mine is valued at a great deal more.
The market, it is true, says these shares are
worth about 21/ —presumably os. 6d. for
the liquid assets and 11s. 6d. (£50,000) for
the mine and plant. The Howard-Smith
connection in probably not valued at all;
it has its advantages, but it also means that
the dividend is just what the big co. decides
that it shall be.

“K”: When Henry Ford was asked what
would happen to the motor trade when all
the petrol was used up he said there would
always be plenty of fuel so long as alcohol
could be made out of almost everything in
the vegetable kingdom. But that is not the
way the trade is looking at the fuel problem
to-day. In the first place, the date of the
exhaustion of petrol supplies has been set
forward for a great many years by improve-
ments in methods of drilling known oil-bear-
ing sands, and by the production of “cracked”
gasoline from the heavier oils. Not only
this, but some of the biggest corporations
of the United States are interesting them-
selves in the production of synthetic alcohol.
A method of manufacture has been patented,
based primarily on the reactions between the
constituents of “water-gas” (hydrogen and
carbon monoxide) in the presence of certain
heated metals under great pressure. The
process is very cheap, and the yield of alcohol
is said to be high. Australia’s low-grade
coals and lignites, unprofitable for most
other purposes, could be used to produce
water-gas as cheaply as it can be made any-
where. Pratten’s proposed bounty on alcohol
from cassava is some years behind the march
of science.

Despite the formation of at least a dozen
big cement cos. in the Commonwealth in
recent vears, and notwithstanding the bad
luck which has accompanied the National
Portland Cement Co. at Maria Island (Tas.),
yet another ambitious float is proposed. Mel-
rose district, not far from Devonport,
on the north coast of Tasmania, for
a long time has been providing large quanti-
ties of lime for the Newcastle steel works.
The proposed co., it has been stated, will
have a share capital of £750,000, but where
that sum is to be raised is not indicated.
The site adjoins the B. H. P. Co.’s limestone
quarries and an ontion over 500 acres has
been taken. J. A. Waucliope, lately with the
Mersey Valley Oil Co., is to act as engineer
to the venture. With so many old- and newly-
established cement cos. producing, and con-
sidering the present price of coal in Tas-
mania. the promoters have set themselves no
mean task.

Having taken a grip of the Read-Rose-
bery mines (Tas.), Electrolytic Zinc
has not wasted time. Mine buildings
and miners’ cottages are being built
at Rosebery and Williamsford. A party
of fitters has started to prepare the
large electric power-station to put it in com-
mission on the Dundas field. Work is being
pressed forward so that the mill will be work-
ing early in March. A mill capable of treat-
ing 600 tons of ore weekly is being installed
to handle outside ores from the Zeehan dis-
trict. The old Western mine and Clarke and
Duff’s mines should soon be working.

Star Explorations, Ltd., which carries on
a financial business in London, and is in-
terested in safe and not-so-safe ventures in
both hemispheres, had its annual roll-up the
other day. The chairman stated that as cer-
tain investments had been realised at a profit,
and as increased returns had been obtained
from others, a 5 p.c. div. would be paid. A
similar statement and a similar distribution
were made last year. The co. is believed to
be interested in Wiluna Development Syn-
dicate, but to what extent is not known.
Westralia’s State batteries, 20 in all, have
now produced about £6,000,000 worth of gold
and £lOO,OOO of tin. They cost something
under £410.000 to instal, and to date working
expenditure has exceeded revenue by
£140,000. But this loss is nothing compared
with the assistance which these plants have
rendered the industry. Without them and
the subsidies that the Government pays pri-
vate battery-owners for treating prospectors’
ore, gold- and tin-mining in the vVest would
be in a much worse state than it is.
* * * *
Recently it struck a number of Perth busi-
ness men that one of the reasons for the
decline in the Westralian gold output was the
scarcity of cash to put into promising shows.
As already recorded* they hurriedly gathered
together and resolved to form the Develop-
ment Trust Co., Ltd., with a nominal capital
of £62,5(10 and no free shares. There are
250,000 ss. shares in the co., of which 100,000
will be offered at par and the balance held
in reserve. No doubt a leaseholder or two
will be injured in the rush to submit “real
good things,” but as a number of the pro-
visional directors stated that any cash they
had hitherto put into mining was still there
they are not likely to be easily caught by
wild-catters. The co. does not propose to
confine its operations to mining, but will
consider any leg : timate enterprise.
s a * #
Eighteen months ago Brilliant Co. (W.A.)
had Gnow’s Nest inspected by a mining-man,
who reported that the show was exhausted
down to 2Soft., had a daily water inflow of
200,000 gallons and that nothing but a
miracle could ever make it a payable pro-
position. Notwithstanding this tip share-
holders insisted on acquiring the property.
Directors resigned, and a new Board was
elected. Since then money has been poured
into the mine in about the same volume as
water has been pumped out of it.. The
manager recently addressed a meeting of
dissatisfied Perth shareholders, and sug-
gested that old plant was the cause of all
the disappointments. A resolution was
passed condemning the Board, and accusing
it of suppressing information. A wife to
that effect despatched to the Adelaide office
elicited the prompt reply that all reports
issued by the manager had been published,
and that Perth shareholders were wrong in
saying otherwise. The facts about the much
maligned plant are: (1) It treated, when
operated by an earlier management, over
1000 tons monthly; (2) it kept the mine
dry without much effort; and (3) it enabled
good divs. to be paid while there was pay-
able ore available for treatment.
» » * *
For Ives Reward (W.A.) 1025 was a
year of much promise and overwhelming dis-
appointment. The Board, however, still has
faith, and with Government and sharehold-
ers’ assistance proposes to carry on. For
some time past there has been a serious dis-
crepancy between official assays and gold
recovery, and with a view to determine the
cause a big crushing will probably, be ex-
tracted under Government supervision and
treated away from the mine.
“Shareholder” writes:—
In fairness to Borneo Oil Option Syndicate, Ltd.,
the remarks of A. O. Capell (B. 7/l/'26) re Bux
Syndicate and Borneo oil titles call for examination.
Mr. Capell states: “After my London experience, I
consider it waste of time and money to try to get
a satisfactory final title for oil in Dutch Borneo or
Dutch East Indies.” When options over four oil
and two coal concessions in Borneo were first dis-
cussed by the Perth promoters of Borneo Oil Syndi-
cate, Ltd., the promoters held similar views to
those expressed by him. Before doing business,
therefore, they despatched Michael T. Williams to
Java to ascertain the position with regard to titles.
In due course Williams reported as follows: “Oil
permits, which simply gave permission to expend
money on general prospecting and oil boring, were
easily enough obtained, and, in the event of subse-
quent operations on the field being successful, a
concession area, having a 25 years’ tenure, might
be granted in lieu of the permit by the Netherlands
East Indies Government. To obtain what is known
as a coal or oil concession (75 years’ tenure, sub-
ject to rental but involving no labor conditions)
was extremely difficult. As a matter of fact, it was
impressed on me that the authorities had ceased
granting oil concessions, particularly in the oil-
producing district of East Borneo. The last of such
concessions granted in this area was in 1921, and
it was over six of these that I finally secured options.
According to assurances of Netherlands East Indies
authorities, supported by the best legal opinions in
Java, our titles to these concessions are perfect.
Rentals payable for the concessions total about £3OO
yearly, but these figures were known prior to my
departure from Perth.” The position, so far as the
8.0.0.5., Ltd., is concerned, is, therefore, much better
than Mr. Capell suggests, and the question of in-
security of title should not prejudice its chances
of getting capital in London.

Flagstone (N.S.W.) reports an improved
outlook in both tunniels on the parent lease.
The Cartwheel crosscut sounds like a freak.
It has reached 25ft., ai.d Mackenzie states
that "it is developing so exceptionally that
all the ore broken from here will average
6 p.c. tin oxide per ton.” This view is
corroborated by C. Alma Baker, whose re-
cent. inspection recruited an enthusiastic
supporter. The teamsters appear to have
wakened up a little, and the heavy machinery
from Butler’s is being carted across. The
Sydney office expects the stamps to be drop-
ping at the end of March, but Baker says

New White Crystal, Ardlethan (N.S.W.),

expenditure totalled £3373. Capital stands at
£18,355, there being 53,075 shares still left
on the register and paid to 6s. lid. each.
The Board elected in May has not drawn
any fees, and docs not intend to raid the
cash-box unlil finances are stronger. The
plant is reported in good order and warranted
to run without interruption, and ore supplies
from Crosby's Hill will shortly be available
to give the mill a chance. The co. has £2750
in cash with which to make a start, and an
unnegotiated p.n. for £305 figures among the
assets.

Lucknow Pups (N.S.W.) believes that the
pyrites is denser than previously in the
rise on No. 5 vein, which is here about
4ft. wade. Assays last week gave 9oz. 16dwt.,
9oz. 2dwt., 4oz. 17dwt. and 3oz. sdwt. re-
spectively. The market assessment of these
prospects is about 4d.

Carpathia (N.S.W.) is looking better be-

4 tons concentrates from 06 tons.

Mount Morgan has been pumping since
November 7, g.-m. Boyd having satisfied him-
self that the fire has been extinguished. The
water is precipitated on to scrap iron, and
about six tons of copper will be thus pro-
duced per week. Before the co. would move
in the matter of the new treatment proposals,
chairman J. M. Niall saw Fremier McCor-
mack. Fresh leases for the statutory period
of 21 years have been promised. The small
experimental scheme for paining from the
present open-cut at the rate of about 2750
tons of low-grade ore weekly is being pro-
ceeded with. The ore will be treated by con-
centration, roasting and reverb, smelting.
The scheme will call for a small capital out-
lay, and there will doubtless be some loss
on operations, but advantages are: (a) the
feasibility or otherwise of the big scheme of
Ojpen-cut workings will be ascertained; (b)
retention bf the principal employees who
would be required for the larger plans. Smelt-
ing should commence early in May.

“G.D.M.” insists that it is a joke:—
In his report to the Federal Government on the
probable origin of the bitumen found on the southern
beaches of Australia Dr. Wade has let his humorous
proclivities have full freedom. He states that Dr.
Simpson, of the W.A. Mines Department, told him
that he had identified some samples with material
used by Norwegian whalers, for caulking their boats.
"Most important finds of this bitumen were always
found near old whaling stations such as Cheyne
Pay (W.A.), Kangaroo Island (S.A.) and on the
coast of Tasmania.” Dr. Wade concludes that these
trusting whalers buried their caulking bitumen in
the coastal sands probably to save space, or to pre-
vent the material from weathering and becoming too
much oxidised. From the large quantity of bitumen
found from Otway to Leeuwin, there must have been
a thousand whalers hiding their asphaltum along a
coastline of 950 miles. The stuff Dr. Wade saw
vas hardened by exposure. But 1 have found bitumen
as plastic as chewing-gum on the S.A., Vic., W.A.
ar.d Tasmanian beaches—fresh stuff which would
i'oat on sea-water and evidently came from the con-
tinental shelf after a submarine upheaval.

Those who put cash into Kawarau (M.L.)
cos. (now Amalgamated Kawarau) in the
belief that active gold-mining would com-
mence about July last year will not be
appeased overmuch by the latest bulletin
from the Wakatipu front. This states that
the wing dam to divert the water from the
site of No. 10 pier has been completed, and
that “work on the foundation of this pier
will commence immediately. This will leave
only piers 6 and 7 to be completed.” Work
has been hampered for some weeks by the
high level of Lake Wakatipu, but a sub-
sidence of 26in. in the water has enabled
the engineers to get going again.

Mandated Development Co. flits from site
to site and starts the drill afresh. No. 3
bore was abandoned at 507 ft. owing to “cav-
ing troubles.” and No. 4 lias been commenced.
Meantime the oil-pools, if any, remain un-
disturbed.
The suggestion to Ronpibon that perhaps
if “boring, jungle-clearing and other develop-
mental work were undertaken the Govern-
ment might be influenced to grant an exten-
sion of the Thalerm leases” did not come
from the Siamese Government, as the “Wild
Cat” suggested last week, but from the share-
holders’ meeting. Chairman A. W. Palfrey-
man declared the position serious; so, what-
ever its origin, the suggestion seems reason-
able and worth exploring.

“Light Horse” : In all the feast of reminis-
cence and the flow of bowl at the welcomes
accorded to Allenby, I have hea’rd no refer-
ence to the cause of an ever-recurring feud
between “The Bull” and his Light Horse
myrmidons—-the wearing of “shorts.” In
the furnace of the Sinai desert the wide
khaki knickers were adopted as a welcome
relief from the intolerable heat of the heavy
Bedford cord riding breeches. Originally
issued for fatigue and camp duties, they be-
came the regular w’ear of men and most
officei’S in the hot weather, and the unsol-
dierly outrage on smartness of Appearance
was winked at by the Higher Lips, till Allen-
by came on the scene, and launched an offen-
sive against the brief garments. The Horse-
men were equally determined to stick to
them, and the war raged from Beersheba to
the Jordan. Order followed on order, shorts
being condemned as unsoldierly, unseemly
and insanitary, since sores were apt to
develop dangerously on the bare knees in
that fly-cursed land. When they were with-
drawn the regiments retaliated by cutting
off the legs of the breeches issued “in lieu.”
Just as something dreadful seemed likely to
happen, some genius hit on a compromise
which saved the face of each side. Shorts
were surrendered, but long “slacks” were
permitted, instead of the almost unendurable
breeches and leggings. All hands were happy
and able to turn undivided attention to
Liman von Sanders and his merry men.

“Bilbav”: The handcuffs from which
N.S.W. police have refused to be parted are
objects of scorn to some delinquents. I was
on guard one night in a Tommy training-
camp -when the town picket brought in a
hard-case Cockney. He was very blotto, and
we had some difficulty in jugging him; after-
wards he became so obstreperous that the
sergeant of the guard, a drill-instructor of
the old school, sent me to put the “darbies”
on the prisoner. Next morning we went in
to see him, and found him sitting on a bench
with the handcuffs hanging on a nail. The
sarge, after recovering from the shock,
wanted to manacle his prisoner again, and
the Cockney raised no objections. “But you’re
only wasting your time putting those things
on me,” he said; “I can get out of them
any time. Stick ’em on again and I’ll show
you.” We obliged him. Taking the right
handcuff in the left hand he gave it a swipe
on the edge of the bench just behind the
hinge, and it came open. A second blow
opened the left one, and he nonchalantly
handed the bracelets back to the astonished
n.c.o. “It’s all in the way you hit ’em.”

hole cut in one side sufficient for a man to

of the axe tipcatted up two more pounds, and
the householder ceased operations to investi-
gate the box-block. Presently, from a hole
in the side, he drew the remnants of a rotten
canvas bag; his total haul was 25 sovereigns,
all of ancient vintage. Whose long-lost or
forgotten safe-deposit it was is still a mys-
tery.

“Burglar’s Laborer”: Contemporaneously
with the development of the finger-print
system, jtlie scientific criminal has discovered
a way of forging the tell-tale marks. He
secures impressions of the prints of some
other man, and puts models thereof into
the finger-tips of the gloves without which
no really up-to-date criminal works. So
the police are liable to be lured away on
false scents. The fact that such tricks may
be played affects the value that can be
placed upon finger-print evidence; but, actu-
ally, the police do not rely upon prints to
secure convictions so much as to narrow the
field of investigation. When prints are passed
to the expert he can usually in a few minutes
decide to whom they belong; the next step is
to concentrate on the movements of the sus-
pected man at the time the crime was com-
mitted. The use of false finger-prints will
produce complications when the suspected
man is able to prove he was a hundred miles
away that night.
* * * *
“Schnorrer” : Pentridge Gaol admitted its
queerest Visitors to date when members of
the Melbourne Beth Din—the supreme _ reli-
gious authority in a Jewish community—
arrived there to secure a “Get” from a Jew-
ish prisoner. The “Get” is a short docu-
ment which supplies the simple means for
a Jewish divorce; traditionally the document
by signing w r hich the Jew divorces his wife
(the Jewess lacks a similar power and can-
not get her freedom without her husband’s
consent) contains 12 lines. Hence the name ;
the letters G.T. signify 12. In this case
the lady is probably seeking her civil divorce,
but would not regard herself as properly
freed unless the requirements of Jewish reli-
gious law had been fulfilled, too.
* * * *
“Kerys” : Not long ago a girl who landed
at Auckland (M.L.) from an overseas vessel,
having seen her
luggage through
the Customs, was
walking up the
long wharf with
her friends, when a
small man came
panting after her.
“Excuse me, Miss,’’
he said, “but my
missus dropped a
small parcel near
you and she thinks
it went into your
umbrella.” Where
upon lie thrust his
hand into the
gamp, which hung
by a strap on the
girl’s arm, retrieved
what looked like a
small tin, and
trotted up-town.
Tli e explanation
seemed quite fea-
sible to the party,
but a hardened
parent listened furi-
ously and said
“Opium !”
* * *
“P.R.T.": A Bris-
bane sneak-thief,
up before the beak
for stealing two
suits of pyjamas,
pleaded to be let
off with a fine be-
cause he had not
made anything out
of the 21 previous
thefts h e was
charged with. He
got a month. This
recalls a Mel-
bourne solicitor’s
plea for a man
charged with steal-
ing a pair of trous-
ers : “The pants
didn't fit.’’ Ic helped him to get off, too.
* * * *
“Killick’’: Sheltered in a small dugout the
few of us left on Battalion H.Q. listened to
the crash of the barrage which proclaimed our
men’s attack on a tough position. Presently
through Fritz’s counter-barrage came stag-
gering in two brigade-runners and pulled up
panting. The C.O. and adjutant dived for
the envelope, naturally anticipating some im-
portant order or change of plan, and the rest
FAMILY SECRETS.
GERTIE : “Good evening, Mr. Mud.”
CALLER: “You amusing little girl! My
name's not Mr. Mud.”
GERTIE: “Isn't it? My sister told daddy it
was!”
of ns waited in tense expectation. The
adjutant’s face grew apoplectic as he ran his
eye over the message, and it was in a chok-
ing voice he read out: “Forward without
delay names of tw’o suitable men for cooks'
school to commence in three weeks’ time.”

SINCE YOUTH MUST KNOW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Long since, dear lass, I’ve had my fling
With jocund dames and damsels gay,
And I have ceased from wondering
At wilful woman’s winsome way;
But, bless me ! though I’ve had my day,
You fain would practise to inspire
In me a spark of passion’s ire
Sufficient for your pleasantry 1
Am 1 the trophy you require?
I’Ve had my day, so let me be.
Bring no pretence of comforting
My lonely heart and ‘ head of grey;
I know that trick of cosseting
A flame of fervor into play.
But, bless me! though I’ve had my day,
I greatly fear, since you inquire,
This embered warmth may yet be dire
If you should fan too fervently ;
And though your bright eyes I admire,
I’ve had my day, so let me be.
To all fair ladies wantoning ,
I’ve said farewell; and so I say
With you I’ll not go junketing
To gather rosebuds while I may.
But, bless me! though I’ve had my day,
They run a risk who play with fire;
And while an ember "of desire
May smoulder in the ash of me
I' think it wiser to retire—
I’ve had my day, so let me be.
Envoy.
My daughter, if you must aspire
To play upon the half-strung lyre
Of doting folly’s ecstas.y,
Beware of passion’s smouldering pyre....
I’ve had my day, so let me be.

“Lomkey Ree”: These persons who can
find nothing better to do than pad the hoof
about God’s green earth begin to tire me.
Three young Australians loped into my office on
Christmas Eve and presented a card setting
forth that they were on a six years’ walking
tour over Australia and aroqnd the world.
By way of explanation their spokesman
jerked out: “Jest walking—don’t want any-
thing—must be pushing off—so long.”
And on they went. Only a few weeks sooner
a pedestrian, a native of Lightning Ridge
DEEPENING THE PORT.
LADY PASSENGER (to Chief Officer) :
“Can you tell me, please, Mr.
Legpulle, why that water keeps
flowing out of the ship’s side?
Does she leak?”
THE MATE : “Oh no, Madam. You see this harbor’s silting up. So
we’ve got to bring in as much ocean water as tee can, and
pump it in so as to deepen it.”
(N.S.W.), oozed in and mentioned he had
come from Darwin, via Broome and Eucla.
and was bound for Melbourne. He had
black opal for sale, but made no strenuous
effort to dispose of it. Contemporaneously
one Aidan de Brune hopped along, gasped
out a lecture on the Territory (no charge)
and drifted into the night to finish the round
trip of the continent at Sydney. Probably
I missed some, but all these blew in lately.
Is it the development in Australia of the
martyr spirit, which B. Shaw has described
as the cheapest way of getting fame without
brains? And if so can’t anything be done
to batten it down before it becomes a habit
in Australia?
* * * *
“P. Tenax”: A paragraphist recently men-
tioned a church garnished inside with mir-
rors, and suggested that such furnishings
werd without precedent. They aren’t. It is
more than 20 years since Arthur Bentley
Worthington founded a new religion in
Christchurch (M.L.) and housed it and a
numerous army of adherents in the Temple
of Truth. The temple’s walls were inscribed
with strange geometric designs and the names
of famous men, but the most striking feature
was the mirrors, which covered the whole
wall-space from the top of a 3-foot wains-
coting to a height of about Bft. They helped
to make the temple extremely popular with
a mostly feminine congregation, and the reli-
gion might have growm and prospered had it
not been discovered that the saintly founder
had a police record and was of polygamous
tendencies. He vanished from the scene
after an attempt to come back that caused
a public riot, but the temple remained. For
years it was used for concerts and lectures
under the name of the Choral Hall, and its
mirrors have reflected the classic contours of
such great political figures as Seddon, Tommy
Taylor, Joe Ward and Massey. When
Massey was there the mirrors saw him mostly
engaged in dodging missiles thrown by a
crowd of strongly anti-Massey tendencies,
which had entered after battering down the
door with a post. It cost a few hundreds
to repair the temple after that bout and
some of the glass got broken.
“Fitzcray”: Long ago The Bulletin pub-
lished a story of a lady in the ’Loo whose
habit of locking herself up in the house with
her husband and yelling bloody murder as
she hurled the crockery about earned the
aforesaid spouse, the most long-suffering and
inoffensive of men, the reputation of a loathly
wife-beater and near-murderer. The yarn
has been almost exactly paralleled in real life
and a Coburg (Vic.) police court, where a
lady lately sued her husband for support,
and accused him of every atrocity possible.
It looked a bad case till witnesses swore they
had seen the complainant stab herself with
a knife, cut her head by banging it against
a tap and manufacture other circumstantial
evidence. They gave the husband a good
character, too, and, the plaintiff having, ap-
propriately enough, defined herself as “a
war-bride,” a puzzled Bench thought it good
enough for a dismissal.
“Nakhoda”: J. Krishnamurti, whom
Annie B e s a n t
claims to be the
next great world
teacher, isn’t the
first Messiah that
has arisen in
modern times.
About 1830 a citi-
zen of U.S.A. found
he was the Son of
God, and declared
that all who did
not accept his
message would be
reduced to clinkers.
A large following,
including persons
of rank and posses-
sions, listened to
him, until a Ger-
man in his audience
respectfully arose
an d asked the
Messiah to repeat
hi s message in
German, as it
seemed a pity that
large numbers of
h i s countrymen
who did not under-
stand English must
be damned on that
accoun t. Th e
would-be saviour
confessed frankly
that he did not
spe a k German.
“What,” said the
Teuton, “you the
Son of God and un-
able to speak all
languages! You
are a fraud and an
impostor.” Whereat
the assemblage
gave their would-be
deliverer the loud
laugh, and his sub-
sequent meetings
were so poorly attended that he had to
abandon the business.
“A.8.W.”: The close resemblance of the
Outtrim brothers (B. 14/l/’26) prompts m e
to quote a parallel case—that of my twin
nieces. One girl holds a Government job in
a country town —call it Woop—and her
sister is training at a metropolitan public
hospital. One of the Woop girl’s admirers
was called to the city suddenly to see a sick
relative in the hospital, and nearly collapsed
when the subject of his dreams —or her appa-
rition —came into the ward in nursing garb.
“Holy smoke! When did you join the hos-
pital staff?” inquired the flabbergasted swain.
“Yesterday?” “You are a very rude person,”
remarked the nurse; “please don’t remain
with the patient too long,” and she walked
off. “Half a minute!” exclaimed the amazed
young man, springing after her. “Wliat’s
the joke?” The lady turned wrathfully.
“I’m afraid I shall have to call the gatemen
OPPORTUNITIES AMPLE.
THE PROUD MOTHER: "Yes, when John and I quarrel I am always
careful to send the children out of the house."
THE JEALOUS FRIEND: “Why, yes, the darlings look so healthy
from spending their time in the open air.”
and have you removed.” He pondered the
insult, but it was a brain-wave, not a chucker-
out, that seized him. “I beg your pardon,
nurse; there has been a _ slight misunder-
standing. Have you a sister at Woop?”
And then, of course, it was all explained.
“Hotliam”: Maoriland is not the only
place where the soused motorist is liable to
find himself gaoled without the op. (B.
14/l/’26). Melbourne magistrates are hand-
ing out the same salutary discipline without
regard for the offender’s position. Recent
convictions included a well-known solicitor
and a suburban alderman of some financial
tonnage. Even the safety-first tactics of one
individual who parked his car and proceeded
to sleep it off in the tonneau did not avail
him. The result has been a wholesome scare
among car-driving revellers. This was shown
by the conduct of one conscience-stricken in-
dividual who was driving a van to the best
of his ability when he noticed a policeman
regarding him closely from the kerb. He
pulled up, and, getting out, fell into the John
Hop’s arms, saying that it was no uslie, and
that he had berrer own up. This so touched
the beak next morning that the penitent
escaped with a fine.
* * * *
“Wang” : The number of Chinese vegetable-
hawkers, quack doctors and laundrymen who
claim English-sounding names is amazing.
Doubtless some of the Chinks Anglicise their
names in the hope of stimulating business,
but I think more owe their new labels to
the tradesmen who paint the same on their
carts or windows. I have in my mind a
yellow vegetable-liawker who calls himself
Peter Pan and who hawks his wares in a
motor-waggon. When he first started in
business the coachbuilder who made Ah Sin’s
cart asked him what name he wanted on it.
[,Vh Sin held up a cigarette-box. “You printero
this,” he said. Hence he has become a per-
ambulating advertisement for a brand of
cigarette, and at the same time a source of
perplexity to many kids who can’t conceive
of Barrie’s joyous youth turning into a
Chow. Some years ago a Chinese, hauled up
before a Melbourne suburban court for a
contravention of the municipal bylaws,
astonished the beaks by giving his name as
John Bull, and sure enough his cart out-
side supported the claim. An outraged im-
perialist fined John the maximum.
“Sappho Sudds” : When Old Bill, from the
Yodda passed out. after courting Janet for
ten years, invariably promising to marry her
next trip and swearing that his will was
made out in her favor, poor Janet came weep-
ing bitterly to tell us. “I wouldn t have
felt it so badly if he had kept lus promise
about that money,” she declared; but it
was the falseness of him dying intestine that
made me feel I can never trust a man again.
* # * *
“Resurgam”: Myriads of people must have
wondered why a central block along-
side the old G.T’.O. in Elmabeth-street, Mel-
bourne, is covered
by an ancient and
shabby galvanised-
iron shed. The
reason seems to be
that neither the
State nor the Fed-
er a 1 Government
has ever been quite
clear about its
right to the ground.
Yet the Crown’s
title seems unshak-
able. In 1916 one
of many claimants
for the land alleged
that he had pur-
chased it 60 years
previously. A
search at the Titles
Office disclosed that
there had never
been any dealings
with the block,
part of the original
lot 20, and further
that the land had
not at any time
been alienated by
the Crown. The
old building was
once used as a tele-
graph office, and is
now partly a lunch-
room for messen-
gers and a shop for
motor accessories.
There have been
nearly a hundred
claimants for this
allotment, but not
one could show a
scrap of paper in
proof of ownership.
The land has a
frontage to Eliza-
beth-street of 35ft.
by a depth of 132 ft.
to Little Bourke-
street and is worth
at the lowest
£70,000 at £2OOO a
foot. At present it is a blotch on the city’s
face ’ *
“Retired Volt”: I thought I had the
travel-germ, but my Melbourne charlady
leaves me standing. She is 65, has had 12
children, of whom she has reared seven, and
they have provided her with 50 grandchildren
(approx.) ; she married a “baddie” and
buried him, and has since done 13 years at
other people’s wash-tubs. Out of the pro-
ceeds of this underpaid toil she saved £l5O
and shouted herself a trip to England a few
years ago. She has now saved nearly enough
for another world-canter which she intends
to take (d.v.) at the earliest opportunity.
THE CURE.
ELDERLY HUSBAND : “I would, make a woman
like you pay income-tax on your figure.
You wouldn’t be so darned ready to
reveal it then.”
“Wallaby”: It was up beyond Roisel in
’lB, when the front line consisted of a
succession of posts spaced at considerable
intervals, and No Man’s Land was a place
to lose oneself in. The movements in broad
daylight on our flank of a Tommy officer and
his party of three, carrying between them
a board like an estate-agent’s “To Let”
notice, had attracted attention. They had
not seen us, and were well out beyond our
post when they came to a halt and set up
the board. Turning my glasses on it. I read:
“Reserved for 199th Howitzer Battery.”
Several days later the board had disappeared,
but the battery was there.

Just dead Lord Carmichael had a gift
of dry humor that endeared him to Mel-
bourne reporters during his term as State
Governor. Once at a show Drysdale Brown,
then Attorney-General, spoke of the need of
population. His Ex, concurred, but slyly
remarked that one of the guests at the table
who owned 17 kiddies had evidently a
stronger appreciation of the need than
Brown, who was a bachelor. His Ex. also
took a fall out of Peacock, who proposed his
health after Carmichael had been installed
as grand panjandrum of tlier compass and
keystone brigade. He said that, though
S’Alec seemed to be a mine of information con-
cerning his career that night, when he was
appointed rubber-stamp the Government of
which Peacock was a member had to cable
to the Colonial Office to ask who the deuce
he was.
In his choice of the newly-enrolled batch
of Labor Councillors, N.SAV. Premier Lang
exercised a taste for variety. Included in
the 25 are the tallest (W. P. Kelly), heavies f
(W. Carey) and smallest ( C. Akhurst) three
in the Council,
while W. E. Dick-
son, the Barrier
pressman who flew
over from Broken
Hill to Sydney to
be sworn in, is the
baby of the House,
having passed no
more than 31 mile-
stones.
W.S. DENNY .
Atforney-General
of S. Aus., the
hard-hitter of
the present
Labor team.
Viscount Allenby's only son, a lad of barely
20, was killed in action in 1917. The title
descends, by special remainder, to the F.M.’s
brother. Captain Frederick Allenby, a re-
tired naval officer, and said brother’s heirs
male; the captain’s only son is a lieutenant
in the lltli Hussars.
One of the world’s authorities on dentis-
try, Dr. Hayes Norman, has just died in
Adelaide. It was 63 years ago, when he
was only 19, that Norman started gum-
digging. That was a time when the prac-
tice of dentistry was crude and entry into
the profession was unregulated. (When the
first Dental Act, insisting upon qualifica-
tions, was passed in N. S. Wales it was
found that one of the most successful Sydney
practitioners had changed over from his ori-
ginal trade as a plumber to the plumbing of
teeth.) Norman’s codification of dental
knowledge in his numerous books made his
reputation almost world-wide.
E. C. Playford, son of the dead Senator
for South Australia, is to rule the decaying
institutions of the Northern Territory in
succession to Administrator Urquhart, who
retired last week. He is an old tropical offi-
cial who has directed mines and other in-
activities from Darwin. He will only wield
the sceptre in an acting capacity, however,
pending the passing of the new bill which
will split the Northern Territory into two
parts, one of them to be directed by one
potentate from Alice Springs and the other
by a second nabob from Newcastle Waters.
Frank Thomson, as head of the new Prime
Minister’s Department in M.L., will get a
cheer from everyone on the inside of poli-
tics in the Shaky Islands. He has been the
memory, the men-
tor and more often
than not the con-
science and the
brains of Maori-
land Premiers for
more than 20 years.
He graduated B.A.
at Wellington a
quarter of a cen-
tury ago, and has
secretaried for Sed-
don, Millar, Ward,
Massey and
Coates; during
Massey’s long ill-
ness he practically
was Prime Minis-
ter. Latterly he
has had ranks as
Clerk to the Ex-
ecutive Council, and
while in London
with Massey they
tied a C.M.G. on
to him.
General JOHN
GELLIBRAND,
the new M.H.R.
for Denison ( Tas. ).
James Allen, who retires shortly from the
fatiguing job of reminding London that
Maoriland is on the map, is a pugnacious
and self-willed person who when in politics
made more enemies than friends. It wasn’t
so. much what he said as the nasty way he
said it that got him disliked by the enemy.
Ilis big opportunity came as Defence Minis-
ter from 1914 to 1919 with the administration
of conscription. The Shivery Isles are now
able to boast, and do boast, that they sent
over to the Big Scrap a bigger quota of light-
ing men in ratio to population than any other
part of the Empire, Mother excepted; but
the process was not universally popular while
it was proceeding, and Allen was no better
loved afterwards than he was before. The
knight, who was born in South Australia 70
years ago, doesn’t look his age, and if his
party wants him to take a portfolio or any
little thing like that on his return he will be
unlikely to say nay.
Just returned with a couple of cabin-trunks
full of notes and reports from a 12 months’
tour of America and Europe, IT. P. Colwell,
the 36-year-old chief electrical engineer of
Vic. railways. Grown and trained in Vic-
toria, he is Clapp’s most precocious young-
ster, and settled in the electrical chiefs
armchair at the age of 30—15 years after
first saying 99 for the medical officer. ITis
overhead cables are steadily advancing from
Melbourne. Fern Tree Gully and Lilydale
have been reached, and the next extensions
will be from Eltham to Hurstbridge and
Williamstown to Altona.
A well-known Australian professor, re-
cently knighted, has long been famous on
account of his corkscrew trousers. He
seemed to pull them on twisted in the morn-
ing, and to spend his days by adding to their
convolutions at the University. He is sin-
gularly unconventional, and the story is still
told of how he once changed from his city
suit into a boiled shirt and swallowtails
under a pepper-tree by the light of the moon,
after which he descanted before a vice-regal
audience upon Meredith’s poetry. In those
days the professor inhabited a suite of rooms
in a boarding-house, where his atrocious
pants are said to have wrested from a scorn-
ful maid the exclamation in the owner’s
presence that she would sooner die than be
seen going up the street until him “if he had
them on.”
There was a familiar flavor about the atti-
tude of young Fercival Stephenson, 8.A..
of Ipswich (Q.), who recently fell into mild
liolts with the authorities of Oxford. He
was getting gratis instruction there as
a Rhodes scholar, and was using it as a
base and the defunct imperialist’s money as a
means to organise against Britain’s Empire
and its form of civilisation; at least he
was charged with inciting Indian students
to Communism. The young man was told to
leave or leave off. In selecting the latter
alternative he said Oxford was acting up to
its “conservative traditions,” and that its
authorities “are notorious for their resistance
to the new vital ideas of each succeeding
generation.” Queensland’s own solitary uni-
versity is only 15 years old, and in propor-
tion to population is the least patronised
in the Commonwealth (the students number
one per 2095 inhabitants, while S. Australia
has one per 275). Still, Queensland’s favored
son is disposed to stand no nonsense, even
from an institution 1047 years old.
Scotching rumors that he was going to
India to help Birdie, Gen. Blarney, Vic. Chief
of Police, told the force, at a picnic the other
day that he was sticking to his job. When
he was assailed in both State Houses before
Christmas the Ministry stood up for him
manfully, and he owes it something. Besides,
it is not so easy to get £l5OO a year and £250
allowance for any military job likely to be
going in his line.
Old Queenslanders will prick their ears
at the news that one Fitzroy Somer-
set has given the Queensland Agent-
General a privately-printed copy of the
memoirs of Sir Thomas Brisbane, Gov-
ernor of N.S.W. from 1821 to 1824 and god-
father of the City of Brisbane. Fitzroy
Somerset was an identity in the Queensland
of long ago, and played many parts, from
squatting to Labor agent on a blackbirder.
He was one of a notable band of young Eng-
lishmen brought in by Oscar de Satge, of
Peak Downs, as “colonial experiencers” in
the ’sixties. They were a carefully-selected
lot, and nearly all of them did well in vari-
ous walks of Queensland life. Fitzroy Somer-
set is one of the few survivors.
Joined the heavenly choir, at 83, Charles
Sykes, Melbourne organist. He dated from
the time when Hill, Giorza and David Lee
gave operatic fantasias the star place in
their programmes. His improvisations on
Irish tunes were a recognised feature of
Hibernian festivities, and it was at R.C.
churches that most of his half-century’s play-
ing was heard.
Tom Murray, the flaxen-liaired N.S.W.
Honorable who refuses to be dishonorable at
Premier Lang’s bidding, is one of the
wealthiest men in the Ma State’s Upper
House. Starting from scratch, less than 20
years ago, he drove a butcher’s cart around
Cowra for a crust, afterwards setting up in
business as a stock and station agent. He
never looked back and nowadays his baili-
wick runs out to Bourke. Appointed to the
Council in 1920, he was the first choice then
of the Caucus, being the only candidate to
secure election on the first count. During
the life of the last Labor Administration he
was chairman of the State Wheat Board.
He was a member of the syndicate that
acquired W. M. Hughes’s wooden ships for
a mere song, and also pocketed a fat com-
mission when he disposed of the old Royal
Hotel property on behalf of the Savings
Bank Commissioners.
One of the last survivors of the men who
rode with Kossuth was Dr. J. M. Flateau,
of Mosman, just dead at 93. The wild up-
heaval sent him to Australia at the age of
23, and since that day the energetic and
sometimes fiery little Pole played many parts.
He was a well-known figure in the North
Queensland of the ’nineties, when he was
a director and most of the shareholders of
a bismuth-mine somewhere behind Bowen.
He always nursed a mild grievance because
the men of the Towers and Townsville were
too obsessed with gold to give attention to
bismuth.
The giddy young tilings in Government
departments who go out at 60 or 65 will blush
to read of the retirement of Jim Fitzgibbon,
the Taralga-Golspie (N.S.W.) mail contrac-
tor, who has held the job for 50 years. Jim
has turned 80, and has decided to have a rest
for a while. The Taralga district, 2200 feet
above sea-level, breeds men like that. It is
not so long ago that a dinner was given in
the district at which the youngest of 40
guests was a stripling of 76. One of the
diners, aged 85, confessed that he could “feel
the old man coming on him a bit,” but he
rode 20 miles home that night.
The Wood, Son and Co. dry-goods firm in
Adelaide is in its third generation. Gilbert
Wood founded the firm; his son Peter was
the first chairman of directors when it be-
came a company; and latterly James Gart-
rell, a partner from the old retail-shop days,
has been chairman. Now all these are gone,
and the new chairman is Robert Wood, son
of Peter. Incidentally, his wife is another
grandchild of Gilbert Wood, being the
daughter of E. ,T. Ilorwood, Broken Kill
manager of the 8.11. Prop.
Handed out his last roll over the head-
office counter, paymaster E. J. Ilourigan,
of the Vic. railways, who retires on a pension
after 44 years in the accountancy branch.
Hourigan, who has been in charge of the
most popular omce m the service since
1914, could flick the notes like a card-
sharper and never forgot the face or name
of a man who came up to the paysheet. He
was president of the Mulgrave Shire Council
in 1923, the first Vie. railwayman to accept
such a position.
“0.P.H.”: Melbourne dailies have been
filling in the silly season by saying a lot
about Senator Wilson. His prospects of be-
ing appointed either as a coadjutor to the
High Commissioner or Director of Migration
have been exhaustively canvassed. How such
a superman as Wilson is represented to be
could have been turned down by the Crow-
eaters is past the understanding of tile
Melbourne papers. Most big politicians have,
however, had to stand a toss on the bust
ings—-Barton, Berry, Parkes, _ Gillies, Watt
and others—and much less ink was shed
over them than over Wilson, who has had
a mighty good innings in the last six years.
Groperland Premier Collier was holding
forth to a lively House one recent evening.
“Let me tell the members over yonder,” he
declared, “that there are more farmers
in the Labor Government than in the Oppo-
sition. There are men on this side of the
House who know more about the great
silences of the bush than the lion, members
opposite who prate so much about them.”
Country-party leader Alex. Thomson inter-
jected: “Where are these great silences of
the bush?” Collier pointed a finger at the
recumbent Charley Maley (a cocky member
who hasn’t said a word for five years).
“There,” he declared dramatically, “there
is one of them; and,” swinging round to
George Barnard, of Busselton, also famed
for the number of things he doesn’t say, and
at that moment peacefully sleeping, “there
is the other.”
Miss May Holman, W.A.’s lone woman
legislator, dropped into the safe Labor seat
for Forrest, where the timber mills are, when
her dad died a year ago, but whether she
will win the Labor nomination twice is quite
another question. J. B. Holman, who was
once a Minister, won—and lost- —that dis-
tinction in the days when Labor Premiers
claimed and enforced the right, iong since
wrested from them by caucus, to choose and
dispense with their own colleagues. It Was
the late Harry Daglish, the first Laborite
to form an Administration in Groperland.
who included Holman in his Cabinet in 190 i
and bumped him out a year iater, The ex-
Minister stayed in Parliament, with one brief
break, for 20 years and was always a
prominent union secretary, but he never
succeeded in clambering back to office again.
L. H. HARNETT, Sergeant-at-Arms of the
N.B.W. Leg. Assembly, who has been
kept rather busy the last few weeks.
“O.II.” : The late J. L. Purves, leader of
the Bar in Melbourne, often scored off the
police in cross-examination, but one seasoned
J. Hop got even with him. “How long have
you been in the Force?” queried J.L. of his
old victim. “Since about twinty years be-
fore O’Hara thrashed ye,” was the unex-
pected reply. While a thronged court
grinned, I*urves protested that O’Hara did
nothing of the sort. Whenever he was re-
quired to put a date on anything the old
constable insisted upon taking “the time
O’Hara 1 thrashed ye” as the basis of reckon-
ing, and J.L. had to give him up as hope-
less. As a fact honors were just about even
when Purves and O’Hara, the eminent Mel-
bourne surgeon, had their dust-up in Oollins-
street over 30 years ago.
MERCTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“With the death of Cardinal Mercier, which
occurred last Saturday (23rd), passed one of the
war’s greatest heroes. It was his serene courage
and his indignant protests against outrages that
shamed the Governor of Belgium, Von Bissing, into
checking excesses by the German troops in occupation :
in that respect he was the saviour of his people.”
His courage turned the edge of bullies’ swords.
Against the victors, undismayed he stood,
With noble purpose armed, till weaponed lords
Of war grew shamed of bloody hardihood.
So he, the champion of his people’s good,
Rights for the conquered from the conqueror wrought
When only wanton wrong had been their thought.
Courage to high intention in him wed,
His was the triumph of the perfect mind.
No blustering might could bow the hero’s head,
No threatening fear divert his footsteps’ tread;
He checked the seas of lust and tamed the wind.
The massed, armed might of brutal force was checked
In the calm presence of his intellect
No tear for him who in his last hour breathed:
“Now am I ready to depart in peace!”
The reverent thoughts of all the world are wreathed
Around the monument he has bequeathed—
The memory of deeds that shall not cease
To cause the heart of honor to vibrate
While man still keeps the thoughts that make man
great.

ESSEX TOURING
The largest sales of 6-cylinder
cars simply reflect the general
recognition of greatest car value.
But it is important to note how
this position of leadership gives
Essex advantages in continually
improving value to the buyer--
because of volume economy in
purchase of materials, manufac-
turing savings, and low cost of
distribution.
Built on the Super-Six principle,
the patents which account for
Hudson’s famous reliability, bril-
liant performance and long life
are responsible for the same
qualities in Essex. It is the easiest
riding and steering Essex ever
built —the finest in performance,
appearance and workmanship.
We believe it is the most economi-
cal car in the world to own and
operate. Its economy consists not
only in low first cost and operation
expense, but, more important, in
freedom from repair expense, the
low cost of repair parts when
necessary, and long car life.
Now it holds the greatest price
advantage with the finest quality
Essex ever offered.

ABORIGINALITIES

BARNES LINSEED OIL
“Ess” : These times of strikes, high wages
and 44 hours bring- back memories of my boyhood
days on a Richmond River scrub-farm. All the
farmers helped one another when necessary, but even
the most affluent of our neighbors rarely paid cash
for labor. They merely borrowed one another or
one another’s sons. Casey, for instance, worked two
days or two weeks on Flynn’s farm, and then Flynn,
when required, worked the same time for Casey.
You never heard Casey say that Flynn owed him
two days’ wages; it was always “two days’ work,”
and the days were from daylight till dark. For the
proper adjustment of accounts a boy was reckoned
half a man; a man and a horse were equal to three
CONFIDENCES.
“My good friend, I’m never ashamed of my convictions.”
“ ’Ow many 'ave y’ ’ad altogether?”
men, and a horse and cart were a whole family.
Carts were very scarce then, and families were
generally large. It was my old man’s habit of
borrowing Casey that turned me against farming.
He seldom paid Casey back with his own labor, but
put the debt on to me. Casey never hurt him-
self when he worked for us, but when I was sent
to repay him, two days for one, he kept me going
like a cyclone. My greatest ambition in those days
was to possess a horse and cart.
“Mephisto”: “J.T.D.” (B. 31/12/’25)
speaks of “fools” who plunge a wet hand into
molten lead. One might class King Edward VII as
such. Once he visited a certain steel-foundry in
England, and, being informed that one could plunge
a wet hand into molten lead without injury, he
called for some water and performed the feat. My
erudite opponent states that “the only metal known
to science that will stand this operation is quick-
silver. Why mercury should be dragged in I don’t
Know, as it is liquid at all ordinary temperatures
and would not hurt the hand of a baby immersed
for any considerable time, and does not require
a water-jacket, either. “The explosion would shatter
hand and shower the fool with hot liquid,”
J.i.D.”says. But so little water evaporates and the
temperature of the vapor is so low that if the hand
were immersed for any length of time the vapor
would simply bubble up the side of the hand, and
the hand itself would be burnt. An explosion is
impossible.
* * * *
“Q. Cliff”: Every lugger and cutter sail-
ing the waters of Torres Strait trails behind her
some ten fathoms or so of stout line to which
is attached a hook, generally baited with a piece
of red rag. It is seldom indeed that the red lure,
as it is jerked through the clear water, fails to
attract the attention of some hunger-driven “towline-
tish, or kingfish, as it is also called up here. The crew
of a lugger out from T.I. recently hooked one
which measured sft. lOin. and weighed just over
601 b. It had evidently been too slow-witted to
take a hint, for there were two old hooks, each with
a scrap of copper wire attached, hard and fast in
its mouth. The wire must have been bitten through
when the fish escaped—not a difficult nerformanee
for such powerful jaws.
“Vakatawa” (Fiji) : “Papi” (B. 5/U/'25)
suggests the existence of earthquake psychists. Per-
sonally, I have never struck a human being with the
faculty, but in Suva just before the big earthquake
in November, ’lB, every dog for miles round was
howling in a most mournful fashion. Again, a few
weeks back, there was a fairly severe ’quake and two
small ones followed it at intervals of 10 minutes.
From a few minutes before the first until the last
had passed, the towsers of the district sent up their
howls. That, combined with the earth-tremors, was
enough to “put the wind up” anyone with nerves.
* * * *
‘‘The Rumpus”: Fremantle’s rats are as
daring as Melbourne’s. Recently I went fishing on
the Mole and took up a comfortable position on
its rocky formation. After a little while I hooked
a fairly large jew-fish, and, having drawn him clear
of the water, the beggar got caught in a rock
crevice. I was about to clamber down for my prize
when the line began to play out again for some ten
feet or so, and then sagged. Instantly I caught sight
of the reason. Two large grey water-rats had
fastened fangs into the jewie and were hurrying home
with fish for 'tea. A third rodent had seen to it
that the line had been bitten through.
“Morob” : Off the
coasts of New Guinea
and neighboring islands
it is not uncommon
for ships to be visited
by large butterflies.
Some of these have a
wing-spread of 6 and
8 in., and apparently
they fly distances rang-
ing from 50 to SO
miles. It cannot be
that they are blown
out to sea, for often
they make an appear-
ance when the air is
still for miles around.
Also the undamaged
condition of their wings
shows that they have
not encountered any
disturbance of the kind.
As a rule, these insects
do not exhibit any
signs of exhaustion,
notwithstanding that
they are comparatively
slow fliers, and must
have been in the air
without rest or food
for some days at least.
I once saw a magnifi-
cent red, gold and
green specimen come
down slowly and quite
naturally on the deck
of the Melusia when
that vessel was a good
50 miles from the
nearest land, only to
vanish the same night
after a rest of several
hours.
“Parama”: On Darnley Island, Torres
Strait, the general burial practice in early days
was to place the body on a bamboo staging
erected between four cocoanut-palms in the centre
of a grove, and there leave it to rot. The staging
was not roofed, but was fenced with woven cocoanut-
leaves to hide the body from view. The people
of the village then gathered round the four trees
that held the platform and remained seated and in
silence for 24 hours. Fires were lighted at sundown,
and were kept burning brightly till dawn to hold
off the spirit of the dead man. The widow and
family of the deceased mourned loudly in the privacy
of their own hut. Next day the cocoanuts were
stripped from the grove, all dry nuts and leaves
were cleared from the ground, and the grove was
declared closed for one year, in sign of which certain
of tlie trees were girdled with split cocoanut-leaves,
and a framework of bamboo, decorated witli nuts,
leaves and flowers, w'as erected on the edge of the
grove nearest the pathway. A year later, if the

season had been a good one and the gardens were
full, the men of a village on the opposite side of the
island held a meeting, and made a night-raid on
the grove to “steal the head,” by that time a sun-
bleached skull. The whole programme was carried
out in silence when the moon was at the full.
The skull was then taken to the raiders’ village
and there made “flash,” being fitted with shell-eyes,
clay nose, and painted in designs in red clay, char-
coal and burnt coral, each ingredient being first
worked into a thin paste with eocoanut-oil. When
dry, it was further embellished with tufts of fibre,
grass and feathers. A feast was then made ready
at a spot midway between the two villages, and
the decorated skull was mounted on a stick driven in
the ground in front of the food. The people of the
other village were then called to the feast, and the
head was handed over to the widow or relatives oi
its late owner, to be taken home and added to their
collection of similar bric-il-brac hanging in the smoke
under the roof of their hut.
* * * *
“Colub” : The 15in. which “Tamornie” saw
a snake eject venom from its poison-glands (B.
17/12/’25) is nothing compared with what some are
capable of doing. At a Melbourne laboratory I saw
a black snake which was being persuaded to void
the contents of its poison-gland into a glass recep-
tacle throw some of its venom fully 10ft., the liquid
striking against a wall with a splash. In another
case a tiger-snake was seen to eject poison 7 or
8 ft. The force with which the venom is emitted
depends chiefly on whether the gland is quite filled
or not, the actual operation being controlled by a
set of muscles at each side of the poison-sac, which
is squeezed by the contraction of the muscles.
Nature has seen to it that the liquid is discharged
with force in order to make sure that it completely
enters the flesh of the victim into which it is
injected.
* * * *
“Billy Cann”: The statement that lark-
spur-seeds are poisonous (B. 24/12/’25) has cleared
up what was to us a mystery. A valuable cow
having spent an evening in the flower-garden suddenly
sickened and kicked the bucket next evening. A
post-mortem revealed nothing unusual beyond the
presence of a quantity of the flower named. I
cannot, however, support “S.C.” when he states
that the seeds of the so-called “deadly nightshade”
are poisonous and are consequently shunned by birds.
The plant has been a greater curse to me than my
creditors. The year just past brought a heavier
than ever crop of the nightshade, and just as I
began to think that the storekeeper might shift
me before I could shift the curse the starlings
came and stripped every berry off, saving me the
cost of hoeing. Not one dead bird was picked up;
on the contrary, they assumed the rotundity of
aldermen, and, on the berries being cleaned up,
gleefully took on the job of clearing the caterpillars
out of my barley adjoining. This job also they
accomplished in a workmanlike manner.*
“Wallaby”; Queer accidents? A case has
just occurred at Sea Lake (Vic.) where a sports-
man was shot in the foot—-by a rabbit. In its
death-throes bunny kicked the trigger of a loaded
pea-rifle.
* * *
"Bad Australian” : Concerning the leaping
and volplaning habits of the lyre-bird, “Polycarp”
(B. 24/12/ 25) is right, but he is in error when
he says that the bird is unable to fly. Where the
take-off is on the side
of a spur the bird after
a short run volplanes
to the bottom of the
gully or to a con-
venient spot on the
opposite spur. When
the country is level
he picks the handiest
scrubby sapling and
leaps from limb to
limb until he reaches a
jumping-off place about
20 or 30 ft. from the
ground, where he
spreads his wings to
the breeze and sails
away. But when there
is no sapling handy and
he is suddenly alarmed
or rushed by the
hunter’s dog, Superbus
Stands not on the order
of his going. He gets
up out of the bracken
or scrub like a barn-
door fowl and at 15
or 20 ft. cuts out the
lifting gear and vol-
planes for the safety
zone. Although I have
spent years under can-
vas in lyre-bird coun-
try, I never saw a nest
with a taking-off plat-
form in front, as de-
scribed by “Polycarp.”
The nest was almost
invariably built on top
of an old stump or at
the base of the fronds
of a tree-fern, either of
■which provided all the
take-off required.
According to my obser-
vation, the birds have
their nests on flat
country as well as the
sides of spurs, but the
greater number are found in the bottoms of the
gullies, where the undergrowth provides the best
shelter.
* * * *
“Two Seas" : I don’t know anything about
the virtues of ground-acorns or red-gum sap as a
cure for dysentery, but when suffering from that
affliction in a dangerous form in India I was
cuied by my old friend Skinni Dham, who, alarmed
at the prospect of losing - his best customer, appointed
himself my medical officer. His first official act
was to throw away the “damfool stuff” his white
predecessor had left at my bedside. Then he went
to the bandaddy house’ and boiled a large cliattv
of rice for some hours. When cool, he strained off
the water and gave me nothing else but it to
drink. In a few days his “cunjee pawnee” did the
trick, and I was convalescent. He sent in no
bill for professional services, but his stock of
castor oil must have shown an almost incredible
profit.
* * * *
“N.K.C.”: Referring to “J.C.’s” comments
(B. 24/12/ 25) on dairy attendants and cancer, has
the pievalence of the disease in dairying districts
been noticed ? My little bush school is in the heart
of the cow-country, and lately I sent out an appeal
on behalf of the Bendigo (Vic.) hospital, mentioning
the necessity for special apparatus in the treatment
of cancer. When funds began to come in, I found
that practically every family in the district had,
then or previously, some sufferer from this scourge.
It cannot arise from boric acid in the butter, as little
factory butter is used. As cows are known fre-
quently to have cancer, is it possible that such cases
may be due to infection from them?
* * * *
“Kino”: Red-gum (B. 31/12/’25), in the
ti eatment of dysentery, bas long been recognised
and is in the British Pharmacopoeia under the name
Kino eucalyptus. It has an official relative in kino,
an East Indian product. Both owe their value to
kino tannic acid, which is powerfully astringent.
The ordinary red-gum is a bit weaker in the acid
than its fellow, but has the advantage of more pro-
longed action. From 10 to 20 grains is a usual dose.
* * * *
“Sandy”: One morning about 5.30 during
the Christmas holidays I was fishing in the Snowy
at Mario (N.S.W.), when I witnessed a sight I
had never even heard of before. Whilst watching
the point of my rod I noticed a movement on the
bank not more than 50 feet away. A rabbit, after
hopping about a bit, dived into' the Snowy, swam
about 30 or 40 feet and then returned to the bank.
On relating the incident, I was advised to “take
more water with it” or to see an optician. I
know it to be true, and what I really wish to
learn is whether Bunny was having a morning
bath or was it his intention to get to the other
bank about 300yds. distant.

HEADER SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ripened is the harvest and burning is the sun,
Beating on llie headers where the grain-streams run;
Belts and cups are lifting, the pulleys turn apace,
And threshing through the long day the big drums
race.
The crank-shafts reel
While the drum-bars beat,
And every night is richer with its garnered store
of wheat.
Breasting through the tall straw the plodding horses
break,
And cloudy is the bees-wing that flutters in their
wake.
Spiral drives are feeding from blades that race and
run
To sickle on the wide comb the bounty of the sun.
The cut flows full
And the bronze heads fall,
While driving down the comb breasts the spirals
gather all.
A hand upon the comb-lift, a hand upon the reins,
We reap along the uplands and strip across the
plains ;
We open out the blast when the staunch teams wheel,
And praise the potent sun-song of good Australian
steel.
The cogs grip true
And the fans hum sweet.
And throbbing through the long day we gather in
the wheat.

Tk P as f° ra fi s^s > finding their ewes poor and short of milk, commence feeding just prior to lambing.
e amage is then already done, for a ewe will rob her own body during the gestation period to provide
tor the growth of her unborn lamb.
In robbing her body, she robs her fleece, thus causing loss of weight, loss of density and tender wool.
To secure the maximum results with Breeding Ewes, feeding should commence during the latter half
ot the gestation period. This ensures healthy development of the unborn lamb without drain on the
constitution of the ewe, and hence easy lambing, more lambs, low mortality among ewes and heavier
fleeces of sound wool. THEREFORE FEED NOW.
MEGGITT’S PURE LINSEED SHEEP NUTS
supply all the food needs for growth and development, for the secretion of milk in ewes and for wool growth.
To feed a ewe for two months, including freight charges, would cost less than Is. Id. An extremelv
small increase in wool and lambs would cover this cost, but as results are invariably excellent, a high
margin of profit is always obtained.
This is not theory. It has been proved in practice by hundreds of progressive graziers.
If your ewes look poor, start feeding the Sheep Nuts at once, and you will note a big difference at
lambing time.

When you use CYANOGAS for rabbit extermination, you carry
destruction right into the enemy’s lines- —to the innermost dead-
ends of their stronghold. Its fumes go wherever the warren
goes, indicating every opening bv a smoke cloud.
Apply CYANOGAS. with the Fumo Dust Blower, speeiallj

“Roma”: I was chatting to three southern
Queensland graziers when we were joined by a
fourth, and the four, whose leases adjoined and were
inside a netted ring fence, could muster 30,000 sheep
between them. The conversation turned to a trouble-
some dingo which all had been trying to trap. The
newcomer said he had had bad luck; he had
caught six or seven goannas and two foxes lately,
but always missed the dog. Thinking he was rather
fortunate in catching the foxes, I suggested he had
something, at any rate, to be thankful for. “Oh,
no,” he said. “If I get a fox in a trap and he
is not badly done up I put a bag over him and
let him go, if I can. Foxes get a few lambs at
the lambing, but I don’t grudge that, as they mop
up such a lot of kittens (rabbits) all the year
round.” On my turning to the others for corrobora-
tion, they said that whilst the goanna was the more
useful, as he took kittens and no lambs, foxes were
well worth their keep, provided they did not be-
come too numerous. What have sheep-men in the
southern States to say to that ?

“Kriz” : Attempts were made a few years
back to culture pearls at Broome (N.W.A.). t’er-
mission having been obtained from the Fisheries
Department, special beads were imported from Japan,
and several tons of treated shell was placed on the
ocean bed at Entrance Point. Soon a cry went up
that if cultured pearls were placed in competition
with the genuine article, prices would fall, and that
Broome’s genuine pearls would be looked on with
suspicion by world buyers. The majority of the
pearlers petitioned the Government to step in and
cancel the licenses. The Fisheries Department listened
and obeyed, and ordered the shell to be
taken up. The sole reminder to-day of that venture
is what is known as “Culture Cottage,” erected to
house the Japanese who looked after the shell. It
is used occasionally by honeymooning couples.
* * * *
“Weka”: Queer tragedies? At Thorpe,
near Nelson (N.Z.), on New Year’s Day, Lucy Olsen,
a "young woman of 25, was one of a picnic party from
town. A stop had been made at a farmhouse and
she got into a trap standing in an out-shed. Two
of the party in a spirit df fun grabbed the shafts
and, acting as horses, pulled the vehicle out. The
girl’s head struck against a beam over the doorway,
her neck was dislocated and she died in a few
minutes.
“Gregor” : On many parts of the east coast
of Australia continual erosion is going on; in some
places the shoreline is being eaten away at the
rate of more than a foot a year. This erosion is
most marked in the area where the Queensland-
N.S.W. border-line runs on to the coast. At more
than one spot it has been found necessary to
construct seawalls to prevent the waves from devour-
ing acres of foreshore. In the Far North the
phenomenon is pronounced ; in the Cooktown district
small indentations have become large bays, while
capes have vanished altogether during the
last 10 or 12 years. The cause is partly the action
of strong ocean currents thereabouts, and partly the
nature of the coastline. This continual eating away
has probably been going on for thousands of years,
so that centuries ago the edge of Australia must
have extended much further east than it does to-day.
“Te W.” : I first met the demure and too-
trustful English thrush, described by “Tarago” (B.
31;T2/’2's), meandering about a lantana thicket in
an old garden near Sydney some 20 years ago. It
was so tame that it allowed itself to be caught and
gently handled. Foraging tabbies find this bird —
like our unalert peaceful dove —an easy prey. Most
of the English birds, except the insolent house
sparrow and the lousy starling, have failed to mine
good when set free in Australia. Many years ago
I assisted in liberating a batch of English skylarks
on the Monaro (N.S.W.) plains. For a time the
little brown birds were seen occasionally, but never
got into full carol, and have, I think, now entirely-
disappeared. This, however, was in the days of
the native-cat, now nearly extinct through poisoned
rabbits. Our singing or mounting lark, not a
very common bird, may easily be mistaken for an
English skylark, but its vocal efforts, though har-
monious, are not sustained enough to inspire poets.
“Buttenderry” : The son of the orchardist
mentioned by “Jim Carew” (B. 24/12/’2o) who
found the whisky in the demijohn mild and mellow
and very different from what it was CO years ago
furnishes an interesting example of self-delusion.
He was positively convinced that the whisky ought
to be very much improved. Hence it was! A
more or less porous container —such as a wooden
cask—capable of absorbing fusel-oil and other im-
purities, is one of the main essentials in the maturing
of spirits. Whisky after being kept even 60 years
in an earthenware demijohn would be much the
same as when first put into it.
* * * *
“Canar”: North Queensland is the home
of a shrub, growing to a height of about 7ft.,
bearing a bright-red
flower containing a
number of minute
spines in its centre.
Around these spines
is a fine, light,
powdery yellow dust
which is easily detached
and blown about by
the wind. Should
even a small quantity
of it come into con-
tact with the human
skin it will produce a
redness not unlike
erythema, followed by
an intense itching
•which persists some-
times for several days.
In acute cases there
may even be slight
fever, with severe head-
ache, lasting for a
couple of hours. One
curious feature is that
it is only the external
skin which seems to
be affected, for appa-
rently the dust does
not attack the soft
inner surfaces of the
nose and mouth when
it is breathed in. But
animals’ eyes become
swollen and closed; a
weak solution of pot-
assium permanganate
will generally give instant relief.
“Hotliam”: The first whale captured in
the Derwent for 40 years was found in some fisher-
men’s nets at. Hobart the other day.. The method of
capture is said to be unique; but there are many
instances of grampus and “herring whales” being
caught by North Sea fishermen in the same way, and
both are bigger and stronger than the Hobart infant,
which was 12ft. long. Whales are also netted in the
regular way of business on the West Coast of Maoriland
—or were, before the war. The nets were of fencing
wire in huge sections loosely knit together. These
were set in a narrow pass used as a right of way
by passing cetaceans. When one struck the net,
he broke away from his section to be despatched by
the whalers, or drowned. The British Navy adopted
this device to catch submarines in the North Sea
and English Channel.
* * * *
“F.P.L.”: A Kanaka’s arm, hacked off
and hung to a tree on the beach, was recently
used as a practical sign of “frightful ".ess” by the
wild bushmen on Mallicolo, one of the largest islands
of the New Hebrides. The token was discovered
recently by a young planter not far from his home.
It was on this island that a well-known American
photographer had a disturbing adventure a short
time back. Having contrived a meeting at his
beach camp with the chief of the Bignambas, he
obtained some fine photos of that worthy and his
warriors. The photographer’s wife helped matters
along, as she thought, by being nice to the chief
during the short meeting of the parties. Believing
that he had found favor, the chief returned next
day with a squad of savages, naively expecting she
would go with him. Angered at her refusal, he had
the camp surrounded, and it was only by the
arrival of a ship’s landing party that an end was
put to an ugly situation.
* * * *
“C.C.”: Some old stone figures have re-
cently come to light at Murray Island. One is in
the form of a snake, another represents a rat; others
are roughly carved figures of men and women. The
old men have the following information to give
concerning the snake. In the bush at a place called
Eror it was placed on a certain spot, with trumpet,
clam and other shells to form an enclosure. It was the
guardian of that particular spot. If it was touched by
a stranger the people of the tribe became wild and
angry. Consequently, when the custodians of the
shrine saw the people in a quarrelsome mood they
knew that someone had been interfering with it, and,
taking turtle-oil, they proceeded to the spot and
anointed the snake, at the same time using incanta-
tions, which presently had the effect of quietening
everybody down. A man had to be careful not to
remove any firewood from the place where the stone
serpent kept watch. Should he do so, he would
find his house over-run with live reptiles that night.
There was also another snake zogo at a place called
Separgood, where the figure was supported by a
cordon of stone rats, lizards, etc. The members
of the fraternity kept it as a sort of watchdog, so
that if there were any trespassers it would bite
them. Also it had the power of detecting the pre-
sence of unauthorised persons by the body-smell.
When making zogo the people piffled grass, twisted
it in the form of a snake, and hung it on a tree;
if anyone walked in front of these grass snakes it
was all right, but if they were incautious enough to
pass by the tail end they were in for a run of
bad luck. The members under a zogo’s protection
had certain rigid rules to conform to. E'or instance,
no man of this zogo could eat Ash (with the exception
of one form of shell Ash, the periwinkle, which the
taboo itself also ate), otherwise the serpent would
bite them and cause sickness. Should they see a
live snake when at work or walking along the road,
they must not kill it. But should a coiled-up snake
be seen by a member of the zogo’s circle, he would
carefully place a leaf of the dayar plant (resembling
the canna) on top of the reptile; this prevented the
snake from moving—“that leaf he got medicine so
that snake he lose his sense”—and by-and-bye it
would be found dead on the same spot.
* * * ■*
“Jesmond” : It is not generally known that
yabbies can give a dangerous and painful bite. This
is not due to any toxic property of the crustacean,
but to the fact that it lives and feeds in the Alth
and decayed matter which gathers on the beds of
waterholes. 1 have heard of several cases and have
known personally two men who spent weeks in
hospital after being bitten —one almost lost his arm.
Country people should bear this in mind; and when
young hopeful admits having been nipped by this
small-boy’s joy, strict precautionary measures should
be taken.
* * * *
“Six and Eight”: What has become of
the wombats, once so numerous throughout Aus-
tralia? They are now comparatively scarce. As
they are seldom hunted, their decrease must be
due to some new conditions of life which have
arisen since the settlement of the country. It seems
that, just as imported pests are in the struggle for
existence besting our native birds and Ashes, so
the rabbit is surviving at the expense of the
wombat and other Australian fauna.
* * * *
“Jimsey”: I was once in a country town
up north when our blacktracker died. After putting
his body in a coAin the sergeant handed it over to
the tribe for burial. Meeting one of the niggers
about a week later f asked if they had buried
Tarpot. “By cripes, Boss, yes,” came the reply.
“We bin bury that pfeller all right—wrap ’im up
alonga chaff-bag and put ’im in ground. My w T ord,
boss, that pfeller box makem good boat alonga ducks.”
* * * *
“Atherton” : The padymelons were dining.
From cover I waited my chance of a shot. Up a
gully crept a red dingo, so evidently on special
business that I lowered my riffe out of curiosity.
His prickears peeped above the gully-bank; then
his body rose. Instantly the padymelons sat back,
alarmed, and several thud-thud-thuds told of the
hasty retreat of some to the scrub. The dingo
lifted a forepaw to the sky and yapped complain-
ingly. He rolled over and over, his tail thrashing
the grass, his tongue licking his paw. It was
so evident he was thinking of nothing but the
splinter in his poor foot. I noticed that each
ANOTHER BLACK MARK AGAINST
THE FORCE.
“Hey, Alum, the new cop's broke yer bottle'r
beer!"
“How did that happen?"
“Dad 'it 'ini on th ’ 'ead with it!"
roll carried him a little closer to the padymelons.
The}’ gazed with perked ears, curiosity overcoming
caution. The dingo ignored them entirely. He
drooped on his scraggy haunches, dolefully shaking
his paw like a school-kid after tasting the master’s
cane. Then with low, exasperated yaps he rolled
over again, his claws scratching gravel, his nose
buried in the ground, and so he gained another few
yards. Once more he arose, and on three legs
chased his tail in circles. Each concluded circle took
him just a little nearer the padymelons. Then
again he rolled —accidentally—towards the ’melons.
Several of them became uneasy, and, hopping to the
sheltering scrub-edge, sat back with curious brown
eyes watching this most unusual dingo. Presently
but one incautious ’melon remained in the open.
The dingo’s rolls became faster. As the 'melon
drooped his body to hop the dingo was up in a
flash, and his galloping rush caught the ’melon
even before it had attained full speed. I was left
reflecting that brains had secured an evening meal
where civilised man with a rifle went without.
NINEVEH TOWN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Jonah fared to Nineveh town
(List to an cld sea tale),
He never dreamt as his trip began
Of all the risks of the road he ran;
For he was a plain old sailorman
Used to fishin’ in the creeks of Dan,
Not in the belly of a whale.
He used to drink, as seamen do
(That is the same old tale) ;
He'd stoush his man or take his due,
He’d knock round town with Sal or Sue,
Or get shanghaied with the mates he knew,
Or shoved in clink with a glorious crew —
Hey for the belly of the whale !
He got a hint from the Gates of Gold
(So runs the quaint old tale) :
“Rise up, you stray from the Lord’s own fold,
And gird your loins, for Nineveh old
Is turned stark black to a Satan’s hold
And you must preach of the wrath unrolled—
Jonah, Prophet of the Whale!
He growled and grouched, but he went at last,
Went with a Tarshish sail,
Tried to dodge from the Powers on High,
Tried to ’scape from the Lord’s own eye,
But shipmates smelt that a shirk was nigh,
Cried “Heave-ho with the heathen spy,
Out to the belly of the whale!”
The fish he rose to his orders true
(Hr, had a nose for a trail) ;
He took the spy whom the seamen threw
Down to a bunk in his midriff blue,
And said with a smile: “There are berths for twt
A covering warm and a bite to chew
Down in the belly of the whale!”
And hour by hour and day by day,
Under the mid-sea gale,
Did Jonah sweat and Jonah pray:
“Forgive me, Lord, that I went astray;
And let Thy fish give a gulp, I say,
And land his load in a sheltered bay
Out of the belly of the whale!”
And as he pleaded it so befel.
Out of his lodging stale
Was Jonah flung; he swam for a spell,
Landed safe and ran for to tell
“Nineveh, Ninpveh ! 1.0, there’s a Hell
Waits for you, and an ending fell—-
I am the Prophet of the Whale!”
And Nineveh harked and Nineveh wept
(So runs the olden tale),
Wept for her sins till her heart was srvept
Clean and clear and her people stopt
Out o’ the slime, and her elders crept
Whisp’ring softly “The Truth has leapt.
Out o’ the bell}' of the whale! ”
And so was saved Nineveh’s soul
(Hail to the Preacher —hail!).
In quick-march time he saved her whole,
Led her sheer to the shining goal,
Bade her list where the joybells toll,
Bade her hark when the anthems roll—
Wondrous Prophet of the Whale!
But, after all, it seems to me
Out of this ancient tale,
The fish did more in the heaving sea
To turn those folk from their heathen spree,
To walk in the paths of Pietie,
And keep red Hell from a proud citie.
Here’s to the belly of the whale!

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-
Kayser
GLOVES
Of all tilt' silly sheep we grow the Rand-
wick flocks are the blue ribbonists. Just
because the countries that arc plunged up
to; the chin in ice and snow are trying to
kebp their brain-circulation from freezing
by wearing snug, cut-to-mcasure felt hats,
fh£ fair who go to Randwick are pulling
the same over their fevered brows. Last
Saturday, at the Anniversary meeting, the
small hat was as übiquitous as the jumper
suit. The meeting was one of the few un-
crowded of the year, and you got a chance
to see your neighbor from head to heel—-a
very rare thing now at Randwick, where
mostly you see a woman's head and shoulders
above the crowd, or her heels disappearing
in it. Chief Justice Knox’s lady and just-
married daughter Mrs. Poole, of Armidale,
came together; Mrs. Colin Stephen walked
in cool floral georgettes and a shady hat;
tall Mrs. Malcolm Mackcllar supported a
hat wide and velvet-trimmed: sister Una
Woolf stuck to her favorite browns. Caramel-
brown was Ruby Adams's outfit, which ran
to moh‘key-fur boundaries; and Mrs. Lach-
lan Beaton’s flowered silk had the richness
without the weight of brocade. The opulence
of'Tyrian reds was in Mrs. Prank Hewson’s
wide hat and small sunshade, and her frock
of white crepe was boldly embroidered in
black; a bronze lace frock that w r ent un-
noted by few was worn by Mrs. Godhard;
and Priminister Bruce’s lady adorned black
georgettes onf.which blooms rioted
with the effect of a Poirot cretonne.
Bong Bong opened with a bang at the
aiymal ball of the Bowral Golf Club. The
Arthur Cordeaux and Charles Maclean mat-
rons were the moving spirits, and the roll-
up at the Empire picture-theatre proved
that they had east a wide net. Here came
the summer visitor to Bowral, people who
had ‘‘epme on from Tirranna, racing men
who were up for the sport, and the glitter-
some social flappers of both sexes who follow
the crowd as the moths'the candle. Mrs.
Cordeaux, who brought a quiverful of young
daughters, dressed her efficiency in handsome
flappings of black embossed satin over which
brooded a silver rose perched on one shoulder-
strap. The creation of lame, with its front
panel of tulle, that enswathed Mrs. Charles
Maclean suggested gold lustre in excelsis.
Eueen Waley’s dream frock in mauve and
pink blac tones deserves a first place. Morna
MacCormick’s was in georgettes that shaded
from cerulean- to ocean-blue. Clarice Faith-
full Anderson and Isabel Tooth also stuck to
blues of the ethereal quality. Two garments
beyond price that demonstrated the charm of
lace were worn by Mrs. C. P. Johnson and
sister Eva McNeil; one was of white em-
bossed, and the other a nutmeg-brown web.
The artistic Phil Maclachlan wore floral
georgettes with just the right touch ; and a
centre of attraction was Elaine de Chair,
who arrived in a new fair bob and a black
lace dress that had a white rose on its
shoulder. With her came the Hordern girls
Doreen in pale lilac and Audrey in deep-blue
georgettes. Captain Coote. Captain Penfold
and two of the Ashton boys were in this
party.
Mixed weather greeted the opening day
or the meeting. It started out well, but
staggered midway into the cloudy and threat-
emng. so that woman stretched with one hand
lor her coat and with the other began an
offensive with the powder-puff against the
ravages of the cold winds. With the advance
ot a summer colony thereabouts, the picnic
idea of Long Bong retreats into the back-
srsiru*’ and even the presence of innumer-
ably tea-baskets could not dissipate the
towmtied atmosphere nor restore the spirit
of impromptu fun. v

touch. Neil McPhillamv again ba—ed the
»»,•« ><>»re of the prises, m " iSTJtin
role „n,I won the Bong Bong Cup on one $
the lucky Neil s gees. Una Clift sleuthed
Mont in beige tailorings, and W. D. Gordon
brought home the bacon again with his Re-
quest Mrs. Osborne England, one of Tir-
ranna s most hospitable hostesses, again
turned up as fresh as paint in flowered
unions and a hat that was w r ide and shady.
Mrs. F. G. White, wife of the president of
tiie club, keyed her dressing to the subdued
notes of mauve and black; and Mrs. Elwyn
1 domfield, whose husband is the club's sec-
retary, wore black at its smartest in tailored
coat and a trig hat. Mrs. Arnold Weinholt
H' viewed events in sand-colored georgettes
and millinery. Horderns, Spencer Bruntons,
Maple-Browns, Cordeaux, Osbornes and Gar-
vans were in number almost as the sands of
1 aim Beach. Commander Struben brought
ms lady over from Hillview. Mrs. Bell John-
scn of Summerlees, turned on handsome up-
holstery m two tones of terracotta, and
with her walked Mrs. Box—Nellie Melba’s
sister in black tailorings and white furs.
The second day of Bong Bong was chillier
and duller than the first, and costumes, top-
coats and small felt hats were the wear.
Flame de Chair, in cream cloth tailorings,
came under the wing of Mrs. Charles Stru-
ben, that lady being penny-brown from the
plume in her small hat. Mrs. F. G. White
being absent, Mrs. Elwyn Blomfield pre-
sented the trophies at the end of the meeting
«uiu again beckoned one of the largest parties
to her tea-table.
flie Race Club Ball was the final rocket
or the fireworks, and made a great display,
i he night being cold, an exotic shawl-garden
sprang up on the dancing-floor; all the
dancers wore outfits that were complete
strangers to one another. Of a night as
thick with beauties as a studio in Hollywood.
Marjorie Lmdeman, in a frock that suggested

Out in I ig-street, Pyrmont, where never a
fig-tree grows and life for the dwellers in
the narrow smbs of terrace houses proves
more of a thistle, a new home of the Boys'
Brigade puts up its sign. Here came the
(t.-G. last Monday to do his first official
job m Sydney; and in neat grey tailorings
and in speech that has the burr of the Ork-
neys in it lie declared the new branch opened,
ror brevity his speech was certainly an
object-lesson to president J. O. Fairfax, who
droned interminably about the Brigade root
and branch. Chieftain Birks, of the
Kotarians, Minister for Health Cann, Kelso
King (very gentle and sincere he sounded),
Consett Stephen and the Padre of Toe H
also added a wordy draught to the
beaded bowl of eloquence, and then everybody
trooped down from the big and cheerful
assembly-room on the top of the building to
the gymnasium, which is in the basement.
Ihere was a guard of honor and a bunting-
hung entrance to greet Lord Stonehaven,
while half ot the neighborhood and the Polio;'
Band had turned out to watch for his coming
and going. In the building are reading-
rooms, a library and a room equipped for
games. Already there are 83 youngsters
enrolled, and it looks as though Pyrmont is
going to take its club-house to its heart as
closely a s Surry Hills has taken the founda-
tion club. The Chief Justice Knox couple,
Kadith C Valker - Keeps, Stephens and lots
or h airfaxes were there, benevolent and be-
nign. Red Crossers, reverends and returned
soldiers, too, helped to launch the new ven-
ture on a sea of smiles.
The pretty girl in this picture is Mrs.
Ncttement, bride of the Consul-General for
Franco. Her
outs tanding
distinction is
that she does
not come to
her Consular
duties from
overseas; she
is a Sydney
girl, and be-
fore her mar-
riage was Miss
Suzanne Her-
chuelz, daugh-
ter of a well-
known wool-
broker. Her
duties in con-
nection with
the visit 'of
the French
warboat Cas-
siopee were
her official in-
troduction to the French-Australian commu-
nity.
Artistic Sydney is on the grin over the
Archibald-prize wrangle. The Society of
Artists is “protesting” because the nice fat
roll of bank-notes didn’t go to its protege—
or is it patron?—George Lambert. Mean-
time John I.ongstaff has the prize, and will
hold on to it; and there is no getting away
from ,the fact that his Moscovitcli is a strong
piece of work. It is no use bringing in the
contention that Longstaff, to fall in with
Archibald’s wishes, should have painted an
Australian; for in accordance with Arclii-
bald’s wishes the winning portrait should
also be of one who has made a success in
the artistic world, and Lambert’s subject, the
venerable G. J. Cohen, great as his successes
have been elsewhere, has never assailed Parnas-
sian heights. Nor did Mclnnes, who was re-
warded the prize so often, ever paint anybody
with a claim to a place in the art world of
Australia. Incidentally, before the award was
made, miniaturist Mrs. Montague Marks, on
her way to Melbourne from the U.S.A.,
owned to spending nearly a whole morning
before Longstaffs picture of Rose Scott. “It
dominated the court it was in,” she said. “I
know of no other portrait-painter except
Sargent who has the power to make the
personality of his sitter surge out of the
canvas.”
The truth is that nobody knows just w’hat
Archibald wanted to do. Except in a large,
general way he probably did not know him-
self. The Bulletin’s old chief, as those
who worked with him know 7, had many bril-
liant inspirations ; but it was left to others
to weigh them and, if they were workable,
to hammer out the details. How 7 much of
the weighing was done by William Macleod
and how T much of the hammering by James
Edmond, none but those two can tell.
If Professor Cooke, of the Sydney Obser-
vatory, wrnsn’t a philosopher as well as a
cl i stinguished
scientist, h e
would be a
very dis-
gruntled man.
For when lie
was lured to
Sydney from
Perth in 1912
it was on a
promise that
the observa-
tory would be
reorg anised
and re-equip-
ped. Neither
having been
done, he has
proceeded with
the work for
which the old
equipment is
suitable, care-
fully selecting
ins programme so as to dovetail into
international schemes in connection with
which contributions from Australian lati-
tudes are urgently required. The work
of charting the complete sky was started in
1892; and, though Greenwich and a few
other of the 18 co-operating observatories
have completed their sections, Professor
Cooke has still about six years’ work ahead
of him to complete the great area allotted to
Sydney. It lias been a vast business; but
when it is completed it will be completed
for all time. The Professor is a S. Aus-
tralian by birth, and was one of the most
brilliant graduates the Adelaide University
produced in its early days. Our photo by

talk in Olympus of making Lang find him
an understudy. Hugh I). Mclntosh is favor-
ably considered on account of his resemblance
to Dan Cupid, but the younger party have
a bias in favor of Town Clerk Layton.
Kathleen Elsie Ward, of Darwin (N.T.),
had two guards of honor when she was mar-
ried the other day to Surgeon-Lieutenant
Hudson, of H.M.A.S. Geranium. The offi-
cers of the Geranium formed an arch of steel
as the just-weddeds emerged from St. An-
drew’s Cathedral, where the Dean of Sydney
and the bridegroom’s father (the Rev. Dixon
Hudson, of liurstville) had polished off their
job in a workmanlike manner. And later on,
when the wedding party reached Burdckin
House, where the bride was to cut the cake
her husband’s sword, the nice-looking
V .A.D. s of the day formed an avenue of
smiles for the passing of the bride and
groom.
Rita Walshe, of Gundagai, chose St. Pat-
rick s on Church Hill for her wedding wfith
John McCabe, of Pambula. Father Carey,
of Pambula, came up to bless the vows ; and
Rita, a glimmering vision of ivory satin and
boating tulle, was squired by father and fol-
lowed by one apricot-tinted ’maid to the
altar and the waiting young man. Petty's
housed the reception, and the bride’s mother
was helped by Mrs. Cecil Manion to do the
honors.

rhe bride dressed her part in de-luxe trap-
pings of ivory shtin, tulle and orange buds
and had Doone Buckley and Mary Carlton
m attendance. Congratulations were un-
leashed at the Mary Elizabeth.
nf^m W a d a ing throbbin S interest was that
°L i. S y( jney Grammarian and international
cncketer 11. L. Hendry. He secured his best
girl, Vida Abernethy, of Rose Bay, at St.
John s, in Darlinghurst, in the presence of
vast crowds of guests and lookers-on St
John’s was prinked out with palms and white
favors for the occasion, and Fadre S Halli-
da.v tied the knot. The bride's frock’was of
ivory romaine and had a billowy overskirt of
lace. Brussels lace formed the veil, crowned
by the conventional wreath of orange blos-
som. Dorothy Walsh was the only brides-
maid, and struck a vivid note in flame geor-
gettes and silver lace, finished off by a blue
velvet and silver-tissue hat. A tiny train-
bearer in a froth of white lace and leaf-green
was also in attendance.
Sydney water-nymphs kept an eye out for
the weather last Thursday, and were rather
grumblesome that the sun did not rub itself
up a bit for the wedding of Mary Lovelace
Mary, who has been captain for some years
of the Sydney Ladies’ Swimming Club, was
keeping a date with Thomas Coghlan at St.
Matthias’s Church in Faddington, where
Fadre Newton Stephens declared all clear
and handed over their sailing papers. Vera
Pawley and Dorothy Marks followed the
bride’s ivory georgettes and Iloniton laces,
while little niece Dorothy Willington ren-
dered first aid to a train of pink rucked geor-
gette over silver tissue that looked good
enough to eat. Eric Bartley best-manned;
and the bride’s sister, Mrs. Stanley Willing-
ton, hostessed the after-proceedings at Sar-
gent’s, in Market-street.
One snake and a hostile legion of ’squitoes
made up the Girl Guides’ bag in the romantic
groves of the Maearthur Onslows’ place
beyond the demure spires of Camden. The
Guides evolved a very trim navy-blue cotton
one-piece frock for the serious business of
camp life. Tents were pegged out from an
upper x-idge sloping down to the flickering
shade of rustling gum-trees below the weir.
Lady Marjorie Dalrymple, a Scottish Guidar,
kept a keen eye on the bathers, and gave
swimming lessons to any searcher for the
right strokes; Miss Kelso King, hon. State
sec., answered a Shorter Catechism put by
non-Guide visitors; Miss Shanks, from the
braes of Caledonia, was camp comman-
dant, and the slim and tireless camp sec.,
Miss Hellicar, guided strangers through the
dimpled maze of young persons who had not
even touched the ’teeny age, being little
Brown Owls with unshingled tendrils curling
on their foreheads.
Two young men made records at Goulburn
in race week. One was Austin de Lauret,
now nearly 70 years young, who has at-
tended every Tirranna ball since he can re-
member, and has been at every Tirranna
meeting. The other was the young blood
•who, having got tired of dancing, brought his
partner into the ballroom in a sidecar and
dashed about the room as if he thought he
was at the Speedway.
Brisbane’s gaieties and tribulations:—
Gertrude McLeod is off to the Cold Country on the
Orvieto, and, in a setting of lavender and pink,
the Bush Book Club workers arose and gave her a
party at the Women’s Club. The Harry Cameron,
Challinor, Hunt and Goggs matrons were the
hostesses.
Colonel Smith and the officers of the 49th fixed
up a jazz evening at the Cravens’ home to help with
the buying of honor flags for the battalion. The
flags will be hung in the cathedral eventually.
Jean Cramond, who is to marry Captain Plane in
February, was the honored guest at Mrs. Walter
White’s party, when the decorations were in gold
and brown.
Lady Marjorie Dalrymple came over from Sydney
this week to organise the Queensland camp of the
Girl Guides at Southport. She is staying with the
Ross Munroes. Dorothy Hawthorn, Bananaland’s
district commissioner, came on the same train from
Sydney, and Girl Guides in their blue thronged the
platforms.
Mrs. Forrest has returned from Sydney to see the
opening of “The Moth of Moonin'’ film at the Winter-
garden. Meta McLean, of Fassifern, has written a
song to be sung by Lou Lambert in the prologue
of the picture, and the booking for the week’s run
of the Queensland film is entirely satisfactory. Fassi-
fern district figures in the picture.
Another victim to our distressful climate, William
Honey Austin, of Tallegalla, has passed out at 95.
Until a week or two before his death the ride from
Rosewood to Ipswich was a mere before-breakfast
canter for him. He was born in Devon and came to
Tallegalla 54 years ago.
Eddy Cahill and George Brooke threaten a visit
to Australia, and have already booked a tour through
Ireland after a call on friends and relatives in their
own country-. Before coming back here they go to
Italy.
Otto Prahl, who was here before the Big War as
an officer on the Norddeutscher Lloyd, has arrived
at Darwin with a couple of pals in a converted ship’s
lifeboat, 29ft. long, which he calls the Sampan.
They have been voyaging from Shanghai since June
7. After a typhoon they patched themselves up at
Juan Fernandez, had a rest at Manila, and ran to
Darwin in 12 days from Macassar. They haven’t
any money, but sell photos of the ship en route.
They mean to leave in about a fortnight for Thurs-
day Island, as part of a world tour. Prahl’s com-
panions are Tregendoff, ex-Russian naval man, who
fought against the Bolsheviks under Starck, and
Edward Clements, from Alabama, who fought in
the Philippines.

MISSES MONKE DOVLE
The weather, which lias been variegated
beyond the ordinary this season, has just
been giving a realistic imitation of winter,
and not only coats and furs, but warm undies
have been in favor. Sales of left-over
summer models stopped with a click in all
well-regulated emporiums, and rags of an
older vintage saw the light of day again. It
has been so cold that the full-foliaged green
trees that shade our gardens and thorough-
fares have looked unreal, and the very
flowers have seemed out of season. Even the
amber and gold of autumn would be too
cheery a setting for so chill an atmosphere.
Moonee Valley races on Saturday were so
popular that there weren’t enough racebooks
to go round —a real calamity. From a chilly
morning the day matured to sunshine tem-
pered by a fresh breeze, so that fair sports
were encouraged to come out in nice cheer-
ful dresses and hats—with prudent additions
in, the way of furs. A smartly-cut advance-
model topcoat attracted some attention. The
lawn was gay with flowerbeds, dahlias, gladi-
oli, watsonias and other blooms, hedged with
roses red and white, helping the course to
retain its claim to be “the prettiest in Vic-
toria.” Chairman and committee lunched a
number of guests, foremost being his Ex.,
who registered another popular win with
Night Patrol. Lady Stradbroke wore black
raiment with a touch of white in her mil-
linery, and daughter Helena was in apparel
of navy hue. Captain Yureichi Edahara and
officers of the Japanese training-ship Iwate
were distinguished visitors. Others were
Mayor Brunton and his lady, the latter
smartly suited in natural kasha with a dasli
of plaid and a black hat, and our good-
looking Rear-Admiral and Mrs. Hall Thomp-
son, who had navy feathers curling on a
hat of the same shade, with an appropriate
crepe-de-Chine gown. Roses culled from
chairman Allister Clark’s garden dropped
their petals on the damask ; and the combined
toast of George Rex and the Mikado made
a sort of diplomatic cocktail highly palat-
able to the foreign guests.
In the throng were Mr. and Mrs. A. V.
Kewney, she with.a brown satin hat and a
harmonising suit of tweed; Mr. and Mrs.
Harry Creswick, she in a reseda-green two-
piece, with white roses upon a white hat;
Dr. and Mrs. Brendou O’Sullivan (she was
Elsie Ferguson, of Brisbane) ; and Mrs.
Harry Bell, of Mildura. Mrs. Harry John-
son showed 'a double-breasted coat of light
brown basket-patterned tweed tailored in
man-style, and topped by a very feminine
felt hat of cyclamen hue. By way of con-
trast, Mrs. Henry Rosenthal appeared in
the new cape ensemble suit with wide sleeves
and many buttons in green and white flecked
jersey cloth, worn with a jade felt hat. Kath-
leen Rogers Thomson, Patsy Lempriere and
Margot Rosenthal were among the most-
prettily frocked of the chicks.
The arrival of the training-ship Iwate
from Nippon coinciding with the shedding of
Court mourning for the Queen-mother, Gov-
ernment House Avas able to extend to our
allies the hospitality associated with the
name of Stradbroke. Representatives of the
Navy, the Army, various societies and asso-
ciations and also some ecclesiastics were
bidden to an after-dinner function of the
sedater sort. (The younger set were given
a dance on another evening.) There was a
surprising number of unshingled heads: evi-
dently Melbourne's nicest matrons are dubi-
ous about this style of shearing. Gowns
sparkled no end in the firelight glow of the
reception-room. Cannas, in shades of orange
and red, formed the decorative scheme in the
drawing-room, and La France roses glorified
the supper-tables. The Countess was a wil-
lowy figure in dull black satin swathed and
trained in ripplings of diamente, with a
necklet of pearls and diamonds. Lady
Helena had ruby beads fringed upon begonia-
red georgette. Of the guests, besides the
officers of the Iwate, were most of Victoria’s
freshly-handled and -lettered. Mrs. Lee Neil
wore white georgette blending into liand-
painted chiffon with blossoms of pink. Mrs.
Neil Crowley, just back from London, had
upon her mauve georgette goAvn Avinged
draperies and much heavy silver-bead orna-
mentation. Artist Margaret McLean wore a
gold cord ceinture upon her Liberty’s frock
of Chinese blue, patterned in dull gold:
artist Dora Wilson, too, was there, in drap-
eries of emerald-green georgette.
Theatres were emptying their patrons when
the last good-nights were being said after
the dinner given at the Exhibition by Mayor
Brunton. The G.-G. made his debut at a
civic gathering, and State Gov. Stradbroke
said farewell to Melbourne’s fathers. The
desert spaces of the rambling building were
converted into bush with boskage from muni-
cipal gardens and parks. Lights twinkled
amid the greenery, and thousands of pink
carnations added charm to flounder, fizz and
other good fare. There was bounteous scope
for speechifying—the vice-regal welcome and
farewelling, and congratulations to the host
on his knighthood, and to Priminister Bruce
on his re-election. The reception given
General Monash, who replied to the toast of
the Army, had extra warmth on account ot
the unanimous way in which he wasn’t asked
to take part in welcomes to Soldier Allenby,
an oversight that will take a lot of explain-
ing. Lord Stradbroke made suggestions about
beautifying the Yarra and offered some
advice on the control of traffic, so that there
was quite a feast of reason as well as of
other things.
The Georgian room at the Oriental was
fragrant with La France roses, which trailed
from silver baskets over the festive horse-
shoe board to which Mayoress Brunton had
bidden the wives and daughters of aldermen
and councillors. The feast, postponed from
early in November on account of the passing
of Queen Alexandra, was the happiest of
gatherings. The hostess, who received much
congratulation upon her lately-acquirert
handle, wore a black satin gown enriched
with beading. Her wrap set the guests won-
dering why they had never thought of it
themselves —it was a much embroidered
Spanish shawl fashioned to a bolster collar,
and thus transformed into a gorgeous cape.
So nicely timed were proceedings that black
coffee was just arriving when “Cars await
was passed round, and the guests picked up
their several boxes of chocolates and went
off to finish the evening with Schubert s
melodies in “Lilac Time. ’ Among the in-
vited were the widows of three former
wearers of the robe and chain —the Swanson,
Hennessy and Weedon dames. Mrs. VV.
Cabena was a study in silver grey; Mrs. -L.
.] Davey wore black chiffon velvet, and Mrs.
J. AY. ' Ferguson’s Titian locks gleamed
against white crepe romaine and filmy lace.
This thoughtful-looking maiden is artist
Margaret McLean, back from a year’s roving
across the seas.

N’York they met artist F. R. Crozier; also
pianist Doris Madden (a niece of the
former Chief Justice), wTio has carved her-
self a niche in the musical world of America.
Crossing the Atlantic, the travellers were
shown the world’s biggest town by Cumbrae
Stewart —cathedrals and other historical
buildings by day, with theatres by night.
A performance of “Hamlet” at the old Vic.,
with Marie Ney as Ophelia, sticks in their
memories. Prices of admission ranged there
from Gd. for the gods to 2s. for the best
seats.
There were doings at. Government House
on Monday night when many of the younger
set, leavened by a few of the older, glided
over the polished vice-regal floor. His Ex.,
with Lady Stradbroke, who trailed black
satin and tulle draperies and wore diamonds,
and daughter Helena Rous, wearing a cherry-
red frock, held out welcoming hands. A floral
background, in which crimson geraniums pre-
dominated, made a brilliant foil for brief frocks
which sparkled merrily. Mrs. Russell Clarke,
in dull green lace draperies with bands of
gold and green brocade; Mrs. Robert Knox,
in a pale gold lace setting; and Mrs. Russell
Grimwade, who had field flowers embroidered
upon silver net apparel, were among the
guests. Others were the attractive Simon
Fraser widow, a dainty brunette, in pink
traced with gold; Captain Geoffrey Sageard
and his wife, she with pink roses scattered
upon black lace: the Reginald Egerton
couple; and Mrs. Harry Gullett, who wore
flowing ombre-hued georgette. Betty Shacked
suggested a Grecian urn with garlands oi
loses drooping from the shoulders ot a pink
georgette frock. Biddy Tallis had Oriental
hip drapery with huge tassels below emerald
crepe de Chine. Kathleen Ahern’s red-gold
locks harmonised with a covering ot VV wig-
wood blue, silver-beaded. A petite lass
was Miss Depledge from Westralia. Joan
Chirnside was spring-like in leaf-green
georgette and white blossoms, and Sybil
Irving was a symphony in tones ot
gold and brown. Jocelyn Purves Smith
showed silver and pearl embroideries upon
flared raiment of pink. The Tom Granthams,
the George Langdale pair, Nan Stewart and
sister Lavender, Peggy Campbell and Marie
and Vera de Bavay were to be seen. And
Flight-Lieut. Coote, of the De Chair staff,
was there from the Harbor City.
When the
six Australian
branches of
the National
Council of
Women were
affiliated under
a Federated
Council last
September
Mrs D. A.
Skene, here
pictured by
Lafayette, was
appointed the
first president.
She lias been
in the move-
ment for IS
years, and for
the last two
years was
president of
the Victorian
branch.
Though a very busy woman, having since
her husband’s death carried on his commis-
sion-agency business in the city, she is sec-
retary of the Women’s Hospital and a
worker on the Charity Organisation Society.
Over 70 women’s societies, represented by
two delegates each, work in with the N.C.W.,
and Mrs. W. J. Earle and Mrs. Skene are
the Women’s Hospital deputies.
The Women’s Automobile Club had a
special boiling of the kettle in the club-
rooms in honor of Mrs. Bell. The little
handful of Australian pluck gave the assem-
bled petrol-consumers an account of the diffi-
culties and dangers of her journey, and
daughter Marion, who was the lady’s sole
companion, had audience, too. The club's
president, Mrs. H. J. Robertson, told the in-
trepid lady how proud her sisters of the
steering-wheel were of her.
Back after 11 years’ absence in N’Yark,
Mrs. Montague Marks, known formerly in
these parts as Stella Lewis, a National Gal-
lery student under Bernard Hall and the
late Fred McCubbin. She has acquired fame
as a miniature painter, and has been admitted
to membership of the Royal Miniature
Society of England and the American
Society of Miniature Painters. With her
husband and small daughter Patricia she
is making a short call on relatives and old
friends.
Mrs. James Alston, who took over the'
reins of the Women’s Hospital from Mrs.
Arthur Hoskins recently, assembled some of
the very nicest people at Menzies’ to meet
Dr. MacEachern and his wife. Gladioli in
crimson and pink, with maple and palms,
made a rich decorative background for
society’s best evening-gowns, which still have
a tendency to sparkle. Woman’s love of
beads dies hard, and civilisation can’t kill
it. Speechifying was punctuated by the
warbling of Eileen Castles, Walter Ivirby
and Kathleen Rochfort.
The annual meeting of the Australian Red
Cross Society, at Federal Government
House, was not without its diverting
moments. Lady Stonehaven, with coat of
black-and-white floral georgette over black
satin, occupied for the first time the presi-
dent’s chair, and Lady Stradbroke, with fur
upon her black apparel, was in the offing as
head of the Victorian branch. Mrs. R. R.
S. Mackinnon,' of Sydney; sidestepped from
a demure account of recent travels to say
that the uniform for voluntary aids, which
involves heaps of skirt, natural waist-line,
and Petersham belting, is causing a slump
in recruiting. She pleaded for a one-piece
garment, easily laundered, comfortable and
becoming; and male delegates were almost
joyously sympathetic.
Dorrie Moreland, of Elwood, attended at
Christ Church. St. Kilda, the other night
in a gown of white marocain with embroidery
of crystal and diamente glimmering beneath
a veil and train of Limerick lace, to keep an
appointment with Dan Reese, of Christ-
church, who stands high in Maoriland cricket-
ing circles. Two bridesmaids heralded
autumn in frocks, muffs and tulle veils of
falling-leaf lines.
Daisies and blue hydrangeas nodded their
heads delightedly at Christ Church. South
Yarra, when Loris Marion Loader became
Mrs. Walter Druce Yencken. The bride
in tune with the latest overseas fashion’
wore a flowing white tulle veil floating over
a gown of gold brocade with a bouquet of
yellow roses. Ursula Bere in georgette of
blue, mauve and pink hues, with a harmon-
ising swathed head-piece, was the attendant
maid. Rejoicings followed at Kalaitha.
The cord that tied Caldie Katrine Jenkins
to Selwyn T. Bishop was securely knotted
by three ecclesiastics, including Bishop
Langley and the bridegroom's father. The
bride was all a-glimmer ■ with silver cloth,
pearl embroidery, filmy lace and tulle, with
a sheaf of delphiniums and gladioli in the
foreground. Cousins Gladys Foreman and
Tina Werner ’maided in glistening bead em-
broidery, based upon cyclamen and almond-
green apparel respectively and topped by
black millinery.
Little Betty Willis, the Catholic schools’
nominee in the St. Vincent’s Hospital Queeii
Competition, was given a helping hand by a
dance, with cards, at the Francatelli, the
proprietor and staff of which were active
workers for the cause. Betty’s candidature
is expected to bring £2OOO into the hospital
coffers before the voting closes, Mrs. J. Q.
Salmon and Mrs. Willis were the organisers,
A call from across the Strait:^
The Reaper has gathered throe of Hobart’s best-
liked and most useful women —Mrs. W, R. Giblin,
widow of the late Judge ; Mrs. Peter Facy 5 and Octa-
via Susman —all within a few days. Octavla Susnlaii,
though of the Jewish faith, had thrown in her lot
with the Theosophists, and oil Sunday a Very im-
pressive memorial service was held, the first of its
kind in Hobart. The central feature was a silver-
mounted oak urn bearing the inscription: “This
urn contains the ashes of Octavia Susman, cremated
at the Necropolis, Springvale, Victoria, January ii,
1926. More Light." In accordance with her wish,
her valuable collection of autographs, which includes
those of many kings and queens, will be disposed
of, and a cot in the Children’s Hospital provided
from the proceeds.
Pauline Curran, after having Prince Maximilian
Melikoff as an escort round half the globe, annexed
him for better or worse at St. David’s Cathedral with
all the pomp and circumstance available. The
last of the good-looking Curran quartette to take
the plunge, she did it iny. -white draperies agleaffl
with brilliants, her long tulle veil topped with
a diamond diadeni and carrying an ivory -bound
prayer-book instead of the usual flowers. The 300
guests were fed at the Imperial afterwards.
After living abroad for years, Mrs. Harry
Osborne has added her own and daughter
Rosemary’s name to next month's sailing-
home list. Rosemary is up to the coming-
out stage, and with her ends the expensive
education polish to which the family of three
has been subjected. Their mother, the cheery
eldest daughter of Victoria’s late Chief Jus-
tice, was voted a good sort in her early days,
and the re-opening of Currandooley will meet
witli loud social approval. Paddy, the heir,
went through Sandhurst, and saw service in
Turkey, but military discipline interfered
with his ambition to become a crack at polo.
He and his father and brother Denis are now
at the homestead. With the return of the
absentees all but one of the Madden family,
scattered for years, will meet on their native
soil.
From Miss Adelaide :
With Seaton and Kooyonga so crowded that the
lives of caddies are endangered, there’s a movement
afoot to establish golf-links at Glenelg. As a
matter of fact the seaside suburb ran the pioneer
club of the State, and most of the old-timers learnt
their game there, but the links vanished in the
dim past and Glenelg has felt injured ever since.
The Y.W.C.A. has opened luncheon-rooms for the
business girl on the cafeteria principle. Buff walls
with a hint of blue, willow-pattern china, decent
cutlery, good food and a spotless kitchen and
servery made a good impression on the opening
day.
The social calm continues, and even a Japanese
warship didn’t ruffle its surface. There was a recep-
tion on board—very strictly official as to its invita-
tions, with a sprinkling of Kt.’s and K.B.E.’s, and
there have been civic receptions and official luncheons
and dinners, and some motoring in the hills. A few
enthusiasts came back to town to watch the inter-
state tennis, and have been busy since voicing their
disappointment at Anderson’s play. For the rest it
is still dry, and hills housewives are keeping an
anxious eye on dwindling tanks and wondering if
the heat we must have will come in with a burst
just as they dry up altogether, and drive them
back to the plains.
The Free Kindergarten Union is rejoicing in its
latest gift—a block of land and the building to go
on it, in North Adelaide; the whole a memorial
to two well-known men from the women of their
family.
There died this week Mrs. M. Swan, better known
as Sister Hand. She got her training in the days
when nurses were expected to do wardsmaids’ work
in the intervals of nursing their patients (or was
it the other way about?), and was one of the first
women here to run a private hospital of her own.
To rare ability she united a fine generosity.
Frederick Bevan, one of the most popular members
of the Conservatorium staff, is bound overseas, and
has run the usual gauntlet of good-byes. Which re-
ininds me that Alice Mallon, booked by the Firm for
the Gilbert and Sullivan season, put in a good many
years of training at the Conservatorium here.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Irish Prince (7 to 2) failed in theA.J.C.
Challenge Stakes at Randwick on Saturday, but if
he and Red Gauntlet (s’s) had secured uninterrupted
runs they would very likely have fought out the
finish. There was a lot of crowding in the earl}
part of the race, and at the four-furlong post the
two favorites were last. From that point they made
up a lot of ground, but Irish Prince was shut in
again in trying to get up on the inside, and Red
Gauntlet’s efforts to concede a long start and from
27»b. to 291 b. to lightweights who had escaped
trouble, being always among the leaders, were too
much for him. In the end Quixotic (7’s) scored
nicely from King Cyllene and Red Gauntlet, with
Braehead a close fourth and Irish Prince fifth;
the time was lmin. 12Jsec. Quixotic is a four-year-
old brown gelding by Absurd—Los Vegas, a successful
combination; he belongs to P. H. Osborne, the
A.J.C. committeeman, is trained by Barney Payten
and was ridden by Easier, a very smart little
jockey. Tibbie (9 to 2) proved herself a game filly
in the Three-year-old Handicap, in which she came
again after both Kalloni (20\s) and Procession
(6’s) seemed to have her beaten; and rousing fin-
ishes were also witnessed in the Holiday Handicap,
won by Sea Risk (10’s), and the Welter, in which
Gaelic Maid (9 to 2) and Goldbeater (14’s) dead-
heated. Most of the starters in the Holiday Handi-
cap were engaged in the well-endowed Anniversary
Handicap, decided on the Tuesday. Dainty Davie
was favorite at 4 to 1, but after showing up promi-
nently for a mile he was unable to come on, Queen
Alwyne (16’s) and Moisha (10’s) being nearest at
the end to Sea Risk, whose party must have been
sorry he wasn’t in the Anniversary when they saw
bun win so meritoriously. In spite of Quixotic's
it was a bookmaker’s day.
An eleventh-hour lameness prevented The
t vk .I- 1 ’?," 1 tnkin S llis Place in the field for the
w.l.a. William Reid Stakes at Moonee Valley (Vie.)
and there were only four starters, three —The Night
I atrol, Sailing Home and Top Gallant—being im-
portations. The Governor’s horse went out at 6 to 4
on, Sailing Home, who had a 161 b. pull in the
weights, being second favorite at 9 to 2, Whittier
at fives and Top Gallant, despite his burliness, at
sevens he was backed from twenties down The
horses were together for the first furlong; then
lop Gallant led to the turn, where The Night
I atrol ran up to him. Drawing away. The Night
i atrol won by a length from Whittier, who came
with a great rush, Top Gallant being half a head
away third Sailing Home found the company a bit
too select for him. The winner, who is very hard
to beat at the Valley—he was successful in the same
race last year—was ridden by George Young, and in
covering the six furlongs in lmin. 124 sec. he estab-
Jwhcd a course rcord. Top Gallant' (Swynford—
showed great pace, and when properly
nt is going to be a tough proposition for some of
our cracks. Norman Falkiner’s imported horse Beau
tils (7 to 4) proved too good for the moderate lot
opposed to him in the Caldermcade Handicap. Benefix
. t 0.2), Some Speed (eights) and Rugbvean follow-
ing him home; and Greenstead had a further success
, en Greenie (fours), a smart filly bv
Ihe Welkin horse out of Sweet Adeline, accounted
for King Folly and Miss Waverley in the Niddrie
imnicap, galloping the four furlongs in 49sec
Greeme gave Killorn, formerly a crack jockey, his
first win as a trainer.

, ; The faithful followers of
Stumpy” Davis, the recently reinstated Queensland
jockey, had to wait for their reward. After “Stumpy”
had ridden 11 horses on four days without catching
the judge’s eye, some of them began to get dis-
couraged, but the majority stuck to him and con-
tinued to send his mounts out favorite. At his
ride, at Albion Park, “Stumpy” brought home
the bacon; and he rode a second winner later in
the afternoon, both being favorites. One of
them was Serella, an aged Seremond-Glenella mare,
who had had four races since Christinas for an
unplaced run and three close seconds. Serella gained
another victory in the Q.T.C.’s Foundation Handicap
on Saturday, but this time O’Connor had the mount.

“Bris”: “The betting-ring” is merely a
metaphorical expression on most racecourses, but
the "ring ’ is an actuality in the Leger reserve at
Albion Park, Brisbane. The bookmakers’ stands
aie arranged in a large hollow circle, and punters
wander about inside the ring until they get so giddy
that they mistake the bookies’ prices for fair odds.
Leger prices are usually a point or two below
paddock prices, and the latter are a point or two
(or sometimes many points) below tote odds.

“E.G.” : The Anniversary Day regatta on
by uney Harbor reminds one of the days when rowing-
races were held over a course from the Nelson buoy
m Farm Cove around Goat Island and back—they
now run from Bradley’s Head to Careening Cove.
Senior fours until 1884 rowed round Pinch-
gut and Goat Island, miles, with two
5l:”' ns ; - , ,iven the juniors started and finished at
the Nelson buoy, only half a mile shorter. And
sometimes the steamer Namoi or Newcastle, making
for Broken Bay, would meet the unfortunate oarsmen
off Bawes Point; her wash was disastrous to a
racmg-gig. Competitors in those days included H.
H. Massie, C. W. Gaden, J. A. Brodie, J. C. Watson
(afterwards Prime Minister), A. C. Ilollingworth
(asst.-sec. of the A.M.P.) and N. J. McDonald The
all-comers’ sculiing-race in 1884 brought together
such giants as Bill Beach and Edward Trickett.
Triekett won handsomely.
The speed-boat Century Tire made her
Sydney debut at Rose Bay on Saturday, when she
met the former Australasian champion, Miss Aussie
11., in a match race. While she didn’t attain the
almost fabulous speeds credited to her in America,
*j 01 . e .', en the 75 m.p.h. touched at Brisbane and
Adelaide, the invader proved too fast for her oppo-
nent, though Hope Bartlett at the helm of the latter
put up as good a fight as he does with his big
Sunbeam at Maroubra. Rupert Head, in charge of
the American, had 450 b.p. at bis disposal—one of
the Liberty motors, in fact—and he didn t have to
use all of it to win. Bartlett could have won the
second heat had he liked, as Century Tire broke a
pressure gauge and wasn’t rea.lv when the gun
went, but he preferred to contest the race like a
sportsman.

Moss Christie had to fight every inch of
the way to defeat Frank Doyle in the race for the
220 yards N.S.W. swimming championship. The
older youth won by two yards in 2min. 30 4-5 sec.—
7sec. worse than Charlton’s Australian \
promising youngster in A. Cotter, from Balmain,
collected the 100 yards junior title in 60 2-5 sec.;
Jack Doyle, Frank’s brother, was second.

S UGG: “Losing much?”

Harry Collins (lOst. 9ilb.) has never
fought with more skill and fury than he showed
at the Sydney Stadium on Saturday against Frisco
McGale (lOst. 81b.), a threatening black cloud
from the other side of the Pacific. The coon, whose
elongated chin, blubber lips and high cheek-bones
are distinctly reminiscent of “Starlight,” rushed the
white man at the first box-on bell and, with sweeping
rights and over-hooked lefts, sought to overwhelm
him. It was plain that he had been told by Sullivan,
his second, that Collins is a nervous beginner, but
when he failed to pierce the champion’s superb
defence, and merely wasted a tremendous lot of
energy, despair entered his soul. A good many
people appeared to think that he w'as punishing
Collins; they failed to see, or to appreciate if
they did, the wonderful blocking that nullified every
blow that wasn’t ducked or head-moved. McGale
just won the second round by foiling Collins’s
disastrous left hooks and countering with his right;
but the rest was all Collins, though Harry smilingly
took a lot of what appeared heavy rights to the
jaw. An exciting rally in the third bout was
McGale’s last bid for the lead, though he fought
in flashes till the eighth. Collins never left him
for one moment, his right uppercuts pounding
’Frisco's thick lips to jelly, and his hooks entirely
closing the right eye. The eighth was the last, as
far as McGale was. concerned. He went down before
a fusillade of books and jolts, turned on his face
and waited for the “out.” But the perfidious bell
rang at “three” and he was carried to his corner.
In spite of his weary protests, he was cruelly sent
up to be battered stupid for nearly two more rounds,
referee Wallis intervening just before the close of
the tenth, when the thing had become a massacre.
* * * «
‘'Sunny” Jim Williams made his bow to Mel-
bourne Stadium habitues on Saturday night, when he
met Alt Stewart and knocked him out in the ninth
round. Stewart is on the down-grade, and although he
outboxed Williams in the early hurries, showed he was
not the iron man of yore. Too much clinching, to
which Williams especially was an addict, marred the
contest, and few were sorry when the finish was
written to it. Stewart weighed list. 81b. and
Williams list. s^lb.

The Japanese training-ship at present visit-
ing Melbourne turned out a sturdy team of youngsters
to meet Victoria at baseball on Saturday. The ball-
game is Nippon’s national pastime, and a week
is alleged to be paid to famous American coaches to
instruct her in the art. The boys, possibly on
account of their youth, put up a poor showing, being
beaten by the home team by 30 to 3 ; but they played
as solemnly and keenly as they fight. One thing
stuck out. They don t seem to be quite the small men
they used to be. More meat in their rice-bowls and
chairs instead of the floor to squat on are claimed
to be slowly increasing the national stature.

An army of white-trousered and -skirted
contestants from the country has been playing tennis
for 10 strenuous days at Sydney’s White City courts.
On Saturday, the concluding day, a hard-fought
battle for the final of the men’s singles, saw
the second set go to 15 —l3 in favor of A.
Sieler. The Goulburn crack played so manfully
after the score had gone to 5—3 against him that
ultimate victory over P. lialms, the Davis Cupper,
looked probable, although the habitual champion
from West Wyalong had won the first set 6—2. In the
third, however the strain told on the Goulburn
player, and Ralms, winning 6—2, retained the
title. Mrs. Martin (Goulburn) also retained the
women’s title, and she and Sieler were expected to
hold the mixed-doubles trophies, but owing to an
unfortunate misunderstanding as to the starting-
time, they withdrew from the semi-finals. The final
went to R. Spencer and Miss Wilson. The doubles
championship was secured by Kalms and Sieler after
a hot fight with L. Baker and J. O’Rvan, 6 —4,
6—B, 6—-4. Ban-aba, which has a strong com-
bination in the brothers Spencer and Williams,
provided the champion team among the men, and
Tamworth among the girls; there were a hundred
teams altogether. Press photographers were on the
prowl, as usual, and the latest styles in tennis
stockings and bloomers are no particular mystery,
even to the readers of an immensely respectable morn-
ing paper.

Flio folly of picking 12 members of the team

illustrated in the N.S.W.-Vic. match on the Sydney
Cricket Ground Victoria batted first on a perfect

Victoria (290) was in a hopeless position at the
end of the second day, N.S.W. having 372 on th'>
board with seven wickets in hand. During the
intervals the crowd amused itself by speculating how
Collins, Bardsley, Ryder, Hendry, Ponsford, Oldfield
Macartney, Taylor, Gregory, Andrews and Mailey of
Grimmett would get on opposed to the two Rich-
ardsons, Rymill, Kelleway, Kippax, Rock, Everett

tunately, perhaps, far the tourists, such matches are
barred.
“Past Grammar’: Hornibrook seems to
have returned to his style of some years ago in the
Queensland v. S. Aus. match at Brisbane. The tall
left-hander took four S. Aus. wickets for 61 and
w:rs mainly responsible fur the visitors being dis-
missed for 198, of which the ever-reliable Vic. Rich-
in, n made 71 ; the Queenslanders replied with
1»3, R. Oxenham, who had taken 2 wickets for 29,
contributing 65. A fine natural bowler, with good
command of spin, length and variation, Hornibrook
was unfortunately persuaded, a couple of seasons ago,

v\hat they were in “W.G.’s” prime: length, accelerated

senooikid forgets all else in trying to swing the new
Dan, and the chances are that when he comes to
his senses his bowling is a vanished quantity.

‘‘Wink’: Of the 35 Test matches that
Australia has seen since Bob Crockett (B. 21/l/’26)
f ''. sx to fli P Pebbles from one hand to the
other Bob has umpired in 32. Only once was he de-
liberately passed over; on the other occasions the
Juck ot the ballot went against him. Bob has kept
an end in every Test played in Melbourne and
Adelaide since 1895. His mentor was Jim Phillips
Australia s greatest umpire of the past generation,
whose firm hand put down chucking in England
m the days of Mold. Though Crockett’s decisions
have seldom been questioned, his signal that gave
the well-set Hill run-out when Australia was hard-
pushed for runs in a Test at Sydnev in 1902 caused
a small not. The crowd was so angry that play
was impossible for some time; and after the match
Crockett had to be guarded by detectives. His
reputation did not suffer, however, for those in a
position to see declared Hill out. “Plum” Warner
in lus Life, says Crockett is the best umpire he
has ever seen. 1

Light Horse ; Reference to cricket with
one eye on the clock (B. 21/l/’26) recalls an
experience on the Palestine front—back area It
was after a match at Rafa, and an elderlv English
dug-out, who had failed in the game that dav, told
us oyer the wineeups of his triumphs in his English
public-school days. His side was playing* on another
school s ground, where it was the custom to ring
the school bell promptly at “stumps,” thus cutting
the game short. A hundred had to be made in 20
minutes, more or less, and our friend had to do
it. A succession of sixes and fours came from his
bat till, with the hand of the clock almost on
stumps, ’ there was one ball of the over to go,
and six runs to win. We sat dumb and frozen,
waiting as our hero told of the last ball. Running
half-way down the pitch to meet it, he put every
ounce into a tremendous drive —“and what do you
think happened?” There was a moment’s silence, but
before the storyteller could carry on, a tired voice
broke it; “Why, th’ blanky bell rang, I s’pose.”
Maroubra’s possibilities as a cycling track
were investigated on Saturday by a board of inquiry
that included several of the nimblest-legged lads
around Sydney. The Speedway having been con-
structed to accommodate vehicles moving at from
one to two miles per minute, it is banked to an
extent that gives a cyclist the feeling of riding on
the slanting 1 roof of a cathedral, and motor-pacing
had to be used to make riding safe. A State record
for one lap (five-sixths of a mile) was chalked up by
J. King, a Bananalander, who stuck to a motor-cycle
moving at just a shade under 52 m.p.h. The racing
was not quite as rapid as that, the fastest lap
being covered by R. Sands in the first heat at the
rate of about 46 m.p.h. Sands won the final at a
more sedate pace, but there was quite a ding-dong
go at the finish. With some practice at following
motor pace, and the better adjustment of pacing
motors to the requirements of followers, speeds of
60 m.p.h. and upwards mav be attained.

"Hast Grammar ': It is barely a year since
the Spanish Bullfighters’ Union, or its equivalent,
petitioned the Spanish Government to prohibit
the brutal sport of Rugby football, which w r as
fast invading Spain’s one-time national pastime, and
playing the devil with “gates.” Since then a lot
of the bullrings have been converted into football
grounds, and the matador and the bandolero have
given place in popular esteem to the scrum-half and
the flying winger. The game has become - such a
craze that the Governor of the San Sebastian pro-
vince has devised a special set of fines to meet
its emergencies. If there is “insulting behavior”
the home club must part with 1000 pesetas, the
referee being- also hit up for 500 and the players
for 250 each. Barrackers are not forgotten, “stone-
throwers” being liable to the calabosa without the
option, while an escort of police is to guard all
travelling teams. Altogether, the conditions resemble
those attending on the semi-finals of the Victorian
Football League.

“G.0.F5.” : The first. Melbourne footballer
to follow the cash this year is Jim Atkinson, Fitz-
roy’s captain, who has signed up with Lefroy
(Tas.) at £l2 a week. Unlike most coaches, who
alternate six months’ luxury with half a year’s toil,
Jim’s salary will be payable from New Year’s Day
to Hogmanay, for in the summer he will teach the
Tassies a few things about cricket. At football
“Snowy” is a safe and spectacular defender, with a
steady job in the inter-State eighteen. His cricket
is also first-class, though his brilliant work in the
field and some fine scores he has slogged up for
the Shield XI haven’t affected the permanence of
the slow old buffers on the side. “Snowy” is really
the best all-rounder Victoria possesses just now,
and his migration will be some recompense to the
Speck for the many fine athletes Melbourne has
stolen from it.

The Particular Value of
•$ ENO’S-FRUTT SALT- &
and its superiority over all other preparations lie in its natural
action, its fresh, invigorating, pleasant taste, and in the fact
that ENO assists Nature without supplanting her methods.
As a safeguard against those digestive ailments which often beset
us —as a blood purifier —as a gentle corrective for liver troubles as
an aid to those who are subject to rheumatism or gout as a
refreshing thirst-quencher—ENO’s “ Fruit Salt ” is unequalled.
All who value health and internal cleanliness should drink ENO -
just a small teaspoonful effervescing in a glass of water first
thing every morning.
ENO’s “ Fruit Salt ” is pure, highly concentrated, most pleasant in taste, and entirely
free from purgative mineral salts, sugar or artificial flavouring ENO does not form
an undesirable habit, but can be taken at any time with perfect safety by young and old*

THE INKY WAY.
Tom Clarke, one of Northcliffe’s proteges who left
the job of news editor of London Daily’ Mail to
become assistant editor of Melbourne Herald is
returning to Fogtown to take the job of manaeine-
editor of the Daily News. s g
Made its debut in Sydney last month, the Amateur
Entertainer, a little monthly that wants to cultivate
amateur stagecraft and secure for the non-professional
stage a higher public regard. It can be had for
sixpence, and A. D. Roberts is the editor.
H. G. Adam, assistant editor, will occupy the
Melbourne Herald’s editorial chair while Keith Mur-
doch goes on a visit to the Cold Country for several
months. As reporter, special article and leader
writer, Adam trained on the Age before crossing
over to the Flinders-street concern.
“L. Ree” : Don’t know about the origin of “wowser,”
but a late S.A. Minister of the Crown once defined
the species as “a man who wears out the knees of
his pants praying in broad daylight to be forgiven
for having worn out the other side of ’em by back-
sliding in the dark.” This may meet “Country
Ped.’s” request in a recent Bulletin for a definition
that would appeal to kiddies.
A. H. Angel, the new chief of Vie. Hansard
Staff, was formerly an Argus man. He left the
Maekinnon daily 17 years ago to record Parliamentary
debates. One night when Downward, Minister for
Lands, who is 78, was speaking of his intentions for
the future in regard to settlement, a youthful member
of the Labor Opposition pointed to Angel, and,
quoting from O. W. Holmes, said in an Irish whisper:
“The angel took a sapphire pen,
And wrote in rainbow dew,
‘The man would be a boy again.’ ”
“The Rumpus”; The slang term “guernsey,” as
interpreted by a visiting London Punch writer to
“S.T.S.” (B. 24/12/’25), is correct, but the latter
has not quite gripped its inwardness. Signifying
at first a broad hint to proceed, it has become an
invitation. It is used mostly in the form of a
question among men working in gangs, when one
member is a “pointer.” From the gentle inquiry
“Ain’t yer playin’ this game?” it was only a
natural step to the keener “Ain’t yer gotter guern-
sey?”
“Miro”: The habit of looking for a substitute to
take the blame and the punishment isn’t entirely
confined to Chinamen. A junior book-keeper on
the staff of a M.L. paper that was frequently in
trouble was informed one day, much to his surprise,
that he was to be promoted and his salary was to be
raised considerably. He offered no objections till he
was told that his rating in future would be that of
“publisher.” As two recent occupants of the position
had left the office for the lock-up, the youthful quill-
driver decided to look for another job.
“Seebee”: Rumor is persistent in Melbourne that
a morning paper intends to publish an evening sheet
in opposition to the Herald in August, and it is
further asserted that the Standard is to be the name
of it. It is difficult to believe that a name associated
with failure would be revived. The Evening
Standard ran from 1889 to 1894 and then amalgam-
ated with the ’Erald, and for a time the survivor
•was called the Herald-Standard. The latter half
of the name isn’t flourished nowadays; but there
might be objections if a newcomer sought to annex it.
“Major Honeybutter”: When Beverley Nichols, the
man who did the actual writing of .Melba’s “Life,”
was in Australia with the Dame, he accompanied
her on a visit to Norman Lindsay at Springwood.
Norman took to him mightily, especially as Beverley
happened to be a friend of Aldous Huxley; and it
is said that the Diva had hard work to hide chagrin
on account of the artist’s unconscious neglect of
herself in favor of her secretary. It was upon this
occasion that Melba ruffled up “N.L.’s” hair, saying,
“You have such a good forehead; why do you
hide it?”
“Eureka” : The monthly publication issued by the
N.S.W. Railway Commissioners under the name of
the Staff has suffered some queer changes. Origin-
ally it was the Railway Budget, an independent
monthly that freely criticised the heads when it
reckoned they deserved- it. Then the Commissioners
made the Railway Institute a branch of the service,
appointed an expensive director and changed the
name of the Budget to the semi-official Railway and
Tramway Magazine. Later it was changed to the
Staff, an entirely official publication, largely devoted
to criticising everyone who has the temerity to
criticise the administration.
“Linklater”; On May 27, 1886. to commemorate
the visit of the Premier and Treasurer of the period,
the Chronicle, of Normanton (Q.), printed an issue
on satin; my copy, after 39 years, still retains its
original sheen, and the letterpress is perfectly
clean. Among the contents is a welcome to the
Bishop of Carpentaria, as under:—
“Accept, my Lord, our kindest greeting
On this our second time of meeting;
Long may you live to come again,
And never bless your flock in vain;
While we leave no honor wanting
That we can pay Lord Bishop Stanton.”
“Lao-dah”: Christchurch Sun continues its en-
deavor to develop a literature in Maoriland. Its
annual competition this year elicited replies from
200 story-writers and 172 poets, including one
from Niue Island. Amidst the deluge were enough
good yarns to make an entertaining Christinas
number. The verses were particularly good. Yet
the majority of newspaper editors in the Shivery
Islands, grasping a paste-pot in one hand and a
pair of scissors firmly' in the other, still maintain
that they are compelled, through the absence of
native talent, to fill their columns with steals from
English papers or the syndicated wisdom of Dr,
Crane.
“Uramao”: John J. Utting spent 16 strenuous
years on M.L. newspapers before he hopped the pond
in 1881. After being a reporter in Auckland he
joiued_the now long-dead Otago Guardian in Dunedin
in 1873 and stirred public feeling against imprison-
ment for debt, incidentally exposing a case in Dunedin
where a man had been kept in prison by the Registrar
of the Supreme Court till his existence was well-
nigh forgotten. Utting also took part in making
the longest known report of a meeting ever published
in M.L. There was a banquet to James Macandrevs
(Superintendent of Otago) in 1875 which was made
the occasion of a protest against the abolition of
the provinces. The report comprised 30,000 words. The
other reporters were F. J. Davis, J. Black, M.
Donnelly and James Mitchell. Mitchell, who lives
at Oamaru, is sole survivor of that valiant staff.
“J.E.C.”: The Adelaide co. which lost £20,000
in 20 months on the Hobart News (closed down
on Christmas Eve) has purchased the Perth Daiia’
News from A. Lovekin, M.L.C., and some of the
Hobart staff, including editor Geoff Burgoyne, are
to go across. Meanwhile the Adelaide, Broken Hill
and Port Pirie papers of the same eo. are forging
ahead. Hobart Critic, which closed down on the
opening of the News, has been resuscitated since
the latter’s funeral. While the Mercury is one ot
Hobart’s goldmines, every sheet that has arisen in
opposition has come to grief, including Tasmania*
News, Clipper, Daily Post, Sportsman, the Land,
World and now the News. With a population ot
15,000 less than Hobart’s 50,000, Launceston has
maintained two dailies for well over a quarter ot
a century; but one looks like going out in tne
prevailing slump.
“Tenakolie”: John Norton never invented the word
“wowser” (B. 12/12/’25), though he certainly wrote
a screaming lender to claim the credit therefor.
sub-editor of Truth many years ago, I was handca
an article by W. C. Donnelly, a young bush journals
whom Norton had picked up during one ot t»-
tours, in which the word was used. Having nev
seen it before, I asked its meaning and denvatiout

It was Grown In Australia
An insignificant thing in itself—an ear of barley—but
there were millions more just like it. It and the rest kept
a small army of farmers and farm workers, carters and railway men
busy attending to its cultivation and harvest It helped to provide
their means of livelihood—to make them self-supporting citizens.
It was Distilled in Australia
It cattle to the largest Malt Distillery in the world. It went through the
most modern processes of distillation under the constant supervision of
exise officers keen on maintaining the standard set by the Common-
wealth as the highest in the world. As distilled malt whisky it went into seclusion
in wood to mature for more than five years. It kept busy another small army of
chemists, distillers, blenders, bottlers, coopers, carters, hotel and grocery employees.
It Increased Australia’s Wealth
It was such &ood barley that it could have &one to Scotland to be
made into whisky there if there had not been so much demand for Australian spirits.
But it stayed here for preference, and pointed the way for other ears of barley,
millions and millions of them, to stay in Australia and increase Australia’s wealth.
It added to the prosperity of farmers and farm laborers, and carters and railway men,
and distillers and coopers, and hotel employees and the rest of that vast army of
Australians whose welfare depends on the advancement of both primary and
manufacturing industries.

The company at the Sydney Royal puts,
away the glad rags and fine manners of
“Monsieur Beaucaire” after to-morrow
night’s performance; on Saturday “The Peli-
can” will fly onto the stage. The queer
title is derived from the alleged maternal
devotion of the ungainly bird for its offspring,
which causes it, in order to protect them,
to lacerate its own bosom ; the vulgar rhyme
which is the limit of most people’s natural-
history knowledge about the bird has no bear-
ing upon the play.

A rich compliment handed to Susan Rich-
mond during one of last week’s performances
at Sydney Palace was a gurgling whisper in
a girlish voice: “Oh, isn’t she like Auntie!”
Many other people who have aunties, whose
old-maidish peculiarities wrap themselves
about worthy qualities, will recognise a
family portrait in the clever sketch of Thirza
Tapper, one of the brightest of several good
character-studies which keep “The Parmer’s
Wife” going.

The principle of “Give and Take” (the
public gives its coin at the door, and takes
away a memory of full value in laughter)
is now well established at the Sydney Cri-
terion.

The Tivoli’s Old Time Minstrels failed to
put in their appearance in Sydney last
Saturday according to schedule, the demand
of Melbourne to see more of them being* the
explanation; their arrival is due for next
Monday. To make up for .the disappoint-
ment, the lively Lily Morris added to her
programme, without leaving out of it any
of the old pepper. Reeder and Armstrong
are newcomers who operate on two baby
grands, making the infants squeal very musi-
cally ; theirs is a quick, clever act, although
it would be necessary to learn the American
language to understand all they have to say.
The Seven Hollanders in their tumbling
act maintain their liveliness, which sounds
all the livelier for the shrieks of the one
female of the troupe. Leo Darnton, alleged
to be a Cambridge 8.A., but no worse for
that, does some very nice singing. This
Showman has not hea-d “A Wandering
Minstrel I” better sung for ages.
Passable vaudeville, without any items
calling for loud cheers, took possession of
Fuller’s Theatre in Sydney last Saturday.
The greatest laugh provoker was the plump
humor of June Mills, who puts so much
acrobatic energy into her business and adds
so much cheerfulness that the audience is
always infected. The Carthy Brothers work
hard with, very ancient jokes, and are mod-
erately successful; and Leslie Elliott, a girl
whose stage pet is a piano, inspires an occa-
sional desire .to make some nice remarks, but
is little better than dreary at times. Her
explanation of how she “might learn to love
him by and bye”—the him being 85 years
old—is her best. On Saturday Jim Gerald’s
revue co. will make a reappearance, and
some Old Nigger Minstrels, who include Lily
Burnand, original singer of “Two Little Girls
in Blue,” and Arthur Slater, old-time com-
edian, who used to run a popular songbook
of his own, will waken memories.

The American love for titled characters in
its film fiction, as imnrobable when they
are heroic as when they are mere carica-
tures, is displayed in “Eve’s Secret.” in
which good acting by Jack Holt, Betty
Compson and Lionel Belmore fails to carry
conviction. If the improbably chivalrous
Duke had been killed in the duel in which
he wastes a bullet, rather than send it into
the breast of the waster he supposes to be
beloved by Eve, the play might have been
better; but the film people know that their
public wants happy endings. “When the
Poor Opened” supports this picture at
Hoyt’s (Sydney). The Lyceum is screen-
ing “Wild Horse Mesa,” a Zane Grey pic-
ture, _ the release of which in Australia
coincides with the arrival in Maoriland of the
author, who proposes to put in many months
in Australia. “Searamouche” continues at
the Prince Edward.

Supplying the Home Entertainment:—
Last week the opening of “His Master’s Voice”
record-factory at Alexandria (Sydney) made another
step towards supplying by Australian labor the
home entertainment for Australia’s spare hours. Of
course the original records —or most of them—will
still have to be made where the Tetrazzinis and
Gogorzas and Giglis and Destinns happen to be;
but this factory, with a capacity for pressing between
nine and ten million copies per annum, will do all
the work it is possible to do locally. Already 140
work-people, some of them experts under whom the
rest are showing the usual Australian adaptability
for a new job, are employed ; a much bigger saving
in wages which formerly had to be sent overseas will
come when the people of the Commonwealth show
their appreciation of the “Made in Australia” stamp
on their records; besides that, they will have a
Very practical benefit to appreciate, as the Customs
duty paid on imported records will not have to be
collected from the purchasers of these. Premier
Lang gave the new' enterprise his blessing; and in
the happiness of the occasion nobody felt inclined to
raise any loud objection to his claim that the
opening of the factory showed that the 4 4-hour week
was doing no harm to industry. Among the earliest
records produced are speeches made by King and
Queen and Prince of Wales; incidentally, you get a
truer idea of the Queen’s voice from these records
than you do of either of the others.

The pace has slackened somewhat at Mel-

his jins to do his bidding on every evening
and Wednesday and Saturday afternoons

and girl who could not be accommodated last
Saturday, however, that he had to come on
duty again on Monday.
As far as dramaturgy is concerned, “Kan-
garoo Flat, ’ by Tal Ordell, is not an over-
whelming masterpiece ; but it produces plenty
of spontaneous loud laughs. For this reason
it continues to attract the shillings and the
sheilas to Melbourne Athenamm.

Judy show, plus som‘<f modern additions in

being kindly shown by the Commonwealth
Government in a well-executed filming of the
hop industry 7 on the irrigated area of the
Ovens River. Buck Jones, one of those pic-
turesque Turpins who don’t wear protective
coloring even when they are wanted by the
police, is doing stirring things in “Durand
of the Bad Lands.” It is interesting to
note that the country 7 which supplied the
world with its penny-dreadful literature 30
years ago. now supplies the same goods in
moving pictures. In our well-spent youth
we used to buy Deadwood Dicks at the
corner shop and assimilate them in the coal-
shed. The modern small boy sits with pa
and ma in Stygian darkness on Saturday
afternoons and watches Buck Jones do it.

There is showing in Melbourne this week
a few thousand feet of a film which is worth
the attention of students. “Reveille” is its
title, Betty Balfour its star and the Majestic
its present habitat. It ii a war picture and
a British production, two drawbacks diffi-
cult to live down these days. Betty is a
war-time flapper, whom the hero, a common
soldier home on leave, takes for an evening
stroll into the country. Having lost her
virginity Betty does not rush home weeping
bitterly to put on a black dress; she con-
tinues inexplicably happy. The baby arrives
after the last shell before the Armistice has
killed her lover. Recruiting orators don’t
seek out jobless.ex-soldiers in the doss-houses
after the fight is over and post-war London
has no time for unmarried mothers; but
Betty refuses to be downhearted. She even
inspires half-Bolshevised Tommies on the dole
with hope of a better world to come. The
better world is to be the work of the
children. The cynic, contemplating how the
present generation is being prepared by
kindergarten, press and pulpit for another
Armageddon, may here find matter for a
snigger; but there is no doubt about the
artistry of most of the picture. The studies
of Loudon muddle-headedly at war, with
searchlights, like her hair on end, rearing
into the sky; soldiers picking up prostitutes
in the streets; ruin and misery in some
homes and unexpected luxury in others; and
tite and comedy still bursting raw through
everything—here you have Hogarth etch-
ings over again in celluloid. Also the fun
ripples off the screen into the spectatorium
m a manner remarkable to listen to. “Excuse
Me is the supporting film. The Prince of
Wales saw it. He said it was a jolly good
picture. This page reserves the right of a
democrat to differ.

The Williamsonian crowd at the Garden
Theatre, in Adelaide, already strong on the
musical side, has added to the bill Count
Filippini and others of his recent Grand
Opera co.; but naturally light humor is the
backbone of the pleasant open-air show. De
I.age and her fiddle give an artistic turn at
the Majestic, where also Maud Courtney and
partner are as popular as ever, and Keith
Wilbur imitates anything from a five-instru-
ment band downwards. Another clever
mimic, calling himself Imito, is on the stage
a<- West’s, whose screen has the most strik-
ing picture of the week, “Don Q” ; the fact
that Douglas Fairbanks introduces stockwhip
feats into the Spanish-nobleman part doesn’t
worry Australian audiences a bit. Wonder-
graph shows the underworld of Paris in
“The Red Lily.” the York is just as emphati-
cally New York for the moment, and Jackie
Coogan is having a second innings at the
Pav. in his Hebrew-Irish “Rag Man” part-
nership.
“M.H.”; Apropos of Barrie’s “Walker,
London” (B. 21/l/’25), a paragraph of the
time, referring to his activities in 1892, stated
that he was then hard at work upon a comic
opera for Sullivan, “who has become tired
of W. S. Gilbert’s topsy-turvydom.” Did
Barrie finish the work, or burn, it, or what?
“X.N.0.”: Why is it that non-seafaring
people when they come to deal with nautical
matters will not ask for advice or sugges-
tions from the initiated? The latest offender
writer of the titles of the excellent
“Know 7 Your Own Country” series. Dealing
vfith the trawler industry the title “Swinging
the Lead” is flashed on the screen, and I
expected to see a photograph of a leadsman
in the “chains.” What we were shown was
a picture of the first half of the operation
of taking a deep-sea sounding with a Sir
William Thompson’s patent sounding
machine. The operation is not and never
has been known as “heaving the lead,” much
less “swinging” it, the latter expression be-

ing (1) applicable only to a very small
fraction of the whole operation of hand-
sounding, and (2) synonymous with “loafing.”
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : A curious feature
about “Juno and the Paycock,” recently pro-
duced at the Royalty, is that at the Abbey
Theatre it was played as a tragedy, whereas
in the London advertisements it is described
as a comedy. There is agreement among the
connoisseurs that it is a daring combination
of both, a- reconciliation which only a great
artist could achieve. The praise bestowed on
Sara Allgood, Maire O’Neil, Arthur Sinclair,
Sydney Morgan and the other principals has
been quite remarkable. On the first night
Denis Eadie, the lessee of the Royalty
Theatre, made a speech of thanks in which
he lavished the most ardent eulogy on the
cast, especially “that gi’eat actress Sara All-
good.” The artists engaged even in the small
parts are those who were included in the
Abbey Players when they toured Australia,
except Maureen Delaney, who has remained
in Dublin to keep the home-fires burning.
She and her companions are rehearsing “The
Plough and the Stars.”

“Nero”: Of the original cast of “Monsieur
Beaucaire,” produced by Clyde Meynell for
the Beerbohm Tree co. at Her Majesty’s,
Melbourne, in October, 1903, only Herbert
Leigh appears in the present production. Of
the others, Julius Knight and -Maude Jeffries
have retired from the stage; E. A. Warbur-
ton (the Duke of Winterset) and Hans
Phillips (Lord Townbrake) have gone west;
Eardley Turner (Beau Nash) is playing in
“The Farmer’s Wife,” and Arthur Wontner
( Major Molyneux) is one of the leading
actors in London. Mrs. Walter Hill, who
was the Countess of Greenbury, has also
joined the great majority. She was even
then a very old lady. During the first week
of the run Arthur Wontner and Rose Pen-
dennis, who was also in the cast, were mar-
ried. The ceremony was to have been kept
secret, but the news leaked out. At the end
of the performance on the eventful day Miss
Jeffries caused an enormous bridal bouquet
to be handed up to the blushing bride, and
the orchestra played the Wedding March.
“Flaming Youth”; Frank Hurley has
landed back from New Guinea with his team
of sun-baked Englishmen and the one Aus-
tralian girl, Grade Savieri, who was neces-
sary to introduce the feminine element in
“The Jungle Woman.” They had a multi-
tude of cheap supers, in the Dutch New
Guinea niggers. But they were as stupid as
they were cheap, and wasted thousands of
feet of film before satisfactory pictures were
obtained. At the beginning they were haunted
by memories of white soldiers doing machine-
gun practice, which many of them had seen.
A mob of a few hundred had been assem-
bled for a big scene, but directly the operator
turned his camera upon them their timidity
rose to panic, and, with yells, they bolted
for cover. That bit of film wasn’t a failure;
as a view of panicky nigger flight it sur-
passed anything the nigs, could give when
they knew they were only acting. But gath-
ering the supers, together again was a tiring
business.
“II am fat”: The vivacious Lily Morris
carries somfe weight of years very easily.
She. helped Harry Lauder when Harry made
a hit in the “Mother Hubbard” pantomime
at the Glasgow Royal 23 years ago, on which
occasion he sang “I Love a Lassie” in
public for the first time. Lily was the girl
he was supposed to be singing about.
“Gnarek” : Asche is represented in a Mel-
bourne panto., although his name is not on
the programme. Scenes from “Chu Chin
Chow” form a background for the Dame’s
wheezes and the Principal Boy’s tights. Many
regular theatregoers recognise these old
friends and signify their appreciation in
the usual manner. I suppose it is useless to
express the hope that Oscar’s too solid flesh
will shrink to 1913 proportions, but may his
eye for scenery never grow dim !
“S.G.” : Touching the New York produc-
tion of “White Gold,” by J. Palmer Farsons
(whoever he may be), “Drought” (B.
2 l/l/’2f>) says that the criticisms were
“mixed.” David Worrall, writing to the
Adelaide Advertiser, quotes one Burns
Mantle as writing that “the Australian Gov-
ernment ought to take proceedings to nip
in the bally old bud the distressing impres-
sing of its country given by ‘White Gold’
and Reginald Goode’s ‘Just Beyond,’ ” and
suggesting that “there is surely something to
brighten life in the land where the Anzacs
come from beside droughts, dead sheep, hys-
terical ranchmen and unhappy wives.” David
Worrall adds the following on his own
account: —
The blue-ribbon prize for calamity howling goes
to the dramatists who inflicted the two so-called
Australian plays on Broadway this month. The
only bright feature about them both was that they
were so bad as plays that they fizzled out after
a few performances.
Nothing “mixed” about that.
“F.X.”: Died while on a visit to New
York, S. R. Kennedy, formerly of Randwick
(Sydney), father of Keith, Lance and Laurie,
who have all made a mark, more or less
deep, in the world of music: they began their
career as a family concert party which Dad
managed. Daisy is a cousin of the boys.
Besides his interest in music, S. R. Kennedy
once had a flutter as a racehorse-owner, and
in later years as a Parliamentary candidate.
“Hamfat”: Allan Wilkie has fulfilled his
promise to add “Measure for Measure” to
his repertoire; it opened the Shakspearean
part of his season in Hobart. Before re-
turning to Shakspeare, Wilkie put in a suc-
cessful fortnight with “She Stoops to Con-
quer,” “The Rivals” and “The Bells.” To
fill out the evening while the melodrama in
which Henry Irving used to glory was the
bill, Oscar Wilde’s “A Florentine Tragedy”
was staged. Wilkie is nourishing a hope that
all Australia will show' him the practical
appreciation Hobart has displayed.
“Goldilocks”: Mary Hinton’s embarrass-
ment with her hands during the opening per-
formance of “Monsieur Beaucaire” (B.
2.1/l/’26) illustrates' a major difficulty of
most stage fledglings. An old mechanist
friend of mine, whose criticism is always
sound though his language may be coarse,
invariably uses the actor’s hands as a cri-
terion upon which to base judgment. “Them
’ands! Them carmine ’ands!” he remarked
to me about one imported actor the Firm
v'as booming. “ ’Ow can any blanky man
be a crimson hactor when ’e imagines all
the time ’e’s an asterisk hoctopus!”
“FY7”: I doubt the statement (B.
21/l/’26) that just-dead Billy Warner, the
old-time variety comedian, was a cousin of
the English cricketer “Plum” Warner. Long
before William went to Westralia he was a
circumstance in Queensland, where he was
connected w r ith all sorts of gaffs, including
shed-shows playing the Western pastoral
country at shearing-time. In those .days he
was always rated as a Jew. He not only
looked like one, but often referred to himself
as one of the Chosen. “Plum” Warner’s
tribe w'ere pure English stock, with old in-
terests in the West Indies and the Portu-
guese wine-trade.
“Tabragalba”: A picture-showman of my
acquaintance arranged to get all his supplies
from one particular calimp’ny. The result is
that he has ceased to control his own theatre.
He lias to take the
pictures selected
for him, use the
advertising matter
sent hi m, and
charge the prices
fixed by the calim-
p’ny. When “soo-
per-features” are
shown, the cahm-
p’ny insists on the
prices being raised
and forbids conces-
sions to children.
The showman pays
all expenses—hall
rent, lighting,
orchestra, staff,
advertisements; the
cahmp’ny pays no-
thing, and takes
half the receipts.
Sometimes, if it
thinks fit, it sends
an agent to the
theatre to check
the receipts, and the
inflated returns on
a night when a
“sooper-feature” is
shown are taken as
a basis for fixing
prices for ordinary
films. Tiring of all
this, the victim
wrote to the calim-
p' n y denouncing
“the insatiable de-
sire of some Yan-
kee combines to go
one better every
time.” While he
was about it he
also denounced “the
high-handed Yan-
kee man n e r in
which you force
the Australian ex-
hibitor to lay the
soul of his business
bare, and treat him
as a mere puppet
in the game.” The
cahmp ’ n y, not
minding a few
harsh words, carried on as before. Its hide
is impenetrable, and its contempt for Aus-
tralian legislators immeasurable.
“John’s Wood” (Loud.): Louis Sherwin,
son of Amy, Tasmania’s most famous
singer, lias been appointed to a very import-
ant post in New York—chief publicity agent
for the Frohman theatrical syndicate. He
and his sister Jeanette, both of whom use
their mother’s name, have literary talent,
and when Louis was dramatic critic of the
New York Globe his reviews aroused as
much interest as anybody’s. Jeanette was
in the original production of Noel Coward’s
“Vortex” in America, where it has repeated
its London success without arousing any of
the acid comments which its premiere in
London drew from most of the critics.
“Ivriz”: The too-infrequent service of
steamers between Fremantle and the nor’-
west ports of Groperland has given over-
landing by motor a boost. What was con-
sidered a very strenuous run for a motor
vehicle a few years back —Fremantle to
Wyndliam—-is now practically a weekly
occurrence. The latest to do the trip over-
land from Perth to Broome was a theatrical
company which showed in all the coastal
ports. It has some doubts about its own
drawing-power, so carried along a small
menagerie as a side-line; in a one-ton truck
they had stowed a lion, a leopard and two
monkeys.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: The costume drama is
more popular nowadays with the male than
the female, probably because the modern
female regards_ the excess of dress as silly.
This was particularly brought to my mind
when 1 inspected “Monsieur Beaucaire” from
the gallery—there were more “gods” than
“goddesses.” Incidentally, that part of the
play where Frank Harvey (Beaucaire) pinks,
one, after another, the swordsmen who
obligingly wait their turns, filled one of the
“gods” with disgust. “Cripes!” he remarked,
“That bloke’ll get ’em all. Why doesn’t one
of ’em use a bottle?”
“Curtain-raiser”: Collins-street will be
denied for a season the spectacle of Jules
Grant driving his flivver tied up with string.
The small entrepreneur, who with Bert
Bailey stumbled on a gold-mine by securing
a long lease of Melbourne King's, is off to
England. It will be a pleasure-trip, tinc-
tured with business if plays or players at
fivepence a dozen are offering. Another rich
reef struck by Grant was his solid interest
m On Our Selection.” A couple of weeks’
run of that infallible money-spinner will
get him off the rocks if he ever has the
ill-luck to strike them.
“Lud” : George H. Mulcaster, in Australia
with Hugh Ward’s productions of “Bulldog
Drummond” and “The Faithful Heart,” and
old friend Caleb Porter figure in the cast of
a weird melodrama called “The Ghost
SOMETHING BETTER IN HAND.
FRIEND: “Well, to tide you over, old man, I can offer you a job
at £4 week.”
ONCE FAMOUS ACTOR: “ Thanks, me boy, but it can’t be done —
I make fa-ar more than that borrowing.”
Train” at London St. Martin’s —the train
itself is a triumph of the property-room.
Harry Cohen, late of Dunedin and a well-
known showman in Australia, is managing
the show for the inevitable syndicate, and
it looks like running to good business for
some time.
“Barrier”: Actresses who have played the
part of Peter Pan during the 20 years of
the Barrie play’s life in London have been
the pick of the basket. Nina Boucicault was
the first and, old stagers aver, the best of
all Peters. Cissie Loftus followed; then
Pauline Chase (of America) for seven years
consecutively. Madge Titheradge came next;
then Unity Moore, Pay Compton, Faith
Celli, Georgette Cohan, Edna Best, Joan
Maclean and Gladys Cooper—most of them
high-salaried stars these days. The latest
exponent is Dorothy Dickson, long a favor-
ite song-and-dance damsel with Chariot’s
Revue. In America the original Peter was
Maude Adams. In Australia another
American, Tittell Brune, essayed the role.
On a tour of Maoriland Australia’s Lizette
Parkes gave what, from all accounts, was an
ideal performance.
“Johnny W.”: Having just come back
from a droving trip on which I had collected
a couple of black eyes, a swelling round the
jaw and three or four torn shirts, I per-
suaded my mate to visit the cinema with me
to watch Buck Jones, the famous two-gun
man and stoush artist from Los Angeles. I
hoped to pick up a wrinkle or two. He first
appeared after making a tliree-day journey
on horseback across the wilderness to see a
dying “buddy.” He had no sign of a swag
with him, nor even a billy, but evidently
carried a razor, as he arrived beautifully
clean-shaven. Buck soon got into trouble
with a roomful of stiffs, whom he cleaned up
in good style, chair and boot, tooth and nail
being used in the argument. “Strike me
dead!” whispered my mate, when the hero
stood up surrounded by inert forms, “they’ve
not even mucked up his hair or pulled his
shirt out. Come an’ ’ave a drink; I feel
faint.” And we actually go to the trouble
of importing such rubbish from America!
“Minim” : The worthy Scot who remarked
that he cared not who made the laws so long
as he could make the nation’s songs, or
words to that effect, may be accounted
lucky not to be living to-day. He
would find that the nation’s songs are
being manufactured in the U.S.A., and
the knowledge would probably send him
raving mad. For surely the limit in imbe-
cility is being reached by the vulgar and
illiterate Yankee scribes who turn these
ditties out by the score and find in old Eng-
land and young Australia happy dumping-
grounds for their wares. Consider this
refrain from the latest best-seller:—
Yes, Sir, that’s my baby;
No, Sir, don’t mean “may be.’’
Yes, Sir, that’s my baby now.
Yes, Ma’am, we’ve decided;
No, ma’am, we won’t hide it;
Yes, ma’am, you’re invited now.
By the way, by the way,
When we reach the preacher I’ll say:
“Yes, Sir, that’s my baby;
No, Sir, don’t mean ‘may be,’
Yes, Sir, that’s my baby now!’’
What of the future of a race that is gorged
with American “pitchers” and “songs” of
this description?
“Daisy M.”: “The Ten Commandments”
is said to be the best of the modern fillums.
There is some clever faking in the first part,
but how dreary is the second part, and how
crude the interiors! Mother going off with
her Bible, and the background of the jazzing
scene —as crude as can possibly be imagined!
Our Australian producers must dodge in-
teriors, or (if that is out of the question)
switch them off the screen as quickly as pos-
sible. The close-up is the American pro-
ducer’s method of getting over the difficulty
of the interior. He is quite at home outside
because there Nature makes his picture for
him. The modern Hollywood movie is in
no way better than the pictures Spencer used
to give us in Australia. The Americans killed
Spencer’s enterprise, and thereby stifled the
development of Australian moving-pictures
for a decade. Instead of Spencer we got
Beaumont Smith.
“Lowan”: On a recent Saturday night a
snake entered the Dimboola (Yic.) picture
theatre and coiled up near the piano as if
determined to survey the latest screen stars
in fig leaves. He got a very different recep-
tion from that accorded his predecessor in
Eden. The pianiste fled and several shriek-
ing females stood on chairs. Finally a
practical Scotchman, after several attempts,
slew the intruder. There was a certain
appropriateness in the weapon used; it was
a case that had contained apples.
“P.Y.0.”: Re the film called “The Vic-
torian Railways at Work” (B. 14/l/’26),
Commissioner Clapp is only second in the
field. The first Vic. concern to make a movie
was the Electricity Commission, John
Monash’s big show. That body has three
separate films doing the rounds of the State,
while the Commonwealth has introduced an
epitomised edition of all three into the pic-
tures it sends to Britain for the edification
of the “migrants” it is so anxious to cap-
ture. Stretton-Morgan, who used to do the
Commission’s publicity work, organised the
films.
“Maolsa”: For every adult who attends
the Saturday matinees at our suburban
pitcher-theatre there are least 30 children.
A feature-film recently put. on for the im-
provement of their dear little minds was
“The Fast Set,” adapted from that delect-
able play, “Spring Cleaning.” On the follow-
ing Saturday came “Divorce.” Most of the
smaller tribe were more interested in the
“comic” and the “Western thriller,” but the
bigger ones were plainly absorbed in these
dramas of adultery. I heard one miss in
college garb say to her companion : “Wasn’t he
10-o-vely? I liked him much better than the
husband.” “Oh, so did I,” the other replied.
“Mustn’t it be 10-o-vely to marry and”
Then they passed on.

Schnapps is not
merely a trade name
THE term “Schnapps” is not
merely a trade name. It signifies
a UNIQUE spirit produced in
Schiedam, Holland, and it originated
nearly a century ago with the introduc-
tion of the distinctive beverage, which
has long been world-famous in associ-
ation with the name of “Wolfed.”
€| No other liquor possesses the
FLAVOR, the AROMA or the potent
MEDICINAL VIRTUES that distin-
guish Schnapps, and no other liquor
can be truthfully described as “just the
same as Schnapps.”
€J The simplest way to make certain
of obtaining genuine, pure, aromatic
Schiedam Schnapps is to ALWAYS
ASK FOR “WOLFE’S.”

PETROL
Because of its double-plunger, twin-cylinder piston
pump, a continuous flow of petrol is elevated into
the visible glass container of the Wayne Pump 492-F
with the least effort and in the quickest possible
time.
Its big, visible five (5) gallon container can be filled
and emptied in 20 seconds time.
Moreover, because of an automatic interlocking
valve, an exclusive Wayne feature, which makes
it impossible for any petrol to drain back into the
storage tank and the motor car at the same time,
the customer gets every drop of petrol that he sees.
And due to a float system which works in conjunct-
ion with the discharge lever, the proprietor of a
Wayne Pump has, at all times, a complete and
accurate record of his sales.
In appearance, it is, as the illustration shows, the
most attractive petrol pump yet designed.
Its beauty literally compels attention and due to its
simplicity of construction, upkeep charges are
practically nil, and in operation it is quick and positive.
Passed and approved by the Department
o£ Weights and Measures o£
New South Wales and all other States.
The above is only a partial description of this splendid
petrol pump. For complete details of Wayne Pump 492-F
and other Wayne equipment for the storage, measuring
and pumping of oil and petrol write to: —

tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned

W.F.: Not quite. That sort of experience
has to be done extraordinarily well at this time
of day.... H.W.: Nothing that isn’t generally known
in it Tom Hah:. A bit too crude M.T.H.: We
fell a-dreaming at the 11th verse Jirabul:
Thanks, yes. It was the sin of one 01 those worst-
of-all contributors who won’t write proper names
distinctly. As a matter of fact, they should be
printed.... Emar: “The Engagement’’, is too thin.
....Ronald I.: Not a very shrewd criticism....
J.McK.: You haven’t made it interesting... .A.W.J.:
Too superficial... .A.H.8.: You quote too extensively.
. ...G.L.8.: Poor in matter and dull in manner;
and you had a fine subject, t00....1v.M.: You’ve
missed a great opportunity. Try to put more color
into it... .Bellerive: “Totlinda” is full of feeling:
Totlinda, Totlinda,
False queen of my heart,
You vowed ’neath the stars
From me you’d not part.
When I’d cooee to thee
From under your window,
You’d throw me a kiss,
Oh, faithless Totlinda!
I paid for your shingles.
Your wines and your dinners;
With rapture you’d call me
A saint among sinners.
My God, can it be —
That I am forsaken?
Or is it a dream from
Which I’ll awaken ?
My heart pitter pats;
I’m filled with emotion —-
Totlinda, adieu. I’ll
Jump into the ocean.
. ...8.E.D.: Glad to hear from you; but why hang
your remarks on something the little Welshman said
somewhere or other? 0.H.A.: Doubt if they have
any value. There are plenty available.... D.S.
(Melb.) : The verse only says in a feeble way what
was already' said in the paragraph.... F.R.W.: Not
nearly... .L.V.F.: Keeps to the beaten track and
says nothing new. But it isn’t badly done...,
A.B.C. (Q.) : Can’t say whether you’ll make a poet;
the rhymes you send are not printable. Read and
write—it is the only way....R. Me.: You observe
only the commonplaces of the scene and what you
say would apply to a dozen other bays... .L.E.8.:
No use here....Granodoro: Wild stuff in which there
isn’t much poetry Richard C.: Far too weak
and scraggy to carry an ambitious thing like that
C.C. (Christchurch): The verse has a good many
bumps; but the chief fault is that it says so little.
. ...E.Y. (Lakemba) : No doubt there’s life and
beauty to be found if you “help with the herds,’’
but none of it gets through to the verse John A.:
Not nearly enough material for a yarn there....
W.E.8.; “A Dull Job” is just that P. O. Mac.:
The story is thin and the verse a long way off the
goal. .. .G.T. (Roseville) : Hasn’t enough interest....
R.R.P.: A liews paragraph of a hideous happening
extended to a dull story E.M.S.: The discovery
of the astonishing relationship doesn’t seem to have
troubled them much.... Alfred II.: Made according
to an old recipe.. . .Anne J.: Can’t find the mirth.
... .P.D. (East S. Kilda): It says commonplaces
rather badly... .N.F.C.: Cheap and thin... . Luke A.:
Rather a dreary narration along familiar lines
T.0.D.: Seems to be a sort of prelude and enilogue
with all the tale left out E.M.8.: “Noon’*’ must
go back.... Ripponlea: A powerful fragment of the
violent epic:—
The wife gnawed her cheese and onion and read
her book
As the whistling, wailing, whirling wind the hovel
shook.
But the man couldn’t sleep! Again and again
Ciuel, criminating thoughts crossed and scourged
his brain.
He pantingly paced the room. His eyeballs did roll
Myriads of scorpions seemed crawling in his soul.
Glassy globules from his glum eves were pressed
Onto his flushed cheeks; and trickled down his chest
Donning his coat and hat he left the cot
And went to look for him, who he had tried to swat.
. ...A.R.S.: Falls too often over its own feet....
Georgia R.: Not much in our line, thanks. .. .J.S.M ;
Many a more interesting tooth has met the tame fat e .
.... W.B. (E. St. Kilda): It is a lumbering gait for
so light a ditty R.S.V.: The sonnet is poor.
Most brooks have a habit of tumbling “where their
ways incline’’; so the music can’t be regarded as
unusual.... G.H.W.: What on earth is an “ever-
glade” ?... .0.R.F.: Nicely done, but ends a little
tamely.... Dan D.: The lines are too weak to carry
that sorrowful pun D.E.M.C.: The worst sort of
verse G.S. (Walkerville) : Might make a good lie
if reduced to a paragraph J.R.L.: The verse didn’t
get past the mat Alf. R.: Makes dull reading
E. de 1,.: Your ghost is not very thrilling. .. .W.D.F.:
“Undercurrents” is not for us A.E.P.: He must
have been a very dull sort of lunatic... .A.F.T.:
Sorry, but it doesn’t move us Eseedee: Not enough
there... .Haskett: The verse follows so many others
of its kind and is too slight to win under that
handicap Boyd: Very young and has too many
lumps in it... .E.M. (W.A.) : An, entirely new wav
of stating the case:—
God gave Clay-Man His Mantle bright
And lived in Man a blazing light;
Then Man transgressed the law of love,
God drove him from the home above; ’
Man lost the light that was so bright
Bowd down to toil with all his Might.
I.D.C.: Not up to the mark Cromer: It’s
not the man who is at fault, it is the system. Quite
as bad results would probably happen if they made
admirals out of retired politicians. And in this
case he seems to have got only half the truth from
the adviser who should have given him all the truth.
An Luchorpan: That little discussion is finished!
I.W.: Discussed some time ag0.,.. Breen Street:
Well enough done; but there’s not much grip.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
G. 8.5.: All rather good examples of what isn't
wanted L.W.S.: Why are you so contemptuous
towards perspective? R.K.: Scratches barred
J.H.F.: If that is your idea of a prophet, we don’t
wonder that he isn’t much honored in his own
country... .J.L.: A hopeless quartette... .8.8. A.:
The joke has been a regular visitor for years past
and the drawing is careless 8.5.: We bear no
ill-will towards juvenile genuises; their misguided
barrackers do far more harm W.F.: Sorry
we were not “at home” when the bathing beauty
called... .N.R.: Three feet away it looks passable;
at six inches it is a mass of errors... .G.C.11.:
One well done, but we want more than head studies.

The Objects of the Company,
The company has been formed for the purpose of: —
(1) Taking over from Australian Piers, Limited, all its right, title and interest, and all its obligations
under an indenture of lease and an agreement entered into with it on 14th July, 1924, by the Council
of the Municipality of Randwick.
(2) Erecting on the land leased an Ocean Promenade Pier, with Theatre, Ballroom and Concert Hall,
Stalls, Restaurant, etc.
(3) Carrying into effect agreements with Australian Piers, Limited, and G. L. D. James, drafts of
which have been identified by W. J. Creagh, solicitor.
(4) Repaying to Australian Piers, Limited, the sum of £lOOO deposited by it with the Council of
the Municipality of Randwick as a guarantee of good faith. This deposit is carrying bank interest
current on fixed deposits.
The Lease and Agreement.
These documents can be seen at the office of the Company.
The main points of the lease are:—
(1) TERM; 28 years from 11th July, 1924.
RENTAL: From date until construction finished, £lO per annum. After completion, £540 per
annum.
(2) The Municipal Council of Randwick agrees to take all steps necessary to endeavor to obtain from
the Crown a renewal of the lease and to give the Company first refusal of such renewal.
(3) The right to charge up to 6d. per person over 14, and 3d. for children under 14, for entrance to
the Pier.
(4) The right to close the Pier for special occasions, fetes, gala nights, etc., and to reopen the
same on a further charge for admission.
Resistance to Storms.
The Pier will be built on comparatively narrow piles, which offer little resistance to the waves.
The Coogee Pier will stand securely where the most solidly-constructed wall would be likely to
suffer damage.
English Ocean Piers on piles stand splendidly year after year.
The Coogee Pier will be considerably stronger than any similar pier constructed in England, or in
any part of the world.
NO STORMS WILL AFFECT IT ; however, the Pier will be insured against all possibilities of this
description.
Consulting Engineer’s Report.
The technical report of Mr. G. L. D. James, M.l.Mech. E., is entirely favorable to the project.
“The entire work of the Coogee Pier will be carried out in accord-
ance with the specification approved of by the Public Works Depart-
ment, and under one of its engineer’ s supervision.”
Details of the Coogee Pier.
The Pier for Coogee will be about 910 feet long, extending from the centre of the sea-wall opposite
Belmore-road straight into the middle of the bay. It will be about the length of.. Mart in-place from
the “Sun” office to George-street.
At the entrance its width will be 69 feet for a length of about 70 yards ; then 40 feet for a dis-
tance of a little under 150 yards ; then the pier will be about 52 feet wide and 80 yards long. Half-
way down the neck the Pier is widened to about 66 feet to allow' space for a bandstand with a
promenading area on each side.
The turnstiles and office accommodation will be set about 20 yards from the sea-wall, and to sea-
ward of them will be cloak-rooms and other accommodation for visitors, and a children’s day-nursery in
charge of competent attendants.
Down the centre of the neck will be a wind and sun shelter with seats facing outboard on either
side, where protection can be obtained from the elements if necessary. Other seats will be placed at
convenient places, but so as not to detract from the Pier’s primary function of a promenade.
On the pier-head will be a full-sized theatre, seating about 1400; a ballroom where 600 can dance
in comfort, and on the first floor a restaurant to seat 400. There will also be a number of shops to serve
immediate requirements of visitors.
These buildings will have ample space on either side for promenaders, right out to the very end of
the Pier.
In addition, there will be access to a balcony on two sides of the pier-head buildings.
Tramway Traffic to Coogee.
26,610,748 people used the Coogce tram-line in 1923, and 28,276,552 in 1924. About half of these
travelled in the last section —King-street, Randwick, to Coogee Beach—and an exhaustive analysis shows
that of these over 54 millions annually were Coogee-bound holiday-makers. Allowing a 15 per cent, in-
crease for the added* attraction of the Pier, it is established that nearly 7,000,000 people will be
possible Pier patrons. Of these 2,000,000 -per annum on week-ends and holidays, paying a toll of 6d.,
and 1,250,000 per annum on other days will bring in a toll revenue of £65,625. Rentals of restaurant,
theatre, ballroom, shops, advertising space, etc., etc., are estimated to bring in £13,912 per annum, giv-
ing a total revenue of £79,537.
Expenses, including £4200 per annum sinking fund, are estimated liberally at £34,265 per
annum, leaving nett profits available for dividend at £45,272, or over 20 per cent, per annum.
These figures have been inspected by Messrs. Starkey and Starkey, public accountants and auditors,
who write as follows:
“We have'examined the tramway traffic figures and the forecasts of revenue and expenditure as stated
in this prospectus, and in our opinion such figures and estimates are fair and reasonable. The calcula-
tion of the estimated number ,of visitors to Coogee by tram is based upon actual traffic figures obtained
from the traffic manager’s office of the New South Wales Government Tramways.”
Yours faithfully,
(Sgd.) STARKEY and STARKEY.

Cost and Capital.
The technical report of Mr. G. 1. D. James, Consulting Engineer, estimates the cost of the struc-
ture complete will be £170,000, and the time required for construction about one and a half years.
The company has already had an offer from a well-known firm of constructional engineers to con-
struct the Pier at a figure considerably under this estimate. The firm in question has been concerned
in building many piers in England, as well as bridges and other structural steelwork on a large scale
in Australia, and its members are eminently well qualified to form an opinion after seeing the plans.
The amount of working capital required is very small, as the business will be in the very advan-
tageous position, compared with an ordinary commercial undertaking, of not having any stocks to carry
nor credits to finance.
Vendor Consideration.
The vendor company, Australian Piers, Limited, will receive 21,000 fully-paid-up shares in the
capital of the company and a cash consideration of £4OOO for transfer of its interests and obliga-
tions under a sub-lease and agreement made with the Municipal Council of Randwick. This consideration
also covers expenses in connection with the negotiations and investigations which have enabled the vendor
company to obtain a lease on very favorable terms and present a scheme most suited for Australian condi-
tions and embracing the most modern practices in pier-building.
Registration and Promotion Expenses.
The expenses of and incidental to the formation, flotation and registration of the company will be
borne by the company.
Contracts.
The following agreements already entered into may be inspected at the office of the company:—
(a) Between Municipal Council of Randwick and Australian Piers, Limited, dated 14th July, 1924
(lease).
(b) Between Municipal Council of Randwick and Australian Piers, Limited, dated 14th July, 1924
(agreement).
(c) Brokerage agreement and underwriting agreement between Coogee Ocean Pier Cp., Ltd., and
Phoenix Investment Trust, Ltd., each dated 21/12/’25
The following agreements are to be entered into before the construction commences, and may be
inspected at the office of the company:—
(d) Between Australian Piers, Ltd., and Coogee Ocean Pier Co., Ltd. (vendor agreement).
(e) Between Coogee Ocean Pier Co., Ltd... and George Llewellyn Denton James (agreement with
the consulting engineer).

What Dividends Piers Pay to English Investors.
The Southsea Clarence Esplanade Pier Co., Ltd., Portsmouth, England, has declared dividends of
10 per cent., 15 per cent., 20 per cent, and 30 per cent, with £2 per share bonus; a 20 per cent, dividend
has been paid regularly now for the past six years.
The Brighton West Pier Company in its letter says, inter alia, “We usually pay a dividend of
10 per cent, on the year.”
Southend-on-Sea Pier—a municipally-controlled project —is, according to the borough accountant, “a
remunerative one, and large sums have from time to time been applied out of profits to aid tfie rates.”
The Great Yarmouth Pier, has (except during the war) paid dividends regularly.
Further, it must be remembered that English seaside resorts have only a very short season —-
COOGEE HAS A SEVEN-MONTHS SEASON. The balance of the year, namely, five months, will always
find a fair crowd at Coogee, irrespective of the weather.
Is it not fair to assume that Coogee’s Pier estimates are, in the light of the above experience,
reasonable ?

worth 4s. per lb., and about five good pelts
making up the weight.

“Saddler Simm”: Despite “Khabionba”
and “Irel” (B. 31/12/’25), there is much
uncertainty about hogskin; hence it is no
longer an indispensable constituent of a
saddle. Buckjump saddles are now made
mostly of rough-out bag-leather to help the
“plaster” stick when a bucker throws him
up and partly catches him. Also, chrome
leather is coming into general vogue for polo
and other light saddles. The racing scribes
who perpetually record that “Johnny Arm-
strong was in the pigskin” overlook that he
is often in good Australian kangaroo. The
shape of a hogskin seat depends entirely
upon the web and sole-leather foundation
upon which rests the flock stuffing. It may
look as shapely as a sylk-arto stocking tak-
ing a long stride, but it’s the foundation
that is responsible for the symmetry in each
case.
* * * *
“Esship”: Found her final resting-place,
the old Monowai, well known to travellers
of the last generation. The steamer, which
for the last six years has been rusting away
at anchor at Port Chalmers, goes to form
part of a breakwater near Gisborne, having
been bought for £12,000. She came to Maori-
land new in 1890, and though only 3400 tons
gross was the biggest ship in the Union
line when launched. She made an engineer-
ing record of a freakish sort by keeping her
engines running continuously on her maiden
voyage from Glasgow to Dunedin —4,333,148
revolutions without a stop. Regarded as a
sort of floating palace in her day, she was
popular with passengei-s on the ’Frisco-Auck-
land run, to which she was first assigned,
and later she did service on the coastal run
from Auckland to Dunedin. The Monowai
got vei'y black in 1913 when she was used
to accommodate strike-breakers in Auckland
—it wasn’t safe to keep ’em ashore —and her
experiences included two terms as a troop-
ship—in the S’African War and the Big
Scrap ; in the latter her part was the occu-
pation of Samoa, in conjunction with the
Moeraki.
* * * *
“C.Q.” : Some of the transactions in Mel-
bourne’s real estate last year should make
John Batman turn in his grave. On the
outer fringes, such as North Cobui’g, pi’ices
ranged up to £4 15s. a foot. At Brighton,
six miles from the centre of the city, £25
was considered a fair figure for an ocean-
fi’ontage. South Carlton has shown the
most violent progress. A corner fragment
with a depth of 55ft. in that locality jumped
from £lB to £4O a foot in 18 montlis. Such
sites are wanted for factory buildings. In
the end of Collins-street where the chirur-
geons most do congregate, land which in 1922
changed hands for £302 was sold again last
year for £375, and further up in the same
thoroughfare a bit of soil went for £6OO a
foot. One of the saddest speculators was
the man who sold a block for £4OOO and
then bought it back for twice the money.
The star transaction concerned a patch in
the centre of the city which cost its new
possessor £2400 a foot. It wasn’t far from
where old Batman successfully concluded
Melbourne’s first land deal (1835). The area
involved was 500,000 acres, and the annual
rental accepted by the eight chiefs who said
they owned it was 100 blankets, 100 knives,
100 tomahawks, 50 suits, 50 looking-glasses,
50 scissoi’s and five tons of flour.
* * * *
“Bill Ding”: Another globe-trotter who
looked in at a few Australian sawmills and
saw chunks of dozey, waney, sappy wood
hurtled over the elevators to the firelieaps
has been telling a city newspaper that his
feelings were shocked at the woeful waste of
valuable wood. How little some of these
wanderers know about it! With the pre-
sent high costs of production, due to ever-
shortening hours and ever-gi’owing cost of
materials, from the 6ft. breaking-down saw
to the 12-in. file which renews its teeth, saw-
millers would be fools indeed to send any
bit of planking of saleable dimension over
to the fireheap. The sawmiller has paid big
wages to his bush bosses, his fallers, teamsters
and winchmen, has fed and maintained mobs
of expensive horses, paid a big loco, crew
and seen that costly tramlines are in good
running order. He wants every inch of solid
wood he can get to recoup him. What is
burnt is not even “junk,” and it is doubtful
if any self-respecting carpenter or joiner
would thank you for a dray-load tipped in
liis back yard. Where a sawmill is fairly
contiguous to a town, some of the “waste”
is converted into firewood, but that has to
compete with the itinerant firewood-seller,
and sometimes it can’t do that.


Whatever Your
Skin Trouble
At this time of the year irritated, inflamed conditions
of the skin, due to the hot weather, excessive perspiration
or dry winds, are common. These troubles should be
regarded as a possible source of the more obstinate skin
ailments, such as eczema, ulcers, or poisoned sores, and
should be treated at once with Zam-Buk.
Start now and coax your skin back to health with
nightly dressings of this balm—the first applications of
which will end the dreadful itching and act as a tonic.
The regular use of Zam-Buk has a far-reaching influence;
composed of highly-refined essences which are readily
absorbed by the skin, Zam-Buk soaks through the pores,
attacking the trouble at its source and so ridding the
tissues of all impurities.
Lastly, when all sore, inflamed parts have been
soothed and cleared, and all swellings allayed, there is a
splendid new growth of healthy, strong skin. Zam-Buk
cannot but have a wholly beneficial effect on your skin, as it is free from
animal fats and coarse mineral drugs, which only clog the pores and often
retard healing.
Don t endure fiery skin torture a day longer, get a box of Zam-Buk from
your chemist or storekeeper. Nothing can equal it in cases of skin rash,
blotches, prickly heat, sun-burn, heat rash, insect bites, piles, sore feet, scalp
sores, etc. Also as a sure healer for cuts, bruises and burns. Sold at 1/6
per box, or 3/6 family size.

“Windsor”: Regarding the occupations of
members of the new House of Reps. (B.
31/12/’25), the profession that came off
worst was that of teacher. The five candi-
dates who so described themselves all fell by
the wayside, one of them (McDonald) being
a retiring member.
Sergeant Gamble, the Black Watch vet-
eran who made the veterans of Great
War look infantile at Lord Allenby’s wel-
come to Melbourne, saw Balaclava, Egypt,
China, Lucknow, Rorke’s Drift and Majuba
Hill, and then decided that he had had
enough. And that was nearly 70 years ago.
N. S. Wales still retains family connection
with Captain Cook. The Fleck family, of
Guildford, are direct descendants of the
Batts, into wiiose family Cook married. The
Flecks come of a line of seafarers, and Cap-
tain Crofton Fleck, founder of the Austra-
lian family, commanded several vessels trad-
ing out of Sydney.
“Alwyn”: January 12 should have been
„an anniversary of particular interest to
Reggie Black, M.L.C. of the Ma State. On
that date, 125 years ago, there arrived in
Port Jackson, under the command of his
grandfather, Capt. John Black, the Har-
binger, an armed brig of 56 tons, with six
guns, carrying a crew of twenty and general
merchandise. She was the first trading ship
to reach Sydney through Bass Strait.
“ILK.”: Apropos brief wills (B.
17/12/'25). Kingston didn’t waste any
words; “I Charles Cameron Kingston, of
Adelaide, solicitor, by this my last will, give
all my estate, real and personal, to my wife,
Lucy May Kingston, whom I appoint sole
executrix.” Incidentally, William Jenkins,
old-time minor Geelong poet, left a will in
the form of a 32-line rhyme, of which pro-
bate was duly granted.
R. J. Champion enjoyed only a few months
of leisure after a busy 52 years in the
public service of South Aus. Finance was
his strong point, and he put in over 20 years
in the Agent-General’s office in London, under
Grainger, Jenkins, Kirkpatrick, Young and
Lucas. When his health broke down he
came back to his State in 1921, and served
four years as secretary to the Adelaide Hos-
pital, where (as it happened) he had started
his career as a youngster. Only 67 at the
end.
Thera is a cook in a Pitt-street (Sydney)
restaurant whose great-great-grandfather
was son of the cook who made George lll.’s
dumplings—the dumplings that so puzzled the
monarch because he couldn’t make out how
the apples got inside, since he could find no
stitches in the cover. The son was trans-
ported for poaching rabbits, but the discovery
of his skill at poaching eggs gained him his
release, and he became preparer of food for
some of Australia’s early notables. The
habit of being cooks has prevailed in every
generation since.
Had a 90th birthday on January 15, Saul
Solomon, now of Northam in Westralia. He
started business as a photographer in Bal-
larat, but went to Adelaide in 1868, and put
in some 40 years there before moving west.
Just once he came into the limelight, when
in 1887 he beat “Honest Tom” Playford for
his apparently secure seat at East Torrens.
In those days there was an escape door for
prominent men in such circumstances. Play-
ford simply had himself nominated for the
country district of Newcastle, and at the
election held a fortnight later he got back
to the Assembly and at once began a two
years’ term as Premier.
“80. Aim”: “Muts” discounts “R.B.’s”
claim (B. 3./12/’25) to be an Australian
descendant of Katherine Parr, the final wife
of Flenry VIII., by asserting that the lady
died childless (B. 24/12/’25). Here he is
wrong; the child lived, although the mother
died eight days after the birth. When this
child was six months old her father, Lord
Thomas Seymour, was beheaded. The his-
tory of the young Mary Seymour is some-
what vague, but records show that she lived
to marry a Sir Edward Bushel, to whom she
had at least one child, Mary, who married
a Silas Johnson. Various relics of Kath-
erine Parr were in the possession of their
descendants until the death, during the last
century, of Henry Johnson, of Bath, who
bequeathed them to Agnes Strickland. I am
indebted to her and others for this para-
graph.
Queensland electorates take some getting
over. Kennedy (294,985 square miles) is
nearly as big as N. S. Wales. Maranoa
(217,937 square miles) is a trifle larger
than Victoria, Tasmania and M.L. put to-
gether. Even the State electorates are im-
mense. Gregory, represented by Chairman
of Committees Pollock, covers 106,360 sq.
miles, and has an elector to every 20 sq.
miles or so. Cook (98,280 sq. miles) could
take Victoria in with 10,000 sq. miles to
spare. Randolph Bedford patrols 70,800 sq.
miles along the Warrego, and Darby Rior-
dan looks after 66,600 sq. miles in the
Gulf Country. Balonne (44,800 sq. miles)
is comparatively small—less than twice the
size of Tasmania. Five other electorates
sprawl over from 20,000 to 28,000 sq. miles
each, and another five are from 10,000 to
13,000 sq. miles each.
“Retired Volt” : While I haven’t any par-
ticular regard for Percy Hunter or his quali-
fications for steering the Pacific Cable Board
through its coming battle with wireless com-
petition, I can’t agree with the technical
staff that a layman is necessarily incapable
of directing such activities. The affairs of
the huge English association which con-
trols over 50 per cent, of the world’s cables
are managed by men who don’t know a
Wheatstone bridge from a bull’s foot. One
of them is a retired admiral who helped
to hound down the Emden and another is a
soldier. The laying of the first cable across
the Atlantic was conceived and largely
financed by a cotton-spinner. He put
£250,000 into the cable —the technical men
put 2000 volts into it and burst it up in two
minutes. The next attempt parted half-way,
and a million pounds’ worth of iron, copper
and gutta percha was left on the bottom of
the ocean. But the cotton-spinner still had
some faith and some money left, and at the
third attempt Queen Victoria was able to
pass the time of day with the President of
the U.S.A.

One-Profit* Studebakers
outclass in power all cars of their
weight and size
Studebaker Standard Six
Duplex-Phaeton
£450
Combines the freedom of an open car 'with
the comfort and protection afforded
by an enclosed car.
Only Studebaker in the fine-
car field and Ford in the low-
price field, make all their own
engines, bodies, gear boxes,
steering gears, clutches, dif-
ferentials, springs, axles, gray
iron castings and drop forg-
ings. By thus eliminating pro-
fits which other manufacturers
pay to outside parts and body-
makers, Studebaker is able to
offer values which no other
manufacturer in the fine-car
field can possibly match.
Because all vital parts are de-
signed, engineered and manu-
factured under one super-
vision, there is the further ad-
vantage of the Unit-Built
construction.
The Studebaker Big Six is the fastest selling high-pow-
ered car in the world. There are but seven American
made automobiles having as much or more power.
And they sell at two to four times the price of the
Big Six.
The Standard Six (illustrated) is, according to Royal
Automobile Club rating, the most powerful car of its
weight and size in the world. Regardless of the condition
of the road to be travelled, it has abundant power to
negotiate it without strain.
The great power of Studebaker engines has been dem-
onstrated repeatedly. Hundreds of Studebaker records
have been established for endurance, reliability and speed.
Although these tests are significant, no demonstration
is so conclusive in proving the power of Studebaker cars
as the day-by-day service that thousands of Studebaker
cars are rendering in the hands of satisfied users.
“No-Yearly-Models” policy stabilizes Studebaker values

WHY NOT ENJOY A GOOD
COMPLEXION?
You cannot if you do not care for the delicate skin of the face. When you wash your
face, do you realise that it is not enough to simply remove the dirt, but that your skin
needs a soothing, healing influence to keep your complexion fresh and free from blemish?
Scented toilet soaps are often very pleasant, but do not assert this influence, as you are well
aware. Many of them contain free alkali, which tends to dry up the skin and destroy
its delicate texture.
Even the better class of such soaps do not in any way help to improve the skin, but
Rexona Skin and Facial Soap
is not only an absolutely pure
soap, but is medicated on the
same principle as the famous
Rexona Ointment, which is
famous throughout all of Aus-
tralasia as the Rapid Healer.
That is why Rexona Soap really
does for the skin and face what
cosmetics are supposed to do,
by ensuring not only a clean
face, but a pure and healthy
skin, and thus gives you a
clear complexion.

The Conquerors.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE men whose blood was sweeter than
the juice
Of yellow grapes upon a sunlit wall,
Whose breath was like the winds the springs
set loose , , . ~
In evening valleys where the_ thrushes cal ,
Died, one by one, beside the river gates
Of Avestan, beneath the orchard trees,
And the great Khan, whose vultures were
the Fates,
Passed with his banners to the utmost seas.
But in the desert grasses lived a song
Which w T as the common music of their lips.
It fell on dull men’s ears like some far gong
Whose honey of dim golden music drips
Down perfumed evenings in a cedar shade
When weary merchants in some purple
pass
Unyoke the oxen, and with lips afraid
Tell o’er their yellow beads of Indian glass.
So sweet a sound it was that lepers heard
And went forth clean from hearing; and
fierce men,
With blood upon their ragged sleeves, were
stirred
To strange and sudden mercy. In his den
The snarling lion pricked his tawny ears
And left his bleeding prey, content to hear.
Lean-flanked and hungry, through the reedy
spears
Of jungle swamps, he went a deathless
year.
So for a thousand moons in Avestan
The grasses sang the ruined shrines to
peace,
And the long river delicately ran
To water the wild fig and bring increase
To the blown woods of peach and apricot
That wasted their sparse harvest on the
birds.
Clear music lingered in a land forgot,
Clear music and a flight of tongueless
w ? ords.
In bitter flight before the Northern spears
The little Khan drew back his broken
horde,
He who was heir to the red.* wasted years,
Whose empire w r as the glimmer of a sword
Untempered by the deeds of! holier fame.
Defeat was in the drooping of his beard;
His tarnished silver bridle with the stud
• Of turkis trembled when btis stallion reared
Amid the desert blossoms rtid as blood.
Almost he fell from his high? saddle there
Upon the river bank of A vest an.
The great steed snorted gusts of fiery air
And his fierce eye in terro r seemed to scan
The haze that on the yellow summer lay,
Then drooped his arching neck and pacing
slow
Came to the mounds where rnen of yesterday
Slept through all trumpet cries the world
might blow.
There came a music sweeter than the call
Of harps of glass under Uhe magic fan
Of beauty’s breath in Kanljalu’s high hall.
Amid the quiver of the r ;eds it ran,
Piercing all hearts with sweetness of desire
For some fair thing too exquisite for
speech ;
And as men gaze upon the 'holy fire,
The spearmen halted, loo’dng each on each.
The little Khan drew forth Ins father’s sword
And laid it at the feet of one low mound ;
The host in order, with nc* spoken word,
Laid down their arms upon the desert

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DENNY DENEEN was the kingpin of
Quartpot; and store, hotel,, butchery,
orchard, tin-dredges and all Denny’s
other enterprises proceeded pros] lerously—
in the way of business, that takes tribute
of. every newcomer and every new local baby.
But the energetic Denny loved thin game as
greater than the stake, or, at least, as being
as great; and, the difficulties of establish-
ment of his many enterprises ove rpast, he
was gripped by the weariness of r< >utine.
He therefore welcomed the neu s of the
dispersing sale of an equally energetic man
who had -dared too much in the -wrong en-
vironment, so that all his property 1 lad come
to the hammer. It was not, that De nny wel-
comed another’s downfall • 'but now that it
had happened the scent assaulted
Denny’s business nose, Sand he boarded a
train and then a back-co 1 untry Ford car for
the scene of defeat—Diorfite, a broken mining
camp that had known much promise and
no performance.
Denny enjoyed the dispute of bidding at
that sheriff’s sale, and in t the renewed experi-
ence of fighting bought more than he had
intended. Not only the i big man of Diorite
had gone down in the fig ht; Diorite i tself was
selling off, and Denny bought privately two
houses for removal to 1 Quartpot. Of the big
man’s assets Denny t* jught at the sheriff’s
sale a timber area repr ited to carry two mil-
lion feet of pine, half i i million feet otf cedar
and five million feet of mixed carob-bean,
silky oak and the pinl: feycamore timber-men
name “maiden’s blush’ ’ j two hundred mixed
cattle as unused to Ifuman handling as
wasps; forty pigs wh deli seemed to be com-
posed of nose, razorb/ iclr, and squeal in equal
proportions; and the printing plant, copy-
right and debts of the Diorite Argus, the
local newspaper that had lived painfully for
six months and then died without moan or
struggle. Finally he bought a lame race-
horse and a church.
“What do you want with a church?” said
the auctioneer, who had waited for safety
until Denny had made his payments.
“Haven’t I bought a newspaper, then, an'
a printin’ mashin’? An’ where would I get
a newspaper office better than a church?
’Tis me that’ll pull down that church and
number the planks of it, an’ build it up
again in Quartpot for the Quartpot Argus,
me man ; a big, roomy, accommodatin’ office,
an’ the blessedness uv the buildin’ to keep
me editor in good ways.”
“You’ll get an editor from Sydney, I sup-
pose?”
“Yes, but pity ’tis that you didn’t have
wan to sell to-day. I’d get him cheap, with-
out a bid ag’in me.”
Denny started men building a timber shoot
and working logging teams on his timber
land; superintended the dismantling and re-
moving to Quartpot of the church and print-
ing plant, and the disposal of the wild cattle
and many of the protesting pigs; entrained
his lame racehorse and himself, and returned
to Quartpot bringing his sheaves and bacon
with him, and finding criticism.
“A lime ricehorse ain’t nothin’,” said
Uncle Clegliorn, the bellman, much malt
having made him unusually brave.
“Will y’ talk to me!” replied Denny in-
dignantly. “ ’Tisn’t lame he is, but tendther-
footed; tendther in the foot he is as you
are in the head, me poor shtupid man from
London. Never a horse like that did y’ see
on your uncle’s farm in the Mile End-road ;
an’ a pedigree he have longer than your
shtickybeak av a nose, an’ that’s talkin’ long
ways back, before the curse of Crummle kem
to Oiroland.”
* s * *
The old church from Diorite rose again
in Quartpot between Denny Deneen’s butch-
ery and Denny Deneen’s store. Puttifoot,
the journeyman butcher, considered that the
scent of tiie butchery might affect the edi-
torial nerves, but the materialistic Denny
answered objections with the fact of the
converted building being properly situated
for power. “I’ll run a belt tro’ th’ side
wall,” said Denny, “an’ the karasene-engine
can print the paper whin it isn’t cutting
sossiges.”
And at last, the old church becoming the
new printing office of the Quartpot Argus
without losing any of its sacred architecture,
Denny sent to Sydney for an editor and two
printers, all-round hands, suitable for type-
setting, imposition and machining. Mean-
time Micky, the handy lad of the grocery,
and Puttifoot canvassed for advertisements
and subscribers, as side-lines to their work
on the carts of the butchery and the store.
But the advertisements in the first number
of the Quartpot Argus served principally to
illustrate the magnitude of its owner. It
told the little world of Granite that Denny
Deneen’s butchery sold the best of meat, and
that corned beef and small goods were his
“speciality”; that Denny Deneen’s hotel
catered for man and beast; that Deneen’s
store had a new shipment of dates and sold
“Modes et Robes” (the phrase was an affec-
tation of Deneen’s millinery sales-lady, whose
insistence wore her proprietor’s objections
thin enough to break) ; that Denny Deneen’s
transport company removed light or heavy
goods far and near; and that Denny Deneen
required two men for orchard work, and
three dredge-hands used to tin-drifts.
The new editor, finding the available local
news to be almost as exclusive to his pro-
prietor as the local advertising, charged all
his own faults to Quartpot and none of them
to himself.
The new editor —Herbert Richardson
Trant —was a very English representative of
very-respectable journalism; a long, griev-
ously thin man who whistled in sibilant
speech and ended his sentences hissingly.
To him journalism was not human; he
preached after the manner of the most jingo-
istic period of English newspaperdom. No-
body under the rank of a stockbroker can
live in such journalism. He disguised with
stagey words his inability to think; his lead-
ers were rich in such phrases as “right-think-
ing people” and “the time is ripe”; he
scarcely admitted the existence of the beastly
Colonies he had been wished on in one of
Fate’s malevolent moods; and the first issue
of the Quartpot Argus carried the wail of
a sick immigrant for “Town” —by which he
meant London, there being not any towns in
Australia worthy the name.
As Denny, in his capacity of proprietor,
had invited all his friends and employees
to. be contributors, the first issue of _ the
Quartpot Argus represented a wide diver-
sity of style, the more notable because the
printer had imposed the paragraphs in order
of length, beginning one line long and ending
a quarter-column.
Denny read the first issue of his paper,
half admiring, half irritated. The references
to himself outside of his great showing in
the advertising pages were many. Mr.
Deneen, J.P., had fined certain malefactors
for permitting goats to stray; Mr. Deneen,
president of the Quartpot branch of the Aus-
tralian Labor party, had begun organisation
for next election ; the Denny Deneen No. 2
dredge had cleaned up ten tons of tin for
the month.
Denny snorted at the leader, which was
built on the lines of halfpenny Fleet-street.
The new editor talked of Australia as if it
were a Mediterranean colony paying tribute
to the glorious ideals of Freetrade; and _ lie
requested Quartpot to keep alive the spirit
of Malplaquet, Ilamillies and Oudenarde, of
Trafalgar’s Bay and of the war against the
Boers. Denny bristled as he read that
leader and the first paragraph, which con-
gratulated the Quartpot Argus upon achiev-
ing Mr. H. Richardson Trant, B.A. (Oxon),
as its first editor.
Denny smiled as he read the efforts of
the local contributors, and groaned when
samples of imported journalism succeeded
them, in this way:—
Our C.P.S., Mr. Alovsius McShane, LL.B., Sergeant
Hood, and a party of Goondiwindi visitors bad a
good time among the wild duck last week.
Jim Oleghorn topped the market for apples last
month.

“The World’s Largest Men’s <& Bogs’ Wear Store
“Good b’y, -Tim ; ’tis the worker ye are,”
said Denny.
His R.H. the Prince of Wales is a great social
success as a jazzer.
“Grrrh!” said Denny.
Mr. H. Richardson Trant, B.A. (Oxon), Editor of
the Quartpot Argus, has many distinguished relatives
in English letters, and had great success as a
journalist in Town. He is distantly related to
the Earl of Boglands.
“May the divil admire liim!” said Denny.
A pretty story is told of his Majesty the King. On
one occasion while visiting the East End his atten-
tion was attracted to a small boy who was eating
an apple, and gazing on Royalty with admiring eyes.
His Majesty tapped the child on the head and
said brightly—“ Why ! It’s a little boy !”
“’Tis a confused mind lie have, God help
hint!’ said Denny. “An’ where’s Bringa-
iily’s article on the co-operative marketin’
of fruit, then?”
He searched the paper, but it was not
there. Instead, there was an article signed
“H. Richardson Trant, B.A. (Oxon).” It
was an article that should not have been in
a newspaper owned by Denny Deneen. It
was an article against the Irish Free State;
and, with that Christian tolerance which
makes the English beloved all over the world,
it laid down as fact the story that the Irish
are unfit for self-government, and that they
really love to be under the heel of the good
Conservative British Government, and to
have their laws solely the work of the House
of Lords.
And there were other journalistic crimes
to madden the proprietor of the Arc, us —
paragraphs booming immigrant explorers
who were discovering places in Australia
settled fifty years before; paragraphs glori-
fying imported dullards who held Australia
as a poor country and Australians as deplor-
able people, because they were not as in-
ferior countries and inferior peoples oversea.
“Damn the pommy scribbler!” said Denny
to his friend Aloysius McShane —“he leave
out Bringalily’s fine article on co-operative
marketin’, and put in a grand slam agin
Oireland. I'll put ’im through the printin’
mashin,’ an’ print the ‘Wearin’ uv the Green’
on his carcase, and I’ll”
“You’ll do nothing,” said Aloysius Mc-
Shane.
“Nothing ! Wit’ a felly leavin’ out Bringa-
lily’s article that was writ like Bringalily
talks, so a white man can understand, an’
printin’ onnatural shtuff that sounds like a
Gcvmint Gazetty with the whereases left
out.”
“Wait,” said Aloysius McShane. “This
fellow will tie himself up.”
“An’ tie me up wit’ libel.”
“I’ll read every issue before it goes to press.
You’re the proprietor you get me the
proofs.”
“I’ll have to keep me patience dry, then.”
“It will pay you to. Sack this fellow
now, and he’d go for you for half a year’s
salary. I think that’s the waster’s game,
for he’d never last anywhere for half a year.”
So Denny prepared himself to bear the
presence of foreign journalism after he'd
made his final protests.
“Ye’ve got here, Mr. Thrant,” said Denny,
“an article on ‘Clothing in the Middle Ages,’
whin the people didn’t wash, and wore their
clothes until they was incorporated wit’ their
shkins. And an article on ‘Belfreys in Eng-
land,’ whin Uncle is the only bellman we
know.”
“But there’s no local news, Mr. Deneen.”
“No local news! Did y’ have the acci-
dent to number wan dredger? Or the tin
run for the mont’ ? Did y’ have slitock pas-
sin’s an’ truckin’s? Did y’ have the twins
born at Shugarloaf? Ye did not. Did y’
have the arrival of the Bad Man from Goon-
diwindi afther deliverin’ a t’ousan’ mixed
cattle at the Border? Ye did not.”
, “You mean the drovin’ person who was
inebriated and was singin’ in the next room
in your hotel?”
“I do._ Out of the garden of his heart
was he singin’ after the long and crool miles
from Ant’ony’s Lagoon over the big long
plains the likes av ye can’t imagine. ’Tis
him, no less. The good man calls himself
the Bad Man from Goondiwindi. An’ the
worst crime he ever did was to eat corn’
beef a Fridays.”
“I’ll see lie’s mentioned this issue,” said
the thin-lipped Trant with such malevolence
in his tone that Denny looked at him curi-
ously.
“Y'll do just that, then,” said Denny as
he left the ex-church and present printery,
an’ see that Bringalily’s article is the
leader, even if there isn’t room to talk about
the hop crops in Kent or the pedigree of
the King of Paris.”
Satisfied with his sarcasm, Denny pro-
ceeded to his hotel, there finding the Bad
Man cheerfully in his liquor and in full pos-
session of his faculties. “Ye’ll be in the paper
this wepk, Goondiwindi,” said Denny Deneen.
“I tould that pommy editor I’ll’ have ye
there with the run of = 'the dredge an’ the
Shugarloaf twins. He don’t like y’r beautiful
voice, Goondiwindi, singin’ like a t’rush that’s
been at Bundaberg rum.”
“He’s a liar,” replied the Bad Man. “I
was singin’ like a flamin’ angel. What he
hated in me singin’ was the Irish of it.”
“Oh ho ! Oh ho ! The Irish uv it, was it?
An what were you singin’ in Irish, Goondi-
windi ?”
“ ‘Musha a-ding-dong-da,’ an’ ‘The Wearin’
uv the Green,’ an’ “Sittin’ be the Shtile,
Mary.’ ”
“ ‘The Shtile, Mary,’ an’ ‘The Wearin’ uv
the Green,’ an’ ‘Musha a-ding-dong-da’! Goon-
diwindi, sing you all the day and night.”
“I will that.” said the Bad Man, and in-
continently burst into song.
Mr. Trant went to bed early that night,
but not to sleep; for in the next room sang
! °Tf . the , Rad Man : Paying himself for the
old insult and all unconsciously earning
himself a new one.
* * * *
vr Sf >. Goondiwindi secured Dishonorable
Mention. Denny and Aloysius McShane
agreed that editor Trant had cut himself
oil from the congregation, and delivered him-
self into the hands of the Bad Alan. In
t i week’s _ issue of the Quartpot Argus
Mr. Trant intolerantly reviewed the Aus-
tralian bushman. and especially the Austra-
lian drover, and most particularly Goondi-
windi, in a sub-leader. Wrote Mr."Trant:
We have definitely taken our stand against public
disturbance, and now name the uncouth person who
ruils himself the Bad Man from Goondiwindi....
Knowing that Australians and particularly Drovers
and Bushmen are without the advantages of Uni-
versity training, we wish to overlook their faults:
incontrovertible that the doings that have
disgraced Quartpot since this person came would
never be tolerated in any community at Home. What
are the police doing?
Denny read it again, smiling at Aloysius
McShane; and then, following McShane's
glance, he saw that it rested on the Bad
Man from Goondiwindi making an uncertain
passage from the hotel to the newspaper
office and going forth to war.
Into the Argus office strode the Bad Man,
halted at the printing-room, saw a match-
board partition and a door marked “Private,”
and made it public by throwing the door open
so violently that its hinges creaked. Seated
behind the table was Mr. Trant, B.A. (Oxon),
paling as he saw the visitor.
“You printed a flamin’ lot o’ lies about me
in the flamin’ rag,” began the Bad Man.
“I decline to converse with you,” faltered
Trant.
"No conversin’. I’ll do all the talkin’ an’
all the doin’. 1” flamin’ immigrant! Tellin'
me not ter sing! . Why, damn y’, I’ll tear
y’ hide off yer head an’ nail it ter yer heels.
I'll brand y’ from y’ hocks to your crest an'
then fake the brands. I’ll”
And then, temporarily at a loss for words,
the Bad Man lifted the table and upset it
over the editor, and the editor escaped to
the printing-office and dodged the Bad Man
around the imposing surface, whereon lay
the type of two pages of the Argus, still in
their columns, but unprotected by their
chases. The Bad Man, recovering his speech
in all its fulness, breathed horrible threats
against the dodging Trant, and suddenly
pressing a hand on each of the footsticks of
the pages pushed a hundredweight or so of
solid and display type over Trant’s legs and
feet. Uttering little yelps of fear, the editor
ran into the street, and the Bad Man would
have caught him only that the Bad Man
tripped on the steps of the ex-church and
fell. That gave Trant the lead, and he ran
like a beagle to the hotel, the pursuing Bad
Man roaring threats of battle, murder and
sudden death.
“I got me spurs on, an’ I’ll get me saddle
an’ bridle, an’ ride yer thro’ the prickly-pear
to Mungindi,” he roared.
With the promise of ignominious torture in
his ears, Trant reached the door of his room,
locked himself in, and sat down panting,
gradually recovering calmness and immedi-
ately becoming indignant again. Indignation
turned back to fear when he heard his door
tried, and he congratulated his foresight in
locking it.
Stealthy footsteps sounded in retreat from
his door. He heard the door of the next
room opening, and knew that the Bad Man
had entered therein. The next door closed.
Trant heard the ring of metal on metal, the
noise of a man crossing the room, the creak
of the bed as the man stood upon it. And
then Trant looked up and saw the head and
arms and upper body of Goondiwindi showing
over the partition that stopped at the spring
of the eaves. In his right hand the Bad Man
held a horse's bridle. “B. A. Oxen,” said
the Bad Man, as if distraught with rage.
‘You an’ me’s both in the cattle business. " I
got me spurs on, an’ I’ll bridle and saddle
you, and ride you through the prickly-pear to
Mungindi.”
The illustration of the bridle was enough.
Trant ran to the door, unlocked it and sped
out of the hotel by the back door, and ran
up the side lane to Denny Deneen’s.
The Bad Man’s face relaxed. Tie lay down
on his bed, listening to the fear expressed
by Trant in his escape, and laughed with
great heartiness.
“What he says he means,” said Denny
“Mr. Thrant, Ink at here! He’s not called the
Bad Man from Goondiwindi for nothin’.”
“But you said life was harmless.”
“Ah yes. ah yes! Until lie’s roused. An'
then he’d do what he said. Devil doubt him.”
“He had the bridle with him, and his
spurs on.”
“His saddle’s in the harness-room convay-
nient.”
“I think I’ll leave you, Mr. Deneen.”
Tis best. I’ll pay your fare an’ an
extr.v week. There’s a fruit train by-u'-bye.
An’ there’s your money.”
“I suppose I wouldn’t suit the place, Mr.
Deneen ?”
“It isn’t that —the place wouldn’t suit you,
Mr. Thrant.”
“The insulting fellow called me B. A.
Oxen and said I was a cattleman like him-
self.”
“He’s a bad man is the Bad Man, an’
what lie says he means.”
“But to threaten to ride a man through
the prickly-pear! It’s against the law.”
“No! No! There’s no law protectin'
prickly-pear. Nobody would care what
Goondiwindi did to prickly-pear. And it’s
only four hundred miles to Mungindi.”
Mr. Trant was about to suggest that ho
was not solicitous for the pricklv-pear. but
he refrained, and withdrew to pack his be-
longings and depart from Quartpot.
It was but coincidence that as he made his
exit from the hotel the Bad Man from Goon-
diwindi appeared from the harness-room He
was spurred, and carried a bridle in his hand
and a saddle on his shoulder.
Mr. Trant took firmer grip of his suitcase
handles, and quickened his pace towards the
railway station. Seeing which the Bad Man
laughed again and jiroceeded to the horse
paddock.
* * * *
, B. A. Oxon have gone back 'to
\\ indshor Castle,” said Denny. “An’ now.
Bringalily, ye are the editor, and ye’ll write
friendly like ye speak, an’ people will buy
Jhe Argusht to hear you yarnin’. An’,
Micky, ye would like to be a reporther-
man ?”
“Too right! I’d love it,” said Miekv.
But ye won’t leave off doin’ the boots an’
the chooks, an’ the pigs, an’ the cow, a-
mornin’s, Micky?”
“Bet your life, no.”
“An’ y’r gettin’ thirty-nine shillin’s an’
slnxpence a week, an’ a punkin’ Sathurday
nights, Micky?”
“Yes! I don’t want no wages for the
paper.”
“But ’tis wages ye’ll have, Micky. Fifty-
nine shillin’s an’ shixpence, Micky, ‘for all ye
do. an’ two punkins Sathurdays.”
“Do me all right.”
“No thanks have ye, Micky? Ye scut!”
“Can’t get thanks an’ work too,” said the
very Australian Micky. “I give yer work,
don’t I?”
“Yes, Micky. An’, Bringalily, next week
see ye have a good mintion of Goondiwindi.”
So Quartport proceeded to the journalism
it understood.

It is fitted with a 2|-h.p. engine, which develops more than sufficient power
both to propel the machine and operate the cutter, thus requiring only one attendant
for guiding purposes.
The running cost of an ‘‘ATOQ,” thanks to the scientific precision of its
construction, is remarkably low. An operator can very easily and completely
cut 1000 square yards of turf on a fuel consumption of a quarter-pint of petrol
and oil mixture.
A twin silencer and an extra exhaust pipe (turned sideways to avoid annoy-
ance to operator) ensure extra quiet running of engine.
