THE RED PAGE.
A POET AND A POET
TO Gilbert Murray’s work one looks with
peculiar interest, for his first breath drew
Australian air. Even one may argue an
Australian taste in his preference of Eu-
ripides to iEschylus. The “ Hippolytus ” and
“ Bacchte ” he gave us last year in a rhyming
translation ; the “ Trojan Women ” v -is just to
hand ; and “Electra ”is coming. His version of
the “ Trojan Women ” is a noble piece of work, a
book shining with beauty. In this play Euripides
gave grief a voice, and Murray rises and matches
him in a new tongue. Of a great poem he has
made a great poem.
How much and how many the loss of Troy
has inspired ! how art has ennobled the myth !
Euripides, one of the first, has seen and shaped
his subject as only genius can. Troy has
fallen; Priam is dead, and the mighty Hector;
and the Greeks, their evil mission accom-
plished, are about to embark for their own
land, bearing with them the Trojan women
as captives. There is a period of suspense when
tbe Greeks are making ready to sail, and the
women wait their pleasure beneath the ruined
walls of the city. In the dusk of early dawn the
gods of fallen Troy appear and introduce the play.
Then, as the day comes, Hecuba wakes, the widow
of the slain monarch. Her and the others Murray
interprets, following his master in felicitous mea-
sures (which one thinks, but for Swinburne, would
not have been precisely what they are). Beautiful
lines and verses abound :
I that was Queen in Troy i
He loved her for that same strange holiness.
For tears are music too, and keep
A song unheard in hearts that weep.
... No wife came
With gentle arms to shroud the limbs of them
For burial, in a strange and angry earth
Laid dead.
0,1 will think of things gene long ago
And weave them to a song, like one more tea.-
In the heart of misery.
The lovely word Troy, that B-ossetti appre-
ciated, gives help. Occasionally Murray uses one
of Tennyson’s familiar devices: the overflow on
a strong word.
... and there at the altar Priam fell
Murdered, and round him all his citadel
Sacked.
J*
In the play Hecuba’s splendid wail—
Take this slave that once trod high
In Ilion ; cast her on her bed of clay
Rock-pillowed, to lie down, and pass away
Wasted with tears. And what so man they call
Happy, believe not ere the last day fall l
—is followed by a finely-planned version of the
chant of the chorus. Presently Andromeda, wife
of Hector, mingles her tears with those of Hecuba,
his mother :
Hf.c. Troy, Troy is gone !
And. Yea, and her treasure parted.
Hro. Gone, gone, mine own
Children, the noble-hearted !
And. Sing, sorrow...
Hko. For me, for me t
And. Sing for the Great City,
That falleth, falleth to be
A shadow, a fire departed.
And. Come to me, omy lover l
Hsc. The dark shroudeth him over,
My flesh, woman, not thine, not thine !
And. Make of thine arms my cover.
And Hecuba sings :
0 thou whose wound was deepest.
Thou that my children keepest,
Priam, Priam, 0 age-worn King,
Gather me where thou sleepest.
At p. 47 the speech of Andromache —
Forgive met It is not easy—
should surely be oredited to Talthybius ? He, the
herald, comes to take from Andromache her little
child Astyanax, whom the Greeks have ordered to
be thrown from the wall of Troy. Says Andro-
mache :
Weepest thou ?
Nay, why, my little one t Thou canst not know.
And Father will not come ; he will not come ;
Not once, the great spear flashing, and the tomb
Riven to set thee free !
Soon the chorus gives Murray an opportunity to
ose the singing measure which he handles so ad-
mirably. Then comes Menelaus seeking Helen, the
origin of evil. ‘‘He is a prey to violent and conflict-
ing emotions,” says Murray in a phrase that has
been made impossible in Australia since the egre-
gious Meagher, “ coming from Bondi in the tram,
was torn asunder with conflicting emotions.” Helen
defends herself, and Hecuba attacks her, in a
Seat scene finely rendered. It is curious to find
ecuba urging that Helen was a willing prey,
with the argument that appeals to modern police-
courts :
It was by force my son
Took thee, thou sayst, and striving... Yet not one
In Sparta knew ! No cry, no sudden prayer
Rang from thy rooms that night. .. Castor was there
To hear thee, and his brother : both true men,
Not yet among the stars !
That is, their evidence was still available if Helen
pressed a defence. The chorus takes up the tale ;
Talthybius returns with the body of the child
Astyanax ; and Hecuba utters immemorial grief :
Ah, what a death hath found thee, little one !
Hadst thou but fallen fighting, hadst thou known
Strong youth and love and all the majesty
Of godlike kings, then had toe spoken of thee
As of one blessed.. .could, in any wise
These days know blessedness. But now thine eyes
Have seen, thy lips have tasted, but thy soul
No kncnvledge had nor usage of the whole
Rich life that lapt thee roy/nd Poor little child !
Was it our ancient wall, the circuit piled
By loving Gods, so savagely hath rent
Thy curls, these little flowers innocent
That were thy mother's garden, where she laid
Her kisses ; here, just where the bone-edge f rayed
Grins white above—Ah heaven, I will not see !
Ye tender arms, the same dear mould have ye
As his ; haw from the shoulder loose ye drop
And weak! And dear proud tips, so full of hope
And closed for ever ! ' What false words ye said
At daybreak, when he crept into my bed,,
Called me kind names, and promised : ‘ Grandmother,
When thou art dead, I will cut close my hair,
And lead out all the captains to ride by
Thy tomb.' Why didst thou cheat, me so ? 'T is /,
Old, homeless, childless, that for thee must shed
Cold, tears, so young, so miserably dead.
Dear God, the pattering welcomes of thy feet,
The nursing in my lap ; and O, the sweet
Falling asleep together! All is gone.
Then comes one of the characteristic touches of
“our Euripides the human.” Hecuba shrouds
the small body in the garments which she had
treasured, as women will, for a wedding-gift.
Glory of Phrygian raiment, which my thought
Kept for thy bridal day with some far-sought
Queen of the East, folds thee for evermore.
A crash is heard, and the wall of great Troy
falls. The trumpet sounds again, and the women
go out in the darkness to the ships.
A ad forth, 10, the women go,
The crown of War, the crown of Woe,
To bear the children of the foe
And weep, weep, for Ilion !
• —i ♦
N.B.W. PUBLIC LIBRARY
THE perfunctory and ignorant enquiry of
N.S.W. Public Works Committee, re-
garding the site and building of a new
Public Library, was designed apparently
to give the semblance of official sanction to a cut-
and-dried conclusion. The action of Premier
Carruthers in procuring Parliamentary approval
of the Committee’s conclusion, after some hours’
perfunctory and ignorant debate, wore the sinister
air that has attached to other public actions of
Premier Carruthers. It appears from the news-
paper reports, which alone are available at this
writing, that he gave the Assembly no definite in-
formation regarding the character and conditions
of the Mitchell gift. As regards its value, he is
reported to have said that this would approxi-
mate 200,000?. In the absence of other evidence,
one must suppose that he believes this. In the
absence of other evidence, one must suppose that
he is foolish to believe it.
The value of the Mitchell gift can be tested in
two ways : by ascertaining its cost to the donor,
or by the estimate of experts. So far as the
public knows, neither test has been applied. If
one assumes from the limited information avail-
able that the collection cost 20,000?., then its cash
value is possibly 20,000?. If it were sold under
the best conditions, one is extremely doubtful
whether it would realise more. If the donor paid
20,000?. within the last twenty years, one is
extremely doubtful whether the cash value will
double during the next twenty years. For the
items of the collection apparently have a varying
commercial value and little intrinsic value.
J*
Apparently they have for Australians a senti-
mental value due to their curios 'ty and rarity. That
value, though it may be considerable, is still
limited ; and certainly does not add 180,000?. to
the value of the gift. “It is said” that the
donor purposes adding a money endowment. In
that case, particulars should be given. Why
should Parliament be asked to vote public money
on false or imaginary or insufficient data ? Why
should a transaction honourable and profitable be
completed furtively and hurriedly ?
The Assembly appears vaguely to have believed
that it was voting for the public benefit; and the
bait of a financial bargain was attached —as one
believes, falsely. For a building adequate to con-
tain the Mitchell gift could be erected (according
to the estimate of an authoritative Telegraph
contributor) for 10,000?. ; and the building
authorised may cost 125,000?. or more. 10,000?.
for 20,000?. is a good investment; 125,000?. for
20,000?. is not. And if this hypothetical criticism
blunder for lack of data, how much more serious
a blunder was the Assembly vote, similarly lack-
ing data ?
Jt
The public benefit from the Mitchell gift, apart
from its cash value, is a doubtful thing. The gift
is spoken of as a library : it is rather a museum of
antiquities. Public expenditure on antiquities
should be governed by their value in relation to
national life, and this really is very small. For
hundreds of years to come the material develop-
ment of Australia will be far more important than
the accumulation of literary curiosities: it will
always be more important. Literary curiosities
are proper subjects of private pleasure, but their
national value is slight. One grudges the expen-
diture upon them of public money badly needed
for the promotion of industry and enlightenment.
F. M. Bladen, a N.S.W. public librarian, re-
cently printed a laborious essay devoted to ascer-
taining upon what precise rock in Botany Bay
Captain Cook first set foot. The riddle is a pro-
per amusement for learned leisure, but it has no
public importance whatever. It does not matter
a scrap where Captain Cook landed, or whether
he never landed at all. What does matter is
that there is a ragged woman sweltering under an
iron shed at Bourke, whose children are sickening
for want of wholesome food. Similarly, the
MS. of Captain Cook’s journal is an interesting
curiosity; but if he had never kept a journal Aus-
tralia would suffer no loss whatever. Loss comes
when a despairing farmer loses his year’s labour
for want of an artificial water supply to supple-
ment insufficient rainfall.
Some members of Parliament and others are
apt to regard books as fetishes. Just as the
devout of the Dark Ages worshipped alleged
feathers from the wing of the Archangel Michael,
so the devout of the Dark Ages worship first folios
of Shakespear. Such things have private interest,
but no public value unless they exist for enlighten-
ment. Books, in particular, have several uses : as
a drug for life’s pains, or as an addition to
life’s pleasures, or as an inspiration to life’s
battle for life. It is only in the last mode
that they become of serious importance in
the scale of national values. The Mitchell museum,
it may be assumed, is no fountain of inspiration.
It may fairly be doubted whether it will help
one citizen to live more nobly or to die more
bravely. That it contains material valuable
for the study of Australian history is undoubted,
and the study of Australian history is of the very
least importance in national life. Boys and girls
can be taught in a month all they need to know
of it: all that will be of the least help in making
them useful citizens. For strong bodies and
enlightened minds we depend upon lessons in
far different fields. Not to museums, but to the
common schools of the country, should public
money be devoted.
Jf
The Mitchell gift is a splendid gift, to be ac-
cepted gratefully and housed fitly. But the pre-
cise nature, value, and conditions of the gift
should be ascertained before Parliament votes
(borrowed !) money on apparently a dispropor-
tionate scale, for expenditure on a plan and a site
which are not plainly the best available.
RECENT BOOKS
Wild Wings, by H. K. Job (Lond., Constable;
10s. 6d.), describes “the adventures of a camera-hunter
among' the larger wild birds of North America on sea and
land,” and makes a handsome volume in small 4to, with
160 photographic illustrations. One does not suppose
the book will appeal to more Australians than a few, but
these are likely to delight in it. The author’s enthusiasm
is transparently sincere, and sincerity is essential nowa-
days, when the vogue of “ nature-study ” brings to light
so much deliberate enthusiasm, such a flood of senti-
mentality laboriously pumped. The photographs are
especially charming. Such a book of Australian birds and
animals would be welcome.
A. & H. Constable, London, publish several
Dovels transferred from the U.S.A. The Colonel’s
Dream, by C. W. Chesnutt (2s. 6 d.), is the story of a man
who tried to enlighten and benefit an Amer. township,
and was beaten by the forces of meanness, ignorance, and
prejudice, rampant in small Amer. townships as else-
where. The interest is especially American, and the book
has no remarkable value.
In Rose o’ The River (2s. 6 d.) K. D. Wiggin writes a con-
ventional love story, without any arresting quality. This
is another book with a particular Amer. appeal unfelt
elsewhere.
It seems as if in The Little Shepherd John Pox, jr.,
wrote the only story he has to tell. A Cumberland
Vendetta (3s. 6rf.) recurs to the idea of the family feud in
which hero and heroine are on opposite sides. The slight
story is sufficiently well told, but has no particular im-
portance. , , ,
The Reckoning, by R. W. Chambers (2s. 6 d.), has a form
now too stereotyped to enchant us. The period is that
of the Amer. War of Independence, with the lady and her
lover thrown again into hostile camps, and a new shibbo-
leth, Thendara ! used as Lorraine ! was used in a former
story. Mechanically the book is well handled, and the
epoch affords ample colour. The heroine has the pleasant
individuality of Chambers’s heroines : she is like the others,
with a formal difference. On the whole, however, there is
a loss of gaiety and novelty, and the book does not enthrall.
A fresh story and good, to be commended highly, is The
Comihg of the Tide, by Margaret Sherwood (25. 6d.) The
author does not acknowledge previous work, and if this
be her beginning it is a beginning worth while. The atti-
tude is new, the style excellent; and the story holds one
until the last chapter, where, alas, it is wrecked upon an
unconvincing crisis. “0 ! ” says the author, “if Swin-
burne had not been Swinburne what sealike poems he
might have written ! ”
The Toll of the Bush, by W. Satehell (Lond.,
Macmillan ; 2s. 6 d.), is a graphic story of Maoriland, with
some powerful dramatic passages ; in particular, the story
of the fire. As a novel, the book fails for want of a strong
and shapely plot.
The Last Chance, by “ Rolf Boldrewood ”
(Lond., Macmillan ; 2s. 6 d.), is an extraordinary concoc-
tion of Australian and English impressions—a cinemato-
graph of the author’s mind up to the date of this year’s
war, with Bully Hayes elbowing selected verses from
ordsworth, and Australian mining experience salted by
criticism of Sir Walter Scott. All the surplusage
trimmed from previous books seems to have found its
way into the mixture, which is not without excellent
irrelevancies.
The late Anna Swan wick’s version of Faust is
republished in the “ York Library ” (Lond., Bell; 25. 6 d.
net)- The translator was not heaven-born, and work like
Gilbert Murray’s puts us out of conceit with her. Faust,
indeed, still wants an English interpreter, and is worth
him : one fears it will not be “ her.” After all argument
the law remains : you must not make of a good poem a
bad one ; which amounts to saying that in metrical trans-
lation literality must yield to beauty. People who must
be literal may have prose, but in verse the most beautifu
paraphrase is the best version. Miss Swan wick is solic
and conscientious, but... she is so sadly uninspired I
What can one say of this?—
And, as waned my strength, no longer
Rolled the sea upon the shore :
Prudent lords, bold serfs directing,.
It with trench and dyke restrained ;
Or this :
Baucis, to my lips half-dying,
Art thou, who refreshment gave t
Thou Philemon, strength who plying,
Snatched my treasure from the wave i
The translation swarms with such clumsy inversions.
The famous ending of the second part appears thus :
All of mere transient date,
As symbol showeth :
Here, the inadequate
To fulness groweth ;
Here the ineffable
Wrought is in love ;
The ever-womanly
Draws us above.
How is it possible for a reader, ignorant of the original,
to gather from this the original spirit ? Yet one must add
that, brooded upon, Miss Swanwick’s dogged consci-
entiousness does yield a certain flavour ; and through her
glass darkly Goethe can be seen. The present edition is
prefaced by Karl Breul with advantage.
Walter Jerrold’s Charles Lamb (in Bell’s
“Miniature Series,” Is. net) is succinct and adequate on
its scale. Between too-much and nob-enough Jerrold has
hit the happy mean. His account of Lamb’s life is read-
able : his criticism, without being remarkable, is just;
and he gives many hints for readers’ own extension.
The little book is bettered by the illustrations, including
two portraits and a reproduction of a letter in Lamb’s
handwriting. A chronological list of works is added, and
a reference to the chief books to consult.
The Physical Configuration of the Australian
Continent, by Ernest Favenc (Syd.; Brooks), is a short
essay adequately represented by its title, and published
as a booklet. As the pn face states, “the feature is the
maps,” which are interesting and useful. The relief-n.aps
suggest the question whether the original models are
covered by the Commonwealth Copyright Bill; and the
answer is doubtful.
Hubert Bland, author of With the Eyes of a Man
(Lond., Laurie ; 3s. 6 d.), earns affinity with Australia
through his wife, E. Ncsbit, a distinguished writer of
verse. This volume contains a series of essays, apparently
reprinted from Lond. Sunday Chronicle. The subjects
are modern and interesting : sex and heredity, beauty
and G. B. Shaw ; and the author’s ideas are modern,
though here not novel. His style, however, is too
smooth, its pace too slow for an Australian taste: he
shoots his arrows dexterously, but they lack points and
barbs to pierce and hold.
The House by the River, by Florence Warden
(Lond., Unwin, 3s. 6ef.), shows what may happen to a
typewriting girl if she is pretty enough and good enough.
A handsome young man will fall in love to her, according
to the Law of Gravitation ; but that is not all. She may
walk suddenly into the middle of the most exciting melo-
drama, where strange scoundrels scutter about like cock-
roaches, and stimulating outrages rise like coffee-fumes
from elegant suburban “grounds.” One supposes that
the emotions and colours are violent, but one supposes
that many people will not mind. Tim pretty typewriter
is almost persuaded to come to Australia, when she must
come with a convicted villain of the piece ; but when the
handsome, tall, noble, intellectual young man embraces
his own on the last page they go to. ..Canada. Here is a
nice adjustment of colonial valuations.
In Helena (Edin., Blackwood; 2s. 6 d.) Mrs.
H. O. Forbes writes a story of Maoriland which may
interest Christchurch people. Our interest was lost in
the scrub of insignificant observations that crowd the

In The Westminster Gazette were recently
printed twelve chapters on education, bv
£ Kappa,” under the title “ If Youth But Knew ”
The matter is so good that surely it will be re-
printed, and should then be bought by all i n .'
terested in education.
“Why should not youth know?” asks the writer.
“Why should its best years be portioned outbatween
dead task-work and idle child’s-play, both seeming deliber-
ately calculated to conceal from it the splendour and the
mystery of this strange adventure of life, on which, for a
little space, it is embarked ? We are given some two or
three score years to enjoy the pageant of the universe
and contemplate the miracle of existence ; and we let our
ingenuous youth waste their intelligence on dismal
pedantries and their admiration on despicable trifles.*
And he goes on: 1
“ I believe that the efficiency, the morality, and above
all the happiness of coming generations might be inoal.
eulably promoted by a radical change in our system of
education. I believe that the conscious and deliberate
aim of education should be to enable a man, in the fullest
sense of the word, to enjoy life ; and that the enjoyment
of life, for anyone who has time and means to cultivate
his intelligence, is partly, no doubt, dependent on the
gratification of physical appetite and the exertion of
physical energy, but far more essentially and permanently
on the intellectual apprehension of the sublimities and
jn.vsteries of the universe and of the human lot.
“ What, then, is the fundamental task of a liberal edu-
cation ? What should be its constant endeavour ? Surely
to awaken and to keep ever alert the faculty of wonder in
the human sou 1 . To take life as a matter of course—
whether painful or pleasurable—that is the true spiritual
death. From the body of that death it is the task of .edu-
cation to deliver us.” \
Longman's Magazine expires formally of mani-
tion and Andrew Lang : it died spiritually years ago.
The editor’s farewell attributes decease to his high
literary standard ; but in our view it is precisely because
his standard was not high that his magazine died. His
policy was partly a policy of “ names,” and even the
English public seems learning to disregard names and ask
for values. Because Andrew Lang was a bright writer
twenty years ago, he has been allowed to be tedious
month after month, and to lead a faded cohort to a battle
where they always fell before they saw the enemy. Ail
the vitality having been fogied out of the magazine, its
obvious course was to lie down.
Maori land correspondence prophesies more
power to Seddon’s elbow. In one aspect we do not
grudge it, for he has given us two good moments. One
came when he closed a robust oratorical period with this
phrase :
“ The Mother Country will always find New Zealand her
ihs-a-vis, following close behind her.” -jit.
The other flashed when he clinched an argument with
this simile unparalleled :
“It is like a man who fancies he is riding, a nors-ae-
combat when he is astride on a miserable nag.”
To the fifth number of Art and Architecture,
G. Sydney Jones contributes both the best article and
the best drawing. He pleads for an original note in Aus-
tralian architecture, and urges his brethren not to be
content with copying the work of the past :
“We have a fine and costly building, for instance, in
the Art Gallery [N.S.W.] Its general form and composi-
tion are good, and its detail is refined, but the whole might
have been done vastly better, both in form and detail,
centuries since bv a Greek or a Roman architect ; for it is
designed almost wholly in the spirit of Greek and Roman
work. Even the detail in parts— e.g., ihe main entrance
doorway, is as nearly as possible the 'opy of a Grees
doorway. Do not misunderstand me, not for one moment
would I decry the work, which as a design is admirable,
hut as a piece of modern architecture I submit that it
fails, simply because it is not modern.
A fragment of.Char’es Lamb, quoted by a
reviewer of the last biography ;
“ I have made a little scale,” says Charles, “ supposing
myself to receive the following various, accessions of dig-
nity from the King, who is the fountain of honour:—As
at first, 1, Mr. C. Lamb ; 2, 0, Lamb, Esq. ; 3, Sir C. Lamb,
Bart. ; 4, Baron Lamb of Stamford, where my family came
from —I have chosen that if ever I should have my °hoice ,
5, Viscount Lamb ; 6, Earl Lamb ; 7, Marquis Lamb; 6,
Duke Lamb. It would look like quibbling bo carry it on
further, and especially as it is not necessary for children
to go beyond the ordinary titles of sub-regal dignity in
our own countrv, otherwise I have sometimes m my
dreams imagined myself still advancing, as, 9th, King
Lamb; 10th, Emperor Lamb; 11th, Pope
higher than which there is nothing but the Lamb ot goq.

Model 1905 Self-Loading Rifle
This rifle is a six shot, hammerless take-down, made in .32 and .35 calibers,
the cartridges being of the modern smokeless powder type. The recoil of
the exploded cartridge ejects the empty shell, cocks the hammer and feeds
a fresh cartridge from the magazine into the chamber, leaving the rifle ready
to shoot upon the operator’s pulling the trigger. The self-loading system
adds much to the pleasure of rifle shooting, either at target or game. The
list price of this model is $28.00.

HANS PETER RASMUSSEN,
LEICHHARDT TESTIMONY.
EVERY LOCALITY SENDS ITS TRIBUTE.
The Case of Mrs. A. YOUNC.
(By a Sydney Reporter.)
The principal feature for us of the
stories of adversity which have .been
the lot of others is that they g iv ? »
clue to the manner in which similar
experiences can be effectively dealt with
if they come our way. Here is a nar-
rative which will assuredly put many a
reader on the right track—one supplied
to us by Mrs. Annie Young, ot Myrtle-
street, Leichhardt. It was at Mrs.
Young’s present address, where she has
been living for the past eleven yeais,
that our special . correspondent was
granted the interview which appears
prpnnupr *——
“I’m in search of news,’’ said the
newspaper man. “Do you mind letting
me know something’ about tne altijc-
tions you encountered whilst living in
Bay-street, Glebe? where .you
were living at the time, I’m told !
“Yes,'*’ answered Mrs. Young ; ‘and
it is thirteen years since I had the ill-
ness you refer to. Truly, the time does
My. It doesn’t seem half so long ago,
tor everything is as fresh in my me-
mory as though it was only yester-
day. Oh ! .1. was unwell for a good
while. Hardly knew what to do from
one (lay to another owing to the leeble
condition . I was in. Times being so
bad I could not afford to keep a ser-
vant, yet I was quite unable to get
about and do the work myself, and the
consequence was that things had to
take their chance.’ 7
“Were you experiencing any physical
pain ?’’
“Oh ! don’t talk ab<put it. Have you
ever had neuralgia in the head ? I
hope not, for it was something dread-
ful. Right across the forehead,
through ,from one temple to the other,
and up to the top of mv head, the
most acute pain imaginable harassed
me. The agony was so great that of-
ten 1 imagined something was pressing-
on my brain, and I really used to
think I .would go mad with it. It had
such an effect upon me, indeed, that
even my sight went bad, and as for the
feeling in my eyes—well, they felt as if
they were double the size they should
have been. Ah ! what desolate, me-
lancholy days they were ! Km sure 1
felt myself to be about the most un-
happy woman in tho world, and I
think I had occasion to be in view of
the fact that the outlook was so
black.’’
“Do you mean that your prospects
of getting strong again seemed re-
mote ?’’
‘■They did, indeed, for I had been at-
tended to by several doctors, and the
most they could do for me was to give
just a little relief now and then ; but
there was nothing lasting about it.
and if I felt a trifie better one day I
was sure to feel ten times worse the
next, and the medicine, besides being
so ineffective, was always disagreeable
to take. A strange thing was that I
felt always so worn out, drowsy and
exhausted—as if I was only lit to go
somewhere and lie down and die—yet
when .1 made an effort to sleep, do you
think I could? Not a bit of it. I’d
twist and turn nearly the whole night
through, and when at last T dozed off
the dreams I had were fearful. T al-
ways appeared to be struggling against
something that was holding me in its
clutches, hideous sights flitted through
my imaginative brain, and when I
woke up, which was usually with a
s t ar . t ’, L felt terribly agitated and
a raid Really, I used to dislike tho
idea of going t,o sleep on account of
those dreams ; besides. I never felt
rested afterwards, as T got up feeling
more weary than ever. No wonder [
thought I would never get stroncr
again, for I got absolutely no benefit
whatever from any food T took. Soon
after eating J suffered dreadfully t ro m
flatulence, the wind rising* from the
stomach, and leaving a sour taste that
was similar to the disagreeable flavour
I had in my mouth each morning ;
then, a little later, my chest becama
painful and uncomfortable, with a feel-
ing as it a stone had got inside, and
had closed up the breathing passages,
for when I tried to take a long breath
it hurt me."
"And you couldn’t get permanent re-
lief from these symptoms through the
medicine prescribed for you Y"
".No, unfortunately. But linally I got
something to do me good. Clements
Tonic it was, and the best remedy I
ever had in all my life, too. Good-
ness, what a show it made of every-
thing else 1 had taken, for instead of
only easing me a little occasionally, it
went right to the base of my iniirmi-
ties, and lifted them out by the roots !
In addition to what I’ve already told
you, 1 must state that I was highly
nervous—nobody could be more so, for
1 was actually afraid to stay in my
own house by myself, and was con-
tinually worrying myself about things
that 1 imagined were going to happen.
Trouble was always hanging over me,
and I couldn’t get the idea out of my
head—not until I had been taking Cle-
ments Tonic for a space of time, when,
quite mysteriously, I ceased brooding
over such silly things, and my mind
became as happy as the day. Oh ! it
was wonderful what an altered woman
Clements Tonic made me. Instead of
being anxious and timid all day, I got
as happy and cheerful as possible—no-
thing frightened me, and my nerves
were steady. It is because I know of
so many nervous women that I deem
it my duty to say what a splendid re-
medy Clements Tonic is for that com-
plaint, though, for that matter, it was
equally beneficial to me in other ways.
I used to get pains down the small of
my back and about my shoulders, al-
so palpitation and pains in the region
of the heart, which made me think
that something very serious was
wrong with me there : but Clements
Tonic showed itself to be such a pain-
removing medium that I can faithfully
recommend it to all sufferers. Its re-
gulating influences on the heart were
extraordinary, and for making one’s
sleep sound and peaceful, the same re-
medy was the only one to meet with
my requirements. I wish I had used it
months before, for plenty of people
told me what a grand medicine Clef,
ments Tonic was, and—"
"How did you come to use it at
last ?’’
"I was laid up at the time, thin,
pale, and despairing, when I suddenly
thought of it,'and I asked a friend to
get some. She did ; I regained my
health and strength through its in-
fluence over me, and thus my worldly
happiness was restored. JN'ever as long
as T live shall I forget what a good,
regular appetite Clements Tonic gave
me ; how it stopped the giddy sensa-
tions that had troubled me from com-
ing back ; and how effectively it ended
my tormenting head and body pains.
The least I can do is to assist my
neighbours to throw off their afflic-
tions, so you may publish my experi-
ences in any manner you like."

Paudheen’s Fairy.
Paudlieen took leave of
His comrades gay,
Upon the eve of
The first of May ;
With heart undaunted
He trod the path
Unto the haunted
Green Fairy Rath.
Sore wept his mother.
“ Avic ! Machree !
Where was another
Son dear as he ?
He’s gone for ever !
Too well I know
The fairies never
Will let him go.”
The wind went soughin’
Across the land;
A branch of rowan
Was in her hand ;
Witch-ha/.els bended
Their shadows lean.
Her cry ascended —
“Paudlieen ! Paudlieen !”
It was the night, and
The charmed hour,
When elf and sprite and
Queen Meeve have power.
Was it, perchance, heard,
That cry so keen ?
The lone hill answered,
“Paudlieen ! Paudlieen !”
But Paudlieen, lying
On magic ground.
Of that sore crying
Heard not a sound—-
For, through the springing
Green grass, rose clear
A sound of singing
Most sweet to hear.
No wild, marsli-firisli,
Witch-chant he heard,
But kindly Irish
Was every word.
The strain rose reeling—-
He heard, the rogue,
The song, heart-stealing,
Of Tir-nan-oyc.
The corn was springing
Where once was loam —
When, softly singing,
Paudheen came home
His step was airy,
His lips apart—
The Singing Fairy
Was in Ins heart.

Aden.
She joined the ship at Aden, whence the mad-
boats march phalanxed,
With the standards of all nations trailing from
their spurning spars;
She joined the ship at Aden, and a thrill ran
through each crank’s head
And went throbbing, throbbing, throbbing up
toward the steadfast stars !
She came aboard at sunset when the dust hung
over Aden,
She was Egypt writ in woman —splendid Sheba’s
vivid charms;
She was frankincense incarnate —she was fire-and
passion laden —
An 1 the great red moon of Ismail saw her smiling
in my arms !
The Indian Ocean opened—its wide bosom spread
before us,
But we'd lost our souls at Aden, by the gates of
Pharaoh s Sea.
They were lost and gone like Isis and Osiris and
old Idorus,
But man needs no soul at Aden where it fries
eternally.

Excelsior.
I stood in an archway dimly vast, in the court of
the Halls of Day ;
And I saw the night on star-fringed wings, pass
swift to the west away ;
And the infant morn, like an opening flowi r, its
petals fair unfold,
Flushed with the light of a rosy dawn, and ba'hed
in a sea of gold.
And I thought of the men who slept and rose,
who toiled and worked and prayed,
And laid their spoils at the day’s decl.ne in the
fires their hands had made.
And I saw myself, with my petty aims, my puny
joys and fears,
Only one among millions more, in the mist of a
million years.
But I knew there were some with souls of fire, and
mighty hearts of love,
Who climbed from the plains of the commonplace
to the heights which tower above;
And there was a way and a place for each, though
the powers opposed were great,
But I was a child with empty hands, and a path-
way desolate.

WANTED-A GUN
At time of writing the Australian atmosphere is
full of reports about a despatch in which the
British Government has “ peremptorily ordered ”
Westralia to repeal the anti-Chinese clauses of
its Factories Act, on the ground that they are
“repugnant to the feelings of nations with which
Britain is at peace.” Exactly how peremptory
the despatch is no one save Premier Rason knows
just yet, but that is a matter of small import-
ance ; if the British attitude is not yet quite as
peremptory as it might be, it will doubtless expand
later on. To the unthinking there is something
wildly grotesque about the British view of things,
seeing that for months British subjects in the
Transvaal have been flogging and torturing thou-
sands of Chinese —the subjects of a nation with
which Britain is at peace —and have injured their
backs as well as their feelings; that they have
done this in a colony which is under direct
British rule, so that, as far as the responsi-
bility goes, the British Government was, and still
is, itself the illegal flogger and torturer ; and that
the British Government only gave up denying the
atrocities perpetrated on the subjects of an alleged
friendly nation when it found itself liable to be
drowned in a sea of popular execration if it con-
tinued to lie on behalf of the mine-owners of
Jo’burg. It doesn’t seem to be, even now, one-
tenth as peremptory over the illegal tortures of
Chinese in Africa as it is over the factory legis-
lation of Westralia, for the tortures and unlawful
punishments still continue. But the Chow-flog-
ging in Africa is intended to extract larger divi-
dends for England’s beloved German Jew, while
the Chinese factory legislation of Westralia is
only intended to prevent the white artisan of pure
British descent being starved out of his job.
Therefore, to those who know England, the posi-
tion is understandable enough. England exists
nowadays mostly for the German Jew.
* ♦ * *
But what Australia has to consider now is not
Britain’s attitude—at present, the German Jew
disease there seems to be incurable —but its own.
It has got a clear, broad, well-defined hint
that its White Australia policy is a house of cards
which may collapse at any moment. There isn’t
a gun behind it, and no great policy is worth any-
thing without a guti. The community which, situ-
ated as Australia is, declares in the teeth of Asia
that it will make its land a white man’s land needs
to have a fast-growing population to begin with.
It needs to be attracting desirable white immi-
grants wholesale—and seeing that Britain alone
sends out over 250,000 annually of its own race,
and that this country has also Western Canada
and the Western part of the United States to
draw from, there is no lack of material. It
needs to stop importing, and manufacture for it-
self under an ironclad tariff, and to cut up
the great coastal estates remorselessly, so as to
provide work and land for its own people and for
hordes of desirable white immigrants. It needs
to be able to put into the field at the shortest
notice at least 200,000 men, all well-armed and
reasonably well-trained ; and to possess a fleet at
least as good as that of Holland, with its 17 ser-
viceable fighting ships—a .fleet of its own which
will be here when it is wanted. It needs to pay
off its debt in time of peace, so that when war
comes it will have good credit to fall back upon,
and it requires to have itsjown arms factories, and
to build its two transcontinental railways, so that
it can shift its army—when it gets one—to the
point of danger, remote that may be. If
these things were done there would be a gun
behind the White Australia policy. At present
there is nothing behind it, and it commands no
respect accordingly.
* * * *
The “Mother Country” is a depressed old
parent these times. It knows that its army is
a mockery and a wreck, and it doesn’t know
how to make it better. It has a vague idea that
its navy, large as it is, is not too large to protect
the British isles themselves. Under its Freetrade
system and its nefarious land system it feels the
stress of foreign competition very keenly. It has
made one Asiatic alliance in its own defence, and
is probably fishing for another. It has no sym-
pathy worth mentioning with Australia’s desire to
preserve the White Race which has made the
empire; the land that the race sprang from
seems to be the one which values it least. It is
quite willing that the Englishman should be
ousted by Chinese in South Africa, by Chinese
and Japanese in Australia, &nd by Japanese in
Canada ; till the Anglo-Saxon supremacy shifts
definitely to the United States and the expansion
of the white Briton in his own empire becomes
impossible for want of space. It values India much
more than Australia because it directly governs
India and it doesn’t directly govern Australia.
It probably values the Japanese alliance more
than it values Australia because it thinks that
Japan will fight for it, and if Japan does fight for
it, that means a strong fleet and a million brown
soldiers. On the other hand, it feels sure that
Australia Would fight for it—with a handful of
soldiers and the superannuated gunboat Protector.
This country can’t hope for any cordial sympathy
with its White Australia policy merely because
that policy means the expansion and elevation
and strengthening of the British race ; the British
race counts for less in England now than the
dividends of the German Hebrews whose beaks
make a cool shade over Jo’burg. Australia must
needs win respect for its policy itself, and to
do that it wants people—2o,ooo,ooo of people—
and factories and ships, and close settlement,
and wealth of its own—and its own gun.
If the alliance of White Australia were worth
as much for defensive purposes as that of Japan,
Britain would have a respect for White Australia,
and would see new merits in its policy. If our
anti-Chinese laws were backed by a force which
could do any necessary argument with China
single-handed, these laws would wear a new aspect
of reasonableness in the opinion of the ruling
classes in London. To Britain just now any
policy is reasonable if it is backed by a big
friendly gun; John Bull even hangs a garland
of admiration and a halo of respect round the
horrible immorality of Japan for the sake of the
Jap’s fighting power. If Australia had a service-
able fleet and army, Britain would be ready and
willing to fight for Australia, and probably even
for the White Australia policy. It is one thing
to fight for a country which can do at least half
the work of suppressing the joint enemy, and
quite another to fight for one which can do little
or nothing, except, perhaps, supply the cause
of the quarrel. The White Australia policy,
if it had its own gun, would be as good an
excuse as any other on which to extinguish a
dangerous rival, even if Britain had no real
sympathy with the aspirations that lie behind
that policy. But men, money, and fighting
capacity are the only things that count. Australia
has sacrificed its industries, and consequently its
chance of raising a great industrial population,
because it wouldn’t be so beastly ungrateful as to
raise a High Tariff barrier against Britain, and, in
proportion to its population, it has been the best
customer Britain has on earth. It has also sacri-
ficed its chance of raising a great agricultural
population rather than compulsorily break up its
big estates —many of them English-owned. And,
in return, it is scoffed at in England for not having
a population. It pays a subsidy to the British
navy, as Britain asked it to do, instead of raising
a navy of its own, and it is only jeered at for its
defencelessness, and supplied in a grudging way
with a dead-beat squadron which is regarded as
good enough for such a place—a place that is
s icrificing its future rather than seriously offend
Britain’s commercial susceptibilities.
* * * *
The White Australia policy is just about the
greatest political idtal in the world’s history,
it aims at raising the only pure white nation to be
found out of Europe. It proposes to show the
world, for the first time since the days of the
primeval ape, a whole continent under one flag,
one people, and one Government. It grasps at
the last chance on earth to build up a new white
people ; there is no other place left where such a
people can be built up. It makes Australia the
vanguard of the white race and its most advanced
entrenchment the one that absolutely looks
into Shem’s greatest encampment, and which is
the furthest of all from possibility of white
assistance. And this policy, with all its vast
aspirations, and with its huge possibilities of
glory and of danger, is being worked out quite
casually, as if it were a small thing that might
• happen any day. The political party which is
mainly responsible for it refuses even to see that
it is necessary to raise industries and accumulate
population with feverish haste, and to heap
up guns in the white man’s most advanced
entrenchment, and to have something more than
a smattering of people, and an antiquated rifle or
two, and a few hired tin-kettle cruisers behind
the biggest enterprise in history. There is
nothing behind that enterprise save a few paper
statutes ; there isn’t even the cordial support of
our British suzerain. So any day it may happen
that Britain will job away our White Australia
ideal for the sake of buying the support of an
Asiatic power. Britain may not be strong enough
to do without a Japanese alliance, but it is quite
strong enough, as things stand, to wipe out the
White Australia ideal as the price of a Japanese
alliance ; and unless we build up a great manu-
facturing and agricultural population, and put
our finances in order, and arm our people, and
build our own navy, and get our own gun, our
alliance may not seem to commercial England of
such value as to make it worth while aggravating
an important nigger on our account. England,
these days, is horribly and pathetically commer-
cial. It speaks gently—very gently, in fact it
hardly speaks at all—to the men who flog China-
men almost to death in South Africa, but then they
represent the money power of Europe. It speaks
severely to Australia over a petty Chinese factory
regulation; but then Australia doesn’t represent
anything in particular to commercial England just
now—not even its own gun.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA’S PROBLEM.
This is the sort of desert that most of S. Aus-
tralia is. The State’s total area, exclusive of the
Northern Territory, is 243,244,800 acres ; and, of
that, 141,014,152 acres, or much more than half, is
absolutely unoccupied ; it is under no form of
purchase, lease, or reserve whatever. About one-
third of the whole State is under pastoral lease ;
and how much even that third is worth can be
sized up from the fact that the average rental is a
penny a year for a little more than 13 acres. In
other words, one can rent a square mile of it for
four years for less than £l. This includes the
best with the worst; so it looks as though one can
rent a mile of the worst of it for 20 years for as
many shillings. And still 141,014,152 acres, or
more than one-half of the whole State, isn’t
reckoned worth looking at on even those terms.
Moreover, S. Australia has spent over a million
(£1,066,500, to be exact) either in making improve-
ments on alleged pastoral country hi the hope of
getting somebody to drive his jumbucks upon it,
and to occasionally send along a twopenny stamp
by way of rent, or in buying up the jmprovements
of people who have gone “on tlie land” and
then been starved off it. It'couldn’t get
people to make dams and tanks unless it under-
took to buy the alleged improvements in case the
owners were starved off; and now, besides having
sunk a few hundred thousands of Cohen’s money
in dams that are mostly silted up by dust, or fences
that are only useful to divide the east from the
west, a considerable annual sum goes out to sup-
port caretakers, who see that the fence does its
work properly. Anybody could have the use of
these “improvements” as well as the land, if he
wanted them and looked like making use of them;
but even that inducement isn’t enough. Only one
acre in every 33 in the State has been sold out-
right, though another one in every 4S is held with
the right of purchase ; therefore the freeholds are
comparatively small patches of 'coastal lands.
There isn’t even a fringe of freehold. And yet so
bare of good public lands is the State that the
average price received by the Treasury during
the past few years has tumbled in this way :—■
Acres. Average Price.
1901 .. .. 11,920 £lB 3
1902 .. .. 19,832 105
1903 .. .. 27,716 0 15 4
1904 .. .. 27,452 0 16 0
1905 .. .. 53,817 0 12 6
There has been a bit of extra demand for land, or
there has been a bit of -extra demand for “re-
venue,” and to supply even 53,817 acres S.
Australia has had to throw in desert which brings
down the average paid for the freehold to 12s. 6d.
per acre.
* * * *
Nevertheless, where land is fertile in S. Aus-
tralia, some of it is amazingly fertile. The little
scrap of volcanic soil in the south-east is equal to
almost anything in Australia. On the Adelaide
plains, again, and on parts of the hill-slopes, there
are scraps of land of great productiveness. But
practically the whole of these were grabbed in the
first days of the State ; and some of them are used
as sheep-walks still. BucKland Park, owned, like
many of the best areas, by an absentee, is within
20 miles of Adelaide. The chances are that it
would have gone on being a sheep-run, just as it
has been for the past 60 years, if Premier Price
hadn’t come along with his more stiffly graduated
land-tax. Every State in the Commonwealth
needs such a tax, but probably no other State needs
it so badly as S. Australia—certainly none has
greater need of it. The fact that the State can only
now supply twelve-and-sixpenny land goes a long
way to prove that; and there is also proof of the
same thing in the fact that in the past 10 years
the State has spent £470,000 in the repurchase of
land, and yet hasn’t been able to check the out-
ward flow of population. It can’t develop the
“great natural resources” by running out cock-
spur railway lines ; it knows that it hasn’t any
remote agricultural resources to develop. The
fact that even the squatter won’t look at most of
the country, and that what he does look at he gets
for less than ss. per square mile per annum, proves
that. S. Australia’s one hope, therefore, is to
make the very best use of ’such fertile scraps as it
has; and it has been proved that, left to thern-
selvs, the early grabbers won’t make the best use
of it. Therefore a stiff graduated land-tax becomes
absolutely indispensable to force them to do
what they have proved that they won’t do other-
wise. Even then there seems to be no great future
before the State in the matter of “the great
natural producing industries.” It is too poor a
country, anyhow, to stick to those industries, and
let others do for it all the other services it needs.
If it had vast areas of immensely rich soil it might
be a fool to trouble about making its own boots or
clothes or machinery ; but it clearly isn’t that sort
of country. To make any progress it must
hang on to every bit of work it has to do ; in
other words, it can’t afford to believe in anything
but High Protection,
.* * * *
There is a good deal of “local patriotism ” in
S. Australia ; but, unfortunately, it is the sort of
“patriotism” that shows itself in a sweep of the arm
and a vague remark concerning “ our vast inherit-
ance in the Hills,” and another sweep of the
arm and a further vague remark concerning
“ the vast mineral resources of the interior.” Yet
“ the Hills ” are yielding less now than they did
30 years ago, and “the mineral resources of the
interior ” are mostly represented by a long pro-
cession of wild-cats and small tucker-fields. S.
Australia had better get down, then, to hard facts,
For the past 20 years it has this ghastly record :
In every year but two—lB92 and 1893—it lost
people by excess of emigration over immigration ;
and the gain in even those two years was due to
the mineral developments in another State. It
has been living on expectations concerning “our
inheritance in the Hills,” and waiting for some-
thing to turn up; and nothing has turned up.
But there are some things that it knows it has ;
and it is up to it now to turn-to and make the
best use of them—by cordially accepting Price’s
graduated land-tax, with regrets that it doesn’t
go further; and by ruling out every Foreign-trader,
and thus stopping the insane policy of compelling
the Australian to become a foreigner in order to
supply Australia with the things it needs. A loss
of population in 18 years out of 20 surely ought to
be enough to make any country think hard and
act sharply.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Postage Stamp of Secesh.
The N.S.W. Secession party in the State Assem-
bly, last week unfurled a tuppenny stamp as its
banner, and cried out loudly for “some action,”
because the Commonwealth had, it was said,
decided to establish its stamp-printing business at
the Adelaide printing office, which it owns.
There are two reasons for this : The Adelaide
printing office is the only one which the Australian
Government has got; and the records show that
the Adelaide office has always produced its stamps
at a lower price than any other office. But though
the Secession party, which is mostly the old
Foreign-trade party, is always willing to approve
of the “economy” effected by making engines,
boots, cloths, &c., for Australia in England, or
Germany, or Japan, it bitterly resents secuiing
economy by centralising at Adelaide the Coramon-
inonwealth’s tiny little stamp-printing business.
It is filled with fury at the idea of taking away
from Sydney an industry which employs four men
in order to establish it in another Australian city;
and over this trifle it raged, as it rages when it is
proposed to fulfil the implied purposes of Federa-
tion and do away with the State Governors,
second Chambers, Agents-Gener&l, and other
extravagant superfluities. These extracts from
Hansard report of the debate should be read
carefully, with frequent mental note Or the fact
that the matter at issue was that of milk nig an
obviously desirable economy by centralising the
stamp-printing businesses of the Commonwealth :
Mr. VV. Anderson (Balmain): The unconstitutional
aspect of it, in my judgment, shows itself in the fact that
before the Federal capital site has been settled by the
Federal Parliament, we have the introduction of a new
printing establishment in one of the lesser States, thus
centralising another very large part of the busi-
ness of the State in that centre... It is felt
that instead of the Commonwealth being a benefit
to Australia, it is quite the reverse.
Mr. Carrutiiers (Premier) : We are getting to that stage
when we shall have to cease discussing these injustices
which are being perpetrated on N.S.W. The time is arri\-
ing when N.S.W. will have to let those who run the Federal
Government know that we have rights, and that w e
intend to assert those rights, and not to submit to a long
series of continuous and persistent injustices which were
never contemplated when we entered into the Federal
compact.
Mr. Jesser : Why not strike now?
Mr. Carrutiiers : The time will soon arrive for this
State to take some de.inite action, and I feel assured that
if that definite action is taken in a reasonable, calm, and
determined spirit, there will be an end.of this treatment,
of which this State has every reason to complain.
Mr. Law (Balmain): The Federal Parbament seems to
try to get at New South Wales every time. . . I admire
the stand the Prime Minister is tak ng. He is fighting
strenuously in the interests of New South Wales, and is
acting in conformity with the desires of the majority of
the people of this State.
Mr. Wood (Bega): If we are to be continually met by
this inconsiderate and more or less non-intelligent atti-
tude of Federal administrators in dealing w th New South
Wales matters, it will certainly become this House, and,
I presume, the people of New South Wales, to take up a
different attitude.
Mr. Norton (Surry Hills): This important discussion,
than which I know of no more important for many a long
day. . . I fully coincide with the declaration of the Prime
Minister that the time has come when this, the mother
State, the most powerful and most influential, and the
State which is the real financial, moral and political basis
of the Federation, must receive common consideration
and fair play. I regard this outrageous proposal to,
without rhyme or reason, or any evidence in favor of
economy to support it, shift a department of the Federal
Government practically from this State into Adelaide, as
the outcome of our own indifference towards similar acts
of injustice. ... I submit that a free people, who, of its
own will at the ballot-box, can debveritself into the hands
of a central form of government like Fede.ation that will
perpetrate against them such acts of injustice as the.se,
should be equally free to take the opp jrtunity of revising
the form of Government to which they consented, and I
say that the Premier will not be doing his duty, unless in
the meantime the Federal Government assumes a different
attitude towards this State, unless the form in wh.cli lie
brings Federal matters before this House on that special
occasion to which he referred the other night and this
evening, takes the shape of a referendum, and a direct
appeal to the people to ascertain their will and wishes in
this important matter.
Mr. Jbssep (Waverley): I would not be surprised if they
proposed to take everything from us, and the sooner we
show the red flag the better.
Mr. Hollis (Newtown): The hon. gentleman having
induced this State to go into the Federal imbroglio, 1 am
prepared to follow' him if he will try to get us out of it.
False guide though the Prime Min ster proved himself to
be on the Federation question, still, if he will come down
with a definite motion to get us out of the trouble; he
will have no more faithful supporter than myself.
Mr. Cohen (Petersham): Members of the House ought
with one voice to proclaim their indignation at the action
of the Federal Government.
Mr. Charlton (Northumberland): I quite agree with the
protest that is proposed to be made, and I think the time
has arrived when we, as representatives of New South
Wales, should show' to the public what has taken place.
Mr. Moxham (Parramatta) : We can only constitutionally
enter our protest; we must not forget that these protests
—protest after protest—are only leading up to the great
question whether we are to remain a part of this Federa-
tion. I recognise at once that it is not possible for New
South Wales alone to withdraw from it; but all these
methods that are being adopted to-day by the Federal
Government are leading up to the great question whether
we shall not have to appeal to the people to break away
from the union.
And all these speakers were grown men! Not
children deprived of their lolly-sticks for the good
of their little stomachs ! On the other side there
was only one voice lifted, that of a man with
whom Tiik Bulletin is seldom in agreement of
late, E. W. O’Sullivan, who had in this niatter
the sense to satirise the childish complainings of
the “secession ” crowd. Deplorable as it is to
see adult men behaving with such silliness, there
is yet some satisfaction to be got from this stamp


incident. It should serve to show to the Aus-
tralian Parliament that, whilst the Australian
people have federated, the Australian politicians
have not. A certain proportion of Bumbles will
always get to the State Parliaments by promising
bridges, subscribing to cricket clubs, and helping
along land-agency transactions; and these men
will never be anything but anti-I ederal, never
anything but hostile to the power which saps their
petty dignity. And the buzzing of these Bum-
bles, outraged in their dearest feelings as they
seethe inevitable dwindling of their importance,
will always be loud. It will rage and shriek
“ unconstitutional ” on any pretext or on no pre-
text at all. It is as ready to chew soap and froth
at the mouth over a twopenny stamp as over a
Federal capital. That being so, it is absurd to
give any consideration to its foam. Since it will
talk secession for any reason, or without any
reason, it should be left to mumble and chatter in
its corner. In the past the mistake has been made
of listening seriously to the murmurs of the State
Frights crowd. The stamp debate should make
that mistake impossible for the future. As usual,
by the way, N.S.W. Assembly is the one great
blubbering infant of the Commonwealth. Other
States also lose their stamp-printing jobs through
the transfer of the whole business to one office,
but they don’t regard the matter as anything out
of the ordinary run of events. It is fortunate that
there is only one such State Parliament as that of
N.S.-W. in the Commonwealth. If the weeping
infant were twins ! ! !
A Quack Prevention Law.
The Bent Government has circulated a Bill which
proposes to make it very warm indeed for the
quack doctors who loaf on the Victorian com-
munity. The Victorian medical law, as it now
stands, forbids anyone not on the official
register to call himself a doctor, and also pro-
hibits such persons charging fees, or at any
rate recovering them at law. But both these
provisions have been evaded by the quacks.
They call themselves “professors,” “.herbalists,”
“American healers,” “medical electricians,” and
so forth ; and, instead of asking for a consul-
tation fee, they charge outrageous prices for their
mixtures, and announce that they give “advice
gratis.” The new Act contains a clause pro-
hibiting anyone but a doctor or a chemist
dispensing medicine, or rendering medical or
surgical aid for a fee; and any trans-
gression carries a fine of up to £5O,
so unless the “ Timbuctoo healer” gives his
advice and medicine free, and “gets there”
by charging 18s. fid. for a pot plant, his day
will be over. Victoria, just now, is a shark-
haunted community. There are “ Chinese
doctors,” “Hindu eye-doctors,” “herbalists” of
various nationalities, “Indian healers,” Egyptian
dodgers, and others. If the Bill flattens out only
half these impostors it will do a lot of good. It
might be worth the while of the Assembly to
consider the advisability of applying the White
Australia principle to the measure, by means of a
ciausi.f.. Aking it a penal offence, or something
near it", y >.j’ v Asiatic to do anything at all in a
medical wayv 'This would do away, at one fell
sweep, with the whole tribe of Fatty Shams and
Stink Hings that at present get an easy living
as Indian doctors and Chinese herbalists, and so
on. Also, it might be well, in view of the
possible pot-plant dodge herein hinted at,
to add a clausa providing that, when a
person professes to pursue the healing art, any-
thing he may sell to a person whom he has sup-
plied with medical advice—even a geranium or a
bookcase—shall be regarded as medicine, and
must not be charged for. Victoria might come in
for some British scorn, as the only country on
earth which regarded a wheelbarrow or an old
book as medicine, but that need not deter it from
taking reasonable precautions.
Backing Down to the Jap.
Prime Minister Deakin’s proposed amendments
of the Immigration Act read in places like the
compromise of a man who has made compromise
a fine art and the search for the line of least
resistance a science. In some respects they are
unobjectionable; in others, they look like the
beginning of a dangerous course of apology. One
of the first results will be that domestic servants
and personal attendants who are accompanying
their employers will be exempt from the anti-
contract labor laws —a proviso which can’t do any
visible harm, and which will prevent Horace
Tozer making a fool of himself again about his
wife’s maid. Other contract labor is allowed to
be imported if the contract seems to the Minister
to be a fair one according to Australian wage
rates and the Australian cost of living, if the labor
isn’t imported with a view to affecting an
industrial dispute, and if there is a difficulty
in obtaining within the Commonwealth a suffi-
ciency of equally skilled workers. Though
George Reid objects from force of habit there is
nothing objectionable about any of these items.
But Deakin’s proposal to vary the existing law as
regards colored aliens is a different affair. He
proposes to provide that the Education Test for
immigrants, instead of being in some European
language, may be in any prescribed language—
Chinese, Japanese, or any other Asiatic variety—
and this makes the present large and objection-
able hole still larger. Under the present law the
application of the test to Asiatics is, unfortu-
nately, not compulsory, and if ever the very worst
kind of Ministry happens in Australia, that
Ministry may let in Asiatics wholesale by declin-
ing to apply the test at all. Under the new law
it may admit Asiatics wholesale while professing
a busy and anxious desire to enforce the law—by
the simple process of testing them in their own
language. Therefore, there are to be two orifices
instead of one. Japan has already demanded
that its language shall be one of those which may
be used in a test. It will probably next demand
that as regards its own brown subjects its own
language shall be used as a test every time, and if
it carries that point also, the barrier against
Jap immigration will be about as completely gone
as if it had never existed. Then Deakin’s foolish
Bill provides that arrangements may be made to
exempt the people of any country from any and
every kind of test, and the first voice heard at
this country’s keyhole demanding to be exempt
will almost certainly lie that of Japan. And it
must be remembered that, though a contract labor
clause is very good for keeping out desirable white
workers and some of the more remote colored
races, it is very little good in the way of keeping
out the Jap and the Chinaman, therefore it
isn’t safe to relax the clauses which do serve
to keep them out. The skilled white artisan,
who is worth high wages, often wants
an agreement as a guarantee that work in his
line will be provided at adequate rates; the
yellow man, who is willing to undersell everybody,
and to economise by living eight in a room, needs
no agreement. That kind of man can always get
a job at somebody’s expense. The barrier was too
weak before, and Deakin, in his lamentable desire
to be affable, makes it weaker. It had holes in it
before ; the new device makes it liable to become
all hole. Instead of trying to placate the Jap,
who won’t be placated by anything short of the
free run of the country, Australia should hasten to
arm itself and to fill the country up with strong
white men so as to leave no room for the Jap. Of
course it can’t do that until it supplies work for
men (and the tariff is in the way), also till it
finds land for them (and the big landgrabber is
in the way). But if Alfred Deakin were a real
whole man, he would put his head down and
butt straight at those two obstacles as the
most honest w'ay out of the Jap trouble.
He could only lose his billet at the worst, and
better lose it honorably than keep it dishonorably,
But he couldn’t lose unless the Labor party failed
to support him, and it is his duty to dump his
High Tariff Bill, his Federal Graduated Land-
Tax Bill and his White Immigration Bill on the
table of the House, and tell the Labor party that
if it doesn’t help him with all its strength to
carry them, the blood of Australia will be on its
head, and that, like Pilate, he will wash his
hands of all responsibility. Britain is un-
doubtedly dissatisfied with the present position
of affairs, but there are two ways to make things
square with Britain. One is to back down to its
bumptious little brown friend. The other is to
build up such a nation in Australia and such an
army and navy that, when they are thrown into
the scale in any just quarrel, Britain can do with-
out its brown friend ; and, having done that, to
ask Britain which friend it will have.
The Lobbying Importer Again.
The precious importer, the agent of foreign traders
to whom Australia is merely a dumping ground,
has been defendant in an interesting matter known
as the “ Balata ” belting case. The matter, which
had the attention of the Customs authorities
since ’O3, amounted to a charge that a brassy
attempt was made to “ rook ” the Customs by the
Melbourne importers on the false pretence that
their principals—a Scottish firm —had allowed them
an extra discount, and this alleged extra dis-
count, being deducted from the invoice, naturally
reduced the duty. At first the Commonwealth
Parliament put this belting on the free list, but
on March 6th, 1902, it was made dutiable at 20
per cent. In August, 1902, the duty was lowered
to 15 per cent, as a result of the difference of
opinion between the Senate and Representatives.
The prosecution put in some really choice
letters from the Australian importers to
their Scottish principals showing the why
and wherefore of this “difference of opinion.”
On April 2nd these lovely lobbyists wrote : “We
are again this week personally working the Senators
in regard to this belting duty ... we approach
you for a further concession in the way of dis-
count...” On April 23rd a third epistle
informed the canny Scots that “we
are doing our best to induce the Senators
to put on a merely revenue duty instead of 20 per
cent.” On July 25th, further correspondence
notified that “ ... we have been working very hard
interviewing both members of the Representatives
and Senators, and in the latter, where there is a
slight majority of Freetraders, we were able to
get them to advise a reduction of the duty to 10
per cent.” All this hard toil, though it injured
Australian industry by getting the duty lowered
from 20 to 15 per cent., apparently failed to soften
the hearts of the canny Scots, and they declined
to allow any further discount, so these “com-
mercial men” are said to have got what they
could out of the Customs by representing the dis-
count as 40, instead of the actual 20 per cent. This
was the case as put by the Customs authorities.
But the part of the tale that is most interesting to
Australians is that about the Senators who were
“ interviewed ” and “ worked ” to induce them to
damage an Australian industry for the benefit of
those remarkable importers. How do you “work”
a Senator when you want him to wreck an Aus-
tralian industry for the benefit of a rich importer ?
Will someone get a Royal Commission appointed
to find out ?
A Sample of British Snuffle.
The British Government, in raising objections to
the anti-Asiatic clauses of the Westralian Fac-
tories Act, appears as a shocking hypocrite as well
as a muddle-headed meddler. Those clauses limit
the number of hours during which an Asiatic
may work in factories; and especially prohibit
Asiatics from carrying on business as owners of
factories, or from being employed in factories,
unless in business or so employed prior to Novem-
ber, 1903. The Act is remarkable in the sense that
it cuts direct at the root of an acknowledged evil
in plain terms and with effectual provisions. The
British objection is apparently based on the appli-
cation of special restrictions to Asiatic races
which do not apply to European races. It
is instructive, therefore, to turn for precedents to
the Transvaal Labor Ordinance (1904) that master-
piece of Conservative legislation under which the
Witwatersrand is being flooded with Chinese
slaves for the benefit of Bull-Ooiien, and of which
the present British Government is particularly
proud. In that Act “ laborer ”is defined as
a male person Belonging to a non-European race other
than one of the races indigenous to Africa south of 12
degrees north of the Equator, introduced to this colony
under contract of service.
A far more sweeping racial differentiation than
any in the W.A. Act, as it bundles together in
one careless lot Japs, Chinese, British Indians,
Pacific Island cannibals and most African savages
as “non-European races”! For special restric-
tions, that do not apply to the European, the
Transvaal Act provides that—
It shall not be lawful for any laborer (as defined above)
to enter, be, or reside, or to be introduced into this
colony unless he shall previously have entered into the
contract referred to in section eight.
Unless, in fact, he has first become a chattel,
known by a registered number, liable to be
passed from hand to hand by transfer in writing
at the pleasure of his owner, forbidden to leave
his stockade without a pass, forbidden to hold,
purchase, lease, or own property, to do skilled
labor, or to carry on any trade or business. While
such drastic provisions are enforced in the Trans-
vaal against all “laborers” of non-European
origin (Japanese, Indians, Chinese, etc.) with
the high approval of the British Govern-
ment, it seems a most malevolent variety of
hypocrisy and mere premeditated snuffle and
insult to take objection to the very moderate
restrictions to Asiatic employment provided by
the Westralian Act. To put British Chadband-
ism to a test, how would it be for Aus-
tralia to copy Britain’s own law as applied to
the Transvaal, and pass an Act forbidding the
entry into Australia of all Asiatic races except
under contract with some company authorised by
Act of Parliament to import (and flog) Asiatics ?
Then, by refusing to grant any company the right
of-contract (and flogging), Britain’s own law as
applied to the Transvaal would be a complete
prohibition of the Asiatic influx—a far better one
than Australia has ever yet had. The spectacle
of Britain violently putting a veto on its own law
as insulting to its Jap ally would be interesting.
Only a Million a Year.
Australia gets a wonderful amount of advice
from benevolent persons, who mean well, but who,
apparently, don’t know. A recent sample is Mr.
T. A. Dibbs, manager of the Commercial Banking
Co. of S dney, who has just come back from Eng-
land, and finds that N.S. W. isn’t popular there-
in fact it is so unpopular that it would be difficult
to raise a loan in London just now on anything
like “fair terms.” And Mr. Dibbs’ remedy for
this sad condition of things is that N.S.W. should,
for the time at least, “limit its borrowings to
£1,000,000 a year, and find the rest of the money
out of revenue.” He reckons that if this were
done N.S.W. would, in a few years, “reinstate
itself in the financial world.” Some people might
rather imagine that in a few years it would go to
perdition, and would deserve its destination. Mr.
Dibbs’ proposal is that N.S.W. should, in a time
of peace, and with no defence expenditure worth
mentioning, borrow a sum which would amount to
the same thing in proportion to population, as if the
United Kingdom borrowed about £30,000,000 a
year regularly. He proposes that N.S.W. should
add to its debt every' two years as much per
inhabitant as the whole debt of Switzer-
land. The State has, in proportion to its popula-
tion, a magnificent land revenue such as no other
country on earth ever enjoyed, half of it being
acquired by the sale of the public assets ; but as
the sale of assets can’t go on for ever, N.S.W. will
have to learn some day to do without a lot of this
revenue. Mr. Dibbs doesn’t propose that it
should learn to do so now, before the interest bill
grows larger, by the simple process of putting the
land revenue into a public works account and
swearing off the loan-and-cadge habit. His
idea seems to be that the State should
go on adding £35,000 each year to its in-
terest bill, so that when the land-sale re-
venue at last dies out there will be perhaps
£700,000 a year more interest to pay, and
about £1,000,000 a year less revenue to pay it with,
while the borrowing habit will have become even
more confirmed. There is no mention in Mr.
Dibbs’ philosophy of any possible future day when
borrowing will cease, nor of any period when re-
payment will start. In fact, N.S.W., having got
into trouble by borrowing, the great and brilliant
idea of Bank Manager Dibbs is that it should go
on borrowing till it gets out of trouble. In a
general way Manager Dibbs appears to regard
borrowing as our natural condition—like eating,
or being born, or receiving Christian burial.
There is no country on earth in a better position,
not only to leave off borrowing, but also to com-
mence a systematic reduction of its public debt,
than N.S.W., for its land revenue gives it a chance
such as no other country ever possessed and such
as N.S.W. itself is never likely to possess again.
But the community is bogged by the well-meant
advice of so many elderly gentlemen, who think
that we are unlike any other people on earth—
that we are the Chosen Borrowers, and that we
were never meant to endeavor, like other races, to
be perpendicular and self-reliant, and owe no Jew
anything.
Things that Need Explanation.
A little group of Australian and ex-Australian
financial men has been putting some tens of
thousands of Australian money into Japanese
concerns. After a successful coup in tramways,
these people formed the British and Japanese
Finance Corporation, in 120,000 £5 shares and
20,000 £1 deferred shares. Malcolm McEacharn
put in £30,000 ; his partner, Mcllwraith, £20,000 ;
Mcllwraith, McEacharn & Co., £10,000; and
James Burns, of Burns, Philp & Co., £12,000.
And the S. M. Herald, noting that Australians
are largely interested in this new general trading
and development concern, remarks—
How it is that Japan should he regarded as a desirable
country for the investment of Australian capital, while
Australia still remains only partially developed, requires
a good deal of explanation.
The Herald leaves it at that ; it doesn’t
give or attempt to give the great deal of
explanation that it says the case calls for.
It doesn’t point out that, in conformity with the
Herald s own foolish policy, Australia is a low-
tariff country, and that a man would, generally
speaking, be a fool to put his money into Aus-
tralian industrial business, seeing that the busi-
ness would be almost sure to be kiiocke i out bv
the products of cheaper labor countries. It doesn’t
point out that a man would be a fool to put his
money into factories in Australia and pay high
wages, when he can supply the same market by
putting up factories in Japan and getting the
work done at low wages. It doesn’t point out to
the Labor party the utter absurdity, in the
light of these things, of thinking that high
wages and low tariff can run together.
It doesn’t point out that Japan, even
though it is a cheap - labor country, protects
itself against any possible cheaper labor country
by a Customs tariff running up to 150 per cent.
ad valorem. It doesn’t point out that, as the
result of dropping the S.M. Herald’s own policy
overboard with great emphasis, Japan has in-
creased its cotton manufactures 40-fold in 15
years, and other industries almost as much.
Likewise che S.M. Herald doesn’t explain that
Japan imposes one of the heaviest land-taxes in
the world, and derives close upon £7,000,000 of
revenue from this source alone ; that it has prac-
tically wiped out the big landlord ; and that over
three-fifths of the whole of the arable land in the
country is cultivated by peasant proprietors.
Also, it doesn’t point out that Japan hasn’t
been afraid of the bogey-cry of Socialism.
That country wanted iron and steel works,
just as Australia does, and knew that
it couldn’t be great without them ; and
though it had no good available iron ore to speak
of, and had to import most of the raw material
from China, and though its coal is not nearly as
good as that of N.S.W., it established iron and
steel works. Further, it set to work to pay its
way. It never got into the deficit habit. It
didn’t assume that the only way to do anything
was to borrow money to do it with. It wanted to
own things itself instead of paying a foreigner for
owning them ; and to do that it made a State
monopoly of the tobacco business, among other
things. It wasn’t perpetually talking about any
Mother Country ; it didn’t feel called upon to be
foolish because any other country was making an
ass of itself, and allowing its trade to slip
out of its hands. It thought about itself
for itself; that was its patriotism. It
therefore never worshipped foreign capital
it knew that foreign capital was foreign
debt, and it wanted to work for itself and not for
any foreigner. And so it grew, and became, in a
measure, prosperous—marvellously prosperous,
anyhow, compared with what it had been, and,
considering the materials, human and otherwise,
that it had to work with. And it accomplished
all this by doing almost everything that the S.M.
Herald says a country shouldn’t do—by high
Protection, by a stiff land-tax, by abolishing the
great landlord, by State Socialism, by paying for
public works out of taxation (land-tax, income-
tax, business-tax, Customs duties, &c.), and by
treating the man who talks reverently about “ the
influx of foreign capital ” with the disrespect he
deserves. Now, as usual, the outsider is seizing a
chance to jump in and share in the advantages
that these things have brought the country (though
in a year or two Japan will probably take him by
the neck and throw him out again, as it usually
does); and the Herald says that the circumstance
“ requires a good deal of explanation.”

The Stinking Fish Campaign.
The old Conservative party in Australia —the one
which lost its hold so badly a few years ago—has
now spent two or three years in a struggle to
recover its old position by outside influences, and
has met with very little success. In Australia
the party was too well known for its utterances to
carry any weight, except within its own narrow
circle. The community knows its members, and
doesn’t know them favorably. It has seen their
signatures on lying balance-sheets and swindling
prospectuses away back in the boom time. _ It
remembers their heartless robberies of the savings
of the poor. It knows their great estates —also
the dummying, forgery and fraud by which some
of these estates were got together. It has just
been inspecting their agency doings, and has
seen the amazing wealth of lies that they would
descend to for a very small consideration. It
has just heard it explained with engaging
frankness how land-owners and commercial
men profess to have combined together to
bribe a Department to dissipate the public
estate for their benefit. Australia is acquainted
with its landed Tories, and its rich com-
mercial Tories, and the handful of fashionable
parsons who fetch and carry for them in return
for contributions to the tabernacle, which is orna-
mented neither by the presence of the preacher
who is sold nor by that of the people who bought
him. Being thus so badly discredited in his own
country, the Australian Tory of the worst type set
up a propaganda outside. He sought, by a tre-
mendous process of organised lying throughout
the world, to excite, in every English-speaking
country, a cry of horror at the imaginary doings
of the democratic party in Australia,, and he suc-
ceeded pretty well. Wherever an Australian Tory
of the bad old type went, the world was informed of
bogus horrors from this side—the total prohibition
of immigrants, the throwing overboard and drown-
ing of colored sailors shipwrecked on the coast,
the imprisonment of British tradesmen for coming
here to earn an honest living, the vanishing of
population, the disappearance of capital, the
general closing up of everything. Things which
Maoriland, Canada, the United States, and Eng-
land do, and have done for years, without any-
body regarding them as in the least degree
unusual, excite consternation when Australia even
proposes to do them in a modified form ; and
these things, combined with the things which
Australia never did, or even proposed to do, have
made this country, for the time, a bye-word.
It was expected that the democratic party would
be staggered by the storm of obloquy
thu3 created—that in the face of the wide
execration which was supposed to have been
roused by its policy, but which was really
roused by the lies told about its policy, so
many people would fall away from the party that
it would lose its influence, and the old Tory gang
of land-dummies and bank-robbers and commercial
thieves would come back to power on a wave of
popular feeling. It didn’t matter to these Tories
if they made Australia, by their lies and slanders,
a thing of loathing all the world over, provided the
outside pressure thus created brought about a re-
vulsion that would restore them to political office,
and enable them to fill the country with nigger
labor, and steal more land, and avert the
threatened breaking up of their great estates to
make room for settlement. It is pleasing to know
that in this respect they have failed. They have
taught the people to loathe the very names of the
traitors who are willing to blacken the good name of
their own country for the sake of getting back to the
jobs and the salaries and the perquisites of office,
and making more secure the profits of old-time
steals. They have made many good Australians hate
the ve-y name of England by reason of the slanders
which the English press, partly at the instigation
of Austv: lian Tories, has heaped on this country.
They have made many more Australians hate the
church and its mmistei s because so many
of them have lent themsehes to the anti-
The Fleet.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Boomerang and Karrakatta, late cruisers on the
Australian station, have been sold in England for about
£lBOO each. —Statement in the Australian Parliament.
Let the council stop the traffic ;
Make the concertina wail;
For we want to do a Maffick
On a transcendental scale ;
That our grat'tude may show in
Such a fashion as is meet
To our good old Uncle Cohen
With his pretty cardboard fleet.
For he sends it o’er the water
With a tearful tenderness,
And he only asks a quarter
Of a million, more or less.
While our gain, if we behave, is,
As his praise we loudly bleat,
That he’ll let us play at navies
With his pretty cardboard fleet.
Though the armor plates be dented
Where the cook has thrown the crust,
We should always be contented
If the boilers haven’t bust.
Though no gun is safe to blow in
And the engine’s obsolete,
We must grateful be to Cohen
For his little cardboard fleet.
They have plenty flags and pennants,
Polished brass work, bright as gold ;
They have handsome young lieutenants
Mashing gii'ls with glances bold ;
AH the boats were reckoned charming,
As a rabbit clean and neat,
And quite equally alarming
Is Australia’s cardboard fleet.
So let money freely flow in
As it flowed in heretofore,
To the safe of Uncle Cohen,
Who protects Australia’s shore.
And the only boon we crave is,
When the yearly bill we meet,
That he’ll let us play at navies
With his little cardboard fleet.

Australian conspiracy. But with it all the Tory
slanderers. are really no nearer to power. The
dream of a return to the ways of the period before
the boom burst and before the present democratic
party appeared in Parliament—when among the
front-rank men of politics could be counted
lialf-a-score whose bankruptcies, bogus com-
pany swindles, and miscellaneous commer-
cial frauds smelled like an open drain—remains
only a dream. Many of the political leaders of
the Stinking Fish movement are men who have
become impossible in the cleaner politics of to-day,
when, though occasional public frauds do come to
light, they are mostly the work of a few Tories
who have been left over from the wreck. They
don’t know that they have become impossible,
but that is merely through their inability to
realise what they were and what kind of a smellful
era they belonged to.

The S.M. Herald’s Implied Falsehood.
The Sydney Morning Herald, for a little while
of late, threatened to become a decent, fair-minded
and reasonably truthful paper, and showed some
unexpected gleams of patriotic Australian spirit.
Apparently it has got over that, and become the
same narrow-minded, hypocritical, parochial rag
as of old. Witness this extract from its leader
(10/11/’O5) on “The Federal Capital ” :
This matter of the Federal capital is one upon which
New South Wales may well found its case against the
Commonwealth. Whatever may be said now, it is un-
deniably true that when the decisive vote teas cast in favor
of Federation it teas in the belief that the capital ivould
as soon as possible be established in New South Wales, and
that as nearly as possible to the hundred miles’ radius
from Sydney. Everybody knows that ; but now the rep-
resentatives of other States in the Federal Parliament
profess to believe that they can play fast and loose with the
clausein the Constitution Act. These representatives, aided
and abetted, we regret to say, by members returned by
New South Wales and by the iate SEE Ministry, claim that
they can select any site they choose. They have chosen
a site which, whilst very convenient to Victoria, is alto-
gether unacceptable to New South Wales. They have
chosen a site which is without railway communication,
which is distant hundreds of miles from Sydney, whose
soil is as unproductive as its position is inaccessible. It
is as if a private person consented to give to another a
camping-place on his land, and the recipient of this offer
assumed the right of establishing himself wherever he
pleased. New South Wales is bound to give the Common-
wealth a site for the Federal capital, but it is not bound
to accept the dictation of the Federal Parliament as to
the exact whereabouts of this site. In the circumstances,
the people of New South Wales will agree with Mr.
Carruthers when he asserts that faith has not been kept
with New South Wales in the matter, and they will back
him in every legitimate effort he may use to secure the
fulfilment of the compact.
According to the first italicised sentence, N.S.
Wales wouldn’t have joined the Common-
wealth unless the other States gave way and
agreed that the Parliament should camp on
its ground. (The statement is false, because
N.S. W. gave a majority for Federation when
there was nothing in the Constitution about the
capital being in N.S.W., but the State Parlia-
ment disgracefully broke its agreement with the
other States and annulled the acceptance. How-
ever, that is a side issue.) According to the
second italicised sentence N.S.W., as a favor,
consented to the Federal Parliament camping on
its ground, and because of this concession, made
by N.S.W., it has a right to say whereabouts the
Federal Parliament shall camp. Now, has the
Herald the assurance and the phenomenal lying
power to say that Australia in general asked
N.S.W. to be allowed to place the capital in
N.S.W. territory, and that the act was a conces-
sion made by N.S.W. to the other States? It
distinctly implies that when it speaks of “con-
senting to give to another a camping ground,” but
does it feel equal to telling the lie straight out ?
4,
A Proposed Tramway Steal.
Premier Bent is sending through Vic. Parliamen t
a Bill to enable the Railway Department to run
motor buses and cars along suburban routes,
as feeders to the railway traffic. The
Bill has met with the hot opposition of
shareholders in the Tramway Co.. and
the lobbying done by representatives of that
temporary monopoly (it is supposed to hand over
its business to a municipal trust in 1916, but it
intends to get a renewal if possible) was a magni-
ficent spectacle. The Vie. Legislative Council
consists largely of shareholders in the monopoly,
and their friends. Consequently, when the Bill
came before the House of Shareholders, this new
clause was inserted
No motor carriage or car shall ply for hire in any street
in which a line of tramway is laid, or use such street,
except for the purpose of crossing the same, or for a dis-
tance of 20 chains in order to leave or approach a railway
station.
The large shareholders declared that the clause
was needed to save the municipalities, when they
took control of the tramways, from ruinous State
competition. The Assembly cast the new clause
out with scorn. Then the House of Rich Land-
lords went one better, and altered the clause to
make it provide simply that
No motor carriage or car of the Victorian Railway Com-
missioners, hereby authorised, shall ply for hire in any
street in which a line of tramway is laid.
That is to say, the veil was dropped, and the
amendment was framed frankly in the interests of
the dividends of the present tramway co. and
future capitalist undertakings. This clause was
flung out by the Assembly without a word of
debate. The fact that the Tramway 00. is at pre-
sent a private monopoly is due greatly to the efforts
of the Fatmen’s Council of the past. Only the
tremendous efforts of that sick old lion, Fitz-
gibbon, induced the formation of the Trust and
the 1916 compromise. The first line of motor-
buses proposed by the Railway Department—
Prahran to Malvern—was bitterly opposed by an
M.L.C. who headed a syndicate with a rival
private scheme. There seems little chance
of the Council winning this time, but it
may. Bent has a habit of falling heavily from
a democratic position, when a certain section of
his old pals in commerce oppose him. The Vic.
Assembly should make certain that Bent is prop-
ped up this time, or allowed to fall for ever.
+
Besides sinking the fiscal question, N.S.W. Labor
party also appears to have sunk its platform.
That platform declares that the party is opposed
to any further borrowing except to carry out
undertakings which will pay interest and sinking
fund. To that every member of the party is
pledged ; it is his contract with his country and
his constituents. Yet the other night, when
Solemn Lee, Carruthers’ Works Minister, pro-
posed that the new Public Library should be
built with borrowed money, only three members
of the Labor party — Griffith, Meehan, and
Miller— thought it worth while to respect
their pledge or live up to their contract.
It isn’t suggested that a public library building
will ever pay interest, let alone sinking fund ; it
is well known, in fact, that it won’t earn anything
whatever, and every farthing of the interest on
the cost will have to be made up out of revenue.
But in spite of its pledge, in spite of its platform,
in spite of everything, the shiftless State Labor
party says “ Hear, hear ” to a shiftless Premier
and a shiftless Ministry ; and, instead of raising
the money to pay the bill, passes on the document
to posterity—another lump laid on to the load of
unproductive debt with which the community is
cursed. It might easily get the money and pay
the bill, and be done with it; it prefers, instead,
to open up an endless vista of interest-paying,
with the unpaid bill still always dangling in the
distance.

There is great excitement amongst Victorian
mayors and municipal councillors just at pre-
sent, in connection with the Union Label Bill,
now before the Australian Parliament. The re-
cently “consolidated” anti-Socialistic League
started the crusade ; but its howl was such a feeble
one that the Tory party fell back on its old device
and fled for support to the alderman. And the
alderman, true to his instincts, has responded to
the call. A circular, inviting the municipalities
to denounce the accursed label, has been distri-
buted broadcast throughout Victoria. In two or
three rare instances a council has simply “re-
ceived” the document, and has taken no action,
on the wise and sensible ground that municipal
bodies are elected to attend to the streets, the
bridges, the thistles, and the vagrant dog. But
in the vast majority of instances the councils
have arisen in their might, and have passed,
as a rule unanimously, a fierce condemna-
tion of the Bill, and many of them have
added a clause to the effect “that the local
Parliamentary representative be asked to vote
against the measure.” Of course the Australian
Parliament knows all about the unimportance of
the alderman’s opinion on any legislative question.
The alderman had his vote, along with others,
on election day, and if he had any manners or
taste he would accept the position. But the
alderman is for ever trying to ape the legislator,
and half the time of Vic. council meetings is
occupied with the consideration of matters that
are utterly foreign to them. If State Premier
Bent wants to further distinguish himself, he will
pass a law limiting the municipal subsidy to those
councils which, in the preceding twelve
months, have not discussed any political
question extraneous to their functions. The sub-
sidy would then be cut up amongst about six
shires, and the subsequent stunned silence of the
others would be something memorable.
Atlek Hunt, Commonwealth Secretary for
External Affairs, comes back from New Guinea
with a report that devotes itself anxiously to the
best means of making the black brother work for
the profit of the white. In happy New Guinea,
about two days a week spent in labor keep the
black boy in the means of subsistence, and he
shows a growing disinclination to work six or
seven days a week for the benefit of his employer.
Moreover, being entitled (under an ordinance of
1888) to refuse' to sell his land if he guarantees to
work it himself, he is disinclined to part with it at
the rate of a tomahawk and a glass bottle
per acre, but prefers to linger on it in
his own lazy style. Hunt proposes that
a Lands Acquisition Ordinance should be
passed, in order to shift the selfish savage
from his ancestral home, and that there-
after the land should be given to white settlers on
terms that “practically amount to giving it for
nothing.” Then Hunt says it is impossible for the
white man to work the land himself, and he there-
fore sets out to consider how “in the interests of
the native” the labor problem is to be faced. In
the interests of the native, his term of indenture
on a plantation, says Hunt, should be increased
from 12 months to three years, at the end of which
time the pernicious habit of laziness will have gone
from him. In the interests of the native, he should
be taught the necessity of labor by being taxed.
Then he’ll have to work, or go to gaol for not pay-
ing his taxes. The tax which Hunt prefers, in the
interests of the native, will take the shape of forced
labor on plantations. Altogether, the interests of
the native premise to be kept very steadily in view.
It isn’t easy to spe how anything can be done with
the black brother without being unpleasant to him,
yet it seems a pity that so much should be said
about the interests of the native. Couldn’t the
element of pious and moral sludge be left out of
public documents for once ?

One end of the Tariff Commission found its lower
jaw hanging down like an executed criminal
during the sittings in Perth. The boss of the
State’s biggest timber concern was giving evidence,
and said he had bought second-hand locomotives
from the contractors for the Coolgardie railway,
and they had been hauling ever since. The loads
were heavy and so were the grades and curves, but
these locomotives stood the wear and tear as well
as, if not better than, any English or American
engines. They were manufactured in S. Australia,
and some stationary engines turned out by the
Austral Otis Co. were equally satisfactory—quality
as good and price as low as anything imported.
Railway waggons, made of timber cut and dressed
by themselves, with locally-made ironwork, gave
better results than imported waggons ; in fact,
witness expressed his opinion that every truck
or waggon required for railway purposes should be
manufactured in the State. This from the general
manager of a big English concern fairly broke the
assembled Foreign Trade crowd into fragments.
Slowly Gropers are learning that jarrah has other
uses besides that of being sawn into railway
sleepers for foreign countries. Immense quantities
of splendid jarrah are destroyed because it will
not cut up for sleepers. A factory for working up
this waste into hubs, spokes, and felloes for drays
and waggons, flooring boards and even furniture,
ought to be a valuable business proposition.

“Merely Mary Ann,” at Her Majesty’s
(Sydney), is an interesting study from several
points of view. With its help, for instance, you
can see the different sorts of treatment which so
good a judge as Zangwill reckons necessary for a
book and for the theatre. The comparison isn’t to
the advantage of the theatre. Zangwill’s book
knocks off at the departure of Mary A. from Mrs.
Leadbatter’s premises—and that is right, for
Launcelot’s “mash” would, in 999 cases out of
1000, have ended just there. But the conven-
tion-ridden theatre wouldn’t stand that. It must
hear wedding-bells, and catch the panting of The
Voice as it reaches for its hat. So for the
theatre Zangwill had to weave the flagrantly
improbable into a fourth act, and keep the un-
certain flame of affection alive through a vast
stretch of years, during which the pair never see
one another, and each lives quite another sort of
life. The theatre hasn’t, in fact, got further
ahead than the Emma Jane Worboise novel, in
which they always lived happily ever afterwards ;
and yet it calls for situations in the opening acts
which makes the living-’appily-ever-afterwards
just about impossible. There are playwrights, of
course, who kick ; but—well, they don’t, as a rule,
go strong to the end of a fourth week, as “ Merely
Mary Ann ”is doing. And then think of what sort
of a blaze (at the back of a grate) a book would make
if it spent pages on such circus-clowning as Peter’s
pouring of the tea on to Mrs. Leadbatter’s carpet
instead of into the cups. The audience screams
at this nightly ; and Peter, as he does the clown-
ing, must wonder, if they like that sort of thing,
why they don’t buy circus tickets instead of
orchestra stalls. On the whole, they are rather
sad reflections that you see in the fireplace when
you go home from “Merely-Mary Ann” in a
philosophic humor.

suggest that there will be some Maori brown color
in the production.

Sometimes a theatre programme tells fibs
in its description of the piece presented. But
when the programme for “The Gondoliers”
describes the opera as Charming, Tuneful and
Witty, it tells the truth—not the whole truth, and
yet nothing but the truth. The Repertoire Com-
pany opened with the opera of the Venetian boat-
men on Saturday, at Sydney Criterion, and
carried the piece to its conclusion with the perfec-
tion that comes of practice and voices in capital
condition. The cast is, with one exception, the
same as that which left the city some months ago.
Messrs. Vernon, Kenningham and Wilson, Misses
Dolly Castles, Aggie Thorne, and Vinia D’Loitte
(as her name appears on the programme) are
at home in their gondolas and songs, and
H. H. Wallace, who was so lately an amateur,
looks and acts a hardened old prof, as the
famous Duke, Limited, and is delightfully hen-
pecked by Celia Ghiloni as his duchess. Next
Saturday will be produced “The Sorcerer” and
“ Trial by Jury.”

The weeping old “East Lynne” gives
Miss Lily Dampier her star show as Lady Isabel.
On Saturday she started a season at Sydney
Palace, and presented the Mrs. Henry Wood
heroine in all her tearfulness, to a sympathetic
house. Some audiences delight in a scene
between a mother and her dying child more
than in anything else on this earth, and Miss
Dampier gave Saturday’s gathering its heart’s
desire in the Little Willie variety of misery.
The Bulletin thinks that Lady Isabel does her
late husband too much honor when she dies at his
feet. He may be her “ wronged husband,” but
he has consoled himself. A newer version of “East
Lynne” ought to be written—a version in which
the second wife turns out to be the first one, shehav-
ing deceived her husband by borrowing Barbara’s
transformations and pin-curls, Barbara in the
meantime having gone off with the wicked Francis
Levison. Miss Dampier’s version is, however,
warmly received by the audience, and the piece
will weep bitterly till Friday, and a bucket will
stand in the orchestra to catch the tears. On
Saturday “ The Postmistress of the Czar ” is to be
produced for the first time in Australia.

The extra-special programme at Sydney
Tivoli is now packing that house eight times a
week, and the house, under the circumstances, de-
serves the treatment; for Leroy, Talma, and
Bosco’s feats of spookery and sleight-of-hand are
served up in a fashion that Australia hasn’t had
before. To them and the other good turns—in-
cluding Crimmins and Gore in some more fan-
tastic foolery—has now been added Arthur Albert,
a descriptive singer, who doesn’t depend so en-
tirely on the limelight for the descriptiveness as
some singers who have come along with the same
label upon their brassy countenances.

On Saturday night there were not enough
seats in Melbourne Princess’ to hold all the people
who wanted to see Nellie Stewart in the new
character of a fugitive thief seek-
ing sanctuary “In the Bishop’s
Carriage.” Readers of advance
notices of said “comedy-drama”
(alias common melodrama) had
been stimulated to an interest in
the novelty of the girl-and-
gaiters situation. Soon after the
curtain rose, however, the situa-
tion sank to commonplace, as
it became apparent that th<>
Bishop had pretty
girl in the <pjw;>Awloak (de-
signed by Wo. on expressly for
this production), in ignorance of
her crime. A golden-haired,
expensively-clad young thing,
understood to be a parson’s
daughter, suffering from the
effects of overstudy at college,
is not such a very tough camel to
swallow. Even a saint of high
degree may stoop to the assist-
ance of Innocence in distress
without detriment to the Cloth.
And this particular saint, being
a doddering old thing with
crotchets in his voice and qua-
vers in his legs, accepted the
brazen, slangy lady-burglar at
her own valuation. Hence, the
inferiority of this ecclesiastic
(who does good inadvertently and
entertains a sinner unawares) to
Hugo’s bishop in “Les Miser-
ables.”
* * *
When the Bishop (Harry
Hill) is hugged in his carriage by
hysterical Nance Olden (Nellie
Stewart), who, bounding in with
a stolen watch in her pocket,
feigns to mistake him for her
clerical papa, he carries her off
to the protection of his friend,
Mrs. Ramsay (Miss Singleton).
Mrs. Ramsay is a fat, comic
matron, bent on marrying her
daughter (Nannie Bennett) to
one Latimer. Latimer (Harcourt Beatty) is
a tired young billionaire, too bored to
love the Ramsay girl, yet too lazy to take himself
off ; so he dawdles round, twaddling galore to the
afflicted spinster on threadbare old texts, less or
more to the effect that burglars are better than
bakers, and thieves more precious than tailors.
He’s all ready to fall in love with the lady-burglar
when the Bishop brings her along. She has a
lover already, a fine upstanding burglar who has
trained her m her profession; but Latimer’s
broad-minded philanthropy falls short of he-
robbers, so Tom gets hunted and threatened
with the police. Nance herself is for a time uncer-
tain as to whether she will become a pure and
blameless actress under the Latimer auspices,
or just go on burgling in the firm of Dorgan and
Co., house-breakers. While undecided, she brings
her house-breaking beau to the rooms of her new
admirer, and, hiding the Stousher on the premises,
departs in a whirl of regret, remorse, and general
hysteria. In the end, Latimer routs Dorgan with
a revolver and sends him to gaol, but it is no thanks
to the ladies that there isn’t a dead philanthropist
on hand in the morning! One writes “ladies”
advisedly, for the Ramsay spinster, Latimer’s high-
class admirer, smarting under the conscious-
ness of having been cut out, is a party to the
burglar scheme.
* * * #
Relieved of her cracksman chum, “Nance”
develops into a theatrical star respectfully
adored by her philanthropist, and persecuted by
the attentions of Ramsay senior (Dudley Clinton).
The latter is an inebriate ancient, built on lines
popular with American playwrights, who are fond
of depicting paterfamilias as bold as brass in
chasing scrapes, while all the time quaking in
maudlin dread of his wife’s wrath. In her pros-
perity, the ex-burglaress remains faithful to Convict
Tom, refusing Benefactor Latimer for his strong
sake. But her mind changes when Tom breaks
gaol, and arrives, looking hideous, to command
her to cross the ocean with him next morning.
The lady refuses, and then the escapee chases
her round the table. Sometimes he catches her
and shakes her hard enough to toss down her
lovely auburn hair, and cause her diamonds to
heave on her snowy decolletage. But consider-
ing his desperate reputation, one feels a


little surprised that Thomas should be kept
at bay by one small woman sprinting
round a dining table. Then Latimer rushes in with
a revolver and casts the gaol-bird into outer
darkness (i.e., foreign parts) with two dollars
in his pocket. In the act of farewell, however,
the baffled miscreant hands over a poc-
ket-book with nasty reflections on Nance’s
character, plus slanderous data re the lady’s
past connection with his own burglarious
self. The philanthropist casts Nance off for
evah. Of course, he repents, but too late!
The wronged Innocent has disappeared. At
last, she arrives at the Ramsays’ lawn-party in
the uniform of a “Sister” in the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Harcourt
Beatty, whose grief at her absence has caused
him to look and dress exactly like chief-mourner
at a funeral, falls figuratively at her feet,
and all is cleared up at last. Then Nance, as a
celebrated actress, is persuaded to favor the com-
pany with a taste of her professional quality. The
ex-pickpocket, in pure, womanly tones, tells a
stupid little fable about a pipkin and a pot.
Nance, herself, stands for the pipkin, and benefac-
tor Latimer represents the philanthropic pot.
When they are married and living happily ever
afterwards, “Pipkin” and “Pot” must come
in conveniently for pet-names.
* * * *
In the earlier scenes of the play Nellie
Stewart gets some scope as a dare-devil baggage
of a girl. When the goody-goody stage sets in the
whole thing becomes too absurd to treat convinc-
ingly. _ Harcourt Beatty fails to do much with his
mawkish part. Always lacking in strength and
force of feeling, his present role has no use for his
intelligence. Mrs. G. B. W. Lewis is a lenient
stage-mother, while Miss Nannie Bennett and
Miss Willard present somewhat angular studies of
New York society girls.

Australia got its first impression of
“Veronique” at Her Majesty’s (Melb.) last
Saturday. The French opera is a straight-going
work in three acts, a modernised opera bouffe
rather than a new departure on musical-comedy
lines. It has a well-defined form, and a style of
its own —a dainty style calculated to grow in
"pspnkwtw and take some of the rough edge off .
the public fetsjte. The music and the story will
not immediately Fite the dull ear and tickle the
fancy of the multitude at large ; nevertheless,
the effective dressing and pretty backgrounds in
“Veronique” should win admiration until the
merits of the show as a whole are fully appreciated.
The libretto is seemingly a mild translation of a
naughty French original. Lauri and Miss Young
are a married pair who conduct an amazing
Parisian flower shop (a.d. 1840) with a chorus of
girl attendants. The lady has a Florestan (John
Doran) who formerly shared her endearments,
but he is about to make the usual marriage of
convenience on his own account. He and the
bride elect (Miss Thomas) meet for the first
time when she happens into the flower shop
(incognito) with her massive mama (Miss Clifton)
and overhears an incriminating conversation
between the young man and his giddy Madame.
Then she decides not to reject Florestan, but to
reform him, which —as she remarks to Mania—is
“much worse.” The two unknown ladies get
themselves taken on as extra hands at the crazy
•hop, and Florestan, who travels with a bailiff
(Bantock) in attendance, takes the whole establish-
ment to a picnic where he is going to marry. The
3rd act takes them to the Tuilleries to sign the
marriage contract, and then Florestan discovers
that his appointed girl is one with the other girl.
Therefore his matrimonial intentions become
strictly virtuous, and nothing is left for Miss
Young but to find another Florestan or live happily
ever afterwards with her lawful ridiculous Lauri.

Andre Messager’s music is more success-
fully treated by the orchestra under MacCann
than by the principal voices. Some of the choruses
were brightly sung on Saturday night; the solos,
duets, &c., lacked tune-color as a rule. The
singers sounded out of sympathy with their songs.
There was too much effort and not enough melody.
In the performance, apart from the singing, Lauri,
of the flower shop, took the honors as usual.
Miss Young and Miss Clifton did very well. Miss
Thomas was a rather magnificent sentimental
angel. Bantock, Percy, and Miss Milne met the
requirements, and John Doran was a tame
Lothario in strawberry continuations.

At Melbourne Bijou another Lauri —-
Edward, the strenuous endeavorer—is resorting
to his original character of Pineapple in “ A
Chinese Honeymoon.” Also, Miss May Beatty
is the same smudgy, tangle-headed Fi Fi as of
yore, and the other people are an improvement,
in some cases, on the co. that appeared at the
Princess’s when the “ Honeymoon ” was young
in the heavens, and the capers of Pineapple were
fresh cut.
At Melbourne Royal a number of little
tin gee-gees continue to rock themselves across
the distant landscape under the pretence of being
some actual live ’osses that clear a hurdle way
down by the orchestra. Bland Holt’s wondrous
Australian moraldrama is booked for another
week or so, and in the meantime Walter Baker is
an object of especial interest owing to a recent
performance in which he made a decided hit
before he hastily withdrew round the corner.
Facing the enemy’s gun at the Royal is a very
different matter to doing it in Bourke-street.

None of the other recent arrivals at
Melbourne Opera House are quite so well ap-
plauded as the handsome ’Murkan lady, briefly
described as Whitaker. The she-partner in
the Hill and Whitaker firm comes presum-
ably from the Soutli where de cotton grows,
and her humorous imitation of a niggah
man in a descriptive coon song is new to these
parts. Moreover, she has a beautiful rich voice.
Her ditty and her joyous smile are a comforting
reminder that a white gal can surpass our colored
brudder in his particular line of musical comedy.

The circuses are still inviting comparison
within easy smell of the Yarra; also Princes
Court stands where it did, and a Wild West Show
happens at the Cyclorama building. But Father
Robinson’s bazaar has run its course at the Town
Hall (where the Lyric Orchestral Society concerts
to-night, Thursday), prior to closing its art union
with a “draw ’’ on the 29th. The Bio-Tableau is
likewise out of Melbourne by this time, and the
Athenaeum Hall will be the home of the Gorriek
Family for one week, beginning on Saturday.

Adelaide Royal (swept and varnished, and
made fire-and-burglar proof) has been re-opened
by Charles Holloway, who unkindly depicts “The
Rogues of the Turf” for the edification of the
sports now returning from the loss of their money
at Flemington. Harry Rickards, in a speech
from the stage at his own little house, the Tivoli,
has expressed a wish to keep it open all the time,
instead of only in spasms. His present co. in-
cludes the musical Jacksons and Payen, the
automaton. It is rather a pity that the latter
gives his show away at the end, instead of leaving
the audience doubting whether it isn’t really a
machine after all, as the best Paris and London
figures mostly do. Miss Florence Challis works
hard to make a success of a very moderate London
ballad of the Old Bull and Busli. Someone ought
to write an Australian version and call it the “Old
Cow and Scrub” ; but the true inner significance of
a lady’s drinking “ port wine ” would be lost on a
local audience, anyway.
EXPLAINED.
“ Gran?papa, wot makes you get up so late?”
“ Faith, Terence, Oim an ould man now, an' Oi
shlape very slow.”
A little while ago, the N.S.W. Railway
Department wanted 10,000 chromo-lithographs
printed, and, though there is a splendid Govern-
ment printing-office in Sydney, it sent the work
to Switzerland. There was not a word of objec-
tion from the Freetrade section in N.S.W. State
Parliament about this. But when the Australian
Government proposed to send a stamp-printing
job to Adelaide, for the sake of economy, that
•ame section foamed with rage, and talked of
secession and other wild animals. The Carruthers
crowd is absolutely pleased to see employment
taken away from N.S.W. workers so long as it is
given to some foreigner, but when it hears of a job
going to S. Australia it raves like a lunatic who is
full of beer. Its one”consistent Federal principle
consists of a carefully cultivated hatred of every
part of Australia except N.S.W., and it hasn’t
any practical love for N.S.W. except when it
hears of some other State getting a job.

“VERONIQUE.”
There are lots of nice girls trimly skirted in green,
There are men in most various guise,
There’s a new sort of charm in each “ Veronique”
scene
Which appeals to the merry and wise.
There are heroines twain very gone on a man,
The first of three giddy gallants;
They gently dote on his lavender coat,
And adore his crushed-strawberry pants.
Many heroes are “dreams” on the opera stage,
For they wear irresistible togs,
To girls whose affections they freely engage
They are ever the gayest of dogs.
All the figures are gay in the musical play,
But the fellow who chiefly enchants
The susceptible fair sports a tight-fitting pair
Of the sweetest crushed-strawberry pants.

AT POVERTY POINT.
Grant Hervey, a writer whose ringing verses are well-
known to every reader of The Bulletin, helped to
provide Melbourne with a sensation last week, when he
shot a public-house in Bourke-street. Hervey is a very
large and powerful poet, and he was escorting Mrs. Baker
home. Walter Baker, who has suffered from unjust
suspicion for about 16 years in Bland Holt’s dramatic
company (mostly through the machinations of Albert
Norman whom Holt pays to bring Baker into trouble),
sighted them. Baker is a very large actor, and he seen s
to have plugged Hervey on the jaw before the latter had
any idea that hostilities had broken out. Baker next
seized his wife and started to run, while the half-stunned
writer reached for the atmosphere. Then recovering
himself he snatched out a “gun,” and as Baker
emerged from behind his wife and fled round a
corner, Hervey fired and hit a perfectly innocent public-
house. A detective fell on him just then, and as
Hervey pulled himself together and offered no
resistance, his intentions don’t seem to have been
generally ferocious. When Hervey had surrendered and
given up the revolver, the large figure of Baker re-
appeared round the corner and said things till the police-
man had to tell him not to “rub it in.” There was lan-
guage on both sides, but the professional actor had at
command all the lofty remarks he has been throwing at
Albert Norman in the drama for 16 years, and so had a
great advantage over the journalist. The charge was
“ shooting with intent to murder”, and bail was fixed at
£2OO. The public-house was not much damaged.
“S.”: Grant Hervey was fearfully excited after the
shooting case in Melbourne last week, and if he had let
himself go and shown that he was not himself he would
have been doing a wise thing. Instead he made a supreme
effort, gathered up the ends of his dancing nerves, pulled
himself together, and assumed an air of nonchalance that
will do him the greatest possible harm when the* case
comes before the court. Mrs. Baker, whose scream min-
gled with the report of Hervey’s revolver, disappeared as
soon as Hervey was arrested. She attended at the Police
Court next day, however, and smiled graciously on the
accused, who—perfectly composed and irreproachably
dressed, though he had spent the night in a cell in Little
Bourke-street—-bowed gracefully and smiled back at her.
They were allowed a few minutes’ conversation after the
proceedings were over, whereat Walter Baker must have
ground his teeth.
Walter Baker, who retreated in so masterly a way when
Grant Hervey fired a revolver at him, in Bo'urke-st., Mel-
bourne, last week, has a rather unusual record for bravery.
His first start was capturing an armed highwayman with
his naked hands, about 25 years ago. Baker was then an
assistant grocer in a baekblock town in N.S.W. He
chased his man four miles, and secured a Government
reward of £250. Later on, at Mount Bischoff, in Tasmania,
he rushed into a burning house and rescued a child, at
the peril of his life. His hair was all burnt off, and he
fell insensible after stumbling into safety with the young-
ster. He has also done some life-saving- by water.
“Neville Goyder ” writes:—“ ‘Petramos ’ (B. 2/11/’O5)
objects to Henry Irving’s signature on the score that it
looks like ‘lpecacuanha.’ I have in my possession a
letter and a sigiied photograph from the great actor, and
I can assure * Petramos ’ that the autograph resembles
nothing so much as the words ‘Henry Irving.’ In faet,•
the way Irving’s signature resembles his own name is quite
remarkable.”
Musg-rove has engaged a strong support for Nellie
Stewart through the American tour—capable performers
and striking as to appearance. It is understood that the
two Rignold sisters—Dora and Marie—will be divinely
tall members of the co., and the balance of style will have
to be maintained by at least a couple of heroic-looking
young men players. Musgrove’s idea seemingly is to give
Yankee journalism a great chance to boom “ Sweet Nell ”
as a beauty show, with the most decorative all-round
actress in the world as the star.
Miss Unie Russell was induced to sign on for another
six months with the Knight-Jeffries Go., after she had
given notice of her intention to quit. This re-engagement
seems to have been the outcome of Miss Unie’s sudden
appointment to the leading lady part in “ David Garrick,”
which she undertook at three days’ notice and played
very prettily.
“L.”: It seems just about time for the idea worked
out in “ Davy Garrick ” to take a long rest. Sixty years
ago Theophile Gautier complained that the French
theatres were frequently occupied by -‘the everlasting-
Story of Garrick, Talma, or Kean curing some foolish girl
of a passion for them as actors by exhibiting themselves
in private life under the most repulsive conditions.” At
about that time eight Paris playwrights almost simul-
taneously produced dramas founded on one of these
Garrick myths. Versions of most of their versions,
besides others derived from the German and from the
Kean plays referred to by Gautier, have since been in-
flicted on the English-speaking public when it wasn’t
strong enough to defend itself. Charles Reade and half-
a-dozen others have rung the chang-es on the story by
the leading- character an actress—usually Mrs.
Bracegirdle. If the tired old legend is not to be allowed
to totter toothless to its tomb just yet, a revival-of one
of these last-mentiohed.plays, in which the.limelight is
not all intended for.a beauty actof with- incredible legs,
would be an acceptable change.
“ F.C.” : I wish to vent a grievance against the manage ■
inent of Princes’ Court, Melbourne. The chute chutes
all right, and the Jap girls, who aren’t Jap, are nice
enough, also the helter-skelter has no tacks where they
shouldn’t be ; but I reckon “Dastro” has deceived me.
D., aforesaid, a firm-faced gentleman of Australian ex-
traction, rides a bike down a chute 60ft long with a 35ft.
drop, then shoots up a strip, rising 2ft. in 9ft., then
slithers across a vacant space to where the tail end of his
“chute” is, and so to the ground. This gap, or chasm,
measured just 27ft., and Dastro found by experience
that he landed about 10ft. over it, so one night he
shifted the tail end of his chute further away,
making the gap 40ft. Perhaps this was too large
a shift; anyhow, when he shot down in his usual
hurry, the planks he expected to laud on weren’t
there, and a surprised Dastro collided with
cinders and gravel. Now my grievance is that I have
witnessed the performance several times without experi-
encing any thrill—it seems quite easy when .you see it
done —and when there was a chance of a sensation, the
management failed to properly advertise it. And to think
that for a wretched sprat I might have had the chance of
seeing a man killed ! Certainly he wasn’t killed, nor even
seriously damaged, hut that wasn’t his fault. If he is
going to lengthen his chasm and attempt suicide again I
want to be there. It’s the cheapest thrill I know of, and
I’m a whale for cheap thrills.
The other week when Horace Lingard produced “Our
Boys ” in Melbourne, he stated that H. J. Byron’s widow
is badly in need of any copyright fees she can get from
such occasional performances of her late husband’s plays.
11. J. Byron’s work continues to provide sport for
amateurs, who never recognise the widow’s claim in the
matter. Amateur theatrical managements have always
been audaciously piratical, except when they produced,
say, a Gilbert and Sullivan opera by arrangement with
J.C.W., and he, by the way, is no longer willing to let
his goods out on hire to rival speculators. A move
against the pirates was lately made by J. A. Miller, of
Melbourne, acting as attorney for Samuel French and Co.,
of London. Thusfar, Miller has got a promise of co-
operation from none of the amateur competition promo-
ters except the A.N.A. National Fete Committee. In
reply to his letter stating the case for French and Coi’s
copyrights, the A.N.A. committee promised that amateur
companies entering for competitions will be required to
show the consent of the author’s agents before they
can produce any comedy on which a fee is chargeable.
Dan Barry lately won a country editor’s heart, and
the Areas Express (Gladstone, S.A.) printed the
following “ The drama ‘ The Prisoner of War,’ or ‘ The
Russian Spy,’ which Dan Barry’s company is to play on
Wednesday night next, in the Institute Hall, Glad-
stone, is likely to draw a record house, especially
as the combination is headed by the genial and gifted
actor-manager himself. Incidents connected with the
momentous Russo-Japanese war are the main features
of the play, so that it can be understood as being
up-to-date. It is now the reigning dramatic furore in
the Old Country, and such has been its success that the
author is said to have netted £6OOO for his share of the
profits out of the first two months of its production in
London. From its initial performance in that city it
made a profound impression ; all classes of playgoers have
rushed to see it in thousands., Even clergymen and
others who do not as a rule visit theatres have not been
able to resist the fascination which the play seems to
exercise.”
In a recent comedy, “ What the Butler Saw,” a giddy
husband sums up marriage as “ one of those blessings a
man gets so accustomed to that they are apt to slip his
memory.”
“ Skull ” : Among Australian actors Walter Baker is
easily first as a pedestrian. A long experience of Walter
leaves in my mind an excellent impression of him as a
footracer. He is always starting from scratch. You have
a mental picture of him posing in the wings toeing the
mark, impatiently waiting the starter’s pistol. Crack !
and on bounds the hero. After that throughout the piece
W.B. is continually waiting for the word “go,” and then
going like a sprinter out after records. He jumps from
mark at all sorts of situations. He runs on, he runs off,
he makes false runs and goes through preliminary
canters, and it is not his fault if every piece has not a long
run. No wonder there is a popular idea that Walter is a
dashing actor. He makes more dashes in the course of
five acts than half-a-dozen ordinarily energetic heroes.
“F.”: Anent “Oxo” and stars with mothers in the,
chorus (B. 12/10/’O5). In all stage crowds, in pieces in
which G. V. Brooke appeared at old Melbourne Royal,
“Mrs. G. V. Brooke” —not Avonia Jones —always made
one.
Early in her career Ellen Terry was known as Nellie
Terry, but decided that her formal name was better
suited to the parts she undertook. Perhaps Australia’s
leading Nellie will make the same change if she takes
altogether to tragedy.
“ T.D.”: Met Boris Hambourg and the other pro-
fessional, pa Hambourg, the other night. Mark is
away shekel-making in S’Africa. The brothers will pro-
bably revisit Australia in the near future, and may then
take their father with them. He is a fine, handsome,
shaggy old Continental, with greying chin and lip adorn-
ments on Napoleon the Little lines. Mark and Boris
declare, however, that they won’t take the old man with
them, as, so long as he’s about, they do not get their
proper share of feminine petting. Incidentally, there is a
Jan Hambourg, who fiddles successfully at English con-
certs. He stands between Mark and Boris in point of
age. Can this be the Jakoff of the earliest Hambourg
tour in Australia?
“ O K.” : Satisfactory to hear that when Julius Knight
was making a farewell speech, at Melbourne Princess’s,
he merely destroyed a bit of blue silk sash by twisting it
nervously round his fingers. When he attempted a first-
night speech, at Her Majesty’s, some two or three years
ago, Julius hung on to the hand of Miss Jeffries and
twisted that round his finger until the lady’s countenance
expressed agony and scorn.
Bernard Shaw’s latest, “Passion, Poison, and Petri-
faction, or the Fatal Gazogene,” is a quaint satire on
various styles of bellowdrama. The play, announced as
“ by the Chelsea Shakspeare, George Bernard Shaw,” was
performed in a tent at a recent garden party in aid of the
English Actors’ Orphanage fund. G. P. Huntley and
other leading mummers were in the cast. Early in the
play Lady Magnesia FitzTollemaehe goes to bed on the
stage, still retaining her hat and parasol—evidently a slap
at bed scenes in “ Camille,” “ Pretty Peggy,” etc. She is
awakened by her husband,trying to stab her with a dagger,
which he weakly attempts to pass off as a new fish-slice.
Enter Adolphus Bastable, arrayed in magenta and puce,
instead of the ordinary black and white evening-dress of
Sassiety, so that nobody will ever again be able to take
him for a waiter. The villainous FitzTollemaehe, enraged
at being foiled in the attempt on his wife, treats Adol-
phus to whisky diluted from a poisoned gazogene. Fitz-
Tollemache suddenly repents, and gives Adolphus some
lime from the ceiling as an antidote, but an -over-dose of
it solidifies within him, and turns him to stone. Various
minor murders and suicides happen in between, and
throughout the play a “Chorus of Invisible Angels ” gives
assistance. The closing scenes consist of a series of
sudden deaths, accompanied by the squawking- of Zion’s
white-robed choir. Altogether, the drama ought to be a
howling success with the connoisseurs who appreciate
“The Booziest Bounder in Bendigo ” and “The Leg at
the Loophole.”
Melbourne Johnnydom is dying or dead. Father
Robinson, prince of promoters, wishful of making his
bazaar in Melbourne Town Hall rake in large masses of
shekels, induced the Royal Comic Opera Company to run
the show for him one afternoon. From past experience
of such things he figured out that straw-hatted, high-
collared, tan-booted Johnnydom, in its new Cup suit,
would roll up in hundreds, mournfully mouth its silver-
headed stick, and hand over its wealth for pin-cushions
and flowers and bottles of scent and raffle-tickets, sold
with a smile and a word by a footlight charmer. But,
alas ! the fowler’s snare caught almost nothing. The
brightest of the chorus, and all the principals, turned out
in swell frocks and witching smiles—but Johnnydom
came not. About 150 people wandered into the Town
Hall and listened to the singing of the company stars.
The chorus girls ivere disconsolate, and early in the after-
noon gave up the job of trying to sell dear nothings to
dowdy women and green-grocery-looking men. The
cleric’s little ruse had failed, and his faith in human
nature was shaken to the plinth. There is no more
Johnnydom.
An Australian contralto who promises to get a tangible
hold on the British market is Miss Maud Dalrymple, of
Sydney, who has just made her first London appearance
at Henry Wood’s promenade concerts. Her voice,
although shaken a little through nervousness, gave evi-
dence of such quality that she bad to repeat her bow
four times after her first song. The good-looking Maud
has booked several good London -engagements for the
winter season, including one or two of the Chappell
ballad concerts.
“ Pro.”: Even slang words have their fine distinc-

means the introduction of extraneous stuff. Ponging is

The omens at last point to the amiable
Ministry getting on the right fiscal track. The
best finger post to the right track is, of course, the
right brand-—D.C.L. The Ministry which assists
itself in moderate quantities to the Whisky of the
Wise, is clearly assisting itself to a wise policy.
Needless to say that it is the duty of an inspired
D.C.L. Ministry to pass the bottle to the Opposi-
tion.*

The oldest house but one on the North
Shore of Sydney Harbor, “The Hangers,” at
Mosman, is about to come under the hammer.
The picturesque and quaint structure, with its
belfry, was built about the year 1840 by Oswald
Bloxsome, who had a grazing property in the
Liverpool Ranges. In or about the year 1846
Oswald Brierley, the marine artist, was a guest,
in ill health, and as a pastime he painted on the
dining-room wall a picture of the Rattlesnake in a
A BARGAIN.

Any more casual person than the smal
boy has yet to be found. Witness the experience
of a Camperdown (Vic. ) parson, as recorded in the
Argus the other day. Parson, driving past a deep
waterhole, saw a youngster playing on the bank,
and pulled up to warn him that he might fall in.
“My brother’s in already,” the nipper replied
brightly, and went on scraping mud. ihe parson
was lust in time to hsh out a youngster who
seemed to be going down for the last time. The
kid on the bank hadn’t thought the incident worth
mentioning until the parson interfered.
In other days, the ghost of Michael O’Byrne
would have walked William-street, Sydney. Mick,
when in the flesh and flush of cash, willed the
Bible Hall, standing half-way up that street, to
the R.C. Church authorities, and fixed a sum to
be wholly devoted to Bible exposition. After a
time, the interest in Bible exposition fell off, and,
as it was no good expounding without an audience,
the authorities decided to, if allowed, devote the
money, or part of it, to secular education. The
Equity Court has had a long wrestle with Mick’s
ghost, but, last week, Justice A. H. Simpson pro-
nounced that the ghost should fall into line with
modern ideas, and £5O a-year of the late rum-
seller’s hoardings will consequently go to the
secular education of children. Somehow the
ghosts of the dead, meaning thereby their wills,
are losing their grip of the world, and their threat
to walk about with a sheet around them if their
directions about the cash should be neglected are
scorned. Nowadays, a tram-car would as soon
run over a ghost as not.

The enthusiastic efforts of William Malone
to go on the land out Deniliquin way (N.S.W.),
are unhappily ended. In 1900 Malone applied for
an annual lease of a bit of land held by O’Keefe
under an occupation license. The Lands Appeal
Court in a friendly way booted O’Keefe off and
Malone entered on his land, renewing the lease
every succeeding year. The indignant O’Keefe
appealed to a Supreme Court Judge, who ordered
Malone off the land. Whereupon Malone put the
case to the Full Court, which ordered O’Keefe off
the land. O’Keefe trumped Malone’s trick by per-
suading the Privy Council to reverse the Full
Court’s ruling, and once more Malone was ordered
off the land. Giving O’Keefe best, the unflagging
Malone sued “the Crown” for a refund of the
money paid as rent for land he was not legally in
possession of, which claim ambled round the courts
until it came before the Full one. Unabashed
by the fact that its previous finding in the case had
been knocked endways, the Full Court announced
that the whole thing was as simple as possible. A
large and special rock on which the British Con-
stitution rests is that no one can recover on a mis-
take of law. Everyone—the Minister, the Lands
Department, the Lands Court, Malone, and others
(others being the august Full Court itself)—had
mistaken the law, and that ended it. Malone
must pay the costs. Malone is no longer on the
land, but O’ Keefe is, so the progress of land settle-
ment is not quite paralysed.

“ Edyson ” : Saw a bulky and con-
spicuous politician make a spectacle
of himself in Swanston-street, re-
cently, before an enthusiastic
audience. He was progressing
towards Flinders-street with
the air of a man who had
come out to see how his
globe was getting on,
when a small liver-
and-old-gold terrier
attacked him. There
was no reason why
the terrier should
attack him, unless
it realised that he
was putting on
too much dog.
Anyhow, it
jumped at the
enormous states-
men, and hooked
itself to the back
of his pants.
Whereat the
mighty meaty
man lost his sense
of importance, ut-
tered a cry of agon-
ised apprehension,
and whirled round.
The dog held, and the man
rotated on his pivot five
times, with dog streaming
out in circles all round
him. At the sixth revolu-
tion the dog flew out of its
orbit and landed far out
in the middle of the road.
It returned to the charge.
The politician rushed
feebly at it and fell down.
Sitting exhausted on the
pavement and looking
vainly for his enemy
he cried piteously,
‘ ‘ Where’s the dog ?
Where’s the dog?”
“ Please, Mister, yer
sittin’ on him,” said a
small boy. At this
point a policeman ar-
rived, threw the dog
into June, 1906, and
helped a breathless
public man into a ciib.
“A movement is on foot” (by the wayy
why don’t movements sometimes goby train, or
’bus, or motor-car, or something, for a change ?) to
have Balmain called a city. It used to be a plea-
sant old place, where sea-captains settled down
and spun yarns; but in its smoky dusty noisy
days it wants to put on dog, and “ the Mayor is
at the head of the movement.” Just what good it
will do Balmain, supposing the movement
arrives, isn’t mentioned. What is most likely
to happen is that the precious Mayor and
councillors will wear some extra frill, and will
want an extra coat of paint put upon the
unnecessary town hall, and another coat of
varnish provided for the cupboard that Balmain
could very well do without; and consequently
they will yap more angrily than ever at any pro-
posal to wipe out all the unnecessary town halls,
and cupboards, and the 43 or 44 little suburban
mayors of no consequence, and the same number
of council clerks. And as all this would postpone
the coming of a Greater Sydney, The Bulletin
hopes that the movement, and every other one like
it, will get corns and spring-halt and other infirmi-
ties, so that it will be on foot no longer. On
the other hand, if the mayor and his dusty
suburb of Balmain are not simply after
ham-frill, and want to do something of
real yalue, they might tackle Balmain’s debt.
The place owes £11,500, which is costing over 4
per cent, a year, and another £59,000, which is
costing over 5 per cent, a year, besides a good
amount of floating debt, and of the whole lot only
a poor little £3500 is represented by anything that
can ever earn any interest, apart from the Town
Hall. And though all this debt is represented by
dead works, Balmain hasn’t got anything in the
shape of a sinking fund—-it pays something off
when it feels that way, and when it doesn’t feel
that way it just borrows some more, and mean-
time is paying away about a fourth of its whole
revenue in interest. And all it can think of doing
in those circumstances is “ to set a movement on
foot ”to get itself called a city. The Bulletin’s
view is that every municipa'lty which is clean
and out of debt should be a city, and should have
a Lord Mayor if it wants one. If it gets into debt
again it should become only a town with a mayor,
and when the debt gets past a certain point it
should become officially a hovel, and its muni-
cipal head should be just called Bumble or Dog-
berry.

Sydney Morning Herald, noting Chief
Justice Darley’s appointment to the English Privy
Council, said “it would be felt that his Honor
had established a claim to the call to the inner
councils of the Empire.” As a matter of fact, to
be a Privy Councillor to-day is merely an empty
honor. The Privy Council is never called upon
now to confer with and advise the Sovereign, and
the Sovereign doesn’t know most of its members
from a herd of cattle. The alleged position carries
with it the prefix of “Right Honorable” and
nothing more. It doesn’t even confer a free rail-
way pass.
AFTER THE CUP.
OWNBR: “ Well, Billy, you nearly won ?”
BILLY: “ Yes, sir, it was a dose thing. I couldn't
have held im much longer .”
Recently the Westralian Government im-
ported a man from Queensland as chief director of
Agriculture at £750 and a liberal travelling allow-
ance. His predecessor, who was not considered
good enough for the billet, was placed in charge of
the Rabbit Department, and draws nearly as
much salary as the new man, who was a jour-
nalist, or something of that sort, in Bananaland
His reports supply Perth papers with many
columns of free copy. Here’s a sample from one
of his latest lucubrations, a pretty fair sample of
the lot:
It is evident that the progress of agriculture in the
future must be along lines of intellectual achievement,
and the fanner, to be successful, must use his brains as
well as his hands. We have crossed the Rubicon which
separates the kingdoms of brawn and brain ; henceforth
and for evermore agriculture will be ruled and directed
from the kingdom of brain. The gospel of agriculture
must be preached, and then, under the new dispensation,
there shall be an awakening in the new agriculture in all
our rural districts.
Which is very large and beautiful and eloquent,
but, unhappily, you can’t grow ’taters on an
epigram or feed cows on a peroration. Westralia
still fails to supply itself with its own vegetables,
yet it is the only State where the Agricultural
Department beats Demosthenes and leaves Cicero
panting in the rear.

‘Twas in the crowd upon the Block,
The tall man stood in front of me.
Six p.m. said the Town Hall clock
A week ago come Saturdee. *> -
He was a human monster that -
Stood six foot six, or pretty nigh,
He wore a glossy topper hat
And great glass window on his eye.
His ribs were wrapped in square-cut coat,
A brolly dangled from his arm,
His tartan tie and collared throat
Lent extra lustre to his charm.
Race glasses on his arm hung free.
It seemed he’d come straight from the course,
So I approached quite modestly
(I had a shilling on a horse).
I looked the long slab down and up,
Then humbly and politely spoke :
“Mister, what won the Valley Cup
(I’ve got a deener on the tote) ? ”
He handed down a withering stare.
It pierced me to the very marrow.
“ I nevah back demmed horses, sir,
I’ve been to Henley-on-the-Yarra.”

The capsizing of a punt on the Saltwater
River gave the Melbourne journals a fine chance
to improve the gloomy item. In the first place it
was announced as a wholesale Cup Day tragedy—
“ Several persons drowned—two bodies recovered.”
Next day’s scare-headings stated that the police
were still dragging the river for human corpses,
but had as yet only succeeded in recovering the
bodies of sundry cows, sheep and dogs. Then
slowly and reluctantly the press admitted that
the two persons first mentioned were the only
victims of the tragedy. The police had been
dragging the river for bodies that were merely
drowned in the waters of newspaper fiction.

Before N.S. W. Arbitration Court, recently,
a coal-lumper confessed to having worked
hours at a stretch. “ Without a sleep ?” inquired
the Court, in astonishment. “ Without a sleep,
without a wash, and without taking my clothes
off,” supplemented witness. “Ever have any
other long shifts?” inquired barrister Hughes.
“ Yes ; I’ve worked so long in a week that there
were only seven hours left for sleep.” “You’re
an extraordinary man to be able to do it,” com-
mented Judge Heydon.

Even the Law acquires a placid, gradual
habit in the sleepy town of Geelong. The other
Sunday afternoon a delinquent, suspected of
insulting behavior, moved somewhat rapidly
down the main street ahead of a policeman, peeled
off, and fled into the bay. The Sunday pro-
menaders were interested, and offered frequent
advice, but the Law took up a masterly attitude
on the discarded garments, fixed its eye on the
swimmer roving to and fro, and dwelt thus for
the space of two hours. The shivering youth was
on the point of collapse once or twice, but the
Law merely observed that it was much drier and
warmer on shore, and that everything was pre-
, pared for bis reception. Masterly inactivity

Cabled that the Jews of England and
America are organising to send relief to their
kindred in Russia who have suffered in the recent
outbreaks. The sort of relief the Jews in Russia
want is the ability to put up a gory fight that
would put the fear of death in the hearts of the
ruffian mob. South Russia is full of Tartars,
who are, in the bulk, an inferior race. But you never

read of “hooligans” organising attacks on the Tartar
portion of a town. The Tartar puts up such a scrum
that there is neither fun nor profit in attacking
him. If a Jewish quarter, just for once, would
deal out sudden eternity and wholesale mutilation
to an attacking mob, the people of that district
would think long and solemnly before they tried
to get fun out of Jew-baiting again.

Chinamen are the
most frequent offen-
ders. A woman
mostly faces towards
the rear of the car
when alighting.
Should the vehicle
move at the time, a
blood-curdling shriek
stabs through the din
as she frantically
endeavors to cover
a few inches of ex-
posed stocking re-
gardless of the fact
that the wheels are

The expression I

A notably heroic deed last week was that
of William Ferrier, who, the brigantine Bella
being wrecked at Warrnambool (Vic.), went out
in his little dingy, rowing with one oar through
seas that the lifeboat dared not face, and brought
two men off the ship. Ferrier is a fisherman—one
of the very few fishermen in Australia, which in
the main allows its sea-harvests to go untilled
whilst it imports tinned and salted fish from
abroad. Thereby it gets poorer food and more
ptomaines, and loses the chance of a big fisher
population, of all folk the most heroic in peace
and war.

At last Thursday’s sitting of the Melb.

The namby-pamby Woman’s Page of S.M.
Herald has broken out afresh :
Sons of Japanese gentlemen are sent to Townsville in
numbers to learn the English language. To support
themselves they take positions as cooks, waiters, or
domestic servants. They are refined young men, and very
grateful to anyone who is kind to them ... A highly
educated Australian girl had a night-school until recently
in Townsville for the Japanese cooks, waiters, etc. The
“ boys ” always behaved well, and got on capitally with
their lessons . . . The moral teaching of the Bible is to
them very unimportant. . . When the teacher’s birthday
came round her pupils presented her with a pink silk
nightgown, a beautifully embroidered garment. They
were much concerned as to the fit of the sleeves.
Yes, they don’t worry much about the moral
teaching of the Bible, but they do take a wonder-
ful interest in the white woman’s bed-costume.
The police crusade against publicans in
Brisbane is giving the local police-court beak
quite a rush of business, and the J.P. is looking
more ponderously wise than usual. The other
day a man was fined for “drinking on a Sunday,”
but the publican, on the same evidence, was
acquitted. The curious part of the business was
that the evidence only showed the man had a
frothing tankard at his elbow when the police
entered. The publican said the-drink was for the
cook. As the Bench let the publican go, the in-
ference is that in. his case they believed the cook
part of the affair, but didn’t believe it as applied
to the other fellow. Also the fact that the pot
was full seemed to be regarded as proof that the
accused had drunk part of its contents. The ways
of the J.P. mind are like the track of a serpent
which leaves no footmark on the rock.

Sydney Telegraph lets loose a fiery, un-
tamed poet to mourn over the sadness of the results
of Federation. He records that at the inauguration
of the Commonwealth —
Let that poet cheer up. When the “mountains
circling danced” at the inauguration of the Com-
monwealth, it was because of the vast quantity of
champagne that Bill Lyne had poured out. Now
that the mountains have settled down to “stand in
silent dignity,” it’s really better for the country. A
mountain when standing can be used for fruit-grow-
ing, or pasture, or residence. A mountain cutting
giddy capers is no use to man or beast. Indeed,
one of the reasons why The Bulletin supports
Federation is that under Federation the moun-
tains are so quiet and dignified.
The Rev. F. W. Walker has great hopes
of Adelaide as a fishing-ground for the £25,000
which he wants to raise in Australia to run his
“ Papuan Industries, Ltd.,” Adelaide being a
place which can mix God and Mammon. with a
particularly deft hand. Apropos which, the S.M.
1 lerald apparently struck a snag in .Randolph
Bedford’s last “Circled Continent” article, for
the customary instalment didn’t show up on
Saturday, Nov. 4th. Brisbane Courier pub-
lished it, however, and the text explains the
Herald’s outburst of silence. For Bedford
slashed out at two things that the Herald always
takes off its hat to—the missionary business and
“ const’tooshnal authority.” For instance :
Sir William Macgregor—strong.man as he was—lifted
the Possession into the promise of good government and
development ; but after him, excepting the luo.'dess
Christopher Robinson, the Governments were admirable
considered as orphanages and creches for tired mission-
aries, but farcical in any of their attempts to give Aus-
tralia interest for its money by easing the difficulties of
the white settler.
A blast against two sacred institutions in one sen-
tence—no wonder the Herald held its breath,
and didn’t recover it till the Saturday issue was
out, and it felt sure that the awful sacrilege
hadn’t crept in somehow while it wasn’t looking !
The Papuan law allows missionaries to take all
the natives they require without indentures or
payment so long as they take them for “educa-
tional purposes”; the ordinary person who isn’t
a missionary has, of course, to sign indentures,
pay his boys, and return them when done with.
Yet, according to Bedford—-
At one mission station a number of boys are finding
“ education ” in the missionary saw-mill, which takes
Government contracts for timber, and so competes with
white labor or the white employer who pays his brown
helpers; at the same station the price of boatbuilding
per foot has been so cut by the owners of the unpaid
Papuan for “ education purposes ” that the white boat-
builder is cut out of the trade.
Under that sort of law there ought to be pretty
good dividends in Papuan Industries, Limited—
always provided it mixes God and Mammon in the
right proportions.
Bedford’s yarn recalls the evidence given in a
case heard at Samarai (British Papua) a while ago,
and reported in the Endeavor Beacon, of Cook-
town. It was a case brought by A. S. Meek
against the Rev. C. A. Abel—and the Rev. F. W.
Walker, of Papuan Industries, Limited, appears,
to have been locum tcnens for the other brother in
the vineyard, which was a cowyard in this instance.
This Meek thought to start in business as a dairy-
man at Samarai, and, as Brother Abel was in
the business already, he tried to come to terms
with his only competitor. Meek’s story was that
they did come to terms; the missionary’s story
was that, when Meek bought a young bull and
four calves from the missionary for £5l, and other
cattle on liberal terms, he wasn’t buying the good-
will of the business, but only bull and calves ; and
when the missionary continued to send the milk-
can round Samarai, they went to law. The mis-
sionary won, but that is of no consequence ; the
interesting fact is that, according to the report in
the Cooktown paper, Missionary Abel swore—
I sold some cattle to Mr. Meek. I got a fair value.
After selling I left for England. Mr. Walker acted for me
during my absence. I left instructions, which were that
I had had a conversation with Mr. Meek, saying that I
would give him a fair start, and that as soon as Mr. Meek
was ready he was to inform Mr. Walker, and he would
allow him an open field. I made no promise to stop
sending milk. My milk supply to Samarai has never
ceased to my knowledge.
What Missionary Abel paid his “boys,” or
whether they were receiving an education in cow-
raising, and consequently didn’t call for such base
reward as wages, didn't transpire; possibly in
this case he did pay them—there is, anyhow, no
evidence to the contrary. All the same, the mis-
sionary is still Samarai’s milkman (or was till
recently); and the mere lay trader has retired,
beaten. He evidently didn’t know the right pro-
portions in which to mix God and Mammon.

John Johnson, the North Shore (Sydney)
contractor who suicided a few days ago, leaving
five children to his sister’s care and a frantic letter
to a barmaid, had a romance in his life. As a
lonelv widower he sought the love of a girl who
dispensed liquids at a Chatswood pub., and after
a courtship which included handsome presents to
the lady and bushels of letters, a marriage was
arranged. The wedding guests assembled, and
the wedding garment was starched and ironed,
and the feast was ready, but the girl who used to
dispense fluid refreshment at the bar came not.
She was a minus quantity and a vanished memory,
She didn’t even leave her other hair hanging on
a nail. A week or two later she was arrested,
while jerking beer at a new bar, and charged with
getting goods under false pretences. The defence
consisted chiefly of scoffing remarks by P. Crick
about the bridegroom’s age. Johnson professed to
take it all philosophically, but he took drink with
it, and the end was sudden. The letter that he
left for the girl—a languid-looking girl in expen-
sive clothes and with great possibilities in the way
of fat—was pathetic but not reproachful. The
poor devil loved her.

The Melbourne p’liceman’s daily beat
With sinful steps is trod ;
He giveth heed to cold and heat—
He meditates on drink and meat—
But O, the bobby on his beat
Gives little heed to God.
From month to month the same old round
The serg-eant stern must plod.
In summer time his face is browned,
In winter o’er the muddy ground
He goes his weary worldly round,
Nor ever praises God.
At some among the careless throng
He condescends to nod.
They whistle as they walk along,
They hum, perchance, a comic song :
But none among the careless throng
Remind him of his God.

From sordid thoughts of “ quod.”

Or smoke beneath a shady tree.

A YOUNG man and a maiden
Upon the grass reclined;
With tears her eyes were laden —
He didn't seem to mind.
He watched the clouds sail over,
And smoked in peace profound;
She plucked the sweet white clover,
And gazed upon the ground.
To me she looked bewitching

To pull—or stroke —his hair.
'Twas easy to discover
That each one suffered pain —
Ah me, to be a Lover,
And suffer so again!

Thine ocean laughed for joy, and all thy shores
Resounded gleefully ; the towering cliffs,
And deep-set, tree-filled vales had voice and sang ;
The rivers joined in tune ; while, hand in hand,
The mountains circling danced.
But now the difference :
Thine ocean smiles not, and its sea-washed sand
In sympathy is still ; silent are all
Thy cliffs and foliaged vales ; with mournful sound
The rivers flow ; in silent dignity
The mountains stand ; and all the pleasant fields
Share in the sorrow of the Austral sun,
As disappointment, nay, revulsion reigns.

Since 1860 N.S.W. has derived £50,046,052 from
the sale of public lands. Asa matter of very ordinary
honesty, the money, being- the proceeds of the sale of
assets, should have been put into other assets ; and if
this had been done, and non-productive works—such as
roads, culverts, and public buildings—had been paid for
out of revenue, as they should have been, N.S.W. would
have had all the public works it now possesses, and its
debt, instead of being- £53,(162,432 (0r£80,242,246 exclusive
of alleged value of works, &c., transferred to the Common-
wealth), would have amounted to only £15,440,040. In
i t ion'oo'o < S’, ’ n ,^ e P asfc 45 years N.S.W. has raised
£130,288,808 by tile sale of assets or by loans, and all it
has to show for it in the way of “ permanent and repro-
works” are undertakings that have cost
±05,486,692; and even those don’t earn full interest, not
to mention sinking fund.
The total amount of capital which N.S. Wales
has fooled away in 45 years has been £64,802,206. Most
of this is now represented by nothing whatever ; it has
been used to pay the policeman and to provide for public
drunks that are long- since forgotten. A little of it has
been put into public building-s, and roads, and culverts,
but that is a mere fleabite. The vast bulk of it
just upon £60,000,000 has been collared and
improperly used as revenue. The borrowing mad-
ness has been such a blastiferous thing that N. S.
Wales has never attempted to honestly face the
consequences ; it has dodged them, and still continues to
i dodge them, by selling its assets and paying Cohen with
the proceeds. The interest on the N.S.W. public debt
now amounts to £2,856,872 a year, and on temporary
loans to another £194,145. On the average of the past 10
years, £1,150,000 of this has been raised annually by selling
assets. Tlie debt is growing, the interest is growing, and the
assets are shrinking ; and the time is coming when, even
if borrowing- absolutely ceases now, another £1,150,000
will have to be raised in taxes to pay the interest ’bill
for want of assets to sell. If borrowing doesn’t cease
and the money is put into things which don’t
return interest and sinking- fund (and there is practically
no public undertakings which do), then something more
than £1,150,00G of extra taxes will have.to be raised when
the land assets are all sold. N.S. Wales has never yet
felt the full results of its foreign debt, because it has so
tar had assets to sell, with the proceeds of which it has
paid from one-half to one-third of the interest # but the
fact that it has now to buy back estates in order tb find
land for settlementproves that it is getting near the end
of its- tether, and that the assets it can sell are peterin°-
out. And when they do peter out for good, and N.S.
Wales has to collect another £4 or so per household
annually in taxation, and provide absolutely nothing in
return for it, then the State will probably begin to see
the real beauties of the borrowing system.
Though its public debt per bead is not the greatest
among the States, N.S.W. is in this other respect the worst.
offender, so a change to honesty (and it will have to be
honest some day when it has no more assets left to be
dishonest with) will give it,a worse bump than any other
State. This list shows for 1904 the interest charges
payable by each State, and the proportion of it dishonestly
paid out of the sale of assets

So N.S.W. shows up as the boss loafer of the group ; as the
conspicuous example of shiftlessness, selfishness, mean-
ness, and financial incapacity ; as the State which, above
all others, is living- on its capital, and doing- all those
things which inevitably lead to bankruptcy, and generally
result in the bankrupt being refused his certificate. And
Carruthers, the Reform Treasurer, has not reformed this
practice worth a cent ; he goes on piling- up debt, and
selling land, and using the proceeds in the same dishonest
way, and generally hurrying on the time when the whole
business will have to stop with a smash, and a dazed
people will simply have to put their hands in their pockets
and pay up—or default.

Employers’ liability laws have given accident
insurance business a long lift during the past few years ;
and there has been big money in it for the offices that
have been on the spot with their books open, and have
had the data to work on. But it appears to have been
easy enough to make mistakes. The big Ocean Cos.,
going into the guarantee business under the new English
Employers’ Liability Act (and this business is first cousin
to accident insurance), made a loss of £49,936 in 19D2.
Then it altered its rates, f mad out what business wasn’t
worth taking at any price, and soon got into profits again.
In Australasia the New Zealand Accident Cos. has been by
far the most successful. It began with a paid-up capital
of £2OOO ; but little by little profits have been capitalised
until capital now stands at £62,500 ; and the net earnings
last year ran to £33,816. This energetic co.’s recent
record of profit has been as follows :
1895 .. £6,118 1900 .. £9,082
1896 ... 7,286 . 1901 .. 15,465
1897 .. 8,080 1902 .. 15,385
1898 .. 12,210 1903 .. 27 674
1899 .. '11,898 1904 .. . 33,816
The co. says that it is all on account of its fine organisa-
tion ; and there is little doubt that there isn’t another
branch of insurance business wherein experience and
organisation and the constant accumulation of data count
for more. The accident insurance co. has its rates and
tariffs,-of course ; but they are subject to constant modi-
fications to meet special circumstances. Men working for
one stevedore, for instance, can get accident cover
at a rate which an office wouldn’t look at
if offered by the men working for another stevedore,
handling the same sort of cargo in the same port. And
only experience can separate one stevedore from another.
But, allowing for the “pull” that a few years spent in
the business gives, other insurance co.’s have lately been
hankering after this flesh-pot, and don’t see any reason
Why they shouldn’t make money that way, too. The two
big Maoriland co.’s are especially keen in the matter.
The Maoriland Government has an accident insurance
department, which last year showed a profit of £5418 ;
and as the M.L. Insurance Department has now gone into
the fire business, and thus trodden heavily on the co.s’
corns, the co. ’s are on the look-out for ways to return
the-tread. Therefore, at its last annual meeting, a few
weeks ago, the South British 00. altered its rules so as to
allow it to take any risks except life ; and now the bio-
New Zealand Insurance Cos. is absorbing the N.Z. Accident
Insurance Cos., or amalgamating- with it, or somethin<>-
of the sort,- with a view to pushing matters. And on the
Australian side one or two of the sprightly fire and
marine offices have been looking in the direction of the
accident and guarantee business, and will probably make
announcements on the subject before long. All this
activity is a good thing, anyhow. It is preposterous that
a man of some means should quite as a matter of course
insure his house and his ship and his horse and his
furniture and his plate-glass window, while the laborer
whose labor is the only thing standing between his familv
and destitution, should go through life with his whole
capital uninsured.

Last week’s cable, reporting that the New
York Insurance Department had determined the surplus
of the Equitable Life office at the reduced amount of
62,000,000 dollars (£13,250,000), does not say the last word
on the question. There is a more elaborate inquiry
proceeding—not conducted by politicians, but by experts
appointed by Congress. As, however, the Insurance
Department is practically on its trial as well as the
Equitable management (for there are admittedly things
Which the department should have found out and didn’t)
no doubt the present departmental investigation has been
carried through with special care. At December 31st last
the co. showed a surplus of £16,582,672. The depart-
ment cuts this down, as shown above, to £13,250,000. But
the lower figure has been arrived at by absolutely writing
off “ advances to agents,” amounting to nearly £1,250,000.
This seems to show that the overhaul has been pretty-
thorough, for, though it can’t be said for certain how
much of these advances are good, part of them no doubt
is a reasonably safe asset. Under the system adopted
by some of the American offices, districts are farmed out
to agents, who employ sub-agents, and these advances are
for the purpose of financing the principal agents, and are
made practically against future renewal premiums—
which, of course, may or may not come in, but most
likely will. That this whole item has been wiped
off the balance - sheet appears to show that
everything in the shape of doubtful assets has been
got rid of, so far as the department can see; and
there still remains £13,250,000 in excess of the amount
necessary to cover policy obligations. Thoug’b, in view
of the disclosures, American offices in Australia will have
such a hard row to hoe that they are likely to blunt their
tongues trying- to hoe it, the result of the investigations
will be balm to the troubled souls who already hold these
foreign policies and for the last few months have been in
doubt as to what they should do about them.
The policy of farming out certain business ex-
plains how it is that some favored officers of these
American insurance concerns have been able to make
such prodigious commissions. In one case—the worst so
far dug up, in connection with the Mutual Life of New
York the officer undertook to organise the foreig-n busi-
ness on a commission basis. Either he organised it so
well, or so much of it was waiting to be done without
anything special in the way of organisation, that thfe
business ran into millions, where only tens of thousands
were expected ; and the commission ran up to corres-
pond.

The Bulletin has received the following letter :
“ In your issue of the 11th May last commenting on the
Glissan v. Crowley case as the Full Court of this State
left it, you stated inter alia , ‘all the same the City
Mutual should have a disinfecting as rapidly as possible
and consult policy-holders as to future management.’
“ The obvious intention of the paragraph was, if I read
it rightly, to comment adversely on the principle of pay-
ing commision to directors on life assurance business
introduced by them (it is hardly necessary for me to say
that I do not agree with The'Bulletin’s views on this
matter), but it has been interpreted as a reflection by you
on the general administration of the affairs of this 'insti-
tution.
“ The affairs of a life assurance society are, and I think
wisely so, always open to the closest investigation and
scrutiny, but I cannot believe that The Bulletin deli-
berately intended to reflect on the administration of the
affairs of the City Mutual, and I would like your endorse-
ment of my belief.
“Yours faithfully,
r _ . “Geo. Crowley, Manager.”
[The Bulletin wished, on May 11, to make no reflec-
tions on the general administration of the affairs of the
City Mutual, the management of which has, at various
times, elicited its praise, for the good interest earnings,
the reduction of expense rate, and other items. The
adverse comment was confined to the point that commis-
sion should not be paid to directors on business intro-
duced by them. In that matter its opinion is unchanged,
and it hopes one day to find Mr. Crowley in agreement
with it.—Ed. Bulletin.]

The biggest business-end of the English trip of
general-manager Dibbs, of the Commercial Bank of Syd-
ney, failed, and he had to return without fixing’ up any-
thing definite with the Bank of Australasia in reg’ard to
exchange business. The banks used to make a pot of
money out of this when they had an ag-reement as to
rates ; then Dalgety’s and others cut in, and the Bank of
Australasia broke away in order to knock the “out-
siders ” out, and foreign exchange business is now hardly
worth bothering about.

This bank continues its remarkably prosperous career ;
but there is always at the back of the glittering figures
the possible skeletons of worked-out mines, deserted
mining towns, and depreciated or valueless securities.
Probably no bank in Australia calls for more prudent
management, and the figures don’t help one much to
judge in that matter ; ;for one can’t tell whether bad and
doubtful debts are being written down hard as the bank
goes along. The increased dividend leaves about 40 per
cent: of the profits to go to reserves to provide for the
probable slump ; and, though that is rather better than
the Australian average, it certainly isn’t too much in the
case of a bank which has all its eggs in one basket, the
bottom of which is liable to fall out. Certainly the
profits for the past half-year are charged with £3350 bonus
to officers, and as that isn’t a recurring expense the situa-
tion is a trifle better than the figures indicate. The
return shown by'profits does not suggest on the surface
any over-valuation of securities at present. On the basis
of capital (now £125,000) and reserves, the earnings have
recently moved in this way :
March, 1902 £lO 9 1 p.c. March, 1904 £ll 0 5p c

March, 1903 10 15 6 „ March, 1905 9 7 9
Sept., 1903 fl 14 0 „ Sept., 1905 94 9 ”
Among Australian banks only the Bank of Australasia
shows up better than this. But the Westralian conditions
are still abnormal, though they are becoming less so, as
these further comparisons show :

Premises .. 60,000 60,000
The very large proportion of deposits not bearing interest
has been a striking feature of the accounts; and the
bank didn’t allow all this money to lie idle—l 2 months
ago, in addition to the whole'of its capital, reserves,
tiTicl fixed deposits, the b&nk htid out in cidvances over
£250,000 of the public’s free money—a highly profitable
business. But during the year, whereas free deposits
have remained almost stationary, deposits on which in-
terest has now to be paid have" increased £326,766, and
advances have increased only £158,729, which means a
good deal less profitable business. As Westralian con-
ditions settle down, this movement may be expected to
proceed. The immediate result is a large increase in
specie and bullion (£1,114,764 as against £835,838), so that
the liquid assets now represent as much as 54 p.c. of total
liabilities to the public. But here again the figures can’t
be judged by ordinary standards ; for a bank which has
still so large "a proportion of current accounts couldn’t
maintain an ordinary 30 p.c. or so of liquid assets and be
safe.

The year’s distribution is represented as an 8 per cent,
div. on £IOO,OOO and a 4 per cent, bonus ; it is put that
way possibly to indicate that the directors are very doubt-
ful about the wisdom of it; and the doubt does them
credit. By next year it is to be hoped, all the same, the
doubt will disappear, and the directors will realise that
the co. has achieved its remarkable progress by the extra-
liberal additions it has made to reserves. There’s a vast
amount of Australian business yet to be won by Aus-
tralian co.’s, and almost the surest way to command it is
to give insurers the guarantee of a strapping reserve fund.
Even now, certainly, the year’s additions are handsome—
about 54 per cent, of profits—but the co.’s fine progress
during the last few years was partly the result of doing
much better than even that. As in the case with most
Australian offices, the unusually favorable experience of the
previous year in the matter of losses has not been repeated.

The balance is made up of small amounts written off
furniture, &c. The largest proportionate increase has
been in management charges and fire brigade and
similar contributions; and against that has to be
set the much better experience in the way of losses.
In 1900, though the expenses were but 337 p.c., only
14-8 per cent, of the premiums were profit ; in the past
year, with an expense rate up to 40’8 per cent., 14*2 per
cent, of premiums were profit; so that there is nothing-
much to complain of here. The assets include £70,000 in
public stocks (at cost), £55,000 on fixed deposit, and
£43,956 of real estate (book value); and the investments
have averaged £3 16s. 3d. per cent., which is reckoning in
as interest all income except from premiums, though it
certainly includes some fees. It still therefore looks as
though either not enough is charged to expenses for the
rent of such premises as are used for offices, or that some
of the assets could stand a little writing down.

This co. has the lumping habit badly ; and there are not
many concerns in which the habit is worse than it is in
connection with a trustee co. You can watch a bank or
a brewery, but tfie trustee only begins to work for you
when you are located where you can’t watch it—
not at any rate with the eye of the flesh. Therefore,
a trustee co. ought to take more pains than usual
to let the public know exactly what sort of a co. it is,
especially what the guarantees in the shape of assets are
really worth ; and that can’t be dohe until interest-
earnings are separated from commissibns. All that can
be said very definitely in this case is that the.paid capital
is £30,000; against that there is £IO,OOO in 3 per cent.
Government stock, £12,728 of mortgages, £3761 of
advances, and, in addition-to a few small items, £3355
bank deposit receipts “atcost, less amounts written off
and dividends received.” The last item should be written
down to its present value. Apparently most of the
writing-down done during the past few years, and shown,
has been in respect of advances against beneficiaries’ in-
terests, and they don’t now amount to much. The ex-
penses five years ago were 59 per cent, of gross income ;
they now amount to 56 per cent. In these five years the
profits have exceeded the divs. by £4623, which should
have added about £2OB a year to income ; and as the
income has increased by £915 (from £4147 to £5062), there
appears to have been a substantial increase in commis-
sions. On capital and reserves the profits show a return
of £7 4s. per cent. The £1 shares carry a liability of £4.

That is to say, after paying dividend tax (£3750) and
allowing for depreciation (£9021), besides spending
£12,589 in prospecting, the co.- has made a profit of
£189,214, on the capital of £1,200,000, or at the rate of
over 31 per cent, per annum. Of the reserves (and also
of the profits) £SOOO is, however, of a doubtful sort ;
it consists of the' nucleus of an insurance fund which the
co. has decided to establish in order to do its own insur-
ing. In ordinary circumstances, this (or some) amount
would have been paid to insurance co.’s and profits would
have been that much less ; as it is, there is a contingent
liability against it. The co., whose outlook was very
gloomy just after the amalgamation,, has made an extra-
ordinary recovery. The improved copper-market has, of
course, been a big factor. In the co.’s first half-year the
metal averaged £57 per ton ; in the past half-year, £67
9s. 3d. The copper output was 4253 tons ; so the rise has
been worth £44,600 to the co. in the half-year; and the
rise in silver has been worth nearly £7OOO. All expenses
have been paid by the silver (365,4400 z.), and the gold
(12,4250 z.), and a contribution of £23 per ton of copper ;
in other words, assuming the present output, costs, and
price of silver to continue, Mt. Lyell’could pay its way
with copper at £23 per ton. All over that (£44 9s. 9d.
per ton for the past half-year, to be exact) has been profit.
When Mt. Lyell Cos. was reformed in August,
1903, £140,000 of debentures were issued in place of North
Lyell’s previous London issue. Under the trust df-ed
these debentures have to be repurchased,; North Lyell
bad the same bond, but defaulted in its last half-year.
The amalgamated co. has, however, been mailing good
progress at clearing things out of the way. Like this :
Debentures Retired Special
Outstanding. During Term. Reserve.
Aug., 1903 ... £140,000 ...
March, 1904 .. 120,000 £20,000 £I,OOO
Sept., 1904 .. 97,750 22,250 1,556
March, 1905 .. 89,760 7,990 1,899
Sept., 1905 .. 78,420 11,340 1,553
The special reserve shown above, which is not included
in the reserv.es referred to in the table, is the result of re-
purchases at a discount. The current half-year should
see the debentures reduced to half their original size—in
two years and a half from the start. It isn’t many
mining co.’s that have the luck to do that. But, speak-
ing generally, the “ reserves ” of mining co.’s are a snare.
Mt. Lyell last half-year rooted out 213,809 tons of ore, and
since August, 1903, has treated 844,031 tons, and the mine
is the poorer by that much ; yet it still stands in the
accounts at £851,862, which was the original cost to this
present co. And it will no doubt stand at the same*
figure till the last payable ton of stuff is gouged out, and
the £851,862 is all moonshine. When that happens the
co. will require to nominally have £851,862 of reserves
before it really has any reserves at all.

From the £114,340 of profit there has been written off
plant, &c., £9659, leaving- £104,681 net. The accounts
don’t look like those of six months ago. A comparison
of liquid assets and liabilities at the two dates reads like
this:—
March. Sept.
Cash balances .. £571 .. £3,703
Products in hand, &e. .. 21,879 .. 40,373
Stores 5,482 .. 5,085
Sundry debtors .. 7,966 .. 70,809
Total liquid assets .. £35,898 .. £119,970
Less sundry creditors .. 22,683 .. 10,326
Surplus .. .. £13,215 £109,644
And meantime a £15,000 dividend has been paid. But
for most of it the sales of accumulated zinc “ tailings ”
and other by-products have been responsible. So far as
current work is concerned, comparatively little progress
has been made. Costs for ore-raising and milling have
been 15s. o"7d. per ton against 15s. the previous
half-year. But that is not a fair way of putting it. “ Ore
raising ” doesn’t include management, or development, or
“general mine work,” or “mine maintenance”; in fact,
apart from ore-raising and milling, the expenses, exclusive
of depreciation, run into 3s. 4d. per ton, with another sd.
per ton for outside expenses. This total of 18s. 4d. per
ton is a few pence worse than that of the South and other
cheaply worked mines ; but it is good. That it shows no
improvement on the previous half-year’s figures is due to
a larger expenditure on work outside mere ore-raising.
The mill-work shows an improvement on what the old
rattle-trap did in its last days ; but the expected improve-
ment upon the early work of the new mill isn’t discover-
able. While this new mill was running in the previous
half-year the recovery was 37 "29 per cent, of the silver
and 65T8 per cent, of the lead ; the recovery in the past
half-year was 36’96 per cent, of the silver and 65T2per
cent, of the lead—which are poor figures. Block 10,
which is getting its pre from deeper levels than any other
Broken Hill mine, has no doubt a tough proposition in
hand. But while this, in view of results, is some excuse
for the management, it isn’t anything in favor of the mine.
Block 10’s ordinary profits for the past half-year,
taking no account of depreciation, were at the rate of
£5 6s. 2d. per ton of the lead in the concentrates. Lead
averaged £l3 Bs. during the half-year; so if silver
remains steady, lead could fall to about £8 Is. lOd. before
the co. would be out of pocket, except for wear and tear
—on the basis, that is, of last half-year’s work, which
should be capable of a good deal of improvement.
Besides the residues which have been sold, the co. has put
520,000 tons of tailings under offer for £126,750 net. If
this deal comes off it will bring up the total surplus of
liquid assets over liabilities to £236,394, or £2 7s. per
share. But, even if the deal goes through, the last of the
money will not be available till 1911.

Broken Hill Block 14 figures for six months :
Profit from current operations £7,155
Bevenue from sales of accumulated zinc tailings 16,757
Total credit, working account .. .. £23,912
Less management expenses .. .. .. 1,491
Net profit £22,421
From this £619 is to be deducted for depreciation. A
very good result for a mine that had been worked to such
a standstill that six months ago the workings were full of
water. But as to what the mine can do in the future the
figures are positively no guide. To raise funds, it was
decided to root out the carbonates ; there is little of this
ore left in the mine, but by pursuing it with great energy
2860 tons were sent away ; and w'hile it only cost 14s. s|d.
per ton to root out, it realised more than 12,000
tons of the mine’s sulphides would have done. The
current half-year there may be a fair output of carbonate;
after that, only odd patches. With metals at present
prices co. would be foolish not to rush this ore out. The
lead (sulphide) mill was only in regular working order for
a week or two of the half-year ; but the zinc works were
going as regularly as an erratic supply of acid and a
plentiful supply of other troubles would allow 7 . And as
the carbonates can’t last, while the lead mill will do better
work, and the future of the zinc plant is doubtful, the
past half-year’s figures don’t give a line as to the future.
The underground developments in the mine have been
very satisfactory, however.
* •* * <
One of the difficulties that are liable to he
bumped against in connection with zinc-treatment has
been bumped against already by Block 14. During the
last three months the tailings were “ hardly suitable for
the acid method ” (the Zinc Corporation is going to use
the acid method), “being full of carbonate; and this
largely neutralised certain improvements effected in the
manner of working.”
* * * *
During this year market value of Broken Hill
mines has jumped from £3,750,000 to £5,810,000. The
improved lead and silver markets have been a factor ; the
investor, as distinguished from the gambler, will, how-
, ever, note that those markets are now 7 much above their
average. But the big deals in zinc material have made
most of the difference. Well, look at that matter with a
cold, unprejudiced eye. The Sulphide Corporation has
been making zinc concentrates for about three years. It
has paid ; but ordinary shareholders in the Sulphide Cor-
poration, who are very hungry for the divs. they haven’t
handled, know well enough that there hasn’t been a mint
of money in the business. Then the Australian Metal Cos.
has been a buyer of zinc tailings for about six years
past, and Block 10 has sold it tens of thousands of tons.
Yet some Block 10 shareholders have been acting as
though quite anew source of wealth had been opened up.
There wasn’t any boom w 7 hen both the Australian Metal
Cos. and the Sulphide Corp. proved that there was some
money in the “ tailings” ; it only arrived w'hen the Zinc
Corporation made some fairly big deals, and got options
for some much bigger ones. This Zinc Corporation
has, however, done absolutely nothing on an industrial
scale. The boom takes it for granted that it can’t fail.
But it can. Ten years ago the Sulphide Corporation
(Ashcroft’s Process), Limited., was going to do just as
great things. There wasn’t any trouble about getting off
a co. with a subscribed capital of £962,500. The thing was
so certain—the tests had been so conclusive—that £550,000
was paid for the patent rights. Then difficulties began
to crop up, and they went on cropping up, until the zinc-
production part of the business was absolutely dropped,
and £95,165 was written off the valueless zinc works. And
the Zinc Corporation doesn’t consist of shrewder men
than were behind the Sulphide Corporation. This assump-
tion that the Broken Hill zinc problem is settled, and
that there are millions in it (the market has jumped over
£2,000,000), is to a great extent premature. Certainly,
so far as some of the co.’s are concerned, they have made
their money—the Zinc Corporation has. taken the risk.
But the deals, actually completed, don’t by any means
run into millions. „ .

Estimate 300,000 tons in sight; also 100,000 tons probably
in addition. Average assays 22J p.c. lead, 12g p.c. zinc,
3Joz. silver. Ore can be concentrated easily ; extraction
of at least 70 p.c. of the lead, and 50 p.c. of the silver.
Cost of working, all included, 16s. per ton. Estimate

£l4 equal to 12s. ; with lead at £l2, 6s. Cos. can
also make a profit of ss. per ton by working
the zinc tailings, or can be sold at 3s. per
ton. Mine has great prospective value.” Shareholders in
the co.’s that have just sold their zinc tailings to Hoover’s
co. will be delighted to learn that they could have made
66 per cent, more by treating' the dumps themselves. No
opinion can be expressed about the estimate of ore
reserves ; Hertzig and Hoover had better means of esti-
mating than anybody else. But those of costs are
certainly low. The South, next door, with its vast ore
bodies, can’t work at less than 14s. 7|d. per ton for
mining and milling alone, and that isn’t counting in wear
and tear (very heavy in a concentrating mill), manage-
ment, and the cost of the new main shaft not charged to
working account. Block 10’s costs, “all included,” are
18s. lOd. plus depreciation. It is impossible to see how
the much-smaller South Blocks, which isn’t built for very
cheap working, can get down to 165., “ all included.” Re-
turning charges, estimated at £4 10s., have been
£1 higher than that, and are likely to be
higher again. On the other hand, the extraction
ought to g'o above 70 and 50 percent, respectively. Taking
8., M., and Co.’s averages, and that extraction, there is,
with lead at £l2 and silver at 2s. 6d., 425. worth of re-
coverable metal in the ore. Costs would be for mining
and milling 165., which is too little probably, and about
15s. returning charge (taking about six tons of ore to one
of concentrates); total 315.; leaving a margin of 11s.
The estimated profit of 6s. is therefore moderate—if the.
stuff will averag'e the 22J per cent, of lead stated. The
South ore only averages I'6£ per cent., though, and a
reduction of every unit in the South Blocks ore means
about Is. Bd. less profit per ton. If the estimate
crumples up, it will be mostly at these two points—costs
and lead value. But, taking Hertzig and Hoover’s figures
as they stand, there is £165,000 of profit in the mine with
lead at £l3; every £1 fall knocks off about £48,000 —
which is another risk in the gamble.

From a man whom The Bulletin has found
reliable :—“ C.S.A., Cobar (N.S.W.), already marked down
as one of the biggest mineral developments of the year,
hasn’t so far had too many remarks made as to the
quality or quantity of its ore bodies. VVriter, who followed
the early developments in the Broken Hill mines, is
satisfied, after inspecting the C.S. A., that, in the sulphide
zone, there is going to be almost a similar deposit, pro-
bably both as large and as rich as the Broken Hill
sulphides. So far as .development has gone in the oxidised
ore, results are good in value right through an eastern
crosscut at the 450 ft. level. For a distance of 90ft., the
crosscut shows a practically continuous silver-lead gossan
lode, with carbonate of lead and crystals ; also the face of
the crosscut (that is, 90ft. east from the shaft) is still in
good grade ore, and with no indications of nearing the
hanging wall. In the western crosscut, which is 30ft.
in, values are low ; but as the country here and there
carries splashes of carbonates, chances are that, though
it would appear to be approaching the footwall, more lode
matter may intervene before that is reached.
“On the surface the O.S.A’s. outcrop is
imposing, and is traceable through the property for a
distance of 1000 ft. As the strike of the lode is 10 degrees
west of north —and assuming that it lives for any distance
—Gardner’s blocks should catch it first; further on south,
the Central and South C.S.A. take in all the country w’ith
reasonable chances. That is, reasonable enough for the
outside public to take a risk on.
“On the north end, in O.S.A’s. own property,
mneral leases 10 and 14 look like a fine pup, struggling
V.. Number 10 is right on the strike of
w. ; <;.nw*~;lst thy~, vition, confined inside 40 acres, for
good business. °°r
“Flotation of Trewenack’s blocks north of
C.S.A. intoaco. of 2000 shares at £lO went easily, and
just doubled previous float of Central Blocks, which went
in 1000 shares of £lO. Trewenack, however, didn’t put
all his eggs in one basket, as another block (No. 80) and
Doyle’s, which are within six chains on the west and 20
chains on the north of the C.S.A., are held in reserve.
It is now stated that these blocks go together into a big
float on the Adelaide and Victorian markets ; and as
they certainly occupy the only area on the north which
at the moment would appear to have a good gambling
chance, Trewenack’s career as a floater is not over yet.
“Of the 230 acres occupied by the C.S.A.
proper, only 60 acres can be reckoned on line of lode ;
and as the combs of the country at the deepest workings
are almost vertical, probably with an eastern dip of one
foot in eight, writer can’t see anything but the one pup
north worth rearing. Of the western outcrop, which is
charted some 15 chains west of the main lode, little or
nothing can be said until some development has been
done. There always is the possibility of parallel bodies ;
if there are any values there, O.S.A. mineral lease 11 may
also do something as well as M.L’s. 4 (where the shaft is
and 10.
“Entering into the question of development, a
10,000 yd. dam on C.S.A. property gets early considera-
tion from the management. A million and a half-gallon
storage capacity, together with condensed water from
mine shaft, should tide the co. over the initial stage of
proving the mine. Meanwhile a north drive in the lead
ore at the present level has been decided upon, and a con-
tract entered with the Goldfields Diamond Drilling Cos. for
1000 ft. to 1500 ft. of boring, in holes 300 ft. each into the
sulphides.”
* * * *
Perseverance Gardner’s shaft, which is roughly
15 chains south from the C.S.A. shaft (Cobar, N.S.W.), is
now down 207 ft. in promising gossan; and prospects of
catching the C.S.A. lode are bright. The upper part
of the lode is leached, and there is no telling what
differences there may be in the level at which this stops.
An eastern crosscut might shed some light on the matter.
Meanwhile work is slow. Gardner’s blocks are ear-marked
for a strong Bull co.
* * * *
Queen Bee, Cobar (N.S.W.), as a result of the
visit of John Fox (late manager of Cobar Gold Mines) to
the Cold Country, is likely to see changes. Understood
that Fox offers £50,000 cash, and 50,000 shares in a co.
not to exceed £250,000. Fox, of course, requires inspec-
tion of the mine, and, if satisfied, is prepared to pay
£2OOO cash for a three months’ working option.
* * * *
Two promising shows of silver-lead gossan ores,
one at Budgery, Hermidale, and the other on Restdown,
Boppy Mountain (N.S.W.), have been lately discovered.
Budgery is said to look particularly promising, carrying
gold, silver, and lead, and, being on the railway line
between Nyngan and Cobar, will just now command
attention.
* * * *
It had almost been forgotten that H. B. Coles took
Mt. Drysuale (N.S.W.) to London to float, but a cable from
Coles says that Bull is sending an expert to look into the
Drysdale rich pockets, and if he’s satisfied they’re there,
or that the mine has still places where they probably will
be later on, London will become interested.

“A report from the manager of Coppabella
Block No. 1 (N.S.W.) states that a solid body has been
driven through 21ft. without the wall being found. Rich
galena ore has also been struck. At the Boulder at 115 ft.
in the tunnel, the lode has been struck; it is mineralised
and vertical.” All of which is so beautifully vague as to
be worth nothing. That solid 21ft. body—what is it
made of ? Has it been sampled ? What does it assay ?
Is it “ mineralised and vertical,” like the Boulder, with
the tunnel driven through buck quartz ? And how much
verticalness will it take to make a dividend?
* * * *
At Neild’s, Wyalong (N.S.W.), the second
biggest concern on the field, an old trouble has revived.
The other day miners employed were asked to work till
12 o clock on Saturday night instead of 11.30, as hitherto :
men again refused to yield up a time-honored custom,
and the owners knocked off one of the shifts. This
naturally hasn t improved matters, and relations are very
strained. The Golden Fleece Cos. is opening out on two
iair-si z ed reefs at the 800 ft., and has excellent prospects
ahead. A parcel of 40 tons yielded 91 oz. gold. True
Blue is making good progress with the erection of
machinery for condensers and rock drills.
* * • •
Associated, Kalgoorlie (W.A.), is in the midst
of many improvements. The surface equipment is being
renovated beyond recognition, and is expected to be com-
pleted by end of year. A clear run is anticipated in
January, or at latest in February, when 10,000 to 11,000
tons will be treated monthly. After that the mine will
rank as one of the biggest producers and div.-payers of
the Golden Mile. The incline winze on the Oroya shoot
at the 1000 ft. level is down 300 ft. and has still 100 ft. to go
to connect with the incline rise from the 1200 ft. This
work will be completed by end of November, and will
ventilate the workings at 1000 ft. Reason so little has
been heard of the Oroya shoot lately is that the
air is so bad that no prospecting is being done.
This winze will alter that. Some very rich telluride is
being broken from the Oroya East lode in the winze below
the 1000 ft. level. A truck-load from there contained
nothing but “ specimens.” The lode on the west boun-
dary, the best part of which was found to be in Persever-
ance ground, is being followed on its strike south-east,
and the continuation of the telluride shoot may yet be
found in Associated ground. At 1400 ft. the Australia
East lode isr being stoped out in a block 20ft. wide by 280 ft.
long, worth 18dwt. ; this is the best stope in the mine. An
enormous quantity of 8 to lodwt. ore is left in the top
levels, and can be broken out at a nominal cost. It is
safe to say the Associated is looking better than at any
previous time in its history, and will give a good account
of itself next year.
« * * *
Associated Northern, Kalgoorlie, supposed to
be absolutely done months ago, is now estimated to have
89,400 tons of 22'37dwt. ore in sight. This estimate is
made by manager G. M. Roberts, who takes no chances.
Cos., for months past, has been earning a profit of £II,OOO
monthly, and will continue doing so for at least two
years.
* * * *
Northern Blocks Syndicate (W.A.) is prac-
tically ready to start crushing on its new property, the
Great Leviathan, Southern Cross. Trouble is that the
late Government refused to supply water from the gold-
fields scheme unless co. paid £IBOO for the pipe line, guar-
anteed to consume a minimum quantity of water, arid
agreed to pay ss. per lOOOgal. Cos. offered to lay the line
itself at a cost not exceeding £I2OO, and to take as much
water as it required, some 30,000 to 40,000ga1. a month,
but objected to pay 50 per cent, more for the main than
it was worth, or to guarantee to pay for more water
than was used. But for this dispute some 100 men
would have been employed. The difficulty will, how-
ever, be settled now, and the mill will probably start
in December. The reef has been opened up at 60ft.
and 130 ft., and is stronger though poorer at the latter
level. A test crushing showed 16dwt., and the 10-head
mill is expected to treat 1500 tons of this grade monthly.
There is enough stone in sight to recoup the co. the
£12,000 to £15,000 expended on purchase, equipment,
&c. A main vertical shaft is being sunk, and will be con-
nected with the present 130 ft. level, which will be the
real first level of the mine. No more development will
be done till a connection is made, and the mill starts.
* * • #
Hainault, Kalgoorlie, is opening up remarkably.
Ore reserves are now estimated at 205,000 tons, worth
9dwt. This is above the 750 ft. level, on which very
little work has been done so far. At present rate of con-
sumption this means four years’ supply. Already mill
has treated 100,000 tons ; and this surely justifies an exr
tension of plant. It was mooted by directors some
time ago. Manager Moss vetoed the proposal for the
time being, but may change his mind now.
» * * •
Perseverance, Kalgoorlie, is crosscutting at
1100 ft. for the new lode recently found in its ground by
the Associated. This lode is at least 20ft. wide, and
worth 2oz. to the ton where penetrated. How much
wider it is is not known, as the Associated stopped work
when it found it was trespassing. The crosscut should
reach the lode easily this month, and may make a big
difference to the mine’s prospects.
• * * *
Golden Pole, Davyhurst (W.A.), is very sick.
As long ago pointed out, all mines in the district, such
as De Baun’s Mulwarrie and Speakman’s Mt. Callion,
petered out at about 300 ft., and Pole is doing the same.
For the past three months there has been great difficulty
in keeping the mill going, and “cleaning of boilers,”
“ breakdowns of machinery ” and other excuses have
hinted at the truth. The fact is there is not enough
stone to keep the mill going. Nat Harper, the ex-
manager, has had a lot of hard luck. He has in succession
steered Frasers (Southern Cross), Robinson’s and White
Feather Main Reefs (Ilanowna), and Golden Pole (Davy-
hurst). All made a splash ; all came to grief. By the way,
Richard Hamilton, of Great Boulder, during the first week
in October inspected the mine, and, though he didn’t
boom it as much as some bulls tried to make out, yet he
certainly gave shares a fillip, and went into figures that
now won’t stand inspection.
• * * •
Queensland Menzies (W.A.), after many warn-
ings, has at last closed down. Every effort was made to
locate new pay shoots, but fruitlessly. Cos. has taken
over the Good enough, at one time under option to
Boulder Hamilton. Goodenough has produced 750 oz.
from 3,900 tons, but, like all Menzies mines, is erratic.
Still, as Manager Fergusson has thought it worth a trial,
there must be something in it, as he knows the district
well.
* * * *
Lancefield (W. A.) has discharged most of its
men, as management is in a quandary over the treatment
of its tailings. Ore reserves were valued at 345, but
September’s return only panned out at 17s. 4d., and
showed a loss of £I6OO. This mine was run by the origi-
nal prospectors under Strauss, and paid monthly divs. of
£360. At that time two-thirds of the gold came from the
residues, as it does still, and yet 8., M. and Cos. are under-
stood to say the residues are incapable of treatment.
The real fact seems to be that the mine was over-valued.
• • • *
Mack’s Creek, Kenington, and Ten Mile com-
prise a little nest of villages up Jamieson way (Vic.),
which blossomed out as a mining district over the Star of
the West boomlet. There was the original show of that
name, then the Extended, Champion Blue Ribbon, Rule
Britannia, and three or four other claims which fit as
nicely as can be into a descending scale of merit. While
it can be said of the Star of the West that it was
a lucky hit, as shareholders only had to put up
Is. 5Jd. to get on to the div. list, none of the “ pups ”
are dogs of the same breed. Thus while parent co. paid
7s. in divs. during the half-year, other claims were on or
about the call-list. Champion boasted of a big forma-
tion, with gold here, there, and everywhere. Yet, now
the battery is at work, shares don’t jig as they would if
the div. era was in sight. Still there may be a
surprise in store for the waiting crowd to galva-
nise both bulls and bears. Fate of the field hangs
largely on the Star of the West. There good stone
worked in No. 1 and 2 tunnels seems to have pinched out,
and operations lower down seem to be a very “blue”
spec. The Extended always was, and is, a gamble.

The Victorian Coal Mines Inquiry Commission,
investigating the conditions of labor arid the profits, etc.,
of the Gippsland mines, is getting what it was understood
to be appointed for—surprising information. So far as
directors and managers have been examined they seem to
be full of a vast mass of want of knowledge. “ You had
better ask the manager as to that,” or “ Perhaps the
directors could inform you,” or “That is a question for
the engineer to answer ” were the usual replies. Still the
Commission managed to drag out of Manager Nicholson,
of the Outtrim-Howitt Cos., the admission that before the
'O3 lock-out 700 men were employed as against 270 at pre-
sent, and that while, during the seven years prior to ’O3,
dividends were paid averaging 34 per cent, per annum, no
dividends have been paid since. Yet the public was
assured during the trouble that the miners were making •
such high wages that the companies could not carry on ;
also, when the difficulty was temporarily got over by the
aid of blacklegs, the same simple public was assured
that the companies would get along nicely without the
“ strikers,” and that “ plenty of good miners were offer-
ing.” On the other side, competent miners swore that
the conditions of getting out coal were so obsolete and
unsatisfactory that they could not make a living thereat;
the frequent handling of the coal reduced so much to
“ slack ” that they received payment for only half what
they won. One miner characterised the system at
Outtrim as the “ finest scheme of roguery he had seen
carried on.”

One of the works to earn divs. for John Bull,
erected by the Victorian Al, Gaffney’s Creek (Vic.), was a
flagstaff. Flag was hoisted lately, but, owing to halliards
getting tangled, would not half-mast, where it
stuck. It knew—it wanted to go in mourning for Bull’s
capital.

Great Northern Extended Consols, Rutherglen
(Vic.), after a long struggle with water and the trouble
caused by the burst which took place a few years ago, has
pretty well got from under the cloud, and should soon be
on the div. list. But Wilkinson, the manager, who has
brought the mine through its troubles, is not to get the
kudos of paying the first dividend ; D. H. Browne, of
Charlotte Plains and Spring Hill and Central Leads, and
his son, have succeeded Wilkinson as manager and assis-
tant manager respectively. In the face of a 3d. call,
shareholders are asking whether it’s more economical to
have two managers than one.

Brisbane Stock Exchange, which, in a dull call,
doesn’t get beyond recording- the sale of 100 Lady Jane
Extenders at Is. ljd., grew angry last week because it
received no news concerning the cutting of the lode at
the O.K. While the Exchange was interrogating John
Newell, chairman of directors, and Newell was replying
that he had no knowledge on the subject, shares moved up
from 13s. 6d. to 17s. 6d. That 4s. rise broke Brisbane’s heart.
Later on another director, usually pretty handy to the
mine, wired still another director, who was in Sydney,
that the lode had been cut and assayed 18 per cent,
copper. The incident has made Brisbane Exchange people
more decided than ever that Brisbane is the proper place
for the co.’s office. In fact, much of the fuss is being
made with a single eye to that change.

Willcocks’ Cloncurry syndicate has not yet quite
decided to erect smelters on the field, although the press
of N.Q. is sure upon the point. A “ competent man
Alan Gibb, no doubt—is first to report upon the pro-
posal. A wise step. Although it is popularly supposed,
in view ' of the Richmond railway extension (Clon-
curry-wards), that smelting on the field is bound
to be a success, such an issue is by no
means certain. After completion of the railway exten-
sion, many of the good copper deposits will still be over
100 miles from the railway line, and 100 miles cannot be
traversed by coke teams before breakfast. Cloncurry is a
big, scattered field. 0.K., with only half that distance to
traverse, is practically beaten by the transport difficulty,
and nothing but a railway will extricate it from the worst
of the mess.

Ravenswood (N.Q.) blew the froth off a lot of
shandy at the end of last week when the Deeps struck an
18-inch vein going 3oz. gold to the ton. Considering the
importance of the strike to the many anxious investors,
not only in the Ravenswood Deep mines, but in other
properties, there was probably some justification for the
display of bunting and the drunk. To sink 1520 ft.
and get nothing, after expecting to tap the Sunset
reef at less than 1300 ft., did not deter Laurence Wilson ;
and as soon as John Bull had lent the show some money
he put out a crosscut over 300 ft., and now everything is
happiness and sore heads. It will be bad luck if the vein,
when opened on, proves a rotter, as was the case with
each of the lodes passed through in the main shaft.
Laurence Wilson, not to mention anyone else, deserves
better than that—he is such a plucky gambler. With a
drop of luck in the Deeps and his tube mills both working,
this “boss of Ravenswood” will make his field popular
again.

It takes a battler to stick to a way-back district
like Cloncurry (N.Q.). The men who have been raising
copper-ore there lately have had poor hopes of getting the
stuff to market till perhaps March. There is now a 50-
mile dry stage on the road, and cartage is practically
stopped ; they are talking of camels. A load of ore, got
ready at Hampden in July, is still on the track ; and, as
it has the dry stage ahead of it, it will be some months
yet before it is delivered. On crude ore going 35 per cent,
copper, freight to market has been running away with
£l6 per ton of metal, and still more, of course, for lower-
grade ore. On top of that, some miners have had to pack
water as much as 15 miles to their camps.

Bennion’s No. 2 shaft, on which Croydon (N.Q.)
is keeping its eye glued, is proving a disappointment. It
was put down with the idea of dodging the water that
flooded out No. 1 shaft; and though it has dodged the
heaviest flow of water, it seems also to have dodged the
reef, and either got into the intrusive bar or has the bar
between it and the No. 1 shaft. The plan originally
recommended, of fighting the water in No. 1, is now being
adopted.

“ M.C.” : Proposed to start pig-iron smelting at
Aldershot (Q.), where coal can be had at a low price. It
is said that ore averaging over 60 per cent, of iron, and
suited to the cheap acid process of furnace treatment, is
also available ; such ore would be immensely more econo-
mical to handle than comparatively poor ore, say 50 per
cent., containing phosphorus and sulphur, requiring the
more costly basic treatment. Iron smelting has been so
elaborated and specialised of late years that it should be-
come a special study for Australian students, and
encouragement and facilities to learn the nature of our
iron ore deposits should be given by State Governments.
Writer could name half-a-dozen deposits of iron ore near
railways in various States, but could not say which was
the richest ore and which could be the most cheaply
mined and smelted, simply because such knowledge
requires an elaborate study of the details of the business ;
and where are the means for the study ?

Distant peaks look golden. So with Lake
Jukes (Tas.), away beyond Mt. Owen, where the pros-
pector has been hunting for a second Mt. Lyell, and only
finding a copper-stained rock as green as the turf at its
base. Thither, in the wake of the prospector, went some
of the old North Lyell crowd, and thither seems to have
followed some of the old North Lyell luck. Bull cash has
helped the show on, and Bull optimism looks like having
its usual fate; A circular, stated to have been published
by the London Board, tells of “ a rich shoot,” of many
experiments made to find out the simple matter whether
ore is refractory or not, and of assays continuously giving
high values both in copper and gold. And it also stated
that, “ at the outset,” it was proposed to treat payable
gold-bearing ore only. How the shade of James Crotty
must have gasped when it read this 1 Why should
anything but p- yable ore be treated at any
time? Anyway, the battery return reported in
October was 130 tons for 90z., the official report
notifying that the ore was average-grade rock carrying
copper as bornite. Such a God-forsaken region as Mt.
Jukes demands something more tangible than under
2dwt. dirt to keep it alive as a mining region. If there is
payable dirt, why wasn’t it heaved under the stamps ?
Concentration to recover lost gold and copper is stated
not to have been commenced. No wonder ; and if the
copper contents are not of higher worth than the gold,
its best place is in the dump, to be forgotten.

On the basis of market valuation of £1,800,000
Mount Lyell mine does not wash out so satisfactorily as
the balance-sheet. Give the co. credit for realisable
assets worth £600,000. That is 10s. a share. What is
there beyond this? To find out, the North Lyell ore
reserves have to be examined. The pressure for ore is
shown by the withdrawals from the 600 ft. and 700 ft.
levels. Nos. 1 and 2 levels are exhausted, No. 3 (which
was one of the main sources of supply during the
half-year) is almost exhausted, while above No. 4 the
main stopes are almost up to the No. 3 level. Therefore it
rests with the 500, 600, and the newly opened-up 700 ft.
levels to furnish the ore forthe future ; and it is admitted
that the 500 was not a “bonser." Sticht’s estimate,
made in March, 1904, was 185,000 tons to 500 ft. Look at
the work he has done since in the North Lyell mine
Ore broken.
Tons.
Sept., 1904.. 53,530
Mar., 1905 63,104

The rapidity with which stoping was begun at the 600 ft.
level in the March half-year, and at the 700 ft. during last
term, gives point to the story told by the above figures.
Therefore, while Sticht has certainly got ore well below
700 ft., the extent proved, so far, has only very partially
compensated for the inroads made on reserves during the
past three terms. So the splendid balance-sheet has to
be looked at very critically until it can be shown that
the shortage of the supplies in the North Lyell mine has
been overcome. No share movement ought to be allowed
to hide the fact.

When a mine gets out of debt, when it is well
managed and dividends are ahead, it is usual to look for
a market rise. Briseis (Tas.) provides all these essentials,
but the shares don’t gee. Why is it ? The property lias
profits assured, tin is about £SO higher than it was ever
expected to go, and developments at the mine up the
lead are giving an increased area of drift. The first cause
of the refusal of stock to budge is that those who were
ever likely to buy into the co. did so long since, many
at the boom price. These don’t want to hold
but to get, for they cannot quite brush from their
memory Currie’s estimate, nor do they forget the
story told by the Cascade flood. Then there Is a big
bundle of speculators who hold piles of shares for the
market rise which is so slow in coming; and, then, the
public is very shy about nursing a baby in a 600,000 share
co. The addition of a prominent speculative broker to
the London directorate not only didn’t help to make the
stock popular, but it led to a good few realisations.
Slowness of the co. in getting up to the 100 tons-a-month
output is another cause, and there is still doubt about the
get-away for the tailings. And behind it all is the feeling
that the mine won’t pay more than £1 per share in divs.
on 600,000 shares. None the less, the portent is that the
payment of the first div. will be the occasion for a bull
move in the market: but whether the public will respond
is quite another matter.
A 12 inch Suction Dredging Plant is being built
for the Weldbrook Tin Mines (Jo. The plant will be
similar in design to those erected at the Pioneer and
Briseis Extended Tin Mines (Tasmania). The engines will
be of the vertical compound condensing type of about
300h.p. fitted with an Edwards type of air pump and
large surface condenser. The boilers will be two in
number, of the marine type, and will work at a pressure
of 1501 b. to the square inch. The nozzle pump will be
centrifugal and directly connected to a vertical compound
steam engine. The barge will be 45ft. square. The
Austral Otis Engineering Co., of South Melbourne, which
is constructing this dredge, has been particularly success-
ful in building these large type of suction dredges and
owing to their reputation have just concluded a contract
for the erection of a plant in the Federated Malay States
which promises to be the fore-runner of many more of the
like.*

It is of great importance to those interested in
mining to understar,d that the judgment in the recent
action of the Wilfley Co., does not deprive the industry
of the latest important development in concentrators.
The Card concentrates on an entirely opposite principle
to the Wilfley. In the latter the dressing takes place on
the smooth surface at the ends of the diagonal riffles
which is claimed by Wilfley as the essence of his invention.
Whilst in the Card the dressing takes place in the
continuous channels and not oh the surface of the table,
hence much greater capacity, higher concentrates and
poorer tailings. The injunction applies merely to two

Janor : As so many aboriginaliars have
been snake-bitten, I would like to say (just to take
on that lonely feeling that one has who has not
been bitten) that I was once nearly bitten by half
a snake. Was splitting out mining laths in white
box country. They were big trees, mostly hollow
that is, the hearts had been destroyed by ter-
mites and replaced by earth. Consequently they
were bad sawing, and it was quite a usual occur-
rence tor the saw to jam when half way through a
m ysaw “ fitchered ” so one evening,
grabbed the axe, chopped saw out, and knocked
ott. .Next morning, saw the middle portion of a
torge black snake showing through the aperture.
He was lying between the wood and the core of
earth. A nick with the axe divided the reptile,
one half disappeared smartly. T’other half’
which I diagnosed as his latter end, remained
stationary, and as it was in the way of the cross-
cut I seized it and pulled. Then he came so sud-
denly that I almost overbalanced. Also I dis-
covered that I had hold of the better half, and as
struck for me I let go and spoilt his aim with a
lett hook. He missed my arm, and fastened on to
the rolled-up shirt sleeve. Grasping the half-
calamity behind the ears I slung him to Gehenna.
It was the quickest round of a life time.
“ Dave H.R.” : It is a prominent feature
of closer settlement that the breed of sheep is fast
improving. This year, whilst engaged in coaxing
our great natural resources marketwards, I have
had personal proof of the fact; and have also
heard it much mentioned by wool-classers and the
mdividual who washes the object pursued by
Jason. Said one of the latter: “The cocky is
beginning to realise that it pays him much better
to have 800 or 900 or 1000 well-bred sheep, with
heavy, strong fleeces, than 2000 straggly animals
that rarely cut 61b. apiece. Also with small pad-
docks, and consequently less roaming about on
the part of the animal through burrs and
herbage, the wool is freer from seed and other
foreign substances than station fleece.” A wool-
classer told me that with closer settlement on a
large scale, and the consequent small paddocks,
the breed of sheep must inevitably improve, and
he considers that ten years of closer settlement
would double the value of Australia’s annual
wool-clip. Also, as the railway throws out its
tentacles the fat stock business increases. Indeed,
not long since there was quite a glut in the mar-
ket-many cookies being this year within reach of
the fast and cheap circumstance who were last
year beyond its pale. Notably is this the case in
the matter of the extension of the Narrabri-Wal-
gett railway to Oryon. By this extension much
wool has helped to benefit the Railway Depart-
ment, which would otherwise have fallen to the
share of steamer-owners. There is nothing like a
railway to induce closer settlement, if the land
laws allow people to settle; and nothing like
closer settlement to send a country forward —with
a decent tariff to provide a manufacturing popula-
tion as a market.
“H.S.R.”: After all the talk of the
kookaburra, no one has mentioned this peculiarity.
He will die of starvation in the midst of plenty,
for unlike the magpie, crow, butcher-bird, and
others, he will not feed off carcases of sheep or
cattle. Still, if you cut pieces off and throw them
about he will swoop down and pick them up.
Perhaps in drought time he is merely saying
“Mutton, mutton everywhere, and not a bit to
eat” when he is supposed to be laughing.
Another thing I have not seen mentioned is that
the kangaroo rat destroys thousands of young
thistles, and that since he has been almost exter-
minated they have increased. The kangaroo rat
does little harm to the sheep-farmers that I
can see, but he does no good to the agricul-
turist, as he is addicted to bandieooting spuds
and other fruit, and is a good hand at driving
under fences, and probably in this way makes
roads for the festive dingo and rabbit.

Now, I’ve had a fair experi-

tion, I fail to see why there

neat), and, to use his own
expression, “pokes over to

or that he is even thirsty,
but it’s the one oasis in a
desert of sombre monotony

was not a toothful of greenstuff on the tree, but

A wail from Gippsland :
A few days to November, and bhroug'h the cracks in the
roof on to my rough table comes a steady “drip-drip.”
Up the road wander the sulky-looking cows, horning each
other as they go, the calves following dejectedly. In the
paddock opposite two mares and a colt turn hanging wet
tails to the icy blast as they root for tufts of grass, biting
and kicking on the smallest provocation. A couple of
swallows roost disconsolately on a rafter, and round my
door the hungry magpies gather. The creek is running
fast and chocolate-colored ; a little while and the muddy
snow-waters will pour from hill and gully, and it will be
a banker. The wind shrieks and every now and then I
hear a dull “ clunk ” as the heavy snow drops from the
roof. Round the blazing logs the men gather gloomy,
unsociable and unwashed. “ Won’t be a damned lamb
left alive,” they say. “ Shearin’ ?—there’ll be no damned
shearin’ if this goes on. Been on this place man an’ boy
this 30 year an’ never seen such a winter.” Along the
road comes a horseman galloping. We hope he has the
mail. Instead he tells us, “Poor Tom chucked a sixer
last night—‘pumonia’—an’ the police is out lookin’ for
the coach. Think it’s washed away. Lines down every-
where.” Through close on a foot of snow I make
my way to the nearest paddocks to have a look
at the sheep. Not a “woolly” in sight, but as I
go, I stumble across the new-born lambs. Around their
little bodies the snow has melted a bit, making dark
patches in the whiteness. Most of them are eyeless—the
crows, at any rate, have broken their fast. Up a hill-side
I climb that, two days since, was gay with creamy
clematis and purple sarsaparilla, and on across the sheeted
home paddock, where the dandelions and earl} 7 buttercups
and violets had said so plainly “ Spring has come.” A
few red-breasts dart to and fro, making bright patches of
color ; but where are the parrots, wood-pigeons, black
magpies and sparrow-hawks that, a week since, built so
busily? The glare has almost blinded me, and brought
on something extra-special in headaches, so I make my
way back to the hut to await the thaw, just in time to
hear the cheerful idiot remark, “Fine weather for ducks.”

Dr. T. F. Macdonald, of Geraldton (Q.)
Bureau of Tropical Diseases, concerning a White
Australia :
The geographical distribution of dark-skinned people
showed that the origin of color was not due to the tropics.
The blackest color was usually possessed by the most
primitive people ; and, by the action of time, color had,
in certain nations, slowly dissolved. Experience had
shown that white people could rapidly adapt themselves
to change of climate. He had seen white gangs working in
sugar fields, and they were healthier than colored gangs
engaged in similar conditions. The question arose : “ Can
the sugar industry profitably employ white men, at white
men’s wages?” His answer was in the affirmative. If
the Australian people were determined that the industry
should be carried on by Europeans, it was only a question
of what price sugar should be in the market. Would our
people be prepared to pay a little more for their sugar?
borne form of Protection to sugar would, however, be
necessary, as it would be absurd to expel the Kanaka
from Queensland and at the same time allow sugar to
come into Australia which had been grown under similar
circumstances to those objected to. Eastern people, if
they came here, would lower the standard of wages,
would interfere with national principles and the develop-
ment of Australian democracy, and therefore Australia
should remain white.

“ L. Dick ” : Some years ago was camped
on the Herbert River (West Queensland), and
came across a big nigger carrying a billy. I sang
out, “Hello, Buckley ! What you bin ketchum?”
He lifted the lid and disclosed a nice brown snake
mixed up with a fine goanna, a brace of rats, a
bird, a lizard, a frog, and beneath all these luxuries
a lot of big white grubs dug out of trees. Saw
same nigger, some hours later, fast asleep under a
tree, looking enlarged and very happy.
“Krex ” : Re
the fighting quali-
ties of the horse.
When the Hun-
gerfords owned
Cadelgo Station
(S.A.), on the
border of Queens-
land, they had a
steed whose kick-
ing propensities a
mule might envy.
W hen yarding
cattle Sandy was
kept heavily shod
behind, and if a
buck (i.e. a two-
year old or more,
un branded bull)
broke from the
mob, he would be
followed by the
man on Sandy and
forced back. But
sometimes the buck
wheeled suddenly
to argue the point.
Then Alexander, the
horse, would wheel
j ust as suddenly,
reach out viciously
with both hind feet,
and plant them on
the buck’s counten-
ance, or send his horns
whizzing sky-
wards. If the
animal was
not quite
convinced
that he was
wrong, one or
two more kicks
either ended his
career or sent him
back towards the yard,
shaking his head and
looking as if he had a
fixed intention of telling
his raa, or some other near
relation. Sandy was never
known to fail, and around
Cudelgo Station there were many
skulls which bore the imprint of
his shod extremities.
“David Richards”: Be the proposal of
the Cocky Carruthers Government to protect the
native cat or the domestic feline “which has be
come wild,” with the idea that it is on the road
to the solution of the N.S.W. rabbit problem—it
is a hass. I have known this method tried by
settlers. The feline will eat a few young rabbits,
but only a very few. After a short while they
fraternise and intermarry. There is far too much
food in the line of young birds, mice and rats, &c.,
in the bush, and will be for years «">« to ,
allow of any prospect of cats
bit. What is wanted is— popidatit>iC %.*-liy'hs *»-■'
that we hear very little of the ravages of bunny
amongst the small forty-acre men of Victoria ?
The country there is just as favorable to the culti-
vation of rabbit as any part of N.S W. And why do
we never hear complaints of bunny from England,
where there are no phosphorus carts, and no
wire-net* ing regulations ? The proposal of Car-
ruthers to make friends with the cat is ridiculous
in the extreme. There is only one way of coping
with the rabbit, and Australia wants to get up
and roar out till it is done—a graduated land-
tax that will burst up the big estates; good
legislation that will encourage close settlement (not
Peter Close settlement) ; and a decent tariff that
will cause a tide of desirable immigrants to make
a big bound for these shores, till the country has
so many people that they will eat the rabbit, or
put him m a can and sell him for good yellow
money to someone else who hasn’t the luck to
have any rabbit, and with the money build a gun
to shoot the person if ever he comes here to take
the rabbit without paying for him,
* * * *
“Hexham” : “ A.D.” (B. 2/11/’O5) asks why
young fruit-trees in the bush are free from pests.
All pests travel —insects with wings, fungi through
spores carried about by the wind —and the bush
intercepts these before they can reach the fruit-
tree. The phylloxera vine disease spread through-
out the south of Erance in two or three years, the
vineyards being nearly contiguous and having no
great forests to protect them. In the county of
Cumberland, where there is so much hush, though
the disease was discovered at Liverpool a dozen
years ago, it took four or five years to get to Canley
Vale but three miles off, and only last year
appeared at Smithfield another three miles further
on. Re various pars on “old man,” or southern
wood, as a remedy for peach aphis. May as
well read the burial service over them. Peach
aphides can only be got rid of hy poison,
and it must be a poison that kills when it touches
them, such as nicotine, kerosene, etc. Have tried
horrihle-smelling mixtures suchastheChowsusefor
cabbage pests, and found them utterly worthless
for peach aphis, which, unlike cabbage aphis, is a
permanent resident on the tree, and can be found
there during the hardest frosts if searched for
carefully. Local orchardists generally spray with
infusion of tobacco-stalks, but this only kills the
live insect. The eggs hatch out the first fine day,
and the spraying has to be continually repeated.
The aphis-eating ladybird is a fraud. It does not
show up till the end of September, when the
aphis has been at work three months, and then it
would need ten times the average crop of lady,
birds to do any real good.

The “Over-Seas” issue of London Daily
Mail allows a correspondent to explain that
shearing rates in Queensland are “20s. for every

by cablegram.
THE WOOLLY SHEEP.
[ FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My gentle friend, dear, golden-headed Tot,
Walks out one wet, warm morning in the Spring
To show me this, her last, her new delight;
And I—l am prepared for anything.
The big, bright eyes are proud. It is the pride
Of sweet possession ; all her face is full.
I see before me in his long, soft clothes
A woolly sheep, delightful in his wool.
He skates around sedately through the room,
And loud his praise the babbling cherub sings ;
My eyes go wandering out the open door ;
I think of woolly sheep and many things.
I see our thirsty, sunburnt continent ;
The wilderness where sluggish rivers creep,
They bear away thy burdens to the sea ;
The land is all for thee, O woolly sheep !
For thee we grapple with the undergrowth ;
For thee we spoil the glory of the trees.
All bloom must perish on thy heritage—
Begone, O singing birds and humming bees !
We store the trickling waters for thy sake ;
We tap the bubbling rivers swift and deep,
A thousand feet below all bright and cool— ■
’Tis all because of thee, O woolly sheep !
Thy paths are in the far back-stretching scrub
Where rain scarce falls and grasses never grow;
Strange shrubs and trees will give thee sustenance ;
Out, and still out, thy farthest heralds go.
We strip thee of thy treasures everywhere ;
By dead dry plains and by the river side.
The grim black ranges and the grave, grey heath—
These, too, are thine—our land is warm and wide.
But one sad thought is with us—we who toil,
And moil, and suffer, nor one prize can keep—
They make us clothes from rags across the sea ;
Thy wool is not for us, O woolly sheep I
Our flocks are out upon a thousand hills ;
Our statesmen screech and all our trumpets blow,
And greedily the big ships take from us
The best and brightest wool the world can grow.
For all the millions in the smoke and mist
The white flesh must be beautiful and cheap—
As soft as flowers in spring-time tenderness—
Gold are thy little lambs, O woolly sheep 1

“J.D.”: Recently, near Almaden, North
Queensland, I hired a darkie and his gin to find a
sugar-bag, and they proceeded as follows : The
nigger stripped to the waist-belt; the gin, by a
sudden and adroit movement —as A. Ward would
say—transposed her skirt into a pair of running
pants. Then they proceeded to a waterhole,
having first selected several pieces of down with
points from the dilly-bag. A great number of
bees were around the water, and one was easily
caught by the simple process of squirting a mouth-
ful of water over him. The pointed down was
quickly attached, and the surplus water blown
from the unfortunate insect. Then he was tossed
in the air and the chase began. The nigger ran
with his eyes fixed on the bee, whilst the gin
watched her boy’s footsteps. The reason for these
proceedings was apparent, for when the next
stride would have carried the buck into a small
tree-trunk, the gin gave a soft “Youp.” Then
the buck strode higher than usual and the obstacle
was negotiated. And so the race continued with
a constant succession of “ youps ” something after
this fashion : “ Youp, YOUP, youp, YOUP,
youp, youp,” and so on. The louder the gin yelled
the higher the nigger jumped. But Nemesis was
waiting on this colored brother. The flight of the
weighted insect led him directly towards a fallen
tree-head. As they approached, the gin was
measuring it with her eye. Finally, she
appeared to conclude that the “tchillan” I
had promised could not be earned without
some little risk, and she chanced it. A stride
from the obstacle she gave a “youp” that
curdled my blood. The nigger shot into the air
as though driven by a catapult, caught his foot in
one of the higher branches, and came a most awful
cropper. I rushed round the head of the tree and
found his lordship sitting up, with his waist-belt
in his hand, and remarking, to no one in particu-
lar, “ o—le —gose ! ’Possum-skin all broke.” So
was his own skin in a number of places, but this
did not seem to trouble him.

THE BIRD IN THE TRER (excitedly, to Adam):
“ Snakes! ”
“D.H.R.”: One still remaining conse-
quence of the protracted drought is that fish life
in many of the N.S.W. out-back streams is at a
very low ebb. The Oastlereagh, which was at
one time quite noted for its abundance of fish, and
was the resort and living of individuals with vans
and lines and nets —the pernicious net —is now
almost destitute of anything with a fin ; and even
the shrimp has mostly gone to the Halls of Jasper
and other celestial spots. In the Barwon too, not
to mention the Namoi, Mooni, and numerous
other creeks and streamlets where fish was once
very abundant, it is now a novelty to catch one.
The scarcity has become even more pronounced
since the drought broke, and it is to be greatly
feared that unless a long close season is imposed
the fish will become altogether extinct.
BEYOND THE AVERAGE .
SOAKING SAM (in hushed and reverent tones):
“ Wonderful man , ain't he? That's his
sixtieth whisky he's just finishing. Almost a
freak, ain't he?”
BILL THE BRER EATER: “Fkeak! Great Scotl
he ain't a freak, he's a genius.”
“Ed.” : Stepping on to a snake is a mild
thrill compared with the horror of having a
goanna run up one’s body.
When disturbed, the loath-
some, clinging brutes, with
their sharp claws, will run
up whatever happens to be
nearest and looks like a tree
or a tree-stump. If the most
upright object in the neigh-
borhood chances to be
human, that human will get
a thrill which will last a
lifetime. The only way to
get quit of the brute is to
lie down and roll; it leaves
then for something upright
and stationary. Goannas
eat anything—beetles, car-
cases of animals in all stages,
eggs, moths, young and old
birds, frogs, snakes, lizards—
nothing comes amiss. Their
bite is one to be remem-
bered ; they close their jaws
with a snap, and hold until
the piece of flesh comes out.
Dogs bitten by them almost
invariably bleed to death ;
if it is a simple bite, with-
out tearing the flesh, mor-
tification, caused by the
poisonous, decaying food
particles from their teeth,
often sets in. The goanna
takes life easily. He feeds
well in the summer, puts on
plenty of fat until autumn,
and when he is well lined
and the weather gets
cold, he creeps into a
hollow tree and sleeps and
smells until early summer.

“ Cripper ” : Horrible is the appetite of
the lunatic of a peculiar senile type. Stones,
sticks, buttons, anything in fact that fit into the
mouth go down. A Mahometan in the Ballarat
(Yic.) Asylum, some few years ago, on being
opened up after death delivered up some of the
asylum’s strayed cutlery. Four forks, three
knives, a couple of large spoons, and a multitude
of buttons and unconsidered trifles, all of which
the doctor said had nothing to do with causing
death. A man I once had under observation
would chew up anything within reach. I noticed
blood about his mouth, and on sponging the same
away could not discover any wound or open sore.
I watched him closely but stealthily, and nearly
made a break for the clear outside world when I
found him jabbing his teeth into his forearm, to
which he hung with the tenacity of a starved wolf
when interrupted.

T’other day
a cocky up
Cockadoo-

locally- bred
dairy cattle.
No other lo-

Gippslan d

dropping off

ky thought
it his duty
to write to
the depart-

up came an
inspector.
He put a lot
of q ues-
tions ; asked
if anybody
had seen
any snakes
around, &c.,
ordered a mix-
ture, sampled
the deca nte r,
and passed out
with the very re-
assuring- instruc-
tion to Cocky to be
sure and wire if any
more animals died, which
several more beasts did ac-
cordingly. Cocky then wasted
another 9d., and up came an-
other panjandrum. This gent looked
as if he really desired to learn some-
thing. He held a defunct milker’s tail while he put a few
questions about poisoned pollard ; then dropped the
source of his inspiration, kicked the dead cow’s stomach
professionally, noted the absence of lucerne distension
symptoms, and looked puzzled. Then he looked up his
pocket-book for inspiration, put another set of questions
to the lamenting cocky and a score of his neighbors
hanging round, anxious to know if an epidemic was pro-
mised. Queries proved resultless. At this point one of
the cockies said that he’d recently noticed a small weed
with a pucey-green, yallery-purple flower, such as he’d
never seen growing around before. Then all the cookies
remembered seeing this same flower, and had worn it in
their buttonholes to church, but it had only been around
since Socialism started. They fell over one another in
trying to find a specimen, but without result; which, of
course, proved the dead kine had eaten it out of exist-
ence, hence their demise. The expert thereupon looked
wiser than ever, and told the cocky to move his remain-
ing cows to another paddock (which had already been
done), and impressed upon him the efficacy of Epsom
salts when the beast’s tails waggled limp. Then he bade
adieu sadly. No more stock died in that quarter, and
the matter promised to be forgotten, when lo ! four
weeks later the daily papers came out with columns of
balderdash, telling how a mysterious disease had broken
out in the Oockadoodledoo district, that it was baffling
the experts, that it was unlike the measles, but some-
thing like the mumps, only not so much so, with a symp-
tom here and there of empty-decanteritis, and the rest of
it, the wise summing up of the whole matter being that
the disease was a new one, and appeared indigenous to
the country ; hence nothing could be done, except that
Epsom salts and telegraph-forms be kept handy in case of
another outbreak !

“ J.C.” : No Maori feast or Maori tangi
is complete without the quaint ceremony of the
tuku-kai, the “bringing of the food.” Up from
the cooking-ovens at the rear of the camp jog a
number of girls and youths in a long line, each
carrying a flax basket of pork, potatoes, fish, etc.
—roast rib of white man is “off” nowadays.
They advance towards the expectant guests with
a swaggering gait, a sort of “ Here-we-come-
gathering-nuts-and-may ” aspect, chanting a lively
song, the black-eyed damsels wriggling like
Nautch girls. The occasional intermixture of
English phrases with Maori chants is amusing.
For instance, here is a certain tuku-kai song I
heard a gang of young bloods at Rotorua bawl
out lustily as they danced into the meeting-square,
laden with hard ship-biscuits, their contribution
to the feast: —
Maori Lingo. Translation.
He alia te pihikete 1 What are the biscuits for ?
PihikeU } The biscuits ?
Hei whakapiri hi to taha o Why, to stick close along-
te kau. side the beef !
r, i. „ j, j, . (imitating the ante-mortem,
Ooh-ooh-ooh 1 bellow of the “ beef ”).
What-oh she pump !
And at the word “pump” each cheery coon
bumped his quota down beside the boiled beef
and the spuds with a thud energetic enough to
shatter the most adamant of “ hard tack.”

Significant message from the Land of the
Great Drought by W. G. Stuart Russell, of Yel-
verton, to Queensland Weather Bureau :
Words in common use fail to describe the hideous pro-
cess of desiccation now being endured. Great tracts of
thousands of square miles are utterly waterless. The
Oloncurry-Camooweal mail passes to-day for the last
time, and residents here must beat a retreat for personal
safety to Camooweal, 50 miles west. The outlook for
domestic animals left behind is hopeless.
If only half the enterprise and energy wasted in
the Far West had been spent on the coast, what a
difference there would be in the position of affairs
to day !
“Vigilans”: The other day I struck a
buffalo shooter’s camp in the Northern Territory.
A splendid specimen of the white race, assisted
by two Mongolians, six niggers and their lubras,
did the shooting. The white man had spent most
of his 5G years in the N.T., with sundry trips to
Asia. He was in great nick and as hard as nails.
Lived on damper, buffalo and post-and-rail tea,
with an occasional tot of rum. Said he: “The
N.T. is all right for Europeans. Climate is
healthy, and fever only a bogey. The harder you
work the better you are; it’s only drones that kick
up a row about the climate. Hope to die in the
Territory.” The daily bag averaged 10 beasts.
Horses are perfectly trained ; will wear a beast
down and run right up alongside for you to shoot.
They seem to have the sport; the man has the
business.

“Timbarra”: Passing through Wanga-
ratta (Vic.), the other week, I saw a Hindu
hawker anchoring his turnout in front of a store.
First he passed the reins through the front off
wheel and tied them round the lamp-bracket.
Then he chain-locked the wheels on both sides. I
thought this was all, but he next produced two
pairs of hobbles and coupled up the fore and hind
legs of his remarkably sleepy-looking gee-gee.
After this he backed off and critically surveyed
the fastenings, as if in doubt. I suggested that
he should get a length of rope, fix one end round
a large gum tree that stood in front of the store,
and tie the other end all round the cart. He said
that my idea was a brilliant one, but he had no
rope; then he remarked in Hindu that I was the
father of a burnt pig.

“ Hamer ” : The weird things one sees in
delirium are generally not absolute creations of
the imagination, but creative imaginations built
on a derangement of the optic faculties. Thus I
have seen a man imagining that a spider perched
in a distant corner was a grotesque monster
straddled over him binding him with ropes—his
upset focus brought the thing right on top of him.
Was out with a party, one of whom, in a state of
“ recovery,” suddenly focussed some ants wrongly
and yelled to us to save ourselves from “the
monsters,” while he cleared over the ground and
banged himself against things. Posts or hangings
on a bed or spots on the coverlet become converted
into snakes and spiders by a man with the horrors,
whilst in plain delirium, without any trimmings,
equally weird fancies will build themselves on
nothing in particular. I have imagined a pillow
left on the bed was George Reid sitting on top of
me.
* * * *
“Janor”: On the outskirts of a Vic.
mining town I came across two Australian kiddies
playing at mining the other day. They were
sinking a small shaft on a quartz leader in soft
sandstone, and were down about 14ft. Had a
whip stick rigged, and a large wether goat on the
job as whip-horse. As I neared the shaft the top-
man, or rather boy, sent down the hide bucket and
called out to his mate below to send up his blunts
and come up for crib. Just then he overbalanced
and flew down the shaft. The clatter alarmed the
goat, which bolted, ran the bucket up to the
pulley with a bang that broke the rope, and dis-
appeared in a cloud of dust. The bucket bumped
down the shaft on to the nippers. I took the
place of the recently-departed goat and rescued
the entombed miners. They were very much hurt
—at the behavior of their whip-horse, but
undamaged otherwise, and I left them despatching
a huge pasty and swearing vengeance on William.

THE SORROWS OF SATAN.
[ FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dear Sir, —
I have the honor, by command
Of his Satanic Majesty (D.G.),
To beg- that you will publish in your land
This protest ’gainst some things that should not be
His Lowness having culled and sorted well
Types of all damned—each family and genus
(Showing thereby, though you and I in Hell
Appear alike, there may be much between us)
Around the walls, in order, these exhibits
Arranged like writhing bugs on pins impaled,
A notice, in asbestos paint, prohibits
Sticks and umbrellas, and a space is railed.
Dear Sir, you will pronounce it, when you see ’em,
A grand collection. ’Twas the work of years.
His Lowness really thought that his museum
Was quite complete ; but now, Sir, he has fears.
The other day, the boatman brought a load in—
Assorted souls, some from your sunny land
(Each one had his own special trade-mark blowed in
The bottle, and each had his proper brand).
You sent a soul, Sir (kindly try and trace him),
A flat and florid perishable line.
With “ Boodles, U.5.A.,” we fain would place him,
But for his bill of lading and his whine.
Now, Sir, I’ll ask you kindly to imagine us
With all our wall-space full, our lists complete,
Encumbered with a damned soul oleaginous,
A buttered soul, Sir, in this dreadful heat.
And worse, by the last mail, we have received
Advices which would really make one wish
The mail contract was broken, for I’m grieved
To learn the next lot will be Stinking Fish.
Now, Sir, His Lowness orders me to mention,
Though novelty may have a certain charm,
And doubtless you are full of good intention,
The threatened cargo fills us with alarm.
The temperature down here is high at present
(I write this note in somewhat of a hurry),
And Fish, I fear, is bound to be unpleasant.
Yours truly, Blank Blank, Under-Secretary.

includes the name of an individual who poses as

years m Parhament when Parkes appointed him
a Munster of the Crown. The hairy old man.
afterwards explained that he really had to do it
because J.H.C. was the most persistent logroller
in the House.
Passed over recently J. D. Crofts, Ben-
wgn S manager. He was a native of
el >L% No lrt olk (® n g.), and moved to Victoria in
the 50 s. He went to Bendigo soon after landing
and stayed there. He was connected with the
Jjady Barkly Co. ever since its formation in 1866.
Diedrecently, at Launceston (Tas.), aged
68, William Whitaker, founder of the Cornwall

Justice Owen, of N.S.W., is the son of an
army man, who, though an Irishman, com-
manded a Highland regiment. He has a brother
whose surname is Kynaston, the name Owen
being abandoned by royal license to enable him to
assume heirship to the estate of Sir John Kynas-
ton, of Shropshire.
The late Bryan O’Loghlen delivered him-
self of more “bulls’’than any other member of
the Victorian Parliament, though at a mixed
metaphor the late J. G. Francis could beat him
hands down. Had O’Loghlen stuck to his Crown
Prosecutorshi p he would have done better finan-
cially than by plunging into the precarious busi-
ness of polities.
J- W- Thomson, who has represented
Clutha m M.L. House of Reps, for 30 years is
retiring from political life at the age of 80
Ihomson, who was a Minister under Grey, is a
scholarly and very amiable old gentleman, who
never did any harm to anybody, but he once got
his dander up and spoke for 24 hours—the longest
speech ever delivered in the Parliament of Seddon
Land.
DILL! DILL! DILL!
Remarked in England that King Ned, when
doing his Continental jaunts, is not attended by a
oec. of State, and frequently has policy inter-
views with other monarehs without the presence
of a responsible Minister, which custom requires.
Apparently there is something in the tale that
King Ned aspires to be a little more than an
affable rubber stamp in the scheme of Govern-
ment.
B. D. Morehead, Lumley Hill, and Oscar
.Ue Satge constituted themselves a third party in
the Queensland Parliament long before the Labor
party was heard o f. The three pledged themselves
to light Griffith on one side and MTlwraith on
the other, and for a little time almost held the
balance of power. But Morehead joined M‘ll-
- and Hill and De Satge quarrelled, and the
third party disappeared.
“ Huffin-Guffin ” : Met Hart, the sacked
ex-president of the Vic. Locomotive Engineers’
Association, the other afternoon. He was navvy-
ing, and he can “keep his end up” at the work
too. From driving a locomotive at 14s. a day to
dittoing a wheelbarrow at 6s. is what may happen
to a man m Victoria for his sins of Unionism,
i et Hart was cheerful, and only spoke sorrow-
fully when referring to the fact that some of his
former mates thought that he and ex-secretary
Scorer were guilty of accepting br'bes in connec-
tion with the termination of the strike. It is a
itij el accusation, and Hart’s present occupation
should clear him from the charge for ever. Scorer
is running a small suburban wood-yard, and does
not get his old fellow workmen’s custom to the
extent he should.
James Mirams says he will offer him-
self for a Labor constituency at the next
v ictorian State elections.' Janies is a
lonely and pathetic figure in the
streets of the city just now. The
men of his former circle, when Pre-
mier Permanent affairs were
blooming, find little difficulty
m gazing ahead of the very
small man when he and his
never neglected “gamp”
heave in sight. Mirams
advocated such fea-
tures of the Labor
platform as a State
Bank, no further
alienation of Crown
Lands, Land-tax
and One Adult
One Vote, a good
twenty-five years
ago—in fact he
was a Labor
man before
there were any
Labor men so-
called. In
spite of finan-
cial ruin, heavy
domestic be-
reavement and
the weight of
over 70 years,
he is as chirpy
astheyoungest
A.N.A. young man
who aches to serve
his country. It is
mighty few men who
remain young at his
age ; still fewer who
remain good demo-
crats. And Victoria
owes Mirams a re-
paration. When his
Premier Permanent
institution burst it
put him in gaol for six
months for being over san-
guine. It was in a moral
mood then. After that almost
everything burst, and Victoria
found that if it was going to
keep up to the same high level
of Roman fortitude it would have
to give about half its leading
citizens 20 years. So it decided to whitewash
everybody except Mirams.
English papers treat the eccentricities of
Tommy Bent exactly as we treat those of out-of-the-
way American celebrities. Reading of Tommy’s
escapades, as presented by the British journalist,
we find that he is regarded very much as a wild
man from Borneo _ or a woolly Texan, whereas
Tommy, after all, is only a bit of a cheerful ass,
and we have known greater asses who had dignity
enough to sit in a congress of bishops.
Benjamin Lee, for many years a softgoods
bush salesman, later a member of N.S.W. Par-
liament, and later still stipendiary magistrate,
was hale and cheery while celebrating his eightieth
birthday recently. He is not quite an Australian
?^r’^* ha ? bee ?. knocking about N.S.W. since
1829. His father died at 91. Pa Lee was a light
dragoon, and helped Wellington to win a number
of battles.
James Norton, father of N.S.W. Legis-
lative Council, is now in his eighty-second year
His father was also an M.L.C., and kept in harness
if anything in the Upper House can be called
harness— till his death at 81. The first of the
family known to Australia was John Norton of
Leatherhead, who dropped into Sydney about
1819 and took firm root. The present James
Norton was appointed to the Council in 1879 and
was once some kind of a Postmaster-General.
The bizarre mixture of Liberalism and
Toryism, which Lord Rosebery presents off and
on as Australian democratic sentiment, is attri-
buted in large part to his association with Dan’l
Cooper, the Australian absentee. Dan’l and
Rosebery went to Oxford together, and later
went on the turf together, and Dan’l is pleased to
be of service to his native land by telling people
what he thinks would be good for it, when he
can do so without telling them what he thinks
would be bad for Dan’l Cooper, absentee.
xr Mj llar d, M.L. A., the unfortunate
. . VV- solicitor and politician whose habit of
mixing whisky and business got him into a foolish
little trouble over a confused item of £5, claimed
at his trial to have won the Victoria Cross at some
back period of his history. But the published
lists of surviving V.C. men dpn’t include his name
so possibly this is a mere delusion. Anyhow the
Cross doesn t always go by merit. Many a man
has deserved it for the battle he put up against
fan tods and blue centipedes, with no weapon in
his hand save an empty bottle, and his bravery
has been quite overlooked.
The wedding at Neutral Bay (Sydney) of
Miss Moseley, daughter of Captain MoSey,
formerly of the 60th Rifles, and now a solicitor in
Sydney, recalls the expedition under Colonel
Barney in the forties to found a new colony in
the north. The vessel with the Colonel and his
staff and some legal officials, was wrecked on an
island- The party which included William
Wnaley Billyard, who had been appointed Crown
Solicitor of the new settlement, included but
°? e , lady* Mrs. Billyard, the grandmother
of the recent bride. She did the cooking,
&a, and was a mother to the wrecked party gene-
raliy On the morning of the rescue she had
jaked her last loaf, and had to enlarge it bv
adding to the last lot of flour the bran from her
pincushion.
Mr. Henry Cary Dangar, ML C a
plutocrat of N.S.W. Leg. Council, recently‘said
that, thirty years ago, Mr. W. C. Wentworth,
the father of the Constitution,” told him (Mr.
Dangar) that, if he had foreseen then what
Responsible Government was going to -bring this
colony to, he would have cut out his tongue before
he said a word m its favor. Wentworth has been
dead over 33 years, anyhow, and it is 43 years
since he was last m Australia. Wentworth was
for self always, and wanted everything cheap.
He and other plutocrats yearned for a resumption
of transportation so that they might have labor
for nothing, barring the rations and a suit of slops
once a year. The Dangars made their money
under similar conditions.
FORGE OF HABIT.
COHEN : “ Did you hear that Levy's got appen-
dicitis ? ”
I SAACS: “ I’ll bet you a quid it's in his wife’s
name! ”
Australian Attorney-General Isaacs, who
is only some 25 years at the Bar, began early to
put his figures up, and receive them too, both
from the Vic. Government and private litigants.
The first time he was brought to Sydney his brief
was marked £5OO, which was so out of proportion
to the fees of the local men retained to act with
him that they refused to go on. The matter was
compromised, but it is understood that Mr. Isaacs
obtained every £ he bargained for.
An Australian Premier walked on a recent
Saturday night from his capital’s Town Hall to
the railway station supported by a Legislative
Councillor and a commercial magnate. Out of an
oyster-shop rushed an hilarious youth who, with a
demon yell, leapt on the beefy back that carries
the weight of Government, and bashed the hat of
the head of the State down on its ears. But it
was so obviously the natural sort of joke to play
on that Premier that nobody took any particular
notice of the incident.
“L.” : Alfred Deakin is a study, as he
wriggles and twists in his place in the House of
Reps. I started to take his record for two
minutes : Sat squarely in his seat and clasped
his fingers over chest. Twirled the thumbs
round and round. Pulled up right trouser-leg.
Tugged at watch-chain with left hand. Turned '
up corner of waistcoat, apparently looking for
a pin. Stuck two fingers between his collar
and his throat. Crossed left leg over right
and rubbed left ankle. Ditto, legs re-
versed. Planted his feet before him and
hugged his knees. Swung his head side-
ways to smile at Page. Bounced two
feet on the seat (apparently without
muscular action) to speak rapidly to John
Forrest. Stuck his thumbs in his arm-
pits, spread his feet—and sprang from
this attitude to step hurriedly from the
chamber, and even then there were 45
seconds of the two minutes to go. On
the opposite side of the room, behold
Knox. What a contrast ! Eyes closed,
hands clasped, knees well apart —no
movement except that of his breath
lifting his bulk gently up and down.
Always the same. No sooner had the
Northern Territory Chow who got on the new
Bynoe Harbor tin-rush made his few thousands,
than he pouched it and sailed off to China to spend
it. And he was naturalised, too. For all the good
it has been to Australia, that tinfield might almost
as well never have been discovered. Yet still they
cry for colored labor.
“ Bill ” : ’Twould be interesting to know
whence All About Australians gleaned its
information concerning the Willis family (B.
26/10/’O5). Nicholas must have been a very old-
fashioned youth when his father, John Willis,
“ went to ’Frisco and died there.” Long after
Nicholas had been returned to Parliament, John
Willis worked in a farrier’s shop in Armidale
(N.S.W.), situated at the corner of Beardy and
Rusden-streets, and entertained the rustics with
marvellous tales anent his son, “ the member.”
Also, Mrs. Willis, mother of the future land-
agent, whom “John left to rear the family,” had
gone over, and John had consoled his lonely life
by marrying the widow Smitheringale, relict of an
old New England pioneer. About eight years ago
John suddenly departed from Armidale, and no
more was heard of him. Government made pro-
vision for the twice-bereaved lady by appointing
her caretaker of the local public offices. Some-
body has been elongating the tibia belonging to
A. A. A.
“Jay” : Ex-Premier Boyd D. Morehead,
of Queensland, recently ' deceased, grew very
testy in his later days. I remember being at a
little suburban station one morning, accompanied
by my dog, when B.D.M. happened along. Dog,
being one of the friendly, lick-you-all-over sort,
capered up and rested a pair of persuasive paws on
Morehead’s waistcoat. The old man spluttered an
imprecation and kicked the dog hard in the i'ibs,
whereupon the dog, taking the kick as part of the
game, playfully seized his trousers. Then they
both got excited and the air became thick with
dog, and grey tweed, and scandalised station-
master, and ex-Premier with murder in his eye.
Disliking such degrading spectacles, I left hur-
riedly for home. A remnant of dog with a scared
expression turned up a little later.
Amid a confusion of reports from the
U.S. it is hard to sort out the story of Mr.
‘‘Friday ” Ellis, of Australia, and his row with
that American poker-player, who recently did a
good deal towards cleaning out the Sydney
National Sporting Club. It seems certain that
there was a quantity of blood scattered about a
house in San Francisco, and that the damage done
to “Friday” Ellis made him a fearsome-looking
pony-owner. One report is that the gentleman
who damaged and robbed “Friday” fled with his
wife and the plunder while his victim was away
showing his injuries to the police. Another is
that, finding he hadn’t killed “Friday,” he killed
his wife and then committed suicide. At all
events, certain Sydney poker and billiard people
don’t much mind who is dead so long as somebody
is dead. Some of them still feel so mad that they
would almost be glad to hear that everybody was
dead.
Seldom do Australians hear a Cheeke now
talked of, though the Judge of that name was
once an important person in Sydney society. The
name re-emerges casually in connection with the
Dailey divorce case, parties to the case and the
Cheekes in London being on visiting terms
Judge Cheeke was a legal adventurer who took
Sydney for his oyster. He got on to the District
Court Bench, and later pushed up to a seat oil
the Supreme Bench. A nephew (George) was an
apprentice in the navy, but finding deck work
hard, followed uncle to Sydney and climbed up
beside him as Associate. This George was more
remarkable than the uncle; he made a great
spfeh in society of 40 years ago, and married Long’s
third daughter, becoming thus brother-in-law to
James Martin and W. B. Dailey. George Cheeke
returned to England on the death of his uncle,
and was generally accepted there as the Judge
Cheeke of N.S.W. Supreme Court. The real
w! • 6 ee k. e was an inveterate sportsman,
j hile a District Court Judge he ran horses under
the name of Tait (John Tait was his partner), and
while Supreme Court Judge he ran under the
name of Jack Chafe.
“ J.N.” writes :
In conjunction with A. B. Buchanan, the late B. D.
Morehead, once Premier of Queensland, started the well-
known Queensland pastoral firm, which bears his name.
The former found the cash, and the latter was supposed
to supply the experience. In the eighties this firm had
practmally the stock and station business of Queensland
within its grasp. In his palmy days, Morehead would no<-
tolerate interference of any description. One iorp :
startled the Brisbane branch of the Onion Bah* oy
demanding payment in gold for a fifty thousand pound
cheque because the bank demurred to cashing the usual
drovers orders without at once getting the firm’s cheque
in exchange. His political life in the Assembly was
brought to a close by old Beattie, the hatter, who
defeated him by a two-to-one majority for Fortitude
Valley. Morehead was supposed to have the best of
chances for this electorate, but the figures went the
wrong way. Morehead lived to see the remains of his
once fine business, and the rest of his worldly possessions
pass into the hands of others. At the time of his death
he was receiving certain remuneration from the Legisla-
tive Council, and the Q.N. Bank made him an allowance
as chairman of Moreheads Ltd. The collapse of B. P.
Morehead will hold its own amongst the many sensations
provided by the MTlwraith party.

tion was confirmed on appeal, but in the end was
quashed on technical grounds. White’s defence

Palace Emporium,
The Salv’army is now teaching Melbourne
another point in the exact science of cadging. It
sends round strapping able-bodied men and lasses
to beg left-off clothes, etc., ostensibly to be given
to the poor; but, in place of giving these as freely
as they were received, it sells them to the hard-up
applicants “to save their self-respect.” Mani-
festly, the Army’s self-respect doesn’t need
saving—it hasn’t any.
“Lam ” writes :
It seems of little use to establish minimum wages in the
Commonwealth postal service while the contract post
office is allowed to grow plentifully. Instances were men-
tioned the other night in the Australian Parliament.
Webster (N.S.W.) quoted a post office “near Sydney,”
which used to be run by Government at an annual cost of
£5OO. Now a contractor undertakes to supply premises,
a postmaster, two letter-carriers (with horses) and one
telegraph messenger (with bicycle)—all for £290 a year.
Maloney (Vic.) followed with a mail contractor who ten-
dered at rates which involved a man and horse covering
14 miles over a bad road for ]|d. Apart from contracts
(according to Maloney) the minimum wage is often not
paid. Even the telegraph boy is stalled off with less than
his statutory 10s. a week. And the telegraph boy, under
Commonwealth regulations, may be a hulking youth of 17.
This opens up a difficult question. The unofficial
post-office is necessary. In places where the
business is very small it is absurd to keep a build-
ing solely for postal purposes, and a staff to do
two hours’ work per day, and loaf the rest of the
time. It is necessary, in the interests of economy,
to combine postal business with grocery or some
similar job in such cases. The only thing that can
be done is to see that the contractor’s employees
receive adequate pay, and make that the basis of
the contract.

Peerless
Gloss
puts a permanent gloss on boots and
shoes—a shine that outshines all other
shines; a brightness that is not dulled
by a little damp, but remains as long as
actual dirt and mud can be warded off.
It is this great and special quality that
that makes it worthy of its name —
“ Peerless ” ; that is, absolutely without
an equal. Famed for forty years, it is still
pre-eminently the best shoe polish that
has ever been invented. It adds to the
life of a shoe by its preservative qualities,

is but the work of a moment to apply it.

Not Vamping, but actually Playing TUNES with Both Hands
ANYONE GAN LEARN IT FAILURE IS IMPOSSIBLE
All the Difficulties of Ordinary Music Swept Away. No Sharps and Flats.
No Scales and Keys. Everything simple. You play a Tune at the
First Attempt. Approved by the Highest Musical Authorities.
TX7HEN, in June last, we introduced this wonderfully easy system of piano and organ playing
v v we felt confident that it would be well received, but the result has far exceeded our most
sanguine anticipations. Hundred after hundred of the books have been sold, and the demand
increases as one purchaser recommends another. There has not been a single complaint. Orders
for more music are pouring in, with such comments as “Itis so simple you can understand it
almost at the first glit nee. I have had it only a little over a week and can play nearly all the
tunes.’ —(Miss A. Mitchell, Nireha, N.Z.) 4i I have completely mastered the book without a teacher,
and find no difficulty in reading the music at sight.”—(Mr. N. A. Saunders, Moor Street, Fitzroy.j
44 1 can play several of the pieces without any difficulty. I really cannot say enough in praise of
such a wonderful book.” —iMiss Julia Evans, Keyneton, S.A.) “Within one week of purchasing
the book 1 could play any tune correctly from it To accomplish this under the old style of musie
would have taken me at least twelve months’ hard practice.”— (Mr. A. Fountain, Wanganui, N.Z.,)
and so on. Herr tiduard scharf, professor of pianoforte playing at the Melbourne Conservatorium,
approves of the system as ,4 very practical and ingenious.” and 44 can see no objection to it.”
By this system anyone, without the slightest knowledge of music, can, within one hour, learn to
play the piano or organ with both hands, that is, PLAY TUNES, both the melody and tho
accompaniment, practically at first sight. 44 It is as easy as reading the newspaper,” as one of our
customets said. The new style of music shows you just the notes you have to touch to produce the
tune, you press them and the music sounds just as effectively as if you were a practised player.
This seems almost impossible, but it is a fact. By this new system you can master the
piano in a few weeks without the aid of a teacher, whether you know anything about
ordinary music or not. It sweeps away all the difficulties of sharps and flats, scales and keys and major and minor modes
and indeed it overcomes all the intricacies of the old notation by proving that excellent musio can be produoed without
any knowledge of theory or harmony. To make a homely comparison, it is like eating a good dinner without knowing any-
thing about cookery. Anyone can eat a good dinner and anyone can play by this new method ; the one is as easy as the
other, and you may leave to other people the trouble of cooking the meal and arranging the music. You can enjoy both
The price of the book is only ss. 3d , iuc.udinsr postage to any address, and it is very eheap, even regarded as sheet musie,
for the book contains, besides instructions and illustrative passages, over twenty musical selections, inoluding four ballads,
complete with music, words and accompaniments; five waltzes, four other dances, a march, an operatic romanoe, five
patriotic airs, two sacred selections Ac. As an additional inducement to early purchasers, we have decided to offer & full
year’s subscription to 44 The Musical Monthly,” a high-class magazine in which a complete piece of music in the new
system is published every mouth. Send one shilling to cover postage, and yea will receive the magazine for a year, con-
taining twelve pieces of music ordinarily published at Is. 6d. eaoh, besides a whole year’s excellent reading on musical sub-
jects. This very liberal offer is available for only two months from the date of this paper, therefore, you should order at
once. Send 6s. 3d. in postal notes of any State for the Book and the Magazine, or ss. 3d. for the Book only to

thundered out “ The Noblest Crown is the Ring
of Sweat around the brow of a Working Man ! ”
The fat man-in a front pew nodded approval,
with a pair of puce kid gloves folded over his
abdomen, a whity sepulchre for turkey and cham.
—not sham. We tip Labor a bit of honorable
bunkum —“A man’s a man for a’ that,” and so on

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
MrD«ABABI KI ._ SIDMI ' H 1905.
Chief Justice Darley, just made a P.C. as a
Jiing s birthday present, is a good walker for a
seventy-sixer. He may often be seen, when the
day is a pieasant one waiking into the city from
his Darlmghurst residence “ Quambi” and padding
back in like fashion. Walking is the up-to-date
exeFCISe.
At the Review on Saturday the C. J.’s consort
made a purple patch on the timber erection from
which some six Chocolate Creams viewed the
march past of the Waler section of the army. She
was ail in royal-hued silk, from sky-raking toque
to the tip of a long tail, and as she is some stones
lighter than a few years ago, the Chief-
tainess of Justice looked —well, as Pinero’s
smart people say, ripping. Bearing her com-
Mrs. Gordon (the commandant’s
wife), Mrs. Oswald Watt, in a hat like an
extinguisher, and her marvellous neck furred with
the costly skin of some dead animal. Marvellous
necks aren t usual except in early womanhood.
A review of even a very small army is a dra-
matic sight. The long bright line of helmets,
bayonets, scarlet and gold jackets, and tan and
white men, all coming out of the sunset and
swinging' along’ to the base where the Commandant
stood ; all pacing with a measured, machine-like
stride—it made one think of the war-verse of
Macaulay, and the Assyrians in their blue mantles,
and of Bland Holt’s squadrons. A review is a
better picture than the battle-pieces that spoil my
appetite in various dining-rooms where I feed in
the city. Why should one be faced with engrav-
ings of dead and dying gunners, and mangled
horses, and the smoke of burning villages, whilst
eating the peaceful lamb and harmless ver-
dant pea ? There is too much Butler in Sydney
hotel dining-halls. Away with Roll Calls,
Quatre Bras and Inkerman, and give us pictures of
Centennial Park, and our own army capering before
the eyes of the Commanding Goat. (This is writ
quite respectful. Remember the he-goat with the
notable horn between his eyes in Scripture ? He
was no common or garden goat, and he stamped
down rams and other stock that would war against
him.) lhen in hot weather let the pictures in the
dining-room be changed, and Jet us have a cool
green sea, and a cool green rock in the midst
thereof, and a cool green mermaid sitting on the
rock, and scraping her green jaw with her green
Dana, and nicking the sea with her cool green tail.
One ticklesome detail of the march-past the
saluting-point was the interested scrutiny by our
citizen soldiery of the women seated in the roped-
ln space. Officers kept up the stony, impassive
. e J es front ” expression, but the ranks mostly
just stared with frank curiosity.
Prince Ferdinand of Savoy, who arrives here in
the poetically-named Calabria, is a very long-
l®B’Bed, long-necked, thin, blonde young man in
the early twenties. A long-pointed nose, a short-
pointed beard, a moustache pointing angel-
wards, and a fascinating manner are some of his
points.” Also—Sydney society, and Sydney
declasse, will please remember—he is a total
abstainer and won’t take any gay trips to the
.National Park. This cruise is part of his edu-
cation a sort of glorified kindergarten effort.
women will find the commander of the
Calabria, Count Something Moriondo, the most
shining piece of ordnance on the ship. He is as
tall as a mast—some masts—and has “a strong
serious face.” Perhaps it is as well to add that
he has a wife. A group of the officers is strongly
musical. The T. H. Kellys will be glad to learn
that this group would pursue a diminishing
seventh on foot from the Quay to Rose Bay.
One of the Big Wool Winchcombes returned
last week from abroad in time for the season’s
fleece sales. Had a look at an auction at the
Jtxchange last week. A dog show is a deaf mute
jn comparison. To be a successful wool-
bidder and catch the auctioneer’s eye and ear you
must have rubber joints, and patent hinges ail
over your body, and a voice that yaps and whistles
and bellows. You must be something between a
fire m a lunatic asylum and an enraged zoological
garden with a little of a dancing dervish and
a howling monkey thrown in. This season’s
shearing is the best since the drought, and the
wool is of record cleanness. Amongst the wool-
ffrowers in the sales chamber—men in rusty
- 6S bashed Panama hats mostly—was
William Broun, the tenth baronet of his name
(family invented in Sixteen something). He con-
descends to live on a station near Manila (N.S. W.)
and raise the ram and ewe, and grow red-faced
and remain in ignorance of the Piccadilly Droop!
The Brouns have a family spook, but so far she
hasn t got out to Manila. She was blocked by
the Education Test though she was able to haunt
in four languages.
Stated by Justice Cohen, in N.S.W. Divorce
Court, that it is doubtful whether the marriage of
Jews by a Christian minister is valid, though
their marriage by a Jewish Rabbi or a registrar
would certainly be legal. To avoid all points of
thatsort, the law should insist on the civil marriage
ceremony before a State official in every case.
Parties could then indulge, as an extra, in what-
ever sort of religious ceremony they chose.
Announced that the widowed youngest daughter
of the Darleys, Lady Carmichael Anstruther, is to
marry, next month, Major Hanbury-Tracey
second son of Baron Sudeley. Bridegroom elect
is 34 years of age. Rhona, a sister of his, was
here a while ago on a visit to the Northcotes. The
Anstruther and Tracey families are already related
t>y marriage.
I didn’t attend the Anglican Synod, held re-
cently in Sydney—in fact I never spoke to a synod
m my life—but a correspondent sends me this
about it:—
At the recent Anglican Synod in Sydney, a full-blooded
rijian (in full Fijian dress, which consists largely of long
brown bare leg's) attended as a member, with as powerful
a vote as any of ’em. He was the first colored man to
sit in an Australian Federal Assembly of an3 r kind. Some-
one jogged the Primate’s elbow and suggested he should
say a few words on “ this occasion.” Bishop Mercer rose,
stammered something, laughed and said, “ I don’t know
what to say—Edward, stand up!” “Edward” raised
himself on his long brown legs, bowed, and said,
Tanks.”
A correspondent on the alleged baneful influence
exercised over woman by education :
R seems to me that this baneful influence is to be
credited rather to over-dressing. In America are made at
present the loudest outcries about the birth-rate and
about the evil of over-education, but in America, also, is
Pasliion gone mad; The great majority of its women have
not had the advantage of what is called higher education.
, Australia it is not over-education that is answer-
Jvy®. ,the raising of the age of marriage and for
the falling of the birth-rate. The State school course
is elementary, the greater number of girls attending these
schools do not attain even to this standard, while, of
those who do so attain, few go further. Private schools
generally show a more ambitious spirit, on paper, and
supply less education. Only a small proportion of girls
, a course °f secondary school instruction, and
a still smaller number complete a University course.
On leaving school—-State, private, or secondary—the
great majority of girls confine their reading to light
fiction, fashion and gossip snippets.
On the other hand, consider the dressing displayed in
the city streets and elsewhere. Whatever maybe said
against tus “frocking” from a hygienic and artistic
point of view, it leaves little to be desired from a fashion-
able standpoint. Some of the wearers are wealthy ladies,
but most are not rich, and many are poor, while all
appear fashionably dressed. Semi-starvation is cheer-
tuUy borne that the penny saved may be spent on dress,
and the resulting poor physique is debited to education,
light and uncomfortable clothing, high-heeled shoes, and
an insecure and ridiculous hat, are eagerly accepted as
contributing to a “ smart ” appearance, and the
nervous strain that results from these discomforts,
combined with the loss of the free play of the lungs, is
also debited to education. The mental effort required to
make one pound do the work of 10 or 20, and to persuade
a horde of unreasonable tradesmen to take 10s. a month
on accounts of £5O or so, use up the phosphates neces-
sary for the growth of a child, and that likewise is debited
to education. Those who are concerned about the birth-
rate, and interested in the welfare of the race might
instead of blaming education, .try to institute some
simple, healthful dress of fixed fashion.
Three sisters, members of Mr. Philip Lytton’s
amateur company, drew a £6OOO prize in a recent
sweep. There are live girls in the family, and
they now reckon themselves dowered.
Sydney society resolved itself into one wide
grin, last week, when it learned, through the Mel-
bourne representative of a local daily, that Miss
Burdekin had “come out” at the Government
-House Race Ball. The damsel has been going to
grown-up balls for three seasons, her friends say,
and she has been engaged to be married for a year
or so. At the Northcotes’ ball at our Government
House, early, last winter, the pretty little person
was present. She wasn’t in debutante raiment,
?, e 1 wear what English fashion papers
call an evening frock for a miss.”
Miss Constance Brandon Usher is the invisible
pianiste in the “Merely Mary Ann ” scene when
Gerrard is supposed to be playing his symphonic
poem. ± retty Constance has scores of fluffy girl
friends who seem to think those few bars played
behind a screen bring her greater glory than plat-
form appearances. Also, they’ll tell you that she
gets £8 a week for those nightly non-appear-
ances.
A swell George-street shop is making the
divided, cross-saddle skirts for riding. Demand
for them for up-to-date women learning to
ride is considerable. Medical men have for
long advised the cross-saddle, but Mother Grundy
with her prunes and prisms was hostile.
“ Adelaide ” writes
The eighth “ Federal ” picture show in Adelaide is ab
soiutely dominated by the local men. There are now four
of the latter standing out prominently—Will Ashton
Hayley Lever, Hans Heysen, and Power; all, except
Powei, are lately back from London and Paris. The £250
to be spent annually (out of the Thomas Elder bequest) in
buying Australian work goes this year to Ashton and
Lever. The bydney and Melbourne artists are compara-
bly weak this year. Tom Roberts, Lister-Lister, Long-
staff, Bunny Julian Ashton, and others have all
received good cheques in the past, and perhaps think
there is no chance of being bought again so soon.
Anyway, absent they are. Blamire Young asks 350
guineas for his brilliant pre-Raphaelite portrait-group of
Tennyson reading to his friends. Percy Spence has two
good things, apparently done under American influ-
ence. The Adelaide people are much as usual, the
Hambndge sisters having a group of good miniature and
other portraits, and Ueorge' Webb a really fine study of
the three judg’es who sat as the S.A. Bench for 20 years—
Way, Boucaut, and Bundey. Place of honor on the end
wains givery to Julius Olsson, young Ashton’s teacher in
England. He has sent out two large sea-pieces, and
Adelaide has jumped-at the chance of buying both.
Strong man Sandow has been telling how he
taught his system to Indian ladies of rank. Most
of these, even if beautiful, run to fat, and they
are just as eager as European women to “ lean ”
down a few stone. He did not see his pupils, but
stood in a strongly-lighted room, the women being
in another darkened one, separated from him by a
beaded screen. They proved eager pupils,
and later asked Sandow to put his arm
through the screen so that they might
look at its muscles. This reminds me that
Mr. Erskine Raymond, who used to wear
captain s clothes in the British army, is back in
Sydney, and has re-started his School of Physical
Gulture for hims and hers at 397 George-street.
Health, strength, vitality and will power are some
of the things that come to you with cultivation of
all your joints and muscles. The day will come
when men and vvomen will be forbidden by law to
get very fat, or if they will persist in “lining their
kidneys, as the men out-back say of those grow-
ing adipose, they’ll be forbidden to go about the
streets. Women falling into middle age are the
EMBARRASSING.
worst offenders in the fat line. They won’t be
bothered to keep and “ cultivate ” their figures.
Not much of the “best butter” is back from
Melbourne yet. You remember the March Hare’s
best butter. Among the b.b. at Rosehill races
yesterday were Mrs. Jack Toohey, in a short blue
linen frock ; Mrs. Monty Severn, all indigo blue ;
a squatter girl, Miss Florence Cooke, from Moree,
and Mrs. Irving-Keyes, one of the Deloitte
family, who has come to live in Sydney. The day
was a gusty one, and several wise women had
adopted Madame Louise’s clever arrangement of
veils, so they didn’t look as if they’d been raked
and harrowed.
Gilbertines and Sullivanites, back from the
West, opened their Sydney season with “The
Gondoliers.” A large audience watched through
its opera glasses to find out, if it could, to which of
the pretty little trio of principal girls widower
Kenningham inclines his heart. Then it made
incorrect guesses. Miss Dolly Castles now saves
chaperonage fees, and stays with the Ramaciottis.
. Gne of our Silver-Wyandotte families is rejoic-
ing over the arrival of a new girl—a baby, not a
Mary Ann. Between this cooer and next-in-age
infant there is a gap of nineteen years.
A recent bride of tnis State had amongst her
published list of presents four slip bodices made
out of elegant lace handkerchiefs by one of her
girl friends.
Mrs. Leslie Walford, who was Miss Dolly
Hordern, is bade from foreign parts and staying
with her husband at the Australia.
The Thomas Dibbses —Mr., Mrs. and two
daughters—are amongst the Returned. These
days, if people come back from a tour and are
unable to give their friends a lot of news, the
latter nickname them “the returned empties.”
However, that’s got nothing to do with the Dibbs
family. They are a philanthropic family, and the
banker head of it mentions that in London “he
found Australia and Australians not in fashion just
now.”
. Well-known architect Spain, who has also been
m similar regions, mentions, en causerie, that
after dining with artist Tom Roberts, the latter
produced a brass bowl and a bundle of gum leaves.
With deliberation and reverence, and as if in per-
formance of a religious rite, the leaves were burnt
m the bowl to conjure up “ the Australian atmos-
phere. That sort of thing answers well enough
for Australia, which is wide and free and breezy.
To get the Asiatic atmosphere you would have to
burn some dead bodies. A purely English atmos-
phere could be got by making a bonfire of a top-
hat m a fog.
A cable says that “ the Queen is greatly in-
terested in the movement.” That is in the appeal
now being made in England on behalf of the
(Sydney) Royal Alexandra Hospital for children.
But there is no mention that Her Majesty’s in-
terest took the form of a cheque.
Elocution of actors Gerrard and Gran in
“ Merely Mary Ann,” is awful. I thought I was
getting deaf, and wasn’t going to blame the actors
for what seemed to me their chortlings and
mumblings and clutterings. But the majority
of persons who have seen “Merely M.A.”, say
that Gerrard’s and (especially) Gran’s dialogue is
lost to them. Last-named mime might be talking
with a railway rug tied over his face for all that
his listeners at the back of the circle and stalls can
hear of what he says.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENEH[?].
When one man has shot at another, and
the police have run him in, their first idea seems
to be to ask him his religion. At such a time of
excitement very few men could remember what
their religion was, even supposing they had one.
.rrobably Dill Macky, if he were rushing along
the street with a smoking revolver in his hand”
would hardly remember for the moment if he were
a holy Roman or not. Grant Hervey, after the'
trouble with Walter Baker, said he had no reli-
gion, and no one seems to have asked Baker what
sect he belonged to.

MELBOURNE CHATTER,
Melbourne, November 13, 1905.
My Dear Yarrie,—
There was nothing over-dazzlesome about the
1905 Cup. A temperature that goes with beads
on the brow of the fat man, and a succession of
small and nasty dust-storms were not favorable to
fine apparel. Consequently flutterers wilted in
second-rate clothes, and only a small incon-
sequential section strutted in its very best
fresh-air yoke and league of chiffon tail.
But Lady Northcote was in a wonderful get-up of
rose and orchid shot-satin, with layers of tinted
lace. The head-gear ran to floral excesses, and a
parachute of endless circles of lace. It was a joy-
ous and highly festive Cup rig. The crowd felt
that the Governor-Generaless was that day doing
her duty. The Tasmanian Lady once more wore
sky-blue tints of muslin. An inky hat trailed inky
plumes on its brim. A better example of the
Island style was furnished by Mrs. Charlie Youl,
whose deep orchid chiffons were contrasted with a
top-mast running to red and pink floral garniture.
The Kelso King sisters bounded along in scutty
linens and small hats. The plump blonde of the
family bounces no end.
The three features of the 1905 Cup were less
dress exaggeration, less drinkytite on the part of
the fair sex, and more betting among them. Some
ball-room gowns were flaunted by a few of the
Goths, and some fighting colors were blended by
the brave. But such humors of Cup clothes
occurred at rare intervals. In the refreshment
rooms the full tide of spirits and soda did not flow
over the premises as in former years. Instead,
there was a run on tea and temperance draughts.
The one excess was the amount of betting. I saw
many gorgeously caparisoned women arguing the
point with the booking fraternity and coquetting
them into ‘‘a fair price” on the favorites. A
minor feature of the show was the display of petti-
coats on the part of the fashionables. Mrs.
Everard Browne, Mrs. Harry Payne and Mrs.
Alston Wallace were vivid examples of the poeti-
cally frilled. Dainty colors, fantastic designs, and
a French effusion of ribbons and laces were in
evidence.
The Northcote dance was carried through with
any amount of pomp and dog. Long after the
guests had gathered, the house contingent trooped
in, a double file of caddies leading the way, most
of them aristocratically gone at the knees. The
feminine part of the procession left most of the
rustle trail and gleam to the hostess. That bright
dame had enough for the lot. Her white and
black chiffons had lines of silver moonlight aslant
the skirt, and black Chantilly lace clouding the
corsage and spreading lengthily to the back of the
skirt. Diamonds and emeralds lent a blaze to
head, neck and shoulders. The Tasmanian
Government House dame was in white satin
with purple patches over the material. Her
honeyed thatch was arranged in touzled puffs,
at which Toorak—brilliantined and upholstered
to the highest degree—gazed in amaze-
ment. An outspread pair of dark midnight
wings on the head of Miss Stuart-Wortley was
the one departure from diamonds in the, i •
quarter. The line of demarcation i> v
and the hosts was severely drawn. v;o-
greeting of the Cream. Once arrived, the North-
cotes permitted the programme' to proceed—the
dame overlooking the crowd with the help of a
refrigerating lorgnette. It was impossible to
catch the Yice-Regal eye. It wasn’t to be caught.
At 11 o’clock a bugle-call announced supper, and
the Northcote troop, with Mrs. Deakin and a
dozen other official personages, proceshed to the
special buffet. Their Exes, then went to bed, but
they allowed the gas to keep burning for the
dancers who wanted to use up the band music.
A Sydney daine wore the most uncommon dress
at the Northcote ball. This was Mrs. Burdekin.
She made the splash of the night (as far as color
went) in vivid cornflower blue —a gossamer blue,
gleaming with moonlight-on-the-Danube sparkles,
over a snowy satin ground. The smart dame
comported herself starchily in the singular garb.
Miss Ivy Clarke was a debutante. The prettiest
of the white flock was a sweet young daughter of
Senator Robert Best. The Federalist was absent,
saying his country in the Senate, and his fair
chick had to depend on a pretty step-mommer for
agood time. But nodebutante hasa brilliant or jolly
time at a Government House ball. The frigidity
of such an affair, and the scarcity of young dancing
fry, prevents anything of the kind. The Madden
dame and her two plump offspring made a comely
brood, the dame looking like a gentle elder sister
whose pretty manners had outlived her pretty
youthfulness. Mrs. H. Payne was one of the
stateliest of fair craft in aesthetic tones of mauve.
An orchid was set upon her topmost coil. Mrs.
Urquhart flourished a diamond fender. Likewise
Mrs. George Chirnside and Mrs. Everard Browne.
Ihe Cli veden dowager and Mrs. Edward Miller
helped in the illuminating of the scene. A tall
diiughter of Prime Minister Deakin, deep in
science studies, cast a learned glance over the
whirling multitude. A daughter of pastor Bevan
had a softer eye for the polka flying. She’s a
picture girl of the ‘“Gardener’s Daughter” type.
There was no weather-complaint on Oaks Day.
The dresses, too, had space to trail. Dames with
notions and a passion for clothes, pinned their faith
to mauve tones. The Cliveden dowager was one,
Mrs. Burdekin was another. The latter rather
foolishly wore a crude violet hat with a frail lilac
frock. The chiffons consequently looked faded.
The one striking black rig of the Oaks was
flourished by Mrs. George Chirnside. Mrs.
Everard Browne, Mrs. Fred Payne, and a host of
buckrammed seniors flourished Directoire coats of
flowered brocade. Miss Shylie Blue wore a
muslin that seemed to have been fashioned for her
former plump size.
Captain Fitzpatrick was notable at many of the
shows last week. The ex-Aide, with the deter-
mined jaw, didn’t lose his girleen after all. It was
Miss Leila Armytage who shipped herself and
bandboxes to Colombo t’other day. Miss Connie

remains, and ’tis said will wed the warrior before
the Easter goose is roasted.
As soon as Toorak learnt that the grey dame of
Stonington had Captain Fitzpatrick out for a
chat and a stroll the Sabbath before the Cup, the
clan changed its mind about the chappie and fell
upon his neck with surprising enthusiasm. He
and his fluffy fiancee have been buzzing round at
all the Carnival sprees. This week the ex-official
makes tracks for Bananaland again to resume
wool interests.
Early in 1906 Gov. Reggie of this State takes a
jaunt by sea, probably to the Cold Country, iri
which case he will not hie back again. The Tal-
bottles can’t knuckle down to a Governor-General,
especially when the high, grey, blue-blooded
dame has to bend the knee to the little Northcote.
Gov. Talbot suffers from sciatica, stiff neck and
lofty notions. It hurts him to take second place.
Mr. Victor Hood comes from the jovial Le
Hunte staff, and is to take the place on the Vic.
staff of Cap. Buxton, the young man who wears
expressions and forgets to lock up his coun-
tenance, or leave his feelings at home when out
on the heel of the Governor. It seems a terrible
thing in a V.R. caddy to see an impromptu grin
breaking up his visage and surprise, or any other
feeling, on his duty face. The ideal Aide is a mere
machine —the machine of a rubber stamp.
The brightest private spree of the Carnival
was the hop given by Mrs. Fred Payne.
The gardens were dotted over with colored lights.
The house and guests beamed with illuminations.
One Sydney dame, Mrs. Noel Paton, glimmered
in green raiment and many emeralds. The hostess
herself was habited in pallid chiffons suggestive of
dawn mist, with scintillating points of golden
light. Gems of great lustre added radiance to the
toilette. More gold was added to the scene by
Mrs. Harry Payne, whose opulent chiffons,
however, were minus much gem glory—the stolen
diamonds being not yet replaced. Mrs. Burdekin
was mildly garbed in cerulean blue with a sky-
like spread save where cloudy laces broke through.
All the aides from both Government Houses gave
an official tone to the proceedings.
The one Toorak lawn party of the carnival was
given by Mrs. C. Armytage, when “Como” flew the
festive flag. A Sydney flock were to the fore, Mrs.
Philip Morton most prominent.
The Deakin lawn spree was almost limited to
Parliamentarians, and they're the worst in the
world at flaunting bravely in the butterfly fashion.
With the G.-G. troop came the Earl of the ruddy
side-whiskers, and the Governor from the Apple
Isle nearly burst his vest buttons in an effort to
address everyone he remembered. Mrs. Deakin
was garbed in arsenic green taffeta, with
the same hue repeated in her toque. The
one languorous trailer was Mrs. Isaacs, who
has recently been licking her studious spouse into
social shape. He’s coming round to the ways of
frill and folly nicely. She wore a cream lace frock
with girly sash-ends of satin, and blush pink head-
gear.
There was a rush of the best dresses for the
Steeplechase. The G.-G. dame was once more
Joyously garbed—this time in faint champagne
pink and peach tones, all glimmering softly over
her neat form. The rest of the party looked dull
and frumpish. Mrs. Everard Browne, who has
been wearing the most expensive clothes of all the
she-sports of this Carnival, was in a regular ball-
room rig of white silk clouded with net, the net
being broken up by strips of sky blue satin. A
pink hat of the gayest Carnival order went
with this. In general, hats and clothes ran
greatly to cinnamon and burnt onion tones.
Miss Ethel Guthrie, fresh from a trip abroad,
pinned her millinery hopes to a Romney
shape, flying a wonderful feather of those
hues. Miss Hose Musgrove did likewise. Miss
Maud Amber, of Travesty Stars recollection, was
a joy to behold in a whole outfit of cinnamon and
burnt onion chiffons, cut to give every chance of
display to her curves.
A point about the Cup junkets was the failure
of all the Tooraketty to shine. Not one of the
Society charmers got within coo-ee of the first
nxnk of competitors. Lauded girleens like the
Misses Madden, Fair bairn, Oliver, and Anderson
were nowhere. Frisky dames left them in the
ruck of the clothes-horse race.
The thousands travelling out to “Stonington”
the other Monday for a strawberry crush cursed
the distance they had to cover to get there. A
start was made by many before breakfast, and
they landed, tired, hot, and nerve-shaken, just in
time to grasp the paw of the Vice-Regals before
they left off hand-shaking. The motor gang mostly
arrived in hot house machines, from which they
issued foith minus dust and road debris, but plus
many degrees of warmth. The summer motorist
recognises that she has either to swallow several
pounds of circulating earth, or steam within the
glass covers, bhe mostly prefers the steaming.
However, the crush was a chance for airing fine
dresses. The vice-regal dame herself was garbed
m bereavement silk, the dull kind out of which
the tears have washed all lustre. In the high
funereal hat a funereal feather stretched its solemn
length like the long arm of coincidence. When
the greater Exes, and their following landed on
the reception mat, the hosts gave up shaking the
hand of the multitude and trotted off to the tent of
plenty. For once Lady Northcote left off gor-
geous trimmings and contented herself with a
simple peach-pink taffeta, with tinted lace in
frescoes about the top tier and flounces making a
minor fuss about the skirt. Lady Edeline Strick-
land was the one indifferent dresser of the show
She was a mere blue dab. Her blonde attractions
went to waste that day.
The _ most considerable Sydney dasher at
Stonington ’ was Mrs. Spencer Brunton. And
she’s a heavy-weight dasher. Her billowing
chiffons were strewn with gauzy La France roses.
Mrs. Burdekin and Mrs. Philip Morton were a
pastel pair, the pallor of the second being accen-
tuated by the faint aesthetic tones of her toilet.
But for pallor and chiffon elegance Mrs. George
(Jhirnside took the biscuit. The only objection to
her lovely lines was a porcupine ruffle of angry
tulle. This spikey neck ornamentation spoilt the
fur dame’s garb. Mrs. Harry Payne displayed her
marvellous curves and rigid back-line in one of
the lace creations of the day. It was a heavy
Irish guipure over a glace silk. The wearer ap-
peared to have been moulded for the garb, not the
garb for her., Among the grey dames, the figure
and cream raiment of Mrs. Herbert Power were
subject for most note. Those senior dames boast
the dress coquetries and the curves of sweet
seventeen. The men were disturbed as to the
matter of clothes. The beaver-lidded, tail-coated
variety were in the majority, the sac-suited straw-
thatched specimens in the minority. Archbishop
Garr wore his full skirts. As he moved heavily
along, his flock shyly saluted him, some bowing
their crested tops over the kissing signet, others
giving a kind of mixed bob and salaam. The
Gravan Duffys are generally quoted for doing the
correct sort of thing in the way of a Holy
Homan salute.
The tobacconists who, in the first flush of
Federal matters, packed up midget snap-shots of
members of Parliament in their cheap cigarette
packets have found the scheme a failure. The
people who patronise cheap cigarettes expect to
get a bust view of Tottie Fewclothes, and would
find a photo of Julius Cassar, M.P., or Senator
Napoleon, a bore. The street-urchin pitches the
politician snap-shot at his enemy, the Dago of the
banana barrow, and snorts out his disgust.
The jaunty canes which the V.R. caddies air
with their blue-and-red regimentals seem an in-
congruity. A Tommy Dodd stick in conjunction
with a bloodthirsty uniform is as ludicrous as a
fragile sprig of forget-me-not in the coat of a
porky politician.
At the most swagger lawn-spree of the season
a Toorak dame of great wealth and hostly pro-
minence, sat dazed from the effects of over-much
omelette or turtle-soup at lunch. Anyhow, some-
thing at tiffin time had played up with her equi-
librium. It often does. The hands extended to
her by unwary pals dropped back unshaken, and
nought but an inane smile met the how-do glances
of greeters.
Toorak is so tired of seeing one giddy couple in
the shackles of an engagement that it prays for a
speedy marriage, when there’ll be once more a
chance of finding the pair apart. Marriage has a
great power for lengthening the tether of love.
Some matrons’ notion of selling tickets for a
charity hop and then behaving as if they were
private hostesses, has annoyed the dancing con-
tingent who turned up at a recent frolic. There
were two supper rooms—one for th© swagger ele-
ment and the other for the grpat. unleavened.
In the latter the champagne ran 1 out. Then the
indignant ran home.
The Federal Turners are on their way back
from Monkey-land. They touch Brisbane this
week. Advices to hand state that 'the ex-
Treasurer is feeling fit and hearty, and she is
more strenuous than ever.
Mrs. W. Williams—daughter of the late Mr.
Pat. M‘Caughan—has been shining of late as one
of the frilliest of young dames. She dresses like
a Parisienne who knows a thing or two.
Miss Agnes Goodsir is back from extensive
brush-work in Continental centres, and has
some works on show just now. The inter-
esting artiste is a daughter of a prominent
Customs official. Some welcome homes have been
keeping the painter in festive mood.
One of the showiest promenaders at the Flem-
ing^oll Grand Strut has been Mrs. S. Josephson,
of Sydney. Her black and rose chiffons at the
Cup were eye-splitting in their gorgeousness.
Surgeon O’Hara and his pleasant dame wind up
the whirligig with an afternoon spree on Wednes-
day (15th). The O’Hara hospitalities are usually
jolly affairs, with a streak of Bohemia in the pro-
ceedings.
Miss Irene Marks landed at the Grand on Cup
day looking, so report says, as cool as a lemon
blanc-mange. The Madden girls called in to see
the traveller, and bore her off in the evening to
“ Paul Jones.” Next day a shoal of flatterers saw
her off by express to the Holy City.
Yours Affectionately,
TRYPHENA.
“Yarrum”: It was Trafalgar Day. I
hiked at a break-neck pace between Charlestown
and the lake to catch a boat to Toronto. Managed
to scramble on board just as she was putting off.
Was hot and irritable, and the noise of many
beery revellers didn’t tend to allay my troubles.
I wanted to think about Nelson and Trafalgar,
but couldn’t. An ancient rum-cask squatted itself
beside me, and asked me to drink schnapps—
never could stand schnapps—from a teacup with
much, froth about it. He said it was a day for
rejoicing. My loyalty wouldn’t stand the strain,
and I refused to imbibe. Then the cask started
to regard me suspiciously, and a bandy-legged
Geordie said I must be a pro-Boer. Later on,
the old prevaricator informed me that his father
had fought side by side with Nelson, who wouldn’t
remove his medals, although the old man had
begged of him to do so. Also, the old man had
heard Horatio bequeath Lady Hamilton to his
country, and had helped Hardy to carry him
below. The old humbug was regarded as some-
body uncommon by the yokels about him ; and no
doubt that fact accounted for his advanced stage
of intoxication. At Toronto that night I took
much whisky from a clean vessel. I felt it was
up to me. Last I can remember was a Dago
fisherman murdering “The Death of Nelson”
through his nose.
Vic. Premier Bent’s closer settlement policy
proceeds unsatisfactorily. The first estate cut up
and offered—SpringVale—consisted of 20 farms, of
which six are still unapplied for ; of the 47 blocks
in Memsie, 10 are so far ownerless ; while of the
53 in the stony Overnewton Estate only 31 went
off, leaving 5400 out of the whole 9200 acres in the
Board’s hands. It has now dawned on the said
Board that something is wrong with the works—it
apparently hasn’t the least idea what—so it isn’t
going to offer Wyuna or Strathkellar “until
harvesting operations are over.” What “harvest-
ing operations” have to do with the man who
wants land, but hasn’t any to reap a harvest from,
Heaven only knows. But the Board has to earn
its wages in the way provided by Bent, and Bent’s
Act didn’t provide for compulsory purchase on
ftiir terms of first-class land near a market; nor
has Bent any apparent intention of imposing a
land-tax to force the big land monopolists to closer
settle their own estates.
It is generally thought that there is no
cure for stoutness, because the usual treatments

have been printed in Sydney. You’ll see the
great injustice this is to Mullumbimby. I’ve
therefore called a meeting of our progress com-
mittee, and given notice that I shall move—
“ That the attention of Senior-Constable Smith
be drawn to the serious and unconstitutional act
of the Government in having the postage-stamps
for Mullumbimby printed in Sydney.” Ned
Smithers has also given notice that he will move
that- the Senior - Constable’s attention be
drawn to the serious and unconstitutional action
of Carruthers in having all our dog-tax forms
printed anywhere but in Mullumbimby. (P.S.—
I am informed that the same infamy is practised
with regard to Gobarralong, Pampoolah, Puddle-
dock, Knockrow, and Milparinka. This sort of
thing must stop, or we shall separate.)
T’other day, Sydney daily papers (fired by
Dill Macky and Woolls-Rutledge) were be-
spattered with indignation at the audacity of the
Federal Parliament when it passed a resolution re
Home Rule for Ireland, and suggestions were
heaved about that the British Parliament ought
to tell the Australian ditto to keep its own door-
step bright and shiny without dabbling in the
government of other parts of the Empire. The
question looked so simple that even the N.S.W.
Legislative Council woke up sufficiently to
mumble something about it, but when a
Councillor asked what the talk was about
no one seemed to know, and dreariness o’erspread
the Chamber of Toddlers once more. The
gist of the rumpus was that Australia should
mind its own affairs, and allow other people to
mind their personal troubles. But the excellent
suggestion was still hot when Premier Carruthers
decided to join with the other State Parliaments
in asking the Australian Government to poke its
nose into Russian affairs, by “ forwarding a strong
remonstrance to the Imperial Government against
Russia’s Jewish atrocities

The Objective.
E n eXact i S1 j e T of tlie riffc the ranks of
' Lal ? or Party is a thing that is
moult to estimate, but, whether it prove large or
small, one thing seems certain—that purposeless
and unornamental article called the “ objective ”
is partly responsible. Considering the uselessness
of the objective it is a pity that this incentive to
n not a ' to ? et T he r dropped. The programme
of the Queensland Labor party sets forth the first
halt ot its ultimate aim, or target, or zenith, or
apex, or culmination, to be
nroHnopr^w 6^ 111 re ?, ulfcs of their industry to the wealth
ES by .the collective ownership of the means of
thrn, /h distribution, and exchange, to be attained
fnnptinna if' X at n ? 10n ? f tlle industrial and economic
functions of the State and local governing bodies.
The party then lays down a list of measures—in
e main most valuable and essential measures—
which are expected to lead up to this result. They
may lead there or they may not; many things
don t lead where people imagine they will;
anyhow they won t lead there this session or
next or the one after that—probably not this
generation—and at present the essential is to pass
the measures. They are for the present; the
objective is, for the future. But meajiwhile
the objective ” looks very vague and alarming
to many mild, ordinary people, and by publishing
it, and declaring that simple business-like pro-
positions such as the abolition of the useless
otate Governor, the progressive land-tax and
income-tax, the establishment of a Public Trust
State Liquor Monopoly, and the Public
i)ebt Sinking Fund—are expected and intended to
lead up to it, the party really warns these people not
to vote for the aforesaid business-like propositions.
It may be honest to tell the whole story in
advance, and to play the game with the cards on
the table, but it is a useless and unprofitable kind
u honesty. If the Labor party said nothing
about its “ objective it might think about
it as much as it liked—and simply plodded
on, securing _ one item after another of its
programme, it would gain support as it
progressed. After it had secured a dozen or more
of its reforms, and shown that, instead of the
country being ruined by them, it was all the better
and all the richer, many of the timid souls who
are now scared to death by the “objective” would
probably hear of it without turning aiiair. Again,
if the party were not. so visibly chained up to its
objective, ’ and didn’t make its acceptance so
bdter a dogma, it might secure the support of many
politicians who are ready to subscribe to all, or
much of, the platform, and only draw the line at
the nature of the alleged millennium which is to
follow. There is no reason why it shouldn’t use
these politicians as it goes along. They will pro-
bably be dead in any case before the “objective ”
is arrived at. The Democratic party which
has achieved most success—that of Maoriland—
started without any declared “objective.” It
i dn u * n vance where it was going, and
thereby alarm timid souls about the length
of the road and the startling character of the
destination. It just went, and now it is nearer
to arriving than most parties. The “objective”
is not only the most useless item of the Labor
party s luggage; it is also the chief weapon of the
party’s enemies. On it they hang their loudest
and most plausible shrieks about “confiscation,”
‘Socialism,” and “revolution.” And when the
Labor party is revising its programme, tlie worst
difficulty and the nearest approach to internal
breakage is generally over the “objective.” In
fact, the Queensland State Labor party and the
Federal Labor party have already divided on the
point. The struggle to define this Mecca or El
Dorado or New Jerusalem at which the party
hopes to arrive in the dim, remote future, is a
very great struggle at times, and the New Jeru-
salem, when it is defined, does no real good. Also
it helps to divert the party’s own attention
from matters of immediate concern. It is
just a millennium—as vague and of as little
immediate purpose. If the party must have
an “ objective ” it should appoint a trusted
committee of one to draft it and write it
out, and then let him put it in an iron box, and
bury it deep in his back yard, and say nothing
about it. And meanwhile the party should de-
vote itself to deciding on the measures it wants,
and when they have been all secured it should dig
up the “objective ” and look at it. Solomon, who
was occasionally threatened with brains, said
something about an individual who told all his
mind. And his son Rehoboam, who was never in
danger of brains, told all his mind in one act, and
lost five-sixths of a kingdom right there, and had
his rate*collector killed into the bargain.

At one time The Bulletin was, in its advo-
cacy of a White Australia, pretty well *‘A voice cry-
ing in the wilderness scarcely any other import-
ant weekly or daily paper supported the principle
m its entirety. Nowadays, however, the tide has
turned, and even the London papers are being
converted. London Times gives the policy its
tardy, but hearty endorsement, declaring that
It is certain that an absolute laissez fairs policy as
regards colored immigrants would make Australia the
home of a preponderating yellow-brown population.
The Outlook, one of the sanest and most thought-
ful of the English weeklies, printed this lately :
All Australians are agreed in accepting the root
principles of the white Australia policy, which, with its
eccentricities expunged, and logically developed under the
present Prime Minister, will make for the safeguarding of
Imperial interests in the Pacific. There can be no doubt
whatever that_Australia, and also British Columbia, are
wise in excluding Asiatic labor, even of the best type.
As regards the present position of the
Federal capital question :
The people of N.S.W. accepted the Federal Constitu-
tion by a solid majority when there was in it no stipula-
tion at all about where the capital should be. But their
vote was annulled in advance by the State Parliament
N.S.W. had invited the other States to come into the
movement, and its Parliament agreed that the Federal
Constitution should be accepted if a majority of the
people voted for it, and if that majority mustered at
least 50,000. votes. The other States adhered to their share
of the agreement; the N.S.W. Parliament broke its
pledge by raising the minimum to 80,000 votes. It was
the one Parliament which couldn’t keep faith—a Parlia-
ment of mean traitors, of promise-breakers, of sneaks and
shufflers, of repudiationists, dodgers and backers-out.
When it had annulled the popular vote in acceptance of
the Bill it was agreed, without reference to the
people, that there should be a fresh deal on
the understanding that the capital should be in
N.S.W., not less than 100 miles from Sydney, and
should consist of an area of i\t less than 100
square miles. Now a section at least of the N.S.W.
Parliament seeks to again break the agreement, and is
the same old faithless, lying, shuffling disgrace. It again
wants to alter the bargain, and to insert variations. One
variation it demands is that the capital shall be close to
the 100-mile limit from Sydney, which is not in the
agreement. Another is that it shall not be much over
the minimum of 100 square miles, which also is not in the
agreement. A third is that N.S.W. shall have a voice
apart from the voice of its Federal members, in fixing the
site of the capital, which, again, is not in the agreement
As before, the N.S.W. Parliament is the one Legislature
m Australia which can’t keep faith—the one Legislature
whose solemn undertaking is of no more value than
Wilkins Micawber’s P.N. or Caesar Borgia’s oath. Under
the circumstances, if N.S.W. isn’t ashamed of its miser-
able State Parliament it can only be because it and its
Parliament are a pair, and a very bad pair.


POLITICAL
POINTS
N.S. Wales put up another record in the
past year (to June 30); for the first time its State
interest bill got past £3,000,000.
They are now beginning to talk in Victoria
about the “Brick Works Scandal,” and there is a
heaving of the surface as if some buried accu-
sation was trying to get out of its grave and have
a word with somebody.
S.A. Premier Price, finding that the Rail-
way Department was called upon to pay too high
a price for its ice, has resolved to start a State
ice factory. It will be a handy place for the in-
furiated Tory, red hot with anger at Labor
legislation, to drop into for a cool down.
The Tasmanian Assembly has just thrown
out, as violent and revolutionary, a Bill providing
for a proper audit of the accounts of friendly
societies, so as to make sure that the members
shall get the benefits they pay for. It is hard to
guess what wouldn’t be regarded as revolutionary
in Tasmania.
Premier Seddon, of Maoriland, has a
scheme on hand whereby an old age pension shall
be payable to every aged inhabitant if he likes to
claim it, regardless of his wealth or poverty.
Denmark, where the old age pension commenced,
works on that basis, so there is a good sound
precedent to go upon if one should be required.
Prime Minister Deakin again decides that
there won’t be time to pass the High Commis-
sioner Bill and appoint a High Commissioner this
session. And unless Deakin gets a set of stand-
ing orders that will quell obstruction, and a lower
jaw more like the cow-catcher of a locomotive,
he never will have time for anything of impor-
tance.
That Australian slanderer, Tozer, has been
at it again. The other day he had the audacity
to wire to Premier Morgan, suggesting that the
new State Governor, Lord Chelmsford, was in a
difficulty about getting his retinue past the
Customs when they reached Australia. The reply
was one which even a rhinoceros like Tozer will
recollect for a day or two.
Arthur Griffith made a sensible suggestion
in N.S.W. State Parliament last week that, instead
of spending a huge sum of borrowed money in
constructing anew library building, the Go vernmen t
should utilise Government House for the purpose.
Government House is now used, on an average, a
month or two per annum, and just now N.S.W.
has three Government Houses empty —at Sydney,
Rose Bay and Moss Vale.
Apropos of the “Belata” belting case
evidence, it is a curious fact that, whilst the
Freetrader is always howling about the “lob-
bying ” of Protectionist manufacturers, such
lobbying has never, to The Bulletin’s know-
ledge, been sworn to in a court of law; but the
Freetrader is constantly being shown up in the
witness-box as a person who employs agents to
“ work ” members of Parliament to secure reduc-
tion or abolition of duties with a view to the
destruction of Australian industries.
In the face of keen competition, old John
Warren, M.L.C., achieved the record for absolute
puerility in the debate on the Shearers’ Accommo-
dation Bill recently before the S.A. House of
Fossils. As a last despairing effort, Warren said
that most of the shearers lived in very small
dwellings, and the increased breathing space
provided under the Bill would cause them to
catch colds and snuffle. And you must have a
special property qualification before you can vote
for great men like John Warren in S.A. !
“ Caucus ” from Westralia :
I was not surprised at ex-Prenrier Daglish ratting from
the Labor ranks. He never was a Labor man at heart.
In South Melbourne, some years ago (Daglish and Bent
lost their deposits at the same election), he was opposed
to the Labor cause. When he moved to Westralia he was
still an opponent and tried to prevent a labor league being
formed in Subiaco suburb, which, later on, he represented
as a pledged Labor member. His secrecy, his want of
confidence in his colleagues, his inability to grasp facts,
and his general unfitness as leader were the main causes
of the wreck of the Labor Ministry.
The fact that 11 contractors are on trial at
New York for importing English workmen under
contract will perhaps at last make Bruce Smith
leave off deceiving audiences of credulous females
with his oft-told tale about how the United States
opens its doors to all comers.' There is ri. line
beyond which even a politician shouldn’t go
m the way of misrepresentation, and misrepre-
sentation which consists of the bald statement
that the thing is what isn’t is a crude affair. Any
pushite or domain loafer is equal to that kind of
diplomacy.
The stand made by Prime Minister Deakin
in “refusing to adjourn the National Parliament
for a horse-race, ” and thus forcing the House to
sit on the afternoon of Cup Day, would have had
some, value if the obstructives of the Opposition
hadn’t taken rip nearly the whole of the afternoon
before Cup Day in discussing whether they ri'ould
Sit on Cup afternoon. What is wanted is riot
overtime or extended hours so much as a method
of getting some strenuous, useful work done
within ordinary working hours. And Deakin is
too affable.
Answering Williemotor Kelly in the House
pf Reps, last week, Minister Eyving stated that
the Government was favorable to locally-owried

Apropos of the bitter, bitter wail ,of N.S.W.
treipier Carruthers because the Australian Govern-
ment proposes to print its stamps at Adelaide (it
must print them somewhere, and it finds that Ade-
laide does the cheapest stamp-printing in Austra-
lia)—it only seems like yesterday when Carruthers
was fighting tooth-and-nail to get the building of
60 N.S.W. locomotives done in the U.S. for the
sake of cheapness. According to Carruthers,
therefore, it is right to take a very large job from
Sydney and give it to America, but it is a cause
for rage and cursing and secession to give a small
job to South Australia. As already mentioned,
the stamp-printing business must be concentrated
somewhere for the sake of economy. Queensland,
Victoria, Tasmania and W.A." will lose their little
job just as N.S.W. will, but it is only N.S.W.—
the spoilt infant of the Commonwealth—that is
blubbering.
A MATTER OF NO IMPORTANCE.
T HE BOSS (to applicant for position as office boy): “ Well, and what's your name!"
CHEERFUL YOUTH (airily): “ Don't let that worry yer, boss. Call me Bosker.”

Thus Prime Minister Deakin :
If we pay more for our loans, if we get fewer people
who emigrate from the Mother country than we ought to
get, if our progress is less than it should be, it is largely
due to the malignant falsehoods of those who call them-
selves Australians in Australian newspapers.
Which is excellent English, and quite true so far
as it goes. But if Deakin would give up politely
bowing and scraping over the landscape and Do
Things, he could smother the Stinking Fish party.
When a Government is only going to do some-
thing, that something will serve for years as a
Stinking Fish argument about the ruin that is
bound to follow on Socialistic legislation. When
it does the thing—does it well and proves it bene-
ficial instead of injurious—then panting Fish
stinks after it in vain.
Two paragraphs from an article headed
“Employees That Pay,” in S.M. Hf.rat.d :
To get good work and give good wages shows level-
headedness. To get good work and give little or no
wages shows talent. To get good work and handsome
profits in exchange shows genius.
Mr. Suttor, the Commercial Agent for the East, now
suggests that Japanese students (for whose names and
position he will vouch) be sent to Australia to learn wool-
classing and kindred subjects. They would sort out wool
and do other “dirty work,” and pay well. It is a splen-
did idea.
With Kanaka cane-cuttera and mill workers,
Afghan and Syrian carriers, Chinese cooks, gar-
deners and boundary-riders, Red Indian stock-
men, Jap wool classers and shearers, nigger
vignerons and fishermen, Booth’s scum for agri-
culturists, coolie miners, and the riffraff of the
earth for general rouseabouts, this misgoverned
country would begin to approach somewhat to the
ideal of the capitalistic minority. What their
own white countrymen—the men who blazed the
track —would do doesn’t matter. Yet, if the cap-
able Jap persons offered to edit and sub-edit and
report the S.M. Herald for nothing, and the
editor, who thinks it a “splendid idea ” when his
poorer fellow countryman loses his job, lost his
own job, he would probably cry out in quite a dif-
ferent key.
From S.M. Herald’s “ Woman’s Page ”
(8/11/ 05),
Sons of Japanese gentlemen are sent to Townsville (Q.)
in number? to learn the English language. ,To support
themselves, they x take positions as cooks, waiters, and
domestic servants.
If this is true, what have the Immigration autho-
rities to say about it ? The Immigration Restric-
tion Act certainly never contemplated the admis-
sion into the Commonwealth of numbers of the
“sons of Japanese gentlemen” to take positions
as cooks, &e. —and incidentally to do white cooks
out of their billets.
Premier Seddon, of Maoriland, is re-
Eorted to be babbling in his old age about “ a free
reakfast table ” —a gag that did a lot of service
in England a good many years ago. Heaven
only knows why there should be any more points
about a free breakfast table thari a free dinner
table, or tea-fable, or dressing-table, but the
phrase caught on till it became a sort of gospel.
And in their declining years Seddon rind the
Other aged object seem to have met and gone into
the lorig-ldst brother business.
Preniier Bent’s attention has just been drawn
to the fact that four members of the Yic. House
of Rich Landlords, directors or shareholders of the
Melbourne Tramway Co. rind thus personally and
pecuniarily interested, \ cited for the airiendmeni
to the Railway Motor Buses Bill, providing that
said buses shall not ply for hire on trami routes. Of
course the motives of the four may have been
perfectly pure and statesmanlike, and entirely in
the interests of the citizens they represent, but it
is unfortunate all the same that there seems to be
no provision in the Amended Constitution Act or
ariy cither Act to deal with them:
Another Australian is beirig
ruined, according to the daily papers ; the Immi-
gration Restriction Act is said to have driven
away 125 pearling boats from Thursday Island to
the Straits in the last two years. An Australian
industry ! It will make those smile who know.
Practically, it didn’t employ one Australian or
European. The discolored scum whom it did
employ spent practically nothing with Australians
or Europeans. All they' did for Australia
was to skin its best pearling grounds. The
S.M. Herald, which is shocked at this new
atrocity of Labor legislation (which, by the way,
isn’t Labor legislation at all), should be equally
shocked if a policeman stopped a party of burglars
from breaking into Mr. James’s house and having
a riot in the back-yard with the proceeds.
Again the N.S.W. farmer and pastoralist
are to be greased with a subsidy. Under Carru-
thers’ Shires Bill a farmer or squatter who pays
local rates on his land will not also be liable to pay
land-tax to the State, nor uill he have to pay
income-tax on the rents received from the land nor
on income derived from the use of the land. Yet
the manufacturer pays land-tax to the State on
the value of the ground his factory stands on,
municipal rates on the value of the ground and
building, and income-tax on the profits of his
industry. The pampered “ backbone of the coun-
try ” mustn’t be taxed twice ; it doesn’t matter in
the least if the manufacturer is taxed three times.
The ponderous British War Office has just
gut up a record for motionlessness. When the
ohen-China war commenced, some six years ago,
and the first Cohentingenter went across from
Australia to Boer-land, an application was made
that Australian officers should be allowed to
officially retain their local rank in the field. The
War Office has just published, in the London
Gazette, its consent to this request; and it prints
a score or more columns of the names of those
officers entitled to the “concession.” Against
many of the names is the remark “sincedeceased.”
Possibly the War Office isn’t yet aware, officially,
that the war is over.
The Sunshine Harvester Works have just
been forced to discharge 130 men. The American
Harvester people are selling machines so cheaply,
under the present miserably inefficient tariff, that
it is becoming impossible to compete with them.
Of course, they may lose by it for a time, but, when
the Australian industry is killed quite dead, and
all its men are thrown out of work, they will raise
the price sufficiently to make good the present
loss three times over. There will be no Australian
competition then. The U.S. has a tariff which
doesn’t allow of foreign competition, and the
Harvester people can make enough profits there
to more than cover any temporary loss incurred
while (with the assistance of our Foreign-trade
push) they are killing an Australian industry.
British politicians, &c., as described by
Melbourne Age’s London correspondent:—
, They are content to remain densely ignorant of the
actual state of affairs in Australia, Maoriland, and the
Pacific, and few of them have ever been as far as the; Cape
or Canada. Some of these are the men who still accept
the Freetrader, Sir Charles Dilke, as a colonial authority,
on the strength of a book that he wrote some sixteen
years ago. Sir Gilbert Parker is another of their instruc-
tors. A third oracle who influences many of them
through the leading columns of a Freetrade morning
paper—often to the disadvantage of Australia—has never
been outside England in his life, except for a few summer
holidays on the other side of the Channel. On colonial
questions he is one of the specialists of Fleet-street. A
couple of years ago he wrote an elaborate work on South
Africa, and did not find it necessary to go further than
Bloomsbury for his facts.
“ X.Y.Z.” : What folly is all this naval
celebration business ! When England defeated
the Sp'anish Aririada, ahd Drake, Frobisher,
Raleigh arid Co. raged over all the world’s seas;
England had only the same population that Aus-
tralia has ridw. Therefore it seems clear to me,
after studying George Reid’s speeches on the
impossibility of Australian naval defence, that
England, in those days, had no right to have rifly
riavy at ali, that it couldn’t support one, arid that
it should instead have paid a subsidy to someone
to deferid it. Why do not our school histories of
England point out that, according to Australian
policy, it was darned cheek for Drake, Frobisher
and Co. to exist at all ?
Premier Bent’s brutal outspokenness
brought him into collision with the Walhalla
(Yic.) shire councillors lately. They called him
“arrogant” and “discourteous”; also, he whs
“ a little monarch, who humiliated all who came
in contact with him.” But when Thomas
explained that these councillors had asked for
£il,odo out of the Special road grant of £15,000
without offering to piit up anything themselves i
had also asked for £lOO,OOO fdr an extension Of
the Moe-Walhalla railway; and weie illegally
using their municipal rates to pay interest to the
railway trust; the general opinion seemed to . be
that the alleged humiliation was fully warranted
arid much needed.
Treasurer Kidston’sßill, providing that the
proceeds of Queensland land auctions should go into
a Public Works Fund, met with bitter opposition
from the Socialism-in-our-Time section of the
Labor party, which complained that the idea
would encourage the jobbing away of the public
estate. But it is hard to see how there will be
more temptation to scatter land revenue that way
than the other way, and at least Kidston’s scheme
means that the State will have new assets to show
for its land-sale money. Under the old system
the land went just the same, and there was nothing
to show for it except the joy of possessing Robert
Philp. Certainly the land should not be sold, but
Queensland is between the devil and the deep sea,
and the sea is at least cooler than the devil.
There was a terrible row in Sydney last
week because a German steward, awash with
beer, strolled on board an anchored ship and
hauled down the British flag. The press was
furious, questions were asked in the Legislative
Council, the Government began to snort, and the
German Consul-General sent a hurried apology,
intimating that the miscreant was drunk at the
time and had been severely dealt with. Had he
brought in a shipload of goods and closed up a
couple of Australian factories, throwing a hundred
or two of Austral-Britons out of work, the papers
that howled for his execution would have written
about the expansion of our blessed commerce.
There’s a lot too much regard for the flag, and too
little for what the flag represents.
Said that the Jap authorities made in-
quiries of the Australian Government —during
Reid’s term of office—as to the terms on which
Jap doctors would be admitted to practice in the
Commonwealth. The Medical Boards of the
various States were communicated with on the
subject, but the Reid Ministry collapsed before
any action was taken. It would be interesting to
know whether the present Government has come
across the papers dealing with the matter. The
Bulletin has its doubts about doctors, but it
thinks that Japanese barristers and daily paper
editors should be encouraged to come here. The
Argus with a cheap Jap editor and a briefless
Bruce Smith manfully facing Jap competition
would be too beautiful for words.
S.A. Legislative Council has contemp-
tuously disregarded the verdict of the great
majority of the people at the last general election,
and thrown out the Constitutional Reform Bills.
Premier Price, anxious for rest and recess, does
not want, it is said, to fight, but Labor Leader
Archibald is urging him to take up a definite
stand. Still, with an immovable Council, what is
a definite stand, and how do you take it up?
Unless the Assembly is prepared to stop supplies,
and put the whole Government machine on strike
till the Council climbs down (and that is what it
should do) a stand is of little value. It may be
something to put a hot teapot on, or it may mean
a street corner where you sell bootlaces, but all
these things are vanity.
A whole lot of people lately awoke to a
sense of the sinfulness of a State establishing a
fund to do its own fire-insuring ; and Eat fumed
that it was a rotten idea from a business point of
view and a gross interference with Private Enter-
prise. Carruthers had hardly crumpled up as
usual, abolished the insurance fund, and collared
the accumulated premiums, when the Mt. Lyell
Co., one of the representative Eat institutions of
the Commonwealth, announced that it had decided
to do the very thing that the State had aban-
doned :
In view of the high premiums which the Fire Under-
writers’ Association has fixed for the co.’s Yarraville
Chemical Works, and considering the manner in which
the risks are spread over a large area, your directors have
resolved to do the whole of the co.’s fire underwriting.
It has therefore been decided to form a Fire Insurance
Fund.
So Bill Knox, M.H.R., Bowes Kelly, and others
of the Fattest of the Fat do the very thing that
poor, half-baked Carruthers was scared avvay from,
because somebody (with his own fire-insurance
scrip up his sleeve) told him that no business man
would think of doing it.

SPORTING NOTIONS
Melbourne last week was strewn with the frag-
ments of shattered Oup dreams. The dreams were more
circumstantial than usual, and in two or three cases they
involved the death of the dreamer prior to the race, with
the result that the sorrowing relatives of the deceased
felt very confident about “ landing the double.” A
butcher, living down at Brighton (Melb.), had a dream
which admitted of profitable interpretation. He saw a
number of different animals running for the Cup—a sort
of go-as-you-please menagerie race. The animal that
came in first was a bullock —as might be expected in a
butcher’s dream —so he put £5 on Blue Spec because
F. Bullock was riding it.
* * * *
Fair to assume that Tom Payten’s pair of Oup
candidates —Scot Free and Elvo—might have finished first
and third but for their 71b. penalties. Scot Free didn’t
get a 71b. beating from Blue Spec, nor was Elvo far be-
hind Tartan. Turning into the straight the mare was
running about fourth to Scot Free and Fabric after a big
effort to get clear of the ruck. Under the circumstances
she must have been much troubled by the extra 71b.
* ■» * *
The backers of Blue Spec couldn’t show much
cause for their triumphant “ What did I tell you ! ” after
the race. Blue Spec got away better than most of them,
and being a naturally wary or “ handy ” horse in a big
field he was never in a bad place. He has the necessary
stamina, and he outstayed Scot Free. But it wasn’t
a brilliant win from a strong opposition. As for his pre-
vious victory in the Moonee Valley Cup, there was the
fact that Aurate, who finished third, had also run im-
pressively, and when Aurate, a week later, was seen to be
so short of condition that he couldn’t win the Hothani
Handicap with the minimum weight, the “form” of
Blue Spec looked very moderate. It was his staying
power in a very fast run two miles that enabled him to
carry Bst in front of an exceptionally poor field. Not a
high-class three-year-old in the crowd. Among the older
horses, two of the fastest—Marvel Loch and Glad-
some —have failed to keep the steam going over a
longer distance than 12 furlongs. Tartan (9st) was
a Sydney Cup winner, to be sure, but he carried only
7.12 when he won the Cup from the moderate Tatter-
demalion. Warroo might be equal to the distance if he
were fit, but the bulky fellow was not fit on Cup day.
And Maniopoto—the one brilliant performer in the field—
is not yet proved to be a better stayer than Marvel Loch,
though probably he could have gone two miles on the
day he won the Metropolitan. Since then the Maori-
lander has been affected by something more than a bad
cold. The boy who looks after him in the “ birdcage ”
carries a stick—a hunting crop—as though the horse
were another Emir. But if Maniopoto is not another
Emir, and his legs serve him through another couple of
seasons on the turf, he may be-confidently expected to
make very small potatoes of the horses that beat him in
the Melbourne Cup.
* • * *
“E.F.”: One gets rather tired of the languid
non-racing cynic who doesn’t believe in backing favorites
for the Melbourne Cup and always speaks of the'news-
paper tipsters as misleading oracles. Melbourne Cup for
years past has been a satisfactory race for punters who
backed not less than four or five of the shortest priced
horses at the start. These in each case were fancied,
more or less, by the llth-hour prophets. The five
favorites this year were Tartan, Scot Free, Maniopoto,
Blue Spec and Warroo. The three foremost horses came
from that little lot, and the actual winner’s price was 10
to 1. Also Fabric, the sixth favorite, finished fourth.
Last year, the winner and runner-up were fourth and fifth
favorites, and the winner, Acrasia, started at 14 to 1. In
1903 the winner, Lord Cardigan, started third favorite at
5 to 1, whilst Wakeful, the runner-up, was fourth favorite
at 12 to 1. In 1902 the two horses that beat the first
favorite were very little fancied at the start, but in 1901
the first and second favorites finished in accordance with
the betting. Punters couldn’t afford to back five horses
that year, for “ dead bird ’’ Revenue started at the short
odds of 7 to 4, and San Fran, the runner-up, was only a
4 to 1 chance. But, then, the tipsters confined their
tips to those two horses. If -the public were
to let themselves be warned against the least
likely horses, and were to form their fancies from
a combination- of haif-a-dozen different tipsters’ “lots”
on the morning of the race, they would not come to much
harm by the Melbourne Oup, taking one year with
another. It is the early backing of imaginary “good
things ” at comparatively short prices, and the late back-
ing of hopeless things at long prices which account for
ninety per cent, of the profit on Ikey Mo.’s book. After
looking through the records one is struck by the fact that
the Melbourne Cup rarely provides a remarkable “ turn-
up.” The Victory was a2sto 1 chance, but the sturdy
battler had run a good second to Wakeful for the
Melbourne Stakes three days previously'. Clean Sweep
started at 20’s, but he, like Blue Spec, had captured the
Moonee Valley Cup. For a genuine surprise we have to
go back to Tarcoola —a matter of somewhat ancient
history.
* * * *
“F.C.” : A few Cup statistics: —Of the 45 races
the first favorite has won 11, though during the last 15
years only Newhaven, Merriwee and Revenue have been
first in the betting and also first past the post. Victoria
has annexed 25 Cups, N.S.W. 17, S. Australia two, and
Westralia one—the latest. Twelve have been taken by
3-year-olds, twelve by 5-year-olds, nine by 4-year-olds,
seven by 6-year-olds, and five by old and venerable horses.
Bay horses have won 23 times, browns 14, chestnuts four,
blacks three; only once has a grey caught the judge’s
eye—Toryboy, 40 years back.
* * * *
If Lady Wallace is the “ great ” filly that some
horse reporters would make her out to be, how much
greater are the Maoriland 3-year-olds that ran away from
her at Randwick ? Her best performance thusfar was the
V.R.O. Derby win from Grama, who finished about sixth
for the Melbourne Cup with only 6.9 on his back.
* ft * *
Proceedor, winner of the Veteran Stakes at
Flemington, is said to have pulled a buggy for a while
after he had seeming-ly lost his racing pace. The buggy
treatment brought the gelding back to form again.
♦ * * *
The betting on the Flying Stakes last Thursday
was less remarkable than the fact that it escaped caustic
comment. Gladsome, although she had run less bril-
liantly than usual in the Melbourne Stakes, was neverthe-
less a good thing on paper for this w.f.a. race over seven
furlongs. Punters at the outset accepted a shade of odds,
and then, to their amazement, the mare went back in the
market until as much as 7to 1 was laid. Meanwhile, the
two-year-old Oreillet shortened to 6to 4. The race was
practically confined to Oriellet, Scotland (the outsider),
and Gladsome. Scotland chased the favorite, with Glad-
some in close attendance. The moment the outsider had .
collared the youngster Gladsome came past the pair of
them and won by a head. Whereat the public, who had
taken unaccountably liberal odds about Gladsome, were
full of joy, whilst those who had stood off the mare on
account of the extraordinary betting, could' only shake
their heads and wonder what it all meant. Gladsome
actually started at 5 to 1, Charles Stuart and Maniopoto
being backed at the same price. There was a shadow of
reason for the hope that Maniopoto would improve on
his recent performances, but the idea of Charles Stuart
(Bst.) beating even a deteriorated Gladsoihe (8.11) seemed
clearly preposterous except on the supposition that the
mare was not a goer. Last year odds of 7to 4 were laid
on Gladsome for the same race, and she won easily from
Sylvanite, the penalised Derby winner.
Aurate’s performance in the V.R.O. Handicap
was nothing to blow about —he made slow time with a
light weight—but it was enough, and it bore out Tiib
Bulletin's prediction that the son of Auraria would be
sufficiently forward in condition to win a handicap at the
end of the meeting. In excuse for Blue Spec and Boabdil,
the first and second favorites, they were said to have got
shut in against the rails coming down the straight. The
success of either gee would have been mortifying to the
other one’s jockey, for Bullock, who landed Blue Spec a
winner in the Melbourne Cup, was now riding Boabdil,
whilst Norn,an Godby got the show on Blue Spec.
* * * *
The luckiest winner at the Cup meeting was
Grama. The colt’s owner captured the Carnival Handi-
cap on a protest against Jargoon, Whose swerving across
the course had probably prevented F.J.A. from beating
the pair of them. But seeing that Grama finished second
to the swerver, and had done nothing to deserve dis-
qualification, a protest from F.J.A., the real sufferer, was
out of the question. As often as not the runner-up that
fairly gets a race on a protest looked likely to have been
beaten by the third horse if there had been no inter-
ference. In these cases there is no sporting reason why
the stewards shouldn’t order the race to be run off by the
two that were interfered with.
* * * *
At the initial meeting of the Kauri Stump Race
Club the local Maori chief acted as judge. He arrived
resplendent in a silk hat, frock coat, and red tie. The
course, marked .out with sticks, was a very small one,
and the only intimation of the finish that the jockeys had
was by the ringing of a bell as they entered the straight.
The following- conversation was overheard between judge
and steward as the horses entered the straight after
several times round: “Who in de flout now?”
“ Pakeha ” (white man). “ Lound agen.” Then as they
entered again after completing another round, “ Who in
deflontnow?” “Maori.” “Ling de bell.”
•* * * *
Saturday last was a day of some importance in
N.S.W. On the Hunter River, Arthur Towns and George
Ford were rowing for £2OO a-side ; at Sydney Cricket
Ground, the Australasian Athletic Championships meet-
ing was in full blast; and in the evening the same locality
saw some desperate cycle racing in the final of the Orient
Plate Scratch Mile, and a fine sprint at the close of the
Five Miles. . There were other things, but these were the
most important- and frilly.
* * * *
The Ford-Towns race was a well-patronised
affair, but so large a proportion of the spectators were
along the banks that the scullers must have been moved
to tears. The attendance on the official steamers was
meagre. Towns, wearing a light blue cap and dark blue
jersey, won the toss from Ford, who was in red and white
stripes, and took the windward side. The race was over
what is known as the Raymond Terrace course,
a straight stretch of water, 3J miles long. The
breeze blew dead behind the scullers. It took some
time to effect a start, and then they got away well
together at 37 to the minute. Roars, yells and
exact instructions how to win the race were shouted by
the crowd on the banks as Ford, after 200 yd., went to
the front. For three-quarters of a mile Ford led the way,
pulling the faster stroke, and then it was seen that
Towns was the stronger. With a slower stroke lie over-
took and passed Ford, and at the end of the mile was a
length and a half in front. Ford spurted desperately, but
Towns drew away every time, and in the end won easily
by six lengths. Had he put his ears back he could have
won by twice that distance. It was a most decisive
defeat. Now the old rowing hands are saying that
Arthur Towns is the coming champion.

South Tasmania comfortably defeated the
Northern team, in the Tasmanian eight-oar struggle,
recently on the Derwent River, and demonstrated the
fact that it isn’t always brawn which succeeds at sport.
The Souths’ average weight was list sJlb, while the
Norths averaged list 121 b.
* * * *
Stanbury’s efforts to clinch a championship race
with Durnan have failed; the Canadian stays at Torontoand
issues challenges which he should know nobody will accept.
Towns’ deposit is still bearing no interest while waiting
for a return tussle with the champion ; but no doubt
Stanbury will agree to race the much disappointed Towns
very'- shortly. The trouble seems to be that Stanbury and
Towns are so very much ahead of the other scullers that
struggles for the title will be but periodical matches
between the two—until the old-age pension damps their
ardor.

But for the fact that there was rheumatism in
the air this scribe would have got drunk on Saturday
night. For the first time he saw Australian bike riders
at Sydney Cricket Ground conceding haughty Americans
a start, and the spectacle of Floyd MacFarland, the
Handicap King, receiving 15 .yards in half-a-miie from
Australians broke him up altogether. Also, it broke up
MacFarland, and he scratched rather than submit to the
indignity.
* ir
The two semi-finals and the final of the Orient
Plate were wildly exciting. The Orient Plate is a paced
mile scratch event. In the first heat Pye made a
phenomenal bound, which left G. H. Horder and
MacFarland nearly a length behind, fighting a desperate
whirling match for the second place. The second heat of
the semi-final found the riders disinclined to take the
pace, and the men were recalled and started again with
cautions. But they' loafed again till Meg-son, seeing- bis
chance, dashed away, and got a 30yd. break. Lemon,
the pacer, lay right down to it, and kicked out so
vigorously that he brought the field up with the erst-
while champion. At the scoring board Goulburn Brook
rushed to the front ; Olarke and Walker came at
him, but he broke away again, and finished
with a length to spare. Lemon’s great dash after
Megson had cut down the time, and the mile
was covered in lmin. 59sec., the last 220 yd. being done in
12see., the fastest sprint of the season. The final was
slower, but, nevertheless, more exciting. After the bell,
Brook flashed past MacFarland, Pye, and Walker, and
went for a great three-quarter-lap sprint on his lonesome.
At the members’ stand he was a good couple of lengths
ahead. MacFarland came with a magnificent effort, and,
trying to pass on the inside, touched Brook’s machine ;
but tbe N.S. Waler Hew on and crossed the line first amid
tremendous applause. The time was 2min. 4 4-ssec., and
the last 220 yd. occupied 12isec.' The Lawson Five Miles
scratch was a series of attempts by small bunches of riders
to get a break, ancl just as desperate racing on the part of
the field to prevent them. With four laps to go, Mutton,
J. Arnst, and Franks sailed away, and were leading by 40yd.
At the bell their start had been reduced to about half
that distance. The field looked as though it was going to
be left through a unanimous refusal to pace, but going
past the scoring board Megson sprinted and took the field
up to the flying three. Then there was a rush, and at the
members’ stand MacFarland came sailing through the
: ruck, past them all, one after the other, and crossed the
line first.
* * * *
Victorian cyclist A. E. Pye’s luck evaporated
with considerable suddenness. On Saturday night he
rode a great race in the semi-final of the Orient Plate, but
could get no closer than fourth to the boodle, and his
desperate rush for the Orient Plate £3O so exhausted him
that he scratched for the Five Miles. On Monday night,
in the final of the Wheel Race, worth £5O, he was handi-
capped quite out of it. With a man like 0. H. Brook
70yd. in front of him, and a gap of 40yd. between him and
George Horder, and with no assistance to cover the gap,
it was a foregone conclusion that the plucky little Vic-
torian had no hope. Still he put up a game struggle,
and at the bell he was up with, the tail of the
bunch, but was so exhausted by his effort that
he had to retire. A hundred yards past the
bell Brook sailed away, and the field had never a hope.
Brook “ walked ” in somewhere about half-a-dozen
lengths to the good. Twenty minutes later found Pye
engaged in a wild-cat struggle with Farley, who had 10yd.
start of him in the final of the Port Jackson Half-mile,
which was utterly ridiculous. Of course the champion
won—he could have done so without any handicap. The
third heat of the Port Jackson Handicap again found
MacFarland on the 15yd. mark, and again the
haughty American declined to race. However, he
came out in the Walker Five Miles scratch, and put up a
beautiful run, but Australian champion George Farley
came like a bullet at half way home. The American made
another effort at the members’ stand and drew level, but
Farley, with apparent ease, jumped clear and finished
first by nearly a lengthy It was a night of splendid
racing, although the wind interfered with the times. The
attendance was wretched, and has been right through the
meeting. Yet the racing was, on the average, far above
that of any previous meeting, and some of the finishes
were absolutely thrilling.
• * • *
George Farley is the bulkiest rider on the
Australian cycling tracks this season. Last year’s cham-
pion scales 14st., and his forward riding at the carnival
the other night gave the promise that trouble may be ex-
pected before the season is very far advanced. Farley has
almost improved out of sight as the outcome of his Con-
tinental trip.

The Dunlop Motor Reliability Test commenced
on Tuesday last, and to-day (Thursday) the competitors
are supposed to be struggling over the 121 miles between
Albury and Gundagai (N.S.W.). Last time the Test was
held from Sydney to Melbourne H. L. Stevenson buzzed
along in front from start to finish in a huge Darracq car,
and got over the 572 miles in 23b. 42min. Later on, in a
non-stop run-off, H. Tarrant, in one of the elegant Argyll
cars, won the first prize. The present race will finish at
the Motor “ Gymkhana,” whatever that is, at the Agri-
cultural Ground, Sydney.

Re that overloaded punt which upset on the
Saltwater River (Melbourne) on Cup day, and drowned
some people. It is alleged, as a grievous essay on the
horrors of Drink, that the publican across the river gives
an unusually large beer for 3d., and that that was the
reason why so many people wanted to get across, and
wanted to do it in such haste that about 30 of them
heaped themselves into a craft qualified for a much
smaller number. Alleged, also, that the man who ran
the punt wasn’t paid ; he was a Cup day volunteer, who
relied on the tips given him by people who were sprinting
for that unusually large threepenny beer.

A dying nor’-easter made yachting on Port
Jackson on Saturday afternoon a thing to be endured by
the aid of plenty of liquid refreshment. The modern
mind yearns for pace, and yachting is only fascinating
when the winged craft go plunging through it, and
tossing the spray high and far. The Yacht Squadron was
out after the Challenge Cup, the gift of Dr. M Cormick,
which has to be won three times to be permanently
acquired. Isea has won it twice, but was not competing
on this occasion, and six others have won it once. The
only contest was between Magic and Fleetwing, from Dob-
ro.vd to Manly, and Magic got in »front and stayed
there to the finish. But, as said before, it was a tedious
affair, and required much whisky to keep competitors
afloat. Sydney Flying Squadron’s show was somewhat
more interesting, and F. S. managed to work off two heats
and a final. The light wind brought out a flock of kites,
and although the racing was slow the spectacle was first-
rate. The heat-winhers turned up in Australian and
Arawa, and the final was appropriated by Australian,
with Alert and Federal second and third.

Balmain’s 56th annual regatta was held last
Monday, when the usual mammoth programme was faith-
fully gone through, and a dinner w&3 eaten, at which' the
usual aldermanic nonentity arose to heave dirt at
the Federal Parliament, and was not crushed by
Wilks, who replied. The afternoon brought along
a steady easterly wind, which was excellent for
the sailing events. There were yacht races, cutter races,
open boat races, all boats races, skiff and dingy contests.
Also motor-boats flashed about, decorated from mast to
water-line with palms, pot-plants and streamers. Besides
the two motor-boat races there were ten rowing events.
Altogether it was one of the brightest and best exhibi-
tions ever seen on Parramatta River—only disfigured by
Wilks and the dreadful alderman.

Notwithstanding that the representatives of
five States were competing for the Australasian Amateur
Athletic championships in perfect weather at Sydney
Cricket Ground, on Saturday, the attendance was very
poor. The chief feature of the meeting was the upheaval
of the poor old Mother State. Even the sour, grab-all
Carruthers must have been satisfied that there was, on
this occasion, no vile Victorian conspiracy. The 100 yd.
and the Mile Walking championships passed from Bent’s
State to N.S.W., Nigel Barker winning the running and
Pomeroy the walking match. Maoriland lost the 120 yd.
Hurdles, which went to C. P. Stewart, of N.S.W. The
440 yd. and putting the weight were retained for the
Cornstalk State by Nigel Barker and W. O’Reilly. Vic-
toria managed only to retain, through G. A. Wheatley,
the one mile championship, which Harvey Sutton won
for it previously. On Monday the tide' of Cornstalk
success continued at th ■ flood. ” Pomeroy carried off the
three-mile walking championship, which had previously
been held by Barrett, of Victoria. Maoriland did
not attempt to defend its ownership of the pole-
vault championship, which fell to R. A. Adams, of
N.S.W. The 161 b. hammer premiership also went to N.S.W.
per W. O’Reilly. Victoria lost the running- broad jump
to Nigel Barker, who also retained his hold on the 220 yd.
event. Wheatley, of Victoria, won the 880 yd. event,
which had previously been held for his own State by
Harvey Sutton, and W. P. Steele succeeded in retaining
the three-miles running championship for Victoria
against Waddy of N.S.W. Victoria’s solitary gain was
the 440 hurdles, which had previously been held by
G. W. Smith, of Maoriland, and over which F. P. Brown
beat Stewart and Nigel Barker. In points N.S.W. scored
10J, Vic. 4, Queensland J, and M.L. 0.
* * * *
If appearances are anything to go by, at time of
writing Queensland is in for a most unholy drubbing at
cricket from N.S.W. The Cornstalks heaped up 691, a
record score for inter-State cricket. Mackay made 203
and Charlie Gregory 102, aed Redgrave got within six of
a century. Altogether it was an amazing slogging exhi-
bition. In reply to this the Bananalanders could only
show a miserable 132, and, of course, followed on.
As Ecclesiastes said in regard to Rugby,
“ there is no fun in this sort of thing.” It isn’t
sport. At Adelaide the match between S. Australia and
Victoria showed an inclination to follow the same lines.
S. Australia hadn’t a century about it, and left only 244
behind it, and Victoria, at the end of the second day, had
put up 292 runs for the loss of only three wickets,
M'Alister carrying his bat for 135. Armstrong, the other
not-out man, was going strong at 65 when stumps were
drawn. When S. Australia was at the wickets it was con-
sidered that the side was making a very excellent stand,
and the batsmen were reported as “defying everything.”
Now, unless Victoria has a very attenuated tail, things
look bad for the Crow-Eaters.

Frank Laver predicts that both Jackson and
Fry will come'along next year with an English eleven if
the control of cricket in Australia has been “properly
settled.” Fry might join the team, but Jackson, who
has many times declined the trip, is a very unlikely
visitor. He shirked many of his county engagements last
season, pleading inability to spare the time.
■* * * »
There is more than a suspicion in N.S.W.
cricket circles that there will be a big dropping of Aus-
tralian XI. players in the inter-State fixtures for the
coming season. Personal associations have played a big
part in the N.S.W. team for many years ; but the ousting
of Noble from the selection committee is believed to be
the preliminary step to the inclusion of young players in
the team. There are hosts of young colts of great pro-
mise stamping their feet outside the State team’s door-step.

“B.B.”: Just-ended Australian XI. tour will be
the last for J. J. Kelly—the hardy stumper having yielded
to medical advice, and decided not to be a target for bowlers
henceforth in any branch of cricket. Kelli' has borne the
brunt of the wicket-keeping for Australia and N.S.W. for
many years, and appeared to be invulnerable; but the
inability of reserve-stumper Newland to withstand assault
and battery during the recent tour, left Kelly no option
but to get smashed up generally. While Kelly was in the
Australian team, all Australia was satisfied ; henceforth
there will be much inter-State wrangling in the matter.

Last week Victorian law had a further set-to with
the “ gambling evil,” finishing by leaving matters in as big
a mix-up as ever. A while back Justice Hodges foolishly
held that Chow lottery tickets showed no evidence of
gambling, as they might be religious leaflets, or lessons in
moral culture, or anything at all, and the fact that cer-
tain persons planted certain blots on certain of the
characters, at a cost of 3d. or 6d., didn’t prove any
gamble. Later brother A’Beckett cordially and wisely
scoffed at this judgment, and remarked that nobody but
a lunatic would pay to be allowed to put ink-blobs on a
piece of yellow paper for the fun of the thing, and that
anyone in his right mind could see the evidence of a
lottery. Last week these two g-entlemen sat with brother
Hood as a Pull Court, and as brother Hood sided with
brother Hodges, the decision went their way, and the
convictions—with their £2O fines —were quashed and the
cases ordered to be re-heard. Thereupon the collective
Ah Sins, knowing that the Crown might produce more
detailed evidence, and mindful also of the robustness and
virility of the gentleman named Costs, casually in-
quired “How muchee?” and agreed to have their £2O
fines reduced to £5 each, the convictions being allowed to
stand. As matters dwell now, some 20 Chinkie banks
have been fined a fiver each for selling their precious
“tickets”; they still continue the game, and may be
summoned again at any moment; but as the Law has
already decided that their conviction was illegal, it may
upset any future conviction—or again it may not. _ The
Law, in the matter of gambles, seems to be getting fright-
fully uncertain as it goes along.

The effort to revive professional pedestrianism
at the Golden Gate track in George-street, Sydney, last
week showed that the labors of the promoters are
appreciated by the public, if not by a section of the
athletes. There was a general air of cronkness sur-
rounding many of the heats, and the committee dealt
vigorously with a few of the assassins of the game. One
heat was so “strong” that it was declared “ no race,”
and three months’ disqualification (“life” would have
been more fitting) was dealt out to the runners.
As an excitement - maker there were points
about the Sturgeon-Errol scrap at Sydney National
Sporting Club last week. Errol hails from South Africa,
and Sturgeon is the man who, in the days when he was
familiarly known as “ Snowy,” was for a long time unable
to get a fight, bruisers reckoning him a good man to kstp.
clear of. The rst round of the mill was very brilliant,
Sturgeon hitting like lightning. He tried to stand off and
thump, but the man from the Chow-flogging continent
continued attempting to clinch, only to be hit on
the jaw by both hands before he could manage it.
He appealed to the referee, but the appeal
was dismissed. Then he waded in and thumped like
a machine, and Sturgeon, in his turn, was compelled
to hang on for respite. Recovering, he caug-ht the
African against the ropes and hooked him unmercifully
about the head. It was a most sensational round. Errol
pulled himself together and gave Sturgeon a very rough
time till the bell went. The third round saw the African
rush in. Snowy backed off, but was too slow. A left
hook caught him on the jaw, and a right swing hit him
■on the back of the head, and a wild-cat strugg'le ensued,
at the end of which Errol tried to clinch. But Sturg-eon
worked his arms free, and rained a shower of blows that
sent Errol to the floor, where he was counted out.

At Sydney Gaiety Club on Saturday night Mr.
Green, of Balmain, shook hands with Mr. Ladbury, of
London, Bow Bells, England. For the first seven rounds
it looked as though the fight, like the brook, would go on
for ever. As a boxer Ladbury was distinctly superior,
and he continued to land with grace and deftness on the
Balmain dial. His left fell regularly and softly as the dew
from heaven, Green retaliating with hooks and body
swings. Ladbury’s smacks lacked power, but they kept
Green off. Each succeeding round was warmer than the
previous one ; both youths worked harder, but neither
seemed to be able to inflict any damage ; and it looked as
though it was going to be a test of boilers and
nothing more. In the eighth round, however, Lad-
bury stood in close and brought a heavy, resounding
right on to Green’s jaw. The man from Balmain heeled
over like a ferry steamer at a boat race. Then the
Londoner threw his caution to the winds and rushed in to
settle the Australian, and was astounded to meet a right
and left swing fair on the jaw. He sagged at the knees,
shock and astonishment seemed to paralyse him, and
then another right struck the same spot, and he took
five seconds’ respite on the floor. Then he was up and
down again for another five seconds; and after that he
was up and down again for six seconds. His increasing
down ness was noticeable. Next Mr. Green tapped
him heavily on the stomach and the jaw, and Mr. Ladbury
went down altogether, leaving' Green still bantam
champion.

Pimples and Blotches.
Cured by Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills.
When the skin is red with blotches or pimples,
it is a sure indication that the bood is out of order.
Instead of resorting' to cosmetics, powders and
paints, which are poisonous and cause irritation to
the skin, you should take a course of Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills. These pills cleanse and purify
the blood, and at the same time, by their action on
the digestive organs, assist in nourishing the body
and replenishing the system with new blood, rich
and red, which, circulating through the veins,
gives the skin a fresh and pure appearance, glow-
ing with the tint of perfect health. Mrs. Dunston,
of 34 Shepherd-street, Redfern, Sydney, writes :
“ It affords me much pleasure to inform you that
your Pills have been of wonderful aid to me. For
over eighteen months I was a victim to dreadful
headaches, and that unwell feeling—always tired
and languid. I broke out in a rash covering my
face, and then I consulted two doctors, whose
treatment did me no good whatever. One day
your little book came into my hands, and I thought
I would buy your remedy. This I did, and I had
the satisfaction of finding that they were doing me
much good. Indeed, they soon cleared the un-
sightly disfigurement from my face, and gradually
the headaches disappeared. I still take a pill or
two, once or twice a week, with the very best
results. They keep me free from all disorders,
and I feel in perfect health.”*

THE AUSTRALIAN DRIIC CJL’fSTDHE
The defence in the Pinkenba (Q.) case, in
which Samuel Hannah and Sarah Howden were
charged, at the Brisbane Supreme Court, with the
murder of the latter’s husband, had been just
entered upon. Hannah was in the witness-box—
his last chance of defence—when the strains of
slow music were heard in the street outside the
court-house. It was the Dead March that was
being played in front of a Salvation Army officer’s
cortege. The court was shrouded in the dark
n ess of an approaching storm, the rumble of
which could be heard in the distance. Justice
Heal sat up straighter than ever—silent, listening,
meditating. Examining counsel sought to break
the spell by proceeding with a question just as tha
accused vvitness broke down in the box and the
woman in the dock swooned. The Judge stretched
out his hand ; then, as the sound or the dirge
round a street corner, he said:
(gentlemen, I did not anticipate this. Adjourn
the court till to-morrow morning.”
N.S.W. Premier Carruthers has promised,
in a casual sort of way, to drop a large part
of his Old Age Pensions Bill. It is an iniquitous
Bill, and Carruthers isn’t strong even in his in-
iquity. Also when the Upper House demanded
that the farmer and pastoralist, who paid local
rates under the new Local Government scheme,
should be exempted from land and income taxes
(though the city manufacturer has to pay all
three), the weak Carruthers caved in such haste
that he passed the Exemption Bill through the
Assembly without waiting to be sure that the
Upper House wouldn’t reject his Local Govern-
ment Bill after all. Then he started to denounce
the Australian Government with unusual viru-
ifnce for proposing to get its stamps printed in
Adelaide in the interests of economy. Every time
the weak Carruthers doubles up like a wet rag on
his State policy, he tries to retrieve his character
as a strong man by denouncing the Australian
Government.
At the recent sitting of the High Court,
at Sydney, barrister Gordon rose and, in an
injured voice, complained to the Bench that there
was actually no gratis foolscap on the table for
the Bar to make notes upon. All the other
learned gentlemen present looked deeply hurt,
and one member of the Bench was impressed with
the profundity of the grievance, and remarked
that the Department was conducted with “ex-
treme economy;” though why on earth the
Federal taxpayer should be expected to buy
foolscap so that highly-paid barristers can scrawl
caricatures of their Honors upon it, while waiting
fora “learned friend” to conclude his address*
only the acutely-trained legal intellect can under-
stand. Of course, if Gordon, K.C., really cannot
afford a penny notebook, the Government might
charitably give him a bit of paper occasionally to
draw pot-hooks upon—provided that Gordon,
K.C., looked becomingly grateful for the kindness!
But when a rich barrister is begging for paper he
should be respectful, like any other person who
wants something without payment.

THE SUGAR BONUS.
The daily newspapers of Sydney have been so
busy of late discussing the appalling injustice
that has been inflicted upon the poor old Mother
State by the decision of the Australian Govern-,
ment to get its stamps printed in Adelaide at 2£d.
per 1000 instead of in Sydney at 7£d. per 1000, that
they haven’t had time to draw public attention to
trifling little matters like the progress of white
labor in the sugar industry. A report, recently
presented to the House of Representatives by Dr.
Maxwell, contains figures which appear to dis-
prove conclusively the old but oft-repeated yarn
that sugar can’t be grown by white labor in
Queensland. But while the stamp-printing busi-
ness is on deck, and the rights of the poor old Mother
State have to be preserved, even at the risk of
secession, it can hardly be expected that the
newspapers should find space for the dis-
cussion of points which involve nothing but
a mere matter of national policy, on which
the future of one of the largest Australian
industries depends. If only someone could dis-
cover in Dr. Maxwell’s report something which
threatened a new “hardship” on the Mother
State, this thick blanket of indifference would
lift. The Daily Telegraph would print leading
articles darkly hinting that secession was not so
impossible as some people thought; old gentle-
men in the Legislative Council would call upon
the heroic J. Carruthers to rise up in defence of
State rights, and put an end to this intolerable
burden of injustice and oppression; and .T. Car-
ruthers himself would tell stupid members of
Parliament, in answer to asinine questions, that
the Government viewed the suggestions of Dr.
Maxwell with grave apprehension, and every
care would be taken by the Government to con-
serve the rights of the poor old Mother State.
But though Dr. Maxwell’s report can’t be
twisted anyhow into a threat of injustice to the
poor old Mother State, it is an important and
interesting document. It proves that the people
who said that the sugar industry could not be
maintained without Kanaka labor were absolutely
wrong. And, although the daily newspapers
don’t seem to think so, that is a matter of immense
importance to Australians; and even if all this
country’s stamps were printed on Wild Horse
Plains in S.A. it would matter little by com-
parison.
r • * * *
The policy of charging a reduced excise on
sugar grown by white labor was adopted in 1902,
with the avowed object of encouraging sugar
growers to get rid of the Kanaka. Dr. Maxwell’s
report proves—so far as three years’ experience
can prove—that that policy was sound and states-
manlike. In 1902 there were 1421 white growers,
cultivating an area of 36,538 acres. In 1905 there
were 2681 white growers, with 72,606 acres. The
total number of sugar growers in Queensland is
3422, and 78 per cent, of these employ only white
labor. Of course, the great majority of white
growers, and the greater part of the area culti-
vated by whites, are naturally in the southern
and central districts. But the most striking
feature in the report is —that by far the greatest
relative increase in the employment of white labor
has taken place in the northern district, the very
fortress of black labor. In 1902 there were only
36 white growers in this district, cultivating an
area of 1882 acres. To-day th ?re are 124 white
growers, with 5024 acres. This rate of increase is
nearly, if not quite, double that which has occurred
in the southern and central districts. Sugar can

be grown and is being grown, by white labor in
ucgiunu, s
every part ot Queensiana. „
' ... , , , i , T
Unfortunately, this is not the wnoie story, in
spite of the fact that 78 per cent, of the growers
employ only white labor, Dr. Maxwell points
out that the other 22 per cent.. who employ black
labor and who represent nearly all large growers,
iAuoi, aim ‘ 1 f ... , ii ' nrrl ,. nn (. n f
produce nearly two-tlurds of
sugarproduced in Queensland. 1 nese large growers,
of courseware hanging on to their beloved Kanaka
till the last minute, in the hope that something
v turn UP They are doing this, as Dr.
may vu F- Rnnrlabere- district
Maxwell shows, even in “laberg a at ot,
where it has been proved beyond all question
that white men can and will do the work, unaer
these circumstances they will hardly expect much
svmnathv from Parliament if, when the time
comes for them to part with their Kanakas, they
have a difficulty in finding, on the instant, white
men ready to take their places. Perhaps it is
hardly right to say that they won’t expect
sympathy; it is safer to say that they won’t get
it. This, however, is by the way. If nothing
“ turns up ” to save the Kanaka before the end of
2906 _ an d at present there seems to be mighty
little chance of anything of that kind “ turn-
ing up ” —the growers who are continuing
to°use black labor will have no one but themselves
to thank if they find themselves in sudden diffi-
culty. Probably the very useful Bills introduced
by the Government to increase the excise and the
rebate, and thus to decrease the Protection
afforded to black-grown sugar, will afford these
gentlemen a useful reminder.
Westralian Land Settlement.
Westralia is making great efforts to attract im-
migrants from England, but it is difficult to
reconcile the alluring pictures presented by lec-
turers with eloquence and magic lantern slides,
and the blank depressing reality as set forth by
Ministers in some of their more candid moments.
For instance, this was almost the last jeremiad of
the last ex-Minister for Lands :
During September 40 homestead blocks have been for-
feited. This means practically the loss of £240 in survey
fees, to say nothing of the fact that these blocks have
been locked up from settlement for the past three years.
. . . Numbers of conditional purchase blocks have also
been taken up and forfeited.
Which means that you can put almost any kind
of people on to almost any kind of land, but it
takes more than lectures and lantern slides to
make them stay there. The lot of Westralian
selectors does not appear to be particularly happy,
unless their holdings chance to be on one of the
few favored spots along the Great Southern line.
There is some really good land in that region, but
it is nearly all locked up by land agents, Crown
land inspectors and their friends, who have got in
first. One official drawing £4OO per annum owns
over 4000 acres within a mile or two of a big rail-
way centre, and as each acre is worth £4 to £5
the State might reasonably give him permanent
leave to look after his estate. In the Bankruptcy
Court at Perth recently, a man who had been in-
duced to go on the land said he only had £l2 to
start with, but he got money from the State Agri-
cultural Bank on the security of his unpaid-for
conditional purchase. Then he thought had
invented a new air-ship, and went off to England
to make a big pot of money out of it. He made a
breakage instead, and sorrowfully confessed his
inability to pay anything in the pound. He has
had the Agricultural Bank’s money and the bank
has the land, but as the land belonged to the State
in the first instance taxpayers may well ask where
they come in. There is one way to promote a
little real settlement in Groperland—to cut up
such good land as there is among real settlers
instead of letting John Forrest’s friends keep it
in big areas mostly unused, but that prospect, to
those gentlemen, is too horrible for words.
A Coal Tragedy.
“ Ku-Klux,” from a Victorian coal-mining town :
My first view of Outtrim called to mind most forcibly
the old Bible verse—“ A city that is set upon a hill and
cannot be hid.” The township is built on hillsides
surrounding a basin in such a way that no privacy (in the
day time) is possible. Mrs. Smith, washing in her back-
yard on one hillside, can hear Mrs. Brown, half-a-mile
away on the opposite hillside, making audible comments
on the quality of her window-curtains. There is little, I
am told, to identify Outtrim of the past. In the old days,
money flowed freely, all men were friends, and the town
waxed fat. That was in the days when the curse of
Unionism was rampant in the land. Now all things are
changed. Men come and go (mostly go), and the town
is dead. There are, I am told, 175 empty houses in
Outtrim. 1 counted 105 myself, and then got tired of
climbing hills, so I take the figures as given.
Money is scarce—so scarce that the local boardinghouse-
keeper waits at the mine on pay-days for the new class
of coal-miner, who has a painful habit of departing with-
out saying good-bye. There are three classes of men
here First, the remnants of the men who were locked out
—only a mere handful now, but all men who had homes
which they were unable to sell, and so had to stay
ou under the new conditions. Second come the original
blacklegs. Their numbers are also fast diminishing. They
seem to have been a cross between a Flying Angel and a
Bourke-street Rat. At any rate, after their work was
done the mine management soon found an excuse to sack
o£ th - The t fc ird )ot are men who came here after
fche lock . out was over—respectable, hard-working men,
mos t of them, to whom the deceptive offer of 9s. a day
se emed a fortune. They came to find that if they worked
hard they might earn, after tools, oil, and explosives were
paid for, about 4s. 6d. to 6s. a day. The average is more
DRUNK AGAIN.
DEADBRORE (after he, has partaken) “ Better chalk these down, Miss!"
HEBE (with some heat): “Chalk drinks down to you Not much. Don’t do things
like that, my man.”
D RATIBRORE: “ Just as you please. But you might forget them.”
like 4s. 6d. These tools, oil, &c., are all supplied by the
companies at high prices. A new-comer is put on to
work, and supplied with pick and shovel, lamp, oil, &c.
He works, say, four days, and then gets the sack—he
probably never saw a coal mine before in his life. He has
to dispose of his tools, so he sells them to the company ; of
course, after four days’ work they are nearly worn out,
and he only gets just what the company thinks fit to give
—which is not much. And he probably departs in debt
to some unfortunate boardinghouse-keeper. And the
company sells his tools over again to the next fool. I met
two men yesterday who had worked five shifts and had
drawn lid. from the.company. Not exceptional cases,
either.
The men who came since the lock-out all regard
the blackleg with contempt. Indeed, amongst the
blacklegs themselves there are a few who see to what
a rotten state they have brought the Victorian coal-
miner’s lot. The local business man talks of
the awful tyranny of the Unions, and then in the
next breath proceeds to deplore the present state of the
town and compare it with Outtrim of the old days, when
almost every man owned his own house (there are not
many such in Outtrim at present), and all had money to
sptnd and spent it freely.
And now the houses stand empty, and the fences are
broken down, and the trail of the blackleg is over it all.
But men look hopefully in the direction of Melbourne,
whence vague rumors drift up of a Royal Commission
appointed by somebody to inquire into something.
♦
George Graham, M.L.A. (Victoria), has been
associated with agriculture all his life, and repre-
sents a farming electorate. He is one of the most
solid Conservatives of the Vic. Assembly, and
nobody would accuse him for a moment of being
influenced by the Trades Hall or any other radical
institution. Yet listen to what George has to say
about State ownership of mail steamers, based on
his acquaintance with the export trade and his ex-
perience as a member of the Butter Commission.
On Thursday, he was examined before the Select
Committee on State-owned steamers, and here is
a piece of his evidence
Prom the inception of the butter industry the mail
companies have looked after No. 1, and extracted from
the producer as much as they could get. . . . They have
been a great bar to the dairying industry. Exorbitant
freights were demanded.
The Chairman : Did you personally ask the manager of
the P. and O. Companv'to carry butter at id. per lb. ?
Yes, I did ; but he replied that the mail companies were
carrying at bedrock prices, and that even then, when they
were charging |d. per lb., there was a loss. At that very
time the companies were secretly arranging with a com-
mittee appointed in Victoria for another contract for
three years at fd. per lb.
By whom was the committee appointed ?—lt was sup-
posed to have been appointed at the request of the
Director of Agriculture, but, reading between the lines,
we, as a commission, saw that it was working in the
interests of the mail companies, with a view of getting
another contract before the report of the Commission
came out.
What freight do you think the Commonwealth Govern-
ment could guarantee per annum ?—I think £300,000.
Can you suggest a remedy for the present position ? —I
think the surest remedy would be for the Government to
carry our produce by water as well as by land. At pre-
sent it is brought by rail to the seaboard, and then it is
at the mercy of the shipping combine and the middlemen.
No doubt some will say that it would be outrageous
for the Government to get ships of its own, but when
we consider that upwards of £130,000,000 is invested in
the railways of the Commonwealth, it is surely not too
much to ask that £5,000,000, or even £10,000,000, should
be spent in carrying our produce and taking our mails
over the ocean.
Do you think it would be a financial success ?—I feel
certain it would. Moreover, the ships would be a training
ground for the navy, and in time of war they could be
used as auxiliary cruisers.

Melbourne City Corporation has added to itself
the municipalities of North Melbourne and
Flemington and Kensington. This is a step in
the direction of a Greater Melbourne scheme,
which is to take under one central administration
the whole of the metropolitan area, at one time
divided into 22 municipalities. Melbourne City
is notoriously wealthy, and, though it calls it by
another name, notoriously socialistic. It owns
baths, electric lighting, markets, abattoirs, its
own insurance fund, and a host of other things,
all of which return a profit, and form splendid
arguments for the socialist. In the Melbourne
City Council there is not, however, one Labor
member, and anti-Socialism smiles contentedly at
the socialistic schemes of members of its own
party, without knowing that they are socialistic.
The hated Labor element is going to come into
the City Council with a rush now, however.
Prendergast, leader of the State Opposition, is
Mayor of North Melbourne, and certain to be
returned to the council. Stephen Barker, the
secretary of the Trades Hall Council, is another
certainty. Dobson, the Mayor of Flemington
and Kensington, was last year president of the
Trades Hall Council. Altogether, the City Coun-
cil will receive as strong an injection of real red-
hot national Socialism as it is possible to give it,
and it may be expected to go far in the socialising
of industry and business.
In The Outlook (London) for July 29 and
August 5 Richard Jebb, known to Australis-
readers for his able and comprehensive “Studies
in Colonial Nationalism,” puts forward a good
case for an Imperial Telegraph system, owned by
the various Governments within the Empire. He
argues:
A cable monopoly, like the railway monopolies in the
United States, wiil continue to wield an irresistible
weapon in differential rates, secret or open, against
which democracy and its legislators may rage in vain.
In this age of combination, the perpetuation of the cable
monopoly in private hands, together with the encourage-
ment of the Press by means of a lower scale of rates,
would lead ultimately to the control of newspapers by a
cable ring, and the throttling of the genuine expression
of public opinion throughout the Empire. It is alleged
even now that the big newspapers in Australia have com-
bined in an arrangement with the cable companies which
effectively closes the field to new journals. The rumor
gains color from the unnatural hostility which has been
manifested by a section of the Australian press towards
the Pacific cable.
That view will be promptly accepted in Australia,
which suffers now seriously from two evils : igno-
rance as to the affairs of the great world outside—
the news supplied by a press monopoly acting
with a cable monopoly being meagre and some-
times distorted ; and ignorance as to the Common-
wealth in Great Britain, which is mostly supplied
with Australian news from Stinking Fish sources.
Premier Bent, of Victoria, has periodical attacks
of Socialism. It is true that the Tory press and
the Tory members of Parliament generally
succeed in curing him before anything socialistic
really happens ; but still some of his schemes may
materialise, and then Torydom will stand aghast
at the work of its servant. Bent s latest
proposal—a nebulous proposal, so far —is
a tax on unimproved land values. He
lately announced in the House that.he intended to
place before the Cabinet a revision of the whole
system of taxation. He had seen 40 miles of
country near Melbourne, only 500 acres of which
were cultivated. The owners of this land were
going to do a great deal when they got a rail-
way. They got it, but still did nothing. One
estate the Government had purchased —Over-
newton —paid only 2s. 6d. per £lOO in land
tax. He wanted to alter that sort of thing
and lighten the burden in other directions.
These are brave words, and if Bent can only
screw himself up to sticking point he may do
something notable yet in addition to his one great
performance of reducing the public debt. Swin-
burne is the only man of character in the Cabinet,
and he is much more advanced in his ideas than
Bent. The others will follow Thomas to the
gates of Hades, so long as by so doing they can
keep their portfolios. Where the new idea will
meet with opposition will be from the proputty
class in both Houses. Manifold and Co., in the
House of Landlords, will, of course, raise a shriek
of indignant protest; but that sort of treatment
doesn’t affect Bent. It's when the enemy gets
him by the ear far away from the public eye that
he crumples up. Bent in public is heroic, and if
he could always be kept in public, and be made to
even go to bed in public, he might do things.
But in private conference his stomach turns to
woter, and all his great plans melt away into
nothingness.

“Puck” on the subject of Australian defence: —
How General Hutton must have laughed to himself at
his Australian masters ! His scheme of organisation was
drawn up, not for the defence of Australia, but to provide
an expeditionary force to supplement the British army ;
and he made no secret of his views in his report (19021.
Big.toiin Forrest, protesting to the Reps, hy All his gods
this should not be, left Australia to its fate (and Hutton)'
while he hastened to the Coronation grovel.
The expeditionary scheme, which was then adopted as it
stood, provides the defence organisation of to-day, while
Parliament remains blissfully unconscious of the fact.
When Parliament insisted on retrenchment Hutton
reduced the Garrison Artillery, a purely defensive force,,
till hardly enough men were left to clean the guns]; but
the expeditionary forces have to-day a stronger war-
footing than was ever contemplated by the original
scheme. Hutton knew what he wanted, and took care-
he got it. Australia, which paid his salary, knew what,
it didn’t want, but it got what it didn’t want all the same..

HALF-YEARLY REPORT of the DIRECTORS of THE BANK OF AUSTRALASIA,
With the Accounts for the Half- Year to 10th APRIL, 1905. Presented to the Proprietors at the Half-Yearly General
Meeting* held on THURSDAY, sth OCTOBER, 1905.
REPORT.
The Directors submit to the Proprietors the Balance Sheet as at 10th April last, with the Profit
Account for the half-year to that date. After providing for rebate on bills current, for British and
Colonial rates and taxes, and for all bad and doubtful debts, the net profit for the half year amounted
to £136,152135. lid. , , , , • o
To this sum must be added £16,951 ss. brought forward from the previous half-year, making a
total of £153,103 18s. lid., out of which the Directors have declared a dividend for the half-year at the
rate of 12 per cent, per annum, or £2 Bs. per share, free-of income tax
The Dividend will absorb £96,000, and the Directors have further appropriated £30,000 to the
Reserve Fund, and £lO,OOO in reduction of the cost of Bank Premises. There will then remain
£17,103 18s. lid. to be carried forward to the next account. ...
The dividend will be payable, in London and in the Colonies, on the 6th October next.
The Directors have, with much regret, to record the unexpected retirement through ill-health of
Mr. John Sawers, the Superintendent since 1887 of the Colonial Establishments of the Bank. As the
Proprietors are aware, the Directors have always placed the highest value on the services of JVLr.
Sawers, and the termination of his connection with the'Bank is sincerely regretted.
Since the date of the last Report the Bank has opened new Branches at Crow’s Nest, m Queens-
land, and at Eltham and Temuka, in New Zealand, and has closed its Branches at Ravenswood, in
Queensland, and Lennonville, in Western Australia. n . rir ,„.,,t •

“Robert Hap,” on the innards of the
community:—
It is not good to be “on the lodge.” If a person really
wants a start along- the uneven path to the Necropolis,
let him buy a medical work and keep it handy. Then,
when the pork disagrees with him, he can look up the
book and study the symptoms of every disease, and finally
decide that he hasn’t long- to live. After that it is quite
easy to make his relatives and friends wish he had an even
shorter time to live. A healthy man joins a lodge because
he fancies that some day an illness will overtake him.
The rest is easy. Continuous good health and the mono-
tony of paying the regular weekly subscription for four
or five years bring on an attack of what is known as
“lodge patient’s hypochondria.”
Women who live in mean streets are very fond of
lodges. They “pay in” in the hope of one day having
to call in the doctor for some trivial disorder. They
imagine that a doctor’s motor-cycle at the front door
lends tone, and that his visit brings the family under
sympathetic discussion (although some neighbors are
nasty 7 enough to withhold sympathy 7 till after the funeral).
People who don’t belong to lodges wonder why a
doctor bothers with a lodge patient when he knows he
isn’t really ill. These people should know that the
doctor hasn’t a say 7 in the matter. The member says
he is ill, and there’s an end of it. And if the doctor
doesn’t write something' in Latin in the patients hook,
his discourtesy is made the subject of debate at the
next lodge meeting, and at the end of the year he may
find himself minus his lodge practice—and by a majority
of one vote. In this way, healthy beings are being
transformed into human drug repositories, if not victims
of the drug habit. I)r. Holmes said, “If the materia
medica was sunk in the sea, it would be all the better for
man and all the worse for the sea.” But when people can
obtainas much medicine as they wish for the sum of Is.,
paid weekly, there is little hope of the whole materia
medica finding its harmless, necessary grave.
‘‘Nulla”: In about eight months time
200,000 acres on the Dorrigo and Camboyne
(N.S.W.), mostly covered with fine timber, will
be thrown open. Then, before the selector’s axe
and firestick, timber with a present and prospec-
tive value of hundreds of thousands of pounds
will make way for the straggling ears of corn and
the animal Bent raises his hat to. The bush
must retreat before settlement, but with a sen-
sible land-tax there would be more than enough
arable land for years to come without the neces-
ity of destroying valuable forests.

They restore sufferers to a perfect, healthy state. This is not the confession of merely one person, but o f
TWICE TEN THOUSAND HEN TALKING TO YOU.
These have been Restored to Health by the world-renowned Specialists, and if they are willing to
sacrifice all reserve to prove to you that this is so, you should take enough heed of the matter to
make careful investigation.
The Freeman and Wallace Electro-Medical Treatmant
brings back VIM, VIGOR, and ENERGY to men and women who have wasted their strength and
energies. Those who have wrecked their health MUST certainly suffer. Remember that, and be warned
in time.

You have suffered long and seriously. Why not let us assist you in the realisation of rapid relief and
complete cure ? THIS WE CAN DO WITHOUT DOUBT if you will confide in us. Read the following
description or Keynote Symptoms, and if you have any of them you may rest assured you require the
remarkable treatment that has won name and fame for the Freeman and Wallace Electro-Medical
Institutes of Health and Healing.
FAILING VIGOR.
When this begins to go, you
will twitch and show signs of
premature weakness. Fol-
lowing are some of the symp-
toms :
Your facial nerves twitch,
You are all run down,
Spots before your eyes,
The muscles twitch,
Pains in small of back,
Pains in head,
Shooting pains,
You feel fatigued,
You are weary,
Your head swims,
Your knees knock,
Your hand trembles.
NERVOUS TWITCH-
ING.
A nervous person easily gets all
of a tremble, gets fits of weak-
ness, fits of twitching.
Here are some symptoms :
Your eyes twitch,
Your hands tremble,
You feel shaky,
You walk haltingly,
You are melancholy,
Ringing in the ears,
Blood is poor,
Your eyes weak,
Your eyes bleary,
Your head swims.
DEBILITY.
This affliction destroys ambition,
organic strength, energy, and
hope. Following are symp-
toms : -
You feel weak,
You feel cold,
Your back aches,
You lose flesh,
You sleep poorly,
Are low-spirited,
Your eyes sunken,
You have hot flushes,
Your memory impaired,
No real vigor,
You have sick headaches,
Nausea after eating,
Hands or feet moist,
Brightness leaves the eye.'
DO NOT DELAY.— Delays are at all times dangerous. You would not throw away a grain of
gold ; neither would you discard a pearl of great price ; yet health is more to you than any of these.
What is the value of a million of money, doubled fourfold, to a millionaire, if his arteries are aneurised, or
his brain softenened beyond.all hope of cure? The moral of these facts lies in the proverbial truth—Do
not delay. PROCRASTINATION IS THE PRECIPICE BELOW WHICH YAWNS THE AWFUL GULF
OF DEATH. AVOID IT !
LOSE NO CHANCE.— Every man knows it is dangerous to trifle with disease. You might as
well stand at the mouth of a loaded cannon. While you have time, write to the SPECIALISTS at the
INSTITUTE ; state your symptoms, act according to their instructions, and you will soon be your old
self again. Their record is a series of professional triumphs. THEY HAVE THOUSANDS OF TESTI-
MONIALS TO PROVE THEIR UNEQUALLED SKILL.

We publish here two testimonials out of the

CURES.
MR. PATRICK LARKIN, J.P., of Sydney, after a brief
course of our medical methods, writes regarding
our Electro-Medical Treatment:—
“ I am satisfied it gives health and vigor to the
system. For some time my nerves were out of
tone, but now I am perfectly well, and have regained
my usual strength.”
MR. RALPH WELLS, of Melbourne, a Professional
Pugilist of very high order, and who recently
fought Jim Corbett, writes to us on October
Ist, 1904, thus : \
“It gives me pleasure to state I have beep under
your methods, being run down and suffering from
poorness of blood, with its complications. A brief
course of treatment at your hands has had most
satisfactory results and I am myseif again.”

FACTS THAT DEFY ARGUMENT.
We are treating thousands of cases annually, and is it not reasonable to suppose that we under-
stand such cases better than those who are treating only a few hundred? Practice makes perfect in
any line, and it is none the less true in the treatment of disease. You get the benefit of Experience
when you place your case in our hands. Do not despair. Order your treatment at once', and let us
add your name to our long list of cures.

If the slightest doubt exists in your mind that our treatment will not cure you, it is. a duty you
owe to yourself to write to some of the references we herein publish, and send an addressed envelope
for reply. Ask any of the attendants who have given their testimonies to us if they think we can
benefit you. We court the closest investigation. Our Parcel Post System is a blessing to all sick
men living in centres far from medical men and aid. Thousands of men would now be in their graves

“Mirumbeek”: The legend lingers even in
the city that the average jeweller takes the good jewels
of a watch movement and puts inferior ones in their
stead. After 30 years at the trade, me say I never
found a jewel set in a watch yet that would repay me
to remove just in order to replace it with another. Nor
are gems often stolen from rings and brooches, as some
believe. The gems in 99 out of 100 articles of jewellery
worn nowadays are not worth giving a dishonest thought
to.
HAVE YOU A
BAD LEG ?
With Wounds that discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and sw'o'len, t>at when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried. w>hich. if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints bring
ulcerated, the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds; the disease,
if allowed to continue,will deprive you of thepowerto wak.
You may have attended various hospitals and had medical
advice and been told your case is hopeless, or advised to
submit to amputation ; but do not, for I can cure you. I
don’t say perhaps, but I will. Because others have failed
itisno reason I should. Send at once for a Box of Albert s

SCOTT’S EMULSION
of cod liver oil with glycerine and
the hypophosphites of lime and
soda will surely bring back hope
—and health ! Such was the expe-
rience of Mrs. Mabel Innes who
on August 18th , 1904, wrote us this
letter from 102, Silver Street,
Marrick ville, N.S.W.: —
A
m
A
\
boy, Roy, had
been subject to
severe attacks
of bronchitis
and I could not
get any thing-to
cure him. He
took Sc ott’s
Emulsion read-
ily and from
the first dose
his cough
and breathing
became much
easier. He is
plump, rosy-
cheeked, and
restored to
complete good
health. I strongly
advise all mothers
who have delicate
or ailing children to
give them a course of
Scott’s Emulsion.’'
Scott’s Emulsion
is perfectly digesti-
ble and therefore
enables the system to
absorb the full bene-
/fit of the oil, instead
of allowing much of it
to pass away to waste,
/as common oil and in-
ferior emulsions do.

“ Two Seas” : As I pay-1 s. 4d. per lb. for Paris
green, with postage added, I would be glad to hear from
“ F.C.” (B. 5/10/’O5) the address of the country storekeeper
who sells it at 6d. It strikes me that storekeepers are
not allowed to sell poisons now, as they used to—not even
bluestone and arsenic, of which country stores supplied
large quantities until the chemists found a way of sup-
pressing the trade in their own interests. No doubt
-Barabbas added drug-selling to his flourishing land-agency
business; but, all the same, I have never noticed the
uniformity of chemists’ charges that “F.C.” mentions.
My latest experience of the cost of one prescription was :
Made up in Sydney Is. (id., suburbs Is. 9d., country town
(on railway line) 2s. 6d. To the latter I ejaculated,
“ Whaffor'i” and he knocked off 6d. without a murmur.
A business that will allow its owner to knock 20 per cent,
-off his price with a smile might appeal to Barabbas. Yet
even a chemist doesn’t keep as many motor-cars as his
brother in the drapery business.

“JE.W. A.” : Re the automatic stoker (B. 8/6/’O5).
It may interest your readers to know that at the Ultimo
(Sydney) tram power-house 36 large boilers are stoked by
iron “men.” Also all the work of coal-trimming (about
250 tons per diem), and emptying the ash-pits is done by
the same ‘ persons.” [But it was a marine stoker that
was called for ; practically all up-to-date land works use
the land-boiler variety.]
Adelaide is a go-as-you-please hamlet. When
there is a rush on one of the suburban tram lines a super-
annuated extra vehicle is put on, and there isn’t suf-
ficient staff to man the extra car. So the ancient trap
does without a conductor, and when the driver goes round
collecting fares, the passengers take turns at driving.
* * * *
“F.” writes: “ Melbourne Age published, the
other day, a letter from ‘ A Disgusted Australian ’ re
the Stinking Fish tactics of a shopman at a local
softgoods store to whom he had applied for a piece
of Victorian tweed and a hat which wasn’t imported.
The writer stated that he was warned against the
tweed on the allegation that it ‘ loses color directly.’
Also the hat—-of a popular Vic. brand—was derided as a
thing which ‘ turns green in the box,’ whereupon the man
in favor of national industries went elsewhere for his;
goods. Assuming that the miserable counter-jumper
in this case was an imported person who cried
‘ Stinking Fish ’ without authority from his bosses,
the fact remains that every retail trader whose interests
are chiefly ‘wrapped up’ in packages of foreign goods
is a natural enemy to the local producers. Moreover,
he is a more dangerous enemy than the wholesale im-
porter, for he has the ear of the purchasing public
and he breathes the doctrines best calculated to
meet his bills. Customers are not likely to hear
any good of Australian manufactures at any shop
which has no considerable connection with local
factories, and which has no business purpose to
serve in creating new demands for Australian products.”
[The Bulletin has heard the same tale in almost the same
words in Sydnev. All the same the editor is pleased to
say that his present suit of Marrickville tweed is holding
out much better than an English-made article that he
recently had to buy in a foreign land, and at £4 15s. it
wasn’t ruinously expensive. But he has been driven to
change his tailor to get away from the moan that Aus-
tralian cloth “ won’t keep its color.”]

A few nicks from “ Ideas for Inventors,” by G.
G. Turri, of Melb. Harvey got £lO,OOO, in one cheque, for
his invention for making aerated water. Norman Miles, the
inventor ofperforatedpostage stamp edges, got £5,000. The
gum at the back brought £4,000 to Jacob Morris, another
inventor. Thousands of pounds await men or women who
can invent something to prevent the unauthorised re-
filling of bottles, a music leaf turner, anti-fraud cheque
book, ditto scrip, anti-fraud envelope, convertible furni-
ture, combined letter-sheets and envelopes, steamship
buffer, safety purses and pocket-books, gas-burner not to
waste, removable leaf ledgers, electric light regulator,
railway ticket cases, cork extractor, ice machine for £2,
stamp'affixers. Turri says he lias in hand an American
automatic telephone. Browne, of Sheffield, a poor cutler’s
apprentice, invented the railway buffers. The money-,
counting machine counts coins and wraps them in pack-
ages. A girl can thus count and wrap 25,000 coins per
hour. Westinghouse, as a mechanic, tried in vain to sell his
brake for £6OO. In 12 years he made out of it £4,000,000.

“Two Seas”: I bought five acres of land at
£3 3s. per acre, and after transfer was completed received
an offer to purchase at £5 per acre. Had the acres been
bullocks I should have jumped at the offer, having no
lawyer to reckon with ; but being land I had to decline to
deal because the cost of transfer had added £2 per acre to
my purchase. I can buy £20,000 worth of beef without
being compelled to call in one of the accursed tribe of
lawyers—but not an acre of land.

Another industry has started in Sydney. A
bottle-oh parades with a hot pie can in his cart, crying
“ ’Ot pies for empty bottles,” and doing a roaring trade.
One hopeful was seen streaking out of the house with a
bottle half-full of pickles. He emptied the pickles into
the gutter before dealing for a hot blob of mystery.

“ Drifter ” : Said “ Bill the Spinner ” “ Two-
up is the fairest game in the world. lam fifty quid
behind it because I haven’t the biains to stick to my
system. No ! It’s simplicity itself! You can work it
either in quids or shillings. F’rinstance, say I have three
quid ? I split it up inter thirty two-bob pieces an’ put it
in a box. That’s my bank. Well, I take two bob each
night. I slip inter the school early as possible—l notice
the raids are generally made with the staff of city traps
that have just been relieved at 10 o’clock —have my bet
and get out lively. Say I win ! That’s four bob. I leave
it on the mat and give it another chance. I win again.
That’s eight. Then again—sixteen. Now I go for the
last—that’s a thirty-two-bob win. Then I’ve got my call.
Four bets running and you win back losses for 15 nights.
If you can’t win four running in fifteen tries it’s because
your luck stinks. Well ! I button up on twenty-five
bob and give the five a chance. You .mustn t be
afraid to bet. When you have a bit of velvet to the
good make it hot. When I win the few quid I make my
mistake. I feel rich and start to knock it down ; have a
night out or so, and p’raps splash into a new suit of
clothes. It goes ; blime ! how it does go ! Then my bank
gets nothing to make up losses. It’s the best system
possible if a man will only stick to it. I have been
studying it for years, and sifted it down to that system
as the best chance. Blime! I’ll be at ’em withitagan
when I raise a few quid ! ” And the sphnner tossed two
invisible coins in the air, and they fell to the floor and
won him an imaginary heap of gold.
THE REJECTED BABY.
[ FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Wanted, a couple without encumbrance.” —Common
advertisement.
“ A baby’s feet, like sea-shells pink.”
So sang the poet.
And mothers used to. read and think,
“ How could lie know it ? ”
Those were the days wh;n babies re'gne f '
Quite undisputed,
For they who the reverse maintained
Were soon confuted.
The stork was sel lom from the door,
The cradle idle.
Falk never thought that having more
Was suicidal. y 1
The creed that taught this course was wise
Is n j .. recanted,
And people boldly advertise
“ Babies not wanted.”
We kneel before the gods of gold,
And sing their praises,
Like Israel in days of oil,
With heart-felt phrases.
We sacrifice the hopes, the dreams,
% Tiie future, maybe ;
The heart, the brain—and now, it seems,
They claim the baby.

“ Two Seas ” on a land-subiect :
,
Here is a point worth noting by intending buyers of
settlement leases. The holder of S.L. taken up before
the new Act can get his term of 28 years extended to 40
years, subject to periodical re-appraisements. A settle-
ment lease .not brought under the 1903 Act must be re-
appraised for the remainder of the 28 years whenever it
is transferred to a new owner. Thus it is worth no more
than the value of the improvements on it, plus its advan-
tages as a going concern. An actual case in point will
show how this works out. A squatter in the North
wished to purchase a S.L. for his son, and the vendor
applied to the Board for the necessaiy permission to
transfer (before the 1903 Act). The land was very good
and the rent low. The price was £2OOO, but they couldn’t,
by any amount of stretching, make the improvements
worth more than £lOOO. It was evident, therefore, that
the buyer was paying £lOOO solely on account of the low
lioUq i h T rfee j >?y Hie State. Had the land been under the
1903 Act and liable for re-appraisement; the price paid by
the buyer would have been evidence in favor of fixing the
rental at double or treble the amount previously placed
upon it. Quite right, too, from the State’s point of view
as landlord. But how different is this re-appraisement of
S.L.’s to the tender treatment meted out to the condi-
tional purchasers when they transfer \ But the big man
is not, as a rule, interested in S.L.’s, which makes all the
difference.

“ Vigilans ” sums up concerning the Terri-
tory which the Commonwealth will have to take
in hand before long :
The true causes of the decadence of the Northern
Territory are “ cumshaw ” —the toll paid by the yellows
to the whites—and dummying for Chows. As long as
these pernicious habits continue the country will
stagnate. Add to these, immense areas held for specula-
tive purposes, and bad management of the mines, and
you have the thing in a nutshell.
Bennet Burleigh on the Japanese, in his
recently published “ Empire of the East, or Japan
and Russia at War, 1904-5” :
The commercial morality of the Japanese is a non-
negotiahle cipher. Ask any British merchant who knows
them, and let him answer. They pirate nearly all our
wares copying them even to the names of the firms and
trade-marks, and unblushingly sell these goods in their
open markets, and foreigners have taken no change out
of their law courts. “ Superior Sheffield cutlery,” “ Hunt-
ley and Palmer’s biscuits,” and “ Hubbuck’s paints,” and
so on, and on ad nauseam. All labelled and trade-
marked, yet but contemptible cheats made without war-
rant in Japan. Shoals of verifying cases can be cited.
And we are, as allies, to take these people at their word,
that they will spend a penny or rally to our aid in the
event of certain contingencies?
“ Squidge,” about a woman :
The brassy cheek of woman passeth all understanding.
I was waiting in a big drapery store in Melbourne, when
a tall, blonde woman strode in, and, with a scornful
glance at the girl behind the counter, demanded “A
knot of white tape ! ” The girl got the tape, wrapped it
up, and made out a bill for onepenee. Then the blonde
lady undid a multitude of purses and bags and extracted
a crossed cheque for £B. This she hurled on the counter,
as if it were a base aspersion which she repudiated with
bitterness. The Miss picked it up and meekly carried it
off to the cashier. Presently she came back. “This
cheque is crossed. You’ll have to endorse it, please,” she
said. But the blonde vision regarded her like Oaesar
looking at a microbe. “ No,” she said, “ I don’t have to
sign. Pa told me it was unnecessary.” She wrangled
over the matter for five minutes, and then grumblingly
affixed her name, got her £7- 19s. lid., did not forget her
knot of tape, and strode out into the street. _Oould a
man have done that ? And if he could, is there a man’s
clothing shop that would put up with him ?
Australia would be a great country if it
had as much grit as it has sand —the grit to pay
for works out of revenue, to tax the loafing land-
lord either out of existence or into activity, and to
put up the Customs tariff high enough to shut out
every foreign article which Australia can make for
itself. In fact, it is because it has so much sand
that it needs this much grit.
“L.P.N.” : A Sunday-school teacher in a
suburban portion of Kalgoorlie was dilating on
the Biblical story of David’s unholy love for Uriah
the Hittite’s wife, and .asked the question : Now
can any of you tell me where Uriah was when
David came to his house and took his wife?”
“On night shift!” replied the son and heir of a
local miner.

WHAT IS CATARRH?
m
MEDICATOR.
Catarrh is inflammation of
the lining 1 membrane of the
nose and adjoining passages.
If this inflammation is not
arrested it invades the pas-
sages which lead from, the
nose to the head, ears, throat
and lungs. It injures the
sight and hearing, destroys
the sense of taste and smell,
renders the breath offensive,
breaks down the affected tis-
sues, consumes the nasal car-
tileges, and rots away the
small frontal bones of the
skull. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and sto-
maoh, causes dyspepsia, also
consumption. Do you want
relief and cure? If so, try
our great remedy.

Too ill to leave his 4iiL
A complete cure.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.
Dear Sir, —I am writing to tell you about the wonderful
cure your medicine has effected in my case. About three
years ago I began to cough. At first the cough was not
severe, but it gradually got worse, and I became very
weak and troubled with night sweats, pain in my chest,
and great quantities of phlegm. On several occasions
there was blood in the expectorated matter. I had been
treated by a doctor, who pronounced my case to be con-
sumption, and various other treatments had been tried,
but without benefit. It was at this stage that I heard of
your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for a course of the
medicine. When it arrived, I was too ill to leave my bed,
but I commenced taking it at once, and gradually im-
proved. I am glad to say that the two lots of medicine
you sent have effected a complete cure, for which accept
my very best thanks. —Yours gratefully,

The Ballad of Mary.
[ FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HER rose-leaved progress held a throng
Of men who strove her smiles to win ;
The world rejoiced in wine and song
That Mary came to help it sin.
The Euxine knew her love succinct;
To madness was Massilia hurled
Before her passion ; so she linked
A chain of kisses round the world.
Stern Sparta fell, its curbs forswore
To gratify her ways and whims;
Cold Corinth’s marble glowed before
The fire that moved her lips and limbs.
The silken vows of Athens earned
The sweet dominion of her thrall;
With summer fervor she returned
The rude embraces of the Gaul.
To her each haughty captain bare
His head, to patient wait her beck
And wind her strands of amber hair
As shackles round his willing neck.
By poets round the tideless sea
In passioned verse her praise was sung ;
She paid their alien minstrelsy
In love that talks in every tongue.
Where domes of mighty temples shone.
The priests ignored their gods’ behests
To offer votive kisses on
The domes that were her gleaming breasts.
One day the stadium saw her woo
Some gladiator bold and brown,
With teasing chase until he threw
His net to bring her laughing down.
The next, her blue mesmeric eyes
Hose to the consul’s throne above,
Or thrilled some chief, to signalise
The great democracy of love.
Gay, irresponsible and free,
Capricious as the warming wind,
Whose rhythmic ripples swayed the sea,
Impenitent she sinned and sinned.
At last, the world grew dull and dead,
The homing instinct burst to fire,
What time her seaman lover spread
His painted sails and steered for Tyre.
They decked the deck with flaming blooms,
Iresh plucked from every wondrous port,
on rugs from Persia’s looms
Throughout that voyage, all too short.
A lover pilot dashed to wade
Ashore beneath a precious load ;
A lover soldier gladly made
Her escort on the troublous road.
With laughing eyes, content, elate,
In radiant garb and flashing gem,
She urged her steed, and passed the gate,
The gate of old Jerusalem.
Soon joined a merry Pagan crowd
To seek her aid the priests to tease,
With ribald mirth and laughter loud
They mocked the canting Pharisees.
When, through the casement, morning crept
To paint her shining tresses gold,
The jaded sinners snored and slept
’Midst where the spent amphoras rolled.
So passed the days in joyous sin
Until, by tedium overcome,
They sought the squalid stews wherein
A Preacher led the city’s scum.
They vied in banter to deride
Those pale, pure, peaceful pioneers,
And saw not Mary at their side
Unsmiling, silent, through their jeers.
Her eyes were on the Preacher’s eyes,
Hungered her ears for every word,
Her heart was fighting to surmise
What meant the doctrines strange she heard.
With scoffing tired, her comrades passed
To seek fresh spirits like their own ;
But Mary, watching to the last,
Listened and left and dreamed alone.
She passed from out the Pagan view ;
None felt the circle of her arms ;
Her lovers found them lovers new,
And sin itself lost half its charms.
They mourned her lost, but toiled in stealth
And found her home, alone, apart,
But neither courage, wit nor wealth
Nor manliness could tempt her heart.
Their revelry no more she knew ;
Her torrid heart seemed hard and cold ;
The memories all hateful grew
Of fiery night-long loves of old.
But where the Preacher’s puzzling text
Was spoken, Mary found her place ;
(She cared not how His words perplexed
So she might gaze upon His face.
The love that once entranced the earth
With largesse, boundless, wanton, wild,
Had gathered to reveal its worth
And centre on the Preacher mild.
Yet loveliness, that once had brought
Upon their knees the leaders famed,
Drew from the Preacher not the thought
The beggar and the leper claimed.
She spoke. Upon the dusty street,
Pulsating, cast her body fair ;
Devoted, blind, she washed His feet
And dried them with her golden air.
Unmoved, the glance she cast above,
He saw. She shrank as from a knife,
To hear Him grant, instead of love,
The bauble of Eternal Life.
No score of sins did slie compound ;
Relentless, the atonement ran ;
Through life she wept that she had found
A God when she had sought a man.

A Night in the East.
[ FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE most interesting personage I met in
London was a sandwich-man. I met
him in Cranbourne-street; a starved little
fellow with twinkling eyes that lost the twinkle
when I talked “fog,” and he thought of a chil-
blained December. Fashionable London talks
Rome and Cairo and Palermo and the Riviera
then; but for the sandwich-man the winter means
nine hours a day of rheumatism and chills, and
walking in gutter-slush. Sunday weather is
notoriously the best of the week, but on those
days he must not walk, because church people
object to reading on a sandwich - board that
“Bertie’s Baking Powder Assassinates Bugs,”
though they do not mind the statement on a
permanent hoarding.
There are 2500 sandwich-men in London —all
failures, for this is the last job on earth—the dead
finish. They get 7s. a week for six days—if the
day begins in rain they lose the day and its
precious fourteenpence. (Seven shillings is the
fixed rate—they will never get above it, they will
never find better occupation, and they must never
beg.
It was seeing him that started me on that night
of horror in the East—-a night of blue-handed,
leprous, white-faced people, of grey, vile-smelling
shadows, of men and women moving furtively in
the fog—a phantasmagoria of misery.
We had dined at a club in Northumberland
Avenue—a place loaded with nightmare marbles ;
the stair-columns in pork-brawn, and the balus-
trade of imitation Roquefort cheese ; and after that
there was some happy and unwise drinking at
every club and pub. in Fleet-street; so that at 11
o’clock I was listening to an old match-woman’s
troubles in Wine Office Court, and at five minutes
past 11 was dancing a saraband with the afore-
said old woman in the rain of Fleet-street. A
policeman moved on my partner, although he had
no objection to my dancing, as I wore the tall
hat of a blameful life. With a fine, vinous
hatred of this injustice, the Anti-Christian—who
was my friend from Australia, via Barcelona,
Cordoba, Cadiz, and Ayr, and had whistled the
music for the dance—and myself, determined to
go East, and see how the poor lived.
It was a crowded night of unhappy experiences—
everywhere the leper-faced people, and the stench
of poverty. Billingsgate has lost its one-time dis-
tinctive bad language—the people I saw there
were too cold to swear. A night of horror it was
—yet with much sardonic humor in it; a night of
tramping from beer-shop to beer-shop in Shore-
ditch, Whitechapel and Bethnal Green, attended
by a retinue as ragged as Falstaff’s army; that
pretended to follow us because it liked us, but
really pursued us for the long still dank cold
mysterious penny beers we paid for, with some-
thing that looked like death at the bottom of
every pot. This, of course, was not moral
philanthropy—we were merely curious and not
philanthropic, and as we two could not hope to
regenerate these awful millions, the next kindest
thing was to give to a score or so of the homeless
ones nepenthe for a night.
Old Petticoat Lane, we found, had converted
itself to Middlesex-street, and Ratcliffe Highway
is St. George’s-road; but there are others —Went-
worth-street and Dorset-street, for instance, and
the pen halts at these.
All that night a bulky man in morning dress,
and a slighter man in tweeds, penetrated the
rabbit-runs in that great warren of dingy brick,
followed by the Legion of the Damned.
It was a brave night, and dawn found us very
merry. But the dawn brought little difference to
the atmosphere—all objects were indefinite as if
they were reflections in a dim glass.
We were in the city at dawn, but at seven
o’clock we crossed to Surrey yet again, and met
thousands of work-girls on the way to slavery.
And life seemed such a fine thing that with the
best intentions in the world I stopped the traffic
and said to the girls—nearly all of them white-
faced, and some of them pretty :
“ Where are you going, girls ?”
“Gawnter wairk, mister.”
“Not to-day—let there be one merry day.
Come with me, any fifty of you, and we’ll go to
Chingford and see some trees.’’
Some laughed and went on. Others frowned
and ran away. One pretty one—her prettiness
making her more suspicious than the others—
said :
“You mi-end whatcher sayin’; I’ll tell the
p’leece.”
This calling the p’leece seems to be their one
stand-by—although the calling of him would have
been futile. Why these suspicions ? Surely we
had made our innocence patent by inviting fifty
of them. Otherwise we must have appeared as
whales in sheep’s clothing.
Back to the city and into Whitechapel again.
The time was but half-past seven; yet three
women, two of them with an emaciated baby
apiece in arms, were drinking beer in a noisome
public-house. When the children cried they were
given sips of beer to “ keep them good.” We left
that “public” and walked for twenty minutes
through dark wastes of houses, built of the gloomy
London brick. There were women everywhere—
drunken, bleared women ; old baggy women,
waddling agglomerations of fat; women with
horrible pouchy faces, pendent chins like dewlaps,
cheeks like bacon flitches. And children every-
where, and not one happy, well-cared-for child
among the lot.
As if to give a jocularity to all this bitterness,
an organ-grinder around the corner began to play
“Home, Sweet Home,” and the children rushed
to him and we followed. After he had
played twenty bars of that dreary, fraudulent
song, which suggests that roaming ’mid pleasures
and palaces has not half the joys that “Home”
has, even in Whitechapel, the joke became too
horrible, and I stopped the man and bade him
play something lively, and in two minutes all the
little girls of the gutter were footing it to the tune
of “Susie” from “ The Girl up There.” “Grand-
father’s Clock ” is wildly hilarious compared with
a moral atrocity like “ Home, Sweet Home.”
The organ-grinder was one of the most miser-
able wretches I have ever seen. His face was as
white and weak and despairing as that of a
criminal I saw hanged at Ballarat in 1891, and
he had wept himself dry, and had taken two days
to do it.
In such a place as the East End of London
the poverty is so terrible that it prompts
strange shifts, which from their mere unexpected-
ness would be funny if they were not so tragic.
Therefore imagine the poverty of the people who
provide poverty with its music and its art.
So there is a lower depth than the last deep.
These people are all more or less inside the starva-
tion-line. What life was possible to this organ-
grinder, who offered luxury to people who are
mostly unable to buy the indispensable? His
position in the depth was best illustrated by the
fact that here he was, at seven of a foggy morn-
ing, beginning his day in the Four Streets of
Poverty—Hunger, Cold, Waiting, and Con-
tumelj.
He was not the only representative of the fine
arts in the street. A little further on, before a
public-house, its lighted bars trying to banish the
morning darkness, two draggle-tailed young
women with violins, and a weary little man with
a flute, were playing “The Honeysuckle and the
Bee,” with much pathos. They told us that they
started out at six every morning; and we asked
them to drink.
The man ordered “gin hot with,” whatever
that may be. The ladies very genteely asked for
“Pork wine.”
“What wine?” said I.
“Pork Wine.”
“Port Wine?” That was for the pleasure of
hearing them say it again.
“Yes, please—Pork Wine.”
There appears to be a big class in London that
cannot pronounce its t’s.
The fog thinned into a moist haze, and, restless
and tireless, we crossed the river again.
At 9 o’clock we were at a boot-cleaner’s box on
the Surrey side of the river, having our patent
leathers made beautiful before venturing to
Piccadilly, and our pale retinue was with us still.
A policeman came and put them all aside as if
they were yesterday’s Times, saying, “ Move on
there —move on there. Have you never seen
two gentlemen drunk before.” At that, finding
our disguise had been penetrated, we distributed
largesse and drove from the miasma of Surrey into
the fog of Middlesex.
Later, I visited Islington and all the sordidness
of North London, to assure myself that all the
poverty is not in the East; but nightmares are
unpleasant to remember.
How anybody can be sufficiently callous to sing
“Rule Britannia” in the midst of this awful
English poverty, I know not ; but to do the
English justice, the blasphemous anthem is sung
mostly by German Jews. Almost every day I
read in newspapers of families sleeping six in a
room—bare of furniture. There was a case yes-
terday of a family of nine, who had lived on bread
and water for many months ; the father had been
workless for seven months; one of the seven
children was dying of consumption, and a new
baby was expected.
Five million people in England and Wales are
in receipt of charitable relief —over ten million
are within the starvation mark. Eight thousand
landlords receive in rents £3s,ooo,ooo—the rents
of 580 peers amount to £14,000.000; and 35,000
men hold all the land against a population of over
40,000,000. And the average Englishman is callous
to all this.
“Don’t give her anything,” said a very respec-
table householder of Bloomsbury to me as I helped
a beggar-woman. “ You mustn’t encourage them.
I pay my poor-rates—and there’s the workhouse.”
But the workhouse is only gaol.
I found the last straw in a pawnbroker’s window
near Aldgate; and the last straw was a great bowl
filled with sets of false teeth, offered for sale as
“ great bargains.” The Teeth of the Dead ! Ugh !

0®“ Mailed Free, “ How to Cure livery Humour.”
Rheumatic and Qouty Affections.
(Br “Origin.”)
The unnatural retention of uric acid and other urinary and biliary poisons in the blood produces a
group of complaints which inflict upon humanity long continued suffering and intense pain. The
most common of these complaints are rheumatism, gout, lumbago, sciatica, and neuralgia. The kid-
neys and liver are the organs upon which Nature has imposed the task of extracting from the blood
certain matter which is being continuously manufactured in the body, owing to the wasting of the
tissues. It is as necessary to life that the wasting of the tissues must proceed uninterruptedly as it is
that the substance of the body must be regularly renewed by the food we eat, the water we drink, and
the air we breathe. It is equally necessary to health that the waste matter should be expelled from
the body continuously, for its presence in the blood entails disease or death.
The treatment of rheumatic and gouty affections by the outward application of liniments, oint-
ments and embrocations is seldom productive of much lasting benefit. They may afford temporary
relief in some cases, but they do not reach the seat of the disorder. The only way in which health can
be permanently restored, and pain permanently removed, is to take measures to ensure the regular
action of the kidneys and the liver. When these organs are performing-their allotted task naturally
and freely, the uric acid, and other urinary and biliary poisons, pass from the system through the
ordinary channels, and any suffering caused by the presence of such poisons in the blood is at an end.
Owing to its specific action, Warner’s Safe Cure, every moment during the past twenty-five years,
has been demonstrating its remarkable power of restoring' the kidneys and liver to health and activity.
Warner’s Safe Cure not only cures Bright’s Disease and other specific diseases of those vital organs,
but rheumatism, gout, gravel, stone, bladder troubles, indigestion, biliousness, anaemia, impure blood,
and all disorders caused by the retention in the system of urinary and biliary poisons, speedily yield
to the influence of the medicine, simply because of its healing and stimulating influence upon the
kidneys and liver. Cures thus effected are permanent, simply because they are natural.
A simple test to make as to whether the kidneys are healthy is to place some urine, passed the
first thing in the morning, in a covered glass, and let it stand until next morning. If it is then
cloudy, shows a sediment like brick-dust, is of an unnatural color, or has particles floating about in i,t
the kidneys are weak or diseased, and steps must immediately be taken to restore their vigor, or
Bright’s Disease, Diabetes, or some of the many manifestations of uric poisoning will result. [2.

The Song of the Earth Spirit.
[ FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN the field of the far heaven changes
Through the day’s broken bars,
O’er the peaks of the mystical ranges
I arise with the stars.
But I pass in a wreath o’ white vapor
When the shadows are done,
Where the arms of the sloping hills taper
To the reach of the sun.
All the wild winds are huddled together,
Lying low in their lair;
Falls the down of a lone eagle’s feather
Like a stone in the air.
Oh, Beloved ! my bosom is dreary
As the lilt of a song,
When the heart of the singer is weary,
And the rhythm is long.
Thy somnolent voice as I listen,
O’er the leagues of the turf
Floats to me, and white thy limbs glisten
On the crest of the surf.
Is there aught neath the wide sky’s embowment
Like thy mighty unrest ?
Oh, to lean for one lingering moment
On thy turbulent breast!
How I long for thy waters to hold me
As they lap at my feet,
To flow over and fondle and fold me
Till our joy be complete !

LOLA RIDGE.
A Study in Slops.
[ FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT is week-end. We—wives long familiar-
ised with the formula “’e ain’t workin’,”
and makers of stock garments for Mrs.
Dunn and the warehouse —drive our machines
furiously.
With fingers almost under the needle, we cram
the feeder’s greedy maw with “parts.” A leap of
the machine, an instant’s thunderous whirring, a
dexterous twist or two, and the oddly-shaped
“pieces” of common print emerge, transformed
into fashionable sleeves and “ cross-overs,” ready
for “ putting in.”
Twining round our feet are strings of belts —to
the uninitiated, hopelessly entangled with other
strings of yokes, cuffs, and trimmings.
Out of this seeming confusion we will evolve
garments, cheap and tasteful, and, at a glance,
well and truly made. It is the buyers who will
prove them the shams they are and reveal the
rottenness of the stitching, the lonely thread that
has the entire responsibility of the button, and that
shameless mockery, the button-hole. The arm-
hole’s agonising grip and the draughty amplitude
of the neck they will also view with sorrow.
These things concern us not. Sufficient to know
that we are “in a rush” and have no time for
niceties.
In the kitchen-dining-room, where we work,
Muddle sits enthroned. The dusty floor is
covered with clippings, the shoddy suite heaped
with “ stock.” Every corner has its rolls of uncut
prints f every wall its paper patterns. Sus-
pended from hooks hang ill-cut specimens of
our handicraft in the shape of dressing-gowns
calculated to render even a Juno ungainly.
The “what-not,” its photos and nick-nacks
prone, is swamped under goods ready and waiting
for the carrier, who tarrieth.
Mrs. Dunn, also working at high pressure, folds
and completes the dozens. The screech of tearing
calico cleaves the air. In the scullery the magpie
hoarsely croaks and demands provender.
Mrs. Dunn lacks method. She seldom “tidies
up,” and I suspect the week’s dishes are done simul-
taneously with the week’s washing on the Day of
Rest. At present the table bears squalid remains
of breakfast. The loaf has unmistakably been rent
in twain, the saucers each have had a generous
overflow, the cloth a liberal baptism, and every-
where is evidence that the breakfasters have
“ pigged ” in haste.
Space being needed for the work, the remnants
of the feast have been pushed nearer and nearer
the table’s edge, thereby jeopardising the crockery,
also the melancholy cruet, the daily appearance of
which is purely a matter of form, for the most
sanguine never expect to extract condiments from
its bottles. .
Seated on the sofa, amid crumbs, pms and pat-
terns, a cute little girl, Mrs. Dunn’s Gladys,
nimbly sews on tickets, and gives her mother
much gratuitous advice. From the pantry, black
from a sojourn among the saucepans, the lodger’s
baby crawls. . . , .
His mother is busy preparing her mother for the
weekly visit to the hospital. Down the stair
floats the invalid’s indignant protest against the
bath, an inhuman ordeal prescribed by the doctor,
and the only blot on an otherwise enjoyable out-
ing.. “ They ’ave no ’eart,” she shrills, “arskin’ a
person o’ my years to strip this bitter weather.
My Gord, it’ll gimme death, so it will.”
That Mrs. Dunn is no Feter, to deny her Lord,
the texts adorning the walls (framed in pmk
muslin, the property of the warehouse), and
mostly swaying by one pin, abundantly testify.
On the lodger hurrying down for mother’s stock-
ings, left drying in the oven, she is expostulated
with concerning mother’s language. “ Not that I
want to be ’ard,” says Mrs. Dunn, “for I’m a
widder myself, but I’m a registered factory, and
as such should ’ave respeck.” “Lor,” replies the
lodger, “she don’t mean no ’arm ; it’s an ’abit of
’ers” I b’lieve she’s light-’eaded meself. A fair
noosance she’s gettin’—wish th orspital d take
ei She hurries upstairs, and Mrs. Dunn turns
again to the folding, threatens the supercilious
Gladys with the flat-iron, and takes the last pin
from “Thou art my staff,” which slithers silently
behind the safe, there to lie till next cleaning day.
From upstairs come squeals of “My Gord,
mind my laig !”
Amid the heat and hurry and rush Mrs. Dunn,
now cutting, now folding, always talking, keeps
up an intermittent search, peculiar to the week-
end, for an odd blouse, mislaid, and now needed
to complete the order.
She makes raids on our work, up-ending the
piles of “pieces,” searching distractedly in im-
possible places, such as the machine-drawers or
the meat-safe, even insisting that we all stand up
several times to prove that we are not sitting on
it. Needless to say, ice are blamed for its disap-
pearance, and she threatens all and sundry with
the “bag.” But, knowing that her bark is worse
than her bite, we have little fear of her bitterness.
When she becomes too eloquent, we defend our-
selves by drowning her voice in the roar of our
machines.
Always in a hurry, her unbuttoned boots
clopping, Mrs. Dunn runs everywhere with in-
elegant bobbing steps that get her “no forrader.”
A knock at the door announcing a probable
dun, she runs to open it. She also runs into the
sharp edge of the hall-stand en route, whilst
chanting a commentary on the slackness of trade
and the scarcity of money, intended to warn the
tax-gatherer that her pocket is empty.
Her precautions are wasted, however. It is no
claimant for cash, merely a poor out-door “hand,”
who, sodden with rain and sullen with labor, is
now made to “sit up” over her unpunctuality.
“ Oh, Mrs. What-is-it, what a hour to bring
those suits. You noo they was wanted. What-
ever kep’ you ? What yer say ? Didn’t tell yer
they was wanted ? Well, I thought you ’ad the—
what is it ? ’’—(“Nous ” suggests Gladys). “ Yes,”
resumes her mother, catching the word imper
fectly, “ the mouse to know that, any’ow.”
We save the “hand” from further questioning
by a concerted roar of the machines, and Mrs.
Dunn grumbles on, unheeded.
“Any’ow, it’s me pays the thingumbob,” she
says. “ ’Ow’m Ito get to the ware’ouse ? ” (glanc-
ing at a clock with but one hand) “ and the
carrier late, and the pressing not done, and”—
here she runs for the iron, and, forgetting her
religious scruples, cries, “Damn that fire, it’s
going out again, and the 4 woody ’ not bin. ’ She
charges vindictively at the embers. The poker
leaves its smutty trail on her fingers, to be pre-
sently transferred to the pile of “ nights ” she is
folding.
Anxious to propitiate, and to divert attention
from her own shortcomings, the “ hand” casually
remarks that “ that woody won’t give more’n a
week’s tick to nobody.” The ruse is not success-
ful. Mrs. Dunn’s temper, being of the quality
that swallows camels all the week and strains at
gnats on Friday, takes offence at what she regards
as a slur on her solvency.
So the “hand,” realising that danger is in the
air, sulkily submits without further parley certain
show pieces for inspection. Luck is clearly against
her, for Mrs. Dunn, spitefully on the alert, rejects
these and pounces upon 'others that, for reasons of
her own, the “hand” had been trying to keep
dark. Mrs. Dunn’s zeal is rewarded by finding
these shamelessly “slopped.” Lop-sided garments
they are, suitable perhaps for nightmares, and of
a cut that will never “set” on mortal boy, and
she almost weeps as she sees that the unwritten
law that demands an appearance at least of good
workmanship has been wholly ignored.
Taking up one of the suits she now appears in
the character of a homely magician. A smart
shake of it produces a shower of little gilt buttons.
At a touch of her smutty fingers collars fall
asunder, and anchors leave their moorings, while
at one glance of her magic eye a luxuriant crop of
tags and machine oil appears as by a miracle.
She raves dismally of the wrath to come when
the ware’ouse shall have cast its eye on such
botches, orders the “hand” to smooth things
over as best she can, and, jawing still, turns again
to the fire.
Gingerly she opens a cupboard, the shelves of
which are running over with a heterogeneous
collection of odds and ends. Careful as she is,
most of the contents seize the opportunity to
slide out and deposit themselves on the floor.
From out the muddle she extracts a cake of fire-
kindlers, stands it on the embers, adds a generous
toss of kerosene, leans the iron against the flame,
and leaves it to its fate.
The lodger who, if she had “her rights,”
would be Mrs. Higgs, comes down to curl her
hair.
She takes sides, silently with the embittered
“hand,” who, still smarting under rebuke, winks
at the expense of the employer of labor. That
lady’s back being towards them, Mrs. Higgs in-
dulges in insulting gesture, and points a derisive
finger at the skimpy coverings of Mrs. Dunn’s
bulging limbs. Upon Gladys observing her
manoeuvres, the finger of derision becomes one of
admonition pointed at the unoffending baby, as
he appears momentarily at the pantry door, and
so, through sheer presence of mind, the situation
is saved. .
It grows late, and we are all pressed into
service as folders.
Mrs. Dunn clumps round giving orders, putting
finishing touches and still looking for the blouse.
“ The carrier ’ll soon be ’ere now, Mrs. ’lggs,”
she says. “You better get ’er down. ’E’s
always in a devil of a ’urry.”
Mrs. ’lggs sees the wisdom of this advice, and
presently the invalid is lowered by the aid of
many hands. Her gigantic white limbs appear-
ing, as it seems, from space nearly deprive baby of
his reason, and it is not till they are followed by
the familiar garments, spotted bonnet and bleached
sheep face that constitute the “ gammer ” he
knows, that he breathes again.
Mrs. Dunn, running, dressing and improvising
a pair of garters simultaneously, becomes “that
faint ” as to necessitate the outlay of threepence
on a glass of ale (per Gladys), a purchase highly
commended by Gammer, till seeing Mrs. Dunn
drink it on her own in the scullery, she piously
gives thanks that she is not greedy.
Gladys, always on the watch, tells of the car-
rier’s approach. And her mother, buoyed up by
beer, defies any but an angel to find the missing
blouse and consigns it to perdition, and the red-
faced carrier entering just then she has perforce
to abandon the search.
He seizes the monster parcels and heaves them
into the van. He returns for Gammer, who has
been towed up the passage. What inducement
she has offered for the lift I know not. Sufficient
that with many groans and prayers for her “laig’s”
safety she is safely hoisted, and with a wild cry
she disappears into the interior.
Mrs. Higgs, donning a hat like a racecourse,
smilingly and nimbly mounts beside the driver.
“Look at ’er,” ironically remarks the “hand.”
“You’d think she was Lady’Opeton—an ad a
’usband,” she adds aggrievedly.
In the doorway Mrs. Dunn mumbles good-byes
over her false teeth, and, pinning on her hair as
she stands, watches them drive off in triumph.
The little excitement is over. We return to
our slavery. T _
Shortly afterwards a juvenile Mrs. Dunn,
stayed, busked and buttoned, runs away to the
warehouse, and we are left alone.
The “ hand ” referring bitterly to Mrs. Dunn’s
rakish appearance, wonders “’ow she does it.”
Then she takes pity on the baby, “ deserted, pore
child,” rummages in the cot for his clothing, and
brings forth the missing blouse.
WEEROONA.
Liver Trouble
A GREAT SUFFERER CURED.
A DISORDERED LIVER, if not attended to, very often brings in
its train serious results. The stomach, the digestive organs, and
the kidneys become lax in their duties. Pimples and blotches
appear, and the complexion generally assumes a nasty sallow tint. A 1
the svmptoms of Liver Disorder are too numerous to mention, but the
most common are pains in the back, especially after eating, diffieu t-y in
breathing, a general feeling of depression and discontent, and loss ot
appetite. A Disordered Liver needs to be corrected in a natural and
easy manner, and not by taking strong
purgatives, mineral salts, and other
injurious preparations. The finest
natural vegetable remedy known to
medical science in this century is Bile
Beans for Biliousness. They cure all
disorders of the liver quite easily and
naturally. They also cure permanently
by righting first causes; and for this
reason there is absolutely nothing else
that is “just as good.” As a striking

headaches and body pains. I was constantly retching and could not
retain any food. At times I would become faint and giddy, and
altogether unable to attend to my household duties, and my life was
quite a misery to me. A friend advised me tq try Bile Beans, which 1
did. From the first dose I began to improve in health, and by the time
I had used two small boxes, I was my old self again. lam now able
to enjoy my food, and housework is a pleasure to me, for which I
am indeed grateful.”

“Some time ago I had a very
severe attack of influenza which
left me greatly weakened. I lost
flesh rapidly, and was in a very
bad way. I took quantities of
medicine, but grew constantly
worse. Finally, I tried Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla, and began to im-
prove from the start.
“I took about six bottles and
was perfectly cured. I have used
this remedy in my family a great
deal and I know it to be a thor-
oughly reliable, health-giving
compound and family medi-
cine.”
Mr. John Murrell, railway
station master, of Sunnybank,
Queensland, sends ns this letter, together with his photograph, which
we reproduce above.
This is a strong letter, one which must remove all doubt. You
ought to profit by it greatly; for if you are weak, have lost flesh, are
without appetite, and feel languid and depressed, here is a quick and
certain cure.
Perhaps the trouble is with your blood, and you are suffering from
headache, boils, eruptions of the skin, scrofula, or rheumatism. If
you are suffering from weakness of any kind, Ayer’s Sarsaparilla will
restore to you strength and energy, and will make life the better
worth living. Be sure you get
AYER’S Sarsaparilla
There are a great many substitute Sarsaparfllas on the market that will ditajp
point you. Avoid imitations.

WILFLEY v. CARD CONCENTRATOR.
N
The judgment in the recent law suit does not apply to the original Card Concentrator, but only to two experimen al
Table Tops that were made for the purpose of trial during the absence of Mr. Guthridge from Australia, and before
the working of the Table was properly understood. We are, therefore, continuing the manufacture and sale of these
machines, and the mining industry will not be deprived of this valuable invention. According o e sworn evi ence,
the “ Card” has 50 per cent. “ greater capacity and makes higher concentrates and poorer tailings than the Wiltley.
With the * Card ' there is practically no loss of lead (mineral), as there is with the Wilney. . , ,
The “ Card ” Table may be seen on application, when evidence of its great superiority will be lurnishea.
