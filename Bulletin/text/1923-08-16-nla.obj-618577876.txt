Interesting Poetry
John Middleton Murry, in his new maga-
zine, the Adelphi, says that the poems he
will publish must have as much interest as
a good short story. The statement is a little
indefinite, as it is not quite clear to whom
they are to provide the measure of interest re-
quired. If to the editor, it is well; if to a
general public of the editor’s conceiving, not
so well; but, in any case, it is an indication
of a certain modern feeling which deserves
consideration. A great bulk of rather fine
poetry which is only of interest to its writer
has* appeared during the last 30 or 40 years,
poetry in which the reader discovers the
exquisite line, phrase or stanza, and has
barely time to become enthusiastic before he
makes the further discovery that the poem,
as a whole, is almost meaningless, because
he does not possess the key. Such verse has
grown up with the knowledge of the writer
that he is almost without an audience. He
has got into the habit of making verse for
his own pleasure or as a means of self-expres-
sion, a self-expression as indefinite to his
readers as his own shadow on a mountain
cloud-bank. Writing with no view of moving
other men, he sets down things that may
mean much or little to his own mind ; but the
references are lost, the sequence is impossible
to follow, and the work becomes no more
than a pattern of words —a pattern suggest-
ing vivid things but failing to give them
definition. Of course, since work of this
kind, with its appearance of thought so high
that it is practically unintelligible, first be-
gan to appear, there has been a flood of work
intentionally obscure. When a certain type
of reader cannot make head or tail of a
thing he is apt to call it great; and so noisy
but small reputations have grown up on what
theologians would call obscurantism. But
the cult of writing for no readers, though
often based on very sincere self-deception, is
proved to be worthless by the eagerness of
writers to publish their work. If it is written
for the author’s eyes alone, why is it not
kept for those eyes alone? The answer usu-
ally given is that the writer fancies there are
a few minds exactly like his own and is glad
to establish a fellowship with these; but such
an answer is not very convincing.
The fact seems to stand out plainly enough
that the poet is either trying to say some-
thing or not. If he is trying to say some-
thing he is trying to say it to somebody;
for the habit which some men actually form
of talking to themselves is reasonably enough
regarded as swerving a trifle from the track
of sanity. Consider the superb egotism of
the poet who will produce large volumes of
verse, see them carefully through the press
and offer them for review when he declares
that they are written for himself alone!
Is it too much to think that the humanity
which gives life to poetry must be lacking
when the man fills so large a place in his own
mental vision? Speech is a social thing ; and
poetry, the rhythmic essence of the best
speech, must surely be a social thing also.
So the idea of interesting poetry is. in the
right direction; and the depth of its interest
for the best minds is probably the final gauge
of its value. The raw-public, which is quite
outside the range of the. best in literature,
makes no doubt about its feelings in the
matter. It passes over feeble and hackneyed
rhymes about the Spring and sea-shells and
the love that died in pleasant suburban draw-
ing-room fashion and accepts the crude and
hackneyed verse that will make a recitation,
because to make a recitation it must con-
tain something of story interest. Lift the
same idea to the higher plane, and .imme-
diately the breadth and scope of a poem—
which account for its interest —mark it out
as the thing worth while. In a general way
it may be regarded as something like an
axiom' that the poem will live longest which
appeals to the widest circle of really appre-
ciative minds ; and as those most apprecia-
tive minds are generally the after-poets of
distant generations, it may be said that the
interest of poets is the thing most to be
sought by the poet. So in setting “interest”
as his standard John Middleton Murry, him-
self a poet, is probably doing much more for
his contributors than those who, without any
standard, look only for the freakish and
bizarre in verse.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
The Decline and Fall of the Novel
“If Winter Comes” has deepened my
respect for the literary style of famous novel-
ists who were contemporary with hackney-
coaches in England, and who died before the
telephone bell announced the arrival of a
civilisation which now threatens to destroy
itself. The appeal of Dickens and his dis-
ciples was to the sympathies of the whole
reading world and to intelligent listeners
among the illiterate. Thackeray and his
immediate imitators, of whom Anthony Trol-
lope was the leader, appealed mainly to the
cultured classes, yet their aim, like that of
the Dickens school, was to be easy to read
and free from affectation. The masters
never concentrated on the character of one
particular man or woman, hero or heroine.
They wasted no space on wordy analyses of
individual feelings and motives. Dialogue and
plain narrative of incidents were left to tell
all there could be to tell about sentiments
and emotions which in a book like A. S. M.
Hutchinson’s best seller are under continual
consideration. In such a chapter as “The
Lion and the Jackal” in “The Tale of Two
Cities” you get in a few lines of dialogue
everything that matters explanatory of the
relations between sentimental Sydney Carton
and Stryver, the coarse-grained King’s Bench
barrister. Where is so meaty a cliapter to be
found in the work of any follower of George
Meredith —an analytical chemist in character
study who devoted hundreds of lines to the
personality of a well-bred Egoist? No wire-
drawn characterisations can be charged
against the great bygone novelists. Their
creations, after 50 years of exposure to public
observation, are accepted types of humanity.
One can say of Dickens and Thackeray and
their detractors what Chesterton said of
Alexander Pope and the minor poets of to-
day, whose devoted readers profess to despise
the 18th-century master of the rhyming
couplet. A little piece of any of the mid-
Victorian best books of fiction contains good
stuff enough for a modern writer to make
into a whole novel.
And these men who put so much into their
stories were anxious to attract the reader
with an inviting style. Thackeray, to be
sure, was not the honest follower of Smollett
that Dickens was, and sometimes his paren-
thetical mannerism made him rather tire-
some, but there never was any striving after
oddity in his method of telling a story. Had
he ventured to tell it in epistolary form, as
“Humphrey Clinker” is told, he would not
have varied the design. In “If Winter
Comes” the novelist starts by talking in the
capacity of an alleged lawyer (with the wit
of a smart commercial traveller intent on
being funny when ladies are present), and
subsequently he tells the tale as coming from
himself. He mixes things, with the result
that the reader’s closest attention is required
rather than commanded ; wherefore some read-
ers refuse to be bothered to understand the
book.
But what chiefly turned my thoughts to
the “old fashioned” novelists (whose fashion
has never become obsolete) was the unreality
of the world Mark Sabre lived in. There
was only a glaze of deception on the face of
things. The clean-minded, well-meaning hero
was impossibly incapable of adapting his
brains to the circumstances of the case.
Traddles, the friend of David Copperfield,
was a sane edition of Sabre, and doubtless he
often thought about the wonders of creation
and the injustice of civilised society. But
Dickens didn’t beguile the public into attach-
ing a fictitious importance to his dear old
puzzlehead. Mark Sabre is really an incred-
ible person in commonplace clothing, as essen-
tially false to life, in his position, as is
Ibsen’s hero in “An Enemy of the People.”
Criticism of his mild insanity can be summed
up in the words of the “Iledda Gabler”
character, “But people don’t do such things.”
Certain conditions preclude the possibility
of certain things being done under them.
The reader does not believe in any of A.
S. M. Hutchinson’s characters as he believes
in all of Dickens’s. The church-furnishing
business in a provincial town, or village, or
suburb, or wherever it was that Mark
worked on impossible terms of incompati-
bility with his partners, was not a real busi-
ness. High and Low Jinks, the cook and
housemaid, only bore their names in order
that Mark might work off his little joke on
them. The Perch family, mother and son,
were christened for the same reason. An
interchange of cattishness between Nona and
her husband’s other girl, when she rejoined
them after staying an hour or two in Mark’s
private office, was, all social circumstances
considered, an incredible outcome of an
extraordinary happening. The other cat was
supposed to comment on a pulpit in a shop
window. Did anyone ever see a pulpit in a
provincial warehouse windows?
E. F.
James Branch Cabell
Just about the time when a high American
critic held an inquest on the literature of
the Southern States and gave a verdict of
suicide while insane, a man of culture and
modest bearing, who had lived and studied
in old Virginia, came to light with a book
called “Jurgen.” The man’s name was
James Branch Cabell, and the high Ameri-
can critic, poised ready for a sniff at this
exhibition of Southern daring, decided to
read the volume and see what the stranger
had to say. It would be an understatement
to declare that the critic was surprised. He
was enchanted, and his appreciation, couched
in vivid sentences and alight with the radi-
ance of a newfound pleasure, was all the
richer for a subtle note of foreboding regard-
ing his own critical perspicuity. To Cabell,
who had languished for 20 years, pierced by
shafts of heavy ridicule from lesser men, the
approval of the big fellow was a salute. He
was naturally touched, and felt that it would
not now be longer than two decades when
he would be lined up by the professors in
the annual medal-scatter with the current
Henry Sydnor Harrison, the latest Zane Grey
and other Custard Piemen of letters. But
this gradual recognition was to be denied to
him. A terrible accident brought a devas-
tating acclamation. Some official of the
New York Society for the Suppression of
Vice burrowed wonderingly through “Jurgen”
and pronounced it indecent, indicating 83
pages in which his microscope had detected
offensive matter. The book was suppressed,
and Cabell bounded from the twilight into
the blazing noon of unsolicited notoriety.
More than that, a few writers of authority
like Hugh Walpole, Mencken and Burton
Rascoe, of Chicago, rose to hail Cabell as
a neglected genius, who, by his imaginative-
ness and sense of fantasy, was undoubtedly
the Dreamboy of the Western World.
“Jurgen” is founded on the folklore of
Poictesme, and in the author’s own words
is told for “the tale’s sake.” It is a heady
romance, a frolic of the senses, sometimes
dark with doubt and melancholy, but plead-
ing with a poet’s wistfulness against the
everydayness and dulness of Reality. It
takes the sympathetic reader down the
avenue of Time into regions of myth and

DAVID JONES’,
OPP. G.P.0., SYDNEY.
sorcery, its lucid language, sly jousts at
modernity, with its over-color of a sceptical
philosophy, reminding one again and again
of Anatole France. Often it has a baffling
touch of allegory, occasionally a flavor of
Rabelais, and one detects in the love epi-
sodes the amatory brio of Stendhal’s ‘‘Char-
treuse de Parme” ; but to the student with-
out prejudice who wants to forget for a while
the world of factory-whistles, movie-shows
and trams, there is entertainment in every
page. It would be impossible to relate the
whole story accurately unless it were learnt
by heart, Jurgen has such devious wander-
ings, such a wide and secure scholarship,
such quickness in the ripostes of a sardonic
conversation, that one marvels at the talent
of the man who made him so seductive, smart
and plausible. To take one instance, what
is more ingenious in fancy than the episode
with the ghost of King Smoit? His
Majesty, who is condemned to haunt the scenes
of numerous beastly murders on the anni-
versary of each affair, has two dates clashing
in different places, and seeing that it is im-
possible to t keep both engagements, induces
Jurgen to impersonate him by giving him a
potion. One starts to chuckle as Jurgen
slowiy loses his substantiality, and then, sud-
denly, misty and intangible and deprived
of the force of gravity, but Still resplendent
in his consciousness of an imperial adveh-
ture, floats through the ceiling to behold a
diverting picture in the room above. The
Anatole France who wrote the superb
“Revolt of the Angels” would hardly disdain
authoring such a situation.
Yet, with the fame that has come to
“Jurgen” since its emergence from the ban
of censorship, Cabell still hears many a
voice trying to drown the choir of admira-
tion. The late Maurice Hewlett, disturbed
in his prance through the 13th century by
this challenger in a domain which he had
considered peculiarly his, sheathed the rapier
he ordinarily employed in criticism, and
turned on the intruder all the accumulated
Frightfulness of a soured and disappointed
soul. “Who is this man Cabell?” 'he cried
in effect, and answered that he was an igno-
ramus, a mere pretender. Why, he uses the
word “geas,” whatever that may mean, and
(Heaven help us!) places Albania near the
Bay of Biscay. Cabell’s answering letter,
in which he proved that “geas” (meaning
obligation) is common in Gaelic legend, and
that the Albania mentioned was in Scot-
land, was an unexpected sortie by the then
beleaguered hero, and showed that he had
resources in controversy more delicate and
demoralising than Hewlett’s minnenwerfer
methods. It would be an exaggeration to
say, of course, that the Hewlett tradition
staggered under the piercing assault of the
Virginian. But still “Richard Yea-and-Nay”
and the rest lost some of their savor and
point to many thoughtful Americans after
the exposure of Hewlett’s doubtful learning.
Cabell, whose “Jurgen” has been given an
English edition by John Lane, lisis been re-
sponsible for several other books, some of
which are studies of life in Virginia—one of
them unknown to me has the queer title of
“The Rivet in Grandfather’s Neck” ; but his
reputation stands on his exploitation of
mediaeval legends. His “Figures of Earth,”
dealing with Manuel, the swineherd, is
almost a companion volume to “Jurgen” ; but
the humor is more insidious, and the quiet
laughter ripples away occasionally into a
tart titter. It would be impossible for such
a sensitive author to stifle himself for a
purely objective creation, and so one per-
ceives gleams of personal experiences and
hears echoes of polemics and attitudes (ex-
pounded more directly elsewhere) in sundry
discourses between Manuel and other char-
acters of the yarn. Probably the best guide
to Cabell and his works is his “Beyond Life,”
in which he expresses through a phantom
named Charteris genial theses on the metier
of Romance in making Man oblivious of his
incompetent self. The book is deft, ardent
and invigorating, but it is impossible to label
it as a novel, essay or good belles-lettres. The
incidental talk on various authors, including
Restoration dramatists and the gallantries of
the period, is exceedingly clever and wise.
Perhaps the writing sometimes dodges spec-
tacularly by a hair’s-breadth, and stylists
have solid ground to justify a complaint
against the use of such adverbs as “uglily”
and “likelily”; but still there is many a
phrase that sings, many a passage that is
charged with beauty.

“Halek” and its Author
John H. Nicholson, who, over 30 years ago,
wrote “Halek,” has just passed away at
Northgate (Q ). For some years his fine
inind had been periodically clouded ; and the
dark hours that Coleridge, Cowper and other-
gifted ones knew were his. The last few
months of his life were saddened, too, by the
thought that his romance had been forgotten;
and when I brought him the news that, at
the last meeting of the Queensland Authors
and Artists’ Society, someone had praised
“Halek” warmly, he said: “Don’t tell me of
these things ; I am out of it all now.”
“Halek” is written in pure, clear-cut Eng-
lish, with Scriptural directness and simplicity.
The reader never has to struggle with a doubt-
ful meaning—though subtle, the style is never
involved. And the music of Nicholson’s son-
orous prose is haunting. The story is in-
teresting and well conceived;* Those who knew
the author best will realise that it is largely
biographical. It concerns a musician and
his pilgrimage from Pagum—the lowest state,
where all pleasure is material—to Ivarom,
where the joys of the mind are uppermost.
Love comes to him in two guises. Turoni,
the ideal woman, hears his trial song in the
Hall of Musicians, and is brave enough to
criticise. Then his wounded vanity is
soothed by the flattery of a Kashepa-passion
in the guise of love, and many snares beset
his body, and clip his wings, as he sings the
soul less erotic songs that his Delilah ap-
plauds. But Turoni is ever his spirit-guide;
and when he bursts the bonds with which
Delilah has bound him he finds she has per-
fected herself in the lessons of Karom, and
has gone on to Adaroni, where he may not
follow till atonement is made and his music
has grown nobler.
A book of verse, published in 1916. K
Gordon and Gotch, contains amid much that
is worthless some rare gems of thought. An-
other novel. “Almoin published much later
than “Halek, though clothed in the same
beautiful language, is not so fine as liis first
work, which went far afield and, incidentally,
was responsible for the romance that brought
a glow and beauty to the last years of his
life. A lady in California, of Swedish de-
scent, so greatly admired “Halek” that she
commenced to translate it into Swedish. Cor-
respondence with the author followed, and
it led to their marriage in Brisbane.
Nicholson spent his early youth in the Lake
Country, in the North of England. Coming
to Queensland as a young man, he studied
our bird-life, and later put his knowledge to
commercial use. Then he took up teaching,
conducting private schools and also teach-
ing in the State schools. Like Brunton
Stephens, he found the deprivations of the
bush distasteful, though it was in compara-
tive isolation at Springsure that “Halek” was
born. So with Stephens, the bush isolation
was responsible for “Convict Once.”
The Authors and Artists’ Association, lately
formed in Brisbane, with Professor Stables
as president, purposes to form a library of
neglected Queensland books. “Elalek” may
thereby be helped to become more appreciated
in the land of its birth.
EMILLY BULOOCK.
Brains and Sex Again
Lester Way makes confession
It is not at all surprising that a man of some
intellect such as “L. Ross” should think that all
women are slangy mental paupers. Kor is it strange
that a woman of the intellectual pretensions cf
“C.8.M.” should think of men as a lot of posturing
fools. The fact is that men of intellect nearly always
choose the brainless sort of women for company, and
women of mental accomplishments choose men that are
fools.
A good deal of the talk about intellectual interest
is sheer hypocrisy. If a man is intelligent, it is because
intelligence is his pet conceit. He strives to excel at
mental feats just as the bull-minded pugilist strives
to excel at jaw-breaking. Both are feeding their con-
ceit. And, as the pugilist seeks for companions those
that he can bully, so the man of brains seeks as his
companions those that he can browbeat, and to whom
he can appear as a man of inexplicable profundity.
He is utterly afraid of a woman who can think or
talk intelligently, because, before her, his posturing
would be transparent. He doesn’t want to be under-
stood. He wishes above all to be misunderstood. He
craves for worshippers, and his unconscious tells' him
that an intelligent woman will not worship him.
That is the reason why one nearly always finds a
man of intelligence with a flapper.
The same is true of our intelligent women. Only more
so. Intellectual pursuits are more of a strain to women
than to men. Thoughtfulness, in any one, is merely
a pose, but to a woman it is a more conscious pose
than to a man. And so, the woman being more
acutely aware of the price she is paying for her
intellect, she is more anxious for it to yield her that
sense of superiority which she covets. She wishes
with an all-powerful wish to be accepted as a
superior being and to patronise others. She wants
to be accepted as an authority. And so, in choosing
her friends and consorts from the male sex, she
selects not the mentally superior but the mentally
inferior. Before these and before these alone she can
strut in all the glory of her proud intellectual attain-
ments.
When we realise that these are the secret springs
of our intellectual aspirings, it becomes plain that
there can be no attraction between a man of mental
pride and a woman of cultural pretensions. There
is a definite aversion, and where two such do allow
themselves to become mated we find each suffering
with a sense of under-valuation. But that seldom
happens. Just as the man who pursues study does so
without being conscious of why he does it, so he
avoids women who are engaged in the same pursuit
without being conscious that he is avoiding them. He
mixes intimately only with the gushing females who
are all sex and no brain, and who can, therefore,
satisfy both his love of the feminine and his craving
for a pedestal. That, of course, leaves the thought-
hunting females no choice but to associate with un-
thinking males, and they do. Though they express
disappointment at the mental attainments of their
companions, yet they are greatly comforted by that
disappointment and would not part with it for all
the world.
Personally, I don’t want an intelligent woman for
a companion. I want the fluffiest, most powdery,
most chattery, most brainless flapper I can find—
something that I can kiss just for the fun of kissing
while I congratulate myself on being so superior.
And that is just another way of saying that I am
one of those who pose as a male of mentality.
Clean Psycho-analysis
Professor Freud’s theory of dreams—that
they are caused by man’s “unconscious” re-
flecting suppressed infantile sexual desires —
has always been too extravagant for many
people to accept; and it is refreshing to
find a book by the late Dr. Rivers which,
while accepting what is valuable in
Freudism, yet considers that dreams may
be explained by “conflict” in the unconscious
mind. That is to say, if one part of your
mind desires to do a thing while another
part thinks you had better not, then the re-
sult may be a dream which exhibits all the
queer symbolism and vagaries of an impish
Freudian “unconscious.”
In this book (Conflict and Dreams: Kegan
Paul) Dr. Rivers has analysed some of his
own dreams, using, as befits a sensible man
of great experience in a Scottish mental
hospital, ordinary words and terms that
anybody can understand. The essence of
the book appears to be summed up in the
sentence: “Dream is as little determined
solely by motives of sex as motives of this
kind are solely responsible for the morbid
processes of psycho-neurosis and for the pro-
ducts of artistic and religious activity.” This
seems to be a sensible summary of the
whole position. Any motive can cause a
“conflict,” and can thus > cause a dream;
possibly it may cause an outpouring of
artistic impulse, and perhaps of the religious
instinct. We are not altogether confined
to unclean theories about sex,-which we are
now taught are not really so unclean as one
might think on first reading them, because
“sex” implies not merely the sexual act,
but the whole principles of human tenderness,
of increase and fruitfulness and of long
life. But. after all, they are still dreams,
and no doubt have a meaning, though not
as the lovers think and the servant-girls who
follow dream-books.
The idea of conflict has become rather im-
portant. The novelists recognised it long
before the psychologists; and many of our
greatest works of imagination depict a con-
flict between complexes. Thus Hamlet de
scribes a conflict between Hamlet’s “ego-
complex” and his “herd-complex.” Tess is
at war between her own “herd-complex”
and her “sex-eomplex.” You could extend
the list indefinitely. No person can be
happy if one part of his unconscious mind is
urging him to do something which another
part opposes; and this explains Freud’s
“pleasure-principle,” which simply means
release of mental tension. Everybody is
actuated by his desire to avoid a conflict
in his “unconscious.” That is the psycholo-
gical definition of Hedonism, land rather
seems to have gone back to the old idea that
pleasure is merely absence of that pain to
which man is born as the sparks fly upward.
But it is very far from the gross definition
that pleasure simply means wine and women,
and might probably lead to a nobler type of
humanity than either Stoicism or Epicurean-
ism, by both of which mankind is generally
actuated to a greater or less degree. It is
largely a word-juggling, a logomachy.
C. McL.
A Satchel of Books
The Tragedy of Central Europe, by E. Ashmead-
Bartlett (Thornton Butterworth). Brilliantly writ-
ten, as all Ashmead-Bartlett’s books are, but be-
lated. It ends with the exile to Madeira of the
Emperor Karl of Austria. His sympathies are
strongly monarchist, and in Bolshevik leaders such
as Bela Kuhn, Pagany, Argoston and Szamuelly—-
predacious Hebrews of small intellectual capacity—
he met the worst of an unpleasant tribe. Yet life
maintains a judicial impartiality throughout. The
book should be of value to future historians of the
period for its shrewd sketches of the men, great and
small, who surged to the front in the early days of
an agony which is still in progress.
The Minster, by Arthur E. J. Legge (John Lane).
This man is coming on: “The Minster” is one of the
best of the season’s novels, although its author is
over-addicted to homicide for the purpose, of getting
rid of characters who have become bothersome. He
puts real people on his stage, and his' phrasing is
excellent. The wife of the struggling sculptor, for
instance—the daughter of a man who kept an artists'
materials shop in Chelsea and had been brought up
in it. She and her husband have to call on a patron
whose mother-in-law will be there, the frigid Lady
St. Hugh. The artist is nervous, but his wife re-
assures him. She will deal with the angular ice-
berg. “If the old woman tries to put me down,”
she says, “I’ll make her feel as if she were sitting
for the nude.” The book is quite worth getting.
A Book of Burlesques, by H. L. Mencken (Jonathan
Cape). This is sardonic humor, inspired by a lively
contempt for the follies of the world. The mocking
imitation of the highbrow explanations in musical
programmes is most effectively done,. and the “asep-
tic” marriage, lampooning the ideas of the eugenists,
contains many a chuckle. Equally good is the
“stage direction” for a modern wedding wherein
Mencken makes many shrewd lunges at the prepos-
terous indignities thrust by the unthinking on a
sensitive bridegroom. “The Jazz Webster,” a short
dictionary for cynics, has even a more mordant
significance. Some examples: “Suicide: A belated
acquiescence in the opinions of one’s wife’s rela-
tives.” “Civilisation: A concerted effort to remedy
the blunders and check the practical joking of God.”
“Yacht Club: An asylum for landsmen who would
rather die of drink than be seasick.”
Roman Pictures, by Percy Lubbock (Jonathan
Cape). Lubbock, who is the author of that acute
study, “The Craft of Fiction,” here pours out his
finely balanced prose in descriptions of the foreign
life of Rome. Occasionally his eye strays to topo-
graphical features —he takes a glimpse from a balcony
or peeps into the interior of St. Peter’s —but his
attention is always springing back to sundry people
he meets. They all appear to have done something,
or to have something on their minds. They can’t
throw off the shadow of a singular furtiveness, of
holding themselves defensively against the author’s
inquisitive intent. Of course, it is all an illusion
created by his writing, which is limpid and artful,
but, despite its cosmopolitan attitude, is as insular
as G. K. Chesterton’s. The work breathes of England,
the Englishman’s punctiliousness in personal clean-
liness, and the educated Englishman’s love for his
language.
American Short Stories, edited by Alexander Jessup
(Allyn and Bacon). The editor makes a remarkable
assertion in his preface: “It is now generally acknow-
ledged, in Europe as well as in America, that in the
short story America, ever since Poe, has led the
world.” Poe and Hawthorne were geniuses, but
how many of their quality has American produced
since the middle of last century ? This book dis-
closes the barrenness of the land. Henry James is
represented by a tedious and unreal English yarn,
Mark Twain by “The Jumping Frog,” Bret Harte by
a couple of his mining-camp tales, and Bierce by his
famous “An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.” Of
the minor stars William Dean Howells, Chambers,
Booth Tarkington (“Monsieur Beaucaire”), Jack
London (with his admirable “The Seed of McCoy”)
and O. Henry are the most notable. The best that
can fairly be said for the American short story is
that it is superior, as a rule, to that of England,
though even in this medium such writers as Wells
and even Conan Doyle have done work which com-
pares favorably with anything produced by the
America of their generation. The perfect short story
comes, of course, from the country of Balzac, Gau-
tier, De Maupassant and the Goncourts. It is a
specialist art in which no English-speaking nation
approaches the French.
The Cream of the Jest, by James Branch Cabell
(John Lane). There are indications that the modern
American of imagination spends a lot of time raging
against his standardised environment, and deploring
his wife’s intellectual materialism. Cabell does it
in his new book. Felix Ivennaston is a literate and
articulate Babbitt. Like Babbitt, liennaston has a
dream woman, unexpected, pulsating, to whom he
turns from the arid dulness of his wife’s society.
Like Babbitt, he frees himself of his foolishness at
the end of the book: “For all of us the dream-haze
merges into the glare of common day; the dea certe,
whom that roseate light transfigured, stands confessed
a simple, loving woman, a creature of like flesh and
limitations as our own; but who are we to mate
with goddesses?” Unlike Sinclair Lewis, Cabell has
a glowing style and an intimate acquaintance with
the queer byways of history. This enables him to
present liennaston and Ettarre with telling effect
at Tunbridge Wells in the 18th century ; in Jerusa-
lem during the Crucifixion; in Valladolid at the
deathbed of Columbus; in Troy, where they saw
Priam, then a child, playing marbles. Edgar Saltus
exploited the romance of history on something similar
lines and in the same musical prose, arabesqued
with archaisms and odd words, in “Imperial Purple.”
But the misunderstood American husband and the
unappreciative American public had not been dis-
covered in his day, so he simply went ahead and gave
a collection of fascinating word-pictures of the
periods that interested him without troubling to
hang a story to them. The story is the only super-
fluous feature of “The Cream of the Jest.”
The Spell of the Inland, by John Armour, pub-
lished a few months back, is threatening to run to
a second edition. It is a curiously uneven book, but
interesting for the picture of life in Central Australia
it glimpses. The author, now Presbyterian minister
at Lancefield (Vic.), was on Inland Mission work
for about two years. His headquarters were at Bel-
tana (S.A.), and over a beat 500 miles by 400,
stretching from the south of Lake Eyre to within 40
miles of Broken Hill, he was doctor, dentist, parson
and teacher as occasion demanded. “The Spell of
the Inland” appeared serially in the Presbyterian
Messengeßj and for the most part it plays to that
gallery—a rather too-closely chronicled record
of the doings of a missioner; though towards
the end the yarn gets into a swinging stride of inter-
est. The reverend hero of the story, who punches
publicans, faces axe-armed men in the d.t.’s, beards
villains in their dens and solves murder mysteries, is
drawn with such painful lack of humor that his com-
placent perfection becomes almost irritating. The
author is utterly unconscious of the value of light
and shade in these things, and the reader longs for
someone to up-end the padre—just once to turn him
from a puppet into a believable human being. But
it’s a first book; Armour is still young, and craft
will come with experience. His two years in Cen-
tralia have loaded him with material that must be
turned to good account later on.

I HAVE just completed the installation of the
finest Linseed-oil Plant in Australia, and very
soon, with the support of the Trade, I hope to
duplicate this Mill. All is ready for duplication.
The Mill just completed is the finished product
of the world’s experience in the manufacture of
Linseed Oil, the full knowledge of which I have
obtained by careful and consistent study over the
past 1 2 years.
During the early months of 1922 I visited the
works of the principal manufacturers in England,
and in consultation with Messrs. Geo. Scott & Son
(London), Ltd., the foremost British manufacturers
of Linseed-oil Machinery, a Mill was planned and
the machinery built with their co-operation and
advice, so to-day the Works at Looking-glass Bay,
Gladesville, embrace the very latest ideas for the
production of Linseed Oil by the Solvent Process.
I can guarantee that oil manufactured by this
Plant will be entirely free from all albumen or
sediment of any description, and will NOT break
at a temperature of 600 deg. F.
I have worked throughout with one firmly-fixed
idea: The production of the highest-quality oil at
the lowest possible cost. Directly after my first sale
the price of Linseed Oil in Australia dropped 3d.
per gallon.
ENGLISH PARITY.
The whole of my energies have been directed
to the day, not far distant, when I shall be selling
oil at English parity. Ten years ago, when I was
in control of my father’s Mill, it was said that was
impossible. By the institution of new plant and
modern methods, together with careful watching
of the foreign markets in seed purchases and
disposal of by-products, I was able in 1914 to go
even one better than outside prices, never quoting
above any opposition. I am confident that after
six months of successful working of the Mill just
completed, with its remarkable efficiency, I shall
again be able to quote the trade months ahead.
My many friends of the Trade will realise that
to enable me to bring about this most satisfactory
position it has been necessary for me to have had
the co-operation of others.

MESSRS. George Scott 6c Son (London), Ltd., have, through
their Australian representatives, Messrs. Gibson, Battle 6c Co.,
Ltd., supplied a most efficient Plant, the entire installation,
comprising the Solvent Extraction Plant, Boilers, Mechanical Handling
Machinery, Motors, etc., having been made by the latter Company, who
have the benefit and experience of one of Messrs. Scott 6c Son’s leading
Engineers on their Staff. The successful operation of any plant must
depend upon the man in charge, and in this I am most fortunate, having
secured the services of my old friend Mr. Rollo Huntley (who is well
known to the trade), and who is occupying the position of Mill Manager.
To Mr. J. A. Oag, Jun., Contractor and Builder, King Street,
Balmain, I am indebted for the erection of the magnificent building in
which the plant is housed.
Always the name of Meggitt has been associated with Linseed Oil
within England and Australia. My father produced the first gallon of
oil in Australia 1 5 years ago. When he retired, after a successful but
fierce battle against prejudice and vested interests, I succeeded as
Managing Director. The production grew from 100,000 gallons a year
in 191 3 to 900,000 gallons per year in 1916. Up to the time I visited
England I was Agent for Messrs. James Barnes, Ltd.
The upshot of it all is that to-day Australian Linseed Oil is equal
in quality to any produced, and is recognised by the trade as such.
The present annual consumption of Australian-produced oil in the
Commonwealth, New Zealand and the Islands is over 2,000,000 gallons.
In so few years this will be recognised as a very big hchievement,
placing the Linseed Oil business among the first of the big undertakings
in Australia. This achievement, however, was not consummated only by
those immediately concerned.
The big Wholesalers, Painters and Government Officials are to be
recognised for their efforts and assistance, and many times they sacrificed
profits to help foster this important Australian Industry. Names that
come readily to my mind are

the whole of Australia, to whom I give my word that I am working
entirely apart from all other Linseed Oil undertakings.

He took dead words and fashioned them
With tender touch and true;
He painted them with green and gold

That mountains keep or valleys hide,
And set them glittering side by side
In vivid life anew.

To find the lifeless words of old

The River’s Way.
As the river seaward rushes,
There to lose itself forever,
Hays the sheeak-tree a-quiver,
“Pause awhile, O shining river!”
But the river pauses never.
Many birds, melodious, gather,
Where the dewy saplings glisten
On its banks, their songs outgushing;
But the river onward rushing
Never stays its course to listen.
Sweet the rest of brown-tressed she-oaks
In the dewy breeze a-quiver!
Sweet bird-music, free of worry!
But it may be in its hurry
Equal sweetness finds the river.

The Visitation.
The little one’s life is ebbing;
The candle is burning low ;
As the faint flame flickers the shadows
Uncertainly come and go.
The mother sits by the cotside
In a sorrow beyond all tears,
Her soul bent beneath the burden
Of vista’d, lonely years.
Faintly the little one whispers:
“Who is it, mother dear,
Who has come to us in the night-time?
Who is it lurking here?”
The mother soothes the sick one.
“Nay, all alone are we;
In the room there is no other
But you, my love, and me.”
“But he is there. I know it;
I feel him hovering by.
Yet I cannot hear him or see him—.
Why, mother? Tell me why.”
The candle has burnt to the finish ;
The grey dawn fills the room ;
The shadows have fled, yet the mother
Knows but a deeper gloom.
As she draws the reluctant eyelids
Over eyes no longer bright,.
She knows who came in the night-time—
Knows that the child was right.

Of spirit that beyond these prisoning bars.
Hard with the days and narrowed by the
sense,
Touches emotion as of gods, made young,
Poised on the verge of nothing, limbs grown
tense
For some vast leap after the dreams un-

THE IDEAL EMPIRE.
It is a serious matter to construct out of
mixed materials an ideal and permanent
empire, and the conference which is to meet
shortly in London, with Prime Minister
Bruce assisting, will doubtless approach it
in a serious spirit. The question is how to
keep together for defence purposes a con-
federacy which is too scattered, and contains
too many races and languages and colors,
and has been acquired by too many curious
devices, to hold together very well save as
a matter of expediency.- More urgently, it is
a question of keeping together the white races
which have shown themselves capable of self-
government, and which can intermarry with-
out racial destruction. Every imperial con-
ference is called for this purpose, though
“the Prevention of the Dissolution of the
Empire” doesn’t appear in bald and naked
frankness on the agenda paper. Yet, while
the object is to keep the Going Concern
together, it is important not to keep it too
much together; wherefore the apparently
settled idea is that the great self-governing
sections should be free to leave, and vet
should not leave.
* *. # *
An objection made by the unanimous voice
of disaffection is that under the present sys-
tem, which is no system at all, Australia is
liable, at any hour of the night or
day. to be dragged into a war not of its
making or seeking, and ivhich it had no voice
in bringing about. So are all the Dominions”
and there can be no free and ideal State
under such unreasonable conditions. Cer-
tainly the Dominions need not send a man
or a ship to the scene of action, but that
won’t prevent the scene of action coming to
them, which is a great deal worse than going
\Lh’ aS ™ Dyone wbo counts the ruins in
Northern France may see. The only way
to keep out of any particular war is for a
dominion to get out of the Empire, to per-
nnddfr>all han f s *° recognise that it is out,
persuade them to live up to the recog-
fhnr « After that it has only to make sure
that no one takes a mean advantage of it
no rlri? ' f^ W h is , S°ing to do that
no man has yet discovered. The great tra-
&l m °K de i n times began with Serbia and
b °*i h • P eaceful an d independent,
being dragged into a war which thev had
7r° ICe “ ak ing than Australia
had, and Korea had the same experience in
» Ult^, r l CeDt tlmes % And they all ha d war in
a much worse form than Australia did,
though not worse than Australia might easily
- lf V" l°i 3ld of the lability to be sum-
maiily included in British squabbles. So no
really sane person suggests that Australia
should set up for itself, with less than the
population ot Belgium, with five-sixths of its
vast area devoid of even a pretence of de-
„ ca » an d with a smouldering quarrel with
a u w . or^s c olored races on its hands;
and that it should keep all its manhood under
military training, and spend 60 per cent, of
its revenues on its army and navy, and even
then live with precipice for its threshold and
care for its thorny bed. But though no one
who is really sane wants to go out, there is
a persistent demand that if we stav in it
should be on certain terms, in order to make
the staying in seem logical.
* * * *
The list of propositions to that end isn’t
long, for the alternatives are really few:
That Agents-General and High Commissioners and
such-like representatives should be organised as an
Advisory Committee’’ upon affairs which concern
the Empire outside the United Kingdom. (Turned
down with enthusiasm, because at a great and
hurried crisis—and crises are apt .to be matters of
red-hot haste—no one would have time for their
advice unless they could promise or refuse men and
money, and no one dreams of putting any such
power, or real power of any sort, in the hands of
superannuated politicians, who don’t even represent
a decayed mining constituency. If a slow crisis
arose it could be dealt with as at present.)
That prominent Australians and other Dominioners,
whether passing through or fixed in England, should
be permitted to voice Dominion sentiment in the
House of Lords, there being no place for them in the
Conjmfons, except in the Strangers’ Gallery. (Not
even considered, the Lords being a futile folk, and
this country having no faith in absentees, or in dis-
tinguished globe-trotters who represent nothing save
their luggage.)
That a member of the Federal Cabinet should be
stationed in London. As a live politician with a
recent mandate from the people he would rank
above an Agent-General or High Commissioner, also
above an Ambassador. (But even if the entire
Cabinet, barring the Postmaster-General, took up its
residence in London, there would be an objection to
its being empowered to do things without the assent
of Parliament. And if Parliament could deliberate
on its | acts at unlimited length and then undo them,
it seems that an Australian Cabinet, or a bit of a
Cabinet, in London would be no faster or more
definite than the sort of persons Australia has there
now. Still, the Resident Minister idea, which has
Bruce’s support, is better than the others, and little
good at that.)
Finally, there is the scheme of a Super-Parliament
to attend to purely Imperial concerns. It would be
a body in which the United Kingdom and all the
Dominions and, possibly, in a minor way, the odd-
ments of Empire, would be represented, though the
Dominions, unless they found much more popula-
tion, would only be there to be outvoted. This
august institution would deal with matters of war
and peace, and fix the armaments and contributions
of every Dominion, and each Dominion would get a
voice in Empire affairs by the simple and logical pro-
cess of letting the Empire have a voice in its affairs.
In short, the idea is Imperial Federation, and
though makeshifts, stopgaps and expedients may be
devised, Imperial Federation is the only method
of giving the Dominions a definite part in the control
of their own world-concerns which anyone has de-
vised. The chief drawback about Imperial Federa-
tion is that, since it imperils the management of
our own affairs by ourselves, it has hardly a friend
save here and there a peer with one foot in the
grave, and an occasional Bruce Smith.
* * * *
Probably, when the question of closer and
more permanent relations between Britain
and the Dominions has been considered all
over again, the decision will be to let the
present lack-of-system scramble along un-
til further notice. It might be improved on
if younger men—men of affairs with some
future before them —were appointed to the
semi-ambassadorial job, instead of decayed
politicians who regard it as the last thing
before extinction : but that would be merely
a change of detail. The ideal empire seems
a dream, and the permanent one also, like-
wise the perfect marriage of States or human
beings or of anything else. Even a perfect
funeral is rare. Secret diplomacy is neces-
sary, though it may be the antithesis of
democratic principles, for a distressed State
which advertised for allies in the daily papers
would probably be dead before it had time
to open the answers. That cuts out Parlia-
mentary debate. Haste is at times an essen-
tial of salvation, and if it was necessary to
call a terrace of Dominion Parliaments to-
gether to decide on war or peace, the 48-
hours’ ultimatum would have expired before
they had fairly begun to debate the Address-
in-Reply. Still, change of a harmless sort
is refreshing. If Prime Minister Bruce de-
cides that a Minister shall be stationed in
London, it will be a pleasure to watch the
experiment, provided the Treasurer isn’t sent
there, and the Budget left to the inexpert
care of the man in the Repatriation Depart-
ment.
THE INEFFECTIVE TARIFF.
Evidence accumulates that the “revised”
tariff, now nearly three years old, has failed
to achieve its author’s purpose. The expan-
sion of industry confidently predicted by
Massy Greene has not occurred, nor is it
likely to occur while conditions remain as
they are. For this Greene’s tariff is not
wholly to blame, but the fact of its ineffec-
tiveness has got to be faced and dealt with.
The evidence can be found in Wickens’s
statistics, in the report of the Tariff Board,
read between the lines, and in the gathering
protests of idle Australian workmen. There
is abundance of it in the table of imports
and exports for 1922-23. That saddening
statement shows that, although Australia had
to pay its mostly foreign creditors interest
on a gross debt which stood at £879,303,000
(£154 p.h.) on June 30, imports were valued
at £131,808,000 and exports at £117,913,000.
The apparent balance on the wrong side was
£13,895,000; the real balance was something
like £50,000,000. In N. S. Wales, which
continues to borrow magnificently, the excess
of imports amounted to £12,409,000; in Vic-
toria, which could afford to dispense with
the luxury of a loan jag, it was £13,2(53,0007
in Tasmania it was £870,000. The other
three States had favorable balances, Queens-
land’s being £4,992,000, Westralia’s
£3,170,000 and South Australia’s £2,740,000.
As usual, the exports were mostly raw sub-
stances : the imports nearly all manufactured
goods. In process of time the raw sub-
stances will be worked up in foreign fac-
tories, and portion will come back in expen-
sive steamers to compete with the produce of
our own factories. That the operation may
be financed the Commonwealth and State
Governments (the latter alone oorrowed
£198,000,900 in eight years) will go into
debt some more. For that is the Australian
way.
*** * .
More than half of last year’s export
values was supplied by Australia’s old friend
the sheep. Significantly, the sheep industry
was exempt from the mania of Governments
for running all sorts and sizes of enterprises
into the insolvency stage—stores, steamers,
trawlers, fish-shops, cattle-runs, freezing-
works, canned-fruit and birdseed pools. The
sheep has been lucky enough to escape the
benevolence of Labor and Nationalist poli-
ticians and strong enough to survive their
enmity. Which enmity was expressed in
such ways as clapping specially high railway
freights on wool, raising rents of Crown
leases by retroactive measures, resuming
sheep land in order to grow loan vegetables
on it, and fomenting lawless strikes to hold
up the shearing. It is not at all pleasant to
consider how Australia would get along with-
out the jumbuek, which the professional poli-
ticians loathe because there are no votes in
him. The pity of it is that so little is added
to the value of the output by local manufac-
turing processes. This is one respect in
which the tariff has been lamentably inad-
the wool sent away last year
~45>o19,00() worth was greasy and only
±J, .112,000 worth scoured. Moreover, im-
ports of woollen piece goods, which dimin-
lshed in 1921-22 when, the tariff was new
and hc >pe s were: high, jumped during the year
from £3,142,000 to £5,116,000. Yet Parlia-
ment persuaded itself that, fertilised by 45
P-c. ? n d P- c - duties, mills would spring
up like mushrooms. Purchases of foreign
??>o! S o t ? nd stockings bulked £1,599,000 in
1921-22; £2,708,000 in 1922-23. The total
increase in the apparel and attire section,
which includes blankets, hats and caps,
boots and shoes, was £10,765,000— i.e., from
£34,149,000 to £44,914,000. Yet nearly all
the corresponding articles are made in Aus-
tiali.a, a . the tariff were effective the
roreign inflow would be steadily retreating
instead of advancing 31 p.c. in 12 months.
Imports of rubber and leather goods, also
2i a 2i',wwt\ u ' ed & „ Australia, went from
£1,659,000 to £2,641,000. Motor chassis,
nearly all American, accounted for £6,117 000
as against £2,927,000 the previous year.
Australia is the only country with preten-
sions to being civilised that isn’t making
motor-driven vehicles. It is an industry
that will have to be tackled in real earnest
without one the country might be lost in
case _of invasion. In the metals and
machinery group, of which Parliament cher-
ished the brightest expectations, imports
reached £35,195,000, compared with
£25,096,000 in 1921-22. Part of the “credit”
for the £10,099,000 increase is claimed by
Board. On the recommendation
or that body free admission was granted in
314 instances to machines, machine-tools
and appliances. In anofther case the rails
and track materials needed for a line to the
group settlements in South-west W.A. were
allowed in free of duty, the Board being
"influenced by the fact that the Broken Hill
1 ropnetary, Ltd., was not then manufactur-
ing. That was in October; and the chances
are that railway material will be piling up
at Newcastle (N.S.W.) long before the
group settlements become productive. In
any case, the Board was called into exist-
ence to foster Australian industry, not to
further the importing schemes of loan-drunk
politicians.
* * * *
xt P< 7 n * : . th® Board is that the
Navigation Act is injuring the manufacturer
who ships goods to other States. Since the
coasting trade was reserved for Australian
shipping, heavy freights are imposed on
our own products” travelling between State
and State, while oversea goods are carried
tor much lower freights.” In the result,
much of the benefit conceded by the tariff
is lost. ’ The fact is sufficiently notorious,
and those who framed the tariff and started
the Navigation Act on its thrilling career
utterly forgot to take it into account. It is
a , powerful argument, not for the repeal of
the Navigation Act (some sections of that
measure may have to be suspended or
amended, but, on principle, the Australian
shipowner and seaman are entitled to pro-
tection equally with other sections of the
community), but for an all-round increase
of duties. _ The flood of imports shows that
the tariff is hopelessly ineffective, and it wflll
have to be made effective, so that home
markets may be established for the fruit,
meat and other articles that Australia can
no longer sell abroad, or rely upon selling at
a profit. But the tariff can’t be made effec-
tive until there is a cessation of the wild
borrowing by which the importing boom
is fed. Another industrial necessity is a
reduction of the income-tax, to lighten the
burden on those already engaged in manu-
facturing and to encourage others to start.
Also, the workers will need to struggle out
of the go-glow and irritation-strike and
class-war frame of mind, and cease to regard
the production of Avealth as infinitely less
important than its distribution when the
Revolution arrives. The right sort of tariff
can do much for Australian industry, but it
can’t do everything.
“THE PUBLIC KNOWS WHAT IT
WANTS.”
captain Falcke, who is reported to be one
of those who assembled the Pterpont
Morgan art-collection, told Melbourne the
other day that the huge sums available under
the Felton Bequest are being squandered on
trash. He disarmed hostility by an appeal
to reason— Somebody will tell you some
day, so why should I not tell you now '/’*
recent uproar in Sydney over
ISorman Lindsays pictures a contributor
to the S. M. Herald disarmed hostility off
other lines. He condemned Lindsay’s v/Oilf
as trash, but confessed that he had no teciul--
cai knowledge of art whatever. He intro-
duced himself as an Ordinary Member of
the I üblic, and the public as the final arbiter
m matters of taste. "The public may invari-
ably be trusted to know a good thing when
it sees it. . The public knows what it
wants. It is a fatal superstition which is
making Australia the despair of discriminat-
ing people, home-born as well as foreign.
When Captain Falcke reaches Sydney
will presumably visit the National Gallery.
And there he will discover Connakd’s “Pic-
nic.’ It sparkles like a diamond in a dump of
beer-bottles. Herein the miracle of Life
is created out of paint: we get a work like
a Chopin interlude—a thing “covered with
day. ’ . But what is a Chopin interlude to
the multitude V “It’s no good to Gundy,“
Near the Connaed picture is one of a lugu-
brious dog lamenting its master on a canvas
of ‘gallery size.” The back files of the
Illustrated London News show stacks of
such stuff, which was ever popular for the
purpose of Christmas Supplements. This
work is said to be the most generally admired
in the Gallery : “The Picnic” is certainly
one of the most neglected. Connoisseurs of
tobacco are agreed that the Egyptian cigar-
ette is incomparably the best. And, as
Lord Nokthcliefe remarks in his recently
published diary, it is only in Egypt that
the Egyptian cigarette can be enjoyed to
perfection. Like the wines of Bordeaux
it is too delicate to travel. The Diggers
could have had the best of these cigarettes
in Cairo for 3s. a hundred: they preferred
to pay exorbitant prices for others. “The
public knows What it wants!” A short
time ago Sydney was offered the Irish
Players. It would be difficult to find their
artistic co-efficient in Paris. The public
preferred a Yankee “crook play” and an
exceptionally imbecile London musical
comedy. The tendency is not new, of
course. _ “A man came in balancing a straw
upon his nose,” remarks Oliver Goldsmith
(“At the Play”). “The audience fell into
raptures of applause. There is a great deal
of meaning in the straw. There is some-
thing suited to every apprehension in the
sight; and a fellow possessed of talents like
these is sure of making his fortune”*
Wren’s inscription in St. Paul’s directs
those who are in search of his monument
to look around them. When America’s peri-
patetic authority on art arrives in Sydney
he might go to some central spot, such as
Martin-place, and look around him. Nature
has bestowed the blessings and beauties of
light and air upon the city; but the public,
which in architecture as in other things
knows what it wants, is chiefly concerned
to shut them out. For the most part, the’
window, which may be one of the marvels
of the house-builder’s art, is represented
in modern Sydney by a hole in a wall, and
a trivial hole at that. From Martin-place
Captain Falcke might profitably pass on
to Macquarie-street and enter the Assembly.
He will find there a composite picture of
the public’s ideal legislator—a fluent illite-
rate, part altruist, part mountebank and
part knave. And if, on his return to the
U.S.A., he visits Congress, he will no doubt
find a similar type adorning that chamber.
* * * *
What it all means is that the public does
not know what it wants; and because it
does not, it is being swindled in a thousand
directions. It is seriously injured, though
it may not realise the fact now, by the
persistent way in w'hich those in authority
encourage the worst to be offered to it and
the best withheld. Bad paintings, poor ;
plays, trashy books, rape and murder news-
papers, vulgar cinema shows, Zane Grey,
Ethel Dell, “sex movies” from Los Angeles,
crime melodramas from New York all help
to poison culture; and a nation which has
been thoroughly poisoned in the cultural
sense is in an unfortunate position these
competitive days. The fount and origin
of the trouble is Parliament. If a Gilbert
Murray wished to represent a constituency
in Australia he would have no hope of
success against a retired hodcarrier with
a pull at Macdonell House, or an ex-grocer
with a pull at the National Club. A sec-
tarian member made an odd complaint the
other day:—
Why don’t you support an L.O.L. weekly paper? It
seems to me that the only time most of you trouble
to be Protestants is at elections, when you vote the
ticket for lack of better.
Though the speaker apparently did not
intend it that way, the real signification of
his remarks was that the vote is one of the
few assets many people value at less, than
a penny a week. It should be the aim of
the State to make it what it once was—a
thing of priceless worth. A device that
might be considered is the disfranchisement
of any citizen who proved incapable of pass-
ing an examination in the elements of State-
craft and political economy—everyday sub-
jects which cannot be sweated up, and
which the poor are in a position to master
equally with the rich. Once a class of
interested and intelligent voters was created
the quality of our legislators would auto-
matically improve, and with this change
the rest ought to follow. The democratic
creed is a good one, as a matter of general
principle; but, like other creeds, it has to be
protected when it is being used to achieve
improper ends.
INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT AND
THE U.S.A.
For over 80 years the nations other than
the U.S.A. have been concerning themselves
with international copyright. In 1886, at
Berne, a conference framed a convention
which provided that authors who were citi-
zens of any country of the Union should
unjoy in all other countries of the Union
the protection which their own laws
provided them. In the same year Britain
passed the International Copyright Act,
giving effect to the convention throughout
the Empire. Twelve years later, at Berlin,
a. more effective arrangement the Revised
Berne—was adopted, and in March, IJI4, a


protocol was annexed authorising any Copy-
right Union country to discriminate with re-
spect to the copyright protection it may
grant to works whose authors are subjects
or citizens of any country outside the Union
which does not give, or undertake to give,
adequate reciprocal protection to works first
published in any Copyright Union country.
To Great Britain and the Empire this pro-
tocol is of special importance. For in-
stance, since 1886 a U.S. author, when
acquiring U.S. copyright, may also acquire
British Empire copyright by the simultane-
ous publishing (“publishing” here does not
necessarily mean printing; the mere offer
to the public of copies will suffice) of his
work in Newfoundland, Britain, Australia
or any part of the Empire. The U.S.A. is
not a member of the Copyright Union. So if
it continues to refuse, as hitherto, adequate
reciprocal U.S. copyright to British authors,
then U.S. authors may be restricted in their
present enjoyment of British Empire copy-
right.
In the Copyright Act (1911) Britain
amended, brought up to date and consoli-
dated its law upon the whole subject. This
Act was adopted, with authorised modifica-
tions and additions, for Australia by the
Commonwealth Copyright Act (1912). Can-
ada, whose copyright problems have always
been peculiarly complicated by proximity to
U.S.A., stood out.
For many years copyright in U.S.A. was
unobtainable by aliens. The Chace Act
(1891) first made copyright available for
the works of citizens or subjects of such
foreign countries as the President might
proclaim to be sufficiently reciprocal in their
treatment of U.S.A. But the securing of
U.S.A. copyright for a book in the English
language is in all cases, whether it be local
or foreign, dependent upon fulfilment of
many formalities and conditions. Outstand-
ing amongst these is the so-called “manufac-
turing clause,” requiring the book to be wholly
printed, bound and in all respects manufac-
tured within the U.S.A. Following upon the
Revised Berne convention the Tounshend
Act brought U.S. legislation up to date in
1909. This Act liberalised for an outside
alien the requirement as to first publishing
or simultaneously publishing in U.S.A.
Within 30 days of first publication abroad
he might deposit a copy and secure interim
protection for 30 days from the date of such
deposit. This gave him a period ranging
from 30 to 60 days within which to comply
with the “manufacturing clause” and the
many other requirements necessary to per-
fecting copyright in U.S.A. Consequent
upon the war, this interim protection was
further extended. An Act of Congress of
1919, after providing concessions for works
of foreigners published abroad during the
war period, further provided as to books
published abroad in English, on or after the
President’s proclamation of peace, 60 days
for deposit and interim protection for four
months from date of deposit. Thus a period
of from four to six months is allowed in the
case of a book in English for local intro-
duction to and reprint in U.S.A.. and for
the fulfilment of the other essential condi-
tions.
Few British authors can regard these con-
cessions as of practical value. Unless an
alien has an established reputation, and an
assured market in U.S.A., he will not risk
the expense of reprinting an American
edition. And so, after 60 days from publica-
tion in his own country, his work is open
to any pirate in U.S.A. Meantime the U.S.A.
author or publisher, on mere nominal con-
ditions, may and usually does secure com-
plete copyright throughout the British
Empire. Unless assured that U.S.A. will
speedily reciprocate the principles • her
authors enjoy in British countries, Britain
and the Dominions would do well to exercise
the discrimination authorised by the 1914
protocol. The temptation in the case of Aus-
tralia, where American authors and pub-
lishers are of late finding an ever-growing
market, is almost irresistible. To accord
U.S.A. authors and publishers here precisely
the same rights and privileges as are granted
to ours there would inaugurate a boom in
the Australian printing, bookbinding and
allied trades. Branches or agencies of
American printing and publishing houses
would be established here to set up, print
and bind Australian editions of Ameri-
can works, for which copyright here
should be desired. Failing that, such works
could be reprinted and sold on their own
terms by Australian printers and publishers.
But this extreme step may not be necessary.
The U.S.A. can no -longer rely upon a world
war or continued British complacence to
stave off indefinitely the use of the retalia-
tory weapon. In April, 1922, Congressman
Tinchner introduced in the House of Repre-
sentatives a bill of a conciliatory nature
which was not proceeded with. In Decem-
ber last a similar bill was filed in the
Senate by-Senator Lodge and in the House
by Congressman Davis. This bill has since
been withdrawn. In January last Mr.
Tinchner replaced his former by a revised
bill, which now awaits attention. Each pro-
posed repeal of the “manufacturing clause”
—the Lodge-Davis measure wholly, the
Tinchner measure partially. The position is
complicated by Section 31 of the Tounshend
Act of 1909, which, during the existence of
U.S. copyright in a book, prohibits importa-
tion (even though authorised by the author
or owner of the copyright) of copies not set
up, printed and bound in accordance with
the “manufacturing clause,” The Lodge-
Davis bill proposed modification and adapta-
tion of Section 31, and would render it
obscure. The Tinchner bill leaves it un-
touched, relying on its implied future limita-
tion to works of U.S. origin only.
Mr. G. Herbert Turing, secretary of the
British Society of Authors, and editor of the
Author, has urged that the Tinchner bill,
if passed, would give foreign authors a U.S.
copyright in name only—a copyright ineffec-
tive* bv reason of its owner’s inability to
supply* his U.S. market, except by books
printed under the “manufacturing clause.”
The editor of the (British) Publishers’ Cir-
cular and Booksellers’ Record opposes mr.
Turing’s construction of the Tinchner
measure. On the other hand, Librarian
Raney, of the Johns Hopkins University,
and of the American Literary Association,
controverts Mr. Turing s contention. Le
Droit d’Auteltr, of Berne, the official organ
of the World Copyright Union, is seeminaly
satisfied that the Tinchner measure wiil
adequately dispose of the “manufacturing
clause,” but not of some other minor
obstacles to U.S. entry into the Union. But,
in any event, legal certainty can easily be
provided for once intention to do the right
thing becomes established in the U.S.A. _
Four years ago, when then Prime Minister
Hughes was in daily contact with President
Wilson and British Ministers, C. J. Dennis
cabled urging him to seize the opportunity
to advance true reciprocity in copyright be-
tween this country and U.S.A. Nothing,
however, eventuated. And whether President
Wilson could or would have advanced such
an objective, it must now be conceded, was
at least problematical. His League of
Nations covenant—his magnum opus —failed
to find favor with his fellow citizens on his
return from Europe. U.S.A. however, is not
without sense of international values in some
things. It recognises the advantages of the
League’s International Court, of Justice, in
which it proposes to participate, without,
however, as the late President Harding
emphasised, involving entry into the League
itself. Prime Minister Bruce, during his
forthcoming tour abroad, might endeavor to
make the opportunity which his predecessor
missed. Should he succeed he \yill earn en-
during gratitude from the ever-increasing
body of Australian producers of intellectual
property.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The More General Diffusion of Misery.
Consideration is already being given to the
annual possibility that the British winter
will be early and cold; and that is about the
same as saying that attention is being given
to the question of the unemployed, of whom
1,185,000 can be identified. They doubtless
include many working females, but assuming
them to be all males they represent about 10
per cent, of the men of working age. The
population of England and Wales being 649
per sq. mile in 1921, which is almost exactly
double what it was in 1861, and that of
England alone being over 700, the Govern-
ment is entering into contracts for the export
of population. There are, however, people
even in COBDEN-ridden Britain who hold that
a pleasant glow might be made at home this
coming winter by setting fire to the , Free-
trade tradition, and the idea would doubtless
spread faster if there was a wider diffusion
of misery—-not more misery, but misery more
equitably distributed, there being plenty of
misery to go round. No one talks of any
systematic Protection for agricultural pro-
duce—an idea which worked well when the
Cold Jmnd was still capable of feeding its
modest population in Waterloo days, but
which would be difficult now that the census
has grown 300 per cent. The best visible
hope for the farmer seems to lie in eliminat-
ing his landlord, and that would be a com-
plicated process. But there is nothing so
very complicated about Protection for manu-
factured goods, of which Britain imported
£230,000,000 worth in 1922. Britain finds in
the United States the same unsatisfactory
customer that Australia does, this being the
position:—
British Produce
Bought from Foreign Sold to Foreign Adverse
Stntrs. States. Balance.
£685,887,000 £434,716,000 £251,171,000
Bought from Foreign Sold to Foreign
States other than States other than
U.S.A. U.S.A.
£463,874,000 £382,694,000 £81,180,000
Bought from U.S.A. Sold to U.S.A.
£222,013,000 £52,022,000 £169,991,000
So the position in John Bull’s Country is
the same as it is here; if the United States
could be dropped off the map, and that great
money-getter and hoarder forgotten, the finan-
cial saving would be considerable. In fact,
the need for giving Uncle Sam reciprocity
whether he wants it or not, and putting a
tariff very like his own on his manufactured
goods, appears worth considering. As an-
other element m the case, German competi-
tion begins to be talked of almost in the pre-
war style. But Britain, despite all exten-
sions of the franchise, is governed in the
main by the old “ruling classes,” and as they
are still beyond the reach of absolute want
the need to reconsider their old fiscal super-
stition hasn’t yet been forced on them. In
the British financial year 1922-23 18 mil-
lionaires, one of them on the six-million mark,
died in the United Kingdom ;16 died worth
between the half-million and the million; and
over 200 besides who didn’t fall below
£IOO,OOO apiece. As it wasn’t an unhealthy
year many more of the same sort naturally
stayed alive. These people were probably of
opinion that the old way has served them
well enough. The big landowners (one of
them is still described in “Who’s Who” as
“owns about 1,000,000 acres”) take little
interest in Protection unless the old corn
duties can be revived. The shipping inter-
ests are willing and anxious to carry foreign
goods till the Day of Judgment and after
just as their forebears were to carry nigger
slaves. And though the masses are patheti-
cally anxious to get away to Protectionist
lands like Canada and the United States, they
are very slow to unlearn the Foreign-trade
patter of their school-books. So, though the
position grows more and more impossible,
and though the need for a more general dis-
tribution of human woe grows more urgent,
it is unlikely that anything very special will
happen in Father Bull’s Country this win-
fir—except the winter itself.
Sydney and Singapore.
“Why should we burden our taxpayers with the
cost of creating a naval base at Singapore, when
Sydney is available, with all the conveniences which
we propose to create at Singapore?”-— Col. Reping-
ton, formerly military correspondent of London
Times.
Repington is simply writing at random and
without knowledge. In the first place, Port
Jackson is not large enough. Even if we
allow that modern battleships could lie from
the Sow and Pigs to Woolwich, the area avail-
able is a narrow strip of water five or six
miles long with an average width of little
more than a mile. This ribbon of harbor,
besides taking a right-angled turn at Brad-
ley’s Head, is broken by half-a-dozen islands,
and thronged with ferry traffic, as well as by
the largest mercantile shipping of any port
in the Southern Hemisphere. The harbor
wasn’t exactly crowded with the American
fleet of 16 small vessels; but they took up
so much room that it is certain there is not
enough for over 30 modern vessels each as
large as the Prince’s Renown, with cruisers,
large and small, destroyers, submarines, fuel,
repair and aircraft ships coming and going
at all hours and all tides. One can only
assume that Repington has never seen Port
Jackson and has an exaggerated idea of its
capacity and equipment; for one thing, he
evidently does not know that it has not a
dock large enough to take a modern battle-
ship. Again, ports with large populations
are unsuitable from the point of view of
secrecy. There is too much shelter for enemy
spies and agents, while with neutral vessels
coming and going daily the state of the fleet,
number in dock, etc., would be always known
to the enemy. But Repington’s strategical
reasoning is even more absurd. He speaks
of Australia and Maoriland being undefended
because the Singapore base will be 4300
miles from Sydney. During the Great War
the Grand Fleet was 14,000 miles from Syd-
ney, at Scapa Flow, an almost unknown
harbor in a group of islands far to the north of
Britain, but close to the enemy’s bases and
the passages he must use to get to the open
ocean. Previously in the whole 150 years
of Australia’s history the Grand Fleet base
had never been nearer tlian Malta (or Gib-
raltar in pre-canal days), again on an island
commanding straits, and 10,000 miles from
Sydney. But if Sydney is 4300 miles from
Singapore the empty, vulnerable North and
North-West is about 2000; that is, 1000
miles nearer to Singapore than Sydney is.
Repington refers to that port being “cen-
trally situated as regards Australia and
Maoriland.” Was Scapa Flow “centrally situ-
ated” as regards the British Isles? Or was
Plymouth in Drake’s time? Or Portsmouth
in Nelson’s? Is Hawaii “centrally situ-
ated” as to the United States, and Bonin as
to Japan?
Loans and Land Values.
Statistician Giblin, of Tasmania, has just
issued some figures showing, among other in-
teresting things, how the land of that small
State is settled. There are some 6,000,000
acres of the island’s 16,000,000 in the hands
of individuals. Five persons hold 385,000
acres, and 92 persons hold between them
over 2,000,000 acres, or one-third of the
total alienated area. There are 5420 hold-
ers of blocks of from 100 to 500 acres; the
total area of these farms is 1,117,000 acres
—considerably less than the area held by
the 92 owners at the opposite end of the
scale. The farm-size blocks in 1913 num-
bered 5161; so in nine years, during which
the public debt has increased by over
£7,000,000, and more than £4,000,000 has
been spent in settling soldiers and others
on the land, the number of these ideal farm-
holdings has increased by only 259. In
the same period the total number of farm-
workers, of both sexes, has increased from
16,945 to 18,693. In 1913 there was only
one Tasmanian squattage exceeding 50,000
acres; there are now six. In 1912 there
were 117,721 acres under grain crops; in
1922 the grain area had decreased to 112,651
acres. Hay and fodder show a similar de-
crease. Grassed land, however, shows an
increase from 508,714 acres to 781,000 acres.
Which, of course, means more sheep and
cow. There is an increase in the acreage in
fruit and potatoes, but with these excep-
tions production in the primary class has
remained practically stagnant for 10 years.
Now t , if only 259 new farmers have been added
to the total number of primary producers, if
big holdings have increased iu number, and
if agricultural land has gone into grass,
where is the fruitage of all the loan money
with which the land has been sown? Gui-
lin’s figures supply at least part of the
answer. Taxable value of unimproved hold-
ings in 1912 was £16,876,785; in 1922 it
was £20,204.955. That increase accounts for
nearly 3£ millions of the seven or eight millions
added to the public debt of Tasmania dur-
ing the period under review. As less than
£500,000 of this unearned increment has been
returned to the State and Commonwealth
by land-tax, it would appear that the general
taxpayers have paid the big landowners at
least £3,000,000 during the past decade as
a reward mostly for keeping the land idle.
It seems a stiffish price. Of course, a simi-
lar lunacy prevails in every State of the
Commonwealth, but circumstances in the
larger States conspire to camouflage the
foolishness more completely than in Tas-
mania, where the whole of the facts can be
focussed within the limits of an understand-
able picture at one eyeshot, so to speak.
Boom Signs.
An ex-banker who went through the excite-
ments of the late ’eighties and early ’nine-
ties in Melbourne sees some writing on the
wall: —
The news that two First National Banks in some
little U.S.A. village had smashed because all their
deposits went to support an unpayable prize-fight
brought the reflection that, notwithstanding its
vaunted Federal Reserve system, the banking business
of the U.S.A. is still primitive. Anybody can start
a bank with the same equipment as the late John
Hancock, Vic. M.L.A., described —-“a hook nose and
a counter.” Banker bred and trained as I am, I never
could understand why the ordinary citizen should
walk in off the street and hand the teller a package
of notes and ask him to keep it for 12 months at
whatever rate of interest he cared to allow. No
fixed depositor ever asks a bank what is its security
or what assets it has to guarantee repayment. It is
all so charmingly trustful.
There is a tendency to boom land values in Vic.
just now, and every day the financial situation is be-
coming more and more like that of 1886-90. Then
the Gillies-Deakin Cabinet borrowed excessively just
as Lawson-McPherson have been doing for the past
six years. Savings-bank and joint-stock-bank deposits
grew in volume rapidly, because foreign loans poured
into the country, and there was a seeming prosperity
of which the canny, the thrifty and the grasping
took full advantage, as they are doing to-day. Pro-
duction began to fall off, just as statistics show pri-
mary production is falling off to-day. The Govern-
ment of Victoria was helped in its raid on British
moneybags by the banks of issue, which opened
agencies in the Scottish cities for receiving deposits.
Thinking Australian banks were as safe as Scottish
banks, fixed deposits for 12 months were lodged in
millions. Melbourne bank-managers were over-
whelmed by an avalanche of cables such as “New
deposits for week quarter of a million” ; “Promised
three hundred thousand from Glasgow next week”;
“Dublin agent says he will deposit one hundred
thousand a week for the next six months,” and so on.
The result was the Associated Banks regularly sent
H.O. circulars to their branch-managers imploring
them to lend money quickly, and to offer to do so
personally. In Melbourne two or three of the more
foolhardy managers forced overdrafts on land-
boomers and share speculators willy-nilly, and told
them to go ahead. Why ? Because interest began in
Dundee or Ecclefechan the day the money was lodged,
and it was a dead loss until, the deposit was earning
its service in Victoria. The deposits, mark you,
were for 12 months, and the loans had no time-limit.
It was bad banking, and the process is being re-
peated to-day.
It is the same with money as with immigrants or
population. They both can be accumulated too
quickly. Money growth to be sound and safe ought
to be slow. There are signs that the Victorian Gov-
ernment, which has been borrowing 10 millions a
year when three or four was all the State could
safely and properly absorb, will be forced to ;stop
borrowing because its interest bill is swelling like a
dropsy. And it seems to one who went through the
last land boom well on the inside that recent land-
values are far too high in and around Melbourne.
To make matters worse, building is twice as costly
as it was 30 years ago. Banks and trustees are too
eager to shake hands with and encourage the buyer
of city properties at up to £.2000 a foot. The pur-
chase, we know, nine times out of ten involves an
advance. And that advance is made very largely out
of deposits representing—what? Not real wealth,
but wealth created by the printing press during the
war and after. It is a rickety foundation on which
to boom values, and a very rickety basis on which
to make valuations'for advance purposes.
Comparisons Which Are Malodorous.
At an Australian dinner recently given in
London, Victorian Agent-General McWhae
presided (all really great Victorians are
named McSometiiing) and spoke in melan-
choly cadences about the respective immigra-
tion returns of Canada and Australia. Scot-
land, according to McWiiae, is “honey-
combed with Canadian migration agents,”
who visit the schools in every glen, and
give lectures in every town. So Donald
and Duncan are forsaking the braes
and bannocks and pibrochs of their fathers,
and their places are being filled by cheap-
labor “migrants” from Ireland —people of
a strange race and brogue, who know not
Knox. Of these there are a half-million in
four western Scottish counties alone.
McWhae was followed by the Federal Direc-
tor of Migration, who said flatly that he was
sick of hearing about Canada, and added:
“As a matter of fact, Australia has gained
and retained as much population as Canada.”
He didn’t add a fervent hope that the much-
boosted Dominion might be eaten by its own
bears, but his voice sounded like that. The
odious comparison between the two masses
of empire has points of interest. In 1921
Australia received 87,938 people, and it sent
away 72,149, so the gain was 15,789. (Next
year was better, the net gain being 38,138,
partly by reason of assisted “migration.”)
In 1921, where the available Canadian figures
leave on, the frosty Dominion received 89,999
people, or only 2061 more than we did. In the
absence of any news about departures it is
impossible to say whether it gained much or
not, but unless the Dominion started to do
extraordinary things in the way of importing
people during 1922 and 1923 the situation, on
the mere figures, is nothing very bad so tar
as this country is concerned. Counting new
babies and new arrivals, Canada’s population
increased a little under, and Australia’s a
little over, 22 per cent, between censuses. It
is in a different sense that the position of
Australia is most lamentable —but it is a
sense which orthodox persons like Agent-
General McWhae and Migration-Director
Hunter and their kind would rather not
mention. It touches on a matter in which
Australia is the horrible example of the
globe---the bloated cities. Canada has one
neighbor and one only—the United States,
whose territory touches it to south, west and
north-west. Sea, and to a great extent
frozen sea for a fair stretch of the year, pro-
tects the rest. The great empty North takes
care of itself, or the climate does the work
for it. No European or Asiatic Power has
a show to take Canada without first fighting
the U.S. to a finish. If the U.S. takes the
place itself—well, Canada is so like Uncle
already that the change would hardly make
a perceptible difference, so - long as it was
brought about politely. Foreign dangers and
defence problems are reduced almost to a
minimum for the Dominion, yet it has better
defence arrangements than Australia, as well
as more defenders. Australia has.no friendly
neighbor; in fact, all the neighbors that count
for much in point of numbers are the wrong
color, race, religion and most other, things,
and the idea of being annexed by any of them
is unthinkable. Also the whole border is
suited for invasion, barring a strip of desert
coast about the Bight, which is far away
from any probable line of attack. If Canada
should think of holding its long and vulner-
able degree of latitude which divides its
territory from that of the one possible enemy,
it has ' done what it can by massing its
population thereabouts and building a trans-
continental railway system. Australia has
reversed the arrangement by massing its
population in a very much smaller area as
far as possible from all the probable points
of danger, and having no transcontinental
railway. The question of which coun-
try collects the most immigrants _ is,
then, really not north debating. Australia’s
misfortune is that, whether new arrivals are
few or a multitude, the line of effective occu-
pation remains where it was, very low down
on the map, and there is practically no
settlement in the vast regions which must
be occupied or lost, and very little in the
old regions outside the cities.
*
On the Grand Scale.
It is being urged that a number of members
of both Federal Houses should attend, the
British Empire Exhibition at the nation’s
expense. The proposed swindle, as is cus-
tomary, emanates from members them-
selves, and it appears well within the bounds
of possibility that they will bring it off. In
all the States the habit of giving Parliamen-
tarians and their friends periodical bean-
feasts out of the taxpayers’ pocket has be-
come chronic. The communist holiday is one
of the few activities in which socialists and
anti-socialists, rich members and poor ones,

ment, or a distant section of railway. With s
the discovery of an objective, all that re- :
mains for the tribunes is to pack their bags. '•
In the reserved saloon at the station they
will find one whose uniform suggests a tram-
guard ; who to members and their guests is
a stage butler, and to outsiders a stage
sergeant-major. This is the O.C. Refresh-
ments. For the period over which the jaunt
is to extend he will be constantly on hand,
trotting assiduously between the pantry
(whatever it may be) and those who are on
their country’s business. Not one farthing
is expended by any of the tourists till the
trip ends: the Taxation Department collects
the entire bill later in the year. The Federal
Parliamentary tour of Europe, if it comes
off, will be an assertion on a iarge scale of
the principle that legislators and their fav-
ored servitors have a right to be amused at
the expense of their employers. The excuse
will, of course, be that the members, by their
presence, will give Australia a valuable
advertisement. Actually, what these roam-
ing politicians will do in every centre to
which they make their convivial way will be
to deepen the impression, already widely
held, that our governmental system is riddled
with dishonesty and extravagance. Mem-
bers have no authority or justification in the
world for these costly trips except the fact
that they are in the position to take them;
and every thief who walks off with an un-
guarded purse has that much excuse for his
action.
“The Kidman Blight.”
Norman Fokd says a further word:—
“Ograth,” “Bogan” and “Ularara” having taken
the veil of anonymity are not worth replying to. Mr.
Bedford characterises as untrue my statement that
Queensland leans on the capitalist for money to
“blew” on State enterprises. Quite naturally he
would, for is not Randolph Bedford a self-appointed
spruiker for the Queensland Government? But Mr.
Bedford's mere assertion to the contrary carries no
weight whatever when put against the official figures
relating to the State cattle stations, State butchers’
shops, etc.; and if the money to embark on these
schemes was not raised from the capitalist, I would
like to know whence it came. Certainly not from
workers like Mr. Bedford and me, for, according
to another member of the A.L.P. (Mr. Lazzarini), one
of us must be on the “bread line.”
Mr. Bedford says that Sidney Kidman prosecuted
certain “bush rustlers” in the Northern Territory in
1918, This is not so. The alleged “duffing” was
done in Queensland and the case was decided at
Cloncurry. He further says that it is men like Mr.
Kidman who keep the Territory back. But Randolph
B. only says that with his tongue in his cheek and an
eye to the main chance. He knows that the Territory’s
only hope of salvation lies in the North-South rail-
way, and until that eventuates you’ll see very few
sheep-selectors venture there. But the Queensland
Government wants the railway to be built largely
in its own territory, and Mr. Bedford's remarks are
governed accordingly. One thing in Mr. Bedford's
effusion pains me. His Americanisation apparently
grows apace. In his brave days of old, “duffer”
would have been the term applicable to the purloiner
of another man’s live stock. Now it must be “rust-
ler.” I wonder whether association with American
loan money is the cause, or has Randolph B.
developed the “pitcher” habit!
I still contend that this suffering country of ours
needs a few more Sidney Kidmans. He has gone to
the great Outback, and there are still many mil-
lions of acres available out there for those who
desire to emulate him. Close-up 40 years ago
Sidney Kidman was in the Macdonnell Ranges, the
nearest railway at the time being at Hergott (now
Marree), roughly 400 miles distant. To-day the
holdings he is interested in are still amongst the
farthest out in four States. No monopolising large
areas of arable land for him! But with all this
country available the trend is ever towards the gas-
lit areas. You don’t see the Bedfords and the Nor-
manfords going out back, not 'even when their assist-
ance might be very valuable —say, in connection
with the rearing of a litter of “wild cats.”

The Teacher’s Trade.
By a man who has learned it: —
The road to promotion in the Education Depart-
ment of N. S. Wales is paved with vexation and worry.
A teacher’s status is determined (a) by examination,
(b) by efficiency, and unless he gives satisfaction
in both sections he can whistle for an increase in
salary. Grading by examination was necessary under
the old pupil-teacher system; a man then entered
the service without a ready-made education and
gained one as he went along. The examination at
that time marked definite degrees of personal attain-
ment, and served a very useful purpose; but the
plan is now obsolete, as prospective teachers are
required to show educational attainments many
years in advance of the work to be taught. Further
cramming on the part of the teacher serves no use-
ful purpose and is time wasted. Once a teacher has
mastered all the difficulties in the work required of
him he should be given a free hand in coping with
the difficulties of his class; that is to say, after he
has been given charge of a class he should be graded
according to the efficiency with which he instructs it.
If personal attainment were the great factor in
teaching, why not employ University professors
on primary as well as higher work ? It is notorious
that some of the most brilliant scholars in the
service never were good instructors, while many of
the best teachers are still struggling along in Class
111. Educating a man out of sympathy with the
standard of work required of him is as harmful as
putting him to instruct in work beyond his own
standard of attainment.
The obvious way out of the difficulty is to remove
the bugbear of examination from the teacher’s life
after he has qualified himself for the practice of
teaching. Thereafter he should be graded according
to the inspectors’ reports on the quality of his work.
Such a course would enable him to devote all his
energies to the work in hand, instead of dividing
them between class-instruction and useless exami-
nation-study. The two activities tend to crowd each
other out; either one or the other must receive
special treatment. Systematic work in both impairs
the teacher’s health and vitality, with undesirable
results to his efficiency as instructor, good health
and plenty of opportunity for taking health-giving
exercise being as important for master as for pupil.
Again, elimination of the examination system would
obviate such incongruities as the paying of vastly
different salaries to men performing the same class
of work in the same school—a thing that breeds dis-
content and affects smooth working.

The League of Nations is doing its best with
the drafting of a disarmament scheme. It
proposes that all well-disposed States shall
reduce their armies and fleets and war ex-
penses, and then guarantee, each other against
unprovoked aggression, so that the dimin-
ished force may be a common force, and
thus suffice to go round. In a sense that
is a repetition of 1914, when Britain, France,
Russia and other Powers guaranteed Bel-
gium against unproyoked aggression. If one
or two States stand out of the disarmament

movement, and their resources prove much
larger than was anticipated (resources stowed
away, say, in Central Asia, might be difficult
to audit), such of the guaranteeing and par-
tially-disarmed Powers as come up to the
scratch may have a strenuous time till they
get into their old fighting trim. (There
will, of course, be some defaulters, just as
Germany defaulted on its obligations to Bel-
gium and Greece on its promises to Serbia. )
The new arrangement, should it come off,
won’t necessarily make the war shorter, for
if the combatants begin with 50.0C0 trained
soldiers apiece, and rush recruits into the
field as they go along, it will be much the
same as if they began with half-a-million
apiece, and so had 450,000 fewer recruits to
rush into the field later on. And they should
have more money to fight with, having saved
a lot of military expenditure between wars.
It is hard to say that the League plan is a
first-rate plan, but as that shadowy body
can’t raise a world army, and with it wholly
disarm everybody, including itself, nothing
better seems possible. It is noteworthy, by the
way, that at this particular moment a great
Social Democratic Congress in London has
declared for a citizen army and the liability
of every man to serve. Social Democrats
have always been accounted a mild flock; but
maybe they have an idea at last that the
man who knows he will have to fight if there
is any fight.ng to do will take a of trouble
to see that mere is none to be done. As a
supplement they might push the idea that
the first Lne to be called up should always
consist of the men between 45 and 60.
Touching a “mutiny” in the R.A.N.: —
Some preposterous stuff has been printed about a
“mutiny” aboard the Geranium during the voyage
that ended so injuriously for that fast and favorite
sloop--it struck an uncharted rock in the Gulf of
Carpentaria. There was no mutiny, nor ever any,
danger of one. The trouble had its origin in the
oopiousness of the crew’s vocabulary. An officer
having expressed pain at language used in his hear-
ing, some mostly-mischievous youngsters took advan-
tage of the lights being low to give him a special
display of their talents. While the entertainment was
in progress there was a startling roar of “Bring us a
rifle!” It came from an excited seaman who had
hooked a shark and wanted to complete his job with
a bullet; and that must have been what the tribe
of scoop-hunters had in mind when they ferreted out
their mutiny. In time to come the R.A.N. will be
increasingly employed north qf Caprieornia. While
the authority of the quarter-deck must be preserved,
every reasonable allowance will have to be made for
the feelings of men cooped up in hot steel ships, fed
on a monotonous diet (it is sometimes poor as well
as monotonous) and subject to the provoking mala-
dies of the tropics. Otherwise the service will become
less and less attractive to adventurous youth. A year
or so ago, in the transient enthusiasm excited by
the Washington Conference, the Department of the
Navy reversed the policy followed since 1911, and
encouraged men to quit before they had completed
their time. They quitted in such large numbers
that there is now an admitted shortage where there
was supposed to be an excess. Incidentally, this fool-
policy has led to the employment of young English
officers who don’t understand the Australian tempera-
ment.
That lady who writes to the papers sign-
ing herself “Mother of Multitudes’’ really
exists, and Chief Justice Irvine, of Victoria,
has reluctantly given her a divorce. Th<*
case was based on an English marriage
law which still prevails in the Cabbage Gar-
den, and possibly elsewhere. But it pre-
vails so obscurely that even Irvine ex-
pressed his surprise, and postponed Ms deci-
sion that he might look up authorities and
make sure that learned counsel wasn’t taking
liberties with his leg. The applicant was a
small woman whose age the papers reported
variously as 44 and 51. She had been the
mother of 22 children in three separate fami-
lies. The first husband died. The second,
who was the deceased husband’s brother,
separated but didn’t die. She. was conse-
ouently not married to the th : rd husband.
The point which was put before his rather
staggered Honor was that, under this quaint
old statute, marriage with a deceased hus-
band’s brother was legal, and the children
born of the union were legitimate, unless
and until one party got tired, which might
be at any time before death, and asked to
have the wedding annulled on account of too-
near relationship. Then it became retro-
spectively null, and the children became re-
trospectively illegitimate. (Supposing the
children were grown up, and had inherited
property, say, from an intestate uncle, as the
legitimate sons of Smith, and they suddenly
lost that qualification, and the money be-
longed to someone else, and they had already
spent the money, more complications wouid
doubtless arise.) The little woman of vast
experience asked legal separation from her
second partner so that she could marry her
third one, and legitimise one set of children
at the expense of the other. His Honor
admitted that he was annoyed as well as
taken aback, but the mouldy old statute was
adamant. As there may be more curious
old statutes lurking in the shadows it might
be as w r ell to have a brand-new marriage en-
actment, good for all the Commonwealth,
which will supersede everything that went
before, whether known or practically fallen
out of memory.
“Tin Hat” : No matter what else the State
Parliaments may do in the way of solving
the apprenticeship problem, they will fail
if an increased wage is not provided for the
budding artisan, particularly in his first year.
It isn’t enough to create a large number of
vacancies, and sit back in expectation that
the jobs will be rushed. A lad of 16 years
commences his apprenticeship at from one-
third to one-quarter of the pay he would
command unapprenticed; and, in addition, he
has usually to purchase an expensive kit
of tools. Consequently it is only the boy
whose parents are longsighted and self-sac-
rificing who starts under indentures. The
employer justifies himself with the excuse
that he is losing money while teaching the
boy; in the light of my own practical ex-
perience, I say this is rubbish. While learn-
ing, the apprentice is kept busy, and his pay
is so small that very little production is neces
sary on his part to show a profit. .As a matter
of fact, an intelligent boy in his second and
third years will turn out more than hail
as much work as a journeyman who is get-
ting four or five times his wage. As for
the quality of the work, the article is sold
at one price, by whomsoever made. I dis-
agree with “Te Babarantiko” (B. 26/7/ 16)
that the majority of apprentices are kept on
unskilled work until the last year, and then
hurriedly rushed through the rudiments of
their trade. Apprentice labor is too valuable
to be wasted in such a manner, and most
employers are fully alive to the fact.
“To-Po” : Each teacher-recruit in Vic. must
undergo a rigid medical examination. First-
class lives are held up by the score pending
the cleaning up of teeth, eyes, nose or throat.
Finally, agents of the big life-assurance offices
swoop down on all certified physically and
mentally sound. Assurance for a small
amount is compulsory; the Department holds
the policies, and sees that premiums are paid
punctually. No one seems, to know why the
Government doesn’t insure its own employees.
The offices have to “load” every policy they
issue in order to pay for the high cost m
roping in the policies; the Government would
escape that expense. Also, the collection or
premiums would cost next to nothing it tne
Government did the job; and these selected
policy-holders must be above the average i
quality. So, by compelling their teachers to
insure with outside offices, the Governme
is requiring them to contribute to va™
expenses and provide for certain contuio -
cies which are cut out in their case, i
policies should, of course, be endowment ,
maturing at the retiring age. They would
thus provide the retired teacher with a i
more cash for his final fight with the world
after a long course of specialist-work has
fitted him for any other occupation. As a

POLITICAL
POINTS.
On Billy’s latest bolt: —
Last week Hughes crossed the floor to vote with
the Labor party for the first time since the Con-
scription break. The incident was hailed as a con-
firmation of rumors that Billy is working for a
rapprochement with his old comrades. Personally,
I think the majority of Labor members would wel-
come him back on the easy reasoning that the
question originally separating them is now as dead
as Moses, and that he is still a Luborite at heait
he made this declaration more than once during
his long reign on the Treasury benches but the
trade-unions would have to be converted first, and
they are still hostile for the most part. Anyhow,
while yarns are flying about regarding Hughes s
future movements, his separation from Bruce and
the majority of the party is complete. He must
have reflected on what an apt pupil he had trained
when his quondam Treasurer bulloeked the Estimates
through a long sitting on Friday and Saturday. The
behavior of Bruce was thoroughly Hughesian. Had
the little fellow been there to watch the softgoods
merchant operating the guillotine he would surely
have said to himself: “There but for the disgrace of
the electors go I.”
The expulsion department of the Sydney
Labor party has had another strenuous week.
As a result of its researches in the selection-
ballot industry, Bailey, M.L.A. for Goul-
burn and A.VV.U. boss; Buckley, railway-
union secretary and ex-M.L.A. for Sydney;
Bramston, a Sydney alderman; and Suther-
land, a late member of the A.W.U. executive,
have been outed for life. They are alleged
to have been concerned in, or privy to, the
manufacture or use of ballot-boxes with slid-
ing panels, which comprehensive accusation
they repudiate with rage. Smith, JYI.L.L.,
who opened his heart to the A.L.P. confer-
ence about the movable panels, was dis-
qualified for two years, evidently because
he hadn’t opened the organ earlier, and a
similar sentence has been imposed on Mtna-
lian, M.L.A. for Sydney, and the richest
man in the party, for having ignored a sum-
mons to give evidence. The expulsions
(others are on the way) are expected to
last till the next conference, if not sooner.
Life would be a blank for the Sydney Labor
bosses if they didn’t expel each other every
few months.
Because of shameful bungling, and worse,
farmers whose war wheat was comman-
deered by the Sydney Government got less
out of the pools than those in other States
Border cockies who were allowed to send
their 1916-17 wheat to Victoria drew 4s. 2*d.
a bushel, less rail freight, from the Vic.
State Wheat Board, whereas the N.S.IY.
grain-growers who traded perforce with Syd-
ney received 3s. 3d. at siding, after long
years. And then it was given out that,
owino- to circumstances more or less mal-
odorous. including the “disappearance of
2149,000 bushels—one-fifteenth of the quan-
tity put into the pool—they had been over-
paid to the extent of £855,000. A Compen-
sation Board, reporting a year ° r s ° ago,
recommended a reimbursement of £54J,00U.
The Government says it has paid this money
to the Australian Wheat Board, which ap-
plied it to the reduction of the £BOO.
debit. Bruxner, the Progressive leader, con-
tends that those who put wheat into the
pool are entitled to the £049 000, since,
according to a firm of accountants, they wouiu
have got £1,500.000 more than was actually
paid to them if the administration hadn t
been too rotten for words. The argument
shouldn’t be allowed to drift into a political
crisis, but all the equity is on Bruxners
side Not for 10 times £049,000 can N. S.
Waies or any other State afford to have it
said that it seized private property, wasted
it and refused to compensate the owners
(growers, of course; not scnppers) to tne
extent of the waste.

is exhausted for two years ahead. The im-
ported “reformer’s” denunciation oJ
“saloons,” which don’t exist here as he knows
them, is wearisome ; and so is his denuncia-
tion of most other things. As a rule, he
can’t reform worth a cent, because he doesn t

fishing pushing in to advise cockles whose

The utter failure of the first attempt to
convert (that is, renew) the 1923 I ederal
loan, and the desperate struggle which the
second attempt involves, ought to set even
a few politicians thinking. We have
£900.000,000 of that sort of chicken to come
home to roost within the next few years;
and when we’ve a few pounds in hand that
might constitute a sinking fund and save our
national life some day, there is a mighty
yell to mop it, mostly in some rotten extrava-
gance. . . .
The pacifists of Adelaide, consisting largely
of University professors and politicians,
marked the anniversary of the start of the
war by passing some solemn resolutions to
the effect that there should be no more war,

war- but if disarmament will produce
peace, let’s first try it on the dog by seeing
if the disbandment of our own police iorce
will stop burglary.
Some words of comfort from Brisbane.
Describing the fear of a Japanese invasion of
Australia as “simply ridiculous,” and asserting that
Japan had no intentions whatever towards us, Dr.
Sakuri, leader of the Japanese section of the Pan-
Pacific Scientific Congress, which arrived here to-
day emphasised that all Japan was seeking was
“prosperous trade and intellectual co-operation.
It is wholly gratifying; still the doctor,
buried in scientific research, may not know
all the intentions of the Emperor and the
Ministry. Also, Japan may get a new Em-
peror and Ministry, and new intentions. A
quarrel might even arise out of divergent
views concerning the “trade” and co-opera-
tion ” It did in the case of China. Any-
how, little is heard of the Japanese menace
nowadays except from Japanese who assure
us that it is absurd to keep armaments. Yet
Japan is a walking mass of them perhaps
for fear of an Australian invasion So tar
as this country is concerned, Nippon is
hereby assured that it may disarm any day.
Practically Australia has disarmed; yet
somehow that doesn’t seem to have affected
Japan at all. It goes on loading up harder
than ever.
Rather than meet Parliament on August
14, the Speck’s Hayes Government has
thrown up the sponge. Finance was its
chief trouble, but loose administration lack
of courage, procrastination and general de-
bility all figured in the indictment, that had
been prepared against the day of ire. Tas-
mania has been going to the bad at the rate
of nearly £lOO,OOO a year. In 1022 the
Government budgeted for a £50,000. increase
in revenue and a £20,000 reduction in expen-
diture, but the House of Landlords promptly
kicked the Budget downstairs. Then a Ros'al
Commission reported that money voted by
Parliament for specific purposes, such as
advances to settlers, has been used lor rail-
ways and other public works, one result
being that expenditure on railway workshops
at Launceston has been run up to £24<,uuu,
whereas the estimate was £BO,OOO. Phis was
too much for some of the Government s own
supporters, and their attitude was so menac-
ing that bluff Premier Hayes announced that
someone else could have his thankless job.
It was his for just a year.
From somewhere above the Speaker
Lang’s speech on his censure motion in N.b. kV.
Assembly came up to expectations. He was heavy
and dreary. His guns boomed all the time, but he
delivered no shel s; and his constant thumping o
the table and ponderous replies to interjections, when
a gay retort would have told, spoilt most of the
effect of such points as he made. Lang is solid;
too solid. He is duller than Dooley who, in his
lazy way, could drop an acid comment on the enemy
now and then. The only thing that can be said lor
Lang’s attack is that it wasn’t more wooden than
Fuller’s defence. In appearance Dooley’s successpi
reminds one of Westralian Scaddan, but the latter
can hit out when roused; also, he has a sense cf
humor.
On a storm working up in the West:
W.A. Assembly is about to struggle with _ the
recommendation of the Electoral Boundaries Gom
mission that five seats be subtracted from the
goldfields, outside the Kalgoorlie-Bouilder central
area, in order that three may be added to the berth
suburbs and two to the agricultural districts. The
scheme is to amalgamate Coolgardie and Yilgarn,
fuse the three Murchison electorates into one, and
let Leonora swallow up Menzies and Margaret. It
is likely to produce lugubrious howls from the Laboi
Opposition, if only for the reason that three of the
doomed boroughs east of the rabbit-fence are safe
Labor seats, and the other two, if they were allowed
to survive, would almost certainly revert to that
condition at next year’s elections. But redistribu-
tion in W.A. is years overdue, and the whole nine
mining districts which it is proposed to cut down
to four have less electors on all their rolls put to-
gether than some single electorates beside the Swan.
The bounty on exported beef cost the Com-
monwealth £121,766 for last financial year.
Queensland collected £100,657 of it. The
other States did most of the paying. One
of the achievements of the Theodore Govern-
ment was to repudiate the terms of the
pastoral leases, and impose new rents at such
an heroic rate that the amount extracted
rose from £686,000 in 1915 to £1,21 <,OOO in
1921. This extra £581,000 per year was ex-
torted on the plea that the cattlemen were
sinfully rich. Then, just as the extortion
reached a climax, the cheekiest Cabinet on
earth demanded a subsidy on the plea that
its cattlemen were shamefully poor Ana
instead of bidding Theodore subsidise hisi pas-
toralists himself by refunding a bit ot the
great rent steal, or else depart to the seventh
cellar beneath the bottomless pit, the Com-
monwealth paid up. Which shows once more
that a truculent State Ministry and a dish-
water Federal one are a poor combination
for the public interests.
On a man who threatens to go far:
The House of Keps. is beginning to accept J. G.
Latham, member for Kooyo.ng (Vic.), as an intellec-
tual improvement on his predecessor. Some go so
far as to say that he is the brainiest man in the two
Chambers. He is certainly a talker who commands
interest, and his grip of international politics, pio-
bably fostered by a lively regard for the League of
Nations, gives him an importance transcending that
of any of the Ministers when the Empire and its
political embarrassments are under discussion. Last
week Latham was easily the most striking oratoi
on the matter of Imperial relations, and his original
sentiments and perturbing conclusions regarding the
Versailles Treaty were much more impressive than
Bruce’s easy generalisations in response. The Koo-
yong man is rather an arid speaker, spurning the
tricks of wit and invective which make Anstey and
Brennan so entertaining. One is entitled to suspect
from his manner that he feels his remarks on foreign
affairs are being awaited in Europe with breathless
excitement. All the same, he is a superior person-
ality who convinces without attracting, in the old
Iceberg Irvine manner. He is also obviously a
Right Thinker of the Irvine pattern, and quite as
obviously has no time for the Labor party. One of
these days the pert Parker Moloney or Blakeley will
remind him that this is base ingratitude, seeing that
it was the second preferences of the toilers in Koo-
yong that put him where he is.
A large but indefinite section of the Ant-
arctic continent has been declared British
property within the meaning of the Act, and,
under the name of Ross Dependency, has
been handed over to Maoriland, with instruc-
tions to make the best of it. Consequently
the Maori dominions are several times larger
than they were a few weeks ago. The Ant-
arctic is constantly represented as rich in
gold and other minerals, including coal. ±he
nearer parts of it are no further from the
o-enial warmth than some of the gold country
out of which fortunes were dug in Alaska,
and the approach to the coast from the tail-
end of Maoriland is a holiday trip compared
with the route round Alaska Peninsula to
the Yukon. The Maorilanders of the south
are accustomed to nipping weather, and hav-
ing finished the longest tunnel in the Britisn
Empire, while Australia was still pondering
over its Sydney Harbor bridge, they may
have a little spare time on hand.
FENCES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Where the great green branches bend
To softly brush the brown road’s end,
An old grey fence with broken will
Goes straggling down the rocky hill.
Once it stood with hard-drawn wire,
A line across the world’s desire;
And “Thou Shalt Not” was written there,
When winds were hot and slopes were bare,
For wandering beasts that need must pass
Its guarded hoard of sweeter grass.
Now the red fungus of decay
Upon its rotting posts is gay,
The wire is gone, the gate is down,
The land within is trampled brown;
Only the line is sharp and plain
That tells of purpose dead and vain.
Green roads and brown roads wind their way
To leafy ends where fences grey
Once barred the path of wandering feet
Through earth’s broad places green and sweet.
The wires were tense, the barbs were raw
That crossed the world with creed and law
And made the greener place within
A guarded secret and a sin....
The posts decay, the gates are gone;
And summer bids the world move on.
.Who builds new fences for the mind
Is surely foe of all his kind.
The trees are full of breezy song,
The sun is good, the days grow long;
And bravely from the hills of truth
We view the wider Land of Youth—
The broad dominions gay and free
Of all the world that is to be.
Laugh down the fences! For the price
Of wire we bartered Paradise!

COLUMN
September 3 has been fixed as the closing
date for subscriptions to the Commonwealth
5 p.c. loan, 1928; the loan which it is to
replace matures 12 days later. So far
about £17,W0,000 of the £88,700,000 has
been renewed or covered by new subscrip-
tions, leaving a balance of £21,000,000 to
be found. The Treasury’s difficulty is to
induce many of the 100,000 who averaged
£2OO apiece to renew their holdings. Small
holders are not responding as readily as the
investment warrants. Many of them took up
the bonds at the height of the war enthusi-
asm, and now disregard the fact that renewal
is as important to the Commonwealth as ori-
ginal flotation was. Terms of renewal are
more attractive than those of the original loan.
For every £lOO converted the holder will re-
ceive a cash bonus of £2 on September 15;
m other words, the applicant for conversion
buys £lOO of stock maturing in five years
for £9B, and will receive 5 p.c. p.a. interest
on £lOO in half-yearly instalments. The new
loan is not confined to holders of the 1928
Bonds; others are invited in on the same
basis, with the right to pay £9B per 100
down, or 18 p.c. on application and 80 p.c.
on September 14. The money has, of course,
to be found. If it, is not forthcoming volun-
tarily,. there are ways of getting it in com-
pulsorily. Perhaps, however, it would be
just as well for the moneyed interests if they
did not drive the Government into anything
in the nature of a capital levy. Still, they
must consider that as an alternative. For
the position simply is that if the money is
not offered at interest, in order to avoid de-
fault the Government must exercise its un-
questioned right to collect it without interest.

Shareholders meet this week to decide
whether another lot of 40,000 shares of £25
each should be issued. As the new scrip- is
offered at par—one for six existing shares
—and prospects of 10 p.c. look assured,
there will be no riot over it. The new
shares are to be paid to £l2 10s.; the balance
will be a reserve liability, and callable only
in the event of liquidation, a very remote
contingency in view of the present great
strength of the C.B.S. Incidentally, it is
that soundness which allows the lucky holder
to increase his interests at par. Paid capi-
tal is now three millions; visible reserves
amount to almost 2f millions. The new
shares will not be fully-paid until the end
of July next year—subscriptions are made
easy by spreading payments over four quar-
terly calls—and capital will then have been
doubled in a dozen years. Expansion has
been rapid recently, deposits and other lia-
bilities, apart from notes and bills, having
moved from 22J millions in 1914 to nearly
34J millions at June 30 last. The C.B.S.
began nearly 90 years ago with a paid capi-
tal of £30,000, and it was not until 1893 that
a million hfid been paid up. Since then leaps
of a quarter-million and half-million have
taken place as follows:
1907 .. £1,250,000 -| 1920 .. £2,500,000
1908 .. 1,500,000 | 1921 .. 3,000,000

The growth of profits as set down in the
introductory table should be considered in
relation to capital expansion. The co. would,
from its published accounts, appear to be
doing not quite so handsomely as formerly:
1912 profits returned 16.2 pic. on capital:
in 1919. when owing to abnormal conditions
the management may have been providing
more for contingencies than in pre-war days,
15 p.c.; for the past 12 months, 14 p.c.
Nevertheless, for every £lOO distributed
among shareholders for the past 12 months,
£4O 13s. went to visible reserves.
Besides the £2,668,489 of reserves shown
in the introductory table, there are innumer-
able accumulations of profit not visible, and
which are held as a sort of insurance fund
against losses. There are three known re-
servoirs in which these accumulated sur-
pluses are held: (1) The 5i millions-odd
of Government securities appear at, or less
than, market value, though it is unlikely
that the bank will have to convert much of
that paper into cash until it matures and re-
turns full face value. (2) Advances are pro-
tected against possible defaulting borrowers.
(.3) The book value of premises is
much under cost;. reconstruction of head-
quarters in Sydney and establishment of new
branches have expanded that account from
£678,961 to £929,846 in two years, but the
increase does not record the actual outlay
for the period, less fair depreciation allow-
ances, a “considerable amount of capital ex-
penditure” having been written off “as
usual.” The extent of these reserves
is known only to the insider, but
that they are very considerable is be-
yond doubt. Since 1914, and excepting the
period of slump, when a number of borrow-
ing accounts went wrong, the banks have had
opportunities previously undreamt of.
Abnormal war conditions lifted interest rates
both on gilt-edged securities and on
advances; internal exchange earnings have
become sweeter and easier since the Com-
monwealth Note Issue Department has acted
as a fairy godmother to that branch of the
banks’ activities; and a great harvest was
won from overseas settlements when heavy
importing . upset international balances and
lifted rates to almost prohibitive levels. The
C.B.S. apparently disclosed little of its
exceptional earnings; almost all of them
were socked aAvay for future use. Of course,
working expenses have been heavier, and
taxes hav x e pressed harder; but earnings had
a good start in the race with costs. Larger
taxes have come to stay, however, and man-
agements which have held on to much of
the easy-money of recent years may find the
accumulations very convenient by-and-bye
for more reasons than that. We shall be
wonderfully fortunate if there are not diffi-
cult years ahead.
Features of the latest balance-sheet are
the increase of deposits by nearly three mil-
lions, and expansion of lendings by about
1£ million more than at the height of the
post-war importing boom :

All liabilities to the public totted up
£35,626,717 at .Tune 30. The bank’s visible
funds amounted to £5,668,489; thus it was
handling nearly six guineas of outside money
for every £1 of its own. Though that pro-
portion is well within customary limits, the
management is providing for further expan-
sion by seeking another half-million of capi-
tal. Notwithstanding the three millions or so
additional accommodation granted to clients
in the year, the C.B.S. at .June 30 had no less
than £53 of every £lOO of the public’s money
in liquid form. The remaining £47 was pro-,
tected by written-down advances and pre-
mises for £63. That means that the whole
of the internal reserves and one-fourth of
the book values of advances and properties
could be lost before a penny of the public’s
money would be in danger. The half-million
of new capital adds to the support, and be-
hind that again is 3i millions uncalled.

Deduct the £17,597 “bonus” to policy-holders
and only £18,805 of profit remains, return-
ing a_ trifle under 61 p.c. on paid capital.
That is the correct way of viewing the year’s
results, because the bonus to insurers is
no more than a book entry by which the
Merc, maintains an air of patriarchal benevo-
lence to its policy-holders. Holders of fire
policies receive 10 p.c. rebate on renewals,
but the renewal discount in the Mercantile
Mutual is no better than that allowed by
any other office working under the tariff
agreement, and it is unlikely that the office
handles any of it in cash ; the custom of tne
trade is to deduct the discount when assess-
ing the renewal premium. _ To that extent,
then, the £17,597 rebated is merely a sort
of mirage so far as shareholders are con-
cerned.
In the following comparison of under-
writing performances, premiums are included
at full schedule rates, less re-insurances and
premiums' returned, consequently loss and
expense ratios are a little less than they
would be if premiums were taken in net: —

The last line shows how hard the old Merc,
was hit during the past 12 months. Never
before in its 45 years were losses so heavy.
The period was unfavorably for underwriters
the world over, abnormally heavy losses hav-
ing followed unusually favorable ones. These
cycles are a feature of the business; hence
the only satisfactory view of an insurance
co.’s results is to be got by averaging figures
over a number of years. This one reduced its
expenses a trifle, and the underwriting sur-
plus was not quite so slender as in 1917.
when losses and expenses took all except 7.8
p.c. of gross premiums. Last year’s margin
was 8.1 p.c., giving £20,655. But when the
renewal discounts were extracted only £3058
remained. At one time this office nursed
a very select business ; it still does so, but
some years ago the management decided that
the pickings in less select underwriting were
worth having, and its premium figures have
expanded rapidly. The larger business has
added to profits, but, as entries in the in-
troductory table show, the expansion
has necessitated the introduction of a lot of
new capital. During the past 10 years
£158,110 has been got in, together with
£28,476 of share premiums. In the same
period capital has benefited from £83,750 of
reserve transfers.
Last year’s £3058 net surplus from under-
writing was augmented by £15,747 from in-
vestments, making £18,805 in all, and £5OO
was cut out of that for a staff provident
fund. Though the div. rate was one-fourth
less than recent distributions, profits were
£4428 short of the amount required, and
that sum was withdrawn from a contingency
account. A feature of this office is the small-
ness of visible reserves in relation to capital,
due to the largeness of divs. and the rushing
of reserve accumulations into capital account.
There are 404,147 £1 shares paid to 15s.
£303,110), and all visible reserves tot up only
£31,832. Another feature is that no lay-by
is provided for unearned premiums (other-
wise unexpired risks), though, apparently, on
a 40 p.c. basis, approximately £95,000 would
have been a reasonable provision at June 30
under that head. From a strict accounting
point of view, on the published figures,
£63,000 of shareholders’ capital cannot be
regarded other than as a contingent liability
to policy-holders. At the annual meeting
the chairman stated that the marketable
value of assets was much in excess of their
book value, and that the difference “repre-
sented a sum more than sufficient to re-
insure outstanding risks without encroaching
on the published reserves.” That can mean
only one thing: that the co. has, in the
opinion of directors, been put on a sound
underwriting basis only by abnormal condi-
tions having enhanced city-property values
and by slightly cheaper money having lifted
the value of other securities. Apart from
the fact that most insurance cos. maintain
large inner reserves as well as adequate
visible accumulations, w’hat concerns Merc,
shareholders js the value assets would have
if they, and those of other offices, were sud-
denly forced on the market. That is a con-
tingency which should be provided against in
insurance, and requires reserves quite inde-
pendent of any cover for unexpired risks.
Unearned premiums are liabilities, and should
be so treated in published accounts. The
£324,942 of funds at June 30 were not quite
140 p.c. of net premiums. That is fair
strength—if risks are of a good class —but
funds 1|; times premium income are generally
aimed at by underwriters. If the Merc.’s
business continues to grow, the directors will
have to seek additional supporting funds
from shareholders.

N. S. Wales Cremation Co., Ltd. — After
many disappointments, tenders are at last
being called for the construction of a crema-
torium on a site near the Rookwood (Syd-
ney) cemetery, and furnace and equipment,
costing £925, are on order. The first section
of the building is estimated to cost £3500,
but designs provide for additions which will
require about £2500 more. At present suf-
ficent capital is not available to finance the
complete scheme : at June 30 the cash account
totted up £2OOl. the balance of paid capital
(£715) having been absorbed by organising
expenses during the co.’s eight years’ battling
to get the public interested. To finalise the
scheme capital has been increased to make
60,000 shares of ss. each available, and, the
Cremation Society having become active
again, the directors “have no apprehension as
to the shares being disposed of.” Present
shareholders are probably not so much con-
cerned with the investment prospects as with
the hygienic aspects. From thatnMntArf

years ago a cash bonus of 25 p.c.
(£30,000)_ was distributed, and it was
accompanied by a similar bonus in scrip.
Since the reconstruction 10 pc- has been
paid regularly on £150,000 of capital, and a
visible £8332 has gone into reserve. The co.
may have done better than that; £3500 has
also been laid by in renewal accounts, and
in the past all replacements have evidently been
provided out of current revenue. The £ll,OOO
which had accumulated in these specific re-
serves at the time of reconstruction proved
to be accumulations of genuine profit. The
Hotel Metropole has been a great money-
spinner for the people who had the pluck
to take it off the hands of the Melbourne
crowd who established it in the boom days.
Besides the handsome cash bonuses (in 1910
and 1920) totalling £71,877, one-half of the
present capital of £150,000 was issued as
bonus scrip.
After providing for various contingencies
the net profit for the past 12 months was
larger than for any other year in the intro-
ductory table, notwithstanding that the
drought had restricted business and that
£30,000 of revenue-earning investments dis-
appeared in the reconstruction three years
ago. Evidently the management was in a
position to take full advantage of the slight
fall in commodity prices. The co.’s position
has become a little snugger:—

Profits shown in the table for the past half-
year are larger than those claimed by the
directors. Besides the net earnings of
£6385 disclosed in Profit and Loss account,
a surplus from an unspecified source has
reduced goodwill by £l5OO, and reserves have
also expanded without explanation. Evi-
dently they include amounts which were set
aside for taxation, and if they are extracted
when assessments are received the co. may
not be quite so well off as the latest balance-
sheet suggests. Anyway, that apart, Man

junction with the 1920 reconstruction, which

The odd little Northern Territory Land
Co., in Adelaide, has issued its 42nd annual
report without departing from its accus-
tomed brevity: “There has been no oppor-
tunity of dealing with the company’s land
during the last year. The income of the co.
is sufficient to cover expenses.” The whole
story is that the co. got its speculative hands
on 73,000 acres at 7s. 6d. an acre, and has
never been able to unload; but' the £3OOO
invested in Government securities brings in
an income that pays the modest 12 guineas
for directors’ fees and £2B for “charges,” and
even the double land-tax, now £94 10s. John
Barker is chairman of a strong little Board.

Rumors of Broken Hill amalgamation
have been rather more insistent than usual
in the last couple of years, but, excepting
the transfer of the British to an Australian-
owned co., there have been no definite moves.
With the Baillieus in the background as
underwriters, the British transfer was
effected by the South, North and Zinc Corp.
each taking up 50,000 shares. Consolida-
tion of interests was not the only objective
in that deal; the British co., under Wood-
head, was an awkwardly-placed pawn in the
game which B.H. interests were playing with
the Associated Smelters at Port Pirie and in
the metal markets. Now, as a sort of bold
knight, the North Co. proposes to absorb the
British lock, stock and barrel by paying in
cash and its own shares “the equivalent of
about 235. 6d. per share.” Obviously these
terms, following upon the liberal ones which
effected the transfer of the British mine
to an Australian register, will be readily
accepted by the British-Australian crowd,
not overlooking the Baillieus themselves.
North shareholders will be called together
before any agreement can be finalised, and
an increase of nominal, capital will also be
necessary to accommodate the deal. From
the meagre details given so far it is difficult
to sort out the motives behind the deal or
the weighty reasons which prompt North
manager Weir to join British manager Cyril
Emery in bestowing blessings on a merger
which is to link a twice-reconstructed low-
grade show with the very solid North. Light
ought to be let into several dark corners be-
fore North shareholders put their seal on
the agreement.

W. C. Easdown’s find of gold, diamonds
and sapphires in the terraces at Wvangla,
on the Lachlan River, 25 miles from Cowra
(N.S.W.), has prompted the formation of a
£20,000 co. which proposes to sluice the
area on a large scale. A quarter-mile away
is the “Old Rush,” which was worked for
diamonds 25 years ago. _ For some time a
syndicate, in which ex-Prime Minister J. C
Watson figures, has been testing the ground.
Ten shafts have been bottomed (average
depth 25ift.), and sampling has given an
average gold return of ss. Bd. per yd. Con-
sulting-engineer Robert Gregory upholds
these values in his checking, and calculates
a proved area containing 190,000 c. yd.
worth ss. per yd. in gold alone, or a total
of £47,500. It is proposed to instal a sluic-
ing plant (to cost about £4500) with a capa-
city of 480 yd. per eight-hour shift, and
Gregory works out costs at Is. per yd. So
if only 4s. per yd. is recovered, there appear
to be good prospects in the block already-
proved. Diamonds and sapphires are sweet-
eners to the gold: numbers of both have
been unearthed in the preliminaries ; six dia-
monds were found in 7|yd. of wash-dirt, one
being worth seven guineas, and the sapphires
have proved to be of commercial value.
Special gem-saving appliances are to be put
in. The co. takes over 80 acres, so if all
goes well on the five-acre block proved there
is ample ground for further attention. In
the float 10,000 £1 fully-paids go to the
syndicate and only 7500 contribs. are to be
issued, but most, if not all, of them will
be taken by syndicators or their friends.
W. C. Easdown is taking the whole of his
cut in scrip.

Another interesting N. S. Wales gold-
sluicing proposition is receiving _ attention
in Sydney. The Turon Gold-Sluicing Syn-
dicate, in 80 shares of £lOO each, is being
formed to take over five acres at Golden
Point, f-mile above Sofala. E. A. McCarty
and J. S. Chisholm have checked up the
ground and are satisfied that “the minimum
gold contents should not be less than Idwt.
per yd., and from information obtained on
the ground, rich patches of -Joz. and higher
are likely to be obtained.” With a 340 yd-
. sluicing plant costs are estimated
at sid. per yd., and on that basis
grade is expected to show a working profit
of £26 per day. The 36 contrib. shares—
-24 are to be issued as fully-paid—will be
called to £5O each, arrangements having been
made to defer portion of payments on plain
the promoters expecting sluicing to soon
cover that.
Since taking charge of the reconstructed
Gibraltar, Adelong (N.S.W.), in May, C.
Lonsdale Smith has had his usual luck. After
spending several weeks in unwatering shafts,
he selected a spot south of O’Brien’s shaft
at the 400 ft. level, and cut right into a 9in.
lens of mineralised stone, with virgin ground
above and below. The make is widening
as it is being worked on. A sample assayed

Ivanowna Red Hill (W.A.), which had a
run of bad luck at the time of the Hampton
boom, has lately had a turn-up. Gold win-
nings now amount to a couple of thousands,
and a few more thousands are estimated to
be in sight. At the start capital was in-
adequate to open up the rich veins and to
break sufficient payable ore to keep the mill
going. When finances become easier, Red Hill
should carry on profitably for years.
* * * *
London interests are looking into possi-
bilities in the big gold-ore deposits at Wiluna
(W.A.). Years ago two English cos. spent
large sums on plant and development, and
extracted many thousands of ounces. But
costs swallowed everything, and finally dis-
heartened shareholders called in a liquida-
tor. There is sufficient ore in sight to keep
a couple, of big mills going for years, but
unless the deposits are tackled on a big
scale by a co. with large cash resources
operations are doomed to failure.
Ives Reward (W.A.) reports that two
small crushings have given good results, and
“substantial profits” are promised when the
new 10-head mill is up and started. But
shoots are short, and the co. may. have diffi-
culty in keeping the plant going. The
Mines Department is assisting the co. with
a loan of £3000.^
Lake View Investment, Ltd., a London co.
which at one time owned mines in, the West
but is now a “financial corporation,” received
£26,565 in divs. and interest for the year
ended March 31. Expenditure ran into
£7031, and the directors paid a 6 p.c. d'iv.
and carried forward £5753. The co. holds
nearly a million Burma Corporation shares
and a hundred or so other interests, the lot
having a book value of £1,038,056.

From Kalgoorlie:—
If amalgamation of some of the big mines at Kal-
goorlie had been considered before ore reserves had
been so deeply cut into the Golden Mile could have
been most advantageously grouped into four big cos.:
1 Oroya Links, Associated Northern and surround-
ing smaller shows, such as Paringa, North Kal-
gurli, etc.
2 Kalgurli, Hainault, South Kalgurli, Persever-
ance and Associated.
3. Gt. Boulder, Ivanhoe and Horseshoe.
4. The present Lake View Star group.-
Petty jealousy between the cos. and the abolition
of some snug billets were the chief obstacles.
The mines are now in such a decadent and decre-
pit condition that amalgamation is out of the ques-
tion, and the only hope of saving) the field is by
the establishment of one central treatment plant.
The present cost of production is not entirely l due
to high wages, the price of stores and the depth
of workings. Obsolete methods of winning and
transporting the ore,, and the still more obsolete
treatment plants and systems are weighty factors.
At one time Kalgoorlie led the world in mining and
milling practice; now its name is a byword. Cer-
tainly efforts have been made to introduce a few
modern methods, but unless the old plants are
pulled out root and branch and modern plants
installed, little improvement can be hoped for. But
not one mine looks well enough underground to
warrant this expenditure on its own account.
There are hundreds of thousands of tons of ore
in the Mile just below present pay limits, and the
only way to get it out is for the cos. to pool funds
and erect an up-to-date treatment plant, in a central
position, capable of handling 50,000 or 60,000 tons
a month. There is ample area available for such
a plant on the north end of the Great Boulder leases.
It would need to be run as a customs mill* pur-
chasing ore on assay value.
One objection may be that it would be too costly
to get some ore to the mill, but as the most dis-
tant mine would be only a mile away, and most
under half a mile, delivery by aerial ropeways would
be both efficient and cheap. Anyway, with a
central treatment plant, it should be possible to cut
costs down from about 355. per ton to the vicinity
of 255. Kalgoorlie would then have many years of
profitable life ahead of it.
Since Gt. Fingall, Day Dawn (W.A.)
closed down in February, 1918. the directors
have been trying to dispose of assets, but
owing to the depression in the West they
have failed. It is now proposed to merge
the co. with the London, Australian and
General Exploration. This concern has
holdings in numerous mining cos. in the
Commonwealth and elsewhere, including Fin-
gall. Two of its biggest interests are:
42.665 £1 shares in the Blythe River Iron
Mines (Tas.) and 581,435 2s. fully-paids in
the Australian Maikop Oil Co., Ltd. For
the merger the L.. A. and G. E. is writing
down its 564,718 ss. shares to 2s. 6d. each.
One share fully-paid to 2s. 6>d. will then
be issued for every lOs.-paid Fingall share.
They make a queer pair in double harness —
old Has Been in the shafts and Never Was
in the lead.

“E. J.D.”: The Lloyd George, Gibraltar
(W.A.), has its winze down 72ft. on the
new make of ore near the south boundary.
Official reports give average values of one
ounce all the way, allowing for the poorer
patches. After its gymnastics at 15ft., when
it pitched from west to east, the reef has
followed the latter dip without variation.
The winze is still being punched down, which
suggests that managing-director Alfred
Forbes is not loafing on the job in the hope
that the Carlton lease folk, next door, wiil
be forced to capitulate on terms dictated by
the Lloyd George.
* * * *
Coolgardie has been added to the list of
“oil-bearing regions” in the West. Years
ago a small deposit of oil-shale was found
near the town, but experts pronounced it to
be of no commercial value. The locality
has now been included in a large “oil con-
cession” and is being boosted. However,
Westralia has gone cold on oil ventures.
Coal-mining is becoming more active in
the West. A Perth syndicate is opening up
new seams between Collie and the Gt. South-
ern railway. Bores are stated to have struck
up to Bft. of good-quality fuel, and the
flotation of a co. is mooted. At Collie every
mine except one is now controlled by Amal-
gamated Collieries, Ltd., in which both the
P. and O. and Orient s.s. cos. hold shares,
and which is said to be doing well.
* * * *
Great Boulder’s latest estimate of ore
blocked out is 182,724 tons containing 120,023
oz. (fine) valued at £504,000, but even with
the small premium on gold added this asset,
under present working conditions, is not
worth much. m
Boulder No. 1 has issued a circular con-
taining the usual annual announcement that
the co. is handicapped in its endeavors to
secure a property in Australia owing to
high costs of mining, etc., but that the search
is being continued. # t
The Government drill at Charters
Towers (N.Q.) has completed No. 2 bore
on the Rainbow at a depth of 800 ft. Three
“formations” were cut, one of which ran
to 4ft., but the cores disclosed no payable-
looking stone. This completes about 1400 ft. of
sinking on the Rainbow line, and fulfils the
programme for this part of the field. There
is some talk of giving the Wellington and
Black Jack lodes a test below their bottom
workings. Both are “outside” shows, and
were fairly good for a few years to shallow
depths. The Black Jack produced £70,000
of gold between 1886 and 1889, and alto-
gether the reef yielded about £lOO,OOO. Ihe
Wellington, down to 400 ft., averaged 20z.,
and turned out about £170,000. Easily tne
best of the outside mines was the Stock-
holm ; its lot was about £400,000. It is
surprising that no suggestion has been made
to test the original lode near the bottom
workings of the cross-reef; there is a pro-
mising junction there. #
A syndicate is investigating the possi-
bilities in coal deposits reported to exist in
tremendous quantities alongside deep water
on tbe Pascoe River, York Peninsula, about
100 miles south of Thursday Island. Samples
have been exhibited in Brisbane, and suffi-
cient evidence tendered to warrant a Govern-
ment inspection. Geologist Morton is, there-
fore, making a survey and sampling the
seams. Unless the fuel is of exceptional
quality, there seems slender hope of suc-
cessful exploitation at present, although
there are possibilities in the Java trade. Ihe
field is 700 miles nearer that market than
Bowen is.
* * * *
Great Northern tin, Herberton (N.Q.),
is lifting 150 to 180 tons monthly ; much of it
was found broken in the old workings. That
has accounted for lower-battery returns than
had been expected. The last 150 tons yielded
44 tons concentrates, and averaged just
under £5 a ton. Ore is now being broken
near the new level on a 6ft. lode which looks
very promising. Some of the ore goes well
over 10 p.c., and an average well in advance
of past crushings* can be expected. #
John Brandon’s office was quick in switch-
ing the Waria River Gold and Platinum
crowd into Kaili Gold Options N.L. r lhis
is the spec, engineer Barton sighted when
he had exploded the claims made on behalf
of the Kempf area. The new ground is
“out back” in mandated New Guinea, and a
free option has been granted for six months,
with the right to renew for three months
at £5O per month. The option co. is in
8000 shares of £1; Waria holders have the
right to take up share for share and pay
£1 down, and the vendor is allotted IuOO
fully-paids, but has to pay for them—£ooo
down and a similar amount in three months
—and receives £5OO cash for out-of-pocket
exes, if the option is exercised. If a co. of not
less than £150,000 follows, the vendor is to
get a fourth interest in fully-paids and £lO,OOO
cash. And if the big co. runs into a quarter-
million capital every Kaili share is to carry
seven fully-paids therein and each Waria
share five. But that’s looking ahead: though
“very substantial evidence that the new dis-
covery is a valuable one” was laid before
Waria shareholders in the form of ricn
specimens, B. V. Barton has yet to check
up the say-so of the prospectors.

Many of the Speck’s osmiridium diggers,
have been ignoring the Government pool and
the official agents, and have been marketing
their output on their own account. Others
consider that this competitive selling has.
brought down prices, and an attempt is being
made to bring the rebels to heel. Though
the pooling system is not all it might be-
from the diggers’ point of view, a meeting
representing 117 in person or by proxy de-
cided by 90 against 27 to press the Govern-
ment to amend the Osmiridium Act of 1919
to prevent transactions in the metal except
through licensed buyers, and Minister Blyth
promised to comply with the request* The-
official buyers say they have been handling
only half the metal won, and that unless the
balance goes through the pool they will be
compelled to seek cancellation of their con-
tracts with the Government. #

Capt. Reg Kendall was lost and is found:
Professor Sakurai, Baron Obatu and our other
Japanese scientific visitors laugh at the very idea of
their country having eyes for North Australia ; and
yet—well, hear the queer story of what I lately
found. In my exploration of Cape York Peninsula
1 on one occasion started out to follow the tops of
the ranges, and after a. week’s travelling temporarily
lost my bearings. Just as I was considering the
advisability of returning to the coast aid came my
way in a peculiar manner. Two Japanese arrived
in company with two gins. They had been searching,
they said, for “boys” for their luggers, and carried
cameras, no doubt to aid their quest. This particular
spot was 150 miles from the coast; and I thought
(and still think) it just as easy to catch whales on
the Lachlan River as to find “salt-water boys” so far
inland. On better acquaintance they obligingly pro-
duced a well-made map of the Peninsula, and pointed
out a good track that led from Somerset right down
to Cairns. How they came to possess this map was
best known to themselves. But I’m prepared io
•swear that no Australian has one to equal it.

tinguish between an oleograph and an
Orpen; who would have rejected Sheffield
plate in favor of best E.P.; and who, if
offered a four-poster bed, would have replied
that the family’s stock of firewood was com-
plete. The latest Craze with these misguided
persons is “furniture originally the property
of Governor Macquarie.” They recognise the
name readily on account of its owner’s habit
of plastering prominent Sydney streets, etc.,
with it. and the dealers have taken advan-
tage of the fact to some purpose. There
must be a sufficient stock of shiny tables,
elaborately carved and polished sideboards,
spinets, samplers, cheval glasses and four-
post beds, “originally the property of Mac-
quarie,” to fill half-a-dozen Government
Houses; and all of it is in Sydney. One
reason why I am sceptical is that I have
seen some unquestionably genuine Macquarie
furniture. It is owned by the Antill family,
of Picton —the original Antill was Mac-
quarie’s military secretary—and is just the
stuff one would expect a hardy wandering
soldier of the Macquarie type to possess.
Works of art of a similar solid and honest
quality were often produced in France
shortly after the order “Fall out the car-
penters” had been roared on parade m a

A) is an institu-
tion which Queens-
land knows more
about than all the
other States put
together. Every
little bush town-
ship that can rake
up enough men and
girls holds periodi-
ca 1 dances and
“evenings” to raise
money for “the
Ambulance.” Art-
unions, with a pair
of fowls, a bridle,
a cake or some-
thing else for the
prizes, help to
swell the fund.
With the Govern-
ment subsidy of fl
for fl the amount
raised soon
assumes respect-
able dimensions.
And the Ambu-
lance thoroughly de-
serves every penny
it gets. It’s an
essential of human
welfare m a coun-
try of vast dis-
tances, makeshift
roads and infre-
quent doctors.

“Kenbir”: I can give another reason for
the small percentage of bayonet wounds
noticeable at the hospitals during the war—
the tendency to substitute the rifle-butt tor
the cold steel. More crushed skulls would be
found on Fritz’s side after a charge than
victims of either bayonet- or bullet-wounds.
When the magazine is exhausted the clubbed
rifle is a deadly weapon at close quarters,
and I have often discarded my own sabre
for the more primitive implement.
"Billo C.”: Tallying anything, especially
cargo, is tedious work, as every tally-slave
knows. Taking one’s eyes off the procession
of cases, sacks or whatnot to light a cigar-
ette, or curse a lumper, may entail a mis-
count, and the discovery of a single error
will set abuse, recriminations, blasphemy and
disgust flowing in sufficient
volume to fill any empty
spaces in the ship’s hold.
But my friend Chalk was a
wage-plug of infinite re-
source. He was tallying
bags of chaff, carried per
back by a lively gang work-
ing against time. After a
while his count got so hope-
lessly at sea that he real-
ised it would be about as
reliable as a State Trea-
surer’s financial forecast.
When the point of despera-
tion had been reached, and
the boss was due to appear
with awkward questions,
Chalk noticed a small boy
sitting on the ship’s rail, fish-
ing. Edging artfully to-
wards the side, when no one
was looking he gave the kid
a sufficient boost to shoot
him into the river. Then
he dived over to the rescue,
tally-book and all. He saved
the nipper, but it would have
been too much to expect him
to freeze on to that tally-
book as well. “It ended all right,” he told
me afterwards, “but I had to ask to be ex-
cused when they offered me the Humane
Society’s medal.”
“Whitehall” : It is a pious convention with
Yankee film-producers to make British lungs
preposterous. The latest victim of this pro-
pensity is Richard Lionheart, who, in Robin
Hood,” appears like a particularly crude
denizen of the Stone Age. The most famous
of the Angevins, the monarch whose breed-
ing and good maimers won the reluctant
admiration of the punctilious Turk, appears
first at a splendid joust—a function at
which, in the words of the producer, two
knights are competing “for the champion-
ship.” He is shown tearing with his teeth
at a mutton- or ham-hone, which he holds
in his right hand. For the rest of the pic-
ture, whether the sovereign is on liis throne,
in a banqueting-hall or in the field, he is
invariably tearing some article of foodstuff
—usually a large bone. Forks, of course, did
not arrive in England till the early Stuart
period, but knives were in common use, and
also platters. Richard’s alleged passion for
voracious eating would not be so objection-
able were it shared by his friends; but, on
the evidence of the picture, lie is the only
animal-like meat-gnawer in the realm. He is

AUNTIE: "If that boy teas mine I'll give him a good,

also the only person about with a face like
a Russian moujik of exceptionally low intelli-
gence and a habit of holding - his stomach
when he laughs. Republican propaganda is
all right in its place, but when it sets out to
make a fool of recorded history there is
something to be said against it. However,
if we will take no mea-
sures to establish a film
industry of our own, we
deserve the worst these
Yankee Jews can do
for us.
“Stellsby”: The P.M.O.
at the Government Hos-
pital, Port Said, recently
treated a perfectly white
nigger. Some years ago
I was strolling near the
whaling station at the
Bluff, Durban, South
Africa, when I encoun-
tered a female of the
same description. She
had the shaved bullet-
head, flat nose, thick
lips and high cheekbones
of the conventional
Kaffir, but her skin was
of that transparent pinky
fairness usually asso-
ciated with the ;albino.
Her eyes, however, were
not pink, but green. Altogether, she was
a weird apparition, and I was too flabber-
gasted to observe whether she gave me the
glad eye.
“Esmond”: In the summer of 1918 we
were camped alongside a regiment of Ameri-
can troops who had never been in the
trenches and were breaking their hearts to
get there. One evening a small party of us
were marching up to the line to join the
rest of the battalion, when we encountered
some of our Yankee friends. After express-
ing the hope that the Hun would deal gently
with us, one of them called out: “Well, so-
long, fallers! And remember that it isn’t
everyone who’s got the luck to go up the
line!” “No!” came bitterly from a cynical
Digger, whose illusions about martial glory
had been worn threadbare, “and it isn’t
everybody who’s got the luck that wants it!

A Sydney “boy,” who has paid more atten-
tion to games than book studies, writes from
France: —
Paris is going to the pack as a pleasure resort.
Many of the old eating “joints” and drinking and
dancing “plotches” are down and out. 1 renehnien
are not given to wasting their own money, ami
never were. It was the Russian, Austrian, Hun-
garian, Roumanian and other half-savage dukes,
princes and counts that used to Hood Paris with
coin; but most ot' the foreign noblemen one meets
nowadays could not sit in to a penny-nap game.
The rest are mostly old hard-doers who are on the
make themselves —a man wants to “know it all to
play with them. Young Germans with gilt-—they
used to be the “flashest” and “headiest’ visitois
and the best marks once their blood was up do not
visit Paris now. Egyptian “princes" and Turkish
pashas. ' v ith gold are mostly oh, and young English-
men and Yanks are the chief support of Gay Paiee.
I took a trip to Berlin, but was “tabbed off” right
away, and “given the office” that all rights were
reserved for the local “sports.” Every second soul
in Paris, especially those in the Sport and Pleasure
line, prays every night for the downfall of Commu-
nists and Bolsheviks and the restoration of the Grand
Dukes, princes, counts and other fine wasters whose
good money made Paris what it was but is by no
means now.

“Bosun” : That man was right who wrote
the other day that you can’t take any notice
of seamen joining a ship—it doesn’t prove a
thing as to its seaworthiness. A vessel got
away recently with the water Bin. over the
original Plimsoll mark, and 3in. over the
new Plimsoll; for we’ve never returned to
the pre-war marking. The crew didn’t say
a word about this, though it was, or might
have been, a peril to their lives ; but presently
they solemnly held up the ship because the
chief steward had cut their pickle ration by
a bottle a wetfk.

“Schnorrer” : Bumbles and other notables
of the Holy City dug one another in the
ribs and chuckled at the Lauder reception,
.when a quotation from Burns by Lord Mayor
Lewis Cohen gave Josiah Symon the oppor-
tunity of suggesting that Adelaide’s chief
citizen had Scottish blood in his veins. One
of the oldest-established of British jests is
that no Jew can live in Scotland, and
of all in Aberdeen; but as a matter of hart*
fact Aberdeen had, until two of them were
recently amalgamated, three Jewish syna-
gogues and congregations. Edinburgh, Glas-
gow and all the other Scottish cities of any
size have their synagogues. Rabbi Samuel
Daiehes, who is the religious chief of Aber-
deen Jewry and one of the best-known Jews
in the British Empire, has developed a Scot-
tish accent through much conversation with
McParrich.

“Ex-Dig.” : “Baldy,” “N.P.” and others have
been talking about the Afghan’s aversion
to Pig. It is an aversion which is shared
by people widely sundered from Mahomet-
ans —and Jews too, for that matter. In
my battalion during the war was a Scottish
Highlander who had been canny enough to
work his way to Australia and enlist Where
the biggest pay was to be had. He refused
to eat the breakfast ration of pork, although
a. number of Jews did eat it I don t think
it is generally known that the Rabbinical
authorities had given us a dispensation oi
which verv few of us indeed were not glad
to avail ourselves. Mac., however, preferred
the pangs of hunger to the flesh of hog,
even when our rations were down to 13 to
the loaf.

THE FLOWERS OF SPRING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The grass is green on all the land,
And on my heart, I think, has hold;
And Nature, with a lavish hand,
Scatters its red and blue and gold.
Though this is but a narrow street
That offers me its dingy view,
My heart is full of rapture sweet,
For Spring- has brought me flowers, too.
A blue scarf on her head she wears ;
On pavements dull her feet gleam white;
And in her gleaming arms she bears
A burden beautiful and bright.
I knew her coming when the wind
Her fragrance to my nostrils threw;
And gladness dwells within iqy mind,
For Spring has brought me flowers, too 1
Our door may open to the street;
Our yard with naught but washing bloom;
But springing fancies fresh and sweet
Defy all lingering thoughts of gloom.
My heart is like a garden where
Grow rich desires of splendid hue,
And melody is in the air,
For Spring has brought me flowers, too!
My creditors must wait awhile
For all their money overdue,
But they will bear it with a smile
If Spring has brought them flowers, too!

“Randolph Rentless” : Is there any hunting-
ground for husbands to beat the promenade-
deck of a steamer? A Sydney matron re-
cently returned from a world-jaunt. She
started with four daughters, all of whose
debutante days had been left far behind.
Two of them ceased to be spinsters shortly
after the boat reached San Francisco; a
third found her affinity before England was
reached. On the voyage back the eldest
remained ; but a planter who got aboard at
Colombo with a leg in bandages was so
charmed by the kindness of the lady that he
has asked her to return with him to Ceylon.
OIL ON THE ANGRY WATERS.
“That insolent creature asked me if I remembered how dread-
fully cold it was in 1895!"
"Oh, she didn't mean anything—very likely she doesn't know
what a bad memory you've got, dear!"
“Fax”: ’Tis an ill murder that blows no-
body any good. In Melbourne Practice Court
the other day there was an application by
a barrister, instructed by solicitors, on be-
half of the Curator of Intestate Estates, to
have Airs. Somebody substituted as defen-
dant in place of Mrs. Somebody Else in an
originating summons to determine who is
entitled to the estate of the late Frederic
Sheard. This involved the further question
as to who died first —-Frederic Sheard or his
wife. The other Mrs. Somebody has died
since the originating summons was issued,
and the surviving sister of Sheard, deceased,
must be old enough to die likewise before
the illustrious Law has settled the question
aforesaid. Sheard and his wife were a de-
plorable old couple, living in a filthy cottage
in the Beaconsfield district. It is more than
two years since somebody murdered them for
the sake of their hoard of wealth which
probably had no existence. The Melbourne
police arrested a man for the murder, but
could make out no sort of case. As a matter
of fact, all the evidence the police did not
produce was against the probability of the
crime having been committed by any adven-
turous party from Melbourne. More likely
one or more persons of their own type, cap-
able of withstanding the malodor of their
premises, did the Sheards to death. And if the
police did fluke a discovery of the murderer
the chances are that he wouldn’t be able
to remember which of the aged pair was
the first to go. But hasn’t the Law found
a lovely subject for earnest £ s discussion!
“Hamer”: An incident at Sydney Central
Court last week may excite a doubt whether
civilisation has progressed much since
Palestine was ruled by Pontius Pilate. In
those days, at all events, nobody thought of
dragging any of Christ’s disciples to court
and describing them as “idle and disorderly
persons having insufficient visible means of
support.” Yet that dragnet charge landed
three Yankee sailors—-persons of whom the
police had nothing worse to say than that they
“had queer religious ideas” —before a magis-
trate, The alleged vagrants asserted that they
had received a call from the Lord to go to Pales-
tine ; and they showed that they had already
paid a deposit on the purchase of a 30-foot
boat, into which they propose to put a deck
and masts in order to make the journey.
The men’s obvious sincerity so impressed the
magistrate that he told them that nothing
would happen to them, provided they Started
their voyage—or got work—by September 5.
“Wege-Motor” : “Digger’s Father” is right
about the way military “tanks” got their
name. In London last year General Swin-
ton gave the writer some information on the
subject that is destined for the next “Encyclo-
paedia Britannica.” It was to guard against
spies and injudicious disclosures that these
new implements of warfare were marked with
a notice (in Russian) : “These tanks are
to be used for fresh drinking-water only.”

“Stellsby” : The view of brother “Phthisis”
(B. 19/7/’23) that fears of infection from
T.B. are absurd, provided the patient takes
a few simple precautions, deserves the fullest
publicity, for nothing else willi dissipate
such fears. Take my own case. For some
months I had lived the simple life in the
bush, but found that something more than
fresh air was necessary to arrest the disease ;
consequently I in-
serted an advt. in
the dailies apply-
ing for board
nearer the city
where I could at
least obtain first-
class food. I
warned prospective

Great hearts re-

peal. The first de-
finitely consented,
to take me in, but
upon calling to
make final arrange-
ments I was in-
formed that the
matter had been
thrashed out by
the household over-
night, and my
presence was not
desired. I tried
not to look dis-
appointed, and
forthwith called
upon my second
string, only to find
another prospec-
tive landlady who
had “thought bet-
ter of it.” I am
well versed i n

methods, and pride
myself on follow-
ing them; never-
theless, experience
has taught me that the vast majority
of folk study me sideways, and benignly
prefer my absence to my presence. Truly
this second war is infinitely more terrifying
than the one I fought from 1914 to 1918.
“Yacko”: “D.F.,” discussing who was the
real founder of Australia (B. 24/5/’23),
says that Sir Joseph Banks was the first
to suggest the use of it to Great Britain.
Banks may have been the first to mention
such a thing as desirable, but it was left
to James Maria Matra, an Irish-American
and a fugitive from America after the war of
Independence, to draft an attractive scheme
depicting the many advantages such a colony
would hold for England. He pointed cut that
in the event of war with Spain or Holland,
Australia would he the place from which a
decisive blow could be struck at the sea
power of either, and he also dilated on its
potentialities for trade with China, Japan
and South America. Emigrati n from Bri-
tain in those days was hardly considered
seriously as a means of settling this conti-

neilt; in lieu thereof laborers from China
and the islands were recommended. (The
first suggestion of founding N. S. Wales as
a penal settlement came from Lord Sydney.)
Matra had gained considerable knowledge
of his subject when acting as gunner’s mate
on the Endeavor in 1770; and again on the
Resolution in 1772. In after years Banks
used his influence to obtain for his one-time
shipmate a secretaryship in the British Em-
bassy at Constantinople, and subsequently
Matra was appointed Consul at Tangiers.

“Sixenate”: One of the queerest birds
known to the Australian police is a lady
who was sentenced for the umpteenth time
for false pretences the other day by a Sydney
Judge. Still in the early thirties, she is
practically a habitual offender, who works
on the same lines as that once-notorious Eng-
lish adventuress, Mrs. Gordon Baillie. She
has a taking appearance, a grand air and
expensive tastes ; wherefore credulous trades-
men, readily swallowing her stories that she
is a doctor, or engaged to some wealthy-
squatter (always named), or the sister of
some city magnate, give her goods and credit
and cash her cheques. At one time she
secured some immunity from arrest by dash-
ing away (always in style) to a new capital
when an old one had become hot; but her
game has been played so often that imme-
diately she is out of gaol, and complaints
are made about this class of swindle, the
police are promptly on her trail. Imprison-
ment has no chastening effect in her case;
the last indictment against her showed that
she had worked a swindle an hour after
finishing her previous sentence.

“T.P.’s” pen-and-ink vignette:—
A school “function,” and a deep-chested, bullet-
headed lad with square jaw and permanent scowl
gathering in prizes for both sport and learning,
including the Dux medal. A wee, faded, shabby wisp
of a woman, with past trouble etched deep in never-
ending lines on her face, and shown in her thin,
drooping shoulders and toil-worn hands, sitting in a
seat alone. The boy’s scowl does not lift, even when
his mates make the roof 'ring with rounds of applause
in his honor. A man near me says: “No gratitude,
love or poetry in that chap’s soul; just sordid selfish-
ness. He’ll go far!” Bearing all his spoils the lad
marches stolidly down the platform-steps and goes
straight for the forlorn little figure. For just one
instant his face lights up with pride, love and tender-
ness as he whispers, “Mother, for you!” and. piles
his treasures in her lap, finishing with his medal.
Then he glares at the platform again as if ashamed
of what he evidently regards as weakness. The
woman’s hand steals into , the lad’s big fist; tears
trickle down as she thinks of an Australian soldier
with a hardness in his face that gave no clue to his
tenderness of heart, who fell fighting to save his
mate. His medal lies near • her heart; their boy's
on her lap. The critic near me blows his nose furi-
ously and says: “I was right, after all. He will go
far!”

Many a written ghost.

As a postman's dream.

All the murdered screeds —

Ere the hero reads.

“Lex’s” note on “the Old Brown Jug”:—
Judge Docker, whose name first struck terror into
the hearts of N. S. Wales malefactors some 40 years
ago, died in Sydney on Sunday morning. He had the
just man’s uncompromising hatred of wrongdoing in
any shape or form. Most of the stories that have been
current for years about his pleasantries while sen-
tencing prisoners were apocryphal. They fitted in
with his high, whining voice, his somewhat smug
demeanor and his odd habit of nosing beaver-like
amongst his notes while he uttered devastating rebukes
or passed terrific sentences. Nevertheless there can be
little doubt that he did enjoy himself while inflicting
many of the punishments for which he was respon-
sible. Some Judges hate one form of crime, some

another; Docker disliked a particular type of crim-
inal —the humbug-. The accused who was misguided
enough to try snuffle on Docker always got a bit
extra. He was a tower of strength to the Anglican
Church, giving freely of his money, time and legal
advice in the cause. His beautiful water-frontage
place at Elizabeth Bay held his interest to the end,
and before the break-up in his health, which began
with the death of his wife five years ago, he had
been a patron of big cricket. He was 83 when the
end came.
There was an unusual gathering of
medicine-men and churchmen at the funeral
of Dr. George Edward Rennie m Sydney
early this week. The man whose memory
they were honoring was one of the remark-
able family of that remarkable old man
who was Auditor-General of N. S. Wales for
many years—a man who saw that his ciuty
was to tell the truth as he saw it, no matter
whether it was George Reid _or any other
Treasurer who would be hurt in the process.
Son George was cast in the same fine mould;
only his doctor’s job allowed him to seem
more philanthropic.

N.> S. Wales landed 'Tgenticmah.
Campbell came to Port Jackson from
India in 1797. He traded to and
from India, went sealing at King
Island, and in 1804 raided the coasts
of Chile and Peru, where he cut out
the Spanish war schooner Estramina
from under the guns of shore defences.
His vessel, the Harrington, was seized
and sailed out of Sydney Harbor in
1807 by 50 convicts, who afterwards
. fought 11.M.5. Dedaigneuse off the
Philippine Islands —probably the only
sea-fight ever fought between a King’s
ship and a party of convicts. In a
memorial which he wrote in 1812 ask-
ing for compenastion, Campbell stated
that he had lately discovered a grout)
of islands called by the natives the
Pamootoes, about 600 miles to the
north-east of Tahiti, and likewise a
pearl fishery there “promising to be
productive of much benefit to trade
from that colony.” Campbell was given 2000
acres to console him for the loss of his vessel, and
named it Harrington Park.
“The Deacon”: Lithgow (N.S.W.) lost
its most remarkable resident lately when
Philip Winchester went west. He had spent
the greater part of his 90 years in pioneer-
ing work and in the mines of Cullen Bullen;
but his claim to fame lay in the fact that
a few years back he developed a latent
thyroid gland or something, and though bed-
ridden at the time and ripe for an early
dissolution, he astonished and rather scared
his friends by a sudden rejuvenation. De-
claring that he had slipped back about dd
years he proceeded to grow a complete sun
of thatch on his perfectly bald head, and to
skip about like the young goatlings ol the
adjacent hills. Maybe the solution of
longevity in his case had something to do
with his close attention to hard graft almost
from infancy.
The new R.C. Bishop of Eastern New
Guinea, Dr. Wolf, spent 17 years attending
to the morals of Togoland. In his new king-
dom of 460,000 sq. miles there are a half-
million Papuans to be put on the right path.
A cathedral is to be built at Doilon, the
head station. A leper settlement was also
planned, but Black Brother has a super-
stititious objection to lepers and deals with
them in his own decisive way.
“The Wanderer”: George Boyd, ex-
sergeant of police, who finished his last beat
at Windsor (N.S.W.) the other day, arrested
a notorious person known as ‘Angel on a
charge of cattle-stealing in the Coonamble
district in 1885. While in Bathurst Gaol
“Angel” chummed up with the forger
Thurston, and when they were transferred to
the Coonamble calaboose they disabled the
lockup-keeper, shot constable Mitchell (who
got in their way), and made off. 1 hey then
started business as bushrangers, their head-
quarters being in the Wanumbungle and
Wollar Mountains. Sergeant Burns and
constables McKinley and Day, from Gulgong,
went after them, and in due course both were
shot at Stuart’s store, at Belinfante s
Bridge, a few miles from Mudgee. Burns
shot Thurston, while Day (later Inspector-
General of Police) accounted for Angel,
but not before the latter had shot the store-
keeper Stuart.
W. J. H. Clark, just dead in S.A., was the
Henri Clark once known as a musician in
Melbourne. He was a civil-engineer and
went to S.A. on railway and drainage work,
but he had done great things at piano and
organ—had, for instance, been concert accom-
panist to Melba and Caruso.
Alfred Joseph James, who died a few days ago
at Surry Hills, Sydney, aged 72, was flhe eldest
son of Capt. David Cureton, who gave up
the sea to sell beer at the Three Crowns on
Church Hill, in the ’forties, and later kept
the Grafton Arms in Kent-street on a site
afterwards occupied by the Gaslight Co. It
was a Cureton who, in 1818, on the order ot
Governor Macquarie, built the obelisk in
Macquarie-place as a datum point for the
survey of Eastern Australia.
“T. 0.1.”: The N. S. Wales Government
Printer has published a pamphlet about the
North Shore Bridge. In what purports
to be a summary of the 40 years of agitation
for the structure there is not one word
about the late Norman Selfe. Yet his was the
first design accepted for the work. In
November, 1900, William Dyne, then Pre-
mier, said he “intended to bring in a bill to
enable the Government to go on with the
bridge without reference to the Works Com-
mittee.” In 1908 Mr. Selfe complained “that,
though the successful plans for the N.S.
Bridge have now been retained by Govern-
ment for three years and copied by them, no
communication has yet been received by the
authors as to the Government’s desires or
intentions.” Mr. Selfe told me that he had
not received from the Government one penny
for the accepted plans.
Maoriland post one of its best chess-
players when R, A. Cleland died at Dunedin
the other day. He had been president and
champion of the Otago Club for years, and
had the unique record of winning a M.L.
ohamTfioTisM.p tourney without suffering a
single defeat.
E. J. McConnel, who has been what T. J.
Ryan used to describe as a Beef Baron, is
now qualifying for the title of Cotton Cal ph.
Last season he put 1000 acres of The Plains,
Boondooma. (Q.) under cotton and sent
752,3201 b. of seed cotton to the ginnery. This
would represent something like £lB,OOO at
sid. per ]b. This year he intends to double
the acreage.
Australia gets one of its Rhodes scholars
back to a scholastic job, for R. R. P. Bar-
bour, whose dad is headmaster of Toowoomba
Grammar School (cricketer Eric is another
son), has been handed the Brice McKinnon
mastership at Geelong Grammar. The post
means taking charge of the whole classical
work and receiving £7OO p.a. for doing it—
a considerable distinction for a youth of 24.
R. 11. Edkins pulled out of the United
Graziers’ Assoc, of Queensland the other
day with a cheque for £1250 —five months’
salary to the end of December at the rate of
£3OOO a year. Edkins was a squatter and
business man when the Central branch
pushed him to take an appointment as execu-
tive officer at the salary stated. The cocky
section of the association put its ears back
over the business, and there has been trouble
ever since, the lusty infant Cattle-growers’
Assoc, being one of the most visible signs
of it.
Since he retired from Queensland politics
George Kerr has been looking after his graz-
ing farm in the Central district. When he
took his seat in Parliament with the early
batch of Labor men after the big shearers'
strike —they were the days of Andy Daw-
son, Charlie MacDonald, Billy Browne and
Harry Turley—Kerr was a village black-
smith. He became Minister for Railways,
but later differed with Kidston: he refused
to follow modern Labor to extremes, but
could not swallow Philp’s conservatism. His
best quip at the extremists was: “You always
knew the socialist in the shearers’ mess —he
speared the biggest potato on the dish.”
Memories of Paddy McCaugkan, who built
the Rialto, were revived in Melbourne last
week, when the place was offered at auction
and passed in at £85,000. It is about a
quarter of a century since that enjoyable
week when MeCaughan sued the Akgtjs for
damages for publishing some Passing Show
verse, which he said held him up to ridicule.
The Court roared as Frank Duffy read the
rhymes about Pat’s figure as Lafayette at
a fancy-dress ball —how his back was “an
acre of broad cloth blue, as smooth as a well-
kept lawn,” and how the “flure trimbled be-
neath his tread.” The case sent up the cir-
culation of the conservative sheet, and if the
Mackinnons have not erected a monument to
MeCaughan they should. He arrived when
he was badly needed.
In the early days U.S. Presidents began
older than they do now. The youngest men
to arrive were Roosevelt at 43, and General
Grant at 47. The oldest were the mourn-
ful Buchanan, aged 66, and General Zachary
Taylor, aged 65. Buchanan was 70 when
secession began, and he behaved like 700.
“Jumbo”: Charles Taylor, leader of the
United party and head serang of the Q.
Opposition, is a produce merchant and knows
a lot about the wants of Cocky. Speaking
on the Address-in-Reply he showered praise
so lavishly upon the Government for its
assistance to the farmers that Theodore in-
vited him to “come and play in our yard.”
A. C. Elphinstone, the new deputy-leader of
the Uniteds, dabbles in cement, fruit-growing
and motor accessories. He has a plentiful
supply of ambition, talks well, and is about
the only man in the Opposition who com-
mands attention from Theodore. There is
no monotony about his politics—so far he
has been Nationalist, Country party and
United party.
“W. 8.”: “Chris” (B. 26/7/’23) is wrong
in saying Wiremu Maui Pomare is a full-
blooded Maori. His mother was a half-
caste and his father also had European
blood. I have known Pomare since he was
three hours old, and I can guarantee what
“Chris” says about his medical proficiency.
He was a lad of fine strength of character.
When in the midst of his student’s course in
Dr. S. K. DATTA, of Hyderabad, India, at
present touring Australia he is a jroni-
rank Indian educationist who says that
Hindoo unrest is mostly a matter of
hunger.
Michigan his home funds ceased and there
he was, a stranger in an alien land, 1
threatened wreck of a career. But Po
turned to, and by delivering lecture
Maoriland and the Maori, made possible h.s
passage through continental hospitals, a
finally at Edinburgh he bagged his n*4**l
diploma. No man can grouch at his success
THE GRAPES OF EPHRAIM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The gleanings of the grapes of Ephraim are better
than the whole vintage of Abiezer.” —Old Testament.
Froth up a single glass of dry champagne,
Something that fizzes when the cork out-pops,
And here’s a stimulant I’d sooner drain
Than half a bucketful of malt and hops.
Say, can you picture Abiezer’s crops
When those who filled a bumper to the brim
And tossed it down contemptuously, cried:
“It isn’t worth a tinker’s curse beside
The gleanings of the grapes of Ephraim” ?
Serve me a remnant from that game salmi,
A wishbone and a wing will be enough,
And you may have the beef—-in quantity
Unlimited, but singularly tough.
And fill the chinks up, as you will, with duff,
While I assault with less obtrusive vim
Trifle and souffle. Yours is homely fare,
Like Abiezer’s brews, and mine, as ’twere,
The gleanings of the grapes of Ephraim.
Here is a real Havana, fragrant, rare;
From Midas’ well-stocked case it won’t be missed.
I’d liefer blow it softly in the air
Than half-a-dozen pounds of Barrett’s twist.
It puzzles me how fellows can exist
Around whose heads clouds from cheap woodbines
swim.
The best they burn is, if they only knew,
As Abiezer’s choicest yields unto
The gleanings of the grapes of Ephraim.
The earth is wide and passing pleasant, too;
Give me a scrap of that I loved the best
In days when leaden skies were clearest blue,
And anyone who likes may have the rest.
Forest and rolling plain and mountain crest
Stretching away to the horizon dim
In bright new sun-bathed lands are less to me
Than one grey hamlet that in dreams I see— '
The gleanings of the grapes of Ephraim.

“Pick”: Once a seeker after Abo. know-
ledge asked The Bulletin if there had .ever been
such a severe drought in Australia that the gum-
trees died. I disremember what information he
gleaned from the Council, but had it been now I
could have given him an emphatic affirmative:', In
consequence of the recent long dry spell on the
Monaro Tableland (N.S.W.), in the wide forests of
Mt. Cooper and along the Oak Ranges traversed for
many winding miles by the Nimitybelle-Bombala
railway, the cabbage and ribbony gums, over big
extents of rocky ridges and gravelly flats, stand
withered and dead. And by tne wilted appearance of
specimens on good country the rains of June blew
along only just in time to save them also from pass-
ing it in. Incidentally, the hardier nature of the
hickory, oak and wild-cherry trees was proved. They
continued to flourish healthily like green islands In
the sea of whitened, withered foliage.
“Bill R.”: “Ooslied’s” 76-year-old horse
(B. 19/7/’23) knocks me bandy; but I knew one
hoary old fellow well on the way. He was owned by
Alf Witts, then sheep-overseer on Bibbenluke station
(N.S.W.). 1 hate to tell a lady’s age, but Mrs.
Witts herself cheerfully owned up to 52, and she had
learned to ride on the creamy when she was six
years old.
“J.H.S.”: Recent pars about sawfish re-
call a 16-footer with a sft. saw which was caught at
Baffle Creek (C.Q.) some years ago. It was netted
by Billy Simmonds, Jack Kriedamann and Jimmy
Kafe, when fishing for mullet off a sandbank about
two miles from the mouth of the creek, which is a
very wide one. Despite its great size, the chopper
was landed without much trouble, and, strange to say,
the net —an old and ordinary dragnet—which was
badly tangled about the saw, was not seriously dam-
aged. Over 20 bottles of oil were obtained from the
fish’s liver, and I have a set of draughtsmen made
from the amphieoelian bones of its vertebra'. No one to
whom I show them, however, wants to believe they
were not turned out by a lathe.
* * » *
“Mac Verity”: I don’t think “C.W.P.’s”
yarn (B. 5/7/’23) about spuds sprouting four-inch
spikes sounds at all feasible. But if he wants a real
honest-to-goodness example of transmission of abnor-
mal characteristics, I can give the experience of a
returned soldier and his Repat. hen-ranch. My
Digger friend, who was supplied by a local store-
keeper with pollard and bran for his leghorns’
rations, strongly suspected the petty profiteer of
adulterating the fodder, as it didn’t seem to mash
like ordinary hen-porridge. When his first lot of
eggs were hatched in the incubator the justly-
incensed chicken-squatter had proof that the store-
keeper had put sawdust in the bran, for all the
cheep-cheeping little chicks had wooden legs.
* * * *
“Eureka”: “Condambo’s” accident (B.
12/7/’23) reminds me of one which happened to, a
farmer at Wyndham (South Coast, N.S.W.). Having
finished harrowing for the day, he unhooked the pair
of horses and set out to drive them home. Something
startled the prads, and they bolted. The buckle of
the reins caught in his “rheumatic” ring, and he was
thrown up against a forked tree. The horses careered
on towards home, taking with them his finger, which
had been pulled out from the socket.
“Carisbrook, Jun.” : “The Rumpus’s” tale
(B. 28/6/’23) of his long trek for his letter which
turned out to be from the Dead-letter Oflice reminds
me of a yarn I heard of the famous “Fizzer” of
“We of the Never-Never.” He was mailman for a
large portion of out-back N.T., and trip after trip
out he would find Singapore Joe, a well-known
Territory identity, waiting for his mail. As there
wasn't any, Singapore would .saddle up mournfully
and start on his 60-mile trek back to his buffalo-
hunting. Some of the lads in DaAvin heard of his
void, so next mail Singapore was delighted to have
an imposing-looking letter handed to him by the
Fizzer. Joyfully he tore the envelope—and found
a letter from the Terminus pub, asking for payment
for 20 drinks which would be consumed by the lads
on arrival of his cheque. But Joe was a sport: he
rode back the 60 miles to his camp, drew a cheque
for 30 bob and caught the Fizzer on his return trip.
By the way, it might interest Abos. to know that the
Fizzer packed his last mailbag some time ago—he
was drowned crossing a river. A big white headstone
marks his camp.
“The Overlander”: When the East-West
line was being built at a place on the Nu,Harbor
Plain, three horses got away from a camp and were
written off as “perished in the desert somewhere
north of the line.” Several months afterwards
the animals turned up in extra prime condition.
That railway ought to pay some dayl
* * * *‘
“Jesraond”: I recently came a-oross a
peculiar fungus-like growth in a gum log I was
.bruising at the woodheap. It was growing in circles
round the centre of the block between every third
or fourth ring of the wood, yet there was, no indi-
cation of it on the . outside. In its living state it
had the appearance and strength of white rubber,
but on being dried it lost the rubber-like texture
and became more than a passable imitation of
“shammy” leather—in fact, it is impossible to
distinguish between the two. It has the texture,
strength and “spring” of the real thing, and during
the past fortnight a piece has been in use for window-
cleaning without any apparent signs of wear. Does
any Abo. know what it is, and, if so, of any other
uses for it?

“Pick” : Last summer some miners em-
ployed by the Scotsdale Copper Co. (N.S.W.) were
putting in a drive to cut the reef below the old
workings on the Maloon, and struck the timbering
of a fallen-in shaft that had been sunk 60 years
before. From a yellow-box upright sent to the
surface they subsequently split out the brownish-red,
ringed pupa of a tree locust. For three-score years
this embryo screecher must have remained a prisoner
in the buried log; yet in less than a week after
its exposure to the sunlight the shell parted ' and
the erstwhile Sleeping Beauty was shrilly proclaim-
ing herself from the top of a near-by peppermint
sapling. Do these pupae, when buried, preserve
their vitality for ages?
SHE’D MET HIM AT HIS WEAK POINT.
“Listen to that hoy’s swearing! Awful! Dreadful!”
“Yus’m. Stinker’s no good at the lip. But you should see him hand out stoush!"
“Kenbir”: Among the articles stolen by
a brown bower-bird from my camp in the Mossman
scrub (Q.) was a small compass, 18 brass .Ileal,
cartridges, a penknife, a silver watch chain and
sundry parts of a camera. I recovered the goods
from the playground of the thief, which T located
not 10 yards from the camp.

“Perdix” : Apropos the controversy in The
Bulletin some months ago as to whether or not the
Tasmanian tiger was extinct outside zoos. At the
25 Mile, Emu Bay railway line, a fine female was
caught a few days ago, and is now in the possession
of Harrison, of Wynyard, a well-known collector for
circuses, etc. Specimens are worth anything from
£25 to £75.
# * * *
“Heredot” : Last summer a cat belong, ng
to friends of mine on a North Coast (N.S.W.j far-.i,
had kittens in a box at the rear of the stables. They
were discovered by a marauding fox, who decided
THE NEW GYMNASIUM.
DOCTOR: “I honestly don’t think having a
car is going to do you any good."
PATIENT: “What do you mean?"
DOCTOR: “You won’t get enough exercise."
PATIENT: “Oh, won’t I? It’s a third-hand
one at the very least!"
that a couple of kittens would do just as well as a
hen. He sneaked one out of the box just in time to
be caught by the mother-cat returning from the
kitchen with a large fish in her mouth. Puss
promptly dropped the fish and took to the fox, not-
withstanding that the latter was five or six times
her size and weight, and an epic combat started.
When it had finished the intruder was lying dead,
his throat and the greater part of his head slashed
to ribbons, while one of his ears had been bitten
clean through, so that it was attached by only a
few strands of tissue. The victor, bore scarcely any
indications of the fray, and after giving the van-
quished a sniff or two to make sure that he was
really dead, she carefully replaced the stolen kitten
in the box, and then, picking up her fish, got in her-
self. This is the only time I ever heard of a cat
attacking a fox, let alone killing one.
* * * *
“Gyp”: Kangaroo-rats must have poor
memories and a complete contempt for pain. I used
to set a steel trap at a hole in a brush fence, and one
morning it contained the longest part of a rat’s leg,
llie point of severance showing much shattered bone.
The following morning the same trap was gripping
the remainder of the rat. The stump of the missing
leg' was much swollen and very dirty, but bleeding
had completely stopped.
* » * *
“C. Coral”: The march of civilisation!
I’ve got used to seeing fashion catalogues come
through the post for island natives up this way
(Torres Strait), and even the sight of a naked
islander carrying a breech-loading gun, a suit-case
and a tin of patent food as he stepped off a fishing-
lugger didn’t startle me much. But when Billy
liotumah approached me confidentially with a pound-
note and asked whether I could tell him the place
where they sold “gold teeth like so-and-so has,’’ 1
had sorrowfully to admit that I was behind the
times. There’s a good market waiting for some
Brummagem firm,
* * * *
“Billy Brolga”: There’s a lot in what
“Cartot’’ says (B. 31/5/’23) about how misleading
the “rings” visible to the unaided eye are in the
matter of telling a tree’s age. As an experienced
timber-getter, I can testify that the visible rings
shown by many trees upon being sawn through would
fall far short of the age, counting each ring as a
year. This applies to a sawn surface, and not to a
planed one; in the latter case rings otherwise
invisible would probably show up. The usual dia-
metrical growth of an average healthy tree (hard-
wood) in normal seasons is about one inch a year;
but in dry times the expansion might not amount to
one quarter-inch. Although scorching by bushfires checks
the growth of timber, I don’t think it would inter-
fere, as “Cartot” suggests, with the ring-marking,
which would appear on the side to which growth was
deflected.
* *- * *
“Ringer”: Will one of the Abo. vets, tell
me if Birdsville, Chillagoe and Kimberley diseases
are identical, and, if not, what are the differences?
I have had good reason to know the first-named it
cleaned up 37 of my yarramans in two days.

JEANNIE’S SMILE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When clouds are low and days are dark
As though the world’s repining,
The sunshine of our Jeannie’s smile
Brings us a silver lining.
Oh, smooth and rounded is her cheek,
Her dimpled chin beguiling ;
Though irksome is her daily task,
Our Jeannie’s always smiling.
Each day she trudges to the town —
A class at school she’s teaching,
Where tangled skeins of crimson tape
Put peace beyond her reaching;
Tliough books be smudged and sums be wrong
And other errors piling,
The droning voices fade at last,
And Jeannie comes out smiling.
Then straightway down the winding track
Where stunted gums are growing,
She bows her head to face the storm,
While bitter winds are blowing;
Through filth and mud she reaches home,
Her dainty shoes defiling ;
Then shaking water from her curls
Our Jeannie comes in smiling.
Or through the long, hot summer days,
In class-rooms hot and steaming,
The sun beats on the window pane
Like some great furnace gleaming;
A coat of dust is over all, '
The ink is nearly “biling,”
The children doze and yawn and gape,
But Jeannie keeps on smiling-.
Though colors run or clash or fade
In garments she is making,
Or silken patterns fail to match
And tangled threads are breaking;
THE BURDEN OF REMEMBRANCE.
ST. P ETER: ‘‘Your credentials are all in
order. But one question. Now, tell me
—HOW DID YOU COME BY THAT UM-
BRELLA?”
Or when the final needle fails
In some smart gown she's styling,
Her lamp she’ll light and say good-night—
Our Jeannie goes off smiling.
Sometimes a bashful youth will call
To bring a book to mother,
Or gather sound advice from me
On some bush lore or other ;
He squirms and blushes to his hair
(The mop he’s been well “iling”),
Or twiddles with his watch and,chain,
If Jeannie comes in smiling.

is the first thought which enters the mind at sight of
the ESSEX. The smart, attractive and uncommon
design certainly deserves great admiration, but the
name of ESSEX has become famous for reasons
greater than the car’s appearance. Not only motorists
who are familiar with doings in the motor world
respect the ESSEX, but the vast multitude of the
general public cannot, and do not, fail to be impressed
by the super-efficiency of the ESSEX, thrust upon
them repeatedly by the press reports of the car’s
successes in all manner of contests and performances.

“Akran” : This fluke-shot discussion re-
minds me. My aunt and uncle had charge of a
station here on the North Coast (N.S.W.), and the
rats were so bad at the homestead when I was staying
with them that traps were set all over the house.
One night my aunt was awakened by something fall-
ing on her face. Thinking it was uncle’s arm she
threw it aside. The next instant one of the rat-traps
went off, and on striking a match to investigate, my
aunt found a tiger-snake about sft. long securely
gripped in the trap. She had lifted it off her face
and thrown it to its death.

21/6/’23), which could be caught only by rushing up
to it, reminds me of a fine mare that my dad once
bought from a bad-tempered teamster. When we
first got her the only way we could catch her was
by racing at her, roaring and waving a waddy, when
she would trot up and hold out her head for the
winkers. Another horse we had could be caught
outside of a yard only by going up to him with the
bridle held out at arms’ length with both hands,
newchum fashion. I know of another case in which
WORKS WITHOUT FAITH; OR THE HEALING
OF THE UNBELIEVER.
to catch the prad you had to grab it by the bottom
lip, and two instances in which it was necessary to
take hold of the neddies by the tails.

“Monaro”: Re odd discoveries in trees
(“J.K.R.5.,” B. 26/7/’23). At Grenfell (N.S.W.) a
circular-saw was tearing through a log, when with
a screech it shed every tooth. Investigation showed
a tomahawk head that had been embedded years before
and grown completely over. On the N.S.W. South
Coast in the heart of a redgum a woodcutter found
a bees’ nest, yards of honey and dead bees, without
exit whatever. Though there was no sign of it, there
must have once been an opening which had slowly
been grown over. Incidentally, old survey-marks on
trees frequently have to be “chopped for.”
AND NOBODY EVER SAW ANY THAT DID MORE.
“Don’t like that dog of yours.”
“ Wot's wrong with him?”
“His legs is too short.”
“Well, they reach the blanky ground , don’t they?”
“Old Timor”: Re lady grafters (B.
19/7/’23).' About 16 years ago, a girl at Bexley,
near Sydney, used to drive 16 miles to Saltpan
Creek, cut a drayload of wood, and next day deliver
it in Marrickville. She did this six days a week
for years. Also, when the sons of two families
living in a valley 14 miles from Mittagong all left
the farms (the fathers were working on the rail-
way six miles off), the mothers and daughters split
posts and rails, fenced, grubbed the trees, cultivated
the land, ploughed and harrowed, ringbarked, cut
down the small timber, burned off, did the hay-
making, milked, killed, and cured bacon. They
also built a store-room of slabs with an iron roof,
which is still strong and sound after weathering 35
years. As for riding, I saw one of the girls on a
horse which had leading harness on. Something
started him bucking, and when it stopped all that
was left on him was the collar and the girl.
“Wander”: For the Kangaroo-shooting
Stakes let me nominate one Thompson, a Too-shooter
on Lilydale, in the north-east of S. Aus., who has
just completed the job of skinning 22,000 hoppers
in three years. In addition he has managed to
secure 1500 foxes in his spare time. Six days con-
stitute his working week.
* * * #
“Jarrah”: “Police Patrol’s” Snowy Rive-
girls (B. 12/7/’23), who shear, hunt, kill and skin,
remind me that on the Warren River (south-west
W.A.) there is a family of ’em that can do the
same. The father having gone oyer the range,
three girls carry on the farm with the help) of a
younger brother. Each year they drive their cattle
through the bush to the coast, which necessitates
camping out. In 1917, when a record flood cut off
some sheep and no man could be found to face
the job, one of the
girls forced her horse
into the swirling
waters, and, though
washed down a consid-
erable distance, reached
the other side. After
getting the sheep into
a dingo-proof paddock,
she took the return
plunge. When the ’pos-
sum season opened in
’2O two of the girls
took pack-horses 10
miles through dense
jarrah forest and
camped in an old hut
for a fortnight, living
on ’possum and damper,
seeing no one, but
snaring enough ’pos-
sums to enable them
to buy anew buggy
and new cows, and
place a substantial
amount in the bank.
One of them has been
known to pull the overcoat from a ’possum in 45
seconds.
* * * *
“M.S.” : I think the old chap gave
“Ringer” (B. 7/6/’23) the dinkum oil when he said
the three-year-old mother was only 19 months older
than her colt. When my grandfather died he left
my mother a mare with a fortnight-old filly foal.
The mare and foal were put in the paddock with
father’s horses a fortnight after Grandad’s death;
that made the foal a month old. Avery small pony
entire was running with them, and exactly 18 months
after being in the paddock the filly foaled. All the
horses mentioned except the old mare are still alive
and doing well; and it’s nigh 20 years since it hap-
pened.
“Carisbrook; Jun.”: Tell “Parama” (B.
28/6/’23) that the best baits for crocodiles are the
entrails of a bullock or buffalo —not dogs, pigs or
native kids, as he suggests. I’ve seen dozens caught
by Frank Povah at Wyndham (W.A.), and all he
uses is the refuse from the meatworks there. I’ll
back Povah against any man in Australia at catch-
ing crocs. 1 have seen him land a 20-footer with
omy five other men to assist him. I was one of
them—and I don’t mind admitting that I. had the
wind up all through the circus.
“Keystring” : Has the vegetation of a par-
ticular district anything to do with producing
albinos? While ’roo-shooting on Yulgilbar, the cattle
station on the Upper Clarence (N.S.W.) that boasts
a real castle, the following came under my notice:
A pure-white native-bear, a cream-colored ’possum
with pink eyes, and a white jackass. The last was
an old hand on Broadwater (an out-station), and was
pointed out to me. Frankly, this fellow’s suit didn’t
do his laundry much credit, but was all one color.
Incidentally, he seemed respectably married to a
commoner. Another item of interest I saw on the
same run was a beautiful parrot, apparently the
rosella-lory cross recently described in the Abo.
column.
* * *. +
“Pat Bushie”: “Billy Brolga” notwith-
standing (B. 19/7/’23), the dingo does get nasty at
the presence of a man, and will attack savagely,
even when not interfered with. I was once riding
on the carry-all of a motor-bike, out from Esk (Q.),
when a dingo gave chase, following for several miles,
running close to the machine and snapping at our
legs. Only when almost into town did the warrigal
turn into the bush.
“Amboina”: In 1921 I took a geological
survey party 50-odd miles inland from the n.-w. coast
of ex-German New Guinea, in search of oil. About
30 miles in the roll-call showed a boy short, and a
native-police patrol was sent to find the missing one.
They found him a few miles back, making his way
campwards, speechless and suffering intense pain. It
turned out that he had been captured by a bush tribe
and tortured —two bushmen had held him while
another powerful member of the tribe grasped ins
head and turned it round until his eyes were where
the back or the head should be. This was done three
times and he was then released and started on his
way. His tonsils swelled so much that he was unable
to speak, and in three days he was dead, after suffer-
ing the most excruciating agony. I ascertained that
the practice is common in this district, together with
other and less printable forms of torture.
* * * *
“Larry Longun”: I say “hear hear” to
“Pedro’s” praises of the kurrajong (B. 31/5/’23).
Hunting for the luscious roots of young kurries and
young bottle-trees was a favorite pastime of mine
when a boy. We learnt the trick from j'oung
Binghis, and before long were as expert as they in
locating the tiny trees, the bulbous, carrot-like tap-
root of which is eaten. The bottle-tree is the tastier,
but both require to be very young—a, slender stem
of five or six inches bearing! a coupile of leaves —-
otherwise the root is tough and fibrous and of poor
flavor. Cattle are very partial to both the foliage
and wood of the bottle, and as a boy I chopped many
a bagful of chips for old Tinker’s tea.
“Steve Hart”: I have used some queer
recipes for making the pint of “dust” rise when
jazzing with Matilda around the bush. Gidgee ashes
give the flour a slight rise. A pint full of hot
charcoal dropped in the mixing water is also good.
Mixing some flour and water and standing by the
fire till it ferments requires too much time. Fruit
salts is very good. But, apart from the real dyna-
mite (baking powder), carbonate of soda is the
cheapest und best. Three-pennyworth will last weeks,
am i you squeeze the juice of a lemon or orange
in the mixing water, it surpasses baking-powder.
“Trevdee”: Tell “L’Fou” (B. 12/7/’23)
we also had a dog that knew when it was Sunday.
She was a greyhound, and when being trained for a
coursing match she would, on week days, get out of
bunk regularly at about 6.30 a.m., trot over to her
trainer s sleep-out, and wake him up with a couple
of yelps. By 7 a.m. she'd be galloping behind his
push-bike on a five-mile run. On Sundays the sprint
used to be postponed till 11 a.m.—and the dog
f.ould never budge from bunk till the boss called her.
* * *
W essel”: As far as we know, the first
Europeans to see a corroboree were the Dutch crew
of the Rijder, a vessel which visited the west coast
of Cape York Peninsula in 1756. Near Duyfken
Point, 19 natives, “having their bodies .all besmeared
with led, held a frolic, with a kind of song.” The
Rijder s crew were also probably the first white men
to see a dingo. They took .away with them two
abos., who were no doubt the first Australian ratives
to voyage overseas. Torres took a score of natives
with him, but these were Torres Strait Islanders
or Papuans.
* * * *
“Nosredneh”: “Valamac” (B. 5/7/’23)
is mistaken about kookaburras trying to drink out of
windmill tanks. I had a jackie for 10 years, and in
all that time I never once saw him drink. I had a
kerosene-tin cut in halves lengthways and filled with
water, and every day without fail Jack would stand
on one end and plunge through to the other. He
never stood in the bath and fluttered like other birds,
but simply plunged from end to end. If he ever
drank it was when diving through his bath. “Vala-
mac’s” jackies were trying to bathe, not drink, ami
the tank being deep, they couldn't get out.
“King Kwrrajong”: Alec Russell, now
shearing at Wanganella, near Deniliquin (N.S.W.),
must be about the ringer among the blade-barbers.
His tallies are always high, but one of his greatest
exploits was put up at Eyuck, out from Ballarat,
where he averaged 200 a day for five weeks. Another
time at Rochester Park he clipped 207 in seven hours.
* * * *
“Nymboida” does a little barking:—
The kurrajong hats mentioned by “Condamine”
(B. 7/'6/’23) are easily eclipsed by those made from
the sycamore, which grows in all the softwood
brushes of the Clarence (N.S.W.). The blacks living
on Nymboida station used’ the bark years ago for
making fishing-nets, food-baskets and diltybags, it
being quite as tough and strong as kurrajong, and
certainly more beautiful for hat making. Such
headgear commands a high figure in some of the
high-class millinery establishments in Sydney. The
blacks used to make their helimans from sycamore
wood, which is exceptionally light and intensely tough
when dry. So soft is the green timber that a vigorous
LESS COMPETITION.
THE BOSS: “It beats me how such a blinded
fool as you has managed to keep alive to
your age.”
THE POM: “ Aye, lad; Oi ’ad ’ard times
among they smart folkses at ’ ome; but
I expect to do right fine out ’ere.”
man can drive the axe in up to the eye in one
chop. The bark is stripped about February or
March, after heavy rain, when it is easily peeled off
by an axe expert. It is at once soaked in clean
water (a running stream for preference) for about
10 days, to bleach it and dissolve the glutinous sub-
stance between the layers, thus enabling each layer
to be easily separated from its the one
nearest the sap being the most superior. Strange to
say, though each layer is a network of holes, water
does not pass through, as I have demonstrated to
Doubting Thomases many times. A stockman wear-
ing a sycamore hat was caught in a raging storm,
but returned home with a perfectly dry head, some
of the schools on the Clarence use this bark tor
manual work, and produce pretty dolls’ bats, mats,
trays and baskets. To heighten the effect they
also use dye, and work in patterns of various colors.
The sycamore is a magnificent shade tree (deciduousj
and grows to the height of about 100 ft., with a cir-
cumference up to 3ft. or more. If put on the market
by an enterprising firm, the bark fibre would
probably be used extensively, but, being an Aus-
tralian product, it receives scant notice, rossibiv
when electric power is available in Grafton it will
boom, as large quantities are still to be had in tne
brushes not yet touched by the axe of the cowoiogist.
AT DEEWHY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At Deewliy in the days of bloom
When Spring puts on her best.
If you would free your mind of gloom
And count your moments blest,
While breezes blow and ripples flow
On hill and blue lagoon,
A-roving go with footsteps slow
Some sunny day at noon.
Xot caring how the sands may run
In Time’s uplifted glass,
You’ll watch the patterns that the sun
Throws down on fern and grass,
And hear afar on beach and bar
The sea’s soul-soothing sound,
While, fair to see, and courteously,
The Spring shall show you round.
With warning eyes and upraised hand
Stock-still in some retreat,
By leaves and branches arched and spanned,
She’ll bid you stay your feet,
While grey of wing gay thrushes fling
Abroad their melodies
With joy athrill, as though to fill
Your moments with heart’s ease.
She’ll show you all that she has done
With rain and shine and dew-
lied bush-flowers blushing in the sun,
And gold of wattle too,
And bracken green, whereon a sheen
Surpassing silver lies,
And mosses cool beside a pool
That mirroi-s cloudless skies.
With her you’ll see oak-groves, green-tressed,
And sapling tops of bronze,
And on the landlocked water’s breast
A flock of stately swans
That, called by her, to-night shall stir,
Lift wings and ’neath the moon
With soundful flight, trail through the night,
To some far-off lagoon.
Like pearls of music, pure and soft,
To you shall come the notes
Of peewits in tall gums aloft;
And where the brown bee dotes
On pink boronia you shall stroll.
While Spring makes green the earth,
And brings your shadowed, sombre soul
To beautiful re-birth.
x.s.w.

The poor old Southern Cross looked like
a few guttering candles last week when
3000-odd stars of the flicker world scintillated
about Moore Park on their way to the Movie
Ball in the Palais Royal. It was a night out
for everybody interested in the film business;
all the ’eads were present, including Harry
Musgrove disguised as a Pirate King, or
was it Mercia in “The Sign of the Cross”?
The flutter was to help the funds of the
Sunshine Club, so Nurse Hughes and May
Matthews were among the early arrivals,
bjeaming to see the stars weave months of
sunshine for the back-street kiddies who are
the chief beneficiaries of the club. Dame
Margaret, supported by Miss Henderson and
Aide Blandy, took the salute from a flutter
of pretty debs., for whom Mrs. Trefle and
Mrs. Fallon were bobmothers. The Palais
is always an attractive dancing spot, and
the remarkably well-carried-out sets and the
original individual costumes made a scene at
once bizarre and glittering. Mary Pickford
gave her priceless curls a night out; and the
Gish sisters were quite happy as “Orpnans
of the Storm.” Of course, the one and only
Charlie took a turn; and so did Rudolph
Valentino. Everybody whose eyelashes you
Ijave ever seen quiver in a close-up Chicagoed,
foxed or soft pedalled about the big floor, and
during the evening prizes to the value ot
dver £lOO were distributed. Of this a wad
went to the “Blood and Sand” set that
brought its live stock in the form of a bull;
and the second prize went to a dashing,
swashbuckling Robin Hood, his Merry Men
and Maid Marian. And you should have seen
the Littlejohn of the Lincoln Green clan. He
measured about seven feet in his socks, as
the crow flies.
Lee White’s matinee for St. Margaret’s
was the huge success it deserved to be. The
house was packed from floor to ceiling; pro-
grammes at Is. sold as readily as highbahls
on a dry liner. The lady herself and husband
Clay sent a high-voltage current of enthusi-
asm through the house. Sweets and home-
made cakes raked in any loose cash that
(night still lurk in the corner of a woman’s
purse. There were at least two men in every
Cow of chairs (that’s a Matinee Miracle) ;
and the hospital’s secretary, May Sheehan,
Sported a Napoleonic line of millinery, and
Arranged a sale of Lee White photographs
with a firmness that the Man of Destiny
himself might have envied. And the artists
who made up the programme (God bless
them !..). were as generous as they always are.
c, sphere’s a Rose Ball every year to help
Sfi Margaret’s Hospital, and last week’s
reached the high-water mark of success. The
1 Addington Town Hall was a bower, with
the übiquitous balloon in hundreds strung
athwart the rafters. The Sheldon dame,
wfio was Queen of the May, so to speak,
dressed her presidential job in jetted frock-
ing, and was supported by the two girls
and sister-in-law Mrs. T. J. Dalton, that
fair-haired lady mixing black satin and
ermine with telling effect. Treasurer Mrs.
Muller trailed pale mauve, and swathed her
locks in a wide flower bandeau ; Mrs. Lever-
rier wore rich lavender brocades; Bronzie
Clonan, who flew a cerise seal or tw r o on her
black frocking, won the jazz competition in
company with Jack Lyons; and Mollie
Kelly, of Ryde, was, as in many past years,
the model secretary.
The 44th show of the Royal Art Society
whs opened by Minister of Education Brunt-
nell in dulcet tones on Saturday afternoon,
and the long gallery of the Education De-
partment was crowded for the event. Art sts
and their friends came in legion, smiling
over the crop of red seals already sprouting
on the frames. Alfred Coffey’s glowing land-
scape drew a big crowd, and at 125 guineas
was among the first sales. John Longstaff’s
rather contemplative “Carmen” (a study
of K.C. Broomfield’s wife) showed up well
against a flame-yellow background. Artist
Mary Edwards came and viewed her own
canvas from afar. Theo Cowan and Mrs.
Rix Nicholas were interested visitors; Syd
Smith dropped the Society of Artists for an
hour to cast an eye over the rival show, and
brought Ernest Watt for company. Lister
Lister, president of the Royals, tried not to
look self-conscious when people glanced from
the Balfour portrait to himself. Olive
Birkenhead was there in the flesh and on
canvas: her Sunlit Vale is a characteristic
bit of work. And Percy Eagles and Pixie
Harris were two more of the younger set
represented.
It was in Farmer’s Lounge that the
National Council of Women carved the roast
bullock in honor of Mrs. Henry Dobson, of
Tasmania; Dr. Rosalie Morton, of the
U.S.A.; and Miss Dingman, of the Y.W.C.A.
The vice-regal wing flapped approvingly over
the gathering; Dame Margaret, under a
spreading black hat, sat buttressed between
the Queen Victoria millinery of Mrs. Dobson
and the neatly smart, almost perky, headgear
of Miss Dingman. Altogether, the psycho-
logy of clothes could not have been better
exemplified. Dame Margaret’s breathed dig-
nity and the assurance of a place on life -
box-seat; the brilliant, soft-voiced National
Council president’s suggested that her sar-
torial sense had been arrested by the surging
traffic of the grey matter below the bonnet;
while Miss Dingman’s combined utility, con-
fidence in Providence and concession to the
prevailing fashion. Next to Miss Dingman
sat the American doctor, in mourning for
President Harding. But, being an Ameri-
can, even her sable draperies were cut witn
consciousness of belonging to the sex that
claimed Helen of the Greeks; so a fine throat
and a pair of well-turned arms were worn
bare, and the black headgear at the most
becoming angle.
Next Sunday Dame Adelaide Anderson
will arrive in Sydney, and on Tuesday even-
ing she will be entertained by the Women
graduates of Sydney Uni. at the Women’s
Club. The Dame’s arrival is, among other
things, expected to tone up an appeal which
is being made for funds to purchase Crosby
Hall—the British Federation of University
Women wants it as a sort of Club for Uni.
Women, particularly from overseas.
Dame Adelaide is one of the world’s ex-
perts on industrial questions. She was Chief
Woman Inspector of Factories in England
from 1597-1921; and of course she has pub-
lished a book —“Women in the Factory.”
From here she goes to China to advise the
Pekin Government on intended legislation for
Women and Children.
Tenor Walter Kirby introduced a new idea
into Sydney’s singing world last week by an
afternoon lecture on voice production. Walter
is in the rare position of having the organ
and the technique to illustrate perfectly his
maxims, and his words should have been as
pearls above price to the voice-student. After
the talk the tenor voice, a sort of mixture of
honey and flame, was poured out in old Eng-
lish airs and Italian operatic numbers; in
one aria the singer demonstrated what he
had named the velvet line of Caruso’s middle
register. Kirby, who lived for six years in
Italy, speaks the tongue with the true spa-
ghetti nuances, and listening to him brought
to memory the story of the Sydney lady who
complained that she didn’t know what pro-
vince Rella, of the Sistine Choir, came from.
She couldn’t follow his speech at all, and
she had been studying Italian for six months
with a perfectly splendid Russian teacher!
Here is the latest Falk photograph of artist
Hilda Rix-Nicholas. The good-looking young
woman is one
of Australia’s
strongest
women - paint-
ers ; and she
has just
proved it over
again by her
show of can-
A’ases of the
Monaro coun-
try at An-
thony Ho r-

Ethel Stephens, president of the Society
of Women Painters, and Jane Brenan are
running a joint show of paintings and Doul-
ton at the New Art Salon. The paintings
are mostly of French and Belgian origin, ex-
cepting the still lifes (melons, apricots and
cherries; grapes, plums and nuts) —they
might appear on any vegetarian bill of fare
wherever Esperanto is spoken. There are
two nudes. But, hush ! Remember Norman
Lindsay! The show lasts till the 25th.
His Ex. and Dame Margaret go to Coota-
mundra on September 11 to give their bless-
ing to the annual show, to a soldiers’ memo-
rial and to a new wing at the High School.
Ten days later they are off to Bathurst,
thence to Parkes, Forbes and Condobolin;
in each place they will do a little stone-
masonry for Bishop Long, who accompanies
them.
The Australian friends of Colonel Leslie
Wilson were not surprised at his appoint-
ment as Governor of Bombay, for his posi-
tion as Conservative Whip in the House of
Commons is generally a stepping-stone to a
good job. He could have had a State Gov-
ernorship in Australia without the asking,
but, though he hopes some day to visit here,
he doesn’t want to come officially. When
Leslie Wilson was A.D.C. to Sir Harry
Rawson, his good looks, sunny disposition
and eloquent speech made him a hot favo-
rite. He acquired a wife in Sydney, a
daughter of that Captain Smith who, in the
early days, made a pot of money trading
in the Islands.
Florence Newton is retiring after many
years’ service in the Education Department,
16 of them as headmistress of the Girls'
Superior School, Mosman. The Parents an
Citizens’ Association of the red-roofed suburb
is going to say things to her about it at a
social evening on September 12. Miss New-
ton .is a Mudgee native, and a brother is
chief of the high-scliool section of Cleveland-
street.
The Conservatorium has acquired as a
gift from R. J. D. Seller, of Manly, a Broad-
wood concert grand, one of the two used by
Sir Charles Halle on his Australian tour.
Some months ago the same donor presented
to the Con. the fine music library of his late
brother, W. P. Seller.
A wave of sympathy goes out to A.J.C.
secretary Cropper and to Surgeon Mac-
Cormick’s lady, whose mother, Mrs. Cropper,
died at the week-end. Mrs. Cropper, who
belonged to one of the old pioneering families
in the Lake George district, had reached the
fulness of 80 years when the end came at
her daughter’s home, Kilmeny, Point Piper.
Say “How do y’do?” to Mrs. J. T. Lang,
wife of the new Leader of the Opposition.
While her hus-
band, a former
Treasurer, is
keeping his
eye on the
Government,
the lady is
keeping hers
on Spring
bulbs and
seedlings ; she
has made a
beautiful little
garden about
her home at
Auburn. The
local charities,
p a r ticularly
the hospitals,
have an active
friend in Mrs.
Lang, who
proves her
o r ganising
capacity oa ,
many committees. The eldest daughter in-
herits father’s clear head and solid ability.
She is a J.P. and a student of economics;
and she manages dad’s agency business at
Auburn while father tackles bigger problems
in Macquarie-street. Mrs. Lang’s photo is
from the May Moore Studios.
Mrs. Sara Lydia Brown, who died last
week at Gordon, was the widow of mission-
ary George Brown, whose work in the Pacific
she shared for many years. It was in her
blood, for she was a daughter of the late par-
son J. Wallis, of Maoriland, who spent 40
years keeping an eye on Henare’s soul.
Three daughters, two sons and a number of
grand-children are among those mourning her.
To welcome the Japanese peers and scien-
tists, Shipping knight Owen Cox spread rich
meats—so rich that they positively glittered
—at the Australia one night last week. Ten
of the local peerage, the Japanese Consul
and the leaders of the Chrysanthemum com-
munity were among the guests, and the table
where' the Heads and the visitors sat was
laid out as a Japanese landscape. Very much
the sort of landscape the willow pattern has
educated us up to—all temples and little
bridges and trickling streams. But it was
very pretty and soothing when the ear had
grown tired of. the records of the human
voice spun off by politician and city knight.
Sweet-pea and Iceland poppies kept the
judges busy at Farmer’s Spring Flower Show
on the first days of this week; and the
banked glories chanted of Spring from tail-
handled basket, slim vase and squat bowl,
and literally thousands of men and women
from the North side and “the Line” came to
view the garden beauties. All-Flowers and
Carnation days follow.
Annette Kellerman was the belle of the
ball given by the swimming women of Syd-
ney the other night in Sargent’s. The Durack
sisters, the two Lovelace girls and Alma
Brophy undulated in glittering, eye-arresting
styles till the arrival of the tank lady, who
wiped everybody’s eye with a dazzling frock
whose skirt was woven of cherry and white
beads. Over this magnificence she wrapped
a velvet cloak with the same fancy-warming
hue, and put the final kick in the cocktail
dressing by flying a souffle of silver and
cherry tissue on her hair.
The Queen Victoria Club got in early
with its party to Phyllis Hazel who sings
her farewell to Sydney in the Town Hah
on the 29th. Phyllis goes to the ends of the
earth in search of whatever polish they can
put on her beautiful contralto notes. She
Was educated at the Mercy Convent Parra-
matta, and first attracted notice while sing-
ing at a school concert where singer Charles
Smythe heard her; and, later, Clara Butt
handed the young singer more than one ver-
bal bouquet.
Canon Bellingham, at St. Philip’s, slipped
the matrimonial fetters on fair-haired Amy
Vera Booth, of Stanmore, and her deep-sea
hero, Captain C. B. Filrner, who owns a
D.S.C. for war service in the Imperial Navy.
It happened on Wednesday evening of last
week. Silver-brocaded tissue on ivory satm
formed the bride’s frocking; a long Court
train, a mist of tulle veiling and a sheaf of
hyacinths completed the picture. Two brides-
maids, in shell-pink and silver brocade, their
shell-pink poke bonnets having a lattice-
work of silver over their crowns, and flying
pink streamers, followed the bride; and there
was one tiny trainbearer in silk and silver
lace. The festive foods were drunk at the
Carlton, at the instigation of the bride’s
father and mother. Captain Filrner is now
Acting-Marine Superintendent for the Adel-
aide Steamship Co.
Among old Bathurst families are the
Busbys and the Meaghers ; the former arrived
there in the early ’thirties, and the latter in
the roaring ’fifties. The clans became allied
matrimonially on August 7, when Phillis
Jean Busby said “I will” to Anthony John
Meagher, son of “Mick” and grandson of
John, M.L.C., in the cathedral of St.
Michael and St. John, where the Meaghers
have worshipped for 70 years.
Mrs. Septimus Levy is jubilant over the
engagement of her son Dougias, in London, to
a beautiful girl said to belong to one of the
bluest of Spain’s old families. The wedding
occurs in London next month. The other
son, Pat, and his bride have returned from
their jazzymoon, and are nesting temporarily
in Elizabeth Bay while their home is being
built.
A Brisbane postscript:—
The Show drew 75,000 for its Big Day, whereat
a cheery grin bisected the chubby face of Secretary
Bain. At the official dinner both the Federal and
State Exes, were among the talkers. Sir Matthew
spent most of the day in the ring with his best eye
on the draught horses; but a few of the vice-regal
party went off to the Ascot races, Mrs. Pitt Rivers
among them. A broken collar-bone put Miss Butcher
out of action in the jumping events on the second
day.
The ball at Government House was the biggest
thing in a week of many large-sized social stunts.
Sir Matthew with Capt. Hammond and Michael
Rogers received the hundreds who rolled up, and the
G.-G. and Lady Forster, Mrs. Pitt Rivers and Lady
Patricia Blackwood (whose handsome fur coat had
been stolen from her motor in front of the G.P.O.
during the day) added an extra layer of brilliancy
to the social veneer.
The Girls’ Ball was another charming function,
smelling very sweet with Toowoomba violets and
narcissi; and the Matrons’ Ball filled the Trocadero
on the 9th while parked, cars obliterated, most of the
side streets in the vicinity.
On the same evening Nudgee College broke out in
dance in the South Brisbane City Hall. Sir Matt
went along with Mrs. Pitt Rivers and Capt. Harry
Hammond.
The R.Q. Golf Club-house was done up in peach
blossom, pink sweet-peas and palm fronds the same
night. The G.-G. and Sir Matthew were there, with
Lady Forster in powder blue and silver. Also Gen-
eral Ryrie and his spouse, she in black jetted tulle
with blue and gold lace.
The Fleet Ball (which took place before the
arrival of the whole fleet) was really the first of the
Show balls, and set itself in the South Brisbane hall.
All the Excellencies were present, with Mrs. Pitt
Rivers, Capts, Mulholland and Hammond and Lieut.
Seymore. Lady Forster was in black georgette, and
jade and silver adorned the graceful Pamela. Helene
Mellish and Elma Shattock were debs., the first in
ivory and the other in maize.
Lavender and white stocks were passed to Lady
Forster, amid decorations of roses, by the members at
a Women’s Club function the other day. Lady Patricia
Blackwood also acquired floral handfuls. N.-ll Douglas
Graham recited, Audrey Iliff performed also, and
Lady Forster made a speech commending the club
for its activities.
Among the presentations to Ethel Campbell in
Brisbane was one at the hands of the R.S.S.I.L. of a
set of verses of welcome by Mrs.’ Forrest, bound in
maroon leather and emblazoned with an enamelled
soldier’s badge and a felicitous dedication. On the
platform at the crowded “rally” in the Exhibition
concert-hall were the Cowleys, Brigadier-Gen. Spencer
Browne, Major Maddock, Dr. and Mrs. Campbell and
Mrs. M. Forrest. President Christie was in the
chair, and Harry Borradale declaimed the verses,
after which the “Angel” led the poetess to the foot-
lights to share the Diggers’ cheers.
The Fathers’ Association rolled up with a volume
of views of transports leaving Australia and a life-
membership badge presented by Charles Gibbon —
whereat Ethel said she was somewhat surprised and
wholly delighted to find herself suddenly made a
Father. Red, white and blue bouquets were handed
to the cheery little visitor, and Mayor Diddams
smiled on her right hand. An autograph-album was
also collected from the R.5.5.1.L., and five S.
African veterans arrived late in the evening with
more vegetable tributes.
The Forster Excellencies and Lady Patricia: —with-
out her fur coat —have returned to the south. Capt.
Pitt Rivers, his wife and babies stay on with Sir
Matt at the Government House for some weeks
longer. Margaret Prior is also there.

The Stradbrokes will be back for the Cup.
His Ex.’s attitude lias been absolutely “cor-
rect” in the Cold Land. He has used Ins
opportunities to give us a lift when he
could, but has not attempted to pose as an
envoy, as some of his mischief-making satel-
lites said he would. The fact is, he and her
Ex. made the voyage to look after their
family affairs. Lieut.-Gov. Irvine is draw-
ing half the vice-regal appropriation, and
it is understood that Lord Stradbroke will
transfer the other half back to the Treasury.
A stray sunbeam peck-a-booing with the
chill grey clouds helped to overflow the Caul-
field stands for V.A.T.C. Steeplechase Day.
In the jaundiced wintry light the dinginess
of the dressing absolutely dulled the eye. _ A
scattering of reds and yellows jazzing
through the heavy sea of brown and snuff-
colored chiffonery suggested a late autumn
fall. Several misapplied touches of ancient
Egypt produced a few chortles. O Tut, what
things are done in thy name! One lengthy
lady looked as if she was making for her
bath in a highly-colored and flowery kimono,
but saved the situation with a black hat that
had yellow roses perching rakishly on the
brim. A mid-Victorian dress triumph (pre-
sumably salvaged from an ancient chest),
showing a pinched waist ana overplus of
trimmings, served as an awful warning of
what we may expect if the dress-reformers
get their way. Some of the newest skirts
flapped dismally over their wearers’ low
shoe-heels, and most of the before-worn had
‘been let down another tuck. But a solitary
abbreviation was there to remind us that
feminine legs are not always shapely.
Everard Browne, looking thinner but very
fit after his Colombo trip, brought, his wife,
whose fur-edged brown coat, cape-collared
Orientally, was topped by a wide-brimmed
hat with a crosswise plume. Daughter Gwyn-
neth was also bound in brown, but of a
darker tint. Mrs. Rupert Greene and Clive
Leonard’s fair-haired wife decorated the
stewards’ pen, both browned from head to
ankle. Dr. Eddie Spowers’s youthful wife
brightened her brown with a colored hat-
wing and a captivating smile. The spouse
of veteran sport Sep Miller managed to
sparkle in sombre dressings. The Jack
Molesworth pair—she a joyous note in blue
—attracted some attention as they stepped
superiorly from a smart equipage drawn by
a spanking pair of bays. Mrs. Fenner was
with daughter Ida, who is looking back upon
the woes of a badly-smashed ankle Ihe
Reggie Clarke widow, in an inky frock, was
with her pal Nora Power, who had guardeu
against the chill with a fur-trimmed coat
under a blue lid. Mrs. Hildyard had toned
her tweed tailor-made with vivid yellow stock-
ings and hat, and Mrs. Barry Thompson,
furred to the eyebrows, smiled as one who
had backed a winner. Mrs. Stanley Ham-
mond was tailored in grey under a black
velvet hat, and Norman Wilson s cheery
little other half, who seldom misses any
horsey event worth mentioning, wore all
black. „
Western Districted overflowed Toorak St.
John’s to hear a Portland belle, Elsa Slee-
man, exchange I wills with Tom, the young-
est hope of the T. H. LaidlaWs, of Hamilton.
Elsa handed over by her medical tathei,
looked like the bride of one’s dreams, with a
mist of tulle veiling her silver-brocaded and
crystalled slimness, orange-blossoms on her
fair head and a sheaf of lilies in the crook ot
one arm. Sisters Girlie and Daisy Sleeman
’maided in shimmery green silk scooped out
at the hems, and flew silvery tulle veils from
their flower-encircled thatches. Jim Affleck
and A. McFarlane, of S’Australia, helped the
bridegroom through his job.. No. 9 Darling-
street saw the subsequent jollo.
The Willie Smith widow, who died the
other day in London, was the Melbourne
matron who, assisted by Dr. Helen Sexton
and Mrs. Robert Blackwood, financed and
looked after one of the first war hospitals in
the French capital. Mrs. Smith, who was
the daughter of Dr. Wilson, an Anglican
cleric in North Ireland, was a much-travelled
person, and could make herself understood m
several tongues. Furthermore, she was one
of the most generous givers Melbourne has
ever known. After parting with her old St.
Kilda home, Ravenswood, she unpacked in
White Lodge, at the South Yarra end ot
Toorak-road ; but after both daughters took
the matrimonial trail (one with an Irish-
man, Major Dease, who once spent some
years among the gum-trees; the other with
a S’Australian Penfold) she converted the
Lodge into two flats. The Everard Brownes
hire the lower set, and the ex-mayoral Hen-
nessys the top lot. Mrs. Smith s Melbourne
brothers, Fred and Tom Wilson, are mourn-
ing her loss. Her son, daughters and step-
son (who married a Warrnambool girl,
Maggie Scott) have all made their homes
overseas.
A new and terrible bushranging idea has
been originated by incumbent Walsh of the
baby parish of Deepdene, which was founded
12 months ago with a population of bU
families and a debt of £11,001). The scheme,
“Deepdene Teas,” was inaugurated at the
Francatelli on Friday. You lure at least
six unsuspecting friends to tea, and after
feeding them extract sixpence and a promise
from each to hold a similar tea within a
certain period. And so it goes. The thing
has spread so that already one tea is billed
for Honolulu and another for Manly.
The thinness of the crowd which assisted
at the official unmuzzling of the European
picture collection in the Athenaeum concert
hall the other night kept one guessing
whether the cold snap or a slump in local Art
enthusiasm was accountable. Baldwin
Spencer, who knows a thing or two about
Art, started the show by offering verbal
posies to those responsible for the invasion
and to Melbourne’s artistic perception ; but
the latter wilted a bit in the sparsely-
peopled atmosphere. Mrs. Arthur Baulieu
fluttered round like a velvety moth, with
a fur-edged coatee warming her silvery
hangings. The Harry Emmerton pair, she
smiling above white fur, were also there. Dr.
Bage, a Gallery Trustee, took an active in-
terest in the show, and Bernard Hall and
Fritz Hart did likewise. Solicitor Willie
Weigall, a cousin of artist Pen. Boyd on t.ie
A’Beckett side, brought his wife and beauty
daughter Elizabeth. Fred McCubbin's
widow, buttressed in blue satin, buzzed round
with much of her former cheerfulness. Mrs.
Jimmy Dyer radiated in fuchsia tints;
Douglas Richardson convoyed his sculptress
wife; Trantham Fryers was sighted in the
gathering; also the Web Gilberts and artist
Mac George. Presumably Hugh Mclntosh’s
interest in the thing had tempted Alec
Isaacson and Tivoli-manager Crawford’s
good-looking wife to come along and see the
show. Coffee and sandwiches spread lavishly
in an off-room cheered the evening. They
were something that everybody could under-
stand.
Cedric Campbell, who grows wool in
N.S.W., and the Guy Miller widow slipped
on their second matrimonial chains last
week at the Collins-street Scots’ kirk with
as little noise as possible. Alfred Levey
handed over his daughter, who looked nice,
as she always does, in grey. Only a handful
of nearest relatives sat in the front pew.
After which the just-weds lunched at Men-
zies’ with the bride’s father, then vanished
’moonwards.
The Taits are mourning the death of their
mother, who died at East Melbourne
last week. She was 86, and for some years
had been almost blind, but she maintained a
sharp interest in the doings of her offspring.
The old lady was a native of London, and
came to Australia in the ’fifties, settling
down at Castlemaine, where all of her child-
ren, barring the youngest, Frank, wers born.
This is Myfidelle (otherwise “Peggy”)
Isaacs, the young Melbourne soprano whose
recent song-recital attracted favorable notice.
She had the
baffling experi-
ence of com-
ing in first
for a ’Varsity
scholarship,
only to be toid
that her
studies were
too far ad-
vanced to ren-
der her eli-
gible as a
scholar-
ship pupil.
Which, apart
from the young
lady’s fi n e
musical intelli-
gence, was a
feather in the
cap of Alice
Rees Vogrich,
who was re-
sponsible for
training the voice. The critics who attended
the recital all commended the singer’s
methods as well as her musical soprano. By
and bye she intends to take the voice over-
sea to see what the experts there have to
say about it.
Prof. A. J. Ewart, botanist at the ’Var-
sity, is taking his first trip back to the Cold
Country after 17 years. When he came to
Melbourne he had about half-a-dozen stu-
dents, and filled in time as Government
Botanist; but his classes swelled, and lie
soon had to give up the Government job.
Ewart is a D.Sc., an F.R.S. and a Doctor
of Philosophy of Leipzig. He has compiled
various learned tomes on the weeds, etc.,
of Australia, but his eye is now lighting
with the prospect of helping on the erection
of a new botany school in the ’Varsity
grounds. It is to cost £20,000, including
£5OOO for apparatus, and Ewart is to scour
Europe for ideas thereanent.
The Maxwell widow, who is off to see
how London is getting on, farewelled her
friends on Friday night with dance music
and song at Nooralim, m Malvern. Xne nost-
ess sparkled in a black-jetted sheath with
something suggestive of ospreys encircling her
head, llita Selby, who is off under Mrs.
Maxwell’s wing, trailed terra-cotta marocain
with blue angel sleeves. The affair lasted
till midnight, and then a few hardened fox-
trotters taxied off to finish up with a whirl
with the Prince’s Club brigade.
Pat Dunlon. who furnished the music for
the liuby INorton prizewinner, “Croajinga-
long,” makes the pardonable excuse that tne
misguided melody was invented to while away
some of the dull hours after a serious oper-
ation. The youth, here depicted by Ruskm,
is at some
pains to ex-
plain that he
has, honest to
goodness, done
better work
and points in
confirmation to
a song given
by Edith Dray-
ton in a past
Wi 11 i a mson
pantomime and
a revue air
that was lively
on the lips of
Minnie Dove.
As a matter
of fact, though
those who hear
“Croaj inga-
long” may find
it hard to be-
lieve, be has
some ability as . .
a musician, and when he was rejected tor
the Front he helped at the Back with a
minstrel co. that poured a good deal of cash
into the Bed Cross funds. But though he
can handle the piano without making the
audience suspect that it is listening to an
unoiled lorry, Moiseiwitsch need not- fear a
rival. The youth’s ambitions are oriented
towards medicine.
Little Margaret Allan, whose widowed
mother looks after the women’s section of
the Argus, undertook to make Alex. McNeil
happy the other day. He is the eldest of the
Malvern McNeil sons, and is preparing to
change his present collar for the sort which
fastens ’hind-to-fore. When the Garran
knight led Margaret up the aisle of St. Paul’s
Cathedral her white satin gleamed under a
lace veil which Mrs. A. Davidson (Sydney)
had lent for the event. This was lightly
anchored by orange-blossoms, while hyacinths
and orchids mingled fragrantly in her
bouquet. Edith McNeil and Patricia Allan,
sisters of the contracting pair, Were in blue
clamped at the side with forget-me-nots and
rosebuds, and mere pink and blue flowers
gladdened their quaint little grey bonnets.
Dudley Roberts stood by the bridegroom.
The wedding tea was spread at the Allans’
Malvern home, Pingunyah.
A sheaf of condolences will cross seas, to
the widow of veteran squatter James Rich-
mond, just dead in Scotland. The deceased,
wnose N.S.W. station, Iladdon Rig, was lately
acquired by the Falkiner brothers, was one
of the fine old pioneer breed now rapidly
dying out —hard-headed, hard-muscled, but
generous to a fault. Nearly a quarter of
a century has gone by since the Richmonds
(she was a Scotch girl and his second
wife) left Toorak to convoy their family
to the cold North. At their picturesque
Perthshire castle their Aussie friends were
always sure of a glad welcome. The big
squatter’s daughter, by his first wife (she
was a N.S.W. Hunter), married a son of
baronet Keith Murray. The youngest Rich-
mond son, Leslie, a captain in a Highland
regiment, was the first British officer to fail
in the war. The eldest son, Jack, who fol-
lowed in his father’s squatting footsteps,
passed out a few years back, and now his
son has started out in Queensland to carry
on the woolgrowing tradition. The only sur-
viving Richmond son, George, sidetracked
a military career to return to Australia, but
climbed back into his Black Watch trappings
for the duration. One son-in-law was killed
in action, and another, Major Gordon Fin-
layson, whose late father managed the Aus-
tralian end of the Union Bark, had a dis-
tinguished record in the big melde.
The other afternoon press-secretary Phil
Finklestein, back in harness after many pain-
ful weeks on the sick-list, beckoned a group
of petticoated Inky-wayfarers for a chat
with Irene Vanbrugh over the Oriental tea-
cups. The thing rather suggested the Hat-
ters’ tea-party, as each lady “moved up one
between courses, so that everyone had an
innings with the star guest. The Vanbrugn
has plenty to say, and a pleasing way of
saying it. She came along in black tailor-
ings with a furred and braided coat which,
when shed, revealed a string-colored jumper
peppered with gold beads. Her black toque
was brightened by a dash of gold over
a streak of green. Ethel Wellesley, who sup-
ported her, was in brown marocain under
a pert little coatee inset with black silk, and

It. W. E. Wilmot, known to all Melbourne
as “Bung” (just because he isn’t and never
was), has left for a health trip to the Solo-
mons, and the Yorick Club farewelled him—
he is going among cannibals! Wilmot is the
Aegus sports writer, “Old Boy”; also, as
hon. sec. of the Melbourne C. of E. Grammar
School Society, he edits an excellent school
paper. In his leisure he is sec. of the Royal
Humane Society, and when not very busy
manages Melbourne’s leading library, the
Athenaeum.
Cyril Dennis (he squats up Gippsland
way) and Elaine Syme dodged the snap-
shotting fiend with an evening wedding at
St. Paul’s Cathedral. The bride was like
unto a rising sun in gold and white brocade,
with a broadcasting of yellow tulle from the
shoulders, under a lace veil clamped to her
head with a double row of orange flowers.
The golden note was heavily accentuated
by a sheaf of daffodils in the crook of one
arm. Sister Kathleen Syme suggested an
African marigold in petal-pointed georgette
and a black tulle hat, sprinkled with yellow
flowers to match her posy. Rupert Moon,
V.C. was in command of the bridegroom.
The ’ Alexandra Club sheltered the after-
gathering when the medical Arthur Symes
cheered the chilly night with a hot supper.
The invited were chiefly Symes and Den-
nises, but some extra-special pals leavened
the family gathering.
This week an eruption of social frivols
was billed to gladden the invading scientists.
The vice-regal Forsters had bagged Monday
afternoon for a shivoo to the Victoria League,
Oat they were to entertain the scientific high-
brows on Tuesday night with a reception at
Government House. The State Parliamen-
tarians will stage their reception on triday
night. The Bob Knoxes’ Toorak parlors
shelter another gathering, and Hugh Ward
will be host at a "Tangerine” performance.
It is to be the scientists’ only theatre visit
in Melbourne.
A dance-and-bridge evening is to happen in
the Anzac House ballroom on the evening of
Sept. 19 to prop up the financial side of the
Blinded Soldiers’ Club. General Chauvel is
presiding over the good work and General
Coxen’s wife will share the hon. sec. job.
President Walter Manifold will not get
back to his Leg. Council chair for some
weeks, as he has just been under an opera-
tion His convalescence will be saddened by
the ’loss of his brother James, who died tne
other day at 82. James, who has lived rather a
hermit’s existence since he was widowed
many years ago, had no children, but a niece
of his wife’s, Dolly Nicholson, grew up in
Uncle’s roomy bungalow at the ITawksburn
end of Toorak. He was a fine, squire-like
figure of a man, and always attracted atten-
tion when taking his daily walks abroad in
knickerbocker suit and cap with a couple 01
terriers yapping at his heels.
Some gossip from Adelaide: —

MICK SIMMONS
SURE CATCH TACKLE
The jumping ability of Les Paddington
earned him the easiest of victories in the big
Steeplechase at Caulfield. The Sydney steed ana
Roisel were the only recent hurdlers in the race.
Roisel, on his record, had perhaps higher pretensions
than Les Paddington to win a four-miles steeple, but
he was not in the fine nick that enabled the hero of
the previous Saturday’s hurdle to rush to the front
a mile from home and leave the field in trouble.
Roisel was the nearest of the pursuers when Les Pad-
dington came to the last jujmp but one, but
the obstacle settled the Melbourne horse’s chance, and
from that time to the finish there was not even the
faintest possibility of the Sydney double being upset.
It was always a one-horse race. Les Paddington
rapped only one rail in the 24 leaps. No expert
’chaser could have done better.
Among the badlv-defeated ones honest Haoma was
steadied by 161 b. in excess of the winner’s respectable
burden (list. 41b.), and Agar, recovering some of
his long-lost form, beat the topweight by a head for
second money. The market had made it more profit-
able to back Agar for a “shop,” s.p., than Les Pad-
dington for a win. Liberate, in finishing fully 10
lengths behind Haoma, proved that newspaper report
of his tiring in his race a week earlier was more
trustworthy than stable confidence in his continued
cherry-ripeness. And Bright Maid, winner last year
and first favorite this time, struck a fence and lost
her rider. Such is steepling. Of four mishaps only
in this contest of 14 jumpers, two were debited to
previous winners—Algous and Bright Maid.
All that was to be learned at Caulfield about aris-
tocratic three-year-olds was that Royal Thought was
more forward than The Monk or Frances Tressady,
and that Sandringham, son of Woorak, could beat
Royal Thought over a mile at an advantage of 321 b.
Another of Woorak’s get, in Polynesian, took advantage
of his minimum weight to win the Balaclava Stakes.
Some of the starters at Caulfield may do better this
Saturday at Flemington, where the V.R.C. opens its
season with a meeting where Spring-handicap hints
are always likely to be dropped in a casual way.
* * * *
Horses with important Spring engage-
ments were in the money at the postponed Rand-
wick meeting on August 9. Danger Zone won the
mile Highweight Handicap, at 10’s, with 221 b. more
than his Epsom impost, 7st. 71b. But after their
experience with Loyal Irish last year backers wall be
chary of rushing any M.L. nag that runs brilliantly
two months before the eventful day. Prads that do
that have an annoying habit of going off. . Old Cool-
stone (16’s) had half her neck in front of ‘Oranian at
the right end of a six-furlong sprint, and Lady Aura
(11 to 2) converted the second division thereof into
a cakewalk. Coolstone is too aged to win an Epsom,
even with Bst. 51b., and speedy and beautiful as
the other mare is, she has never succeeded at a mile.
One would take Oranian to beat the three mentioned
in the Epsom. He ran a capital race in the Don-
caster, and Bst. 61b. shouldn’t bother the powerful
animal.
* * * *
There are strikes, and rumors of strikes, in
the racing world. In Perth (W.A.) recently a meet-
ing arranged for one of the Wren courses had to
he abandoned owing to the morose hostility of
owners and trainers. In Sydney those, who follow
the ponies and the pacers are refusing to nominate
their quadrupeds for A.R.C. and Trotting Club events.
“" one side it is contended that the proprietary
bodies are too grasping; on the other, that there
“ e too many one-horse battlers about. But the root
trouble, in three States at least, is the scandalous
excess of racing, of which the public can no longer
stand the strain.
* * * *
“W.J.A.K.”: Twenty years ago or there-
abouts my father ran a horse at the Hauraki Gulf
Maori meeting, where Rafferty’s rules obtained. Dad
r°de the animal himself, and Won with lOst. up.
iwmmated for the last race, the successful steed had
;? be re-handicapped, and Dad nearly fell down when
‘be president told him that the prad would have to
hump 2Gst. “But I can’t get enough lead to make
up that weight,” my progenitor protested. With a
lordly wave of the hand the Maori dismissed the sub-
ject. “Put two plurry men up,” he said.
“Gimlet W.”: In the 1922-23 racing season
Toohey, with 524 wins, 30 seconds and 28 thirds,
was Sydney's most successful jockey. Duncan topped
the Melbourne list with 31 wins, 27 seconds and 16
thirds. But over in Westralia Neville Percival rode
62 winners, 39 seconds and 31 thirds, and, unlike
Toohey and Duncan, he did all his work on Satur-
days and holidays. Percival, a “forward” rider of
the Conned type, was Easingwold’s horseman in the
West. His style just suited the son of Eaton Lad—
Bahloo, and the stable might do worse than get him
over for the chestnut’s Spring campaign.
* * * *
The Adelaide Racing Club and the
S.A.J.C., stirred up by the increasing competition of
Port Adelaide and Tattersall’s, have had spirited
competition for places on their committees. For the
A.R.C., F. G. Scarfe and S. E. Beach were sent in
again, but Loftus Moorhouse had a very close go for
the second place. For the four vacancies on the
S.A.J.C. there were eight candidates, with a poll
which went over 95 per cent, of the membership.
R. E. H. Hope and John Barker v the chairman)
were re-elected, and then came new blood, in Frank
Downer and R. M. Cudmore, both well known in the
polo- and hunting-fields. Defeated were Whyte and
L. W. Bakewell, sitting members of the committee;
also R. W. Bennett, one of the owners of King Ingoda.
“Monaro”: Two hares on the Woodstock
enclosure, Rooty Hill (N.S.W.), are just completing
their fifth season there, and have never been coursed.
Defying all efforts to pen them, they take the inter-
nal fences (4ft. high) in their stride, and the ease
with which they do it suggests they can leap out
of the enclosure whenever they like. But why should
they? They’re fed inside, and safe. Outside they’d
have to tucker themselves and be chased and shot
at like any other hare.
* * * *
J. O. Anderson’s high opinion of his own
prowess makes his cabled accounts of the Davis Cup
games rather trying to read. Charlie Macartney
wrote a cricket column last season with the mini-
mum of references to Charlie Macartney, but it
seems impossible for Anderson to describe a success
without dwelling fondly upon “the severity of my
service,” “my terrific forehand drives and smashes”
and the discomfiture of the other chap when “I con-
tinued playing beautifully” and “brilliantly,” the
presumptuous wretch being “completely outclassed.”
However, the self-admiring young man is certainly
playing fine tennis. After Hawkes had lost to
Shimidzu in the match with Japan (4 —6, 6 —3, 6—2,
I—6, 4—6), Anderson restored the situation by van-
quishing Fukuda (6 —1, 3—6, 6 —2, 6 —l). In the
doubles J.O.’s brilliance, combined with Hawkes’s
steadiness, disposed of Shimidzu and Kashio in 41
minutes (6 —1, 6—2, 6—2) ; and then Anderson
finished the match in a blaze of glory by defeating
Shimidzu in three straight sets (6—o, 6—3, 6 —3),
a feat which Tilden had pronounced impossible.
Hawkes also overcame Fukuda (6—3, 6—4, —3).
The Australians have now to meet the French team
at Boston, and if, as anticipated, they account for
the Gauls, they should have at least an outside chance
against the Americans, more especially as Tilden
doesn’t seem to be the Tilden of old. He and
Hayes were beaten in an exhibition match at Chicago
by Mclnnes and Schlesinger.
“15-30” : The only thing that can be said against
Hawkes in his match with Shimidzu is that he lacked
the temperament and judgment to convert a meri-
torious failure into a triumph. He started off with
a four-love lead in the first set, and apparently was
CHARLIE DICKIE, of Bacchus Marsh
(Vic.), whose dog Unie won the £1000
Waterloo Cup.
so paralysed at his success against a man who had
beaten him hollow two years before that he let the
Japanese capture a winning’ sequence of six games,
which no other man on earth, except, perhaps, Tilden
or Johnston, would have done under ordinary tourna-
ment conditions. Had the young man been armed
with the berserk courage of Gerald Patterson
Shimidzu would have been eliminated in three straight
sets. This seems a wild thing to say, but consider
the fact that Hawkes led five games to nothing in
the second session, and scored 6-3 in the third term,
also leaping into a 3-1 lead in the fifth. Only want
of a cool he?sd prevented his wrenching victory from
the Jap. Sh Imidzu showed great generalship in ex-
ploiting the Australian’s temperamental weakness,
but Hawkes eras unquestionably the better man on
stroke performs Bice. His service was better, his close
volleying was neater and more penetrating, and for
two sets he haii Shimidzu netting miserably off his
sharp forehand cuts. Why Hawkes let up, as he
seems to have d ene in the fourth set, is a mystery,
since he is now in a condition to go all he knows
for five rounds without taking any precautions to
save his wind. Of course the severe heat may have
been troublesome to the Australian, whereas it would
have appealed to Shimidzu, who, apart from a natural
hkmg for high temperatures, has been trained to
expect the worst through living in India. Against
F ukuda the young man from Geelong was never
in trouble. Anderson also found Fukuda much to
his liking. In the fourth chapter he indulged in a
cut-drop service which is a back-spinning lolly, occa-
sionally included in a champion’s repertoire but never
employed against a man of first-class consequence. It
can therefore be easily mistaken for a gesture of
contempt, and for that reason Anderson should not
.have, tried., it. The Sydney man took no liberties
, w . the sound Shiniidzu, his exhibition being
brilliant and almost without fault.
* * *
Although no title was at stake a Melbourne
crowd paid £2300 odd to see the return fight be-
tween Grime (N.S.W.) and Spargo. The thing went
rounds, all stoush and speed, and when the referee
gave it to the boy from the Riverina, 75 p.c. of the
congregation howled for his blood. Also, Spargo
told the reporters, in accents broken with emotion,
that he would risk his share of the gate on another
meeting. Grime really did most of the work and
was entitled to the verdict. But there was very
little in it, and no convention would have been
outraged had Quirk laid a large hand on each head.
Stadium, Ltd., played another of its ex-
qFs3.te. i oke ? 011 Saturday night, when Joe Herman,
of California, stood up for exactly 90sec. against
Young Butcher, the lightweight 'from Westralia.
Herman was advertised in Stadium literature as the
hero of 150 fights. They must have occurred in the
kindergarten.
The 34-year-old Adelaide pug, Era Waddy.
carried too weighty a punch for Charlie Taylor, the
Aramac (Q.) heavyweight, in a match for the cham-
pionship at Brisbane. Taylor was “out” when the
gong came to his rescue in the first round, and he
was floored six times in the second. Then the police
interfered. Waddy is too fast and too intelligent for
the present 'mob of Australian heavyweights. He is
a very interesting man to watch from outside the
ring, and perhaps the Sydney Stadium people will
get to hear of him when he is 44 or thereabouts and
the U.S. lemon crop is exhausted.
“Flicker”: Is it too late to have a go at
this argument about whether the Australian polo-
man rides as well, taken all round, as his prototype
in England? I’m here to say he does. In Egypt a
team composed of officers and men of the Australian
Div. ( and led by Major Clive Bleerhmore, of the 9th
Regiment, beat all-comers, including some of the
Indian cavalry. Then consider the crushing defeat
inflicted on Lord Dudley’s team in Adelaide during
that gay G.-G.’s period of office. Dudley, a great
polo enthusiast, brought along a team of crack
English cavalrymen. The S. Aus. men did what
they liked with them.

Henry F. Sullivan, a 31-year-old Yank, has
swum the English Channel at his seventh attempt.
Including the drift, he covered 56 miles, and was
26hr. 43min, on the job. Following Sullivan came
the Argentinan, Enrico Tiraboschi, who nearly did
the trick last year. Tiraboschi crossed from the
French shore in the wonderful time of 16J hours.
Swimming the Channel is evidently going to be a
regular pastime in the warm weather.
of the cash Darcy Hadfield dropped
in the championship race with Paddon he got back
on the Parramatta River by annexing a £l5O handi-
cap/ Paddon was also a starter, but the big fellow
finished weakly in his heat, and couldn’t start in
the final. He hadn’t quite recovered from an attack
of ’flu. The race was badly managed: beginning
nearly an hour late, it ended in the dark. Major
Goodsell (lOsec.), in receipt of 3sec. from Hadfield,
gave the Maorilander a good race for the big money ;
and among the lesser lights the best form was shown
by T. Saul, who finished fourth off 17see.
With its usual rotten sportsmanship, the
Rugby League refused to let the Soccer people have
the use of Sydney Cricket Ground for the opening
match against the Chinese, although its own fixtures
were unimportant. It is a monstrous thing that one
of the greatest sporting enclosures in the world should
be monopolised every winter by a greedy and churl-
ish professional body. As it happened, the League
gained nothing by its uncouthness, for its own games
were poorly patronised, while 50,000 people packed
the Show Ground, vacated for the occasion by the
Rugby Union. And then the sale of tickets had to
be stopped before the game began. The Chinese
got a great reception from as sporting a crowd as
was ever assembled, and proved a real surprise. Ably
led by Leung Yuk Tong, fast on their feet and tough,
they broke even —3 goals each —with a strong N.S.W.
side, after having led for the greater part of the game.
In Li Wai Tong they have as spry an inside left
as one could wish to see, and their goalie, Lau Iling
Cheung, was miles above the Sydney man at the
other end. Their long passes were uncommonly good,
and they will do still better when trained to the
minute —they were only five days off the boat. As
a factor in international football China has cer-
tainly arrived.
While the Orientals were showing their paces at
Sydney, another N.S.W. Soccer team won the rubber
in Queensland, scoring 5 goals against the Banana-
landers’ 2. They went through the tour without
defeat.
* * * *
“Leagueite”: Glebe, playing their best
game this season, administered a surprising defeat
to North Sydney. With a side made up of veterans
and apprentices, they charged last year’s premiers
gallantly, and soon had 12 points to nil. Then
Duncan Thompson, North’s skipper and one of the
cleanest players the game has known, was sent off
on a charge of having “put in the boot.” In his
absence North made a spirited fight of it, but at
the end Glebe were winners by a point—22 to 21.
In the other matches Western Suburbs trounced ’Var-
sity (14 to 8), South Sydney overcame Newtown
(25 to 7), and Eastern Suburbs gave St. George a
ghastly doing (24 to 2). On account of his alleged
breach Thompson has been suspended for the rest of
the season. That means, of course, that he can’t
represent N. S. Wales against Queensland. Peters has
also been omitted from the. team, as selected. "McMil-
lan goes in as custodian before Rigney, and the three-
quarters (excepting Robinson) are all wingers. The
pack is sound and representative, but if the Banana-
landers don’t waltz through the middle of the three-
quarter line, I’ll eat a football. Some of those
selected should be drawing the O.A.P.
O.R. : Now that it has been flatly denied
and disproved that Australian polo-players wear helmets
out of mere unreasoning imitativeness of an Indian
custom, I would like to ask why Australian Rugby
football champions must needs deck their heads, before
and after playing, with gorgeous velvet caps tasselled
and filleted with silver or gold. The curious thing
about this harmless peacockery is that it is practi-
cally reserved for the exponents of football’s most
virile code. Cricketers, Soccer-players and others
largely use their much less pretentious caps lor
playing in; the Rugby article represents pure orna-
ment or mere swank. The headgear, of course,
originated where the game did-—and where the
game’s centenary is shortly to be celebrated—in the
Rugby School close. Every house had its rightful
hue and emblem—cherished as regimental colors —
and the parade of arm-linked champions before big
matches was conducted as solemnly as if it were a
religious ritual. From there these decorative and
costly irrelevances have spread with the game until
one may encounter them hung up as immaculate
trophies in the shops of Sydney sporting outfitters.
At Rugby School there was a well-established tradi-
tion, 40 years ago, that these beauteous creations
were once worn on the field itself; and even in my
own time the shabbier and more faded a cap became
the greater its value.

Playing for the University R. U. team
against Old Boys Otto
Nothling, here illus-
trated, scored 22
points (5 tries and 3
goals) of the 60 piled
up by his team. Not
since the days of R.
C. McCo w a n, of
Queensland, has Aus-
tralia seen a full-
back so completely
equipped for his job.
Like McCowan and
H. P. Abbott, Nothling
learned to play the
game at Brisbane
Gratnmar School, and
took over the Uni.
fulPback position in
1020. Since 1921 he
has been the N.S.W.
full-back, and Spring-
boks, Maoris and All
Blacks have all found
him a champion. Six
feet high and 13st. in
weight, Otto is a
strong tackier and a
fine kick, as well as
having safe hands and
a wonderful knack of
anticipation—a great
asset in a full-back.
Besides his achieve-
ments at football he is a University track Blue, and
has represented N.S.W. on the cricket field. In short,
a melancholy example of the debilitating effects of
the Queensland climate.

With six teams striving to squeeze into
four places, the struggle in Vic. League football
gets fiercer, and on Saturday many players had to
retire injured. In the Ass., an excitable Williams-
tcwn man jobbed a Brunswicker, whereupon the
crowd rushed the ground, and only the Law saved
him from assault and battery. At Fitzroy, the
local players repeated their previous castigation of
Essendon—7B points to 57 this time; but the ’Dons
are practically certain of the minor premiership.
Geelong made a strenuous effort to keep their place,
but South Melbourne were even more determined
and gained the day by 70 points to 63. ’Wood did
themselves no good by going down before the Rich-
mond Tigers—ss points to 76 —chiefly owing to bad
kicking. They missed Dick Lee. St. Ivilda began
to see their “final” hopes fade as Melbourne put
on goal for goal, but a tremendous effort in the
last quarter gave Saints the victory by 84 points
to 49.
* * » *
“Trekle”: In Melbourne the disciplining
of players is now the fashion. Collingwood set it by
standing down an unruly fellow for some weeks. Then
Geelong announced that “Jumbo” Sharland, their best
follower, would not be in the team until further
notice. When, in 1921, Sharland emulated Liddicutt’s
feat of scoring a century against the Englishmen for
Geelong, while yet a schoolboy, Richmond took him
into their cricket XI. This year he applied for a per-
mit from Geelong to play football with the Tigers.
Though this was refused, he trained at Richmond,
and on two occasions did not play for his
team though chosen. Hence their action. The
biggest sensation, however, was supplied by
Carlton. They suspended Boromeo, Morrisey and
Bolt during their pleasure. It was notorious that
Carlton’s low position on the list was partly due to
internal strife, caused by their system of starving
local talent to pay big money to country stars; but
as Boromeo (a £6-a-week man) had initiated a
scheme for a flat rate for players, it was thought
that peace had come at last. Boromeo has been
dropped from the Victorian team that is to meet
South Australia. He will be a real loss.
However, the absence of Boromeo and his pals didn’t
prevent Carlton from giving a N.S.W. XVIII a lesson
at Erskineville (N.S.W.). The Ma Staters led by
58-56 at half-time, but Carlton woke up after that
and finished with 18 goals 16 behinds to 11 goals 6
behinds. O’Brien, the Carlton half-back, was the
best of the 36. The crowd numbered 10,000—an
excellent muster in the circumstances.

“Spikes”; Fred Kohlman, for two years
Victorian five-mile cross-country champion, lost the
title on Saturday to M. V. Boyd (St. Stephen’s),
runner-up to the Hawthorn athlete in the “ten” last
year and the “five” the year before. The Saints’
representative waited on Kohlman until the last lap,
and drew away after entering the straight, leaving
a 40yds. gap between himself and Kohlman, in
27min. 46jsee., with F. W. Page (also of St.
Stephen’s) third. As Vic. is about to select a team to
wrest Australasian honors from the Ma State at Rand-
wiek, there was a wild scramble for the first seven
places. One of the seven was Jock Bell, formerly of
Botany. St. Stephen’s made hacks of their oppo-
nents in the teams championship, which they won
for the fifth consecutive year with an excellent score
of 18 points, Melbourne (78 points) and Coburg
(85 points) filling the other places.
SWEET KISS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Frank Hayes, a jockey, died in the saddle on a
hew York racecourse while riding' his first winner,
Sweet Kiss. A hundred yards beyond the finish Hayes
rolled limply out of the saddle, dead. Sweet Kiss
stopped, and stood with drooping head beside the
fallen jockey.”
“Sweet Kiss! Sweet Kiss !” and “Good boy, Frank!”
they cried.
He’d given with his whip one timely touch.
“Bully for Frank! The boy’s first winning ride.”
Men spoke of how the lad had wasted much
To ride the weight, whilst, further up the course,
He’d ceased to be a weight upon the ’orse.
“H —l! Fallen from the saddle! Was he thrown?”
No more would Franky join in racing strife;
Throughout the struggle he had held his own,
But, having won their wagers, lost his life:
And there, beside her jockey lying dead,
The mare stood still and sad, with drooping head.
She missed the living burden from her back:
Had felt him falter, drop the reins, and fall;
Then, riderless, stopped short upon the track.
A sense of death so sudden might appal
The bravest heart of horse that ever beat:
Hew, in the field of triumph such defeat!
So, gazing at the form upon the grass,
The good mare mourned the passing of a friend;
She whinnied low the sound that spells “Alas!”
And wondered when would come her mortal end.
Meanwhile, boy Franky slumbered on in bliss:
To him the mare’s warm breath was Death’s sweet
kiss.
VICTORIA.

QUICK ACTION BRAKES
EXTRA LARGE AND EXTRA SAFE
In the construction of Dodge Brothers Motor
Car, every consideration has been given to the
owner’s safety.
This is particularly evident in the brakes,
which, with their 14-inch drums and
lining, are appreciably larger than the average.
Connecting levers are designed to transmit the
maximum of power with the minimum of
effort. The slightest pressure on the brake
pedal has an immediate effect.
And the brake bands grip evenly all around
the drums. This protects the lining against
irregular wear and enables the driver to stop
quickly, quietly and safely.

“Coot”: There are now only 84 full-
blooded blacks in Victoria. Only one was
born during the last 12 months, while four
died; there were no marriages. But there
are 328 half-castes at the three mission-
stations.
“Sucre”: “Bad Bill” (B. 26/7/’23) certi
fies that he heard the word “Pommy” used
in Brisbane over 22 years ago. Let me assure
him and anyone else whom it may concern
that 41 years ago come August next, when
I was a schoolboy, I heard the term applied
to immigrants at Toowoomba (Q.). And, for
all I know, it may be a lot older.
Edwin Cheal, the new president of the
Friendly Societies’ Association in N.S.W., is
a director of the Manchester Unity and prin-
cipal assistant botanist at the National Her-
barium in the Botanic Gardens. He is pre-
sident-elect of the Naturalists’ Society
(N.S.W.), of which he has been both sec.
and president; member of the Linnsean anti
Boyal Societies, a contributor to many scien-
tific journals, and an Australian.
Canowindra (N.S.W.) has just got a new
R.C. archdeacon. Patrick J. Doran is the
cleric promoted to the purple by Bishop
O’Farrell. He was born in Maitland
(N.S.W.) in ’67, and, caught young as a
telegraph-operator in the local post office,
was sent by the late Bishop Byrne to get the
necessary ecclesiastical polish in the Cold
Country. A brother, for whom all Sydney
strap-hangers pray fervently, is tramway-
chief T. J. Doran.
“T. 0.1.” : Two Sydney pubs with a mild
interest for local antiquaries will soon be
closed under an order of the Licenses Reduc-
tion Board. One is the Beehive, in Princes-
street, a house said to have been built out
of the stone from the “Argyle Cut.” The
other, the Hit or Miss, in Windmill-street,
has an even older history; Governor Mac-
quarie granted the site to an Irishman from
Cavan named Stevens. The tavern remained
in the family until The Rocks were resumed,
when the then owner, the late J. M.
Stevens, received compensation for it and
the adjoining flats, the latter being the first
of their kind built in Sydney.
“Enery James”: A recent piercing cry
from an Australian bookseller regarding the
high prices he has to charge for popular
fiction from Britain, the implication being
that the British publisher is an exceedingly
hungry fellow, moves me to declare how
far the 'wail is justified. A cheap edition of
a former Best Seller, marked 2s. 6d. here,
can be landed for Is. sd. A tliree-and-six-
penny yarn costs Is. lid. to place on .the
bookstands, and a six-shilling work by a
popular fictioneer puts 2s. 6d. into the re-
tailer’s pocket. No wonder the poor wretch
gets wild when the general-store bookseller
is content with 55., or even 4s. 9d., for the
same sort of novel!
“Skyrider”: Many an old-time drover will
hear with regret that John Thomas Rowe, of
Exeter (N.S.W.), went out on the last, long
track the other day. The big-hearted old
chap—he was 80—was for over 40 years
overseer on Arthursleiglr for Holt and Bad-
gery Bros., and never a traveller or a drover
passed through the run without a meal and
a helping hand. Often when the river was
in flood he took his old horse and convoyed
passengers across the stream, and when his
prad was the only one which would face the
water it carried a double burden. Rowe was
a native of .Liverpool (N.S.W.). Six of
his 11 children are dead —one, Walter, lies
under the poppies in France.
“Verey Light” on an old sportsman: —
Lord Darnley, one of the English peers who find it
no longer possible to maintain a stately family seat,
used to be the Hon. Ivo Bligh, who captained the
English XI in 1882. During the war he turned
over portion of Cobham Hall, in Kent, for use as a
convalescent home for officers of the A.1.F., and they
found it very good. The Earl’s interest in sport
seemed as keen as ever, and in my time he provided
from his own pocket for cricketing and football
material for the staff; but, though lie often looked
on, he could never be induced to take bat or ball.
Of course most of his cricket memories were of men
and days too far back for most of us; but the Digger
with anything to say of present-day Australian
cricket (and football, too, particularly League)
found him an attentive listener. To the Digger who
knew his Dickens there were many associations in
Cobham Hall and around it; in the grounds there
was a chalet in which Charles had done a good deal
of his work. If Charles’s spook was hanging round
there its humorous sense may often have been tickled
at the spectacle of a petticoated “auxiliary” soldier
canoodling with a be-starred officer, or a Clara Vere
de Vere having honeyed nothings breathed into her
ear by a soldier from overseas. Of late Cobham has
been let; an American millionairess was paying
£lOO a month for it last year, and it was reckoned
dirt-cheap at the price.
“H.S.”: One of the new psychologists
may explain why Charles Hawtrey, a model
of stage correctness and order, should have
been the most undisciplined of men. He held
the insolvency championship in a profession
where the competition is keen. All his life
he was associated with successes, yet he
rarely had any money. Two things enabled him
to live in luxury despite recurring bank-
ruptcies and hordes of clamorous tradesmen
—charm of manner and knowledge of the
debtor and creditor laws. He was the author
of a clevic: which constitutes a sort ot
Magna Charta for penurious English mum-
mers. Chronically hard-up actors are not
foolish enough to own anything that can be
distrained on, and bankruptcy has no terrors
for them. The danger used to lie in the
garnisheeing of their salaries. A garnishee
order attaches a salary only when it is
“due and owing,” and the date has to appear
iih the document. Hawtrey arranged with
the treasury to pay him a day before the
usual date, and his salary was therefore not
“due and owing” when the order was pre-
sented. Hawtrey accepted his financial dif-
ficulties with the bland helplessness that he
put to such good use on the stage; nearly all
Ms. abest-remembered witticisms had to do
with the humors of insolvency. Socially he
was extremely popular. He belonged to the
Orleans Club, which shares with the St.
James’s the patronage of members of the
Diplomatic body, and here the movement
which resulted in his being knighted last
year was begun, as-

At Melbourne King’s “Plis House in
Order continues to furnish Irene Vanbrugh
and Boucicault with a lion and a lioness’s
share of histrionic opportunity. They take
two or three good dramatic meals tete-d-tete,
the play, showing every consideration for
stars living in a house w’here interruptions
are otherwise frequent. The lady, however,
gdts little occasion for saying much apart
frpm Dion Boucicault, whereas he talks
freely in other private discussions, firstly
with the stilted Majah, next with Martin
Walker as Pryce Ridgeley, and then with
C. M. Hallard as Filmer Jesson, M.P., when
that unpleasant husband learns that his late
beloved Annabelle was no patient angel on
the strict q.t. This is where Boucicault
may be said to serve the leading lady a rather
mean trick. Having previously persuaded
her to forbear from revealing aught about the
indiscretions of Annabelle, in the interests
of the family delusion and little Derek’s sup-
posed legitimacy, Hilary Jesson (Dion afore-
said) now proceeds to blow the gaff to his
self-satisfied brother, and make him wise to
the fact that the rather terrible kid has no
blood of the. Jessons in his young veins.
Poor Nina might just as well have had the
satisfaction of hurling the truth at her hus-
band in a forcible interview, seeing that
brother Filmer was told it, after all, and
little Derek had to be left in a most invi-
dious position. Instead of the petted child
of the house, Derek becomes in a moment
the nasty kid who has no business there at
all, since his unlawful father has, in the
words of Boucicault, been “kicked out.” But
the present bill is not for long. Nothing is
to be for long during the present season, says
the advt. The next production will be “Mr.
Pirn Passes By.”
On Saturday, at Melbourne Roval, a short
revival of “The Sentimental Bloke” will
bring back the people who last year “created”
Dennis’s characters at the King’s. The revi-
val, however short, will be sweet, and, as a
kindly apology for “The Cat and the Canary,”
very acceptable.

Moiseiwitscb in concerto with Zelraan’s
Symphony Orchestra gave a delightful
matinee entertainment at Melbourne Town
Hall last Saturday. To fully appreciate the
work of the mostly young and mostly girl
musicianers who make it a labor of love
under Alberto Zelman’s guidance, one must
have a pretty vivid recollection of how Mar-
shall Hall’s orchestra of old accompanied
Carreno in Beethoven’s “Emperor” Concerto.
Then the pianist appeared to be the only
person on the platform familiar with the
task, whilst on Saturday the pianist, the
conductor and the little orchestra seemed to
have a bond of sympathy in their melodious
undertaking. The performance of a Tschai-
kowsky concerto was almost equally effec-
tive in a less melodious way, and, apart from
these chief items, the orchestra improved its
reputation with a quite charming rendering
of Mendelssohn’s “Ruy Bias” overture, and
the familiar Massenet piece from “Thn ; -
the violin solo portion falling to Bertha Jor-
gensen, who looks almost as juvenile as the
youngest of her colleagues.
* * * *
Melbourne Town Hall was so full in the
afternoon that a reduction in quantity was
naturally looked for at the Evelyn Scotney
concert in the evening; but the charmer had
a very numerous audience. The appearance
and manner of this singer go for as much as
her brilliant light soprano. Her festive
frocking and her rapid cheerio gait were remi-
niscent of the tennis-court, and always she
and her snappiest ditties harmonised in all
resnects. Moreover, there is a capital accom-
panist in Welsford Smithers, and a note of
praise can be sounded for young Leslie Bark-
lam, who supplied the flute obbligato to Han-
del’s “Sweet Bird.” Barklam, by the way,
is now tall enough to be put into long pants.
The other vocalist was James Hill, whose
fluent light basso was most effective in the
swectly-tuneful “Infelice” from old “Ernani.”
The Scotney concert this Saturday will be a
matinee, and next week the winsome little
lady will be there again on Wednesday and
Friday evenings.

“The Beggar’s Opera,” at Sydney Palace,
with its brave array of early eighteenth-
century crooks and their charmers, is win-
ning nightly eulogies. It’s full of literary
interest as well as telling lines and lingering
melodies. Who -was it wrote “Beneath full
wigs no lyric drew its breath?” Gay’s master-
piece knocks 15 holes in it, whoever its
parent was.
SS *
At Sydney Cri. “Enter Madame” continues
to show Gertrude Elliott in sparkling vein
and radiant attire. The play ripples
piquantly along and the frocking is calcu-
lated to reconcile quite a number of people
to the fall of our First Parents in Eden.
“Bulldog Drummond” brings up 50 on the
scoring-board at Sydney Grand Opera House
next Monday, and everybody who goes to the
party will leave with a souvenir photo of
the dashing and debonair G. H. Mulcaster.

“Mary” of the tripping toes and the twink-

Sydney Majesty’s. ‘“The Cabaret Girl,” an-

Ruby Norton’s entertainment of the Syd-
ney Tivoli congregation carries a serial-story
touch. Week by week she appears in a new
instalment of wonderful frocks and with a
fresh batch of melodies to appease the Oliver
Twists in front. The thread that runs
through the whole is “Croajingalong” ; and
even in spite of that the blonde-haired visitor
remains head and shoulders above the rest
of the programme. Yet Edgar Benyor, who
has nalf-a-dozen or more props to lean on,
from tying himself into a quadratic equation
to mislaying his voice, is good; and Ristori,
who dabbles in impersonation, plays the
violin more than passably.

Of part-singing and choral work, as ren-
dered by the Westminster Glee Singers, Syd-
ney can’t have enough. The concerts have
been listened to by crowded houses that have
greeted such melodic works as the Faust
numbers and Moore’s Melodies with rounds
of applause. Monday night’s opening chorus,
“The Hunt Is Up,” from the pen of Hatton,
started the programme with a swing, and
after that perhaps the most popular combined
numbers were the Waltz Song from “Romeo
and Juliet” and the Barcarolle. The lark-
light notes of Albert Cooper and Edmund
Walter would gain them a lead among a
sky-full of chanting cherubim. Extra num-
bers are given lavishly; many of them are
“by request.” But even most obliging Brans-
combe, viewing his company of six adults
and six small boys, had to smilingly declare
that the power wasn’t quite sufficient on
Saturday evening for “The Hallelujah
Chorus.” The concerts will be continued
till Saturday evening.

“The Hottentot,” at Sydney Lyceum, is
not the latest craze in sheiks, but a jibbing
prad upon which a quaking hero with but a
limited equestrian knowledge is expected to
accomplish big things. Of course he comes
up to scratch; in the true screen way; in real
life there would probably be a fool’s funeral.
“Remembrance” occupies the other half, and
between the two is wedged a ventriloquist
and a close-up of the Etna eruption. “The
iVth Commandment,” although absent from
the stone slab presented to Moses, is chanted
exuberantly a thousand times or so a day
by the Strand spruiker. It concerns itself
with drapery-emporium morals; so you can
guess a bit. On top of that there is “Man
and Wife,” a skimmed-milk attempt to con-
done bigamy. “The Man Above the Law” is
released at the Rialto, where also souls are
whitewashed at cut rates. “The Face on the
Bar-room Floor” is keeping half the Beerage
away from the Majestic, and an angel chee-ild
is a self-appointed strike arbiter at the
Empress. At the Piccadilly, “Trifling
Women” are juggling with half the male
population of some fictitious Debrett. The
Strand is still offering a peep into the by-
ways and side-lines of Moviedom, and Doug.
Fairbanks has entered the fifth lap at the
Crystal Palace.

Galsworthy’s “Loyalties,” as played by the
Repertory Theatre in Adelaide recently to
two crowded audiences, is true Repertory
work, in that it presents both sides with fair-
ness. This keeps its powerful plot from
degenerating into melodrama. The young
Jew guest in a country house, who has £lOOO
taken from under his pillow and is regarded
as a bounder when he suggests the guilt of
a popular fellow-guest, is up against all the
British clannishness which the title neatly
suggests. Still, his suspicion is right, and
the gradual closing of the net on the jolly
young thief makes effective tragedy, of the
Greek school. The play should be a success
in any theatre and with any public, it re-
quires an unusually large cast, and Wilfred
Neill, the producer, was fortunate in finding
a lot of new recruits, young men with great
promise. The old hands showed up well.
Ray Walsh dominated the lot; he has never-
done better work. His dignified and almost
persecuted young Jew may or may not be
just the “little Ferdie” of the author’s,
imagining, but it scooped in the whole sym-
pathy of the audience. He did for the
character, in fact, just What Irving did for
Shy lock a generation back. Walsh has the
great gift of “holding” the stage when he is
not speaking; amateurs less gifted make the
scene drag when they try it.
Penleigh Boyd takes his show south :
The European Art Exhibition has come to Mel-
bourne and is housed in the main hall of the
Athenaeum. It is a profound disappointment. There
is a great array of names, but little striking achieve-
ment. The Sargent portrait is a mediocre thing;
the Augustus Johns are mere sketches; Lavery i?
the author of a small racing scene showing a strip
of vivid turf and an uninteresting mob of idlers ;
Brangwyn’s “Game of Euchre” reveals a young and
early disposition to narrative painting, for which
he apologises in his “Turkish Sweetmeat Seller”;
Orpen has a pale, sweet lady with nice hands, but
attention rather flags after studying her beautiful
shawl; and the Hon. John Collier, who is awarded
a proud position on the platform for his “Prodigal
Daughter,” is about the last word in Travelling
Scholarship art, of which there are less flamboyant
examples in Walter Russell’s “Interior” and Isabel
Codrington’s “La Taberna.” Gerald Kelly’s “Siesta”
is a good nude, soft, alluring and well proportioned;
but the background is unworthy. We get a grey
soothing Thamescape with some effectively depicted
trees from H. J. Gunn; an “October Morning” by
Algernon Talmadge would be pleasing but for the
flourish of electroplated high lights; Hughes Stan-
ton’s “Equihen, France,” is an unimpressive immen-
sity ; and Howard Somerville’s “Eileen” has charm,
especially in the texture of the dress; Connard
Phillip’s “Passing Shadows over Sutton Marshes” is
rather agreeable, and George Thomson’s still-life of
pink roses is beautiful in its simplicity. In the
French section the styles are various and you take
your choice. Between the steady realism of “Arabs
regardant une danse rituelle” and the stodgy absur-
dity of Walter Gay’s “Throne Room of Napoleon I. at
Fontainebleau” there is a world of uncomprehended
effort, represented by landscapes like snapshots of
submarine aquariums and visions of colored lights
that one might see after colliding with a cathedral
or a ’bus. The Germans are pretty sane, on the
whole, and among their canvases the eye fixes on
Albert Birkle’s portrait, which recalls a Simplicis-
simtjs caricature, yet carries an extraordinary con-
viction. Among the etchings, drawings and litho-
graphs one notices an unaffected and unexaggerated
nude by Anders Zorn and a Rothenstein lithograph
of a bearded personage which is alleged to be
H. G. Wells.

A quiet show in Melbourne: —
The outstanding feature of the Twenty Painters’
show at the Melbourne Athenaeum is a singularly
brilliant still life by Miss A. M. E. Bale. It is only
a small study of dahlias in a bowl, but it arrests
attention for its craftsmanship. Miss Bale’s portrait
of Miss Swaatman is not so good. It is representa-
tive of the tired orthodoxy of the schools. Victor
Cobb, who hangs a - decent etching of a gum-tree,
.floors the spectator with an impression of a camellia.
A. E. Newbury makes the bush haunting to the
wistful city-dweller in seven first-class landscapes, of
which “The Gum Paddock” has a delightful charm.
Arnold Shore seems to be demonstrating an intellec-
tual fighting attitude in two self-portraits, but he
scores with a still-life of autumn oakleaves, very
faithfully presented. William Rowell’s best pro-
duction is “The Pool,” and his brother John signs
a delicate seaside effect entitled “Towards Evening.
W. Frater’s art continues to blanch at the idea of
painting honest sunlight, with the result that his
most joyous canvases are somewhat faint and for-
bidding.' When he really paints winter, as !n
AT “BOHEMIA," IN BRISBANE.
The Bluetts', Gas and Fred, as Mr. Gallagher
and Mista Shean.
No. 73, you regret that you have left your muffler
and goloshes at home. His portrait of his two
sons has many points about it; some of the model-
ling -is weak, but the workmanship is honest and
uncompromising, as compared with the slick and
shallow performance of George Bell in “Mother
and Child.” E. Kimpton’s two canvases of Emu
Creek merely give a few dead-tree trunks in a
slobber of green, and Alan Gallagher’s “Trees in
Winter Time” is an oleographic illustration without
any atmospheric quality whatever. C. Hampel s
“Summer Morning, Derwent Valley,” is commend-
able, but is an unequal achievement. An early
peach called “Pierrette” comes from the brush
of Mrs. Tweddle, but the striking painting else-
where ruins one’s taste for pink flapperhood m
ingratiating drapery. The “Pierrette” sort of pic-
ture stands to Art what the puff par is to Litera-
ture.

“Fax” in a genealogical mood: —
The present Dion Boucicault was not christened
with the name of his famous father. The label fell
upon him in natural succession after the death of his
elder brother Dion William, the hero of a tragedy,
long forgotten, in January, 1876. Dion William
was journeying to London from the North of Eng-
land to be present at the final performance of the
first season of Dad’s “Shaughraun.” The express
train was not a couple of miles on its way when it
was wrecked by a collision with some trucks, and
young Dion, with a broken arm, was among the
luckless passengers. Three ladies lay near him on
the upward track, beside a steep embankment. With
his uninjured arm he helped two of them up the
embankment. The .express from London was already
rumbling near when he raised the third woman
from the track and held her out of harm’s way.
But the train came along ere he could save himself,
and the 20-year-old boy was killed. The younger
brother, whom Australia knew first as a member of
his dad’s company, then as an actor under engage-
ment to Williamson, Garner and Musgrove, and
afterwards as partner with Robert Brough, was regis-
tered as Darley George, and became generally known
as “Dot.” He was born in New York, like his
elder sister, Eve, whereas three younger members of
the family were born in London. Memory fails me
as to whether I saw “Dot” Boucicault himself in
his playlet adapted from Walter Besant’s novel “My
A PAINFUL SUBJECT.
FELLOW PASSENGER: “I should think that
you cannot fail, sir, during your travels
about the country, to be much impressed
by our vast empty spaces."
HORATIO ( returning from unsuccessful
tour): “True, sir; too true. I HAVE
noticed them."
Little Girl,” and produced at the Court Theatre more
than 40 years ago. I remember only that the play
was a pleasing little thing which had a good run,
and that I wondered whether the boy-author was
much indebted to his father for assistance in the
writing of it. How the famous old man earned the
disrespect of young “Dot Dion” and pretty htt |®
sister Nina before he left them in Australia is
another story. Likewise a tradition that the original
Dion Boucicault was known as Dion Lardner Bosa
court in his youthful days.
“Norbell”: Other theatrical chiefs besides
Charles Frohman disliked making written
contracts B. 9/8/’23) . “Drunolanus’
Harris was one. James M. Glover tells of
how Harris bought in Paris a halt-interest m
“Champignol Malgrg Lui” from Fred
Horner. At a subsequent supper Horner
anxiously asked, “What about the money and
the contract, Sir Augustus?” Harris picked
up a menu card and scribbled a contract
across it, remarking in hurt tones: ‘De
Reszke, Melba and hundreds of others never
had a contract with me. -My -word was
always good enough for them.” George Mus-
grove was another entrepreneur whose
spoken word was his bond, and he suilered
heavily on occasion for his casualness with
some unscrupulous stars. I have seen him
in person paying out the large salaries ot
a big touring co., and getting ‘Thanks,
guv’nor,” as his only receipt.
From Somewhere-in-Cockaigne:—
Rack in England, D’Alvarez has been telling the
reporters that she found the Australians “kind, hos-
pitable people, and excessively proud of their cli-
mate.” She thinks the climate is a potent factor in
the production of the beautiful voices she heard
there. In one afternoon she judged 180 voices, “all
marvellous.” This, no doubt, will start another north-
ward flight of Aussie songbirds, and the South Ken-
sington boarding-houses are full of them already.
Melba has discovered another prodigy. He is a
Russian refugee named Alexis Obolensky a prince, of
course —and he sang at her farewell concert in the
Albert Hall. “Prince Obolensky is a great find,” says
the diva, so many of whose swans have suffered an
ornithological sea-change. By the way, wasn’t there
a Prince Obolensky in Syd'pey a year or two ago,
drumming for tree-pullers, or something ?
“Orb”: Athol Forde, now playing in
“Enter Madame” at Sydney Criterion, was
with George Musgrove’s Shakspearean co. m
1903 when “A Midsummer Night’s Dream
was produced by Robert Courtneidge. This
production was, of course, “on a scale ot
magnificence never before attempted in Aus-
tralia,” and for once there was some warrant
for the assertion. Forde played Quince, and
subsequently was the Adam of “As You
Like It.” Croker-King, W. H. Denny,
Charles Kenningham, Alfred Bucklaw, Nora
Kerin, Dora Rignold and Margaret Cellier
were also of the co. Courtneidge himselt
appeared during that season as Professor
Seneca Peckering Peck in the farcical
comedy “On ’Change,” Athol Forde playing
James Burnett.
“Nella”: “A.R.C.” says (B. 9/8/’23) that
J. Houson (? Howson) was the first Aus-
tralian Macheath, to Mrs. Stirling’s Polly,
at the old Vic., Sydney, in 1840. The re-
search officials of Sydney Public Library can
trace no production of the opera earlier than
Anniversary Night, 1864, when, under Lys-
ter’s management at the Opera House (Syd-
ney), Georgia Hodson was Macheath and
Emma Neville Polly. They can’t both be
right.
From “0.K.,” critic and psychologist:—
A novice on the stage needs luck as well as intelli-
gence to get her into notice as quickly as Phyllis Maj,
the Sydney girl, arrived there in Melbourne. Phyllis
started in one of the many pin-spot parts provided
by Oscar Asche’s “Cairo.” Then she was passed
along to the Gertrude Elliott co., and did her little
bit as one of the bridesmaids in the wedding scene
of “Smilin’ Through.” She would have remained
with the same co. in a humble capacity, but it hap-
pened that Mrs. Allan Brooks, just arrived from
overseas, fell ill ere she could appear at Melbourne
Tivoli in her husband’s humorous little tragedy,
“Dollars and Sense.” Phyllis May just fitted the part
of the wife in the tale, and her manner of speech
enabled the inexperienced young actress to be quite
a success in her quite considerable job. She is mote
than satisfactory. She accentuates the author s
satire. She presents that sort of character to the
life —and a bit over. No girl, in the same circum-
stances, was ever so utterly heartless as the heartless
minx in “Dollars and Sense.” How these clever young
actresses do love to assume a wickedness, though they
have it not! In the course of early training as proper
young ladies they have “sweetness of disposition
drilled into them until its saccharine quality some-
what sickens them. What, is it the smart flappei
says to the Philanderer in Shaw’s comedy? Speak-
ing of his apparent success with women, because lie
takes them as a matter of course, she confides: “You
don’t know how tired girls get of being treated with
the respect due to their sex.” That respect nauseates
an up-to-date matron with a too-adoring husband.
On the stage, anyhow. Off the stage and outside
novels I’ve never met the too-adoring sort. Any
lady who looks hard for a cave-man will surely find
him, and presently wish she hadn’t.
“Uloola”: Someone mentioned recently
that Alf Woods didn’t last long at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney. True, but it wasn t be-
cause be was a bad actor and a worse man
of business. King Hedley, a Yankee, mum-
mer, here in the ’nineties, sold Woods the
“rights” of a melodrama, and Alt was re-
hearsing the atrocity when Bland Holt fired
in an injunction restraining lum from pro
ducing it. Woods fought and lost the case,
and the cost just about ruined him. Ihe
co (I was in it) had to go without
screws, and the late Harry Leston was so
wild that he threatened to take it out o:
Alf’s hide, declaring that Woods was the
onlv man who had ever failed to come t
liglit with his salary. But friends intervened
to prevent actual hostilities For
perhaps, for Harry, since Alf could go a
bit with the gloves.
“Santander”: Though the elder Dion
Boucicault left four children, only one of
them Eve, has had offspring, to wit the
brothers Dion and Donald Clayton Calthrop.
Dion, who is 10 years older than Donald,
has written novels and plays, and is part-
author with Harry Graham of the T irm s
big success, “The Southern Maid.” Donald
is an actor with a considerable reputation.
He has played in Shakspeare, Shaw, Barrie,
Galsworthy and Granville Barker, has toured
America with* Maxine Elliott, and is one
of the few English actors who have impressed
German audiences. Probably his two finest
parts are Mr. Darling in “Peter Fan and
Eugene Marchbanks in Shaw s “Candida.
The Calthrops are descended from an old
English squire who left a tribe of children.
Richard Webster, who became Lord _ Alver-
stone, was their father’s second cousin.
In the bad old days:—
Recent revelations of Cissie Loftus’s weakness in
the matter of drug-taking reminded me that her
mother was not lacking in courage, moral or physical.
Marie Loftus, a dashing serio-chronic most of the
A PROLONGED SOLILOQUY.
JOHN HOP (to inebriate addressing space): “You'd better be gain
home, ’ Amlet. You’ve been there talkin' to yerself long enough."
year and a principal boy at Christmas-time, played
heroine in a theatrical feud with a gang of Birming-
ham blackmailers more than 30 years ago. In those
days music-hall women visiting Birmingham went in
fear of robbery and violence if they refused to
“shell out” to a crowd of young ruffians who had
succeeded to what had been an ordinary claque.
Jennie ilill, mother of Peggy Pryde, was attacked
whilst going from the stage-door to her brougham.
Bessie Bonehill, another bill-topper of the period,
w r as made to buy her freedom from fear of worse
annoyance. When Marie Loftus arrived to fill a
panto, engagement the toughs pursued her with im-
portunities and threats because she refused to be
blackmailed. At last she went to the police. They
framed up a scheme which required Alice Leamar
and two other girls to be waiting for Marie in the
house where she lived, while a “rozzer” hid behind
the curtain in her sitting-room. The expected young
ruffians skulked in Teadiness for the panto, boy when
she reached home after the performance. It was
Saturday night, and they meant to force the lady to
cash up. She sweetly invited the ringleader to come
inside and arrange a settlement. He did. The settle-
ment was a promise from the blackmailer that no
more actresses should suffer if kind Miss Loftus let
him go free, with the consent of the kind policeman.
“Mancam”: Surely “Gnarek” is confusing
Chevalier with Charles Godfrey when he
says (B. 9/8/’23) that “Chevalier included
yokel, Chelsea-pensioner and heavy-tragedian
items in his music-hall repertory.” “Chivvy”
never did the. Chelsea Pensioner etc. God-
frey did (“Seventh Royal Fusileers ).
Chevalier stuck to his costers on the vaude-
ville stage. During the run of William
and Susan” (a revision of Black-eyed
Susan,” by W. G. Wills) at the St. James s,
in the early ’eighties, “Chivvy played a
small part. He dressed in the same room
as Charles Ivenningham—Charles was
“walking on” at los. a week—and used to do
his coster stuff in the dressing-room Iven-
ningham advised him to see Charles Morton,
the Alhambra manager. He and
promptly “knocked ’em m the Old • e ?i
Road.” Chevalier never forgot that friendly
“urge,” and the two actors were lirelong
friends.
“Bello” : Daisy Jerome has had an adven-
ture at Mount Victoria (N.S.W.) which has
set all the Blue Mountain parrots taikmg.
Daisv was out driving in a sulky, and was
having a tete-a-tete with the local rector,
Bev T. F. Heffernan, when the horse became
distracted, and emptied Daisy out, and then
overturned the vehicle on top of her. The
parson gallantly rescued the ’villainess, of
course, but the mountain cats are saying that
the horse became delirious because he heard
DMsy explaining what made the Mountains
Blue.
•Mud”: P. G. Wodehouse is mainly re-
sponsible’ for the libretto of “The Cabaret
Girl” shortly to be produced in Sydney;
George Grossmith, brother of “Applejohn”
Lawrence, lent a helping stylo. It has had
a °ood run at London’s Winter Garden
Theatre, which is on the site of the old “Mo”
(Mo°ul) music-hall, Drury-lane. The piece
will serve to re-introduce Alfred Frith, who
will have the part in which Leslie Henson
is enjoying himself in the English production.
So the “fat” will be Frith’s as of yore.
“Timson”: An older
generation of play-
goers will remember
the Brough - Bouci-
cault production of
“Little Jack Shep-
pard” at Melbourne
Opera House during
Christmas, 1880.
Robert Brough was
Jonathan Wild, Emma
Temple was Winifred
Wood, and Teddy
Royce Blueskin. But
the cherry in this
early Martini was
Fanny Rubina, the
wife of F. Stanislaus,
leader of the orches-
tra. One of my
elderly relatives to
whom the blandish-
ments of present-day
stars are like whisky-
on a prohibitionist’s
back, still talks of
Fanny with a kindling
eye. She had the
fairest figure, the love-
liest legs and the
sweetest voice ever,
and he is wont. to
warm his recollections
by going up to inspec
a'photo of the nymph
which he keeps framed
on the mantelpiece
of his dining-room. 1
think I have seen finer
legs, and I showed
him lately a photo or
the Parisienne, Mis-
tinguette, whose limbs
are being modelled in
plaster for the paraly-
sis of posterity; but
he only sniffed and
said: “They don t
grow ’em like they
used ter do.” Alas, Age has its illusions
as well as Youth !
“ILE.R.”: We were doing ‘ The Forged
Will” in the School of Arts in a waybaclv
Bananaland town. The players, all local ama-
teurs, had been in training throughout tnc
summer, but when the time came tor the villa n
to forge the name of the heroine’s rich tamer,
who lav stabbed at his feet, an unrehearsed
effect occurred. Dad had fallen lifeless with
his face to the mirthful audience. Instead
of remaining extinct, he suddenly sat up.
“Rheumatism,” he explained briefly. Ann
then, as an afterthought: ‘lt s gom to rain
before daylight.” Then he swung over and
obliged the villain by dying agam. Beto e
the performance was over, by the way, lain
was pouring down.
“Norbell” : Apropos Marie Tempest s boii-
over with “Good Gracious, Annabelle a
Duke of York’s, London, Thomas Moult m
John o’ London’s speaks of Mane as _ a
radiant star shining for eight years m dar
and distant places, such as the backwoods
of Australia.” The superior critics who
write in dark and distant places hke Worm
wood Scrubs, Shepherds Bush
backwoods are nothing if not picturesq
and accurate.
“Plasmon” : I was tickled to learn from a
recent cable that the film-actress Pola Aeg
had parted with Charlie Chaplm again, and
was now bragging about her friendship wi
Tilden, the tennis-player. What am ol
graces Tilden commands to take the lancj
of a connoisseur like Negri I was never able
to discover during his appearance in aus

THE SUPERFLUOUS SUPER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“An extraordinary incident occurred during the
marriage service at an Auckland suburban Methodist
Church. The minister had just reached the most im-
pressive part of the ritual when the gravity of the
congregation was upset by the appearance of a
white goat, which walked down the aisle and collided
forcibly with the bride.” —Sydney Sun.
To the maiden who’d sprint to the altar, a hint
Is conveyed in this harrowing news;
Though hugging and squeezing may not be displeasing,
A butting may end in a bruise;
And just as she vows that she’ll honor her spouse,
And love, and obey, and revere,
No daughter of Eve would rejoice to receive
An unlooked-for assault in the rear.
She’s bound to feel silly if bumped by a Billy,
As the organ booms out o’er the shrine
Its deep diapason, for none but a Mason
Expects such a biff on the spine;
These capricorn capers, when starred in the papers,
Each bridesmaid and bride must deplore;
So, ladies, take care! When a husband you snare,
With the wolf keep the goat from the door.

The Directors desire to place on record their deep sense of loss through the death, on
18th March last, of Sir Thomas Allwright Dibbs, Honorary Director and formerly
General Manager of this Bank. Having joined the Bank in July, 1847, he was thus closely
associated with it for nearly 76 years. For a great part of that time he was one of the
most prominent figures in Australian Banking, and it is always recognised that this Bank,
as it stands to-day, is a monument to his ability and faithful service.
In terms of Article 94 the Hon. James Ashton, M.L.C., was appointed a Director,
to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of the Hon. Sir Thomas Hughes, M.L.C., in
February last.
Mr. Ashton is now eligible for election, and has given notice of candidature.
This Meeting is called upon to elect a Director, consequent on the retirement in terms
of the Articles of Association of the Honorable James William Macarthur Onslow,
M.L.C., who is eligible for re-election, and has given the requisite notice that he is a
candidate for the office.
It rests also with this Meeting to appoint Auditors for the ensuing year.
During the year branches of the Bank have been established at Copmanhurst, Double
Bay, Hamilton, Lane Cove, Lindfield, and Tarcutta, in New South Wales, and at Mount
Larcom and \Vowan, in Queensland. The Branch at Humula, in New South Wales, has
been closed.
The Dividend is now' payable.

THE clean, new, sanitary
way to shave is with
Mennen Shaving Cream
which quickly softens the
stiffest beard and reduces it
to complete subjection. You
shave easily, quickly and
comfortably, and your skin
is smooth as velvet afterward.
You feel delightfully refreshed.
Scores of men now prefer the
Mennen way to any other. It is a
fine improvement over the old way.
Try it once. You’ll always be glad,
if you do. For sale at all the best

run dry IC. Savral: Unsuitable I-bai: Not
'cry attractive in that form, though there’s good
stuff hidden in it... .G.O’H.: Must take its chance
with the rest.... Reoh: Any shipping man will ex-
plain those things to you. . . .R.T.8.: That argument

P.: The rather confused method just turned the
scale against it... .F.A.C.: Go in for a course of
ear-tuning... .N.A.E.: No golden grain in that sheaf.
.. . .R.N.S.: The verse is weak and goes on crutches.
....S.D. (Dunedin): Lame in all its various feet,
weak in the head and thinly clad... .C.C.M.: It
is too bald without rhymes.... E.V.L.: The little
string of jolty lines gets to nothing worth while....
Boundary Rider 32: The verse doesn’t scan well and
the matter is too slight; but it is nicely phrased....
Fred A.: The yarn isn’t much, and the verse is too
ragged to help it... . Laurel B.: Those nice old things
about dear mother ought to be told in better verse
than that. .. -H.B. (Junee) : Try it in a better metre.
There is stuff there.... J.D.F.: Mangled ideas in mad
handwriting... .F.L. (Croydon): No interest in it.
....Jimmy the R.: Not enough meat in your pie.
.. . .Gilbert M.: The lights are not bright enough. . .
Margaret: It isn’t worth while. .. .N.J.L.: Hard-
worked commonplaces without feeling or skid....
Bcllerive: It goes straight to the heart: —
Fondly Mother dear predicted,
When my gift was but a spark.
From a flicker ’twould flasheth.
Like a searchlight in the Dark.
A reverent and gentle Mother,
1 never knew a friend more kind;
Scripture lessons she would teach me
To enlighten my young mind.
As the years did rolleth onward,
When to trials my lot was cast,
Vividly her fond prediction
Echoed from the distant past.
....Willy Nilly: Old stuff poorly handled....
H.A.W.K.: Crude and childish... .Rene C.: Both
miss, though the gun was pointed the right way....

Very thin.... Lilia It.: Antique drawing-room ballads
worked all those phrases bald... .W.H.M.: “The
Little Church on the Hill” is not half so thrilling
as some little pubs in the valley... .1t.T.0.: The
play is unpleasant without being dramatic. .. .Victor
L.: Blatant and incredible melodrama.... A. B.B.:
Nothing in it but a few classical names... .M.H.S.:
No, thank you.... Una R.: Sonnets must be a lot
better than that... .Michael O.: Your rooster is not
half exciting... .E.J.5.0.: Sorry, the 15 years’ spell

.. . .W.W.A.: Only a miracle could make it worse.
.... J.H.H.: The method would have spoiled a better
idea... . Azrim: Sad little thing... .Molly R.: The
pen isn’t doing much... .Tom E.: You’ve a poor
idea of rhyme, and a worse of rhythm, and you don't
write as if you even wanted your stuff read....
H. : Very lame and as empty as a land-agent's
conscience... .Margot D.: There’s a hint of promise,
but they are very .young... .Malkah: What’s this?
—“the bills are peeling.” Potatoes or onions?....
El Dorado: Verse in favor of being tender to crows
doesn’t move us... .Iridis: One exquisite stanza: —
Victory and honors both ascend from a Power;
But the power comes from the sweet Will at rest;
What nourishes the Will like a fragrant flower
But ambition, belief, resolution all abreast ?
Nothing will free you from misfortune’s grin
If you don’t be “up” and resolve to win !
... .Lloma: It has all the magic of tender simplicity:
My Mother taught me modesty
When I was quite a boy;
And as I practised it for years,
I missed a lot of joy.
For I was always stiff and staid,
While others laughed and joked,
And often felt a jolly fool
When girls my tummy poked.
But now I’m old and know what’s what,
I know just what to do:
But when I tease the giriies now,
They toss their heads and “Pooh!”
~. .L.11.E.: Terrible verse.... Arrum: Doesn’t appeal
to us W.R.D.: That has been done very often
in better verse... .Marjorie K.: Walks woodenly,
though it has enough feet to spare to set a centi-
pede up in business.... Lochiel: Doesn’t get near
enough even to remark that it’s cold this morning.
. ...P.G. (Vic.): Nothing in it....Arma S.: Pretty
weak all round.... Jas. H.: If the first version was
worse, it was too bad to have any hope from resur-
rection. .. .Laurence O.: Very poor. .. .Factory Girl:
Misses, but there is enough in it to draw hope
from.. .. Billo C.: A hard-worked idea that has
swallowed gallons of ink Charles M.: One'might
do.. . .Wilson: No good of saying line for line the
obvious things that thousands have written.. ..
Rolling Stone: No originality and less force Ess
Kew: Bad parodies are among the saddest things in
life or death... .R.D.C.: You have an idea; see if
vou can’t do better with it....Meph: Fais....
0.C.T.: As you will see, we have asked an authority
to deal with the whole question.... H.W.: This •
much of it, anyway: —
O wonderful crietzsche called Nietzsche,
Apostle and prietzsche and tietzsche,
Go tell any German,
Your Fritzie or Herman,
Long, long have we rietzsche and bietzsche.
....Midas: Your secret murderer is so familiar, and
not worth the good clothes you’ve put on him....
I. : “Gipsy” deserves a little more elbow grease.
. . . .Caesar: Too many pens have travelled that track.
A pity, for there is some humor in yours.... Paw-
paw: You kill too many people. Can’t you do some-
thing with a superfluous character now and then
that won’t leave a bloodstain on every page?....
S. : Want affidavits with that.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
T.P.P.: Admirable example of vorticism. .. . 8.C.:
That joke has long been pensioned off. .. .R.G.: Your
horse is yelling for a vet Y.M.G.: You’ve a good
way to go yet....A.E.: Come out in the open with
your drawing—silhouette covers a multitude of sins.
...Q.S.: Drawing, even if passable, wouldn’t carry
the gag R.C.8.8.: Too amateurish... .E.K.: Still
below the mark H. 8.: Sails too close to a com-
paratively recent Bulletin joke H.W.T.: Another
miss... .W.D.M.: Not a winner among them

face again D. 8.: Drawing bad; may use one as

THE NEW BEALE PIANO
10 Rodong Hall
Kirribilli.
Dear Sirs,
It gives me much pleasure to
state how delighted I am ‘with the
Beale Baby Grand purchased from
you a few months ago.
The tone scale is wonderfully
rich and full, and the touch and ac-
tion are so finely balanced that the in-
strument would satisfy the demands
of the most exacting performer.
For tone, touch, finish and
fine •workmanship I consider it un-
equalled.
So satisfied am I with the in-
strument, that I wish you to immedi-
ately instal another in my city studio.
[Signed] E. Bennett North.

WHEN an emfnent musician chooses an instrument for his own personal use, he is guided in his
choice by a very definite set of factors. Unlike the average individual, who has not devoted half a
lifetime to the study of tone, its production, control and, in the case of a piano, the qualities which
make for durability, he has that knowledge which enables him to select the very best. The New Beale Piano
has been honoured by the patronage of many eminent pianists. Some of these have been artists who have
played it on the public platform. Others have chosen it for intimate use in their own home—the strongest
form of endorsement.
Mr. E. Bennett North is a talented English accompanist, who has appeared with some of the most famous of the present-
day celebrities, viz., Madame Clara'Butt, Madame Ada Crossley, Madame Daisy Kennedy, Madame Rosina Buckman,
Madame Elsa Stralia, Madame d’Alvarez, Mr. Maurice D’Oisley, Mr. Jean Gerardy, Dr. Brodsky, etc. He has played
practically every make of piano without discovering any that he values more than the New Beale. When he came to
Australia some months ago to take up permanent residence, he purchased a New Beale Home-Grand for his personal use,
and that he considers it a perfect medium for the expression of his art is evidenced by the letter which he recently wrote to
us and which is reproduced herewith.
The New Beale is made in several models, finished in genuine rosewood, walnut or mahogany not stained imitations.
It is available as a piano for manual use, as a player-piano and as a reproducer-piano. Those who have not manual dex-
terity equal to their intellectual understanding of music, will find an ideal complement in the New Beale Player-Piano.
It supplies all that untrained musicians need to fully express their musical ideals; tone, technique and interpretative
qualities. Sold on an extended payment plan that makes possession very easy. "Silent” pianos taken in part payment.

Business, Robbery, etc.
“Mel”: Queer tilings turned up in the
bales of cotton at the Wowan (C.Q.) ginnery
this season. Among them were baby slippers,
a boy’s trousers, an embarrassingly intimate
section of feminine attire and—six live re-
volver cartridges. It is now proposed that
anyone sending in such “cotton” shall be fined,
for they put not only the gins out of action
for hours, but also the workers.
“Pat Busliie”: There are other lines be-
sides the Tamworth-Barraba, mentioned by
“Allbutt” (B. 26/7/’2B), which might begin
to pay if the motor-train was used. One
is the Goulburn-Crookwell line. It is 36
miles long, in hilly country, but as the train
(a mixed) takes three hours to do the trip,
most people take the road, on which a motor-
service carried 8000 passengers in six months.
The railway, of course, showed a heavy loss.
“Pat Bushie”: “E.F.’s” racecourse punters
are not the only ones with the tomato-sauce
habit (B. 26/7/’2S). Several times in a
little refreshment-room at Wallsend
(N.S.W.) I have seen a miner order a pie
and take a swig from the sauce-bottle as an
appetiser. The same practice is common
enough in Dago saloons. Probably it helps
to spread disease, as these bottles are usually
re-filled from supplies of sauCe bought in
draught.
* * * *
“Jan-Os”: “Sucre” (B. 26/7/’23) com-
plains of being swindled in Sydney by re-
tailers’ scales. The fraud, if it was worked,
must have been recorded on the dial before
his eyes. The retailers’ weights and mea-
sures are under vigilant supervision. Be-
sides being subjected to frequent and un-
expected testing, scales must be re-stamped
every two years, principally, it would seem,
because it’s good for the revenue. Before me
are a set of counter scales which weighed
just as accurately before as alter a recent
jaunt to “Weights and Measures” at a cost
of £3 18s. Od. Every retailer is subject to
the same periodical experience.
* * * *
“F. Clinton”: “Ileredot’s” par. about the
danger that may lurk in castor-oil (B.
19/7/’2B) recalls that in Sydney a few
years ago a large number of horses belong-
ing to a carrier in Marrickville suddenly
sickened and died. The vets, discovered that
ricine poisoning was the cause. Further in-
vestigation showed that the chaff on which
the horses had been fed contained a number
of castor-oil beans. A vessel had picked up
a cargo of these beans in the East Indies,
and after discharging it loaded a mixed cargo
for Adelaide, where it took on board a ship-
ment of chaff for Sydney. Some of the bags
were damaged in transit, and sufficient of
the beans got into the chaff to make it a
very deadly fodder. Ricine, by the way, is
found in the husk, and not the shell and
kernel of the bean.
* * * *
“C. Coral”: If a world-wide demand is
arising for shark and its by-products, as a
recent Bulletin par. suggests, Northern
Australian waters should be able to supply
abundance of the raw material. At present
a limited business in shark-fins, oil, etc., is
done by the islanders, who dispose of what
they can to John Chinaman, and also get
a bit out of curio-hunters for the teeth and
backbone. Nothing is done with the meat.
There are other undeveloped possibilities,
too. Dugong oil, for instance, ought to have
an industry of its own at Thursday Island,
and there is also sabay oil, the product of
a fish which abounds at certain reefs, closely
resembling cod-liver oil. The giant clam-
shell is another thing waiting for some enter-
prising firm to turn its ivory-like substance
to profitable account.
* •* * *
“Sucre”: Bowen (N.Q.) shipped 958
quarter-cases of tomatoes to Sydney in a
recent week. The Northern Fruit Associa-
tion distributed them to the Sydney dealers
at an average of 7s. 9d. a case. City and
suburban Dago fruit-vendors are unloading
them to their customers at Is. a lb. (four
tomatoes average a weighed lb.). As a
case contains eight dozen, Antonio gets 245.
for it. The Bowen cocky pays a penny a
case handling charge at Bowen, freight to
Sydney, auctioneer’s commission, and takes
all risks. He is lucky if the net return is
six shillings. Merely another instance, of
course, of the curse of centralisation, with
Its high land values and rent charges. But
there’s a last straw which will break even
the strongest cocky camel’s back. The
weaker ones have had theirs broken long
eince.
PITY THE BUSINESS MAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Business men who do not enter politics excuse
themselves by saying that their hide is not thick
enough.” —Austin Chapman, M.P., at the annual
C.T.A. banquet.
He does not like the insults that an M.P. flings
At members of the other party in the House ;
He shudders when recalling all the shady things
And shabby causes that these “uncouth crooks”
espouse.
An upright business man, his hands begrimed or
clean, he
Detests a label suc-h as “Choc’late Mussolini.”
To go to church on Sunday ; Monday neighbors rob ;
To lie for money’s sake —to these he’s not averse.
Mutton he can corner to raise the price a bob,
And show no blushing cheek when press and public
curse.
Yet, much as he would like in politics to dabble,
His shrinking soul prevents him mixing with such
rabble.
His courage no one doubts in bold financial deals,
He’ll take a risk to get in at tile early door ;
He feels no qualm or fear when profits he conceals
Or seeks new means to beat the income-tax for
more.
But ask him not to face the innuendoes horrid
Of Anstey’s and of Scullin’s scathing wit and torrid.
His skin, he asks you to observe, is pink and infantile,
While he can be respected and a robber, too.
Unmask him, he’ll outpoint the ancient crocodile,
It’s thicker than the oldest rhino.’s at the Zoo.
But when his country calls, wliate’er his dispositions,
His hide’s not thick enough to stand these politicians!

Take
Wolfe’s Schnapps
Hot, with Lemon, at Bed-time!
This is a course of action that is definitely
commended by worthy medical opinion:—
To quote just one of many authorities —Dr. Sharp,
a well-known Auckland medico, and medical officer of
the s.s. Niagara’ at a time when influenza was raging
aboard, published the following statement during an in-
fluenza epidemic in N.Z.:—
“We must not forget that Alcohol is a powerful
Antiseptic. ... In my opinion an ounce and
a half of the Proper Spirit, first gargled, then swal-
lowed, and followed by a drink of water, is a very f
effective means of Reducing the Risk of Contagion.”
Wolfe’s Schnapps is certainly a “Proper Spirit.” Not only
is it an alcoholic beverage of the very Purest Type, possessing
antiseptic and preventive qualities in the case of influenza, but
it definitely increases resistance to Disease by promoting a better
state of Health through its meaically recognised action on the
kidneys.

“Coot”: “T.P.’s” reminiscences of unfor-
tunate names (B. 26/7/’23) recall an in-
stance in my own Melbourne experience. The
child’s surname was Scrase, and she was
christened Ada.
Hobart’s reputed oldest inhabitant, James
Honey, has turned into his 102nd lap, and
is still going strong. He came to the Speck
in the wild and woolly days of 1825, is one
of the last of the old military rank-and-file,
and includes among his varied experiences
two years spent at Norfolk Island.
“Mel”: There’s a family in the Dawson
Valley (C.Q.) that is a fairly representative
empire collection. The head is John Thomas
Haslam, a civil engineer, who has taken to
cotton-growing. He was born in England,
his wife in Scotland, two children in India,
one in East Africa, one in England and, the
other day, one in Queensland.
B. H. Corser, who was suspended in the
Q. Parliament at the instance of Theodore
the other day, is a son of E. B. C. Cursor,
M.11.R. Father and son used to be in the
State Legislature together. Corser, jun., was
a student at the Gatton Agricultural College,
and then took up land whereon he is now
carrying on some interesting prickly-pear
experiments with cpchiueal insects.
“Sucre”: I can give “Alex. Val” (B.
2/8/’23) another instance of a man who vowed
he would never ride in a Brisbane tramcar
after the 1912 strike —Mick Ivirwan. Theo-
dore’s Chairman of Committees. He trudged
daily from Red Hill to the House in fulfil-
ment of his vow—and as in his early days
Mick was a “snob” he knew the value of
leather. He still curses the trams —and uses
a motor-car.
When Peter Walsh, of Nowra, died the
other day the N.S.W. South Coast lost its old-
est shopkeeper. For over half-a-century he had
kept a general store, putting the profits into
payable property, mainly on the North Coast
the Mecca of so many of the old South
Coast hands. A lieutenant son went through
the war and had a shot for Parliament with
a Labor gun at the last elections and missed.
Dad was 88 when the shutters were put up.
“The Rumpus” : I join issue with Gilbert
Mant when he says (B. 5/7/’23) that Perth
and Fremantle are filled with young factory
lads from Britain looking for jobs and that
they cadge money in the streets. The youth-
ful immigrants soon come from the bush,
certainly, but they are rarely seen hanging
about, much less cadging. Either they get
such city jobs as are going, or bolt for the
Eastern States after W.A. has paid out its
borrowed money to transport them here.
“Silvo” : “Norbell’s” par. (B. 5/7/’23) re-
garding the fool queries of officialdom re-
minds me of a communication received by
my friend Waggle from someone in authority.
Waggle’s father had just died, leaving no
will, and the property was in the hands of
the Curator of- Intestate Estates for distri-
bution among the nearest kin. Before every-
thing was finalised my friend was presented
with a list of questions which he had to
answer and get attested by a J.P. The first
Avas: “How do you know the deceased was
your father?”
“C. Coral”: The respirator-diving outfit,
recently experimented with in Torres Strait,
which permits the pearl-seekers to go down
to a depth of over 40 fathoms with nothing
but the patent headgear and a weighted belt,
has already begun to take toll. The new
apparatus has not been favorably regarded
by the seaworkers, their two chief objec-
tions being greater risk from sharks and
coldness of the water. The man who went
out the other day was a Jap, an old hand,
paralysis getting him. Incidentally, this has
been a very bad season for divers generally,
and the skin-divers have been making numer-
ous complaints about the coldness of the
water.
“Mayorsnest”: Talk of another close con-
test for Melbourne’s mayoralty on the re-
tirement of Swanson has set some rate-
payers asking why Charles Atkins is to be
opposed. For the past year or two they
had understood he was to follow Swanson
by the usual amicable arrangement. Coun-
cillor Atkins is a citizen who has done
things. He started the movement for an
annual Australian Manufactures Day (which
expanded into a week) for displaying home-
made goods in shop-windows. He was the
first president of the Vic. Chamber of Manu-
facturers after it had become a Federal
quantity, and he was the one vigorous, grey-
haired civic dignitary in Australia who went
off to England and insisted on doing his bit
during the war. Atkins has always stood
for practical endeavor and commonsense.
His apparent desire to become Lord Mayor
is, therefore, unintelligible, but there may be
extenuating circumstances.
“Donald D.”: Before I came to Australia
I was connected with the distilling, rectify-
ing and compounding trade in England, and
shipped to South Africa and Australia thou-
sands of casks and cases of spirits. I was
present when these spirits were compounded.
Brandy was made from power-alcoliol. This
is a spirit distilled at 65 p.c. overproof from
the refuse of fruit and vegetable markets. It
Avas manufactured largely in Germany and
was sold at 63d. per gallon f.o.b. Hamburg
in quantities not less than 10 puncheons.
The flavor of brandy Avas introduced by
essential oils, the color by burnt sugar, and
the strength reduced to proof Avith distilled
water. No attempt Avas made to mature or
improve this brandy by age, as time could
not work a miracle. Gin was also made from
this alcohol by adding water and flavoring
wita oil of juniper, and sweetening was
added in the shape of capillaire. This power-
alcohol also entered into the manufacture of
“bulk” whiskies, as it would readily blend
Avith malt or grain spirit. Ginger brandy,
orange bitters and other liqueurs and cordials
owed their spirituous strength to the same
powerful agent. Large quantities of these
spirits and cordials are doubtless still, im-
ported into Australia, and the authorities,
although they have Pure Foods and Drugs
Acts, never attempt to deal with the matter.
Instead, they send around officers to test the
strength of spirits sold in bars, and imagine
they are doing their full public service. The
officers should take away sealed samples for
analysis, and if an offence had been com-
mitted the onus would rest on the hotel-
keeper to prove where he purchased the
liquor. The importer should then be dealt
with.

The Value of Time
If you have to rise at a given
hour and then make every min-
ute of your day count, you need
a good clock. One that you can
rely on to help you meet your
schedule.
You can depend upon a
Westclox for two things—accu-
rate time-telling and a prompt
call at the hour set.
All Westclox teach the value
of time. They count every min-
ute carefully and help you to
make every minute count.
They have to do this to earn
the right to wear the quality
mark, Westclox, on the dial and
tag.
Equal dependence can be
placed in a Westclox watch.

Ballad of Youth’s Delight.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OH, two are young and the world is
young—
Green with the Spring’s young green !
And life is a girdle of Laughter-flowers
With no sad leaf between.
He is a beggar with sea-deep eyes
And carolling feet that leap ;
And I am the woman with wild, wild hair
Whose sleep enthralls his sleep.
Dancing high on the emerald hills,
Tossing the sun-girl’s hair,
Stirring the night with our murmurings,
Climbing the day’s gold stair,
Over the echoing roads we go
From dear July to June,
Stealing songs from the wakening birds,
Tying a star to the moon.
Love lies warm on our cherishing lips
And Joy’s a dream in our eyes
To still the whisper of Sorrow’s song
That yearns to make us wise.
Ah, not for me is a prince’s bed
Or satin to soothe my sleep!
I love a beggar with sea-deep eyes
And carolling feet that leap.
And not for him is the moon-cold maid,
Or voices of wedding guests ;
He loves a woman with wild, wild hair
And eager, tremulous breasts.
Then sing, oh sing, you emerald hills!
And laugh, you clamorous sea!
For I am queen of all loveliness
And he is king o’ me!
Oh, two are young and the world is young—
Green with the Spring’s young green!
And life is a garland of Laughter-flowers
With no sad leaf between!

PAMELA TRAVERS.
The Balcony.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE was a moody, unsociable sort of
chap. None of the fellows knew
much about him. They had nothing
against him, you understand, but he never
seemed to have any use for a mate; and
after a while the other chaps got to agree-
ing with him. They all chiacked me when
they knew we were going out on a job to-
gether—told me not to let the gay life get
a hold on me and to beware of his winning
ways. I knew what they were driving at be-
fore we’d been together a week. I’m used
to quiet men; all dinkum bushmen are quiet.
Gumtrees are thoughtful things, and they
make the men who live among them thought-
ful, if you know what I mean. But this
cove was the limit. Never a word unless
you asked him a question that he couldn’t
answer with a grunt; then he’d glare at
you as if you’d asked him for a fiver. I
used to try to make him talk at first, just to
nark him; but I soon got sick of that and
left him alone. It didn’t worry me much.
The fellow who’d camped there before us
had left a shelf of books in the hut; and
give me a good book, and the less noise you
make the better I’m pleased. So we used
to sit there of nights like a couple of bush
sweethearts—never speak a word. But after
a while we got a wet spell. That meant
spending the days in the hut; and then I
began to notice that this cove was getting-
worse. It wasn’t only that he was quiet;
he was barmy. Of course, there’s nothing
in that; the best mate I ever had was as
mad as a snake. But this cove wasn’t mad
in the right way. I’d look up from my book
and find him staring at nothing with a nasty
look in his eyes. Then all of a sudden he’d
begin to shake—scared stiff of something.
He would jerk his body back quick; and
then he would come to himself and look
round in a frightened kind of way to see
if I’d spotted him. Of course, I’d have
my nose buried in a book, not letting on
i’d seen a thing; and he’d give a ereaky kind
of sigh and sit back with his eyes shut.
After a while they’d open and he’d go
all through the same game again; always
bringing up with that jerk. After a while
I noticed lie wasn’t sleeping. He began to
break up then ; and that rain never stopped.
I was about fed up myself, in spite of the
books. It’s the noise on the tin roof that
gets you. I’ve known big, healthy fellows
go off! their feed and get as jumpy as a
woman after a few days of it —jump up. per-
haps, with a yell and rush out to get wet
through. Anything to dodge those millions
of little devils hammering on the tin.
I woke up one night and found Curly sit-
ting before the fire. We called him that,
for I don’t think any of us knew his right
name; but he had a head like an egg. I
could see he was in the middle of one of his
bad spells. His face was set and looked as
if it’d be as cold as a stone if you touched
it. While I watched him his eyes grew
more and more wild ; and he put out his foot
suddenly as though he were going to stand
up. Then, as quick as a snake springing,
came that backward wrench—and with it a
yell. That brought me out of my bunk, I
can tell you. There he was shaking from
head to foot and the sweat was running off
his face. He looked at me with a sort of
pleading.
“I’m sorry, I m sorry, Ted! I’m afraid
I waked vou up—l’m sorry—must have been
having a'bad dream myself!”
He spilt the words out with a rush, like
you’d swish the tea-leaves out of your billy.
I knew he must be in a bad way. He hadn’t
spoken as many words as that in the three
weeks we’d been out together.
I went back to my bunk growling about
darned fools that sat. around having night-
mares instead of turning m like white men.
But he didn’t get up;.just sat there shaking
and breathing like a sick man. Presently he
turned his head my way, but didn’t look
at me.
“Are y’ asleep, Ted?”
“Hell of a chance I’ve got!” I growled.
He didn’t answer that; but by-and-bye he
asked another question.
“Ted, d’you know anything about haunted
houses?”
I saw I was in for it.
“No, but I know a heap about haunted
huts.” I was thinking of the sleep I knew
I wasn’t going to get.
He fidgeted on his seat for a while; then
he turned and faced me.
“But you believe in them —you know there
are haunted houses?”
I thought of the homestead at Bundagai
and the shearers’ hut at Maree, where
Timmy, the cook, hanged himself, and said
I supposed there was something in it.
"But, Ted” —he was shaking now worse
than ever —“this is what I want to know.
Did you ever hear of a house haunting a
man?”
I didn’t see what he was driving at, and
said so.
“Well, y’ see” —he was still spilling his
words out—“it seems to me that if a house
got a down on a man”
Then he gave in suddenly—chucked up the
whole defence, so to speak.
“I’ll tell you a bit of a yarn—a yarn about
myself, if you don’t mind, Ted.”
The man was broken —done in. He’d have
talked to a two-year-old kid if there’d been
no one else there.
“It was a big old house in a gully, with
hills all round it, and pretty lonely, too.
Anyhow, it seemed like that to us; we
weren’t used to the bush then. We answered
an ad., me and the missus, for a married
couple.”
It seemed queer to think of this mad, old
wreck with a wife—a wife, and perhaps a
family. I began to picture him with a fat
baby on his skinny knee and wanted to
laugh. You know the ratty way you do
when you’re feeling sorry and rotten at the
same time.
“She was an old maid, the woman who
owned it —lived all alone except for us. She
took a great fancy to the wife—used to have
her in with her all the time, sewing and
doing things. She got so as she couldn’t do
without us; but she was a mean old brute—
locked everything up: And she hated the
sound of whistling.”
For a minute he forgot everything except
the rage and hate that lit up his face as if
it’d caught fire.
“What do you think of that —what do you
think of a woman who’d go off at a man be-
cause he whistled about the place?”
Then his jim-jam got him again; I saw
him press his hands on his knees, trying to
keep them quiet.
“We’d been with her about five years when
she took sick, and the missus nursed her all
through. She wouldn’t have anyone else
near her. She was bad for months—it nearly
wore the missus out. When she was able
to get up she couldn’t do enough for us—
even began making a fuss over me, though
she hated men. ‘Your wife saved my life;
I will never forget it,’ she used to say to me
over and over. And she wasn’t far wrong
about that.”
I could hear the rain easing a bit on the
roof; it would be fine in the morning. That
meant a slogging day’s work —and me with
no sleep to speak of. But I knew it was no
use trying to stop him then, so I lit up.
“Then one day, when she’d been up for a
week or two, she called us both into her room
and told us she’d made her will.”
He stopped, and I began to monkey with
my pipe, letting on it wouldn’t draw. I knew
if I looked at him he’d break up altogether.
“She’d left the house and what bit of
money she had to us. I won’t say we hadn’t
expected some cash, after all we’d done for
her ; but the house was another story. She
was barmy over it, used to say that she loved
every stone of it, and every stone of it loved
her.”
His breath began to come in jerks again,
but he hurried on, as if he had something
pushing him.
“She’d lived in the place all her life; and
we knew she had meant to leave it to a
cousin, though she wasn’t friendly with any
of her folks. ‘But you won’t get it yet,’ she told
us, ‘not for years. I’ll live to be a hundred
—all our family does.’ Then she laughed. A
horrible, cackling laugh she had —her that
couldn’t bear the sound of a whistle.”
I got up and went over to the fire. The
yarn was getting on my nerves, and I wished
I hadn’t let him start—or that there was
someone else in the room with me to hear
what was coming next.
“She used to spend most of her time on a
balcony—a little fool of a thing outside her
bedroom. There was only room on it for her
chair and table ; and there she’d sit, looking
out over the gully. I showed her one day
where the white ants had got into the rail,
and she told me to fix it. I had to take part
of it out, and I was a day or two finding the
right bit of timber for the job.”
I could feel his eyes on me—feel the wild
fear and defiance in them. I got busy with
my pipe again, and in a minute he went on.
“Of course, she. had to sit out there just
the same —couldn’t wait till it was finished—
her with a whole houseful of rooms to sit in !”
His voice had gone cold, like his face—
cold and grumbling.
“The wife was working at the back of the
house when she heard a scream. We both got
round to the front at the same minute, and
found the old woman lying on the cement
path with her neck broken. Of course, it
was an accident —she must have turned giddy
and fallen.”
I looked up in time to see the lie turn and
twist in his eyes.

Winter Eczema, Cold
Chilblains and “Chaps”
Soothed and Healed by ZAM-BUK, the Great Herbal Balm.
Keen wintry weather brings a host of skin troubles. Cold Sores,
Chilblains, Chapped Hands, unsightly Face Sores and Blotches become a
source of discomfort and annoyance. To end these troubles and make your
skin healthy, clear and flexible, give the face, arms and hands a nightly
dressing with Zam-Buk.
This super-balm prepared solely from herbal oils and extracts is
so natural and so refined that it readily penetrates into the skin to the tissues
below. Zam-Buk instantly soothes the smarting irritation, it kills disease-
germs and quickly heals all soreness, roughness and chafing, which —if
neglected—often develops into Eczema or other chronic skin trouble. Further,
Zam-Buk grows new, healthy skin in an astonishing way.
No mineral ointment or fatty salves can com-
pare with Zam-Buk for dispelling skin troubles.
Whether your trouble be ordinary pimply
eruptions, sore chapped hands, chilblains, or a
more serious attack of eczema, ulcers, ringworm
or blood-poison, you can always depend upon
Zam-Buk. Zam-Buk s powerful antiseptic and
skin-growing properties make it the swift, perfect
healer for cuts, burns, etc. It is also the soothing
remedy for piles, and used as an embrocation
soon drives away soreness, muscular rheumatism,
neuralgia and other aches and pains.
Mr. John Prowse, Magpie Street, Ballarat
East, Victoria, says:—
“I was troubled with skin sores on my face for
about six months and nothing I tried offered any
relief. At last I applied for a sample of Zam-
Buk, as offered by you in our local paper, and I
am glad to say that after using Zam-Buk for
about a week the sores completely disappeared.
I can very gratefully testify to the healing power
of your wonderful remedy, and shall always
recommend it to anyone suffering from skin
troubles.”

out over the balcony.... I have to jerk
myself back”....
. I thought of the scores of times I’d seen
him do it and felt a bit sick. The sweat
was pouring from his face now, and his
eyes were horrible.
“What’s it mean, Ted —what’s it mean?
You re a bright young fellow. .. .what’s it
mean?
I shoved him into his bunk and gave him
a double-header whisky. I had one myself,
too, I don’t mind telling you.
The rain let up a bit in the morning, and
we got in a few hours’ work. Curly was as
dumb aS ever; but I could see that he was
different. It rained again after lunch, and
you can bet I didn’t go much on sitting in
the hut with him. It was all right at first.
I was supposed to be reading, and Curly
was fitting a new handle into the mattock';
but when that was finished he sat looking
into the fire. I noticed he seemed a good
bit older than when we came out to the
camp three weeks before. He had a
sort of beaten look, too, like a man
who’s lost his punch. All at once I saw
him go stiff and his face got that cold look.
I sat there waiting for the jerk, but it didn’t
come. He lifted his foot, like he did the
night before ; but instead of jerking back he
stood up. Then he took a step forward....
he flung up his arms and leaned back for a
second with his face working like a luna-
tic’s. I’m not likely to forget the horrible
yell he let out as lie fell —like the one that
brought me out of my bunk the night before,
but a hundred times worse.
I got him the 15 miles to the township
somehow, bundled up in rugs; but it was
no picnic. I can tell you. The river was
flooded and the mud was pretty near as bad
as Flanders.
The doc. went crook on me, too. The ’flu
was bad at the time, and he was narked at
being called up. He said any fool could see
that the man had been dead for hours.
MARGARET FANE.
The Key.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was partly because Minpson had given
me the electric torch to keep for him,
partly because Alice was in a bad tem-
per, and partly because a mosquito had
punched a hole in my lip that I went out to
see why the moonshine was so close and
oppressive. A mosquito bite on the lip is a
distressing circumstance —not exactly a. pain,
but. an irritation which works in the blood
like a recurring decimal, and is best relieved
by murder and dancing. Alice was also dis-
tressing, but more in the manner of a lost
collar-stud than a queen of tragedy ; and the
electric torch seemed the only comparatively
steady thing in a wilderness of sandy emo-
tions and jig-saw thoughts. I threw down
my book, rose from the uneasy depths of the
chair, flicked on the torch and went out.
I took my geological hammer with me and
moved towards the depths of the gully. To
tap out fossils by torchlight was better than
sitting indoors to have physical and moral
venom injected into my system. The electric
torch played curious tricks with the moon-
shine ; but when I reached the deep shade
where the water tinkled, its circle of light
glowed undisputed in the deep shade of over-
hanging wattle and oak. In the creek-bed
the rocks were mossed, but to right and left
they stood in rugged bare walls; and there
I found what I took to be the ginko. Why
the ginko was so far out of its geological
latitude I did not then pause to inquire;
but I was curious about the long purple rays
of semi-crystalline stone which seemed to
focus in the fossil. The task of chipping out
the treasure proved too much for me, and I
resolved to leave it until the morning, care-
fully marking the place.
And then I saw the key'. It was not as a
key. that I saw it first, but as a bright
metallic spot in the rock.
“Gold,” I thought. “By Pluto, I am in
luck to-night!”
Gold it surely was, but a nugget of a
very different nature from any I had ever
expected to hnu. As I tapped away the hard
quartz pebDles embedded in the sandstone I
saw the symbol of Jupiter—that ancient
mark which modern physicians frequently
put at the head of prescriptions even to-day.
idagerly I hammered at the rock until the
whole of the gold was revealed ; and then it
lay in my hand, two ounces of shining metal
in the form of a perfect key.
I Tat down on a rock and wondered ; and
as I wondered I felt that pricking of the cold
skin which I can readily diagnose as ancient
“hereditary superstition using its spur on
scientific man to stampede him into the camp
of the dabblers in the occult. But the key
was in my hand —a real key that had been
fashioned by human skill and yet buried in
the imck when the quartz-pebble sandstone
was in the making. The thought was mad-
ness. To give a date to the making of those
rocks it was necessary to go back millions of
years ; and the presence of the key made it
necessary to think of civilised man—-man
capable of making a key of gold—at that re-
mote period. And the sign of Jupiter was on
the handle. Clearly I had made a great dis-
covery, but it was an uncomfortable and dis-
turbing discovery which would make a lot of
other discoveries necessary in order to save
the sanity of science. A discovery that goes
too far is only an order to get busy and
work : a nice little discovery that leads you
one clear step has only to be mounted in a
suitable frame and shown to the daily news-
papers. I put the key in my. pocket and
meant to say no more about it until I had
lots of time.
Suddenly the gully began to feel unwhole-
some. There were sure to be snakes there ;
and many snakes, as everybody who is afraid
of them knows, crawl about at night in moist
places. They do this to get a drink and
catch frogs; but it is best not to speak to
them. I climbed up the steep slope and stood
in the moonlight. The larnpshine from my
own home glimmered bravely through a patch
of shadow, but the ridge was open to the
moon—a ridge rocky and broken where walls
of sandstone rose like rude steps to the fringe
of dead trees. On one of these walls 1
allowed the light of the electric torch to fall
while I searched for indications of fossil
shell or bone. A large piece of rock, broken
from the surrounding mass, was almost ready
to fall. I noted the straight lines of its
cleavage and the portion of a burnt tree
whose growth had caused the split. I
climbed up behind the stump, and using it as
a lever sent the big square mass rolling to-
wards the gully. It was an easy thing to do;
and the dull crash and thud of its fall seemed
loud in the quiet night. A fresh wall of
sandstone was revealed, and over this I
flashed my torch.
At this point the most credulous reader
may cease to believe what I write. It is
quite natural that he should do so; I should
absolutely refuse to credit it myself if an-
other person had beeii the witness of a thing
so strange. The split rock showed a door of
mottled green stone—probably jasper—and
m the door was a lock!
Like a man in a dream I fitted the golden
key I had found to the keyhole. The lock
half yielded to my pressure ; and I knew that
only a little oil was needed to make it turn
altogether and open the door of mystery,
Almost too dazed to wonder I rushed home
m the moonlight. I scarcely noticed that
Alice had gone to bed nor resented the fact
that the cat was asleep on a pile of manu-
script on my < table. Alice has a sewing-
machine, and in a drawer of the machine is
an oil-can. It is one of those narrow, taper-
ing things designed to be sticky on the out-
side and unpleasant to the touch, but gener-
ally effective in placing oil where you do
not want it to go.
I snatched up the oil-can and sprinted
• back m the moonlight to the green
•door in the rock. I clicked the bottom of
the tin and made oil run into the keyhole ;
then I oiled the key and inserted it. To the
pressure of my fingers the mechanism with-
m yielded ; the bolt snapped back.
Suddenly, as I stood there in the moon-
light, the significance of the ivhole thing
flashed upon me. I had found a fossil key
which opened a fossil door. I had evidence
of the existence of a human-civilisation mil-
lions of years before the Pyramids—a civili-
sation that used the sign of Jupiter and
fashioned modern locks. The door to a
treasure house of that infinitely remote past
was unbarred at my touch ; I had but to
pull it open and the great secret of the ages
was mine. What wonder of ancient life lay
within? What key was there to the mystery
of death?
I knew that all the tombs of Luxor, all the
secrets of the Pyramids, must be very small
things compared with this find of iny own.
It would revolutionise archaeology, shake the
foundations of science, make history a mere
flippancy and modern politics a game jf
greedy children. I was at a source of power
greater than all the electric energy of
Niagara; Buddha and Mahomet had made
no such contribution to religion as I was
about to make.
I thought I heard something move within
the rock. Instantly my thought ran, in other
channels. What power of life-in-death might
these mighty ancients not still possess'? I
had laughed at a modern writer who said
that ancient magic might yet be modern
science; but I could not laugh by that green
door in that thin glistening moonlight. In
opening the vault of the past I was about to
do the greatest thing done by modern man.
At tnat thought I moved back two paces
from the door. Then I remembered Alice,
the people in George-street, the smell of
apples, the taste of the surf, the hook I was
reading, a line from Keats, the fact that my
boots needed mending, and about twenty
thousand other matters. It is always so in
times of great moral stress or mental crisis,
Memory and emotion surged about me like a
tide. Instantly my resolution was formed.
I stepped forward to the green door, turned
the key, saw that it was locked and walked
away to the highest point of the rocks,
Standing there in the moonlight, I threw the
key high into the air. I saw it describe a
bright circle and flash as it turned, but I did
not hear it fall. A great silence was all
about me as I walked softly home—a silence
that seemed to carry as an undertone some
strange hymn of thanksgiving,
A clock chimed as I entered the house. The
cat rose and yawned ; I yawned and crept
to bed. Over and over in my head sang a
remembered line—‘‘lf the great future be
the little past.” If—and why not"? A ray
of moonlight found its way past the edge
of the blind and fell slantwise on the dressing-
table. Alice had left her ring there and It
answered the moonlight in darting fires of
blue flame. If the future and the past—-the
blue flame darted higher—-were mixed in that
way, there should be fossils of the future iu
the oldest rocks.
“The fossil key,” I murmured, “the key
of to-morrow in the rocks of yesterday.”
I shook my sleepy head and my gaze fell
on the diamond in the moonlight—the dia-
mond, that mystery of crystallised eai'bon
that all heat and pressure failed to produce
save in the most microscopic flakes/ by
mechanical means. Then I Sat up suddenly.
“Alice,” I cried. “The diamond' is the
fossil of the future found where it meets the
past.”
“\Y ha—what’s that'?”
T had to tell her the story of the key.
“NoW go to sleep.... and dream some
more,”.
“Rut the diamond, Alice. The fossils of
the past are worms find molluscs add huge
reptiles; the fossil of the future ifc flame of
concentrated light, It is found where the
past and future meet in the eternal cycle.”
“Oil the dressing-table,” she murmured
softly.
„ 1 retired hurt before lier even breathing,
She was fast asleep.
A> u t the diamond still flamed; and, looking
it, a word from an ancient writer flashed
into my mind—“ The diamond is the wife of
the sun.”
“The eternal feminine,” I muttered, “....
the woman element in fossil.... the future
....the female.... hard.... bright... .ex-
pensive.... unchanging.... incomprehensible
....in a circle.... always Alice the
key... .daren’t turn ”
