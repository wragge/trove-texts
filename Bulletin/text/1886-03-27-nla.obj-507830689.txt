SATURDAY, MARCH 27, 1886.
Ttiti attendance of participants at the St.
Patrick’s Day banquet on Thursday last in
Sydney, contrasted strikingly with the
assemblages for an identical celebration just
three years ago. This year the guests com-
prised a large contingent of the class which
it is customary to allude to in the daily
newspapers as “distinguished,” “leading,”
“influential,” and “representative.” The
gathering was “ brilliant,” the proceedings
“dignified” and “harmonious,” the whole
affair was “creditable.” In all these
respects it offered a striking contrast to the
banquet of 1883, Then, “ distinguished,”
“leading,” “influential,” and “representat-
ive” men were prominently absent: the
assemblage was mainly of “obscure” per-
sons, one “public man” who had outraged
the proprieties by countenancing the affair,
was overtaken With liquor and his condition

tunity for demoting columns of space to his
misdeeds, and for stating that this was just
What might have been expected under the
Circumstances.

If one searches for a concrete definition of
the fundamental difference between the
two celebrations, it will be found in this —
That the banquet of Thursday last was
Utterly without significance; whereas, the
banquet of 1883 was fraught with strong
and definite portent. Hence, follows the
Strange inference that the “distinguished”
gathering on the recent occasion was of in-
significant persons, whereas the assemblage
of “nobodies” on the earlier celebration
was one of significant persons. Despite the
singularity of that distinction, we believe it
to be abs olutely correct. By recalling the
- history of the St. Patrick’s Day of 1883, and
of the period immediately preceding that
anniversary, we expect to be able to convey
our belief In this matter pretty clearly to
our‘‘readers, A very short time prior to St.
Patrick’s Day, 1883, Mr. J. E. Redmond,
M.P., had arrived in Sydney as an accredited
, emissary from Mr. Parnell and the Irish
1 Land League. He was accompanied by his
\ brother William Redmond, now also a
i member of the House of Commons. These
i two gentlemen were entrusted with the
■ duty of obtaining subscriptions in support of
i the League, and their method was by visiting
rail centres of population, and delivering
'lectures explanatory of the objects and
methods of the league. But immediately
iprior to their landing in New South Wales,
Intelligence had been received by cable of
the assassination of Lord Fredk. Caven-
dish and Mr. Burke, in the Phoeaix Park,
at Dublin. The cable intelligence, proceed-
ing, as it always has done, from agencies
and establishments which are the mouth-
pieces of the London capitalist and
stock-jobbing classes, was a selection of
the most sensational suppositions and
icanards with which the air of the English
metropolis was quivering at the time. The
of the crime was ascribed to
the Land League. Intentions to arrest Mr.
jParnell and other prominent Parliamen-
tary leaders of the Irish were wired out.
The proud silence which these leaders
-opposed to the hysterical cries which
assailed them from every side was alleged
to be equivalent to a confession of guilt.
Such was the tenor and tone of the cable
advioes published daily by the papers—re-
: fleeting faithfully enough the wild-
est ravingfl of the capitalist organs of
London, but without the qualification
1 furnished by the extracts from Irish
Nationalist papers which were available to
English readers—that the arrest of the
Irish Parliamentary leaders, on aprima facie
demonstration of their connection with the
“Invincibles” was expected in Australia
every hour. The daily newspapers here also,
without exception, lost their heads, and their
ravings so aggravated the alreadysufflciently
exaggerated false colouring of the cabled
items, that the reading public was carried
away almost in a body. It was almost im-
possible for any man, unless he were either
an Irishman who truly loved his native
country, or a Briton just as firmly devoted
to the cause of truth and justice without
distinction of races and creeds, to keep a
balanced mind. Among all the newspapers
of Australia The Bulletin stood, we be-
lieve, alone in stemming the flood of excite-

rnent and the torrent of false inferences. It
was at that time that we wrote as follows,
and we quote with some pride an utterance
which it then required the courage of our
convictions to publish, which imperilled the
popularity and fortunes of our paper, and
which subsequent events have so thoroughly
justified
“ These considerations are ample to impress any
fair man with the propriety of at least suspend-
ing .1 idgment respecting the responsibility of the
Land League leaders. But tluir drift is amply
corroborated by antecedent facts. It is incontro-
vertible that these leaders did from the formation
of the league publicly d3nounce violence of all
kind. This may have been a blind, but that sup-
position is not endorsed by facts. It is true, that
until these leaders were imprisoned and their
organisation suppressed, crime and outrage were
at a minimum, and that the suppression of their in-
fluence was followed by overwhelming evidence
that thdr power had been used to restrain, inas-
much as murder stalked through their unhappy
country from the day they were no longer able to
exercise control. It is true that they had no sooner
come to an understanding with Mr. Gladstone’s
Government, and prepared to inaugurate a system
of mutual concessions and conciliations, than
their pirns were shattered by these assassinations.
It is true that they instantly denounced and
lamented the occurrence, and not only offered re-
wards for the discovery of the assassins, but, in
moving terms, arraigned them ss the worst ene-
mies their country had yet suffered from. Surely
no newspaper reader can have so soon forgotten
that in almost every quarter-certainly in every
unprejudiced quarter-the view was unhesitat-
ingly adopted, that there existed a party of Irre-
Goncileable?, bitterly hostile to the moderate
counsels of Mr. Parnell and his associates, who
had chosen the desperate but effectual means to
frustrate his designs, and to make reconciliation
between the Biitish Parliament and the Irish
people impossible. It cannot surely be forgotten,
that there were current as many rumours of Mr,
Parnell s life being threatened by the desperate
section, as there were of Mr. Forster’s danger.
When these points are duly weighed and deli-
berately pondered, reasonable people will per_
ceive that they would he untrue to their man-
hood, were they to permit themselves to be hur-
ried to premature conclusions by the misrepre-
sentations of professing counsellors, who have
shown that they can neither control their tempers
nor manage their reasoning faculties when their
prejudices are roused.”
Mr. J. E. Redmond, M.P., was, when that
was published, already in Sydney. He had
been denied the hospitalities ordinarily ex-
tended to gentlemen of his birth and posi-
tion. He had delivered a first address or
lecture, bravely and logically expounding
and defining the principles and objects of
the Irish Parliamentary Party and of the
Land League. This address had been elo-
quent in manner and deliberate and mea-
sured as to its matter. But it had been
metaphorically hooted down by the daily
Press, the Sydney Morning Herald espe-*
oially distinguishing itself by attributing to
the lecturer the passions which its own
columns betrayed to be agitating its own
conductors. It charged Mr. RedMond with
being “saturated with passion and exagge-
ration” and “hot with human hate.” A
more accurate definition of the condition of
the Herald’s own mind, aud of the inflam-
mation to which it and the other dailies had
wrought up the unthinking among colonists
need not be desired. It seemed more than
any public journal’s circulation was worth
to publish words of reason at this epoch,
such as The Bulletin poured out issue
after issue. It seemed more than a public
man’s position was worth to openly counte-
nance Mr. Redmond.
* * *
And here we come to the pith of the
matter. When the young Irish patriot
stood on the platform to deliver his lecture,
he stood almost unsupported. Of all the
members of our Legislature who had crawled
into place by pretences of devotion to “the
dear Green Isle,” not one was shoulder to
shoulder with this combatant in the hour
of stress and trial. Men who had never
failed to distinguish themselves by their
prominence on every stage where meek
patriotism had to be acted, were conspicu-
ous by their absence, now vhen their
presence would have been of real value, but
would have involved them in sacrifices and
perils. Those maggots which writhe and
revel in the corruption of complimentary
banquets to humbugs, and which emerge
as butterflies to flutter vainly when
the sun shines, had grovelled deep
down into the earth and were in semis-
torpid terror, quivering with apprehension,
lest they should be dug up and forced to
exhibit. Those well-known varieties—the
picnic-bug and the banquet blow-flies—
were securely sheltered in some obscure
crack or crevice. One Irish member of our
Legislature indeed was in the vicinity of
the platform. Mr. Redmond apostrophised
him and described his situation to the at-
tentive multitude as “ skulking behind the
curtain.” The skulker thus indicated did
not emerge. He did not step forward either
then, or so long as Mr. Redmond remained
in Australia, publicly to announce that his
situation had been misapprehended, and
that he was ever willing, nay feverishly
anxious, to lay down his—well, his seat in
Parliament, for the cause. And when St.
Patrick’s Day, shortly following, arrived,
and Mr. Redmond was invited by its pro-
moters, the seats at that banquet were
occupied and unoccupied very nearly in
keeping with the chairs on the platform at
Mr. Redmond’s meeting.
* ♦ ♦
At that banquet there was no eloquent
Dalley to pour forth a limpid stream of
meaningless elegancies. The Ministry was
not there represented by several members
to blather the average commonplace of
post-prandial declamation. Members of
Parliament were few and mostly shrinking
into their boots. There was no place on
that occasion for blather-skites and wind-
bags. It was, in a small way, an hour of
trial and of action, and as will surely happen
again should such an hour strike for this

community, the babblers and impostors—
the men who live by their country as distin-
guished from the men who live for it and
would die for it—had shrunk out of sight,
and had been replaced by the men in
earnest, the men of principle, the men of
action. Henry Copeland was there. He
went thither despite the remonstrances
and threatenings of his colleagues. He
took his portfolio in his hand, and, alas!
instead of losing it nobly, a personal weak-
ness of a moment operated to make him
lose it in shame. But his shame was nobility
when contrasted with the deliberate and
natural depravity and meanness of the
mock Liberals who kept away owing
to self-interest, and the cheers which made
the walls resound on Thursday last when he
arose again in the same place testified that
his manly courage was not forgotten while
his social slip was more than condoned.
These cheers had a hearty ring in them very
different from the conventional applause
which greeted the hollow oratory of
the fair-weather politicians who sought
prominence on this safe occasion. And J.
G. O’Connor was prominent on both occa-
sions, and must have enjoyed the honours
which were paid to him with a whole
heart. But the maggots—their petty
souls must have wriggled in pain and shame,
as they rose to mouth their vapid unmean-
ing sentences, with the certain conscious-
ness that to every thoughtful person who
heard them, their very presence and pro-
minence was a revelation of the fickleness
of their disposition, and the spuriousness of
their mock heroics.
* * ♦
Lovers of liberty may feel the comfor-
table assurance that the just claims of the
Irish people are now near to being satisfied.
The indications are apparent. The very
claims which but three years ago Mr. Red-
mond was howled at by all the mock-
loyalists and Tories of New South Wales for
demonstrating, are now adopted by Mr.
Gladstone and his adherents. These claims
and these arguments, then foamed at as
disloyal and scandalous and not-to-be-
listened-to, are to-day soberly adopted as
mere matters of universal acceptability
The very men who were hissed at as deserv-
jng of the hangman's attentions, have
brought their ideas almost to the point of
realisation. Parnell and Redmond stand
on the same platform with Gladstone and
Granville, not because Parnell and
Redmond have recanted, but because
the Liberals of Great Britain have
been, by their courage, persistency, and
address, forced to recognise the soundness
of their arguments and the justice of their
cause. But the surest indication is this
creeping out of vermin to share the beams
of favouring fortune which shine on the
prospects of justice for Ireland. Yet let
Australians, who love liberty for her own
dear sake—who care not whether the appli-
cation be to Ireland or Poland, Egypt or
Arabia—take heed. Let but a cloud again
obscure the sun. Let the cause of liberty in
relation to Irish or Fellahs, to Russian serf
or Polish patriot, become but once more
unfashionable and fraught with social dis-
advantage and political risk, and the mag-
got-brood will crawl back once more to the
rotten and [corrupt warmth of more com-
fortable situations.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Power to declare War.
TBe motion in the House of Commons by Mr,
RICHARD, member for Merthyr Tydvil, “ That war
Shall not be declared, or a treaty concluded with
any foreign power, nor territory be annexed by
the British Government without the sanction of
Parliament was, according to cabled advices, re.
jected by a inajority of sIY votes only. It is a
pity that the nutnbets of votes for and against
had not been telegraphed. A majority of six
Yotes may signify much or little, according as
it represented the balance of opinion in a full
Bouse, or in a small division. Mr. Richard is,
if we recollect aright, one of those members of
Parliament who are regarded as “ faddists ”—a
designation which is applied equally to persons
who advocate impracticable whims, and to earnest
men who concentrate their minds and efforts upon
the realisation of some progressive measure, the
utility and value of which their generation is not
prepared to recognise. The members of the Peace
Society—a body which exerts itself to bring about
the Divine “fad” of “Peace on earth, good will
towards men ’’—are reckoned as “faddists ” of the
most ludicrous sort, and Mr. Richard is, we
think, a prominent member of that society. It is
probable, therefore, that his motion would be
treated superciliously, and just sufficient mem-
bers kept in attendance to defeat the votes likely
to be secured for the motion. Intrinsically, how-
ever, the purport of the motion is extremely
momentous. It is an attack upon the Constitution,
In the direction of stripping the Sovereign of the
most important among the few personal attributes
of power now remaining to the occupant of the
Throne. In practice this power of declaring war,
concluding peace, or entering upon treaties,
has never been exercised by the Sovereign
of his or her own motion since the Revolu-
tion. The Cabinet for the time being has
in this, as in other respects, assumed sovereign
functions. But the power is none the less personal
and capable of destructive abuse. It remains
always a menace to the prosperity and repose to
the nation, and is liable to being employed at any
time for the suppression of the growth of liberty
In other countries. Thus, for Instance, at the out-
set of the first French Revolution, the peoples of
almost every European nation were In fullest
sympathy with the people of Franca. But the
right of peace and war being in the hards of their
sovereigns, they were Impotent to prevent the
monarchical coalition which aimed at the sup- I
preasion of national aspirations in France. And, j
once at war, the spirit of combat is easily aroused
and kept glowing. It is in that last characteristic
that the mischief lies. We have had an example
of it in our own experience. It was this sovereign
authority to which Mr. D alley, a nominee mem-
ber of a non-representative Chamber had the In-
solence to usurp when he plunged New South
Wales into a war with which the colony tad no
concern, and which was waged in violation of
every principle due to men of liberal and human
ideas. Once the first step was taken'there was no
chance of retirement. Excitement seized, as it
always does in such cases, the thoughtless and
reckless. The air resounded with martial clamours,
and he who counselled reflection, and dwelt upon
the principles outraged was liable to be howled
down as a compound of coward and traitor. But
when there is preliminary deliberation—when the
community is pledged to nothing and opportunity
given of weighing the propriety, wisdom,
and justice—with the contrary of a step
so serious, all the inflammatory symptoms
are reduced in intensity. Had the people
of Great Britain been duly represented*
and the right of peace or war vested in
Parliament when the French threw off their
tyrannical form of Government, it is al-
most certain that England would have
had no place in the coalition against
France; and had the people of the continental
states been similarly potent, there would have
been in all likelihood no coalition at all. The
French Committee of Public Safety would never
have been forced into existence, there would have
been no Reign of Terror, and Europe would have
been spared the thirty years' wars of the Directory
and of the Emp’re. Casuists have urged that by
investing the Sovereign with the right of declar-
ing war, &c., a nation is benefltted. The advan-
tages of promptitude, of deceit ever are thus
secured. This argument is worth something. If
it could be shown that ultimate victory Invariably,
or even generally, has been secured by the nation
which started a war with the preliminary advan-
tage on its side of surprise, It would be difficult to
reply directly to that contention. But history
has so convincingly shown that the spirit and
resolution of a people constantly wrest victory
from defeat, that this argument Is worth little.
It is tolerably sure, that it will not be very
long before the people of Great Britain will insist
upon carrying into effect the little resolution
which has been for the moment delayed by a
majority of six.

A D scrinxinating 'Whip.
The London correspondent of the Sydney Even-
ing News announces that, strange as it may
appear, it is regarded as a distinction for a mem-
ber of the House of Commons to be selected by the
Whip of his party to interrupt a speaker on the
other side. This is introductory to a statement
that Mr. J. Henniker Heaton, M.P., has been
so selected, and did, in fact, interrupt the Hon.
Joseph Chamberlain in the House, “ So that,”
writes this hireling correspondent, “ Mr. Heaton’s
debut must be considered quite a success 1” We
conceive that there is a confusion of ideas here.
The correspondent has not recognised the differ-
ence between “ a distinction ” and “ an honour.’*
There are various subtle variations in the sense
which may be attached to the word “distinction
a man may be distinguished by grand or by mean
qualities. The idea conveyed to most people by
the incident re’ated by this literary valet of Hen-
niker Heaton s, will probably be that at last
the Conservatives are beginning to comprehend
the quality of his aptitudes, and that they select
him as a fit and ready tool for dirty work. Con-
ceive the shame and rage of an English gentle,
man at being invited to commence his Parliamen-
tary career, by an act of insolence and ill-breeding ;
We should look forward with interest to the de-
velopment of Mr. Heaton’s usefulness. We ex.
pect soon to be told that he has been further dis.
tinguished by being selected to crow like a cock
in the middle of one of Mr. Gladstone’s speeches
or to bray like an ass in reply.
Piety and Clarendon Stuartism
Sect arian bigotry has not yet died out in Aus
tralia— Clarendon Stuart is still alive. He took
it upon himself last week to write to the Sydney
Daily Telegraph for the purpose of showing
that “ insinuating a Presbyterian minister into a
Church of England pulpit Is ... to us church-
men a very important affair indeed,” and closed
his attack by grandiloquently remarking that
“ the Church of England has nothing to gain but
everything to lose by contact with Dissent.” We
do not intend to discuss hero any question of
" apostolic succession” or other dogma, or to de-
cide whether the Presbyterian Church is, to use
the exquisitely charitable words of Clarendon
Stuart, “ the most bitterly schismatical body that
can be conceived,” we merely wish to express our
doubt whether the religion of Jesus Christ could
by any possibility include any of the haughty,
snarling, grasping sects of modern alleged Chris-
tendom—in fact, we very much doubt whether He
would not be rejected by the sects on account of
his lamentable unsoundnesi of doctriae. And
here we come to the core of the trouble. The
essence of modern sectarian religion is doctrine
Each Church holds out a salvation programme,
promises everlasting happiness to all who sign P,
and threatens eternal destruction to all who be-
lieve in any contrary tenets. This fact is some-
times feebly denied, but the proof is clear. If
these dogmas are not necessary to salvation why
are there any sects at a’l? If the future can
be provided for by holding other doctrines,
why insist on these? The justification of
the existence of any church is the absolute
necessity of adherence to its dogmas, a
necessity usually stated in the most harsh and
uncompromising fashion. The Church of Eng-
land, for Instance, flourishes her Athanasian
creed, (written three centuries after the death of
its reputed author,) as a caution to her adherents
and a condemnation to the rest of the world.
This interesting document begins thus: “Whoso-
ever will be saved, before all things it is necessary
that he hold the Catholic faith and proceeds to
describe that faith with all the casuistical mystery
which marks the age in which it was written. Its
terms are beyond ordinary comprehension, but
that is not our present point, which is, the clear
deduction that faith in its doctrines alone, is the
means of salvation, and the declaration that all
who disbelieve, without doubt, shall perish
everlastingly. No wonder that a church
founded on such a creed has produced
Clarendon Stuarts in all ages. When sanctity
is thus made to depend upon a man’s ability to
split doctrinal hairs, he is the truest churchman
who displays the greatest precision in religious
casuistry, and who most fervently follows his
doctrines by, like them, consigning to eternal
damnation all who dare to think otherwise.
Clarendon Stuart (who was, we think, once at
Gympie, N.Q.) rightly prides himself on being a
churchman: he is, judging from his letter, about
as good a specimen of the result of the study and
practice of church doctrines as it would be pos-
sible to find. It is usually alleged in defence of
church tenets that they are founded on Scripture:
to was slavery, so is polygamy, as well as all
the numberless and conflicting faiths of all
the creeds of Christendom. The best proof
of the error of modern church teaching is
found by observation of its results. He*
whom all the churches boast as their founder*
Inveighed against the accumulators of riches in
the most uncompromising terms, and depicted
Dives who was cast into endless torment, not be-
cause of any actual breach of the commandments,
but, simply as far as can be seen, because he
heaped up riches for himself .and left the beggar
unheeded at his gate—the churches on the con"
trary hold up the rich man as a model for imita-
tion, and the result of such teaching is, that in
our day the rich are richer and the poor poorer
than ever they have been before. Again, Christ
preached unbounded charity and love—the Chris-
tian world to-day is more sordid and severe than
the majority of communities where the Testament
is never heard of. Worldly enlightenment is
working to improve our social state, and in every
direction its efforts are opposed, not by the Gos-
pel, but by the paid interpreters of it. The dry
stumps cf doctrine are valued and cherished by
our Church systems, while the fair trees of
love, charity, and mercy, drop their leaves be-
cause that cire which they require is denied
them. When the Saviour of the world appeared
he found three sects wasting their strength in
disputing over points of doctrine and neglecting
the real spirit of religion. If He were to come to-
day he would find 40 similar ones, wrangling over
the barren stones of doctrine, forgetful of the
golden virtues which are the very life of religion.
The Pharisees and the Sadducees have their
successors in the churches of this generation.
All Bible-readers detest the errors of those
ancient sects, but only very rarely can they be
made to see, that the crimes of those sects are the
daily practice of our own.
Mr. Abigail haa written to the Colonial Secretary
of New South Wales demanding that as Mr. Gab-
van, Minister of Justice, and Messrs. Toohey,
O'Sullivan, and Hogan, Ms.P., were at the
Hibernian banquet when the call for cheers for
the Queen was met with a few groans as well as
cheers, the police should enquire into the
matter, and closes his letter with the fearful
threat of taking other steps when Parliament
meets. It is really very unfortunate for Mr. Abi-
gail that the 9th clause of the infamous Martin
Treason Felony Act is now obsolete, for under it
he could have sent the irreverent groaners up for
two years each—a proceeding that would, doubt-
less, bring immense gratification to the little soul
of the leather-selling loyalist. It may be some
solace to Mr. Abigail to know that the groans
were not meant for Her Majesty, but as a protest
against the intrusion of her name at so mal-
aproposa period. If some person calls for cheers
for James 11. at the next Orange celebration we
shall not wonder if Mr. Abigail Is the first to in-
timate, by a suggestive groan, that the mention of
such a name at such a time is an unpardonable in-
trusion. Some persons cannot be loyal without
making their loyality offensive. Mr. Abigail
fills the bill In this respect so does the man who
caused the tumult at Botany. In olden times
when a man became religious he seemed to think
it Heaven-sent duty to go and kill somebody of a
different faith. It is much the same with loyalty
now. When it catches on to narrow-minded men,
it forces them to go and insult others who have
not got it so badly. They generally manage the
insult part of the business by joining Orange
lodges, or by calling for cheers for the Queen when
men are shouting themselves hoarse by cheering
Parnell, Redmond, and Davitt.
That clause in the Victorian Shops and Factories
Act which compels the closing of most shops at 7
o’clock in the evening on five days in the week
and 10 o’clock on Saturdays, is provoking bitter
wails from the Conservative Press. The Argus.
of course, leads the claque against what it is
pleased to call “ interference with the liberty of
the subject,” The arguments advanced by this
almighty champion of “liberty” are too puerile
to be amusing. Here is a specimen;—“lt is well
to restate the wholesome principle that Parlia-
ment has no more right to te’l men and women
when they are to buy goods, than it haa to tell
them what coloured clothes to wear or what
church to go to.” And this sort of stuff appears
in a paper which favours the strictest Sunday
observance-under Parliamentary compulsion.
But, as a matter of fact, the new Act doesn’t tell
the public when they are to buy goods—it merely
tells a small section of grasping shop-keepers when
they are to release their fagged-out assistants. If,
as some of the small fry complain, they can’t get a
living except by keeping open late, it were for the
physical benefit of the community that they
should follow some other occupation. The Argus
has nothing to say about the large drapers in Mel-
bourne’s busiest street who close at 6 o’clock or-
dinarlly'and give the Saturday half-holiday. As
far as they are concerned the new Act is one to
prevent their neighbours in the same line from
getting more than 13 hours’ “ pull ” over them per
week. But any restriction of the sacred rights of
capital is hateful to the autocrat’c Argus, and
this Shops’ Act being an “ interference with the
slavery of the subject ” who is not a capitalist is-
m the words of the twopenny oracle—“ an instru-
ment of wrong and oppression.”

The artistic world was divided on the question
and by a large section Mr. Belt continued to ho,'
regarded with suspicion. Recently the actual
character of Belt has been fully demonstrated hi

Belt’s scheme had an element of romance In it
He offered from time to time to Sir W. N. Abdv
Bart., fine diamonds, and persuaded the baronet
that he was getting the gems cheap, under excen
tionai circumstances. They were, Belt said the
property of a Mrs. Bolton, or some such name a
lady who had been an inmate of the Sultan’s
harem, and had received the jewels from her 1m!
perial keeper. The vista thus opened is a
singular one. That the Sultan’s harem
periodically replenished with lovely English
women, is pretty well known in certain circles'
In fact there is scarcely an Oriental potentate who'
does not keep a stock of pretty English girls
That the difficulties in obtaining recruits for the
langours and Allies of the harems of wealthy
Orientals need not be Insuperable is amply estab-
lished by the disclosures effected by Mr. W T
Stead, ot the Pall Mall Gazette. When in'the
capital of England a five-pound note will purchase
a;mere child, for vulgarly immoral purposes, it
cannot but be easy to secure young women willing
and even eager, to be lapped in luxury, and to be*
bedizened with the jewellery of a Sultan, a Bev
or a Rajah. Sir W. N. Abdy consequently saw
nothing Improbable in Belt’s .’story, and bought
from him at various times, diamonds to the
amount of eight to nine thousand pounds. Sub-
sequently, however, it came to his knowledge that
Belt had got the stones from London jewellers
and pawnbrokers at prices much below those
which he charged the baronet. O a this charge, the
sculptor and his brother Walter, who had abetted
were indicted; the latter was acquitted, the former
convicted and sent to gaol, wnere, for a year to
come, he will carve road-metal instead of marble.
Richard Belt’s career has been a singular one. Ho
was originally educated at the schools of Baroness
Burdett-Coutts in Rochester Row, and then, his
mother being a widow and very poor, he was ap-
prenticed to Messrs. Dry and Sons, mechanical
engineers, when he, then a mere boy, exhibited
his mechanical ingenuity, and made a carriage
spring which was afterwards exhibited at a work-
man’s exhibition. Then he became a messenger
at Messrs. Spottiswoode’s, the Queen’s printers,
and in carrying proofs backwards and forwards to
the House of Commons he got to know members
of that assembly by sight, a-d although he had
not been taught drawing, he was enabled to sketch
the features of those with whom he was thus
brought in contact. About the year 1864 occurred
a circumstance which fixed Mr. Belt’s future
career. In the neighbourhood of the House of
Commons he picked up a stone which had fallen
from the building, and with a nail and the back of
a hair-brush he carved on it a head which he
showed to two or three friends, who were struck
with the power and skill thus exhibited. As time
passed on Mr. Belt made statuettes and busts of
many distinguished persons, including Lord
Beaconsfleld, Mr. Gladstone, the late Charles
Dickens, and Madame Adelina Patti.

make men ? ” “ Madame,” he replied, “ to keep
the women from assassinating each other.” One
of the conspicuous features on our promenades,

is a tall, noble-looking woman, with the carriage
of a princess, and a profile which once might have
belonged on a cameo. This is Mias Genevieve

verses, and you all know what ihat leads to." And

The Hon. Thomas Holt, M.L.0., of Sydney,
is bound to be a social failure in London. Instead
of smelling round the heels of the aristocracy, he
has been feeding the London poor on beef and
duff. We wonder how many tons of Hour and herds
of beeves would require to be expended before a
seat in the House could be obtained, or even the
august presence of the Duke and Duchess of Teck
at an entertainment of Sir Samuel Wilson. Why,
it will only be by the time that they are all kicking
Henniker for daring to have been born in Kent
(or anywhere), that the Hon. Thomas will com-
mence to be famous.

A new snake-bite
antidote has been dis-

snakes. Five dogs were
bitten, and the result, ac-
cording to a contem-
porary, “ was most satis-

dying in the course of the

seeing Underwood, the

till foolish enough one

The pension is “something over £llOO a year.”

it shows that Mr. Childers is not poor, and quotes
against him his stereotyped hustings speeches to
his constituents in which he. Parliament after Par-

A little story, which has been going the
rounds of the Sunday-schools down North, has at
last got Into those wicked papers and has caused
much sensation in clerical circles. The reverend
shepherd of a rustic flock had a charming young
lady residing with him at his house whom he intro-
duced all round as his niece. The kind friends of
the good pastor have made diligent enquiries and
impudently aver that their spiritual adviser has
no sisters and but one brother, and he (chuckle, ye
heretics 1) is also an unmarried clergyman.
Crooks, the manager of the dead Bank of
South Australia, was pious from the days of his
youth. When he became a man he neither drank
nor swore, and was always first in church on wet
Sundays. He sat with his eyes closed while the
parson preached. The closing of his eyes drew
the skin away from his ears, and so they stayed
wide open and caught everything. After sermon
he taught a Bible Class, and the way the ring of
youths and maidens hung on his fervent exposi-
tions was affecting. Mr. Crooks is, accordingly,
under arrest charged with being the most porten-
tous financier Australia has so far seen.
John Ruskin has not altered his views on

Some of the dependants of the nobility
who voted according to their own humble
opinions at the recent English elections have
suffered prompt punishment. His Grace the Duke
of Northumberland—he calls himself the repre-
sentative of the House of Percy, but his real name
is Smithson (“Duke Smithson of Northumber-
land,” as the Anti-Jacobin has it)-has dismissed
all the under gardeners at Alnwick Castle because
they didn’t support his nomination, Lord Percy.
Now, Adam was a gardener who could afford to
“smile at the claims of long descent.” Put then
our first parent wasn’t in the service of a dook,

Mr. Q. W. Rusden (mulct to the tune of
£5OOO and costs in the action, Bryce v. Rusden) has
discovered that modern history is a ticklish
matter to touch. If he had endeavoured to root
out a few fresh facts about the Wars of the Roses
instead of devoting his attention to the war in
New Zealand, Mr. Rusden would now be a happier
man. Anyway, he should have confined his ad-
verse criticism to those who have departed to a
land where law courts are not. The art of modern-
hlstory-writiug consists in buttering the living
with the reputations of the dead ’uns. In dealing
with recent events, the historian must serve up a
little fact with a lot of tact.
Sir George Bowen, sometime Governor of
Queensland, and of New Zealand and of Victoria,
has left Hongkong for England. At Tientsin,
some years ago, the slimy Bowen met Li Hung-
Chang, the great Chinese Viceroy,(whom he at
once i roceeded to beslaver by dubbing him “ The
Bismarck of China.” Whether Li objected to this
or not does not appear, but he retaliated by calling
his visitor “ Sir Jawbone.” This appealed instantly
to the finer feelings of the Hongkong people, who,
though Sir Gdorge’s departure robs them of the
best joke they had to lay before casual globe-
trotters, are as glad to get rid of their Governor as
have been other communities over whom that
oily personage has presided.
When the Queen of the Belgians goes
shopping “In an informal way,” she often gets
her husband to join her. A London paper says
that the King chats with the shopkeeper, while
the Queen makes her purchases. Recent dis-
closures make us fancy that His Ma jesty wouldn’t
behave so artlessly in a sweet millinery establish-
ment. The chances are that his royal eye is wink-
ing at the prettiest assistants all the while. In-
teresting tales could be told concerning the
temptations whispered Into the ears of “ the girls ”
by blue-blooded gentlemen who go shopping with
their female relations. Perhaps the notorious Mrs.
Jeffries could relate some thrilling stories anent
the millinery mashes of the royal Belgian
Lothario.
Bush-missionary Peter Campbell (the new
Peter the Hermit) who got married suddenly a
long while ago, and is, of course, still in gaol, has
now got on his side C. B. Jones, who threatens to
bring Peter’s case before the Victorian Parliament.
The reverend bush-whacker, prior to this, seemed
likely to die out of contemporary history alto-
gether, for he has been long immured in the vaults
of Melbourne gaol, whence, according to one of
the fossilised laws of Australia, he cannot depart
until he, a penniless and friendless man, finds
security for the payment of maintenance to his
wife. How can a man find money in gaol unless,
perchance, he contrive to borrow it from the
governor,! or the warders, or the flogger, or the
hangman ?
The London correspondent of one of the
B.A. papers has been writing disrespectfully
therein of Mrs. Langtry’s “ knobbly knees.” This
is absurd. Some people, perhaps, find transcen-
dental beauty in knees of that pattern. They may
be—like Katlsha, in the “ Mikado ”—an “ acquired
taste.” Katiaha, too, if you remember, spoke of
her left shoulder blade being a miracle of beauty,
which evidently proves that many connoisseurs
admire a large development of bone In ladies.
Anotomical loveliness is much sought after nowa-
days, and the first enquiry about a new profes-
sional beauty is: “What sort of a skeleton would
she make ?’ Superficial critics might disapprove
of knobbly knees, while a surgeon, from a post
mortem point of view, might go into ecstacies over
them.
Cinnabar Hester is being offered half of
old Kllkivan, the once famous Queensland “dig-
gings,” if he will let the old identities who have
turned storekeepers, bullock-drivers, publicans,
and graziers stand in with him in his late change
of fortune. He has not counted the money into
his pocket yet, but it is considered locally to be a
sure thing. The mountain will all come away in
quicksilver. Before that eminent “guinea-pig,”
the Duke of Manchester, visited the quarter,
which he did In connection with the M'liwraith
Transcontinental Railway, Hester used to go about
with a clouded brow, with few to discount his
prospects, and not even Mackay Brothers to back
up his ideas. The Duke listened, examined, col-
lected evidence, and took his hand. A capital of
£400.000 is now to be placed on the ground.
On the occasion of Mr. Gladstone’s 76th
birthday a servants’ ball was given at Hawarden,
in which Mrs. Gladstone led the first dance with
the chief butler for a partner, and Mr. W. H. Glad-
stone was her vis-a-vis with the housekeeper of
the castle on his arm. The Grand Old Man simply
viewed the proceedings, taking no active part in
the terpslchorean tumult. His sole amusement
now is ringbarking; give him an axe and a three-
foot elm to chop at and the old fellow is in the
seventh heaven of delight. The banjo

palmy days, and the benefactor of the London
public, in introducing to their notice the scantily
clothed Mazeppa—Ada Isaacs Menken. But we
never knew that B, T. Smith was himself the son
of an admiral. Greatness evidently runs in the
family. By the way, L. L. is the apostle of Vic
torian wines, and we shouldn’t wonder if he came
back with an order for a dozen of dry shiraz from
the Queen.
Some years ago a Victorian town clerk
suddenly “cleared” with corporation coin. He
was officially succeeded by a gentleman who
though he had been Mayor of the town, still rel
tained the confidence of the public. He (the new
town clerk) was one of the leading tradesmen of
the place, he was boss of the town volunteers, and
great Mokanna of the local churchwardens; in
short, he was universally trusted and he was
beloved by all. After a virtuous and useful career
he “ pegged out ” the other day without notice'
On the following Sunday the good, simple clergyl
man “improved” the decease of “their dear
friend ” by observing that though sudden death
was ever awful to contemplate, it could be safely
said that few men were better prepared to die
than the lamented town clerk. . . Very soon it
was found that the Corporation funds were a bit
short—a mere trifle of £lOOO or so. . . Later on
it was discovered that the lamented deceased had
been la the habit of lending lucre at merely
nominal interest-say, 40 per cent.—to various
local young noblemen who affected poker and
three-up. . . Such is lifel For of such is the
kingdom of heaven.

When Blackburn
(an American gentleman,
who seemed to have
been a sort of jaynil
and illoquent Daniel
0 Connor, Im Pay), was
running lor Congress, he
happened to be present
one day at an execution
in Owenton, Kentucky.
After the preliminaries
had been arranged, the
sheriff consulted hi s
watch, and discovered
that it was not quite 13
o’clock, the hour fixed
for the execution. Turn-
ing to the prisoner, he
said —“You have 10
minutes yet to live; is
there anything you desire
to say in the meantime ?”
The prisoner sullenly re-
plied there was not. At
this instant Blackburn
sprang from his seat, and,
advancing to the edge of
the scaffold, said—“lf the
gentleman wlli allow me
nls remaining 10 minutes,

myself a candidate for

point the prisoner inter-
jected : “Mr. Sheriff, I
won’t stand on a few
minutes when it’s death
or listening to one of
Joe Blackburn’s speeches.
Flip the trap and let me
go.” The good-natured
sheriff obligingly “flipped

instant the desperado

J ohn Morley, the recently appointed
Secretary for Ireland, is hardly likely to become
the idol of the priesthood. Some years ago he
sent the religious world into hysterics with one of
his literary innovations. The name God was spelt
with a small g in Morley’s writings. Since then,
we believe, he has consented to re-endow the name
of the Deity with a capital letter, but the holy
fathers of Dublin are bound to look upon such an
infidel with suspicion. What If he were to write

Three years ago New Zealand was infested
by hoary-headed snuffling Mormon “ missionary ”
elders, some of whom subsequently found their
way to the Australian continent, and assiduously
prowled round the home of the pretty girl in the
Land of the Kangaroo. The grey-headed sinners
were not altogether unsuccessful in these parts,and
a considerable number of adventurous young
women who hastily elected to be “old men's
darlings” in far-off Utah, are now repenting at
leisure the precipitancy with which they threw
themselves into the arms of the prophet of the
lying Joe Smith. The glory of Mormonism is at
last passing away. The Edmunds Polygamy Act
has come into force, and the gay old Latter Day
Saints are no longer at liberty to obey the com-
mands of Heaven. Lorenzo Snow, the chief of the
twelve apostles of the Mormon Church, has been
found guilty of unlawful cohabitation. For 40
years he has been fighting the good fight, and
now, when 73 winters are upon his head, and
seven wives and 23 children prattle about his
knees, he is pitilessly dragged off and ruthlessly
jugged. Never mind, Lorenzo, beyond the Beauti-
ful River there are crowns, with diamonds in
them as large as soup-platas, waiting for all who,
like you, suffer persecution for conscience sake.
An ingenious little fiction attributed the
Coburg (Melbourne) tragedy to the “ Pall Mall
Gazette Revelations.” All the Melbourne reporters
furnished true and particular accounts of how
Mrs, Hampton and her daughters had gloated over
every detail of the Lily Armstrong case, and de-
veloped a morbid condition of mind in conse-
quence. The Argus “improved” the occasion
by pointing out how widespread was the evil re-
sulting from Mr. Stead’s attempt to throw light
upon the pastimes of the wealthy classes. Even
the English papers got hold of the “Coburg

We have the honour to announce to the elite of
Sydney that’we have opened those premises in the
Royal Arcade, under the designation of the
“ Ghosvbnor Galleries, ” where we shall carry
on the business of High-class Photography.
We have come accompanied by a staff of com-
petent artists trained in leading English, Conti-
nental, and American Studios, at the head of whom
is Mr. Thomas C. Cleave who has had the privileged
and distinguished honour of being afforded the
opportunity of assisting at the Photographing of

a very celebrated 44 apostle of prayer and
, iTi.” is in Australia just now. We refer to the
George Muller, founder of the splendid
ornhan Asylum near Bristol. Mr. Muller is old
nS very much in earnest, that is to say, he has
Son thundering out the same tale for so many
«nars that he has to believe it. Up to 20 years of
y oho went to theatres and was dead in trespasses
Hi n Four months later he left off going to
♦hoatres and was immediately 44 born again.” But
doesn’t explain Mr. Muller’s grand success in
iifo “Faith” made him. In 1830, when he was
i.inning an Ebenezer Chapel, Mr, Muller took unto
himself a wife. Looking around for a ready
-noons of bettering his circumstances, Mr. M.
thought of ’’faith.” So he 44 gave up pew rents
«nd threw himself on voluntary gifts, for which a
hnx was set up in the chapel. He was often re-
duced to a few shillings, but he made known his
wants to the Lord only, and they were usually
aiiDDlied.” Mr. Muller’s philanthropical ventures
have been so uniformly successful that he may be
excused for some of his rather unpractical “faith”
doctrines. The pew rent experiment was a clever
nne and it came off. But we wouldn’t advise a
dav’labourer to throw up his fixed wage and rely
noon voluntary gifts. 44 Faith” may do wonders
when you have a “ box set up” somewhere. But,
take down the box-and where are you ?
“ The Rise and Fall of H. Mortimer
Franklyn,” related by himself in the Melbourne
Insolvency Court, is a narrative of considerable
interest. It is impossible to say how much the
blue-eyed Mortimer will carry out (we’re thinking
of the burial service) of Victoria, but’tis certain
that he brought very little into it. Bis capital,
when he landed, was 34 shillings. That money,
instead! of being bartered away for creature-com-
forts, was utilised in founding the now historical
Victorian Review- A company was floated for
the Review, ; and Mortimer managed it at a
salary of £lO a week. It was soon after this that
the gifted journalist supplied a long-felt want by
producing his great work, “Australia in 1880.”
Anyone wishing to discover the condition of this
continent in 1860 needn’t wsste his time in rooting
out a copy of that book. Mortimer’s examination
convinces us that Australia was uncommonly
“green” at that period. For drivelling about
the j“industries” of some 83 firms the wily
author was subsidised to the extent of £4OOO in
“presentation cheques.” Great Scott! itmakesthe
mouth water. If we could only get at some of the
Archangels, and manage to float 44 Heaven in 1886 ”
(bound in gold cloth), what wouldn’t we ole
worth! But to resume. The bail was now at
Mortimer's feet, and a touch from his patent
leather-shoe set the ball a rolling. Within eight
months of starting the Federal Australian, he
sold it for £12,000 Then came the World.
We fancy the decline of Mortimer’s greatness
dates from the birth of that unhappy, miserable
World. ’Twas a slow decline (not nearly so rapid
as that of the company which purchased his
literary treasures, and lost under his management,
£70,000;, but alas! it was sure. In the month of
January, 1886-melancholy epochl-H. Mortimer
Franklyn, Esq., pawned his watch and chain I
What the future may have in store for this re-
markable man, it would be hard to say. One
thing we would venture to predict. The bar-
ometer of his chequered fortunes will never again
fall so low as 245.
The departure of Mr. Holt, manager of
the Sydney branch of the Bank of New Zealand,
from the city bus caused a great deal of discussion.
Mr. Holt was regarded as one of the ablest men
in his profession, and to his personal exertions and
aptitude the extensive business worked up by the
New Zealand Bank was mainly due. To a genial
address he added a prompt and decisive j udgment
alike of men and measures. It was no secret
whatever that he was what is called a racing man.
He attended the principal meetings without any
affectation of concealment, and was reported to
bet rather heavily. These predilections could not
fall to tell against a man in his position, and ac-
cordingly the inspector, on his last visit, a few
months ago, becoming aware of these facts, and
of other reports affecting Mr. Holt’s affairs
-such as alleged speculations in land, laid
the matter on his return to New Zealand, be-
fore the Board. Inconsequence, he was Instructed
to return to Sydney and make a particular inves-
tigation, and re-appeared on the scene quite un-
expectedly. An investigation into the treasury
or the bank and into its transactions generally
satisfied the inspector that everything in connec-
tion with Holt’s official business was in perfect
order. But other matters connected with Mr
Holt’s own affairs bore a somewhat doubtful
aspect. Mr. John Bennett had complaints to make
of transactions with Mr. Holt, and altogether it
was judged advisable that that gentleman should
be relieved, at least temporarily, and until his
affairs w ere cleared up, of his managerial position,
and it was arranged that he should proceed to New
Zealand on Thursday last Mr. Holt, however,
without apprising the bank authorities, antici-
pated that date and departed without leaving
word respecting his destination, thus giving colour
to the growing rumours that he was an Instance
of another good man gone wrong. Mr. Holt was
hked by the customers of the bank, who
had the more confidence in his straightlorwa d-
imss and integrity inasmuch as he made no pre-
tence of unco guidness. He is a comparatively
man with an agreeable person and manners,
ana at the present state of information regarding
affairs a great deal of regret is felt and expressed
mat a man apparently possessed of a multitude of
good and amiable qualities should have destroyed
his career by being In a hurry to get rich, and by
fooling with racehorses.
“ Mr. R. Cowan ” is a gentleman with
sufficient of a grievance to make the Manning.
River Times grovel in the good old rustic style
He writes to complain of the “ omission of his
name from the passenger-list ” of the Sydney
steamer. “ This, he states, misleads his friends,
who think he has not arrived—or when they find
that he has, fancy he travelled in the steerage.’
This little picture, as we have estimated, brought
the conductor of the M.R.T. right down on his
“ little turn,” for he hastens to gasp-but we will
not expose the whole extent of the degradation.
We merely state that he concludes his apologetic
par. as follows:' 4 We are sorry if annoyance has
been caused Mr. Cowan or his friends ” We infer
from the foregoing that Mr. Cowan must either be
a king in these parts—or a beadle. Immortal
Jove! Fancy a beadle in the steerage! Fancy a
beadle whose 44 friends might not think he had ar-
rived,” and not be on the wharf in the silver grey
of coming dawn, with a waggonette, a blue flag,
and a slice of the local band! If Mr. Cowan be
neither a king nor a beadle what on earth is he,
that he arrogates to himself the right to raise
thunder because the poor printer has forgotten
to put his name in the paper for nothing ? What
does he travel for, anyhow, that holds the poor
editor, as it were, in the palm of his hand ? We
darkly suspect for either time-payment, back
action, extra-escape-value lever watches, or
(alasl)-for paper.

T
O THB MEMBERS OE THE AUSTRALIAN
MUTUAL PROVIDENT SOCIETY.
Ladies and gentlemen,—l respeottully solicit your
Votes and Interest as a Director of your Society,
of which I am and have been a member for 36 years.
I think it due to you to speak with no uncertain
voice with respect to the action of the Board in
establishing a branch in England for the tahmg of
step to be unwise, and that the
opinion of the members should have been obtained
prior to adopting such a momentous change in the
policy of the society. ....
v I deem this the more incumbent on the directors
as the decision was NOT the unanimous vote of the
Board, but ONLY CARRIED by the votes of a
majority of the directors.
I hope I have a claim on your suffrages, as I have
always exerted myself to promote the prosperity
of the Society; and many of the reforms in the by-
laws of the Society are due to my strenuous ad-
vocacy, notably the present salutary change now
in force in the mode of electing the Directors. I
have for years advocated and successfully caused
the abrogation of the proxy system, so much
abused, viz , the admittedly corrupt one of elect-
ing Directors by the use of proxis. I for many
years protested against suicidal clause (happily re-
pealed) under which the widow and orphans were
deprived of all claim in the event of the insured
dying by his own hand. I have also been an ad-
vocate for all beneficial reforms and for the cur-
tailment of the expenses of the Society, consistent
with its well-being, and the full and liberal con-
sideration of its employees, always remember-
ing “ that the labourer is worthy of his tire.”
Should you do me the honour of electing me I
will perform my duty faithfully and honourably,
and study the best interests ot the members. At
foot I attach a few opinions of the Press and am,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Yours very faithfully,
FIIBDK. LEE.

“In another column appears an advertisement
from Mr. Frederick Lee, J.P., who is a candidate
for the office of Director of the Australian Mutual
Provident Society. Amongst the many reforms
Mr. Lee has obtained in the government of this in-
stitution he for years advocated, and at length
successfully caused the abrogation of the proxy
system, which had been so much abused. He has
always taken a great and active interest in the
Society, and we wish him success, as we think his
election to a seat at the Board would conduce to
the prosperity of the Society. ’’—Suburban Times.
“ Some short time since Mr. T. H. Green brought
under the notice of Mr. F. Lee, of Sydney (a gentle-
man who has always exhibited a large interestin
the affairs of the A. M. P. Society, and is a can-
didate for the vacancy on the Board of Directors)
the danger attending the issue of policies on a
single life up to £lO,OOO. Mr, Lee condemns those
rarge risks, and considers that the members of the
Society ought to have been consulted by the
Directors in regard to such a change or policy,
although they have the power to do what is com-
plained of. Mr, Lee appears to be the right stamp
of man for the members of the Society to select
as one of their management.”—Richmond River

Which is our roundabout way of saying
what is more briefly, but we modestly think less
elegantly expressed in the sparkling columns of
the Evening Alfred by the phrase always kept
on tap, took well and gave pleasure to all,” And
we don’t mind saying that If we had trusted to
prose we might perhaps have had our little say
about Grade Piaisted without piling such an ab-
normal quantity of “ preserve ” upon her little
plate. But poetry is so deceptive, and gives such
tree scope to the imagination that in handsstrange
to its use it is apt to put quite too roseate a tint
upon the subject. And we further admit
that the Muse is to us a comparative
stranger. We have not dropped into verse
since we were last in love, and, lor I we have
been married now for six years. But even in
solemn prose we do not hesitate to say that If
there is any cake going round In dramatic circles
now, Graoie s share of It is all but the plate
When she was here before, we gave her all the
oleomargarine that we judged could be safely
donated to one so young, and we are now pre-
pared to give her the unappropriated balance.
She has loft as big a foot-print on the sands of
time—and tune—as so Lilliputian a foot can be
expected to impress. Her voice seems to have
gained about 300 canary-power since she started
to mash the Maoris, and her ” business ” through-
out on Saturday night was excellent a
thing to be wondered at considering that this was
her first appearance in the role, and that it is
no a r “ ea °® “..“f one to master; but
she rose to the billows of harmony and floated
buoyantly over its more placid places never seem-
ing t0 j grow wea l y °|tha demands of melody.

about Grade’s performance, and we do not doubt
but that opera-glasses will be in great reouest
during the rest of the season-the modern ElHah’s

hear so much better with these, you know, when

±tea aanas and wet eyes are predominant in many
scenes. Villainy, with a world s curses on its
gnarled soapy visage, is everywhere. The inno-
cent frankness of impulsive childhood, the timor-
ous gentleness of sensitive maidenhood, the lus-
trous beauty of noble self-sacriflciog womanhood
are here; and here, too, about them are the itchy
dames of gossipy scandal, with their tongues
of tongues and their laughs making

as, sitting in his cloud-floored attic in the Empy-
rean, with the crying of spaces to be filled surging
up and in throush crevices of his walls of fleece-
iike sunshine, will, when he has had his run, with-
draw us. Other playrights will then get a turn.
Hardly another will ever take humanity for a
subject again.

At the Sydney Gaiety, on Monday even-
ing, the 35th week of the Dampier season was
opened by the production of a “ Royal Pardon,”
described as a London success. Taere is no room
to doubt that a royal pardon would be a success
even in Sydney, and a vice-regal reprieve be occa-
sionally welcomed with demonstrations of satis-
faction by the people of this enlightened colony.
But the rope and lash are too much loved in our
courts for the royal clemency to be mere than oc-
casionally sought.
* * *
The “ fat” of the piece falls to Mr. Dam-
pier, who, in a oourtrayal of four distinct charac-
ters, gave proofs of a return of that versatility of
which lately he has apparently been too sparing.
Boothman, as a character in every-day life was
more natural than is usual amongst stage
followed the advice Shakesperian,
«i vi moi i ey purse,” with commendable
fldellty.and was no more particular about the means
of achieving wealth than the average mining spe-
culator, who wild-cat’s a ’section, and slopes leav-
ipg nothing but an empty safe and a deal table to
testify to his existence ever having been more
than a fable. As Jonas Grimwood, a deformed
boatman, Leston held a part which he suited, and
Joe Mark, as Captain Seafield, looked every inch a
sailor. As Joseph cannot sail across to North
bhore without symptoms of seasickness it is fair
to assume he is more likely to shine as a long shore
captain than as a tar who ploughs the raging main.
Btoneham, whose early life is spent in a law-
yers oifle?, becomes at the conclusion of
the piece a millionaire, and this change in
his circumstances gains him more friends than
ever fell to the lot of any other honest man. For
it is a peculiarity of the law tbit its interpreters
are overwhelmed with a desire to be more strictly
honest than a Commercial Bank manager mf
South Australia) or a Sydney pickpocket. The
ladies have parts in which walking about seems to
be their chief end and aim. Misses Dampier and
Merton are graceful pedestrians ; while Miss
Katherine Russell as Peggy, a friend of the
family, imbues her part with a plebeian natural-
ness which is most affecting. The scenery by
Kinchela is excellent, though occasionally the
manner of its moving is not marked by the
easy grace which marks the motions of a peram-
bulator in Ihe hands of a hired nurse-girl. The
piece will give way to “ Hamlet ” on Friday even-
ing, with Dampier as the melancholy Dane.
** * *
At Sydney Alhambra a good and varied
programme is presented each evening. The first
part is interspersed with witticisms of a stupen-
dously high order. No negro minstrel jokes are
ever alarmingly funny, and it Is with a feeling of
sorrow almost that the listening crowd hear any
attempt to work off a new gag. This departure
announces the fact in large capital letters that the
minstrel has taken his brains out, and intends to
run for Parliament.
* * *
Miss Hope’s item on Monday evening was
“Only a little.pair of shoes,” and judging from
the young vocalist’s efforts to tear the notes from
her chest, we would suggest “only a little bottle
of cough mixture.” on a future occasion. It is
sad to see one’s Hope blighted, and Hope sick
maketh the heart think of a spade. Hugo’s comi-
calities found vent in the number “ Dancing with
May.”
* * *
Miss Fraser was in good voice, as was the
ever-popular Matlock. Miss Nina Tulloch is still
awakening the forest echoes of the scenery with
the song of the “ Maid and the Magpie,” in which
the thrill of the forest bird is faithfully repro-
duced by the fair vocalist. She is, “fair with
golden hair” in this act, but in the preceding part
she sits as a brunette, a sort of two-headed or two-
hairad nightingale.

At the New Oddfellows’ Hall, Elizabeth-
street, Sydney, the Vanity Fair Company are
playing to good business. This entertainment
will run with the smoothness of an omnibus when
a few of the vocalists learn to ting. The end men
are good, and some of the specialities are more
humorous than a banquet speech on Imperial
Federation.

Hiscocks’ combination at the Sydney
Academy of Music are now in their Btth conse-
cutive week of performances of universal excel-
lence, The first part, with which the names of
Dunbar, Porter, Amery, and Braham are asso-
ciated, is a musical end melodio"8 performance, in
which a noticeable feature is the blending of the
various voices in the choruses. It is in each in-
stance a Royal blend.aJ.RD ofvocilism. The
farce of “ The Judge’s Substitute,” which we have
seen before under a different title, winds up the
merriest two hours' fun we have sat through
since our mother-in-law became a ghost.

We have to congratulate Mr. Widow John
Sheridan upon having secured, in Sydney, a three-
act comedy from the electric pen of Mr. Leopold
Jordan. The piece is, a contemporary tells us, to
be product d in Sydney first, then to tour the Aus-
tralian colonies, and, finally, to be brought out in
London. It this be true, it would be a good move
for Mr. Sheridan to take Leopold with him. He
would come in useful pointing out the jokes of his
production—with a stick.

Dan. Barry, speaking at Tenterfleld on
Monday night, at the conclusion of his perfor-
mance of “ Euchred” said at last ho had come to
Paradise. The editor in replying through the
columns of the Star, said “ Thanks, very much;
we’ve been looking forward to that elysium of
bliss for sometime past, and didn’t know we had
readied It.” This is an honest sentiment, Star.
We agree with ycu—the man who would locate
Paradise in New England would certainly place
Slkol in Paradise. But Dan. has been in scores of
heavens in his travels. Every place where he
makes a c;ear fiver is described as Paradise in his
“ few words of heartfelt thanks.”

W. S. Gilbert’s humour is a little too deep i
for a good many people who affect to roar over
his conceits. Anent the “ Mikado” production, we
find a terrible sample of obtuseness in a little
Melbourne journal. Says some critical genius—
“ Alice Barnett is most disappointingly tall. One
doesn’t expect Sweet Little Buttercup to be live

in Adelaide a Mr. Stuart Cumberland is
Af u U£d; now ' , The good citizens of the city
of churches are so down in the dumps over their
banking and other ca'amities that they have not
much energy left for taking an interest in any-
»•«?£. ex traneous; still they have been asking:
Who is Mr. 8. C. ? Echo, who is asfeed more i
questions than a city editor could answer, gives
no reply, but not so Mr. Cumberland himself—on !
the, contrary, he floods the guileless dailies with
notices of his past doings in various parts of the
globe to such an extent as almost to threaten ex-
clusion to the übiquitous tea-fight and its cheer-
rui corollary, the prayer-meeting. Mr. Stuart
Cumberland telegraphed his approach to the
papers, came, saw, and conquered. Into the in-
nocent ears of the youths who went to “ inter-
yiew him on the steamboat, he poured the in-
toxicating tale of genial “ receptions ” by princes,
peers, and potentates, of chats with Gladstone and
WBle9 < Bismarck and Gortchakoff, Prester John
and Kublai Khan. Here is a sample:-“I have
been received in every Court in Europe,” said Mr.
Cumberland, ‘ and have touched (whatever that

tics. The night alter I arrived at St. Petersburg

or the Czar, and two other dukes. While talking
about politics one of them said to me,” &o. Lots
ot it like that; in factSMr. C. doesn’t seem to know
anybody beneath the dignity of a “ dook.” It was
a u B °t. gor^eouB the distinguished traveller,
who by the way, announces himsslfas a Jingo
after Beaconsfield’s own heart, a tbirster after
Russian blood, and an Imperialist of the most
spread-eagle type-was received by Governor
Robinson. This in Itself is rather a rare occurrence,
because Governor Kobinson, although he lives in
the driest country in Australia—some say in the
world-sees plenty of rainy days ahead; at least he
is always laying by for them. There may even be
a natural aihnity.betiveen a c’airvoyant Governor
and a thought-reading globe-trotter. Then the
Press announced that although Mr. S. C. had
retired from any public] display of his powers,
there was a "very general desire” tnat he
should give a seance in the Town Hall,
and there was a “possibility” that Mr. S. C. would
incline his ear to this desire; and, sure enough, the
posters were out next day. Is not Adelaide dull
enough without having that slowest and dreariest
.°f ‘shows”- a mind-reading tdance-intlicted on
it r bin J t may, by severe contrast, seem almost
cheerful to the poor Fariaopolltans, whose every
place of evening amusements—save the pubs-ls
now clpsed, and who are sitting in the valley of
mourning, moaning and gnashing their teeth,
plastering their heads with oil of piety and the
ashes of bankruptcy, and having a very lugubri-
ous time of it altogether. Mr. Stuart Cumber-
land has, it appears, written a "shilling awful,”
called The Rabbi’s Spell,” and he thus begins a
criticism on it in an Adelaide daily:-" Mr. Stuart
Cumberland is truly a most versatile gentleman;
nothing sterns to be beyond his reach, and his
talents-as the London Daily News puts it-not
only range from finding concealed pins in West-
minster to reading the hidden thoughts of diplo-
pallets ia Bt. Petersburg*, but political and literary
laurels also appear to be within his grasp.” Wo
may add that Mr, Cumberland doesn’t blush worth
a cent. Mr. S, C. is going to matte the tour of
Australia, interview all the leading politicians,
find out all about everything, return home, be
elected into Parliament straight off the reel, re-
present Imperial union there, and then—ah, what
then?
** * *
There is a good deal, in a glance at the
London Era, to interest an Australian who can
read. We see that Bland Holt has entered into
partnership with his ancient gov., Clarence, and
that the two are busking about the provinces
with much cheeriness with " The World ” and
‘The Stockbroker" respectively, Bland’s Moss
Jewell "being acknowledged by the Press to be a
marvellous creation ” (which is a good hearing),
while of Clarence's Stockbroker it is asserted
(excellent intelligence, also) that "it is a part into
which no actor living could possibly infuse so
many pathetic touches.” In another page we find
advertised a good-natured agency which “has
been instrumental in obtaining several of its
clients £5OO, £lOOO, and even £5OOO damages for
libellous p iragraphs in newspapers, which without
its aid might not have come under their notice.”
There’s no necessity, thank Heaven, for the estab-
lishment of such an agency in Sydney—the want
has long been supplied by certain Hebrew and
alleged Christian attorneys. As, in order to trans-
act his business with success, the man who keeps
this office must read "every dramatic criticism
published,” we feel we must pity rather than con-
demn him. Mrs. Scott-Siddons has “an adven-
ture” in the same issue, which consists in not
arrivieg until half-past 9 p.m. to show at an enter-
tainment at Birkenhead, in which she was adver-
tised to appear at 8. She explained when she got
there that the cabman had been driving in a circle
ever since she had engaged him, at 7 o’clock.
Nothing was said, of course, about “giving the
boys time to put up the plunder.”

Madame Lottie-Montal Poussard, the de-
posed prima donna ot the Melbourne Opera
House, has been let in for £l5, carriage hiro, on
the suit of a stony-hearted livery-stable keeper.
Madame made two pleas. Firstly, that she was
partner with Mr. Sam Moore in the Opera House
spec , and the "firm ” was responsible. Secondly,
that managements are in duly bound to supply
barouches (as well as bouquets) for their "prime
donee.” Madame’s partnership-alas! was mythi-
cal, ard-oh, disenchantment! her salary was 10
notes per week. After deducting some £7 odd
forthe barouche, little but glory remained. The
other day our eagle eye fell upon a novelette
called, " She would be an Actress.” We thought
of Madame, and sighed.

Henry Irving, says a London paper, pre-
sented eveiy member of his company with a goote
and a bottle ot spirits on Christinas Eve. Lucky
people! Plenty of setors "get the goose ” from
the public, but no bottle of spirits accompanies
the gift, unless ’tia an empty one hurled by a play-
ful " god.” Speaking of that, we remember offend-
ing a tragedian by telling him that he required a
large stage to display his Othello to the best ad-
vantage. He shook us by the hand and said that
he was quite of our opinion. “ Yes,” we suggested,
“a good deev stage, where you can keep out of
bottle-range.”

view to stumping this bleeding country with a
lecture about his deceased uncle—who, by the
way, may bo said to have been at the bottom of
our expenditure cf £l3O 000 of lawful cornstalk
money over the So'jwaugoat-battue. There have
been so many conflicting reports regarding the
capture of Khartoum that it is gratifying to find
that there is at last a prospect of our getting at
the real facts. Just now the matter stands thus.
The last struggle was commenced by Gordon, who
sallied;[forth at the head of his garrison, and
slaughtered the Arabs to the last man, and took
all the rest prisoners. Scarcely half the army
escaped, and the Mahdi, who was among the dead,
was brought into the city and publicly executed.
Next day Arab leaders burning to ayenge this
disaster, assailed Khartoum, and carrying the city
by storm, made an indiscriminate massacre of the
garrison and inhabitants, not one being spared,
Gordon was slain at the first onslaught, but
having afterwards succeeded in rallying his troops
he drove out the Arabs and kulcd the M«hdi with
his own hand. This defeat preyed so much on the
mind of the Prophet that he was struck by light-
niog and died of cholera. The same evening he
committed suicide, and next morning wae seized
with a severe attack],of measles which speedily
carried him ©if. He also perished during the
ensuing week of croup, scarlatina, "growing pains,
whooping cough, and extreme old age, and hav-
iog been still-born, he was laid in the ground
with appropriate ceremony. A severe cold,
which he caught about this time, prevented
him resuming active operations for some days,
and a distraint for rent added to the diffi-
cult its of the Art,b army. A council ot war
was held to discuss the advisability of abandon-
ing the siege, but Osman l>igna haying arrived


A really smart lad was summoned at a
Melbourne court, last week, lor a driving over—or
knocking down- an old lady. He had to make a
defence of some sort or another, and was looking
round the room for inspiration when his eyes
lighted on what appeared to be a bunch of imita-
tion fruit in the old lady’s bonnet. The lad
glibly explainer that his horse was “ vetry fond of
fruit,” aud had madly dashed at the bonnet and
knocked down the weartr. Alasl the bonnet
trimming turned out to be Beraclums, and the
youthful genius was mulct of half a sovereign.
by the mixed train at 3 45, it was resolved to re-
new the attack. This assault, however, was no
more successful than the last, and the Mahdi’s
irritation was so extreme that he was turned into
a pillar of salt, while Osman rushed down a steep
place into the sea and they gathered up the
fragments of him—lo baskets full. Next day
Khartoum was captured, and Osman Digna
hanged himself upon a gallows 40 cubits high, and
the Mahdi died o f apoplexy, and convulsions, and
leprosy and lumbago, and teething, and com-
mencad his march upon Cairo. Gordon was
killed after h!s heroic defence, but having made
his escape, he fled to Central Africa, and still oon-
tlnues’to hold Khartoum with indomitable valour
against overwhelm’ ng odds. The latest telegrams
announco there never was such a place Far-
ther d tails are expected very shortly, and the
police have a clue to the perpetrator of the out-
rage.

The thirteenth 1‘ arliament of Victoria was
opened by commission on March 16th, and imme-
diately adjourned until June Ist. "Speaking
plainly,” says the Melbourne Herald, "Parlia-
ment has been assembled for the swearing in of
members, in order that they may commence to
draw their salaries without a moment's necessary
delay.”
“ Decency” has been writing to the Mel-
bourne Age comp'aining of " the intolerable an-
noyance which gentlemen are compelled to endure
day after day at the Brighton baths through
women and girls taking up their quarters close to
the fence.” As poor "Decency” has decided to
" abandon the baths till this long-standing griev-
ance is removed,” and as we don’t think it will be
removed so long as girls are girls, we would mildly
suggest a compromise:—
We crave your Christian pity
For a man of Melbourne city
Whosuffers 'neath a cruel social wrong;
Let us give some explanation
Of his dreadful situation
In a sad and sentimental little song.
Now th’s party (call him Howell)
Likes to take a Turkish towel!
And sally to the seashore for a swim;
A portion sma'l is fenced in,
Reserved for keeping gents, in,
;Whieh is, of course, the proper place fo,r him.
But when he goes a swimmin’
He has noticed that the “ wimmin ”
Get looking through the palings all the while,
As though much interested
In the manly form divested
Of garments (in the early Bleu style).
This bashful son of Adam
Doesn’t like the eyes of madam
Fixed upon bim-no, he doesn’t think it right;
And he blushes deepest crimson
As, disgustedly, he swims on,
Or dives to keep his figure out of sight.
But, despite his molest blushing,
The wom.nkiLd keep rushing
To the margin of the ocean every day;
They take up cosy quarters,
Close against those sacred waters,
And watch him while their little s'sters play.
Poor H. unhappy made is
By this habit of the ladi s -
His anger and bis shame are most intense;
He finds it past all bearing
That they always should be staring
With such calm delibeßatlon through the fence.
So he put a letter solemn
la the corrtsponden 3e column
Of a piper stating plainly that no more
Would he ever thinking of bathing
While the ladies kept behaving
In that giddy sort of w ay upon the shore.
Now, dear womenkted of Brighton,
Unless you want to frighten
This gentleman away, you can’t do less
Than ask him for his measure
(He’ll give it you with pleasure)
And make him up a decent bathing dress.
Then, with everything de riyueur ,
H® can swim around with vigour.
And never funk your g-ze a little bit;
You can take yeur usual places,
And ad nlre his manly graces—
But mind you make the bathing dress a fit.

It is all very well for the gifted Alfred, of
the T. and C. Jernil. who was just emerged from
the aiijtocratic atmosphere of Vere de Vere
gardens, to on bis arrival, essay, at one fell
swoop, to civilise us. But, let him think of himself
before he could tilt across the herring-pond at will,
and absorb civiiz ’.'ion at the fathlonab.e fount of
tlenulkerl Does he remember the time when he
was a regular customer up the crazy stairs of
the Crown and Anchor, and we used together to
have four courses and “a long shandy” for a
shilling ? It would seem not, anyhow, for there is
an article by, or perhaps inspired by-any how,
printed under the auspices of-Alfred in last
week’s T. and C. Jernil, which can only be re-
garded as a cruel specimen of either his wilful
forgetfulness or bis polished cynicism. It is not
without feelings of alarm at our old friend's
audacity that we gingerly quote from the con-
tribution. “Don’t,” Bays Alfred (the “knocker”
of him!)—"Don't st etch across your neigh-
bour’s plate in order to reach anything. ”
This! and he, too, with a distinct recollection of
dinners at which when you said: “Slide down
the cruet,” there was an indignant snort; and
when you cried: the salt,” there was a
fight. You would think he would stop here, and
WHAT THE STAGE NEEDS IS NEW IDEAS.
WE OFFER A FEW SUGGESTIONS, FREE OF CHARGE.
This style of fall is becoming monoto-
nous on the stage.
Why not try this for a change? It
would be much more thrilling.
Then there is that tiresome old escape
from prison by a rope.
This would be much quicker, and

Instead of the conventional way of de-
livering a stagemessage—
Let us have something oliginal,
like this.

Now that the Duchess of Connaught, ac-
cording to a cablegram in the daily papers, has
been safely delivered of a daughter, the military
career of that gallant paladin, her husband (out-
side of semry-couotlcg et Windsor), n ay be said
to be at an end. His Koyal Highness, with this
addition to his family, will have no time, now, to
uphold the honour of his suffering country by
potting niggers abroad. All his leisure will be
taken up for the next year or so by shovelling in
the pap. There is one comfort, however I—His
Royal Highness's reputation as an intrepid
sdbreur has been fully established ever since he
charged the Egyptian rebels at the head of his
squadron at the battle of Bashi-Burgoo There is
a full page portrait of it in the Graphic, and the
slaughter is depicted as being terrific; the Duke
sitting his charger apparently unmoved with a
Boy-on-the-bnrnlng-deck expression of counte-
nance. It seems, however, that this pleasant pic-
ture was not to go unchallenged. Rumour has it
that Prince Arthur previous to starting out on
the campaign, had quarrelled with his impe-
cunious relative, the Duke of Tick, owing to his
Serene Highness's persistence in conferring upon
the Princess Mary the decoration of the boot; and,
after the battle in question, Tick (who was a
Postmaster-General to the forees) put it about
that during the charge he had, by the Queen’s
orders, kept his Cousin of Connaught locked up in
the main postal bungalow until all the damage
was over, and that his Serene Highness hlmsc’f
headed the sanguinary charge- He further said
that, when all was quiet, Piiac« Arthur was banded
a battered shako and a notched cutlass, and
told to mount and spread himself out as much as
possible. This is a gross libel, of course, upon the
Loyal General ol Brigade; and it doubtless only
attracted attention at the time in consequence of
the fact being undeniable that the Duke of Tick,
in spite of his little domestic foibles, was a real
soldier.

The Lord Bishop of Madagascar appears
to be in no paiticular hurry to reach the city of
Mollygoaisy and commence his diocesan duties
for the doctor is still amongst us in Sydney; and
only last Sunday, preached before the congrega-
tion of Bt Potts with much effect, to the text, we
understand, of “ Put money in thy puree;” the
hat being sent whizzing round directly after the
sermon, with results of a satisfactory na’ure
This circumstance will,’ doubtless, have the effect
of putting Dr. Kestell-Cornish in lees of a hurry
to leave us than ever; and if the Y.M.C.A. boys
would unite together and get up some sports in
aid of the mission—with foot-racing and a totali-
sator—we would not surprised to find his lord-
ship settling down upon a water-frontage, and
scouring the soul of the Malagasian nigger from
the shores of Balmain—or Darling Point. The
doctor is practically unencumbered. As he says,
he has “ only 10 men with him, one of whom was
h's son, who was acting without any salary.” Au.
hesoin, then, the doctor could tend all or some of
this snug little band of apostles.nigger-oonverting;
though, if he take our advice, his lordship will
hang on to at least a couple of them, in view of
their being required later to perform upon the
wood-heap and to execute fantasias upon the
well-winch. We don’t mind saying right out, that
if we were the Doctor, we would’nt gol The
Madagascar niggers are getting on very well
without him, and he would be far more com-
fortable here, occupied with his little building
society during the week, and his little apostolic
tank (he could easily run one up) on Sundays. One
sternly significant fact is that his lordship has
already been called upon by nine sewing-machine
agents and the American lightning-rod man,—the
scent of the latter for buildings about to sprout
being marvellous. His lordship’s party, we may
remark, is socially popular; and, in answer to an
enquiry instituted at the boarding-house at which
they are residing, tbeir landlady replied, in
quavering tones, that the rev. gentlemen were in

“ Mabel Pride, a governess, aged 21, having
no lawful means of support, was sent to gaol for
one month," by a N.B.W. Banoh, recently. And is
it for this our girls are made “young ladies?” Miss
Pride got a month’s gaol. She had no “lawful
means of support.” Is not the occupation of a
governess lawful? Her parents should now bo
brought to the same court and given seven years
for being accessories before the act. Had they
taught her to bake, wash, cook, mangle, mend, &c.»
Mabel had probably now been earning her good
15s. weekly with a mistress to bounce and a uni-
formed lover. They taught her to governess and
she goes to gaol. Out on our high notions; let
common sense have an occasional chance. The
harp:—
It were better for the woman if in early youth
she’d died,
And slept where daisies blossomed o’er the grave
of “ Mabel PriJe;”
Better for her that the News post mortem man had
tolled her knell;—
“ Dearest Mabel, how we miss thee, none but
bleeding hearts can tell.”
Better this had been her portion—though the verse
were hard to bear -
Than be cast within a prison cell, a felon’s lot to
share:
For a simple crime convioted—but the crime of
being poor—
Still a stigma rests upon her, she may honest be
no more.
In a month her penance ended when the gaping
world she meets—
Well, one less within the prison—p’raps one more
upon the streets.
Says the Melb. Hbbald “ Thirty-three
years ago Duncan Gillies and Peter Lalor, the
present Premier and Speaker of the Victorian
Parliament, were working a rich mine together
at Ballarat. Give us the keynote G on the trom-
bone—
Blue-shirted and gay, the Herald doth say,
Tnat Duncan and Peter of old,
In laborious way punched away at pipeclay,
In search of the glittering gold.
They hit on it rich, a fact over which
We’ll neither despute now nor row,
But we bet a new hat, and liquor round, that
They’re working a richer mine now.
The Business oe the House.
A Senate House, we’ve often heard our worthy
fathers state,
Was where a lot of people met to talk and legislate:
A building to the making of our
laws—
Or rather, where some made ’em, and the others
“ spotted” flaws.
But times are altered, men are changed, and poli-
tics, we And,
Are scarcely what they were in days our fathers
called to mind;
For senators aisemble now with nothing else in
view
Than getting duly qualified to go land draw their
“ screw.”
The wi Ifare of the colony they have at heart at
times—
But two ever present questions are the dollars and
the dimes
Thera’s business and business, their country’s and
the’r own—
So the latter is transacted while the former's left
alone.
But does the public suffer when the “members”
take a rest
From their Parliamentary duties ? It must really
be confessed
We think it would be better if those members
drew their pay
On the simple understanding that they always
kept away.
THE VIRTUE OF GIN.
They christened her Belle
Twenty short years ago;
The haby was fair
And the curls of her hair
All so prettily fell
On her forehead of snow.
At the foot of a hill,
In a flower-gemmed dell,
Her first years passed away,
And so softly, that they
Nought had seemed to instill
But the tale flowers tell.
Just away to the North
The strange quivering glare
Of a great city’s gas
Seemed to beckon the lass.
And she gaily tripped forth
To the lights buraing there.
But bright rays waxed pale
When a twelvemonth had fled,
And her spirit grew weak,
Though a daub lit her cheek;
But it naught could avail
I'or a heart that was dead.
Nor a life that was sunk
In the despond of sin;
And she shivered with dread
Just to think of those dead—
Then sailed off and got drunk—
’Tls the virtue of gin.


WARNBR’S “ SAFE ” PILL?.— With all of
Warner s Safe Remedies ” use enough of
“ Warner's Safe Pills” to ensure one or two
bowel movements daily, otherwise but partial re-
sults will be obtained. They are purely vegetable,
do not gripe, and are gentle and effective in action.
They are compounded on the formula of a success-
ful British army physician in India, and are the
Best and Safest Pills in the market. JVb other pills
can be safely substituted for them.
“NON-SECRET” SUBSTITUTBS.-As you value
your health shun all v ie so-called “non-secret”
preparations. They are not made by your local
chemist, although his name may be on the
wrapper, but are furmshed him ready-made and
wrapp d from America. The chemist daro not say
he knows their contents. He onlv handles them
because he can make a greater profit than on legiti-
mate goods. These goods are “played out,” to
use an Americanism, where best known. An at-
tempt is now being made to foist them on a con-
fiding public In the colonies. We warn you in all
sincerity to have nothing whatever to do with
them
BE NOT DECBlYKD.—Unscrupulous dealers
when asked for Warner's Safe Remedies, if
they happen to have none on hand, wiilendeavour
to palm off soumthlDg ofjtheir own, or some other
medicine on their custome-, which they will say is
just as good. Have nothing to do with such men.
They make more on their own preparations is the
reason they offer them in place of Warner’s Sate
Remedies, which have been proved and are known
to do exactly as represented. If the chemists’ pre-
parations are just as good, why have they not long
ago cured Bright’s Disease, Diabetes, and many
other diseases considered incurable by the schools ?
Be not deceived; insist on having what you ask
tor. If your chemist ,will not trouble himself to
get it for you, visit some other shop, and transfer
your trade to a gentleman, and one who respects
your wishes and opinions.
DIABETES CAN BE CURED with Warner’S
Safe Diabetes Cure (another preparation from
Warner’s Safe Cure). Diabetes is a most alarming
disease, ana unless taken promptly in hand there
is no cure. Do not tnfl a with untried medicines,
but at once procure Warner’s Safe Diabetes
Cure. It has permanently cured when all the
schools and their medicines have failed. If there
is no sediment in your urine, if it is a pale straw
colour, if you are inordinately thirsty, if you make
more than 3 pints of water in 24 hours, you have
the symptoms of Diabetes. B 3 wise in time. Do
not neglect this terrible disease.
If troubled with business cares and oyer-
work, indulge In Wolfe’s Schnapps.
It is noble to do one’s duty, however lowly
it may be ; and Lord Tennyson says, “It is only
noble to be good.” Tried by these standards,
there is a celebrated crockery establishment in
this city who will not be found wanting in noble-
ness. The address is 103 and 401 George-street. and
the name, Bray Brothers.

BY FLOOD AND FIELD .
Without preliminary paper warfare, the
boxers ‘ Professor” Jackson and Michael Dooley,
have arranged to meet In a five-round encounter,
Queensberry rules, next Saturday night, at Foley’s
Hall. Boxing matches between the lesser lights
of the ring have been plentiful as blackberries
during the past few months, but t v e meeting be-
tween the two big-’uns will, no doubt, prove the
event of the season. Jackson, we believe, is the
more scientific of the pair, but he now scales over
13 stone, and his occupation of hotelkeeper is
all against his being in anything like con-
dition. Dooley, on the contrary, is in very
good “kip,” and if he hangs on to the “Pro-
fessor” for three or four rounds, condition
should tell its tale, and the fifth round
prove more equal than any of its predecessors.
Jackson, who is a regular giant, graduated from
the Foley stable, and Dooley, a fine young six-
footer, little more than out of his teens, scaling
some 11 stone and a half in condition, has
been under Foley's eye for some months past, and
the meeting between two such big—and better
still—good men, may be looked forward to with
more than usual interest. Going from the “Jum-
bos” to l he “Bantams,” Murphy, the NZ. light
weight, the other night gave forth that he was
willing to meet Jack Hall, but we do not
think there 1s any occasion for the Maori
to fly at such high game, as George Powell is
now in Sydney and eager for the fray. Peter
Jackson also has a “novice,” who, we dare say,
would like to try his hand at knocking the stuffing
out of Mr. Murphy. We have seen a few “ flash ”
boxers in our time, but Mr. Murphy is, without
doubt, the rowdiest piece of goods we ever saw
don the mittens. However, should he ever drop
in for a very bad quarter of an hour with one of
the Sydney lightweights, the Maoiilander maybe
persuaded to see the error of his ways.
♦ ■ ♦
At Foley’s Hall, George-street, oh Satur-
day night, there was an unusually large attend-
ance, the fancy fight of the evening being the
battle between young Hall and Fogarty. Frank
and a friend opened the ball with a fast four
rounds spin, and were followed by Waller and
Murphy, the New Zealand light-weight, who seems
to look upon the sport of the ring as something of
a farce, though some smart work was got in by
both. Young Fuller and a darkey fought four
rounds in favour of the white man. Nolan and
Frank, two old antagonists, sparred a couple of
lively rounds, and the latter, by way of showing
his satisfaction with the sport, threw a few active
somersaults round the ring. This innovation may
be the dawning of a new era in boxing, the pre-
cursor of a general game of ground and lofty
sparring, with the free use of the trapeze as
a get-away from fast fighting. Foley, who
seems to have a knack of picking up cham-
pions, had a four rounds’ bout with a Taree
knocker-out who at the end of the battle
was no longer champion of Tare©. Hall and
Fogarty’s entrance to the ring induced the ap-
plause of the audience, who knew the former had
laid £3O to £2O on the fight and was set to win.
Ml through the mill he had just a little the best of
it, land the referee declared at the finish in his
favour. Jack Thompson, who filled the somewhat
thankless office of judge, is too thorough a
soortsman to make any mistake. The demonstra-
tion of dissatisfaction which followed his declara-
tion in favour of Hall were altogether uncalled
for. Dave Ingram officiated as master of cere-
monies.

It looks bad when the workman begins to
find fault with his tools. Hanlan is credited with

The intercolonial eight-oar crew were out
for a spin on the Parramatta on Saturday, Mr.
Wimble taking the seat of Mr. Johnson, who was
resting. It was the second time the men had been
together in the eight fitted up under Mr. Brett’s
supervision, and, as might be expected, they would
not stand a microscopic inspection. A big mistake
is being made in one of the eight coaching the crew,
and we hope for alteration before it is too late.
Mr. Brett is all that his adrdrers claim for him—a
thorough “general,” a finished oarsman, and
second to none amateur or professional, in filling
up a crew, but even such qualifications as these
cannot be of service to him when rowing number
two as on Saturday last, and attempting to coach
bow, Mr. Robertson, who requires as much look-
ing after as any man in the boat. The Victorians
have finally picked the following eight:—Stroke,
R. D. Booth, 13»t.; 7. C. A. Champion, list. 121 b.;
6. C. A. P- Moline, list 10st.; 5. A. Charnley, 12at.
3lb. 1 S- H. Gowdle, list ; 3. W, Leverett. list,
lib.; 3. F. J. Taylor, 10st 101 b.; bow, E. R. Ainley,
lOst. slb. The full weight of the crew is 91st. lib.,
and the average is therefore 115t.5%1b.; the stroke
oars weigh in the aggregate 45st. 61b, and the
bows 45st. 91b.; so that the two sides should be
splendidly balanced as regards power. Of this
crew “Visor,” in the Australasian, says:—
“ with respect to the personnel of seven of the
crew, there is no doubt the committee could not
have done much better, and it is a pity they should
have made a mistake in the choice of the eighth.
F. J. Tavlor. No. 3, rowed bow in the 1884 crew,
and No. 3 in April last, and, though his form is
good, his rowing this year is not up to the stan-
dard of his comrades, as it is wanting in the essen-
tials of life, dash, and power, and he himself in
stamina. Every man‘goes off ’ occasionally, and
this is apparently the case with Mr. Tayior at the
present time.” As usual, the Oxford and Cam-
bridge eights knock spots of the colonial crews
for “ beet.” The former scales 97st. and the
latter totals 96st. 131 b.

Frank Smith’s Botany Handicaps have
kept on the improving list since his first effort, and
the one concluded on Saturday last outstripped
any of its predecessors. Mr. Smith, we hear,
netted abo -it £3OOO on his elaborately organised
venture. The hackneyed “glorious uncertainty
of the turf ” might well give place to the “ glorious
uncertainty of the Sheffield Handicap.” for it is
far more difficult to name the winner of a Sheffield
Handicap than to “place” the horses in a Mel-
bourne Cup. Joe Byrne F. Rogers
(13yds.), G. G. Whitney (13yds.), and M. Morrissey
(14yds.), were left in the final, Whitney being
looked upon as “amoral” at 7to 4 on. Twenty
yards from home the unthought of 30 to 1 chance
(Byrne) came away from the field and beat Rogers
by a couple of yards, Whitney, a yard away, third,
and Morrissey brought up the rear.

Matthews, the Yankee boxer, who worked
the free ad. racket to death in N.Z, and Australia,
is up to his old tricks in America. At latest he
was out with a challenge to box John L. Sullivan,
but there is no occasion to strike for such high
gam», as Jack Bourke c ffers to fight all comers,
bar Sullivan, for £lOOO or £3OOO aside. Be cheap
advertising, Dempsey, the American slogger,
managed to have no less than 156 challenges in-
serted in Yankee papers last year, which moun-
tain of' defls gave birth to but one poor little
mouse of a fight.

A marvellous jump was made by Patch-
work while being schooled at Cheltenham (Vic)
a week or so ago. Fred Hill was the rider, and
the leap seemed such a wonderful one that a tape
was immediately obtained, and it was found to be
no less than 35ft. Sin. Chandler’s celebrated jumn
at Leamington steeplechases on Match 33, 1817,
was 37ft.

The Albury steeplechase proved rather a
lively affair. Excelsior broke his neck at the first
jump and gave J. Smith a severe shaking; The

destroyed ; and Dispatch came a cropper—
Gardiner and Douglas, the respective riders,
escaping with a few bruises. £lB was collected

Now that critiques appear so often in the
papers respecting the performances of a certain
well-known Melbourne pugilist, it has been in-
cumbent upon the man of muscle to acquire the
science of reading, and he has therefore ergaged
the services of the Ballarat Chicken until such
a time as he (the prominent pug ,) shall be able to
collar and throw with great violence a complete
number of Bell’s Life in London. We were the
great boxer’s tutor once when he was a member
of the crowd at a certain No. 3 theatre and de-
lighted the elite of Christchurch with his classical
and elegant performance of Charles the Wrestler.
We forget the passage just now, but we think be-
fore tackling Orlando Charles’s lines are as follow:
Step forth, that I may cast thee to the birds
That chirrup on the branches.
Our pupil studied these (or the other) lines for six
months, but the nearest he could ever get to them
was “Come on with ycz,” whien used to gain him
three rounds of apolause every evening. We
took a lot of pains with the young man, but it was
of no use. B O X—box he learned beautifully;
but wnen informed that SOCKS was sox, ne
thought Universes were leagued together to
prevent his ever being a soholard. We left, we
remember, without creating a disturbance.

When it became known that L. Abrams,
the hon. sec. of the Junior C. A. had sent in bis
resignation (the supposed reason for so doing
being that he was disappointed at not being
elected manager of the N.S.W. Junior Eleven) a
great many scouted the idea of there being any
earnestness in his action. And the result of the
proceedings on the 17th inst. at the special meet-
ing of delegates proved these anticipations to be
correct, as when he found that plenty ethers
could be found to fill the post he did not require
much persuasion to withdraw his resignation.

The late Mayor of Sydney said at the end
of last season that the footballers would be alio wed
to commence business a month earlier than usual
this year. But this, it now seems, is not to be;
the junior cricketers are to occupy Moore Park
nine months out of the 13.

Judging from the recent selection of a
captain for the M.C.C. representative Australian
Eleven it would appear that a candidate for the
captaincy must have “the gift of the gab” as
well as a knowledge of the game. What show has
the gentlemanly Alick B. or the sociable Joey
Paimer of ever gaining this coveted honour?

The Sydney football clubs playing the
Australasian game all promise to be very much
stronger next season than they were last. A

Our own Miller and the immortal Donald
Dinnie are small potatoes in the weight-lifting
department compared with Angelo Cardelia, of
Nevada. Angelo can lift a man of 2001 b. witn the
middle finger of his right hand The man has to
stand with one foot on the floor, then he stretches
out his arms at full length, and his hands are
grasped by two persons to preserve his equili-
brium. When he is fixed in that interesting atti-
tude, Angelo puts his finger under the elevated
foot, and lifts the man 4ft. in the air. Whether
the two “supporters” give any assistance, on the
sly, we shouldn’t like to say. The remarkable
thing about these men of muscle, though, is that
they can raise anything in reason—except capital.

It has been suggested that at the beginning
of each season the Mikados o* the Cariingford
Cricket Club should be furnished by the secre-
taries of the other clubs with a list of names, and
asked to tick off those against whom they objected
to play. This would save the waste of much time
during matches ; it would also protect the delicate
nerves of the noblemen belonging to the club
named from much unnecessary tension.

. A peculiar circumstance worth recording
happened in connection with the match between
the second eleven of the Marrickville and Bt.
Peter’s Surry cricket clubs, played at Marrickville
on 13th inst. neynolds, a player on the former
side, went in third wicket down, and although he
carried out his bat and saw over 50 runs added to
the total, he, curiously enough, did not get a
single “ strike.”

Some of the worthy patrons of Australian
trotting races may congratulate themselves upon
the moderation of the public. A scandalous
swindle was perpetrated at Blsternwlok Park last
week in a so-called trotting “ match.” The leading
man deliberately pulled up his horse in order to
let tbe other fellow win, and was promptly dis-
qualified by the stewards “ for all time.” The riff-
: aff who attend trotting races in England make it
uncommonly warm for this class of sportsman,
and no one whi-i valued his health would attempt
such a barefaced pud as that at Biaternwick It is
a pity that these miserable barneys arc allowed to
form pare ui au otherwise buhaets-like pro-
gramme.

How many races are annually thrown
a way through the jockeys “ drawing it too fine ? ”
At Blsternwick P*rk (Vic.), on Bt. Patrick s Day,
a case in point nearly occurred. In the Share-
holders’ Cup, O’Brien only brought up his mount,
Gardenia, just in time to make a dead heat with a
tlree-year-o'd named Achmet. It was a palpable
case of waiting- too long, and In the run off, Gar-
denia, with odds of 3to 1 on, won easily. One of
the most accomplished jockeys in England—Tom
Cannon -is constantly losing races by a short
head, owing to his weakness for an “artistic
finish.”

The Eclipse Stakes of £lO,OOO, to be run at
San down Park, in July, is evidently regarded by
backers as an event in which they can depend on
a straight run for their money. Some weeks back
it appears that three horses were backed at even
money against the field. The great gun, St.
Gatien, was one of the selected trio.

Sir William Clarke’s small stud must be
about the worst paying portion of his vast pro-
perty. Even at such a minor meeting as Kyneton
the rich Bart.’s representatives contrived to get
badly beaten in three events. Tf he really takes
any interest in the sport, the Victorian Croesus
might lay out a little of his “sugar” in blood
stock before he returns from England. It is one
of a rich man’s privileges that he can, with good
luck, buy a horse that will make his name famous,
if nothing else. The sporting world of future
generations will speak of Vanderbilt, for instance,
as the owner of Maud S. Although his money
didn’t make the mare to go, it bought the mare
when she did go, hence his name will always be
irradiated by a sort of reflected equine glory.
Wealthy mediocrities should remember this.

The Balmain R.C.’s annual regatta came
off on Saturday last, on the noble sheet of water
in front of the club. Maiden double-sculls, junior
and senior fours, senior pair oars, and maiden
fours were gone through, and J. Langley, A.
Eraser, and J. H. Bead, faced the music for the
president s cup, rowed in outriggers. J, Langley
rowed in really good form, and fed from start to
finish. The trophy has to be won three times.
Mr Langley has now two wins to his credit, and
should he retain his present form, he is pretty
sure to finally annex the trophy.

Says an English paperPeall, the bil-
liardist, who already holds more records than any
otner player, has added another to his list. In
antagonising Roberts in a game of 13,000 up, spot
barred, the champion presented him with 4000
start. Peall sho wed rather indifferent form in the
afternoon, but made amends for this later on in a
break of 330, making all but 98 without the assis-
tance of the white ball, or 233 off the red. This
completely put the previous beat in the shade,
Roberts haviag subscribed 156 when playing
Joseph Bennett last year, and tnus Peall has added
66 on the record.

“As for love,” wrote Disraeli, when a

Marrying for love is a guarantee of infelicity.”
"Beauty unadorned’s adorned the most,”
he whispered as they courted, and he looked at
her simple frock. And she believed him, and
thought it was the most lovely line ever written
by a poet. But her faith in that line wont out

illustrated it by pawning all her jewellery.

from their desks during the day a half-crown fine is
imposed; their meals are served to them at their
posts; they are responsible for any deficiency in
the cash; and for this genteel slavery they receive

The utmost depth of woman’s curiosity
was fully satisfied in a country district of Tas-
I mania the other day. An old man who had occu-
pied a hut for many years was missed from hia
usual haunts, and the door of his habitation was
found to be securely fastened from the Inside
Many guesses were hazarded as to his probable
fate, and the local police were as dilatory as usual
about acting in the matter. The nearest neigh-
bour-a woman (possessing even more curiosity
than most of her sex)—determined to have a pri-
vate Investigation on her own account. She pro-
cured a ladder, rested it against the wall of the
dilapidated shanty, mounted it, and thrust her
head through an opening in the roof, thereby
finding herself face to face nearly touching the
missing man,;who hid hanged himself to a rafter.
Her descent of the ladder broke all previous re-
cords.
A London story. A was a young man in a
horse regiment who fell in love with B, the
daughter of an opulent merchant. He grew tired
of her, and when his regiment was ordered to the
Bast, he left her without explanation. Return-
ing home with more dust than medals on his coat
dined and went to a ball, where B was the
daintiest among the beauties. They danced, and
she showed no resentment on the score of past
faithlessness. Pressed by A* she gave him an
appointment at a certain church near her father’s
house, which had been their trysting-place in
other days. A went happily to his club, and his
old friend Major C offered him a cigar. “I met
Lucy B this evening,” said A, and ho toldt-his
friend of the appointment she had given him.
The major expressed no surprise, but said that
Lucy was a good and forgiving girl—for he knew
what had gone before. A went to the church on
the day named, and there was a wedding. When
the ceremony was over, B, the bride, came out of
the church on the arm of Major 0, the bridegroom.
A went home to his lodgings.
r ‘ Jl arr y Lynch, of the Bellringers,
seems, by reason (we suppose) of his multitude
nous fascinations, to have “ got round ” the
Sunny Corner Press-edited by a lady-in a par-
ticumr.y emphatic manner. The critique upon
the performance of the troupe is a little under a
column in length, and of a pleasantly discursive
nature. It prates pleasantly of Mr. Harry Lynch’s
love for Australia” (innocent, of course, of
that warriors quite recently-expressed passion
tor the gunyahl), and accounts for his being
' heart-whole ’ because of his “ not stopping long
enough in one place to have it lacerated.” After
this, all doubts as to the sex of the writer are at
once at an end I Had the copy contained a few
more adjectives, and a trifle of alliteration, we
should have shut our eyes and shrieked out,
Carcoar Mary I ” We must own, however, that
after ssch a high-toned phrase as "Neither is it a
case of a woman being at the bottom of Mr.
Lynch’s love,” it savours rather of bathos to
nnd the company described as a “ steady respectful
JpL the more especially as their performance of
" Home, sweet Home,” with variations, " filled the

There is trouble and tumult up at Sunny
Corner, N S W., and it’s all on account of that
paper of which Mrs. Agnes B. M'Donald states
with pardonable pride that she is editress and pro-
prietress. Like most editors of the female per-
suasion she runs the paper on “ we-don’t-care-a-
cuss-for-anyone ” lines. Strange thing this, isn’t
It ? Set a meek and merciful woman up as chief
engineer of a paper and she will at once gather up
her skirt and run amuck of one-half of the world,
while she deluges the other moiety with an
avalanche of slobber. Bather Walsh has under-
gone the latest scrunching at the hands of the
lovely Agaes. She caught the unsuspecting man,
hammered him with leading articles, and then
mangled him up with paras raphs. So that is the
reason why the clouds of conflict overhang the
enterprising township of Mitchell. It is alleged
that, unable to withstand the force of the Silver
Press leaders, Bather Walsh has given a free and
effective ad. to the paper by forbidding any of his
flock to take it, but still the wrath of the editress
la not appe sed, and it is certain, from the tone of
her latest issue, that nething less than the head of
the offending priest in a soup-plate will be counted
as atonement. We look for further development
with much interest. Unless a speedy settlement
is obtained matters at Sunny Corner will be as in-
teresting and lively as morning service in a Graf-

In reference to a scheme of naval defence which
might be applied to Great Britain and her colonies
taken as a whole, the following proposal of the
Montreal branch of the Imperial Federation
League is not the least worthy of consideration.
Its terms are that a duty of 5 per cent, should be
imposed by the colonies and Great Britain on
foreign goods of all kinds, over and above the or-
dinary Customs tariff, the amount thus raised to
be devoted to the maintenance of an Imperial
navy for the common defence. It is calculated
that under this scheme the colonies would pay 10
per cent, of the annual cost of the navy.

Then a certain irrepressible blatherskite stepped
forward and called for “cheers for Her Majesty the

well an feeble cheers. Some people thought the
groans were for the Queen, but they were mis-

“Editor Bulletin.—Can you tell me
what are the opinions of the Sydney Daily Tele-

Tne poorer clergy of the Anglican Church
in Bogland have addressed a memorial to the
Archbishop of Canterbury, which shows that the
central principle of Socialism has entered the
sanctuary. The memorial calls, In brief, for a
reduction in the anomalies of the present distri-
bution of the endowments of the Church. The
Archbishop is inclined to give the document con-
sideration, but the rich clergy denounce It as a
revolutionary and criminal proposal. “If,” as one
of the rich ones argm s, “a highly-endowed living
is made to give up a portion to a lowly-endowed
living, how does this differ from requiring the rich
man to give up a part of his inheritance to the
poor one? If one is held to be confiscation, how
can the other be otherwise? ’ A s far as the rubs
of logic go the rich clergy have the better of It.
The poor clergy who want a share of the rich liv-
ings must begin by denying that the analogous
case is confiscation, or, admitting it to be so, must
maintain that confiscation of this kind Is
justifiable.

tear that the granting of Home Rule will be a
menace to Protestantism Is btst answered by the
quotation of an extract from the speech delivered
in the Commons a few weeks ago by the great
Irish leader. This is what Parnell says:—* We have
heard to-night of the necessity of protecting the
loyal minority in Ireland. I was born a Protes-
tant, I have always lived a Protestant, and I hope
to die a Protestant; and if in the future, after
the concession of the Iriih claims, any danger
were to arise to my Protestant fellow-country-
men 1 should bo the first to stand up for liberty
of speech, liberty of conscience, and the liberty to
live and whve to every section of the country;
and perhaps I might be a more effectual aid is
times of real danger than some gentlemen who
x 52 loudly and boast so much. lam convinced
that the Catholics of Ireland would not attempt
to oppress their Protestant fellow-countrymen,
put th <t they would desire that the Protestants ot
Ireland should have more than fair play—that
they would endeavour to bring them to the front,
t^'-m the fullest share in the Government
ot the country. The Catholics of Ireland are per-
fectly willing that any guarantees that the in-
genuity of men can frame for the protection of
the minority shall be framed and shall be put in
tores. Indeed, they would treat much more
justly and much more generously the Prote~-
tants in regar 1 to their future reoresentation in
an Irish Cciamber than the Protestan’s of England
n ?u° have treated the two millions of
Catholics in respect to the representation in this
Imperial Parliament.’ ”
There was much to elad the heart of an

*B Probable that the “ applause ”
and cheers” will actually fill the intervals
assigned to them in the morning piper
reports. It was unfortunate for both Mr. Dailey
and Dan. O’Connor that they were so closely
associated at this banquet; for Dan. because he was
put into the shade by “the Australian orator”and
his brightest flashings of rhetoric made to appear
only as the faint glimmer of a slush lamp, and un-
fortunate for William Bede as it showedlthat he
was after all only a “ single-handed pitcher” of the
U Connor type but rather more so. And each was
heavily handicapped by circumstances. Dailey

(whose name by the way caused the company to
cheer deliriously), and Dan. because the brothers
Kadmond came In for adulatory comment. The
star of the evening undoubtedly was Mr. H. Cope-
ian>_ xI 3 h* B speech he claimed the applause as a
tribute to the Ministry, but in so doing he was
over-modest,—it was an acknowledgement of his
own popularity. Mr. Lysight, the Illawarra
statesman, was observed to sit down during the
toast of the Ministry, a circumstance which pro-
bably gave rise to the rumour that he was to take
the vacant portfolio. He would undoubtedly give
much weight-about 30 stone of it—to the Cabinet.
Mr. Hy. Daly made a creditable debut on this
occasion, and if he did say “that we never recog-
nise the virtues of our own patriots during their
lifetime till long after they are dead,” this was
probably only to be regarded as a lapsus linguae.
Mr Coonan s humour hardly came off, but Aider-

Strangely enough neither G. A. Lloyd, Henson,

A Sydney Sunday paper asks, “ Do people
not know that all Is not gold that glitters, and that
many diamonds are but paste after all ?” Well, of
course, people know, miners,anyway, that nothing
which '‘glitters” is gold, hut they have yet to
learn that diamonds are paste. If paste they can-
not be diamonds, and on the contrary:—
Doar holy howl, dear Sunday prig,
Do not your youthful judgment waste,
Or people may your own drift “ twig ”
And charge you with being shears and “paste.”
May say ydur coruscations fine,
Though new to you. to them are old;

Over the Adelaide bank failure, the Dr.
Jetferis, LL.B., of the Congregational Church,
Pitt-street, Sydnev. is great indeed. He writes to
say he ‘ sold his 200 shares a few weeks ago with-
out knowing the bank was in difficulties of any
sort.” Well, now, supposing the reverend gentle-
man had known. What then ? The transaction
mightn't have been strictly Christian, but it would
have been good business. The strongest lay pillars
of Congregationalism wouldn’t have bucked at
such a*■ deal.” It would have been legal enough.
What’s the use of a Divine Providence unless it
interposes to allow the followers of the meek and
lowly Nazarene (who “knew not where to lay his
head,” and who told people to “sell all their
goods and give to the poor”) to trade off the scrip
that’s going bung ? Let no one dare to paraphrase
the words of the immortal William: “Methinksthis
lady doth protest too much.” Dr. Jefferls is an
exponent of the religion which, according to
I literal and old-fashioned notions, teaches a man to
do to his neighbour as he would his neighbour did
to him. The reverend doctor can make restitution
to the poor devil who bought the 200 shares—nay,
from what we know of Dr. Jefferis we are quite
sure he ins already done so. The clergy care not
for the things of this sinful world, it is quite
enough for Dr. Jeff eris (who has £lOOO a y ear or so at
Pitt-street chapel) to "lay up treasure in Heaven”
where there is no rust to lessen the weight of the
British sovereign, and where the moth eateth up

His Excellency and Lady Carington held
their first evening' relation on Tuesday, the 16th
inst., when about 603 guests assembled id the
reception rooms of Government House. The
carriages began to arrive about half-past 9 and
continued till past 10. Lady Carington looted
lovely in a trained robe of embossed white silk,
the bodice anl draperies being richly trimmed
with crystal and silver drops. A triple tiara of
diamonds with necklace and bracelets of the same
gems, were her jewels. The Hon. Judith Har-
bord’s very becoming gown was of white crepe
striped with a peculiar shade of pink very hand-
somely trimmed with lace. Tulle, as usual, was the
predominating material, while the 11 >wered tulles
were, perhaps, the most effective gowns in the
room. Among such a large assemblage it was very
difficult to notice many. Lady Martin looked ex-
tremely well in dull gold bodice and tram, with
lace petticoat; Lady Jenninsrs was becomingly
attired in white silk; Mrs. C. J. Kobcrts, in black
lace with del blue aigrette on the corsage, diamond
ornaments; Miss Roberts, in all white, looked
childish; Mrs. Airey, la a soft silk of the new
shade of prawn pink, with straw-c floured maltese
lace; Mrs. Trickett, in pale blue; Mis S. A. Joseph,
in tobacco-brown gros gi?kia mixed with bro-
cade; Miss Joseph looked nice in a combination
of pale pink and olive green; Mrs. Purves in
white molrS, handsomely embroidered with white
satin beads; Mss Hill looked nics in flowered
tulle over white satin; Mrs. Sah), pale pick mer-
vellleux, beaded with gold; Mias Fosbery looked
well in white satin and tulle; Mrs.Gutlett. in green
velvet mixed with white brocade; Mrs. Fischer, in
black lace, embroidered with bsetif s wings. M :st
of the Defence forces were represented. Among the
gay toilettes of the ladies, the uniforms of the
Sydney Lancers, the Royal Artillery, the German
Squadron, the Fnglish navy, the Permanent Ar-
tillery, and other uniforms, were thrown out In
great relief. The night was very tine, and the
verandahs were covered in, and lounging chairs
were placed everywhere. Refreshments were
served in the dining room all the evening.

Admiral Tryon held his first “ At Home ”
since his return from Hobart, on Friday last, when
about 500 guests assembled on board H M.S. Nel-
son. The ship was biautlfully decorated with
flags, flowers, and evergreens. Refreshments
were laid in the gun-rcom, whe'e everything to
tempt even a delicaie palate could be obtained.
Dancing was kept up from 3 to 6 o clock, with
great vigour, and the extensive decks of the Ne'-
son were thoroughly appreciated by those wor-
shippipg at the shrine of Terpsichore. The day
being very oppressive, ight toi ettes were mostly
chosen. White predominated, and were thrown
out in great relief to the light pinks, blues, and
duller and richer silks and brocades donael by
most of the matrons. Lady Martin’s very hand-
some black, composed of moire and lace, looked
well; Lady Manning also wore black; Mrs
Busby wore a light brown costume ; Mrs.
Labertouche. a handsome gown of black,
with very richly-jstted mantle; Mrs C. J. Roberts
looked very well indeed in a combination of white
lawn Valenciennes lace, with pale blue moire loops
at the side, and a tiny pale blue tulle bonnet;
Mrs. M'Quade wore one of the moat elegant c >s-
stumes on board, it being composed of a cull sage-
green gros grain, made with a z uave jacket,
and richly trimmed with gold ana silver Indian
embroidery; Mrs. Purves wore a striking costume
of cigar-brown canvas, with panels of stee), blue
moire silk, bonnet to match ; Mrs. Airey loosed

brown velvet, bonnet to match; Mrs. Saeppard
Laidley, in a stylian costume or cream canvas,
over salmon-pink silk, kilting ot the silk peeping
out from under the draperies; Miss Manning, in
cream lace over cream satin ; Miss Clara
Manning, in a simple frock of white tasas

in soft white ti'k with handsome embroidery;

pale pink zephyr, white vest, black velvet collar
and cuffs, ana high hat; the Misses Mirtin, in blue

stripes; Miss B. Danne in cream striped crepe,
small white tulle bonnet; Miss A. Denne, also in
cream; Miss Darley looked stylish in coffee tam-
bour muslin with trimmings of orange velvet,
gold net and coffoe-ooloured velvet nat; Miss

die wore very ladylike costumes of brown, ana all

with handsome jewellery; Mrs Squier, In striped
silk, trimmed with velv-t; Miss Holborrow, ia a
pretty dress of cr~am lace; Miss Wardell. in deep

ohry, io cream, with lace, small white tulle bon-

officers of the man-of-war ships now in port, also
members of the Permanent Artillery and Volun-
teers were present. The wh fle was a very
brilliant scene, and one not likely soon to bo for-
gotten.

The Sydney Owls held their annual Garden
Party at Botany list Thursday, where they
amused thems Ives by dancing aad singlog, and
eating oysters, till 7 o’clock, when they s it ao wn
to an innocent kind ot banquet, after which the
popular president, Dr. Byrne, speeohed and laid
down a rule that no soeech (alter ais) wis to last
over two minutes and a haif-m.-rciful ralel But
the gentleman who responded to tae “Lubes,”
bad so muci to say about them, that he took
double his all flted time to get through. ‘ Time,”
was shouted out to Dim repeatedly, but he was so
interested in what he was saying, that to e very-
thing else he was pe fectly obliv.ou I ’. Mr. Bailey
responded for the “Press” and said as much lu
his two minutes as it took the previous man to
say in double the time. Mr. Tair, the vice-presi-
dent, had somet ring to say which was conci.e and
to the point, and then dancing was resorted to,
much to the delight of the ladies, who, it is need-
less to say, lot ked charming in their tasteful cos
tutnes A few vocal contributions varied the
entertainment, and W. H. L. was again to the fore
as a singist. Mr. Maurice Metser busied himself
as usual in looking after everybody’« comfort, and
the pleasant gathering broke up at 11 p.m.

Sydney, W ednesday.
Dearest Belle,—So many events have been
crowded into this past week that my memory is
slightly congested, and only the very brightest re-
main unforgotten. There was Leon Caron’s
benefit concert, on Friday night, at the Masonic
Hall, which, if it hadn’t taken three hours to get
through, instead of two, as we were promised,
would have been quite delightful. I haven’t, nor
never shall have, any patience with concert-
givers who so absurdly miscalculate the time it
takes to get through a programme as to be nearly
a whole hour out Still,! it was a nice con-
cert, and the audience brilliant and aporgeia-
tive. Ther ilsa good doal of real solid music in
Caron's quartette in E flat, which opened the con-
cert, and was played by Messrs. Kreitehman,
All press, Patek, and Caron, and the pitv of it is
that so good a musician should have met with so
little success in Sydney, that it has ended in
his leaving us altogether. I can’t say I admire
him much as a violin soloist, but may bo I am
hard to please on that point. All I know is,
that his tone doesn’t thrill me like that of Kruse
or Wilhelmj, neither does the music he evokes
carry my thoughts right away to other spheres,
where milliners’ bills, and such like annoyances
are not. But a man can’t be first-cla's at every-
thing, and his various musical compositions are
quite sufficient to brand him a man of talent
if not of genius. Mias Acton Blair sang “ Forget n
really nicely, and Cissie—l mean Cyril de Val-
mency (there's a name for you I) played a difficult
setting of “ William Tell ” rather laboriously. The
young Auckland boy shouldn’t attempt such heavy
solos yec awhile, for he p-sitively hasnt strength
enough to play them; if he would only keep to
what is well within his powers, he would be quite
nice. Ha was showered with bouquets after his
solo, which caused him to blush depply and to
play another solo. I could have forgiven him the
blushing, but ha really shouldn’t have played*
such a terribly long piece for an encore. Oh, theT
we had Signora Fabris, who was simply splendid.
Her solo was ‘‘ I Vespri Sicilian, with orchestral
accompaniment, which was, of course, encored.
The Signora s voice is as full and fresh as ever,
Madame Kellermann next came on and played a
“ Polonaise,” by Henry Herg, with string accom-
paniment, in her own graceful and charming
style, and after being recalled repeated a portion
of It. Mr. Hallewell’s name was on the pro-
gramme, but the man—where was he ? Not at the
concert, certainly, so Madame Merz filled up the
gap, but we would have been equally pleased
i. it hadn’t been filled at all. This isn’t
meint as a reflection on Madame's singing,
but it grew so iate, you know. The second
part of the programme consisted of the Garden
scene from ‘ Faust,” with Signora Fabris in the dual
parts of Irebeland Marta; MissSaville, Marguerite;
Charles Harding, Faust; and Warwick Gainor as
Mephlstopheles. The scenery was a bit (a good bit)
amateurish, but on the whole the scene was fairly
given, and then, you know, it was a novelty for a
concert hall. George said Miss Saville looked
scrumptious as Marguerite, so I suppose she did,
but you know men are far more appreciative of
women’s looks than we of the same sex, but Mr*
Harding really did look nici as Faust, quite hand-
some, I assure you. There were a few hitches; for
instance, the spinning wheel refused to go, and
gave Margusrlte an Immense deal of trouble, ans
sometimes Faust forgot his part, but these things
don’t count for much when the audience is good
We were requested, on the pnogrammep,
■ i keep our during the rendering of the
National Anthem, but we are such creatures of
habit taut no sooner was the first note struck than
up we all jumped like good true loyal subjects as
we are Oa.ic has just occurred to me that we
were not meant to Keep our seats, but simp y to re-
frain from rushing out of the hall during the
Anthem, as we are much given to doing at the end
of a long concert, but it was a funny way to put
it, wasn t it? That Anthem cost many people
n arly a halt hour’s wait tor their train that night.
L?,dy Cariogton’s first social evening, which she
gave on the 16th inst., wai a very nice affair, not
wonderfully brilliant, but pleasant for all that. Go-
vernment House is ridiculously imnll for enter-
taining purposes. Indeed it is imp :s hie to c m-
f riably entertain more than about 601) people at
one time, consequently invitations were issued for
two separate nignts. 1 rather expected that some
of our leading artists would have been engaged to
help entertain the company, but was disap-
po'n 'od, as ihere was simply a banc, conversation,
and refreshments. After all, though, there are no
very big shining lights among us just now. Lady
Carington looked graceful as usual in a pure white
gown much trimmed with lace, and wore her hair
pressed high. By the way, I have only once seen
her wearing the basket pla'ts at the back of her
head, and that was when she was in riding cos-
tume. I need hardly tell you, dear, that, select as
the company was supposed to be, the trades—
wealthy trades, of course, I mean—played a rather
prominent part. Personally, as you know, I
naven’tthe slightest objection to hotelkeepers’
wives and shopkeepers’ families, for there’s no
reason why they shouldn’t be quite as nice as other
people; we get occasional skocks from their gram-
mar, and sometimes they are terribly puree proud,
but, on the whole, their hearts are as good as ours.
But it is such nonsense to class them with the
upper ten, isn’t it? I don’t think the “weeding
out” at Government House has been quite suc-
cessful.
It is said that the crowds of psopl« who Hocked
to St. Margaret's to see Miss Mary Gladstone
married to Mr. Harry Drew, went more with’ the
intention of catching a glimpse of the grand old
man than with the idea of seeing his daughter,
the bride. Now if I were a bride I shouldn’t
relish this at ail. It must be very nice to have so
celebrated a father, still a girl on her bridal day
hps a right to expect to be the show piece for that
day at least. The old man had to rush away from
bis state duties to give hiS daughter away, and
looked (so report has it) rather fagged and pen-
sive. The bride wore a plain white muslin dress
over silk, knd carried a huge bunch of snowdrops.
The Prinee and Princess of Wales and Georgia
were present at the ceremony. A great many of#
the bridal gifts were cheques for various amounts
—from £5O ;to £loo—one from Lord Rosebery
being for the latter sum. Talking of weddings
reminds me of an anecdote I heard the other day
about an absent-minded man. The ceremony waa
over and our hero departed for the honeymoon
amid tbe usual storm of congratulations. He was
just about to step into thj train when some one
exclaimed “ But wnere is your wife? ’ “Egad I”
he exclaimed, “I had quite forgotten her.”
Woufd you like to marry an absent-
minded man, dear ? I don’t think I should
if he acted like that. Further, apropos _ of
marriages: 1 suppose you know that hitherto a
marriage to be legal in England must be per-
formed before noon, unless, indeed, a year’s
licence is procured, but now it has been decided
to extend the hour to 4 p.m How glad English
girls ought to be for this change I A girl never
looks her best in the early morning, and then,
imagine what a terrible rush it must be to dress,
cry, and to admire one self in a full length mirror
all before 11 o’clock I Of course, here things ara
different, for; we can marry any hour we please.
The prettiest wedding 1 ever saw was at 8 o’clock
at night. The gas made everything look so brilliant
without cruelly showing up bad complexions litee
the sun does, and the bride in her white robes
looked a perfect picture. The fashionable time ia
England in future Is to be 3 p.m.
I saw a paragraph of gush in an English paper
yesterday in reference to a “ kindly ” and
“ gracious ” act on the part of Mrs. Macbay,
mother-in-law of Prince C donna, you know, who
has ordered the entire layette for the baby Prince
from the Ladies’Work Society of San Francisco,
of which She is directress. Well, it was rather
thoughtful of Mrs. Mackay, I admit; but dear
me, how very easy it must be to bo “ kindly ” and
“gracious” when one is rich I I don’t see that
she sacrificed herself oae bit in ordering all the
pretty things from this society, for according to
the desertion of the articles they are as
elaborately made as they would have been in the
most fashionable establishment in Paris. The
little blankets were particularly beautiful, and
were embroidered by an old lady over 70 years of
age. How her poor old eyes must have ached over
that work!
The officers of the Nelson have lost no time since
they have been in port, before commencing their
gaieties, for last Friday they gave an afternoon
dance. The ship was gaily cecorated, and dancing
kept up till after, sundown. The Bismarck was m
fete on Saturday afternoon, and on Sunday the
German waislrps bade usa noisy “good-bye,” and
left us.
That giddy young man, Mr. Quong Tart, enter-
tained all the lady cricketers one evening last
week at his rooms, in the Sydney Arcade, fhear
the young ladles enjoyed themselves immensely,
several of them singing solos and giving recita-
tion*, and their good-natured host sang his inevi-
table Scotch songs and made funny speeches. He
(Mr. Tart) is rather a long time in finding a bird to
put in tnat neat little cage of his at Wavcrley, but
I really hope he will catch one soon, for he is a
good fellow, although he does sing Scotch songs.
We intended to go to Herr Patek’s promenade
concert at the Exhibition building, last Saturday
night, but we were at a tennis party in the after-
noon, and were too tired when we got home to go
in quest of more amusement. I believe the cor-
cerc was attended by upwards of 900 people which
augers well for the future success of Her Patek's
enterprise. These concerts are to be a regular in-
stitution here, and as the admission is only js.
and 35., good music will be within everybody*
reach.
I have just this moment received a letter from a
dear little friend of mine whose family has lately
suffered reverses, asking me if I can use my influ-
ence. anywhere in obtaining for her the post of
nursery governess. Poor little thing I she little
knojys what she is asking for. A nursery governess
in this country is expected to teach English
thoroughly, French, German, music, including
singing and “Thorough Bass,’’ dancing, and calis-
thenics. She must also be an early riser, and in
the drawing-room two hours before breakfast and
superintend the practising not only of her own
pupils, but she must also burden herself with the
extra labour of helping the elder girls, who “ for
the name of it,” learn from a professor. She
will be expected to walk out with the chil
dren for a couple of hours each afternoon (
and lest she should have any spare time in
which to do a little sewing for herself, she is
required to be in the drawing-room playing ac-
companiments to any chance visitor till 11 p.m.
And all for what? Thirty guineas a year! So
really, without knowing it, colonial ladies require
a nursery maid who bus matriculated at the Uni-
versity and taken her dogre<>, or passed the Civil
service examination. Oh no, I have far too high
a regard for my friend to help her to a nursery
governess-ship. 11l just goaud nave a talk with
Ned, and see what can ba done for her, so now
gcod-bye.
Ever your loving

Wolfe’s Schnapps.
It was very thoughtful of Mr. Thomas
Robertson, the tailor, to leave a note beside his
dead body saying he had suicided. B it, owing to
the extreme unreliability of tailors, it Is behev d
by the police that either he was murdered or is
sti 1 alive
It was a little before half past 10 at night,
when he dashed into the grill-room at Oompag-
noni’s, and said, hurriedly- 1 ’ Walter, put me on
three chops, and bring me a whole Dutch cheese.
1 have just come from Government House, where
I have been ‘ entertaining myself witn conversa-
tion,’ but ail I was able to extract from the dining,
room was a curious goblet of lemon[julep and two
custard patties.” Here he swallowed a pickled
walnut. Looking up-to new arrival: “Hullo,
MacDoughl How did you get on? He merely
sat down with a groan, and said, faintly a.s he
divested himself of his light overcoat, Walter;
fl; e Welsh rabbits.”
Wolfe's Schnapps is a most comprehensive
preventive and remedy against all diseases.

certified to the purity of Wolfe’s Schnapps,

Marbles are out, as many a weary mother
knows to her joy, and the very latest game in-
vented is called “The Horse Sale.’ Cue boy
takes the role of auctioneer, another the horse-
owner, and all the rest, har one, stand round as
bidders, and enjoy the fan. The part of the horse
must be played by a boy who knows nothing
whatever about the business. Ignorance is as
essential for this as it is for a Civil service billet.
All things being arranged, the boy-horse is
c'refully blindfolded, one end of a rope is tied
to one of his ankles, and then, unknown to him
the other end is made fast to the door-knob of the
most irascible man about the neighbourhood.
The sale then commences in the orthodox fashion,
and when the biddings have topped the reserve,
the boy-horse is literally “ knocked down, and,
of course, the door-knob is considerably influenced
by the action. In the twinkling of a duck s foot
the gleeful gang are across the street gazing in-
tently at the fun. For an obvious reason, how-
ever, the boy-horse remains where he is, and as
he dances round on one leg, he involuntarily ham-
mers away at the door in a state calculated to
wake a whole pyramid full of Egyptian mummies.
This naturally leads the hot-headed householder
to infer that he is wanted on urgent business, ana
he accordingly sallies out with fire In his eyes,
and a yard of a stick in his hands. The last act or
the game is then played, and it frequently follows
that the boy-horse takes his meals standing up,
and sleeps face downwards for several weeks
after. Boys will be boys, however, and the best
plan to tempt them from their mischievous
is to take them along to Summerfleld and Co. a
and treat them to cheap, but firet-clais suit of

TOOTHACHE CORED IN 15 MINUTES,

Prahran, Melbourne,
33ad January, 1886.
The Chas. A. Yogeler Company.
Gentlemen,—l think it right to let you know the
effect of your oil in a case of Lumbago. About
three weeks since I had a very severe attack. I
poured a little oil into a saucer, damped a piece of
linen, and laid it across my lions; put a wet cloth
over that, and an oilskin over the whole. I then
lay down for about three quarters of an hour,
after which I got up, took tbe compress off,
washed my back with a little warm water, and the
result was that the Lumbago had completely gone.
Persons using St. Jacobs Oil will find the compress
much more effectual than rubbing.
The other night my servant was nearly mad with
tootache, and when she had exhausted her own
little stock of remedies without obtaining relief,
I took a few pieces of wadding, saturated them
with the oil, placed one bit in the tooth and the
other in the ear on the same side, and in fifteen
minutes she was comfortably asleep.
Y ours faithfully,

suffering humanity.
Some months since I was set upon by a bull
whilst crossing a paddock, knocked down, and
severely bruised about the body and legs, sustain-
ing an awlul bruise on the ankle, inflicted by his
horns whilst lying on the ground. The palnwasmost
excruciating, and, after making my escape, 1 tried
turpentine, oil, and all manner of remedies with-
out the slightest relief, until I applied bt. Jacobs
Oil. Almost instantly the pain left me, and the
swelling disappeared. I have since used it for
rheumatic pains in the knee and leg, and always
with the most beneficial result. In fact, whenever
lam in bodily pain of any kind I fly to St Jacobs
Oil, and give it now my heartiest recommendation.
Yes, I have used it for rheumatism, when I have
been nearly crippled, and found immediate relief.
Yours gratefully,

“ Charity-is kind. . . . envieth not.
. ... Is not puffed up. . . . thinketh no
evil.”—Paul. “ Alas for the rarity of Christian
charity I ’’—Hood.
The “impotent man ” had lain at the door
Of the “ orthodox ” temples full 40 years—
He had heard them chant of the golden shore.
Where the heavy laden may dry their tears.
He had heard them sing of the realms above
(From which “Dives” the rich man is sure y
barred), „ ‘ _
Whose Law is Mercy, whose God is Love,
But the strain somehow on his feelings jarred.
None pitied him, tear, prayer, mournful cry.
On each devotee were quite thrown away;
Their thoughts were so bent on the home on high,
Theylnegleeted their duty to man to pray.
With smoke from the altar their eyes are blear,
And dim with tears shed for Calvary 8 woes,
What care they for sorrows which lie so near
For poverty, want which offends the nose.
Falls many a coin in the church-door Plate
To grease a fat bishop or build a spire—
" Let Lazarus lie at the temple gate.
The heathen our services now require.
The bigot, “the orthodox ” passed him by,
“The old fashioned Christian of Puritan School
’Tis a creed hard, joyless, bare, and dry,
It has closed it's ears to the “ golden rule.
Your true bigot is hard as a piece of flint
His flesh and blood have petrified grown,
A fossilised figure of fleshly tint
With brains as of clay, and a heart of stone.
On Sunday, at home, see him saturnine sit
With a face as grim as a heathen god’s
Should an infant a laugh or cry emit,
For flogging, to-morrow, he piokleth rods.
Should a bird at his window try its throat
He scares it with gestures uncouth and wild—
“ln some other garden go pipe your note.
My premises shan’t be, by you, defil’d I”
Is your creed one wider than his at all—
He thirsts for your blood in a legal way.
And sighs for the hour when heads shall fall
On Puritan “St. Bartholomew’s Day.”
Should a pale-faced clerk or a draper dare
From a Sunday steamer to sniff the breeze,
Or walk round the gardens to get the air.
Then “ Praise-God-Barebones ” is on his knees.
He first gives thanks he’s so greatly blest;
Then tells how blasphemers profane God s day,
Suggests that they might be wiped out by a pest
He'll mark their door-posts in the good old way.
If a neighbour enjoys a Sunday weed
That man’s house, he foretells, God will waste
with fire;
Because some folks sing and play, ’tis decreed
That by earthquakes and smallpox we’ll all ex-
pire.
But “ Lazarus” still at the church door lies.
Unless the harsh bigot hath “run him in; ”
For no “ Hospital Sunday Fund” supplies
The needful to doctor this “ man of sin.”

A " certain Samaritan ” coming along
An infldel, mayhap, but yet humane,
Was stirred by sympathy, pure and strong.
And shocked at the sight of his fellow’s pain.
In those wounds to pour “ oil and wine ” he’s fain,
So appeal’d for succour to all true men
A rally he sounded with might and main
That was heard in the depths of the bigot’s den.
Like hornets disturbed, quick sallied out
~ Black Envy and Malice, his constant mate,
And took in their tra*n their five henchmen stout,
Persecution, Falsehood, Spite, Anger, Hate.
As they buzz'd ’bout his ears, loud hiss’d foul
Hate
“ For churchmen’s care let this suff'rer wait,
He’s ours, forty years hath he graced our gate.
To saints, ’tis presumptuous thus to dictate.
Astonished that right should be class'd as wrong
Samaritan paused, for a time, aghast,
Then seeing ’twas venom that moved tho throng
On his errand of mercy qu ckly passed.
And that teed that he sow’d sha'l grow apace
Unchecked by banning of bigot or priest;
Springs charity ne’er from that loveless race
Whose foreheads are stamp’d with “ the sign of
the Beast.”

Parted.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It’s over now between us two:
Ah, dear! I wonder why
You made me think you would be tru?,
As true to you was 1?
We part: there’s nothing now to do
But let the love-lights die.
“ Did I love you?” is what you ask,
Whatl all unwitting still?
My life is in your smile to bask,
Your frown my soul could kill;
To answer you’s an easy task,
I did love—and I will.
And if we never more should mset,
I’d pray for you one prayer—
That God should ever watch my sweet,
And keep her good as fair,
And to the bright land guide her feet,
And bless her, here, and there.
Should I be vexed, when I alone
Have been the cause of pain?
No men? regrets can now atone
For pleasure's selfish reign.
We both had happiness, my own,
But who has had the gain?
A memory of what has been,
A whispering through the nights,
A gentle touch no eye has seen,
a dream of dear delights—
Theso are the shadows that we glean
By fond love’s fading lights.
Ah, dearl it ever was the way.
Since mortals feeling had;
The little god of love at play
Drives men and women mad;
The greater is the j jy by day
The surer night is sad.

It is meet that a poundkeeper should be
a sleeping partner with his brother, who is a mail-
contractor. The other day we met him (the 0.k.)
running a mob of fairly fat horses. “Well,
Poundy, you’ve a good cheque in the fees for
that lot.” “By and bye, Scotty, when they’re
poor. We’ll make a bloomin’ sight more out of
them just now, by sweatin’ them in the night-
coach.’’ And yet they’ll refuse a swagman a lift.
When Scotty the Wrinkler has a cheque
of over £5O, he goes to Sydney and sometimes
hires a horse to ride or to drive. One day he hid
thirty shillings’ worth with the hounds, and being a
fair horseman, he took full value, a jackanapes
in greasy cords and odd spurs suggested that he
was taking it out of his nag. t'. and W. being a
strict Calvinist, answered and said, “Go to and
read thy Bible. The hireling fieeth because he is
an hireling.” That evening he discovered that he
of the cords and spurs was the livery-stable pro-
prietor.
With a falling market, the swindler and
the mad speculator, no longer having a margin to
mortgage, have their nefarious deeds exposed to
the eye of the world. A certain Sydney solicitor
has gone wrong aid has suddenly taken his depar-
ture. How much he has “ struck ” a trusting
public for will, perhaps, be known only when the
sea gives up its dead and this much-respected
young shark returns from the land where the
pelican builds her nest out of forged bills and the
grey hair of widows.
One of the heroes of the sumptuous cere-
mony of “ opening (the British) Parliament in
person ’ was the flunkey specially told off to look
after the Queen’s footstool, who crawled on his
hands and knees up and down the steps of the
throne. An enthusiastic eye-witness found some-
thing peculiarly impressive in the spectacle of this
flunkey “crouching low—almost to the ground.”
But to us there seems something inconsistent
about a wbrm crawling along otherwise than as
a worm. The next time he has to shift the Royal
footstool we hope he will receive the historical
command: “On thy belly shall thou go.”
THE LATE WILLIAM LANDSBOROUGH,
Explorer.
Mr. D. F. Johnston, one of the owners of
the Colanne station on the Barnett River, Queens-
land, has been down in Hobart, and, as an intelli-
gent and inquiring tourist should do, visited the
old convict settlement of Port Arthur. He jotted
down his thoughts, and sent them to his friends in
the North. “ When one sees,” he says in one
place, “ the flogging or room of torture, entered
through many doors, which were closed to drown
the fearful cries of the poor wretches while under
torture of the lash, which sometimes brought re-
lief in death under its application; the chapel in
which each prisoner stood in a box so fixed that
he saw only the preacher and the guard on either
side watching him with loaded carbine; then one
can understand what an awful doom was that of a
convict in that bygone day as compared with im-
prisonment at the present time.” No doubt this
description prayed on the minds of the people on
the Burnett, but with regard to the flogging is it
not after all as humane to kill a man off with
one good dose of the lash as to flog him to
the point of death, revive him with brandy,
doctor him up for a while, and then flog
him again, repeating the routine till the
wretch has been made viler than a skinned
brute? With regard to the prisoner being put
in a box by himself when at religious service, is
it not better than to have him have access to an
elderly lady Bible-reader in such a way as to cause
within the walls of the prison the mad violence
of disposition which jealousy, or any of the thou-
sand sentiments allied to love, creates in the daily
life of the outer world ? Marcus Clarke mentions a
Port Arthur convict who survived the spectacle
of the loaded carbine. The Sydney newspapers
told recently of a man who, instead of being con-
fronted with a loaded carbine in his devotional
humours, was confronted with a female Bible-
reader, and this man was duly hanged 1

OUR
CHILDREN'S
COLUMN
Again do our young friends the little folks, for-
sake the seductive alley-tor and fascinating cat to
enter upon literary labours. We love to receive
the blotted and scrawled screeds of our juvenile
M- m "c* >* /o '
iuniuSei. ’The advent of these missives to the
editorial tabife is as a sight of the Promised Land to
the hooknosed Hebrew of Old Testament times,
or as a glahS of striogy and a sangwidge to one of
the professional unemployed. There is an ttmos-
phere of innorcence, a savour of simplicity in these
missives which carries us back to the days when

our only capital in the world was a handful of
apple-seeds, three commoneys and a chow, and a
threepenny boxer. Now we are worth millions-
,n intellect, and are hoaourod with the confllen-
tlal missive; of juveniles who write in a fashion
which takes all saccharine sweetness from candy
assimilated by the Jernil children, and causes
the little folks of the Sydney Tribune to curl up
with Impotent envy. Here, for instance, is the
quaint recital of a youth whose verse would bring
him infinitely more credit than his spelling; this
is often the way—the brightest literary genius we
ever knew always spelt Alfred with a ph, two d’s,
and an 1, and News with two o’s and two e’s. But
we would introduce our contributor, who writes:

I ftm a most intelligent child, and leant write
letters like them. Pa says if I was like some of
the JerNil kiddies he could send some of bis darks
away and get me to keep his books. He sayß a
young man at three years of age should bo looking
about him for some profitable imployment to fol-
low. He remarked I would never be a prodigy,
my hair was too red, and he never recollected
seeing a gold-topped infant wonder. That was a
bad speech for pa to make. Ma Is slight’y inclined
to be auburn, and very much inclined to be mus-
cular; pa is slight and short, with very little hair
to speak of. Ma heard his observation and
swooped, when she swoops something has to shift,
on this occasion it was pa, he shifted right into the
yard with the toe of ma’s No. 3 waving frantically
behind him. He didn’t know she heard him, or be
wouldn’t have spoken that way. Sometimes I feel
sorry for pa, sorry that he got married you know ?
though perhaps if he had not I would not have
been here now. I mnist tell you about pa and the
cow. He bought a cow and a little calf the other
day, and a man brought them home and put them
in the yard. Next morning it was necessary to
separate the infant ox from its mother, and pa
went in the yard to perform the feat. I don’t
think he understands dairy farming to any great
extent. He is too rash with veal. He caught the
calf by the neck and tried to stick him under the
hen-coop. The cow was watching the proceedings
with a critical eye, and just as pa was pulling the
hen-coop over the little ox, she protested. It was
a stubborn protest, and I don’t think pa will sit
down on anything but a pillow for the next fort-
night. That’s where the cow hit him; he was very
much surprised at her assaulting him. He had
been reading about the gentle klne and the soft-
eyed milch cows till he believed the books were
true. He doesn’t believe that now. Says cows are-
dangerous and bloodthirsty, and he Is willin g to
swap our cow and calf away lor a good second-
hand wheelbarrow, or a yellow pup. He says city
milk is good enough for him, anyway. I will tell*

HEALTH WITHOUT MEDICINE.
Is obtained speedily and permanently by adopting
the safe and never- failing remedy of the new mode
of treatment by Electricity, as supplied to the
human system by wearing the MAGNET ICAL
ELECTKIC APPLIANCE CO.’S genuine ELEC-
TRIC BELT, a restorer of impaired vitality and
failing health. It is an unvarying success in the
cure and alleviation of Rheumatism, Indigestion,
Lumbago, Sciatica, Paralysis, Epilepsy, Constipa-
tion, Nervous Debility, and the numerous ailments
consequent upon living In a semi-tropical climate,
and the baneful effects of malaria, which alone
are caused by the deficiency or abstraction from
the body of the all-pervading element of life-
electrieity. This mode of treatment is by far the
most perfect and successful method yet discovered
(combined with perfect safety) for supplying to the
body the continuous or imperceptible current of
electricity, without the aid of chain bands or use
of acid, thus giving no inconvenience to the
wearer. They are charged ready for use, and re-
tain their full power for a considerable period.
But to avoid any disappointment by their possible
loss of electric power, and to keep the appliances
up to their original strength, we undertake to re-
charge any of our appliances at the expiration oi
twelve months, free of cost. One of the special
features of this treatment is the electric corset,
which is unsurpassed by its curative properties in
all female complaints, and is of superior shape and
manufacture. Price, 10s. and 15s.
GENT’S ELECTRIC BELTS are manufactured
expressly for tropical climates, of superior mate-
rial, in the shape of a riding belt, and are very
durable. Price, 155.; special power, 30s In order-
ing size of waist outside first garment is required.
If mailed, 3s. extra. Lung Invigorators for the
successful treatment of all lung complaints,
hitherto without the domain of Electric Agency,

should adopt this treatment before it is too late

The public are warned against worthless imi a-

the adoption of this mode of treatment has in-
duced other people to attempt, by so-called cau-
tions and notices, to mislead the public. Therefore

AYER’S
Hair Vigor
restores, with the gloss and freshness of
youth, faded or gray hair to a natural, rich
brown color’, or deep black, as may be desired.
By its use light or red hair may be darkened,
thin hair thickened, and baldness often,
though not always, cured.
It checks falling of the hair, and stimu-
lates a weak and sickly growth to vigor. It
prevents and cures scurf and dandruff, and
heals nearly every disease peculiar to the
scalp. As a Ladies’ Hair Dressing, the
Vigor is unequalled ; it contains neither oil
nor dye, renders the hair soft, glossy, and
silken in appearance, and imparts a delicate,
agreeable, and lasting perfume.
Mr. 0. P. Bbicher writes from Kirby, 0.,
July 3, 1882 : “ Last fall my hair commenced
falling out, and in a short time x became
nearly bald. I used part of a bottle of
Ayer’s Hair Vigor, which stopped the fall-
ing of the hair, and started a new growth. I
have now a full head of hair growing vigor-
ously, and am convinced that but for the
use of your preparation I should have been
entirely bald.”
J. W. Bowen, proprietor of the McArthur
(Ohio) Enquirer, says : “Ayer’S Hair Vigor
is a most excellent preparation for the hair.
I speak of it from my own experience. Its
use promotes the growth of new hair, and
makes it glossy and soft. The Vigor is also
a sure cure for dandruff. Not within _my
knowledge has the preparation ever failed
to give entire satisfaction.”
Mr. Angus Fairbairn, leader of the
celebrated “ Fairbairn Family” of Scottish
Vocalists, writes from Boston, Mass., Feb. 6,
1880 : “Ever since my hair began to give sil-
very evidence of the change which fleeting
time procureth, I have used Ayer’s Hair
Vigor, and so have been able to maintain
an appearance of youthfulness a matter of
considerable consequence to ministers, ora-
tors, actors, and in fact every one who lives
in the eyes of the public.”
Mrs. O. A. Prescott, writing from 18 Elm
St., Charlestown, Mass., April 14, 1882, says :
“ Two years ago about two-thirds of my hair
came off. It thinned very rapidly, and I was
fast growing bald. On using Ayer’s Hair
Vigor the falling stopped and a new growth
commenced, and in about a month my head
was completely covered with short hair. It
has continued to grow, and is now as good as
before it fell. I regularly used but one bottle
of the Vigor, but now use it occasionally as
a dressing.”
We have hundreds of similar testimonials
to the efficacy of Ayer’s Hair Vigor. It
needs but a trial to convince the most skepti-
cal of its value.

turden to themselves, through early indiscretion
or over-indulgence. It is to those that this adver-
tisement is addressed. Impotence drags its victim
in its unhappy train through years of suffering,
rendering bia existence a misery. He sees his
fellow beings hate, hearty, and vigorous—in the
full enjoyment of manhood’s greatest privilege -

tariness, and shunning society generally.

A DAY WITH THE DRAPERS.
It was not to be, for one moment, sup-
posed that we, as abstract and “ brief ” chroniclers
of the times, would let an opportunity escape us
of beholding-, commingled upon the verdant
sward in healthful recreation, all the talent of the
tailors—all the dons of the drapery. We know our
duty to our constituents and to Society we trust,
too well to iet pass such an event as the Sydney
drapers’ picnic with no record of its varied en-
chantments—no picture of its dazzling delights.
But we don’t mind telling you that even had not a
stern sense of duty called us, we should still have
been there; had we not been impelled thither by
the action of circumstances, we should yet have
been on the spot, for that gathering possessed for
us, independent altogether of the festivities sur-
rounding it,-a weird and powerful fascination.
* * *
It is possible for one to dwell for an
unconscionably long time in this city without
even seeing a draper s assistant either habited in
his coat or adorned with his hat; and similarly,
perhaps, not even the “oldest inhabitant’’ of
these regions will have beheld, in all the varied
phases of his existence, a shop-walker without his
long frock-coat, his classical “ wave,” and his
superior smile. There was a time when we be-
lieved that a shop-walker would never unbend—
that in his most social and domestic moments he
was never out of an “ attitude.” By and by, how-
ever, there came to live in our street a very tall
man, with a very short wife, and three melodious
children. A whisper went up and down the street
that the tall stranger was shop-walker at Bobbins,
upon which the residents of our street (a slavish
lot) nearly smothered the adult strangers with at-
tentions, and the children with treacle. The
juvenile portion of the residents were not behind-
hand either in the payment of their attentions,
and would, as occasion required, “ sing out ” to
the mother upstairs (being deceived by her sta-
ture), “ Hi, Melial Tell your mother to come
down. The Chinaman wants his elghteenpenoe.”
Well, it transpired that when at home this shop-
walker of Mr. Bobbins’ did unbend. One night
we were invited to surreptitiously peep through
the front-room window and behold him in the
act. We peeped. The fond father was there right
enough, clad in a dog’s-wool-and-oakum jacket,
plush slippers, and a carpet smoking-cap, playing
“ honey pots ” with the children, while mother,
outside, was dishing up the beef-and-liver tangle.
To be a honey-pot you have to clasp your hands
over your shins and collide with honey-pots simi-
larly situated. If you capsize a honey-pot that
counts one to you, and—well, we can’t remember
the exact technique of the game, but we have
a distinct recollection of seeing the shop-
walker to Bobbins a honey-pot in the full
degradation of the character, butted about by his
children, and the feeblest of the feeble on bis
“pins;” yet, in spite of all the ridiculousness of
the situation, he was, when the family allowed
him to attain a perpendicular position—a honey-
pot with an attitude 1
♦ ♦ *
It will now be patent to you all that from
the moment we saw the picnic announced in the
amusement columns of the papers that we re-
solved to be present. Besides the list of enthrall-
ing entertainments advertised with the lavishness
that betokens the great mind of the draper-be-
sides the catalogue of sports set forth in that splen-
dour of style which only the soft-goods prince can
be said to have successfully mastered-there was

to be revealed that spectacle to rare to mortal eye
—a completely attired draper. It would cost
money to be present-that we knew—but we must
be there! This was an occasion on which to
scatter gold, for it is necess try for the historian
to attend such a gathering as this with his vizor
down. Otherwls > the draper (who becomes a little
wearing on certain subjects) will say to you, with
a friendly jerk of the elbow, nine times in nine
minutes, “ I say, mister, mind you give us a good
report.” Ah I what a thump our beart gave us as
we caught sight of the distant steamer, gay with
the bunting of ages, that was to convey us to the
trysting-place of the fabrlc-flutterer Clontarf.
A thrill went through us as we approached nearer.
We were on the point, we felt, of meeting some
old friends. Something told us that, somewhere
amongst the smoke-wreaths, we should encounter
the draper seductive, the draper delusive, the
draper digagi, and the draper morose. We think
of them all, it is the draper digagi we knew the
best. He had, so far as we remember, a stall all to
himself, at which he sold jewellery, gloves, scent,
and other articles of an enchanting though costly
nature, in which the attractions of the vendor
caused us to Invest to an extent that we feel now
was beyond our means. He was a short, thickset
young fellow with a luxuriant crop of hair, which
he evidently twisted without remorse into paper
every night, and elaborately soothed with the
grease of the bear (native or arctic) every morn-
ing. His whiskers, which were ample, were, if
possible, more curled than his hair, while he had
his moustache and imperial fiercely spiked a la
militaire. He wore his shirt-collar low, and
affected the Walter Montgomery tie. His manner
was perfect! This draper digagi had one set
phrase which was our destruction whenever we
beard it; yet many is the
time when we have de-
tected ourselves drawing
him out, knowing all
the while that three min-
utes of his society would
entail the purchase of a
cake of soap and a brazen
collar-stud. He would
flutter afan, for lrstance,
with the air of a Tycoon,

The steamer was at
Princes Stairs—a place to
us of gloomy rtm nia-
cences. Many is the time
we have left them brave
in buojancy and strong
in ipirit, only to be de-
posited there again, in
the gloaming, a sour and
revengeful mortal. Pic-
nic port has sometimes
occasioned this strange
metamorphosis—and not
unfrequently a special
brand of champagne
“that will be the very
thing for the reporters; ”
but generally the oratory
has been the cause of our
discomfiture. On this oc-
casion, however, we bad
no uneasiness as to the
result. All was bathed
in sunshine, and, as we
neared the boat and be-
came conscious half the
Burwood baud.wbich was
blasting out a selection
known only to them-
selves, was on the Quay,
we lelt that this was a
gala day indued 1 To pur-
chase a ticket of a young
man draped io blue, and
to board our steamer, was
the work of a m< ment.
The boat was crowded, so
we sought out a seat—
the only one vacant—on
the upper deck near the
funnel, and with the sun
at 130, and the funnel at
1840 , enjoyed a few com-
fortable moments prior
to the start. A little more
delay and we should
have shed tears through
our boots. Once started,
however, ana the breeze
began to operate, we dis-
covered ours was the
most joyous spot in the
ship. This becoming pat-
ent to two young women
m dark-blue gowns and
vermilion trillings, they
edged up a bit off Chr s
Point, or Bradley’s Head,
or the Bottle and Glass,
or somewhere, and one
of them, alter much
picturesque lingering of
a block-ua bracelet, ad-
dressing herself to us,
said, with a giggle, “Are
you a draper, sir ?” “ No,
ma’am,” we replied,
gravely; ‘our trade.knowa
more of horses than hosi-
ery-we are undertakers.”
Ob this she clapped her bands, and gave a merry
laugh. “Just what my sister, Milly, said. When
she saw you, sir, she knew it immediate.” What
could we do but bow our acknowledgments to the
other lady, and look with somewhat of depression
upon the prospect ?
> • •
Talking of “depression” reminds us that
lying parallel with us at Princes Stairs was one of
our tamiilar floating palaces, containing a party of
lour gentlemtn in black, a boy in soiled canvas,
and a dog This craft—whose appearance at once
denoted uproarious festivity—was labelled, “Book-
sellers’ and Stationers’ Picnic,” and the dilatori-
ness of the B’s and S.’s in coming “ forred ” had
had such an effect upon a little committeeman,
that he appeared covered with indignation as with
an übter. Nor did a request for “ an Echo, please,
sir,” from a jocular member of our company tend
in any way to mend matters. We never, indeed,
saw an order for that innocent little journal pro-
duce so much Irascibility before ; though we
must confess we have seen people similarly
affected after reading itl
• •
We are there, and stand upon Clontarf’s
burning sand while the strains are wafted towards
us (a boon the breeze affords us) of the rest of the
Burwood band. Turn, turn. They file in by their
hundreds, a remarkably smart lot, but our heart
sank within us as we asked ourselves the question,
“ Are we drapers ?” If not, we were in any case
undone. How could we again face the office after
scattering its wealth in an idle jaunt ? And, worse
than all, of what had been the value of our study
of the genus ?—what return had we received for
QUr outlay in ’bus tickets—for the amount of law-
ful currency we had expended upon goods of a
“ fancy ” description ? On the other hand, could a
coat and hat so effectually disguise a race that we
—lmpossible! At the tail of the new arrivals
filtered in a committee-man. He wore a smiling
face and his badge of office, and his moustache
announced (somewhat indiscreetly, as it seemed
to us) that he had but shortly before partaken of a
glass of porter. To him we bluntly; but civilly,
put the question, “ Do they, or do they not belong
to the trade ?” He caught us by the lappel and
swung us Into the shade of a spreading flagstaff
before replying. “ Not 30 per cent,” he said
hoarsely; ‘and I’ve worked for this!” When he
had uttered these words, the gentleman walked
away with his head bowed, in a dejected manner,
and would (from his aspect) have probably walked
into the ocean had he not received a timely hail
from a numerous party whose appearance pointed
suspiciously to the fact of their possessing some-
thing in a bottle. Nothing else, we believe—such
was the perturbation of his feelings—would have
stopped him at this juncture. We gazed around;
the scene disclosed was pregnant with life in many
of its most glorious phases. Taere was foot racing,
and cricket, and dancing in the pavilion ( ‘no two
gentlemen allowed to dance together”), and, to
crown everything, that delightful and intellectual
pastime, “ putting the 14B). weight.” This portion
of the sports occurred after luncheon, and was a
tremendous spectacle. We only waited, however,
to see one competitor give evidence of his skill.
This must have been considerable; for, though he
only “ put ” the Iron about 4ft.. he was successful
ia scattering to the winds about 800 spectators.

Our admiration for the primitive pastime
of foot-racing being well known. It will not sur-
prise the reader to learn that we laid ourselves out
to see the 150 yards handicap. This started about
13.30, and in viewing the athletes before the strug-
gle, we could not help remarking that the rule
laid down by the committee as to the attire of the
competitors ordained rather that it should be
“ chaste” than “appropriate.” Most of them, In-
deed, were “professional” so far as their socks
and drawers reached, but decidedly motly as to
the remainder. But let us be just: there was one
exception. This was a gentleman, so pe feet
bis professional attire, that it seemed, as you
looked at him, that the whole world would be un-
able to afford pedestrianism of a class proportion-
ate to the completeness of his equipment. He was
lightly handicapped, and we at onoe singled him
out an easy winner. In the result, however, it was
proven that however much clothes may “make
the man,” picturesque tights by no means make
the runner; for our hero finished such a disreput-
able last that the winners were halt through their
return drink, a quarter of a mile off, before he
had limped forlornly over the prostrate tape. [We
may remark, here, that our thanks are due to the
see. of sports, Mr. Sandon, for the evident pates he
had taken in making the handicap, &c„ a success.]

But if there was humour in the athletic
sports, how many hearty laughs were to be ex-
tracted from the.cricket match. Theknotching-
board ” was set up under a tree, which, while it
exhibited more shade than a three-pronged fork,
would have been badly beaten In that respect by a
bat-rack. The competitors were selected from ’he
houses of Messrs. Thompson and Messrs. Cater,
and they (with the secretaries) are certainly enti-
tled to the thanks of the community for their un-
tiring exertions in making a success of the match I
We visited this contest on several occasions,
and each time had to retire in a precipitate
and unseemly manner, in order not to attract
towards ourselves the attention (and subsequent
vengeance) of the cricketers. On one occasion,
though, we were very nearly being detected. A
youthful batsman having made a two, had com-
fortably reached his ground, when the bowler at
the other end scattered his wicket with a throw of
unerring aim. “How’s.that, umpire?” was the
cry. “Out,” cried the marksman, triumphantly.
“ I say * not out,’” said the umpire, a youth in a
pair of black pants and a “ pot ” hat, mildly. “He
saysi ‘ not out,’ ” said the batsman, still lingering at
the Gates of Paradise. “But I say you are out,
and out you go 1 ” cried the bowler, fiercely. And
out he did go. and had hardly! time to agree with
the rest of his side that, in these cases, the um-
pire’s decision should be final, when his successor
was bowled with a “Yorker” that would have
demoralized Barlow. The defeated one reached
the shade of the spreading chestnut, gloomy, but
composed; and he, too, was heard to instantly
agree that in eases of this kind the umpire’s deci
sion must certainly be regarded as final The
• wicket” which was innocent of matting was
about as level as the bed of a dry creek, after a
fight between two alligators. The bowling, in
consequence, was of a most deadly description,
the bail in the hands of the trundlers partaking at
times oonsiderably.of the character of a firework
One ball we SAW strike the ground about mid-
wloket, soar high over the batsman’s head, and
take his near side bail, just as he was spitting on
his hands to get ready for another swipe.

In intervals of looking on at this enter-
taining contest, we contemplated the dancirg in
the new pavilion, and also the feats of a feeble
little boy who did “ Blondln ” on a cable elevated
about 4ft. high, and balanced himself with tde
aid of a pole which appeared like unto Goliah s
spear, “ tnick as a weaver’s beam.” He went for-
wards and backwards, then backwards and for-
wards. while his family watched for his safety
with open arms below. This terrific performance
over, and the Intrepid rope-walker having been
restored whole in mind and body to his friends,
we shook his father’s coat-cuff and entreated dim
to cherish that youth, “ When yen perform
before Lord Carington and the other crowned
heads,” we suggested, “ perhais the rope might
be a trifle—eh ? ” “ Sir,” interrupted the father
of the phenomenon, “1 am pledged to that. At
the dizzy elevation of 13ft will my child exe-
cute Biondin’s most difficult feats, fils the risk
mine the responsibility.” “ Prosper Lion-bean I”
we murmured, and walked pondering.to wards the
pavilion.

We were passing airily in the wicket-gate
which leads to the main-door of the new pavilion,
when we were accosted by a not uncivil personage
upon whose brow the perspiration hung io ropes,
and who demanded our tiohet. Equal to the oc-
casion, we immediately produced tde counterfoil
of the pasteboard purchased by us of the draper

many words, that for tripping in the mazy, on tha
occasion, an extra tiohet costing a shilling was
necessary. He then pointed to a primitive pay.
hole on his right where differences of would-be
votaries of Terpsichore, and the committee were
settled with the aid of either steel or silver. The
call of duty alone was our excuse for electing to
deal with the latter m*-tal, for certainly there was
nothing in the drap-ra “ ads ” to lead one to be-
lieve that extra money would be charged for
dancing. This sharp practice on the part of the
committee was evidently the cause of much dis-
satisfaction amongst the guests, for, on our return
to the wickc t-gate, we discovered it to be be-
sieged by a considerable crowd -the male portion
of which whs decidedly averse to “ parting” the
extra Robert. We have a shrewd Idea—to adopt
a popular term—that it was only at the last
moment the committee resolved to make this ob-
noxious extra charge, because, in the tickets
Issued, there la no mention whatever of the
pavilion, and the counterfoil which we have
before us read as follows:—" Drapers’ annual
picnic, February 36. Return ticket. Admission
to the ground.” This is printed in red ink, while
the other ticket, which you purchased prior to
hoarding the steamer, and which purports to pass
you from hall to hall of dazzling light, is printed
in blue. We have mentioned this, because a con-
tract is a contract, if only a .two-bob one; but we
do not wish to detract from the zeal of the presi-
dent and secretaries, whose efforts to make the
affair a success were Indeed as vigorous as they
were untiring. .

Onoe inside the pavilion, and you forgot
having been beguiled of your silver. Yqu reoog-
nised, if your mind was at
all liberally constituted,
that the spectacle un-
folded was worth more
than the price of adnrs-
sion. it was difficult at
once, on entering, to ob-
tain a view of anything
except the band, in conse-
quence of the crowded
state of the place; but
with a little persever-
ance, it was possible to
effect a tour of the room,
where varied entertain-
ment encountered you at
every step. As we en-
tered, about 2000 young
men and young women
were dancing the alberta
to the severe strains of
(by this time) the com-
bined Bur wood Bsnd.
These musicians,familiar
after long with the
tune, permitted them-
selves to be fantastic la
their execution of it, a d,
consequently, the pavi-
lion rang with melody of
a nature which was un-
known to the Halls of
Taia even -efore their
much-vauated harp was
hung up mute upon a
nail. The band were
certainly putto very lute
trouhre from an artistic
point of view, since all
they did was to hammer
away at a figure of the
aiberts until shuffling of
feet warned them to de-
sist, and then change the
tune with an airy bold-
ness, as if the idea had
originated wholly and
soleiy with themselves.
The company was pretty
evenly Balanced as to
sexes, and the girls were
as remarhaole for pretti-
ness as they were for
absence of style. Their
diesses were for the mesc
part of poor materlsi anf
the ornamentation gar-
ish, but all were neat
about the shoes and
stockings, and the extent
of their silk gloves re-
vealed the fact that
though perhaps these
young ladles could not
j.ubtiy aspire to be aris-
tocratic, tney could at
least lay claim to be
genteel. The young men
afforded us muon en-
tertainment. Tneir smiles
and bows when they
“set to partners” cm led
us up at every footstep.

man. Shortly betore leav-
ing the pavilion, an ex-
ceedingly smart young
man asked us to oblige
him with the time. We,
glad of an opportunity
of flashing our Water-
bury in such a numerous
company, obliged him re-
adily enough, and, having
done so, enquired what
• house ” he belonged to.
“ Ruffling and Trous-
seau, ' he replied. We
trusted that the value
of his appointment was
in keeping with his dis-
ting aimed appearance.
“ On, yes,” he said, with
a laugh, “I can’t com-
plain; my billet about
tops the lot.” “Indo dV‘
we said, in a congratula-
tory tone, “Oh, yes,”
ha rejoined proudly, “I'm

1 We should like to
tell you more about the
picnic, but time presses, and even as we are
writing this a howl has gone up for “copy,”
which cannot he, with prudence, disregarded. It
would have amused you to have heard, too, how
we wont into the temperance bar annexe, and
boldly tackled the half-crown lunch “arranged
for ” by the committee, and how we beat a hasty
retreat before three mutton cubes and a floating
island of cabbage. Many of you would have liked
to have hoard how we subsequently lunched with
the members of the committee—John Davies and
Ab g iil—in a little room leading off the kitchen of
the note!, and loaded up with cold tongue and
mashed potatoes, the latter being continually ex-
tracted hot and hot from the stove, and served by
the waiter with much heartiness and dexterity.
No; there is really no room for any more. In-
deed, it is only by squeezing that we are enabled
to conclude this article by—we quote from the
daily paper—“ thanking the president and secre-
taries for their exertions in rendering the affair
the bright and merry success it undoubtedly was.’
