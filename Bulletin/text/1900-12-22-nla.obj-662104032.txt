THE RED PAGE.
I RUBBED my eyes and sat up, with a
vivid impression that another person
was in the room with me. The nervous
reaction had quickened the beating of
my heart, and as the blood surged through
my torpid brain the last remnants of my
dream fled over the horizon of conscious-
ness. I seemed to have been asleep for
hours, and ...
There was another person in the room. He
sat in the chair opposite, regarding me
mildly, a little quizzically. I knew he was
not real; yet I was wide awake, —and there
he sat.
He leaned forward a little uneasily (the
chair was not comfortable), his left hand on
his knee, the right holding a gold pince-nez
level with his breast. A gentleman of middle-
age, stout, rather short, plainly dressed in
well-fitting black clothes. I marked the
dainty buckled slippers, and the lace ruffles
at his wrists. The hands were white and
soft; a ring with a green stone was on the
middle finger of the left hand.
His face curiously mingled grossness and
refinement. The large eyes were mild and
Laded ; the nose was delicately shaped, with
small nostrils ; but the - mouth was large and
loose, and his skin looked flabby, his flesh
sodden. The face was clean-shaven, and in
his bent attitude the chin fell in creases on
his low collar. 1 noted the broad white fore-
head ; the grizzled hair, worn a little long ;
the fine width and elevation of the head. He
sat with a half-smile, as if interested in and
permitting the scrutiny. And I was wide
awake.
It was decidedly interesting. I long
ago convinced myself that the ghost, as
commonly understood, is an intellectual im-
possibility. Yet here I sat face to face with
an indubitable ghost : he simply could not
be real. Now I that looked at him he was not
real : his outlines were just a little shadowy,
his form just a little vague. But there was
no doubt that I was awake : I moved my left
arm to reassure myself, and became keenly
alive to the advantages of the situation. This
was an experience to be watched and
treasured. And all the while he scanned me
with his meditative smile. I spoke, measur-
ing my words and observing their effect.
“I am pleased to see you ; but you will
pardon me if I do not understand. Yet
there must be purely physical reasons for
your presence.”
The apparition’s smile broadened a little.
“ Precisely,” he said. “Permit me to ex-
plain myself.” His voice was quite distiuct,
but a little faint, as if coming from a dis-
tance. The intonation was decidedly that of
a man of culture, a man of good society.
And I was wide awake, intently registering
all my impressions upon memory.
“I am Oscar \Yilde,” he said. And with
the air of one awaiting astonishment he
raised his right arm to the back of the chair,
and rested his head upon his right hand.
I was not astonished ; I was too much
interested ; and my reasoned disbelief in
ghosts is too strong to be shaken.
“I am Oscar Wilde,” he said, “ and at
the same time I am an emanation from your-
self. Did you guess that ? ”
Yes,” I said.; “ but Ido not thoroughly
comprehend.”
“ I will explain further. I am a phenome-
non of dual consciousness, not without pre-
cedent, but at present unusual. You are
hware that your brain, like several other
organs of your body, is doubled, —or if you
choose, halved, —and that the halves are
in themselves independent, though bridged
by nerves presided over by the controlling
or co-ordinating centres where your con-
sciousness of individuality and personality
resides. Usually the halves work in har-
mony under this control. But before I
could have the pleasure of meeting you, you
must have, as it were, dislocated your
brain.”
“ You mean to say that I am talking to
you with one half of my brain, consciously
controlled, while you sit there and talk to
me with the other half of my brain, which
has somehow escaped from my conscious
control ? ” -
“Exactly. You are doing now in excep-
tional fashion what some other animals do
continually. In the shark, for example, the
nerves of the body on each side do not con-
verge on the spinal cord, but have direct
and separate communication with the brain
through a cranial nerve. Thus the shark
can rest with one side of its body at a time,
—sleep with one eye open,—and follow a
vessel continuously.”
“But that does not account for your ap-
pearance in visible shape as Oscar Wilde,
and your capacity to speak intelligently. ”
“Pardon me, the explanation is quite
sufficient. Since my death you have been
thinking of me a great deal ; you have
called up all you have read or heard regard-
ing me ; you have spent the last two days in
reading over all my books, —they lie on the
table now, —your brain was entirely concen-
trated upon me when you fell asleep.”
“Well ?”
“ I am simply a result of reflex action,
m the ordinary course, when you see an ob-
ject, it is printed by light On the retina of
your eye, and the image is pictured on the
sight-centres of your brain in order that you
may consciously see. Doubtless you have
often shut your eyes and recalled a vivid
image in the” shape and colour of life. In
my case, you have retained such a vivid im-
pression of me in your brain that the picture
has been carried thence along the optic nerVe
and printed on your retina. So you see me as
an actual shape outside you.”
“Then you have no corporeal substance,”
I said ; “ you are simply a visual illusion ? ”
“ That is so.”
“But how can you speak to me intelli-
gently ! ”
“ Close your eyes ! ”
I complied.
“ Can you still hear me speaking ? ”
“.Yes ; as before.”
“ Well, it is the uncontrolled half of your
brain which is speaking, and transferring
impressions of sound and sense tp the half
which you still consciously control.”
“ This is very interesting ; and no doubt
it accounts for the whole series of ghostly
phenomena. The visions of a deity, the
mysterious words, the stigmata reproduced
on devotees—-these all arise from a similar
cause ? ”
“ Yes ; they are merely the results of a
brain giving physical impressions instead of
receiving them,—working backwards, as it ,
were. But it is rare to find a brain so well
disconnected as yours is at present.”
“ Then you are really only my impression
of Oscar Wilde—the Oscar Wilde whom I
have constructed in my brain by dint of im-
pressions registered and concentrated, and
when you speak it is I talking to Myself.”
“ That is so ; but you see me better and
more fully than if your brain were com-
pletely under your control. lam unmixed
with baser matter.”
It was most interesting; and I was
wide awake. Only some loss of memory,: —
some difficulty in speech,—some inability to
think as vigorously as usual, —indicated that
I was doing without half my brain . . .
“Ah!”
“What is it?” enquired the apparition
blandly.
“My right side is paralysed; I cannot
move my right arm.”
“ I am afraid that I have robbed you of
the power.”
“And how long will this last?”
“ You know as well as I, since you are I.”
“ And you are Oscar Wilde ? ”
“To all your intents and purposes I am
Oscar Wilde. You are aware that every-
thing, every person, has no existence for
you except as an impression upon your con-
sciousness.”
“ But you talk to me in my own words ;
it is really I who am talking. ”
“You—transfused through your impres-
sion of the personality of Oscar Wilde. And
if I were veritably Oscar Wilde risen from
the dead I could only give you your own
impression. It might differ a little ; but
seeing that you have so far merged yourself
in me that I can appear to you as an
external shape, with a separate individu-
ality, I hardly think the impression would
be as true or as vivid.”
I reflected : the opportunity was not one
to let slip. I was face to face with Oscar
Wilde as I never could have been had I
retained full control, of my brain ; and he
was capable of originating individual
thoughts, based indeed on my conception of
him, but untinctured by my conscious self. . .
“ Your life has been extinguished in igno-
miny,” I said. “ Are you satisfied ? ”
“I am and I am not. If I were to live
again, without foreknowledge of the future,
doubtless I would repeat my course of
thought and action to the last tittle! Could
I ten years ago have foreseen this end,
possibly I would have endeavoured to avoid it.
But since I knew nothing of the future, I
was ruled by the past and the present like
other men. That is a way of saying, that
your question is (pardon me) foolish. Prob-
ably I could have better adjusted myself to
circumstances. But my general line was
fixed. I would always have been a disciple
of aesthetics rather than of ethics ; for the
reason that, as I have pointed out, ethics
merely make existence possible, while aesthe-
tics make life lovely and wonderful, fill it
with new forms, and give it progress,
variety and change. And when we reach
that true culture that is our aim, we
attain to that perfection of which the saints
have dreamed, the perfection of those to
whom sin is impossible, not because they
make the renunciations of the ascetic, but
because they can do everything they wish
without hurt to the soul, and can wish for
nothing that can do the soul harm, the soul
being an entity so divine that it is able to
transform into elements of a richer experi-
ence, or a finer susceptibility, or a newer
mode of thought, acts or passions that, with
the common, would be commonplace, or
with the uneducated ignoble,, or with the
shameful vile.” .
“ Are you not forgetting the body ? ”
“Yes; that was my mistake; I forgot
the body. I forgot that the Grecian wor-
ship of beauty is only possible in its en-
tirety to men gifted as the Greeks were
gifted and conditioned as the Greeks, were
conditioned. I forgot that the successful
development of a theory of life is always pro-
portioned to the means of the individual who
aims to develop it ; I forgot that the body
which I inherited had stored capacities and
incapacities independent of my control; and
in yielding to the pleasure of the Beautiful
I omitted to assure myself that my will was
so strong that I could have refrained
had I chosen. To do everything one
wishes without hurt to the soul, it is firs*
necessary to be so strong that one can re-
frain from the deed. I permitted my acts
to become my masters, and in their train was
drawn to an excess which no one can regret
more than I. One should isolate one’s sins,
and approach each with intelligent will in
order to relinquish it without stain or self-
reproach. In “ The Picture of Dorian
Gray ” I showed how Dorian’s portrait bore
the burden of his excesses. My fault lay
in acting continually as if I had not to bear
the burden of my own. Self-indulgence was to
me so natural that I allowed it to become
necessary. Yet my sins have given me
sweet emotions which I would never exchange
for the bitter regrets of cold virtue which
has missed its chance. It is so splendid to
die in the contemplation of one’s scarlet
sins; Were Ito live again I would sin much
more, and more wisely. It has been sad to
me to reflect that thp experience of sin
which I possessed should be lost to the
world ; that the wisdom which I distilled
from so many strange, poisoned dowers
should leave so slight a legacy of its dark
fragrance.”
“I perceive you still preserve your pose.”
“My pose is me. It is one aspect of the
Truth which I see in many other aspects.
With much that I have said to you I dis-
agree entirely. But I have represented an
artistic standpoint, and in aesthetics attitude
is everything. My pose is a mask of the
Truth, but every statement? of the truth is a
mask of the Truth. The only way to really
represent the Truth is to tell a charming lie
about, it. Truth in itself is far too ugly a
thing to carry conviction. That is the con-
stant lesson of Art, which is merely the most
interesting form of falsehood. The deplor-
able thing is that there are still so many
realistic artists engaged in represent-
ing undeniable facts. A short primer,
‘ When to Lie and How,’ if brought out in
an attractive and not too expensive form,
would no doubt command a large sale, and
would prove of real practical service to many
earnest and deep-thinking people. Such a
primer would point out that the only form
of lying that is absolutely beyond reproach
is Lying for its own sake, and the highest
development of this is Lying in Art.”
Wilde paused, and I hunted for the appro-
priate remark and did nof find it. I was
feeling dull and half-alive : but the Shape in
the chair, fed from my store of nervous
energy, had taken on vitality. His eyes
were lit ; his voice grew resonant ; evi-
dently he was interested in displaying him-
self.
“ But the art of lying,” he resumed, “ is
to lie unconsciously. That is where women-
fail ! they are excellent liars, but they lie
with understanding. They have the air of
walking round their lies admiringly, and
basking in their reflected lustre. When a
woman has lied really well, she always re-
tires into herself for a moment to be alone
with her pride—like little Jack Horner in
his corner pulling out a plum to say ‘ What
a good boy am I V Every real artist lies
unconsciously. He walks in a moonlit land
of falsehood, where the lies hang in-
crimson clusters from the dark-green
vines that have grown from a time be-
fore the foundation of the world ; and when
he picks the fruit for you to eat, he is
thrilled with the ecstasy of delight that is
the privilege of genius incapable of compre-
hending anything but tlie lie of Art. But
no woman is a genius ; women are a deco-
rative sex. They never have anything to
say, but they say it charmingly. They repre-
sent the triumph of matter over mind, just
as we men represent the triumph of mind
over morals. - The artist must live in his
Art; but women live in themselves and
their emotions. They have made an art of
love ; but when they take lovers it is merely to
havesomeone with whom they can havescenes.
And when they are too old to take lovers,
they live on the memory of the scenes.
That awful memory of women ! What a
fearful thing it is ! And what an utter
intellectual stagnation it reveals! One
should absorb the colour of life, but one
should never remember its details. Details
are always vulgar. Of course, now and then
things linger. I once wore nothing but
violets all through one season, as mourning
for a romance that would not die. Ultim-
ately, however, it did die. I forget what
killed it. I think it was her proposing to
sacrifice the whole world for me. That is
always a dreadful moment. It fills one with
the terror of eternity.” f
I nodded drowsily.
“ I trust' you enjoy my wit : it is one of
the most beautiful things in the world. I
like its pale-green phosphorescence : it
affects me as the moon must affect a mer-
maid. Since I was in prison moral people
have been scandalised by my genius : they
have said that my love of art and nature
was a mere pretence and presumption, and
some have even denied my literary power.
This seems to me a shallow, or
at least mistaken view. The fact
of a man being a murderer, for
example, is nothing against his prose.
The domestic virtues are not the true basis
of art, though they may serve as an excellent
advertisement for second-rate artists. No-
body with the true historical sense ever
dreams of blaming Nero, or scolding Tibe-
rius or censuring Crnsar Borgia. There is
no essential incongruity between crime and
culture, and we cannot re - write the
whole of history for the purpose of
gratifying our moral sense of what it
should be. Art finds her own perfection
within, and not outside of, herself. She is
not to be judged by any external standard of
resemblance. She is a veil rather than a
mirror. She has flowers that no forests
know of, birds that no woodland possesses.
She makes and unmakes many worlds,
and can draw the moon from heaven with
a scarlet thread. Hers ai’e the ‘ forms
more real than living man,’ and hers the
great archetypes of which things that have
existence are but unfinished copies. Nature
has, in her eyes, no laws, no uniformity.
She can work miracles at her will, and when
she calls monsters from the deep they come.
She can bid the almond tree blossom in win-
ter, and send the snow upon the ripe corn-
field. At her word the frost lays its silver
finger on the burning mouth of June, and
the winged lions creep out from the hollows
of the Lydian hills. The dryads peer from
the thicket as she passes by, and the brown
fauns smile strangely at her when she comes
near them. She has hawk-faced gods that
worship her, and the centaurs gallop at her
side.”
He paused reproachfully. “My dear sir,
you are not paying attention ! ”
I was not; I was falling asleep. But
Oscar Wilde now sat almost upright ; his
eyes shone ; his mouth was film and fine—
the gross flesh had fallen away from it, and
the lips were red and charming. His figure,
too, had taken rotundity ; he looked twenty
years younger.
“ My dear sir,” he repeated, and menaced
me with a merry finger, “I have been
saying things most interesting to myself—
and you were not paying attention.”
“ But you have robbed me of energy,” I
protested; “I feel quite old—you have
even taken away my youth ! ”
“Ah, Youth ! To get back my youth I
would do anything in the world, except take
exercise, get up early, or be respectable.
Youth ! there is nothing like it. The com-
mon hill-flowers wither, but they blossom
again. The laburnum will be as golden
next summer as it is now. Soon there will
be purple stars on the clematis, and year
after year the green night of its leaves will
have its purple stars. But we never get
back our youth. The pulse of joy that beats
in us at twenty, becomes sluggish. Our
limbs fail, our senses rot. We degenerate
into hideous puppets, haunted by the
memory of the passions of which we were
too much afraid, and the exquisite tempta-
tions that we did not dare to yield to . . .”
That is all I can definitely remember. I
recall a voice murmuring, murmuring me
into oblivion.
I woke as the first gleam of dawn was
coming through the window-pane. I felt
cramped, and stiff, and very tired; but I
could move freely.
And Oscar W ilde was gone.

clothes are essential to that end. C. G.
Hatte, of Newtown (Sydney), invites at-
tention to his To-Order Taiioring Depart-
ment, which has obtained a reputation
the envy of competitors. He can supply
you with a nice soft Serge Suit, indigo
dye, for 555.; a first-class suit in Serge,
Sergerette, or Tweed for 635. ; or a suit
of Apperley and Curtiss’ renowned West
of England Serge for 755. His Two
Guinea Suits (with extra pair of trousers)
of Serges, Sergerettes, and Tweeds are
still the marvel of modern tailoring.
Hatte’s has the largest selection of the

Queen Victoria lately bestowed 40s. on a
Mrs. Bennett, of Fish Alley, Tewkesbury, in con-
sideration of her having four sons shooting at the
Boers in South Africa. Surely, if Mother
Bennett was deserving of a bonus on her ex-
ported produce it ought to have been something
better than ten “ bob ” per offspring.
An American lawyer named Daniels
claims to be the only heir to the vast estates of
Sir Francis Drake, said to have been in Chancery
since the death of the great navigator. Mr.
Gant, of Camberwell (Vic.), a settler of nearly
50 years’ standing, is also in the list of claimants
as one of Drake’s descendants. But, after all,
did Drake leave any estates?
The Bulletin’s London correspondent :
I have just met a—hie—’toscated N.S.W. trooper.
He reeled up to me with a reckless disregard of his
spurs and my shins, prodded me firmly on the breast of
a venison fillet I had had for lunch, and gurgled, “I’ve
shust done--done the Agsh’nt-Gener’l for eight quid—
‘cumanaverdrink.’” Yes, I don’t think. I left him
calling at each side of Maiden Lane in search of the pave-
ment. Now he was in full uniform, and he was as full as
his uniform, naturally, and it was an A 1 first-class advt.
for his country. By all and any means, let him and his
mates get as blind as cricket bats daily, but make 'em
drink outside their uniforms.
A Victorian plain-clothes constable—a sort
of detective on trial-—coolly admitted in open
court the other day that he had accepted the assist-
ance in his duty for a fortnight of one of those
slimy invertebrates known as “bludgers,” and a
particularly vile specimen at that. Certainly he
excused himself on the ground that it was done to
get a conviction, but —well —are Victorian detec-
tives the sort of men who can afford to be seen
about with thieves and blackguards of this sort-
even in pursuit of information received ?
The Song of a Slave.
Long ago the Pharaohs bound you—
You were prisoners in Khem,
But the God you worshipped found you,
And he made it warm for them.
You were making bricks for steeples,
Using leaves instead of straw.
You were honest Christian peoples
By the reading of the Law.
By the raw galls on our shoulders
You are Christians, oh !
By the rough roads strewn with boulders
Where our tired feet go.
By the whirring brakes behind us,
By the dust that lifts to blind us,
Oh, our galling girths remind us,
You are Christians, oh !
When you set the blood-foam flying—
When the rowels rip and rake—
Nostrils red and ears back-lying
With a sobbing heart a-shake,
We are staunch young brutes, and plucky,
Who can pull tho’ collars choke,
While (O, people, you are lucky !)
You are godly Christian folk.
By the curse of blinding blinkers,
You are Christians, oh !
By the blows of sodden drinkers,
By the plated toe—
By your right o’er slaves in harness,
You may flog and saw and dam us,
And (it really don’t consarn us),
You are Christians, oh !
One in twenty’s rather galling
And far stiffer than it seems.
One in six is cruel hauling
With a treble set of teams ;
Yet you get your wheel-chocks ready
And you crack a silly joke;
Then it’s “Straighten up !” and “Steady !”
And “ Git up! ” —O Christian folk !
Oh, it’s “Lift, you scarlet somethings ! ”
O, good Christians, oh !
With two tons behind three dumb things
And a grade like —so.
And you’ll stand and watch us straining,
Maldpg bets that We are gaining,
Yet, this fact is still remaining—
You are Christians, oh !
Then it’s down, with breechin’ rubbing
And a back like half a moon,
And a silly screw-brake scrubbing
To a silly sort of tune.
With our hindfeet on our forefeet
And our haunches drooping low,
Sliding down on tender, sore feet,
Very gingerly and slow ;
With a Christian hand to “lam” us
O, good Christians, oh !
And a Christian tongue to damn us,
And a Ghristian toe
To enliven our down-going,
With our cramped-up lungs a-blowing
And the hot sweat black —all showing
You are Christians, oh !
Did they hang you on a curb-chain
When they looked you up in Khem ?
Did they stun you with a verb-chain
Or an adjectival gem?
P’raps they did and you’ve forgotten,
But I think it’s fairly plain
That your ears were not sawn rotten
By a boring leader’s rein.
Oh, you harness us so queerly, ,
You good Christians, oh !
And you love your lordship dearly,
And your holy show.
Like the Pharaohs you have bound us,
But no god has come and found us,
So you need not fear to pound us,-
Gallant Christians, oh !

SATURDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1900.
Imperial Federation.
It is Australia’s misfortune that its Common-
wealth begins at a time of feverish Jingoism,
when the public is not quite in its right
taind, and its head is swollen to more than
ordinary dimensions. Therefore, there is
more violent conversation than usual about
Imperial Federation, and about the union of
Australia being only a footstep on the path
to the “greater union”—that of the whole
empire—which is to follow. In Maoriland
the* disease is especially bad, and politicians
like Ward and Reeves and Seddon have
been performing in a lamentable fashion ;
but Australia has also its share of Imperial
Federationists, and their capers have of late
been distressing to witness as they pranced
beneath the full moon of' lunacy with the
political sky for a background. But, though
Imperial Federationists are numerous in
theory, there isn’t one among the crowd who
has proposed a workable scheme of Imperial
union. There have been suggestions that
Australia should be represented in the
Greater Imperial Pai’liament—the Parlia-
ment which must decide all the greatest con-
cerns of this country—by the Agents-
General, or by making any wandering Aus-
tralian M.P. who may chance to be in Eng-
land an honorary member of the Commons
during his stay. There has also been talk
of a Council which is to have no legislative
power, but which is to obtrude its advice on
hot and exasperated British Ministers when
they have important business on hand—a
Council of Irresponsible Bores which will rank
with the Peace Society, and the Methodist
Conference, and the Association of Collectors
of Rare Stamps, and the League of Seekers
for Curious Beetles. But Australia is cer-
tainly not going to hand over the most im-
portant part of its Government to a Legis-
lature where it will be represented only by
the nominee Agent-Generals, and by the
occasional dropping in of Jawbone Neild or
Ginger Clarke or Solomon of the Northern
Territory as he passes by. And the pro-
posed purely ornamental Council of Irre-
sponsible Bores is neither one thing nor an-
other. There can be no Imperial Federa-
tion without full arrangements for the ade-
quate and permanent representation of this
country on democratic principles, in a real,
live Imperial Parliament. So The Bulle-
tin invites Imperial Federationists to stop
their promiscuous cheering and their loose
waving of the Flag, and to leave the in-
coherent banquet and the enthusiastic
whisky, and look at the business aspect of
their own case.
* * * *
If there is to be a great Imperial Parlia-
ment representing all the Empire, it has
first of all to be decided that nine-tenths of
the people of the Empire shall be per-
manently disfranchised. Hitherto Britain
has skimmed lightly over the question of
drawing a colour-line and declaring the
vast mass of its black, brown, and yellow
subjects to be permanently inferior beings,
by denying Constitutional Government to
those regions where the black man pre-
dominates to an alarming extent. In India
the 250,000,000 or so of Asiatics have been
refused any self-governing powers by the
simple process of refusing them also to the
250,000 or so of Europeans, and thus putting
both races on something like a level. This
has enabled the British Government to avoid
a question which could only be actually
solved in one of two ways, both unsatisfac-
tory. And in many other regions where the
British subjects are almost wholly black,
brown, or yellow, the same difficulty has
been evaded in the same way. But
if there is ever to be a real Im-
perial Federation with a real Im-
perial Parliament exercising real powers
over the whole empire, this difficulty can be
skimmed over no longer. It is impossible
to have the vast mass of nigger States repre-
sented by mere nominees. Australia can’t
possibly hand over the control of its affairs
to a body which is largely non-elective, and
have its own elected representatives voted
down by Anglo-Indian and Anglo-African
civil servants appointed by the British
Government; that would be getting back to
the Crown Colony system in its worst form.
It is impossible to leave out the black-man
States altogether for then there would be no
Imperial Federationat all; it would not be
a union of the empire but only a union of a
fragment of the empire. It is impossible to
give all the people of the Empire fair and
equal representation in an Imperial Parlia-
ment ; that would hand over the control of
Britain, Canada, and Australia to the
colored races of India and Africa and put an
end to the White Man’s dominion. The
only way is to throw all pretence of equal
justice overboard, draw a sharp color-line,
and declare the Queen’s black, brown and
yellow subjects permanently inferior beings,
who must hold for ever the political status
of the slave in the old days when the white
man bought and sold and flogged his black
brother at his own sole discretion.
• * • »
Next it is reasonably obvious that the
present Imperial Parliament must go. It
is not only a Parliament which exercises
general supervision over the affairs of the
empire outside of the United Kingdom, but
it also attends to the domestic affairs of the
United Kingdom. If Australia, Canada,
India, Maoriland, the West Indies, South
and West Africa, Newfoundland, Ceylon,
Malta, &c., send representatives to that
existing Parliament the situation becomes
too complicated for words. Either all these
States must abolish their local Legislatures
and let the Imperial Parliament attend to
the domestic affairs not only of Britain but
also of every part of the empire, right
down to a question of a culvert in Far-
Western N.S. W. and a dispute about
a selection in Westralia but the posi-
tion is too absurd to be worth further
mention. Even a Legislature of 60,000
members, divided into two dozen working
committees, and sitting 48 hours a day all
the year round, could not carry so stupendous
a load. Or else the new members from all
the places above-mentioned must be allowed
to help to decide the purely domestic concerns
of Great Britain and Ireland while the mem-
bers from Great Britain and Ireland would
have no corresponding control over the
internal government of Australia and the
other places, but that arrangement would be
so one-sided that the British people could
not possibly consent. Or again, the mem-
bers from Australia, Canada, India, &c.,
must sit in the Imperial Parliament while
purely Imperial affairs were being con-
sidered, and be driven out like a flock of
sheep when a local Bill came on, to camp on
the doorstep, and catch cold and sneeze in the
British atmosphere, and wait till the next Im-
perial matter cropped up, That would also
be wildly absurd. To send members all that
distance that they might spend the best part
of their lives in being thrown out of their own
Parliament would be more like comic-opera
than serious legislation. The only visible
way is either to turn the present Imperial
Parliament into a purely British Legislature
and establish a new purely Imperial Parlia-
ment over its head, or to create a subordinate
British Parliament for purely British con-
cerns, and let the present Imperial Parlia-
ment be Imperial and nothing else.
* * * *
Assuming that the black, brown and yel-
low man problem has been solved by dis-
franchising, and leaving without representa-
tion,and wholly ejecting from the Legislature
about 95 out of every 100 British subjects,
it would then be necessary to consider the
question of representation. If this was
according to population in both Houses,
Australia, for the present, w;ould practically
cease to have any voice in the control of its
own affairs so far as they rested with the
Imperial Parliament. It would hand over a
large number of important Australian inter-
ests, and these would be managed from a
purely British point of view by a body
wherein there were 10 British votes to one
Australian. By way of compensation Aus-
tralians, would have a nominal share in the
control of British affairs ; they would also
be managed from a purely British point of
view by a body where there were 10 British
votes to one Australian. Of course there
would be one compensation. Some day
Australia, merely by reason of its size, will
have more people than Britain has, and
then in the representation-by-population
system it would probably shift the capital of
the British Empire to Bombala, and send an
Australian governor to rule in London. That
is, provided Canada didn’t get there first,
and move the whole business to Quebec.
But these are far-off possibilities. On
the other hand, the Imperial Federation
might follow the safe example of almost
every other successful Federation, and go on
the basis of representation by population in
one House, and equal representation of
States in the other.
* * * »
Either way the House of Lords would
haye to go. It won't fit in with any scheme
of Imperial union. If it is a case of repre-
sentation by population, Australia couldn t
put up with being bossed by 600 British
noblemen, all hereditary legislators by vir-
tue of being the eldest sons of some previous
noblemen, and all knowing nothing of this
country. Even if they were assisted by 60
hereditary Australian noblemen, who would
necessarily live in England to attend to their
legislative duties, so that in a generation or
so they would know as little of this country
as the British noblemen do, it would make
things no better. And if the system of equal
representation in the Upper House was
adopted, Australia couldn’t stand being
bossed by 600 hereditary British noblemen
who know nothing of this country, assisted by
600 hereditary Australian noblemen, and 600
hereditary South African noblemen, and 600
hereditary noblemen from Canada, and the
same number from India and many
from other places, making about 8000
hereditary noblemen in all. They would all
live in England, and their sons would be
purely English, and in a few years these
outlying countries would be as wholly
unrepresented as if they had never sent 600
hereditary noblemen to Londfm at all. Be-
sides, the Imperial Parliament would proba-
bly be an unpaid body, in which case this
country would have to send thither its richest
men. And if 100 legislators* worth, on an
average, £2500 a year each, thus became
absentees spending their wealth in England,
that would drain this country of £250,000 a
year —which is equal to incurring a debt of
£8,333,000, without getting a pennyworth of
value for it. This is a pretty high price to
pay.
* * * *
And it is equally impossible that Australia,
Canada, India, South Africa, &c., should
send elective members to sit in the British
House of Lords along with Britain’s heredi-
tary nominees. For Britain’s hereditary
peers would still have as much say in the
control of Australian affairs as the Australian
elective members would, and even in its
maddest Jingo drunkenness this land is
hardly drunk enough to hand over the con-
trol of its affairs to any body of hereditary
Eldest Sons. The British House of Lordswon’t
fit anywhere into any scheme of Imperial
Union. If Britain cares to wipe that body
off the slate, and establish an elective Upper
House chosen by manhood suffrage, wherein
the great States of the Empire (say, Canada,
South Africa, India, Australasia and Britain,
the other places coming in as dependencies
of these) shall be equally represented, and
let representation go by population in a paid
House of Commons also elected by manhood
suffrage, then it is possible something may
be done. At the same time it is seriously to
be hoped that nothing will be done. But it
is no earthly use for Jingo politicians at this
end of the globe to waste their eloquence
over dreams of Imperial Federation, and to
appeal to Australia to rise up and unite. As
long as Great Britain imposes an insuper-
able obstacle in the shape of a hereditary
legislative anachronism which can’t possibly
adapt itself to any scheme of union, there is
nothing for this country to do or to talk
about. Australia can’t unite with Britain
while Britain insists on blocking the way.
* * * *
The. Imperial union would necessarily
mean uniform Imperial tariff, and the
British majority, aided possibly by votes
from South Africa and India, would promptly
decide, in Britain’s trade interests, that it
should be a moderate Revenue Tariff on the
British model. This would probably wreck
a good many Australian industries, and
between the loss of tariff revenue and the
increased naval and military burdens it
would probably be necessary to multiply the
existing land and income taxes by four, and
impose house-tax and other British imposts
hitherto unknown here ; but, doubtless, the
really good Australian Jingo would gl dly
face that small burden for the greater glory
of the Empire. The Maoriland and S.A.
absentee-taxes would probably have to go ;
the Imperial union would hardly allow one
part of the Federation to levy special im-
posts on the people of another part. Ihe
alien restriction laws would also, no doubt,
have to go, in so far as they referred to
black, brown, and yellow men from
other parts of the Eanpire, and the
Hindoo, the Hongkong Chinaman and other
Federated brethren of colour would come in
free. The annual contribution of Australia
to the Imperial army and navy would be,
on a population basis, somewhere about
£3.000,000 per annum, increasing with the
increase of its people ; and when, after the
establishment of the Imperial union, a
purely British war the size of the recent
small Boer disagreement came along, Aus-
tralia’s share of "the bill, in addition to its
regular military and naval contribution of
£3,000,000 or so per annum, would be
possibly £5,000,000. If a purely British
war of really large dimensions came
•along, Australia’s contribution might be
£10,000,000 or £20,000,000. These are the
business aspects of the case. Ihe senti-
mental aspects —those with the banquets
and speeches and flag-flappings in them—are
being so well attended to in other quarters
that it is unnecessary to touch on them here,
and The Bulletin therefore confines itself
to the much-neglected detail of the subject.
* * * *
Lastly, if Imperal Federation does come,
and Australasia commits itself to all the
above chances and expenses, The Bulletin
trusts that it will be specified, at the very
beginning of the movement, that none of the
politicians who take a leading part in it at
this end shall be rewarded with any title,
bauble, decoration, handle or gew-gaw what-
ever. For it would be a sad, sad thing, when
this country faced the bill later on and had a
sudden spasm of regret for what it had done,
if it began to call Seddon and Ward and
Lyne and people like that so many mean,
degraded, low-down Iscariots, who had sold
their country for a title, and betrayed their
trust for dirty, sordid considerations. The
business should be kept clean. If it
is the kind of business which can’t
be kept clean it should be kept no dirtier
than is absolutely necessary. If it is under-
stood that the Australian politicians who
bring about Imperial Federation (supposing
it ever is brought about) will only get such
reward as Australia thinks fit to give them,
the position is fair enough. But if Britain
rewards them for bringing about an arrange-
ment whereby this country commits itself to
large risks and expenses on Britain’s
account, it will look too much as if they
were a crawlsome gathering of traitors who
had sold their country and were collecting
the price of their iniquity. So long as all
the titles and all the small decorations
for which the souls of our politicians hunger,
come from Britain, no title-hungry politician
can be trusted to take a fair and honest view
of any question where the interests of Aus-
tralia are on one side and those of Britain
on the other.
The Pour Freetectionist Treasurers.
Last Monday week those great New South Wales
Freetraders George Reid and Carruthers,
M'Millan and Bruce Smith, rose up at Sydney
Town Hall to tell the people strange things about
the blessings of Freetrade and the evils and draw-
backs of Protection. They are all Freetrade ex-
Treasurers who, while at the N.S.W. Treasury,
kept on quite a lot of Protective duties, and sur-
reptitiously practised Protection on a pretty large
scale, and denied that they did it, and denounced
the doctrine which they sneakingly followed—but
that is so very like the Reid and M'Millan and
B. Smith and Carruthers clan that there is
nothing surprising about it. As usual George
Reid was the most wildly unreliable of the crowd.
Some time ago the principal Australian manu-
facturers drafted a Federal Protectionist tariff
according to their ideas, with a view to laying it
before the Federal electors and the Federal
Parliament when the time came. They didn’t
publish it, just as George Reid and M'Millan
and B. Smith and Carruthers, though demanding
“ a legitimate revenue tariff,” absolutely refuse to
publish their proposed tariff. And the crowd
which refuses to publish its own proposed revenue
tariff calls the refusal of the other crowd to publish
its proposed Protectionist tariff a “conspiracy.”
But some little time ago a Freetrade organ got
over the difficulty by starting to publish the
hidden Protectionist tariff scheme of the Manu-
facturers’ Conference. And though it was
promptly notified that the published tariff was a
mere hilarious joke and imposture, with no pos-
sible resemblance to the real thing, the Freetrade
organ went on publishing unconcernedly. And
George Reid, who apparently must know, as a
man who is occasionally threatened with intelli-
gence, t..at tne Freetrade paper’s alleged tariff
was pure imposture, presented it to the public as
real, and, with his own proposed revenue tariff
still darkly concealed in Ins coat tail, asked the
community to look at the hidden thing brought to
light and shudder.
* * * *
This is some of the language of the man with
the Concealed Revenue Tariff Conspiracy, on the
subject of the Concealed Protectionist Tariff
Conspiracy:
But, before I close, I want to take a few items of the
secret protection convention, which were framed in Syd-
ney, and sealed, but not delivered. (Laughter and
cheers.) I will just refer to a few in order to show the
true democratic character of the convention. Harness,
45 per cent., harvest binding twine Bs. per cwt., hats
(men’s and boys') 3s. each, straw hats 35 per cent.,
hosiery 30 per cent., iron SO per cent. And, in order to
show the unmistakeably true democratic spirit of the
convention, let me quote this item —moleskin clothing,
45 per cent. (Loud laughter.) It is only fair to say that
these experienced gentlemen knew the inevitable result
of high duties, for they have got this down—moleskin
imitations, 45 per cent. Then I find these : Agricultural
implements 20 per cent., apparel 45 per cent., shirts 45
per cent., blankets Gd. a pound, soap 2d. a pound, starch
2d. a pound, boots (men’s) ss. a pair, youths’ 3s. Gd. a
pair, boys’ 2s. Gd. a pair. You see the beautiful discrimi-
nation of the protectionists—men’s, youths’, boys’. And,
lest you should imagine that they had entirely forgotten
babies, it is my painful duty to imform you that they
have put a duty of 35 per cent, on perambulators. There
are just a few more items I want to draw your attention
to. Women’s boots 3s. 9d. a pair, girl’s 3s. a pair, and
picks 35 per cent. Now, here is an item which shows the


entire liberality of this secret conference. They propose
a duty on imported spirits of 14s. a gallon, and an excise
duty on Boomerang brandy of 9s. a gallon. Now, that
difference in favor of eolonial spirits would cost the Com-
monwealth millions of money in a few years. (Cheers.)
The people of Australia are not anxious to take millions
of money out of the national Treasury for the benefit of a
few distillers. (Hear, hear,” and cheers.) Do the people
want that done? (A Voice: “No,” and cheers.) No,
they do not want it. (Cheers.) But it is the only logical
result of protection. (Cheers.) These gentlemen are not
to be reproached, because they have only promulgated
their creed honestly. (Cheers.)
* * • «
Apart from the fact that men whose character for
veracity stands much higher than George Reid’s,
because they haven’t been bowled out nearly so
often, have already explained that the above
alleged tariff is a plain, ordinary, election lie, with
no earthly resemblance to the tariff drawn up by
the “ secret Protection convention,” and that G.
Reid presumably knew he was helping to circu-
late what was wholly untrue, there are some
interesting points in that Fat Man’s indignation.
Just consider these circumstances :
This is the alleged Protectionist draft tariff which
*tlled G. Reid with righteous indignation.

Think of the blatant hypocrisy of the fat political
humbug who protected Australian wine to the
extent of ss. per gallon—-to say nothing of pro-
tecting all these other things—and then howled
with righteous indignation at the mere mention of
a proposal to protect Australian brandy, which is
made from wine, to the extent of ss. a gallon also !
* * * *
Then ex-Freetrade Treasurer Carruthers, who
kept on exactly the same Protective duties as ex-
Freetrade Treasurer Reid, rose and said that he
trusted “the people of Australia would join in
securing Freetrade in Australia, Freetrade in
the motherland, and Freetrade throughout the
world.” And ex-Freetrade Treasurer M‘Millan
asked: “ W here was equality, when you, by
years of Protection, molly-coddled an industry at
the expense of the great majority ? ” The follow-
ing list shows how the righteously indignant
MMillan mol'ly-coddled IN'". S. W. industries when
he was in office. Also it is how Bruce Smith
(who rose after M‘Millan and called himself an
“unconditional Freetrader” and said “the poli-
ticians of N.S.W. were heart aud soul with the
principle of commercial freedom ”) did likewise
M'Millan and Bruce Smith Protective Tariff in

Ex-Freetectionist Treasurer MMillan tried to
crawl out of an awkward position by stating that
“ We cannot go to the customs for narcotics and
stimulants without, to some extent, protecting
some industry, ” which is surely about as silly a
thing as was ever uttered by an alleged statesman.
N.S. W. charges 14s. per gallon on imported spirits
and it avoids protecting the local article by also
charging 14s. per gallon • on local spirits.
It hereoy makes the spirit duty a purely
revenue duty. It has certainly killed its
local distilling industry quite ” dead, but
it avoids all Protection so far as spirits are con-
cerned, and it gains some extra revenue. In like
manner it could put up the excise on local beer,
cigars, tobacco and cigarettes to the level of the
import duties, and put an excise on local sugar
and wine and many other things equal to the im-
port duties, and charge the same postage on local
as on imported papers, and thereby get more
revenue—much more—and avoid the curse of
Protection. The trouble is that not one Freetrade
Treasurer up to date has wanted to avoid it.
♦ ♦ * *
So things get back to the old point. Either the
four Freetrade ex-Treasurers, Reid, MMillan,
Carruthers and B. Smith haven’t among them
the courage of a mouse, and dare not practise what
they preach, and dare not confer the great alleged
blessings of Freetrade on N.S.W. lest its in-
dustries should thereby be benefited to death. Or
else they are telling a glaring falsehood when they
say that they are fully convinced that Freetrade
is the best policy in every case and all the time;
which may mean that they once believed it be-
cause they were so taught at school, and having
since wholly or partially found out their error
they lack the courage and honesty to confess it.
Or else they practised Protection on a pretty
large scale being quite convinced it was injurious,
and having a bitter and venomous desire to
damage N.S.W. as much as they dared. Anyhow
the Protectionist party doesn’t want them; it
wants men who practise Protection openly and
not after a sneaking fashion in the dark. And if
the Freetrade party wants men who talk its
doctrines and practise the opposite doctrines on so
extensive a scale it deserves to have them. Mean-
while The Bulletin reckons it will remain Pro-
tectionist a while longer. A creed that is so dirty
that its own life-long advocates dare not touch it
fails to attract this coldly-practical publication.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Something Wrong with G. Reid.
Though that remarkable man, George Retd, was
hardly in as good shape as usual in the matter of
unreliable statistics, at the recent Freetrade
gathering in Sydney Town Hall, he got off a few
hair-raising observations, and now and then he
almost approached his old form. Here is George
on the condition of the United States under its
Protectionist policy, as reported in Sydney Tele-
graph of 11th December :
I will give you the different classes of people of the
United States, with the effect upon their earnings by
taxation. The first class is the “ very rich.” Under this
head there were 118,000 families. Their sayings were
719 million dollars. After taxation their savings are 633
millions. Only 11’7 per cent, of their earnings are ab-
sorbed by Protection. Taking the “ rich,” numbering
101,000 families, their savings amounted to 355
million dollars; after taxation, 240 million dollars ;
amount absorbed by taxation, 32 per cent., or 20
per cent, more than the very rich. Take, next, the
“ middle ” class. They comprise 1,100,000 families, with
gross savings 470 million dollars ; savings after taxation,
227 million dollars; absorbed by taxation, 46 per cent,
more than “ very rich ” and 25 per cent, more than the
“rich.” I come now to the “ laboring classes.” They
represent 16 million families. Their gross annual savings
are 1620 million dollars; after taxation, 255 million
dollars ; absorbed by taxation, 78 per cent, or 67 per
cent, more than the multi-millionaires. (Loud cheers.)
No wonder there were “loud cheers” among a
Foreign-trade audience when it heard that the
labouring classes alone of the United States pay
annually 1365 million dollars taxation—this in a
country where the whole national and State
revenues in 1899 (as shown by that reliable British
publication, the Statesman’s Year Book for 1900,
pages 1164 and 1166) were less than 1000 million
dollars! And of this only 206 million
dollars was customs taxation, while land and
property taxes yielded 470 million dollars.
In the democratic 17. B. direct taxation yields more
than twice as much as customs, while the great
Freetrader and direct-taxationist, George Reid,
levied nearly twice as much in customs as in land
and property taxes. Just here The Bulletin
stops to give loud cheers on its own account. Then
the quaint Foreign-trader put his foot in it some-
thing awful by stating that sweating in Melbourne
was really almost as bad as in London. Truly, it
is a cold day for Foreign-trade when its most wild
and reckless barracker can only say, as his loudest
curse and strongest exaggeration, that the city
which is blighted by the worst evils of Protection is
really almost as bad as the great centre of the
blessings of Freetrade ! And G. Reid was wildly
triumphant and crowed like the early Cochin-
China rooster about the fact that there are more
women in Victorian factories than in those of
N.S.W. Apropos of which here are the exact
figures since 1896—that is to say, since the time
when N.S.W. became something dimly approach-
ing a Freetrade State for the first time—in other
words, since it became a Freetrade State with Pro-
tection for about ten important industries, instead
of being, as in Parkes’ and M'Millan’s day, a
Freetrade State with Protection for about 40 im-
portant industries
Victoria.

The real trouble apparently lies in the fact that
N.S.W. imports much millinery and undercloth-
ing and such, while Victoria makes more locally,
and the Victorian girl works the sewing-machine,
which she plainly shouldn’t do ; in a Freetrade
community it would doubtless be worked by a big
six-foot man. But Victoria seems to be getting
ahead as compared with N.S.W. even faster in
the matter of male than of female "workers; in
the last four years, since N.S.W. took to Free-
trade with more vigor than before, Victoria’s in-
crease of male workers was 2107 more than
N.S. W.’s, while its increase of female workers was
1709 more than N.S.\ ,’s. The Bulletin respect-
fully asks George R. if there isn’t a leak in his
theories somewhere. It would seem as if the
big spurt which Victoria made in advance of
N.S.W. only dated from the time when N.S.W.
abandoned about three-fourths of the great mass
of Protective duties which existed when Parkes
and M'Millan and Bruce Smith ran its Free-
trade Government. This is a melancholy result
to arrive at, but though the True Freetrade be-
liever tries to skip over it airily like a cheerful
goat on the mountain, it will continue obtruding
itself. If Reid’s policy of comparative Free-
trade has, in four v years, increased the
lead of the tiny Protectionist State in
the matter of factory workers by 3186 (mostly
males) isn’t there something wrong? Pos-
sibly being left in this dreadful manner is
Reid’s idea of progress, but it is hardlv the public
idea. When the Freeteetionist. ex-Premier had
finished jeering at the State whose industries are
increasing so much faster than those of his own
State under his own Jolly and Fat policy, ho
practically broke up. Certainly lie said some-
thing incoherent about the constant decline of
wages in the United States, but it was a very
small effort. In the United States the wages of
factory workers and artisans (men, women, boys
and girls all lumped together) averaged, as shown
by the official census returns, £5l per head per
annum in 1850 ; £OO in 1860 ; £63 in 1870; £72 in
1880; £lOl in 1890 ; and about £llO in 1900.
Under these circumstances a man like George
Reid couldn’t possibly avoid saying that the fall
in wages was large and quite obvious.
The Queensland Parliamentary Gag.
HAViNGinduced the Queensland Opposition to com-
promise on the proposed new rules for the appli-
cation of the gag, and to assent to a standing
order by which a debate can be summarily closed
by the vote of a bare majority, Premier Philp
promptly “turned dog,” as everybody who knew
him anticipated. He immediately proposed a
second standing order for the further application
of the gag, and used the first standing order
to prevent argument about it. Under the newest
system it is ordered that a Bill must be through its
second reading debate by 4 p.m.—discussion
ends right there, and a division is taken. Then it
must be through the debate in committee by 10
p.m. ; if 10 o’clock finds the House still arguing
over the first clause, then, as the clock strikes, the
other 20, or 50, or 434 clauses are passed without dis-
cussion. Consequently, if the great blunder or the
great swindle is put near the end of the Bill the
Philp crowd is dead sure to get it through with-
out being even mentioned. It is a great device,
and now private-railway Bills, supported by
wholesale bribery and involving colossal grabs by
syndicates of whole regions of magnificent mineral
country, are scooting through the Assembly like a
greased lost soul sliding down into perdition.
The new “guillotine” rules did their first
good service to the Boodle party in push-
ing through the Mount Garnet Syndicate
Railway Bill. The Labor party succeeded in
obtaining a number of valuable amendments, but
before the clauses were reached providing that
the State cannot, purchase the railway for 50
years, and that for all that time the co. can charge
one-and-a-half times the present Govt, rates
(which will probably be four or five times the
Govt, rates of 20 years hence) the clock struck 10.
Then under the guillotine system all the rest of
the clauses were put without debate, and these
painful subjects were not even allowed a mention.
Then Brisbane Courier pointed out, with the
mild indignation of a sheep, that the rates are
exorbitant and the 50 years monopoly an out-
rage, and it spoke quite severely, not about the
Government for putting these absurd conditions
in the Bill and for smothering all discussion on
them with its new Parliamentary rules, but of the
Labor Party for not discussing them when the
Philp majority prevented all discussion. As
every person of any foresight anticipated, the
big swindle was put in the hinder part of
the Bill, where it could hardly by any
possibility be reached in the six hours or
so allowed for discussion, so the big swindle
got through unquestioned. The Courier’s
lament _is that the Labor Party failed in its
duty; it should have let all the objectionable
features of the early clauses (including the painful
matter about shareholding M’s.L.A. voting on a
matter in which they had a cash interest) pass un-
questioned so as to get to the really important
point. But in that case the Government Party
could easily have talked about the early clauses on
its own account and filled in time. And even if it
didn’t, the huge question of the 50 years’ monopoly
would probably have occupied more than the few
hours allowed for discussion. The guillotine sys-
tem is a perfectly new addition to the Parliamen-
tary procedure of Australia, but though it is
revolutionary and experimental and so on, it is
wonderful with what cordiality the Tory party
accepted it. The Tory party just loves experi-
mental and revolutionary procedure—when it is
purely Tory procedure.
The Defenders of Mafeking.
A Tamwoetii (N.S.W.) trooper tells an unvar-
nished tale from the front: —
Our mates —the Rhodesians and Protectorates—were
disbanded yesterday, and it was about as disgraceful an
affair as one could hear of. They are fine bodies of men,
who go into fight in their shirt-sleeves —an example we
Bushmen soon copied, in spite of the bullying of one of
our officers. The London City Imperial Volunteers were
sent home at the same time as the Northern column, but
mark the difference. The 0.1.V.’s had a great banquet
and concert, and Lord Roberts addressed them, saying
they were now going back to receive the applause they
had so right y earned, and he said he was sorry that, as
their honorary colonel, he would not be in London at
their head. The 0.1.V.’s went down to Capetown in the
best of carriages. Now I’ll show you the other side of
the picture. In open coal-trucks, packed like sardines,
with a couple of days’ hard biscuit and bully beef, were
the men of Rhodesia and their comrades, the defenders of
Mafeking. No banquet or concert fell to their lot. No ;
even Baden-Powell, the man they had served under all
those weary months at Mafeking, had not the decency to
bid his men “good-bye.” And Lord Roberts himself
did not review the Northern men--the men who had
lived harder, fared rougher, and died as hard as any in
Africa. It will not do for a war to break out in Africa
for another generation or so, for the Rhodesians—in fact,
all the colonial volunteers—will take a lot of coaxing to
take part in it, as they will not forget in a hurry the cats-
paws they are made now that the war is over. They are
still left in the country in the hope of their joining the
new Transvaal police. Listen to the conditions that we
received in our orders, lined up for the occasion :—First-
class troopers, 10s. per day ; second-class troopers, 7s. 6d.
per day; third-class troopers, ss. a day. You have to
sign-on for two years, and then you are graded by the
military officials. Well, when our officers called on all the
men willing to join the new police to step out from the
ranks, the result was “ nixy,” for not a pilgrim budged
an inch.
Which about fits in with this, from an Australian
ex-trooper in Brabant’s Light Horse, writing
from Pretoria:—
The authorities calculated on more of us joining Baden-
Powell’s police. That was bad reckoning on their part.
Instead of us, as they expected, being glad of the chance,
every single man refused, and, what is more, practically
demanded his discharge. You see we only enlisted for
three months, or a reasonable period. This'move shocked
the authorities. It showed them our feelings plainly.
Then it was their turn to crawl. They made every in-
ducement in their power to get us to stop. Even went
so far as to offer us a month’s pay in advance with a
month’s leave and ticket to the colony if we would serve
another three months, or a £lO bonus at the end of three
months. They kept us camped here for about a week, in the
hope that we would change our minds. Did we budge? Not
us. Do we love the service 1 What ho ! We demanded
and got our discharges. So very reluctantly they cut us
adrift. Most of the boys have gone to the Cape. They
have learnt for the most.part a gigantic lesson. Volun-
teering won’t be fashionable with them. I wouldn’t
advise you or anyone else to mention it when the next
row' comes along.
Melbourne was the other clay treated to the piti-
able spectacle of a J.P. actually trembling on the
bench at the prospect of having to commit a push
larrikin for brutal assault and robbery. Said this
fearsome dispenser of the law: “It’s terrible to
be sitting here alone,” and again, “ It’s a painful
position for me to be sitting here alone.” The
prisoner was arrested immediately after the
assault with the stolen property still on him.
When a witness went into the box to testify to the
assault the terrified beak declared, on seeing him,
that he didn’t believe the man knew the nature
of an oath, and wanted to send him about his
business there and then. Finding he knew the
nature of an oath, the scared embodiment of
the law refused to take his evidence on the ground
that, whatever it was, it couldn’t possibly be of
any value. Being driven to take it, he tried to
adjourn the case. “Case adjourned till to-mor-
row,” he said; “I’ll adjourn this case till to-
morrow morning.” “ I’ll adjourn this case till
to-morrow at 10 o’clock.” “ I am going to adjourn
for half-an-hour; I’m not paid for being here.”
“I want to know my position.” “I want to
know my position.” “What's my position?”
Finally, when the accused was fully identified,
and the police had testified to finding the stolen
goods on him, this awful sample of mental paraly-
sis wanted to discharge him there and
then. “Is there anything to go on trial:” he
pathetically inquired of the police. “It
will put the country to great expense.” Being again
driven on by the remorseless sub-inspector he
asked the prisoner if he thought he could find £5O
bail, and hearing that he could, the affrighted
J.P. committed him for trial, fixed the bail at £5O
and fled. Apparently the unbridled Melbourne
push has got its honorary J.P. reduced to a >very
humble frame of mind by this time. The
spectacle of the gratis beak imploring tlie police,
almost with tears, to let him discharge without
punishment a man against whom there was a very
solid-looking case of highway robbery with
violence is about as pitiable a show as even
Melbourne has seen up to date.
♦
The manner in which Miller, Dan O’Connor
and other members of N.S.W. Leg. Assembly
were pushed on to the Supplementary Estimates
in the last hours of the session was a disgrace to
the Govt. The rule of Parliament, in fact, the
Constitutional law, has been that a member’s
payment begins from the date of his taking the
oath. If elected during a recess he did not come
under pay till the House met. Lyne and. co.
quietly picked out a number of such members and
made them a parting gift of the amounts calcu-
lated back to date of election. As a matter of
justice no one will dispute the claim of such mem-
bers. From date of election they have to look
after local interests and perform members’ duties
generally. But the Act of Parliament should
have been repealed in this respect. Instead,, the
Govt, rushed in at the last minute and, in effect,
made presents to a particular batch of members.
It did not include all. It established no principle
to regulate the matter in future. Further,. the
members thus profited spoke and voted in favor of
the estimates. The proceeding was scandalous in
all respects.
The collapse, for the time at all events, of the
Cloncurry (Queensland) syndicate railway scheme,
was a memorable event. It was also a very sudden
one. Kidston, M.L.A., stated in Parliament
that he could prove that at least one attempt had
been made to influence Parliamentary votes in
favor of the Cloncurry railway by undisguised
bribery, and Premier Philp, in a moment of pride
and rashness, declared that if the statement was
proved he would drop the Cloncurry syndicate
scheme overboard. There was a scrambling fight
in the Assembly over the method whereby the
charge was to be proved. Kidston offered to
hand his documentary evidence to the Speaker, or
to lay it before a Judge appointed to inquire into
the matter. The Government proposed it should
be deposited with the Attorney-General without
any definite agreement as to how long he was to
moon over it before anything definite followed: In
the end Kidston carried his point. Judge Mans-
field was appointed to investigate the matter, and
Kidston proved to his satisfaction that an attempt
had been made by a foolish individual, who didn’t
know enough to do such things verbally instead of
by letter, to buy the support of Daniels, once
M.L.A. and now ex-M.L.A., for shares appar-
ently vahn dat £775. That same night the corpse
of the Clove rry Syndicate Railway Bill was in-
terred in great haste with no discussion worth
mentioning. Nobody waited to start an inquiry
as to how many members had been greased by
the syndicate, but as Daniels’ vote wasn’t
sufficient to carry the measure, it is reasonably
probable that other politicians were “approached”
in "one way or another. In which case it is obvious
that the people would have to pay high enough
fares and freights on the Cloncurry line to pay the
cost of oiling these politicians, in addition
to the ordinary charges and dividends. A fine
large smell of boodle hangs over the whole syndi-
cate railway business in Queensland.
*
“ T.D.” on the present great Tasmanian syndi-
cate muddle: —
Tasmania has just struck another tremendous railway
muddle, and the unfortunate taxpayers of the Flyspeck
are called upon to get their incompetent (or worse) legis-
lators out of the quagmire at a trifling cost of £200,000 or
so. Ancient concessions made to the awful V.D.L. Co,
and similar philanthropic institutions affect the posi-
tion materially, but the immediate tangle lies in
the fact that the Govt, has built a 20-mile
railway to within 120 chains of a breakwater-
wharf, which cost the State some £45,000, and finds
it can’t get a foot nearer Che waterside without paying
enormous toll to an ancient and frowsy syndicate. It
appears that a Minister of the Crown, a few years ago,
signed an agreement selling the syndicate for £lOOO a
thousand-years lease of the water frontage and of the
breakwater, and thus blocked the way. Govt, officers,
including the General Manager of Railways at the time,
reported that the cor, cession was worth at least £lO,OOO,
probably £20,000. As the Minister who absent-mindedly
signed the agreement is now securely perched
in an elevated position there doesn’t seem to be
any way of shooing him. Even if that were -.pos-
sible it wouldn’t mend matters to any great extent,
for the syndicate has its bond and demands its pound of
flesh. As the only apparent way out of this horrible
mess, which none but a worm of a Government could
possibly have wriggled into, Parliament is being asked to
vote a quarter of a million or so to buy from a syndicate
a railway valued at about £150,000 in order to secure the
Government’s right to use its own £45,000 breakwater
wharf. The Select Committee to be appointed will prob-
ably recommend in a weary fashion that there is no other
way ; Parliament will vote the money, and members will
comfort the taxpayers with the assurance that a mere
quarter of a million on either side of the Tas. ledger will
make hardly any difference.
♦
After all, and in spite of the fact that, whenever
trouble threatened, Harassed Holder dropped
his measures as a guarantee that he wouldn’t do
anything to put himself out of the Premiership
and so destroy his Federal Cabinet chances—after
all the S. A. Parliament passed 23 Bills last session,
and in the list, too, were three or four good in-
dustrial bills, including one (here cited as an
illustration) providing for a weekly half-holiday
for shop-assistants. Kingston, no doubt, did
much to get these Bills through the Council;
but what did far more was the approach of the
Federal Elections and the consciousness that if
the Tories blocked these Bills the democratic con-
stituency for both Federal Houses would wipe out
R.C. Baker and other well-known Conservatives
who had been regarding themselves as Federal
certainties. And thus it comes about that S. A. is
the first province in which Federation has already
resulted in the promised more liberal State
legislation. But the others won’t be long.
♦
Sending working men, dependent on their labor
for the support of themselves and families, into a
non-paid Leg. Council is one of the blindest of
the blind acts of Labor politicians. No need to
take stock of rumors now circulating fn N.S.W.
Leg. Council; the principle of the thing is suffi-
ciently obvious. How can a man ask employment
from a member whose politics he vigorously
denounced the night before, and whose general
politics it is his business to keep on denounc-
ing? N.S.W. Laborists should have obtainod
payment for the Leg. Councillors before sending
their men in, or they should have agreed to diyide
their Leg. Assembly incomes with their fellows in
the Upper Chamber. If a pure representation of
Labor can be had in the Upper House without
payment of members for that body, then it could
have been had also in the Lower House —a con-
clusion Laborites have unanimously rejected.

“Carmen,” the third production of
Musgrove’s opera season, eventuated at Sydney
Royal on Saturday. It was a gorgeously staged
performance ; Sydney never saw Bizet’s old
Spanish tale more splendidly mounted and
dressed. On that hot night Seville glared at the
audience in reds and yellows, with the realistic
sunshine blazing down its quaint crooked streets
where a dog couldn’t cross the highway without
one-third of him evaporating on the way. It is
always summer in stage-Spain—that land where
the male populace are all soldiers, or smugglers,
or brigands, or tavern-keepers, or bull-fighters
and public slayers of cows for money, and the
female populace either does nothing or else makes
cigarettes. And Musgrove has dressed the im-
possible summer land of stage-Spain in a regal
fashion. The tavern where i'scamillo and
Remendado and Dancairo have their picturesque
existence and their dance and their liquor is an
especial dream of loveliness, and Remendado and
the others match it in coloring. (The stage
Spaniard ends with “ o ” for the same reason that
the stage Irishman begins with it; he is the
stage Irishman reversed —like a person with
whiskers on his feet). A vast number of people
pour on to the stage at the smallest provocation
tawny people in garish clothes and huge jewellery
and short skirts, who make up a vision of barbaric
magnificence, and prance joyously in public, and
are recklessly indifferent to any attempt to make
a livelihood. A great mass of unpaid soldiery
(the Spanish soldiery is always more or less un-
paid, and it is fortunate if the Government doesn’t
borrow twopence off it as well) tramps on and off
perpetually, and its clothes are totally unlike the
coarse bluish togs and the wrecked hat of the real
Spanish soldier—the hat that always looks as if
cats had been fighting in it. As a picture
Musgrove’s version of ‘ ‘ Carmen ” is all that is
desirable and something extra.
* * * *
And in a verbal sense it is at least respectable.
Agnes Janson’s Carmen is a realistic char-
acter, with a strong sweet voice and impressive
presence, though she doesn’t look quite young
enough or quite beautiful enough to account
for a number of things. Max Eugene’s
Escamillo is also a mature-looking hero—too
mature to account for the alleged velocity with
which he keeps ahead of the cow’s brother; though
he sings his part with a fine strong voice, and acts
it vigorously enough. Salvi looks plump and
beautiful and reasonably warlike in the uniform
of Jose. And good, quiet, unworldly, little
Micaela, the good girl who is left, as good girls
mostly are, and who gets lost amid the roar of
the red and yellow dancing girls in short skirts,
is wholly pleasing to the eye and sufficiently so
to the ear. But nobody towers very high in
Musgrove’s co., just as nobody drops very low.
It is a reasonably good, all-round combination,
surrounded by a large, glittering red and yellow
pageant that disguises all its imperfections.
* * *
The “Royal Pardon,” which was dumped
rather carelessly on to Sydney Criterion stage on
Saturday night, is a long way above the average
level of melodrama. Most of the materials, it is
true, are quite ordinary, the usual uninteresting
hero being sentenced, according to the usual
fatuousness of the inevitable British stage Judge
and jury, to lifelong penal servitude for the
murder he didn’t commit. The writer, after a
lifetime of persistent theatre-going, doesn’t
remember at the moment one single drama, in
which a British jury convicts the right man with-
out convicting the wrong one first, and generally
the drama closes without the right man being
convicted at all. In fact it may be safely averred
that the stage jury convicts the wrong man four
times out of five, which is a cruel and disgraceful
slur on British justice. The good point about the
“ Royal Pardon ” is that the virtuous man isn’t
seen pounding with a large hammer on a small
pebble at Portland prison for 20 years,
and being cruelly punished for insubordination
merely because he thinks disrespectfully of the
food, while the bad man is allowed to throw
crowbars at the warders with impunity.
Nor is he heard moaning in his cell, or
crying through the keyhole for his lost character
to be returned to him. He mercifully disappears
for a long, long time, and leaves the stage clear for
the funny man. Dampier is the funny man, and
he is so wholly unlike the regular stage jokist that
it is a pleasure to meet him. At first he is a
drunken schoolmaster asking for beer on top of a
high cliff overlooking the sea, and beseeching all
and sundry for a pint for the sake of Auld Dry
Syne. He is a learned drunkard of long standing,
who has seen many snakes and poured much
liquor over them to extinguish them, and it
is a liberal education to fall down in such com-
pany and be unable to get up again. Eater, he
takes to the tragic stage, and pursues the villain
in a tall hat, long, greasy hair, and a wealth of
Shakespearian quotation. “The Royal Pardon
is the only play the writer can recall m which
the conspirators are bowled out through
Hamlet, m * dreadful white belltopper, lis-
tening at the keyhole, or Othello being up
the chimney in low circumstances. Nobody in
the drama matters very much save Dampier,
and by good fortune that interesting character
gets a long run before the hero spoils things by
arriving and telling about his sufferings. John
'Forde, as a deformed and grumpy person who
needlessly says that he wants to be a bulldog, is
also an interesting study, but there isn’t much of
him ; and Miss Blanche Clements calls for honor-
able mention in places. The rest of the co. is
third-rate with a tendency towards fourth. Some
very good scenery is rather badly joined together,
and nas a regrettable tendency to sag in the
middle.
** * #
A great number of things theatrical hap-
pen in Sydney on or about this Saturday night.
At the Palace the Hawtrey Comedy Co. opens
with “ A Message from Mars.” “ The New Bar-
maid,” described as an up-to-date musical comedy,
is to be presented at the Lyceum with John F.
Sheridan and Gracie Wliiteford in the cast,
wherefore Con., the Shaughraun, will cease from
wearing his red waistcoat and his whisky in a
distressful land on Friday. Rickards’ pantomime,
“ Puss in Boots,” is due at the Tivoli. Fitzgeralds’
circus blazes forth on the same night at the old site
adjacent to the Benevolent Asylum and the bones
in the cemetery. • The Royal has a sacred concert
on Xmas night ; the Lyceum has a ditto, and the
Philharmonic does the “ Messiah ” on Xmas
night at the Town Hall. Also, Williamson’s pan-
tomime opens at Her Majesty’s on Wednesday,
26th Dec. In the ordinary course of events, these
would all, or mostly, be described in next issue,
but The Bulletin, owing to the frightful dis-
organisation of the mail arrangements, has to go
to press so absurdly early that it probably wouldn’t
be believed if it mentioned the exact day, and it
really isn’t sure what will happen.
* *lf * *
The Sydney Royal Standard Theatre,
under the Adelphi co., now boasts an orchestra
instead of one piano for its revival of “ A Life
for a Life,” a drama wherein the villain begs the
sub-villain to make his sister marry him. The
amount of influence the stage brother is supposed
to exercise is enormous. In real life he generally
knows nothing about the whole affair. There is
also a bomb-throwing gentleman whose tendency
to ameliorate the condition of the human race by
blowing it heavenward is referred to by various
people, who ought to know better, as Socialism.
The hero is accused of the murder the socialist com-
mitted, and having escaped from prison disguises
himself for seven long years as a stableman with a
bucket. Later, when he is chased into a drawing-
room surrounded by armed policemen, he suddenly
proclaims that the Socialist has confessed to the
murder, and therefore his innocence is clear. Phil
Walsh makes a good tipster, and the scene where he
declares that he gets soberer with every glass he
takes is sympathetically received by an audience
that would like to try the experiment itself.
** * *
Up to Wednesday night Lottie Collins, in
a gorgeous frock of coral pink, and sundry other
artists, filled in time in a pleasant manner at the
Sydney Tivoli, till the House of the Dreadful
Curtain went into retirement to prepare for a
tremendous outburst on Saturday night as “ Puss
in Boots.” This Shod Cat is going to be a big
affair; 200 people are engaged, according to the
advertisement, and Harry Diver will stalk abroad
as Mephisto. Miss Billie BaHow is to be chief
boy, and Miss Winston-Weir is engaged as Fairy
Queen. Behind these, a miscellaneous army of
Old Favorites will spread themselves in infinite
variety.

January 4 is to be devoted to a free
theatrical performance to the poor of Sydney.
Including standing room the theatre managers
offer accommodation for 8300 persons, but as
crowds of children will be invited, 10,000 will pro-
bably represent the numbers present. The
theatre managements undertake everything but
getting the audiences together, which duty has
been delegated to the Govt. Charities Dept. The
only expense Govt, will be put to is the issuing
and printing of tickets; the theatres generously
provide for all else. But great care will have to
be bestowed on the necessary arrangements in
order to get the entertainments safely through.
“ Floradora,” judging from its first-night
reception at Her Majesty’s, Melbourne, is going
to pay its way handsomely hereabouts. Much of
the music is uncommonly pretty, and many of the
lines are as bright as we got in “A Gaiety Girl,
which was undoubtedly the smartest of musical
comedies up to date. “Floradora” seems a re-
spectable blend of “Gaiety Girl” and “Geisha.
The promise of the first act is not fulfilled in the
second act, but the more suetty end of the pudding
is not without a redeeming plum. In fact, the
gem of the show—a dainty song and dance by six
girls and half-a-dozen men in ordinary “Block
garments —doesn’t happen till 10.15 p.m., or
later. This little lot of twelve well-appointed
persons do little else than form pairs during the
evening, but they do it neatly all the time.
Miss Grace Palotta, whose moderate singing
voice is her weakest point, acts with any amount
of chic in the part of a fashionable widow. It is
a difficult part to play, she explains. “ A widow
has to resume the modesty of girlhood without
being able to pretend that she doesn’t know all
about things.” Miss Parlotta’s air of er
educated modesty is beyond reproach, and her
conversation impresses itself on one’s memory.
Instance her remark that for the present she has
remained faithful to the memory of her first hus-
band, because it is easy to be faithful to any-
body who is dead. Lauri, as Tweedlepunch,
the phrenologist and impostor in general,
scores freely. Hugh Ward is all right
as the perfume-distiller, also Brownlow and
Kenningham fill their places. One of Brownlow’s
ballads might as well be dropped overboard, and
one of Carrie Moore’s songs is too long, but these
are not important objections. Miss Carrie’s pic-
ture of the amorous brown girl who grew up
among the other blossoms on the Floradora island
is rather thin and sketchy. Miss Maud Chet-
wynd, as daughter Angela, also represents capa,-
bility without strength. Pat. Bathurst, armed
with a poetic butcher’s knife, lends a gleam of
savagery to a tableau, and the dresses, scenery,
&c., are on the higher scale. Williamson’s Xmas
show will have bad luck if it doesn’t prosper.

Bland Holt, in liis wisdom, intends to
change the Melb. Royal bill on Saturday instead
of waiting for Boxing night. This is rather a
matter for rejoicing. “The Cotton King” is a
poor sort of a narrative as melo-dramas go, and
the principal things that happen in it have mostly
had a stronger happening in previous dramas.
The comic relief has a mosaic appearance as
though it were lifted in sections from four or five
different places. Bland Hoi t at the beginningmakes
a half-hearted attempt to impersonate a Lanca-
shire person of weak intellect, but later on he re-
verts tocockney character. Also Mrs. Holt changes
her brand of humor several times during the night
without visible cause or reason. Barring Miss
Harrie Ireland’s fresh natural performance of the
girl who didn’t get lawfully married before
entering upon the duties of connubial life, the
co.’s efforts all round are not worth the trouble,
and the present scribe lives in hope of never look-
ing on “The Cotton King” again. Saturday
brings “With Flying Colors,” which is Bland
Holt’s attraction for the holiday season. B. H.
thus far has always known how to hold his own
against all competitors at Xmas time, therefore it
may be taken for granted that the new show will
include several staggering scenic effects.

At the Princess’s they will run “The
Scarlet Feather” until Saturday. Of late Miss
Emmie Owen, the plump little lady who figured
as Tapley's bride, has been seriously sick, and
Miss Emmie Jowett is substitute for the invalid.
The change of Emmies doesn’t throw any new
light on the fragile show, and Melbourne has now
made up its mind that “The Scarlet Feather”
was staged merely for the purpose of bringing
Nellie Stewart back to notice in a good enough
part, at a not very vast expense. As a time-
serving production “ The Feather ” is probably a
business success, but from the point of view of a
public which expected a first-class comic opera it is
dust and ashes.
At Melb. Bijou the lady said to be the
original Georgia Magnet is still doing the things
that other alleged magnets have perpetrated of
yore. Which is to say that the thing she does is
usually something different from what was looked
for, especially in the case of the eight or 10 fat citi-
zens who start with the honest intention of
flattening her out against the proscenium. The
phenomenal part of this exhibition of force-
resistence seems to lie in the fact that the
lady gets away from the pressure and leaves the
deluded citizens to flatten one another. Next
Saturday (22nd) the Leonards and Pirie Sisters
will make a first Australian appearance in novel
acts of an unstated character, and Miss Lottie
Collins, the goddess of “Ta-ra-ra,” is to come
along from Sydney on the same date.

On the Isle of Floradora, where a wondrous
blossom grows,
Which is sweeter in its fragrance than the attar
of the rose,
There dwelt a crafty Cyrus who had garnered gold
galore
Through purloining certain secrets from the Dad
of Carrie Moore. .
He ran the perfumed island on an aristocratic
plan;
Each local maid was bidden to espouse a local
man.
But the Carrie he selected for his elderly embrace
Showed a violent aversion to his character and
face,
And his daughter, when he told her that she pre-
sently must wed
With the baritone man, Brownlow, cuddled Ken-
ningham instead.
So the autocrat was baffled in his queer domestic
schemes,
And the ballet shook their tootsies (O ! the ballet-
girls were dreams).
And the Floradora public, caring nothing for his
rage,
Sang a song of jubilation round the purlieus of
the stage.
Then the giddy story shifted to a castle home in
Wales
Where the damsels went on spooning with their
necessary males ;
Old Cyrus bossed the castle, and his fraudulent
intent
Was to still retain the secret of the Floradora
scent.
But Tweedlepunch, the palmist—known as Lauri
on the bill—
With the aid of Grace Palotta and a missing
Spanish will,
Upset the greedy plotter, if he ever had a plot,
And forced him to retire upon the millions he bad
got.
So Grace Palotta, widow, took the sinner to her
heart,
And Tweedlepuneh made music in the leading
comio part,
Whilst Carrie, plus the castle, fell to Wallaoe
Brownlow’s care, .
And Kenningham, the tenor, built a castle m the
And the other girls and johnnies of a marriageable
age
Sang the show to a conclusion round the purlieus
of the stage.
The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The S. Aus. Labor party was between the devil
of principle and the deep sea of expediency over the Iron
Knob (Broken Hill Proprietary’s) Railway Bill. Pledged
to public ownership of railways, it nevertheless saw that
the B.H. Co.’s smelting business was worth straining
several points to keep ; and so, leaving leadef Price and
one other on the brink, it plunged into the deep sea,
with many apologies. Still, it isn’t such a very bad
Bill, barring the badness of the principle underlying it.
Anyhow, the Bill provides for State purchase at any time
at a cost not exceeding the value of the material and the
works, which is a 999-times better provision than the one
in the Silverton Tram Co.’s Bill. The Labor party’s
trouble was that if it had stuck to the devil of principle
before referred to it might have lost a good deal of the
big Port Pirie working-man vote, which will be badly
wanted at the Federal elections.

After all tbe cordial assurance of that great
Protectionist-Revenue-Tariff Freetrader, Dry Dog Reid,
that there are no “trusts” or “combines” in Britain,
that Freetrade makes such things impossible, and that
they only exist in dreadful places like the United States,
it is interesting to find that there are now 41 trusts in
Britain. The disease is comparatively new, but Britain
has got it bad, 24 trusts being formed in 1898 and 1899.
One very fine sample, in the thread business, paid 40 per
cent, dividend last year. This year it pays 50 percent,
and adds about £500,000 to its reserves. There are no
trusts in Britain—that is to say, they don’t call them-
selves trusts.

The maddest men on earth to-day must be the
promoters of the Normanton-Cloncurry Railway, who,
after years of work and waiting, have now had their
private-line proposal dished by a silly attempt to
bribe an old M.P., who, after all, wasn’t elected to the
House. Philp knows that under Federation (although
the Federation will not immediately take over the State-
railways systems) private lines will be difficult,
therefore in the last fortnight of the session he put
through a batch of private railway Bills—Lawn Hill to
Burketown, Mt. Garnet to Chillagoe Junction, and so on.
And the Normanton-Cloncurry Bill would have gone
through also, but for the attempted-bribe stink.
Dear Bulletin. —Re the Y.D.L. Co., the 1000
years’ lease of the Govt, breakwater at Emu Bay, and the
proposal for Govt, purchase of the V.D.L. line as a way
out of the difficulty. Does the proposed purchase include
the Emu Bay Co.’s line from Waratah to Zeehan'? The
Emu Bay co'. can’t make the line pay, judging by the fact
that the shares are now quoted at ope-third the amount
paid on them, and as Tas. Govt, will have to take it over
sooner or later it had better take it over sooner, ere
“ vested interests ” have time to grow up.—West Coast.

The O’Sullivan and the Federal festivities are
attracting a large section of artizan labor from the coun-
try to Sydney, where men can get an equal wage under
better conditions. It is very hard now to get good car-
penters, bricklayers, or blacksmiths at Cobar, where
scarcity of labor has shown itself ini many ways. One
mine received tenders for an excavation with certain
brickwork, and between the first and second tender there
was a difference of £460, which amount represented more
than half the total of the lowest tender. The Federal
drunk is not likely to prove an unmixed blessing,
although it will be a very mixed spree.
Adelaide Steamship Co., after just a quarter-
century’s lif§, sends its capital up to £750,000, mainly by
the free use of the watering-pot. At first the little co.,
owning two steamers, had a modest capital of £lOO,OOO ;
then, in 1882, it went up to £300,000 by the legitimate
issue of new shares, mainly for the purchase of another
business; and now, with 38,023 tons of shipping, the
directors don’t think anything short of three-quarters of
a million looks Fat enough. About £200,000 worth of the
shares are to be held in reserve to be dealt with as the
shareholders (who knocked out the words, “or direc-
tors ”) may determine. The move at the present time is
only one more of the thousand preparations, which are
being made for freer and larger inter-State intercourse
under Federation.

£4OOO of it to the permanent reserve, if only for the sake
of the increased appearance of solidity that would be thus
afforded. The business remains about the same size as it

Since the start of the Broken Hill Proprietary’s
new 5000-ton mill, most of the Barrier mines have been
engaged in remodelling their concentrating plants on up-
to-date lines, and wisely show a preference for machines
which have proved most successful on the difficult fines
and slimes. The machines that can claim this distinction
are the “Luhrig” Yanners, as supplied by Messrs. W. &
J. Lempriere, of Melbourne. The South’s new mill will
include a dozen or so, and the Junction Co. has also de-
cided to erect a number of Luhrig Yanners as an impor-
tant adjunct to its large plant. Other mines would do
well to follow this good example.*

The National Mutual Life Association (Mel-
bourne) completed, on 30th September, 1900, its fourth
year since its amalgamation with the Mutual Life of Vic-
toria. The results for these four years are as follows :

Interest earned on
average Funds £4 17 2 £4 18 2 £4 15 10 £4 13 3
The most promising features of this report are the large
increase of business and the very material reduction in
the rate of expenses. On the other hand, there is again a
decline in the rate of interest earned on the funds, and
the claims have increased faster than the income. As a
result the addition made to the funds is much less
than in either 1898 or 1899. The National Mutual’s
total accumulation is now £3,175,911 (assurance fund
£3,092,870 ; and reserve to provide for possible losses on
investments, £83,041).
The assets of the National Mutual look reason-
ably well, with a few casual limitations. “ Properties
acquired by foreclosure, £141,029," is £13,000 less than
last year, which is eminently satisfactory ; foreclosed
property always suggests loans which have proved to be
in excess of the value of the security and bad invest-
ments left on the society’s hands. That dubious paper
asset (which brings in no interest, and therefore helps to
reduce the apparent interest rate all round),
“ Deferred instalments of Annual Premiums, £50,742,”
is about £lOO less that it was last year. The
Bulletin has hopes that this means that the de-
ferred instalments of premiums on new policies are not
being included among the assets, and that this
item is going to be allowed to die out. “ Outstanding
interest, £3247, is a very small item —which looks well for
the security of the investments. This is assuming, of
course, that the item represents all the outstanding
interest. One Australian life society (not the National
Mutual), to The Bulletin’s certain knowledge (and pro-
bably others without its certain knowledge) adds the bulk
of the arrears of mortgage interest on to the principal of
the mortgages, and only shows a small part of the arrears
of interest as arrears of interest. This makes it appear
that the mortgages are a vast amount better and safer
than they really are. If one office would lead the way by
appending to its balance-sheet the manager’s solemn oath
and covenant that the outstanding interest so described
in the balance-sheet was all the outstanding interest
(provided it could be done without perjury), it
would make a valuable new departure. Further, if
it was stated that “ foreclosed properties ” also in-
cluded all mortgaged properties in possession, even
though not formally foreclosed, it would be another
valuable departure. The Bulletin knows one office (not
the National Mutual) whose actually foreclosed properties
are not very formidable, but which is practically though
informally in possession of quite an array of buildings
left on its hands by mortgagors.
To return to the National Mutual, that institu-
tion has, among its assets, £54,020 worth of building
societies’ shares, and the constant failure to publish the
names of the societies where this Iqrge amount is invested
is regrettable. Probably enough it is in some of the very
few sound societies now surviving, which is all the more
reason why it should be specifically mentioned that the
money isn’t in some of the very many unsound ones.
Despite these remarks, however, the National Mutual may
be summed up as, on the whole, a sound and progressive
institution, and there appears every reason to suppose
that it will continue so.

The Australasian Temperance and General Life
Assurance Society presents its report for the year up to
30th September, 1900. It compares with some previous
years as follows
T. and G. Ordinary Life Department.
In nine years the funds of the Temperance and
General’s Ordinary Department have thus increased from
£114,252 to £236,627. Several facts stand out very con-
spicuously. The annual addition to the funds has shown
a's.eady tendency to grow smaller, and it is now very
moderate indeed. Also the expenses have a steady
tendency to grow larger. They have been as follows since
1892 ‘
On Total Income. On Total Income.
1892 .. £23 15 10 per cent. 1897 .. £27 15 7 per cent.

1895 . 21 6 9 „ 1900 .. 36 17 8 „
1896 .. 27 8 2 „
A concern which has thus almost doubled its expenses in
six years looks as if it was in a pretty bad way, and the
present expense rate is really awful.
* * * *
In addition to this the interest rate shows a
serious decline. In 1899 it was £4 19s. 2s. per cent, on
the average funds, which was a very respectable rate. In
190 > it is only £4 6s Id. per cent., which is a very
sudden and very heavy downfall. Last year the Temper-
ance and General’s interest earnings were considerably
above the average, and the excess to some extent made
good the tremendous expense outlay. This year, with
the interest earnings below the average and the huge
expense rate still further increased, the T. and G. looks
like a concern in a bad way. The actuary estimates that
the assets of the ordinary department show a surplus
over the present value of the liabilities of £34B4—which
isn’t much to accumulate in five years. And it would be
interesting to know if any of the surplus was accumu-
lated within the last year. Also if, all the five years had
been like the last one, there wouldn’t have been a deficit
instead of a surplus. Also, what show there is if future
years are like last one.
The Temperance and General has also an indus-
trial department, which shows up as follows :

Despite its large income the funds of the Temperance
and General’s industrial department have decreased in
nine years from £23,015 to £19,276. The industrial life
assurance business has some remarkable features about
it, especially when, as happened with the T. and G. in
1897, expenses alone are more than the entire income.
The investments of the industrial department appear to
have been struck by the same ill-luck as those of the
ordinary branch, and returned only £4 ss. 7d. per cent,
on the average funds ; and though the expenses have been
greatly reduced, they are still 68 per cent, of the entire
income. The actuary reports that the industrial funds
are equal to the present value of the liabilities with a sur-
plus of £l2, though it seems just possible that he has
taken a rather sanguine view of the expense rate to
arrive at even this small surplus. Taking one considera-
tion with another the present situation of the Australasian
Temperance and General Life Assurance Society looks
about as unpromising as it well can be.

The Kauri Timber Co. (Melbourne) announces
a profit, for the year ended 31st August, 1900, of £35,667
(equal to about 6 per cent, on the paid-up capital of
£585,000) and pays a 3 per cent, dividend, absorbing
£17,550. This is not so very bad on the surface, but there
are some very depressing circumstances underneath.
The Co.’s capital is represented mostly by its kauri forests
and as it cuts down its forests it cuts down its capital.
In making this alleged profit of £35,667 it has eaten up
£19,529 worth of its forest assets, and instead of deducting
this from profits (which would then be only £16,138) it
adds it on to an accumulated deficit. Then' the manage-
ment estimates a loss of £13,000 on the Co.’s holding of
Kauri Freehold Gold Estate shares, which further reduces
the year’s net profit to £3138. There is no reserve fund
but the fire and marine insurance funds, log reserve
account, officers’ guarantee fund and undivided profit
balance may be regarded as reserves of a kind. When
these are all deducted the Co. has an accumulated deficit
of £154,425, and including £210,000 written off two or
three years ago it may be considered that £364,425 out of
the original £795,000 paid-up capital has disappeared.
As the 3 per cent, dividend absorbs £17,550, and the real
net earnings of the year are only £3138, things have
grown considerably worse in the last 12 months. Yet
that humble 3 per cent, is the only dividend the share-
holders have had for a number of years.

B.H. Prop, steadily increases its milling
capacity. The co’s advices are that the silver-market
prospects are good. Junction North has improved a little
lately ; it is possible that ex-rnanager Phillips, of the
Junction, may manage this after the end of the year.
The Junction co. proposes to “do something” with its
Consolidated block; it is a long shot. Ditto White
Leads, at the other end, which after seven or eight years
has resumed under its old manager, Kneebone. The
Junction is keeping the pot boiling with patches of
oxidised ores, luckily unearthed. The sulphides continue
exasperatingly poor. The British still has no luck
with its diamond drills. Of outside shows in which
Broken Hill is interested two fill the eye at present—
Wertago and one at Olary, over the S.A. border. At the
former a reverberatory furnace has been started without
much hope of success; from the Olary show some re-
markably fine ore has been broken. What the quantity
is writer doesn’t know.

From Condobolin (N.S.W.) to a Sydney daily :
“ The recent decision of N.S.W. Full Court that all gold
and copper ore is the property of the Crown will detri-
mentally affect the owners of the several promising cop-
per shows on the Melrose-road, some of which contain
17dwt. of gold per ton ore, which was calculated to cover
all expenses of treatment.” The sender of this barks up
the wrong tree. No such decision was ever given nor
ever will be. The Court’s decision only applies to gold in
copper taken from mineral conditional purchases ; very
few of these remain in N.S.W., and this can be got over
by taking out gold-leases such as was done at Cobar years
ago.
* * * *
“F.”: Grassy Gully people, compared with
other N.S.W. co.s, certainly can show much development
work and at least some gold—more of both in a shorter
time than perhaps any of the others. This is not saying
much. All N.S.W. ventures are proverbially slow and
most of them duffers. Give the “G.G.” a‘little more
time to prove its ambitious pretentions to fortune.

Concerning Sydney Harbor Collieries Ltd.—
Not generally known, but still an admitted fact, that the
carboniferous area of which Port Jackson forms the basin
is intersected by two parallel main intrusive dykes with
offshoots. One of these latter was met in the original
Cremorne Bore, causing havoc to the surrounding coal
area. Natural gas was also struck. No. 1 main dyke
outcrops at M’Mahon’s Point, and may be traced to South
Head. Another is seen at Pyrmont close to the quarries,
and is no doubt identical with the disturbance at Bondi, '
for that is its trend. Question is what is to be the future
of the Sydney colliery? Will it be on a par with some of
the southern mines, or does the management hold
optimistic views as to the settled nature of the strata ?
Would it not have been better in the interests of all con-
cerned, and more especially of the shareholders,
whose capital is being disbursed, to have put down at the
site of operations, another drill ? The expense, say £6OOO,
would have been trifling compared with the huge ex-
penditure now involved in sinking shafts, providing
machinery &c. Balmain and Cremorne are two distinct
localities, although the Co. has the data of the Liverpool
and Holt-Sutherland Bores as its basis. The views
recently expressed by the chairman, when the shafts had
reached the 2000 ft. level may be verified, —let us hope so.

Ballarat of N.S.W. ! What a name to give a
mine ! No wonder it has gone into reconstruction. Ex-
M.L.A. Schey seems to have taken it in hand. Went to
Orange and carried everything before him. Number of
directors reduced from 13 to 9. Imagine any mine with
13 (lucky number !) directors !
* * * *
Sunny Corner Silver Mine, N.S.W. : The local
S.M. Herald man attributes the rumours of the re-
starting of this mine to the arrival of a small portable
engine, but he is somewhat doubtful, as other rumours
have so often been disappointing.
N.S.W. dredges. Turon : 31oz. from two. One
gave 250z5., and the other only 6ozs. Yet there are
people wanting to buy Turons at over £ll Araluen Pro-
prietary, 32ozs. Araluen Valley, 30oz8. No. 1 Macquarie,
30ozs. “ With the exception of the Turon the yields all
show an improvement on the previous week.” They will
want to show a much greater improvement to create a
new N.S.W. dredging boom or to pay divs. on outlay and
working costs.

Overflow, N.S.W. : Only another reconstruc-
tion. This time 75,000 shares of ss. eaeh, 50,000 of which
are to have a liability of ss. each. Money will go same way
as the last unless they are careful. It wants more capital
and better management to make the Overflow a mine.

The N.S.W. Pioneer dredge: The proposal of
Mines Department to refund some money to Garland has
fallen through, and a promise has thereby been broken.
When Garland started on the dredging business he paid
£1 an acre for over 600 acres, with the distinct under-
standing that the law would be altered, bringing the rental
down to something like it is in M.L., Vic. and elsewhere.
The Laborites insisted on the £1 an acre being charged.
under the new Dredging Act, and the Council confirmed
it, in its own interests, of course. Garland took up a
number of separated leases under the impression that
amalgamation would be allowed. This, too, has been re-
fused, so that Garland can be called upon to put a dredge
up on a lease of six acres. It is monstrous to charge £1
per acre for valueless land, and to charge the squatter for
good land in the vicinity less than l-‘2oth the price. It is
equally absurd to refuse amalgamation, which is allowed
everywhere outside of N.S.W. Anyway, these absurdities
are only in keeping with N.S.W.’s manner of doing things
in mining.

Cobar, N.S.W.: Several mines shutting down
for want of water. Drysdale has cleaned up about £2OOO
from mill and cyanide plant, and is bagging rich ore for
Dapto. Eldorado sending away a parcel of 60 tons ; the
Occidental has only a little water left, and has stopped
crushing. The Cobar Copper Co., ’tis said, has not more
than two months’ water supply, and probably will not be
able to arrange this summer to take water from the big
dam of Cobar Gold Mines, which property is in full blast
with 100 stamps all the time.
* * * *
Waihi, M.L. : October return, 11,814 tons
for bullion valued at £28,946, bringing total from the
mine to date to nearly a million and a half sterling. This
was the record month of the mine, and it has been
beaten by the Nov. figures, 11,000 tons for £29,673
worth. One mining man, whose experience extends
all over the mining world, and whose judgment is
respected throughout it, declares the Waihi mine to be
one of the greatest in the world ; it may, he says, some
day equal Mt. Morgan. Another important development
recently made—the striking of two hitherto unknown
reefs of considerable thickness, and much above the aver-
age grade—should considerably increase the output and
extend the life of the mine.

The Warden at Bulong has, amid the rejoicings
of the alluvial miners, thrown out the first application in
that district under the W.A. Sluicing and Dredging Act.
A syndicate had calmly applied for 1100 acres at Kur-
nalpi, taking in a multitude of existing claims, on ground
as dry as Pharaoh’s hat.

“J. 8.” to The Bulletin, from Phillips River
Goldfield :—“A case of vital importance to the Wes-
tralian mining community has just been heard in the
Warden’s Court here. This was the case of J. T. Cock-
croft, prospector, v. A. E. Morgans, M.L.A., lessee of
mineral lease No. 21, known as the ‘ Floater’ Gold Mine,
for that said A. E. Morgana did not comply with Sections
34 and 35 of the Mineral Lands Act ’92. It appeared in
evidence that this is a valuable gold-mine, but it has a
small percentage of copper at certain levels, and owing to
plaintiff not being able to produce expert evidence to
show that copper did not exist in the reef the Warden
considered that it was not proven to be other than a
copper-mine. Since the Warden’s decision there has
arrived on the field a pamphlet with the Govt.
Geologist’s report on this property, which reads :
‘ Floater Mine essentially quartz. Copper per ton,
nil : silver, loz. 3dwts. ; gold, 387dwts. 2grs.’ How
this will affect the Warden’s decision is raising con-
siderable interest here, seeing that defendant is a
strong Govt, supporter and plaintiff simply a prospector.
If in the face of this the defendant is allowed to retain
possession of this lease it is generally felt here amongst
prospectors that there will be no need for any man to
apply for a gold lease in future, but take them all up as
mineral leases, thereby securing 150 acres at a rental of
ss. per acre, with the labour conditions of six men ; as
against a gold lease at a rental of 20s, per acre for area of
24 acres with the labour of four men. The specially in-
teresting part of this case is that complainant did,' on 9th
Nov. last, mark off a 24-acre gold lease, for which he
duly applied in accordance with the Goldfields Act, 1895
(section 9). The matter is going to prove most inter-
esting to all connected with Westralian mining.

Queen Margaret (W.A.): “Melb.” writes: I
have known this mine ever since it was taken up by
Harvey Patterson five years ago. It always was, and is
still, patchy. Very rich ore-pockets are continually
found, but the bulk of the lode in all levels is only worth
a few dwts.; in fact, most of it is thrown on the dump
and never goes through the battery. What especially
distinguishes the Margaret from other mines is that it is
quite surrounded by a high, ugly barbed-wire fence to
keep off the common alluvial digger.
* * * *
Hannan’s Brownhill: Last month’s output
from 2,339 tons (the bulk sulphide ore) 6,7510 z. Though
this represents about the average production for the last
year the shares stand at less than half what they
were some months ago. The mine is known to be short
of ore in the bottom levels, and because of the depletion
of the oxidised zone the mill has shut down. Sulphides
are treated per Diehl process at Hannan’s Star plant, the
lease of which is up at end of year. They are erecting a
20-head stamp mill on the mine for the Diehl process.
This will be the fourth plant erected by this co. Going
back to the old stamp mill says as much for that method
of crushing as it does for the Diehl process itself.
• * • •
Lake View Consols: 2778 tons sulphides and
3614 tons oxides for a total of 56660 z. Working cost,
£11,966. Mine development, £3,292. On machinery and
.plant, £3190. Total month's expenditure, £18,448
leaving a profit of only £2402, and when the cost of run-
ning this concern in London and the numerous items of
other expenditure not included in this return are allowed
for, there will be nothing left on the last month’s output
anyhow ! Shares £l5 each, and there are only 250,000 of
them —which represents a market-value of 3J millions.
That is much higher than the Boulder which is turning-
out more than double the gold and which has established
its value at depth beyond doubt. Announced that the
next output, partly from the Diehl process, which is now
running, will be 12,0000 z., and the public is assured that
the estimate of a consulting engineer will be realised. It
is to the effect that the Diehl process will start with an
output of 12,0000 z., which will be worked up to 18,0000 z.,
and it is indicated that that will be the monthly return as
time rolls on. On the other hand, writer has it on excel-
lent and much less biassed authority that the tonnage of
ljoz. is under 70,000 tons with a very large amount of 10
and 15dwt. stuff, if that is any good to fall back upon ;
that the 500 ft. level is practically a blank to the Persever-
ance boundary, and the lode at the 700 ft. cut opposite
the Main Shaft is worth only 7dwts. (It was always poor
opposite the main shaft.) The lode seems to be'in the
Golden Link below the 600 ft. for the whole length of the
south lease. Hartmann, who is supposed to be a nominee
of Kaufmann’s, has been installed as acting manager vice
Nicholson, and people are wondering what this means—
whether it is Kaufmann on top or a combination of Kauf-
mann-Wright.
Ivanhoe : 6199 tons for 82050 z. Mine looking
remarkably well and should be able to keep up this out-
put for the next six months anyhow. It will be remem-
bered that it was given out six months ago that the
8000 oz. output could not possibly be maintained, that it
would probably come down 40000 z., and speculators were
advised to act accordingly. This has ail been proved
wrong, and writer has now great pleasure in kicking
himself over it. Management quietly experimenting
with the battery for treating sulphides. Extraction so
far not so high as that from the other sulphide plants of
the camp, but the difference is said to be more than com-
pensated for by the low cost of treatment. This mine
has less telluride in the sulphide zone than probably any
of the other local big mines, and, if what there is can
be picked out, the problem of treatment by battery is
practically solved. Telluride is a curse in some respects;
it would be a blessing to have the gold it carries free
from it, for, while tellurium is easily driven off by fire,
the roasting of the ore renders it difficult of treatment
because of the change that takes place in its calcite con-
stituents.
» * » •
Tindal’s Coolgardie : A very poor show, which
is doing some cheap mining in the West. Ore treated
during last six months only averaged 3dwts. 7Agr. per
ton, and cost of treatment was 9s. 6d., including a heavy
charge for water-purchase. Proposed to add another 10
stamps, and declared that the supply of ore is practically
inexhaustible.
*.
Associated : Prospects much healthier. The
drill has pierced a very good body of ore under the large
body worked by open cut on the Australian East
lode. It is probably 7 to Bft. thick, and the ore-assays
averaged over 4oz. This, with the other discovery made
some months ago, has kept Associated shares at an
average of 655. The “ bears,” too, have played their
part in giving a value of over 1£ millions to a mine which
has worked 12 months at a loss of at least £lOO,OOO.
* • • •
Perseverance : 2085 tons oxidised ore, 7330 z;
1174 tons tailings cyanided, 5670 z. ; 6827 tons sulphides
gave by amalgamation 42500 z., by cyanide 12950 z., and
by concentrates (45J tons) 5550 z. The average from
the sulphide is nearly £ an oz. lower than that
on which all estimates of profits have been based.
Cost of treatment is higher than expected, and
when the two things are allowed no wonder shares
have fallen 25 per cent. The wonder is they have not
fallen 50 per cent, because it is clear that unless the
average can be increased it is impossible for the Persever-
ance to pay more than half the divs. expected from it 3 or
4 months ago. It is quite possible, however, that by im-
provements in the milling and other directions a better
extraction will be made and an average of sdwts
maintained.

Those in charge of the Imperial troops on
the Britannic had the temerity to allow the
soldiers to stretch their legs on parade in Perth.
But they all walked in kharki. The jealous Lyne
Govt, would have raged had the gorgeous
uniformsof the troops been displayed in any Austra-
lian city before Sydney saw them. The pre-
sent N.S.W. Cabinet seems to have con-
centrated in itself all the provincial bitterness
of years. The invalid Governor - General
was practically forced by it to voyage 1500
miles by sea which could have been spared him
otherwise; also, having thus voyaged he was
practically forced to roast in the glaring sun bare-
headed during an exhausting and unnecessary
procession consisting, to a very considerable ex-
tent, of absurdly-inflated persons whose public
appearance is a signal for nothing but public
derision. The communications to the effect that
Lord Hopetoun was in a very weak state and
hoped the processional proceedings would not be
too long was surely a hint that would have
pierced the hide of an alligator.
On the day after the procession the exhausted
invalid who had been dragged round the streets
bareheaded for the greater glory of a mob of title-
hunting politicians, was “ slightly fatigued.” “As
regards ll.E.’s condition,” said private-secretary
Wallington r “in view of the scale upon which
matters in connection with the official landing
were carried out, it may be considered most satis-
factory.” But irony so refined is wasted on the
vulgar pageant-brigade. To them you could only
appeal with asafoetida or a club.

Ordinary folk were much amused at an
example of how seriously H.M. ships observe the
navy regulations which occurred during the
demonstration to welcome the Governor-General.
As the seven war-ships steamed slowly in line up
Sydney harbor, the flagship Royal Arthur, which
was leading, carefully took soundings every few
minutes, though her officers must be by now
absolutely familiar with every inch of the channel.
Each war vessel in the procession solemnly “ hove
the lead,” even the tiny gun-boat Karrakatta
being most anxious to learn if the tide (the water
was evidently deep enough for the big flagship in
front of her) was sufficiently high to enable her to
reach moorings.

To impress upon the people of Adelaide
how thin and frail Lord Hopetoun appeared
when he arrived per “Victoria,” the observant
reporter asserted that Premier Holder looked
quite stalwart beside him. And Holder, when he
stands sideways, is utterly invisible. It must be
sad for Premier Lyne to reflect that not only was
Hopetoun once Governor of Victoria, but that he
arrived in a boat of that name. Also he would
like to have landed and travelled by rail through
Victoria to Sydney, for he was desperately ill and
utterly weary of the sea; but theN.S.W. Ministry
would not stand that. The poor stricken Earl
had to avoid Victoria and give Sydney first show
even if his corpse had to be borne round on a
shutter.

A lot of men of the S.A. Fourth South
Australian Contingent, who were lately invalided
home, but have now recovered, are being ordered
back to the seat of war at the instance of the grim
Kitchener. “ This decision has come as a surprise
to the troops concerned, for they considered them-
selves as practically discharged when they were
sent home invalided.” It makes one smile. That
is the sort of medicine calculated to cure tiie Aus-
tralian foreign-volunteering craze.

South Australia’s returned soldiers had a

ing and kept standing uneasily on one leg or the
other for some time till certain politicians (who
had had breakfast) arrived and talked to them for
an hour-aud-a-half. The air was thick and
stifling, and the flies droned heavily, and the
politicians droned heavily also, and the contm-
genters stood with large rats gnawing at their
stomachs till near lunch time, and every one was
as glad as if he had just had his leg broken. The
yearning of the Anglo-Saxon to stand up in a
sweltering black coat, and put his ill-ventilated
black hat on the table before him, and make
speeches to anybody and everybody, even to men
who haven’t had any breakfast, is an incurable
emotion.

The Bulletin has often expressed its
opinion about those Australian swaddies who
boasted of collecting Boer trophies in the shape of
teeth, hair, whiskers, &c., and although tl ese
civilised Choctaws were condemned out of their
own mouths and off their own pens, the Jingoes
who had sensibility to appreciate the brutality and
ghastliness of that hideous mutilation of the
enemy’s dead, had the front to discredit the re-
ports as fabrications. Perhaps they will now
kindly explain away the utterances of Private John-
son, who was invited to address the elder scholars
at a Melbourne State Schoola week or so ago.
Private Johnson attended in his capacity of ex-
scholar, returned hero, and bright example to the
rising generation, and the kiddies were called
upon to gather about him and admire with all
their hearts whilst he described how the soldiers
of the Queen had demolished those godless and
disgusting Boers, and explained how he and his
comrades had gone relic hunting among the dead
and collected teeth and other human fragments.
The lecturer was the proud possessor of a Boer's
toe-nail which, he said with fatuous unconsciousness
of his own awfulness, he intended having mounted
in gold to hang on his watch-chain. No word of
protest was raised while Private Johnson babbled
these horrors into the ears of the children, and
the youngsters, before leaving, were told that if
they were good another pretty hero from Africa
would address them on the same subject in the
course of a week or two. It would be well to
know the authorities’ views on hero-worship of
this kind in State schools.

Petitioner Coningham is reported as pro-
fessing satisfaction, under the circumstances, with
the result of the divorce-case (which result, a dis-
agreement, is, by the way, what the cleric who
took the most active part in petitioner’s interest
openly said all along was what he hoped for.) “If
he (Coningham) couldn’t convict O’Haran, at least
O’Haran couldn’t clear himself to the jury’s satis-
faction. And if at all possible he will ask for a new
trial.”
If there is to be a new trial it should, in all
justice, come soon, for the co-respondent is being
practically tried for his life. He labors under the
terrible disadvantage of having had those incen-
diary religious questions over which the world has
wrangled for hundreds of years mixed up with the
question of fact, which question would have been
regarded as a comparatively simple one had he
happened to be not a priest, but, say, a softgoods-
man named Smith, and had the locus in
quo been not a cathedral but the office of
£ warehouse. Should a second trial take place—
and the fact that one may be demanded renders
the ease still sub judice and debars effective com-
ment —it is to be hoped that it will be conducted
before a judge who will steer clear of pagoda-talk
and remember that the only real deterrent to per-
jury is fear of the statutory penalty. The ordinary
man-and-woman trial is quite tough enough with-
out the interposition of the religious question.
The influ-
ence of ex-
Gov. Brassey
can be seen in
Chamberlain’s
correspondence
with 8. Aus.
about the sal-
aries of future
Governors.
The passage re
acceptance of a
Governorship
“ frequently
involving sac-
rifices for the
true, at any
rate, of a pub-
lic career at
home,” and
also entailing
“serious loss
through inability to
attend to property and private inter-
ests in the country,” might be a
quotation right out of Brassey’s mouth.
Onec ause of Uncle Tom’s failure was
the serious trouble he always seemed
to take to make Australians under-
stand that he had sacrificed himself
for their benefit. But the final tele-
gram must be Joe’s own : “ The selec-
tion of Governors depends on the salaries
offered.” That reduces the‘matter straight-out
to a commercial level. However, judging from
some of the Governors we haye had at a high
price, it doesn’t seem possible that the Colonial
Office could have sent out worse specimens if less
had been paid. Jerry Smith, be it remembered,
was Chamberlain’s own choice.
During the last two days of the Coning-
ham case the most startling rumours flew over
Sydney as to trials of a similar nature pending,
which involved high dignitaries of the R.C.
Church. Names, dates, &c. were quoted with
circumstantial accuracy, and so widespread did
the rumours become that steps were even contem-
plated for their formal contradiction.

An incident in the big divorce suit serves
to show the inequalities of the present legal sys-
tem. The jury, after several days of the trial,
demanded higher fees. The Judge replied that
he had power to increase the rate, if the contend-
ing parties, each of whom would have to pay half,
were agreeable. Co-respondent’s counsel at once
acquiesced in the demand, and hastened to proffer
payment, but petitioner had no money to pay
with and was forced to refuse. Consequently the
jurors were compelled to sit for several days with-
out extra fees. In the case under notice no sus-
picion attaches to the jury, but in the interests of
juries themselves amendment of the law in this
particular is imperative.

An interesting story in female veracity is
the case of an impetuous young person who has
broken out in a distinctly new place. She
registered the birth of an illegitimate offspring at
Castlemaine (Vic.), but later on she failed to ha,ve
it vaccinated at the proper time and the police
hunted her up to remind her of the omission.
They found her (but not the infant), and reminded
her. She grew so confused that suspicion arose
that the small unfinished citizen might have been
done away with, and a watch was kept. The de-
tective employed found out some really surprising
things for his trouble. He discovered the girl
wandering round Melbourne trying to borrow an
unvacciuated infant of a specified sex and age,
and refusing to say why she wanted it. Then he
found her going distractedly about the streets
looking at casual infants, like a woman who was
ready to steal one off a doorstep. Here the police
had an idea, and on inquiry at the house where the
registered child was said to have been born found
that nothing was known of it there. They also found
that the woman alleged to have nursed the mother
was blankly ignorant of the whole business. Then
they demanded explanations, and the terrified
girl confessed that she had never gone astray at
all, and had never ’had any child ! Apparently
she had just grown dead tired of the monotony of
being a cook, and in her craving for change and
excitement she invented the story of her own fall,
and registered an imaginary infant with much de-
tail. Considering how this country yearns for
population and worries over its decreasing birth-
rate, The Bulletin reckons that a girl who
invented some population, and sacrificed her own
character to make the birth-rate look better, was a
true patriot, and the authorities who committed
her for trial at Bendigo should be struck with a
cataract of bricks. Bail, by the way, is £lOO.
Same week a Melbourne ruffian, who robbed and
nearly murdered a fellow-citizen, had his bail
fixed at £5O.

Again the Salvation Army fights the rela-
tives of the late lamented at law for the cash.
The Bible tells you to suffer yourself to be de-
frauded, but the Harmy isn’t built that way.
ABSENT-MINDED.
DISTRESSED CITY BUSHMAN : “ Could you spare
a copper, sir? I was not always like this.”
BENEVOLENT LOOKING PARTY: “ No; last time I
saw you ’twas your other arm you had in
the sling,”
The fact that the will of Miss Jenkins, the
eccentric old lady of Long Reef (Manly, N.S.W.)
who left all her wealth to the Salvation Army,
has been upset, will gratify many people who
never saw her or the person who now succeeds to
the property. The Army is beginning to build
up an odorous repetition as a hungry, earth-
grabbing organisation and a great ecclesiastical
pie-biter. Further, it is known as a sect where the
boss Booths travel in special trains and are bloated
with lucre, while the lower grade clergy are worse
paid than the poorest kind of Anglican curate or
R.C. priest. Then it hasn’t the stately old
traditions of these other churches to disguise its
squalor, unless the great, red, Hebraic nose of
Booth can be called a tradition. It is a con-
cern whose so-called charity is the meanest
kind of sweating. Tt is an absentee land-
lord, for all its goods and effects are
owned by the dreadful Booth, and when
this country is better ordered that pawnbroker-
like gentleman will be deservedly struck by an
absentee-tax. Its drum is discordant; its church
architecture is mean and unpicturesque; it takes
the bread out of the mouths of poor washerwomen
and seamstresses by doing their work for less than
living rates, getting its labor gratis in the name
of Benevolence. It is getting an evil repute as a
hanger-on at the gates of affluent and weak-
minded persons whose property it grabs, giving in
return a coarse kind of spiritual consolation and a
discordant hallelujah. Its refuges throw out the
suppliant who hasn’t the necessary threepence or
sixpence as remorselessly as does the pub. or the
ordinary doss-house ; —therefore, being purely com-
mercial, their alleged “charity” looks very like
a disgusting fraud. The Army, in short, has
grown to be a Great Ecclesiastical Bagman of the
most sordid and baggy order, and a diseased and
snuffling autocracy, and Booth; as a very rich man
who has made his pile out of a church, is just
about as respectable as a very rich man who has
made his pile out of a brewery.
The methods of the Salvation Army
received a bad showing up at Collingwood
court the other day when an elderly crank
was charged with leading a little girl
into a park. Accused was an inmate
of the Prison Gate brigade home and
was in a filthy state when arrested.
Harmy officer came forward to refute the \
allegations of neglect, whereat a beak
asked “Does he earn more than the cost
of his keep?” “ Yes” responded the Sal-
vationist, “or we would not allow him the 4s.
a week we do.” The beak smiled. “ Then,”
lie said, “ the place makes a profit out of
the labor of these men you keep, who may
be a menace to the neighbourhood, just for
your own profit.” The Salvation Army
is mostly a big profit-making institution and
people who have no money to get or no labor to
be sweated out are not welcome to it.

Dear Bulletin. —Recently
met Melb. detective O’Donnell
(shot some time back by an un-
known in Carlton Gardens) and was
shocked at the difference between
the vigorous man of a few months
back and the skeleton of to-day.
The bullet is in his spine. Re-
move it and he dies; leave it
there and he is useless. But
they can’t retire him, so he
remains on the sick-list for life —
unless he chooses to take the
same pension as a healthy man,
who has no bullet to rankle in his
Spinal column. Surely the Govern -
.ent should give him full pay for life,
r a sum in addition to his pension
that will compensate for loss of
employment and disablement on duty.

• The Sydney Sabbath-breaking banana has
been too much for Lyne and See, just as it was
for ox-merchant Sunday Brunker before them.
They had the better of it for about a month, and
then the banana got them down and worried
them, and they let go, and were sorry they ever
touched it. Now the ungodly fruit is in full blast
again, no one heeding or hindering. Yet there
was no visible disturbance or riot or loss of popu-
larity over Lyne’s spasm of holiness, and to all
appearance, for all the public cared, he might
have kept the Sabbath fruit-shops closed for
years without serious objection. Apparently
there is some subtle quality in the Sunday banana
which enables it to achieve its purpose without
outward manifestations. Plenty of N.S.W.
politicians can stick well enough to much more
unpopular causes, but apparently there isn’t one
of them who can prevent the dingy Italian selling
his vegetables for more than three Sundays conse-
cutively.

In S. Aus. the ratepayers elect the Mayor,

A really obliging and considerate person
is Mrs. Dunkley, who, at Collingwood (Melb.)
court recently sued her husband for maintenance.
The couple had been married away back in ’B9,
and lived more or less happily till ’95, when a
Delilah of a domestic servant began trifling with
hubby’s seasoned affections. The gentleman told
the court that the damsel “did him good,” and
that “he went to his work in the mornings a
different man, whereas he always used to feel sick
before.” Also he assured the bench that “the
girl had been willing to go, but his wife, seeing
how much she improved his condition, begged
him to keep her on.” Anyhow she stopped on,
and in due time the natural little stranger arrived.
Afterwards more l.s.’s kept happening along—till
now eight of them are on hand. After the fourth
arrival, however, the couple separated, first_ care-
fully drawing-up a decree nisi thusly : “ This is to
certify that I Thomas Dunkley do not hold Ellen
Dunkley by marriage-law; that she may marry
whom she may without my interference in any
way; signed Thomas Dunkley.” The wife
gave her husband a similar document, but has now
apparently concluded that the arrangement won’t
hold water and has obtained a maintenance order
for £1 a week.
Adelaide is pressed for cemetery-room.
The original graveyard at West Terrace was
filled years ago, and those who had the fore-
sight to die while there was space strongly
object to being hustled now. Parliament
has been quarrelling over the question
of extending the area by enclosing an
additional stretch of park lands ad-
joining the present necropolis, but
local residents, who are already
favored with an assertive soap-factory,
protest that it is hard enough to stand
the present accumulation of deceased
persons when the west wind blows,
and urge that some other district
should be given a turn. And so the
matter stands over.
The amended rule re capital cases in
N.S.W. stands thus: The case of the capitally-
sentenced person is considered by the Minister
for Justice, with the Judge’s notes of the evidence
as an aid ; the Minister’s report is submitted to
the Cabinet, that body considering it, with the
aid of the Judge in person, and a decision is
arrived at; then the Executive meets and pro-
nounces the final 'result. It is unfortunate that
sometimes the Judge’s notes, the Judge himself
and the head of the Executive represent the
intelligence of but one person.
On Wednesday (19th), this week, the
foundation-stone of a Greek Orthodox Church was
to be laid in Melbourne. Up to now, the Greeks
of Australia have nowhere had a tabernacle of
their own wherein to orthodox, so their children
in many cases have been sent to find salvation in
one or other of the heretical ’isms. It is hoped
that the erection of one true church will induce
the Melb. Greeks, at any rate, to conduct their
fruit and oyster businesses on more strictly
respectable principles. The habit of placing good
fruit on top and cronk fruit underneath may be
orthodox enough, but it is none the less contrary
to Christian religion.

On Tuesday evening week, while nearing
Port Phillip Heads, on the Homeward journey, in
clear weather and on a calm sea, the 6000-ton
Ormuz collided with the 4000-ton 8.1. Ismailia.
Both ships were badly damaged about the bows,
the Ormuz having all her higher bow-plates sprung
and bent, and a hole stove in on the port side.
All responsible officers have taken liberal doses of
sealing-wax, pending the inquiry, and none of the
passengers can give any answer to “How and
why.” Apparently the smash was due to that
inborn cussedness of inanimate things which leads
two ships having an whole ocean to wander in to

There is no regular inspection of meat
killed at the Adelaide city abattoirs ; and so
pleasant things like this happen :
Correspondence was laid before the Central Board of
Health at its meeting 1 on Wednesday with reference to a
cow at Unley, which the chief inspector of cattle, Mr.
Desmond, had reported to be suffering from chronic
tuberculosis, and which the board on such report had
decided should be killed under official supervision.
When Mr. Desmond proceeded to Unley to give effect to
the board’s decision he found that the cow had been
slaughtered at the city slaughterhouse, and that the flesh
had been disposed of for human consumption.
The N.S.W. Leg. Council did one good thing,
anyhow, last session. When the Socialistic
Broken Hill town council asked for a Bill author-
ising the erection of abattoirs and other things,
the Leg. Council plugged in a clause that the
maintenance of a competent inspector should be a
first charge on the profits from the abattoirs.

A WOMANS LETTER.
Sydney, December 18, 1900.
My Dear Myee.—
At Lord Hopetoun’s welcome, innumerable
people rushed off before breakfast, sailed out to the
Heads, met big waves, and added themselves to
the general invalidity of the proceedings.
Aesthetically, the Welcome was a lovely sight—
white yachts in the morning sunlight, Govt,
launches, rowing boats, ferry boats, green dancing
waves, the sky the bluest of things blue, the shores,
the greyest of things green. The procession on,
the water was a mile long, and beautiful to look
at.
At the landing, too, the scene was mournfully
pretty. A white kiosk reared itself at the water’s,
edge, a little, open, graceful kiosk, wreathed in
flowers, with white steps and flowers, and four-
more or less Federal names—four only—engraved 1
about its ceiling. In place of a wharf a floating
pontoon made a gay note among the waves with
its draperies of yellow and pale blue, and a crim-
son carpet across its canvas floor. Palms waved in
the breeze. Such a blue sky overhead, and the
air sweet with flower scents from the Gardens,
round.
But, when on to the pontoon limped a wasted
man, clinging to a stick, all the gaiety vanished, the-
brightness went out of the scene. Not a smile oil!
anyone’s face, not a cheer. Tramp, tramp,,
tramp, the limping figure, the solemn, speechless,,
heavy-footed Ministry, the aides, the reporters,,
from the pontoon to the kiosk, in ahsolute silence.
Now toll me, where was the lovingness, the-
loyalty, the warmth, the kindliness, in that pain-
ful, nervous, overwrought little scene ?
That poor little countenance under the
feathered hat, what a painful protest, in its
well-bred way ! Its owner suffered a severe facial
spasm before he mustered up each smile. His.
wan face, just skin and bone, looked tiny and
pinched, great veins stood out on his forehead,
and the effort of moving a few yards along the.
red carpet and up two steps into the kiosk quite
exhausted him. In the kiosk, he dropped
weakly on to a chair. The Ministry hovered
about. Mayor Harris was introduced.
Secretary Wallington was looked to appeal-
ingly. At last the carriage drove along.
Leaning on his stick, bent, shrivelled, but evi-
dently very game, the Governor-General half-
crawled, half-fell into the seat. Plucking up his
spirit again, his keen eye went round for familiar
faces. The painful contraction that takes the
place of a smile just now flashed left and right,
and the ambulance set off.
Secretary Wallington, beside the grey, pinched
face in the carriage, looked more like a red stone
Wall than ever. He eyed things eagle-fashion,,
and hurried the carriage off with necessary haste.
What a heavy-footed Ministry is ours ! Plump,
plump, plump ! Not an instep among them-
Only the Attorney-General (but he was a cham-
pion runner in his day) moves with a jaunty step.
The footfalls of the rest were painfully, sugges-
tively funereal at Saturday’s show.
The picture of pink health and amiable scorn,
Mr. Reid took his hat off to air his feelings. The
sunlight on his head revealed hair voung and
golden as a child’s. Or was that why he took his
hat off ? Near him, Edmund Barton’s dark locks
showed heavily - whitening crops, in spite of
Georgie’s six years seniority.
Have you heard that Lady Hopetoun is to
be “Your Excellency,” and that etiquette at
Govt. House is going to be whale-boned in and
out ? Invitations to Cat Shows at Woolloomooloo
will not even be regretfully declined, and only
Shows with a national meaning will be vice-
regally patronised. Generally speaking, that is;
I suppose the State Gov. will be used to open
oysters, calf’s-foot-jelly shows and suburban
concerts.
A society wedding that came off at St. Mark’s,
Darling Point, last Monday, was that of pretty
Miss Ida Gillies and Lieutenant Bernard, of the
Royal Arthur, with Miss Mabel Lawley and Miss
Winifred Austen as bridesmaids in frilly white mus-
lin dresses, with cream and blue toques The wed-
dingreception was held at Mrs. Villeneuve Smith’s
house, whence the bride set out for a honey-
moon at National Park, in a cream satin and lace
blouse, cream canvas skirt, and little blue crepe
de chine toque.
You will not associate a Parsonage with
44 Carmen,” but it’s in a grey-stone house at
Wynyard-square, lately the home of a well-known
archdeacon, that I find Agnes Jansen. I must
hasten to add that the Parsonage is now a board-
ing-house, where Carmen dines operatically at
4 o’clock. At the time of my call she wore simple,
Frenchy clothes —a dark-blue skirt, white lace
blouse, and little white hat trimmed with grapes.
Her eyes are blue, seen close, and her brown hair
is brushed straight off. She isn’t a very young
woman, and her talk is consequently interesting.
She asks not to play Wagner till she’s fifty. If
you think she means that a woman doesn’t know
enough to sing and feel Wagner till she’s fifty
you are wrong. It is to save her voice from
the wear and tear of Wagner music that she
propounds this theory. But at fifty, when a
voice nears the passe, and hasn’t much to lose —
Wagner’s views on this would add to the
interest of the discussion, but unfortunately
Wagner’s dead. A warm, quick temperament
and easy flow of English tinged with a piquant
foreign accent, characterise the intensely dramatic
contralto who has taken Sydney by storm, as she
took Melbourne. By the way, she finds Mel-
bourne houses more critical, and yet more respon-
sive, than Sydney audiences. By birth a Swede,
she has Scandinavian literature at her fingers’
ends and adores Ibsen, who in the flesh is hale and
fresh-looking and full of life. She saw Nance
O’Neil’s Hedda, and placed her higher than five
other actresses in the same part. In fact, she is
one of Nance’s warmest admirers. You will be
glad to hear that Carmen has no favorite plays or
operas, no favorite books, no favorite artists.
It’s so much wiser.
The new music is Christmassy, and opens with
44 Paling’s Annual.” The Yorks smile from the
blue cover, and inside Maud Fitzstubbs keeps up
the firm’s loyalty with “The Duchess Waltz.” I
think this valse is hardly up to our most gifted
waltz-writer’s usual form, not too tuneful, and
calculated to lead weak-minded piano-pounders to
bang. But the “Annual” is well worth purchas-
ing for the sake of—among sixteen other items —
“ Ma Honey Sweetheart,” Lottie Moore’s coon
.song, and “Give Him the Moon to Play With.”
The “Myola Gavotte” (Paling and Co.), by Zara
Strahan, shows that people do write gavottes still,
;and not on new lines, either.
Nicholson and Co. send me “ The Sleepy Man,”
a lullaby song by F. Wynne Jones, graced with
pretty words, and music that takes some knowing
before you like it. From Mozart Allen comes a
breath of the past, a reminiscence of one’s youth,
called “ Scottish Pearls,” a little fantasia of
Scotch aiis simply strung together. A tuneful,
but mournful song comes from the composers,
Geo. Hobart and Thos. H. Rabbets. It is called
“ The Return,” and is written to keep green the
memory of the badly-treated Ben. Harkus.
Among the many sensations of the Coningham
divorce case, last week, was the male witness who
.swore to Mrs. Coningham’s being dressed in black.
A little cross-questioning, and his certainty fell
from him like a mantle, until, after contradicting
himself several times, he finally achieved
the remarkable statement that she was wearing
something “ darkish-lightish .” To a woman, a
man’s ignorance about clothes and colors always
savours just a little of affectation. However, I
suppose the feminine attitude to finance is just as
baffling to male minds. I have just heard of a
woman who received a notification from the bank
that her account was overdrawn, and promptly
rectified matters by writing a cheque, signing it,
.and paying it in with the thankful belief that things
were squared by that transaction.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
44 Melbourne’s ravenous appetite for free shows
was amusingly expressed last week in the rush
for admission to Prahran Town Hall, when the
Orpheus Society gave its Inaugural Concert. To
ensure a crowded audience the society scattered
invitations right and left without the least regard
for consequences. Scores of bareheaded women
and swallow-tailed men, on arriving at the hall
door with their invitation cards, found themselves
shut out, whilst ticket-holders in superfluity were
meanwhile squeezing for reserved seats inside.
Scores, in fact, had gone away disgusted long be-
fore President Sargood came to turn on the in-
auguration at the meter. The drapery knight,
after being duly ushered through the remaining
mob of rejected invitees, started proceedings by
presenting a gorgeous baton to conductor Fred
Clutsam. Then came the concert, which was
quite good enough to suggest that the Orpheus
will probably go on and prosper. Any musical
society that includes only one Wagner item (the
4 Tannhauser ’ March) in its first concert is a satis-
factory corrective to the gloomy fanaticism of
Marshall Hall’s adorers, who, for the most part,
suffer horrible tortures in their master’s cause.
Clutsam appears to be fairly catholic in his musi-
cal views. He doesn’t look for the beginning and
end of culchaw in the tunes the cat died of.
“Nellie Stewart wears her ropes of turquoises
in the street. She also persists in wearing her
large hat—a feathered verandah—low down over
her right eye. The latter is a very ugly style,
which is unfortunately being copied by the kind
of gal who likes to ape the ladies of the stage in
all their eccentricities. It looks as if the wearer
had a black eye, and was trying to hide it from
the general gaze. Everyone admires the tur-
quoises, because they are fine stones and look
expensive. But the wearing of ropes and festoons
of jewels really does not set them off to advan-
tage, A jewelled ornament is beautiful, a mass
of jewels merely flaunting. A single turquoise,
well set and worn with taste, looks finer than
Nellie Stewart’s strings of them.
“George Musgrove last week held a private
view of the beautiful pantomime dresses he has
bought. He is doing the thing well. Not only
is the material of the richest, but the amount of
hand-painting and embroidery upon them is
astonishing. He gave 80 guineas for the cloak
Nellie Stewart is to wear as the Prince who
marries, Cinderella. It is quite certain that the
Duchess of York, when she comes along, won’t
have any finer clothes than George Musgrove’s
ballet girls.
“ We never saw such a magnificent feather on
Melb. stage as the monster white one Nellie
Stewart wears in her hair when she changes from
boy to girl costume. London must have been
ransacked for the plumage. Ostrich, or what ?
It is a close-set thing that looks more like a wing
of the Divine Swan in ‘Lohengrin.’
“ Mrs. (Dorothy Vane) Menzies had her hair
dressed like an Ophelia out of work at ‘Flora-
dora’ on Saturday night. Blue ribbon loops
and forget-me-nots were looped in and out of her
touzled locks in trellis-frame fashion.
44 Hymen’s torch gives a flicker this week for
the hltching-up of Miss Corrie Browne— 4 Rolf
Boldrewood’s ’ daughter—and rosy-faced little Dr.
Mollison. Miss Browne, like all her sisters, is
tall and dashing. The Doctor was a widower;
his former wife was daughter of the veteran
journalist James Smith. The hitching-up was
fixed for Tuesday (18th), all Toorak helping to
jubilate. By the way, contingents of the gayest
Toorakians are leaving for Sydney in Christmas
week.
“Camphor pills, pink powder, and patent

or inserted in the belt. It is perforated, and pro-
vided in such a fashion with pearl-pink powder
that one only has to pass it ever so lightly over
the hot face to produce a peach-bloom. The sort
of thing Max Beerbohm would commend in his
Gospel of Make-up.
44 Speaker Mason is anxiously waiting for the
programme of entertainments which Mr. Upward
is said to be bringing back, among other important
missives, from Sydney this week. The systematic
Speaker is going to have several hundreds of these
programmes struck off for the convenience of all
the women agitating to know what to pack up for
the junkets.
“A gay little Sydney matron was the most
stared-at figure at the Austral (M.C.C.) meeting
on Saturday. And the M.C.C. crowds can stare.
She was got up in pink and red from the tip of
her scarlet hat to the hem of her coral skirt, and
glanced back at the starers through a pince-nez
on an ebony stick.
“Mrs. Fraser (of St. Kilda shooting fame) is
distinguishing herself of late as an oarswoman on
the perfumed Yarra. She handles the sculls
most deftly, and gives her women friends a treat
every now and then by a long, long pull in the
savory haunt of the suicides.
“The late Mrs. C. Nelson, whose death has
just been cabled from Florence, was the charm-
ing, clever, dainty Nelly Petty—a belle in Mel-
bourne circles some years ago. She married, while
not out of her teens, Hon. Charles Horatio Nel-
son, and they resided in these parts for a year or
two, going about quietly and enjoying themselves
thoroughly. The pair were petite, pretty, and as
much alike as twins. They both had a way of
parting the hair and waving it off the forehead
exactly alike. Mrs. Nelson was other things
besides a dainty Dresden figure ; she was a linguist
and a brilliant musician. Her two sisters (Mrs.
Barrachi and Mrs. Dr. Quick) are well-known in
Melbourne, and are not many shades less fair and
fragile than the winsome deceased, who was on
holiday in Florence with her husband, when she
fell ill and died.
44 The Boer war has resulted in an engagement
between Miss Lorna Price and Mr. Ainslie Mills,
eldest son of the ‘Uardry’ Millses, of Hay
(N.S.W.). This joyful event came of Col. Tom
Price confiding his only daughter to Janet Lady’s
care when he started off for S’Africa on his big fat
gee-gee. He returned to find the engagement
waiting for his martial sanction, and, having duly
said ‘Yes,’ he slapped the young man on the
back with his war-stained sword and said, 4 Arise,
Son-in-law Elect,’ in his best Colonel Tom manner.
At least, that is how one pictures the scene. And
now we are all waiting to know whether somebody
or other (with money) doesn’t intend to capture
the paternal Thomas before the glamor is worn off
him. What a kharki wedding-procession they
might have!
“ ’Twill be a bitter pill for S’Malcolm M ‘Eacharn
to swallow if his buxom wife and co-entertainer is
detained in England by illness throughout the
coming Royal shivoo. ’Tis said that the absentee
shattered her health, for the second time, working
and worrying over that Melbourne Hospital
bazaar. And, after all, the undertaking wasn’t
much of a success—the institution would still
languish in debt only for an after outside effort.
Sassiety as a whole takes no interest in the poor,
old towny Melb. Hospital—which comes hard on
the few Naicest who do give a hand to the non-
fashionable charity. See how the Smartest slaved
recently for the Children’s Hospital, which hardly
treats more juveniles than the Melbourne does, in
addition to the latter’s grown-up patients. No
4 accidents ’ are too horrid for the shabby Lonsdale-
street rookery. Infectious cases, all sorts, find a
corner in the tents or the refractory wards. Some
sister institutions are such dainty decorative show-
places that non-ornamental sufferers feel them-
selves quite out of the picture.
44 The late Silas Harding’s money seems doomed
to bring pleasure to no one. The original owner
himself kept it in so tight a grip that he experi-
enced little joy from its possession. After his
death his widow started to enjoy herself, but a
driving accident cut short her career, and her
brother and sister inherited her thousands. The
heiress married the manager of one of the Harding
stations, and is mostly out of town. Her co-
legatee sometimes puts in a dreary week at the
late Mrs. Harding’s Toorak mansion, which is
usually shut up and left to servants. Mrs.
Harding bought ‘ The Towers,’ as it is called, for
a song from Matthew Davies in the bad times,
and atoned for the smallness of its price by the
magnificence of its furnishings, which have
scarcely seen the light since her death.
“The fashion of women wearing portrait-
medallions of their last-born has spread like the
craze of coon-songs, and many of the younger
untried Benedicts are now sporting miniature
photos, of the wife of their bosom as watch -chain
pendants. This kind of 4 On our Selection ’ advt.
has mainly been confined to the good and guile-
less (from Lady Madden downwards), but lately
one sees a flighty Flossie sporting a huge framed
photo, of a boarded-out baby—which rather dese-
crates the sentiment in the eyes of the orthodox.
It is wicked for Flossie to entertain motherly
feelings towards her little indiscretion.
“ Talking of coon-songs ! At the Naice family
reunions occurring variously in the drawing-rooms
of the Maddens, Binghams, and Stephens, these
pickaninny 4 Won’t-yer-love-yer-honey ’ strains
are all the vogue. The Madden gem has a small,
sweet voice which goes rather well with lullabies,
and the new nigger reiterations of the 4 Sue, Sue
I love you, so I do ’ order.
“Through the death of the Earl of Darnley,
the Hon. Ivo Bligh—the younger brother—
succeeds to the title. Cricketer Ivo married
about ten years ago, Miss Florence Morphy, of
an old English family at Beech worth (Vic.).
Another of the lovely Morphy girls married that
brilliant linguist and voracious reader, Mr. L. S.
Daniels, one time corresponding clerk in the
G.P.O.
“Mr. Gurr, the new Postmaster-General,
started his official duties by visiting every de-
partment of the P.O. where the shriller sex are
employed. He was formally introduced to them
all by the accountant, and had a few words to
exchange over each hand-shake. The excitement
of the chiffon clerks may be imagined. The whole
feminine portion of the G.P.O. got itself into a
state of blushing and giggling delight. P.M.’s-
General are not m the habit of being as sweet as
Eie to the Mauds and Ethels, and this act of the
on. member (he is a Geelong auctioneer) was re-
garded as a most promising sign. Deputy P.M.G.
Outtrim—a faint copy of the Waxellency in oils —
is supposed to be another gallant officer, though a
hard taskmaster.
“ Melbourne johnniedom is sad at heart because
of the barbarity of local tailors, who are combining
for mutual protection against the masher who
dresses ‘on the nod.’ A gorgeously-apparelled
swell, who lately went through the local court
after going through the local tailors, owed money
to 15 different Snips, and one or two of his little
bills totted up to £2O apiece. Solomon in all
his glory was not garbed like the average Mel-
bourne Johnnie, and, with all his wisdom, Sol. did
not contrive to do it as cheaply. The tailors, in
meeting assembled, have resolved to compile a
black-list for the protection of the Trade. Which
is doosid shabby, by Jove! Just as the Duke’s
coming, too!
“Don’t the men cluster round that Elizabeth -
street window, arranged, I’m told, by a Yankee,
who charges so much per week ! The gem of the
display is a lovely wax creature in decorative
decollete under-wear. She rolls her brown eyes,
flashes her ivories, and heaves her undraped
upper chest till her pearl necklets tinkle again.
All this animation gives her an air of joyous,
almost frenzied, expectation anent the contents

on the mysterious packet the name of a brand of
corsets. What a fuss over a pair of stays 1
Another window frames a scene called ‘The
Hero’s Return.’- Hubby, in kharki, clasps in his
arms his sweet young wife, while their child,
squatted on the carpet, forms the word 4 father ’
in letter-blocks. The returned brave must at one
time have been given up for lost, for his sweet
one wears black. Weeks had gone on, however,
and—aye, here’s the rub—the mourner had re-
lieved her outward gloom by white yoke and
fixings—those sartorial symptoms of a healing
heart! She was just beginning to ‘take notice’
again.
“ Some people have broad ideas as to how easy
it is to buy Australian public officials. T’other
day a trustee of a certain National Gallery re-
ceived a letter, the sender of which said he had an
Australian picture for sale. ‘I want £l6O for it,’
he wrote. 4 lf anyone could undertake the task
of booming and selling an unknown artist’s work,
I do not think £6O too much for the trouble.’
Delicately put, and the proposed commission is
quite handsome.
44 A Melb. maiden lady of considerable wealth,
who lately had the misfortune to lose her pet
Toby, has gone into full mourning for the defunct
quadruped. He was interred in a polished coffin
with dainty trimmings, and has a neat little head-
stone to keep him down. She tearfully explained
to a friend : 4 1 put roses on his cheeks, and roses
on his breast; and if there is a heaven I know I
shall meet him there.’ The sordid part of the
transaction is that the pampered tyke was chawed
to death by a three-cornered mongrel belonging
to a livery-stable man.
“ A prominent Melb. medico is apparently
striving to emulate Shah Jehan by building a sort
of Taj-Mahal over the remains of his deceased
wife. The thing will run into a ton of money by
the time it is completed. Sculptor Bertram Mac-
kennal’s visit to Australia appears to be not un-
connected with the raising of this inuch-talked-of
monument, the inauguration of which is expected
to be a memorable function.
“The Xmas issue of the Melb. Musical Maga-
zine is to hand from Allan and Co. The M.M.M.
this year contains 11 songs of a violently popular
order, ranging from Bert Gilbert’s ‘My Birthday’
to 4 Barney Hooligan ’ and ‘Biscuits in Bed,’ and
all this joy can be purchased for one shilling. It
goes as a matter of course that photoes of the
York pair adorn the wrapper.
44 Was there ever such a year as this for roses?
Red ones, at all events, were never more richly
perfumed. Those blooming round the lawns at
Flemington, during recent race-meetings, were
too sweet to be safe from even the Naicest, with
lovely gardens of their own at home. Sweet
scents have a fierce fascination for women. A
girl of scribe’s acquaintance says she feels deeply
religious when she sniffs a red rose, just as if she
could worship the balmy blossom. Pope was
on another tack when he wrote :
Die of a rose in aromatic pain.
But the line describes the sensations of fragrance-
worshippers. Another enthusiast testifies that if
a champagne were manufactured, tasting exactly
like the scent of roses, she would take to drink,
adding that if tipplers feel like that about whisky,
she can make allowances for them. But that’s the
trouble. You can never get anything to taste as
well as it smells.

Duncan Gillies says he doesn’t mean to

pose of writing to his noble relative.
Some of the members of late Vic. Minis-

turned back.
It will be intimated to Premier Seddon
that if he speaks at all at the Commonwealth cele-
brations he must confine himself to a quarter of
an hour at most. There is a well-grounded fear
that Seddon might repeat his brain-tiring Jubilee
performance.
“ Banjo ” Paterson, lecturing in Scottish
Dunedin, trod heavily on the corns of the haggis-

Tommies did the work “ as a Scotchman navigates

laugh; they looked sorry for him.
Rev. Dr. Marshall, of Melbourne, claims
democracy as the offspring of Presbyterianism.
Didn t Marcus Clarke predict that Victoria’s na-

Pat Murphy, the bushinan who conducted

That frisky Benedict-elect, Mr. Justice
Stephen, now 72 and a topic of great gossiping
interest, has completed the half-century since he
was called to the Bar. He was called three years
before the Chief Justice of his Court. He became
Associate to his father, the late N.S. Wales C.J.,
at seventeen years of age, and may thus be said to
have worn legal harness for fifty-five years.
A. Catt, Chairman of Committees of the
S. A Assembly, was 67 on Wednesday (Dec. 19).
He has sat in the House for 19 years and has re-
presented Gladstone ever since it was an electoral
district. Also be has been often a Minister of the
Crown, in the Wesleyan interest. J. H. Car-
ruthers was 43 on Dec. 21; Judge Casey (Vic.)
will be 69 on Christmas Day ; and President Hugh
Aelson (Q.) will be 65 on the last day of the
century.
About the most startling thing in Marie
Corelli’s latost shriek is a statement made by a
good character to a large audience that “he had
seen the consummation of many ungodly mar-
riages.” This mistake, by the way, was once
made with great effect by a lady writer in a
Sydney daily paper. In describing an alfresco
wedding, she stated that “ the marriage was con-
summated under a stately tree.”
That missing Geelong solicitor, the pious
Grey, whom the Viet. Government was apparently
so anxious not to capture, was again mentioned
the other day. It was a matter of a small casual
swindle of nearly £15,000. Grey’s total swindles
have been vaguely mentioned as between £lOO,OOO
and £250,000, and this stupendous and well-
connected fraud has apparently never been seri-
ously inquired after.
Kingston says it brings tears to his eyes
whenever he thinks of the generous remarks S.A.
Tories make about his splendid qualities as a
Federal statesman, and he is touched to the heart
at their unanimous desire to see him promoted.
Most of these men have been busy calling him a
brutal autocrat, a political robber, a selfish despot,
&c., &c., for six years past, and consequently
Kingston says he really wonders whether Fat-
man’s effusive Federal goodwill comes of a desire
to get rid of him.
The pioneers of Melbourne were not

Said Li Hung Chang the other day
to a fellow-countryman : “Keep quiet, sit
tight, do nothing, the foreign devils will
fight among themselves.” “ Sit tight” re-
marks a Sydney daily, “ does not seem an
diomatic Chinese phrase, but perhaps the
translation is free.” “Sit tight” has for
many years been a favorite phrase of Li
Hung’s closest white pal, Pritchard Morgan,

In turns out that the unknown “ Henry
Wait,” £lOOO slabs from whose extensive estate
have of late been received by various Sydney
charities, made his money as a butcher in old
Sydney. He died a bachelor aged 85, and was a
careful frugal little man who had long retired
from the meat-business and taken to lending
money on freehold security. He was probably a
native of England, but never talked about his
early -days. Also, since visiting California in the
roaring days he had such a horror of sea-travel that
he never even journeyed as far as North Shore
or Manly Beach.
SUCH IS LIFE!—AT THE PANTOMIME.
FIRST MASK: “Tom, how’s your poor little sick
daughter? ”
SECOND MASK : “My dear boy, I tremble every
moment lest news of her death should come.”
The sedate ox-merchant Brunker charac-
teristically punctured the loan debate in N.S.W.
Leg. Assembly at the close of the session with the
accusing assurance that the Lyne Govt. had
“paid £6O for a ten-months’-old-calf ” and put it
down to loan-account. When Parkes broke his
leg by a fall from a cab, and was ordered to lie
up for a term and live on milk and farina, the
placid Brunker rose similarly to the dignity of
his profession and closed a note of sympathy with
—“ I’ll send you a cow.”
N.S. W. Postmaster-General Crick is being
tongue-whipped into attendance at Govt. House.
Throughout the Beauchamp regime he refused to
pay a courtesy visit to that establishment, and
was, as a consequence, omitted from the list of
guests to be invited. “But surely you are not
going to perpetuate that foolishness when Hope-
toun comes! ” is the nagging remonstrance.
Parkes, in his vigorous days, refused to visit
Govt. House save on official business. Until a
couple of years before his death his name never
appeared in the visitors’ book.
Australian Horse Trooper Palmer, lately
returned from S’Africa, exhibited the other night
to a welcoming company at Bombala, N.S.W.,
the bullet which, after lodging in his brain at the
battle of Poplar Grove—had remained therein for
six months, before being extracted by Victor
Horsley, the great London surgeon. Palmer also
showed an X-ray photo, of his brain with the
bullet in it. It’s a truly remarkable scientific
development that enables a man to behold the
contents of his own noddle.
Two loyal Sydney pressmen have signed
an agreement under which they will compile an
account of the sayings and doings in Australia of
the Royal Yorks and share equally in the mone-
tary results.
Ancient Townsend M‘Dermott, the sharp-
tongued father of the Victorian Bar, testimonialised
at Ballarat lately, could always give the masterful
Purves a nasty jar in the days when they were ex-
changing compliments in Melb. courts. On one
occasion Mac introduced the name of Purves’
father into a wrangle and the younger man pro-
tested angrily. Whereupon M‘Dermott said that
no insult was intended for he had in fact a con-
siderable respect for Purves’ father, for whom he
had done more than he would ever think of doing
for his father’s son. “ What did you do for my
father ?” yelled Purves. “I introduced him into
respectable society,” was the sweet reply.
The final tinkering at the names of the
N.S.W. Federal electorates has pretty well elimi-
nated all the original suggestions of the Commis-
sioners. The Legislature has commemorated the
names of Lang, Dailey, Bland, Cowper and Went-
worth, by bestowing their names on Parliamentary
divisions, but, curiously enough, has forgotten all
about Parkes. The omission could not have been
because of the fact that “Parkes” is already
appropriated for a State electorate, as Lang
and Wentworth, to say nothing of Illawarra
Parramatta and Richmond, have also been so
appropriated. Which fact will be certain to cause
confusion later on, as Richmond and Wentworth
Federal electorates are miles away from the well-
known townships of the same names.
Melbourne’s new mayor, Sam. Gillott,
showed such aptitude for law when he was office-
boy to solicitor O’Brien that his master made him
a gift of his articles. As far back as the middle
sixties smart boy Sam. was admitted, and soon
reached front rank as police-court lawyer, though
he had such tough opponents as Frank Stephen,
Jack Edwards, jun., Albert Read, G. P. Smith
Gaunson.Sam Lyons and M'Kean. For the last
few years his position as a special pleader in the
lower courts has been a case of “ Eclipse first, the
rest nowhere.” On the few occasions when the
leader of the bar and Gillott have “crossed swords”
before beak Panton, the attorney has had none the
worst of it, though he seems rather lacking in
sense of humor.
B. C. A spinal], the renowned
old-time Q.C., was a very careless
Bohemian. The Duke of Edin-
burgh, who visited Victoria in ’6B,
struck up a great friendship with
him, and, having been entertained
on board the Galatea, Aspinall felt
obliged to ask H.R.H. to lunch at
his house. When in the city at 2
a.m., some hours after giving the
invitation for next day, it suddenly
dawned upon him that he had no
provision for the entertainment.
He accordingly knocked up a
friendly hotelkeeper, who may ba j
called Johnson, and asked if he
would assist him. Johnson realised
the seriousness of the position,
roused his servants out early, had
an elegant luncheon prepared, and
drove with it to the barrister’s
house at 9 a.m. Mrs. Aspinall was
terrified when she heard that the
luke was to lunch with her at 1
o’clock that day. Said the dis-
mayed little lady: “ There is abso-
lutely nothing in the house. The
baker has refused to call for a week
past because his account is not
paid ; and there is not a complete
cruet on the premises, nor four
knives and forks of the same
pattern.” Johnson drove back to
his hotel and supplied everything
needful. The luncheon went off
splendidly, but it was Johnson who
entertained the duke, not Aspinall.
Premier Turner was articled to “Jack”
Edwards, jun., a great police-court and theatrical
Melb. solicitor of bj 7 gone days. Jack had a won-
derful fund of theatrical anecdote, and was an
accomplished Shakesperian scholar and delightful
raconteur. He was a lifelong friend of Dr. J. E.
Neild, and the friendship was cemented not long
;i g° by the marriage of Tom Edwards, a son of
Jack’s, to a daughter of the old doctor’s. Tom
follows his father’s profession with marked ability,
and his work oti police-court procedure is a recog-
nised text-book.
J. F. Hogan, Irish Nationalist mem-
ber for Mid-Tipperary, now visiting Australia,
when a member of Melb. Akgus reporting staff
in the eighties had much to do with the exposing
of an absurd Russian scare got up by the Age,
which said that the commander of a Muscovite
war-ship in Port Phillip Bay spent all his spare
time in surveying the harbor with instruments on
shore. Hogan alleged that the officer was only
amusing himself by rabbit-shooting, and that the
Agk Paul Pry had mistaken his gun for a theodo-
lite. Somebody afterwards explained that Rus-
sians always shot rabbits with theodolites.
In Melbourne, the Age has been looking
kindly on the irrepressible J. P. T. Caulfield and
his drink-cure And now a local paper, in seeking
to explain how Caulfield has “ conquered ” David
Syme, prints this :—
The only explanation there can be is that he brought to
bear on Mr Syme that marvellous mental influence which
he exercises with such telling effect on his patients.
Because it is our opinion that Mr. Caulfield’s success is
attributable not only to the drugs which he doses his
patients with, but also to the possession by him of some
extraordinary magnetic or hypnotic faculty. And it is
not difficult to see that a psycho-therapeutist who can
use his powers on a strong-willed, careful, cautious
Scotchman like David Syme can do so with ease on his
weaker alcoholic brethren.
How David-Syme will relish the idea that he has
been mesmerised by a mere man-with-a-jaw—and
cheek to match !
Plucky parson Rentoul sticks to his guns
despite “ Keristian ’’-respectability Jingoism and
all the accepted elements of “Fat.” His
“Christmas Hymn” gets printed by the “repu-
table ” organs as a sort of literary shocking
example. A specimen verse re the Church :
A friend of mine who was furniture-broking- here (Perth)
a few j'ears ago received orders from the “Major” to
have made forthwith several suites of furniture, as he
expected his wife and family from t’otherside, and in-
tended setting up housekeeping. When the furniture
was finished the “Major” was duly advised, and soon
after came rushing, in to my friend’s office to say that his
wife had misconstrued his instructions and g : one on to
Coolgardie with the family. The broker was asked to
keep the furniture in hand until the “ Major” could get
his wife and family back. Nothing more was heard from
him for some time. Then the broker called at the Govt
offices to interview his client, and was astounded to be
told that Mrs. Pelly and family had all died together
presumably at Coolgardie, from typhoid. My friend’
however, had his doubts, and showed them. Whereupon
the “ Major ’ told him that the whole affair was a huge
joke, and that he should be very careful, as he was playing
with a dangerous man! The broker then thought that
perhaps it would be better to let the matter drop as he
found, meanwhile, that Pelly had been really expecting
some lady friend over to keep house for him, and had been
disappointed. I used to see the old chap pass my lodgings
to and fro for years, and he was usually mumbling to
himself in a half-daft way as he went.

N.S.W. Pastoral Lands Commission, after
taking evidence in Melbourne at Cup-time,
doubled back to Sydney instead of proceeding to
fulfil its engagements in the Far West ; and so it
missed Wentworth, Menindie, Broken
Hill, and the other centres where drought condi-
tions have been worst. In Melb. it had as wit-
nesses squatters and representatives of mortgage
co.’s holding squattages—men whose main remedy
for the pastoral hard-times is to shut selector
out more securely and for more years. The Far
West selectors’ answer to that plea, let alone their
case in support of the more liberal treatment of
their class at the squatters’ expense, has not been
heard ; • moreover, as the selector doesn’t take a
house at Manly or in the Mountains for the sum-
mer, and as he hasn’t the means to get half round
the continent, his views will not be heard unless
the Commission goes into the selectors’ country.
Yet if it does not hear that side—having heard the
squatters’ side—the Commission will be discredited,
and any report which it may present will be
simply sniffed at.

“ Spinifex ” : Re freaks in marsupials.
In Queensland I once shot a young “buck ” kan-
garoo, with left arm and shoulder missing—-had
evidently never existed, as there was no sign of
an injury, even when the skin was removed. I
also once shot a white kangaroo which was not an
albino, the eyes being brown, and the paws and
muzzle black.
THE LATE HENRY PARKES.—From Tom Roberts’ painting,
exhibited at the Royal Academy.
Dr. Roth reports that he lately exhumed
a skull of a member of the Kalkadoon
tribe (Cloncurry way). The skull was diffi-
cult to obtain and the Kalkadoon who
assisted at the exhumation admitted
that he had partaken of the arms
and legs of deceased. (Forearms
and lower limbs were missing.)
The Kalkadoons (says Dr. Roth)
practise a curious form of mutila-
tion : the females at an early age
are deprived of a part of one of
the little lingers. Dr. Roth’s
report of the condition of the
aboriginals is a sad tale of the
ravages wrought by grog, opium,
and disease.

“Via”: If “ MacC.” (B.,
13/10/’00) wants ivorms let him

once, but cut an old ’un open one day and found
it practically alive, even in the backbone.
The wily horse-dealer has lately been
having a good time in Melb. :
Evidence in court showed that one particular horse
had been “ shoved off no fewer than 20 times during the
last 12 months.” A draught horse was sold for £22, with
a warranty, a deposit of £lO being paid, and the animal
turned out to be a “close roarer.” A vet. gave evidence
that the stertorous breathing was concealed for a tune
by the use of grease and shot. The “ roaring is caused
by a kind of flap. The practice of the horse-coper is to
drop shot down the throat to settle the flap, with a quan-
tity of grease, which also lubricates the glands, me
animal in question was not worth 10s., unless the lead
inside him would “pan out” to that value. In the
second case a widow bought a pony for £6 10s., and paid
£4 deposit. It was guaranteed to be staunch, quiet, and
fond of children. Its first action on arriving at its new
home was to chase a little girl round the yard, then it
chewed up the clothes on the line, and smashed things
generally. When put in a cart it kicked the vehicle to
pieces, and was a rank jib, though the dealer said it
would go well when it got warm. Verdicts were given
against the swindlers on each instance.

A valued correspondent to The Bulletin :
The report of the Northern (Q.) Protector of Aborigines
contains some interesting reading. Boiled down it
amounts to a grave indictment against the Northern re-
cruiting system ; against the method of lengthy agree-
ments in labor matters ; and against the Northern shoddy
blanket given as a solatium to the nigger who has been
robbed of his best hunting grounds. John Douglas (it
appears) tried to prevent the evils of unlimited recruit-
by making the written consent of a missionary a pre-
liminary to labour contracts, but the boats contrived to
evade this, and often “ the blacks were not returned at
all.” (Pause and think !) Moreover, the old blacks have
a cheerful custom of selling the young fellows for a little
flour and tobacco, and the inspector is of opinion that the
young men die early owing to the hardships experienced
on the boats. The low birth-rate is also attributed to the
abuses of the labor traffic. One is glad to find that pro-
vision has been made for feeding numbers of the blacks
in seasons of trouble and scarcity, and the dole of a
monthly bullock in the wet season must be keenly appre-
ciated.' As illustrating the injurious effects of certain
civilised gifts, the Protector remarks that the distribu-
tion of blankets “ has tended to the utter desuetude of
the native-made opossum and bark-cloth rugs.’ It might
also be added that the shoddy blanket is the cradle of
phthisis ; that the old ’possum rug was worth halr-a-
dozen blankets : and that the State that sums up its duty
to the aboriginal in the gift of a shoddy blanket is a
pretty mean State. Vale Warrigal 1

“ W.Gr.H.” : Re par (B. 6/10/’00) about
25 head of cattle that perished on a particular
station, when travelling, and your remark that
that drover would have had a gaudy time burning
them had the squatter enforced the law. Out of
a mob oi JoO 1 ravelling from Mooney Plains to
Bourke, 3Ju perished on Boorara run from heat
and thirst. What kind of a job would that drover

“ H.J.” : Can any-
oi o tell me how it is
that if a dam be sunk
away on the plains, say
40 miles from any fish-
inhabited creek or river,
inside 12 months the
said dam will be swarm-
ing with small fishes?
The theory that water-
fowl bring the fish-
spawn to such dams is
untenable, because, if
the dam or tank be
boarded over, and the
water drawn therefrom
per pump, the fish get
there precisely thesame.
The only tenable theory
seems to be that the
germs of these small
fishes float about as
atoms in the air—as is
proved to be the case
in the Infusoria ., c.g.,
Rotifer vulgaris, and
the Vibriotritici —and
become vitalised or re-
vivified on being de-
posited in a medium
favorable to their de-
velopment. Cray-fish,
in like manner, soon
swarm in dams or
covered ground tanks.

“H.F.”: I live
near a N.S.W. coastal
creek where black
cockatoos nest. We
never see them on the
high land unless rain is
coming. Then, as early
as 60 hours before the
storm, they fly in small
screeching flocks low
down over the ridges.
Never knew the fore-
cast to fail, and in point
of time they beat
Wragge and Russell
badly. Has the black
cockatoo as a weather-
prophet been previously
noted?

“Lar”: Be “ the alleged evil effects of
opium-smoking w :
I once struck a Ohow, dead beat, starving and famish-
ing for his customary opium-smoke, and as I wanted a
cook for the homestead I put him on. Turned out one or
the best cooks and pastrymakers I ever met, but he was
a glutton for opium. Used to smoke it, eat pellets of it,
and make a sort of opium-tea as well; yet after a bit he
got as fat and jolly as a sandboy. Always ran ‘up to
the bit,” got through his work to the tick, and
his sleep always came up smiling and fresh. Also, I have
known niggers work for a week, earn a shilling, and start
off gaily on a 20-mile walk to nearest township, get an
opium smoke, and walk hack quite pleased with them-
selves.
And yet, Heaven help the avemne white man
who contracts the opium-habit. This scribe has
known dozens of opium-consumers, and out of
them all there was but one who ever even said
that he never had to increase, but was satisfied
with his regular daily dose of a certain small
quantity.
“ D.B. : Surveying once
on New England ranges, the
boss was a terror for early
rising. Used to watch for
the first indications of
dawn to call up all hands
and the cook—especially
the cook. One frosty
morning he awoke the
latter with — “Joe, I
think I see the morning
star.” “All right, sir,”
replied Joe, as he drew
his blankets tighter,
“keep yer eye on it
till I get a stick.”
But he got the “sack”
instead.

“Yarrum”: Once
shared with a parson
at an Auckland hotel
a room at the top of
the house, and before
turning in his rever-
ence opened his car-
pet bag and drew forth
about 50yds of |in. rope,
knotted at intervals of about
afoot. Thought he was going
to hang himself, or me, but he just tied
one end to the bed-post, and hung the
other out of the window, “ Should there be a
fire, my friend,” said he, “just you go down by
that rope, and I’ll be after you.” Assured me
he had been the means of saving many lives m his
time ; also, that he had once lost a valuable watch
that a room-mate took a fancy to, departing per
rope with the “ joolery.” A week after, strange
to say, that pub. was burnt right out.

Dr. Roth complains bitterly of the treat-
ment of young aboriginal and half-caste girls in
the north. Criminal assaults on young girls of 15
and 16 years of age are only too common, and very
seldom is it possible to punish the offenders. It
is however, consolation to know that at Deebing
Creek (S.Q,) the aboriginal kiddies (visited, the
other day by Queensland notables) gave quite a
creditable display of skill in vulgar fractions and
decimals. The world is full of compensations.

“Silly Billy”: Be Willie, chief of Q.
trackers (8., 24/11/’00). As far as I could see
(and I saw aH the trackers at work), the Queens-
landers had nothing to “blow” about. While
the blood-trail was fairly plain they could track,
but when they missed the blood marks and on
absolutely the best ground to track a man, they
lost all traces. As for Willie’s alleged contempt
for his N.S.W. brethren, there were two or three
of these quite as good as the Queenslanders ; and
in any case the best tracking of the lot was done
by a white man —Billy Bartlett, of near Dungog
—who tracked Joe Governor right down the
Jackey Bulga to Dingo Creek, where Jimmy was
captured.

From the North-west: —
during the last six weeks no less than nine men are
known to have perished in the great lone W est—for want
of water in holes never known to he dry before. Last
month two bicycles were found, with swags strapped to
them, leaning against a boundary fence—the rulers God
alone knows where. The tyres were badly punctured and
the rubber in shreds from riding over the rough countiy.
Th v belonged to two brothers named Hollingsworth,
who were travelling either to or'from Kapunda, the
machines being found 10 miles from that place. One
body has been recovered, and the police are still search-
irvdfor the other. The tracks of another unfortunate,
missed from Lucknow station, in Winton district, were
followed for 6 mil-s, and then only abandon; d owing to
their running into stony and hilly country, where it was
-known there was no water nearer than '2O miles.

from Clermont to Ravenswood m hundreds, and
the stations are having an awful time. One cattle-
man told me 54 called for rations m one week, and
11 m one day. In N.Q. the work is given to
blacks, Japs., Chows, and kanakas, and the white
has to tramp hundreds of miles without a chance
of getting any—existing on salt-junk and a panni-
kin of dust.

THE MAN FROM MUNGINDI.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ke strolled into a public bar and loudly called lor beer ;
He downed it with a gurgling sigh and scratched his off-
side ear ;
“ I’m from the country, boys,” he said, “ and snakes, but
ain’t I dry !
We’re reg’lar vvhales at sinking beer —us coves from Mun-
gindi.”,
Two loafers sat within that bar, their tongues were hang-
ing out—
Impatiently they waited for that bushie man to shout ;
They watched each beer fast disappear and muttered
with a sigh :
“ We might a known he’d go alone, this man from llun-
gindi.”
When fifteen beers had gone the way that beers were
meant to go,
The bushie man, as busbies will, began to skite and blow
“ I know you Sydney coves,” he said , “ You think you re
mighty fly,
But we can show you lots of tricks way up in Mungindi.
“ Now you two blokes a-sitting there, perhaps you’d like
a drink ? ”
“You bet we would,” they both replied, as quick as you
could wink.
“ Oh, right you are, then help yourselves ; the water-
bottle’s nigh.
Ha 1 Ha 1 I cotched ye there,” he roared, “ that’s one for
Mungindi 1 ”
Now when a big man jests ’tisbest your anger you should
cloak —
And so they laughed a troubled laugh, as at a clever joke.
“ Not bad,” they said ; “ but we’ve a trick that’s called
1 Now, mind your eye 1 ’
And as it’s new we’ll show it you to take to Mungindi.
“ Well, first we want your hankychef to bandage both
your eyes;
That’s right—now stand quite still a bit, you’ll get a nice
surprise.”
Then, hauling off, right in his face they suddenly let fly
Two fearful biffs, and bolting, yelled: “ There’s two for
Mungindi! ”

... The Most Popular, because it is Unequalled in Quality
Order
SCHWEPPE’S aerated
SARSAPARILLA
The Westralian Government has unai
countably been moved to inquire into the condition
ef Fremantle Lunatic Asylum, a strange,
antiquated, dirt-encrusted, hat-box structure of
the olden time, with which Westralia was com-
paratively satisfied until it became unsettled in its
nnnd by the influx of new ideas from the East.
This is h®w the mild and even-tempered West
Australian sums up the results of the inquiry :
The asylum is, almost without exception, everything
that it should not be. The dormitories on the male side
contain an insufficient allowance of air-space, arid are
“ extremely malodorous and badly arranged for ventila-
tion.” The floors are not as clean as they should be. The
cracks between the boards are described as being “full
of dirt.” Many of the skirting-boards in the old building
are loose, and harbour multitudes of peculiarly obnoxious
vermin. Tidiness seems more often than not an ab-
sent virtue. References are abundant to broken furni-
ture, old boots, bundles of rags, old tins, sacking,
iron- ware, scraps of food in the bedrooms and
other places where they should not be. In one in-
stance the bedsteads are described as being
encrusted with filth. The arrangements for
meals are no less discreditable. It does not seem that
even the harmless patients are allowed the use of knives
and forks. Nor is their meat cut up for them. They
have to tear it asunder with their fingers. The seclusion
or solitary cells “in position, ventilation, and lighting,
are as bad as they can he.” The windows are fitted with
) ‘ unprotected bars, which have already been made the
instruments for suicide.” The male side kitchen displays
“a lamentable lack of appliances.” The laundry is
of the most primitive description, with no utensils
save tubs and tables. Of 17 male attendants,
only one has had any previous asylum experi-
ence. On the female side, consisting, as it does,
for the most part of later additions to the building, the
state of a "airs is somewhat better. Many of the wards
are bright and pleasant, and “ a nicer sense oi order and
refinement ”is evident. But the laundry is out of repair,
and under its floor “ soapsuds are stagnant, putrefied, and
stinking." The laundry is also the bauhroom, and the
baths, in addition to their usual purpose, are employed as
rinsing tubs. The laundry and bathing arrangements
generally on the women’s side are described as being “ an
outrage not only on every principle of asylum manage-
ment, but on common decency and economy.”
The reasons for printing this item under the
heading of “ Aboriginalities ” is obvious enough.
The only way Westralia’s lunacy arrangements
could be made more aboriginal would be by con-
fining the patients separately in hollow trees, and
handing in raw possum and caterpillars to them
at dinner-time.

“W.M.8.” to The Bulletin on ticks in
the Far North :
Recently “trekked” from Oooktown to Townsville
(about 500 miles) through the Bloomfield, Daintree, Moss-
man, Herberton, &c., country all swarming with ticks,
and it’s only a matter of time for the pest to reach the
Richmond and Clarence districts of N.S.W., when—good-
bye to tjjie dairying industry ! The loss of cattle has been
enormous. A man on the Bloomfield lost 4001 out of
6000 in three years, and another in the Cardwell district
10,000 in about the same time. The average loss is about
85 per cent., and the Cardwell and other meat-works are
closed, owing to the high price and scarcity of stock,
throwing hundreds of men out of work. Stock won’t
breed and new stock introduced soon succumb to the
fever. Pitiful to see the wretched beasts, worn-down by
the pests, rubbing themselves against posts, and covered
with blood. On the Bloomfield is a man who started
horse-breeding, 15 years ago, with an entire and three
mares, and now has but two entires and one mare. The
foals nearly all died, and he never sold a beast the whole
time. My own horse on arriving in Townsville was
covered with ticks, and if you sit on the ground for any

country recovers (if it ever does). Drought in the west,
ticks in the north and east, rabbits, dingoes, marsupials
and prickly-pear in the south.

It costs the traveller 7s. 6d. per head per
night now to stable his horses at the pubs, in the
drought-cursed Mt. Browne district, Far-West
N.S.W. All through the west, fromßourketo
the S.A. border, the Works Department has given
travelling teamsters and stockmen free use of the
public watering places for a month—partly to
ease the demand on the private supplies (and
therefore to help save the flocks depending on
them) and partly to let teamsters reach townships
and homesteads threatened with a shortage of
supplies. All hope now is centred on what are
called “the January rains”; and as good rains
fall in January about once in seven years, it is a
grim outlook indeed.
SOCIETY IN THE BACKBLOCKS.

“ Wotto ” : How’s this for an out-back
thirst ? Got up a barrel of whisky for station use,
and placed it m the cellar. The household store,
just above oellar, contained an oil-drum of kero-
sene, which sprang a leak and dripped through
the floor into the barrel of whisky below. Was
going to throw the stuff out, when two |dog-
poisoners on the run said they’d mop it up all
right; so I gave it to them, and they just did
have a jamboree. Saw the sea-serpent twice a
day on the average, and fought every man on“the

known in the Yic. Wimmera—which
grows thick and high, with strong
stems, has been effectively dealt with in
cultivation-paddocks by cutting the crop
with a reaper just prior to the opening
of the bud, and burning it in summer ;
after which a course of cultivation is
needed to disturb the more stubborn
remains.

“ G.J.M.” : Re iguana’s life-

and proceeded to skin him, but immedi-

started to twitch and the heart to throb.
Feeling too much like a vivisection i t, I
immediately cut the neck completely
through. This quietened the limb} and
tail, but the heart only quickened its pul-
sations, so I cut it out altogether and
tossed it aside, and my astonishment may
not be imagined when I saw it hopping
about like a chestnut on a hot shovel.
From where I was a slight declivity ran
about 50yds. to a creek, and down this
the heart bounded like a diminutive foot-
ball, and, falling into the water, was in-
stantly gobbled by a blackfish.

Sydney is to be congratulated on her luck

the city at the reception of the guests of the new-

Q.E.D. : Starting from the Scotch James I. and his Dan-
ish wife you are quite right in working it out that the
Duke of York is 513 parts Scandinavian, 510 parts Ger-
man, and 1 part Scotch. Only Janies I. was partly
French, so the Duke of York is even less British than
your estimate W. Brenta : The difference between us
seems to be that you want to supply the spread-eaglism
and lofty flapdoodle or doodlettap of Liberty, and The
Bulletin wants to pee away at the sober details of work-
ing out a political system under which there will be
Liberty. For instance, this paper wants to wipe out the
big landlord, who is the worst foe of practical liberty, by
graduated land-tax, absentee-tax, and State land banks ;
and the foreign creditor, who is the second-worst foe, by
shutting down on foreign borrowing. And you want to
howl aboutNeroand Caligula and other defunct Romans...

you see, haven’t as much self-restraint as the Jews, nor
are they as quick at mental arithmetic. Nor are they
divested of monetary illusions by being suckled on the
compound-interest table. Jewish Heeald might print

J. O’B. : Dr. Bland, though little known to the present
generation, was just as downright a characW as Went-
worth, Robertson or Lang. He joined the na, yon gain-
ing his diploma, but on the first trip shot the purser in a
duel and arranged a second duel with another officer, for
which offences he was sentenced to seven years at Botany
Bay. Bland libelled Gov. Macquarie and was sentenced
to pay £5O and do 12 months in Parramatta gaol. Then
he was elected to the old Leg. Council, where he stayed
till Bob Lowe squeezed him out... .Castlemaine : The
culprit wasn’t such a fool as he looked. A 2-year sentence
is reduced by remission to 18 months ; one of 1J years—
under the iilogical Vic. system—merely to 16 months ;
while the long term carries with it the right to tea and
tobacco, which the short one does not. Also a confinee
for two years or over can earn a gratuity on discharge ;
the other man is thrown out penniless. . .P.R. (Kerang) :
If Max Hirsch denied that N.S.W. has spent £10,000,000
(the figures are now up to £11,000,000) of loan funds for

tician Coghlan isn’t telling the truth. The figures appear
in Ooghlan’s annual “ Statistics of the Seven Colonies.”

A.L.P. : If N.S.W. alleged Labor-leader M'tiowen really
believes that “ Sunday picnics and the Sunday opening
of refreshment-shops are steps in the direction of the
continental Sunday,” which he so abhors (though he
evidently knows nothing about it), why doesn’t he submit
a Bill to abolish Sunday picnics ? Mr. M’Gowen’s side-
argument that the retail fruit-trade is in the hands of
Dagoes, is beneath contempt. The Dago beats the
Englishman in the fruit-business because, for one reason,
he is usually industrious enough to breathe on his apples
and then polish them on his velveteen trousers. The
Englishman is too darned lazy to do this... .Alice E. :

likes to carry notes or gold because they are light, and

which women will adopt only when all others fail.

The Rev. J B Meharry, the

last month after his stay of
about eight months in Sydney,
has been giving some of his
Australian impressions “Tn

rampant, intemperance moves on
a gigantic scale, vice has tre-

ance of pride.” Mr. Meharry added
that he had been naturally gratified
at the blessing which attended his own
ministry. “ The Woollahra congregation
gradually increased, until it was impos-
sible to accommodate all who came.”

Science of the Age.
The modern army draws upon the latest in-
ventions of nearly all known sciences. Chemistry
has given it smokeless powder; and this, with the
magazine rifle and the rapid fire field gun, has
vastly increased the power of the defence, and
rendered a mistake in strategy disastrously costly.
Hence the importance of devices for giving and
transmitting intelligence—the balloon, the field
telegraph, and even the telephone, besides the
heliograph and the electric searchlight. The
balloonist uses photography for recording his
observations, and wireless telegraphy for sending
messages.
The scientific soldier is also experimenting with
the bicycle, the traction engine, and the auto-
mobile, with armored trains, portable shields for
infantrymen, and steam ploughs for throwing up
hasty entrenchments.
Terrible and deadly as are the weapons of to-
day, war is not likely to be prore destructive of
life, because troops are less exposed, and battles
depend on science as well as valor.
In fact, statistics of our war with the Boers,
show that the greatest mortality among our brave
soldiers was from disease, caused by exposure and
the severe life incidental to warfare.
Science is here resorted to, and provides us with
a defence that does not fail, and greatly lessens
mortality, especially among those of our heroes
who are attacked by kidney disease. The
scientific remedy is Warner’s Safe Cure. It has a
twenty-one years’ reputation behind it. It has
been tried by all classes in all countries, and is no
experiment. Mr. G. Rayner, of 297 Moray-street,
South Melbourne, gives evidence of the per-
manency of the benefit derived from taking
Warner’s Safe Cure. Writing on the 15th August
1900, he says: “Some eight or nine years ago
both myself and my wife suffered from kidney
disease. We were advised to try Warner’s Safe
Cure, and after taking some six or seven bottles
we were both completely restored to our former
health. Since then I have always kept a bottle in
the house, and if any of the family feel at all out
of sorts they take some as a tonic.” Science
triumphed in this instance, as it always will.*

Mr. J. Smith, manager of the Australia
Hotel, desires to contradict the rumor
that he is charging extortionate rates to
visitors during the time of the Common-
wealth celebrations. There is, however,
a very great demand upon the hotel’s
accommodation, and intending visitors
should communicate at once with the
manager if they wish to be sure of secu-
ring rooms.

Saving the Tax-Payer’s Pocket.
Ex-Premier Braddon, of Tasmania, writes to
the papers to point out that the Commonwealth
can keep itself and all the States afloat with a
Freetrade Revenue Tariff of 121, per cent. New
South Wales at present keeps afloat with a Free-
trade Protective Revenue Tariff of about 6 per
cent., and made up the shortage last year by
a PPlyi n ff £879,282 of loan funds to revenue pur-
poses. All the Freetrade papers talk more or less
about the Commonwealth raising £7,000,000 or so
by a revenue tariff, and the loudest Freetrade
apostle of them all, George Reid, says that Free-
trade is the great essential, the one pure and spot-
less commercial gospel—and urges the adoption of
a “ legitimate tariff,” so that trade won’t be free.
And all these Freetraders gibe at real Freetrade
when it is really advocated by some gentleman of
the Single Tax way of thinking, or other genuine
believer; and while they say that Freetrade
is the one essential they call the real
Freetrader an “ extremist ” and a “ crank ” and a
“ confiseator.” Yet there is no reason, save their
own lack of courage or lack of sincerity, why Free-
traders should not practise Freetrade. Here are
a few propositions which The Bulletin would
like to lay before some more than usually reason-
able Cobdenite:
(1) The Freetraders allege that Customs duties raise
the prices of the articles taxed to an extent equal to
twice or three times the duty. So they allege that, by
raising, say, £7,000,000 by a Commonwealth revenue
tariff they will be taking £14,000,000 or £21,000,000 out of
the people’s pockets. This, by their own allegation, is a
madly extravagant way to raise revenue.
(?) They also allege that direct taxation does not in-
volve any such loss—that the money taken from the
people ali goes into the Treasury. Therefore, by having
real Freetrade, and raising the Commonwealth’s required
£7,000,000 by direct taxation, they claim that they would
save the people about £7,000,000 or £14,000,000, or some
such trifle.
(3) And they flatly -Sfuse to save the people £7,000,000
or £14,000,000, or some such trifle.
(4) Even if they abandon their assertion of many years’
standing that customs duties raise prices far in excess of
the amount of the duty, and declare that their great
central argument has all along been a lie, and say that
customs duties only raise prices to the extent of the duty,
and that, whether £7,000,000 a year is raised by a tariff
or by direct taxation, the people only pay £7,000,000 in
all, the Freetrade Revenue-Tariffists have no case. If the
people pay exactly the same under Freetrade and direct
taxation as under a customs tariff, why not have Free-
trade, since the Freetraders say it is such a good thing 1
(5) If the people can pay £7,000,000 a year in revenue
duties it seems obvious that they can pay it in direct taxa-
tion. Itis a case of the same people paying the same amount
either way. Even if alO per cent, revenue duty only
puts up prices 10 per cent., which the Freetraders flatly
deny, direct taxation would be simply a case of the same
people paying the same money, and getting the alleged
blessings of Freetrade thrown in, and that is surely quite
simple. And if, as the Freetraders constantly assert, a
10 per cent, duty raises prices 20 or 30 per cent., then
they would save the people £7,000,000 or £14,000,000 by
having direct taxation, and no tariff at all. Also
there would be the alleged blessings of Freetrade thrown
in.
And yet there isn’t a Freetrader of the Reid-
Brad jon-Holder-Gillies-Wise-M‘Millan push
who will advocate putting oji the direct taxation
which they say is good, and taking off the Customs
duties which they say are bad, and saving the
people =£7,000,000 or £14,000,000 or so, by their
own showing, in the process. There isn’t one
who will advocate conferring on the people the
blessings, which he says, inevitably accrue from
Freetrade. They go all over the country proving
to their own complete satisfaction that if they
iike from a man 4s. in the £ income-tax, and put
the proceeds in the Treasury, lie only pays 45.,
while if the Treasury raises the same sum in
customs duties the tax-payer pays anywhere from
4s. to 12s. And if anypne asks them why they
don’t save the taxpayer all this alleged needless
outlay, and confer on him the alleged great blessing
of Freetrade, and live up to their alleged gospel,
they don’t even offer an explanation. They put
the questioner aside, as Reid did a lone, lean
Single-Taxer at Adelaide, with a pitying smile as
a self-evident crank. The Freetrade party, as
represented by Reid, M‘Millan, Gillies and Co.,
is almost the only party on earth which takes the
acceptance of its own doctrines as a proof of some-
thing approaching mental derangement.
Out-Back Schools— An Appeal to
Minister Perry.
“ Medi-cuss ” to The Bulletin re certain N.S.W.
out-back schools: —
I have not yet seen any public protest against the
criminal neglect of the health and comfort of the school
children of the far interior. Take, for instance, the
school at Tibooburra, farthest-out post-town in N.S.W.
Here the school building, a stone structure, is squatted
down on a sandy plain a few hundred yards from a line of
“ kopjes ” formed of large granite boulders from which,
in summer, radiate heat-waves that would put Hades to
the blush. The building has on the north side a so-called
verandah Bft. wide—the only shade procurable by the un-
fortunate children when they are turned out to play.
Play ? ye gods 1 a Tibooburra youngster in summer is too
tired to breathe—let alone play. The internal measure-
HE FORGOT HIMSELF.
M R. SNOOKS: “Hooray! At last the ambition
of my life is realised. They have elected me
president of the ”
MRS. SNOOKS: “ S-sh, you'll wake the baby!”
merits of this monument of departmental idiocy are
25 x 15 x 12ft. ; and in this pen over sixty children are
cooped up with the mercury in the coolest place in the
town standing at from 102 to 125, and, for days at a time,
at 116 ! To add to ■ horrors of this inferno, when, as
often happens, dust-storms rage, the doors and windows
have to be closed for an hour and more at a time,
and then it becomes a mere fight for existence.
The school is a mixed one, the pupils including,
besides whites —half, quarter, and eighth-aboriginals,
many of them innocent of soap ; so, with a full attend-
ance on a hot day, the smell must be left to the
imagination. Then the seating—as in nearly all N.S.W.
schools —is as barbarous as the lighting is inadequate ;
and, as a result of these combined circumstances, 70 per
cent, of the children Buffer from eye-disease of some kind.
After an experience of 14 years in the “ out-back ” of both
Q. and N.S.W., this writer unhesitatingly asserts that
there are more cases of ulceration of the cornea in Tiboo-
burra than in any place ten times its size in Australia ;
while, as for ophthalmia (inflammation of the eyes), you
can’t throw a stone at a goat without hitting some child
too blind to dodge. Also 70 per cent, of the children have
photophobia (intolerance of light) and granulation of the
eyelid is very common. Many children are almost totally
blind, and others, whose sight is greatly impaired, have
been disfigured for life through crass ignorance in treat-
ment. When a youngster shows symptoms of blight—
any affection of the eye in the bush is “blight”—the
mother rushes off (o the nearest store, and, procuring a
bottle of some astringent lotion, starts qualifying her
child for the use of a dog and a string by applying the
nostrum liberally to its eye. The danger with most of
these “ universal ” remedies is that they contain acetate of
lead ; and where there is an abrasion of the conjunctiva
(membrane covering the eye) as from a cut from a flying bit
of quartz, or where ulceration of the cornea exists, the lead
precipitates, leaving a white stain, which, if the injury be
over the “ sight,” greatly impairs vision. Some of the
“home-remedies” are unique. One man, to writer’s
knowledge, tried cayenne pepper, but he knows when he
has had enough. Not long since, whilst watching the
youngsters trooping home from school, a stranger pre-
sent remarked that he had never seen so many children
who evidently feared violence. Every other child in
passing raised the left forearm to the eyes as if warding
off a blow. The fact simply was that these children,
wanting to have a look at the stranger, could not do so
without shading their eyes. All these evils, of course, are
not due to badly-built and too small school-buildings ;
but many of them are ; and it is time the Education
Dept, awoke to the fact that from mid-November to mid-
March the schools at Tibooburra, Milparinka, White
Cliffs, Wanaaring, Hungerford and some other towns
west of the Darling should be closed. All other holidays
should be abolished in favor of this four, or at least three,
months’ term in places so cursed by their surroundings ;
and were this boon granted the teachers would be able to
get away for a short holiday instead of being tied
to the wilderness till they lose health, ambition
and hope. At present, how can a teacher afford to pay
£l2 coach-fare to Bourke and return, and then train-fare to
destination ? If he wants to get away at Xmas it takes
exactly 12 days to go and come, leaving him a bare two
weeks below—and not that, unless coach-dates suit.
However, once the Dept, gets its hirelings well' out-back
it conveniently forgets all about them. Instance : After
serving five years at Milparinka a teacher was ordered to
Tibooburra, 20 miles further out. He begged for a remo-
val “inside,” and was told he could get this after two
years at Tibooburra. That was eight years ago, and he is
as near a transfer as ever. Writer would like to shut up
the Departmental nincompoops in the little hell they call
a school at Tibooburra for 10 days, with the mercury at
120 ; then their hides—if not their hearts —might soften.
Converting Missionaries.
Writes The Bulletin’s London correspondent:
Not the least valuable result of the Imperial Boxers’
burst-up in China is the sudden education of the
general public here in the clumsy, massacre-provoking
methods of missionaries as a body. Premier Salisbury
opened the ball from his lofty altitude, and practically
said that many of the “sky-drummers” went on the
convert-trail in foreign lands with the idea that the
British flag and British lyddite were in their back-pockets
ready to avenge their chokers being pulled. Whereupon
other lesser personages, though better-informed travel-
lers, found courage, and have followed in stronger strains,
and altogether there is a very firm and crystallised
opinion spreading in political and bther influential circles
here that the “ concrete missionary ” is wholly respon-
sible for the Chinese outbreak, and worse—for the awful
Shanghai-ing (lying) foisted by correspondents on the
London press. It is not at all unlikely that the Govern-
ment will hint gently to the powerful and wealth}' mis-
sionary societies, with their fine offices and well-paid
“ top-notehers,” that in future sky-drummers, pushing
their doubtful wares on savage and ignorant (in English
eyes) foreign countries, will have no bell-wire connection
to the nearest British gunboat, but will have to carry
out their “drumming” so as not to irritate peoples,
though heathens, who respect their heathendom 10,000
times more than the average pretentious Christian really
respects his religion. There is to be much less of the
pom-pom, Long Tom, lance-and-bayonet pushing of God’s
word (the blasphemy of it!) down unwilling throats by
the side of their 25-centuries-old traditions, and ancient
temples. An experienced writer and world-traveller in
London Daily Mail says, “ The men who are sent out as
missionaries are too frequently persons who have failed
in other walks, and who take to this work as a last resort,-
as a certain means to get an income, and because they
thus cease to shift for themselves and have a Church or
rich society to lean upon. Ido not criticise the men for
this ;it is the system that is at fault. On the ship
bound for China I was struck by the mediocre mental
character of too yiany of the men. They were often
villagers and men of the narrowest horizon. It was these
who declared what they would do and have and would
not have when they reached their stations—as if the
Christianising of an ancient, a polished, and a highly-cul-
tivated race was to be carried out by a word of command
instead of by the most sage, deft, tactful, and sympa-
thetic means. 1 I’ll have no convert who permits his wife
to cramp her feet,’ said one, and that fairly illustrates the
mental attitude towards their work of too many whom I
met. Small feet, concubinage, even the reverent regard
of all good Chinamen for their ancestors, were to be
instantly discountenanced before the true modes of
life and worship were established in their places.”
Of course there is nothing paraly singly new in the
foregoing, but London dailies Lave never dared
say much until the past six or eight weeks.
the matter of compensation to in-
? jured workmen the practical and
humane German can give many points
to the unpractical Australian.
Under its Hickness and Accident
Insurance Acts Germany pro-
vides for compensation for all
disablement or death arising
from any accident which may
occur during work, from any
cause, even when occurring through
negligence; the sole exception being
for wilful self-injury. Compensa-
tion is fixed on the minimum-wage
basis, and neither workman nor
employer is permitted to contract
out of the Act or reduce the liability
in any way. The absurd doctrine
of common employment is utterly
abolished. The German Acts further
impose on the employer the obliga-
tion to insure each and all of his work-
ers at his own cost. And, after a trifling
initial objection, the employer did as he
was ordered, and made no bones about the
matter. He discovered that his industry
wasn’t handicapped, nor was any capital driven
out of the country ; on the contrary, it worked both
for the benefit of himself and his employes. He
simply pays a trilling insurance-fee per head to a
guarantee co., and charges it to cost of production,
and as all his competitors work under the same
conditions he is in no way handicapped in his in-
dustry. Does the Australian reckon himself men-
tally inferior to the German that he makes such
grievous trouble over a matter which Herr Sauer-
kraut has settled so simply and effectually ?

A Tory Paper on the Sins of Labour.
Some strangely ignorant characters undertake the
work of instructing the people in the press of this
great country. For instance, here is a sample
from Launceston (Tas.) Examinee, of 28th
November :
In Australasia, statisticians tell us, millions of pounds
sterling are lying in the banks nob bearing interest, and
presumably the reason of this is that capitalists are at a
loss to discover safe channels fur investment. The pro-
fessional agitator is to no small extent responsible for
this state of affairs, and the sooner the working man, who
would be benefited by the letting loose of this money in
legitimate enterprise, recognises this fact the better for
himself personally and the country generally. The poll -
tician or agitator who deliberately sets labour at the
throat of capital is a traitor to the cause he is supposed
to uphold, and an enemy to the community at large.
Even the humblest Socialistic Domain orator or
Yarra-sider, who howls loosely in a husky beer-
voice about ‘ ‘ the banks ” as the source of all evil,
isn’t so primitive in his notions of banking as that.
The Launceston Examinee’s idea of banking
seems to be something as follows :
The £25,000,000 or so of cash lying in the Austra-
lasian banks to meet withdrawals in the matter of the
£104,000,000 of deposits held by the banks, wouldn’t be
there if it wasn’t for the “ professional agitator.” At that
rate the “ professional agitator ” is the only person who
prevents the banks going broke.
The £25,000,000 wouldn’t be there if capitalists could
find “ safe channels for investment.” Whenever a capi-
talist finds a safe channel for investment—say, by start-
ing a newspaper, a fire insurance office, or a factory—he
takes his money out of the bank and keeps it out. Such
concerns as John Hunter’s boot factory, or the Colonial
Sugar Co., or the United Fire Insurance 00., or the S.M.
Herald don’t keep their money in banks. It is carried
about in the manager’s coat pocket.
The Launceston Examiner really can’t see that 400 big
enterprises might be started with this £25,000,000 that
are in the banks without reducing the average amount
in the banks in the least. Certainly the money would
pass a good deal from bank to bank by the passing of
cheques in payment for buildings, machinery, and
material. Also a good deal would be drawn out of the
factory-owners’ account for wages on Saturday, and it
would mostly be paid away at once for rent, clothes,
boots, and provisions, and be banked again to the credit
of the landlord and the grocer and others on Monday
morning. But the same old money would stay in the
bank practically all the time, and the Hanking returns,
which show the average amount of coin on hand, would
remain practically unchanged.
The Launceston Examiner’s idea of a prosperous State
is one where, by the suppression of the Socialist and the
agitator and the Labor party, the banks owe £104,000,000
of deposits and have no cash to pay with.
A good deal has certainly been said, with justice,
about the foolishness of keeping £25,000,000 of
coin in the Australasian banks, when they could
get through equally well with, say, £8,000,000 coin
and £17,000,000 of Government paper money, and
by using the coin thus released to pay off
£17,000,000 of public debt the country could save
about £650,000 a year interest. And the Launceston
Tory paper has muddled this idea up till it came
to the conclusion that it is a sinful waste for the
banks to have money of any kind to pay
cheques with. And so it promptly blamed the
existence of that money on the ‘ ‘ professional
agitator, ” who is responsible for everything, And
then it lashes out wildly as follows :
111-advised Labor-agitation has driven capital from
Great Britain, from Europe, the United States and Aus-
tralasia.
The Labor-party is thus not only responsible for
the sin of driving money awajq so that it isn’t
here when it should be, but it is also, and at the
same moment, responsible for all that capital in
the banks being here when it shouldn’t be. The
professional agitator has a great deal to answer
for. What with being the cause of the absence of
the cash that is present and the presence of the
cash that is absent, his case is so bad that his
wisest course is to fall up a tree and drown him-
self forthwith.
The Birkenhead (England) municipal council
owns the ferry service between Birkenhead and
Liverpool, and makes out of it a yeaily profit of
£12,000. This is the sort of English precedent
that Australia should follow. But there is a
grievous lack of discrimination about the follow-
ing of British precedents in Australia. The
system goes somewhat as follows :
Freetrade must be right because England says it is.
The system of steadily paying off the public debt by
sheer grit and enormous taxation is wrong though
England follows it.
Jingoism must be right because England is Jingo.
Municipal ownership of tramways, gas and electric-
lighting works, ferries, public baths, laundries, etc., is
wrong, though England believes in it and practises it.
England has an immense regard for titles and royalties
—tlieiefore that must be right.
England puts, its big cities under one simple, efficient
and comprehensive municipal government—not under 42
or 43 impotent little councils, as is the case in Sydney.
Therefore England must be wrong.
The ingenuity with which this country whoops
for England’s bad examples and scorns its good
ones is something marvellous.
♦ — ——
Weitten in June, 1861, by Dr. W. H. Russell,
Secession-War correspondent of London Times :
Admitting everything that can be said, I am the more
persuaded, from what I see, that the real foundation of
slavery in the Southern States lies in the power of obtain-
ing labour at will at a rate which cannot be controlled by
any combination of the labourers. Granting the heat and
the malaria, it is not for a moment to be argued that
planters could not find white men to do their work if
they would pay them for the risk. A negro, it is true,
bears heat well, and can toil under the blazing sun of
Louisiana, in the stifling air between the thick-set sugar-
canes ; but the Irishman who is employed in the stoke-
hole of a steamer is exposed to a higher temperature and
physical exertion even more arduous. The Irish labourer
can, however, set a value on his work ; the African
slave can only determine the amouut of work to be
got from him by the exhaustion of his powers. Again,
the indigo-planter in India, out from morn till night
amidst his ryots, or the sportsman toiling under the mid-
day sun through swamp and jungle, proves that the
white man can endure the utmost power of the hottest
sun in the world as well as the native. If the statistics of
negro mortality were rigidly examined I doubt that they
would exhibit as large a proportion of mortality and sick-
ness as would be found amongst gangs of white men
under similar circumstances. It is in the supposed
cheapness of slave labor and its profitable adaptation in
the production of Southern crops, that the whole gist and
essence of the question really lie. The labor of ditching,
trenching, cleaning the waste lands, and hewing down
the forests is generally done by Irish labourers, who
travel about the country under contractors, or are en-
gaged by resident gangsmen for the task.
Premier Turner proposes to reduce the
salary of the Victorian State Governor from
£7OOO to £5OOO. Think of it; £5OOO for the gaudy,
useless, and purely ornamental figurehead, while
the Premier, who is responsible for all the real
work of government, gets £lO4O ! If the figures
were reversed there would be some sense in the
arrangement. Yet the Assembly was so utterly
unable to see it that Prendergast’s proposal to
give the gilded loafer only £3OOO (nearly three
times as much as the Premier) was rejected by
75 to 2.

POLITICAL
POINTS
It is Announced that Lyne, if he enters
the Federal Parliament, hopes to instill John See
as N.S.W. Premier.
The Australian soldier in Africa gets
twice as much as the English. We could find any
number of Frenchmen to fight Boers with as much
enthusiasm at the price.”— Le Matin, Paris.
Voting by post came into operation for
the first time in Australia on 12th inst., at Vic.
Upper House Ministerial elections, when 41 con-
stituents thus polled in the Gippsland, and 111 in
the Western province.
Australia was talking of “ peace celebra-
tions,” but now comes a cable that Kitchener
wants all the colonial soldiers to stay, and that
over 200,000 British troops must be kept for the
present in England’s Poland.
Said Sam. ’Griffith in ’9l (“ Convention
Debates, ’91,” p. 490):
I have little doubt that before long the Constitutions
of many of these colonies will be changed, and very likely
. . . by the American system of having a convention
elected by the people for that duty only, and dissolving
after it has performed its duty.
Premier Turner persists in making his Old
Age Pension a reward of temperance and virtue,
and shuts out the immoral Don Juan of 65 and the
bad old man who gives way to beer. Victoria is
the State that pays about £350,000 a year to pen-
sion civil-servants utterly regardless of morals and
qualifications of any kind. It is only the poor
who are expected to be moral.
S.A. Assembly, on the day before it
adjourned, passed a special resolution releasing
Kingston from his pledge to stay in local polities
until he secures Leg. Council reform, but, so far,
he has declined to publicly announce his
intentions. The ex-Premier is in a unique posi-
tion in that he would, as a Federal candidate, get
the block vote of his Tory enemies, who heartily
wish to see the last of him in local politics.
Spicer's Creek Farmers’ Union lias, it is
notified, declined as a body to support the candi-
dature of G. 11. Cox, M.L.C., for the Senate.
The ambition of Mr. Cox, a man of many excel-
lent qualities, is to sit in the first Federal Parlia-
ment, and he advances as his chief claim for sup-
port that he was elected to the first N.S.W.
Parliament under responsible Govt, He has been
37 years in the Leg. Council, and recently cele-
brated his 76th birthdaj. As N.S.W. can put
only six men in the Senate, Mr. Cox’s chances of
a seat are not encouraging. Around Mudgee he
has staunch friends, and, as he was born and bred
there, many look upon him as a patriarchal relative.
THE SILENT MEMBER.
THE OLD MAN: "By Jingo, mother, that cove wavin’ his flute orter he sacked. He ain’t played
a note on it all night.”
G. R. Dibbs is credited with actually
welcoming the thought of an Australian Parlia-
ment. The reason given is that G. R. D. is ap-
palled at the depth to which the N.S.W. Legis-
ture has descended. Anything to save the people
from it is his idea. Sydney D.T. is also horrified
at the way N.S.W. Assembly has been conducting
Sublic business, Premier Lyne, as leader of the
iovt., is alone responsible for this condition of
Parliament, yet both Dibbs and the D.T. have been
barracking for Lyne as leader of the Federal
Parliament!
At the bidding of David Syme—he is
surely going to be a Baronet—Premier Turner is
S°' n g to hustle for a Spring-st. monument to
‘Bobs,'’ who “led the English and Australian
soldiers to such dazzling victories.” “Dazzling
victories ” of lions over wire-haired terriers.
Well, provide the stone, by all means. It will be
useful to throw at the Jingoes one of these days.
From a Maorilander who went to S’Africa
nine months ago :
This is a capitalists’ war all right enough. I did not
think so before I came here, but I have since altered my
opinion. Before the war the railway employes were
getting from £l6 to £35 per month, now the Imperial
Govt, works the lines and pays from £6 to £lB—a nice
example to set the capitalist. Men who were in receipt
of £1 per shift now draw less than half, with the extra
risks of warfare thrown in. . . . None of the Outlanders
I have met are satisfied ; they all say they did not want
war, as they were making plenty money, and that was
what took them to the Transvaal. None of them had
any desire to reside permanently in the country, but to
make a “bit” and then clear. Advise no one to come
here. I myself will soon be back in M.L.
Seeing that the 20 or so municipalities of
Adelaide are no nearer agreeing to a scheme of
municipal tramway ownership; and Bingham’s
scheme for a big private tram monopoly has, it
would seem, happily perished ; and Snow’s much
more outrageous scheme for another private tram
monopoly didn’t get through Parliament ; and
the present company-owned Adelaide horse-
trams are a disgrace to a civilised city—does the
allegedly democratic Premier Holder propose to
move at any reasonably adjacent date in the
direction of establishing an up-to-date State-
owned system of electric trams ? Or is that hesi-
tating shadow-turned-sideways altogether a
failure ?
The Westralian Assembly has made a
better fight than was expected over its democratic
Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. The Leg.
Council spotted the Bill all over with Tory
amendments, of which the worst was probably
the one which provided that lawyers might appear
in the Arbitration Court. This abolished the
original idea of deciding cases according to
“equity and good conscience,” and made the
Conciliation Court a place where the man with
the longest purse could win by wrecking his oppo-
nent witli law expenses. The Assembly cheer-
fully accepted the Council's amendment with the
further amendment—that each side should pay its
own lawyer if it wanted one. When last heard of
the Council was swearing considerably. Yet it
can’t say openly that its idea was to enable the
rich man to down the poor one by first defeating
him on a technical point and then leaving him to
pay for seven or eight useless barristers.
The Bulletin's London correspondent :
The horror of the British officer at the “brutishness”
of the Australian troops is widespread. In the military
clubs yarns of their savage callousness (amply confirmed
by their own naively-savage accounts of their adventures,
written to friends and printed with unconscious malice
by Australian editors) make the “gallant and red” eyes
of old Indian military filibusters glitter and their lips
twitch as they sputter to the honor of the puff-box and
kid-glove brigade : “By gad ! sir, they’re the men we
want. They're, the men that made the Empire, they did,
by Gad —by Gad.” And Jean Carrfere courteously says in
Paris Matin that the colonial troops “ were mostly col-
lected scum, robbers of the worst sort among them,
especially Australians. The regulars envied them their
higher pay. . . Lord Roberts was greatly excited by their
robberies and scandalous deeds,” &c. This is all fine to
hear. If Australia is entering into the great trade of
bloodletting let her do so in a generous wholesale manner
and give the Boers, or anyone in the ring, carminative
Hades in soup-ladles. It is a useful, credit-inducing re-
putation to bear, that of a bavonet-bowel-excavator, and
if we’ve got to scrap to prevent ourselves being pushed
off the earth, or to push anyone off the earth we want,
let us do so with vigor and vim. Ah ! my blood is up !
let’s go and wait for the infant-school to come out.
That tricky fakir, Dry Dog Reid, now
doubtless realises the hideous blunder he made in
’9B. Had he refused to countenance the unfair
imposition of the minimum-affirmative-vote handi-
cap, had he fought tooth-and-nail from the first
for the Commonwealth Bill, the Commonwealth
would probably have started while he was still in
office, and then the Federal Premiership would
have been his. Also, Barton would have lost the
splendid advertisement he gained in the second
Federal fight, for there would have been no second
fight. It pays sometimes to go straight.
THE IDOLISED AND THE IDEAL.
CINTHIA : “ Yah! ’nother one of these ’ere dead crook societies
fer admiring pot-bellied earls and knock-kneed dukes,
and other sich things. They kin ’ave them on their
own. But fer a real ’andsome, proper sort of man
gimme our butcher.”
Premier Turner has put through the Yic.
Lower House a sort of temporary Old Age Pen-
sion Bill, to last for six months, pending the
enactment of a larger permanent measure. Said
Bill provides for the payment—out of an appro-
priation of £75,000—0f 10s. a week to persons over
65 and to any person, irrespective of age, who is
permanently incapacitated. Applicants must
have arrived in Victoria not less than 20 years
ago, and must not have been absent from Austra-
lasia since then more than five years altogether ;
must not have been convicted more than four
times in the previous 10 years for drunkenness,
must not have been imprisoned for 5 years during
the 20, and must not have failed to maintain wife
and children (if they possess such). Applications to
be sent in to the Treasury and decided by a P. M.
in private court. The N.S.W Old Age Pensions
don’t become payable till Ist July, so Victoria
may have the first Old Age Pension scheme actu-
ally working in Australia, as well as the first
minimum wage.
The Queensland Civil Service is shedding
its Jingo skin, and clothing itself in ashes and
sackcloth, and cursing the Transvaal war with a
towering curse. Premier Philp lately threatened
a big reduction in Civil Service salaries next year,
and the further decline of the revenue now makes
the thing almost certain. The pastoral industry
is half-ruined through the drought, the sugar-crop
is a failure in the southern districts, and the
mining outlook is not too promising. Queens-
land might have got over this by economy, but
while revenue has dropped the gaudy war-bill has
swelled expenditure enormously. The Queens-
land Jingo Fat Man refuses to pay either land or
income tax to cover the military outgoings; and
the civil servant, who was also very Jingo, as a
rule, is to pay for his own and other people’s
Jingoism. Brisbane Telegraph, with its usual
brilliance, assures the public that it is all owing
to Federation, which caused the drought and the
sugar failure and the war-bill; but even that is
poor consolation.
Canterbury Times (Christ-
church, M.L.), in its slavish anxiety
to be more English than the English
themselves, almost demands war
with Holland because a Dutch war-
ship afforded President Kruger a
refuge and carried him to Europe.
Yet a British consul afforded refuge
to President Balmaceda in far less
justifiable circumstances, and when
Balmaceda, foreseeing his down-
fall, stole the contents of the
Chilian Treasury a British war-
vessel carried the money away for
him to a place of safety—though
Balmaceda didn’t live to enjoy it.
Affording a refuge to fallen rulers
is one of the ordinary occupations of
neutral war-vessels. If Holland
had invited the Cape rebels to
Amsterdam and given them an
official reception, as some English
cities did in the case of the Hun-
garian rebels of ’4B, then there
might have been something to talk
about.
Big John Forrest has so far
improved and liberalised things in
Westralia that under his new
Electoral Law the smallest constituency has one
Assembly member for 107 electors, while the
largest has one member for 5930. Eight electorates
where the old gropers congregate have eight mem-
bers for 2365 voters; eight mining electorates
where the Uitlanders are strong have eight mem-
bersfor3s,2o6 voters. Andthisis under Boer John’s
reformed system. And this country, including
Boer John, is still mad because Boer Paul didn’t
give proper representation to his Outlanders.
Landlord Terry, the early-bird candidate
for a seat in the Senate, approaches the newspaper-
postage question from a new point of view. He
pronounces in favor of newspaper-postage, but
will permit papers to go free within a radius of
30 miles. This gets at the big city papers and
saves the semi-bankrupt little country rag from
total extinction.
The members of the un-
necessary Royal Commission,,
which Premier Lyne sends from
N.S.W. to Maoriland to study-
the Arbitration Act in force there,
will, it is understood, be paid f
guineas a sitting and travelling
expenses. If Dear Old Bill
doesn’t soon give over sending
five or six men to do one man’s
work at 12 men’s wages, some-
thing will smash.
When the Transvaal Con-
cessions Commission- inquired
into the monopolies and subsi-
dies granted to certain Hollander
and Africander firms by Kruger
and his Doppers, they found
nothing any worse than is granted
by N.S.W. Government to
Sydney Daily Telegraph and
S.M. Herald. When Kruger
and his Doppers granted anybody
a monoply, the Boer State got
some of the profits; but in
N.S.W. the papers get free car-
riage for their country editions,
remunerative billets for their
directors, titles for their pro-
prietors, and have their special
war-correspondents paid by the
State —all for nothing.
A fine sample of Tory in-
telligence from leading article in
Adelaide Rrgister of Nov. 2(3: —
The general tendency of socialistic laws is to stifle in-
dividual excellence, and plane a whole community down
to dull mediocrity. . . . What prospect can be more dis-
mal for the world than the appearance of a system which
would remove from the submerged tenth —socialism is
tending to make it a twentieth— their only hope of real
salvation.
The Register is evidently run by that agricul-
tural person to whom two miners applied for
permission to dig for gold, offering him a fourth
of the product, and who indignantly refused to
take less than a fifth. Then the miners, in a burst
of generosity, offered to go as high as a tenth, and
the agricultural one was so pleased that lie signed
the agreement at once and gave them a bottle of
whisky as well.
The pretty little pavilion in which the
Governor-General was welcomed last Saturday
was sadly blurred by a huge streak of beastly pro-
vincialism. Outside were shields representing the
different great divisions of the British Empire.
Inside were the names of the various States and
of four prominent Walers —Parkes, Lyne, Reid
and Barton. No word of the men from the other
portions of the Commonwealth who helped to
build up the nation, and of those who were men-
tioned Lyne was a rank opponent, and Reid simply
regarded the whole matter from the standpoint
of how it affected G. H. Reid —when he thought
it was against his interests he jumped on it with
both feet, and when he thought it was going to
help the cause of G. H. Reid he pushed it along
with all the weight of his great corporation. Hori
Grey, Kingston, Deakm, Braddon, Isaacs,
Turner, and the others were not Walers, and were
therefore of an inferior kind of clay, and utterly
unworthy of mention on the same cardboard as
the demigods of the Mother State.
Some items from the report of the debate
in Queensland Assembly on the Mount Garnet
Freehold Mining Co.’s Railway Bill (Brisbane
Courier, 11th Dec.) :
Mr. Higgs moved the insertion of a new clause to pro-
vide that no member of the Leg. Assembly or the Leg.
Council can hold shares or any pecuniary interest in the
company.
Mr. Murray said he could not accept the amendment,
which was a fae-simile of the one he declined to agree to
in connection with the Callide Bill.
Mr. J. Hamilton argued that it would he absurd to
throw out a measure of this kind simply because a mem-
ber of the House happened to possess a few shares in the
company.
Mr. Givens: “ Have you any shares in this company ? ”
Mr. J. Hamilton : “I have none.”
Mr. Givens : “ Well, your name appears on the list of
shareholders.”
Mr. J. Hamilton : “ What! my name? ”
Mr. Givens : “Yes, your name —John Hamilton, M.L.A.’*'
Mr. J. Hamilton : “ Where did you see it?”
Mr. Reid : “ It was published in the papers.”
Mr. J. Hamilton : “ Well, I know nothing about it. I
don’t even know the directorate. I wish I did have a few
shares in it.”
And the House didn’t even stop to inquire into
the case of this perfectly unconscious alleged
shareholder who was supporting the Bill so enthu-
siastically. Then again:
Mr. Givens challenged the vote of Mr. Newell, the mem-
ber for Woothakata, on the ground that he was pecu-
niarily interested in the measure.
The proposed new clause was negatived bv 26 votes tc>
20.
On the division being announced,
Mr. Givens again challenged the vote of uie hon. mem-
ber for Woothakata, and claimed that it be disallowed.
The Chairman having asked the member for Wootha-
kata if he was interested in the Bill,
Mr. Newell said the firm of which he was a member had
bought some shares in the Mount Garnet Company, but
outside those shares he was not personally interested in
the company.
A Voice : “ And yet you voted.”
Mr. Newell remarked that if any exception was taken
to his vote he would withdraw it.
The Chairman said he would accept the hon. member’s
statement that he was not personally interested in the
Bill.
Considering that the hon. member had just ad-
mitted in the frankest possible way that he wai
personally interested in the Bill he was support-
ing, the Chairman’s anxiety to accept the assur-
ance (which he hadn’t given) that he wasn’t
interested was pathetic.

A TERRIBLE CASE OF SUFFERING CURED BY THE
USE OF VITADATIO.
Brisbane-st., Launceston, Tas.
W. Costain begs to intimate to his many friends and
the public generally, that Vitadatio, that marvellous
remedy, has worked a miracle. I have suffered many
years from Gravel and Liver Complaints, which brought
about a complication of diseases. Some twelve months
ago I had a paralj'tic stroke, which almost proved fatal.
I got about again, but it left me with Asthma and
Bronchitis, which up to two months back I could get
nothing to relieve me of. I was advised to try your Vita-
datio. I did so. Before I had been taking it a week I
began to improve, and have done so up to the present
time. I continued your medicine. Up to date, lam
feeling better than I have done for years.
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) W. OOSTAIN.

For the Breelong (N.S.W.) murders the
aboriginal Jimmy Governor, it is announced, is to
be hanged at Darlinghurst Gaol, Sydney, and
Jacky Underwood at Dubbo Gaol. About the
middle of January is fixed for the “scraggings ”
well within the echoes of the Commonwealth re-
joicings. The extreme and unusual length of the
period thus elapsing between conviction and exe-
cution is put down to an official idea that it would
be unbecoming to have any executions while we
were celebrating the birth of the Commonwealth.
But away with such hypocrisy ! Hang it all, let
us be natural.
A divorce case heard recently at Bendigo
(Vic.) drove the excited Judge Hood to remark
that he thought half Mildura would get into gaol
before the case was over. The trouble began last
June, when a butcher from the cold-tea township
got a decree nisi against his wife on the ground of
the usual trouble with a young man who admitted
that he was sometimes not quite right in his
mind. There was no defence. The case was re-
opened, however, and the wife declared that she
didn’t appear on the first occasion because her
butcher had left her without the money to pay
her fare to Bendigo. Also the young man who
was not always quite right in his mind turned up
and declared that he didn’t appear on the first
occasion because he had been paid £2 ss. to be an
absent co-respondent—which seems very much
below a fair minimum wage. Two female wit-
nesses fainted in the box, and a third had violent
hysterics, and what with them, and the hea,t, and
the man who wasn’t always right in his mind,
and sundry apparent perjurers, Judge Hood grew
almost distracted beneath his wig, and spoke dis-
paragingly of Chaffey’s irrigated town on the
Murray, and rescinded the original decree, and
shovelled costs around lavishly, and committed
two men for perjury on the spot.
“Marconi, whom I first interviewed for
The Bulletin in ’96,” writes our London corres-
pondent, “has of late accomplished two victories
of enormous importance. He has realised in prac-
tical working what might be termed ‘Duplex
Wireless Telegraphy,’and he no longer needs a
‘receiving’ mast towering into the atmosphere
with a ‘ lightning-conductor ’ to catch the coming
message and turn it into the instrument for inter-
pretation—now the instruments may lie on the
ground. In ordinary telegraphy the duplex sys-
tem allows of a message from one end of the line
passing without confusion, a message from the
other end simultaneously being transmitted. Thus
lines are economised, and one made to do the
work of two. The current from one end is of a
‘ different strength ’ to that from the other, and
they do not clash nor ‘ melt ’ together. Marconi
accomplishes his duplex thus : Each of his re-
ceivers is put in tune with its fellow transmitter,
so that when the latter calls from 60 or 70 miles
distant, though there may be a dozen receivers on
the same table, only those accurately attuned to
the calling transmitter will register its signals.
This was tested severely by placing a transmitter
at (say) each of two angles of a triangle and two
receivers (of diverse tunings) on top of each other
and connected to the one mast wire at the remain-
ing angle. _ One transmitter signalled in French,
the other in English, and the messages came
through without incoherence and without confu-
sion. He is a great, modest young man, is Mar-
coni, who would be greater were he not so modest,
for the baby-puppy-blind G.P.O. has snubbed
him so that if he had had any conceit he would
have shrivelled up and passed away in one of his
own Hertzian waves.”
The return to London of the City Imperial
Volunteers occasioned even more hysteria than
Mafeking Day. In tlie joyous ructions 10 persons
were killed and over 200 badly injured—a heavier
list of casualties than the regiment sustained in
all its 26 engagements ! Stands were overloaded
and collapsed, women fainted or stumbled and
were trampled to death. One fervid person,
leaning too far out of a four-storey window, over-
balanced and fell, killing one woman and maiming
two others. He escaped uninjured ! Drink and
excitement —mad throngs fighting, surging, and
swearing half through the night for the right of
way down the narrow streets. Verily the
soldier’s is one of the healthiest occupations going.

“In military circles here, it is said,
writes a London correspondent to The Bulletin,
“that the royal road to promotion lies through
the goodwill and favor of Lady Jeune, the noted
divorce-Judge’s wife, and Sir Evelyn Wood, her
esteemed friend at the War Office.” The lady’s
“ working in the dark, behind the scenes,” says a
London paper, “excites as much curiosity as did
the actions of the supposed veiled lady in the
Dreyfus case.”
A London Daily Express correspondent,
who travelled over the Trans-Siberian Railway
just before the Manchus rushed Blagovaschensk,
writes of the Amur district as a delightful place
where the train passed through picturesque
forests and fertile plains covered with waving
corn. The whole country is described as being
ablaze with beautiful spring flowers of many
varieties, such as peonies, lilies-of-the-valley and
yellow lane# lilies. The “Called Back ” version
of Siberia, as a place where mountains of ice are
only relieved by plains of snow, is breaking up.
Even if Britain can grab and hold all Southern
Asia it is doubtful if she will have nearly as good
a selection as the White Czar has in his alleged
northern wildernesses.
An Australian non-commissioned officer of
mounted infantry to a Sydney friend :
Just don't you swallow all you read about the treachery
of the Bj is in using explosive (expanding) bullets as
contrasted with the spotless virtuousness and humanity
of our s.de. The Boers often shove a nick or two into the
end of their missiles, and when we know—sometimes
long before we know—that nicked bullets are coming our
way— well, do you think we are such holy Joes that we
quietly he each behind his particular rock and send the
good, Christ'an British regulation article to our friends
opposite? No Sir, not iir.ch—at least, not very much.
Dear hoy, we are firing nicked bullets quite half the time
—all the time, in fact, when we have time to file them.
I shall be glad when this hideous business is over. There
is no glory in it I tell you—except for the men (and
women, plenty of them) who are fighting for their homes.
I hope this isn’t treason ; but, whether it is or not, it’s
God’s holy truth.
HAVE YOU
A BAD LEG
with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and sw'olleu that when you
pre s your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue w r ill deprive you of the power to
walk You may have attended various hospitals and had
medical advice, and been told your case is hopeless, or
advised to submit to amputation ; but do not, for I CAN
CUIID YOU. I don’t say perhaps ; but I WILL. Because
others have failed is no reason for not now being cured.

DEATH FOR A
WAITER.—When a
man suffers from ne-
glected indigestion,
constipation, and tor-
pidity of the liver, he
he soon loses all enjoy-
ment of his meals.
Nothing tastes good or looks appetizing. He
grumbles at his wife, or the cook, or the landlady,
or the waiter, as the case may be. People say he
is “hard to please,” and let it go at that. The
fact is that the man is in a precarious condition,
and if he continues to neglect his health, is a
candidate for consumption, or some equally
terrible malady. If a man does not wish to “dine
with Death for a waiter,” he should take the
right remedy for ‘ ‘ little ills ” as they arise, and
thus ward off the “big ones.” When a man’s
appetite is poor, when his liver is torpid, when he
feels “headachey,” dull, listless, and generally
out of sorts, he should take Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills. They make the appetite keen, the
liver active, the blood pure, and the body
energetic. They cure that trouble called con-
stipation, which.is the starting point of many ills.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, cure it positively,
certainly, infallibly; cure it so it stays cured;
cure it so you can stop taking medicine. And
this is something no other remedy will do. “ I
have experienced great benefit from the use of
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, which I have tried
for habitual constipation, from which I have been
a sufferer for many years. As I have tried many
remedies for this common complaint, I am in a
position to testify that they are the best medicine
1 have ever taken. I never had anything to go so
well through the system, and to set me right so
quickly. Also, they act very agreeably, never
causing pain, as is the case with so many cures for
Indigestion. I would advise anybody suffering
from constipation to try them.” Mr. T. Thorpe,
51 Stewart-street, Richmond, Vic., submits
his testimony in favor of this remedy. Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills positively cure bilious-
ness, indigestion, constipation, dyspepsia, head-
aches, liver and kidney complaints, piles, pimples,
and blotches. Sold by chemists and storekeepers,
price Is. per bottle or six bottles 6s. 6d. Sole

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Sydney didn t interest itself much in S.A.-
N.S.W. cricket match this week. Enthusiasts experi-
enced a big set-back when N.S. W. went in first and went
out for 279-. They were looked to for at least 500 or 600.
A. Hopkins, 65, and 8. Gregory, 61 (both stumped by
Jarvis), were the only two to make anything like a stand.
On Monday B.A. kept the visitors in the field all day,
and totted up 811 for six wickets. Not-out men were
Hill (176) aud Matthews (4).
• * » •
South Australia has been beaten by Victoria at
cricket six times in succession, yet, excluding the match
played this week, she has defeated N.S.W. in three out of
the last five games. These facts show the uncertainty of
cricket, as N.S.W. seems to be the strongest state just
now, with Victoria a good second.
• * • •
The initial cricket match ’tween N.S.W. and
S.A. was played 10 years ago. Personnel of. the wheat-
State side in this week’s match only included three (G.
Giffen, F. Jarvis, and Beedman) who played for S.A. on
the first occasion.

Ernest Jones’ old-time title of “lightning”
bowler no longer applies. This year he has lost nearly all
his pace, and seems to be going the same road as other
fast bowlers with even more than usual rapidity. In for-
mer days, when he kept in form by doing hard work dur-
ing the day, “ Jonah” was a wonder ; now he is merely
medium pace.
* * * *
Veteran batsman Alick Bannerman shows
symptoms of returning form, and may possibly be seen in
big matches again. Up to now he has notched 56 for
once out this season.
* • * •
In Sydney first grade cricket so far this season
Bilowell is ahead at bowling—2o wickets for 231. M. A.
Noble has 9 for 178, and Vic. Trumper 17 for 183.
* * * ,
“ Point ” : Q. Cricket Association’s request that
the exes, of its team visiting Sydney at Xmas should
be paid is, all matters weighed, the coolest thing that
State has produced since summer began. The idea much
tickled N.S.W.; Victoria’s second eleven would supply
better cricket, and attract more “ gate.”
• * • *
S.A.C.A. has been unable to secure hotel-room
for the team which visits Sydney in the first week in
Jan., and it has been decided that they shall put up in
the pavilion if Sydney ground-trustees consent. The
only alternative is for Giffen, Hill and Co. to doss in the
Domain along with the proud English noblemen whose
remittances have gone wrong.
* » * *
Suggested that Joe Darling should be invited to
play for S.A. in Sydney, against N.S.W., on Jan. 5. At
present he has decided to remain in Tasmania until the
middle of January, by which date S.A. will have finished
her inter state programme. The great left-hander would
be a big draw.

Melb. Austral final was run on Saturday amid
a succession of extremely noxious rumors and a method
of running that gave a semblance of truth to some of
these. The less said about the race the better. The
other events gave the evergreen Bill Martin the chance of
showing up his present form, for the man of the iron jaw
carried off the Victoria Mile in great style, had it all his
own way in the ten-mile scratch, and was beaten in the
Flying Stakes of half-a-mile only by the cuteness of young
Gordon, who jumped at an unexpected time and left the
field no opportunity of getting going again. The two-
mile handicap for Austral competitors blocked by the
League trouble fell to the lanky Farley, who surprised all
by beating the Sydneysider Mutton in' the final sprint.
* * * *
M.L. 27yr.-old cyclist A. O. Forbes (winner of
Austral wheel race and attendant £4OO in Melb., Satur-
day) has been riding syrs. as a pro., and is among the best
known at the game on this continent: Though starting
an outsider in the betting, he was backed that morning
to win £lOOO. O’Callaghan and Champness were the
favourites. Forbes was on 30.yds., and won in 419 3-5,
thus setting up a record for the race, and a world’s
“ best” for a grass track. Attendance numbered 24,000.
“ Gate ” panned out well. The three days’ total reached
£2400. This, with entrance fees and proceeds from sale of
programmes, &c., leaves a net profit of perhaps £l5OO.
* * * *
The result of the Austral was presumably gall
and wormwood to Bill Martin. The Plugger, by scratch-
ing himself for his heat, missed an easy chance of captur-
ing the big stake. Had he been in the final, to take com-
mand of the back-mark lot, the race would have ended
(bar accidents) in an easy win for Bill, with Morgan
second, a fair distance ahead of Forbes. As it was,
Morgan, by his plucky determination to make sure of one
of the places, gave the first prize to the Maorilander, who
had been waiting on him for l£ furlongs ere he put on a
decisive spurt.
* * * *
Billmartin, who cleared over £5OO in Melbourne
by his recent wins, has finally decided to settle there, and
intends (following the example of Parsons) opening a city
hotel.
« * * *
Vancouver Mail tells that, on Oct. 25, Yankee
top-notcher Stinson brought the world’s hour cycling re-
cord up to 327yds. over 40 miles. Previous best (39 miles
1456yd5., accomplished a week before) was his own. A
motor quadruplet and three motor tandems aided him.
Prior to this Stinson wiped out Frenchman Bauge’s long-
standing feat of 39m. 1111yds. He made his first appear-
ance as a pace-follower this season, and has done wonders.
The track whereon Stinson rode is a smooth-surfaced"
well-sheltered wooden one.

Monday night, at Sydney Gaiety A. 0., “ The
Poet ” and Melb. lightweight Willis fought a sprawling
battle, wherein there was little to applaud in the way of
skill save Willis’ ducking to avoid and occasional sprint-
ing ; but he had little to get away from, as “ The Poet ”
never shaped worse. The “ gods” liked it, and roared
appreciation from start to finish. The man of verses was
sluggish and moved heavily—the other kept continually
on the go. Once the two collided hard and came away
gashed about the cheek-bones—“ Poet’s” left and Willis’
right being opened. Another peculiar thing occurred.
Shoe-strings became entangled while some wild work
went on, and the referee had to stoop and release them.
Ultimately, in the ninth round, Mac got a stiff right on
the point and went down limp. Some of the crowd
called it a good mill, but any two untaught navvies would
put up a better one of its sort.
* • * *
Marvellous how prolific. Bananaland is in top-
notchers that Bananaland never heard anything about as
such ; at least, so ’twould seem from the number of
“champions of Queensland ” one Sydney boxing-hall has
billed at different times. Latest was “Bill” Davis, who
met N.S.W. Permanent Artilleryman Thompson on Satur-
day night and took an awful thumping throughout
lOJmins. of actual fight—and then only left the ring
when the referee interposed. Curious that a novice in
his first public essay should ladle out so much gruel to
the champion of any where— much less Q. As far as skill
went Davis shouldn’t be champion of his own street, if
anyone else there had the merest inkling of the game, but
he owns more grit than many a champion boxer.
“ Jab ” : As showing the reliability of poundage
announcements in Sydney boxing-halls, it might be men-
tioned that two weeks ago, when Billy M’Kell fought and
whipped bantam champ. Bert. Weekes, his (M'Kell’s)
weight was given by the referee as 8.4. Bulletin par.
15/12, *OO doubted the accuracy of the statement, and said
straight out that M'Kell weighed a stone more than
Weekes, who scaled 7.13. T’other day Weekes challenged
M’Kell to another match, and offered to back himself for
£25 if Mac would undertake to bring not more than 8.4
of flesh and bone into the ring with him, but M’Kell
begged to be excused. This writer doesn’t think it
possible for M’Kell to shape at less than 8.7.
• * * *
S. Melbourne’s miniature giant, Jack M'Gowan,
fights the Sydney “Rocks” development, “Oocker”
Tweedie, at Gaiety A.C. (Sydney) Xmas Eve. Same pair
met a year or so ago in Brisbane, when Tweedie piled
points up in such fashion that it looked any odds on him,
but little Jack bided his time till the 13th round, when,
catching “Cocker” at some “ gallery play,” he swung the
right with piston-rod like precision and sent Tweedie star-
gazing. “ Cocker ” says “ he’ll have no cinch dis time —I
ain’t goin to be caught dat way again.” All the same,
writer looks for some like happening, as Tweedie is
always apt to get careless when things are coming his
way. That’s how Californian lightweight Lawler got him
m ’Frisco and blocked his first American trip on the
threshold.
* * • •
Maori Ruenalf came to Sydney from Queensland
t’other day and ratified a match with ink-hued Ike
Stewart, to happen Jan. 8. Both contributed to a good
stake and are now training hard. Ike is no wonder, but
writer likes his chance best. There seems little Maori
about “Ruenalf” though the owner of the name is in-
disputably a half-caste. Ruenalf is Flaneur backwards
and was the name of Sydney Teddy Keys’ sensational nag
who started red-hot for Melb. Cup a few years back, and
essayed winning from end to end as did Lancaster this
year, with about the same result.
* * * »
The downfall of Sydney Tim Nolan at the hands
of Tut Ryan in Melb. on Saturday was predicted herein
last week. The lumbering Tim has nothing to recom-
mend him but grit, strength, and the ability to land a
hard punch if t’other man gets close enough and lets
him. His ideas are more crude than ancient Cribb’s,
and his shaping recalls old-time pictures of Molyneux
and co. Noian hadn’t trained two weeks, hence his con-
dition soon found him out, and Tut banged the sturdy
Sydneyite as hard and often as he liked. Tim gave in
at the end of the seventh round, hardly able to lift a
limb.
• • * »
News per Mariposa is that Australian top-notch
middle-weight Tim Murphy (brother of erratic “Torpedo”
Billy) experienced another stroke of ill-luck in Chicago.
Lathy Tim met the crack Boston colored middle-weight
Byers in a six-rounds battle, before a big crowd, who,
when ! twas over, howled for a draw at worst, but the
referee gave the black the money, amid deafening hoots.
Subsequently Tim became much in demand, and was
rushed by clubs for match-making purposes.
* * * •
A week later than the Byers’ affair, Tim
Murphy met another Yank (“Kid” Carter), also in
Chicago, and experienced a parlous time through waiting
to get a right home. Only in the last round of the
agreed-upon term did Tim shake himself up, and then he
had the “ Kid ” in a sorry state, but couldn’t out him
before the gong went. Points accumulated by Carter in
previous five rounds brought the verdict his way. Had
Murphy buckled-to earlier ’tis said he would certainly
have won. Carter is only a lad (20) but owns a reputation
second to none right through the U.S. as a willing
thumper of the hard-hitting school.

“Old Timer”: Latest ’Ome mail brings news
of ancient bruiser Astley’s (“ Alf Trott’s ”) death at 80.
When his fighting days ended he blossomed into a
temperance-reformer and preacher and was at that game
to the last.
• * * *
“ Jab ” : Been looking up Yankee Terry
M’Govern’s record and conclude that his deeds top the
performances of all other champions. M’G. never met
defeat in 51 battles—thirty wins were knock-outs and 26
of them came about inside 10 rounds. He holds four
championships—bantam, feather, 1281 b (Amer.) and
featherweight supremacy of England. There isn’t an un-
defeated man in the other divisions.
* ■* * »
“ Pad ”: Looks now as if the famous colored
pugilist Pete Jackson is going to remain a wreck. After
being with Fitzgeralds’ circus and having an easy time
for a couple of months, cold got such a grip of him in
Gippsland (Vie.) that he is now laid up in Geelong
Hospital suffering from the old trouble —sciatica. Dan
Fitz. has seen to it that Peter is well tended, and ’tis
hoped he’ll be about again in a couple of weeks, especially
if the weather keeps warm, but writer has misgivings on
that point.
* • * *
Australia’s most promising amateur “lepper”
is Yic. champion schoolboy, H. H. Hunter. At Melb.
Grammar-school, recently, he assailed the schoolboy re-
cord (20ft. 10jin.) owned by C. H. M. Watson, and beat
the figures by an inch. Subsequently he cleared 21ft. 7in.
Unfortunately the loose ground caused him to slip back
a foot; but for this bad luck the Vic. Amateur record
would have been his.
* ■* * *
Looks as if the ped. biz will boom again in
Sydney. M’Grory’s Novice Handicap (110yds.) at the one-
time Eldorado of the world’s cinder-track performers
(Sir Joseph Banks Hotel, Botany), drew 54 acceptors and
a paying crowd on Saturday. Betting was liberal on
every heat. Ultimate winner turned up in V. J.
Wholohan (7|yds.), who went out favorite at 5 to 4 on,
and got home by a yard in 10 2-5. Other events are
notified—some of them pretty rich.
*■ * * *
R.S.Y.S. race for Dr. M’Cormick’s cup on
Saturday was brimful of interest from end to end. A
fresh nor’easter proved just the thing wanted. Mr. W.
M. Mark’s Isea allowed every opposing boat (all of which
were in the 30ft class) 9min start over a 22-mile course
(“ inside ”) and won from the M.L. built “twin” craft
S. M. Dempster’s Petrel and Dr. Gordon Craig’s Heather,
which were never more than 60sec. apart throughout the
whole journey. Time deductions gave Isea lmin 34sec.
advantage over Petrel which only finished llsec. in front
of Heather.
* * * •
Crack swimmer Fred. Lane is working himself
into fine fix. Saturday last, at East Sydney’s S.O. gala,
he tried to put up a world’s best for 120yds., and suc-
ceeded. Official time-keeper, Mr. “ Billy ” Kerr’s chrono-
graph showed 1.16 3-sths for the journey. This tops
everything previously done, but that fact'alone doesn’t
mean much, for the distance is rarely swum. Erstwhile
crack ’Ome amateur J. H. Tyers did the fastest (1.18) up
to Lane’s performance. Laps were measured to a fraction,
so that there shouldn’t be room for the slightest objec-
tion. Lane got through his task beautifully, and put a
heap of power into every stroke. His long lifting work
was a treat after the scratchy-splashy style most N.S.W.
swimmers affect. Writer predicts that,’ when Lane gets
into “ nick,” he’ll show all the rest that he’s still the abso-
lute front-ranker this side of the Line.
* * * *
Quarter-mile supremacy of N.S.W. at East
Sydney S.C. annual competitions on Saturday emphasised
writer’s opinion (formed on the occasion of the half-mile
chip three weeks ago) that Dick Cavill would probably
carry off all this season’s premierships ; also that though
the opposition has the pace, stamina is absent. Of seven
starters only two—Dick Cavill (winner) and Craig—
finished. Fourth lap (about 180yds. of journey) saw
“Mud” Bishop and “Snowy” Baker reach the end of
their tethers. Why (if unable to get over the distance)
they entered and paid for the privilege would be hard to
say. “ Mud” had a habit of doing same thing last year
and called forth the wrath of Association officials thereby,
but they took no serious steps to stop him. Bishop can
bullock over 100yds. with the best, but after that he’s
done. Others to cry ago at different stages were Smith,
Bond, and Reid. Reid made pace from the start and
swam neck and neck with Oavill for 200yds., but at about
350yds. stopped dead 4yds. behind Dick, who eventually
finished 15yds. in front of Oraig. Time (5.56) is 1 4-ssee.
slower than the Australasian best (Lane’s), done in
Sydney last year, and 12 4-ssee. behind Englishman
Tyers’ amateur record of ’94.

“ Under the old N.S.W. Fisheries Act,” Mr. J.
H. Want points out, “ amateur fishermen could and did
catch thousands of small and undersized fish. This in a
professional fisherman was a crime. The new Bill pre-
vents this, and the amateur who brings home sometimes
10 or 12 dozen red bream 2in. or 3in. long will know that
he is as much amenable to the law as the professional.”
It is quite a common thing to see scores and hundreds of
“ cockneys ” —young schnapper—weighing 2oz. each or
less—in the baskets of truly cockney fishermen. Hun-
dreds of thousands of dozen schnapper are thus nipped
in the bud every season in Port Jackson alone.

S.M. Herald’s Special Paymaster in China,
speaking of the game to he found round about Tien-tsin,
says that wild duck, geese, and waterfowl of all sorts
abound, but as there is only “one sporting rifle” in
camp the Australians don’t nab many. Fancy hunting
wildfowl with a sporting rifle 1

“ Tarquin” : Nance O’Neil has in quarantine, it
seems, a pair of “Boston terriers,” which, according to
the foggy descriptions of the local dog experts, appear to
be merely of the ordinary Yankeeland fighting-dog sort—
a type which, to judge from American sporting-print
illustrations, is a mixture of from half to three-quarters
bulldog with anything else you like to name, and which
would not be looked at for a moment on an English show-
bench. Just the sort of dog, in fact, of which present
writer once heard a Cockney expert say—“ These ’ere
happle-’eaded brutes never carries none o’ my money.
They’re too short in the grip to do any proper punishin’ ;
an[ they seldom sticks to it much above half-an-hour.”
Hix notion of a cocktail! Be Miss O’Neil’s dogs what
they may, however, it should surely shock her, as an
artist, to have her name in the same paragraph with such
details as “ Judge was bred to Gyp, a white bitch, and
from Judge and Gyp descended Wells’s Eph. Eph was
mated to Tobin’s Kate, and from Eph and Kate came
Tom, the first dog with a screwtail; the best of his day,
and much used at stud.”

Carbine-Duenna nag Pelissier (7.12 up, and Cis
Parker in the saddle), freshly back from the country, won
Moorefield Handicap (Sat.) by a head after a gruelling
finish with Mazzatina ( C. T. Goodby on top). ’Twas
simply a question of good riding at the end, and the
better jock won. Pelissier (6 to 4 agst.) was first favorite,
and Mazzatina (3 to 1 agst.) next. Pelissier is a syr-old.
Latest was the best race he had yet shown, though his
track gallops were always good. He is a full brother to
Amberite and Flintlock. Sydney trainer Duggan tried
hard to do something with him, but failed, and then re-
turned the unreliable to his breeder, Mr. J. Lee. Latter
handed him to Mr. E. Ingersole, of Bathurst, from which
time the nag was a disappointment no longer.
• • * *
A most promising nag is Yarrabee, who started
in last A.J.C. Derby', and who on Saturday annexed the
Stewards’ Mile at Moorefield in great style. Yarrabee is
by St. Swithin or The Levite, from the imported mare
Peggy by Chevron—Peg Fife, and is a well-grown animal,
of very taking appearance.
• • • *
On-track work, and with the certainty of much
improvement in the interim, Gameboy (4-year old, by
Goodfellow—Lady Monmouth), winner of' the Flying
Handicap at Moorfield (Sydney) on Saturday, looks the
best of good things for coming Carrington Stakes. He
humped 9.5 home and won easily from heavily-supported
Pardon, to whom he conceded 251 b. Previous Saturday
at Canterbury, with 51b. less in the saddle, same nag
on] y f>°t third in same Class of race. Gameboy will have
8.8 up (including 51b. penalty) in Carrington Stakes.

A new development of the Commonwealth
craze 1 Atop of the proposal to liberate prisoners and
turn them adrift so that they may have a cut at the com-
ing harvest, is the fact that a certain Sydney pony-club
purposes lifting a heap of disqualifications—ostensibly to
mark the advent of the Commonwealth, but in reality
(writer thinks) to add to the fields, which have been fad-
ing away to poor proportions lately. Surely there’s
enough of the cronk element at pony meetings without
again letting loose those who have been very properly
squelched for their misdeeds.
• • * *
Somewhat remarkable that The Bride has won
Sandhurst Cup and been third in Bendigo Handicap last
two years.
* * * *
pertain Melbourne sporting sheets, which re-
ceive big revenues from bookies’ advts., have been ascrib-
mg’ the fact that Mr. John Crozier, S.A.’s biggest racing
man, has transferred his stable to Melbourne trainer
Brewer, to the evil results of the totalisator. Mr. O. is
one of Adelaide’s many staunch supporters of the
machine, and indignantly denies that the tote has
anything to do with the change. Whilst the S.A.
clubs are all wealthy and have improved the sport
in every way, certain owners, Mr. Crozier amongst the
number, have all along complained that the stakes might
fairly be increased, and that is to be done. Moreover,
Crozier, who is a wealthy man, is merely extending his
operations to Melb. and will still race in Adelaide.

The Australian champion sire, Bill of Portland,
brought 4900 guineas at the recent St. Albans’ sale. He
returns to England in charge of E. Day.

What a paradise for the Sydney gimleteer
would be Warrnambool (Vic.) 1 A local owner of a stallion
was lately fined ss. for “ not observing sufficient pri-
vacy.’; The animal was in a yard surrounded by a hedge
Bft. high and 4ft. thick, but it seems there was a small
gap in the hedge.
* * * *
The one S.A. club which really deals generously
with owners is the Onkaparinga Club, although it races
but once a year—on Easter Monday. It is the boss one-
uay meeting of Australia. This year the club dispenses
£2700, of which £llOO goes in the Steeple, and £5OO each
for Cup and Hurdles. Last year the club received £l7OO
in tote commissions alone, a strong argument for the
machine.

The news that a Rockhampton wood-carter had
drawn Clean Sweep in a “ Tatfc’s ” consultation drew all
the mining and land sharks in Rockhampton round the
lucky' one. “ I’ve got a splendid thing for vou, my boy,”
said one ; “ return you 20 per cent.” “ Don’t listen to
him, ’ whispered another; “ 1 bought 5000 shares in the
1 Swindleeat/ specially for you, guaranteed to double
your capital in three weeks.” “Come and have a bottle
of beer,” said a third, the most astute of the lot. “ Look
here,” he said, while they drank, “ if you listen to them,
they’ll have you stone-broke inside a month; I know
’em. It’s lucky you've got me to look alter you. What
you want to do is to hand me a cheque for, say, £5OOO, to
invest for you,” and he ordered another bottle. “ Well,"
said the wood-carter, “ I was advising me brother ."
“ What’s your brother got to do with it ? ” burst in the
shark. “Him? Why, it’s him that won the stuff.”

Mr. Tom Muir (the N.S.W. turfman) now at
’Ome with Parthian, the Tola, Sweetheart and Fifeshire,
writes that the Yankee method of riding in short stirrups
and bending along the nag’s neck is much ahead of ours.
All the successful English jocks last season (bar S. Loates)
were those who adopted the American system. This is
borne out by Oapt. Scott.
* * * *
Chesney and Australian Star, when last heard
of in England, were being raced —“ unfit ” and un-
backed—to get them “ acclimatised,” and local sporting
scribes were remarking that the acclimatisation could be
just as well conducted in private as in public. Note-
worthy that none of the exported Australian horses have
gone into the handsof those trainers and owners who would
oonsider them frauds upon the public unless they were
racing with a reasonable chance of success. “ Clever ”
tactics are the rule among English owners nowadays, but
there are still a few wealthy sports of the Rosebery type,
racing for excitement rather than boodle, and to whom
Colors-up means Honor-up.

The Austral was won for the first time by a
Maorilander, A. C. Forbes, on his Red Bird bicycle.
The time, 4min. 19 3-ssec., is a world’s record. Forbes
was the only Red Bird rider in the race.
« . * * *
Mem. for cycle riders :—A. C. Forbes, the
Austral winner, rode Dunlop tyres.
The recent investigation (by Parliamen-
tary committee) into tire Cambooya (South Q.)
election scandal disclosed a pretty state of things.
According to the committee’s finding, no less than
58 names of alleged freeholders were placed on the
electoral roll—the freehold in each case being non-
existent. The committee further found that these
names were placed on the roll by false statements,
and in some cases ,by forged signatures. Of 21
men examined whose names appeared on the roll
not one had a valid claim. Twelve out of the 21
declared that they did not sign the claims when
lodged, and that they did not actually know they
were on the roll till they were asked to vote. To
make matters worse, out of the 58 claims
lodged and illegally admitted as freeholds
51 disappeared out of the Pittsworth Court-house
mysteriously in the night time. Further, the
Committee found that a certain M.L.A. had been
guilty of serious hanky-panky in the matter of
filling up certain claims—a matter to be shortly
dealt with in a Court of Justice. A member of
the Committee (a Philpite, by the way) pertin-
ently inquires if this state of things is typical,
and suggests a drastic investigation into the con-
dition of electoral rolls throughout Queensland —
by way, of course, of ascertaining definitely if any
more of the Pliilp party won their seats by similar
dodgery. But the public of Bananaland has seen
so many outrageous political scandals crop up in
the last ten years that it smiles peacefully, and
turns over and goes calmly to sleep again.

situated 50 KING STREET, and near the General Post
Office.
Proprietor - - GEO. W. ELLIS.
One day last week Evening News ex-edi-
tor Hogue, now of Macquarie-st., spread himself
in Sydney D.T. as to whether Lyne, Barton or
Dry-Dog Reid had the best risdit to be appointed
Federal Premier, and after a little circumlocution
decided that the last was the only possible man.
Jimmy started out with the idea that there is no
other State but N.S.W. in the Federation. The
Commonwealth is composed of N.S.W., which has
federated by itself. Men from Victoria, Queens-
land (the much-talked-of “ natural ally ”), South
Australia, Tasmania, and Westralia have no part
in the show—they are not eligible for office. All
Australia must take its choice from Lyne,
Barton, and Reid, regardless of their fitness or
unfitness. And of the three Jimmy Hogue natur-
ally selects the man who made him a Minister.
Gratitude is a noble thing.
Police-Magistrate Pan ton granted hawkers’
licences recently on the annual licensing-day in
Melbourne to 122 Europeans, 29 Chinamen, 103
Syrians (mostly named Haddad and Malouf), and
256 Hindoos (principally described as Ram some-
thing-or-other). Only two applicants were re-
fused—both Syrians who didn’t understand Eng-
lish. One of them knew so little of the language
that he asked the court for a long beer; appar-
ently some humorist had told him that that was
the name of the thing he required, and he knew
no better. Considering what an evil name the
Hindoo has got as a bully who insults and
threatens lone women in bush homes to make them
buy his gaily-colored trash at outrageous prices,
it seems about time that the oily hawking vagabond
was thrown out of the business bodily by legisla-
tion ; 256 of Ram Chunder and Ram Bukh and
Ram Dass is too much.
Hobart (Tas.) papers mention the death of
Nellie Pretoria John, aged four month*. Four
months was a long time for such a small girl to
bear up against such a name.
When Cecil Rhodes began sitting for his
portrait to Fildes, R.A., he wanted his way about
position and attitude; but as the artist was quite
the would-be autocrat’s match in backbone, the
commission was speedily off—Fildes thus sacrific-
ing 500 gs. in preference to his notion of the artis-
tic fitness of things. The result was that when
Rhodes later on sat to W. E. A. Ward, he
accepted the artist’s suggestions just as if he were
an ordinary citizen instead of the King of S Africa.
The portrait was a success, but _ the Royal
Academy people would have none of it. ‘We d
hang Rhodes himself with pleasure,” they wrote—
“ but not his portrait! ”
No sooner had Victorian Assembly passed
the Woman’s Suffrage Bill for the sixth time by a
huge majority than the Argus, the organ of the
obstructive House of 48 Rich Landlords, rose to
assure the public that its Property-elected
Chamber must again do its duty and throw the
measure out. At the late Assembly elections the
people returned 72 members pledged to support
woman suffrage : —this out of a House of 95. When
Turner formed his new Cabinet the two salaried
Ministers in the Leg. Council went before their
constituents —the Leg. Council’s constituents —on
Turner’s Woman’s Suffrage programme, and were
re-elected by huge majorities. And the Argus
rises just as usual to say that people don’t want
Woman Suffrage, and that “ the division in the
Assembly ” (in favour of the Bill) “ was about in
inverse proportion to the state of opinion in the
constituencies.”
At Poverty Point.
Adelaide Critic says “ Tub Bulletin is the only
Sydney journal that finds ought to praise in M‘Kee
Rankin’s Macbeth, and it only adopts that line out of sheer
cussedness.” Ye gods ! Rankin was the man who rose
in rebellion against the stodgy theory that a king must
necessarily be a tall, slim man, always young, and with a
fine, large, beautiful voice, and two long and elegant
legs. He pointed out in a practical fashion that an
elderly, fat, lumbersome butcher-like usurper who spoke
with a thick utterance like one with a mouth full of wheat,
was quite as probable as any other kind. He biffed the
weary, dreadful monarch-tradition in the eye—the tradi-
tion which holds that a monarch never shambles on his
legs, or whistles his words through the site of a missing
front tooth, or looks common or ridiculous in any way,
or grows old, or bulges out in his later years. If past
monarchs were anything like present monarehs then
M‘Kee Rankin is the most probable Macbeth up to date.
He didn’t look as the modem Jingo says a king looks ;
he looked rather like what the average king does look
like, barring the fact that the average king often looks a
lot worse.
Press-people were invited to a private view of panto,
finery at the Princess’s last Thursday. This Yankee
notion of working a newspaper guarantee as to the high
quality of the silks, satins, embroideries and general
fixings recalls to mind the first Australian production of
Mrs. Cora Potter, when the managerial ad. concentrated
all its force on the fact that the fair stranger’s costumes
had been specially manufactured by Worth of Paris. The
public are caught, not by the cold costliness of spectacular
effects, hut by their beauty as viewed in the stagelight.
Costumes to all intents and purposes are scenery.
Managers don’t invite close inspection of back-cloths.
Musgrove tells of a mint of money invested in clothes
for “Cinderella,” his Xmas attraction. “Alias” was
given a free hand and the resultant plumage comes
straight from Paris ; nothing like it has reached London
yet, says the consignee. Muzzy testifies to 500 imported
costumes, and as many wigs with an expert to dress them
daily ; a £6O cloak for Danseuse Darto, whose terms are
£lOO per week and first-class return passage to Vienna.
Nellie Stewart’s gorgeous mantle is white satin, brocaded
with roses, strewn with raised orange-blossom and ruched
with pale green. A fiery chariot, drawn by four cream
ponies, enshrines 1600 electric lights among its 18,000
glass crystals; 30,000 crystals beautify the staircase.
Three funny men come from London, as well as Elsie
Cook from Daly’s Theatre. The latter is described as “ a
21-year-old widow with wistful brown eyes, rippling
bronze-brown hair, satin skin and dainty features.” Two
years ago “ Cinderella ” to be, the story goes, married
Mr. Byrne, a Dublin solicitor, and left the stage for
domestic bliss in Ireland. Her husband volunteered for
B’African service, went out with the Irish Yeomanry, and
was killed last June. His widow, whose Australian
engagement landmarks her return to theatrical life, has
her baby a" and her mother with her in Melbourne.
Williamson’s forthcoming- venture in Italian opera has
inspired Signora Majeroni to form an Italian class, where
aspirants for the chorus and folks in general can gain at
least a superficial knowledge of the pretty language “ as
she is spoke.” The Signora guarantees reading and cor-
rect pronunciation in one quarter, and her charge of a
guinea for the course of 24 lessons opens the class-room
door to everyone who cares to seize this opportunity for
learning the true turn of the Italian tongue. Up to'now
the first syllable of Cuttica and the second syllable of
Cinquevalli have been carefully mispronounced by nine
out of ten of the Melbourne up-to-date people who
consider themselves educated.
“ Cockaigne ” : The glory and pride of the Hawtrey
Family, is the famous Dr. Hawtrey, headmaster of Eton
in the last generation, the Sir Eedmond Barry, or
Turveydrop, of pedagogues.
Williamson evidently had his eye on Nance O’Neil long
before her Australian advent, and even cabled for points
to Musgrove when Nance was showing under adverse cir-
cumstances in London.
Williamson Opera Co. is being run a good deal like a
seminary for the cultivation of musical and dramatic
ability in young ladies of promise. During the last
month or so of the Melb. season half the girls in
the chorus have had a look-in, also several of the young
men who come on in the melodious ruck. Of the girls i t
may be said that they are invariably rather nice and
moderately good, but the vitality, originality, freshness—
the promise of a new Nellie Stewart—is not in them. Mel-
bourne produces scores of pretty good comic-opera girls ;
one would be glad to have the qualities that go to make
half a hundred of them compressed into one leading
lady with real grit and grip.
Nellie Stewart’s divorce care nullified her attractions for
the time-being, or, anyway, discounted them sufficiently
to make them of no avail in a flimsy opera produced at the
dullest time of the year. One never knows which way
the public is going to jump in such matters. Perhaps
Nellie was too old a favorite to be advantageously adver-
tised by a divorce suit.
When Musgrove was putting up “ The Scarlet Feather ”
in London, he cast about for something very special in
the form of an advt.—something that would quite startle
the town. He finally hit upon a glittering idea for a
poster, and gave his special picture-builder an order for
a mighty sheet containing nothing but a gigantic red
feather. The expensive poster was produced and hung
upon the outer walls, and Muzzy sat in his office and
waited for the sensation to come along. “ Everybody
will be asking what it means,” he said. “It will set
people talking and the opera will score a success if only
on the strength of popular curiosity.” Unfortunately no
curiosity arose ; nobody was puzzled, because one and all
concluded that the poster was an advt. for a great
chrysanthemum-show then running in London, and the
flower exhibition boomed amazingly at G.M.’s expense.
Muzzy does not now consider that poster a feather in his
cap.
Melb. musical people will be glad to hear that Phil
Langdale, the bassoonist of the boom times, and of subse-
quent times that didn’t boom, is now doing better than
ever in Londort. He has established a bassoon quartet
whereof London Sunday Times says “ The credit for in-
venting it is due to Mr. Philip Langdale, who takes a
treble part in the quartet. The effect is quite beautiful.
But inasmuch as the bassoon is the clown of the orchestra,
it was naturally in their humorous piece that these
players achieved their most striking success. Their ex
ceedingly quaint and clever performance of a little skit,
‘ The Gentle Lark,’ evoked quite as much laughter as
applause.” Langdale seems to have been the first man to
discover an individual soul in the instrument he plays so
cunningly.
At Brussels Opera House, where Lalla Miranda is now
an established star, the grand opera season covers eight
months of the year. The Australian prima donna made
her debut last year with public feeling against her, for it
happened just at the time when the Brussels public was
saying nasty things about the Australian contingents in
S’Africa. Nobody gave the newcomer a “ hand ” on her
first appearance, but at the end of the act she’d “ got ’em
dead,” and was re-called several times.
“ Edson ” : Oh, the long, slow torture of that venerable
female, “ The Bohemian Girl ” I What a shocking chest-
nut of an opera it is ! —stupid, soggy, middle-class ! Much
of the charm that was in Balfe’s work when it first para-
lysed the lovers of cheap art has long since been ground
out by the barrel-organs, and now, between hackneyed
songs that owe their success largely to their popular
appeal, the cavernous dullness of the thing yawns like
the fiend of desolation. Yet the people rushed the recent
Princess performances, and crowded the theatre every
time. There was some consolation in noting, however,
that these were the oldest audiences seen in a Melb.
theatre for years ; grey heads and bald ones gave quite a
foreign atmosphere to the house, and the limits of the
rather narrow iron-barred seats were severely taxed by
the extraordinary sitting area covered by the representa-
tives of a passing generation. Why not rescue poor
Balfe, who had something of genius, from the foul literary
clutches of Bunn, the monster of dullness who supplied
his libretti ?
The Woods-Williamson Co. open at Ballarat on Boxing
Night in “ Boy Tom,” an adaptation of Conan Doyle’s
novel, the sensation scene being a fight for the light-
weight championship of the world between Alf. Woods
and Tim Hegarty. Each man is knocked down during
the contest, but finally hero Woods puts the pro. to sleep
in a dramatic sense, and the referee counts him out.
“ Boy Tom ” will be followed on New Year’s Night by
“ Barabbas.”
A Melbourne weekly paper informs its readers “authori-
tatively ye gods ! —that a certain actress wears nothing
underneath her tights ; and that in the case of a married
lady “ there is no sign of a baby yet.” Same paper was
lately denouncing the “ gutter press of America.”
Miss Leonore Orelli has been engaged to play the Fairy
Queen in Musgrove’s panto, at the Princess’s.' Miss O. is
the yellow-haired Melb. girl (Swiss-Italian on the paternal
side) who fairy-queened in “ Djin-Djin ” five years ago,
since when she has not appeared on the stage. Her well-
trained voice has developed meanwhile, and she sings
charmingly. The wonder is that G.M. didn’t give the
seldom-heard warbler a chance to figure as Arline, in
“Bohemian Girl.”
There was a wild and whirling scene in the vestibule of
a Melb. theatre, one night, recently, for which three per-
fect ladies, who had taken a stage-box, were entirely
responsible. The intervals were frequent, and th% ladies
availed themselves of each to hasten out and drink healths
in a hurried and agitated way, resulting from the nume-
rousness of the healths to be drunk and the short time
available for drinking them. From time to time during
the evening weird cries were heard issuing from that box,
and either one perfect lady or the other,held possession
of the attention of the audience throughout the second-
to-last act. There was another rush for refreshments in
the next interval, but, when the ladies came rolling back,
filled with healths and patnotism, the manager coldly
barred the way, and sternly bade them begone. They
refused to be gone, and “ went for ” the manager
en masse. The .manager reinforced himself with
moral precepts and doorkeepers and ushers, and
bravely held the fort pending the arrival of a
large persuasive policeman, and meanwhile the perfect
ladies raised Gehenna, and the theatre was filled with
dust, fur, and unholy objurgations. The big policeman
hastened to the disturbance, and grappled with it like a
man, and the three perfect ladies fought him all over the
shop for a space of 10 min. Then the manager chipped
in, and the two were towing heaps pf recalcitrant female
along a passage when the contestants lost grip of things,
and fell in a chaotic heap, out of which miscellaneous and
mysterious limbs jutted, waving madly in the atmosphere.
Then the dishevelled mass bumped painfully down 14
stairs, and was about to negotiate another flight when
assistance arrived. Two perfect ladies were secured, and
were let off lightly by a patriotic Bench next morning,
after pleading that the jubilation was all “ upon account
of ” their boys coming home from the wars.
An old trick was revived by two Poverty Point
jokists at Christchurch (M.L.) recently. Someone adver-
tised that Stewart, Biz. Manager, wanted 100 dogs at the
theatre by 5.30 that evening. Result, a wilderness of
tykes. Next morning Lohr had a hot time. Someone else
advertised for 100 boys to call at Lohr’s hotel—wanted as
bill-distributors at 10s. a day. A special squad of
police had to be put on to keep the thoroughfare clear.
“ Constance Clyde” on wax-works “While sculpture
and nainting are frankly pagan, a waxworks show, which
tries in a small, meek way to combine both, is invariably
studiously moral. Was particularly struck by this in a
stroll round the entertainment in George-street, Sydney,
the other day. The exhibition largely consists of repre-
sentations showing the different ways in which our ances-
tors were racked and guillotined, and the gentle methods
by which women were rebuked for too much freedom of
speech. There is one wax philanthropist in the show,
and about forty murderers. Nevertheless it makes a bold
attempt to be elevating, as when it reproves a certain
Madame Sappe for trying to remove blotches on her skin
by a too powerful cosmetic, ‘ thus sacrificing her life on
the altar of coquetry.’ There are also several Scripture
scenes. In the Judgment of Solomon the headsman and
the two infant-claimers have evidently bought their
drapery from the same remnant-counter in old Jeru-
salem, but the rather good woman; has got her hair
combed straight, while the bad one sports the gaudy
head-dress of Sin. In the Lord’s Supper all the
guests look very unhappy, probably because there is no
supper, though one of the figures has two water-bottles
in front of him. In the programme it is stated that
‘every figure is a correct likeness,’ though there is no
scriptural record that James, the son of Zebedee, ever had
his photo taken. The only healthy-looking disciple of
the lot is Judas Iscariot. Naturally, the Breelong tragedy
is to the fore, jogging elbows with the Gatton murder in
the next department. A small boy is looking very con-
tentedly from under the bed while his sister is being
methodically tomahawked. As in the next compartment,
the two presumed murderers (each a ‘ correct likeness?’)
is each knifing his victim in exactly the same way the
whole has rather a symmetrical effect.”
War-lecturers Donald Macdonald and Banjo Paterson
met at Dunedin (M.L.). They spoke as brothers-in-arms,
“ Mac ” bombarding until 9, and Banjo until 10.30.
Some of the Melbourne stage hands talk gloomily of a
strike for increased wages. These slaves behind the foot-
lights find it hard to keep a wife and three or four children
on 15s. or 16s. 8d. week.

In one recent week two men living in the

by a railway-tram, while two others, both grocery
assistants, drowned themselves off S. Melb. beach,
each first removing his coat before plunging in
Coincidence or imitation ? &
The Otago Witness (of Dunedin, M.L.),
a sixpenny weekly of unblemished respectability,
in a reaction from Imperial topics has begun to
be severely local. Pictures of any local Billy
.Drown and Jeannie M‘Nab on their wedding-day
are now inserted in the above periodical, while
photos, of stolid, six-roomed houses with the in-
habitants all emptied out of them, and standing
in front with their best clothes on, give satis-
faction at least to the good folks pourtrayed.
-Localism reached its pinnacle the other day when
a photo, of a cow called “Dora’' occupied a pro-
minent place as being the sole survivor of some
2A) horned animals lost in a fire. There were
also pictures of the graves of the less fortunate
bovines being filled in, though the minister who
read the se.rvice seems to have been omitted,
lhey take these little accidents in a verra serious
spirit in Otago.

“Federal Freetrader ” to The Bulletin:
A quiet little meeting was held in the Equitable Hall,
Sydney, on Monday evening, for the purpose of forming
the N.S.W. Freetrade Federal Electoral Committee. The
press was carefully excluded. A committee was formed,
consisting principally of well-known “ political hacks ”
including G. H. Reid, Pulsford, Mary Jane Gould, Pump-
kin Smith, Jemmy Hogue and M‘Lean—nearly every
one of whom is an aspirant for Federal honors.
The anti-Bill element was so strongly in evidence,
that people will wonder if Barton and Wise’s cry of “ The
Commonwealth in danger ” may not have something in
it after all. The N.S.W. division of the Freetrade and
Liberal Association, which had to do all the work of or-
ganising and finding funds, was severely snuffed out at
the Electoral Meeting. The only members who seemed
to be in the swim were F. E. M'Lean, M.L.A., the secre-
tary or treasurer of every thing to which ad vt. is hanging, and
Pulsford, M.L.0., the “ Weary Willie” of Freetrade, who
is after a seat in the Senate. B. R. Wise was nominated
for a seat on the Freetrade Electoral Committee, but
the chairman’s hearing became suddenly very bad.
“ Jimmy ” Hogue’s name was missed, but Dry-
Dog Reid suddenly remembered that he had
been nominated. “ Oh, yes !he had his name down.”
After the Freetrade Electoral Committee had been
“ selected,” Dry Dog inadvertently referred to them as
“ his ticks,” an admission received by a portion of the
meeting with screams of laughter. Will the Freetrade
anti-Bill Electoral Committee, representative of nobody
but the little political clique who scratch each otheFs
backs, be able to delude the public into the belief that it
is a genuine representative body ?
The “ Souvenir of the Inauguration of
the Australian Commonwealth,” published by
A. C. Rowlandson, proprietor of N.S.W. Book-
stall Co., and printed by John Sands, is a most
interesting publication for the multitude. In its
40 pages, Bulletin size, it has portraits of all the
leading men who have been connected with
Federation ; a historical sketch of the movement,
a Federation ode, and many other things. The
price is Is.*

When the Woman’s Suffrage Bill came before
Vic. Assembly the other day for the sixth time
the Gillies crowd waded in once more to tell how-
the home would be ruined and broken up, and the
dinner spoiled, and the baby burned alive,
through the house-mother going out for a few
minutes once in three years or so to record her
vote. And yet many of these silly old men hold
that it is her duty to go out 52 or 104 times a year
to church and let the baby fry.

Printed that “ the Roman Catholics of
Tungamah (Vic.) district are so dissatisfied with
the present state of the Coningham divorce case,
that they are willing to subscribe towards helping
the petitioner to bring on a new trial.” Before
proceeding anew petitioner would presumably
have to give heavy security for costs.. Co-
respondent’s taxed costs in the Coningham case
would, no doubt, make a very big hole in £lOOO.
The Benevolent Societies’ Fete—one of the
features of the approaching Commonwealth festivities —
should command the ready support of all. The object is
good, the price of tickets, Is., is reasonable, and the enter-

Hall and a monster sports meeting at the Agricultural
grounds—will appeal to all classes. Further particulars

The sapient new-chum who runs the
Sydney Morning Herald dog-column continues
gravely to allow his innocent leg to be pulled by
the mad wag who calls himself “E. Henry
Thompson, F.G.S.” IJnillumined by even the
Centralian “marsupial dog” yarn, the guileless
Herald expert has now taken on a fearsome
tale of how two out of a party of seven Gippsland
miners were slain and devoured by dingoes, which
left of their victims “ nothing but a few scraps of
clothing and some of the larger bones.jH
Tobacco Co., of N.S.W., has issued a neat

Ever since Roberts’ Hotel, at the corner
of George and Market streets, was first established,
now some 35 years ago, it has been noted as one
of the best in N.S. Wales, and deservedly so. The
well-known bottle department contains every
liquor that can warm the heart of man and gladden
his spirit, and the prices are arranged to suit
everybody’s pocket. The stock comprises the wines
of all countries and every brand of spirits. Every
article is of uniform excellence, and all orders,
large or small, are delivered to any part of the
city and suburbs. The dining-room on the first
floor, where meals can be had at a most reasonable
cost, is extensively patronised, while the hotel
accommodation for visitors is of the best.*

From Brisbane :
Mr. H. Ohatterton, superintendent of the Mitchell
District Board, Queensland, has arrived at Charleville
from a three months’ trip to the S. W. district. Mr. Chat-
terbon reports that during a 500-miles journey he did not
see 300 cattle alive ; the country is devastated from the
south-western corner of the province to about 12 miles
east of the Diamantina. In one waterhole on a station
Mr. Ohatterton states that he saw 1500 dead cattle,
and in another 700 were lying dead. When passing
through Birdsville it was impossible to buy either fresh or
tinned meats. Owing to the drought no horse or bullock
team had been to the township for over four years. Mr.
Chattert-on declares that unless Govt, helps the squatters
the whole of the south-western corner of the State will be
thrown back on its hands.
S.A. candidates for the Federal Parliament
will probably be: —Senate (6), ex-Premier Play-
ford, ex-Premier Downer, President Baker,
M.L.C., Kirkpatrick, M.L.C. (Labor), M'Greg-
gor, M.L.C. (Labor), Charleston, M.L.C., Parsons,
editor Bonython, Darling, M.P. (ex-President
Chamber of Commerce), Muecke (German Con-
sul), Federal delegate Howe, M.L.C., and ex-
Chief Secretary O’Loghlin, M.L.C. House of
Representatives (7), Privy Councillor Kingston,
Premier Holder, M.P., Opposition Leader Solo-
mon, M.P., Labor leader Price, M.P. (Labor),
Education-Minister Batchelor, M.P. (Labor),
Nesbit, Q.C., Symon, Q.C., Grainger, M.P..
Burgoyne, M.P., John Gordon (a leading mer-
chant), Glynn, M.P., and Lieutenant E. A.
Roberts, M.P. (now on his way from S’Africa).
The Charters Towers’ clergy have risen in
wrath to denounce Dunsford, local Labor M.L.A.
for his breach (as exposed in recent Divorce Court
proceedings) of the seventh commandmant.
Dunsford was not guilty of the sin of
breaking up any man’s domestic peace, for the
domestic peace (according to evidence) had
been broken up long before. No accusation
of violated youthful innocence could be hurled
against him and the respondent (as per
evidence) was probably a greater sinner. than
the enamoured legislator. But the Towers’ clergy
who have never yet dared to lift up a voice against
the scandalous public jobs daily transacted under
the Philpocracy —the Towers’ clergy, who played
dumb dog when the country was a prey to rotten
finance and back-door boodling, have discovered
suddenly that Dunsford (politically a very straight
man) isn’t fit to sit in the same Assembly with
Q. N. B. overdrafters, syndicate-tools, and so
forth. Hypocrisy—thy name is parson !

“One of the daintiest dazzlers now on the
boards is the daughter of an Army lassie. Her
first essay at singing to an audience was made
under the Salvation flag to the accompaniment of
the big drum.
“A very dignified widow spends a sunny
afternoon basking on the grassy slope of the
Botanical Garden, in the company of an affinity
(masculine be it said) while together they feed
swans. Sweet idyll of middle age !
“A startling answer was made by an earnest
Melbourne clergyman, who has lately been pro-
minently before the public, to a lady in his parish.
She told him that since she had lived there he had
never paid her a visit. ‘ Madame,’ said the re-
verend longshanks, ‘ I never pay any visits in my
parish, except to sick people, and to houses of ill-
fame ! ’ She gasped.
“A well-known member of Society is afflicted
with the awful complaint of kleptomania, so that
visitors to her hospitable house take the precau-
tion (being twice shy) to carry their purses about
with them. If an absent-minded beggar leaves
hers on the dressing-table, the maid quietly pre-
sents it to her with a meaning look. _ The light-
fingered lady, who carries things off with a dash-
ing insolence, is under the surveillance of her
friends wherever she goes, but pretends to know
or see nothing. She is an opportunist with an
extraordinary wit for seizing her chances. But
some people are not nice as to terms, and call the
matron uglier names than an absent-minded beggar
and a kleptomaniac.
“One of the Melb. members of the late Vic.
Parliament, lately a candidate for re-election,
shows himself in his positively most absurd light
when he writes to his —ah —medical attendant.
With all the pomp and circumstance of Parlia-
ment-House note-paper and large red seal, he
desires the doctor to visit Mrs. Blank (the poli-
tician’s wife) without delay. Mrs. Blank is a
terror for being indisposed, and, judging from the
frequency and the majesty of these letters to the
medico, one would suppose that Blank, M.L.A.,
was a fine lucrative patron to have on the books.
As a matter of fact, he and the missus get their
doctoring on the ‘ Lodge ’ ticket. Fourteen ‘ bob ’
per annum.
‘ ‘ Talking of which recalls the case of the one-
time Victorian Premier who ran up a considerable
doctor’s bill, and was virtuously indignant when
it came to hand. Being pressed for payment, he
assumed his casual character of high cockalorum
to a certain lodge, and declared himself on
the lodge whereof his physician was the contract-
ing cure-all. The plan didn’t work, however.
The disgusted doctor took out a summons, and
the political personage, who was wanting to get
away on a long trip, and couldn’t afford to cut a
contemptible figure in the newspapers at that
moment, paid the account and dropped a tear on
the receipt.
“Mr. Justice Hood is as good a Judge to get
divorced by as there is on the Victorian bench.
He looks a very stern and angry man, but they
say he is very nice indeed when you know him
and don’t rub him against the nap. The best of
him as a divorcer is that he does it quickly, with-
out fuss, and preaches no sermon about it. It
must be a hideous ordeal to be divorced by Mad-
den, C. J. He is always pretending to be horri-
fied, when one knows that as a man of the world
he is not horrified a bit, and he will persist in

no sort of good. Mr. Judge A’Beckett is a
cynical old man, and divorces you with his tongue
in his cheek. Mr. Justice Williams is very easy,
but looks so bored about the business. If you are
to be divorced you like a Judge to take a sort of
interest in your case. Mr. Justice Holroyd is
simply a dry lawyer with a calf-bound heart,
divided up into caps, sections and sub-sections in-
stead of valves and veins. He cares no more for
a romantic divorce-case than for disputes about
torts and equities. No, on the whole, Hood is the
best divorcer—short, sharp and decisive.
“What are song-names coming to? In their
hour ‘Only an Ivy-leaf’ and ‘Only a Pansy-

descriptive than that title of to-day, ‘ Only a
Leaf’ —kind of leaf not specified. However, I
may tell you that it’s only the leaf of a bible, not
of a cabbage. Song goes on to explain that ‘ the
girl who was to have been my wife ’ had owned
the sacred leaf. Can the loved, lost one have ex-
ploited the Good Book for a curl-paper ?
“ In former times young men seem to have been

drop one in Borneo’s path. Don’t sneer at femi-

NEVER FREE FROM PAIN
Till the Panacea was bought
Which soon restored his health.
The Oaiee of
MR. C. J. LENTON.
(by our reporter.)
Our reporter was specially commissioned
to take a journey to Redfern and find out
if the information received about Mr.
Lenton’s sufferings from neuralgia, and
subsequent cure by Clements Tonic, were
exactedly as had been stated, and on alight-
ing from the tram he walked down Elizabeth-
street until he reached No. 30, where, upon
entering, he was met by Mr. Lenton, who
good naturedly commenced a conversation
on the subject of his neuralgic troubles.
“I can trace the origin of my neuralgia to
a cricket match in which I took part on the
Redfern Park, between eight and nine years
ago. I have good cause to remember the
occasion. It was on a Queen’s Birthday,
and a dreadful day it was for playing
cricket. The weather was bitterly cold, and
we were running about and standing at
intervals in the mud. My feet got wet, and
I sustained a severe chill into the bargain
Those were the days when I was a member ;
of the Surrey United Cricket Club, which I'■
belonged to for about sixteen years, and had $
the honour of acting as captain and secretary
for a portion of that time. But the majority
of young fellows never think of the risks
they run of catching various complaints
when a game of cricket is at stake, and I
suppose I was like the rest of them. Those *
trophies you see over there represent many '
a happy hour on the cricket-field; but I !
have spent many a painful one indoors
through playing.”
“Were you attacked suddenly?”
“Yes; it did not take very long to|
develop, and there was no chance of mis-f
taking it for toothache, the pains being so \
acute that they would dart through my head >
with agonising persistence. If ever there
was a brief lull in the torturing shafts that
I was a victim to, there was always a dull
headache instead. I was never free from.,
pain, and my jaws became so badly affected!
that I could not eat with any degree of
freedom. That did not prove a great hard-
ship, because I was always afraid of eating
in case it might start the neuralgia at work
again. On retiring to bed at night I would
hoodwink myself into the belief that sleep
would drive the enemy away; but to my
utter disappointment and dismay there was
very little rest for me, and I would harness
myself up for business in the mornings with
great reluctance, feeling tired, weak, and
miserable. My face was a good index as to
my condition, for it became haggard and
drawn, and bore the imprint of torture on
every outline. I had always been a strong,
healthy man, and the way I-was falling off
used to cause me a deal of anxiety. I often -
wished it was toothache instead of neuralgia,
because I would have had every one of them
drawn out, if necessary, to get rid of the
pain. It was only to be expected that
under these trying circumstances it would :
take very little to make me irritable, and I
could not attend to the duties of a superin-
tendent of an infants’ Sunday school with
as much good grace and pleasure as I do
now. As time dragged wretchedly on, the
excruciating pains became worse, and I must
confess that I considered, it was owing to
my teeth getting very bad. I could feel
something forming on the left corner of my
lips, which made mo feel very depressed. I
could not make out what it was, but it
added greatly to my neuralgia pains when-
ever I tried to force myself to eat.”
“Were you making any effort to get rid
of the neuralgia?”
“Well, rather; I gave nearly every
mixture and pill I knew of a trial; but they
proved to be rank failures. Not one of
them gave me relief or ease from pain. I
could have done just as well without them
—in fact, better, because they all cost
money, you know. It is some considerable
time ago now, am not quite sure how
it came about— whether it was through
something I had read or not; but I think an
acquaintance told me Clements Tonic
would cure me, and sure enough it did. I
was m the same state as a drowning man
catching a straw; I had in vain taken so
many alleged remedies, but all were unable
to release me from pain. I found that
Clements Tonic would fix me up after taking
a reasonable course of it, for there was a
marked decrease in my agony when
only a few doses had been taken. I used to
take it as though I was thirsty, knowing
that it was only a question of a little time
when it would put me to rights. As the
pain became less and less I could sleep much
better ; then I had more of a craving for my
food. About the end of the first bottle the
neuralgia was conquered, and the restless,
nervous feeling which had enshrouded my
existence for so long was supplanted by my
usual calm and steady disposition. In due
course I could command a sound night’s
rest, and would get up and enjoy my break-
fast in the morning. Headaches and their
depressing influences were quickly made
strangers to me, and when the third bottle
was placed by the side of its empty
predecessors I was fit to play cricket in the
mud again; although my prudence will deter
me from running the risk of a repetition of
my suffering.”
“Have you been free from neuralgia ever
since?”
“I am thankful to say that I have ; but
the growth under the tooth which I have
previously referred to was a cancer, and last
Christmas I had it cut out. I spent the
whole of that day in bed, so you may
depend I did not enjoy myself. The
operation was very trying to my strength,
but a bottle of Clements Tonic soon brought
back my energy, and all that remains of the
cancer now is a feeling as though a plaster
of ice was put on the side of my face when I
go out into the cold. I can honestly say
that Clements Tonic performed a radical
cure of my neuralgia, and I may also state
that when one of my sisters was almost
paralysed through a domestic affliction
which occurred, it was with the same
remedy that we brought her round. My
vife has every reason to speak in the
lighest terms of its wonderful strengthening
attributes, for she is indebted to Clements
l.’onic for bringing back her strength after a
•serious mishap. When anything goes
wrong in the way of sickness it is the first
thing we go for. We have so much faith
in its reliability. I have lived in Redfern
and W aterloo for about thirty-five years
altogether, and you may guess I am very
well-known.”
“Can we publish the opinion you so
candidly express?”
“Certainly you can; and you may publish
over the country as you desire.”
STATUTORY DECLARATION.

Publication of all the nauseous details about
the First Gentleman in Europe and Lady

In &11 wars the commissioned ranks suffer
more than the . non-commissioned. They are
necessarily more conspicuous. In close, obstinate
hand-to-hand fighting they suffer especially, and
the loss of officers is in inverse ratio to the fight-
ing qualities of the soldiers. In the Franco-
German war there was much close and desperate
hand-to-hand fighting, and many pitched battles.
Thus the losses in battle, 6'55 per cent. of. officers
to 3'09 men—about 2to I—is not more than might
be expected. In S’Africa, on the other hand,
there has been practically no hand-to-hand fight-
ing, therefore the British loss of officers—7’2l per
cent, to I'9 per cent, of others—shows there was a
screw loose somewhere.

Beanie’s Bronchitis Cure.
TZEaCIES FAMOUS REMEDY FOR
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, AND CONSUMPTION,
HAS THE LARGEST SALE OF ANY CHEST MEDICINE IN AUSTRALIA.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain or
Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a Complete Cure. It is most com-
forting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has
never been known to exist where “ Coughs " have been properly treated with this medicine. No house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a Complete Cure is certain.'

Mr. W. G. Hearne.—Dear Sir,—Lam writing to tell-you
about, the wonderful cure your medicine has effected in
my case. About three years ago I_began to cough. _At
first the cough was not severe,but it gradually got worse,
and I became very weak and troubled with .night sweats,
pain in my chest, and great quantities of phlegm. On
several occasions there was blood in the expectorated
matter. I had been treated by a doctor, who pronounced
my ease to be Consumption, and various other treatments
had been tried, but without benefit. It was at this stage
that I heard of yOur Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for
a course of the medicine. When it arrived I was too ill to
leave my bed, but I commenced taking it at once, and
gradually improved. lam glad to say that the two lots
of medicine you sent have effected a complete cure, for
which accept my very, best thanks.—Yours gratefully,
J. BLAIR.

very much eased at once. At the end of a week I only
took it twice a day, and then only every night fora
week, as I was so much better when, thanks to the Lord
for adding His blessing, I was quite well, and walked into
town and back without feeling any fatigue. I had not
done that, previously for 12 months—always went in the
omnibus —as walking caused me such pain and distress in

Extract from a letter, since written by the same lady to
her son, Hr. John S. Mortimer, Lien welly n, Katunga,
Victoria.
HER DAUGHTER HAD BEEN VERY ILL.
SPITTING UP BLOOD.
THE DOCTOR SAID NOTHING MORE COULD BE
DONE.
CURED BY HE ARNES BRONCHITIS CURE.
The extract runs as follows :—“ As for myself, thank
the Lord, lam feeling stronger than I have for years. I
had an attack of Bronchitis in November, but Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure was again successful. I feel quite well,
and walk into town feeling quite strong.
“ I must ask you to send me six bottles more of the
medicine, as I wish to have a supply in the house. I
have tried to get it made up here, and let my chemist
have a bottle to see what he could do. He tells me this
week he can make nothing out of it, he never saw any-
thing like it before, so there is only one thing for me to
do —send for more. I have never kept in bed one day
since I commenced to take it. I used to be in bed a fort-
night at a time always, and after that for months I was
as weak as I could possibly be, and was always taking
cod liver oil, so you will see at once it is quite worth
while sending for it such a long distance.
“ Something more I must tell you. Charlotte has been
very ill since I wrote you. Her cough was so bad she
never had a night’s rest, and was spitting up blood
very much. The doctor told her husband that there was
nothing more he could do for her. So on the Sunday I
sent her half a bottle of the Bronchitis Cure, and told
her to try it, and if shedidhotuse.it, not to waste it,
but send it back again. She had such confidence in her
doctor that I thought she would not try it: On the
Wednesday I sent oyer again, and she was much better,
the night’s rest was very good, and cough and bleeding
from the lungs better. She sent for another half-bottle,
and on the following Sunday sent over to say that she
was quite cured and did not require any more medicine.
So you see what great good it has done, and she wishes
to have some of my next supply.”

a most distressing, suffocating, dry cough that could not
be removed or even eased by any remedy, doctors’
prescriptions and patent medicines having been tried ;

and difficulty of breathing, etc., were entirely removed by
the fifth dose of .your Bronchitis Cure. —I remain, Sir,

COMPLETELY CURED.
“ Mr. W. G. Hearne.
“ Dear Sir, —Your medicine has cured me of bronchitis
and asthma, from which I suffered for upwards of seven
years, during which period I was scarcely ever free from
coughs, and frequently the difficulty of breathing was so
distressing that for nights in succession I had to sit up.
I write you this acknowledgment from a sense of duty, as
in my case every other treatment had failed. For a year
previous I had been getting very much worse, and at the
time I obtained your medicine I was confined to bed
suffering from a most violent cough, expectorating blood
and matter, and apparently beyond hope of recovery.
The first dose of the medicine gave me welcome relief,
and I steadily improved as I continued the treatment,
until I became, as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely,
H. WALKER, Balmain, Sydney.”

medicine for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this
medicine I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then,
which was in the beginning of 1883— 15 years ago—l have
not had the slightest return of it. The medicine quile
cured me, and I have much pleasure in recommending if.”

The possibility of an accouchement in court so

author of “ The Angel in the House,” and for 20
years assistant librarian of the British Museum
(we had in Australia a brother of his, Gurney
Patmore, who edited a paper at Portland, Vic.,
in the long ago), contains some curious bits.
Coventry Patmore was a man who fancied him-
self. “I am,” said he, “the only poet of this
generation, except Barnes ” (a vernacular poet
uncomprehended of the multitude), “ who has
steadily maintained a literary conscience.” Pat-
more was very free in his description of his
friends. He once went to see Leigh Hunt:
Arriving at his house, a very small one in a small square
somewhere in the extreme west, I was informed that the
poet was at home, and asked to sit down till he came to
me. This he did, after I had waited in the little parlor
at least two hours, when the door was opened, and amost
picturesque gentleman, with hair flowing nearly or quite
to his shoulders, a beautiful velvet coat, and a Vandyke
collar of lace about a foot deep, appeared, rubbing lus
hands, and smiling ethereally, and saying without a word
of preface or notice for my having waited so long, This
is a beautiful world, Mr. Patmore.” I was so struck with
this remark that it has eclipsed all memory of what
occurred during the remainder of my visit.
Patmore said that Tennyson made a hideous mis-
take in publishing “Maud” and that “probably
no modern work has done so much to undermine
popular religion as ‘ln Memoriam 5 ’’-concerning
which he writes■. .
Tennyson had lodgings up two pairs of stairs m Morn-
insrton Place, Hampstead-road, and I, who was lately
married, lived hard by. We used to dine together two or
three days a week. He liked his port, and did not care
much about its quality. He got his bottle dady from the
nearest public. He often read me bits of ‘ In Memoriam,
then unpublished. After he had left his iodgingfl three
or four weeks I received a letter from where hewas stay-
ing in the country, asking me to go to his old lodging,
and recover the manuscript of “In Memoriam, a long,
thin volume like a butcher’s account-book. Heleft leu
a closet in which he kept his tea and bread and butter
The landlady assured me that no such book had Deen
left there, and objected to my going to see ; but l in-
sisted, and pushing by her ran upstairs and found the
manuscript. Tennyson afterwards gave this volum

A Photograph.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A photograph of a pretty villa stood against a
vase on a mantel-piece. A handsome woman sat
at a window, looking alternately at the photo., the
view and the door—at the last expectantly. When
George Edwards entered, her expectancy gave
way to pleasure unalloyed.
They talked softly, and looked more than they
said ; until it almost cloyed, Then George glanced
carelessly round the room.
“ What a pretty ” —his eye caught the photo.,
and his face reddened with surprise—“little den
this is, Nell! ” She saw the hesitation and the
blush. Being a woman, she rose and handed the
photo, to him.
“It’s my first attempt,” she said; “what do
you think of it?” She watched him closely, -
hoping he would explain what had moved him.
“ You have chosen a rather pretty subject,” he
said. “ What made you take this villa ? ”
“Oh, nothing.”
There Was a silence. Both Were waiting for
confidence as a right, due to their relation with
each other. And both were disappointed. When
they parted, it was with an unasked question in
their glances; when they met again, the question
had changed to an unspoken suspicion, expressed
by a subtle coolness, wherein was an apparent
determination to ask nothing of each other—and
to wait.
They waited months—until they were as mere
acquaintances—until, they had grown cynical.
And, while Nell waited passively for happiness
to come back to her little den, George ultimately
sought it in the pretty villa of the photograph.
* * * *
“ Heliotrope ” was the name of the villa, and a
merry party was there. Men and women, all
young—but the wine was old. There was a piano
at one end of a large drawing-room, at the other
end a table laden with a rich supper. A man,
George Edwards, was playing the piano, thumping
at a comic song, and singing. .The revellers wan-
dered from piano to table, to drink and eat and
sing alternately. There was no trace of the sor-
rowing lover on George’s face, and he sang with
verve and abandon. When the song ended he
looked for his meed of applause, and found a pair
of very bright eyes observing: him quizzically.
“So you’re back again? Why so long away,
dear George ? ” asked the owner thereof.
“I thought I could find prettier women” —he
nearly said .“ better “ than you, Pretty Eyes ;
but I have come back.”
“ Who may she be ? ” asked Pretty Eyes.
“ I said women,” answered George.
“ Don't evade, Sir Galahad. . Why has she
jilted you ? ”
“ There is no evasion. I sought prettier women
and failed.”
Pretty Eyes laughed mirthfully, went to the
piano, began the last verse of a song which ended
with the line—sung with meaning emphasis—
“ How very like a man, said the owl.” He went
and kissed her, but was not so lively for the rest
of the evening, and drank more wine than was
good for his logic. For when Smith kissed'Pretty ;
Eyes in front of the assembled company, George
was amorous enough to resent it by hitting him.
Smith hit back. And they gave the small hours
an exciting turn by fighting to a finish in the
middle of the gaudy drawing-room. The finish
consisted of their tumbling under the piano, and
falling asleep in each other’s arms—drunk.
It was Smith who awakened first, feeling
something punching his ribs. He sleepily turned
and mechanically hit George'. Then he felt a thump
on his back, and turned and found Pretty Eyes
kicking him. ‘‘ Get up, you brute, and go home! ”
He was wide-awake instantly. Daylight was
sneaking through the windows, showing garishly
the disorder of the room, and all the merry sparkle
was gone from the woman’s eye, giving place to a
glitter of contempt. He rose and shambled out,
as ashamed of himself as his muddled head would
let him be.
Then she dropped on her "knees beside the still-
sleeping George, deftly went through his pockets,
taking what loose cash there was, but leaving his
jewellery" intact. Which was business: She
knew he might have to explain the loss of jewel-
lery, and that might keep him away in future.
Gash was different. She also came across an old
letter read it through carelessly, saw it
was signed simply “ Nell.” “ Thought as much !”
she muttered and put it back again. Then, still
kneeling beside him, she looked intently into his
still sleeping face, her own gradually softening.
She brushed the tousled hair from his forehead
with her fingers, very gently ; then straightened-
up still kneeling, and looking at him. She did
not seem to notice him slowly awakening.
Watching through half-closed lids he felt a glow
creep through him. It was a beautiful face. Al s
the rays from the rising sun gleamed in her blue-
black hair, and lighted her dark-blue eyes, it was
even purer than beautiful. But there was another
light in her eyes, not given by the sun ; it was
that which made him thrill. He had seen that
light in the eyes of Nell; but in her there was re-
serve in it, even when it was most intense. Here
it was absolutely unreserved. He had seen it
once in the eyes of a French Mother-Superior,
whose face shone like a star from amidst a number
of others which expressed nottiing but smug reli- .
giosity. And it could be found in the pictures of
the world’s great painters—painters whom the
world honored as its greatest. He never thought
to see it again on earth outside a canvas, where he
thought it but the expression of an ideal from the,
brain of genius. His eyes opened wide with sur-
prise. His surprise broke the light in the face of
the beautiful woman before him, and with a laugh
she was merely Pretty Eyes of the evening before.
“ Look ! ” she said, “it was all I could find.”
She held up the money taken from his pockets.
A bitter taste came into his mouth, which was
not wine-lees, but simply disillusion, disappoint-
ment, and disgust. It seemed as if she were a
nightmare that had wantonly broken into a
glorious vision.
But he had been near to, and had got a
glimpse of, something that all men sought in
woman. And the irony of it !
The few moments of his vision left a permanent
impression. When he recovered from the subse-
quent effects of his spree, he again called on Nell.
She was surprised, in a mild way, to find him
gazing at her As if he sought something. Being
an eminently respectable woman, believing the
sentiments to be deep emotions, and very deep
because they were hers, she thought his mind was
working to a climax in their silent quarrel, and
waited with a proper dignity for his confidence.
He saw the dignity come into her attitude, and
he turned with a smile to the photograph, recog-
nising that it had come between them finally.
Georgete visits to the merry villa became fre-
quent, while his participation in its pleasures
ceased. He was seeking something none of its
inmates understood, not even Pretty Byes, though
she knew he sought it in her.
One day he eame and found her ill. Ha saw
that a sick Bacchante was an incubus, when he
found her stowed away in an untidy back room,
neglected. A great pity surged through him ; for
she was obviously very ill. Noticing Ins pity, she
felt a dim trust in him, and expressed it by crying.
He took her hot hand, and felt the pulse wildly
beating.
“What’s the matter, little one?” he asked,
lamely.
“ I don’t'know. I wish —I wish ! Oh, I don’t
know what I wish.”
“Do you wish to leave this place?”
“And go to the hospital?” she asked quickly,
with a returning suspicion.
“No ; go to the seaside and be nursed.”
“How*an Ido that? I must get up and re-
turn to business.”
“ That business in front ?”
“Of course. I never knew any other. What
are you bothering me for ? ”
George left. In three hours he had taken a
furnished cottage by the sea. In three more the
sick woman was in it, attended by an automaton
whose long bonnet-tails and white cuffs placarded
her “professional nurse,” George then hired an-
other automaton to come and examine her body.
He pronounced pneumonia, gave instructions to.
the nurse, and left with the information, in reply
to George’s question, “ She has a chance.”
George called daily for a fortnight, and was
pleased then to find that she had at last passed
the crisis. Then he began to look for what he
had seen on that morning, but only found that the
coarseness her life had put into her features was
refined away by sickness —and nothing more. She
was still weak, too weak to bother about any-
thing—with just strength enough to sit up
in bed staring at the sea ; merely living ;
once only giving him a look of wondering
gratitude for the unaccustomed kindness, not
realising its extent, and totally ignorant of its
motive. Next day he brought a little girl with
him, a beautiful child of eighteen months. The
invalid looked at it carelessly, then curiously, then
at George with a thoughtful frown. But her face
straightened out blankly.
He brought the child again next day. It toddled
to the bed and looked up at the invalid with wide,
wondering eyes. The woman and the child stared
at each other solemnly for several minutes. Sud-
denly she gave a start and looked at George—and
what he sought was there. The nurse saw the
change and stopped sewing. In seeing, she re-
flected what she saw —it made her a woman, too.
The sunlight poured softly into the room, touch-
ing with gold a golden moment. The doctor
entered silently, and stood still. He, too, felt the
irradiation from the woman’s face. At last the
child’s eyes brightened ; it held up its little arms,
went closer to'the bed, and cried “ Muvver ! ”
She did not seem to hear the child, and tried to
speak, to raise her arms, but failed. Then her
eyes took on an infinite sadness, slowly closed,
then opened. The doctor became a healer in a
moment, the nurse a machine. But Pretty Eyes
was dead.
“Nell! ” said George a fortnight later, “What
do you know about that villa ? ” He nodded to
the photograph.
“Nothing,”she answered. “I took it because
it looked rather pretty.” Then he told her of his
connection with Daphne villa in all its detail,
and saw again the air of maidenly dignity steel
her eyes. Then he told her of his vision of an
ideal, watching her closely, and of the death of
Pretty Eyes. But Nell’s expression remained
steely.
At last he said “ Nell, will you marry me now ? ”
She blushed prettily, looked down at some
needle-work on her knee with a maidenly diffi-
dence she knew was becoming, and said : “ I am
not certain that I can forgive a man so sentimental
—come back in a month apd see.”
She wonders to this day why he never came
back for her pardon.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Where lies the land beloved by all,
In youth, or age, or prime—
The land where pleasures never pall,
A rare and radiant clime ?
’Mid golden gleams, Arcadia’s streams
With a magic music flow ;
The spot of earth that gave us birth
Shines with a gracious glow;
But a lovelier land, more fair and grand,
Is the land of Nirgendswo.
0, a rare land and a dear land is the land we love
and know;
No fairy shore could charm us more than the Land
of Nirgendswo.
This is the land where all resort
Who seek forbidden joys—
The land that’s full of wholesome sport
For healthy girls and boys.
They shirk the school, they break all rule,
They play with eager zest;
They careless roam, nor think of home,
Till warns the reddening West.
“ Where were you ? ” anxious mothers ask,
And “ Nowhere ! ” ends the quest.
0, a wide land and a free land is the land where
the children go,
And hearts are light from morn till night in the
Land of Nirgendswo.
Young men and maids, in later life,
Still to that land repair,
And live apart from worldly strife,
In bliss beyond compare.
“Wherewert thou, daughter?” “Whither,son,
Wouldst bend thy steps to-night ? ”
A graver look the young folks don,
Their eyes become less bright,
And “Nowhere in particular ! ”
Decides the matter quite.
No glory-land of Storyland can half the gladness
show
That youths and maids find in the glades of mystic
Nirgendswo.
E’en Wedlock cannot quench the love
Of Nirgendswo’s delights;
Gay Benedick, by specious trick.
Gets often there o’ nights.
Safe in his club, neglectful “hub’'
Is deaf to Duty’s call;
Vexed nigh to tears, his fond wife hears
At last his footsteps fall.
‘ ‘ Where were you, dear ? ” “Oh, nowhere, love! ”
This answer settles all.
O, light gleams and bright dreams, with Wine
and Friendship’s flow,
Recall Youth’s joys to greybeard boys in the Land
of Nirgendswo.
Old age comes on; this earth grows less,
And Elsewhere larger looms;
There’s still a thought to cheer and bless
Amid the gathering glooms.
Man would not dwell in the mythic hell
Or Heaven the priests have made;
He longs to go to Nirgendswo,
To lie in grateful shade,
Where the sad are blest and the weary rest,
And joys ne’er fail or fade.
A far land and a fair land is the land where the
dead men go;
There is silence deep and soundest sleep in the
Land of Nirgendswo 1*

The Open Road.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
All the nights and days, when I am in houses or
in the city streets, that road calls to me. That
long road that runs between the sea and the bush
summons me. Every branch and leaf and petal
turned towards, me is a beckoning hand, every
petal and branch and leaf turned from me is a
pointing finger showingthe way—“out and away.”
It does not wait for me. It runs for miles, but at
every few strides it seems to turn and look, as if
over its shoulder and still hurrying, and ask, “Is
she coming ? ” Perhaps the backward glance is
across a boulder with lichens on its sunburnt face,
perhaps it is upward from between rocky walls
whither the road has raced down into the green"
dusk of big trees, or it travels up a hill through
a patch of blackened saplings—the trophies of last
summer’s fire. And I can hear it panting, “Is
she coming ? ” And now it loiters and seems to
pause in a green, open space among white camps.
And in the pause it looks round and whispers,
“Is she coming ? I’ll stop till she comes.”'
And, although I am asleep at midnight or walk-
ing at noonday in a roaring street, I answer “ I
am there—always there on the long, wide road,
the long, narrow road, grey-walled by the gum-
trunks, black-flecked by their leaf-shadows.
On the boulder-face I am standing to look sea-
ward and watch the yachts creeping like white
spiders over the blue mantle of the sea. (How
the purple sarsaparilla swings from its sides !) It
was from that coign one evening I saw the sunset
fires dashed out by a cloud-avalanche. One
instant the west was aflame with all the color you
see in jewels and flowers and birds’ wings; the
next it was swarthy, ashen cold. The sea grew
black. Then out of the murky western twilight
came three steamers. They sped forward phan-
tom-like, seeming to carry nothing but light and
color. Ruby, orange, topaz, rose—the color ran
overboard from upper and lower decks, and
dripped into the black sea, and poured far below
its surface in long, quivering filaments. The
vessels were not ferry-steamers any more. They
were the west’s fire-ships and their cargoes were
the sunset fires that they had just rescued from
under the cloud-avalanche.
I am for ever down in the green dusk between
the cliffs. The white gums have shed the last
strip of their old bark and now their limbs look
curiously human —femininely human. They are
so rounded, so pearly in colour, and so dimpled.
One of the chaste-looking trees grows by a thin
waterfall. She and I know each other well. To
me she is not a tree (if you look upon her as a tree
you see only a short, distorted gum), but a nymph
poised for a dive. A little space from the ground
the trunk swells into the contour of a woman’s
glistening form, and two boughs that are white,
glistening arms are half-raised, and half-veiled by
dark-green hair. “ Divinity disrobed ” is your
thought. It seemed to me that her dimples
deepened where I kissed them. Perhaps that
gum has a sense of humour.
I see the triumph of time in every fire-swept
patch. Every blackened sapling has a base-ring
of sprouts, and my blood runs swifter when I look
at them against the sun. You must see them as
you do stained - windows, every leaf glowing
crimson.
Spider-webs and dew! My road knows well
that morning when, at sunrise, it showed me
hundreds of thousands of webs—spiderless webs—
every strand pearled with dew. Whither had the
builders gone? Did they grieve that they had
wrought so uselessly ?
Down where my road loiters among- the camps
is a grassy patch. A band of white fowls with
scarlet combs and gills crop the grass. How much
greener it shows in contrast with those scarlet
splashes ! I nudge myself, saying “Do you
remember your first paintings ? Your grass and
trees were so green, yet you brightened them
further by putting in a red-frocked child or a
woman in a red sun-bonnet. How you loved the
result of that dab of crimson lake ! but you never
thought to introduce a crimson-gilled fowl.”
And when my road leads me to where I lose
sight of all but the towering gums, then comes the
impenetrable hour to me. I don’t know which is
more difficult to understand—God or the Gums.
There’s an aloofness about both that gives them a
likeness. Every gum-tree seems to me to have
large, grave, grey eyes that gaze down on me with
a fixed, passionless, spiritual gravity. There’s no
sympathy in those eyes. My desire is towards
them—but lam no more to them than the panting
lizards at their base. They absorb my in-
dividuality ; their silence is sublime, yet terrifying-
It is eloquent of language no' mortal ear may
understand.

his audience to “pray for the misguided young
men outside.”
The House of Commons is a most dignified
place. But they descend to the ridiculous now
and then. Slab from a recent London Daily
Telegraph report
Mr. Weir complained of a growing practice in London
of demanding omnibus-fares before the termination of the
journey. On a cold winter’s day, when he was gloved
and buttoned-up from top to bottom, he objected to hav-
ing to unglove and unbutton at the beginning of his
journey—(laughter)—and when the inspector came to
examine his ticket he simply felt as if he would like to
pitch him out. (More laughter.) What they wanted in
an omnibus was such peaceful calm and time for reflec-
tion as they would have in a private carriage. (Laughter.)
Sir M. White Ridley replied that he had no power to in-
terfere in these matters.
Mr. Weir was dissatisfied with the answer, and moved
to reduce the vote by £5O.
Mr. Maddison characterised Mr. Weir’s complaint as
absurd. (Hear, hear.) What inconvenience did an in-
spector cause to any passengers ?
Mr. Weir : Enormous. (Laughter.)
The amendment was rejected by 101 to 11; majority 90.
His Opinion.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The earth was cracked and dry, every vestige of
grass was dead, and save for the presence of an old
gin and a blackfellow the place might have been
deserted. Just a common little slab-and-bark hut,
mostly bark, dropped down in the centre of a
black-soil plain, bounded on all sides by the glis-
tening mirage. A few sheep, bogged in a little
blob of mud in front of the hut, and three cooli-
bahs, formed the foreground of this simple picture.
A man came to the door of the hut and looked
with aching eyes over the plain, cursed the sheep,
cursed the crows which were scientifically gouging
the eyes out of the poor brutes; then he said,
“ It’s a d d rotten country ! ” He wept inside
and rolled his swag. Next day the old gin and
her blackfellow reigned supreme.
Five years later the man stood on the step
of a comfortable cottage and looked over his 100-
acre patch of corn, the blossoming orchard and
the little grass-paddock with his milkers and
plough-horses, watered by a clear little creek.
“ It’s a grand country,” he said turning to his
wife, “ and with that ‘ hundred ’ we ought to fetch
out on top this year.”
When he came home from work that night his
wife was not in the house. He called ; then he
went to the bed and turned down the mattress.
It was gone, the precious “hundred” —and also
his wife !
He walked to the door and looked out. “It’&
a d rotten country ! ” he said.
Q.E.D.
The Argus makes a casual reference to
“British Christianity.” Which recalls the aris-
tocrat who, being reminded on his death-bed that
there was some danger of his eternal damnation,
trusted that God “would do nothing that would
be unbecoming in an English gentleman.”
“ Machadodorp ” to The Bulletin from
S’Africa :
I have read with disgust the complaints of a number of
“ returned invalids ” about their food and general treat'
ment in S’Africa, and will ask you to let me say a few
words in justice to those officers who have been attacked
by their men while possessing no chance of disproving the
charges. Ido not myself belong to the N.S.W. Mounted
Infantry, though I have worked side by side with them
for many months; neither have I been personally
animadverted upon, so far as I am aware, in the press, so
that lam writing disinterestedly. To begin with, all the
Mounted Infantry officers but one have had previous
military experience, and all I have seen are capable riders.
Also, Gen. Hutton, speaking to a section of the regiment on
this spot, some two weeks since, said that “ its work was
second to none in S. A.—that when ordered to cany out
some particularly tough job near Komati Poort, he
specially asked the C. in Chief for the N.S.W. Mounted
Rifles ; and that he was proud of being their Hon. Col.”
(the regt. is now called “ Mounted Rifles” on account of
its association with the Ist Contingent Mounted Rifles).
Again, Gen. Hamilton, in “orders” June 13th, said:
“ The G.0.C.,. in thanking all ranks for their gallantry
during the attack on Diamond Hill, must specially refer
to the conspicuous gallantry displayed by the N.S.W.
Mountedßifles(under Capt. Antill)in storming the heights
and pushing forward under a most murderous fire.”
No faint praise there ! Now, touching the clothing, pay
and rations over which those weak-stomached warriors
have been weeping. I have been right through the show,
and am confident no regiment has been better fed or
clothed than this one. The rations have been generally
excellent—far better, most probably, than the malcon-
tents have been accustomed to at home. What the food
was on board ship I know not, but on ours all hands were
fed like fighting-cocks, and it may be presumed the quality
is generally about the same. Then re pay. The men
have been paid whenever opportunity occurred, but with
a continuous trek of 10 weeks without a halt, and in the
neighborhood of the versatile De Wet, specie is hard to
come by. Also, the clothing brought by this lot was
better than I have seen worn by other troops—barring the
helmets, which were indeed very bad. It appears to me
that the men who have made all this clatter about their
treatment here are much on the same platform as a cer-
tain Australian officer, who was quickly “ stellenboshed ”
by Gen. Hutton, because he’s “ Got no guts, got no guts,
don’t you know.” It makes one sick to belong to such a
crowd.

Read how this young girl was cured with
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mrs. May Watson, 9 Rose Road, Surry Hills, Sydney, New So. Wales, sends
us the above photograph of her daughter, together with the following testi-
monial :
“My daughter was suffering terribly from eczema on both her hands and feet.
I had tried many remedies without success. Remembering I had received great
help from Dr. Ayer’s Sarsaparilla myself, I began to give it to my daughter.
Soon she showed signs of improvement, and after taking a few bottles the sores
disappeared and she is now free from the slightest symptom of the old complaint.
She is as fresh and healthy as any girl could wish to be. This makes me strongly
recommend this wonderful medicine to any one needing a good blood-purifier.”
Such cures always follow the use of
“The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”
Tou cannot feel well unless your blood is pure, and it must be rich, too. Dr.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla will give you both of these, pure blood, rich blood. That
is what you need and what you can quickly have if you will only give this old,
reliable remedy a good trial. Get your blood right and you will no longer suffer
with depression, nervousness, general debility, or some form of skin disease.
AYER’S Sarsaparilla
Brings Comfort and Good Cheer.
