The Red Page
Hell in Poland
No more vivid picture Of modern war has
ever been drawn than Jqfiify/ Morse's re-
markable account of An K nglish[nan in the
Russian Ranis (Duckworth, per Dymock’s
Library). John Morse is an Englishman,
04 years old, who, being at Ostrovo, a small
German town ten miles from the Russian
frontier, when the war broke out, managed
with considerable difficulty and some danger
to escape over the frontier into Poland.
This adventure was but the prelude to a
series of experiences almost incredible were
it not for the transparent honesty of the
author’s account. The individuality that
emerges from this narrative is that of a
typical Englishman, almost recklessly brave,
a born fighter, taking fill the dangers and
the hardships of his life with the self-reli-
ance of an old campaigner, and, though
cheerfully fighting in the ranks of the Rus-
sian army, shrewdly critical of the Cossack,
with a fixed hatred for the Hun, and firm in
the conviction that the Englishman is the
finest fighter, and the finest man, in the
world.
After his escape from Germany John
Morse could not help taking a rifle against
the Hun. For in Kalisz, the Polish town
to which he had made his way, he saw such
bestiality and hellish brutality on the part
of the invading German soldiers against
unarmed and defenceless people, that lie
could not resist the happiness of fighting
such fiends. For “at this hour no act -of
war, no fair fight or military operation, had
taken place on any of Germany’s borders.
She showed the bestiality of the cowardly
hyena before a fang had been bared against
her.” He also saw the organised murder
of civilians before a shot had been fired
between the armed forces of the two nations.
And, being allowed to join the Russian army
as a volunteer—a proceeding highly irregular
—John Morse fought for ten months in
Poland. It is impossible to detail his adven-
tures: wherever there was fighting John
Morse seemed to be in it. And always he
used his shrewd old campaigner’s eyes, and
in rough, vivid phrases conjures up for his
readers the horrible, muddled and inconclu-
sive fighting in Poland, as unlike the cam-
paign in Flanders as mediaeval warfare is
unlike modern.
“Another shot smashed away the head
of a man standing close to me. He threw
up his hands and stood rigid so long that
I thought he was not going to fall. The
sight of the headless trunk standing there
with blood streaming over the shoulders
was so horrible that it was quite a relief to
the nerves when he dropped. The gunners,
who had stood paralysed by the sight, re-
sumed their work....
“I had often read of rivers ‘running red
with blood,’ and thought that simply poetic
exaggeration; but when we went to a brook
to obtain water for some gasping men, I
noticed that it was horribly tinged with
dai’k red streaks, which seemed to be partly-
coagulated blood. Some light fragments
which floated by were undoubtedly human
brains; yet at their urgent entreaty we
gave of this water to poor creatures to drink,
for no other was available This horror
was not comparable to what we witnessed
when we arrived at the spot where the
artillery slaughter had taken place. Frag-
ments of flesh, arms, legs, limbs of horses
and scattered intestines lay everywhere....
Close to one of our guns were two brawny
hands, tightly clasping the handle of the
sponge with which their owner had been
cleaning the piece The man was close
by, a mere mass of smashed flesh and
bones, with thousands of beastly flies batten-
ing on his gore, as they were on that of
all the corpses... .Our wounded had been
murdered. There could be no question of
that.” .
But the Cossack and the Russian soldier
are happily able to meet such murders with
more than polite protests. The Cossack is
not built that way. “The Germans were
finished fiends, and deserved all they got
from a body of men notorious for their
fierceness; and they did get it. I will say
this, though: that throughout the campaign
no instance of a Russian injuring a woman
or a child came under my notice; nor did
I hear of any such cases.”. But the total
impression received from this eye-witness is
that of bitter, relentless fighting, deliberate
desolation of the country and destruction of
the peasants, on the part of the Germans, of
harsh reprisals on the part of the Russians,
of few prisoners and innumerable murders,
of Hell let loose between two armies that
were quite ready for the job. • And all for
what military purpose? The result left the
two contending forces just about where they
started, but now there is no country left
for the foes to fight about. The Poles don t
need to be told of that famous definition of
war.
Morse heard of a Russian woman who
commanded a regiment of Cossacks! He saw
some of these female soldiers. There was
nothing particularly romantic in the appear-
ance of any of them. Most of them had
the appearance of big, lanky, raw-boned
boys; faces oval, features “puddeny,” and
complexions pale. One girl, said to be only
18 years old, was six-feet high, with limbs
that would fit a grenadier. These Ama-
zons had enlisted as men, but when their
sex was discovered they were allowed to
remain in their regiments. Morse was
somewhat curious to learn where these
ladies lodged. He found that the girls slept
among the soldiers, but were relegated to
tents occupied exclusively by married men.
“My admiration was great. The wisdom of
the*' East still reigns in Muscovite brains.
Where else would one find the wisdom of the
serpent combined with the harmlessness of
the dove but in a tent full, of married men
unless, indeed, it would be in a tent full of
married ladies?”
Morse speaks of the rape of Polish women
by the Huns as of every-day occurrence. He
forbears to dwell on these facts for fear of
exciting disgust. “To say that the German
army is an organised band of criminals, a
trained body of thieves and murderers, may
seem to be far-fetched and exaggerated to
some persons; but if they had witnessed
what I have witnessed they would not say
so.” And Morse believes in retaliation. “It
is a powerful weapon to fight with. It
frightened the Germans and afterwards put a
check on their atrocities. I stood by and
saw 10 officers and 100 soldiers hanged....
Still I must say, with regard to the Cos-
sacks—they are terrible fellows.” In one
captured village where the Iluns had bivou-
acked, among the usual evidences of their
presence was a dish-cover left on a table.
On it being raised it revealed two pairs of
human hands severed at the wrists.
The Germans can fight, and fight bravely,
but not, says Morse, with the generous
bravery that most soldiers exercise one to
another. “They are cruel in their despera-
tion, vicious in the moment of victory;
and they yell for mercy in the hour of their
defeat.” But they seldom got it —from the
Russians. In one fight where Russians and
Germans fought for two hours 'without a
break on the same spot of ground, and 8000
Huns were killed, Morse notes that in the
bottom of the advanced trenches there was a
foot depth of blood which had drained from
the corpses; and the men occupying the
position were compelled to stand in it half-
leg deep for several days. In one part of
the trench Morse helped to remove a heap
of 69 corpses, lying 11 deep in the middle.
Those underneath had been smothered or
trampled to death.
The escapes of this soldier of fortune are
too numerous to mention. Once he was
knocked down by a big German, and saw the
point of the bayonet poised over him as his
enemy kept him down with his foot. A
Russian soldier blew out. the German’s brains
before that bayonet made its thrust; and
for the fifth time Morse was covered with
blood and brains that were not his own. And
the story of his capture by the Huns, his
wonderful escape and his terrible privations
is but one of the many exciting things that
happened to him.
And, true Englishman as he is, Morse
grumbles at the delays of his journey, a
broken man, back to England, mnd gets
annoyed at the inconveniences of “continental
travel.” He has his tourist’s growl after all
he had come through.
His comments are always original; his
thirst for information is incessant. All
through the fighting he seems like an English
tourist determined to get his money’s worth.
Here is one of his shrewd observations: —
“The Russian (including the Pole, and,
especially, the Cossack) is an Asiatic in
everything except his birth; and, like all
Asiatics, is extremely devout and extremely
bigoted ; therefore he is a fanatic; and this
present war is to him a sacred war —a con-
test for the safety of his religion, and sancti-
fied by the blessings of his priests. . . .He will
fight till he wins ; and I am confident that
the victory will greatly strengthen and con-
solidate the Muscovite Empire. Never before
have the Pole and the Russ stood side by
side as they are standing now; never before
have they fought for a common cause and
bled together for it. This war will make
Russian and P.ole one people. I am quite
convinced of it.”
“Only Me,” from Adelaide: As one who
has been continually in touch with
the reading public of Australia for a
good many years. I consider that
“Barcoo” on the Red Page (9/12/’l5)
is rather out of date in his references to
Charles Garbage. Two or three years ago
for a short period the works of the same
Garbage, like an influenza epidemic, -were
in many homes, but since that time the de-
mand for his piffling creations has been
steadily declining. In my experience, the
average flapper, after passing from the
Ethel Turner class of fiction, reads one
Garbage and then leaves him forever. “Bar-
coo” is also somewhat at sea when he states
that Nat Gould’s books are rarely seen or
asked for in circulating libraries. About
20 years ago when The Double Event
was published he was rushed, the rush cer-
tainly slackened after a while, but for the
past 10 or 15 years there has been a
good steady demand for all his works, chiefly
by men and boys. His books are still com-
ing to hand, and still claiming a regular
circulation. The four most popular writers
among readers of fiction are now Ethel M.
Dell, Gertrude Page, F. E. Mills Young
and Jeffery Farnol, and during the past
year the novels with the largest circulation
in libraries have been The Keeper of the
Door { E. M. Dell), Rig Tremaine (Mrs.
Van Yorst), Jeffrey (W. J, Locke), Michael
O’Halloran (G. S. Porter), Heart of the
Sunset (Rex Beach), Time O’Day (D.
Egerton Jones), and Follow After (G.
Page). The flapper demands and reads all
the above books, which shows that even a
flapper has a certain amount of discrimina-
tion.
A genuine “Flapper” asks for a hearing on
the question of Australian Flapperatnre:—
These are a few of the books stacked on my
dressing-table and mantelpiece, bought by myself or
exchanged from girl friends. (I have not risen to
the dignity of a library sub. yet) : “The History of
Mr. Polly,” “Notre Dame,” “The Old Wives Tale,”
“The Bible,” “Tono-Bungay,” both Poe’s Tales and
Poems, “The House Boat on the Styx,” A. L. Gordon,
“Balthaven,” “Lavengro,” Gilbert and Sullivan plays,
and “Omar Khayyam.” Seems decent enough reading
to my immature age and fancy, also I know of more
than one man, my superior in age and allegedly in
knowledge and intellect, who doesn’t read half as
good.
Australian.
Fredk. Watson’s fifth volume of Histori-
cal Records of Australia (first series, con-
sisting of Governors’ despatches to and from
England) covers the period, July,
August, 1806. Captain IViUiam
arrived in Port Jackson on August 7, 1806, in
succession to Governor Philip Gidley King.
During King’s administration new settle-
ments were made at Newcastle, and at tne
Tamar and Denvent rivers in Tasmania, in
1806 the population had passed the (000
mark. During King’s administration the
trade monopolies received a check by the suc-
cessful development of the agencies of Camp-
bell and Co., and Chace, Chinnery and Co.,
represented in Sydney by Kobert Campbell
and William Tough respectively. These two
firms built up a legitimate and regular trade
as distinct from speculative shipments in
times of want. “The removal of the settlers
from a condition of want and penury during
the years 1800-1806 was due more . to the
activities of Robert Campbell and his part-
ners, and to the system of government im-
portations, than to any exertions on the part
of Governor King.” Fredk. Watson finds
King incompetent, “not unwilling to take
advantage of his position as Governor to ob-
tain pecuniary profit for himself and his
family,” more prodigal of the royal preroga-
tive of pardon than any of his. predecessors,
severe, arbitrary and without direct influence
in the improvement of the conditions of life
in the colony. His severity may be judged
by his order that Tierney, one of the convicts
sent out for “sedition and rebellion in Ire-
land,” who plotted to murder the officers and
soldiers at Newcastle, should receive. 500
lashes, “or as many as he can take without
endangering his life.”

This page is willing to take the word of
John Tebbutt, F.R.A.S., of the Windsor Ou-
servatory, about .Tas. Stelle’s Early Days of
Windsor (Tyrrell’s, Sydney; 2s. 6d.). “As
a native of Windsor, with a clear recollection
of the past 75 years, I may say that the
author has spared no pains to make his
statements accurate and reliable. His work
will prove a felt want in the literature of
Windsor. .. .an invaluable work of reference
on all matters connected with the district.”
The substance of this volume was first pub-
lished in the local press, and the correspon-
dence that it aroused has enabled the assidu-
ous author to correct and expand his original
notes. The book is hardly a history of that
settlement first known as the Green Hills;
but it contains all the facts from which such
a history might be constructed.
R.L.S. devotees may be interested in Mrs.
R. L. Stevenson’s diary of The Cruise of the
Janet Nichol (Chatto and Windus, 7s. 6d.)
among the Pacific Islands in IS9O. The
author explains that many elisions have
been made in her diary—and it is just those
omitted passages that might have provided
a live interest to the book. But what there
is left of the diary is true. Mrs. Stevenson
says that there are too many books about
Stevenson written “by persons with whom
we were very slightly acquainted, or had
never consciously met....No one, outside
our immediate family., sailed with us on any
of our cruises. All the books ‘With Steven-
son* here and ‘With Stevenson’ there, are
manufactured... .false in almost every par-
ticular. Contrary to the general idea, my
husband was a man of few intimate friends,
and even with these he was reticent to a
degree.” Mrs. Stevenson’s mutilated diary
is dull. The photographs are excellent.
A second volume of Pierre Mille’s delight-
ful stories of the French Foreign Legion is
now issued under the title of Barnavaux
(Lane, per Dymock’s Library). These
stories of the marsouins in Madagascar are
very frank and very French—perhaps it is
the same thing. Barnavaux is worthy of com-
radeship with Kipling’s trio of soldier heroes.
There is delightful humor in the story of the
stout old nun, who, when the village was
threatened by hostile natives, and the onlv
white garrison was Barnavaux and his sick
comrade, dressed up in the sick man’s uni-
form and won a glorious victory. And, for
sheer grim realism and horror there have
been few stories written to compare with the
story of the Chinamen who, imported to
work on the Congo railway, discovered that
the contractor had not sent back to China
the coffins of their dead men. And, as it is
said that a corpse lies buried under everv
sleeper of that railway, there were plenty of
dead Chinese. But the Chinese that were
left didn’t mind, as long as they were sure of
returning to Chinese soil—in their coffins.
That clause was in their contract. The
remnant of the coolies deserted, with the
Chinese intention of making their way back
to China —across the continent of Africa!
They had no knowledge of the distance thev
had been transported; but they knew the
direction in which their native land lay. That
Odyssey of yellow-men through the forests
of Africa is told from the viewpoint of the
Chinese—an astonishingly impressive feat of
fiction. One Chinese emerged from that
place of devils and toads that were gods, only
to find himself still far from China. How-
ever, he found compensations at Zanzibar, as
the reader will see.
Mary E. Lloyd cheekily and neatly tells us
of the Men I Have Proposed To (Edwards,
Dunlop, Sydney). This is frivolous pabulum
for heat-wave weather, typically Australian
and nicely flapperisli. Her list is a long one,
and occasionally she shows the instinct for
comedy. Mostly, however, she contents her-
self with merely saying cheeky things. Her
characterisations are sometimes neat. “Clive
Darvel was a very rpmantic-looking youth.
He wore silver-buckleil shoes to work, and
always carried a stick to point out beautiful
cloud-effects.” And she is right about the
man who is funny before breakfast. “Isn’t
all early-morning humor a cowardly thing?”
And there is a deep truth about the woman
who had had three husbands. “I forget the
last two. A woman can only be expected to
remember her first husband. Of course, bits
of the others are bound to get mixed up with
the first memory. It’s the mixture that
makes the first one so precious, perhaps.”
The Latest Elinor Glyn
The most delightful joke played by the
author of Three Weeks upon her special pub-
lic is Elinor Glyn’s Three Things (Duck-
worth, 2s. Gd.). What Elinorglynnist,
eagerly purchasing Three Things, would
guess what those three things were? After
Three Weeks, who knows what they would
be? The three things are: Truth, Common
Sense and Happiness! Any one of her
weeks would prove more exciting than the
whole three things. The book is merely a
sloppily-written, and occasionally ungram-
matical, series of dull essays, though on the
subject of marriage Elinor may plead to be
heard as an expert.
‘Tn marriage man forgets that his kind
words of love and sympathy matter far more
to the actual happiness of the woman than
any of his deeds: because words till and
satisfy her imagination, which is active
whenever she is alone; and kind deeds, with
few or indifferent words, make very little
impression on it. Woman forgets—or will
not face —the fact that man is by nature a
polygamous animal.” For the man, mar-
riage is an ideal, and not a natural state;
for the woman fidelity is the natural state.
Every woman who marries owes her husband
as much as he took her for. “If for her
money, and she knows it is that, and she has
been sufficiently humble to accept him on
those terms—she ow'es him money. If for
love—she owes him at least the outside ob-
servances of love.” Anyhow, “she had bet-
ter make the best of her bargain.... The
man nearly always cools the soonest, because
of his fundamental instincts and the force of
satiation. He then probably goes on liking
his wife. . . .but the thrill which used to come
when her hand even touched his hand is no
longer there, and he only feels emotion to-
wards her when he is in the mood, which
would make him feel it towards any woman
who happened to be there at the moment....
Woman must always remember that man is
conquering primitive nature in being faithful
to her at all, and therefore she ought to look
to her own every point of attraction to
make it possible (if not easy!) for him to
fulfil her desire. .. .To teach the boys a new
and higher sense of honor is the only possible
way to alter matters, as a grown man is sel-
dom changed.... Selfishness is another basic
instinct of man.” Elinor does not believe,
man being the mere brute that he is. that
divorce should be granted for the same reason
to women as it is now' to men. Infidelity
in man is a mere following of natural im-
pulses : infidelity in woman is a following of
grafted impulses.
There’s a lot more, but none of it is as
soul-satisfying as the portrait of the author
on the cover or the delicate titillation of the
title.
The Ballet of the Nations, “a present-day
morality,” by Vernon Lee (Chatto and
Windus) is one of those freak publications
that depend for their sale upon small pad-
docks of “precious” prose surrounded by
artistically designed barbed-wire fences of an
impressionistic hue. This is called “a pic-
torial commentary,” and as the fence is
much more interesting than the paddock, the
name of the designer, Maxwell Armfield. de-
serves prominence. The letterpress is a foot-
ling allegory of the war; the commentary
is _ freakishly and startlingly clever. But
neither paddock nor fence mean anything.
Myths and Legends of Ancient Egypt,
by Lewis Spence (Harrap, 7s. 6d.), owes its
value chiefly to the number and excellence
of the photographs of Egyptian statues and
papyrus with which it is illustrated. The
book is written in popular language by an
author who thinks it necessary, and there-
fore forces his reader to think it necessary,
to put forth his qualifications in dealing
with such a difficult subject. For the gen-
eral reader, however, this book will convey,
in casual fashion, something of wffiat ancient
Egypt and the Egyptians W'ere. The myths
are admirably recounted.
Diversions of a Naturalist, by Ray Lan-
kester (Methuen), contains, like a dictionary,
a considerable amount of miscellaneous in-
formation. For instance, the wombat is the
only animal that shares with the higher apes
and man the doubtful distinction of posses-
sion of an appendix. These “detached essays
addressed to a wide public” range from
shrimps to the missing link, from fast-days
to palmistry, from birth-marks to the lym-
phatic system. They have the same appeal
that the topical gazette has for the patron
of the movies, and make about as fleeting an
impression.

12, 16 and 20 Gauge
Light, Hammerless Repeating
Shotguns
Sportsmen differ as to whether a 12, 16 or 20 Gauge is
the best shotgun for field shooting, but the knowing
ones agree that the Winchester Model 1912 lightweight,
hammerless repeater is the one best bet in the shotgun
line. This Winchester being made in 12, 16 and 20
gauges permits an advocate of the big, medium or small
bore to indulge his fancy and be sure of getting a gun
that is true to its gauge in balance, weight and length.
All three gauges of this model, are made of specially
selected materials. Nickel steel, which is twice as
strong as ordinary grin steel, is used throughout for the
metal parts in this Winchester. This means a light-
weight gun without sacrificing safety or strength.
This gun has a cross-bolt trigger lock, a smooth,
\ quick and easy action, and a simple Take-Down
system. It loads and unloads easily and its shoot-
ing qualities are not excelled by the highest priced
double guns. There are many other pleasing and
exclusive features of this Winchester which appeal to
sportsmen that could be enumerated, but the gun itself
is the best evidence of its quality and desirability,

A (rut REMEDY for
BLADDER TROUBLE.
Drinking water that is of bad quality or
too soft often causes bladder trouble. Every
sufferer tortured with the agonising burning
pains of bladder inflammation (cystitis)
should try a harmless remedy which gives
relief in ninety-nine cases out of every hun-
dred in a Way that can only be described as
miraculous.
This torture and pain is caused through
germs in the bladder. De Witt's Kidney
and Bladder Pills contain a very strong,
yet marvellously soothing antiseptic, which

penetrates the diseased tissues, attacks and
destroys the germs, makes the urine after a
time bright and clean, bringing a wonderful,
quick sense of relief and ease.
If you are troubled with rheumatism,
gout, gravel, backache, tired feeling, dropsy,
Bright’s disease, constipation, cloudy urine,
inflammation of the bladder, or other
symptoms of urinary trouble you should
give this wonderful remedy a trial imme-
diately, because it brings quick relief, almost
every time —guaranteed—and a sure cure
follows in most cases.
To cure rheumatism or any other form
of kidney trouble you must positively get
rid of the cause —the poisonous uric acid.
Remember to do this a real remedy must
pass through the kidneys and the bladder
and not through the bowels, as most kidney
pills do. When you see the urine change
to a muddy hluisli color —a feature which
distinguishes De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder
Pills from all others —you know beyond all
doubt that they have put their healing touch
on the right spot—the kidneys and the
bladder. A wonderful pill—straight to the
kidneys—that is why De Witt’s Pills give
such amazingly quick relief —every time.
A permanent cure follows in almost every
case. Look for that blue-colored urine.
Don’t waste a single hour. Go to your
chemist at once and ask him for a 2s. 9d.
box of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills,
which are made expressly for kidney and
bladder troubles.

MOST MEN would cure themselves of the
Tobacco habit if they knew they could
do so easily and without discomfort.
It takes but ten minutes for tobacco to
change the beats of the heart. To keep it up
is to tempt death by Heart Disease, Nervous
Collapse, Tobacco Cancer, and Stoma'ch,
Liver or Kidney Disease.
TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a harmless, vege-
table remedy that will make the user of
tobacco in any form absolutely abandon the
habit for good. It not only destroys the crav-
ing, the desire, the appetite for tobacco, but
restores to health the entire nervous system,
and aids nature in entirely eliminating from
the system the Nicotine Poison.

The Garden of Herbs.
v 9o’ ing to . the shortage of medicinal and other
erbs caused by the war, herb-growing is said to be
a pleasant and profitable field for woman's labor.
fu herb gardens life went very sweetly,
borne Edith bending o’er her thyme and
rue,
Her hood beneath her dimpled chin tied
neatly,
Toiled in her simple gown of homespun
blue.
The walls, with ivy laced, were grey and
hoary.
The knight had heard the call to valiant
deeds.
The homing swallows knew the gentle story—
The soldier fighting while the girl hoed
weeds.
The battle-cloud seemed far, the hours were
sunny ;
Gold, blue and red the blossom stars were
set
About the beds where droning bees made
honey
In those old days of Ned Plantagenet.
Time running circles on the track of ages
Comes to the selfsame spot that once he
knew,
And. while afar the new-made hatile rages,
Edith still stoops above her thyme and rue.
Still, while her knight is seeking fame and
glory,
About her chin the dimples come and go—
Oh, anyone can make a pleasant story
Who sees a fair girl leaning on a hoe!

The Lake at Waipa Prison Camp.
When in the prison file we go
Our winding, silent way,
The lady lake takes pity ; so
Full twenty times a day
She dons a choice new dress for us,
Waving a sly caress for us,
To salve the dull distress for us
Who tramp the prison way.
Her nightgown is of fleecy mist.
But at the gleam of dawn
She changes for an amethyst
Pale morning-gown of lawn,
And softly then she sighs for us,
Planning this sweet surprise for us,
To glad the sad sunrise for us
Who face the prison dawn.
The red sun’s wanton fingers probe
To lift her gown and spy,
His hot eye finds a silken -robe
Of thwarting dark-green dye,
And, oh! we see her smile for us.
Her thought is all the while for us,
She shows this winsome guile for us
Who know the prison spy.
But when the sky is blue and free
She opes her wardrobe door,
And takes a dress of dimity
And white-flecked pinafpre,
And laughs in rippling play-for us,
Telling in whispers gay for us,
That soon will come the day for us
To pass the prison door.

De Mortuis.
You say he’s dead ? I hope he’s damned!
Be charitable? Why should I?
In life he cheated, lied and shammed ;
At least Death's honest. Let him die!
A smug, pretentious Pharisee,
He made his prayers a profit show;
He crooked a meek, subservient knee,
And crawled alike to friend and foe.
To me he made his plaintive whine.
And “Would I help him?” Well, I did
I helped him. How could I divine
The infamy his cringing hid?
I helped him, and he ruined me;
Disgrace and shame my recompense.
He prospered in his villainy,
And blossomed to magnificence.
And when I sought to gain redress,
He patronised me with a sneer,
And blandly chid my bitterness,
And urged me still to persevere.
The pliant knave ! I’m glad he’s dead !
His soul was with deception crammed.
Faithless in all he did or said!
De mortuis? I hope he’s damned!

NORMAN CAMPBELL.
From Middle Harbor, Sydney.
The opal-colored hillsides slept.
Among the woods a little smoke
Drifted, pale blue. The shadows woke
Like fauns among the clefts, and crept
Stealthily upward, through the trees
Whose melancholy harmonies
Murmured of long-lost mysteries.
Upon the waters still and grey
The tiptoe wind had to and fro
Woven white arabesques, as though
In some strange dance. The harbor lay
A mirror of 'dull steel, that seemed
Bronze-bordered, where the dark woods
gleamed,
Like images half-seen, half-dreamed.
Ope plume of smoke, far off and dim,
Melted....a seagull’s twittering cry
Grew thin and dwindled down the sky,
So frail and blue on the world’s rim,
Oh was it mist or cloud or fire
Or coast to which my dreams aspire
Of all unrealised desire?

OUR SHARE OF THE SPOILS.
The fact that we are taking our share in
the big war on behalf of an empire which,
in spite of its white patches, runs to black,
tan and other shades has caused a lot of
people to get cold-footed about the White
Australia policy. Meeting Japan and India
on equal terms in the field, it seems
impossible to a certain class of thinkers that
a color line should ever again be successfully
drawn, or that Australia should be allowed
to work out her own destiny according to
her own wishes and ideals. If such a view
were a correct one, Australians might well
pause before continuing their part in a
struggle which must end in national disaster
only the more surely because of the victory
to our arms. In other words, if to crush
the Kaiser it were necessary to give up the
brightest and best of our national dreams,
we might reasonably stop and reckon up the
relative cost of victory and defeat. But no
such calculation is necessary, and all the
chill that has gone to some feet is entirely
misplaced ; for the war, instead of destroying
the hope of a White Australia, should have
the effect of winning for that hope an inter-
national certificate of merit and perma-
nently fixing it in the world’s peace creed.
When the war ends in the only way in
which it can end, by the destruction of Prus-
sianism and all it stands for, there will be
very considerable spoils to divide. In a
general way, it may be taken for granted
that the Ottoman Empire will have to go
out, and that in its going it will leave plenty
of room for territorial expansion on the
part of Russia, France and Italy. England,
too, will probably stick to some slice of
Shem’s old playground, as well as to enor-
mous areas of the African continent. France
will get her lost provinces; Italy will draw
into her kingdom the scattered fragments of
the Italian-speaking people; Russia will at
last find the city of Constantine in her
grasp. Japan will get a fair return for her
efforts in the Allies’ cause; and even the
sullen neutrality of Greece will probably be
paid for to the last farthing. The new map
of the world ought to be highly satisfactory
to all the parties who hold the right end of
the stick when peace comes home and the
Teuton is on his knees. Having put in
the field an army as hig as any which the
whole British Empire had ever accomplished
up to 20 years ago, the Common-
wealth will have a right to a say both
in the peace terms and in the sharing of the
plunder. Then our opportunity will have
come. We will ask nd territorial aggrandise-
ment ; and therein will lie the strength of our
position. But if our statesmen are up to
their job and alive to our interests, they will
secure for the White Australia policy a place
in the world treaty by which the future is
to be governed. Asking for the recognition
of this one thing in return for all our toils
and the good Australian blood spilled, we
should be able to make the whole world
partner in a guarantee which would be the
Great Charter of our nation.
Hitherto the White Australia policy has
had no serious backing of force except our
own small but growing fleet and our citizen
army of doubtful efficiency. We had no
great reason to hope that the power of
Britain could be exerted on behalf of a doc-
trine which the English taxpayer would be
unable to understand, and which might be
regarded as objectionable by millions of
people‘who live under the British flag. On the
question of upholding our right to exclude
whom we would from this continent we
might have had the sympathy of the United
States of America, the applause of Canada
and possibly a wave of a handkerchief or
tw r o from S’Africa and some of the South
American republics. But the big countries
of the world would have remained supremely
indifferent, and we should as likely as not
have been compelled to face the task of
backing our determination with rifle bullets
against the advice of statesmen in London
and without any certainty of practical help
from any quarter. All this the war will
alter. Not only has Australia’s valor im-
pressed England to such an extent that Aus-
tralian views and aspirations must hence-
forth get an entirely different hearing in
London, but the great Allies of Britain are
brought into direct -contact with us as co-
partners in one tremendous undertaking. In
the Commonwealth’s after-war bargain there
is no good reason why the solid backing of
France, Ttussia and even Italy should be
withheld from the young nation which, hav-
ing done her full share of a big job, asks
nothing in return but the right to shut her
garden gate against whom she will. Japan,
satisfied with her own share of the general
division,, should be ready to meet and to
understand us, and to recognise that there is
neither slight nor injury intended in a policy
which accepts her as a friend but excludes
her as a bedfellow. On all indications there
is not the slightest reason to tremble more
for the future of our national ideal now that
we are entering into a world-league of
nations than there was when we stood in
lonely isolation.
More than this; the effective occupation
of the continent, on which alone any
national policy can stand, might be brought
appreciably nearer by taking full advantage
of the new international friendships of the
after-the-war period. Not only is the pion-
eering business likely to appeal to our re-
turning soldiers who will have love of adven-
ture in their blood, but the vast armies of
the allied nations should furnish us with
countless recruits for the war against the
northern wilderness. That there will be
an exodus of magnitude from Europe seems
certain ; but, far from fearing the invasion of
our shores by hardy veterans of the great
struggle, we should be prepared to welcome
them as settlers and turn their energies to
account. The men who have wrestled with
the Kaiser’s big guns up and down the
French and Russian fronts, and turned over
an area equal to Tasmania with their
trenching tools, should take lightly and joy-
fully to the settler’s life in Northern Aus-
tralia. Of course, the desire to crowd any-
thing that looked cheap and energetic into
Sydney and Melbourne would be strong
among some of our noisiest patriots; but the
chances are that the ex-fighter, well directed,
would of his own choice select the open
spaces for his home; and it is there that he
is needed. Every white soldier setting up
his verandah-posts north of Alice Springs
would be fortifying the future against the
chance of calamity; and the White Aus-
tralia policy would be the standing guaran-
tee of the new settlers’ security of tenure in
the homes of their choice. The people who
read black labor in the Kaiser’s fall are as
blind to the real trend of events as those
who read national ruin in a compulsory call
to military service.
THE PLACE WHERE THE HUN IS
GOING TO GET HURT.
One of the earlier hobgoblins of the war
was that as soon as the disturbance ended
Germany, having meanwhile kept her indus-
trial activities at full blast, would flood the
world with vast quantities of cheap goods.
But the trouble has lasted too long for
that. The German is now all-in on the
war. His raw materials are being used up
in the terrific conflict. When he isn’t
carrying a gun he is getting himself
mended or buried. His wife and mother-in-
law are working on the farm and in the
shell-factory. If the war ended to-morrow
it is, then, not a great accumulation of manu-
factures that Germany would oblige other
countries to compete against, but rather the
grit, industry and adaptability which made
it a dangerous industrial competitor in the
past. Nevertheless, when the German wipes
the blood out of his eye and begins to take
up the threads of the business he dropped
and calls round to look for customers, he
is going to have a pain. The rest of the
world has not been idle; wherefore Fritz
is going to discover himself contemplating
a price list which beats his own, and beats
it hollow. It will be issued from Yokohama,
and Fritz will have as much chance of com-
peting with it as he has of catching kan-
garoos in Poland. Moreover, when, pinch-
ing himself, he tries to compete, the other
fellow will drop his pj-ices a bit, and if he
keeps on trying the other fellow will drop
them some more, and will tread him as
flat as last year’s beer and make him work
17 hours a day on a diet of synthetic saus-
ages. Japan has grabbed with both hands
the opportunity presented by the Teutonic
adjournment of trade, and is building 1
enormous profits on the job. Her excess o
exports over imports will this year reacn
£13,250,000, which is more than the aggie-
gate of all previous years’ surpiuses. ihe
will this year displace over £10,000,000 ot
imports with her own products and will
add between £7,000,000 and £8,000,000 to
her exports. t ,
Japan’s manufactures of metal,
leather goods, drugs, dyes, cement, oil, fer-
tilisers, glass, railway material and paper
have all gone up with a bang. Her enter-
prises are spreading over the whole hem oi
industrial activity, including transport by
sea. Japanese vessels have a monopoly ot
the U.S.-Jap trade, are making tremendous
profits in Indian waters and are pushing on
in increasing numbers to Europe, with car-
goes realising prices practically at a level
with those prevailing for goods of Euro-
pean manufacture. The demand for manu-
factures is now so great, owing to the dis-
location of industry in the war-stricken
countries and in the U.S.A., where muni-
tions form the main output, that competi-
tion in prices can scarcely be said to exist.
The result is that Japanese manufacturers
are getting the largest profit ever known.
They are producing at the Japanese rate
of wages and selling at the European level.
The profit of eight chemical companies has
been over 100 per cent, for the year, and
textile companies have made five times the
amount of their capital. W hen it comes
to competition the Jap exporter, after mak-
ing a cut of 25 per cent., will thus be able
to make another and still be on a good
wicket. He, controls an almost inexhaust-
ible supply of skilful, docile labor at a cost
only fractional of what European and
American manufacturers have to reckon on
in production. According to the foreign
trader this circumstance is one to be wel-
comed with loud approval. It gives another
country an opportunity to buy cheaply. In-
cidentally, it also gives the other country,
if it is unprotected, the privilege of choos-
ing between having no industries at all or
establishing some on the basis of tuppence
a day 7. Of course we should be then told
that a hat factory in Australia which could
only produce hats at 3s. would be an
“exotic” industry if hats could be indented
from Fusiyama at threepence each. This
doctrine is by no means dead in the haunts
of importers. At most it only sleepeth —
with one eye open. There are profits in the
wind —fine large profits too, because the
figure at which Japanese can sell need not
be the one at which the consumer could
buy. The selling price could be measured
best by the figure at which goods in com-
petition were procurable.
Meanwhile, apparently, Australian states-
manship is not yet convinced that the time
is ripe to do anything in the way of giving
Australian industry a shove forward. The
war has given German trade a heavy punch ;
it has pushed Japanese trade and equipment
for trade and keenness in pursuit of tech-
nical skill forward at the rate of knots; it
has played havoc with many industries in
Britain; it has left manufacturing trade in
Australia just where it was before, trying
to stand upright and secure at least moment-
ary advantage from abnormal conditions, but
fully exposed to the cold blasts of a wind
before which most of it would perish in a
night. Hughes is content to airily remark
that his “views are well known” and that
he is ready to do whatever is required—
later on. Tudor finds it sufficient to be occa-
sionally platitudinous. Treasurer Higgs is
immersed in the cashbox. Yet though there
is all this silence and inertia in Australia,
old John Bull is beginning to show that
mere talk about the Hun’s trade is much less
interesting to him than consideration of his
own trade. While John was a kind of inter-
national creditor the Cobden superstition
was good enough to piffle along with. Britain
was making money, anyhow. But lately the
nation has been piling up a debt which looks
like the Himalayas heaped on Kosciusko;
wherefore it now sees the need to keep out
imports, because imports mean payments to
a foreigner. Runciman, the Minister for
Trade, a life-long Freetrader, made no pre-
tence the other day, during a debate in the
House of Commons, that the bursted old
notion of tha open market conld be main-
tained under the changed conditions. Men
who used to be pronounced Cobdenites have
lately been petitioning him to at any
rate throw the extreme part of their doctrine
overboard, and by a scheme of subsidies on
production encourage_ those industries which,
through cheap foreign competition, have
been brought either to a state of decay or
next door to it. Neither they nor Runciman
are bothering themselves so much about what
the Hun is going to do as directing their
brains to a consideration of their own
national affairs. It is the only attitude from
which anything useful can be expected.
Here in Australia our business is not to
waste time, until the German gets going
again. It is not to contemplate Japan as
the source from which a fresli stream of
cheap supplies can be obtained in order to
save Australians the trouble of getting to
work. The business of Australia—more
urgent, more pressing now than at any stage
of her history—is to acquire the habit of
producing the things that our people want
and others will buy. And that means not
merely an effective tariff but the patriotic
co-operation of manufacturers and work
people. Hughes has stirred Australia with
his appeals to unionists to fight for their
country. But there is something else some-
one must appeal to them to do—to work for
their country: and especially to alfide by
awards, so that the employer mav in figuring
for a job know exactly what his labor costs
will be.
BOLER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“And that,” said my guide, the Chief Sub-
Curator of the Happy State, “is Boler.”
He spoke with an odd mixture of rever-
ence and rapt affection ; as a Britisher might
talk of a Lister, a Kitchener and a St.
I RANCis of Assisi combined, assuming sucli
a prodigy 7 were possible. IVfy eyes rested
upon one of those statues which move the
{esthete to frenzy. It showed a common-
place citizen in a very long frock coat and
large boots. lie would have been about st)
when the outrage was perpetrated. In his
right hand he held a hat suggestive of a
bucket superimposed upon a plate. His left
was raised as though he were hailing a cab
He displayed sparse whiskerings, and a low-
ish forehead from which the hair had re-
ceded to an imaginary line drawn over the
top of the head between the ears. lie might
have been a shop-walker, or an indent agent
or a mayor, or anything else of an undistin-
guished nature.
“But why,” I asked —“why put up a
statue to him?”
“It is Boler,” said my companion.
“Boi.er, our benefactor, the nation’s idol."
“Oh,” I answered, unenlightened, “of
course. How dull of me! One of your
philanthropists.”
“No,” said the other, shortly. “Not a
philanthropist —at any rate in the sense of
money-giving. He had no money. In fact,
ho was always hard up, and would have
been bankrupt several times —though the
Happy State treated- him well latterly
Jjut for generous friends and admirers.”
“I see,” I broke in. “A great orator, and
a master of words, a spell-binder, the
People’s Boler and all that sort of thing.”
“No!” thundered my guide. “As a
speaker he was hopeless. Besides, he had a
cleft palate and a defective voice. He”
“A great poet,” I ventured. “A sort of
superior Siiakspeare.”
“Nothing of the sort,” said njy friend
irritably. “He was the man who first
thought of destroying the Herellyer weed.”
I could not conceal my disappointment.
“It seems a lot of fuss to make about a
—er botanist or gardener or whatever he
was,” I remarked.
“ Gardener!” ejaculated my companion.
“Do you know what the Herellyer weed
was? Do you realise the damage it did—
that only since it was destroyed have we
been able conscientiously to assume the title
Happy State? Why, his achievement has
meant more to us than all the speeches that
were ever made, all the plays that were ever
written, all the victories that were ever
won !”
“What was the Herellyer weed?” I asked.
ITe looked at me half suspiciously.
“You’ve never even heard of it?” he said
incredulously.
“Never heard of it, nor of Boler, nor of
anything connected with either of them,”
I replied shortly.
The tremendousness of my ignorance
seemed to baffle him. lie waved his hands
helplessly.
“Well, you see,” he explained vaguely,
“the weed in Boler’s time was pretty well
crcri/thing. Half our physical and mental
troubles came from it. It grew all over the
place, and people used to eat it and go mad.
Then it had other effects, like the diet of
those island people who get elephantiasis. It
produced a sort of leprosy, only worse. The
victims of it decayed ; yes, absolutely rotted;
their extremities fell off. So did their hair
and teeth, and often they went blind.”
I broke in just as he was warming to his
hideous narrative.
“But why in the name of sanity,” I de-
manded. “didn’t they dig up the infernal
thing before?”
“Well, it all seems very obvious now,”
he said. “But you see we had had it a long,
long time —for centuries really—and every-
body had got used to it in a way. It wasn't
like a new horror —war, for example. We
had our asylums all ready to receive the vic-
tims, and our doctors, whose incomes were
derived in great part from attending to suf-
ferers, direct and otherwise, from the pest.
And then there were the parsons who said
it was sent by Don, and therefore should not
be interfered with ; and the political econo-
mists who argued that the State was taking
too much upon its shoulders already and
should be prevented from further Social-
istic meddling with the health of the people.
But see,” and he grasped my arm, “you are
going to have an object-lesson this very min-
ute in what the people think of Boler.”
Along a path which wound among flower-
beds to the plinth of the statue came a small
army of children. Their beautiful little faces
glowed with health and happiness, and their
round, fat arms were full of flowers. They
piled their burdens round the statue until
it was enveloped up to its preposterous feet
in summer blooms, and then stood reveren-
tially while a teacher gave them a brief
address on Boler and why children had to
love and honor his name.
“You see,” said my guide, when they had
gone, “that will give you some idea of what
the children think of Boler. Thousands of
them decorate his statue every year in token
of gratitude. If he is canonised, as many
members of all the churches think he ought
to be, there is a feeling that he should be
made the children’s saint.”
My look of utter bewilderment en-
couraged him to proceed.
“The children, after all.” he explained.'
“were the ones who benefited most from
Boler’s courageous move. The adult who
consumed the Horellyer weed didn’t suffer
immediately as a result of his indulgence.
The doctors could generally postpone his
punishment for 20 or 30 years, if not for
life. But his children, in many cases, were
damned from birth. They came into_ the
world with obscure and incurable afflictions.
Some were lame or hump-backed or blind,
others were neurotics —curses to themselves
and all associated with them —sufferers from
dreadful skin complaints, possessors of club
feet and withered hands —poor little mon-
sters. The extirpation of the Herellyer weed
ruined most of our private asylums, brought
about a huge reduction in the staff of the
public mad-houses and hospitals, and dm
appalling damage to the doctors’ earnings;
yet even the medical profession was recon-
ciled to its loss after a while by reason of
the decrease in infantile mortality which
followed. The doctors argued” M .
“But what beats me.” I interrupted. |S
that you stood the cursed thing for so much
as a day. Where did it grow- ?”
“Everywhere,” said my friend laconi-
cally. “In the streets, in the public parks.
i:i the country and in private gardens. R
flourished in the hot-house atmosphere ot
restaurants and theatres, and it grew with
equal luxuriance in the perishing cold of the
mountains. It was this that made Boler s
task so hard. People said to him, when he


first mooted his idea of wiping the weed out,
But you can’t, man ! It isn’t practicable.
There’s too much of it. Get sense.’ How-
ever, Boler was one of those dull, unim-
aginative characters who refuse to recog-
nise difficulties. He manoeuvred in his own
heavy, dogged way till he got into Parlia-
ment. and then he manoeuvred further till
he became Minister for Undesirable Plants.
This was his chance. He did not need, as
the law stood, to bring in any legislation.
He was able to proceed by administrative
acts. His first move was to call for the
registration of all those —whether private
individuals or public bodies —who were
growers of Herellyer; his next to issue a
public notice that within a given date all
weeds would have to be destroyed—in de-
fault, a heavy penalty. You can imagine
the outcry. The Daily Scream, in its
leader entitled ‘Predatory Socialism Gone
Mad,’ opined bitterly that the nurseries
would be invaded by the State next and
the cots examined to see if they were aired.
The conservative section of the House ex-
pressed the view that Boler had lost his
reason, and on his declining to renounce
his policy threw books, rulers, inkstands
and other articles at him. The leader of
the Opposition begged him tearfully to de-
sist —at any rate, till after the war. High-
minded people wrote to the papers to the
same effect. A public indignation meeting
was held in which Boler was denounced
for bothering over so trivial a thing as the
■rTerellyer weed while the Empire was in
peril. Scores of clergymen showed clearly
from the pulpit that he must be an Atheist.
But, as I said before, Boler was one of
those stolid, plugging characters to whom
the opinion of the world is as nothing. He
pushed ahead regardless of protests. Bleek,
the millionaire, who rashly tried to conceal
the existence of a small plot of Herellyer
in one of his numerous gardens, was fined
mercilessly, and warned that if it hap-
pened again he would be imprisoned. It
was about this time that the papers began
to come round. I remember the Daily
Scream said, in commenting on Bleek’s
case: ‘As we have contended from the first,
Mr. Boler’s wise policy must be carried out
with reference to the pleasaunces of the rich
and the back-yards of the poor alike. This
reform, for which we have always called,
must be no sectional affair. It will fail of its
object else.’ I first understood that Boler had
the entire community behind him when the
political party which had originally flung
missiles at him began to claim his reform as
its own. By this time its usefulness was
established. The Herellyer weed had almost
vanished. Its complete banishment was in
sight. The Government was being repaid
a thousandfold for its efforts in the im-
proved health, and consequently increased
producing power, of the community. There
came a time when the man who argued that
the Herellyer weed should never have been
attacked was regarded as an imbecile.”
“And so I should think!” I broke in.
“So I should think ! And you mean to tell
me that there were such men? That the
State harbored citizens so vile as to wish to
perpetuate the horrors which you have
described? Monstrous! Incredible!”
My companion remained impassive.
“They exist in every community,” he said
simply. “They are not vile. It is only that
they cannot see and understand. Maybe you
have them in your own State.”
H. SINGEMOINE.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Majestic Reign of Law’n’order.
The sort of thing that threatens to be in
the papers the day after to-morrow;—
THE PUBLIC WEAL.
Social Organisation Extending.
The Committee of Public Safety met yesterday
morning for the despatch of routine business.
e President said he was glad to announce that,
hough the war was proceeding with unabated fury,
the cost of maintaining the struggle had not been
allowed to exceed £2,000,000 a week. This enabled
the committee to expend the £1,000,000 a week
which had been reckoned a fair thing in carrying on
the committee’s most important inquires and activi-
ties. The total debt connected with the war now
amounted to £200,000,000, and £600,000,000 had
been borrowed to provide employment for the people;
but owing to the magnitude of our great national
resources this trifling sum could be handed on to
posterity with complete confidence that the nation’s
great grandchildren would pay it. The present duty
of every patriot was to spend to the utmost of his
ability. As the Committee had found that there
were people who could not spend fast enough to
satisfy their sense of proportion, the Committee had
established a Bureau of Information. This would
furnish ways and means of rapid spending. It had
been put in charge of Mr. David Hall. The Com-
mittee desired to again impress upon citizens that in
the hour of national trial everyone must co-operate
in the great struggle to defeat the common foe.
STRIKES BY WORKMEN.
Charges against 7962 workmen employed by the
State and 62 in the service of private firms were then
proceeded with.
The President: What are the facts?
The Court-Orderly: There are no facts.
Thirty-seven lawyers, appearing for employers,
at once leaped to their feet, but were sternly ordered
by the Committee to sit down.
The President: Is there anyone here representing
the Crown?
A young man came forward and said he did.
The President: Proceed, brother.
The Young Man: The defendants in this case
stopped work four months ago as a protest against
the price of meat being maintained at 4s. 34d. per
pound. They found it impossible to live on their
scanty earnings.
The President: How have they lived since?
The Young Man: By levies upon vegetarians. The
strike has led to cessation of several industries.
The Committee: Thank God !
The President: After giving this matter mature
consideration, the Committee decided that, no evidence
having been offered against the accused, they must be
discharged.
A SERIOUS CASE.
An indictment charging James Webday with hav-
ing failed to knock off five minutes before the cease-
work bell rang was next taken.
It was explained by the Court-orderly that the
award provided for every man washing his hands
before knock-off time. The danger to the public
health from a breach of this provision was consider-
able.
The prisoner said he had been trying to finish
some work urgently needed by the Defence authorities.
The President: There is no possible excuse for this
reckless conduct. The prisoner will be fined 3d.,
and if he fails to pay I will not remit the penalty
for at least 12 months.
THE WORST OFFENCE OF ALL.
A man described as a farmer was put forward on
a charge of failing to supply milk at 2d. a quart.
The President: Well, what have you to say?
Defendant: Your Excellency, I had 17 cows. They
were giving only 24 quarts a day, which meant 45.,
and as their food was runnin’ me into 12s. 6d. I
sold ’em for ss. 6d., and had no milk to dispose of.
The price is
The President: You belong to that contemptible
class who would in the midst of a great crisis ex-
ploit the public through withholding your labor from
cow-milking. You are an industrial Siiylock. You
are sentenced to imprisonment for six months. The
Committee is determined to provide the people with
cheap milk.
The Orderly: But there is no milk to be got.
The President: No matter! Exploitation is not to
be tolerated. We must have conscription of milk.
COMMITTEE PROCEEDINGS.
Later in the day it was announced that the wages
would be increased in all industries by 75 per cent.,
and the price of cabbages, cream of tartar, crepe de
chine, ham, eggs and butter would be reduced 90
per cent. The reward for discovery of synthetic
mutton was increased by £1 ss. 6d., and the fees
payable to members of the Committee of Public
Safety advanced from £5 ss. to £lO 10s., with an
additional £1 Is. 7d. in case of absence and 2s. 6d.
for making a patriotic speech.
Unhappy Jack.
The loss of two seats —Roebourne, whose
Labor representative off the Westra-
lian landscape, and Williams-Narrogin,
which Bertie Johnston won again an
Independent —has placed the Scaddan Gov-
ernment in a tight corner. The accident of
Parliament being in recess is hardly ad-
equate excuse for the Government carrying
on while its pledged supporters number two
less than a combination of the Liberals,
the Country Party and Bertie. Were
Happy Jack as poor a fighter as he is a
financier he would have shown the white
rag before this; but the Westralian Labor-
leader takes all the stings and arrows of
outraged opponents and supporters with un-
ruffled composure. He may plead that no
Government could be formed from the diverse
elements on the Opposition and cross
benches; but this merely postulates that the
electors should be given the earliest pos-
sible opportunity of straightening out the
tangle. There is certainly small prospect
of any workable coalition being formed as
the Assembly is now constituted. The mem-
bers of the Country Party, seven mediocri-
ties, look with a colder eye upon Opposition-
leader Wilson and ex-Lands Minister
Mitchell than they do upon Scaddan ;
and, anyway, they are under an iron pledge
to play a lone hand. Jimmy Gardiner, the
deposed Country Party leader, has always
exhibited a marked friendliness towards
the Labor Premier, but would decline to
be found either dead or alive in the same
paddock as Mitchell. Bertie Johnston’s
attitude in the event of a direct motion of
no confidence is uncertain. He claims still
to be faithful to the Labor platform, but
has declined emphatically to be associated
with an administration containing Premier
Scaddan and Lands Minister Johnson, to
whom, he infers, a fish-like smell attaches,
owing to their dealings with one Nevanas.
But the leader of the Independent Party of
one was once a civil servant for whom then
Lands Minister Mitchell had no use. Since
that day Bertie has shown to his late Min-
isterial boss the cordiality he no doubt feels
for a bubonic rat. A Liberal team could
hardly exclude Mitch Ell even to secure
Bertie’s vote, so it is difficult to say how
the Government would fare on a direct chal-
lenge. The probabilities are, however, that
if Scaddan elects to hold on to office and its
pecuniary compensations a dissolution will
be forced when Parliament meets. If this
happens the Labor Government will have a
ghastly record to carry before the constitu-
encies. It is convicted of stupidity, if noth-
ing worse, in connection with the Wyndham
meatworks contract, the powellising agree-
ment and the purchase of ships for the State
steamer service. The last-named venture has
produced nothing but heavy losses; the
State timber-mills are mostly closed down;
the agricultural implement works can be
spelt CHAOS, and other trading schemes
have contributed their quota to the deficit.
When Treasurer Scaddan took over the State
money-box he could rattle a surplus of
£13,000, the legacy from the Liberal Gov-
ernment. After less than five years’ admin-
istration the cash-box surrounds nothing
but air and a bad smell, and there is an
appalling accumulated deficit. Railway re-
ceipts for dragging the abundant harvest
will repair the ruin to some extent; on the
other hand, revenue has been swollen by
the simple device of lending the farmer loan
funds (at 6 per cent.) for the repayment
of his deferred rents and Agricultural Bank
indebtedness. It is true that the Labor
Government has had to weather one disas-
trous and one bad season; but instead of
economising where possible a mad-drunk
loan-scattering policy has marked the ad-
ministration from its first day. The crowd
which secures the job of cleaning up the
mess is not going to riot with beer and
skittles.

Something Better than “Business as
Usual.”
In Australia the calico sign, “Business as
usual,” was put up over the shop in a spirit
of emulation rather than as an indication
that we had any grasp of the situation ; for
few of our leaders have got beyond
the idea that an imitation of Britain is the
one safe course during the progress of the
big storm. But our position is wholly dif-
ferent from Britain’s. If Britain before the
war was not working up to the limit of her
natural resources, at any rate those resources
were not sufficiently elastic to be capable of
indefinite extension. Australia, on the
other hand, has barely touched the fringe of
her possibilities, and extension of business in
every direction is not only possible but
urgently necessary. While, therefore,
“Business as Usual” may represent the best
Britain can hope to achieve with natural
resources of a limited kind, Australia must
recognise that salvation can only come this
way by attempting a bigger and more pro-
gressive industrial programme than we had
formerly dreamed possible. At the outset of
our enlisting campaign 50,000 men looked
about our possible limit. Now we face the
raising of 300,000 without any special mis-
giving. Our industrial ideas are capable
of a similar enlargement if we can once
realise that the problem of the coming peace
may be just as acute as that of smashing
German and Turk. The War Census, which
was designed as a means of discovering the
fighting resources of the country might well
be followed by a Peace Census as a basis
for enlistment in a new campaign. On the
cards which each citizen might be asked to
fill up the questions should be asked of
every person with money to invest or special
knowledge to turn to account: (1) What
section of Australian industry he was pre-
pared to start or aid; (2) what assistance
he thought the Government might reasonably
give to insure the success of such industry;
(3) to what extent he was prepared to co-
operate with others in such industry if
assured of adequate protection and Govern-
ment aid. Other questions could be made
to apply to existing industries, to the draw-
backs under which they suffered and the
legislative means by which those drawbacks
could be removed. Then, the cards having
been tabulated and the information grouped
into convenient shape, the great industrial
enlistment campaign could begin. Groups
of would-be manufacturers could be brought
together, associated with those possessing
special knowledge, and under Government
pledges of adequate protection the wheels
could be set spinning with the least possible
delay. More than this, the Government
itself could suggest from the basis of the
returns profitable lines of manufacture
which would feed those industries otherwise
dependent upon overseas supplies. Such a
census would be as much in order as any
War Census; and on citizens of means being
unwilling to defend the industrial trenches
the Government has as good a right to ask
“Why not?” as in the case of the recruit
who hangs back. The fact that industrial
organisation of the kind on a national basis
has never been known before is no reason at
all why it should not be known now. The
young men of Australia to the number of at
least 300,000 are to take their part in and
share the sufferings of the great war; the
older men of Australia have again and again
assured them that they will keep the flag
flying at home and welcome them on their
return. As things are going those older
men are making no move to redeem their
promise. The scheme of a Peace Census as
a basis for “Business Unusual,” and the huge
industrial awakening which should follow,
would insure to the soldiers fighting their
country’s battles a return home to a land of
real prosperity and increasing trade activity.
Paying the Foreigner for his “Investi-
gations.”
This man knows what he is talking about:
A few more facts about the kindly way in which
we benighted Australians are treating the people of
countries who kill babies and massacre women.
Anton Breinl, an Austrian by birth, was brought
to this country by our Federal Government to show
us our own tropical diseases, which, by the way,
are hard to find. After our new-made foreign friend
had been searching for mosquitoes, bugs and other
crawling things for some months, he was given four
men, all with Australian degrees, to help him. Then
suddenly the European scrap started, and it was
found by those who cared to ask that Breinl had
naturalised himself hurriedly three months previ-
ously (May, 1914).
The period for which the Austrian Director of the
Australian Tropical Institute was appointed was due
to end in 1915, and the said director had told more
than one inhabitant that as he had learnt all Aus-
tralia could teach him he was not going to apply for
a renewal of his lease. However, the war made
things a bit awkward, and apparently having done
all that ought to have been done in tropical dis-
eases, this naturalised foreigner, who talks only
broken English, applied for and was appointed to
the Townsville hospital as house-surgeon. The other
applicant for the position was a Townsville-born resi-
dent with a mere Australian degree.
A highly-placed Federal official next got his friend
Breinl permission to take on the full-time appoint-
ment at the hospital as well as keeping the full-time
appointment at the Institue. The Direkter (that
sounds German) was not allowed to be paid for the
hospital work, but as he is drawing only £lOOO per
annum for the Federal appointment, at which he can
do as little as he likes, he is not on a bad wicket.
But steady! Wait a minute! Australia was not
content with conferring only one honor upon Anton
Breinl.
When Dr. Priestly, the present quarantine
officer of the port of Townsville, was having a jaunt
to Brisbane, Breinl, if you please, was appointed in
his place. Now, what happens? Why, an Austrian
is the first man to put foot on board any vessel
coming from foreign ports. If a British man-of-war
entered the port from overseas and required to be
inspected, this damned foreigner would be the man
to inspect her.
Giving this man a permit to go on board any ship
means so many things that I needn’t specify any of
them. But I don’t forget that a couple of Teutonic
scientists who were our friends and our guests at the
Science Congress took away as souvenirs a few
articles that they might just as well have left behind.
If the Townsville hospital people appointed this
alien because he cost them less money, then they are
merely the class of patriot who when the war is over
will send a large order for cheap goods to:—•
Merck & Co., Druggists,
Darmstadt, Germany.
Thing's that the man who is sitting in a wet trench
would like to know are: —
(1) Why am I fighting to keep this Austrian in
a comfortable billet?
(2) What was the hurried naturalisation for?
(3) Isn’t it just possible that some work must be
left undone if the one man holds two full-time jobs
and one part-time job?
(4) If there is not enough work at the Institute
to keep him occupied, why is he getting £lOOO per
year ?
(5) If the man is what the Government wants for
tropical diseases, why is he not kept at the job
instead of being let play round with Australian hos-
pitals and anybody’s ships?
(6) Why isn’t a decent Australian put into his
apparently very soft billet of £lOOO a year?
(7) As Anton Breinl, of the University of
Prague, wanted to get away in 1915, but was stopped
by the- war, is he not surely just making a
convenience of our Federal Government, and will
he not as soon as peace is declared shake Australian
microbes from his coat-tails?
(8) Is it not possible that Australia is merely
paying a foreigner to get inside knowledge of Aus-
tralia for the benefit of people outside Australia,
and is it not, therefore, eminently desirable that this
scientific invlestigation shall be handed to Aus-
tralians, who will be likely to remain and yield up
all the results for the benefit of Australia?
Putting the Bricks in the Wrong Place.
The new buildings or additions to old build-
ings in and around Sydney last year cost
over £5,000,000. It is a tidy sum for 12
months of war, and indicates the tremendous
hold which the congestionist policy has on
the State. Decentralisation has been a
plank of practically all the political plat-
forms nailed together in N.S.W. for years
past; but it is a plank which, for all the
meaning it possesses, might as well be
chopped up for firewood. The Holman
crowd a year or two back professed to be
keen on opening ports north and south of
Port Jackson ; but their zeal took the form
of duplicating the existing railways to Syd-
ney at a greater cost than the construction
of several railways to natural deep-sea ports
would have involved. So the State remains
in the position of a huge department store
with only one small door on the street-level,
and the managers of the concern fancy that
by making additional staircases everything
will be put right. The frontage is large;
the number of possible doors is considerable ;
yet the same old policy of jambing all trade
through the one entrance is cheerfully main-
tained. The trouble is not that the
politicians can’t see the advantages of mak-
ing more street openings. The reason the
crowd is forced to enter in one packed mob
is that that plan has been found to best suit
certain gangs of pickpockets near the single
entrance, and these pickpockets have the poli-
ticians completely under their control. In
Sydney, under the guise of agents or financiers
of various sorts, a number of people take
toll of all that comes and goes through the
city gate. Of course, most of them carry
on business in quite a lawful way; but
that it is lawful does not alter the fact
that the public’s purse is picked. The
£5,000,000 just spent on buildings alone
represents part of this toll; for that big
wad of cash must all sooner or later be
paid by the trade of the State through which
the city exists. If that money had been
spent, say, at Port Stephens it would have
provided sufficient railway facilities, wharf-
age, streets, shops and houses to last for
years ; and the relief of rolling stock through
the shorter haulage from the North and
North-west would have been almost sufficient
to enable the railways to cope with ordi-
nary demands in ordinary seasons. Yet the
folly of putting all the bricks in one heap
goes on, and N. S. Wales loses enough power
from the State machine to build a new city
every year.

The protest of the that the decision
of the N. S. Wales Education Department to
appoint three or four more doctors will
have a prejudicial effect on the earnings of
outside doctors, looks like speaking in a
hurry. It seems more probable that the
spread of information regarding the pre-
sence and consequences of physical defects
in children will result in widening the de-
mand for medical treatment. Broadly speak-
ing it is among the children of parents who
are either naturally or by force of circum-
stance careless of their youngsters’ welfare
and especially among children living in
the more remote parts—that the principal
work of these departmental officers would
rest. It is not a question of pauperising
the children of people able to pay for advice,
The Road of Lots of Time.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
So young the day, so light the winds with
laughter.
We went with careless steps along the steep.
Long were the hours, and rich to follow
after,
Ere bell and star-set called the world to
sleep.
So much to do, yet time enough to do it;
We made each cameo plan a clear-cut gem.
The road was long, the rose-leaves to
bestrew it
Were in the bud and nodded on the stem.
Our fellow-travellers laughed so well to find
us
One with themselves in that far-reaching
view ;
The goal was sure, no summer mis(s could
blind us
To all we hoped and all we meant to do.
The milestones fled. The sun above us
shining
Made merry as he climbed the topmost noon ;
Often we paused, on banks of green reclin-
m ing ’
To hear some wayside fiddler’s passing tune.
Still there was time enough before the dark-
ness ;
Our plans grew larger, bolder as we went.
Till the long mountain shadows in their
starkness
Told us the afternoon was nearly spent.
Then to the task, long dreamed, we set our
fingers,
Feverish, eager, resolute of will.
To find with sinking hearts that he who
lingers
Too long with fancy loses strength and skill.
The work remains undone, for all our striv-
ing,
The shadows thicken and the night creeps
down,
While hand and brain are busy still contriv-
ing
New snares to catch one leaf from the lost
crown.
Then Time’s inexorable boot behind us
Lands the last ruthless kick as twilight falls.
Leaving the ravelled threads of deeds behind
us,
Lights of old visions, echoes of old calls.
And, as we pass, new throngs, with careless
laughter,
Take up the lilt of our forgotten rhyme :
The day is long, the rich hours follow after,
The sun is bright, and we have lots of time.

but of protecting the offspring of parents
who would generally let things go, and on
such an issue the duty of the State is un-
mistakable. A big question concerning the
place of the medical profession in relation
to society is coming up for settlement some
day, and big men will be wanted to handle
it. But Griffith, who has to deal with
this threat of the doctors’ union to boycott
the appointees, ought to be equal to the job
of asserting public rights as against the

Redemption by the Grace of Bill.
That partnership between the Almighty
and the Kaiser had to come to an end. the
position of junior in the firm being one that
had certain anomalies. Therefore it is the
blood-stained William who is now alone
being referred to as the Redeemer. The title
is conferred by Ferdinand of Bulgaria, who,
having got the tip in advance, has announced
that Wilhelm is going to dispense “pros-
perity and salvation.” As the Hun has up
to the present been serving out slaughter,
arson, rape and general abomination, the new
performance seems likely to be attended with
difficulties. Meanwhile, its ownership of a
Redeemer with a withered arm and a sore
throat and a horrible past makes
Ivultur something the rest of the world
should be less anxious to sample than
ever. Of the war itself little has been
heard lately except vague reports of advances
by the Russians, of an attack being imminent
on Salonica, and of attempts being made to
relieve the hard-pressed Anglo-Indian army
in Mesopotamia. These are in the main
slightly encouraging, but there is evidently
something wrong with the arrangements to
hold the Austrian off the eastern Adriatic
littoral. Exactly what is the matter there
is wrapped in the usual obscurity, though
there is not much reason to doubt that
the Montenegrins are finding their country
an increasingly unpleasant place to inhabit.
Where our own lads are is more or less
doubtful. Some may be at Salonica and
others along the Suez Canal. Either place
will probably be more cheerful than their
last address. The job of getting more of
them where they are wanted goes forward
from day to day here in Australia to the
accompaniment of much talk and laborious
effort and waste of time. And as men are
wanted now quite as urgently as ever, and
as without them the war cannot be won. this
enlightened method of getting them is fully
entitled to continued disrespect. Pending
whatever is going to happen next, the Censor
arrives at his office every morning, booted
and spurred, and ready to issue commands.
He is doing great work nowadays. If Britain
doesn r t pay him Germany certainly should.

of the stomach-pickles, is a preparation of
acetic and salicylic acids. The name being
the private property of a German of Ham-

must be called by its true name, aceto-

Every day I’m told, in effect, that it is a
dishonest colonial imitation sold for extra

This week N. S. Wales celebrates the fact
that the First Fleet had enough horse sense
to leave Botany Bay and look for a decent
port. The pool of water at La Perouse
didn’t satisfy the pioneers of settlement, and
without much trouble they found the better
harbor of Port Jackson. If our remem-
brance of this feat is worth a public holiday
it must be because we have some sort of
admiration for it, and the proper way to
celebrate the event is to go and do likewise.
Sydney Harbor in 1916 is every way as
unsuited to carry the whole oi a State’s
overseas trade as Botany Bay was to carry
its pioneer expedition. So the proper way
to show our appreciation of the common-
sense of Phillip is to equip an expedition
and go and look for another port to relieve
the congestion of Sydney. Of course there
are plenty of other suitable ports well known
to the school kid who learns local geo-
graphy; but none seems to come within the.
alleged vision of our political leaders. A
voyage of discovery solemnly repeated every
year might at last convince a Government
pledged to decentralisation that Sydney was
not the final word in coastal towns. At any
rate it would emphasise the fact that in
bygone years people could do simple things
like finding a fresh' place to sit down on
without spending a quarter of a century
in the consideration of the tremendous
problem.
Norman Lindsay is seeing a younger
brother off to the Front, and his usual place

Jack Flanagan. Turn back to the front-page
drawing, and marvel, not at the conception
and the draughtsmanship, which are remark-
able enough, but at the fact that it is all the
work of a student of 21. So far he has not
developed a technique of his own: but he
has the imagination and the skill to go
almost any distance in his profession, if he
joins hard work with his other gifts.

What happened to Mary? No; it wasn’t
that! Bert Bailey’s play at the Royal,
produced last Saturday, is a play fit for an
archbishop. There are two beds in it, cer-
tainly; but they are not twin beds, and the
audience is not allowed to see either. This
is the Other Sort of American comedy—the
in-no-cent heroine, the lost che-ild, the
wicked seducer, the cross lawyer with the
heart of gold, the “loud” but loving oyster-
dredger, the seduced stenographer, the
stolen purse—“ She took it, I saw her!” —
the legal baby-stealing villain, the distressed
mother, and the comic “old salt” with only
one leg but a heart with bumps of benevo-
lence all over it. The moral is that if a
young, inexperienced village girl is only
sufficiently in-no-cent, she will emerge tri-
umphant from the temptations and the
villainies of New York. But the plot does
not greatly matter: it has been written so
often. A conventional comedy, it will still
afford a pleasant evening’s entertainment to
all those who are weary of the American
crook and are tired of twin beds and semi-
attached bungalows.
* * * *
The company recruited on our selection
proves itself at home in “What Happened
to Mary”—with, of course, the inevitable
regret that it should ever have to find a
successor to its original success. Bert
Bailey’s Cap’n Jogifer is a joy, but, after
his Dad, a mitigated joy. His kindly old
seaman is the triumph of the production; his
quiet characterisation is all the more effec-
tive because Bert Bailey resists the tempta-
tion to over-play a part that in other hands
would be made an excuse for disorganising
the scheme of the comedy. Lesley Adrienne
is sufficiently innocent as the ingenuous and
vice-proof Mary; but her diction is mono-
tonous and her personality too slight for
her occasional dramatic moments. Fred
Macdonald, as the hopeless oyster dredger,
happily reminded the audience of Dave; but
the author, Owen Davis, has not given him
the opportunities to make his Tuck Winter-
green anything but a caricature. J. B.
Fowler’s conception of a lodger is horribly
like the sort of lodger we know. Laura
Roberts steps from the broad comedy of the
selection to the tears and terrors of a de-
ceived girl, and gives the part its full
theatrical importance. Guy Hastings is

The Bulletin critic introduces his neu-
tral curate to the Intellectual Drama:—
The curate was staying with me. For one thing,
it was cheaper than a coffee-palace. He had come
from Adelaide, where the Repertory Drama rages.
He confessed that he had got quite a lot of moral
uplift out of that sort of drama. But he naturally
desired to see the Real Thing done by Real Actors
and (under his breath) by Real Actresses. Of
course, he would not go to—er “Twin Sofas,
though he thanked the Archbishop for having
pointed out the posters to him. You didn t have to
pay to see the posters, and since the Rev. Hugh

Ward had mentioned that the posters were the
best part of the show, my curate considered it
would be a waste of time for a sincere student of
the Intellectual Drama to investigate the play it-
self. So 1 took him to another play. I explained
to him that the Rev. Hugh Ward —or was it the
Rev Hugh Claude? —had discovered and selected
this play as the finest example of the Intellectual
Drama of a great and peace-loving State. My
curate was delighted with the first scene, and
chiefly with the dark-eyed gay little girl in pink
on the prompt side. He thought the costumes
worn by the ladies were so sensible for the sea-
side and a grave protest against the sin of over-
dressing. The bare knees of the girls looked delici-
ously cool, though he was rather surprised that the
girls should expose so ugly a part of their anatomy
when, he . understood, there were other parts that
might prove more beautiful. I advised him to wait.
As the evening wore on less would be worn. The
bare-back ballet reminded him of a butcher’s shop.
He said that the idea of representing the hanging
carcases of shoulders of mutton by this human
means was a delightful example of the Higher
Symbolism, though it inculcated a grim warning
against marriage. He had often trifled with the
idea of marriage; but the sight of those muscular
shoulders of human mutton would, he believed,
save him.

Being a Good Patriot —he had often spoken
earnestly at recruiting meetings—he was pleased
to find so many young male choristers on
the stage. The superabundance of bright young
men busily engaged in waving their hands and
waggling their feet proved that there was no need
for Conscription. The Rev. Hugh Ward, being a
Good Australian or a Good Neutral—he wasn’t
sure which, but doubtless they both meant the same
thing—would not engage these young men to dance
if there were not plenty of other men eager to fight
for their country. My curate was, however, a little
worried over Connie Ediss. During the first act
he was afraid that she would lose her voice; and
during the second act he was afraid she wouldn’t.
Of Charles H. Workman he asked anxiously whether
he was meant to be funny. I assured him that
that was what he was paid for, and the Rev. Hugh
Claude wasn’t likely to pay away good Australian
money for nothing. This satisfied my curate.
Dorothy Brunton he liked. He said that she was
just the sort of girl to make a curate’s wife, and
if it had not been for that shocking exposure of the
Shoulder-of-Mutton Ballet he would have asked me
to introduce him to her. He wanted to know what
Marie Eaton was singing about on the numerous
occasions when she energetically made pleasant
noises. I explained that it did not matter. She
was only there to give the audience time to pick
out the dark-eyed little girl in another costume or
wonder whether that fair girl would unfix her
heroic smile. But as the plot unfolded my curate
began to wriggle. Furtively he glanced at his
programme, and there read the words “Twin Bun-
galows.” “I say,” he whispered, “haven’t we come
to the wrong theatre?” I assured him that, though
no doubt the twin bungalows contained twin beds,
I thought tqo highly of the Rev. Hugh Ward to
imagine that he would allow us to see those dread-
ful articles of unattire. All the same, my curate
had a dark suspicion that those twin beds had to
be made every morning of the week. And I had to
agree with my friend that the author of the play
had done little to disperse this dreadful suspicion.
However, my curate said that he thoroughly-
approved of the Higher Drama, though the most
interesting part of it was in the bare lower base-
ment.

from the front of Her Majesty’s (Sydney)

“Dick Whittington” has run into a second
edition at Sydney Adelphi; some new and
attractive items have been added to the

edies, light operas and revues on Sydney
theatregoers, so those who have not yet
called upon the Lord Mayor of the Adelphi

versity, the Public Library, the choir-loft and

“The Spoilers,” by Rex Beach, a brisk
story of rough-and-ready Canadian life, is
not making George Marlow any poorer at
the Palace (Sydney). The popularity of
Ethel Buckley has had more than a fraction
to do with the success of the piece; but,
apart from that, “The Spoilers” is the kind
of dramatic goods a very large section of the
public have a weakness for, and they are
rolling up to indulge it.
The Shakspeare season at Melbourne Prin-
cess’s got a hearty reception despite the sul-
try heat of Saturday night. Evidently George
Marlow made no mistake in introducing
Allan Wilkie to Melbourne as a producer of
poetic drama at popular prices. “The Mer-
chant of Venice” proves him to be an
artistic manager and a scholarly actor with
a strong personality. The Merchant, it is
true, has never been a very popular success
hereabouts, but it appeals to intelligent
theatregoers as a famous character-play, and
they will say that the present performance,
although not so fully equipped as Oscar
Asche’s, is more interesting than some pre-
vious revivals which came more expensive to
the audience. Scene-painter Robin’s and the
stage-carpenter have put in good work ; the
dresses are harmonious, even in their gaudi-
est colors; and. though the production is
necessarily condensed to suit the tariff, and
though the first two acts are almost confined
to one scene, the audience gets some whiffs
of Venetian atmosphere and suggestions of a
bygone age.

ated. This is a dignified Hebrew drawn on
Irvingesque lines, and passionate only when
he talks of his race and of the Christians
who expectorate on his whiskers. On Jessica
he wastes no affection. He is the stern
parent who reckons that all girls want
watching. His acting is unequal in strength
and his voice is variable, as though he were
sometimes imitating another Shylock. Never-
theless he is convincing in most parts, and
picturesque always. Marcus St. John is a
well-spoken, dignified Prince of Morocco,
whilst impressive John Cosgrove, in the
aldermanic robes of Antonio, carries so much
flesh on his chest that he ought to willingly
lose a pound of it. Bassanio is a nice, quiet
young fortune-hunter who hardly deserves
his good luck. The tall Lorenzo’s delivery of
Shakspeare’s immortal lines is hampered by
a slight lisp. Robert Faulkner is Gratiano.
and allows his skipping spirit too much rope
in the trial scene, but is otherwise commend-
able. Launcelot Gobbo follows the ancient
custom of talking to the audience when he
is supposed to be talking to himself. Miss
Valentine Sidney presents Nerissa as a sport-
ive young woman, and Miss Elwyn Harvey
brings a glad eye and a feeble elocution to
the part of Miss Shylock, who elopes with
Lorenzo in a gondola. The Portia of Miss
Hunter-Watts seems merely a pleasing bru-
nette qualified to shine at a charity bazaar.
Her style is essentially modern and her
casual, flippant manner in the trial scene is
excusable only on the supposition that she
knows from the start that Shylock has not
Buckley’s chance of getting his knife into
Antonio—which is a quite reasonable sup-
position when you come to think about it-
Even the silly old Doge must have known
that the laws of Venice did not give the peti-
tioner a hope.

of farce. There are certainly humorous pos-
sibilities about the notion of an idle Johnny
chaperoning an elderly philanderer at a little
dinner, but the subsequent complications
somewhat fail to realise the joyous promise
of the opening scene. Shelford as the
chaperon gets most merriment out of the
joke by pretending to be the husband of the
lady in the case when Frank Bradley, the
aforesaid Lothario, is suddenly confronted
bv his respectable relatives. Shelford never
falters in his assumed gallantry to his bogus
spouse or slackens in the task of bluffing the
flinty Miss Maxwell into a less suspicious
frame of mind. Miss Florence Fanning as
the Maxwell female has the job of scenting
scandal from afar with upheld lorgnette and
dilated nostrils, and her conception of the
spinster leaves very little vinegar to be
desired. As the actress who causes all the
trouble, Miss Ethel Dane is an occasional
reminder of what she was before, but for
the most part she is only a burst of melo-
dious hysterics at the prospect of appearing
as Mrs.* Shelford and carrying the deception
overnight. Bradley is admirable in the
attitudes and beatitudes of a giddy old
boy, but Ford is only a flicker of
his former self in an inconspicuous minor
part. Miss Hellmrich, as Bradley’s wife, is
placid and unruffled in situations which usu-
ally call for some feminine emotion, whilst
Edward Landor. playing an old sea-dog,
gives the role the requisite bark and bite.

The panto, continues to glitter in modera-
tion at Her Majesty’s (Melbourne). No
drastic measures have been applied to the
dull sections of “Mother Goose.” The
comedians, with the exception of the pawky
laird (Heaven knows what “pawky” means,
hut it sounds suitable), are still addicted to
failing violently upon the floor for the pur-
pose of appearing humorous, and the enun-
ciation of the tall “principal boy” continues
to be faulty. But the horse is still a re-
deeming circumstance, and the ballet and
chorus abound in legs and other good points,
and there are bits of Coleman’s scene-paint-
in? that are a joy to this journal’s jaded eye.

At Melbourne Royal the noisy horrors of
war drama will give place to something to
larf about next Saturday night. Hale Ham-
ilton and others of the “Twin Beds” Co.
from Sydney will open in “It Pays to Adver-

forthcoming American comedy is farcical,
and the Williamson firm is paying to adver-

to set the public “quaking” with glee. Mean-
while the German spy will be buried in the
ruins of trench 27 for two more nights, and
the surviving victims of the bomb explosion
will suffer together in the last act of “Under
Fire” as before.

AT POVERTY POINT.
“Kaniva” : One of my treasures is a pro-
gramme . of the first performance in which
G. S. Titheradge appeared in Melbourne. It
was at the Academy of Music (Bijou), in
Bourke-street, on May 24, 1879, as Lord
Arthur Chilton, in “False Shame.” Alma
Santon, J. L. Hall, Herbert Flemming and
Oily Deering were in the company. Later,
at the same theatre, he played Jacob
McClosky in “The Octoroon”; and in the
same year, with Adelaide Bowring as Louise,
he was Old Tom in “London by Night.” The
first playbill recorded the fact that “George
Sutton Titheradge was selected as Herald
to publicly proclaim Queen Victoria as the
Empress of India, at Calcutta, on June 1,
1877.” Two years later he was able to pro-
claim himself one of the finest actors Aus-
tralia had known.
George Titheradge had quite an old-fash-
ioned family of six daughters and one son.
Three of the girls and the boy are on the
stage; but the boy promises to do better
a writer of plays than as an actor of them.
He is in the U.S.A.
“Fax” : Melbourne biographies of the late
George Musgrove are mostly inaccurate at
the outset. They represent him as having
been the author of his own theatrical for-
tunes, whereas his uncle, William Saurin
Lyster, gave him his start in the business,
and circumstances made his fortune for him
when he was a young fellow of 26. George
began as a boy-usher in his uncle’s theatre.
He was promoted to the office, and was next
entrusted with the job of going to England
to look after the comic opera co. that uncle
was prepared to engage. Having collected
the co. he came with the crowd to Australia ;
but at the first port they touched they met
the news that manager \Y. S. Lyster was
dead! The show had to be financed
somehow, and George Musgrove, of course,
got the fixing up of the syndicate. This
“Tambour Major” co. proved an enormous
success from the jump, and most of the profits
that would have gone to uncle Lyster fell
to the nephew, forced thus to provide an
emergency management as soon as he
reached Melbourne. That story of George
Musgrove’s first theatrical enterprise is one
of the romances of the stage.
“Kaniva” : There will be fierce disputation
over the manner in which George Musgrove
got his start. What is certain is that Uncle
Lyster, being himself in bad health, sent the
young man to Europe and gave him a free
hand to bring out an opera co. The profes-
sion has never been able to return a verdict
as to whether Musgrove played the game or
not. His friends say that, Lyster dying,
Musgrove took the whole thing over. The
others allege that on the way out Musgrove
met a moneyed man who offered to finance
the show, and that lie leaped at the chance
to become a manager. Lyster, according to
this version, never recovered the stock, and
died a few days before the notable produc-
tion of “Tambour Major,” which ran in
Melbourne 101 nights.
In South Head Cemetery, on the ocean
fringe of Sydney, George Musgrove lies be-
side his mother, who died last year, aged
85 years. She was sister of Georgia Ilodson,
wife of W. S. Lyster, the operatic manager
of the ’6o’s and ’7o’s who gave George his
start.
“Iris”: Aggie Thorne (Mrs. Arthur
Deery, heigho !), who went off with the Fred
Niblos to make her fortune on the American
stage, is back again in Melbourne. She has
gone into partnership with a girl who can
trim hats and carve blouses, and they are
now millining in Collins-street.
Two dramatic companies took their last
curtain-calls this month. Allan Doone’s
people went their respective ways, while
Julius Knight’s dramatic co. came to an end
at the Melbourne Princess’s. Some 30-odd
people have ceased to use greasepaint
through the companies disbanding.
The Adelaide Tivoli is now but a few
heaps of rubbish. The old place has had a
chequered history, being originally White’s
Rooms and Adelaide’s chief place of meet-
ing for dance or “assembly.” Then Arthur
Garner took it over —before he was with
Williamson and Musgrove—-and called it
Garner’s Rooms. Tommy Hudson converted
it to Variety as the Bijou Theatre, and
Rickards continued the same thing on a
bigger scale, calling it the Tivoli. Finally
Mclntosh took that name along to a hand-
some new house away in Grote-street, and
for what remained of his lease let it for
pictures, as the Star. Tolley and Co., the
owners, are now £oing to build a really up-
to-date Majestic on what is probably the
best site in the city, and the Clarence
Hotel, which occupies most of the frontage
to King William-street, is to be improved
out of all knowledge.
Harrison O.” autobiographically :
My thanks to “Ninety Years Old” (B. 6/l/’l6) for
having brought portion of my record under public
notice. 1o an old actor, critic and entrepreneur like
myself it is naturally gratifying to know that in
these days of bad acting and worse plays the (if
1 may say so) giants of the past are not entirely for-
gotten. lour contributor docs not, I know, claim that
his biography of me is complete, but some of the
omissions are, I think, somewhat notable. The state-
ment that 1 played Hamlet in London in 1874 is
correct, but I was then a man of 31, and had, as a
matter of fact, represented the immortal Dane 17
years previously at Manchester, at the age of 14,
when I was received by the critics with that kind-
ness which has always been my lot at their hands.
For several years following this triumph I vanished
from the public eye; the reason being that when a
lad of 15 I formed a friendship with De Quincey,
for whom the tomb was then almost ripe, who intro-
duced me to the opium habit. For some years I was
a slave to this vice, but at length conquered it. My

next public appearance was in the notorious court
ease with which my name is, alas! associated. For
months I was the subject of cruel gibes and disgust-
ing jests in the gutter press of London, and, as the
world knows, a British jury found me guilty of the
infamous charges brought against me. 1 have never
ceased to protest my innocence, and, happily, Time
—that merciful healer of the afflicted—has deadened
the hurt and won from me forgiveness for the woman
who thus early attempted to wreck my career. She,
poor creature! has been punished, having married a
prominent Plymouth Brother. ' My friendship with
ltuskin, to which your contributor refers, was of long
standing, and ended only with lt.’s death. Although
under obligations to me in the early days of his
career, Jack subsequently repaid me with interest by
the help ha gave one who, although .my senior in
years, was—l think I may claim —a protege of mine.
I refer, of course, to Turner, whose paintings I
brought under his notice. My association with the
Irish Dramatic Movement and the Icelandic Musical
Revival may pass; but,, in fairness to myself, I think
I should mention thait what should have proved my
greatest service to dramatic art came to nought
through no fault of mine. Bernard Shaw and myself,
after many consultations, came to an arrangement to
visit Paris and murder Viotorien Sardou. The plot
was skilfully laid, but the gay spirit of Paris proved
too much for Shaw, who devoted the whole of his
time to the worst debaucheries of the vegetarian
cult, and was in no condition to carry out his share
of our mission. I may also mention that I did my
best to dissuade Pinero from becoming a dramatist;
so I accept no responsibility for the machine-made
problem play which has helped to make the British
stage ridiculous. My old friend “Mid-Channel,” who
at the time was a scene-shifter at the Court Theatre,
was present on one occasion, and will probably re-
member how I advised Pinero to give up playwriting
and go in for the breeding of homing pigeons. Of
late years I have devoted myself to coaching reper-
tory actors, friends of my young friend Hugh McCrae,
in the “art which conceals art,” and, as a tribute to
my coaching, I may mention that some of them are
able to conceal their art so effectively that many in
the audience are not even aware that they have it with
them on the stage. Apart from this and the secret
poisoning of several American mummers, I have in
my old age contented myself with—as your contribu-
tor puts it—“giving Australia the benefit” of my
“enormous experience” in the columns of your
esteemed journal.
“Rab Cilbup”: How long are Sydney
audiences going to put up with the execrable
seating of Sydney theatres? In the majority
of them the seats are built on two assump-
tions: that people have (1) no legs and
(2) only one arm. A person who makes
his way to a seat in the middle of a block
has either to smash through a tangle of
legs or ask the persons already seated to
stand and lift their seats. And though
arms are provided for the seats there are
only two available for each two occupants —-
one apiece. People usually come to the
theatre with hats ; but either the hats must
be mixed up with the feet of the people be-
hind or precariously hung on the seats in
front, there to be squashed flat, as the other
people hack their way through. The trouble
is due to the fact that there is no competi-
tion in theatres. Look at the kinema
theatres, where there is competition. There,
though there is still economy of knee-space,
some effort is made to provide up-to-date
and comfortable seats. The most adequate
and artistically designed theatre in Sydney
is a moving-picture house in little suburban
Mosman. Hugh AVard might get a few
ideas in theatre-design—that he didn’t get
in the U.S.A. —by a visit there.
“Jwosp”: “Kaniva” (I>. 16/12/M5) and
others talk of “Paul Jones” but don’t men-
tion Maude Beatty, who was a handsome
and tuneful Paul with the Pollard produc-
tion. She played Paul when a girl and when
a woman, and if you dare tell a Maori-
lander that there is or ever has been a
better Jones, you can look for trouble.
Maude is now in America, playing leads in
one of John Cort’s musical comedy shows.
“F.II.”: Monte Luke, the Melbourne
camera-man whose up-to-the-minute photo-
graphs of theatrical celebrities are now
known all over Australia, has only
lately taken to the business as a
serious way to a crust. His father is
Edmund Luke, who for many years has
snapped the passing show for the Leader,
and the younger Luke imbibed a knowledge
of picture-values as an accidental part of
his education. His first attempt at mak-
ing a mark was on the stage, and he had a
few minor parts in Julius Knight produc-
tions. Later he went afield with Ethel
Irving’s company, persistently attempting to
make bricks without straw—the straw being-
vocal cords in liis case. The inadequacy of
his voice pushed him out in the end.
“Steele Rudd”: I have been listening to
the argument between “Mid-channel” and
“Ho Ho,” into which they’ve dragged “On
Our Selection,” and I would like to ask “Ho
IIo” a question. When he states that “the
big managements know the pulse of the pub-
lip well enough to leave this sort of business
(‘On Our Selection’) to others,” does he
refer to the J.C.W. firm? If yes, then I
wish to say that I have a small packet of
letters from the late J.C.W. in which he
wrote things about. Dad and co. that would
make me blush to print, and urged me to try
my hand on a dramatic version for his firm,
I submitted him a draft version for con-
sideration. But he shook his head at it
and advised me to collaborate with someone
who knew “all about stagecraft.” I sug-
gested that he himself collaborate with me
in the good work ; but he couldn’t have been
looking for a job, and mentioned the name
of his secretary. And the sec. got in touch
with me, and I got in touch with him, and
we both got in touch with each other,
f inally I generously agreed to give him for
his part in the prospective version a full
half-share of the royalties. He agreed to
g° ahead —and didn't. Consequently the
J.C.AA . firm didn’t get “On Our Selection.”
But it wasn’t because it didn’t ask for it, or
didn’t want “that sort of play.”
The latest “Australian actress” to be
boomed and pictured in London is Irene
'V'V'vne. She is to be the leading lady in
'\ ho Is He?” which is to succeed the long-
running ‘Quinneys” at the Ilaymarket. The
piece is being strikingly advertised by the
picture of a mysterious-looking person in
a slouch hat and the lower part of his face
murned. Only a pair of penetrating eyes
afford any clue to his identity. He is the
hero; Irene is the heroine.

The curtain fell, and the Big Chief stood
And glared around the stage,
And the mummers knew that he looked for blood,
And they feared his noble rage.

“Who damned my greatest scene?”
Then forth a trembling super crawled,
With his face a sickly green.

Then the super wailed: “Please sir, my cue—

I watched most carefully,
And I always came when I heard you say
The proper cue for me.

To clear his mind of carnal doubt.

Much fairer than this mundane sphere,
A land of golden streets, and he
Still turned an interested ear.
A fine production he could see.
Stage-managed well, he had no fear,
’1 would offer him a great career.

About the seat of majesty.

SOCIETY
“Bill O’Costs” demands a reform: —
Samuel James Way, Bart., Chief Justice, Privy
Councillor, Lieutenant-Governor, Chancellor of This,
President of That, now resting from his multifarious
dignities, would have made an ideal Minister for
Compliments, an officer whose appointment I advo-
cated. in The Bulletin some time ago. He loved
more than anything the glitter of titular distinc-
tion, and let no opportunity pass to unctuously
accord to anyone every scrap of tag to which he was
entitled, with a bit over. It was always a safe
“leg-pull” to quote to him some eminent Judge,
without the authorised handle to the name. “This,
y'r Honor, is a judgment of Cairns.” Promptly
would come, “Ah, yes. Lord Cairns. I once had
the distinguished honor of meeting him.” And
when he dealt in complimentary adjectives the ordi-
nary superlatives became lagging also-rans. A dona-
tion to anything was “unexampled munificence,” and
a speech became “a masterpiece of oratorical splen-
dor.” He died as he lived, and the elaborate State
funeral that honored him was precisely as the little
man would have liked to arrange it himself. Indeed,
to a large extent, he did arrange it! If there was
a sigh left in the energetic old body it must have
been one of satisfaction with the concourse of Gover-
nors, Premiers, professors, politicians, parsons, law-
yers, bailiffs, Masons, Methodists, Oddfellows and
outcasts in the right order of precedence. But this
very function serves as a telling illustration of the
need for the new Minister mentioned —an official
whose job it should be to deliver the appropriate
expressions of rejoicing, grief, congratulation or
commiseration upon all public occasions, from the
marriage of a prince to the obsequies of an aider-
man. Just observe what happened in this case.
The G.-G. telegraphed his condolences to the State
Gov., the State Gov. sent his to the Premier, the
High Commissioner cablet! to the Prime Minister, the
Federal Attorney-General wired the State ditto, the
Mayor of Wallaroo did the same to the City Mayor,
the Metholean Chief Pot to his Adelaide berruther,
the Pre-eminent Grand Druid of Oodnadatta to the
Right Worthy of the same, and the Chairman of
the Para Wirra District Council to any old function-
ary willing to take delivery of the wire. All these
were, be it noted, not condolences of the personal
kind. Those were pardonable enough, though the
dead C.J. was an elderly, childless widower. But
think for a moment of the prodigious waste of
money, time and language in the unnecessary part of
all this—the cabling and telegraphing of officials,
anybodies and nobodies to one another, the acknow-
ledgment of it all to follow, and the speeches, dupli-
cated and reduplicated unto seventy times seven ; and
all avoidable by a simple experiment in organisation!

Will Dyson does not find that Australia’s
glory in Gallipoli has greatly irradiated
the fog of English ignorance. His friend
Cyrus Cuneo, the well-known illustrator,
was waited upon by a recruiting sergeant at
Chelsea. “But, my friend, 1 am an Ameri-
can citizen,” said the artist. “Blesh yer
’eart, sir, that’s nothin’,” replied the ser-
geant. “We’re takin’ all sorts —even Aus-
tralians.”
“F.L.K.”: There is nothing like having
everything in order. In October, 1914. my
brother, a quarter-master sergeant, went in-
to khaki, and after rushing at the Turk until
August was carried off to London for re-
pairs. A week or two ago a card arrived
asking him if he was prepared to enlist, and
if not, why not? Whereupon I loyally sup-
plied Red Tape with the facts, and asked
it if it had heard there was a war threaten-
ing in Europe. I thought it was only a
friendly thing to let ’em know my suspicions.

When the Melbourne police gathered up
John Jackson after their fight with John and
a couple of his mates who were breaking
into the Trades Hall a few months ago, they
charged him with murdering a constable
named McGrath and called in a surgeon to
mend his broken leg. While the Crown paid
a surgeon to repair that damage it paid a
lawyer to seek authority to inflict more
damage, the result being that the Bench told
Jackson he would be hanged. Consequently
the mending of Jackson's leg was interrupted
on Monday, when another sort of practi-
tioner got to work and broke his neck. And
after all this breaking things were just as
they were before, except that two men were
dead instead of one.

improvement in the tests followed. Inciden-

Cairo recently where, on the archway of the
gate, are still
hanging the
chains used for
executions in
the long ago.
By all accounts
they were very
frequently used,
too. Besides
getting the em-
brace of the
noose around
his neck, the
condemned per-
son had a great
iron weight fas-
tened to each
leg so that no
mistake should
be made about
his business.
The weights are
still there. Just
inside the arch-
way. and on a
level with the
place where the
victim was choked, is
a cell with iron bars,
where other criminals
could have a view of
the proceedings. But
these reserved stalls
were extremely un-
popular, for their occu-
pancy generally meant
that it was a full-dress
rehearsal of another
performance wherein
the present spectators
would take a star part.

“Chloe”: Didn’t some Bulletin writers
once suggest that Australia should make a
Literary Shrine of Gordon’s Dingley Dell?
Well, this is what the shrine looks like' at pre-
sent. The poor four rooms, very square, com-
mon-place and suburban, have squalid walls,
dirty as possible, with shreds and patches
of highly-colored cheap wallpapers dangling
in fly-spotted tags. Other mural decorations
have been provided by the visiting tourist,
some in indelible blue pencil, some in char-
coal —classic legends, most of them, telling
of how Bill Muggins and his Eliza spent their
honeymoon in the neighborhood in 1902, and
honored the Dell with a visit. A list of some
hundred visitors is tabled in fine out-stand-
ing scrawls, together with criticisms of the
dead poet's works, his life, his death and
chances of salvation. To reach the shrine
the visitor crosses a grass patch, rich in a
species of travelling burr, which, affixing
itself hundreds strong about the ankles
gradually works its way out by the coat-
collar or finds a comfortable resting-place
in the back hair. The granite obelisk to
the poet s memory has a fine position on the
slope facing the Blue Lake—blue and
sparkling like a sapphire—but the base of
the monument, and even the pillar itself, is
defaced with the scrawls of Goths. Nearby is
another monument, to the soldiers fallen in
the South African campaign ; this is defaced
in the same way, and mad memento-hunters
have gone so far as to pick out the leaded
lettering of the names. If Australians have
nothing to learn in valor, initiative and
dash they would not be the worse if their
instinctive vandalism were curbed. Curi-
ously, the untaught Malay takes up a knife
or a crayon in his spare moments and pro-
duces something of beauty. But we? Some-
thing is wrong with our system of education
surely. Mt. Gambier has attractions for the
tourist, and features of native beauty which
set it apart from any other spot in Aus-
tralia. But if the traveller wishes to carry
away a good impression he will avoid its
shrines and monuments.

Sam McCauley, N.S.W. Controller of
Prisons, got a jolt when he inspected the
venerable and stinking Hobart (Tas.) Gaol
the other day. He remarked that he didn’t
think that a sentence of imprisonment
should carry with it quite so many bugs as
swarm in the old wooden cells, and he
seemed to have the idea that to lock men
up in cells 10 by 6 by 5 feet didn't give them
a fair fighting chance against the enemy.
The ramshackle nature of the old place led
him further to observe that every time they
let a prisoner out they ought really to thank
him for having been good enough to stay in
—or words to that effect.

AFTER THE WEDDING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We’re all alone. And is it true
We’re married now; and is it you ?
We’ll take the track, and tramp
Over the hill—you hold my arm—
And cross the creek, and skirt the farm;
The moon will be our lamp.
I’m glad- we’re safe away. The boys
(They meant it well) made such a noise
My head’s still buzzing round.
That was a spree. You liked it fine?
And Johnny’s speech—he’d too much wine....
Take care, it’s rocky ground.
They’ll still be dancing. Won’t they shout
And laugh, and swing the girls about,
And won’t the glasses foam !
How cool the wind feels on your cheek....
There’s just one word I want to speak—
Listen ! We’re going home !
I knew that on our wedding night
We’d have a moon. It’s not too bright;
Some clouds are in the sky.
Kiss me! We’re in the myrtle shade.
My own, my wife! Are you afraid?
You’re frightened.... So am I.
Here is the creek. Step on that stump—
Don’t hold too tight... .Now, steady!....
Jump !....
Suppose we rest a while!
Tell me, and do you love me yet,
And is there nothing you regret?....
It’s just another mile.
“When other lips” —how does it go?—
“ Their tales of love do tell”— that’s so—
“ Then you’ll remember me.
Then you’ll remember” —queer old thing!
That scared the m0p0ke....1 can’t sing....
Look, that's a funny tree!
You see that house? We’re going there.
I’ll drag you in, and I don’t care
Whatever you may say.
For you’re my sweetheart, you’re my wife,
You’re mine, I'll own you all my life,
You’ll never get away!
Where is your hand ? I want a kiss.
It's wonderful it’s all like this ;
There's no more I desire.
We'll have a supper by ourselves,
And see our own things on the shelves,
And sit beside the fire.
We're at the gate. There’s no one near.
You won’t be sorry that we’re here?
We’ll think of all we’ve seen ;
There never was a lovelier site,
On such a cottage glimmering white,
The best that’s ever been.
It’s all for us—the gumtrees tall,
The creek, and little birds, and all
The stars, and autumn moon.
We'll take it all, the smooth and rough—
I know I’m not half good enough....
And life is finished soon.
We both live here —it’s strange, it’s true!
It’s our place, all for me and you!
We won’t complain of life...'.
Here is the door....but where’s the key?
I’ve got it... .and it’s you and me. ...
Come in, my sweetheart, wife!
VICTORIA.

The speculation flying around the vacant
chair of Chief Justice in Adelaide was
settled, as The Bulletin expected, by the
appointment of Judge Murray. Way had
held it for over 40 years ; in fact, the State
has had only three “Chiefs”—Cooper, Han-
son and Way. Old precedents were under-
stood to say that a lawyer who had once
gained the serene elevation of the Bench
must be satisfied, and not scheme, or plan
for further advancement. This means that,
when a Chief Justice retires or dies, some-
one from outside must be lifted over the
heads of all his colleagues—which is not
common-sense, and has been rightly trodden
on in Queensland, Westralia and Tasmania.
Now S. Australia has trodden on it, too, and
the results are likely to be most happy. In
the present case Josiah Symon stands out at
the head of the profession, and it is understood
that he has refused Junior Judgeships with
an eye to being ready for the bigger thing.
But Way lasted till Symon was too
old. If Bench seniority had been re-
garded, Judge Gordon would have be-
come Chief; but his health is not
good. Thus the way was opened for
Judge Murray, and his appointment pleases
nearly everybody. When Way died J. 11.
Vaughan, Attorney-General, was watched
with interest. lie is a man with a big future
as politician and lawyer, though without the
experience for a high post. But anxiety
was soon relieved by his statement that aii
old precedent would not affect him, and that
whatever office-grabbing may have been done
in the Bad Old Times would not be repeated
under a Labor Government.

“Hori”: “Murkah’s” wireless notes (B.
(i/l/’IG) recall a trip across the Tasman
four years ago. On the first night out the
spark was busy till very late. We were in
touch with the station at Wellington
(M.L.), with the Ulimaroa coming east,
with the Mooltan in the Bight, with
a Java steamer on the. Queensland
coast, and with H.M.S. Drake just
clear of Hobart and heading for Sydney.
Yet w r e couldn’t raise Pennant Hills"; and
a lady on board whose husband was ill at
Sydney wanted badly to have a word with
someone there. Presently the Java steamer
away up near Rockhampton offered assist-
ance, and soon we could hear the bee-like
drone of her call. Then the whole circle of
ships became interested. The Mooltan sug-
gested a new way of waking ’em up, and
the Drake’s big voice started roaring curses
across the foam at Pennant Hills. Suddenly
the Ulimaroa chipped in with the glad news
that she had got the Hills. - “Send your
urgent through me, old man,” she buzzed to
us. Our spark began to sizzle again, and so
the message got through, and the excitement
among the ships and stations, hundreds of
miles from each other, died away, though the
Drake kept going for a long time, talking to
a ship on the Indian station whose replies
we could not hear.
QUITE SOMEBODY ELSE.
BUNG (to chronic beer-sparrer): “ He's not
here.”
SPARRER: “Who?”
BUNG: " The man you're looking for.”
SPARRER: “I'm not looking for him.”
“Yarra Ben”: The enemy trader with
poor knowledge of English is often an un-
conscious humorist. A Teuton in business
in Melbourne, having missed the opportunity
seized by so many of his compatriots of
changing his name when the Imperial Boss
started his murders, still hangs out at his
old address, with the same unfortunate cog-
nomen on his shop-front. That is to say,
the same with a slight addition. The original
blazing German indiscretion still remains
on the signboard, but its proprietor, with
a touch of the genius of the “Belle of New
York’s” Polite Lunatic, has had painted the
words ‘The late’ in front of it. So now ti j
sign reads :
The Late Herr Schmell.
Business as Usual.
DON'T INTERRUPT.
THE YOUNG LADY : “I consulted the chemist, and he advised me”
THE DOCTOR: “My dear young Miss, chemists always give foolish advice!”
THE YOUNG LADY: “ to come to you!”
“Silas” : I see by my
Bulletin that a man
was shot by a rabbit at
Perthville (N.S.W.) the
other day. Shot by a
rabbit! It’s a paltry
finish for a good man at
a time like this; but
there have been ends
even more ignominious.
I know of one 14-stone
man whose mortal coil
was clipped off by a
mouse. Ilis name was
Hardy; he kept the
store at Poll’s Point,
north-eastern Vic. Ilis
shop was not big enough
for the stock, and he
had swung a bunch of
shovels to the ceiling
with a cord. A nesting
mouse nibbled the cord,
and Hardy happened to
be passing underneath
when the shovels fell.
R.I.P. There’s the case,
too, of the braceman at
a small Tasmanian
mine. He had put a
plug of dynamite near
the fire to soften, and
then lay down and
dozed. A clawing chicken
kicked the dynamite
into the fire. In nine
cases out of ten dyna-
mite thrown in a fire
will just burn ; this was
the tenth case. The
only comfort the brace-
man’s widow had was
in the knowledge that
the careless chicken did
not survive the shock.

A erdad”: The best example I have seen
on town-planning in one of its aspects is
Santiago de Chile, South America. It ex-
cels in its system of street numbering and
naming, which has the advantages of the
Yankee plan without its disadvantages. The
trouble with calling streets by numbers, as
the Y'ankees do, is that numbers are so
easily confused. Anyone who has lived in
Yankee towns knows this. Names are much
more easily remembered. Santiago is laid
out on a plain with a gentle gradient, and
all the streets are named, as in any Austra-
lian town, and not called by numbers. Every
block has 100 numbers allotted to it. The
streets run north and south from a central
avenue—La Alameda (which means the
avenue of alamos or poplars). This is on a
slight slant compared with the rest of the
streets —like Broadway (N.Y.). Other
streets run west from the Cerro de Santa
Lucia, a rocky eminence in the plain. If
any street starts from some other point the
houses in it are numbered to correspond with
other parallel streets: for example, if one
street starts six blocks from where the other
parallel streets start, its numbers begin at
800. Even if there is only one house in a
block it will be given a number correspond-
ing to its position. Thus number 1452 in
any street will be in the corresponding posi-
tion to 1452 in all parallel streets. The sys-
tem is very convenient. Any house or street
can be described to a stranger who does not
know the names of the streets, by saying it
is in, say, blocks 1400 and 800. Follow up
the street you are in till 1400 is reached,
and then go at right angles till you come to
800. Another point: What is the good of
using the words street, road, etc.? In South
America the streets are called simply by
their name, omitting such words as “street.”
as one might say' “214 George, Sydney,” for
the home address of The Bulletin.

Perhaps they did it innocently or perhaps
it is another error of the infernal printer,
but the damning revelation is thus boldly
set forth. There are 160 Europeans in the
Chatham Islands, so the official year book
states, and it adds that there are “249
Maori women living with European hus-
bands !”
Private Enterprise in the baking trade has
got the consumer by the wool in Hobart and
is mixing the dough of trouble for itself.
A couple of months ago the Government re-
duced the price of its imported wheat to 4s.
7d. per bushel, a loss to the State of about
3s. 6d., on condition that the millers sold
flour at £ll per ton, and that the bakers
sold bread at 3|d. per 21b. loaf after Jan-
uary 1. The millers are carrying out their
part of the contract, but the bakers are still
raking in 4d. per loaf, and say plain and
plump that they are not going to reduce the
price, because they think flour may go up
later. And the Government does not seem
able to do anything except tell the bakers
how much they ought to be ashamed of them-
selves, which hurts the bakers not at all.
John Madden’s eloquent tongue, lately
held in restraint, got off the chain at Frank-
ston (Vic.) last week and broke into re-
cruiting speech. Having recovered from his
prediction that the war was going to end
last August, Madden is now convinced that
the Germans want a lot of military and
commercial beating:—
Nobody loves the Germans—and Australians least
of all. The world will henceforth know Germany
for what she is. Everyone derides, despises and
detests her. After this war is over a German will
pass by as the leper in Judaea, avoided by everyone,
ami greeted by the cry of “Unclean” wherever he
goes. We will take pains to see that the Germans
no longer hold our lands, or do things they did
before hostilities began. She will never engage in
our trade. We shall rid ourselves of her
When Madden arrived at this point in his
impassioned harangue a voice asked : “Why
not start now?” Whereupon the orator
shifted his ground and called upon the meet-
ing to recruit. The interjection was a par-
ticularly nasty one for John Madden. In
his capacity of Chief Justice he did his
best to dis-intern all the lepers in the local
camp. The test case of Wallach v. the
Minister of War was heard by Madden,
C.J., and he gave judgment in favor of the
interned German, thereby necessitating the
re-arrest of Wallach and the quashing of
his Honor’s judgment by the Federal High
Court. So the policy of ridding ourselves
of Germans was the last thing in the world
that Madden should have talked about. The
commercial world of Melbourne was at least
quit of Wallach and hundreds of others for
the term of the war’s unnatural life, but
John Madden saw, or thought lie saw, sound
legal cause for restoring Wallach to liberty.
Moreover, the alien gentleman’s brief respite
from internment was the occasion for a joy-
ful gathering of Wallach’s friends, and some
of Madden’s family connections were among
them. They didn’t seems anxious to rid
the country of Germans.

According to S. M. Herald, when Prime
Minister .Hughes was leaving for Europe,
his last act as the train drew out was to
call for three cheers for Sydney. The
Telegraph says the cheers were for Aus-
tralia, which sounds more like Hughes. But
how typical of the Herald to keep Sydney
so close to its eyes that it can’t get a glimpse
of Australia even in the background !
For cheerfully making the best of a bad
job the world simply can’t match them. This
one was a youngster from the Western Dis-
trict of Victoria, brought in with a badly
shattered leg. There had been a generous
effort to save it, but the limb had to go, and
the Anzacker came back to full conscious-
ness to find it all over. The nurse looked for
bitter lamentations. Instead, the lad made
just one brief comment. “Ah, well,” he said,
“only one leg to be pulled now.”
DEAD SEA FRLIT.

JULIETE: “ What’s the good, love? We would

This shows how Australian artists in
London are doing their bit. An attempt was
made recently to fix up a dinner to a batch
of wounded Anzacs, the festivity to take
place in Chelsea Club, practically an all-Aus-
tralian institution. When the moment
arrived not one artist was available to act
as host, all being on the national job! At
last one black-and-white man was got hold
of, and he was only obtainable because it is
officially recognised that he can do his best
for the nation, as a recruiting agent, by keep-
ing to his ordinary daily work.

ITEMS
Judging by information received, the
Kaiser has got it in the neck.
Died at Bankstown (N.S.W.), James B.
Shaw, who served in the U.S. army through-
out the civil war of 1860-61, in the days
before Americans had become too proud to
fight. Born in Scotland 82 years ago, Shaw
had become a naturalised U.S. citizen early
in life, and retained his citizenship to the
last, though for 30 years lie had lived
under the Australian flag. Up to a little
while ago he was a well-known figure as a
judge at Highland gatherings in Sydney.
Wray Palliser, secretary to Maoriland’s
’lgh Commissioner, who collected a C.M.G.
in the scramble for New Year gauds, was
once in the M.L. Audit Department at Wel-
lington. As a youngster he was prominent
in athletic matters, being one of the pioneers
of Rugby in Loan Land. But it is over 30
years ago since he was sent to London as
audit-officer to the Agent-General and later
succeeded Walter Ivenneway as secretary.
ANOTHER INJUSTICE TO MOTHER.
HE : “I see they've given another Victoria
Cross to one of our boys.”
SHE : “Hi don’t believe in all them Victorian
Crosses, I don’t. Why can’t they give
a few New South Wales crosses, I’d like
to know.”
“Ribbons”: Don’t you fellows say any-
thing more about - Gussie from the haber-
dashery department. Get a move on like
Dave McConaghy, who, when war broke out,
was working in a Sydney mercer’s shop.
He left with the 3rd Battalion as lieutenant
and is at present in command with the rank
of acting-colonel. He was through the land-
ing at Anzac and the equally terrible Lone.
Pine assault, and has so far achieved two
wounds, a severe illness and a C.M.G. And
don’t forget, either, that Jacka hopped over
the ribbon counter at Ballarat to win Aus-
tralia’s first Y.C. in the present unpleasant-
ness.
MIS UNDERSTOOD.
FEATHER FIEND : “You know you should
have been at the Front long ago.”
THE ARTISTIC ONE: "Yes, I know; but the
bally editors don’t seem to recognise my
genius !”
George W. Smith, the Speck’s Commis-
sioner for Railways, is resolved apparently
to make himself distinguished from the other
smiths. Being charged at the Hobart police
court recently with failing to fill in his
income-tax return, counsel for the Crown
said of him that he had already been fined
a trifle for the same offence, and a heavy
clout was desired this time. The Bench
said it was really surprised, and chipped £5
out of his salary of £l2OO.
If Billjim decides to go on strike for more
hours in the trenches, an increase in the
charges against the enemy and other privi-
leges, anti-unionists will be able to allege
that the trouble is caused by the paid agi-
tators who have gone to the Front. The
latest Union secretary to relinquish his job
for the khaki is Robert Dickie, of the Work-
ing Jewellers’ Union. He leaves one of his
main agitations still unsuccessful. That
was for a gold-stamping Act, to compel the
marking of all Australian-made jewellery
with a plain and truthful legend of its
quality. The Commonwealth enforces
honesty in the stamping of imported articles,
but, owing to the existence and indifference
of the States, anything or nothing may be
stamped on jewellery made within the Com-
monwealth.
“Pair o’ Sixes”: Mention of W. W.
(“Baldy”) Davis (B. 23/12/T5) recalls
that he was the first man in N. S. Wales
to demonstrate the success of artesian bor-
ing. When owner of Iverribee station he
pushed a hole down 1070-odd feet, which
yielded a daily flow of 350,000 gallons. Since
then 531 bores have been sunk, with a total
yield of over 1,000,000,000 gallons per day,
and a total benefit to the drought-cursed
North-West beyond the realms of mere
arithmetic.
A sequel to the Von Hagen uproar of a
few months ago turned the snort of scorn
upon those furious patriots who would have
had him interned on the strength of his
name, despite his Australianism and the fact
that his ancestry was fiercely anti-Prussian
years before the Potsdam beast had ceased to
fawn upon England. Von Hagen was up-
country with a team when Wade and others
were worrying over his being at large to
spread Labor principles ; and later, when in
the depth of harvest the “Wallaby” route-
marchers couldn’t get transport, he offered
to carry their swags gratis from Yass to
Sydney. On the way the flower of Liberal-
ism met the volunteers and harangued them
as noble patriots ; and old Von sat smiling
on his .waggon while the very men who
wanted to put him behind barbed wire
assured him he was a hero and other fine
things.
“Lex” on some unwritten history:—
The death of Way, S.A.'s Chief Justice, recalls
that had he succeeded in his endeavors to influence
very powerful friends in England there would have
been no High Court. Little Way strongly favored
the retention of direct appeal from State Courts to
the Privy Council, and he made strenuous efforts to
obtain the rescission of Chapter/ 111. of the Constitu-
tion Act. Kingston got wind of this, and, with
Symon’s" help, squelched the “little Chief's” under-
ground work. Had Way succeeded he might, of
course, have been appointed to a high judicial posi-
tion on the British Court of Appeal, which would
almost for certain have been the alternative; but
his engineering meant good-bye to his chance of
being the first C.J. of the High Court. Kingston was
a good friend, but a bitter enemy, and he never
forgave Way for this.
It was cabled superfluously last week that
Reid attended the House of Commons and
made an immediate impression. It was only
necessary to say that George took his seat.
Someone has been totting up the ages of
the members of the N. S. Wales Leg. Coun-
cil. There are 54 members, and six are over
80 —Dangar, Ivetliel, Fosbery, Moses,
McCaughey and Meagher. Eight others have
passed 70 —Gormley, Holborrow, Creed,
Kater. .Tago Smith. Robson, and
Triekett. Henry Carey Dangar, the father
both of the House and of the Bar, is 80.
Wound-up, after a long
life of public service,
Charles Christie Graham,
for long official assignee in
Dunedin (M.L.). Graham
opened his account and
accent in Fifeshire, and in
1855 discovered Australia,
where with his brothers he
engaged in big mercantile
business. Eleven years
later he went to Maoriland
and started growing sheep
in the Waitaki district of
the South Island. He repre-
sented Oamaru in the House
of Reps, for three years,
beginning in 1869, and then
removed to the North, where
he entered the Wellington
Provincial Council. He
busied himself with the Wel-
lington Education Board
and the College Board of
Governors until 1878, when
he tried his hand at being
town clerk of Wellington.
Five years sickened him of
this and he became official
assignee. Ten years after-
wards he went to look after
the bankrupts in Dunedin,
but he had chucked that and
was a magistrate when he
got in the way of the
Mower.
Victoria’s lately-retired Parliamentary
draughtsman, Edward Carlile, who came
from the Cold Country to Australia as a lad,
and, by having the right kind of brains,
luck and friends, subsequently became a
K.C., has two Australian sons, both of them
wearing the Australian uniform. Hildred
is an A.A.M.C. captain, and at the time of
the evacuation had spent six months at
Anzac. Keith ivent with the original expe-
dition to Papua and is still there.
Adelaide’s Judges are a comparatively
youthful lot, and all natives of S.A. Chief
Justice George Murray is of the famous
souatting and stock-breeding family. He
had a brilliant career at St. Peter’s school
and at Cambridge. He is only 52, tall and
handsome, with charming manners, a pri-
vate income—and no wife. Buchanan is
67, and a lawyer of the practical type. He
was an auctioneer before going into the law,
and his business-like qualities made him
Master of the Supreme Court long before
he went on the Bench. Jethro Brown is
only 47. He did brilliantly at Cambridge,
and has been a professor in turn at Hobart
(1893 to 1900), London, Wales and
Adelaide. He has to his credit some very
solid books on the Principles of Legislation
and the theory of Democracy. He took a
turn as president of the Commonwealth
Sugar Commission when Judge Gordon
resigned.

was getting busy, he rushed across to Eng-
land and joined the Naval Volunteers. On the
strength of having
seen actual fight-
ing in Mexico he
was given a com-
mission and sent
to save Antwerp.
Though he didn’t
do it he was made
a captain, and was
sent out to Galli-
poli. It wasn’t long
before he became
a temporary major
while acting with
the land forces.
Later he was made
a lit'utenant-com-
mander and then
commander, which
is rapid moving for
a youngster who
practically started

months ago.

The Chief Justiceship of S. Australia was
first offered to the senior Judge, J. 11. Gor-
don, who declined it, being in poor health and
having in view, the obligation to act as
Lieut.-Governor if he accepted it. Way’s
terms as Lieut.-Governor, if added together,
make a far bigger period than that served
by any actual Governor in the State! The
vacancy Murray leaves is filled by Alexan-
der Buchanan, who has been a fourth
Judge, on a temporary appointment renewed
from time to time since 1912. Buchanan
was also president of the Industrial Court
of the State, but the modest Vaughan did
not aspire even to that post. It goes to
Jethro Brown, Professor of Law at Adelaide
University.

The Emden is now said to be a
shapeless, contorted mass of rusty ironmon-
gery balancing itself on a reef; so the pro-
ject of salving the pirate’s remains has been
abandoned. The guns and similar things
have been removed, and though some are on
exhibition in England, most of them will
be scattered round among the big towns of
Australia as trophies of the “blooding” of
our own navy.
“Moana” : The German piano is going to
be one of the problems of the future in
these parts. It’s all very well to say that
people here won’t buy it when the war
ceases and it comes on the market again.
But —well, consider the position. Before
the war a good piano could be purchased
wholesale from the maker in Germany for
£l5. When the manufacturer climbs out of
his cellar and starts to make up for lost
time he will take advantage of the low wrnges
and general misery to offer pianos at less
than that. There will be no marks on them
to indicate where they were made. Say this
continent gets really angry and smites Ger-
hog stuff with a 100 per cent, duty, which
nine men out of ten would consider un-
reasonably savage and vindictive, would that
keep the tainted piano out? The original
cost would be, say, £l2. the duty would be
£l2, and the packing and freight might be
about another £5; so the accursed thing
could bump on the wharf here with a joyous
“Hoeh !” at £29. Sell it at £5O and it outs
the local article and the British ditto and
returns the uninquiring importer a cool <a
per cent, profit. Out of that he will be able to
spare half a crown per piano in decorating
the instrument with a name-plate imported
from Wilson’s country that will make the
patriotic purchaser easy in mind because n
will say: “Made by White and Black in
England.” The only way to make sure that
a German article doesn’t sneak in is to bol
the door.
IMPERIAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The mighty Emperor looked down
Upon this little world,
And said: “My splendid reign to crown
With majesty of great renown -
These people shall be hurled
Into a war by me invented
Of magnitude unprecedented.”
He set the fires of strife alight.
He stood above the din
And froth and fury of the fight,
A figure vulgar souls to fright,
A vivid, living sin,
And “Greatest I of all,” said he,
“In glorious iniquity!”
He threw a deadlier lightning blast;
And with his storms of hail,
Of Hell’s infernal metals cast,
lie crushed the cities of the past
To dust along the dale.
His reapers count the harvest’s yield,
A million bleeding on the field.
See from his height steps down the King!
His arrogance is fled,
He creeps within his servile ring,
A sickly, shaken, whimpering thing,
And seeks the royal bed.
Neglected now his fearful moil—
His Majesty has got a boil!

Applications for the War Loan close on
February 1. Australia has to raise a very
large sum of money; and the question is
How is it going to be done? There are three
ways: (1) To loaf on J. Bull, who has
hinted to Australia that he has a pretty
tough job to keep himself going; (2) to
raise the money by loan; (3) to raise the
money by taxation. It is just as well that
these alternatives should thoroughly soak in.
Loans mean interest and repayment of prin-
cipal. Taxation means —good-bye to both !
The Commonwealth Government has not
issued any threats ; but —which is it going
to be? _

The Q.N. probably never pretends to give
its exact profits. As a matter of fact, no
bank ever knows in any one term what its
exact profits are. To-day you buy a farm
at £8 an acre. The outlook is pretty good.
But in a few weeks a drought sets in. Next
harvest you reap nothing, and farming hav-
ing fallen into disfavor, your farm, you find,
isn’t worth more than £7. But precisely
when you lost the pound you don’t know, and
neither does a bank know just when it drops
its money. The position is complicated by
the fact that often —in resilient Australia
particularly—what looks like a loss suddenly
decides to turn itself into a profit; and you
don’t know precisely when you make the
profit either. This bank made tremendous
losses 20-odd years ago, and wrote some of
them off out of capital, and some (it sounds
disgraceful now to say it) out of customers’
deposits. From these latter ss. in the £
was struck off; the other 15s. was repre-
sented by interminable stock. The ss. written
off was to be made good out of future pro-
fits, and no dividend was to be paid until
this capital had been restored (without in-
terest) to depositors—which was the least
the hank could do in the circumstances.
Probably because no matter how much profit
the bank showed it could not pay a dividend,
the management has never been much con-
cerned about showing big figures. It seems
to have reckoned its duty fully done if it
showed the general tendency of the business.
Meanwhile it no doubt made the inside posi-
tion as safe as possible; and a general man-
ager would be a fool if he didn’t do it in a
State which offers such violent contrasts of
fortune as Queensland.
Also the ss. has been steadily reduced,
though there is very little doubt that repay-
ment has never been bustled, the strength-
ening of the inside position being always put
first. The following table shows approxi-
mately what has been done: —

£630,943 12/-in £= £618,454 £63,389
So 12s. in the £ has been paid and there is
enough in hand to pay another Is. 3d. = 13s.
3d. Of that lot ss. 6d. has been paid in
three years, including a special Is.; and it
was said a while ago that another “special”
was in sight. Perhaps it isn’t fair to argue
from the past concerning the future; but
anyhow the war has lasted 18 months, and
during that period a steady 9d. a half-year
has been paid off, in spite of the Queensland
drought. Nobody can say what is going to
happen during the next few years; but it is
hard to believe that the Q.N. will be in any
worse position than it has been during the
past 18 months. After the debt to the old
depositors has been paid off shareholders will
be called up to the feast. Capital is now
only £480,000, and the disclosed profit on
that is and has been for some years over 20
p.c. p.a. However, the management won’t
do any such foolish thing as declare racketty
dividends like that. It will accomplish the
same purpose and at the same time
strengthen the bank by calling in more cap-
ital and paying probably 10 p.c. on the lot.
As usual the cash position is very strong.
Disregarding the interminable stock, which
is just as firmly nailed down to the pre-
mises as the share capital, the debts to the
public are £7,273,937, and the liquid assets
(including public securities written down)
total £4,201,478. Thus over 57 p.c. of the
money for which the public can call is wait-
ing for them. There is between six and
spven times more interminable stock, carry-
ing a fixed p.c., than there is share cap-
ital; and this disproportion makes it good
for the shareholders in times of dear money,
because they get all it earns over 3§ p.c. net.
But, in return, capital has to guarantee the
stock both interest and principal; though
that of course means less and less risk with
the growth of reserves, internal and visible.

In addition to the £580,252 mentioned in
that last line there is an Investments Depre-
ciation Reserve, £33,743. For many years
there were two savings banks in N. S. Wales
•—this one and what was generally known
as the Barrack-street bank, the latter semi-
private in name, yet for all practical pur-
poses a State concern. There never was any
doubt about what stand the Government
would have to take, supposing Barrack-
street got into trouble, after Premier George
Dibbs drove back a crowd of nervous .deposi-
tors 25 years ago with a notice declaring
that the State was behind the bank. From
that moment “Barrack-street” had no justi-
fication for a separate existence; yet vested
interests stood in the way and the amalgam-
ation was not brought about until about
18 months ago. The whole of the depositors
are now protected, not by a tacit or implied
undertaking of the State Government, but
by an actual guarantee.
As for the State, it gets its protection
from the substantial reserves shown above.
Certainly reserves of £620,000 on assets
totalling over £34,000,000 don’t on the sur-
face look overwhelming ; but one has to know
the investments before one can judge the
risks: —•

Loans to Governments and municipalities,
which mostly mean loans on the taxpaying
capacity of the people, represent 69 p.c. Add
liquid assets, and you get 77 p.c. of the
assets calling for little in the way of re-
serves. Of the other 23 p.c. 13 p.c. is in
loans to the Advances Department; and the
Advances Department has its own reserve
fund, amounting to £71,741, which further
improves the Savings Bank Department’s
security. Still the depositors, as depositors,
needn’t bother about all these extra safety
appliances. For them it is enough that the
State _ guarantees the deposits. That is to
say, in the last resort the whole taxable
wealth of the country is at the disposal of
the depositor.
Last year’s interest was 34 p.c. up to £2OO
and 3 p.c. for the next £300; but it has been
found necessary of late to put all up on to
the 3f p.c. mark. Current year’s profits are
not therefore going to be anything like last
year’s. In fact, gross profits last year were
only £3 13s. 7d. p.c., and though that can
no doubt be put up a trifle by higher interest
charges on a little of the invested capital,
and by reducing the proportion of idle
money, it is doubtful whether the Commis-
sioners will this year be able to show any
profit worth mentioning.

This bank operates mostly in Queensland
and in the Northern part of N. S. Wales,
and neither area has been having a good
time. Add to that the dislocation of the
foreign exchange business, additional taxes,
and the cost of temporary assistance to
replace the 27. p.c. of the staff who are said
to be in khaki, and the shrinkage in profits
is fully explained. Certainly, charges for
accommodation have, on the whole, been
raised; the gross profit for the half-year
was about £lOOO greater than for the corres-
ponding part of 1914. But. like most others,
the Bank of North Queensland, while itself
paying more for money apparently hasn t
found many customers rushing it with unim-
peachable securities. Hence the holding, ot
liquid assets is unusually large, amounting
to no less than 47 p.c. of total liabilities.
This comparison shows these and other lines
in the accounts :
Dec., 1905. June, 1915. Dec., 1915.
Deposits .. £364,334 £1,134,157 £1,152,294
Bills, etc. .. 47,376 41,797 75,589
Liquid assets .. 164,154 493,192 £75,750
Advances .. 342,567 815,190
Premises . . 27,400 /5,000 85,000
There is thus £1,227,888 owing to the pub-
lic, and £575,755 liquid in the safe; and
against the £(152,128 not represented uy
liquid assets there are £800,908 of other
assets. Presumably therefore nobody is
worrying—unless it be the management,
which is probably waiting on the doormat
for a few substantial-looking-customers to
come along with a guarantee that the war
will be over and everything fixed up the
right way this year, and borrow a bit more
on the strength of it.

The State runs this in competition with the
Commonwealth Savings Bank. Efforts were
made to amalgamate the two, and do away
with a lot of unnecessary clerks and agents
and rent and doormats and signboards; but
the State Government wouldn’t agree to give
up a Cohen who is so handy to appeal to
when the Treasurer wants a bit to go on
with. The first line in the next comparison
shows the milk in the cocoanut: —
1905. 1915.
Government loans.. .. £1,852,362 £13,631,139

Foreclosed properties .. 161,718 6,611
Other assets .. .. 222,062 1,042,039
Thus in 10 years the Government has bor-
rowed nearly 12 millions through this Sav-
ings Bank, and the municipalities and Board
of Works over a million; and as that repre-
sents about three-fourths of the net increase
in deposits during that period, the Govern-
ment no doubt very rightly decided that it
couldn’t expect to do so well if a change
were made. Apparently the public is very
well satisfied, too; anyway, it has come
along freely enough with money. The follow-
ing shows the growth of deposits :
1904 .. £10,582,808 1910 .. £15,417,888
1905 .. 10,896,741 1911 .. 17,274.424

1909 .. 14,101,710 1915 .. 25,044,029
Practically all the new money which hasn’t
been mopped up by the Government and the

in fixed deposits or been lent by the Advances
Bepartment. The latter borrows mostly
from the Savings Department of the bank,
on debentures, to lend out to farmers and
house- and shop-builders. The Savings
Department does a little in the way of
mortgages itself, hut not very much. 'Con-
sidering the nature of the securities the
reserves are satisfactory, and it would take
a large-sized disaster to wipe them out. In
that case of course the State would have to
make things all right for the depositors,

A quarter of a century ago the moving-
picture of the moment was the cyclorama-
and it didn’t really move. It seems amazing
now that anybody should have expected that
it could go on making money; yet a good
many people evidently did expect it, and a
co. in Sydney not only built special pre-
mises but bought the freehold. For years
and years this co. paid nothing but its way
Then some people grabbed the ice-skating
craze and used it as a hook on which to
hang the prospectus of a co. to acquire a
lease of the derelict, with right of purchase.
The new co.’s luck was right in. True, the
Glaciarium craze didn’t amount to much;
but the picture business boomed, and the
building thus found tenants in summer,
when there was no ice-skating. Also the
premises soon found that if they had tried
they couldn’t have put themselves in a
much better position to catch cold-storage
trade. It was soon clear that it was this
prosaic end of the business that had to be
pushed; therefore further land wms bought
in Ilarris-street, and thereon stores have
been built. Evidently the outlook has con-
tinued good, as indeed it must for this cold-
storage business, and a storey additional
to those originally planned is being built,
increasing the total new building cost to about
£17,500. But so profitable has been the co.,
and so wide the margin of earnings be-
yond dividends, that, in spite of the con-
struction programme, the liabilities (includ-
ing mortgage) in excess of liquid assets on
October 3l wore just under £lO,OOO. In-
cluding the £lO,OOO of water just added to
the ice. the total capital is now £65,000;
and against that there is no goodwill, etc.
—it is all represented by things that you
can see or smell or bump yourself against
in the dark.

Hughes left Mahon, as the latter states,
a “difficult problem” to solve in arranging
for the removal from the registers of Aus-
tralian companies of the names of all alien
and naturalised enemy shareholders. It
is not. so much the difficulty as the utility
or futility of it that calls for consideration.
It may be accepted as a certainty that there
is not. a share register of any big banking,
financial, industrial or mining co. which
does, not contain a number of names of
foreigners. . What purpose is to be served
by removing these names? And what about
companies which have registers in Australia
and London? The Commonwealth ukase
could, not apply in London, and were it
practicable to enforce it here there would
be the curious anomaly 7 that Von Schmidt
would not be allowed to draw dividends or
make profits on shares to spend in Aus-
tralia, while his namesake abroad could draw
Australian-earned money to spend out of
Australia. Hughes is- a splendid man to
listen to. But the Lord help the man who
has to try to put his theories into practice.

ck In tile past the bank was well
Greeted and blessed with good managers in
t J. Jones and Chas. Eyres, to whom the
iii'pspnt strong position of the bank is largely
Tie Of late years, however, there lias been
an absolute lack of enterprise in the direc-
t rs > policy, to such an extent that many—
perhaps a great majority—of the share-
holders would prefer to realise the assets and
„ge the funds themselves.
The position at Broken Hill is bad, and
not likely to soon improve. Local opinion
.rives the' strike a probable three-months’ run,
and before that time is out the wild-cat mis-
leaders of the miners will attempt something
sensational, since the Government is likely
to let matters drift. Before he left Australia
Prime Minister Hughes appealed to the
miners to submit their troubles to the Arbi-
tration Court, promising an immediate hear-
ing or, in default of that, an award dating
hack to the return to work. But as the
miners are striking against arbitration, they
simply declined to listen. The most amaz-
ing feature of the case so far is that, though
the miners are striking against arbitration,
and though the engine-drivers, carpenters
and Port Pirie smelter-men are all opposed
to the miners’ attitude, a number of city
unions which have approved of arbitration
are supporting the Broken Hill Ishmaels
with money. Had the Government any
backbone, or even any decency, this flagrant
defiance of the law would, of course, be
at once dealt with. It is time this Broken
Hill union was put in its right class. It
is an anarchist body, pure and simple, and
if its leaders were in German pay they
couldn’t do worse for the country they live
in - ,
“0.K.” on a subject that the interested
party and the disinterested critic are always
disputing about
j. Dixon, the aerated water manufacturer who
turned his business into 0.T., Ltd., is always
ready to discuss the interesting question of trade-
marks regarded as assets. One new point that he
makes is worth attention. The old firm of P. G.
Dixon & Co. (which 0.T., Ltd., bought out) had
made a specialty of “Macedon” sodawater, i.e.,
Macedon mountain water be-gassed. This went out
of the market, and the manufacture was discon-
tinued. But the memory of the “Macedon” brand
survived, and when J. Dixon subsequently put it
into circulation again the old demand for it was
restored with increased vigor. The neglected trade-
mark, says Dixon, had preserved its value —-the
advt. money spent on it by P. G. Dixon of old
had made it a real asset. As a crowning triumph
of his theory that bygone advertising has a value
of its own, Dixon asks whether the name of Pears’
Soap would not remain an asset if Pears’s factories
were destroyed, the stock of soap exhausted, the
firm’s travellers all exterminated and their cus-
tomers annexed by rival soap-makers and all Pears’s
advertising utterly wiped out? What wouldn’t the
name of the extinct Pears be worth to any new co.
that dragged it from the cavern of public memory
and put it again upon posters and cakes of soap ?
Unfortunately, this doesn’t bring us an inch
nearer the solution of the problem of valuing
invisible, intangible assets. Nine times out
of 10 those assets don’t consist of receipted
advertising bills, but do consist merely of
ideas. Thus a caterer awhile ago got a
long lease of city premises, formed himself
into a co., and got nearly 20,000 shares
merely for the lease and the idea he had of
running a business there. Within five years
the co. was in liquidation, and the lease (for
which so much money was paid) was actu-
ally a liability, and not an asset. At least
20 cases of that sort have occurred during
the past three or four years. And money spent
even on advertising is not alw r a.vs an asset.
A few years ago a man arrived from the
U.S.A. in the interests of a bi'eakfast food,
and spent £15,000 to get it on the Aus-
tralian market. He failed, ‘ however, and,
after steadily losing money, his people with-
drew. Three things are needed: Adver-
tising, management, the goods. P. G. Dixon
evidently had tw T o of these essentials; then
“0.T.” Dixon supplied the third, and the
business boomed again. The man who knows
that his co.’s goodwill is worth money gener-
ally feels hurt that The Bulletin elimin-
ates intangible, invisible assets; but there
isn’t any other safe rule to follow. All that
ean be done is to point out the special cir-
cumstances of each case as it arises.

“D.F.”: There is talk of the Zeehan
(Tas.) field being played out, but so far it
has produced over £6,000,000 worth of ore
without being much more than scratched.
One shaft, the Western, is down 1000 feet;
another, the British Montana, is 800 feet;
the rest are all shallow holes, none of them
deeper than 400 feet. All the work now be-
ing done is by tributors, who are sending to
the Sulphide Corporation about £6OOO worth
of ore per month. The mining cos. do noth-
ing and some of them have stated that they
don’t intend to spend any more money on
their leases; the tributors do the work.
Royalty is usually 15 p.c.; and if the find
is really good the co. can take it over at a
valuation. Under Tasmanian mining law
the work of tributors counts as a compliance
with the labor covenants, and the local Par-
liament recently refused to alter this rotten
principle. I he Zeehan field has been par-
ticularly unlucky, for the policy of the
mostfy-Bntish cos. operating there has been
to get all they could and spend as little as
possible on development. Most of the local
people have taken to prayer, their supplica-
tion being that the Mount Lyell Co. will
not only go into the Rosebery-Hercules
amalgamation, but will also take over the
Zeehan smelters and shake things up a bit.
An Adelaide syndicate consisting largely
of railway-contractor Teesdale Smith is
going, into the business of turning scrap-
iron into steel, and has for a start ordered
two modest plants, each with a capacity of
six tons of steel per day. The first is to be
put up in Sydney. The plants are claimed
to be an improvement on the Heroult type
of electric furnace. The co. proposes to put
up plants in all the States, and has an idea
that later it may launch out on a bigger
scale and produce steel from iron ore by the
same process.

Alleged that the Tasmanian State Govern-
ment is on velvet as far as its option over
the Railton-Batrobe Co.’s shale-oil deposits
arc concerned. The option has a couple of
months to run, but if the Government does
nol want, to work the show itself it has had
a “tentative offer” of £25,000 on its bargain.
It all sounds beautiful —all except the “ten-
tative.” Used in any such connection as
this it always makes The Bulletin wonder
if it isn’t a misprint for “tentacle.”

At the end of 1915 12 Westralian gold

from 27,884,168 tons, and five of them
(Great Boulder, Ivanhoe, Golden Horseshoe,
Lake View and Boulder Perseverance),
which adjoin each other at Kalgoorlie, had
nearly half of this production to their
credit. They had also accounted for

The Great Boulder comes out best and South
Kalgurli worst, but the management of the
past few years is not responsible for the
latter’s bad position, and everything possible
has in that time been or is still being done to
make up lost ground. Only two out of the
dozen are mines outside Kalgoorlie, which
makes one pause and think what will become
of the gold industry in the West when most
of the big producers of the Hannan’s Belt
pass away. Two have already done so and
two or three others are tottering to their
death-beds.

Shareholders in the Adelaide-controlled
Golden Point (W.A.) had better prepare for
another disappointment. Two blanks, one
at Westonia and the other in the wilderness
100 miles south of Southern Cross, have
already been drawn, and the co. has now
got hold of a lease known as the Sand Prince
at Comet Yale. A circular issued by the
Board states that the show has the con-
tinuation of the Sand Queen reef, and that
an additional nine acres also on the line of
reef have been secured. What isn’t said in
the circular is that payable values give out
in the Sand Queen some distance from the
Sand Prince boundary, and that the co. has
been offered that portion of the Sand Queen,
12 acres in all, for a few hundred pounds.
The directors are only wasting the remain-
ing funds of the co. in bothering with a
venture such as this. If nothing better is
offering liquidation should take place.
The local paper estimates as the result
of a little figuring that 90,0000 z. of gold
was dug out of the Yilgarn field (W.A.) in
1915. It whoops that in 1911 the total pro-
duction was under 19,0000 z., and that the
yearly increase since has been nearly
lS,ooooz. The place is full of gold, but
extraction is seriously retarded owing to the
dead set made against it by eastern capital-
ists, newspapers and other vermin. As a
matter of cold fact, the gold is there all
right, but in nine cases out of 10 either
values snuff out at a comparatively shallow
depth or the ore gets full of arsenic and
other abominations. Still the field is worth
more attention. #
After another look a Bulletin man has
a word or two more to say about the Edna
May and Central: —•
Edna May’s electric pumps are geing well and
doing well. " An output of 52,000 gallons per hour
was found sufficient to control the flow, and on the
12th inst. the face of the No. 4 level crosscut was
fired after a lapse of seven months. Extra pumps
were put into commission, increasing the lifting
capacity of the whole to 82,000 gallons per hour;
but when the face was blown out it was found
that these emergency drainers were not required*,
which confirmed The Bulletin's assertion of a
couple of months ago that the water would be
beaten without much difficulty. The flow is not
likely to increase as crosscutting proceeds, as the
long diamond-drill holes ahead are draining the reef
as well as the surrounding country rock. So far
as the No. 4 level is concerned the water bogey
may be said no longer to exist. At the Central,
recent developments on an irregular formation
at the No. 1 level south, together with those on
the main reef and alluvial wash, ensure a regular
supply of ore for the mill for some time to come.
Generally the mine is looking better, but the water
danger and costly development at depth are against
the show’s chances of earning much for shareholders.
* * * *
N. S. Stuckey, manager of the Edna
1 Jeeps (W.A.), sticks to his guns that the
talk of water at his mine is bugaboo. Cer-
tainly it looks as if the pumping at the Edna
May is draining the fractured belt between
the face of the 300 ft. crosscut and the
Edna lode. If the flow in the Deeps gives
out, Stuckey’s cement won’t need to set as
hard as a good many people reckoned would
be necessary in order to save Stuckey from
a hasty flight up the shaft. Stuckey’s policy
is to open out for the reef at 480 ft. Doubt-
less backed by Macartney’s slide rule, he
foretells getting on to the reef 15ft. east
of the shaft. Sinking is still miserably
slow, so the market continues to feed on
the board-room congratulations that “the
bore proves that you have one of the most
valuable properties on the field.” If there
had been two bores a Webster’s dictionary
wouldn’t have satisfied the demand of Pea-
cock’s staff for big talk. The Deeps mine
had mopred up £18.500 to the end of
November, represented by the famous No. 1
bore, some pumping plant, a second-hand
battery, a shaft 300 ft. deep with its cross-
cut, and an entry in the ledger of £7500
that flowed to vendors and promoters.
* * * *
To help Hansel Monday, the Bendigo pros-
pecting venture into which the Chaffinch
money was put when the Bullfinch patch
(W.A.) petered out, Minister Livingstone
puts up £ for £ to the tune of £2500. The
feeling in Adelaide over the withholding of
aid for the show was nasty, as the Chaffinch
cash was only put into the Bendigo side-line
block on the understanding that it would
have some State help in prospecting. Now
all the cauliflowers in the garden are bloom-
ing again.
* * * *
Still more bulletins about new Langi
Logan. At the half-yearly meeting Ilarry
Dodd did a songandance over the near ces-
sation of calls. Those who took him seri-
ously fell in, as every item in Manager
Toole’s latest prescription spells more calls
till the Cathcart gutter can be properly
worked. To do that Toole must put in at
least a couple of months driving till he
touches the Central boundary. There he will
be able to stope vigorously, leaving the
worked-out ground to close up behind him.
All would be well if men were plentiful.
But they’re short of supply because of the
war and because surface work is pleasanter
than grubbing in mud. Toole’s next job
should be to push out the branch drive
from No. 2 shaft to get under the Langi
gutter. That would help the South Langi
by proving the value of the gutter below its
junction with the Cathcart; but Toole would
also tap the water a long way up the gutter
and in his No. 1 shaft workings. There
will be an Edna May stream to play with,
but with two shafts pumping he ought to
get the pressure down smartly. Meantime,
according to the Argus, Toole is out for
“most economical mining.” No one know-
ing him expects him to pay big union wages
and not make a big struggle to get value.
* * * *
The oracle has spoken into the ear of
Minister of Mines Livingstone that the bor-
ing at 1400 ft. of the Magdala, Stawell
(Vic.), by Dick Hamilton’s Great Boulder
staff, hasn’t given the additional 2dwt. he
wants assured to recommend venturing
£lOO,OOO in the claim. So a grant is to be
made by the State to help unwater the old
mine to 1600 ft. Victorian shows outside
Bendigo generally shade off quickly below
1000 ft., so the betting isn’t 4 to 1 on Stawell
ever having Hamilton as a paying guest.
R. W. Stringer’s little Austral-Siamese
kitten is now the full-blown Ronpibon Tin,
No Liability. Eric Moore, of the Byron
Moore blood, was the examining-engineer, just
as he was of the Tongkah Compound. So
when he thumped down his approval
Stringer felt that luck w T as at full flood.
But his pot even then wasn’t up to the brim.
He next got A. W. Palfreyman to under-
write the issue of 52,000 shares at a time
when hard cash counts. Next he just got
in ahead of Attorney-General Hughes’s
announcement that capital mustn’t go out-
side Australia for investment. The capital
of the new show is £85,000 in £1 shares.
Of these 25,000 go as fully paid to
Stringer’s co-optors; 1000 ditto to Eric
Moore, presumably in payment for his re-
port ; and 2000 to Palfreyman as part con-
sideration for his underwriting. The said
jam-king’s obligation is to provide 4s. per
share on the 52.000 subscribing scrip for a
brokerage of 6d. and a com. of 6d. per
share apart from the paid-ups already re-
ferred to. Thus he parts with £10.400 but
gets back £2OOO in shares and £2600 in com-
mission, or a 25 per cent, return for his
kindness. Stringer’s syndicate hands over
two Chinese claims, for which it pays £3565
cash and 1470 shares, and further provides
two prospecting areas of 500 acres each for
the new co. Eric Moore’s word is passed
that his samples from eight shafts—on one
of these blocks —averaged 11b. 12oz. tin
oxide, that this ore is of good quality, that
clay won’t trouble and that boulders won’t
cause bad language. No wonder Palfrey-
man cut in.
* * * *
“E.D.” : “Veritas” (B. 23/12/’15) praises
the gold fossicker as a helper in opening up
fields. As far as Westralia is concerned lie
is more than often the means of condemning
a gold-bearing area. Since cheap crushing
at the State batteries became almost uni-
versal, the fossicker neither works his area
properly nor sells out at a reasonable figure.
Instead, he burrows about after rich patches
till he has created a rabbit warren. When
he is done with it the ground is no good to
anyone. A good set of mining regulations
properly enforced would prevent this. Ap-
parently nothing else will.

SCOTS | WH ISKY
A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, January 24. 1916.
.My Dear Arinj,—
The last day of the Trade Fair brought
the Third Battalion dames into action as
caterers. Mrs. Soutar and Mrs. Philip
Street mothered the outbreak. The Third
was one of the early-bird battalions in Gal-
lipoli that caught the Turkish shell.
Colonel Bob Owen, who commanded it, is
still suffering from the interchange of com-
pliments, by the way. He survived the civic
welcome in his native town, Wollongong,
but has had to lay up in Randwick Hospital
since then. The Turks, and not the local
oratory, are responsible. D. V. Mulholland,
the Ashfield man who recently won a com-
mission at immortal Anzac, belongs to the
Third.
Now that the Trade Fair’s shutters are
■up one hopes that the Chamber of Commerce
will put more vim into its next effort.
Budge, in “Helen’s Babies,” was regarded by
an exhausted uncle as a sticky infant with
a delirious mania to “see the wheels go
round.” Yet the ’Murkan baby represented
the adult public’s passion for movement.
Women’s Exhibitions in the Town Hall —
those that draw —keep their business eyes
on the Budges of the world. They make
Ihe wheels go round. This knocks out the
excuse that the Town Hall is “unsuitable”
for live machinery. It is, of course, not
Ihe place for a ploughing match. But Ger-
man ploughs are negligible rivals to Aus-
tralian “stump-jumpers.” The morgue-like
effect of an exhibition which can only make
a noise with a gramophone doomed the
Trade Fair as an advertisement. Even
President George Parkes, running up the
seams of a suit of Red Cross pyjamas on
a local sewing-machine, would have done
something to stir the pulse of the show.
This year’s Anniversary Day Regatta
merely serves up a few bones of the old-
time marine feasts. A good many of the
yachtsmen are doing patrol work in the
grey North Sea or elsewhere as required.
Flagships of yesteryear are tramping the
ocean with reinforcements and stores, so
that a mere ferry-boat is pressed into the
service. The races are to be en suite. You
might almost as well stay home and turn the
heel of the latest pair.
Rumor says that Society brought its heav-
iest guns to bear on Governor Strickland in
hopes of persuading him to veto the appoint-
ment of R. D. Meagher as Lord Mayor, and
that the delay in the announcement was
really due to this fact. Meagher and his
friends raised the siege by a fierce frontal
attack on the Ministerial forces, with the
result that the position was carried amid a
cloud of asphyxiating gas. The Really Nice
People are now going on to mention things
to the Colonial Office, and a social blockade
of the Lord and Lady Mayoress is said to
have been proclaimed.
“Harry” Budge, Official Secretary to the
State Government, has been appointed clerk
to the Governor-in-Council, a job held for
many years by his father, A. C. Budge.
Father in his day found the Executive
Council enough to look after, but of late
years the billet has been tacked on to other
offices and a recent juggling landed it on
the junior Budge’s doormat.
Word from Wellington says Chief Rail-
way Commissioner Harper’s white whiskers
are blowing about the gardens there. Under
Mrs. Harper’s eye he will probably spend
three months or so in Maoriland, mostly in
the South, struggling after the health which
45 years of strenuous railway labor robbed
him of. It was strenuous, some of it. In
Railway Chief Eddy’s days John Harper
was put on to the job of re-organising the
station staffs, and averaged 50,000 miles a
year for six dusty, droughty years.
Rumor, which has been making dizzy
flights round the Conservatorium appoint-
ments, has now fled before fact. The local
article gets more prestige than cash. The
three importations—two fiddlers and a ’cell-
ist —will be on a better footing. But that,
of course, is to be expected. Still, our long-
haired tribe, being hard pressed by the war,
are glad to pick up a crust out of the
mangers from which Governors’ horses once
fed
It is not the time to be extra-critical about
Verbrugghen’s choice of teachers. Mrs.
Slapoffski certainly knows what she’s about
in the vocal business. Roland Foster, the
mild young man who stayed here after tour-
ing as secretary with the massive Butt team,
may be a high-class singing master. We
have yet to find out by results. Phillip
Wilson, a young English tenor, now resident
here, is promising stuff. But he carries
restraint to a pinnacle in his own vocal
methods. Albert Goossens, a Belgian with
an operatic reputation, and Nelson Illing-
worth are included in the crop of singing-
masters. So is a recently-arrived Greek,
•T. Mavrogordato. I’m told the war sent
him this way. He left his native shore in
infancy, and took root in London. For
years he has taught singing in that hubbub.
Coming to the pianists, Yvonne Charvin’s
appointment was of course inevitable. Frank
Hutchens, originally from little Hawera, in
Maoriland, had a training at the Royal
Academy of Music, and got away with vari-
ous prizes. Possibly these two are the pick
of the new piano-teaching staff.
Lottie Dearn, the Carmichaels’ clever
proteged (the public, by the way, handed over
the cash for her trip), has come back from
England. She was in Germany, learning
its tricks on the keyboard, when the world
began to go up in smoke; so her studies
came to a broken end in London. Lottie
is too immature to be ranked amongst Con-
servatorium teachers. But it was almost a
foregone conclusion she’d get there. Assist-
ant-teacher is the promising student’s billet.
Iris de Cairos Rego gets a similar
job. Cyril Monk and W. J. Coad are satis-
factory appointments. And Alfred Hill as
professor of the skeleton of music will
please the taxpayer who can for the
moment forget that it’s all going to cost
money.
A foothold is found, too, for Holman,
senior, father of the Premier. Holman pere
is an old man and associated with a bygone
theatrical art. But he knows more about
elocution than most young mummers; and
you can tell what he is like as a teacher by
the way he trained his son—trained
him so that he can make the worse
appear the better reason and generally be a
danger and a disaster. After their experi-
ence with Holman quite a lot of people
think that, if we have a Professor of Elocu-
tion, we ought also to have a Demonstrator
in Sandbagging and a Lecturer in the Gentle
Art of Poisoning. Anyway, one accomplish-
ment seems scarcely less perilous than the
others.
The director of the Conservatorium has
had a hard row to hoe in choosing his staff.
The politician has been pulling strings for his
own friends and digging pits for his enemies,
and for years and years the bad beginning
will be hard to live down. If Verbrugghen
has got a speckled and piebald team, he at
least knows what he knows—which is a
good deal more than he knew when he
landed.
Noo Yark press bursts into full bloom
concerning Percy Grainger. “Tawny-
haired” —his locks were pale gold a few
years ago—“youthful, and full of the joy
of living, he makes music amusing.” The
’Murkan who thus describes the Australian
pianist, was recovering from an orgy of
heavyweights. “If you are a music critic,”
he. says, “you will feel a tingling down your
spine, and think. ‘At last a personality and
something new !’ ” Pause for breath. “He
radiates light and sweetness for a few
moments —you feel he is yours!” But
musicians can swallow much stiffer doses of
treacle than this, and, anyway, Percy’s
chaperoning mamma can water it down if
Golden Locks isn’t feeling strong.
The performance which caused four col-
umns of such phrases did make “music
amusing.” In the middle of it Percy stopped,
used a swear word, and climbed down into
the audience to borrow a knife. He evi-
dently knew his audience. So he chatted
to it and told it that a key of the piano
was stuck. He knifed that key three times
that evening. The concert was a huge suc-
cess. “No doubt,” says the critic naively,
“the expletive helped somewhat.”
. Electrical-engineer R. V. Morse, about
six feet two in his knitted socks, goes to
the Front with the Mining Engineers lot.
Professor David —now a Major or some-
thing—will be in this scientific squad. Morse,
who married a sister of G. G. Neill, of the
Tourist Bureau, learnt his trade in Lan-
cashire works. I think it was with the
Dick Kerr firm. Viv Bennett, one of the
Evening News sprouts, has gone into the
same camp. He learned his business at
Broken Hill, and has spent most of his
working years in Mexico.
The Mining Corps Comforts’ Depot, by the
way, is still in its infancy. The committee
meets this week to lick business into shape.
Australians—-bless ’eon —are everywhere
in the firing-line. Major Laverack, one of
our younger Garrison Artillery officers, was
going through a gunnery course at Wool-
wich when Europe caught fire. The War
Office snapped him up for a while. Then he
got into business with a British regiment in
France. The last news of him was from
Servia, whither he went with the second
British army. Young Tomkinson, a sub. of
the same R.A.G.A., is with British artillery
in France. He left here with the siege guns,
which for months were apparently glued to
Lydd, where the explosives come from.
Two senior subs, in the Permanent Artil-
lery—Lieuts. Kelly and Brown —have
wheedled the necessary permits to go to the
Front. Just now they’re growing wings at
the Commonwealth Aviation School. Later,
when their feathers are strong enough,
they’ll fly to Europe with some of the older
birds.
Capt. Geoffrey McLaughlin, of the lawyer-
.Tohn McLaughlins, and an old Aloysius boy,
has got his D.S.O. He was on Gallipoli
from the fourth day after the Gaba Tepe
landing until November, in the Field Artil-
lery ; then he was invalided to Malta and is
now in Egypt. As observing officer his work
directed such accurate shell-fire as anni-
hilated companies of Turks, so that an ad-
miring French officer remarked that the Aus-,
tralian could hand-throw a shell at a Turk
and kill him three miles off.
The four Chisholm sisters, of Goulburn,
have taken a house at Neutral Bay. They’re
blessed with a comfy incomp, and devote a
fair share of it and all their time ,to Red
Cross work. Their record of knitting a
hundred pair of socks apiece is only a side-
line to their other breathless activities. Yet
400 soldiers have been well toed and heeled
as a result.
Re toes, the snacks of knitters’. remarks
one picks up in the tram have a weird effect
on stout citizens. The latter, Paring over
an evening paper, evidently think in > e
pussies are at it again !” But they re doing
nothing of the kind; they’re merely saying,
“What! Lady Blank’s toe? I wouldn t
touch her toe'! Give me Nell Flyaway s toe
and Mrs. Busy’s heel —they're the thing.
Then a treble from tbe corner: “B e had one
experiment with Lady Blanks toe! Never
again! Now, she’s taken it with her to
England—perhaps they’ll stand it, though it
is all lumps!” '
Mary Marlowe, the slender, grey-eyed Aus-
tralian girl who was here a few years ago in
the Bert Bailey team, sends a ream from
N’York. She’s been acting in “Peg o My
Heart” in the States. Pirie Bush, the M.L.
young man who did so well in the Niblo
cast here, was in the same bill. The Aus-
tralian girl took a holiday in London last
English spring, and was one of the 15 mil-
lions who just missed a tragedy. “I booked
by the Lusitania, but could only get a very
uncomfortable berth, so transferred at the
last moment to a slower steamer, the Lap-
land. We got into Liverpool one hour after
the tragedy of the Lusitania. We had
seemed So intimate with her on the way
across, and expected her to race ahead of us
into port... .1 was detained in Liverpool for
some hours as a suspect, for I had no pass-
port. They didn’t believe the holiday story.
Fortunately the clergy do go to the theatres
sometimes. In Liverpool I was able to find
one who recognised me, having seen me act-
ing there years ago, so I was sent off
happy. After having been fed for
months on such headlines as ‘London in
Flames,’ I was astonished to find the big city
so calm that the same old spring cleaning
was going on with the same old persistence.”
The making of munitions by women has
brought in some new factory rules. “Posi-
tively no hairpins” is one. So the lady who
has leonine locks has to wear them braided
and tied together by a ribbon. And no metal
buttons either.
Kathleen Kingston, a pretty niece of the
late Australian statesman C. C. Kingston,
is playing lead in a London theatre. If
she’s a niece she’s a daughter of Charley’s
brother “Paddy.” Latter, an eccentric fel-
low of good looks, married one of the Stan-
ton marms who for years taught the young
ladies of S. Australia the polite accomplish-
ments, including much Church of England
catechism and a little archery.
Coiffures dragged up to a towering cone
are shown in the latest fashion plates. So
are helmet hats. These are designed in
Paris, and are a cross between Minerva’s
best sunbonnet and a Tod Sloan cap. The
arched crown has a prickly-pear growing
out of its curved summit. But neither the
millinery nor the dragged-up locks to fit
it have yet appeared on the marble brows
of our Best People.
It was a surprise to hear that Mrs.
David’s warcry in Drummoyne was her
first excursion in an election .campaign. The
fluent ’Varsity dame has, at any rate, been
holding forth for years on almost every sub-
ject under the sun, and her recent early-
closing manifesto was a political challenge.
The pity of it is that most women who want
to reform the world end up with nerves like
broken fiddle-strings. Whereupon the World
wags its wicked old head and fills its cup
again.
Some time or other some infuriated con-
cert-manager will tell Phil Newbury a few
hard facts. The plump tenor was adver-
tised to sing in the concert arranged for
the benefit of St. Vincent’s party the other
evening. The euchre enthusiasts who filled
the big balconies would have gone on at
their games till morn. But the jangle of
bells told another tale at 9.30. Non-card-
players who had been cooling off, after a
sultry day, on the lawn, strolled in. too, to
hear Newbury. And almost of course he didn’t
turn up! The rest of the concert party
fidgeted and said things—and the city
chimes rang the three-quarters. Then the
remote-suburban section fled for its ferry
boat.
The Nurses’ Home in St. Vincent’s Hos-
pital, for which the cash was raised the
other night, is a model which Australian hos-
pitals might copy. Built around a hollow
square, it encloses a velvet lawn. A foun-
tain —when the Sydney water-supply can
stand the strain —and a family of goldfish
are all that’s necessary now. Of course
there’s a long bill, but that will be paid bv
degrees. At each corner of the top terrace
of this mansion of the blest there’s an open,
airy room. Here the operating-theatre
nurses, likely to be called up at any moment,
sleep, while a cool sea-breeze tosses their
hair. Last week’s euchre party was a huge
success but for the defection of Newbury.
And that didn’t hurt the collection.
A boy back from Cairo tells me that if
there’s a refreshment-room in Australia run
on the lines of Groppi’s he wants its address
You enter and lift a plate and cake-fork
from a table close to the door, wander round
amongst the trays, and harpoon anything
that, takes your fancy. This you pay the
cashier for, and walk through into the gar-
den, where there are tables and chairs & set
out under the palms. A suave bowing waiter
is quickly in attendance, and on getting your
oidei for tea or whatever it is rushes
away and you are served in next to no time
You pay the waiter for the liquid part of the
programme —not forgetting his little bit of
backsheesh.
Snowy Baker is backing up the War
Chest’s prayer for sports-stuff by promising
a hundred sets of boxing gloves for our boys
in Egypt; and school kiddies are sending
cricket-bats and balls to the same address.
The local policeman and his pal the fire-
man are working up their annual carnival.
An art union is a reasonable excuse to
swell the profits this year. The big sports
come off in the breezy Agricultural Grounds
on Feb. 26. The cheque will be divided
amongst the hungry hospitals.
The 13th Battalion committee has had a
split. A few seceders have floated out and
will probably run their own show in their
own way. The old original firm still hangs
out its sign in the same place—Bull’s Cham-
bers, Moore-street. The Army Service Corps
has a similar rent in its body. But, as a
rule, the ladies who go out with arched
backs are not mourned by the majority that
stands to its covenant. The boys in khaki
generally get their bit out of the melee,
anyhow.
Lieut. Reg. Howard, who left for the
Front as soon as the word came, was first
quietly wed to Doris Gardiner at St.
Andrew’s Cathedral. Comrades in khaki
lined up to make the usual avenue of clink-
ing steel. Then a cake was cut at the Went-
worth, and a hurried motor-trip to the South
Coast led on to the embarkation.
The Makura last week took off the R.
E. Joneses, of Mosman. The Jones who
pays the family’s bills came this way four
or five years ago as Australian manager for
the Collins firm which has been making
schoolbooks since grandmother’s day. Now
most or all of the several Coilins brothers
are at the Front, and the Australian man
has been called back from sunshine to the
dreadful gloom of Glasgow, and the family,
which had almost turned itself into several
salamanders, has gone too.
An elderly party in a khaki uniform came
into a soldiers’ rest-house the other day. The
first person he saw was a young man sitting
in a chair, his feet up against the wall, read-
ing a newspaper. “How are you getting
on?’’ asked the stranger. The young man
looked up from his War Cry and grinned
affably. “Aw, orriglit,” he answered.
“Wounded in the leg?’’ asked the visitor.
“Ankle,” said the soldier, without lowering
the sheet. “Ah,” murmured the interested
one. The soldier grinned again over the
top of his defences. “Good-morning,” said
the caller, and passed on. “Morn’!” returned
the soldier, and dipped into his paper once
more. Presently another party in khaki
came along. “Don’t you know who that
was?” lie demanded of the youth behind the
newspaper. The lad cocked an eye over the
edge. “Null,” he answered. “Well,” said
the other, “that was the Governor-General!”
The young man lowered the newspaper two
inches. “Well, ’e seems a kind ol’ feller
orright,” he remarked, and fell into his news-
paper again. And there you’ve got the
typical Australian soldier, noticing only the
human quality in the man who had passed,
and profoundly unmoved by the mention of
the magnificence of the man’s job.
Lieut. Jack Lacey went off last week to
do his bit. Before leaving he got the right
answer from Edith Scraggs, a Mosman girl.
It seems a pity to change that name. There's
only one Scraggs in the Sydney Directory,
and poor Melbourne doesn’t own even that
many 7. Another Mosman damsel, Aileen
Corden, accepted a ring from Lieut. Daniel.
He’s in Egypt now.
Did you know that the “Australian shill-
ing” (I don’t mean Ivy who now spells her
name that way) is shied at by London
tradesmen? Some Kangaroos got the sur-
prise of their lives when they found the
King’s head turned down in the King’s
dominions. They forgot that it wasn’t the
stamp that made the guinea, but the
“goud.” And even a king’s head won’t make
sevenpenn’orth of silver worth a shilling. If
it would what an easy way Australia would
have to pay its debts!
Autumn fashions have not yet been opened,
thank goodness. But the time is almost
ripe for sweltering woman to raise her eyes
languidly on fur-trimmed w 7 raps suitable for
an Esquimau Society leader. Velvet is
threatened almost immediately.
Sir F. W. Stopford, of the Gwenadiah
Guards, having set a precedent in asking
permission to sue Sir lan Hamilton for
defamation of character over the Suvla Bay
fiasco, we may shortly expect to hear of one
general officer issuing an information against
another for language calculated to provoke
a breach of the peace, or a commander suing
an admiral for navigating without lights.
From this it will be but a step to charging
the captain of a submarine with having
been half seas over, or even drunk in charge
of a ship and crew. The nearest approach
to these proceedings is the time-honored
sensation of the Fifth Act, where the mid-
shipmite heaves his dirk at his superior
officer’s head, demanding a court-martial,
and everything is done brass-bound and in
order. If recourse to the civil law he
allowed in these matters, the Bab Ballads
had better never have been written, and it
will be only a matter of time until the
British Army has the bailiffs in for rent.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

When You Can't Sleep.
Amongst sufferers from insomnia there are j
many who complain to their doctors that
when they are about their work or sitting
still, they can hardly resist the tendency to
go to sleep, but the moment they lay their
heads upon the pillow they cannot g t to
sleep. This condition is usually met with
in ansemie, debilitated people. An eminent
practitioner explains the cause of this. The
vessels of the brain, having lost their tone,
cannot contract and regulate the flow of
blood through the brain. When one in this
condition is in an upright position the upper
parts of the body, and more particularly the
brain, owing to the laxity of the vessels, are
drained of blood. But when the patient lies
down the reverse is the case, and the blood
flows' too freely through the brain and the
imagination is excited. In such cases it is
necessary to restore tone by the use of
tonics, and it is advisable for anyone who
is debilitated and run down to take a course
of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. They increase
the blood supply and impart tone to the
whole system. Sleep becomes sounder and
more refreshing, your worries become less and
your work lighter. The whole action of
these pills is to assist nature to restore
the body to normal activity. They do not
contain any narcotic. Your nearest _ dealer
can supply you with Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills at the price they have always been.
Free.—A useful booklet, “Diseases of
the Blood,” will be sent free to any applicant
who sends a request to the Dr. Williams’
Medicine Co., Sydney.— Advt.
Poisons Turned Loose.
Fermentation and putrefaction are con-
stantly taking place in the digestive tract
and poisons are constantly being formed.
Provision has been made to take _ care of
these poisons, but when the liver is torpid
and the bowels constipated they find their
way into the circulation and much mischief
follows. A coated tongue, headache and
eruptions result.
The use of the gentle laxative pills, Pink-
ettes, will not only banish these unpleasant
symptoms quickly but, if used regularly for
a reasonable time, will really correct
chronic constipation.
Pinkettes contain no poisons or harmful
drugs.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, January 24, 1916.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Lady Helen Ferguson called a Women’s
meeting at the Town Hall one night last
week to discuss how much more help women
could give in the great crisis. Ten minutes
after the scheduled hour of meeting the
doors were closed and late-comers full of
zeal were met by an uncompromising blank
wall. Some scurried round and pleaded at
the side entrances with no success, and
even the knowing ones who burrowed
underneath the building and tried the cellars
were blocked by stern male attendants.
“Hall full” was what they said. What the
people inside did really wouldn’t interest
you. You know just the. sort of things a
meeting like this would decide to do.
What nobody proposed was that the sex,
from the flapper upwards, should leave off
giving the glad eye to the “desirable” young
male who isn’t in khaki.
One of “Tith’s” last requests was so
characteristic of the lovable man. He knew
what funerals are, and he would have hated
to listen to the usual panegyric. Yet he
couldn’t close the mouths of those who
would talk about his virtues. So the grate-
ful, modest man did the next best thing—
he asked that the service in the church
might be the occasion for him to express
the thanks he felt to his friends for all their
acts of kindness.
British officers don’t disguise their pity
for the sons of suburban snobs in
the Commonwealth who, either on their
own initiative or as the result of
family pressure, turn up their noses
at the heroic Australian regiments and en-
list in dear old Hingland; and things are
not made so rosy for the deserters as they
expected. Recently a wail reached here from
one of our heavily-gilded bachelors. After
getting into the trappings of a second lieu-
tenant in the hundred and first battalion of
a swagger British regiment, it was so
arranged that he had to salute and
take orders from his ex-valet, who had got
there six months before him. The tragedy
is that the wretched victim had gone to the
Fog to escape any chance of being ordered
about by his “inferiors” at Broadmeadows
camp!
The Western district, following the lead
of “dear Lady Dudley,” has got out
a cookery-book to help a patriotic notion.
All the Very Naicest women have supplied
their pet recipes, and- Mrs. Willie Moffat, of
Berrambool, is organiser or editress. The
Broughtons o* Warrnambool and the Brough-
tons of 1 lamilton have several pages to
themselves. “Gr&Rjie’s Jelly” and “Great-
Grannie’s Elderberry Wine ” and such fam-
ily heirlooms of the pantry figure in their
list, the Broughtons being worshippers of
Family and Domestic Traditions and all that
sort of thing. The Austins of Geelong, the
Austins of Farther West, the Laidlaws of
Hamilton, Bella Golding of Lake Bolac, and
the Fentons of the Western district (artistic
and Very Rich) also give away a lot of
secrets, but none of them have explained how
to boil potatoes successfully in a bottomless
billy. The art-green bound production will
cost you three and sixpence, Yarrie.
Dainty Marie Hall, the J. B. Watson
heiress, who is spending her time in London
cheering up wounded soldiers and dodging
Zep. cargo, has, according to that unreliable
busybody Rumor, consented to pluck the
orange blossom for the sake of one Jack
Russell, brother of Mabel, an English
comedy favorite. Marie’s pal, Maude
Gregory, is with her and had fixed up a visit
to Lord Burnham, who is a kinsman of
the Gregorys, when the old sport upset
the arrangements by dying. It was quite
unintentional on his part.
This new fashion of allowing the public
into one’s private grounds for patriotic sprees
has its amusing results. One haughty
Toorakian dame who had opened her garden
for a f£te slipped away from the heat and
the work into her shady morning-room for
a quiet cup of tea. There she came upon
two strange cats, who did not know their
hostess, critically examining the contents of
the room. “Humph!” ejaculated one,
“there’s some good stuff here, but it’s mostly
rubbish.” The unnoticed hostess sent a
draught of iced air down the invaders’ back
with: “The furniture is not for sale,'madam.
If you wish to buy anything, please go out
to the bazaar stalls in the garden.”
Now that Mrs. Drake-Brockman has
taken her major back to Perth, assistant-
secretary Margaret Littlejohn-—a daughter
of the Scotch College doctor —has been pro-
moted to the secretaryship of Mrs. Hen-
nessy’s Patriotic League, which is up to its
energetic neck in a sea of soldiers’ comforts
at the Town Hall. The League does what
the Red Cross doesn’t try to do. While the
latter is attending to the sick and wounded
the Town Hall toilers are doing something
worth while for the men still in the field or
on the way there. They have just sent
away some 500 cases of warm clothing and
handy-sized eatables to Egypt; and up to
date 80,000 sandbags have also been for-
warded. Now they are gathering an assort-
ment of sports material for the camps
abroad. At the enlisting depot, too, tney
provide fruit and soft-stuff for the young
man waiting his turn for examination ; and
they do what they can to supply the troop-
ships with those little things which mean a
lot during a long voyage. Beatrice Henty
fills the bustling billet of honorary superin-
tendent with neatness and despatch; and
the swarms of helpers are so busy some
days that they hardly have time for after-
noon-tea.
George Stewart, after helping to pass
around writing-pads and tinned pineapples
in Egypt on behalf of the Women’s Patriotic
League which works at the Melbourne Town
Hall, is on his way back to Melbourne;«
but Henry Budden, the Sydney architect
who is the League’s commissioner in Egypt
and also represents the N.S.W. War Chest
there, has several Melbourne assistants still
on the spot. These include George Chirn-
side, of Werribee Park, and Stanley Wood-
burn, who helps keep the ancient family
store in the Dunkeld sheep-country. Henry
Budden has just sent the League a huge
cable, detailing how the Christmas billies
and packets were passed around and given
a succession of loud cheers.
The Harry Hentys’ lad, Edric, who left
for Hendon some time ago with the price
of an aeroplane in his vest-pocket and some
knowledge of internal-combustion engines,
has cabled mother that he is through his
exams, in the theory and practice of avia-
tion, and is now a flight-lieutenant with a
heart for any fate, flight or fight.
The widow of late General Hoad is in
Melbourne, after a visit to Mrs. “Ossy”
Hoad and grandchild in the Apple Island.
Son Audrey, who was twice wounded and
invalided to England, is again taking a
haqd in Franco-Britisli doings at the Front.
Captain “Ossy” is on leave in Tasmania
with wifie and babe.
Aileen Whiting, who, while anxiously
waiting for news from her soldier lad in
Mesopotamia, put in some strenuous work
with the Mayoress’s Red Cross organisa-
tion at the Town Hall, is now strenuously
packing prior to hurrying off to marry Cap-
tain Walker in Egypt. The Whiting girl,
if pressed, would have to stick the follow-
ing on her passport form; Good-looking,
dresses well, acts, sings, and wields a clever
caricaturist’s pencil.
At secluded and truly-rural Clifton
Springs, where the big hotel has been turned
into a hospital for convalescent soldiers,
there is plenty of open country. The Rivers-
dale golfers have come forward with a pile
of golfing goods; and now the less maimed
military at the Springs may be seen any day
at diligent practice on the cliff-top.
When the Melbourne housewife has a few
minutes to spare from getting the dinner,
interviewing the grocer’s lad, going to the
movies and receiving Mrs. Jaggers-Jones in
the draw-hawing-room, it sometimes occurs
to her to wonder why, with flour down to
twelve-ten a ton, bread has only fallen a
farthing a pound. But, of course, the Price
of Goods Board has proved that it is im-
possible to interfere with the natural course
of the baking trade; and therefore all is
peace in the bakeries. The fact that the
Defence Department gets its soldiers’ bread
for about a penny-farthing a pound, as
against the housewife’s tuppence, is a mere
detail that nobody has any business to men-
tion. Least of all the housewife, she being
merely a woman.
Mrs. Rupert Downes and Miss Eileen
Hughes are resting for a week or two at
Macedon. They are joint secretaries of the
Friendly Union of Soldiers’ Wives and
Mothers, which was instituted four or five
months ago by Lady Helen Ferguson. Their
substitutes at the inquiry office, 21 Queen’s
Walk, are available from two till four-daily
to help out of any difficulties the womenfolk
of the men who are on the national job.
Lady Helen keeps in close touch, and she
has little parties at Government House
occasionally to draw members together. They
just love drawing together at the big white
house by the Yarra.
Shepparton purposes a patriotic carnival
on February 8 and 9, and the ladies of the
district, who are arranging a sale of gifts,
invite any Victorians who cannot be present
to send articles to help the good cause. The
thanks of the committee and secretary John
Stubbs are offered in advance.
Dolly Castles, neatly mended and patched
in an East Melbourne hospital, departed for
Sydney in a railway carriage that looked like
a flower-carnival prize-car. She was off for
America to catch up with some engagements
delayed by illness.
Not much from the Adelaide cousin this
week :—■
The Cheer-Up Society is organising an Egyptian
“carnival,” in aid of its own and the Wounded
Soldiers’ Association Funds, for the last day of this
month and the first of next. The star attraction
was advertised as “real Egyptian pillage, as wit-
nessed by our soldiers.” The ntention was vil
lage,” but the printer had been there. There are to
be facsimile representations of other things
Egyptian wedding procession, trench defence
bomb-throwing, for instance.
The appointment of Judge Murray to the Chiet
Justiceship, and the consequent moving up of Judge
Buchanan and Professor Jethro Brown, has saved a
good many people from the nervous prostration that
was threatening them on account of their own possi
ble —or impossible —chances. The choice of Judge
Murray is a popular one, not because lie is what is
usuallv described as “popular” himself he's too re-
served for that —but because he is as widely respected
as any man in S. Australia. Judge Gor on
consulted his health, turned the offer down, and
departed thankfully to his Kangaroo Island cottage
to finish his vacation. Incidentally, Judge Murray
is a bachelor, and has never shown any signs of
wanting to be anything else. He was the late G.J. s
associate when he was much younger.
There is no end to our woes. We know, of course,
that the drought has broken and that we are to
have a superlative season, but the fact remains that
scarcely a teacup of rain has fallen since Septem-
ber, and there is a vegetable shortage in consequence.
The cabbage with the snail-holes in it is 4s. a dozen
at market, and potatoes recently took a wild leap
upwards and landed at £'l4 a ton.
There are bitter words over the Wounded Soldiers’
Fund and the billet of chairman. Ex-Mayor Simpson
still holds the position, in spite of acrimonious sug-
gestions from some people that it w T as as mayor, and
not as Mr. Simpson, he was appointed, and that he
should vacate the seat of honor in favor of present-
Mayor Isaacs. Mr. Simpson’s supporters contend that
he was elected as himself, and not as any official.
Meanwhile the wounded soldiers, who are the people
most concerned, remain calm.
Ebenezer Ward, who was a colleague of S. J. Way’s
in the only Ministry the late Chief Justice was ever
in, lives now in Westralia. At 78 he is still writing
articles for the press, particularly in regard to its
agricultural and pastoral possibilities. In his time
his ink was as acid as that of any pen in the 'Com-
monwealth.
And they tell us we must practise rigid economy!
A carrier plying between Mount Gambier and Port
Mac Donnell discovered a fire in his trolly at the
precise moment when he was furthest from houses
and from any chance of water. The only liquid
available was a cask of beer that formed part of the
cargo—and, well, what could the poor man do ?
Ex-Attorney-General Denny, M.L.A., has got his
commission—in the 9th Light Horse —and will leave
shortly with reinforcements. Captain Eric Conran,
of the Flying Corps, has been given his majority,
and is at the Central Flying School, Upavon, Wilt-
shire. He was at the Front for about a year, and
went to England badly wounded, with a mention in
despatches to his credit and the Military Cross.
Irene Palmer, Rosina Carandini Palmer’s
girl, who some years ago started a paying-
guestery at Bonalbo, the big Were house in
Lower Toorak, lately fell to pieces through
doing too much for her living, and has had
to be put together again at a private hospi-
tal. Not much is heard from Mamma Rosina
these days, of course; but for many years
she was Melbourne’s most persistent concert
singer, and has driven Annie Laurie right
home oftener than any other balladist in
Australia. The singer passed much of her
beauty to her children, convalescent Irene
included.
Charles Chapman, the mining man, has
thus far been assisted by his wife to hand
over no less than three motor-cars to the
Red Cross. Two of these, a Fiat and a
Benz, were given the other day for use in
Australia; the third has been at work
in Egypt for some time. The idea is to use
the latest pair for taking returned invalids
around for a breeze when no private Cars
are available, and for ordinary Red Cross
work. The Charlie Chapman vehicles will
nil a long-felt want.
“Rosna” tells me from London that she
lately discovered, concealed in a military
hospital at Woolwich, Private Gordon Simp-
son, Ist Battalion, A.I.F. Until he went to
live in Sydney a year or two ago lawyer
Gordon Simpson was one of Adelaide’s best-
known Sassiety bachelors, and there’s no
evidence he ever did anything more strenu-
ous than the Block. Yet he had seven weeks’
strenuous bomb-throwing In the trenches at
Lonesome Tine, with a few thrills as season-
lng. And the debonair young man came
through it all proud of having been just an
unfrilled Kangaroo.
Matrimonial items from “Rosna”:
A few hours after George Rex had handed George
Reid the Grand Cross of the Bath Bun, or some-
thing of that sort, daughter Thelma got into her
wedding frock and hurried off to St. Columba’s,
where Mr Hymen and Mr. Leonard Swainson Cleaver
were waiting for her. The subsequent proceeding
were entirely without frills, the Reids being fn
mourning for a sister.
Another coalition just arranged is that of the
Maonland Arthur Rhodeses’ daughter Rose to Capt
Woi T' F “ n Who ohases Huns with the Royal
Welsh Fusiliers. This also was the popular quiet
wedding to which nobody is invited and everybody
comes so to speak; and the pair left at once for
their home in Nottingham.

Anything which it is fashionable to do the
Sassiety girls in Brighton over-do with all
their might. When Fijian cricketers were
“It,” the giddy creatures entertained the
brown ex-cannibals to the breaking point ( f
their pocket-allowance and of their credit
with Dad. The result of the pampering was
that one savage bolted with a girl in her own
motor-car ; she was rescued with much pub
licity and excitement and a blood-curdliiw
shriek. With characteristic impetuosity the
Brighton sisterhood has lately been adoring
Returned Wounded. Two khaki-clad men
came so much at home in one house that the
family eventually had to go away for a holi-
day to politely rid themselves of the visita-
tion. Now, it is discovered that their
strangers were living on cake and smiles
under false pretences. They had not even
enlisted.
Carina Butcher, a dashing and pretty girl
was married with the fashionable quietness
last week to Bert I.eibner at All Saints'
St. Kilda. The bride wore a dainty white
frock with an adorable white hat, but
changed into navy blue cloth to go honey-
mooning.
Margie, daughter of Alderman Jeffries, is
doing her bit in a way which other shop
keepers’ daughters might take as an ex-
ample. She has gone into papa’s boot store
as a “generally useful,” and releases one
man for service abroad. Mamma took her
for a fortnight to Queenscliff, and gave her
a royal fling of flapper pleasure before she
settled down to the routine of “Yes, sir ”
and “Yes, madame.” Who’s next?
In a Red Cross subscription list there
appeared this item: “£2 10s. from the
scholars at school, who walked two
miles to their annual picnic-place and saved
the cost of driving.” The brave little feet
of the youngsters are in sharp contrast to
the much-carried Parliamentary beetle-
crushers on their annual picnic—which, inci
dentally, happens monthly or thereabouts.
Yacht races have been the order of the
bay fronting St. Kilda and Brighton the last
couple of Saturdays, but from a social point
of view' the white-wings pastime is at a dead
end. The want of Gov’ment House interest
has damped the harbor-salts’ ardor, and the
war has done the rest. Gollin, owner
of the famous Sayonara, has gone to the
Front, and lots of the yachting boys who
have been to Gallipoli and back are too busv
patching up their he’alth to bother about
patching up the mainsail and caulking the
jibboom.
The Frank Walkers roped in £5O on
account of their moonlight garden-party at
Wombalano, liingwood. That took a “bit
of doing,” since Ringwood is far outside the
suburban radius. The paths of the garden
were made into lantern-lit streets and the
fruit-trees were full of Peter Pan fairy-
lights. Music and food were served with
moonlight effects.
Alf Brasch, w T ho has told some good
yarns in The Bulletin, has taken to khaki.
The Block sees him nowadays in a dashing,
officer’s uniform. He was always dashing,
and in the far-back days when Melbourne
danced no swaggah private hop was a com-
plete success without him.
Professor Masson has retired from the
presidency of the Professorial Board of Mel-
bourne University, and resigned his seat on
the Council. It is to be hoped his successor
will have a good deal less respect for Ger-
man kultur. Masson talked in the tone of
the learned professors of Cambridge Univer-
sity before the war, when they petitioned
the British Government to remain at peace
with Germany for her scientists’ sake. The
idea of German scientists being capable of
doing spy work for the Kaiser’s military
government had never suggested itself to
these trustful Cambridge brethren. They
couldn’t believe anything mean and murder-
ous of goggled professors who w T ore long hair
and studied the hereditary characteristics of
silk worms. Masson, seemingly, shares their
faith.
An old press-mate goes to a funeral: —
Melbourne loses a considerable, though far too
much dormant, literary force in A. M. Topp, so long
connected with the Argus. As journalist he began
with the Age, and I think he ought to have stuck
there. David Svme was generous to a fault in the
rope he allowed to talent, while the other shop is,
or was, too much addicted to trimming and pruning.
1 know. They sat on my arm and frightened m.v
afflatus, and I had to get out. Topp had a spell as
Age sub-editor, but, perhaps for more money, sub-
mitted to be squelched on the Argus, mostly with a
tinkering sub-sub-editorship. The Topp trio of
brothers were all clever little chaps. S. S. Topp,
barrister, was beautifully conceited, but I held him
ear-marked as .Judge. The survivor is C. A. Topp,
one of the most, eminent civil servants Victoria has
had. Yet A.M. was the best man of the three. He
was enrolled, under Principal Bromby, at the Church
of England Grammar School the day it opened; he
ran ahead of Hodges and Deakin. In the literan
way he helped H. G. Turner and Martin to estab-
lish the Melbourne Review. Topp was by long
odds the most philosophic-political writer, and had
correct views as to a review’s right leg. Then
Franklyn came along with his Victorian Review,
written for even by Moorhouse and Marcus Clarke,
and it was a case of Kilkenny cats eating each other.
Ned Stevens, the lengthy hope of Stevens,
of the Shakspeare Society, has stuck man-
fully to his fighting job. After severe i -
ness in Egypt he was discharged as medical!.'
unfit. This so annoyed him that he hoppe
off to his native Fog, and obtained a commis-
sion there. He was next wounded in France,
and later on stopped a bit of shrapnel l
the Dardanelles before being mentioned i
despatches. He is a versatile youth wn
could earn a crust as a writer, a black-an
white sketcher or a musical-hall artist.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

tive is called Brachinus jurinei in the stud book.
He, however, is a mere popgun in comparison with
the big Bornean species, which goes off like a
German machine-gun and fires ten or a dozen jets of
a fluid at you that turns to a greenish vapor, and
smells like a mixture of asafostida and rotten egg.
It’s a nice flavoring to get away from, but I found
the necessary nose-nerve to take some of the-fluid
and analyse it. I found in it hydrogen, sulphur, formic
acid (the venom of ants and bees) and a substance
which, had it not been organic, I should have taken
for the potently-corrosive nitric acid. At all events
a drop on the back of my hand made me feel as
if the Kaiser had bitten me.

“D.F.” : Bream fishing isn’t what it used
to be at most places, but at little Swanport (Tas.)
three fishermen accounted in three days’ fishing this
Christmas for/300, averaging 21b. each. All caught
with rod and’,line, of course; the local inhabitant
finds a dynamite plug save time and trouble.
“Montales”: About carpet-snake bite
(“Gurui,” B. 16/12/’15.) In Gippsland once I
was brought to see a boy supposed to be dying of
snake-venom. “Did you get the snake?” I asked,
as soon as I saw the bite. Yes; the corpse was by
the wood-heap. It was, as I expected, a carpet,
and the ease was a bad one of blood-poisoning; but,
after a hard fight, we pulled the youngster through.
Another time,, near Dandenong, my dog chased a
couple of gohannas that had scuttled out of the
interior of a long-defunct horse, collared one of them,
and got .snapped on the nose. Next morning his
head was as big as a football, and I had to put him
out of his misery with a charge of No., 6. Dirty
feeding, in both cases, no doubt; but, even with
clean teeth, a big “carp” or “go” can give a very
nasty bite.
* *
“Leo Lear”: Re “J.G.’s” par (B.
16/12/’l5) on difference between the black snake
and the more: deadly copperhead. You can’t go by
color alone to distinguish these two crawlers, as
the modesty of the copperhead makes him color up
to fit the landscape. In open grass land he
is a light brown; in scrubby country his hide
approaches the darkness of the tine black snake.
Only one diagnosis is infallible, and it is not advis-
able to practise it until the creeping thing is dead.
The copperhead has a single row of scales on his
under side from neck to tip of tail, while the black
poisoner has a single row as far as the vent, and
a double row thence to tail end. A third crawler
-—the brown snake —is also confused with both these.
He differs from the black sort in always being a
true brown color, and from the copp’erhead in having
a scale arrangement similar to the black bloke’s. I
live in a land of snakes, and would rather meet all
these thre.e. twisted into one knot than one tiger. The
tiger snake invariably attacks, is as quick as light,
and as venomous as the Kaiser. Moreover, he shows
a fancy for gardens, haystacks, etc., and has also
a habit of sitting on the top of bracken fern. A
tiger on the ground is bad enough, but when he
climbs up on things to get a better view of your
ear it is taking a mean advantage.
EQUAL DIVISION OF LABOR.
“I hear you and your son are carrying on the business together.”
“Well, not exactly. I’m doing the business and he’s doing the carrying on.”
A MERE PRELUDE.
WOWSER: "Oh, shocking! disgraceful ”
BINGHI: “Go on! That nothing to what this pheller can do!”
“Golly”: “Barcoo” in a recent issue says
that W. J. Young, one-time manager of Lansdowne,
Tambo (Q.), had the reputation amongst “gun”
sheep men of being the'fastest lamb-marker in Aus-
tralia in his day. Perhaps some of the old hands
will be able to say whether he could beat Brook-
man, once manager of Florida, Cobar way (N.S.W.),
and a persistent Bulletin Abo.-liar. He could keep
eight catchers busy. Poor chap, he was dried out
of the West, and put an end to his activities in
Sydney some years ago.
“Tiaki”: “Myall” (B. 9/12/’lo) wants to
know if any Abostralasian can beat his record of 851
in the fleece-picking competition. Yes, I can. I
picked fleeces at Blairlogie station (M.L.) over 26
years ago. There were nine men on the board and
not one did less than 150. Jack Renton was the
ringer with 222. Sam Smith came next to him, and
his hottest was in the vicinity of 220. Some of the
daily tallies struck an average of 175 to 180. I
received 25 boh a week. I wore moccasins as a rule
and sometimes pelt. My feet towards evening used
to feel like the soles of a spirit which had been
bastinadoed and compelled to run over the red-hot
roof of Sheol. “Myall’s” boy wasn’t fleece-picking;
he was at a Presbyterian picnic.
* * * *
“Barcoo”: “Alamon” wants the name
of the toughest “edible” fowl. I hand it
to him —the galah parrot at the end of a dry spell.
When the drought on the Flinders in 1903 broke
over our outfit, the deluge culminated in 18 inches
and we were marooned on a sandy spot for a fort-
night. First day we put six galahs in the pot to
stew at breakfast-time and they stayed there till
sundown. No good—we couldn’t tear the food
asunder. After boiling the granite for twelve more
hours one of the chaps managed to get a mouthful.
It was a good job some ducks arrived next morning.
* -* * .y,
“Oldburra” : I’ve been firing 20 years and
ought to know that when “Regius i.R. 25/11 /’l5)
says Bananaland beech is no good for fuel he is
wrong. Mixed with oak or stringy it is first class.
Of course, for raising steam jitta stands right out
on its own, with crowfoot elm second. But there
are others, and beech is among the runners.
* * * *
“Vigilans”: Re Mad Paddy (“Itan,” B.
23/12/’l5) in the Northern Territory. While cross-
ing the Barkly tableland from Powell’s Creek to
Camooweal I ran across Paddy at Connolly’s Lagoon.
This billabong is 30 miles from Brunette Downs, a
dry stage without a tree, hill or depression the
whole way. It was getting dark when I reached
the hole and a fire attracted me to the camp. Pat
was lying on a blanket eating damper and mutton-
chops while a fat gin gnawed a bone. “Have a
feed, mate!” said Paddy, pushing the tucker towards
me. When he found I was only a traveller he be-
came communicative. He reckoned the Barkly being
unfenced country was anyone’s land, and he lived
upon it, going from hole to hole, camping for months
in out-of-the way places with his gin. Any amount
of meat, he explained, and when he sold a prad or
two he filled up his packbags at Camooweal on the
Rankine, or at one of the stations. His game was
running in clean-skins, but if a branded one was
included—well, that was its fault. He had a big
mob of all sorts and kinds. For 20 years he had
lived on the tableland, never going further in than
Camooweal or Burketown, and to those places very
rarely. A big, bearded man, he told me that be-
fore going to that region he suffered horribly from
asthma, but since living tnere the complaint had
disappeared. He was good to bagmen but hated
squatters. He gave me a beautiful nag in place of
a half-blind mare I got at Renner Springs. I sold
it at Rockhampton for a tenner. They breed prime
sorts on the Barkly.
“F.K.P.”: At a very local sports meeting
in M.L. the ground was bounded on one side by a
pa and on another by the river. The nearest bar
was 25 miles away. A select party had gathered
around the cask on the bank amongst the manuka
when yells arose around the bend. Kelly, scouting
to see if danger threatened, was just in time to see
a diminutive brown object struggling in the water.
Shedding his coat, he hit the river with determina-
tion, and in a few minutes had a small native and a
big supply of water safely on the bank. The kiddie's
companions had rushed off for “te ole man,” and
as soon as that portly person came on the scene and
grasped the situation he solemnly shook Kelly’s
hand and dragged him along to the pa. There he
nearly knocked him out by pressing a tenner upon
him. Kelly was inclined to be modest, as becomes
a hero; but Ilenare was not to be denied, and
finally clinched matters by saying: “Pai gorrie, if
you never pull te piccaninny out te plurry liva
it cost me hundred and fifty quid for te tangi—
p’r’aps morel”
RECOLLECTIONS OF HARD TOIL.
JUDGE ( sharply ): “Tell me, did you ever
earn a shilling ?”
OTHER: “Yes, yer Honor —I voted for yer
once.”
“Mulga”: If “Yarrum” (B. 16/12/15)
resided in the brigalow and bclah areas that abound
between the Moonee and Condamine rivers' (Q ), h°
would evince no surprise at meeting death-adders
from two to three feet in length. It would be mad-
ness to travel at night without a light in these parts,
as they have a nasty habit of camping on the road
after dark. Before making the acquaintance of the
reptile I often heard that if touched on the back
with a stick it would jump to a height of six or
seven feet; but on investigating I found its acro-
batic abilities consisted of being very quick at
turning and striking, and that while it would not
bite anything poked at it, to pull the article away
without the adder getting home was impossible.
Bush philosophers consider the reason why death
follows so quickly on the snap of the adder is that
in inflicts a far deeper wound than other snakes.

A BILLET IN THE WEST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Four thousand feet above the smoke that hangs o’er
Sydney town
I vowed my roaming days should end —at last I’d
Settle down.
For he who seeks the golden drops that fall from
Fortune's cup
Has over-oft scarce gold enough to let him settle up.
From mine to mine, from field to field, ho more
my ways should trend,
But here a placid, peaceful life I’ll live until the
end;
And now, while reading farming works, with all a
learner’s zest,
There comes along an offer of a billet in the West.
The sunlit West, the Golden West, the West so far
away,
That splendid West where miners work in mines that
really pay ;
In mines that pay their exes, from the gold they win
below,
And divvy out a surplus to enrich a happy co. ;
Where still are shows a man may find, and work
upon his own,
And never fear a boss’s look, but win his way alone ;
Away with sordid farmlets now, they fail to interest
In face of such an offer as a billet in the West!
And must I leave the kids again, an income slow
but sure,
To chase again with new-born hope the olden,
golden lure ?
And must I pack my port and brave two thousand
miles of sea
And leave the winsome cabbage and the still more
winsome pea—-
The beetroot and the turnip and the other things
that look
A certain means to fortune when you raise them in
a book ?
’Tis hard to tear oneself away from toil so truly
blest,
But what about an offer of a billet in the West!
And yet I know I ought to judge with eye to future
good,
And study all the aspects as a business person
should ;
I must not hear the roaring stamps, nor see the gin-
wheels fly,
Nor mark the loaded buckets leap ore-laden towards
the sky;
sWith all the wisdom gleaned through years the pros
and cons must be ».-•
Dissected, assayed, analysed and balanced up by me.
And yet before my task begins, each knotty point to
test,
I’m betting very strongly on the billet in the West;
N.S.W.

My best friend —the
‘Pianola’ Piano”
NO man could have a better com-
panion. Many are the times
when I have reached home dog-tired,
my brain addled with thinking and my
nerves jumpy with worry. I hen I
have sat down at this good old
‘Pianola’ Piano of name and, as if by
magic, my troubles have vanished.
It may be because the ‘Pianola Piano enables me
to throw my mind wholly into the playing, it ma\
be just the influence of the music itself, but what-
ever be the reason I get np from that instiument
with my mind swept clean of the cobwebs of woiry
and anxiety—ready and fit for new tasks and
problems.”
So says many a business man who owns a Pianola
Piano. The “Pianola” Piano provides pleasure as
inexhaustible as the music it enables you to play
and provides distraction that every worker needs m
these days.

“Mulga”: If everybody's done I'll reply
to various remarks on speed-fencing. For “Pick’s”
particular information 1 would like to state that
while toiling for Billy Upton, who had the contract
for fencing and subdividing Tongy station, out from
Morven (Q.), a small job of nearly 500 miles, several
of the sinkers tallied 200 daily in mulga country.
For another instance of speedy work, I will quote
a three-mile horse-paddock fence erected by two
Coles brothers and mate on Wild Horse Plains. The
posts were cut, laid, put up and bored and the wire
ran and strained up in 22 days. The panels were
12ft.
* * * *
“Bareoo”: One of the natural sur-
prises of Central Queensland is a shallow well of
spring water on the railway midway between Barcal-
dine and Jericho. It resembles the blue-tinted
spring water of colder latitudes and with just the
same clear and sweet qualities; but it has this
peculiarity that it rises and falls with the tidal
movements. At high tide it almost comes to the
land surface; ordinarily the water level is 16ft to
20ft. down.
* * » •
“Gerald Barker”: Here’s a new pastime
for the Abo. school. For some time I was bothered
by a snake in my store-room, which has its share
of mice. The crawler had its abode under the house
where I couldn’t get at it. After much anxious
thought it struck me that there was no reason why
it shouldn’t be caught on a fish-hook. I got a hook,
attached some 16-gauge supple wire and passed the
wire through the body of a mouse. Then I attached
the line to a staple driven into the floor and went
to bed. Luck was in. I was awakened by the
scrape of the wire on the floor. When I entered
the store-room and the snake saw me and realised
that it couldn’t get away and that the more it tried
the worse pains it felt in its larynx, it just danced.
It contortioned right through the whole alphabet. It
hissed, threatened, stood on its head, then on its
tail, then on its middle, but the hook held fast.
Then I thought of what might happen if the hook
didn’t hold fast, and I hastily concluded the perform-
ance. But it was great while it lasted.
* * * *
“Tiger” : Please let me also say to “Bar-
coo” (B. 16/12/’l5) that he talks easy rubbish when
he calls the water-diviner of to-day a confidence
man. Perhaps some of him is, but I know a couple
who deliver the goods. One was regularly employed
by a boring co. when a hole was contracted for in
rocky country (it wasn’t round Windsor, either,
but out in Western N.S.W.). This man had to
locate a site from which the supply had to be at
least 500 gallons an hour. His expenses were
paid, but unless he “found” he got no cheque. Inci-
dentally, he never failed to collect. In one place
he pointed to the sinkers had to go through 20ft.
of solid rock; but underneath was the water. At
another place he had to find 1000 gals, an hour.
In this case he followed a stream for four miles
before directing where to bore. They got the supply
there, too, in rocky country. The other finder was
an old man doing the rounds who offered to locate
water for a fiver. A station-owner told me the old
cove came along one night and made him the bid.
He reckoned there was no water in the place, as
they had tried, in a hollow, with a 40ft. shaft.
This was boarded over and looked like a disused
well. He took the old chap over and said “Now,
NO SATISFYING THE SEX.
THE LIDY: " Don't you dare come here —
why don't yer go to the Front?"
THE TRAMP: "Lidy, the last time yer TOLD.
me to come round to ther back.”
then, if you’re no fake, let me see the stick work.”
The old boy walked around for a quarter of an
hour, but never a bend from the stick. “Strangel”
he muttered, “that’s the first time I’ve failed.” He
then went to a knoll about 100 yards from
the well. “Water here,” he said. All he got
was some tucker and a bunk. Twelve months later
when the tanks gave out the boss remembered and
set to work on the knoll. He got splendid water at
18ft. and if the old chap comes along again there’s
a cheque for him to collect.
COMPARISONS.
BILL (after reading of German atrocities): “Yer know, Joe, the missus ain't so had,
when yer come ter think of it."
“Pick”; After a bush fire had ramnaged
through the Araluen Valley (N.S.W.) recently many
big gum logs were left ablaze, and to lessen the
chance of these starting Sheol going again
with every change of the breeze, weary fire-
fighters with buckets humped water from the river
to quench the live embers. But each time they
returned with the water they found that the timber
had lit up again in their absence. Then two
swaggies came along and explained how the thing
ought to be done. Instead of squelching a small
location of the fire with full buckets of water, they
immersed bunchy bushes in the liquid and with
these gradually sprinkled out the danger. All hands
voted it a bush trick worth entering on the records.
* * * *
Dicey Iron”; The snake mentioned by
Barcoo ’ (B. 4/11/’ls) has dark bands down both
sides on his ribs. He is the N.Q. tiger, and no
snake hereabout disputes his title. Don’t know if
he would kill a man or his dog if he bit one. As
a rule, if he tries to bite anything, anything retreats
in disorder. He is not full grown at from five to
nine feet. Buckle five and nine together, and you
lery neai ly .get him. Killed one on the Andromache
between Bowen and Mackay. Did not have a tape
in my saddle pouch, but I left a lump of hide on
the back of his neck and about three inches on the
small end, and the bit I took home measured 14 ft.
6in. long and Bin. across where he’s widest when
pegged out. Once got a 13-footer near Glenlinedale.
He looked Pickwickian about the middle, and when
I investigated the cause the bulge was due to a 3ft.
gohanna all in one piece. I found a newly-shed skiii
on the Emuford side once. It was 14ft. long and
damp and clammy, but I could not track its late
owner.
* * * *
“Dustee”: A man betrays himself by the
way he lights matches. If he strikes fire on the seat
of his pants put him down as careless, jovial, talka-
tive and somewhat unthrifty; if he does the deed in
front he is slovenly. Beware of him who runs
his match round the box before he strikes; he is a
schemer, an underground engineer unable to play
straight. Scratching to and fro before ignition be-
trays the nagger, the irritator, one who will never
let the subject drop. Unstripping fibre from wax
to wrap round head shows a man whom distress has
taught economy; he takes no chances; frequentlv
a great traveller like Weary Willie or Professor
David. He who stands on one leg and scratches
his match on the sole of his free boot possesses much
ballast but little money; he stands at street corners,
puts straw on his head, and plays football and
cricket loudly with his mouth on week nights and
Sunday afternoons. The carrier of matches loose in
his pockets is a roysterer, a bird of midnight, one
who wants a match handy in any circumstances. A
match struck on the pipe bowl points to carelessness
of appearances, an unssthetic disposition, a tendency
to uncleanly habits; along the stem it sometimes
denotes a finicky soul, at all times a sober one.
\ ulgar show makes itself known in striking on the
edge of a coin, the vulgarity varying according to
whether the coin is copper, silver or gold. Who
lights his pipe with a burning glass in sunny
weather is an economic crank, generally with knobs
on his forehead and a passion for theological debate.
A firm stroke across the box points at once to
strength of character and straightforwardness. If
the match is directed away from striker he is gen-
erous ; if towards him, he is careful. Should the
match, however, be borrowed in this latter case
the borrower is pretty sure to be mean and stingy’
The youth who lights his match along his front
teeth is an ass.

‘F.H.R.” : Monaro people knew Mick
Casey’s black horse as well as they knew Mick as
he was a regular performer at the shows. Mick was
returning from shearing when one night Darkv
broke the hobbles, jumped the gate an/ gotaway
in he WaS Wini,ing the hi Sh jump
in Sydney. Mick borrowed a horse and made back to
ass, where he thought the old horse was bred, but
that h rT V f hIS W f S there ; and ’ further . Mick found
that Darky wasn t Yass-bred at all. Mick’s lo=s
to Me/h” t 0 th \ d ° gS ’ and he fol l°wed the hounds
to Melbourne where one day I met him. A ques-
tion about the old horse brought tears to his eves
and over a few beers he told me the storv. After
that we went strolling by the Yarra where the
mTw T v Unl ° adirig> and our attention was drawn

ouble to escoit down a gangway. It looked like

, *“• . , over we lushed, and the mate told us
they had picked him up about 10 miles this side of
1 assy, swimming like a fish. Barring a couple of
joints off his tail, Darky was none the worse- in
fact, the shark that swallowed that hairv morsel
must have felt much more off-color than he'did We
found out afterwards that Darky was Tasmanian
bred. He was just quietly making for home.
“5.&.”: At Denny’s Well, Gippsland,
during the Christmas holidays a walking party
came upon a man in a hole. The tourists were made
aware of the man’s presence by the sudden appear-
ance of his head above ground near where they were
camped. On investigating they found him lying
at the bottom of a neat little 6x2 shaft about
sft. deep. When the party sought to allay its
curiosity the man in the hole explained that he
had dug the grave himself, and that he was waiting
for someone to “fill him in.” The pedestrians
tried to argue him out of his hole, but he refused
to budge, and when they left he was still waiting
for someone to “fill him in.” The police were informed
at the nearest civilised centre, 13 miles away, and
the mounted constable, accompanied by one of the
pilgrims, returned to the spot with all speed. They
found the hole filled in, and having emptied it with
feverish haste came upon a sheet of paper with the
words: “Wishing you a Happy New Year” I The
bush develops its own quaint ideas of humor.
THESE DECADENT AUSTRALIANS.
“So poor old Bill's gone, has he? Wot
knocked 'im out?”
“Three tons of cement fell on his chest.”
“Poor old Bill! He always was weak there.”
“Little ’Ook”: “Doubter” (B. 9/12/’l5)
inquires whether Condy’s crystals are a sure cure for
snakebite. I tried them once, after being chewed
by one of the black sort, and am still alive. I
made two incisions with a knife, mixed the crystals
into a paste in the palm of my hand with the aid of
a little saliva, and rubbed it well in. The treat-
ment hurts, but is to be preferred to removing sec-
tions of your anatomy with a butcher’s cleaver.
THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Twas New Year’s sve. The night was warm
And heavy like a blanket Buit;
The sky was laboring with a storm
That wouldn’t break, and man and brute
Lay panting in the fat, hot air.
True comfort was not anywhere.
’Twas at this time that William Brown
Keminded Just of oaths they’d sworn
That when the Old Year’s light went down
The two for one long year would scorn
The lure of alcohol, and be
Bond brothers in sobriety.
They had their final beer (man’s size).
“No more,” said Brown with rigid face
“Except, of course, there should arise
Some extraordinary case.”
“We must abstain, unless, perchance, .
A very special circumstance
“Occasion give.” ’Twas Just who spake.
“You never know your luck. A chap
Might drown himself, or bite a snake,
Or meet some similar mishap
Would make refusal of a gin—
Well, something like a special sin.”
They gripped, and swore the oath again.
Outside, the air, as I have said,
Was like a motor-coat. The men
Looked on the long, dry year with dread;
They walked and talked —they couldn’t sit
And often William tried to spit.
They watched a pub their minds to keep
From thoughts of drink. Then homeward both
They went. Brown felt that he could weep,
And Just to go was very loath.
Alas! the bad can be so glad,
The good so pitifully sad 1
How dry they were! That man is dust
Seemed quite established to the twain.
Then in a wayside gutter Just
Came on a parcel. In his brain
Fond recollections seemed to flit,
And swiftly he went down to it.
It held two bottles full of rum.
Just looked at Brown and sighed, the wight.
“Did e’er such grim misfortune come
To weak men striving for the right ?....
Have you a corkscrew, Bill, by chance?
Here is a ‘special circumstance’ 1”

Five-seater Touring' Car, £325
Sing'le-seater Car, £315
A Masterpiece by the Worlds
Biggest Builders of Big Cars.
This new model is the best four-cylinder
car we ever built.
But because of enormously increased
production it is sold at the lowest price we
ever made.
It has Beauty —a long, low streamline
body and beautifully curved cowl.
It has Comfort —real riding comfort
deep, inviting upholstery and extra long
underslung rear springs.
It has Conveniences control is easy and
natural electric switches for magneto,
lights and signal are right at hand, con-
veniently arranged on the steering column.
It has Magneto Ignition certain and
o o

It has an easy operating clutch a young*
girl can operate it with ease.
In no other motor-car at anywhere near
j
its price can you get even a majority of
these Overland advantages.
And this is as it should he, for no other
producer has ever built so many big motor-
cars.
Therefore no other producer has ever
had such vast buying power, or so great an
opportunity to perfect specialised manu-
facturing methods to effect such economy

“The Tame Scientist”: “Tonto” (B.
G/l/’l(i) wants to know if the luminous
dials of watches contain any radium. How
many, hundred pounds did “Tonto” give for
his chronometer that he should fancy the
precious stuff was being wasted like that?
The name radium is used by heftiest Private
Enterprise in its description of the dial,
but there is not a trace of it used. Calcium
sulphide, incorporated in an ordinary paint,
will absorb light-energy when exposed to
sunlight, and give out a feeble glow for
several hours after the strong light has been
removed ; but, owing to the necessity of ex-
posing the paint to sunlight, it would not
be very suitable for the dials of watches
fitted with leather or metal covers. A better
and much more expensive preparation is an
emulsion of barium platinocyanide in gela-
tine. This is the material used in X-ray
screens, and has the power of absorbing
any invisible (scientifically called actinic)
lays, and giving them out again as light.
As these actinic rays career through the
air at all times and in all directions, there
are enough of them to cause the spots of
emulsion to glow at any time. Radium gives
out rays which are mainly actinic ; it gives
out no light rays at all. and would there-
fore fail absolutely as a dial illuminator.
“Tonto” needn’t worry about danger.
If his luminous watch causes him to miss
his morning train it’s about the worst it
can do.
Captain J. PI. South clears up the history
of the Edina :
She was built by Barclay and Guide, launched at
Port Glasgow and came to Australia in 1863 for
Jaimes Ilenty, of Portland, Victoria. Her first trip
out of an Australian port was to Maoriland carrying
300 diggers, Captain Rolls in charge. Afterwards
-lie traded to Warrnambool and Portland until
Howard Smith bought her in 1875 and placed me in
command. The first voyage under the new flag was
to Brisbane and Maryborough in July of that year.
At that time the A.S.N. Co. had a fine service of
steamers on the Queensland coast, and controlled the
whole of the trade. On the Edina’s first trip to
Brisbane we could scrape up only 20 tons of cargo,
but we brought back to Sydney from Maryborough
35,000 ft. of pine. That gave us a look-in. The old
hooker now plies between Melbourne and Geelong
under the command of Captain Forbes, who has had
charge since 1880.
«■ * * *
“Hori”: Talking about old hookers, the
Governor Wynyard, built in 1851, at Auck-
land, by Robert Stone, remains a cheering
memory with water-front ancients. She
was the first steamer to swim in Maoriland
waters, and was built of wood, with side-
paddles and a “steeple-top” engine. Her
boiler was made by a handy person named
Brown, who blew into Auckland on an
American barque at the very moment when
the local blacksmiths had despaired of being
able to bend the boiler plates to the right
curve. The Governor Wynyard was tried
on the Tamaki River, with the useful Brown
in the engine-room. A young Maori who
counted himself a swimmer dived into the
river and challenged the steamer to a speed
contest. He got a flying start, but the
“Ruffing Pig,” as the vessel was nicknamed,
wasn’t as slow as she was noisy. It was
her habit of blowing the exhaust into the
paddle-boxes that caused her to roar and
bellow as she did. After carrying butter
and eggs on the Tamaki for a time, the
“Puffing Pig” was chartered in connection
with a wild-cat mine said to exist on the
Hen and Chickens. After that she ploughed
the waters of the Thames, carrying stores
to Coromandel. Then, with paddle-boxes
removed, she was sailed across to Melbourne
by Chan fry Harris, sailor and journalist.
There in the boom times, with steam up
once more, she often earned £BO a day on the
Yarra. A perilous trip across the Straits
took her to Tasmania, where she traded on
the Tamar River, and it is just possible that
the tough old craft is waddling along some-
where still, with Brown’s boiler patched
with kerosene tins and her ancient roar
turned to a centenarian’s wheeze.
“Two Seas” : Most fruit-growers have had
similar experiences to “Worried” (B.
23/12/T5). But some have profited, and
have combined to do their own selling. The
enclosed account sales illustrate the advan-
tages of organisation that “Worried” and
other small growers of the grumble-but-do-
nothing order are continually lamenting does
not exist. The writer picked and packed 23
cases of pears one day, and sent 10 cases
to the Fruit-growers’ Co-operative Co. (Syd-
ney), and the balance to an ordinary agent.
The Co-op.’s returns show eight cases sold at
Bs. and two at 7s. Od. —total £3 19s.
Charges: Freight, ss. Id.; commission ss.
lid. and cartage lOd. P. Enterprise, who
received 13 cases on the same day, thought-
fully prepared the sender for the impending
shock by wiring: “Your pears arrived in
an absolutely rotten condition.” The account
sales started off with “Two cases at 4s. 6d.,”
which for “absolutely rotten ’ pears is a
fair price, and seems to indicate that there
is a demand in Sydney for decay. But,
apparently, the demand is limited, as the
balance of the consignment tapered off to 2s.
Ac that point, .10 cases having been dis-
posed of for £1 Os. (id., P. Enterprise passed
out the remaining three with a brief entry of
“thrown away.” Then he got to work upon
that £1 9s. 6d. Freight reduced it by
ss. 6d., cartage bit off Is. Bd. (the standard
rate is Id. per case), and “commish” snipped
off 7s. 6d. Observe the difference : The Co-
op.’s commish is ss. lid. on £3 19s. (id. ; the
private pirate rakes 7s. 6d. from £1 9s. Od.
Thus, quite part from the startling differ-
ence in the prices returned for exactly simi-
lar fruit, picked, packed and railed on the
same date, the prices obtained by piracy are
still further reduced by commission and
charges. By the way. this agent still posts
the grower urgent circulars advising him
to rush along his fruit and “share in the
excellent prices ruling.”
* «• * *
“W.A.R.” : Met it the other day. Pushed
through a street crowd, and found a spruce
young man working a winch attached to a
tilted cart. The other end of the rope was
attached to a dead horse; and the cheerful
winch-man was rapidly pulling that carcase
up the inclined plane of his vehicle, coming
round to the rear occasionally to push the
patient dead-moke’s legs into place. Painted
on the cart in bright red letters was the
boss’s profession: “Dead Horses and Cattle
Removed.” The new paint, the spruceness of
man and vehicle, and the.cheerful smile on
the face-of the owner showed that trade was
flourishing. Evidently the war has not
affected one of our great natural industries.
•* * * *
“Pick” : Whether those banks that issued
the notes referred to by “Quidam” (B.
9/12/’l5) as stolen and hidden in a lime-
stone cave by long-ago bushrangers have
gone bung or not wouldn’t matter as far as
the worth of the paper is concerned. While
renewing the R.C. chapel fence at Jugiong
(N.S.W.) in 1895 my mate and I bottomed
on a pickle-bottle crammed with bank notes.
It was parching weather, and the pub was
near, so we decided to refresh the town.
But the thirst had to remain undiluted, for
the notes crumbled to powder as we care-
fully tried to hook them out with a bit of
wire. They were no more exchangeable for
beer than the ordinary dust of the post-hole.
* * * *
“Die Mihi” : Instead of borrowing money
at 5 per cent, interest till the end of eter-
nity, why should not the Commonwealth
employ one of the oldest methods of public
finance—the lottery? Every civilised coun-
try in its early stages of growth has used
lotteries instead of taxes to raise money for
public defence. Many nations have legalised
and to-day employ the lottery as a legitimate
substitute for taxation. The earliest-known
invention was the mariner’s compass (2634
b.c. ) ; the next arrived when old Pala-
medes produced dice in 1244 b.c., and man-
kind has been gambling industriously ever
since. They had sweeps in ancient Athens
and Rome and Venice as they have in mod-
ern Buenos Ayres and Santiago and Rio
Janeiro to-day under Government control and
for the behoof of the community. And why
not? A lottery hurts nobody, and may
benefit many. The bulk of the monev re-
ceived for the tickets would go to the State,
free of interest, free of costly administra-
tion ; it would be cheaply collected and not
missed by the subscribers. It is a simple
and quick means of raising cash without
pawning anything or harming anybody.
Mankind, and especially womankind, loves
a flutter, and a State lottery with a first
prize of £lOO.OOO would bring about a deluge
of ready cash to pay for soldiers and shells
and ambulances. Above all. this war has
changed ideas and ethics, and what may have
been wrong in a Tattersall sweep is nowa-
days perfectly right in a State lottery.
* # * *
Don’t write—send!” was the advice
given by Wellington—or was it Bill Adams
Bonaparte? Nowadays, with the tele-
phone rate up to tdppence while penny
postage is universal, the truly economical
citizen’s rule is “Don’t ’phone—write !” So.
if a reply is needed, your friend (or enemy
as the case may be) has to come along with
half the cost of the conversation.
* * * *
“Ci-git”: In Noumea three things are
badly needed —another bank, another ship-
ping line and cheap beer. The Bank of
India and China, a French concern with
total assets of about £250,000, monopolises
the banking business most successfully. I
was paid in Melbourne a premium of 8 per
cent, for the money I took into Noumea,
and was charged 12J per cent, discount
for a cheque on Sydney to take away the
money I had not spent. Fancy a charge of
£l2 10s. for a draft on Sydney for £100!
It would have been just as safe and a lot
cheaper to have worn the sovs. in a canvas
belt round my stomach. The Messageries
Maritimes Co. charges £l5 2s. 6d. return for
a trip of 1040 miles, and if it is not ashamed
I am. No wonder people do not visit New
Caledonia more as tourists. All beer is 2s.
per . pint bottle, whether French or Aus-
tralian. A company merely to sell money,
passages and beer would pay well.
BANANA-FRENZY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
For twenty-nine days of the calendar leaf
I avoid the piled fruit on the platter ;
Bananas seem things that bring nothing but grief,
And ripe apples and peaches don’t matter.
“1 thought you liked fruit?” says my hostess to me,
And I cannot deny that I love it;
But all my excuses seem fiddle-de-dee
While my stomach somehow seems above it.
On the thirtieth day of the month I’m aware
That my life lacks its loveliest pleasure
If Queensland bananas aren’t piled here and there,
And every fruit-sausage I treasure.
1 take a ripe dozen done up in a bag
And I sit by the ocean, my dearie,
And peel like a Trojan and chew like a hag.
Hooray for bananas done up in a bag,
For breakers that rage and for breezes that nag
And the jaws that chew on till they’re weary!

REVOLUTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is nothing revolutionary in the progressive
sense about anything that the Postal Department does.
—Daily paper.
Red revolution from these quiet places
Stays distant far, with fear-averted eyes ;
The gross-fat spider through the slumber chases
The droning, superannuated flies;
The letters flutter in with gentle motion,
They stay or go as chance and luck dictate;
And, undisturbed as some large, stagnant ocean,
The piled complaints for explanation wait.
Xo revolution. Day and night’s procession
Of inward mails and outward makes its way
Through tangles of large sloth still'in possession,
Despite all prayers an anguished public pray.
Can make them move at all? Don’t worry 1
Their strenuous idleness will ne’er relax
Till desperate in a hurry
Runs to the woodheap and brings in the axe.

SOMETHING ABOUT SUB-EDITORS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Less than anything in the world do 1
want to be a sub-editor —to go to the chair.
It sounds like electrocution.
Yet on the editorial side the sub-editor
is the Necessary Man of a daily paper. Any
newspaper can do without editors, leader-
writers, special-writers, poets _ and funny
men. Some large newspapers in Australia
have tried the experiment of doing without
reporters, following the lead of the man
who reduced his donkey’s hay by one Straw
per diem.
The sub-editor (considered as a man or
as a department) is the Digestive Apparatus
on the news side. If news were fired into
the paper without undergoing the sub-edi-
torial processes, that newspaper would be
in the same state of health as a man fed
by subcutaneous injections of roast beef,
sausages and potatoes.
Nobody loves sub-editors with a true and
abiding love. They are too moody. They
are like the vast and briny sea; at one
moment smiling in gentle beauty, at the
next lashed into r-r-rage by the tempest.
Yet consider their provocation.
Every importunate bore who haunts the
office, to be resolutely refused an interview
with the* editor, is unloaded on the sub-
editor. When he arrives the sub probably
has 21 bales of copy on his desk, while the
editor’ (if the truth were known) is dis-
cussing Jamie Braid’s driving style or
MeGoorty’s claims to the middleweight
championship. All the same, it is the sub-
editor who has to talk the bore out of the
office.
When the printer is clamoring at his
loudest, and the copy is . snowing at its
fastest, the sub discovers in your copy (or
mine) a hiatus between slip 3 and slip 5.
lie has to hunt for slip 4. Of course he
doesn’t find it. We wrote the copy last
night, and slip 4 is reposing in your locked
desk (or mine) along with the banana-skin,
the cup with the coffee-dregs, and the cre-
mated cigarette-butt which has burned a
symmetrical scar in the varnish.
Sub-editing is unhealthy. The wonder is
that it doesn’t lead to miner’s complaint.
Minute particles of paper and inconceivable
germs mount with every inhalation into the
sub’s lungs. Calculations on the subject
have been made by a foreign professor,
whose name I do not know how to spell.
It contains four j’s, three q’s, and several
examples of the letter-collocations tszeli and
ngny. Professor Tszchngnyjjjjqqqetcetera
estimates the number of germs per hour at
a figure which also I have forgotten, though
I recollect that it contains the ciphers
000000000.
Do not, therefore, consider yourself
aggrieved when a sub-editor speaks hotly to
you.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein elsewhere contained, sub-editors need
somebody to talk to them. Between succes-
sive avalanches of copy they must not be
allowed to sink into mental torpor. They
are like big machines, which must be kept
running gently that their movement may be
“sweet” ; or like furnaces, which cannot be
allowed to grow cold. A conversationalist,
in the intervals of work, keeps their minds
awake. But care must be taken to select a
good-tempered, thick-skinned man as the
conversationalist. Which, by the way, is a
hideous word, and ought to be blacklisted.
Sub-editors, when they die, as they gener-
ally do, always go to Heaven, as they
deserve to do. They’ve had their thousand
years of torment.
Sub-editors never have large families.
They are 'too strongly confirmed in the
blue-pencil habit.

A new opening for the “personal” advt.
In the Adelaide dailies (6/1/T5) a sensi-
tive person “wishes to notify his many
friends of Booleroo Centre that on January
3 he presented himself for enlistment in the
Australian Imperial Force, but was rejected
as medically unfit.”

Wairarapa in Maoriland’s House of Reps.,

Hornsby, who had toiled in the business with
father, recently climbed into the mayoral
collar at Carterton, and did so well in his
first year that the people made him take a

From Fleet-street:—
London Times has scored 41,000 numbers, and
rejoices retrospectively on having come out every
day for 130 years, barring Sundays and a few
Christmases. Until recently the Times, alone among
the London dailies, insisted on appearing as usual
on Christmas morning, alleging imperative obliga-
tions to its subscribers and advertisers. But all
difficulties in that respect were gradually overcome,
and the Times now has a day .off the same
as its London contemporaries. The last time
it had an anniversary splash an eminent German
professor translated the whole number into his
language and published it in book form with explan-
atory notes and comments of his own. The editor
doubts -whether this compliment will be repeated
under existing circumstances. The Times, by the
way, started as the Daily Universal Register, and
ran for three years under that title, but it does not
count that thousand or so in numbering its issues.

“Nemo”; The meeting held in Melbourne
to get up a memorial to the late Joe Winter,
of the Irish and Catholic Advocate, was a
pretty.cold affair. There was only one priest
in the little crowd—from Winter’s own
parish of Hawthorn. Two of his old col-
leagues in the Irish fighting days, Dr. O’Don-
nell and M. P. dangers, were the promoters.
Of course they were there. And a few old
press hands, such as Ben Hoare, whose
leaders would stretch across Bass’s Strait,
and Grattan Grey, who has written “Travels
Round the Globe,” and miles of other things.
The meeting wanted a scholarship at the
proposed R.C. College attached to Melbourne
University. “We shall want £OOO or £700.”
said the chairman. “£1000,” said Ben Hoare.
But the biggest subscription was a couple of
guineas.

Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by

Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-

Cyclist broke the World’s Road Record for 24 hours by 79 miles
using only
Plume Benzine
and

In covering the miles, the pistons of Baker s engine rubbed the cylinder walls
9,683,877 times, with only Gargoyle Mobiloil “B” between. Baker says that his motor
finished in perfect condition and that "Plume n and Gargoyle Mobiloil “B” are the best ever.

“F.N.”: Wowsers, awake! On a recent
Sabbath the volunteer motor-corps which
works in Melbourne on behalf of the Red
Cross, arranged to run a party of returnod-
wounded from the base hospital to Frank-
ston-on the-sea. The local Wattle Club, a
little concern formed some time ago to hand
around sandwiches and a slice of chicken to
visiting soldiers, asked the committee of the
mechanics’ institute for permission to use
the hall. The committee, in its best wowser
manner, mumbled something unintelligible
about “desecrating the Sabbath.” and refused
to lend the building for such immoral pur-
poses; so the party had to take its sand-
wiches in the sand. What sort of animal is
this Franks ton wowser that, remembering
the Sabbath day to keep it holy, he forgets
Gaba Tepe?
Poor Sam Smith is dead at last. He first
came into prominence during the big mari-
time strike, and was for years secretary of
the Seamen’s Union. In the N.S.W. Assem-
bly he sat for a while for Pyrmont, in succes-
sion to Tom Davis, and then his hard head
and unimpeachable straightness won for him
the appointment of workers’ representative
on the first N.S.W. Arbitration Court, with
Mr. Cruickshank as employers’ representa-
tive and Justice Cohen as chairman. The
work was most strenuous, and there is no
doubt whatever that it helped to kill all
three. Poor Sam Smith outlived the others ;
but his last years were clouded by terrible
afflictions of mind and body.
“Nubar Pasha”: The striking picture,
“Great Britain in Egypt: 1856,” in the
National Art Gallery at Sydney deserves a
companion, “Australians in Egypt: 1916.”
The scene at the dingy Arab wineshop is,
save for the khaki in place of the tartan of
the Ilielander and the very bright uniform
of the Redcoat, no different from what pre-
sents itself nov\ r in Cairo. At the door there
are the same ricketty wooden benches, and
on them the same indolent-looking Arabs,
smoking or looking vacantly out on to the
haret, where stands the much-wrought don-
key with his beaded neck and decorated body
and legs. The Coptic girl that Horsley
shows bringing drinks to the Highlander and
the Redcoats is still there; the same blue
skirts enfold the well-made form of the son
of Mohammed the ten-thousandth, and he
wears to-day the same half-intelligent but
really cunning look he cast at the uniformed
drinkers of ’B6. But the central figures of a
realistic; reproduction of the scene now daily
presented at the small saloons in Cairo would
be those of Gallipoli Bill and four or five
oi his khakied Australian pals waiting for
Pyramids beer. The subject is peculiarly
appropriate for treatment by an Australian
brush. Whose shall it be?
The other day Melbourne Age felt
tempted to ask by what means Australia intends
to stimulate her production, safeguard and develop
her industries and settle and defend her vast empty
spaces.
Wh .y, what is the matter with the present

Now that the cerebrospinal meningitis
epidemic is succumbing to the influence of
summer weather it seems permissible to
allude to the ghastly humor of the medical
authorities w r ho dealt so casually with the
disease. At a meeting of the Victorian branch
* n oc t°ber last “the opinion was
eld by nearly all present that the dis-
ease was only mildly infective in the menin-
geal stage, and that it did not possess the
ruient infectivity generally attributed to
, Dy the public.” In the same newspaper
. u ? n 111 which this learned medical
' mon was published there appeared the
k'vn° , l ncei^r I } t that three members of a
v l!L e } oa (Vic.) family—the mother and two

“Well Tmnne argument usually begins with:

out that another man has got Bung set. War is a
ruinous and bloodthirsty method of persuading men
to use their brains, but the fact is sure that war has
caused many hardworking citizens to think, and the
noiel mental process is resulting in the conclusion
that a man who works hard all the week, retains
little more than can keep himself and family on
decenUy and presents the balance to the safe-keeping
of a publican, is an ass. And when a mob of men
begin to tally up how many mates they have seen
go under while Bung has got fatter, the result isn’t
going to benefit the Trade; and the Trade had better
make arrangements accordingly. Judgino- by the
consensus of opinion at such debates, it would seem
that if some reformer would come out with a com-
prehensive scheme for nationalising the drink traffic,
not only in the retailing of the commodity but in
the manufacture, with provision for very consider-
ably reducing the alcoholic contents of beer, he
would speedily acquire a large following. Anyway,
I m convinced of this, from keeping my mouth shut
and my ears open, that if the trade isn’t mended it
is going to be ended.
“The Old Soldier” : This howl about con-
scription being un-English makes me
fatigued. The Militia Ballot Act, which
was passed early in the French Revolu-
tionary war, when Britain seemed to be
pretty nearly on its last legs, gave Lords-
Lieutenants of counties, if the recruits for
their militia regiments did not enlist fast
enough, power to summon the available
young men and make them draw lots till
the ranks were full, with something over.
All the militia regiments were kept per-
manently embodied for garrison duty and
were regarded as permanent recruiting
depots for the regular army.
Dr. Truby King, who has done so much
towards saving babies and lunatics in Maori-
land and elsewhere, and who is always
urging more sanitary methods in the milk-
producing business, has gone into the cow
industry himself. At Wharuarimu, in
southern M.L., he has had a shed erected
that is one of the wonders of the milking
world. The tanks and the floors of the shed
and yards attached are all concrete and are
hosed down daily. A convenient stream has
been harnessed up to drive the six-stand
milking plant, but a supply of steam is also
ou hand as an auxiliary. The 12 stalls are
steam heated so that Strawberry may feel
comfortable in the winter, and there won’t
bo any suggestion of Antarctica about them.
The whole place is electrically lighted ; and
the color of the hangings in the drawing-
room where the cows are to entertain their
friends at afternoon tea is under consider-
ation.
“Moana”:, It’s a long time since any real
improvement was made in the telephone, but
a device has come along which can be fixed
to any instrument and which so magnifies
the sound that a dozen people in a room
can listen to a message coming from the
machine. But the chief alleged use for the
device, which is really a loud-speaking horn,
is that when you are asked to “hold the
wire” while the person at the other end goes
away to look up something, you don’t have
to waste time, but simply clip on the
receiver and go ahead with your work.
When the person who has been looking up
things returns and howls for you his voice
can be heard raging through the room.
Whereupon you smash the whole telephone
connection and never have to worry about
it any more.
NO SURPRISE.

The announcement that New South Wales was again
in the money market for £2,000,000 was not unex-
pected— Press item.
N’ot unexpectedly we hear the tinkle
Of coin extracted from the pawnshop till,
The crisp notes that in eager fingers crinkle
Where Cohen still has idle wealth to spill.
We knew it must be so. We saw them weighing
The baby’s portion on the household scales.
Who holds the ticket? Rumor answered saying:
“Been drinking hard. Her name is New South
Wales.
“War or no war, she has a head upon her.
Her morning thirst she must make haste to quench.
Although she goes the pace, upon my honor,
At times she seems a very taking wench.
“Wedded to Holman. That explains the matter.
No wonder he must come to Cohen’s shop
Tc get the silver for the annual scatter
That keeps reform at bay and him on top.
Not unexpected. No. He deftly hedges
The platform of his party urging thrift;
And disregarding prayers and oaths and pledges,
Me strips the future naked to her shift,
“We cannot be surprised. We always knew it.
Deftly he lifts the fringe of Israel’s tent.
Statecraft with him means g'et a cheque and blew it
With oratorical accompaniment.”

Moonrise on the Australian Coast.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Athwart the primal portals of the night
Where sleep and silence brood, one writhen
tree
Leans, where the long land crumbles to the
sea
That stains the salt, still, glimmering sand
with white,
Muttering and mumbling its unsated spite;
Deep-throated thunders that eternally
Break in fierce foam, or haunt unrestingly
Wind-wasted echoing uplands, starry-light.
Slowly the circle of the monstrous moon
Rises as from a bath of crimson fire
Beyond the eastern ridge, mysteriously
Painted with man a pale and cloudy rune;
Somewhere a curlew wails a wild desire
That shudders to the vast and sail-less sea.

A DIFFERENT CHILD
AFTER LARGE STOMACH WORM
WAS EXPELLED BY ONE DOSE OF
COMSTOCK’S “DEAD SHOT” WORM
PELLETS.
“My little boy, aged two years, suffered
from worms for some months,” writes Mr.
F. W. Lloyd. 21 Clark Street, East Bruns-
wick, Vic. “We bad
given him different
kinds of worm
powders and tab-
lets, but without
any results. See-
ing your advertise-
ment we thought
we would gi''fj
them a trial, and
the result was
wonderful. After
the first dose the
child passed a
worm nine inches
long, and as thick
as a penholder.
You may use this
as you think best. I have preserved the
worms to show any person what your tablets
have done.”

POLITICAL
POINTS
NOT TAKING
ANY RISKS.
During the recent Christ-
mas holidays Premier Peacock
got mixed up in a prizefight
at Lexton. He was even
asked to hold the stakes. Two
or three friends called out,
“Go on, S’ralec, hold the
money!” One of the princi-
pals who had made the re-
quest immediately apologised,
intimating that he had not
known the gentleman was the Premier. —News item.
BOXER: "Ho ! In that case you might as
well ’and the money hack.”
The Victorian Labor movement still con-
tinues to kick itself in the eye. In defiance
of the central executive of the Political
Labor Council, the other night the Haw-
thorn branch passed a resolution endorsing
the recent action of the Trades Hall Coun-
cil, which foolish body called on unionists
to ignore the new recruiting cards issued in
the name of a Labor Prime Minister by
authority of a Labor Government.
Maoriland bank returns to December 31
show, apart from Government transactions,
an excess of deposits over advances amount-
ing to £6,112,462. Compared with the posi-
tion at the end of 1914 the people with hank
accounts in the Dominion were £6,642,171
ahead of it on the year. Yet the demented
country has the unspeakable nerve to go on
cadging six millions a year from harassed
John Bull by way of loan. To send young
men to fight on a p.n. and allow 7 the old
men to hang on like grim death to the pro-
ceeds of the fat lamb and the w r ater-logged
butter wears the look of the meanest thing
on earth.

panies in Australia, or he will do far more
harm than good. Granted that Australia’s
first duty is to win the war, it also has
the big responsibility of “capturing German
trade,” and it can’t capture much trade
without first investing capital. It would be
far more sensible to prevent people dropping
their surplus money into a bank on fixed
deposit than to stop them from risking it in
labor-giving industries. Above all the people
who need handcuffing are the State politi-
cians who are spending millions in monkey
cages, elephant temples and other unpro-
ductive works or works that won’t be imme-
diately productive .and can well stand over
till the war drain is past. But that most
important thing of all is impossible without
unification.
From a cynic in the trade
There is something very wooden about this new
cult of government by regulation. General Saturday
closing was given its first test in the country in Vic-
toria during a year rendered abnormal by drought
and war. Decreasing trade, due to these causes, was
attributed by harassed shopkeepers to the Saturday
closing, and they yelped accordingly. The panicky
State Government “hedged;” and now the country
traveller can never tell what old day he'll find the
shops shut. Lately the Federal Government has taken
a hand in the regulation of the sugar supply. It has
adopted as its standard last year’s trade:; and decreed
that no distributing house shall jpurghase more sugar
this year than it did in the corresponding period last
year. Last year being drought-stricken there; was
very little fruit, so no jam waff made arid the
retail sugar demand dropped below normal.;. This
year there is ample fruit coming on. to a depleted
domestic market; everyone is anxious? toTmake. jam ;
the sugar demand booms. But wooden "regulation
says: “You bought three tons ;ofe*afigar last Decem-
ber (when there wasn’tfeaity fruit)?:; Therefore three
tons is all you can possibly needs, this year (when
there is plenty); you 'must • be* speculating. 'The
Government is determined; to: p'revght exploiting of
foodstuffs, so you’ll get your next-delivery of sugar
on the umteenth of January, and not before.” The
jam-fruit having rotted, the regulationists will notice
that sugar is accumulating in bond and take steps to
release more of it—when it is no longer wanted. No
doubt there is a fiecessity for judicious food regula-
tion, in none more perhaps than in sugar, but it
might be done with a little savvee. Do the theorists
ever think of consulting a practical man before they
plunge into a fresh scheme?
The British Government has been impress-
in? on educational authorities not to fail in
keeping before the youthful mind the im-
portance of the great national issues ot tne
dav In Australia the schools needn t worry
about this. Our great national issues are
promissory notes, and the youngster w i
never have a chance to forget them so long
as there’s a Cohen to wear a nose.
The A.W.U. conference at Brisbane had
an acrid discussion on a motion to abolish
an honorarium of £3OO a year, with hotel
and travelling expenses, to the I resident.
Finally the motion was well beaten, lnai
means, in effect, that the A.W.U. doesn t
want its boss position to be in the hands of
a Parliamentarian. There is a growing feel-
ing in the big industrial
bodies in favor of the exclu-
sion of members of Parlia-
ment from all official posi-
tions ; and the making of the
President’s a salaried job
was a triumph for the union-
ists who favored the exclu-
sion. Labor ethics are sup-
posed to forbid the man who
has a well-paid legislative
billet from holding any other
sort with cash decorations.
By one vote the House of
Dodery put through the Bill
for a referendum to decide
whether Tasmanian pubs
shall shut up at 6 or 11 or
some time in between. Mean-
time no one does anything
to shut up altogether the
low drinkeries in Hobart
which are a disgrace to any
allegedly civilised city. At
a recent meeting of the
Licensing Bench the police
brought evidence of a most
revolting character about
five of these places, which
appear to be mainly depots
for the spread of acute
venereal disease —especially
of late among soldiers. After
hearing this the Bench re-
newed the licenses, though
in a couple of cases they in-
sisted on a change in the
license-holder. When the
police were asked why
they did not proceed against
these places they said they tried once to
put down solicitation, but got so little
encouragement from the Police Magistrate
that they didn’t try again.
Perversity makes us acquainted with
strange bedfellows. Because the politicians
won’t give Australia a decent tariff the
Yankee swamps this country with his cast-
offs ; wherefore the other day when a Hobart
citizen opened a pretty little sample-packet
of Yankee chicken food which some kind
mainland importer had sent him, he found
if alive with a flour beetle, called for short
Tribolium confusum. Keeping it company
was a select party of the Mediterranean
flour-beetle. Wilson’s tribolium country-

man will eat anything from red pepper and
snuff to damper, and what it doesn’t eat it
spoils. But consider the blazing madness
of importing any sort of chicken food into
a country with a harvest like Australia has
this year!
Among the latest appointments to a State
job in Australia is a “Professor of Instru-
ments of Percussion.” This has nothing to
do with the mere billet of teaching Billjim
how to explode his bomb or hoist the German
over the border with a mine. It refers to the
gentleman who will give instruction to young
Australia in the art of bashing the drum and
smiting the triangle and clashing the cymbal
at the Ma State’s Conservatorium of Music.
And meanwhile Higgs, Federal Treasurer,
is fearfully anxious lest we should make bad
use of our money by putting it into factories
and such reproductive things.
Victorian Chief Secretary McLeod is
alleged to be favorably considering a scheme
for employing prisoners on tree planting on
the lines followed in Maoriland. It is to be
hoped the lines won’t be followed too closely.
Over on the quaky specks the Government
finds a place without trees and forthwith
proceeds to raise j. 50,000,000 seedlings,
sends Sikes to the front, and starts laying-
out a forest of exotic timber. Then it hears
of another place where the scenery is in-
fested * with native bush. Whereupon it
turns the countryside into what someone
calls a “hive of activity,” the bush is felled
and burned and the scenery in a year or
two consists of cocky and cinders. Thus is
the balance of nature preserved and Parlia-
ment furnished with voluminous reports
about (a) the success of tree planting by
prisoners, and (6) the progress of settle-
ment, the said reports being supplied by
officials who get salaries to (1) try to make
forests, (2) succeed in destroying forests.
The “voluntary” idea works as fiercely as
ever. The single men employed in the
power-house, brickyards and arsenal in the
Federal capital territory have been given
notice that their services are not required

PARTIALLY-SUBMERGED SKIPPER HOLMAN:
“We're doing fine —have one with me!”
by the Government, which does not believe
in compulsion. Nobody will compel them
to enlist if they don’t want to; but a little
hint dropped now and again that they may
enlist or starve is supposed to have per-
suasive value. Young Softgoods, the son of
the senior partner in- Softgoods and Co.,
can’t be hit in that way; and that is no
doubt why some unionists who can be hit
consider that outright conscription, which
would cover Algernon as well, is undemo-
cratic.
The present may be a bad time for the N.
S. Wales Education Department to hire
more doctors, but the protest of the Doctors’
Union is all wrong. Immediately the Gov-
ernment’s intention to appoint these men
was announced, the Union leaped forward
to demand a guarantee that “no child would
receive attention whose parents could afford
to pay for treatment,” failing -which the
Government was to be declared black and
no member of the Union would be permitted
to apply for one of the jobs. The request
was unreasonable, because to comply with it
would be impossible. To introduce into the
schools a “pauper test” suggests the intol-
erable. Naturally the. practising Sawbones
is anxious about his fee for removing
Billy’s adenoids or correcting the outline of
little Mary’s tonsils. To him the children
are mere “cases,” which if the father pro-
duces sufficient coin will be promptly dis-
posed of. But the State’s interest in Billy
and Mary is altogether different, and if it
is an enlightened State it feels compelled to
give the youngsters a better chance than they
might get if determination rested solely with
ignorant, parsimonious or poverty stricken
parents.
The Federal land tax, poor as it is, is
hitting up the V.D.L. Co., which has held
for about a century 250.000
acres in the north-west of Tas.,
including some of the finest land
in the State. Before the tax
came the co. used sometimes to
be kind enough to let settlers
clear the land and make farms,
and then pay it a big rent for
the rest of their lives; other
times it mostly fattened bul-
locks. Now it is getting a
wriggle on in clearing land it-
self, cutting it up into farms
and selling it. It has kept from
200 to 300 men at work for two
or three years past, and in the
Ridgeley district alone has
mowed off about 15,000 acres of
scrub. It is now trying to in-
crease its capital from £520,000
to £750,000, in order to finance
a scheme for producing ready-made farms,
complete with buildings, fences, etc., and
selling them on time payment.
“Dwell not in a paradise of fools!” Prime
Minister Billy Hughes thundered at the old
constituents who were farewelling him.
“Don’t let us stick our heads into the sand
of delusion.” No, indeed, why should we.

the censorship, will save us the trouble by
I browing it into our eyes?
AN ASSORTMENT OF SLACKERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sleek wowser slacker objects to the war
Because it’s un-Christian to shed human gore,
And a soldier of Heaven salvation must win.
Ilis soul he is saving whilst saving his skin.
The stockbroker bellows the Anthem, but snorts
At the rubbish we get in newspaper reports ;
When charged to the muzzle with bellicose skite
His feelings he vents at a Stadium “fight.”
His clerk (if he be not a German by birth)
Discusses the war as a matter for mirth,
And would haste, so he says, to partake of the fun
If he were not cocksure the old Kaiser is done.
The shopkeeper, waving with anger his gamp,
Opines that no soldiers should ever leave- camp ;
And, furthermore, thinks that recruiting should cease
If wages would otherwise tend to increase.
The newly-wed merchant hopes all’s going well;
He believes that the Russians are giving them IT—1;
And, anyhow, if the worst comes to the worst,
His wife says that bachelors ought to go first.
And Brother Mock Socialist thunders at length
On the grand Labor maxim that Union is Strength ;
He curses all scabs in his heated'discourse,
lie would keep them from scabbing by physical force.
He thinks Labor Governments ought to make laws
To force those “free-workers” to fight for his Cause.
Pharisaic his scorn for the little word “free”
When applied to peor sinners who are not as he;
But great his respect for the word when he raves
Of freemen, and bondmen, and masters and slaves.
Conscription for him means compulsion to do
The work that too many would leave to the few.
All men are as slaves, wearing shackles and gyves,
If they must go and fight for their sweethearts and
wives.
If they must keep Britannia supreme on the waves
By joining the army—why, then, they are slaves.
The good cause of Labor a statesman betrays
Who pleads for compulsion, Mock Socialist says.
Then stand up united ; ’twere better to fall
If manhood-conscription would vex a trades hall!
Mock Socialist stands, like a man, on his right
To the freedom of speech for which better men
fight;
He stands for the freedom to shirk and to slack,
For the freedom to strike where there’s no hitting
back!
There’s a word which of late in our nostrils has
stunk:
It it “Freedom” —befouled by suspicion of Funk.

NOTIONS
“Red” Watson, the hard-hitting, thick-
necked warrior from the U.S.A., and Fritz Maki, who
hails from Finland, came together at Sydney Sta-
dium on Saturday and had a fierce, confused dis-
turbance which went the whole journey. At the end
Maki took the verdict, mainly because he is the
better boxer and his defence had more points of
merit than Watson’s wild swings and fearsome bashes
that landed nowhere. Watson is a very aggressive
individual, and if he could only deposit his aggres-
siveness at the right place there are not many men
of his weight and inches who could stay with him.
But he only deposits one occasionally, and if it isn’t
an absolute woodenev then Watson doesn’t win.
Llew Edwards, the British featherweight
champion, who since coming to Australia had up-
ended Jimmy Hill and Taylor, heard the referee rule
against him, for the first time in his life, at the
end of 20 rounds with Charlie Simpson at Melbourne
on Saturday. As this clearly calls for a further dis-
turbance the lads left the ring in hopes of another
and more joyful reunion.
Fritz Hollaud had another win at Bris-
bane on Saturday, cleaning up Mick King, the Syd-
ney middleweight, and, incidentally, adding another
to the numerous losses accumulated lately by Michael.
Of course Mick will win again sometime or other,
but stacking him up against the first flighters must
be taking the heart out of him. He doesn’t belong
there, anvhow.

Les Darcy needs a good, sensible, strong-
minded manager. After pulverising Billy Murray for
the first time, Darcy’s fingers, ordinarily outsizos,
were puffed to an enormous extent. Notwithstand-
ing this, he agreed to meet heavyweight Harry Reeve,
and only drew out at the earnest solicitation of a
well-known pressman. After beating MeGoortv,
Clabby and co. he went on a theatrical jaunt, to the
country, and returned to meet McGoorty the second
time. Fortunately he had the services of a past-
master in the art of training, and all went well.
Since then Darcy has given vaudeville shows in Mel-
bourne, with Colin Bell as sparring partner, and has
returned to Sydney with badly-puffed hands and
much above himself in condition. A few more such
experiences and Darcy’s hands will be permanently
disabled. If he wants to continue as a champion
boxer he will have to cut out the theatre as a sand-
wich between contests—which take place far too fre-
quently. Sydnev Stadium, Ltd., is out to make
money, and would match Darcy every day, but it’s
no part of his game to be so obliging.
- * # * *
“Rex”: Remarkable how eager bruisers
are to hitch up with. Darcy. Not that they think
they have any chance of winning; but they are
content to take a thumping for their share of the
gate that Darcy draws. “Dago” Brown, who was
pounded as never before, is anxious to have another
go at the Australian, and the public will pay big
money to see the fun. Jimmy Clabby, like Brown,
was outclassed by Darcy, but the pair will meet
again, this time at Brisbane. Also, McGoorty, Hard-
wick and Colin Bell are talking business. Hardwick
wants Darcy to fight him for the heavyweight cham-
pionship, and Bell is bursting with anxiety for any old
scrap with Les. Colin Bell lias been sparring with
the Maitland boy for some time. . Meanwhile, Darcy
requires a whole heap of looking after regarding
matchmaking, training, and the care of his hands.

The imported blood again! On the first
day of the A.J.C. Anniversary meeting five of the
six races fell to the progeny of an oversea horse.
The exception, Isle of Skye (Wallace-Zoraya), was
so little thought of in the Nursery Handicap that he
was scarcely mentioned in the betting, very few of
the books writing his name. Yet he was reckoned
worth £lOOO when S. P. Mackay acquired him at
last year’s sales. Seventeen went after the £750
offered for the Challenge Stakes, and as is usual in
this race the winner was hard to find. Punters
trusted Athenic (Bst. 71b.) with most of their cash,
and weighed in heavily on Brattle (Bst. 121 b.) and
Trigon (7st. 91b.). Any one of them looked a good bet
-—and all three of them were beaten clean out of
place. Quinn’s Post (7st.), a 25 to 1 chance that
had run recently with no distinction, bounced over
the six furlongs in lmin. 131 sec., and was a length
ahead of Rosedell at the end. Athenic ran like a
mule. In the Centenary Stakes the often-disappoint-
ing Giru came to light at 6 to 4, Flash of Steel
next, and Canzone (who once more resented being
asked to hurry up) struggling in third. The mile
was run in “39j,” and this time was equalled by
Kenilera in the Trial, where red-hot favorite Machine
Boy (5 to 2 on) went down with the good old-
fashioned thud. But Giro carried 181 b. more over
the journey than the other.
N.S.W. Chief Secretary Black has issued
a notification that only racecourses with a cement floor
in their weighing enclosures will be granted regis-
tration. This looks like the death-knock to the
industrious crooks who have had a fine time tun-
nelling under weighbridges on racecourses in N.S.W.
Western districts during the past few years.

Country Belle, the crack trotting mare of
Maoriland and holder of the Australasian mile and
two-miles records, who has just been retired to the
stud, has during her brilliant career collected over
£3OOO in stake money on M.L. tracks.
* * * #
Desert Gold. T. H. Lowry’s brilliant All
Black-Aurarius filly, continues to hang records
around her name in Loan Land. This season, as a
three-year-old, she has started eight times and
scored eight successive firsts. To date she has
collected £9015 in stake money, £5350 of it this
season. Last year Reputation amassed £4690,
which was the largest amount ever earned by a
three-year-old in the Loanly Isles; but Desert Gold
has five months yet to go and a lot of important
engagements ahead. Warstep’s Maoriland record
stands at £10,190, with £9OO of it earned as a five-
year-old ; and, although only on the track half as
long as the wonderful Chch. mare, Desert Gold is
already within £1075 of her total. She will pro-
bably pass it before the season is ended. Her
eight races as a three-year-old have been won in
record time, which in itself is a performance that
will take some beating. Often she has knocked
seconds off the previous best. In her latest effort
she left the 1J miles of the Northern Derby behind
at Auckland in 2min. 32 3-ssec., which equals the
M.L. record for the distance put up by Miss Mis-
chief when she won the Club Handicap on the same
course in 1911. All Desert Gold’s races this year
have been won in the same manner —going to the
front at the jump and leading by lengths aU the
way. She is certainly the greatest three-year-old
prad Loan Land has produced and looks like devel-
oping into the greatest mare that has yet raced
down south. Lowry 7 talks of showing his fine nag
to Australia next season.
* * * *
Egypt, Desert Gold’s two-year-old brother,
looks like developing into another cash-collecting
machine for T. IL Lowry. In five starts this season he
has always got a place, having had one win, three
seconds and a third. The mighty Desert Gold, who
established a record as a two-year-old in M.L.,
didn’t make a better start than that. A lot of
good judges, who probably don't know anything,
reckon Egypt will prove to be the best two-year-old
in the lOU Isles this season.
* * * *
“Punter”: Place-betting is not so much in
fashion in Australia as it is on the English turf.
Hitherto our sports who indulge in it have had to
worry along under rules drawn up by Ikev Moses.
Having an idea that the bookie-made rules were
not the thing, the V.R.C. has now adopted the
English rules governing place-betting. In future
the layer must pay on three places if the starters
are eight or over, but only on two places if the
starters are seven or less. This seems fair enough
for course betting, but the punter who picks “first,
second or third” off the course is handicapped.
Supposing that there are 20 probable starters on
the official programme, the “long distance” punter
can’t know how many are “stiff.” If he isn’t to
get a run for third place the rate of odds ought to
vary should 13 of the probable field be scratched.
AT CAULFIELD.
“0.K.” A par. in Melbourne Argus tells
me that “Henry Steel, known as the late King
Edwards betting agent,” died recently with £645,373
to his credit, and that he was the original partner
of William Peech, who died long previously worth
half a million. If this Steel was the partner of the
first bookmaker Peech, and not a son of that large,
loud, ignorant person, he must have been very old —-
nearer 90 than 80. Steel was the “leviathan” book-
maker of the English turf half a century ago. Decid-
ing to live among the “nobs” in London he bought a
house in a fashionable square, the Bishop of London
being his next-door neighbor. There was a great
gathering of brother books and blokes at Steel’s first
Sunday dinner-party in the new abode, and the guests
lounged out upon the first-floor blacony and talked
lurid language in loud tones. Next day a liveried
servant from next door delivered a little note into
the hand of Steel’s gorgeously plushed footman.
Here’s the ver\ 7 note. “The Bishop of London pre-
sents his compliments, with the suggestion that he
should be informed in future of Mr. Steel’s intention
to entertain friends, that he may take the precaution
of keeping his windows closed.” Steel, though he made
a joke of the Bishop’s letter, had the good sense to
accept the lesson, and he sold his house or let it to
somebody more genteel than his bloomin’ self. He
abandoned the idea of dwelling among the “nobs,”
and was content to live on his reputation for settling
with them—prompt cash.
The biggest and wealthiest bettors did their busi-
ness with “leviathan” Steel, as a matter of course.
The year when Scotch ironmaster James Merry won
the Epsom Derby with Doncaster and the Oaks with
Marie Stuart it pleased the eccentric Lord Dudley
(son of the more eccentric Dudley and father of Aus-
tralia’s former G.-G.) to seek some excitement on
the turf. He made two or three wagers with Steel
and won £40,000. On the following Monday, at Tat-
tersall’s, when the bookmaker handed over 40 crisp
new notes for £lOOO each, his Lordship was pleased
to be facetious: “Really, Mr. Steel, I feel sorry for
you; it’s a shame to take the money,” or words to
that effect. “Don’t feel sorry for me, my Lord,”
said the fat man from Sheffield. “Play with me
long enough and I’ll get it all back.” And he did.
At Ascot that year, or next, Dudley did some sensa-
tional plunging, one of his bets being £30,000 to
£lO,OOO on a great horse called Petrarch. The cer-
tainty somehow failed to run up to form. All the
toffs were plunging on Petrarch, and it was the busi-
ness of other books, not as true as Steel, to see that
the good thing didn’t win. Then Dudley gave up
plunging as a game in which no millionaire could
expect to shine for long.
Peech and Steel, one of whom had been quite
illiterate when they started bookmaking on the
Sheffield pedestrian handicaps, were not the onjy
rough diamonds of their period nor the only
ful ones. The richest of the “turf commission
agents” was George Herring, who left a fortune of
nearly 1* millions. rfut the HerrmgbrotherS’
William and George, were not public bookmakers.
They worked on eonlmissions of all sorts, and the
Rothschilds were their patrons in particular.*
From S. M. Herald (21/1/T6) :
“He is the antithesis of his working mate, being
low-set and stocky, yet lengthy, has plenty of reach
when in action, and is very powerfully built. He is
physically stout, of incomparable docility, is very
sagacious, and a beautiful mover. ’
It sounds something: like the description of the super-
lumper, but in reality it is only the Heralds turt
scribe on the jag. Such commendation makes a
mortal wish he were an ’orse.

As the cables told us a while ago Tod
Sloan and a French musical-comedy fairy were
arrested and shipped out of England under the
Defence of the Realm Act —the ex-jockey to the
U.S.A., the fairy to France. Some time earlier in
th war Sloan was engaged driving an ambulance in
France, and it appears that the French authorities
were not too pleased with him. A London writer
savs that the appearance of the show girl in a revue
in' Paris will cause a sensation, particularly as under
the new Parisian regulations she will have to wear
some clothes.

Mossy Israel was being chiacked for not
going to the Front. “For vy iss id I don’d go?’ he
said. “See for yourselluf, the feet is flat. The man

support the Allies. It iss a lie —and I prove it. I
lav 10 to von on.”

The sound of guns across the Channel
reduced the flat-race prize-money last season in Eng-
land to £243,232, which was less than half what
it was in 1914 ( £513,210) and 1913 ( £573,487).

“Imp” : Law 43 in the Cricket Code proves
a stumbling block to cricket associations as well as
to individuals. This law relates to fitness of ground
and light for play, and says the umpires are the
sole arbiters. But in its instructions to umpires
the Marvlebone Club says that, “in the event of the
captains agreeing as to condition of ground or
light, the umpires will, so far, be relieved of their
responsibility.” On December 18 the caretaker of
the Pratten Park ground (where Sydney and Western
Suburbs had to finish their match) decided that the
ground was too wet for play. The N.S.W. Cricket
Association, holding that the umpires were the onlv
persons entitled to judge, awarded the match to
Sydney. A few years ago first-graders Waverlev and
Balmain were to play at Waverlev Oval, on a drizz-
ling day. Sammy Carter and M. IT. Blaxland (the
captains) decided" to play, but the umpires thought
they shouldn’t, and pulled up the stumps. The cap-
tains appealed to the Association, which said the
umpires were correct, whereupon Carter and the
writer (who had in the first instance told the cap-
tains that the starting of play rested with them)
wrote to the M.C.C. Result: the Cricket Association
and umpires were adjudged in the wrong. Another in-
stance of irresponsiblrs interfering was when Ranji
came out with Stoddart’s 1897-8 team. The first
test was to have started in Sydney on a Friday, on
which day Ranji was laid up with quinsy at Armi-
dale. It rained heavily during the week, and the
Ground Committee of the Sydney Cricket Ground,
without consulting the captains, postponed the
match until the Saturday, which proved too wet
for play. A rumpus ensued. When plav started on
the following Monday on a perfect wicket, Ranji
was well, and his 175 had much to do with Eng-
land’s nine-wicket win. That Ground Committee
soon became non-est, as on the suggestion of George
Reid, a letter was sent to each member: “We have
to thank you for your valuable services in the past,”
etc., and out they went. That is the way the inci-
dent was related to the writer by the late Phil
Sheridan, then manager of the Sydney Cricket
Ground. At the time of the postponement Phil
was nursing Ranji at Armidale.

Two sparkles in Sydney grade cricket on
Saturday: Against North Sydney wicket-keeper McKew
stumped four and allowed only 11 byes in a total of
422 ; and B. M. Riley, of ’Varsity, bowled through-
out an innings and got eight wickets for 53 v.
Gordon. The strength of Riley’s effort is shown in
that he bowled 16 overs, while three other trundlers
sent down 16.4 overs and got two wickets for 84 runs.
McKew was in the running for a niche in big cricket
a couple of years ago, but like many other “stump-
ers” hadn’t a chance while Carter held the job.
Riley is one of twin brothers who had a great record
with King’s School last season; his ability to turn
the ball either way on good, hard wickets will keep
him in the running for a seat in bigger cricket —if
there’s to be any in his time.

Joe Darling, for long years captain of the
Australian Eleven, who has turned his bat into a
sheep-crook, is coining money on his Tasmanian wool-
farm. At the recent Hobart sales his clip went up
to 22-]d. per lb., which was only id. below the top
of the market, and the top was the Tasmanian record
for greasy.

A good many English cricketers well
known in Australia are making good scores in the
game of getting the Kaiser out. Poore, the Hamn-
shire man, has risen to the rank of Brigadier-General.
A. C. Maclaren is with the Army Service Corps in
Flanders. Ranji was wounded by an accident at
home after serving in the same locality, but has gone
back with the rank of Major. C. B. Fry is with the
navy. S. M. J. Woods is a lieutenant, big-hitter
Jessop a captain.

Ted Scanlon, who died at Sydney the
other day, was of the old cricket school. He scored
25 runs for N.S.W. v. Victoria in that memorable
1877 inter-State match when' Victoria went down by
an innings and six runs. He was a fearless wicket-
keeper, who carried trophies of smashed hands
through life.

“Montalex” : Much interested by a recent
Bulletin par. concerning the Old English cattle-dog
and the comments upon the tail-docking custom which
has, after 20 centuries, made the animal congeni-
tally stump-tailed. There are not now many physi-
ologists who deny that, given a sufficient lapse of
time, artificially-produced characters will become
permanent. The French poodle, for instance, has
been used as a performing-dog for at least eight
centuries, and the breed has now, beyond all ques-
tion, acquired an inborn facility for walking on the
hind legs. Then we have the gun-dogs and the
lurcher. It has been stated that some young point-
ers will “point” naturally. This I do' not believe,
but I have personally observed that puppies of a
good strain require very little instruction and
will sometimes learn merely from seeing an
older dog at work. The lurcher—the poacher’s
dog—is of no use unless he runs absolutely
silent. He is generally a greyhound-terrier
cross, and has developed, through long-con-
tinued ancestral training, an almost incredible apti-
tude for his special job. Finally, there is the modi-
fication of the dog’s digestive economy to suit his
environment. All the untamed canines are abso-
lutely incapable of assimilating vegetable matter as
food, yet the domestic dog is now best suited bv a
mixed flesh and vegetable diet. Indeed, he is able
to subsist and even grow fat on a purely vegetable
feeding, as witness the Chow—the “edible dog” of
China—and the “poi”-nourished animals that used
to be reserved for the eating of the Polynesian chiefs.
“Slide”: The grumbling in Sydney base-
ball has ended in war. The Association stuck to its
guns and disqualified all who have been perspiring
under the National League banner in summer ’ball;
the League hits back with a communique that it
will launch an opposition winter competition. The
row has this interesting feature: the Association holds
the closed grounds while the League has the players
Another factor which comforts the League is' the
patching of a “peace agreement” in Yankee baseball
after three years’ squabbling between the National,
American and Federal Leagues; and the N.S.W.
League, which holds affiliation with the foreign Base-
ball Association, is hopeful that the proposed Aus-
tralian tour will therefore soon be under weigh.
How. the public will stand a crowd of Yankee base-
ballers rooting round just now is another matter, as
the League will discover.

P. O’Shea, the champion road cyclist of
Maoriland, has heard the Great Call and has changed
his bike for a gun. His mate, F. Griffin, has done
likewise and they are both now training hard in
a new fashion with their eyes on the Front and
the V.C., instead of the electro-plate and the fastest-
time medal.
* * * *
Charles Cook, of the Vacuum Oil Co.
(Melb.), fell a victim to the motor-cycling craze the
other Sunday morning. Spluttering along Sydney
road he ran into a milk-waggon and met his death.
Deceased had assisted his friend Steans in starting
the Australian Motorist paper some years ago, and
supplied it with motor-cycle notes. Both men came
to tragic ends. Poor Steans was doing some clearing
at his week-end place on the Gembrook line when a
tree fell on him and killed him.
* * * *
“Adelaide” : South Aus. has given a good
lead to the other States, and given it early. The
Football League has announced that no programme
will be prepared for what should have been the
coming season, “unless the war should terminate
before or during that period.” It is the proper thing
to do. War and football are rivals, and there is no
room for both of them. Most other sports can be
carried on by those over military age, bv the one-
eyed or the one-armed, or the man with a weak
heart, or ingrowing toenails ; but football, like war,
must have the young and the physically fit. Every
footballer is a possible soldier, so the winter game
will have no excuse this year for showing itself in
public.
* * * *
At the soldiers’ water-carnival on the
Goulburn at Seymour, arranged by the camp as a
sort of farewell to the men about to leave for the
Front, the fatted Captain Jacob Jona bobbed up
serenely and won what looked like the most difficult
event of the day—boxing-on-the-raft. Jona's job at
Seymour consists in prescribing castor-oil for the
soldier and seeing that he takes it.
“Old Hand”: I passed a disconsolate
object in Sydney Harbor the other day. It was
H.M.N.S.W.G.S.Y. Nea, and she had evidently struck
serious trouble. Her funnel, cabins and tophamper
were in a heap on the deck, and her sides were
gaping open. Somebody told me she had bumoed
a wharf. I knew the Nea years ago. In 1880
or thereabouts the reigning Ex. wanted a fast vessel,
and Mort’s Dock evolved the Nea. She was fast
all right. In her sprinting days she was credited
with doing her 14, which was a staggerer in those
times. The designer, however, wasn’t told anything
about his Ex., and the consequence was that when-
ever the craft was opened out she drenched his Nibs
and his Nibs’s suite. A narrow-gutted thing with
fine lines, her fault was incurable, and no Governor
in his Sunday clothes was safe in her past Pinchgut.
Still, her turn of speed made her a val \ble craft
in the big days of sculling, and she was always
umpire’s boat. Once when Beach (I think) was
rowing for the world's championship on the Nepean
a good-natured Government shipped the Nea over-
land bv train to follow the race. I have missed
the lady lately and thought she had gone for a rest
cure, but after her recent jag I’m afraid she won t
do for his Ex. any more.
N. A. Lovejoy gave a miss in baulk the
other day somewhere in England, and the marker
cried “Game!” What Lovejoy had to say for him-
self at the pearly gates is doubtful, but his sins were
heavy on his head, for he caused more trouble in
the billiard players’ world than anyone before or
since. He was the discoverer of the anchor cannon,
a stroke with which Reece once made a break of
499,135 (unfinished). It could have apparently been
continued until Reece perished from senile decay.
When Peall’s spot-stroke was threatened with the
wallon of extermination in matches an immediate
search commenced for something easy. The “jam”
cannon, played in the pocket jaws, was then brought
to light by Lovejoy. With this, after Tom Taylor
had.made 729 consecutive cannons, F. C. Ives ran
up 1267 ; and the thing reached its limit ot horror
when Reece compiled his tremendous break at Soho
Square (London) in 1907. It was then tfiat the
Billiards Association fell on the weary stunt with the
rule restricting the number of successive ball-to-ball
eannons to 25. This, bv the wav, broke up Cook's
rocking cannon, a really scientific shot. It was
played with one ball touching a cushion and the
other almost in a straight line, the cue ball in the
middle. By using a kiss from the ball on the
cushion a rebound was secured to the third ball —
and in the hands of a master the stroke could be
played so truly that the third ball was not moved
and the break could be kept going until Gabriel came
along with his trump.

The season for the wild ducks that flutter
on the Block or the beach is all the year round,
but for the species that positively grows feathers
the Victorian season is mostly closed. True, it
formally opens on the 15th of next month, but no
sportsman may bag more than 15 birds or put
any on the market. Last year they were protected
altogether ; consequently a good growth of toothsome
fowls of the air is reported from Swan Hill and
Benalla and lots of places that their natural enemies
know of.

Lancaster Park, the fine playing ground
at Christchurch (M.L.), has been snatched out of
the hands of Financial Difficulties. Five thousand
pounds were required to satisfy a hungry mortgagee,
and to put the accounts on a satisfactory basis the
hat was energetically rushed round. The fine
response of £5960 was made. The collection ex-
penses were nil, which is what they should be in a
case like this. It is good news. It would have
been a pity if one of the finest sports parks in
Australasia had been cut up and decorated with
modern villas bearing names like “Thelma” and
“Rodena.”

Breathless London cable to Australian
dailies last week :
“Golf clubs are in a sorry plight. Members on
active service are not charged subscriptions. Club-
houses are deserted, and greens have not been cut.
Several clubs have closed down.”
Oh, the horrors of war!
WHEN I AM DEAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When I am “dead,” through no fault of my own—
When I am “dead” to aid some darkling scheme,
Will you sit in the stand, apart, alone,
Mourning in silence for your busted dream?
Or will you rage and storm because I’m “dead,”
Denouncing me and all the horsey gang,
And say that we with all your cash have fled,
And wish us halters so that we may hang ?
I have been “dead” three dozen times or more;
Yet I still dread the death that brings to wreck
The hopes of backers who quite frankly roar,
“I hope the blanker breaks his blanky neck!”

The appointment by the Federal Govern-
ment of Johann August etcetera Ivaysor
to be officer-in-charge of the issue of pass-
ports in Australia was about the limit of
tactlessness. Kaysor is a good officer and
a popular one, and an Australian by birth ;
but he is of German parentage and has a
particularly unfortunate name. Public
opinion being what it is., there was a
natural demand for Kaysor's removal from
the job, and in this the unlucky occupant
decently joined. Ministerial “dignity,”
however, kept the error of judgment from
being righted and a refusal to _ entertain
such a proposal was given to all objectors. In
the end the man himself applied for extended
leave, and this has been graciously approved.
Thus the Ministerial face is saved in a way
that would be comical if it were not so
piti fully childish.

Those oily polishes gather and hold the dust, soiling clothing, linen and every-
thing with which they come in contact. You will find Johnson’s Prepared Wax
just the reverse. It imparts a perfectly hard, dry, glass-like polish, to which
dust and dirt cannot adhere, forming a thin, protecting film over varnish,
adding years to its life. It never becomes sticky or tacky in the hottest
weather, or from the heat of the body, consequently it does not gather dust or
show finger prints.
It Cleans, Polishes and Finishes
with one application. It gives Craftsman furniture that soft, artistic polish so
appropriate to the style. It entirely removes the cloudiness from mahogany,
restoring its original gloss. There is nothing like Johnson’s Prepared Wax for
keeping dining-room tables bright and tempting—hot dishes have no effect what-
ever upon it.

“Hamer”: The enthusiasm sane people
have for thespians is embarrassing. Once
in my wanderings we showed at One Horse
Plain, and there I met an individual who in-
sisted on being introduced to every member
of the company. He became offended because
I didn’t present J. Barrington Galveston to
him. My difficulty was that, outside the
programme, I didn’t know anything of
J. Barrington Galveston. He was a
“double.” But this enthusiast was of
opinion that he was a great actor, although
he spoke few lines. It was his makeup that
made the hit with the enthusiast. Galveston
appeared as a tall man in one piece, a short
man in another, an emaciated person in a
third, and a heavy, bull-necked individual in
a fourth. The wonder'of this achievement
made my new friend all the more desirous
of a meeting, and when I denied any know-
ledge of Galveston and tried to explain
things he became obstinate. He used to
sit on the steps at the stage door half the
night waiting for Galveston to appear, until
it occurred to the rouseabout who acted as
the manager’s aide-de-camp and disorderly
to say that lie was Galveston It was a
great night for the aide-de-camp and dis-
orderly. We discovered him in the bar at
breakfast-time, telling a wild anecdote of
how he had doubled Macbeth and Macduff,
and had slain himself with his own hand
in single combat.
“J.F.H.” : Matheson Lang has added Shy-
lock to liis gallery of dramatic portraits,
with his wife, of course, as Portia. He
makes a fine, impressive Venetian money-
lender. But his wife attracts quite as much
attention by coming into court in doub-
let and riding-boots instead of* wearing the
traditional legal gown. She just throws her
cloak over her shoulders when she rises to
address the Court. An unprofessional inno-
vation, but theatrically most effective.
“Props”: Walter Bentley, actor, and Pat
Finn, journalist, are expressive letter
writers. The histrion on one occasion, wish-
ing to see the pressman, wrote him as
follows: —•
Dear Finn, —Slip up.—Bentley.
and received the following reply:—
Dear Bentley,—Slip down.—Finn.
“0.K.”: The habit of pronouncing the r
as a w is not peculiarly English or con-
fined to the feeble minded —not even on the
stage. Vera Spaull, who plays the girleen
heroine in “Seven Little Australians,” has
this defect in a very pronounced form. Vera,
by the bye, has cultivated the full contralto
tone with which the precocious child-actress
of yesteryear is apt to proclaim her grown-
uppishness. Having strengthened her vocal
cords by much loud talking in infant-
phenomenon parts, she gets, to love the
sound of her voice. The tone is rich and she
emphasises its richness. Parkes,
who had much to say on the stage when
she was very young, soon became deep
contralto conversationalist. Vera. Spaull
issues chest notes similar to Lizette’s. . The
pity of it! A sweet and low voice is an
excellent thing in woman, but the register
musn’t be too low. Sarah Bernhardt’s
“golden drone” was a clear mezzo-soprano
until old age gave it a husky rasp.
“Norbell”: While “Ho Ho” and “Mid
Channel” are exchanging hostilities about
the demand or otherwise for Australian plays
someone ought to say that two highly suc-
cessful native dramas have not been men-
tioned: “Robbery Under Arms” and “The
Sunny South.” Neither of these owed its
popularity to the nigger-farce methods con-
sidered by “Mid Channel” essential to make
an Australian success. Dampier got a run
of nearly three months out of “Robbery” at
Her Majesty’s Theatre, Sydney, in ’!)5, and
that was merely a revival. The play made, a
lot of money for him all through Australia.
Over 30 years ago Darrell did remarkably
well with “Sunny South.” He took it to
London —to the Grand Theatre at Islington,
I think. Dampier also took “nobbery’ to
the Cold Country and produced it at the
Princess’s, London. Both these plays had
great popularity here, and still have life.
At any rate I’ve seen them both played
during the last two years. Dampier was
always keen on Australian drama, and pro-
duced “No Mercy,” “To the West,” “The
Miner’s Right” and many other semi-
successes, but it was Rufus oJawes who
scored best.
“First Old Man”: is too rough
on the Actors’ Association (B. 13/1/T6),
and I suspect him to be a manager in dis-
guise. I can personally testify that the
A.A. is financially helping sick and needy
mummers every week of its life. Every
deserving case receives assistance. In truth,
the Association nowadays does very little
else but dole out money to the members who
are temporarily down. If it becomes a
union it will be able to help in other direc-
tions. But it will never become a union R
the managers (and people like “Busker”)
can prevent it. And the managers, I may
remark, are trying their darnedest to pre-
vent it-
“Efberg”: Poverty' Point grows serious
these days. In the seclusion of its diggings
it is busy producing Works of Art. Tom
Shelford has written a whole barrow-load of
lyric and dramatic verse. There’s not . a
deliberately comic line in the whole off it.
And Ethel Dane is engaged in developing
the plot of a play which is going to startle
the native bears. . . . rr.L. A ~
MY SINGER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She can’t sing much, but still I cling
To olden custom. “Won’t you sing?
Come on, dear, just one song —for me l”
She likes the bit of flattery.
She can’t sing well. I know it now.
But didn’t I kick up a row
The night a silly, unfledged cad
Made jokes about the voice she had!
She can’t sing much —of course, she knows!
I watch her sweet face in repose
And am at peace. No Melba she,
But best in all the world to me.

Old Mel; Sorry don’t agree with you. No
doubt there are men who have gone to England to
enlist because of their special qualifications for
special work ; but nine out of 10 of the youngsters
who have gone have had no special qualifications
and have been merely propelled by snobbery in the
family. As for throwing mud at Melbourne Gram-
mar—Lord, no! A record of 630 enlistments out of
2327 ex-scholars of military age saves it from that.
. ...E.M.L.; Thank you. But we want only the
meat of it. ...Fraser I.: Too vague and whirling.
• Copab.: Surprised at that, are you ? Then you
don’t know what a linotype is capable of doing—the
ungainly brute that has to re-set a whole line in
order to drop in a comma, and is likely to do deadly
things in the process. The result is nine times out
of 10 you’ll leave that necessary comma out in
order to avoid worse things. Your typewriter is a
toy by comparison, yet even it, on this one page, can
try to spell “salicylic” three different ways, and
make a horrible muddle of a simple word like “dis-
agreeable.”... .V.L.D.: One old as the Devil’s grand-
mother; others have musty odor.... The Satyr: You
win. .. .Q.M.P. (or Constant Reader): (1) Don’t
understand the question; (2) you don’t even say
what State you write from ; (3) you haven’t signed
your name. Fix those items up and we’ll get the
information for you... .T.F.M.: Red Page’s opinion
of Compton Mackenzie’s “Sinister Street” was printed
25/3/’l5. (2) Don’t know whether Compton Mac-
kenzie is, was, isn’t, wasn’t, has become or hasn’t
become an R.C. Don’t care. .. .E.H.C.: Four lines:
Then low bowed the Kaizer. “On earth I preached
about you,
Since then I’ve grown much wiser, the Devil should
have his due.”
“I am not unjust,” said Satan, “my due is my de-
mand ;
Your twists you cannot straighten; sorry friend, but
you are damned.”
. ...I.O.: Started as likely comedy and tailed off
into blood and blither. .. .G.R.H.: “Evening” nearly
got through. . . .W.L.H.: You take eight stanzas to say
nothing—badly H.N.: “Are Yer Cornin’?” hasn’t
a chance.... Maphsu: Possibly might do better if you
took trouble. Occasional punctuation helps the
reader... .R.H.: Is it verse or prose? It doesn’t
scan and it doesn’t rhyme and it doesn’t seem to
mean much.... One Tree Hill: Not bad verse ; but you
made a mistake in trying the same theme. It needs
a master to handle that without making it crudely
repulsive... .Eclipse: Bad verse; rotten story; no
hint of humor... .Nauticus: Horrible. Pompous and
ungrammatical P.P.: “The Late Return” is no
good. What is a “clarine sound,” anyhow?....
Dolly Dash: Dash Dolly, who writes on paper two
feet wide. Yarn no good, anyhow W.G.8.:
Scoundrel John R.: Out Westnor: Not up;
but “Where Extremes Meet” nearly slipped past
Monarda: No use whatever. Gondola yarn belongs
geologically to the Old Red Sandstone period. It has
been told 11,756 times a week ever since... .F.R.:
“Hard Luck” is out. Write of things you know
about and use the language you speak... .R.S.: Not
nearly up. Take more trouble W.G.H.: Nothing
indelicate about it. It’s just very poor, moderately
correct verse H.M.: But what does it mean?
C.H.R.: What is a Drean? And how do you catch
Prims Donnahs? Rally: Not nearly up*... Vi et
Armis: Same subject better handled by other writers.
. ...R.C.D.: Story too obviously manufactured....
Bellerive: One sad, sweet fragment:—
Stricken by pneumonia
Then a chill at a show,
The hand of death fell
Upon the vaudeville pro.
Alas, sudden and sad
From our living throng,
Did eat the mustard—•
No, no, that’s wrong!
Did exit the minstrel
Of wit and song.
With Sheridan and Coghills
Of bygone fame,
As an actor mimic
He established his name.
....Rab: Now is it really “the fairest picture,” or
is that just a conventional lie? Wouldn’t she look
better, for instance, under a decent tree, reading a
decent book? E.D.: “Luck of a Kind” isn’t much
of a story and seems to end nowhere.. . .J.A.T.:
Your alleged verse is bad prose with a rhyme or two
thrown at it. .. .R.R.R. : “They Call It War” shows
some promise if you are as young as your writing
100k5.... Jee Rusalem: Yarn not worth all that
space... .C. 8.: Don’t know him.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
Drif: 111-timed; there’s no chance of Hogwilliam
fleeing for safety to his Potsdam dugout just yet.
....Pug: Some humor in it,-but not quite up
G.H.D.: Your Tommy-Kangaroos don’t pass the medi.
cal test. .. .0.5. K.: The old gag knocked out the
drawing... .Jas. P.: You have everything to learn.
H.D.: Drawing scratchy; pun scratched
C.R.G.: Poor stuff Amb P.: Horrible. And let’s
give you a friendly hint. The circulation of a thing
like that just now, even among your friends, is
likely to land you in gaol for six months.
“Mechanic”: At the factory where I toil
there are 20 hands working, half of them
girls. Five of the men are eligible for ser-
vice. Their ideas on the subject run this
way:—•
A. —Scotch immigrant, 23, able-bodied, unmarried,
says he won’t enlist because it would break his
poor old mother’s heart. (Factory diagnosis, funk.)
B. —Another immigrant, likewise qualified. Can-
not see his way to chuck up 12s. 6d. a day of eight
hours, time-and-a-half for overtime, for five bob a
day and no overtime, with a probable wound chucked
in. (Factory diagnosis, Greed.)
C. —Another immigrant, 21, unmarried, devout
and connected with some sort of “brethren” ; hopes
soon to be a local preacher. Will wait till the bar
loafers and racecourse vagabonds are used up, he
being better than they. (Factory diagnosis, Wow-
ser.)
D. —Name of Schon; says he’s an Italian, speaks
with a German accent. Won’t go till Holman goes.
(Diagnosis, not needed.)
E. —Bill the Boy, 19, very much Australian. Will
go at the end of the cricket season. (Factory
diagnosis, an ass.)
From another factory that we work-in with
22 have gcjpe to the war, and their places
have been mostly filled with immigrants of
fighting age. That shows the splendid jus-
of voluntaryism.

IN
BANANA LAND
Brisbane has an interesting legal case in
the wind. Recently the Supreme Court
ordered the sale of a four-masted schooner
to satisfy certain debtors; but when the
ark was auctioned the highest bid was only
£1125, which the bailiff declared did not
cover the debts owing. He therefore ad-
journed the proceedings without knocking
down the vessel; and now the man who bid
£1125 claims that as the Supreme Court
placed no reserve on the ark it is his
legal property at that price. And Costs
prepare to bite something solid.
“The Nomad” : The rabbit in Bananaland
is at last losing his freedom and is about
to be conscript l '! for commercial purposes.
Previous Gov* .ments have forbidden the
trapping of bi uies for marketing because it
might be an inducement to trappers to breed
them! While the rabbit family is as numer-
ous as at present in Western Queensland, it
would be nearly as sane to grow gum-trees
in pots as to bother about breed-
ing the furry pest. However, the pre-
sent Labor Government has lifted the
ban; and already one firm lias erected
freezing works on the South-Western
line, while Curtis and Co., of Sydney, who
understand the bunny market from experi-
ence in the Ma State, have also received
permission to butt into the industry in
Bananaland. Considering the present but-
chers’ charges for sheep and cow, one won-
ders if the squatters’ ring had anything to
do with keeping Brer Rabbit so long out of
the safe and larder.
“Itan”: Dan Jones, an incessant battler
for cotton-growing, still clings to his old
hopes that Queensland will yet do it in a
big way. In his suburban plot he has
raised two hybrids which he declares yield
fibre superior to the earavonica of the North.
What the farmers want is to be assured of
a market and seed of the right sorts, for
cocky is a terror to sit on the fence till the
time is ripe. The opportunity to start the
business is unique because of the national
needs and the fact that it will be imperative
shortly to move new industrial wheels. Cot-
ton will grow in almost any part of the
State, will stand drought better than almost
any other crop, needs planting only every
second year, can be harvested to suit the
convenience of the farmer as the open bolls
are not injured by the weather, is easily
raised, is specially adapted to a farmer of
small means, lends itself well as an auxiliary
to most other land industries, and has other
qualities. Soon returned soldiers will be
asking for work. Great Britain may want to
know if we can do with a few thousand un-
employed. Asia will be wondering if anyone
is going to use Australia’s empty North. In
the manufacture of textiles cotton is essen-
tial. Cotton looks like filling the bill.
Wherefore, in a loud voice, “What is the
Queensland Government going to do about
cotton ?”
G. S. Hart, of Mount Morgan, makes a
few excellent points on the munitions ques-
tion. A 15-inch shell requires, he says, 5001 b.
of guncotton. Why should not Bananaland,
which grows cotton to perfection, raise cot-
ton for gun-feed? Queensland is fussing
itself to turn out a few hundred small shells
in its railway workshops—a task for which
it is ill-fitted —when it might be producing
hundreds of thousands of pounds of cotton
and helping the Empire to much better effect.
Incidentally the Queensland farmer would
also be making a handsome profit out of the
crop just as his forebears did 50 years ago.
“Gurin”: Re “Parthunga’s” par. (B.
30/12/’l5) on ’roo tail sinews. They aren’t
ali imported from America, as I have several
times in the interests of science sent a lot
to Australian doctors to prepare for their
own use. If Queensland bushmen were
appealed to I am confident that any amount
would be forthcoming for the A.M.C. They
can be preserved indefinitely in alcohol —
and the A.M.C. would probably be grateful.
Just prior to the war a German, who treated
the sinews here, sent several pounds’ weight
of the prepared article to the Huns’ medical
stores as a loyal offering He received a
curt reply to the effect that the Kaiser’s
army accepted gifts from no one. Wonder
what would happen now if he offered a ton or
two of copper?
Re those mechanical water-finders: —
William Thompson, of Watermark (N.S.W.), tried
several diviners, and following their instructions
made holes in the ground, some to a depth of 480 ft.
No water was found, and he was cursing the general
hopelessness of things when he heard of the electric
machine. After getting advice from Queensland
Artesian Department he set the affair going, and
has now reported results. He found that wherever
it was placed the needle pointed towards one spot.
There he bored, and struck “unlimited” water at
350 ft. The theory is that electric currents follow
underground streams, and the indicator jumps
towards them.
IN THESE DAYS OF THE WHITE SLAVERS.
THE LADY (engaging domestic): “Another thing, I’m very particular regarding
followers.”
THE GIRL: “Same ’ere, Mum. Y’r can’t be too careful nowadays.”
A Logan man writes with pride to allege
that out of 112 funerals in his district in
1915 31 chiefly concerned persons of over TO.
The ages ran from 70 to 96. And tenacity
of life in Queensland doesn't confine itself
to the human race either. The other day a
Towers doctor informed the Town Council
that it was not sufficient to boil water to
kill the Northern microbe. He himself
always boiled his drinking water from 15 to
20 minutes, and found that none too long.
“Musketoon” : What about this for a sol-
dier’s record? Staff-Sergeant-Major Taylor,
who took on the job of drilling the “Boom-
erangs” at Forbes (N.S.W.), first saw ser-
vice in the Matabele war of ’96, in which he
was recommended for a V.C., but got a
D.C.M. instead. He was the first Australian
ever recommended for the Cross and the
first to get the medal. He carried a gun in
the Bechuanaland war of ’97, the Boer back-
talk (1899-1902) and Somaliland (1903), and
had a look at the Swazi and Zulu risings
afterwards. Pie was with Botha during the
rumpus in German West Africa last year,
and in October came back to Australia.
Taylor was born on the Hawkesbury
(N.S.W.), and in his peaceful moments
plants sugar on a farm at Bundaberg.
Although in the thick of the war-game for
19 years he has never been wounded nor had
a day’s sickness.
“Barcoo”: The knell has struck for the
shanties along the river tracks and coach
routes inland. The high-power motor-cars
and lorries which have come to stay are
their undoing. Cobb’s chariots are no more,
and the motor passes the roadside pub with
a screech of its horn at 25 miles an hour.
The picturesque teamster is at vanishing
point. The powered lorry now covers as
much distance in an hour as the other-day
waggon did from sun to sun. The bush
worker and shearer proceed to and
from their job by petrol, and the cheques
we used to ‘blew at the Bushman’s Retreat
are now better spent “closer-in.”
The State-school teachers, who have long
advocated militant unionism to remove the
scandal of under-pay from their ranks, are
more determined than ever to pinch the
Department by combining. They recently
asked the Minister for registration as an
industrial union, but found there was no law
to allow of this. For that they can thank
the Fossils who, last session, threw out the
clause in a measure which legalised unions
of the civil service. These teachers are
notoriously under-paid. Politicians know
that, but no Government has yet been game
to give them justice. A Court might. So
the teachers will save one for their friends
when they get a chance to vote for the aboli-
tion of the House of Top Hats.
J. W. Strachan, of Brisbane, shows with
pride a little mill-diary in which stands the
record of the first Queensland-grown sugar
he made 50 years ago for Captain Hope, of
Cleveland. Hope would hate continued in
the industry, but Parliament looked on him
as a dreamer, gave him no encouragement,
and even refused him a small grant of
Northern land for experimental purposes.
Finlayson, M.P., at Maryborough:—
We are going to have a better future than we had
in the past.
Certainly—also a worse present than we had
before the future arrived to make the day
after to-morrow the day preceding yesterday.
These are the immutable truths of politics,
the crystallisation of all human experience
at the ballot box; and the nation that neg-
lects to make them its guiding stars is off
the track that leadeth to Righteousness.
‘■Bill”: A word of warning to travellers
who intend using the caterpillar express that
crawls to Ivingaroy. The Railway Commis-
sioner provides no rations for the departmen-
tal live stock. Like the porters the
stock depend upon the generosity of
passengers. A surprise attack that
lifted one traveller clean off his seat
the other day was the commencement
of a feud which lasted all the way. On the
return journey the traveller had* to fortify
his optimism with a large tin of insectibane
Gas.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
One man ambled painfully on crutches and was

have suffered their outward demeanor did not show

I put in a drag at Ca-i-ro,
I put in a month at ’Zac,
And then I’d the luck
With a bomb to be struck,
An’ I put in three months on me back.
I’m ’ome from the trenches a ’ero,
I’m usin’ a stick when I walk,
But I’d rather the guns
Of the Turks an’ the ’Uns
Than the bunkum these aldermen talk.
Bow! Wow!
’Struth! Can’t these tame cockatoos talk !
I’ve known the ’orrors of battle,
When the enemy trenches we'd storm,
An’ the ’orrors I know
Of the blanky M.O.
With ’is probe an’ ’is damn clorrvform!
In the ward when I’ve heard the blokes
yabber,
Nearly barmy, an’ far from perlite—
Well, it near made me blush
When the Sisters said: “ ’Ush !”
But I did blush at Bodgers’s skite.
Quack! Quack!
Straight! I’d rather the war than ’is skite!
I’ve a blue an’ red badge on me shoulder,
Z.O. plaster an’ gauze on me chest,
An’ me wound they keep warm
With this i-odor-form,
An’, dinkum ! its smell ain’t the best.
But I’d sooner the caustic an’ forceps,
An’ I’d sooner Gallipoli beach
Than I’d “’Shun!” on parade
When addresses is made
An’ listen to Bodgers’s speech !
Yap! Yap!
The cow knocks yer out with a speech!

diers returned to Queensland this week.
With them was a Brisbane girl, Sister Hart,
one of the first nurses to go from this State
on service.
Dr. Jim Duhig, one of Nudgee’s brilliant
young scholars, and a nephew of Archbishop
Duhig, has put up his brass plate in Ipswich,
where Dr. Flynn has taken him into partner-
ship.
Governor Goold-Adams rolled up his
sleeves, lashed on his bowyangs and got to
work on Tuesday night. His job was to be
ganger of a lecture contract in the School
of Arts, undertaken for the benefit of the
State-school teachers assembled in annual
conference. Inspector C. Long, M.A.. an
inspector of schools from Victoria, was the
lecturer.
The Teachers’ Union conference was the
twenty-eighth, and delegates from the four
coiners and middle of the State talked their
troubles over for three broiling days. The
chief complaint against the Government was
the failure of the latter to increase their
salaries. Nobody has more cause to be
enthusiastic on this subject than the school
marm and the school master —especially the
school marm. Minister Hardacre and his
under-secretary took part in the formalities
of the congress. I suppose you would call
the civic reception and a river trip formali-
ties. They were merely opportunities for
speech-making.
Workers in patriotic spheres have had a
few weeks’ holiday and regained fresh
energy, and now all the wheels are moving
without a creak. The five miles of pennies
which was Mrs. (Justice) Chubb's objective
for the benefit of the Red Cross and wounded
soldiers is almost completed. I think there
is only one furlong and two and a half
perches to be covered.
The latest move in a patriotic direction
is the formation of a branch of the Babies’
Kit Society. Mrs. Campbell Riley, having
started the idea and got it to work on
a satisfactory basis, lias with her daughters
departed for a holiday in Tasmania.
The members of the Catholic Club are
putting their heads together devising ways
and means to provide rest tents at all the
military camps. Incidentally, a newly-
erected stadium within the military zone is
one of the inducements which the authorities
can now offer to enlisted men to keep off
the streets and out of the bars. It was
opened this week by the State Commandant,
supported by other important military per-
sonages. Arrangements are being made for
so much entertainment there that the boys
have named it the White City.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
“The Office Curate”: Australia breaks
ground iu a hitherto untouched paddock—
Biblical scholarships. When Methuens, the
London publishers, set on foot their “West-
minster Commentaries,” a few years ago,
they announced that the volumes would
represent the work of the best living
scholars; and in the few instalments of the
series yet published they have kept their
word, for the authors have been men world-
famous in their own line. Now Canon Mick-
lem, who runs an Anglican training college
at Nundah, lias been called to the Cold
Country to see through the press his com-
mentary on St. Matthew’s Gospel as one of
the Westminster series. Anglican bishops
in Bananaland have laid themselves out for
years past to secure cultured parsons and
raise the generally low level of education
among Australian clergy: and Micklem’s
achievement is one of the first fruits of this
policy. He won brilliant honors at Oxford,
and was snapped up by Archbishop Donald-
son some years ago to teach sky-pilotage to
the rare Queensland youth who hankers
after that. knowledge. Micklem is still under
40, and is one of the first favorites for
an Australian mitre in the near future.
“Itan”: The flying-fox, which takes an
annual excursion trip down the Australian
coast from New Guinea for the good of his
health, is particularly aggressive this year. He
seems to follow the figtree fruit-season as it
extends south, which, lucky for him, is
coincident with the mango season. The
drought this year has made a fruit scarcity
and the fox has been obliged to alter his
plans a little. Usually he was shy in the
daylight and slept off his nightly debauch in
the seclusion of scrubs or in mountain fast-
nesses. This year he has not bothered to
play the hiding game. He just camps in any
old place. The Brisbane Botanic Garden
has been a favorite rendezvous; at times the
marauder may be found even in the street
trees, or sleeping peacefully where he last
fed. Half the staff of the Education De-
partment the other day spent the meal hour
trying to spear one which was reposing in a
tree in the courtyard. There has been a
great campaign of assault in the coastal dis-
tricts, so that the protection societies which
pay bonuses are nearly bankrupt. One
man earned £25 in two weeks with his
gun. A new offensive is being prepared for
next spring. But perhaps you have heard
that before.
A ictorian Scotchbyterian clergy, in holy
synod assembled at Ballarat, lately con-
sidered the skimpiness of their screws, the
increased cost of living and other matters,
and opined that the time had arrived to
apply to the Arbitration Court for increased
wages or go on strike or something. It is
to be hoped these sweated ministers will take
some large, vigorous step, but the direction
iii which they should stride isn’t plain.
M horn shall they cite as respondents? The
Moderator is merely a foreman ; the employer
is the church-going public. And if they ff°
on strike the painful probability is that the
employer will merely say his prayers at
home and let them stop on strike. Like a
few other people, the parson is discovering
that the voluntary system doesn’t give a fair
chance in the conflict with the Devil, whether
lie lives in Hell or Potsdam.

Getting Rid of Feminine
Moustaches.
“Practical Suggestions.”
To women who are annoyed by disfiguring
downy hair-growths a method of permanently
eradicating the same will come as a piece of
good news. For this purpose pure powdered
pheminol may be used. Almost any chemist
should be able to supply an ounce of this
drug. The recommended treatment is de-
signed not only to remove the disfiguring
growth instantly, leaving no trace, but also
to actually kill the hair roots without irritat-
ing the skin.
How to have Thick and
Pretty Hair.
“Home Talents.”
Soaps and artificial shampoos ruin many
beautiful heads of hair. Few people know
that a teaspoonful of good stallax dissolved
in a cup of hot water has a natural affinity
for the hair and makes the most delightful
shampoo imaginable. It leaves the hair
brilliant, soft and wavy, cleanses the scalp
completely, and greatly stimulates the hair
growth. The only drawback is that stallax
seems rather expensive. It comes to the
chemist only in sealed ilb. packages, which
retail at half-a-crown. However, as this is
sufficient for twenty-five or thirty shampoos,
it really works out very cheaply in the end.

James Robert Laing died early this
month in London. About half a century
back he was senior partner in the Melbourne
firm of Laing and Webster, of Flinders-lane.
In the ’seventies he and J. M. Bruce seceded
and joining John Paterson formed Paterson,
Laing and Bruce, which for many years has
been the foremost wholesale fluff house in
Melbourne.
Victor Waine is wounded in England;
Captain Jack Waine is at Kut-el-Amara with
the R.A.M.C., which has been transferred to
the Mesopotamia division. They are the
sons of J. C. Waine, a contractor, many
years Sydney alderman, opponent of John
Norton in a Surry Hills election, and Major
in the old St. George’s Rifles. There he and
his Colonel. “Jawbone” Xeild. came to log-
gerheads. The irate Xeild accused Waine of
“making a lunar” at him as he passed the
City bowling-green, and there was a court-
martial which kept Sydney amused for a
week.
More awful results of State Socialism!
A few years ago the Tasmanian Education
Department went into the business of sup-
plying the State schools with schoolbooks
and materials. Now it finds it is making
enough profit to provide, for a start, one
L’niversity scholarship each year to the
pupil who completes the best course at a
State high school. The prizewinner will get
£5O per year towards an approved Univer-
sity course, either at the Tasmanian Uni.
or on the mainland. And Private Enter-
prise, quite unashamed, is yelling because
this money is to be reserved to the children
of the State schools, and wants the scholar-
ships thrown open to the private secondary
schools.
“Corkscrew”: The other day Westralian
Premier Scaddan retired to his country seat
for a holiday. It will be the last time Jack
will have the chance to do so —as Premier,
anyway. If a general election takes place
shortly after June and Labor wins, Col-
lier will be Lord High Executioner. If, on
the other hand, the Liberals get in. Frank
Wilson will be Premier once more, and will
kick out all poor Scaddan’s State enterprises
—and borrow just as furiously for other
things. God help this sand-stricken State!
It has an idea that it governs itself: but it
doesn’t and never will till it has the refer-
endum, through which the public can say
“Yes” or “No” on any specific point of
policy.
“Hamer”: A few people were furtively
lingering about to see the fun. On the
steps leading to Jones’s verandah were two
young men, whom Jones, standing above,
with a paper in his hand, addressed with
wrath. "Strapping young fellows.” he bel-
lowed, “military age and all. doing this
instead of heeding the call of the Empire!
Why don't you be men. and enlist instead of
coming here with your paltry bills and your
talk of summonses—pah! What is Blog-
ger’s bill to bravery? What are the angry
threats of Chiffon to Australia? What is
endless dunning to an empire in the furnace
of war I Be Men ! Be Hen /” With a ges-
ture of finality Jones made scraps of blue
paper of the things in his hands, flung them
over the young men. and the door banged.
The place where Billjim is going to plant
his figtree and coax butter from Strawberry
has been the theme of a yarn by J. C- Wat-
son. who is running this business. It was
a long yarn, and in the main beautifully in-
definite, but it looks as if the job is to be
pretty nearly as expensive as running a
war. There is to be railway construction
(borrow), resumption of estates (deben-
ture). establishment of experiment farms
(pawn-ticket), advances (loan), purchase of
stock (IOU). and plentiful circumlocution
and officialdom. As for relying on land
purchase as a way out. Hughes ought to
know and no doubt does know that to even
talk of it is preposterous. It has been trmd
and failed in peace. To provide 10,001
farms Australia has under this system
already borrowed £10,000.000 to meet the cost
of the land alone. Can Hughes or anyone
else contemplate a repetition of that on top
of the staggering debt the war is heaping on
the nation?
Amongst the relics of old times pre-
served in Hobart is a skull which is alleged
to be that of Alexander Pearce, the original
of Mat Gabbett in “For the Term of His
Natural Life.” Pearce, once a pieman in
Hobart Town, fell foul of the law and was
retransported to the penal settlement of
Macquarie Harbor, on the West Coast. He
and six others escaped and started to walk
overland through the dense and tangled
forests, which offered scarcely anything in the
way of food. Two of the escapees turned back
and gave themselves up: the others struggled
on till their way was blocked by a river
which in their weakened condition they
could not cross. In the rage of hunger
they slew one Travers, who had hurt his foot
and could not keep up with them, and ate
him. Thus strengthened they got across
the river and pushed eastward. Soon they
grew hungry again and two other men were
killed and eaten in turn and only Pearce
and a man named Greenhill remained.
Greenhill had an axe. while Pearce was un-
armed. For two days they watched each
other, each with murder and worse in his
heart. Then Greenhill gave way and fell
asleep. The improvement in the meat supply
enabled Pearce to get through to the settled
country on the Derwent, and entitled him
to the credit of being the first man to cross
Tasmania from west to east. He stole a
sheep when he reached the open country,
was caught and sent back to Macquarie
Harbor. Again he escaped, this time 1 with
a man named Cox. They did not face the
inland forests, but worked northward along
the coast till their way was blocked bv the
Pieman River. Here Pearce killed Cox and
ate part of him and then, “desiring rather to
die than to live." as he said in his confession,
save himself up. He was banged at Hobart
Town in 1823 for the murder of Cox. Be-
fore he died he made a full confession to
his chaplain, the Rev. Connolly, and there
are few things more awful in history or in
fiction than his matter-of-fact account of
that hideous nightmare march through the
M est Coast forests. The name of the Pie-
man River preserves for all time the memory
of the cannibal pie-vendor.

Irritability, like Headache, is indisputable evidence of some
disorder of the body —generally of the nervous system. In the
majority of cases it arises from either Indigestion or Constipation.
Tonics and other treatment will be of little value unless the
cause is removed.
To accomplish this take a course of Chamberlain’s Tablets —
they have a marvellous effect on the stomach, liver and bowels.
Try them next time you feel irritable.
To stimulate the digestive organs, cleanse and invigorate the
stomach, and induce a regular habit of the bowels, nothing equals

Dr. Falliere’s Flesh-Food
to all Thin or Undeveloped Women.
ANY WOMAN without full bust development lacks the one essential that creates a perfect
appearance. Lack of proper bust development, hollow cheeks and “salt-cellars” quickly take
from a woman the bloom and freshness of healthy womanhood. Misfortune may have been
your lot in so far as natural development is concerned, but science has found a way to correct
your deficiency. Even though you have never been full-bosomed, and have been attenuated all
your life, if you suffer from no wasting disease your bosom can be fully developed and your
weight increased to normal There are, to-day, hundreds of women who were once thin,
flat-bosomed, hollow-cheeked and generally scraggy in appearance, and suffering the effects of
anremia and defective digestion, who are now, for the first time in their lives, healthy, full-
bosomed and pink-cheeked and enjoying the full vigor of robust womanhood, as the result of a
few weeks under our wonderful treatment.
Let us Send You Scores of Letters like this one!
Manager Gympie, Queensland.
Bear Sir, —As a nurse I was very interested in your Flesh-Food treatment, and was greatly sur-
prised at the wonderful results in my case. When I first wrote you I was only skin and hone, and
I have good cause to he thankful that I wrote you for a free sample, for I feel certain now that
I am one of the very best advertisements you could possibly have, as I am developed in every
way satisfactory to myself, and I have waited a good while to prove if it was lasting in its effect,
and I am now glad to say that your splendid treatment has done absolutely all you claimed it
would, my weight and measurements being ample. — I am, yours gratefully,
MRS. E. W ING ROVE.
In many cases bust measurements have been increased by over 10in., and the gain in actual
weight —equally distributed over the body in generally deficient cases —has been over five
pounds weekly. Some other cases have shown an increase in weight of even a pound a day.
The average bust increase desired is about 6in., and is readily accomplished. Guarantee given
in every case accepted.

* and development, and will send same and a SAMPLE

Our Allies know our little weaknesses.
Thus the Home -Tribune said the other day.
in discussing the Gallipoli campaign:—
It is a pertinent regret that the skill was not dis-
played until the retirement. It is an historical truth
that England loses nearly every battle except the
last.
Whicli is another way of stating that Eng-
land starts every war with a crowd of “well-
connected’’ incapables at the War Office and
in high commands, and goes muddling on
from failure to failure until the scandal
demands the introduction of new blood and
better brains. Then she wins the last battle.
This time England must pay far higher pen-
alties for her rulers’ stupidity than she has
ever paid before, because not only is the
war greater but the rulers appear also to be
exceptionally feeble.
“Trot” on camel-driving:—
A man must be careful how he uses the words
“strike.” Luckily Higgins, J., has made the mean-
ing clear. Strike means “the total or partial cessa-
tion of work by employees acting in combination as
a means of enforcing compliance with demands.”
When something else happens then a strike is not a
strike. It may be a mere knocking off of work,
it may be only a refusal to start work. In those
cases a reference to strike is offensive to the legal
ear. Unless this is recognised the greatest confu-
sion is lively to arise. As it is quite optional for
a citizen to go to work or stay at home he cannot
merely, because a number of him stay at home
simultaneously, be accused of acting in combination.
The Melbourne lumpers had refused to work for
certain wages, and the result was to tie up wheat
export. Everybody knew it was a strike. But that
is just where everybody was wrong. It wasn’t. It
was only a case of men individually not accepting
the pay. They had not combined to enforce any
demand. When they were collectively offered more
cash they individually started toil again. All of
which shows that one of the best ways of getting a
camel through the eye of a needle is to engage
Higgins, J., as driver.
Ex-Speaker Willis, who helped Labor in
the N.S.W. Assembly through the difficult
time when it couldn’t afford the risk of plac-
ing its majority in the chair, has discarded
Liberalism as a political faith. He was ad-
mitted as a member of the Gordon-Chatswood,
Political Labor League at its last meeting.
Labor law says that a man must be three
full years a member of a League before he
is entitled to selection as a political candi-
date ; but, although Willis stood as a Liberal
ac the last State elections when Abbott de-
prived him of the Upper Hunter seat, the
Labor party then gave him support, and that
may be counted unto him for righteousness.
Gordon Webber, M.L.A., the same tact-
ful young fellow who once refused to be
officially upstanding and drink the health
of George V., still has a few barrels of
tact salted down ready for use when re-
quired. The other evening, when the Rich-
mond (Vic.) Council was discussing a pro-
posal to alter the names of Berlin. Ham-
burg and Frankfort streets, Webber reached
down into his cask and brought up the fol-
lowing : “You might as well alter the names
of Heidelberg and Coburg, or even Victoria
itself. We all know that Victoria was
named after a person who was very Ger-
man A Now it would be interesting to know
by just how many generations Gordon
Webber escaped being Gottlieb Weber.
It was strange to see George Maxwell
conducting the defence for a bunch of Ben-
digo 'hotel-keepers charged last week with
breaches of the Licensing Act. They had
allegedly sold liquor to supposed soldiers dur-
ing prohibited hours-—and the supposed sol-
diers .were constables. Maxwell is a sincere
Scotcnbyterian britlier to the unco’ guid;
and it must have come as a shock to the
elect to see him trying to get the pub out of
trouble—particularly when the pub mostly
remained in. Maxwell declared that it was
“almost a prostitution of the uniform” to
use it for detecting offences ; but John Quick
countered that the prosecutions had been
launched for the protection of the soldiers,
and the Bench ordered IS out of the 20
defendants to be led out and shot forthwith
to the tune of from £2 to £5 a time. Still
there is a lot in Maxwell’s contention, especi-
ally as there is a clean alternative to such
methods of catching the publican. That
plain, simple plan is to provide wet canteens,
which will keep droughty soldiers in the
camps, instead of pushing them out to take
one drink and then fall into the hands of
harpies who are interested in selling them
forty.
Skipton, where some of Victoria’s sheepi-
est citizens have their little squattages—
Austins, Russells, Fairbairns, Chirnsides
and that sort of landlocker —is now con-
nected with civilisation- by a new railway,
most of it running handy to Mount Emu
Greek, along which are the best areas. Great
is the rejoicing from Skipton even unto
Linton, which is the old terminus; and he
who rejoicetli most is the same anti-land-
taxer and increment snatcher who of old
hath delighted to lot out one-fiftieth of his
land for share-farming and run a nice flock
on the balance, waiting the arrival of the
new railway. The first trucks went through
a few days ago.
He uses such duplicity
To draw the line,
The Grecian’s monniker should be
Inconstantine.
Frank Walford, who is carrying Labor’s
bespattered shield in Parramatta (N.S.W.)
by-election, has an excellent chance of break-
ing the old town v from Liberalism. At the
last election Walford went down in a second
ballot by only 193 against Moxham. When
not electioneering he lends a hand as part-
proprietor of the Cumberland Times (old
Jack Ferguson’s journal, which preached
Protection for a quarter-century and is nbw
a Labor paper) ; and he is progressive enough
to deserve well of the town in which his
shoulder is always up against some wheel.

THE woman who tries Bostock shoes for the first
time realises, as soon as her foot slides home,
that here is something different, something
easier and more flexible, than anything she
has yet dreamed of. Then, when she steps ont in
them', what an exultant feeling she has of lightness,
buoyancy and freedom. On the top of this, too, there
is that delightful confidence and assurance that come
of being well-dressed and knowing it. For Bostock
shoes are always designed with one eye on the
fashions of the day and one eye on the ultimate sat-
isfaction of the wearer. The result is shoes so well
fitting and so easy that they feel just like one s best-
loved old pair, yet so dainty, so original, so
thoroughly well made that they look and, after quite
a lot of wear, continue to look the newest and smart-

say : “The year has been one of the most

don't look like that; but, then, £1203 has
been paid for remodelling part of the build-
ing and a few modest hundreds have gone
to the Red Cross and other war funds. Even
so, the dividend looks a bit on the big side ;
for the co. hasn’t put so much by in the last
10 years that it can afford now to fly to
the reserves. The position of course is

As usual, this little co. is working exclu-
sively on its own money; and that means
small profits and corresponding risks. The
outstanding loans on September 30 were
£11,121, as against £12,282 twelve months
ago, which suggests that —wisely no doubt
—new business hasn’t been chased lately.
Expenses are very modest; and yet they eat
up about p.c. on the loans outstanding.

good bit before the shareholders get any-
thing but bread-and-butter —and there is
not much butter.

Butler’s Tin. Torrington (N.S.W.), a
Melbourne co. floated over 18 months ago
by the Mackay-Sutherland syndicate, has
been blocked by the long drought from test-
ing the ideas of the new owners as to treat-
ment of low-grade tin ore. Crushing and con-
centrating plant capable of treating 1500 tons
per month was ready long ago, but is still idle
for want of water. Meanwhile development
work has progressed, and it is reported that
there are now available 35,000 tons more
ore than when the mine was bought. Bai-
ling the Reid party’s success at Tent Hill,
near Emmaville, in early times, and the
partial success of the Carpathia lately,
lode tin-mining in N. S. Wales has been a
conspicuous failure; and many practical
men who speak from costly experience pre-
dict that Butler’s people are founding their
hopes on too sanguine expectations. Mechan-
ical appliances for the collection of fine tin
oxide have not reached the same state ot
perfection as machines for dealing with
other minerals. It will be noted, for ex-
ample, that neither of the Ardlethan cos.
which are treating tin ore ever condescends
to state the proportion between assay and
recovered # »
“Gee” • The hope of the Chillagoe share-
holders, the Mt. Mulligan coal mine, is likely
to prove disappointing unless the stuff im-
proves. At the Babinda mill we could not
keep the steam up with it. In four hours
the fires got chocked, and 16 barrow-loads
of ash and cinders was what we took out.
Using Newcastle coal in seven hours we took
out only 2\ barrow-loads of ash. I hey are
using Newcastle coal now. #
Little St. Mungo, Cloncurry, had another
remarkable half-year, paying four sixpenny
dividends and declaring another the whole
exceeding the total capital of £oooo. Cei-
tainly the profits of the term didn t run
quite that far; still the P. and L. account
shows £3337 to the good, and there was still
on Nov. 30 about £4OOO in hand, including
ore in transit. “Just at present, the fran '
directors say, “the mine does not look as
well as usual: but with copper at the
present price our manager expects to earn
profits and at the same time do a consider-
able amount of development work.

News of the Plymouth Consolidated, Cali-
fornia, in which the Sons of Gwalia is in-
terested, came to hand the other day. It
appears that on the October run there was
a net profit of £4375, equal—if it can be
maintained-to £50,000 per annum lwo

Boring worked as a nipper, and which altei
being waterlogged and abandoned for many
years was his report in London.
Kanowna is beginning to wonder where all
the 2oz. ore which the newly-floated Anzac
whoops about is to.come from. Successive
parties of working miners gaveJhe show a
trial after the North White Feather Co.
threw it up in despair, and the possibility
of any large quantity of stone of the value
mentioned being left behind for the Anzac
to take out is scouted. All the Anzac seems
to have done to date is to unwater the work-
ings. do a bit of sampling, and get swelled
head on the alleged discovery of a tairly
long run of high values. An independent
report from an expert of repute is needed.

WHAT a marked difference there is
between the fretful,, puny, ailing infant,
and the child whose face always bears
the smile and look of perfect health and con-
tentment. Mothers should early realize that much
depends on How Baby is Fed. The right food
given at the proper age means rest and comfort
for the mother and a sound healthy constitution

The
A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

The Man with the Donkey.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“There was a man with a donkey... .his name
was Simpson!”
UP from the beach when the sulky sun
peered over liis trenching cloud,
Threading the scrub to the inmost
hill by scattering shrapnel ploughed,
Skirting the bore of the tunnelled bank
where the sweating sappers strain,
Stooping' and lading and striding down to
the scrabbled sand again,
Gleaning and binding the broken sheaves
where the piled gun-harvest lay,
Flouting the threat of the whining shell and
the drone of the ricochet,
Swift to the jest and the back-flung word,
tireless, well-content,
Coatless and careless and long of limb, the
man with the donkey went.
Up from the beach and the scrabbled sand,
while the hammering field-guns’ wrath
Broke on the ridge and the roofed-in trench
and the ravelling cliff-side path,
Holding and hauling and toiling down the
scarp to the shoreward slope,
Tightening, clinching and throwing back on
the tautened halter-rope—
The bullets that sang in the gully-ways or
spat on the rocks below
Might carry a message one day for 'him!
What then? It was written so!
And the swaying burdens that sat astride,
and the red war-jetsam cast
Spent from the charge, took heart to pray
where the man with the donkey passed !
The bullying cannon clamored on through
the raving rifle-fire.
A shrieking whistle shrilled “Advance,” and
a bugle screamed “Retire !”
Down with his freight to the danger-belt
where the dipning beach-tracks bend.
Turning, he looked to the water-guard and
his laboring journey’s end.
Shouted a taunt to the farther 'trench—and
a shot leapt answering back.
And the man with the donkey dropped and
lay in the trash of the littered track !
The day sank drowned in the grieving sea,
and the eyes of the stars were dim.
And the last of his tally of six-score men
lay prone in the sand with him !
Vain words, and wrought in the roving
brain of a stricken man, perchance,
Are the sayings of one who holds his faith
in the scorn of Circumstance :
That, after, the shuddering cannonade had
ceased in the hills apart,
The last of the tally of six-score men, his
head on the dead man’s heart,
Saw, from the veil of the breathless night, a
half-guessed Shape that stole
Sorrowful, seated upon an ass, on a colt, an
ass’s foal,
Lingered, and looked, and went; and a
a ? e ‘ dead eyes dimly-glassed.
Shone for a second and sank again, as the
Man on the donkey passed !

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AMONG the telephone slips which
Wedderburn found on his desk when
he came back from lunch was one
which read: “1.15. J. B. Wingfield, Cali-
fornia. Wished to have your company at
lunch to-day. Booked for Melbourne. If
convenient will call 4.45 p.m.”
He puzzled for a moment; then he re-
membered the letter he had received four or
five months ago. He turned it up in his
private file and read it. Written on heavy
notepaper and embossed: “California Club,
lalm Beach. Dear Charlie,” it ran; “I may
he in Australia one of these days, and if you
haven t forgotten your old partner, would
like to drop in and see how they have been
treating you.—Yours, Jimmy.” There was a
(ami enclosed, engraved, “J. Bede-Wingfield,
snowstorm, Idaho.”
All very imposing and simple and sugges-

Hid Jimmy have any?
Mr. \\ ingfiekl, sir,” said a clerk, ushering
a middle-aged, ruddy-faced, shabbily-dressed
man into the room, discreetly withdrawing
and closing the door behind him.
A\ edderburn was surprised.
Its me all right, Charlie,” said his visi-
tor, stepping towards him, his round, chubby
cheeks and twinkling blue eyes expressing
the keenest satisfaction. “How are you?”
• ')[ G dderburn was indignant. Wingfield was
jubilant. He sat down in the visitor’s chair,
ran his fingers through his tangle of grey
hair and beamed with delight on his old
partner.
“Say,” he remarked, sizing up the sur-
roundings, “you’ve done yourself very well
since I drew my stakes.”
W edderburn gripped the arms of his chair,
set his teeth and frowned ominously. Wing-
field genially crossed his arms on his broad
chest.
“Charlie,” he challenged, “aren’t you sur-
prised to see me?”
‘‘l certainly am surprised to see Mr. Bede-
Wingfield, of Snowstorm, Idaho, and Palm
Beach, in no better case than I see you.”
Jimmy laughed uproariously.
“Oh, that was a cinch. I thought it would
get you. It was the Snowstorm guy you
wanted. Ah, Charlie, that always was your
weak point. Swank, style, no end of dog.
and, if a man had a couple of hundred dollars
more than you, you’d lick his boots.”
“If in addition to deceiving me”
“Deceive nothin’. Not once. You deceive
yourself.”
“Writing from the California Club”
“I was staying there at the time. Sure
thing, Charlie. Washin’ autos, at five dol-
lars per and found. J. Bede-Wingfield took
a shine to me because I shone his gasoline
buggy. The yard thought it a great joke
his name and mine being practically the
same. All but the Bede. J. Bede-Wingfield’s
automobile in five minutes set everybody
grinning when J. Wingfield—me—hustled up
and rubbed her over. One of the page-boys
swiped a card of Wingy’s for me special.
The club paper was easy. Betcher stuck it
up oVer your desk, Charlie, and bragged about
it to your wife. You’ve got a wife, I guess.
You’re the sort of chap who marries—for
business and other reasons. Well, you
wouldn’t be happy without it, would you,
Charlie? And I’m glad to see that you’ve
got all you went for.”
Charlie’s frown deepened.
“You don’t seem over-glad. Say. you don’t
mind me dropping in on you like this, but I
couldn’t help it. When I wrote that letter
I had no more idea of coming to Australia
than I had of going to the moon. The gink
who had bought the concession for dolling
up the buzz-waggons made us turn our tips
in to him twice a day, but now and then we
beat him to it, and when I had been three
months on the job I had eighty iron men in
cold storage. Twenty of them I got in one
bunch from my namesake the day he left. I
dug up my balance and headed for the hori-
zon. Blew into Vancouver a bit to the good,
and picked up a friend on the water-front.
A greaser on the Minnesota. Was on board
just before she cast off. when my friend got a
crack on the head with a winch-block. It
was him for the morgue, and I
took on his job. We got in here a week ago.
I have shore-leave till midnight. Day after
to-morrow we sail for Melbourne, and this
being the onlv hope I had of seeing you
before Gabriel' toots, I took the liberty.”
“And now what do you want?”
“Does nobody ever come to see you unless
they hope to skin you for a dollar t ’
Wedderburn winced.
“I don’t want nothin’, Charlie; not a
thing. They gave me ten dollars when I
came ashore, I have nine of them left. I’ve
been round and had a look at the old store ,
it’s still there, though they’ve built all round
it Seed-merchant’s place now; Hines and
Brown. Well, well; glad to see you looking
so fit. I’ll have to be hustling. Your little
wife and kids’ll be waiting dinner for you.
You’ve got kids, haven’t you, Charlie?
Charlie nodded.
“That’s right. When a man gets to our
age kids must be a great comfort. And a
responsibility. At the same time there s a
certain satisfaction in carrying out our re-
sponsibilities. ‘Holy pleasure servin’ those
we love,’ even if it*s only giving the glad
hand to suffering humanity. Well, good-
bye. Charlie, and if ever your petrol-’bus
needs overhauling I’ll be proud to give you
the benefit of my three months’ experience
at Palm Beach.’
With outstretched hand, Jimmy was on
his feet ready to go.
Wedderburn pressed a button on his desk.
The clerk entered.
“Is the revise of the balance-sheet back
from the printer?”
“Yes, sir ; shall I bring”
“No. Is everybody gone but you?”
“Mr. Solis is still here.”
“Let him attend to it; then you can both
go. Good night.”
The clerk thanked him and gave a “Good
night” that embraced everybody. Wedder-
burn nodded curtly, but Jimmy replied with
a nod and a wink and a smile that rocked
the clerk’s boat. Wedderburn drew a box
of cigars from his desk and passed it to
Jimmy. “Sit down,” he said.
They lay back in their chairs and smoked
silently.

SKIN
TRODBLES.
SUNBURN, BUSTERS, PRICKLY HEAT, SMARTING
PATCHES, INSECT BITES, ITCH 8 KINDRED SKIN
TROUBLES PROMPTLY HEALED BY ZAM-BUK.
IN summer the skin is made tender by
excessive perspiration ; and the badness
imprisoned in the tissue, owing to the
sluggishness of the pores, is drawn out in
the form of pimples, rashes and heatswellings.
The strong air of the country or the seaside
does not always suit the skin of the town
dweller, while a change of water frequently
induces a burning irritation and rash that is
even more discomforting than sunburnt and
peeling arms and face, because this irritation
provokes rubbing and scratching, which opens
the way for eczema or some poisoned sore.
The best check to these skin troubles is the
regular use of Zam = Buk, which is a pure skin balm.
For removing that tingling irritation known as
Summer Itch, or Prickly Heat, Zam = Buk is invaluable.
Zam-Buk is also highly recommended for taking the sting and smarting
out of insect bites, for it not only soothes pain, but counteracts any
poison that may have been introduced into the system.
Zam-Buk has achieved a world-wide reputation for purity and
effectiveness.
EVERY HOME NEEDS ZAM-BUK.
SUMMER RASH.
Mrs. L. Switzer, of Ethel Street, For-
restville, Adelaide, says: “Overheating of
the blood caused a -nasty rash to break
out at different periods on the back of
my neck. This was very irritable, and it
was a matter of difficulty to keep my
hands from. it. My mother, who always
used Zam-Buk in the home, recommended
me to try this halm. I did so, and in a
short time the rash was completely
ended.
“My sister has also been cured of skin
eruptions by Zam-Buk.”
SUNBURN CAUSED BLISTERS.
Mrs. A. Lamplough, of High Street,
Chelmer Hill, Mount Morgan (Q.), says:
“One ilav during the holidays my boy,
who had been swimming, complained of
a nasty pain on his back and shoulders.
On examining him I found that the sun
had burnt him so badly that the skin was
hanging in water blisters, and the poor
lad could not bear the weight of his
clothes on him. After picking the blisters
1 applied Zam-Buk all over his back, and
in a week the smarting and soreness had
quite gone away.”
For all Summer Skin Troubles, as well as the minor everyday
accidents that happen in every home, Zam-Buk is Invaluable.

“What are you going to do to-night?”
asked Wedderburn about half-way through
i lie cigar.
“Hunt up some joint where I can get a
good meal in spite of these dusty duds of
mine. Fill my pipe and get on the observa-
tion end of a tram. Out to Bondi most
likely, where I used to board. I like looking
at the old spots. Then ramble along George-
street and have a look at the young people
and a pint in some of the old pubs—if there
are any of them left. Is the Alhambra still
running?”
Charlie said lie thought it was a picture
show.
“Ah! Do you remember when Fred Ilis-
eocks was at the Alhambra —Hiseocks’ Fed-
eral Minstrels. Is he still about?”
Charlie hadn’t heard of him for years.
“Dead. I suppose. George Rignold’s dead.
Heard that in Chicago. Well, common lot.
of course: but you and I are alive and
worth a dozen of the best dead ’uns ever.
But I'm keepin’ you. •Good-bye, Charlie,
and I’m damned glad to have seen you
again.”
“Are you damned glad enough to come
and have dinner with me?” asked Wedder-
burn. biting bard on his cigar.
“Good old Charlie!” said Jimmy delight-
edly. “But it would never do. I’m not
dressed for the part. Still, I’m glad you
said it. old man, and let it go at that.”
"No need to if you aren't too proud to
wear a spare suit of mine. Not that I give
a curse how you are dressed, but I’d like
to take you round to the Club and have a
yarn about old times. You know, Jimmy,
that rig-out would make you feel more un-
comfortable than it would me.”
There was no foolish pride about Jimmy.
He made a selection from Charlie’s spare
wardrobe, and the men being much of a size
he was fitted very well. They walked to
the Club. There were few men there, and
they got a table to themselves. Between
dishes Jimmy gave a rapid sketch of his
brilliant career since Charlie had bought
him out.
Kimberley didn’t hold him long, nor
Broken Hill, but he went north and stayed a
year around the Territory before he drifted
across to the Islands. Pie had a great time
there, trading and loafing and loafing and
trading. Met Stevenson at Samoa; a lot
of the dialogue in “Ebb Tide” was garnered
from Jimmy Wingfield. A schooner took
him to Singapore; from there he went to
China, and in five years he had got as far
as rekin. Japan was next: across to
America was only a step, and there was
scarcely a State in the Union where the
Bird o’ Freedom and Jimmy hadn’t howled
in harmony.
“How do you live?”
Jimmy crossed himself. “The good God
provides for the ravens, and am I less than
a raven in His sight?”
“Ever think of settling downasked
Charlie, as they started on their second
bottle of champagne.
“Not knowingly. Once I set up a sort
of a home in Burma, but it wasn’t a success.
I've, had a free leg pretty nearly all the
time. Now, I have good health, nine dollars,
a swell suit of clothes and a good conscience.
There’s lots of men haven't got all that at
fifty-three. What have you got. Charlie?”
Charlie muttered that he had a fine busi-
ness.
Jimmy laughed. Charlie protested.
He swore that it was a damn fine busi-
ness and paid seven and a half per cent, on
a turnover of eighty thousand pounds.
“Seven and a half per cent.,” derided
Jimmy. “Why, I get seven and a half hun-
dred per cent, on a turnover of nothing at
all. Can you beat that, Charlie?”
They finished the bottle and went up on
the roof garden.
“By gosh ! Sydney is some city for scenics,”
said Jimmy, as he watched the ferry boats
gliding on the harbor like great fireflies.
“If we had a burg like this in the States
we’d yelp ourselves hoarse about it three
times a day.”
“Damn Sydney!” said Charlie. “Let’s
have another bottle.”
Jimmy laughed. “So long as your head
can stand it I know your pocket can: but
I’m not used to it, and there’s the Minne-
sota's engines to be greased at four in the
morning.”
Charlie filled both the glasses up to the
brim.
"So you have enjoyed yourself?”
“Every minute of it. ’ If it was all to
go through again I’d say, ‘Right! Here
stands Jimmy Wingfield.’ Same as you
would, Charlie, if it was put up to you.”
“How do you know what I would do?”
"I can read you like a book. You think
you have a fine business. Not a bit of it.
The fine business has you. You could no
more break away from it than I could”
“Help getting up at four in the morning to
grease marine engines.”
“I could help that quite easy.” said
Jimmy. “Though I have six weeks’ wages
coming to me I have half a mind to cut
away over the Mountains and see what it
is like on the other side. I’ve never been
on the Lachlan. I've never seen the Dar-
ling River. I heard a man recite ‘Clancy
of the Overflow’ at Winnipeg, and ever
since then the West has had a big attraction
for me. So if you don’t mind. Charlie, we’ll
toddle back to your office. I’ll get into my
old duds and make a break for the Plains.”
"Do you always rush off like that?”
“Always. I’m a free nigger.”
“Make it a pair. Take me with you!”
"Charlie, it's the champagne!”
"Not a bit of it. I'm sick of this life.
You were quite right. Jimmj, about the
business. It had me. But it hasn’t now.
Tt can go to Hell. I’m going with you.
There’s enough for the wife and kids. Finish
the bottle. Jimmy. It’s Wedderburn and
Wingfield once more.”
Jimmy laughed.
It struck ten as they boarded a tram for
the railway. They got out at Penrith just
before midnight.
"No hotel for us.” said Jimmy. “It’s as
mild as an eve in Paradise. Let’s pick a
nice spot under a tree and get up in time
~t' > .'ii the-otß-tist”
Charlie stumbled after him through the
dark, and just beyond the town Jimmy
picked a camp. He showed him how to
tuck his pants into his socks, scoop a hole
for his hipbone, make a pillow of his coat
and smoke himself to sleep.
Jimmy sang a verse of “This is the Life”
for his evening devotions, knocked the ashes
from his pipe and slipped off to the Land of
Dreams.
Charlie couldn’t follow him. The pass-
ing trains kept him awake. So did the
mosquitoes. Jimmy slept like a new-born
babe until the twitter of birds w T oke him up
at dawn.
Charlie was already gone.
A knotted handkerchief lay by Jimmy’s
head. In it was a handful of small change,
two ten-pound notes and a couple of sover-
eigns. Also a leaf torn from a memoran-
dum book. Written on it in indelible pencil
was: “You were right, Jimmy; the business
has got me.”
Jimmy laughed, pocketed the money, put
on his coat and set out for the Mountains
whose tops were already rosy with the
promise of day.

m V for da stomach saka,’ eh? I
believa heem no more!”
Pedro Daubetto was a tired man, mentally
and physically. A brilliant Italian artist,
six months before he had stood at the home
quay-side and told the dark-eyed, olive-
skinned girl that in a little time he would
come back “Wid-a plenty da mon!” and
make her his wife. Overnight, in this far-
out Australian land, he had had a weird ex-
perience, and his heart was heavy and sad
his thoughts.
“Always da Eenglische knowa da rope,” he
murmured. “You cheera me up? I tella da
tale o’ my life. Oh,.Santa Marie!” he began,
“whad eet iss I della you—my troub’; a
vera greata troub'. Lasa night I am alone
in-a my studeeo, where I painta da pic’ (oh, so
lovely da pic’!), I thinka of my sweeta leetle
girl in Eetaly. ‘Soona Pedro,’ I makea da
speaka, you getta da mooch mon, and makea
da break —da skiddadle. Eetaly again, da
lova kees, and da wine. So happy I am.
when, by Cripa, I heera da strange noises.
A knock at my door. ‘Who eet is?’ I com-
mandment, and a lowa voice speaka back,
“Shorge, the dirta-box man.’ Then ona my
stair I heer da groan—mora groan—an’ my
door spilla open, and in walka Snorge, the
man who makea da collex’ da dirta-box.
“ ‘Pedro.’ he aska me, ‘I vera sicka man.
For da lova. Saint Fa trice, you givea me-
bigga drink.’ ‘Yes,’ I makea da bold reply,
‘dis’a all right for you, but you must not
break my res’. I ama da vera sleep’ man.
But I givea you somea wine.’ He drinka da
wine, and what you guess lieem? No! By
da Santa Mick Angelo, he falla dead in my
stud’ where I makea da lovely pic’. I am
vera scared man. No likea to see da ghost,
so I rush downstairs and makea mooch noise
and raisa da Hell. I)a watchfellow he is
trying, da door, and I tell.a da tale. Yera
wise he looka, I bet you, likea da beak, and
he say .to me:
“ ‘Disa vera bad biz. Peclro. Dirta-box
man cornea to youra place a vera sika man;
he aska you a piek-a-me-down, and. by
Cripa, when you givea heem da pick-a-me-
down he droppa dead. Now I wanta know
whata you havea Tn da bot s ?’
“I givea heem da bot’, and he makea da
cheenk wida da glass. ‘Notta bad wine,’ he
say. ‘I think a notta da wine killa heem,
but I calla da pleece.’
“In fivea min’ in walka da cop. He looka
vera wise, too. ‘I feela vera sorry for you.’
he say. ‘But disa vera bada case. A man
feela vera sicka man; he aska you givea
him da drink. You say, ‘Rye buck, givea
da drink,’ an’ he droppa dead. Notta look
too good for you. I wanta know whata you
hava in-a da bot’.’
“ ‘Strika me pinka,’ I tell him. ‘I on'a
givea da wine and I passa da hot’. He makea
da cheenk wida da glass, an’ I heer da wine
washa da Adam apple in da t’roata.
“ ‘Yera good wine,’ he say; ‘notta da wine
killa heem. but I ringa da sarj’.’
“By Saint Pedro, in coma da sarj’. ‘Disa
vera bada biz.’ he say. ‘Sicka man aska you
for drink, an’ s’helpa da cat, he getta da
drink an’ droppa dead. You must showa
me da wine.’ ‘Firsta bot’ alia gone.’ I say. ‘I
mus’ open nexa one?’ I aska heem. ‘Asa
you say,’ he response. Oricea mora da
cheenk. oncea mora da apple getta da wash,
and gooda-bye ma wine. Da sarj’ licka da
lip. ‘Yera gooda da wine.’ he say. 'P'raps
notta da drink kill heem. But I bedda ringa
da sub-inspec’.’
“Arriva da sub. By Cripa, he scara me,
too. Plenta braid and stripa. He vera wise,
until he spotta da bod’. ‘Yery serious dis-a
biz.’ he say. A sicka man cornea to youra
place. You givea da strong drink, he droppa
dead. I mus’ see whata you givea da man.
Bigga tanka da sub. He drinka ona. two.
dree, fiva da wine and smaeka da lip. He
speaka hees piece, too. ‘Yera gooda da wine,
and, by da Madon’, I knowa when da wine
ees good, an’ when da fivea beana makea
seven, butta notta da wine killa heem. Still
I ringa da Cor’ —dis-a fellow who finda whv
he die.’
“Woulda you believa me?. Da Cor’ he da
on’a man havea da sense. I heara on da
’phone, too. ‘Man droppa dead at Dago
paint-shop.’ say da sarj. ‘Wella.’ say da
Cor’, ‘you keep heem. I wanta sleepa som'.
and to-morrer willa be Frid’.’
“An’ da sub-inspec’ say. ‘Brinsra da wine
and we fin’ da cause of da deadness datta
way. So they all leava me—taka my wine.
I heara vera mooeha noises stampa da stair-
way as da crowd vamoosa. and I calla out:
‘Sarj’, who mova da bod’?’ He say. ‘Or-
righ’, don' losa da block —he can’t drinka da
wine. You keepa heem.’
So I turn to da dedda man. He makea
big eye, like he looka through my roof at da
star. I speaka to hem.
“ ‘Shorge,’ I maka repeat. 'Da nexa time
you wanta die you keepa dis-a place awav.
You go an’ droppa dead in d-i - ine BodeegY ”

It should always be remembered that what appear compar-

way of developing into very grave troubles. Such derange-
