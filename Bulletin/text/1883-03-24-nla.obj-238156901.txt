England's Greatness.
EVBttT child is familiar with the touching, al-
though faintly imbecile, narrative, in which Her
Maj;sty the Queen, having granted an interview
to some savage person who had been taken round
the dockyards and shown tee national stores of
murdering-maohines, was asked by the deeply-
impressed Hottentot, or whatever ha was, ‘ What
is the secret of England’s greatness ? ’ Now it is
well known to every well informed—American,
that the Queen of England lives in the Tower of
London, and on all state occasions has a largo
Bible held, ready for occasional reference, by the
Lord Chancellor. On being asfeed this question,
therefore, Her Majesty, without a moment’s hesi-
tation such as so comprehensive a question might
have occasioned to a person of inferior mind, such
as Gibbon or Buckle, clapped her hand on the
State Bible and sai i, ” This is the secret of Eng-
land a greatness.” Without troubling about the
sequel—how the savage person reverentially fell
upon hla knees before the Book and begged to bo
placed in possession of it, with the intention of
putting it upon a high post when he git back to
his own country and sticking feathers in it, and
sacrificing fifty children in its honour at every full
moon —we may proceed to state that an ingenious
person named A. J. Wilson has, in a recent
numoer of Macmillan's Maoazinb, offered
quite a distinct explanation of “ The secret of
England’s greatness.”
* • *
Mr. Wilson’s text is a sentence in the Queen’s
speech—not to the Hottentot, but to Parliament
at the prorogation on 2nd December last. “ 1 he
growth of the revenue,” said Her Majesty, “is
sensibly retarded by a cause which must in itself
be contemplated with satisfaction. I refer to the
diminution of the receipts of the Exchequer from
the duties on intoxicating liquors.” Mr. Wilson
is seriously concerned at this utterance. Ho
would have wished that Her Majesty had taken
an intelligent view of the situation, and majesti-
cally calling from her suite the Chancellor of the
Exchequer with a rum bottle, have gracefully
placed her hand upon that vessel and remarked,
“ This is the secret of England's greatness—and
I regret to observe that it is not so generally
esteemed as in former years.” “ Surely,” ex-
claims Mr. Wilson, “ it is a grave and startling
fact that a Chancellor of the Exchequer should
be disposed to look with equanimity upon the
diminution of a source of income such as this ! ”
He goes on to remark mournfully that if the
nation is in truth becoming sober, the prospect
opened up for it seems the dreariest in the world.
And really Mr. Wilson makes out a very strong
case. Taking the year 1881 as a test, he shows
that the total revenue of tne United Kingdom
from all sources amounted to =870,580,000. Of
this, no less than .£31,038,000 was derived from
‘‘drink taxes.” The revenue from intoxicants
was, therefore, 44 per cent, of the whole income
of the nation. This proportion suffices to defray
the entire ordinary charges of the at my and navy,
and still leaves a balance of more than a million
sterling in excess of what is spent on educational
purposes in “ this great and enlightened country.”
Nothing of a like kind has been obtained from
■any other taxes or system of taxes, and this is
4h9 great prop of Government, the source whence
the coat of so many pomps and glories are de-
frayed. In other words, if Her Majesty had not the
grog-bottle in the back ground, she would not be
able to afford to keep up the expense of the State-
Bible in the foreground. Or, to put the case
differently, whijp the Bible is the ostensible, the
grog-bottle is the real, Secret of England a great-
ness !
• • 9
The success of teetotalism would thus, accord-
ing to Mr. Wilson, dissolve the national great-
ness. It would reduce the Exchequer to bank-
ruptcy, It would involve the country in a
dilemma of which one horn would mean ths
disbandment of the army and the break up of the
navy, and the other would necessitate stoppage
ot payment on the public debt. These would be
the direct effects. But the secondary results
would be still more formidable. The same diffi-
culty which, according to many prophets, will
■embarrass our local Government, in consequence
of the surrender ot the revenue from land sa'es by
unction, wouldrneet the rulers of the Empire were
they to be deprived of the income derived from the
prevalence of drinking habits. They would be put
to ifc to find fresh sources of revenue which would
not involve greater evils than were attached to
that which they abandoned. According to Mr.
Wilson, the Imperial Government could not
possibly discover any which would be free from
such objections. In his opinion, the whole social
• e ° nt,n ?y might be upset in the frantic efforts of
Administrations to find ways and means to take
the place of the vanished drink income. Land-
owners would be dispossessed of their property,
struggling traders and middlc-clsss people be
stripped of a tenth part ot their income, and still
the vgid be Those are mild de iuctions com-
pared with what might be drawn if Mr. Wilson’s
premises be true. Under snob a strain, the con-
stitution would necessarily give way, the throno
would crumble, anarchy would be rampant, and
England’s pheo among the nations know her no
more ! And all because some people declined to
continue drunkards, and others ceased or mode-
rated their consumption of intoxieating liquors !
“The drinkers— moderate and otherwise— nave”
(we quote Mr. Wilson's own words) “found our
Kings and Ministers the means to build up a
resplendant Empire.” And he plainly intimates
th*t we shall have to give up that Empire “ should
we become a sober people.”
• # •
Is this, then, the secret ot England’s past great-
ness P Drink? Not the Bible. Is it true that
the terrific wars we have waged in virtue’s cause
have only been brought to triumphant issue
because wa possessed the sinews of war, derived
from drink ? Has our national strength to give
force to our national undertakings been propor-
tionate to our national vice? Is vice, then, a
minister to glory and to greatness? Hero, indeed,
is food for reflection. The paradox demands in-
vestigation. It cannot bo logically true. Thera
must bo a flaw. There are throe propositions
involved. First, that our country has been great.
Second, that it has derived’its strength from its
drink revenue. And, third, that its greatness haa
been due to its strength. Wo will examine the
last proposition first. The greatness of our coun-
try has been duo to our strength. This seems
true. Our national greatness cannot be attributed
to our national virtues. The people of Norway
and Sweden, of Denmark, and of Holland —to
quota but a few instances —are as virtuous as onr
own. But those nations are not great. They are
less great than our nation in the exact dogree that
they are ksa strong—in population and in wealth.
Then greatness is duo to ssrength, and the terras
are convertible. Addressing ourselves next to
the second proposition, that our country derives
its strength from its drink-revenue, there seems
no way of escape. One-third of our revenue is
derived from drink. Deprived o£ that proportion,
the ordinary machinery of Government would bo
paralysed—that is to say, brought to tho extremity
of weakness. Then our country has deiived its
strength from its drink-revenue. And we have
ascertained that, in this matter, strength and
greatness are convertible terms. We have only
to substitute one for the ot!f$ to clinch this pro-
position, viz , onr country has derived its great-
ness from its drink-revenue. There only remains
the first proposition. Our country has been great.
She has been great, and it has boon due to her
strength, alias her liquor income. Which is
ridiculous. Vice can never make a man or a
country truly great.
• • •
The key to the enigma is to be found in the
corruption of the moaning attached to the word
“great.” The greatness of the Empire in the
past has signified nothing different from the great-
ness of ALEXANDER, Or (JACSAB, or Frederick,
or Napoleon —a greatness derived from a largo
development of the aggressive qualities—a great-
ness which is born of force and nurtured by fraud.
This is not true greatness. There is no true
greatness but greatness cf soul, and in that puro
sense a little handful of men in an obscure corner
of the earth may constitute a nation whose great-
ness outshines all the splendours cf Rome, and
obliterates all the glories of the first French Em-
pire. There was a time when Greece, with the
population of a modern English county, was
almost great. There have been epochs when our
own land has touched greatness. But it was
never nearer greatness than it was* a few years
ago. Mr. Gladstone has been the Minister, and
Victoria the Sovereign, who have raised England
a step out of the degrading greatness which ex-
isted by virtue of its grog-account. Greatness is
inseparable from magnanimity. The highest
points of England’s past greatness were reached
when she preferred an arbitration to a war
— the Geneva Arbitration — and when de-
feated, and stung with humiliation, she con-
ceded to the Boers the independence she should
never have denied to them. She suffered a shame-
ful relapse, it is true, when she lent her liquor-
stimulated to crush, on behalf of
money-lenders, the national aspirations of the
Egyptian people. She was never smaller than
when crowned with the “glories” of Alexandria
and Tel-el-Kebir, But she is advancing towards
greatness. The principles which Gladstone has,
more than all other men, been instrumental in
inculcating in theory, and has so sadly violated in
recent practice—the principles of true Liberalism
and high national magnanimity—have struck
root, and will flourish apace as their tendrils pene-
trated the ever-widening fissures in the rocky soil
of false sentiment and class-selfishness. One day
our country will show that she dare be magnani
mous, even to Ireland, and, casting coercion and
oppression on one side, tell Ireland to work out
her own destiny. Nothin® so humiliates a true
Briton as the argument that Ireland must be
throttled to all time, because we dare not face her
as a possible enemy on our borders. The true
Briton dare, and by plucking the nettle danger
would gain the blossom safety. The magnanimity
whioh gave freedom to Ireland would go far ta
convert hatred into friendship.
• a •
But Mr. Wilson insists that even ma-
terial greatness cannot bo preserved unless
supported in the case of Great Britain by a
standard of booze. He is peremptory on the
point. “ Beformers may say,” he remarks, “ that
the nation could bear many taxes, did it not spend
two and a half times the national revenue in
drink.” He does not condescend to argue the
point. He dismisses it with a decisive declaration,
in italics, that, “ this is a fallacy," and troubles
himself no more about it, beyond alleging that it
is _ folly to assume that the money not spent in
drink would bo money saved, for there are a
thousand and one\waya wherein a man can bo
extravagant drinking. Upon this lost
contention the whole of Mr. Wilson’s argument,
as to the impossibility of a nation being groat if
it became sober, hinges. The argument is rotten
to the core. A sober nation would save in internal
expenses almost as much as would suffice to main-
tain its army and navy. Its gaols and police
would dwindle to insignificance. Its criminal
courts would shrivel to a mere particle of
their present proportions. The productive in-
dustry of the people who manufacture, who
deal in, and who destroy themselves by
excess with intoxicants would be diverted to
industry truly beneficial and productive. It is
difficult even to conceive the extent to whioh the
material advancement of any country which
manufactured its drunkards and tipplers into
steady and temperate men would attain. And the
quickening of the moral sense of such a nation
would be not less sensible. The prevalence of an
inebriated minority infects the whole mass of
society, and retards the march of humanitarian
and enlightened perceptions. In spite of Mr.
Wilson’s ax-catlwdra declarations, we hold the
conviction that not only would a nation, whioh did
not consume intoxicants to the extent of two
hundred millions sterling every year, surpass all
knowledge in true greatness, but that its sinews
of war, the basis of physical power and false
greatness, would be equally enhanced. In other
words, we believe that sober England could hold
in the hollow of her hand and crush with scarcely
an effort a score of Englands which relied for
greatness upon a liquor income.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Sedition and Treason.
Mors ‘’sedition and treason.” Lord Charms BEM0-
ford— the Charley Beresford of the Prince of Wales*
set, and the gallant commander of the gunboat which,
at the bombardment of Alexandria did the only dashing
work of that one-sided engagement—has written to tho
Times a Bulletin article about Arabi Bbt. Ho
summarises, as we did, and in the same candid spirit,
the events which led up to the war with the Egyptians,
and continues; “ Where was England’s justification for
the late military operations in Egypt P—-operatic**
which many think were undertaken against a party
who were merely agitating for reforms, the necessity
for which is allowed on all sides. Can the justification
be that it was necessary to continue the policy in-
angurated by the late Government, which aimed at
securing a stronger hold of the Sues Canal P If so,
why did not England put this forward as her reason for
hostilities, instead of stating that she was only
quelling a rebellion, tho causes of which she did
not pause to fairly inquire into P If tho late hos-
tilities were not undertaken to support tho
policy referred to, it must surely bo thought that,
without sufficient cause, England drifted intoa war as
arbitrary as unnecessary." Wo get tho quotation from
the S. M. Herald, which evidently thought it pub
fished an antidote to these generous sentiments by
appending comments on Lord Charles’ expression of
opinion by the London Figaro, which observes To
say the least of it, it was indiscreet. Not that he has
not a right to possess his personal opinion as to the
advisability of the Egyptian war, but certainly it would
have been better had the commander of H M. gunboat
Condor refrained from insinuating that the whole ®f
our interference in Egypt has been a mistake; that is
the views my Lords take of it,'according to report. If
it is becoming for Lord Charles Beresford to criticise
in the papers the war he helped so plackily to wage*
it is clear that every other naval officer engaged
at Alexandria may undertake the same functions.
Imagine the result of nil of them writing in a
similar strain to tho Times on the some day.”
The Herald probably regards this as a clincher for Lord
Charles. Wo don’t. We comply with tho Figaro's
suggestion, end we proceed ro imagine the result of

cal with Lord Charles. What then? The deluge?
Not a bit of it. Merely that the Gov< rnment of the
United Kingdom would think a good many times before
it hurried the nation into a war which outraged all tho
moral principles which it bus been the noble distinction
of Britons to claim, as furnishing i he springs of their
national actions, and against which the very officers
engaged won’d protest. Lord Charles Beresford
declares in his letter that the National movement in
Egypt, of which Arabi Bey wia the chief, had the
sympathy of mmy officers of the invading force, as it
had the sympathy of the Egyptian people. It is in-
spiriting to discover that there are Bayards in om
armies whose souls are as generous and their inteTi-
gence as keen as their courage is danntle s Our miser-
able local dailies held forth all throu'h the Egyptian
troubles, as if no man could bo a true Englishman who
was not insensible to justice, and who was not prepared
to extenuate oppression aud crime, provided the lie*
were told and the crimes committed in the name of a
nation which hates both when it is cool enough to
distinguish them.
Hedmond, the Murderer.
Since the Evening News announced, under the head
ing of “ALARMING RUMOUR,” that the Land
Leaguers had got at the electric cable, and cut it—near
Banjowangie In tbe Malay Peninsula—in order to
intercept news which would injuriously affect the
Redmond mission in Australia, and which these despe-
radoes have so effectually intercepted that all the news
sines received has distinctly tended to show the non-
complicity of the Land League leaders with the out-
rages, and the clear distinction between Land Leaguers
and Fenians, we have noticed nothing so significint as
the murder of the Chinese doctor at Armidalo. That
this should have occurred simultaneously with the pre-
sence of the Redmonds in our colony must strike every
lunatic who has studied frem the daily papers tho art
of establishing connections between incidents, as being
fr ghtfully significant . It is important to note also
that J. E Redmond, speaking at Botany after the
murder had occurred, expressed no regret, and
offered no explanation Under tho circumstances,
every infatuated idfot wiT agree that ho has
failed to clear himself of complicity in an out.
rage which throws an indelible stain upon his
advocacy of agrarian reform, and is a disgrace to the
country in which such things occur Every fool will
now perceive the force of the Herald’s regrets that
there is no Coercion Act in this colony. Had wo but
a noblo enactment of that nature there would he no
difficulty in arrosti g Mr. Redmond, aud throwing him
into gaol on suspicion of having had something to do
with the foul murder of this Chinaman. It is true
that there is no proof that he murdered the Chinaman,
and that tho probabilities are that he is on the whole
opposed to tbe butchery of Chinese doctors, but that
is mere quibbling, and, as Sir Henry Parkes nobly
observed at the Orange meeting in tho Protestant Hall
“ all the ingenuity, and all the sophistry, could not, by
any possibility free the Land League from complicity
in the murder .”
A Word in Time.
The Government has shown such wonderful com-
plaisance in fathering the expensive fellies of its prede-
cessors with respect to the Wolverene, that there is
room for apprehension lost it may advancs a stop
further in the fame direction. Having accepted the
responsibility of perpetuating a lolly because it had
be,n accomplished, it may proceed to complete another
because it was commenced. The exohango of the public
property at Dawes Point tor sundry fragments et land
scattered through the colony was mooted some time
ago. A residence for an Admiral was required, and a
site lor a navy-yard. The party chiffly concerned, the
Naval Officer in command on the station, fixed his as"
pirationa upon Dawes Point as on agreeable and
convenient place for a residence. So no donht it
would be. Bnt it would bo agreeable and con-
venient in twenty-fold ns a connecting front-
age for tho commercial whirvos of this city. To
surrender it, would be to d'slooato the mercantile con-
veniences of the pert of Sydney. Diwos Point is a
reserve for tho people. If it be withdrawn at all from
their et Joy merit, equivalent advantage should be
accorded to them. Part of the negotiation was to
accept Garden Island as a partial equivalent. This
absurdity was not too great for tho late Ministry to
approve. Perhaps it will not be too great for their
meekly imitative successors. The idea of making a
navy-yard at Dawes Point is too transparent a sham to
veil the real desire—a site whore the Admiral might
command a view of his ships, and bo handy to the
block and the theatres. Tho situation is tho
most exposed of any inside the Heads. It is
liable to be shelled from without them. Aud,
were tho first lino of harbour defences forced,
it would have to feel tho full brunt cf p.n
enemy’s fire. There are plenty of sites infl-
nifcely to bo preferred, farther up the harbour,
where a navy-yard could be established which
would really bo out of an enemy’s range or reach. But
these would rot lo so convenient for the Admiral. It
will be a betrayal of trust if tho Government again
follow tho liokex»ittlo example of their predecessors and
sacrifice at one stroke the future convenience of the
port, the interests of the population, and the efficient
shelter of naval stores and convenienoeo, simply to
ingratiate themselves with Imperial offioers, who want
a good thing. If Dawes Point is to be surrendered to
aooommodate an Admiral, it will be but one step
further to hand ever tha Domain for quarters to a
General.
Mr. Redmond and His Critics.
An uno mpromising correspondent addresses ub on
the above subject in the plainest of plain English a a
follows “UncUr this heading yon mu«t have aston-
ished a 1 irgo proportion of your readers. Any man who
taken The Bulletin, andia not posftensed of a bob-tii iled
memory, will r-n'ol'eob thn mauly attitude assumed by
you during the recent elections in NSW, Yon thou
very properly, and in scathing language, denounced tho
introduction of foreign bickerings, hatreds, and politics,
into this country. Who, then, is this young bark you
Lave suddenly taken under your wing ? He is none of
ns, and his politics are certainly not Australian.
The ironical Bulletin is a grand paper j it baa done, is
doing, vast good, and I hope and believe it will contlnne
to feulesaly farther those true interests of the people of
Australia. Bat with all the splendid sebre.trusts of your
sarcasm, with all your great influence), yon will utterly
fail to convince Australians, who are not Irish, that
this Home-Enle bummer and his nation entertain any
other sentiment than undying hatred and animosity to
Englishmen and their descendants. We, who have
followed the goldfields in this and other lands, knew
hotter than that. I have seen with my own eyes, and
no doubt other men could corroborate me, a helpless,
inoffensive man brutally booted to death by cowardly
harks for no other reason than that he was an English-
man. When they are in the ascendant they are simply
intolerable; as the employers of labour, the biggest
cyrants under heaven, employing none but Irish, except
vhen necessity is their master, and they want skilled
labour. Whoa oiroumstances require it they can bottle
up their bile, and become the most servile crawlers on
this or »ny other continent. You say the Radicals cf
England sympathise with their struggles. I think you
"reckon without your host ” there, old men, consider-
ing the conduct of tho Irish bigots in tha House o'
Commons toward* the courageous Bradlangh, when
lighting for the right Northampton had conferred upon
him. Between the true progressive Radicals of England,
-■iurope, and America on the one hand, and the Irish
nation on the other, stands tho Cross of Jesus Christ.
Che Radicals know that tho sunlight of liberty cannot
shins upon the land overshadowed by that crosc.
English landlordism doss not exist In the States,
Yet even there the Irishman is not, and cannot be, a
freeman. What is he at the biliot box but tho con-
temptible mauaoled.brained instrument of his hated
and over-scheming Church ? America has given
him the splendid privilege of citizenship, and he,
in return, clerically commanded, would betray the
liberty Washington conferred on her. There are
millions in the States who know this fact, and you
know it; and you want us here, the descendants of
Englishmen and Scotchmen, to appland this plausible
pudden-hoaded green-hearted mountebank, that we,
sinking beneath the level of greasers, may traduce that
grand old country who gave us this splendid continent.
It won’t wash. One word before yon put this in tha dust-
bin. In England, in America, and here in Australia, there
are men who are not Orangemen, who are not Protes-
tants—men who have left the hot and atifliig atmos-
phere of Christendom to breathe the fresh air of the
splendid ideas of to day. They are silently watching
Ireland with tiger-liko eyes ; they are watching her
every move, and, while willing to admit •* that Eng-
land’s difficulty is Ireland's opportunity,’’ they are
determined that tho price of Ireland’s triumph sha’I not
bo England’s degradation. Let O’Donovin Rossa
and his priest-ridden loafers of New York, and
other College-green aspirants, take care that they
are not followed to the grave they are digging
for England. The bowie knife will out two ways—it
can be used in tha preservation as well as in the
destruction of an Empire."
“The Bulleti n” and its Oritic.
Yes, the igooriut Irish bate the English without d's-
or discrimination. And the ignorant English
hate tha Irish in the same fashion. But Irishmen who
can think, and Englishmen who can think—the number
is rapidly increasing—recognise the fact that the busi-
ness on hand is not o«e of race against race. The
intelligent Irishman perceives that the body of Eng.
lishmen who have profited by his misfortunes is small,
and constitutes a caste among Und flistinct from, the Eng-
lish people. The intelligent Englishman of the mechani-
cal and agricultural class perceive* that he has no in-
terest in grinding down the Irish peasant, and that such
as he have never been responsible for the iniquities
perpetrated in the past by aristocratic or plutocratic
coteries, in the name of the English people.
As these facts became recognised, the aliens-
tiou between the proletariats in tho two countries
is subsiding, and will further subside Wo are not mis.
taken about the sympathy of English Radicals with the
agrarian movement represented by the Land League.
We speak by book, or rather by newspaper, and are only
sorry we can't quote more fully than we do. The first-
fruits of the soil to the tiller thereof, is the principle
of the Irish Land League, and is rapidly becoming re-
cognised as of universal application. Into tho religions
question we hare never intruded and de jline to enter.
It is this intrusion of sectarian matters into purely
political contention, which has been employed by the
interested “sup rtor” classes to set the ‘‘people” of
oce race against the “people” of another, and by tho
divisions thus artificially created, to prey upon both.
It is chiefly because the principle is universal, ard not
"foreign,” that we trouble about the matter at all.
Let oar correspondent read what we say about iruo
greatness, in this issue, before accusing us of sny
inclination to traduce our grand old country. To
reason clearly it is necessary to purge the mind of
sentiment, even national sentiment. Onr principles
are equally applicable whether applied to the Irish,
the Egyptians, the Bulgarians, the Poles, the Boers, or
the—English.
We learn from the Morning Nonconformist that tie
Rev. Mr. Jkfferis last Sunday delivered from his
pulp't tho substance of onr article respecting Mr.
Tatlor’s apology, with the addition of a quarter-onuco
anathema, commencing, " Now in tho name of tais
chnroh, I,” &o., and with the exception that he omiUod
to mention Sir John Robertsons allegation that five
members had been drunk in tho Hon«o. The omission
was not intentional, perhaps. Mr. Jefferis may have
forgotten that bit of our article. In any case, wo con-
gratulate tho rev. gentleman in accepting competent
guidance, and shall bo glad to add his 500 hearers to onr
own 100.000 readers, as persons who have had im-
pressed upon them the poor figure which Parliament
baa out in this matter. Our sole regret is that probably
wo can’t fairly count tho 500 as an addition. In all
likelihood every man jack of them had read The
Bulletin, and recognized the source of their pastor’s
inspiration.
The Protestant Standard is so hardened in the vice
of evil spoakiag, by a long course of slandering Roman
Catholics, that no one notices particularly a lie meteor
lees in its columns. It is welcome, therefore, to state
that Mr. Taylor is “the admired of The Bulletin for
his filthiness.” and that wo had “an article stating our
approval of Mr. Taylor's fou'-mouthednees, saying that
it was time to throw <dt sham, which of course included
politeness, and the polite language of gentlemen.”
What are those overfed clerical bullies giving its ? Is
it inevitable that they must itick a lie or a suygnsiio
falsi into every sentence A hundred thousand people,
at least, read The Bulletin every week, and know what
wo do say, aud are quite capable of understanding what
we mean also. When the Standard gives its own
colouring to our plain statements, ns in this instance,
wo have only to quote its remarks to expose its petty
dlMagenuoueness to those hundred thousand people-
Want any mure, Barry ? The Protestant fix a n bmp
must be aware that we detest “ tmil-mouthednustf,”
considering ho.w often we have rated it for its orm.

Copeland the Scapegoat.
Ip it had been the habit of the Sydney Morning
Herald in all oases to subordinate considera-
tion far individuals to the interests of the public,
the manner in which it dealt with Mr. Cope-
land's speech at the St. Patrick banquet would
have bean unexceptionable. But, when it is con-
sidered that it has been the notorious custom of
that journal to throw the shield of suppression
over the misdeeds and laches of public men, and
that on no previous and similar occasion has it
ever adopted tho course which it employed in the
ca?o of Mr. Copeland, the public will look for
some extraordinary cause for that extraordinary
departure from the traditions of the Herald,
rue essenso of Justice is equity. A system of
suppression applied to the characters and pro-
ceedings of public men we have always regarded
as essentially vicious. The public has a right
to look to tho Press, when that organisation
pretends to serve as the eyes and ears of tho
people and the guardian cf their interests,
for full and fair information respecting re-
presentative men. Iho motto of the Press
should be “ nothing extenuate, nor aught sot
down in malice.” That admirable principle
has been habitually violated by the Herald, in
the first regard. Its habitual suppressions have
been effectual extenuations. Nay, more, it is but
the other day that, when Mr. Bedmond referred
to Hr Henry Pakkes as devoid of honesty in
private and of principle in public life, the
Herald, with a full knowledge of Sir Henry’s
career in both respects, actually took up the
cudgels on his behalf, and conveyed to its readers
the impression that Mr. Bedmond had basely
slandered a man to whom neither allegation could
in any sense apply. A certain very prominent
politician, on a recent public occasion, made an
exhibition of himself precisely similar to that
which the Herald attributes to Mr. Copeland
On that occasion, also, a Herald reporter was
present, and not a word of report or comment—
not so much as a hint of tho incident—was pub-
lished by that journal. On repeated occasions a
certain reverend gentleman who used to furnish
the Herald with its condensed Parliamentary re-
ports, was drunk in the House, and not a word of
the occurrences was permitted to reach the
Herald fi readers.
• • •
Suppression: Suppression : Suppression, has
been the constant rule. That would be iniquity
enough. But it is converted into infamy by sud-
denly making an exception of one man, whose
offence differed in no degree from others who had
been indulged with silence. This sudden out-
burst from a complaisant and indulgent silence
into an explosive shriek of horror, conveys an
accusation falsified by tho exaggerated significance
which naturally attaches to so sensational a
change of system. Just as the Herald has dis-
regarded the maxim to nothing extenuate, so it
has, in this instance, violated the precept to
“ naughtset down in malice.” Tho exception made
of Mr. Copeland is clearly malicious. His teal
offence was his presence at the St. Patrick's ban-
quet as a Minister, sitting cheek by jowl with the
Herald’s bSte noir, Mr. Bedmond. It is a
matter of common knowledge that the conductors
of the Herald had endeavoured by every device
to prevent that occasion being suooessfnl as a
demonstration. They had shown themselves in-
tensely irritated by tho absence of public men of
any standing from tho Protestant Hall meeting,
and had predicted for St. Patrick’s Day, through
the columns of their evening edition, discreditable
scenes. As up to the eleventh hour the occur-
rences of the day had given the lie to their
inflammatory predictions, Mr. Copeland’s ince-
herenoo under interruption was seized upon as a
godsend. This is the only possible explanation of
the extraordinary departure from custom by tho
Herald, unless it bo admitted that, stung by
strictures respecting its habit of suppression, it
had suddenly resolved to initiate once and for
ever a system diametrically opposite.
We have no personal information as to Mr.
Copeland’s condition when he spoke at the
banquet. We infer from the unusual style of the
Herald’s report that he was very drunk. If
such were the case, Mr. Copeland has merely
justified his ordinary reputation by tendering his
resignation as a Minister of the Crown. That
men who cannot observe the decencies of life
should hold high office is not to be tolerated. But
in order that the principle bo justly applied, its
application should be general. There is no jus
tioe in making fish of one man, and fowl of half-a-
score of others. There is no fairness in making
Mr. Cop «land a scape-goat. By all means lot
na hound out of public life men who bring disgrace
upon onr institutions and upon their positions. But
if we commence the operation, let us go to work
armed with fairness and justice. Let us expose
and degrade all the guilty, not select for dis-
grace one man who possesses, in greater pro-
portion than most, countervailing virtues, and
leave undisturbed others on whose behalf
scarcely any compensating qualities can be alleged.
There is an answerable force in Mr. Taylor’s
demand whether fraud is less blameworthy than
intoxication. Let us put it whether habitual and
lifelong fraud is more pardonable than casual and
incidental drunkenness. We should witness Mr.
Copeland’s relegation to a private station with-
out a qualm, if every public man known to have
eimiliarly offended went with him. Let him march,
by all means, but when the drums beat for him
the rogues’ march, let not the country witness
such an infamy in the sight of Heaven as notorious
“drunks” and notorious swindlers wearing ail
the outward symbols of honour in the ranks which
escort and expel him.
• • •
We have no hope of such a consummation as
true justice would demand. Our public scoundrels
have too long enjoyed the immunities afforded by
tho systematic “ suppressions ” now so extra-
ordinarily departed from, to apprehend anything.
But in default, of this, Mr. Copeland is the
victim of a flagrant injustice, liqual justice with-
out distinction of persons is the pure ideal of fair
dealing. And if distinctions are to bo made, Mr.
Copeland assuredly would not suffer by com-
parisons. Apart from this wretched episode, his
character stands high among the reputations of
our public men. Hia integrity, private as well as
public, has never been darkened by so much as the
hiss of a malignant whisper. It is absolutely un-
sullied, and would-be detractors recoil from it in
despair. Hia abilities are admittedly above the
average. His earnest devotion to his public
duties as a Minister, short though his tenure of
office has been, has already wan recognition. He
is bluff, downright, and candid. These are vir-
tues which should avail much. They are virtues
which will avail much with the people of this
colony, despite the studied malice of the Herald
and the shameless malignity of tho Evening
News.

The Roman Catholics of Wellington, N. Z.,
lately presented Bishop Moran with an address It

The fifth anniversary of Victor Emanuel’s
death was solemnly kept in Romo. Hundreds cf dele,
gates oome every year and kneel at bn tomb in (he
Pantheon, where veteran soldiers of the Italian army
are always oh guard. Tf.e King and Quoen went early
in the day in deep mourning, but the most touching
sight was that of the old soldiers who came. There
were hundreds of them; most of >hem old, many
maimed, all wounded; 1he : r breasts glit'ering with
medals and crosses; walking erect wLh measured
tread as if on parade; beading low before the spot
where their chief sleeps.
The cablegrams anent the alleged attack on
that most ardent tbirster for notoriety, Lady Florence
ffixie, are of a thrilling,description. Lady Florence his
bfeu a great traveller; visited, ia company with Mr.
Dixie, her husband, Patagonia, and other wild ooun-
tries, the oalv export from whence to this country is
artists and editors. She was '* special" for the Morn-
ing Post at the Zulu War, and wrote some very nioa
work-box and woollen-slioper letter’. Subsequently, she
reprinted her letters in a book, and this circumstance
may account for the attack upon her. No other reason
suggests itself to us at present.
Algernon Swinburne, the poet, is as mad as
poets usually are. He gave a dicner party, the other
day, and, on a friend asking him what he was partaking
of, he calmly replied .- *• Some monkey.” He is fond
of strange dishes, and would, probably, goanna-whero
to taste •' goanna." Ha wears his hair long, like the
celebrated bards out here. But (his is not the maddest
thing ha does. The apex of madness was when he had
his photo, taken—u 'aDams.s—with AdaLaacs Menken.
His friends lost all hope cf him after that, and he is
now a kind of “Vathek.” His domestic arrangements
are said to resemble these of Eugens Sue. Or more so.
This is the wav the London correspondent of
the Bostbat Gazette sptaka cf the present Secretary
o! State for tha Colonies "Her Majesty must always
regard him (the Secretary) as the traitor Earl, who for
a long time hampered and finally helped to upset tho
Beaconsfleld Ministry, and the cannot but be well
aware chat ' high though his titles, proud his name,
bouediess his wealth as wish can claim,* the B irl of
Darby is in reality one of the meanest of God’s
creatures ” If we, out hare, were to speak of even a
C.M.G in this way, we should probably be hanged or
imprisoned for life. Whenever we want to toll the
truth, we shall go to India—cr Hades; we don’t care
which.
The mystery of Walter Montgomery's death has
never been solved. He was American by birth, and on
his first appearance as Mare Antony in New York, tha
people raved His oration over the dead body of Cte ar
roused wild eirihusiusm, and three times be had to say
it—a great tax on any man’s powers. But his death
was the strangest of all. On a steamer he mat tho
beautiful Winnetto Montague, and both loved at sight.
They married, and all believed they lived hoppily, till
one day, entering her rooms at tho Langbam, ho said :
•' Madame, I honoured you by making you my wife. I
now honour myself by making you a widow," stepped
into the bath-room adjoining, and shot himself through
the head. Some said she deceived him; others, he her.
Bat the mystery is unsolved.
Wiggins, the weather prophet, has been inter-
viewed by a N.Y. Herald reporter at Ottawa, Ontario,
regarding tho failure of his prediotiors of a storm ou
February 9 that was to sweep the eyries of the Ame-
rican eagle from the Atlantic to tho Pacific coast.
Wiggins said “ The astronomical day begins at noon
on meridian cf London, and our day begins at twelve
o’clock at night, I overlooked this faot, so that the
side of the earth presented to the planetary force was
opposite to that to which I gave it. I did not notice
my mistake until this evening, and tho storm foil on
tbe Paoifii instead of ihe Atlantic. This is (hr first
storm prediction that I ever made that did not take
p’aca. We will git the tail end of the storm yet. It will
strike heavily on the east coast of Africa. However,
the failure of this storm removes a world of responsi-
bility from my mind, for the storm I predicted for
Much 10 (all over Australia, &c.) has hung over me
like a nightmare, on account of the horror it has
struck on the public mind throughout the world, as
evidenced by tbe pile of letters daily received, and if
this storm had happened, hundreds, in anticipating the
March storm, would have become insane through fear of
its results.” “ Will yen now retire from the field as a
weather prophet ?’’ “ Yes, as far as publi Mug letters
in newspapers goes."
Thus a London writer on the horrible Edwards-
Whitmarshoase: —*' Had Da Ed ward vs faced tbe charge,
instead of committing suicide, how many people would
have been as ready to say, ‘Oh, there’s sos.et.birg in
it,’ as with him Ling dead ih?y w re to say, ‘There’s
nothing in it ?’ It is contended that he was cowardly
to seek refuge in death. But we must remembt r with-
out suoh a practical proof of torture the public are very
apt to take the ordinary view of scandal againt a man.
It is very like the wail that goes up when a woman dies
in the street of starvation Thousands read the case
and say. • Why, it I had known, I would have given her
help* Quite so. Yet if.the woman applied to any
one of those thousand people five minutes before her
death, they would one and all have looked upon her as
a beggar and told her to go away As a n atter of fact,
it was the readiness of the world to believe ill «f any
one that drove Edwardes to suicide. * I am ruined,’ he
said ; • the accusation is death to a professional man-’
That meant that, guilty or innocent, the world would
catch up the whisper of scandal and cherish it. And
be was right. _ It was tbe cold uooharitableness of the
wor'd—its desire to magnify evil, its love of scandal,
“•opbelief in tho purity of cran or woman—that drove
william Whitfield EJwardes to his death quite as much
as the use made of the complication by Michael Whit-
marsh." «
Mr. Joseph Cowaa, M.P, for Newcastle-on-
j the great Radical, and of t he Irish Land
league, is thus addressed by “ Kosmos" in the Loncjoh
W08LC;—. u Th» stranger who saw jou in the neigh-
bourhood of Westminster would probably pronounce
you a decent sort of working man, somewhat over-
ansteus perhaps to buttonhole his Parliamentary repre-
sentative in the central ball of Bt. Stephen’s. It he

sion might be confirmed. A closer examination might

say of Jce Cook—it he by any miracle happened to learn
that an insect of that size was in existence And
we wonder how the dickens Joe came to imagine
that he could weave out of his little brain any string
long enough to plumb the depths of Strauss. But, put-
ing these oonuEdrnms aside, this is what the Herald
publishes about the Impeiial and Royal “infidel”:—
The Princess has always cultivated a most lively
intercourse between her husband and her children, as
well as between herself and her nursery, much more
than is usually the habit in Royal households. . . .
The Grown Princess oau only be called a model
wife and mother, whoso example is worth imitating
in more respects than one The Prin-
cess takes great interest in all works of charity
and contributes to them as much as in her
power, but more or le a in secret
Whenever the time shall come when she is on the
throne of Germany, she will certainly not be found
wanting in generosity, kind-hearted no is, and charity,
though so many voices call her irreligious. Her views
on the latter subj act are indeed very free, which is all
the more to be wondered at, as she is the daughter of
orthodox England." Fancy Granny referring to the
religions views of a professed freethinker, simply as
'very tcee,” when Puoh a torrifio tfplthot os •*unbe-
coming ** remains in her vocabulary! Then the Herald
continues that when the present Emperor—the noto-
rious Pious Billy, who used to wire to “dear Augusta”
telegrams which read like “licked t.be Parley-voo’s
aerain—slaughtered seven thousand (7000), burned four
tillages — resultp, three thousand widows, eighteen
thousand orphans, forty bedridden people roa f t<?d
alive in their cottages — praise God who his had
a visible hand in all our proceedings ” —well, when
he goes to Heaven, and is appointed curator of
the water-tap, charged with the business of seeing
that no saint in gl ry is humane enough to pass over a
drink U the poor souls frying in hell, like he fried the
bedridden folks on earth; well, then “the position of
the Crown Prince and Crown Piinoess will bs totally
changed; so will therefore also be their behaviour in
many respects. The opera and the ballet will certainly
not bo so mnch favoured then as they are now, but the
dramatic art will surely find greater patronage than it
enjoys at present, for both their Royal Highnesses and
their children take great interest in tjiis art. . . All
the Liberals look forward to her advent to the throne,
and only the Conservatives are somewhat against her,
as she is unfavourable to so many of the traditions of
this party.” The ballet to be discountenanced by these

information I Why, we believe that if the Q wen’s

the Herald would not back up Parkes in preventing

Jay Gould is about the richest mania America. If
Vanderbilt is a raliway-kiDg.Jay Oonld is a rolling-stock
emperor. Probably be could, if called upon, put down
ten dollars to every one that could be planked by
Mackay the bonanza-king. Twenty years ago, ho war
a "kerbstone broker" in the City of New York.
Kerbstone brokers are peouliar to America. Dead
brokers are the outcome of a taste for journalism in
Australia. A kerbstone broker is a gambler in stocks
on a small scale. Suppose certain shares are selling
to-day at a bundma dollars a share. You have a
hundred dollars which yon in vet t. Very well, you go
to a kerbs <oi)e broker end p-y him a dollar deposit on
egch share of a hundred, Next day the call is made,
and if the stock has risen one per cent you get your
money back and a hundred dollars in sddi-ion, bat if it
ba» fallen yon lose your deposit. Jay i ottered about la
th’3 way until ho became a partner of Fiske. Hoon
after, the two got on the Board of Directorship of the
Erie Railway, and by degrees got the entire manage-
ment of tbe concern in their own hands Then they
commenced a pleasant little game, facetiously ■ known
as " milking the road.” Ail lift stock required on that
railway was bought of Fisie and Gould, wh > might
choose, just to keep up tbe j >ke. to call them-
selves Smith and Rjbiasou, or any other names that
struck their fancy as being mu deal, for the time being.
Piske was ultimately shot in an ctfair about a woman,
and Jay had to keep datk for a while When
hia name was again pr minont, ho was discovered
to be a chief shareboldor in tbe Union Pacific
Railway, the stock of which immediately roe© from
nothing to par. He then s’ld several mLlion dollars
worth to a Syndicate, and turrei straight round
and bought up a parallel line, tbe shares of which were
then going bogging at seventeen dollars. As soon as it
became known he had d-.ne t.fei», they commenced to
rise until th< y wera hard to get at 117 dollars a -bare 1
His next move was to consolidate these t»o roads, and
then buy up tbe Toledo, Wabash, and Western Rail-
way, otherwise known at that time as the “two streaks
of mat and tbo right-of-way,” the stock of which was
then quoted at a dollar e share It at once rose to a
hundred dollars a share. Jay being a philanthropist,
of course desired I lie greatest good for the greatest
number, and parted with an immense number of theie
to tbe eager public. Ho then ran this despised raiiwiy
into Chicago, the greatest commercial ventre in the
United States, and from thence down to Kansas city,
which is going to be another great emporium of com-
merce. ttinco then, an Euglish syndicate has offered
him money enough to buy a controlling interest in
every railway west of the Mississippi, on the simple
condition that he should guarantee them three per
cent, interest on their oapit al This he had to refuse,
because the long-beaded 'members of the Californian
railway ring had determined, and shown that they had
the ability to carry oot their determination, to b;o k

h*-d yourself in a room with a counter running
through. A netting ot wire gauze goes from this
counter up to the ceiling. Through this you can speak
to a cleik. Behind this are the ofiisea of Jay’s
partners. Behind those again is his own office, which
has a buck stairca e through which he can escape

In a fine house, and cones d>wa to town every morn-

living above him who had a faster yacht than his. Each
morning the £oap-bo>ler used to pass Jay and make
faces at him. No notice being taken of this, the soap-
boiler commenced to yell out derisive remarks as he
steamed by. Then Jay got mad and he oidared a
yacht to be built which should boat lightning. It is
being built now. The inside of it, wl en finished, will be
completely filled with bci'ers. And J iy will probably
have to sit on the rudder or on the outrigger to balance
it. This is all very wall, bathe will have a devil of a

Plain English — Continued,
It is indicative of the difflhnlty in which the IHebald
must iiavo found itself, when endeavouring to j notify
.ho extraordinary departure from its traditions in giv.
ug a verbatim report of Mr. Copeland's speech, with
ill tho varieties of interruption, for tha first time iu its
history, that it adduced Mr. Redmond's p'eser.oe at
he banquet as a reason why Mr. Copeland shc.n’dh&vb
n ecn on his best behaviour. Tha following, incredible
•s it may seem, is a verbatim quotation from H e
Jerald s leading prtio’e cn tbe occurrence, and it will
a seen that the Herai d stands verbatim reporting j ast
s badly as any one else:—’ At this time, when the
meanest member should have felt Hut he mutt be care,
‘a!, at a barque 1 ; at which a Mo ruler of th-,- English
Parliament was present,*’ *3. Conceive the Her am,
sfcning.omrtcouTy to Mr. Redmond— tho man ■ hot
with human hate,” the “itinerating lecturer,” the f e l.
on who should he in SCiniaiuham g»o', or ban trod out-
•ight—as •’ a mem bar of the English Parlkmoat,”

iia good o icioa! What desperate straits oar coutem.

“The public will be glad to heir that at the St Patrick’s
demonstration at Botany there was an almost total-
abscnco of rowdyism and intoxication." Thin tho
.3 M Herald on Monday morning. Why “almost”
octal P Hud there been the faintest exception, is it not
certain that tbe Herald would have dila’ed upon it
md magnified it to the utmost? The fact is that tho
Herald peopk are dolefully disappointed. Tha admir.
able order and good temper of the multitude compelled
them on Monday to give the lie to their utterances of
Saturday. Compare with the above expression what they
wrate iu the Echo on Saturday “ We know that the
better side of the Irish nature will not bo brought out.
. . . Wo know (I) that the day may be a black day in
the annals of the future—that it may give birth to evil
influences, to increase and strengthening of the bonds
which now divide ” [do bonds divide ?—we thought
bonds united] “llieetforts and consume the strength of
the nation, ev.n if be not g. worse day than some of the
same name sadly remembered in other cities of Aus-
tralia." Yes, the public will be glad to hear 1 that there
was a total absence of rowdykm, or—to emerge from
the Herald s damaging negatives—that there was
thorough good order-, at Botany. The public will be
giud, but the Herald people must be deuced sorry.

A sad relic has been unearthed near Adelaide.
About twelve months ago, a boy named Charles Grimes
was misted from his hose. It was thought he had met
with foul play or had been kidnapped, and the parents,
who are wealthy, had his photo, sent to almost every
towaaud port. Largo rewards also were chertd. Now
the li tli fellow’s remains have been discovered under
circumstanors pointing to the fact that death was
occasioned by si If joatiou const q aont on a heavy fall of

There has been a strike among the typos, at

named George Scare. This boy is tbe stepson of a man
who employed tho Chinaman now in custody on tus-
pioiou. Tho alleged murderer presented a deposit
receipt to a local bank, and had ho received the money,
ho intended taking the lid with him to Melbourne.
The receipt presented is identical with that issued to

And hotter than the sun.

The coming London dramatist (comedy writer)
■ tnaC H Stephenson, author of “Impulse,” who is
fond of nmqueradirg under the nom de pluuio of Savllle
. “ h i)e Clement Scott, who collaborated with
Stephenson in the clever adaptation of “Diplomacy,’
adopted the name of Poitou Rowe on the playbill.
Gilbert in a number of bis piece-, also adopted a pseu-
Sim. For instance. “The Happy Land” was by
“Gilbert a Beckett and F. Labour Tomline; his
a.IVotion of “he Eeveillon and of ” Ls Chapeau
d’Italia” by the latter name alone. And,
while on dramatists, we may state that Mr. E. W.
Godfrey 1 brother of the author of the Mabel Walzes,
is also to the fore with “The Parvenu,” a comedy of
“The Guv’nor " type, to the authorship of which mys-
terious production Mr. Godfrey oan probably lay corns
o’aim since “ Mr. B. Lnnkostor ” has never been heard
of since And this at once brings us to a couple more
aspirants fer fame in th ; s liue-onr old drar friend,
Losoombe Hearrell, and Mr. Walter Parke, the latter
rwt-author of "Les Mantoanx Noirs,” his literary
partner in the adaptation leing Harry Panlton. who
eetre years (many) ago distinguished himself by
writing, in conjunction with in* brother, the vfry
worst burlesque ever known. It was called - The
Three tansket-dears.” and was produced at the Strand,
and damned in ore act! Seairell’s new venture (yon
can’t crush him I)—which he is good enough to forward
with his ooiDuliments —is called “Estrella, and is
“ written by Writer Parke, and” (we quote from the
cover) “composed by Luscombe Searelle, (') with
several Ivrics by the composer.” The piece (3 acts)
opens with a chcrns (‘ by the composer’ ) Of which
this is the commencement,.
“ Far o’er the moon-tipped sea
We come, we come to thee!
Fai lal lal la 1 Fal lal lal la 1
We sing right merrily.
• Let pleasure be unconflned,’
For love is upon the wind ;
Fal lal lal la! Fal lal lal la!
Which is comparatively unmeaning. Then we find the
Count, “ a fiery militaire,” arrives, and he sings the
following— and a lot more: —
“I am a military man,
I’ve fought in many a clime;
In victory’s march I’ve led the van.
Been wound* d every time;
Skirmish warm I
Sirge and storm I
Deadly breaeh and hope forlorn ” etc.
Then comes artless Estrella, and warbles in this vein
(gifted composer once more)
“ I am a very, very wretched maid,
As you can see, I'm sure;
I have a sweetheart and I’m much afraid
I ne’er shall eee him mere.”
We don’t think we need quote any more to prove that
by this time Seatrell (we esn’t vary the spoiling any
more) will have sold “Estrella” for several millions.
It’s pretty certain, aajhcw, that no one will want, over
the new venture, to either ChaH Seatrell or Hide
Parke.

When Sara Bernhardt was in America, a Ken-
tucky critic not being able to make a simple farmer
comprehend the rationale of (esthetic criticism from
the jump, went into explanations, as thus: “Observe
tbs ductile adaptation of her divine form to the exi-
gencies cf the situation.” “That’s so,” responded the
fanner, not knowing what the critic meant, hut think-
ing that he ought to say something. “ Remark the
soft moonlight radiance of her angelic eyes,” continued
the gusher. "I dew,” said the farmer. “And did you
ever hear such a wooing dulo't sweetness of persuasion
from a human voice before?” “Waal, I guess not,
siranger; Deacon Doolittle ain’t in wilh Sairey ”
“And the enticirg charm of her unconscious smile,
who could resist it! ” “It’sraytber meltin’, I calcu-
late and think,” “ Of.” dontinued the critic, now
thoroughly worked up, “of her lava-like temperament—
of the luminous light of a genius which ” *' Say,
stranger, I’ve an idea,” interrupted tho farmer, “ I’ve
hit upon Sairey’s wonderfuleat talent; Sairey is the
greatest Clingist on this airth ” “ The grea’est what ?’’
“Clingiet. That’s a fact, yen b*t. Sairey can cling
tighter than anybody else! she could give an ivy balf-a-
mile atari and win. Sairey has more ways cf dingin’
w a nsau than the stage ever knowed afore her time.
Sairey is good with one arm, but with two an airth-
auake wouldn’t move her. Look at her kctchin’ Mr
sltoryg, fust round the reck, then round tho waist,
srter that by bis right arm, t'jen by his left. She

Mr. Bayliss, well known all through this sidereal
system, took the Gaiety Theatre baok into his sole pos-
session on Wednesday night last. Mr. Bayliss is cele-
brated for his affability, and worshipped for his
winsome laugh. He sprats proudly of icatoring the
Gaiety to its pristine glory. Charles Bright lectures
there on Thu-sday and Friday nights. Mr. Sheridan
plays “Lear" on Saturday night. There will then
pro'bably bo a short seison of Bully Powloy Italian

Mrs. Langtry refuses to let an actor called J. G.
Grahnmo play har lovers. She says ho smells too
strong of lager and limburger cheese. And this re-
minds us that actors and actresses are invariably fond
of onions. It was only during the Pomeroy season
that an actor had to address to a young lady the fol-
lowing lines :—
** Your breath is as the scent of early morn
When on the dewy breeze the odours float
Of cowslips and of lilies."
Then he added, 11 Dutch choose and eschalots—

A rumour has reached us that W. J.
Holloway and Georgs Darrell have taken the
Melbourne Opera House. They (so it is raid)
are to produce for three months “ new and entirely
original dramas” from Geerge’s pen, and W.J. will star
as Romeo. It is not generally known, but they are
building a theatre in London—"The Grand” (fitting
title !)— on purpose to produce the new and original
dramas from George's p*n. After his thioo months’
triumph in Melbourne, Mr. Darrell will go to Adelaide.
By the way, Tnu Advertiser critic there has got
a big lodgment against some one for an Alfred
Mouling. And, in connection with Adelaide, wo are

We have been specially favoured this week with
letters from members of the thoatiicnl perfesh. We are
consequently happy. Mr. William Horsce Bent tends
us three volumes to explain that “Bent’s Minstrels”
do not exist, and, ooueequentiy. cou’d not have pin' ed
at Auckland (ae we tta«- <3 in “Poor Player") to “ flfiy-
bob hourea.” See hew luridly he puts it—a matter, too,
that is cf enthralling interest to the public :—
“There are no ‘Bent’s Minstrels’ in exist-
ence; nutter have been a ‘Beat’s Minstrels.’
There teas a ‘Bent and Bachelder’s Minstrels,’
but thev were disbanded at Adelaide, early in
June, X882. Afterwards reorganised as ‘Bach
elder’s Minstrels. * ”
William Horace says he is late of the Hey weed Comedy
Ccnopany, lut has severed hie connection with it. And,
to come to more (we mean less) distinguished people,
we have to chronicle wuh sorrow that our old favourite
Mudame Fanny Simonson has broken down at last,
icing taken eericusly ill while playing in “Tbs
Hermit’s Bell ” People say that Martin—however,
it’s norm t£ cur business And Mr, Gordon Gocch
writes to ray ho has joined the operatic stage in Christ-
church, tinging in “Maritana,” ard being cast for Don
Jo(6 It eetma the prompter was effective in the words,
and Gordon in the music. For joining the ranks of the
pcifeeh we consider Gordon to bo a young Gccch.

We are informed that tbs musical critic cf the
Auckland Free Laste is a cobbler. Well, what matter.
How many critics here are—tinkers F
George Bignold will only give the Henry ku a
for two mere nights ; as the " Romany Rye” is to be
produced on Saturday. This time the scenery is Hen-
ning's, so we shall have an opportunity of comparing
his atylo with Gordon’s in the entire production. As
for Gordon he has gained himself everlasting glory by
his work here —more particularly in ‘'Aladdin;'* so
Hennings has rather a stiff thing to get over. We
mean get over Gordon's style. And no one can help
over this style He is not a pretty girl with neat
ankles and ironze boots.

There is a certain aator here who is “ rather
a giddy old sort,’’ though very clever, and exceedingly
droll. Well, ho epi-d a pretty girl in the theatre while
playing the other night, and as the girl was going out a
little boy put a note into her hand, in which it said —
“ Meet me to-morrow at hslf-past 12 at Peapes and
Shaw’s." Taking out her pencil the young lady wrote
back as follows:—“Of course, I will, you dear old
creature. I have always longed to makeyour charming
wife's acquaintance.’* Tnat night the dear old creature
kicked a super, ani stamped on his wig.

Tuesday was Towers’s last night of manage-
ment at the Gaiety. Since Frank’s departure, Rain-
ford has taken the reins, and with a judicious selection
of pieces, and really Beau Brnmmelllan courtesy of
manner, has contrive d to pull in the money with Sheri-
dan and Davenport. Mr Bay lees now iakes over the
theatre, and produces “ Rose Michell ’’ with Mrs. Glad-
stano and Sheridan. This is a very strong combination,
aud should draw a lot of money. The forthcoming pro-
duction of this piece was announced by us about two
months ago. But we are generally about that much
abcad of contemporaries in information, a decade in
logic, and a century in rpalling.

The Aoadomy of Music is no more bossed by
Frederick Haustend, Efq , J.P. Hegarty has taken
the management of the place on his own shoulders, aud
hie once more dug out the Hibernioon, in ecu junction
with which he gives away gilts. The show is a very
bright one, because it is plavod by people who under-
stand it. There is Tom Buckley for instance, who, how-
< v< r much he may be out of place in Shakospeart, is
certainly very great in Negro Minstrelsy—his dancing
being as good as his banjo eccentricities—and those are
both tiist-olass. May Vivian, too, in the vaiioty busi-
ness, is also very charming; and Miss Vesta Amor sings
with so much taste that when she is on you are almost
inclined to forget how many years the panorama has
been under the stage of the Queen’s It’s our opinion
they had to pull the theatre down to got it out. Shaw
Cross is like Old Nandy, Mr. Derm’s pensioner, a
sweet warbler, and to hear him “Gome the warbles"
gives us just as qiuoh pleasure as Old Nandy’s render,
ing of Strephon did Mrs. Plornifh. Johnny Cowan is
also in it, and one can always commend him when he
does not get carried away, acd become Charley Wright-
ish The dialogue is smart, and the gifts are dazzling.
The entertainment, therefore, as may be supposed, pos-
sesses a peculiar charm for the representatives of our
contemporaries. We are open to be bribed, of course.
But we trust when wo look in they won’t give us cither
the suite of furniture or the piano. It might—to those
who do not know us—look pointed.

Mr. Frank Cates is a very fortunate fellow.
Whenever ha has a benefit it doesn’t ru’n him. On
Tuesday night the Gaiety was almost fi ltd to see him
play lago. The moment we came in we noticed a
p> culiarity about the front seats. They were filled
with baldh< ads We counted twenty thr e old men as
bald as Chinese babies And, by tho way, we may as
well state here, as a piece of news which may be useful
to somebody, that bald-headed men are very irritable
There was ore sitting in front of us, and wo absent,
mindedly jotted down a few notes upon his skull, when
he turned round and wanted to fight. We made tho
rest of our notes with a chair-leg.

We have seen Mr. Sheridan as Othello before ;
but we forget what we thought of his performance
Now wo consider it very fine. It has defects; but so
has everything and everybody—ev*u we are only
human at times: at dinner-times. But it is powerful.
• • •
Which— and we are not grieved to say it, be-
cause we think no man need be nurt by being told that
he is not a giant—Mr. Cates’ performance ns lage i« not.
lago was a thorough villain—a very C M.Q. cf his time.
Mr. Cates is not a villain. And here is where our
theory oomos in. If a man has not the latent ingredients
of a scoundrel somewhere at the back of his head, he
can’t act the scoundrel with heartiness of purpose. He
must have gall and bile and bitterness, and a ttrotg
blade fibre of wickedness in bis nature. We could
pick out a dozrn members of Parliament who could play
lago without rehearsal and beat Mr. Cate* Realism i*
what the public of tho present day rcqu ri. And
though Mr. Cates was nearly letter-perfect in bis part,
and rolled bis eyes and worked his voice from a dismal
diapason to the pitch cf a screech-out in the _mpat
approved lago fashion, ho was not realistic. He is the
best actor in light ptrts we have in Australia, so he
needn't grieve that he is not Machiavellian. Ha has
one proud pre-eminence over most otner actors out
i erc. snyhew—he can speak English. He leaves for
Melbourne to j in Wybert Reeve at the end of next
month. Wo are sorry to lese him, teesuse he is a
charming f-How, acd bfciuse wo can ill spare our
mother tongue upon the stage.

Desdomoua (Miss Louise Davenport) looked
delicious in her snowy robes. And she acted charm-
ingly. Dear Louisa I Miss M. A. Melville was a most
serviceable Emilia. Poor little Isabella Camm we only
saw once, when she came in as a messenger We
thought we detected her afterwards as.the Dake’s
brother or something, but it was somebody else—pro-
bably Rainford. Mr Rayner, however, made an ex-
cellent Brabantio He acted sensibly. In fact, we
were curntised to find so much sense in so old a man.
Mr. F. Beverley as Montano was fair to middling—
mostly middling. Mr. A. L. Bruton as Cassio was
killed very nicely. We don’t know that we ever saw a
murder which gave us so much pleasure before. The
only objection wo had to it was that it did not occur
earlier m the play.
Dr George Benuett
Qua portrait this week is that of Dr. George
Bennett, a distinguished Australian scientist,
now in his 78th year. Dr. Bennett was born &t
Plymouth, and after a tour in India, returned to
England and studied for the meolioal profession.
a t an early age he took charge of a circumnavi-
gatory expedition, and the incidents of that tour
have given course to the current of his whole life.
He developed a taste for natural science, and his
contributions to the journals of the day gave
him a position among the world’s scientists.
Dr. Bennett’s works, “ Gatherings of a Naturalist
in Australasia,” and “ Wanderings in New South
Wales, Singapore, and China,” are standard
works, upon which the reputation of the author
as a man of deep research and wide experience
might alone rest. Dr. Bennett is a member of
many of the leading scientific associations and
institutions of Europe and America. He was the
first hon. secretary to the Sydney Museum, an
institution to which he has been a most ardent
supporter for mors than quarter of a century.
Dr. Bennett, notwithstanding his years, still lends
the assistance of his experience to any public
movement of a scientific character
Two Christian items from Melbourne by tele-
graph “ The plain clothes police say that prostitu-

DENOMINATIONAL DROPS.
The discreditable affiair in a Canterbury Presby-
terian church which has scandalized New Zealand
Christendc m, from the pockets of the poor to the bank-
books of the panois, is settled by—cash dswn. The
Bcv. Mr. Frazer Rives up the church in which he was
besieged, but holds on to the manse till he can get some
other house equally convenient to live in r ns prime
condition, however, is that Mr. Frazer gets £400.
Inferring recently in a leading article to the
No-Popery <«ry raised in connection with the Victorian
Eleotiors, the 8.M. HkfAt d remarks that “ this is ret
a time at which sectarian animosities ought to be
brought to the front.” It is fair to infer from this
that the Herald considers that there are times whm
sectarian animosities ought to bo brought to the front.
G’-anny is quite oonsis'ent in this, for the Herald baa
a lot to answer for in fostering sectarian bitterness in
this o«lony, It never misses a chance of attacking
Roman Catholics or Irishmen.
The income of the Archbishop of Canterbury is
£15,000 a v ear. The income of the Ai oh bishop of Paris
is £1600 Taking the early Christian ideal poverty as a
standard of holiness, the Archbishop of Paris is over
nine and a half times holier than his Grace of Canter-
bury. This looks noisshor for the Anglican*. But it
isn’t. The Archbishop of Canterbury, when ho dies,
doesn’t as much as take the price’cf a drink with him
on his way to the other world, where he arrives as roor
and rnlterable and shivering and naked as any cne of
the harmless outcasts whom his carriage-wheels spat-
torod with mud in bis progress—when alive—from his
place at Addington to his palace of Lambeth.
There are in Italy at the present time 32,523
monks and nuns whe live all the year round, as Barham
says, "on cabbage and hot cross buna ” And, what is
a peculiar coincidence, the flea census is higher in
Italy than in any other country In Europe, except,
perhaps, Spain, where there are more monks and nuns.
The monks and nuns, by the way, always die peaceably
—they are, as a rule, too lazy to die in any other
fashion. And when they go into the next world, and
are told by the ma»f or of ceremonies up there to “ go
ap higher,” they will probably ask for a eteam-lift.
The Rev. Dr. Collyer, of Brooklyn, U.8.A , is a
bad man. He says it is no harm to go to theatres and
concerts on a Sunday, and that a boy who goes swim,
ming on that day is no more likely to be drowned than
if ho had gone on any other day. Ho also thinks thi-t
poor people who have been working hard all the week
need some other kind of recreation than that of sitting
in a stntfy church hearing some st uffy old man drone
like a beetle in a dream. This is all very dreadful. We
shall next hear that a man may refuse to pay tithes or
subscribe to the missionary fund, without being damned.
And this will kill ns I
A pious fraud, who recently disappeared from
Sydney with a lot of money belonging to other people,
was for Borne months prior to his flight engaged in
many shady transactions All the time he was a great
pillar of the ohnrcb, and assisted in a substantial
pecuniary way everything conducive to holiness —from
a tea- fight to the purchase of a new altar cloth. But
it was rather rough that the parson should, on the
Sunday after bis constituent levanted, take for his
text, “For Barrabas was a robber,” and launch forth a
2 'owt. euathoma against the departed financier This
especially, coraidering that some of the sanctified
hypocrite’s relaUves happened to te in the front scats.
In the words of Temora Bailey and a lot of other
people, “their feelings can be better imagined than
described 1 ” Oh, and we wonder whether the church
will now hand back t« the swindler’s creditors and
victims the money he put into the plate, and so on?
Whenever a dissenting paper gets hold of such
an item as the following, it curdles the blood of its
readers with gory denunciation. Listen: “Father
Ignatius lately put the black veil on a Sister of the
English Benedictine congregation, who had completed
her two years’ noviciate. After a very gorgeous and
imposing ceremony, the girl was laid on a bier covered
with a pall, and carried away to a dark cell, where she
was to spond the rest of her life in solitude.” Every-
body who is not a Roman Catholic says this is horrible.
Everybody but we. We are net Roman Catholics, and
not fend of Roman Catholic imstitutions and yet wo
fail to see how this is so very dreadful. Wa hold that
those who have enough money to support themselves
for the rest of thtir lives, and ere without responsi-
bilities, have a peifsot right to do what they please
with their own persons. Those who have responsibili-
ties, or who haven’t money, have no business to phut
themselves up in oaverns If they have responsibilities
they should fulfil them; if they have no money they
shenld hump mortar or scrub floors. We have no
reverence for holy Iiz'ness But we have for freedom.
Consequently, we say that if any person who can afford
fancies livisg in a dungeon, then let him or her live in
a dungeon and welcome. People cf this taste would
never be of any use in the daylight. We are only sorry
that there are not more people in the world with this
fancy. The rick stiff that is gprken and written about
young lives being wasted in this fashion may be good
enough for readers of the Howl, but it is too watery
for ns. The very penona who speak and write it sue
young lives wasting away every day that breaks, and
say nothing. If they did they might have to put thoir
bauds in their pockets. Indignation in the other
instance costs nothing. Pah 1

Z. P. Y. Q. Sladen has written a weird poem —
*' Isabella, Isabella, I know an Isabella.” It is cut into
seven chunks, and, aa the seeond line in each chunk
ends with Isabella, the fourth line has to rhyme, in each
case, with some other 11 ella,” or the whole affair would
be ruined. To find those rhymes would be too gigantic
a task for most men, bat Sladen is a gigantic man. In
the first verso he punts Isabella under an “ umbrella."
In the same breath he finds that her lips are ruddy as
the vintage of “ Hubert do Castolla.” Still fresh, he
oomes to the mark in verse three with a “copra di
capella,” though what it did to Isabella, or she to it, ia
not clear He's getting a bit tired, but, after another
scrimmage, he finds he has something to “tell hor”
(oh, shades of Cookneydom!). At number five it’s a
very hard squeeze, but he pulls himself together, and,
fishing in the troubled waters of his intellect, get hold
of a young man and introduces him to Isabella as “the
hero boy of Pella I” Then, neither geology, history,
geography, nor natural history can avail, and, after
madly thumbing his rhyming dictionary, he again
approaches poor Isabella, to ” quell her.” By this time
he has quelled himself. Ha has another verse to polish
off; but, alas 1 six “ ellas " have reduced to chaotic
vacuity whatever mind he possesses, and, feebly reach-
ing out, he again grasps at “tell her,’’ and pins it on
the tail c f hapless Isabella. This ends what
Sladen calls an Australian Lyric. Bub how sick
Isabella must be of suoh a feller I However, Bard
Sladen’s poem on Isabella isn’t the only one extant.
We want to a nigger- minstrel show in the long ago, and
there heard a ditty of which this is a chunk —
“ Oh my Isabella,
She loved another feller,
I took my umbrella
And bit him on the smaller.
And knocked him down the cellar” —
Bssidas the foregoing there’s a lot which is either
utterly forgotten cr mixed up in our memory with a
little chanson oommaaoiag—
The monkey married the baboon’s sister,
Smacked his lips and thoa ha kissed her —
Kissed her so bird that he raised a blister —
Then she set up a yell. Oh yah 1 Oh yah I
Before Poet Sladen has another brew wa recommend
him to interview some brother bard, who possesses a
perfect knowledge of the lyric literature of nigger
minstrelsy. By the way, Bnzaoott who’s yonr poet

Thus a correspondent -. —“ Somebody has been
writing to the Harchbeus hup— which wo boliovo is
now printed in a tomb, probably with a view of being
ready for death at any moment—regarding Catholic
Yonug Men’s Societies. Ho seems to want to know
something about their inner economy, which the
Haechbrushup docs not appear to bo able to reveal.
We can illuminate him. The writer of this was, some
years ago, a member of one of these societies over in
Port Adelaide. Being able to spell with something
like an approximation to correctness, and not being, at
that time, notoriously immoral, he was asked by the
parish priest to join the society in order to strengthen
the olean-toothed element which was then very much
in the minority. He joined. The society was mostly
composed of hodmen, wharf-lumpers, and mud-
punchers, with an infusion of tally-olorka and grocers’
assistants. These latter, by reason of their superior
tone and higher culture, arrogatsd to themselves the
entire control of the concern, and distributed the right
worthy offices between them. The writer, being sup-
posed to bo the possessor of a somewhat airy humour,
was at onoo admitted into this distinguished inner
circle Then ha commenced his brief but brilliant
career of left-hand supporter of something with a
green snrcingls round its neck, by proposing a by-law
that every new member admitted shonld “shout" for
this emblazoned band. This proposition was received
with much enthusiasm—by the band. The rest of the
society did not count. They used to slouch ia diffi-
dently, make an embarrassed scraps to the right worthy
president, and then sit down with the palms of their
great hands laid flit on the knees of their muddy
moleskins, and remain quiet as bricks for the
rest of the eve ing except now and then when
c ne would ask another in a mufflid whisper “ if he had
suoh a thing as a chew of terbackor on him ’’ Then a
bitter debate would take place among the daily-clerks
and pork-salesmen with regard to the burning question
as to whether one worthy brother should be allowed to
interrupt another worthy brother when the ether
worthy brother was addressing the right worthy
president. This being tattled by a reference to the
book of rules, somebody would discover that one of the
worthy supporteis was not wearing his surcingle at the
angle required by the ancient and honourable laws ef
the society. Then another aoriwionious argument
would take place, and tbc wharf-lumpers would bo
treated to a display of treaele-tab rhetoric such as t hey
had never heard in their unenlightened lives before.
This sort of thing palled on the writer after he had
stood about two night* of ib, so he managed to get
another by-law made that candidates for membership
should bo initiated early in the evening, and that the
entire society should then adjourn to the corner hotel
and “wet” the ceremony. As many of these new
members had just arrived from the country with big
cheques, the sciety as a rule did not return to the
rooms, bat used to straggle homo by twos and throes in
the early daws. On one occat ion, when a successful store,
keeper from ihe Northern Areas was initiated, the whole
guild—barring the present scribe, of course—got boiling
drunk. The secretary was discovered in the small hours
of the morninv, by the pirieh prieet who had been out
on a “sick call,” at full length in a horse-trough, with
his head just above water, and his ooat and boots lying'
on the footpath beside him. He had imagined that he
was going to bed, and had got so far with undressing
himself when weariness overcame him, and he rolled
in. The president was missing for two days, and was
finally discovered away down in the swamp as mad as a
hatter, and as naked as when he was born. The vice-
president was never diEcovered —at least as far as the
writer knows. It seems he bad got a notion in his
head that it was a good timo for fishing, to he wan-
derod off from the rest of the crew to hunt for wornm
in the mud of the Port River They searched for him
with a divining rod next day, but in vain. Probably he
has silted down to Pimatory by this time. This affair
created quite a scandal in the congiegation, and the
present inoffensive paragrapher was accused of having
introduced all this abandoned profligacy into what-had
before hia fiendish advent, been a body of good and
moral young men, and was also publicly informed by
the elders of the congregation that fee would go to
Hell, Which has oonso true. This is all he knows just
uow about Catholic Young Man's Societies, Anybody
wishing to know more will have to pay.”
Monsignor Dupanloup, then Bishop of Orleans,
in p.rgsing in favour of cremation, pointed ont that it
rendered burying alive while In a trance impossible
and ho drew an appalling picture ot the agony of living
interment. He spoke cf the corpse, tight bound in its
cerements jet still breathing, vaguely conscious of all
the preparations ot sepulture, and yet unable to utter a
word. “ Suddenly, with an effort of a frantic despair,
it brealrs the silence, and a long shriek from the pallid
lips falls upon the ears of the horrified attendants.
My friends," said Bupauloup, after a long pause and
drawing a deep breath, *■ that corpse was I who speak
to you.” But the Bishop seems to have overlooked
that if he was conscious of all the preparations for in-
terment, he would have been j sst as conscious of all
the interesting preliminaries to being popped into the
oven and could scarcely have been any more comforc-
able. Cremation will cotta in, but it will have to fight
its way with better logic than that used by the resusci-
tated Dupanloup,
Captain Stancfish, the 01100 clever man of tha
world who honoured tha Victorian Police by accept-
ing its Chief Commisaionership, died en Monday,
at the Melbourne Club, of which he had long been per-
haps the most prominent member. The Captain's
hair had grown white cf late years, ha had ho
longer been able to pace the block with his ac-
customed springy tread, and he had taken to
telling the same story twice over to the same listener
at short intervals. In other words, he had completely
broken down in health. He resigned the Chief Com-
miesionership, as an indirect consequence of the Ke’ly
reign of terror—though he, being a walking embodi-
menb of the Melbourne Club, went very nearly losing
his appointment during another reign of terror—not
Kelly's, but Berry’s. Captain Blandish knew at the
time that it had been decided to dismiss him—that
his name was included in the celebrated “ Suppressed
Gazette.” So he put on his hat and went to Sir George
Bowen, and said, “By Sir, if you sign my dismissal.
I’ll expose you so that the colony won’t be able to hold
you ” So, the Captain's dismissal was not signed.
The deceased gentleman was the second son of tha late
Mr. Charles Standish, of Standish Hall, Lancashire, a
“George the Fourth man,” and representative of one of
the oldest Roman Catholic families in England. Onhis
mother s side he was French, that lady having teen the
niece of the distinguished authoress and charming
letter-writer, the Coantc ss de Gonlis. Captain SI andish
was educaedat the Royal Military College of Wool-
wieh. where he passed a brilliant examination, and ob-
j tained in bis second yea* the number of marks required
for th 0 third year. He was then appointed to the Roy al
Artillery, in which corps he served for nhee years, during
throe of which be acted as Aide de camp to the celebra-
ted Marquis of Wellesley while Lord-Lieutenant of Ire
land. From evidence given tome years ago before a Par-
liamentary Committee on the Victorian Police Force it
appears that Captain Standish arrived in Melbourne
during the groat rush, as a steerage passenger, under
tha name cf “Frank Stanley,” and applied at the Rich-
mond depot for employment as a trooper. Tha circum-
stances which led to this change in his position aie
well known lo have been losses on the turf, inability to
meet his engagements on the Cheater Cup, and his
father's refusal to assist him The Duke cf Beaufort,
it is said, was willing to bolp, hut tho offer either was
declined or the matter could not be arranged. Refused
employment as a trooper, on the ground of there being
no vacancy, tho future Head of tne Force betook him-
eolf to noising at Pondigo j and while so engaged, met
in tho streets cf that canvps city cf 50 COO people hia
friend Lord Afred Churchill, who was then on a tour
to the colonies in his yacht the Wjvern. Through
this influence, an appointment of Warden of the Gold-
fields was obtained. Hia position in the Civil service
thus secured, he speedily chewed his ability, and re-
ceived tho appointment of Cbief Commissioror on
the resignation ot Captain, now "Sir Charles, MacMahon.
Captain Standish, ere the inevitable change came, was
an able administrator and the cleverest of diplomatists.
He was an excellent linguist, possessed rare powers of
conversation, and was in the Eurcpjan sense a
brilliant and accomplished man. Possessed cf a splen-
did physique and a most fascinating manner, he
for the last, thirty years figured as the most prominent
member cf Melbourne society; and as such it fell to his
lot to take a lead in the reception of euoh distinguished
visitors as the Duo de Penthievro and suite, the Prince
de Condd, and H,E H. theDuke of Edinburgh, in whose
little private expeditions through Melbourne Cup ain
Standish acted as ton camarade. The deceased, who
died of a complication of organic disorders, “lived”
every hour cf his life, and crowded into his 59 years mere
work and excitement than is experienced by balf-a-
dezsn ordinary men. At whist ho was facile princeps.
He was foremost among the votaries of tho turf, and
more then once occupied the honourable position of
chairman of the V.E C., to the secretariat cf which it
was thought ho would succeed when tho death of Mr.
Bagot was announced. But the Captain was no longer
capable of hard work, and so bo gave way to a more
vigorous man. He was a bachelor to the end.

It is stated that Lady Dixie, when attacked,
was walking i.i her grounds on the banks of the
Tuames, at Windsor. Th' assassins’ daggers twice
penetrated her clothing, but the blows failed through
sfct iking her corset. In endeavouring to protect her-
self Lady Dixie’s hands wore cut, otherwise she bus-
tained no injuries. S'10 fo'l fainting to the ground,

The attack rn Lady Dixie is said to be attributable

There are to be some novelties in the war of
dresses at the coming electrical exhibition at the West-
minister Aquarium. What do yon say to drosses the
trimmings of which are all effected by electric light ?
Ah, well, these are to be the commonest exhibits there.
The meohajjism of the thing is like this : Each dress
is embroidered with fine wires, connecting innumer-
able small incandescent lamps A main wire is carried
down to lha heel of the boot, which, coming into con-
feect with a prepared carpet or floor, is charged with
the electric current and the trimmings of the dress are
at once illuminated. It is intended to introduce there
dresses on the stage. We should think now it would

A TRAGEDY.
Act one: They walked in the Domain,
The lady and her bean.
Head sideways held, canary-like,
And whispered long and low.
He swore she was his idol, and
None others did ho know 5
She vowed he was the only man
She ever loved—just so 1
Act two : That night in the Domain,
Beneath the starlit sky.
Two other lovers strolled, and told
The same old sorry lie.
And squeeze for squeeze, and kiss for kisa
They gave, and sigh for sigh—
A phrase which is not ours so muoh
As Tom M lore's, by the bye.
Act throe: Those cooing couples met—
There was no wind of strife
Abroad, the waters were at rott.
Each tree slept oat its life—
When through their shade shot on the four
A moonbean like a knife ;
“ My husband! 1 ’ cried belle number one.
Beau number two “ My wife 1"

And bo the curtain falls.

Cut like a cameo.

A long hlaok fringe did fall.
We sat there spell-bound, like to him

We watched to see her smile.
At last there came a littla wave
Of laughter to her lips.
Which lighted up in manner brave
Her eye’s divine eclipse.
And slowly than she turned around—
The ushers saw us dash
Into the night with one wild bound •
Quick as the lightning-flash.

Well this is why—Alas I
She hadn’t one tooth in her head ;
Her other eye was glass.

Recently, in court, it was discovered that a
prisoner, who was being defended by Mr. Heydon, had
in his pocket one of the gifted barrister’s handker-
chiefs. When arraigned on this charge, the man ex-
plained that tho article had been given him by a oirons-
man to rise as a tent-fly. On closer examination Mr.
Heydon found this to be correct. What he is now look-
ing for is the circus.
An Indian correspondent writing to the Times
says that the Indian Civil Service is now mostly com-
posed of madmen, cranks, and half-and-half imbeciles,
and accounts for this happy state of things by laying
the blame at the door of the present system of over-
education. Our Civil Service could hardly flad such
an excuse if they wanted to. But they don’t want to.
They have no reason. Ah 1
Tho great sensation in Gunnedah is the band.

A poor old Presbyterian lady died the other day,
and the Howl obituarised her. Of course she went
straight to Heaven. The punishment of having one’s
obituary published in a religions paper is now generally
considered to be the real Hell. And, as the obitoary
only lasts whilst the paper on which it is printed con-
tinues to be capable of wrapping butter, this satisfac-
torily settles the question of eternal damnation.
“ Madame Modjeska is painting a picture for
the Paris Salon of 1881 The subject is an incident of
her own childhood.’' We know a man on the Bum who
drew an incident of his own childhood. It was a simple
interior, with a tonzled boy with a frightened face
devouring bread and dripping in tha foreground, bis
lower limbs concealed in a gunny bag, while an elderly
woman was at the window seating a juvenile pair of
pants with sail-oanvass and rope-yarn.
She was a girl with a ready wit. The two were
alone in a railway carriage, when he began to exhibit
osoulatory propensities. "I’ll throw myself out of
the window 1" she cried. " If you do you’ll be
butchered,’’ said the man who was inclined to bo giddy.
“ Better be Butchered than Baket’d," was the reply.
Much struck with this reply, he apologised, and recon-
ciliation was effected. But no, dear reader. They
weren’t wedded. Bhe gave him in obarge at tho next
station.
Now it’s all over, Brown, and Jones, and Smith
“ really never believed in that storm business of
Wiggins—scouted the idea, you know, from the oom.
menoement." Yet each ef them had thought it ad-
visable to postpone for * week that little sea-trip to
Melbourne. Archbishop Vaughan’s departure was jut
off, it is said—either on account of Wiggins, cr to
allow of further subscriptions conning in from tho
faithtnl. And it is a solemn fact that a lot of Dubbo
yokels so far believed in Wiggins, LL D , that they
actually chained down their huts.
Bibbs says the N.S.W. Marine Board is not
entitled to confidence. Yes it is. It is entitled in en
eminent degree to the confidence of all shark-like ship-
owners, proprietors of rotten colliers, broken-down
steam launches, patohed-up harbour steamers, and so
on. But it’s not entitled to the confidence of the poor
devil who commits an error of judgment at sea, and
has a wife and family to keep on shore. The present
Marine Board should be wiped out in one aot. So
should soma of tho marine surveyors. An independent
report on certain vessels now running in our beautiful
harbonr, and oat of it, would result in a lot of things.
A Kanaka boy, who has six toes on each foot,
six fingers on his left and seven on his right hand, and
three tongues, has been born ou the Ra coast of Fiji.
When he grows up, he’ll no doubt be employed by the
Customs as a liquor-taster ; and when, ia the exercise
of that profession he gets foud of grog, and determines
on entering Parliament, there’ll be a busy time for the
undertakers. Imagine Buchanan or Taylor with three
tongues I Babel would in comparison have been a mere
Deaf and Dumb Asylum. And, if you can, imagine
certain members of Parliament —“ compensation" mem-
oers—with seven fingers each, and the lid of the

An art union was held np in Cooma the other
day. When the night for drawing the prizes came
round, the proprietor of the shew announced that he
was £38 short of ths amount necessary to make the
thing pay, and accordingly wished to postpone the
drawing, or deduct prizes to that value. The audience
having howled their disapproval of either course, some-
one suggested that he (the proprietor) thould keep tho
“ other prizes” which were specified on the tickets as
“ too numerous to mention," and let the drawing go
on. And then it turned out that these “ other prizes ”
were a packet of envelopes 1 The proprietor is as well
as can be expected.
Amongst the fourteen fined -£5 each for being in a
gambling-hell at Bonrke, three were aldermen. Now
the municipal law at Bourke is that tho M yor and two
aldermen form a quorum. One of the speculative
aldermen fined only escaped being elected Mayor by a
casting vote. Had he been chosen, could not a point
have been raised by these gamblers in the cellar that
thoy were merely attending a municipal meeting ?
Bonrke is the town described some years ago by Sir
John Robertson as “ that place 3C0 miles the other side
of Hell." Since the cellar-gambling exposd, the three
worthy aldermen and their friends may veritably bo
said to have gone down to Gehenna.
The latest about Milner Stephen ia that he has
magnetised a cork leg. He also effected a wonderful
cure in the case of a deaf boy. After being blown on,
he was taken by his father to a place near (he one
o’clock gun. Then, watch in hand, the father told the
boy to listen, and tell him what he heard. Bang ! want
the piece of ordnance, with a reverberation that shook
every window within five miles. Then the son was
loyous. “ Hurray, pa,” he cried. *'I heard your
watch tick once quite plainly.” Now when the fond
Earent calls on Milner, that wonderful half-healer drags
is chest of drawers against the hotel-door, and shrieks
out to the waiter to say he is dead.
i The Bum acknowledges a slight error. Mr.
I Slattery’s speech on the Wolverene question in the
month of Mr. Stuart! That’s all. This sort of thing
is of such frequent occurrence in the little Melbourne
rag that, if Sir Henry Parkes is credited with a few
remarks, attribute them at once to M'Elhone; the
speeches of Cooaan to Abigail, and the orations of
Fromiin to O’Mara. That will be the best way. No
one can expect (with justice) the Bum to even know our
legislators by sight; so, therefore, its mistakes, poor
thing, are not so deserving of censure as it would at first
appear. But there I On some points the Bum could
never err. As to the price of saveloys, for instance; or
the name of a cheap half-sole-and-beeler.
ON THE BEINK.
’Twas night—the air was cold and damp.
The sky was overcast.
When lo, behold, a female tramp
Pled on with footsteps fatt.
On, on she flew; the wharf was nigh;
Quick rushed the murky flow ;
She passed and heaved a low sad sigh—
And silent gazed below.
And as towards the wharf’s dark brink,
She in the blaok night stole;
A voice rang ont—” Stop—don’t you think
You’re going to shake my coal."
The Cologne people didn’t like an opera singer,
a native of the town, who had juat returned covered
with honours from the States, so ” gave him the
straight griffin.” Theypafsedto him on the stage a
carpet bag and a miniature ship. We all remember the
time when the Scotch residents of Sydney—w,th Dr.
Lang at the head, and David Buchanan at the tail-
presented Eochefort, the Communist, with a walking-
stick on his arrival here. It was done in sober earnest,
bat tbe affair was looked upon as the hugest joke since
ths Deluge, and regarded as the result of Scotch denes-
ness. Now, if we wanted (say) a bush miseimary to
clear, we merely show him a boot. In the country, say
®n a station, it would be different. We’d then show
him an empty moat-safe, or meet him at tbe slipraila and
ask him for a shilling for the poor, or for the Looard.
The new liquor-law in Copenhagen must be
very popular witn tte publicans there. One of its pro-
visions is that “a drunken per.on is to bo conveyed to
his own dwelling in a oab or covered carriage at ths
expense of the landlord in whose bouse ho took tbe
last glass ” This is a very good hint to our legislators
when they are considering the Licensing Act Amend-
ment Bill. We think it might be amplified' so that
the landlord should be compelled to supply any man,
whom he had sent homo drunk, with soda water next
day, and al-o with a bundle of temperance tracts. And
next tiumthe man cams into bis bar he should be ma Is
to administer the pledge to him. There is nothing
like being thorough. We suppose those provisions
will yet be emb idled in our Licensing Aot, and if they
are, how many carriages will the Parliamentary caterer
have to provide ?
We observe that Alfred has come out with a
new story—“ Diane, or the Plotters of Poiotiers, by
Sylvanus Cobb." We suppose Sylvauus Cobb is Aus-
tralian for Alexandre Dumas, since the following
passage appears —
“ • Ah i * interrupted tne woman, with an un-
wonted sparkle in her eye; • and I know for why
Pierre Latonohe was sent into Germany. It was to
carry letters to—’
“ * —ah. The walls may hare ears.’
“ ‘—to Cardinal Mazrrin,’ finished Junon, in a
whisper. And then she added, still iu a guarded
tone, ' I am not a fool, papa. I knew what I
know.’ ”
Our old friend the Dock de Sc. Armong also figures j
and. doubtless, Joels will be to the fore shortly. We
shall observe with interest what sort of a literary back
will make this Cobb. “Ah, Murry, Murry I Mar
farm eet mart.”
Things were very dull coming home from Botany
on Saturday last. The good old Milesian spirit seemed
to havo bseu starved out of most of tbe boys out there
by a leng sojourn under Australian suns. Coming
homo on the trams, thing ■ wore even gloomier than
they were out on the ground. Soma few attempted to
give a little vivacity to the effuir by faintly jeering a
passing Chinaman, but their efforts were received with
chilling silence. At length a pugnaoious-faced Irish-
man, with patriotic teeth—they were green—who had
bean working himself up all the way, jumped to his
feet and yelled out: “Is there any wan here wants to
fight P If he does, bo me sowl I’m the man fur’m 1
Come an now 1” A pause. “ Fwhat, will nobody come
an ?” As he saw that nobody was making any sign of
accepting his generous offer, he sat down gloomily and
said, half to himself and half aloud, in the bitterest
inflection of scorn his tongue could manage : “ Not wan
fight I Not as muoh as get!iu’ wan lick at the head of a
man the whole time I And they call this 8b Pa! brick’s
Day 1 Why, in the ould oounthry there wouldn't be a
family wid any claims to daoonoy for miles and miles
around that wouldn’t have a funeral av their own afther
sioh a day as this I God bless ould Ireland 1” he mur-
mured affectionately; “ If ye can raise nothin’ else, ye
can always raise a fight there.”
Wo had been wondering for some time where
our old friend Harold Stephen had gone, and had tear-
fully concluded some outraged reader of his stories
had killed him and hidden his bedy in a water-butt,
when we came across him once more in a Victorian
country paper. Thera was no mistaking the style. The
same old harmless vacuity, tho same old simpering
soheolgirlish sentimentality, which were always his
characteristics, stand out at us in every line. No other
hand but Harold Stephen’s could have penned such
aggravatiugly inoffensive imbecilities aewere contained
in this article. Ib was about Prank Weston, and de-
scribed Harold’s first meeting with Frank in Beech,
worth. ” Wo fraternised at once,” he remarks, and
then, jauntily, “more cocktails were ordered.” Oh,
Harold, you desperate dog I And then comes a lot
more, winding up with the statement that Frank has a
nice bouse in a Melbourne suburb, and that “if there
were more sneb houses and such men in Australia, life
would be a trifle easier to many a struggling artist,
actor, md author.” So it might ; and proportionately
batter to many a natural-born tripe-soller, bricklayer,
and milkman who had missed their vocations. Take
this little moral to heart, Harold; Everyman counts
for what he is worth. It is Emersonian, and will wear
well. We know a number of men who count for
nothing.?

David Buchanan says cricket is being degraded
into a low moan device by which degraded individuals

There is a letter lying in the Wagga Post Office

They are going to erect another bath at Manly

In the West Melbourne Presbyterian Church,

Last week several Chinamen brought in a sum
of money, which they and their countrymen had sub.
scribed for the building of a ohuroh in Ooulburn, to
the Bishop of that diocese. It was accepted—of course.
Nothing is said as to whether the Chinese subscribers
ware Christians or not. It was of no consequence,
anyhow. It the money had been subscribed by blind
i on’s dogs or hangmen's clerks, it would have bsen
t aken just as cheerfully. Tne glory of God recognises
no distinctions. Aud the glory of God is a good dinner
—with a bottle of crusty old port afterwards.
Lord Wolseley seems to be a bit of a fool. Writ-
ing to the head-master of a national school in England,
be said : “ Had I begun life as a tinker, my earnest en-
deavour would have been to have made better pots and
pans than my neighbours." This was for the tdlfloa-
lion of (he boys, of course, aud would have sounded
well if it had come from tho First Napoleon, but from
I,ord Wolseley—ah ! If Lord Wolseley had been a
tinker bo would have remained a tinker nil his life. As
is is, his achievements have been tinpot enough to sug-
gest the idea that ha is in reality a tinker’s changeling.
Aud these are the sort of things which ?re set np for
hero-worship now-a-days.
Her Gracious Majesty the Queen — we’re sorry
to hear of her having made, however slight, a faux pas
at her venerable age—is an exceedingly good lady.
When she is not making flannel petticoats with her own
Royal hands for the old women around Baltseral, she is
pottering about distributing Bibles among them. This
reminds ns that she was lately presented with a photo,
graph of a Bible whioh had saved the life of a private
iu the 74th Regiment at Tel-el-Kebir. It was in his
breast-pocket, and was pierced with a Remington
ballet. A bullet respects a pious man—but it doesn’t
mem to have much reverence for the Holy Book. Now,
a profane person might say that the ‘ Age of Reason" or
a pack of cards would have beea just as eflioaoious in
»• topping the ballet. Very likely they woul*, but—
snd here is where we have such scoffers on the hip—
this pious soldier didn't happen to carry them. And if
you want to know why he didn’t carry them, it was
because they hadn’t leather backs. His Bible had a
leather back. It was a good razor-strop.
There’s another petition on foot for the release
of Bertrand, who killed Kinder, of the City Bank, many
years ago, because ha (Bertrand) loved Mrs. Kinder.
Bertrand only escaped the gallows on a legal quibble.
The murder was not done in tho heat of passion, but
was a cold-blooded and deliberate one, and was perpe-
trated in pursuance of a plan whioh had been agreed
upon by the actual murderer and Mrs. Kinder. There
was not a single extenuating fact iu tho whole affair
from beginning to end. It isn’t because the memory of
tbo general public concerning tho event has grown
hazy—because Bertrand is a pretty well-connected aud
< x jeedingly well-educated criminal—that ho should now
be let off. T hare arc dozens of men in gaol for fifteen
years or for life, for comparatively venial offences, who
must, if justice is to be done, be released should the gaol-
door bo now opened for this eminent husband shooter.
Tho blood of Uriah has not yet been atoned for. We
had all bettor regard Mr. Bertrand as having been
hanged long ago; and Mr. Bertrand had better reflect
that half a loaf is better than no bread, and felicitate
himself on having narrowly escaped tho hangman. It
is a pity, however, that the effects of a son’s villainy
should be felt by the poor old mother who so unceas-
ingly toils on in the hope that the rascal may obo day
bo free.
The funniest thinjr we have heard of for some
lime —barring, of course, the holy war in tho Synod—isln
civil war iu a Victorian country newspaper office. The
two partners in the concern seem to have had a quarrel,
and the leading article is devoted to the recounting of
the sorrows of one, while the eab-loador ventilates the
woes of the other. We can fancy two starving men
quarreling over a crust ef bread, but wo can’t fancy
two strong men quarrelling over nothing. Consequently
we consider tho conduct of those journalists unreason-
able. Ono of thorn, however, is somewhat funny : —
"As to my real grievances,” he says, “they will have
to remain dormant—until I become old—and then,
when I want to read something about bad men. I may,
perhaps, peruse them.” The only honourable course
open for the settlement of this dispute is, as far as we
oan see, for one of the disputants to challenge the
other to a duel with threepenny-bits. As the weapon#
would not bo forthcoming, of course it would bo a
drawn light, and each man would retire upon his lau-
rels. Or, if they wanted to be mere decisive still, one
might frighten the other to death with the sight of a
Half-crown—lent by the local publican, an! watched
by a bulldog, for the occasion—and then the survivor
could bs hanged for murder at the next assizes. This
is the most final way of setting tho feud at rest that we
oan think of just now, and probably it will be the most
acceptable to tho subscribers to the bisected bladder
of which these two little tarantu’ra are the pro-
prietors
It is notified by the wise men of our fossilized
Telegraph Department that in (utpre persons living at

what the value of the mtsrage is ? Our telegraphs will

Any man who thinks he can have a little joke
all to himself whenever he cheeses, had better not go
np to Townsville T hey are a solid people up there.
It a man fools with them oaoo ho never tries it a second
time Everything in Townsville must be done on the
square. If you lead them to believe you are going to
dip, then you’ve got to die and keop dead. A case in
point occurred the other day. A man fell down in a fit
on the Townsville beach This was in the morning.
The doctor was called and gave him some medical
assistance, and he went away. That afternoon the
>odyw.;s found on the beach, and was proutunced by
tho game doctor to bo the man ho had attended iu tho
morning. He was buried tho next day. Here is where
the itch cornea in. The man who had the fit in tho
D'orcing-, and who according to all testimony wasf jund
dead in tho afternoon, and buried on tbo follow-
ing day, wsa roen walking about tho streets of the
town net two hours after ho was “planted" He as-
icrteddhat it was another man who had been found
d. a i, but of course this was too palpable an attempt to
palm himself oil as a living man to be listened to for a
raiment. Tho doctor who had attended him, and cer-
tified to his identity with the corpse naturally con-
sideted J,he faot of his gadding around the town when
he ought to be in his grave as a reflection upon him
{the doctor) in his professional capacity, aud wrote to
the local Journals accordingly. We quote the con-
eluding lines of his letter :—" This morning I saw this
man (the man who was inqnested and buried) sitting
on U'Grath’s verandah. Now, sir, I would a»k, is it
a decent or proper thing that a dead n.an should be
allowed to walk about the streets of this young and
thriving town, and to sit on M'Orath’s verandah?
Hswever, the duty of the authorities is clean The
man must be arrested and buried again," Whion
leads us to repeat that a man of very volatile humour
hae no business in Townsville.
FISH-PONDS FKOZEN.
The Echo baa evidently chartered one of Alfred’s
poets. Just stop and ’oar ’im ’owl
“ The fairest fl owars oft scentless are,
And I could name a dozen
Fair women, bright a a Venus’s star.

This bird, as a profound explorer of the bathos, treads
oloso upon the bluchers of ttladen. But come—
We cannot stand this sort of stuff,
Or.r feelings>t does wring;
Have not we suff'rers had enough
Of this dread kind of thing ?
We’ve ainn'd, perohnnoe, in many parts.
But even this supposin'.
Why quite break our half-broken hearts
With “ cold as fish-ponds frozen ?”
We’ve clung to life—yes, tightly clung ;
We’ve loved poetio lore j
But, fearsome bard, now thou hast sung
We wish to live no more 1
Bo, order round our cherry-case,
And double us inside;
And write —” Ose of a noble race
Of fish-ponds frozen" died.
It waa a branch of the Lord’s vineyard in
Queensland, where Labourer Brown had worked for
some years, and it was towards the oloso of shearing.
The “boys" on the neighbouring stations wore hard at
it earning money for the landlord of the “ Dead Finish,"
and the girls—those of them who hadn’t swum the
river and gone back on Christianity—were all in the
stockade learning verses, when Labourer Brown found
he had to drive down to the Point on mission work
Hi* bones were full of corn, so he took sable Kitty to
sit in the bngey and mind them, as he didn’t care to
trust in Providence too implicitly when the mokep had
bean having such a long spell. All went well until the
Point was gained, and thou I abourer Brown went over
the shining river, leaving Kitty in the buggy on the
hither side. Now, it befell that at the hotel hard by,
oertiin sons of Belial were offering sacrifice to their
gol Bacchus, and rum lay around loose. The wor-
shippers soon spotted Kitty and saw an opouing for
wholesome fun; so they called her over. "Baal,”
replied the lady, virtuously, "Ole Brown come
along a this one, an’ plenty yabbor sposen I
go.” 11 Oh 1 that be — anything. Come an’ have
some rum, Kitty," urged the sons of B., persuasively
holding up a bottle. Negotiations followed, and at
last Kitty—saying she would ne’er consent —consented.
Human nature is but weak. After one nip, Kitty, for-
gotiing her absent pastor, gave way to temptation, and
in halt an hour waa as drunk as one of the 35. In the
midst of a oorrobboree of the most can-can character,
which the elated child of grace wav executing amid the
applause of the delighted shearers and whalers.
Labourer Brown returned, and gazed aghast. “ Kitty,”
exclaimed the reverend man, in horror, " what means
this ?” Bat Kitty can-can’d continuously on, " Come
away this moment, Kitty, and go in the buggy,” cried
ho, desperately- "Go along a buggy, damphool you,
too,” retorted the rum-valiant Christian, ‘‘ baal mine
pull away f’om publikouse. Gib it nuther cobbler you."
"Eight yon are : hare’s a rum, old girl," said another
son of B. And then Labourer Brown made a fatal
mistake. Seizing the arm of the dusky backslider, he
endeavoured to •ompel her obedience; but Satan and
Queensland rum were too powerfully at work, and amid
shrieks of delight from the assembly, she tore awav
the holy man’s cassock, and went on her way to the
devil, rejoicing ; while the trembling servant of the
Lord drove home alone, and was so agitated that he
forgot to pray for the backslider. These are the trials
of missionary life in the Australian wilds, and they may
aooount for the reluctance of English divines to accept
our vacant Bishoirio.
It was down on the Darling River. He waa a
young, lithe-limbod ecion of a hundred sable kings, and
stalked proudly upon his native soil full of hope and
promise and baked ’possum and rum. It was a dream
too fair to last. The bush missionary came and blighted
his life as lightning blasts the forest monarch, or a
potato-bug the pride of Warrnambool. Previous to
the arrival of this bird of evil, he had lived a happy
life, made up of alternate bouts of glorious gluttony
and sunny drunkenness. The bnsh missionary changed
all that. He blessed him, cursed him, entreated him,
threatened him, and threw him into three consecutive
convulsions of terror every ten minutes. Life at last
became a lurid nightmare to this unfortunate savage
Bo one day he asked the missionary where he (the mis-
sionary) would go to when ho died. The holy man
replied that he lived in joyous confidence of going to
heaven. " And where will I go when I die P” he con-
tinued. “ You will go to heaven, also, if you are good "
" And will I meet yon there ?” "Certainly.” "And
whare will I go if 1 till myself?” "You will go to
bell ” That, day the sable convert drowned himself in
the river. He had made up his mind to bo free from
missionaries in the next world, even if he had to go to
hell to escape them —which shows what an unsophisti-
cated creature he waa. Hell is the last place we should
think of going to if we wanted to be rid of missionaries
Immediately the poor nigger jumped into the water, an
alarm was given to the police, and one of the constables
lounged leisurely down to the river back, lazily puffing
a cigar. Then he carefully rolled up his starched shirt-
sleeves, making sure ho didn’t crease them in the opera-
tion. It would never do to jeopardise the dignity of
the 11 fooroe" by any unseemly haste. (It is a peculiar
thing, that as soon as some ignorant pig-headed bo$-
trotter is supplied by the State with the first clean suit
of clothes he ever had on him in his life, he begins to
get haughty, and to talk about "dignty." This ia
irrelevant of course, but we thought wo would say it as it
happened to strike us). Quite a number of people
assembled ou the banks to witne r. the constable's grace-
ful nonchalance and easy indifference of movement.
They thought ho was born that way, but, bless it
was the result of long study and consummate art.
This exhibition took up about a quarter ef an hour,
during whieh time the blackfellow’s life might have
been saved, if it had been of any consequence. But it
wasn’t, and so his body waa not fished up till three days
after. Then the fun began. A ciffia was got to bury
it in, but the coffin was too eh rt. A humourist in the
crowd soon settled this. Ho jumped on the shoulders
of the corpse and forced it down endwise Then
another difli mlty cropped up—they couldn’t screw on
the lid. A couple of jokers standing by immediately
jumped ou the lid and danced a jig upon it, while the
others were screwing it down. This is said to have been
a most amusing sight. Then the procession began.
Tho mourners stopped at every public-house—leaving
the ocffln in the middle of the street At last they got
so festive that they very nearly forgot it altogether,
and when the bearers did take it up the whole affair
looked like a huge centipede, which was weak in the
knees, but yot determined to crawl away somehow. At
last they planted tim, aud in doing so, very nearly
buried two of the bearers But there never was such
fun at a funeral before. We should liketo go up on the
Dor ing Kiver for about six months. We should liko to
start business there —as hangmen.

Another injustice to Oiroland ! Out of tho ten
members who compose the present Victorian Ministry
there are six Englishmen, two Scotchman, one Corn-
stalk and only one Irishman, and even that one is from
the North. This Ministry, by the way, appears to have
aot itself disliked already. Mr. Deakin, it is said, was
appointed Minister for Water Supply because words
fliw fiom him like water through a pump; and it is
thought Mr. Berry will be berry little uf« to Mr.
Service, and Mr. Service very little service to Mr.
B „ rrv- Lastly, the whole Cabinet has been happily
termed tha “ Ministry of Misfits." We could point out
a few square pigs in round holes amongst our own con-
stellation, bus all things wUl find their proper level
B °When Mr. Gregsbury, M.P. (to whom Nicholas
Niokleby applied for a billet), was on the hustings, he
signified hia intention of “ playing the very devil with
everything," and yet he was bought over by 'hang
atkod with his wife to aa evening party by a political
magnate. Well, there would seem, somehow, to be a
good deal of the Gregsbury element in the Ministry j
for, after all their talk, they are all Parkes a
items like steam—Wolverene, included. Garbett is not
to the fore just at present, but we should not bo sur-
prised to hear that even his magnanimous ctt'ir was
still under consideration. Nor would wo be surprised
wre tho Dawes Point Exchange swindle to be worked
out Nothing would surprise us now. But nothing has
over surprised us very much.
From the D.T. of 15th:—“We are informed
that tho Messrs. Eedmond are not to be invited to the
banquet on St, Patrick’s Day, and we have to oompli-
ment the committee on the good sense they have shown
Of course, those gentlomoa may be present, but they
will not be there in any official capacity, and their
presence will, therefore, bo no imputation upon tho
loyalty of the gathering." Now, where do you think
this greasy inspired paragraph came from ? Doesn't it
read as if it had been written with a meat-skower
behind a curtain ? Wasn’t it obviously printed in order
to pave the way for a certain political trimmer attend-
ing tbe banquet? But who now has the verdict of
popular sentiment —the outspoken, resolute (even if
altogether mistaken) Eedmond, or the accommodating
blatherskite who used once to command the columns
of tho Evening News, but who now has descended to
the level of his prototype-in-journalism, the Bum ?
Mr. A. G. Taylor is a genuine humorist. He
never laughs at his own jokes. His now historic
“ apology ” was delivered in an absolutely monotonous
voice. Whenever ho moved his arms it was semaphore
fashion, when the house giggled his brow seemed to
darken somewhat, and when it jelled with laughter
“the Giraffe” looked “as solemn as a boiled owl."
David Buchanan also appears to bo a humorist. When
ha asseverated that he bad never boeu drunk iu the
Assembly, honourable members simply shrieked —why,
wo suppose the-public will never know. “ If drink bad
buy rifeot upon him it was to improve him," therefore
“he was a strict absolute teetotaler for 14 years."
What a pity! How great is the loss to New South
Wales 1 Howeisily “ the Wrongs of Ireland " might
have been righted, and how eloquently the poliov of
Fren-trade might have been advocated usque ad hodie
mim diem!! Apropos, David has said nothing of iate
about “ the Wrongs of Ireland." He used to be in-
tensely democratic, and therefore intensely “ disloyal.’’
The Eedmond controversy, strangely enough, hasn’t
brought him out of his shell. Will he yet emerge, and
add to his collection one more " Specimen of Australian
Oratory I'*—and, if so, will ho turn his back upon his
former self? Or will he, like the Sawdust Dictator,
class among his youthful follies all such fl ! ghts of
oratory as accord with “Murmurs of tha Stream ?’’
We read that “ The first batch of tho Khe-
dive’s ‘fctar’ was to be issued to Her Majesty’s forces
at the end of February.” To touch even a bauble from
the polluted hands of so filthy a creature as Tew fit,
onr Bailiff in, Egypt, will be a degradation to any
soldier with a spark et manhood. Vanity Fair, the
most conservative of English journals—the organ of
the aristocracy, in fact —publishes a portrait and bio-
graphy of the Khedive, who looks the tbiag he is— a
mean, cowardly hound, born but to beget idiots and
fatten on the misery of a people. Thus Yasiiy Fair : —
* Tewfik, Khedive and Puppet, is atill groping in a fog,
with the hope of finding somebody to lean up in. During
his brief reign his allegisftice and his intrigues have
pretty equally alternated between tho Sultan, Sir
Edward Malot, the Baron de Eing, Ctdrif Pacha, Eiaz
Pacha. 1 mon oher Mahmoud Samy,' and Ahmed Araby;
hut neither one nor tho other of his friends oould trust
hia resolution for ten consecutive minutes. On the
10th July, 1882, ho solemnly determined in Council at
Alexandria that • if the English fired five shots the
Egyptians should reply to the tiro, and that God, the
best of all judges, must judge between the English
and tho Egyptians;’ but, aftersonding constant mestagf s
et encouragement during the bombardment, he crept, 24
hours later, into the English lines. After ten days'
delay, and mn.ih intrigue with bo h parties heoffi dally
dismissed Arabi under pre.-sure,‘ tet net having offered
a more efficient resistance to the English troops; but
he admitted to Lord Charles Beresford that he had
mounted gleefully enough the terrace of his palace at
Eimleh to witness the rumoured sinking of an English
ironclad. Having been brought back to Cairo by a
victorious army of ‘ mandataries,’ one would naturally
f xpeot him to lean entirely on the counsel, advice, and
support ol Lord Duifetin. Par from this being the
his chief object now seems to ba to find a means
pi counteracting English infinance, and securing an
imaginary freedom by pulling the Powers by the eirs
Everyone who has been a week in Egypt finds out that
Meheuiet Tewfik is tho beat hated and most despised
man in the country. He will reign exactly an long as
British or other ‘ mandatory ’ troops guard his palace,
and not an hour longer. If he is left behind ua nothing
o»n save him from tho fate of his nude Abbas. Me-
J-.cmet Tewfik has always been.u sort of political leaning
tower of Pisa; he is destined to end as a political
Tmmpty Dumpty."
Mr. Buchanan delivered a thundering and
nt’ctive philippic, chiefly directed against the S. At
•Uerai. d,in the Assembly on Tuesday night. Ha said
ineto was not a solitary Christian, man s.r woman, who
y ,?°t P ero °ivo a flourish malice pervading every line
u Iterald’s raport cf Mr. Copeland's speech at
: 16 i3t - Patrick's Day banquet. Iu the fact that not
one word of Sir Patrick Jennings’ admirable speech
vas reported iu that journal, while Mr. Copeland’s
moohoranoiea were given verbatim, was seen a glimpse
oi t no super human malignity of, he was going tossy,
i f v l\ n vflio elbowed publicity to the proceedings,
rr 1 did his very utmost to bring contumely and ruin
.’’°u a follow-man, whoso conduct he (Mr. Buchanan)
could not defend, but with whose misfortune he deeply
“jmpa'ypeed. The pres* of England would never have
identified itself, under such circumstances, with n re-
port having nothing to recommend it but the flendibh
malignity of an indescribable wretch. Ho was not on
speaking terms with Mr. Copeland, concerning whom
he had fearlessly expressed his opinion ; but when he
found that Mr. Copeland had been a victim t j ench a
combination, which had aimed at bringing about his
political ruin, any feeling he had against him was
turned into the warmest sympathy. There were
men, conspicuous in the religious world of Sydney, who
had figured in the Insolvent Court in a light that
branded them as orimina's, but did they aver get a
word from this paltry hypocritical journal? There
wore churchwardens of suuh a stamp over whom the
Herald had carefully thrown a protesting cloak—this
Herald, which was upheld by a parcel of broken-dowa
parsons, who cou'.d not make a living in the pulpit, and
who never hesitated to soil their Master and his princi-
ples for the miserable mess of pottage they got from a
rich proprietary, and who thought it clever to malign
and abuse public men who made au insignificant slip.
He trusted that Mr Copsland would not resign. If
they read the Herald’s article, they would think Mr.
Copeland bad committed a dr zin murders; yet this
paltry act of drunkenness was the whole of tne elf ance
at which thesa Botany Bay saints hud turned up their
eyes in pious horror. This unfortunate man—full of
generous instincts, intelligence, hard-working and
respectable—happened on this solitary occasion to have
exceeded the bounds of propriety, and yet they found
him written absut as if ho had run the gauntlet of
every conceivable crime. Where in the name of Christ
was their religious charity ? When did they see the
Herald leading the van in r xposing corruption in high
places ? The press of New South Wales derived hap-
pines?, comfort, and satisfaction from the fall of men
in public hfe. The broken-down parsons of whom he
had spoken wore actuated by private malice. Mr.
Copeland's misfortune was the merest slip. There was
iu his speech nothing disloyal—not a single senti-
ment that any one could object to, and the
delinquency of the Minister for Works was that he
went into the society of the most convivial gentlemen
one could meat—namely, Irishmen—where whisky and
everything else was circulated with a rapidity almost
eleotrio, and under these circumstances, after having
spent the whole day in amusement, ho went to tbe
banquet, got a little overcome, and spoke a little non-
sens*. That was the head and fi ont of bis offending,
and the gravity of the crime reduced to its proper
dimensions. He hoped for the sake of the Government,
tbat Mr. Copeland, who vu a practical man of strong
intelligence, would not resign, for very small was the
delinquency to bring about so terrible a sacr.iice —
Other members also spoke, Mr. Garrett, who followed
in a strain similar to that cf Mr. Buohaaan, remarking
among other things, that Mr. Copeland—who had lately
been engaged three times in hard-fought contested e!eo-
tions, and had since been engaged in the performance
of duties that would down half a dozen men—
was, an hour and a half before the dinner, perfectly
sober and responsible. He would like to know how
bon members would look if what they stated in that
House wes reported verbatim by the press, and with
the tame particularity as the speech of Mr. Copeland.
They would look just as foolish. With regard to the
subjects dealt with in Mr. Copeland s speech, they
wore all good points from Mr Copeland s point of
view, and in that part of his speech whe:e he was
allowed to proceed without interruption he was co-
herent enough. • Let any sensible man take up the
speech and out out the interjections and interruptions,
and he would fiud that it read coherently enough. Ho
had no doubt whatever that the impatience of certain
persons to hear Mr. Redmond led to the interruptions
• • •
From a report of M’Elhone’s address to the
eUotcra of Muigeo:—An interruption occurred by a
person iu the body of the hall. Mr. M'Elhono imme-
diately pounced on the man interrupting him, and
exclaimed in an impassioned manner: “ This man that
is row interrupting me waited upon me at my hotel
and promised he would support me in this election,
and then borrowed ten shillings from me. If this is
a specimen of the Mudgee voters, then for Gad’s sake
lot them vote for Taylor." (Roars of laughter.)
Inspector Seymour seized 21 boxes of rotten eggs the
other day. They had just arrived from Melbourne.

hit him, in the words of a religious newspaper, “on
the chops.” Prior Butler, in his fddross at Mel-
bourne on St. Patrick’s Day, principally dealt with the
questions whether Ireland bad a destiny, aud what that
destiny was. In reference to one of the reasons ad-
vanoed aga’nst Ireland being a separate nation—namely,
tbat she was too small—he maintained that the reason
was an insufficient cue, as Qrceco.a yet smaller country,
had done m me for the civilisation of the world than
any other nationality. His opinion was that Ireland
must, in the long run, become a separate nation. Bung!
...In various parts of the colony meetings “ to protest

When we read the cablegram about the at-

Lots of people fondle dogs. In tho saliva, of
the dog is tue germ of the deadly hydatid, which ia
Australia annually claims hundreds of victims. The
other day an eminent doctor examined ton dogs which
had been poisoned with prussic acid ia a Melbourne
suburb. In all these were hydatids. Anyone who has
seen a gallon or two ot pus drawn from a hydatid
tumour iu tho human subject would probably refrain
from allowing a dog to liok him, or from drinking out
of any vessel to which a dog has access. A ‘piece of
liver casually picked up is found to have a hydatid
cyst, consisting simply of a large white bladder, in
which the animal lives. A dog oats the liver, and im-
mediately becomes infected with innumerable ova,
which develop, not into hydatid, as in sheep, but into
a small kind of tapeworm. These parasites have three
sacs of vascular tissue, one of which contains hundreds
of eggs. To swallow one of these eggs is death for the
human being. The insect ditisolveu its shell imme-
diately on entering the stomach, and tho embryo, now
furnished with sis wiry tentacles, works its way to the
nearest blood-voesol, and, by aid of the circulation,
roaches tho liver or some other internal organ. Once
there, it forms a cyst, whore the breeding ot a much
larger animal proceeds apace. When you see Ponto
licking the baby, think ot all this.

The fight t«ok place in tho Melbourne Sportsman, in
plaoo of a 24 feet ring, and Miller got all the bast of it.
Hioken refused to box, but wanted to fight Miller,
knowing well that the heavy-weight would not meet
him. for, as Miller truly says, ho is an athlete, and not
a prize-fighter. If Hioken could not thrash Miller
boxing, he would probably have a worse show in the
ring, whore Millet’s wrestling would oome in. If Abe
is anxious - for a fight we might find something about his
own weight in Sydney. Foley might oblige him.

The Ed ward a-O’Leary six days’ walk came to a
conclusion at a quarter to cloven on Saturday night.
Ti e Australian covered 373, and tho stangor 350 miles.
It was stated that the latter was unwell during the con.
test, and this mast account for tho poor show made, as
ho has covered 600 miles in nearly all his big matches
On Saturday night O’Leary looked as fresh as when he
started, but Edwards seemed upon his last legs. So
that there isn’t the slightest reason for the Australian
rooster to perch on his own dunghill and flip his wings
Long distance pedestrianism and its entourage are bad
enough at their vrry boat. The Eiwards-O’Leary
match was a wretched fiasco. If O’Leary can’t do
better than 330 miles in si* days, there are scores of
bushitian who’ll Walk his head off. Ditto with respeot
to his spindle-sllanked, bauble-covered friend.
W. G. George gave the following opinion of
Myers to one of nis interviewers :—" For tho half-mile
I was in splendid trim, and although fresh at tho finish
I could not go the pace, and felt wild to see Myers
quietly looking over* his shoulder at mo all tho way
down the straight. The mile was an ea’y race I only
let myself ont of my ordinary pace once, av.d that was
ill the last lap, and it won mo the race. The three-
quarters was the most gruelling race I have ever run,
and my best performance over there. Along one straight
the wind was so strong that I had to struggle against
it to get any pace on at all, and it seemed to pierce one
through. The time, 3 min 10)seo , I am satisfied was
qnito equal to my 3 min. 4soc, trial, ns the path was
very rotten I was quite run out when I turned into
the straight for the last time, and quite expected to be
beaten, as Myers was within two yards of me, and I
was prepared for him to rush by any moment Had be
done so, I could not have pat in ano - her yard to have
saved my life; I candidly own I waa clean run out."
The first Annual Regatta of the Balmain
Mechanics' R iwing Club came off on Saturday last.
The affair was mismanaged all through. Programmes
were distributed gratis on the steamer following tho
races, but they wore dear at the price. The first race
was for Maiden Single Souliers. The course was given
in the programme as from Fletcher's round Snnke
Island and back to the tt C. Shad. We invested “ five
bob” on a burly mechanic, and just as the men were
settling to their work, our man being well up, the
leader stopped, and wa were informed tho race was
over, the winner turning up in J. Nash. The facetious
committee had altered tho course. Tho eecsnd race.
Maiden Fours, whioh was started a trifle over an hour
behind time, resulted in a win for T. F. Walker’s crow.
The third evenQ Maiden Doable Sculls, was won by
Milham and Aikeahead. But two men started for the
Junior Single Soulls, and they wore kept fully twenty
minutes at tho post waiting for tho starter. J. Langley
won as he liked. It was then too late to go through
with the last face on the card.
Tho Bombay (India) foxhounds and thirty horse-
men took the field early one morning, and after a little
delay a hyena was started. At first the hyena and
hounds outpaced the horses, but after about three
miles the horses caught up. One of the fleetest horses
there ran a mile at top speed to break the hyena's wind.
Coming to a pool of water, the hyena went iu and lay
down, and tho hounds came np and drank within a few
feet of the asimal’s mouth. The pace had been tro.
meudous. Some one threw a stone at the hyena. He
started again, and ran for miles, hounds and horses
wall up. He doubled several times "as cute as a fox,"
and finally, on ascending a hill, the novel spectacle pre-
eented itself of the hyena walking, the hounds walking
close behind, and the horses close behind them. There
was not a trot left in either ef them. Finally one of
the horsemen rode at him and knocked him down with
his horse’s fore hoofs. The master coming up, and find-
ing that the hyena could not run another yard, killed
him with his knife. The distance covered was about
twenty miles.
The visit of Maoe and Slade has added to the
boxing boom in America, which is now at fever heat.
Maoe has stated that the box between Slade and Robin,
son, the heavy weight amateur, was an arrangtd affair,
Slade agreeing not to play heavy, but give tho amateur
a chance to show off before his friends in the hall. Jem
also stated that the Maori threw Miller like a child, in
New Zealand Wo know this to be untrue, so the
former statement is to be taken for what it is worth.
We are inclined to believe it, as Slade boxed with Mace
at their exhibition at Frisco on Jan. 8, and made a
really scientific set-to, frequently getting on to Mace,
and showing altogether different form from that (xhi-
bited by him in his bout with the amateur. The spar-
ring appears not be have been savage, but as it was
pupil sotting to with toaoher, all iwanoo must be made
in that respect. The 'Frisco Examiner says
one was pleased with tho show, and the general opinion
seemed to be that Sullivan will flod Slade to be a harder
man than he has met yet ” With regard to the attend-
ance the same paper says :—‘'Downstairs, where scats
cost two dollars, every vacant spot was taken up be-
fore 8 p m., and such an assemblage of prominent
cit’zens has not been seen in San Pranoisoo since the
Nilsson concerts were held in the Grand Opera-
house.”
The Hawkeabnry Race Club had fine weather
on both days of their meeting, but the attendance was
only moderate. On Thursday the ball opened with tbe
Hurdle Race, whioh resulted in a win for Warrigal, a
length away from Songster, Satellite 3. The KowVy
Mile fed to Katapara, after a good rice up the stiaight
with Malta, Eaven 3. Aberfoyle beat Blue and White
by half a length for the Clatet Stakes, Kingsdalo secur-
ing a place. Yosemite won the Public Auction Slakes,

A couple of ingenious physicians in Paris, MM.
Debove and Dujardin Beaumete, have invented a now
treatment for consumption. It consists in a practice
styled super-alimentation, nob only over-fending, but
forced feeding, by means of pumps, &o. Consn mptlve
patients, who could not retain food when taken in the
usual way, did not find it unpleasant to have tubes
introduced and food pumped into them until most
remarkable quantities bad been taken. The principal
article taken in this super-alimentation is meat powder
—prepared by minoing lean meat very finely, spreading
the paste thus formed on porcelain tables, and letting
it dry at a temperature of 90 deg, centigrade. When
completely deprived of water, the mass is reduced to
powder by pounding, and put away for use. It is
administered in milk or simple bouillon, with the addi-
tion of eggs, if deemed advisable—thus forming a
highly nutritious and yet readily digestible mass,
which has been found as efficacious in hysteria and
wasting diseases as in consumption, tor whioh it was
first devised.
Away in the valley of the Hunter is a little town
called Hinton. It is built at the junction of the Pater-
son and Hunter, and viewed from the green hills of
Morpeth is all red brick and tabernacle. It is tho
holiest township since the days of Jerusalem, and ia
suspected by many to be the site of tho original Para-
dise. The Hunter and Paterson are modern names for
two of the historic rivers; the two others were not
pare, so were told to dry up. One third of the year tho
people work, tho rest they pray. The parsons there
are preying always Tea-meetings and lodge meetings
originated there. It is no mere an Australian town
than Largs or any other graveyard is. Old Scotch
convenauters hold the fort. Hinton is the most Saw-
bath observing township in Australia. Probably this
explains why, if you dig two feet to put in a foundation
stone for a tabernacle yon’re bound to oome on a skele-
ton with an eloquent gash in his cranium. However,
the old settlers have mostly turned into bone-dust, and
the pnblio-school doesn’t expoutd the catechism. By
tho way, whenever a muddy fresh occurs in the Hunter,
the Newcastle people have a habit of saying—" Hullo 1
more elders bapth od at Hinton."
With suoh a harbour, we ought to be a com-
munity almost able to defy drowning. But so many
venture into or on the water without any idea of
swimming, that tho wonder ia rather that more are not
drowned. With all the facilities for acquiring swim-
ming, it is little short of crime to go boating or bathing
in ignorance of the art. We may j uat casually mention
a recent case.. At New Year, two well-known young
ladies were in tho baths at Little Manly, and, though
quite unable to swim, they, either confidently or care-
lessly, wandered out of their depth. Twenty ladles
were looking on, yet not one was proficient enough to
sfford the necessary help. On the alarm being given,
Mr. Von Hammer atonoe teokto the water fully clothed,
without oven removing his boots, for the girls had
already sunk twice. Though they, as might have been
expected, clung tenaciously round his neck, and dragged
him under water, he sue aeeded at last in tearing them
asunder, and, swimming with legs only, carried tho
limp and clinging maidens ashore. Mr. Von Ham-
mer’s conduct on this occasion was very grace fully
acknowledged by the parents.
A NEW PSALM OP LIFE.
For the Lyre.
Tell me not, in happy numbers,
“ Trams are but an empty dream ”
He who thinks so, surely plumbers,
Trams are really what they seem.
Trams are real, trams are earnest.
And the station’s not their goal:
“ Dnrat thou start ? Thou dust returnest 1"
This is spoken from the soul.
Not enjoyment, but much sorrow.
Is a ride to Coogeo Bay;
You may start for there to-morrow—
Find yourself in Heaven next day.
Steam is fast, and timi is precious.
But our hearts, that stoutly boat.
Quail to think out' friends may fetch ua
AU in pieces off the street.
Try not with tho tram to battle.
It will worst yon in the strife —
Come along with merry rattle—
Halve you like the butcher’s knife.
Trust no tram, however pleasant,
Take a cab or horse instead.
Or. if you’ve no cash at present.
Use your feet —and save your head.
Level crossings all remind us
Walking ont is not sublime
When we’re apt to leave behind us
Legs or arms at any time.
Limbs from whioh, perhaps, another
Tramoar rushing o’er the track—
Taking pattern from its brother—
Chops off yet another snack.
Let ns, then, mind what we’re doing.
Or, since heav’n’s to bo our fato.
Gentle tramoars, still pursuing.
Will not leave us long to wait.

He stole a lady’s purse. When the P.M. asked
what drove a person of his apparent respectability to
do such a thing, ho answered thusly : “The old time
came o’er me. I thought I was once more a police-
man."
Messrs. Anthony Hordern and Sons, of the
Pals.cs Emporium, Hay market, have recently given an
order to Messrs. Jarrett and Co., for Three Million of
Counter Billheads, which consumes over Sevsn tons of
paper. We understand this is the largest order of its
kind ever given, and speaks volumes for the immense
business being done by the former firm, and the supply-
ing capabilities of the latter. ♦
To those who can read between the lines in
American papers, it is quite plain that the Langtry-
Gebhardt affair is all bosh, and that Mrs. L. knows a
sood deal too much to give any foundation to rumours
which, while they advertise her splendidly, would be
fatal to her position (an undeniable one) in England.
As a matter of fact, the whole thing, as it now appeals,
was got up by Stetson and Abbey to “ boom” her; and
there is not a paper in London which has not laughed
at the cleverness of the “fake." One London journal
—a thing called Town Talk, and edited by one
Adolphus Bosenberg—once made some accusations
against Mrs Cornwallis West’s moral character (not
ha f so ludicrous or infamous as those blared against
the Jersey Lily by the N.Y. journals), and he promptly
got three years—the judge stating that he was sorry he
couldn’t commend Adolphus to the polite attentions of
the local Upjohn. If anything wore wanted to convince
people that the Langtry scandal is all bunkum, we have
only to quote Mr. John Stetson’s (supposed) utter,
ances to a reporter on Music and Drama—Stetson, it
may bo remarked, being an actor of the lowest grade,
and as celebrated for his ignorance as for his coarse-
ness and profanity. After the performance at Boston,
Stetson commenced his conversation, which he reports
to be as follows:—
“ * Why did not Mrs. Labouchere come to Boston
with you ?’
‘“Because she objected to some of my move-
ments.’
“ * But it is better for you to have a lady com-
pan'on with you ’
“‘Yes; I think so myself. I have telegraphed to
Mr. Langtry to send his sister aver.’
“ ‘Do yon know it does you no good having that
young man running after you ?’
‘“I cannot see any harm in it ’
“‘Perhaps you don't; but people will talk. I
consider it very improper. Besides, it will injure
your business, both theatrically and financially •’
“ ‘ Well, perhaps it is best that I keep to myself.’ ’*
Now, it must be remembered that Stetson is a man with
whom it is a hundred to one, Mrs. Langtry would never
converse at all; but even supposing she did, it is of
course, extremely improbable she would make these
admis ions, or permit herself to be addressed in such
terms by a creature who is three grades lower than a
circus-clown Goedcess knows we have mean papers
enough iu Sydney, but for champion meanness com-
men! us to the New York rags. A woman need make
plenty of money in America if she have to put up with
this kind of thing But even funnier than the Stetson
interview is an article on the lady written by John C.
Freund. He says that when Mrs. Langtry was coming
away, the Prin e of Wales asked various ladies to give
the Lily introductions for New York; but on the
Marchioness of Hastings (erstwhile the notorious Lady
Ploreace Paget) writing to him that Mrs. Langtry had
been on a tour through Switzerland with her husband
Sir George Chetwyud, the Prince, seeing that introduc!
ing Mrs Langtry was of no avail, gave >.er, himself,
the following letter: — ’
“My Dear Mrs In presenting my friend.
Mrs. Langtry, to you, I feel sure you will do your
utmost in enabling her to successfully undertake a
revelation of har dramatic experience in London
for which her personal qualities so eminently fib
her.’’
It was signed “A. E." and dated from Marlborough
House. After this the delnge. Why they’d even write
Peter Campbell down a masker in America—or perhaps
somathing else. * r
SOCIAL.
In England and America they now rehearse
fashionable weddings. The whole ceremony is gone
through, except as to th ] answering of questions,
The custom is said to have come from England; but
wherever it originated, it is very necessary. A faux
pas at a wadding ceremony L- highly disagreeable j and,
unless all the parties arc fully aware of exactly what
they are to do at specified moments. It is hardly pos-
sible to get through without an embarrassing blunder
of somesort. Yo i know, also, how superstitious some
folks are if there is the Ivaat thing amisa at a wedding.
Therefore, unless the marriage is strictly pxivata, the
rehearsal should, under no oitoumstunoes bo omitted,
as it ia, after all, not much trouble. The parson, it is
under?toad, is not present. The procession. is merely
formed and marched into the room or up the aisle of
the church, and the groom and bridesmaids acd grooms
men take their places, while it is distinctly explained
w.iat Is tc be done at each stage of the pr oooodings. Of
ooutce the rehearsal stops at the ceremony,

la it oorroot form to reverse? The question is,
and has been for several years, a deputed point of ball,
room propriety. 1*sizzled people who flutter in, or on
the edge of, the golden circles of society yearn to know
this : Do those mysterious unknowns who originate the
fashions favour or frown on the reverse ? With a view
of settling the knotty point, two writers have given
their ideas iu a London paper. Tke first, presumably a
malo, lays down his opinion in a decidedly "dictatorial
way." " Never by any chanoo reverse," he says. “ Eo
versing is the acme of snobbishness; it originated in
the very lowest daneing-placcs, and was never tor one
mom oat accepted in. England. It appeared at the
mixed balls of sea side towns. It permeated to out-of-
the-way country places, where people know no better,
tint it never really * oame in,' and there is not the
slightest probability that it ever will. It is absolutely
intolerable, and the man who dances it both looks an
idiot and is deemed a snob.” The second writer
is a lady, and touching the remark that reversing
came of the lowest origin and was not practised
iu good society, she replies "I think if the gentleman
who thus wrote will make enquiries he will find that in
both statements he is wrong. I was in England five
years ago, when reversing first came into fashion, aud
went to Eoms ijf the very bast balls, both private and
military, and you were not supposed to be in good
society unless you could reverse; iu fact, your partner
took it for granted that you could. It was first intro-
duced in Paris at the very best private houses by
American ladies, and is pnrely an Austrian and Ameri-
can way of dancing. English people, and especially
English women, cannot danca it properly; they flop
about all over the place and hop and bump against
other people in a very ludicrous way. I wish yen
could 8M a really good couple of American dancers;
vou would never revile 'reversing’ again. Iu London
ballrooms, I have danced twenty waltzes in one night,
but I could not have done it I not bean able to
reverse; it ia an awful tax ou one’s brain to k:-ep
revolving one way " New, by laying this evidence
before the libhe-limbod dancers who, in a few weeks, will
go down nightly to the waltzing world, we place them
in that advantageous position which enables them to do
whichever they please, and still feel fortified by strongly
expressed authority. Ia dubious case* of propriety,
very clover people generally seek fafsty by adopting
the middle course suggested by Pope—
“ Be not the first by whom the new is tried,
Nor yet the last to lay the old aside."
Mr. Pope, howove”, didn’t denoe ; aud anyway, his use-
ful advice would not apply to reversing in Sydney, for
the sides are about evenly divided for and against. In
private houses and all public balls, soma dancers re-
verse and soma don’t—principally according to whether
they can or can’t. That ia how the matter stands at
Jireaent. Inexorable fashion will not allow it to stand
osg. Already there are rumours that the reverse—
this most convenient and graceful of methods, the do-
light of everyone who is really fond of dancing, and has
any pretentions to proficiency in it—is to be diacon.
tinned. Because it is common. When a thing becomes
common, fashion drops it. It may be healthy, grace-
ful, sensible; it may have beau acquired at infinite
troub b ; it may have had only the shortest reign ; but
let just the whisper of "bad form" be heard, and
•' society" would sooner die than do it any louver, even
though warm in its praises a weak gone by. We don’t
Bay reversing ia doomed yet: oven whan the decree goes
out, it will probably still continue to bo practised by
thoss who like what is ia itself sensible, as well as free
from any sound objection, and who do not consider
that to follow the " correct thing" in the fleeting
fashions of the day is the highest aim of existence.
But rumour says it ia to ba dropped. The fashionable
world might with advantage drop many things sooner
than this.

On the 7th instant, at Palmerston Terrace,
Glebe Point, Miss Baddon (erstwhile of Rockhampton)
was united in the holy bonds with Mr. Charles Badgery,
brother of Mr H, S. Badgery, M P. The bride, a tall
graceful blonde, was attired in white satin, with tulle
veil, and orange blossoms on her golden hair. The
bridesmaids, Miss Emilia B idden, Miss Fox, and Miss
Badgery, of Bummer Hi'l, were prettily dressed in
cream llama with cardinal eatin trimmings, and each
wore a floral circlet. The Rev. A. Gardiner officiated,
and “ delivered his soul" in a long Scotch homily to
the young couple on the important step they were tak-
ing tcgc.Uer. After braakfas’, amid a sfco vor of Patna,
they left by the western train far the exhilarating
atmosphere of Mount Victoria.

We just dip into Humming Bee’s sprightly
written notes for the autamu fashion?, as shown at
Plemlngton. Many of the fall dresses received their
first airing. The great quantity of plain velvet worn
was remarkable, and not less so was the popularity of'
plaids. Bee gives, assurance that plaids, worn with
judgment, give a very ohio look to a costume, but
prudema must be used, or all good effect is lost. They
must not form the body and whole skirt entirely—os-
psoially the largest kinds, which arc so easily made
vulgar; but, skilfully combined with whole colours,
they are a great success. Many of the mahoganies
(now colour) were visible, in velvet, satin, and cloth.
More than half the “dressed " ladies had elegant little
prinoosae straw bonnets, with a coronet of velvet across
the front matching the wearer’s dress. Capos were
plentiful, of sealskin, racoon, and of brown beaver with
silvery hairs. This pungent little extract will speak
for itselfWhy, bh ! why will stout women—the
kind who seem to be running over at every possible
place—wear light odours and fripperies ii the way of
lace cascades, full sleeve?, aud panier bodies P Is the
imagination of an immensely stout woman so dull that
she is unable to sea bow she adds to her size in eo
small degree by her unwise style of dress ? The lady-
like graoeful woman wears the close small Princets
bennet, and the subdued tasteful toilette, while her less
fortunate sistar, who wants toning down in every
passible wav, is daringly audacious, rushing ia where
others fear to (read."

The Fort-street school concert was an excellent
affair. With the aid of several professionals, the pro-
gramme was made more att-aotive than usual. Mips
Clara Hamilton, Signora Pabris, Miss Marie St. Clair,
Mr. Woods, and Signor Paladin! all contributed, and
tie Exhibition cantata, compose 1 by Herr Hugo A'pen,
who acted as accompanist, was well given by thechirus
of children, and was one of the best items. A proces-
sion march by the Harr was also played; and the hum-
ming aoeompauimeno to several songs by the children
was a nice variation. An intricate floral march opened
the second part, the pretty dresses of the children, the
flowers, aud the limelight, all adding a chares aud a
novelty. At the termination of the procession, a lovely
1 tile girl walk ad up to Mr. Q. H. Reid and pie sea ted
him with a beautiful bouquet, which he gallantly
acknowledged on the spot with a kiss, and next day by
a vote of thanks and a little present to the little lady.

To hang their picture I without defacing the
T *wn Hall, the Art Society erected a boarding some
< ot from the walls all round, which made the veatioule
i >k curiously small. Company at the opening was not
i ■■a “fashionable," but chiefly representative of what
■ still better —the artistic element. Mr. Combes
ed with a full-sized speech, and Mrs. Dalgarno and
Jl , Gorman then drew the lucky tickets fcp the prizs-
«. M era ia the Art Union. Sir F. Smith, of Tasmania,
► • c > - ed the first prize, set down as worth fifty guineas,
• > ao less than four Governmental members gained
<, which, considering that the Government sub-
the society this year and last with £250, was a
very satisfactory coincidence. Over 400 pictures were
eAibitod.ua the largest on a appeared to contain about
oOln. of paint. Wo wonldu t carry that piotnfe away,
even if we were strong enough—unless the paint was
scraped off first. It represents Ariadne after she was
deserted by Thossus on Naxos. If Ariadao was any-
thing like she i„ iu that picture, wo don't wonder
Theseus left her. Mfs. S'ofiiiart’s exquisite portrait
of a girl’s fair haad, and shoulders draped in laoo of
minute aad beautiful workmanship, was a centra of
admirers. Botno pictures were terribly crude, others
has. been painted in haste specially for the exhibition ;
but oho greatest number were decidedly good, and some
of tho landscape and figure works by well-known hands
will gam them more green laurels, f A full notice of
tho Art Society's Exhibition will appear next week.]

, Considering all drawbacks, tho Owl picnic at
the Sir Joseph Bulks was fairly attended. People
strolled through the gardens, danced, skated, cricketed,
or raoed till lunch time, when those who brought bas-
kets took their meal en famille, while the majority wont
up to the hotel and demohshei Frank Smith’s dinner,
which was laid in a now zinc palace just erected. There
were no speeches, so aftor President Caddy told them
there was nothing more to step for, they filed out and
resumed their skimming over the glassy floor, and other
things Ladies predominated, and pure whites were
very tasty. Mnaio, literature, and drama were all repre-
sented With the exception of lady invite os, the picnic
was confined to Owls only, and a special tram carried
the party out and home.

Mr. and Mrs. John Ferguson, of Parramatta,
celebrate! their youngest son 1 * twenty-first birthday by
an evening party, on the 14th instant. About half a
hundred did honour to Stanley by a night's music,
tinging, and dancing. Lanterns shod a light that was
beautifully soft on young people that ware the same.
Hostess wore black silk brocluS, and Stanley's sis.
graced a black silk-figured grenadine. Two taper
sisters were stylish, one in black velvet and cardinal
satin—tho other in old gold surah satin, with high puffed
paniers, and black lace sleeves. White muslin aad
pearls was neatly simple. Sydney visitors returned by
the 5 am. train.
• * *
little party at ” Airedale,” Summer
Hill, last weak, and among tho pianistoa a lady “ ex
Cuzco * was a clever favourite. The hostess giro seve-
ral songs, a Survey Ofiiie slave reoited, and it was
op s ®rved that those who listened to him made a vin-
dictive onslaught on Compagnoni's refreshment tables.
A distribution of prizes would result somehow in this
way : two Doliya for boat dressed ; two Marys for beat
music; and two Mabels for the fewest years and manyost
charms.

-n^ rs ’i Olivia, gave a fapoy dross ball at
TuO Cottage” on tho 13:h, iiortelf appearing iu pliiu
but okarnsiug ooatuzno, while Miss Iroy was a pretty
Bi-peep with a orook— so captivating that half the
youths were lost ahe?p directly. The belle of the
evening was a swest-faoed girl iu white, from a district
station. Franco was gay, and dbgagd. A dark young
cricketer went right over to Prance, and ho makes —wo
forget how many. Madame Esmond displayed the
finest dress. A ohubby and good looking girl made a
fascinating sailor lass c. She wore anchors ; but is
still at sea. Other ladies’ drosses were not bad. But
it’s taste, dear girls, that carries you to the fronk Tho
dear boys were simply grand. Tha host was a fireman,
and, of course, had his hosa ; bat he couldn’t compote
with the ho a a that encased the neatest ankles in the
world. Their hose lit flames, didn’t quench them.
Master C Irby was a harlequin, very funny. He was
just as fuuay two days afterwards—with the p.aiat still
on his nose. Mr Campbell was aa-ico North Pole, but
before the ball was over ho got very near tho Equator ;
that is to say, he was encircling—but never mind, let's
hum “ She’s all tha world to me.” A dark cricketer
caused gnashing of teeth —his own. A genial surveyor
was tho Shah, aad a gontleman in football costume
looked boat when Ids feet were hid under tho table
And then there was the show On tho show ground
cream and cardinal dresses warn prominent, with pretty
bonnets to match. Franco and her sisters ruled the
waves from the family coach. A young married lady
in grey pink, with a pratty face, draw many admiring
eyes. This was the first day of the show. On the
second day, black dresses wore numerous j a married
lady in a handsome black silk carrying off the honours.

In connection with the Bohemian CC.,a con-
cert was given In Glebe Town Hall, on Tuesday. We’re
not clear what ‘‘in connexion’' means; but it’s most
likely the old thing—to buy an Afghan locket for the
highsst scorer. Though the “ad " said it would be a
“grand'* concert, it wasn’t particularly so. There
were no ladies performing, and Mr. Halle well didn’t
have his innings. Messrs. Fitzpatrick, Percy Jones,
Baker, and Sainford, however, sang with average suc-
cess, and Mr. Huenerbeln accompanied them, and came
in for a share of clapping from tha email boys who per-
vaded the back scats Had seme more people been pre-
sent, there would have been a fair audience But wa
doubt whether the Bohemians will bo able to buy any
locket.

The Hercules Dramatic Club played a ballroom
scene on Tuesday night at Nithadaie. Arrangements
as usual, and the party, among whom tte Hebrew
element was large, danced till 4 u’cl ck. Tuo daughters
of Judah didn't sit down by the waters of-Babylou to
any great extent and weep; but they eat in the con-
servatory, in the metaphorical purple and fine linen so
dear to their race, aad smiled; willih suits their dark
lustrous eyes a good deal bettor. Cohen and Com-
pagnoni, between them, looked after visitors. Fancy
dress was allowed, but cot much availed cf. B.oude
Miss Smith wore white, Miss Pyrmont Patrick was in
shirred pink satin, Mrs, Storey was Folly, and tho
Cohen and Conway cousins ware all in crowelled satin.
Miss Eva Davies wore cream, and a brunette was in
shrimp satin and masses of black lace, which were very
advantageous to her. Misses Jones chose sombre black
and roses. Misses Mathews, of Botany-street, wore
cream, and pink and cream toilets, and one of them
was rather pretty. A Vivandie re was very plain Mrs.
John Davies was in handsome black and gold velvet.

The concept by the Sydney Lisdertafel on
Tuesday evening added another to the list of the
Society’s successes. The part songs ware given with all
the verve and precision by which the executants have
established their reputation, and which testify to the
ability of their conductor, Mr. Edwards. The solo per-
formances did not add greatly to the attraction of the
evening, with the distinguished exception of Mr.
M Quads’s rendition of Thaloeig’s fantasia on “ Lcs
Jlugumots,” a composition bristling with difficulties
which the performer converted into charms. Mr. Pal-
ing s solo was toe long, albeit played in a manner which
b it a small number of violinists could surpass
Still, twanty-four solid minutes is too long to osk a
mixafij aulieace to lia ;on to a concerto interpreted by
anyone below the standari of a Joachim. Signora
Fabris scarcely brenpht out the full sentimental beauty
of the accompanied romance, Alla Stella Conlilente;
and an unfortunate mishap on the part of Signor
Puladini in tuning two leaves at onci, in the duet from
Lohengrin, maned the eff ict of th&t mcrcoau. The
addition of an orchestra to the resources of the society
proved a distinct success. The arrangement t f Faust,
which was played here by the Austrian band, was very
effectively executed; aud Elsasser’s setting cf the
beautiful Danube Waltzes for voices and band quite
took the audience by storm. The seating arrangements
wore excellent; enl altogether the concert of Tuesday
last marks a forward step iu the caieer of the Laider-
tafel.

Some interesting wedding events are on the
fapts in the railway suburbs for the coming week. A
German Count (in this case a gentleman of substance),
marries a handsome Ashfield widow, who has already
made a small start in life. On Easter Tuesday, at St.
Luke’s, the son of a Goulbura squatter lea Is to the
altar a charming Bomebush girl, daughter of a well-
known Sydney solicitor. Invitations to 75 couple to
the bridal festivities. On the following day, also at St.
Luke’s, Concord and Croydon become united, the bride
being a sprightly handsome daughter of a Croydon
house. Bridal banquet at the mansion of one of Syd-
ney’s eldest solicitors, Burwood.

Miss Dick, of Melbourne, has inaugurated
walking touts fir hsr young ladies. Miss Dick already
keeps a ladits’ gymnasium, which is crowded with fair
creatures who swing big c’.nbs about and davelope
musolo to an extant that cannot fail to command re-
speot. The bold man who would a-wooing go among
Misa Dick’s young ladies had better make up hie mind
to ba a civil lover At a bill in Waiwera (N Z ), that
substantial young lady. Miss Graham, the manageress,
srew suddenly giddy and fell ia a faint, whoa Sir George
Gray gallantly ran to pick her up. Ho meant well, but
he overlooked the fact that 180 pounds of Io v ely woman
is about the same weight as 180 pounds of anything
else. After throe trios and no aign of a lift, the
gallant old warrior resigned, and two lusty youths
in first-class muscular form prized her up and

Masonic Hail at Parramatta was formally opened,
ou completion, with n stylish concert, last week. It
has already been used for a go id few dances, while in
an unfinished state Humming Bee thus unburthens
her soul about that class of male beings who, in
America, are designated by the ugly word “ masher,”
as they exhibited at Plemington Baces :— •* They imi-
tate women in every possible way. I blush to record it,
but it is a fact that many gentlemsn wore gold bangles,
and, in one iastaoce, a gold band about an inch wide
was donned I could forgive their silk handkerchiefs
with fancy borders, their tan undressed kid gloves, the
pointed toes ef their shoes, their gorgeous neckties,
their alarmingly stiff, stand-up collars, their diamond
lockets, and studs, and links; but bangles worn by men
are a reproach and a shame, and it is high time for
ladies to oast them on one side," The new-mown
sward was springy as a rubber cushion, and the gardens
were at their brightest and best, when the Nelsen band
played last Monday. Some diversion was caused by the
German war vessel departing with stately glide down
the bay, its own band the while playing England's
national anthem. Although the gathering was numer-
0*9, and costumes included a groat variety, there was

The Bulletin was duly honoured at St.
Patrick’s Day Sauqnet. Mr O’Eyau was very severe
nn the Sydney secular press, with one exception—the
©ply liberal English paper of the lot. Ha roundly
charged the venerable morning and its penny youngster
with a deliberate attempt so set man against man, and
with condemning the leaders of the Irish people on
testimony which would not be admitted in the (jase of
„ murderer—the evidence of an uncorroborated ap-
prover The name of The Bulletin was received
with rounds of enthusiastic applause.
There has been trouble taking up the colleetion
in a primitive Northern church. At first, a collar-box
neatly covered with green paper was used, but a heavy
King George penny knocked the bottom out. Then a
ladle was used, but it was found to be too small, as
several highly influential but aged members of the con-
gregation would often miss it altogether and the money
would drop on to the floor At last, they tried a tin
dipper, and it acted first-class for a while j but one day
when it was put down with the money collected (repre-
sented by a •* thrip’ny”) near the door, a yokel who had
been as’esp took it in passing out, filled it wit* water,
and swallowed the offertory.
The following calculation as to the dimensions
of Heaven, based on a text of Eevelation, starts a new
and consolatory idea. Eevelation, xxl, 16: “And ha
measured the city with a reed, i twelve thousand fur-
longs The length and breadth and height are equal.
Twelve thousand furlengs—7,920,000 feet, which being
cubed is 913,088,000,000,000.000,000.000,000 cubic feet,
usd half of which we will reserve for the Throne of God
and the Court of Heaven; half of the balance streets,
and the remainder divided by 4096, the cubical feet in
the room, sixteen feat square and-sixteen feet high,
will be 30 813,750,000,000 rooms. We will now suppose
the world Mways did and always will contain 930,000.000
of Inhabitants, and a generation will last thirty and a
third years—3.700,000,000,000 persons. Then, suppose
there ware 11 230 such worlds, equal to this in number
of inhabitants and duration of years—thin there would
be a room sixteen feet wide and sixteen feet high for
oaeh person, and yet there would be room. What we
want to know how from Dr. Bsg is the exact sire of
Hell.
Mr. Cherbury, the rev. party who had the Col-
ling wood tabernacle, lately wont to England, and left
Dowie in charge. The Presbtterian now says that on
his return Mr. C. found “ the congregation and taber-
nacle nearly destroyed.” We are waiting to see, now,
what Dewio will say to this. Ton can just fancy how
the syllables will pour forth in shoals, and how the
foam will fly when that explanation aura lieu. We re-
member the godly Alexander, when he used to “ pitch ”
on Sundays at a little hall over o coach-builder’s in
Castlereagh-street. His extempore prayers used to
amnse the local youth very much, since in them wore
embodied politics, prophesies, arithmetic, denuncia-
tions, descriptive, and singlestick, wo believe, and the
nse of the globes. Then the old party turned up and
said he was going t® give Dowie a £10,000 pitch-place.
Could that ancient gent, have been a gay deceiver ?
He left; and no more has been heard of him. Perhaps
he’s found an uglier man than Dowie, and is going to
givo him the tabernacle. We dare say he might dis-
cover that it he travelled a great deal. But whether
Mr. D. gets the tabernacle or not, hi will not starve.
He has lots of friends in Sydney, many of them having
enquired of ns, with great empmsement, as to his
whereabouts. They probably want to be converted.
