The Art of Making Memoirs
One of the mysteries of the publishing
trade is how it pays, and who it pays, to
issue these weighty tomes of personal
memoirs, diaries and journals which are pour-
ing from the press. Is there in aristocratic
circles in England at present a hobby for
publishing at one’s own expense? Or per-
haps these titled folk exchange copies of
each other’s reminiscences at Christmas
instead of the boxes of chocolates and per-
fumery of commerce.
The seed of the abundant ci'op has appa-
rently been broadcasted, with the result that
the books are all as like as two peas in a
pod. Take as a sample the recently-printed
memoirs of any lady of quality. The frontis-
piece is a beautifully reproduced portrait of
the noble authoress; and throughout the
volume will be found photographs of various
barrack-like country-seats —-rather suggestive
of institutions for the afflicted- —in some way
connected with the clan of the writer of the
book. The first chapter is usually genea-
logical ; but owing to slipshod English and
the ramifications of the family-tree, the old
conundrum of “This-man’s-father-is-my-
father’s-son” is crystal-clear by comparison
with the problems presented. In the second
chapter, which embarks upon the narrative,
the authoress will probably relate as her
earliest recollection how she was held in the
arms of Disraeli, the Archbishop of Canter-
bury, Pitt or William the Conqueror.
While the reader is assimilating this thrill-
ing information, he is whisked suddenly into
a spirited account of a jazz at some military
hospital during the Great War. But let
him keep cool and not be discouraged; for
in the next sentence he will be again switch-
backed to the era of William —Pitt or the
Conqueror, as the case may be. It is all
very chatty, but just a little confusing. The
motto on the family escutcheon must surely
be “Non Sequitur,” or possibly “Nihil ad
Rem.” Fair ladies and blue-blooded maidens
referred to playfully in the text by their pet-
names of Gollywog or Jujube are said in
elaborately conscientious footnotes to be the
present Countess of Or Rampant, or the
Dowager Lady Lineage. It may be so ; but
in the words of the ancient ballad, “Who
Cares?” All through the book
Ambassadors crop up like hay
Prime Ministers and such as they.
And Dukes are three a penny.
Considering the lady’s carefully-planned
education —as detailed for the benefit of the
reader —one is forced to the conclusion that
there is something in the State school, after
all. Or perhaps it may still be true that
an ounce of mother-wit is worth a pound of
clergy. Stephen Leacock once parodied this
style of pompous classic in his “Aristocratic
Anecdotes.” In the light of recent examples
he rather understated his case. The feature
of these latter-day raconteurs is the flourish
ol trumpets—recalling the simmer on the
stage before the entrance of the Mikado —
with which they usher in some tiny,
shrunken chestnut. Also, why should the
fact that Lady Sophia Havering—“my
mother’s cousin” —was lady-in-waiting to
Queen Victoria plunge us straightway into
seas of foolish anecdotes of that monarch,
eminently calculated to make us weigh
against a grain of sand the glories of a
throne. Victoria, in her lifetime, was
capable of at least one epigrammatic remark
—when she told Gladstone not to talk to her
as if she were a public - meeting. It is
therefore probable that she would herself
have shunned these profane babblings, and
have sympathised with the reader who “is
not amused.” What has been termed Lytton
Straehey’s three-card trick of slipping in his
own Queen when we are not looking, is fair-
ness itself compared with these phonographic
records, for the palmed Queen in his case
is at least an interesting personality.
Then there are the even more irritating,
because so much more pretentious, “Adven-
tures at My Club,” or “Reminiscences of a
Reveller.’’ The index. and chapter contents,
fairly bristling with familiar names, make
the reader feel like John Gilpin, all agog.
But if you look up “Barrie,” “Hardy” and
“Galsworthy,” you will do it only to find the
clubman has never seen any one of the trio,
but has it upon unimpeachable authority that
each of them carries an umbrella when it
looks like rain. Though doubtful, you cut
in once more and turn up the Whistler anec-
There are at least three Whistler
stories, which were nil good in the rosy flush
of their dawn, but which are now as familiar
to the average reader as his own name. To
call the artist “Jimmy,” and to underline his
drawl, does not help them now. Phil May,
too! A friend of May’s has said that no one
would.be more surprised at the extent of his
acquaintance than the draughtsman himself.
These patronising parentheses of “Poor old
chap,” etc., from persons who, on their own
showing, would be suitably employed draw-
ing water to mix the ink of genius, though
they make the judicious grieve, have really a
rather humorous side. There are. of course,
a few refreshing exceptions; for instance,
the “Celebrities” of Coulson Kernahan, who
not only brings good grist to the mill, but
sifts it with all the tact of a skilled work-
man. But the dominant impression left by
most of these works is that the members of
“This” Club or “That” Club are a shocking
set of bounders. And the inflated nonsense
gets good reviews, which prate of revealing
sidelights on Bohemian personalities.
C. E. LEWERS.
The Philosophy of Giving
That self-help and self-reliance should be
the ends of charitable intent was the gospel
of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Thirty-eight
years of the life of Sir Charles Stewart
Loch, from the day he left Balliol to almost
the day of his death, were spent in putting
this gospel into effect. Since his death last
year the colleagues and friends of Loch, so
widely known by his association with the
Charity Organisation Society in England,
have compiled a volume from his papers and
addresses under the title of A Great Ideal
and its Champion (Allen and Unwin).
The word “charity,” from its long and evil
association with patronage, condescension,
and generally the supercilious attitude o
the rich towards the less affluent, has talien
into disrepute. To be the almsman or
charity, in its common meaning, counted as a
loss of respect for the recipient. Loen s
endeavor was to lift it from its plane ot
disrepute to that assigned to it by Emerson.
His “Ideal” was “the national organisation
of charity effective alike in preventing dis-
tress and in preserving the independence ot
our people.” He looked beyond sporadic
associations to a comprehensive system, a
social principle embodied in the national life.
In his day that ideal was not realised;
should it ever be—and the prospect is remote
—his words, his work and his life will have
gone far towards the attainment.
Loch was the somewhat unusual combina-
tion of philosopher and man of affairs. In
the latter office he so successfully managed
the concerns of the society that from its
foundation in 1869 by a small body of per-
cipient men who saw that the indiscriminate
alms-giving of the day was lowering the
independence of the people and encouraging
pauperism, it grew into a wide-spread organ-
isation numbering many thousands of mem-
bers. It is, however, with Loch as a social
philosopher—the son of Oxford “ever calling
us to the true goal of all of us, to the ideal,
to perfection”—that these papers more par-
ticularly deal. “Charity,” says he, “is not
a general philanthropy, or any of the diverse
forms of relief, but a social principle.
Accordingly it has a social purpose ; it re-
quires a social discipline; it works through
sympathy; it depends on science; and in fer-
vency it is religious. Ultimately society is
based on charity, on love working through
the individual and the social life; and social
advance depends largely on the ability of
the people to realise this principle and to act
upon it.” In Loch’s sense the conception
and purposes of charity may be summarised
as effort to complete and perfect social life
by the completion and perfection of the lives
of its members. The alleviation of imme-
diate distress is inconclusive. Charity must
look beyond that. It must search out the
cause, find a remedy, and apply it; must
devise means to facilitate the ascent of
dependent units to independent life; must
enforce the obligation of moral and
social duties, such, for example, as
the maintenance of children. “We shall
not therefore feed children,” he says, “so as
to remove that obligation from the parents;
but we will use every method that keeps
them to their duty.”
The popular conception of charity is that
it is applied to the relief of poverty. It is
not necessarily so. Its aim ought to be
social efficiency. “If poverty or insuffici-
eflt resources is the active cause of social
incompetence, then poverty falls within the
range of charity. But with many who are
classed as poor it is not the active cause.
Other causes are at work, and these, strictly
speaking, and not poverty, charity has to
consider.” Many who are called poor are far
from being socially incompetent. It is not
charity to keep a tramp afloat who. while
capable of honest work, elects the easier job.
Loch insists, repeatedly, that charity must
go hand in hand with social reform, not
alleviating immediate distress only, but seek-
ing continuously to uplift and discipline the
submerged life. Where the means, the
tools, the appliances necessary for the appli-
cation of labor are required, then let charity
supply them, and see that they are used.
Charity without plan, organisation and a
clear objective is a social curse rather than
a social blessing. Philanthropists as items
in a disorganised crowd work blindly and do
evil rather than good, taking from the people
“their strength—their bread of life —and giv-
ing them philanthropic stones.” Philan-
thropy which encroaches on the duties asso-
ciated with the home, relieving the parents
of their natural duty in the provision of food
and clothing and their social duty in the
observance of economy and thrift, weakens
independence and tends to transmit the weak-
ened character to the children. Loch’s
“Ideal” —in the machinery suggested for its
attainment —reflects some of the elements of
socialism; but it is a paradoxical socialism,
inasmuch as it looks at the problem subjec-
tively, not objectively. It is not the struc-
ture of the system that will determine the
social life, but the culture of the individual
that will evolve it. Political economy will
suffer no violent blows ; the fundamental in-
stincts—emulation, ambition and the rest —
are immutable. But in the whole field of
human activities the spirit of charity, of
helping the inefficient to efficiency, discip-
lining the idle to industry, lifting the hope-
less out of their environment of despair into
one of fair prospect, will work continu-
ously, its activities, directed by intelligent
organisation, ever searching out the failures
m life and removing the causes of their
failure. Charity will no longer dab the
plaster of a dole on the wound of poverty
and inefficiency, but will attack the cause,
whether it be in the individual or the social
system. Socialism constructs a system
and seeks to adapt the individual to the
system * Loch s Icnvijig the system
to the natural order of evolution, looks to
the fibre of mankind, through which the evo-
lutionary process will be developed

Barbarism Down the Ages.
Master Johann Dietz (Allen and Unwin)
snpphes a grim picture of Germany in the
litli century, when “frightfulness” reigned
ui peace as well as in war. Of one battle in
which Turks to the number of six to eight
thousand were pursued by Bavarians and
Walloons, the autobiographer, who was an
army surgeon at the time, remarks:
Not one was spared; all were massacred, and
most were then flayed. As a general thing, too
their bowels were searched in case it should be
found as had previously occurred, that the dead
men had swallowed ducats.
Many of the illustrations, reproduced from
engravings in the museums of Berlin and
Leipzig, depict the hangings, shootings and
torturings which were inflicted for minor
offences: “they lowed like bullocks/’ Dietz

DAVID JONES’
FOR SERVICF, Opp. G.P.0., SYDNEY
observes in reference to some unfortunates
wlio were subjected to the contemporary
equivalent of the “third degree.” But. as
always in any chronicle of Northern Euro-
pean life up to well on in the last century,
it is the attitude towards sickness and dis-
ease that provokes most wonderment, Hip-
pocrates and the rest of the Greek physi-
cians were, of course, ignorant of germs,
blood systems, antiseptics and a thousand
other commonplaces of modern medical
science; but, then, they were without
typhoid, small-pox, syphilis and many more
complaints which were almost epidemic m
Dietz’s day. It is significant of the hope-
less attitude towards bodily afflictions which
characterised the interregnum between the
end of the Age of Faith, when men were
touched for King's Evil, and the beginning
of our age of asepsis and anaesthetics, that
surgeons were usually hairdressers, as Dietz
"was. A few optimistic generations earlier
all classes had gone in for doctoring. Thus
Lord Herbert of Cherbury, who ante-dated
Dietz by just a century, wrote: —
It will become a gentleman to have some know-
ledge in medicine, especially the diagnostic part;
as also the prognostic part, whereby he may judge
of the symptoms either increasing or decreasing in
the disease, as also concerning the crisis or indi-
eatiori thereof. This art will get a gentleman not
only much knowledge but much credit.
He claimed to have cured his servant, Rich-
ard Griffiths, of “a malignant, pestilent
fever” with a certain “rare receipt the
quantity of a hazel-nut,” while his cousin
Atliolstan Owen, who had a liydrocephale,
and was “in that extremity that his eyes
began to start out of his head and liis
tongue to come out of his mouth, and his
whole head finally exceeding its natural pro-
portions,” was relieved by a “decoction of
two diuretic roots so suddenly and perfectly
that it seemed more like a miracle than a
cure.”
However, by Dietz’s day such enterprises
were chiefly the province of the humble, lie
himself had his successes, and, like Lord Her-
bert, he mentions no failures. When almost
dead of dysentery outside a fortress on the
Danube he felt a longing for pickled gher-
kins, and “ate over a hatful.” After which:
I slept for some six or eight hours. Then it
was as though I were newly born. The pain and
purging had ceased; there was no fever ; in summa I
was well again. This is well worth noting: that
what Nature craves for with inordinate desire is
her medicine.
On the same principle he would presumably
have prescribed a hearty meal for a typhoid
convalescent. The invalids who survived in
those days were a stout lot.
His method of treating “the French sick-
ness” (his name for syphilis) was peculiar:
I turned an upholstered chair upside down and
laid a plank seat upon it on which the patient
had to sit stark naked, while under him I set fire
to some spiritus vini in a small basin. There my
gentleman had to sit and sweat as long as he could
bear it. Then I laid him in his bed, gave him some
restoratives and went away.
Eventually the patient caught fire and was
nearly burnt to death, but “was cured, and
I received a magnificent fee.”
Could anything be more ghastly than the
superstition concerning mumia as a sovereign
cure for most disorders, whether applied out-
wardly or inwardly? lie describes its pro-
duction on the battlefield :
The fat of the corpses was roasted out, and great
saeksful dried and stored, for of these that most
costly preparation known as mumia was made.
The reader may turn from this book with
a sigh of relief that such barbarities are un-
imaginable nowadays. But are they? One
David Williams, of Doncaster (Eng.), has
just been convicted of fraudulently treating
cancer patients; he gave one woman a green
ointment “which scored great holes in her
flesh, causing her excruciating agony, and
to her complaints he smiled, ‘No pain, no
cure.’ ” A man with cancer of the tongue
“nearly went mad with the pain of the oint-
ment.” And dark ignorance is still found in
unsuspected places. The Medical Journal
oe Australia printed this disturbing item
a few weeks ago:—
There is probably no other common disease which
remains undiagnosed so frequently as pyelitis. As
the years roll by the patient perhaps acquires the
reputation of “catching influenza every winter.”
He is in a chronic state of ill-health. He now
changes his doctor, and the new man has the
patient’s teeth extracted, his antra examined with
X-rays or washed out. His “septic” appendix is,
of course, removed, and he is given intestinal anti-
septics, blue pill, sulphate of soda, etc. At last
he is unable to work, his savings are exhausted, and
finally he dies a pauper in a public hospital, and
at the autopsy is found a chronic pyelitis.
Meantime certain American universities are
turning out doctors by the dozen without
training or examination, primarily for the
purpose of qualifying them to prescribe
alcohol. The world proceeds but slowly in
humanity and knowledge—more especially
medical knowledge. We have learned some
tricks for the alleviation of suffering which

J.B.D.
Cadence; and Other Things
Though I have, I know, the wretched
taint in my blood (there are few enough
of us these science-shadowed days who alto-
gether escape it), I conscientiously believe
I have under reasonable control the instinct
for adding to a pet subject’s terminology.
But I do earnestly wish that, either by the
introduction of new terms or by a more
exact definition of the old, we could manage
to get clear on one or two not unimportant
points touched on below.
AVhat is cadence in verse? In music, of
course, it has a well-defined technical appli-
cation ; but just what the word signifies in
its prosodic connection nobody seems to have
any clear notion at all.
Webster’s relevant remark is, “Rhythmical
flow of language, in prose or verse” ; accom-
panied by the quotation, “The golden cadence
of poesy.” and the following passage from
Guest: “If in any composition much atten-
tion was paid the flow of the rhythm, it was
said (at least, in the 14th and 15th cen-
turies) to be ‘prosed in faire cadence.’ ”
Saintsbury’s fine glossary to bis “Historical
Manual of English Prosody” gives: “In
general, a term applied to the combined
rhythm of a line or batch of lines. In one
or two early passages of Wyntoun, Gower
and others, it seems to be employed in some
special sense as opposed to, or separated
from, rhyme, and has been conjectured to
signify alliterative rhythm. But this is very
uncertain, rather improbable, and in the
Gower case impossible.” In Webster’s usage,
which is quite common, there seems little,
if anything, more expressed than is covered
by the word “rhythm.” On the other hand,
as wielded by some authors—particularly
in dealing with prose or vers Hire —the term
is invested with certain subtle shades of
meaning, which are apparently clearly con-
ceived (and that differently in different
cases) only in the writer’s own mind. Thus
Pater speaks of Coleridge manifesting *a
certain languidly soothing grace or cadence” ;
while F. M. Hueffer, dealing with vers hire,
insists that "no exigency of metre must in-
terfere with the personal cadence of the
writer’s mind or the pressure of the recorded
emotion.”
In short, the word is a convenient maid-
of-all-work, a rouseabout. I venture to make
some concrete suggestions as to its legiti-
mate duties, at any rate in verse.
First, rhythm shall be restricted to mean
the kind of feet employed in a line or pass-
age. It will be correct to speak of “Hia-
watha” as being in trochaic rhythm, blank
verse in iambic rhythm, “The Triumph of
Time” in mixed iambic and anapaestic
rhythm. In this sense the customary nor-
mal substitution of trochees, anapaests. spon-
dees, etc., in, say, blank verse, will still
leave the norm of the rhythm iambic, and
their presence may be indicated by stating
that a line, e.g., Tennyson’s “Redder than
any rose, a joy to me,” has a general iambic
rhythm, but contains one (initial) element
of trochaic rhythm. .
Secondly, metre shall be used exclusively,
in accord with the growing fashion, with
reference to the length of ( i.e ., number of
feet in) a line.
Thirdly, as for cadence. . . . This presents
a more difficult problem; for, as will be
shown, the word, if called on to serve in both
cases, will have different significances when
applied to an individual lino and to a group
of consecutive lines. Used of one line, I
suggest, cadence shall mean the sum total
of the sound values of that line when spoken
aloud. Thus, embracing rhythm as one
(easily distinguished) element, it will com-
prise also the factors of vowel-colorings (in-
cluding complete and partial assonances, and
vowel-runs, and the sense of speed their
presence imparts to the line); alliterative
effects (both of accented and unaccented
syllables) ; rhetorical tones (emphasised, be-
yond the mere sense, by grammatical con-
structions, etc.) ; the actual sound-weight,
as it were (determined by such things as
the number and position of the monosyllables
used) ; the balance (i.e., the division of the
line into two or more noticeable components
—well illustrated by Patmore’s “So these
were green and those were gold”; Swin-
burne’s “Thy prophet, thy preacher, thy
poet”; and Brooke’s freakish “Intolerable
consanguinity”) ; pauses; and finally the
peculiar nuance that the use of a notable
word or phrase occasions (of which the fol-
lowing offer good illustrations; “laity” in
Donne’s “ ’Twere profanation of our joys
To tell the laity our love” ; “toning” in Her-
rick’s “Hushed be all things, no noise here,
But the toning of a tear”; the compound
adjective in Shakspeare’s “Nor dare I chide
the world-without-end hour”).
If, however, we propose to speak of the
eadenee of a batch of lines, the term will in-
volve at least one further circumstance. It
is rather difficult to express satisfactorily
by comment —though the subjoined examples
will, I hope, make the point quite lucid —
but the effect of the element of pause in par-
ticular, as it is found in the individual line,
is manifestly different from the pause-effects
characterising whole passages, and relating
to the occurrence of enjambment, or its
absence, with the lines remaining end-stopped
(or, in Saintsbury’s preferable terminology,
single-moulded). A shot at a philosophical
explanation would say that, since there are
certain apparent connections between most,
if not all, cadence-factors and the relative
position they occupy within the line (an
initial trochee in blank verse is very distinct
from one in, say, the fourth foot: and there
is al) the difference in the world between an
anapaest in the third foot and one in the
perilous fifth), it is to be expected that addi-
tional correlations will come into play when
the scope is extended to two or more lines.
Compare the following passages (both
from Keats) —the first from “Endymion,” the
second from “Lamia,” where the difference in
swing due to the handling of the enjambment
is. I think, sufficiently obvious: —
The Latmian persevered along, and thus
All were reanimated. There arose
A noise of harmony, pulses arid throes
Of gladness in the air-—while many, who
Had died in mutual arms devout and true,
Sprang to each other madly; and the rest
Felt a high certainty of being blest,
with
Lve ius from death awoke into amaze
To see her still, and singing so sweet lays ;
Then from amaze into delight he fell
To hear her whisper woman’s love so well;
And every word she spake enticed him cn
To uriperplexed delight and pleasure known.
I am struck, every time I meet it, with the
fine specimen afforded by a stanza in Francis
Thompsons “Daisy” :
Still, still I seem to see her, still
Look up with soft replies,
And take the berries with her hand,
And the love with her lovely eyes.
There is a peculiar something (obviously
connected with the “still”) about the first
two lines which marks them off at once from
the second half of the stanza, and, indeed,
from any other pair of lines in the poem.
Does the feature here disclosed (aided, of
course, by the important influence of the
rhyme) justify the use of separate terms for
one line and for a passage of several. 1
am strongly inclined to think so. Finally,
therefore, I suggest the description of
cadence, given in full above, be limited, as
there indicated, to refer to line-cadence
(stylishly, unilineal cadence) ; and the same
description, plus the items of enjambment
and rhyme, serve to define stanza-cadence
or passage-cadence (stylishly, multilineal
cadence).
Richard Meredith.
Idealism
The lives of most of us are given up to
two employments —the one contemplation, the
other action; the first a juggling with possi-
bilities; the second a grappling with things
as they are. It is true that thought with-
out necessary relation to reality is barren, “a
vain and idle philosophy, an occupation for
those who have nothing to do” ; it is equally
true that the social value of the noil-contem-
plative, materialistic cynic is just nil. Here,
as elsewhere, the middle way is the best; the
golden mean is the choice of him who relates
all action to the rational ideals which his
spirit entertains.
I do not say the pessimist is ultimately
wrong in his premises; that is not a matter
which admits of proof or disproof. It is
not open to demonstration as in itself true or
false. But Ido say that, when the propa-
gation of a creed promotes a harmful re-
action upon society, then that creed may be
—must be —rejected by society as tending
to its own disadvantage. Our only criterion
of value, for social purposes, is the negative
one—if a process fails, discard it.
There are plenty of “J.8.1-Vs” in this
world to tell us that society “lacks the will
to be Christlike”; plenty of “M.B.’s” and
Jack Lindsays to deride Utopias; plenty of
fools to mock at that which they do not
understand. Of course one does not seek to
deny the obvious fact that there are grounds
for hopelessness in one’s outlook upon human
affairs in general, and the rapid disintegra-
tion of civilisation in particular. But the
bewailings and lamentations of all the Red
Page philosophers joined in one doleful
chorus are not going to do much for the
good of humanity. They are certainly
going to do a lot of harm. Undoubtedly lie
is blessed who expecteth nothing, for verily
he will not be disappointed; but doubly
blessed is he who hopes for something, for
the hope is the father of the realisation, the
dream the shadow of the reality.
Hegel once said that experience never
taught any nation anything. There may be
some truth in that. Europe has known
many wars, each bloodier than the last. But
whether such a statement is justifiable. or
not, it remains true that progress springs
always from an idea; ideas grow into ideals,
ideals into institutions. The idealist believes
in humanity, finds in the community the
centre for the individual’s self-realisation, is
convinced that freedom is nothing but the
achievement of a practical co-ordination of
private with public good, deifies self-control
and self-sacrifice as the apogee of man’s
course. He believes in democracy, even
while he is confronted with delicately-con-
trived ballot-boxes and sees legions of ghostly
electors flocking to the noli. The real
essence of government he discovers to be no
mere external superimposition of arbitrary
caprice or of dictatorial sovereignty, but
rather an expression of the life of a people
which wills the Right and the Good, and in
so doing makes legality conform to moralitv.
A dream? Perhaps; yet sometimes, on wak-
ing. the memory of a fancied yision lingers,
coloring the dreamer’s philosophy. Pessi-
mism is merely philosophism ; it is no true
philosophy, for a true philosophy “sees life
steadily and sees it whole.”
So God save us from the sceptics! May
their number be few and their shadows
meagre in the fair land which is given them!
BRIAN C. FITZPATRICK.
A Satchel of Books
The Talking Woman, by Horace Horsnell (Basil
Blackwell). The creature would have been better
stillborn. There seems to be no reason for her.
She is trite and commonplace.
Sarah Bernhardt, by Sir George Arthur (Heine-
mann). The book is mainly a recital of the Grand
Sarah’s triumphs; from its pages one gets an unfor-
gettable glimpse of the actress’s indomitable will of
which her unconquerable courage was true child.
.In Anthology oj Christmas I'oems for Children
(Basil Blackwell). Florence Hyett has chosen with
discrimination 50 sets of verse by such writers as
William Blake, George Macdonald, Chesterton, Mar-
tin Luther and Herrick. All are simple without being
maudlin, and will make an appeal to the child-mind
from six to sixty-six.
Antic liay, by Aldous Huxley (Cliatto and Hindus).
The wittiest of all Huxley’s books —and the worst
written. The characters are mere puppets, incon-
sistent and unconvincing, while the theme of the
novel is like a labyrinth. On the other hand the
central idea is distinctly amusing.
June —Our Stranger, by Mary Borden (Heinemann).
An interestingly written story, the components of
which are an old, impoverished French family and a
healthy-minded American girl imprisoned in their
cold-blooded, over-civilised circle by the possession
of too many millions. It is a brutally frank study
of the miseries of some of her compatriots married
to the high nobility because of the girls’ money: a
sharp weapon in the revolt against those U.S.A.-
Continental unions now exercising the American mind.
The Florentine Dagger, by Ben Hecht (Boni and
Liveright). Hecht is a Yankee journalist and critic
who is alleged to have “written” this detective story
in 10 hours. He has,' anyhow, contrived an ingeni-
ous mysterv, which, while sparing in the matter of
false scents', leaves the reader baffled up to the final
chapter. Five weird drawings by Wallace Smith,
who is apparently trying to keep Aubrey Beardsley’s
method green, profess to illustrate the spirit of the
narrative.
Seraph Wings, by Arthur Lynch (John Long).
This extraordinarily brilliant Australian, besides
being engineer, lawyer, doctor and soldier, has been
a member of the House of Commons, too; and in
this story he tells how Austin Grainge became Prime
Warden of the Republic of Britain, and what he did
when he “arrived.” Fortunately in a romance of
this sort your “Prime Warden” —really dictator -
doesn’t have to get down to details ; and sordid con-
siderations of finance are dismissed as too dull alto-
gether. And then you can kill your dictator just
whenever you can’t otherwise get him out of his
difficulties; and you are not interested in his sue--
cessor. Of course the thing is well written ; and Lynch
is far too good a workman to omit the sentimental
interest. But why did he make the U.S. Ambassador
talk like a cheap vaudeville “turn” from the
Bowery ?
“Black Out”: R.L.S. needs no one to defend him:
but one is subconsciously interested in Helen and
“M.G.S.’s” child-knowledge (R.P. 7/2/’24). ‘ M.G.S.
might read this famous little rhyme, written for his
children bv a notorious Apache, to Helen: —
“Should I cry if daddy smacks me,
Cos I pinched knives from ’is shelf?
No, I think that daddy orta
Love his darling little dorta,
And I’m sure mv mummy backs me —
Daddy orta smack ’isself.”
Or this rarer yet far more popular Stone-age rhyme
which children who tore meat with both hands used
to love mamma to croon to them long, long ago:—
“ ‘Mother, I’ve gone and hitted dead our Willy.’
‘Oh, dear, that was a pity, Millv;
And me just cuttin’ up papa’s old suit
For the poor dear little brute.’ ”
Anv unhappy child who prefers Dennis’s “Book for
Kids” to R.L.S.’s “Child’s Garden of Verses ought
to relish such literature. Still, Helen may only be
unfortunate in her choice of adult companions.
Things that are damned by the same things ano
damned by one another.

THERE is sound farming sense in fallowing immediate y
after harvest. It uproots the weeds, it opens up the soi
to the beneficial influence of sun and wind it takes lull
advantage of rain and moisture, it means better cultivation an
better results. But it is only possible to the man who has ti
powerand equipment necessary. If. he employs horse teams they
will surely need a rest after the strenuous days of harvesting.
With a CASE Tractor it is different—as soon as one jo is com-
pleted it is ready for the next—it never tires it will work mgn
and day - whenever and wherever it is needed. This serves to

Australians.
How gently in Australian earth
Her well-belov&d dreaming lie;
Soft August grasses, in their mirth,
Dance o’er them as the winds go by.
Yet where their quiet steps have trod
The brown path grows more homely-sweet;
And all the land is nearer God
Because of passing human feet.
And where their voices once were heard
There lingers on remembering air
Some echo of a braver word
Than men have spoken otherwhere.
Not exiles under alien skies,
But close against a mother’s breast,
In a great quietness grown wise,
They are at home and take their rest.

Beyond the Hedge.
If you should come to the meadow gat6
And lay your hand on the latch,
The hedge will show you a blue smoke curl
And the golden brown of thatch.
There you will guess at an unseen well,
And a rope that is woven strong,
And a wooden bucket that smells of pine
Gone dipping deep for a song!
Is the glimmering square of the hidden well
By water-spiders crost?
Does the bucket shatter the rainbow-rim
Of a moon the sky has lost?
Is it slabbed with planks from the forest oak
That keep in their sodden grain
The motes that danced from a bygone sun
To the harping of the rain?
What comes xxp from the unseen well
In the bucket of apple-wood?
Is it a fish with jewelled scales
Or a maiden’s velvet snood?
Is it a rapier rusted red
That splashed there long ago?
Is it a glove all dark with slime
That covered a wrist of snow?
This none may know, for the way is barred
That lies through the hedge of green ;
And no man yet through the meadow gate
To the goal beyond has been.
Yet each one dreams of a lifted latch
And a green, inviting track,
And a rope of stars to a pixy well. ...
While a gate swings slowly back.

To Sea.
West the wind and fresh and free,
Early sunshine glowing;
Yon’s a ship that puts to sea—
Whither, whither going?
Soft as wool and white as wool
Lies the wake she traces;
Mainsail full and topsail full,
Through the Heads she races.
As she rides the ebbing tide,
Crest and hollow meeting,
Leaps a porpoise at her side,
Glad to give her greeting.
As the west wind spurs and goads,
Through her cordage humming,
Many are the azure roads
Waiting for her coming.
Roads with neither rail nor post,
Roads where dolphins revel,
Roads that lead from coast to coast,
Blue and broad and level.
Swift as gannet, white as gull,
Through the Heads she races,
Proud and brave and beautiful.
Storm and calm she faces.
East by south or east by north,
Glad of wind and water,
Gay of gait she ventures forth,
Like a sea-king’s daughter.

When I Come Back.
Oh, there’ll be columbines ablow
Within the garden gates I know
And in each dewy blade of grass
A sunbeam twinkling as I pass.
A day of sun and scudding cloud
Shall spread the dahlia banners proud,
And teasing wind apd sleety rain
Color the clay-red path again.
The currant bushes in a row,
TTnpruned, will straggle high and low,
And close beside, where no one treads,
Purple clovers lift their heads.
And I will call, and laugh and run
Through the wide door as I have done
So often in the years before —
Laughing, pass through the open door!
And, restless, yon will move about.
And, some old memory leaping out.
Whisper: “The wind laughs gay and low,
Just like a girl I used to know.”
Oh, there’ll be columbines ablow
Within the garden gates I know;
But the wind and the clovered grass,
Not Man, shall see me pass!

What people want to know concerning the latest HUDSON Product
The LAYMAN.
The new Essex Six, a liigh-efficieney
light-weight (approx. 1 ton) machine, Avhich
supersedes the Essex Four, surpasses all
expectations as an attractive car for Aus-
tralian owners. Its new motor, Avhich is
tremendously powerful, is exceptionally
economical in the use of fuel —that it will
do twenty-four miles per gallon is a .very,
conservative statement. The engine, whilst
it retains many of the features which did so
much to establish the wonderful reputation
of the Essex Four in the past, has been de-
signed more on the principles of its big
brother, the Hudson Super Six. This “Six”
continues the qualities of efficiency and relia-
bility that are knoAvn to 135,000 owners of
Essex “Fours,” whilst, through the improve-
ments to its motor, it gives that smoothness
of performance formerly only associated
with largest and most costly cars.
-The car provides comfortable accommoda-
tion for live passengers. The seats are Avide,
deep and restful, and leg-room in both front
and rear compartments is ample. The springs
are now longer, and minimise surface
inequalities to such an extent that riding at
high speeds on rough roads is possible with-
out any appreciable loss of comfort. The
special manner in which the chassis is de-
signed gives an exceptionally loav centre of
gravity, and makes the new Essex possibly
the safest car on the road to-day. As oilers
are fitted, the car can be completely lubri-
cated Avith an oil-can, in a very few minutes,
and the filling of messy grease-cups and pres-
sure grease-guns is dispensed with. Accessi-
bility is an outstanding feature of the car.
Cord tyres, 31in. x 3|in., are supplied, the
spare at the rear. The petrol tank, which
is also at the back of the car, holds 8 gallons,
and the filler is very accessible, being situ-
ated on the right side of the tank.
Equipment includes spare rim, tyre and tube and
full kit of tools, radiator shutters, Boyce moto-
meter, speedometer, thief-proof lock, cowl ventilator
and numerous other advantages that will irresis-
tibly appeal to the purchaser, as well as the car’s
nimble ease of operation.
Summed up, the Essex Six is powerful and fast,
light and economical, simple to maintain and
delightfully easy to handle.
The ENTHUSIAST.
- The 6-cylirider Essex has a bore and stroke
of 2fin. x 4in., and is designed on tlie most
modem lines. Its E.A.C. rated horse-power
is 16.5, but at 3300 revolutions per minute
it will develop over 50 brake-horsepower;
Hudson patented scientific balancing makes
this possible.
The tremendous reserve of power and the
high revolutions make speeds in the vicinity
of 60 miles per attainable, and the stan-
dard gear ratio of 5.6 to 1 gives top-gear
efficiency and swift pick-up in traffic to a
degree that will satisfy the most exacting
champion of flexibility.
The clutch is the well-known Hudson cork-
insert' multiple disc-in-oil type, and the
gear set has three forward speeds and reverse.
'The long semi-elliptic springs and the- low
centre of gravity and consequent freedom
from side sway, combine in enabling the car
to cling to the roadway, so that the superior
driver can safely gratify his tastes for high
speeds and fast cornering, even on rough sur-
faces. The car steers with exceptional ease,
in fact, almost like a bicycle.
The brakes are particularly efficient, act-
ing on the 14-Jin; drums on rear wheels. The
entire electrical system is American . Bosch.
The wheels are wood, or wire at extra cost,
and tbe wbeel-base is 110-J inches. A
feature of the car is its lowness, the' top of
the hood being only sft. lOJin. above the
ground, and the frame members are only
19 inches above the ground, and this lowness
greatly enhances the car’s appearance; at
the same time the road clearance is all that
could be desired.
In designing this car the makers have
regarded carefully the present-day condi-
tions, when so many owners are enthusiasts
who attend to their own cars, consequently
accessibility and convenience have been
attained in the mechanical parts to a very
marked degree.
The ENGINEER.
Most certainly the trained mind will recog-
nise to the greatest extent the remarkable
excellence of the ESSEX SIX. Engineers
will appreciate the high mechanical prin-
ciples used throughout the chassis. They
will perceive the marvellous manner in which
the design lends itself to successful quantity
production; how parts have been turned out
by automatic machines that ordinarily would
have required hand work entailing greater
expense and less accuracy. There is no
wasted time or labor on the ESSEX SIX —
the result of recent complete reorganisation
of the HUDSON Factory, which made it the
world's most modern and advanced automo-
bile works.
. The engine is L-head type, piston displace-
ment 130 cubic inches. Compression is
moderate. Suspension at 4 points. Pistons
are split-skirt type of lynite, 3-l/16in. in
length, with three rings above wrist-pins.
Connecting rods are I-beam drop-forgingS.
Crankshaft is the HUDSON patent counter-
balance design, 2fin. diameter. Three main
bearings, lfin., lfin. and lfin. in length.
Combustion chambers are carried in the
detachable cyhnder head, and are of tapered
section, with their highest point above the
valve chamber.
The camshaft is driven by Morse adjust-
able silent chain lfin. in width. Valves
have roller tappets, and are interchangeable.
The roller guides and pins are manufactured
to tine limits, being ground all over. The
flywheel is a plain steel disc fin. thick, with
starting-gear teeth cut directly info it.
Lubrication is circulating splash system. Pump
designed to deliver correct quantity of oil in rela-
tion to engine speed.
Carburetter is of special HUDSON design, very
accessible. Cooling by thermo-syphon. Fan is
pressed steel with four blades. Gear case is
aluminium. Hotchkiss drive. Tubular propeller
shaft with two Spicer universal joints. Seim-
floating rear axle mounted on Timken bearings
throughout, fully adjustable. .
Steering is by worm and full worm wheel, is fully
adjustable and very accessible. Springs semi-
elliptic—front 36in. long, rear 55in. long. *- no
rear springs are set in towards the front, and are
outside the frame members, which are 2Sin. apart
and parallel. Frame has five cross members.
Body is mounted outside the frame on six brackets,
which is one of the factors which contribute to the
lowness of the car.

NATIONALISM, REAL AND BOGUS.
By their attitude to Australian manufac-
tures Governments which call themselves
“Liberal” and “Nationalist” are encompass-
ing their own destruction. At a time when
it is urgently necessary that work should
be kept in the country, these Governments
are found knocking bricks out of the tariff
wall raised by Parliament for the protection
of Australian manufacturers, and sending
contracts abroad in preference to getting
them carried out by their own taxpayers.
At a time when the international situation
has been radically changed by the termina-
tion of the Anglo-. Japanese alliance and the
advent of a pacifist Government in Britain,
these Governments, devoted to a brummagem
ideal of cheapness, are endangering the
existence of industries as essential to the
national safety as rifles, aeroplanes and
warships. Demoralised by foreign borrow-
ing, they are increasing the flow of imports,
already too great, for all they are worth. In
an evil moment for Australia one of them
hit upon the notion of asking the Tariff
Board to recommend the removal of the
duties on its foreign purchases. The favor
was granted, for, under the weak administra-
tion of Austin Chapman, the pre-occupied
Minister of Customs, Tariff Board recom-
mendations are regarded as instructions, to
be obeyed without hesitation; and the favor
is now asked for as a matter of course. In
the case of material alleged to be required
for the Sydney Harbor Bridge it was granted
without being asked for, or so the Sydney
Government asserts. The process has been
carried to such lengths that contracts are
now entered into in the confident belief that
the duties on the shipment will be waived,
either at once or after the slight delay in-
volved in dealing with the contention that a
boon bestowed on A cannot consistently be
denied to B. And at least one importing
Government has arrived at the conclusion
that it is entitled to remissions of duties
for the asking, that being a State Right.
* * * •
Bakwell, Premier of South Australia,
stated recently that "Australian industries
had the benefit of the highest protective tariff
in the world.” The assertion is incorrect in
all its bearings, and, anyhow, a tariff as
high as the tree on which Hamas was
hanged would have little or no protective
value if it were removable at the whim of
an irresponsible Board on application made
by the largest purchasers of material in
their respective States. No such departure
from the national fiscal policy is permitted in
genuinely Protectionist countries —the
U.S.A., for example. Neither does the U.S.A.
admit goods from low-wage countries with
depreciated currencies at specially low rates
if 75 p.c. of their value has been added in
Britain, a provision which, along with the
moral and actual results of Tariff Board
tinkering and of the craze for buying in
the cheapest market, has reduced manufac-
turers to despair. But the S.A. Premier had
to say something. He has been trying to
justify the policy of employing foreigners to
manufacture goods which can, and should,
be manufactured in his own country, and has
been making heavy weather of it. In the
matter of his Government’s rolling-stock con-
tracts he has added disingenuousness to its
other sins. The Government invited quota-
tions for, among other things, 600 40-ton
gondola cars and 500 30-ton box cars. An
Adelaide firm of manufacturers put in for
both lines. Another firm quoted a price
for madc-in-Australia gondola cars, but
submitted an alternative tender for
the gondola and box cars and 100
louvred vans, specifying that they would
be imported in sections (from America, it
transpires) and assembled in S.A., and that
their total price, £1,027,505, was contingent
on the whole tender being accepted—•
as it was. Barwell has gone about
South Australia declaring that the State
would “save” £288,000 by placing the
order for 1100 cars with Firm No. 2
instead of Firm No. 1. Figures pub-
lished by his imported Railway Commis-
sioner show, however, that the people who
quoted £754 each for American gondola cars
were prepared to do the job in Australia for
£9OO each, a difference of £57,600 on the 600
cars; and that the other S.A. manufacturer
quoted £1155 apiece for all-Australian box
cars (£577,500 altogether) against £938 apiece
(£469,000 altogether) for those to be made in
America and assembled here. Therefore the
“saving” will be £91,900 less than the amount
mentioned by Barwell in his repeated at-
tempts to justify the unjustifiable.
* * * *
Against these “savings,” of which the Bar-
wells boast, are to be set the losses, to which
they never refer—losses of income by the
manufacturers and the producers of their
raw material; of direct and indirect taxes by
State and Commonwealth Governments; of
wages by the workers w T ho might otherwise
be employed ; of a certain proportion of their
market by those engaged in growing food-
stuffs, some of whom are in rather a bad
way. If these and related items were worked
out and added up, the “savings” would look
mean. Then there are the losses incident
to banging the door against home-grown
energy and skill and depending on foreign
countries for goods which couldn’t be done
without in time of war. There might con-
ceivably be losses by emigration of valuable
human material which asks for nothing
more than to be allowed to work for the
Commonwealth and, if the need arises, to
fight for it. Were Australia invaded or iso-
lated the foreigner couldn’t do either, even
if he wanted to ; and he might be helping the
hostile army or fleet. All these factors should
be considered in the letting of Government
contracts, great and small. Because they
are being set aside for a cheap importing
policy, alike spurious and suicidal,, men
who have no sympathy with the socialistic
aims of the Labor party are being forced
into its ranks.
THE ART OF INTERNATIONAL
BLUFF.
When Richard of the Lion Heart, chief
knight of the third Crusade, and most negli-
gent of English kings, was cornered by the
Saracens at Joppa and found himself, with-
out supports, facing a large army, he put
up the most picturesque bluff of history.
Mounting his great horse, he rode out alone
to the Saracen lines and announced that he
was prepared to meet their bravest in single
combat. There was no reason why a hun-
dred of the enemy’s horsemen should not
have rushed upon the brave infidel destroyer
of their people and hater of their faith ; but
the certain destruction which the king
courted was delayed by the idea of chivalry.
Not one soldier of Islam was anxious to test
the might of that terrible arm or feel the
weight of that huge mass of hammered steel
which Richard carried as an axe. Taken
at first by surprise, the Saracens debated
their individual chances while the challenger
rode three times along the entire length of
their line. Then the noisy horseman gal-
loped off—and the enemy suddenly awoke
to the fact that his supports were close at
hand! A dozen instances of the same kind
of strategic courage can be quoted. Duncan
with his ships anchored in the Texel and
looking like a decoy, when in reality there
were but two ships in the British Admiral’s
whole command; Cochrane’s magnificent
audacity at Para, where the only ship of
the Brazilian Navy pretended to be a mere
message-bearer for an overwhelming force
outside; the long-maintained siege of Delhi
by a force so small that it would have been
lost in one crowded street of that great city
—these are some of the outstanding in-
stances of aggressive or defensive bluff. But
a close examination of all warlike strategy
shows that bluff is the key to the whole
business. To make the enemy think that
your intentions are other than they are, to
deceive him as to the strength of your forces
at. any given point, to lure him into the place
where you are best prepared to destroy
him —such are the commonplaces of the
big game of destruction. War is, in fact,
bluff all the time; and, provided he lias a
few other qualities, the greatest bluffer is
the greatest general.
* * * *
Considering Australian defence rightly,
and trying to gauge the extent to which any
possible enemy may be bluffed, the one thing
that is certain to-day is that we are not
keeping our end up with any pretence of
skill. Every day almost we discuss our
weakness and attempt to show in a more
or less detailed way the points at which we
are feeblest and the fashion in which a cap-
able enemy ought to conduct his attack. So
long as we do so little to strengthen the
weak places, this plan of gravely fighting
over beforehand the distressing battles of
a serious invasion from the point of view
of the invader is not particularly sane. Yet
the game of exposing Australia is played
with a good deal of enthusiasm. It affords
much the same sort of sensation as the find-
ing of the bloodstain and the minute descrip-
tion of the. life and habits of the murderer
who choked the charwoman with an empty
sauce-bottle. At times the method is varied
by raising scares about espionage—as if any
spies could be necessary. There is no need
for stealthy observations at night of the
back window-catches of a house whose front
and back doors are never shut. Any agent
of a possible enemy who would waste time
in trying to find out more about our defences
than we ourselves advertise must have lots
of time on his hands.
* * * *
Yet it is true that an attempt to use
bluff of any of the common patterns would
have little hope of success in Australia.
Our continent is too vast, our coastline too
long, our population too small to make pos-
sible any tricking of a wide-awake enemy
intp the supposition that we are numerous
or strong. Still, there is a certain kind of
bluff that remains to us ; and it may serve us
and even save us while we are putting our
house in order. Between the years 1815 and
1914 the defences of Britain were often despe-
rately inadequate. We have no reason to think
that Britain in 1914 was inordinately weak.
It is just possible that in no single year of
the whole period was she in a better posi-
tion to meet the terrible calamity of Euro-
pean war. Yet often during the nineteenth
century Britain had incurred quite enough
hate to make some desperate nation think
of leaping at her throat. The safeguard
during all those years was chiefly that
gigantic bluff, the memory of Waterloo and
the Peninsular War. Europe did remember
that small, nasty, hard-fighting British
armies had entered a long continental
wrangle, and that, after nearly a genera-
tion of unpleasantness, they alone were in a
position to continue the murderous argu-
ment. It is possible that a similar bluff
is making and will go on making for Aus-
tralian safety. Our armies in Europe and
Palestine in the Great War proved them-
selves hard, fearless and solidly hurtful
fighters, full of the most wonderful resource.
Those who came up against them were so
effectively bruised as to leave no doubt at
all that an enemy landing upon these shores
in whatever force must with absolute cer-
tainty count upon getting injured. Further, the
Australian had no real hate for his German
or Turkish foe; but he would have quite a
flaming and berserk enmity towards an alien
race attempting to take his country. Weak
as we are, that element of hurt to the
aggressor is a real and valuable piece of
bluff of a sort for our defence. But sooner
or later we must expect the hluff to be
called. In their hearts Australians do not
believe that their country will become the
prey of any people : and there is no reason
at all why we should not assert that belief.
But. holding it and asserting it. we must,
as a necessary corollary, put our ideas of
defence upon a practical basis. The posi-
tion is not hopeless. The future is not
hopeless. Our reputation will help to carry
us through for a good many years to come.
And in those years we can bring up all those
reinforcements which may be necessary for
our salvation if our rights are challenged.
DEGENERATE PARLIAMENTS.
“J.8.D.” makes a suggestion:—
In Ireland people have been known to look in on
what appeared to be a joyous, if inebriated, celebra-
tion, only to find that they were at a wake. Some-
thing of the sort is happening here. The N. S. Wales
Parliament, for example, is as dead, in the sense
that it has ceased to function in a useful manner, as
any unburied corpse that ever gave human parasites
an excuse to acquire free food and drink. The
factors are mainly (1) the members and (2) the
circumstance that almost all the important business
which was dealt with in the past by the House is
now done outside it in the offices of political and
other leagues. It is Secret Diplomacy—one of the
curses that the war was fought to abolish—applied
to the legislative sphere. Unrepresentative diplo-
mats (many of them Foreign Office clerks, of whom
the multitude had never heard) concluded the secret
treaties that led up to the World War, and simi-
larly unrepresentative Labor or anti-Labor bosses,
prohibition officials and so forth present Parliament
with decisions for the party in power to ratify.
It is claimed—sometimes seriously, more often
with a derisive grin—that the remedy lies with the
sovereign democracy: that members who flout the
wishes of the electors can be punished by rejection
at the polls. In practice, of course, it is not so.
Matters have been so arranged, with the collusive
approval of all the parties, that in fully 90 per
cent, of cases the party selection is equivalent to
a gift of the seat. Brown, M.L.A., may be a
professional patriot who refrained from risking his
skin when the Empire was in danger, or a pluto-
cratic socialist, or a platform friend of the down-
trodden worker with a well-founded private reputa-
tion as a sweater, or any other variety of transparent
fraud. The only recourse those who see through his
humbug, but belong to his party, have is to dis-
franchise themselves. For obvious reasons this type
of pliant time-server—-one to whom the general good
is nothing by comparison with the obligation of
serving a clique and so holding his job—is accept-
able to the party managers outside. And the result
is Parliament grows progressively boozier and more
abusive ; scandals, in connection with which large sums
of money are mentioned, crop up every month or
so; legislation shows an increasing tendency towards
sectionalism, and many respectable people who-
might be expected to uphold our Parliamentary
institutions refer to them in the terms they would
apply to a noisome drain.
The first requisite, if Parliaments everywhere
are not to go the way of the horrible example pro-
vided by N. S. Wales, is to take the election of
members out of the irresponsible hands of the bosses.
The designs of these schemers are furthered by many
senseless conventions. It is undemocratic that a
candidate who has failed to secure a given propor-
tion of votes should be compelled to forfeit a con-
siderable sum of money. Every man with a new
idea is a prospective deposit-loser. The practice of
loafing during four-fifths of a session and then
bulloeking a mass of controversial legislation through
both Houses without adequate discussion before
going into recess for the best part of a year puts
a premium on the least desirable sort of Parlia-
mentarian. There is no House in Australia that
averages two hours’ work a day, year in year out;
and much of the work that is done is put through
when members are too exhausted for clear thought.
A Parliament that assembled at 5 p.m. and adjourned
at 7 for five days a week, and met again for a
couple of hours on two evenings of the week, and
went on doing it for nine months out of every 12,
would provide soberly considered and fully discussed
laws, which are the only sort worth having—the
only sort, indeed, that are not a national mcnice.
But the most urgently needed change is in i lie
quality of the members. The reform suggested above
ought to attract a good many business and profes-
sional men, artisans and employees in warehouses,
shops and the like who, at present, are ruled out i,y
the old-world insanity of a series of all-night sittings
for work following on a series of daytime slanging
matches. But the root of the trouble is the super-
stition that every Parliament must be chosen in its
entirety on a fixed day every three years. It is largely
responsible for pre-selection, tied candidates, anil
all the bribery and corruption involved in machine
politics. When the people are only given a chance
to speak during 12 hours in every 36 months, it
is child’s play to stampede them on false issues.
Nothing is easier than to sway the herd mind in
a given direction —provided tile strain on the popular
credulity is not kept up too lcng. After every
election thousands realise that they have been fools!
—over appeals made to their democratic sentiments
by bogus democrats, to their love of Empire by
bogus imperialists, etc. —yet, owing to a mental kink
which is well understood by the Party propagandists,
they are perfectly willing to be fooled again three
years later. This phenomenon is the salvation of
the undesirable representative. He may do little or
no work legislatively speaking, arid may periodi-
cally disgrace himself in the House, and yet tie
certain of being borne bark there, on what is humor-
ously known as “the electors’ day of power,” by the
agency of a suddenly-worked-up blizzard of class or
sectarian hatred.
A possible cure-lies in a variant on a system which
has worked well in one of the best clubs, in the
true sense of the word, in the world. Under its
rules no one comes up for election till he has been
voted for by a certain number of members who
practise his own profession. An undesirable candi-
date may thus be “up” for years, while a desirable
one is successful inside a month. One method cf
applying this principle to Parliaments would be to
ordain, in the first place, that voting should begin
on nomination day. Any number of citizens might,
for example, contest the seat of Smith, M.L.A., the
winner of the right to enjoy the attaching pay and
perquisities for three —or it might well be in this case,
six—years being the man or woman who first secured
an absolute majority of the available votes. The Party
machines, if Partyism still existed, might herd the
usual 30 or 40 per cent, of automatons to the poll
within a few hours of the appearance of the nomi-
nations. But their contract would be a great deal
more difficult than it is at present when the
canvassers or urgers of the Parties are in a posi-
tion to howl at a hesitant elector that if he fails
to act on the spot all his hopes of repelling the
Socialist (or Capitalistic) enemy will be gone for
years to come. The residue would consist of those
who are damned impartially by both sides after
every election for apathy and want of patriotism,
though they are often some of the most estimable
characters in the community who have only failed
to vote because no one has presented himself whom
they consider worthy of support. Under the pro-
posed arrangement they would be able to vote in
their own time and with their minds clear of the
sudden lies and innuendoes that surge up as each
polling-day approaches. If a story was spread to
the detriment of a candidate they would be able
to sift it—-a merely incidental change which in
itself would do much to diminish electioneering
blackguardism, improve the class of persons offering
for Parliament, and generally sweeten the political
atmosphere. Parliament would necessarily fill up
much more slowly than under our absurdly illogical
and unbusinesslike one-day method of selection (a
device which would be little short of ruinous if
applied to the staff of a bank, a great newspaper or
a big store), and so it might be necessary to pro-
vide for the work of legislation to begin when a
membership quota of 75 per cent, had been attained.
And if this blessed hour did hot strike till six
months, or even a year, after the first vote had been
recorded, the situation would neither be without
precedent nor all to the bad. A little good legisla-
tion, preluded by sober, informed and apposite de-
bate, is surely worth any amount of contentious
laws gagged through a dying House in an atmosphere
of beer and blasphemy.
NORTHERN FRANCE IN 1924.
Mr. Bruce, the Prime Minister of Australia,
spent Christmas week in Prance, visiting the
battlefields, and then proceeded to Belgium.
These places, much changed during the Great
War, he found taking on something of their
accustomed aspect. Naturally he went to
Amiens, which is so closely connected with
the Australian troops and their activities. It
has quite recovered its position as the centre
of the French woollen trade, a position it
had, indeed, in the Middle Ages; but, where-
as the spinning and weaving were done by
hand at that time, to-day everything is run
on most up-to-date lines. There are no
industrial centres in Europe quite so effici-
ent, quite so up-to-date as some of those of
Northern France and Belgium to-day. There
is a very good reason for this. The Germans
carried off the French and Belgian plant;
the factory owners received compensation,
and this compensation was liberally counted,
as it was understood that it was to come out ot
the indemnity to be paid by Germany. Nothing
was spared in the way of labor-saving appli-
ances, for it was seen that labor in France
would for many years be both scarce and
expensive. All around Amiens signs of great
trade activity abound. There has been &
great demand for woollen fabrics sincetne
war. Many people had used up all their
clothes and never replaced them, hoping tna
the war would soon be over, and when tne
Armistice did arrive they required complete


outfits. Thus as soon as the looms could
be got going again there was a great demand
tor woven goods.
After visiting the monuments to the dead,
the Australian Prime Minister made a tour
of the Cathedral. During the Great War
churches and cathedrals naturally suffered.
All the contending armies objected to their
Aery existence. It was suspected, and often
with truth, that enemy fire was directed
from the steeples of cathedrals, while they
certainly formed splendid spying-posts. But
in post-Avar days people are glad to find the
ancient monuments still standing. The
treasures in many even of those that were
destroyed are intact. Accustomed to fight-
ing, the North of France and Belgium are
prepared for emergency. At the first alert,
all the church treasures, the handsome vest-
ments and everything of value, are con-
veyed to the crypts by winding stairs.
Mr. Bruce inspected the historic ground
where the Australians fought at Villers-
Bretonneux, and then went on to Bapaume
and Arras. All this country, in spite of
renewed activity, still bears the scars of
Avar. Marshy country, the grass has grown
knee-high over the battlefields. Some of the
houses are of the reinforced concrete so
popular in France to-day, but there are here
still many huts of hastily-flung-together
Avar material. Some houses still stand as
the Avar left them, the roofs fallen in; but
in spite of this they are used by inmates,
Avho dAA’ell in the cellars and lower rooms.
Other people live in mud and Avood huts
constructed with their own hands; for they
were sick of waiting for the properly-
ordained authorities to come to their rescue.
One hears disheartening stories of faioritism
and occasionally hints of corruption.
While many inhabitants of the war zone
returned for sentimental reasons, there are
others avlio Avent back drawn by other mag-
nets. As the war came nearer and nearer,
many peasants hid their valuables in the
ground, digging holes that they located by
certain trees. They trusted that they would
find the landmarks when they returned.
Sometimes all was well. The three apple-
trees, for instance, stood where they had been
before the war. Measuring three yards from
the farthest tree they found their store of
gold intact. In other cases the ground had
been entirely ploughed up by shell-fire, the
trees cut anti gone. In some families every-
one who knew the secret was killed, either
during the bombardment that sent , them Hy-
ing from the farm or factory, or later in the
Avar. The ground which is known or sus-
pected to hold treasure is carefully digged
oA-er in these circumstances. Sometimes
strangers who have taken over ground left
without owners, everyone concerned having
been killed or having disappeared, have be-
come suddenly wealthy, no one knows how.
They were tin; fortunate finders of treasures
hidden in the earth or behind wainscots. The
inhabitants of Amiens and Arras, however,
do not need these adventitious aids to riches.
Their industry is the surest means of enab-
ling them to recuperate their lost fortunes,
and they are losing no time in repairing the
ravages of war.
After A’isiting the north of France, Mr.
Bruce went to Yjires, the centre of a cer-
tain portion of the textile trade in Belgium.
Left at the Armistice a heap of ruins, it is
to-day a humming beehive. Great building
operations are being carried on. It was the
first city in the war zone to make its own
bricks. Other towns waited for the Govern-
ment to supply them with' materials. Ypres
just set to work and turned the clay round
about the town into material for building.
There is little to remind one of the war in this
active centre excepting the Cathedral and
the Cloth Hall. Out of respect for the wishes
of the British who fought there it was de-
cided to leave the beautiful ruins as they
Avere; but the action of water and frost on
the crumbling remnants is fast reducing them
to powder. The Yprois, avlio hate the ruins,
look forward to the time when they can
rebuild their Cloth Hall, the centre of an
active cottage industry. To that historic
building strangers from far and wide came
to chaffer for the linens for which the town
is famous. Ypres now has several banks, for
since the war banks are springing up every-
where in Europe. The splendor of the build-
ings shows wliat an active trade is being
done, the varying exchanges making business
brisk. Hotels are opening to right and left;
although somewhat primitive for the most
part, they afford much-needed accommoda-
tion for people who Avant to visit graves in
the neighborhood.
One curious effect of the war is noted in
Northern France and Flanders: dozens of
plants are blooming that have never been
seen before in this part of the world.
Mount Kemmel, for some reason that it is
impossible to divine, is a regular botanical
garden. As one dodges the remaining shell-
holes, one sees floAvers unlike anything found
growing wild elsewhere in Europe. Here
they are in riotous plenty and abundance. They
hustle each other as the brilliant blue flowers
in the Alps crowd each other in their race for
light and air, and in their profusion seem
to laugh at the gaunt trees that are still a
fearful testimonial to the deadliness of the
gases used around Ypres. Many theories
have been advanced to account for the
existence of these strange flowers on the
battlefields. It is surmised that some of the
seeds Avere brought into Flanders with fod-
der for the horses. But that could hardly
account for all of them.
Practical men ask Avhat effect the presence
of Australians in the textile districts in
Northern France and Belgium may have on
trade. Australia has much wool to sell.
i he looms of France and Belgium are some-
times idle, in these post-war days, for lack
o_t raw material. Most of the communica-
tions between far-off countries haA r e been
established as the result of great upheaimls
Europe owed great things to the Crusades]
Avhich linked up East and West. Austral-
asia seemed far aivay before 1914- since
then it appears to be merely across the

ment. _ Thus there is intense interest in
everything appertaining to Australasia n
France. Articles on her resources, her
trade and politics are appearing in the
leading French journals. So the mnmunh
cations established during the Great War
are likely to be kept up and even amplified.
Trade relations may follow on friendly inter-
course, and certainly the rush to study Eng-
lish by all and sundry in the French and
Belgian textile districts points to an anxiety
on the part of the inhabitants to cultivate
their English-speaking friends.
PARIS.
L. REID.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Imported Goods, Ideas—Everything.
Just as soon as it had been decided that the
Northern Territory should have a second
scrap of isolated narrow-gauge railwmy (An-
thony’s Lagoon to the McArthur River)-as a
sign of genuine progress, the usual afterthought
got in the way. Now constituted authority
is wondering whether a concrete road with
a motor service on it might not be better.
This capacity for viewing a big subject from
every point of the compass shows profundity
and versatility, of course, but it doesn’t take
us forward. When W. M. Hughes came
to high office he inherited a definite obliga-
tion to construct a certain transcontinental
line along a fairly well-defined route. When
he left office there were three or four or
more routes, and a languid controversy as
to whether there should be a railway, or a
motor road, or an air route, and a long-
distance cyclist who had been sent out at
the public expense to advise whether the
bridge over the desert should be of the canti-
lever or hog-backed variety had nearly been
burned dead in a grass fire, and finality was
further off than ever. This gave a number of
deep but slow thinkers time to suggest that
what the country wants isn’t really rail-
ways, buying Australian coal, and, if the
right thing is done, using Australian rolling-
stock, but improved roads, along which
Yankee motor-cars might scoot like hunted
devils, impelled by imported Yankee petrol.
In the vicinity of cities such as Sydney, loan
railroad-building goes on in the vigorous old
way, but in places like the Territory, which
have no political pull, profound considera-
tion of the possible alternative is strongly
recommended as a substitute for action. The
fear of rashly opening up places like the Ter-
ritory, after all these years, would seem to
be a real apprehension, like the dread of
rashly paying off the public debt. The road-
traffic idea is earnestly recommended on
account of its alleged cheapness, but the
cheapness of roads may simply mean that
road accounts are not kept after the manner
of railway accounts. If the Sydney-Parra-
matta bit of highway were debited with in-
terest on the money spent on construction,
reconstruction and repair, and with deprecia-
tion (\A T hich is awful), and credited with
direct earnings (whiph are nil), it might
prove an astonishing instance of frenzied
finance. The road-traffic idea is, however,
imported, and in some eyes importation is
always good. Yet even if Uncle Sam does
road-hog marvellously in his own car, pro-
pelled by his own “gas,” that is no proof
that it would pay Australia to hog on any-
thing approaching the same scale in a foreign
car, as he mostly does, and with foreign
fuel, as he practically always does. And
Uncle hasn’t really begun to consider the
road vehicle as a substitute for railway tran-
sit, which is the reason why he maintains
nearly 11 times as many miles of line as
Australia does on a similar area, and still
adds a trifle to the total. It is almost pos-
sible to come to the conclusion, in fact, that
Australia imports too many things, and
especially unsuitable things. Besides oil and
cars and grotesque inspirations, one of its
States lately imported a U.S. railway man-
ager, and he is importing U.S. material of
strange devices, which can’t be duplicated
here unless local manufacturers get costly
new plant to do mere odd jobs. Most other re-
cent orders for railway apparatus seem to
have gone abroad, including S.A.’s order for
a dozen motor-trains and N. S. Wales’s for
50. Sydney hopes to have its harbor spanned
in time by an imported bridge. Hosiery and
other mills are in difficulties owing to huge
importations of goods from countries with
high tariffs and cheap currencies, and of
goods which get a superficial finish in Eng-
land and then come here under shelter of
the British preference. The arrival of a
vessel with maize from the highly-colored
Union of South Africa was noted the other
day. Even prohibition and bootlegging may
arrive from oversea almost any moment.
«
Mcßamsay in Search of a Remedy.
No news pours in from England showing
that the Labor-Freetrade Government has
made conspicuous progress at finding work
for the unemployed, though there is no lack
of unemployed to experiment on. Consider-
ing how short a time the Macdonald Min-
istry has been in office, it would be unrea-
sonable to complain of the delay save for
two circumstances. One is that the official
“slogan” (that is the orthodox word, especi-
ally as the Prime Minister hails from the
land where the wild slogans grow) is “Work,
not alms,” yet the Government is busy find-
ing alms, not work. The other is the
complete and continued lack of a single con-
crete proposition for creating more work,
such as ex-Prime Minister Baldwin had.
Mis enemies said his idea was a bad one,
but it was at least a definite idea, and ready
for immediate use. The new man has cer-
tainly laid it down that the militaristic and
Junker spirit should be “eradicated,” which
could probably be done by (hanging the
Junker high enough, and that France and
Britain should combine to “eradicate” evil
in Europe. But these pious aspirations
aren’t beef and bein’. And meantime it is
on record that the United States now sells
far more raw cotton to Germany than to
•T. Bull’s country, which implies that the
Hun mills are the busier, and that trade is
still leaving Britain, and that llans Bock
has good money to pay with when he likes
to produce it. But in spite of apparent
barrenness and futility the Labor-Foreign
Trade combine is at least attempting things.
It proposes a compulsory maximum- 48-hour
week, which will tend to diminish produc-
tion a little if it definitely tends any way,
and the struggle to compete against highly-
protected lands like Germany, France and
the U.S. is dreadful enough already. The
skimpy old-age pension of 10s. per week is
to be increased, which is a thing worth doing
even if the Treasury has a lean and hungry
look. But the outstanding feature is a pro-
posal to extend the unemployment relief
system which the dashing Lloyd George
started, partly out of loan funds, and
this suggests patient acceptance of the
fact that the Big Spectre has come
to stay in Cobden Land. It is
freely alleged that in centres where
the elected local authority is of an “ad-
vanced” socialist type the subsidy from the
local rates, added to the Government dole,
makes being unemployed a poor man’s most
profitable avocation, provided he has the
ear of the elected local authority. As a re-
sult rates (payable by the tenant) become
a more wondrous thing every time a fresh
batch of information is shipped out from
Cobden Land. Taking England and Wales
as a whole, the average tenant whose shack
was valued at 20s. per week rent paid at
last accounts also 14s. 9|-d. per week in
rates; but in places where the population
was poor and the clamor for relief large,
the burden on the average householder
grew remarkable. The prize position, in
1922, was held by Ebbw Vale, in Lloyd
George’s country, where a rental value of
20s. per week carried with it a liability
for 345. 7d. per week in local taxes. The
average rate all round has much more than
doubled since the last year of the war. When
the factory-owner in a small way pays on
this scale, and contributes to the new Gov-
ernment unemployment insurance fund in
addition, and is exposed to the unrestricted
competition of communities with high tariffs
and low-priced currencies, his front door is
apt to close automatically, especially in the
very localities where it is most essential
that it should remain open. Almost any
door would close. Statistics may not be ail
they seem, but at least they have a value.
The “Statesman’s Year Book” (last issue,
1923) records that the outdoor paupers of
England and Wales (apart from inmates
of workhouses, who are mostly old and per-
manent) increased from 376.258 in 1921 to
1.183,439 in 1922. The meaning of this is that
the artificial prosperity produced by the limit-
less expenditure of loan money came to an
end, and in the new post-war world the
country was up against the alternatives of
Protection or pauperism. It chose pauper-
ism—a substance which can be got in large
quantities at short notice. The fact that
the only remedy which the new Government
has so far devised is more of the disease
can’t be described as cheering.

The Stonebroke Settler.
Colebatch, the Westralian Agent-General,
rhapsodising in London on the gorgeous re-
sults-of Mitchell’s loan-settlement policy in
1908-11, said it was “the first large-scale
experiment in placing comparatively inex-
perienced men on virgin land in untried
localities,” and “with very few exceptions
these men are now prosperous farmers.”
The Bulletin put this statement to the test
in one of Mitchell’s “untried localities.”
Exclusive of dummies and speckers, there
were 14 original settlers, and subjoined is
their history, as far as it can be pieced
together:—
Binks was an experienced farmer who had shifted
to new country and picked his block with care.
He had good horses, implements and machinery, a
hit of money in the bank, and —best of all—lo
children, most of them capable of working; and
they worked like beavers. Binks has succeeded,
but he would have succeeded anywhere.
Jinks Avas used to bushwork and had a little
capital. He toiled like two men, but was almost
at the end of his resources when the call for
soldiers came in 1914. Invalided home in 1916,
he carried on with the repatriation loan, and two
or three good crops put him on his feet. Jinks
is ahead of it.
Spinks took up more country than he could man-
age, and became heavily involved. When the situa-
tion seemed hopeless he got a Government billet in
another district and never came back. The Agricul-
tural Bank was left with his land, on which it
had advanced thousands —not so very long ago the
Bank had 800 abandoned farms on its books.
Spinks, junior, brother of the foregoing, also
borrowed heavily and faded out of the picture
rather early.
Ivan and Khsta Blitzovitch were Southern Slavs.
They lost their land, and everything but what they
stood up in, after the 1911 drought.
Jorrocks, an English immigrant, who came by
way of Canada, didn’t stay long. He said he
couldn’t endure the life.
The Horrocks brothers, also British immigrants,
stayed longer than Jorrocks and failed for a much
larger sum.
Joneson is the poorest farmer in the district
and has the hungriest stretch of ground. A favorite
recreation of the other cookies is calculating how
much his futile operations have cost the State
Industries Assistance Board.
Brownsmythe, a courtly youth from the city,
pottered about for a year or two and then decided
that he didn’t like the bush. Parchment, another
city-bred cultivator, reached the same conclusion
in about the same time.
When Flitter read Mitchell’s pamphlet on how
to become a successful cocky without capital, he
was a hairdresser. When he left the district there
was a consensus of opinion that lie should have
kept on cutting hair.
Barebones was the oracle of the settlement and
knew the .“Encyclopaedia of Agriculture” backwards.
He was last seen in Perth, trying to get a billet.
This group of settlers occupied a good belt
of country, on the whole (this year 75,006
bags of wheat have reached the siding), and
the top price in 1909 was 10s. per acre, pay-
able in 40 half-yearly instalments. Loans
for ringbarking, scrubbing, burning-off, dam-
sinking and fencing were advanced by the
Agricultural Bank. On the certificate of a
neighbor that the work had been done tins
bank paid over the full value of these im-
provements, the theory being that an indus-
trious man could make enough in this way
to keep going until he became a prosperous
agriculturist. One bad season shattered that
idea. The Seed Wheat Board, which arrived
in 1912, found it necessary, not only to make
advances of material and send out water
trains wholesale, but also to grant exemption
from payment of rents and bank interest.
Even so, the brothers Spinks and Blitzo-
vitch, and hundreds in other districts,
walked off their holdings. After the general
crop failure in 1914 90 per cent, of Mit-
chell’s settlers were oil the rocks. Then
was created the Industries Assistance Board,
which extended the S.W.B.’s scheme of bene-
fits to everything required by the cocky in
carrying on his business—-seed, fodder,
manure, tools, machines, parts, horses, carts,
insurance, cornsacks and twine. It even
paid him wages, acted as his agent and
accountant, and protected him from his pri-
vate creditors, many of whom sold their
claims to the Government cheap. This re-
markable body is still in existence. At
June 30 it had lent the “1.A.8. farmers”
£7,204,160, all borrowed at 6 per cent, or there-
abouts, and £5,646,887, including interest, had
been repaid, “bad debts, etc.,” being estimated
at £129,241. It has certainly saved some
settlers who were worth saving; on the other
hand, it has notoriously been a rock of refuge
for hopeless cases who have been wasting
their time and the country’s lucre —persons
who have never learned to farm propejrly
and never will learn. Yet, with the State
Agricultural Bank to lend them money for
improvements, and the Wheat Board to
grant seed and water and remit interest and
rent, and the Assistance Board to supply
everything except labor, together with wages
and a share of the profits, if any—with these
advantages, and f.a.q. wheat land, and only
two bad seasons in 14 (and in one of those
Binks got a crop), the majority of the
original settlers have disappeared from The
Bulletin’s typical district, and their depar-
ture was compulsory. The same is no
doubt true of other Westralian localities; it
is true, indeed, of every State in which fool-
Governments have tried to make farmers of
city tyros with the maximum of credulity
and the minimum of cash. In the present
financial situation, and in the light of what
has happened to thousands of soldier-settlers,
it is the refinement of cruelty to talk as if
street-bred stonebrokes had a natural gift for
farming and a natural right to be put (and
kept) on the land at the public cost. Yet
fluent politicians say these things and keep
on saying them.

Buckley’s Chance in Australia.
It is one of the curiosities of N. S. Wales
Labor politics that expulsion from “the
movement” involves no hardship if the ex-
pelled person has a strong union behind him
or is “in with the clique.” On the contrary,
Alderman Bramston, Bailey, M.L.A. for
Goulburn, and Buckley, ex-M.L.A. fpr Syd-
ney, have rather gained in importance since
they were associated by the A.L.P. executive
with putrid selection-ballots and disqualified
“for life”—which means till the next con-
ference. Bramston has become a power in
the City Council; when resumptions are on
the tapis he votes leasehold or freehold as
the whim seizes him, and with telling effect.
Bailey is still the silent member for Goul-
burn, and his influence in the A.W.U.’s
central branch (which was connected with a
trifling unpleasantness at the A.W.U. con-
ventions, the ballot-papers purporting to
have come from Bongo, Bagadang, Riverside,
Mungulla and Yangara being rejected as
bogus) is stronger, if anything, than ever.
And Buckley is a great circumstance in
the Australian Railway Union, as was shown
during its inter-State conference. Largely
at Buckley’s instance, the A.R.U. decided
to affiliate with the Labor party, whose
executive expelled him and will presumably
re-admit him at Easter. A delegate pointed
out that “there are avowed Nationalists in
the service who vote against the interests
ot Labor,” and who would vote for the weak-
est Labor candidate at the selection-ballot.
To this it was replied that “under Rule 6
an avowed Nationalist could be prevented
from giving his opinions,” the means of pre-
vention being left to the imagination. “This
resolution, if you carry it, is going to make
the union,” said Buckley, who is secretary
of the N. S. Wales district. Carried it was
by 45 votes to 6. Elated at having committed
03,000 Government employees to the finan-
cial support of a particular party, the Con-
ference rapturously received a Russian who
was drumming for Trotsky’s loan, and for-
mally blessed that project; also it extended
A Housing Scheme.

and Calcutta. So much has the Frenchmen’s
trade improved since Australian laws put
Australian ships and shipmen to the bad by
comparison with the foreigner who employs
any color of labor that he can get cheap,
and does not have to pay the Australian rate
of wages to sailors in and out of Australian
ports. Also the Messageries are doing well
out of another line trading from New Cale-
donia to Marseilles via Maoriland and the
Panama Canal, and are taking to Europe the
cargoes which ought to come to Australia
and be paid for with Our manufactures. Fiii,
too. is dealing with the far outsider. The
Commonwealth Government accepted a sub-
sidy from Fiji to run steamers there —until
“fraternal greetings to Soviet Russia.” While
in this exalted mood it deal with the proposal
of a country sub-branch that no levy should
be enforceable unless it had the endorsement
of a majority of union members voting
by ballot. “Did Lenin and Trotsky
put the question of the Revolution to
the people?” asked Buckley. He de-
manded “financial support to fight this
National Government,” and the dele-
gates obliged him, as far as they were able,
by approving of a 265. levy struck by the
Council of the N. S. Wales branch and in-
tended for the expenses of a claim soon to
be heard in the Federal Arbitration Court.
There were obscure persons who considered
that a 10s. levy should suffice; these the
secretary crushed with the information that
“the Amalgamated Engineers spent
£9OOO on their case, and it cost
another £4OOO to appeal.” Which sug-
gests that Federal arbitration is a grand
thing for lawyers and union advocates. Hav-
ing imposed his ideas on the railwaymen
the aggressive young man rushed round to a
conference of State civil servants and advised
them to get even with the FAller crowd —
let them have it in the neck, so to speak—
by registering under the Commonwealth
Arbitration Act. Here, however, he failed
to get things all his own way. Some of ti e
civil servants looked annoyed at the irrup-
tion of an uncouth and truculent Labor
politician (disq.) from Surry Hills, and it
was decided that there would be no Federal
registration for the present, and none at any
time unless the executive recommended it
arid a referendum approved. Still, it must
have been an exhilarating week for
Buckley. His rise to prominence indi-
cates that a Sydney union boss who served
in the war strike, who has been expelled
from the Labor party on a charge of being
a ballot-faker, and who profoundly admires
the Russian Revolution and the methods of
Trotsky, may aspire to any position in Aus-
tralia —-and is likely to get there, too, if the
people care so little about their country and
their own and their children’s future that
they will not trouble to use the brains _ God
gave them or the union and citizen rights
their fathers won for them.

Our Great Natural Paper Resources.
Dear Bulletin,—l have no faith in frenzied
finance, and I have avoided inflation since
childhood. All the same, I think this coun-
try hasn’t sufficient paper money, and that,
if Treasurer Earle Page printed an extra
£5,000,000 worth, and with it paid off that
amount of the soldiers’ gratuity bonds that
are falling due, he would save £300,000
a year in interest and do no corresponding
harm. But I would set aside the interest
saved as a special fund, and thus provide for
the withdrawal of £300,000 of notes annually
in case signs of inflation did appear. At
the end of January the quantity of paper
money held by the banks was £29,0,84,312,
of which £16,850,000 consisted of the
£IOOO freak certificates first issued by the
Hughes Government as a War Precaution
in 1914. At one time, when the late Prime
Minister was holding up the universe single-
handed, there were over £28,000,000 worth
of these useless anomalies in existence, all
held by the banks. The £12,000,000 and a
little more of available paper that the banks
are now possessed of is not large, consider-
ing the thousands of institutions, counting
head offices and branches, which have to
keep a stock on hand. Last Christmas holi-
day season there w r ere expectations of a
famine in the minor varieties of soft money,
owing to the Government machine being
unequal to the public needs, which suggested
that both more money and more machines
were wanted. When the extra £5,000,000
of notes (made, if necessary, on an extra
machine) which were used to redeem sol-
diers’ bonds drifted into the banks, they
would have no over-supply, and unless there
is over-supply inflation hasn’t commenced.
This is a country of dwarf population and
giant finance, and the spectacle of a Gov-
ernment asking for the loan of so
much of its own paper when there is so little
to lend looks humorous in a way, especially
as it is only one of seven Governments, all
asking for more spare money than exists.
At present the gold reserve (£24,737,094) is
more than the value of all the notes “held
by the public,” which, of course, includes an
unknown but always increasing quantity
which are held by nobody, and are clear
profit—those burnt, drowned, blown into the
desert, bitten by wild and tame animals, etc.
The reserve also equals 471 per cent, of the
whole issue. If the issue was £5,000,000
more than it is, the gold reserve would be
43 per cent., and if it was £10,000.000 larger
the reserve would still be 39 per cent. The
law demands only 25 per cent. If the
paper money alleged to be “in cir-
culation” in the United States is to be taken
seriously, that country has, in proportion to
population, twice as much soft currency as
the Commonwealth has. I can’t help think-
ing that if the Australian Treasurer was a
banker of long and hard experience, and
with youthful originality on top of it. instead
of a medico and landowner, he might dis-
cover some great natural resources (perfectly
THE PERIPATETIC RUBBER-STAMP.
“The Minister for Customs (Mr. Austin Chapman) is kept so busy working for the advancement of
Canberra that a doubt has arisen whether he has any time to give to the advancement of Australian
industries.”
the Fijian Government got the trade concen-
trated, whereupon it sacked the Common-
wealth shipowner, and foreign-owned steam-
ers took the business away to foreign parts.
Up in Rabaul they announce with gladness
that the best thing that has happened to
them in a dog’s age is an arrangement where-
by they can send their produce to Europe
cheaper than ever before, mostly taking pay
therefor, of course, in British and Continental
manufactures, and even in flour made from
Australian wheat and meat tinned in Queens-
land, and sent oversea to be thus traded back
again. Breeding cattle are to be imported
into Rabaul. Since Australia took that
country from the Germans and is responsible
for it now, and since Australia is almost
contiguous to it and has any quantity of
good cattle to sell, it might be assumed that
this is where Rabaul would buy its stock.
But Rabaul has got into the way of buying
along the routes where the charges are low-
est, and General Wisdom, the officer in charge
of its administration, said in Melbourne the
other day that they were getting a lot of
their cattle from India. So much for Aus-
tralian business slackness and political thick-
headedness and the Navigation Act! The
sailor wants a good wage, and everybody
wants to see him get it. But we can’t have
our meat on the hoof and in the oven. If
Australia thinks the Island trade worth hav-
ing—with all it means to her manufacturing
industries —she must meet the competitor
with competition. As it is she is letting him
get away with it by insisting on transport
conditions which the customers won’t have
anything to do with ; she is even looking
idly on while he trades in and out of her own
ports with his cheap and piebald crews. If
we got the proportion of the Island and man-
dated territory trade now going to Europe
and America to which we are entitled on
mere geographical grounds, Australian fac-
tories would do a big back trade, and there
would be increasing employment in this
country. And good Australian seamen with
captains’ useless tickets in their pockets
wouldn’t be walking Sydney streets looking
for any kind of job. down to a night watch-
man’s, as they are pitifully doing now. Pre-
sently, the way things are going, we won’t
need any Navigation Act for the Pacific trade,
because there won’t be any navigating to be
done —except by foreigners —between here
and the Islands. The Governments them-
selves don’t draw the color-line or pay white
man’s wages. A few days ago a little
steamer called the Laurabada was slipped
off the Sydney skids, where she had been
built for the Papuan Administration, and
got ready to go where she belongs. Not only
is she to be manned by “natives.” A full
crew of the same was sent to Sydney to man
her, and by this time is probably well on
its way home. Thus do the islanders, under
Australian compulsion, prepare to develop
a seafaring population of tlieir own, to go
out on the wings of the morning and take
and bring Island trade to and from any-
where in the world, except Australia. And
a time threatens when the islands of the
Pacific, with their vast commercial possibili-
ties, will be as irrevocably lost to Australia
as that of Atlantis to the ancients.

The Jingellic “Man-hunt.”
From an Upper Murray man whose judg-
ment is entitled to respect:—
The late tragedy at Jingellic gives one furiously to
think upon two closely cognate subjects—one the
fact that a number of policemen, who at the end
closely approached the hundred, were unable to
apprehend a malefactor of very poor intelligence—
to say the least: —who, sometimes naked and generally
barefoot and unarmed, hovered for nearly a week
within a mile of the police rendezvous, which, it is
hardly’ necessary to add, was the handiest grog-shop.
The poor devil, of course, was finally taken by a
civilian, who, unarmed and thinking no evil, was
going about his task of milking Strawberry. The
full facts of the case will, doubtless, never be made
public, except in the highly improbable contingency
of a Commission being appointed to take all pro-
curable evidence upon oath. At present it can only
be asserted that the conduct of those police detach-
ments—surely men chosen rather as above than
below the average—has left among local tnlookers
a strong impression, not only of incompetence, but,
what seems more remarkable, of complete indiffer-
ence to the decencies of their profession. While
not really expecting any conspicuous intelligence,
nerve or initiative, we feel that they should at
least have “put up a decent bluff,” as the saying
goes. And it is a most uncomfortable considera-
tion that the behavior of these specialists, whom we
maintain to prevent, or at least discourage, crime,
should prove, when we have the opportunity to see
for ourselves, such as must confirm any thinking
person with criminal tendencies in his traditional
contempt for “the force.”
But more uncomfortable still is the further reflec-
tion that anyone depending—as in ordinary circum-
stances we must all depend—on the press reports of
the whole bad business would never imagine that it
was the saturnalia of shirking and stupidity that
it in fact was; but would rather imagine that a
force of picked experts was struggling against tre-
mendous obstacles offered by the cunning of the
criminal and the difficulties of the terrain. Certainly
to one accustomed to read between the lines it might
not be haid to discover that the criminal had no
cunning, at any rate beyond that of a 10-year-ohl
child, and that the whole search was one of much
cry and little wool. But unfortunately not many of
“the wee public” are trained in reading between tie
lines. Let me state that the terrain offered no real
difficulties—was, in fact, favorable to the attack
rather than to the defence. But the true crux of
the matter is elsewhere —that our newspapers are
supposed to exist for the purpose of giving approxi-
mately correct information of passing events, anti
should not, as apparently in this case, prostitute
their primary function for such inadequate considera-
tions as the police may be able to offer in the way
of “inside” and “up-to-the-minute” information. No
one acquainted at first-hand with the actual happen-
ings, and reading the reports in the daily press,
can believe that the press representatives had any
eye for what really was occurring, or cared a tinker's
dam whether the police did anything or nothing, so
long as they had a tale to pitch that would afford
catchy cross-headings. Had one independent re-
porter been upon the actual scene the police “pur-
suit” must have become everything that it was not,
or the Country would have rung with a story of
shameless dereliction which would have cost the
Morse and its heads many uneasy hours and much
concoction of explanations.
Whether, bogged as the nation is in quagmires
of departmental incompetence and irresponsibility,
we can hope for better things or not, at any rate it
has seemed to me a duty to register a protest
against such muddlings, and still more against the
prostitution of the only safeguard we have against
that incompetence and corruption of Governments,
the public press.

“North Terrace” in defence of a municipal
system: —•
“Dr. Nil” (B. 14/2/’24) refers to the abattoir
system of Adelaide as “excessively expensive an I
cumbersome.” He says that the meat is delivered
by the ha If-carcase to the retail butchers after much
delay in slow-going motor-waggons after travelling
from six to ten miles, with no practical protection
from flies and road dust consisting largely of horse
manure. I doubt if he has ever seen the works in
operation. Carcases of beef are delivered in quarters,
while sheep and pig carcases are delivered whole.
The delivery is done in motor-waggons which are
insulated and absolutely dust-proof. Their speed is
about 15 miles per hour. The system is certainly
not cumbersome, while, as to the expense, the total
cost to the butcher for having his stock taken
charge of on the fall of the hammer in the stocK
markets, slaughtering, chilling, and delivering right
into his shop, is -Jd. per lb. In the pre-abattoir
days the butcher had to pay to have his large stoet-
slaughtered and delivered, and he had to maintain
slaughtering premises for small stock and pay a
license therefor. Sundry other expenses, including
the cost of slaughtering, had to be met; so that the
cost now is approximately only a farthing a pound
more than it was in pre-abattoir days. The remark
that absolutely fresh meat never reaches the con-
sumer appears to me to be absurd, for the reason that
stock slaughtered one day is delivered chilled the
next day. Even a butcher killing on his private
premises would not deliver meat to his customers
the same day as it was killed. If the doctor knows
anything about meat at all, he would know that the
chilling of meat improves its quality and digesti-
bility, and chilled meat will stand infinitely more
handling without becoming infected than meat which
is warm. It may interest him also to know that
at the Adelaide abattoirs all the employees handling
meat must pass a medical examination when they are
engaged, and are subject to an examination at any
time. Close supervision is also exercised over all
the shops in the metropolitan area where the meat is
sold to the public.

POLITICAL
POINTS
It was soon made plain that the Soviet
wanted something more than the fraternal
kiss. The very day Russia was recognised
by the sentimental Ramsay Macdonald, Brit-
ish banks and traders began to be approached
by Government agents named Deadbodyoff and
Drinkbloodski, who had big business and
wanted the usual credit now that their native
land had been made an honest woman again.
As the response wasn’t enthusiastic, the ques-
tion arose whether the British Government
wouldn’t go a step further, and guarantee, a
Russian loan, and it will doubtless be in-
vited to do so when Badeggovitch has laid
out his line of action.
Making a further effort to prop up his
tottering Ministry, Premier Lawson has
given lawyer Eggleston, of St. Kilda, a
former caustic critic, the Water Supply
portfolio. By handing Eggleston the job
which he himself had previously held as a
sort of sinecure, Lawson unconsciously but
surely rubbed-in the supercession of Hon.
Minister Gordon, for the latter does know
a good deal about water supply. Law has
now four limbs in the Cabinet, the other
three being Lawson, Robinson and Cohen.
One city lawyer reverenced in the Water
Department for his administration (from
1883 till 189 D) is Deakin ; and next to him
the most notable Minister was Swinburne
(1904-08). Eggleston will help Lawson at
the Treasury, and take charge of the gas
legislation.
The British Under-Secretary for Air De-
fence told an astonished House that “the
war had killed the doctrine that in order
to get peace you must prepare for war,” and
that “the nations that had prepared most
got most war.” Some observers had thought
that ill-prepared people like the Serbs and
Armenians got most war, and Russia, with
its rotten lack of organisation, got what was
left. Anyhow, the Under-Sec., while quite
willing to disband the army and trust all
foreigners, didn’t propose to disband the
police and trust his own people. Yet no doc-
trine of peace, non-resistance and faith in
human nature is worth a rush unless it in-
eludes the disbanding of the police.
An expert, called in to advise, supplied
Tasmania with a business-like idea for iin-
proving its railway finances—a tax of 25
per cent, on the takings of motor-vehicles
wliicli compete with the lines. The railway
is supposed to pay interest on the cost of
its road and to pay for repairs, and in
Tassy’s case these two items eat up between
half and two-thirds of the revenue. So the
motor-man, who just happens on a ready-
made road and uses it, is a difficult competi-
tor. There is small satisfaction in having
such bad roads that he can’t use them.
It looks as if N. s. Wales (the present
generation, anyhow) will never hear the last
of the 1916-17 Government wheat pool. The
thing has been examined by detectives,
accountants, a Supreme Court Judge and
innumerable other investigators, but the bad
odor clings, to it, and when one controversy
dies down another breaks out. Last year it
was announced that the growers had re-
ceived £855,000 more than was due to them,
and that in settling up with the Australian
Wheat Board the N. S. Wales Treasurer had
had to pay £549,000. The Progressives con-
tended that a corresponding amount should
he distributed among the growers. When
the situation was becoming dangerous for
the Fuller Government the Auditor-General's
opinion was sought. That official reports
that the Treasurer was “fully warranted
in” and had “adequate authority for” making
the payment to the A.W.8.. which, consider-
ing that the money was owing, is not in dis-
pute. The Progressives now complain that
the issue as between the Government and
the growers is not touched on in the A.-G.'s
report, and accuse Fuller of having departed
from his undertaking to state the ease pro-
perly. So another political “crisis” is handy,
There is a howl in England now because
the Government has ordered a quantity of

where they can be got cheaper. It is pointed

very thing—make a policy, in short, of em-
ploying people at home to make home re-
quirements—he was turned out of office. The
Freetrader is never game to use his own
port in a storm.
“Bildad” on the power of the union: —
This story concerns a bricklayer who arrived in
N.S.W. with intent to brickie in a land where such
tradesmen are scarce. His reception was cold. He
was told he couldn’t get work unless he joined the
union. He couldn’t join unless two members nomi-
nated him. No one would nominate him without
seeing him at work. They couldn’t see him at work
before he joined because he wasn’t allowed to work
till after he joined. It is nearly time it was decided
that the union of a trade must admit every man
who can prove that he is competent at the trade,
and that the rejectee must have a right of appeal
to a competent tribunal if he thinks he has been
turned down out of malice. The power to keep
men out, and to put them under a ban because they
are out, is too loose and large.
Recess has been no necklace of halcyon
days for Vic. Premier Lawson. Mosquitoes,
bred in the daily-paper offices and occasiou-
ally in the F.U. preserve, buzz about iiis
ears, and annoy more by their hum than
their bite. Lawson derives some consola-
tion from the knowledge that the new Assem-
bly rolls will be ready about the middle or
next month. The Cocky Convention will
then be pronouncing judgment on the Loali-
tion: if its approval is conditional on the
privilege ot contesting seats wherever it
pleases, the composite Cabinet will dis-
appear. Lqual-in-all-tlungs Allan thinks it
is possible to tack on an addendum that
selection of seats shall be a matter ot
arrangement between the Liberal and Cocky
organisations, but he is more sanguine tnan
Ids brethren.

Vic. railwaymen, who asked their Classifi-
cation Board for a rise of 4s. 3d. a day—
from 13s. to 17s. 3d. —have been granted
lid. As approximately 20,000 men are
affected the pay bill will be swelled to the
extent of £280,000 a year or thereabouts.
The higher rate goes back to January 1.
Lawson as Treasurer will have to find the
extra money for six months of the current
financial year, but he has so many troubles
that another one or two will hardly matter.
About Britain’s latest set-back: —
The British dockers go on the simple principle
that it is safer to kick a friend than an enemy,
and this doesn’t make the lot of the Macdonald
Government an easy one. During the trouble of
1923 the leaders of the dockers made a fairly good
bargain, but the Bolshevik element took matters our
of their hands, and ran a chaotic strike which ended
badly. This year the leaders made a really good
bargain for depressed times —an immediate rise of Is.
per day, and another Is. in June. (This would
have given the bosses time to arrange for raising
the charges on Australian wheat, etc.) The Bolshevik
elements got control again, and demanded the
whole 2s. immediately. The Government took a
hand, and the difficulty was understood to be
settled; at least, London awoke one morning, and
heaved a sigh of relief on learning that it was.
By breakfast-time London heaved something else.
The situation which developed was that Macdonald
and Co. were expected, not only to help the dockers
against their employers, but to help the insurrection-
ary crowd inside the union against the recognised
union leaders. When they held up 1100 bags of
oversea mails, so that the steamer sailed without
them, it amounted to an earnest invitation to the
Ministry to use violence towards some of its best
but most embarrassing supporters.
High finance is very high these days.
Russia proposes to demonstrate its return
to honesty by redeeming its old paper cur-
rency at, roughly, one-sixth of a farthing in
the £. Payment is to be made in new paper,
said to be slump proof. The Hun has also
started a new and allegedly rabbit-proof cur-
rency, but nothing is heard about the pay-
ment of anything in the £ on the old lot.
Some estimates have it that Hans made
£800,000,000 of real money by selling his
paper to unwise foreigners who thought it
would recover. Hans didn’t intend that it
should recover.
From the Gallery :
Whilst Lawson is brooding on the prospects of his
Government surviving the Farmers’ Conference in
Bendigo next month, his Liberal Ministers voice
their wounded feelings at every opportunity. For
example, Attorney-General Robinson told a recent
lunch party, at which Half-Prime Minister Page
exhibited a troubled grin, that the agriculturists’
attempt to seize the Dalhousie seat in the Assembly
was a gross trespass, a breach of good manners and
other words to the same effect. Seeing that the
Cabinet agreed to a free run for both Nationalist
and Farmer candidates, Robinson’s comment is either
the howl of a bad loser or an admission that his
section of the Cabinet consented to the arrangement
for the sake of peace and office. Lawson himself is
trying to preserve the Coalition by, among other
things, a Redistribution of Seats scheme which will
add two or three seats to the Assembly without any
reduction of the rural representation. The plan
bears the thumb-print of Farmer Allan.
There is no power under the Vic. Jus-
tices Act to appoint women as J’s.P., and the
Ministry shows no disposition to hurry up
an amendment of the law. If a woman be-
comes a mayor or shire president there is
nothing to stop her going on the Bench, but
as there, is only one female councillor in
Vic. (Mrs. Mary Rogers, of Richmond) there
is not likely to be much of an invasion that
way. Solicitor-General Robinson has been
appealed to : but he would win greater satis-
faction by keeping all J’s.P. off the Bench
in the metropolitan area than by adding to
the list of possible beaks, male or female.
In renewing the interminable wrangle
over the 1916-17 wheat-pool, Bruxner, the
N.S.W. Progressive leader, put these baffling
conundrums to Premier Fuller:—
How did it happen that 2,531,646 bushels were
“lost” in N. S. Wales out of a 32,000,000-bushel
crop, whilst in Victoria, under similar conditions,
only 1,277,175 bushels out of a 50,406,770-bushel
crop disappeared? Why was the N.S.W. wheat sub-
ject to a dockage of £933,819 over and above the
cost of reconditioning? Who will tell us why the
Victorian farmer received 4s. per bushel for
f.a.q. wheat, whilst his N.S.W. confrere has received
3s. 3d., including the so-called overpayment of
£85,5,000? Without that “overpayment” the grower
would have received 2s. 9d., or Is. 3jd. less than
the Victorian grower.
One possible explanation is that politicians
meddled very little with the wheat in Vic-
toria. In N. S. Wales they and their
hangers-on meddled a whole lot.
Labor is in an awkward position over the
Melbourne seat in the Vic. Assembly. It
came out in the Full High Court the other
day that Hayes, its selected candidate, was
sentenced to three months’ imprisonment for
having in his possession goods reasonably
supposed to have been stolen, that he had
served the sentence, and that Judge Woin-
arski had dismissed an appeal. Special leave
to appeal was refused by the High Court.
T. C. Brennan told the Court that Hayes
had merely picked up a hat and tie he saw
lying in the street during the riot that fol-
lowed the police strike. Labor doesn’t want
to risk losing Melbourne, but to turn down
Hayes, who topped the pre-selection poll,
would be difficult. Boyd was the last Liberal
to hold the seat for Liberalism; Hon. Minis-
ter Cohen, it is thought, could win it back.
The increased municipal valuations in
Sydney and suburbs are applauded by the
single-taxer—logically, because he wants to
see the value of land taxed right away. But
they are unjust to the landowner. His
former valuations may have been too low—
generally were, in fact —but the rates were
levied in proportion to administrative needs.
The council decided what money it wanted,
and fixed the rate to earn that amount. Now
the same rates are collected on immensely
higher values, which simply means that the
council has that much more money to squan-
der. In some cases the increased revenue
has gone to the councils’ heads, and loans
have been sought which the councils wouldn’t
have dreamed of asking for under the old
conditions. And with big revenues and heavy
borrowings a drunken jamboree of extrava-
gance has set in almost as bad as the State’s
spending departments are suffering from.
THE SINNER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The union had appointed vigilants to search
out those workers who were supplementing their
day jobs by night work at home. The ‘secret’
workers, it was alleged, did everything possible to
outwit the vigilants, barricading themselves in bath-
rooms, pantries, and all manner of hiding-places.
Some, when detected by the vigilants, dropped their
work and fled.”
I am hiding- in the pantry, with a hefty barricade,
Made of saucepan lids and jam-tins, to avert a pend-
ing raid ;
For our vigilant is coming, and our vigilant’s a
Turk,
And he’s sure to get his shirt out if he finds me
hard at work.
Strike me indigo and purple, strike me also up a
tree !
Here s a pretty' dish of blackbirds for some hungry
majesty!
Cock your left eye through the gviller, and, where
spuds and cabbage lurk,
Snookered well behind an onion you will find me
hard at work.
I’m a sinner, I admit it, and my crime is wholly-
had,
But i took the crooked turning, sinking sadly as
a lad,
And I’ve toiled and kept on toiling, though the
mighty word of Shirk
Has gone out across Australia: “It’s a wicked thing
to work.”
And I sometimes get to thinking, in behind my pantry
door,
Of the things I knew as unions in the days that
are no more—
In the ilays when toilers gathered, from the coast
to blighted Bourke,
And discussed the great to-morrow when we’d all
have plenty work:
When the workers’ cause would triumph, and we'd
lead Australia on
In the vanguard of the nations with the energy that’s
gone,
Leaving but the lurid platforms and the politician’s
smirk,
And the vigilants whose business is to ferret those
who work.
WeU, it really doesn’t matter; yet I fancy, toiling
here,
That the pants of young Australia will get patchy
in the rear,
And perhaps they will be borrowed, when a land
which doesn't shirk.
Sends a broadside down the Harbor and decides it’s
time to work.

This undertaking is soon to be put through
the Vic. legislative furnaces, and nobody can
forecast how it will be affected by the blasts
of hot-air which are being prepared for it.
Periodically it lias been talked at in Parlia-
ment and turned inside out by Royal Com-
missions, while press and public have been
worked up to a white heat discussing prices
and the quality of its product. The climax
was reached last year when, owing to the
colliery strike —supplies are ordinarily drawn
from the Maitland (N.S.W.) field —the Met-
ropolitan rushed around the world seeking
feed for its retorts. It paid as much as
575. 3d. per ton for 20,000 tons of inferior
gas-producing coal from England, as against
325. lid. contract price for Maitland ; and
it pushed up its own prices from 6s. to Bs.
6d. The co. immediately became a popular
cock-shy. Some of the charges had a certain
amount of justification; others were quite
unsupported by facts. Then the Lawson-
McPherson Ministry, with the politicians’
usual concession to noise, rushed in with
two ill-considered bills to amend the co.’s
Act —one designed to control its financial
affairs; the other, to regulate gas produc-
tion. The absurdities of some of the pro-
posals became apparent immediately the
bills were circulated, so, making a graceful
retreat, the Government appointed a com-
mittee of seven to take evidence and submit
findings. Parliament has not been made
much wiser by the investigation. The
Ministry is, nevertheless, still pledged to
bring the enterprise under some form of
control; though whether it will have the
opportunity of doing anything remains to be
seen. At present it is inviting the metro-
politan municipalities to decide whether they
can purchase the enterprise lock, stock and
barrel.
What the public now largely overlooks
is that the 13 p.c. p.a. divs. which
have been paid regularly for many years
give a return on capital actually invested in
the enterprise only a trifle larger than the
“standard rate” (8 p.c.) which the Ministry
considers a fair thing. Besides the paid capital
of a million, shareholders contributed £589,113
of share-premiums; and they are as much
capital as the funds for which scrip was
issued. On total cash subscribed the 13
p.c. gives a return of only 8.2 p.c. The
bad old days of the ’eighties tell a different
story, because on capital, most of which
had been free of any premium, divs. ranged
beyond 15 p.c. Those rates resulted in the
placing of new issues at heavy premiums:—

By ’9l the div. rates on all old and now
capital had soared to 214 p.c., but in the
period of depression following the big boom
they went as low as 8 p.c. However,
those days have gone; most of the old hands
who shared the harvest of 30 years ago have
been replaced by people who, expecting the
co. to repeat the distribution of unreason-
ably high rates of divs., foolishly paid as
much as £l7 per £5 share. Possibly old
Boards did entertain such hopes; anyway,
that is all ancient history, and no sympathy
or financial consideration can be extended
to people who gambled and lost.
The bill presented in August last proposed
to give the co. power to capitalise accumu-
lated share premiums, and it specified a
“standard rate” of 8 p.c. on the total and
on any new capital which may be raised in
future. That rate is a fair basis and has
operated successfully in N. S. Wales —
though, by the way, the bungling of that
State’s Act gave the gas cos. the right to
revalue assets, capitalise all reserves, and
pay 8 p.c. on the total. In “regulating” the
rate of div. the framers of the Vic. Bill
stumbled into the same ditch as did the
N. S. Wales reformers; the payment of the
8 p.c. “standard div.” in Vic. was to be made
dependent on a “standard price,” regardless
of the fact that varying costs of manufac-
ture and distribution must determine what is
a fair selling-price. As a matter of fact,
while the Government’s advisers had arbi-
trarily fixed 6s. per 1000 ft. as the standard
price on which 8 p.c. divs. could be paid, the
certified cost of production in Melbourne
was 7s. 6d.! In the preceding month it
had been Bs. 7d. Assuming that 8 p.c. is a
fair return (and with that rate assured the
co. should command all the new money it
requires), the only satisfactory method of
control is to provide for that rate, and. as
in N. S. Wales, permit a competent tribu-
nal to adjust the selling price according to
the costs of production ruling, and at the
same time limit depreciation allowances and
accumulations for renewals on a basis
adequate for the business. It is practically
certain that in the past the amounts spent,
on works and charged against revenue (the
co. did not have the right under its Act to
make depreciation provisions in the usual
manner) were in excess of actual require-
ments for depreciation; but wMte TT pr wis
done in that way has not visibly benefited
shareholders. Under ordinary circum-
stances that noliev should bare permitted the
co. to pay larger divs.; and the fact that it
did not do so is the most convincing evi-
dence that the business has not been the
money-spinner the public has imagined it
to bo. Any charge of extortion or profiteer-
ing during the past 10 years cannot he sus-
tained by an examination of the full and
frank accounts published during that period.
The only alternative to regulation is the
adoption of the Select Committee’s recom-
mendation that the business he purchased
and “run as a public utility b.v an autho-
rity representing the citizens of the metro-
politan area.” The Commonwealth has had
such a bitter experience of Government-run
industries —Vic. certainly not to the extent
of others —that even if the funds necessary
to effect purchase were available it is ques-
tionable whether consumers would be any
better off. Government interference with
the coal trede—the ininultous arrangement
under which W. M. Hughes normitted the
coal-barons and miners to exploit the con-
sumers without renuirlng a mlblic hearing
as to the justification for higher wages and
prices—has to some extent been responsible
for the cost of Melbourne’s ge S . Municipal
ownership Won’t necessarily guarantee
greater efficiency in the works, nor woiOd
such ownership have a bigger pull than the
eo. in inducing the Maitland miners to be
good boys and not cut off supplies of coal.
The municipalities have had the right to
purchase from the day the eo. was estab-
lished : but the terms provided bv th« old
Act are unite bevond any municipal effort:
the purchase, price is based on profit-earn-
ing, and. estimated on recent performances,
up to five millions would be required.
The settlement of the whole matter is
urgent; the demand for gas is steadily over-
taking the capacity of the co.’s works, and
within seven years the outlay of an addi-
Honal fivp Tv,?Hi o ps nmnlm nnH pl^t

The accounts claim a net profit of £15.292
for the past 12 months; in the table the
amounts taken from reserves and from the
carry-forward of the previous year to pay
taxes and staff bonuses have been deducted.
Taking the directors’ figures, the year’s earn-
ings fell £458 short of 7 p.c. div. require-
ments, and the staff bonuses and income-tax
in respect of the period still had to be met.
This is very disappointing, particularly as
there are no goodwill shares for which divs.
have to be found, and as only a small pro-
portion of the co.’s funds is in real estate.
The financial squeeze in the early portion of
the year and the failure of some of the co. s
customers were blamed for the poor results.
In addition, the published figures indicate
that costs are troublesome. Here are the
figures for six years, “expenses” being in
respect of “administration, distribution, etc.” :
Gross Profit. Expenses.
1918 .. .. £97,422 £80,418
1919 .. .. 102,834 84,602
1920 .. .. 121,958 100,745
1921 .. .. 109,734 98,842
1922 .. .. 117,813 99,705
1923 .. 118,273 102,981
Bad-debt charges possibly affected the past
year’s figures; nevertheless, it is certain
that the management has met with difficulty
in its effort to reduce costs to correspond
with the smaller margin of gross profit. Most
of the co.’s turnover is in low-priced and
necessary commodities, and a business of
that nature feels the pinch of high costs
much more than others. Also there are
few lines for which it can charge the fancy
prices which certain other traders have*
little difficulty in collecting in this period of
personal extravagance.
The feature of Mitchell’s record since it
became a public co. has been that profits
have not expanded proportionately to the
rapid development of the business. Estab-
lished nearly 60 years ago, the public became
interested in 1913 on an invitation to put
in £lOO.OOO to finance the extension of manu-
facturing. The old proprietors' gave the
public a fair deal, because no consideration
whatever was asked for goodwill. About
24 years ago £77.814 more capital was
raised, and the total has been maintained
at £225 000 since that issue. The business
has grown so rapidly, however, that to carry
adequate stocks and larger customers’
accounts, at December 31 last liabilities
amounted to £191.5 7 3. Here are compari-
sons going back to 1917, when accounts were
first made public :
1917. 1920. 1922. 1923.
Capital .. £147,186 £225,000 £225,000 £225,000

Cash, etc. .. 6,026 8,770 11,165 11,509
Liabilities look uncomfortably large, but
whether they are actually so depends on the
volume of turnover, and how liquid are the
book debts for £292,290. The £191,573 of
liabilities may represent only a few weeks’
trading. On the figures at December 31 the co.
showed stocks, book debts and cash assets
for £396,996, equal to more than £2 for
every £1 owing to creditors. Extracting the
final div., no less than £196,423 of £225,000
paid capital was also covered by liquid
assets, and the balance of £28,577 w T as re-
presented by premises, plant and machinery
with a book value of £52,909. The surplus
assets were acquired by reserves accumu-
lated in earlier years. Since 1917 nothing
has been visibly laid aside; in fact, more
than £lOOO has dropped out of the account.
This contraction and the mildness of the
divs. throughout have been disappointing.
The period has, of course, been abnormal;
buying markets and exchanges have been
erratic, and high costs, heavier taxes and
fierce competition have affected trading.
Shareholders should reasonably expect the
management to show better results in more
settled times.

The co. experienced no severe set-back when
the prices of raw materials suddenly col-
lapsed or during the subsequent period of
depression in the softgoods trade. Pelaco
had the good fortune to have as chairman
E. C. Dyason, formerly of Bendigo, whose
knowledge of the world’s economic problems
enabled the co. to rapidly re-arrange its
affairs to the altered conditions. When the
slump set in, the directors promptly applied
the axe to stock prices, cleared all goods as
rapidly as the restricted market could absorb
them, and regulated production to con-
form to the new conditions. The direct
effect of this policy was a loss of £14,473
for the 1921 financial year, and that, was in-
creased to £21,055 when the reserves had
been drawn upon for the pref. divs. A good
recovery was made in the following year,
and for the past 12 months, by developing
new lines, a further improvement was shown,
despite an unfavorable market during the
autumn and winter months. Last year’s pro-
fits -were bettered on only two previous occa-
sions, and they were in the boom period.
Much more capital is now employed, though:
so the return on funds is not nearly so good
as formerly. However, sufficient was made
in each of the past two years to give ordi-
naries 10 p.c. and leave a few thousands for
reserves.
The following comparisons, going back to
the first accounts published after the recon-
struction in 1916, show the astonishing
expansion of the business in a half-dozen
years :
1917. 1920. 1922. 1923.

Cash, etc. . . 5,186 9,652 1,261 1,868
Capital has trebled since 1917; nevertheless,
the business has grown so big that liabilities
have expanded nearly nine times. A mort-
gage of £B5OO on factories is included in
the total in the table. Two : thirds of the
balance was overdraft, the Union Bank hav-
ing accommodated the co. to the extent of
£116,009 at December 31. Against £184,416
of floating debt were stocks, book debts and
other liquid assets with a book value of
£256,287. The co.'s position would be much
sounder if less dependence was placed on
creditors who might embarrass the manage-
ment if the business should experience a
set-back. Just at present the going is easy
—“the immediate outlook is quite satisfac-
tory,” the directors say. Pelaco has been
one of the bright spots in the recent develop-
ment of Australian manufacturing industry,
and it will probably become more Australian
when the Commonwealth’s new cotton-
growing and spinning industries get into
their stride.

The Metropolitan opened this century by
revaluing assets and writing £103,898 off
capital. Even then the old troubles were
not sufficiently straightened out to permit
divs. to be paid until 1908. This more or
less ancient history is dug up merely to
correct any misunderstanding which the
high rates of divs.—high, that is, for a build-
ing society—might convey. There are two
principal sources of profit: rents from estates
and interest on mortgages. Loans which aver-
aged £59,663 last year earned £4006; Glebe
leaseholds with a book value of £14,500
turned in £5713, and a Waterloo freehold
with a book value of £10,625 and £2OO of
leasehold in the same district produced
£1241. The book value of the Glebe lease-
hold, by the way, has been written down
from £34,500 to £14,500 in 10 years, but no
information is available as to how much
longer the lease has to run. Here are
balance-sheet comparisons over a long period:

Mortgage business is now larger than at any
time since the Metropolitan got into difficul-
ties in the ’nineties. For many years much
of the co.’s funds was locked up in non-
productive lands, and the loan business was
steadily developed as realisations were
effected. The recent expansion has been
helped by the employment of a little outside
money, but the management has proceeded
cautiously in that respect, and the only Ina-
bilities at December 31 were bank overdraft
£4137, sundry creditors £398 and £1144 of
unclaimed divs. But an amount only
a few hundreds short of the total

The many advantages offered b.y the use of Pioneer
Wood Pipe have brought it wide popularity during
the past 10 years. It is cheaper to buy, lighter to
handle, and simpler to instal than metal pipe. And
in service, its superiority is accentuated, for it does
not rust, corrode nor tuberculate, its flow does not
decrease with age, it is unaffected by electrolysis,
frost or “bad soil.” Write for our interesting book—
it gives much worth while, reliable information.

Cocky is being introduced to a new brand
of co-operation. The Farmers’ Wholesale
Supply Co., Ltd., was recently registered in
Melbourne with a nominal capital of a
quarter-million, but headquarters are in Syd-
ney. This concern proposes to reverse usual
co-operative procedure and fix prices to cus-
tomers to cover bare costs from the manu-
facturer, plus management, handling and
distributing expenses, and an incidental
which deserves particular mention. As the
co. will presumably be obliged to grant
credit to its farmer-customers, and will,
therefore, incur the risk of bad debts, the
proposal to distribute “profits” prior to
ascertaining whether they have been actually
earned is not sound. It is proposed to supply
only shareholders: for every 25 shares the
holder is entitled to purchase £lOO of goods
per annum, and if he exceeds liis quota an
extra 71 p.c. charge is to be levied until such
titne as the share interest has been increased.
The co. is offering 249,900 shares of £1
each, and the remaining 100 are to be issued
as fully-paid to the founders. They demand
control of the concern: the promoter is to
be' managing-director, the holders of the
founders’ shares are to have a representative
on the Board, and only one director is
to represent all the ordinaries taken
up. In addition, the Articles provide
that the holders of the 100 founders’ shares
shall have “as many votes as all the other
shareholders are for the time being entitled
to, provided that any fraction of a vote to
which a holder of founders’ shares may be en-
titled shall count as an additional vote.” So
the holders of 100 gift shares, who apparently
take no financial risk whatever, and, having
control on the Board, are under no obliga-
tion to manage the business economically,
demand the same voting strength as 249.900
cash-paid ordinaries —the same or more. But
this is not the limit of gifts to the founders:
it is also proposed that holders of the 100
shares shall receive “a cash bonus of 5 p.c.
p.a. on the total annual sales of the co.”
The proposals read more like material for a
Steele Rudd comedy than a business pro-
position.

Amalgamations at Kalgoorlie are again
being discussed in London. The most favored
are (1) Boulder, Ivanhoe and Horseshoe;
(2) Perseverance, South Kalgurli and Lake
View; and (3) Oroya Links and Associated.
However, at least two of the cos. are opposed
to amalgamations of any sort, so the chances
of any early fusion are not hopeful. There is
not the slightest doubt that if the grouping
could be effected, and central power and
treatment plants were established, costs could
be reduced and shareholders would do better.
Such an arrangement would also lengthen
the life of the mines, because cheaper costs
would bring considerable additional ore re-
serves with the range of profitable extraction.
Eventually, amalgamations will probably be
effected at Kalgoorlie in order to keep some
of the old has-beens at work a little longer,
but it will be too late then for shareholders
to benefit much.
Unless the unexpected happens, Gt. Boul-
der shareholders cannot hope for much. The
payable ore remaining in the old Kalgoorlie
mine is barely two years’ feed for the mill,
and on present appearances the chances of
opening up additional big tonnages are not
bright. The co.’s recent acquisitions at the
north end of the Hannan’s belt have some
ore in sight—about £20,000 worth —but the
reef is small, and assuming that the shoot
goes down tonnages will not be large. To
make matters worse, there is very little cash
in hand, accumulated profits having been
drawn upon to give shareholders larger divs.
than have been earned.
“Fine Gold”: The moribund condition of
Westralian mining is reflected by the opera-
tions of the Perth Stock Exchange. Hardly
anyone in the West knows of the existence
of this body or of its handful of members.
Meetings are held daily, but sales are rarely
recorded. Buying and selling quotations a
little below or above the latest Adelaide
figures are issued, and then, with a feeling
of work well done, the Exchange adjourns.
The Perth crowd’s most cherished right is
an affiliation with the Adelaide and Mel-
bourne Exchanges, and the sole reason for
its remaining flicker of life is the privilege
by which only Stock Exchange members can
rake in commission on Commonwealth loan
issues. There has been some talk of estab-
lishing a rival institution.
* * . * *
Westralian Mines Department, after
months of negotiation, has agreed to lend
Hampton Daisy £4OOO provided the co. gives
the Government a bill of sale and spends
another £lOOO. This means that the Govern-
ment will take precedence over the bank and
other creditors, to whom several thousands
are owing. The reef is small and the ground
hard, but values are considered good enough
by the Mines Department to warrant re-
opening the mine and giving it another
chance.

Prospecting for oil in the West has be-
come a farce. Outside Freney and Okes
areas, little or no work is being done; in-
stead. applications for exemption are con-
tinually being made and granted. The pleas
advanced for dodging labor conditions are
usually appeals for “time to raise capital
in London” or “to enable Dr. Clapp to in-
spect and report.” But as promoters
who have approached London have been told
to get oil first, and as Dr. Clapp’s examina-
tions will be confined to a few areas, these
excuses are mere bluff. By granting exemp-
tions indiscriminately the Government is
playing into the hands of shepherders, who
are holding only in the hope that either
Freney’s or Okes’ will strike oil and enable
them to sell at fancy prices.
Dr. Clapp, the U.S.A. oil expert, lias
stirred up mud in Victoria. Instead of visit-
ing the various alleged oil regions, he called
on geologist Baragwanath, of the Mines De-
partment, to yarn over geology plans. This
is mostly the Yankee way; Hoover did the
same thing, and before him Lindgren. Then,
having got a vision of the country rock, per-
sonal inspections followed. Clapp’s visualis-
ing, however, seems to have resulted in a
prompt decision that there is not much
country in Vic. that, could be classed as
likely oil ground. If he had said nothing
no one would have grumbled, but he rushed
into print with his opinion, and now his
popularity is on a par with that of geolo-
gist Baragwanath, whose failure to find
seepages and oozes and mysterious ozokerite
is the despair of the booster of Cabbage
Garden oil-plots. It would have been much
more polite of Clapp had he stopped long
enough to visit one or two localities, but
time is money with him. He is treating
S. Aus. on the same lines, although he knows
that if he doesn't find rills of petroleum at
Lake McDonnell George Meudell’s tommy-
hawk will have another dent in it, or if he
turns the Coorong down De Hautpick has a
new dictionary for fresh flights. Clapp’s
big job is to sum up possibilities on the
Locke areas (W.A.), Leo Jones’s reports
on that country having aroused his interest
in the Australian oil-hunt.
A protest from Melbourne: —
Dr. F. G. Clapp reached Melbourne by Sydney
express on the 4th instant, and his letter to the press
condemning the search for oil in Victoria was dated
the 7th. So that in three days, on imperfect evidence
tendered by officials, none of whom was a petroleum
technologist, this ex-official of the U.S.A. Geological
Survey advised the public that it was useless to
prospect for oil. How he could, as a scientific man,
reach such a damnatory conclusion wholly from perus-
ing geological maps which only detail 30 p.c. of
the surface of the State, and that only relating to the
big goldfields, seems incomprehensible. It was re-
ported that Dr. Clapp had been tempted to come to the
Commonwealth and examine and report on various
places where boring for oil is proceeding. His fee
was said to be £lO,OOO for a year’s engagement.
How this money was to be raised now looks simple.
The Mersey Valley Oil Co. was asked a £2OOO fee
for an examination of its properties near Latrobe
(Tas.). Next a Coorong co. about to begin boring
sent its chairman to see Dr. Clapp, who quoted
£lOOO as his fee for an examination. Both proposals
were turned down. It would not take many fat fees
like these to top £lO,OO0 —and leave a residue.
Lander shareholders can expect further
news of what is in the bore at Orallo (Q.)
earlier than was expected. The staff found
that sufficient 12in. casing was not available
in the Commonwealth, but instead of waiting
for supplies from California they have de-
cided to put down lOin. casing. If the job
is a success —the cementing of wells is not all
smooth going—Duncan Milsom should be
able to investigate his find in about a month.
Meanwhile Brisbane interest has subsided.
“Optimistic Alf” is on his way to London,
and Acting-Mines Minister Stopford is emu-
lating the oyster. Last week he announced
that the Government Geologist’s report had
not yet been received, and that he did not
know of any official oil analysis. Consider-
ing the enthusiasm with which the Lander
Co.’s report was thrown to the public by
the Minister, the Geologist is due for a little
“hurry up” with his report.
* * * *
Gympie (Q.) drew a blank as regards
crushings during January, but this month
No. 4 North Phoenix has cleaned up
3(530z. from 78 tons, and Buchanan and
party, working on the Great Southern, Ingle-
wood, crushed 16 tons of picked dirt which
will average about 20oz. per ton. The North
Smithfield has shut down.
Tin concentrates jumped from £lO6 to
£166 per ton between November and Janu-
ary, and the Herberton tin-miners (N.Q.)
are taking full advantage of the rise. Janu-
ary crushings were a bumper lot. The Wild
Irishman showed 151 tons of the best, worth
£2900, and the Arbouin crushed 340 tons
for £2520. Yu lean tributors won 9 tons
of concentrates worth £llBB from 230 tons.
The Bradlaugh weighed in with 13 tons
concentrates worth £2200 (from 37 tons
stone). Altogether, the Herberton tin re-
turns for January totalled £12,550, so the
old field is looking up once more.
Another good run by Ajax, Daylesford
(Vic.), is about ended, but the market is
not so foolish as to spec, scrip. Directors
have been running things pretty fine, for
after shelling out five divs. only £lO6 was
left. The crosscut east at No. 5 is a dud,
but the rise from No. 6 on the footwall splice
of stone is expected to give pay stuff instead
of the mixture at present showing in the
face. Lewis’s prospecting work has of late
not brought to light anything to gladden
the heart of the punters except slightly better
stuff south on the west side of the flat make.
It is not the Daylesford habit to give esti-
mates of reserves, but there is no evidence
of any reserve of pay-dirt proved at pre-
sent. Much, therefore, depends upon what
No. 6 brings forth. The show has been a
little wonder: its tally to date is gold,
£447,100; divs., £146,437 —all from £13,123
of calls.
Fred Tricks still sticks to Walhalla
(Vic.), though he is not being rewarded
for his pluck. At the Overseas he has had
the ground surfaced by R. J. Larsen, and
though a run of stone sft. wide was cut
it was not a winner. Now the old Long
Tunnel Extended tunnel is re-opened, and
the country is to be crosscut at depth, which
is about the most sensible step to take
around that old millionaire mine. Dick
Noble pushed a tunnel in 950 ft. west, so
half the work is done. The idea is to get
at the extension of the shoot for which
Hartrick has been searching for two years.
Billy Gundy, of Bendigo, is watching the
Overseas for Tricks’s party, so no opportuni-
ties will be missed.
New Red. White and Blue Consolidated,
Bendigo, won £24,780 of gold for the past
six months’ work. Only 13,469 tons went
to the battery, so things moved leisurely.
Three divs. of Is. each and new plant took
most of the profits. The good word regard-
ing New Blue is that the spurry formation
west at 1600 ft. is a perfect quarry of possi-
bilities.
* -X- -X- *
Hercules, Bendigo, had an improved yield
for the past fortnight: 275 tons gave 3170 z.
The 1520 ft.-level winze was rather dis-
appointing, 35 tons yielding only 330 z.; but
a substantial improvement showed up in the
1380 ft. stopes, whence 240 tons turned in
2S3oz.
* * * *
A six-weeks’ run of the Empire Tin Sluic-
ing, at Emmaville (N.S.W.), produced 5
tons lcwt. oxide, worth £l9O a ton. Work-
ing expenses ran into £5lO, leaving a profit
of about £4OO, equal to nearly 2d. per share.
“Cyanide”: The rush for shares in the
Mt. Tumblong float, near Tumut (N.S.W.),
provides an example of how, if you keep a
thing, it may prove useful. Portion of the
area at present receiving attention was
worked 20 years ago, but payable values
failed to materialise, and the lease was aban-
doned. However, the old owner did not
lose faith, and he is now getting a little of
his own back in the development co. which
has been formed on the strength of mining-
engineer A. P. Penman’s favorable opinion
of the formations.
The Ronpibon dredge is erected, and will
have its trial run this month. The co. has
a half-interest with the Miles crowd in the
Ronpibon Extended, for w 7 hich it provided
the land, and the reward is arriving in the
forpi of regular divs. The next job Ronpi-
bon has is to put a plant on Tom Horton’s
much-recommended Talern show. J. .S.
Henry has been over it with a yard-stick,
but he will do more measuring before the
capital for the dredge will be shaken out
of the crowd standing in with Palfreyman in
the show. By getting in £50,000 from an
issue of cum. prefs. sold at 20s. each, but
credited as paid up to £2 per share, the co.
satisfies its debenture debt and shakes free
of a 9 p.c. interest charge. The prefs. carry
5 p.c. and the right to share in any surplus
profits with the ordinaries. Before, this
deal was carried through, capital paid up
was £134,582, and the co. in June last owed
£5889 to sundry creditors. Mine stands in
at £24.480, and development at £28,762,
while the Talerm lease has a book value
of £10,578. The new 7 dredge has run away
with over £105,000. What a contrast to the
old days when a plant could be got for
£50,000 or £60,000!

“Kopai”: Upper Murray folk must have
smiled over the startling descriptions of their
hills and downs sent to Melbourne and Syd-
ney papers by city-bred "special writers”
detailed to provide hot copy over the Batson
man-hunt. Batson in his days of wandering
never went mucli beyond rifle-range of Jin-
gellic township (which practically embraces
Redbank township, the Victorian settlement
over the bridge), but the special writers
spread themselves vividly on the beetling
crags, the impregnable ranges and the lonely

homes further out. The back-country behind
Tingellic township is certainly no billiard-
table. It is billy country which forms the
hinterland of the big. rough, straggly squat-
tages of Copabella, Manus, .Tingellic and
Ournie; but every foot of it was galloped
over 40 years ago, when it was rough going.
For miles at and near .Tingellic, Lankey’s
Creek and Walwa (Vic.) the country is-open,
rolling downs, lightly timbered with “left”
trees, save for a few rough scarps not worth
clearing. There is a mail-route every few
miles, and the popular means of locomotion
is the motor-car. It. is long-settled country,
populated considerably by stay-tlieres, who
run to the third and fourth generations. In
the old days the station back-paddock:, had
the reputation of being happy hunting-
grounds for the Australian equivalent ot
“clear-skins.” As in all old, remote settle-
ments where intermarrying is frequent,, to
find one of a family who is a "bit queer is
not uncommon. Yet the settlers would
resent nothing more than the idea that they
were in the \Yoop Woops. They are even
expecting a railway—have been expecting it
for 30 years.
“Ex-Dig.”: It is cabled that in Russia
'“women of birth and breeding are con-
stantly appealing to foreigners to many
them "without obligations of any kind' in
order to enable them to secure passports
to leave the country. Something ot the sort
was not unknown even in England at the
end of the war, and some extraordinary otters
were made to Diggers by women who looked
upon the Commonwealth as the 1 ronused
Land, where, if they got in early, they might
annex one of the surplus men so frequently
mentioned by London journals; and the same
papers also stressed the concessions in regard
to fares for wives and feminine relatives ot
Australian soldiers. I myself had to decline
the offer of a lady who wanted to be a sister
to me for the voyage only; and, although
the Transportation Section weeded out a lot
of bogus relatives, some must have got
through. A case that obtained some pub-
licity was that of Private Muggs, who, hav-
ing taken unto himself a Pommy bride,
weighed in with an application for passages
for her father and mother, three sisters, an
aunt and his helpmate’s two daughters by a
previous marriage. When the application was
turned down the brand-new Mrs. Muggs de-
clined to go any further with her newly-
acquired husband, and spoke with indignation
of officialdom’s breach of a sacred contract.
“Uramao”: The Macs in Maoriland are
boiling over at the indignity placed upon
their language by the P.O. regulations. One
Scot in the North and another in the South
island presented telegrams of greeting to dis-
tant Burns societies on the anniversary ot
the poet’s birth, and had their messages
handed back with the intimation that,
“being in no known language,’ they
could' not be transmitted. The north-
ern Scot was especially wroth at
his attempt to get through
a line from “Tam o’ Shun-
ter.” “May ye be planted

“H.K.”: The Provincial
Synod of the Church of
England has adopted Janu-
ary 27 as the date of the
first religious service held
in Australia; nevertheless a
doubt exists as to whether
the Word was first preached
that day or a week later.
Collins states that Phillip
arrived in Port Jackson
and anchored off the mouth
of the Cove on the eve of
the 25th. Coming to the
20th. Lieut. Kingworth
wrote that “the next day at
daylight the English colors
were displayed on the shore
and possession was taken
for his Majesty.” Tench,
after referring to the land-
ing of a party of marines
and convicts on the 27th,
goes on to say: “On the
Sunday after our landing
Divine Service was per-
formed under a great tree
by the Rev. Richard John-
son in the presence of the
troops and convicts, whose
behavior on the -occasion
was equally regular.” P»y
some, including no less an
authority on the Colony’s
early history than James 11.
Watson, it has been held
that the date indicated is
February 3. The conten-
tion is that so muchwork had to be done in
the direction of clearing away the bush,
immediately on the prisoners and their guards
being landed, that public worship was de-
ferred until the following Sunday.

“Flicker” : In view of Lord Leverhulme s
holding-up of America as a shining example
of what the colored races can do in parts
where the white man cannot exist, the fol-
lowing statements taken from the “Statisti-
cal Bulletin of the Metropolitan Life In-
surance C 0.,”, one of America’s greatest
societies, is rather striking. The article
is in the May (19231: edition, and is
entitled “Mortality from heat and sun-
stroke.” It points out that deaths from these

“Jim, whatever is the baby crying for?
“Listen to him—you can hear what he’s saying as well as I can!”
causes are more numerous in the cities in pro-
portion to population than in the country, and
in the temperate zone than in the south ; also
“colored persons have a higher death-rate
[from sunstroke} than whites, and this can-
not be ascribed to the fact that colored per-
sons are relatively more numerous m the
South. Experience has shown that even
in the Southern States the heat prostration
death-rate of colored persons exceeds that
for whites.” Follows a paragraph winch
touches directly on Leverhulme’s most fre-
quent statement: —
The fact is that the highest death-rates from heat
prostration are not found, as might be supposed, in
the Southern States. North and South Carolina,
for example, show, year after year, very low deatn-
rates from this cause, and the figures for Kentucky,
Tennessee and Virginia are well below the aieiage
for the registration area. The States which show
the most above-average rates are Michigan W lscon-
sin Indiana and Ohio, in the east north-cential
region, all of the middle Atlantic States, and Mis-
souri in the west north-central section.
Incidentally, the mortality from sunstroke is
“much higher in cities than in the agricul-
tural districts”; also in cities many people,
though they do not die from heat prostra-
tion, are “permanently impaired in health
through it.”
“Trevdee”: How’s this for cobbership?
Two Melbourne boys were born in the same
suburb, went together to the same State
school, passed on to the same college, and
worked later in the same city warehouse.
When the war came, although they enlisted
independently, they found themselves not
only in the same training-camp but in the
same company. They sailed in the same
boat, were together most of the time on the
other side, and came home within a montn
or two of each other. Like many good sol
diers they were out of work for a time,
looked for a job together, and landed new
ones simultaneously. It was surely a lifting
climax to all this that they should tall in
love at the same time and in much the same
place; and a double wedding took place the
other day, when the two cobbers were mar-
ried to two sisters.

Curlewis, as an expert in “the habits of

to express both letter and figure. ’Sonors
outburst suggests a certain official attitude
towards the typiste and all her works. It
may not matter much, perhaps, in com-
merce and other not necessarily lettered
callings if the lady is ‘‘a bit off” in her
spelling; but to the official mind such hap-
penings are sins. Years ago when the sten-
ographer was pressing his way into the con-
servative public service, Critchett Walker,
Principal Under-Secretary, tried one in his
own sacred room. One day he presented
himself before .the then newly-established
\ Public Service Board and addressed the
... members. “Yon sent the a young man some
weeks ago. I’ll never sleep a wink while
lie is there. I dictated to him a most im-
portant memorandum to the Agent-General.
I said. ‘The effect of the present mining

out of the colony. The new regulations re-
cognise that every effort should be made to
reassure the capitalist. He is our best
friend.’ And this is what your precious
man dished up to me: ‘The effect of the
present mining regulations has been to drive
the caterpillar out of the colony. The new
regulations recognise that every effort should
be made to reassure the caterpillar. He is
our best friend.’ For God's sake take him
away and send me a long-hand man !

“Mrs. Cooper alleged that her husband had an
intrigue with the office cleaner, Mrs. Goodman, with
whom he had remained at the works on Saturday
afternoons. His employer was amazed to discover
that Cooper had charged for 70 hours’ overtime for
Saturdays during a slack period.” —Divorce report.

Enchantment to the evening calm,
When to the sea a pathway bends
Where, wandering, we can gather balm,
You know not the divinest thrill
That makes the passing hours sublime —
To-morrow 1 will take my quill
And charge them up as overtime !
Your lips allure; but, ah, the thought—
Each kiss they give is cash to me!
So, by the moving pictures taught,
I make them long-drawn ecstasy.
A dozen well-judged raptures may
Earn me more money than a rhyme—
Oh, precious lips, remain, 1 pray,

“Nitric”: A colony of Russian refugees,
5!) in number, has settled at Thornlands, in
the fruit-farming district of Cleveland (Q.).
General Tolstoff is the recognised leader.
There are also a colonel and two captains,
products of the military academy at Lenin-
grad, two doctors and a barrister; many of
the younger men of the colony were engi-
neering students doing their University
course in 1917, when the revolution broke
out. The womenfolk are also all well edu-
cated. General Tolstoff was fighting on the
German front up to the time of Russia’s
final collapse. His choice then lay between
throwing in his lot with the Bolsheviks
and escaping to his home on the Caspian.
He chose the latter, and later sailed with
the other refugees to Australia. A com-
patriot, who is a successful farmer in the
Cleveland district, induced them to take
up land there.
Blood-curdling story from Adelaide: —
The flood of accounts ill the dailies of irresponsible
persons running amok with lethal weapons nearly
got Bloggs into serious trouble. Bloggs, who is
a trifle absent-minded, keeps in his office a Malay
kris for use as a paper-knife. He had just finished
slicing open some letters when he discovered it
was lunch-time. Grabbing his hat, he abstractedly
placed the dagger in his breast pocket, instead of
the letters. He then caught a tram for home.
Presently he became aware that he was carrying
something extra heavy, felt for it, and hauled it out.
His look of blank astonishment was interpreted by
fellow passengers as a maniacal glare, and there was
a prompt exodus from his vicinity. The conductor,
apprised of the matter, grabbed a large spanner and
came to investigate. By good luck he had some

acquaintance with Bloggs, and waited for explana-
tions before hitting. Still the rest of the journey
was not pleasant, and even yet many typists nearly
swallow their chewing-gum if Bloggs sits near them
on the luncheon tram.
“Percy Pawnticket” : When any person
dies in hospital, and there are no relatives to
claim his effects—and pay for his funeral —
the hospital is entitled to all he has in his
pockets. Not many months ago there died
in Prince. Alfred, Sydney, one Michael Burke,
a queer old chap who was once a postmaster

in Sydney and up-country. He had lived,
after liis retirement, as if lie were in extreme
poverty, but he left £411,000 behind him.
The institution thought that, in default of
wills or relatives, it had a title to a sum of
money that would have done it a lot of good,
and put in a claim to the estate. The
N.S.W. Public Trustee has decided, however,
that only what was actually in the dead
man’s pockets can go to the hospital. For
the rest, the Burkes of the world being numer-
ous and the wealth waiting to be annexed
well-advertised, some six or seven hundred
claimants, mostly from Ireland, arc already
in communication with the Public Trustee.
“P.P.”: Sydney owns a water-front citi-
zen—in Sweden he held his master’s certi-
ficate, but he prefers to be a plain A.B. and
live in Sydney—who knows what a big
heart the late Governor Davidson had. He
came to Sydney for the first time as mate of
a timber-carrier, and, the day being a swel-
tering one, he decided on a dip in the harbor.
Most of the crew followed his example, and
they were thoroughly enjoying themselves
just before the
water police came
along and collected
names. When the
case came into
court the Swedish
mate was fined £5 ;
and knowing no-
thing of the laws
of the country he
went along to put
his case before the
Governor and ex-
plain that he was
only a poor man to
whom a fiver was
a vast sum. His
Ex. could not inter-
fere, of course;
but the day before
the time fixed for
the payment of the
fine he sent along
a cheque which
covered the
amount. In view
of the late Gov-
ernor’s _ circum-
stances, since ex-
posed, it was a
very generous act; and the man who re-
ceived the timely help has never forgotten it.

“Burglar’s Laborer" : Australian represen-
tation at the British Empire Exhibition will
not be confined to city plutocrats and shep-
herd kings. At the special request of Scot-
land Yard, which has a wholesome respect
for Australian crooks, the Australian police
forces are keeping a close watch on such
criminals as have an international reputa-
tion, and sheaves of details have gone across
to enable the Tommy ’tecs to identify unae-
sirables of note from the Commonwealth.
Sometimes the local police know exactly the
boats their men have gone by ; but in a few
cases they are sending the information on
general principles because the people con-
cerned have disappeared. Some of these
gentry travel in style; one top-notch prac-
titioner, who is taking a party of female
relatives with him, is said to have disbursed
£2000 for fares and outfit, but lie doubtless
regards the expenditure as an investment,
not a holiday extravagance. One of the big
mailboats recently brought back sensational
accounts of a big swindle that was worked
over the card-table on the last voyage Eng-
landwards. It gives the idea that at least
one magsman got in early.
“McNorth”: It’s no good, you can’t dodge
the domestic-help problem. A little lady,
the wife of a planter-friend in Papua,
thought she had solved it, only to find that
every country grows a cx*op of troubles of
its own for the housewife. In this case the
lady had a girl whom she industriously
trained from a crude village maiden into a
capable domestic. One day the girl dis-
closed that she had a lover who was saving up
to purchase her from her father. The missus,
apprehensive of losing the treasure, lectured
her upon the trials and tribulations of mar-
riage, enlarged upon the quality of the food
and housing she was enjoying in her present
employment, and, as a further means of
inducing her to stay, increased her wages.
It was the last that was the fatal error. The
girl left to be married soon afterwards. She
explained that she had given, her “rise” to
her lover, and thus enabled him to complete
her purchase earlier than would otherwise
have been possible.
* * * *
“Te Pana”: The Raratongan contingents
recruited by Maoriland for the war mostly
came from remote coral dumps in the East-
ern Pacific. Few of the boys had ever
worn boots, and there was great excitement
when, arrived at Narrow Neck M.C., Auck-
land, they were fitted with shoe-leather.
Sizes 12 to 17 were in most demand, and
most of these “Bill Masseys” had to be
specially made. While the foot-coverings
were being broken in, the boys were spelled
every 20 minutes during training operations,
and to gain relief from cramped toes they
would crawl about the parade-ground like
snakes. I had a squad of Raras on Rangi-
toto Island searching for Yon Luckner when
he made his break from internment. They
discarded their boots early in the piece, and
for three days travelled over rough scoria
without even showing a cut. They had the
finest half-inch of natural leather-sole ever
tanned.
From a woman who has been writing to
The Bulletin from the Northern Territory
for nearly 20 years, and who has never once
written as though she was tired: —
Lord Leverhulme, who has never seen the N.T.,
has been loudly expressing his conviction that it is
no place for white wives. Well, the late Mrs. Tuck-
well lived 52 years in the Territory; and Mrs. V.
V. Brown, her daughter, who was born here over
50 years ago, is now a hale and hearty grandmother.
I could mention many others, among them old
Mrs. Mansfield and Mrs. Allwright, mothers both of
strong, healthy families, and working-men’s wives
at that, for whom southern trips are few and far-
between. Vital statistics show that the N.T. has the
lowest female death-rate and the highest birth-rate
of any part of Australia; As a woman who has lived
nearly a score of years in the N.T., and has a
healthy family of small Australians growing up
around her, I pit my opinion on the subject against
any globe-trotting soap lord’s. I shall be more than
satisfied to spend the next 40 years in the N.T. if
only I enjoy the same health and happiness that I
have been blessed with in the past.

WM. BROOKS,
M.L.C., master
printer and muni-
cipal reformer
of Sydney.
Complying with a wish expressed by 100
of his solid supporters, Vic. ex-Treasurer
McPherson has decided to continue as mem-
ber for Haw-llawthorn in the Leg. Assembly
if he can secure election while he is away
in the Cold Land. R. ,J. Alcock, former part-
ner and business successor of the late James
Service (head of the Great Coalition), George
Swinburne, ex-Minister for Water Supply,
and Everard, M.L.A. for Evelyn, were among
McPherson’s standard-bearers. A valedictory
feast for the iron-and-bolt knight is to be
spread at Menzies’ on March 4.
No eligible seems to covet the Vic. Agent-
Generalship, which will be vacated by
McWhae in July. McPherson, Mackinnon,
Merritt and Mcßeath are said to have all
cold shouldered the job. Barnes and Pen-
nington, two ex-Ministers, who are only re-
garded as sub-eligibles, will be in London
when McWhae quits, but they are not keen
either, as the “allowance” paid is only £1750
a year. McWhae, who is wealthy, has
queered the pitch for a successor with a
slender purse. George Fairbairn, just mar-
ried for the second time, can have the job if
he wants it. He could keep up the social
end as w T cll as McWhae, and, besides, has
ability.
Lord Armstrong, alleged to be the mysteri-
ous peer whose insurances for £320,000 were
auctioned for a little over £lOO,OOO the other
day, once thought he had a half-share in
an Australian squattage. He met .Colonel
Murray, a splendid-looking specimen of
manhood, who made his appearance at sundry
tony British resorts, pushed his way into
the best social circles, and organised Victory
Balls, which dragged in good money for
patriotic funds. Murray’s talk of his Aus-
tralian estates interested the peer, who felt
grateful when the A.I.F. man, as a matter
of friendship, agreed to let him have a half-
share in one of his stations. A small sum
was paid, and Murray was arrested shortly
afterwards as an a.w.l. private. The lord
is the great-nephew of the founder of the
Armstrong-Whitworth firm, and was a direc-
tor until his unfinancial habits caused him
to be pushed out 15 years ago.
An Australian’s name in the last New
lear Honors list overlooked by the cables
was that of Reg A. Mant, C. 5.1., who was
handed a knighthood for services in the
Indian Civil Service. He is the son of one
°f Bananaland’s cattle pioneers; was
schooled at the Maryborough Grammar; won
the Queensland exhibition, and went to
Oxford. He has been in the I.C.S. for over
a score of years, got the C.S.I. a while back,
and in 1922 was an unofficial member of the
hiscal Commission in India under Lord
Inchcape.
Engineer Capt. Sydenliam, R.N.. Austra-
lia’s senior naval engineer, is more interested
than most people in the forthcoming arrival
of the warship Hood. When the big battle-
ship’s keel was about to be laid down at
Clydebank, he was detailed to supervise her
construction on behalf of the Admiralty.
She was two and a half years building, and
he was on the spot all the time. When she
was launched he \vas appointed senior engi-
neer officer in charge of her, a position
which lie held for another two and a half
years. When he was offered his present job,
his acceptance was possibly influenced by
tile fact that his wife is a Maoriland girl.
“Warihi”: Peter Grant, who died at Te
Puke (M.L.) the other day at 84, claimed
to have ridden in the first Melbourne Cup
race. He had been many thing? in his time,
and, having got a job as poundkeeper at Te
I’uke, he had only rounded up his first batch
of straying cattle the day St. Peter called.
Grant’s feats as a member of the old Armed
Constabulary had spread a glamor over the
veteran’s life. In the land-grabbing expedi-
tion the Bay of Plenty Maoris, he
was a" despatch-carrier, and on one occasion
is alleged to have swum across Tauranga
Harbor. When the Duke of Edinburgh de-
cided to see Rotorua, Grant was one of the
men in the escort organised by the late
Captain Gilbert Mair to see that no one ate
the ducal visitor.
“R-ienzi” finds a policeman:—
Mafe\.S. v. Dudley, tiie new Commissioner of
Police in the N.T., has worn the bobby’s uniform
in some remote corners of the Empire. He had his
first big beat as a mounted man in Rhodesia, but
after seven years of it, joined the Canadian North-
West Mounted. Moonshiners were his trouble in the
Nor’-West, and he never went to bed without an
arsenal under his pillow. The'Big War rather bored
him, and as soon as the row finished he tried hard
to turn his hair white in the Royal Irish Constabu-
lary. Coming to Melbourne he was one of the first
of the horsed specials in the police mutiny last year,
but it was too much of a sofa existence for this
lover of the outside places. If he hadn’t caught the
N.T. post he would probably have tried his luck
in Burma, where the ancient .pastime of dacoity
calls for a quick eye and hand. The gifted and
witty H. H. Munro (“Saki”), who was killed in
France in 1916, had a taste of excitement in the
Burmese Mounted Police.
“G.R.”: All this talk about overloaded
ships and unseaworthy ships leaving Sydney
reminds me that one Samuel Plimsoli was
born 100 years ago on February 10. His
centenary passed almost unnoticed in Aus-
tralia. Yet there are few with better claims
on sailor-men’s remembrance, and none has
a finer monument.
A pending retirement is that of Justice
Higgins who, although the law doesn't men-
tion a retiring age for High Court Judges,
feels at 73 that it is nearly time he
called it a day. Like his colleague Isaacs,
J., he helped to frame the Constitution. If
the Deputy-President of the Federal Arbi-
tration Court (Dr. Quick) isn’t counted in,
they are the only two Judges left who sat in
the Convention. The late J. 11. Gordon, of
South Aus., was the last on a State Bench.
Edward James Burgess, of Hobart, who
passed out a few days ago at 74, spent much
of his life in surveying Speck railways and
Ma State townships, but in 1885 he and his
brother (since dead) established the now
prosperous business of Burgess Bros., wine
merchants, etc. He was a member of the
Hobart Marine Board, and helped to admin-
ister that side of the city’s affairs for
over 14 years. Barrister E. Roy Burgess,
of Melbourne, is his only son.
Alfred Ross, one of the best-known fruit-
growers on the Murray, who was recently
found dead at Waikerie (S.A.) beside a
gun which had apparently exploded while
he was getting through a fence, was the
only son of R. D. Ross, a long-ago Speaker
of S.A. Assembly. He sold his holdings at
Waikerie two years ago, and became one of
the heads of the Dried Fruits Association,
which is doing a lot to find markets for the
Murray output. His wife, who died not
long ago, was a sister of General George
Dean. Ross was a born fighter, and the
story goes that when North cliff c’s secretary
tried to keep him from getting an audience
in the interests of the D.F.A.. lie pursued
the great man into his bathroom.
“R.F.K.F.”: Died the other day at Mud-
gee (N.S.W.), one Schlacliter, said to be
the pioneer velocipede builder of Australia
—he made his first machine in 186 S. The
main points in the bike’s evolution since
then are cranks and pedals, ball bearings,
hollow-tubed frames and rubber tyres. Crank
machines were patented in 1868, just two
years before Schlacliter turned out his first
Australian velocipede, though it took nearly
20 to get them properly on the market,
fecluachter s Australian velocipede appeared
well ahead of the real birth of the cycle
trade, which started at Coventry in 1873.
“T. 0.1.”: Obit, Herbert Edward Lord, last
survivor of the sons of George William
reasurer in thc Martin Ministry of
1870-72. George became M.L.A. in 1856 and
sat in the first eight Parliaments; he fin-
ished in the Leg. Council and died in 1880.
Simeon Lord, the grandfather, was a very
early merchant trader; in 1805 he .built a
fine house, and adjoining stores, in Mac-
quarie-place, where the Bank of New South
Wales is just now erecting its lofty pre-
mises. Simeon had other sons, Edward, who
was City Treasurer for years, and Francis,
who was a member of the first Parliament
(1843), and lived to be 92. Herbert Lord’s
remains went to the old family vault at
St. Matthew’s, Botany, where grandfather
Simeon had a woollen-mill a century ago.
George Black, N. S. Wales M.L.C., was
70 on the 15th of the month. Black was a
member of the
original Labor
party (lie left a
sub-editor’s chair
in The Bulletin
office to contest a
seat), and had a
hand in drafting
the first Labor
platform—was, in
fact, the actual
draftsman. Lie
wrote “The His-
tory of the Labor
Movement,” which
covers . its early
days, and is a very
valuable record,
but is now 20 years
out of date.
F. W. EGGLES-
TON, the ncicly-
appointed Min-
ister for Water
Supply and
Assistant-Trea-
surer in Victoria
— Lawson’s latest
sop to Cerberus.
Joe Carrutliers claims to have been the
first N. S. Wales Premier to have locomo-
tives built in the State, and he was, although
he has to share the credit with others. Early
in Carruthers’s Premiership the necessity for
ordering locomotives arose, but the N.S.W.
tenders were £ll per ton higher than those
of foreign competitors. Dave Sullivan,
then secretary of the Moulders’ Union, got
to work and gave the employers an assur-
ance that the men would do their best to
help them if the tenderers would reduce their
estimates. Combined deputations and other
influences were brought to bear on the Gov-
ernment, the prevalence of unemployment be-
ing particularly stressed. Carrutliers finally
promised to give a moderate preference to
local tenders, and n.ew otters were invited,
the local tenderers this time making reduced
quotations and winning.
Harold Bullock, just dead in Adelaide at
47, was the eldest son of that city’s best-
known land agent. His father, an ex-mayor,
had a big business for the son to step into;
but the latter saw early the future of elec-
tricity, equipped himself with an English
training, and when the Adelaide trams were
electrified in 1909 was ready to take a big
part with the Tramways Trust. For some
years before his death he was in charge of
the power station; but most of the last
twelvemonth saw him laid aside by illness.
“Emerald”; Of course, Ramsay Macdonald
will save the Empire by appearing in a silk
hat. Ten years ago he always wore a top-
hat and frock-coat, or looked as if he did.
I remember a meeting where he spoke about
the danger from the “young middle-class
woman in revolt.” He was hitting at the
Ann Veronicas of that period. To this Dr.
Marion Phillips, also on the platform,
promptly answered that worse danger might
be feared from the “middle-aged man who
was contented.” This was a staggerer for
Ramsay the Radical. Dr. M'arion Phillips,
by the way, was a graduate of Melbourne,
and achieved her economics doctorate in
London.
Passed through Sydney recently on his
way home to Dunedin (M.L.), Bishop James
Whyte, one time professor at Manly
(N.S.W.) and chancellor of Sydney R.C.
Archdiocese. There are now left only three
of the original professorial staff appointed
by Cardinal Moran when the college at Manly
was started. Of these Monsignor Hayden,
half-brother of the Bishop of Forbes-Wil-
cannia, and himself left at the episcopal
barrier on several occasions, still remains as
president of the college; while Monsignor
McDermott, the late president, salvages the
souls of Leichhardt (N.S.W.) parish. Bishop
Whyte went to Dunedin to succeed his ori-
ginal boss in the college—Dr. Verdon, cousin
of Cardinal Moran.
The business of the Coort at Ryde (Syd-
ney) was shifted into a new building the
other day, and an interested spectator of the
transfer was ex-Sergeant John Ross. The
old hall of justice was built 61 years ago,
and it was this ancient John Hop who was
put in charge of it. He still lives in the
district, and is hale enough to look forward
to his centenary.
ROCKS AHEAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
On all, no doubt, regrets encroach,
And while, instead of sleep,
Dim phantasies of self-reproach
About their bedside creep,
They grieve for things they said of yore;
But when the east grows grey
1 find 1 always most deplore
The things 1 didn’t say.
The bitter, calculated sneers
1 all too meekly heard,
The slights and taunts and subtle fleers
I took without a word,
The cats who; snubbed me when we met
And seathless got away—
Oh, how intensely I regret
The things I didn’t say.
O great Bellona, from my knees
To you this prayer is flung:
More cayenne in my temper, please,
More venom in my tongue,
And give my arrows swallow’s wings,
So that another day
’Tis others shall regret the things
I’ll take good care to say!
VICTORIA.

BOORI: “By cripe, here come poor old Yarrum. Old, old, old

B USHMAN: “He’s the oldest blackfellow here. Was he lorn on
this river?”
BOORI: “No fear, loss. Old Yarrum here long-fella time ’fore
river.”
“Luxoui”: Recent references to crack
shots remind ine of young Lucius Conolly, a ver-
satile sportsman, whose name has more than once
appeared between the red covers of The Bulletin.
In pre-war days, when the old Poonambil homestead
housed the Conolly clan and Selby Stewart was book-
keeping there, every minute of the two young men's
spare time was given over to practice with arms
Of various calibre, but mostly with the Winchester
.22 rifle. With this latter they became amazingly
proficient. I have seen them single out and clip
the topmost dead twigs from a tall gum while the
tree was swaying in the wind. They could shoot
straight from a galloping horse or from a moving
car. But what left me stone cold and gasping was
when they took me down to the billabong one even-
ing just at dusk when the bats were coming out, and
Shot six of the tiny, darting creatures on the wing.
They fired 10 shots between them, and got three
bats each.
* * * *
“Tee Dee”: One of the thriftiest men I
ever met was a very well-known Marlborough (M.L.)
squatter, who left a six-figure fortune. In the days
before motor-cars brought the towns to our doors, my
friend used to drive a reliable old prad, attached to
the original two-horse shay in which Mr. Noah
whirled the missus and kids to church. On arrival
in Blenheim the old chap always drove to a vacant
section, tied the horse to a fence, and fixed the nose-
bag’. Then he produced from a box in the trap
a venerable rooster, whose duty it was to pick up
what Neddy dropped from the bag. As it was the
chook’s sole chance of a feed, nary an oat went
astray.
* * * »
“Pick”: If the Council is holding a parade
of long-distance walking-cranks, let me into the
ring with my -exhibit—Harry Ford, at or.e time
employed in a bank at Bega (N.S.YV.). As after-
tea exercise Ford often strolled around to Tathra
or Merimbula on the 12-miles-distant coast, varying
that constitutional by a flit through the ravines of
Mt. Mumbla, 15 miles away. Once being asked to
referee a football match at Cobargo between two
teams that couldn’t agree about their umpire, Ford
disdained the proffered conveys"•'•e a * if'o-
off time at the bank did the 25-mile journey on
foot. He followed a wild and woolly dust-up be-
twixt the rival hooters to the end, a..d tne.,, ueeiin-
ing to wait for the banquet, returned on foot to
Bega by a circuitous course through Tanja that
added another 20 miles to the afternoon’s trip. He
loved only one thing better than a long walk, and
that was a long run, in which the pace wasn’t too
speedy, but a jig-jog which he kept up for 10 or
15 miles and back.
* * # *
“Nitric”: The 10 minutes cited by “Con-
damine” (B. 31/l/’24) is no record for a goanna to
stay below water. I have seen one disappear for
half an hour, and have watched him under the
water. Goannas, like water-snakes, are specially-
constructed for this submarining work. The nostrils
are placed right at the top of the snout, as in croco-
diles, so they- are also able to trick the observer by
submerging and coming up with just the tip of the
head out and the remainder of the body quite im-
mersed. The nostrils are small and subcrescentic,
and are provided with a valve interiorly, which is
opened during respiration and closed when the ani-
mal dives. The lungs are also very capacious
and extend back in some eases almost to the base of
the tail. (This is also the case with water-snakes.)
By filling these huge air sacs they are able to float
without effort, and to remain under the water for
a considerable time. All the Australian species are
arboreal, though the well-known water-lizard, which
never assumes the large proportions of the goanna,
is mostly 7 aquatic. A species of marine lizard, Oreo-
ceplialus cristatus , occurs in the Galapagos Islands,
and they are seldom seen more than 20yds. inland.'
Their feet are webbed, and a flattened tail aids
locomotion. They have been timed to remain 45
minutes under water.
* * *
“Fo Moe Quie”: The Chinese here (Billi-
ton, Dutch East Indies), ii any of the family is verv
ill, seek the aid of a god whom they call the tup-i-
-kong, and tne way they go about it is reminiscent
of the tire-walkers of
the .South Seas. Hav-
ing collected all their
flriends they set tire to
about 10 tons of wood,
and when this has been
reduced to red-hot
coals they spread them
6in. deep over an
area about 15ft. long
and 3ft. wide. Then
the family and friends
march over this red-
hot bed hve or six
times. It does not
affect their feet at all.
I have seen it done by
a Chinese under-boss
of mine with about 50
Celestial friends. When
I asked him how it
was done, he could
only tell me that the
tup-i-kong arranged it
to cure the sick one
and drive thh Evil One
away. I have been
here seven years and
know the Chinese ways
pretty well, but this
has me beat. What is
the secret of the im-
munity of these fire-
walkers ?
fied to? ; l° f W ? iat , the Council has testi-

that a s,X £*T l , no teeth ). let me announce
that a simple cure—l have often seen it prove effi
cacious for both the pain and the evil after-effects
ot a centipede sting-is a vigorous rubbing of the
injured part with salt water. And vou needn’t be
beside the sea, because a fistful of salt may be
obtained inland, and water is cheap. There are
worse antidotes, than salt water for snakebite.

“Paul Cupid”: The most adventurous
lover that I have met lives at Moree (N.S.W.),
in the shed containing linesmen’s material in the
post-office yard. When darkness came, though the
street was alive with curs, this Romeo would spring
from the fence on to a telephone pole, and begin his
Blondin act alofg the cable containing a number of

SWEET CHILD (direct from Potts Point) : “Do you think one of
the gentlemen would stop shearing and twim liddle Wupert’s

telephone wires suspended between the poles, stroll-
ing along for about 300yds. till opposite the Moree
Club. Watching his opportunity he would shin
down, scuttle across the street and into the Club
premises. Here some ’possums have remained un-
molested in fact, protected—for a long time. After,
no doubt, a hilarious night, Romeo would go back
the way he came before the prying dawn grew bold.
The cable that bridged the gap between this ’possum
and his Juliet has now been placed underground,
and how he still carries on his courtship I don’t
know; but as “love laughs at locksmiths,” no doubi:
he laughs also at linesmen. Anyhow, he is still, or
was a few weeks ago, hale and hearty.
* * *
“Coot” : Re the damper argument. Know
the origin of the word? Dr. Lang, in “Cooksland”
(1847), says the name was alleged “to have somehow
originated with Dampier, the celebrated navigator.”
But that isn’t very conclusive.
* * * *
“Morob”: Along parts of the north-west-
ern coast of New Guinea, and especially around
Hollandia Bay in the Dutch Territory,
there is a superstition among native
women to the effect that if they eat
earth prior to the birth of a child
the latter will be of the light brown
color so admired in those regions. It
is difficult to account for the origin
of the custom, and it cannot be con-
nected in any way with the earth-
eating of ankylostomiasis, since this
disease has been known only in recent
years on that part of the coast, and
the practice has prevailed from time
immemorial. There really may be
something in the custom. The sug-
gestion has been put forth on excellent
authority that the variation in color
so often seen among the native com-
munities of the Pacific is due not to
ethnological factors but to geological
environment, people with lighter skins
being found in the districts in which
lime is more abundant in the earth,
while the natives with coal-black
hides, like those of Buka, in the
Solomons, live in country where there
is little or none. If there is any con-
nection between this theory and the
earth-eating mentioned, it is but an-
other instance of the puzzling know-
ledge possessed by natives of what we
regard as scientific facts.
“Jarrah”: “Hayband” (B. 17/l/’24)
mentions a N.S.W. man finding seven ounces of
clover and trefoil seed in and around one ants’ nest.
Near Bridgetown (W.A.), after sowing crimson and
white Dutch clover seed evenly in a field, I was
surprised to find patches of square yards absolutely
bare when the growing season commenced. The
next year I found the reason, when the ploughshare
revealed stores of gathered seed. From one place
where the ground was cracked I filled an oatmeal bag
with the treasure from a subterranean storehouse.
“Fordson” : What’s the highest maize stick
ever grown in Australia? Several years back on
this farm (Toogoolawah, Q.) we had a patch of
maize, about 10 acres, and it was almost impossible
to pick out one stalk which measured less than 10ft.
Half the patch was over 12 ft., and there were at
least a couple of dozen stalks measuring over 14ft.
We took several stalks
home and stood them
against the house, apd
the top of one pro-
jected a little above
the guttering—-a heignt
of 154 ft. If anyone
in the Council refuses
to believe this, let him
specify his address, and
he’ll receive a photo
by return mail. More
than half the crop had
to be broken down to
get the cobs off.
* *
“Hayband’’: Re
endurance. I have seen
some gory accidents,
and the leading feature
of most of them has
been the calmness of
the victims. I once
watched a young fel-
low, most of whose arm
had gone into a chaff -
, cutter, quietly direct
the bandaging of the
stump. Another time,
at Numurkah (Vic.), a
man’s leg was torn
through the grain-of-
. wheat spaces of a
1200-a-minute thresher
drum. As the dreadful
smash was laboriously
wound out again
he cracked a joke
about the money he’d
save on boots. An hour
later Death called. A
Victim of the Rich-
mond (Vic.) railway
smash of 1908 was
lying on his back on
the station,, too broken
up to move. “Anything
we can do?” he was
asked. “No,” he re-
plied ; then added,
“Yes, there is—get me
a cigarette.” Three draws -and his spark of life
flickered out through the smoke. It seems to me
that in Case of serious accident Nature has some
way of buffering tne shock and pain to the victim.
“Dune”: And even now my wife says she
didn’t mean any harm. I was out the other day
with her and the kids in the garden. An old fence
had been removed several days before, and a careless
Dunelet dropped a handkerchief into one of the vacant
holes. She was about to pick it out, when Mrs.
Dune’s voice came from behind: “Don’t put your
hand down, dear—there might be a snake in that,
hole. Get your father to put his arm in for it.”
* * -X- *
“Balbus” : I hope nobody will be injured
in the inevitable scramble to rid “N.C.” (8..
14/2/’24) for ever of the delusion that Nuilarbor is
a native name. It is just' about as aboriginal as
Anzac is Turkish. Whoever it was that christened
the depressing plain—Eyre, probably, but I am not
YES, THE DEAR MAN.
MRS. MAGUIRE: “And have you survived the blow of
yer ’usband’s death then, Mrs. Murphy?”
MRS. MURPHY: “Sure an’ I have, and more than wan,
ow of him, p'ace to ’im!”
sure—of course had in his mind the two lines from
Horace:—
Pone me pigris übi nulla campis
Arbor aestiva recreatur aura.
There is nothing more felicitous in «--■
clature. The only trouble is that half of the maps
have already begun to drop the first, “r,” and
present the word as Nullabor, one result of which
is that many people pronounce it as if the accent
were on the first syllable instead of the second.

1 love your battered and blackened bowl,
Though it’s girdled with grimy string
Anu not as iresh as a violet
Or the roses that bloom in Spring.
There s sealing-wax where there once were cracks
That were- riven by coals of fire;
" ith clc nching teeth I have split your stem
That is bound with a copper wire.

While the minutes are creeping slow,
Though worn and spent, I can feel content
As I gaze at your cheerful glow.

Be it dull or a lonesome day;
And many an ugly hasty whim
You have helped to chase away.
1\ hen 1 scrape you out, with a well-worn blade,
There is little left but the bark ;
Tet your draught is cool as a morning breeze
While there is a smouldering spark.
There’s a dark-rimmed hole in my old brown coat
That was burnt as you lay at rest;
The pockets are soiled with the dusty ash
And a patch is stained on the vest.
They say you’re killing me inch by inch,
That you’re sapping the life of me;
But if you murder with full intent
You are doing it pleasantly.
They leave the room as I take you out,
And call you a name that is vile;
They say you’re the foulest thing on Earth—
They can smell you at half a mile!
but you were the gift of a mate that’s gone—
The best that he had to give,
Eor scant was the store of luxury
In the life that was his to live.
He was a man of a thousand men
And a mate that could do no wrong;
And for his good sake I could never break
With the pipe I have loved so long.

“Dune”: Here are two more horses’
broken legs which might interest “Yarrum” (B.
7/2/’24). When I was a kid living at Randwick, I
saw a racehorse, the Optimist, being taken past our
house to Stewart’s veterinary hospital in a cart. It
had fallen in a race and broken its leg, and
Stewart had asked that it be spared and he would
fix the leg sufficiently to allow the prad to take over
stud duty. As far as I know it recovered all right.
Again, a sulky mare owned by Bob McCrone, of Mir
rool, broke her leg, and they' put it in splints, and the
mare (aged) recovered. She was to have been used
for breeding purposes, but whether she ever had a
foal I don’t know. According to a statement
made by numerous bush vets., she had tusks, and
their tale is that a mare with tusks is barren. Now
you can argue about that.
“Lester Way”: Recent pars, about big
trees recall that an immense fig has had the Town
Council of Cairns (N. 0.) perplexed well nigh to dis-
traction these last few years. It grows almost in
the centre of the main street, successfully blocks all
traffic on its side, and spreads out almost to the
opposite footpath, so that only the continual lopping
of its branches prevents complete stagnation. But
its roots have worse habits than its branches—they'
are forever cropping out at the most awkward places,
pushing through the pavement, dislocating the foot-
path, and trying their strength against some of the
city’s proudest buildings by playfully lifting up
corners of the foundations without the owner’s per-
mission. It is an old and beloved landmark, and
every time the council has threatened to cut it
down a revolution has rumbled. It made a nice
pet in the city’s infancy; but now Cairns is like
the man who reared a baby elephant in a 6 x 8
kitchen.
“Toko”: How’s this for horse sense?
Darky was the nag who used to take us weekly to
town, and as a result of his light labors w'as
so hard to catch that I generally had to adopt the
conventional method of enticing him with a carrot.
One morning I caught him as usual, and Darky car-
ried the bait in his mouth as we made for the har-
ness shed. Crossing over a gravel path, however, he
dropped it, and when I allowed him to recover it
the vegetable was covered with grit and gravel.
Reaching the shed the old codger dropped his prize
again, caught it firmly by the butt, and wiped it
carefully backwards and forwards on a tuft of grass
until the grit was removed. Then he had his
little snack.
“Surcingle” : This is liow Ringo, an abo.
employed on my dad’s station, used to train (not
break) young prads.
A couple of youngsters
would be brought into
the home paddock and
left to roam with a
halter on for a few
days. A bridle with a
rubber bit would then
replace the halter, the
short reins being
attached to a wide
girth. In this way
the horses would learn
the feel of the bit and
the pull of the reins
as their heads swung
to right or left. Two
days of this, and long
reins would be fitted.
Ringo would then
spend two or three
hours giving each
horse a series of turns
designed to complete
the mouthing. Ructions
seldom followed the
buckling on of an old
stock saddle, as the
youngsters had pre-
viously become accus-
tomed to the feel of
the wide girth. It
was a different tale,
however, when a heavy
bag of sand was
strapped to the saddle
and the prad let loose ;
but he would soon
settle dow'n to the
weight on his back
and after the perform-
ance had been repeated
two or three times
could easily be
mounted. Ring o’s
methods might be con-
sidered unconventional,
but tile prads he turned
out were big-hearted
beasts and excellent
saddle-horses. Most of
them found their way
to India as army re-
mounts.
“Jimmy Possum”: A more-easily procured
and better marking-ink than the juice of a plum
or other wild fruit (B. 3/l/’24) is the gravy of
a “hundred legs.” When you’ve any linen to brand
crush a couple of the stinkers, which can usually be
found by turning over a decaying log, and use the
raw product like ordinary ink. This stain won’t
wash or boil out under ordinary treatment, and its
color is decidedly pleasing, being a sort of a pinkish
brown. I discovered this “ink” through leaning
one wet day against a dry tree, up which a centipede
w'as crawling. But a word of warning: Don’t take a
sniff at this dye-stuff unless there’s a doctor handy—
it stuns at lOOj'ds. -

“AdeL” : What birds have a greater selec-
tion of building sites
than the star finches
(Hath Hda ruficaudu)
of North Australia?
They fashion their
rough, grassy nests in
all kinds of shrubs,
though thickly lea ted
trees are much liked,
as are the hollows in
dead trees and logs,
and they love a line of
fence, where they con-
gregate in hundreds to
nest in the hollow posts
and under the bark.
They even build foil
the bare ground
near a tussock or a
log. The cavities be-
tween the spires of
aerial termites’ nests
have great attraction,
and they very much
like abandoned king-
fishers’ nests in termite
mounds. They also
have a fancy' for bough
sheds and stacks; but
of all the places they
select none are so much
coveted as an old
eagle’s nest—l have
counted as many 3S
67 nests between the
sticks of one of the big
hawk’s mansions. Inci-
dentally, why do these
birds put in their nests
the small pieces of
charcoal which are in-
variably found with the eggs?
* * * *
“FY7” : The mortality among the Mclntyre
River fish, as described by “Nitric” (B. 31/l/’24),
is a commonplace happening when Western rivers are
flooded after a long dry spell. The fine silt of the
flood waters blocks the gill apparatus _ and literally
suffocates the fish. The greatest slaughter of the
■ sort I can recall was at Northampton Downs, on the
Barcoo, in the ’eighties. The owners had put up
a big scouring plant about 10 miles up-stream from
the station, and the waste from the scouring was
run into a big waterhole in the river. When the
flood came it carried the yolk-impregnated water
into the lower holes, with the result that the fish
died literally in thousands—the banks were
white with them in some places. The incident
made such an impression that the waste was
diverted to a lignum lagoon; bnt fish were scarce in
that section of the Barcoo for years afterwards.
“Lamornie”: Re hydrocyanic-acid poison-
ing of stock. The following may be of use to
stockowners who grow sorghums, etc., which are,
incidentally, most poisonous when under a foot high,
and again just as the seed is forming. For a
poisoned horse or cow mix a heaped tablespoonful oi
hyposulphate of soda in a pint of raw linseed oil
and administer as a drench. This is effective pro
viding rigors have not commenced. When the
animal is recovering at times it becomes very savage
for a short period—l carry marks received from a
Clydesdale mare which cornered me in a stall.
Sheep poisoned through eating millet can be treated
in the same way, the dose being one-tenth of that
given to horses and cattle; but one must treat the
patient as quickly as possible, as in sheep the poison
takes effect more rapidly. P.S. —I have no record
of sheep becoming Savage when recovering.

“The Deacon” finds some literature:—
Had “Rio” (B. 31/l/’24) been following up a
well-known series of detective yarns turned out regu-
larly in Britain, he wouldn’t have been surprised at
the prevailing notion that Australians still wear red
shirts. In a recent number that the schoolboys of
the Dominions are provided with, the “schoolmaster-
detective” in pursuit of his quarry arrives in Sydney
on April 16, 19—, and takes a special train as far
as Nyngan. Thence he sets out on a 60-mile ride
to a sheep-station, but on the way finds the country
and the citizens very bad indeed. Making better
time than the most hardened bushman, he has covered
40 miles, when he hears ear-splitting screams and
roars of brutal laughter. He races to a “planta-
tion,” and this sight petrifies him: “Hanging head
downwards from the branch of a tree immediately
over a blazing bonfire was the writhing form of an
Australian native, while, shaking their sides with
laughter, were half a dozen villainous-looking miners.
Bach had a rifle by his side.” Then follows a description
of their leader, “Black Pete,” who, with his five
cobbers, on a Sunday-afternoon stroll had “captured
the native,” and set out to amuse themselves. (The
accompanying illustration shows typical early Ameri-
can miners.) But the schoolmaster-d. jumped in and
put the six ruffians to flight without a blow being
struck, and cut the nigger down while bullets out
of the “wood” whistled all round. After that he
fought three of the biggest for a whole minute before
he was caught and slung up by the arms to a neigh-
boring tree “over a ravine.” Then a shooting bee
was arranged—the man who could cut both ropes,
and so drop him to his death, taking his hired hack
as the prize. However, when one rope had been
cut (at 200 paces!) a timely boomerang spoilt
Black Pete’s second shot, and he tumbled into the
“abyss.” Then a score of “bushy-headed natives,
led by their head-man, or chief,” put the eomither
on these desperate miners (40 miles from Nyngan,
N.S.W.), who immediately bolted for further armed
reinforcements, “amid a random volley of revolver

shots. So the nigger gives the d. this advice: “Hen
you jump on horse, we draw bad white fellows
and lead dem on wrong trail. Black fellows dey
mighty clever dat way.” So the d. hops on his horse
jnd “beats it.” Is it any wonder that outsiders
have these absurd notions about us?
THE WHIRL WE LIVE IN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
To this world’s glories priests attest; yet it is full
of woe,
And sharks whose creed is greed infest the oceans
as they flow.
In fairest spots volcanoes smoke; and spread a warn-
ing pall;
Then Nature his her sorry joke—an earthquake
swallows all.
In forest dark slv tigers claw giraffes and ante-
lopes,
While men who break Mosaic law are hanged on
hempen ropes ;
Brown women flaunt their bodies bare, but white
girls wear the clout,
And capes of hair from slaughtered beasts their
shoulders hang about;
The wealthy ride in motor-cars—this .world is hard
or good
For such as starve beneath the stars or feast on
sultan’s food.
In mansions women dwell in dread of scandalous
report;
The feathered pheasant, covert bred, a victim falls
to “sport” ;
The lain that graciously descends on thirsty paddock
mould
Falls wet y on pneumonic friends who die of catching
cold.
Our wondrous world is full of weal, and also full
of woe ;
Some folks no need of knowledge fee] that none
can ever know.
All painters’ art is but a craze whereat Dame Nature
smiles ;
The poet, with his dream of bays, vain self-conceit
beguiles ;
The writer’s craft is but a test of skill in teliing
lies:
An honest fool who stands contest is wisest of the
wise.
No culture known to mortals yet has rid the world
of mice:
No human virtue can we get without its kindred
vice;
No spiritual nature lives save on an earthly plan.
The animal existence gives to procreative man.
Our souls may he immortal, but no eye a soul has
seen
Returning through a door that’s shut to state where
it has been.
Oh, say, is Heaven up above, or in a world elsewhere,
And is it wrong to be in love with aught but “praise
and prayer” ?
And can a person righteous be who seeks not to
deceive
His mental self, believing he no dogmas can believe?
This world is full of fraud and sham as well as
wind and woe,
And what 1 was, will be, or am, I know I may
not know.
This world of sunshine and of storm, this world of
joy and woe,
Whose face is sometimes brown and warm, and
sometimes white as snow;
Where insects live on insect food, and fishes feed
on fish,
EXACTNESS.
F AT: “Does this ’ere pub serve counter
lunch?”
T'OTHER: “Oh, yes.”
FAT: “Any good?”
T’OTHER: “Well, the salt’s not bad.”
And few men dare indulge a mood or gratify a wish
Whilst working for a daily wage, or toiling for a
crust;
Where mummers all must quit the stage, and dust
returns to dust —
This universe has got me beat. But idle is com-
plaint:
A sinner cannot riddles treat as though he were a
saint.
The parched wastes of desert sand; the crowded
city’s hum;
The palm-trees on a coral strand: the babes born
deaf and dumb;
The plants that breed on heights unsealed, whose
blossoms bloom and wilt;
The modest worth in silence veiled, the fame on
fiction built;
PITHNETH BEFORE PLEASURE.
PADDY'S MARKET COSTUMIER: “Ikey, come quick! Here's a drunk
customer mit a roll of notes rants a check suit, and you're
rearing the only one re ’are in stock. Come quick!”
The senseless war, by fate controlled, that smites
the strong and young,
But leaves the weary and the old with still their
knells unrung ;
The deadly berry growing wild and looking nice lo
eat,
\\ hose poison tempts the sturdy child —that berry
has me beat.
These things are in the world so fair, the world
so full of woe:
And why they- are I do not care because 1 may not
know.
VICTORIA.

SOW SCIENTIFICALLY
Place the seed and the fertiliser on a level compacted sub-surface, and cover it with a mulch of finely-pulverised soil. This conserves
the moisture, hastens germination, ensures vigorous growth, and increases the yield.
To do this on a large scale we recommend the “Sun-tyne” drill with 17, 25, 29, 33 or 41 tynes, sowing respectively 8, 12, 14, 16 or 20 rows, 7 inches apart.
Thousands of these are used by farmers who have proved the great advantage of using this modern Australian invention.

The Mooltan, which weighed anchor on
Tuesday after lying for three weeks alongside
the P. and O. wharf in somewhat sullen
splendor, made the grand gesture one night
last week and invited society to dance over
her mile-or-so-long decks. Much greenery
and fiaggery cheered up the liner’s usually
morose appearance, and the jazz band and
a good buffet did the rest. Nearly every
fourth dancer was an intending tripper, and
these made it a personal matter that friends
and acquaintances should view the glories of
the fittings in the cabins below. The dance
was the biggest social gathering for weeks ;
and the Gordon Wesche couple, who stood at
the head of the gangway receiving the guests,
must have felt like Mr. and Mrs. Noah usher-
ing the animals into the ark, while Captain
Finch and his merry men thanked their
gods that they who go down to the sea
in ships have a few interludes at the ports.
Mrs. Wesche, who with her P. and O. chief
is among those who sailed away, was sup-
ported in her hostess act by handsome black
satin frocking that gleamed with rich jet. The
good-looking Waley lady mingled black lace
and pearls with the happiest result, and had
a knight out (no scandal —lie’s her own)
and the two chicks. Eileen in bepuffed apple-
green taffetas with which she sported
Morocco-red shoes, and Cccile a study in old
gold. Tall Muffle Layton stuck to black;
and the same sombre tones threw Mrs.
Jimmie Burns’s good complexion into relief.
The two Beale girls came, and Margaret and
Betty Chalmers were among the dancers; the
Sheldon dame brought her two buds; and
Barbara Bowker emerged like a rose-maiden
from a frock that glistened as though the
icy breath of winter had blown upon it.
The brunette Mrs. Alfred Turnbull evoked a
gipsy-like charm from old rose. The Crau-
furds added Naval support to the gathering,
and Gwen Nelson the only shingled head.
There’s a rumor abroad that after the
public inspection of the Mooltan the other
Saturday, the smoking rooms and lounges
were picked clean of their pocketable furnish-
ings. Inkwells seem to have had a particu-
lar attraction, but small covers and odds and
ends were not overlooked by the locust
visitors.
A clever and much-feted visitor is Mrs.
Sanderson-Furniss, wife of the principal of
Ruskin College, now in Sydney. She has
been casting some illumination on the hous-
ing conditions of the poor of England, even
of classic Oxford, that make the Australian
housewife shiver. Talking to a group of
trainees the other day, Mrs. Furniss told of
her experiences as a member of the W.E.A.
Part of her job is to lecture a class of
middle-aged working women on English. At
the end of the term one elderly housewife
ended up an essay on “The Day’s Work”
by remarking that every night she prayed
the Almighty for a certain sanitary conveni-
ence with a good flush to it. Evidently
Oxford local authorities are stronger on
Homer than on the Home. The lady is a
good dresser, and a certain bell-like sleeve
of one frock so impressed two of Sydney’s
public women that they are wondering if
the lecturer would mind giving them the
pattern.
Another promised French-Australian
League which is cheering Stratlifield is that
of Rita Adams and Fernand Playoust, of
the woolbuying Playousts. Rita is flashing
the usual engagement signal. Jaqucs, of the
same family, takes his wife and little Nan-
ette off to see the little lady’s people by
the outgoing Orient boat. This will be his
first visit since he shed his poilu’s field-
blue. In the early stages of the war he was
in the ranks; then, having spent practically
all his life in Australia, and with a know-
ledge of English and German as complete as
his French, he was sent adrift as an inter-
preter and liaison officer. In that capa-
city he once met a mob of mounted Diggers
taking their ease. He is no horseman, and
the ribald Diggers found great joy in the
“poor Froggie’s” difficulties —especially when
his cap got . adrift. But, having mastered
his horse, the “poor Froggie”—who, of
course, wasn’t expected to know a word of
English, or Australian —rode back to the
mob, and handed out with astonishing fluency
all the most vigorous Australian he had
learned in his 20-odd years’ handling of
Australian fleeces and Australian fleece-
growers. Fritz never surprised that mob half
as much as the “poor Froggie” did. And
Fritz never got such a cheer either.
Another eligible of Hunter’s Hill has gone
to the land for his best girl. He is William
Dixon, and the girl on whose heart and left
hand he has pegged out his option is Lorna
Street, of Murwillumbali, Tweed River.
Who remembers Vera (“Chookie”) Gain-
ford, belle of Neutral Bay for many years:
She lately became Lady Maxwell-Willshire,
wife of Gerard, third baronet of his line.
Vera had been carrying on a millinery busi-
ness, under the sign of Cordelia, in Madison-
ayenue, New York. In July of last year
Sir Gerard and his first wife, who was Lilian
Birtles on the stage, were divorced. Her new
husband is G. W. Higgs, of the Royal Air
Force.
Pretty Beryl Alexander, of Bellevue Hill,
has made violinist Misclia Dobrinski the hap-
piest fiddler in or out of Russia. In fact,
that exile from Petrograd-that-was is begin-
ning to think world-convulsions may have
their bright side. Through them he came to
Australia five months ago and met Beryl and
his fate. The wedding bells ring in a few
months’ time.
A pretty bride of the week was Marie
Cagey, of Randwick, who murmured her
vows iu the Sacred Heart Church of that
parish, and then went off with Dr. Clifford
Gearin. Dark-haired Marie was enwrapped
in vellum-toned panne velvet that swished
a short silver-lined train. Her bouquet of
real orange blossom was supported at the
critical moment by Evelyn Lynch, of Auck-
land, who ’maided in a confection of silver
lace and moire of a melting blue. Usher’s
spread the wedding dinner, and the honey-
moon shines in Tasmania and Melbourne.
The Ormuz brought back the pretty Ains-
worth chicks, Ruth and Fay, after 12 glori-
ous months in Europe. They traversed miles
of picture galleries under the eclectic guid-
ance of youthful aunt Lute Drummond;
they learned the architecture of every cathe-
dral with any reputation at all; they rested
in Joan of Arc’s country; they listened to
opera in every big city of the Continent. In
Munich they heard “The Twilight of the
Gods,” taking their evening meal with them,
for this is an afternoon plus evening per-
formance. In London “Anna Christie,” in
drama, and “The Immortal Hour,” in music,
were the two performances that most
stirred their imagination. In Naples they
heard the famous beauty Hidalgo in “Tra-
viata” ; and in Vienna the Hungarian violin-
ist Vecsey. They made a pilgrimage to
Wales to drink at the fount of Steiner,
the Master of anthroposophy ; and in Naples
they left Lute and finished their homeward
flight alone.
Greet Mrs. Wisdom, whose Brigadier-
General husband is the Commonwealth's
Administrator at Rabaul. Under her sway
Government House is the most popular insti-
tution in the
T e r r i t o r y
—always in a
state of hold-
in g a party or
getting- over
one or prepar-
ing for one;
and this in
spite of the
total absence
of bands, brass
or jazz. Gov-
ernment House
has an idyllic
situation in a
little valley
between Mount
Mother an d
her offspring.
North and
South Daugh-
ter. It has
both a harbor
and an ocean
frontage, with a fringe of mountain range
on either side, and its chief domestic
pet is the gentle tarantula which
vacuums up the prolific cockroach. The
cook-boj of Rabaul isn’t so cheap a luxury
as the advocate of colored labor might think
—Mrs A\ isdom s Chinese food-artist costs
her £l4 a month. The Kanaka boy with
his hibiscus-threaded thatch is a less expen-
sive but more elemental help.
The Administrator-lady’s latest role is
that of Librarian-iii-Chief at Rabaul The
!. lced of books has been so badly felt by
iar-afield expropriation officers and planters
that the mistress of the Rig House felt some-
thing must be done, so she founded a library
much on the lines of the Rush Rook Club—
a guinea a year is the subscription—and
regularly to those who sit in outer darkness
boxes of books are shipped. On the return
voyage the box comes back filled with the
reads, and the programme is repeated over
again. In the intervals the committee feverv
woman m Rabaul is on it) repairs the
books puts covers on them, disinfects them,
and keeps them fit for travelling till tliev
literally perish of old age. Mrs. Wisdom
before she became an Australian was a
Scotch lass, and hails from Edinburgh, the
city of Culture and Statues—or. as the
gnmy, bustling Glaswegian will tell you
of Pride and Poverty.
On their way to Sydney are Mrs. Floyd,
who has been visiting her native Ireland and
France when not staying with her friends
the Ewen Frasers in London; and Rosa
Gore, th a clever managing-director of Dor-
rien’s, who comes back to her home-city
after a tour of the big fashion-builders of
the Continent. Miss Gore’s headquarters
were at Mrs. Edward Noyes’s new country
home, which carries acres of shooting, and
is in the heart of one of the hunting
counties.
Here’s Francis Halls, who has brought his
rich basso-baritone back to Australia after
some years’ study in Italy and London. In
Italy lie studied with Mario Pieraccini, the
teacher whose motto is: "Look after the
breathing and the voice takes care of itself.”
For eight
months the

ing exercises.
The songbird
is a native
of Adelaide.
There he won
the Elder
scholarship foi
singing, and
he had for
teacher Fred
Bevau, whose
pen created
those old-
time favorites,
“T h e A d-
mira 1 ’ s
Broom’’ and
“The Flight
of Ages.” In
L ondo n he
had engage-
merits at the Albert Hall and the Palladium,
besides singing for such historic Business
Men’s Societies as the Choughs. He took
part in a production of the “Messiah” in
Edinburgh; and it was in the same oratorio
he repatriated himself, giving a fine perform-
ance in Melbourne with the Philharmonics,
in Sydney with the same society, and in
Adelaide with the Bachs.
Mrs. Shasta Bertini’s afternoon concert at
the Children’s Hospital Cafe will help on
that institution, which is a regular money-
spinner for the sick youngsters. The big
room was gay with flowers and the brilliant
tones of summer frocking. Secretary Clar-
ence Moss introduced the organiser of the
afternoon’s entertainment, who dimpled over
the posy presented to her by the girl-workers
of the cafe, and later on poured out her rich
contralto in “Sink Red Sun.” Palmer Kent
added his own composition, “Sea Gulls,” to
the waves of music; and Mab Pothering-
hame, Hilda Boyle, Doreen Douglass, Laura
Leslie and Sydney Northey gave gallant
support to the bill. This hospital cafe is
worked by Mrs, Howard Harrison and a
band of voluntary helpers, and already it
has dropped £2500 into the funds.
A lire at the Good Samaritan Convent, at
Randwick, on Saturday wiped out another
landmark of old Sydney. Until a few years
ago the stone building was Bisliopscourt,
the home of the chief Anglican apron from
the time of Bishop Barker, in 1859. Then
plebeian Randwick was exchanged for more
aristocratic Darling Point as.an episcopal
residence, and the old Anglican building
’verted to the R.C.’s.
In the interests of the Girls’ Realm Guild
Joan Rayner gave early this week an in-
teresting performance of the Green Leaf
Theatre methods. They proved a combina-
tion of song and movement and story. Miss
Rayner made an attractive exponent of the
innocuous art that seems more fitted for
children than grown-ups. There seems in
this Green Leaf Theatre method an over-
abundance of suiting the action to the word ;
and Joan’s voice was obviously tired out
half-way through the programme. No won-
der—a one-woman programme that started
at 8, and wasn’t over at half-past 9 ! The
vice-regal Cullens were in the front row.
Moiseiwitsch is that rare thing, a good
friend. Not satisfied with introducing Roy
Agnew’s compositions to London last year,
the great pianist signalised Roy’s arrival
in the big city by billing the Australian’s
‘Toccata Tragica” for his concert at the
Queen’s Hall on January 15. After the
“Toccata,” into which the pianist put every
bit of his interpretative genius, Moiseiwitsch
was recalled four times. Roy has met
Arnold Bax, and dined with William Mur-
doch and violinist Sammons.
Merle Robertson, a gifted girl pianist, who
left Australia to study with Fanny Davies
in London, has filled in the years doing splen-
did things—concert work under Charles
Stanford and Adrian Boult; study with
Eugen d’Albert (and he in his time studied
under Liszt) ; lately an appearance at the
Steinway Hall, for which she received tre-
mendous notices from the London critics.
The clever girl Commences a season at the
Conservatorium in April.
The Mayoress handed over a neat little
cheque to Mrs. Fox-Benson the other day
at the Wentworth, where a farewell tea-
drinking took place in the departing pen-
woman’s honor. Mrs. Val. Osborne and
Government House Official-Secretary Budge
had organised the flutter, with strong support
from Mrs. Davey and Mrs. Fotheringhame.
The chiefs of the Benevolent Society were
there and made speeches; Owen Cox looked
in for a minute to murmur farewell and
leave a wonderful sachet from niece Miss
Bonsor; the two clever Maclean girls came;
and Mrs. Budge represented her husband,
who was away shepherding Dudley Rawson
de Chair through his first Australian en-
tanglements.
Here’s something that none of the City
of the Pacific’s jazz bands can boast. At St.
Moritz a Sydney visitor saw two men play-
ing on ordinary cross-cut saws. These they
massaged and beat and tickled with softly-
covered dinner-gong hammers. The Sydney
girl says the resulting sounds had some-
thing of the wailing plaintiveness of the
ukulele.
Custom uses us to everything—even to
princes. What with the wholesale inter-
marrying of royalties and commoners and
the daily juggling with Russian titles, the
palpitating over Prince George’s approach
is scarcely visible. Only here and there
can one hear of a girl who is having her
southern elevation massaged daily in view
of the return of the backless dance-frock and
the arrival of the lads in blue who blench at
naught. There should be a social traffic-
constable on the job; if we of “the Colonies”
are to retain our native reverence we should
be permitted not more than one prince in
five years.
A Brisbane postscript:
Among those who were fed by Sir Matthew at
Government House the other evening were soldier
J. H. Bruche and his wife and daughters, A. 11.
Whittingham and his lady, and Hal and Guy
L’Estrange. Afterwards the party, with Jack Tur-
ner, A.D.C., as rear-guard, went off to the Theatre
Royal to see how the Reynolds-de Tisnc Co. dealt
with Shakepeare.
A day of two later Sir Matthew went to the
wedding of Nancy Macnaughton and J. Baring-Gould,
of Penang. The stage was set at St. John’s Cathedi*l,
and the grounds were chock-a-block with those who
came to see. The bridegroom is a son of the late
novelist Baring Gould, and Nancy is Judge Alac-
naughton’s one ewe lamb. An altar covered with
white blooms had a background of palms; and
white ribbons showed the guests where to sit.
Handsome Nancy, who was given away by father,
was in a gown of kitten’s-ear satin over pink ninon,
a jewelled buckle catching the classic draperies at
one sieje. A very long satin train fell from the
shoulders and parted at the waist to make two trains.
It was lined with pink, and wee sprays of orange-
blossoms climbed on the shoulders. Mrs. Albert
White lent the Venetian lace veil, a thing of
beauty which was finished at the headpiece with
pale pink ribbons and orange flowers. Elsie Fer-
guson, in autumn-leaf shaded georgette with a gold-
banded head-dress and a handful of tango-colored
dahlias, bridesmaided, and Roslyn Tozer and Ann
■Williams were trainbearers in buttercup organdie
and poke bonnets. Lex Macnaughton best-manned.
The Bellevue saw the wedding feast, whereat Mrs.
Macnaughton appeared in powder-blue, with silver,
and a black hat, and the bride’s grandmother in
grey silk.
Before the wedding Mrs. Macnaughton gathered
together two or three hundred guests to take tea at
the Bellevue in Nancy’s honor. Mrs. Alan Jeffrey
was the other hostess, and Nancy helped to receive
the crowd at the doors of the lounge. Roses and
gerberas and Easter lilies took part; there was a
band and jazz and a thermometer showing 92 deg.,
so everyone had a good time. During the week
Elsie Ferguson staged a dinner-dance at the Belle-
vue, also in Nancy’s honor.
Gn the same afternoon the Brisbane Shakspeare
Society, amid bunches of red dahlias and regretful
speeches, farewelled the T. AV. Heneys. Professor
Stable, after remarking that parting was such sweet
sorrow, handed the flitting editor a life-membership
certificate. Mrs. Ileney had a separate little affair,
the Philp lady hostessing a tea-drinking at the
Botanic Gardens.
Mrs. Faulkner, Brisbane’s Mayoress, is off to the
Gold Country for a trip, and a lot of women clubbed
together to give her an illuminated address and a
solid leather suitcase. Sir Matthew made the
presentation, Mrs. Grave read the address, some
Cremorne Diggers made music, and the committee
poured a dish of tea.
Some pretty frocks were on the lawn at Ascot
races. Mrs. Rockhampton O’Brien sported white
voile and lace and an ivory-white hat; Mrs. Stanley
Chapman was in pink muslin, and pretty- Bebe Bul-
cock in mauve and w hite; Mrs. Percy Rear had
touches of blue on her steel grey; and Mrs. Lake
Nash Sutton was in blue.
Mrs. E. T. Real gave a tea at Lennon’s for Mar-
jorie Byram, who is shortly to marry squatter Lips-
combe. Mrs. George Addison, Airs. McNab, Enid
North, Joyce Darwell, the Hawthorns and Hord-
rnanns were among the cup-lifters. Marjorie is a
tall, handsome girl, the only sister of Ronald, who
was with Gregan McMahon and a promising player
ere pneumonic ’flu carried him off.
Brisbane gymnasium has said good-bye to J. V
Devoy and handed him a gold life-membership badge.
Devov has been a working • member of the Gym.
for 30 years and is now off on holiday to the
Cold Country.
Rockhampton has just been wiping its eye for old
Airs. Stoward, widow of an ex-mayor of Maryborough
who died over half a century ago. She was a native
of Ireland, and a brother was one of those who
went down in the Birkenhead.

A series of tea-drinkings and such-like
minor dissipations has chipped the edges of
the social ice, but the break-up will not set
in until Fleet Week, when the whole town
will wobble with jazz and frivolity—in fact,
the functions already listed are far too tight
a fit for the brief period. While Toorak is
catering for the gold-laced officers, St. Kilda
is throwing itself into the task of looking
after the bluejackets. Several hectic jazzers
are preparing to follow the festivities from
State to State, and all the new cliiffonery
is being kept in reserve. The opening jazz,
which will serve the dual purpose of enter-
taining the captains, loots and snotties and
building up the Queen Vic. Hospital appeal
fund, threatens to out-dazzle any previous
charity effort. All the Best Known are
taking a hand in arranging the function,
which means that only those who get in
early will be able to secure a guinea ticket.
Our Earl was away at Nerin Neriu, Agar
Wynne’s homestead in the south-west, duck-
shooting, when solicitor Eggleston, of St.
Kilda, was appointed Minister for Water
Supply. As a former representative of St.
Kilda himself, and a member of several
Ministries, State and Federal, Wynne would
have been delighted to accommodate an
Executive Council meeting, with his Ex. in
the chair, to swear-in Eggleston; but the
opportunity was let slip. The Ministry
Wynne was in when he was member for St.
Kilda lasted only four months. He might
have been tempted to mention that, and the
new Minister might have felt discouraged;
so perhaps it was better that Eggleston
should lose six days’ pay.
Gent.-help Mulliolland was hurried into
a private hospital the other day to part with
his appendix, and he is getting over it quite
nicely. The Forsters must be thanking tlicir
lucky stars at having the invalid’s parents,
the Dunleaths, with them to shoulder the
responsibility of keeping an eye on him. The
last vice-regal patient to be relieved of an
appendix was little Lady Pat Blackwood.
How many Gov. House residents still carry
the risky thing about with them this de-
ponent knowetli not.
Ex-Senator Fairbairn and Lorna, only
daughter of the George Robertson widow,
were linked up with the least possible fuss
and frill at seaside Mornington last week,
and are now heading for the U.S.A. cn
route for England, where they will shelter
for some months. The Friday before assum-
ing her matrimonial fetters, the bride-elect
was given a send-off by the James Grice
daughter, Mrs. A. Howatson, who tapped
tea and music at her Toorak home, Repton.
The most expensive floral effects made pic-
turesque the different rooms; and Violet
Somerset and Reicke Parker were called
in to supply the musical numbers. Mrs.
Howatson topped cream georgette with a
rosy hat brimmed with blue, while the star
guest wore kilted navy blue with pink em-
bellishments under a blue flower-wreathed
hat. All the best chiffons were there.
The Palace Theatre scintillated on Satur-
day night when Seymour Hicks unloosed
“The Man in Dress Clothes.” All the Best
Scaters were there in their gladdest rags.
Owing to the sudden illness of leading-lady
Barbara Hoffe, Ellaline Terriss went on
and saved the situation, though she had
never played the part before. The vice-regal
Forsters’ party overflowed from their gold
pen to the front circle. Her Ex. lifted a
black-and-gold brocaded covering to reveal
filmy blue, dew-dropped with glittering beads.
Lady Dunleath sat with her in black. Lady
Ellen Lambert’s grey shingled head reared
itself above white fox fur in the circle,-and
little Lady Pat Blackwood radiated in bright
rose, while Mrs. Pitt Rivers cloaked a golden
frock with green brocade. Melba, in clouds
of pink chiffon, was boxed with Mrs. Fred
Payne, who wore severely-cut mauve. With
them were the übiquitous Tommy Cochran
and another.
Ellaline Terriss aired some dresses of
a cut just a little previous to our present
fashions. No. 1 trailed satin folds of cinna-
mon silk, surpliced with shimmering crepe
of a paler shade bordered with fur. With
it she wore a brown fur stole and a ravish-
ing hat of brown chiffon velvet, which had
a paste buckle at one side of the partly-
upturned brim. Frock No. 2 was an even-
ing affair of black velvet, hiding under a
black velvet coat. By the way, the dressing
in this scene (a cafe) emphasised the nice
difference between the frocking of a lady of
fashion and a daughter of joy. (“Cafes,’
says the waiter, “are places of high
feeding and low thinking.’’) Joan King-
don, the Daughter of Joy, opened up
with silver panellings studded with cry-
stal, and slashed each side with flame
color which concluded with a mammoth bow.
A flame-colored feathered hat and cloak
were added later, and she ended up in sky
blue peppered with glittering beads. Mione
Stewart got more dash into her good looks
than hitherto, in a velvet brocaded cloak
hemmed in with white fur under a big red
hat with plumes of the same hectic coloring.
Last week's terrifying cloud-burst, which
converted Melbourne streets into waterways,
exploded just as the Baillieu-Lavers wedding
party was safely havened in No. 9 Darling-
street, and ceased firing with similar sud-
denness just as the newly-weds were setting
off on their honeymoon. Petticoated sight-
seers flooded the little church round the cor-
ner of the C. of E. Grammar School, spilled
over the grassy enclosures, and backwashed
on to the road. Inside the edifice the hoi
polloi, determined to miss nothing, stood
along the pew-seats in massed formation,
giggling and chatting as if they were at
a circus. One heavily-powdered trio clam-
bered on to the seat-back and peeked oyer
the screen behind which the registry-signing
was taking place.
The little bride suggested a snowdrop en-
tangled in a silvery moonbeam as she faced
the Voice that Breathed on Hugh Ward's
arm. Her white georgette draperies, deli-
cately enmeshed with silver and looped with
orange flowers, was backed by a silver tissue
stream flowing under the bridal tulle. More
tissue bound her head, with an anchoring of
blossoms, and water-lilies gleamed on her
arm. Sunday Baillieu and the bride's small
niece, Bonnie Chcffers, made an agreeable
duo in blue organdie inlaid with embroid-
eries under black velvet bonnets carrying
what looked like colored feather-dusters, and
each held a gold basket stocked with damask
roses. Bridegroom King Baillieu, who is
handsome as a Round-Table knight, had the
support of John Cliirnside, also a good-
looker ; and the youngest Arthur Baillieu
son, Everard, squired little Bonnie. The
leading men and Hugh Ward and Keith
Murdoch, who acted as joint ushers with
Jack Baillieu, aired spats and tailorings
which would have won-three cheers from the
Tailor and Cutter.
About 70 relatives and a stray friend or
so clustered round the pink-flowered tables
in No. 9 Darling-street for the after-shivoo.
Chaplain Arnold, who had tied the knot and
toasted the two, was doubly interested in
the event, seeing that he had taught Gracie’s
young idea to shoot at East Melbourne St.
Peter’s, and King’s at Melbourne Grammar.
Mrs. Lavers received in black lace and geor-
gette, with a fan of plumage backing her
velvet toque. Her daughter, Mrs. Cheffers,
stood by in grey marocain with a black hat.
The bride took her final curtain in a navy
frock and black hat touched with white.
The Arthur Baillieus steam off to England
early next month with daughter Sunday and
the youngster Everard to keep their second
hope, Darrien, from feeling too homesick.
The youth is completing his scholastic career
at Cambridge. During tlieir term of travel
the Kingsbury Baillieus will keep the moths
out of the family furnishings at Toorak.
This is a Rembrandt picture of Mrs.
Benjamin Hoare, wife of Ben Hoare, of
the Age, a lady noted for her big-hearted
deeds in the- cause of charity. She is presi-
dent of
the Broad-
meadows
Foundling
Home, and
there as else-
where she
has demon-
strated that
everything she
touches in the
way of organ-
isation is well
done. A high
comp liment
was paid the
lady about 10
years ago
when she was
chosen by the
late Archbish.
Carr to be his
church’s re-
presentative or
the State Im-
migration Committee. Mrs. Iloare returned a
while back from a trip abroad, and her
Celtic eye twinkles as she tells a little story
of her presentation to King George. Imme-
diately before herself and her Benjamin,
waiting in a long queue, was Hugh O’Neil,
Speaker of the Ulster Parliament, and Mrs.
Iloare overheard a portion of the conver-
sation between him and George Rex. So
when the time came for the royal hand to
be extended to her she bent low from her
6ft. of height and murmured in the kingly
ear, “Your Majesty, be good to Ireland.”
lI.M. replied, while continuing the hand-
shake, “I’m doing my very best.”
The Herbert Ilammill widow, who died
the other day while visiting friends in Gee-
long, ieft many friends in the Western Dis-
trict and in the city. Although she had
not been feeling fit of late, few suspected
that her lack of robustness had a serious
foundation. Since the passing of her hus-
band, Mrs. Ilammill had spent most of her
time in Melbourne, where she had lived as
a girl with her parents, the late Hasting
Cuninghams, of Brookville, Toorak. The
Cuninghams are among Australia’s oldest
families, and an ancient baronetcy was lately
inherited by the oldest Hastings Cuningham
son, William Fairlie. The late Herbert
Hammill was the only brother of Mrs. Her-
bert Power.
Alma O’Dea, the little Brisbane songstress,
whose mezzo-soprano easily outpaced nine
other starters for the Melba scholarship., will
now ..train for two years under the Albert-
street Con.
banner. The
a u b u r n-
liaired lass
got all her
earlier train-
ing with the
Sisters of the
Good Samari-
tan in the
northern
State, but her
later tech-
nique was the
work of Wai-
ter Kir b y,
who was so
taken with
her voice
when she sang
at his Bris-
bane recitals
that he
promptly en-
rolled her as
a daily-lesson pupil until he quitted the
Queensland capital. Seeing that the new
Melba scholarship holder is equipped with a
nice musical understanding and the neces-
sary ambition, it looks as though she will be
heard of at the end of her Con. term. Ruskin
made this photo of her.
Young Archie Fisken crossed to the Speck
the other day to bring back the Eustace
Camerons’ second daughter, Elspeth, and
carry her to his sheep acreage, Yendon, near
Ballarat. The pair sealed the contract at
the little chapel attached to the Camerons’
Mona Vale run. Heavy rains and Swollen
streams threatened a -wash-out for the in-
vited guests, but they got there somehow,
One party motored an extra 60 miles after
being held up at a ford, and many at an-
other crossing left their cars and footed it
dizzily over a plank bridge. The bride, who
was led to the halter by her dad, trailed
shining folds of silver brocade looped with
orange blossom under the picturesque
meshes of an old Limerick lace veil lent by
the Irvine lady, and white heather flirted
with the water-lilies poaied in her hand.
Sister Maisie and a Dowbiggan Foster
daughter, Dorothy, were attendant ’maids, in
early-Victorian frocks of lilac taffetas, with
hats to match. The headgear shadowed all
but the tips of their pretty chins, and they
bore baskets spilling over with flowers of
lilac and gold. A diminutive cousin, Cath-
erine Cameron, looked after the bridal train.
Julian Smith, who went over to Tasmania
with the bridegroom, upheld him in his hour
of need, and Selwyn King stepped on as
understudy to Bill Irvine, who was unable
to fill his allotted role of ’groomsman. Two
hundred relatives and friends took part in
the after-jollo at Mona Vale. The bride-
groom is son of the late Archibald Fisken, of
Yendon. His mother was a Wanliss, and
is sister to the Irvine dame.
If Mrs. Rumor is not misleading us we
may expect to see the George Chirnside
daughter and son-in-law, the Harold Pape
pair, descend on us again from Calcutta.
His work there has been connected with
horse-racing, and he is said to be an appli-
cant for the job of handicapper to the V.R.C.
Defence Sec. Trumble’s wife and daughter
Georgie, who are accompanying the head of
the house on his nine-months’ world-tour,
were farewelled at Menzies’ with cake and
pekoe by the wives of senior headquarters
officers. Mrs. Victor Selheim received the
star guests, and in an interval the Cliauvel
dame handed Mrs. Trumble a floral nosegay
of much beauty and fragrance with the
united good wishes of the several hostesses. A
smaller posy went to Yvonne Deschamps,
who cheered the gathering with music and
song. Mrs. Trumble faced the pleasant ordeal
m navy blue silk, crested with silver beads
on the upper deck, while flowers flattered
round her hat-brim. The Cliauvel lady was
likewise navy-blued, but her hangings were
buttressed with oyster colorings to match a
becoming lid. Mrs. Selheim flew a touch of
blue on her black dress, and Georgie Trumble
livened her inky frock with a lace neck-drape
and a pink liat-wreath. Surgeon Howes’s
wife moved gracefully in black; Mrs. Eric
Harrison had silver leaves coroneting. her
black toque; and General Coxen’s other half
and the Dodds, Somerville, Macandic and
Cecil Foot matrons were some of those whe
helped to cheer Mrs. Trumble and her daugh-
ter on their way.
Little Eileen Cooper, who has charge of
the lending part of Hutchinson’s library,
celebrated her recent holiday by getting en-
gaged to Dr. Tom Muir Hendry, who belongs
to a well-known Brighton family and lately
unfurled his brass plate at Beulah.
Sydney will be invaded by 25 Vic. M’s.P.
on March. 1. ’Most of them will be accom-
panied by wives or daughters, and the whole
contingent will number between 40 and 50.
A. A. Billson, Chairman of Committees of
the Assembly, will be the leader; and Cohen,
Horn Minister, will represent the Cabinet.
Cricket, tennis, billiard- and bowls-matcbes
will be played with N.S.W. legislators. The
bat-and-ball group—-it would be satirical to
call it, a cricket eleven—will not be hard to
beat, but the bdwiePs may make a respect=
able showing. On one night the visitors
will be hosts, and Mrs. Harold .Wfiikef
(Linda Billson that was) will help her dad
to do the honors.
Mrs. George James beckoned in some
friends to the Lyceum Club the other day
to meet penwoman Baker, of the Adelaide
Register, who is here on holiday. Among
the tea-tasters was Mrs. Glencross, who built
un the Housewives’ Association, which wages
deadly war on all food profiteers. Another
guest was Madame Ivassovakaia, a handsome
Russian songstress, who claims to have
fought with the Cossack army. Her neck
was wreathed with several tiers of big pearls.
During the afternoon the hostess, who was
a commander of W.A.A.C.’s in France,
launched the surprise intimation that she
and her husband, Major James, are prepar-
ing to sail for England in April. They want
to see their youngest son, who has been
earning his crust in the Fog since he shed
his Anzac khald.
A remarkable old lady, Mrs. Kennett, died
at Essen don last week, aged 101. Seven
years and a little more ago she was one of
three sisters who counted up 268 years
among them. Mrs. Kennett, then 94, was
the oldest; the others, Mrs. Prior and Mrs.
Chalk, saw grandsons and great-grandsons
off to the war, but didn’t live to see many
of them return. The three came to S. Aus-
tralia in the middle ’forties; but Mrs. Ken-
nett had been in Victoria, for the past 60
years or more. Like her sisters, she had
quite good health until the last IS months
of life.
The Pierre Bellews' elder son, Jack, who
is on the Sun staff, has just astounded his
pals by getting engaged. His partner in
crime is the H. Iv. S. Wards’ second daugh-
ter, Verna. By the way, Jack's grand-
mother, Mrs. Hector Wilson—she is French
-—has recovered the two diamond necklaces
which disappeared with lief dressing-case
when she was travelling by train from Paris
to Italy. They were on the missing list
for nearly a year.
Jolimont-square, at the eastern elid of
Melbourne, facing the south side of Welling--
ton-parade, has been bought by the Adult
Deaf and Dumb Society for £25,000. With
adjoining land, this historic property was,
by permission of the N.S.W. Government,
bought for £5OO by C. J. Latrobe shorty-
after he came to Melbourne in 1839 as
superintendent of “the Port Phillip settle-
ment.” He erected on part of the area the
first Government House, which is still stand-
ing, though in a dilapidated condition. (Its
site is not included in the A. D. and D.
Society’s purchase.) Within the present
“square” (3.12 ft. by 2Soft.) is a garden with
a row of three two-storeyed houses on each
side. Five are of wood, and , are venerable
structures almost as old as the city; the
sixth is modern. The mouldy atmosphere
of the place is to be preserved—for a while,
at any rate.
Some,gossip from Adelaide: —
The National Council of Women had its fln-t
meeting for the year in the Town Hall, with the
president, Mrs. T. R. Bowman, in the chair, anJ
Dr. Marie Brown as the speaker. (She talked on
the care of mental defectives.) The Council, long
moribund here, is booming now, and plans to get
into touch with women’s organisations in the coun-
try, with an instructional course in household science
for country women as one of its objectives. By the
way, the year opened with one bit of bad luck—
Jessie Webb’s League of Nations lecture, which had
been well boomed, had to be postponed at the last
minute owing to her lecture engagements keeping
her longer than she had expected in the West.
From England comes news of the death of Mrs.
Walter Duffield. The oldest generation remembers
her as one of Adelaide’s best-known hostesses,
though she had made her home in the Cold Country
for some years. It is her son who is coming to
take charge of Canberra’s Solar Observatory, and
his younger brother is the Kenneth Duffield who
writes revue and musical comedy.
The W. A. Swans, holidaying in England, have
had a bait offered them in the shape of an English
vicarage. Canon Swan was staying in an Essex
village when the local parson fell ill, and he did
temporary duty so successfully that when the billet
had to be filled permanently the people clamored
for him to stay. But he has turned deaf ears io
the English wooing, though he has promised to stay
on till a new man is found for the job.

PROPERLY
Punters had a fairly happy time at Caul-
field last Saturday, in spite of forbidding weather.
Things went their way. The favorite, Tookarby,
seemed lucky to win the first race, and though
Heroic was not actually first favorite on figures for
the Alma Stakes, the great colt carried a larger
number of wagers than Vinstra. Indirectly, the
fine performance of Heroic spoke well for form in
the Oakleigh Plate, where the big son of Valais had
no chance in competition with older horses. A
popular reflection after Cairns had brought him home
ahead of Mercian King in the Alma Stakes (giving
from 291 b. to 341 b. to the other placed horses) was
that the chances of two-year-olds in Oakleigh Plates
are no longer worth considering. If Heroic could
make no show to speak of, no future youngster
is likely to do what Titan an! others did in the
misty past. Conditions have changed since 30
years ago. The seasoned sprinters are more slippery
than they were, and, seemingly, no two-year-old can
live with them.
Englefield scored a stylish win—-his third in suc-
cession—in the Woodcliff Handicap, and then The
Hawk had a Futurity success made easier for him
by the scratching of Claro. Maid of the Mist was
the only public fancy bar the Maorilander, but
the Maid apparently is not yet in her Spring con
dition. The Hawk, drawing away from Sonora and
Easingwold at the finish, gave onlookers an im-
pression that he might have won the Newmarket
almost as easily had he been left in that handicap.
Bronzillet, who ran a good race over the smaller
sticks a week earlier, won the steeplechase anyhow.
Then Blackadder took the Hawksburn Handicap
easily. The time —lmin. 14|sec. —hardly suggested
that Blackadder is up to Newmarket form, but the
dire defeat of Polytheist indicated that Eric Con-
nolly’s horse must be discarded for the Flemington
flutter, for which he has since been scratched.
Farr’s running was less conclusive, yet the failure
of the English horse to follow up his promising per-
formance in the Oakleigh was disappointing, to say
the least.
* * * *
With Claro under suspicion, and the
calendar warning one against nutting too much
faith in high weights, such as Easingwold, Sonora,
Whittier and even Braehead, it is reasonable to
look lower down the list for the Newmarket winner.
Una Carlos, Bardoleur and Blue Cross have at
least honest pretentions to carry good money. The
mare has certainly resumed her old habit of running
like a squib since she won the Standish on New
A ear’s Day; nevertheless the Standish performance
is unanswerable evidence of her ability to stick out
the straight six. On January 1, carrying 7st. 121 b.,
Uni ran the distance in lmin. 12Asec. Sonora
(9st. 91b.) and Blue Cross (Bst. 41b.) were not far
behind. They meet her next Saturday on 81b. and
101 b. better terms respectively, their recent gallops
have been encouraging, and on paper all three of
the Standish place-getters must have a chance. To
tip Blue Cross right out may be an impertinence,
seeing that the gelding is 10 years old, and that
the handicapper has dropped him 91b. since he
actually won the sprint in 1921. Miracles do
happen in racing, all the same. Blue Cross, at, the
present moment, may be as speedy and as quick off
the mark as ever he was. Taking AVhittier, Sonora,
Farr, Una Carlos, Bardoleur and Blue Cross as a
likely six, this page’s choice is ior the old fellow.
He’s an evergreen with a record for consistency.
The Australian Cup will probably be won easily
at the finish by something that can take advantage
of the extra quarter-mile to make the most of its
stamina. Berrinbo looked very likely to be It until the
hurdle-racer got into trouble on the track last
Saturday, and cut his legs a bit. At time of writing
the extent of the damage is doubtful, and it may be
that Berrinbo is a goner. Accarak is probably one
that will see the long journey right out, though
his third in the Melbourne Cup is not conclusive
evidence. Nor is Englefield sure to be there in the
final tussle. Clan Robert is perhaps more likely
to be dangerous. But unless El Dorado has gone
right off, he is likely to beat them all. And Desert
Gold’s relative ran well enough at Caulfield, where
the conditions didn’t suit him, to suggest that con-
dition will not be lacking on Tuesday.
* * * *
“Fax” ; As often as not, early backers of
Newmarket and Australian Cup doubles fail to
get a run with their selections. Even when they
have a leg in, their other choice, is very apt to be
withdrawn. The breakdown of Sister Olive, when
she was first favorite for last Australian Cup, left
many backers of the Newmarket winner lamenting.
This year the withdrawal of The Hawk from the
Newmarket, and of Rivoli and Bitalli from the
Cup, has brought sorrow to silver punters,
* * * *
Ex-Treasurer McPhairson, who is tripping
to Europe till September, or thereabouts, has not
made things any easier for his old chief, Lawson, by
suggesting that the Vic. betting-tax should be in-
creased. It now yields £150,000, apart from the
£14,600 screwed out of T. Rook and co. for license
fees. The impost must, in any case, be reviewed this
year, as the Act authorising it expires on .December
31. The present House has rejected the tote, but
machine-betting will be a live issue at the general
election.
There was a big crowd at Rosehill
(N.S.W.) when racing was renewed on that course
—the first meeting since the fire nearly a year ago.
Punters expressed favorable opinions of the improve-
ments, which cost £40,000, and Were fairly success-
ful in “pickin’ em,” four of the eight races being
won by favorites. But a lot of money- was lost on
Pixy Ring, third in the Dundas Handicap to Marcin-
elle" and Girton Girl, and on Murky Night in the
Rosehill Handicap, in which the elderly Carmray
rolled home from La Benos and Validolid. Murky
Night looks a good one, but his form at Rosehill,
as at Randwick on the previous Saturday, was very
bad. On each occasion he had a postage-stamp on
his back in a middle-distance event. He would
probably do better in mile Welters, with a strong
lad like Orrell or Battle atop instead of the small
boys who have been riding him. Girton Girl showed
a glimpse of the speed which distinguished her in
her two-year-old days, and should win presently
when the company is not too select.
* * * *
“The Deacon”: Benefix, Dan Seaton’s
Fortafix home, is a curiosity among Randwick
steeds. Discarding the niceties of the aristocrat,
he forages for himself, like any Weary Willie, in
the by-streets and lanes of the racing suburb.
After the morning’s work he crops the council’s
herbage till the 12 o’clock buzzer from a nearby
factory announces' that dinner is nigh. Then,
elevating his absurd stump of a tail, he heads for
home and cleans up everything in sight. Then
back to the garbage till the regular horses come
out for afternoon walking exercise; whereupon an-
other peculiarity exhibits itself. None of your
regular slugs for Benefix! Invariably he attaches
WOODFULL, the Vic. stonewaller, who has
had another good season.
himself to the prime crock of the period, and
sedately exercises alongside, minus rein or rope.
When Gloaming was available, he was invariably
selected by the Huck Finn of horsedom to accompany
him during the afternoon saunter, though Gloaming
looks the aristocrat he is, and Benefix is rather
like a Suffolk Punch.

“P. Pawnticket”: There is an English
filly called Alimony, by Son-in-Law out of Pop-the-
Question. Sydney once had a trotter by Journalist
—-Sensation; the owner, a genial soul, called it
Tripe. It never won a race, which shows that it
lived before its . time. Tripe seems to be very
successful to-day.
* * * *
“Country Ped”: While clerk of scales at
an unregistered course in the country, I had leisure
to meditate on the childish devices of some of the
mannikins. “Weigh me without the saddle, an’
that’ll make the corree’ weight.” was said three times.
Each time, on production of the saddle, a lead bag
had to be added. Another schemer tried to get
weighed while lightly resting one foot on the floor.
And a youth who was under the poundage sought—in-
effectually—to make it up by holding in his hand
and curiously examining the 1121 b. weight.
Memory sketch, Moore Park, Sydney.
When delegates to the Olympic Federation
met in Melbourne last week, they were told there
was only £BOOO in sight, including the Common-
wealth Government’s pro rata grant, and that the
tour would cost quite £350 a man. Therefore
they were obliged to modify their original design,
which was to send 40 Australians to Paris. The
team, as selected, consists of six track athletes,
six swimmers, two cyclists, two boxers and an
eight-oar crew, with its coach and cox. The athletes
are Carr, Honner, Winter, Austen (N.S.W.), Duigan
and Boyd (Vic.) ; the swimmers are Charlton, Henry,
Herald, Eve (N.S.W.), Beaurepaire and Stedman
(Vic.) ; while Dempsey (N.S.W.) and Ramsden (Vic.)
are the cyclists, and Sinclair (Q.) and Jones (Vic.)
the boxers. The crew will be Murray Bridge (S.A.)
or whoever beats it in the test race on the Port River
—Melbourne, the Westralians and the Old Launcesto-
nians all have hopes. Others who may go if suffi-
cient money comes in before April 6, when the team
is booked to leave Sydney, are Angelo (Vie.), wrest-
ler; Jorgenson (Vic.), weight-lifter; Grehan (Q.),
sprinter; Coppins (N.S.W.), cyclist; and Bull
(N.S.W.), sculler, in the order named. The omis-
sion of Brancourt, the giant Bankstown (N.S.W.)
heavyweight, is a surprise, and so is that of Bailey
(N.S.W.), the cross-country runner. Another objec-
tion is that there are too many swimmers. How-
ever, the women’s swimming associations are not
of that opinion. While the delegates were struggling
with their labors, they were cheered by a message
from Brisbane that the controllers of those vivacious
bodies would be obliged if eleven mermaids were in-
cluded in the team.

In the absence of Mina Wylie, Lily Robert-
son, of Sydney, won a treble —100yds. (lmin. 10
4-ssec.), 220yds. (3min. 6 4-ssee.) and 440yds.
(6min. 49 2-ssec.)—in the ladies’ championships at
Brisbane last week. The times were creditable, but
nothing out of the way, and it is evidefit that
present Australian form among the bobbed-haired
wearers of one-pieces is below that of the Americans.
Patterson was the hero of the tournament
which succeeded the Vic.-N. S. Wales tennis match at
Sydney'; he triumphed in the singles and (with Sehles-
inger) in the doubles. J. Willard fought out the
final of the singles and travelled very well for two
sets, the second of which he won. Then the tall
Victorian reached the top of his form, and in the
third and fourth sets it was 6 —2, 6-—O. Gerald had
his hardest tussle with Clemenger, who ran him co
five sets. In the doubles, moreover, Clemenger and
Baker defeated Anderson and Wertheim, but they
didn't capture a set from Patterson and Schlesinger
in the final. Schlesinger’s radiance was dimmed by
Peach, who beat him handily ; and Kalms didn’t
bother Patterson in the singles, although he and
Aubrey Sieler gave Patterson and Schlesinger a
great go in the doubles. In the ladies’ championship
Miss Lance had no trouble with Mrs. Molesworth
(Q.), whose tennis is evidently on the wane.
“Linesman”: Interviewed at Colombo regarding
Davis Cup prospects Norman Brookes said the Aus-
tralian team wouldn’t reach the challenge round. .
This means that in Brookes’s judgment we shall not
survive the match with the winner of the European
zone, which most expect to be France, but which
may be Spain. My opinion is that against either of
these countries Australia has an excellent chance of
capturing a majority of the rubbers. With Patterson
in form, as we have every right to expect, we can
hope that at least he and O’Hara AVood will win one
singles each and collar the doubles from any team
that crosses the Atlantic. The only man who looks
good enough to beat Patterson is Alonzo, the
Spaniard, though the big fellow might have some
trouble with Lacoste, should the Gauls get the verdict
on the other side. Brookes said pessimistically that
Patterson was below form, but this will surely be
remedied as he settles down to work. Also Wood’s
shoulder was alleged to be a handicap, though that
nimble voung man informed a friend of mine the
other day that he didn’t think his shoulder would
worrv him at all. Yet, even with Wood out, Patter-
son, assisted by Schlesinger or Kalms, would have to
be reckoned with. Patterson and Schlesinger for the
singles, and Patterson and Kalms in the doubles
should make the Europeans go for their lives. In
fact, assuming that these three are in good health
and condition, one backs them to hammer any com-
bination from Europe. The drawback about the
best of the Continental entrants is that they only
possess one outstanding star. For Davis Cup pur-
poses the rest are second-raters.
“Macmailus”: Tennis is on the up-grade
in Maoriland. Capital form has been shown of recent
months by Sims, Bartleet, D. G. France and E. D.
Andrews, and shrewd judges tip Andrews to become
a second Wilding. Though only 19, he possesses a
fine forehand drive, and is sound on backhand and
net play. Ferkins, another youngster, has alsb im-
pressed the critics as a volleyer of the O’Hara Wood
type. If these boys maintain their rate of improve-
ment they will be tough propositions in a year or
two for the in-and-out Australian cracks.
“J.H. (London) : I saw France donkey-
lick Scotland at the Stade Pershing in Paris on
New Year’s Day. Not a single Rugby prophet
either in Britain or France forecasted the result,
but, on the play, the Scotsmen were never in it.
Their backs, with the exception of Grade, their
skipper (the only great centre three-quarter in
British Rugby), were known to be weak, but they
had the strongest pack they have had for a decade,
and as France, up to now, has. always failed for-
ward, Scotland, it was thought, had a soft job on.
Instead, we saw the French forwards outplay the
Scottish eight at all points. Scottish forwards can
mix it with the best of them, but, for once, the
Frenchmen beat them at their own business. And
the French halves and three-quarters (notably
Jaurreguv, one of the greatest wings I’ve ever seen,
and Gallau, the new five-eighth) played the Maori-
land game as though to the manner born. The All
Blacks will have to be at their jbest when (or if)
they go to Paris next year.
-X- * * *
The Grime-Senimens fight at Melbourne
Stadium was as brief as a flapper’s affection. With-
in two minutes Semmens had been rocked to sleep,
the result of a right on the stummick and three
on the jaw. Bradley and Murray, at Sydney
Stadium, was not quite so one-sided, but after hav-
ing been mauled and roughed for five rounds—the
Queenslander doesn’t believe in 1 jazzing methods —
Murray surrendered.
.. * * *
“Trekle”: Every Melbourne newspaper
has pointed to Ponsford, who wasn’t played in
Sheffield Shield cricket till this time last year, as
an example of the blindness of thq Victorian selectors
to brilliant youngsters. These selectors, alleging that
the press is hostile to them, never give any reason
for their actions, nor do they defend themselves
locally, when attacked. But Matt Ellis, one of
them, writing in the English Cricketer, claims that
the trio “taught Ponsford his cricket.” He goes
on to say that “we chose him on two occasions,
thinking he would be in the team. Unfortunately,
three of the sub-committee of players left him out,
and we had to bear, the blame,” That statement
is pertinent and revealing, but the claim that “we
taught Ponsford his cricket” is absurd.
Victoria’s fourth and final win for the
season in Sheffield Shield matches took nearly a
week to work out, in intervals of the storms which
have disfigured all of Adelaide’s alleged summer.
One dav there was no play at all. Between the
showers" S.A. made 191 and 256, which just failed
to overtake Victoria’s opening 454. The left-hander
Pritchard, not out 73, followed on with 47, but
John Murray topped everybody on his side with a
hard-hit 91. When S.A. looked likely to save the
one-innings defeat, Grimmett got busy with 8 for
86, three of them being stumped. Ellis nad a great
match before and behind the wickets —his contri-
bution with the bat was a vigorous 94.
* * * *
“Kip”: Though time was the essence of
the contract, the cautious batsman would persist
in patting the pitch after every ball. The impatient
barracker by my side could stand it no longer.
“Cut it out,” he yelled; “this ain’t a butter-factory.”
* * * *
“Machete”: A point “Trekle” has over-
looked in his condemnation of covered wickets (B.
7/2/’24) is the injustice of the practice to bowlers
and fieldsmen. In these days of glassy surfaces
and unenterprising batsmen, the bowler’s job is hard
enough without being made harder by a wet ball
and "a greasy approach, both inimical to accuracy
and spin. Nor is it easy to catch or field a moist
ball when the foothold is slippery. The batsman’s
only handicap on these occasions is the slowing of
the pace of his shots on the sodden turf. The
curse predicted by Warner and others has already
come home to roost. There is hardly a batsman in
Australia to-day who can keep his end up on a
pitch even slightly affected by rain. In other days
men like Worrall, Graham and Percy McDonnell
made heaps of runs on sticky wickets.
* * * *
“Tren”: “Centurion” (B. 7/2/’24) seems
to doubt whether Crossland and Mold threw. W.
G. Grace once said that Crossland was the fastest
that ever played the game—-but he always threw.
For years English umpires refrained from penalising
throwers for fear of offending the captains and so
losing their jobs. Often, too, a man punished would
be moved to the other end, there to continue his
dirty work. Thus throwing, open and unashamed,
was" rampant. When Jim Phillips, «f Melbourne,
umpired Lancs, v. Notts in 1900, he no-balled Mold
immediately, and the express bowled only one over.
This surprised the county captains into action,
and at a now famous meeting they condemned Mold’s
delivery by 11 votes to 1. However, he threw on
unchecked until July, 1901, when he again met
Phillips, who no-balled him 16 times in 10 overs.
This was the end of Mold, and of throwing.

“Hobnobster”: The men on the station
were great eribbage players, and the game was the
main topic of conversation at the meal-table.
Finally the boss’s wife mildly rated the hands for
their inability to find any other subject of dis-
cussion. It was unfortunate that All Ping, the new
cook, should have regarded the lady’s remarks as
a complaint upon the sameness of ■ the dishes pro-
vided by him. “You get some more cook, boss,”
be demanded. “Missis say ‘Fifteen-two, brekfus.
fifteen-two, dinner, fifteen-two, tea, make her sick.’
I leave.” He did, too, sorely wounded in his
professional pride.
A DEAD-GAME SPORT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Admiral Sir Dudley de Chair, the newly-arrived
Governor of N. S. AVales, admitted a fondness tor
golf, yachting, cricket and horseracing, and also
recalled that he had played three-quarter at football
in his younger days. ‘He gives the impression,’
pronounces the Daily Telegraph, ‘of a man with
a thorough grasp of the things that count, an alert,
mind and a flair for sport.' ”
He’s knowledge, any amount,
Of little things that count;
His mind’s a bubbling fount
Of erudition,
Tact and discernment rare,
But, best of all, his flair
For sport proclaims de Chair
An acquisition.
Wften the Britannia’s decks
He trod, our present Ex.,
To learn his trade complex
He was a plugger
At every form of sport
To which cadets resort,
And deftly- played three-quart-
er back at Rugger.
Where cricket teams contest
He mingled with the rest,
.Slung yorkers in with zest,
And found it jolly
Balls on the off to flip
Between third man and slip,
And o’er the ropes to rip
The soft half-volley.
The way to steer a yacht
In races fast and hot,
He hasn’t yet forgot,
I’ll bet a fiver.
O’er golf links may he streak
Long ere his arm grows weak
With mashie or with cleek,
Mid-iron or driver.
Even when bookies yell
And ramps malodorous smell
’Tis odds this bluff old shell-
back’s no beginner.
As steady as a rock,
Where puzzled punters flock,
He’ll disregard the crock
And pick the winner.
With an abiding love
For games like those above,
What could we find a Gov.
But an all right ’un?
Admirals before we’ve had
And given them greeting glad,
But never such an Ad-
mirable Crichton!

It is hardly safe these times for a pro-
fessional singer to warble “The Last Itose
of Summer” on the Melbourne concert plat-
form. An audience gets annoyed by the
ancient ballad, and a homicidal lunatir
might start shooting. You see, Melbourne
has ceased to have a summer.
South Aus. has lost the services of E. R.
Darwin, who goes to Melbourne to lecture on
surveying, under Prof. Payne. The young
Crow-eater took his B.Sc. at Adelaide, and
since then has been engaged mainly on rail-
way surveys, including the East-West line.
He was also assistant to Cutting, the Yank
engineer who came to Australia to construct
the locks and weirs on the Murray.
The people who trace half our ills to defec-
tive teeth have had another sort of a win,
With a doctor (Argyle) as Chief Sec., tin
Vie. Inspector-General of Insane has been
able to give effect to a long-cherished wish t«
have a dentist appointed for metropolitan
asylums. Leslie Govett lias got the job.
Jones expects that better teeth will facili-
tate the recovery of patients who are not
hopeless, and mitigate the troubles of those
who have crossed the line.
Pennington, M.L.A., who has gone to be
Vic.’s leading man at the Empire Exhibi-
tion, knows that he is taking the risk of
losing his Kara Kara seat, especially if the
Liberals and Cockies dissolve partnership.
In a burst of candor at St. Arnaud he de-
scribed the Composite Cabinet as a “miss-
tire,” and mentioned that the reason his
friend Lawson was hanging on was because
he wanted to give something back for the
£BOOO the State had spent on his trip abroad.
“Skipper”: “Gylandah’s” par. (B.
20/12/’23) on one-armed handy men brings
to mind Captain Macleod, at present mana-
ger of Macleod’s Reward (W.A.). Loping
liis arm in France, he was fitted up with an
artificial flipper, and, wangling his way back
across the Channel, persuaded them to give
him a front-line job. He saw much heavy
fighting as a company commander, a bullet
on one occasion piercing his wooden arm.
On returning to the West he set 91ft pros-
pecting from Marble Bar with only a couple
of nigs, for companions. Sixty miles out
he located the little show which bears his
name, and later persuaded some Adelaide
men to put up the necessary cash to develop
it.
In whirling up and down the country
Half-Priminister Page finds occasion for a
little medical practice. Somewhere between
Grafton and Glen Innes (N.S.W.) recently
a car attached to his party met with an
accident, and Page had to render medical
aid to Missingham, M.L.A., who was trying
to carry on with a broken rib. But there
was another occasion which had no wit-
nesses. While taking a solitary walk Page
was stopped by a frantic child who inco-
herently spoke of a woman being ill. Before
he returned to the politicians and pressmen,
who were beginning to wonder what liadbe-
come of him, the Acting-Prime Minister had
helped to bring a little immigrant into the
Commonwealth.
“Centurion”: Chafifey, N. S. Wales Minis-
ter for Agriculture, announced the other day.
apropos of nothing in particular, that Britain
was taking up a “new industry”—the mak-
ing of lead pencils. I can remember when
it was hard to get a pencil that wasn t
British made. The centre of the industry
was John Ruskin’s town of Keswick, in the
Lakes District. Later on, blessed by Brit-
ish Freetrade, Austrian and German manu-
facturers captured the business, and America
a l so butted in, and the Cumberland plum-
bago—esteemed the best of its kind —fell into
disuse. To-day the district lives mainly on
tourists—largely people whom the protected
industries of other countries have supplied
with the means to travel.
Ramsay Macdonald and his Cabinet have
slid into the official uniform of Ministers oi
the Crowni wdthout provoking a riot amoiis
their followers. It was not quite so with
Andrew Fisher in Australia. When that
plain Scot w r as called upon to form a Cabi-
net his shiny hat and frock-coat received a
vote of censure from several followers, while
one of the Reds turned agonised eyes to
Heaven and said: “My God, that I should
live to see this!” Fisher, who overheard
the comment in the party room, was visibly
disturbed, but, recovering, he raised a laup
by going over to the critic, patting him 0"
the shoulder, and saying, in a tone of com
miseration, “Don’t ye worrit. Wulhe.

Tivoli Musgrove Celebrity Vaudeville
In “The Man in Dress Clothes,” which in-
troduced Seymour Hicks to Australia at
Melbourne Palace, freshness in the style of
the comedy goes for mucll. It is a Hicks
adaptation of a very French story, the dia-
logue so bright as to be sometimes brilliant,
the mingling of humor with sentimentality
Parisianly adroit. Subtleties of characteri-
sation will be more deeply appreciated when
the company has suited its tones to a larger
theatre than seemingly housed the comedy
in London, and Hicks himself has slowed
down his utterance. Lucien’s financial crash
accounts for the title of the piece. Aston-
ished to find himself in the broker’s hands,
stripped of practically everything save the
clothes he stands in, he elects to stand in
his dress suit, for dining-out purposes. Mean-
while the beautiful wife he dotes upon sup-
poses that he’s a profligate waster, with still
a lot of money to burn on trumpery altars,
and she seriously asks him for her liberty
(to marry again) when she supposes him to
be once more changing his bachelor diggings.
The relations between the silently adoring
husband and the misunderstanding wife to
whom he has given 20 million francs for a
wedding dot are theatrically false. Their
tardy arrival at a reconciliation is a matter
of course. Strained sentimentality has to do
duty for pathos. Nevertheless the art of the
actor makes the artificiality of the story as
convincing as need be. The hero, who is but
a witty spendthrift, endears himself to his
audience. Besides, he has a capitally
humorous pal to make the best of him, and
the combination of hard-ups, engaged in try-
ing to raise a dinner at a restaurant, is as
funny as the farce is long.
* * * *
As a light comedian who can put tears
into his voice and force into his persuasive-
ness, Seymour Hicks is top of his class. In
fact, he seems to occupy a class by himself.
His first appearance must have been marred
in a measure by the sudden illness of Miss
Barbara Hoffe, who was to have played the
wife. All in a hurry Mrs. Hicks (Ellaline
Terriss) took the sick lady’s place; and,
although Miss Terriss has a pretty face and
a sweet voice, she was not able to realise the
MELBOURNE TIVOLI.
Fireman Rob Wilton, who has been in the
business since fires first became popular,
dashes off to a conflagration and forgets
to bring the fire-engine.
character at short notice. Her manner
was scholastic and her appearance much too
matronly. Her goodness was as glaring as
the virtue of a church district-visitor. She
exuded a gentleness utterly at variance with
her supposed desire to chuck Lucien and
marry another fellow. Frederick Lloyd, a
newcomer, is a cheery partner of Lucien’s
impecuniosity, and Joan Kingdon, also a
new arrival, will soon identify her young self
with the part of a giddy girl, called Foxtrot,
who, having attached herself to the squan-
derer in his last hours of seeming wealth, on
learning that he is “broke to the wide” pro-
poses to refund some of the gold she never
earned. ' Foxtrot is a lamentably naughty
girl with a heart that can feel for the nice
gentleman who kisses the back of her hand
whilst paying her solid compliments in cash.
Frank Dunn plays valet, and Frank Haw-
thorn is chief among a number of valuable
character sketchers. The restaurant scene
of the second act is the livest thing of its
type that Melbourne has experienced, and the
general furnishings, fixings and dressing of
the show are a further aid to this country's
civilisation.
£ * * if
“Othello” will curse hi& folly for yet an-
other week at Melbourne King’s.. He makes
life worth while for mummers concerned
in Oscar Asche’s full-blooded entertainment.
Greenaway, as Cassio, can warmly congratu-
late himself on not having put an enemy
into his mouth to -steal away his youthful
figure, and Roderigo by this time must have
learned the folly of putting money in one’s
purse to oblige a spieler whose promises are
as piecrust and whose devious paths of un-
pleasantness lead only to the grave. The
good men of Venice and Cyprus get fine fat
lines to roll around their tongues, and Oscar
Asche can confidently hope that if people
speak of him as they found him in this in-
stance they will cheerfully admit that he
did the State some service while loving
Shakspeare not unwisely nor too well.
“Ambrose Applejolin's Adventure” is
being repeated for a week at Melbourne
Majesty’s, and the four disguised crooks are
again starting the plants which put Ambrose
into a piratical frame of mind. Lawrence
Grossmith is a lusty ruffian in all essen-
tials—except that his lily-white knees recall
a lady of the chorus. Dorothy Seacombe
now answers to the caressing murmur of
“Pop-ay!” by the principal man, and duly
sacrifices her girlish sweetness, while taking
the Marcel wave out of her elocution, as it
were, to become a bonnie boy on the Apple-
jack staff. The only other notable change
is the apparition of Leslie Victor as the pre-
tended disciple of Zoroaster, who sees the
signs of the zodiac when the buccaneer
buries a knife in his skimpy frame. Victor
is pretty good in his way, but is not meaty
enough as the Chinese bos’n to furnish a
gory homicidal spectacle. After dealing with
the fat and juicy Mongol of the previous
season, at the King’s, Grossmith must feei
as if he is driving a hatpin into a sardihe.
The assertion that “Little Nellie Kelly” is
dancing her way still further into Mel-
bourne’s heart at the Princess’s wall hold
good until further notice. There is no slack-
ening of the endeavor in the 10th week.
Dancing is seemingly the delight of every-
body concerned in Hugh Ward’s ornate pro-
duction. . Or nearly everybody. Ireland
Cutter is not conspicuously energetic. lie
doesn’t look like a plump marauder who
would go creeping behind an unsuspecting
citizen m order to rob him of a day’s work
or steal a new idea from him. Cutter plays
exactly the same old Gussie he played in the
beginning, and his smile resembles the laws
of the Medes and -Persians which altereth
not. Though, to be sure, there never was
any occasion for the M.’s and P.’s to blow
about it.
“Sally” has nearly completed her tally at
Melbourne Royal. She will continue her
artless impersonation of Madame Lookerovah
until March 7, and next night Miss Gertrude
Elliott copies to Melbourne as Bluebeard’s
Eighth Wife.
*
A gypsy romance, which is caravanned
over some of the bleakest parts of Scotland,
is Melbourne Majestic’s chief claim to atten-
tion this week. The film is called “The
Romany,” and if the plot is inferior the
trimmings are good, one feature being a fine
filming of a sheep-dog trial. “The Barri-
cade,” which follows on, -whisks the spec-
tator back to Noo Yoik, where we learn
once more how the gulf is bridged between
an East Side lad and a society belle. Hoyt's
have hired a typhoon to wreck the penulti-
mate act of “Thundering Dawn,” another
epic of the drink-sodden hero restored to
respectability by the usual girl. Katherine
Macdonald picks up a casual husband in
the other half of the programme, and it turns
out a complete success, notwithstanding that
she was driven to grab the first likely thing
offering by the brutal attentions of Prince
Ferdinand of Dementia, one of the worst
rips the films have ever foiled. “Re-
fuge is the title of the tale. By wearing
horn spectacles and a little flat hat, Tom
• conce als his capacity for violence
ir, Soft Boiled,” at the Melba. “The Truth
About Wives” is at the Britannia, where
also the restless phantom of Clyde Cook has
a mirthful career in “The Cyclist.”

Oscar Asche writes :
In answer to the anonymous “Orb” (B. 21/2/’24)
the reason why I do not give the lie direct to the
critic of the Argus for stating that I speak most of
my address with my back entirely turned to the
Duke is because the critic in this case was right.
Since the Sydney production of “Othello’' 1 hive
slightly altered my conception of this scehe, aiid hly
position and bearing .towards the Ulike; Senators
and Brabant io. I do now, which 1 did not do in
“DE LUXE ANNIE." AT SYDNEY
ROYAL
Cyrus Monroe (Maurice Dudley) is scared

(Frank Harvcy. )
Sydney, speak most of my address facing my accuser
and the majority of the Senators. It is merely a
question of what is best from a stage-management
point of view, and, after all, I know that I am
the best judge of that. I think it is Hall Caine
who says that “critics are mostly failures Wallowing
in the backwash of their own incompetence.”
After all, the stage-manager seems to have
created his own difficulty by placing the
Doge full facing the audience, instead of
at right angles, or nearly so. As the Doge
is, Mr. Asche makes the best of a difficult
situation.
A portion of Melbourne's populace re-
mains very loyal to the free entertain-
ment provided by Dr. Price at the Town
Hall. His mid-day organ recitals attract
the most genuinely musical audiences the
Town Hall ever shelters. Twice a week
he draws impressive melody from the in-
strument, and a section of his shifting audi-
ence appears to be the same at every recital.
He must have _ done larger things towards
forming a public taste for high-class music
than any other individual performer, and can
consider himself more valuable than a good
gramophone record as a worker in the
vineyard of Art. Yet nobody testifies to
the city organist’s elevating influence. He’s
an overlooked boon, as far as the press is
concerned. _ There are no bouquets of praise
for the artist who cannot charge for admis-
sion.
** * *
A programme with a hundred items in it:
Miss A. R. Dent hangs 93 water-colors at the
Melbourne Athenaeum, and not one is better than
a potboiler. But she shows promise of doing greater
things in oils. The study of a kilted warrior, whose
rather small hands are fingering a claymore, is well
painted; and the picture of a beefy professor in
the millinery of his trade will warm the heart
of the academician. Two red-haired examples of the
artist’s sex are less to be blamed than the three
mournful figures bent over a game of draughts—
Miss Dent has discovered the interesting fact that
people playing draughts always look their dullest.
But the best of the canvases is the profile of a boy
whose naturalness is striking after the somewhat
posturing self-consciousness of various other models.
A thin lady in Russian costume is the inspiration ot
a morbid illustration in pastels. Some excellent
hand-made pottery by Harold Swanson is tacked on
to the show, and affords more than its share of
compensation for the climb to the gallery.
:Je sis jjs
“Mis’ Nell o’ New Orleans” is still filling
Sydney Cri. with the seductive atmosphere
of Yankeeland’s warm south and the plea-
sant hum of plantation melodies. On Satur-
day week the Vanbrugh-Boucieault combina-
tion will switch off the Louisiana lass and
switch on “The Second Mrs. Tanqueray.”
** % *
At Sydney Royal “De Luxe Annie” has
two more nights to grip and thrill. Then
My Lady’s Dress” comes out of the ward-
robe, and nothing fits Emelie Polini more
admirably than this ravishing piece of rai-
ment.
“Sybil,” at Her Majesty’s. Sydney, re-
mains a whirl of gladness, a glitter of color
a madrigal of melody. Also, the rich furs
and splendid costumes show no signs of wear
and tear, and the falling snow and an occa-
sional reference to the disadvantages of get-
ting a free ticket to Siberia are the only
reminders of the warts on the country in
which all these gorgeous creatures are dis-
porting themselves.
Leap Ybat may have nothing to do with
it, but the fact remains that the Sydney
Tivoli bill nowadays is a succession of love
lyrics. The big hit of the moment is Harry
Claff, a well-nourished “Arabian Knight"
clothed in spangles, who has a host of jokes
that have not the perfume of yesterday’s
prawns. The excellent violin work of Wind-
sor and Edgar continue to brighten Alec
Kelleway's turn; Jen Latona mixes agree-
able song and patter; and the “Royal
Eleven” little girls make a good showing in
statue and tumbling tricks. Will Hay is
just shifting his school-books to make room
for the ever-bright Julian Rose.
A dovelike damsel with League of Nations
yearnings is Jane Mercer, who trips
gently through “ A Chapter in Her Life” at
Hoyt’s (Sydney). As a self-appointed arbi-
ter she reconciles all the conflicting factions
of a disordered household. “The Bad Man”
is putting the acid-test on the golden rule
at the same house; but, crooked as he is,
the girls say he is not tt patch upon the
male escort who buys his fluffy partner six
pennyworth of boiled lollies when a three-
an’-sixp’ny box of chocs, was expected. The
dainty Lyceum usherettes have disappeared
for awhile, the MethodieS having billeted
themselves in the big Pitt-street lidjise for
their once-a-year conference. The Empress
has let loose “The Hero,” one quarter drivel
and 75 per cent, juggling with the charac-
ters. “The Town that. Forgot God” is at
the same theatre —and lots of others; most
screen townships suffer from the same lapse
of memory. In the Empress’s case an escape
of water washes the non-pewholders to
Eternity, only two emerging to tell the
tale. “The Cheat,” at the Globe, is. an ex-
pensive doll-wife who cultivates admirers in
lien of housemaid’s knee. At the Crystal
Palace “The White Flower” is in full
bloom, and four times daily a conscience-
pricked cleric promenades his skeleton in the
cupboard to the accompaniment of sniffles
from the sentimental.

A Sydney art note:—
The landscapes in oils which J. Muir Auld has
hung in Horderns’ Gallery are of interest chiefly
because they show how the artist iB acquiring a
freedom and breadth that were only hinted at in
his earlier work. There are between 00 and 00
canvases on view, mostly small, and, though Very un-
even, they are honestly chosen subjects tickled with sin-
cerity. There is no frill or trickery about Mtiir
“Little nellie kelly,” AT MEL-
BOURNE PRINCESS’S.
Police-Captain John Kelly (Mark Daly) un-
screws his baton and has a “spot,” while
millionaire Jack Lloyd (Eric Masters)
wooes Nellie Kelly (Mamie Watson).
Auld; he is one of the plodders in paint, and he
has his feet planted fairly on the ground. Yet he is
not lacking in versatility or adventure, and in this
show he hammers that fact home with such diverse
essays as “Afternoon Glow,” “A Sunny Corner,"
“Manly from the Harbor-side,” “The Track to the
Sea,” “Showery Weather” and “The Gale.” There
is sound work in them all.
Adelaide shows now vary from the saucy
to the solemn—Ada Reeve in pantomime at
the Royal, and Allan Wilkie giving quick-
change Shakspeare at the Prince of Wales.
Hunter-Watts has had the big chances
so far, her _ double of mother and daughter
in “Winter’s Tale” being a fine piece of
work. The “Shrew,” taken briskly as the
frank farce it is, was another success. The
weather for outdoor shows is simply hor-
rible. In pictures, Clara Kimball Young,
at Wondergraph, shows the Forbes-Robert-
son lady how to play “Enter, Madam,” and
at West’s Ethel Clayton leaves no doubt
that a woman can Love Twice —period un-
specified ; but apparently it’s true of either
a lifetime or an evening.

“0.K.” : Ellaline Terriss talks of arrang-
ing for the stage debut in Australia
of daughter Betty. At one time or
other a good many daughters of visit-
ing British actors fiave had their bap-
tism of limelight on the Australian stage. In
the very long ago Charles Warner’s chick
made what was said to bo her first appear-
ance as an actress at Melb. Royal. She
was painfully nervous,..and almost inaudible.
Charles Cartwright’s daughter, Edith Morley,
was the crudest of novices, though as pretty
as a picture, when her father staged her as
heroine of “A Marriage of Convenience” at
Melb. Bijou, under Harry Rickards’s man-
agement. Cicely Courtneidge was nine years
old when the dad gave her one of the young
fairy parts in “Midsummer Night’s Dream,”
the beautiful show which he staged for
George Musgrove at Melbourne Princess’s.
Again, when Courtneidge brought “The Man
from Toronto” to Australia, his younger
daughter, Rosaline, though not quite strange
to the business, made a first appearance in
any part worth mentioning.
“Runic” : The operas suggested by “Abbot
Park” for inclusion in the Melba repertoire
(B. 14/2/’24) are almost as stereotyped as
the ones he condemns. “Lohengrin” is cer-
tainly an improvement on the Verdi welter,
but why choose “Lohengrin” when “The
Ring” is available? “The Ring” has not
been played in Australia for over a decade.
One of the two Puccini operas, both familiar,
might have given place to either “The Girl
of the Golden West” or “The Little Bird,”
his two most recent productions, while very
few tears would have been shed if Mas-
cagni’s barrel-organ masterpiece had been
sacrificed for such a thing as Debussy s
“Pelleas et Melisande” or the same com-
poser’s “L’Enfant Prodigue.”
“F.L.H.” : Among the array of conductors,
directors and stage-managers engaged for the
J.C.W.-Melba opera season is Frank St.
Leger, who is to wave the baton at some of
the productions. He conducted “Faust” in
London for Melba, and has also been with
the Chicago Opera Co. Melbourne first saw
him as a director when he guided the orches-
tra for dancer Maud Allan and the Clicrniav-
skys. In later concerts with the Russians
and other artists St. Leger proved himself
an uncommonly good accompanist.
“Santander”: A. E. Greenaway’s suavity
as an actor has never been better shown
than in his impersonation of Cassio in
“Othello.” In the original Oscar Asche
production I remember G. Iv. Souper dipping
his nose in a stoup of liquor and assuming
a boisterousness that seemed to make him all
legs and gesticulation. Greenaway’s Cassio
is a gallant with a restless conscience; his
falling away from grace is presented as a
gentlemanly yielding to a temptation that
never looks like turning him into a hog.
Next to Asche himself, Greenaway is about
the most competent of the native-born in
Shakspearean plays. I cannot recall any-
thing special he has done in ordinary drama,
but one or two of his Shakspearean roles
stand up vividly in the memory for some
quality of charm or intelligence that is hard
to define. His Cassius in Bert Bailey’s
production of “Julius Caesar” and his Jac-
ques in “As You Like It” were representa-
tions of the men one thought Cassius and
Jacques ought to be.
“M.E.”: Tell “ Jamwood” (B. 21/2/’24)
that Frances Starr is not Muriel Starr’s
sister. It is a fact that Muriel was in her
early twenties when she arrived here, but she
was no novice, having gone on the stage at
five. She was 26 when Ellen Terry saw
her play in “Madame X.,” a performance
which Ellen described as “wonderful.”
“Auck”: “T.P.” (B. 17/l/’24) recalls
Juliet Wray. Melbourne will shortly have
a chance to see whether her daughter, Bet-
tina Sharman, has inherited any of the
.talent which charmed it in the ’nineties.
Bettina is a handsome blonde, with a ser-
viceable voice, pleasant in both speech and
song. Given the opportunity of acquiring
experience, she should make good.
“Orb”: After a long spell off stage Ross-
lyn Vayne has made her reappearance as
Bianca in Oscar Asche’s Melbourne produc-
tion of “Othello.” Miss Vayne, a spirited
actress, made her bow in Australia in “Sweet
Kitty Bellairs” at Melbourne Princess’s in
April, ’O9. She gave a lively performance
in that Belasco outbreak, and has done good
mumming iince, notably with Ethel Irving.
Her husband, Arthur Greenaway, plays Cas-
sio in “Othello.”
“0.K.” surveys some castles in Spain:—
There is pathos in the foolishness of a circular
issued by “The Community Theatre Association of
Victoria,” with the dream-object of establishing in
CLEARING UP A MYSTERY.
“‘Rocked in cradle of deep’—what do it mean, William John, do
’ee know?”
“O’ coorse. It do mean rope broke when cage was ha’f-way
down shaaft.”
Melbourne “a permanent self-supporting theatre,
thoroughly progressive in spirit, for the common use,
pleasure, education and artistic recreation of the
community.” The optimistic chairman, hon. treasurer
and organising secretary expect to enrol 5000 sub-
scribers at a guinea, and thereby “place the
whole proposition on a sound commercial basis and
embark on the production of plays,” which plays
are to be “characterised by artistic merit, but not
produced merely for their box-office value, although
presented with the highest possible standard of
mounting and acting.” Needless to mention that '*a
further object will be to encourage the development
and production of approved Australian drama,” the
promoters of this scheme being presumably dramatists
looking for a chance to get their own artistically
meritorious plays staged. One aim and object is
“to establish a company of professional artists for
the adequate production of such plays; this company
to be backed by an organised audience of members
of the association.” But the pathos of this blather-
skiting is not in the egotism of people who propose
to establish a permanent, “self-supporting” progres-
sive theatre, as well as a company of professional
artists with an “organised audience” at their backs,
on a capital of £5OOO. It is in the simplicity of
people who expect their aims and objects to ensure
a subscription of 5000 subscribers at a guinea each
per annum —5000 subscribers who will “join in
sharing the pleasure and inspiration that come from
seeing great plays greatly acted and finely produced.”
Not until 5000 eager citizens have weighed in with
their guineas will “the best artists, managers, musi-
cians and artisans” be booked under a co-operative
plan, leaving the sordid commercial managements of
J.C.W. and Hugh Ward to struggle with only second-
best human material in all departments.
“Nelbur”: Jimmy Sullivan, who directed
Annette Ivellerman in her Maoriland pitcher,
“Shona of the South Seas,” is experiencing
trouble in marketing the thing. Several
exhibiting firms in the U.S.A. were
approached with offers to sell the
American rights, but they refused to pay
Sullivan’s price. Now it is reported that
“Shona” is to be screened at ’Frisco in
conjunction with Annette’s vaudeville
act. A Christchurch syndicate put up
the cash for the venture, and some
of the shareholders are feeling peevish.
I saw a trial spin of the film last
year; it was then called “The Darling of
the Deep.” The under-water scenes photo-
graphed at Nelson were good, and some of
the scenery was miles ahead of the average
landscape in American flicks. But the story
was crude and, barring Robert Purdie and
Jack Raymond, the acting was not up to
much. This may account for the Yanks not
biting. Still, story and acting were both
superior to the U.S. average, which is atro-
cious, and the chances are that the film
has cannoned against the boycott which,
according to Oswald Stoll, has been readied
up for British producers trying to break
into the American market.
“Hamfat”: An Australian actor, now
doing well overseas, will always remember
with humiliation his experience with a stage
dog. The animal
had been secured
for a walking part
in a play in which
the heroine was
held captive, com-
forted only by the
presence of her
faithful hound, in
a solitary house
surrounded by pri-
son-like walls.
The mummer now
expatriated was
the hero. At re-
hearsal he and the
dog got on mod-
erately amicable
terms, but the
necessity of having
a full-dress re-
hearsal of thgir
business was over-
looked. So when
the noble animal
saw a man in
strange clothing
and make-up clam-
bering over a w r all
he barked furi-
ous 1 y, reasoning
doubtless, that no
person whose in-
tentions were
honest or honor-
able would come in
like that. Tow-
ser’s attitude was
so threatening that
the actor hesitated
on his stony perch,
the wall mean-
while swaying pre-
cariously. Hoping
that the tyke
would recognise
him at close quar-
ters, he dropped in
the danger-zone.
Followed a melee
that was perfectly
thrilling. Then
the hero fled for
the wings -with
Towser well attached to the seat of his pants,
while the management dropped the curtain
and Towser’s teeth were drawn.
“Te Pana”: The Maoriland Government
cannot be accused of refusing assistance to
motion-pitcher producers. When Beaumont
Smith shot scenes at Rotorua for one of
his films he had the Tourist Bureau at his
elbow pointing out suitable “locations.” Rud
Hayward, in filming “My Lady of the Cave,”
was helped along by Government officials in
the B'ay of Plenty. Annette Kellerman had
the free use of the State yacht Ilinemoa for
scenes in “Shona of the South Seas.” And
when Douglas Fairbanks threatened to de-
scend on M.L. and make a Bully Hayes film
his representative was motored by the Tour-
ist Department to the scenes of Bully’s
more or less fabulous exploits. Fairbanks
evidently changed his mind. A thumping
tax on U.S. films might induce him to change
it again.
“Tantalus”: “Gnarek” (B. 14/2/’24)
might have been kind enough to say that
while the London critics slated “Bantam,
V.c.” they referred to Dorothy Brunton as
its one bright feature. ‘‘The Soldier
was little better than “Bantam, V.C.”; by
seme miracle it ran six months, but the end
was in sight before Miss Brunton joined
the co. One reason why Australia has not
provided London with musical-comedy stars
is that there the theatrical market is over-
stocked with this line of goods; here it is
under-stocked.
“Thur” : “Gnarek” (B. 14/2/’24) asserts
that no Australian has reached the front
rank in musical comedy where the Cockney
lives and has his decadent beer. What about
Carrie Moore, who created the leading part
in “The Dairymaids” at the Apollo, and also
had imxmrtant roles in “The, Cingalee, - ’
“Tom Jones,” “The Girl from Kay’s” and
“The Persian Princess”? On her return
to play lead in the original production here
of “The Merry Widow” Carrie had lost most
of her voice and much of the vivacity which
distinguished her as a kid. She was a de-
lightful Maid Marion at 16, and indisputably
a London star for years.
From a London first-nighter:—
The Ueandean syndicate, which has produced a
series of high-class works at the Ambassadors’, St.
Martin’s and other London theatres, is offering a
prize of £lOO for a three- or four-act play deal
ing with present-day life and character. Australians
and Maorilanders are eligible, provided their efforts
have never been published or performed by profes-
sionals for a Adit of more than a week.
The long London season of “Tons of Money” is
coming to an end at last. Its successor is to be
an American farce entitled “It Pays to Advertise."
“Tons of Money” has turned in a profit oi close on
£200,000, yet a dozen managers rejected it as
hopeless.
Revjie is hot. played out by any means, but it
has to be bright, witty and topical. All the critics
.are agreed that Dion Titheradge’s “Puppets,” which
has had an enthusiastic welcome at the Vaudeville,
fulfils all requirements. Unlike most revues, "Pup-
pets” has only one author and one composer.
Dion, who was born at Melbourne and is not yet 35,
has done all the dialogues and the lyrics;
Ivor Novello (just turned 31) supplied the music.
Binnie Hale and Stanley Lupino have leading parts.
“Nella” from another angle:—
Melba and Asche (B. 14/2/’24) have been treated
just as any other public characters are treated.
Quite apart from their artistic qualifications they
both possess the showman’s flair for publicity, and
their, utteraftes make them a fair target for criticism
by newspaper readers, although the papers them-
selves mostly; ‘hand out marmalade. Melba is about
the biggest thing we Australians have done (in the
Carlylean phrase), and we are proud of her artistic
pedestal. But the average Australian cannot take
kindly to leg-p,ulling. When Harry Lauder smelt the
gumleaves with rapture two days before he saw the
epast, we laughed. But when Melba slops over
about her “dear Australia” we are apt to recall
that she is equally gushful when she gets back to
“good old London” or “dear N’Yoick” or expensive
Paris. As to Asche, his extraordinary remarks on
various subjects, from Uncle Tom’s Cabin to Othello’s
make-up, have earned him just criticism, but, that
has nothing to do with his ability on the stage.
Reckless talkers must expect a hard word now and
then. Even William Morris Hughes got the bird—
and the egg, too.
Bernard Halle writes: —
“Topee” (B. 7/2/’24) conveys a mischievously
wrong impression when he says that Lady Halle’s
jealousy of Marian Burton shortened the Halle tour.
My father and stepmother had two seasons at the
Centenary Hall, Sydney. The second certainly was
a financial frost. Without their consent, Marian
Burton was engaged for this season, although the
company already had a singer, Mile Fillinger. For
reasons that need not be gone into now, my father
would not play Miss Burton’s accompaniments. As
for certain incidents that led to trouble during the
tour, it is sufficient to say that my father received
£l5OO compensation from the London directors of
the enterprise.
“Cheezo”: Few mummers will shed a tear
over the passing of the Majestic Theatre,
Goulburn (N.S.W.). After a hilarious
career it has been deregistered. It was built
right alongside the railway, and loco, whistles
could be depended upon to vent an ear-
splitting screech in the middle of any tick-
lish piece of dialogue, on the clear under-
standing of which the sense of the whole
depended, and it has witnessed more failures
perhaps than any other show-place in the
continent.
“Thersites”: Bernard Shaw’s “Saint
Joan,” which lasts four hours (B. 21/2/’24),
reminds me of old times. A four hours’
show was so common in the ’eighties that
playgoers felt they were getting light weight
if they were let out much before midnight.
“The Silver King” began its first night at
Melb. Royal on Oct. 27, ’B3, at 7.45 p ; m.,
and didn’t ring down till Sunday morning.
But, then, it had four intervals, and the vesti-
bule was lined with bars. Nowadays we get
a three-act farce which plays about 90
minutes; but with Saharan intervals and
late-starting overtures it is kept going till
10.40 or thereaway. What about “Othello"
followed by a farce, all for a bob, and with
free programmes? I’ve seen that.
ALL IN THE GAME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Jiggs disliked Biggs’s acting very much
And couldn’t stand the man. He showed his bias ;
His notices had a malicious touch.
Biggs laughing said, “These things are sent to try
us!”
“I’m honest in my views,” the scribe averred,
And always honestly gave Biggs “the bird.”
Whatever part he played, the mummer knew
From Jiggs he’d always get the same old roasting;
But Biggs stuck to his job, just “smilin’ through”—
You never heard him of his talent boasting.
And, curious to state, the slated pro.
Is quite an artist, as playgoers know.
But life is short; and so there came a day
When it was proved anew that Art is longer.
The critic lost his billet, strange to say,
Just when his notices of Biggs grew stronger
In scorn and contumelious abuse.
Jiggs left the paper, growling “What’s the use?”
Then —irony of fate—a job he took
Biggs’s managers, their plays to write up
In broadcast press parts; Though fhe Show was crook,
It was his biz to swear that it \iat quite up
To the high-water mark of all the hits
That ever had been cheered by gods and pits.
And Biggs? Well, what of him? You may have
, guessed.
No more his erstwhile censor cuts his capers.
By Jiggs the wondrous art of Biggs is stressed —
• It has to be —in all the leading papers.
And Biggs smiles at his sudden rise to fame ;
He knows, wise man, that it’s all in the game.

Radio Research
Research is a vital factor in any
industry; in the Wireless industry
it is absolutely essential.
The utility of patents lies in being able, not only
to apply them to the solution of particular pro-
blems, but by means of research to improve and
extend their application to newer fields of
endeavor and enterprise.
Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited
disburses the sum of £7OOO per annum in main-
taining a radio engineering research staff con-
stantly engaged in seeking improved and more
economic methods for the advancement of Wire-
less communication. By so doing the Company
assists in developing the ingenuity and research
talent of Australian engineers in the wider
application of the science of radio.
Last year the Company sent abroad four Austra-
lian Radio Engineers, members of the Staff, to
study the latest developments in all phases of
wireless, but more especially trans-ocean com-
munication and radio broadcasting.

An Air of Distinction.
(By “PILOX.”)
YE gods, she’s handsome! What a
stunner!”
These were among the explana-
tions uttered by the staff of Goodby and
.Sons when Mabel Mackay, the new clerk,
made her first appearance in the office. All
eyes were riveted on her. And when Miss
Mackay took her seat at the desk lately
vacated by Miss Johnson, who had left to
get married, more than one of the staff specu-
. ]ated as . t 0 long it would be before Miss
Mackay vacated it for the altar.
As is usual in firms where there is a large
staff of women, some of the girls generously
admired Miss Mackay; others envied her.
but there were others who could not quite
make up their minds about her. She cer-
tainly was attractive, they argued, and on
the whole distinctive-looking. But, as
Myra Black remarked, she hadn’t a feature
to her face. Her complexion was good, and
her hair always well groomed; otherwise
she had no beauty to boast about. Before
long, however, even the girls who criticised
her began to admire and to like her. There
was something irresistible about her. Mr.
Clarence Goodby, a son of the firm, evidently
thought so. From the first he was attracted
by her, but whether he liked her as a friend
or something mor e the staff was unable to
say.
Mr. Clarence, as he was known to them,
was one of those gentle, kindly young men
whose sole wish seemed to be to give plea-
sure to others. Mabel was, of course, flat-
tered by and enjoyed his attentions. She
was not a girl who made many friends, and
in her lonely bed-sittingroom at the board-
ing-house she loved to dwell on what the
good-looking son of the firm had said to her
at the firm’s concert the other evening, or
at the dance the girls had organised for the
Girls’ Itealm Guild Fund. She knew that he
admired her, but no word of love had been
spoken between them. She must look her
best at the firm’s annual dance, now only
three weeks off.
* * * *
Goodby and Sons’ dance was always one
of the smartest of the season. Not only the
employees but the principals and their wives
and friends attended. Among others Mabel
was introduced to a Miss Jackson, the
daughter of a university professor, and was
chatting with her when Mr. Clarence Good-
by came to claim her for a dance. Mabel
hadn’t a partner for that dance, and as her
eyes followed the pair she thought how weil
they looked together. What beautiful fea-
tures and pretty eyes Miss Jackson had. A
tinge of jealousy crossed her mind, but she
quickly checked it. Mabel had the next
dance with Mr. Clarence, and thoroughly
enjoyed it.
Later in the evening Mabel found herself
again beside Miss Jackson. “Don’t you
think Mr. Clarence Goodby is handsome?”
she asked Mabel.
“Yes, and good, too,” replied Mabel.
“We re engaged, you know.”
“I hadn’t known ; but I must congratulate
you.”
“Oh, we’re not formally engaged, though
he really proposed to me w’hen I was 15
and he 18. But there’s nothing of the lover
about him, and he’s dreadfully shy. Mother
always says that when he does marry he
will do the deed suddenly and quietly.”
“May I take you in to supper, Miss
Mackay?” asked Mr. Clarence, bowing low.
Mabel took the proffered arm. Mary
Jackson looked astonished, and wmtched the
pair out of sight, when she was claimed
by Professor Doyle’s son.
After supper Clarence asked Mabel to
walk with him in the palm court, and later
when they rejoined the others, Mabel’s face
was rosy red. At the conclusion of the bail
Mr. John Goodby, the head of the firm, an-
nounced his son’s engagement to Miss Mac-
kay, and also intimated that the marriage
would take place shortly.
• * • #
To the first “at home” that Mabel gave
as wife of Clarence Goodby, she invited all
the girls of the firm, who heartily congratu-
lated her on her good fortune in having such
a beautiful home. They wandered about
admiring this and that. And, of course, they
w r anted to see all her pretty frocks.
“What a sweet dressing-table set!” re-
marked Molly Wardlaw.
“I designed and made it myself,” said
Mabel.
“How nice this cream smells. What is it?”
“Oh, that’s Mercolized Wax —a really
lovely face-cream.”
“Ah-ha, is that what makes your com-
plexion so good?”
“It must be, because I’ve never used any
other cream. 1 would advise you to use it,
too.”
“I will.” “And I.” “And I,” echoed the
others.
“What’s your powder?”
“Barri-agar—just as good as the cream.”
“And what’s in this tin so cunningly en-
closed in a pretty little receptacle?”
“That’s Stallax —an excellent shampoo for
the hair. I never use anything else. And
if you’ll take a married woman’s advice,
girls, you’ll use these preparations, too, for
a goou complexion and good hair give one
an air of distinction.” — Advt. [3

.... Mombak : Real tragedy there—the tragedy that
only the gout-stricken and the thirsty know
Down and out,
Crippled with gout,
The actor strode ;
Each step he trode
He sighed ;
Hark ! who’s that a-weeping ?
Who indeed is creeping
Down the street with groans ?
As she dragged her weary bones .
She died.
One step, and he had lifted.
To her face his gaze had shifted,
ft hen he cried, “O God, my own!
But this moment you have flown
To a cloud.”
He staggered as if drunk.
And he groaned as he sunk;
In the gutter they didst find them,
And together they didst win 1 them
In a shroud.

“Ex-Dig.”: As a further sign of the ten-
dency to regard the war as over and done
with, the Red Cross Society has ceased to
distribute cigarettes and tobacco to sick
and disabled soldiers, and left the job to the
R.S.L. The cigarette end of the business
was never very well managed by the Red
Cross people. The War Chest Comforts
Fund gifts were invariably of good, sound,
Australian materials, but contracts were
made with some allegedly patriotic British
firms to supply a lot of the other gift cigar-
ettes, with the result that the poorest pos-
sible value was received for a large amount
of subscribed Australian money. The Brit-
ish firms quoted cheap prices, and provided
cheap smokes, apparently made from floor-
sweepings. Jettisoned packets of “Red
Hussars,” “Ruby Queens” and the like (the
manufacturers invented new names so as not
to prejudice their advertised brands) were
Scattered widely over the landscape in

Rows of Prettier Teeth Now
Note how teeth glisten everywhere to-day
You see glistening teeth in every circle
now. Millions have adopted a new way
of teeth cleaning. All the world over
dentists now advise it. Make this free
test and learn what it means to you.
That cloudy film
The cloud on teeth is film. At first
the film is viscous. You can feel it now.
But in ordinary brushing much of it
clings and stays, becomes discoloured and
forms dingy coats. Then teeth lose their
beauty.
Film also holds food substance which
ferments and forms acid. It holds the
acid in contact with the teeth to cause
decay. Germs breed by millions in it.
They, with tartar, are the chief cause of
pyorrhea.
Few escape such troubles if they do not
fight the film.
Now we combat it
Dental science, has in late years found
two film combatants. One disintegrates
the film, one removes it without harmful
scouring.
Able authorities have proved these
methods effective. A new-type tooth
paste has been created to apply, them
daily. The name is Pepsodent. Now
careful people the world over employ it,
largely by dental advice.
Its use delights
Pepsodent also multiplies the two great
tooth-protecting agents in the mouth.
These combined results are bringing to
millions a new dental era.
Protect the Enamel
Pepsodcnt disintegrates the film,
then removes it with an agent far
softer than enamel. Never use a
film combatant which contains
harsh grit.
Note how men’s teeth shine
Men who smoke have smoke-stained
film if they don’t remove it. But note
how men’s teeth glisten now —men who
combat the film. You see those results
now wherever you look. If you admire
them, make this test. Learn how they
attain them.

“Tally Ho” : Tlie Speck’s newest industry
is cement-making at Maria Island, on the
East Coast; an output of 35,000 tons a year
is provided for. A. G. Bernacchi, lately pic-
tured in Tile Bulletin, thought out the
scheme 10 years ago, and was on hand to see
the first limestone smashed early this month.
The island ran Brettingham Moore’s sheep
until it wms taken over by the National, Port-
land Cement Co.
“Mel” : Melbourne has long since forgot-
ten when it first said good morning to Talbot
Simmonds, who, well over 80, is still the
city’s best-known cigar traveller. The old
chap speaks airily of the ball given to the
Duke of Edinburgh, and other events of the
Middle Ages, and goes skating when-
ever he. gets a chance. If tobacco is a
poison it must be very slow in action, as
Simmonds smokes the strongest of his own
wares.
* * * «
“Zanthus”: The first whaling out of
Sydney, and probably the first on
the Australian coast, was done at
the end of 1701 by the Britannia.
William Raven master, and the William and
Ann, Ebor Bunker master. They killed
seven whales the day after leaving Port Jack-
son, . but lost five of them in a gale.
During the rest of the fortnight that they
spent at sea they saw plenty of whales, but
it was too rough to kill any. So they stood
over to the coast of South America.
* * * *
“Veronal”: The first passenger vessel to
regularly run the 73 between Sydney
and Newcastle was a trim little cutter known
as the Lord Liverpool, which in 1827 made
a weekly trip between these ports. The cabin
fare was £1 65., which included not only
tucker but also “wines and spirits,” accord-
ing to a contemporary advt. The Lord
Liverpool, a pleasure yacht brought from
India, could hardly have been a fast sailer, as
she is said to have taken 12 hours to do the
journey under favoring conditions.
* * * •
“Robert Bruce”: Have insurance offices
a sliding scale of address for their clients
based upon the amounts they are insured
for? I ask because my renewal notice in
respect of a £lOO policy is addressed to Mr.
Robert Bruce, and the reminder of premium
due on a £5OO policy to Robert Bruce,
Esquire; and I have just inspected two simi-
lar notices sent to a friend—in a demand
for £5 he is mistered, and in one for £2O he
is esquired. I am wondering how small my
investment would need to be to reduce me
to mere Robert Bruce, and what manner of
address would a £lO,OOO policy bring forth.
* * * *
“Tomeff” : Dining in a country pub, I sat
near the screen. Old Bob was the waiter.
To the first four customers he recited the
bill-of-fare: “Corn beef. Roast lamo.
Brown stew.” Three went for lamb and
one picked beef. In the next bunch there
was again a clear majority for lamb, with
no bidders for stew. Then there was an
exchange of whispers at the slide. When the
next crowd pulled in Old Bob leaned over
their shoulders and said, “Corn beef. Roast
lamb. Braized steak.” This time roast
lamb fell back a couple of furlongs, and
braized steak took the lead. He was still
a hot favorite when I left. There’s a whole
pile in a name.
<** # * *
“Nugget”: It is quite common to find
cookies driving their herds about the
roads in search of grass during a dry
spell; but a Hunter River (N.S.W.) bee-
farmer once gained a little notoriety by
grazing his stock on “the long paddock.”
Successive bad seasons had so reduced his
income that he mounted about half a dozen
of his best working hives in a tipdray, and
toured them round the flowering lucerne
patches some miles from his home. The
experiment was quite a success, turning in,
for those times, a good living wage over a
period of nearly IS months. Hunter River
lucerne matures quickly, and frequent rob-
bing of the hives was the order of the day.
But what would have happened had a strange
horse been put between the shafts is a thing
fearsome to contemplate.
“Delver”: The 12-500-ton Fordsdale, the
biggest ship yet built in Australia, had her
trial run outside Sydney Harbor the other
day. The first of her line was the* Nancy,
launched in 1803; and the Integrity fol-
lowed next year. But the first Australian
launching was nearly 10 years earlier, the
Francis being sent from London in parts.
James Underwood had the first regular ship-
building yard: Underwood-street marks the
site —a narrow alley that runs from Pitt-
street up to The Bulletin’s printing works,
buried behind the office in George-street. The
S. M. Herald was a neighbor of Under-
wood’s in' the ’forties; and Mister John, if
he ever thought of such a thing, might have
called in almost next door at the Blue
Anchor, still a pub, for his morning rum.
Then or thereabout it was kept by “Cocky”
Hanson, whose descendants are numerous.
Jim Underwood’s first boat was the King
George: it was launched in 1805.
THE SAD STORY OF THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He stood before me, wan and pale
As baker who has dene his dough,
And told a yarn that could not tail
To drag a pint of beer or so.
“Once I had work, some cash put by,
An’ owned me ’ouse, so ’elp me bob!
A prosp’rous chimney-sweep was 1,
But through bad luck I lost me job.
“I married. One fine day I rose
An’ asked th’ wife: ‘Where did yer pul
My suit of honist workin’ clo’es
And that there little bag o’ soot V
“She’d thrown th’ ’ole lot out! Well, sir,
You never seen a sweep work clean.
Clean clothed and faced I could not stir
Ter do a tap—see what I mean ?
“ ’Ome from me work I ’ad ter keep
An’ lose me jobs with all their pelf;
I could not be a proper sweep
Without some soot to black meself!”

Studebaker Light-Six 5-Seater Touring Car
Australian Body —£4ss; Imported Body—sL47s
Studebaker specialises in the build-
ing of six-cylinder motor cars exclu-
sively.
Because the Studebaker Big-Six, the
Special-Six and the Light-Six are all
powered by six-cylinder engines,
every Studebaker possesses those
attributes which are identified with
the world’s finest motor cars, namely:
quick acceleration, abundant power,
smoothness of operation and practi-
cal freedom from vibration.
Thus the Studebaker owner has
double assurance of satisfaction in
the known advantages of a six-
cylinder engine, and in the knowl-
edge that his car is built by special-
ists in six-cylinder construction.
Great financial and physical re-
sources with 72 years of manufac-
turing experience enables Studebaker
to build the utmost value into its
products.

Hein the Hospitals to-flay. iou might want then hell _
This from an English friend:
Our housemaid had decided to migrate to Australia,
and the occasion called for some words, of motherlj
advice. “I suppose you’ve'never been to sea before, ..
Anne, have youl” r ‘‘Xo. mum; leastways, onl>
paddling.” .
“The most businesslike Parliament I know.
It is more like the meeting of a board of
directors of a business concern. The first
thing that impresses one is the absence of
party bickering. There is no quibbling, lhe
members are -there to do business efficiently
and without waste of time.” Thus Dr.
Thacker, former M.P. for Christchurch
(M.L.). He was speaking of the Dail
Eireann.
“S.T.S.”: That picture of Oswald Pryor’s
(B. 17/l/’24), about the impossibility of a
preacher being a good one because “ ’e u»ed
to live next door to we,” recalls my dear old"
friend. Losing her own doctor, she was
advised to employ a younger one, a friend
of the family. He was about 40, ana a
widower, but she saw him still as the kid
next door. “Certainly not,” she said. ‘ Why,
I can remember him stealing our oranges.
“Two Seas”: H. P. Brown, whose appoint-
ment as head of the P.M.G.’s Department
at £2500 a year has stirred up protests in
postal circles, rose from the job of sorter
to that of assistant staff-engineer at the
London G.P.O. During the war he con-
trolled the emergency telephone arrange-
ments for anti-aircraft defence in the Cold
Country, and afterwards reorganised the
Calcutta telephone service for the Indian
Government. He is still five years short
of 50.
Rev. H. H. Anderson (“Micky” to his
pupils), formerly headmaster of the Hutch-
ins School, Hobart, has alwhys been an un-
usual kind of parson. He is now rector of
New Norfolk, where the hops come from,
and the other day his parishioners broke
to him the joyftil news, that it had been
decided to increase his stipend. He thanked
them, but told them lie was quite satisfied
to go on as he was, and if they had any
spare cash he hoped they would give it to
the organist, who needed it more than he did.
“Daub’s” little plea :
The heads of the N.S.W. State Conservatorium of
Music might well follow the example of the authori-
ties at the ’Varsity and have portraits hung in lhe
corridors of those who have done music a service in
Australia. There are in Sydney a portrait of Ver-
brugghen by Norman Carter, a very interesting study
of Alfred Hill by Tom Roberts, and an excellent one
of Frank Hutchens, recently painted by J. Muir
Auld. The director of the Conservatorium should be
the subject of another, and good copies could be
obtained of the portrait of William Saurin Dyster
in the Melbourne Gallery and that of Vincent Wallace
in the Dublin Gallery.
“R.R.” : I helped to gather the last census,
and got several surprises; but the one that
will stick to me occurred in a short street
whose cottages were occupied by Murphy,
Reddy, O’Regan. Patrick. Shanesy, O’Sulli-
van, Kelly, O’Brien, O’Connor, Shanahan,
Riley, Fitzpatrick and Connell. There was
not a single R.C. in the lot. Four were Con-
gregationals, three Presbyterians, three YV es-
leyans, one a Freethinker, another a Chris-
tian Scientist, and one described himself and
family as Agnostic. What was perhaps
stranger still, not one was a native of the
Verdant Isle. Three had been born in Scot-
land, one in England, one in Wales, one in
India and one in Canada; the rest were
Australians.
“Yoyang”: .Judge-Advocate John Wyldc
got Australia her first bank. When he arrived
in 1816 there was no settled currency, and
trade was largely done by barter, mostly
in rum; for the assorted coin in circulation,
including Spanish dollars, ducats, Johannas,
pagodas and Dutch guilders, was far from
meeting requirements. Wyldc collected the
chief landowners, merchants, etc., and it was
decided to establish a “colonial” bank. On
April 8,1817, it was opened, the seven direc-
tors being D’Arcy Wentworth, John Harris,
Robert Jenkins, Thomas Wylde, Alexander
Riley, Wm. Redfern and J. T. Campbell. The
bank was housed in Macquarie-place, in Mrs.
Reibey’s cottage. Incidentally, Gov. Mac-
quarie wanted one of the directors to be a
protege of his —an ex-convict merchant. The
shareholders turned him down, which made
the Governor persistently hostile to the in-
fant Bank of New South Wales.
“C. Coral” : When the Kanakas were given
a return pass to their own islands from
Bananaland some years back, those who had
married Torres Strait wives were given the
option of remaining in the country, and a
reserve was set apart on Moa Island (Torres
Strait) under the joint supervision of the
Protector of Abos. and the Anglican Church.
The community was a pretty poor one, and
for a good while Tommy Tanna hadn’t a
camphor-wood chest, much less anything to
put inside it; but he has prospered in his
gardening and fishing, and, after a trial
run last year with rented boats, he has now
formed a pearling and beche-de-mer syndi-
cate, which has been legally registered ' as
the' Moa Fishing Co. A dozen or so share-
holders —all colored —have put capital into
the concern, and a European firm acts as
their selling agents. Pretty soon now the
franchise will be wanted.
“R.” : Never mind which State this hap-
pened in; it did happen, and I know nothing
wJiich better shows the initiative, and re-
source of the Australian workman. , A train
was timed to reach its destination on Satur-
day evening, and commence the return jour-
ney the following afternoon. After deposit-
ing its passengers it was run out of the
station as usual, but an unfortunate shunt
twisted every buffer and chopper, putting
the whole rake of coaches out of action.
Heroic measures were called for if serious
trouble was to be averted, and the guard
held a conference with the engine-driver
and fireman. Early on Sunday morning they
collected all the cobbers they could find and
set to work, first removing all the damaged
iron-work and then building fires to make
the metal red hot. It was a big job. but an
hour before starting-time they had the
twisted buffers straightened and the train
made up again. Although the carriages sub-
sequently passed through the hands qf
examiners the crude repairs weren’t detected,
and the crew received no “Please explains”
to fit lies to.

Rexona Shaving Soap
(Medicated)
The Triangular Stick.
Rexona Shaving Soap will be found the most economical stick on the
market, but care should be exercised not to dip the stick in the water,
but wet the face and apply the shaving stick dry. A few applica-
tions with the shaving brush will quickly produce a thick, creamy
lather, which lasts and thoroughly softens the beard, leaving the skin
m a healthy and hygienic condition after the shave. Everyone should
use a medicated soap for shaving, for, after removing the beard and
going over the face with a razor, the skin needs a protection from the
germs carried by the dust, which everyone has to face.
Rexona Shaving Soap is packed in decorated, pure aluminium con-
tainers, which are strong, light and durable, and will not rust, and
which keep the shaving soap in perfect
condition. Price 1/6.

Moon-woven airs and gay.
Paper and pen, my quiet room! The dreams
Draw very close and sweet;

Spring passes on pale feet.
Pi own the starry fields of Arcady,
To woo to dancing joy
His.lissom love, a lilting melody

Or in lost Avalon, by orchards brown,
I watch the red moon rise,
Sheer o’ dark trees, while the enchanted

Still as the tranced king lies.
Laughter and echoed song down glades a-

Have roused the drowsy faun,
Couched amid shadows on the grass, night-

Dryads come near with dawn.

Within the wood age-old—
The wood of legend—queens once fair and tall
Linger in robes of gold.
Dreaming—vain dreaming; for of all these

I make no golden song
Flaming with vision, with the surge of wings
Lifting it swift and strong

They overwhelm my soul—
Here on the earth’s last lonely isle I wake
Heart-weary of their roll.

Wild Oats.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Harrison smith sat tapping his
pencil on the scratched table. A
man who talked like a gramophone
had just been in offering a job-line of rub-
bers and seribbling-blocks, cheap. He had
closed with the offer, and now sat glooming,
wondering unhappily if he had acted for the
best.
_ That was characteristic of Harrison
Smith. He rushed headlong into things, and
then made himself the wretched prey of
doubts and worries and petty remorse for
days afterwards.
He looked drearily out of the window on
to a straggling lawn, where clover ran
matted with the coarse grass. Beyond lay
the playing-fields of the boys, dusty, and
hemmed in by a paling fence. A rusty
gate, swinging half open to the street, bore
the legend The Burrabeen Grammar
School for Boys.
It was called by courtesy a Grammar
School. The council, presided over by the
portly, voluble vicar, comprised the whole
of the vestry—town worthies to the number
of six, whose interest was more or less spas-
modic. At intervals they assumed an owl-
ish wisdom, and looked over the school
books, and gave captious criticism. On
Speech days the vicar distributed the prizes,
cutting short the list to get on to his speech
the sooner. Harrison Smith, 8.A., the
headmaster, had not yet come under the cen-
sorious tongue, and the school apparently
prospered.
It was a small school of perhaps 40 day-
boys and a handful of boarders drawn from
the surrounding district. It was not tin*
most modern seat of learning, but it sufficed
for windy, dusty little Burrabeen, and Burra-
been was proud of it. It had a small, in-
efficient staff, under the rule of Jenkins, the
first assistant. The headmaster’s part in
the school routine was negligible.
Harrison Smith himself had been a Public
School boy, and his University career had
been marked by sundry lurid incidents due
to a lack of proper restraint and a mania for
gambling. He had held various offices for
various lengths of time, had been a teacher
in the Department, an unsuccessful farmer
in Canada, a Melbourne librarian, and a
tutor on a station. The last job had been
relinquished in a hurry, owing to a fond-
ness for the cut-glass decanters on the side-
board. Finally had come, through the good
offices of an old friend, the offer of Burra-
been, with its promise of peace and immunity
from financial worries.
Harrison Smith got up from the table,
shaking himself like a wet mastiff. He was
rather like a great dog, with his large head,
immense shoulders and long arms. He was
lean to gauntness, his bowed back and
slouching gait the travesty of the fine giant
he should have been.
He stared out of the window. Thunder-
clouds rolled up, showing a hard silver line
that reminded him horribly of the white of
an upturned eye. The bare, dead trees
stretching away to the plains had a bone-
white deathly appearance. As he looked,
ne left that old oppression of spirit. Always
at this ghostly hour of the day, when the
school was most silent, he would sit in his
study, driven back on his thoughts. They
were not the pleasantest thoughts. They
flitted m and out of his brain, making little
kaleidoscopic pictures that vanished before
he could visualise them properly. With his
fantastic imagination he saw them as little
colored squares of lantern-slides, flung on to
the barren sheet of his mind.
Harrison Smith was a couple of years
under fifty, unprepossessing now, and with-
out personality. As a young man he had
had a certain attraction for women. Many
had made love to him. Thinking back he
told himself that, of all, one perimns hnd
truly loved him, and that was AnmTlane
Annie Lane, dead and buried, belonging to
that jast of his that was also <loj!l "aad
But was the past ever completely dead and
buried? Harrison Smith slumped down into
P vi ng a slant lookat the
clock that ticked with an irritating loud-
ness. Could you ever break down effectively
what you had builded up? Get away from
what you had done? You sowed and you
reaped accordingly, so it was said. He
smiled cynically. Well, his wild oats had
been sowed years before. Sometimes in
these ghostly silences he could see, with tkat
imaginative brain of his, miles and miles of
wild oats growing higher and higher round
his feet, barring his progress. Absurd!
lie thrust out his boot as though to push
through the imaginary entanglement.
There was a discreet knock at the door.
Jenkins, mean-moutlied and smiling-eyed,
sidled in. There was something of sub-
dued excitement and rancor in his pale face.
Harrison Smith looked up frowning, hoping,
as he had often hoped on similar occasions*
that this was going to be a situation that
he could successfully cope with. He had
a sudden abject fear that someone might
have seen him coming out of the public-
house the night before, with three paper-
wrapped bottles.
“It's that boy again,” said Jenkins tri-
umphantly.
“Wliat—oh, Anderson,” said the head-
master with a vague relief. His thoughts
went ticking on again.
His lack of interest annoyed the first
assistant. “You’ve always been too easy
with him,” he said in a whine, half-
blustering, half-supercilious. “Now you’ll
have to let him see.” He spread out over
the ink, his lips moving rapidly. “This
time it cannot be overlooked. He’s abso-
lutely unprincipled and beyond reasoning
with. He has brought drink into the
school. I have that for a fact. And gamb-
ling again ! I’ve mentioned my suspicions
before. Now I have my proofs.” He flung
down a pack of thumbed cards, and some
silver coins.
The headmaster fingered his chin ner-
vously. Pie was up against Jenkins again.
It was the old, old thing. He was too lenient.
He was always ready to let things slip, with
the trite remark, “Oh, well, boys will be
boys!”_ Now Jenkins, self-satisfied and
managing, the real guiding hand of the Bur-
rabeen Grammar School, challenged him to
repeat those fatal errors of leniency.
“There’s only one thing to be done,” said
the first assistant, shooting out his lower
lip.
“Yes?” The older man sounded vague
and helpless.
“You’ll expel him, of course,” went on the
other. “Either that or inform the coun-
cil”—
“I—oh, yes, naturally,” agreed the head-
master.
The veins in his temples began to swell.
What did Jenkins take him for?' Surely he
could be expected to have sufficient initiative
in this matter! He would show the school
—and Jenkins—that the good name of Burra-
been Grammar was not to be marred with
impunity. He was the Head. His word was
law. But all this was foolish, childish
bluster. Harrison Smith could see it bub-
bling up and dying down inside his brain,
like the wind-brought foam in an emptying
pool. Yet, as Jenkins pointed out, the boy
was certainly a bad example to the rest of
the school. That must be considered- —the
moral tone and all that! A likeable enough
lad, though, with crisp, curling hair, deep-
seated blue eyes, and a chin that was a
trifle weak. Studious, too! Beyond that he
came from one of the outlying farms, as a
boarder, he knew nothing of him.
“Send Anderson to me when you go out!”
he said shortly.
Jenkins suspected a hesitancy that was
not there. He leaned over.
The fellow was insolent to me,” he said.
“He goes—or I!”
The headmaster flinched. He had heard
that threat before, but never delivered with
such meaning. Jenkins certainly meant it
this time. And if Jenkins were to go! The
older man felt his distress rising. It was
Jenkins who kept the school going, really—
ordered, bullied and labored. Doubtless it
had pleased him to be there, nominally second
in command, but actually first. Yes, lie
would be lost without Jenkins—a rudderless
shin in a storm. The council would know
of his absent-mindedness, his faculty for let-
ting things slide. They would know of his
late rising, and his little nips taken in the
seclusion of the study to enable him to get
through the day. If Jenkins went, lie went
too. Nothing was surer! And he did not
want to leave Burrabecn.
“I shall deal with this matter myself,” he
said, mustering up a weak dignity. “Send
Anderson.”
The first assistant withdrew, unimpressed,
while Harrison Smith sat looking 1 in front
of him, at the desk with its untidy writing
materials, its scratched surface and ink-
stains (he was always careless about the
ink), at the calendar that marked the begin-
ning of the last term.
There was a scuffle outside the door, and
a knock.
“Come in !” he ordered sharply.
He felt that much hung on this interview.
It was momentous. Now was the time for
him to vindicate himself in the eyes of the
insufferable little tyrant Jenkins, and in the
eyes of the school.
boy stood by the table—a heavilv-
built boy of seventeen, with a furtive, half-
ashamed air, and a brick-red in his face.
Well, Anderson?”
The headmaster’s voice was harsh and
rasping. It seemed to astonish the boy. The
red deepened to his neck.
“You’re a bad influence in the school,”
rapped the man, steeling himself to meet the
boy s miserable eyes. “You are to be ex-
pelled ignominiously. You know why?”
“Yes!”
The voice was a whisper. But the face
held pained surprise. It was as though he
doubted if he had heard aright.
The headmaster understood, and his irri-
tation gathered weight. The bov had been
banking on his proverbial softness. Doubt-
less throughout the whole school conjecture
had been rife as to the outcome of this
interview.
“I won’t have you, d’you hear?” he
snapped. ‘l’ll not give you another chance.
You’re always in mischief. This is not the
first time.”
The boy muttered something. The words
came blundering out —swift excuses and
pleas for pardon. It had only been a lark
They had had a birthday party after hours.
And as for the cards —they had always
played of a night at the farm.

POISONED SORE CAUSES
HONTHS OF SUFFERING.
Loss of Limb Feared.
Remarkable Zam-Buk Healing.
Mr. C. B. Coates, Customs Officer, Rabaul,
West Pacific, writes: —“Eighteen months
ago, whilst wading ashore through shallow
water, I cut my ankle on a piece of con-
cealed coral.
“Soon .the sore began to give me great pain
and swelled to an alarming size, so that I
had to lay up as soon as I got back to
Rabaul. I thought that I would doubtless
lose my foot, as others have done through
the same thing, and, the doctors failing to
relieve me, I was obliged to tender my
resignation to the Administration, and try
to treat the ghastly sore myself, in the hope
of saving my limb.
“I tried all kinds of things without result,
and was getting reconciled to the idea of
having my foot taken off, when I happened
to be in the store in the township, and ob-
tained a box of Zam-Buk. After two or three
applications of a generous amount of your
ointment I found that the angry look seemed
to get a healthier color, the discharge grew
less, and I was so overjoyed at the improve-
ment that I returned to the store and bought
the whole of their stock. Using Zam-Buk
more often, and in liberal doses, I pen-se-
vered with the treatment until the improve-
ment. became more and more apparent, and,
though slow, the cure was certain.
“At present I_am...thankful to say that. I
am in the full enjoyment of a perfectly
healthy foot, and am able to cliinh around the
hilly places and walk long distances, with
nothing more serious than a scar, which is
the only reminder of long months of agony.
“I truthfully believe that Zam-Buk saved
me from being a cripple for the rest of my
life, and I can only half express my grati-
tude to its curative powers, and shall cer-
tainly recommend it to others.”
Beware of Poisoned Sores
‘!i — —-
Apply ZAM-BUK promptly to any
Gut, Scratch, Burn, or Scald
To guard against infection by
disease-germs and consequent
festering and blood-poison, you
should immediately apply anti-
septic Zam-Buk to any cut, burn,
bruise, scald, abrasion, or any
broken condition of your skin.
The injury that is dressed with
Zam-Buk will not fester—there is
no fear of complications—because
Zam-Buk, when applied, immedi-
ately attacks and kills off the
insidious germs which are the
cause of skin disease.
If you already have a poisoned
sore, a festering cut, or any skin
trouble too obstinate for ordinary
treatment, Zam-Buk, by reason of
its wonderful antiseptic and germi-
cidal powers, will quickly kill all
infection, and ensure healthy
healing.
Zam-Buk is the worker s best
friend—often saves months of suf-
fering, forced ‘ time off, and loss
of wages.
Zam-Buk is compact —always
ready for instant use —always
reliable; therefore a box should
be kept handy in every home and
workshop.

Makes Keeps the Skin Healthy
The headmaster kept a rope on himself.
Just so might he have excused himself at
seventeen —not standing up manfully accept-
ing defeat in silence, but clutching des-
perately at the first straw of hope that
offered. With something of horror he
seemed to see himself in this lad at the table.
Himself at seventeen, ripe for mischief and
adventure, crazy for the taste of unknown
pleasures, trying his hand with luck! And
here lie' was, not fifty, prematurely old,
shaken, and without confidence in himself —
a failure!
“That’s enough of self-justification,” lie
said violently, bringing down his fist. "You
go ! I’ve .made up my mind.”
He must not soften, he told himself.
There was Jenkins to be thought of. Jen-
kins. or this lad! This time it was going
to be a win for Jenkins. All his pit# was
gone. He was conscious of victory.
The boy was silent. Ilis face had a des-
perate whiteness about it. lie thrust him-
self forward. The headmaster, watching,
realised that the last vestige of his self-
control had vanished, and he was looking-
down on to a young soul that seemed to be
fighting him for its very existence.
“Sir, if you would only give me another
chance! I swear I will be steady.” The
boy’s voice had a sob of entreaty through
it. “You don’t know what it will mean
to me if I have to go back on the farm now.
I’m doing the last exam., and I can go on
to the University next year. I’ve worked
—you know I have, sir! Mr. Anderson —
that’s my uncle, sir—thinks I should be on
the farm now; but I persuaded him into let-
ting me keep on, and I work all harvest-
time. They’d throw mud at me now if I
landed back like this. They always seem
ready to expect something bad of me, just
because—oil, I don’t know! They used to
sling it at. my mother’; too. She died before
I was seven. She made me promise to keep
to my books. That was in the big hill coun-
try, sir”—-
He stopped, acutely conscious of himself
and the enormity of his offence —a schoolboy
blubbering of his dead mother!
“The big hill country?” said the head-
master vaguely. Somehow those four words
seemed familiar, as though he had heard
someone say them. He wished that the clock
would stop ticking. It was hard to concen-
trate.
“Round Bright, sir. My mother had a
place with walnut-trees. They used to grow
thick at Dempsey’s Creek. Then she died,
and I went to live with my aunt. They
changed my name from Lane to Anderson.
I don’t know why I’m saying all this, sir.”
The headmaster made a little, helpless
gesture. He stared in front of him, and
could see again right out to the hill country
and Dempsey’s Creek, where Annie Lane’s
place was, and the big, shady walnut-trees.
He had gone to Canada in a hurry about
that time. He had heard nothing. Annie
had never written. When he had come back
he had learned that the child was nearly
three years old. He had gone up to see
her, then a calm, plump woman content with
her lot, and asking so little of him that he
had gone away shamefacedly again.
He looked up. It was strange to think
that he was looking into the face of his son
—his son, in whom he could see himself —
the same failings and inherited tendencies!
This was a monstrous jest of Fate. He
called upon to judge the son whom he had
endowed with his own wayward nature!
lie passed his fingers over his mouth to
hide its trembling.
“Sit down,” lie said in an odd, flat voice.
The boy sat, sensing that something had
happened.
“I’ll give you this chance,” said the head-
master, speaking slowly, as though each word
were wrung from him. “But I want you
to remember it, Jim. Life doesn’t give many
chances.”
He talked on in a low voice, his hands
shading his eyes. It was rather beautiful,
all that he said. Harrison Smith had never
spoken quite like that to anyone before. The
boy realised that. It was about building
the foundations of life—the good foundation
—and about the rotten one on which no-
thing fine or stable could stand.
“You can go now, my lad,” said the head-
master, pushing back his chair, the lines
down his face grooved deeply.
The boy stumbled to his feet. “Thank
you, sir. I’ll never forget.” His smile was
almost sunny.
The headmaster put out his hand, groping
a little. “If you should want me any time,”
he said, still in that odd, flat voice, “here
is my address, written down.”
“Won’t you be here, sir?”
“I shall not be here long,” said the head-
master with a smile. “In fact, I may leave
at—at any time.”
“I’m sorry, sir!” The boy’s voice was
regretful.
Harrison Smith sat in the dusk. The
room was full of shadows, but he wanted
the dark. He could think more clearly.
Jenkins brushed in, cool and insolent.
“Well?” he demanded.
“Anderson stays on.” said the headmaster
in a distinct voice. “It was just the ebulli-
tion of high spirits. It would be a pity at
this point of his scholastic career”
“Then I send in my resignation,” bleated
Jenkins. “At once!”
“As you please.” The headmaster’s
voice was colorless. “I—l, too, will be
going. Shut the door as you go out.”
He was alone with the shadows, the night
pushing against the window. With that
fantastic inward eye of his, he seemed to see
a thin, shadowy mass of wild oats all about
him—a menacing sea of silvery green that
hemmed him in and threatened to engulf him.
MYRA MORRIS.
The Dark Eye of Ko Cheng.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AN excellent baker was Ko Cheng, but
he certainly had a queer way of
avenging an insult. The passen-
gers spoke well of his biscuits and rolls after
12 days of voyaging, when the most satisfied
are likely to become querulous and the
mildest lose their meekness. By that time,
usually, any manner of breeze is both too
harsh and too soft, the day’s run too much
and too little, the deck games too dull and
too noisy, rendered so by some astonishing
alchemy of human boredom. And the food,
of course, is altogether wrong. It is then
that old hates grow hot while eager new
friendships are most utterly broken, and
there is a rolling wildness? in the eye of the
best-natured of pursers. And the intensity
of all these strange happenings is so much
the greater when the voyaging is done
through tropic seas, where white skins are
greasy and white nerves are scorched. But
Ko Cheng just went on with his baking in
his calm, yellow way, and worried little that
the ship had been nosing about the Line for
some days through warm, greasy waters and
hot, wet air. And never a complaint was
heard about the baking of Ko Cheng. Balm,
this, to the soul of the artist, and the slit
eyes and placid face of Ko showed content
as much as they might show anything. So
it was until the morning of the thirteenth
day.
Save for a weakening of the westerly mon-
soonal wind and an added moisture in the
humid air, there was nothing distinctive
about the day; but the brain'of Ko Cheng
was somehow seething and bubbling behind
his yellow mask, and there was torment in
the yellow soul of him. There was no de-
fined reason or cause for this. Perhaps a
dispute he had had with that indecent fat
cook, Sin Loo, in the matter of the owner-
ship of a certain disreputable singlet, had
helped things along. But really all the
tumbling and turmoil of liis spirit was a
variety of nerve-storm, the like of which in
a minor degree Ko had known once or twice
before. A sort of distant cousin of the con-
dition that leads to the amokness of a Malay
or the hysterical fit of a European.
Truly the fat Sin Loo had been unspeak-
ably vile, but the singlet remained honor-
ably with Ko Cheng, and it was, anyway,
in a much moth-eaten state. Ordinarily the
placidity of Ivo Cheng would have been little
ruffled by the affair; but. this morning the
seething still went on within him as he
slapped the familiar dough, and the mem-
ories of old injustices gnawed at his mind
like so many worms. There had been the
white man at the hotel .at Batavia, where
Ko had worked years before when young
and newly arrived in the strange country.
The thought was old and all but forgotten,
but grew suddenly vivid in his queenly active
brain. Bis fault had been small and of igno-
rance only, but the white man had spoken
of policemen and death as the penalty. The
very young mind of Ko Cheng had worked
on literal lines in those days, and he had
once watched the end of a criminal in his
own town, and the sounding of the.huge gong
of the hotel soon after had meant to him
but one thing—the summons to the execu-
tion of Ko Cheng. Straightway he had fled,
but the fear went with .him and remained
with him for many months. There was, too,,
that cruellest of Dutchmen at Soerabaja,
wh0....
In and out through the old dead thoughts
the mind of Ko Cheng twisted and turned
its unhealthy way as he punched the great
masses of dough. And then, suddenly, hands
and brain alike were still. Hard by a tray
of freshly-baked rolls stood the unseemly
fat Sin Loo, and as Ivo’s eyes fell upon
him he lifted one from the most neatly-
browned and. wonderfully-crusted rows. He
studied it for a moment, and then bit into
it. Now, Sin Loo was not hungry. His
thoughts, too, were straying. It had been
only the pure artistry of Ko’s finished work
that had tempted his eye beyond the reason-
ing of his stomach. If Ko had only known,
it was the most wonderful tribute to his
genius. But Ko Cheng did not know.
The protesting and sated appetite of Sin
Loo claimed his notice at the first bite, and
he cast the roll into a corner with all the
regret of a connoisseur who turns awav from
a masterpiece lie may not buy. But. Ko did
not know this either. To him ai>»ssags§i«vb
the most dishonorable insult cast upon him
and his work by the so hateful, fat Sin Loo,
and his whirling hates found a centre. In
a harsh jabber he reviled this unworthy cook,
and the astonished Sin Loo jabbered back.
Their frenzied abuse seemed to rebound, so
Quickly it hurtled from one to the other.
Second by second the angry excitement of
Ko Cheng grew, and with it his voice rose
to a peculiar, nervous screech. Frantically
his arms waved and his face grimaced and
gibbered. Great beads of sweat rolled from
his close-cropped black head, and his body
shook violently. And all over the matter
of one small roll.
A look of doubt, almost of fear, appeared
on the face of the cook, but he sped one last
insult. The throat of Ko Cheng throbbed
visibly, the veins stood clear on his temple.
He had reached the very crisis of his nerve-
storm. With a strangled sound curiously
compounded of a gulp and a scream he tossed
his hands wildly in the air. rushed quickly
aft. and without hesitation leaped over the
rail.
If was 15 minutes later before the ship
could be rounded, and one of the starboard
boats was lowered and away. As. they neared
Ko Cheng he was still swimming strongly
away from them. The mate reached an oar
and more or less gently tapped the bobbing
black skull with it, and a very wet baker
was hauled on board.
Back on deck Ko Cheng seemed little hurt
but vague. As some kindly person pressed
brandy on him he was understood to mutter
something about “the gong for the execu-
tion,” which didn’t clear matters at all
And then a still kinder ship’s officer fixed
handcuffs on his wrists and locked him away
for safe keeping.
It was a Dutchman of many years and
much knowledge of Java who threw a casual
small light on the darkness. “Oh, yes-s.”
he explained, “so common in zose people.
‘Dark-eye,’ ‘red-eye,’ they call it.”
As a medical curiosity it was interesting,
but I could not help thinking that, as a
method of revenge on one’s friend the enemy,
it was entirely too subtle.
