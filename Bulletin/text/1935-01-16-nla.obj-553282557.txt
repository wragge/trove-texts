EZRA’S
ESSAYS
Ezra Pound in
his new book of
old words. Make
It New : “..;; it
is perfectly ascertainable that a number
of njen in succeeding epochs have man-
aged to be intelligible to each other con-
cerning a gamut of perceptions which
other bodies of men wholly deny.” Later
he sums up; “It is quite obvious that
we do not all of us inhabit the same
time.”
These statements are interesting, be-
cause they are the basis of “The Waste
Land” and “A Draft of Thirty Cantos,”
two poems as dissimilar in tone, as are
their authors.
But, little differences aside, Eliot and
Pound are united in the belief in the
“contemporaneity of great literature”;
they do not so much wish to entertain
their friends of this generation as to
unite, over a dish of tea in one case and
a mug of beer in the other, their literary
forefathers. So we find Eliot writing so
that Dante may have something to read
in heaven, and Pound shaking up a cock-
tail to give Homer a kick in hell. Laud-
able pastimes, but the reader who knows
his own language, but not Greek, Latin,
Provenfal, French, Italian, German or
Sanscrit, and who is not familiar with
the lesser masterpieces of those tongues,
including the writings of the early Chris-
tian fathers, will find himself a stranger
in the circles of “The Waste Land” and
the Cantos, and very irritatingly missing
the points of the family jokes.
So, while it is not for us to criticise,
but rather for Dante and Homer (and
their opinions of Eliot and Pound would
surely be interesting), it would be fool-
ish not to understand as much as we
can of such profound and accomplished
authors. The tendency here is to say
outright that Ezra Pound is no good, but
Esmeralda Toodle will do great things
some day; and that is exactly the kind
of generalisation to which Ezra Pound
in his poetry and his criticism opposes
himself:
“The difference between what is
known and what is merely faked or sur-
mised has at all times seemed to me
worth discovering.” This scientific
American tone is the tone of all modern
criticism that is worth anything ; and it
is so Pound discusses Troubadours,
Arnaut Daniel, Elizabethan Classicists,
Translators of Greek, French Poets,
Henry James, Remy de Gourmont and
Guido Cavalcanti.
His essays on Troubadours and Daniel
are expellent introductions to those
writers, but add very little to what was
available in English in a book by a
woman at the end of last century, ex-
cept, perhaps, the suggestion that they
were philosophically minded; which is
maybe going a bit too far; the singers
who produced such new and lively
rhythms as
Suis-je, suis-je, suis-je belle
can be most easily understood in the
original; the meaning scarcely seems to
matter ; also, the translations given are
not the Pound sterling ; but the discus-
sions of the technic of Provencal versi-
fication are very interesting. Certainly in
these essays, and in the essays on Eliza-
bethan Classicists and on Translators of
Greek, he is quite thorough: you feel
that he has found out and said every-
thing worth saying on those subjects,
but that you don’t want to hear any
more about them. There are some good
observations on modern French poetry,
with examples (1918). This essay opens
with high praise of “a New Zealand
paper, ‘The Triad,”’ for having “better
regular criticism of contemporary French
publications than any American periodi-
cal ever had.” But this essay has been
since somewhat superseded by the bril-
liant study by Peter Quenncl, Baudelaire
and the Symbolists (Chatto and Windus),
which lets in more light biographically.
The most useful essay in the book is
an exhaustive survey of the work of
Henry James; no finer handbook to a
great writer could be imagined; his
work is considered book by book, with
many keen observations on the technic
of novel-writing, and a summary of
James’s theory of the novel. After
James, he considers Gourmont, oppos-
ing him to James as “an artist in the
nude.” These two, he contends, sum up
the “state of human consciousness in the
decades immediately before my own” ;
and draws a distinction peculiarly
characteristic of these days; “On no
occasion would any man of my genera-
tion have broached an intimate idea to
Henry James, or to Thomas Hardy,
0.M., or, years since, to Swinburne, or
even to Mr. Yeats with any feeling that
the said idea was likely to be received,
grasped, comprehended. However much
one may have admired Yeats’s poetry ;
however much one may have been ad-
monished by Henry James’s prose works,
one has never thought of agreeing with
either. You could, on the other hand,
have said to Gourmont anything that
came into your head; you could have
sent him anything you had written with
a reasonable assurance that he would
have known what you were driving at.”
He next compresses into less than
seven pages his main theories of the
technic of verse-writing, beginning with
the famous “Im agist” principles:
(1) Direct treatment of the “thing”
whether subjective or objective.
(2) To use absolutely no word that
does not contribute to the presentation.
(3) As regarding rhythm: to compose
in the sequence of the musical phrase,
not in sequence of a metronome.
He goes on to some very practical ob-
servations of what to do and what not
to do.
The last essay is on. Cavalcanti, a labor
of love, in which his learning takes him
into all kinds of obscure Christian
theologies, and this because Cavalcanti’s
Ezra: Gaudier-Brzeska head.
philosophical attitude is to him most
acceptable, a polite and scientific heresy
expressed in gracious verse. He discusses
only one of Cavalcanti’s poems, “Donna
Mi Prega.” His translation of it is again
rather leaden, but as a discussion of hdw
the pentameter line may be varied, with
inner rhymes, to obtain lyrical effects it
is tremendous, and the philosophical
issues are, no doubt, very carefully and
profoundly resolved.
I am afraid this review has something
too much of Pound’s inconsequence and
fragmentariness ; but the book is full of
so many good things that to suggest them
all quickly one can scarcely avoid con-
fusion. To pass judgment op them is
not my ability, nor my purpose. Per-
haps the most charming thing about his
writing is the soft porcelain glaze it has,
from which criticism slides away as
though it were the traditional soft
answer.

Letters from
Joseph Furphy
Some time after
The Bulletin
published Such Is
Life I had the
good fortune to
be introduced by
letter to the author, Grant Hervey per-
forming the office. I never met Joseph
Furphy in the flesh (nor Grant Hervey,
either, for that matter); but near the be-
ginning of this century we kept up a
correspondence, and after many years a
number of his letters have again come
into my possession.
Furphy was an excellent correspon-
dent. He gave the impression that he
enjoyed writing letters— -otherwise, why
should he write regularly to a mere youth
(as I then was) epistles often funning to
six and eight large pages? He cdnfessec
to a “liking for preaching to defenceless
friends,” and there would appear truth
in the jest.
With the, letters in hand there can be
no chronological sequence, Furphy
rarely knew the date apparently; he
would write : “Monday Night” or “Tues-
day (date unknown and immaterial).”
Only one or two have the year stated.
From one of these (Sept. 23, ’03) we can
gain an idea of “Tpm Collins”: —
There is much in your suggestion respecting
the causes of pessimism in the outback man
(who is the real Australian); but, as you say,
ignorance is at the root of it. Does anyone
suppose that Unbroken prosperity is good for
a man or a nation? No one, I think; anc
the inability to apply the rule to one’s sel
personally is one manifestation of ignorance.
Says Lawson: ■ —
The generous hearts of the world, we find,
Thrive best on the barret) sod.
And the selfish thrive where Nature’s kind
(They’d bully, or crawl to, God!)
Now a man doesn’t need; to be a psalm-sing-
ing sneak to admit that beyond the material
elements of life, beyond the minerals, plants and
animals, beyond the changing seasons, and so
forth, there lies a purpose; We don’t know
definitely what this purpose may be; but I
don’t think it is fulfilled by ‘plethoric banking
accounts. Same time, I believe it is fulfilled by
the production of men and women of high
moral standard, calm courage and clear intel-
lect. To my mind, the pessimist is simply a
man who errs in his interpretation of Nature.
In the same letter Furphy speaks of his
literary work and tells how Such Is Life
came to be written: —
One thing I can say for myself—I write
only of what I know. You wouldn’t catch me
laying a scene in Russia or Brazil, nor under-
taking a society story. I have “cium” kurra-
jongs till the soles of my boots had to be
tied on, sandal-wise, with strips of hide.
I know the smell of gidya after a shower;
and I have liberated scores of sheep caught
by the shank in the fork of an emu-bush. I
have swum the cold fioodwater of the Lach-
lan, and have gone bullock-hunting (in the

altogether) on the other side. I have duffed
in the most sacred padocks....
Honestly, however, I take no credit what-
ever for S’Life, though I am pleased beyond
measure by its favorable reception A
few years ago, finding myself, for the first
time in my life, with 16 hours off out of the
24 and being constitutionally indifferent to
what is called amusement, I bethought me ot
writing a yarn. Before this was finished,
another motif had suggested itself—then another
—and another. And I made a point of loosely
federating these yarns (if you understand me);
till by-and-bye the scheme of S Life sug-
gested itself. Then I selected and altered and
largely rewrote seven of these stories, until
they came out as you see. S’Life represents
a good deal less than half of the Munchausen-
isms referred to. But the plan of the book
mustn’t be repeated; hence the next —now
finished, bar a little revision—will (please the
pigs) appear as a solid yarn, cut up into
XXXVI chapters, each headed by a fairly apt
motto, and the lot entitled Rigby’s Romance .
....Any Australian publisher—if the “B.’
should spurn the typewritten script out on its
ear—can have R’s. R. at a fortnight’s notice,
with my solemn guarantee that it is a much less
contemptible work than S’Life.
Regarding his belief in a “purpose,”
Furphy later remarked:
My own Sunday-school conceptions of
heaven, hell, the judgment day, etc., have long
ago gone by the board, and without affecting
my sense of right and wrong in the slightest
degree.
Politically, he leaned strongly to Social-
ism. He prophesied thus:
The time is hurrying on when all Democrats
will be Socialists, and all Conservatives Indi-
vidualists. There will be only one line of
cleavage in society. Though I believe the ele-
vation and advancement of our race to be
dependent upon a continually developing
Socialism, I am in no hurry. All that con-
cerns me is to do my little best honestly and
fearlessly. And the only reason I have for
wishing to see R’s. R. in circulation is that
the major’s arguments (by the time I have
done with them) won’t leave the Christian-
Individualist a feather to fly with.
Furphy did not write a line for print
till he was past 40. But from boyhood
he must have spent every available
moment in reading. He confessed to “a
modest ambition to know everything,”
and probably no Australian of the period
came nearer to a realisation of that am-
bition. For ordinary entertainments he
cared nothing:
My idea of dissipation [he wrote in one
letter] is to revel in some new volume of one
of my favorite sciences—ethnology or astro-
nomy. Also, I have a weakness for history,
ancient or modern; and in my untruthful
moments I claim to know off by heart all the
poetry in the English language. But here I
might shock you: can’t stand Wordsworth or
Browning at any price; admire a very small
portion of Tennyson ; love Longfellow, mostly
all; think Milton was overpaid with £lO for
Paradise Lost; have carried pocket editions
of Shakspeare all through Upper Riverina, for
reading by firelight. Respecting Australian
poets, my favorite is Lawson I think more
of Gordon than Kendall; but, strange to say,
Gordon’s great drawback is his ignorance.
He spoke frequently of Lawson:
Now if Lawson’s feminine sensitiveness had
been reinforced by masculine strength, we
wouldn’t be speaking of him in the past tense.
But outside his orbit of thought and feeling
there stretched a domain of reason that he
never explored. His splendid defect was over-
originality. He was content to forego his heir-
ship of all the ages. And to a chivalrous, un-
selfish mind the present is unendurable except
as a link connecting a worse past with a
better future. Lawson lived too much in the
present. However, he leaves the world his
debtor. He has done work that will be better
appreciated by the next generation than this;
and any censure of his literary personality sug-
gests a crushing retort.
The names of many Australian writers
of the period appear in these letters, with
Furphy’s opinions of them or of their
work: Edward Dyson (“I have met few
men who stand as high in my esteem”),
Bernard O’Dowd (“He is an ideal demo-
crat —able and scholarly, strong and sym-
pathetic, temperate and uncompromising,
absolutely without fear and without re-
proach”), Paterson, Ogilvie, A. G.
Stephens, Frank Myers, Steve O’Brien,
R. J. Cassidy, J. F, Dwyer, Herbert Rie-
mann and many others.
Furphy was enthusiastic over My Bril-
liant Career and its author:
Miles Franklin is the sort of woman that
we ought to be proud of; though her book
has been cut to pieces in the editing, I don’t
know anything in Australian literature which
can surpass the closing pages in style and senti-
ment. And be sure there is more where that
came from.
“Tom Collins” mentioned her in several
letters, and I feel sure Miss Franklin will
herself appreciate this criticism of her
personal appearance : —
She is rather above middle height; slight,
symmetrical and with the action of a grey-
hound. But there is no mistake about that
mighty cable of treacle-brown hair. From the
top of the head to the middle of the nose she
is more than beautiful —she is glorious; and
from the parting of the lips -to the footpath
she is like “the bending statue that enchants
the world.” But the intermediate two inches
is aboriginal, except in color. Same time,
when she talks (which, by the way, is continu-
ously), and the play of thought illuminates her
face, you wouldn’t have one feature altered for
the world.
Furphy mentioned the young lady’s
“Bangalore laugh” and also her habit of
stepping round in front of a companion
when she had said a good thing—“and
this before the G.P.O. in Melbourne,
with 50 decorous citizens looking on.”
Finally he supplied a fashion note: —
For the satisfaction of your lady friends,
I may mention that Miles wore a frock of
black glazed calico, faced with white, and a
black sheepskin belt. She wore a broad,,
smooth collar, like what you and I had to wear
at seven years old; and her hat was fastened
on by a long pin, stuck through her head.
There are many criticisms of Furphy’s
contemporaries scattered throughout the
pages of these letters, as well as a state-
ment of his attitude towards spiritualism ;
much regarding his dealings with The
Bulletin people when Such Is Life was
being prepared for publication (it was
at first intended to have the work illus-
trated) ; advice to young writers, and a
great deal of other material that should
interest lovers of Australian literature.
For instance, speaking of city writers and
artists he said: —
It would be the salvation of any of these
men to take out a season in Riverina, with
“Matilda” for a companion. It is pathetic to
see, in Lambert’s fine picture “Across the
Black-soil Plains,” that his wool waggon is a
magnified lorry, that he has no levers on the
ropes, and (if the wool is greasy) about nine
tons on 13 horses, with the tracks axle-deep.
We talked over these things one night —half a
dozen of us —in Stephens’s lodgings; and I’ll
never forget the eager, hungry interest of those
town fellows in anything connected with the
grand silent expanses which you and I know
so well.
Speaking of Bulletin notabilities of
his day, he regretted missing James Ed-
mond on a visit to Sydney, Edmond
being on holiday in Melbourne at the
time, and added: —
But I got quite thick with Archibald, Mont-
gomery, A.G.S., Dorrington, Norman Lind-
say and Daley. Also, I fraternised with
William Macleod, who is as intellectual, witty
and genial as any of the rest. All the “B.”
staff have one thing in common, viz., baldness.
Yet, even apart from association, they are the
finest-looking lot of men you would see
together. Montgomery is one of the hand-
somest men I ever set eyes on.
Furphy sent me letters received from
other literary people at times —without,
of course, anything of a purely private
nature in them. One such may be
quoted. It was from A.G.S., and accom-
panied a Red Page rejection: —
I find Tennyson MS. labored and flat, and
dislike the intrusion of so many pompous poly-
syllables. Returned. “Take that, ye
divvle ! ! !” as Brunton Stephens wrote to me
on occasion.
I believe Furphy’s work will yet receive
the recognition its merit warrants, that
the big-hearted philosopher, humorist,
bushlover will be regarded as one of the
most important figures in Australian
literature.

Another
Battalion
History
The Thirty-
ninth (Green and
Sons, Me 1 b.;
price not stated),
by Lieut.-Colonel
Paterson, D. 5.0.,
M.C., with forewords by Generals Bird-
wood, Monash and White.
This history of the 10th Brigade’s Bal-
larat battalion is largely the work of a
volunteer publication committee. Its
efforts have been assembled and edited
by the fine soldier who took over when
Henderson, the battalion’s original C. 0.,
was killed shortly before the Armistice.
There are few battalion histories so
impressive as regards format, and scat-
tered through its 371 pages are 11 maps
and many photographs and drawings.
But then the committee began with a
subscribed publication fund of £6OO.
Histories of the sort keep appearing,
and they always sell. To thousands of
men and women the war was the acutest
emotional experience of their lives. It
left them with a nostalgic interest in the
tiny areas they had known so well, and
an insatiable curiosity as to what they
looked like at different stages of the
fighting. So countless soldiers, British and
Australian, who never knew anybody in
the Thirty-ninth are likely to be fas-
cinated by its story.
For example, everybody who served on
the Somme knows the narrow road wind-
ing down from the Amiens-Bapaume
road to Hielly. The Thirty-ninth reached
it in March, 1918, to find the surround-
ing fields full of gas ; Hielly was being
shelled, and the villagers were fleeing.
At Ribemont, a couple of miles further
on,
Strong barricades had been thrown across
the village streets, and ' carts and hay
waggons had been pulled across the roads.
The battalion went into action that even-
ing near Mericourt at a time when
“poison-gas fumes drenched the sur-
rounding villages.” Yet the Second Divi-
sion arrived from the Ypres sector a few
weeks later to find Hielly relatively safe.
Also Ribemont. Men went champagne-
souveniring in Mericourt and swim-
ming in the Ancre ; there were no hostile
Germans nearer than Buire.
Similarly on the other front. Neuve
Eglise, though a home from home to
the Thirty-ninth—the scene of sporting
contests and concerts —had been a hell
on earth to other A.I.F. units, and it was
a hell again in the late spring of 1918
when the Germans surged up through
Armentieres on their way to Kemmel.
These unpretentious histories touch
the hearts of ex-soldiers of all nationali-
ties not only as intimate records of brave
men, but of lovely places that have lived
and died. To think that the Bailleul
square once existed in ancient beauty,
that a fifteenth-century church stood in
Dranoutre, that there were old trees in
the woods above Querrieu! One re-
members these lost things like lost com-
rades.
A feature of The Thirty-ninth which
the writer doesn’t remember to have
seen elsewhere is a complete nominal roll
of the battalion, with casualties. Of the
officers and other ranks whose names
began with A, 33 out of 91 were killed
or wounded. And the A’s got off lightly.
A page of G’s shows 26 killed or wounded
out of 40.

A Choice of Verse:—
CROWD.
Each of this salt and sullen mass has once
Felt suddenly, desperately individual,
And, mad to lose that loneliness, has plunged
Bac\ to the sea, at smothering flesh has plunged
With a hot mouth, with a wild call.
Each of these has once been singled out
As one miraculous, a million suns,
Green jewels and rubies, more strange than words
could spea\,
And so adored has answered sic\ with doubt:
“1 hnoiv you not; and l am not unique.
I am no different at all.”
So now, a single mass, the ran\, dan\ waves
Roar from the hollow building and divide
In two dar\ swirls, and merge, and onward surge,
And roaring come, and split, and onward surge,
A headlong ocean, a blind tide.
Standing defiant, the roc\ on which it shatters,
l remember: each has been called more strange than
mountains,
Each is alone, and each must die, must die!
Each of that sea where the traffic screams and clatters
Must fight his fellows or follow; or stand as I,
Stocfstill, and grinning with a hard pride.
VICTORIA.
DOUGLAS A. STEWART.
A Satchel of Books
The Fortune of the Sands, by James
Lorimer (Blackwood ; 7s. 6d.). Belongs
to the Treasure Island genus, but the
yarn has been got up for slightly more
adult readers. There is less gore, and
a heroine has been introduced as a con-
cession to popular taste ; the sentiments
are quite the same.
The Bubble Galleon (Angus and
Robertson; 4s. 6d.). The story by
Ernest Wells, the drawings by Coulter,
this is not a mere Christmas-season offer-
ing—it is a fine present for boys for ail
the year round. Unlike most of its kind,
the yarn is a really good one for boys,
cleanly told.
John Hampson, who wrote Saturday
Night at the Greyhound, goes back to
drab industrial England in Strip Jack
Naked (Heinemann ; 7s. 6d.), the story
of an attachment between two brothers
and its dissolution through the elder’s
affair with a factory girl. On the elder’s
death, the younger throws off his in-
feriority complex, assumes the executive
traits of the other and finally, from a
sense of duty, marries his brother’s girl.
The author knows his types and their
grimy surroundings.
My Army Life, by the Earl of Dun-
donald (Arnold; 7s. 6d.), a reprint of
the original published in 1926, is the old
story of the trained soldier frustrated
by the amateur who, by reason of his
political authority, is able to thwart the
professional at every step. Dundonald
was a grandson of that military and
naval genius who is best remembered as
the champion of the South American
republics against Spanish rule. A Life
Guardsman, the author served with dis-
tinction in the Sudan
and the Boer War ;
he commanded
Buffer’s mo u n ted
forces in Natal, and
was the first man to
ride into relieved
Lad y s m ith. Pro-
moted to Major-
General, he accepted
the job of reorganis-
ing the Canadian
forces. His story of
the nepotism, self-in-
terest and corruption
against which he
battled in vain reads
like an extract from
any recent memoirs
of the Great War re-
counting the enmity
between the soldiers
and the politicians.
A final vigorous pro-
test against the treat-
ment handed out to
him brought his dis-
missal. Back in
England, the Gov-
ernment promoted
him to Lieut.-Gen-
eral. It never gave
him another job,
however, and after
two years’ half pay
he aut o m atically
dropped out of the
service.

BACK TO PROVINCIALISM.
The most disappointing and disturbing
feature of latter-day Australian politics
is the return to provincialism. The
Swanland secession movement is only
one expression of it; provincialists
have started up again in all the
States, and in the fourth decade of
the Commonwealth are “putting over”
things which in the first decade they
would not have dared to attempt.
Sometimes the provincial spirit takes
ludicrous forms. For example, three
States run lotteries, and each calls the
others’ lotteries “foreign,” and punishes
its own citizens if they are caught gamb-
ling in the “foreign” lotteries while
encouraging the foreigners to gamble in
its own. But aN. S. Welshman draw-
ing income from “foreign” Victoria finds
nothing to laugh at when he is taxed lOd.
in the £ by the Sydney Government,
regardless of what he has paid on it to
the Victorian and Commonwealth Gov-
ernments. Nor is a Victorian citizen
moved to mirth when he is penalised by
the Melbourne Government for drawing
income—already taxed three or four
times —from N. S. Wales.
This has been going on for years. It is
utterly against the spirit of the Com-
monwealth Constitution, and so is the
arrangement recently arrived at whereby
N. S. Wales alone taxes the Victorian in-
come of N.S.W. residents and Victoria
alone the N.S.W. income of Victorians ;
but the Commonwealth Government
does not interfere. Nor has it interfered
to prevent N. S. Wales prohibitively taxing
Victorian motor-lorries carrying goods
into the Riverina, though Section 92 of
the .Constitution insists that “Trade, com-
merce and intercourse among the States,
whether by means of internal carriage or
ocean navigation, shall be absolutely
free.”.
Another section, 90, gives the Com-
monwealth Parliament “exclusive” power
to impose duties of customs and excise.
Westralia gets over this by levying port
dues so high that in one year, 1929-30,
the Fremantle Harbor Trust showed a
surplus of £200,500 over working ex-
penses, interest and sinking fund, the
bulk of which was transferred to the
State Treasury. Queensland, besides
closing its wheat market against growers
in other States, unless there happens to
be a shortage of Queensland wheat, de-
lights in stinging Sydney and Melbourne
concerns which establish Queensland
branches. Thus the publisher of a maga-
zine with an Australian circulation of,
say, 60,000 copies who sells 10,000 in
Queensland is regarded in Brisbane as
having earned one-sixth of his income
in Queensland and taxed accordingly,
though his Queensland transactions may
not really show a profit. Taxgatherers
from Queensland empowered to impose
arbitrary taxes, no matter what is taken
from the victims by their home State
and the Commonwealth, periodically
descend on head offices in other States.
Still, in the art of impeding the growth
of Australia-wide businesses Queensland,
it must be acknowledged, has nothing to
learn from N. S. Wales.
Mephan Ferguson’s experience is illu-
minating. This old Victorian pipe-mak-
ing concern was asked to tender for
pipes needed by the N.S.W. Water Board.
The invitation came from the board’s
own president and engineer, who visited
the Mephan Ferguson factory in Mel-
bourne and inspected pipes being sup-
plied to the Melbourne Board of Works.
The firm put in a tender which was
lower by £12,000 than the lowest of the
N.S.W. tenders, and provided for quicker
delivery, it also undertook to make the
pipes in the Sydney suburb of Concord,
buying the land, putting up buildings and
plant and employing N.S.W. labor. The
board accepted Mephan Ferguson’s
tender. Premier Stevens, whose Govern-
ment is advancing the money from relief-
work funds, interposed a veto, on the
ground that contracts must be restricted
to residents of N. S. Wales. No small
portion of the relief-work funds is ob-
tained by the taxation of income from
Victoria, thrice taxed already, but that
is evidently immaterial to Mr. Stevens.
For this resurgence of provincialism
the Commonwealth Government is
greatly to blame. Whether it calls
itself Nationalist, Labor or U.A.P.-
U.C.P. it never strikes a strong
national note; never stands up for the
rights of Commonwealth citizens when
they are assailed by State Governments ;
never resolves to end duplication and
mend the Constitution —demonstrably a
most defective instrument of government
by going after a new grant of power.
It is smugly satisfied with a distribu-
tion of functions which gives it an in-
ordinate share of the tax-revenue wrung
from a people with a plethora of politi-
cians and public employees, and enables
it to indulge its odd notion that the way
to solve problems is to appoint royal
commissions to burble about them, and
the way to remove discontent with
bad government is to shovel out special
grants.
THE NEXT G.-G.
The question of the retirement of Gov-
ernor-General Isaacs was raised in the
first place by Sydney’s New Guard, which
wants the King to appoint a royal duke
in place of an Australian.
In accordance with a recently-estab-
lished principle, the King has no initiative
in the matter. He acts on the advice of
his Ministers in Canberra, as he does on
that of his Ministers in London.
No one who is anxious for the pre-
servation of the present happy relations
between Australians and members of
the royal family, and who recog-
nises the constitutional and social differ-
ences between Australia and the U.K.,
wants to see a royal duke as Governor-
General in the trying years ahead.
The Commonwealth is a Federation,
and one result is that the King’s repre-
sentative has constantly to deal with
problems which turn on fine points of
constitutional law. Under the British
system the head of the State is never
involved in party rows; here circum-
stances may make it impossible for him
to escape them.
The career of Sir Philip Game is a case
in point. He began by doing what he
considered the right thing by the Lang
Government, and got himself so disliked
by the other side that many Nationalists
stopped going to Government House.
Duty called for a decision which led to
Lang Labor being put out of office, and
Sir Philip Game has been attacked ever
since by Mr, Lang’s paper as an enemy
of half the population of N. S. Wales.
The Government entertained him at a
farewell party at Parliament House. The
Lang party boycotted it.
Governor-General Isaacs has been a
success because he began his term at
Canberra with as much experience of
Australian men and affairs as King
George has now of British and Continen-
tal men and affairs and as Queen Victoria
had in the same sphere after 40 years on
the throne. These permanent civil ser-
vants in excelsis know more than the
Ministers who are their theoretical ad-
visers, and the Ministers watch their steps
accordingly. A youthful royalty, how-
ever charming he may be personally,
however well he dances and rides, would
be singularly ill qualified to cope with
our politicians. He would have neither
the knowledge nor that prestige which
can only be gained in any walk of life by
long service.
There are many reasons why the next
Governor-General should be an Austra-
lian. Before the war an aristocratic
figurehead from England was appro-
priate as the Crown’s representative in
a Dominion. Now, in the terms of a
recent Imperial Conference declaration,
the component parts of the Empire are
“in no way subordinate one to another
in any respect of their domestic or exter-
nal affairs.” South Africa concludes a
trade treaty with Germany which may
have unfavorable repercussions on our
wool industry ; Canada sends an Ambas-
sador to Washington; Britain takes
Argentine meat in preference to ours. It
doesn’t mean that the Empire is breaking
up ; merely that the nations are becom-
ing increasingly interdependent. We will
get the benefits of Empire unity in the
priceless matter of defence provided we
do our share, but our trade will have to
look after itself to a great extent.
What Australian has sufficient brains,
force of character, prestige and know-
ledge of Australia and the people with
whom Australia trades to follow the
present Governor-General? One man
stands out —Chauvel. His political views
are unknown. He has a reputation for
honesty and patriotism that no politi-
cian or politician’s newspaper could
undermine, and, in any case, he is one of
those rare beings who don’t make a mis-
take in a blue moon. For his work as
leader of the Desert Column and the
Desert Mounted Corps he would be an
inspiration to soldiers and ex-soldiers all
over the world ; but from an Australian
standpoint his qualification is simply that
he is Chauvel.
OUR OWN MOTOR FUEL.
Motor fuel was one of the first major
subjects to which the C.S.I.R. gave atten-
tion. In a bulletin published in 1918
it pointed out that, although Australia
had been able to secure supplies of
mineral oils sufficient for her needs, “the
increasing shortage of shipping and the
large demands for petrol in connection
with the war” meant that we “might at
any time be thrown on our own re-
sources for supplies of liquid fuel.”
Fortunately,
As opposed to her deficiencies in supply
of natural oil fuels, Australia has the
necessary elements for the production of raw
materials which can be used as a source for
the manufacture of alcohol in those
crops which contain sugar and starch.
From these alcohol can be produced in
annual rotation in inexhaustible supplies.
It was further stressed that “the manu-
facture of power-alcohol is likely to
play an important or even essential part
in a complete agricultural policy” and
that “alcohol can be used with entire
success in internal-combustion engines.”
Nine years later, the C.S.I.R. was still
harping on the same string. Petrol was
about 2s. a gallon then (it had been 3s.
6d. a gallon towards the end of the war).
The world boom was reaching its height.
The U.S.A., producing two-thirds of the
world’s mineral oil and having expanded
its production by 130 p.c. in six years,
was Seriously considering prohibition of
export.
Countries began to look to their local
resources—all except Australia, which
slumbered on peacefully, meanwhile
allowing a natural restriction in agri-
cultural products which might have been
turned to account in producing fuel.
Motor vehicles increasingly put horses
out of work, and, where there are fewer
horses, less grain and hay are grown. In
U.S.A. it was estimated three years ago
that the countryside had been denuded of
6,000,000 people by the growth of motor
transport.
Australian maize production in its
peak year before the war—l9lo-11—was
equal to 2948 bushels per 1000 of popu-
lation. Export then was only 121,000
bushels ; there was 415,000 acres under
crop. In 1930 there was only 297,000
acres under crop, production had fallen
to 1241 bushels per 1000 of population
and exports were negligible, as before.
Some other agricultural products for
which there is no export market have
been going the same way. Yet every 40
bushels of maize is capable of produc-
ing from 80 to 90 gallons of pure alcohol.
Wheat grain yields about the same; sor-
ghum a little more. Sugar, arrowroot,
potatoes, cassava, barley are all distill-
able, and the process has numerous by-
products, including “dry ice,” acetone,
yeast and glycerine.
Various countries already produce
motor spirit from local vegetable pro-
ducts. In Italy the process is well ad-
vanced. In Austria all motor spirit offered
for sale has to contain 24 p.c. alcohol
of Austrian origin. A Congressional
Committee in the Argentine favors 30
p.c., and a bill is before Congress to make
the recommendation legal. In Hungary,
20 p.c. alcohol in petrol is compulsory.
The French Government is marketing a
50 p.c. mixture. Germany produced
about 120,000,000 gallons of power-
alcohol in 1932.
The only Australian State to move so
far is Queensland, There an Act was
passed obliging all persons selling motor
spirit to take out licenses and to
purchase at a prescribed price a quantity
of power-alcohol manufactured in Aus-
tralia
in proportion to total purchases of motor
spirit. The Minister was given power
to fix blending proportions. The opera-,
tion of this Act was held up by a High
Court decision that it infringed the Aus-
tralian Constitution. An amending bill
passed last session seems to have got
over the trouble ; at all events, a con-
ference with the petrol companies has
been held.
Production of alcohol from vegetable
products needs no huge individual out-
lay of capital. A factory to yield about
3,000,000 gallons p.a. can, on the experi-
ence of U.S.A., S’Africa and Germany,
be built for about £50,000. A. W.
Fadden, M.L.A., of Queensland, has esti-
mated the cost of establishing a large-
scale industry with 131 distilleries, inclu-
sive ot preparation of additional land
and the cost of producing raw materials
at £27,000,000 —roughly the import value
of years’ petrol supply. The pro-
ducers’ net return he reckons at £4 10s.
to £7 per acre. Two distilleries are beinq
organised already—one in the Lockyer
and one on the Atherton Tableland.
It is not proposed that the Common-
wealth Government should find the
£27,000,000 or anything like it. All the
same, a project that would assist agri-
culture, promote employment and lessen
our dependence on overseas petrol sup-
plies seems worthier of its attention than
another long list of public works which
“absorb the unemployed” so briefly and
leave so much taxation in their train.
NON-INTERFERENCE.
Australia has a distinct interest in the
Franco-Italian pact under which France
has made concessions to Italy in North
Africa, while both nations (and also,
according to the “Popolo di Roma,”
Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czecho-Slovakia,
Poland and Roumania) have agreed to
preserve the status quo in Austria.
The agreement may not please Hitler,
who wishes to bring all Europe’s
85,000,000 German-speaking people into
the Reich ; and it certainly won’t please
the colored nationalists of North Africa,
who mean to experiment with self-gov-
ernment if they ruin their native lands in
the process. On the other hand, it should
make for peace among Europeans of
goodwill, and for sound government on
the southern side of the Mediterranean.
Home Rule for everybody has an in-
spiring sound, but it doesn’t work among
races which come under the sway of
brigands the moment their alien rulers
get out.
The world will never achieve disarma-
ment, but it may well achieve as much
disarmament as was proposed by the
Japanese Ambassador recently (“an
armament formula making it diffi-
cult for any Power to attack another but
easy to defend itself”); and the Franco-
Italian pact shows the way. Its aim is
to make potential belligerents satisfied,
if only for a few generations, with what
they have. The future welfare of Aus-
tralia may depend on a wide extension
of these pacts, based on the principle of
discouraging bids for places in the sun
by Powers which have no justification
for such bids except a desire for oil-
wells, goldmines or whatever it may be.
Australia’s interest in the creation of
a spirit of contentment in the chief Medi-
terranean countries —and in other coun-
tries on the air route to Darwin —is a
matter of its geographical position com-
bined with the probability that all mails
and many tourists will be carried in
’planes inside 10 years. The seas belong
to everybody outside the 12-mile
coastal limits imposed by most maritime
nations. The air is owned in sections by
the countries beneath it.
Some countries have subscribed to the
1919 Air Convention; some, such as
Russia and the U.S.A., have not. Sub-
scribers and non-subscribers retain the
right which they have under international
law to prevent aircraft from passing over
their territories. This right has been
exercised by Governments on absurdly
trivial grounds.
Australia’s Kingsford Smith was for-
bidden to fly over Turkey before the cen-
tenary race on suspicion of having made
uncomplimentary remarks about Turkish
soldiers. The Persian Government began
by allowing the British to fly to India
along the north-east side of the Persian
Gulf, became aggrieved about some-
thing and withdrew the privilege, so that
the route had to be changed to the other
side of the gulf. Similar embargoes
exist in other parts of the Near East and
in Western Europe. The air traveller
to or from Australia must pass over half
a dozen foreign countries which, how-
ever considerate they may be to competi-
tors in races, are liable to be anything
but considerate towards regular air
services.
It means that Australia, which was
able to keep in touch with Britain all
through the World War, may be isolated
in peace-time when transport by sea gives
way to air transport.
The position is no argument in favor
of remaining in our present un-
defended state. Other things being equal,
armed nations are least likely to be dis-
criminated against by other nations. But
it is a hint to us to cultivate friends
where they may be needed in days to
come, and to transfer at least part of our
interest in international sport to inter-
national politics.
Non-interference pacts, based on the
good old rule that those who want to
keep out of trouble should mind their
own business, look like a cure for most
of the hatreds which are keeping the
Powers on tenterhooks.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Japan and Yampi Sound.
It is not to be believed that the Com-
monwealth Government will allow Jap-
anese interests to gain a grip over the
Yampi Sound (North Westraha) iron-
ore deposits. Japanese have shown an in-
terest in them for 15 years, off and on, but
negotiations have hitherto fallen through.
The present proposal, as outlined by
a Mr. Umeda, is that Japan should
finance the leaseholders through the
Nippon Industrial Co., which has a capi-
tal of £14,000,000, and does the largest
proportion of its business with the navy
and the Government. Having secured
financial control of the deposits, the com-
pany, which has sent to Australia one
of its leading mining engineers, together
with a civil engineer and business asso-
ciates, is willing to buy 1,000,000 tons
per annum.
To sell 1,000,000 tons of iron ore a
year is one thing, but to allow a foreign
nation to establish a hold on the mines
from which the ore comes —mines which
are fairly close to Australia’s northern
defensive base at Darwin —is quite an-
Other. • ,-11 T
The quantity which the Japanese pro-
pose to take out of Yampi is 300,000
tons more than Australian consump-
tion, which comes almost entirely
from South Australia, and double the
normal import of iron ore into Japan,
which hitherto has bought her metal as
pig and steel—about 2,000,000 tons per
annum. Once it leaves Australia the ore
will be treated by Japanese workmen for
Japanese uses. S.A. iron ore has a
higher manganese content than that at
Yampi, and it has an advantage in loca-
tion —the B.H.P. and other cos. operat-
ing in N. S. Wales can backload coal to
S.A., which has no native fuel supply.
It is estimated that the Yampi deposits
show 77,000,000 tons of hematite above
ground with a metal content of 65 p.c.,
and so placed that they can be quarried
and carried to the ship’s hold by gravita-
tion. Everything possible should be done
to open up Yampi and market its pro-
duct, but the investment of foreign capi-
tal there should be severely discouraged.
More especially since Admiral Mark
Kerr has suggested that Britain should
shift its Pacific base from spy-haunted
Singapore to North Westralia, which has
at least one fine natural harbor in
Napier Broome Bay.
♦ '
Truth and the Golden Jest.
The Bulletin learns from a “Hansard”
report published last week that during
the debate on the N. S. Wales Charitable
Collections Bill it was attacked by mem-
bers of the party responsible for interest-
default, the Savings Bank smash and the
introduction of “fruit machines” and
tin-hares. Describing The Bulletin
as the “genesis of this trouble” ii.e., the
bill), Mr. C. C. Lazzarini, a Golden Jest
committeeman, asserted that “we” gave
it an advertisement which “we valued
at about £3,” but for which £2O was
charged, “We gave no more.”
After we withdrew our business from
The Bulletin we became the victims of
the most bitter attacks, which were all part
of a dirty political ramp.
Mr. Clyne, another champion of
Golden Jest “art unions,” said:
When the advertisements were withdrawn
those articles appeared week by week.
Mr. Lang: It was blackmail!
Mr. Clyne. It was.
The facts are that The Bulletin has
refused all “art-union” and lottery-syndi-
cate advertising since June, 1933, when
it was warned from Victoria that publi-
cation of suph advertisements was against
the law of that State. The last Golden
Jest advertisement appeared on June 14,
1933 (the Deaf, Dumb and Blind organ-
isation had a larger advertisement in the
same issue, and the Royal Prince Alfred
Hospital a still larger one on June 21).
The space occupied was 11 inches, double-
column ; the charge was not £2O but £l6.
Mr. Lazzarini asserts that it was given
to a particular member of the literary
staff. He was not then on the paper.
The Bulletin’s campaign was in-
spired by the introduction of the Charit-
able Collections Bill. The opening article,
published on October 18, 1933, criticised
that measure, which has since been
altered for the better. The first mention
°f Golden Jest methods was made in an
article published on November 15, 1933.
So the references of Mr. Lazzarini and
Mr. Clyne to The Bulletin were a tissue
of falsehoods. By making them these
politicians qualified for admission to the

Slow-motion Police Work.
Inverloch is 95 miles from Melbourne,
and there is a good road all the way. A
gml of 13 was murdered there by a de-
generate during a public holiday. The
news was sent to Melbourne, and seven
hours after the report reached Russell-
street special officers and blacktrackers
appeared on' the scene.
This is not an extract from the “Port
Phillip Gazette” when it was edited by
the late Johnny Fawkner, or even from
some paper of a later date when the
Kelly Gang roamed the countryside and
the only means of transport was pro-
vided by Cobb and Co. It happened
about 15 days ago, in what is known as
the machine age, when cars can cover
100 miles an hour on the open road and
when aeroplanes can rise above Mel-
bourne until they see Inverloch awaiting
them on the horizon. But the police took
seven hours covering that 95 miles. Mel-
bourne is asking why.
- About the actual times connected with
the crime, there is a vast conflict of testi-
mony. Police officials themselves differ
by two hours regarding the time the
police car left Russell-street. But one
fact is undeniable ; seven hours elapsed
from the time the murder was reported
at headquarters to the time the detec-
tives arrived on the spot marked X.
Frequently the police are blamed for
delay without justification. It is not
always possible for them to explain the
reason for the apparent loss of time.
Their job is to fix the crime on the guilty
party, and they must not shift their eye
from their objective to defend them-
selves even though such defence may not
give the criminal a hint as to the line of
tactics they intend to pursue.
In this case no such excuse is possible.
The girl was found dead —not outraged,
but obviously killed by some man who
contemplated outrage. There were left no
clues worthy of the name ; there were
no persons with guilty knowledge whom
it was possible to put on “the grill.” The
police from the outset were up against a
wall, and there can be nothing in the
delay of seven hours which, by any
stretch of imagination, can be con-
strued into a belief that they were mak-
ing important inquiries elsewhere. The
whole matter calls for explanation, and
full explanation at that.

In Defence of Monash.
From one of his men: —•
Tell “P.S.C.” (B. 26/12/’34) that Monash
was not in command of the Corps at the de-
fence of Villers-Bret., and that he did order
the attack on Mont St. Quentin. “Pompey’
Elliott’s crossing of the Somme was rendered
possible only by the victory of Mont St.
Quentin and the capture of Peronne.
The battle of Mont St. Quentin began
on August 31, 1918. Two days previously, be-
fore the Somme had been reached, Monash
called all his divisional commanders to Proyart.
The notes he used at the conference are printed
on pages 178-9 of his first book; they show
conclusively that his was the plan for turning
the line of the Somme by an attack to the
north-east through Mont St. Quentin and Bou-
chavesnes. Each division was given an immedi-
ate and an ultimate objective.
Monash fed his troops on victory, a food for
which they had starved; and the troops knew
whose hand fed them. When he took over on
May 30 his men had seen the defeat of a British
army; their morale —“never higher,” according
to “P.S.C.” —was affected by a failing confi-
dence in other portions of the army and a
future that seemed to offer no early prospect of
final victory. Hamel and August 8 (the August
8 plan was Monash’s) changed all that. On
May 30 the Corps could not have taken Mont
St. Quentin. After August 8 anything was
possible. The leader had found the men, and
the men, at long last, had found the leader.
Monash had every right to criticise other
troops. Is truth to be suppressed? Is history
to be merciful at the expense of truth? On
this subject the A.I.F. spoke far more strongly
than Monash wrote.
Unified Freight-rates.
The Premiers are next month to discuss
the unification of Australian railway
gauges at a cost jocularly estimated at
£21,000,000. It would be more to the
point if they turned their attention to uni-
fication of railway freight-rates. The last
Commonwealth report on the subject
gave many examples of the freakish
humor of authors who write railway rate-
books. It cost £7 7s. 3d. a ton to freight
butter from Adelaide to Kalgoorlie, and
£lO 13s. lOd. from Orroroo to Kal-
goorlie—l 77 miles less.
The per-ton rates Sydney and Mel-
bourne to Wagga (N.S.W.) were:
Sydney Melbourne
(325 miles). (269 miles).
Wheat 17/4 25/8
Super 10/4 16/4
Wool £4/16/11 £5/7/4
Wire £2/5/5 £2/15/8
Galvanised Iron £3/15/8 £5/8/6
Border transhipping charges were Is. 9d.
a ton on everything except wool, 2s. 4d.
per ton —it is the rule in all railway
departments to take it out of wool. So
it was “apparent that the break of gauge
at Albury did not account for the dis-
parity.”
From Melbourne, 273 miles, to Kaniva
(Vie.), the wire-netting rate was 225. 5d.;
from Adelaide to Kaniva, 209 miles, 465.
Id. Wire-netting inspires railway man-
agements to perhaps their choicest efforts
in the comic line. From Brisbane to
Glen Innes, 292 miles, the charge p.t. is
745. 7d.; from Sydney to Glen Innes,
424 miles, it is 335. 9d. As for the
struggle between Sydney and Adelaide
for the Broken Hill trade, the N.S.W.
department, while complimenting itself
on its success in keeping its 1933-34
deficit down to £3,388,100, complains of
the “strikingly preferential rating” which
makes it “possible to consign goods from
Sydney to Adelaide and land them in
Broken Hill for less than the legitimate
freight-rate between Sydney and Broken
Hill.” . .
While this sort of thing goes on, it is
idle to imagine that unification of gauges,
adding £BOO,OOO to an interest bill which
already eats up about 7s. of every £1
collected for goods and passenger car-
riage, would benefit the public by cheap-
ening rates.
♦
Bread Goes Up.
As usual, the entry of the flour tax has
started the ancient game of passing the
buck. In all States the trade is trying to
put a halfpenny on the 21b. loaf. “Every
rise or fall of £1 7s. 6d. in the. ton-price
of flour or of 13.2 d. in the bushel-price
of wheat should,” it is said, “mean a
change of in the price of a 21b.
loaf.” The figure was arrived at by a
Victorian Commission three years ago
when flour was £ll per ton. But the
experience of most consumers is that the
price of bread is swift to rise and slow
to fall.
The result of the advance in four States
may be summarised thus:
Flour Price,
Inc. Tax. New Bread Price.
Melbourne £9 15 0 4-id. delivered
Brisbane £ll 2 6 sd. delivered
Adelaide £lO 2 6 4d. shop, 4id. delivered
Perth ..£ll 2 6 4id. shop, sd. delivered
Brisbane has not only a higher flour
price than other States except W.A., but
a substantially heavier average wage
rate than other States.
The adjustment of flour tax is ad-
mittedly difficult. Not passed on to the
bread-buyer, it creates a disparity be-
tween the countryman who bakes his
own bread and has to carry the excise
directly, and the city householder who
does not. Passed on, however, it con-
stitutes a tax which becomes harder in
proportion to the taxpayer’s poverty and
family responsibilities.
The fight has been hottest in N. S.
Wales. The Sydney master bakers, whose
flour price, including tax, is £lO 2s. 6d.,
attempted to increase the shop price by
id. to sd.—nominally 4|d., but farthings
don’t circulate in Sydney. A lot of
bakers ignored the decree, and the
Government stepped in with a proclama-
tion restricting the price over the coun-
ter to 4|d. Legal action was threatened
by the trade ; it has been suspended pend-
ing the result of an inquiry by Herbert
Gepp.
«
Leaving the Door Unbolted.
There is only one way to cope with
sporadic incursions of insect pests, and
that is by going back to nature. Poison
baits are at best a poor palliative, and
in the result they reduce the only effec-
tive means of making such pests inno-
cuous. The one trustworthy method of
destroying deleterious insect life is by en-
couraging the presence of insectivorous
birds.
This applies to grasshoppers and to
blowflies also. The loss in wool and
meat inflicted on Australia annually
through the blowfly is astounding, and it
is quite possible that, had there been no
rabbit pest to poison, sufficient birds
would have been left living to clear the
blowflies out of country districts alto-
gether. The use of the poison bait has
wrought havoc with Australia’s bird life,
and we are to-day reaping the harvest in
devastated crops and reduced wool and
meat cheques. It is not that the birds
would fight the mature blowfly and the
mature grasshopper; they would feast
on them in the larval stage and leave few
to come to maturity to perpetuate their
species.
There should be no relaxation of the
researches of entomologists ; the success
of Cactoblastis in Queensland prickly-
pear areas proves the value of such
work. But, as an adjunct to the effort's
of scientists to discover a parasite which
will kill the grasshopper and the blow-
fly, the direct action of bird life must be
encouraged and the use of the poison
bait, either for rabbits or for insect pests,
minimised to its lowest point. Australia
faces blowflies all the time, but the
attacks of grasshoppers are sporadic, and
for that reason are apt to be forgotten
between sorties. But nature works on
such eccentric lines that next year the
trouble may be with beetles, and the year
following with earthworms. The bird
is the only defender which carries the
weapon to deal with the lot.
Art and the U.S.S.R.
Katharine Prichard, who has been in
Russia, told the Fellowship of Australian
writers and Herr Egon Kisch last week
that' Australia was “culturally back-
ward.”
I found that the young working people
of the vSoviet Union were much more
advanced culturally in music and art than
the majority of even our middle-class
people.
The artiness of the Russians, like that
of the Chinese and other proletarian
races, has been arousing the enthusiasm
of the arty for centuries. Most back-
ward races love singing, dancing, story-
telling and the like. These escapes from
life were all that the Russian workers
could afford under Czarism. Evidently
the same position exists under Stalinism.
Lenin was a materialist. He aimed at
turning a nation of work-shy mystics into
busy money-makers with no time for the
picturesque ikons and fabrics prized by
collectors in London and Paris ; no time
for folk-songs or folk-dances ; no time
for God. The evidence of nearly all
those who have been to Russia recently
suggests that an essential part of his
plan has failed. The U.S.S.R. is just an-
other capitalist State with a good educa-
tional system (not nearly so advanced as
the British system, but moving that way),
a big army, and a Government that fights
for trade by means of quotas and inter-
national agreements. According to a
London “Times” writer whose articles
are being reprinted here:
In the Torgsin shops—the only ones,
broadly speaking, where the Soviet citizen
can buy anything worth buying—the cur-
rency of his country is not legal tender.
And few Russians to-day have any gold
or foreign money left.
So the workers have returned to the
cheap amusements which Lenin classed
with religion as “dope.”
Australia is only what the lady calls
“culturally backward” because it is eco-
nomically forward. In every age and
clime when individuals or classes have
ceased to be poor they have signalised
it by taking to some more or less costly
form of sport. Sad, no doubt; but a
sociological truism.
Forgan Smith’s Accounts.
There is not much room for pride in
Queensland Premier Forgan Smith’s
financial performance for the past six
months. With soaring revenue, he still
shows a deficit of £986,067 for the half-
year, but rejoices that it is £500,000 less
than for the same months of last year,
not taking loan money into account.
Revenue actually increased by £615,571
(10 p.c.), but expenditure mounted by
£165,000. The amount received from the
Commonwealth was £691,118, against
£548,118 for the first half of 1933-34.
From every important source of taxation
a little more trickled ; railways collected
£414,000 more. Some of it came from
the moving of starving stock.
Apart from its addition to expenditure
from consolidated revenue, the Govern-
ment has sliced half a million more than
in the equivalent period of 1933-34 from
the Trust Fund cake —£3,278,688, against
£2,774,000, though this is about balanced
by receipts—and almost doubled the
half-yearly loan expenditure —£2,200,453,
against £1,127,564 in the previous period.
However, what’s an increase of
£1,742,000 to a State which soon is to
have an election, and whose Premier is
an adept at squeezing money from the
Premiers’ Conference?
Back to Palestine.
From a veteran of the Gallipoli and
Palestine campaigns:
An A.I.F. Light Horseman revisiting Palestine
is liable to receive a few shocks if he thought
that overthrowing Turkish rule would put an
end to the troubles of that unhappy country.
The establishment of “a national home for
the Jews” has brewed, and is still brewing,
trouble between Jew and Arab, Jew and Briton
and Arab and Briton. The best type of Jew
does not go there.
Of 153,700 immigrants admitted from 1920
to 1933 Poland supplied 40.9 p.c., Russia 18.5
p.c., Germany 5 p.c., Roumania 4.7 p.c.,
Lithuania 3.5 p.c., Latvia 1.3 p.c., Asia 9.8 p.c.,
the U.S.A. 3 p.c. and the British Empire a
fraction of 1 p.c. The Communist type is
strongly in evidence.
Britain aims at restricting immigration to the
absorptive capacity of the country, but the
Zionist organisation, which has great influence
in British politics, presses for more and more.
The Jewisn population has increased from
56,000 in 1918 to 250,000 in 1934, the increase
in the last three years alone being 75,000.
Towns have developed out of all proportion to
the country districts. There is a speculative
building boom, and land in Tel Aviv has been
bringing 10 times what it brought two years ago.
Tel Aviv is entirely Jewish, Haifa half-Jewish,
Jerusalem more than half.
Arab and Jew mix as oil and water do. The
Arab is still 73 p.c. of the total population.
Riots occur from time to time, and there is a
heap of trouble coming which Britain will have
to meet. And for what? Travelling about one
feels how very alien this British-ruled country
is; but there are three or four British things
that one observes: Government House with the
Union Jack flying, British police and troops,
and the Great War cemetery. One can at
least feel at home in the cemetery I


Society
"AND IT'S PRINTED WIMBLES INKS"
“J. Bunkhum Daillach”: A “S. M.
Herald” correspondent (Mr. Aonaghus
Domhnullach) referred last week to “the
just indignation of the Gael” at the High
Court ruling in the Kisch case:
From the aspect of purity, English is
much less a European language than
Gaelic.
In consequence, as every cultured travel-
ler knows, Gaelic is fast ousting the
tainted dialect of the Sassenach in Scot-
land. I overheard this witty fragment
in a fashionable Edinburgh hotel a few
months ago:
“Erysuppalais naigh y hoolahain, Elofan-
tiashar Abracaidabrach.” (“I am thirsty,
Jem McNab.”)
“Dungailloch an codwullaich mulloch-
managar hoot, Poisuniveagh Cut-an-Cum-
aghain?” (“When were you otherwise,
Bobby Fraser ?”)
It illustrates two features of Gaelic which
give it an immense advantage over a bar-
barian tongue such as English, viz.: (1)
terseness, (2) melody. It is a historical
truism that nobody has been known to
fall asleep during a Gaelic sermon or
speech. As the Druids used to say:
“Faillach bai O bealliach y na homnul-
lach heigh basrabrigandhar ha.” (“As
well sleep with the ear to a circular-
saw.”)
“Borderer”: Sydney press descriptions
of the “Highland’ gathering on New
Year’s Day always give me a headache.
This year the prize asininity must be
credited to the “Telegraph”: “All day
there was the rich burr of the Gaelic of
the hills and the broad smile and the
merry jest of the Hielan’ men.” There
is no burr in Gaelic, the softest and most
euphonious of tongues, and this softness
of intonation is carried into English
when a Highlander speaks it. Highland
English is as different from the Border
Doric as usquebaugh is from Scottish
ale. Further, as a race, the Scottish
Gaels do not indulge in “broad smiles
and merry jests.” They are a reserved
and aloof folk, especially in company.

“8.0. P.”: Jilted swains don’t often sue
for breach-of-promise, and when they do
—as happens sometimes, even in Australia
—they are more likely to get derision than
damages. The reason is fairly obvious,
but I have never read of it being put so
tersely and cogently as by a Scottish
sheriff who heard one of these cases at
Falkirk. Said his Honor —or whatever
they call a Scottish sheriff—after counsel
for the plaintiff had depicted the lacerated
state of his client’s heart:
But he hasn’t lost his market. That is
the point that is almost invariably made
for a lady.
The case didn’t go much further.

“Annan Water”: I see that the fatu-
ous idea of equipping an Australian
militia battalion with kilts has been re-
vived. If the men to wear it were of
Gaelic extraction, the matter might be
passed over with a grin, but it is obvi-
ously impossible under our defence sys-
tem to ensure that they will even be of
Scottish descent. Furthermore, the kilt
has many drawbacks as a garment. In
grass-seed country the lower edge is
rapidly converted into a bandsaw which
plays havoc with the wearer’s knees and
adjacent territory. Further, it is a poor
defence against cold ; witness the freez-
ing to death of several Highlanders at
Belfast on the Transvaal high veld during
the Boer War. By all accounts a similar
lesson was driven home in Flanders.,

“Scribe”: Many years ago I was sent
out to interview one of Victoria’s most
successful financiers, a man whose estate
closely approached the million when he
died a few years later. I found the
family seat, to be a dingy weatherboard
cottage in a Melbourne industrial suburb,
the sort of place which would bring 15
shillings a week rent. The front door
was ajar, and when I knocked—there
was no bell —something was dragged
away ; then the lady of the house rose
from her bucket and, scrubbing-brush in
hand, directed me to the master, who,
she said, was having his lunch on the
back verandah. I walked down the
narrow passage and emerged through the
back door to find the capitalist seated on
the edge of the verandah, clasp knife in
“Yea, it doth appear to shut rather
suddenly.”
hand. Beside him was a dirty news-
paper ; on it lay a loaf of bread and a
smudge of butter. Waving the German
sausage which he held in his left hand,
he courteously motioned me to a seat by
his side and proceeded, with his mouth
full, to give me matter for the interview.
It was first-class copy, too.

“S.T.S.”: S. Aus., which had a definite
Foundation date, December 28, 1836,
celebrated its 98th birthday as usual at
Glenelg. It now welcomes anyone with
80 years’ residence, with special honors
for “pioneers” not later than 1840. There
were two, Mrs. Currie (who made a
speech of thanks) and William Pritchard
(whose grand-nephew is this year’s Rhodes
scholar). Many over 90 signed the roll.
“Saw a corroboree on the park lands”
and “milked a goat for the Governor’s
tea” were among the reminiscences.

“Irrident”: The Saar, or a good deal
of it, has been French in the past, as well
as Prussian; indeed, its capital, Saar-
brucken, has been French twice. Strictly
speaking, it was French before it was ever
Prussian. The Counts of Ardennes ruled
there in their own right for a few cen-
turies in the Middle Ages, and it was the
royal residence of the Princes of Nassau-
Saarbrucken for a few more. But France
grabbed it in 1797, and French it re-
mained till the Corsican tyrant went down.
at Waterloo and the map of Europe was
recast. Then it became Prussian. But
France had some reason for regarding
it as a lost province, and at the outset
of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 Saar-
brucken was seized and occupied by the
French. It was one of their few initial
successes; the Germans recaptured it
four days later. The trouble about these
irredenta problems is that each side can
mostly make out some sort of a case
about having been there first.

“Sherlock”: The picnic-party murder
at Inverloch (Vic.) on New Year’s Day
makes the fifth unsolved murder of Mel-
bourne women and girls during the last
10 years. The victims in three cases
were children, and the details showed
that the crimes were the work of de-
generates ; the others were Molly Deane,
killed on her way home to St. Kilda,
and Jean Mackenzie, 21 years old, found
dead in her room. This last was the most
mysterious affair of all. The girl led
what is ironically described as a gay life,
but lived quietly by herself. She had
little or no money, and no known
enemies.

“G. Trotter”: Says Archbishop
Downey: “In Australia there is not the
disfiguring daubing of beauty spots with
advts. which is implied by Americanisa-
tion.” As one who has travelled over
most of the roads of California I assert
that Australia, especially Sydney, dis-
figures its beauty spots by daubed advts.
in a way which America never dreams
of. The road-postering which has raised
wild howls from many Americans is
generally artistic, often humorous and
always informative. I never saw any pic-
turesque rocks bearing the tarred injunc-
tion “Rub in Jones’s Ointment,” which
is common all around Sydney’s coastal
beauty spots. The comic Yankee sign
is exemplified by successive notices at
each mile reading: “Five miles to Buck
Smith’s” ; “Four miles to Buck Smith’s” ;
“Buck Smith grows his own chickens ’;
“Buck Smith’s chickens are famous”;
“One mile to Buck Smith’s” ; “This is
Buck Smith’s, walk right in. Chicken

like.”

“H.A.L.”: When the Glenelg (S.A.)
Town Hall was built a clock was in-
stalled in the tower with quite a musical
bell to chime the hours. But residents
complained that the striking of the clock
kept them awake o’ nights, and agitated
for the silencing of the bell. Bumbles
met in solemn conclave, and decided on
a compromise. They had the dome of
the clock tower covered with sheet lead,
and ever since the Glenelg town clock
has struck the hours with a dull and
leaden “tonk.”

“Como”: An anonymous heroine
came to light in Melbourne on a recent
dark and stormy night. She was sitting
on the verandah of a boatshed with a
boy friend when a woman and her child
fell into the Yarra and were swept out
into deep water. Fully clothed, the girl
dived in and brought both safe to land.
Then, having handed over the rescued
couple to the police, she declined to
give her name or her address and strolled
off to the nearest tram. Citizens who save
life and melt away quietly without let-
ting anybody know their identity are not
so rare as might be thought. Years ago
one hero was so modest that he gave a
false name and address—those of a
suburban dignitary, who had an uncom-
fortable week or so correcting fulsome
speeches of congratulation from friends
and utter strangers. In this case, how-
ever, there was a good reason for the dis-
like of publicity ; the humorist, accord-
ing to the police, was wanted on several
charges of burglary. The late Edward
Dyson, a well-known Bulletin contribu-
tor, once saved a man in the lower Yarra
and refused to fell the policeman who he
was. Yet another case was that of Dr.
Kenny, who loomed large during the
Eucharistic Congress; once, sculling a
boat up the Yarra, he rescued two chil-
dren, one of whom unfortunately it was
impossible to resuscitate. It was a long
time before his identity leaked out.

“Kerys”: I was awakened by sounds
of an early-morning altercation in the
Binks backyard. Binks was pursuing
his heir Peter, aged 14, round the vege-
table patch, bellowing the while, “I’ll
learn you to waste the matches.” He
failed to catch the uxxhin, who retired
muttering something about the old pot’s
unreasonableness in making such a fuss
over a measly box of matches. Binks, in
obvious need of sympathy, called that
night. For years, he related, he had had
an occasional outing at Randwick,
achieved only by patient saving of the
meagre weekly allowance handed back
by Mrs. B. Binks had this time managed
a five-pound note, which he carried in
his matchbox, safely stowed below a
covering of matches. Young Peter’s
morning duty is to light the kitchen fire,
and it was his playful habit, hitherto not
frowned on by his father, to finish up
by tossing the box of matches into the
fire and enjoying the subsequent con-
flagration. That morning the fire refused
to burn, and Peter, out of matches,
sneaked in and borrowed dad’s. He
tossed the box, as usual, on the fire, cheer-
fully confessing when dad was search-
ing perturbedly for his fiver. I have now
agreed to act as guardian of Binks’s punt-
ing fund.

“Ethne”: Everyone knows —or should
know by this time—that Knox, the
League of Nations Administrator of the
Saar, is an Australian, and, by all ac-
counts, an excellent advertisement for
the land that bore him. But I am bound
to say that this addendum, from the
London representative of the “S. M.
Herald,” leaves me a trifle puzzled:
Although he left Australia at the age of
seven, and has never since returned, Mr.
Knox retains his Australian characteristics
of appearance and mannerisms to a
remarkable degree.
I have known Englishmen who came to
Australia at a more tender age than that
at which Knox left it and yet never lost
the burr or brogue that marked their
district, or even their county. But there
could hardly have been anything discern-
ible as a Sydney accent when the infant
Knox left these shores. As for “charac-
teristics of appearance,” a certain
“hatchet-faced” quality was attributed to
Australians during the war, though I
doubt if we had ever noted it ourselves.
Knox may have that, but the problem
of what “mannerisms” he could have
borne away from this country at seven #
a knotty one.
A DISTINCTION.
“The Mayor of Mosman contended that, as women’s
bare thighs and exposed backs were not regarded

logical objection to men revealing their chests and
legs in shorts. He was overruled by his colleagues,
who revoked the permission given by his Worship
for shorts to be worn.”
There’s a homely old adage in general use,
And frequently quoted, that sauce for the goose
Is equally sauce for the gander;
But you mustn’t rely on it, please understand,
Where the queens of the surf and the sheiks of
the sand
Alternately splash and philander.
Assent it may win from the buck and his gin
Or the mer-folk with homes in the coral,
But it’s patently clear as a tankard of beer
That it doesn’t apply at Balmoral.
Not much!
It doesn’t go down at Balmoral.
The scantly-clad maiden, with no one to chide,
May dabble her toes in the wash of the tide
Or chug through the surf like a steamer;
Anon on the sands she may coyly recline,
Displaying a generous section of spine
And a double allowance of femur.
But the beau with the chest insufficiently dressed
Will be only ensuring a quarrel
With the whims and the fads of municipal dads
Whose ruling is law at Balmoral —
The crowd
That’s down upon shorts at Balmoral.
It seems you may emulate Gunga el Din
When you go for a dip; and it won’t be a sin
In the eyes of the prudes and the wowsers
If blouses and skirts are your usual wear—
But you’ll find to your cost it’s another affair
If you’re broken to shirts and to trousers.
So one needs must deduce that gander and
goose
Are as diff’rent as sorrel and laurel
To the Bumbles who meet in their Mosman
retreat
To lay down the law for Balmoral,
And say
What’s proper or not at Balmoral.

“Findy”: Time, 1 a.m. on Christmas
Day. Mrs. Banker, hearing a noise
on the front verandah and refusing to
attribute it to Father Christmas, awakens
her husband and sends him out to in-
vestigate. A shadowy form on the front
lawn, being challenged, pleads that it is
“only having a rest.” The intruder is
moved on. Comes the dawn, and Mrs.
Banker discovers, on going out for the
milk-jug, one pair ladies’ slippers (size 3),
one tea-towel (soiled), one bag of cherries
(much sat upon), one pumpkin (large).
The inference is that one Christmas Eve
reveller arrived home present-less. Still,
he can have the first two items if he calls
at the right address. The slippers didn’t
fit, anyhow.

“Cinchona”: Discussing the outbreak
in Ceylon, “Quartan” recalls that malaria
still “crops up occasionally in England”
(B. 9/1 /’35). Very rarely, I think, now-
adays, though 50 years ago it was still
recorded as endemic in certain parishes
on the Essex side of the Thames estuary.
Other once-malarious localities, freed
from the scourge by drainage, were the
fen districts of the eastern counties and
the marshy lands of Somerset, where
Alfred burned the cakes. A queer
thing about malaria is that, while its
worst breeding-grounds are around the
deltas and estuaries of great rivers
and amongst rank vegetation, it has
had its strongholds in barren rocks in
the lonian Islands, high tablelands in
Asia and even in the Andes and the
Rocky Mountains. The most devastating
epidemic in modern times, was that of
1872, which swept Europe, North
America and Southern India almost
simultaneously. The disease must have

a great fight for the right to take her
back to Australia. He pleaded that she had
made life easier not only for himself but
for other Australians who were allotted on
field work to the farm to which she be-
longed. The authorities told him that,
whilst provision was made for Diggers’
wives, married abroad, to accompany
them back, it did not apply to a woman
of an enemy country. The Digger had his
name removed from boat-roll after boat-
roll whilst he continued his petitions,
always unsuccessfully; and finally he
took his discharge to enlist in the Expedi-
tionary force to Russia in order to delay
his return. That was the last I heard
of him. I have often wondered whether
he lived through the Russian campaign
and was reunited to his Gretchen.

“Comic Strip”: While Australian law
and convention frown on all attempts to
organise nudism after the manner of
other countries, the unofficial nudists are
adding to their number with every hot
day and night. At all Port Phillip’s pub-
lic beaches bathers attire themselves with
an eye to the prejudices of councils and
beach inspectors, but
the private beaches
tell a different story.
In many of these
strands, approachable
only through private
property, the near-
nudes prevail during
daylight, and three-
quarters of the
bathers would, in a
public place, be swept
into the inspector’s
drag-net. When the
shades of night fall even the trifles are
discarded, and Eden returns. Neverthe-
less, the conduct at all such places as
have come under my notice is as decor-
ous as a cathedral service.

“Cosmos” loses another illusion:
I used to believe that all killers resembled
the degenerates I have seen in Australian,
English and French docks. Small, rickety,
unwashed beings with queer little tousled heads
and the silly, darting eyes that one notices in
cowed dogs. Came the talkies, and I got an
impression that, in the U.S.A. anyhow, master-
minds and -men were taking to murder. With-
out exception, the leading assassins of Holly-
wood films proved to be handsome, exquisitely-
tailored young men, as brave as they were
ruthless, who stared their ridiculous opponents
out of countenance before exterminating them,
and, if overcome, died game. As a rule, though,
they didn t die, but emerged from the pem-
tendary a ft er a short stretch—dressy and arro-
gant as ever—to marry nice girls. Came the
Gazettes and the practice of filming Jack
(“Pretty Boy”) Schintzel, “Handsome Bob’
Bumm^ Mickie ( “ A ngel-face”) Rafferty
and Other press celebrities in the hands of the
police. Without exception the police turned
out to be large, confident, efficient-looking cus-
tomers> and> | lso without exception, the under-
worjd heroes were small, rickety, un-
washed beings with queer little tousled heads
and the silly, darting eyes that one notices
in cowed dogs. So I have reverted to my old
be]ief tbat ad k ifi ers resemble the scrubby
degenerates I have seen in Australian, English
and French docks.
“I. Temple”: A daily-paper contri-
butor quoted last week from an alleged
speech by Sir Henry Hawkins to a con-
victed. thief; it was a riot of mixed
metaphors, and ended:
Therefore you must be transported for
the term of seven years.
Some objections are that transportation
ended in 1864, while Hawkins didn’t be-
come a Judge till 1876, and that the
clear-headed little man never mixed a
metaphor in his life. His rare addresses
to prisoners (several of which I heard as
a youth) were carefully prepared public
warnings—miracles of condensation de-
signed chiefly to discourage garrotters and
“Look out, boys! Here comes our soup.”
blackmailers. Next day another daily
reprinted “a story of King Edward —the
famous story of Lily Langtry and the
ice.” In the original Mrs. Brown Potter
became persona non grata at Marl-
borough House for putting a piece
of ice down the then Prince of
Wales’s back; and it was almost
certainly a lie. Some names attract
legends as garbage attracts flies; Mae
West is the latest example—and, like
old soldiers, the yarns never die.
The one about Hawkins was probably
told first about a Georgian Judge, and
nothing is surer than that our grand-
children will learn that Greta Garbo,
Marlene Dietrich, Norma Shearer and
other contemporary charmers put ice
down the present Prince’s back. In
scandal-mongering nothing succeeds like
unoriginality.

“H.S.” on salesmanship:
I was startled the other evening to find in
my parked car a document that resembled a
summons. It turned out to be an advt. The
effect was to make me determined that, wher-
ever I spent in future, it would not be with the
firm which has thought out this method of
galvanising my attention. The intellect behind
the Sydney Bridge pylon show obviously be-
longs to a psychologist of sorts. After charg-
ing patrons Is. entrance-money he charges them
3d. each for the privilege of writing their
names in the pylon visitors’ book. Wider and
more enduring publicity can be got by scratch-
ing one’s name on a wall or rock in the usual
way ; yet on the day I went to renew ac-
quaintance with a friend of my childhood —
the camera obscura —there was a queue waiting
to get at the book. I had climbed many weary
stairs past distorting mirrors, peepshows and
adjurations to telephone a friend or write to
my mother from the pylon, only to find to my
fury that it would cost another 6d. to see the
camera obscura. I didn’t see it, but here again
the pylon psphychologist was right ; people
were crowding in. Movie ballyhoo is an out-
standing insult to the human brain. A lot
the purveyors care! Their motto, like that of
most politicians, is “Treat the human brain
rough, and you can’t go wrong.”

“G.M.”: Melbourne seems to possess
a more highly-developed sense of idiotic
humor than Sydney. During 1934 its
firemen were called out by practical
jokers no fewer than 1579 times, while in
Sydney the tally was barely half that
number. The imbecile who calls out
the fire brigade for a joke reminds me
of the coster who related chucklingly the
story of a big fire in the East End of
London. “ ‘Jump,’ we says ; ‘we got a
blanket,’ ” he related, after telling how the
victim was running along the parapet
looking for a means of escape. “So ’e
jumped, an’ we never ’ad no blanket an’
’e broke ’is bloomin’ neck. I nearly died
larfin’.” What seems to be urgently
needed is a fire-alarm which will hold
the alarmist until the brigade arrives.
The bona fide caller would hardly kick
against the detention.

“S.A.C.”: As one who served in the
Boer War I am interested to hear
that a Boer Bible is now available in
Afrikaans, the curious semi-artificial
tongue built up on the old jargon
of the Taal and now one of the official
languages of South Africa. When I knew
the country Afrikaans had just been
launched, its chief sponsor being Secre-
tary Reitz, of the Transvaal, an ex-Chief
Justice of the Free State and a Cam-
bridge man. The spoken language was
the Taal, a weird genderless lingo made
up of scraps of many tongues, all thrown
together like the ingredients of a fo’c’sle
salmagundi. The Bible in every Boer
home on the veld was in Hollands Dutch
and largely incomprehensible even to the
few who were able to read it at all. As
a mounted policeman I came in pretty
close contact with these people, Doppers
mostly, and was struck by their general
knowledge of the Old Testament. I sup-
pose they picked it all up from the predi-
kants during pastoral visits and the quar-
terly natchmaal, and, as with most illiter-
ates, their retentive memory did the rest.
* * * *
“Fodgie”: Scarcely anyone appears to
have noticed John Monash’s own tribute
to Brudenell White. It appeared in
his letters, as published in the Adelaide
“Advertiser,” only a few days before God-
ley’s speech, and was couched in identi-
cal terms: “by far the ablest soldier Aus-
tralia has produced.” The repetition of
the phrase may have been unconscious
plagiarism on Godley’s part (B.
12/12/’34). In the welter of comment
about the egotism of Monash I think it
unfair that his generous tribute should
be overlooked. Another consideration
to be borne in mind is that every man
gives full expression to his ego in speak-
ing to his wife.
Jjc •!>
“G.M.”: “Oxmead” (B. 26/12/’34)
says that a coiner must employ an in-
ferior metal, or a metal that can be dis-
tinguished from the genuine article, to
make a profit. I submit that he can make
a profit on the same metal. It is a genera-
tion and more since spurious half-
crowns were imported into Australia
from China spurious in that they
were not turned out by the Imperial
mint. They were 100 per cent, silver for
all that, and returned a big profit to the
manufacturer, seeing that at that time
there was only 7d. worth of silver in Is.
“Sinbad”: In 1919 seven lakhs of
counterfeit rupees (700,000) were cir-
culated in India. They were of the
same alloy and value as the legiti-
mate coins ; the only difference in the
design was a microscopic dot imme-
diately above the crown on the King’s
head. This dot was not noticed until
the coiner, having distributed the lot at
an estimated profit of 350,000 rupees,
courteously wrote to the Government
and mentioned it. As they were perfect
coins, it was decided to leave them in
circulation, and when I left India in
1925 they were still showing up fairly
frequently.

“The ’Loo” on a new calling:
With the rise of golf, ball-pinching on links
open to the public has developed into an organ-
ised industry. A Sydney captain of larceny who
got three months at Redfern last week for his
operations at Moore Park employed a staff of
boys, had “ball-caches all over the links,” and
used powerful binoculars to mark the drives
down. On the day he was arrested “over 30
players had complained of his stealing their
balls,” which may mean that he got away with
three or four times as many. An adept can
make a day’s wages on any fine Sunday at
Moore Park, which, owing to its configuration,
is the ball-pirates’ Spanish Main, so to speak.
Park-touting no longer attracts. Merciless
assaults have been committed on members of
the Sydney underworld by disturbed lovers
(the girls are sometimes as violent in their re-
prisals as their admirers), and where victims
agreed to pay it often turned out that they hadn’t
much more than their tram-fares between them.
Golfers are too genteel to brawl as a rule,
though one or two ball-snatchers bear mashie-
niblick marks which they will carry with them to
their graves. Balls which have been found be-
fore they were lost, as it were, bring Is. each,
and the buyers are often the losers in both
senses of the word.
BALLADE OF THE BULL OF BASHIN.
Your bushman is a gentle bloke,
And of a fraternising bent,
qis wrath not easy to provoke
By chance expression or event;
But there’s a saying that has sent
Him ofttimes raging furiously
’Cause of the sneer that with it went:
“And then the bull ran up a tree.”
Tis mostly used by coves who poke
Their noses in with fell intent
To guy the one who lately spoke
A truthful piece, or would invent
A yarn of fact and fancy blent
To ease the drab monotony,
Uncalling for the sentiment
“And then the bull ran up a tree.”
I’ve known it frequently invoke
A fervent fistic argument,
And germinating friendship choke,
And sour the wine of camp content.
The mildest chap might well resent
The questionable jeu d’esprit
Clothed in those words, unkindly meant:
“And then the bull ran up a tree.”
Cobbers across the continent,
Forbear to say provokingly
When a raconteur’s gas is spent,
“And then the bull ran up a tree.”

POLITICAL POINTS
No heads were broken nor was any-
one’s house blown up when the Saar-
landers voted on Sunday, and the Aus-
tralian-born head of the League Com-
mission must have been the happiest
man in Europe that night. A timely
fall of snow assisted. In all ages snow
and rain have been great aids to authority
when the mob shuffled its million feet.
It would be safe to lay long odds
against acceptance of the Stewart plan
for spending £21,000,000 (and the rest)
on unifying the gauges. Argyle and
Butler have come out against it and
against the alternative scheme suggested
by veteran-journalist Smethurst, of
Broken Hill —a 4ft. line from
Broken Hill to Port Augusta and another
from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle. Collier
would accept the latter proposal if the
Commonwealth found the money. His
State undertook to build the thing at its
own cost, but dropped the subject long
ago, and secessionists never mention it.
Dr. Page is reported to have said in
Brisbane that the British Government
would “not now impose its restrictions on
Australian meat.” Mr. Lyons announced
delightedly that to March 31 meat quotas
would be limited to 643,700 cwt
450,000 cwt. mutton, 187,000 cwt. beef and
veal, the rest pork ; “3000 cwt. in excess
of Britain’s proposed regulations.” If
this isn’t restriction as originally pro-
posed, only experts like Page, with plat-
forms to uphold, can tell the difference.
C. L. A. Abbott, M.P. for Gwydir,
reckons that Australian woolgrowers owe
£139,000,000, or about 255. per sheep.
The Commonwealth and States owe
£1,222,558,000, or £lB3 per inhabitant;
the States alone have increased their
debts from £397,500,000 in 1919 to
£829,500,000. But the Treasurers don't
worry as Abbott doesJ
Chickens of the depression are coming
home to roost. When the first signs oi
slump appeared, people refrained from
sending their boys to universities ; one
result is a shortage of young medical men
for hospital posts. The trouble with eco-
nomic trouble is that it doesn’t fight on
one front. It gets humanity going and
coming.
Under the new Queensland Transport
Strangulation Act, a man running a
goods service between Toowoomba and
Brisbane will have to pay £2lBO p.a. in
fees (his vehicles are valued at £1950),
and the owners of two passenger ser-
vices £3605 and £2495 respectively. They
have been saving the public time and
money, but are to be sacrificed to the
railwaymen’s union vote.
The Bulletin has suggested that the
States should surrender education and
taxation of incomes to the Common-
wealth, receiving as part compensation
the exclusive right to levy land tax —
except, of course, in Federal territories.
National control of education was dis-
cussed at a Brisbane conference of the
Federated State-school Teachers, the sub-
ject being raised by a Victorian dele-
gate, Miss Gilbert, in a capital speech.
The voting was equal: Victoria and Tas-
mania for, N. S. Wales and Queensland
against. The chairman, a Queenslander,
gave his casting vote against the resolu-
tion from Victoria.
In South Australia it is not considered
that public servants are too old at 60.
Sixty-five is the official retiring age, but
under an Act passed in 1933 it may, till
the end of 1938, be extended at the Gov-
ernment’s discretion; and extensions
were granted last year to a number of
high officials, among them the Architect-
in-Chief, the Government Printer, the
Conservator of Forests, the Chief Store-
keeper and the secretary to the Public
Service Commissioner. All the gentlemen
will retire in a few weeks. The State will
save nothing ; their places will have to
be filled, and they are all entitled to
pensions.
Another year of Roosevelt has left the
U.S.A. with a deficit of $3,500,000,000
and a public debt of $28,500,000,000, and
the President blithely predicts that by
June 30, 1936, the debt will reach
$34,239,000,000 (£6,847,800,000). He goes
up for re-election that year. Meantime
he obviously retains his hold on a people
familiar with Tammany benefactions in
particular localities, but unused to Gov-
ernment gifts on the grand scale.
“Last week brought strikes of rubber-workers in N. S. Wales and
of goldminers and lumpers in West alia. Six thousand miners are out,
and gold production has ceased.”
“As soon as you get a glimpse of him, sock him.”
Canberra had to agree to the temporary
limitation of meat exports, but, so far
from helping it to make a virtue of neces-
sity, Queensland Labor Ministers are rail-
ing at it. Bulcock, the Minister of Agri-
culture, growls that “the principle of re-
striction has been established,” Bulcock
and his friends adopt the “principle”
themselves when it suits them. They shut
wheat from other States out of the
Queensland market. They restrict jobs in
the public service to members of public-
service unions, and jobs outside the ser-
vice to members of other unions. They
even restrict relief work to members of
the A.W.U.
Melbourne “Argus,” giving the Tariff
Board as its authority, states that the
Australian iron and steel industry, “hav-
ing been developed at great cost,” is
“now able to sell most of its products at
prices below the cost of imports landed
duty-free.” On its own account, it says:
Increasing efficiency has assisted Aus-
tralian industries to reach the position of
requiring but light tariff protection.
And doesn’t the old lady wish they may
get it! Still, the admission of “increasing
efficiency” is notable considering its
source. The old story was that tariffs
promoted inefficiency.
Amiable as he is personally, Clydes-
dale, M.L.C., will be the death of the
Westralian Labor Government yet.
Baulked of a five years’ billet as chair-
man of it's Lotteries Commission at £1000
p.a., he has withdrawn his notice of in-
tention to resign as M.L.C., and will
retire from the commission instead. The
Government having shown itself so
anxious to oblige him in every respect, it
is believed in Perth that some way will
be found of letting him continue to hold
two jobs. Clydesdale is, or was, John
Wren’s chief representative in Westralia,
but that scarcely explains Labor’s extra-
ordinary regard for him.
While objecting to imports of so much
Dominion cowflesh, Britain has arranged
to take more fat cattle from the Free State
in exchange for coal. The deal was ill-
timed, though Australia would rather see
Saxon and Gael on good terms than
profit by their sordid trade war. It was
at first hailed with delight in De Valera’s
country, but there is no mention of the
removal of duties imposed when payment
of the land annuities was suspended, and
critics are arising. Cronin, the new Blue
Shirt leader, protests
that the Oppressor
will benefit to the
extent of “half a
million in extra cattle
duties and a million
for coal,” while the
“starving Free State
will get nothing but
the opportunity to
sell 150,000 more
cattle at a ruinous
price.”
Potatoes were 2d.
a pound in Sydney
last week. The posi-
tion could be re-
lieved by imports
from Maoriland,
and if these imports
were sanctioned
Australia would re-
cover a profitable
overseas market for
orange-growers, who
are so desperately
hard up that they
are getting doles
from the Common-
wealth and N.S.W.
But the Prime Min-
ister got a frigid re-
ception when he put
the case to a meet-
ing at Latrobe (Tas.l.
To soothe Mel-
bourne “Age,” the
P.M. gave a half-
hearted election promise that he would
have “the banking and monetary system”
investigated, and the “Age” is reminding
him of it, in a riot of polysyllables: —
In Federal circles support for the pro-
posal was reiterated and agreement ex-
pressed with the view of the “Age” tnat,
while the Australian community was in no
mood for precipitate action or for revolu-
tionary experiment, there was a definite
feeling in need of an independent and
authoritative pronouncement on a subject
of technical intricacy and wide ramification.
That’s all it will come to —words, words,
words. The “Age” should be asked to
pay the cost of its blessed “investiga-
tion.”
Federal Arbitration Judge Drake-
Brockman has made “interim awards”
restoring 1930 wages and conditions on
the N.S.W. Government railways and
tramways. Victoria was a party to the
railway case, but, strange as it may seem,
it objects to having its railways, a purely
State enterprise, managed as to wages
and working hours by Mr. Drake-
Brockman, who comes from Perth. Its
Harold Clapp and co. are exhausting
what they consider to be their legal
rights to prevent it.
According to the “Labor Daily,” Fed-
eral Arbitration Judge Drake-Brockman,
in referring to the circumstances which
have prevented his bestowing a railway
award on Victoria, was “almost vicious
in his condemnation of those re-
sponsible for the hold-up.” This is
a misrepresentation ; Mr. Drake-Brock-
man could not be vicious if he
tried. He did say that “a grave in-
dustrial disturbance” had “arisen out of
the action of the Victorian Commission-
ers.” According to the same newspaper,
a still graver industrial disturbance will
rage in the N.T. when the Drake-Brock-
man award for that region “becomes
operative.”
Lang is going about saying that
Stevens has “remitted huge taxes to his
friends the bookmakers,” and he is say-
ing it so often that he will end by be-
lieving it himself. The truth is that Lang
slugged racing with a 10 p.c. tax on suc-
cessful wagers, stake included, which
nearly settled the sport—it hasn’t recov-
ered yet. The punter paid it. For this
idiotic impost Stevens substituted a 1
p.c. tax on turnover. This the book-
maker pays.
Commonwealth statistics for the fourth
quarter of 1934 show unemployment at
18.8 p.c. of unionists. This is double
the 1929 percentage, but 11.2 p.c, better
than the rate at May, 1932. Queensland
(9.1 p.c.) is the only State which shows
a rate as low as the Commonwealth aver-
age for 1929, but the 90.9 per cent of
“employed” includes persons on tem-
porary relief work.
Accounts of the condition of Russia
under Soviet rule are often conflicting
and vague, but this item from London
“Times” is definite enough;
Death sentences to the number of 117
have already been carried out to avenge
the murder of Kirov. Judge Ulrich con-
demned 71 and Judge Matulevitch the re-
mainder. The trials are held in secret, and
prisoners are not permitted counsel for the
defence.
It recalls Jeffreys and the Bloody Assizes.
Still, Jeffreys’s victims were allowed coun-
sel, and even in 1685 English prisoners
on charges of treason were tried in open
court.
An elderly Victorian went to bed the
other night a K.B. and woke up a K.B.E.
As K.B. he had the right to wear, “on
the left side of the coat,” a vermilion
badge:—
Upon an oval medallion of vermilion,
enclosed by a scroll, a cross-hilted sword,
belted and sheathed, pommel upwards,
the whole set about with the sword-belt,
all gilt.
As K.B.E. he may wear, also “on the
left side of the coat,” an eight-pointed
silver star, together with “a purple
ribbon, l|in. broad, and pendant there-
from the badge”;—
A silver-gilt cross, enamelled pearl-
grey, in the centre of which, in a circle
enamelled crimson, is a representation of
Britannia, seated.
Whether the silver star and the purple
ribbon and the pearl-grey-and-crimson
and vermilion badges may be sported at
the same time only the Lord Chamber-
lain may decide. But it doesn’t matter.
To most Australians K.Bs. (the titles, not
the gentlemen) are two a penny and
K.B.Es. three for tuppence.
From Canberra;
Lyons has entered upon his fourth year as
Prime Minister. He is unlikely to outlast
Bruce, who was in office from February 9,
1923, to October 22, 1929, or Hughes, whose
four Ministries obeyed him from October 27,
1915, to February 9, 1923; but he may stay
in longer than any of the others. Watson had
the briefest term (April 27 to August 17, 1904).
Then came Reid (August 18, 1904, to July 5,
1905), Cook (June 24, 1913, to September 17,
1914), Scullin (October 22, 1929, to January 6,
1932), Barton (January 1, 1901, to September
24, 1903), Deakin (September 24, 1903, to April
27, 1904; July 5, 1905, to November 13, 1908,
and June 2, 1909, to April 29, 1910) and Fisher
(November 13, 1908, to June 1, 1909; April
29, 1910, to June 24, 1913, and September 17,
1914, to October 27, 1915). The records sug-
gest that a politician who begins as Labor and
turns has a better chance of becoming Prime
Minister than one who sticks to his party, in
spite of all temptations to change to other
creations —and of lasting longer as such.

PERSONAL
ITEMS
Alec Poynton is dead in Adelaide at
81. A native of Castlemaine (Vic.), but
anything but a Wild Colonial Boy, he
was in politics for just on 30 years as
M.L.A. for Flinders (S.A.) and M.H.R.
for S.A. (1901-03) and Grey (to 1922),
and he achieved office in both State and
Commonwealth. He was Labor till the
party split on the conscription issue, and
the A.L.P. was sorry to part company
with him, for he was straight as a gun-
barrel. A son was killed in the Great
War.
“S.A.”; Poynton’s taste in clothes was
a pain in the neck to Billy Hughes—
always, as the movies say, a snappy
dresser. As Billy’s P.M.G. Alec often
appeared at State functions in a bowler
hat and morning coat, rounded off with
a collar and tie that anybody else in the
wearer’s position would long since have
garbaged.
Passed out at Mossman (Q.), Boate
Santo, the last island “boy” left in Aus-
tralia from the Kanaka days. Boate had
lived in a hut beside the Daintree River
for 60 of his 80 years.
Herbert Phillipps, dead in Adelaide at
87, “made the best of both worlds.” He
was for many years head of G. and R.
Wills, chairman of Adelaide Executor
and Trustee Co. and Belgian Consul. To
the end he was chairman —33 years of
it—of the State’s savings bank. Also he
was prominent in Y.M.C.A., Congrega-
tional Union, Children’s Hospital, Mater-
nity Home and a host of benevolent
affairs. Rosy-cheeked and active to the
last, he was in the city three days before
he died.
Herbert Gepp, who began investigat-
ing the N. S. Wales bread mystery on
Monday, was a junior chemist with the
Nobel Explosive Co. 40 years ago.
Mining and metallurgy were his special-
ties till 1926, when he became chairman
of the Migration Commission, whose
activities were -ended by the slump.
Farming is a hobby, and he was chair-
man of the Federal Commission which
has just inquired into the wheat, flour
and bread industries. He got a K.B. in
1933.
W. F. Gale, F.R.A.S., of Sydney, to
whom the Royal Astronomical Society
has awarded the Jackson Gwilt bronze
medal, first started studying the skies
under the guidance of his headmaster,
Rev. Charles R. Ord, of Paddington
House School. Gale has a private ob-
servatory at his home at Waverley, the
equipment of which includes a 12-inch
telescope. His most important discovery
was made in 1927, when he located the
furthermost member of the family of
comets associated with Jupiter.
Died in Melbourne last week at 61,
“Teddy” Flack, the first Australian to
win an Olympic event. Six feet high and
weighing a little over nine stone, it
was hard to believe he had the
stamina for a gruelling race, but in fact
he was all stamina. He won a ten-mile
championship race which finished at
Caulfield racecourse, and immediately he
had passed the tape turned round and ran
half a mile up the track again to encour-
age his team-mates to victory. His Olym-
pic wins, which he scored at the first re-
vival of the games at Athens in 1896,
were the world’s championships over
1500 metres and 800 metres.
“Old Steve”: Joe Shakespeare, who
died in Cessnock Hospital of injuries
caused by a fall of earth, was a miner
who served three terms as Mayor of
Cessnock. He also did useful work as
president of the local Hospital Board
and Progress Assoc. “Old Joe,” as he
was affectionately known (though only
51 when he died), was about the best-
loved and most-respected character in
the district. Labor was his ticket, but
that didn’t affect the regard his oppo-
nents held for him as a man. A useful
boxer in the middleweight class, he was
one of Les Darcy’s first opponents, and
he also fought Billy McNabb, Bobby
Whitelaw and other topnotchers. He
served in France with the 20th Battalion.
From Macquarie-street, Sydney;
In a list of McGowen’s Ministers (B.
9/1/’35), J. H. Cann was posted as missing.
Though in the mid-seventies, he can still play a
strenuous game of bowls.
And someone must have mixed up the late
John Perry, ex-M.L.A., with another gentleman
of the same name. The legislator never reflected
on the convivial tendencies of his fellow-
members ; in fact, he never spoke in the
Assembly on any matters other than those
affecting the_ man on the land. (I have been
through the index of his Parliamentary speeches
to make sure.) The last time I saw John
Perry he was nearing 80, and had just learned
to drive a car to enable him to assist the
Country-party candidate for Liverpool Plains.
It is doubtful if A. M. Blain, M.H.R.,
could be kept in a tub like the one in
Frith’s drawing even for a minute. He
is a lean, active Digger, all muscle and
fire, who always looks as if he had left
his camel outside after a long ride from
An M.P. who won’t be happy till he gets it.
Tanami. He comes of an old-established
droving family which used to have its
habitat on the Queensland border, and
will find even the open and windy plains
of Canberra enclosing and noisy after
years of surveying in the wide silences of
Centralia.
Adelaide Steam’s commodore Bob
Sunter, captain of the m.v. Manunda
when he passed out at 57, had
been in charge of big ships for
nearly 30 years. He was so clever
as a conjuror and card manipula-
tor that Philip Wirth offered him a per-
manent £2O a week over 30 years ago.
When in charge of H.M.A.S. Wandilla
Captain Sunter was chosen to plant a tree
in Melbourne in memory of those who
died in the war. He was the first skipper
to broadcast from an Australian ship.
On his Queensland runs he would spend
hours a day describing the passing coastal
scenery for the benefit of listeners.
Rev. Charles Frederick I’Oste cele-
brated his 106th birthday at Launceston
(Tas.) on Wednesday, but survived it
only four days. He came of a French
Huguenot family which has given five
generations of clergymen to the Anglican
Church. He was born in Lincolnshire,
arrived in Melbourne 74 years ago, and
was ordained five years later in Riverina.
He seemed to have got the better of a
severe attack of pneumonia just before
his birthday.
About some touring pressmen:
Del McCay, editor-in-chief of Associated
Newspapers, who left Sydney last week for
the fifth Press Conference, is a brother of
Adam (writer of some of the best light verse
and press yarns that The Bulletin has printed)
and of the Vic. Minister of Trade and
Customs who commanded the sth A.I.F. Divi-
sion in Egypt and France, and was subsequently
G.O.C. the A.I.F. in England. Their father
was an Ulster parson who arrived in Castle-
maine with his wife and son (the future general)
over 60 years ago. Both Del and Adam
began as journalists on Melb. “Argus,” and
both have edited Sydney “Sun” —Adam from
1917-19 (with Del as his associate), Del from
1919 onwards, with a break in London as
manager-editor of the “Sun-Herald” cable ser-
vice. The brothers are curiously alike—
stoutish, carelessly-dressed customers, with
Harry Lauder profiles, pince-nezs and a gift
for making first-class speeches on almost any
subject at a moment’s notice.
Hugh Adam, of Melb. “Herald,” is accom-
panied by a wife who possesses almost as many
university distinctions as he does. He went
to the “Herald” from the “Argus” as leader-
writer 12 years ago, and is now Editor
Deamer’s associate. He is lean, dark and verra
Scotch, though he happens to have been born
in China. He got his degrees and learned his
golf in Aberdeen.
Lloyd Dumas, managing editor of Adelaide
“ ’Tiser,” is also an “Argus” product. His
father owned and edited the Mt. Barker
“Courier.” Burly, genial and boiling with
energy, Dumas doesn’t look anything like his
45 years. He edited the “Sun-Pictorial” in Mel-
bourne and the “Sun-Herald’s” cable service
in London before settling in Adelaide.
“Handley Cross”: Every magazine
reader knew and admired the animal
stories of Cecil Aldin, who died in Lon-
don last week, aged 65. He was a cheery
little sportsman who drew and painted
dogs and horses because he knew and
loved them. His sporting color prints
were to be found in thousands of coun-
try homes and pubs up and down Eng-
land a couple of decades ago ; but artists
esteemed him most for his illustrations
of “Pickwick” and of Kipling’s “Jungle
Stories.” He was born at Slough, and
spent the whole of his adult life, sur-
rounded by horses and dogs, in the
neighborhood of London, which he
loved. He claimed to be the only work-
ing artist who had been an M.F.H. —he
had the South Berkshire for several
years.
“G. Room”: Basil Dean is to produce
“Australia a Nation.” He began his stage
career as a West End beauty-actor 25
years ago, and at 47 the girls still rave
about his teeth, marcel-wave and figure
During the war he was the army’s chief
entertainments organiser, in which capa-
city he sent companies to all the fronts
A star producer in the “legitimate’’
sphere, he turned to the cinema when
the talkies started to boom, and directed
“Escape” and “The Constant Nymph.”
His qualifications to produce an Austra-
lian national picture are not apparent.
He has never been further from London
than New York, and how he has been
induced to leave it for a strange land at
his time of life is a puzzle.
“Pre-war” remembers:
Tom Johnson, who has died in London, is
associated in my mind with a period in the his-
tory of N. S. Wales which seems as odd in
retrospect as the Rum Corps era. In those days,
if you didn’t want to be considered an enemy
of the Empire, you snarled that advocates of
the R.A.N., compulsory service and protective
tariffs were scoundrels; that the workers were
disloyal; that McGowen and his Ministers
(Holman, Carmichael, etc.) were traitors; that
Andrew Fisher, Pearce and W. M. Hughes were
enemies of marriage tie, Throne and Flag. All
this rubbish Tom Johnson believed with the
full force of his efficient but narrow- mind,
a result being that his term as Chief Com-
missioner for Railways and Tramways under
the first State Labor regime N. S. Wales had
known was practically one long row. In point
of fact, Johnson would have jarred on any
democratic community; he had been trained
in a G.N.R. office in the domineering traditions
of England’s mid-Victorian railway bosses.
Music used to soothe his savage soul; under
its influence his face seemed to become milder,
his moustache less truculent and spiky. On his
return to England he got a number of British-
Australian directorships. I ran across him in
London Union Club shortly before it left its old
site off Trafalgar-square, and discovered that
he still cherished the illusions about the com-
munistic tendencies of our workers which he
held circa 1910.
J. N. Dickenson Day, who died at
Lindfield (Sydney) last week, was a son
of E. Denny Day, the Maitland P.M.
who captured the Jewboy gang of bush-
rangers, and a grandson of James Ray-
mond, Australia’s first P.M.G. He re-
tired from the Commercial Bank about
12 years ago, being then over 70. Two
sons were killed at the war.
“Inaha” (M.L.): Archbishop O’Shea,
S.M., D.D., who became Archbishop of
Wellington and Metropolitan of Maori-
land on the death of Archbishop Red-
wood, was born in San Francisco 65
years ago. His parents brought him to
MX. as an infant, and he was the first
student enrolled at St. Patrick’s College,
which was founded by Archbishop Red-
wood in 1885. He was also the first
student of the college to be ordained to
the priesthood. St. Pat.’s boys still tell
stories of his prowess as a Rugby half-
back. A bishop appointed to assist an-
other territorial bishop is by Catholic
custom given the title of a non-existent
see, so Archbishop O’Shea, while co-
adjutor, was Archbishop of Gortyna, a
city of ancient Crete.
“Pax”: Dr. Gilroy, the new R.C.
bishop of Port Augusta (S.A.), was born
at Glebe, and spent the first five years
of his adult life in Sydney G.P.O. On
the outbreak of war he became a wire-
less operator on a transport. He studied
for the priesthood at the college which
looks across one of Springwood’s well-
watered valleys at Norman Lindsay’s
Roman villa, and was ordained in Rome
10 years ago. He took his D.D. in
Rome.
“Baffled” delivers his kick:
What principle, if any, is followed in dealing
out honors? In the last batch science (Dr.
Rivett, of the C.S. and 1.R.), banking (E. C.
Riddle, governor of the Commonwealth Bank)
and mining (Colin Fraser) were recognised.
Why not law? N. S. Wales racing got a knight-
hood. Why nothing for cricket, which has a
bigger public? Or for surfing, which attracts
10 times as many as either of them? M. L.
Shepherd, of the Defence Department, was
given a C.M.G. to add to his 1.5.0. And there
are soldiers and sailors with distinguished
records in peace and war upon whom no fount
of honor has ever cast a vestige of spray! Why
are knighthoods conferred on dud politicians
and their press heelers, and withheld from those
who have made history—Deakin, J. C. Watson,
Hughes, Bruce?

A half-interest in Australian Portland
Cement Pty. is the backbone of the busi-
ness. This Victorian co. and Kandos
(N.S.W.) pooled their resources in 1930
and formed the operating pup, capitalised
at £2,000,000. The works are at Fyans-
ford (Vic.) and Kandos (N.S.W.).
Each co. is managing agent for the
Proprietary in its own State. How the
working co. is jogging along has not been
disclosed since the merger ; its figures are
not broadcast. But conditions are defi-
nitely improving ; divs. (including p.c.
from the Stream-Line Filter Co, and
something from the Bates concern), com-
missions, etc., were £5974 higher, and the
net result (£43,411) £5300 better than in
1933. The div. was raised from 5 to 5y
p.c., and £1590 carried to reserves
(£293,146). The lay-by includes the re-
maining £144,624 of a capital profit of
£311,057 shown as a result of the merger
with Kandos. For the three years to
1932 divs. were much in excess of cur-
rent income—hence the reductions.
In Victoria there has been a steady
revival in building activity ; N. S. Wales
last term showed a substantial recovery,
too. Work in that State has been re-
sumed on several large undertakings,
such as the Mitta Mitta, Nepean and
Wyangala dams, and private sales have
been much better. The State’s outturn
of cement for the year to Dec. 31 was
231.000 tons, as against 177,000 tons in
the previous period. Still, that was little
more than the capacity of the Kandos
plant alone. During the current year
the Kandos Co. should get a bigger share
of the N. S. Wales business; it has
secured portion of the Government con-
tract.
This is as much as can be seen of the
finances from Australian Cement share-
holders’ point of view:

Besides the 1,000,000 £1 shares in the
operating co. (shown at par), there are
26.000 shares in the Stream-Line Filter
Co. (£16,168), a small holding (£3750) in
Bates (A’asia) and £3520 in Common-
wealth securities. The directors antici-
pate improved returns from the Stream-
Line Co.
The market prices the pound shares at
255., as against 245. 12 months ago. The
return is 4.8 p.c. on a 6 p.c. div. basis, and
the visible backing 275. Bd. in net assets,
mainly plant in the operating co., worth
what it can be made to earn.

The last two years have been profitable,
following a change in management three
years ago, when Thomas Campbell, for-
merly of Wunderlichs, took charge.
Fowlers make bricks, tiles and pottery at
Marrickville and Hornsby (N.S.W.) and
Thomastown (Vic.), and are at the mercy
of the trends in building activity. These
have shown definite improvement over the
past 12 months. But the co. was carry-
ing the burden of overvalued plant and
subsidiary investments, and during last
term the losses of previous years and the
slack in book values were taken up;
£lOO,OOO, representing Bs. per ord. share,
was cut off capital.
Pref. shareholders, on their part, have
said good-bye to £14,000 of div. arrears,
and have agreed to a reduction of 3 p.c.
(to 7 p.c.) in their div. rate, with the right
to participate with the ords. up to their
old rate.
With the finances more shipshape, the
term to Sept. 30 last finished with a profit
of £12,098, an improvement of £7946
over the previous year. Stock was taken
at £2,156 lower. The showing was equal
to 6.3 p.c. on capital, and, after handing
the prefs. 7 p.c. and 2 p.c. to the ords.,
£6173 was left to form the nucleus of a
reserve fund. After a six years’ drought
it is encouraging to the ords. The prefs.
have gone without for 34 years.

ment apart from the writing-down:

The debt, which had hitherto been show-
ing signs of becoming unmanageable, was
reduced by no less than £18,761 (to
£68,379) during the term. Drops of
£39,272 in freehold and plant and £32,360
in shares in other cos. (mainly R. Fowler
Vianini, Ltd.) reflect the writing-down
operations. The accounts show an in-
crease of £3863 in the more or less liquid
surplus (£5476); the real improvement
was probably better.
Governments are going ahead with
sewerage schemes, and building trades
are optimistic, in spite of the fall in
wool. The market, encouraged by the
co.’s recovery, pays 235. 6d. for the 7 p.c.
cum. prefs. and 10s. for the 12s. ords.

There was a drop of £3594 in sales
(£132,260) when measured against the
previous year’s turnover, which had been
the best since 1928. But compared with
the boom days the management has things
better controlled. Expenses of manufac-
ture and raw materials, etc. (£132,752),
were £6BB lighter, including an unspeci-
fied amount for depreciation ; after valu-
ing finished goods and work in progress
(£38,947) at £7433 more, the year’s net
result was £1520 lower at £8394.
Stocks, a vital item with wool prices
uncertain, are said to have been taken
into account on present values, and are
“practically disposed of for forward de-
livery.” Which removes any anxiety on
that score. Raw materials, etc., figure at
only £13,917. The factory is being kept
fairly busy at the moment, but competi-
tion is reported keen.
During 1930-31 no depreciation was
charged. But in 1930 a share premium
reserve of £27,474 was written off fixed
assets. During the present comparative
prosperity the management has made no
mistake ; the book value of plant has
dropped £16,558 over the last two years;

than they were ; the more or less liquid
surplus (£57,549, including stocks) was
£4325 stronger than at the previous bal-
ance, an improvement of £12,332 since
1929. The co. is in better trim now than

This co. has small visible reserves for
a financial concern, and earnings have
been susceptible to slump conditions.
Business is not strictly confined to the
three-ball trade; mortgages are given
first place amongst the securities in the
balance sheet. The moratorium and de-
clines in property values have assailed
both earnings and reserves ; £12,000 has
been taken from the visible lay-by over
the past four years to provide for bad
debts, etc.
The co. is established in Sydney, Parra-
matta, Newcastle, Cessnock and Wollon-
gong (N.S.W.), and Melbourne and
Brisbane. The pawnbroking business has
been extended of recent years by the
opening of new city branches.
Interest, rents and profits from
branches (less bad debts and interest
paid) last term brought in £3830 more.
Exes. (£14,195) were cut back £2998, after
making “ample provision for slow and
inoperative accounts.” Net profit (£14,204)
was nearly double the previous term’s at
4.7 p.c. on capital, compared with 2.4
and 2.3 p.c. in the two preceding years.
The 4.3 p.c. handed to shareholders left
£1079 for reserves (£38,350); it is the
first time in three years that the div.
rate has been covered by earnings.
The slide in income has been mainly
due to a proportion of the interest being
treated as irrecoverable, to a more conser-
vative lending policy, and interest-reduc-
tion. The outlook for the next 12 months
is brighter; it is doubtful, though.
whether much better than 5 or 6 p.c. can
be looked for in the immediate future.
A good deal will depend on the extent or
otherwise of the co.’s undisclosed
strength.
Whatever improvement there was in
conditions last year did not tempt the
management:

Advances, etc. (£255,140), dropped a
further £2035, and an extra £7091 of
cash piled up. The co. is in a strong
position to take advantage of any im-
provement in conditions.
It will be interesting to see how Mont
de Piete fares compared with cash-order
cos. The latter, though they charge high
interest, allow the security (if any) to
remain in the possession of the borrower ;
the pawnbroker, generally speaking, de-
mands possession. That is one thing
which operates against this co. in com-
petition with concerns going in for the
pay-as-you-use system.
At 235. 9d. the £1 shares return 4.2
p.c. on a 5 p.c. div. basis, and the visible
backing is 225. 7d. in net tangibles.

N. S. Wales coal cos. are indulging in
a fierce price-war, particularly apparent
when large contracts are tendered for.
Prices quoted for railway coal border
on recklessness. Cos. which submit ten-
ders that will show a margin of profit are
left out in the cold.
Invincible works the Lithgow seam at
Cullen Bullen, on the western N. S. Wales
field. It is thus particularly well situated
for supplying fuel for the western rail-
way system, the electric power plant at
Lithgow and other handy manufacturers.
But though it delivered a fair quantity
of railway coal last year, and raised 3825
tons more (the year’s output being
148,693 tons), the result for the term was
a loss of £1271, a slip of £1466 com-
pared with the previous year. Share-
holders (mainly Howard Smith, Ltd.)
went without for the fourth time since
1930.
For the current term the outlook is
even less cheerful. Though the railway
contract in 1934 was for nearly 150,000
tons, this year the co. has secured an
order for only 12,000 tons, so severe has
the price-cutting been.
Comfortable finances are the most
pleasant part of the picture;
1927. 1930. 1933. 1934.

The more or less liquid surplus improved
£1072, despite the adverse trading. Fixed
assets (£95,284) moved down £2017,
showing that depreciation has not been
overlooked.
The coal trade is likely to be in the
doldrums indefinitely. Depression has
affected factories, railway activity, gas-
making and electricity consumption. The
growing popularity of motor-vessels and
oil-burners —three new motor-vessels for
the Australian coastal trade are now in
course of completion in England—have
seriously hit bunkering outputs. The 1929
disturbance at Maitland lost for us most
of our overseas connections; then depres-
sion came along and aggravated the crisis.
The outlook is not quite as bad as it was,

Invincible’s scrip is not active on the

Sulphide Gold (Junction Reefs), Ltd.
Tom Owen, chairman of this co., which
is working three properties at Mandu-
rama (N.S.W.), told shareholders that,
although only 4576 tons of ore was
treated for a profit of £lOBl in the co.’s
last year, the weekly tonnage had since
moved up from 91 to 177 tons, and
the profit from £lOBl for the year to
£1389 for the last 12 weeks. Costs have
been reduced to 295. per ton, and a
further decrease is expected. It is pro-
posed to run the plant at its full capacity
of about 700 tons per month, and supply
it with ore at a grade of about Bdwt.,
mined partly from the Sulphide section,
where it is necessary to continue work in
order to reach the better grade ores be-
lieved to lie ahead of the present faces,
and partly from Sheahan’s section, where
high-grade ore is now ready for sloping.
The Sulphide mine and Sheahan’s sec-
tion will continue to be developed, parti-
cularly the promising areas west of the
dyke in Sulphide. The Belubula property
will also be worked.
The co.’s original holdings covered the
ore-bodies in the sulphide section of the
Junction Reefs goldfield. These deposits
exist in this field as beds of ore some-
what similar in stratification to coal
seams. The beds are distributed over
many acres; payable values, however,
are usually confined to the zones adja-
cent to certain volcanic dyke rocks which
have penetrated upwards through the
beds. Values are spread rather errati-
cally through the ore, and though very
large tonnages are known carrying about
3dwt. of gold, the bodies carrying over
sdwt. or 6dwt. are often difficult to
locate.
In the recently acquired Sheahan’s
section the returns have been consistently
good, latest assays from the 6ft. bed
going 7.5, 15.8, 11.2 and 17.6dwt, In
20ft. bed (old slope) 38dwt. values have
been recovered. The Sheahan property
is opening up promisingly.
Most spectacular mining stock on
Sydney ’Change in the New Year has
been Cullengoral Alluvial Gold Sluic-
ing, N.L. The Is. 6d. ord. shares
jumped from 6s. 6d. a little over
a month ago to above 285,, and at
last week-end were around 275. 3d.
The properties are near Gulgong, on
the Cudgegong River (N.S.W.). Aus-
tral Malay Tin had an option over
1000 acres of the co.’s property, and re-
cently abandoned it; the market’s ap-
praisement of the co.’s prospects mainly
relate to its other interests, including 650
acres of dredging area and a detached
holding of deep-lead character. About
50 acres of the middle section of Cul-
lengoral leases was bored, and during
December a deep-cut was being made
across a further 100 acres. Though this
work was not complete at date of the
co.’s last report, it was estimated that
ground with an average depth of 27ft.
contained 6,000,000 c.y. of 2s. wash.
Close-boring of the remainder of the
650 acres is now to go on, scout bores
suggesting an additional 20,000,000 c.y.
of payable ground. In the deep leads
wash showing to the yard is re-
ported, while black sands encountered in
all deposits, after extracting free gold,
have shown, under independent assay, 6oz.
to 220 z. per ton of sand. No estimates
of costs were given in the last report,
nor had the testing been then completed.
The figures, then, are approximate, but
look very promising. The market’s price
of 75,000 ords. paid to Is 6d. is specu-
lative, and the same applies to the 21,000
prefs. fully-paid to 4s. There are also
24,000 f.-p. ords. of 4s. each.

Because the four-hour shift on Satur-
day mornings was considered uneco-
nomic, the 88-hour fortnight introduced
to the Westralian mining industry was
to be worked in alternate 48- and 40-hour
weeks. The miners in all the principal
shows in Westralia (except the Norse-
man) have struck; Norseman is still
being worked on a 44-hour week basis,
a nd a few small shows on the Golden
Mile are carrying on. About 6000 men
are directly out of work as a result of
the stoppage, and at the end of last week
the loss to the State in gold production
was put at £65,000.

The two Associateds —offshoots of the
old Associated Gold Mines of W.A.—-
have signed, sealed and delivered their
fusion. Years ago the old Associated,
growing wealthy from production of Kal-
goorlie gold, extended its interests to
Canada, and it was found desirable
that the two should be segregated.
Associated (New) of W.A. and Asso-
ciated Mining and Finance (now merged)
resulted. Before they recently came to-
gether again a further change occurred.
The Westralian co. sold its property for
Lake View shares and ceased to operate
mines. With the two cos. performing
almost parallel functions coalescence sug-
gested itself. The amalgamated co. has
a capital of £333,800 and investments
(apart from £109,000 cash) worth about
£460,000. A large proportion is in high-
grade gold shares, the great majority
paying divs.

Golden Valley, Kanowna (W.A.), has
unwatered its No. 1 shaft to the 160 ft.
level. In No. 2 shaft the ladderway has
been cleaned out to a depth of 142 ft.,
and “the timbers are in sufficiently good
condition to indicate that the damaged
section of the shaft has been passed.” A
few feet further is to be sunk before re-
conditioning commences. Golden Valley
was one of the last successful floats in
1934 ; the 600,000 2s. shares offered went
like hot cakes. The vendors took £13,000
in cash and 70,000 fully-paids, leaving
£47,000 in the till for mine development,
etc. The proposition was favorably com-
mented on by H. E. Vail, of Wiluna, J.
Trenfield and W. J. Cummings. In the
old days 15,591 tons was treated for
10,4470 z., and something like 3dwt. to
4dwt. was left in the residues.

Hill 50 Gold Mine, N.L., working a
show three miles east of Mt. Magnet,
was registered in Perth on May 16, 1934.
Paid capital is £25,000, out of which the
vendors took £9OOO in cash. Sinking of
the main shaft has been resumed, and the
north drive (No. 1 level) has been tim-
bered to 127 ft. Samplings on the 124 ft.
level have not been disclosed, but an
engineer recently sent over by Melbourne
interests estimates a considerable body
of ore in the show going 9dwt. Rock-
drilling will start when No. 1 level is
cleaned up and the accumulated ore and
mullock is hauled to surface.
* * * *
Western Queen, 70 miles n.-e. of Mt.
Magnet, is in the same stable as Hill 50,
The show was registered in July last,
paid capital being £50,000. The vendors
were paid £2500 cash and receive £l2O
a month during continuance of the
option, total consideration if this is exer-
cised being £30,000. Main question at
the moment is whether the ore-body lives
and maintains its values in the sulphide
zone. The co. has up to April next to
find this out. Its main hope is that a
large body of remunerative ore will be
found on the 200 ft. level. In the east
crosscut off the main shaft the lode for-
mation passed through during December
was very disturbed through the intrusion
of pegmatite bars, and carried low values.

Gambier Lass G. M. Co., N.L., nomi-
nal capital £50,000 in 400,000 2s. 6d.
shares, is asking the public for £30,000
to float the Gambier Lass mine, 12 miles
from Leonora (W.A.). The property
(39 acres) was worked from 1903 to 1913,
the workings going down to 250 ft., Mines
Department records showing crushings
of 8736 tons for 80740 z., exclusive of
sands. The vendors take £15,000, half
in cash, the remainder in fully-paids.
The directors may go to allotment on
120,000 shares.

In the Moonlight group at Wiluna
(W.A.), owned by Gold Fields Aust. De-
velopment Co., and controlled by the same
crowd that dominates the boards of the
Wiluna Corporation and Lake View,
there seems to be the makings of a good
mine. Big bodies of payable ore have
been cut by the drill and proved by cross-
cuts, while shoots are lengthening at
depth. Moonlight is working a parallel
formation to that from which the big
Wiluna co.’s gold comes from,

Westralia’s gold yield still rises. That
for 1934 was worth over £5,500,000 in
Australian currency. Assisted by new
additions to the list and increases from
those already on it, production in 1935
shopld get an even bigger lift —unless
unionism goes off its head. In addi-
tion to an outlay of hundreds of thou-
sands of pounds on new plant and
special development by the big old-estab
lished cos. at Kalgoorlie and elsewhere,
hundreds of thousands more have been
spent in the last 12 months on prospect-
ing, developing and equipping goldmin-
ing properties in the State.

“Old-timer”: The old Gympie gold-
field opens the New Year with every
prospect of a healthy revival. Work at
the northern end in the New Gympie
mine proceeds rapidly now that water
trouble has been overcome. The shaft
has intersected the top of Phoenix slates
at 345 ft., and will proceed to the bottom
of this formation (somewhere about
460 ft.) before crosscutting to test the
numerous reefs which exist in the prop-
erty —three reefs have already been
proved in the shaft.
Work of shaft-sinking has been com-
menced to the east of the New Gympie
mine by a Sydney co., North Gympie
Gold Deposits, and an effort is being
made to raise capital in London to push
on with prospecting. The slates lie at
somewhere round 500 ft. where the shaft
is situated. At the southern end of field
a group of leases taken up by W. H.
Reeve have been acquired by the
Gympie Sovereign Syndicate. This prop-
erty, comprising over 100 acres, lies
in a virgin area south of Inglewood
crosscourse, and in a direct line with
the Monkland’s richest reefs, A contract
has been let for diamond-drilling;
the plant is now at the bore-site and
should start work early in January. It
is anticipated that 500 feet of boring will
prove the Monkland slate horizon.
Rather complex faulting of reefs and
strata, combined with a misconception or
the influence of the Inglewood fault,
has caused this area to be left alone in
the past. The Queensland Geological
Survey (L. C. Ball and I. H. Reid) drew
special attention to the area in a report.

Olympic Tyre and Rubber Co., formed
in August, 1933, has declared an interim
div. of 5 p.c. p.a., payable Jan. 31. The
co. began 16 months ago with Frank
Beaurepaire, the swimmer, as manager.
A factory was started on in October
that year at West Footscray, Melbourne.
An up-to-date plant was soon in opera-
tion, and experimental production and the
testing of tyres were completed by the
end of March; tyres were offered to
the public in April, 1934. The div. is
an interim, so no other figures accom-
pany it. If it has been declared after
prudent provision for contingencies it is a
remarkable performance.

SHREDDED WHEATMEAL BISCUITS
MOST VALUABLE, DELICIOUS AND EASILY DIGESTED
Try also SAVOURETTE and GINGER NUT BISCUITS
SHADOW SHOWS.
“Java Head”
Hergesheimer’s novel doesn’t suit the
film. He elaborates his characterisation
by a hundred little incidents. The film
and the drama must develop their char-
acters by a few clean, masterful cuts.
These are lacking in the talkie produced
at Melbourne Majestic. It is a well-
acted, well-photographed show, and the
scenes of old English villages and man-
sions and streets and ships are excellently
presented. The trouble is the lack of
humor —there is not one note of relief —
and the common British failure to put
together a plot convincingly.
Edmund Gwenn would sweep the world
as Arliss did if Hollywood only tempted
him across. He carries nearly the whole
burden of “Java Head,” and never has
to draw a quick breath. As the old sea-
dog who has grown to be an owner, he
recalls Kipling’s Anthony Gloster, and in
his fight against his progressive son, who
not only believes in “herring-gutted
clippers” but even in that atrocity a
steamship, he rises to great dramatic
heights.
“Winter Cinders”
A wild farce, British in origin but over-
laid by American situations, American
vernacular and in some of the characters
American accent. It is the story of a
male Cinderella and a female variant of
the hero in “She Stoops to Conquer,”
and is amusing on the whole.
“The Queen’s Affair”
A Melbourne Athenaeum comedy. The
republicans in a Central European mon-
archy conspire so successfully and preach
bloodshed so fiercely from their soap-
boxes that the populace rises and sends
queen—young, single and attractive —
over the border. The conspirators who
haven’t been made dictator want the
dictator’s job, and he is persuaded to feign
illness and go into smoke. On the train
he encounters the deposed queen, who
has tired of being fussed over. But their
love story is subsidiary to the satire,
which pricks the painted bladders of
ostentation in a truly comic spirit.
Anna Neagle is the queen, Fernand
Graavey the dictator and Muriel Asked
the ultra-loyal lady-in-waiting.
“Lilies of the Field”
On the same programme is “Lilies of
the Field,” another satire—this time

directed at the fads of the London smart
set. To win the right to enjoy a holiday
in London, the flapper daughter of a
vicar in an English village dresses in the
clothing of the ’seventies and behaves as
the present generation believes the re-
fined young ladies of the ’eighties be-
haved. She has to continue the imper-
sonation when she gets into London
society, and, though she raises smiles at
her first appearance, the crowd remains
to worship, and she finds herself the

leader of a movement to restore Vic-
torianism. Before all the flappers are in
crinolines and all the smart men have
grown side-whiskers and everybody’s be-
havior is so dull that they die of bore-
dom, the truth comes out and she finds
that the man she loves has known of her
duplicity all along.
A thin plot but excellent entertain-
ment, with a certain grim brutality
directed at the craze of the smart for
something new. Winifred Shotter is
practically the whole outfit.
“You Belong to Me”
Another back-stager. Helen Mack is
a soubrette, widowed, with child (David
Holt). Lee Tracy, an alcoholist, wist-
fully separated from his wife (a singer
whose name helps to illuminate Broad-
way), hovers in the background as the
kindly friend. Miss Mack marries a
male hoofer who objects to the kid and
treats her unkindly. Close-ups of kid
crying himself to sleep. Eventually the
hoofer gets tired of Miss Mack, who
thereupon crashes to death during a
swing-song act. So Tracy adopts the kid,
thereby paving the way to reconciliation
with the Broadway lady.
Tracy as a wisecracker is a ray of sun-
shine ; as a person who habitually over-
works his remarkably prominent epi-
glottis in emotions too deep for words he
is one degree more depressing than a wet
Sydney summer. Sydney Capitol sus-
tains this tearful epic.
“Gambling”
George M. Cohan commenced his
career as a stage star in 1890, and be-
came a theatre proprietor and actor-
manager a quarter of a century ago. He
adapts books to plays, has a flair as a
musical composer (“Over There” was
his), and in his prime rubbed shoulders
with Belasco and towered over Ziegfeld
as an impresario. In an H. B. Franklin
talkie he is brought to the screen in an
adaptation of “Gambling,” which he
arranged for the stage some years ago,
and in which he played the leading role.
Cohan’s acting, transferred to the screen,
seems ineffably stagy. He overworks
his face, overdoes his gestures, and
almost, but not quite, waits for laughs.
But the part of A 1 Draper, proprietor of
a night club, suits him, and his love-
making to two ladies (Wynne Gibson
and Dorothy Burgess), whom he sus-
pects of being implicated in the murder
of his foster-daughter, is smooth and
clever. The play is competently con-
structed, and though the denouement
doesn’t ring true the old dog on the hard
road holds his audience. Seen at a pre-
view at Fox Theatrette, Sydney. To
be at Sydney Capitol on Friday.
“The Barretts of Wimpole Street”
A second inspection of Rudolf Besier’s
version of the courtship of Elizabeth
Barrett and Robert Browning—the screen
story closely follows the play—confirms
some impressions recorded in this page
by a previewer three weeks ago. Norma
Shearer is a little too healthy as the in-
valid poetess, Fredric March’s Ameri-
canisms spoil an otherwise capable per-
formance and Charles Laughton is a mag-
nificent libel on poor Papa Barrett. Apart
from these details, a couple of superfluous
scenes and the wedding scene the film is
unimpeachable. At Sydney St. James,
“Let’s Be Ritzy”
At Sydney Civic. In spite of the asinine
title this is an intelligent film —a study
of the mess young married people get
into when they live above their means.
Patricia Ellis is the extravagant little
wife who accepts a 5000-dollar bracelet
from a rich admirer in all innocence,
and Lew Ayres is the doting 30-dollar-a-
-week husband. Isabel Jewell and Frank
McHugh are the wisecracking friends
who always figure in American movies
on this theme,
Robert McQuade has the best lines
and situations as the millionaire who puts
things right at the finish. Beginning as
a raucous old pest who brags incessantly
about his celebrated ruthlessness, he
turns out to be a victim of fictional
matrimony’s deadliest sin—lack of trust
in woman. He suspected his wife as a
young man, and she died. Moral: Think
no ill of wives who pretend their gift-
bracelets are imitations.
Over-sentimentalised ; but also comic
and dramatic in spots.
“Whom the Gods Destroy”
In its absence of eroticism, its rich
Dickensian pathos and its edifying
domestic touches, this one belongs to a
purer, less sophisticated age than ours.
It is right up to date, however, as regards
its grand sensation —a painfully realistic
shipwreck in which the milling passen-
gers and sailors have been supremely
well handled.
Walter Connolly is a famous play-
wright and a loving husband and father

“The Barretts.”
who, after chivalrously giving away his
lifebelt after the collision, loses his nerve
and escapes in one of the ship’s boats
disguised as a woman. America im-
mortalises him as one who sacrificed his
life for another, and he lives in hiding
till his son grows up, becomes a play-
wright and needs expert help. The rest
writes itself.
It is practically all Connolly, and he
plays the part —a modernised version of
the Silver King with tremendous
earnestness. If you want to hear vowels
beautifully sounded and English per-
fectly articulated, listen to this American
actor. He is as educative as Laughton
himself.

translator was more conscientious than
poetic. Also, though the insinuation
may be quite unjustified, there was room
for a feeling that Verdi was not getting
as square a deal as the same organisa-
tion bestows on Wagner. Casting was
fair. Ben Williams carried himself
ducally and debonairly as the light-
hearted nobleman who carols about the
fickleness of women; Francesca Duret
was an adequately winsome Gilda,
though “Caro Nome” found a serrated
edge on some of her top notes. Mr.
Sydney de Vries seemed more interested
in the music than in the emotions of
the hunchback, and Norman Allin’s
Sparafucile had no more significance
than the scenery. The scenery, however,
was very prettily devised, and the cos-
tuming was effective. Robert Ainsworth
conducted, and never once did the
orchestra even threaten to drown the
singers. The boot, indeed, was on the
other foot.
* * *
“Nice Goings On” (book by Douglas
Furber, music by Arthur Schwartz) at-
tracted one of the largest first-night audi-
ences seen at the Sydney Cri. for many
a moon. Gus Bluett, who takes the
part of Olaf Henscuttle, a trod-upon
pen-driver in the Public Welfare De-
partment, “Somewhere Near Scandina-
via,” was one of the reasons. His playing
of Henscuttle, while not according to the
book —he is at his best when improvising
—and once or twice in dubious taste,
was a good piece of clowning. His re-
cital of the adventures of the night be-
fore, his handling of the nuisances who
invaded his office and his capers when,
disguised as a waiter, he investigates the
goings on at a seaside resort were
among the high-lights of his performance.
Eric Bush, who hitherto has been better
known as a dancer, made a good job of
the role of Paul Ginkler, which demands
ability as a singer and actor. Charles
Norman, Phil Smith, Fred Bonner,
George Moon and Don Nicol all evoked
chuckles, and Agnes Doyle, as a mis-
chievous flirt, was outstanding among the
women. Producer S. Albert Locke pro-
vided three very effective settings, and
Ruby Morriss, who had the arranging of
the ballets, presented a team of shapely
girls.

Our Real Position
For a country to be really prosperous
it is essential that its industries, or the
majority of them, should be on such a
basis as to be profitable to all those en-
gaeed therein, and this without Govern-
ment subsidies or other extraneous assis-
tance Let us see how ours stand;

Meanwhile, secondary industries insist
that they must have protective duties.
Previous depressions we got over by
reduction of producing costs. If our
wool, wheat and meat are worth only so
much in the world’s markets, we must
cut our costs (no matter whom it affects
or hurts) to such a figure as will enable
us to deliver the goods, give the workman
a living wage and leave a sufficient mar-
gin for management and capital. The cry
to-day from some quarters is “Cut down
interest.” This cutting down has gone

Press Picnics
Canada was the scene of one a few
years ago ; then Australia ; now it’s South
Africa’s turn. The taxpayer in each of
these countries has to foot the bill.
The business is engineered from Lon-
don by a body bearing the self-inflicted
and noble-sounding title of the Empire
Press Union. One of the most amusing
experiences that can befall a person who
has accepted the E.P.U. at its title-value
is to attend a meeting. The members
comprise two or three capable Londoners
and about 20 or 30 men of the calibre
of suburban councillors in any Austra-
lian city—men who know nothing about
newspapers beyond having shares in the
East Winnipeg “Totem” or the Punkah-
pore “Bugle,” dividends from which
enable them to live in London. The dis-
cussions are usually about nothing in
particular, and in the ordinary course of
journalism they would not be reported.
Governments which finance the periodi-
cal picnics are simply throwing away
public money. One of these days some
legislator will have the execrable taste
to ask questions regarding the cost of
these jaunts and the advantages gained
from them. The replies will be interesting.

Out on the Daly
Out on the Daly, on the remotest,
wettest coast-region settlement in the
Northern Territory, 18 white men, one
white woman and two Chinamen are
growing peanuts. The Maroubra, the
magnificent museum piece of naval
marine architecture which serves those
parts, has been on a sandbank in the
Victoria River. The population, out of
other rations, has been eating peanuts,
the rains are coming on, and if the
Maroubra doesn’t get off the bank or
Providence send a shower of kerosene in
time to allow tractor work to be done,
there will not be much crop next year.
For 20 years there has been a persis-
tent demand for a reasonably fast, safe
ship to be stationed at Darwin which
could act as a patrol boat and see that
these brave outside selectors are not out
of rations in the monsoon season. But
nothing so far has come of it, though a
few derelicts have been bought and
scrapped, and there are heaps of pro-
mises.—E. M. H. (N.T.).


ABORIGINALITIES
“F.A.4”: “What is a stock-
man?” I was asked recently;
and I had to reply that I
couldn’t say offhand. But, giv-
ing the word its widest mean-
ing, here’s some of the things
a stockman must know and be
these days. He must hdve an
intimate acquaintance with the
habits of horses, cattle and sheep.
He must know various types of
country and its carrying capacity (that
means a knowledge of grasses of
all sorts and edible shrubs) and be
wise to methods of water-raising and
-storing. He must be a bit of a black-
smith, plumber, fitter, motor-mechanic,
carpenter, saddler, butcher, engine-driver,
axeman, roughrider, drover, fencer, yard-
builder, horse-driver, vet., woolclasser.
shearer, rouseabout, surveyor, lawyer,
doctor, book-keeper, banker, business-
man, parson and weather prophet. But
that’s not all; on some places he’s ex-
pected to be a ropemaker and splicer, a
dam-sinker, a stone-pitcher, a concrete-
worker, a timber-getter, carrier, laundry-
man, gardener, painter, grocer, cook,
typist, tailor and J.P. And he has it in
him to be a good husband and father,
but how can he find the time?
* * * *
“Tarboy”; There have been com-
plaints about the careless packing of
Australian wool, and a recent discovery
in Sydney gives some justification for the
grouse. A bale was being unpacked in
one of the Balmain wool stores when a
hen and her clutch of eggs were found in
the middle of it. The hen had long since
joined the great majority, but the eggs
were outwardly normal, though no one
investigated further. How the fowl got
there with a full clutch of eggs has got
everyone gravelled. One theory is that
a half-filled bale was left in the press
from the previous season and that this
was filled and pressed the next.
* * * *
“Jacky Roo” (Canada); Here’s some-
thing for the Abo. Council to fight over.
H, E. Anthony, curator in the American
Museum of Natural History, has told the
Royal Canadian Institute in Toronto that
he believes the natives of Ecuador origi-
nally went to South America from Aus-
tralia. He said he unearthed a skull in
Ecuador greatly resembling an Austra-
lian abo.’s headpiece.

“Lex L.”: Have just spent one whole
day clambering over the high sides of
Bar Mountain (Hawkesbury River,
N.S.W.) looking for a white waratah.
I didn’t find it —or rather refind it. It
is nearly 16 years since the white waratah
of Bar Mountain was first discovered
by my sister and party. Three years
later I visited the high ridge on which
the plant grew and had the satisfaction
of seeing the white flower. In the two
seasons following it did not bloom. But
in 1926 I met a fisherman on the river
who told me with great excitement that
he had found, a few weeks before, a
white waratah on Bar Mountain. I am
satisfied on this evidence that the white
waratah of Bar Mountain is, or was, a
true type, and not merely a freak albino
of one season’s showing.
* * * *
“Notaden”: Nothing to be surprised at
in finding a 23-foot shark in M.L. waters
(B. 26/12/’34), nor yet in temperate
waters anywhere. The white shark (Car-
charodon) runs up to 40 feet, and cruises
in all the warm and temperate seas of
the world. Sharks up to sft. and 6ft.
are often very troublesome to the herring-
netters in the English Channel and
North Sea ; bigger ones are not seldom
caught off the Cornish coast. During
the Antarctic summer, when the seas are
a perfect soup of small marine life,
attracting hungry visitors of all kinds
from whalebone whales down, sharks
cruise nearly down to the ice cap. I
have caught an Bft. tiger shark in Black-
man’s Bay (S. Tas.), and seen others
even larger in the same locality.

“J.R.D.”: Will Aboliars who coritend

“Wouldn’t it be lovely, mother, to go on one of those luxury cruises?”
amble (N.S.W.) way a 4ft. brown beat me
to a small dead wilga and disappeared in
a hole at the base of the trunk. I
gradually dismembered the wilga—
slightly hollow —without spotting the
wriggler. Then the last dead branch in
my hand seemed unnecessarily heavy.
I broke it in two and found the pieces
still hinged together by snake ; it com-
pletely filled the straight pipe, which
wasn’t much more than half an inch in
diameter, and only a pinhole at the top.
Anything but one-way traffic was im-
possible.
* * * *
“Shellback”: The cause of the trouble
at “Fitzmort’s” picnic (B. 19/12/’34)
was that the fire, lighted on one part of
the concrete floor, caused unequal ex-
pansion to take place, and up she went.
If the fire had covered the whole slab
there wouldn’t have been an explosion.
If “Fitz” goes fishing at the foot of
sea cliffs, he’s in for another blow-up if
he lights a fire on the salty rocks.
* * * *
“Groper”: Westralian wildflowers
mostly have no scent; the notable ex-
ception is the boronia, which probably
makes up for the others. The gorgeous
spider-orchid, taken singly, seems scent-
less, though a bunch will give off a faint
but quite noticeable perfume. One may
pass through acres of tall kangaroo-
paws and vividly-blue leschenaultia with-
out receiving the faintest hint of frag-
rance. Against these is a tiny blue flower
which grows on the river flats of the
Darling Ranges; it gives out a scent
so sickly-sweet as almost to turn the
stomach. A rarer blossom is a yellow
bell, not unlike a narcissus, which lures
flies to an early death. Foul-smelling
beyond belief whilst alive, it becomes
quite odorless when dried and pressed.
* * * *,
“Verri”: In the swift-growth section 1
enter an oak-tree that spent the first 20
years of its life in a small pot, the idea
being to dwarf it in the Japanese manner.
Then along came a dendrologist who
descanted on cruelty to trees, so the tiny
tree was transferred to the garden. In
its 20 years of suppression it must have
stored tremendous reserve strength, for
its upward growth was phenomenal, par-
ticularly as the oak is not a fast grower.
In two years the thing was 20ft. high ;
but height was its only virtue. The
stout branching of even a young normal
oak was entirely absent.
* * * *
“Makaira”; Yes, whales are con-
founded nuisances to those who go
down upon the sea in small craft (B.
19 /12 / ’34). They are so very large and
so very clumsy. “Government Gazettes”
in Hobart of a century ago and less con-
tain many warnings to look out for
whales when using the Derwent in boats,
and not a few notices of loss of life. The
finest extempore effort in sea-language
that I ever heard was when the Customs
launch nosed out of Williamstown (Vic.)
on a foggy morning with “Lanty”
O’Brien in charge. Feeling her way
round the Railway Pier, the launch
bumped suddenly, and a noise like the
watery beginning of the old-style siren
whistle broke the wet, lonely silence.
When “Lanty’s” explosion was over, and
we, unsunk, watched and waited, there
came another hissing blast: “An’ I
wasted all that on a whale!”
* * * *
“Ex-Croweater”: Those staghounds
(B. 2/1 / ’35) recall a wild night at
Terowie (S.A.) when the railway gang
I was in had to tranship a truckload of
mongs. It was-the strangest assortment
of dogs ever collected in one place, and
embraced all possible and impossible
types and breeds. In our innocence we
opened the door and whistled to ’em ;
they burst out of that truck as Lawson’s
bushmen burst out of the pub when the
loaded dog ran underneath it. Every hand
was pressed into service that night, and
finally we got about three-parts of them
into the narrow-gauge truck. The con-
signment had been gathered from Adel-
aide streets on behalf of a squatter up
Quorn way, who let ’em loose on his
place to clean out rabbits. But sheep
were easier to catch, and the mongs had
a royal time until the cursing squatter
armed his men with shotguns. That was
in 1921, and in Terowie to this day they
can point to incredible crossbreds on the
street and tell you how their ancestors
came to town.
* * Hi *
“Atrax”: It was not death—something
quite different —that the tapping of those
death beetles in the bush hut heralded
(B. 2/1 /’35). The superstitious swaggie
who bolted next morning was running
away from a wedding, not a funeral.
According to the entomologists, whom
mere outsiders are not in a position to
contradict, the tapping is the tip from
the lady beetle to her boy friend that
she is waiting beneath the beetle equiva-
lent of the silv’ry moon.
* * # *
“Inglegar”: The age of chivalry still
lives. While 1 was removing a litter of
anted wood a queen termite, easily recog-
nisable by her abnormally large, dis-
tended body, was revealed. Not an ant
gave a thought to its own well-being.
They hurled themselves on their queen
and clung to her with the tenacity of
Roman legionaries.
* * * *
“Brach”: Please impress on “Splodger”
and others (B. 2/1 / ’35) that the hounds
once popular in western Queensland
as dingo hunters were not staghounds,
but deerhounds. No two breeds are
more unlike. The staghound is an
overgrown foxhound —overgrown pup-
pies in a new foxhound entry are
generally culled out for the “stagger”
packs—and hunts by scent, giving tongue
the while. The deerhound resembles a
larger and more muscular greyhound,
and his hairy coat is brindle in color.
Further, in the years I knew these dogs
I never heard one bark. He has a good
nose, but hunts by sight alone, his speed
and great strength making him a for-
midable proposition for the prey. He
is still used in Scotland to run down and
pin deer wounded by the stalkers. An
Irish cousin is very like him, but he is
degenerating to a show-bench dog.

“Hamer”: According to
David Uniapon, the blacks’
“bush telegraphy” is pure tele-
pathy. Black Brother, when
he sees a smoke signal or re-
ceives a message-stick, merely
accepts it as an indication that
someone afar off wishes to
yabber to him. He proceeds to
“tune in” telepathically by
pushing all mundane thoughts
out of his mind and making
himself receptive for the mes-
sage, which is duly received.
Each mark on the message-
stick may help to bring some-
thing to his mind, just as the
string around his finger re-
minds the white man of the
purchase he has to make for
the wife, with the difference,
of course, that he doth not ring
up his own memory or mind
but the mind of the person
who sent the stick. The abo.
has had a wilderness of hours
to develop a power which
needs spaciousness of time for
its development.
* * * *
“Tripod”: Naturalists have it that the
kookaburra belongs to the kingfisher
family ; I suspect a distant relationship
to the cuckoo. Have yet to see Jack build
a nest when that of a is avail-
able. Boring into it he carves out a
home in which Jill lays her eggs and
raises a family.

“G.M.”: Benalla and Wangaratta owe
their names to the bad writing of Sur-
veyor Wilmot, who laid out the towns in
the early days of Vic. The correct native
names of the two localities were respec-
tively Benalta and Wangaralta, but Wil-
mot’s writing was so illegible that the
draftsman who worked from his rough
notes mistook one t for an 1 and one 1 for
a t. Wilmot was the father of “Bung” Wil-
mot, secretary of Melbourne Athenaeum,
sporting writer (“Old Boy”) and old-time
Vic. League footballer.
* * *
“Preserve”: Maorilanders have long
been trying to acclimatise pheasants and
other English game. The Acclimatisation
Society is now up in arms because some
unprincipled ruffians, finding there is
money in it, have started pheasant yards,
and are breeding and selling the lordly
fowls to the detriment of all sporting
tradition as understood in the Old Coun-
try. As a matter of fact, more pheasants
are artificially hatched and reared in
England than ever see the light as wild
birds. True, they are not marketed direct
from breeding-pen to poulterer, being
first turned down in the coverts to be
shot by alleged sportsmen.
THE HARVEST.
Tis steaming here in Melbourne, and I’m lost
awhile in dreams
Where they’re getting, out the headers and
they’re yoking up the teams.
They’re feeding up at sunrise, then a load or
two of hay,
And they’re ready for the stripping and the
hot, long summer day.
Now I see it all before me, just as clear as
yonder train,
And I hear the steady buzzing of the teeth
beneath the grain,
And my thoughts go drifting northward to the
Malice’s dust and heat
And the welcome sight of sunset on the waving
yellow wheat.
To the poet’s eye ’tis pleasing, this romance of
fertile plains:
The rhythm of the horses as they answer to the
reins,
The bronzed and sinewy driver attired in dusty
rags,
The golden corn slow pouring to the new,
clean-smelling bags.
Yes, the poet sees the beauty of the fields at
early dawn,
With the dew-flecked tips a-whisper upon
generous Nature’s lawn;
And the balmy air of evening when the
twilight’s tender feet
Tread softly, softly westward over waving heads
of wheat.
In the city I am sleeping till the sun has risen
high,
And I seldom see the colors of the early-
morning sky.
Nostalgia sometimes gets me, but I hardly think
I’ll go
To the header and the horses and the dust that
rises slow,
For the city offers better when it comes to time
and pay
Than two quid a week and tucker and a
fourteen-hour day.
So I’m sticking to the office where a man get’s
time to eat —
Though I’d like to see the sunset on the waving
yellow wheat!
VICTORIA.

“Bundalinga”; A commercial traveller
who arrived in Young (N.S.W.) just in
advance of the grasshopper invasion
rushed from the meal he was eating to the
road, where he soon had an audience. He
led them across to his car. “Look at that
—they were six inches thick on the
radiator, stuck fast to the rims of the
wheels, all over the hood, the seats and
everywhere.” He took off his coat and
shook a minor swarm from it; his hat
also had its quota. Someone asked him
why he hadn’t finished his meal. “Like a
fool I ordered cold meat and salad,” he
said. “When I shook the salt over the
salad about a dozen ’hoppers came down
my sleeve on to the green stuff, and be-
fore I could get my fork into it they were
looking round for more.”
“Trion”; It isn’t that the flowering
gum isn’t appreciated in the Common-
wealth (B. 19/12/’34) that it doesn’t
figure more in tree-planting ceremonies.
It is a pernickety vegetable, and soil con-
ditions must be just right. Ma State’s
“What’s the matter, Jacky? Stomachache?”
“No, boss. Bellyache.”
National Rifle Association tried to grow
a memorial avenue of flowering gums at
Anzac Range. After ten years and a lot
ot expert cogitation it gave it up as a
ad job. Poor drainage was the big
trouble.

Billy See”: Snakes with legs! Both
paities in the debate are right. Accord-
lng to the theory of evolution, snakes are
leally reverted lizards, both birds and
reptiles having ascended from the fishes
as four-legged land animals. Thus the
unhatched embryos of all snakes will at
some period of development show dis-
tinct leg formations, though these may
be entirely absent in the adult. Humans
and apes show tails in just the same way,
and practically every doctor at some
time has come across adult humans with
distinct rudimentary formations still
existing. Whales and seals have legs—
modified into the present tail flukes —
which accounts for all sea mammals
having tails on the opposite angle to
those of true fishes.

“E.E.”: Meat and game do become
tainted by their food-supply (B.
26/12/’34). I once had a Jersey cow
whose milk was undrinkable after she
had been turned into a paddock lush
with milk thistles.
* * * *
“Ox.”: A Roseville (Sydney) man
caught a young ’possum in the near-by
bush. That evening he put the young-
ster on his verandah, where it began to
cry out. In the bush were heard the
rustling and crackling of twigs ; soon into
the lamp-light came Father and Mother
’Possum looking for the lost child. They
attempted to carry it away, but dropped
it after two or three yards, repeating
this procedure several times. The man
recaptured it and took it to his room to
test the parental affection further. He
was awakened later that night by Mister
and Missus ’Possum moving about in-
side ; this time they made off with their
offspring successfully.
* * * *
“Shellback”: “Bogaduck’s” much-
travelled ants (B. 12 /12 / ’34) were hikers
compared with a colony that used to live
aboard the Sydney ferry steamer Grey-
cliffe. They were the small black kind,
and the colony never seemed to increase
in size ; though we often tried to locate
their nest we never found it. Now and
then one of us would get nipped on the
leg or ear as a reminder that rations
were getting short, but a little sugar
sprinkled around would stop that. The
Greycliffe steamed over 30,000 miles a
year ; the ants were aboard her in 1917,
and they or their descendants were still
there when she was sunk by the Tahiti
in 1927. I know, because I gave them
their rations a couple of hours before
that tragic collision.
* * * *
“Mong.”: During the last 12 months
the roads and streets of Britain have
blossomed with
painted traffic lanes
inside which pedes-
trians are supposed
to cross in safety. It
has been noticed
lately that dogs,
even when unaccom-
panied by humans,
habitually use these
lanes when they cross
street or road. Also
it is alleged that
many of the hounds
are so self-educated
that no amount of
experimental per-
suasion will induce
them to cross else-
where than inside
the safety zones.
Lanes of the kind
have now been in
use in Sydney for
some little time. Any
Abo. observer
noticed whether the
local dogs are fol-
lowing the example
of their British
cobbers?

“New Moon”:
The practice of hang-
ing an empty bottle
to scare building
sparrows and swal-
1 o w s away (B.
26/12/’34) was, ac-
cording to my grand-
mother, a rule in the
North of Ireland for
centuries. Being a
teetotaller she used
to hang a lemonade-
bottle under our
verandah, but an
empty sauce-bottle
or jam-jar served as
well. Anything that
sways scares the birds. Incidentally, the
custom of wearing mint leaves in the top
of the stocking *to keep fleas away also
hails from the “black and bitter North.
“C.E.D.”: “Airline” (B. 26/12/’34)
says the goanna soon becomes domesti-
cated. He’s right. If you’re not careful
he’ll run the place. Was burning off
timber near Condobolin (N.S.W.) and
left a tin of jam on the table one night.
It was empty in the morning. We sus-
pected a half-wild cat, shot it, and went
to bed feeling secure. Next morning
the butter was gone, and its late recep-
tacle licked clean. Then we found Joey’s
tracks. He came down without touching
wood at all —I shook him from his perch
in a dead box-tree.

“Dungeness”: Beche -de - mer has
domestic merits other than being the
basis of an admirable soup. The water

as easy as this.”
in which the “fish” are boiled before
gutting and drying is far better than any
advertised compound for getting dirt and
grease out of clothing as a preliminary
to washing. Also, it will shift every
particle of verdigris from brass or
copper, and leave it with a brilliant shine.
That particular virtue caused Nicholas
the Greek in former days to ruin, for
quite a while, the market for red fish.
He boiled a few lots in a copper boiler,
and later on there was quite a consider-
able mortality amongst elderly epicures
in parts of China, where beche-de-mer
soup is believed to revive certain lost
attributes of youth, in addition to being
a favorite delicacy.
* * * *
“Lelaps”; Here’s a true dog story. For
some time my family and I have been
owned by two mongs —one a young and
flighty foxy, the other an old and wise
blue cattle-dog. The pair were great
chums, though the elder was a bit jeal-
ous of his smaller mate, and would give
him a hiding occasionally if he thought
he was being made too much of. The
other day the terrier was killed by a
motor-car. The elder dog didn’t see the
accident, but was present at the funeral.
Both dogs had been fed regularly once
a day and at the same time —in the even-
ing. For three days after the death of
his mate Bluey refused to touch his
tucker, though every effort was made to
coax him to eat. Then hunger prevailed,
and now he’s back on his normal diet.
How many humans woilld carry out a
three days’ fast because a friend had
been knocked out?

“Inglegar”: During a recent warm
spell at Thirroul (N.S.W.), when the flies
were particularly troublesome, a wild-
flower enthusiast placed in a jar in the
unused fireplace some fine sprays of the
white and rather fragrant logania. The
blossom was soon surrounded by dead
flies, and as long as the bloom was in
evidence the fly nuisance scarcely existed.
Any other Aboliar substantiate the
flower’s peculiarity?
* * * *
“Charnel”: Natural history of a sort
was made the other day’ in Cardiff
(N.S.W.) when an unattached camel
quartered himself on the community.
The easy-going Cardiffites didn’t greatly
bother until they found out that the brute
was even worse for the local gardens
than slugs or goats, fences being no
barrier to his long neck. Realising that
something had to be done, they com-
mitted the camel to the local pound. This
is claimed to be the first impounding of
the ship-of-the-desert in Australia, if not
in the world. Anybody knowing of
another instance is requested to testify.
“M.L.C.”: Eels don’t
migrate annually to the sea
to breed in the same way as
salmon do (B. 12/12/’34);
they are still to be found in
creeks during winter. Not
until the age of 10 to 14 years
does the wriggler migrate for
the first and only breeding
season. All European eels
travel by some extraordinary
instinct to their birthplace in
the far Western Atlantic be-
tween the West Indies and
Bermuda. American eels
journey to a neighboring
locality, and the two areas
overlap. Don’t know where
the Pacific spawning ground
is. It is known now that eels
breed in late winter, that the
larvae of the European eel
may be found at Gibraltar
by the end of the first year,
and at the end of the second
they are far up the Mediter-
ranean and off the west coast
of Europe. In the coastal
waters they are metamor-
phosed from a flat and leaf-
like creature to the serpen-
tine eel form. As they pass
up streams they gradually
become pigmented.

“Isee”: I’ll hand the prize to the
Papuan natives for sleeping. In the centre
of the floor of their sleeping houses they
build a fire on a clay bed ; this acts as
light and mosquito-scare. They lie
round it on mats, their pillows wooden
blocks about 6in. high, with part
hollowed out to fit the neck—just high
enough to keep their dandy mops of
hair from being crushed. Several times
the police “boys” on our station have
rolled over with one knee or foot in
the fire. A hole burned through the uni-
form and a bad flesh burn told the tale,
but the natives knew nothing of it till
morning. Then they would be fined for
disobeying orders and sleeping in their
clothes.
* * * *
“Canary Doctor”: Tell “Rindy” (B.
2/1 /’35), who complains of the ferocity
of his canary and, conversely, its palli-
ness with the cat, to let it chum up
with the latter. Let cat and canary have
a real heart-to-heart talk over the
matter, and he’ll have no canary trouble
after that.
* * * *
“Pagoda”: A. G. Peterson’s “Grass-
hoppers” (B. 26/12/’34) is excellent, but
the second slide shows pup, ram and dad
with their sterns facing the grasshopper
headwind, while the old moke is head-
on. My nags invariably about-turn in
heavy gales or sandstorms.
* * * *
“Cuchulain”: “Bogaduck’s” Murray
cod (B. 2/1 /’35) was not quite as big as
our Barwon (Q.) cod. Mick Leary said
they were the finest specimens he had
seen anywhere in Australia. When one
of the rams fell into the river a cod
snapped him up without difficulty except
for his horns—they were too wide. The
fish, with the horns curling picturesquely
from its mouth, was seen swimming
strongly for Mungindi three days later.
* * * *
“Lachlan”: Here’s something that
rivals either “Jimmac’s” emu or “Rindy’s”
magpie as a pet; it also makes a tastier
meal than either when the novelty wears
off. It’s the Murray cod. A yard of
strong cord, attached at one end to the
upper lip of the fish and at the other to
a strong stake, gives the fish a certain
amount of freedom. When scran is
abundant the cod, if left alone, will
quieten down and live indefinitely. He
has no objection to additional or varied
menu, accepting palatable food thrown
in the water to him. Unlike the emu
he won’t eat kitchenware, but like the
magpie he’ll tackle mice.

The slide was cut and fashioned from the

nasty spills, . .
The slide was never much the worse tor that.
We drew the wood for burning, and we took

£25 FOR SUCCESS STORIES.
Mostly Australia hears of her farming failures, but there are many men
on the land who have a romantic record of success—men who started out,
with little capital, on rough scrub land, and made good despite low prices,
bad communications and high taxes; men who bought properties on which
others had failed and made them pay; men who began with nothing but
stock knowledge as capital and turned it to good account; men to whom
pasture improvement has brought a competence.
“The Bulletin” is offering prizes for stories of success in any branch
of farming, written by the parties themselves or by others to whom the facts
have been communicated. If the latter, proofs of genuineness must be
furnished.
First prize £20
Second prize £3
Third prize £2
And ten “Bulletin” drawings by well-known artists. Space rates will
be paid for all non-prizewinning efforts published.
A story must not exceed eight hundred words in length. It must be
sent in an envelope addressed to the Editor and marked “Success Competition”
not later than January 31 next. The Editor’s decisions and awards will
be final.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
THE STUFFTO GIVE 'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
WHO GETS THE PROFIT?
“Valerin”: There is a feeling among
woolgrowers that the disparity of prices
between raw wool and the finished
article is brought about by inordinate
profits of intermediaries.
As a woolgrower with a working know-
ledge of manufacturing I disagree.
To make a suit of clothes costing
£8 8s. it takes 81b. of good-quality wool,
worth Is. to Is. 3d. per lb.
Scouring, carding, combing, dyeing,
drawing and spinning, warping, weaving
and finishing reduce the weight of the
suit-length to about 31b. The numerous
processes involve the use of costly and
delicate machinery and skilled operators,
under the control of expert supervisors.
Costs for power and the disposal of
waste are heavy.
The milling co, will be lucky to get 8s.
6d. per yard in the piece, which will
show a profit roughly of Is. per
yard. The return on capital employed,
after allowing for replacements, deprecia-
tion, etc., would be under 5 per cent.
There is no “understanding” between
Australian millowners, and prices are
being cut to the bone.
Practically all the large mills sell their
output to wholesalers, who sell to
retailers at a gross profit of about
33 per cent. Allowing for bad debts,
deferred payments, changes in fashion,
etc., the wholesalers are not making ex-
cessive profits, and many are having a
rocky time.
My 81b. of wool will cost the tailor
(plus sales tax) about 45s. Wages for
making a coat are £2 12s. 6d., plus vest
and trousers, £1 5s., lining, buttons,
thread, etc., say, 7s. 6d., which leaves the
tailor a profit in round figures of £2.
From this, rent, interest on stock, in-
surance, taxes, etc., have to be paid and
provision made for bad debts and the
slow payer—serious items in tailoring.
Propaganda against the manufacturer
and seller does harm to the grower, since
it directs attention from his more crush-
ing burdens —interest and taxation.
FLY-STRIKE AND WOOL-YOLK.
“Albarmount”: If the blowflies “strike
only on favorable ground” and depend
on bacteria set up in excess wool-yolk
for striking points, as “Square” (B.
2/1 /’35) says, ask him why they strike
freshly-washed blankets and dry wool on
six-months-old sheepskins. He does not
explain why the Central Plains (N.S.W.),
where there is less yolk in the wool, are
more troubled with' flies than the heavier
yolk-producing tablelands. The fly is not
fastidious.
“Valerin”: My experience is if rabbit-
burrows, hollow logs and other cover
are got rid of the blowfly pest can be
minimised. Carcasses of rabbits left rot-
ting about paddocks provide an ideal
breeding place for flies. Burrows and
hollow logs serve as a shelter for mil-
lions, which are thus enabled to escape
sudden climatic changes.
PIECE-PICKING.
“Toowong”: If “Marsh” (B. 19/12/’34)
had read my screed carefully he would
have seen that the discarded piece-picking
tables and the men were transferred to
the woolroom, thereby supplementing the
number of woolrollers dealing with the
fleeces.
I used the method for years at Coon-
goola (Q.) with a board of 54 shearers.
I found that in a day the woolrollers
were quite able to keep the untreated
fleeces from gathering, more especially
because the rams were always shorn first.
They got their hands in on comparatively
slow sheep. Mr. A. Hawkesworth, of the
Sydney Wool College, used the method
in those days, the only difference being
that he took a proportion of his students
to the sheds and placed one of them on
one side of the table, with the ordinary
woolroller on the other.
As to the men not being able to handle
the wool falling over the sides of the
tables, I have yet to learn that any fleece
can be properly skirted when partly
hanging.
By my method the process will cost no
more in labor, will make clean work a
certainty and leaves no arrears of wool on
the floor when the last fleece comes off the
board. I fear, however, that the method
will not appeal to the “rip-slash-and-tear”
school, in which get-up is regarded as
of secondary importance.
“Albarmount”: Despite “Right Angle”
(B. 2/1/’35), “Toowong’s” suggestion for
conjointly piece-picking and rolling a
fleece is good for small sheds. In two-
stand sheds, unless the shearers are fast,
one man can pick-up, roll and piece-
pick. The pieces are only handled once,
and with much tidier results. There is
no table piled with pieces waiting to de-
prive the owner-boss of his smoke-oh.
SELLING THE CLIPS.
“Small Woolgrower”: It’s a law (in
N.S.W., anyhow) that if a woolgrower
puts 10 per cent, of his wool into motion
for selling he can get all his clip cata-
logued in the same series or sale.
This is rough on the small man.
Living in New England (N.S.W.), I
can’t place my jumbucks till late
November. The wool will be sold in
March or April, and in the meantime I
find it necessary to stock up without
ready cash.
My neighbor, who is part-owner of
four or five places of some size and
shears the same month, sells all his wool
a fortnight after shearing here, because
his properties in the west, shearing in
June or July, have his percentages of
wool in hand to keep a place open.
Companies in Sydney disapprove of
selling in the shed, but many a small
woolman finds it pays him to take a
little less in the shed and have cash down
to go on with.
Why not sell each clip in its correct
order, and give the little ’un a look in?
LICE IN SHEEP.
“Valerin”: No need to leave N.S.W.
to find lice-infested sheep. P. P, Boards
can quarantine lousy sheep and order
them to be dipped, but it’s a regulation
better kept in the breach than the ob-
servance.
Unless strictly enforced and the job
efficiently done “compulsory dipping” is
of little use. Victoria brought in a sheep-
dipping Act in 1909, and has as many
lice-infested sheep as any other State.
To get results it is necessary tb:
(1) Use a poisonous-powder, dip. and
maintain it at full strength. The powder
remains in the wool much longer, than
liquid, and gets the young lice that hatch
out after dipping. , :> •
(2) Dip soon after shearing. Do it
again when the sheep are carrying from
two to three months’ growth. Success
depends entirely on the quantity of
dip the sheep take out in the wool,
(3) Do not try to break records in
dipping. A rush job is mostly a rotten
one ; a maximum of 3000 sheep is a good
day’s work, starting at daylight. This
means that every sheep has received a
thorough saturation and has drained
properly. ’
(4) Don’t allow the sheep to drain in
the hot sun or wind. There is ’ risk’of
scalding or of the moisture drying out
before its toxic qualities have had time
to get down on the skin where they are
wanted.
As dealers are the worst offenders, the
railway authorities should have their
sheep-vans properly cleansed, and the
P. P. Boards should insist on saleyards
being periodically disinfected with a
strong solution of dip.
CYPRUS AND THE ’HOPPER.
“Mattei”: There appears to be an idea
in some quarters that the gravity of the
grasshopper problem is “greatly exag-
gerated.” Anyone who has seen the
results of ’hopper visitation knows better,
and those who have experienced the pest
in other parts of the world affirm that
what we have had here is only a sample
of what can happen.
S’Africa has been periodically scourged
for centuries. There is a record of the
elements coming to the rescue there and
blowing the locusts out to sea. The ex-
tent of that swarm may be judged by the
fact that 50 miles of coastline were
banked four feet high with drowned
insects.
Cyprus, in the Mediterranean, measur-
ing about 140 miles by 60, affords the
classic example of anti-’hopper warfare.
Their existence menaced, the inhabitants
mobilised just when the insects were
hatching out. Long screens of canvas
and oilcloth 4ft. high were placed in the
path of the young ’hoppers, and at close
intervals along the screen pits were dug
and lined with zinc sheets. The ’hoppers,
unable to climb over the screen, crawled
along the base, to pile on top of one
another in the slippery-walled pits. It
was estimated that in one year 200,000
million locusts were thus destroyed at a
cost of 2s. a million. In a few years
the big swarms had vanished, and strict
preventive measures since have kept
Cyprus free of the pest.
The actual measures employed in
Cyprus could not be carried out in our
thinly-populated back country, but the
principle of compulsory national co-
operation in the destruction of the
swarms at the proper stage is the only
one on which the job can be tackled with
any hope of success.
“Wodao”: Near Dubbo it has been
found that the field-fly is killing grass-
hoppers. Some of the ’hoppers which
suddenly became sluggish were placed in
a box. They died, and from their
bodies grubs emerged which , developed
as flies. Has the locust met his Cacto-
blastis ?
FAT. PERCENTAGE OF MILK.
“Bahb Dwyer”; That the butter-fat
percentage of cows’ milk is determined
by . breeding amne and cannot be in-
fluenced by feeding is held by most
nutrition- authorities and dairymen.
Some, however, 1 aver that feeding has a
greater influence than breed, and recent
experiments at Minnesota ■ University
-(U.S.A.): support this view.
During six-day periods butter-fat, tal-
low, lard and vegetable oils were fed up
to 211 b. daily, and marked increases in
the butter-fat percentage, varying in
proportion to the amount of fat fed,
were recorded. This effect was obtained
whether the fat was added to an already
adequate ration or replaced an equiva-
lent amount of energy in the form of
starch. The increased fat percentage was
noted 12 to 24 hours after special feed-
ing commenced, and continued 30 to 42
hours after it stopped.
Of course, the experiment was incon-
clusive, as it does not tell us whether
.similar results could be expected for long
periods, whether the digestive system or
general health of the cows would be im-
paired or whether the increased fat paid
the extra cost of the supplementary
feeding.
Nevertheless, even a temporary in-
crease shows that permanent improve-
ment, possibly by injection as well as by
heavy fat feeding, might be attained.
BRIDLE-BREAKERS.
“Pine Spragg”: Sorry if I have to
differ from “Blister” (B. 26/12 /’34)
about there being no cure for old bridle-
breakers. In 30 years I’ve never known
this way to fail:
Put a running lassoo on the animal’s
flanks with the lead hanging dead centre
under the belly. Pass the end under the
cin<;h between the forelegs, through the
bit-ring and on to the snubbing-block.
Leave the rope knotted on the block
so that a single pull will untie it after
neddy has taken his cure.
Leave bridle-reins loose over the snub-
bing-block.
To make a young one stand bridle
down, use the same method with reins
atrail.
“W.D.McC.”: There is no certain
cure for the inveterate bridle-breaker.
Teaching a colt to pull back will only
result in his knocking himself about. A

method I have used for 40 years: After
having haltered or roped your colt in a
crush or catching yard make a figure eight
with a light rope heavier than a plough
line. Drop a loop over the colt’s quarters
(but not below his hocks). Have the knot
on top of the withers, and bring the two
ends on each side of the neck and knot
on the chest. Then take the shank of the
halter, and either put it through a ring
in a stout post or over and under a rail,
and make it fast to the figure eight at
the chest.
As soon as the colt moves he is caught
by the loop over his quarters, which acts
as a breeching. He immediately jumps
forward.
Leave him lied up and he will do the
rest himself, and won’t knock an acre of
skin off his head and legs. You can, by
this means, teach a colt that has never
been handled to lead well in less than an
hour. I have had them follow me in 20
minutes.
“Cuchulain”: It’s a good idea always
to have a small length of string when
riding a bridle-breaker. Tie him up with
the string to the reins, and then slip the
string over a twig or fence. It’s fright
that makes a horse into a bridle-breaker,
and the string will often keep him tied
up for the length of time wanted ; if
anything does startle the horse he is free
in an instant and the bridle remains
intact.
“El V.”: There is plenty of room for
difference of method, just as there is in
training humans. A horse fresh in from
the Flinders or the Kilgour needs dif-
ferent, handling from something brought
up in N. S. Wales paddocks. Generally,
however, a horse broken with a figure-
eight rope will not be a bridle-breaker.
I have seen this method Used with the
wildest colts of the Limmen without
injury to the animal and without its going
through a nightmare of terror or suffer-
ing pain.
CHRISTMAS AMONG THE WHEAT.
“Yalgogrin”: If you had been in West
Wyalong (N.S.W.) on Christmas Eve you
would have been pleasantly surprised. It
was difficult even in a side street to get
a span big enough to park a car in.
Although the wheat price is low the in-
dustry still pays everyone but the farmer.
But grasshoppers have taken a big
toll—in the Ungarie police patrol, which
is the second-largest in the State, not less
than 33 per cent. Of this, 2 per cent,
may have gone into the interiors of
locally-bred ’hoppers; the balance was
eaten by visitors from north of the
Lachlan. For two days they were like a
heavy snowstorm going south. Then they
gradually eased off for 10 days, after
which only a few million shock troops
stayed behind to clean up.
Luckily for us the wheat was fairly
ripe. The local expert says we can thank
pastoralists who neglected to lay poison
when the swarms were young. I would
like to see him trying to lay poison effec-
tively on a half-million-acre property. It
can be done on small holdings with plenty
of labor and poison—and money—but
they would have to remobilise the A.I.F.
to handle some of the larger areas. The
Government will have to think up some-
thing new.
FLOODGATES.
“Albarmount”; The floodgate of rails
suspended from a stout cable, mentioned
by “Marsh” (B. 10/12/’34), went out of
fashion years ago. Each type has its
special virtues, but, after 20 years’ ex-
perimenting with 50 miles of fencing over
mountain country, I plank for the strips
of netting hung with selvedges down-
wards from a solid cable well above high-
water mark. The bottom of each strip
is weighted down with rocks. One would
expect snags to catch in the netting, but
this rarely occurs.
If unable to get five cable above
high-water mark run it along the ground
and securely fasten the netting, which
in this case must be run straight along
as on a fence. The top selvedge is then
hooked to a wire so fixed that it will
pull out with the pressure of flood-
water. The bigger the flood the better is
this type of floodgate.
“W.G.8.”; Tell “Marsh” (B. 19/12/’34)
that in Queensland where floods are
high we put the cable or twisted wire
from tree to tree above flood level, put
pegs in trees on the top side, and into one
or more forked poles, according to
length, on the lower side. The forked
poles are tied to the cable and keyed
tight to prevent slipping. The heavy ends
of the rails swing from the cable. After
a flood the forked poles are lifted into
their proper places and the rails are put
back on to the pegs,
“Whalebone”: Try this for a flood-
gate on a rabbit-proof fence across small
creeks: At a suitable height stretch a
wire cable between heavy posts sunk on
each bank ; fasten lengths of netting side
by side along the cable, being careful to
leave about 2ft, spare on the creekbed.
Tie the sides of the netting securely to-
gether with tie-wire, and place slopes
on the bottom of the netting. When
washed out, it is only necessary to re-
place the netting and put the stones
on it again.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Tockilly”: If wedges will not enter
a log, rub dirt on the blade edge of the
wedge and in the imprint made by it on
the log, following the grain as nearly as
possible.
“Wrash”: Burning a broken handle
from the eye of an axe ruins the blade’s
temper. Saw the handle off flush. Place
the eye across a mortise and, with a bolt
or hardwood plug held against it, ham-
mer out the wedged portion. If it proves
stubborn bore two or three holes
through the wedge with a bit or soak
the axe in oil.
“Dai R.”: The clearing of rabbits
with plough or shovel and dogs may be
made more thorough if a burrow to
every quarter-mile square is left intact
till the whole area has been treated.
Bunnies that escape the dogs will seek
refuge in these, and fumigation will get
the lot.
“Valerin”: Prevention is always better
than cure for sore shoulders. Use well-
fitting collars, keep them clean and keep
the horses in good working condition. A
simple cure is 1 drachm of zinc acetate
in a pint of water. Apply daily with a
bit of cotton-wool.
“Agri”: The tin screw-top on a water-
bag will serve as an emergency eye-bath.
“Ekib”: To rid horses of lice wash the
animals with a 2 per cent, solution of
cylin and water, dry thoroughly and apply
to the affected parts dressings of one part
of kerosene, one part of oil of tar and 10
parts fish oil. The washing and dressing
should be done in the open, away from
stables and yard. Burn all litter, bed-
ding, etc., and disinfect premises and
harness. Repeat the dressing in a week’s
time.
“Wilga”: I can assure “Pick” (B.
5 /12/’34) that “Catchpenny” is right in
thinking that wire fences lead lightning
to animals. About 30 years ago a team-
ster near Trundle (N.S.W.) turned his
horses into a small paddock for the night.
In the morning he found seven dead.
The animals had been driven by a thun-
derstorm into the corner of the paddock
and thrust their heads under the upper
wire of the fence.

After the seventh, we switched over to

“Seen too much of it!” exclaimed the

MARIA’S UNFORTUNATE EYES.
Maria’s eyes are most unlucky ; there’s
always something getting into them. If
there happens to be a bit of cigarette-
ash floating about in the air looking for
someone to annoy, it will rush round a
corner or climb to the seventh floor of
a building in order to get into Maria’s eye.
Because of this, I suggested that she
should travel in a non-smoking com-
partment of a train; but when we
alighted I found her using her handker-
chief to her eye. She said some ash
from the cigarette I was smoking in the
front compartment had swept round,
forced its way through the closed door
and done the usual damage.
Things in shops have a way of catch-
ing her eye. She’ll say: “I saw the din-
kiest little hat to-day at the Stores. It
caught my eye.” The remark always
reminds me of barbed-wire. It must
be very painful; I know it is to me.
They are a poor sort of eyes, anyway,
for Maria can’t see a joke. At least she
can’t see my jokes ; and she can’t see
why—the “why” covering a hundred
things about myself. And they were the
cause of all my trouble.
You see, Maria is careless. She let
her eyes fall on me; then she cast
them to the ground, which is no
way to treat eyes. Being a perfect
little gentleman I returned her stare;
and after that her optical acrobatics
fascinated me. She would at times throw
her eyes to the ceiling or into the future,
or even over the horizon, drop them to
the floor, let them fall all over the place
and cast them in my direction, until I
found myself married to her.
Yes, her eyes are most unfortunate —
for me. jj m

At home, too, he invariably kept his
possessions in their allotted places, and
even his wife declared that he was per-
fect in that respect. Never did he mis-
place even a collar stud.
One day he fell sick —so sick that he
felt sure that he was going to die. Seized
by a terrible fear, he caught a taxi to
the nearest cemetery, staggered into it
and sank down among the tombstones.
Then, with a look of ineffable content,
he gave up the ghost.

PEEPS AT THE PROFESSIONS.
XVII. —THE DENTIST.
When the villains of old put a man on
the wheel
And broke him, a bone at a time.
Or put out his eyes with hot splinters
of steel
And filled up the sockets with lime,
Their methods were crude; and yet
underneath
They were much like the present-day
puller of teeth,
With just one slight difference —one can’t
avoid it —
They didn’t deny that they really en-
joyed it.
We have all met that horrible species
of small boy that delights in catching
flies and pulling their wings off. If they
had their deserts these little wretches
(the boys, not the flies) would be smoth-
ered, gently but firmly, and, of course,
as unobtrusively as possible.
As it is, they grow up and become
dentists.
Retaining all the fiendish cruelty that
inspired the wing-pulling, they have
learned to cloak it with an air of ben-
evolence and bonhomie which, if any-
thing, makes their adult activities even
more reprehensible than their infantile
atrocities.
In the olden days an offending tooth
was “pulled out” by the doctor or barber
—both very human fellows, who felt
honestly sorry for the pain they knew
they were inflicting. More than that,
so genuine was their sympathy that it
can truly be said that they hurt them-
selves more than their clients.
Nowadays all dentistry is painless.
That is to say, the dentist doesn’t feel
the slightest twinge, and he keeps insist-
ing that you can’t feel it either. He jabs
a needle into your gum, somewhere near
the tooth, but no nearer than he can
help.
“That doesn’t hurt, does it?” he gloats.
If you are wise you say it doesn’t,
even though it is ten times more painful
than the toothache. He seems a bit dis-
appointed.
“Good! It must be completely anaes-
thetised by now. We’ll just make sure.”
This entails jabbing a large spike into
the gum and prodding vigorously.
“Can you feel that?” His tone is
menacing.
“No,” you lie.
“Right! Now we’ll have it out in a
jiffy.”
It is the longest jiffy you’ve ever ex-
perienced, and it is crammed full of
excruciating agony. You realise that the
roots of the tooth, instead of ending, as
you thought, somewhere behind the left
ear, reach right down to your boots, and
they fight every inch of the way. Your
eyes are shut, but you can feel the
dentist’s hot breath on you as he tugs
and twists the tongs in your mouth.
The world breaks in twain. You realise
that the tooth is out, and that the pain
is worse than ever. This thought is
mingled with a wild hope that the sudden
surrender of the tooth may have caused
him to overbalance and break his neck.
The hope is vain. He stands there
leering triumphantly.
“There you are. Didn’t hurt a bit,
did it?”
Your mouth feels very like the earth
must have felt when the moon was torn
away from it, but you manage to grin
feebly and mumble what is meant to be
“No.”
He is examining the spoils.
“By Jove! I think I’ve got the wrong
one. Let me look again.”
At this stage you must be very firm.
If you allow him to look he won’t rest
until he has extracted every tooth in
your head, and your case will bring forth
roars of laughter at the next Dental Con-
gress.
Throw the nurse at him and hasten
away.

Information Sought.
(1) Where and when was Larry Foley born,
and where and when did he die ? (2) From
whom did Foley win the Australian heavyweight
championship ? (3) Who beat him for this title ?
(4) How many fights are there in his record ?
—5052.
(1) Born at Sofala, near Bathurst, N.S.W.,
on December 24, 1847; died, of heart disease,
at St. Vincent’s Hospital, Sydney, N.S.W., on
July 12, 1917. (2) After scoring a 16-round
knockout over Abe Hicken in 1879 and fighting
a 40-round draw with Prof. Miller in 1883,
Foley became recognised as holder of the title.
(3) He was not beaten. His last and only
fight in defence of the title was an eight-round
draw with Jack Burke in 1888. (4) Twenty-
seven, of which 22 were wins, four were draws
and one was a no-decision.
(1) Were tanks used in the Great War by
the Allies as well as the British ? (2) If so,
were they of independent design ? (3) Did the
Germans use tanks ? —5027.
(1) Yes, by the French and by the American
Expeditionary Force. (2) French experts were
working on a light tank founded on the Holt
tractor when they were apprised of the exist-
ence of the first British tanks in 1916. The
French persisted with their own ideas, and
evolved three types of tanks, two medium and
one light, with greater mobility but all lighter
than the British model. The Schneider tank
was six metres long, had a 60-h.p. engine
and was armed with one short 75mm. gun and
two machine-guns. The St. Chamond was
slightly heavier, being eight metres in length,
with a 80-h.p. engine, and carried one 75mm.
gun and four machine-guns. On account of
their shorter bases and type of drive they lacked
the climbing power of the bigger British tanks.
The light Renault tank, weighing only 6£ tons,
was in greatest use by the end of the war.
It was four metres in length, had a 35-h.p.
engine, and was of two types—one armed with
a 37mm. gun, the other with one machine-gun;
each tank had a crew of two—driver and
gunner. The Americans built a huge factory
in France to turn out Liberty tanks, but none
had been completed by the Armistice. The
A.E.F. used heavy British tanks and light
Renaults. (3) Germany constructed a few
heavy tanks, which were clumsy and generally
unsuccessful. These were used in conjunction
with captured Allied tanks, but this was eventu-
ally abandoned for anti-tank measures.
What measures were used by Germany
against British military tanks ? —4996.
A defence system of pits and wide ditches
was tried, but abandoned as inadequate and
over-costly. Heavy rifles firing an armor-
piercing bullet were adopted with some success.
These, however, proved ineffective against the
later, more heavily-armored tanks. A system
of defence zones of land mines was insti-
tuted, but proved too erratic. Light field-guns
in forward emplacements were the most suc-
cessful measure employed—especially at Cam-
brai.
(1) What proportion of Suez Canal shares is
held by Britain and France respectively ? (2)
What dividends are paid ? —4734.
(1) The British Government holds 44 p.c. of
the shares, and 10 of the 32 administrators are
British, No information available as to French
shareholders. (2) The company pays 5 p.c.
interest (in gold francs) on the unredeemed
original shares, and provides a sinking fund
of .04 p.c. to redeem such shares by the expiry
of the concession, a sum not exceeding 5 p.c. of
the balance is added to the statutory reserve,
and of the remainder 15 p.c. belongs to the
Egyptian Government, 10 p.c. to the founder’s
shareholders, 2 p.c. to the administrators, 2 p.c.
to the employees and 71 p.c. to the holders of
the original shares (whether redeemed or not).
In 1880, the Egyptian Government sold its rights
(15 p.c. of surplus profits) to the Credit Fon-
der, of France, transferred by it to the Suez
Canal Egyptian Government Interest Trust.
Was the Empire broadcast at Christmas a
genuine broadcast of speakers in Australia or a
reproduction of conversations, effects, etc., pre-
viously prepared ? —4964.
The broadcast emanated from the studios of
the 8.8. C., which intimated that it wanted
items illustrative of little-known phases of
Australian life. In order to convey this atmo-
sphere it was necessary to obtain the effects in
advance, as the hour of the broadcast was un-
suitable to Australia. The British organisation
chose items submitted by the A.8.C., and it
was made clear that the broadcast was a re-
corded one.
What is the , length of each of the three
longest rivers in the world; (1) their names; (2)
salt or fresh; (3) width at mouth; and (4), if
fresh, how far at sea can fresh water be
obtained beyond their mouths in normal river
heights ?— 4981.
(1) Amazon, between 3000 and 4000 miles;
Nile, 3400 miles from Victoria Nyanza; Mis-
sissippi, 2960 miles; (2) all rivers, as distinct
from arms of the sea, are fresh; (3) the main
channel of the Amazon is 50 miles wide at the
mouth, exclusive of the Para mouth and the
island of Joannes; the Nile and the Mississippi
embouch into vast deltas; (4) depends on many
factors impossible to detail here.
(1) When did the system of awarding medals
to the British Army originate ? (2) Are British
medals inscribed with the name of recipient ?
5039.
(1) The earliest known award of a medal
for war services dates back to the Crusades,
about 1480. The first mass issue was made by
Queen Elizabeth to celebrate the victory over
the Spanish Armada (1588). These and the
war-service medals of the Peninsular Campaign
were granted to officers only. The East India
Cos. inaugurated the practice of awarding
medals to all ranks, and this was carried on by
Britain when the affairs of the co. were taken
over. The first medal for general issue was
for service at Waterloo. The original idea of
presenting a medal for each engagement was
found to be too cumbersome, and was aban-
doned for one medal to commemorate the
entire campaign, with the addition of clasps
for individual battles. ((2) Yes. All modern
British medals bear the name, rank and, in
some cases, the unit of recipient. This will be
found on the edge of round medals and on the
back of crosses or star-shaped medals. This
does not apply to miniatures, which are not an
army issue.
(1) Are there any regulations prohibiting ex-
soldiers from wearing service medals or ribbons
with mufti ? (2) What are the regulations re-
garding the wearing of miniature medals ? May
they be worn on Anzac Day? —soo9.
(1) Service medals and decorations or medal
ribbons must not be worn with mufti or other
than military or Government service uniforms
(such as the police force) except on Anzac Day
(April 25) and Armistice Day (November 11).
(2) Miniature medals may be worn only with
mess uniforms or with full evening dress (not
dinner suits or frock coats), and then only at
functions where royalty or Vice-royalty is
present, or at military functions where special
permission to wear miniature medals has been
granted.
(1) Expenditure of Defence Department in
last financial year ? (2) Annual cost of League
of Nations to Australia? (3) Cost of Mr.
Latham’s goodwill mission ? (4) Where are
such figures obtainable ? —4554.
(1) £3,442,576. (2) £52,000. (3) £4334. (4)
In the Commonwealth Estimates relative to the
financial year in which the expenses were in-
curred, available for perusal at most public
libraries.
(1) Are there any existing manuscripts of
the plays of Shakspeare ? (2) Or any other
authentic manuscripts by him ? —5015.
(1) No. (2) Only a few signatures to legal
documents.
Did Balzac write any plays ? —5057.
Yes, five—“Vautrin,” “Les Ressources de
Quinola,” “Pamela Giraud,” “La Maratre” and
“Mercadet,” all translated into English, in
George Saintsbury’s edition.
Best motor route between Nyngan and Armi-
dale (N.S.W.), with mileage and information as
to conditions of roads ?— 5021.
Nyngan to Dubbo 113 miles, Cobborah 163,
Dunedoo 174, Coolah 204, Tambar Springs 242,
Mullaley 262, Gunnedah 287, Tamworth 338,
Bendemeer 363, Uralla 393 and Armidale 407
miles. Road conditions generally are fair to
good, and the road throughout is available in
all weathers.
(1) Are there schools in England for training
commercial air pilots ? (2) Age limit for pupils
entering such schools ? (3) Cost and duration
of course ? —4842.
(1) Yes. English trade journals regularly
contain advertisements inserted by various
organisations engaged in flying training activi-
ties. (2) Commercial pilots’ licenses are issued
only to persons over 19 and under 45, but pupils
are permitted to commence training before
reaching the minimum age, and are eligible to
hold private licenses at the age of 17 years. (3)
The duration of the course depends on aptitude
of pupil, but before a license is issued a pilot
is required, as one qualification, to have com-
pleted 100 hours’ solo flying. Asa basis for
computation, the total charges to commercial-
license standard in Australia average about
£2OO in the case of a pilot who has to hire
aircraft in order to complete the required
flying time.
Does saliva assist in digestion of food ? What
causes its flow when eating ordinary foods ?
5017.
Saliva has digestivd properties owing to the
presence of a ferment or enzyme which has the
power of acting upon starch. This ferment is
known as ptyalin or salivary diastase; in an
alkaline medium it converts starch products
into simpler bodies or dextrins. Salivary diges-
tion proceeds until the acid secretion of the
stomach has penetrated to the interior of the
food bolus. The flow of saliva is stimulated
either by the presence of food in the mouth
or by the thought, sight or smell of food. Con-
trolling influences pass from the brain to sali-
vary glands along the nerve fibres. Moist and
soft foods that can be swallowed without
mastication cause a minimum secretion of
saliva; this factor demands attention in food
regulation and diet.
What is calamine lotion; how prepared and
used for hives and skin eruptions ? —5029.
Formula is: Prepared calamine 2 drachms,
oxide of zinc 1 drachm, glycerine 1 drachm,
distilled water (or rosewater) to 3oz. For heat
spots and hives combine the lotion with equal
parts of liquid witch-hazel; dab over irritable
skin twice or thrice daily. Calamine lotion is
also used in simple eczema, especially where
the surface cuticle is inflamed and tender, and
to conceal pimples and acne blemishes. The
liquid may be applied under ordinary face
powder as a base.
What is myocarditis ? Symptoms and treat-
ment ? —5004.
Muscular inflammation of the heart. The
condition is characterised by a gradual enlarge-
ment of the cardiac tissue, with some indura-
tion or hardening of the heart substance.
Shortness of breath with slight exertion is
noted; also local pain, giddiness and disordered
circulation. There is usually an inherited pre-
disposition to these fibroid changes in the
heart muscle, but cases differ widely in both
origin and symptoms. Treatment differs accord-
ing to circumstances.
(1) Difference between pressure type and suc-
tion type of gas producer ? (2) By what
process is the gas produced ? —4930.
(1) The pressure type pumps the gas into a
tank or into a gasometer. The gas is then
supplied to any regular type of gas engine as
a fuel. With the suction type, gas is generated
in the gas producer. It passes through a washer
and is then drawn into the cylinder of the
engine by the suction of the piston. (2) Pro-
cess consists of passing air, or a mixture of
air and steam, through a bed of burning coal,
coke, charcoal or wood.
What is cloisonne ware and where is it
made ? —4925.
It is a kind of decorated enamel ware. The
design is first drawn on metal and worked in
gold, silver or copper wire secured to the metal
with a special gum. The whole is then clayed
over so that the wire is flush with the surface
and the design is colored, after which it is
burnt and painted in turn, three times. The
surface is finally smoothed with a stone, or the
whole may be melted into glass (vitrified) in
a furnace. Cloisonne ware is made both in
China and Japan, the articles taking the form
of vases, bowls and small ornaments.
I have taken a number of landscape photo-
graphs containing clouds, but these do not
appear on the negative. How can I remedy
this ? —5007.
Use color-sensitive films, such as Kodak
Verichrome or Agfa, together with a yellow
filter. Clouds are most easily photographed
when immediately in front of the sun. Giving
more light to the sky portion when printing will
give a juster value to the clouds.
(1) Is the ferro-prussiate printing process a
difficult one ? (2) Materials required ? (3)
Materials required for etching ? (4) Name of
a book on etching and blue-printing? —5013.
(1) No. (2) Sensitised paper, printing frame
and developing dish. The printing is done by
exposing to the-sun, the exposed print being
developed in water. Paper is obtainable in
20yd. rolls, wide, price 13/6, from
Harding and Halden Sensitising Cos., 9 Barrack-
street, Sydney. Instructions are sent on re-
quest. (3) A metal plate; a ground consisting
of five parts wax and three parts gum-mastic, by
weight; a point for cutting through the ground
such as a gramophone needle suitably mounted;
a mordant such as nitric or nitrous acid mixed
with an equal quantity of water; ink, paper and
press, the last being the only expensive item.
(4) “Printing of Etchings and Engravings,” by
D. Strang, 18s. 6d., Dymock’s, Sydney.
(1) How to soften brass and copper ? (2)
How to harden copper ? —SOOO.
(1) The parts to be softened should be heated
in a flame or oven of even temperature to a
temperature equivalent to a dull-red color, and
then they should immediately be plunged into
cold water. Avoid overheating the metal, for
if it is heated to a full-red color it will dis-
integrate. (2) Copper is hardened by hammer-
ing, rolling or extruding through steel dies.
How to prevent silver from tarnishing in
rooms containing gas and coke fires ? —5024.
Dissolve gelatine in hot water until a syrup-
like consistency is obtained. Add sufficient
potassium bichromate to give the solution a
light lemon color. The solution should be
applied to the surface of the silver warm,
using a camel-hair brush for the purpose so
as to give a thin uniform coating.
How to make waterproof lipstick ? —4909.
Mix together over gentle heat paraffin wax
80 parts, vaseline 80 parts, or less in hot
weather, anchusine one-half part, bergamot oil
one part. Carmine may be used for coloring
instead of anchusine. To waterproof, add a
very small quantity of gum arabic dissolved in
water.
How to preserve a home-made flour paste ?
--5014.
Add to the boiling water before combining it
with the flour half-teaspoon powdered alum;
when the paste is cooked, but while still hot
from the fire, stir in half-teaspoon of essence
of cloves; these quantities for half a pint of
paste. Keep the paste covered well after it has
cooled in its container.
(1) What are the arms of Kingston-upon-
Hull ? (2) The blazer and badge worn by the
Yorkshire County Cricket Club ? —4945.
(1) On a ground azure, three ducal coronets
in pale or (gold). (2) Badge, the white rose of
York; blazer, dark blue, with the white rose
badge on pocket. The badge is worn also on
the cap.
Name of a good book on theatrical make-up ?
—5060.
The art of make-up cannot be learned from
any book. Take a few lessons from an ex-
perienced actor.

TALES THE TYRES TELL.
WHERE TO LOOK FOR TROUBLES AFTER THE HOLIDAY TOUR.
By FRED BERRY.
PARING the holiday season almost every car has been
•L-' working overtime, and in many instances has covered
mileage equivalent to three months* normal touring.
As a result of this strenuous going, numerous faults will
have developed, perhaps insignificant in themselves, but in-
volving a major overhaul or expensive replacement if left for
any considerable timfc. Now is the time to lake the stitch that
saves nine.
First it would be advisable to make a
careful inspection of tyres and brakes, for
fast travelling over strange country roads
involves frequent and sometimes violent
brake application, with corresponding
wear of tyres.
Furthermore,
where great dis-
tances have been
covered in a short
period the motor-
ist who is keen
enough to read
the signs will find
evidence on the
tyre treads of in-
correct inflation,
steering faults or
misalignment of
road wheels. Be
the car new or
old, the driver
who at the con-
clusion of a long,
fast tour finds all
tyres evenly worn
can consider him-
self indeed for-
tunate.
Incorrect
Inflation.
In these days
of “free air” it is
gross carelessness
on the part of
any motorist to
drive with under-
inflated tyres, and
yet a few minutes
in any car park
will reveal any number of instances
where the centre portion of the
tread is comparatively new while the
shoulders on either side show defi-
nite wear. Reason, of course, is that
at unduly low pressures the centre section
of the tread sinks into the tyrd, leaving
the shoulders to take the load. In addi-
tion, under-inflation results in undue
Damaged beyond repair because
it has been run flat. The same
thing will happen if run under-
inflated for long periods.

stress being imposed on the walls of
casings, due to the acute angle of flexing,
and as a consequence cords are loosened
in the fabric, side walls begin to crack,
and, in the event of a violent skid, the
tyre may possibly burst.
Over-inflation can be detected by rapid
wear of tread centre, but few motorists
offend in this direction, for the very good
reason that under these conditions riding
is harsh and there is an alarming increase

pressures and even road contact. Fig. 2. — Under- inflation, with rapid wear of outside thirds of tread.

in squeaks and rattles both of bodywork
and suspension.
Faulty Alignment.
Misalignment of road wheels will, of
course, play havoc with tyres, and the
troubles can be caused by faulty align-
ment of the front wheels or by reason of
shock bending either axle or wheel hous-
ing. Each car is designed with a definite
toe-in and camber of the front wheels,
and in cases where new tyre equipment
shows uneven wear on one side of the
tread one should at the first oppor-
tunity have these measurements carefully
checked.
Play in steering connections due to
wear is frequently responsible for exces-
sive toe-in of front wheels, and as a con-
sequence, instead of the tyre rolling freely
round its centre, a scrubbing motion is
imparted to the tread as it makes contact
with the road. Evidence of this fault can
be gathered by inspecting the tyre after
a long trip, for the tread, instead of wear-
ing in a level fashion, appears to have
been “sandpapered” diagonally, and the
rubber, instead of being smooth, will
have a “furry” appearance. Correction
of this error is an inexpensive business,
involving, perhaps, half an hour’s work,
yet to continue running in this fashion
may quite conceivably double tyre costs.
In order to provide light steering at
speed and give a self-centring action
after taking a corner the front wheels
of all modern cars are given a definite
camber, i.e., the tyres are wider apart
at the top than at road level. Shocks
due to bumping kerbs or driving fast over
rough roads may easily upset this critical
adjustment, and excess wear of one side
or other of the tread, coupled with a
“feather edge,” is a certain indication of
incorrect camber.
Steering Faults.
The defect can be speedily rectified by
any modern service station, expenditure
will be saved in the next thousand miles,
and, what is equally important, defects
in steering will be eliminated.
Excessive tyre wear on rear wheels is
in rather a different category, for here
the trouble is generally due to a bent
driving axle. This means that, in-
stead of the tyre revolving in a fixed
plane, it wobbles from side to side,
with the result that certain sections of
the tyre tread absorb both side and
driving thrust, with attendant excessive
wear. Under these conditions of opera-
tion the effective life of a tyre may easily
be halved, and, furthermore, driving on
wet or greasy roads is fraught with con-
siderable risk. Obviously this serious
defect must be rectified at the earliest
opportunity, and the only certain remedy
is to fit a new axle and check the align-
ment of the transmission mechanism.
Just one other point in regard to tyre
economy. Every motorist, of course, de-
sires the greatest mileage possible, but no
tyre should be left on a wheel after the
breaker strip shows through, for from
this moment risk of complete loss is in-
curred. Immediately the “canvas” shows
through the tread it is a good policy to
remove the casing and, if it is free from
cuts and faults, take it to some reputable
firm and have it retreaded.
New Tyres or Retreads.
Unfortunately, in a misdirected effort
to secure greater economy, many drivers
attempt a second retread on the original
casing, but this plan is almost certain to
bring in its train a deal of worry and
bother, and a new tyre is a sounder in-
vestment in the circumstances.
Having now checked tyres, it will be
found that during the holiday tour the
car has been subjected to fairly rough
usage, and as a consequence dents in
guards and bodywork have made an
appearance. These blemishes may not be
very noticeable, and they do not seriously
affect efficiency; but, left for some months,
rust, the great enemy of metalwork, will
take its toll, and the ensuing repair bill
may come as a shock. It is a far better
plan to have these simple jobs attended
to immediately, for, attended to at once,
the outlay will be small and the car will
be “as new” again.
Damage to upholstery must be treated
similarly, for a small tear, repaired at
once, is but a
petty item, but let
it go for any time
and the whole
seat squab will
need replac-
ing if a present-
able and service-
able repair is
required.
Jobs to Do.
There are, of
course, a host of
jobs that could at
this time be at-
tended to if one
earnestly desires
a trouble - free
season, and one
of the first will
be to carefully
inspect all wheels,
for, although wire
and steel wheels
are, in later
models, standard
equipment, there
are a huge num-
ber of cars still
fitted with
wooden - spoked
artillery wheels.
Every day we
hear cars pass
along the highways with the spokes
of wooden wheels squeaking. Motor-
ists should realise that continuing in
this fashion is a costly process. Taken
in the early stages of looseness, spokes
of wooden wheels can be wedged at very
little cost, and so restored to full effici-
ency, but left for any great period the
wheel must be wholly rebuilt to make an
effective and satisfactory repair. Mean-
while there will be a distinct risk of

heat the cells, with consequent loss of
electrolyte. Always keep the level of
the fluid at least one quarter inch above
the plates ; otherwise the battery cannot
perform at full efficiency. In many cases
where the car is about two years old the
battery will lose its charge and fail to
start the motor if left standing more than
a few days. This is a sure indication of
senile decay. A new battery is the only
certain remedy.
What we propose to do to the engine
must now be carefully considered, for
upon its efficiency and reliability depend,
to a very great extent, our out-of-pocket
expenses for the ensuing year. Assum-
ing the car has passed the 25,000-mile
mark, certain renewals are essential.
First, fit a new set of plugs and keep the
old ones as spares. Maybe these old
warriors are apparently giving good ser-
vice, but the new set will save its initial
cost in a few months by improving fuel
consumption, increasing power and less-
ening risk of ignition failure.
Ignition Troubles.
While on this job, check over the
make-and-break points in the distributor.
Almost certainly they will be worn to the
metal, so get a new pair and slip them
into place. Take the clip from the
generator and starter motor and clean
grit and carbon from the commutator.
See that the brushes are not unduly worn.
All should then be well with the elec-
trical system.
With regard to the reciprocating parts
of the engine, it is a difficult matter to
assess exactly what work should be done.
Much will depend upon whether the
motorist has always used good oil and
spirit, and whether the car is equipped
with an oil-cleaner and air-filter. Pos-
sibly under these happy conditions it will
merely be necessary to fit a new set of
rings, clean the combustion chamber of
carbon, and grind and adjust the valves
in order to restore the engine to its
original efficiency. At worst a few shims
may have to be taken from the crank-
shaft and big-end bearings.
On the other hand, should the motor
be ill-used and badly serviced, cylinder
wear may be so great that the only
remedy will be reboring, with fitting of
new pistons and rings, or, alternatively,
having liners fitted, retaining the original
pistons. Reboring has been the usual
practice in the past, but advice in this
respect is to carefully examine the pos-
sibility of fitting liners. There is distinct
merit in this plan provided it is under-
taken by skilled hands.
Points About Lubrication.
To be sure of pure, clean oil passing
through the bearings a new cartridge
should now be fitted to the oil purifier,
and the air-cleaner could, with advantage,
be dismantled and thoroughly washed in
petrol before refitting. Remove the glass
bowl from base of mechanical fuel pump
and wash it free from grit and foreign
matter, and see that the cork packing is
in good condition and makes a perfectly
airtight fit.
One other point worth checking up is
in connection with hollow crankshafts.
This passage is intended to convey oil at
pressure to each of the connecting-rod
ends and main bearings, but after long
service there is always a possibility of a
spongy deposit forming, so restricting the
free flow of oil. Should the sump be
dropped for crankcase inspection it
would therefore be advisable to have
these oilways carefully cleaned.
At the same time dismantle all the
copper pipe both in the petrol and lubri-
cating systems, clean thoroughly and
then heat to redness over a gas-fire and
plunge into cold water. This annealing
process will remove ail possibility of frac-
ture due to vibration, and will restore the
tubes to their original “new” condition.
As a final warning, motorists should
be advised against any cheeseparing
policy in the annual overhaul. A few
shillings extra on any particular job may
mean the difference between success or
failure. Furthermore, it will almost cer-
tainly effect a greater saving than the
initial outlay.
Motor Oddities.
“Jo”: Motorists are tickled to death
at a speed test carried out recently by
the Vic. Railway Dept, with a big A 2
express engine in an effort to cut down
the time between Bendigo and Mel-
bourne, a distance of 101 miles, and the
defeat of the train by a Baby Austin
racing along the main road. The way
was prepared for the train to have a
clear run, but the baby car beat it’s time
by 20} minutes, though it had to observe
traffic regulations.

“G.M.”: Ran across an acquaintance
—let’s call him Smith —and, asking him
where he lived, was directed to his car.
When I looked puzzled. Smith explained.
The depression had hit him hard, but
had left him with an old battered saloon
car. Smith and his missus now utilised
the car as a home, driving it each night
to some suburban vacant allotment and
sleeping there. Sometimes when they
had to be in early, they would lodge it
in an official parking place. “Even if
we had to do that every night,” ex-
plained Smith, “our rent would only be
seven shillings a week.” With a suit-
case in the car, changes in his office and
meals at cheap restaurants, Smith and
Mrs. Smith were able to maintain at
least an appearance of comfort.

“Jo”: Loaded with wool from Tambo
station (W.Q.) Herb Turnbull and Short
had a thrilling ride into Charleville. Driv-
ing along they believed they were going
to run into a big duststorm, but got the
shock of their lives to find clouds of
grasshoppers. Millions of them took pos-
session of the lorry, coming on to the
driving seat in a solid mass. With diffi-
culty the drivers stopped the engine and
got under for protection. After the main
body had passed, they discovered that
the ’hoppers had sailed off with a green
sweater.

jerky progress entails using bottom gear until
the motor is hot. Cause and cure ?
Provided gasket manifolds are intact, you will
almost certainly find the trouble due to a
cracked cylinder-head gasket. This will allow
water to foul the plugs, the trouble disappearing
when sufficient heat is conducted from adjacent
cylinders.
E.B. (Wagga, N.S.W.). —Since overhaul of
my 501 Fiat, the motor seems lifeless. Starts
easily, but stalls unless revved up before engag-
ing top gear. Car is sluggish on hills, and
overheats readily. Cause and cure ?
Check valve tappet adjustment. If valves
are riding the motor will not give full power
output. Leaks in inlet manifold gaskets may be
responsible, but should both these matters be
in order there probably has been a mistake
in assembing the timing gear. If uncertain of
exact setting, write Willsford, Ltd., Phillip-
street, Sydney, for details.
K.C.T. (Yenda, N.S.W.). —Has a device for
making car headlights turn in conjunction with
steering gear been exploited ?
Yes, swivelling and dipping headlights are
fitted to many English and Continental cars.
Traffic regulations in N.S.W. prohibit the use
of such equipment.
J.B.C. (Wilcannia, N.S.W.).— Address of
agents for car illustrated B. 5/12/’34?
Garratt’s, Ltd., Elizabeth-street, Sydney.
T.L.L.D. (Williamstown, Vic.). —Excepting
the engine, what running parts of the 1918
Buick are duplicated in the 1920 model ?
Gearbox, rear-axle assembly and braking
system are interchangeable between 1918 and
1920 series.
D.B. (Quirindi, N.S.W.). —(1) Is the new De
Soto good value ? (2) In view of great de-
parture from previous specification of body,
etc., do you think a new model will appear this
year ? (3) Do you consider the suspension in
the current model as good as independent
springing of front wheels.
(1) Yes. (2) Extremely unlikely. (3) Where
engine position is well forward, as in Chrysler
and De Soto Airflow models, the practice
appears to be satisfactory.
T.S.B. (Mildura, Vic.).—(l) Why is the four-
speed gearbox retained in the transmission of
cars which incorporate the fluid flywheel ? (2)
Is there a method of giving the low-geared
Ford T truck a higher top gear while still
retaining the present two forward ratios ?
(1) Gearboxes are fitted to assist acceleration
and hill-climbing. Torque converters of various
types and modification of fluid flywheel design
are, however, steadily growing in favor as sub-
stitute for gearbox. (2) An auxiliary gearbox
can be fitted in the tailshaft forward of the
differential, but cost of alteration and installa-
tion is rather high for this type of truck.
W.F. (Austin’s Ferry, Tas.). —What are the
possibilities of converting one of several touring
cars (named) to truck work, load 20/300vt.,
and road speed 30 m.p.h. average ?
Possibly either of the higher-powered cars
would do the job, but almost certainly you
will have continuous repair and replacement
bills to foot when handling heavy loads at high
speed. Your work demands a robust truck
chassis and transmission for efficient operation.
D.J.T. (Parramatta, N.S.W.). —I am troubled
with a mysterious falling off in power in the
engine of my six-cylinder car (symptoms and
steps taken outlined). Any suggestions ?
Although valve clearances have been
checked it is quite possible one or more
may be causing trouble after a half-hour run.
This would explain the poor pick-up after
slowing down. Either that or the carburettor
is being slowly starved of fuel.
R.J.B. (Rockhampton, Q.). —On letting in the
clutch on my Chev. Six I have to be very care-
ful because of vibration, which shakes the whole
car. Clutch has been relined, new pilot bush
put in flywheel and front roller bearing of
gearbox tested for looseness without curing the
trouble. What’s wrong ?
Excessive wear in universal joints of tail-
shaft, also loose splines in driving axles, would
cause chattering when starting off from rest.
Have these inspected.
V.F.P. (Warburton, Vic.). —Correct valve
clearance and adjustment of contact breaker
and spark plugs for 509 Fiat ?
Inlets, six-thou.; exhausts, eight-thou., when
motor is hot; contact breaker, 12-thou.; plugs,
16-thou.
J.R. (Cairns, N.Q.). —1 have under considera
tion two methods of lubricating my tractor
(outlined), one involving a consumption of 4|
gal. each 60 hours’ working, and the other 2
gal. Which is the better ?
By draining off half a gallon every 10 hours
and replacing with fresh oil you make sure qf
a continuous clean supply, an essential in
tractor practice, particularly under dirty con-
ditions. By draining completely every 60 hours
you will be running during a large part of the
period with poor oil, which would not justify
the saving. Careful tractor operators seldom
run more than 40 hours without draining the
sump, particularly in cases where rings and
cylinders are worn, as crankcase dilution im-
pairs the lubricating qualities of oil very quickly.

AERIAL DESIGN AFFECTS PERFORMANCE.
By SON B. KNOCK.
Although the aerial-and-earth system is the least expensive part of the radio
installation, the importance of design and construction is often overlooked.
At the transmitting end, it is vital that the size, location and type used should
be the best so that signals sent out have their greatest effect. In a similar
manner, the aerial and earth at the receiving end must be such that it takes
the fullest advantage of the signal energy available.
The modern receiver with its increasing
sensitivity does not call for the same
elaborate aerial equipment as formerly ;
but, nevertheless, the average set-owner
and home-constructor will increase re-
ceiving range by installing and paying
particular attention to an efficient out-
door aerial. There is little exaggeration
in the statement that a good outdoor
aerial is as good or equivalent to an
extra stage of R.F. amplification.
Yet the outdoor aerial has dis-
advantages. By increasing the received
signal voltage it also increases the static
interference, atmospheric or man-made.
Thus there is a limit, but the object of
the aerial is to increase the signal-to-noise
ratio. There is also the question of selec-
tivity. Too large an aerial will materi-
ally reduce the selective properties of the
receiver, which is a serious matter in city
and suburban areas. Country listeners
are not affected to anything like the same
extent.
The overall length of the aerial from
tip to ground should never exceed 150 ft.,
with the horizontal part as high as
possible. The actual length is difficult to
Fig. 1. —The inverted L-type aerial, show-
ing its directional qualities and the
method of staying the lead-in, which is
brought in through the framework of the
window.
give, because the selectivity of the par-
ticular receiver governs this factor. Ex-
perience indicates that within a 50-mile
radius of a high-powered station the flat
top should be no longer than 75ft.; while
for listeners more remote than this 100 ft.
to 150 ft. can be used. The length in-
cludes the lead-in.
Effective height is important. This is
not always the actual height above
ground, because trees, buildings, etc., may
be near or even under the flat top, and
these materially affect the electrical
height, considerably reducing its effec-
tiveness. The higher the flat top the
greater the signal energy received.
Trees and buildings themselves form
aerials and absorb energy, thus detract-
ing from the aerial. Yet it is not bad
practice to use a tree for one end support,
provided the aerial proper commences
at least 25ft. away from the tree ; pre-
ferably 40ft. to 50ft.
With trees, support presents a problem.
It is better to have the aerial above the
tree, and to do this a pole has to be
lashed to the top limb. To overcome
swaying and breaking of the wire and
keep the aerial taut at all times a pulley
is attached to the pole. Through this runs
a rope, preferably of steel, attached to
the aerial, and at the loose end is fixed
a heavy weight. The weight moves up
and down with the swaying of the tree,
thus keeping the aerial at a fixed distance
from the ground and preventing any
fading due to a swaying aerial.
Bringing the lead-in to the set is some-
times a little difficult. The first point is
to have an insulated stay to take the
strain of the wire, and so remove any
possibility of damage to the building or
aerial in the event of extra strain. A
good scheme is to drill a hole in the
window-pane, through' which a tube is
placed with the wire coming through it.
Another idea is insulated tubing through
the woodwork or through a ventilator.
Fig. 2, — The T-type aerial, which is
practically non-directive.
The important point is that the whole
of the aerial and lead-in should be
thoroughly insulated, with no possibility
of leakage at any point.
It is best to make the aerial and lead-
in of one piece, and so avoid joints,
soldered or otherwise. Clean connections
throughout are most important, for wire
which has become tarnished may offer
many ohms resistance, and signal voltage
is measured in micro-volts.
Precaution should be taken in fixing
the position of the aerial against inter-
ference by induction. The aerial never
should be parallel to or near any other
wires, whether they are power lines, tele-
phone lines or neighboring aerials. If
any such wire is close at hand, place the
aerial at right-angles to it, or, if there are
several, to the nearest of them. Little
interference will be experienced if the
aerial is higher than surrounding wires.
The best and most easily constructed
aerial for reception is a single wire form-
ing the inverted-L type or the T type.
In the former the lead-in is from the end,
and in the latter from the centre.
The directional properties of the in-
verted-L type aerial help to overcome
interference or to increase signal
strength. Fig. 1 shows the direction the
aerial should point for maximum signal
strength. This can have an important
bearing in obtaining the best results.
The earth connection is equally as im-
portant as the aerial. The waterpipe is
very popular, although it is often used
Fig. 3. —An aerial with a counterpoise
directly under it.
carelessly, bad electrical contact being
the worst fault. Earth leads should be
as short as possible, having one continu-
ous run of wire insulated in a similar
manner to the aerial. If the waterpipe
is not used a metal plate to which the
wire is soldered should be buried in per-
manently damp ground. In localities
where the ground is always dry, or al-
ternately damp and dry, a counterpoise
will be more effective. The counter-
poise consists of several strands of wire
hung directly under the flat top and
thoroughly insulated in a similar manner
to the flat top.
To test the system for insulation con-
nect a dry cell in series with a pair of
headphones across the lead-in and earth.
If a loud click is heard when opening or
closing the circuit it will indicate that the
aerial is earthed, but if no click is heard
the system is well-insulated.
It is necessary to stress the fact that
require that a lightning arrestor be fitted,
The regulation states that the lead-in
wire shall enter the building through a
'non-combustible, non-absorptive, insulat-
ing bushing, so arranged that moisture
is prevented from entering, and that each
:lead-in wire shall be fitted with an arres-
Itor of approved pattern fixed outside the
building near the point where the wire
tenters the building.

CHRISTOPHER STONES AND BIMBOS.
The fame of Christopher Stone of the
8.8. C. has penetrated even to Australia,
though there are probably hundreds who
would recognise the name who have only
the haziest notion what it stands for. Nor
would reference to the official publica-
tions of the 8.8. C. do much to enlighten
them. That great corporation has bor-
rowed many of the older traditions of
English journalism, among them an affec-
tion for what may be called editorial
anonymity. You may wade through a
year’s 8.8. C, programmes and find never
a mention of Christopher Stone. But
every radio listener in Great Britain
knows him well, and public appetite for
information concerning this minor lion
is satisfied as well as may be by journals
of the chatty sort that live by puffing
broadcasting performers. Christopher
Stone (I believe the name is a nom de
mike ) announces sessions of gramophone
recordings. A recording of one of his
preludes to such a session was put over
the air from Sydney recently. It con-
sisted of a rather discursive series of
reminiscences and scraps of autobio-
graphy. The voice was pleasant, the
English good enough, the matter ex-
tremely commonplace. The only feature
of the chat that helped to explain the
phenomenal popularity of the speaker
was that he certainly did create or sug-
gest an atmosphere of intimacy. Evi-
dently Mr. Stone’s personality has pleased
the British public, and his observations,
which do not pretend or attempt to be
brilliant or clever, are a source of quiet
enjoyment to hundreds of thousands.
Mr. Stone’s tremendous success can
hardly be explained away on the score
that all the other 8.8. C. announcers are
so dull that he shines like a little candle
in a dark night, though most Australians,
with only one sample of his art to judge
by, might feel impelled to that conclu-
sion. What seems more likely is that in
the beginning of things the 8.8. C., which
uses gramophone sessions merely as a
sort of fill-up, was not very particular as
to how such fare was presented and gave
the announcer a freer leg than usual. It
doesn’t seem to have altered its set policy
by an eighth of an inch in consequence
of the vast success of allowing latitude,
but great corporations are like that. But
the phenomenon of Stone’s success is in-
structive, and the lesson of it should not
be lost on Australian broadcasting
authorities. It seems to prove that radio
listeners are hungering and thirsting after
the human and intimate touch in broad-
casting, and that they may find it in
places which broadcasting managers
would deem most unlikely.
The quality of announcing in Australia
is pretty high. Judging by some samples
heard from Broadcasting House at the
time of the air race and on other occa-
sions of Empire-wide interest the general
level of culture and intelligence among
announcers here is a bit higher than it is
in Britain. But we haven’t yet unearthed,
as Britain has done, the phenomenally
popular personality. The barrier in the
way seems to be inability to talk, as it
were, in carpet slippers. We are all
familiar with those gushing ladies who
tell fairy stories to the tiny tots in voices
so overcharged with sugar that it
wouldn’t surprise one to hear them say
at the finish, sotto voce, “And now, thank
the Lord, I’ve finished with you beastly
little brats!” And with those gentlemen
whose talks about literature or travel
are so obviously read from carefully com-
posed notes. In these cases, though the
matter may be, and very often is, excel-
lent, the manner does not appeal. We
do not like you Dr. Fell.
But there is one vastly popular per-
sonality on the N. S. Wales circuit (other
States may have their parallels) in the
quite artificial character known as Bimbo
of 2GB. Bimbo is a schoolboy, a mix-
ture of shrewdness and stupidity of a
sort that has been popular in every age
and every country —Till Eulenspiegel is
the prototype. His humor is largely kin-
dergartenish, but it gains effect by being
seemingly entirely impromptu, and by its
complete appropriateness to the character
presented. Bimbo is often a sort of
comic Greek chorus to an entire session;
pestering the announcer with persistent
questions regarding what he has for his
meals, or when the afternoon-tea will put
in an appearance. Or he begs to be
allowed to tell a story or sing a song,
registering increasing discontent at re-
peated and angry refusals. Whereat
there are chuckles and grins in ten thou-
sand households. If we can’t have the
Australian equivalent of a Christopher
Stone, let us have more Bimbos. They
enliven and render human what is always
in danger of becoming too mechanical
and routine-ridden a business.
SIMPLICITAS.
Amateur Chatter.
According to a letter from a Maori-
lander in the November “T. and R. Bulle-
tin” (England), the year’s contest now in
progress on the 28mc. band cannot pro-
duce anything very startling in the way
of international DX. Judging by careful
observation and comparison with pre-
vious years, not forgetting the influence
of sunspots, the 28mc. band may be ex-
pected to come to life, as in 1928-29, to-
ward the end of 1935 or beginning of
1936. In the meantime, however, a fair
amount of semi-local DX may be ex-
pected at spasmodic intervals. During
the last gasps of 1934 quite a few Aus-
tralians were active on this band, but
not the full complement of locals in
Sydney. VK2LZ was heard in telephonic
communication with VK3HK, the latter’s
signals being extremely strong at inter-
vals, and with excellent quality of speech
and music. VK3ML was worked on the
key from the writer’s station, 3ML using
crystal, and with a very strong signal. He
was using a reflector system directed
at Maoriland, and, as Sydney is on the
side of his beam, the projected signal must
indeed have been solid. VKSLB (South
Australia) was heard at intervals, and
the ever-active VK4BB was audible late
one afternoon in communication with
somebody and remarking that he had

WHILE YOU DRIVE
You will get real pleasure listening to every radio programme you desire
as you speed along in your car on country road or city highway.
In the past, perfect car radio reception has been impossible because of
the interference caused by the electrical equipment of the car itself. But
now, after two years of constant experiment. “Traveltone” engineers have
produced a car radio that is entirely free from all interference, either from
the car or from trams and trains operating in the vicinity.
“Traveltone” is all-electric, and takes its power from the electric system
solely, without the aid of troublesome “B” batteries. It is as powerful and
as mellow as the most expensive home radio, and its superheterodyne circuit
guarantees knife-like selectivity under all conditions. “Traveltone” is one
of radio’s greatest achievements, and it brings a new delight to car owner-
ship. Ask to hear Traveltone —its great range and glorious tone will
amaze you.

The 14mc. band
still lacks the life of
pr e vious seasons,
and late-night Euro-
pean contacts need
fighting for. Static
has prevailed on this
band, and on 7mc.
it has been continu-
ous and machine-
gun-like for three weeks. In the early
mornings the European DX has fallen off,
and it is better to go to the beach with the
break of dawn than to sit pushing a
futile key. Old-timer VKSBY is back on
7mc., and reports that VKSLF, after
many years, has again acquired an ama-
teur complex, and is keenly building a
station after renewing his license. Some
old-timers are like soldiers —they merely
fade away!
VK2NO.
Country Short-wave Explorations.
Conditions have been rather patchy,
with the No. 1 transmission from the
B.B.C. much weaker from both stations,
and in the early mornings conditions
have been poor on all bands.
From 9.30 p.m. DJB’s 19-metre trans-
mission has been at really fine strength,
but DJN has fallen away until after 11
p.m. From then on until closing DJN
is very strong. The interference from
3ME (referred to B. 26/12/’34) is on
DJN, not GSB.
The most consistent station lately has
been FYA after 10 p.m., and also FYA
in the 25m. band in the morning. Fine
programmes were on from PHI, DJN,
DJB, and, of course, the special B.B.C.
Christmas programme, but unfortunately
GSE was not used, and GSB (31.5) or
GSD (25.5) are not so good at present.
The King’s speech was word-perfect, but
the earlier speakers faded down badly at
times.
DJC in the 49-metre band has proved
a surprise this summer. Last year in the
early mornings it was very strong ; this,
year it is barely receivable. RFN in
the same band is no better. PCJ (19.7)
has been heard testing aerials as early as
10 p.m., and was at fine strength at that
hour. On the regular transmission he is
still very weak.
RNE was only fair on a recent Sunday.
This station has cut out the questions
and answers from the 9 p.m. transmis-
sion and transferred them to 1 a.m.,
which is inaudible here at present. 2RO
(30.7) has been fair copy only with
’phones on. Nothing has been heard of
the new station except at the old hours,
which are not suitable for Australia.
If previous years can be taken as a
guide, 2RO will be very fine next winter
round about 8 a.m.; the old station came
in well, and the new has much greater
power and efficiency.
The biggest surprise has been hearing
VK2LZ at full speaker strength in the
10-metre band about 5 p.m. with ’phone
of great quality ; not a sign of static or
noisy background. It is doubtful if
many all-wave receivers will be effective
at this high frequency, and tuning would
be very critical.
The 40-metre band has been quite im-
possible at night for static, and almost as
bad in daylight. Interference is very bad,
and this band is overcrowded.
VUB has not been heard lately, and
seems to be very erratic in operation.
FYA (25.6) is keeping up surprising
strength in the daytime considering it is
midsummer. The station can still be
heard at quite good strength around
3 p.m.
NIGHTOWL.
Latest in the Trade.
In the matter of midget variable con-
densers for short-wave purposes the name
Wetless has always been foremost on
the Australian radio market. This
pioneer co. has just augmented its range
of sturdily-built midget variables with
an entirely new production known as the
Type SW, as illustrated. The new design
embodies sound electrical and mechani-
cal principles, and the result is a com-
pletely noiseless and constant variable
capacity with a minimum of dielectric.
The main bearing is of generous propor-
tions, built into an |in. steel frame carry-
ing moulded bakelite insulating bars for
the stator, the rotor being provided with
a special conical spring contact. The
motion is smooth and positive, and the
total degree of rotation permits the use
of wide-angle tuning dials if desired. The
minimum capacity is sufficiently low for
use with the usual lOOdeg. dial. These
condensers are strongly recommended for
short-wave receivers, and are obtainable
from Wetless Electric Manufacturing
Co., 281 King-street, St. Peters, N.S.W.,
in 3-, 5-, 11-, 13-, 17- and 20-plate
sizes. '
Transmitter Technique.
When using a single-ended power am-
plifier with the plate tank tuned by a
split-stator condenser difficulty may be
experienced in neutralising a three-elec-
trode valve if the inter-electrode capacity
is very small. Valves of the Mullard
DO/40, SW/50 and SW/2 types need
only a very small neutralising capacity,
about 10 micro-microfarads. This applies
also to valves of the 852 type.
Casual Comment.
“Sinbad”: The block-type Morse gad-
get mentioned by “Bungalinga” (B.
26/12/’34) for use in small ships has
been considered suitable for vessels under
1600 tons, but not in the opinion
of the marine unions. This automatic
gadget is an excellent device under cer-
tain conditions, but those conditions are
not obtainable at sea. With a vessel
pitching or rolling heavily it would take
considerably more than five minutes
to find and fit the type-blocks, while the
ship’s officers, who apparently are to do
this work, would have to waste time that
should be used in endeavoring to keep
the vessel afloat. It is also quite likely
that the sinking vessel’s nearest ship sta-
tion would be similarly equipped, and so
could not receive any messages, so that
it would be quite possible during summer,
when static is bad, for a ship to founder
without being able to effect communica-
tion with either ship or shore stations,
although she might be only 15 or 20
miles distant from another vessel so fitted.
Another reason why this instrument has
been objected to is that there is no way
of knowing if the SOS has been received,
while an untrained operator wouldn’t
even know whether the message was be-
ing put on the air or not. The extra
cost mentioned by “Bundalinga” is
ridiculous, the wages for a qualified
operator for this class of ship being only
£3 3s. a week, which, added to the usual
providore allowance for keep of 16s. per
week, would surely constitute a record
for low percentage for insurance pre-
miums. The suggestion (B. 19/12/’34)
that short-wave sets be fitted overlooks
the fact that all ship stations, except H.M.
ships, and all the continuous-watch shore
stations keep their watch on 600 metres,
so that even with one of 1200 ama-
teurs on the job it would not be any
good.
[“Sinbad” assumes that the suggestion
was for short-wave apparatus exclusively.
There are, among amateurs, those who
can be classed as “professionals,” and
low-powered I.C.W. 600-metre apparatus
is no more costly or difficult to design
and use than modest short-wave gear. It
is not correct to infer that short-wave
channels are of no use for such work.
Most commercial coastal stations are
equipped for short-wave reception on
all communication channels, to say
nothing of the R.A.A.F. bases. One pos-
sibility is an Amateur Marine Emergency
Corps, organised among responsible and
suitable amateurs who could keep watch'
on allocated channels during bad weather.
Maoriland has a well-organised Amateur
Emergency Radio Corps ready to go into
action during earthquakes, and Australia
could make use of her amateurs in a
similar way for the purpose of marine
communication,— Ed.]

(1) No. A suitable transformer must be used.
A 2A5 type will be correct. If this cannot be
obtained from speaker manufacturers separately,
try K. H. Jones, 5 Gladstone-street, Bexley,

purpose. (4) No, it is a matter of convenience.
The transformer can be fitted to the receiver

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
It requires some pluck to support a
two-year-old at his first appearance in
public. Ned Moss is not lacking in that
commodity, and he landed some nice
wagers when his colt Saecula romped
home in the Nursery at Canterbury,
having backed him from tens to threes.
Bred in M.L., and bought for 500
guineas, this son of Posterity and Veil
is a half-brother to Veilmond, Prince
Pombal and Visage, and has the same
bold action as Veilmond. He beat Pussy-
foot (20 to 1) and the favorite, Sir
Walter, who is not nearly as good as
was thought. Saecula ran green in the
early stages, but came home like an old
stager.
The Manfred gelding Raleigh (4 to 1
and better) capped all previous perform-
ances when he downed a smart field in
the Flying Welter. The Doomben New-
market winner Wollun was favorite, but
beat only a few stragglers to the judge ;
he requires more room than Canterbury
affords. The Queensland colt Regular
Bachelor was the surprise. Having his
first race since a spell, he looked big and
burly, but nevertheless he led until a
few yards from the judge. In a great
finish Raleigh beat him by half a head,
with Canegrass —who had got a run
on the rails—half a neck away. Regular
Bachelor is now being discussed for the
Challenge Stakes.
Warwick Farm trainer Battye has been
patient with the Treclare gelding Tre-
mayne, who, going out at 6 to 4, won the
Canterbury Handicap from Lavington
and Wallace Mimi. The Black Cat
scampered to the front, and had a lead of
20 lengths passing the stand the first
time ; but he tired. Tremayne and Laving-
ton, suited by the solid pace, took charge
at the Leger, where the former shifted
out, but did not interfere with Laving-
ton. He won, running away, in time
equalling the course record for 11 fur-
longs. A protest was quickly dismissed.
Parcourir (5 to 4) annexed the Park
Stakes in a manner that suggested that
she will win over a bit of a distance.
Jim Pike on Assai made an effort to steal
the race on the turn, but Parcourir (a
nice-looking mare by Cistercian—Dupe,
trained at Moorefield) finished too
strongly, to win by half a length, Mill-
som being third.
After Money, Maoriland-owned and
-bred, was looked upon as a good thing
for the Campsie Handicap, starting at
10 to 9 after even money had been taken
for large amounts. Cynical was backed
from 7 to 2 to 9 to 4, and his trainer
demonstrated that it is a wise policy
to keep racing a horse while he is at
the top of his form. Superb condition
stood to Cynical over the last furlong,
where After Money took the lead, only
to be downed again in a thrilling finish.
Cynical has had four starts for three
wins and a third.
There were four divisions of the
Maiden Handicap. In the first Thebez
(evens), who carries the same colors as
the Sydney Cup winner Crucis, led
throughout; Dark Stage, from the north-
west, and Troy’s Gift were in the places.
Mudgee sportsman A. I. Cox won the
second division with Panhandle (10 to 1),
a half-brother to Wawina; it was a good
effort, as he started from the outside and
had to beat the favorite, Jambosa, for
the lead. Senorico, by Silver King’s sire
El Cacique, took the third division at
7 to 4 ; and Head Boy, a half-brother to
Leone, easily won the fourth heat. His
ring price was 25 to 1 ; his tote div. (one
of three) £l2 3s. 6d. for 10s.
* * * *
Skidmore had a field day at Epsom.
He rode two outright winners, and in an-
other event made a dead-heat for first
place. After squeezing home by half a
head on Some Hero in the Epsom Plate
he had to withstand a protest for inter-
ference lodged by Bailey, who had the
mount on Calulu King. The stewards
occupied a lot of time in disposing of
the objection, and, it being the last event,
McShortodds and as many of his clients
who felt disposed to wait did not leave
the course until the shades of night were
falling fast.
Both Skidmore and Bailey do a lot of
riding for Holt, trainer of Some Hero.
This gelding is far below the calibre of
his younger brother, Hall Mark, and in
being asked to carry 9st. 41b. on Satur-
day he was set a hard task. Bailey waited
for a run on the rails, hoping that Blue
Shot, the pacemaker, would hang out at
the home turn s Skidmore checkmated
these tactics by making a fast move on
the outside and preventing Blue Shot
from leaving the rails. Some Hero shot
to the front and set up a nice lead, but
Calulu King almost made a dead-heat.
Some Hero belongs to W. M. Gollan, of
Sydney, for whose wife Holt trained
Casque d’Or. There is not much likeli-
hood of Some Hero distinguishing him-
self in sprint events at the autumn meet-
ings ; on the other hand, Calulu King
might win a race like the Oakleigh Plate
or even the Newmarket. He is a Standish
Handicap winner.
Enterprise was shown by Adelaide
trainer E. H. J. Shaw in bringing the
Rampion filly Attract all the way to
Melbourne by motor-trailer to compete
in the Two-year-old Handicap. First
money in this event was only £l7O, but
the owner of Attract was provided with
a market that must have exceeded his
anticipations ; 10 to 1 could be obtained
at barrier-rise, and longer odds were
secured. Romany Faith started at 6 to 4.
Attract led all the way, and lasted long
enough to beat the Gilt Edge gelding
Long Set by a neck. Attract was bred by
H. A. Taylor, and is out of Donna Vara
by Poseidon, from Bhanavar (imp.).
How a horse whose chief qualification
is stamina can be put hopelessly out of
court by a muddling pace was exempli-
fied in the January Handicap. Robert,
a Burnewang colt, bred and owned by
A. G. Hunter, was served up a 6-to-4
favorite. Variance went to the front and
slowed down the field to such an extent
that the leaders were merely • cantering
after leaving the straight. Naturally this
did not suit Robert, who never once flat-
tered his backers. Dick Devon, a hand-
some little chestnut stallion, who won
the Heatherlie Handicap of 1933 and
afterwards developed trouble in the sus-
pensory ligament of his off foreleg, has
been patched up by Ray Turner, the
former cross-country horseman. He en-
gaged in a thrilling tussle with Three
Pips from the home turn, and the judge
could not separate them.
The January Handicap dead-heat was
not the only one. Kinfauns, who races
in the same interests as Calulu King,
shared winning honors with Nullden in
the first division of the Trial Stakes.
Second division went to Your Honor,
who belongs to A. G. Barlow. Johannes,
who annexed the Welter Mile, is owned
by J. Langley, a Paddock bookmaker.

Ins and Outs
“ ’Badian”: The first match between
England and the West Indies at Bar-
bados was in the freak class throughout.
Alternate rain and blazing sun provided
the captains with a problem in sticky
wickets. W.I. batted first for 102, Head-
ley being run out for 44. England lost
7 for 81, when Wyatt closed, hoping to
catch the others again on a gluepot and
then bat himself on an improved pitch.
Grant, giving nothing away, closed at 6
for 51, leaving England 73 to get and the
pitch still performing. The runs cost
six wickets to collect, Hammond follow-
ing a first-innings score of 43 with
29 n.o. Grant played the trick of the
double closure against Australia in the
fifth Test at Melbourne and brought it
off —the only Test won by the visitors.
* * * *
“Jolimont”: The dismal flop of N.S.W.
against Victoria in Melbourne was
largely due to Victoria’s left-hand bats-
men, who found the N.S.W. bowling, all
of the same slow type, with the exception
of Theak’s innocuous stuff, “like money
from home.” There is not a man on
Ma’s side able to send up the off-break
spinners which this type of batting calls
for, and there doesn’t seem to be one of
any calibre in the State which centres
in a harbor with a bridge over it.
The last of the genuine spinners Ma
boasted was McNamee, and there are
more unlikely things than that he may
be called on again ; he still gets wickets
in grade cricket. He is younger than
Blackie was when Blackie was at last
given his chance for Victoria, and might
prove a success again, if only as a
novelty.
jj: * *
“Aigburth”; I saw Jack Crawford (B.
19/12/’34) in h'is cricket prime in Aus-
tralia, and count one innings by the ex-
Surrey amateur in Brisbane for an Aus-
tralian Eleven against an English team the
most brilliant century I have ever watched.
All the same, I should hesitate to place
him as the greatest all-rounder who ever
played cricket in Australia. Leaving out
“W.G.,” I think that honor fairly goes
to Allan Steel, whose feats with bat and
ball for Cambridge, Lancashire and
England vied with those of Grace, of
whom he was a contemporary. Steel
came to Australia once only, in 1882-83,
when he headed the batting averages
with 30.61 for 22 innings and 152 wickets
for 6.57. In 20 Test innings Steel aver-
aged 35.29 with the bat, taking 29 wickets
for 20.86 apiece. He dropped big
cricket when called to the Bar, and died
Recorder of Liverpool some years ago.
* * * *
“Hotham”: During the recent match
with N.S.W. in Melbourne the V.C.A.
issued a standing invitation to luncheon
and other refreshing interludes to all old
Victorian representatives. Many ancients
accepted, the doyen being Judge Moule
of the 1880 Australian team m England,
the year of the first Test match on that
side. W. G. Grace’s contribution was
152 and 9, Billy Murdoch answering with
a duck and 153 n.o. W. H. Moule, as he
then was, took 3 for 23, and partnered
his skipper in a tenth-wicket stand of
which his share was 34. He is the only
survivor of that band.

Racquet and Bawl
Crawford vanquished Perry again in
the Australian singles championship at
Kooyong (Vic.). Perry had beaten
Stefani and McGrath in straight sets,
Stefani without losing a game ; Craw-
ford in his semi-final had had a five-set
match with Quist. But after Perry had
taken the first set, 6-2, he was mastered;
the next three were Crawford’s, 6-4, 6-4,
6-4 It was their 13th meeting and
Crawford’s fifth win, the last three in
succession.
Bromwich did well. He won the junior
championship, and, playing with the
seniors, he overcame the South African
Kirby by three sets to one. In the
doubles he and Huxley took two sets
from Perry and Hughes—Crawford and
McGrath beat the Englishmen in the
final —and the junior doubles were easy
for them. Dorothy Round captured the
women’s singles with the loss of a set
to Evelyn Lyle. The mixed doubles went
to Boussus and Miss Bickerton (N.S.W.).

“Let”: The renewed “offers” from
America to English tennis amateurs have
led to an interesting statement by
Dorothy Round, Miss Round is credited
with being a very particular young per-
son —she will not play tennis on Sundays,
and, on this account, always gives the
Continental championships the glassy eye.
Yet, in saying she had not received an
offer, the lady added she wouldn’t con-
sider it unless it was “more money than
I knew what to do with, and that is un-
likely” Just where and how did Miss
Round learn what her spending capacity
really is?

Indigestion in its early stages shows
its presence by attacks of heartburn,
wind, belching, palpitation or griping.
Later come the more serious agonies
of dyspepsia, gastritis, colitis and
ulcerated stomach, duodenum or bowel.
The stomach has been wonderfully
protected by Nature to withstand abuse,
but there comes a time when neglect
of small disorders upsets the whole
digestive system. The acids of the
stomach actually attack the fabric of
the walls, and vomiting, continual thirst
and severe pain indicate that ulceration
of the stomach has set in.
Serious though these complications
are, Nature will heal the ulcers if she
is given help. De Witt’s Antacid
Powder is especially prepared to help
in this healing work.
Firstly, it neutralises the excess acid
which the stomach continually produces,
and allays the irritation.
Secondly, the ulcers are coated with
a film of colloidal-kaolin. So finely
powdered is this kaolin, it is easily
spread over the entire surface of the
stomach, protecting the inflamed lining
from the hot, burning acids.
Thirdly, it actually digests portions of
your food, thereby still further taking
the load off the weakened stomach, and
finally, the ingredients in De Witt’s
Antacid Powder build up an alkaline
reserve in the body, that, with ordinary
care, there will be no recurrence of
your trouble.

At least one visitor to the postponed
Moorefield (N.S.W.) meeting came away
with the impression that the best three-
year-old in Australia —up to a mile, any-
how—is Capris. Capris did not start at
Moorefield, but Dromos did. Twice
beaten pointless by the handsome chest-
nut filly at Randwick, Dromos (5 to 1)
accounted for a good field in the mile
race for the £5OO Cup. Australia Fair (4
to 1), the runner-up, had a rough passage,
but so did Dromos, who was behind the
favorite at the turn into the straight, and
was going away from him at the finish.
Buonarroti ran a capital race, and was
just cut out of third place by Roman
Spear; Koda Pen, Turbine, Whitting-
ham and Wexford were among the beaten
horses.
On Dromos’s running, and her own,
Capris is a good thing for the Adrian
Knox Stakes. She may go on and win
the Doncaster, as Valicare did.
Ins and Outs
“Tenth Slip”: Sydney C.G. trustees
start next month on reconditioning the
old stands and building new ones, some
£BO,OOO being available. Most of it will
go into a new double-decker stand which
will take the place of the small northern
pavilion and the cubbyhouse the trustees
have so long reserved for themselves.
The new stand will have room for 15,000,
and will have a dining-room available
to the public. Another feature will be
a “cricket museum containing records
and photographs.”

“Five Ways”: There has been another
fuss in Queensland over the abo. bowler
Gilbert. The selection committee picked
him to play against Victoria in Brisbane,
but the superintendent at the settlement
where Gilbert abides jibbed for a time
“They must think I’m a slogger.”
at letting him, saying that the committee
wouldn t give the black a trip to the
southern capitals but was eager to grab
his services when they cost little. The
problem is an old one. If players have
fio scruples about travelling with an abo-
riginal, plenty of the public object to
his dining in the same rooms at hotels
and so on. Queensland found this out
long ago in the case of abo. Henry, an-
other fast bowler, and Jack Marsh also
presented N.S.W. with this problem (and
others) in the past.
“tt * c -
umgem : South Africa is trying a
new captain for this season s tour of
England. He is H. F. Wade, Natal s
skipper m the Currie Cup competition,
which answers to our Sheffield Shield ;
Cameron is vice-skipper. Wade has had
an unusual experience for an inter-
national captain, having played for
Several seasons in the professional York-
Shire League. The only other Leaguer
writer can recall who went from League
to international games was Barnes.
Plenty of stars have gone the other way,
finding refuge in the League when they
dropped out of the big stuff. The new
l.b.w. rule will be followed in all the
S.A. matches.

Breaksea Spit . Gai Waddy is
cu t ® am to Q ueer jsl a nd alter
he Sheffields, going as far as Rockhamp-
ton, with a couple of games on the
N.S.W. Northern Rivers on the way up.
These trips have been a great success.
Not only have they given the folk north
of Brisbane a chance of seeing world-
famous players—Grimmett, for instance,
will tour with this side—but they have
called attention to budding talent which
, would otherwise never have gained re-
cognition from the selectors in Brisbane.
A country player in a Queensland team
was once as rare as a modern batsman
game to hit a sixer. Several have been
honored of late years, though, as in
N.S.W., they have first to become metro-
politan residents.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Shirley”; The match between the
English golfers and M.L. on Heretaunga
links near Wellington saw the Britons
win, games to 2\. A feature was the
clash of Michael Scott and A. D. S.
Duncan, who have been playing first-
class golf for 40 years and more and
might be excused if their fancy now
lightly turned to bathchairs. Scott beat
Duncan 2 and 1 in the singles, but,
with McLean as a partner, went down
to Duncan and Horton in the foursomes.

“Divot Digger”: It would be interest-
ing to know which is the most expensive
of outdoor games. Golf must come
pretty near the top. A Sydney golfer
has stated that it costs him a penny and
three-eighths every time he hits a ball.
Here is his annual list. Car to links,
£4O; subscription, £8 Bs. ; green fees,
£3 18s. ; 52 balls, £7 165.; competition
fees, £4 ; caddie, £6 ; nineteenth, ss. per
week. Apart from his astonishing
moderation at the nineteenth, the player's
bill for balls is ridiculously small. Hagen
at his top couldn’t get through a week
with only one pill.

“Tabua”: Fired, no doubt, by the
example of Australia in importing golfers,
Fiji has determined to have a first-class
course which will attract distinguished
visitors, amateur and professional. There
is a movement afoot to spend £lO,OOO in
this direction, and, as the Governor has
given his approval, the scheme should
begin to take shape soon. Fiji has
already six 18-hole courses, in addition
to a nine-holer at Government House,
but none of these is up to championship
standard. G. P. Lane, coach of the
N.S.W.L.T.A., is booked for a season in
Fiji, where he will coach both in tennis
and golf.
Racquet and Bawl
“Cash Amateur”; Mr. O’Brien, of
America, who announced recently that
he had completed arrangements to
sign up Perry, Mrs. Whittingstall and
Helen Jacobs, is either another Mun-
chausen or a sorely deceived man. The
three players have repudiated him and all
his works. Perhaps the frankest denial
comes from Mrs. Whittingstall, who was
Eileen Bennett. She says she is doing
well at dress-designing—wasn’t she the
originator of pleated shorts?—and will
never surrender her amateurism except
f or enough to keep her in comfort for
the rest of her life

“Kooyong”; Melbourne tennis clubs
are thinking of scrapping their present
make of hard courts and putting down
others of the composition now in general
use in Europe—St. Kilda has led the
way. After grass, these patent courts are

“Top Spin”; They can’t keep away.
Helen Wills-Moody says she has re-
covered and will try her luck at Wimble -
don this season. She has long been eager
to equal the seven Wimbledon champion-
ships which stand to Mrs. Lambert
Chambers’s credit. Even if she is too
good for Helen Jacobs, she will strike
a tough ’un in Dorothy Round, who all
but defeated her when they met in 1933.

“Cut Shot”: Modern tennis champions
are apt to complain if they are asked to
play a couple of matches in a day. Lord
knows what some of them would say to
a day’s work put in by Tilden some years
ago and dug up for the edification of
the effete moderns. It was in a big
Yankee tournament, and Bill kicked off
at 10 a.m. When time was called at
6 p.m. he had played 157 games in
singles, doubles and mixed doubles. He
won the lot.
Miscellaneous
In a trial at Maribyrnong (Vic.) Tolan
ran 75 yards in 7 11-16 sec. He is to
have a cut at the 100 yards record,
unbeaten since 1912, when Jack Donald-
son turned off the distance in 9 3-ssec.
Tolan has grown black in the face
with indignation because somebody said
he was only a sprinter. He has
come out to prove, chapter and verse,
that he can perform well for distances
over the hundred, citing his 220 yards in
21 2-10 sec. But 220 is scarcely a long
distance. Tolan doesn’t give his times for
the quarter, the mile or the marathon.

“Fitzcray”: Tasmania took a facer
when her 21ft. restricted yachts Tassie
Too and Tassie 111, were beaten for
the Albert and Forster Cups, which the
pair had practically monopolised for
years. A Queensland craft, Gwylan, won
both. In the Albert Cup she finished
37sec. ahead of Tassie 111. ; Tassie
Too was less than a minute behind
Gwylan, so it was practically a blanket
finish. Gwylan was steered by the
veteran 18ft. skipper Fred Lucas, making
his debut as a helmsman in the re-
stricted class. In the final of the Forster
Cup Gwylan was 2sec. ahead of the
Victorian boat Eighteen Twenty. Gwylan
had taken the second heat
and been second in the first
heat to Milsonia (Vic.); Mil-
sonia was runner-up for the
cup. The nearest the Tas-
manian boats could get was
a third by Tassie 111. in the
first heat; they didn’t start in
the final.
The Northcote Cup for the
six-metre yachts was taken
for the third time by Too-
gooloowoo 11. The Mel-
bourne craft was designed by
the famous Scot, Fife, but
was built in Melbourne in
1929. She was beaten at her
first cut at the cup in 1931,
but has kept it in Melbourne
since then. Three new craft,
Judith Phil and Acrospire V.,
of Melbourne, and Sjo-Ro,
of Sydney, were expected to
shake her up, but they never saw her
heels for spray.

Australia has another great swimmer
in the making in Bill Kendall, a former
Sydney Grammar School boy. Last
week he had his first championship race
—he’s been swimming in club events
for Eastern Suburbs —for the N.S.W.
110 yards freestyle title at Manly, and
he clipped 2-ssec. off Noel Ryan’s best
figures by an Australian, beating Clark
and Ryan in 61 sec. He should have
done better ; there were two false starts
before they finally got away. Kendall
is going to Melbourne for the Austra-
lian 100 yards title at the end of the
month.

“Banzai”: Writing of the peculiar foot-
beat of the Japanese swimmers now in
Australia, a Sydney expert suggests that
it is an effect of their nation’s shuffling
flat-footed walk with bent knees. L have
watched Japanese playing tennisi and
Rugby and indulging in their lightning
sword-play during the visit of a man-o’-
war, and have seen no evidence of shuf-
fling. As for flat-footedness, a condition
which automatically throws a man out of
any military force in the world, it can
only be said that the Nipponese infantry
are rated among the world’s best
marchers. European soldiers first came
in contact with them on the march to
relieve Pekin during the Boxer Rebellion.
The Japs outmarched every European
contingent, even the British, most of them
fresh from three years’ tramping in South
Africa, having to dip their lids.

“Stretcher”; Sydney lost one of its best
rowing coaches when C. G. Saleh left
for Geelong. He has been very success-
ful this season, and has been responsible
for the rise of Haberfield, which club he
was preparing for the State championship
eights. He also had Sydney under the
wing, and was looking after Newington
into the bargain. Bernie Williams, of
St. Joseph’s, will take over the prepara-
tion of Haberfield for the State eights.

“To End Laissez-faire”
Mr. R. B. Bennett, Prime Minister of
Canada, says “the time has come to
change the economic system,” and that
his Government will go to the people on
a programme of economic reform.
Though he “raises the issue squarely and
nails the flag of progress to the mast-
head,” his programme is still to be an-
nounced. But there is one significant
statement: “In my mind reform means
Government intervention, control and
legislation to end laissez-faire. If we
cannot abolish the dole we should abolish
the system.”
High-sounding words indeed —and
spoken like a politician. One wonders
whether they are a sop for the Douglas
Credit people—their political party polled
rather well in Australia’s last Federal
election.
All the world is still struggling in the
toils of debt and collapsed markets. The
medium of exchange in times like the
present is not only fully valued ; it is at
a premium. Commodities, on the other
hand, are at a discount —a very heavy
one in some cases. We have not pro-
gressed in the last 35 years without a
great deal of waste ; every new inven-
tion has brought obsolescence in its wake.
Industries with large amounts of capital
sunk in fixed assets —railways, steamship
cos., coalmines, engineering shops, ship-
yards and textile mills —have all been
hit by the march of progress.
The financiers who put their own and
other people’s money into many such
enterprises anticipated that the working
assets would have a longer useful life
than the course of events proved. Obsoles-
cence has been an enormous factor in
post-war years. With Britain’s factories
and those of the rest of Europe out of
action during the war, America embarked
on a policy of mass-production. Other
countries have had to follow suit to be
anywhere in the race, and millions of
pounds’ worth of plant has been relegated
to the scrapheap.
Such plant may now be worth little or
nothing. The money owing on it is still
payable in the legal tender of the day—
money which in most countries will buy
a great deal more modern plant and fix-
tures than it would when the old machin-
ery was new. Many countries have set
about deliberately watering-down their
currency in order to bring costs more
into equilibrium with prices; but old
price-levels are not yet in sight.
It is hard to see how the extinction of
laissez-faire would help a country in its
struggles against obsolescence and over-
capitalisation. In Mr. Bennett’s country-
half the railways are privately owned,
and the Dominion is fortunate in that the
national railroads have the help of a lot
of 2 p.c. money. In Australia the social-
ised railways are a burden on the com-
munity.
Humans haven’t the single-purposed
community spirit of the antbed or the
beehive. Laissez-faire may not be so
self-regulating as economists of a former
age imagined, but it has worked better
than any form of socialism tried so far.
The commercial “system” and the finan-
cial “system”—one grows tired of the
words as mouthed by soapbox orators —
are scarcely systems at all. They have
grown up of themselves, like the bullock-
track which afterwards became Pitt-
street, Sydney. And, like Sydney’s streets,
they have many shortcomings. But who
would think of “abolishing” that city for
those reasons alone?
“Commission Only”
“Ironbarker”: I have had considerable
sales-organisation experience in Britain,
Canada and the U.S.A. In no part of
the world have I found such a large
proportion of salesmen engaged on com-
mission only as in Sydney.
Of 57 advertisers for travellers or sales-
men, 28 offered commission only, 21 re-
tainer or salary and commission, and
eight salary only. Retainers usually vary
from 10s. to 40s. a week. The “commis-
sion only” man may receive an advance,
and may be put off after his nominal
debt to the firm reaches £lO or £l2, hav-
ing meanwhile supplied lists of prospec-
tive customers.
From a cold-blooded point of view the
astonishing turnover in salesmen and the
methods involved may seem to pay, but
no firm can get 100 p.c. results from a
man who can’t carry on without worry,
and where the salesman has not enough
“Horses for me, sir! I been orf mines ever since me old man fell down the
Golden Deeps.”
to meet his fares even the small ad-
vances paid can be regarded as money
thrown away.
Selhng is a part of business that re-
quires more bramwork than is generally
realised. A salesman must be well
trained and have a thorough knowledge
selling It is
impossible for him to be loyal to a firm
that treats him like dirt.
Though there was a decline of
£13,200,000 in animal-product export
values for the five months ended Nov.
30, 1934, and of £300,000 in metals, in-
creases in almost every other section of
trade offset the fall by £2,000,000, half
of which was represented by edibles.
Meat exports showed about £BOO,OOO
increase. Imports, however, increased
by about £9,000,000 Australian.
* * * *
The Australian mining-share market
opened more strongly in the New Year.
Gold is up again, and more cos. have
reached the div. list. Though the gains
on the first few days’ ’Change operations
did not all hold, at the week-end the
position was still steady.

Australian Savings Bank deposits stood
at £213,395,000 on November 30 last —
£10,000,000 higher than at the same date
in 1933. All States showed an improve-
ment, but three-fourths of the added
capital came from N.S.W. and Victoria.
Queensland’s 7.6 p.c. was the best per-
centage advance.

One part of Roosevelt’s “New Deal,”
the law giving the Government control
of the petroleum industry, has been de-
clared unconstitutional. Now the void-
ing of the gold clause in Government
bonds is being tested in the Supreme
Court. Roughly £20,000,000,000 of secu-
rities will be affected by the issue (in-
cluding some Australian N’York loans),
and the whole basis of Roosevelt’s mon-
etary policy is at stake.

At the present time 25 policy-holders
in the A.M.P. Society may call a meet-
ing to consider any suggestion, however
trivial it may be. Such special meetings
usually involve an expense of about
£5OOO each. The directors are asking
policy-holders to alter the by-law so that

The Ro , Ban! , of Canada, though

apparently m sympathy with portions of
Roosevelt s policy most people will
approve of his efforts to curb the exces-
sive profits of some U.S. monopolies—is
not as gone on socialism as Prime Minis-
ter Bennett. From its November circular:
The Government which desires to secure
business co-operation in restoring em-
ployment must create conditions where
profits are possible. Such theories may not
sound idealistic, but it is important that
in this matter Governments should be
pragmatic: that they shall do that which
brings real recovery by the shortest route.
To create that stability which will permit
well-managed companies to make profits is
an object well worthy of pursuit. Business
is adaptable, and can acclimatise itself to
widely varying conditions, provided those
conditions remain stable. Uncertainty as
to future legislative action is most disturb-
ing. The business world seeks stability, and
prosperity can be best attained where basic
laws are unchanging and where peace is
assured.

“Crash”: Maoriland’s Finance Min-
ister Coates is busy on the farm-mort-
gage problem. A million is to be bor-
rowed from the public at 3 p.c. and re-
lent to farmers at p.c. The State
Advances Office is to be closed, and its
£50,000,000 of mortgages transferred to
a National Mortgage Corporation ; loans
are to be made up to 70 p.c. of the secu-
rity. Existing mortgages of the neces-
sary standard will be exchangeable for
corporation bonds. As the greatest
problem is to afford relief to competent
farmers whose security is insufficient
and who are deeply in arrears with in-
terest payments, “stay orders” or mora-
toria will be made for up to 10 years.

“Jesuit’s Bark”: I am thinking seri-
ously of trying to grow quinine in Aus-
tralia. Much of tropical N.Q. closely
resembles the quinine-growing areas of
the Netherlands East Indies, and the high
price of the product in ordinary times
would carry even the cost of white labor.
The Dutch tried to prevent export of
chinchona plants or seeds and failed;
still, cultivation so far is only in Malaya
and India, and on a small scale.
We have seen recently how scarce
and precious the drug can be in
times of emergency.

“Dungeness”: Working the black
sands on the N.S.W. Northern
Rivers and the S.Q. coast (B.
5/12/’34) is no new industry. Fifty
years ago dozens of men were busy
with them for their gold content.
A few miles to the Queensland side
of the Tweed River mouth there is
a deposit some distance out to sea.
After a heavy blow large quantities
of black sand are washed in. In
other places it appears after a gale when
the overburden of ordinary sand is
washed away. The little creeks and run-
lets which come down to the beach from
headlands also yield flake gold.

“G.M.”: Sandringham (Vic.), like
many other municipalities, has on its
hands a number of blocks of vacant land,
forfeited for non-payment of rates. The
customary procedure is to auction these
off and apply the receipts to liquidating
the debt. Sandringham ratepayers have
suggested that, instead of being sold, the
lands should be retained as public re-
serves. If this is done, Sandringham will
give a lead to other municipalities, and
within a few years there should be an
appreciable accession to park areas.

“Ponk”: That invisible electric ray
which is being used by Sydney jewellers
to guard their windows against smash-and-
grab artists has been enlisted for domes-
tic purposes in America. It is embodied
in a new mousetrap now on the market.
The ray is thrown across a mousehole,
above which is a hammer worked by an
electro-magnet. When the mouse comes
out and cuts the ray he is obliterated by
the falling hammer, and the trap sets it-
self for the next victim.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Thousands of imprisoned and rubber-
tyred horses ate up Macquarie-street and
Bridge-street and drew up, not a hair
out of place, at Government House doors
last Thursday night. Out of the cars
which they had driven popped more
than 700 of Sydney’s best-known and
best-dressed. To meet the extra rush two
cloakrooms were provided for the women
guests —just as well with so many noses
calling for a final dusting of powder!
This party was among the grandest given
by the Governor and Lady Game, and
once you had passed through the hall with
its masses of blue and pink hydrangea
and dropped your curtsy to the vice-
regals you found yourself one of a crowd
that looked more like a Town Hall re-
ception than a Government House party.
Church and State, Good Works and
Good Looks, Knights, new and old, and
0.8.E5. prattled amiably.
One of the most striking contrasts was
the grouping of the small Archbishop
Downey, of Liverpool, and Sydney’s tall
and wide-shouldered Archbishop Mowll.
Quite the most distinctive figure was the
hostess, whose trained frock was of
pearly satins, the corsage deeply van-
dyked in silver sequins. Spn Philip
threw his bright smile into the works,
and aides Gifford and Royce Shannon
were ever-present helps in times of need.
Lady Isaacs, who came from Canberra
for the party, wore violet slippers with
her opalescent velvets. Mrs. James Dick-
son’s handsome frock was of gold,
brocaded in peacock-greens and -blues ;
Lieut.-Gov. Street was there with his
wife, who wore red roses on her plati-
num laces. New knights Colin Stephen
and Harry Budge came with wives
frocked to do them proud.
The Dean of Sydney and Mrs. Talbot,
she in white satin, and Padre Micklem
and his bride, in vellum satin, were
among the much-surrounded church dig-
nitaries ; so was Apostolic Delegate Ber-
nadini. Above the clamor of clothes and
gems the diamond ornaments on Barbara
Knox’s black chiffons were noticeable.
The Riddle lady brought black laces, Mrs.
F. A. Maguire black chiffons and fran-
gipanni and Hubert Murray’s lady gold
lame. Alexander Gordon’s lady wore
diamonds with her Rhine-green crepes ;
ivory moire patterned in water-greens
formed an outstanding frock ; pink satins
were trailed by Mrs. A. C. Godhard.
The gardens and terraces were floodlit,
and the upper lawn was set for a gipsy
encampment, tents and campfire com-
plete, but the lightning flashed, the rain
fell, and not till supper-time did the
troupe of Russian gipsies dance and
sing upon the green. Charles Nicis and
Dominic Caruso sang during the evening.
One of the gifts Lady Game will
take away from Australia is a book of
beautifully-lettered names —not to be
confounded with the garden-party book.
The Book of Names was arranged at a
meeting convened by Lieut.-Governor
Street’s wife and Mayoress Parker. The
names have been gathered from the far
ends of the State as well as from the
city, but whether they are from Bunyip
Downs or Darling Point they are ex-
quisitely written in the same hand. It
is that of Eric Roberts, who is responsible
for the illuminated address, the English
of which is by Prof. Mungo MacCallum.
In addition, the book contains two water-
colors by Harry Dangar and Gladys
Owen: the first, a sketch of the
front of Government House; the
second is Lady Game’s favorite view,
looking down from the fountain across
the harbor. The whole is gathered
together in a Wal Taylor binding
of Madonna-blue leather, the cover gay
with a design of the Tudor rose, its
centrepiece an opal of primrose fires set
in gold. The backing is of Italian wall-
paper in an ancient design on which two
specimens of armorial poultry are in the
act of nipping a rose in the bud.
Still another garden party was thrown
into the waste-paper basket last week.
Parliament had planned a touching
farewell amid the flowers to Sir Philip
and Lady Game, but members’ wives
and their best hats made a unanimous
vote for the great indoors. The
Council Chamber, the Premier’s room
and the dining-room upstairs were
variously the setting for this junket-
ing. Downstairs was all pink and blue
hydrangea, and upstairs palms and gladi-
oli bloomed in profusion. Lady Game
wore a smart outfit in black and white
romaine, and her hat was large and
black. The Stevens couple and Council
President Peden received the vice-regals,
and Mrs. Stevens handed a luxury
bouquet to Lady Game. Gwen Stevens
topped her tunic frock of henna crepe
with a tiny turban of the same shade.
Mrs. Hugh Main’s large black hat was
gay with field-flowers.
Ellis Dettmann, elder daughter of Syd-
ney Grammar’s headmaster, takes her
brand-new B.A. and her keenness for
sports to the staff of the C. of E. Girls’
Grammar at the beginning of the school
year. Like the rest of the family, Ellis
has lots of brain ballast. This doesn’t
interfere with her fleetness of foot.
Cricket is her favorite game, and for
some time during her undergrad, days
she captained Sydney Uni. women’s
team.
The Mackay Sims pitched a marquee
on the lawn of Firenze, their Edgecliff
home, and here daughter Madeleine cut
the first slice of her wedding cake, sur-
rounded by smiling masses of blue
hydrangea and pink roses. Bridegroom
was Peter Seymour Dennis, of South
Yarra, Melbourne, and his parents and
sister, Mrs. David Mackey, had come up
from the South to see the marriage con-
tract blessed by St. Andrew’s Church in
Rose Bay, and then to mingle with the
gay groups made up of bridesmaids —the
five of them in love-in-a-mist-blue chiffons
and shady blue crinoline hats—the bride
in time-honored ivory satin, billows of
tulle and sheaf of lilies. Hyacinth-pink
georgettes, allied to large navy straw mil-
linery, were worn by Mrs. Mackay Sim.
’Groom’s mother was also navy-hatted,
but she added a white plume. Penelope
Mackey, the ’groom’s niece, was a deco-
rative little Kate Greenaway frainbearer,
poke bonnet, tight round posy and all.
Ruby Rich, who, before she took up
women’s movements so ardently, was
known as a brilliant musician, is return-
ing to Australia after seven years’
absence. During this time England was
her headquarters, and she frequently
represented this State as a delegate at in-
ternational conferences. Ruby, who is
due in Sydney next month, is now in
Constantinople, and is taking a look at
affairs in Palestine before tucking herself
finally into her homeward ship.
By eight o’clock the goldfish in their
ponds were securely netted against the
intrusive mosquito, the green lawns shone
like velvet in the floodlights. Beyond
their range the darkness of a starless
night hung over the rock gardens ; still
further away the golden lights of ferries
pricked the dark as they scurried across
Middle Harbor. The Chinese lanterns
were throwing pools of light on the wide
and timbered porches,
and the home of
Belgium’s Consul-
General was ready
for daughter Sophie’s
wedding party.
Sophie, who is now
Mrs. Fraser Coss,
and her husband had
decided to put off
their wedding cele-
brations till after
their honeymoon, so
that they could thor-
oughly enjoy them,
and not, as is the
way with newly-
weds, be snatched
from the midst of
the fun to catch a
train or a boat. This
party had all the
ingredients of suc-
cess. There were a
jazz band for the
dancers and a
snugly - fitted - up
porch for the bridge
players. The wed-
di n g cake, the
luscious meringuey
masterpiece of a
Viennese chef, was
topped by curlicues
of rose-red marzi-
pan, and the pop-
ping of corks was
almost as continu-
ous as the strains of
the band.
There was almost
a complete muster
of the Consuls and their wives (Mr.
Segaert, owing to popularity and length
of Sydney residence, is known as dean
of the corps), and opera was represented
by Florence Austral, John Amadio and
Ben Fuller’s lady. Mrs. Segaert’s ice-
blue chiffons were patterned in black ;
Mrs. Coss, who is a radiant blonde, wore
turquoise crepes; sister Mrs. Brenac’s
lace frock was berry-red ; red was the
choice, too, of Dorothy Coss, the
’groom’s pretty young sister. Norway’s
Mrs. Hans Fay was a swirl of tea-rose
pink flounces. Black moire that as she
moved was faintly starred with gold
adorned America’s Mrs. Caldwell, The
shipping T. S. Gordons, Mrs. Hedinger,
Eve Hubbard and the Jacques Playousts
were other pleasant people who cheered
the fireworks display that festooned the
midnight hour.
The Arts Club party had been
planned on cosy lines, and if the vice-
reine had been asked to describe it she’d
probably have replied with a twinkle,
“Good-oh!” or “Bonzer!” two Australian
terms for which she has declared her
fondness. Lord Sempill was a distin-
guished tea-drinker. President Mrs.
Florence Taylor sped the parting and
welcomed the arriving guest with the
appropriate and ever-ready word. Packed
with Lady Game in the home-going car
was a delicately-painted harbor view,
chosen from the club walls.
“Like Hampstead Heath with the lid
off,” remarked one visitor in a sniffy
tone ; but then she was a charity worker
whose interests do not include the Bush
or the District Nurses. The theatrical
garden party in Government House
grounds was for these two associations.
Also it was a public farewell to Sir Philip
and Lady Game. A citizens’ army of
anything between 12,000 and 12,000,000
trod the lawns steadily between the hours
of two and five-thirty.
Some guests saw those wise monkeys
Freddie and Freda driving up in their
taxi; some saw nymphs and dryads
dance upon the lawn ; some saw the top
of Lady Game’s hat as she stepped about
the garden ways saying farewell. Only
a superman or a bird could have seen
everything, and only the thrice-blessed
snatched a satisfactory tea. Tennyson’s
Fair Women, the glory of their robes
a bit pallid in the light of day, went
about their affairs; billows of white or-
gandie launched a mammoth freight of
cigarettes. Operatic voices burst in
Bengal flares and rainbow rockets of
sound within the drawing-room.
Paris says long hair for woman, be
she deb. or dowager. New Yorkers are
busy growing theirs, and the young
things have all developed topknots of
soft curls. Black for daytime is still the
smartest wear, and the Cossack caps and
the tricornes crown the most elegant
heads. Imitation jewellery is worn by
every woman, jade being the moment’s
rage. Gems in barbaric settings are im-
pressive, and are worn indiscriminately
by daylight or nightlight. In spite of
medical authorities, the beauty expert is
still implored to help iron out the
exuberant curve. Woman counts her
calories daily, one by one, and achieves
slenderness and the slinky clothes of her
desire.
In the afternoon sunshine swords glit-
tered bravely as they flashed into an arch
of steel outside St. Mark’s at Darling
Point. The two who passed blushing
beneath the cutlery were Kathleen Evans,
of Gosford, and Lieutenant Charles
Reid, R.A.N.; they had just been
launched into matrimony by Canon
Howard Lea. Two daffodil ’maids, in a
golden mist of tulle, followed the trail
of the bride’s ivory satin and Madonna
lilies. The ’groom comes from Oakleigh,
Victoria. Toasts were drunk at Hampton
Court.
Gloves will play an important part in
the autumn scenario. For day wear the
smartest shades are brown, navy, black
and chamois, the last worn with blues
and browns. For afternoons white, egg-
shell, blue and red, and in the evening
pastel pinks and blues, in addition
to the immemorial white kid, will have
a vogue. Red, too, will be worn, made
more Carmenesque with touches of silver
or gold. Hats are giddy with pom-poms,
feathers, furry tufts, tassels and quills.
Crowns are high and reckless —their
slogan seems to be “the sky’s the limit.”
Though kasha flannel scarves are tipped
for wear with casual clothes, you can
still make a hit with the girl friend by
handing her a sable or a silver-fox pelt.

FACTS!
The only type of
circulation that
has real worth is that which is constant and
embodies the confidence of readers. These
attributes are possessed only by the daily
newspapers whose circulations are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-
sure methods, but by real merit. They are
bought because people want them in their
homes.
The daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New Zealander that even in times ol
economic stress he continues to buy his
morning daily, so valuable is it for the
information it gives, both in its news and
advertisement columns.
Newspaper advertising is the most economical,
effective and forcible medium for reaching
the New Zealand public.

Chatter
Porfsea, Sorrento, Flinders, Barwon
Heads, Queenscliffe, Lome —all roads
lead tq the beaches during Melbourne’s
short and unreliable summer. Rents of
houses soar to the region of £l5 per
week; at Long Island a very simple cot-
tage provides its owner with a weekly
golden egg varying from 7 to 12 guineas.
Those who like the simple life pack chil-
dren, dogs, cocoanut oil, fishing tackle,
meat-safe and tent in their cars and go
camping at Rosebud or, if they prefer
the excitement of the surf, the coast near
Anglesea. Last week eight young things
set out for Lome in Meandering Myrtle,
a lorry owned by Peter and Tim Russell.
They took a chaperon, who did most of
the cooking, and a wooden shanty on
the beach in which to eat and sleep. In
between swims they all crowded into
their chariot, and with a maximum of
mechanical clatter went bounding over
bush tracks and along the Ocean-road.
Drivers who came face to face with
Myrtle on the ocean route had a bad few
minutes, especially if they were travel-
ling on the outer side of the road with
a sheer drop of 200 feet. However,
Myrtle came back to Melbourne intact
despite her size, wheel-wobble and
habitual antics of a pantomime dame.
As a farewell to some of their friends
who are off on summer holidays Captain
and Mrs. Ernest Jones mixed an im-
promptu cocktail last week. At the party
the host’s Christmas present from
Chicago, “bottoms-up” glasses of pale-
green opalescent glass, were christened.
Their origin goes back to the days of
Viking hospitality, when tankards were
drained to the dregs, for they could only
be made to stand up upside down. Mrs.
Jones wore black, with a square collar
of crisp white organdie. She arranged
masses of gorgeous gladioli, cornflowers,
roses and lilies in large brass vases, pink
hydrangeas in a willow-pattern bowl
standing upon a willow pedestal, and
sprays of lily-of-the-valley-tree in smaller
vases. Among the guests were Dr. and
Mrs. Percy Shelton, she in black-and-
white stripes, who are off to M.L. by this
week’s Wanganella. Accompanying their
medico husbands were Mrs. Harry Pur-
nell, in a brown-scrolled white silk frock,
and Mrs. Charles Adey, in floral crepe.
This foursome will share a bungalow at
Point Lonsdale. Mrs. Cyril McCarthy
placed two white organdie flowers upon
her black dress, and a little white bird
alighted on the crown of her black hat.
Congratulations were offered to newly-
gazetted Wing-Commanders F. Lukis and
A. Hepburn.
The Association for the Advancement
of Science (known as the A3S) holds con-
ferences every two years, and it is 14
years since such a number of scientific
brains were gathered together in Mel-
bourne. For membership of the A3S
scientific qualifications are not necessary,
for, although highly technical lectures
entitled “Molecular Conductivity of
Aqueous Solutions,” “Crucial Advances
in Chemical Theory during the Last Half
Century,” “The Making of Selves”
(Psychology, Philosophy and Education
section) are on the itinerary, there will be
several lectures and papers on lighter
subjects. Also, excursions by train and
car and social functions, including a
garden party at G.H. and an evening
reception at the National Museum and
Gallery, which has not been used for
such an event since the visit of the Prince
of Wales.
Blamire Young, whose death early in
the week left a gap in Melbourne’s
artistic circle, was a man of many parts.
A Cambridge graduate, his first job in
Australia was as assistant master at
Katoomba, in the Blue Mountains. Phil
May was in Sydney at the time, and asso-
ciation with him deepened Young’s deter-
mination to become a painter. He went
back to England, studied at the Her-
komer School, and then took up poster
work, a branch of art in which he intro-
duced fresh ideas to Australia when he
returned. War-time found him in-
structing Kitchener recruits in musketry
and machine-gunnery. In the early post-
war period he made his name as a water-
colorist, exhibiting at the Royal Aca-
demy and being elected to the R.I.P.W.C.
Returning yet again to Australia, he be-
came art critic of Melbourne “Herald”
—many years earlier he had contributed
to the “Lone Hand” some very sound
analyses of the work of contemporary
Australian painters. His work, which
shows to> a very marked degree the influ-
ence of the Japanese masters of line
whom he studied in his poster days, is
represented in most Australian galleries.
He was 72 at the last milestone.
After 26 years of silence the post office
chimes were heard again on New Year’s
Eve, and they continue to peal occasion-
ally. Perhaps it is their long term of
idleness or it may be that the mechanics
who pull levers have yet to make adjust-
ments in the inner workings, but the
chimes are not very musical, and some
of their notes are distinctly out of tune.
People who live near the corner of
Bourke and Elizabeth streets are think-
ing of moving to the suburbs, for even
cotton-wool in their ears does not ob-
literate the din during the early hours of
the morning.
For £2 10s. anybody with a horse and
cart or a lorry may get one of the Vene-
tian poles which caused such a hubbub
of criticism four months ago ; of the 800
being taken down 400 are for sale. Adel-
aide wants some for its centenary. The
poles did good service during Mel-
bourne’s celebrations, but their effect
lay in their numbers, which provided
avenues of twinkly orange, lemon and
salmon-pink lights. The pylons, too, are
being removed, and most of the buildings
have dismantled their colored lighting.
But the job of clearing up is slow.
The Dickinson-Monfeath picture is of
Louie Dunn, who, after a year of hard
work, is seeking relaxation by swimming
and sun-bathing. Miss Dunn is a teacher
of dramatic art, and went to Adelaide
as adjudicator for the last competitions,
where she heard 1000 candidates in three
weeks. In addition, she judged dialogues
and Shakspearean and modern plays.
Sessions averaged 10 a.m. to 11.30 p.m.,
but Miss Dunn declares that an adjudi-
cator’s brain does not slide into a state
of coma. He or she remains interested
(though it is trying to hear 87 children
under eight recite the same piece one
after another), and becomes impervious
to the varying reactions of the audience
towards a charming little girl with blue
eyes and dimples and a small boy with
grubby knees and a squint. Miss Dunn’s
pupils did particularly well at Ballarat
in all branches of speech training. In
addition, they defended their record of
the three-act play, an event in which they
are successful every year.
At last steps are being taken for radi-
cal reform in the uniforms worn by
Guides and Guiders. Since the incep-
tion of the movement many girls have
refused to join, up because they consid-
ered the uniform hideous, and simply
couldn’t bear to think of themselves in
black cashmere stockings. In our Aus-
tralian climate thick serge coats and
skirts made according to old-fashioned
and uninteresting patterns must be devi-
talising mentally and physically. The
little Brownies say that their navy dresses
of heavy cotton cloth don’t show the dirt
(until they get very grubby) and that they
are strong for climbing and romping—
but what a dark, drab color in which to
plunge happy childhood! Lady Scouts
in their bottle-green frocks and the group
of girls in khaki dresses with skirts
tailored, not just bunched round the waist
with a bean-bag belt, looked the most-
comfortably-clad members of the Guide
movement during the jamboree. Mrs.
Storrow, of America, recommends the
color of the grey-green cloth used for the
uniforms of Uncle Sam’s Guides, and
their hats with shallower crowns and
soft brims which may be twisted and
tilted to conform with prevailing mil-
linery fashions.
Here is a Broothorn portrait of Irene
Crespin, secretary of the hospitality com-
mittee of the Science Congress, which
commences to-day. Miss Crespin, who
was educated in Melbourne, where she
took an Arts degree with geology as a
major subject, is assistant Common-
wealth Palaeontologist. Within the last
few years she has been on study cruises
to Fiji and New Caledonia, and to New
Caledonia she hopes to return, being
confident of unearthing certain valuable
fossils which have so far eluded her.
The complete obliteration of Melbourne
hospitals’ debts, a new railway station,
another bridge over the Yarra and the
brightening up of Port Melbourne with a
paintbrush were a few of the suggestions
received for a memorial to the pioneer
women of Australia. The idea of a
sunken garden proved most appealing to
the committee, and it was also the least
costly of any suggested plan. But the re-
sult of the completed scheme is disappoint-
ing. The women who worked so hard
for the garden hoped that it would be
planned by and taken care of by the
women gardeners of Melbourne. But
the Government had other views. It
gave the land, an enviable portion of
Alexandra Gardens, from which hun-
dreds of tons of earth were moved to
give a “sunken” aspect, and it did the
job in its own way with sustenance labor.
The garden is oblong, with two rounded
corners. Its perpendicular sides are of
rocks tightly wedged together, and there
is a narrow flower-bed planted with
annuals and two yew-trees in treacle-
tins. At the deepest end of the garden
there is an aqueduct of electric-blue tiles
into which water gushes from a lion’s
mouth. The tiled walk around the pool
is the most attractive part of the scheme.
In the centre of the pond a giant frog
sits among water-lilies. He must have
been removed from other Governmental
property, for corrosion has eaten away
several of his toes and nearly all of one
foot.
Mrs. Wordsworth James, at present on
a visit to Melbourne, is compiling a book
which is to be called “The Cloth of
Memory.” The story of the book com-
menced many years ago when a friend
presented her with a piece of Irish linen
which, instead of making into a tea-
cloth, she used for a collection of sig-
natures. Friends, relatives, representative
citizens and celebrities wrote upon the
cloth their signatures in pencil, which
were afterwards embroidered. A few
years later there was no remaining space
upon the linen, and signatures on paper
were attached all the way round to the
lace edging. Mrs. James is now transpos-
ing her list of 1000 signatures to her
book. Pertaining to each name, which is
printed in scarlet old English lettering,
will be an accompanying paragraph or
verse of personal interest.
The Prince of Wales, Kitchener, pros-
pector Pat Hannan, Douglas Jardine,
John Monash, Eric Campbell, De Groot,
Aloysius Horn, Daphne Akhurst, Sir
Alan Cobham, General Birdwood, Mrs.
Fred Niblo (Enid Bennett) and Gerald
du Maurier are a few of the mixed col-
lection of 1000 names.
Mrs. Wordsworth James has had ex-
perience of mining towns. She spent 10
years in Kalgoorlie, where she watched
John Forrest turn on the tap which offi-
cially opened the goldfields water supply ;
she has lived in Ballarat and Bendigo,
and went through the Klondyke on her
visit to Alaska. She considers Sitka in
Alaska the most beautiful place she has
ever seen. Other parts of the world
which appeal to her particularly are
Brittany she went there for three weeks
and stayed five months —Tasmania and
the tall timber country of Gippsland,
where she spent her early married life.
Knight Edward Mitchell and his lady
are becoming accustomed to the reflected
glory of novelist daughters. Younger
chick Janet, who is at present abroad with
her sister Mary, has just had her first
novel, “Tempest in Paradise,” the plot of
which is laid in Manchuria, accepted by
Geoffrey Bles. Janet went to Asia in
1931 as a delegate to the Conference of
Pacific Relations in Shanghai. She
travelled through Korea and Japan, and
lived for months in Harbin. On her
return to Australia she commenced her
novel and prepared a series of lectures
and magazine articles which have been
published in English papers.
Mary Mitchell’s “Swings and Round-
abouts” will shortly be issued in a jacket
designed by Heinemann. Her best-seller,
“A Warning to Wantons,” was published
a year ago. People who know Miss
Mitchell well constantly remark upon the
dissimilarity in every characteristic be-
tween herself and the polished little gold-
digger who is the heroine of “Wantons."
But with a world full of material to draw
upon, why should an author use herself
as a model for any of her characters?
Great crowds rolled up at Kooyong
courts for the championship tennis, and
many people stayed all day, occasion-
ally cooling off with ice-creams and
absorbing lemon drinks out of bottles,
per medium of straws. One man arrived
at 10 a.m. with several children, whom
he arranged with picnic-hampers under
a beach umbrella in the back row of the
2s. 6d. stand. The family was still there
at 6 p.m.
Mrs. Westacott (Q.) usually wears plain
tennis dresses, but for her semi-finals
against Dorothy Round she favored the
divided skirt of pleated linen. Miss D.
Greenwood is a dashing young thing who
owns several pairs of shorts —some are
colored and are made as an all-in-one
garment, like flared romper suits. She
commenced one of her doubles matches
in cream silk shorts, a yellow knitted
jumper and a white hat with a squashy
high crown.
One of the gayest parasols seen at the
tennis was a ruched affair which made
a splodge of tangerine and sunset-gold
in the life-members’ stand. Dark-blue
and dark-green smoked-glasses with white
rims were popular; so were scarves,
and (with the men) hankies tucked into
their hats as neck-protectors. A few
brave spirits removed their coats, but
in the members’ stands the men just sat
and cooked, without a summer-weight
suit or a solar topee among them.
Madge Elliott and Cyril Ritchard were
there on several occasions. Signora de
Stefani was present every day; so were
Madame Menzel—she looked smart one
afternoon in a frock of sulphur-yellow,
with a bright scarf of green, blue and
burnt-orange —and Mrs. Pat O’Hara
Wood. Helen Sage watched all in brown.
Madge Calder in a China-blue-and-white
patterned frock, Mildred Vaughan wear-
ing blue-and-beige georgette, Pen Stead
in a white beret with a peppermint-stick
dress and June Bailie in a spring-green
suit and a large white hat were noticed
among the spectators. Mary Russell wore
a big brown hat, Barbara Weigall a blue
linen coat with black millinery and Biddy
Bullivant blue neckwear, a repetition of
the color of her shady, blue straw.

Mixed with the joys that visit us,
Why the tares amid the grain,

Why the venom in the snake,
Why the Martyrdom of Man,

Steals a surreptitious look,

Into his own ungodly scrawl.
Thus our author, deep and sly,
An inexpert manipulator,
Cribbed whatever caught his eye
From some cleverer creator.

Prize-
winners
The three win-
ning entries in
the A.B.C.’s radio
play competition
have been broad-
cast to prove thai
there is nothing new under the sun.
Apart from being devoid of wit or
humor or thrill, they are mere ghosts of
mid-Victorian melodrama.
The first choice, which won £5O, tells
of a villain who trusts a colleague in a
plan to escape from gaol. The scheme
fails, and the schemer hits a warder and
is given another 25 years or so for his
trouble. He comes out to find his accom-
plice managing a great business, and
blackmails him, using the diction and
technique of the old-fashioned burglar.
Dan Barry would have thought him too
loud. Bill Sikes was a whisper beside
him.
The last scene is the best. The black-
mailee’s family, surrounded by luxu-
rious cars and reinforced by a young
man with a voice like a dude of the ’nine-
ties, is waiting for daddy to come home
on his birthday to hear a birthday greet-
ing broadcast to him—big businessmen
just love these little radio attentions —but,
instead, a constable arrives with the news
that daddy has murdered his tormentor,
who has been squeezing him for his last
£5OO. In spite of the feminine shrieks,
I was glad. I hoped the scoun-
drel who had been battered would not
come to life again— at least on the radio.
Play No. 2 was called “Light Breaking
Through.” A married gent, has been
offered a job at £6 a week increase on his
present salary. Manlike, he puts his wife
into a car and takes her to a fishing
resort to camp till she can make up her
mind about it. A stranger gives them
fish, and they ask him to breakfast. Hus-
band discovers that he has left his pipe
“over by that log there.” Conveniently
Shaking half an hour to retrieve it, he
I leaves his wife with the stranger, who is
just leaving for Vancouver. They hold
an interminable conversation about light
and love and other interesting topics, and
the stranger swears that as he leaves he
will arrange for the motor-’bus to toot
four times. Heaven knows why. Hus-
band returns. Wife decides not to accept
the job. Motor-’bus toots rudely. There
may have been some motif in the flood
of redundant words. If there was, I
missed it.
During the third effort, I had a good
sleep, but woke up in time to realise that
Satan was appearing in apparently
human form to carry off an eighteenth-
century scoundrel.
I wonder if that ever
has happened before on
the stage. I also wonder
whether three such banal,
ill-constructed and amateur-
ish efforts have ever before
won a national competition.

The
Mike-shy
Tell the
World
Yes ? Aus-
tralia did
have a unique
o p p ortunity
of telling the
world all
about itself
in the Em-
pire broad-
c a s t and
missed its chance (B.
2/1 / ’35).
Efforts are being made to
cast the responsibility on to
the British authorities, who
demanded broadcasts from
certain specified individuals.
This won’t hold water ; the
blame belongs to Australia.
The British Broadcasting
Commission asked that
messages be given from a
number of representative
Australians. The choice was
remarkably good; 8.8. C.
asked, among others, that
stories should be spoken
into the mike by a South
Australian wheatgrower, a
Sydney surf guard, a gar-
dener at the Melbourne
Botanical Gardens and a
worker on the East-West
line at Nullarbor Plain.
Nobody possessing a
knowledge of Australia can
fault any of these. The
British idea was first-class ;
the Australian organisation
for carrying it out was be-
neath contempt. The men
concerned were asked, it
would appear, to speak at
a given time, and then were left to do the
job as best they could. Any experienced
publicity man or any experienced news-
paper man knows that the man, however
exalted, who insists on writing his own
interview turns out tripe which the reader
never finishes. People who are not
exalted but who, by force of circum-
stances, find themselves suddenly on
front pages are usually utterly inarticu-
late if a reporter simply asks them to tell
their story.
The capable reporter does nothing of
the sort. He has a yarn with them —a
yarn about the best thing for the Hurdle,
the beauty of the new barmaid at the
Royal, the iniquities of Lang or Lyons,
the merits of bodyline, Hitler, Mussolini,
the latest burglary or anything else that
people are talking about. Incidentally,
he mentions the subject on which the
man’s views are sought, and leaves the
man under the impression that he has
told him nothing whatever of public
interest.
Next morning when the interviewee
sees his remarks under big headlines he
stands aghast at his own unrecognised
importance. The next interviewer will
have a harder job. Knowing the methods
pursued the man to be interviewed will
have for ever in his eye those hundred-
thousand-odd people reading his obser-
vations, and will so color—or discolor—
what he says that the interview will be
bald and uninteresting.
I have a theory that anybody can write
or speak if he can only divest himself of
self-consciousness. When the first mails
arrived from the men who went to the
Boer War, I was handed a dozen letters
to relatives which had been brought into
Lumberjack,” an Oscar Binder etching shown at
the Athenaeum, Melbourne.
the Melb. “Argus” office. I was in-
structed to “knock them into shape.”
When I read them, 1 stood scared of
losing my job when the men came back ;
they were all born journalists. The
letters required no knocking into shape
—not the mark of a blue pencil except
to strike out personal stuff. But what a
different tale when those same men had
received the papers in Africa and knew
they had won a place in print. They
wrote their next letters with an eye on
the public. There was nothing natural
about the stuff. Not one of them was
worth publishing. My job was safe.
If the Australian Broadcasting Com-
mission knew these principles of writing
or speaking—which are practically the
same thing—they would have had the
men suggested by Britain interviewed
until the last drop of information about
their professions and experiences had
been wrung out of them. Then the mass
of information would have been
assembled by an expert for transmission.
The dramatic incidents of the average
man’s calling are routine to him and
have to be dragged out of him. Having
got them, they can be placed in their
best order and given to him to broad-
cast. There is no fake about this ; it is
his own stuff, his honest experiences, his
honest hopes. All that is done is to
throw into the scrapheap the mass of
redundancies which he mistakenly re-
gards as possessing public interest.
Had the Broadcasting Commission
organised its staff to do this, the Empire
messages from Australia might have held
their own with those of other lands
(which obviously pursued the only effi-
cient method of securing matter of world-
wide interest) and would have been re-
ceived with joy by millions of listeners.
MONTAGUE GROVER.
A Word for
Woman
“T y 11 Owl-
glass’s” talking of
“Women, Novels
and Libraries”
(B. 12/12/’34) re-
minds one that
women have failed in music as badly
as in literature — i.e., from the creative
standpoint.
No woman has ever composed a grand
opera, symphony, mass, overture or
oratorio worth mentioning, and so no
woman composer remotely approaches
Bach, Beethoven, Handel, Schubert,
Wagner, Haydn and hosts of other giants
of musical composition.
But as an interpreter of literature and
music—that’s another story—remember

Eucharistic Conference just concluded.
At each end of the hall hang two
large mural paintings of the “Path to

Archbishop Mannix and one of Dr. A.
L. Kenny, wearing the brilliant uniform
of a Knight of St. Gregory, which made
him a conspicuous figure in the recent
celebrations.
At the Macquarie Galleries, Sydney, is
the harvest of Lionel Lindsay’s sojourn
in furrin parts —19 tinted drawings and
a dozen etchings. As an extra a wood-
block, “Pheasant and Wisteria,” a beauti-
ful piece of craftsmanship, is shown. The
drawings, sure and snappy in line, had
their origin in France, Spain, Italy and
Holland. Their effect is enhanced by
the excellence of the figures. The etch-
ings are still more effective, and one of
the most striking of these will find a
place in Sydney National Gallery.

QUEENSLAND.
THE LITTLE SISTERS.
The Brisbane presswomen entertained
Marjorie Bulcock at morning-tea at
Rowe’s before she left for England,
and Una Vowles hostessed an afternoon-
tea at Rowe’s. Una’s was a “discourtesy”
party, and the guests who so far forgot
themselves as to say “Please” or “Thank
you” were fined. A sheaf of telegrams
was handed to the guest.
Mr. and Mrs. H. W. Remington, who
have been away from Australia for two
years, return by the Monterey. H.W.
is the general foreign manager for the
Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Co., and in the
two years has visited almost every coun-
try in the world. Mr. and Mrs. John V.
Moran went over to Maoriland to meet
the travellers, and returned with them.
The marriage of Audrey Mackay to
C. A. Jorss will take place at the Church
of the Transfiguration, Norman Park,
on January 24. Joy Griffith, of Wondai,
and Thyra Nimmo will be bridesmaids
and F. C, Jorss best man.
The Marella left Brisbane with our
vice-regals on board. Sir Leslie looked
as cheerful as a schoolboy on the first
day of his holidays. Lady Wilson and
son Peter also seemed pleased with the
prospect of a few weeks’ freedom. Mar-
jorie did not go, and she probably will
spend most of the time at Coochin with
Aileen Bell.
Mrs. Coventry Wilson, of Rockhamp-
ton, who has been studying economics
in America, Germany, France and Eng-
land for the last 12 months, is home
again on the Baradine. She said that
England and Italy were in the best posi-
tion to-day, but that things were bad
in Germany and U.S.A., where she saw
a bank held up by gunmen.
Mavis Mundell, youngest daughter of
the George Mundells, of Redmarley,
Miles, has an engagement ring. The
young man is Bill Ewart, of “Thursday.”
A party of undergraduates from Perth
arrived in Brisbane by the Mongolia on
Monday, January 14, en route to
Noumea. Frank McGrath, president
of the University Union, planned out
a round of entertainments for them, in-
cluding a trip to Ret 11 and Bay.
Karma Eklund, one of Daphne Mayo’s
most promising pupils—she designed the
gargoyle that ornaments the Grey-street
Bridge—has abandoned art for matri-
mony with Walter Matheson, only son
of Mr. and Mrs. C. Matheson, of Mary-
borough. There were no bridesmaids,
and the bride wore white organdie and
a wide-leafed hat.
Eileen Mackay, daughter of the J. E.
Mackays, of Haberfield, Sydney, is en-
gaged to Euston Moore, the youngest
son of the A. E. Moores. They are a
good-looking pair.
Nancy and Jean Blane will sail for
Maoriland and Europe early next month.
Dr, and Mrs. T. A. Price (Too-
woomba) have a house party at South-
port. Their guests include Mrs. Harvey
Price, Queenie Rees (Sydney), Joan
Fenner (Toowoomba), Ethel O’Keefe
and Owen Lamb. Daughter Rosamund
is also with them.

voile was hand-worked with minute
flowerets; Dulcie Allen combined lemon
lace with georgette; Bette Davies undu-
lated with a ripple of pink elephant
crepe; and Cath Cumpston caught the
eye with pillar-box taffetas.
Tom McGregor made racy responses
to a welter of hastily-arranged toasting
parties before his departure for Q’land.
The final flutter was at medico Ambrose’s
home, with son Ross as host. Sister
Gwenyth ran competitions in a snowy
confection of georgette and camellias,
and Betty and Deborah, girt respectively
with black satin and blue chiffon, helped
to entertain.
Sir Archibald and Lady Weigall and
Miss Priscilla Weigall were guests at a
luncheon-party given at the Esplanade by
Mrs. Hudson Eastwood, who is staying
with her parents, Mr. and Mrs. H.
Edmeades. The hostess’s navy-blue
crepe de Chine with its flowers of white
and green was first seen in the drawing-
room, where Lady Weigall’s biscuit silk,
traced with brown, was next Miss Wei-
gall’s navy-and-white ensemble.
Perth College chapel heard vows ex-
changed by Margaret Edmiston and
Frederick Oldham, with Archdeacon
Huddleston to give a blessing. The
bride’s pastel-pink satins, with heavily-
shirred sleeves, were clouded with the
mist of a pink lace and tulle veil. Sister
Kathleen undid the glove in caped
Marina-green crepe, flecked with pink
and topped with flower-decked green
ballibuntal. Wee attendants Mollie Child
and Shirley Oldham swished Kate Green-
away frocks of pink silk net, strewn with
hand-made flowers.
The New Year brought a Marina ring
of sapphire and diamonds to “Bob”
Johnson, of Maddington, who has given
her promise to “Bob” James, knight
Walter and his lady’s youngest son.
City hotels, full to overflowing during
the holiday season, are slowly emptying.
Mrs. Maude Dempster, the Lionel Vie-
vashes and the Northam Walshes have re-
turned to their home town; the J. C.
Phillips family and the Henry Clarksons
are back in Toodyay ; Geraldton’s Grants
have flown home to their nests ; and the
Henry Cookes dashed back to Tammm
to gather the family for a holiday at
Cottesloe.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
In spite of unfavorable weather the
bazaar at Castlemaine, Victor Harbor,
the home of knight William Sowden and
his wife, proved a success, £6O being
raised to liquidate the debt on the Girl
Guides’ hall. Mrs. H. S. Hudd, gowned
in biscuit georgette and a hat to tone,
made the opening speech. The Sowden
lady wore a navy taffeta jacket with a
red-navy-and-beige-pat'terned silk frock
and a small red straw hat.
Eileen Harrison-Bourke and P. Mc-
Mahon Glynn, whose marriage will take
place on the 23rd, were guests of honor
at a cocktail party given by Mr. and
Mrs. F. Briea Molony. Host and hostess
received in their lounge, which was deco-
rated with delphiniums and gladioli. Mrs.
Molony’s sapphire-blue georgette gown
with diamond clips went with a tarn-
shaped hat in the same shade. Miss
Bourke, who received with Mr. and Mrs.
Molony, sported white satin over a black
velvet skirt, and a close-fitting black
velvet cap.
The Alliance Franyaise entertained
Mrs. James Dyer at morning-tea at the
South Australian. Mrs. Dyer was re-
ceived by president W. W. Goodhart,
hon. sec. Mrs. E. Puddy and Mrs. H. S.
Hudd. Mrs. Puddy presented the guest
with a sheaf of shaded pink gladioli
Mrs. Dyer, looking cool in an ice-blue
ensemble and wide-brimmed oyster-
toned straw hat banded with blue, gave
a description of life in Paris. She has
presented the French club with a col-
lection of melodies for the reed pipes,
and also an edition de luxe of Baudelaire.
TASMANIA.
The Midland Bachelors’ dance at
Powell’s Hall, Campbell Town, was
a very swish affair. Guests came
from both Hobart and Launceston. The
hall was decorated in mauve and silver,
with deep fuchsia fringes on the light
shades, and huge silver and purple
flowers decorating the panelled walls.
Frocking was very smart. Some dancers
sported , bare legs, sandals and lacquered
toenails.
Wet weather has been spoiling most
of our out-of-door parties, but the rain
held off sufficiently to make the Bushy
Park annual show a great success, the
giant gooseberry being only outclassed
by the mammoth pumpkin. Hundreds
of visitors ran up from town by car,
and the countryside turned out in force.
Bushy Park is, a Shoobridge stronghold.
To the jubilee carnival of the Burnie
Athletic Club, his Ex. and Lady Clark
went up by car. The Prime Minister and
Mrs. Lyons were also there, and fine
weather made everybody feel particu-
larly cheerful after persistent rain.
Mary Eileen, only daughter of the Rev.
A. A. and Mrs. Bennett, became Mrs.
G. J. Fysh at St. George’s, Battery Point,
where her father is rector, Bishop Hay
tying the knot. Her frock of heavy white
satin had a long train, and the tulle veil

second son of the E. H. Websters, Sandy
Bay, are ready to receive congratulations
on their engagement. Sheila has just
got home from the Cold Country and
from Scotland.
Mungo MacCallum and his lady have
arrived at Fern tree from Sydney, and are
prepared to take their chance of becom-
ing web-footed with the rest of us in
this extraordinarily wet summer.
Two English guests at G.H. enjoyed

RUTHLESS FLY-SMITER
RELENTLESSLY
By
LESROBINS ON PURSUED.
WE are most annoyed if disturbed in
our dreams, if awakened from
slumber at unearthly hours. Flies,
on the contrary, are not annoyed at all.
Get up at midnight or later and switch
on the light. All the flies asleep on the
picture-frames, the walls, the ceiling
awake with no regret whatever and buzz
joyfully about the room.
If anything in the shape of a bedside
supper should make its appearance, how
gladly, how cheerfully they gather round
to crawl over and share it with us. Could
anything match the zest with which they
promenade in the sugar, the honey and
the jam, or bathe in the milk?
They are sociable insects. They desire
nothing so much as to be the insepar-
able, the inescapable companions of
mankind.
They can always be relied upon to
stick to us no matter at what risk, and
despite the barbaric persecution to which
we most ruthlessly subject them.
What perseverance, what bravery is
theirs!
Do we possess it?
Would we risk being thumped and
squashed by a hand a few hundred times
bigger than ourselves while nonchalantly
consuming our beer?
Would we rush away from it so often
and so marvellously in the nick of time
to avoid being mangled or maimed?
Would we wait patiently for hours for

someone to open gauzed windows or
doors so that we could hurriedly enter
rooms sprayed constantly with noxious
chemicals, to inhale the fumes of which
meant death?
Would we be game enough to go into
lions’ dens, tigers’, gorillas’ or boa-con-
strictors’ cages, bear-pits and alligators
pens merely for the sake of a bite of
stale and even putrescent food?
THOSE who think we would buzz,
probably, when no one is looking and
preen imaginary wings with their hind
feet.
People who loathe insects always seem
to be pestered by them to a greater ex-
tent than more tolerant folk who bear
the blameless (because they don’t know
any better) little creatures no ill-will.
A case in point, and a heart-rending
one, is that of a primary producer who,
domiciled in the back country, which
during the summer months swarms, of
course, with insects of every conceivable
size and shape, decided, as the thousands
he smote daily and nightly, shot with
atomisers and caught on flypapers all
had relatives who made things hotter for
him still, to discontinue his agricultural-
in-between-pest-exterminatory activities
and to move to a city suburb, where, he
fondly imagined, though no one knows
why, life would be less immeasurably
insectivorous.
Was it mere chance or
retribution inexorably exacted
for all the insect car-
nage he had wrought that the
hut he now rented should
previously (he was unaware
of it until after he had moved
in) have been occupied by
the president of the Wild Life
Conservation League?
Only a few weeks, in fact,
had elapsed since that idealis-
tic but futile and insolvent
gentleman had been evicted
by the landlord —a man of
asphaltic and crudely ma-
terialistic tendencies for
non-payment of several
years’ rent.
THE surrounding wild life, which was
in great abundance, was not long in
finding out that, unlike his predecessor,
the newcomer was by no means its great
friend, and no sooner had it made this
depressing discovery than it went into
conference and decided upon a united
endeavor to drive him out.
Ants, instead of a few dozen at a time,
as formerly, mobilised and invaded the
hut, through numerous convenient aper-
tures, in ceaseless processions or streams.
They got into all the insect-hater’s tucker
and bit him in bed.
Moths and silverfish ate holes in his
rugs, blankets, hat and only decent suit
of clothes.
Ticks waited on the ends of trailing
sprays of greenery and clambered upon,
afterwards burrowing into, him as he
brushed past.
Cock and hen roaches swarmed among
his pots and pans and drowned them-
selves in the soup or any other liquids he
omitted to cover.
Bush-spiders spun their webs exactly
five feet from the ground across the track
which connected the hut with the main
road, so that, as their enemy was five
feet six inches high, he would infallibly
suffer the discomfort of getting them in
the face. They then alighted on him and
scrambled in his hair, his eyebrows and
his whiskers.
Tarantulas hid in his boots, in the
pockets of coats and in the legs of
trousers left lying about. They also
raised families in his letter-box.
Daddy-long-legs and other indoor
spiders stopped the clock by building
webs among its works, and at frequent
intervals dropped on him suddenly from
the ceiling.
Nose-dived on the roof.
Mosquitoes became so bold and
numerous that they even battled with the
flies to get a living off him in the day-
time.
Fleas—used to the former tenant’s
caresses no doubt —made scarcely any
attempt to dodge the new one’s clutching
fingers or smiting hand. Blaming neither
their own foolhardiness nor him, they
attributed the thumps, the squeezing and
the pinching (seldom fatal) now inflicted
on them to some sudden, regrettable, but
unavoidable anti-fleatic malignancy affect-
ing what up till then had always been
unimpeded agistment and colonising
facilities.
Grasshoppers in their aerial peregrina-
tions were careful instead of haphazard
about their trajectory, and therefore suc-
ceeded quite often in hitting him in the
eye.
THEN there were the beetles. As soon
as he lit the lamp at night they
entered the hut in hordes through the in-
numerable chinks and crevices incom-
petent construction had rendered inevit-
able. They fell into the frying-pan, they
fell into everything else ; they got down
The horsefly.
the back of his neck; they roamed
through his hair and whiskers; they
searched for him (seldom in vain) deep
down among the bedclothes, and even
found their way into his envelopes, his
gramophone, his chest-of-drawers and his
tobacco.
To read or work was impossible, for,
ably assisted by cicadas, wasps and tree-
crickets, they dashed at the lamp and
endeavored to break the glass.
Opossums waited until they thought
he was asleep, then jumped from the top-
most branches of trees on to the corru-
gated-iron roof, frightening the life out
of him.
As nightjars (a singularly appropriate
name, he was fated to discover) and boo-
books can, of course, being nocturnal in
their habits, see perfectly in the dark,
their realistic imitations of forced and
disastrous landings on that same roof
were obviously deliberate attempts to
startle him.
Another nocturnal bird —the powerful
or eagle owl, which emits an agonising
scream, like that of someone being, in a
particularly fiendish or diabolical manner,
done to death —left the remote mountain
gullies in which it had only been heard
previously for no other reason than to
make the wild-life antagonist’s blood run
cold.
Also, in the dead of night wild ducks
and swans often, instead of rarely, “mis-
took” the roof in the starlight and flicker
of lightning for rippled water and landed
upon or, as it seemed to the antagonist,
nose-dived on to it at seventy-odd miles
an hour.
THESE combined and sustained efforts
of the wild life to get rid of its
oppressor were once again irresistible.
Two weeks in that hut were more than
enough for him. The night before he

BUY—BUILD— PROVIDE WORK
A message to all Australians
who are working and earning
Although employment has steadily increased since 1932
the rate of re-absorption of unemployed during 1935 can be
hastened by wise private and public spending.
Every man or woman put back to work increases the
spending power of the community, stimulates trade and
thus helps to provide further employment.
Every man or woman who provides employment, whether
it be in house repairs or even half a day's gardening, con-
tributes to the return of national prosperity.
Producers, manufacturers and the public generally are
invited to explore all possibilities of expanding their activi-
ties and to consult the Bank of New South Wales on their
financial problems.
The Bank has ample funds available for those who can
profitably employ money in developing production and
trade. Advances against satisfactory security are made at
reduced interest rates. The maximum rate charged on
secured advances is now the lowest on record.

Itchville,
Buzzlehurst,
Antember 13.
| The President,
Wild-life Conservation League.
Dear tick-proof, misguided and fuzzle-
whiskered sir,
I have decided to found a wild-life ex-
termination league. As you might be
faintly interested to know why, swathed
in mosquito-net and poised on islets
formed of jam-tins in a miniature lake of
kerosene, I am indelibly pencilling you
these few lines. My reason then for
founding one old insects' playground and
cafeteria is that I have spent the past
fortnight in this insectarium formerly
occupied by you, etc. [there were about
ten sulphuric pages].
As my decision to become a wild-life
exterminator is irrevocable, any remon-
strative communications from you or
your league will be hurled into the dust-
bin unread.—Yours malevolently,
Foundation President,
Wild-life Extermination League.
The only place, he now told himself,
where a respite from wild life, man-eat-
ing insects in
particular, might
con ceivably be
enjoyed was far
out upon the
heaving bosom of
the ocean. After
he had found,
therefore, among
the shipping ad-
vertisements the
longest non-stop
voyage a person
who was not ex-
j ceedingly wealthy
could afford to
take, he booked
his passage imme-
-1 diately.
i To his annoy-
j ance, chagrin and
amazement, however, one sultry day
when the steamer conveying him to the
other side of the world was proceeding
I unhindered and tranquilly along, no land
as yet being visible . (the nearest was
Senegambia), she was all at once over-
whelmed by a dense cloud of flies.
They had found out in some mys-
terious, probably occult, way, he per-
haps not inaccurately surmised, that a
deadly enemy of theirs was on board, and
had come out to punish him.
The whole ship was soon alive and
crawling with the persistent, loathsome
and vicious little brutes, and it was upon
the insect-hater who had slaughtered so
many of their distant relatives in his own
country that they vented their wrath.
Attacked by flies.
The combined buzzing of these swarm-
ing myriads reminded the maddened
traveller of a disturbed apiary, and he
noticed, between bites, that horse- or
stable-flies were more in evidence than
any even remotely aristocratic species.
He noticed as well that a large, aggres-
sive, disreputable looking and particularly
fierce red kind, which even bit the stable-
flies and any others that happened to get
in its way, a fly with strongly marked
communistic tendencies and a buzz, he
avers, remarkably like “The Red Flag”
played on a tooth-comb, was also much
in evidence.
Some few pacifist, consistently vege-
tarian and inoffensive insects, mere camp-
followers, as it were, of the punitive ex-
pedition, flew about the ship as well and
settled on the hatch-coamings and the
decks occasionally.
One that didn’t settle —an aerial view of
such an overwhelmingly plebeian as-
semblage doubtless sufficed—was a large
yellow butterfly. Perhaps because their
intelligence is several sizes smaller than
their wings, butterflies really do seem
prone to develop a superiority complex.
After fluttering round for just a little
while it set off at top speed for the shore.
The steamer
was not an ocean
greyhound evi-
dently, for the
president of the
W.L.E.L. said
that when it
reached port
some hours later
and the anchor
was thrown over-
board, knocking
a somnambulistic
fish’s brains out,
he saw the yellow
butterfly again. It
was browsing on
some yellow
flowers in the
qua rantine en-
closure.
As a result of the innumerable bites
and stings he received the president de-
veloped uncontrollable insectivorous ten-
dencies, and is at present an outpatient
of one of our leading museums, where
he is undergoing treatment that it is
hoped will correct his tendency to follow
garbagemen about and the other insani-
tary changes that have taken place in his
habits and nature. If the entomologists
are, however, unsuccessful in this en-
deavor, the Board of Health, assisted by
manufacturers of the latest and most
potent disinfectants, feet-entanglement
compounds and spray-gun mixtures, will,
with unbridled enthusiasm and the appro-
bation of the Master in Lunacy, take
such action as, in the public interest, is
deemed expedient.
The Old Swordsman.
| We were always picking quarrels in my youth—
Oh, on the nicest points . . . truth and half-
\ truth,
Whim or opinion. Otherwise, boy, you were
naught,
Just naught, in any hero’s eyes . . .
Any lean hero, with his insolent blade,
His imitation smile, the scar that made
' His legend, a haughty whiteness in the brown
Of his hard face: boy after boy put down
| Over spilt Rhenish wine, a bodice-lace . . .
By God, I think we did it by the grace
Of devils, and not of God. Now that I’m old—
I (Pile on the logs—the very shadows seem cold)
I don’t much like to see those stammering lips
Of Youth: proud to its fingertips,
Not willing to back down; “Sir, she’s a saint,
Milady.” Well, that won’t help you . . .
Riposte and feint,
A thousand deft tricks of the fencing-
school . . .
Always the hard eyes—laughing, quarrelsome,
cool.
Boy, I was of their best.
A little while at Court, ’twas manifest
One had to be a swordsman, or admit
Deficiencies no quietude or wit
Quite covered. Well, I learned their rules.
A little, and I grew dangerous to fools . . .
A little, and I went mincing my way to
trouble . . .
I’ve seen the dark blood bubble
Down the white shirt of one as young as
you . . .
Tall, he was, staunch, eyes blue,
And slightly drunk. I killed hin+. Oh, no
crime . . .
Just an affair of honor. Well, that morning,
Unshaven, drunk, I stared in my looking-glass,
Drew out the flexible steel for the last time . . .
Feint and riposte and pass . . .
There without seconds, without one word of
warning,
I killed the Hero, too.
You see the empty scabbard at my side?
I’ve worn it ever since. My name for it is Pride.

ROBIN HYDE.
The Thin House .
There is a tall thin house beside a road,
A road wherein the little paths are lost
Like rivulets in rivers, and here come
The children with their eager seeking eyes;
For this thin house has ever-open doors,
One leading in, one out; it has a wall
Of crocus-yellow and geranium-pink,
And on the pink wall is the yellow crane
That flew there from a Chinese fairy tale;
And on the pink wall is a forest scene,
A frieze of huntsmen with the hawk on wrist,
A dado of fair ladies in plumed hats
And velvet riding-skirts that sweep the ground,
And spotted hounds with tendril-waving tails.
And near the pointed roof of brick-red tiles
A sky-blue pigeon-cote casts grey-blue birds
To carry magic to the wide world’s end.
Against the pink wall Jack’s stout beanstalk
grows,
And inside that thin house you hear the sound
Of giants gobbling porridge, or a cry
From that poor magic harp that snapped a
string,
Weeping because some heart lost Fairyland.
The children romp across the summer grass,
Guided by harnessed wings of butterflies
Joined by the silver strands of spiderwebs —
Children with blue eyes; elfin dark, with
brown —
To mount the smooth mosaic of the steps
And enter without knocking to this house,
The never-quiet house where the bees come
Because they know that here is happiness.
The children come in winter wrapped in furs
On sledges drawn by reindeer through the snow,
Till the crisp air is full of tinkling bells.
From all the earth the laughing children come,
But when they pass out by the other door
They are no longer children . . . Man and
Maid
Look doubtfully into each other’s eyes
And see fresh flowers to pluck—and fear a
thorn . . .
Oh! Never go they forth from the thin house
With half the trust with which they entered
there!

SAYS Dr. D. Jacobsen - noted medical authority
It is definitely established that
modern foods do not stimulate the
bowel muscles to sufficient action.
Consequently, though your habits
be regular, particles of food-waste
are left in the folds and crevices of
the intestine. These fragments of
food-waste remain in the colon
day after day sometimes for
weeks or months—decaying and
breeding germs and poisons which
enter the blood-stream and pro-
duce the condition known as Self-
poisoning or “ Autoxima,” from
which nine out of ten suffer.
WHAT DOCTORS SAY
Medical opinion now regards Self-
poisoning as one of the principal
causes of ill-health. Rheumatism,
Sciatica, Neuritis, Headaches, In-
digestion, Constipation, Bladder
Ailments, Depression, Weakness,
Catarrh, Eczema, Skin Troubles
and a host of minor aches and
pains can now be traced to this in-
sidious enemy of health.

years ago ? Then get rid of Self-
poisoning. Drink Coloseptic in hot
water every morning. Coloseptic
is a tonic that cleanses the en-
crusted waste from the intestines
without griping or inconvenience.
It strengthens intestinal muscles
so that your bowels function nat-
urally and regularly. It tones up
the whole digestive tract. Colo-
septic cleans the blood-stream of
poisonous acids and wastes by
exerting a powerful action upon
the kidneys. It stimulates Nature’s
other great eliminatory organs
the pores of the skin and the re-
spiratory tract. Coloseptic gives
you the complete internal clean-
ness which is the first step to per-
fect health. It prevents germs and
toxins from generating and being
absorbed.

My Political
Life
By W. A. HOLMAN
ANOTHER
THREAT TO THE
MAJORITY
Our earliest
discovery after
crossing this first
hurdle was that
we had tem-
porarily lost one
of our 45 supporters. Macdonell, con-
fined to his bed in Melbourne all through
these changes, had not attended any sit-
ting of the brief session suddenly closed
by the Lieut.-Governor’s prorogation.
Under the Standing Orders, if a member
is absent from the House through a
whole session, however brief, and has not
obtained leave of absence, his seat auto-
matically becomes vacant. Macdonell
had been paired while he was ill, and
no one had realised his non-attendance
until the House reassembled.
A by-election had to be held, but the
Opposition, out of regard for my ailing
colleague, allowed it to go uncontested
in spite of the heated feeling prevailing.
Macdonell was re-elected, and leave of
absence was immediately applied for and
granted and a fresh pair arranged.
An accident which put another of our
members out of action for a long time
threatened at first to have much more
serious immediate consequences. Meehan,
member for the Darling, had the mis-
fortune to slip on the stairs at Parlia-
ment House and fall over the precari-
ously low balustrading which at that
time protected them, sustaining serious
internal injuries. He was carried to
Sydney Hospital, where he lay for many
weeks, incapable of moving, his ultimate
recovery being by no means certain.
This brought our tally of able-bodied
supporters who could be present in the
flesh when the division bell rang down
to 43. The enemy’s number was still 44.
This state of things subjected the
Opposition to a temptation to which I
did not think it fair to leave it ex-
posed for any undue time. Our Whip
accordingly secured a pair for Meehan
within an hour or two of hearing of the
accident, and before the members of the
Opposition had had time to meet and
evolve ideas.
Of course, they could not have voted
their full strength of 44 without calling
off the pair with Macdonell; but feel-
ing was running exceedingly high just
then, and very shortly events fully justi-
fied this precaution.
“ALL PAIRS OFF-
I have the live-
Hest recollection
of the Minister
for Lands,
Beeby, coming in to see me at the Treas-
ury to report the next development. A
section of the Opposition had determined
to call off all pairs. In view of the
strained relations existing, these Opposi-
tionists would refuse consideration to our
two absentee,, members. They would
move a vote of censure and have done
with us.
In the way in which all things leak out,
this had leaked out from their camp and
got to Beeby’s ears, and he lost no time
in warning me.
His opinion was that this was the end
of us. We had survived everything else,
but we should not survive this.
It was a trying moment. We could
not deny that we had availed ourselves
of our technical rights to the uttermost
in the election of the Speaker, and in
the Opposition camp there were doubt-
less many who were prepared to justify
themselves on that ground in the serious
breach of faith which they were now
contemplating.
Our business was not to complain of
the action contemplated but to defeat it.
I sent for the representatives of the
afternoon papers and told them the story
I had just heard. I told them I found
it impossible to believe the members
of the Opposition could manifest the
savage indifference to Parliamentary
standards which would be involved in
breaking pairs with two ailing members
of the House. I went on to say that if
such a thing were contemplated it would
fail. I had, I said, had an assurance
from Meehan that if his pair were called
off he would have his bed moved into a
room in the House alongside the Cham-
ber from which he could take part in
the division. The evening press, moved
to the quick by these further surprises,
gave every possible publicity to them and
to Meehan’s romantic proposal.
MEEHAN TO
THE RESCUE
As a matter of
fact, this moving
demonstration of
party loyalty was
my own.
I had sent a messenger to suggest it
to Meehan and to obtain for it his
authority, which that gallant spirit gave
without a moment’s hesitation, but I re-
presented the idea to the press, by a per-
missible poetic license, as emanating
from the burning indignation which' an
ardent nature like Meehan’s would natur-
ally feel at the degrading baseness of the
suggested Opposition tactics.
When the statement appeared an hour
or so later it created an intense sensation,
and led to what I imagined would be its
result —an indignant denial by the
Opposition leaders of any idea of
such a step.
I do not suppose that the front-rank
Oppositionists would have agreed to it in
any circumstances, but the announcement
that even if they did it would be futile
called off the pressure to which' they were
subjected by some of their followers.
Meehan—an earnest spirit from the
backblocks —was bitterly disappointed at
the too complete success of this manoeuvre
and greatly regretted not having been led
in like another Chatham, to save his
country in a hospital cot. I pointed out
to him, by way of consolation, that he
had had the glory of having made his
offer.
ILLNESS OF
DONALD
MACDONELL
Among all these
cares I had man-
aged to find time
before the meet-
ing of the House
for the distress-
ing task of running over to Melbourne to
visit our bedridden comrade Donald
Macdonell. Shortly after the January
conference he had gone over to Mel-
bourne on some business connected with
the Shearers’ Union, of which he was still
the general secretary. There he had been
smitten down with illness, rapidly de-
veloping most alarming symptoms.
Dr. Nash, M.L.C., was kind enough
to accompany me and confer with the
Melbourne medical men in attendance.
The last report we had had from
these gentlemen had suggested a renewed
possibility of recovery.
An operation had been performed
without success (though the patient had
not been informed of this), but there had
been changes in his condition indicating
apparently that the growth detected had
not been so malignant as was at first
feared. The further examinations now
made, however, definitely ended hope.

with no serious expectation of ever see-
ing him in life again.
DEATH OF
CARDINAL
MORAN
With the death
of Card in a 1
Moran a sweep-
ing change in the
attitude of the
Irish section to-
wards our party began.
His successor, Archbishop Kelly, whose
saintly life was passed in unworldly sim-
plicity, was a churchman of an entirely
different stamp. He made no attempt to
control the political movements of his
flock, and a perplexed party leader who
called in upon him was much more likely
to get wholesome counsel as to the state
of his soul and the necessity for a careful
searching of his conscience than helpful
suggestions as to the best way out of a
purely mundane difficulty.
Still, for some time matters remained
unchanged. The impetus given things
by the late Cardinal had swept some-
thing like nine-tenths of his congregation
into our camp, and the kindness and
frankness of the Archbishop kept the
relations between us and them on the
most cordial footing.
THE OPPOSITION
OPPOSES
Proceedings in
Parliament now
suffered a sea
change. Conten-
tious business on our part was for
the present at an end by our compact
with Willis. But the Opposition brought
forth plenty of its own. The Opposition
of that year was a most formidable fight-
ing body, and hardly an hour went by
without some new and ingenious attack
upon the Speaker materialising. Dissents
from his rulings, legal proceedings,
motions of privilege, abounded. Mem-
bers were suddenly brought face to face
with the most recondite principles of the
Constitution, and nine-tenths of the As-
sembly’s energies were turned towards
finding and quoting precedents, demon-
strating propositions of pure law, touch-
ing the Speaker’s powers.
SPEAKER WILLIS
Willis turned
out to be quite a
heaven- born
Speaker. He dis-
played an amazing familiarity with the
intricacies of Parliamentary . practice,
which swiftly carried even the old hands
out of their depth, and a firmness which
had been entirely lacking in our gover-
nance during the whole of the genial days
of McCourt.
Willis was beset during the first few
weeks by concerted and systematised dis-
order, carried on by a whole party and
applauded by practically the whole Press.
Faced by such a tornado of antagonisms,
reinforced by the bitter personal feeling
expressed towards him, Willis, far from
quailing, availed himself of his legal
powers with the utmost sang-froid, used
each weapon in his armory in turn with
entirely unexpected dexterity, kept the
whip-hand of everybody and did a good
deal in passing to improve the tone and
temper of the House. He ruled with a
rod of iron, but he did rule, and when
the storm and whirlwind were let loose
against him by his enemies he rode them
out with remarkable displays of courage
and skill.
Nothing annoyed the more obstrep-
erous members of our lax and always
disorderly Assembly so much as the
machine-like imperturbability with which
the new Speaker applied long-forgotten
elementary principles. He would endure
for a period with a godlike calm some
fierce philippic thundered against him-
self from the Opposition benches. Sud-
denly he would interpose: “The honor-
able member has used that argument
several times before.” The honorable
member had, and in more and more
frightfully unparliamentary language each
time. “I warn the honorable member
that he is becoming guilty of tedious
repetition,” he would go on. The repeti-
tion was obvious enough, but it was only
by a flight of judicial fancy that it could
be called tedious.
In the golden age of McCourt we were
accustomed, if the Speaker ever reached
this stage with us, to make a spirited ex-
postulation. That jovial spirit allowed a
good deal of “talking back,” and used
to say, in fact, that he profited by it.
Willis was made of sterner stuff. When
the member thus admonished started off
with the time-honored formula, “What,
Mr. Speaker, am I not allowed to”
whatever it was, he got a reply like an
avalanche. “The honorable member is
a second time out of order in disputing
the Speaker’s ruling. If the honorable
member offends a third timfe I shall have
him removed from the Chamber.” And
sure enough he did. These methods had
a remarkable effect. Ours was a turbu-
lent body at the best, and the Opposition
numbered in its ranks many men of great
strength of character, but Willis quelled
us like a wild-beast tamer.
A MASTER OF
PROCEDURE
Willis was
often called on
to give some very
difficult rulings.
The legal minds of the Opposition were
constantly exercised to set traps for the
new Speaker. The foundations of Par-
liamentary authority were searched as
they had never been before in my experi-
ence. He was called upon to rule sud-
denly and under exacting conditions on
some of the most difficult questions I
have ever seen raised, knowing, too, that
he was working in an atmosphere of
continuous press hostility, and that a mis-
take would have been seized on with
great joy in Gath and Ascalon.
Such conditions do not conduce to
level and continuous thinking. Never-
theless, I do not know of any occasion
where he made a serious error in his
rulings. He knew the rules as no one
else did. The Standing Orders had de-
generated into a legend in the easy-going
period of his predecessor, and their
sudden recrudescence, bristling at every
point, and enforced with all the terrors
of his presidential authority, was man-
aged in such a fashion that the best men
amongst us were unable to find fault
effectively with the manner of its doing.
He did make one serious mistake, as I
shall relate, but this was not over any
matter arising on the floor of the House,
and the error there was one of tactics
and not of law.
THE MEMBER
FOR BEGA
On one occa-
sion, and only
one, the House
got seriously out
of hand.
The Speaker had pulled up Wood, the
deputy-leader of the Opposition, with
somewhat unnecessary sharpness. Wood
had on other occasions been highly offen-
sive to the Speaker, but on this occasion,
in the judgment of many, he had not ex-
ceeded, except technically, and the
Speaker might perhaps have been well
advised to let the matter pass.
On this, of course, I can offer no judg-
ment —the Speaker may have had good
reasons for determining to make an
example of him. Be that as it may, on
this occasion Wood resisted expulsion
physically. When the fatal words “Ser-
geant, remove the honorable member”
were spoken, he was assisted by several
other members of the Opposition (who
held him in his seat by main force in
imitation of a celebrated English pre-
cedent) to defy the utmost efforts of the
Sergeant-at-Arms and the messengers.
Excitement boiled over in a moment.
A rapidly increasing mob struggled
around Wood’s seat, and our younger
men were beginning to throw themselves
into the fray.
For the first and only time during my
membership of the House I saw a clear
prospect of a sitting terminating in a free
fight.
In this emergency Willis lost not one
whit of his Olympian placidity.
“I shall leave the Chair for 10 minutes.”
he announced—and did so.
The fever subsided as if by magic. At
the end of the 10 minutes the bells were
rung, members reassembled, Wood sat
defiantly in his disputed seat, and the
electricity again tingled in every nerve
of everybody.
“I call,” said the Speaker, “on the
honorable member for Bega to leave the
Chamber.”
“I shall not go, sir,” said Wood.
“Police,” said Mr. Speaker, “remove
the honorable member.”
At the word, a file of constabulary,
headed by the House sergeant —a friendly
and familiar figure in our precincts—de-
bouched from behind the Chair and
marched straight upon the devoted states-
man who had been indicated as their
victim. They looked, as Thrower said
afterwards, exactly as if they had come
out of “The Pirates of Penzance.”
Wood prudently recognised the pres-
ence of superior force, and walked out
in companionable converse with the
police officers. The episode ended with-
out another feather being ruffled, and
the Speaker, with iron self-possession
went on calmly with the Order of the
Day.
RETURN OF
PREMIER
McGOWEN
In September,
McGowen was
welcomed with
heartfelt enthu-
siasm on his re-
turn from his
journey abroad. His absence had really
been exceedingly brief. He had gone to
the centre of the Empire and returned
within five and a half months. But they
had been months crowded with incidents,
any of which might have been a disaster!
He found on his return Neilsen gone
from the Cabinet and Macdonell in-
capacitated. He found, however, a good
deal to his astonishment, the Ministry in
good fettle and the party majority of
two, though lost for the moment, appar-
ently on the high road to restoration. I
handed over the reins to him with im-
mense relief, and with a feeling that I
had emerged from a period of great
tribulation.

By the path, sedate and slow,
To gaze upon the vale below.

Climbing at a breakneck pace.

Mirpil
Skin Balm
Ideal for

Mirpil is a soothing and cooling lotion
scientifically prepared to correct chafed
skin, sunburn, windburn, sore and tired
feet. Will keep the skin soft and smooth.
Dries in a few minutes without leaving any
greasy after-effect.
Windburn and Sunburn.— When
the skin is burned by either wind or sun,
or both, one or more liberal applications
of Mirpil will bring relief. If the skin •is
too tender to bear being touched by hand,
lay a clean linen or cotton cloth, satu-
rated with the Balm, over the affected
part,
Mosquitoes and Sandflies.— Mir-
pil smeared on face and hands at night
will keep mosquitoes away. It also soothes
mosquito and sandfly bites.
Rough Hands. Besides frequently
having them in water, there are certain
other classes of work in the home, factory,
garden and elsewhere which roughen the
hands of both women and men. The
amount of discomfort thus caused it is
unnecessary to describe. Those who are
affected know it only too well. When
such a condition arises a few applications
of Mirpil will be found to restore the
natural softness.
To Mothers. Baby has to be bathed
once or more each day, and between
times there is constant washing of clothes,
which tends to chapped hands. There is
no reason why a mother should not take
care of herself, as well as the baby. Re-
member that broken skin provides easy
access for germs, and it is of the greatest
importance that the hands be kept healthy
and free from any eruptions that might
infect the baby, either through contact
or per medium of its food. Rub Mirpil
on the hands frequently, and results will
be found to more than compensate for
this precaution.
Chafed Skin . In cases of chafed
skin Mirpil will prove an efficient emol-
lient.
Sore and Tired Feet.—A pp 1 y
Mirpil to the soles of your feet when sore
and tired. The relief is wonderful.
After Shaving. — A small quantity of
Mirpil rubbed on the face after shaving
will be found soothing.
Before Applying Powder, always
rub Mirpil into the skin until dry. The
cleansing and cooling actions of this pre-
paration will enhance the comfort which
powder provides.
