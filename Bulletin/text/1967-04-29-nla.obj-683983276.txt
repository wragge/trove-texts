WINE
The wine growers story of favoured vintages.
Coonawarra Estate
’66 Riesling
The success of the Rhine
Riesling vines planted at
Coonawarra Estate is shown
by this wine. Bottled within
six months of vintage, the ’66
Riesling has retained fully
the fresh, slightly ‘spritzig’
Riesling character.
Coonawarra Estate
’63 Hermitage
The ripening period of 1963
at Coonawarra was
unusually humid, which
seems to have added
subtlety to the wine, giving
it greater delicacy, yet
with a deeply satisfying full
flavour. It may well prove
to be the best Australian
Hermitage ever.
Coonawarra Estate
’62 Cabernet
Following on the 1960
Vintage, (the 1961 Vintage
was a total loss at Coona-
warra Estate) the 1962 is a
bigger wine in which the
oak-maturation and
Cabernet Sauvignon
character form a well
balanced soft symphony of
flavour.
Modbury Estate
’65 Moselle
Riesling grapes vintaged
early in March result in a
light, delicate wine with all
the best characteristics of a
true Moselle. An undertone
of soft fruitiness adds an
intriguing characteristic
which will appeal to those
who prefer a crisp, not too
dry, white wine.
Ovens Valley
’62 Burgundy
A fine, big Northern
Victorian wine grown from
Shiraz, pressed and matured
in oak for three years. Now,
after bottle-ageing, this soft,
smooth Burgundy is being
released from Wynns. It is a
superb example of the big
wines produced in this area.
Modbury Estate
’65 White Burgundy
Semillion grapes, grown on
gently-contoured Northern
slopes, and expert care have
produced this full, rich
White Burgundy. The ap-
pealing fragrance and flavour
of this vintage earns it pride
of place in any cellar.

BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
The unending
wars of the
planesmen
AS YOU KNOW, our two great air-
lines operate in a system of splendid
togetherness. Not only do they operate
flights together, here in Melbourne
they actually live together. They are
both in Franklin Street, and Mr.
Ryland and Mr. Ansett can virtually
wave to each other out their windows.
However, to gain full value from
this Tweedledum-Tweedledee arrange-
ment it is rewarding to observe how
the airlines gain new aircraft. Not
only does our benevolent Government
organise that they must operate the
same aircraft, it appears that they must
also arrive on the same day.
Let’s go back to October, 1964, to
T-Bay and the arrival of the Boeing
727 jets. Originally the idea was that
one 727 should go to Sydney and the
other to Melbourne, but no, both air-
lines wanted to kick off their publicity
in Melbourne. Then there was the
awful problem as to which aircraft
should actually land first. Like rival
cricket captains, they decided to toss.
Reg Ansett won the toss and decided
to bat.
It was a difficult time for us here
in Melbourne. Invitations arrived from
both companies to attend the arrival
at the same time on Friday afternoon.
One couldn’t accept both. So here once
and for all loyalties were settled. “Were
you for Reg or were you for TAA?”
Then the real manoeuvring began.
Ansett-ANA, according to the toss, was
the first to land, then immediately after
in came TAA. TAA took their 727 into
a hangar, had speeches, Lady Chippin-
dall smashed a bottle of champagne
across its bows, and named it the
James Cook. Reg Ansett didn’t waste
time with this sentimental nonsense of
naming aircraft; immediately he had
his up in the air giving trips to news-
paper and TV men.
The next day was interesting. Four
months before, TAA had planned a
two-day trip around Australia for news-
papermen. Reg Ansett waited until the
TAA invitations were out, then planned
a trip for his 727 all around Australia
in one day. He was first into every
capital except Adelaide and Canberra.
The situation was similar once again
last week. This was the day of the
arrival of the first DC9s. By unremark-
able coincidence, both airlines were
receiving identical aircraft and both
were arriving together. The cricket
captains tossed again, and this time
TAA won the toss and decided to bat.
The arrival time for both was 3.45
p.m. on the Thursday afternoon. TAA
was out there with special invitations
offering drinks, savories, and such.
Ansett-ANA was there also offering
drinks and what not. The only thing
to do was to hurry back and forth
and have scotches with both, so as
not to offend.
The TAA DC9 landed precisely on
time at 3.45 p.m. and meanwhile the
Ansett-ANA DC9 was already in the
circuit area, and it wasted no time
whatever getting down to the ground.
We pulled out our stopwatches and
timed the delay at two minutes 15
seconds.
A TAA PR gentleman handed out
packets of DC9 data complete with
photographs. An Ansett-ANA PR
gentleman handed out packets of DC9
data complete with photographs. It
was comforting to note that they were
precisely the same size.
However, one couldn’t help but feel
that Mr. Ansett won the planesman-
ship battle just as he did in 1964. This
was the TAA tarmac area, but long
“It's a beautiful day here at Essen-
don, runway's fast and Ansett’s lost the
toss.”

beforehand he booked up tarmac space
right alongside. He had a DC3, a
DC4, and a DC6B, all up for sale.
So he had these sprucely polished and
painted and put on display. So that
when his new DC9 came in he had the
perfect line-up, DC3, DC6, DC6B,
and DC9. Admittedly it looked like
“Honest Reg’s Used Car Lot,” but
the idea- wasn’t wasted on aviation
writers who wanted an historic picture.
From here on all was action to get
the DC9s ready for a 7 o’clock start
on Monday morning. Both airlines had
to go through a little pantomime with
DCA. They had to be tested for fire
drill. That is, each aircraft had to be
filled with passengers at the “maxi-
mum tourist configuration” (get on to
that word “configuration.” It’s IN at
the moment.) Then they had to be
timed out through the emergency
exits; TAA did theirs by daylight and
Ansett-ANA by dark.
However, leaving their invitations to
less than 40 hours beforehand, Ansett-
ANA swung in a special Press flight for
the Sunday morning, a champagne
Press breakfast aloft. Your correspond-
ent is, regrettably, easily seduced by
champagne (Great Western) at break-
fast and he accepted.
The Ansett-ANA PR people are full
of bright ideas. They picked a name,
Douglas, at random out of the tele-
phone book and they got Mr. W. G.
Douglas, a retired headmaster of Glen
Iris, who, bless his heart, had three
children and nine grandchildren. They
all came out to appear in front of the
TV cameras. Mr. Douglas, what’s more,
was bedecked in a Douglas tartan tie.
Now as for the aircraft itself, but for
one less engine, it is almost exactly the
same as the 727. No doubt all sorts of
other interesting things go on under
the bonnet, but the main difference is
that it has an entrance straight up under
the tail, and as one of my friends used
to say of the Convair: “I always found
that an embarrassing experience.”
The Ansett-ANA DC9 has interior
colors of a somewhat brilliant orange
with Aboriginal motifs. Up front, if it’s
possible, it is even quieter than the 727.
Down aft because of only two engines
you can sit farther back; indeed you
can sit right between the two engines,
and here it is downright noisy. If you
are going tourist make sure they don’t
put you in the rear seats.
There was one more good PR line.
Captain Peter Gibbes, Operations Man-
ager for Ansett-ANA, was aboard and
the PR men had confirmation from
Douglas that he was the only pilot in
the world who had flown the DC2,
DC3, DC4, DCS, DG6, DC6B, DC7,
DCB, and DC9.
On Monday TAA fought back with
Mr. Guy Rex, of Hobart. He was a
passenger who had flown as a passenger'
in the DC2, DC3, DC4, DCS, DC6,
DG6B, DC7, DCB, and DC9. They flew
him over to Melbourne on the regular
aircraft and back home that afternoon
by DC9. But, really, it was too late.
The PR battle was over.

There’s only one way to avoid it. Get off the plane in time. Fortunately,
between Sydney and Hong Kong, being specialists in The East, we offer 65
different places to do just that. Starting with Manila. And ending up with
Zamboanga. Only one problem. It isn’t that easy
to get off. Because we fly with everything from
French pastry to classical music on the way. We
figure we’ve got you hooked once you get to Manila.
Because Hong Kong is only $4O away. Although
$9.65 to Baguio, return, is pretty enticing, too!

together in fluid motion — can only be
delivered by a perfect golf grip. The
grip is the single most important factor
in getting the ball where you want it
to go.
So the only way to cut 4,5, or even 6
strokes off your game is to develop the
perfect grip and use it every time you
play.
NOW POSSIBLE FOR YOU
Now, $3.50 (or $6.00 for 2) will buy you
a scientifically designed grip-formulating
device called "Grip-O-Matic”. The “Grip-
O-Matic” will educate your fingers and
hands into the muscle mechanics of the
perfect grip.
Your pro. can show you this grip
start you off the right way. It’s up to
you to keep it that way. Now, the
"Grip-O-Matic” is the teacher that tells
you when your grip is right, because
you can feel when it's wrong.
APPROVED BY PROS. AND BEGINNERS—
BECAUSE GUESSWORK IS ELIMINATED!
Everybody is excited! "Grip-O-Matics”
solid rubber construction fully moulds
your hands, fingers to the classic grip
to give you greater distance, unfailing
accuracy on every shot.
Regular practice now easy in your home,
the office, between shots, on practice
fairways (“Grip-O-Matic” can easily be
fitted to a practice club).
Very soon, the ''Grip-O-Matic” will have
trained your hands to automatically
apply the perfect grip every time you
select a club.
Then your score comes down —4, 5,
even 6 strokes. (If you only save a
ball a round, you’ll cover the low cost
of “Grip-O-Matic" in a few weeks.)
But your score will come down. “Grip-
O-Matic”—designed by a pro. —has
proved itself. Within 10 days you’ll
prove it, too, or your money back!

ON THE
MARGIN
When everybody's
an executive, then
no one's anybody
BY ROSS CAMPBELL
SOME MARGINAL farm land on the
western outskirts of Sydney was sub-
divided not long ago and offered for
sale. As a student of literature as well
as real estate, I knew this land to be
roughly, in the region that forms the
background of the recent novels of
Patrick White. It was not far from
Barranugli and Mungundribble, in the
general direction of Sarsaparilla, al-
though being less developed it lacked
the physical and cultural amenities of
those centres.
It hardly seemed a locality likely ro
become the mecca of Sydney’s smart
set. I was therefore surprised to see
the subdivision described in advertise-
ments as “the new young executive
district.”
My first impulse was to regard the
statement with scepticism, as an
example of the fantasy-weaving asso-
ciated with the sale of subdivided land.
These fancies are usually bodied forth
in pictures by artists with a talent for
foreshortening, so that a view of holi-
day sites 80 miles up the coast shows
the Sydney Harbor Bridge peeping
over a nearby hill. Beaches near sub-
divisions are adorned by pretty girls in
exiguous bathing togs, while enormous
fish swim in the adjacent waters, wait-
ing to be caught.
I was inclined to class the young
executives of the Outer Barranugli
district with these fish, as creatures of
subdivision mythology. The suggestion
of dynamic fellows in well-cut three-
button suits, striding along among the
seedy residents portrayed by Mr.
White, was too improbable to swallow.
The advertisers assumed that the
reported presence of young executives
would make the district more attrac-
tive, but personally I did not feel this
was so. From what I had heard of
them, on TV and elsewhere, young
executives were always “up-and-com-
ing.” To me up-and-comingness is’not
a particularly lovable quality.
But the more I thought about it, the
more I realised I was in a state of
confusion as to who and what execu-
tives were. Years ago it used to be clear
enough - an executive was somebody
who gave orders to other people. He
had authority, and you could often pick
him out because he wore a black hom-
burg hat. But in recent times the title
has been conferred on a far wider range

of persons and claimed by them. I
read an interview with a girl of 20,
working in a dress shop, who described
herself as a “fashion executive.”
Nearly all men who wear shirts must
be presumed to be executives, because
nearly all shirts are of the executive
type. The same goes for men who smoke
cigarettes and use preparations to stick
their hair down. They are all up-and-
coming young executives. The business
world is getting to be like an army of
officers with no private soldiers, or a
tribe of chiefs with no Indians.
The explosion of executives is an
instance of the tendency which I
noted in a previous article to give
people nicer names than they used to
have. The old have become senior
citizens and the poor have become the
lower-income groups. So it is natural
enough that almost everybody who has
a job should be an executive.
Taking the word in this broad, demo-
cratic sense, the statement that a sub-
division in the hinterland of Barranugli
is “the new young executive district”
becomes less pretentious than it seemed.
It means simply that young people
who work for a living have begun to
make their homes there.
These executives are no doubt plain,
decent folk who do not give them-
selves airs. They are not likely to
behave in a patronising way to older
residents of the kind depicted by Pat-
rick White. In fact, a number of Mr.
White’s characters are themselves
executives. Misanthropic Waldo Brown,
of The Solid Mandala, who at one
time worked in the Sydney Municipal
Library, could be described correctly
as a retired library executive.
The executive explosion does raise
a new problem: how should one refer
to a person who really gives orders
and makes decisions? How does one
distinguish him from all the other
executives? For want of a better term,
it may be necessary to fall back on
the old practice of calling him “the
boss.” In appearance the genuine big-
shot is not usually hard to pick out.
He is a rumpled-looking man who
does not wear neat, executive-type
clothes. He doesn’t have to.
Another point to be borne in mind
is that the word “executive,” having
already lost caste, may slide further
down the status scale. This tends to
happen in the English language (e.g.
“idiot,” “lust,” “knave,” and “silly,”
which all once had more respectable
meanings). I foresee a time when we
shall hear remarks like: “Poor Harry
is the dull one of the family. He’s just
an executive.”

MARION RAYMOND’S
COOKBOOK
Why do so
many cooks
chicken out?
WHEN, MANY years ago, after read-
ing an abundance of Hemingway we
finally found ourselves on our way to
Madrid, we occupied ourselves on the
journey by attempting to learn the
language from one of those books of
handy little sentences. While I was
busy going through terms for butter,
bread, goat, and various fishes, my
husband was concentrating on sen-
tences like: “No tengo bastante dinero
para pagar la quenta.” (“Haven’t got
enough money to pay the bill.”)
After settling into our hotel we took
ourselves off to one of the restaurants
in that beautiful city, which is so
crammed with good restaurants that
it’s hard to decide which is the best.
Here we found ourselves confronted
with an enormous menu in Spanish.
While the camarero became increas-
ingly impatient all the culinary terms
seemed to vanish from my memory.
As tue waiter flicked his napkin,
miraculously I recognised the word
polio. Smiling brightly I pointed to
the chicken dish with the longest
explanation of all. When it arrived,
swimming in a very dark sauce, my
stomach sank. Here we were confronted
with chicken cooked in chocolate
sauce! You may think it revolting, as
I did, but it was delicious.
There are, in fact, so many interest-
ing chicken dishes that I am constantly
amazed how many people (and res-
taurants) still serve chicken dressed
only in the plainest garb. Chicken,
once the luxury of any table, is now
almost cheaper than meat. You can
buy it by size, you can buy it by
weight. You can buy the innards, mixed
or separated; all make good meals,
quickly and cheaply.
A Coq au Vin may sound compli-
cated but it’s the easiest thing in
the world to cook, and it tastes and
looks sumptuous.
For four persons you need a roasting
chicken weighing between 2| and 3Jlb.
Cut into four pieces. In an earthenware
casserole melt 2 tablespoons of butter,
add |lb. of cubed salt pork, and simmer
until soft.
Blanch four small white onions, dry
them and add to the casserole. Add
the chicken, season with cooking salt
and ground pepper. Add of quar-
tered mushrooms, stir and brown the

Some people think black is for the birds.
But if we thought about it that way, your tyres might
be more expensive, or less reliable.
You see, we make carbon black. And right now we’re
introducing our E.P.F. to the trade. To manufacturers
that means Easy Processing Furnace —to you it can
mean better and more economical rubber products.
So to us, black is anything but a dull subject. We’ve
done, and continue to do, some pretty exciting things
with it. Long ago we added an enthusiasm that hasn’t
let us be content just to make quality carbon black.
We’ve researched product improvements, developed
new products. And 80% of our laboratory staff engaged
on quality assessment have been with us since our
beginnings seven years ago. That’s experience.
Result? Continuing technical advances that will let
rubber compounders’ imagination take flight —always
at a benefit to the customer.
So say bye-bye blackbird, and, next time you think
of black, will you think of us?

flame. Then pour in | bottle of good
red wine (drink the rest you deserve
it) and a small bundle of sweet herbs
(parsley, thyme, and a bayleaf). Cover
the casserole and cook in the oven
for an hour—or until tender. Mix two
tablespoons of flour with some of the
cooking juices and gradually add to the
sauce in the casserole to thicken.
Serve with french fried potatoes (fry
sliced onion and garlic until golden—
add parboiled potatoes, sliced, and
sprinkle with salt, pepper, and finely
chopped parsley).
Chicken liver risotto is quick and
reasonably exotic. I simmer 2 medium
onions, sliced, until golden, with a
clove or two of garlic. The livers (pre-
viously washed and separated and
steeped in a little milk for a few min-
utes) are then added to the pan. Stir
carefully so as not to break them, but
keep them moving to prevent sticking.
Add a bayleaf, some marjoram, and
some black pepper. In a separate pan
fry a few slices of mushrooms, sliced
tomatoes, and slivers of green capsi-
cum in that order.
While these are simmering, add a
large glass of red wine to your chicken
livers. When wine has reduced, add a
cube of chicken stock and a cup of
water. Bring to the boil and add suf-
ficient rice to absorb the liquid. Sim-
mer ten minutes and add the contents
of the other frying pan. Cook a few
more minutes and your dish is ready
to serve when most of the liquid has
been absorbed by the rice.
(If you are lucky enough to be able
to buy goose or duck livers, try frying
them with onion rings, apples, and a
few slices of tomatoes. Black pepper,
a bayleaf omit salt. Salt is added
only after serving as it tends to
toughen livers during cooking.)
We have a lot of Hungarian friends
all of them are fanatical eaters,
and most of them very good cooks. A
marvellous recipe for chicken pieces
and unexpected guests is Chicken
Paprikash. Hungarians only cook with
lard, but I’m forbidden to use it by
my husband, who is a cholesterolo-
phobe. So, if you’re the same, heat
some oil in a frying pan and add
of finely chopped onions and some
garlic.
When golden, add chicken pieces
cut into small portions and brown
quickly. Stir in an ounce of sweet
paprika. Then add a sliced green
capsicum and a sliced tomato. Season
to taste, and add a cube of chicken
stock, \ pint of white wine, and \ pint
of water. Simmer until tender. Just
before ready to serve remove some of
the stock and mix with 2 tablespoons
of flour; return to pot to thicken. Add
half a pint of cream and stir -- but do
not allow to boil. Serve with boiled
potatoes or gnocchi.

Alcan puts ideas into aluminium and
fast acting pain killers stay fresh longer...
on the bathroom shelf... in pocket or purse...
Disprin is made highly soluble to dissolve
quickly. To protect each and every tablet is
important—and Reckitt & Colman, manufac-
turers of Disprin, called in Alcan to meet
the challenge.
The answer was a strip-pack made from
Alcan aluminium foil. Why foil . . . because
being a thin sheet of metal, aluminium
foil is the perfect barrier to ensure
protection—the sort of protection that keeps
products factory fresh.
Only Alcan strip-packaging foil could
efficiently seal Disprin to withstand
atmospheric variations and prolong
shelf life —impossible with existing bottles
and tubes. After rigorous testing Reckitt
& Colman considered Alcan's strip-pack
equal if not better to any in the world.
Result: improved packaging efficiency. Now
Disprin stays fresh on the bathroom shelf
indefinitely, and can be carried conveniently
in pocket or purse.
Just one of the many ways Alcan puts ideas
into aluminium—and makes the world a
slightly easier place for man to live in,
even when he has a headache.

WEEK

A SIGH of relief must have gone up
among the small army which produces
the new ABC program, “This Day
Tonight,” when Prime Minister Holt
complained in Parliament last week
that the program was “not objective
and impartial.” For a program which
ABC executives say is costing about
$1 million a year, “This Day Tonight”
had begun badly; critics had attacked
it or, worse, implied they hadn’t expec-
ted anything more. Then, in the nick
of time, questions in the House. Now
its long lite is assured, and any weak-
nesses can be cloaked by martyrdom.
Clean bov/led
THE AMERICAN magazine “News-
week” last week had a review of C. P.
Snow’s latest book, “Variety of Men,”
in which the reviewer talked about
“England’s two supreme cricketers,
Bradman and Hobbs.” Time was when
that would have been enough for
“Newsweek” to have been confiscated
by Customs.
Goodwill
THE AMERICAN TV series “Rat
Patrol,” dealing in a fictional way with
the Desert Campaigns of World War
11, may be seen in Australia if Sydney’s
Channel 10 goes through with a deal,
but it was taken off British television
because of the Digger hat an American
in the cast wears.
The Americans profess bewilderment
at the fuss. “That hat has been one
of the real identification marks of the
show,” said a member of the “Rat
Patrol” unit. “The Australians might
never know what kind of goodwill that
hat has given them.”
Actually, we always felt we got a
fair amount of goodwill out of our
part in the Desert Campaigns.

SOCIOLOGISTS may watch with
interest the progress of the bar deter-

tance to the complete switchover to

their old-fashioned bar-soaps. But the
manufacturers always have another
old-fashioned trick up their sleeve
this time, the bar detergent.

AUSTRALIA
Slick phrases and startlingly
expensive schemes
IT WAS ANTI-COMMONWEALTH
week in Canberra, a mood set off by the
arrival in the national capital of the
Secretary-General of the Common-
wealth Secretariat, Mr. Arnold Smith.
Officials who would normally go out of
their way to encourage discussion with
a visitor from Asia, complained that
Mr. Smith was taking up their time.
The Commonwealth has few cham-
pions in Canberra. Men who believe
that Australia should take its involve-
ment in Asia seriously point out that
this does not leave much over for the
Commonwealth. And the Prime Minis-
ter is known to have found the Com-
monwealth Prime Ministers’ meeting in
London last year even more frustrating
and irrelevant than he had feared. He
has said that he might not go to the
next.
Mr. Arnold Smith, a quick-speaking
Canadian, did his best. He turned up
some slick phrases and some startlingly
expensive schemes, one of them for a
$4O million export development plan—
market surveys, technical assistance,
subsidies for shipping, promotional
money—to boost the exports of the less
developed countries of the Common-
wealth. Other schemes were for multi-
lateral aid projects and technical
assistance.
One Australian official pointed out
that only four of the 26 members of
the Commonwealth were “developed.”
Of these, one (Britain) was retrenching
and another (New Zealand) was broke.
That would leave Australia and Canada.
Officials complained that the Secre-
tariat’s working papers are flimsy; that
meetings are called without time for
"Now, if I wggm..." Mr. Smith
with Britain’s Secretary for Gamman-
wealth Affairs, Mr. Bowden (left)
“But will they listen. .."
preparation; and that Mr. Smith had no
clear or detailed proposals to put to
them. The general feeling was that
while Australia would avoid any posi-
tive acts which might break up the
Commonwealth, it will make sure that
the schemes of an ambitious bureau-
cracy do not distract it from important
tasks in Asia.
U.S. soldiers
$50m. invasion
AUSTRALIA LIVED UP to its repu-
tation for luck last week. Just as it was
announced that there was to be a fur-
ther cut in American investment in Aus-
tralia, tourist experts were working out
that the figure would probably be made
up by the spending of U.S. troops who
will soon be coming on “rest and
recuperation” leave in Australia.
A hundred thousand a year are ex-
pected to come, and, while the Federal
'Treasury conservatively estimates their
spending at $lB million, the leader of
the U.S. team which surveyed Australia
as a rest centre said that on past experi-
ence he expects troops to spend up to
$5OO each, which makes $50,000,000.
Add to this fuel and supply purchases
and air landing fees to be paid by the
huge fleet of airliners which will fly into
Sydney and our annual revenue from
tourism (estimated at $59 million last
vear) will be doubled. This is equal
to an extra 30 million bushels of wheat
or a two-cent rise in the price of wool.
Several Federal Ministers opposed the
American move for fear of puritan
public reaction. A Canberra public
servant commented last week that rather
than being denoted “R and R,” it
should be frankly called “I and I”
intercourse and intoxication. Cries of
VD have predictably been raised, but
health officials take the view that while
no infected Americans will come in,
unfortunately some infected Americans
will go out.
“Lifeline”
International
LAST WEEK THE Reverend Alan
Walker, of Sydney’s Central Methodist
Mission, was checking the galleys of
'The Lifeline Story,” to be published
in Britain and the U.S.A. later this
year, in which he tells how the idea
(now Lifeline International) began and
spread. In 1958 he was doing a Channel
9 television show “I Challenge the
Minister,” and troubled people began
to ring him at home to ask for advice.
Eventually he found this work more
than one man could handle, and from
that experience “Lifeline” was born in
March, 1963 a counselling service
which anyone could ring for help, 24
hours a day.
“Lifeline” soon became part of the
Sydney scene and was copied in other
States. There are Lifeline centres in
Adelaide, Brisbane, and Broken Hill,
with others likely to be formed in
Perth, Launceston, and Darwin. Two
years ago a “Time” article brought
international inquiries, a Lifeline
International was formed at a conven-
tion in Sydney last August with the
Rev. Walker as first president, and
there are now centres in New Zealand,
South Africa, England, Canada,
Mexico, and the U.S.A., all patterned
on the Sydney centre.
Meanwhile, in four years, the daily
calls on Lifeline, Sydney, have increased
and the voluntary counselling staff
is still being expanded. Trainees are
tutored for 11 weeks, then selected by
an interviewing panel and spend three
months on probation, working with
an experienced counsellor. About half
the callers are passed on to “resources
in depth,” panels of legal, medical, and
social service advisers; and for the
critical instant-help call (would-be
suicides, for example) there are mobile
trouble teams ready the whole 24 hours.
All of the volunteer counsellors have
a refresher course each few months,
with lectures and group discussions, to


Rev. Alan Walker
“keep the minds behind Lifeline
lively.”
Finally, and perhaps most impor-
tantly, there is a “caring division” of
trained helpers who are not only coun-
sellors, but are also ready to meet that
big-city need, loneliness, when someone
needs a friend.
Censorship
The Collins case
“UNIFORM CENSORSHIP” as prac-
tised , by Customs came to light last
week when Australian booksellers were
conferring on the Gold Coast, and the
managing director of Collins’ Book
Depot of Melbourne one of Aus-
tralia’s largest was called to the
phone to hear that his company’s
warehouses, shops, and even some
directors’ homes, had been raided by
Customs Department officers.
It was a real “fall in line, stand
to attention” affair, with exact timing
to prevent the word being passed from
store to store, as though it was a
drugs, booze, or gambling police action.
And yet, in Canberra, three days later
the Minister, Senator Anderson, ex-
plained it had merely been that an
arrangement between Customs and the
bookseller had “fallen down.”
Senator Anderson said, “An inspec-
tion was made and my Department is
not certain the arrangement is work-
ing satisfactorily.”
The “afrangement” allows booksellers
to store book imports until a Customs
officer has checked their titles and, if
some sound suspect, “inspected” them
further. A clearance allows their sale.
The system sometimes leads to the
holding over of children’s books, or
those with such suspicious names as
“Fun in Bed,” a book on occupational
therapy.
Senator Anderson’s men had im-
pounded Collins’ lists, invoices, and who
knows what else? The arrangement had
been suspended, on unstated grounds.
Senator Anderson was not telling,
neither were Collins’ directors. And
plenty of other booksellers were worry-
ing. The “normal system” to which Col-
lins are subject, “pending a new
arrangement,” is storage at the book-
seller’s cost where Customs say, and
release only when Customs decide,
whenever that .might be.
Western Australia
A 4m.-acre "grab"
SEVERAL STATES HAVE marginal
land problems. South Australia intends
to open up 750,000 .acres between
Adelaide and the Victorian border,
Western Australia has a proposal to
develop more than four million acres
north of the Bight, and Queensland has
been accused of “selling a birthright”
to Americans in Cape York. Caution
is understandable, always with the
ultimate fear that it may turn out to
have been deplorable. The Western
Australian Development Corporation,
backed by some of the world’s biggest
investors (including the non-profit
Battelle research organisation) appears
to aim at the impossible carrying
out research for its own sake, yet carry-
ing it out on such a scale, backed by
such technological resources that there
can be a confident expectation it will
pay off.
The corporation came to the West
in 1963 after two of the prime movers
had set off the wheels that will
result in a tunnel under the English
Channel. Soon after their forerunner,
Professor Hollister Kent, arrived in
Perth, he produced “the grey booklet,”
in which he wrote of using Operation
Plowshare to atomically blast water
storage areas, of planting oranges in
the desert, of desalinating seawater or
diverting rivers, and of using the West-
ern Australians’ wilderness for a staging
post for supersonic aircraft.
WADC seeks 4.4 million acres of
near desert between the Bight and
the east-west highway near Balledonia.
They have agreed to spend at least
$1 million on the area within five years,
and while most of the discussion has
centred on agricultural ventures, they
have made it clear they will try any-
thing. A few weeks ago yet another sub-
committee was appointed to look into
the scheme after Cabinet had inspected
the barren expanse and had returned
impressed, but several back-benchers
are yet to be convinced.
One of the most contentious state-
ments in the latest round of the long
fight came from the corporation’s agri-
cultural adviser Mr. Laurie Down, who
said he believed the scheme was “hope-
lessly unrealistic” without an area that
was in danger of being trimmed off,
a 200,000-acre portion which he believes
might change the scheme to just plain
unrealistic.
Mr. Down, who makes his living
advising people on new farming tech-
niques, believes that even the best areas
could not be anything like the bonanza
WADC’s critics see. But, like others
who have actually visited the area, he
is firmly convinced of the integrity of
the WADC philosophy, adding: “They
have the sort of courage that makes
the world worth while.” This convic-
tion may yet rub off on to other West-
ern Australians provided that the
corporation will wait that long.
Exports
Sad season
“SHE’S APPLES” (for it’s all right) is
a Tasmanian expression in fairly wide-
spread use in Australia, but not a good
one to use right now in either Tas-
mania or Western Australia, both apple
exporters in trouble, mainly because
growers in Argentina and South
Africa have beaten them to the tradi-
tional U.K. and European markets;
half the time and at lower freights.
Last month the Tasmanian growers
asked the Federal Government to cover
production costs and overseas freights
for the 1967 season, but were turned
down, even though ’67 shipments would
be smaller due to the hot summer and
the refusal of overseas agents to take
risks. W.A. growers are similarly
affected. Although their main crops
of Granny Smiths are welcome over-
seas, South Africa’s are more so. To
add to the Western Australians’
troubles, recent gales ruined many
crops.
The quest now must be for alterna-
tive markets. Mainland States rarely
absorb their local apple growers’ pro-
duct, so offer Tasmania little help.
Distance beats the Western Australians.
The solution lies somewhere among a
“two apples a day” campaign for Aus-
tralians, an Asian export promotion,
or more juicing and drying, which
create problems of their own, including
freight costs. Perhaps the only answer
would be another “Granny Smith.”


New dynamics for Australia
AFTER HIS TOUR of South-East
Asia Prime Minister Harold Holt seems
on the threshold of discovering a new
country Australia. That might be a
slightly unfair description of a process
that now seems under way, a process
in which Holt is turning from concen-
tration upon Foreign Affairs to a re-
assessment of the Australian scene and
Australian needs.
Actually the process has been go-
ing on for some time, but only now is
it starting to be discernible. In a way
it illustrates the thought processes of
Holt, essentially a pragmatist if ever
there was one.
When Holt came to power only 16
months ago, it was clear that his tenure
was going to be decided by Foreign
Affairs. Australian relationship with
Asia, its involvement militarily in Viet-
nam, its alliance with the United
States, and its use of National Service-
men in overseas military operations
were obviously the issues on which he
would succeed in the Prime Minister-
ship or retire—rejected—to the com-
parative obscurity of the post of Oppo-
sition Leader.
Holt, who has the pragmatist’s very
real assessment of where lies the seat
of power, and desire to occupy that
particular seat, understandably gave his
almost exclusive attention to these
Foreign Affairs issues. Even after he
had successfully and triumphantly
survived the ordeal of a Federal
Election and returned to office with a
record House of Representatives’
majority his interest in Foreign Affairs
continued.
Again this reflected his pragmatism.
Rightly or wrongly, he believes that
Australia’s future survival depends on
the relationship it establishes with Asia.
With this, to his mind, Australia’s No. 1
problem, he gave it his almost exclusive
attention. But having now established
the guidelines that he believes give Aus-
tralia the best chances of a working
relationship with Asia to ensure sur-
vival, Holt over recent weeks has per-
ceptibly been shifting his interest to the
local scene.
It is on such matters as overseas in-
vestment that the way his mind works is
shown most clearly. He formed the
judgment that overseas investment was
good for Australia, enabling it to de-
velop and secure living standards which
it could not obtain from its own re-
sources. So he supported the principle
of overseas investment unreservedly.
But then the question emerged whe-
ther Australia was using its own capital
resources to the extent that it should.
Without in any way departing from
his belief that overseas investment was
good both for Australia and Australians,
Holt and Treasurer McMahon asked
from ALAN REID in Canberra
themselves whether Australian capital
resources could be marshalled to an
extent that would make Australia less
dependent upon overseas investment.
Deputy Prime Minister, John Mc-
Ewen, had asked himself the same
question earlier, and between the three
of them schemes are now being pro-
duced that should place Australian
entrepreneurs in a position more closely
comparable, in access to financial back-
ing, to large overseas investors. Super-
ficially there is conflict between Mc-
Ewen and McMahon and to some
extent Holt on this foreign invest-
ment issue, but they are really arguing
on methods, not aims.
Now he has widened his local hori-
zons to include a social as well as an
economic aspect. For some time there
has been an uneasy feeling within the
Liberal Party that, despite the general
affluence of the Australian community,
there have been pockets of poverty,
especially among the aged who lack
family support, and the younger mar-
rieds who have produced large families
and supplemented realistically the
Immigration program, which is aimed
at increasing Australia’s population
and on which the Commonwealth
spends millions annually.
One of the reasons for the Liberal's
uneasiness over these pockets of
poverty was a belief that the situation
could be corrected at only a small
money cost that the solutions were
administrative as much as financial.
In a joint Government-parties meet-
ing last week, Holt promised to under-
take a full review of family allowances
a review that would cover the full
range from Child Endowment through
to Taxation rebates for dependents.
Again his pragmatism asserted itself.
When the matter came up for debate
in the Party room, three Ministers -
Labor Minister Bury, Immigration
Minister Snedden, and Social Services
Minister Sinclair - ranged alongside
him to provide any information not at
his fingertips. It was obvious that res-
ponsibility in this field was divided,
which could easily be why something
has not already been done about the
problem. Holt indicated that he would
appoint a single Minister to conduct
the review.
He went further. He applauded the
fact that his backbenchers were
supplying him with ideas. Differing
considerably from Sir Robert Menzies,
Holt does not consider he has any
monopoly in the field of imaginative
thought.
Holt took another step toward pro-
viding himself with a reservoir of
ideas. He announced the setting up of
a committee to study ways and means
whereby backbenchers can be given
prior knowledge of legislation the
Government is considering, and the
opportunity to criticise and advance
constructive suggestions.
So far, Holt’s discovery of Australia
is only partial. But unmistakably he
realises that the dynamics which car-
ried Australia across the years between
1949, when the Liberals came to
power, and last year when he took
over the Prime Ministerial reins, are
being exhausted, and fresh dynamics
have to be found.
He appears to have started on the
process of finding them, and in this
is interestingly reflecting a grassroots
feeling within his own Party, particu-
larly the younger section. The N.S.W.
Liberal president, Fred Osborne, has
already exhorted Young Liberals to
pay increasing attention to social prob-
lems (including the pockets of poverty
existing in Australia), and they appear
to be doing so. They have already
put strong views on the necessity to
preserve Australian equity in develop-
mental projects, and they have joined
with Labor’s Dr. Patterson in asking
whether Australians are being denied
equal opportunity with overseas inves-
tors in Northern Territory develop-
ment.
If Holt rediscovers Australia as
effectively as he discovered Asia, it
could give a new impetus to Austra-
lian development over the next few
decades.


Interview
145th appointment
P[?] Sadruddin Aga Khan
TEA AND GAULOISES with Prince
Sadruddin Aga Khan in the Japanese
Suite at the Wentworth Hotel. “Look,”
said Mr. John Goodwin of the Depart-
ment of Immigration, “do you mind
if we cut this down to twenty minutes?
The thing is, he has to get to Bob
Sanders at ABC television, then r go to
a cocktail party at Rose Bay, then
dine with Sir Frank Packer, and change
somehow . . .” Well, it had been touch
and go all week w'hether Prince Sad-
ruddin would be available for inter-
view. Anything, at this stage, was
acceptable.
The Prince wore a blue suit, blue
spotted tie, thick woollen socks, and a
pair of dusty black moccasins. The
dust came from the Opera House,
round w'hich he had been given a
lightning conducted tour. Whatever
anyone else said about it, he saw the
building as symbolic of Australia ■ —
large, exciting, and challenging. Would
we like a Gauloise?
Tea arrived and Mr. Goodwdn re-
turned once more with what Prince
Sadruddin called his Bulletin: a 60-
page glossy magazine report on
refugees. This, of course, is what
brought him to Australia a couple of
weeks ago. As United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees he hoped
to stimulate public and Government
interest in the problem of refugee re-
habilitating. This is a subject about
which he holds forth passionately,
knowledgeably, and, at times, non-
stop. Whether this trip has been suc-
cessful can only be assessed by w'hat
happens in the future, not by immedi-
ate Box Office reaction. He has two
more years to serve and if it were
possible to work the High Commission
out of a job he would be a happy man.
Meanw'hile, on this visit, his first to
Australia, he w'as thankful for small
mercies. The local habit of dining
early, for instance, ensured a reason-
able getaway at about 11 p.m. This
gave him time to write his thank-you
letters, prepare speeches and things for
the following day. Goodness, no, he
wasn’t tired. The immigration people
thought he looked exhausted? He gave
a working dinner-party in Canberra, and
it was reported next day that two men
fell asleep over coffee. He teased them
no end about it.
He produced a 36-page grey booklet
which was his itinerary (composed by
Mr. Goodwin in ten days flat. “You
should see the Canberra one, done by
the Prime Minister’s department. Theirs
is timed to the second, mine is only to
the minute”), and consisted of some 145
appointments in 14 days, not counting
the first two spent at Kirribilli House
where he put in some energetic sailing
on “Vim” and “Dame Pattie.” His
return visit to New South Wales co-
incided with Tun Abdul Razak’s at
Kirribilli House, thus his move to the
Wentworth.
Mr. Goodwin bounded in, as if
announcing the winner of a race, but
his face registered that old familiar
expression of End Interview. “I am
sorry, but if I am to get the High
Commissioner to Bob Sanders—.”
Quite. We appreciated Mr. Sanders’
problems. Supposing we came, too?
Well, if the Prince didn’t mind, could
he change in fifteen minutes?
We vacated the Japanese Suite and
next door Mr. Goodwin, between shav-
ing and hunting for a telephone number,
said yes, he was glued to the High
Commissioner from the minute he
arrived to the minute he left. It was
a new' experience for him and though
it was interesting he wouldn’t be sorry
when it was all over. He thought he
had an ulcer coming on.
Well, whatever Bob Sanders has got
that we are denied, Prince Sadruddin
emerged a good deal more relaxed
than he w'ent in. For instance, we
learnt that if he weren’t following his
calling he w'ould really rather be a
journalist. Did we know he published
the quarterly “Paris Review'”? It had
a good circulation, but didn’t pay for
itself. And then he w'anted to write
a book about his father. There had
been some published in the East but
none in the West and he wanted people
to know what the late Aga Khan was
really like: “. . . father felt life w'as a
calling, and not something to be
frittered away . . .” But he was a
perfectionist and he couldn’t contem-
plate waiting while he w'as doing a
job. “I work hard and I play hard.
I take a boat on the Aegean every
year and have my friends about me
-—and I can’t see myself doing any
writing then.”
We said goodbye at the Chevron.
Mr. Goodwdn crept tiredly into the
back seat and braced himself for the
party ahead. He will be pleased to
know that the next time Prince Sad-
druddin comes to Australia it will be
privately. As a tourist.
DAPHNE GUINNESS
South Australia
Field of four
WITH THE MUFFLED thunder of
the 1967 Victorian election next door,
South Australia’s Labor Government is
preparing for its own 1968 encounter
with the electorate, and the first action
will be to choose a new leader when
Premier Frank Walsh steps down in a
few weeks. It looked like a field of
three for the succession Deputy
Leader Frank Hutchens, hard-working
Attorney-General Don Dunstan, and
Agriculture Minister Gabriel Bywaters
until Des Corcoran, 38, Minister for
Lands, threw his hat in the ring.
Corcoran says he held back in
deference to his wife. “We have a
young family of four and hope soon
it will be five,” and he wanted her to
understand how it would be if she also
had a Premier to look after.
One of his popular traits is a willing-
ness to admit that he still has a lot
to learn. He has become the white
hope of those who are looking for a
more attractive alternative to Don
Dunstan than the 63-year-old sena-
torial Hutchens or the rather dour,
capable, Bywaters.
It is being whispered that the sort of
ear-to-ground soundings which are
supposed to take MPs into their elec-
torates between sessions have been anti-
Dunstan hence the fresh pressure
on Corcoran to stand, including a
strong nudge from Premier Walsh.
The choice lies with 25 members of
Caucus the 21 Labor members of
the Assembly and the solitary four in
the Legislative Council.
Customs
Oral declaration
THE RECENT INTRODUCTION of
oral declarations to speed Customs for-
malities for overseas air passengers has
produced an interesting side benefit —■
it is stopping more would-be
smugglers.
The new system was introduced on
a limited basis at Sydney Airport on
May 1 to replace the lengthy written
declaration form, and has proved so
successful that it has been extended
to cover all international airline flights
arriving in Australia.
Filling out a Customs declaration is
like making out an Income Tax return
-—people are inclined to fiddle a bit.
But, confronted with a Customs official
looking him straight in the eye, the un-
wary air traveller doesn’t have time to
think up an excuse for that piece of
goods he was trying to get through.
Customs officers say they are very
pleased with the results of the new
system, and if it continues successfully
over the trial period they will extend
it to ship arrivals.


Agrisearch
An old path out of the
dairy impasse
TWENTY-ONE YEARS ago when we
were taking a hard-headed look at our-
selves and setting about “rural recon-
struction” the Executive of the then
CSIRO submitted a bold scheme to the
Dairy Produce Board. It was frankly
entitled, “Some Rational Steps To-
ward a Stable and Efficient Dairy
Industry.” One of its main proposals
was that the dairy industry should
take over the production of margarine!
Though much more milk now flows
past the butter factories and into the
calmer markets for proteinaceous
foods than in those days, the report
should be disinterred from whichever
pigeon-hole encoffins it. The dairy
problem will remain as long as arti-
ficial solutions are offered. This report
suggested some natural paths out of
the impasse. Can anyone recall who
decided it was smelly and buried it?
Was it ever released for public con-
sideration?
Even if the particular methods pro-
posed nearly a generation ago,
whereby dairyfarmers were to supply
the margarine industry, are no longer
viable, the general philosophy expres-
sed in the report would still be suf-
ficiently robust to shoulder aside the
puny policies currently accepted or
proposed to protect butter. “When
you can’t beat ’em, join ’em” has
always been a wise counsel. The
engineers of the “Rational Steps” re-
port took the sound view that when
technological developments occur there
is much less social dislocation or dis-
turbance of any kind if those in the
established industry can move into the
new. The glimpse of a skeleton in a
cupboard has been revealed in a plain-
tive note appearing in the latest issue
of the “Australian Journal of Dairy
Technology.”
It would seem that the Dairy Re-
search Section of CSIRO back in 1946
had the vision to see that the margarine
baby would develop into a lusty “Mrs.
Jones.” Its plan was to husband her by
finding oil-seed crops which would
flourish in the various dairying districts.
One-fifth of the area of each farm was
to be put under oil-seeds each year to
reap a threefold benefit. The cropping
program would have resulted in better
pastures, the meal left after the oil was
extracted from the seed would have
provided the cows with a rich feed
supplement, and the oil itself, of course,
would have given the farmer a cash
dividend besides a legitimate voice in
the control of margarine production.
The better pastures, together with the
meal ration, it was confidently believed,
would have held total milk production
from the smaller grazing area of the
farm at a level at least as high as would
have been obtained from the full area
of pasture.
Apparently the Dairy Section was not
encouraged at the time to seek the
missing link that would have given this
attractive scheme reality. The names of
the particular oil-seeds that the plan-
ners had in mind for the job are not
breathed in this latest gasp from the
report that is buried alive. Sunflower is
probably one of them. Soyabean and
crambe may have been others. Though
the chance of readily diversifying the
dairying industry by vegetable-oil pro-
duction has probably passed, the poten-
tial of these neglected species still de-
serves thorough exploration. Among
them is a wide range of genotypes, and
it would be surprising if an exhaustive
Soyabean for dairy farms?
selection and breeding program failed to
find high oil-yielding capacity linked
with suitability to the coastal environ-
ments. Generally, a more imaginative
search for new crops should be under-
taken.
The fact that the majority of the
world’s people to this day obtain most
of their sustenance from only a dozen
different crops is reason enough to
launch a research study of, say, sun-
flower. More than 30 percent of all
human energy is derived from rice
alone. Such is the historical legacy
of man’s efforts to feed himself from
all the vast variety of wild plants that
have appeared on earth. The mag-
nitude of our dependence on so few
crops is really appalling. No humani-
tarian could bear to ponder the con-
sequences if some rapidly spreading
disease of rice appeared like the blight
that settled on the potato a century
ago.
With such realisations and terrors
before him, anyone looking out on the
broad pattern of agricultural research
in Australia must conclude that it is
ill-proportioned. Far too little effort is
being spent on horticulture and the
development of new crops in compari-
son to the giant sweep of the investi-
gations covering pastures and animals.
What the world needs if it is to keep
from starving is more high-protein/'
high-energy crops such as soyabean and
peanuts. Roasted sunflower seed is
rich and delectable. It is not just
meant for parrots. Perhaps the 3000
dairyfarmers proscribed for elimina-
tion under the more recent “rational”
proposal advanced by the Dairy Indus-
try Committee of Enquiry (1960)
might care to agitate for some action
along the lines set out in the earlier
CSIRO plan.
THE WESTERN Australian Depart-
ment of Agriculture has announced its
entrance into jhe “Big Science” league
with the completion of a “controlled
environment facility” at its main labor-
atories at South Perth. The facility is
basically an elaborate glasshouse in
which a wide range of natural climates
can be simulated at will and closely
controlled automatically. Structures of
this kind have been dubbed “phyto-
trons” by ego-building American biolo-
gists wanting to pretend that their
science competes in complexity, costli-
ness, and in the massiveness of its hard-
ware with atom-smashing science.
Actually, the Western Australian
installation is relatively small-time,
even by Australian standards. It con-
sists at present of only four compart-
ments or cabinets in which the climate
can be totally controlled, and two
larger glass-enclosed areas. In these
areas temperatures and day length only
can be adjusted. In the cabinets, light
intensity and humidity can be con-
trolled as well. More cabinets, each of
which provides about 20 square feet of
bench space, can be added later. Cost
to date is $70,000 and the sandgropers
are prepared to meet the high annual
running costs. They expect that
lighting tubes alone will cost
$lOOO a year.
The only other phytotron in Aus-
tralia is owned and operated by the
CSIRO Division of Plant Industry at
Canberra. It was completed about five
years ago and christened Ceres, after
the goddess of corn. Ceres cost the
Commonwealth Treasury about $1
million to build, but it comprises 50

Money for the Western Australian

told that it will assist in the breeding
of wheats better adapted to the dif-

Man on the Land
More baskets than
the Egg Boards
THE CONTINUING war between
State Egg Boards and free-trading pro-
ducers took an interesting turn in
Werribee Court, Victoria, where a
stipendiary magistrate ruled that the
Victorian Egg Board did not have the
power to administer the Commonwealth
Egg Marketing Authority’s (CEMA)
levy. The magistrate, Mr. D. G. Gude,
exonerated two producers who had
been brought into court by the Egg
Board for alleged evasion of levies.
A number of cases similar to this
have been heard in Victoria in the
past three months and the usual ruling
has been against the producers, who
have been fined about $lOO and
ordered to pay the amount of levy
owing. The magistrate at Werribee has
questioned the validity of CEMA,
which was recently upheld by the
Privy Council, but on the fine point
of whether a State body has been
properly empowered to act as a col-
lector of levies for the Commonwealth
Government. Naturally the Egg Board
will appeal and in all probability will
eventually win.
In 1965, when the CEMA plan was
introduced, we predicted that producer
resentment would run high and that
confusion was inevitable. Nothing has
happened to cause us to change that
opinion essentially. The CEMA plan
was based on contrived circumstances.
In order that the Commonwealth
Government could enter into egg
marketing at all there had to be export
sales of eggs (Section 92). Eggs were
exported, but at a loss on unreceptive
markets, and one was left with the
suspicion that these exports were made
with the object of keeping the Com-
monwealth powers, necessary during
World War 11, intact under the vastly
changed circumstances.
The plain and obvious fact was that
a growing body of producers, in all
States, had become disillusioned with
Egg Board marketing and had been
able to show that the Australian con-
sumer could be efficiently and ade-
quately provided with eggs without the
help of Egg Boards. The Free-Traders’
Council challenged the CEMA plan
through 1965 and 1966, eventually
losing in the Privy Council in London.
Egg Board jubilation was tempered by
the discovery that the free-traders had
another egg in another basket. A sys-
tem whereby any housewife can place
an order for so many eggs a week with
a shopkeeper, who acts as an agent for
an interstate producer, was devised to
circumvent Egg Board marketing. A
detailed description of this system was
sent by the Free-Traders’ Council to
Mr. Nigel Bowen, QC, before he be-
came Attorney-General, and his advice
was that the system was legally water-
tight.
The only catch with this system is
that, like the current margarine device
in marketing, it runs up against a cer-
tain amount of consumer indifference.
It is, nevertheless, an embarrassment
to the Egg Board and the fact that
Free-trading, or the Board?
it exists at all in the commercial sense
is an indication that many consumers
are dissatisfied with the eggs they get
through the Boards.
The overriding implications of the
complexities in egg marketing would
seem to be that laws have been framed
not with the welfare of the consumer
and producer in mind as much as the
preservation of governmental institu-
tions. It is a bad law when so many
people clearly want to break it and
it applies to what is simply a common
foodstuff. An intriguing aspect of this
latest wrangle will be Mr. Bowen’s
position now as- Attorney-General, as
distinct from that of a legal man in
private practice asked for an opinion.
The .locality of Werribee may not
be known to many people outside Vic-
toria. It is midway between Melbourne
and Geelong, and is probably the big-
gest egg-producing district in Australia.

COMENT
What do we do with the dairy industry?
IT HAS BEEN PART of our general
luckiness as Australians that we usually
manage to get through without a
crisis but it’s hard to see how this pro-
cess is going to go on working with
the Australian dairy industry. The
industry’s greatest friends may also be
its worst enemies, in the sense that
by not retreating a bit here and there
they are building up a sense of crisis
that may later burst over the industry
with harmful results. This year’s policy
of retaining the present margarine
quotas and extending the present
bounty for another five years may
merely be banking up resistances against
the industry that will later find their
own outlet.
The growing hatred of dairy farmers
is unfortunate. The ordinary dairy far-
mer is not a racketeering sybarite living
on taxpayers’ handouts but a man who
is often working too hard to make
enough money, since his holding is often
so small that he has to do everything
himself, thereby neglecting those ques-
tions of pasture improvement or animal
husbandry, for example, that could
increase the yield on his labor. It has
been Government policy in the past that
there should be tiny dairy farms. This
policy has been proved wrong. Where
there are milk zone areas it has also
been Government policy to reward
farmers not by their efficiency but by
their geographical placing. This policy
has also been proved wrong. Having
made these and other mistakes, Govern-
ments now paper over the cracks with
taxpayers’ money.
These policies should be reversed.
The industry should, where necessary,
be formed into bigger and more econ-
omic units. Milk production should be
encouraged only in those areas that are
best suited for it. And the enormous
body of scientific knowledge about
better dairying practices should be ex-
tended into the industry to increase its
efficiency. However, when Government
policies are reversed, those who have
carried them out should not be pen-
alised. For some years bounty money
should still be paid but to cushion
change, to encourage greater efficiency,
not merely to protect inefficiency. For
a while total expenditure might well go
up so that it could later come down.
So far as margarine quotas are con-
cerned, these should slowly be dis-
handed, on the principle that all-Aus-
tralian margarine should not be pena-
lised as against all-Australian butter,
Our system of protection for local
industry should not mean that one local
industry is protected against the other,
Many leaders of the industry are
not unaware that changes must occur,
They are right in asking that they
should have time, so that quick
changes do not create a general crisis,
But within the politics of the industry
it is difficult to say these things. What
the industry needs is brave leaders
who will risk losing their political
positions within the industry by say-
ing what they think. And it needs
toughies like N.S.W.’s Mr. Chaffey as
much as a hole in the milk bucket,
If Britain goes into the Common
Market and this endangers our dairy
exports and threatens to wreck New
Zealand, there will be such a political
crisis that mere pressure tactics will
not prevail. The industry should be
now attempting to regain the good
name that it deserves. It may need it.




The young executives
By CHARLES HIGHAM
GLENAVON, a private hotel in the
Sydney suburb of Edgecliff, has a
slightly seedy, raffish, Chandlerish
charm; but the scene out of doors on
a late summer afternoon was entirely
Australian. Men, short-sleeved and
heavy-boned, were playing mini-golf on
the lawn, table tennis on the veranda,
or walking about talking in the lunch-
break. The atmosphere was one of
sporty, relaxed bonhomie; and later, in
a lounge-room rigged up with a red-
baized conference table, high chairs,
polished silver carafes and glasses, the
feeling of a kind of senior scouts’ week-
end did not noticeably change.
The men present (slightly over a
dozen, all executives in their twenties
or thirties in training with IBM) were
there, after a week of discussions, of
determined togetherness, to see a small
play acted out. In front of them as
they laughed, nudged each other, and
flopped about open-necked in slacks or
shorts two IBM men, equally
casually dressed, incongruously acted
the roles in a little scene. One played
the part of “Tom Burke,” supervisor
of a department at IBM that includes
a junior designer, six draftsmen, and
two women clerks. The other played
the role of “George Stanley,” section
head. Tom was asking George for a
job which would put him in charge of
a number of sections, and ahead of his
competitors. Tom had been 12 years
with the company: solid, dependable,
a wife and two children. His unit was
very productive, but he lacked co-
operation with others, the team spirit.
He was conceited, selfish, and driving.
He had withdrawn from the league; he
was a lone wolf. He had, because of
his ruthless “push,” lost staff.
George listened to Tom’s application
and its self-congratulatory puffs, then
quietly, facetiously, and smoothly pulled
the rug from under him. Tom was dis-
closed as “an egotistical bastard” (this
brought very loud laughter from the
spectators), as the kind of person who
put selfish (and section) thinking first,
and hadn’t enough “company intelli-
gence.” He didn’t get the job.
“Tom might be getting results, but
the important thing is that he should
benefit his colleagues, his company, not
merely boost the profits of one section,”
someone said to me. As the play with
its little moral ended to an outburst of
laughter and applause, and everyone
settled down to analysing the fake inter-
view, it was clear that a message had
been spelt out to the young men
present: by all means have drive, but
first and foremost let your ego be
absorbed into the company’s overall
needs, and work with the selfless
absorption of a football league player
as a profit-making company man.
This IBM role-playing during a week-
long seminar at Glenavon is character-
istic of the management mystique now
followed by a large (and growing) sec-
tor of Australian business. True, it is
not the rule in those companies at the
industrial heart of the country, such as
BHP, many of whose training schemes
and company courses are aimed more
at drawing out leadership material than
establishing conformity, even though
their recruitment techniques seem to
depend heavily on the same criterion of
“acceptability” that is the basis of the
management game.
But conforming is increasingly the
rule in the “selling” business, where
the right “image,” the right approach,
the right appearance, the right accent,
the right thinking are all part of the
marketing game. “Selling” does not
simply mean retailing. Many of the
companies heavily involved in the man-
agement mystique are much more than
simply sellers of products, but their
selling function dominates their
approach. Many of the “executives” in
computer companies like IBM and
National Cash Register and inter-
national oil companies who play the
management game in Australia are little
more than sophisticated salesmen. And
their “selling” emphasis tends to give
them an attitude that extends over their
other non-selling functions.
In recent years the system of teaching
young men how to play business team
football has grown to a complexity
scarcely dreamed of even by Vance
Packard. It stems, like most of such
“psychological” methods now being
used here, from the United States.
Away from the job, in hotels or speci-
ally bought premises with recreation
facilities, men are put to the test as
satisfactory players in the executive
team game. Getting a job that will
ensure a future as an executive may
present hurdles, but this has nothing on
the kind of obstacle course that then
has to be run in some companies. (In
selling organisations there are often
more executives than workers; more
chiefs than Indians; and they come
from a different stratum of the merito-
cracy; many of those recruited into
selling are those who may have been
unsuccessful in businesses without com-
pany rules, a strict line of conformity to
guide them.)
At the initial interview, well pressed,
hair carefully cut, face presumably
shining with health and ambition, the
young man just out of school we
haven’t reached American standards
where a college degree is almost always
a necessity with a Leaving or Higher
School Certificate (perhaps to matricu-
lation standard) or their equivalent is
liable to be looked at very sharply by
anything from one to six men, all of
them by now almost certainly over 40
and thoroughly stamped with the com-
pany image.
The interviewers are apt to be tough,
rather military-looking men with an
aggressively Australian vein of mascu-
line heckling. They will take note
with eyes sharpened by long practice
of hair (must be short back and sides),
of the suit (must be dark and well
pressed), of the face (clean-cut still
more importantly, clean-shaven), of
the shoes (black for preference well
polished and heeled). An athletic look is
sought for; nothing too scholarly about
the appearance, no suede and nothing
green. A school prefect is preferred, or,
in case the interviewer is slightly sus-
picious of favoritism in a particular
school’s elevation of a certain boy to
prefecthood, a sports captain, and some-
one interested in group activities, church
movements, social events. A spokesman
for Shell said: “Why not a smile? We
don’t like long hair, don’t hand us a
wet fish to shake our hands with, don’t
slouch, don’t wear a sweater or open-
necked shirt, think of your answers be-
fore answering, speak up.”
An applicant, “confident in approach,
looking you straight in the eye, bright-
eyed,” to quote the Shell man again,
may have to take a formidable battery
of aptitude and psychological tests to
establish his keenness, drive, lack of
neurosis or “oddity,” and Ability to
Get Along with Others, the golden rule
of every company. No army panel
examined its prospective enrolments
with so gimlet an eye. Even hand-
writing experts are used—the doyenne
of these is Mrs. Patricia Schutz, of
Hornsby, N.S.W.—to determine charac-
ter, enterprise, and determination. Too
much scholastic interest is suspect; the
average is always preferred to the bril-
liant.
To filter through many potential
executives, a whole industry has grown
up here in recent years: the manage-
ment consultant game. (The Sydney
pink pages list 123 such firms.) First
of these to get off the ground—pre-
World War ll—was, according to his
claim, Haigwood Masters, today, with
his wife, Josephine, still frequently
called in as a consultant to dozens of
com panies on the promotion of execu-
tives, on the suitability of young men
f or higher postings up the executive
pyramid.
Masters’ beginnings were at the age
of 12 (almost 50 years ago), when he
bought a book on how to read faces.
He analysed a nurse to the household
0 f O’Donnell Griffin, joined that busi-
ness chief’s staff, and began analysing
people for jobs at Griffin’s various
workshops. From these he analysed
faces of breadcarters applying for jobs
while working as a carter himself. At
Bebarfalds’ furniture store he was hired
as part of a home furnishing display,
advising young married couples inspect-
ing p on what they would have to
alter in their characters to ensure a
happy marriage. A client was the late
Charles Cousens. Cousens praised
Masters on 2GB, and H. P. Christmas
. who started Woolworths stores in
Australia took him on as a consult-
ant on hiring personnel. He was still
in his teens.
For many years, first for Woolworths
and later for David Jones until the
retirement of Sir Charles Lloyd Jones,
Masters continued as Australia’s first
consultant in the field, aided for many
years by his wife, a psychology
graduate and lecturer of Sydney Uni-
versity (at one stage they would thread
their way through the selling floors of
David Jones, advising on whether one
young man looked suitable for promo-
tion or another did not).
After World War 11, John P. Young
Associates, management consultants,
developed to a high degree of sophis-
tication a number of techniques of in-
terviewing. Psychological tests were
used by this firm and others like W. D.
Scott. The Australian Institute of In-
dustrial Psychology also developed its
own complex personality tests, now
used for 299 companies (its chief
even flies overseas every month or
two, to advise overseas companies with
branches here on the hiring of per-
sonnel), but many of the management
consultants simply use American tests,
or variants thereof.
The majority of these are simple
“alternative question” tests. Although
none is available for public inspection,
samples obtained from various sources
disclose items like: “Which would you
prefer to visit, a science display featur-
ing the latest electronic devices, an art
gallery, a library?” No prizes for guess-
ing that a tick against the first of these
choices would ensure favorable hearing
at an interview (“We don’t want long-
hairs here,” a National Cash Register
man told me).
At W. D. Scott, an applicant for
executive training, as well as being in-
spected like a fly under a microscope
for general deportment, bearing, and
uncomplicated masculinity, would have
to answer a battery of 300 questions,
These are known as “temperament
tests.” “Here,” said Bill McLatchie, a
psychologist-interviewer at Scotts with
a clean-cut face, Scots burr, and brisk,
no-nonsense manner, “are two of the
sorts of questions we ask: ‘Does it take
much arguing to convince most people
of the truth?’ ‘ls it unusual for you to
express an opinion strongly?’
“From answers to questions like
these, we determine whether a man
basically shows persistence in sticking
to whatever an organisation needs. And
we also try to find out: Does he show
an adequate regard for the well-being
of other people? How social is he? Is
he adequately cautious or is he apt
to be oyer-cautious in his approach to
a problem? Is he perhaps a little
impulsive? Is he a firm person or too
readily swayed by even suspicious argu-
ments? Or is he not firm enough, or
too firm?” McLatchie flashed one fully
answered questionnaire in front of my
eyes, then another. On one was written
the words “Too defensive,” on another
“Too compliant.” “If a chap says yes
in answer to too many questions we can
see that he is simply too suggestible.”
W. D. Scott gets through 2000 people
a year in Sydney, in batches of 65.
John P. Young’s Ray Barker, a
psychologist who studied with Eysenck,
said: “You have to get rid of all non-
company thoughts as you go up the
ladder. Like those Chinese who have
to get rid of ‘bad thoughts.’ ” Young
puts his applicants through a series of
psychological hurdles no less taxing
than W. D. Scott’s. In addition to
team-playing conformism, Barker said
that companies often had specific de-
mands: one firm won’t employ famous
sportsmen on the grounds that sports
will eat into their spare time (which
should be spent on job study), whereas
others - Shell, for instance might
prefer to have well-known sportsmen
on the staff for publicity purposes.
Baker said there was quite often racial
prejudice and nepotism in the process
of executive selection.
In some cases, Barker said, the wife
was interviewed. One recent applicant
for a post had been rejected because
his wife drank too much; in another
case, she was a permanent invalid,
which would prevent the executive from
being away from home for long periods.
“A bachelor applicant over 35 we’d
want to look at pretty closely. In some
cases he might be over-dependent on
his mother.” Sometimes if two men
were in close competition for a job,
they might be taken to dinner sepa-
rately by the head of a company and
their wives watched. The best wife
would win.
When a conformist with a balanced
intelligence restricted to business inter-
ests has been hired, there begins the
process of acquainting him with what
the business is all about, of “circulating
the trainee” between one department
and the other. Typical is the case of
David Rennie, a Unilever cadet execu-
tive; since he joined the company in
1959 he has worked in various depart-
ments as well as serving six months on
the road as a salesman, six months in
advertising, a period with marketing
research, and so on.
At some of the chainstores, the
going is especially rugged. Pay can be
poor in the early and middle stages,
and the education level called for is
sometimes low (not even up to Leav-
ing). Many drift into the chains because
they haven’t made it to university,
their family is too poor to send them
there, or they have failed in trying
for some more elevated occupation.
Once in, they are subjected to dis-
cipline and at some stores they have
been issued with a list of instructions,
including smiling regularly and looking
up, not down, at a counter, which are
intended to keep the customer happy.
They may have to reach a minimum
sales quota each week (in some cases,
specific multiples of their salaries) or
risk demotion or dismissal.
I asked, at Woolworths, to speak to
the kind of young man the firm valued
most highly, a trainee executive now


part of his way up the ladder. Peter
Rodowicz is 22, trim build, clean-cut,
short-back-and-sides. He said he was
subjected to four interviews on joining
the company (which he had come to
after failing to matriculate; he had
intended to study Law). One informal
interview was with a store manager,
another to test his personal interests,
another to analyse his group activities,
and so on. “They were trying to find
out what kind of an all-rounder I was.
They were using cut-throat methods,
they were determined to find out as
much as they could about my mind. I
was made to feel that what they wanted
was a practical person who could make
decisions quickly, who would have
absorbative grasp.”
Rodowicz started in the pet food
division at the Kings Cross store,
moved to stockkeeper, service manager,
then round various other stores until he
had a number of sales assistants work-
ing under him. Regular group discus-
sions were designed to make a man feel
“part of Woolworths.” Rodowicz was,
clearly, a prototype: he belonged to a
car club, played handball and foot-
ball, had a firm, very dry handshake.
“He’s typical of the young man we’re
looking for,” said Charles Martin, the
firm’s Sydney personnel boss.
At David Jones the same qualities are
looked for. Rodney Harris, the young
executive I spoke to there, is similar
to Peter Rodowicz of Woolworths in
his direct manner, military stance,
clean-cut appearance, and apparent lack
of complexity. He left school at 15,
drifted from job to job, worked in
children’s shoes for Myers in Mel-
bourne, and wound up at David Jones,
taking first the junior, and later the
senior executive training courses, which
involve regular attendance at lectures
and discussions of job problems. He
works sometimes three or four nights a
week on special projects set by the
executive trainers: selecting suitable
sites for regional shopping centres in the
Sydney suburbs, designing drafts for
exhibitions for D.J’s at the Show-
ground. He is a member of the St.
Matthew Church of England Fellow-
ship, and plays squash regularly.
Was there much competition? “Not
so much among salesmen on the counter
many of these have no ambition,
they just want their money, then they
go home. But among the junior execu-
tives, especially when they become
buyers, yes. Each section naturally likes
to better the other in profits, and the
competition here can be particularly
fierce.” (After the interview a nervous
staff training official telephoned me to
say that there wasn’t any inter-section
throat-cutting of this kind, that Harris
was anxious about a “misinterpretation
of his statement.”)
Margaret Allsop, an executive trainee
of the same store, said: “As a trainee
you’re shifted from department to de-
partment as an assistant to the buyers,
and each buyer has to write a report
on you. On your conduct, initiative,
the way you deal with customers, and
a whole long list of things besides. You
have to be continually on your toes,
or it will go against you in a report.
Attendance record, appearance, all of
it goes down. Each month there is a
check on buying, and a comparison is
made between profit margins of each
department. That is where it gets really
tough. Then, once a year, you have to
go before the heads of the store and
justify your buying for 12 months. That
can be really nerve-racking.”
For young people like this (both
Harris and Miss Allsop are in their
early twenties), the pressure as buyers
is naturally very severe, and buying is
the central task of a retail trainee
executive. As Margaret Allsop said:
“You have to learn to buy competi-
tively, hard and fast. You have to keep
abreast of fashion. Or ahead of it. And
never forget that buyers in other de-
partments are looking over your shoul-
der. Your behaviour mustn’t vary from
day to day, no matter how you are
feeling.”
Often there are four evenings a week
of study. Harris said: “I live for my
job every minute, apart from sporting
activities. I find when I read the papers
I tend to look at the D.J. advertise-
ments first to see if we’ve got every-
thing in stock we’re advertising. And I
tend to spend much of what little time
play-acting discussion group-type semi-
nars also prove useful.”
Some companies induct their trainee
executives into private ceremonies of
an almost Masonic solemnity. At
National Cash Register, a man going
up the sales ladder may find that at a
regular convention, in which various
members of the company are incited
to compete with each other in the
selling of machines, company songs are
sung. Variants of famous items like
“Little Brown Jug” or the “Marines’
Hymn” are turned into crowd-rousing
anthems or hate songs a “hate-
Melbourne” song, say, designed to make
Sydney salesmen beat their Melbourne
competitors hollow. The contests have
various themes horse-racing, with
the salesmen dressed up as jockeys, the
Olympics, or mountain-climbing, with
everyone rigged up in appropriate gear.
At the opposite extreme from this
kind of thing is the rather Orwellian
“sensitivity training” device used for
some young executives struggling up
the company ladder and introduced
here by John Wyndham, a psychologist
and management consultant. Known as
the “T-group,” a number of trainees
will sit in a circle with a psychologist
present, analyse themselves and each
other on the basis of a “Johari
window.” The Johari window or “area
of self-knowledge” it draws its
name from the fact that it was designed
With DJ/s 24 hours a day
I have looking at other stores to com-
pare them with ours. You’re really with
D.J’s 24 hours a day, you see.”
But the young man who works in
industry and does his technical college
course or economics degree or account-
ancy qualifications at night is also “at
work” 24 hours a day. Company
trainees like Harris and Miss Allsop are
getting their sort of qualifications in
the same “after hours” way. It helps
give a sense of significance to what is,
in many instances, a dull and unimpres-
sive role.
Total involvement with the company,
together with a gradual absorption of
personal identity, is usual in the larger
industrial business field as well. The
illusion that keeps young people of
ambition “going” in that field as in
retail work is that they are fully
occupying the traditional male role:
making decisions. But, in fact, they
seldom are; they are often only
nominally “executives” at all.
As Ray Barker of John P. Young
said: “Most companies get by with a
very few decision-makers at the top
of the pyramid. Whatever they may
think, the younger executives further
down are not making orders but simply
conveying them with minor variations
down from the top. Psychological tests
of personality at the beginning and
later are designed to show whether a
man has the ability to reconstruct and
pass along orders. Here is where the
by two psychologists known as Joe and
Harry is conceived as a box drawn
into four panels thus:
(1) FREE
(2) RESTRICTED
(3) BLINDSPOTS
(4) DARK AREAS
The “free” area is what you already
know about yourself, and can discuss
freely; the hidden area is that part of
your mind which you know about but
others don’t; the third part is that
which others can see in you but you
can’t; and the fourth is the really
blanketed area which is unknown to
you and others and only a practised
psychiatrist can uncover,
The “sensitivity” group analyses the
first three sections, by examining what
happens in the room during a discus-
sion (“Here and Now”) and by dis-
cussing outside problems (“Then and
There”). Often, tempers are lost as
various members of the group struggle
for its leadership. The psychologist
present tries to bare each psyche in
turn until everyone present has a very
clear idea of what the others are really
like, and has become something of
an amateur psychologist himself when
the time comes to go back to the job
an< 3 confront human problems from
day to day.
“In-basket” devices are equally popu-
lar: for instance, in front of a panel
or group, a man may act out a soliloquy
or solo play more or less as follows:


An imaginary John Brown has just died,
leaving Joe Smith to take over his job
at a moment’s notice. Joe is here - on
a Sunday in the office, with 23 separate
items to deal with in his “in-basket.”
He has three hours to get through the
work which has to be dealt with at
once. A third of the way through the
pile there is a note from his secretary
saying she is going on holiday on Mon-
day. Further down there is a thick
technical report with a note attached:
“Dear Joe, welcome to the new assign-
ment. Would you please read this
report and give me a recommendation
on Monday morning.” Further down
still, a letter addressed to his predeces-
sor in a woman’s handwriting indi-

WHITE OR
BLUE SHIRT
eating that she was the boss’ wife and
had been having an affair with Joe’s
predecessor. Finally, the three hours are
up, and the group rigorously examine
“Joe’s” handling of the basket.
In other popular business games, a
group assembles and tries to sell each
other machinery or toys; or push its
own candidates for a job. In retail
stores like Woolworths, play-actors pre-
tend to be a manager and a supervisor
and act out situations that might crop
up regularly on the selling floor.
As a man moves from junior to
senior executive at any age between
his twenties and late thirties he
has already begun to take on a “com-
pany look.” He is not likely to have
read extensively, or to have been often,
if at all, to an art gallery or museum.
Of the several young executives I spoke
to in industry none took an interest
even in popular arts like films and TV.
Many seemed conscious of a funda-
mental contradiction in the nature of
their work: though they were supposed
to play “team sport” on the job as
businessmen, the business world was
severely competitive, and office politics
brutal; you had to pretend to be
everybody’s friend, but you still had to
push hard to get ahead. All these men
were already, in their twenties, steeped
in the company image, virtually inter-
changeable, thinking day and night of
the company and its problems. They
were mostly married or about to be,
and drove Falcons or Holdens,
Robert Christmas, of Shell, seemed
the perfect company man. When I saw-
him he wore a blue shirt, grey suit,
black leather shoes, a short-back-and-
sides haircut; his eyes were clear, blue,
and looked directly at me as I talked.
He did not fidget or interrupt, sat
straight upright in his chair, and his
voice never rose or fell beyond a
pleasant .medium pitch. He lives in a
flat and has been married for 12
months. He drives a Falcon, catches
the 7.45 train punctually every morn-
ing, and gets to work at 8.30. Two
nights a week he leaves the office at
5.20 and gets home between 6.15 and
6.30 (Hurlstone Park). The remaining
three nights a week he goes to Tech.,
getting home at 9.15 to 9.30. Week-
ends he helps with the fuelling of
Shell-sponsored cars in the Shell auto
races. Other weekends he usually plays
golf, and he always falls asleep while
watching TV or movies.
Not surprisingly, the social life of
young executives is a rather limited
one. Nearly all those I interviewed
said that apart from a drink after
work, and the sporting clubs, they sel-
dom had time to go out socially; com-
pared with Americans they seem house-
bound, and didn’t exchange visits
among colleagues at each others’ homes
in the way that one hears is common-
place in the United States.
Social activities had, however, been
organised quite briskly by the Junior
Chamber of Commerce, an organisa-
tion affiliated to the Junior Chamber
International, which seemed designed
to extend a company man’s way of
life to a total involvement with similar
young people away from business as
well as in it. A brochure issued by
the Chamber gives a guide to activities,
combining socialising with business
thinking; in addition to off-the-job
seminars with people taking part in
fake business dramas or an elaborate
skit on Parliamentary behaviour with
a fake chairman, instructor, and sec-
onder, there are chapter meetings,
studies of “how to make speeches,”
and a high-powered “activation of
members process” in which new people
are inducted into a variety of vigorous
team-playing gimmicks. There is a
“Spark Plug” program devised as a
“challenge to remain active” to all
members who have passed their first
year of membership.
Looking at the future, it is hard not
to feel that much of Australian business
is going to be stuck with a large num-
ber of totally conformist, interchange-
able, smooth company men at the top
in a few years (although the toughest
may in so,me firms survive the levelling
process and make their own rules). In
America, the present movement is said
to be away from too much conformism,
to a more careful look at the non-
conformist graduate when hiring and
a greater concern with originality. But
here we are adopting the most extrava-
gant methods of the American heyday
of psychological testing and re-testing.
By the time he has passed the initial
interviews, the aptitude and psycho-
logical tests, the discussion group
hurdles, the sensitivity training quag-
mire, the anagram games and the in-
basket test, the long-distance runner in
the executive race will be thoroughly
processed by a company, ready to play
a safe hand for the rest of his days.
Thirty years fro,m his first appoint-
ment, the school all-rounder has become
nothing more than a precisely function-
ing cog in a company wheel, with a
clean desk, a clean face, a house
in the suburbs, a wife, children, and
ahead of him a superannuation policy
and a satisfactory funeral. And in the
meantime, if you’re wanting to be a
junior executive and you’re a bearded,
long-haired, pebble-glassed, non-sports-
playing homosexual heavy drinker
keep out.




Non-news is good news in Sydney
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
“TOGETHERNESS, toget herne
there should be more togetherness
A sentiment shared by the Sydn
“Daily Mirror.” Prince Charles, yo
see, went to a show with a girl. B
not only that. According to the “M
ror’s” trembling reporters, “They we
photographed together. They drove
the Prince’s car together. The audien
at the theatre saw them together.”
The warm, human interest of it. Anc
they have been corresponding as we
for five years, the “Mirror” says,
circumstance which adds some interest
to the royal image. He is 18 and sh
is 27, which means they started whe
she was 22 and he was 13.
Sydney afternoon journalism is re
nowned for its screaming posters anc
shouting headlines; the little adde
details are too often overlooked. “Sh
is known to have corresponded regu
larly with Prince Charles for fiv
years.” You don’t get enough of tha
kind of background information i
papers in the other States.
Not that Sydney can pull it off ai
the time. On the same day that th
Mirror’s” imaginative reporters wer
offering the stories behind the news
their competitors down at the “The
Sun” were having a more sober day
“We’re sorry,” lamented “The Sun’s’
front page, “but not all the news to
day is as bright as the weather.’
There followed a summary list of the
day’s unexciting news. The fifth-
ranking event of the day was the
announcement: “The price of oysters
will go up on Anzac Day.”
The previous day “The Sun” had
rather the better of the “Mirror” ir
the front-page battle. Whereas the
latter split its front page vertically,
‘ McGooley TV star in agony” and
“Unwanted Babies,” with the largest
words only one and a half inches high,
“The Sun” occupied three-quarters of
the page with the declaration:
“Vietnam Invasion Fears.”
The “Mirror” rose to the same type-
size in concern about Vietnam the
next day. “Russia Steps In” it coun-
tered, and “The Sun’s” effort of “All
Buses May Stop ’ looked a bit weak.
Fortunately for Sydney the buses did
not stop and more fortunately for the
world Russia trod with a light footfall,
her stepping -in consisting of more
promises, some threats, and an appeal
to other Communist States for wider
aid for the fighting Vietnamese people.
I don’t want to suggest that there is
such a thing as a credibility gap between
the Sydney afternoon front pages and
their readers, but rather to suggest
that a lot of the afternoon reporting is
of non-news. Buses that may stop are
apt to get themselves into print more
often than buses that do stop; Vietnam
invasion fears are more often reported
than Vietnam invasions; the Pope is
expected to say no more frequently
than he says both yes and no; suburbs
aie less often blown up by leaking gas
than threatened by it.
To amend the old saying: non-news
is good news on a Sydney afternoon.
The finest case, of course, occurred
when “The Sun” bought the rights to
William Manchester’s “The Death of a
President and began to prepare its
eager public for this scoop with a
flood of anticipatory adjectives.
The “Mirror” rode with the gather-
ing wave and then dived ahead by run-
ning an edited version of the Warren
Commission Report a day before “The
Sun began with Manchester.
Kennedy Begins Today” read the
“Mirror” poster, and across it was
stamped the word “Official.” Despite
the expense of the Manchester pur-
chase The Sun” never seemed to
regain the lead. A day’s start and the
use of the world “Official” kept the
Mirror in front, as the posters ran
from “Kennedy The Real Story” to
“Kennedy Murder Official Free Lift-
out to “The Book Jackie Took to
Court” to “Kennedy Official” to
“Kennedy’s Assassin’s Strange Love
Life.”
It was a relief when the “Mirror”
returned to some hard news. The
next Monday’s poster: “Iron Bar Bash-
ing Hoodlum Rampage.”
The non-news technique is often a
most inexpensive way of running a
paper. A great deal of non-news gather-
ing can be done by one reporter over
one telephone. What the reporter does
is dieam up the most unlikely event
of the day: That the State Govern-
ment is going to start building next
week a 16-lane subway between Circu-
lar Quay and Manly, say, or some-
thing even more remote.
The reporter then phones the Pre-
mier, who denies that any such thing
is contemplated. The headline is easy
to imagine: “Quay-Manly Subway
Delay.” The possibilities of this tech-
nique imagine the questions which
could be asked of bishops, governors,
headmasters, and generals have not
been fully explored: “Bishop denies
. . ~” “General says no war yet with
35
Given the amount of non-news, the
misleading posters and headlines,
the daily skelter of sex and sensation, jt
may be surprising that the afternoon
papers sell as many as they do, a
combined 600,000 almost. Not everyone
is much interested in beat-up head-
lines, cheesecake, and scandal, but
those are not the only things offered.
Despite the “beat-ups” the “Mirror”
and “The Sun” also manage to pro-
duce some very good pieces of daily
reporting. Behind the slick and sensa-
tion-hungry sub-editors are hidden a
number of competent roundsmen and
reporters.
There is Ron Saw, the “Mirror’s”
columnist, with his teeming fund of
middle-level metaphor, a completely ex-
posed nervous system, and emotions that
translate automatically into journalistic
prose: the only man in Australia who
bleeds ink, and the best columnist of his
kind around.
The skill of Saw as a columnist and
Rigby as a cartoonist are matched by
the “Mirror’s” appealing tautness in
layout and design. “The Sun” is not far
behind, but it should be recorded that
the “Mirror” has complained, perhaps
with some justification, that “The Sun”
has copied its redesigned front page
and masthead.
Over the past few years it has become
evident that the “Mirror” mostly sets
the pace and “The Sun” follows. Apart
from design, “The Sun” has tend-
ed to follow “Mirror” methods with
columnists, with the daily TV com-
mentary, even down to running a simi-
lar football competition. When the
“Mirror” got former model Maggie
Tabberer to write a fashion column,
“The Sun” asked model Del Hancock
to do one for them.
The “Mirror’s” edge in initiative is
now measured by its edge in circulation.
For about six months it has been boast-
ing across the top of its front page:
“Largest Afternoon Sales In N.S.W.” In
September, 1965, “The Sun” was
slightly ahead with an average net cir-
culation of 293,000 compared to its
opponent’s 290,000. But whereas “The
Sun’s” circulation remained much the
same, the “Mirror” had climbed to the
figure of 305,000 at the last official
count.
The circulation figures could he
misleading. They do not tell how many
people buy both papers, nor how many
of each are shunted off to remote
country areas and sold more or less
under subsidy. “The Sun” is now in
some danger. Both papers do the same
things, but the “Mirror” does them
slightly better; if the “Mirror” keeps
this up it may increase its lead and
begin to capture the larger share of
the advertising, a market extremely
sensitive to circulation changes; more
advertising for one means the loss of
advertising for the other, and since
both gain most of their revenue from
adverts, the loser faces economic prob-
lems.
Overseas experience has shown that
this process can accelerate quickly in a
situation where two papers of a similar
kind are fighting for the same market.
In some European and American cities
the weaker has gone to the wall in
such circumstances. The situations of
“The Sydney Morning Herald” and the
“Telegraph” in Sydney and of the
“Sun-Pictorial” and “The Age” in
Melbourne are not comparable. They
are different kinds of papers and
depend to some extent on different
kinds of advertising. On the other
hand, “The Sun” and the “Mirror” are
so alike in most respects that it may
be unrealistic for either to plan for
ultimate victory. The one, a bit down
on numbers can, after all, just keep
copying successfully.
The fiercest battle is for street sales
in the City, and for factory workers on
their way home. Hence the poster
clamor, the bold heads, and the gim-
mickry. The afternoon papers are not
edited to be read and thought about,
but to be skimmed through and thrown
away. They aim to provide easy enter-
tainment and fast news: as some put
it, they want the response “Gee whiz!”
rather than “ ’mmm, I see.”
Surrendering to the task by being
brash, prevaricating, and meretricious
may not be the best solution to their
problem and it may not be the only
one which will work, but it has been
proven to succeed.
Until some editor or management of
genius composes a different formula,
most of us will not weep to think
that most copies of “The Sun” and
the “Mirror” are eventually destined
for fish and chip shops or worse fates.


Back to the
battling
KYLIE TENNANT, that bright-eyed
woman who still has the honest
enthusiasm for writing that streams
from the pages of her early books, has
escaped from the weight of other
people’s words to get on with her own.
As an editor and literary adviser for
Macmillan and Co., she has for years
spent her time reading and working
over other people’s books, a waste of
talent which suggests her publishers
are a short-sighted firm. This year the
writer herself is getting a word in
edgeways. Two books will appear
“Ma Jones and the Little White
Cannibals” from Macmillans in July,
and a little later “Tell Morning This”
will emerge from Angus and Robert-
sons; though it was written 15 years
ago, this will be the first full publica-
tion. The 200,000-word novel was cut
by one-third and appeared as “The
Joyful Condemned” in 1953.
If Margaret Dick, who wrote “The
Novels of Kylie Tennant” (Rigby,
1966), had not read the full volume
during her research it might never
have appeared. “Now they won’t let
me get my hands on it,” Kylie Ten-
nant said. “They won’t let me change
a word.” Dealing with the problems
of delinquents and conscientious ob-
jectors in World War 11, it should still
have social meaning.
Ma Jones is a different tale entirely.
It began when she had a week in
hospital and found time to write a
short story. Later, she occasionally
snatched time to write another. They
are all, according to the author, farci-
cal and embroidered with humorous
anecdotes.
Though she takes her work for Aus-
tralian writing very seriously (she is
on the Advisory Board of the Com-
monwealth Literary Fund) and she
appears to have something of a salon
atmosphere in her home at Hunters
Hill (Patrick White had just rung off
and the Australian National University
was on the line when I arrived), the
urge to get back to full-time writing
has become too strong to ignore and
she is now working hard on a biog-
raphy of Dr. Evatt.
She writes in a corner of her bed-
room. The desk is piled with great
scrap books, legal documents, note-
books filled with her own research, and
tapes made at Canberra.
“The Evatt family has been very
helpful,” she said. “In the end it will
be a united effort which is necessary,
since Evatt seems to have lived about
twenty lives. His widow, Mary Alice,
has given me some wonderful material.
Clive Evatt is helping with important
legal decisions and Phil Evatt, a
nephew, is also going to help sort out
papers.”
Kylie Tennant feels strongly on the
subject of The Doc, and is particularly
keen to separate the man from his
career. “There is a certain amount of
criticism beginning to creep into news-
papers now,” she said. “It may be cor-
rect, but someone else can write the
political history and his era; I think he
was too great an Australian to be left
unchronicled.”
Kylie Tennant has always wanted to
get to the heart of the matter. Her
early research into backgrounds for
books like “The Battlers,” “Foveaux,”
and “Tell Morning This” made her
name legendary for a certain mad cour-
age that took her into brothels, bars,
and jails to get material for her novels.
“It was a sort of social research I
suppose,” she said. “I have always
By APRIL HERSEY
been fascinated by ecology, and I want
to tell people about society. We have no
society as such in Australia, no clear-
cut class structure but there are so
many sets of values that you can liter-
ally fall off one set and into another in
the distance between two streets in a
suburb. By going there, working there,
seeing the world through other people’s
eyes you can see what is important to
them and what is not. This fascinates
me.”
In her adventurous years travelling
the roads with itinerant workers and
honey gipsies and chatting with crimi-
nals she came to no harm. “No one will
hurt you,” she says with supreme con-
fidence. “I guarantee I can walk down
any street, no matter how notorious,
and come out unscathed. I’m the type
that finds the fire has been put out.
Criminals have always been particularly
nice, called me ‘love’ and have
generally been rather patronising.”
Experience in her editing work for
Macmillans has shown her that the
present crop of writers is not so con-
cerned with getting down to basic
facts. “Like a friendly old dog with a
bone I keep suggesting that someone
should research the waterfront of Syd-
ney,” she said. “I lay my b.one at their
feet, tell them to work there, take
notes. No one ever picks up my offer-
ing. But truth has a different ring
if they only knew.”
Kylie Tennant describes herself now
Kylie Tennant
as “safe and neat in the middle
classes” and enjoys cleaning her house
and being a “proud mother” to Beni-
son (21), now on a station property
in Western Queensland painting, and
Bim (15), whose room is filled with
guitars and Bob Dylan records.
However, she cannot be considered
too settled. When President Johnson
was in Sydney she received a call from
a most responsible civic-minded friend
called Maud, who asked her if she
would like to protest. Kylie said she
would, but it might stir up her
arthritis. Bim called out from his room
that he would protest for her. No, said
her friend, this protest required
women wearing black clothes and
veils.
The veils shook Kylie, but she
promised to try to be there, and in
turn asked fellow novelist Elizabeth
Harrower if she would like to protest,
too. So finally they all assembled, with
and without veils. Miss Harrower had
a small sign reading SUPPORT THE
UNITED NATIONS. Kylie Tennant
had a larger one, supplied by Bim,
which said STOP VIETNAM WAR.
Another publishing friend had one so
large that one person could not carry
it. It began “I am an American
citizen” and the writers concluded it
was his autobiography.
The latter-day rebels waited close
beside the Mormon Choir, which was
lustily singing “The Yellow Rose of
Texas” (until some nearby suspected
Communists disconnected the equip-
ment with special wire cutters, an act
that distressed Kylie Tennant, who did
not consider this sporting). When the
entourage swept past they saw nothing
but banners.
And Kylie Tennant and Elizabeth
Harrower, after dashing off to the
Art Gallery to register further dis-
approval, finished up sitting on their
placards in the park having coffee and
sandwiches.
Subsequently Kylie’s sore throat,
which was assumed to be from shout-
ing, turned out to be scarlet fever. “So
I’ll just have to write from now on,”
she said.

What is there to alienate from?
Charles Higham talked to
Kenneth Rexroth, celebrated 61-
year-old precursor of the Beat poets
of San Francisco through his free-
wheeling dynamic free-verse,
currently columnist of “The Satur-
day Review” and the San Francisco
“Examiner,” here last week on a
private visit to Australia.
KENNETH REXROTH, here briefly
last week on a round-the-world ticket,
wore a flowing, blue-spotted cravat, a
tartan waistcoat, and, in his sixties, the
grizzled moustachioed look of an
elderly American character actor. Once
the most famous of San Franciscan
poets before the Beats, he retains a
column in the San Francisco
“Examiner” and what he calls a
“relentlessly highbrow” radio program
on literature on Radio KPFA.
Of Australian poets, he said that only
Judith Wright and A.D. Hope have
been heard of in America. “A.D.
Hope’s book . . . was that published by
Viking Press? I wonder how that was
put through? By Malcolm Cowley, per-
haps!” (Their recently retired chief
editor and a famous critic.) “Maybe
Hope met him in Paris? Or was it New
York? Hope? He resembles someone
like Henley, a minor Edwardian or
late Victorian non-decadent or anti-
decadent. I suppose if you wrote such
A. D. Hope ... magazine fillers
things in America people would burst
out laughing. Of course it is better than
much of Henley’s, Henley wrote a lot
of drivel, all that muscular Nietz-
scheism. But Hope’s is the sort of thing
they use in America as magazine fillers.
The sort of stuff they put in ‘Harpers’
Magazine,’ to fill up the rest of the
sheet when there is no advertisement.”
“Judith Wright? She is less anachro-
nistic than Hope. Insofar as she is a
Georgian poet, not an Edwardian or a
Victorian. We do not have an Ameri-
can woman poet just like that, like
Witter Bynner only better.
“Of course, in Australia you have a
homogeneous society, with a largely
classless and very dense structure, so
you don’t get the literature of aliena-
tion. What is there to alienate from?
If some Paris intellectual came to chop
into your structure it would just close
behind the sword. It is a low-pressure
Utopia here. You don’t get a Baude-
laire or a Stendhal, and why should
you? Baudelaire was so nasty to that
woman and she wasn’t even a Negress.”
Turning to American poetry, Mr.
Rexroth pointed out that poets in
America nowadays have money and
some of them boast about it like busi-
nessmen. “Look at John Ciardi. He
makes twice as much even as James
Dickey. For one reading he gets $l5OO.
He is booked through an agent. He
works only two or three months a
year. All you have to do in America
now is wait for the mail and telephone
calls to make a living—once you have
a reputation. For one tour of the
southern part of Southern Michigan
you can make $5OO a week after
deducting expenses.
“People like Ferlinghetti and Gins-
berg everybody who is under 25
goes to see them. Nowadays we’ve got
the democratisation of poetry. You can
get a free broadsheet poem in a but-
cher’s shop. Of course, the old guard
is left behind. Young people regard
the ‘Hudson Review’ as an enemy.
‘The Kenyon Review’? I haven’t seen
a copy of it in time out of mind. It
doesn’t mean a thing. Well, some poets
do all right. Richard Wilbur is very
good on the guitar. Richard Eber-
hardt is thought well of because young
people think he is a Catholic anar-
chist. Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti have
sold a quarter of a million books in
America as against people of an earlier
generation who haven’t sold that many
between them.
“Of course, there are certain dis-
advantages in all this democratisation
of the arts. Junk sculpture and neo-
Dada. Anybody can do it. But you
are going to get a situation eventuating
when artists will be diffused throughout
the whole population. It will be like
Chinese society in a period like the
Sung dynasty when to get a job as a
postman you had to write a fairly good
poem.”
Mr. Rexroth dismissed Yevtushenko
(“a nasty jet-set character”). “Of
course, if you attack him here (and
you say you did) people will accuse
you of being anti-Bolshevik, whereas
in Russia he might not be regarded
as acceptable at all.”
Mr. Rexroth’s last trip had been to
London, where he had scarcely found
a hint of literary world of the ’forties
of which he had been so much a part
when published in Wrey Gardiner’s
long vanished “Poetry Quarterly” and
Tambimuttu’s “Poetry London.” Gard-
iner, he said, was very ill on bad wine,
and ran a boarding-house; Tambi was
practically a beggar in New York.
For British poetry since, Rexroth
Judith Wright ... less anachronistic
had little time; and he dismissed off-
hand “Swinging London.” “You go to
the Roundhouse, that’s ‘in’ at the
moment. It’s so amateurish. People
think they are having a psychedelic
experience. The band doesn’t turn up.
Sheets of metal fall down with a
clatter. Awful. And everybody goes
there. The Honorable Ormsby Gore,
everybody. It’s all so bourgeois.
“Here in Sydney at least everything
is honestly working-class. Everybody is
having a much better time than similar
people in the Portobello Road. Of
course, this is still the one place left
in the world where they ask you why
you came here.”


OVERSEAS
Paradise not around the corner:
Indonesia without Sukarno
THE POLITICAL LULL which set
in in Indonesia, after the momentous
People’s Congress decision to strip
President Sukarno of his title, now
seems to be coming to an end. Sukarno,
of course, is still confined to his palaces
and is receiving no red carpet treat-
ment. He may even have to leave the
Merdeka Palace this month.
It is a dull life for Sukarno, even
though he has the company of his
children by his first wife, Ibu Fat-
mawati. His health is probably better
than is usually thought. What must
hurt him most is the fact that the
Indonesian Press is ignoring him alto-
gether. No Konfrontasi, no smashing
of Nekolim. The last small sensation
he had to offer the public was the
disclosure of his divorce from Haryati,
his fourth wife after Fatmawati, Har-
tini, and Dewi (as far as one can
ascertain). The divorce was apparently
considered necessary to avoid condem-
nation by the Ministry of Religious
Affairs for having married (i.e. regis-
tered) more than four wives the
maximum allowed under Islamic law.
Sukarno, now 65, has meanwhile mar-
ried the 21-year-old Jurike Sanger,
usually known as Juriwati.
However, Sukarno and his wives no
longer dominate the Indonesian scene.
Other, more compelling, issues are
attracting attention now. First and
foremost is the economic situation.
The Government has at last embarked
on a sensible, realistic program of
stabilisation. After the basic policy
statements by high-ranking officials in
April last year, major action had to
be delayed for months on end because
of the lingering political uncertainties
and the dualism in the national leader-
ship. It was only in the last quarter of
1966 that concrete measures could be
taken.
The stabilisation plan, launched last
October, is based on the following
principles:
• Balanced Budgets (through intensi-
fied tax collection and cuts in Govern-
ment spending).
• Foreign exchange reforms to im-
prove the trade balance and Govern-
ment revenues.
• Limitation of bank credit.
• Ending of subsidies and restrictive
controls on State enterprises, in order
to improve their performance.
• Creation of a favorable climate for
foreign investment, through the
Foreign Investment Law.
Hard-hitting stabilisation measures
have already strengthened the inter-
national market value of the Rupiah.
It has not proved possible to close the
long-standing gap between the official
rate of exchange and the free market
rate, but it has been narrowed consider-
ably. On the other hand, much criticism
has been directed at the slowing-up of
business activity caused by the tight
money policy particularly in the
import sector.
It seems that the Indonesian
economy has now been saved from col-
lapse. Efforts to obtain rescheduling of
foreign debts have achieved encourag-
ing results, and new credits have been
offered. Production of food crops in
1966 was below the target set, but in
most cases it was better than in 1965.
With better planning and less freakish
weather, agricultural production should
rise in 1967.
What does this mean to the com-
mon man, however? He is certainly not
starving (but neither was he starving
in the Sukarno era). There are no sen-
A Far Eastern
Economic Review Report
From O. G. Roeder
sational improvements in living stand-
ards for urban wage earners to date.
The difficulty of earning a living can
be seen from the cost-of-living index.
During January this year the index
rose by a further 10 percent or so,
according to Professor Widjojo, one
of Acting President Suharto’s outstand-
ing economic advisers. Another noted
economist, Professor Emil Salim, has
recently stated that “the price increases
that have occurred during the first
quarter of 1967 have been mainly due
to psychological factors.” Mr. Salim is
certainly right in saying that Indo-
nesia might well be regarded as a kind
of “economic laboratory” in which
various economic ills can be researched.
He further emphasised that the infla-
tion rate had reached the incredible
General Suharto
level of 1000 percent per year between
1960 and 1966. The rate has been
fluctuating around 20 percent a month
since the beginning of this year.
It remains to be seen how far price
stabilisation can be achieved after the
solution of the inflation problems and
the creation of a better psychological
climate. The long - awaited spirit of
honesty and realism in the Administra-
tion is at last being demonstrated. The
energetic Commander of the West Java
Siliwangi Division, Major General
Dharsono, bluntly told an audience in
Banten: “Indonesians have to accord
more esteem to the builder of a small
bamboo bridge than to someone who
is dreaming of a giant concrete bridge
stretching for tens of kilometres.” (He
might also have mentioned the osten-
tatious super project for the Trans-
Sumatra Highway, which is still being
dreamed about by some planners.)
Though economics is now trumps,
there are some political cards in the
post-Sukarno game, too. The national
election planned for next year is
already casting its shadow. A new
election law is under discussion in the
House of Representatives. One difficult
question to be answered is: Who will
be allowed to participate in the elec-
tions? Members of the outlawed Com-
munist Party and all its affiliates are
expected to be banned from voting
because “anti-democratic people can-
not be allowed to take part in the
formation, maintenance, and defence
of democracy.”
There is also the'' problem of the
legal rehabilitation of the once-


powerful Moslem Masjumi Party and
the Democratic Socialist Party (PSI),
both of which were banned by Sukarno
in 1960. The former Masjumi General
Chairman, Prawoto Mangkusasmito,
who was imprisoned without trial for
some four years, stated at the end of
March that “with patience and wisdom
in addition to democracy guaranteed
by the Government, understanding
would be reached toward the rehabili-
tation of the Party.”
Understandably enough, existing
political parties are not enthusiastic
about the rehabilitation of banned
parties. In this context, even some
form of “rehabilitation” for Bung
Karno is under discussion though
in a more negative vein. According to
the newspaper “Pelopor Baru,” Mr.
Malik recently stated that, in accord-
ance with the decision of the People's
Congress, Bung Karno would not be
eligible to stand at the coming general
elections, since there are still matters
concerning him which should be settled
first, and the Government has been
empowered by the Congress to investi-
gate him. Mr. Malik remarked further
that Bung Karno was banned from
engaging in political activity until the
next general elections.
The main problem, however, does
not seem to be competition among
political parties but rather the
relationship between the parties and
the Armed Forces in political matters.
What this comes down to is the ques-
tion of the future role of the military
in Indonesian politics. The Indonesian
Armed Forces have taken part in the
political struggle ever since they were
set up, and it goes without saying that
the victory of the New Order could
never have been achieved without their
resolute backing, particularly that of
the Army. Rumors have it that the
Armed Forces will insist on getting 25
percent of the seats in the general
elections next year. However, K. H.
Dahlan, Deputy Chairman of the Mos-
lem Nahdatul Ulama Party and an
outstanding New Order figure, said
recently that his party was not in favor
of Armed Forces participation in the
elections—though he did say that mem-
bers of the Armed Forces could be
elected when representing mass organi-
sations or functional groups.
General Suharto has repeatedly made
clear that he is opposed to any form
of military dictatorship. His own sin-
cerity was demonstrated recently by
his consent to anti-corruption interro-
gations of high-ranking military men by
a joint Armed Forces Board. (One
source even said General Suharto had
himself ordered these interrogations.)
Corrupt officials belong to the legacy
of the Sukarno era. Sad though this
may be, if the new leaders really act
to wipe out corruption they will im-
prove the Government’s position consid-
erably. This could help to overcome
some of the problems being encountered
now. Even the continuing rumors of
another reshuffle of the Ampera Cab-
inet make sense if understood as a
means of ousting inefficient, if not cor-
rupt, personnel anu bringing in more
honorable men who know the job bet-
ter.
Indonesia’s many problems have not
diminished in the post-Sukarno era.
Paradise is not just around the corner.
What has changed is the approach to
these problems.
Common Market
Britain's initiative
IT NOW SEEMS that, barring any
slip in the Cabinet or the Labor
Party, the British bid to join Europe
will be lodged in the week beginning
May 7. Since Mr. Wilson is in charge,
it is unlikely that there will be any
slip. The Labor Party will talk itself
out: as the Left Wing does not believe
that Britain will actually manage to
get in, it will not talk itself into the
last ditch with Mr. Emanuel Shinwell.
Mr. Douglas Jay ,may talk himself out
of the Cabinet, but he is the last
man to lead a real guerilla campaign
from the back benches. Of all his
internal oppositions, the anti-European
one worries Mr. Wilson least. At home
his hands are free to renew, in his
own name, the most important British
political initiative of the decade.
His hands are pretty free, too, so far
as the United States is concerned. The
Johnson Administration is ready to see
Mr. Wilson do a deal with President
de Gaulle. Not any kind of a deal,
of course. The Americans would be
surprised if it involved the dissociation
of Britain from the Vietnam war, or
from NATO: if that happened, the sur-
prise would be less at the damage to
American policy than at the damage
to Mr. Wilson’s own political credi-
bility. But many other things could be
absorbed in Washington, even a limited
British devaluation. Many other people
would put up with much, too, to see
Britain in Europe. The Soviet Union,
which still expects to find Herr Strauss
at the top of the West German
Government one day, is more amen-
able than before to a direct British
influence in Europe. The less-developed
countries, even those, such as the Latin
Americans, who have no hope of a
ride into Europe on British coat-tails,
affect to believe that British entry will
eventually help to wean Europe away
from the protectionism that has
jeopardised the Kennedy round of trade
talks. Europe as it is now is not a
popular place in the world. The most
popular thing, outside Europe, would
be for Mr. Wilson to try to join it.
This may be all the more reason for
President de Gaulle to try to block
him; or, if not to block direct, to offer
something, such as association, which
Mr. Wilson has aiready rejected. Per-
haps this is what will come from the
Rome meeting. De Gaulle does not
want Britain in Europe simply as the
Trojan horse of the Americans: that
was what went wrong in 1963. If
President de Gaulle does come to
accept Britain in Europe now it will
be as his own Trojan horse against
the Europeans.
President de Gaulle has made no
secret of his conviction that, if the com-
mon market had not existed before he
returned to power in 1958, he would
never have allowed it to come into
being. It has taken him some years,
but he has now almost put the com-
mission in Brussels into cold storage. No
single action of his could confirm this
success more permanently than the
addition of a Wilsonian Britain to what
is coming to be, to outside eyes, little
more than a European customs union.
Britain’s admission would be the end
of the United States of Europe for the
foreseeable future. What is more and
the irony of it may be attractive, too—
the Congress of the United States of
America, so long accustomed to the idea
of accepting almost anything to get
Britain into Europe, would have little
option but to bless such a union, how-
ever barren of supranational hopes it
had become.
No doubt President de Gaulle would
ideally prefer a Europe of the six alone,
which France could lead, to a Europe
which contained Britain and probably
Denmark as well. (He seems to have
set his face definitively against other
Scandinavians.) But the time is
approaching when so convinced a
nationalist as the General has now to
consider the fate of France when he
has gone. The thought cannot be absent
from his mind that a France without
him may one day be hard pressed to
contain a Germany with Herr Strauss.
This, again, is where Britain comes in.
It is an option for him that has greater
attractions in 1967 than it did in 1963.
But President de Gaulle may still be
inclined to reject it. He may still believe
that Britain, and Mr. Wilson, are not in
earnest. Or that Britain is still no more
than the instrument, willing or helpless,
of American policy. He may even ex-
pect, if he is singularly ill-informed,
that after he has shut Britain out Presi-
dent Johnson and Mr. Wilson will
gratefully embrace each other in a
North Atlantic trading area. It is, how-
ever, hard these days to find people
who matter in Washington who believe
that either the Administration or Con-
gress can be readily led to such a North
Atlantic alternative. The practical alter-
native is that Britain should make it
clear that it will continue to grapple
with Europe, that it will not go away.
This is the policy of besieging Europe.
If President de Gaulle can be disabused
of any idea that the British problem
can be made to disappear the advant-
ages to France that British membership
would bring may come to loom even
larger than they have.


BOAC are a bunch
of armchair theorists.
Even at 600 miles per hour, 12,000 mile
comfort still largely depends on a personal
adjustment between the airline seat and the
individual human frame.
The answer is the BOAC exclusive economy
class seat! Its theory is very simple:
It fits you. You don’t have to fit it. This is
how it works. A space-saving moulded plastic
shell is covered with squishy-soft synthetic
foam that supports you where you tend to
feel a trip most. And the seat in front has
a recessed back,allowing more stretch room.
The armchair is on all BOAC flights from
Australia. 7 a week through India. And now
3 a week East through the USA.
For no extra fare you can become an arm-
chair traveller. Sit out your next trip in one.
Just for the heaven of it.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Sculthorpe’s taste of money
By DAVID SALTER
“YES, REALLY, DOUGH, it’s the big
thing,” and with typical exaggeration
Peter Seulthorpe warms to his favorite
general observation of the American
arts and academic climate. Money,
the comfort an abundance brings, and
the role it can play in university
activities seem to have dominated his
year-long stay at Yale as Composer
in Residence under the Harkness
Fellowship scheme. Campus administra-
tion is phenomenally big business; the
whole system rests on the financial
pedestal of perpetual grants, trusts,
fellowships, scholarships, foundations,
endowments, and plain, ordinary
money.
When we talked last week in his
small Woollahra home it became evi-
dent that Sculthorpe’s life among the
chequebooks had been as expensive as
it was enjoyable. Despite the handsome
provisions of the Harkness Fellowship
he was forced to sell his sports car, left
in Australia, in order to survive his
last few months.
As is becoming the case here, a
large number of America’s composers
and writers have retreated to the
academic bomb shelter. Most are lec-
turers in their particular field, but some,
especially the better-known writers,
have taken posts at the head of a
college. This, like many American
university trends, is a conscious aping
of British tradition. To Seulthorpe,
who spent some time at Oxford dur-
ing the early ’fifties, this imitation of
anything European seemed more
obsession than respect for history.
One college at Yale seemed to
him typical of campus buildings in
its combination of architectural styles.
The greater part of the college was
mock gothic while the courtyard and
secondary exposed sections were in
strict neo-colonial style. The library
at Yale is an even more ambitious
undertaking a complete replica of
a gothic cathedral with the books
carefully hidden in the catacombs.
Cost? Harkness himself built almost
the entire university as a “donation.”
But the vast resources of American
universities are not always wisely spent.
Yale’s School of Music spends fortunes
®n its collection of harpsichords and
deliberately overlooks a dusty box in
the library which contains in manu-
script the bulk of Charles Ives’ com-
positions. During his stay, Seulthorpe
persuaded some students to undertake
the task of transcribing and annotating
this music, and the results should be
available by the end of the year.
And from what he saw and heard
outside the universities, neglect is the
fate of most local composition. Euro-
pean contemporary music enjoys
fanatical championship while all but a
few American composers would starve
if they chose to make their art their
sole source of income. Hence the
emergence of the academic in-group of
composers, led by Princeton’s Milton
Babbitt, whose mathsmusic works are
performed at universities, in splendid
auditoriums, but hardly anywhere else.
To Seulthorpe, much of this music is
just Old Vienna Revisited further
sterile complications of Schoenberg/
Webern, often computed and even per-
formed by the university’s resident
cl' i i n>nic device and as such h
Peter Seulthorpe
not particularly worthy of acclaim.
But, he says, there is a growing reper-
toire of valuable work which remains
unheard purely because it is Ameri-
can.
Fortunately, not all of America is as
heartless to the artist as are the fad-
filled disciples of the New York
avant-garde. Tucked away in New York
State is Yaddo, a bizarre yet godsent
refuge for the musician, writer, painter,
sculptor, and, in fact, any artist whose
work has been generally recognised.
Yaddo is an enormous estate com-
prising a palatial mansion, imported
ancient ruins, artificial lakes and
woods the complete millionaire’s
paradise. Once admitted by a super-
vision and selection board, the artist
may live and work in this idyllic com-
munity for two months or more free of
charge. Seulthorpe spent a period there
in a centrally heated cabin by the
lake and is already planning a return
visit.
Peter Seulthorpe has returned to
Australia a more widely recognised
composer than he was when he left.
He has resumed his post as senior
lecturer at the Sydney University Music
Department. His “Sun Music 4” will be
performed at Expo ’67 and Faber
Music in England have published
everything he has written since the
sixth String Quartet (1965). Now it is
back to teaching and more composing.
The relatively relaxed pace of Aus-
tralian academic life allows him to do
both. To him, Australia is the “last
paradise” and he hopes that it will stay
that way.
Television
Fair dinkum
By FRANK ROBERTS
A NEW STANDARD of comparison
came viewers’ way last week on ABC-
TV. In future, awful television drama
may be said to be as bad as “Kain,”
worse than “Kain,” or for the ultimate
add “bloody,” used in the script a
few score times, presumably so that
viewers in Britain, who also saw it last
week, would know it was fair dinkum
Orstralian. Save us from expatriate
playwrights such as Alan Poolman, who
marry some childish sense of what is
Australian to a more thorough idea
of how to write bad drama.
Not only did Poolman manage to
slander Australian cattlemen, Aborigi-
nal stockmen, the N.T. police, inland
missionaries, and even tribal natives
(making one doubt that he had ever
been west of the Blue Mountains or
east of the Swan). He also wrote a
script about a psychotic younger
brother who went mad with loneliness
and no sex and, finally, with malaria
contracted in, of all places, Korea. This
allowed him to rave on for 90 minutes
through an unplot as wild as anyone
could dream of. As Kain, Keith Michell
was less than unimpressive, matched
only by Alan White as his brother,
Rattler (were they even in the right
desert?). Someone named J. C. Devlin
was good as Scotty, a desert wanderer,


who seemed to be there only to tie up
loose ends of the drammer, which were
plenty.
What possessed BBC-TV and ABC-
TV to film it? Well, television people
have some weird ideas about the Out-
back, there’s no other explanation.
Let’s hope the British viewers took it
all at face value—as only a bad joke.
Ballet
Fantastic footwork
By JOHN CARGHER
Festival of Spain. Luisillo Spanish
Dance Theatre. Her Majestys, Mel-
bourne.
IT WAS THE FRENCH- and Italian-
based Russian tradition which produced
the perfect Spanish ballet, “The Three-
Cornered Hat.” Luisillo and his dancers
cannot hold a candle to Massine’s
masterpiece, but they have the decided
advantage of having been brought up
in the Spanish tradition. Therefore
Luisillo uses the foreign professionalism
of classical ballet training to enhance
the original instead of the vice versa we
are used to. (Massine’s ballet stands
on its own as the one example which
genuinely succeeds in merging the two
cultures.) The result has high enter-
tainment value which enables the com-
pany to play successful duets between
castanets and box office takings in
almost any country of the world.
The present program consists of five
ballets which ring about as many
changes as are possible within the
limited framework of the many Spanish
styles. The most successful is the “Fan-
tasia Gallega,” which is also the most
balletic, since Galician dancing is based
on barefoot (or soft shoe) routines
which call for many qualities which are
enhanced by the classical training these
dancers have obviously had. Alberto
Portillo, a new guest star with the com-
pany, is superb in this; his ballon must
be the envy of every ballet dancer who
sees him.
“Tu y yo” (nothing, not even “You
and I”, is translated for us) and the
concluding “Flamenco del Rocio” are
the genuine flamenco article with a high
professional gloss. These could hardly
be bettered, though to the non-initiated
both suffer from excessive length.
One can only marvel at the fan-
tastic footwork and flashing colors of
the Spain we have always imagined.
The genuine article could never have
this polish and clean precision. These
ballets are built around Luisillo, who
is still the foremost exponent of fast
footwork and powerful stamping. It’s
almost like watching Gene Krupa be-
laboring the drums, with a human being
attached to the' sticks instead of just a
pair of hands. Quite fantastic, but just
a little tiring after a while. In contrast,
Solera del Jerez is just as good but
adds an avalanche of personal magne-
tism and personality which make her
the undoubted hit of the evening. Lui-
sillo may be a perfect technician, she is
a star.
The other two ballets, which appear
in the first half, are commercial enter-
tainment pieces. “Capricho Espanol”
uses the Rimsky-Korsakoff music (“Cap-
riccio Espagnole”) and will appeal to
the unsophisticated only. The “Bolero”
of Ravel is another matter. This is a
tour de force in which Luisillo brilliantly
uses a line of dancers to build up
visually the mounting excitement of the
famous old war horse. Furthermore the
rhythmic foot-stamping which increases
with the tempo is so superbly disciplined
that one can forget the abysmal musici-
ans who are torturing the music in the
pit.
The costumes and decor are very
beautiful and the whole evening pro-
ceeds with precision and elan. This is
Luisillo’s third visit to Australia. The
enthusiasm of the audience well re-
warded with extended encores at the
end shows that it will be some time
before this company will play to the
empty houses to which Australian
managements are rapidly becoming
used.
Films
Lost dimension
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
A Man For All Seasons. Director, Fred
Zinneman.
NATURALLY, movies have to have a
commercial release somewhere in order
to qualify for Academy Awards, but
if they show any promise, their sub-
sequent showings are often held back
so the promoters can do the “Most
Honored Motion Picture Since Last
Year!” bit. All very easy to understand,
but it does mean that we in Australia
don’t see a film until it comes to us with
a fanfare of trumpets and practically
a motor-cycle escort. No matter how
hard you try to approach the thing
without bias, it’s hard not to feel let
down.
So it is with “A Man For All
Seasons.” It’s a good film, interesting,
stimulating, often beautiful to watch, to
be recommended unhesitatingly as well
worth seeing. But best film of the year?
Best performance of the year? Six
Oscars? No, I’m afraid not. Where is
the excitement of the stage play, one
of the most gripping theatrical experi-
ences I can remember?
Much of the diminishment of the play
must be laid to the door of Robert Bolt.
He himself adapted for the screen his
story of the martyrdom of Sir Thomas
More who, for his religious principles,
opposed the divorce of Henry VIII,
and his marriage to Anne Boleyn,
although he realised clearly that it
meant his own disgrace and possible
death. In his play, Bolt contrasted More
with the Common Man, an actor who
appeared in various small roles—house-
servant, boatman, jailer, headsman
a man whose earthy acceptance of life
threw into relief More’s rarefied moral
scruples. Bolt is quoted as saying that
he now finds the Common Man
character an unnecessary and stagy
device, but he did throw the whole play
into focus; his absence turns the screen-
play into nothing more than a record
of historical facts.
More’s moral scruples were his down-
fall, but highmindedness was not the
only dangerous state of mind in the
days of bluff King Hal: with the great-
est willingness to be untrue to his
beliefs, a man could still die on the
block simply by not being quick enough
at keeping up with the whims of a
capricious monarch. Bolt’s postlude
makes this clear, but one misses the
further implication of the play that,
despite all the soul-searching and the
jockeying for position at high level, in
the end only the Common Man, whose
only concern is with survival, endures.
A few of the Common Man’s lines
of dialogue have been left to the actors
who play his various parts, but since
More’s reactions to them have generally
been excised, they seem meaningless and
vaguely out of character.
Paul Scofield’s fine but rather chilly
performance makes More an intel-
lectual, almost a calculating martyr; his
only moment of human warmth comes
in the farewell to his wife (in which
he is immeasurably helped by Wendy
Hiller, surely one of today’s most under-
rated actresses). Of course, More, as
painted by Bolt, is an admirable but not
a very likable character, full of the
arrogance of the sincerely convinced.
“Because I believe it,” he says to a
friend who asks why he must act as
he does; then immediately corrects him-
self to “Because I believe it.”
Fred Zinneman in his direction has
generally succeeded in approaching his
subject in cinematic style: he hasn’t
translated a play to the screen with the
accuracy of Mike Nichols in “Virginia
Woolf,” but this is far away from the
deliberate, pedestrian staginess of
“Othello.” The outdoor scenes, mostly
along the Thames, have an airy, dreamy
lyricism, underscored by Ted Moore’s
beautiful photography; some of the in-
door sequences, however, revert to the
theatrical set-piece.
This is a satisfying film, literate,
visually handsome, beautifully acted; I
was constantly interested but never as
excited or involved by it as I was by
the local production of the play.


Off-stage star
By JOHN CARGHER
La Boheme. Producer, Franco Zeffirelli.
SINCE the still-born Sydney Opera
House will not now be able to bring
us full-scale imported opera companies,
the Australian release of the famous
1963 La Scala production of Puccini’s
“Boheme” is doubly welcome. There
have been innumerable attempts to
film grand opera ranging from abomin-
able to first-class. I would say that this
is the most successful attempt yet, for
this “Boheme” is good cinema as well
as good opera. Its star takes no part
in the performance. Franco Zeffirelli
was an experienced stage and film pro-
ducer when he turned to opera in 1948.
Since then he has become the only
man whose name actually eclipses the
star singers when he works for the
Metropolitan, for Covent Garden or La
Scala.
Although the film is the actual La
Scala production, filmed in the theatre
itself, there is no sign whatever of any
stage limitations, conventions, or
scenery which is painted. The camera
might well be in a studio, for the sets
(designed by Zeffirelli himself) are
multi-dimensional and he shoots his
characters from any angle so that the
viewer is never conscious of the
theatrical front view. It is interesting
to note that the world’s outstanding
opera producer is a realist.
Visually the film is an absolute
beauty, and the casting is a joy, though
it fails to bow to Hollywood conven-
tions of physical beauty. This is in
itself an asset, for a plain Mimi and a
pudgy Rodolfo', both acting well and
sincerely, are more convincing than the
handsome beauties of other films who
would never have remained starving in
their attics. Mirella Freni became an
overnight star after appearing in this
production, and it is easy to see why.
Her vocal performance is well known
from records. Her acting performance
is touching and would be even more so
away from unflattering close-ups.
Her Rodolfo is Gianni Raimondi, one
of the leading tenors in the world today,
who has a well-placed, full-bodied voice
of considerable beauty. Rolando Panerai
(Marcello) has recorded extensively,
but his brilliant acting ability is new
to us. His is the best acting performance
of the film; he is the key to the success
of the bohemian scenes. All four of the
men act their heads off, and since they
are vocally all in the top rank, we are
unlikely to ever experience the likes of
these scenes in this country. The
Musetta is the only cast member who
did not appear in the original, but
Adrianna Martino is ideally type-cast

a tomb of the Ashanti tribe. From an

Left to right, bronze warrior from the
West Cameroons, Akuaba, a fecundity

the others.
Zeffirelli is the star of the production.
Herbert von Karajan conducts, and, as
far as I could tell, conducts brilliantly.
Some of the tempi are a little slow, but
there could be rhyme behind his
reason.
Art
Out of Africa
By ELWYN LYNN
Primitive African Negro Art. Blaxland
Gallery, Sydney.
T
11 IS A rll Y that the Louis
Brouckxou collection of primitive Negro
art is not more formidable, the power
°f. sOIT ! e , the masks and statues is
vitiated by trifling artifacts. Indeed,
to recall what is in Pans Musee de
1^ on ?™ e and i° dlck throu § h the pages
of the Sculpture of Africa,
“Nigerian Images,” and “Tribes and
Forms in African Art” - with all of
which William Fagg of the British
Museum is associated s i ,n n 1 v
i • , ,i j r i
emphasises how scarce the good work
is here. Though the exhibition shows
rarely seen artifacts, it is the statues,
to which the above books are entirely
devoted, that emanate a potent
authority and are the repository of
disturbing symbolism; there are too few
here.
The exhibition is accompanied by
maps, photographs, and a catalogue
which attempts to give some idea of
the wide range of Negro art, but it is
an almost impossible task. In 1964-
William Fagg organised an exhibition
called Africa: 100 Tribes, 100 Master-
pieces for the Congress of Cultural
Freedom at the Berlin Festival; his
book, “Tribes and Forms in African
Art,” shows masterpieces of 122 tribes
and stresses the fact that there is no
such thing as a unitary African tribal
art, but a multiplicity of tribal arts
so different that “the sculpture of one
tribe will be meaningless and unintellig-
ible to people of another tribe, because
it is art divorced from its context of
belief.”
The recognition of this variety is not
just an anthropological or aesthetic
issue; the huge Festival of Negro Art
in Dakar in 1966 and the exhibition
at Paris’ Grand Palais in the same year
were occasions for the discussion of
Negritude, which is a vague nostalgia
for an Africa that once, it is supposed,
flourished under a common ideology.
It is a curious way of emphasising the
power of Negro culture, denying at
the same time the rich differentiation
of indigenous tribal cultures.
One obtains too little of this rich
differentiation from the present exhi-
bition, but there are good and typical
examples from some tribes: a Bamum
Dancing Mask has the habitual inflated
cheeks that strive to annihilate the
mouth; two Yoruba masks, poly-
chromed off-white and marked with
blue are fine examples, one of them
having as a hat a man being devoured
by a snake as he repairs a hut; a
Yoruba Commander Baton, which has
a kneeling woman with a breast in
each hand, is surmounted by a bird-
shaped axe, because, we are told,
“women are always represented with


( Left) Ivory Yoruba

son
Palaver group showing a chief
with two of his court consult-
ing Mygale, the sacred spider
Polychrome mask from Y oruba , showing
a snake devouring a man working on top
of a hut
the double blade of the Thunder Axe.”
No wonder Ibibio men hide behind
roughly carved masks with two faces;
the placid, delicate Baule heads evade
any commitment and in so doing
often decline into an Eastern banality.
Much of the brassware pipes,
bowls, and goblets indeed has an
Eastern look, rather cluttered, over-
decorated, and with no trace of those
large, simple, impacted planes that so
excited Braque and Picasso as they
forsook curves for cubism. Solidity
and simplicity reappear in fine Bami-
leke (a tribe neglected by the above
books) seats and a table, all skilfully
and intricately carved, the table, 24in.
high, being supported by three men
and three leopards, joined by their
middles. It costs SISOO, but a beauti-
fully carved wooden money box with
a frieze of elephants, monkeys, and
fish costs S3OO, and a worn musical
instrument called a hand piano, to be
had to the tune of $l5O, has a happy
resonance with rows of cane of differ-
ent widths for plucking and pressing.
Something that haunts me is the
mud sculpture of the Ibo and Ogan,
which can never be removed as it is
too fragile; it cracks, erodes, and is
washed away. It is supremely uncom-
mercial and artists have to be trained
in the tradition to repeat it. It can-
not be debased (as Australian bark
paintings are) for a commercial
market, nor can it be elevated as a
memorial to a glorious, unrepeatable
past as some Negritude - obsessed
Negroes are inclined to do with more
permanent art. Still, there is enough
here to make this an exciting show;
the very names associated with Negro
art are a mysterious incantation: Dan,
Tiv, Fang, Ibo, Ijo, Yoruba, Basonge.
Theatre
Weak Martini
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Night of the Iguana. Tennessee Wil-
liams. St. Martin’s, Melbourne.
TO SEE Tennessee Williams’ spiritual
mutants treading St. Martin’s boards
is a surprise; of the order of discover-
ing one’s bedridden Granny doing the
frug. And it is understandable that
producer Irene Mitchell would wish
to break her audience in gently. As
one of the few Williams’ plays free of
castration, immolation, frontal lobo-
tomy, and cannibalism, “Iguana” must
have seemed a good choice.
The Reverend Shannon hasn’t
exactly been winning friends and in-
fluencing people in his Episcopalian
career. Because of his healthy sexual
appetite and contempt for bourgeois
morality, the doors of his church have
been locked against him, and he is
threatened with charges of heresy and
statutory rape. So he’s taken employ-
ment as a guide for a busload of female
students touring Mexico.
As the play opens he has yielded to
a nymphet’s temptings, much to the
outrage of the trip’s lesbian cheer-
leader. Dimly aware that any last
chance of recouping his pulpit has
eroded, he abandons his busload and
takes feverish refuge with Maxine, a
nymphomaniac widow, whose hilltop
hotel overlooks both the ocean and
hygiene.
Enter Nonno, a name and character
borrowed from Becket. The world’s
oldest practising poet, he’s attended
by his granddaughter, a nomadic
lightning-sketch artist, and middle-aged
virgin Hannah Jelkes. Proud beggars,
they stay despite Maxine’s hostility,
paying their way with a continuous
stream of fey philosophising; like Most
Unforgettable Characters from a loony
Digest.
While St. Martin’s audience shifted
uneasily, the tipsy Maxine yearned for
Shannon, Nonno struggled with his
final poem, and the allegorical iguana
strained pitiably on its leash. And after
three wordy acts, Shannon and Hannah
discover to Maxine’s disgust that they
share a sexless love. Feeling confused
and perhaps even betrayed, the St.
Martini’s wandered out of their theatre,
little realising how lightly they’d been
let off.
Irene Mitchell’s production was full
of oversights or was it intentional
understatement? The script requires a
background sound of iguana rustlings,
although I’m sure that Williams would
have settled for a goanna’s. As it was,
nothing rustled. At one point Shannon
must be exhilarated by the majesty of
lightning, which he sees as an expres-
sion of the virile sort of God he wants
to serve. But his outburst was incon-
gruous in the light of puny torch-
flashings from the wings.
The set by Paul Kathner also had
its problems. He made good use of real
vegetation, but a background of im-
penetrable gloom reduced the contrast
between night and day, and failed to
give the necessary effect of height and
heat.
The cast: George Fairfax was fine
as Shannon, and Margaret Reid played
Hannah with her usual deliberate calm.
Despite a wavering accent, Carmel
Millhouse was satisfactorily sultry as


Maxine, and Keith McCartney was a
noble and pathetic Nonno.
A “New Stateman” contributor des-
cribed Williams’ writing about sex as
being like a teetotaller writing about
alcohol. Similarly, St. Martin’s tackled
this play as if they wished they hadn’t.
Out of the past
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
Hostile Witness. Jack Roffey. Tivoli,
Sydney.
WE ARE USED to old films on the
television, but not on the stage. Not
/iat “Hostile Witness” is in fact a
film, and neither is it old, because it
was written in the past few years, but
it resembles nothing so much as the
twenty- and thirty-year-old films we
see on the television. I suppose it
seems like a film, also, because Ray
Milland plays the lead and plays it
like a film actor, who is accustomed to
have the camera follow him closely and
faithfully record the raising of a famous
eyebrow, a half-smile, a half-shrug, and
quietly spoken sentences. His perfor-
mance makes the other actors seem
stagy, while their performances make
his seem understated.
Of course, any murder trial, real or
fictional, is a ready-made drama of
suspense, and this one has all the
familiar picturesque trappings of fiction:
a learned judge, who is old and
quirky, but wise underneath, a diabolical
Crown Prosecutor, senile Clerk of the
Court, and so on. It also has the
advantage of a brilliant QC in the
dock (Ray Milland) accused of mur-
dering an eminent judge, a baronet as
defence counsel (James Condon, suit-
ably histrionic), an attractive young
woman barrister as junior counsel
(Anne Haddy, whose feline elegance
gives her no resemblance to a woman
barrister), and a comically eccentric
Major to provide the alibi (John War-
wick, in a delightful comic perfor-
mance). But, as its elaborate but
predictable plot unfolds in, to our TV-
sophisticated eyes, an unconscionably
leisurely way, we have an overwhelm-
ing feeling of deja-vu.
Peter Brook the British director
has suggested that television has un-
wittingly succeeded in making the
viewer into something like the Brech-
tian observer, who can stand outside
the illusion, notice the illusionist’s tricks
of trade, and coolly evaluate their
effectiveness. “On television” he writes
“the cliches are naked: the viewer is
independent, he is walking about his
room, he hasn’t paid (which makes
it easier to switch off), he can voice
his disapproval out loud without be-
Peter Hurford
ing sssshed.” Peter Brook believes that
this new sophistication of the viewer
is one of the reasons why “the time-
honored forms in the theatre have
shrivelled and died in front of us.”
Certainly, attending “Hostile Wit-
ness” was like attending a ghost play.
Sooner or later, surely, even the com-
mercial theatre must realise that winds
of change are blowing down the aisles.
Merry-go-round
By ROBERT WARD
The Owl and the Pussycat. Wilton
Manhoff, Theatre 62, Adelaide.
THE OWE is a voyeur and book-sales-
man with intellectual leanings; the
Pussycat is a young, all-American call-
girl who says things like “I may be a
prostitute, but I’m not promiscuous.”
At the play’s opening, he had observed
her with a client and then performed
his “duty as a citizen” by ringing and
informing her landlord. The landlord
has evicted and robbed her, and so she
arrives at the book-salesman’s apart-
ment to demand, since it is his fault, a
bed for the night.
So the play begins; it ends, of course,
with the couple in love. In between is
one of the funniest situation-comedies
I have seen for years, with fast, witty,
and often brilliantly acid, dialogue.
Besides entertaining his audience, Man-
hoff’s concern is with his characters’
role-playing, and he shows them arriv-
ing at a modicum of self-knowledge and
experiencing all that the process
involves.
It is presented by The Hole-in-the-
Wall Theatre, one of Perth’s two pro-
fessional theatre companies, and one
which specialises in in-the-round pro-
ductions. Adelaide’s Theatre 62' is an
arena theatre, and so it allowed one
to see the players play on, as it were,
their home ground. Thus, one main
fault became apparent: at least a third
of the audience, those in the south-
western corner, missed seeing some
important business and much facial
play. Often a divan got in the way,
but more generally, the action seemed
to favor the other two thirds. I think
the trouble really lay with the play,
which seems to cry out for a pros-
cenium, but it’s worth making the
standard point that arena staging
requires actors to move too' often, too
quickly, and into too many places, with
no rest for them or the audience, and
often without regard to the natural
tempo of the play.
Perhaps that’s carping. “The Owl and
the Pussycat” is really excellently acted
by Chris Johnson and Kirsty Child, and
it is directed with professional poise by
Frank Baden-Powell.
Music
Heavy fare
By DAVID SALTER
Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Con-
ductor, Dean Dixon, soloist, Peter
Hurford. Town Hall, Sydney.
A DEPRESSINGLY dull first half, the
orchestra too obviously out of form,
the lengthy Mahler Fifth Symphony
as the main course (all on a humid
late-summer evening) this was a
combination formidable enough to test
the enthusiasm and physique of even
the seasoned concertgoer.
Peter Hurford tootled his way
through organ concertos by Handel
and Brixi without once making us feel
that he was anything more than a
bonus continuo. No flawless technician,
his typical organist’s tendency in rush-
ing the tempo only added to the
cautious and muddy sound produced.
Dixon helped here with some remark-
ably blase and unsympathetic accom-
panying.
That the strings of the SSO have
been progressively losing their bite and
brilliance over the past few months is
now more than clear. Mahler’s orches-
tral music demands virtuosity from
every player and even with the con-
stant support of a much-improved
brass section, last week’s account of the
Fifth was predictably untidy and limp.
The trombones and horns were excit-
ing in their tremendous loping triplet
passages, but the violins particularly
failed to complement this with that
edgy intensity called for so frequently
in the score.
As seems to be his habit in the
heavy, late-nineteenth-century sym-
phonies, Dixon tended to lump all
movements within a noticeably con-
fined range of speeds. A sense of
statistical mean is achieved rather than
a consciousness of structure and the
symphony gradually worked itself
down to a kind of jog-trot.

Urgent moves in Communist bloc trade
AUSTRALIA’S TRADE relations with the Communist
bloc have reached a very serious point and serious
measures are being taken to do something about it. In
an unprecedented move, the Government has invited the
Trade Ministers of Poland and Bulgaria to visit Australia
later this year, and they have accepted. These two men,
Mr. W. Trampcynski and Mr. Ivan Budinov, will make
history as the first two Communist bloc Ministers ever to
visit Australia. And a visit from senior Russian trade
officials may follow next year.
There can be little doubt about the extent of the crisis
or of the need (in view of Britain’s talks with Europe) for
a real sense of urgency in stopping the rot in Australia’s
trade with these countries. In the past three years, Aus-
tralia’s exports to Eastern Europe have been cut in half,
from $152 million to only $77 million in 1965-66, with
the latest six-monthly figures showing another severe fall.
And that is on top of the heavy drop in our sales to main-
land China from $l6B million to $lO6 million in 1965-66
(and only $33 million in the latest half-year). The main
factors in the collapse of cur Eastern European trade have
been in shipments of wheat and wool, as the U.S.S.R., for
example, bought less than $5O million worth last year
against $lll million three years before.
There is no doubt their own supply position has been
a factor in this, and so have our drought and wool prices.
So, perhaps, has Vietnam. But whatever the reason, the
Department of Trade has mounted a solid “be nice to the
Communists” campaign aimed at building our trade up
again. It no longer calls them “Communist bloc” (for
some reason they do not like the term, preferring “Social-
ist”), having switched terminology about 18 months ago
as one of the first shots in the battle to improve trade
relations with Russia and Eastern Europe, and take advan-
tage of their tentative moves toward economic liberalisation.
Australian trade delegations visited the U.S.S.R., Poland,
Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria in September and October,
1965, to survey possibilities. They were led by no less a
person than the Department’s Secretary, Sir Alan Wester-
man. Then in June Mr. McEwen tripped off to Europe,
going through them and signing formal trade agreements.
Visits here by men at the top in Eastern bloc trade are
regarded as quite crucial for, despite the moves toward

MEN AND MATTERS
THINGS WILL BE different at
Consolidated Milk Industries (the
N.S.W. Peters company) after this
weekend but only a little. True, it
may look like an upheaval for the
company that the strong-willed (and
strong-worded) 75-year-old managing
director, A. E. McCartney, is to step
down after 23 years of autocratic rule.
But he is staying on as chairman (no
doubt he will have plenty to say from
that position) and his successor as
managing director will be his son, 50-
year-old E. G. (Ted) McCartney.
Another son, Gordon, who runs the
Grafton factory, is also a director, so
the McCartneys will continue to
dominate the company’s five-man
board.
And yet another son, Alan, runs
Peters’ South Australian operations, as
three of A.E.’s six sons and one
daughter have followed him into the
company to ensure the family succes-
sion.
But if it looks like a family com-
pany, it is not one. The McCartneys
only hold a very small proportion of
its 11.7 million shares; A.E.’s rise to
absolute power during his 39 years
with the company has been on the
basis of his energy and ability alone;
11 years’ experience in milk was all
he brought into it when he came to
help solve the milk supply problems
that were then worrying Mr. F. A. B.
Peters, founder of
what was then the
Peters American
Delicacy Com-
pany.
Three years
later he was a
director, setting
out on a course
that changed the
nature of the
company from an
ice-cream maker,
whose interest in
milk (then subject
to shortages) was that it needed large
amounts for its ice-cream, to a company
that controlled a huge milk processing
and distributing operation, only a
small proportion of which went into
its ice-cream trade. To ensure his
supplies in 1938, A. E. pushed Peters
into building a milk factory at Taree
(then outside the Milk Board’s area,
and so it could use whatever proportion
of its production in ice-cream that it
wanted). Then the Milk Board ex-
tended its area to take in Taree and
so McCartney bought out Foleys to
gets its milk factory licence and put up
a big plant at Grafton, with capacity
now up to 80,000 gallons a day.
And since it had a big production
business, he needed a big distribution
one as well, so Peters bought out the
old-established (and rather sleepy)
Fresh Food and Ice Company. By

deciding to concentrate on milk and
milk products and not going into
other frozen foods, McCartney has
avoided a lot of the problems that
have come to Peters’ companies in
other States (Petersville in Victoria is
more a food than a milk products
company). But he, nevertheless, has
his problems as first drought and now
the ice-cream war have knocked his
company’s profits.
Consolidated Milk still has a small
shareholding in the other Peters’ com-
panies around Australia (Petersville,
Peters W.A., and Queensland United
Foods) and McCartney is a director
of the W.A. (where he was born) and
Queensland companies, but not of the
Victorian one, where the doughty 72-
year-old Mr. Emil Christensen runs
his company very much as if the
original N.S.W. Peters did not exist.


rationalisation and greater autonomy for enterprise manage-
ment, the nod or grunt of the top man in the Ministry
still has great power. It can swing millions of pounds worth
of trade from one country to another. At present our trade
with Eastern Europe is heavily in cur favor, with them
buying substantial quantities of wool and more recently
wheat, imd almost nothing else. From them we buy small
quantities of fish, furs, textiles, even exotic items such as
goats’ hair.
The Poles are most advanced in developing toward a
market, profit-oriented economy, and for the moment they
offer the greatest possibilites for expanded trade. They are
expressing their interest through their application for full
membership of the GATT, and they are already active in
tendering for capital goods contracts in the Western world.
State of the nation
LAST WEEK brought encouraging indicators on the state
of the domestic economy. Motor vehicle sales were at an
excellent level, though the appearance of new models may
mean they should be discounted slightly. The labor market
figures were healthy, too, showing that at last the economy
is regaining momentum. The pessimists, of course, will see
this as heralding the need for restraining measures to stem
the development of inflationary pressures. They would be
wrong. There is still plenty of slack in the economy, with
labor and capacity in good supply. Business capital expendi-
ture still seems to be declining, and, as such, is a strong
damper on the economy generally.
The news on the foreign payments front is less unequivo-
cally favorable. Capital inflow has declined sharply, and
this is more than offsetting the very favorable trade balance
we have been running for some time. But it is no cause
for undue alarm. It reflects to a large extent the downturn
in office building and the British restrictive measures which
have been coming in their effects for a good 18 months.
The rundown will not last for long, as prospects in other
parts of our foreign accounts look good.
Tantrums in travel
THERE HAD BEEN a blow-up coming for some time
between travel agents and those banks that have big travel
departments. It has come at last. The National Bank of
Australasia has been asked to appear before the Australian
Federation of Travel Agents in Melbourne next month to
answer complaints about unethical conduct, and the tradj;
paper “Travel Trade” reports that N.S.W. travel agents
have requested AFTA to take action with overseas shippers
and airlines over advertising by the Bank of N.S.W. and
the ANZ Bank that they claim has “broken the rules.”
The National Bank fuss arose out of a letter sent last
month by a local branch manager to a customer saying:
“We are prepared to provide overdraft accommodation to
the extent asked by you at our last interview, providing the
bank is permitted to handle all travel arrangements.” Travel
agents have often claimed that banks use their power to
grant overdrafts as a means of gaining travel business, and
regard this as unfair competition. But the director of the
Australian Bankers’ Association Research Directorate, Mr.
R. B. Cameron, had replied last year that banks “exert
no pressure to change (from existing travel agents) even
if that traveller was granted a loan by the bank to assist
with his travel expenses.”
Whatever the rights and wrongs of the affair (and a
case could be made out either way), the initiative of the
banks in going out after this business fits well into the new
“give them hell” image of the banks that has developed
in recent times as they have moved back into the hire-
purchase, personal lending, and developmental project
fields. The banks may be lots of things at present but
they are not sleepy.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: In an active statistical week,
most eyes sought the March employment figures; they
revealed a rather better situation. Job registrants
totalled 64,900 (February 76,300), while vacancies stood
at 42,800 (42,600) the clearest improvement for
some months.
March’s approvals for private home building reached
only 7928, a drop of 1393 on March, 1966; Govern-
ment approvals also went back by 80 to 1053. Both
sections are, however, ahead on the quarter . . . The
cost of living, as indicated by the consumer price index,
went up an average 0.4 percent in the six State capitals;
over the year to March the advance was 2.6 percent
. . . Steel production moved well ahead in March,
vehicle output rose moderately, and most consumer
durables kept their falling trend.
Some 34,066 new motor vehicles were sold in March,
965 more than March, 1966.
The trading hanks lent at an average $50.3m a week
during March, compared with February’s s3Bm, to
bring total advances to $2961.9m; overdraft limits stood
at $4330. lm, widening the gap between approvals and
actual withdrawals. Deposits added $26.7m to hit
$5515.9m.
Fresh American restrictions are expected to influence
Australia’s capital inflow; the Federal Treasurer
hazards a guess of a “lucky” ssoom private inflow
for 1966-67 against the previous year’s s9oom.
For the markets: Lively, well sustained and
widely spread dealings presented Australian share
markets with their best period so far for 1967 and
Friday saw the biggest overall index gain for more
than a twelvemonth. Takeover efforts enlivened trading
as well. Base metals march vigorously on.
Quite a few industrial issues found some recovery
in London, yet some leaders appeared unsettled toward
the end . . . Small individual advances on Wall Street
suggest an atmosphere of keen selection; volumes are
moderate.
For companies: It suddenly appeared most
obviously to be a week of takeover and attempted
takeover ... At least it ended on an accomplished
fact, with Tooheys having bought R. W. Miller’s brew-
ing interest land, buildings, and plant at Petersham
(N.S.W.); the cash consideration is undisclosed . . .
A battle is really joined by Ingham Enterprises Pty.’s
counter-offer for Victoria’s Golden Poultry Farming
Industries, already under assault from the combined
forces of British Tobacco and Allied Mills; the Ingham
brothers, J. H. and R. W., bid $1.50 a GP share
against $1.28 and will be content with “not less than
60 percent of each shareholding”; meanwhile, Allied
Mills announces a small profit advance, from $340,637
to $350,745, for its February half-year and a private
placement of 500,000 50-cent ordinaries at $1.50 . . .
Shareholders of Davies Coop are now under the direct
battery of Viyella International, which proposes to close
its 40 cent offer two months earlier, on May 12; Viyella
does not consider failure, but must await a further
reply by Davies Coop directors.
By now a seasoned pastoralist, Whale Industries, has
been asked to talks with an unnamed party to consider
a cash bid; “don’t sell” is directors’ message . . .
Troubled GM-H dealer Stack and Co. is about to get
an offer for a controlling interest from investment
group Industrial Equity . . . Australian Controls must
meet a rival in its effort to obtain ladder maker Harper
Davidson; Larke Consolidated comes along with $2 a
share against an already board-approved $1.70.
The solid ground of Nature (plus a few man-made
improvements) kept to the fore with miners and metals
... In three months to March, Hamersley Holdings

WILD CAT PAGES
Behind the balance sheets
Buy Ansett and chance it
impact of the DC9s
MINING • SHARE • LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
THE STOCKMARKET welcomed
last week’s arrival of the first of six
new Douglas DC9s on to inter-capital
flights by adding a few cents to the
depressed price of shares in Ansett
Transport Industries Ltd. This lifted
them back to 60 cents after they had
been down around the 55 cent mark
- —their lowest for five years. It was
a sensible welcome; the DC9s are go-
ing to bring a great change in Ansett’s
airline profitability, which has been very
poor indeed in recent years.
For one of the major misconceptions
about Ansett is that his non-airline
operations are a waste of time, effort,
and money, and that his group might
as well cut them out. But the facts
are that, despite a disastrous television
experience (it will be many years be-
fore that lot can pull its weight), the
group’s revenue from non-flying activities
totalled s3s| million last year and pro-
vided about 60 percent of the group’s
profit. They have been carrying the
company for some years, yet they make
up only one third of the company’s
assets and bring in one third of its gross
revenue. The chances are that they
could continue to do better, particularly
the tourist section of the company as
cheaper fares across the Pacific en-
courage more visitors from the U.S.
But from now on, it appears likely
that the airline part of Ansett is at
last to provide a return far more in
keeping with its usage of two-thirds
of the group’s assets (depending, of
course, on the company’s ability to
attract passengers, and there seems
scope for improvement on that score).
The economics of the swing to jets
has already had its impact on the pro-
fits of world airlines (even BOAC re-
ported a profit this year), as many that
were running at deficits are now well
and truly in the black. And the same
thing should happen in the Australian
internal system.
These DC9s are the key to the future
of Ansett. Provided the growth of air
traffic in Australia averages 1\ percent
a year for the next six years (it has
done much better than that in the past
six), that cost rises are offset by fare
rises (which is unlikely), that a 63 per-
cent load factor is maintained, that
the company pays at least 40 percent
tax and that there are no further
changes in the company’s aircraft
orders, then the big changes in the
company’s fleet involved in the swing
to jets will have a significant impact
on the point at which the company
begins to earn a profit on each flight
from the number of seats filled and
amount of freight carried.
When borrowing costs and deprecia-
tion are included, the break-even on
Viscount operations has averaged about
68 percent utilisation; on a Lockheed
about 58 percent, on a Boeing 727 it is
56 percent, and on a DC9 it is forecast
as only 50 percent under Australian
conditions. So provided Ansett’s
revenue load factor can be kept up at
63 percent, the phasing out of the older
aircraft will mean that the group’s
average break-even point will probably
go as low as 52 percent in 1972, leav-
ing a very large margin for profit—
provided the DC9 estimates are right.
The immense significance of this gap
can be seen from the fact that in 1964
Ansett’s average break-even was 63.7
percent and its revenue load factor was
barely above it by only 0.8 percent at
64.5 percent —yet the company still
earned $600,000 pre-tax from its airline
operations; in 1965 the break-even
factor had fallen to 62.2 percent and
the revenue load factor to 63.7 percent,
leaving a margin of only 1.5 percent
which earned Ansett a pre tax airline-
only profit of $1.4 million. And last
year the gap was 2.1 percent (63 to
60.9 percent) to earn $2.2 million pre-
tax. A margin of 10 percent by 1972
should have a staggering impact on
profit provided the Government
allows it.
One forecast is that Ansett’s airline
pre-tax profit could rise to $13.3 million
on these assumptions by 1972 when its
four Boeings and 10 DC9s will have
doubled its 1965 capacity. And if its
other activities maintained their recent
rate of rise in profitability, the group
could be earning as much as $l9 mil-
lion pre-tax, $11.4 million after tax,

The Chartist says:
MOUNT ISA MINES LIMITED is still basically in a long-term five percent
uptrend and at times is able to hold intermediate uptrend rates in excess of
40 percent appreciation per annum. A high of $4.88 was achieved in 1964 prior
to the commencement of the downtrend at the time of the strike, which took
prices close to the $3.00 level. A double bottom reversal pattern suggested a
target of approximately $4.80 and a 40 percent trend rate was followed up to
May, 1966, after which prices fell to $3.90. A recovery back to $4.85 in August
1966, under the influence of the LME copper price, achieved the 1965 base
projection. However, the situation is showing bearish tendencies at present and
prices have already fallen to $3.62. Some reaction could be expected to this fall,
but the overall top formation suggests a decline to possibly the $3.20 level. Last
sale price on 19/4/67 $3.78.

and about 23 cents a share on the exist-
ing capital structure, or more than three
times last year’s modest earnings of
7 cents. This will not take place, of
course, because higher costs will have
to be absorbed within this structure
rather than passed on, but at least this
demonstrates that the future should not
be as dismal for the company as many
investors fear. In addition, the 63 per-
cent forecast utilisation ,may be in
danger, as there has been an evident
downward trend in Ansett’s revenue
load factor in recent years from the
64.5 percent of 1964 to 62.9 percent in
1966. (TAA’s was 63.3 percent last
year, but Ansett runs more country
routes that do not have such high load
factors as on the inter-city routes.)
But the arrival of more new air-
craft should not force the utilisation
average down any further, although in
earlier years these big re-equipment
bursts would bring sharp falls in the
revenue load factor despite the stimulus
they would give to the number of
travellers. For the additional capacity
made available would rise even faster
than the demand. That is not the case
today, as additional capacity will
largely go toward increasing the air-
line’s ability to cope with demand,
which is already well ahead of capacity
at peak-hour flights. So the magnitude
of Ansett’s overall $67 million re-
equipment program is not bearish by
any means, even though financing it
is going to mean a continued and
heavy need for funds. And there is a
strong likelihood that Ansett’s scope
for raising money in Australia may be
seriously limited, particularly following
the unhappy experience of many institu-
tions who contributed to share place-
ments at 77 and 75 cents in recent years
and are now suffering paper losses.
And there seems to be a limit to
its borrowing potential. In any event,
its own gearing is very high at present
as the $36 million of shareholders’
funds is supporting a debt structure of
$B3 million. Already the interest bill
of $4.3 million last year (which will
rise appreciably this year) is far greater
than the $2.2 million paid out in
dividends. But the staggering of de-
livery times of the pure jets in the
Ansett fleet (four 727 s and 10 DC9s)
over eight years, combined with the
repayments that will come from re-
venue, means that the company will
have to go, at most, another slB| mil-
lion into debt in the U.S. (and that
will be by the end of this year).
But the increases that should come
in revenue terms from the introduction
of these new aircraft (which are far
more economical to fly) should more
than offset these costs of borrowing.
The first six DC9s, costing $27 million,
are being financed by a loan of $2O
million from the Export Import Bank
with payment being on the basis of a
10 percent deposit and the rest over
seven years.
Ansett now claims to have per-
cent of passenger and freight traffic
in Australia, but there are reports
that TAA has been getting about 54
percent of the passenger traffic on the
more remunerative mainline routes
and each one percent movement either
way reflects a swing of $350,000,
according to one expert. On the other
hand, Ansett carries about one-third
more freight than TAA.
The recent interim report was not a
really good one, showing that the rate
of rise in revenue had fallen sharply
to less than six percent compared with
16 percent for the previous full year.
Nevertheless, the company’s profit did
increase by $264,299 to $2.2 million
in the first half after a much higher
tax provision. But there have been
further cost rises; pilot salaries went up
sharply last September, and the full
impact of that would not have been
felt in the first half.
Ansett’s accounts are by no means an
analyst’s delight using normal criteria;
the gearing looks too high for com-
fort, the current ratio far too low
(especially as $5 million of the current
assets of s39| million are film rights),
the huge increase to come in borrowing
costs leaves a smaller margin for error
for the earning rate, and the company
appears to have some local borrowing
problems ahead of it. Within two years
of last July, the company faces the
maturity of sll| million in unsecured
notes, $6.7 million in loans on aircraft,
$1.3 million in mortgages, and $25.8
million in other creditors, so that more
than half of the company’s $B4 million
liabilities at last June are due by the
end of June next year. But there seems
no real danger that they will not be
re-financed, although the very magni-
tudes involved certainly raise prob-
lems. The current prospectus for a
$5 million debenture issue (under-
written to $2l million) has been open
since October and closes at the end
of this month.
The consolidated accounts exclude
Ansett’s Queensland television head-
ache, Universal Telecasters, in which
the Ansett group has $4 million at risk,
which has a deficit in shareholders’
funds of $291,000 and is still losing
money. Channel 0 in Melbourne is
expected to break even next financial
year, but the Queensland operation is
not expected to contribute to profits for
10 years or so.
This company’s share price is very
subject to public uneasiness as well
over half its shares are held by indi-
viduals whose holdings average less
then 1000 shares each. Institutional
investors have only about percent
of the company’s capital; other public
companies (notably Boral and W. R.
Carpenter) together hold a quarter of
the shares. Ansett shares have been
subjected to some selling pressure from
clients of some of its former underwrit-
ing brokers, who have been urging their
disposal since the financial structure of
the company changed so significantly.
Investors are clearly nervous of the
Ansett group, and with some cause. It
faces a lot of problems, and the chair-
man and managing director, Mr. R. M.
Ansett, always manages to put a bit of
gloom into his annual addresses by
complaining about something or other.

Government fiscal decisions which had
a most severe impact on the cost struc-
ture of the industry.” If the Libs are
making it tough for him (profit fell
last year), what will the other side do
now that it must be given some chance
of getting in under its new leader?
The political implications of Ansett
must always be a factor in its share
price, and before each election there
will inevitably be a nervous downturn
in share prices.
On the other hand, it would clearly
be politically dangerous for any Gov-
ernment to deliberately destroy Ansett’s
10 percent dividend rate, which is,
long-established after all, not an unrea-
sonable one. The corollary of this is
that it would be equally politically im-
possible for Ansett to earn big profits,
either, no matter what the economics
of the new DC9s should mean in extra
profits. In any event, if the airline
were nationalised the compensation
needed would at least cover its liabil-
ities, and profits from non-airline oper-
ations should soon be large enough to
cover the 10 percent dividend anyway
(this financial year, for example, they
should probably get as high as $3.7
million pre-tax). So there is a ceiling of
expectations about investing in Ansett—
unless he eventually decides to float off
his non-aircraft operations separately—
just as there should be a basement.
But the ceiling should eventually prove
to be well over the dollar mark and
the present price looks as if it should
be the basement.
Clan McDonald
IT GOT QUITE embarrassing for one
of the B. J. McDonalds of Sydney
when another of them began to hit the
financial pages especially as their
activities were roughly in the same
field. For when Bill Hodgkiss and
associates made their failed bid for
Southgate Investments, which has
hotel interests, one of his “associates”
listed in the handouts to the Press on
the matter was a Mr. B. J. McDonald.
To many, it looked as if the managing
director of Astor Hotel Motels Ltd.,
Sydney solicitor Mr. Barry J. McDon-
ald, was the man. But not so; Barry
sent a letter to the Press saying the
other fellow was called Bruce and had
nothing to do with him.
They are two quite different people.
Barry, 52-year old senior partner in
the old-established firm of solicitors
Shaw McDonald and Co. (two of his
numerous daughters are in partnership
with him), has had long associations
with the liquor trade because of his
specialist interest in the licensing law
(on which he has written the text
book in N.S.W.).
The other B. J. McDonald, a civil
engineer and town planner, is in his
early 30s, has only two children and
is a Queensland resident partner of
the organisation Bill Hodgkiss runs
following his departure from the old
Savoy Corporation (in which the
Whelan family had a large interest at
one time - and, coincidentally, Barry
McDonald had acted for the Whelans).
Last week Barry went off on a world
trip and once again the public re-
lations’ handouts went around. But
this time he was clearly labelled
“Bruce.”

Since Lysaght hold their
steel in coil form, cutting
to sheet size as and when
required, the user can
estimate his forward
requirement in terms of
tonnage only. In addition,
his steel can be delivered
not in standard sheet
sizes (which may entail
offcut losses) but as “pre-
cut blanks’’ —another
Lysaght service leading
to considerable savings.
The new deal in steel.
If you would like to know
more about the Lysaght
“new deal in steel,’’ write
to Lysaght or have a word
with your usual supplier.
Order blanks take up less
room than steel sheets.
With the introduction by
Lysaght of a 7-day
delivery cycle, manu-
facturers are finding it
possible to release a
great deal of space (not
to mention capital)
formerly tied up in steel
stores. Instead of housing
the many steel qualities,
gauges and sheet sizes
needed for months ahead,
the manufacturer simply
orders what he needs
for production in the
immediate future. This is
supplied, against a total
tonnage requirement,
from stocks held by
Lysaght at strategically
placed Steel Service
Centres. He can thus pro-
gressively release space
and capital, with a general
reduction in overhead.

Trendex Timing Techniques:
The main business of Trendex and Co
Pty Ltd is portfolio management. In choos-
ing stocks for purchase or sale, due regard
is paid to company performance, balance
sheet features, the growth or decline in
earnings per share, and the like. However,
we also recognise that the market move-
ment of a stock may be quite at variance
with the apparent company merit. Ac-
cordingly, we recommend sound company
stocks for purchase only if market action
indicates that the price is likely to move
upwards. Similarly, notwithstanding ap-
parent company merit, we recommend the
sale of stocks which are likely to suffer
substantial market deterioration.
The methods which we use in-forecasting
market behaviour were developed to suit
Australian conditions exclusively by Tren-
dex and Co Pty Ltd. To bring them to the
notice of investors we began to publish
Trendex in 1961. Subscribers are shown
how to apply the techniques for themselves,
and many are doing this with success.
Each week, the latest issue of Trendex
describes current examples.
Use of Charts:
Naturally enough, for some time the
Trendex methods were looked upon with
disdain by most brokers and investors.
Although similar methods had been used
overseas for many years, they were quite
new to Australia. In due course, however,
the dramatic success of many Trendex
forecasts led to acceptance by some brok-
ing houses, and by a good sprinkling of
institutional and other professional invest-
ment managers.
It is no longer bad form to admit to
keeping charts. Indeed, the pendulum is
swinging right over the other way. Some
people now expect charts to be a complete
and reliable forecasting system in them-
selves all anybody has to do is to look
at a chart and know for sure whether a
stock will move up or down in the market!
This is far from the truth. Charts are
simply a means of recording facts on
paper, no more and no less. A chart can be
no better than its user. Successful use of
charts is an art, compounded of various
ingredients, not the least of which is long
experience. But even if interpreted with
great skill, bar charts and point-and-figure
charts nevertheless are only a couple of the
many tools in the kit bag of the successful
market-action analyst.
Other Trendex Techniques:
Charts alone tell only part of the story.
Indeed, charts by themselves can be dis-
tinctly misleading at times, especially in
the hands of the inexperienced, who often
feel that they must derive a message from
every chart. Only a few charts can give a
useful buying or selling message, at any
one time.
Other techniques often can be highly
useful, sometimes giving clear-cut market-
action signals well before ordinary chart
interpretation possibly could do so. Most
of those which are known overseas and are
applicable to Australian conditions are
explained fully in the book “Forecasting
Australian Stock Prices with Trendex”,
which every subscriber receives. Others,
including some of the most useful, have
been developed by our own research to
suit Australian market conditions. Such
techniques sometimes enable the very top
or the very bottom of a market move to be
pinpointed for particular stocks in which
major falls or rises are imminent E. Z.
Industries, Dunlop, Mount Isa and Blue
Metal have been conspicuous examples.
Market Strength Listings:
In Trendex we keep under weekly super-
vision an Action Table of stocks which
have been recommended for purchase or
for sale. They are followed through until
market action indicates that they should
be closed out. We also publish in Trendex
from time to time tabulations of a much
wider range of stocks, covering many hun-
dreds. Each stock is placed in one or other
of the groups ranging from those which
are behaving strongly, to those which are
behaving very weakly, and are likely to
fall.
The Challenge to Your
Judgment:
The Trendex techniques provide a much
better guide to the future price action of
stocks than you could possibly derive in any
other way. Otherwise, would you not be
able to beat the Trendex record? Why not
test yourself out?
In the Trendex issue of sth May we
shall again be tabulating many hundreds
of stocks, according to likely future price
action. The tables of Probable Market Per-
formance will range from Highest (possi-
bly 40 50 stocks) to Lowest (several hun-
dred stocks). You are challenged to select
25 stocks the poorest 25 from the
“Highest” tabulation, and to choose the
best 25 stocks from the “Lowest” tabula-
tion. If you can pick 25 in the second group
which perform better over a period of six
months than the 25 in the first group, you
qualify for the award of $l,OOO. From
those who qualify, the award will be made
to the person whose 25 stocks from the
“Lowest” group in Trendex out-perform
his choice of 25 “Highest” stocks by the
greatest margin.
Who is Eligible?
The challenge to try to beat the Trendex
performance is open to anybody who is
registered as a Trendex subscriber on both
the closing date for entries (12th May)
and the assessment of results (3rd Novem-
ber). You may enlist the aid of your
brokers, bankers, accountants, investment
advisers, or anybody else you wish. You
don’t have to risk your money in the
market just mark your choices on the
rating list in our sth May issue, and send
them in.
Do You Have a Chance?
Yes, indeed, you certainly do have a
chance to meet this challenge and to earn
the $l,OOO. Trendex is not infallible; no-
body is. Trendex does not know the future
nobody does. On the other hand, it is
just as well for you to know what you are
up against. Trendex scores a very high
proportion of successes higher than
anybody else can claim. It does this by
using its skill and experience to interpret
market action. Market action expresses
the interplay of buying power and selling
pressure, and gives clues to what the likely
future price trend of a stock may be. Most
times, the method is strikingly successful.
How to Participate:

be published in Trendex on Friday, sth

Petrol war and all
Some reasons to back Sleigh
By PELIAS in Melbourne
LAST YEAR, H. C. Sleigh barely
covered its ten percent dividend with
its 11 percent earning rate. This year,
the market clearly fears that the sale
of 70 percent of its Hardie Rubber
subsidiary will mean a further cut in
earnings and another slice off the
dividend. But there seems every pros-
pect that, despite the continued inten-
sity of the petrol war, H. C. Sleigh
may emerge with its payout unscathed.
And the risk involved in backing that
possibility on the stockmarket is very
small in relation to the potential re-
wards.
There is little doubt that in the
long term the scrip is worth much more
than its present 57 cents. Apart from
its earnings potential, the asset back-
ing is exactly twice the current market
price, which is the lowest for many
a year and is 20 cents below the 1966
“high,” despite the brighter future
now expected for the group. The pres-
ent price, yielding percent after
brokerage, indicates the market has
already discounted the possibility of a
dividend fall; holding it would mean
a price rise for the stock.
But there is a prospect that earning
rate could be improved on in the cur-
rent year. With even better prospects
in 1967-68 and no liquidity problems
( pace the picture provided by the
group’s balance sheet), directors are
unlikely to make any reduction in the
payout. Profit rose in the December
half-year, despite the exclusion of
returns from what is now a 30 percent
investment in Hardie Rubber and any
dividends from Australian Lubricating
Oil Refinery, which is apparently
going to maintain its payout this year.
In the previous half, returns from the
100 percent equity in Hardie were
included in the profit.
The inclusion of income from these
sources in the year-end accounts, on
top of possible benefits to the group
from the Phillips Oil acquisition, will
provide an added boost to the final
result. Phillips Oil itself is unlikely
to make any money for the group this
year, but petroleum supplies to the
new chain at the rate of a million
gallons a month should return extra
profits for the group’s petroleum divi-
sion as a whole. This is one of the
many benefits which will be flowing
Sleigh’s way as a result of its deal
with the American Firestone group
over Hardie Rubber.
This was an important deal for
Sleigh’s operations as a whole. Hardie
had been a growing source of worry
to the board because of the intense
competition in the tyre industry. On
top of this, it had been a heavy drain
on funds, most of which were
advanced to the subsidiary in the form
of loans. The position is now reversed
and, with Firestone behind it, Hardie
seems sure to look up. Although Sleigh
will now have only a 30 percent
interest in any improvement, it has
collected $4.8 million for the 70 per-
cent sale and will get $11.7 million in
loan money paid back over the next
three years.
The release of all this cash has not
only reduced Sleigh’s borrowing costs,
it has given it room to move, to com-
pete more effectively and to expand.
The Phillips acquisition simply could
not have taken place without the
Hardie sale. There are, of course,
many other factors which augur well
for the group in the future. Petrol
prices have been increased and, des-
pite all the hoo-haa about cheap
Japanese petrol, all petroleum groups
should see a rise in profits. The com-
pany’s shipping activities are most suc-
cessful, and the increasing trade and
tourist flow between Australia and
Japan leaves the group well placed.
THE 35-CENT fall in Brownbuilt
shares since J. Lysaght made a bid for
Brown and Dureau (its share list neigh-
bor), instead of a widely rumored offer
for Brownbuilt, has brought them down
to a very interesting level. There was
sound logic behind suggestions that
Lysaghts might take over Brownbuilt, as
the big sheet steel company is keen to
expand and Brownbuilt is in the
process of installing a pre-painted strip
line to compete with the large plant
recently installed by Lysaghts. (Unfor-
tunately, Brownbuilt’s is several months
behind schedule due to delivery delays
from its British supplier and this could
hold back its profit growth a little.)
Brownbuilt’s 50-cent shares appear to
have bottomed round the present $l.BO
level. They went as low as $1.70 in
the 1966 calendar year as a reaction to
the reduced 1965-66 profit, but the
market did not leave the shares so low
for long.
A major attraction of the shares is
the regular pattern of cash and bonus
issues which the company has estab-
lished over the past few years. As the
last issue was on a cash basis in 1965,
the next should be a bonus if the pattern
continues, and should come later this
year or early in 1968. In addition,
there should be an upward adjustment
in the market price over the next few
months through natural causes alone,

as the company appears to be enjoying
a good 1966-67 year.
A five percent profit gain was
reported for the latest December half,
and there will probably be a stronger
gain in the current six months but
there will need to be to maintain the
34 percent earning rate on capital in-
creased by a small takeover and the full
ranking of shares from the 1965 issue.
However, with the added boost pro-
vided by initial returns from the take-
over of a W.A. group, it seems unlikely
that earning rate would dip below 30
percent. This will provide double cover
for the 15 percent dividend which is
sure to be maintained. This cover, as
well as the extremely strong financial
position which the group is in, will leave
adequate scope for an issue some time
in 1967-68. Takeover, of course, remains
an ever-present prospect.
VICTORIA INSURANCE is in a
recovery trend which could eventually
take the shares from their present $2.28
to around $3, and could provide some
appreciation within a few months. In
the meantime, the dividend yield is
fairly good at 5.5 percent. The $1
units were fetching $2.75 earlier this
year, when share markets were gener-
ally strong. The market weakening
later took them to $2.45, and the set-
back to $2.20 recently was apparently
the result of some sellers getting the
shakes over the group’s purchase of
Southern Cross Assurance. The
recovery to the current level only took
a week and should keep on going; it
is the lowest the shares have been for
years. They were as high as $5.25 in
1963 and the last time they saw $3
was in February, 1966. This mark
should not be hard to reach again.
Higher profits should be earned this
year. Profits rose in the December
half and so did premium income, an
all-important pointer to the future.
Directors have stated that the Tas-
manian fires will not have a material
effect on the annual result. Hence, an
improvement on last year’s 13.6 percent
earning rate can be expected. This
alone should give the market a boost,
as the 1965-66 rate did not provide
what could be called a comfortable
cover for the 12| percent dividend.
But the real boost in profits should
come from the Southern Cross acqui-
sition, even though it did not take
place until March. Some shareholders
saw this as a bear point, presumably
because it was reported that the buy
cost Victoria Insurance $2 fnillion-odd
when, only five years ago, American
interests purchased it for $1.2 million.
The fact is that, since then, Southern
Cross Assurance has undergone radical
changes. Under American ownership
the company expanded quite signifi-
cantly, introduced new selling methods
and a new range of policies.

Oil’s on the way
But what’s in it for Ampol
By JASON in Sydney
THIS WEEK, the first tanker-load of
crude oil from Australia’s biggest oil-
field, the Wapet one on Barrow Island,
arrives at BP’s Kwinana Refinery. It’s
good news for the balance of pay-
ments, as Barrow Island will produce
about $330 million worth of high-
quality crude oil (as the ad. says, “it’s
better and there is more of it” than
at Moonie) over the next 15 years or
so that Australia would otherwise have
had to import.
And it is good news for shareholders
in Ampol, too, although they have no
idea how good. So far their directors
have not let them into the secret of
what price they will get or of how
Ampol Exploration (the 67 percent-
owned subsidiary) intends to use the
cash it will get from its one-seventh
stake in production. The lack of in-
formation from Ampol is in contrast
with the very full statement made by
the chairman, Mr. L. J. Thompson,
when estimates of the Barrow reserves
were about 85 million barrels instead
of the present 114 million. At that
time he had estimated Ampol Explora-
tion’s stake as worth $25 million, which
would come in at a rate building up
tq $2 .million a year by 1969.
At first glance, there may not be
very much in it for Ampol share-
holders in positive, take-home pay
terms apart from the removal of a
steady drain of funds, as its likely re-
turns from Barrow will not do very
much more than recoup its contri-
butions to Wapet over the last 15 years
and meet its requirements for the next
15 (provided the recent rate of ex-
ploration is maintained). The Ampol
situation appears to be this: Wapet,
which is simply a contract explorer,
has found 114 million barrels of oil
and it is now producing this at the
rate of 9000 barrels a day, but will
increase that to about 22,000 barrels
over the next 12 months. That will
mean an annual production rate of
about 8 million barrels. And if the
price ex-field is about $2.90 a barrel
(or $3.25 or so at Kwinana), as seems
likely, then Ampol Exploration is
entitled to one-seventh of the field’s
income of $23 million a year or
about $3.3 million.
So this oilfield, which will cost
million to bring into production,
will return the partners something like
a gross $330 million, leaving about
$3OO million to be split up of
which Ampol Exploration is entitled
to $43 million plus up to $7 million in
royalties. So, over the next 15 years
or so, Ampol Exploration, which by
the end of this year will have met about
$l4 million of the $lOO million spent
by Wapet in the search for oil over
the last 15 years, stands to make a gross
$5O million and a net $36 million be-
fore tax and before meeting the cost of
its borrowings. Ampol Exploration has
about $6 million of unrecouped capital
expenditure available as a tax deduc-
tion.
Wapet will be no doubt continuing
the WA search with great intensity after
this find, and it seems that an annual
exploration outlay of about $lO mil-
lion a year would not be impossible
(that is the rate this year), so requiring
Ampol Exploration to put back into
the search about million a year
out of the $3.3 million gross revenue
it seems likely to get from Barrow.
That leaves only a fairly modest return,
out of which many costs and redemp-
tions have to be met. But, if Wapet
are keeping up this search, the pros-
pects are that they will come up with
at least one additional oilfield. There
are 16 exploration wells set down for
this year (four, of which one has been
completed, in the Perth basin; nine
in the Carnarvon basin, of which two
are on the mainland and seven on
islands spreading from the Monte Bellos
to N.W. Cape, and three in the Can-
ning Basin, which extends from
Broome to Port Hedland).
But the areas where the company
expects oil are slowly diminishing.
Wapet has in fact given up (or farmed
out) 43 percent of its original tene-
ments in W.A. Nevertheless, it has
so,me other successes among its long
long list of disappointments. It has an
excellent gas prospects at Dongara if
only it could find someone who wants
to use 70 million cubic feet a day in
the Geraldton area to make it worth-
while (the whole of Perth’s domestic
consumption of gas is only 2 million
cubic feet a day).
Barrow oil will supply about four
percent of Australia’s daily consump-
tion, and will go at least some of the
way (with Moonie’s two percent) to
reduce the $3lB million a year oil im-
port bill. The structure of the Barrow
oil field is difficult, and 240 wells are
required (one every 80 acres) to pro-
duce the 22,000 barrels a- day, com-
pared with Moonie’s 30-odd to produce
half that amount. And the Barrow
field requires a difficult “sand-crack-
ing” process in most of the wells to
make them run easily, involving forcing
open the oil sands that lack the per-
meability needed. This involves push-
ing large quantities of coarse sand
down into the well under pressure and
breaking open the structure. But this
disadvantage is offset by the fact that
the oil is only 2300 feet below ground
(although there is some coming in from
a deeper structure as well, but not
enough to make it commercial on its
own).
IF SHAREHOLDERS in Australia’s
biggest oilfield are not at all sure
what is in it for them, the same goes
for shareholders in companies now
developing the country’s biggest iron-
ore deposit at Mt. Newman. The re-
fusal of the BHP to state the price at
which it is buying its 70 million tons
of ore (out of the 170 million tons
already contracted for sale) or for the
group to state an average profit figure
per ton are only two of the reasons
for shareholders in CSR not having
much of a clue about the merit of
their company as an iron-ore invest-
ment. A bother is that CSR has been
very coy indeed about its own financing
arrangements. For CSR still has to
meet an $11.4 million bill for Mt.
Newman, and its own resources do not
look up to that sort of expenditure.
It could be that some of these ques-
tions will be settled when the company
makes its report in a few months’ time
for the year that ended on March 31.
CSR’s annual reports have been im-
proving in content (there is still a lot
more information needed, though,
such as some real guide to the
profitability of the various sections of
this highly diversified monster) and
there seems a real prospect that some
guidance on iron ore could emerge. In
any event, a Melbourne investment
analyst has estimated that CSR share-
holders could expect their company to
earn between $1.35 million and $2.04
million a year out of Newman, to add
an extra 2.3 percent to 3.4 percent
return on to the earning rate now
ruling on CSR’s present equity capital
and that is before taking into
account any redemption of debentures
that may be necessary. As CSR’s earn-
ing rate is about 23 percent, this would
clearly not have any major impact on
earnings if it turned out to be near
the mark.
One irony of the Mt. Newman deal
is that some of the cash CSR needs
for it will be coming, in effect, from
rival iron-ore producer, Hamersley
Iron (whose Canberra lobbyist is
waging a heavy newsletter campaign
against Mt. Newman). For Mr. Lang
Hancock has bought the Wittenoom
asbestos mine from CSR for about $1
million, and he is paying for it out
of the several millions of dollars he is
getting from Hamersley in royalties.

Security analysis
When will Woolworths pause
in its expansion?
WOOLWORTHS LIMITED has
recently issued its annual report for the
year ended January 31, 1967. The
figures which were quoted in the first
article (8., March 25) can now be
amended, but it must be remembered
that the only effect is to substitute
figures which are six months ahead of
the others for figures which were six
months behind. That is to say, the
figures are still not entirely comparable.
It can, however, be noted that, despite
the quite substantial increase in profit
(and sales), the earnings - per - share
figure showed a fairly marked decline
as a result of the substantial increase
in the ordinary capital of Woolworths
just before the end of the past (1965/6)
financial year. The fall is about 4J
percent from 8.2 cents to 7.8 cents. This
year to date the shares have been sell-
ing at around 16 times earnings,
whereas in 1958 they were selling at
29 times earnings (even before the
craze for “buying earnings” began).
It would seem that those who were
buying the shares to show an earnings
yield of 3.4 percent (!) in 1958 were
expecting earnings per share to grow
at an average rate of 14 percent per
annum compound for at least the next
ten years. In fact, earnings per share
have grown at about 5J percent over
the nine years and next year’s growth
is unlikely to make up the lost ground.
The judgment was then very seriously
out and has cost those who made it
quite a little if they have stayed with
the stock for the past nine years.
Today, with the shares selling at
$1.23 to give an earnings yield of 6.4
percent, it looks as though a rate of
growth of only 4 percent is expected;
this growth rate seems to be much more
likely of attainment. Furthermore, the
old-fashioned dividend yield is a fairly
comfortable 4.9 percent instead of the
microscopic 2 percent of 1958, when
the dividend was only covered about
1.7 times by earnings.
Before considering (as best we can)
Woolworths’ prospects of making the
4 percent growth rate over the next ten
years, it will be as well to study the
statistics of the past five:

The 1967 annual report discloses a
number of minor but interesting facts:
(a) $2 million has been written off
properties held by Woolworths Pro-
perties Ltd., apparently because a
valuation made as long ago as 1955
“may have overstated” certain property
values.
(b) The market value of “Shares,
stock and convertible notes in: associ-
ated company listed on Stock Ex-
change” fell by $850,000 approximately,
or by about percent.
(c) The very small provision for
doubtful debts increased by 40 percent.
(d) The even smaller provision for
unearned income increased by nearly
80 percent.
Fact (a) accounts for the drop in
shareholders’ funds noted above and
fact (b) has no significance so far as
the various accounting ratios are con-
cerned. It is possible that (c) and (d)
indicate the growth in the “Big W”
stores’ business, for it would seem that
the extension of credit is a prime
requisite in department-store trading
today and “doubtful debts” and “un-
earned income suspended” are part
and parcel of credit accounts.
Woolworths has come a long way
since it was founded over 42
years ago and it is very surprising to
see the sales growth that has been
achieved in the past three years (sales
figures were disclosed for the first time
in 1964). The annual compound rate
of growth is about 12 percent on
average, which is about double the
rate at which Woolworths’ market
would seem to be expanding. It there-
fore follows that Woolworths has been
gaining a larger share of the market.
This involves the assumption that
“department-store type” sales were not
very large; although the Big W stores
commenced trading during 1964.
Some comment was excited in the
financial Press by the fact that the
net profit after tax represented only
2.4 percent of sales and that this did
not compare very favorably with the
major competitor. The figure has not
varied very much over the period that
sales have been disclosed. Similar con-
sistency occurs in a rather more satis-
factory ratio of trading profit to sales
(trading profit means net profit before
tax, depreciation, interest on long-
term debt, and auditors’ and directors’
fees, but excluding investment income):
Year to January 31 1964 1965 1966 1967
percentages 5.63 5.97 5.77 5.80
This trend is rather surprising, for
one would have expected some
economies with increasing sales volume
and a rising trend in net profit to sales.

A.P.M. Research looks
at a small world
Fibres in paper, micro-organisms in soil, the cellular structure of trees.
This is the world of the incredibly small that A.P.M. scientists are
investigating every day.
In the 1920’s Australian scientists set out to find a method of making
paper from Australian eucalypts. These methods are the basis of our
industry today and the pulping of hardwoods is now well established
in all paper-making countries.
The research being done today in A.P.M. laboratories will pay off in
better products, and greater industrial growth tomorrow.
A.P.M. is the leading paper maker in the southern hemisphere. It is
an Australian company owned by over 35,000 Australian investors, em-
ploying over 5,800 people in eight mills throughout the country.
A.P.M. is a forward thinking company which regards scientific research
as the basis of future progress.

average sales per store, a rising trend
is noticeable. In 1964/5 average sales
per store were about $357,000 and this
figure had increased by nearly 17|
percent to $419,000 in 1966/7.
Up to January 31, 1964, freehold and
leasehold land and buildings totalled
$55.7 million; there were 747 stores in
Australia, suggesting that the average
book value per store was about $75,000.
From 1964 to 1967, 100 stores were
added to the chain and the book value
of land and buildings increased by
$19.8 million, suggesting that the aver-
age cost of each new store was about
$198,000 more than two and a half
times the average cost at 1964.
These figures are very approximate,
because it has been stated in the annual
reports that the company makes the
fullest use of purchase/lease financing.
It is, however, likely that the conclu-
sion drawn is an accurate one. This
will mean that the main problem to
overcome is the cost of financing
development. From the 1962/3 year to
1966/7, prior charges, interest and
preference dividends have increased 43
percent on a pre-tax basis. The increase
represents about 5f percent of the
increase in the investment in land and
buildings alone and 0.91 percent of
the increase in sales value. It is likely
that when a purchase/lease agreement
is entered into, the rental may be low
in comparison with the rentals that
are charged to smaller shops, but it is
also likely that an escalation clause will
be included. That is, the rental will
increase with sales increases.
It is this cost of financing expansion
which makes it so difficult to assess
the probable trends in future earnings
per share. The most recent financing
was quite expensive, for it took the
form of a $7 million preference share
issue by Woolworths Properties Ltd.
The dividend rate was percent,
which would be the equivalent of pay-
ing about 11.3 percent interest at cur-
rent rates of tax. If the full preference
dividend had been paid in 1966/7, the
earning rate would have been about
one percent less.
Presumably, there will eventually be
a sustained pause in Woolworths’ ex-
pansion program and it will then be
interesting to see whether any reduc-
tion in the rate of growth of sales can
occur without slowing the growth in
net profit.
At the moment the market seems to
be acting with appropriate caution in
assuming that profit growth could well
be restricted to about 4 percent per
annum in the future. Even so, Wool-
worths (and Coles) remain good de-
fensive stocks and the risk of sub-
stantial variation in the suggested
growth rate seems quite slight.

An Oscar or two
for some
good performers
I'M SURE NO ONE will argue that
a screenful of Liz Taylor is a much
more enjoyable sight than a basketful
of share scrip. Both, however, are
equally capable of raising the blood
pressure with their performances.
Although the Exchange doesn’t have an
Oscar award, there are some stocks I
think deserve a mention for their roles
over the past year.
Consolidated Goldfields would cer-
tainly get the prize for the best market
performance by a novice. Anyone who
took up these shares at the $2.50 float-
off price could have made a profit of
$1.50 on the first day of listing. A
hard record to beat! The best market
performance by a veteran must surely
go to BHP. This great company
recovered $1.50 on price in the twelve
months and is still on the way up.
Western Titanium would certainly rate
a special award for profitability and
consistency. Its earnings have increased
substantially each year right through
the ’sixties. In fact, the past two were
doubles.
The tragic performer of the year
was Dickson Primer. Who would ever
have predicted that a loss would be
the result of its year’s work? Its
first-ever loss at that! As we now know,
a load of faulty materials was the
cause of the trouble. Never mind,
trading for the first three months of
the year is “satisfactory” and the
market has deigned to move the stock
back to par.
Away from last year’s performances
and back to a stock which looks cur-
rently interesting. The company is
James Wallace, the local pioneer of
the “Lift Slab” technique of multi-
storey building. Its shares have been
recently marked down by around ten
percent, presumably because of renewed
publicity in its dispute with the N.S.W.
Government over the re-development
of The Rocks.
Back in 1962/63 the Government
accepted the company’s tender for this
exciting undertaking, but then last year
it called the deal off. The reason was
money. The Premier claims he can’t
wait any longer for James Wallace to
supply the necessary financial guaran-
tees for the project. The company still
insists its contract is good and is now
considering what to do. Although I
don’t hold out any real hope for the
company in The Rocks deal, I still
think the shares are reasonable buying
at 18 cents; especially when January’s
report confirmed that all major con-
tracts were currently OK.
While brickmakers in most States
are hard-pressed to squeeze into their
yards because of the oozing stockpiles
of bricks, the reverse is the case in
Western Australia. Over there the
brick trade is working at full capacity
but still can’t keep up the supplies.
The much-heralded mineral develop-
ments in the North have set off a
building boom which is keeping ihe
local brickies flat out. On this basis
I thought Metropolitan Brick looked
rather cheap at 62 cents. I bought 300
in hopes of sharing in the bonanza.
Concrete Industries just doesn’t seem
to want to settle at par. Although
it did get back to taws for a very
brief spell one day last week, it is
now slowly sliding back down the
forties. Although I may be a bit pre-
mature, I decided to take my profit
and sold out at 47 cents.
My other sale this week was Latec.
I got 17 cents a share, which showed
me a profit of over 40 percent for just
one month’s investment.
Transactions for the week were:
BOUGHT
1500 James Wallace $O.lB $275
300 Metropolitan Brick $0.62 $l9O
SOLD
500 Concrete Ind. $0.47 $230
1000 Latec $0.17 $167
The account is still on the right side
of the ledger—s29l in credit.

Tin’s outlook grows hazy
for longer term
TIN IS ENJOYING a mild boom on
the London Metal Exchange at a time
when there are some doubts about the
longer-term outlook. Previously it had
been taken as certain that consumption
would stay well ahead of production
for several years, leaving U.S. stockpile
sales to fill the gap. Because the U.S.
release authorities recognise the £l2OO
a ton first support level established
by the International Tin Council, there
would have been little variation from
that price in the medium term.
The recent flurry, during which
prices moved above £1220, was due
mainly to a decline in LME stocks,
which caught traders by surprise. The
troubles in Nigeria, a major producer,
and in the vital South-East Asian
region would have also caused some
hedge buying.
Because consumers often cannot wait
for lower prices and because U.S.
releases are not on a straightforward
basis, prices could hold above the
£l2OO level—but not very far above.
That leaves the longer-term outlook
not so clear-cut.
Tin consumption has exceeded mine
production for more than eight years.
The deficit was first met by government
stock sales in the U.K., U.S., Italy,
and Canada, but the U.S. is now the
main factor. The gap in the past five
years has been: 1962, 18,500 tons; 1963,
21,000 tons; 1964, 22,000 tons; 1965,
16,000 tons; 1966, 11,000 tons.
(These figures are not universally
accepted, but the trend is similar in all
estimates, and the difference is only a
few thousand tons.)
Last year’s deficit of 11,000 tons
(consumption of 222,000 and produc-
tion 211,000) was less than expected,
reflecting strong lifts in production in
several countries, totalling 8000 tons,
and stagnant consumption. Including
15,500 tons from U.S. stocks, there was
a surplus for 1966 of 4500 tons or so.
However, the full effects of this were
not felt as Thailand held back supplies
of ore to provide a charge for new
smelting facilities. Stocks in Thailand
rose about 4000 tons.
Some forecasts of production and
consumption for 1967 indicate a 5000-
ton lift for both figures, leaving a steady
gap. But as the Thai smelters’ output
picks up and the backlog is eliminated,
actual supplies available to consumers
will be increased. Although the pro-
duction deficit may thus be less than
anticipated, it is not likely to disappear
completely.
The trends in consumption and pro-
duction will have an important bear-
ing on the future of tin prices. Pro-
duction, although stronger lately, does
not seem to be making any decisive
gains. Consumption, on the other hand,
could resume its growth after its recent
leveller trend.
As yet, none of the much-publicised
tin-free canning materials have made
much of a dent in tin’s markets. But
their existence has certainly taken much
of the growth prospect out of tin. So
far as can be seen at the moment, the
£l2OO barrier, backed by the large,
but by no means overwhelming, forces
of the International Tin Council, will
probably not be broken this year.
THE CHAIRMAN appealed for “a
more stable copper price at a level
which would encourage increased con-
sumption and still give efficient pro-
ducers a reasonable return.” Was this
said a week ago or a year ago? Was
the copper price above £stg.6oo and
rising or below £4OO and falling? The
answer is clearly “yes.” Actually,
Brigadier M. A. W. Rowlandson was
addressing the above remarks to share-
holders of the RTZ-controlled Palabora
copper mine earlier this month.
The distress of the two main copper
exporters, Chile and Zambia, is already
considerable with LME prices around
£360, and further falls will do more
than proportional harm—royalties and
surtax will be cut sharply. The Chilean
Treasury Minister recently announced
that the country may have to return
to the World Bank for aid. The Gov-
ernment’s decision last year to ask for
no more aid from the international
agencies “might have to be reviewed,”
he said. The country’s 1967 Budget
had been based on a price of £stg.36o
at minimum.
So the four major copper exporting
nations have decided to meet early in
June to discuss prices and marketing.
Zambia, Chile, Peru, and the Congo
(Kinshasha) will attend the confer-
ence, in Lusaka. (These four produced
1.7 million tons of the Western world’s
1965 output of four million tons.)
But the U.S., the West’s major pro-
ducer, will not be represented.
A Zambian spokesman said: “It is
intended to look after the consumer as
well as the producer.” Mr. Simon D.
Strauss, vice-president of American
Smelting and Refining, was quick to
state his opposition to any move that
did not allow for protection of con-
sumers. The four nations could prob-
ably impose their collective will for
a time on the consumers of the West-
ern world, notably in Europe, but sub-
stitution was an important long-term
factor for which allowances should be
made, he said.

More foreign companies
FOLLOWING LAST week’s article on
overseas companies interested in Aus-
tralian mining development, there still
remain a few more of such companies
which deserve a brief comment.
American Metal Climax Incorpor-
ated (in which Selection Trust owns
an 11.9 percent interest) has a capital
of SU.S.I2Om. in SU.S.IOOm. of pre-
ferred stock and 20m. ordinary
SU.S.I shares. Its profit for the nine
months ended September, 1965, was
SU.S.43m. Amax has a considerable
number of exploration and mining in-
vestments, which include a 46 percent
interest in Roan Selection Trust Ltd.,
a 35 percent interest in Canada Tung-
sten Mining Corporation Ltd., and
other investments in American Lithium
Chemicals Inc., Cerro Corporation, and
Palabora Mining Company Ltd. (8 per-
cent). From its own mines Amax pro-
duces and treats molybdenum, tung-
sten, uranium, vanadium, and potash,
it owns plants for the treatment of
copper, iron powder, zinc, and cad-
mium. Interests are also held in oil
and gas properties and aluminium,
Metals produced by the group also in-
elude lead, zinc, copper, and steel.
Amax is to take up a 25 percent in-
terest in the Mt. Newman iron ore
venture.

A FEW WEEKS ago our Chartist said
that the market for E. Z. Industries
did not look too bright and that holders
of the shares should take advantage of
any short-term recovery from prices
around $2.07 (that could go back up as
much as $2.40), because prices could
eventually decline to the $1.60 level.
But a Melbourne investment analyst,
who also makes use of charts in his
assessments, has suggested his clients
should buy the stock, even though his
chart seems to tell * the same story
as ours (except that he suggests there
is a support level around the $2 mark).
His main reasons for recommending the
stock are that it provides a high and
seemingly secure dividend yield of
about 8J percent combined with
moderate capital-gain prospects. He
admits that the stock lacks the glamor
of other base-metal miners (about one-
third of the zinc it produces at Risdon
comes from its own lead-zinc mine at
Rosebery and the rest is brought in
from Broken Hill), as its profitability is
largely dependent on zinc prices, which
have been, and should continue to be,
dull. But he argues that even though
E.Z.’s earnings are likely to fall again
in the current year, some respite could
come from the additional earnings from
one of its by-products, cadmium, and
from the Emu Bay Railway takeover.
In addition, E.Z. holds a 23 percent
interest, worth about $5O million, in a
huge slag dump at Port Pirie, which
contains an estimated one million tons
of zinc. But the market appears uneasy
about the likely financing of the com-
pany’s proposal to sink a second shaft
at Rosebery, involving about $7 million
in development. However, the Cowan
Investment people think that the group
could raise the money (from internal
cash flow, realisation of the slag dump,
or its substantial investment portfolio)
without reducing the dividend.


BOOKS
Journey to the Waste Land
By NORMAN TALBOT
The Georgian Revolt: Rise and Fall of
a Poetic Ideal, 1910-1922. Robert
H. Ross. Faber. $5.80.
IT IS A PITY this book is so neces-
sary. A workmanlike essay in literary
history should not be an eyeopener to
readers of poetry as this will be. The
trouble is that we all know what we
think about the Georgians—they aren’t
like Hopkins and Eliot (who are pro-
found and difficult) or the “War Poets”
and Hardy (who are unsentimental).
In fact, “Georgian” is a term of literary
abuse.
Professor Ross makes us realise the
silliness of this Eliot-based assumption,
as would any reading of Georgian
poetry in context. Like his predecessors,
beginning with Alec Waugh, Middleton
Murry, and Herbert Palmer, he dis-
tinguishes between the Georgians proper
and the Neo-Georgians, whose poetry is
more effectively described by our com-
mon assumptions about Georgian
escapism and glib prettiness. I tend
to blame Eliot for the confusion here,
since his critical name is sacred and
he made some of the initial accusations
about “pleasantness,” which he found
divisible in Georgian poetry between
“Wordsworthian” didacticism and
“Keatsian” decorative, playful, solemn
sweetness. In his review of one of the
best of the anthologies, “Georgian
Poetry III,” Eliot insisted that in either
variety “the Georgians caress every-
thing they touch.” This is ludicrously
inaccurate for describing war poems
like those of Sassoon, Graves, Rosen-
berg, and Nichols, which were printed
there, and almost as silly about the more
regular Georgians (those who had
appeared in the earlier anthologies).
What makes the review really amusing
is that Eliot exempts from his con-
demnation precisely the archetypal Neo-
Georgian poem that fits his description,
Squire’s “The Lily of Malud,” an exotic
lucent-siropy poem of the worst kind,
but which Eliot finds “an original and
rather impressive poem which deserves
better company.”
I find Ross’ discrimination proven,
but I wish he had shaped his book
around the three-part division that he
quotes from Robert Graves, one of the
many fine poets discovered by the
Georgian movement. Graves wrote to
Marsh from the front, pointing out
that Georgian Poetry was a plough
pulled by a Bull, a Camel, and an Ox.
The Bull is the group of original
Georgians who charged in two muscular
anthologies upon the moribund Edwar-
dian literary establishment. The Camel
stands for the war poets of comparable
stature with the Bull but in a sense
alien to it. The Ox is the emasculated
offspring of the Bull, not fit to be
harnessed to the same plough. I would
want to discuss Turner’s Ox-poetry fan-
tasies at more length, but the general
evaluation seems very accurate.
Professor Ross emphasises the vitality,
realism, newness, and directness of the
Bull poetry, linking the Georgian
revolt with such movements as Futur-
ism, Vorticism, and Imagism, but
claims that the Georgians were more
“Centre party” poets than radicals like
Pound and the Sitwells or reactionaries
like Squire (the chief Ox, assisted by
Turner, Freeman, and Shanks). They
reject Victorian poetry like the radicals,
feeling (to quote Pound) that poetry
should not “try to seem forcible by
rhetorical din, or luxurious riot”, but
their norm was “the language really
used by men” (to quote Wordsworth).
The dramatic sense of human speech
is a major aspect of Georgian poetry,
just as realism and precise observation
are. Their kind of irony comes from
subjective concerns linked with objec-
tive observation, and one of their major
attractions for their enormous audience
was the freshness and humanity of
their writing.
Sir Edward Marsh, private secretary
to Churchill through various ministries,
sounds an unlikely patron for the
aggressive and iconoclastic Bull, but
Eddie Marsh was their friend, editor,
and generous supporter. His aim in
printing the five “Georgian Poetry”
anthologies was not primarily to over-
throw a bunch of dead Victorian Great
Men but to provide for educated read-
ers like himself samples of a new, dir-
ect poetry, clear without tedium,
beautiful without falsity. The “strength
and beauty” he found in work by his
friends and contributors was real, and
he was courageous enough to follow
even the shocking realism of poems like
Bottomley’s effective “King Lear’s
Wife,” however much the critics
snarled. Unfortunately, the war’s dis-
ruption led him to play safe, to ignore
other writers of quality and freeze the
Georgians in the position of authority
their great public following had
entailed, without allowing them to
develop away from his image. They
T. S. Eliot
became a reactionary group before
gathering any fruits of their triumphant
revolt. Since only his taste was the
touchstone of suitability, and since he
enjoyed Squire, Turner, Freeman, and
the other Neo-Georgians, he eventually
handed the audience over either to
them or to Eliot’s obscurity (in both
cases the audience retreated fast). His
achievement should be a lesson to all
who expect poetry to command a large
audience, but the snobbery or intellec-
tualism that took over could not use
that achievement.
With realism, which normally tries
either to shock or to teach, is coupled
the most important Bull characteristic,
spiritual ebullience: D. H. Lawrence, a
typically individualistic Georgian, cried
as he rejected Edwardian dullness and
despair,. . we are awake again, our
lungs are full of new air, our eyes
of morning . . . This great liberation
gives us an overwhelming sense of joy."’
His voice is echoed by Gibson, Aber-
crombie, Davies, and Rupert Brooke,
who delighted in . . being even for
a moment alive in a world of real
matter (not that imitation gilt stuff
one gets in Heaven) and real people.”
Thus the Bull’s realism is exuberant
and confident, even if shocking.
It is ironic, even pathetic, that this
spirit should be abroad just before the
outbreak of World War I, but inability
to predict Is not the same as lack of
insight. It is from the shock, the ironic
rejection of hope, that the Camel de-
velops. The bubble world of Brooke’s
and Grenfell’s patriot-poet-soldier was
burst. There is white anger in Sassoon’s
“Counter-Attack,” horror in Nichols,
grim last-ditch endurance in Rosenberg
and Graves. “Realism” becomes some-
thing darker, more profound and more
uneasy, even more horrified than any-
thing in the Bull’s poetry.
Although Professor Ross is effective


because he stays within the Marsh-
Monro limits and talks only about the
Georgians who appeared in Marsh’s
anthologies, this is also the major fault
in his approach. A list of Georgian
poets might read well, and include
several poets (Gibson, Hodgson, de la
Mare, Bottomley, and Davies) whose
reputation should rise markedly, but the
later poets in the anthologies and those
who were never included at all are
often quite as classic Georgians. In-
deed, Edmund Blunden and Victoria
Sackville-West appeared late, while
Wilfred Owen, Robert Frost (disquali-
fied by nationality), Edward Thomas,
and Charlotte Mew weren’t printed by
Marsh at all, yet all belong to the first
rank of either Bull or Camel poets. I
hope a great many people read Profes-
sor Ross’ book (it is full of magnificent
quotations from the jousting factions,
especially by Edith Sitwell and Sir John
Squire) and that all of them then inves-
tigate the great wealth of poetry that
springs from the Georgian revolt. It is
delightful to realise the invalidity of
Marsh’s down-grading of the conflict
between the Eliot style and the Geor-
gian style in his last anthology (1922),
and to find the quality of the poetry
such that these comments are only
humorous:
Much admired modern work seems
to me, in its lack of inspiration and
its disregard of form, like gravy
imitating lava. Its upholders may
retort that much of the work which
I prefer seems to them, in its lack
of inspiration and its comparative
finish, like tapioca imitating pearls.
Floating world
By ELWYN LYNN

The 53 Stages of the Lokaido. Hiro-
shige. Edited Charles Terry. $11.17.
The Contemporary Artist in Japan.
David Kung. sls. East-West Centre
Press, Honolulu.
HOKUSAI, THE GENIUS, who re-
vived the popular wood-block print, felt
bitterly his eclipse, in the past 15 years
of his life, by the other 19th century
genius of the print, Hiroshige. Hiro-
shige illustrated the 53 stops on the
Emperor’s Road that winds 250 coastal
miles from Kyoto to Tokyo with such
attention to a variety of occupations
and popular pursuits that his views
were more easy on the soul, for, how-
ever diminutive Mount Fuji appears in
Hokusai, it’s always a symbol of perm-
anence, a gentle antidote to the love of
the topical, trivial, and transient.
In the face of these fine, remarkable
faithful prints in neat, pleasantly pre-
sented twin volumes, the rivalry seems
pointless, but they were purely com-
mercial products. Called ukiyo-e, “pic-
tures of the floating world,” they dealt
with ephemeral gaiety, reported on occu-
pations and illustrated experiences that
must have been common to many. A pop
art that was both art and popular they
were subject to the fickle changes of
taste. They had declined from their
magnificence at the end of the 18th
century and were rescued by Hokusai
and Hiroshige from banality.
The art of wood-block printing was
not a folk art; it was practised by tal-
ented and sophisticated artists; it was
not an adulterated fine art for mid-'
cult consumption, as Dwight Macdonald
describes our popular culture, but a
real art with mass appeal. Fine-art
snobbery in Japan led them to be dis-
missed as kitsch and they were prob-
ably only saved from oblivion by
Western interest after 1850.
This is odd in itself, for their brightly
piercing color and rigid lines are still
disliked by those who prefer the misty
grey-golden tones and feathery callig-
raphy of Eastern painting. The wood-
block prints probably looked exotic;
Jules Verne wrote “20,000 Leagues
Under the Sea” in 1870; Schliemann
had left the wholesale grocery business
in 1863 to locate Troy and Whistler,
and Gilbert and Sullivan were to
trivialise the Far East. Yet Hokusai’s
famous wave, poised above diminutive
boats, its crest breaking into talons, its
sea as hard as iron, appeared in 1834;
Turner’s aqueous amalgam of roman-
ticism and thence science, “Streamer
in a Snowstorm,” was painted in 1842.
By the end of the century exotic tastes
had been replaced by more purely
artistic ones, and in Gauguin’s “Jacob
Wrestling with the Angel” and “The
Yellow Christ” of 1889 large areas of
flat, emphatic colors have come right
from the Japanese wood-block; Lautrec
has sharpened the forms of the poster
and Van Gogh has recast Hiroshige’s
“Plum Tree Garden of Kameidu” and
has written to Gauguin: “The very
lines of Hokusai send a cry through
us.”
Actually there’s little for the rhap-
sodic expressionists in these prints; at
present the simplicity of line and the
bright, sour, and lucid color might wean
young painters from the luxurious tones
of a Matisse and rehabilitate art as the
analysis of form. If modern artists
were asked to do 35 landscapes, each
with Mount Fuji in it, they would
start pulling out their Creative Workers
union cards; what Hokusai does is
amazing. Fuji is sometimes a plastic
parallel to waves, rooftops, carves of
boats and bridges, fishing lines, cliffs,
and long diagonal ascents; sometimes,
as in Cezanne, it moves the horizon
closer to the foreground. (The dis-
tance between Mount Fuji and Mont
Ste Victoire is not so great; sometimes
it’s a focal point as when it is seen
through a giant barrel. Lightning plays
about the base of a red mottled Fuji in
a storm and Red Fuji is just that. One
of the 36 views has no Fuji at all.
It’s like Duchamp putting a moustache
on the Mona Lisa, then, having rubbed
it out, writing “Mona Lisa Rasee” be-
low.)
Some of the prints are quite gaudy,
some beautifully cool in lucid greens
and blues on cream, and these have an
unusual atmospheric distance. The
notes, which are informative and
aesthetically relevant in both volumes,
tell us that in the icy colors of “Seven
League Beach” Hokusai came his
closest to the drifting distance of Sino-
Japanese painting, but like Hiroshige
he’s more concerned with busy life be-
fore him.
Hiroshige is generally less dramatic,
his color more subdued, his outline less
crisp and unresilient: one of his fam-
ous prints is a snow scene and he liked
the silhouettes of misty forms. He sees
the world as a procession, with few
focal or climactic points. Sketchily
topographical, his scenes depict engag-
ing and humorous incidents that Hoku-
sai would have thought inessential. On
the other hand, Hiroshige can be car-
ried away by formalised metaphors: the
Mountains of Odawara are like a pile
of stones, a stony hill rears like a wave
and he twists and tortures the rock at
Okitsu into an intricate design purely
for its own sake.
River-crossing panoramas and the
long, slow curve of the wooden bridge
at Okazaki suit his manner better, for
here the sharply observed incidents set
up, as with' Hokusai, an intriguing
play between grand design and tran-
sient minutiae, all the more remark-
able when one recalls that these prints
were only about eight by eleven inches.
They afford all kinds of enjoyment
and reveal an age without anxiety,
before Hiroshima and when the peasant
could have an original print to be
peeped at in its folder.
In David Kung’s excellently produced
book, full of fine plates, all that appears
to survive of the style of the popular
wood-block is in the adaptation of
Western pop’s hard, flat colors and
tough outlines in Isobe and Okamoto
and in the inventive prints of Ikeda,
who’s a little like a Japanese Hockney.
Though Kung is, in his introduction,
mainly concerned with the assimilation
of Western modes since 1945, and
though he says abstract-expressionism is
taking root it’s yielding little harvest
elsewhere he is vague about its
genesis in Japan and makes no real
attempt to relate it to Japanese callig-
raphy, and one lone artist is allowed to
speak for the Gutai Group’s develop-
ment of non-literary calligraphy. (He
allows his thirty-five artists to state their
claims, some weird, some full of cliches
about self-expression and freedom, but
most sensitively introspective.)
Kung shows how tradition in Japan
lies like an alp on the minds of some
of the artists and how revolutionary
was the adoption of oil painting;
though he acknowledges the usefulness
of tradition to many modern artists, he
does not indicate how it works, for he
has no notion of how artists are caught
up in movements and says the younger
generation is free to choose between the
art of the East and West. They don’t

always choose well, and even if Kung’s
book is an invaluable document:, I
should like him to tackle the views of
a midle-of-the-roader, like Furuta,
whom he quotes: “The present situation
in the Japanese art world is chaotic.
Neither the critics, the artists, the col-
lectors, nor the public have any firm
convictions . . . Indeed, Tokyo has been
a dumping ground for all bad Western
art of the last two decades.”
How refreshing it is to re-examine the
convictions of Hokusai and Hiroshige
in an art atmosphere where to have con-
vinced attitudes is a sign of naivety and
narrowness.
Disgusted doodles
By LES TANNER
Gerald Scarfe’s People. Peter Owen.
$9.80.
THE MARVELLOUS thing about a
sheet of white paper is that you can
cover it with black lines. You can
write on it with a pen, smear it with
charcoal, divide it into significant areas,
or just doodle. Gerald Scarfe doodles.
Paul Klee called it taking a line for a
walk, although in Scarfe’s case it is
more like the silver trail of a sticky
but elegant snail.
Scarfe is one of the greatest still-life
drawers of body bits since Hieronimus
Bosch. But the point is they are “still
lives.” The very silly thing is that he
has been hailed as the great searing
conscience. The veritable satirist. The
new Gillray. How can you take a
satirist seriously who lavishes the same
loathing on Berlin and New York?
Who treats the WHOLE world as if it
were made up of Belsen guards? I know
we are all responsible, but (and I think
it is a reasonable but) there should be
surely some extra venom reserved Jor
those who actively participate.
Scarfe’s love affair with his drawings
does produce horrified disgust, but only
because he cannot resist the logic of
his exaggerations. Thus, since Mick
Jagger’s lips are big and full, they
flower and bloom like an obscene
clam’s mantle. Then Scarfe follows the
logic of his line, and you are given a
figure who surely should be locked
away in an institution lest he take
the nearest teenage fan and submit her
to the dreadful rituals of Christie. I
just can’t believe we are all perpetra-
tors because we are capable.
Scarfe needs permanent disaster for
his horror reflex to have a base. I think
the essence of Scarfe is beauty. He is
a superlative line man, his respect is
for the line, its weight and its descrip-
tive power; its flexibility is wonderful.
He has Aubrey Beardsley’s regard for
beauty of line, but I think none of
Beardsley’s awareness of obscenity.
The probability is that we shall be
defined and flayed by an artist who
likes the lines he draws and really
doesn’t care much what they define.
Pavese's power
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Summer Storm. Cesare Pavese. Peter
Owen. $4.25.
SEVENTEEN YEARS after his suicide,
unpublished MSS by Cesare Pavese are
still breaking into print. The present
collection of early short stories, a num-
ber of which were not even published
in his own country until recently, has
lost nothing for having been salted
away for upwards of 30 years; if any-
thing, now that we know the end of
the journey, many have gained in al-
most unbearable poignancy, just be-
cause they can be read as desolate mile-
stones pointing the way to ultimate
tragedy.
These are all vignettes of Pavese’s
youth, whether projected into an illu-
sory, nightmarish old-age, as in “The
Evil Eye,” or probing into the painful
turmoil of awakening sexuality in “First
Love,” or experiencing the terrible per-
verted pleasure of the six-year-old in
“Free Will,” wallowing in “self-pity like
a sponge soaking up water,” pleased
at being punished because then he would
feel “beyond all hope,” deliciously
aware that the entire world existed only
to torture him.
It is easy to see here why the
hypersensitive author believed that
man’s whole life was only an extension
of his childhood, that people do not
change but are destined to repeat their
mistakes over and over again, and
that every person is like a delicate piece
of engineering with a stress-point de-
termined at birth, beyond which he
can never venture without breaking.
As the excellent translator Alma
Murch explains in her introduction,
these stories were purposely selected
from the pile of MSS found after
Pavese’s death, to reveal “the gradual
development of the author’s most
trenchant characteristics,” the strongest
of which was what he himself called
charity toward our fellow man. This
most emphatically did not include
charity toward our fellow woman.
Pavese was a confirmed misogynist, his
female figures are invariably amoral,
hard as steel, calculating professionals
like Mina in “The Idol” or vulgar
amateurs like Nora in “The Leather
Jacket,” or cold betrayers like Natalina
in the ironically titled “Loyalty.” (This
was the original version of the theme
Pavese later expanded and incorporated
into his novel “The Comrade.”)
Even stylistically, the crisp, straight-
forward, understated sentences, no
doubt influenced by the American writ-
ers whom Pavese admired as a student
and first translated into Italian as a
noted scholar, are so clean cut and so
free of the frills of fashion that they
have already taken on a patina of time-
less inevitability.


Spook stories
by JOHN BAXTER
The Insanity of Jones and Other
Stories. Algernon Blackwood.
Penguin. 85 cents.
THIS PENGUIN contains a represent-
ative selection of Blackwood’s work
from the period 1906-1910. They are
among his first stories, but though he
continued writing to his death in 1951
he was never to surpass them. Black-
wood was born in England but lived in
America most of his life. The stories
collected here were written when he
was in his late thirties, perhaps close
to the time when he began to lose
touch with what he remembered of his
birthplace.
Blackwood, like Dreiser, understood
the terror of the impersonal city, the
despair of life in a lonely room. One
of the longest and best 'stories in this
collection, “The Listener,” is mainly
a chilling study of an unsuccessful
writer struggling to hold out against
poverty and failure. The rather con-
ventional ghost story that Blackwood
has grafted on to this picture provides
an odd but effective counterpoint to
the exposition of growing depression.
“The Insanity of Jones” is similar in
its evocation of the desperation and
fantasy that can exist in a simple
business office, but despite its grisly
homages to “The Pit and the Pendu-
lum” it does not approach “The
Listener” in impact.
The other city-set stories share the
polish of “The Listener” but tend for
the most part to be slight. “Max
Hensig” is reminiscent of Ben Hecht’s
classic “The Bum” in its picture of
life as a newspaper reporter in a big
American city, but lacks Hecht’s
sorrowful compassion. The insane bac-
teriologist who hunts the young re-
porter, a germ-tainted needle in his
pocket ready to prick him, is one step
past the bounds of reason, although
the New York background is impec-
cably drawn.
It is in the remaining stories, how-
ever, that Blackwood shows his talent.
These are classic tales, reprinted occa-
sionally in anthologies of horror
stories but seldom given such a wide
circulation as this. “The Willows,”
“The Wendigo,” “May Day Eve,”
“The Camp of the Dog,” these are
stories that, by any objective standard,
must be judged among the world’s
best. Nobody, except perhaps E. M.
Forster in his short Grecian fantasies,
has come so close to imposing on
natural phenomena a scheme of super-
natural activity that coincides quite so
closely with observable evidence.
Blackwood conceived all life in terms
of barriers to perception. “The major-
ity of people,” he says, “go past the
doors that are half ajar, thinking them
closed, and fail to notice the faint
stirrings of the great curtain that hangs
ever in the form of appearance between
them and the world of causes behind.”
In some of the stories, we apprehend a
character’s experience through a veil
of confusion, fear, or madness. In
others, especially those set outdoors, the
veil is an over-civilised lack of per-
ception that disappears slowly under
the influence of natural forces.
Blackwood believes in the elementals,
the forces of wind, fire, and water that
inhabit all nature. In all the outdoor
stories, these forces appear briefly, show
their strength, then disappear again
behind the veil. Of all these stories,
“The Willows” is without doubt the
greatest. A perfect evocation of the
wind-blown marshes of the Danube, it
succeeds in making believable the pos-
sibility of elemental forces that can des-
troy men. “The Wendigo,” set in the
Canadian woods, is a chilling re-
creation of an Indian fable about a
mythical beast that takes up doomed
men and runs with them through the
tree-tops.
At The Night Cafe
That flickering scopitone: hard images
Of girls darting on sand, yacht sails driven
By artificial wind. Hooray for love!
A plastic paradise. Slow rocking hammocks,
Straws piercing fizzy glasses, muffled
Waves beating on the ravished inner ear,
Drinks tall and cool on a sunlit patio,
Only suave figures admitted to the hall,
Fountains of light bursting off metal chairs.
Irruptions of green water from lion mouths,
Sparkling to the band’s insistent jig
While arms wave slowly, regularly as palms.
Perfectly smooth each metronomic gesture;
Spelled out in neon every silver name,
Unshrill and level messages, thin smiles,
All are contained, and sweet as sucaril.
Even animals, made neat, behave within;
No foaming jaws, no parched and nervous rutting,
But sleek divisions in a field of green
Heraldic, stationary, poised. Each flash
Of lightning, bang of thunder crisply stilled.
The frame is grey, yet colored with delight
And brimmed with joy, the humans that parade
Flags cool and flapping, limbs of beaten gold.
No sound disturbs, no insect stings, no wind
Save a remote and curling thing. Blue sky,
Blue ocean. Outside in the scratched cafe,
Littered with dusk’s detritus, scored with despair,
We watch, obediently registering.
“It moves, it swings!” Oil is poured on our waters,
“Take my hand now.” “You’ll dance?” Out on the floor
Awkward, alive, mocked by dead images
We tremble, trapped apart by the fact we feel.

The B.H.P.
Thanks for an excellent article on
BHP (8., April 15). Its writer deserves
credit. One small quibble . . . the
“two-men-at-the-top idea” is not, in
fact, all that recent. Back in 1955 Pro-
fessor Peter Drucker, in his classical
“The Practice of Management,” wrote:
“The chief executive job in every busi-
ness (except perhaps the very smallest)
cannot properly be organised as the
job of one man. It must be the job
of a team of several men acting to-
gether.”
He also quoted a 1954 report of
a research study for a leading bank
which asked “Are there any earmarks
which will tell us whether the manage-
ment of a company is good or bad?”
The eventual answer: “If the salary
levels of the four or five men at the
head of the ladder are all close
together, then the performance and
morale of the entire management group
is likely to be high.”
It’s worth taking you up on this
point because it helps illustrate a defect
which is frequently seen in Australian
business administration: we tend to
apply the lessons the Americans have
learned too late.

End of the Affair
Undoubtedly the author of “The
End of the Affair” (8., April 8) was
right when he said that Britain and
Australia are drifting apart. He
assumes, however, as all Australians
do, that Australia is a young, vigorous,
and rising nation, Britain an old and
declining one. But is Australia really
a young country? Is it not rather the
last outpost of a decaying Western
civilisation, standing as ancient colonial
Britain stood to ancient Imperial
Rome?
When Rome could no longer defend
her Empire, she withdrew her soldiers
from Britain; this action was followed
by the appeal “Send back the
Legions!”
As in ancient Rome, the British are
anxious to rid themselves of the
Empire which once made them so
proud. The Romans of the Decline and
Fall thought more of the result of a
chariot race than of the loss of a
province: the British are more inter-
ested in football pools, the Australians
in cricket matches, than in the
imminent peril in which they stand.
Are we really a part of Asia, as we
have suddenly discovered ourselves to
be? Culturally and racially we are
certainly European; but we are busily
engaged in letting the yellow man in
with a vengeance, to exploit our
resources under the benign name of
co-operation.

The A.I.C.D. and
Demonstrations
In your article “A Step Back Toward
the Political Wilderness” (8., April 8)
you refer to AICD as a “Communist
front” and claim that it was respon-
sible for various violent demonstra-
tions including those during the last
Federal election campaign.
Unfortunately any organisation
opposed to Australian military partici-
pation in the Vietnam war is called a
“Communist front” by a large section
of those who support this participation.
Polls have repeatedly shown that 33
percent of the Australian electorate
oppose the commitment of Australian
troops to the Vietnam war. I am
among that 33 percent.
I cannot speak for any other peace
organisation but as one who opposes
Communism or any other totalitarian
system of government and as one who
supports a liberal democratic society
such as exists in Australia today, I
believe that AICD is neither a front
for the Communist Party or any other
organisation for that matter.
It is an unfortunate trend that dis-
ruption of political meetings and even
acts of violence at political meetings
are becoming more common. AICD has
opposed violence at all times and is
alarmed at this trend. AICD neither
incited nor supported those who acted
violently at Mr. Holt’s election meet-
ing last November.

Print Editions
Mr. H. J. O’Mara has been misin-
formed (8., April 8). Gallery A has
not “shut down its presses.” The
activities of Gallery A workshop have
been transferred to Sydney and ex-
panded to include silk-screen and
etching processes. The production in
Gallery A workshop Melbourne in the
past four years has been primarily
concerned with the production of edi-
tions commissioned by the National
Gallery Society of Victoria and further
editions by Leonard Hessing, Russell
Drysdale, Donald Friend, Colin
Lanceley, and Charles Blackman.
Janet Dawson’s experience in Euro-
pean ateliers was indispensable in this
work. When Miss Dawson moved to
Sydney to concentrate solely on her
painting I found it impossible to get a
suitable edition printmaker in the
southern city, several of whom were
available in Sydney. Thus the print
workshop has been transferred to Pad-
dington and is now in operation. Now
that South Yarra and Crossley Galleries
have joined in this activity there will
be a large range of original graphics
available in this country, a state of
affairs which will bring Australia closer
into line with the U.K. and America.

No Gammon
We are preparing for publication an
anthology entitled “Aliens In Their
Land,” a collection of short stories
about the life and role of the Aborigine
in contemporary Australian society. The
anthology is edited by Professor Louise
Rorabacher.
Included in the anthology will be
a short story, “No Gammon,” by Stan
Parkes, published in 1945. Perhaps one
of your readers may know something
of Mr. Parkes or could give his present
address? If so, would they write to
Cheshire’s, 380 Bourke St., Melbourne.

Tun Adbul Razak
With reference to the remarks (8.,
April 15) attributed to the Deputy
Prime Minister, Tun Abdul Razak, in
the last paragraph of the article
entitled “Malaysia’s Tun Abdul Razak:
a quiet, methodical egalitarian,” I am
directed to categorically deny that such
a statement was ever made by him.
Under the Constitution, the Rulers
are heads of their respective States
while the Yang di-Pertuan Agong
(King) is sovereign head of the Federa-
tion. Their powers and prerogatives
are clearly defined. As their position is
unquestionably guaranteed under the
Constitution, which is the supreme law
of the land, the Deputy Prime Minister
could not have made such a disloyal
and irresponsible statement.
