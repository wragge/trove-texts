A Poet Clad in Klondyke Furs.
“ I want to answer through The Criterion,”
said Joaquin Miller, “a question people have
often asked me: why I always write in little bits
of Bible Saxon words. I claim that this is the
only American literature. It is the American
character. The British character is slow, stolid,
substantial. When we imitate the ponderous Dr.
Johnson or the majestic Milton it is not American,
not a word of it. Why, there is not a good busi-
JOAQUIN -MILLER.
ness man in America who will write a long letter
or use a big word if he can help it. Our best real
American literature, so far, is found in our business
letters, advertisements and concise telegrams.
‘ I resent the idea, however, ” continued Mr.
Miller, “that this is a mere age of money-getting
and that we are all material. The poet who
starves to-day is not a true poet, for a true poet is
a true man and not afraid to lay his hand to the
plow and sing as he plows, like Kipling or Burns.
There never were so many American poets as to-
day ; millions of them, all at happy firesides. The
one great American poet who is no more is Edgar
Allan Poe, the American Barnahy Budge. As
for myself ? Yes, I think I am not only an
American poet, but The American poet. I have
adhered to American scenes and themes, and done
all my work on the spot spoken of. Chiefest of
all, I have written all the time in brief, terse and
the simplest Saxon, coining my work to American
quick and earnest action. Of course, we have
great poets of sentiment, passion, and so on, but
these are not American alone; they are of the
universe, their themes universal.
“ Most American literature is really only English
literature. We have plenty of good brain and
Eoetic thought, but we nearly all run to words,
lg English words.
“The first thing a small poet does is to go
gunning for big words* Words do not live.
Words are only the leaves of the tree, not the
tree, not the thought. Words may be beautiful,
but they are born to die.
“A true poet will make the presence of thought
known by the absence of words. A poem that
depends on sounding words for effect, be they
never so stately and sonorous, may be very good
music, but it cannot be enduring poetry. The
one thing that will mark the American poet as dis-
tinct from the British poet will be his brevity, his
rush, action, his scorn of words, words, words.
Greece is but a little place ; Athens you can
cover with a pin’s head on the map ; but she loved
the beautiful, and out of this love blossomed her
poets and philosophers. She lives, while Babylon,
for all her gold and glory, is not. The city of
Solomon loved the beautiful. Jerusalem had
poets ; Jerusalem, the flower-garden and olive-
land of thought, gave the world more true poetry
than all the world besides, and in the fewest
words. We must cast off the bondage of words, as
the Bible did. Words, words, words ! Hang
your hall with all the war implements of all the
world, past or present, but when you go down to
battle with some giant wrong, another boastful
Goliath, remember the boy David ; he chose only
a sling and a pebble from the brook, but he knew
the use of his one weapon. I am asking no one
to lay aside the book of men. A life without
books would be a dinner without bread.
I only ask that you love not the books of men
less but the book of Nature more. I beg you
remember Shakespeare’s scorn for words, words,
words. It was the short Roman sword that went
to the heart, not the long, boastful one of the
barbarian. Buddha, who counselled us to be
" a PPy> wrote no book ; Confucius, no book; and
the Teacher of all teachers only the line or syllable
in the sand. His lessons were of the book of
Nature, His alphabet the birds of the air, the lilies
of the field, the rose of Sharon, the cedars of
Lebanon. But His simple and sublime lessons have
lived and will live always because they were
natural, and went to the heart like the short
Roman sword ; went to the brain as did the little
pebble of the boy David, The Teacher of all
teachers used the fewest and shortest words of all.
If I have, tried to follow His lessons in literature,
and have been cut down time and again under all
sorts of circumstances—what matter ? The end of
it all, as with all things, must be left with Time,
God’s first-born.”
Who is this Joaquin Miller that dares thus to
beard in their lair?
Years ago, before Francis Bret Harte and Henry
James became exiles from home, he was the
literary lioli of London, he, an American, by all
that was wonderful.
Child-wise, Sierra-souled poet that he was, he
was shrewd enough to dress the part spectacularly.
He knew that the Mrs. Leo Hunters and the
Mrs. Ponsonby Joneses would care nothing for a
transatlantic echo of London civilised aesthe-
ticism. So lie gave them a red shirt and top-boots
and a wide felt hat. He was the Spirit of ’Forty-
nine, the poetic embodiment of the Californian
pioneer.
And London, delighting to consider America a
wilderness Of uncivilisation, threw its drawing-
rooms wide open to Joaquin Miller. His open-
throated shirt, his topboots, and his tawny mane
blazed a trail of success through the modem
Babylon that no other American has equalled.
Nor is that success likely to be surpassed. The
American miner, tho cowboy, the Texas ranger,
and all the other types of our aforetime picturesque-
ness are fading from to-day’s canvass, and London
does not care about conventionally decorous poets
from America. Thomas Bailey Aldrich may be
the best-dressed man in Boston, but London is
surfeited with fine folk. It can have a well-
dressed poet for dinner every week in the year.
But a Joaquin Miller, vivid with the garb of the
miner, and musical with the poetry he had fused
from the Sierras, was a lion to make glad the jaded
spirit of London society.
Now, years afterwards, Joaquin Miller comes to
New York. He coines, as once he came to London,
as a miner, but the shirt and top-boots of the
1< orty-mner have given way to the furs and Indian
of the Alaskan pioneer. He comes, an
old man now, as the poet seer of the Farthest
North known to American gold-mining. He
comes to tell the millions that go to music halls
the truth and the poetry of the Klondyke. He
whom Europe still holds high as the greatest of
American poets, conies to New York, the town
that flings honors and dollars upon the whelps
from London’s cage of literary lions, not as the
loudly-heralded pet of a publishing house,- the
vaunted star of a mighty magazine, the sought-
after favorite of the millionaires who dominate
x ifth Avenue ; but—merely as a popular enter-
tainer.
For that is how America rewards its poets.
I his drab material age of ours thinks it has
little use for poetry. Ah, but does it never stop
to realise that poetry has worth, both spiritual
and actual, far exceeding riches from the Mint ’
'y hen Ambrose Bierce wrote once, that “ Miller’s
glowing lines are worth to California their number
in ingots of gold,” he wrote the truth. And how
has California, and all the rest of America, repaid
the debt ? It has driven him from his home on
the Heights, near Oakland, to take up the rdle of
the troubadour. Yet who shall say that the music
of the adventurer and the troubadour is not as
great as the music of the hermit ?
lor years Joaquin Miller, barring some excur-
sions to Hawaii, has lived in an almost inaccessible
cottage on the crags near Oakland. From time to
time his face and lion-mane have appeared in
San Francisco, and from time to time the world
has heard some such fine poem as that, for in-
stance, of the fishermen who quarrelled by the
*]• j of Como, “ and who shall say but that he
•n ' • Cal ! fornia , growing callous to the genius
still within its gates, either forgot the hermit of
Oakland, or else told gibes about him. He wrote
a poem on “ Christ,” and the jesters reported him
replying to one solicitous about the poem, “Judas
could sell his Christ, but no one seems to want to
buy mine. ”
Then came the marvellous tales men toid of the
Klondyke. The spirit of ’Forty-nine came again
upon the aging poet, and he went forth to see.
The perils he braved, the wonders he saw, he is
now telling from behind the footlights. He comes
upon the stage, a splendid, picturesque figure of a*
T he head and beard are massive, shaggy
with hair that has a touch of grey in its tawnyness.
The moustache curls fiercely upwards and the eyes
gleam keen with the youth that never dies. A
fur garment, grey and black, reaches to the thighs,
and the feet are encased in Indian boots of the
same fur, double everywhere, and turned over at
the top, halfway to the knee, with tassels hanging
down. _ ° &
The voice is in a curiously flat minor ; there are
Rs that you never hear in the East, R’s that
have something of the Far West, and yet some-
thing of the South ; the vowels are as thin as the
Londoner’s are broad. The manner of the man is
half shy, half filled with the splendor of the story
he has to tell. He moves about the stage ner-
vously, now fingering his coat as he explains the
absolute necessity of it, now lifting a little ingot
of gold from the table in front of him, now losing
himself in the scenic beauty of what he saw in the
Arctic regions, now giving a humorous touch to
the lack of comforts in the Klondyke. He sums
the matter up briefly, as far as material things go.
No goldfields in the world were ever so rich as
those of the Klondyke, but no other gold ever en-
tailed such hardships in the mining. For the
perils of the journey he has a splendid, quiet,
poetic eloquence. He has no words fine enough
m praise of the men who are making Dawson ; the
cowards and the knaves, he declares, never get
that far. He tells of how he found all the
wonder tales true, and how, having seen, he began
the return journey. And then the poet in him
speaks, as he gives a picture of how the Northern
Night gave place, after many days, and many
deaths, to Day. You must have mighty little
poetry in your soul if the voice, of this poet, tell-
ing in his musical prose, the tale of that arctic
transfiguration, doe% not stir you deeply.
The listeners, whether conscious or not that the
voice is the voice of a century-end troubadour, keep
a straining silence that comes rarely to a music-
hall. This minstrel from the Far West Is teaching
the heedless thousands of tho Esvst the beauty and
the poetry of the American continent. When the
spell is over and the furclad poet bows in simple
fashion as he leaves the stage, the applause that
comes is a veritable tempest telling of the triumph
of the Muse over the Material.
Lately, in the sunshine of one of those fine fore-
runners <pf our springtime this childlike genius
was walking on Fifth Avenue. Against the splen-
did towers that held the portentous publishing-
houses the figure of this slouch-hatted, velvet-
trousered poet was like a protest. He wandered
slowly, his head thrown back to take in the stony
coldness of the skyward buildings. But for the
fire in his eye, the something powerfully vital in
his face and frame, you would have said this was a
rustic wondering at the sights of the town. When
we met, he asked me about his performance. Had
he done well ? He had been nervous ; he was
always nervous. We wandered on, in the sun-
shine, talking;
When I left him his slow'steps turned towards
the Waldorf. It occurred to me that his being a
guest of the Astor hostelry was at least one happy
note in the somewhat pathetic spectacle of a great
poetic genius entertaining the masses from the
platform. For there are millions of people to
whom the ability to lodge at that hotel spells all
their ideas of success in the world.
T. KINSLEY, in THE CRITERION.
C. Hoey : Now, I think ringer originated
from the custom, in the early days of the merino, of
appointing' the best and speediest shearer as timekeeper
to ring the bell for sinoke-oh and meals. There was no
phalanx of bosses in “them days,” and the squatter
knew his men personally, and was able to pick the best
chap for the office. Moreover, this bell-ringer had the
advantage over an aspiring rival that'he could time him-
self to catch a monkey just when the other man was
finishing off, and then rinsj time, thus one sheep
ahead -for no one is allowed to catch sheep after the bell
has rung. This manoeuvre, repeated three or four limes
a day, generally sufficed to down dangerous rivals and
maintain the ringer in his position as fastest shearer in
the sued.
Aubrey Beardsley.
n**T, Beardsley was a pictorial Swedenborg,
lhe soul of a flea was as perceptible to him as to
the artist-poet Blake, whose weird spiritual
imaginings have taxed the exegetical ingenuity of
ail lus editors down to Ellis and Butler Yeats;
but with this difference—Blake was a seer, a clair-
voyant, a dreamer of dreams: Beardsley, in his
own phrase, never allowed himself to see visions
except on paper, and in this we get the full value
ot his decorative sanity, the absolute subservience
or his mental conception to his completed design.
f, 01 “ he sake of readily-suggested comparison,
therefore, we may accept Beardsley as a latter-
aa”n- 1 l Blake, perhaps, possessed by a
pallid passion that exhausts without staying—the
depictor of the desire of the anaemic woman pre-
maturely satiated, who houses the soul of the
succubus in a too-frail tenement of clay. Beards-
ley s female forms are walking shrouds of burnt-
out longings—decadent figures of asbestos-spirits
exiled from a grotesque paradise. Yet we
are compelled to admit the creator who out of
deiormity spiritualises a subtle grape, formulates
the canons of artistic distortion, and images forth
a totality of beauty from the elements of ugliness.
* * * *
Beardsley, feeling his way to his own individual
expression, passed under influences as varied as
opposed. In the admirable designs to the “Morte
d Arthur, the leading influence is that of Burne-
J 01 ? e - ln Ins illustrations to the “Yellow Book ”
and, less emphatically, to the “ Savoy,” Japanese
art exercises sway. Erench art of the eighteenth
Ce ?i t \Ar n‘\ 1 l < tkeart . of Baris exemplified by Cheret
and VViuette, have in turn governed phases of his
development, but he was one who always subdued
his material, no matter whence seized, to a treat-
ment so exclusively the treatment of Beardslev
that his drawings may claim originality of the
of n n< ; artist died in i'iie bosom
of the Church, at the age of twenty-six. Con-
sider one remarkable aspect of this remarkable
young man s ability, genius—what you will • his
extreme youth ! He is like one of those faery
children who lived long lives before they were
bom, and came to the earth in a hurry simply to
record their experiences of an ageless pre-natal
existence Arthur Symons, the rhapsodical cele-
brant of the cult of the Beardsleyites, visions him
as one. who must go on a journey before noon, and
who hastens to finish the small measure of life
remaining to him before a snatched luncheon. He
seems to have been born with all the faculties and
no small measure of the accomplishments. He
MPn * r f n n h a , lmos T t T as earl y as John Stuart
Mill learnt Greek He was a pianist before he
had ever drawn aline, a witty conversationalist, a
man of wide and curious reading. He fondly
wished to be considered a “man of letters ” (actu-
ally described himself as such on a library admis-
sion ticket), and undertook an essay on Les
Liaisons Dangereuses; wrote stanzas having a
certain out-of-the-way cleverness for the “ Savoy ”
and began a curious story, in the manner of’a
parody by Lafargue, on the subject of Venus and
lannhauser. We get a curious little note of the
rather self-conscious, would-be “man-of-letters ”
haunting concert-rooms with a “large, gilt-leather
portfolio with the magnificent, old, red-lined folio
paper, which he would often open, to write some
lines m pencil.
9 * * *
As already stated, Beardsley’s short life ended
in complete reconcilement with the Mother
Oliureh. Symons tells of the young artist’s last
days
It was on the balcony of the Hotel Henri IV., at Arques
one of those September evenings, that I had the only
quite serious, almost solemn, conversation I ever had with
Beardsley. Not long before we had gone together to
- x andre Dumas yds at Pu} 7 , and it was from talking
thoughtfully, but entirely,.of that Parisian writer, and
his touching, in its unreal way so real, Dame aux
trZflT. (the not th e play), which Beardsley
admired so much, that we passed into an unexpectedly
intimate mood of speculation. Those stars up yonder,
whether they were really the imprisoning worlds of other
creatures like ourselves ; the strange ways in which the
soul might have come and must certainly go ; death, and
the future : it was of such things that I found him
speaking, for once without mockery. And he told me
then a singular dream or visionAvhich he had had when a
child waking up at night in the moonlight and seeing a
great crucifix, with a bleeding Christ, falling off the wall,
where certainly there was not, and had never been
any ciucinx. It is only by remembering that one conver-
sation, that vision, the tone of awe with which he told it,
that I can, with a great effort, imagine to myself the
Beardsley whom I knew, with his so positive intelligence,
his miaginafve sight of the very spirit of man as a thing
of definite outline, transformed finally into the Beardsley
who died in the peace of the last sacrament of the Church
holding the rosary between his fingers.
Of his art, little in this brief Note can be touched
upon. The weird illustrations of “Salome” are
however, exceedingly typical and representative’.
1 he drawing of the dancing daughter of Herodias,
receiving from the hand of the executioner the
bleeding head of John the Baptist on a charger,
■is one of the most appallingly significant. Here
the very soul of the woman glints out of her evil
eyes. And the composition, how powerful !
with its table-like suggestion furnished by the
black, hairy arm of the headsman, holding aloft
the huge, flat dish with its bloody trophy ! The
decoration ! how daring and suggestive ; and the
tiny dancing-shoes of the coryphee of death,
daintily placed in the corner of the panel !
* * * *
“In that terrible denunciation of evil,” says
Arthur Symons, “whiohhe called‘The Mysteri-
ous Hose-Garden ’ ” (well-known to Beardsley
collectors), ‘ the lantern-bearing angel with
winged sandals whispers, from among the faHiim
!i ldin ff s of more than ‘ pleasant sins. In
I he Wagnerians, ” in the Vast gloom of an opera-
house, the spectator sees before him the blushless
women with their white, full busts and gleaming
shoulders, their pouting, sensual mouths, de-
pressed noses, swimming eyes, and the bald heads
oi the nien contrasting with the luxuriant
coiffures of the females. In “Isolde” the artist
piles a wealth of decoration on a single section,
and throws half the drawing into blank white,
bounded by a single line which cuts off the solid
crimson of the rest of the picture. Always de-
corative, Beardsley attains often his greatest
effects by apparent defiance of all canons of de-
coration; but, consummate master that he is, his
finest work is that in which, by the employment
of a convention laboriously perfected, he seems to
set at naught the received conventions of his pre-
decessors and his contemporaries.-

SURPRISING CURES AFTER YEARS

Bayswater, Sydney, October, 1898.
W. H. Malyon, Esq., Man. Chemist, Ballarat.
Dear Sir, —For years past (about ten), I have been
troubled with “ Acne ” in its worst form, and have sought
advice from the best Australian and London doctors, with
only fail results. A Victorian friend of mine, some four
or five weeks ago, sent me a tin of your “Ligmolliene,”
and speaking very highly of its wonderful curative powers.
I naturally took same “ Cum Grano Salis,” and was in-
clined not to use it j eventually I tried your ointment
with truly marvellous results, and am now entirely cured ;
and think people who suffer from skin diseases are greatly
indebted to you for your wonderful remedy. I shall
advise all my friends with skin troubles to use same.
Wishing ‘ ‘ Ligomolliene ” all the success it richly deserves,
Yours faithfully', GEORGE J. O’REGAN.
WHAT THE DOCTORS SAY:—
Doveton-street, Ballarat,
My dear Mr. Malyon,— August 21 st, 1898.
With great pleasure I now sit down to record progress
with regard to my old enemy, “ Eczema Capitis,” from
which I suffered, notwithstanding constant treatment for
some years under the prescription of Professor M‘Call
Anderson and other eminent dermatologists, with only
partial and temporary relief. When I met you I com-
menced somewhat sceptically your ointment Ligmolliene,
and after about two months’ treatment I may honestly say
my enemy is defeated, and I am perfectly well. I will only
add that since I commenced the treatment of myself I have
prescribed it to others, and am still doing so with brilliant
results. Please accept my hearty thanks, and remain yours
sincerely, THOS. LE GAY HOLTHOUSE, M.R.C.S., L.

AN IN TTRUMENT OF TORTURE
is a truss made on the plan of the above, with a heavy
steel or iron band, as you know if you have been in the
habit of wearing one. Throw it away ! Why will you con-
tinue wearing such an instrument of torture, when we
can furnish you a most efficient truss — Elastic —without
an iron hoop or steel spring about it, and one that may
be worn with ease and comfort both NIGHT and DAY !
As for CURES, Dr. Pierce’s Celebrated Magnetic Elastic
Truss HAS ACCOMPLISHED THOUSANDS ! It is an
American Invention, made and sold for the past Twenty-
two years in America. It may now be had in Australia,
where it is performing most REMARKABLE CURES. It
is the only ELECTRIC TRUSS in the World ! If ruptured,
investigate at once. Call for free books, price list, &c. ;
or write for same, enclosing 2d. in stamps for postage.

TARE SHOULD BE EXERCISED in the SELECTION
and USE OF A FOOD FOR INFANTS ; this is a
matter of common experience, but the “ why and wherefore,”
are subjects of knowledge to the few only. In spite of the
general recognition of the immense importance of this
matter, it is one upon which a wide-spread and lamentable
ignorance prevails. There is, it is true, a growing feeling
with mothers that
FARINACEOUS FOODS
ARE BAD FOR INFANTS,

dearly bought experience, which is paid by the lives of
thousands of little ones.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The West Wind.
From out the city’s maelstrom
To thee withthankfulness I come,
For thou dost scatter in thy breeze
The treasure of a thousand seas.
Oh ! prodigal of happiness,
That all my heart can soothe and bless,
And lift me from the sullen round
Of days in one communion bound.
Thou hast the breath of spicy gales
From islands of unfurling sails,
And, scarce above the tide, the shores
Irradiate of madrepores.
There thou, perchance, hast blown athwart
Some mouldering fabric all amort,
Whose heart, dear God ! may even be
A sepulchre amid the sea !
Like some despairing man outworn,
Who carries in his breast forlorn
The ghosts of faiths no more enjoyed,
Love, hope, and conscience unalloyed.
Yet in thy strenuous harmony
Methinks I hear the threnody
Of surging continents that roll
In sable terror from the pole.
There thou thyself in pain dost go,
Through sleet, and lightning, hail and snow,
Impetuous for the azure main
Where thou canst rock to sleep again !
Pour on me all the magic thralls
Of old cathedrals, in whose walls
A thousand years of praise have given
Their sanctuary the peace of heaven.
And let thy whisperings disclose
The secret of the Norland rose,
Who waves her long, white life to sleep
Beneath some scarred, embattled keep.
Whose twilight elfin bugles blow
Unearthly music, that doth flow
To where the cataract is poured
Within the eremite fiord.
Where’er my early footsteps str i ved,
Thy wild companions, too, have played :
And here upon this Southern shore
Have sent with thee my youth once more.
And as I watch thy trailing cloud,
My heart beneath the verge is bowed,
To where the casement of the boy
Ope’d every morning unto joy.
I hear a sound, I feel a touch,
The ocean’s depth, it is not such,
The dawn of an intenser day
Beyond the sunset, far away !

Why I Am Poor.
Because, my friends, I have a savage glee
In drinking to the dregs the draughts of life;
And love to feel my spirit spreading free—
Stretching itself through every calm and strife,
Or stealing through the secret souls of others ;
Because, thank God, I’m made of simple stuff
And prize the friendship of my ragged brothers ;
Because I love my liberty enough
To starve for it at times ; because, forsooth,
I do not snub my manhood for a fee,
Or care a straw for anything but Truth
And the warm pulse of human sympathy ;
Because, in short, I’m reckless, rash and vain,
And feel the facts I speak out blunt and plain.

IT was in the summer of 1778, Wash-
ington, with his army ever active,
j determined to oppose the British
general, Sir Henry Clinton, who, having
evacuated Philadelphia, was retreating
through Hew Jersey on Hew York. The
forces met on 28th June at Monmouth.
La Fayette conducted the attack. The
heat was so intense that some refused to
fight, and many fell dead from exposure
to the sun’s rays. Both sides fought
desperately. As the day waned, and the
flagging spirits of La Fayette’s soldiers
were at a low ebb, a strange sight aroused
them. Marching with drum and life
was an old man, Jeremiah Wynton, and
his son, and grandson. The old father,
with silvery flowing locks, sturdily strode
through the field. The son with ban-
daged head fifing lustily, the youth,
catching the spirit of his grandsire, rolled
out with him the soul-inspiring rattle of
the drum. Father, son, and grandson
had accompanied the troops as volunteers,
and were ever in the forefront of the
fight. The fierce light of battle was in
their eyes, they knew no fear, and many
a wild cheer arose, as on that fateful
day Yankee Doodle was heard as never
was heard before or since.

The Federal Finance Lie.
There is pleasure in the wet, wet clay
When the potter’s hand is potting it;
There is pleasure in the wet, wet lay
When the poet’s pad is blotting it;
There is pleasure in the shine of your picture on the line
At tlie Royal Academy,
But every one of these is as chalk to Cheddar cheese
When compared with a well-built lie.
Kipling quoted from memory.
It isn’t even a well-built lie, but the quota-
tion may pass. In fact, the Federal finance
fiction, as circulated by the Sydney Tele-
graph and Truth, and the Sabbath Shell-
back, and George Pile’s dog, and the anti-
Federal party in general, was a ramshackle,
crippled and impossible-looking affair from
the beginning. Also, it was mangy and dis-
tempered, and had most of its hair scalded
off, and was a lost, yellow, down-on-its-
luck affair in every possible respect.
But in the country which is governed
mostly by One-Fool-One-Vote it has been
taken quite seriously, and all over New
South Wales perfectly sane-looking men
go round lamenting that if New South
Wales federates under the present Bill it
must pay far more taxation in proportion to
population than any other province. How
this mysterious result is to be arrived at no
one explains ; the only answer that can be
obtained is that the thing is so obvious that
it doesn’t need explanation. When the
obviousness is inquired after, the usual reply
is that any fool can see clearly how obvious
it is ; and if anyone asks for the address of
the particular fool who first saw it, it gener-
ally transpires that he has left the country.
But it is understood that Dr. M‘Laurin is
quite clear on the matter, and that John
Norton is prepared to use fearful blast and
blither language at anyone who fails to
recognise the situation at a glance.
* * *
To get an understanding of this eminently
bald and unconvincing lie it is necessary to
start at the beginning. The first point is
that, under Federation, the provinces will
all pay exactly the same customs and excise
duties. There is no possibility of charging
one province a penny more duty than an-
other upon anything ; and there is no clause
in the Draft Constitution which can be
strained into any semblance of such a possi-
bility. Therefore, the only way in which
New South Wales can pay more excise duty
in proportion to population than any other
province is by New South Wales manufac-
turing more exciseable goods—which are
mainly beer, spirits, and tobacco—than any
other province ; and it isn’t the leading pro-
ducer in any of these lines. Also, the only
way in which it can pay more customs duty
in proportion to population than any other
province is by using more imported goods.
At present, both South Australia and Wes-
tralia are larger importers per head of popula-
tion than New South Wales, and there is no
evidence that they won’t (or that they will)
continue so. If they do, then it is a case of
South Australia and Westralia being mulcted
for the benefit of New South Wales and other
provinces—and yet neither of them is squall-
ing in the ridiculous fashion affected by the
anti-Billites of Cornstalk Land.
* » » *
The Federal financial lie is mostly based
on a sum in simple proportion. N.S. Wales
has a low tariff, which is yielding this year
at the rate of about £1,400,000 per annum. If
Protection against the outside world is the
policy of the Commonwealth, and if the
customs-taxation is doubled, then New South
Wales will have to pay £2,800,000 a year,
and will be a grievously-burdened province.
In other words, if two men fall out of a
window a distance of 40yds., and are killed,
then six men, being three times the number,
will necessarily fall 120yds., out of three
windows, and be killed three times over.
And yet experience in quite recent
years has proved this argument to be
the most utterly foolish lie of the lot.
In 1889 New South Wales had a very low
revenue tariff, comprising duties on only 196
articles (the items can be found on pages
755-783 of the “ Year-Book of Australia ”
for 1890), most of them very small duties, and
levied on articles of small consumption. The
gross customs taxation amounted that year to
£1,905,883. In 1892 Dibbs had put heavy
duties on about 850 articles —he quadrupled
the tariff and more—and in its first year the
new tariff yielded, not £7,500,000 as it should
have done according to the anti-Federal lie,
but £2,677,890. And it did this for one
year only. Inside of 12 months New South
Wales was learning to produce for itself
many things it formerly imported, and in
1893 the tariff-burden was only £2,127,645.
In 1894 the province had further adapted
itself to its new conditions, and the tariff-tax
was only £2,065,839. And for the odd half
of 1895, when the date of the financial year
was altered, it yielded at the rate of only
£1,926,378 per annum. Actually, the heavy
Protective tariff on 850 articles only took
from the country, when it had settled
down to its new circumstances, at the
rate of £21,000 a year more than the
light Foreign-trade tariff on 196 articles,
and allowing tor the increase of popu-
lation it cost the country less per head
than the light Foreign-trade tariff did.
Then George Reid came into power and
knocked the great Dibbs tariff endways. He
reduced the list of dutiable articles to 52, and
most of these 52 duties were microscopic,
yet the customs revenue, instead of dropping
to about a quarter of what it was, is now
about £1,400,000 against the previous
£1,926,000.
* * * *
The moral of which is : If you double the
tariff you don’t double the customs revenue.
If you multiply the tariff by four you pro-
bably leave the customs revenue just about
where it was, for the simple reason that the
imports decrease and are largely replaced by
local production. If you multiply it by eight,
it is quite possible that you will reduce the
customs revenue and diminish the burden of
taxation, for there is a point where the people
would altogether cease importing and depend
wholly on local production. A very high
protective tariff would yield nothing at all ;
so would no tariff—the extremes meet
just about here. There is nothing
wildly abnormal about New South Wales’s
conditions to make a tariff in the Cornstalk
province widely different in its results from the
results it produces anywhere else. Experi-
ence has shown that when New South Wales
has settled down under a tariff something like
those of Victoria and South Australia it
produces just about the same revenue.
When a uniform Australian tariff has been
in operation for four or five years, and the
country has accustomed itself to its new
conditions, New South Wales will pay no
more customs taxation than its neighbors,
and even if it is a Protectionist tariff it will
pay not much more than it does now. These
conclusions are based on actual experience
in New South Wales within very recent
years ; not on the ravings of any Sunday
paper, nor on the alleged theories of the Pro-
vincial party’s alleged friend Thingumbob,
which alleged theories date from before
Dibbs’s experiment, so that the person, if
there was one, was only theorising in the
dark.
* • * •
The rest of the Federal finance lie is
based on the general assertion that New
South Wales is richer in proportion to popu-
lation than any other province, and has more
unexploited sources of revenue, and there-
fore the Commonwealth must' levy extra
taxation on New South Wales to make up
the deficiencies of the other provinces. Even
apart from the sufficiently obvious fact that
the Commonwealth can’t levy extra taxation
on New South Wales—that all Federal taxa-
tion must be uniform throughout the Federal
territory—this is just as ridiculous as the
other aberration. It has already been shown
that the Commonwealth can’t get more than
its fair share of taxation out of New South
Wales by the operations of a uniform Federal
tariff; New South Wales has tried a tariff
something like that of Victoria, with the
result that, after the first year’s shock, the
cash results promptly started to get down to
the Victorian level. If it makes other taxes
equal New South Wales will have to pay
postage on newspapers as some other pro-
vinces do, and its probate duties may
be raised to the Victorian level. And
New South Wales’ unexploited sources
of revenue, as things stand at present,
about end there. It has already used
up most of the possibilities of the land
and income tax, while Victoria, which
has hitherto taxed only estates which
exceed 640 acres area and £2500 value—all
pi’operties which don’t fill both condi-
tions go free—has a great part of its land-
tax possibilities to fall back upon. Also,
Queensland and Westralia have both land
and income taxes to fall back upon, never
having levied either as yet ; and Tasmania
can double its land-tax, which now stands at
only half the New South Wales figure, as its
little unexploited source of revenue ; and
Westralia has all the possibilities of probate
duties to fall back upon, there being no such
tax in that province up to date. Also Tas-
mania and Westralia have the M. newspaper-
postage to fall back upon, both having
free postage at present. When the Common-
wealth has adjusted these matters, and re-
duced the twopenny city postage of Victoria
and South Australia to id. as in New
South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania, and
Westralia, and reduced New South Wales’s
twopenny receipt-stamp tax to Id. as in
the other provinces, and levelled up the
bank-note tax of the other provinces to the
high rate charged in New South Wales, it
willbefound that New South Wales, Victoria,
Queensland, Westralia and Tasmania are
reasonably equal, in proportion to population,
inthewayof reserve power of taxation. Taking
them all round there is no reason to suppose
that with uniform customs, excise, postage
and stamp duties, and land and income
taxation, any one province will yield much
more per head than another, or that there
will be any great increase in the revenue of
any province.
* * * *
At all events, the wild cry about how the
“surplus” of New South Wales and the
“wealth” of New South Wales will be
grabbed by the other provinces is a grue-
some mockery. According to Coghlan’s
official statistics (“Wealth and Progress of
New South Wales” for 1897, page 856),
New South Wales has had two small sur-
pluses and nine deficits in the past eleven
years. It has an accumulated deficit, ac-
cording to its Auditor-General, of over
£3,000,000, which runs Victoria a dead
heat for the billet of the biggest
deficit in Australasia. Its revenue this
year shows a vastly smaller increase
than that of either Queensland or Vic-
toria, and a smaller increase in proportion
to population than that of South Australia.
As a revenue-producing country it is behind
South Australia, Queensland, and Westralia,
taking the respective populations into ac-
count, and, as already mentioned, Queens-
land has still the land and income tax, and
Westralia the land, income, and probate
taxes as unexploited sources of revenue,
while New South Wales has, to a
great extent, used up all three. Under
these conditions, there is absolutely no-
thing special or extraordinary in the con-
ditions of New South Wales, and with
uniform taxation there is no reason at all
to suppose that it will produce more re-
venue per head than its neighbors, that it
will produce much more revenue or be much
more burdened than it is now ; or that it will
have any notable surplus for its neighbors to
grab—even assuming that they want to grab it,
of which there is no evidence at all. The anti-
Federal party’s policy is to block Federation
by inflating the Cornstalk people into a
frenzy of silly vanity which will lead them
to make impossible demands of their
neighbors, and to look on them like the
Almighty keeping His eye on a blackbeetle,
and the bald assertion about the extraordi-
nary “ wealth ” and “ resources ” and “ sur-
plus ” of New South Wales is part of the
scheme. And the Federal finance lie grows
quite naturally out of these other lies.
Where the Mass Referendum Won’t
Work.
“ Referendum ” is a fine, sonorous word of
four syllables. It sounds well, in which respect
it stands on the same plane as “ Mesopotamia ”
and “elephantiasis,” and “ Merodach-Bala-
dan.” Also, it represents a great and invalu-
able democratic principle, in which respect it
stands a long way ahead of “Mesopotamia”
and “ elephantiasis,” and many other large ex-
pressions not forgetting “ Mahershalal-
hashbaz.” Still, there is little doubt that a
part of its popularity with those sections of the
community which have more jaw than brain
depends on the mouth-filling roar of its four
syllables, wherein it shares the advantages and
disadvantages of “ constitootional ” —another
expression of great tonnage that is grievously
misused. If the same noble idea was embodied
in a short, mean-sounding expression like
“Smith” —well, the idea would be just as
noble, and useful, and valuable, but probably
its popularity would be a good deal less. The
Bulletin is moved to these impressions by the
attitude of certain allegedly democratic anti-
Federalists who urge, as their objec-
tion to the present Federal scheme, that it
doesn’t provide for altering the Constitution
at any time by the vote of a bare majority of
the people of the Commonwealth, without any
regard to the opinions of the several States
which compose the Commonwealth. As they
put it : “ The essential Democratic principle of
the mass Referendum ought to be embedded in
the Constitution,” and, so far as concerns alter-
ations of the Constitution itself, it certainly
isn’t. The fact that the principle in question,
invaluable as it is, wouldn’t fit this particular
case any better than the invaluable boon of
political equality would fit a bad case of snake-
bite, makes no difference. Which is one of the
disadvantages attaching to a big, sonorous ex-
pression ; it sounds so well in an oration that it
is used out of season as well as in season. The
Bulletin, which has advocated the Referendum
for years, and believes in it now more strongly
than ever (where it fits the case), is almost
tempted to wish that that great idea had been
named “ Smith.” Then it might have had a
better chance to be used only where it was
wanted.
* * * •
The idea of permitting the Federal Constitu-
tion to be altered in any way, at any time, to
any extent, by a bare majority vote of the
people—by the mass Referendum, in fact-
pans out thus: Let it be assumed that a
Federation started with th ree partners—N.S. W.,
Queensland and S.A., or with a partnership of
Victoria, Tasmania, and W. A. The three
partners agree to a perpetual union on certain
terms, and the union is entered upon. But
the one large partner can, single-handed,
outvote the two small ones—can do it, in fact,
nearly twice over. Therefore, if the bargain
can be altered in any way by the mass Referen-
dum, it follows that the large partner can vary
the agreement as he pleases, and the other two,
after coming in on certain terms, must accept
any other terms the large partner pleases. The
fact that they are not going to sign such a
stupendous blank cheque as that is too dead cer-
tain to be worth arguing about. The fact that
they never will sign it while conditions remain as
they are is so obvious that the person who says
he is a Federationist, provided the Federal
Constitution can be altered by the mass
Referendum, might as well throw off his thin
disguise and admit that he is a Provincialist
all through.
* * * *
The conditions which make the mass Refer-
endum impossible as a means of altering the
Constitution are, in a small degree, provincial
jealousies, and, in a much larger degree, dis-
parity of population. The latter is 99 per cent,
of the trouble. If France and Austria, being
practically equal in population, formed a per-
petual treaty, it would be quite possible for
them to agree that its terms might be altered
or expanded or contracted to any extent by a
majority vote of the two nations. The fact
that one could muster about as large a vote as
the other would make the proposal reasonably
satisfactory to both parties. If France, with
38,000,000 people, entered into a perpetual
treaty with Belgium and Holland, mustering
about 11,000,000 between them, and proposed
that the bond might be altered, or added to, or
deducted from to any extent by a majority vote
of the three States, the proposal would be re-
jected with scorn. It would simply mean that
the one State which possessed the majority
could do anything it pleased with the other
two which didn’t, and they would pledge them-
selves in advance to agree to whatever the
other State asked. It would be signing an un-
limited series of blank cheques to be presented
through all the remainder of Time. Yet this
is exactly what the party which demands that
the Federal Constitution shall lie alterable by
a bare majority is asking. The fact that the
demand arises almost solely in the province
which has the largest vote makes it look all the
more sinister to the small-vote provinces.

If Australia was going in for unification in-
stead of Federation—which, unfortunately, it
isn’t doing as yet —the situat ion would be differ-
ent. There would then be no States to be
separately consulted—Australia would be all
one State. There would be no separate local
Parliaments to be consulted—only one Parlia-
ment. There would be no six parties to a
treaty —all Australia would be one party, and,
as one party can’t make a treaty with himself,
there would be no treaty. There wouldn’t he
six peoples interested, but one people, and on
all reasonable principle the majority must pre-
vail. But unification would also mean the
pooling of all assets—the N.S. W. Government,
for instance, couldn’t retain control of its
separate railway system and Crown lands, be-
cause there would then be no N.S. YV. Govern-
ment at all. And N.S. W., for one, refuses to
see the philosophy of letting Victoria, which
has very little public estate left, go
shares in its land-asset, or in pooling its
lines with the unpayable railways of Tas-
mania. So, instead of unification, Australia
proposes to adopt the next best thing—a per-
manent league of States—with the hope that
unification may follow later on. The only way
to make a league is by drawing up a common
basis of agreement. And those alleged Demo-
crats who live on large words instead of large
ideas want to insert a clause to this effect:
“ We, the large State of the bunch, make this
solemn and perpetual agreement with you,
the small States, but with the proviso that
after you have come in on these terms we
may alter the terms any way we please, and
you must stay in all the same.” In other
words, the 16-stone man suggests a business
partnership with the two 7-stone men, with the
proviso that the deed of partnership can be
altered to an unlimited extent by a majority,
the said majority to be decided by weight.
And the 16-stone gentleman would be the
majority all the time.
* * * *
So long as the provincial feeling lasts—and it
will take many years to eradicate it —no pro j
vince is likely to trust another with a blank
cheque of such dimensions. Considering the


hair-raising scare expressed in N.S.W., the
province with the largest voting power of the
crowd, at the alleged pretensions of the vastly
smaller and less populous State of Victoria, it
is safe to assume that if N.S. W. was itself a
small State it would be so much more scared
that it wouldn’t dream of any such surrender.
All that the three small States asked, when the
five provinces met in convention, was that the
consent of one of them must be obtained before
the two large States took away any of their
rights and burst up the solemn agreement on
which they were induced to enter the partner-
ship. And it wasn’t too much to ask ; no
large State with reasonably honest intentions
could well demand more otf a small and com-
paratively defenceless partner. If N.S.W.
and Victoria w’ere willing to cut themselves up
into five States instead of two, so that there
would be no two preponderating partners who
could sink all the rest, then the mass Referen-
dum might not be objectionable to anybody.
As it is, the small States naturally refuse to give
any big neighbors power to do absolutely what
they please with their assets, their territory and
their share of Parliamentary representation.
And they probably think that no big neighbor
whose intentions were quite honest would ask
for such power.
* * * *
The fact that the four small States are not
willing to have a Constitution which is altera-
able whenever the two large States feel that
way isn’t so very dreadful after all—when the
contents of that Constitution are considered.
Its main features are that both Federal Houses
shall be elected by, practically, One Man One
Vote, and that no State shall be deprived with-
out its consent of its State lands, its railways
or other assets, of any portion of its territory,
or of the share of Parliamentary representation
promised to it as a condition of its adhesion to
the Federal League. And the party which
advocates the mass Referendum as a means of
altering the Federal Constitution demands that
the large States shall have absolute power to
deprive the small ones of all these
things any time they feel that way.
If such a thing is advisable, then it is equally
advisable that the mass Referendum should
apply all round ; that, for instance, anybody
should be able to call for a Referendum as to
whether Holman, M.L.A., should be hanged,
not that he had done anything to deserve it,
but simply because the other fellow was tired
of Holman ; and if he got a majority of one
in any poll, no matter how small, that Hol-
man should be hanged at once and no questions
asked. If the Referendum can cover and
justify breach of faith (if a large community,
having offered certain terms of alliance to a
smaller one, can absolve itself from its obliga-
tion by its own vote), then it should be able to
justify murder also. But, in any case, the
utter impossibility of the arrangement, while the
existing disparities of population continue, is the
main point. Nobody goes into a partnership
without having some kind of a binding agree-
ment as to the main points at issue, and an
agreement which the other fellow can alter just
as much and as often as he pleases is no
agreement at all. The facts are so obvious
that the sham Democrats who say they are
enthusiastically in favor of Federation pro-
vided the Federal Constitution is alterable by
a bare majority vote might just as reasonably
declare that they want union above all things—
provided the people of the other provinces are
willing to be boiled before being united.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Secret-Conference “Telegraph.”
Probably the most regular curse of the Sydney
anti-Federal push just now is that the present
Federal scheme is a “Secret Conference Bill.”
The Sydney Telegraph, in particular, planks
down this monotonous jibe in every column,
until the unthinking multitude actually begins
to believe that there is something dreadful and
unusual about a Bill which isn’t drafted in a
public place. Yet the Federal Bill is the only
Government measure ever introduced into
N.S. W. Parliament which is not a Secret Con-
ference Bill. It was first prepared at an open
Convention. Then one or two alterations were
made in it at a Conference of Premiers, to
which the press and the public were not ad-
mitted. They probably would have been ad-
mitted if the anti-Federal organ had asked that
they should be—but it didn’t. It raised no
objections to a Secret Conference till it was too
late. The secresy does nobody any harm ; the
public knows what the proposed amendments
are, and Parliament knows them, and the
press knows them, and nobody could know
them one whit the better if all the de-
sultory conversation which led up to them
had been reported. But, at the worst, 99
per cent, of the Federal Bill was prepared in
public, whereas all the other Government
measures presented to the Parliament of
N.S.W. and the Parliament of every" other
place are prepared at a Secret Conference,
and always have been; and the disreputable
organ of disunion - at - any - price never ob-
jects. The press and the public are not
admitted to the Cabinet meetings where a
draft Bill is constructed, and they only see
the completed measure when it is presented to
Parliament. The fact that this drafting of all
N.S. W. Bills by a Secret Conference is a woe-
ful wrong and a grievous injury to the public
doesn’t seem to occur to the anti-Federal party
even now, though it declares that the drafting
of about one per cent, of the Federal Bill in
private (the other 99 percent, having been con-
structed in the full glare of publicity) is some-
thing too horrible for words. And, as a curi-
ous side-issue, the Telegraph’s own decision
to fight against Federation was arrived at in a
Secret Conference of directors, who meanly
shut out the public from their deliberations
on a matter of national importance. The
Secret Conference Telegraph claims that
if the Premiers’ meeting had been held in
public the community would have got at a
knowledge of the sordid motives which led up
to it ; so it is equally fa r to assume that the
sordid motives of l lie Telegraph, and the
reasons why it decided to deceive and misguide
the public, would have been laid bare if it
hadn’t arrived at its decision in the stealthy
seclusion of the directors’room. I hat Secret
Conference of the Telegraph directorate wasn t
a mere private business matter. It was a
meeting at which it was resolved, for unknown
reasons, that all the weight of an influential
paper should be cast against the cause of Aus-
tralian nationhood, but by reason of the under-
hand. murkiness and unmanly stealth of that
veiled gathering the public doesn’t know the
directorate’s motive, therefore it doesn’t know
whether to believe the paper or not. And
whereas the Federal Bill was mostly constructed
in open day, the other thing was all done in
gloom and seclusion. The Secret Conference
Telegraph set the example and now it curses
those who follow it.
The Penny-Postage Lie.
One small and rather gaunt lion which the
Sydney provincial party is endeavoring to put
in the road of union is an animal decorated
with a penny stamp and five twopenny ones.
N.S. W. lias penny postage inside all the prin-
cipal towns and their suburbs. So also have
Queensland, YVestralia, and Tasmania. Two
provinces only (Victoria and South Australia)
out of the six have a minimum postal rate of
twopence. Sydney Daily Telegraph recently
started a lamentable yarn on this subject by
publishing pictures of six postage-stamps —a
Id. one of N.S.W., and a 2d. one of each of
the other provinces. This inferential lie was
evidently intended to create an impression that
there was no penny postage in these other pro-
vinces. Then there came the bald statement:
Under the Bill our Id. postage system would have to go.
Only that. Not a word of reason or evidence,
but only the unsupported assertion of the
painfully honest and fair-minded gentleman
of the Telegraph. And it is a very ridicu-
lous lie, for, even supposing Victoria and
S.A. want to retain the 2d. town postage,
the idea that N.S. Wales, Queensland, Wes-
tralia and Tasmania (66 votes in the Federal
Parliament) would give way to Victoria and
S.A. (41 votes) is too childish to be worth
consideration. There must be uniform p >stal
rates under Federation, but the statement that
the four provinces must necessarily give way
to two in the matter is a much less plausible
lie than the King-street organ generally
constructs, and suggests that the office Ana-
nias is getting worn out through overtime.
Another feature of the case is this : Any Federal
scheme must provide for the amalgamation of
the various postal systems. Any scheme must
include uniform postage. Therefore the Tele-
graph is stating its objection, not to this Bill,
but to Federation in general, and once more it
clumsily reveals itself as an organ of Provincial-
ism which is trying to catch votes by professing
Federalism, and which objects to the present
scheme, not because there is really anything
wrong with it, but because it is against all
Federal schemes, however perfect. And in all
its lament there is not one word about its real
grievance, which is this. N.S.W. carries
newspapers free of postage, but charges on
papers from the adjacent provinces. The west
and south, being nearer to Adelaide and Mel-
bourne than to Sydney, would naturally
patronise the Adelaide and Melbourne papers
to a great extent —only they cost posted,
where the Telegraph, being “ coddled,” and
“ subsidised,” and “ protected,” at the expense
of the taxpayer, costs only Id. In other
words, the Freetrade paper enjoys, not only
free-carriage-within-the-province, but also 50
per cent, of Protection against outside papers.
When Federation brings uniform postal rates
there are two visible alternatives—either all
papers will be charged |d. postage or all will
go free, but either way the 50 per cent. Pro-
tection enjoyed by the paper which howls for
Freetrade must go. It isn’t at all certain
that the Federal Government will insti-
tute all-round newspaper postage; N.S.W.,
Tasmania, and Westralia all carry local
papers free within their own territory subject
to the same regulations, so there will be about
53 votes from the free-newspaper-postage pro-
vinces against 54 from the provinces which
charge postage. But the Telegraph doesn’t
want even free newspaper postage all round,
and freetrade in its own wares, and free com-
petition. What it is yearning for is a con-
tinuance of the present 50 per shent. Protec-
tion. It is that and not the preservation of the
Id. town letter-postage that it is worrying
about. The latter, with one large and three
small provinces in its favor, and only one
large and one small province against it, is safe
enough. It is doubly safe, as the Premier of
the one large 2d.-stamp province (Victoria) has
declared that he fully anticipates and reckons
on the Id. system under Federation, and
George Turner, being practically the whole
Vic. Government, counts for something in such
a matter. Therefore, the Telegraph’s penny-
postage mendacity is a remarkably weak men-
dacity and obviously wants to take somebody’s
pink pills for pale liars.
The Public Brute.
It would be hard to imagine ranker balderdash
than the assertion voiced by a correspondent of
Sydney Daily Telegraph, with reference to
certain recent public meetings, that the police
have been “illegally directed to remove citizens
from public buildings,” and that “ those so
ejected could recover damages therefor*” The
citizen who makes a nuisance or a rowdy of
himself is in no way protected from proper
police interference because he happens to
do so in a public building or at a pub-
lic meeting; and the trouble in such a
case as the recent organised attempt to
over-hoodlum Reid and Barton was, not
too much policeman, but too little. No man is
compelled to attend a public meeting, and
though by custom a reasonable amount of
interjection or rationally-expressed dissent has
come to be tolerated, it shouldn’t on that
account be forgotten that it is merely tolerated,
and that, strictly speaking, any person in-
tentionally interrupting a public speaker, within
a building set apart for the occasion, is legally as
liable to expulsion as if he had taken to boo-hoo-
ing a parson in mid sermon. The premeditated
disturbaneeof public meetings—like the pleasing
custom of pelting a Parliamentary candidate
with rotten eggs—is a mere barbarous survival
which, being hopelessly out of touch with modern
ideas, requires repression upon strictly modern
methods. Nothing of the sort is tolerated in
the United States, where interrupters or dis-
turbers are promptly “ fired ” ; and, in order to
get the right light upon the practice here, it is
only necessary to imagine a proposal formally
to legalise it ; to enact, for instance, that
the hitting of a man in the face with
a stinking egg—a brutal and vicious assault
m ordinary circumstances—shall, if the man
happens to be a parliamentary candidate, be no
assault at all. lhat would be the extreme
case, but such carefully-prepared ruffianism as
that of the recent Centennial Hall meeting
stands exactly on the same footing, and should,
if five policemen can’t deal with it, receive the
attentions of 50, or of 500 if necessarv ! The
Collective Brute has no rights beyond the indi-
vidual one.

More Shellback Arithmetic.
The Sydney Sunday Shellback’s arithmetic
again :
The Any-Price party are wont to ridicule figures
(which, however, they cannot controvert), showing what
an enormous disproportionate burden New South Wales
will have to bear under the Bill.
Confirmation has come from a Victorian source. In
1891 Mr. F. H. Bruford, in the Victorian Premier’s de-
partment, prepared a confidential report to the Govern-
ment, and the Sunday Times has been furnished with a
copy.
Mr. Bruford takes the importations for 1889 for all the
colonies, and, basing his calculations on the Victorian
tariff, supposing it to be in force under the Common-
wealth, makes the following startling announcement
Victoria: Population, 1,140,405; net revenue, £2,610,719.
New South Wales : Population, 1,134,207 : net revenue
paid, £3,393,906.
So that, with less population at that time, New South
Wales would have to pay £783,187 more than Victoria.
Now that the population is greater, her contribution
would be still larger.
Mr. Bruford’s figures are corroborated by the late
Mr. H. H. Hayter, Government Statistician, who said:—
“I have caused the figures to be checked, and the dis-
crepancies are not sufficiently important to affect the
general result.”
The Bulletin begs to controvert these state-
ments right away. Bruford, it will be observed,
“takes the importations for 1889,” and builds
his estimates thereon. N.S.W., because it had
a low tariff, imported a great deal. Victoria,
because it had a higher tariff, imported much
less. And if N.S. W., with a high tariff, went
on importing just the same as if it had a low
one, the result would be as above. But then it
would do nothing of the kind. Dibbs put the
matter to the test, with the result that the
Customs taxation per inhabitant of the two
provinces was as follows :
1890 1892 1894 1895
Low Tariff High Tariff High Tariff High Tariff
N.S.W. £1 13 7 £2 3 7 £1 12 6 £1 11 3
High Tariff High Tariff High Tariff High Tariff
Vic. £2 6 3 £1 16 10 £1 10 3 £1 10 2
These figures (from Coghlan’s “Seven Colonies”
for 1897-8, page 165, and same work for 1895-6,
page 153) embody the whole case. Vic. with a
high tariff pays less and less customs taxation as
the people learn to depend more on local pro-
ducts and less on imports. N.S.W., in the
first year of its high tariff, before the people
had begun to learn how to depend greatly on
local products, showed a great increase of taxa-
tion. But in just two years taxation had gob
down almost to the Victorian level, and in
another year, if the Bibbs tariff had lasted, it
would probably have actually arrived there.
Of course, as Bruford says, the N.S.W. people
would have paid a lot more if they had gone
on importing as much under the high tariff
as they did under the low one—but they
didn’t. No country ever does. And that
is why the story about the undue share
of customs tax which N.S.W. will pay
under a uniform tariff is a stupid lie from the
first letter to the last. Also, the result doesn’t
show that “ the purchasing power of the people
will be diminished.” It only shows that they
will buy more in the local market and less
abroad.
The Advocates of Repudiation.
Under the Braddon Clause (No. 87 of the
Federal Constitution) it is provided that three-
fourths of the customs and excise revenue of
each province is to be handed back to it to
pay the interest on its public debt, or applied
by the Commonwealth to pay interest on the
public debt. Either way it is to be set aside to
pay interest on the public debt, and the Federal
Government is to live on the other fourth of the
customs and excise and on its absolutely un-
limited powers of direct taxation. The clause
was inserted because every state depends on its
customs and excise revenue to pay interest
with, and when the Federal Government
gets the revenue and leaves the States to
pay the interest the latter must have
part of that revenue handed back—or else they
must stop payment. At present Victoria and
Tasmania require five-sixths of their customs
and excise revenue to pay interest on their
debts ; Queensland requires practically the
whole of it; while in S.A. and N.S.W. the
entire customs and excise don’t nearly cover
the annual interest bill —don’t come within
long cannon-shot of it, in fact. The figures are :
Customs and Interest on
Excise. Debt.
N.S. Wales £1,529,830 ... £2,298,974
S. Australia 607,226 ... 953,119
Queensland 1,323,094 ... 1,274,244
Tasmania 371,215 ... 318,731
Victoria 2,110,866 .. 1,842,976
Taking Australia all round, the whole customs
and excise revenue and something more is re-
quired to pay interest. So presumably
M‘Laurin and Pilcher and Dibbs and John
Haynes, and the rest of the anti-Blotters
who object so savagely to three-fourths (only
three-fourths) of it being set apart for that pur-
pose, propose to stop payment of the interest
and repudiate the public debt altogether. The
crowd which is so bitterly angry at provision
being made for the honest payment of the coun-
try’s interest obligations must surely, in its
secret soul, propose not paying them. There
is something weird about the Repudiation party’s
denunciation of the utter sinfulness and
ruinousness of arranging for meeting our debts
regularly, and the yell of the party of National
Default is loud and awful in the land. Also it
is especially awful in the columns of the Tele-
graph. For instance, one “J.D.,” who is a
fair and reasonable specimen of the tribe, is
allowed to hold forth there iu the interests of
Repudiation as follows :
Now, sir, if this clause provides that 15s. in the £ of
Customs revenue shall be returned to each State (and not
even the most ardent anyprioer can deny the fact) this
provision means that the Federal tariff must of necessity
be four tunes higher than would otherwise suffice for
the needs of the Federal Government.
~ T ° tel ,' the P eo P ,e > the » ( as the prominent Billites do}
that a clause in the Bill which makes it imperative that
the federal tariff must be so constructed is an “excres-
cence is, I submit, to insult the intelligence of every
elector who has wasted his time in listening to or reading
such obvious claptrap. *
The above is the usual argument—only it is
left unfinished. The clause certainly “provides
that 15s. in the ,£ of customs revenue shall he
returned to each State ” (to pay interest with)
till the Commonwealth takes over the debts.
Therefore, “ the Federal tariff must be four
times higher than would otherwise suffice ” (if
no provision was made for paying the interest
on the public debt). And in like manner
the tariffs of N.S. W. and S.A. are now
thousands of times higher i.i.ui would otherwise
suffice (if they didn’t make provision for pay-
ing any interest on their debts), so the existing
situation is a lot more terrible than the pro-
spective one, without anybody noticing it. In
fact the N.S.W. tariff may safely be said to be
1,529,830 times “higher than would otherwise
suffice ” (if it didn’t make provision for paying
interest). The Repudiationists, or Party of
Default, or the Public Robbers Party—there is
a great choice of names—has MacLaurin, and
Dibbs, and Heydon, and Pilcher, and the
Telegraph for its prophets, and these prophets
preach the easy doctrine of how much money
might be saved by not paying the country’s
just debts—the beautiful, plausible, fascinating
doctrine of Nothing in the £.

N.S.W. Cabinet commuted three death-sen-
tences on one day last week. On the face of it,
this shows that the law provides death-penal-
ties wffth undue liberality or that the Cabinet,
under oath to obey the law, is too humani-
tarian or pusillanimous to act up to its behests.
In either case reform should be immediate.
The condemned men were tried in different
parts of the country and by different Judges.
If they were implicated in one offence and vic-
tims of one trial the Cabinet whitewash-brush
would not carry so large a meaning. As it is,
there were three separate extravagances of
legal procedure, culminating in three solemn
sentences of death—the extravagances of law
and the judicial last rites being later on set
aside by a few officials sitting in camera and
giving no reasons to the public justifying the
abandonment of the holocaust. No social con-
dition between the cradle and the grave can be
less satisfactory to a people who claim to make
and administer through responsible agents
their own laws. Persons charged with high
crimes are encouraged by such results to con-
sider their fate in the hands of Luck—not of a
Law every step of which should be intelligible
to all.

Premier Kingston has come back irom the
general election in S.A. with his big majority
unimpaired. By 16th June he will have com-
pleted his sixth consecutive year in the Pre-
miership, and on present appearances he should
be good for another whole term, which will
make nine years. Even jaunty Johnny Bray,
who was a sticker where the loaves and the
whales were concerned, though unstable in all
else, never hung on'longer than three years.
And, in addition to his personal triumph,
Kingston has the satisfaction of knowing
that his appeal to the people for a straight-out
vote for or against Council reform has been
answered by a huge majority in the affirmative,
and that the Federal referendum has produced
a far larger vote than last one, and about twice
the majority in favor of Federation that S.A.
showed in June, ’9B. As for the much-bragged-
of “Conservative reaction” it proved as dead
as the wrecked belltopper that was thrown
into the dust - hole last year. Even the
row over the Holy Roman demand for
a grant to denominational schools, which was
expected to be a great factor in the election,
didn’t shake Kingston in the least. Few
Premiers have scored three such victories
in one day, and Kingston’s success is
the more remarkable for being achieved in
South Australia, where, until his time, there
never had been a decently stable Ministry.
Crow-eater Land had four Ministries in 1857,
two in 1860, four in ’6l, three in ’63, four in
’65, four in ’6B, three in ’72, three in ’Bl—in
fact, the bygone Crow-eater used to throw out
two or three Governments simultaneously to
save time.

While Kohen (with a K) and Co. (with a C)
are denouncing the proposed Federal Constitu-
tion, on the ground that it is undemocratic, and
that it places N.S.W. at the feet of the smaller
States; here is old John Warren, M.L.C.,
an S.A. Tory leader, issuing his anti-Bill mani-
festo, on the eve of the referendum in his pro-
vince. Some sections of it herewith, for the
special enlightenment of Kohen and co.—and
the dog :
Reasons why electors should vote “ NO ’’
2. Because if the Bill is accepted, it will be impossible
to amend it in the interest of the smaller States, as the
larger will have an overwhelming’ majority in Parliament.
3. Because property is not represented in the Federal
Parliament, but is placed at the feet of Democracy and
Labor, to crush, oppress, tax, and rob at their sweet un-
checked will.
4. Because it is . . . giving the control of the Federa-
tion to the centres of population in N.S.W. and Vic-
toria. . . .
6. Because ... if S.A. and Tasmania join they will
be without even a shadow of power in the Federal Parlia-
ment, and will be in the hands of Democrats and Labor
leaders to deal with as they please.
7. Because the spirit of unity has got such a hold on
Australians, it will produce a better form of union.
There you have the Tory hope stated with the
old squatter’s brutal frankness. “A better
form of union ” will be one in which (1) the
few can secure an amendment of the basis ; (2)
property will be represented ; (3) the majority
will not rule ; (4) democrats and labor leaders
will be unknown ; and, if only this perniciously
democratic Bill can now be defeated, “ the
spirit of unity ” which “ has got such a hold on
Australians ” will, he believes, lead them in
desperation to presently take anything. It is
the most pressing invitation to the democracy
to cut its throat and be cheerful about it that
this paper knows.

Anthony Hope’s “ Adventure of Lady
Ursula,” if that lady meets with her deserts, will
be one of the successes of the Brough season at
Sydney Royal. It is not a wildly farcical comedy,
but there is a pleasant freshness in the plot, and a
quaint, interesting, old-world flavor about the
dialogue, and a restfulness about the knee-breeches
and laced coats of a hundred years ago; and these
things, combined with the merits of the co., should
make it go. Nothing in it is calculated to bring a
blush to the cheek of any boarding-school; even
the complimentary allusions to the lady’s legs are
so obviously made under the impression that she
is a very young man that it is impossible to take
offence. Lady Ursula’s troubles begin over her
attempt, made in pure girlish cussedness, to pene-
trate into the house of a notorious woman-hater and
repentant duellist, by fainting, along with a friend,
on the doorstep of his mansion. He refuses to take
her in despite her faint, and her brother, who
happens along just then, uses language to the
inhospitable one that can only be wiped out by
slaughter. And then the distracted girl, being
unable to penetrate in her skirts to the dwelling of
the enemy, because he invariably refuses to see
anyone with skirts, calls on him in male attire to
try to bring about an accommodation. She brings
it about so well that she is offered a bed in the
bachelor homestead for the night, also liquor, a
pipe, a pinch of snuff, a large, friendly smack on
her tender shoulders, an evening’s “bust” in
London, an introduction to sundry unmarried
males, and many other things that a distracted
girl doesn’t know what to do with. And
her excited refusals of the bed and the pipe and
the drink cause a new friendship to freeze until it
nearly freezes into tragedy. Net Lady Ursula
gets away with her character in perfect repair, and
without taking any more drink than a perfectly
well-conducted maid should ; and she struggles
through all these trying situations without leaving
any fragments of her good name behind her.
* * * *
Mrs. Brough manages to be a more con-
vincing boy than when the play was first produced
in Melbourne. Then it was difficult to imagine
how all the drinky bachelors were deceived as to
her sex, but now she wears the blue coat and the
other fixings quite well enough to pass muster.
The other members of the co. seem to fit into their
places vastly better than when they wrestled with
the unpaid wash-bill of Bonaparte. Joseph Carne is
suggestive of Titheradge in his best days. There
are many difficult spots in his part, notably where
the awkwardness of the situation dawns on him,
and he has to crawl backwards out of his duel
without shooting the lady, or offering her any
more drink or tobacco, or wrecking his own repu-
tation ; and the more difficult the spot the more
successful he is as a rule. Brough’s clergyman is
a distinct success, and Mario Majeroni towers im-
pressively in his gaudy uniform. Miss Bessie
Thompson, who fills Miss Romer’s former part as
old woman, looks a trifle too young for the billet,
but otherwise there is no objection to be taken;
and Miss Temple is only a trifle hard and mono-
tonous. “ Lady Ursula ” doesn’t pretend to
much in the way of plot. It is only a passing
episode, but the episode goes exceedingly well,
and anybody who happens to be in bed when it
passes will be a serious loser thereby.

The “ Belle of New York ” reached Sydney
on Saturday night, and every seat in Her
Majesty’s was occupied. Also, there was a surplus
of standing population, though not so much as in
the days when the cordial multitude stood three
deep to see “lolanthe” or “Mikado.” The
“Belle” is a show of reasonable length, but it was
expanded a good 25 minutes on the first night by
many encores, only about one-third of which were
fairly genuine. Oscar Girard and Louise Hepner
only came back when they were really in demand,
but some of the smaller lights returned at the
smallest smattering of perfunctory applause—in
fact, one solitary applaw was sufficient to make
some of them reappear and do the thing over again.
The average musical comedy is as disjointed as the
old-time criminal who used to be torn to pieces by
four horses, and is a great deal of variety business
about nothing in particular ; the “ Belle ” is even
more disjointed than the average and it is about
nothing with 45 per cent, discount taken off. It
is a gorgeously-mounted variety show crying in a
wilderness of costly props. There is no sense in it,
no plot, no moral, no continuity, nothing that is
calculated to benefit the young man whose soul
doesn’t feel well, not much startling music, and it
lives in an atmosphere of divorce, and short skirts,
and wine, and old cigar-ash, and old men who run
on senile legs after pretty girls. The present
writer (a person absolutely devoid of morals) grew
weary towards the end. Even a surfeited Solomon
or Yitellius might sit up on his golden throne
with some show of interest when the first pair of
feminine stockings he had seen that day went by.
But when the 114th consecutive pair of brief skirts
and stockinged limbs goes by he feels blank and
vacant, and would as soon that they were bed-
posts. That’s what’s the matter with the alleged
“ musical comedy ”in general. It is so much the
same, and the 114th pair of legs is a weariness and
a monotony and an anguish in the flesh.
* * * *
The other side of the case is that a good
deal of the music isn’t quite awful, the dialogue
is bright in places, the stage surroundings, as
already mentioned, are magnificent; some of the
dances are cheerful exercise on a very gratifying
toe, and the two principals are satisfactory.
Oscar Girard is a streak of gaunt, long-legged
humor which lights up the whole show, and
Miss Louise Hepner’s Salvation lassie is a quaint
and pleasant personage with a voice that is
refreshing to listen to. Moreover, the character
is a refreshing one; it is something quite apart
from the atmosphere of wine and cigar-ash, and
the 114 pairs of iegs which are calculated to make
Solomon feel so very much satiated in Jerusalem.
Ihe rest of the ladies are - good-looking in the
mam, and wear lovely clothes, and some of them
SIU ? T • and 801110 don,t > but almost all of them
rush their parts with a mercurial eagerness which
keeps the show going all the time. If a show of
that land stopped to think, the results would be
fatal, but the “Belle ” is wise in its leggy day and
short-skirted generation, and it doesn’t stop.
Half its secret lies in the vim with which
the co. shoves things through, and most of
the other half lies in Williamson’s lavish manage-
The writer had thoughts of suggesting that
i -n -Jf erman idiot with the knife, who wants to
kill Bronson, should be struck out, but he with-
draws the proposition. If the German was a slow
idiot he ought to be withdrawn, but being a fast
idiot in a piece which lives on its velocity he had
better be retained. The Bulletin’s verdict is
that everybody who can possibly get there should
go to see the “ Belle of New York.” It is admir-
ably suited to please persons of a low order of
intelligence, and most people are built like that.
Ihe present writer, having so much intelligence
that he‘Would burst if he had anymore, is weary
of the “ Belle ” to the last extreme of weariness,
and when the 114th pair of purposeless hose rushes
to the front, he wishes the owner thereof were
dead with a great deadness. Man cannot live on
hose alone.
* * *
“The Merry Wives of Windsor,” at Syd-
Criterion, proved to be less enduring than
Othello,” and already the last nights of that
pageant are announced. It deserved a longer run,
but though business hasn’t altogether perished—
not by a long way—Rignold probably recognises
that it is unwise to run the immortal Bard into
the ground. Therefore, a new version of the
“ I hree Musketeers ” is in preparation. The
Bulletin is trying to have great hopes of the
Musketeers,” and is succeeding none too well.
For that great rich romance is so full of life and
blood and thrill and incident that it would need
to be presented in 108 acts spreading over a month
to do it justice. And when the largest compressed
fragment of it that can be possibly given in one
night is put on the stage, people are bound to go
away saying it isn’t nearly so good as the “ Three
Musketeers ” which they read when they were
young.
** * *
That lurid tale of what comes to him who
gazes upon the beer when it is threepence, and
looks into the pint-pot when it is long, thrives
considerably at Sydney Lyceum. “Man’s
Enemy ” is a vigorous drama without much
artistic finish, but for the sake of its vigor it
should be subsidised by all teetotal organisations.
The hero of it—lnman—has a hereditary craving
for the bottled enemy; his aristocratic father has
successfully resisted it, but his ancestors have had
a tendency to come home in the small hours, and
put the dog to bed by mistake, and kick them-
selves out, for many generations. He comes of an
ancient family whose track of empty bottles
stretches back to the Conquest or further, and the
founder of the family had frequently fallen over-
board through drink while helping to invade
England in 1066. Inman marries a flashy adven-
turess, and her accomplice, who wanted to marry
her himself, sets himself to develop the hero’s
thirst, and pursues him with a bottle and a cork-
screw all over Europe. He succeeds so well that the
hero is tight in almost every part of that continent.
His father casts him off in a crumpled heap of
beer. His wife, who really meant to love him and
to keep square, loathes him for hiccupping in her
ear and turns adventuress once more. The drinking
one loses his last copper, and kills somebody, and
becomes a casual laborer with a wrecked con-
stitution and only one cotton shirt in the world,
and he screams wolfishly for gin outside the cheap
pubs of eastern London.
* ♦ • *
Then his wife finds a pretty girl trying to
reform him, and as she doesn’t want him reformed
(what she craves after is his sudden death and the
insurance money) she hires a ruffian to throw
vitriol over the pretty girl. But the ruffian gets
drunk himself and throws the liquor over his
employer instead, therefore the good girl of the
tale is saved by Drink from a fate that is too
awful for words. This scribe here stops to give
three cheers for Drink. And the horribly "dis-
figured adventuress, who has been quite sober all
the time, now becomes an object of loathing to her
perfectly sober accomplice, who pounds her
to death with the poker. The rest of the
details are not filled in, but it is understood that
the perfectly sober murderer is hanged by a sober
executioner—so after all the moral isn’t nearly so
clear as it might be. And the vigorous play is
somewhat disfigured by a ghastly improbability in
the shape of a ruined Jew who tries to eke out a
living hawking boot-laces. This paper never saw
a ruined Jew, and never expects to, though a
heart-breaking procession of ruined Gentiles drifts
to and fro all day long before its office windows
like a scum of old clothes and decayed hats going
up and down upon a tide that never rests.
#* * *
Up to the hou.r when these few remarks
were penned Sydney’s precarious Opera House
was still keeping open, and the “Two Scamps”
had not utterly perished off the face of the earth.
The Scamps are supposed to be a musical comedy,
which brings them into unfortunate conflict with
the “Belle of New York.” For the public has
come to regard musical comedy as a luxury—a
thing to be enjoyed in a big, gorgeous theatre,
with fine clothes, fine scenery, innumerable legs,
an atmosphere of boiled shirt and abundant music,
a perfume of the best society’s back hair and a
pleasing view of the best society’s white shoulders
and vertebral knots —and it is at a grievous disad-
vantage in the rather ancient ark away down
King-street. Still, by dint of cheap prices, the
“Scamps ” have so far kept afloat.

Peggy Pryde and the other people men-
tioned in the advt. are doing great things at Syd-
ney Tivoli. Just now the competition in theatri-
cal matters is tremendous, but Rickards’ songsters
and dancers and cheerful contortionist and all the
rest fill the Tiv. regularly just the same. ’Arry
R. appears impervious to competition.
** * *
Notwithstanding the success of the new
programme, and the fact that the vast tent is
crowded to its uttermost stretch of calico every
night, the stay of Fitzgeralds’ Circus in Sydney is
fast drawing to a close. After the present season
it is understood that the lion and elephant act and
the tiger and horse performance will be discon-
tinued, on account of the wear and tear of the
animals. So, whoever desires to see these startling
feats is reminded that his one golden opportunity
is rapidly passing away.
** * *
Melbourne’s idolatry of Amy Castles is
easily explained by the fact that the public never
heard the damsel sing until she had been talked
and paragraphed into notoriety. Thousands
rushed to her first concert eager to applaud. They
brought their enthusiasm with them ready-made.
But how about the new Bendigo worshippers?
They paid record prices to hear Amy Castles sing
last week, and although she was so hoarse that
“she was not permitted to give any encore
numbers,” they “recalled her repeatedly” and
passed up “lovely floral tributes,” and gave them-
selves all the excitement they wanted for their
money. In connection with which furore we
have the following humorous announcement: —
“The net proceeds of the entertainment will be
about £250, and to further assist the fund it is
intended to produce the opera ‘ Patience, ’ with
Miss Castles in the leading part, which she filled
on the occasion of the production of the opera by
the Bendigo Operatic Society some months ago.”
The difference between now and some months
ago ! Then she wasn’t hoarse, but the Bendigo-
mans found nothing marvellous in Amy’s voice.
The world sees what it is told to see, and hears
what it is told to hear.

Bishop Thornton, of Ballarat, hits the
mark occasionally. “This,” he says, “is the era
of the benevolent-fund dinner, of the self-denial-
fund ball or ‘art-union,’ of the ‘charity carnival.’
The growing reliance on ‘ dodges ’ of this nature
for the nieans of fulfilling a public duty is empty-
ing beneficence of most of its charm and elevating-
power. I know of no truer ‘cant’than appeals
to people to entertain themselves in the sacred
cause of charity, unless it be calling a lottery-
f amble an ‘art-union.’” But the new cant that
)r. Thornton rails at is a natural outcome of old
religious hypocrisy. Two performances are given
at different times in the same theatre by the same,
or nearly the same, artists. The one, being in aid
of needy actors, is called a “benefit”; the other
is promoted by goody-goody folk on behalf of a
hospital, or any charity in which the church takes
a commanding interest, and it professes to be
something more holy and righteous than a mere
benefit.
* * *
Cinquevalli, the unrivalled artist who
kicks two-and-sixpence into his eye, is drawing all
Melbourne to the Bijou, and his six months’ en-
gagement promises a joyful time for Rickards.
Further inspection of Cinquevalli’s performance
has persuaded the present writer that it is better
to be Rickards than the other fellow in the trans-
action. Every time the 401 b. cannon-ball falls
with a deadly kerplunk between the juggler’s
shoulder-blades one is sorry to know that he is not
in robust health. The constant dropping of the
cannon-ball upon his spine doesn’t account for his
genial smile, which is chiefly due to steady prac-
tice and a large salary. Whilst the lump of iron
is smiting his neck or shaving the top of his
ear, Cinquevalli thinks of his celebrity and his
cash compensation, and looks glad without any
visible effort; whereas it is the business of his
assistant to appear as a gloomy, anxious comedian.
Cinquevalli’s man-in-buttons is a capital foil to
the dapper artist, and their little bits of silent
humor seem as new and original as the rest of the
work. Everything takes its proper place in this
remarkable show. When there is nothing else left
for the serio-comic attendant to do, he fixes him-
self on a chair like a stuffed Guy Fawkes, and
Cinquevalli walks off, balancing the chair on his
jaw between his teeth.
** * *
Dante, at St. George’s Hall, seems to
prosper all the more since the juggler burst upon
the city. There’s a boom in feats of skill, and a
strong demand for dexterity and strange surprises,
consequently the supper that emanates from
emptiness, and the lady who perishes in a glare of
red fire and gets born again in a different costume,
likewise the ace of spades that travels on its own,
and the immortal spirit of the Red Indian behind
the curtain, are popping up every evening until
further notice.

At Melbourne Princess, the farewell fort-
night of Marcus Julius and Miss Ferrar was com-
menced on Saturday with a rather rough-edged
performance of “Pygmalion and Galatea.” For
the last three nights of this week “The Harbor
Lights ” will fill the bill and diffuse an odour of
brine from Gordon’s beautiful painted ocean.
Then “A Royal Divorce,” and “Sign of the
Cross,” in which unwholesome melodrama our old
friend Marcus will disclose his legs for the last
time on Thursday next. Julius Knight and Ada
Ferrar are not quite such imposing artists as they
appear in the Firm’s advt., but they are always
earnest and satisfactory ; also they are backed up
by a “ double ” company, so, taking everything in
consideration, the present rush of revivals should
make business lively at the Princess until next
Bulletin looms above the horizon.
** * *
' Bland Holt has arranged to end the gaudy-
moral lesson of “Woman and Wine” in its
seventh week, which will be next week, therefore
persons desirous of witnessing the evil wrought
by Liquor and Lydy, at Melbourne Royal, must
begin to hurry up, otherwise they may chance to
be, too late. Miss Watson and Miss Fitzmaurice
Gill have much improved upon their original duel
to the death, and the corpse of the former lady
doesn’t compose itself on its flower-bed so con-
spicuously as it did aforetime. One gets used to
being deceased after six weeks’ practice.
Grattan Riggs, as The Bulletin is glad
to see, has recovered the bulk of his lost juvenility.
On Saturday when “Shin Fane” was set up at
the Alexandra, the scene-shifters applied a _ severe
test to the Irish comedian by hauling his mud
cabin skywards before he had got his second leg on
the safe side of the threshold. The scenery caught
Riggs between the limbs, and up he went some
eight feet from the ground with only a thin line
of threshold to repose upon. If he hadn’t grabbed
the side of the domicile with youthful vigor until
his dangerous plight was discovered, and the
scene was lowered to the stage again, “Shin
Fane ” would probably have got a tragic notice in
Monday morning’s press.

The first of Allan’s Saturday afternoon
ballad concerts drew a fairly big crowd to the
Town Hall on the 6th. This Saturday (13th) will
find Marshall Hall and his ever-excellent orchestra
at work in the afternoon, and in the evening
Walter Bentley will produce his Passion Play
pictures on the limelit sheet.
At Poverty Point.
The £3OOO benefit for Lydia Thompson must have owed
its success more to the programme than to any super-
abundance of Cockney enthusiasm for the cause of the
old lady. Her claim upon the public was very small as
compared with Nellie Farren’s, for, whereas Nellie had
been a London institution all her life, Lydia went to
America as a young woman, and, when she turned-up
again in London, some 25 years ago, much of her glory
had departed. Within the memory of middle-aged
theatre-goers, Lydia Thompson has always been a faded
flower, chiefly remarkable for the tales told of her by
their fathers. A good many of the tales came to England
from America. It was said, for instance, that she marked
her respect for the memory of a deceased husband by ap-
pearing in black tights for a whole week.'
Now that Kenningham is substituted for the stranger
who played the Belle of New York’s young man at the
Princess’s, it will occur to many that Wallace Brownlow
might as well have been engaged for the part in Mel-
bourne.
Signor Steffani, writing from Paris, speaks rather dis-
paragingly of vocal art in Europe just now. The number
of capable singers, he says, is small. The Italians rank
highest, “ but their own over-taxed country does not pay
them well enough to stay at home.” Miss Schmidt, who
is travelling with the Steffanis, has as yet not appeared
in public, nor will make any attempt to do so until she
has heard all the best singers. The gifted Florence is
“lying low and keeping her powder dry.”
Mummers are talking of a breach-of-promise case in
which the writ was recently issued; damages, £lOOO.
Alleged that the man got a stage-struck nniden to go on
in pantomime, promised marriage; seduced her; went
away ; married another, much higher in the profession.
Chris. Simonsen, who has been nearly nine years with
Bland Holt, will probably “jack up” the theatrical
world at the end of the present Melb. Royal season, and
devote himself to another line of business. Simonsen for
some time past has worn the wistful expression of a nun
who is amassing secret wealth from ruining speculations,
or something of that sort.
Last Friday night a Melb. gentleman, lately released
from gaol, made a single-handed attempt to capture
Bland Holt’s takings from treasurer Harry Sproule, who
had just arrived, per cab, at the Bank of Victoria with
the boodle in a bag. The scheme failed ingioriously.
Sproule hung on to the bag until the cabman came and
whipped the other fellow off. Being arrested in his flight,
the baffled boodler told a simple tale of how he mistook
Sproule for a man against whom he had a grudge, but
this didn’t explain why he should go for his supposed
enemy’s bag when he ought to have been thirsting for his
blood.
At the Alexandra Palace, London, last week, a high-
rope walker fell 100 feet upon a netting which broke with
the shock and left the poor fellow to continue his flight
into the stalls below. The calamity will serve to silence
a good many people who have belittled Blotidin’s feats
on the assumption that “ anybody ’’ can do nowadays
what that wonderful Frenchman was the first to do. As
a matter of fact, Blondin’s displays of skill and nerve have
never been rivalled. He walked the very high rope, out
of doors and under cover, without any netting in the
business. The net was spread for his imitators, who
didn’t carry confiding fat men on their backs, or push
them along the rope in a wheelbarrow. After having seen
Blondin hump the fat man over the valley of death one
looks rather contemptuously at the performers who have
a net between them and the chance of destruction,
although the impediment, seemingly, is not always
reliable. But it is there, and it acts as a tonic for the
nerves, any way.
The gallows-exhibition (run by warders and policemen)
at that Melb. charity-bazaar was rushed by women and
children. An M.P.’s wife insisted on seeing the mock
execution, and when the “sickening thud” arrived she
showed her appreciation of the show by fainting.
“S.S. I rather like Don’s wild Dutchman in “The
Belle of New York.” Don was badly handled by the first-
night gallery, mainly because most of his voice did not
reach up there, and much of what did was double Dutch
to an Australian crowd. The actor jerks a lot of wild and
woolly eccentricity into the escaped German, who is
billed as a lunatic quite unnecessarily, seeing that he is
not nearly as mad as many others concerned, and remem-
bering that many people are squeamish about laughing
at the caperings of an avowed idiot. The German is not
more mad than the average burlesque of our times, and
it would have been nicer to have written him down an
eccentric or a plain drunk with a homicidal bias.
Countess Russell, the interesting person who brought
ail sorts of charges against her husband a while ago and
now r speaks of him “ in the kindest way,” has just broken
out as a professional actress. The Countess seems to re-
gard her irrepressible self quite seriously in her new
capacity—talks of the “generous praise” she received
for her singing and dancing in a charity-show when she
was seven years younger, and mentions that Fred. Leslie
wanted to engage her for the co. which he might have
formed if he hadn’t died, or changed his mind. Also,
the Countess pretends to believe that she has ceased to be
notorious, and is taking to the stage in an ordinary way
for as much as her mere “talents” are worth, and no
more. She couldn’t bear the idea of presenting herself
as “a titled sensation show,” she says, as though it were
not the only thing she has been doing all her married
life. A sweet specimen of the new womanhood is Countess
Russell!
Of sundry Melbourne pen women who have ventured
upon the stage or the platform, “Rita” (of the ’Erald)isa
long way the best elocutionist. There’s a turn for public
speaking in the family, it seems. “Rita’s” great-grand-
father was the eloquent old sinner, Dr. Price, who acted
as private chaplain to George the Fourth, and afterwards
rounded on his precious royal patron because he didn’t
get the bishopric of London.
Two of Brough’s new pieces, “ Lord and Lady Algy”
and “The Adventure of Lady Ursula,” are still holding
their own at the London theatres where they were first
produced.
Rumored that actor Harry Jewett, formerly of Rig-
nold’s co., had become a preacher in a leading New York
church.

COLUMN
April was a bad month in revenue matters, espe-
cially in N.S. W. The receipts of the five provinces which
issue monthly statements (why Maoriland and S.A. don’t
join in and put the seven provinces on a level passes com-
prehension) were as follows :
lie ADHf f ° r Spared with™
Apru - April, 1898.
Queensland.. „ £344,995 ±12,689
Decrease as com-
pared with
April, 1898.
Tasmania .. 73,720 £4282
Westralia .. .. 197,702 4299
Victoria . .. 597,773 56,993
New South Wales 851,430 96,155
It is long since there was such a unanimous drop. This is
the second consecutive month in which N.S.W. has shown
the worst results of the lot, and the third consecutive
month when it has shown a decrease. Until quite
lately, Westralia occupied the bottom place so regu-
larly that it had got quite used to it. Forrest’s pro-
vince moved up one stage from the bottom in March, and
now it has got up two stages—in fact, instead of being
worst it almost makes a dead-heat with Tasmania this
month for the position of second best.
So far as the present financial year has gone
(to 30th April, except in the case of S.A., whose returns
are only up to 31s, March), the increase or decrease of
revenue is as follows. The figures are not absolutely accu-
rate, because there are always certain refunds, errors, and
readjustments to be attended to before the year’s accounts
are closed; but they are near enough for all practical
purposes:—
Increase as com-
pared with cor-

Decrease as compared
with corresponding
period of 1898.
Westralia (10 months) .. £1,997,744 £252,299
Maoriland closed its financial year on 31st March, and up
to time of writing no accurate information about the
year’s revenue was to hand. The official news re M.L.
finances is so disgracefully slow that a mummy could give
it 10 yards’ start in 100 and beat it badly.
At the end of April, N.S.W.’s expenditure was
£8,361,664, so the deficit for the ten months was £574,724,
which is £187,331 more than the deficit at the same date
last year. This is a good deal of leeway to make up, still
under Premier Reid’s Cash Basis swindle it is quite pos-
sible that it will be made up and that the year will close
with a paper surplus. Under the Cash Basis dodge, the
June expenditure is generally very light. The whole idea
of the C.B. is that the accounts close sharp on 30th June,
and that all the liabilities of the past year which are not
paid then (whether by accident or on purpose) are charged
to next year. And the situation being apparently rather
bad just now the chances are that a good many of
them will be left unpaid. It is simply a matter
of making the balance - sheet look square by omit-
ting all mention of the outstanding liabilities. The
N.S.W. expenditure has increased by 1316,292, as com-
pared with that for the corresponding 10 months of last
year, so it looks as if the policy of economy had dropped
through. And the loan expenditure has increased by
£249,634, as compared with the corresponding 10 months
of last year, and already reaches the gorgeous figure of
£1,637,013. N.S.W. stands third so far as increase of
revenue is concerned, but it is first in increase of expendi-
ture, and also first in increase of borrowing, and it is
getting back very fast to the old loan-boom policy that
Reid used to curse with such a shocked expression of eye-
glass.
Only a few of the provinces follow the good
example of N.S.W. and Queensland by publishing ex-
penditure accounts as they go along, and some of those
which do so publish their accounts rather behind time.
(Also N.S.W. stands almost alone in the matter of supply-
ing regular monthly statements of loan expenditure).
The latest information is as follows :
Surplus.
Queensland (10 months) £686,991
Deficit.
South Australia (9 months) £10,637
Westralia ~ 103,349
N.S.W. (10 months) 574,724
No information is available from Tasmania, Victoria, or
Maoriland. The most notable facts in the above list are
the steady reduction in Westralia’s shortage, which
reached alarming dimensions last November ; and the
huge surplus of Queensland, though interest payments
must reduce it very greatly later on.

The Standard Life Association, Limited, still
another of the small proprietary life-assurance concerns
which are now springing up like mushrooms in Australia,
has started business in Sydney. Like every other new
proprietary concern, it proposes to make industrial assur-
ance a great feature of its business-industrial assurance
appeals to an ignorant class which doesn’t inquire too
much about details. As there is certainly no demand for
a new life-assurance institution in Australia just now,
this country being already over-supplied in that respect,
The Bulletin presumes that the new venture is not so
much designed to fill a “long-felt want,” as to provide
good billets for a few gentlemen in running the show and
to furnish better dividends for the shareholders than they
would be likely to get in any other enterprise.
The Standard, as already mentioned, is going
to run both ordinary and industrial business. The ordi-
nary business will be conducted on the mutual principle,
and The Bulletin has been informed that the ordinary
policy-holders will be allowed the privilege of nominating
part of the directorate. Therefore the inducements to
the ordinary insurer to take out a policy in the Standard
rather than in one of the old-established mutual societies
appear to be just these : —(1) He will have a voice in
appointing part of the directorate instead of the whole as
in the mutual offices ; (2) He is trusting the future of his
widow and family to the solvency of a small, new, untried
concern with limited resources instead of to one which
has large funds and a good record behind it.
Shareholders’ profits are apparently to come out
of the industrial branch, as they do in the Citizens co. The
industrial policy-holder is a stupid beast of burden and
doesn’t kick much, so he probably won’t mind. The
shareholders are to take not more than 10 per cent, divi-
dends and one-fifth of the profits in addition, so they
don’t want much. And, in return, they give remarkably
little. They propose to put up £lO,OOO, in 10,000 shares
of £1 each fully-paid, so that, in the event of a collapse,
there will be no callable capital whatever to fall back
upon. All the risk the shareholders run, and all the security
they offer, is £lO,OOO ; and, when it is considered that it
is a very small insurance institution that isn’t liable
for £1,000,000 to its policy-holders, the alleged “security”
is infinitesimal. And in return for this the shareholders
propose to take £1000 a-year dividends, an in-
definite sum, which may expand in time to £1000
or £5000 a-year in bonuses, arid a number of them
will presumably get billets in the office and good
salaries in addition to their other advantages, so the
small new proprietary life - assurance concern looks
a vastly better spec, for the shareholders than for the
policy-holders. In a few years, with reasonable luck, the
former will have taken out a lot more than they put in,
and the policy-holders will have less security than if there
had never been any shareholders’ capital at all.
The best features about the Standard are that
none of the funds are to be lent to directors, and that the
ordinary life policy-holders are to have some voice in the
appointment of directors—at least Tiib Bulletin has a
verbal assurance on the latter point, though the matter
doesn’t appear to be specifically mentioned in the pro-
spectus. The ordinary proprietary life concern is gener-
ally owned by a very small body of shareholders who
almost all have billets about ttie office, and who appoint
all the directors. Of course they mostly appoint each
other. These people meet once a year to report to
themselves as shareholders what they have done
as directors and managers, and to decide that
everything they have done is correct, and to be formally
audited by their own self-appointed auditor, and to re-
appoint themselves to their comfortable billets, and to
pass votes of thanks to themselves. And the policy-
holders, who supply the mone3% have about as much con-
trol over it as they have over Jupiter. The Standard’s
arrangement looks a shade better than this —just a shade.
The steady-going and reliable Bank of Adelaide
sends along its balance-sheet for the twelve months to
March 27, 1899. The year’s profits are £33,026, which
look verv well as compared with some previous returns :
1892 .. Profit, £31,116 , 1896 .. Profit, £31,225
1893 .. „ 30,976 1897 .. „ 31,046
1894 .. „ 30,763 | 1898 .. „ 33,401
1895 .. ,, 31,048 | 1899 .. „ 33,026
The profits equal £5 17s. lid. per cent, per annum on
shareholders’ funds (paid-up capital, £400,000 ; reserve
fund, £160,000), which, considering that the average bank
earnings nowadays are from £3 to £3 10s. per cent.,*is a
gratifying result for the shareholders. The regular 7 per
cent. div. absorbs £28,000 ; £5000 is added to reserve
fund, making it £165,000 ; and the other £26, added to
previous accumulation, raises the profit balance to
£15,988. The reserve has been increased by £28,000
in the past eight years, so the Bank of Adelaide
has been doing reasonably well in bad times. The
whole reserve-fund and a good deal more is invested
in Govt, debentures. One notable feature is the large re-
serve of cash and liquid securities ; cash and State bonds
alone equal 29 per cent, of all liabilities to the public, and
all liquid securities put together equal about 55 per cent.
Also, the business shows a respectable increase all round.
Altogether, the Bank of Adelaide, now in its 34th year
and notable as one of the few institutions which didn’t
turn a hair at the time of the ’93 disaster, appears to be
doing remarkably well.

The balance-sheet of the London Bank of Aus-
tralia for 1898 isn’t yet to hand, but some items concern-
ing it have arrived per cable. It is stated that there is a
profit of £4572 (equal to 6s. 5d. per cent, per annum on
capital), and naturally there is no dividend. Still, as the
London is still paying the full 4£ per cent, on its recon-
structed deposits, and as ’97 showed a loss of t 8124, and
’96 a loss of £4627, this looks like a very material improve-
ment. The bank is going to pay off about £320,000 of its
4J per cent, deposits due in 1901, and as it will probably
save at least 1 per cent, by this operation, it should make
things about £3200 a year better. Also, it is proposed to
write off £10 a share of the capital as lost. Apparently
the weary process of “ providing for depreciation ” is just
about endless.
* * * *
Tooth and Co., the Sydney brewers, show a
profit of £43,241 for the half-year to 31st March, 1899. A
7 per cent, dividend is paid, absorbing £31,500 ; £5000 is
added to reserve, making it £90,000 ; £2500 is written off
to provide for depreciation ; and the remaining £4241,
added to the old balance, leaves £10,159 at credit of pro-
fit and loss.

The Bulletin receives the prospectus of the
Workmen’s Residence Co. (Sydney). It sets forth that
Mr. John Dwyer, secretary of the Stewards’ and Cooks’
Union, has been, for four years, profitably running a big
lodging-house in Harrington-street, Sydney, and that a
co. is to be formed with £7500 capital to take over and
enlarge the enterprise. The promoter, who is apparently
Mr. John Dwyer, is to get 1500 fully-paid shares gratis—
equal to £1500. It is estimated that the profits will be 20
per cent., in which case Mr. Dwyer, in addition to the
billet and salary of manager, will get £300 a year private
income for life. It is not stated how the estimate is made
up, nor how much the existing lodging-house has paid
under Mr. Dwyer’s management, so it is difficult to judge
of the prospects. But it looks as if it should be a pretty
good thing for Mr. Dwyer.

S.A. keeps its salt-refining industry going. In
’93 the quantity exported was 7115 tons, worth £9341 ;
from that it has moved up steadily until last year the
figures were 30,975 tons, valued at £38,545. The imports
now barely exceed 100 tons. Nearly the whole of the
product is from salt lakes on Yorke’s Peninsula, and one
co. has most of the trade.
' * * * *
South Australia’s solitary coal-mine, the Leigh’s
Creek, on the Gt. Northern line, beyond Pt. Augusta, has
had a hard life. The original co. was formed eight or nine
years ago, but it has had many changes since then. The
only thing that has been quite proved about it is that at
present it can’t compete successfully with Newcastle for
either Adelaide or Broken Hill trade ; and the only hope
now left is to boom copper and other ore-smelting in the
north, and use the local coal for that. With a credit
balance of £10 9s. 2d. the co. faces a cold world, which is,
nevertheless, still doubtful about the heating power of the
coal. Prospects are dreary indeed.

There appears to be a great demand at present
in Victoria for all kinds of bolts and nuts. Mr. Mephan
Ferguson, engineer, &c., of Melbourne, is working night

now supplying orders for Western Australia, and alto-
gether the general foundry business in Melbourne seems

Boulder Main Reef (Lond.) shareholders, whose
mine is still far down on the gold-producers’ list, dug out
the fact at last meeting that their manager was drawing
£1200 a year salary, and is also to get 3 per cent, of the
dividends ! When they read things like this, what must
the feelings be of Bendigo managers, chipping their way
down below 3000ft., following indications imperceptible
to any but the locally-expert man, and combating ventila-
tion troubles, and all for from £3 10s. to £5 a week ?

Wonderful producers are the first-rank Westra-
lian mines. Remember that they are only four years old,
and compare their output with those of some of the re-
liable old Victorian properties, working 30 or 40 years,
sometimes more. The Great Boulder’s 269,688oz. (all
these figures, both Victorian and Westralian, are to the
end of the March quarter) has been passed only by the
Long- Tunnel and Bendigo’s premier, Garden Gully. The
Lake View Consols’ 222,2270 z. may be set against Balla-
rat’s splendid old mine, the Star of the East, or Creswick’s
present premier, Berry Consols; the one has sent out
206,4090 z., the other 190,1860 z. Maldon’s big mine, the
South German Reef, is credited with 99,5580 z., which is
already passed by Hannan’s Brown Hill, with 103,2180 z.
The Boulder has just the advantage of the Long Tunnel
Extended (258,2390 z) and Bendigo’s “old reliables,”
Johnson’s Reef (254,1810 z.) and Great Extended Hustlers
(about 251,000 oz.). The Ivanhoe (11,5,6720 z.) has already
passed New Chum Railway, Shenandoah, Hustler’s Reef,
and other Bendigo mines which have been talked about
for a generation. But, qualifying this somewhat, it must
be remembered that some of these Vic. shows had the
cream skimmed from them before the present co’s got
hold of them.

“C.H.R.”: Despite much jubilation in South

the route, will cheerfully lay (in coppers) 5 to 1 that it
never floats ; 25 to 1 that the line is not constructed to
Mt. Arrowsmith ; 1000 to 1 that it never goes through to
Mt. Lyell; and 100,000 to lit never pays axle-grease. By
the time writer has lost his third wager the Emu Bay
railway will be an ancient institution, bawling bits of
Lyell and Hercules and Rosebery across country to
Burnie. Also, vessels of large tonnage will be gaily
floating out of Hell’s Gates on clean keels with
other chunks of Queenstown’s copper-god ; and every-
body will be baldheaded. Then the Great Magnificent
Western coffee-pot will rush laboriously down the Linda
Valley from off the top of The Frenchman, or somewhere,
into its forlorn cow-shed at Gormanston ; load up with a
pile of badger hides, the last Chinkie on the Wet Coast,
and a water-logged parson, and, with a shriek of despair,
joggle back to the City of Wild Delusions, where nought
is heard but the drip, drip of mouldering walls and the
clank of rusty chains ; and where the population is sup-
posed to be standing around the wharves like a cloud of
pelicans picking the raspberrj'-seeds out of their teeth
with straws and shouting for Federation.

Bendigo miners, working at great depths, begin
to talk of six-hour shifts as a fair thing in the stuffiest

The Kyneton (Yic.) slander case had a
sweet moral in the tip of its tale. A widow
hotel-keeper claimed <£looo damages from a local
farmer for defamation of character, and the farmer
put in a counter claim for rent and cash advanced
to the fair plaintiff. Each side got a verdict for
.£lOO with costs, and the Court adjourned for
refreshments. Litigation is very like billiards.
The opponents come off quits in a couple of
“ hundreds-up ” and the table is the only winner.
“A considerable percentage of the money
some of them could pay their federation dues with
may be devoted to bonuses subsidising their pro-
ducers against ours. . . . There still remains in
this colony the political intelligence which for so
long has held it safe against the foolish system of
self-aggrandisement which in some of the others
has produced a condition of inability to pay their
Federal dues.” —Two extracts from one Sydney
Telegraph leader, sth May, ’99. It seems then
(1) that the other provinces are “unable ” to pay
their federal footing; also (2) that they are quite
able to pay their federal footing, but will prefer to
spend the money on bonuses to their own pro-
ducers. It may be mentioned incidentally that
the Bill forbids them to give bonuses except for
mining purposes (the N.S.W. delegates insisted on
mining bonuses being allowed) but any Geebung
can see that this does not damage the logic of the
argument—much.
Noted in the press that the employes ot

Cardinal Moran justifies church-bazaars on
the ground that the Chief Justice of England
lately stated that <£50,000,000 of British capital
was absorbed within a limited period on bogus in-
vestments. “Bazaars aren’t bogus,” asserts the
Cardinal; “you get something.” The justifica-
tion is not a complete one, but the facts under it
decree study by the promoters, directors, and
shareholders who are pillars of churches affecting
to be scandalised at the minor evil. “ You get
something at a bazaar.”
A striking feature of the S.A. Assembly
election was the heavy poll in the “lower ” agri-
cultural districts, where politics are not supposed
to have much interest. At Clare, for instance,
734 votes of a total of 950 were cast ; at Balaclava
423 of 663; at Stansbury 117 of 133 ; at Virginia
158 of 198 ; and so on. Eurther north, where the
population becomes even more scattered, the pro-
portion was, of course, not so good. But perhaps
the best figures of all were in King O’Malley’s
district; Pt. Victor polled 359 of a total of 397.
Curiously enough, every well-known S. Australian
seaside watering-place is represented in Parlia-
ment by at least one Labor member.
The Bookfellow this month takes another
leap in size ; and the contents are more varied
than previously. There are articles on the French
poet, Baudelaire, and the Australian one, Mary
Foott, with portraits; a notice cf artist Tom

quotations ; the Brownings’ love-letters and E. J.
Brady’s book of verses are reviewed at some
length; Victor Daley contributes a satire in
verse; and there are numerous illustrations and
portraits. Prizes are offered for French transla-
tion and an English quatrain ; and altogether the
number is well worth its modest price of 3d., post

The ship Republic, which twice tried to
get away from N.S. W. with a load of coal, and on
both occasions returned leaking badly, is now said
to have been made seaworthy—though, in the
same breath, the owners aver that when they get
her down to Honolulu she will be dismantled and
used as a hulk. The present situation is that a
crew of 16 has been shipped, all of whom, having
been thoroughly informed of the Republic’s his-
tory, and having been given every opportunity of
inspecting the ship, express confidence in her
safety and avow themselves eager to go to sea
without delay. The Marine Board, at latest, was
considering the matter. The Bulletin wishes
the Republic’s crew a good voyage. The third
time is proverbially lucky.
The contest between Andrew Rowan, of
Melbourne, financial schemester, and “Joe”
Flanagan, his ex-manager and bitterest foe, has
reached an interesting stage. Flanagan, as here
mentioned a while ago, scattered a pink-covered
pamphlet around with a view to (putting it mildly)
making Rowan look rather worse than the aver-
age Melbourne speculator. This by way of retali-
ation for, and defence against, the charges of busi-
ness sin and wickedness which his former control-
ling colleague had, for reasons best known to them-
selves, chosen to publish in a loud and frequent
tone of voice. Rowan’s yarns and Flanagan’s
pamphlet are the utterances of two rabid
people who worked together for 12 years, and now
wish that each other were dead and damned in
the hell set apart for loyal Orangemen. The up-
shot of Flanagan’s printed screech was his appear-
ance, last week, at Melb. General Sessions, on two
charges of larceny as a servant (of Rowan), eight
years ago. The Crown prosecuted, and Rowan
didn’t appear in person. Flanagan stated all sorts
of things re Rowan and his 21 various banking
accounts, and in the end the jury found Flanagan
not guilty. Two other charges were put back for
hearing at June Sessions. Meanwhile, Flanagan’s
action against Rowan, for malicious prosecution,
looms in the distance, and the pamphlet is circu-
lating in places where the tongue of Rowan is
never heard. The quarrel appears to be a most
deserving case for publicity.
On Monday night, at the crowded Masonic
Hall in Castlereagh-street, Sydney, Copeland,
M.L.A., tore to shreds the fetish of disinterested-
ness which the Geebung press has hung around the
necks of those great and good patriots, McLaurin
and Pilcher. The Doctor is a director of the
Colonial Sugar Co., and Mr. Pilcher and Mr.
Carey (the chairman of the D.T. Newspaper Co.)
are shareholders. This co. has a paid-up capital
of nearly two millions sterling, and a great deal
of it is invested in Fiji sugar-plantations, which
are worked with cheap colored labor. The nigger-
grown sugar gets free access into W.A., and access
at a low tariff into N.S.W. and S.A., and
when Federation comes along the chances are
that it will be shut out for the benefit of that
grown by white labor in N.S.W. and Queens-
land; and these anti-Federal leaders are in-
terested in blocking Federation to the extent
of their incomes from the Colonial Sugar Co.
The interest of Barton and Reid, with their paltry
possible prizes of a thousand or two a year for a
more or less limited period is a mere flea-bite
beside this gigantic interest. And when Cope-
land launched this large, jagged fact into the Gee-
bung diaphragm that noisy animal howled with
agony. When R. E. O’Connor spoke, he went on
another tack and gave the most lucid and easily-
followed explanation of the Federal Constitution
Bill that has yet been publicly submitted. And
when the voting came on, there was the usual
overwhelming majority for Federation.

Gov. and Viscountess Gormanston gave a
farewell reception at Hobart t’other day—ere

One lady went up to Jenico, giving him her hand

SABBATH BREAKERS.
THE SHEPHERD (addrassm! little boy who has been playing marbles on
the Sabbath) : “ Do you know where you will go to if you play
marbles on Sunday?”
LITTLE BOY: “No, sir.”
THE SHEPHERD: “ It’s to hell you’ll go; aye, to hell.”
LITTLE BOY (to his sister) : “ Come away, Jennie, the man is swearing.”
hip tears from her eyes fell on the hand that signs
Gormanston, Governor.” “Oh, come, come,”
said liis Ex., “that’s too much.” “I beg your
pardon, sir,” was the reply, “but I have a very
severe cold in the head.” Hence these tears.

The desire of N.S.W. Mounted Rifles to
be converted into cavalry has, up to date, resulted
only in permission to call their half-companies
“squadrons”—which is about as absurd as to
speak of a “fleet ” of artillery, or a “ battery ’’ of
policemen. And, no matter what they’re called,
the M.R. must remain only “toe-soldiers” on
horseback. The main argument against arming-
tliem with swords is that there aren’t any swords
IP arm " em with, and very little preseht
likelihood of there being any. The Ist Australian
Horse (now in existence nearly two years) are
mostly unarmed yet. To bring, them into last,
camp, a collection of rust-eaten swords and ancient
cai j ), “ es had to be borrowed from the Artillery
and Lancers, so that the Mounted Rifles, who.
will presumably have to wait for their swords
until after the Ist A.H. are armed, will have
much ado to get these weapons in time for the
battle of Armageddon. According to the Minister
for War, X.S. \\ . defences are now in a very good
state ; but present writer, who knows a good deal
about them, and isn’t a believer in the effective-
ness of unarmed regiments, reckons it’s good!
enough to leave for the mountains and crawl into,
a hollow log when the long-expected enemy arrives.
M.L. Women’s Convention, having had
its usual corrobboree, the men have taken a hand
and what they demand is a
ing-Houses Bill. The idea is that every boarding-
house bed must have two clean sheets a week,
though some of the Bill-passers, who live at home,
confess they don t have more than one. A number
of the men displayed considerable housewifely
knowledge in their exposition of the vulgar
method of sheet-changimr, whereby when the
lower is resigned to Falstaff’s “buck basket,,” the
upper is brought down to do a week’s duty in its
place.

The Women’s Council has need of every man it

“P.A.”: There has
been much sentiment
wasted over the oppres-
sion of the Irish in Ire-
land, but when they leave
that most distressful spot,
the sons of Erin seem to
get a fair share of what’s
going. For instance, Mick
Kelly, wild at being
bunco’d out of a 30s. ring,
shoots Ellen Flynn, his
lover, who is at same
time mistress of Pat
Carey, whose glossy top-
hat and frock - coat aid
him in getting square
with the Sassenach op-
pressor. Constables Flan-
agan and O’Leary arrest
Kelly; warderM‘Manus
locks him up ; O’Toole
walks the ramparts, with
a gun, to see he don’t es-
cape ; solicitor Paddy
Crick advises him; bar-
rister Moriarty defends
him ; and Judge O’Con-
nor lets him down aisy
wid seven years. As
Signora M a’r aker i t a
Mooreo sings, “There’s
nothin’ too good for the
Irish." With such an ar-
ray of Hibernian talent
in the caste, it’s a wonder
Kelly wasn’t let off with
a pension and a lump sum
to start a pub.

“ Old Jack ” : That
monstrous Carlton (Mel-
bourne) sentence of six
months’ “ hard,” to Sa-
rah Robertson, for child-
abandonment, brought
about a big public meet-
ing to protest. The sen-
timent of the gathering
was all right, but some
of the talk was mere rot.
One speaker, for in-
stance, said that this
sort of thing couldn’t
happen in “ Old Eng-
land.’’ Couldn’t it? Pre-
sent writer has known an
old woman get 12 months
for taking a few sticks out
of a hedge. Has known
(my own uncle was on
the Bench) a boy get six
months’ hard, for tickling trout. There isn’t, in
fact, a mean, base, brutal thing that ever hap-
pened anywhere that can’t be paralleled in dear
old England.

“A.P.H.”: Reform is badly needed in
the administration of justice in N.W. Westralia.
A few months ago a Govt, resident, who had been
a tide-waiter, was invested with the power of a
Judge of the Supreme Court to try a Malay for
murder. This so-called Judge actually expounded
the law, and told the jury it wasn’t manslaughter,
the jury found prisoner guilty, and the acting-
J udge passed the death-sentence. When prisoner
was brought down to Fremantle for execution
the public raised such a cry that the sentence has
not yet been carried out. It is on record that a
i .M. in the north-west once granted a woman a
divorce. Women were scarce there, and someone
had an eye to her !
South Australian court idlers gloat over
the new brand of affiliation-cases— those in which
a demand is made for the prepayment of Mrs
s fees and the cost of baby-clothes. The
Act doesn t allow more than two months’ linen to
be claimed ; another beak’s order has to be made
before the newcomer can be short-coated with its
pa s money—and, by that time, it may be better
on the evidence of the child’s looks, to bring some
other pa into the case. In the country, especi-
ally, the local Mrs. Clamp's charges are gone
into minutely, and the court struggles gal-
lantly with the price of—various baby articles.

And here’s another: A 19-year-old
Kiverinan got married on Monday, be-
carne a father on Tuesday, widower on
Wednesday, and married his deceased
wifes sister a fortnight later. Though
wearing mourning at her wedding, the
latter bride appeared much relieved about
something or other.

At a banquet the other evening in
honor of a policeman who was getting
married, the local P.M. particularly com-
plimented the young man on the fact
that he was always “truthful.” The
trooper in the course of his reply stated
that he had always tried to be truthful
even if he should lose his case !
After Tod and Radalyski had been sen-

, inspector in a certain Australian
charitable department called to see an infant on
nis fist, but only saw the foster-parent, who ex-
plained that the child was out for a walk but
would be brought round to the inspector’s office
next day. A child was accordingly brought
round ; and the same thing occurred half-a-dozen
times-child never at home, but always produced
afterwards at office. But one day when the in-
spector called, and the guardian was out, he
noticed the little girl playing in yard of next
house, and observed to a man whom he saw there
I hats a pretty child. Her father would not

child 12 or 14 months before, and had made use of
the neighbor’s child to impersonate her. Things
would have gone very hard for the culprit if the
original girl had not been produced \ and as it was
she got four months’ gaol on the technical charge

of Australia. Re-marrying the innocent mem-
ber is, from the standpoint of Christian ethics,
as indefensible as re-marrying the guilty. Re-
marriage makes it impossible for the guilty
divorced to be pardoned by the innocent in
this life. Whatever offences a divorce law may
set up as sufficient for a decree, these remain
offences capable of being atoned for like all other
human offences, and when atonement is made
the parties may agree to forgive and forget, or
return to the old relation ; but if either re-marry
the possibility of a complete pardon of the guilty
person, with the reward for repentance, is ended

f I >HE ACETYLENE GAS industry is making
A- rapid strides throughout the Australasian
colonies. Although it is not long since the
.. flcetylene Gas Company
of Australasia Ltd.
commenced operations in Sydney, quite a large
number of Stores, Hotels and Private Dwellings
in the city and country are lit up with this beauti-
ful illuminant with universal satisfaction. Owing
to the enormous demand for Carbide, the Directors
have decided to immediately proceed with the
ERECTION of CARBIDE WORKS, and ere
long the industry must become exceedingly pros-
perous.
The Directors have also decided to close the
list for the First Issue of Shares on Bth MAY,
All applications must be in the hands of the Secre-
tary not later than 2nd May, and it would be well
for investors to send for prospectus and full in-
formation concerning Acetylene Gas.
Country folk should call and inspect the light
when in town, as it offers many advantages over
all other illuminants.
The Registered Office of the Company is 36

“H.”: Geelong awoke
this morning, and half
fancied its pivot was
gone, with the news
that the legal firm of
Taylor, Bucldand, and
Gates had been swal-
lowed up by its rival,
Harwood and PincOtt.
What a biz. T.B. and
G. used to do in the
days when the roost
was ruled by such
potent names as Ar-
inytage, Austin,
Bell, Black, Mani-
fold, Robertson,
Rutledge, and
Ware as the
landed aristo-
cracy of the
West! But
they chop up
to farms, and
that very smart
man Harwood had
long drawn out
the backbone of
the remains of
the all-demised
Taylor, Buck-
land, and Gates
ere the body
fell into hi s
arms. The firm
of T.B. and G. was
the only Geelong, or,
indeed, provincial
one, in the last gen-
eration which squarely
ranked beside such Mel-
bourne legal lucre-rakers as
Klingender, Charsley, and
Liddle, Muttlebury and
Malleson, Duerdin, Bronck-
horst, and Smale, Nutt
and Murphy, or Vaughan,

The Bulletin suspects that the young lady con-
nected with Tyson’s estate really works in a

game to bet that the cavalryman is a blushful
young fellow from the country who knows a lot
about gray horses, and very little of fair girls.

“E.P.” . Some days after Burgess was re-
leased from gaol, writer was in a Queen-street
(Brisbane) bar, when entered two detectives with
a stranger —a strong, unevenly-made man, with
fierce eyes and moustache and recently-shaven
chin. The three had whiskies, then one of the
D’s introduced the stranger as Richard Burgess.
Latter put out his paw and affably inquired,
“Think I look like a murderer? No, by !
You look more like one yourself. These s
want to get me drunk. They reckon I know some-
thing.” Whereupon one of the D’s told him to
“shut,” while the other winked at me and sug-
gested I should “set ’em up.”

A young man who -started out to get mar-
ried in Albert Park, S. Melb., the other day, had
an even more unfortunate day than wedding-
days usually are. Going out of his own front-
gate, rather too eagerly, perhaps, he fell down a
step and dislocated his collar-bone. After being
fixed up, he made haste to the wedding, and was
badly bitten in the trousers by an immoral dog
which resented his impetuosity. Having changed
the lacerated garments for a sound set, he made
an effort to “ get there” in a cab, and the horse
bolted, injuring a Chinese hawker, and carrying
the anxious bridegroom a quarter-of-a-mile beyond
his church before throwing him out and damaging
his scalp. The hero had another try, and reached
the church, but fell again heavily on the chancel
steps, and the ceremony had to be further delayed
whilst kindly people rubbed him and gave him
drinks, and assured him that he’d be all right
presently. And yet he married the girl, after all.
Some men don’t recognise an interposition of Pro-
vidence when they meet it.

A Tittle Lonsdale-street (Melb.) damsel
lately blew her brains out because the “mash ’’
whose suppers she had been paying for smiled on
another Flossie. The Don Juan was a pianist at
a neighboring abode of joy—which is only in
accordance with the usual state of things, for such
is the power of music that the fancied inamorata
of the city sharebroker, and the cunning bookie,
nearly always hands over half the cash she
wheedles out of her “protector” to a pianist.
This is the sort of man that women kill them-
selves over, or try to kill themselves —for there

The Melb. Anti-Sweating League lately
received a complaint that a Flinders-lane soft-
goods firm, having a very influential person at its
head, was giving out the manufacture of babies’
dresses to a middleman who again sub-let the work
at the rate of half-a-crown a dozen ! Nothing
could be done, as babies’ dresses are reckoned
dressmaking work, and are exempt from the pro-
visions of Vic. Factories Act ; but during the dis-
cussion a female delegate from the Tailoresses
Union remarked that the same firm was getting
blouses made for grown women at a shilling a
dozen. The “Song of the Shirt” has apparently
been written in vain.

“ Sir, I would not marry the best man on
earth!”
“Quite right; these goody-goody fellows are awfully
uninteresting.”
Ward, acquitted of murder in Adelaide,
on the ground of insanity, was, they all say, “ a
lucky beggar.” Born dull. No education. Went
into a training-stable. Had some awful falls.
Twice was long unconscious after being thrown.
Speech became dull and thick. Has “ scars and
marks on his head, also a scar 3in. long on his
neck ; marks on one leg, and a dimple on the other
leg, apparently from shot.” Had often to sweat
himself down 2st. Suffered from headaches ; cured
them at the time by firing off a gun resting against
his head. Became known as “Balmy Frank.”
Now, is to be “detained during the Governor’s
pleasure.” Acquitted—yes ; some men do have all
the luck.
The old and the new were hopelessly in
conflict over Ward’s case. Dr. Paterson, for
nearly 30 years officer at one of S.A.’s
lunatic asylums, represented the old ; he diag-
nosed extreme mental shakiness, though he
couldn’t go much farther than that. Dr. Ramsay
Smith, one of the Govt.’s newly imported men,
after witnessing the same tests, diagnosed a good
deal of stupidity and some shamming. But S.A.
juries don’t like hangings, even though in that
province the prisoner merely has to walk along to
the end of a corridor and drop through a trap in
the floor; and they laid hold of the doubt to
save the man’s neck and send him into confine-
ment for just so long as the authorities like to
keep him.

The Sydney anti-Federal party made one
fearful mistake at the M‘Laurin-Pilcher meeting
last Friday. The hall was packed with provin-
eialists, admitted early by ticket, and apparently
arrangements had been made for ehucking-out all
Federalists. But the gentleman who got up to
open the meeting in the Public Debt Repudiation
interest was unknown to most and inaudible to
the rest, and they took him for an enemy, and
called out “ Chuck ’im hoff ! ” And in an instant
the chucker-out appeared from the back of the
platform, grabbed the orator of bis own
party, and heaved him head-first into the audi-
ence. Then the mistake was discovered, and he
was grovelled and apologised to, and hoisted back
on the platform green with rage—as any man
might be who had been chucked out by his own
special chucker.

Some portions of S. W. Queensland are in
a terrible state from drought. Premier Dick-
son thought of tripping westward, t’other day,
and a well-known squatter immediately arranged
for taking 5000 drought-stricken sheep down to
the Warrego and drowning them there before the
Premier’s eyes—by way of object-lesson. How-
ever, Dickson didn’t go ; so the sheep will perish
by the customary, less-merciful process.

“N.”: The Salvation Army has been
steadily on the wane in England for years. Booth’s
decline in England may be traceable to his hatred
of Socialism. Every officer infected with it is
fired out. The General is mostly financed by
millionaires, who dab down a thou, at a slap,
because he is fighting the socialistic forces.
A number of Jews and
tiles in Melbourne have arranged to
offer an expression of cash sympathy
for Freedman, of the Eastern Mar-
ket, the plucky fellow who lost his
eye in a struggle with “ Professor ”
Medor, after that wild astrologist
had killed Stevens. Freedman’s
luck was especially cruel, for he
seems to have been the one man in
the Market with a kindly feeling
towards the unfortunate murderer.
At the inquest he spoke up for
Medor just as though nothing had
happened to cool their friendship.
Asked as to how long the Market
jokers had been subjecting Medor to
annoyance, Freedman replied, “Ever
since he came there.” The loss of an
eye at the prisoner’s hands did not
blind him to the prisoner’s grievances.
Men like Freedman are rare ; also, they
are more Christian than the Christians.

It is some years since artist Charles

Paris, where he has had several pictures
hung in the Salon. Then Phil May (resi-

wide reputation. Sculptor Bertram Macken-

despite bad health, has steadily built-
up a reputation for himself. And
now a cable tells that three Austra-
lians have had pictures accepted in
London Academy’s present exhibi-
tion : Arthur Streeton one, David
Davies and Percy Spence two each.
Rupert Bunny, another Australian,
has won recognition in the Old

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, May 9, 1899.
My Dear Myee—
This city is working up a noble resolve to do
something quite out of the common by way of
welcome to Lord Beauchamp. What the Some-
thing is to be is not yet decided. But the blare
and glare must be worthy an Earl who is a
Bachelor. And the fluttering of streamers—not
necessarily cap-streamers—will start from his
landing, and may never cease till the great “I
will ” is sounded.
The Earliest bird is a Sydney lady. She wrote
by the mail after the cabled news of the Earl’s
appointment, and requested (and has received)
His Ex. ’s patronage and presence at some charity
tableaux in May. “ Patronage ” and “ presence ”
and “Your Excellency” had a sweet new ring
about them at that time, and at that space, that
refused to be denied.
Turning to the other side of the case— le Roi est
mart —Julius Knight has gone back to London.
He farewelled Sydney after the “Lady of
Lyons ” last Thursday night. A hero smothered
in laurels, he announced that it was not likely
Sydney would evah see him again. A voice from
the gods called out “ Garn ! ” But a sentiment of
young Byron’s, “ Fare thee well, and if for evah,
still for evah fare thee well, ” brought the situation
back to its true inwardness.
An unrehearsed flower-scene took place that
same evening. Long ago Miss Ferrar requested,
on the play-bill, that no flowers should be handed
her on the stage. Floral tributes were to be all
sent round to the back. This was (’tis said) be-
cause the gentle Julius sometimes refused to pick
up her bouquets for her.
Whether it was the last night in Sydney or his
own speech that did it, Julius’ hard heart
softened in the presence of that big house. When
the theatre broke into flowers at Miss Ferrar’s
feet, he stepped forward, and gathered and took
them towards her. But Ada put out that long,
thin arm of hers—terrible thing for a woman to
have thin arms—and smiled a sad, good smile,
and waved him ever so firmly and effectively
away. Some people think that was the most spirited
performance Miss Ferrar has given in this city.
Musical tastes must be on the rise when a pro-
gramme like the Amateur Orchestral’s last can
draw a crowded house to the Sydney Town Hall
without the slightest V.R. assistance. There was
no party from Govt. House, and there was a
Symphony of Beethoven’s—the Sublime Seventh—
with an andante so exquisite that no one could
fail to get some sweetness from it, but with
other movements that the intellect must stretch
to encircle. And there was a Wagner overture
that came at the end of the programme, and
found a full house waiting for it. And the over-
ture to Massenet’s “Phedre”, and Raff, Berlioz,
Meyerbeer, and Gounod, by way of lightness.
And Hector M‘Lean’s pretty “ Doedalian ” march
and Goring-Thomas’ “ Heart is Weary ” (sung by
Miss Blanche Thomas), by way of sheer frivolity.
If anybody found the programme heavy, it was
the performers and, perhaps, the people in the
front row. The rest of the audience wore quite a
classically beatified expression.
This worthy society is in a splendid condition
financially. Thirty members wrote, before the
last concert, offering increased subscriptions for
extra tickets.
At this rate I do think Sydney might put a
little gloss on its musical vernacular and give up
declaiming so brassily about the “ Shopping
shirts, oh !” the “Andantyby Beet-Oven!” and
the “ Sell-oli solo ! ”
“The Merry Wives of Windsor,” now gambol-
ling at the Criterion Theatre under Rignold’s
guidance, are rather a young-looking lot taken as
a. whole. Miss Roxy Barton, despite a black wig,
is altogether too slim and girlish in looks and act-
ing for Dame Quickly. Ann Page, in the hands
of Celia Mavis, looks a mere schoolchild. Lilian
Wheeler adds nothing to her years by a light-red
wig and tall white cap. Miss Watts-Phillips is
the only one of the group who is mellow enough
for Shakespeare’s meaning. In a scarlet-velvet
costume slashed up one side with green, a silver
belt, and a coquettish white cap over her dark-red
hair, she achieves quite a triumph of make-up and
frocking. Without any pretensions to good looks,
she has savoir faire enough to outshine girls with
reputations as beauties.
After “The Belle of New York,” I wondered
what I had been doing for the last three hours. A
play of shreds and patches, if you like ! Nowhere
do two shreds stick together. The story recedes,
advances, disappears, gloom settles down, and all
hope of finding anything is lost; a little singing
out of tune, a little less in tune ; good clothes, an
idiot, some brilliant kicking and somersaulting, a
hint of the plot again, then darkness, and a feel-
ing of weird wonder when everyone gets up to go
home, and nothing has yet begun to happen.
The Belle herself, Louise Hepner, is a large
Amurrcan, built on true Amurrcan lines. A
broad forehead with the hair suggested lightly in
natural-looking locks, a long chin, a curving
mouth, and not so much chic as one expected.
She looked her best in her little blue Army bonnet
with the red lining. The demurely-parted hair
suited that saintly frocking. But in a naughty
little frilled white skirt to the knees, and a big,
yellow-quilted bonnet with white feathers droop-
ing over the brim, the demureness was knowing-
ness, and the face aged and hardened.
Nearly all the women part their hair in the
middle, wear long sleeves to the knuckles, full
apron or frilled skirts, and wide hats turned
straight up m front. Slender figures look out of
place. Broad hips are the fashion, and the skirts
are allowed to stand well out at the sides.
Little Marguerite Ferguson is a dear little crea-
ture, with roguish eyes, and a backbone that
accommodates itself to somersaults and kissing the
ground backwards. She dances charmingly, and
has more “go ” than-all the other women in this
sad, bad case. Her prettiest froeking was a little
turquoise skirt lined with dull-pink ; shoes, stock-
ings, and sash, and pink roses on the shoulder.
Another taking fair-headed little person is Miss
Belle Buck] in, as Fifi Fricot. She is very like
Ada Reeve in appearance, with the same wide
smile. But her voice, both in speaking and in.
singing, rasps to a degree.
For artlessness, go and watch the way this com-
pany takes its encores. Two claps, and back they
all come and do it all over again. Sometimes one
clap brings them back. And once, I declare,
they came back for nothing but a laugh. The
orchestra helps out this little game by keeping up
a loud noise that is supposed to drown the
thunders of applause that are not there. Perhaps
the only genuine encores were for Ketiningham’s
own song-—a monotonous ballad, owing every-
thing to his singing—and Girard’s comic evolu-
tion, “A cloud came o’er his brow.”
Wilson Barrett should be here to see another
charity “Dramatic,” fixed for May 12th, at the
Railway Institute. Who, think you, is going to
perform? _ The very A.N.R. himself, who caused
such frenzied ink-slinging in theatrical circles a
year ago by showing spots on Wilson Barrett’s
Hamlet. Assisted by Miss Mercy Murray, Mr.
Nugent Robertson is going to play a little piece of
his own called “A Proposal of Marriage.”
Miss Eva Mylott’s concert was unusually suc-
cessful for the effortof alocal singer. The Y.M.C. A.
Hall was crowded to the door, and many people
were turned away. That does not often happen
to a singer living within our gates. In a long
princess robe of pale heliotrope brocade, with gold
embroideries on the bodice, the handsome, dash-
ing-looking contralto would have won her way on
her looks alone. Being a contralto, her songs
were mostly devotional—either to God or the dear
dead past beyond recall. “Abide with me, fast
falls the eventide ” was a little ahead of that lovely
copper-colored hair and elegant figure. “Caro
Mio Ben,” given as an encore to “Out on the
rocks, ” was more suitable to her age and appear-
ance, and showed the rich notes at their best,
which is good indeed. Miss Edith King, Miss
Marie Narelle, Messrs. Burns-Walker, Lawrence
Campbell, and Lawrence Phillip, helped to build
up a delectable evening, whose purpose was to
assist Miss Mylott to a trip ’Ome and further
study.
The Broughs had a wonderful house last Satur-
day, when the “Adventure of Lady Ursula”
began. Never a point missed fire. The audience
was as inflammable as a haystack, and each act
saw treble recalls. That beautiful Joseph Carne
shines prominently. His quiet method and ‘ ‘satis-
fying’’face thrilled all the women in the house.
To say nothing of the admirable way in which he
wore clothes a hundred-odd years too old for him.
In a black brocade coat, showing deep puce linings,
a close brown queue, pink vests and black knee-
breeches, he added new meaning to the old, old
charge against the crudeness of the present-day
black-suit in a stage setting. With the eighteenth-
century clothes there is no need to puzzle out the
difference between the waiter and the gentleman.
Mrs. Brough, too, wears some delightful frocks.
Her brown mop of curls is tied right up on top of
her head with a black velvet bow. She enters in
a polonaise of creamy brocade, laced up the back
and opening in front over a gold silk petticoat
edged with two lace flounces and gold rosettes. A
black velvet hat and long yellow feathers
further explain why men ran away with women
so hot-headedly last century. In her brother’s
blue satin cloak -and knee-breeches, she was
adorable—almost too delightful a boy for a city
like this, where the “boy” is not a very delight-
ful animal.
The Sydney University students who have been
so much criticised and satirised in the matter of
last Commemoration proceedings, state that this
was merely a full-dress rehearsal, as will be also next
year’s doings. The real outburst on the part of
the University is expected to take place in the
year 1901, when the seat of learning will celebrate
the 50th anniversary of its birth.
There is still a continual thinning in the ranks
of possible competitors for the position of Her Ex.
Before 18th May Miss Genevieve Fattorini, a
Darling Point damsel of the soft Italian type of
beauty, will have wedded her fiance. The bride-
groom-elect is a handsome Italian of good connec-
tions. One or two University weddings are also
spoken of, but nothing definite has been decided as
yet. Perhaps the intending parties feel that the
public might like a rest from University weddings.
Mr. Arthur Griffith, the Labor member, erstwhile
a master at Sydney Grammar School, was quietly
married last week at All Saints’ Church, Peter-
sham. The bride —Nurse Smith from the Coast
Hospital—was given away by her godfather, Dr.
Creed. By way of honeymoon, the happy pair
went off on their bicycles on a tour up North.
This year’s annual pocket-picking in aid of hos-
pitals was brilliantly successful, from the picker’s
point of view £3700 gathered in. But I
have not heard of any more romantic contribu-
tions such as —well, say, men. Ever since a Syd-
ney belle collected a wealthy Englander into her
little box the hope has been that what had
been might be again. And, of course, it
may be again. But—well, men are getting used
to it. One heavily-gilded swagger went to town
the day before the collection and changed his
money into threepences and pennies. The three-
pences were for Pretty Women. The pennies were
for Plain Girls. When a man comes down to
threepence to a pretty woman the chance of him
giving himself is decidedly shaky. Even at six-
pence there would have been a hope (nice wooden-
headed dolls in the markets for sixpence). But
threepence!—“Shall I compare thee to a three-
penny-bit ! ” Impossible.
A mysterious London correspondent has written
me a long letter about Madame Alva. He —I
don’t know why I should imagine it is a “he ”
wants to remonstrate with me because I once spoke
of Alva and Schmidt as two “sopranos.” Bracket-
ing them together thus seems to have wounded
him, and he sends along a paper to show how
highly Alya is valued at Home. Unfortunately,
the paper is a little provincial one, and its criti-
cism has to do with a provincial charity concert, at
which all the performers were praised with highly-
colored words. Not that I mean to infer that
Alva—magnetic, passionate, dramatic Alva —
could ever be a provincial kind of singer. I am
only amused at the way in which her advocate
innocently undermines her London-market value.
The letter winds up—“ Soon Sydney will have the
treat of hearing Alva in grand opera, brought out
by—you-know-whom ? ” (I don’t. Do you?)
That rumor anent a certain University pro-
fessorship appears to be a more or less solemn fact.
The truth is said to be that one of the Sydney pro-
fessors desires to forsake his “little gun yah ” for a
post in Edinburgh rendered vacant by the retire-
ment of a celebrated man. Of course others have
applied for the position, and one of them at least
is considered a formidable rival to the Sydneyite.
Should the latter be successful, however, a Melb.
man will probably take his place. The Sydney
prof, has long had a leaning towards Edinburgh,
and the Melb. medico has long cherished a secret
weakness for Sydney.
The photo, -fiend is becoming absolutely rampant
at fashionable weddings. At a recent affair
everyone and everything in the house was photo’d
several times over, after the ceremony. But a
still more striking instance arose last week when
a much-bedecked bride, accompanied by her
newly-wed husband and suite, drove straight from
the church to a studio in town and there was
taken in several ingenuous attitudes. The street
was blocked with sightseers on the look-out for a
free show when the bridal-party emerged from
the studio.
A local New Jerusalem has been dis-
covered. It is located in the consequen-
tial little township of Bombala ; and the
general trend of the Bombala nose is towards
hooks and I’s—lsaacs, Israels, and so on. Already
they are putting on airs there, just to get ’em into
form before they are made the Federal Capital.
All the local Bombala news is now carefully
gathered up, washed and starched, and packed off
to the Sydney dailies, and we can turn up our
own Hekald any day for the account of how Mrs.
Smith’s baby fell out of its pram., and who was at
the committee meeting to suppress pigs in Bom-
bala, and that it is “Anticipated that the local
ball will be a great success, ” and other racy items.
Children have their own ideas of acting. Here
is a precocious child’s thought about love-scenes.
“People never kiss each other long enough when
they meet, after they haven’t seen each other for
years and years. They just get hold of hands and
have a kiss, and look at each other, and then they
talk ; but 1 think they oughtn’t to say anything,
but the man ought to put his arms round the
woman and just hold her till she cracks.”
Which recalls the fact that a woman did crack
the other day in England. She was “ a dear old
thing,” and a number of girl-visitors hugged her
so that they broke three of her ribs, and when the
mail left she was lying in a dangerous condition.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ Bishop Field Flowers Goe and Wallace Brown-
low supplied the most interesting ‘ turn ’ at Allan’s
Ballad Concert last Saturday afternoon. It came
to pass in this way. The Bishop, who had the
moral support of Mrs. Goe and a lady friend, was
earnestly endeavoring to approve of the dissipation
from a front seat in the far-side balcony, when
item number 13 (the d l’s number, alas !) took
the platform. Brownlow, bold and beautiful in
his well-built frock-coat, began to sing Rudyard
Kipling’s ‘Mandalay,’ a ballad unfitted for the
ears of any professional pietist. Before the
reckless baritone had got through the first
verse the Bishop became aware that he
was inhaling pagan sentiments, whereupon he
set his face towards the clock with a fixed expres-
sion of grief. The next verse seemed to send a
shudder through the episcopal anatomy, and
finally, when the warbler desired to be shipped to
the other side of Suez, ‘ where there ain’t no Ten
Commandments and a man can raise a thirst, ’ the
Bishop turned his attention upwards, wondering,
perhaps, wh t ’, - roof of the Town Hall didn’t fall
in and sma-.i concert. The worst of it was
that the mulb • brought W.B. back to repeat
his insult to t .1 Commandments, whilst Mrs.
Goe positive. nied on the sinner all the time.
Even a .-> lady seems no exception to the
rule that every woman is at heart a Mosaic Law
breaker.
“ At the chrysanthemum show, an exhibitor got
a special certificate for a floral tombstone—a fine,
upstanding cross and pedestal of immortelles, tin-
foil, &c. Should this notion catch on, senders
will have to provide porters for their floral tributes,
or ruin mourners with cartage fees.
“ The ‘ Belle, ’ with slick Kenningham tacked on,
got quite a cosy send-off. Lady Brassey, her sil-
very coiffure imparting a sort of p°udre effect,
looked extra-distinguished in all white, as she sat
half-turned away from the house, and appeared for
the nonce a rose of to-day. Countess Ranfurly,
whose handsome, hardish features give her some-
what the air of a human camelia, wore royal blue
splashed with jet.
“Besides her nightly posy of modest violets,
Louise Hepner got floral horse-shoes, &c. The
whole troupe of ‘ Innocents Abroad ’ were more
or less praised and petted. That Artemus
Wardian jester Girard was so pampered that he
suddenly announced his domestic arrangements
from the steeple by pointedly addressing plump
‘ Miss Gleeson ’as ‘ Mrs. Girard. ’ Had the bab-
bler been fatally beautiful, his brusque method of
breaking the news might have led to trouble.
“Melbourne folks had just started to take an
interest in the real, live countess lately discovered
to be domiciled as parlor-boarder at the Loretto
Convent, Ballarat, when news came of her sudden
death aboard the India, which was bearing the
fair globe-trotter hence. The Countess Elizabeth
Wolff Metternich was positively young, wealthy,
and beautiful. The blood of the kings of Hungary
was in her modest blush, and the halo of Saint
Elizabeth glorified her royal lineage.
‘ Society scribes compare the market values of
the respective matrimonial prizes bagged by those
buxom sisters. At the time of the earlier capture
the gaunt young benedict was said to be worth at
least £4OOO a year, not to speak of great expecta-
tions haloing the hoary head of his favorite grand-
aunt or sich ; and in those days, too, awe-inspiring
rumors circulated re said bridegroom’s 1 ancestral
hall, ’ one of ‘ the stately homes of England, ’ by
all accounts. These died down as time passed
and the happy pair still lingered longer here-
about, as if loth to exchange their social promin-
ence, even in these beastly colonies, for the
splendors of hubby’s ‘ palace by the Lake of
Como.’ Now fickle chroniclers gush over the
plump Australian mullet landed lately by another
daughter of the same clan, and little sister’s gold-
fish is declared to be only a silver one after all.
“ Nellie Stewart the other day told a London in-
terviewer, in a burst of confidence, that she ‘ builds
up her waist ’ to make herself look like a real
pantomime boy. The building-up process is a
secret known only to herself and her dresser, said
artless Nellie, and the pressman put it all down in
his little book as though he were recording a great
theatrical achievement. If he took the lady’s
word for it that she looks every inch a boy after
she has substituted a couple of wadding poultices
for a pair of cor-sets— well, the poor man can’t
have a keen eye for curves and protuberances. The
last time Australia looked upon Our Nellie she was
showing a quite feminine figure below the waist,
and we have not heard of her being pared down by
a surgical Shylock who demands rather more than
his pound of flesh. She would need to shrink in
the washing, or be partly cut off in her prime,
before any person of experience could possibly
mistake Nellie for a long-lost little brother.
“ An operatic petticoat-pet, one night, escorted
two superlatively naice grass-widows to a restaur-
ant-supper. His guests evidently belonged to
that ‘ tropical-blossom ’ type, described by a recent
newspaper gusher as common in the garden of
Australian womanhood. Anyway, they disagreed,
threw out nasty insinuations re teeth, com-
plexions, and morals, and wound up by baptising
one another’s front hair with champagne. Their
bone of contention, finding the atmosphere too
sultry for safety, soon left the ladies to fight it
out. ‘ Hamlet ’ without the ghost soon fell flat.
Each disputant hurriedly ordered a hansom and
fled her rival’s neighborhood as if pestilence lurked
therein.
“ After the divorce nisi has been decreed, the
usual thing is for the divided parties to keep care-
fully out of each other’s way. A peculiar in-
cident of the broken-matrimonial-shackle-strong-
in-death turned up the other day. The
mother of a certain professional man died.
On the day of the funeral there arrived at
the house of her mother-in-law-that-had-been
the lovely divorced wife of the bereaved son,
by the hand her little five - year - old
boy. She pushed her way among the mourners
in the drawing-room, and insisted on taking a
share in the mutual grief. Then, to the petrifac-
tion of the family proper, as no seat had been kept
vacant for her in the mourning coaches, she
started off to walk to the cemetery. With the aid
of a black-edged handkerchief she wept louder
than anyone else all through the funeral, and, when
all was over, wiped her eyes, said “ Come along,
Tommy, ” and departed cheerfully, with the air of
one who never would shirk a painful duty.
Y ours affectionately,
GOULI-GOULI.

TO THE EDITOR “AUSTRALASIAN
MEDICAL GAZETTE.’'
Sib, —Some time ago I had brought under my
notice the many recommendations of the ZetzSpa
Mineral Water, and resolved to observe its effect
in certain cases of dyspepsia, with the result that
I am positively convinced that we have at hand a
palliative, if not an absolute remedy, at once
easily obtainable, inexpensive, and last but most
important, decidedly agreeable to take. My
interest led me to ascertain its analysis, and, from
its composition, it naturally commends itself in
cases where the gouty diathesis is evidenced, as
well as in the different kidney-bladder-liver trou-
bles ; but what I desire to particularly emphasise
is its really almost magical effect in those cases of
dyspepsia associated with hypochondria. There
seems to be an instant change in the manner of
the patient—a feeling of buoyancy, almost, which
surely continues, and, most remarkable of all,
food which could not be tolerated, no matter how
prepared, is taken with relish, and there
are absolutely no subsequent symptoms or
signs of discomfort. Just how or why this
particular mineral water produces such marked
results I confess my comparative failure to fathom,
but I tend to the idea that there is an undiscovered
or intangible something, possibly just such a
happy and perfect combination of the various
salts which cause this desirable consummation.
This opinion is somewhat strengthened by the
want of any extreme disparity between the con-
stituents of this mineral waters and of some
others, which latter, however, do not exhibit any-
thing approaching the power of Zetz Spa. I have
learnt that the source of this mineral water is near
Dubbo, N.S.W., and that already a depdt has
been formed in Sydney so as to allow of its distri-
bution to the public; and, in conclusion, I need
but state that I will look with interest to its trial
in similar cases to those I have mentioned, and
feel sure that most gratifying results will be the
outcome of its exhibition.
Yours faithfully,

Sydney M.P. Colonel Atkinson Price, a
small warrior with a habit of approaching the
most trivial subject in a deep and solemn manner,
recently grew alarmed on the subject of “ ticks,”
and asked the Minister, in a frightened voice, as
though millions of ticks were waiting outside for
him : “If he was aware that the Queensland ticks
had got over into N.S. Wales and were within 100
miles of the Richmond River.” “ Good heavens ! ”
interjected a startled river member, “ have they
got electors’ rights?”

Premier Kingston is a persistent letter-
writer to the papers dui, eg election campaigns.
He recognises (wl.at newspaper writers don’t like
to) that pithy letters are the most-read part of the
average paper. Besides, slashing speaker though
he is, he is a better draftsman still ; and he
likes to be responsible for the way his replies are
put. He never forgets the iaw-office injunction,
“Number your paragraphs,” and that is an aid to
terseness.
Throssell, W.A. Lands Minister, is very-
deaf, and carries an ear-trumpet. An M.P. who
wanted to get a friend of his a billet, took him
into the Minister’s room. “Speak loud,” said
the M.P. to his protege, “the old is very
deaf.” Unfortunately the M.L.A. did not notice
that as he entered Throssell had placed his sound-
receiver in position, and before the other could
say a word the Minister himself remarked —
“ Speak loud ! the old is very deaf.”
John Dennistoun Wood, the Melbourne

Daily-newspaper controversialists who as-
sail one another with epithets of vitriolic scorn are
an infliction of the Federal season, but those who
butter one another with cartwheel grease (vide
O’Sullivan : “The rapier thrusts of my friend Mr.

tainment.
William Spicer, leader of the Lambing
Flat rioters of nearly 40 years ago, visited Sydney
last week and re-told many old stories of the
fight between 15,000 European and 5000 Chinese
miners. Spicer did 14 months in gaol for his ex-
ploits, but all the time the diggers kept his claim
for him. Like other rebels, he became afterwards
an official under Govt., but retired years ago.
The emerging of ex-Premier Shiels is to be
one of the features of next session of Vic. Parlia-
ment. Since the collapse of his Government,
Shiels has sulked in his tent, under cover of a
heart-trouble. But now he is said to be in much
more robust health, and to have already learnt by
heart half-a-dozen impromptu speeches on as many
subjects. People have been in the habit of looking
upon Shiels as politically dead, but his personal
friends say he has kicks in him yet.
A pillar of the Anglican Church, who was
a strong political opponent of Parkes, convulsed
his congregation in his sermon preached on the
Sunday following the death of that eminent
politician. It so happened that a local resident,
a good friend of the church and a man of weight
in the vestry, had died in the same week. The
incumbent thus prefaced a sermon on the decease
of the twain : “Brethren, there have passed away
from us this week two men known to us all, one a
faithful and a zealous worker in the vineyard who
is now receiving his reward, and the other, a great
statesman and politician who has gone to his
account !”
Australian artist Arthur Streeton, accent-

JACK ASHORE.
SAILOR : “Say, boss, got any
’orses to let out on ’ire?”
OSTLER : “ Yes; what kind do
you want?”
SAILOR: “ Well, I'd like a
fast, schooner-rigged animal
that steers well an’ can beat
agin ’ a ’cad wind — an’ see that ’e’s well-pro.
visioned an’ doesn’t drift too much when 'e’s
'ove tc.”
Old “Jack” Robertson first signalised
himself in N.S.W. Assembly by taking a stubborn
stand against interfering in Imperial affairs. The
Donaldsons of the time, like the Daileys, Stuarts
and Seddons of later years, loved to be coupled
with England in war and peace —in the Soudan,
Samoa or elsewhere. Premier Donaldson moved
an address of congratulation to the Imperial
Govt, for the then-just-signed Treaty of Paris.
That address “Jack” fought against, but was
beaten by 36 to 4.
“Granny” Sutton, burnt to death at Scone
(N.S.W.), the other day, enjoyed the doubtful
honor of being the first to introduce the prickly-
pear to that region. Between 60 and 70 years ago
she took with her to Scone district a flower-pot con-
taining a prickly-pear plant, and nursed the pest
with such care that she was soon able to supply
her neighbors with settings. The thousands of
pounds sterling it has cost local pastoralists to
eradicate the plant never appeared to diminish her
satisfaction in having been its nurse. Apart from
this, she ranked as the kindliest of old souls, and
had many interesting anecdotes to tell of the
desperadoes known as the Jew Boy gang.
An Australian scribe to The Bulletin
from London anent publishers : “The Book-
fellow says several authors are coming here
from yonder. Let ’em all come if you can
squeeze in one honest publisher among
them. They “do” the author here so bare-
facedly that you must have a beard to front
them even. Collusion with the printers, binders,
and advertising-agents renders examination of
their books (accounts) unsatisfactory to the writer
waiting for royalties. As for the Australian
writer who sends his MS. to London publishers
direct, well, he’s twin brother to the cockney who
sends his Sovs. to Ikey Gizzard, The Golden Dook,
to invest at his (I.G’s.) discretion. More anon.”
Drake, M.L.A. (Q.), was once driving
through a portion of his electorate. The night
was dark, and a gate was encountered which
necessitated getting down to lead the horse
through. Suddenly a masked man hurled a
missile at the politician’s head, which knocked
him senseless. On recovering he drove to the
nearest township and lost no time in informing
the police, whom he took to the scene of the assault.
After thorough search a dead duck was discovered
minus a few feathers, some of which were subse-
quently found clinging to Drake’s back hair.
Further pursuit of the assailant was abandoned
and the would-be assassin escaped.
Mr. and Mrs. Slattery, ex-priest and “es-
caped nun,” now in Melbourne, seem bent on
doing their worst to set the Yellow Pup barking
hereabouts, and the outbreak of anti-High Church
sentiment in Hingland has unexpectedly provided
the Slatterys with a shadow of excuse for their
particular method of living by “religion.” (Slat-
terys, it is evident, “run in all shapes.”) The
lady lectures, not, as has been alleged, in nun’s
attire, but in quiet and tasteful everyday cos-
tume ; nor does she profess to have left her con-
vent under “ spicy ” circumstances. Both which
circumstances are regrettable from a commercial
point of view, because, if Mrs. S. were to appear
in conventual w r eeds, and Mr. S. in full canonicals,
the boom of their “business” would be simply
screeching. As it is, however, the lady has no-
thing more thrilling to relate than that the con-
vent discipline was always hard and sometimes
cruel, that she was particularly unfortunate in her
taskmistresses, and that therefore the life so lost
its spiritual attraction that she communicated
with a Protestant cousin, who, being a baronet’s
wife and a person of some importance, came to
the convent and took her willing relative away.
Sister Mary Elizabeth (now Mrs. Slattery) re-
mained, however, a strict, albeit an unhappy
Catholic until in America she dropped across
Henry Ward Beecher, and was converted to Pro-
testantism ; afterwards dropping across ex-priest
Slattery and being further converted to Orangeism,
to which, more than to ordinary theological Pro-
testantism, are addressed Slattery’s aggressive
deliverances (appropriately announced upon flam-
ing yellow handbills). His wife’s bitterness
appears to be less against the Ould Church, as
a whole, than against the particular establish-
ment which provided her with more hustle and
less holiness than she had expected.
Announcement of a send-off benefit in
Melbourne for Mrs. Marcus Clarke reminds The
Bulletin of sundry paragraphs to the effect that
Lord Rosebery had lately “adopted” one of
her boys. The origin of the yarn dates
back to the time—the sum-
mer of J Bs—when Lord Rose-
bery and his amiable wife
were in Melbourne. He
then presented Mrs. Marcus
with a cheque for .£lOO (she
had previously presented
him with an interesting
manuscript souvenir of her hus-
band), and made her an offer to
educate her eldest son at ’Ome.
This offer Mrs. Clarke refused,
being loth to lose sight of the
boy, and thinking that the prof-
fered favor would not be quite fair
to her other children. The
foundation for the “ adoption ”
yarn began and ended in that
incident. A while ago
Marcus Clarke’s second
son, who is a ship’s-
purser, called upon
Lord Rosebery in Lon-
don, but the polite
peer merely advised
him to get back to Aus-
tralia and study short-
hand.
“ Simon ” : Once
wrote review of a globe-
trotter’s book in a weekly
(Mi-lb.) paper. Globe-
trotter was pushing his
whisky all over the
world. James Service
and Co. were Melb.
agents. Sent for this
scribe and said nice
things about the
screed. “You like
the whisky?” said
Service, interroga-
tively. Scribe said
he hadn’t tasted it.
“Then you write
about things you
know nothing of ? ” “ Prefer-
ably,” was the answer; “ gives
you more room.” “Humph!”
said Service, stroking his beard
in a meditative way, “ journal-
ism should be a good school for a politician.”
“ No, no,” quoth the writer, “ there is a limit to
the value of ignorance.” And Jimmy laughed
and sent a case of the whisky to writer’s habita-
tion, wherein there was much joy as long as there
was a cork to draw. Service was a kind-hearted
chiel, with a dry wit of his own, something like
that of N.S.W.’s Dr. M'Laurin and the sawdust
in their native haggis.
The revived Roman triumvirate didn’t last
long in Tasmania. Philip Fysh having gone to
London as Agent-General, and Braddon taken
his billet and screw as Treasurer, there were left
but three Ministers, and as the Cascade Brewery
is all-powerful in the Hobart State, it was curious
that the initials of the new triumvirate should
spell “Pub”—Pillinger, Urquhart, Braddon.
If they had lasted they might have been known
in history as the “Pub. Ministry.” But poor
Pillinger died of heart-dropsy last Saturday, and
the Pub. Ministry is left without its initial letter.
Dear Bulletin. —Restatement (B. 22/4/’99)
that one Jas. Faunt, of Cootamundra, N.S.W.,
claims to have the largest number of living
descendants of any one in Australia. If the num-
ber given, 64 grandchildren, and 29 great-grand-
children, be correct, he simply isn’t in it with
John Eaton, a well-known squatter in the Wide
Bay District, Q. He also is 89 years old, and has
77 g-children, 105g-g-children,and3g-g-g-children.
Mr. Eaton is a Hawkesbury, N.S.W., native,
actively manages his cattle station, and may
possibly live to see another 10 or 12 additions
to his host of descendants.

“Gr.S.T.” to The Bulletin on “The
Science of Drafting'.” :
The hospitable squatter has sometimes a hard row to
hoe in dealing with people who turn up casually as
visitors. There is the “ insider,” whom he welcomes with
hearty greeting, and who, if he is not an old friend, is
sure to be known by name, and is very soon made to feel
like one. Then the “ outsider” is equally sure of kindly
welcome. Say Brown’s man has been sent over to
collect their stragglers at the morrow’s mustering. He
is shown where to put his horse, bidden “ get a feed ” in
the kitchen, and passes a happy evening trying to
out-brag the men in the hut. But there are
0 * e u?- . n °k 80 eas y to place. When the squatter’s
establishment boasts no “ bachelor's quarters, ** where is
tailor’s cheeky drummer with his scented
red-silk handkerchief, greasy hair, confident leer, and
h-less vocabulary ? Will he bring 1 him in to say, “ ’Ow
har yer ? ” to the missis, and inform her that he is “ Doin’
u 6 i " " ft t, also, is to be done with the unwashed
sheep-buyer, who can do nothing but gaze at his dusty
boots and say “Yes, missis ; no, missis” ? Once saw a
big difficulty of this kind cleverly smoothed-out. It was
in the old days, when bushmen had time nowand then for
a bit of fun, and did not spend week-in, week-out grinding
jumbucks into cash. They had a monster kangaroo-drive
at Tiley’s, all the neighboring stations and selections
being represented—masters and men, jackaroos, boun-
dary-riders, and all ; and when, after return to the
station in the evening, we were standing around in
groups discussing the day’s sport, I saw old Tiley doubt-
fully eyeing the crowd, and wondered how he would deal
with the sorting difficulty. At last the old chap cleared
his throat and called out, “ Well, gentlemen, we’ll get
some tea. There’s the hut; there are the bachelors’
quarters ; and there’s the house—draft yourselves ! ” And
every man of them sorted himself to a T.

“ Imray ” on the perils of Darling navi-
gation :
Boarded the Mary Anne Jane at Port Pooncarie, Darling
River. She had just been on the slips of that important
city for repairs, and the entire goat population was out
to see us start up-stream. The M.A.J. was a paddle-
steamer of two tons register, rounded off like a cask at
each end, the better to relieve concussion. Her bottom
was flat and pram-dished for’ard. She was fitted (the
chief engineer said) with triple-expansion, self-lubri-
cating, lightning-revolving double-back-action compound
engines, jewelled in four holes or something, but they
appeared to be mostly poulticed up with fencing-wire
and rags. After various erratic evolutions, the part
that most looked like the nose was pointed up-stream,
and we tore round the bend at fully I}4 n iles an
hour. Just here the paddle-wheels got tangled in a
cod-line, which was, however, cleared in less than
an hour. About dinner-time we tied up to a tree,
as the crew said it could not boil the billy and run the
ship too. Towards sundown the man at the wheel called
to the crew (an old dead-beat who was getting a free
passage) to know what that was ahead, and the crew
(standing well for’ard with a life-belt) reported : “There
ain’t no reef ’ere. It’s a cob o’ coal as ain’t marked on
the chart.” About a mile higher up we found a log fallen
right across the stream, and the utility of the dish in the
boat’s nose now became apparent. Cargo and passengers
were shifted aft, thus raising the steamer’s nose 3ft. in
the air ; and .the engines being wound up to a frantic
pressure, she rose to the obstruction, and glided over
till she got balanced amidships. Passengers and weight
then shifted for’ard, thereby raising her stern and gliding
her head-first into deep water. Took passage next day in
a bullock-dray—l was in a hurry !

A. bushman was missed on the Upper
Tambo some weeks ago. Search was made, and
his corpse was found under a fallen tree. A burn-
ing trunk had dropped on the poor fellow during
his sleep and pinned him to the ground. Investi-
gation showed that he had lived some time after
the fall, and that the fire had crept along the tree
until it had reached and burnt him. A not un-
common horror in the bush.
Re Germans consulting their three-
pence-a-week lodge-doctor on the diseases
of fowls, &c. A Q. police-magistrate, when
first appointed to an out-back town, took
up a, selection some miles therefrom, built
a big house, and started in to become a
cultivator of the soil. It cost him some
.£4OO to get five acres cleared and ploughed,
and then he was not quite sure whether
to put in pumpkin-trees or what, and went
round inquiring the best times to plant
everything in general. One day he was
trying a case in which the local butcher
sued a publican for damages, sustained by
reason of the beer-person’s fowls having
feloniously entered his shop and roosted on
his meat, and disrespectfully dragged his
sausages round on the dirt-floor by the
hair ; and as the court-house only possessed
a table and chair for the Solon, and some-
thing-resembling a piano-box-on-end for the
witness, occupied just then by Bung, the
butcher was standing beside the table.
Disregarding the witness, who was uphold-
ing the virtue of his fowls in impassioned
language, the P.M. leant over and
whispered, “When is the best time to
plant potatoes ? ” The meat-purveyor re-
plied, “ Now,” and the adjudicator turned
round, cut off the stream of the publican’s
eloquence at the tap, rapped out “ damages,
£3 and costs of court,” shot out of the
temple of justice, and ten minutes later
was driving out of town at a hand-gallop,
with a bag of seed potatoes strapped to the
back of his trap.

“ C.S.” : Re (B. 25/3/’99) prickly
pear a blessing in disguise. Years ago told
you what is a fact, that leaves can be
utilised for cattle-feed by the simple pro-
cess of squashing them. Also, the addi-
tion of prickly pear-leaf boiled improves
whitewash. Further, the distillation of
prickly pear-leaves gives a remarkably fine
spirit, akin to the metzl of Mexico.

“ Silly Billy re “ Tinlip” on dog-
poisoning (Bulletin, 15/4/’99)
I have frequently seen oil-treatment tried, as often fail-
ing- as curing. If given before convulsions, almost sure
cure ; but after they start, doubtful. Last dog I treated
had two convulsions; oil applied, no effect. Have often
seen dogs cured if oil given at once after bait taken. I
suppose the rationale is that oil acts emetically. There
are as many so-called cures as kinds of dogs. Knew one
dog, on selection here, poisoned five times and cured •
each time by cutting off slice of tail and ear. Sixth time,
no tail nor ear left to cut, so dog died. Don’t know why
this cure acts—perhaps “Tinlip” does. Other cures:
dry salt, hot water, hanging up by tail, &c. ; but, as a
Chinaman here says, “ Suppose too muchee jump, he
can’t makee cure.” Another strychnine problem : Dog
in strong convulsions, whip cracked loudly, or rifle-shot
alongside, and he will die at once.

“Bunt”: Rather disgusting to learn
that the “Australian bul-hul ” is only saulo-
procta, after all. When a small boy, used to
“knock” sauloprocta with a shanghai. Un-
suspecting black-and-white bird that was always
fooling about the cows, and would wiggle a long
black tail and cry “ Sweet pretty cree-chur.” We
called him a “ willy-wagtail,” and I reckon that’s
what he is.
For real mateship, go into some outlying
mining camps. Way back from Murchison, lately,
a party of three came up from a dripping-wet
shaft, in the VVestralian Mt. Morgan, at the mid-
night change. They had fired two holes, and the
fuses had missed ; it was their place to go back
after a half-hour’s pause, and see what was wrong.
But with a “You chaps are shivering; g£t on
home, and we’ll fix it,” the new shift of three
went down, must have struck one of the charges,
and were blown to pieces. Then it was left for
other mates to gather up the limbs, and make the
coffins, and dig the graves, and read the service,
and, hardest of all, write the letters “ home.”

Long ago, in the bad old days, a N.S.W.
squatter sacked his housekeeper and her husband.
The pair journeyed to town and laid an informa-
tion against their former employer charging him
with the murder of a black. Squatter was
arrested on his way to town, charged, and
admitted to bail. Same night two of his bosom
pals set out on horseback for the station. Arrived
there they disinterred some bones from a two-
year-old grave and replaced them with the skele-
ton of a kangaroo. They were just in time, for
the police were on the scene soon after they left.
When the case came on there was no corrobora-
tive evidence, and accused was discharged “ with-
out a stain,” &c. But it was a narrow escape.

Told ot a good old absent-minded parson,
well-known along a N.S.W. river, that, on one
occasion, he stopped the night at a certain
station, intending next day to preach at a place 15
miles distant. He duly started in the morning,
and placidly drove and drove about the plain
until, striking a house towards sundown, he in-
quired of a boy how far it was to his destination.
The boy nearly died of laughing, for the good,
easy man was back at the place he had left eight
hours before. Another time, driving near the
Murray, in his usual state of lostness, he saw a
light in the distance, and headed for it straight,
over everything that came in his way, but, when
daylight arrived, discovered that he had been fol-
lowing a steamboat down the river all night.

“ H.E.R.” : As a marauder of camp stores
the bandicoot is hard to beat. On Callide Ranges,
Q., built a small log hut to protect stores, and
bagged a Thomas cat 90 miles on horseback as a
garrison against bush-rats. Cut a swing-flap in
door for use of cat, but first night bandicoots
trooped in and gorged half the flour and all the
dried apples. Worked the cat through same
opening for a week, and then he did not drop to
it. Have seen a bandicoot lift the lid off a billy
and drink contents —bandicoot soup —in the
moonlight. Encouraged a big goanna to stay
about as camp scavenger, which he did, driving
off all competitive brethren, but the cat became
too confidential, and the goanna took him in.
Then the goanna became too confidential, espe-
cially at meal-time, and, failing to keep him out
of the curry, I slew him with the fire-shovel.

Dear Bulletin.— Re “ Roley P.’s” statement (B.
15/4/’99) about porcupine carrying oil apples on his
spines and eating them—the echidna (or so-called Aus-
tralian porcupine) couldn’t eat fruit if it tried, because
it isn’t built that way. It feeds by inserting its long
cylindrical tongue into ants’ nests, and when the ants
have attached themselves to it, drawing it back into its
mouth. Will also root down into the ants’ nest and
eat the eggs as well. The animal, therefore, being
strictly insectivorous, “ Roley P.’s’.’ statement is calcu-
lated only to mislead readers anxious for the truths of
natural history— not for “ funny yarns.”
WITCHERY
FOR THE BULLETIN.
Rich bay with a star on the face
And white on the off hind-foot,
With a beautiful temper and plenty of pace,
And keen as a hawk to boot,
With a shoulder as clean as a stag’s,
And loins that would carry a ton,
There’s nothing so kindly goes down to the flags
As Witchery—fourteen-one !
She’s a wonder at getting away,
And, give her a length on the grass,
They can bid a good-day to the swift little bay,
For there’s nothing can catch her or pass ;
She fights for her head to the ball,
For the ponies are fond of the fun,
And, oh ! but she loves to be leading them all,
Does Witchery—fourteen-one !
Do I touch her at times with the spur ?
It is little my beauty will care,
And the blood on her mouth doesnot matter to her—•
She has plenty of “ blood,” and to spare !
And the ladies will pet her and praise
When the last merry quarter is done,
And she likes it—l don’t care what anyone says—
Does Witchery— fourteen-one!
A barbarous sport ? Well, I yield !
But if this be a crime, let us sin ;
For the goal flagsareflying, the crowd’s on the field,
And the ponies are mad to begin.
Savages? Yes, if you like !
But the musical mallet’s begun
And she’s biting the bit to get down for a strike
Is Witchery—fourteen-one !
Girth up, and ride out to the fray !
For our foemen in crimson and white,
They are demons to play and they mean it to-day :
We shall have to hit hard and sit tight.
And we’ve got to take risks of our own
When the coin has been spoken and spun,
And the hard knocks, remember, are not all alone
For Witchery—fourteen-one !

Maoriland has always been more advanced
than any of the Australian provinces in its fond-
ness for D.C.L. whisky, says the much-travelled
representative of the Distillers’ Co. Ltd., who
reckons that the brand which Dunedin has de-
lighted to honor should need no further recom-
mendation to the Scotch whisky-drinkers of this
thirsty continent. During his recent visit to the
North and South islands, the gentleman aforesaid
found Scotchmen everywhere, and the D.C.L.
black bottle in universal demand. That’s how he
explains the good government and prosperity of
Maoriland. The local intellect gets strength and
energy from the Whisky of the Wise. Man is
what he drinks.*

“Locust” picks a new Speaker for N.S.
Wales Assembly
Dear Bulletin. — Following at a humble distance a
device of the Duke of Wellington, I beg to submit three
names fortheN.S.W. Speakership on the retirement of
the present Speaker, and leave the choice to you. The
names are as follows :—(1) William Patrick Crick ; (2)
W. P. Crick, M.L.A. ; (3) Billy Crick. Leaving out of
reckoning all the social flam (of which there has been
little in Abbott’s time), what is mainly required of a
Speaker is—(lst) knowledge of the procedure, rules, and
precedents of the House ; (2nd) rapidity of decision com-
bined with decent accuracy born of knowledge ; (3rd)
“ don’t-care-a-damn-ness ” as to individuals or parties in
the discharge of the Speaker’s duties. Besides Crick,
who else is there ? Wise ? A good choice, but he won’t take
it. Lyne ? —Copeland ; they both have many good quali-
ties, but certainly not those which make good Speakers.
Ashton? Not experience enough. Now, Crick
was an old Parliamentary hand from his first entrance
into the House. He’s a lawyer—an advantage this time,
anyhow. He has learned the rules of the House by
breaking them for the benefit of his own party, and
smashing up those who broke them for the other parties.
He is quick as lightning—remember his point when
Willis was shut out of bar on division recently, when
Crick, drawing the Acting-Speaker’s attention to the fact
that the question had not been read, struck up the bars,
broke the division, and let in another vote to his side. As
to being fearless—well, politically, at any rate, he is.
And, with all his brusquerie, Crick is liked in the House
on all three sides for many things done by his right hand
without the knowledge of his left.
The Commercial World (London) writes re-
garding the Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society :
“ We always confidently anticipate a good year from this
vigorously-conducted Mutual Society. The circumstance,
therefore, that the figures for 1897 show no falling away
from the steady and substantial progress which is inse-
parably connected with the Society’s past career occasions
us no surprise. As a matter of fact, the Society earns its
success by deserving it, and, that much being conceded,
the best possible has been said for the continuance of the
large measure of public support which it has hitherto
fallen to its fortunate lot to receive.” Pleasant reading.*

Maoriland and Wonderland are, of course,
quite synonymous terms; and of all wondrous
parts of a magnificently wonderful country there
are, perhaps, few more wonderful than the ther-
mal springs district. The special attraction is
the romance that clings about it. When one, in
the ordinary, necessary course of nature, can lave
himself in baths of fame immemorial with such
names as “Priest” and “Rachel,” lie is more
than repaid the small amount of passage-
money necessary to waft him to Maoriland.

•‘H.C.C.” : The “ swag-
gies ” who growl at cocky’s
want of hospitality are hard
to please. A fair specimen
called at our selection one
day for the inevitable “bit o
meat.” We hadn’t a scrap in
the harness-cask, so told the
hired boy to give him a tin of
salmon, which was received
with disgusted surprise :
“ What —no meat! What the
do yous coves live on up
this creek? The cove lower
down hadn’t no meat neither
—nothink but a tin o’ sar-
dines an’ some eggs to gim-
me?” “Well, it’s your own
fault,” said the boy (recent
importation from London) ;
“you oughter sent a wire to
the boss, sayin’ you was a-
eomin,’ and then he’d ’a’
chanced the meat goin’ bad,
ratherthan disapp’irit a travel-
lin’ dook 1 Give us yer card
an’ I’ll take it in on the
toastin’-fork.” The “dook”
changed his tone. “No kid,
now— ain't there a bit o’ salt
meat in the cask ? ” “No,
there ain’t. Just go’n eat wot
you’ve got, and fancy it’s
Good Friday.” “Weil, are
there any more cockies up the
creek?” “Yus, there’s one
abaht five miles up.” “Chance
of getting anythink there?”
asked swag g i e, anxiously.
“ Yus ; you put on that fancy

and civil, like you did to me, and they might give
you a tin-opener and some vinegar. Ta-ta.”

T.R. : Quintan, the cobbler, athirst but
“ stiff,” sought credit in Sandy Dean’s bar, but
Sandy wasn’t on. “ But if ye like tae haulf-sole
a pair o’ shoes o’ mine,” he said, “I’ll gie ye
haulf-a-croon.” Never was Quinlan known to
finish a job so quickly, and Sandy paid up, count-
ing on having the money back again before long—
“ I’ll hae it a’ back a gen gin he says ‘Jock
Robertson,’” he thought. Then he took the
shoes to the girl to be cleaned, but at the first
rub off came one of the soles. It was a piece of
saddle-flap. Quinlan had taken Sandy’s saddle,
cut soles out of the flaps and glued them on.
Wolves—or Not Wolves?
Sydney Daily Telegraph, leading article, 19th April,
98: “They [the Victorians] have but one article in their
political creed. It is the plunder'of N.S.W. .. . The
common instinct of ‘ loot’ has knitted together a formid-
able majority for the Bill in Victoria.”
Daily Telegraph, leading article, 17th April, ’99 : “ Mr.
Wise . . . stated that, in its leading columns, the D.T.
had assailed the character and morality of the people of
Viotoria, describing our neighbors as wolves and thieves,
that were only actuated by a desire to loot the Treasury
of N.S.W. . .'. No such epithets have ever been applied
(in our leading columns) to the people of Victoria. Neither
have we made any assault upon the character or morality
of our intercolonial neighbors. . . . It is indeed time that
these silly references to the character and morality of the
people of the different colonies were eliminated from the
question of Federation altogether.”
Daily Telegraph, leading article, 3rd May, ’99 : “We
have not yet done with the ‘wolves and robbers’ argu-
ment. The Billites have much to say about it, not liking
it. But all they have hitherto said against it has not re-
moved it. . . . They, and all the rest of the ‘ necessitous ’
(their own word), are being whitewashed daily by Messrs.
Reid, Barton, Wise and Co., who say they are moral and
respectable, not in anything wolfish. But, in spite of it
all, their intention remains public and unholy. We will
not give it any name of animal or human criminal. The
dictionaries are at the disposal of the Billites.”
THE GIDDY WRECK.
“I believe, Professor, that elderly Miss Giddy is setting her cap
at you.”
“Ach zo? Veil, if she rears her cap on her face she will haf a
shance!”
“ Mary, pity women ! " A S.A. German
farmer’s daughter, returning to her home after 12
months’ service on a station, hid her condition
from her parents, even when her hour came. In
despair, she wandered out into the scrub, hatless,
though it was midsummer, and there became a
mother. Whether she killed the child or not she
doesn’t know ; she believes she did. Anyhow,
finding it dead, she began to dig a grave with her
fingers. It was only a mite ; but the ground was
cruel hard, and her strength gave out; so she
dragged herself to a rabbit’s hole, and made that
serve. Mother, father, and brother gave edi-
dence against her ; but the Ghief-J ustice refused
to send the case to the jury as one of murder, and
the jury refused to convict on the lesser count.
The still-distracted girl left the dock. She stag-
gered ; her relatives were there, but they stood
aside, and a policeman had to help her to a place
among the curious crowd at the back !
Our apology to neighbors has been sadly miscon-
strued ;
You mustn’t think them honest, just because we
won’t be rude.
We wouldn’t say they’re “ wolves and thieves ”
that might be rather hot;
But don’t misunderstand us— we have never said
they're not.
There is a beast, a noisome beast that’s wont to
howl and bite;
We wouldn’t name him—not for worlds ; it
wouldn’t be polite.
And do we say our neighbors are such creatures,
grim and gaunt ?
Why, no—we do not say so ; but— it’s not because
we can’t.
Some men annex what isn’t theirs —or so, at least,
we’ve heard ;
They’re called—well, “ Webster’s Unabridged ”
supplies the missing word.
The name we never use ourselves —it might create
a scene;
But look across the border — and you’ll sec the folk
we mean.
We hope you understand us, for we’ve tried to
make it clear ;
We “ mistrust other colonies, ” and mean to per-
severe.
So here’s our manifesto, which we won’t abate one
jot :
To call them “wolves” is silly— but to call them
honest , rot 1
GAMMA.
At Poverty Point.
Bellew joins Irving’s co. at London Lyceum. Kyrle,
with a touoh or two of grease-paint, might be Irving’s
dead or living image—perhaps on a rather smaller scale.
Writer once saw Kyrle transform himself in two seconds,
with a couple of coloring touches and a twist of the
body, into an exact reproduction of Irving as photos,
have made him known in Australia.
Wilson Barrett is likely to achieve his heart’s desire
this year. Irving’s lien on the Lyceum will be restricted,
under the new limited co. arrangement, to 100 nights per
annum, leaving 213 nights available for the production of
all sorts of plays and “ stars.” AndW.B.,itis said, will
be given a season at London’s “ representative ” theatre
during one of Irving’s absences. Thus far the bull-necked
showman has not tried his luck at any of the highest-
priced houses. All the money he made in London was
made at the unfashionable Princess’s, where also he
dropped his profits when he gave them Shakespeare.
The Boot-Trunk Tragedy and the Gatton Horror have
been godsends to the travelling wax-works men. Phil
Stuart when last heard from was doing quite a big busi-
ness with a waxen Mabel and three gruesome Murphy
effigies as chief items in his variety show.
“ H.C.R.” : When, some time ago, the writer was tour-
ing the Northern line with a waxworks’ show, at one
town a well-to-do squatter of pugilistic and hilarious
tendencies paid his shilling for admission. Entering the
chamber of horrors he asked the lecturer where the figure
of Deeming was. It was pointed out to him. He walked
over to it, and, looking long and fiercely at the image,
dressed in bloodstained shirt and trousers, holding a huge
knife in its hand, he suddenly raised his riding-crop, and
yelling “You villain!” proceeded to demolish the
stolid staring figure. He was arrested, and next morning
paid the proprietor of the show £so—the value put upon
the destroyed image. Some time after he made a fierce
assault on a policeman, and was sent for trial, but
acquitted. This may show the difference in value
between a dummy murderer and a real live limb of the
law.
Said that an old woman from Tasmania, sauntering
through the chamber of horrors at Melb. Waxworks, re-
cognised the figure of a hanged murderer (Geo. Chamber-
lain) as that of her long-lost son. Up to then, the poor
old girl had been hoping that her offspring would turn
up at any time with an affectionate greeting and a big
bag of money for mother.
News of the death of Alma Grey’s mother reminds
many Melbournians that they had almost forgotten a one-
time popular dancer. There were two charming Sisters
Grey—Jessie and Ruth—in the old days, and Ruth, who
married Alf. Boothman, became the authoress of Little
Alma Grey. From her mother the precocious child got a
natural talent for dancing and the tuition which turned it
into money. Mrs. B. took Alma to London some 18
months ago and procured engagements for her, so the
mitherless bairn is not likely to go friendless.
Cissie Loftus has obtained a ’Murkan divorce from
hubby Justin M‘Carthy the younger, but she admits
that they are still on friendly terms. If she marries
another fellow M'Carthy will probably send her a
wedding-present, for the cable lately told us of a
’Murkan divorc6 contributing 100,000dol. to his ex-
wife’s new happiness. Cissie’s action is calculated
to satisfy a number of Hinglish high-toners who held up
their hands in horror when the clever young Irishman
carried her off five years ago. Also, her parents will
chuckle, perhaps. At the time of Cissie’s “abduction”
she was a legal infant, earning a handsome income at the
music-halls, and her natural guardians—Marie Loftus and
big Ben Brown—strongly objected to the girl being
snapped up for matrimonial purposes.
SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE.
SHEPHERD : “ My dear man, if I gave you a penny
it would only be providing the means for you
to steep yourself in the cursed drink.”
SUPPLICANT : “ Look ’ere, mister, if yer puts me on
to the place YOU gets boosed at for THAT price”
(confidentially), "I don’t mind givin ’ yer a
tanner for yerself.”
Girard, the long, lanky, invalid humorist of the Belle of
New York Co., has a “ plain-clothes” face which should
be a joy forever to the caricaturist. To look at him is to
feel more than ever convinced that facial expression
amounts to nine points of a comedian.
“ S.” : When theatrical managers put up Oscar Wilde’s
plays they nowadays suppress the author’s name in the
playbills and advts. They have been condemned for
doing this—in Tub Bulletin as elsewhere—on the ground
that if they are not ashamed to make money out of the
author’s work, they should give him credit for it. But
observe : Wilde seems ashamed of his own name now.
He has just published his comedy, “ The Importance of
Being Earnest.” The title page gives it as “by the
author of ‘Lady Windermere’s Fan.’” Wilde’s name
does not appear from title page to colophon.
Byron preferred Rev. Dr. Young’s tragedy of “The
Revenge ”to “ Othello.” The rev. gentleman, author of
“Night Thoughts,” was angry with his rival of Avon for
making the black man good, and the white bad. So he
reversed the process. Zanga is a black lago, and Alonzo
the white Othello. Kean produced an overwhelming
effect as Zanga. The play is written in a fine vein of
stage claptrap.
Put George Rignold in a congenial Shakespearian
character, and he at once stands head and shoulders
higher than any other actor in Australia. He would seem
even stronger as lago than as Othello—but an alternation
of parts with fragile Harry Diver is out of the question.
Robustious Gus Glover is said to have been a most effec-
tive Othello in days of yore. Miln was good enough,
though he took more kindly to lago.
Brien England—ex-R.N. lieut., and well-known in Aus-
tralian stage circles—is now in London arranging for
circusman Fillis’s coming summer show of “ Savage South
Africa.” England and Fillis struck it rich in S. Africa,
and expect to do even better at ’Ome.
AT THE STOCKMAN'S REST.
LITTLE WILLIE : “Say, mister. D-dad wants yev
to pay fer yer dinner before y’eat any more.”
JOHNQUIL DE SWAGGARONI: “ That’s all right,
sonny. Tell yer father I'm travellin ’ round
the world f’r a wager of forty thousand. We
don’t pay f’r anything. He’ll understand.”
“ Asmodeus” : In a way-back town, years ago, a band
of bumpkins arranged an entertainment to benefit the
School of Arts. “ Richard III.” (no less) was the chosen
piece, and the local publican allotted himself the name-
part. But the “ supe.” who had to inform the crabbed
monarch of the capture of Buckingham, despite all re-
hearsal, was never quite solid on his one or two lines,
and always tied up in a knot at “ My lord, Buckingham is
taken.” He was coached even until the last moment, and
then he ambled on in a lamentable state of beer and stage-
fright, and said, briefly, “ Me lord, Buckingham is dead.”
“ d my eyes, if I didn’t think so ! ” roared the pub-
lican-monarch, and he wrapped his regal robes around
him and strode off the boards. “ Richard III.” ended
there.
A thought-reading turn was one of the items of the
evening. One of the co.’s principals approached a well-
known athlete, gave him a £1 note and placed him
among the audieijoe. The trick was to guess the number
of this note. When the item was announced said athlete
got up and said to audience, to the professor’s chagrin,
“ If the professor guesses correctly I’ll give this note to
the hospital.” Of course the performer was then forced
to say, “ If I don’t guess it I’ll give a pound to charity.”
So the hospital got a pound either way. But, sad to
state, they took that athlete’s name off the free list.
“ S.” : Is Strong Man Sampson still an object of in-
terest? If so, a hint about his coin-breaking feat.
Handled half of a shilling broken by him ; both edges of
the fracture showed darker than the centre, and had all
the appearance of having been eaten with an acid. The
then centre strip was jagged as if torn.
“Cheek” seems to be common among strong men.

THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian Rems. *
While ploughing land at the foot of the
range, Toowoomba, a farmer lately turned up a
number of watches,, chains, rings, and other
jewellery. It was at first supposed to be the plant
of some robbery, but the watches were all of great
age, and-now it is concluded that they were the
property of white men murdered by blacks. The
blacks were troublesome about the range in the
early days, and early pioneers remember many
disappearances of travellers. For years an escort
of troopers under a lieutenant protected the track
up the main range.
Prospectus of the Golden Belt Bucket-
Dredging Co. (Vic.) appears in this issue. The
property includes about three miles of the Barwid-
gee(Ovensdistrict) Creek-bed, with a width of some
400yds., and the scheme is based on the calculation
that less than half a grain of gold to the lode will
pay working exes. 50,000 shares at 55., of which
25,000 f.p. are “ reserved for the promoters.” This
is tempered by a clause to the effect that all the
promoters’ shares are to remain in the hands of
the co.’s solicitor for three months.

Divorce seems to run in some families.
“Jersey Lily” Langtry’s brother, Clement Le
Breton, lately got a decree nisi against his wife,
on account of her fatal fondness for Lord Grantley.
Respondent seems to have started to be giddy
after 22 years of married life, and she didn’t even
jib at his lordship’s (his lordship is a widower)
proposal that she should take her grown-up
daughter along with her to play propriety when
she went to stay at his quiet little place in the
Highlands. The matron presumably “fell” at
the quiet little place, whilst her daughter was off
duty, for she returned to London in the widower’s
company, and a private detective “ foxed ” the
tender pair with scandalous results. This is
spoken of as an interesting case of deferred adul-
tery on the mother’s part.

The Wolseley Sheep-shearing
Machine Co., Ltd.
The W olseley Company was originally started in
Sydney in 1887, but was floated into a large con-
cern in London in 1889 with a capital of £200,000.
The company have up to the present time fitted
over 450 sheds with an approximate total of 10,000
stands, the number of sheep shorn last shearing
season by Wolseley machines alone in Austra-
lasia being estimated at 25,000,000, while in South
America, the Cape, and other sheep - bearing
countries we are informed equally large and grow-
ing business is being done.
The Wolseley Company are in the unique posi-
tion of being the pioneers, and have held the
supremacy over all other makes of machines dur-
ing the 12 years of their existence. This speaks
volumes for the quality and superiority of their
manufactures.
The company’s standing challenge to all comers
lias been in force for years, but has never yet been
accepted, viz., it will erect an equal number of
stands with any other maker, the loser to pay
the winner’s expenses only. This shows their im-
plicit confidence in their own machine, as with the
reputation it already possesses it has nothing to
gain excepting the increased confidence of the
squatter, and if beaten it would be a great adver-
tisement to its victor.
A notable fact is that shearers purchase for
themselves Wolseley machine shears and sundries,
when proceeding to a machine shed fitted with
those of other makers.
The following are a few records made by shearers
using Wolseley machines, and indicate what a
great advantage they possess over hand shears :
J. Power shore 315 sheep in one day of eight
hours ; Norman shore an average of 200 per day
for over six weeks ; Louis J. Pulley shore over
31,000 in one season. These records were made in
Queensland.
The benefit accruing to the squatter through
using machines is at least a gain of fib. of wool
per sheep, this in stations contiguous to railways ;
while those still further away in the back-blocks
save, it is estimated, at least fib. of wool, owing
to the cut with hand shears there being much
rougher.
The M ‘Caugheys, who shear about 1,000,000
sheep annually, have the following sheds fitted
with Wolseley machines— viz., Dunlop, Toorale,
Goree, Goolgumbla, Rockwood, Barenya, and
North Yanko. Henry Ricketson has the follow-
ing sheds fitted, viz. : —Billabong, Barratta, Ara-
tula, Delatite and Yarronvale. The Osbornes
have fitted Douro, Redbank, Kulki, Curran -
dooley, Orange Plains, Poxlow, Bangaroo, Thorn-
dale and Dirnaseer. Cobb and Co. have fitted
Murrumbidgerie, Burrenbilla, Buckiinguy and
Hereford. These sheds have not been fitted
simultaneously, but one has succeeded another
owing to the satisfactory results obtained at the
initial sheds. At the company’s works in Birming-
ham, which are considered second to none in
equipment of machinery and up to date tools, 350
hands are employed, all parts of the machinery
being made there. In Sydney, the company also
have well-equipped workshops, where repairs to
the machines, &c., can be effected when neces-
sary.
It appears to us that it would be materially to
the advantage of all squatter! to fit up their sheds
with machines, the continued drought having
lessened the number of sheep to such an extent
that every half-pound of wool gained will mean at
least fourpence, as with scarcity of the commodity
its value must be enhanced. For example, a
station shearing, say, 30,000 sheep would gain
IAOOOIb. wool, which at Bd. per lb. would equal
The approximate cost of all necessary machinery,
including engine erected and ready for work,
would be within <£3so, leaving a clear profit of
£‘lso and all machinery paid for on the first shear-
ing. We would strongly advise our squatting
friends to digest the above.
Every inducement is offered by the company’s
agents, Messrs. Dangar, Gedye and Co., who are
willing to supply the shearing machinery on four
months’ credit, thus enabling the grower to have
his wool shorn and sold before being called upon
to Pay for the machinery. As a further instance
?• the gain to squatters it may be mentioned that
in the case of all machine sheds having had the
misfortune to be destroyed by fire, the owners
have in each instance fitted up their new sheds
again with shearing machinery.
Ihe bicycle shown in successful operation at the
recent show (Easter) of the Royal Agricultural
Society of N.S. W., at Sydney, goes to prove that
this company is up-to-date. This was its initial
trial a . n d it is hard to say what the future pos-
sibilities are likely to be for such motive power,
and as the bicycle is fast growing in favor with
shearers in search of employment, it is only
reasonable to suppose that they will have the
patent shearing gear attached to their bicycles.
The gear complete and fitted with sharpening
wheel will weigh in all about 151 b. It is estimated
that one man pedalling will be capable of driving
two shearing machines. This will be of great
benefit to the selectors, and enable them to have
the advantage of shearing by machinery.
The company was awarded first and only prize
at the Sydney Easter show of the Royal Agricul-
tural Society of N.S.W. for their sheep-shearing
machinery 7.
Her Tragedy—And His.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A boundary-rider found him hanging by a strap
from a mulga on the back run. The local paper,
reporting the circumstance, said in stereotyped
phrase : “The desperate man had apparently seen
better days.” It was my lot to overhaul his scanty
belongings. (I’m not a policeman). A page out
of his diary :
* * * *
“I was in an Arcadian forest once. And all the
trees were goodly to look at. One day I felt I
would like to climb one. It seemed so fair. And
in the distance I saw it nodding its head with
pleasure. I walked on, but unconsciously scaled
another. And then came a wonderful peace born
of great joy. But the first tree withered away and
died. And tears rained down that night. They’ve
been falling ever since.”

It was the last page of his diary.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The fact that, Under the Commonwealth
Bill, the N.S.W. Public Service Board will lose
control of the Post-office, Treasury, and Customs,
induces many civil servants to work enthusiasti-
cally for Federation.
Premier Reid should at once appoint an
Attorney-General, if only in justice to Barton,
who is unjustly accused of having the office kept
°P e a for him. The right man to appoint would
be Dr. Cullen, M.L.C. Also, the appointment
would be an expedient one.
Curious to find Dibbs and Lyne and
MacLaurin now declaring, as a reason why
N.S.W. shouldn’t federate, that it is the only
State which is paying its way. And the same
push, when its object was to get Reid out of
office, declared incessantly that N.S.W. wasn’t
paying its way.
At last Referendum nearly all the N.S.
Wales M.’sL.A. were against the Bill, and the
Federalists accused them of looking after Number
One. This year 90 are in favor of it and the anti-
Billites loudly denounce them as “Billet Hunters”
seeking -8700 a year. Even the life of a M.P. has
its little worries.
Anti-Federalists make the word Riverina
cover between a dozen and twenty towns in S.
and S.W. of N.S.W., in the hope thereby of
proving Victorian influence. But the true Riverina
lies between the rivers Murray and Murrumbidgee.
Dr. Lang gave that tract of country the name,
from a similar region called Entre Rios (between
the rivers), which he had passed over in South
America.
The filling
of N.S.W.
Attorney-
Generalship
should af-
ford the
Premier a
chance of re-
vising the
present un-
satisfactory
condition of
M i n isterial
salaries. It
is indecent
for a Pre-
mier to
come down
in the mid-
dl e of a
session with
a request
that the
House
should vote
him a dou-
ceur of £5OO.
The q u eB-
- should
be settled—
apart from
what may
happen af-
ter Federa-
tion. Fos-
ter, in 1860,
carried
through
N.S.W. As-
sam b 1 y a
Bill equalis-
ing all Min-
isterial sala-
ries, and fix-
ing the
amount at
-81500, but
the Leg
Council
threwitout.
If Ministers
cannotcome
to an agree-
inentamong
themselves, Parliament should again take the
matter in hand.
The “Lawyers’ Bill,” the old gibe of last
year, is again revived against the Enabling Bill.
Yet the Bill’s enemies, the motley crowd com-
prising the Cabbage-tree mob, owe practically
everything to four Q.C.’s—Want, Salomons,
Pilcher and Heydon.
In the new S.A. Assembly, Premier King-
ston will probably have a working majority of six
or seven. Though the referendum gave a majority
a J? early 15,000 votes in favor of Household
Suffrage for the Council, it is quite likely that
the new Assembly will have a small majority
against Council reform.
Almost every day now Sydney Telegraph
talks in a perfectly off-hand manner about the
v ederal arrangement for the “ establishment of
the capital in Melbourne. ” And some fools are
actually beginning to believe that there is such a
clause somewhere. Plenty of people will believe
anything if it is only said often enough, with the
casual aspect of one who speaks the truth by
accident.
j e f, will be the death-warrant of
Sydney. J. Want. Just as it was the death-
warrant of New York and Philadelphia, pre-
sumably. Doesn’t everybody know how the lank
and leprous goat now browses in Broadway, and
i 6 K-i ISOn r ? ams oy er Fifth Avenue, and Van-
derbilt can t come out of his wigwam in the
morning without first looking round to see that no
bears are in sight?
Agent-General Salomons recently declared
in London “ that nothing can now prevent the
accomplishment of Federation.” Is this the same
distinguished Geebung who made that violent
attack on Federation—not on the Bill, mind you—
which was printed in pamphlet-form by the “Pru-
dent Federalists ” ? Why this change of opinion ?
Can it be on account of the High Commissioner-
ship of the Commonwealth, which will shortly be
going begging ?
The Sydney Provincial-party was wildly
jubilant over the fact that the Protestant Hall
meeting of Friday evening (4/5/’99) endorsed the
remarks of Dr. M'Laurin and Pilcher, Q.C. But
consider the meeting. At seven o’clock the
ticket-holders ’’—the good, reliable Provinci alists
who had been provided with early-door admittance
u u® Ptovincialist committee—were pouring in
■ u e s '^ e ' en^rance » and when the hall was filled
with selected geebungs the publio was allowed to
enter per front door. About six were able to
accept,the invitation. The gallery was nominally
i?- 6 ’” to was open at 7 p.m., and when the
public rolled up it found that full, too. The or-
ganisers of the show even refused to admit ladies
who had no tickets. Talk about a packed
meeting *
SKETCHES AT THE RECORD ROW MEETING AT SYDNEY
TOWN HALL.
The living cartoon ia a new development
in Australian electioneering. And, of all places !
it was first introduced at S.A.’s Arcadia. The
Bung Association, which King O’Malley mortally
offended, put up its talkiest member—one Taylor
—to guy the King throughout Encounter Bay
district. The King’s grandiloquence lent itself to
rru^P 0011 ’ Taylor did his work cleverly.
Though nominally a candidate, he didn’t seek
votes, but poured all he got into Tucker’s bushel:
and there is little doubt this gave Tucker his
chance and lost the King his seat.
Adelaide ex-Mayor Tucker, who, after
three tries, has now won a seat in S.A. Parliament,
is the man who, as chairman of Adelaide Hospital
Board, pulled the Kingston Govt, through that
terrible trouble. Yet because he found it politic
to adjust his views in order to.beat King O’Malley
at Encounter Bay, the Register claims him as an
Oppositionist. However, when the time comes,
lucker will not be found on the wrong side. Nine
years ago he posed as a Radical at Port Adelaide
and three years ago as a greater Radical still at N.
Adelaide. His political conscience is delightfully
pliant. J {
Happily for the Federal. cause, and for '
Australians, Tom Slattery is agin the Bill and is
doin’ splendid. Sydney Daily Telegraph has
thus no chance of hinting that the battle of the
Boyne will have to be fought out again on Cook’s :
River, and that the Pope is preparing to re-
introduce the Inquisition, auricular confession,
universal celibacy, brass money, and wooden
shoes. The days of the official sectarian’s power
and might are almost over—though Tom’s might
and power in this respect were mainly an ingenious
fiction of the Daily Telegraph for political
purposes.
The “ Secret Conference ” Telegraph
alleges constantly that what it wants is Federa-
tion with the debts and railways pooled. The
Bulletin has always wanted that, but it is pre-
pared to bet its boots that the Telegraph
doesn’t, and that it merely advocates it be-
cause it is the fashion now for the anti-
Federalist to swear that he believes in
Federation only with impossible condi-
tions. Anyhow, the paper which decided
on its present policy at a Secret Confer-
ence of directors is full of one long
wail about the alleged losses ”of
N.S. W. under Federation. And when
it adds that what it wants is to pool
N. S. W. ’s moderately-sol vent rail ways
with the big railway deficits of
Queensland and Tasmania, and to
combine N.S.W.’s debt of .£49 a head
with the £6B of Queensland and the
£67 of S.A., it doesn’t look any too
probable.
According toex-Attorney-Gene-
ral Jack Want, the Federal scheme
will be the “ death-warrant of Syd-
ney.” The Bulletin also resides in
Sydney, and knows the place as well
as J. Want, and its faith is that
Sydney isn’t such a poor, weak, low-
down, crawling place that it can’t hold
its own against Brisbane and Mel-
bourne and Adelaide and Perth and
little Hobart when they all have a
uniform tariff and Freetrade through-
out Australia —i genuine Freetrade, not
the bastard article of the Reid-Want
Government. And, for the credit and
good name of old Sydney, it implores
J. Want to dry up. It doesn’t look
well for a big man like J.W. to be
in such a public funk about the re-
sults of fair and open competition
with other cities especially cities
which he professes to despise so hear-
tily. And, besides, other people are apt to think
that J. Want’s pitiable funk isn’t merely his own
funk, but the funk of N.S.W. in general. Which
ain’t so.
S.A. referendum on the Commonwealth
Bill pure and simple—3s,ooo for, 17,000 against;
on the amended Commonwealth Bill, the other
day—66,ooo for and 17,000 against. Sydney
Daily Telegraph’s comment on this : “ Probably
the former appeal more truly represented public
interest in South Australia on that particular sub-
ject.” Probably ! Now, had 66,000 voted against
the amended Bill, would the Telegraph have dis-
covered such a “probably ” ?
The strangest bedfellows thrown together
by anti-Bill G. Republican Dibbs and the Syd-
ney D.T. They have been sworn foes ever since
the memorable “ deficit ” libel, which very big
misstatement—still hurled with malicious vehem-
ence at Dibbs from time to time —was really no
worse than those circulated now against Federa-
tion. Most people fancied the heavens would fall
ere Dibbs would “ kiss and make friends ” with
the bitterest of his old-time foes.
“Dismal Bill” Rolleston, M.H.R. for
Riccarton (M.L.), has a grievance against the
Seddon Government :
It was against all sound principles that we should be
taking £360,000, as we had last year, from our Consoli-
dated Fund to spend on roads and bridges.
Why, yes, cert’nly ! According to all good Tory
finance all roads and bridges should be paid for
out of loans, and darn the consequences. But
•what a cold day it is for the Opposition when the
best war-cry it can raise is that the Government
doesn’t go into debt fast enough !
M‘Gowen, leader of N.S.W. Labor-party,
says he is in favor of Federation but against the
present Federal scheme because “N.S.W. will
lose its trade.” The only possible loss of trade is
because the other provinces will abolish their
border tariffs and let N.S.W. trade go wherever
it wants to—will give Freetrade to N.S.W., which
is the policy that alleged Freetrader M'Gowen has
always been asking for. Will the blessed M‘G.
explain what kind of Federation he wants —how
he would fix it up without interprovincial Free-
trade ?
Considering all the letters in the anti-
Federal press about how the N.S.W. wine industry
will suffer through the small temporary bonuses
(.£20,000 in all) granted by Yic. Govt, to its wine-
industry, it is remarkable what a dead silence
there is about N.S.W.’s indirect bonus of 6d. a
ton to its coal industry by the exemption from
wharfage dues, and about its free-postage bonus to
the local press. Reading the anti-Billious, organs
one would almost think that bounties were a
purelv Victorian invention and never heard of
elsewhere.
How Sydney D.T. falls over itself. On
page 4 of May 3 it jeered at Barton’s plea for an
end of the Federal agitation with a very loud jeer
indeed:
Mr. Barton might be a proud man if he could achieve
finality. He would be the first to do so.
And on the very next page triumphantly quoted
Labor-member Holman to the effect that the Con-
stitution Bill
Formed an iron-bound and unalterable Constitution, to
which everything must give way, and which would form
the limits of political liberty.
So the Secret Conference Telegraph is mad in
two places: (1) At Barton because he wants to
achieve finality, which is impossible. (2) At Bar-
ton’s Bill because it claims the Bill has achieved
finality and done the impossible when it shouldn’t
ought to. The D.T., like Majah Neild, is not to
be. confuted in its journalistic capacity by any-
thing it may say as a Geebung.
A BUSH COMPLIMENT.
LOCAL RESIDENT : “ I J ear Jones pulled round all
right.”
DOCTOR: “Yes; I consider that one of my most
successful cases.”
L. R.: “ Yes; you couldn't kill Jones with a
blessed axe.”
When the puzzled reader finds Dr. Mac-
Laurin bracketed with C. E. Pilcher, Q.C., as the
last champion of Democracy and the rights and
liberties of the N.S.W. People, it reminds him of
the time when the Doctor’s persuasions led Dibbs
to startle his party and N.S.W. by his famous un-
authorised anti-payment-of-members speech at
Penrith, which not only fell flat itself, but also
contributed towards the flattening out of the
Dibbs-party at the general election.
“ The implements and tools, as well as the
imported material, of almost every trade would
in this colony be taxed to an enormous degree in
excess of the charges made upon them in the
others. Sydney Telegraph, sth May, ’99. This
calm statement is made in the face of the fact that
the federal taxing power is expressly subject to the
condition that the Parliament is “ not to dis-
criminate between states.” The D.T. merely sa.vs
that taxation, though it must be uniform for all
the states, must yet be vastly heavier in N.S.W.
Which any Geebung can understand.
Premier Reid assured the Adelaide people
as he passed through that, despite Sydney D.T.
hysterics, Federation is all right in 'New South
Wales .
The signs both above and below the surface all point to
a substantial majority for union. The undercurrents are
all in our favor, as is evidenced by the singular difficulty
which the anti-Billites experience in securing good
speakers. As for leaders, they have none. Sir George
Dibbs is managing-trustee of the Savings Bank, and as
such owes his daytime to the public. No doubt he
honorably fulfils that obligation. Quite apart from these
matters, however, he is rather a political back number,
having chosen a position which practically debars
him from a very active participation in politics, cer-
tainly in party politics of a local character. Then
there are Dr. M'Laurin and Mr. Pilcher, who
are the representatives of all retrogressive and
ultra-Conservative elements in the community, and
are hopelessly out of sympathy with the people. Dr.
M'Laurin is a man of considerable ability ; Mr. Pilcher, a
man of remarkable ability as a legal advocate, but one
who doesn’t count for anything outside that. In fact, his
opposition is rather an advantage !j the cause than
otherwise, because he is so well known as a man who
never takes any interest in pub..<: affairs unless they
happen to touch his own perse iat prejudices or class
feelings. Then, too, he is a most ineffective speaker on
the platform. With Mr. Haynes, the member for Wel-
lington, Mr. Holman, and Mr. Hughes, the gentlemen 1
have mentioned constitute pretty well all the prominent
opponents of the Bill.
Roderic Quinn’s book of verses, “ The
Hidden Tide ” (Is. 9d. post free from Bulletin
office) has received uncommonly good critical
notices everywhere, and has evidently nestled
close to the hearts of Australian poetry-lovers.
By the way, -what is probably Quinn’s finest story
—“Margaret”—will appear in next Bulletin
Xmas number.

A few representatives of the Fatman clan
gathered at a Melb. hotel last week to congratu-
late lawyer J. M. Davies on his getting back to
Yic. Leg. Council, arid burly Butler (partner of
Softgoods Sargood) had the cool mercantile
audacity to assure friend Davies that “ his unop-
posed return was intended to compensate him to
some extent for his undeserved defeat on a former
occasion.” Mr. Butler, knowing the ropes in
this matter, might as well have admitted that
Davies was a mere “ fail-back ” choice. If Mayor
M‘Eacharn, for instance, had chosen to come
forward for the late James Service’s seat in the
Council, he would have got it without a struggle.

rarely considered, and when the reputation and standing of one brand is lost they have
another make to foist upon the public. “RED BIRD” Cycles are sold in Australia
by the direct branch of the Factory, and, as we have manufactured Bicycles only for
the past 20 years, we are able to give Australians the best value for their money
Knowing these facts, all dealers will belittle “ RED BIRDS ” in their endeavors to

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Inscrutable are the ways of the Sydney police re
tote-shops. After months of inertia, the “foorce,” the
other night, raided a newly-opened place in Market-
street, and marched 15 people off to quod. Yet two or
three “shops” in close proximity to the scene of the
latest swoop have been allowed to openly carry on with-
out let or hindrance. Queer that a newly-started business,
which promised, by reason of the longer prices offered,
to seriously interfere with the operations of the older es-
tablishments, should be so quickly and effectively wiped
out. But, after all, vested interests must be respected.

It used to be the boast of the late Q. Premier
Byrnes that there was no flaw in his anti-gambling Act,
and that people who wanted to evade it would have to
operate in a balloon. And so it seemed until the other day
a bench of the great unpaid at Brisbane Police Court
established a precedent which is likely to give the council
of the churches something to agitate about. Two plain-
clothes police purchased tickets in Dowridge’s sweep.
Dow ridge was summoned fora breach of the Gaming Act.
“ When the bench roll up, there’s something up,” as Sam
Griffith used to say. The bench rolled upon this occasion,
and the majority dismissed the case on the ground that
the contract made for a share in the sweep was made in
Hobart. Police Magistrate Murray declined to sit with
the majority when it announced its decision.

Fitzsimmons and Jeffries fight for the world’s
championship on 26th inst.
* * * *
Black and white heavyweights—lke Stewart
and Charlie Weiner respectively—opposed each other
throughout 20 fiercely-fought rounds at Golden Gate A.C.
(Sydney) last Saturday night. Both were in great buckle.
Weiner, trimly-built, stood erect, making the most of his
height. Stewart spread a pair of “ slomicky ’’-looking
underpins far enough to bring him down 3in. Black sent
in smashing lefts frequently, and several times played a
tattoo on White’s dial when at close quarters—Weiner
being decidedly off at this game. Stewart used the “heel”
of his sinister paw from end to end of the scramble, but
referee failed to heed this palpable breach of the rules
beyond “warning” the offender occasionally a pro-
ceeding which had no effect upon said offender, whose
gloved hand was rarely sent forth on its mission closed.
Weiner battled desperately and determinedly and kept
hooking his left on to Stewart’s bard-as-adamant clossly-
shaven skull, but the blows might just as well have
brought up against a stone wall. The white took severe
punishment without wincing, and displayed several dis-
colorations, and a copious flow of ruby as evidence of the
coon’s handiwork. Ultimately Stewart was awarded the
palm on points and a suffocatingly-packed house
applauded the decision almost to a man. There’s no
“ color-line” in Australia.

Published all over the continent a while back
that Maitland (N.S.W.) blacksmith boxer, “Paddy”
Slavin, was a millionaire mine-owner at Klondvke.
English flies per last mail contain paragraphs, stating
that “ Mrs. F. P. Slavin wishes to tender her best thanks
to” (here follow a number of names), “ who so kindly
came to her assistance at the beginning of the week.”

Captain’s Flat miner Dan O’Connell and Pirate
Club footballer Jack Conlon did not fight at Alhambra
A.C. (Sydney), Saturday night last, as announced. Hun-
dreds of sports were disappointed. Seems that one of
the two promoters, feeling himself aggrieved, had taken
over entire control of the club, but the other swooped
down directly doors opened, and, with the aid of two or
three pugs, tried to oust his whilom partner, who pre-
ferred turning off the gas and closing the doors to being
incontinently thrust out into the night. At time of
writing, efforts were being made to bring the affair off
last (Wednesday) night. Money was plentiful for O’Con-
nell, but the Conlon people held back—a shade of odd 3
didn’t tempt them the least bit.
• * • •
Joe Choynski, the clever and decent Hebrew
pug. who visited Sydney early in the present decade and
fought Joe Goddard, Mick Dooley, and Jaw-breaker Jim
Fogarty, met Kid M’Coy, in ’Frisoo, March 27, and sur-
vived the stipulated score of rounds. Most people de-
clared the affair a fake, averring that M‘Coy could have
secured a knock-out had he liked. Choynski indignantly
denied this, and in an interview candidly said : “ I have
been boxing for the last 14 years, and never during my
career have I been accused of faking. I don’t deny that
I would fake if there was sufficient inducement. Just
show me 8000 or 10,000 dols., and I will lie down. I can’t
see any glory in the business, and I am in it for my bread
and butter.” Choynski was coming to Australia to live
had he beaten M'Coy.

Final of Alhambra A.C. (Sydney) 10.4 boxing
tournament was fought last week. Griffiths and Chant-
ler were the two left in. Chantler, though he beat Wil-
son in second round in one punch, showed little skill—
albeit he stood up and battled toe to toe with his adver-
sary, who, beyond being strong and of good constitution,
had nothing to boast of. Chantler was his from the
second round, but he lacked knowledge of how to adminis-
ter the quietus. The pair collided, rolled over each other,
'rastled and roughed (Chantler being treated to a torrid
time the while) until the stipulated eight-rounds’ journey
had been concluded, when Griffiths was awarded the fat
end of the purse.

Hunter River sculler Towns, having won the
championship of England from Barry, has been chal-
lenged by his fellow-countryman from' N.S.W. South
Coast. Thus two Australians will probably contest the
English championship. Rowing is one of the games they
particularly fancied themselves at “down under”; the
other is boxing. That memorable battle in London be-
tween Australians Peter Jackson and "Paddy” Slavin
involved the championship of England.
• • * •
A glorious burst of “ loyalty ” took place at
Melb. Democratic Club t’other week. The “ bloomin’
Demmo.” these times is the recognised pitch for political
boxing matinees—the place where Bantam Bill and young
Oorkey tap one another’s claret for a purse of suv’rins,
provided by one or more admirers of the Noble h’art.
The other afternoon, it was the gents o’ “The Belle of
New York ’’ wot provided a fiver to be scrapped for, so, in
honor of those distinguished stryngers, the piano and
violin led off with a fantasia on national h’airs, termi-
nating in “Star-spangled Banner” and “Rule Britt.”
Great applause from the assembled democrats, after
which Oscar Girard, as principal ’Murkan visitor, de-
manded “God Save the Queen.” The whole crowd of
h'art patrons then stood up—Democrats, comedians and
pugs—and sang “ Gorsave” in 10 different keys. Another
matinee, under the same patronage, is due at the
“ Demmo.” to-day (Thursday), and the Hanthem will be
shook up with more violence than before, ’cos the outer
oircle of broken-nosed barrytones has gained confidence
as regards the bloomin’ toon, and will chuck it orf their
chests in a sportsmanlike manner.

Be the general opinion that a fighting-man must
necessarily be a tough. Jack Goggin, the crack middle-
weight, whose home is in West Wyalong (N.S.W.), is in
Sydney at time of writing on some municipal mission.
Jack ably fills the position of president of the local

Old-time prize-fighter Tom Allen, 59 years of
age, will probably be electrocuted, or, if unlucky, end his
days in Sing Sing prison. At St. Louis (U.S.A.), Feb. 26,
in his own saloon, he drew a bead on each of two men,
killing one and badly wounding the other. Allen is a
native of Brummagem (Eng.), and was prominent in the
sixties when a battle with the bares generally ended in a
riot. In America he was licked by Jem Mace 29 years ago,
lost to Joe Goss on a foul after fighting in two rings,
beat Mike M'Cool into a jelly, but was robbed of the
deoision through M‘Cool’s backers breaking into the ring
and using bludgeons, pistols and knives. Allen was
always a desperate character, and frequently got mixed
up in the toughest of tough things. He had a gun on
the referee of a fight in America, in ’6B, threatening that
unless his man got the verdict there’d be murder.

At a recent Melb. glove-fight, a would-be dead-
head who sent in his card to the management described
himself as “representative of the Christian World.”
* * * «
There was a big mob of motley gatherers at Melb.
Democratic Club, the other afternoon, to see a couple of
boxing-goes for small purses. The club committee, which
had fixed up the programme as a “ return matinee” to
the “ Belle of N.Y. ” co., provided the necessary induce-
ment for one S. Cohen to tackle a well-meaning young
man named Cole, best of eight rounds ; but, after three
rounds of merciful stoushing by the stronger candidate,
the referee gave a verdict for Cohen, and the defendant
Cole went away to bathe his bleeding nose. Nickey Peach
and Ted O’Neil (for a “fiver” presented by the New
Yorkers) were better matched, Peach winning fairly on
points. Nevertheless, their 12-round go was a poor
exhibition of the noble art, from a practical
point of view. O’Neil, a game, indefatigable young
blacksmith, with a long slender waist and par-
ticularly thin arms, received somewhat more punishment
than he gave, although he started well by cheerfully
bunging-up Peach’s left eye. The “fight” proved to be
a rather monotonous succession of short exchanges, fol-
lowed by a clinch for safety, and Peach was the clincher-
in-chief. As the shorter man, he dived his head under
O’Neil’s arm every time, and was generally in an excel-
lent position for getting murdered if they had been
sjogging one another for dear life, without the interven-
tion of a referee. That’s where the foolishness of prize
boxing comes in. The “ cleverer ” artist scores by virtue
of arts that are neither noble nor defensive when judged
apart from the rules of the game. An exhibition spar is
a lively, rational entertainment as a rule, but the average
fight for a given number of rounds is all tangle and
tactics.
* • * *
The extraordinary deoisions in recent glove-
fights both in Melb. and Sydney only show once more
how little about the theory or the rules of boxing the
average referee knows. The laws of any sport are not to
be interpreted with the rigidity of an act of parliament;
but many, regarded as competent referees, seem to
think that so long as men don’t chew each other’s
ears, or kick each other in the bingie, they may
do all else they please. The recent Sydney in-
stance of a referee passing a foul that disabled one of
the boxers and giving the fight to the guilty other,
is only one example of many. Writer remembers one of
the most prominent athletes in Australia telling a crowd
in a bar that he had not given a big fight to a certain
man because his opponent “ had a reputation,” and that
a decision to the other would have meant an attack in
England and America on the referee’s honesty.

Nothing astounding about the South of England
v. Australia cricket-match up to Bulletin press-going.
The Englishmen’s first innings (top-scored by Fry with 81
and having a half-century to Hayward’s credit) was ren-
dered a moderate 246 by two B’s (Ranji and Board), two
s’s (Abel and Grace), and a 2 to Brockwell. Australia
had 35—Darling, 24 ; Iredale, 4 ; and Hill (not out), 7.

North Sydney and Paddington clubs concluded
on Saturday the final match for the Sydney Cricket Pre-
miership, when N. Sydney scored 342 for the loss of five
wickets, as against Paddington’s 175, and was declared
the winner. The win is a great feather in the cap of
N.S., as the club is chiefly composed of 3’oung players,
and will do more towards giving local cricket a fillip than
if a team of old and representative players had come out
on top.
* * * *
Footballers had rather a warm day for the open-
ing of the Sydney season. Randwick beat University by
9 points to 5. The play was very equal, but Randwicks
played a more level-headed game and deserved their win.
Sydney v. Marrickville was a well-oontested bout, Sydney
winning’ by 8 points to 3. Marrickville made its d6but
in senior play, and its excellent showing came rather
as a surprise. Pirates ran over Parramatta with 9to nil;
and Wallaroo beat Buccaneer, after a rattling good game,
by 11 points to 5.

Q.T.C. St. Leger seems a good thing for Boreas,
who ran second to Drake the other day over a mile and
a-half. Boreas is a big, long-striding, tearaway customer
of the Babel order, but is unreliable, and dislikes punish-
™et|t °r strong opposition. However, with Archiemore
disabled, Dundonald a doubtful quantity, Angelos very
sore, and the others engaged eithers sprinters or weeds,
Beatties colt will probably come in on his own.

Brisbane Cup and Moreton Handicap entries
have closed without any Southern nominations. Alleged
cause : Insufficient prize-money inducement, with cer-
tainty of welter-weight on even a fair performer.
A country moke, The Kiss, did Ikey Mo a good
turn at Rosehill on Saturday by winning the Welter Mile.
One or two laid a little—from twenties down to tens—
against her, but the majority had a “skinner.” The
rider s colors (a big, flaming red cross on white ground)
was as straight a tip for Hospital Saturday as M’Carthy’s
green jacket was on St. Patrick’s Day. The heavily-
backed “certainty” from Wootten’s stable, Valorous,
ran second, a length behind, while York and Claret, two
others with money on them, failed to get placed.
* » * *
Nevermore, winner of the big race at Rosehill
on Saturday, was somewhat of an outsider, as Barleigh,
W3 7 along, Crosslake, and Bellwood (in that order) started
at shorter prices. The cute section were on the winner
to a man. Touts had noticed his early-morning perform-
ances at Randwick lately, and also noted his meritorious
third to The Kiss an hour before, for he was nearly
knocked down twice in the race, and then finished three
lengths behind Valorous.
* * * •
The finish of Highweight Handicap at Rosehill
on Saturday was interesting. Loads of money went on
Ottoman, which touts reckoned would have come home
“on his own.” Caledonia and Amourette (stable mates)
were heavily supported, so were Monogram and Wat
Tyler. Benedict, as usual, led the field a dance. Books
offered 10 to 1 against him, knowing he would “shut up,”
but he lasted just long enough to win by a nose at least,
as seen from the press stand, though the judge only
placed him third. Which recalls an incident on same
course three or four years ago, when metallician “ Bill ”
Lyons’s nag was similarly dealt with.
• * * *
Wongy, among the first-flight hurdlers of the
province, started favorite, performed ingloriously, and
ended his career in Rosehill Hurdle-race, Saturday last.
For same event Bertie was given out a good thing by
knowing ones, and the Canterbury “ push ” were on him
to a man, but he failed to run up to form. All the same,
writer means to have half-a-sov. on Bertie at next Rand-
wick meeting. Maluha easily led the field to last hurdle,
and as much as 3 to 1 was laid on his chance in the run-
ning, but Kiora, an outsider, proved too good at the
finish.
* * * *
Some of the few straight N.S.W. owners had a
well-deserved turn at Rosehill on Saturdav, Mr. H. V. Foy
scoring with Auld-Lang-Syne, and the Whit" Bros., of
Belltrees, winning the Hurdles noth Kiora, a black geld-
ing by Blue Mountain. The Whites bought Kiora for £4O
odd after his winning a country hack-race t’other day.

The tennis shown in the recent interprovincial
tournament at Sydney Cricket Ground was poor com-
pared with that of a season or two ago. Victorian “Gus”
Kearney was the only male to show really first-class form;
and he, against a player such as Curtis was at his best,
would go down three times out of four. In the cham-
pionship, Kearney beat a weak lot of opponents pretty
well as he liked, whilst Miss Howitt won the Ladies’
Championship after a hard tussle with the improving and
persevering Miss Payton. Curtis, who had to drop out
of N.S.W. team through ill-health, appeared in some
double events, but condition beat him, and he will soon
lose his reputation if he persists in playing when in no
form.

A certain American cyclist landed in Sydney
some months ago and has since not been heard of.
There is down South a new-comer who wins
everything but finals. In training, the comparative
ease with which he picks a man up in his sprint is beauti-
ful to behold.

A small man, with a face like the rising sun,
made a sensation recently on St. Kilda Road (Melb.) by
riding an extraordinary-looking bike under the noses of
horses as they came along, and then darting off again
barely in time to avoid accident. On investigation, the
small man was found to have marked a large figure
8 and a broad - arrow on the road as a starting-
point, and his bike, which had thick rope tyres, was
minus pedals and a saddle. A piece of paper gummed
on where the maker’s label should be bore the significant
word, “ Kew,” and the cyclist, who turned out to have
escaped from that asylum, was promptly returned
thither.

Lacrosse-clubs are springing up everywhere in

For the first time lacrosse will be played on Adelaide Oval,

“Saved ” : “ Has one aspect of the Sydney Safe
Deposit occurred to you? Most people insure against
loss by fire and receive money compensation for property
destroyed. But there are some things—valuable papers,
heirlooms, etc. —which can never be replaced, and the
loss of which means a fortune. The Safe Deposit, for a
comparatively small sum, not only insures against the
loss of these things, ft saves the articles themselves.
What is a guinea or two a year compared with a docu-
ment upon which thousands depend?” Safe Deposit is

Some Sydney Sunday Times tales :
Does the average wage-earner know that if the pro-
posed Braddon Blot tariff comes into operation he will
pay 265. or 30s. (or more) for the goods he now pays £1
for?
There is no such thing as a “Braddon Blot
Tariff,” nor ever will be, except in the imagina-
tion of the Sunday Shellback. The “ Braddon
Blot ” merely provides that 15s. of every 20s.
of revenue raised by Customs —if there is any
Customs revenue—must be either given back to
the States so that they can pay the interest on
their public debts, or reserved by the Common-
wealth to pay interest with.
“Under the Bill the N.S.W. penny post will have to
go.”— News Item.
Same old lie. There is nothing in the Consti-
tution Bill to say that penny-postage will be
abolished. And as four provinces already have
penny-postage and only two have not, there is
every chance that all will have penny-postage.
Again :
Neither Dr. M'Laurin nor Mr. Pilcher anticipates a
career in the Federal Parliament —either as a seven-hun-
dred-pounder or a four-thousand-pounder.
No one but the pair themselves know what they
anticipate, and their actions are quite as open
to suspicion as those of any other leader. Also,
they are such crystallised Tories that their con-
demnation of the Bill should make the workers
seriously consider if that fact alone is not
enough to justify any Democrat in voting for it.
Some more :
Dr. M'Laurin and Mr. Pilcher did noble service on be-
half of the people on Friday evening. These gentlemen
are not active politicians, and no doubt would have been
more comfortable in their homes. They had no great
stake to gain by pushing a cause on the platform ; but
love of the land they live in, and regard for their fellow
citizens, brought them out to endeavor to open the eyes
of the people to the great risks surrounding them in con-
nection with the Federal Enabling Bill.
And they succeeded.
Members of the Leg. Council not active poli-
ticians ! ! These hoary champions of unswerv-
ing conservatism, arch-priests of bowelless capi-
talism, didn’t fight tooth-and-nail against the
land-and-income taxation—the taxation of their
own class—did they ? No, they refrained
through “ love of the land they live in” and
“regard for their fellow citizens”! Rats!
Once more :
Here was an old man, with not the most attractive
platform style in the world—in fact, possessed of some
mannerisms calculated to stimulate the ribald interjector.
The doctor is indeed an old man—a very deep
old man ; and he guarded himself with great
cunning from the attacks of the “ ribald inter-
jector” by admitting to his meeting (excepting
in the gallery, and even that tinpot corner was
carefully faked) by ticket only. Also, tickets
were refused to anyone but Geebungs and those
for whom Geebungs could go bail. Likewise
there was kept behind the stage a man in shirt-
sleeves, a large, brawny ferocious looking man
with an aggressive jaw and huge biceps to act as
chucker-out. And when a prominent Geebung,
one of his own bosses, attempted to address the
meeting the large man in shirtsleeves, mistak-
ing him for a Federalist, seized him round the
middle and hurled him down on to the reporters’
table. No wonder Dr. M'Laurin, M.L.C.,
had a patient hearing. If the peoplejwho in-
vite only friends to hear them talk, keep a
hired bully on the premises to bang against the
floor the skulls of those who disagree with
them, don t get a patient hearing, who in the
world will ?


THE BEAUTY OF THE
MASSE Y- HARRIS
BICYCLE
Has always been famous. This year
we have surpassed all previous
efforts and produced a bicycle as
near perfection as our skill
and the practically unlimited re-
sources of our great factories can
make it. The design is elegant
and graceful, and every detail
of workmanship and finish has been
brought to tempting ideality.
ONE GRADE ONLY
THAT THE HIGHEST.
We confine our efforts and the efforts
of every one of the 500 skilled
mechanics in our factories to the
perfecting of one model, one
only; and no maker who scatters his
energies over half a dozen models
can hope to compete with us. For
years we have tested, improved and
perfected this one model of
Massey-Harris Bicycle
until, we believe, it is superior in
every way to any other bicycle that
has yet been built.

This company is being formed for the purpose of ac-
quiring creek bed, known as Barwidgee, for dredging,
situated in the Ovens district, within the mining district
of Beechworth.
The particular ground to be secured consists of about
200 acres, situated on the Barwidgee Creek, having about
three miles of the creek, with a width of about 400 yards
This ground has been thoroughly inspected, and has
been proved to be highly auriferous. The details will be
found in the reports attached. Attention is directed to
the report of Mr. Reid, who has been well-known in the
Ovens district for the last 43 years, and latterly owing to
his intimate connection with his dredging operations
under the Hon. J. A. Wallace.
It is proposed to work the property by means of a
bucket dredge, similar to those now in use in New Zea-
land, to be of an up-to-date pattern, combining all
modern approved appliances, capable of treating 100 loads
per hour.
The cost of this bucket dredge is estimated at £5OOO.
This particular property is well adapted for bucket
dredging, being peculiarly free from obstructions;
neither is there any prospecting or any experimental
work to be done ; thus operations once commenced are
reproductive from the start.
This property is surrounded by ranges which have been
proved in places to contain gold-bearing reefs, the
denudation of which by natural process has enriched this
creek, and deposited much alluvium.
Under the bucket-dredging system in New Zealand, the
loss of gold is insignificantly small, being rarely more
than three per cent. ; and the system has become so per-
fect that poor ground, having an average value of under
a grain and a-half (1J grains) to the cubic yard can now
be made to pay dividends.
Under half-a-grain to the load will pay all working ex-
penses. The returns from this company’s property, it is
believed, will realise 8 grains per cubic yard. This means
a dividend of at least 2s. per share per month after pay-
ing all expenses.
This plant, when completed, will put through 140,000
loads per week(vvorking 18 shifts per week of eight hours),
after deducting 400 loads for any stoppages which may
occur.
The average value of the residue to be Bgr. per load,
thus the weekly output would be 2330 z. ; value of gold,
£4 2s. 6d. per oz. ; working expenses per week, £75;
would leave a dividend of 2s. per share per month, or
£BB6 per week for dividends.
There is every reason for believing that the auriferous
value of this property is far in excess of figures as cal-
culated.
In the appendix will be found some interesting infor-
mation showing the success of the dredging companies in
New Zealand, with some references from the Alexandra
Herald. Otago, New Zealand, and from the Otago Wit-
ness of 30th June, 1895.
The contract with the vendors, and the draft rules and
regulations of the company, may be inspected at the
office of the solicitor for the company, Mr. J. Woolf, 43
Market-street.
Mr. John Thomas Reid, mining engineer for many
years, reports as follows : He worked on same creek 40
years ago and averaged from £l2 to £l4 per week. He
knows the property has a run of gold from end to end,
and by dredging all the gold will be obtained, and once
the company is in working order it will pay large and
regular dividends.

SIXTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS,
With the Accounts for the Half-year to 10th October, 1898, presented to the Proprietors at the Annual General
Meeting held on Thursday, 23rd March,' 1899.
Report.
rpHE directors submit to the proprietors the balance-sheet as at 10th October last, with the profit account for th e
half-year to that date. After providing for rebate on bills current, for British and Colonial rates and taxes, and
for all bad and doubtful debts, the net profit for the half-year amounted to 1.64,147 14s. sd. The addition of £8822
7s. 3d., brought forward from the previous half-year, gives a disposable balance of £62,970 Is. Bd., of which the
dividend declared will absorb £48,000. From the balance remaining a sum of 15000. has been appropriated to com-
plete payment of cost of the extension of the London office premises, now being carried out, leaving j. 9970 Is. Bd. to
be carried forward to next account.
Up to the date of the latest mail advices rain was still much wanted in some parts of New South Wales and
Queensland, and, although telegrams since received convey the welcome intelligence of a fall in some of these dis-
tricts, much damage has been done by the dryness of the season. The pastoral interest has suffered more in this
respect than the agricultural, the wheat crop, as a whole, being estimated to yield a considerable surplus for export.
The price of wool has varied, that of “ Merino ” having appreciably advanced, whilst that of “ Crossbred ” shows
a more than corresponding fall.
In New Zealand the season has been a fair one, but the effect of the fall in the price of “ Crossbred” wool,
which forms the principal part of the New Zealand production, has been severely felt.
The frozen meat business remains steady, and the fluctuations in price having been less than in previous years,
the out-turn should prove more satisfactory to all concerned.
A gradual improvement in the general business of the colonies continues to be shown, though the progress is
slow. Properties are changing hands more freely than for some years past, and enterprise would doubtless revive
with more favorable seasons.
The dividend declared is at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum on £1 4s. per share for the half-year, and will be
payable, free of income-tax, in London and in the colonies, on the 24th inst.

Ayer’s Hair Vigor
/
What does
it do?
It causes the oil glands
in the skin to become more
active, making the hair
soft and glossy, precisely
as nature intended.
It cleanses the scalp
from dandruff and thus re-
moves one of the great
causes of baldness.
It makes a better cir-
culation in the scalp and
stops the hair from coming out.
ir prevents and
ft cures baldness.
Ayer’s Hair Vigor will surely make hair
grow on bald heads, provided only there is
any life remaining in the hair bulbs.
It restores color to gray or white hair. It
does not do this in a moment, as will a hair
dye; but in a short time the gray color of
age gradually disappears and the darker color
of youth takes its place.

THE ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS ol
Sept. 28, 1895, says:
“ If I were asked which single medicine I should
prefer to take abroad with me, as likely to be
most generally useful, to the exclusion of all
others, I should say Chlorodyne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.”
South Australia has just had its biggest
thing in bazaars, promoted by A. W. Hendry in
aid of tha Industrial School for the Blind, and
produoing about £3OOO. Mr. Hendry, who is
himself blind (the result of trying, as a boy, to
undo a boot-laceknot with a fork), organised 82
“ centres ”of helpers. He has done most of the
secretarial work, and, in addition, has had the
whole of the general management. Altogether
his organising ability lias led him to be the most-
boomed, man in Adelaide for a month.
“Puyyaka ” discourses on the re-lit cigar
question :
“ B.B.” (11/2, ’99) wants to know why oigai-butts smoke
harshly. Let’s try to explain. Cigar tobacco differs
essentially from that used for pipe consumption. It is
considerably richer in the volatile oils, and by their dis-
ti.lation produces a larger amount of pyridine, which,
ami not nicotine, is one of the main bye-products of com-
busted tobacco-leaf. This pyridine is again broken down
by the heated draught as the cigar is smoked ; but if the
draught is allowed to cease and the cigar goes out, it will
remain in the butt undecomposed. Cigarettes contain
little pyridine-producing elements, and often very little
tobacco ; but the cigar principle holds good. In pipe
tobacco, on the other hand, not only is less pyridine
developed, but by the fact of its being enclosed in the
bowl the heat is more constant and it does not
deposit until reaching the stem. It is baked out of
the tobacco when one lights up for a second time.
Few people know how to smoke a pipe properly.
Having cut and rolled the tobacco (no true devotee uses
cut-up, J. M. Barrie notwithstanding), the bowl is filled
to the smoker’s personal liking, scorning the jibes of on-
lookers. Then, with a preliminary inhalation to test
whether an envious obstruction has choked the bore, the
true smoker lets the tip of a glowing stick rest on the
very centre of the full bowl. He follows it up with
anxious care, till a tiny glowing spark rests on the brown
bed, and then puffs carefully. The red light eats its way
into the surface, and sends up a gentle glow from
beneath the surface as the surrounding weed bakes.
Then is his time. With a dexterous pressure of the index
finger—some prefer the middle —he gently crushes the
baked : surface stratum on to the glowing bed beneath,
and his pipe is lit. “ Trouble in a re-lit pipe ?” Doesn’t
“ B.B.” know what Charles Keene, greatest of black-and-
white artists, and of smokers, says about dottles ? Pipe
or cigarette ! Go to !
“ Treb ” on the same subject :
It is a sin to light a cigar twice, but, alas, we are not
all millionaires ; so when I lay aside a cigar, I carefully
blow through it. It is the dead smoke in it which gives a
cold cigar the bad taste and smell—the better the cigar
the worse the odor. Much the same applies to cigarettes.
With a pipe it is entirely different. The sweetest puff of
all is to be obtained from a pipe quarter-smoked—let grow
quite cold and then re-lit—much better than if smoked
right through.
HAVE YOU
BAD LEG
with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion V If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended various hospitals and had
medical advice, and been told your case is hopeless, or
advised to submit to amputation ; but do not, for I CAN
CUBK YOU. I don’t say perhaps ; but I WILL. Because
others have failed is no reason for not now being cured.

Mr. 0. J. A. NIELSEN,
A. Living Witness oi the virtues of the
Aifaline Herbal Remedies.
Kalgoorlie, September 12, 1898.
To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir.—l feel it my duty to write and tell you how
your remedies have cured me.
I suffered great agony with WEAK NERVES and
RHEUMATIOS, and I sent for some of your ALEALINE
REMEDIES, which completely cured me, and I have felt
as well as I could wish, although it is two rears ago.
I also tried your ALKALINE UNIVERSAL PILLS,
which completely cleared my skin and purified my blood,
and I am now using your ALKALINE HAIR RESTORER,
which has thoroughly cleaned the scalp and made the
hair grow again, and it has gradually turned the hair
from being grey to that of its original color. I have also
recommended your Remedies for a number of different
complaints and I have never known them to fail, but to
do all that was claimed for them. I have great pleasure
to recommend these remedies to all sufferers, as I know
they can be depended on.
You are at liberty to publish this as well as my photo.
Yours truly, 0. J. A. NIELSEN.

To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir.—l can truthfully assert that sim-e using your
Eucalyptus Oil and Aifaline Rheumatic Pills I have ex-
perienced an immunity from my attack of sciatic. I have
recommended the Aifaline Remedies to a number of my
constituents, and I will do the same to all whom I hear
complaining of rheumatic attacks. With kind regards,
I have the honor to be, yours truly,

Nerves, Liver, and Kidneys Cured.
175 Young-street, Annandale, Sydney.
To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir,—Having suffered for some time from a com-
plaint of the liver and kidneys, for which I took medical
advice, with no effect, I one day was fortunate enough to
pick up one of your books in the bush. I was thus in-
duced to try your Aifaline Remedies, and their effect was
magical. I have often since recommended them to my
neighbors, all of whom have felt the benefit as well as
myself. I cannot express how glad lamat my recovery,
as several doctors had given me up, as my husband can
testify.—Yours truly, (Signed) Mrs. H. SMITH.

BUCHU BITTERS
Baron Berzelius’ Report.
These Bitters I recommend in DYSPEPSIA, CHROM IC RHEUMATISM and CUTA-
NEOUS AFFECTIONS. The action of Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidney and Bladder than any other berl>al plant; and it also assists persons suffer-
ing from Skin Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and inducing perspiration.
Head What Medical Men Say About Them .
BJERKIN, M.D. The Bitter is pure, and not like others in overdoses. It has a remark-
able influence on the Liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it when deranged,
and restores healthy evacuations in cases of habitual.costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D. :- -BBBB—I find these Bitters a most valuable and wholesome
Tonic, being pure and strengthening ; a stimulant to the Liver, assisting Digestion. I therefore
thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D. It is the purest of Bitters, and exerts a peculiar influence over the
Liver.

GERMAN ELECTRIC APPL T ANCE AGENCY,

Theory of the Flaming Swo^xl.
“Ah, talk of blessings ! What a blessing is diges-
tion ! To digest. Do you know what it means?
It is to have the sun always shining and the shade
always ready for you. It is to be met by smiles
and greeted with kisses. It is to hear sweet sounds,
to sleep with pleasant dreams, to be touched ever
by gentle, soft, cool hands. It is to be in Paradise.
“ There came a great indigestion upon the earth
and it was called a deluge. All the evil comes
from this. Macbeth could not sleep-; it was the
supper, not the murder. His wife talked and
talked; it was the supper again. Milton had a
bad digestion, and Carlyle must have had the
worst digestion in the world. Ah !to digest is to
be happy ! ”
There! —how does that strike you for a burst of
eloquence ? I quote from Trollope. If there is any-
thing wrong about the theology you must hold him
responsible. As for its physiology and pathology
(pardon all these “ologies ”) I can answer for the
correctness of these two. And so can millions of
people besides me. They speak of the curse of in-
digestion continually in every language; they
groan and writhe under it in every land ana
climate.
‘ e F or many years,” says one of this innumerable
army of martyrs, “I was obliged to bear as best I
could the torments of indigestion. My appetite
was practically destroyed. I ate, of course, because
one must eat or die ! but after meals I had great
pain at the chest and around the sides.
Sleep almost forsook my pillow, and naturally I
was tired and exhausted. Sometimes better and
then worse, but never free from pain and illness, I
lived on with little or no hope of getting well. It
is hardly necessary to say that I had medical
treatment, yet no real benefit resulted from it.
Happily at this time Mother Seigel’s Syrup was
brought to my notice, and so strongly commended
that I laid aside other medicines, which were doing
me no good, and began using this one only.
“ In ashort time I realised a great improvement;
food agreed with me and I gained strength. A
little later -continuing to take the Syrup regularly
as directed—the pains at the stomach, sides and
chest wholly ceased, and I have not felt them
since. My indigestion was cured at last, and, I en-
joyed the blessing of health. My son, who suffered
severely from rheumatism has been relieved by
Mother Seigel’s Syrup as by nothing else he ever
tried. In gratitude I give you full permission to
publish my letter should you desire.” (Signed)
(Mrs.) Ann Barker, Field Lane, Braughing, Ware,
Herts. Oct. 7, 1898.
It was a fortunate circumstance for Mrs. Sarah
Gell, of Melchbourne, Bedfordshire, that one day
she had a personal talk with Mr. Smith, the
butcher at Bushden. He told the lady that in his
opinion if she went on suffering from indigestion
and asthma (one of its consequences) it would be
because she neglected to use Mother Seigel’s
Syrup. “ And, ” said Mr. Smith, “ I speak from
knowledge.” She had been ill with this abomin-
able ailment for many years, and had spent time
and money in unavailing efforts to obtain relief.
Acting on Mr. Smith’s advice, Mrs. Gell began
using this remedy at once, and tells the outcome
in a letter of which we have room for the con-
clusion only
“I was'better almost immediately, and was
soon as well and healthy as one could wish to be.
Now I keep ‘ Mother Siegel ’ in the house, and it
never fails to help us when needed for any passing
complaint.” (Signed) Sarah Gell, Oct. sth, 1898.
Judging from the force of his comment on the
disease, 1 should say Mr. Trollope knew some-
thing about indigestion from experience. Most
literary people do. To them, and to all other
victims I confidently commend the best remedy
yet found —Mother Seigel’s Syrup.
No Household should he without it. To Farmers it is
invaluable. It should be found in every Stable.
All Athletes should use it. It Cures Speedily and
Permanently.
m
Aches anrl Pains vanish instantly. A Child may use it
without fear. It has no equal as an Embrocation. Has
effected more Cures than any other specific ever offered
to the public.

COUGHS, COLDS on the CHEST,
BRONCHITIS & ASTHMA
Rapidly Cured by
Heame’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its
wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of bron-
chitis, distressing cough, difficulty in breathing, hoarse-
ness, pain or soreness in the chest, experience delightful
and immediate relief, and to those who are subject to
colds on the chest it is invaluable, as it effects a complete
cure-. It is most comforting in allaying tickling and irri-
tation in the throat, and giving strength to the voice, and
it never allows a cough or asthma to become chronic. No
house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a
dose is generally sufficient, and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. lIEARNE.—Dear Sir, —I had a bad attack
of Bronchitis for six months, with dreadful hacking cough
day and night and great quantity of phlegm. Night
sweats came on and pains in my chest, and I got so weak
that I could not leave my bed. ' At this stage I was pro-
nounced to be in consumption. I had a lot of medicines
of different kinds, but nothing did me any good until,
reading in the Age of your ‘ Bronchitis Cure,’ I got a
bottle, and after taking two doses I was much improved.
After taking two bottles the cough and night sweats left
me, my appetite returned, and I was able to get up ; and
am now in good health, for which I am truly grateful, and
shall recommend your Medicine to all my friends.—Yours
truly, E. SMITH, Halpin Park, Nhill; Victoria.”
“ After suffering from asthma until I was 17 years old,
and having been under a great many different treatments,
without benefit, I was induced to try Hearne’s Medicine
for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this medicine,
I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then, which was
jn the beginning of 1883, 14 years ago, I have not had the
slightest return of it. The Medicine quite cure me, and
I have much pleasure in recommending it.—ALEX. J.
ANDERSON, Geelong, Victoria.”
“We, the aindersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it was per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
the Rev. John Sinclair, Myers-street, Geelong, and 59
other leading residents.

The Case of
Mr. Thos. Lee.
(JR om the “ Peniith , Times.”)
(by our special reporter.)
Oar reporter crossed the Xepe n at Pen-
rith, towards E u Plains, but fo..nd Mr.
Thomas Lee, atravellingn erchant, wasabsent
from his home. However, the neighbours
-informed the newspaper >■ an that if he fol-
lowed the road towards the mountains his
seareh woul I be rewarded, and sure enough
Mr. Lee’s tilted wagon soon hove in sight.
The reporter mounted the vehicle, and
whilst comfortably jogging on to ards >he
mountains, took down the following narra-
tive straight from Mr. Lee’s own lips *
“In one of my journeys I caught cold, a
heavy feeling in the head came on, accom-
panied I y an
Alarming High Tempsraiurfc
jl knew.l was in for some sort of sickness*
but couldn’t hazard a guess as to what it
was to be. Hnwev r, I very soon, found out,
for that nigh I was seized with
.Violent Griping Pains
in the bowe’s. These wer so severe that
they made me cry out and roll over and o er
,in agony. My sufferin s continued all
night. I coul- n’t lie down, hut was oblige ■
to sit up and lay bold of the bedposts to
stea >y lnysel when I felt the s asms coming
on. In the morning 1 had terrible purging
—nothing would stop the diai r. cea I tried
heavy does of brandy and thlorodyne, but
wi hno good effect. The purging still con-
tinued.”
“ What was the matter?”
“I Lelieve that I had a fit of Eng’ish
cn.olera. My head was heavy, dull, and
.-ched without a moment's cessation. Cold
tti.d clammy perspiration continually broke
out all over me, and my hands and feet were
oy col l, although it was summer time. The
persistence of the diarrhoea
Fairly Wore Me Out.
I had no rest by day or by n'ght.”
“ How long did it continue ? ”
“For days—till I could almost say it had
become chronic. I had not the least in-
clination to eat anything and was so weak
that I couM only j st creep about the house,
a,nd eve;ry r now and again I had to
Lie Down Quite Exhausted.
It s unnecessary for me to say I could now
pay no sort of attention to my business
My wife had to do as best she . ould.”
“ Wha else did you suffer from ? ”
“Biliousness and si k headache. I tried
to eat nourishing things to keep n y strength
up, but my food caused me to vomit
frequent’y. At length I could hardly bear
to see anything to ej.t i laced b> fore me. I
turned asi kly yellow colour. Tlier was a
rfeadfully foul taste in my mouth, and an
almos ■ (on inual rumbling and growling
noise going on in my inside. Sometimes I
would g t a bit better for a day or two, and
, then the pain and j urging, which, mind you,
never c mpleteiy stopped, wo.Jd come on
again with renewed violen e. Na urally
enough I fell away considerably in weight,
an i began to get quite thin, and to wear

every day. I can tell you I was pulled
down. You wouldn’t have known me. I
was taking brandy and pain killer, and beef
tea, and all sorts of other diarrhoea mixtures
wlurh my wife got me from the chemists,
ana not a bit of good from any one of them.
At las I was so bad I
Couldn’t Get Out of Bed.”
Did you get no relief at all ? ”
“Yes, in some cases, after using some
strong stimulating dr g, but the diarrhoea
an ■ pain only came on wors- than ever soon
after the effect or the stimulant had died
away. You see, it was not a mere pain
reliever that I wanted—'hat only put off
the evil day I wanted some remedy that
would effect a radical cure Some remedy
that would strike at the cause of my illness,
for I thought there must be something more
serious the matter with me than a mere
local irritation in the bowels, else I should
not have been ill so long. I am a greai
reader, *tnd when I wasn’t in too mucl
pain f
Passed The Weary Time
by reading books a d newspapers. I some-
how or other got hold of a little book. I
read there of many people who had re-
covered from all sorts of ailments by the use
of one particular remedy. Names and ad-
dresses and full particulars were given.
‘ That’s goo ! enough for me’ I said, ‘l’ll give
this remedy a show to see what it can do.’
I did. After about eight or nine doses
there was a great decrease in the purging
and pain, and at the same time I felt an in-
clination to eat.
* This Is The Remedy
for me,’ I told my wife. ‘ I’ve found it at
last—Clements Tonic.”’
“ How did you get on with it?”
“ Famously : it completely put a stop to
the purging, and my poor wearied bowels
now had the chance of a rest. Clements
Tonic was not a mere temporary expedient,
for there was no sign of the diarrhoea coming
on again, and, as a matter of fact, I’ve been
free from it ever since. Well, I got better
and stronger ever day. Having a good
appetite I
Picked Up My Strength
hand over fist. I could feel Clements Tonic
invigorating me throughout my whole
system, and, to cut a long story short, in
three weeks’ time I was out again in my
wagon as strong as before my illness.”
“ May I put wha> you say in the Tunes'!”
“ You may, most decidedly, as I think it
ought to b generally known that

is to be so easily gob. I’m sure the remedy
that cured me will cure others.”

COUNTRY TRIAL ORP€R RESPECTFULLy SOLICITED.
On Our Selection.—Joe’s Snake.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Joe was a naturalist. He spent a lot of time
time that Dad considered should have been em-
ployed cutting burr or digging potatoes —ear-
marking bears and bandicoots, and catching
goannas, and letting them go without their tails, or
coupled in pairs with pieces of greenhide. The
paddock was full of goannas in harness and slit-
eared bears. They belonged to Joe.
Joe also took an interest in snakes, and used to
poke amongst logs and brush-fences in search of
raresspeci mens. Whenever he secured a good one
he put it in a cage and left it there until it died or
got out, or Dad threw it, cage and all, right out
of the parish.
One day, while Mother and Sal were out with
Dad, Joe came home with a four-foot black snake
in his hand. It was a beauty. So sleek and lithe
and lively ! H ■ carried it by the tail, its head
swinging dose to his bare leg, and the thing yearn-
ing for a g.ab at him. But Joe understood the
ways of a reptile.
There was no cage—Dad had burnt the last one
so Joe walked round the room wondering where
to put his prize. The cat came out of the bed-
room and mewed and followed him for the snake.
He r told her to go away. She didn’t go. She
reached for the snake with her paw. It bit her.
She spat and sprang in the air and rushed outside
with her back up. Joe giggled and wondered how
long the cat would live.
The Rev. Macpherson, on his way to christen
M'Kenzie’s baby, called in for a drink, and smil-
ngly asked after Joe’s health.
“Hold this kuk-kuk-cove, then,” Joe said,
ha,nding the parson the reptile, which was wrig-
gling, and biting at space, “an’ I’ll gug-gug-get
y’. one.” But when Mr. Macpherson saw the thing
was alive he jumped back and fell over the dog
which was lying behind him in the shade. Bluey
grabbed him by the leg, and the parson jumped
up in haste and made for his horse —followed by
Bluey. Joe cried, “ Kurn ’ere ! ” then turned in-
side.
Mother and Sal entered. They had come to
make Dad and themselves a cup of tea. They
quarrelled with Joe, and he went out and started
playing with the snake. He let it go, and went
to catch it by the tail again, but the snake caught
him. —by the finger.
He’s bit me!” Joe cried, turning pale.
Mother screeched, and Sal bolted ofif for Dad,
while the snake glided silently up the yard.
Anderson, passing on his old bay mare, heard
the noise, and came in. He examined Joe’s
finger, bled the wound, and was bandaging the
arm when Dad rushed in.
‘Where is he?” he said. “Oh, you d
whelp ! You wretch of a boy ! My God ! ”
**Twasn’t my fault.” And Joe commenced to
blubber.
But Anderson protested. There was no time,
he said, to be lost barneying ; and he told Dad to
take Nell (his old mare) and go at once for
Sweeney. Sweeney was the publican at Kangaroo
Greek, with a reputation for curing snake-bite.
Dad ran out, mounted Nell, and turned her head
for Sweeney’s. But, at the sliprails, Nell stuck
him up, and wouldn’t go further. Dad hit her
between the ears with his fist, and got down and
ran back.
“The boy’ll be dead, Anderson!” he oried,
rushing inside again.
“'Come on then,” Anderson said—“ we’ll take
off his finger.”
Joe was looking drowsy. But when Anderson
took hold of him and placed the wounded finder
on a block, and Dad faced him with the hammer
and a blunt, rusty old chisel, he livened-up.
“No, Dad, no/” he squealed, straining and
kicking like an old man kangaroo.
stuck to him, though, and with Sal’s assistance
held his finger on the block till Dad carefully
rested the chisel on it and brought the hammer
down. It didn’t sever the finger—it only scraped
the nail off—but it did make Joe buck. He
struggled desperately and got away.
Anderson couldn’t run at all; Dad was little
faster ; Sal could run like a greyhound in her bare
feet, but before she could pull her boots off Joe
had disappeared in the corn.
“ Quick ! ” Dad shouted, and the trio followed
the patient. They hunted through the corn from
end to end, but found no trace of him. Night
came. The search continued. They oalled, and
called, but nought answered save the ghostly
echoes, the rustling of leaves, the slow, sonorous
notes of a distant bear, or the neighing of a horse
in the grass-paddock.
At midnight they gave up, and went home, and
sat inside and listened, and looked distracted.
While they sat, “ Whisky,” a blackfellow from
Billson’s station, dropped m. He was taking a
horse down to town for his boss, and asked
Dad if he could stay till morning. Dad said he
could. He slept in Dave’s bed ; Dave slept on
the sofa.
“If Joe ain’t dead, and wuz t’come in before
mornin’,” Dave said, “ there won’t be room for us
all.”
And before morning Joe did come in. He
entered stealthily by the back-door, and crawled
quietly into bed.
• » * *
At daybreak he awoke, and nudged his bed-
mate, and said: —
“Dave, the cocks has crowed !” No answer.
He nudged him again.
“ Dave, the hens is all off the roost! ” Still no
reply.
Daylight streamed in through the cracks. Joe
sat up—he was at the back—and stared about. He
glanced at the face of his bed-mate and chuckled
and said :
“ Who’s been blackenin’ y’, Dave ?”
He sat grinning awhile, then stood up, and
started pulling on his trousers, which lie drew
from under his pillow. He had put one leg into
them when his eyes rested on a pair of black feet
uncovered at the foot of the bed. He stared at
them and the black fane again—then plunged for
the door and fell. Whisky was awake and grinned
over the side of the bed at him.
“ Wot makit you so fritent like that?” he said,
grinning more.
Joe ran into mother’s room and dived in behind
her and Dad. Dad swore, and kicked Joe and
jammed him against the slabs with his heels,
saying:
“My Gawd! You devil of a feller, how (kink)
dare you (kick) run (kick), run (kick, kick, kick)
away yesterday, eh ? ” (kick).

“Melb.”: Why were the clergy absent
from “ General ” Booth’s monster meeting ? Here
is Gov. Brassey trumpeting the mighty religious
force of the Salvation Army, while the clergy, all
but Pastor Edgar, plainly indicate that they con-
sider it a hollow fraud, and he only made dark-
ness visible, with a constrained presence, as a sort
of mat for the Hebraic boot. Look at the humbug
of all this—the Clergy and Army hath each other
like poison. The oleaginous hypocrisy, as they
protrade a fishy paw with “ Ber-rother,” and the
aside, “He cops the coin.” Religion is asafeetida
in the nose of the world when it is all “on the
make,” a worry for baby - linen and Utrecht
carpets. ,
“C. 0.”: In a recent English breach-of-
promise case it was contended that the promise,
being 14 years old, was null and void as if under
a Statute of Limitations. But the fact was
ignored that even the most prosaic lover may be
calculated upon to renew his promise every day of
his engagement (every woman wants to be told
every day that she is loved), which brings the
possible renewals during the 14 years to 5000 odd.
Case recalls the Judge who refused to order the
return of the jilted man’s presents on the ground
that he could be said to have sold them for
caresses. Fair exchange no robbery ! But is the
exchange fair ? Is the pleasure of kissing limited
to the masculine participator ?
“Divorce proceedings have been insti-
tuted,” writes The Bulletin’s London correspon-
dent, “ against a lady (daughter of a Marquis)
and her giddy friend, an Earl, by the husband of
the former. Society is wildly interested over the
affair, for the respondent is a well-known beauty,
and sister to the wearer of a coronet who divorced
her husband some time ago. The case is one
which, for family reasons, will interest a certain
Australian Governor. The co-respondent is 25,
over 6ft., single, a master of hounds, and a very,
popular, well-known man. A hotel off Leicester
Square was watched by private detectives, the
guilty couple entered at 9 p.m. and had not left at
11 a.m. next day, when their room was forced and
the lady found hiding under her hanging skirts.
The male sinner accepted the ‘ finding - out ’
meekly, and powerful efforts are now being made
to prevent a public exposure.”
How to be Single, though
Married.
A philosophic and plain-spoken woman sends
Ihe Bulletin this amusing letter
When George and Cissy marry, why should it be
assumed that they must therefore live in the same house,
and be exceedingly much married for the term of their
unnatural lives ? Of course, for a Cissy it is perhaps the
least-worst thin? that may happen to her; but if she is
not a Cissy, and if George is not a common George !!
Now, there are more Georges inclined not to be George
than there are Cissies who are not Cissy.
Man is the Romantic Sex ; Woman only seems so, for
practical purposes. When a man marries he wants the
woman ; when a woman consents to be married, she
desires the furniture and the house and the “Mrs.”
to front her name with, and the prospective baby—all of
which are not decently reachable without the husband.
She likes the feeling of being chained down to these
things ; man doesn’t, and she hasn’t sense enough to take
the chained feeling off his mind. For men, on the whole,
are good-hearted. There’s many a husband would gladly
make love to his wife if he could only be persuaded there
was something Immoral about it. Just as a woman who
is illegally united will endeavor to give her union the ap-
pearance of respectability, so it is the duty of every
virtuous woman to give her marriage a decided flavor of
the Other Thing. These matters ought to be preached
from the pulpit, and when the world knows its way about
they will be.
It is said that we should be careful about our choice in
marriage, because marriage lasts so long—} 7 ou may live
30 years after marriage. On the other hand," you
may die the very day after ; there is always that to look
forward to. The curse of marriage is not its 1-ngth but
its breadth. It is not that you are married for so long,
but that you are so much married when you are married.
Marriage, which should bea thin, silver thread, irradiating
the dull woof of life, is now the dull woof itself, and we
have to look for our silver threads elsewhere. It is hope-
lessly vulgarised, and woman is the vulgariser.
No woman who respects herself will ever breakfast
with her'husband, neither will she walk out with him. '
When she wants to walk out with him very badly, she
will carefully choose another man—and bore him. The
wife who is performing her morning toilet in a state of
unpicturesque undress will calmly endure her husband’s
presence, but shriek if another man accidenta ly intrudes;
whereas the woman of the future will shriek at the hus-
band and mind the other fellow no more than if he were
a Chinaman.
Marriage is not a lottery. In a lottery you can throw
away the blanks. If marriage were but a temporary
affair, woman would get to look upon her husband as the
probable husband of another woman, and, being natur-
ally more afraid of sister-woman than of man, refuse to
be so dreadfully much married to him as she is at present.
Therefore, in the name of decency, let us be Immoral.
The conventional idea about marriage is that it is a
sacrament; but people will adduce the “sacre.luess of
marriage” as an argument against easy divorce, and then
give themselves away by triumphantly inquiring what
would become of the children ; thus proving that even in
their opinion marriage is really a question of utility.
The holiness of marriage simply rests on the scarcity of
tucker, if the old man manages to get away. Once make
the tucker secure, and the resultant instability of the
marriage-tie will be one of its chief charms. The people
that really like being severely chained-up can still go on
doing it for themselves.
The vice of faithfulness continues to stock the world
with stodgy and cold-hearted children, and the woman
who gives the world an unauthorised but healthy and
intelligent infant will long he regarded, curiously enough,
as its debtor—not its creditor. A baby is like a canary ;
it is etiquette to give a bag of feed along with
it; or, in the case of the baby, a guarantee as to feed in the
shape of a married and wage-earning father. Polygamy
looms in the possible future, and the prime reason why
we should have it is that we have it already. Neverthe-
less, men will be found to reprobate the present wicked
female scribe in between their cheerful talks about their
“ necessary sing.” Also, woman will do ditto, because
the average woman would rather know vaguely that her
husband is led astray by half-a-dozen Flossies that she is
not 'supposed to know anything about, than legally
married to another woman who is otherwise quite respect-
able. A modified' polygamy would well suit the Aus-
tralian branoh of the Anglo-Saxon race, because it would
never be practised for show purposes. It was that which
ruined it in the East. There, wives were largely for orna-
ment. Out of Solomon’s hundreds, many must have been
practically deadheads. And the Anglo-Saxon objects to
deadheads. >
Marriage should be absolutely free, subject to financial
considerations with respect to the wife and the children.
“ Judicial separation ” is a phrase that should be blotted
out of the dictionary of civilisation. The civic cure for
too-much marriage is—no marriage at all; a sudden stop-
page which is enough to throw the parties quite off the
rails of respectability, especially the party that is the
woman. The woman who takes a second husband when
her first is living is supposed to come under the wrath of
Heaven ; but, if Heaven is angry with her,Why doesn’t it
smash up the power which (if she is of average tempera-
ment) inflicts on her severe physical suffering if she
doesn’t take up with some man or other?

THE USEFULNESS AND CURATIVE VIRTUES OF
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People
CAN BE PROVED IN ONE DAY by making a few inquiries in your own neighborhood. There is probably no place in this country which does not contain strong healthy
active men and women who have been rescued from acute illness or chronic ill-health by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People. You will never hear of any good being effected by
a substitute ; but the great cures known to have been effected by the'genuine pills—Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People—are THE TALK OF NEARLY EVERY TOWN
CASES IN NEW SOUTH WALES.
A Blayney Lady’s Recovery.
(From the Blayney Advocate.)
Mrs. John Layland, of Blayney., has been cured by Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills after she had suffered for no less than 14 years
from Sciatica and Rheumatism. She told the Blayney Advocate
and Carcoar Herald reporter as follows :
SCIATICA. “ I suffered excruciating pains from rheu-
vuvmwivreiw matism in the arm—so bad that I could not
AtiH±iUraise my hand to my head. It affected my
arms from the shoulders to the finger-ends ; my hands were swelled
up, and 1 couldn’t move my fingers. I also had Sciatica in the left
leg and couldn’t walk about. A doctor was attending me, and
although he was very attentive, his medicines only gave me tefti-
I couldn’t walk about."
porary relief. I also tried euca-
lyptus and all kinds of patent
medicines, but got no benefit.
I was never entirely free from
pain, and I got that way that I
did not care what happened.
About eighteen months ago a
lady friend recommended me to
try Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.
At first I refused to give them
a trial, as I had spent such a lot
of money; but my friend at
last persuaded me to take them,
and thankful I am of it, for
after I had used a few boxes I
was thoroughly cured, and have
not had a pain since. I can
now get about and do my house-
work, and after the 14 years’
pain which I suffered the entire
cure made me feel like a new
woman altogether. The cure
must be permanent, as I went
through all last winter without
any pains. I have recommended the pills to many friends, and
can advise anyone suffering as I did to take them.”

A Hopeless Case.
In consequence of information received as to a recovery from
lung trouble and general weakness, experienced by Mr. M'Cann,
of 12 Cambridge-street, near Argyle Cut, Sydney, a reporter
waited on that gentleman to ascertain if the reports as to the
marvellous results achieved for him by Dr. Williams’Pink Pills
were correct. Mr. M‘Cann received the reporter cordially. “I

don’t think,” said he, “ that the reports are in
the least bit exaggerated. The pills are truly
w mderful, • and they pulled me through when I was in a very
perilous state, and when no other medicine was of any service. I
sank into a low feverish state, perhaps the result of a neglected
cold. I turned against my food, and; I could never sleep at night
properly, though I dozed heavily in the day. I got weaker every
day, and had to give up work of any kind. I grew most astonish-
ingly thin, and as pale as death. My friends said I looked like a dead
man trying to walk. At last the doctor said my lungs were affected.
He said I had bronchitis, and that unless I got over my weakness
and debility I should never throw it off. But his medicines couldn’t
give me the least appetite, and I continued fading away day by
AMONG THOUSANDS.
The interesting cases here mentioned are a few among
thousands in which the usefulness of DR. WILLIAMS’
PINK PILLS has been made known to the public.
They are famous among the highest and the lowest in the
land for the cure of Rheumatism, Sciatica, Indigestion,
Ancemia, Palpitation, and General Muscular Weakness.
They fire a splendid Nerve and Spinal Tonic, and have
cured many cases of Paralysis, Locomotor Ataxia, Neu-
ralgia, St. Vitus’Dance, and Nervous Headache. Sold
by all chemists, or sent post free by Dr. Williams’
Medicine Company, Queen’s Place, Sydney, at 2s. 9d. a

day. I was indeed a hopeless case, and my chances of recovery
seemed very remote. Then a friend asked me to read an account
of a cure which he pointed out to me in a newspaper. The case
seemed even worse than mine, and yet Dr. Williams* Pink Pills
had saved that person’s life. I could hardly believe it, but after
satisfying myself as to the truth of the paragraph, I sent for six
boxes of the pills. As I told you before, their effect was wonderful,
and it didn’t quite take the six boxes to put me on my feet again,
entirely cured. From the first day I started the pills I began to
get better; they gave me an appetite and permitted me to sleep,
thus permitting nature a free hand to throw off the disease. My
gratitude at my recovery is indeed great, and I have pleasure in
authorising the Dr. Williams’ Medicine 00. to publish my remarks
wherever they deem fit.”

11l for Two Years.
Mr. T. Cole, of Box Ridge, Sofala, N.S.W., heartily testifies to
the curative properties of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People.
Mr. Cole is about 43 years of age. He says :
“For the past 30 years I have been mining on the Turon River,
and one day about four years ago, whilst at work, and having to
work very hard, too, I felt very not, and thought I must come up
to the top of the mine and get some fresh air, the result being that
I caught a very severe cold. About a fortnight after I had caught
this heavy cold a red rash came out all over me, and for two or
three days at a time I would feel quite silly. I was beginning to
get rather alarmed, because I was getting worse every day, and I
thought I must do something and try and put me right.
I consulted a clever doctor, who prescribed for me but,
with no good result. I then tried some other medicines,

but they proved useless like the rest, and I made no improvement
whatever. At this time I had been ailing two years. One
day 1 was unusually bad, so mv mother said to me, “Why
not try Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills? They have done me good,
and I am sure they would also benefit you.” I acted upon
her good advice and commenced taking them. I must state that I
had to ride a distance of 20 miles to purchase them T but this I did
not mind if they would only cure me. I commenced with them,
but I did not feel any benefit until I had used two boxes, then, be-
lieving that they were doing me good, I continued with them, and
kept on taking them until I had finished seven boxes in all, after
which, lam pleased to say, that I felt quite well again. I have
been living in Sofala all my life-time, so, it is heedless to say, that
lam very well-known. AH the neighbors know of the amount of
good l)r. Williams’ Pink Pills have done me, and it always does,
and always will, give me the greatest pleasure to recommend them
to other poor sufferers. lam sure that they alone cured me, and I
feel that if I had not given them a fair trial I would not be as I am
to-day.”

A Pale Girl at Auburn.
Miss Rose Kennerdale, of Carnarvon-street, North Auburn, is
now a very pretty young lady ; formerly she was pale and pall’id.
A reporter calling upon her was told the following by Miss Kenner-
dale :
Miss Kenrierdale.
“ About 18 months ago I
found I was losing the good
health and spirits I had pre-
viously possessed. I became
quite pale and bloodless; it
seemed as if my blood was
being drained from me, and
I could
hardly lift

after the other ; I suffered
severely from headaches. The
hot weather tried me, for I
would feel the greatest lassi-
tude during the whole day. I
would toss about in bed at
night and would gasp for
breath, while to walk fast or
ascend a hill was simply tor-
ture. Sometimes after walk-
ing my heart would beat
alarmingly, and I would have to stand still for a few
moments with my hands to my sides to obtain a little
relief before making another start; I used to think I would
suffocate. I could eat nothing then, I can assure you. A doctor
told me I was suffering from anaemia, or bloodlessness, and that
I would have to undergo a course of treatment for six months.
I was under his care for some time, but I seemed to get little
better, and I began to despair. At last I bought two boxes of
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. You can understand my joy when,
after the second box, I found my health improving. My color
came back, and my headaches gradually ceased, and I shook off
that terrible languor. My appetite gradually returnedthe
strength returned to my limbs, and, instead of crawling about,
I was able to move briskly; work was no longer a burden. I
have taken eight boxes altogether, and my health has gone on
steadily improving. I certainly pin my faith on Dr. Williams'
Pink Pills, for they cured me.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Tis the Slave that makes the Tyrant—not the
Tyrant makes the Slave ;
Wherefore, O man, be fearless, be resolute and
brave !
Listen, ye Kings of Muscle—attend, ye Lords of
Mind
Accept no man’s credentials by God not counter-
signed ;
But question each one’s title and bid him prove
his right;'
Obey not yon proud upstart, who claims to rule
by might;
He has no strength or cunning, conferred by right
divine—
The power by which he ruleth, that power is yours
and mine.
It has grown but by the weakness of the senseless,
gaping hordes;
He is great but by the homage which a fawning
crowd accords.
Our grand old Mother Nature forms life on one
great plan—
One protoplasmic basis, one towering apex, Man.
She strips off gauds and titles, and brings us back
to dust ;
AH' men she makes as equals (and surely she is
just !) —
Not ninety-nine to labor, and one alone to rule ;
Not one per cent, of hero, and ninety-nine of fool!
The masterpiece of Nature, Creation’s lord and
crown,
Is Man when he has trodden every dark’ning
terror down.
’Tis Ignorance enthralls him, and Knowledge is
the key ;
And they must seek and strive and learn who ever
would be free.
“Be meek, and all inherit ” . . . No fouler-minted
lie
Was ever coined, to serve the ends of Fraud exalted
high.
What secret e’er was wrested, what conquest e’er
was bought,
But by bold, courageous effort, and by free, un-
fettered thought?
“Obey; resist not evil; be restful and con
tent! ” . . .
Self-meshed in these, ye struggle until all your
strength is spent.
Out, Sword of Truth, and sever these trammels of
the brain !
Shine, Lamp of Truth, and darkness shall ne’er
affright again!
Behold, through all the ages, sinoe e’er the world
began,
The bQndage and. the fetters that man has made
for man.
Each forges his own shackles—builds his own
prison cell,
Decrees his own damnation—invents his final
hell.
Ay, e’en the Heavenly Despot—hard, tyrannous,
austere
Exists but in man’s fancy and childlike “godly
fear.”
Awake, then, thou that sleepest! Great Demos,
wake and see 1
Fraternity, equality are thine wert thou but free.
In that one watchword, Freedom—the freedom of
the mind— i "
Behold the germ of Godhead for suffering human
kind.
Seek not, poor blinded Samson, to wreck the
t'-mple walls—
Come out into the light ! In time each hoary
structure falls.
Come out! Seek, know, inherit; regain the boon
of sight;
Make Earth a stately ground, and Life a
long delight ;
And, first, con well the lesson that is known to
every knave—
’Tis the Slave that makes the Tyrant—not the
Tyrant makes the Slave !

J. LIDDELL KELLY.
Kessler’s Sack.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the German Chartered Co. grabbed the
best part of Papua, and all the islands to the
northward, they intended to start colonising,
which, according to their notion of things, meant
simply the establishment of stations and the ap-
pointment of officials thereto, who would keep
things in order and deal with the influx of settlers.
But, alas ! the settlers never came, and all the
isolated officers had to do was to kill time-till
tune should kill them. ‘’Herein they were vastly
assisted by a thirst, originally made in Germany,
and flourishing exceedingly in new and propitious
surroundings which, together with occasional
fights, malaria, tinned-dog, scrub-itch, and random
visitations from headquarters, made up the routine
of life in German Papua.
Right between New Britain and New Ireland,
on a tiny little coral island named Kerawara,
there existed, about 10 years ago, a Government
station, dumped down into the exclusive forsaken-
ness of the archipelago. About a mile to the east
of it, on the sister isle Mioko, there was a trading
and recruiting establishment. On Kerawara,
Kessler vegetated as German Resident, and
a dull time he had of it, with no
oompany but his “boys” and the droning
s well of the Western Pacific on the outer reef
mingling soporifically with the rattling cocoa-palm
leaves, that sounded like the subdued explosion of
an endless string of Chinese crackers.
So Kessler felt very lonesome indeed, and as he
had absolutely no work to do, he fell into the
habit of running over regularly to Mioko on a
friendly sort of visit. He was a methodical man,
and carried order even unto pedantry. All things
had their time with him, and ran their predes-
tined course, even a spree. Thus he set forth, at
stated intervals, in a boat pulled by four stal-
wart Solomon boys, to the trader’s place, and, on
arrival, accepted with dignity a glass of lager.
After that the record of proceedings was usually
lost, bar perhaps what might be gathered
from the number of empty bottles and
the various labels thereon. But by four
o’clock a.m. sharp, Kessler would give one last
whoop for Fatherland, or the island gin, or some-
thing, and subside under the table, whither his
boon companion had already gone. Then the
boys would come in, carry him to the boat, row
home, and gently put him to bed, paying them-
selves for tlieir overtime with the tobacco that
their methodical master had deposited the day
before on the table for that purpose.
All went well till the powers at home sent out a
new Governor—an elderly gentleman, reared at
the desk and utterly opposed to the easy morals
of oversea officialdom.
Kessler joyfully set out one day on his consti-
tutional, and was, as usual, received with open
arms by the man on the other side.
The sun had gone down and the two were just
beginning to get warm, when from the beach came
the well-known cry, “ Sail ho ! ”
“Where is it? What is it?”
“ Steamer go long-a Kerawara.”
“ The devil ! That must be the mail.’
“ ’Tisn’t due for a week yet.”
“ Well, old man,” sighed Kessler, with a wistful
look at the bottles, “ I’ll have to go, anyhow.”
And, despite all dissuasion, off he went, taking
only as a consolation for his disappointment a
goodly number of unemptieds.
Up- at Kessler’s house on Kerawara sat his
Excellency, the new Governor of Kaiser Wilhelm’s
Land, with his staff and the captain of the
steamer. He had just arrived on a visit of in-
spection, and finding the Resident absent, dis-
patched a messenger to Mioko and settled down to
wait, enjoying the wondrous beauty and freshness
of the night.
Suddenly the breeze bore a faint noise over from
the water, and the Governor leant forward,
listening. Then he grew pale. As I said before,
his Excellency was a new chum.
“ What can it mean ? ” he faltered. “ Perhaps
the natives are trying ”
But he did not finish. With a yell that woke
the parrokeets overhead and blasted for the
moment all his ponderous dignity, he jumped
from his seat and stood staring into the outer
darkness. His companions started up too, puzzled
and nervous.
• There slowly, on the track from the landing, a
body of huge naked savages were carrying a
writhing, yelling human being, evidently a white
man. In the dim starlight they could see the
frantic struggles of the unfortunate victim, held
firmly by his jerking legs and arms, and as the
gruesome procession drew nearer they could hear
his terrible threats and whining entreaties. Some
mongrel dogs were running arouxid the group,
barking furiously. Night and imagination mani-
folded the number of dark-hued, grim-looking
savages, and struck dumb and motionless the
visitors as they watched the fearful procession
approach. .. 1 .
“Back into the house for your lives! ” yelled
the Governor. But it was too late. The mys-
terious caravan had gained the verandah, and the
house boy, lamp in hand, came out to meet them
in a business-like manner.
The visitors stood, spellbound, gasping.
“It is Kessler,” murmured the captain as the
miserable Resident was being ignominiously
carried into his bedroom, kicking, swearing, biting
and screaming. Then the Governor, with the
courage of despair, frantically waving a stone club
he had picked out of a trophy on the wall, bawled:
“Let him go, you scoundrels, or, by God, you’ll
be cut to mincement ! Here ! Help here ! Let
him go, I say.”
But the boys stuck to their work. “No fear,
me put him a-longa bed. He sick fellow, too
much drinkum rum. Me want him tobacco.”
And, as if to prove the truth of their assertion,
two old women came tottering up the verandah
steps, bowed down under loads of bottles, which
they carefully arrayed on the floor. Kessler had
been dumped down on the bed and his carriers had
disappeared, whensuddenly,instinctively, herecog-
nised the terrible Presence, and lay staring at his
Exoellency, while the captain and the others sim-
ply writhed about on the floor and roared. But
the Governor, whose dignity had returned two-
fold unto him, and whose temper the merriment
of his following didn’t make any sweeter, howled
for an explanation. And deluded Kessler started
to explain. He pointed out the impracticable
stupidity of the nigger who, being trained to
carry in a drunken German, had woodenly insisted
bn carrying in a sober one. He violently asserted
his present sobriety, and plaintively went on
relating the facts that had led to this regrettable
incident. Not till he had drawn, inferentially, a
pretty sombre picture of his usual condition did
he realise that his case was becoming blacker with
every new protestion.
Then his Excellency performed. Incredible!
Conduct utterly unbefitting a gentleman ! Fear-
ful example to set the natives. And—in short,
present suspension and prospective sack.
And, alas ! sack it was ! .

<f Sometime ago I was taken very ill, losing my appetite, could not sleep,
and was unable to do my work. I was attended by two doctors, but to no effect.
I became very thin and weak. Sometimes when I was out I would become so
ill that I would have to go into a neighbor’s house until I was fit to walk again.
I cannot describe my sufferings, only to say that this state of things lasted
for months.
“At last I remembered your advertisements in the papers, so determined to
try a bottle of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. Finding the first so beneficial, I took
another, and still another, and the three bottles completely put me to rights.
“I am now perfectly healthy and strong, and can eat and sleep and work
like a Trojan.”
This is the strong and clear testimonial of Mrs. Jane Messiter (whose
portrait is here given), of Foy St., Balmain, New South Wales.
It is because of the multitude of such cures that Ayer’s Sarsaparilla is called
“The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”
Ayer’s ”is unlike other sarsaparillas. It contains different medicines,
mres more quickly, acts more directly on the blood.
One bottle of “ Ayer’s ” does the work of three bottles of the ordinary kind.

Dear Sirs,—Being a sufferer for years from fibroid phthisis and bronchitis, I de-

cough, with much expectoration, I have found it to be the most effectual of anything
I have tried. It loosens the mucus, which, therefore, comes more readily away, and
the cough is thereby considerably pacified.
