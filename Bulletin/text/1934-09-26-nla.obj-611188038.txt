BOOKS
The Week’s Best :—
A TAPESTRY
OF THE
VOCAL POETS
Henceforth the
aim in this fore-
front of The
Bulletin will be
to present, in as
agreeable a man-
ner as may be, something of the color,
shape, size, intention and achievement of
the more arresting books of the moment:
not a regular discovering of master-
pieces, but simply an attempt to find, in
those several score weekly vanities that
are called Books, two or so that, at any
rate, are not despicable.
For a start, a romance with great
gusto of life in it; a racy, rich, opulent,
diverting period piece peopled with
troubadours, viols, halberds, wenches,
knights-errant, crusades, sackings, song,
drink, lechery and the earlier intentions
of Christianity; containing 400-odd
light-hearted pages of the author’s fine
prose and his leading character’s slender
songs, a glossary, a foreword, a table of
subsidiary characters, an introduction by
Eric Linklater, title The Fool of Venus,
subtitle “The Story of Peire Vidal,”
author George Cronyn, publisher Jona-
than Cape ; nine-and-sixpence the lot. It
covers 26 years, from 1187 onwards,
and moves from Provence to Marseille,
Italy, Venice, Crete, Cyprus, Constanti-
nople and back again. At that time a
king—Coeur de Lion was one (“I like
this king: he is not above petty lar-
ceny!”)—went on crusade accompanied
by one or two archbishops, a tub, a
sufficient supply of ladies, sundry vocal
poets, a hundred or so knights and a
determination to cut throats, stick giz-
zards, smash skulls, disembowel, dis-
member and destroy in the name of
God.
Barring the ladies, who nowadays
again approach sartorial sanity, all this
gorgeous train was decked out in a vast
variety of assorted impedimenta: guis-
arme, chausses, coif, estoc and the more
familiar trappings of mediaeval warfare.
Cluttered is the name for it, and it
tends to clutter up the story. Mr.
Cronyn is a more than ordinarily good
novelist, but he is also a scholar, and the
scholar in this matter impedes the novel-
ist. There is an almost academic abun-
dance of detail, to the point of being a
little tedious.
Nevertheless, in
the main he gets
a grand effect.
He makes live a
bold and lusty
period, amoral in
the sense that adultery was esteemed by
women as a virtue, coarse in its swine-
drunkenness. callous in its torturings
and throttlings, but robust, hearty and
brave : not more contemptible than any
other in mankind’s inglorious progres-
sion. Of such a period Mr. Cronyn
proves a dazzling historian, and his
story-telling has a niceness of sentiment,
dramatic at its peaks. There is a love-
story which his restraint ennobles: in
all else he writes with the brush of an
enthusiastic housepainter.
A SNIVELLING,
ABOMINABLE
LITTLE HERO
In the sense
that you may
slit sheep’s
throats through
the week and
emerge Hero from
the scrum on Saturday, the first-person
narrator is hero of Louis-Ferdinand
Celine’s Journey to the End of the Night
(Chalto and Windus ; Bs. 6d.). His name
is Ferdinand, and his character might
add that name to the language as syno-
nym for a nasty, snivelling, dirty little
human growth. Call it a Ferdinand!
The author, the book, its matter (a
most appropriate word) and its people
are the very antithesis of the Cronyn-
cwm-Vidal outlook, manner and accept-
ance of life. Gffine’s observations and
vocabulary sound and smell of the
midden ; of cancerous, befouled hideous-
ness ; horror, moil, filth and sickness ;
disease and dirt.
He might have read Cronyn and said:
“Yes, very pretty. A gorgeous piece of
tapestry. Look at it, as Mj. Linklater
sees it, billowing out in the wind. A
brave piece. Now let us. strip it away
and see what’s behind it. Let us look
at Life, Mr. Cronyn. Let us look into
the facts of existence. I am a doctor.
I will show you, my fine friend, what
is beneath the veneer of civilisation. I
will show you that there is an enormous
mass of people to whom life is a press-
ing horror. I will make you feel that
horror by turning over its sores for you.
1 will tell you that it is the aim and
necessity of the rich to hide and deny
the existence of ugliness, lest good
fellows like yourself revolt against them.
I will show you, as they live, the people
to whom the animals are superior. I
will show you how you do service to
the rich with your weavings of romance,
your gorgeous surface pieces. I will
tell you that a sunset is only an incred-
ible piece of tomfoolery. In short, my
friend, I will offer you material for
a philosophy of life, and if you like you
may call it Despair.”
And forthwith he proceeds on this
possibly debatable enterprise, He sets
up his Ferdinand, an eminently suitable
medium: a shrinking little coward, de-
void of a single admirable attribute a
smelly human fungus, without heart,
bowels, morals or scruples. This pretty
thing has to face up to war, to the
ordinary struggle of life, to Congo
jungle-nights, to the Ford-factory kind
of mass production, to practising as a
doctor in a Parisian slum, to the claims
of sexual appetite, to bodily hunger and
disease.
Gfiine watches all this with the de-
tachment o( a post-mortem lecturer.
He turns over relentlessly the re-
actions of his hero, and it is like turn-
ing a piercing light into the diseased
places of mankind. His vocabulary em-
braces possibly every word in the lan-
guage that has a relationship with filth.
An extraordinary book. The brains in
our Customs House will probably call
it immoral, and they will be right in this
sense, that it is a negation and a denial
of contemporary social conventions.
Overseas it has been likened to Rabelais.
Naturally. It does not need a Celine
to provoke that. Any little nincompoop
has only to burst out into profanity for
the name of Rabelais to be taken in
by another who had never read the Old
Master of Gusto. Nevertheless, Celine’s
is an extraordinary piece of work, a
fierce and penetrating criticism of the
social sum of things over these past 20
years.
A Meeting to
Drink Beer
The masculine,
or male, section
of the Fellow-
ship of Australian
Writers has had
a meeting to drink
beer. The invitation, or prospectus,
stated that there were to be no
speeches, which suggests optimism,
and there was to be no intoxication,
which implies a hopeless pessimism in
regard to the beer. There was to be
simply some drinking of beer and talk,
which runs counter to the “riotous
maxim” of Boswell that “Conversation
spoils drinking,” but which nicely rounds
off this unique document’s general ven-
tilation of that air of naivete and inno-
cence so characteristic of Australian
letters.
On the whole, the idea was a good
one. The bright lads of the Fellowship
would get together and drink beer, and
talk, and justify their existence. “Drink-
ing,” said Boswell, “is in reality an occu-
pation which employs a considerable
portion of the time of many people ; and
to conduct it in the most rational and
agreeable manner is one of the great arts
of living.” A social triumph ; justifica-
tion enough for the existence of anything,
and for such organisations as the Fellow-
ship of Writers the only possible one.
For to what else can they or do they
aspire than to social triumph? What
other excuse can they offer for their
existence? To gather round the latest
precious novelist and listen to his plati-
tudes, the most unread lady poet and
listen to her torturing the insipid darlings
of her little mind ; smirking and smil-
ing in an atmosphere of artificiality—
what else is there to any of these hollow
societies?
I bear them no ill will whatever. They
are not a subject for invective, they are
a spectacle for pity: the old in them
because some of these have shone in
the sun, and ’tis pity to see them so avid
of this candlelight; the young because
they have not learned what those old
have forgotten—this: that the process of
writing is the ultimate exposure of com-
munism, and writing is the business of
writers. The old should be left to the
candles: they are not tragic, they are
only pathetic. But surely it is a rank dis-
service to the young, if there be any-
thing in them at all, to gather them into
these simpering shams. If their old
were as honest as they are honored, or
if they had the faculty left to do it, they
could still cheat the Reaper of one good
deed. They could tell these innocents,
out of their own experience, that writing
is not done by attending fortnightjy meet-
ings of Fellowships; that it is done
single, solo, alone, or not at all ; that it
means work in a sense that a wharf-
lumper would shudder at; a miserable,
grinding, exacting, consuming occupa-
tion, practised in discomfort, unhealthy
—and glorious, of course.
That, it seems to me, is the one thing
that anybody who sets out to be a writer
has to understand. Nobody understands
it who accepts any so-called writers’
society on its presumptions. For these
things do presume. If they would admit
frankly to what they wholly are —strictly
social organisations—l could have no
quarrel with them. They won’t admit it.
They give themselves such sounding
names as Fellowship of Australian
Writers, and they presume to be insti-
gators of writing. They cannot instigate,
they never have instigated and they never
will instigate the dotting of an i, save on
the minutes of their futile meetings. They
can instigate the drinking of soup, and
even beer; they can get together and
enjoy each other’s polite behavior ; they
can patronise and lionise ; they have an
incredible capacity for listening to bad
verse ; they have adapted themselves to
sitting in draughty places ; in many pretty
social ways they are ornaments to society.
But writers —those pariahs of society—
what use to them? You might as well
try to improve the quality of pumpkins
by organising a society of cocoanuts.
There is no relationship, and there can
be none. For the writer, work, loneli-
ness, individualism: there is no escape
from it.
But there is, here, an indecent eager-
ness to seek such escape. It is not

CONTRACT BRIDGE —by Ena Burrows,
winner of the CULBERTSON CUP.
Written in simple form for novice and
experienced player. At all bookstalls and
newsagents 2/-, or posted direct from
“The Bulletin,” Id. extra.
peculiar to writers. In them it is simply
a manifestation of that custom we have
in this country of leaning up against
things. Neither is it evidenced only in
the variable musters of these Fellowship
affairs: there is evidence of it in plenty
in the work of many of these Fellowship
foregatherers. The eagerness to escape—
it is written large over the face of Aus-
tralian letters. I will put one simple test
and have done with it. On the spur of
this moment how many memorable
women characters can you recall from
your reading in Australian literature? I
can recall Mum Rudd. I make that a
test because, to my way of thinking,
that barrenness is symptomatic of a
national, characteristic, cowardly eager-
ness to escape.
The same eagerness, taking physical
shape, gives us our Fellowships and their
splendid social triumphs.
CECIL MANN.
Lobsters on
Silver Chains
It has become
the fashion to
regard advertis-
ing as some new
growth in rela-
tion to the arts,
but writers and artists have been
masters of it for centuries. The
French, of course, raised it to its
finest level. What else but adver-
tisement was the whole life of the dandy
Barbey d’Aurevilly? His most famous
feat was to walk through the boulevards
leading a lobster on a silver chain.
Baudelaire dyed his hair green, and
talked loudly in the cafes of having mur-
dered his father and roasted a baby.
Maurice Barres threatened to parade the
streets of Paris in the guise of primitive
man, and Gautier invited attention by
wearing a revolutionary red waistcoat in
troubled times.
Where the writer has not sought to
startle the bourgeois by his clothes or his
conduct, he has sought for unorthodox
opinions, used any material that seemed
likely to make a noise in the world.
There is little difference between Nietzsche
calling the Germans “the Chinese of
Europe” and Bernard Shaw declaring
that the British Isles are populated almost
exclusively by comic characters, between
Beyle-Stendhal talking of the fidelity of
woman as contrary to nature and Oscar
Wilde declaring that women represent
the triumph of matter over mind, “just
as men represent the triumph of mind
over morals.” When Nietzsche wrote
solemnly on the subject “Why I Am So
Wise” he was merely anticipating the
seriousness of Shaw when he discussed
his points of superiority to Shakspeare.
In England the youthful Reynolds, re-
turning to England from Italy, elevated
his prices for portraits to the level of his
old master, rented impressive chambers,
purchased that famous second-hand
municipal coach, had it regilded and set
his sister to drive up and down in it all
day. The young Disraeli, setting out on
his conquest of London, wore “a coat of
black velvet, poppy-colored trousers
broidered with gold, a scarlet waistcoat
and sparkling rings worn on top of white
kid gloves.”
A close second to Israel has been Ire-
land. Wilde is the most notable example.
His sunflowers, velvet knickers, carefully
polished epigrams and mannered writing
all fitted into the perfect advertisement
for the man he considered to be the per-
fect artist. Shaw was more primitive in
method, and used tactics which he later
described as “banging the big drum”:
I first caught the ear of the British
public on a cart in Hyde Park to the blar-
ing of brass bands, and this not at all
as a reluctant sacrifice of my instincts of
privacy to political necessity... .When an
actress writes her memoirs she impresses
on you ip every chapter how cruelly it
tried her feelings to exhibit her person to
the public gaze ; but she does not forget
to decorate the book with a dozen por-
traits of herself.
In short, the exhibitionist tendencies
of man, the desire for display, are never
more obvious than in the artist.
QUENTIN POPE.
The Folly
of Being
“International”
“If the films
are to become en-
tertainment for
intelligent people
they must be-
c o m e interna-
tional,” said “10-2-4” (B. 5/9/’34). And
he went on to advise Australian pro-
ducers to make films that would appeal
to the whole English-speaking world.
If Beethoven had created with an eye
on the universal appeal he would have
had to compose music that conformed to
Italian prejudice, French taste, Russian
fancy, English preference and American
fashions of the time. As the Italian
taste was for decadent opera of the
worst Italian school, the French for a
conventional classicism, the English for
something else again, and so forth and
so on, the result would have been the
most horrible artistic abortion it is pos-
sible to conceive. Beethoven, of course,
did nothing of the sort. He endeavored
to produce music that expressed his own
criterion of what was beautiful, and his
criterion of beauty was so strange and
so far ahead of his times that it appeared
incomprehensible to most of his contem-
poraries, even in Germany, and to the
average Italian it sounded horrible.
If Shakspeare had attempted to do the
same thing the results would have been
equally bad. As a matter of fact, he
gauged international taste so badly that
the French did not understand him, and
years afterwards even Voltaire regarded
him as a barbarian, though a talented
one. The Italians of his time would
simply have regarded him as an ill-bred
incompetent.
If Rembrandt had tried to produce
paintings with an international appeal he
would have had a hard task. The Italian
taste of the time was for mawkish
Madonnas with dropsical Bambinos on
their knees. He went to Italy to learn
something, and was so disgusted with
what he saw that he returned determined
to find out what things looked like for
himself. He succeeded so well that the
world thought he was of no significance
whatever until Sir Joshua Reynolds told
the British public 150 years later that he
was one of the great painters of all time.
In short, national fashions vary enor-
mously, not only from place to place,
but from time to time. They are not
founded on intelligence, but on passing
enthusiasms for the meretricious and the
false. Nevertheless, the films with the
most interest for intelligent people are
intensely national in another sense.
These are the racketeer, gangster and
suchlike films, pictures produced by men
who are first-class reporters of the actual
events in the life around them.
So Australian producers would be well
advised to ignore “10-2-4’s” advice. Let
them put down the life around them and
not bother a damn about international
appeal. That will come automatically
if they do the job as well as some of
the film-journalists of Hollywood.
M.G.S.
Of the Bells
of Camden
The first time I
heard Camden
bells I felt sure
Parson Paul had
invited the Syd-
ney Post Office
to stay with him. The noise harrowed
me, because I had been led to expect
the Sunday tintinnabulation of a village
belfry in England—but here was Big
Ben in the wilderness! so that I imag-
ined the air about the tower like cracked
glass, on account of the constant collision
of quarters, and wondered each midday
hour, at the twelfth stroke, the whole
fabric hadn’t fallen to pieces—though
without respite, since some tinker’s saint
or angel would be certain to mend it
up again.
Yet it is possible that the tintinnabula-
tion my friend had prophesied might
have been worse, as witness Moritz, “a
literary gentleman of Berlin” (1782).
walking over England, who heard miser-
able little bells at Ruddington, Bradmore,
Bunny and Castol. He says, “I listened
to them this whole afternoon. It was
cloudy weather, and I felt myself not
at all well; and [O kindly, excusatory
sentence! ] in these circumstances the
ringing discomposed me, and made me
at length quite low-spirited and melan-
choly.” Afterwards he became still more
deeply dumped by stopping the night at
a shabby inn, “where there was only
the landlady, a sick butcher and a sick
carter” —all ill of the bells, no doubt.
In old times bells were given names,
as those in Croyland Abbey: Guthlac,
Bartholomew, Bertelin, Turketule, Tol-
win, Pega and Bega. Nowadays, we of
Camden still call bells names, but these
would be unprintable.
Feodor L, the last Russian prince of
the race of Rurik, passed the 11 years
of his inglorious reign in bell-ringing,
if this be true, 1 suppose that dining-
room waiters of his day were as inatten-
tive to him as those of our own genera-
tion are to us in 1934.
St. Anthony, in an early edition of
Martial, is done in wood, having a bell
in each hand. Thank God he wasn’t
centimanual!
This much against bells. Let Cenalis,
Bishop of Avranches, say something for
them.
Cenalis counted bells among the signs
of the true church ; the French Protes-
tants, not being allowed them, fired a
gun as a service signal, upon which this
prelate remarks: “Bells chime; muskets
pop off. Bells sing sweetly in the ear ;
muskets split the tympanum. To the
music of bells all heaven opens ; to the
crackling of muskets hell itself does the
same. Bells charm away thunderclouds,
while muskets obscure the universe with
smoke and flash their false lightning.”
HUGH McCRAE.
A Choice of Verse: —
THE MAIZE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Out of the maize she came,
Lipping a wild, strange song,
And her hair was a flame
Trailing the grass along.
Green were her eyes as weed
Of the seawash at dawn,
As she slipped li\e a reed
Slim from the tasselled corn.
"Maid of the burnished hair,
What does your wild song mean?
Why do your green eyes stare
Wide as a treeless scene?"
“Singer, do you not hear
The ominous thunder?’
Her voice rose to the clear
Sheer summits of wonder.
Into the maize she fled,
Flashing a lifted hand, .
And the flame of her head
San\ li\e a burning brand.
Only the gleaming corn
Knows where the singer bides;
Harf! from the hills a horn —
Is it there that she hides?

A Satchel of Books
Latest in Philip Allan’s “Horrors,”
“Terrors” series is Veils of Fear, by
Vivian Meik (2s. 6d.). It concerns the
discomfiture and overthrow of a “kind
of freemasonry of hell,” and moves
from London to the Indo-Tibetan border,
to the islands of the South China Sea
and to a finish at the headquarters of a
Hong Kong tong. Souls are disem-
bodied, the figures in photographs
struggle to escape and one of the charac-
ters “suffers the torments of hell — for
seventeen days.” Reviewers have to
read this kind of thing ; others have an
option.
Much of Steele Rudd’s Green Grey
Homestead (Macquarie Head Press ; 4s.
6d.) appeared originally in The Bulle-
tin. The stories have now been linked
together to recount the experiences of
Dick Gall in establishing his little home-
stead on the Darling Downs. The link-
ing has been well done ; there is no halt-
ing of the story, nor is there any of the
rough burlesque that characterised this
author’s earlier books. It leaves an im-
pression of personal reminiscence, and
the device of placing the reader in the
position of Dick Gall has the effect, when
one has grown accustomed to it, of
heightening the reality.
The escapes of McLean of Scotland
Yard in his pursuit of the international
master-spy “K” are the subject of
George Gopdchild’s latest thriller,
McLean Plays a Hand (Ward, Lock and
Co. ; 3s. 6d.). Called in to assist the
Secret Service in clearing up mysterious
thefts of important State documents,
Detective-Inspector McLean and his off-
sider, Sgt. Brook, unearth a series of
slender clues. The defeat of the satur-
nine “K” and his gang involves lightning
dashes by car and ’plane all over Eng-
land and the Continent. There is no
heroine, McLean being one of those
stout fellows who never for a moment
deviate from the thorny path of strict
business.
The turf figures prominently in the
latest batch from Philip Allan’s 2s. 6d.
Library. J. Fairfax-Blakeborough and
Rupert St. Cloud have collaborated in
Flying Cloud and A Turf Mystery, and
Blakeborough alone is responsible for
Warned Off. A Turf Mystery is the most
ambitious of the three. Colonel Bellew,
V.C., a cavalry leader in the Great War
and now one of “those who were not very
particular how they got hold of money
on the turf, so long as money came their
way,” loses everything when a ramp goes
wrong. He accepts a post under the
beautiful Princess Zonia Aralo-Riazan
and goes to Rubania, a Balkan republic,
ostensibly to lay out a racecourse, but
really to steal some papers. The future
of the kingdom of Scythia and the peace
of Europe depend on his success. He
gets the papers and gives them to Zonia,
but whether Scythia is saved, or whether
Zonia, whom he loves, is ever to see him
again is left to the reader’s imagination.

LUCKY JOE.
To the Manchester “Guardian” it seems
that Mr. Lang “bored” Australians with
his attacks on the banks, and that Mr.
Lyons was returned “mainly because he
was considered safe and harmless.” This
is the cold truth, but the Melbourne
“Argus,” which all its life has denounced
the things for which M r. Lyons stood most
of his political life, protests that it is a
Foul Libel on a Great Man:
Mr. Lyons is a persuasive exponent of
policy and a powerful opponent of dan-
gerous doctrine. After an arduous period
of prudent, capable and honorable adminis-
tration, he has earned the deep gratitude
of Australia. The influence of his personal
appeal has been strong and wide.
Another old enemy, the Sydney
“Herald,” is almost as enthusiastic:
He led the country out of the depression.
The response of the country was to him
personally and to his appeal.
This when the Lyons party had lost
its majority, and when three of the five
Lyons men in his own State, one a Min-
ister, were evidently losing their seats!
Other Labor-socialists have discovered
that Australia is a land of opportunity
for politicians who know just when to
change sides. None has been as fortu-
nate as Mr. Lyons, though Mr. Pearce
may not agree.
A defeated Labor leader at the Tas.
elections in 1928, Mr. Lyons, as the
sequel has proved, would have been
out of office for six years had he re-
mained in local politics. He decided to
stand for the House of Reps. His pros-
pects at first were far from rosy, for
Federal Wilmot had never gone Labor ;
but with the swift onset of the depres-
sion there was a great swing to his party,
and the end of 1929 found Mr. Lyons
at Canberra. By a second happy acci-
dent the victorious Caucus was short of
men with administrative .experience,
Federal Labor having been out of office
since 1916 ; so Mr. Lyons was voted into
the Ministry and given a minor portfolio.
By another series of happy accidents he
was appointed to the Treasury as deputy
for Mr. Theodore ; that gentleman had
had to give up the office for a time,
and the Prime Minister and Ministers
Brennan and Moloney (“Brennan and
Moloney concur”) had gone abroad.
Events moved fast. The predominant
clique in the Caucus demanded that
Commonwealth loans falling due should
not be met and that the Com-
monwealth Bank Board should be
ordered to inflate the currency. Mr.
Lyons, backed up by Mr. Fenton, the
Minister for Customs, refused to comply
with the ultimatum ; and it will always
stand to their credit, though one has been
ill-requited, while the other has been re-
warded beyond his deserts.
By this time the party in office was
obviously going to pieces. Its dissolu-
tion was hastened by the hostility of
the Senate and the advent of a wild State
Labor Ministry at Sydney. Mr. Lyons
and Mr. Fenton resigned from the Min-
istry and were followed out of the
Caucus by Messrs. Guy, Price, McGrath
and Gabb. Vague dissatisfaction with
the Nationalists led to the formation of
the All-for-Australia League, whose
slogan was “Someone ought to rise up
and do something,” and whose leg was
just itching to be pulled. After weeks
of hysteria, during which it rained
A.F.A.L. badges, the All-for-Australians
were persuaded that they wanted Mr.
Lyons to lead them. Mr. Lyons was
agreeable, and Mr. Latham, the Nat.
leader, who had other ambitions, was
willing to stand aside for Mr. Lyons. A
combination of the Nat. Federation and
the A.F.A.L. was arranged, the A.F.A.L.
disappeared, and the U.A.P. stole into
existence.
Mr. Lang bounded on the stage in his
Startling Default turn. Encored (by him-
self) he appeared in his Sensational
Bank-smashing performance. The Scul-.
lin Government, now reduced to the last
stage of drivelling futility, fell. The sub-
sequent election was a cakewalk for the
U.A.P. and the C.P., then supposed to
be allied with it. Mr. Lyons became
Prime Minister, the first from a small
State, with the greatest House of Repre-
sentatives majority on record.
A few rather exciting months were
spent in settling the hash of Mr. Lang.
Followed two years or so of “prudent,
capable and honorable administration,”
during which the secession agitation,
at which Westralians had previously
laughed, forced itself on Mr. Lyons’s
notice. Declaring himself a champion
of the small States he descended on the
West tp scotch it. “The influence of his
personal appeal” was “so strong and
wide” that the secession referendum was
carried by just on 2 to 1.
In other respects Mr. Lyons’s luck
stuck to him. One after another dan-
gerous rivals were removed from his
path or removed themselves. A con-
spicuously able Bank Board handled
loans and deficits. The price of wool
went up sixpence a pound in a season.
The British war-debt moratorium was ex-
tended indefinitely. Lyons and co. were
thus enabled to show substantial annual
surpluses while State Governments, no
more extravagant, had deficits totalling
£8,000,000. When the time came for
another election, the two Labor factions
went crazy again, demanded political
control of currency and banking (thereby
reminding every elector of the Savings
Bank smash) and were licked again, as
was inevitable, though Mr. Fenton and
Mr. Guy suffered.
So Mr. Lyons, who, though a model
of the domestic virtues, is as common-
place a politician as ever mouthed a
platitude, enters upon another term as
head of a Government in which his prin-
cipal coadjutors are duller than himself.
He has a better Nationalist press than Mr.
Bruce had, and even the Labor press is
far less unkind to him than it was to
Mr. Hughes. He is so sure of the sup-
port of his old enemies, who were con-
scriptionists to a man, that he can even
complacently recall that he “led the anti-
conscription forces during the war,” and
let one of his tame Ministers say that his
Government will never reintroduce com-
pulsory training.
If Mr. Lyons ever tires of politics he
could make a first-class living selling
lottery tickets on commission. Mr.
Whiddon and Lucky Fred would never
be able to compete with Lucky Joe.
GARDEN, M.P. (?)
The Sydney electorate of Cook has re-
jected its Labor member, Edward Riley,
in favor of a Langster, John Smith
Garden. It is no credit to the constitu-
ency to discard a Digger who has served
it well and been faithful to our Aus-
tralian institutions for a Moscow pilgrim
who has sought to bring them down and
establish Russian Communism on the
ruins; (rnt in ordinary circumstances its
right of choice would be respected. As
it happens, the circumstances are not
ordinary ; they are such as to raise the
question whether the new member
should be allowed to sit and vote in the
Australian Parliament, which, alderman
though he may be, is very different from
the Sydney Town Haul.
In a pre-election pamphlet issued by a
Sydney printer, perhaps at the instance
of the U.A.P., “Mr. Garden’s own state-
ment to the ‘Daily Telegraph’ ” was
quoted:
I am a Bolshevik. I prefer Russian
methods to Australian methods, and I am
looking forward to the day when the Rus-
sian scheme of things will be established
in Australia.
No date is given, but this outburst
accords with other utterances of Garden
when he gloried in being a Communist.
For years he was the head and front
(front in particular) of “the Communist
party of Australia.” He figured as pub-
lisher of the “Communist” newspaper,
which, in its poison-gas attacks on the
British Commonwealth of Nations,
struck at what it called “the procession
of pimps, harlots and criminal lunatics
that have occupied the throne [of Eng-
land] since the Norman Conquest”:
The King of England differs from the
Czar, who was a cold-blooded criminal, in
that he is entirely useless as a ruler. He
is a superfluity, an ornament, a mouth-
piece, a mere decoration... .He has fallen
as low as it is possible for a king to fall.
To fall lower would be to cease to be a
king and become a jester.
The publisher of this diatribe will now
have to “swear” or “solemnly and sin-
cerely affirm and declare” (if he can do
it without his tongue bursting through
his cheek) that he “will be faithful and
bear true allegiance to his Majesty King
George, his heirs and successors accord-
ing to law.”
It was after the attack on the King
that the publisher of the “Communist”
went to Moscow. There he attended the
fourth World Congress of the Commun-
ist International, and boasted in a speech
that “the Communist party has full con-
trol of the executive of the Labor Coun-
cil of N. S. Wales” (of which he was and
is secretary); that “out of 12 members
of the executive 11 are members of the
Communist party, and they direct 120
unions and the policy of each union,”
and that “ ‘we’ changed the objective of
the Labor party to socialisation of in-
dustry by revolutionary political and in-
dustrial action.” Along with Zinoviev
(chairman), “23 members and 10 substi-
tutes,” he was appointed to the executive
committee of the Communist Inter-
national.
On his return to Australia there
was a conference of “all societies in
Sydney acting on behalf of Technical
Aid for Soviet Russia.”
The conference decided, after hearing
the report of Comrade Garden, Executive
Member of the Comintern, to form a
Central Bureau in Australia... .Comrade
Garden notified the conference that it was
the instruction of Soviet Russia that only
one Central Bureau be formed in each
country, which will be in constant contact
with Soviet Russia. He would report the
formation of the Bureau to headquarters.
With the subsequent history of Com-
rade Garden Australians are only too
familiar. His Communist party was
already “affiliated to the Communist In-
ternational” and “listed as Comintern’s
Australian Section” (in effect, gathered
“under the banner of the Third Inter-
national in the revolutionary struggle for
power and the Dictatorship of the Pro-
letariat”) ; his Trades and Labor Council
joined the Red International of Labor
Unions. He took part in every strike
which had a revolutionary complexion,
notably the timbermen’s strike against a
Commonwealth Arbitration Court award,
notorious for the performances of the
basher gang. He stood as a Communist
candidate for Sydney at the Assembly
election of 1925 —and nearly lost his
deposit.
That experience doubtless convinced
the gentleman that there was no future
in this “backward country” (his own ex-
pression) for the Communist party. The
executive committee of the Communist
International had counselled its members
“to join the Federal Labor party and the
State Labor party.” The door of Fed-
eral Labor was locked, bolted and barred
against him. That of State Labor was
wide open. He entered, remoulded the
policy and objective to his heart’s desire,
hailed the vain Lang as “a greater than
Lenin,” and becomes Lang-Labor mem-
ber for Cook.
The founders of the Commonwealth
overlooked many things, but they were
alive to the fact that Australia had at-
tractions for overseas emigrants, and
would need guarantees from such as
might aspire to enter Parliament. So
they inserted these sections in the Con-
stitution:—
44. —Any person who (1) is under any
acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience
or adherence to a foreign Power, or is a
subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights
or privileges of a subject or a citizen of a
foreign Power shall be incapable of
being chosen or of sitting as a Senator or
a member of the House of Representa-
tives.
45. —lf a Senator or member... .(1) be-
comes subject to any of the disabilities
mentioned... .his place shall thereupon be-
come vacant.
46. Any person declared by this
Constitution to be incapable of sitting as a
Senator or as a member... .shall, for every
day on which he so sits, be liable to pay
the sum of one hundred pounds to any
person who sues for it.
And under section 47 “any question
respecting the qualification of a Senator
or of a member shall be determined by
the House in which the question arises.”
“Under any acknowledgment of obedi-
ence” is a very elastic expression, and
the House may interpret it as the majo-
rity pleases. It also has full power to
expel a member who has published an
insult to the King; it expelled the late
Hugh Mahon for an impersonal attack
on the Empire, although Mahon had
been an original member and three times
a Minister, and had had sons in the A.I.F.
Its “powers, privileges and immunities”
are those of the House of Commons.
Even so, it might not be able to prevent
the member for Cook from taking the
oath or affirmation, which has to be
“made and subscribed before the Gover-
nor-General, or some person authorised
by him” ; but it can and should refuse
to let him take his seat until he (1) with-
draws and apologises (to the sovereign,
the Parliament and the people) for his
tirade against the King, and (2) satisfies
it that he is not “under any acknowledg-
ment of allegiance, obedience or adher-
ence” to “headquarters,” and is not “en-
titled to the rights and privileges of a
subject or a citizen of a foreign Power.”
If the House fails in the second duty,
it is open to any loyal citizen to test the
matter bv sum? in “any court of com-
petent jurisdiction.”
WHITHER THE FILMS?
An American organisation, the Legion
of Decency, has started an agitation
against film salacity. Though the Legion
is composed of Catholics, Rome hasn’t
entered the fray officially—yet. Holly-
wood publicity methods will be to blame
if it does enter.
Ever since the screen first broke into
inhuman speech some seven years ago.
films have been growing increasingly por-
nographic. It is a recognised business
principle that any form of pornography
sells up to a point. The talkie bosses
have made millions out of it. They capi-
talised vice with remarkable cleverness
in the early stages. Promiscuity themes
were interpreted by stars who had been
ballyhooed as promiscuous.
Gloria Scrumptious, it was said, had
had five husbands and many lovers. How
appropriate that this exquisite ensnarer
of men’s souls and bodies should portray
the sensuous heroine of “The Unmarried
Mother”! The film magazines, which
form a large proportion of America’s
export trade in literature, were sedu-
lously fed with stories of lovely Joan
Lechery’s romantic trip to Paris with her
producer (resulting in the producer’s
fourth divorce); also with stories of the
public row between George Filbert, the
maidens’ idol, and gorgeous Gus Unstable
over Greta Nude—the star who made her
name in “Palm Beach Magdalen,” before
divorcing her third husband to become
the fifth wife of the Due de Gigole.
Half-witted youths and girls lapped up
this rubbish wherever the English lan-
guage was spoken, and yearned to live
the free, glamorous lives of their film
heroes and heroines.
Not till the recent break between Mary
Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks did the
ballyhoo-merchants begin to suspect that
their public was getting a little sick of
Hollywood divorces. But divorces between
film stars, however elderly, had by this
time become “news.” Last week the fact
that Ruth Chatterton, who is approach-
ing 50, had decided to divorce George
Brent, who is about the same age, was
cabled all over the world.
Last year, simultaneously with a
glut of films glorifying murderers, the
world was offered English comedies such
as “Design for Living,” which is about
a lady who first cohabits alternately with
two girlish lads and then leaves her ab-
surd old husband to cohabit with both
lads. The dialogue of these entertain-
ments is studded with the kind of quips
that got papers like the “Pink ’Un” pro-
secuted in the pre-talkie era.
At the time of writing Sydney is being
offered (1) a drama whose hero gang-
ster commits two cold-blooded mur-
ders, and (2) a musical play in which
one of the ladies, to quote the “S. M.
Herald,” “sets a new standard in decol-
lelage”—i.e., uncovers parts of her anat-
omy which have never before been un-
covered on screen or stage for the benefit
of an English-speaking audience.
Two sections are interested. Adult
talkie-addicts know what to expect when
they go to a picture palace, and, judging
by the crowds, they like what they get.
Whether they will go on liking it for
much longer is another question. No-
thing palls like smut in the long run.
The second section, which is equally big,
consists of those who wouldn’t be seen
dead at films like “Manhattan Melo-
drama” and “Murder at the Vanities” ;
and these people have their rights.
A stage has been reached when they
can’t take their offspring for a walk with-
out being confronted by hoardings on
which exotics and erotics are shown being
mauled about on sofas and rugs, while
near by hordes of ballet-girls kick
their legs in various stages of un-
dress. And puritanical parents can’t
pick up an evening paper without finding
the same affronts to their principles re-
peated on the advertisement pages. “It’s
a free country,” according to the cant
phrase ; but, of course, it isn’t. If it
were, nudist colonies wouldn’t have to
keep to enclosed spaces, and there would
be no need for beach inspectors. Jokes
that are welcomed in smoking-rooms
might lead to violent assaults in trams,
and films emphasising the morality
of assassination which would be thought
funny by a scientific audience might
scandalise many members of a talkie
audience.
The real offence of the films is not
that their vulgarities and indecencies cor-
rupt those who frequent talkies, but that
they outrage the susceptibilities of people
who know little or nothing of the talkies
but what is forced on them and theirs in
the form of salacious advertisements and
publicity stuff. Owing to these abuses a
formidable body of hostile opinion has
been mobilised, not only in the U.S.A.,
but in other countries, including Aus-
tralia ; and if the controllers of the busi-
ness don’t mend their manners something
disastrous is certainly going to happen
to them.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Joe Loses Jim.
A heartless electorate, Bass, has torn
Mr. James Allan Guy from the Prime
Minister’s side. It is a felon blow, for
the pair have been as brothers in politics
for nearly 19 years.
Joseph entered the Tas. Assembly —
as a Labor member, of course —in April,
1909, James in March, 1916. Shoulder
to shoulder they fought the hosts of con-
scription and denounced the apostasy of
John Earle (in 1916) and Jim Ogden (in
1926). Joe, called to the Premiership in
October, 1923, named Jim Chief Secre-
tary and Minister of Mines, then Minis-
ter of Railways, then Acting Premier;
reduced to the leadership of the Oppo-
sition by the victory of the loathsome
Nationalists in June, 1928, Joe made Jim
deputy leader.
Together the interesting pair resigned
from the State Parliament in September,
1929; together they stood for Federal
seats, went to Canberra, entered the
Scullin-Labor Caucus, walked out of it
and into the U.A.P. Jim was not in the
Labor Government with Joe, but when
Joe became the U.A.P. Prime Minister
he put Jim into the Ministry as soon as
he could. And now a cruel fate has
severed them!
Every effort was made to avert the
catastrophe. A cheque for the Com-
monwealth bounty to fruitgrowers (paid
piecemeal in 1933-34) arrived before
polling-day ; a churlish Labor Govern-
ment having inconveniently growled,
the “permitted” State deficit was in-
creased from £20,000 to £246,000 ; elec-
tors were earnestly reminded that Com-
monwealth payments to Tasmania
(£986,000) would be more this election
year “than the State has received from
any other Government in the history of
Federation.” Nor was this all. As the
Prime Minister said eloquently at Laun-
ceston the night before the election:
Very shortly there will be a fast, up-
to-date steamship service between North-
ern Tasmania and the mainland. Within
the next 12 months Tasmania will be
linked by telephone with the rest of Aus-
tralia and the rest of the world. That
same submarine telephone line, together
with a regional broadcasting station to be
erected, will enable Tasmanian listeners to
hear not only their own very excellent
radio programmes but the best pro-
grammes from the other States. And perma-
nent exemption of Tasmania from the pro-
visions of the Navigation Act will be given
full consideration immediately the new Par-
liament meets. Finally, there will be in-
augurated shortly one of the most up-to-
date aeroplane services in the world, with
a regular air mail and passenger service
between Melbourne and Hobart and inter-
mediate towns, running six days of the
week.
Joe even reminded Jim’s electorate that
he had “led the anti-conscription forces
during the war,” and Jim assured it that
Joe’s Ministry would never permit com-
pulsory military training of youth. And
it was all unavailing. Jim was beaten
by a member of his old party —and Joe’s.
How sharper than a serpent’s tooth it
is to have a thankless constituency !

“Hopeless, Broken Men.”
A branch secretary of the Diggers’
League writes to The Bulletin from a
town just south of the Queensland
border: —
The number of returned soldiers on the
track is heart-rending. A large proportion
are Anzacs with medals. Many can still
summon up the old Digger grin, but they
are just drifting—becoming hopeless,
broken men. Something will have to be
done about it.
Unquestionably it will. These Govern-
ments of ours, U.A.P. in particular (since
the U.A.P. controls the Commonwealth
and the two biggest States), must be
shamed out of their complacent attitude
that when they are in office all is for the
best in the best of all worlds. Had the
Empire gone under, Australia would
have been grabbed by the conqueror, and
would, no doubt, have become the
theatre of worse outrages than have been
committed in Germany this last twelve-
month, at the expense of the Jews and
of opponents of the existing regime. The
plight of so many of the men who saved
it from such a fate is a blot on the repu-
tation of Governments and a reproach
to the nation.
Honest application of Returned-sol-
dier Preference Acts would help. While
they remain on the Statute Book these
measures should be enforced, but Gov-
ernments are the first to flout them. In
N. S. Wales every week or so it leaks
out that a returned soldier has been
sacked from some department and a
non-starter kept on, or that a returned-
soldier candidate for some semi-Govern-
ment position, though his qualifications
are unexceptionable, has been turned
down in favor of some person who
never served. War nurses are also suf-
ferers in the fierce competition for jobs.
Unfortunately the U.A.P. tends to
pass under the control of gentlemen who
were not present at the war and who,
though goodwill may exist, cannot
imagine what the A.I.F. went through or
how much distressed survivors of it
need the nation’s help. It has also come
under the influence of vote-catching
politicians who continue the Scullin-
Labor ban on the military training of
youth because the reintroduction of the
old system would give offence in some
quarters. It is impossible to believe
that returned-soldier Ministers sub-
scribe to this ignoble policy, but re-
turned-soldier Ministers are few and
their influence seems to be negligible,
though there is a strong body of Digger-
members who should assert themselves.
The Lyons Government talks vaguely
of setting up another department “to
deal with the unemployed.” Let it in-
stead get on with its neglected job of
providing proper defences. Revival of
military training would at least give some
occupation to idle youth, and no one
would object to paying unemployed lads
for time spent on drill grounds and in
camps of instruction. Moreover, in the
strengthening of the A.M.F., the R.A.N.
and the air force, and in the establishing
of military posts in exposed parts of the
Commonwealth, a large number of re-
turned soldiers could be honorably and
usefully employed. And prematurely-
aged ex-soldiers, ex-seamen and war-
nurses who are past regular work should
be made eligible for the invalid pension.

They Never Had a Chance.
The report of M. P. Dunlop, M.L.C.,
president of the N.S.W. Primary Pro-
ducers’ Union, on the South Westralian
group settlements reveals almost unbe-
lievable conditions. Dunlop is himself
a dairy-farmer—his place is on the big
scrub lands of Kyogle—so he should
know what he is talking about. He
visited the Peel Estate, between the
Darling Ranges and the coast.
A more desolate and forbidding stretch
of country cannot be imagined. No
wonder farms are being abandoned; why
they were ever established is a mystery.
Sour, waterlogged country with huge agri-
cultural drains is interspersed with higher
land of raw white sand.
On the Margaret, further south, he
found the position of settlers to range
from “precarious” to “hopeless.” It is
jarrah and red-gum country; the only
pasture is “subterranean clover, growing
profusely with the aid of a bag of super,
per acre per year.” There are no native
grasses suitable for cowfeed, “unless
zamia palm and grass-tree may be in-
cluded in that category.” Farms vary in
size from 100 to 160 acres, usually more
than 50 p.c. virgin bush'and carrying an
average herd of 15 head. Yet capital
cost per farm has been from £lBOO to
£2000! Sometimes they have been
cleared with the aid of gelignite at a cost
up to £3O an acre, but after 10 years’
occupation most of them “look like a
North Coast (N.S.W.) selection after the
first year’s pioneering.” “Beyond re-
demption,” “utterly depressing” and “the
end of all things” are other remarks
which occurred to the man from N. S.
Wales during his wanderings.
The Commonwealth cannot be blamed
for the fiasco, nor is it the fault of the
settlers —roughly, half Britons and half
Australians. Says Mr. Dunlop, “In the
men and women who had the courage
and endurance to take up these farms
the State has a great asset,” and the
majority “would make ends meet on the
roughest North Coast country” of N. S.
Wales. The same cannot be said of
politicians responsible for their plight
and for the squandering of so many mil-
lions. If justice were done the politicians
would be condemned to put in at least
two years on “sour, waterlogged” hold-
ings, “interspersed with raw white sand.”

The Two Labor Parties.
Arthur Griffith blames the news-
papers: —
The smashing defeat of the A.L.P. candi-
dates in N.S.W. by the Langsters is largely the
result of dishonest propaganda by Sydney
daily papers. The “Daily Telegraph,” the “Labor
Daily” and the “Sun” throughout the campaign
were persistent in propagating the untruth that
the Lang section is the N.S.W. branch of the
A.L.P. The “Telegraph” went so far as to
state that Lang was the leader of the Australian
Labor party in N.S.W., and, more than that,
the “campaign director in N.S.W. of the
Australian Labor Party," well knowing that
this position was held by Mr. Chifley. In one
issue the “Telegraph” referred to the Lang
party as the Australian Labor party and the
A.L.P. as the “Scullin faction.”
This propaganda was undertaken obviously
for the purpose of securing for Langster can-
didates those seats which were bound to go to
Labor, with the object of preventing Mr. Scul-
lin having behind him in the new Parliament
a solid following of A.L.P. supporters.
It was the big unattached democratic element,
which generally votes Labor, that was influenced
by these misstatements to believe that it was
really voting for the A.L.P. when giving
its votes for members of an organisation
which had been formally expelled by the
governing body of the movement, i.e., the inter-
state executive of the Australian Labor party.
The “Herald” described the Lang party by
its proper title — i.e., “the State Labor party ’ —
but the course it adopted — i.e., representing
that Lang and Scullin were working in co-
operation—was equally hurtful to the A.L.P.
candidates.
All this may have been good tactics, but
no one will pretend that it is honest jour-
nalism, and the repercussion after the next
State election will probably mean a Lang
Government, which will be about as helpful to
N.S.W. as would a seven years’ drought.
. 4
Penalising Thrift.
During the Commonwealth election cam-
paign every U.A.P. speaker implored the
small investor to “protect his savings in
insurance policies and building socie-
ties.” Now that the shouting has died
down, U.A.P. Governments might con-
sider exactly what they themselves do to
encourage thrift on the part of the small
investor and to protect him.
Taxes paid by the Victorian Perma-
nent Building Society last year amounted
to 4s. Id. in the £ of net' income. In
1930, the society paid £BO5 on £12,284 ;
in 1933 it paid £lBO5 on a little over
half that amount. Says the chairman: —•
The extraordinary position exists that
the society must pay taxes on a propor-
tion of its interest earnings from Com-
monwealth bonds (which are supposed to
be tax-free), on the ground that manage-
' merit expenses include expenditure in col-
lecting interest from bonds!
It pays land tax, too, on properties in
its possession. In the hands of borrowers,
the properties are exempt because of
their low individual value, but when they
are left on the hands of the society the
value of them is lumped together, and
a few more figures are written into the
tax return. It is sharp practice, but it
is claimed to be the law.
• ♦;
Three Thousand Miles Away.
A full Bench of the Commonwealth
Arbitration Court has met in Melbourne
to fix the basic wage for the Northern
Territory. Melbourne is 3000 miles-odd
from Darwin —as far as Bagdad is from
London —but Drake-Brockman, J., has
just made the arduous trip to investi-
gate on the spot. The North Australian
workers sent a man from Darwin to
argue, and half a dozen societies are
represented.
There are 1450 N.T. wage- and salary-
earners, of whom 302 are in the civil
service or professions, 170 in finance
and commerce and a couple of hundred
in personal and domestic service. About
33 p.c. of the population is Asiatic, Poly-
nesian or half-caste.
The representative of the Common-
wealth Railways pointed out to the Court
that the present wage varied from
2s. 2Jd. per hour (there is a nice ring
of exactitude about the figure) to
£3 16s. 3d. per week, plus £1 per week in
certain districts. The hourly rate was
derived from an award of Beeby, J.,
made in 1927 —2s. 6d. per hour less 18
p.c. emergency reduction, exclusive of
district ’allowance.
Employers now want the wage to be
fixed at 2s. per hour, less 10 p.c. The
unions ask 3s. 14d. per hour.
The latter point to the arduousness of
conditions. One which they will not
mention concerns the Darwin wharf —a
nice pier with an elbow in the middle.
Ten years ago, a Commonwealth Public
Works Committee, whose six members
travelled 8000 miles at public expense
for the purpose, wrote a report on the
wharf which ran to 330,000 words and
cost 2} p.c. of the value of the year’s
overseas exports from the Territory to
print. But nothing has happened to the
wharf, although its angle is so sharp that
no railway truck can get round it ex-
cept on a turntable. The Waterside
Workers have always made a national
issue of any attempt to remove the angle,
because it makes more work as it is!
If the matter lay between private em-
ployers and employees the wharf would
be reorganised, along with a lot of other
Darwin facilities, and 2s. 2id. an hour
might be paid so much more frequently
that the face of the census income table
might be altered beneficially.
At present, despite the Arbitration
Court, two-fifths of the population (in-
cluding, of course, children) have no
income, and of the remaining 2700 about
870 earn less than £1 per week and 1700
less than £3 per week. Only 650 collect
more than £2OB per annum, and there
are 210 persons who have been com-
pletely unemployed for from one year
to “five years and over.”
Meanwhile, the Big Cities swarm with
industrial advocates, and the Full Court
goes on sweltering in its wigs and argu-
ing about farthings.
“A Lot of Junk.”
Fern Tree Gully (Vic.) has decided to
give the Duke of Gloucester, an inkstand
“embellished with the council’s crest.”
It is to cost £2O. If H.R.H. has ever
heard of Fern Tree Gully he may sigh to
think that his trophy is to be of native
wood, a material lacking the quality of
the aldermanic ivory behind which this
sort of wasteful toadyism is conceived.
In the good old days, when tyrants
were tyrants, they usually did the giving.
The Praetorian Guard once sold the
Roman Emperorship to the bestower of
the highest donative, and
As Lord Marmion crossed the court
He scattered angels round.
Democracy likes to do its own patronis-
ing.
One of the councillors, a Cornishman
named Treganowan, protested:
Where is the money coming from? I
expect the Duke will look on these presen-
tations as I do —as a lot of junk.
A greater mind countered that his High-
ness “might make a hobby of these
things. He is sure to have a museum fdr
his collection.”
Assuredly he has. There are lots of
attics, cellars and disused stables around
royal dwellings, and, if they were not
used to hide the hideousness which ser-
vile leagues and councils foist on un-
willing princes, no palace would be lit
to live in. As a general rule, royalty
sees an aldermanic gift once.
Twenty pounds would provide live
unemployed men with a week’s work. If
the Duke is anything like the heir-
apparent he would rather see them get
it than carry home an unwanted inkstand
“embellished with the council’s crest.”
“Not Attributable to Service.”
The decision that the neuroses which
manifested themselves in the late Lieut.-
Commander Casey after he had done the
Special Advanced Course in signalling at
Greenwich (England) were “not attribut-
able to service” raises an important ques-
tion from the standpoint of R.A.N. ranks
and ratings.
Before entering the R.A.N. College
Casey’s father (in common with the
parents or guardians of all the other
boys) had to make a declaration. He said
that his son’s general health was good ;
that he had never received any injuries
to his head ; that he had never suffered
from fits, and that neither he nor any
member of the family had “any pecu-
liarity in health or constitution.” The
ages of the candidate’s father, mother
and grandparents, living and at death,
were inquired into. After a severe medi-
cal examination he was accepted subject
to a proviso: “If it is found that in
any important respect [particularly with
regard to question 10, i.e., “Has he any
peculiarity in health or constitution?”]
the statements made on his behalf are in-
accurate he will be discharged.”
None of the statements was found to
be inaccurate. From the date of his
arrival at Jervis Bay until he was “in-
valided” by the Naval Board against the
advice of a Macquafie-street psychiatrist
and two Medical Boards, Lieut.-Com-
mander Casey had nothing worth calling
an illness till his breakdown in England.
Yet his breakdown, say the authorities,
“was not attributable to service” ; it was
“constitutional.”
A similar position arose after the
Armistice ; in fact, it began to operate
at Horseferry-road, and in many A.I.F.
hospitals and depots before the Armis-
tice, when it was known at the War
Office that the Germans were cracking.
Diggers were invited to sign declarations
that any minor disabilities which they
happened to have —deafness, short-sight-
edness, the after-effects of trench feet,
chest troubles, blood pressure and the
like —were “not attributable to service.”
No more volunteers were wanted ; it was
the business of officials to save the
Government pension-money. Thousands
signed, and didn’t give pensions another
thought. Yet few who took the war in
the right spirit, even at bases, came
through as fit, physically and mentally,
as they might have if they had stayed
at home. Figures which have been
checked by the R.S.L. officials bear out
a claim made before a war-pensions tri-
bunal last week that “war service has
reduced the normal expectancy of life
by 10 years.”
Sea service, even in peace-time, bears
resemblances to war service. The ambi-
tious have to pay the penalty. Just as
Diggers who volunteered for raiding
parties sometimes ended up on stretchers,
so R.A.N. officers who elect to work at
top mental pressure sometimes break
down.
The Bulletin submits that, when a
previously healthy officer or rating goes
under to any complaint that might have
been acquired as a result of his service,
the Navy Board should assume that his
service was responsible.

“S.T.S.”: Adelaide Public Library has
discovered that it is just 100 years old —
on paper. The State itself existed that
way, before its actual foundation, and
enthusiasts in London even formed a
S.A. Literary and Scientific Association
in 1834, two years
ahead of Adelaide’s
existence. The library
grew out of that into
its present handsome
building just 50 years
ago ; and it proposes to
celebrate the double
event by exhibiting
some of the original
volumes which London
sent as a nucleus for
the projected gentle-
man-farmers’ Utopia.
“Sealed Pattern”: The Bulletin,
usually so accurate in such matters, made
a slip when it referred to the huge head-
dress of the Foot-Guards in one of last
week’s cartoons as a “busby.” Busbies
are worn by. fusilier regiments. Hussars
and the R.A., the material being racoon
fur. The rifle regiments have another
busby, a differently-shaped article of astra-
khan, and the ludicrous inverted pudding-
bowl of the R.A.F. is yet a third. The
Household Brigade lid is the “bearskin.”
The only other wearers of a bearskin in
the service are the 2nd Dragoons—the
Scots Greys. There is another error in
a drawing depicting two attractive maids
fighting for a bandsman for the right to
"Don’t that speedboat look silly gettot along half out of the water?”
“walk out” with him. The caption adds
that the missus will find it'a job to keep

thinks she can "walk out with a guards-
man for nothing, she can guess again.

larbor Plain ; but there is a lot of differ-
ence about the distance, variously esti-
mated as from 300 to 330 miles. As the
surveyor who measured the line from
Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie in 1920, tak-
ing eight months over the job, may I set
the question at rest. The straight is not
even 300 miles. It is 297 miles 1290.3
links.

anywhere else on the French railway
lines. You hire your van for 4s. 6d. a
day, plus half the first-class fare for the
distance travelled. You can pick the
station at which you want to be shunted,
and when another hook-up is required
a word to the stationmaster will ensure
it. The vans have been repainted and re-
conditioned, and, it is claimed, the old
and musty smell has been entirely eli-
minated. If so, it is another tribute to
the miracles of modern sanitary science.

“Cui Bono”: Sopwith may carry the
America’s Cup back to England, but he

obtained by regularly failing to do so.
Hundreds of thousands the millionaire,
bacon-vendor spent on his Shamrocks,
but it came back, many times over, in
increased demand for his wares on both
sides of the Atlantic, largely due to the
generous sympathy evoked by his appar-
ent doggedness and gameness. His “try,
try again” attitude brought him again
and again into the front page as a sports-
man and even procured him an inti-
macy with royalty which his hams and
teas, however succulent and fragrant,
could never have done. Not that Lipton
wasn’t a good sportsman enough, accord-
ing to his lights, but his was essentially
the kind of sportsmanship that returns
excellent dividends.

South America and Australia are lumped

scribed as “Terra Incognita Australis.’’
One of the weird fauna has points in
common with the kangaroo, which sug-
gests that long before Dampier s time
some roving navigator touched on these
shores and brought back a hazy descrip-
tion of the animal. The artist, however,
has given the creature a long neck, a
small head and a pouch in which are
two of its young.

“R. Volt”: After 70 years’ service the
Morse code is to disappear from the
British post office. Its place will be taken
by the teleprinter, operated by girls who
don’t know a dot from a dash and don’t
need to. There were two versions of
Morse when I learnt the business
30 years ago, and the struggle for
supremacy had just been won by
the present method. The 8.P.0. re-
ports that the teleprinter can handle
hundreds of messages hourly, compared
with an average of 36 by the Morse sys-
tem, so it looks as if a lot of old reliables
will be joining the dole ranks. Some of
them were virtuosi of the key. I knew
one Australian operator who could keep
up 180 letters a minute for hours on end.
and you could scarcely tell it from auto-
matic sending. But the spectre of a
breakdown was always round the corner.
I knew one brilliant sender who got a
neurosis about the letter “y.” Whenever
he saw it coming along his fingers began
to stutter. He had to be taken off and
put on a cable circuit which uses the
same code but two levers. He soon
became as good as ever, and then the
letter “h” became his bugbear. Finally,
he had to be put on checking.
“S.T.S.”: Douglas Mawson, of Antarc-
tic fame, now Prof, of Geology at Adel-
aide, gives warm approval to the gold-
mines now being reopened in the hills
behind the city. He does not expect new
finds, as the whole district was well
combed by prospectors long ago. But
the Bird-in-Hand and other old shows
have an infinitely better chance now than
when they were abandoned. Methods,
machinery, keeping water out, saving
gold from tailings and especially gold
prices—all are far more favorable now
than half a century back when the mines
were actually paying regular dividends.
For the baser metals, Mawson says, all
of this is true also, except as to price,
which will have to be waited for.

“Jeames” is critical:
Curious that journalists who accompany tour-
ing royalties should have to be more abject
than those who write about the same royalties
in the U.K. Compare the chatty, informative
references to Prince George of late with the
reverential reticence of “Our Special Represen-
tative Aboard H.M.S. Sussex.” Cable-students
can make a better job of reconstructing a
recognisable human being from one item about
Prince George buying the ring or getting into
kilts to meet Princess Marina in Scotland than
from yards of stuff headed “At Sea,” and
dealing with weather, deck sports or dinners
at which “the Duke entered thoroughly into
the spirit of the evening.” If the Duke had
condemned a dinner as foul and an evening
as deadly, it might have been interesting. The
messages, as sent, are simply not worth send-
ing. The traveller is presented as a kind ql
Dalai Lama in whose presence the journalist
retains an adulatory position on the flat of
the stomach, occasionally emitting timid gurgles
of loyal pleasure at the sacred being’s con-
descension. Of course it isn't the journalist s
fault; the policy was decided on by the pub-
licity experts at Buckingham Palace. But what s
the point of it?
LAUDAMUS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
So you’re back again, safe in the saddle,
My artlessly amiable Joe,
And the hopes of Jim Scullin skedaddle
And the brownie of Beasley is dough.
The battle’s decided, you’ve won it
And can bid your opponents go hang;
But I doubt if you’d ever have done it,
Old man, without Lang.
Now the tumult and shouting is over
Except for the usual whoop
Of the jubilant victors —in clover —
And the howl of their foes —in the soup;
Now you’re raising the glad Jubilate
, With fully excusable vim,
Bethink, you’ve a debt that is weighty
Still owing to him.
What though he adopted the courses
To which Plaza Toro inclined,
Arraying a tergo his forces
And leading his mob from behind,
Grim memories he well could be trusted
To raise, whensoever he spoke,
Of the various parties he busted,
The bank that he broke.
What spectres around him would gather,
As oft as he made his assault,
Of past braggadocio and blather,
Of debt and distress and default,
Of a bull among china a-tramplc,
Of a State to insolvency near —
And, last, of an Awful Example
Flung out on his ear!
Aye, Joe, you were pelted with daisies
By sturdy supporters in packs
Who boosted your prowess like blazes
And clung to your shadow like wax.
You were rich in your friendships—there’s tacit
Agreement on that, I suppose—
But I’d rank him a heftier asset,
The Boss of your foes.
You were always safe backing at evens,
And 1 haven’t a doubt that you are
Intensely indebted to Stevens,
To Parkie and Perkins and Marr.
Thank Heaven for these and for other
Offsiders your praises who sang . . .
And even more fervently, brother,
Thank Heaven for Lang!

“Shiggs”: The other day a country
parson had to deny a rumor that he had
refused to bury a person of another
denomination. The defunct was a Presby-
terian ; all the C. of E. man had done was
to suggest that an endeavor be made to
bring a Presbyterian minister to read the
funeral service, failing which he would
officiate. It reminds me of the earlier
times in Queensland’s backblocks. A
young curate was sent to a mining centre
where he was the only cleric. A strenu-
ous Nonconformist had died, and the
curate wasn’t quite sure how the Angli-
can service would fit; so he wired the
Bishop of Brisbane: “Prominent Baptist
dead here. Can I bury him?” Back
came the answer: “Bury all Baptists
possible.”

“Runa”: Doyle (B. 19/9/’34) not only
went astray in the geographical points
of his M.L. efforts, but made further
statements which added to the gaiety of
the Dominion. His gold-seekers trekked
lightheartedly from Nelson to Bendigo,
“Woodman, spare that tree!”
“'Ave a ’eart, cobber. Go an’ cut one for yerself!”
apparently having mastered the art of
walking on the ocean ; cowboys in their
enormous hats patrolled the M.L. coast,
and the sea was alive with venomous
snakes. Doyle, who apparently had
never seen a map of the localities he
wrote about, said in after years that he
agreed to the republication of these gems
of inaccuracy “with considerable reluct-
ance.”
* * * *
“Tasman”: “Oh, these amateurs!” an
old Sydney actor said to me when a
cast from the Teachers’ College Drama-
tic Society had performed the one-act
play “The Road of the Poplars” at the
social of the Fellow-
ship of Writers. “They
never trouble about
details. That soldier
who came on as a
ghost of a man killed
in the war was wearing
the uniform of the Syd-
ney University regi-
ment.”
“Venator”: I grow
tired of seeing racing
described as “the sport
of kings”—a cherished
illusion of turf writers
—when it is nothing of
the sort. It is, of
course, to hunting that
the phrase was origin-
ally applied, and it per-
sisted down to the time
of the illustrious Jor-
rocks: “Hunting, the
sport of kings, the
image of war without
its guilt and only five-
and-twenty per cent, of
its danger!” If Jor-
rocks had lived to see
the Great War, he
might have knocked a
good bit off that per-
centage. Anyway, no
English kings ever had
the chance to go racing
before the Stuarts,
while hunting was the
favorite pastime of
many, from William
the Conqueror to William of Orange —
though whether either of those monarchs
would have reckoned the pursuit of the
fox worth while is another question.

“Hampstead”: “As from January 1
next,” says a cable, “compulsory driv-
ing tests for motorists will be imposed
in Britain.” When I got a license in
London a few years ago it cost 55., and
I didn’t even have to apply for it in
person. Yet the proportion of fatal
accidents in England was about the same
then as now, and also the same as it is
now on the Continent and in this coun-
try and in the U.S.A.—roughly 150 per
million of the population per year. The
chief damage to life and limb is not done
in any country by incompetent, old or
physically afflicted drivers (all of whom
are ipso facto cautious), but by the flash
and (to a considerably less extent) the
alcoholic. The potential killers in every
community number between 10 and 15
p.c. of the drivers. Any country which
disqualified for ever those convicted of
driving while “under the influence” and
those who have had as many as six
“For you, my dear Miss Lamb, I see a journey across deep water, and, rather
vaguely, something connected with mint sauce.”
serious accidents would reduce its motor-
ing death-rate to negligible proportions,
and there is no other means by which
it can be reduced.
Tribute from a Cockney:
Every true Londoner will feel a pang of
grief at the news that “the old Surrey” is in
the hands of housebreakers. The bulk of its
audiences came from the south side of the
river—Bermondsey, Walworth, Camberwell —
but it was frequented in its prime by thousands
who normally favored West End theatres. I
knew it first in the late ’nineties. It specialised
then during most of the year in blood-and-
thunder melodrama of a far fruitier kind than
was being presented at the Adelphi by poor
Bill Terriss, and at Christmastime it put on a,
panto. It was experiencing a queer revival when
I revisited it a few years ago. An astute man-
ager had conceived the idea of staging such
half-forgotten essays in pure gore as “Sweeney
Todd,” and supercilious intellectuals were
flocking to it over Waterloo Bridge from as
far afield as Chelsea and North Hampstead.
The Surrey was built before Cook discovered
Botany Bay, and, though it crouched unobtru-
sively in what is now little better than a slum,
it had a queer charm of its own. Charlie
Chaplin was born near by; Dan Leno, Herbert
Campbell and Harry Randall appeared on its
stage; and fat George Conquest, a lessee for
many years, told me that Ed. VII, when Prince
of Wales, had often occupied the stage-box at
pantomimes.

“Whitehall”: Can anybody tell me
who gets either profit or pleasure from
the thumb-nail illustrations which our
tabloids use with their cables? The
“Labor Daily's” caracoling cuirassier
who accompanies the paper’s Parisian
items is anyhow apposite to the extent that
one sometimes sees cuirassiers in Paris.
But the “Sun’s” snap of Cologne’s great
R.C. cathedral rarely illustrates anything.
It went in last Thursday to elucidate a
Berlin cable about a political speech
made in Hanover (on the other side of
Germany from Cologne) by Dr. Muller,
the Lutheran bishop-Nazi who denies
that the Saviour was a Jew. A Victorian
sheet recently published a picture of St.
James’s Palace to sheet home the news
that the Court was going to Balmoral!
* * * :p'
“Boulevardier”: I note that “Pine-
needle” (B. 12/9/’34) was informed by
his Egyptian guide that the undressed
dance by women only which he saw in
Cairo was the true Parisian cancan. It
would have been just as inaccurate to
describe it as a hula-lwla. The cold
truth is—as “Vieux Marcheur” (B.
19/9/’34) might have pointed out —that
the cancan was founded on the old-
fashioned quadrille, a set dance which
no one knows anything about nowadays.
Men and women in evening dress took
part, all being professionals. The whole
soul of the thing was the frenzied orgy
of high-kicking which wound up the
show. It really was the cancan which
introduced to the stage outside Paris the
skirted high-kicking craze by women
dancers, which even found expression in
the cachuca in Gilbert and Sullivan’s
“Gondoliers.” The most vivid descrip-
tion of the dance I have ever read was
written by Mark Twain in “The Inno-
cents Abroad.” He saw it in the vol-
canic last days of the Second Empire,
* * *
“Sububs”: Last week a couple of
birds who might have been retired or
disqualified car-minders called at my
home and offered to protect it for “ss.
a week paid in advance.” Undesirables,
I was told, were abroad in increas-
ing numbers; burglars, milk-pinchers
garden-destroyers. Is it a racket in em-
bryo? The Chicago gangster industry
began on similarly modest lines during
the consulship of Big Bill Thompson,
and in a short time citizens were paying
weekly in advance to be allowed to re-
main alive.

“D.8.K.”: The pilotless ’plane inci-
dent at Newcastle (N.S.W.), where Miss
Southern Cross tore herself away from
the prop swinger, was no new thing.
Writer recalls a similar incident at Lem-
nos in 1918. Pilots had strict instruc-
tions that if landing out on the ’drome
with a “lost prop” they must await the
arrival of a mechanic to do the necessary
swinging. However, Lieut. Maclntyre,
in a Sopwith Camel, landing thus,
scorned assistance, and, setting his throttle
just open, clambered out and swung.
Unfortunately his clothing had caught
the throttle lever as he left the cockpit,
and with a roar the Camel leapt ahead,
leaving the pilot dazed. Executing a
beautiful take-off, she headed for the
blue until a fickle air current swung her
controls. Swerving, she dashed over the
’drome at no more than three feet above
ground, and with a sickening sound of
rending and splintering dashed clean
through the open curtains of a Bes-
soneau hangar. The remains of the
two DH9 acks that had been reposing
peacefully therein and of the intruding
Camel sent the C.O. into a swoon, and
the subsequent strafing ensured that
pilots didn’t swing their own props there-
after. The Camel missed the writer, pass-
ing the hangar door by a matter of
inches.
* ❖ ❖
Sartorial note:
It is grim news that a London tailoring
organisation “decided last week to establish a
men’s fashion bureau; men,” according to the
secretary, “have no gift for clothes, no instinct
for color schemes and no taste in ensemble.”
Color ensembles, while applauded by the young
men of the shirt department at Austin Reed’s,
would be unequivocally damned by the young
men of the Guards’ Club. The public school
Briton leaves harmonious color schemes to
’Arries and Continental gigolos. The Bulletin
film critic recently criticised Jack Buchanan for
wearing a blazer on the Riviera. Australians
won’t see the Duke wearing a blazer away from
a cricket field; no old Etonian has ever done
such a thing. Yet to thousands of Englishmen
blazers are ideal for holiday wear. Pick up
almost any summer issue of “Punch” and you
will see drawings of lads at Margate, Clacton,
etc , clad as pyrotechnically as Jack Buchanan
is in. his latest film. I have seen Australians
wearing blazers in theatres! It s all a question
of taste. The obvious objective of the “fashion
bureau” is to get more color into men’s clothes.
I hope it fails, but I fear it won’t. The
spade-work has already been done by Holly-
wood, as witness the blinding appearance ol
the average golfer.
TAILS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
• “Dress coats, with longer tails than ever, designed
to give men a more athletic appearance, wifi replace
the dinner jacket as correct evening wear, particu-
larly during the Prince’s visit.”
Those skimpy affairs that snips designate “sac,”
It’s hinted, aside must be thrown;
’Twill soon be apparent the “swallowtail’s”
back,
The “claw-hammer’s” back to its own.
For the fashions that women obediently heed
Are equally binding for males,
And the “Tailor and Cutter,” ’twould seem, has
decreed
Men look more athletic in tails.
That’s that!
A heap more imposing in tails.
The notion, I think, not improbably dates
From the days when our ancestors swung
From treetops, and, gleefully pelting their
mates
With nuts, remained lissome and young.
They kept fit as fiddles, it’s safe to assert,
They needed no covers or veils,
And, being unacquainted with pants or with
shirt,
They banked for attraction on tails.
They found
A certain distinction in tails.
And now we return, for shivoos; to the coat
Our grand-dads impressively wore,
Except that the caudal appendage, you’ll note,
Will be longer than ever before.
Hey! brother, whose waist has gone woefully
west
From a diet of sirloins and ales,
Rejoice! Once again you can fling out your
chest,
You'll look far more athletic in tails
(Like me),
A lot less lopsided in tails.

POLITICAL POINTS
It should not take a fortnight to count
all the votes for the House of Reps.,
but apparently it will. The U.A.P. has
•gained Corangamite (Vic.) from the
Cockies, but has lost Batman (Vic.),
Maribyrnong (Vic.), Lang (N.S.W.) and
Bass (Tas.), where Minister Guy finished
166 votes behind Scullin-Labor man
Barnard. If, as seems likely, it loses
Franklin (Tas.), Denison (Tas.) and Mac-
quarie (N.S.W.) as well, its 38 seats in
the last House will be reduced to 32
31 if Cameron (Barker) sits with the
Country party. And there are haunting
doubts about Adelaide.
Leaving out Archie Cameron, the
Country party is sure of 14 seats. Scul-
lin-Labor must have 18 and may have
20; Lang-Labor must have eight and may
have 10. If Lang-Labor can oust Lawson
in Macquarie and Blakeley in Darling
it may be in a position to force a union
of the factions with Beasley as leader,
for certain of the Victorians and Tas-
manians are very tepid supporters of
Scullin; and Bardolph (Adelaide) was,
of course, a Langster before the four
S.A. Labor “parties” united.
If “Lyons goes on alone,” as his former
private secretary says he will, his Gov-
ernment may be defeated at any time.
The U.A.P. will be crazy if it lets an
accidental leader (Labor-socialist, 1909-
1931) who has made so poor a show-
ing in his own State place it in such a
position.
The night before the poll Lyons con-
fided to the Women’s National League
“Good old Joe! The U.A.P. every
time! We’re behind it!”
at Launceston that his new party was
sure to carry Tasmania, for these
reasons: —?
In places where formerly U.A.P. can-
didates could not get a hearing they have
been well received this time. I have been
cheered on the road by Tasmanians where-
ever I have met them.
Even Joseph may now suspect that the
persons who applauded him—grinning
relief workers, no doubt —must have
voted the other way. However reduced,
Australians will have their joke.
For the Senate, U.A.P.-C.P. candidates
are sure to win in N. S. Wales, Victoria
and Westralia and the L.C.L. (Liberal
and Country League) trio in South Aus.
There is not much between the party
totals in Queensland and Tasmania, and
both sides may gain representation in
both States. The obligation to “put a
number in every square” has cost all
hands a lot of votes in four States. In
N. S. Wales alone there will be about
200,000 spoilt ballot papers, and the pre-
diction here ventured that the total might
reach half a million will not be far out.
At Launceston the night before the
election, Lyons “recalled that he had led
the anti-conscription forces during the
Great War.” Ninety-nine per cent, of
U.A.P. supporters who had votes then
were conscriptionists. It’s a good thing
for Joseph they’re easy-going.
Lamaro, Lang’s last Attorney-General,
lives a political life like “Out again,
in again, gone again Finnegan.” He
“What we need in Australia, “l didn’t say De flation!”
and what my party will
give you, is Re flation.”
first came under notice in 1925, when
Hughes licked him for North Sydney.
Solaced with what looked like a safe
State seat in Petersham, he was heaved
out in 1932. Lang paved the way into
Leichhardt for him, and later persuaded
him to contest Federal Watson, getting
him the nomination when two deter-
mined persons named Flanagan and
Martin were after it. Now Watson has
rejected him, and someone else has got
the Leichhardt nomination. Defeat has
two consolations for Joseph—he is used
to it and he did have the courage to
stand, which is more than can be said
for his leader.
Forgan Smith greatly admires his Gov-
ernment’s “extension of relief benefits”
and its “attempts to open up wider
avenues of employment.”. He thinks that
the country should be equally enthusias-
tic, or at least that it should be recon-
ciled to a continuance of the relief tax
and to an estimated deficit of £1,250,000.
The unemployment rate is now down to
15 p.c., but is still 1.4 p.c. higher than
in 1930; in effect, 26,730 are out of
work. And the population capable of
working is growing at the rate of over
200 per month.
Reported that a Japanese sampan
called at Possession Island and carried
off a prospector’s stack of ore, and that
there is another nosing about the neigh-
borhood. One of these days Pearce will
wake to find his Darwin oilfanks or the
Customshouse at T.I. missing.
If returned next May, Queensland
Labor will add a Cabinet Minister to the
10 who already draw salaries. He will
take over Health and Local Government
from the Home Secretary. More than
one member in every six will then be a
Minister.
It is now plain that if Pearce and the
other bosses of the Nats.’ organisation had
stood out against the secessionists they
could have re-elected Senator Kingsmill.
They sacrificed him to their craven fears,
only to learn that the separatists could
not have done them a ha’porth of harm.
The veteran has been very shabbily
treated.
N.S.W. financial returns due on Sept.
1 were not announced till the 19th—four
days after the Commonwealth election.
The figures for two months show a “re-
gression” (the new fancy name for it)
of £192,300 compared with the corre-
sponding period of 1933-34, expenditure
having exceeded revenue by £2,292,100.
Also with the Commonwealth election
in mind, the Government decided to dis-
tribute another £400,000 p.a. among its
civil servants. Hence much of the “re-
gression.”
It is a good thing for Hunter, of Mara-
noa, that he doesn’t suffer from nerves ;
if he did he would have cracked up long
ago. He succeeded the late Jim Page in
1921. On that occasion and at the gen-
eral elections of ’22, ’25, ’2B, ’29, ’3l and
’34 he was thousands behind at the end
of the first day’s counting. Always the
newspapers have announced his defeat,
only to explain to-
wards the end of
the next week that
outback returns
had put Hunter
thousands ahead.
Hunter is an ac-
countant by pro-
fession, and just as
worthy of Cabinet
rank as the ac-
countants in the
N.S.W. Ministry;
but he has never
had their luck.
The two out-
standing personal
victories of the
election were those
of C. A. S. Hawker
in Wakefield (S.A.)
and J. B. Fairbairn
in Flinders (Vic.).
Each had a majority of 14,000-odd:
Hawker over a Douglasite and a Labor-
ite; Fairbairn over a Laborite, a Cocky
and a Communist. They are both re-
turned soldiers, members of old pastoral
families, and men of high character.
Nelson, the voteless member for the
N.T. since 1922, isn’t having it all his
own way this time. Last election he
came home 22 votes to the good in a
total of 1465. Now, with 1635 votes
counted, including Darwin’s industrial
quota, which is usually in his favor, he
is 60 behind an Independent, A. M.
Brain. Only 300 postal votes from
Batchelor and Alice Springs are to come,
and they seem unlikely to save him.
One of the Westralian gentlemen who
are taking the secesh petition to London
mentions that the delegation is going
to “place it at the foot of the throne.” It
is to be hoped that the King will keep
“We’re here to deposit it at the foot of
the throne, your Majesty."
“Well, don’t you drop it on MY foot. I
was in the navy, remember.”
his feet well tucked in. The document
is one of the weightiest in Australian his-
tory. If it fell on the kingly toe it would
certainly produce an appropriate but in-
voluntary answer to secesh’s prayer.
Latham is anxious to return to his law
business, so it is expected that Menzies
will become Attorney-General right
“Brawny fellow, this Menzies, isn’t he,
Prime Minister? But don’t be
frightened it’s intellect that
counts."
away. Physically as well as mentally, he
will be the biggest man in the Ministry.
But not the man with the biggest head.
“S. M. Herald” added Douglas Credit
votes to those of the U.A.P. and U.C.P.
to swell the anti-socialist majority. In
Lang, of 7044 Barclay-Smith preferences
—Barclay-Smith is a Douglasite leader—
-5317 went to Mulcahy, the State Labor
man, and only 1727 to Robinson (U.A.P.).
Is party government doomed? Apart
from the European countries that have
abandoned it, Britain and the S’African
Union have national Governments, and
Southern Rhodesia is following their ex-
ample. After a decade of partyism, dur-
ing which the Government of the day
has held nearly all the seats, the Labor
members have been invited to join a
united party. If they agree there will
be no Opposition. The disintegration of
Labor since Lang started to perform sug-
gests that Australia in time may take the
same road.
Vic. Leg. Assembly chuckled when
Lemmon (Lab.) called the attention of
the Speaker to the fact that he had been
obliged to wipe his fingers on a Japanese
geisha. The damsel had got into the
building by the back door, so to speak,
her effigy figuring on some paper ser-
viettes in the refreshment-room. A de-
bate ensued as to employing Australian-
made wipers. It turned out that the
napkins were made in England, and the
discussion lapsed.
With export markets unsettled, the first
half of 1935 will pot be a happy time
for Treasurers. London loans convert-
ible between now and October, 1935,
total over £80,000,000; State loans
definitely maturing in 1935 total
£102,000,000, of which £71,000,000 was
borrowed in Australia. As N. S. Wales
is saddled with £50,229,000 of this
amount, the Commonwealth Treasurer
had better ask his brother Stevens to get
his election over before he tackles it.
“D.E.”: Smedley (Wakefield) was not
the only candidate who acted as his own
press-agent (B. 19/9/’34). “Dryblower”
Murphy, who stood for the Senate in
W.A.—as a secessionist with strong
national sentiments —did likewise, and
dropped into poetry. Lines from his
final ode to the electors:
Turn down all the urgers and ferrets
Who canvass, who plead and cajole;
Judge a candidate solely on merits
When You Go to the Poll.
The poet may lose his deposit.

have nurtured and diploma’d him, and
he has taught and lectured at still more,
the list including Belfast, Glasgow, Edin-
burgh, Berlin, Marburg, Princeton,
Berkeley (California) and Columbia
(New York). Dr. Angus spent many
years in America before being appointed
to the chair of New Testament and His-
torical Theology in St. Andrew’s, Syd-
ney. He is a classical scholar of excep-
tional distinction who has delved deep
into other creeds beside his own ; one
of his books deals with the “Religious
Quests of the Graeco-Roman World.”

Dr. Ward, the new Professor of Bac-
teriology at Sydney Uni., had just fin-
ished his course as a Rhodes scholar
when the war began. He enlisted at
once and saw most of his service with
the K.R.R. After the Armistice he got
a Rockefeller Fellowship, and he has
spent most of the intervening years in
the U.S.A., his latest job being assistant-
professor of bacteriology at Harvard.
The death in a motor smash of Jack
Judd, of Hobart “Mercury,” has left a
gap in the ranks of Digger pressmen.
Judd saw service with the 15th Battalion
in his early twenties. Wedding an Eng-
lish lass after the war, he returned to
his native Tas. and to what may be
called his native profession (his dad
was Harry Judd, the Speck’s best min-
ing journalist in the boom days of
Zeehan and Mt. Lyell) on the “World”
staff and later as senior on the “Mer-
cury.” He was 41, and leaves three small
sons.
Newspapermen anxious to find out
from Kingsford .Smith whether or not
his Lady Southern Cross ’plane has been
certified as airworthy rate it their hard-
est job to discover where he happens to
be at any given moment. After his
record flight from Melbourne to Perth,
he came back to Sydney, dropping in at
DAN GREEN, student and man about
town. He studies, among other
things, politics, rats and mice.
Adelaide on the way—2l7s miles in 9
hours 32 minutes of actual flying. Last
week he hopped up to Brisbane, 475
miles, and lopped 42 minutes off the
record, leaving it at 2 hours 35 minutes —
for a brief space ; returning, he cut it
to 2 hours 17 minutes. If the certificate
comes to hand he may be on the way to
England by the time this sees print. If
it doesn’t arrive this week the pilots’
pilot says he’ll have to withdraw from
the centenary race. If that should
happen, and if any blame rests on
Pearce’s department, Australia will have
something to say.
D. H. Souter is just en-
tering his fourth decade as
Bulletin artist. His cat
is a year or two younger :
the Office Antiquary says
it first appeared in its
present form in an illus-
tration called “The Bride’s
First Pie” in July, 1896.
A busy Sydney journalist
as well as black-and-white
man (he is on “Country
Life”), Souter is from
Aberdeen. He owns to 72,
but doesn’t look it. The
only artist with a longer
record of Bulletin ser-
vice is B. E. Minns.
Charles Beauclerk,
eleventh Duke of St.
Albans, had little luck in
spite of his heirship to
many titles and more or
less great possessions. The
cable announcing his
death said that the descen-
dant of Charles 11. and
Nell Gwynne had died in
rigid seclusion of a long
and excruciatingly painful
disease. Years ago the
Duke was well known in
Maoriland as a handsome
and dashing horseman.
Old hands can still tell how, as Lord Bur-
ford, he rode for a wager against time
across 250 miles of the roughest coun-
try in the North Island and won his bet.
One of his jobs was a bit out of the
common ; he was Hereditary Grand Fal-
coner of England.
Ittam&r Ben Avi is the first official
visitor to Australia from the only 100
per cent. Jewish city in the world. He
is editor of the Palestine “Daily Mail,”
published in Tel Aviv, a city of 110,000
people, standing where, 30 years ago,
there were only shifting sand dunes. Pure
Hebrew is spoken at Tel Aviv —there
was actually a difficulty in making some
of the people abandon Yiddish. Al-
though the new Hebrew University is at
Jerusalem and historical associations
maintain its importance, Tel Aviv is vir-
tually the capital of Jewish Palestine ;
it has beaten Jaffa for the ownership of
a port, all artificially made, and is a
fine garden city in spite of the sandiness
of its foundations. Amongst other things
it keeps an opera-house going all the
year round.
Dan Green, here revealed by Finey,
is Australia’s answer to Sir Basil Zaha-
roff, the mystery man of Europe. Dan
has been before the people of three
States for upwards of 45
years, yet few know
whether Dan lives in
Brisbane, Sydney or Mel-
bourne ; or what his tele-
phone number is in any of
those cities; or what he
does; or where he was
born; or where he went
to school. One of the
most mysterious things
about him is his age. Dan
Green played an impor-
tant part in the Coning-
ham divorce case of 35
years ago or thereabouts.
All the other protagonists are dead, but
Dan, according to members of the
Nothing Under Ninety Club, looks much
the same now as he did then.
Major-General Jim Spens, dead in
England at 81, commanded many Aus-
tralians in South Africa (1899-1902),
and later in Egypt—he was G.O.C. Aus-
tralian training depot, Cairo, and G.O.C.
Cairo district. A veteran of Afghanis-
tan and N.-W. Frontier campaigns, he
was one of the most successful flying-
column commanders in South Africa,
He, Garrett and Plumer generally worked
together, and rivalry between the
columns, which all included Australian
troops, was keen. In Cairo, his favorite

haunt after toil was the billiard-room at
Shepheard’s. Anyone strolling in there
about 6 p.m. was always invited to a
game if the general was not already set.
It was considered bad form to beat him,
but as ivory balls, to which few Aus-
tralians are accustomed, were always
used, if was not easy to do so if one
wanted to. The old gentleman was
always good for a gin and bitters with
his defeated opponent. Whether the latter
was a junior sub. or a brass-hat made
no difference to him.
Harry Gregory, M.H.R. for Swan, has
.been in Parliament continuously since
1897 except for one brief spell in 1912.
A determined fighter, he has lost only
two elections in his political career, and
on the first occasion he successfully peti-
tioned against the winner and regained
the seat. Fifteen and a half years in
the Westralian Assembly and 21 in the
House of Reps, is Gregory’s record ; he
arrived in State politics at the same time
as Senator Kingsmill, and they sat to-
gether in the first post-Forrest Ministry.
The veteran is 74.
H. G. Noble, owner of Noblevale and
other collieries in Ipswich (Q.) district, is
dead in Brisbane. A Londoner, he reached
Queensland as a lad, and was chief clerk
for Howard Smith before he struck out
for himself as colliery agent and mine-
owner. Fond of racing, Noble owned
a good galloper in imported Lanius;
golf also interested him—he was a life
member of Royal Queensland. And he
was Vice-Consul for*Finland.
George Aiston, who brought five
Centralian abos. to the Outback Aus-
tralia Exhibition at Melbourne Town
Hall, was responsible for the troupe of
two which put in an appearance in the Vic.
metropolis a few years ago. They were
put on show at the Museum, where they
solemnly went through the ceremony of
making fire for the benefit of sightseers
and then lit each other’s Capstans with
a Bryant and May’s ; an electric radiator
kept the great open spaces in which they
were supposed to be roaming at a suit-
able temperature. Aiston has squatted
in the Maree country through more
droughts than he cares to remember, and
at one time lost every head of cattle on
his station. He is also Protector of Abo-
rigines in those parts.

Over.the decade to the close of accounts
in 1928, paid capital advanced from
£400,000 to £1,200,000 by par issues, and
the div. from 8 p.c. to 10 p.c. Earnings
reached their peak in the following year,
when N. S. Wales developed its biggest
thirst. Then slump, growth of unem-
ployment, the fall in value of hotel free-
holds, leases and rentals, and stinging in-
creases in excise, income and other taxes
brought about an abrupt contraction of
earnings, which reached their lowest
point in 1932, when the div. had dropped
to 6 p.c.
There has since been a steady im-
provement in conditions generally. This
became more marked during the last
term, owing to the rise in the price of
wool, Government spending on public
works, a little relief from taxation
and growth of employment—unem-
ployment has fallen from Over 33 p.c.
to 25 p.c. or thereabouts during the last
two years. After a persistent fall for
four years, gross earnings improved

There have been changes in the manage-
ment, but better trading conditions, sav-
ings following alterations in the method
of distribution of the co.’s products—
Marks and Saulwick, who are interested
in other units of the A.K.M.-Yarra Falls
group, used to be sole distributors —and
improved returns from shareholdings
were mainly responsible for the hearten-
ing spring of £34,907 in the year’s net
earnings. These more than doubled,
reaching 10.8 p.c. on capital (the highest
since 1929) as against 4.4, 4.9, 5.5, 10.3,
13.5, 14.3 and 15.9 p.c. back to 1927.
That leaves out of the reckoning a profit
of £BBO3 on the sale of 8500 Yarra Falls
shares, which was sent direct to “special
reserve.” The final div. was doubled,
being at the rate of 10 p.c. p.a., making
1\ p.c. for the year, as against 5 p.c.
for each of the three preceding terms and
an average of 10.2 p.c., .sweetened with
£90,000 of bonus scrip, for the nine years
to the close of accounts in 1930.
Though competition is aggressive, the
co. is very well equipped to get its full
share of whatever business offers, and
there is nothing in sight at the moment
to suggest a sharp contraction of turn-
over (the co. specialises in underwear and
other knitted goods) or shrinkage in re-
turns from investments. These now in-
clude 310,000 pound shares (425. 6d. on
the market) in Yarra Falls, 25,000 in
Austral Silk and Cotton, 65,250 (ss.
making 15s. in all, was paid on 25,250 of
them during the term) in Julius Kayser
(Aus.) Pty., and an undisclosed but small
holding in Rayon Pty. The lot figures in
the books at par, £394,936, down £1865.
Over the twelvemonth the market
lengthened its bid for the scrip from 255.
9d. .to 31s. 6d. Allowing for the final
div. (Is. per share), the return at the
higher figure is 4.9 p.c. on a 1\ p.c. div.
basis, with prospects. The cover is visibly
265. 7d. in net tangibles, mainly plant,
etc., with a very good earning record.

figures show it:

The year’s surplus earnings, sale of
Yarra Falls scrip and a reduction of
£34,990 in debtors’ balances enabled the
board to lop £40,935 off the amount
coming to sundry creditors, etc. —the
etcetera is provision for taxation —and
add £24,198 to the book value of stocks.
The improvement in the more or less
liquid surplus (£178,181, including
stocks) was £29,605.

During the three years to the close of
accounts in 1932, this big Brisbane re-
tailer made additions and extensions to
the Valley corner of its premises, and
more people came to the store ; the co.
bought the stocks of southern and other
traders who withdrew from the rag busi-
ness in the northern capital, and “bene-
ficial arrangements” were made with
Foy and Gibson’s Victorian mills. Thus
slump and competition from Queen-
street, where Finneys, Coles, Woolworths
and others are exerting a pull, were
a little slow to make their full effect's
felt upon McWhirters’ figures. Half-way
through the 1933 term things looked
good enough to pay an interim 2 p.e.,
but a flood of Japanese imports affected
the co.’s stocks of silks, rayon and
cotton piece-goods, etc., and, after tak-
ing stocks into account at £25,092 below
the 1932 figure, the year’s operations re-
sulted in a loss of £4OOO.
However, the lines affected were sold
“regardless of cost” or written down to
their market value, thus giving the co.
a clear start for the last term. Prices
were steadier, business improved and the
co. reports that it “participated in public
patronage to a degree above the aver-
age.” Gross earnings sprang £20,312:
1928. 1932. 1933. 1934.

Net profit.. £76,001 £29,169 £1,947 £26,398
A tight hold was kept upon exes., down
£4139. After setting aside £4250 for the
taxgatherer, enough remained to show a
shade over 4 p,c. on capital, compared
with a loss and then profits of 5, 6.5,
11.8, 13.6, 13.6 and 14.3 p.e. back to
1927, and 4 p.e. was distributed.
It was better than the market expected,
and the pound shares, which had fallen
to 11s. 7d. a year ago, advanced from
18s. to 19s. following publication of the
accounts. The return at 19s. is 4.2 p.e.
on a 4 p.e. div. basis, and the cover 245.
in net tangibles.
Subject to unforeseen developments,
turnover is expected to further improve
during the current term, but competition
promises to keep margins narrow, and
anything more than a slight increase in
the div. rate is doubtful.
There is nothing to worry about in
the finances:

Substantial improvement in the invest-
ment value of the prefs. is the outstand-
ing feature since 1930, when Carreras,
Ltd., the big English concern which
turns out Craven A and other lines of
tobacco, took control and the name was
changed to its present title. Originally,
Sniders and Abrahams, formed in 1919,
the co. reconstructed as G. G. Goode in
1923, and there was a further clean-up
three years later. Altogether the ords.
lost 9s. of each 10s. share, and the pref.
div. was lifted from 8 p.c. to 10 p.c. in
return for cancellation of dividend
arrears. For the next four years net
earnings were little more than the prefs.
called for. Then exchange, the tariff
and rationing of tobacco imports pro-
vided an opportunity to link up with the
English co., which bought 75,098 un-
issued Is. ords. for 10s. each (the pre-
mium, £33,794, was sent to reserves).
This and the purchase of Morris and
Johnson’s business (they were distri-
butors of the co.’s products in N. S.
Wales) for £20,000 in prefs. a year or so
ago lifted paid capital to its present
figure—£7B,ooo in 68,000 £1 10 p.c. cum.
prefs. and the balance Is. ords.
Since manufacture under British trade-
marks began, there has been a big jump
in turnover, and gross earnings have
nearly trebled, reaching £113,947 (up
£15,058) for the last term. Over the same
period net earnings have more than
trebled. Last year’s £18,558 (up £7285)
more than 2| times covered the pref.
div., after allowing for which enough
remained to show 117.5 p.c. on ord. capi-
tal, and 43.7 p.c. was distributed. But
share premiums make 43.7 p.c. worth no
more than 10 p.c. on capital and pre-
mium money combined.
When the English interests came in the
co. built itself a home. To do this,
modernise the plant and carry more
stocks it went into debt:

put the co. in a better position to com-
pete for business in Westralia, where
prospects are considered to be encourag-
ing, a new factory was erected at Vic-
toria Park. But these works were not
kept fully employed during the second
half of the term, and the plants at Lane
Cove (N.S.W.) and Footscray (Vic.)
worked only part time, too. After strik-
ing off £2634 more than was spent on
plant, the net result was a trifle lighter
at 3.8 p.c. on capital as against 3.9 p.c.
and 1.8 p.c. for the two preceding terms.
No final div. was paid, the average over
the last 10 years being 5.8 p.c.
There is nothing to worry about in the
finances:

The more or less liquid surplus (£25,059)
improved £1449. All plant is reported in
good condition, and much depends upon
that.
Contracts in hand are expected to be
completed by the end of 1934, and com-
petition remains very keen, which, of
course, means narrow margins. Gov-
ernment and local government bodies,
however, are now spending a bit more
on water-supply schemes, etc., and since
the wood pipe has special advantages the
co. can be expected to get its full share
of whatever business is to be had.
The pound shares are offered at 13s.
9d., the return at that figure being 3.6
p.c. on a 2j p.c. div. basis. The cover is
21s. in net tangibles, mainly fixed assets,
worth what they can earn.
At Tennant’s Creek, Centralia, the finds
are rich on the surface, and there is a
fair quantity of ore in sight, but whether
values live at depth has yet to be proved.
Also, the chances of getting stone avail-
able crushed are small, there being no
Government battery on the field. This
means that many prospectors are held
up for want of working capital, unless
an option is taken over their leases. R.
Schmidt, of Alroy station, who has be-
come interested in several of the rich-
est shows and has taken options over
others, intends to erect some stamps, but
it is doubtful whether these will crush
stone for outsiders. Another drawback
is that the warden, a policeman at Bar-
row Creek, 180 miles away, makes only
periodical visits to the field.
* * * *
At Aberfoyle Tin (Tas.) the lodes
show a tendency to improve in size and
value as they go down. Provided the
price of tin holds, prospects of a lift
in the div. are therefore encouraging.
For the year (41 weeks’ crushing) to
June 30 last the co. milled 10,234 tons
of ore for 195 tons of first concentrates
and 215 tons of seconds. The firsts
yielded 189.8 tons of 64.7 p.c. tin oxide,
and the seconds 33.1 tons of 72.4 p.c.
stuff. Together with £lO4l from the
sale of wolfram, etc., they turned in
£35,150, tin averaging £225 10s. (ster-
ling). The £10,685 netted was equal to
3s. sd. per share (prefs. and ords. com-
bined), and 2s. 6d. was distributed. Surplus
liquids totalled £7340, and no further
substantial capital outlay is contemplated.
There is 12,788 tons of proved ore, to-
gether with 10,711 tons of probable
stone, on No. 1 level, and a further
45,746 tons of probable ore on No. 2,
making 68,975 tons altogether, or about
64 years’ feed for the mill at last year’s
rate of crushing ; that is without further
shaft sinking. Of the £62,500 of paid
capital, £12,500 carries a cumulative 10
p.c. with the right to advance with the
ords. beyond that rate.
* * ❖ *
Developments at the Little 180, Ben-
digo (Vic.), are encouraging. For the
six months to the end of July, the co.
crushed 5695 tons, averaging 3jdwt., for
a working profit of £3BBl. It has since
put through 1431 tons for 6710 z. of gold,
an average of over 9dwt. The improve-
ment in value has occurred in a sec-
tion under and south of the diagonal
fault, whereas all previous workings
below the 500 ft. level were on or north
of the diagonal. This probably means
that the major portion of the most pro-
ductive zone in the mine remains intact
below the 500 ft. level. The zone is to
be tested, and, if results are good
enough, an additional 10-head of stamps
will be installed, enabling 2000 tons of
stone to be crushed monthly, or double
the present figure. A first div. of Is.
per share has been declared, payable
October 5.
* * * *
Lake Austin -Eureka Co., nominal
capital £40,000 in 2s. shares, is on the
market in Perth with 150,000 of them ;
100,000 paids plus £3500 cash go to the
vendor, and the other 150,000 are in
pickle. Shareholders are to be given a
one for two par option till the end of
March, 1935. The property (31 acres)
includes the Eureka and the main por-
tion of the Island Queen, both near
Austin, on the Murchison field (W.A.).
In the past 27,441 tons of ore yielded
24,455 oz of gold. At 140 ft. the
main shaft (it goes down to 315 ft.) cuts
a 10ft. wide lode, assaying sdwf.; this
has not yet been worked. Another schist
lode, about 150 ft. east of the Eureka
reef, goes from 4dwt. to sdwt., over a
width of 15ft., at a depth of 45ft. Also,
a quartzite bar, 40ft. to 50ft. wide, out-
crops for the full length of the property ;
it continues into the adjoining show,
where it has yielded lOdwt. In addition
there is a “large quantity” of alluvial
cement, estimated to average 34dwt. over
the plates, which the co. figures to treat
at an all-in cost of 13s. a ton.
De Bernales’s groups of London-con-
trolled Westralian goldmines, bossed by
H. J. Urquhart, are either being bored
or sampled, or about to be. Prospects of
some are impressive, and there is none
that hasn’t a chance. Anglo-Australian,
the initial float, is about to place its first
subsidiary, the Beryl, at Phillips River,
on the market. Drilling results on this
property have been consistently good in
new ground at depth, and there is a
fairly large tonnage of payable ore in
the old workings. Other occupants of
the Anglo-Australian stable are the
Apex, near Nullagine; the Wheel of
Fortune and Day Dawn, near Cue, and
the Mars, at Nannine. Drilling is pro-
ceeding on the first and last of these.
North Kalgurli United, float No. 2,
is having its recently unwatered levels
sampled preparatory to reprospecting.
Old reports suggest that a lot of payable
ore may be found in the reopened work-
ings. There is also a good prospect of
the northern continuation of North Kal-
gurli’s main gold carrier being found in
United’s ground. Float No. 3, Southern
Cross Development, is expected to have
an important borehole development
placed to its credit within the next few
weeks. Float No. '4, Commonwealth
Finance, and No. 5, Murchison Gold
Development, are preparing to do things
in a big way, and, backed by reports
from experts of standing, are confident
of results.

The Swan Bitter G.M., Jonesville
(W.A.), which a few years ago changed
hands for a case of beer, and more re-
cently for £15,000, has milled about 600
tons for an average of nearly 2oz. of
gold by amalgamation; tailings assay
approximately the same. Looked at as a
mine, the show might be expected to
average 15dwt. or more over a width
of 30ft. to a depth of 50ft. Values at
greater depth and over a length remain
to be proved. The co. also has an option
over the adjoining lease, the North End
G.M., where a five-head has been run-
ning continuously for the past two years.
Here a prospecting shaft sunk to a depth
of 34 feet disclosed lOdwt. values over
a width of 25ft., with no walls showing.
A parcel of 150 tons is to be crushed to
verify this. A free option has been
granted to the Mt. Morgan Co. over 156
acres of adjoining ground.

Wiluna’s August return was its best
monthly achievement yet, the profit
amounting to £55,033. Working costs,
including 2s. 6d. per ton for de-
velopment, averaged 18s. 6d. An interest-
ing feature of recent developments is the
discovery, at the 625 ft. level, of a big
payable ore-body between the west and
No. 2 west lodes. At the moment it is not
certain whether this is a separate ore-
body or a spur from one of the two
lodes mentioned.

Lake View and Star (W.A.) has com-
pleted plans for retreatment of the big
dumps of tailings on the recently ac-
quired Associated mine. A large plant
is to be installed, and it is expected to be
in operation early in 1935. There is
between 1,500,000 tons and 2,000,000
tons of stuff awaiting treatment, and it
is reckoned to contain sufficient gold to
show aggregate profits running well into
six figures.

Australian Mining Trust, whose head-
quarters is in Sydney, has taken an
option over the Celebration mine, at'
Celebration, Hampton Plains (W.A.).
The purchase price is £lB,OOO, and the
deposit, which has been paid, £2OOO.
About 22,000 tons of ore was mined
from the show in the past for 94000 z.
The co. is also negotiating for an option
over Hannan’s Hill Amalgamated leases,
Kalgoorlie, which were recently turned
down by the Champagne Syndicate, of
Melbourne. The property includes the
old Hannan’s Reward lease.

Princess Royal, which bought McKen-
zie and Hall’s Salvation leases, Grant’s
Patch (W.A.), now under option to Ora
Banda Amalgamated, is negotiating for
additional property near by. The co.’s
Dixie group of leases, Broad Arrow
(W.A.), is likely to be soon offered to the
public.
Gold Reefs and Adelaide Options are
developing four leases at Balgarrie, Ora
Banda district (W.A.). An amalgama-
tion of the leases is in progress ; values
on one of them are stated to be from
lOdwt. to 13dwt. over a width of 10ft.
Five shafts are being sunk.

It has been emphasised more than
once on this page that developments at
North Kalgurli (W.A.) justified treat-
ment of a larger tonnage, and the man-
agement at last concurs. The quantity of
ore sent to the mill this month will show
a substantial increase, while that to be
put through next month is expected to
be bulkier still.

South Kalgurli receives a tribute from
North Kalgurli in respect of the Croesus
Prop, blocks, at the north end of the
Golden Mile (W.A.), which has still
several years to run. Last year North’s
share of the profits, which are divided
equally, was £9975.

Western Mining Corporation has taken
a twelvemonth’s option over the North
Enterprise Development Syndicate’s pro-
perty at Davyhurst (W.A.). The terms
are £2OO cash, payable Oct. 1, and £2OOO
in fully-paids in any co. formed to work
the property.

Bardoc Consolidated has taken over
three 24-acre leases near Broad Arrow
railway station (W.A.). The properties
contain dumps aggregating about 3000
tons assaying from 2dwt. to 9dwt. a ton.
A trial parcel of six tons averaged sdwt.
sgr. Erection of a treatment plant is
under consideration.
The promotion of hand-to-mouth
gold-mining cos. continues in Wes-
tralia and elsewhere. Some will have
few financial feathers to fly with after
the vendors and promoters have grabbed
their share and flotation expenses have
been paid. Shows are being floated
on what they, or something near by, have
produced in the past, and not upon what
is likely to be got out of them in the
future.

The Financial Chart-Guide to Busi-
ness Analysis, put out by Hemingway
and Robertson, the Australian account-
ancy coaches and consultants, is the
most concise and complete thing of its
kind yet published. It consists of 20
quarto pages, full of meat for all who
want to know how to marshal and inter-
pret the figures, etc., of a balance-sheet,
so as to get a business into proper per-
spective. Its value lies in the fact that
it helps to eliminate confused thinking,
and therefore aids correct conclusions.

arable land ? (2) What compensation could
the landholder expect? —3l64.
(I) Under well-conducted dredging methods
a system of resoiling can be carried out which
will practically return the ground dredged to
its former condition; in some instances the
ground has been improved for cultivation pur-
poses. (2) Compensation for surface damage
is assessed by the Mining Warden before a
lease is granted for dredging purposes. This
is calculated according to the value of the land.

Murphy ,
T& FIRST DEPOSITOR IN
THE FIRST BANK
ON April 8, 1817, when the Bank of New
South Wales opened for business, the first
customer was Sergeant Jeremiah Murphy, of the
46th Regiment of Foot. He deposited £5O. He
was followed by Mr. John Harris, of Ultimo,
Sydney, and Mr. William Redfem, of Sydney,
one of the first Directors of the Bank.
By January, 1818, deposits had increased to
£1,859 and the Bank had advanced £1,381 on
mortgages to its customers.
To-day deposits held by the Bank of New South
Wales total over £86,000,000, whilst advances to
customers are over £65,000,000.
Thus, the individual depositor plays a vital part
in the financing of the country's production and
trade. As deposits increase the Bank is enabled
to extend still further its financial assistance to
industry.

mind the very rich crushings which have come out of these workings in the past and right
up to the present day, and also the fact that there are large quantities of loam and cement
on the surface which are readily available for treatment, and the fact that there are several
large unexplored lodes all carrying gold, am of the opinion that you are the owners of a very
valuable property.”

“Catherine the Great”
As an entertainment “Catherine the
Great,” directed by Paul Czinner, is one
of this year’s outstanding screen achieve-
ments. The narrative flows smoothly, and
settings, though elaborate, are not al-
lowed to overwhelm the plot. It is a
clean-cut, polished production without an
inch of superfluous celluloid.
Historically, it won’t hold water. Cath-
erine is introduced at the beginning as
an unsophisticated maiden. Actually she
was a capable and designing female, even
at the age of 14, who had made up her
mind to wear a Russian crown. She
deserted Protestantism, spared no effort
to ingratiate herself with the Empress
Elizabeth and the Grand Duke, and
made herself ill by overstudy of the Rus-
sian language—all to that purpose. Her
meeting with Peter in the film is a musi-
cal-comedy touch with no basis in fact.
She spent a year at least in Russia before
her marriage. After her marriage her
flagrant immorality was the talk of the
Western world. The film presents her
philanderings as innocent ruses to bring
Peter to her side. In the political in-
trigues that preceded Peter’s downfall
she is made to take a demure and subor-
dinate part. History says she instigated
the plots.
Peter is similarly bowdlerised. He was
a degenerate, made hideous by small-
pox and loathsome in his habits. The
screen Peter has fits of petulance and
a streak of boorishness, but is endowed
with a handsome face and athletic grace,
and is permitted moments of tenderness
and good humor. His exit is represented
as a gallant withdrawal. History says he
crawled out in cowardly fashion.
But, though the Empress, played by
Elizabeth Bergner, and the Peter of the
younger Fairbanks belie history, Flora
Robson’s dominating and amorous Em-
press Elizabeth makes it live, and Gerald
du MaurieFs Lecocq, Irene Vanbrugh’s
Princess Anhalt-Zerbst, Diana Napier’s
Countess Vorontzova and Gibb Mc-
Laughlin’s Bestujher fulfil all historical
and histrionic requirements. At Sydney
Embassy.
“The Warren Case”
Another of those “perfect crimes” that
come ungummed just after the wrongly-
accused hero has been sentenced to
death. British International did this one,
which is at Sydney Capitol. The cast-
ing is good.
Richard Bird is a semi-mad, usu-
ally drunk reporter, known in Fleet-
street as “The Ace of Crime.” To keep
his job he plots the murder of his mis-
tress, arranging for circumstantial evi-
dence to point to the young man to
whom his employer’s daughter is en-
gaged. This young man, just before the
murder is committed, is doped with a
mixture of whisky, methylated spirits and
Apolinaris which reduces him to such
a condition that he remembers nothing
till he wakes up, when there are two grim
men from Scotland Yard waiting to take
him into custody. There are trial scenes,
and for once in a way they do accu-
rately reproduce the English method of
criminal procedure and the atmosphere
of the courts, even to little brushes be-
tween Judge and counsel and the dry
humor that sometimes seeps out of a
ponderous K.C. After a trial which
ended with a bit of black silk on the
’judge’s wig, the police (who perhaps
were too busy earlier) read the news-
paper accounts of the crime, and decide
that Bird must have known a lot more
about the murdered girl’s apartment than
a total stranger should. He wrote up the
murder as soon as he committed it, hav-
ing told the office half an hour earlier
to keep the front page open. He did not
even pay a return visit, with the police,
to the scene of his crime. Putting these
twos and twos together, the police place
the ace under arrest. He escapes for
long enough to ’phone the office his con-
fession and announce his suicide, and
then jumps out of a fifth-floor window.
The acting covers the weaknesses of
the plot.
“Gambling Lady”
She is Barbara Stanwyck. Her poor
old pop, who always played them straight
and on the up and up, suicided when
faced with the alternatives of bank-
ruptcy and dealing from a faked deck.
So she gets a job as a professional poker-
player for a gang of crooks, still keep-
ing to pop’s rule about not helping the
cards. Thus she meets millionaire's son
Joel McCrea, and marries him. To save
him from a murder charge, she has to
promise to divorce him (the lady who
can provide an alibi insists), and her
heartbroken state of mind is indicated
by frequent snatches of lugubrious music.
It all turns out right in the end, with a
great big kiss for fade-out. A bright
spot is Pat O’Brien as a bookie, and an-
other is C. Aubrey Smith as a wealthy
old sport.
“Twenty Million Sweethearts”
The crooner-hero Dick Powell is a
singing waiter when voluble Pat O'Brien
lures him from restaurant to micro-
phone. Powell
flops in the early
stages of his
radio career,
but, aided by
Ginger Rogers,
who carols on
the Carl o 11 a
Soap pro-
gramme,. he
makes good,
goes from
strength to
strength, eroti-
cally speaking,
and is yearned
for by 20 mil-
lion female list-
eners.
Comes the
announce-
ment of his
marriage to
Miss Rogers.
Twenty million
American wo-
men are heart-
broken, and all
Pat O’Brien’s
intrigues are set
at naught. Des-
perately does
O’Brien strive
to separate the
young people in
the combined
interests of Art
and Finance,
but it’s no good.
Powell dis-
appears from
the air.
O’Brien —a master-hustler —stages the
hero’s comeback in a Long Island
cabaret in conjunction with Miss Rogers,
and the 20 million take them both to
their hearts.
Dick Powell is a pleasant-looking youth
with a tuneful voice. Ginger Rogers
hasn’t much to do, but her figure shows
to great advantage. The Four Mills
Brothers have about the best' turn in the
show. At Sydney Regent.
“Fog Over ’Frisco”
An involved melodrama with Bette
Davis as a neurotic lass who gets mixed
up with a ruthless crook. Murder, kid-
napping and bond-stealing provide the
thrills, and everybody talks and moves
at a terrific pace. Margaret Lindsay is
good as the misguided heroine’s helpful
half-sister.
“Man of Aran”
A fine thing this. It more than shows
life on Aran, a speck in the heaving
Atlantic; it makes the spectator live
that life: thrill with the fisherboy land-
ing his catch; man the oars and sweep
the frail boat out from the cliffs over
the sunlit sea; hurl the harpoon into
the basking shark and battle with it two
days; slash out its liver, to render it
down over the peat-fire for oil to light a
thatched, whitewashed cot. When storm
rages a stolid woman gathers seaweed
into a huge basket on her back, waiting
for her man’s return on the crest of the
cliffward-tearing waves. She shouts
above the howling wind to guide him to
the tiny haven and helps to drag him
ashore when his boat is dashed on to
the rock.
There is a musical accompaniment into
which have been woven ancient airs
of Ireland, the thrum of pounding sea
and the cries of wheeling seagulls.
Robert Flaherty made it. There are
groups filled with homely figures that are
like pictures come to life. It’s at Sydney
Lyceum.
“Princess Charming”
It heads the bill at the Lyceum —an
Evelyn Laye musical romance as false as
an electioneering promise. Evelyn is a
princess of a Land of Neverwas, and is
going to marry a bankrupt king. This is
George Grossmith, an oasis in a desert
of futility. But the princess’s kingdom is
plunged into revolution, led by a Hitler-
esque dictator. She marries wooden-
faced Henry Wilcoxon, come to take her
to his king ; after a lot of fooling for
which Max Miller is responsible, she

goes back to rule her kingdom, leaving
King Grossmith and Mistress Yvonne
Arnaud happy together again.
“Midnight”
The talkies have introduced us to
dozens of quaint American customs.
“Midnight,” at Sydney Civic, presents
yet another. A woman is condemned to
death for shooting her lover, the con-
viction being mainly attributable to a
searching question by the foreman of the
jury. The blather press rouses public
opinion on her behalf by devoting
columns to such details as what she eats
for breakfast. On the night of the execu-
tion a crowd gathers outside the. fore-
man’s house ; a reporter anxious for a
scoop bribes one of the family to invite
him inside as a friend and to tune-
in to a broadcast of the execution,
done on much the same lines as a Test
match narration. The condemned
woman’s last meal is described —the way
she walks through the cell door, her
answers to the reporters. About the
same moment the foreman’s daughter,
an imaginative damsel of 18 or so, shoots
her lover. The finish is neat.
The thing is capably done. O. P.
Heggie plays the foreman, a very ordi-
nary individual, who, not unreasonably,
thinks murder should be' punished. Sid-
ney Fox is his daughter, and Henry Hull
a credible newspaperman. Minor parts
are equally well looked after.
“The Poor Rich”
Also at the Civic. Comedy by Edna
May Oliver and Edward Everett Horton
as the P.R. They come back to their
ancestral home broke to the wide. Come
also an international crook masquerad-
ing as an Indian prince, and an aristo-
cratic English family—also on the rocks
and determined to marry E. E. Horton
to their daughter—and a nice girl who
agrees to act as maid. The deputy-sheriff
of the county is constrained to be butler,
a cheerful idiot is impounded to do ser-
vice as cook, and flitting through the
story is a mug detective. At the finish
they pair off, but not according to plan.
“Footlight Parade”
James Cagney is the working partner
of a theatrical firm, and is being sys-
tematically robbed by his two colleagues,
while, through a leakage of information,
a rival firm is continually stealing his
ideas. Given three days to prepare a
series of prologues for a big chain of
talkie theatres, he declares a state of siege
at the theatre, allowing nobody to leave
until the night of the try-out. His girl
secretary, Joan Blondell, who is in love
with him, reveals to him his partners’
trickery, and Cagney calls their bluff. He
forces them to agree to his terms, puts
on the prologues and secures the con-
tract.
The plot drags at times, but the pro-
logues when they eventually appear
atone for earlier shortcomings. They are
on such a scale that no theatre in the
world could possibly stage them, far
less a talkie house ; but that is beside
the point.
Cagney is generally convincing, and
gets plenty of support from Miss Blon-
dell. He stars in one of the prologues.
Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell sing and
dance attractively. Guy Kibbee and
Hugh Herbert have less to do than usual,
but do it very well. At Sydney State.
“Upper World”
Also at the State. Warren William
controls a big railway corporation. His
tastes outside business hours are not ex-
pensive. Those of his wife, Mary Astor,
are, and she climbs into the top branches
of the social tree. William meets Ginger
Rogers, a little chorus girl who repre-
sents to him an escape from social con-
ventions. Their affair is brought to a
tragic conclusion by the intervention of
a blackmailer. Ginger is shot dead in
saving William, who in turn shoots the
blackmailer. Heavy melodrama. A
policeman with a grudge, finger-prints
and other weapons engineers William’s
arrest and trial. He is acquitted on
grounds of self-defence, is reconciled to
Mary, now repentant of her neglect of
him, and they set off for Europe on a
second honeymoon. All three principals
act splendidly, and Andy Devine as a
chauffeur is droll and entertaining. Sid-
ney Toler, as the zealous policeman who
is sacrificed on the altar of Big Business,
introduces a word that is new to this
critic. He gets “demoted,” which is the
reverse of promoted in the American
language of to-day.
“Blossom Time”
Richard Tauber’s magnificent voice is
rolling off the Melbourne Majestic screen
in Schubert’s exquisite lyrics this week.
It is a voice so celestially rich and warm
and yet so unnaturally loud that obvi-
ously somebody with a machine has done
something to it; yet while the quantity
is enhanced, the quality is not strained.
Tauber’s voice and Schubert’s music
are conscripted in the service of a re-
markably silly story, in which molasses
is at a premium and reality at a dis-
count. Schubert is depicted as the same
sort of sentimental idiot as he was in
“Lilac Time.” Yet it cannot be gainsaid
{Continued on page 40.)


THE OTHER
FELLOW'S
MIND.
Trains and Tracks
I am not rejoicing at the news that a
heap of loan money is to be spent in
order that people may travel from
Sydney to Newcastle in 2hr. 16min.
instead of 2hr. 46min. Already trains
roll alarmingly, it is difficult to stand
up and the liquid refreshments served
are sometimes to be found on the
floor of the compartment instead of in
the interior of the passenger. And the
noise is deafening. The department con-
soles us with pleasant murmurings about
heavier rolling stock and more powerful
locomotives to be used when the faster
schedule becomes operative; but the real
trouble is the track. Welding it into
200-yard lengths or 5000-yard lengths
won’t make much difference to anything
except the noise. Even the promise to
relay throughout with 1001 b. rails is deal-
ing simply with a matter of wear and
tear.
The essence of high-speed railway
travel is safety. High speeds are not
safe on the existing track. They won’t
be safe until it is chaired throughout,
until hazardous curves are eliminated
and curves retained are banked like a
speedway. The present method of spik-
ing the track won’t do, though in order
for low speeds. The amount of pres-
sure which high speed puts on to the
track is apt to rip the spikes out and
leave the rails unattached.
One thing the N.S.W. authorities may
learn from their baby sister in West-
ralia. The Westralian railways have
never killed a passenger.—Puff Puff
(Newcastle, N.S.W:).
Wool Bill Financing
With wool prices low (B. 29/8/’34)
graziers have to make a saving where
they can.' To most, the rate of interest
means a lot. The Commonwealth Wool
Committee said:
The wool industry needs the lowest
, rates of interest on its borrowed capital
that business prudence can provide.
Apparently no differentiation has been
made between rates of interest charged
on long-term borrowing and on first-class
“self-liquidating” securities like wool,
except on shippers’ consignments. The
“Economist” (24/3/’34) says that “some
large and well-known manufacturing
concerns are already discounting their
own trade bills at less than 1 per cent.,”
and further:
It is in every way desirable that the
inland bill should come into greater use.
It would mean cheaper financing for the
home trade of the country, to the benefit
of producer and consumer alike.
For various reasons, it would probably
be better for Australian wool bills,
backed by the Commonwealth Bank, to
be discounted in the London bill market,
where, in view of the excess of short-
term money awaiting investment, the
rate of interest would be very low indeed.
The advantages of a bill system are,
firstly, that the rate of interest on clip
advances would be greatly lessened and
the advance, used as. a set-off, would
lower the general rate on overdrafts.
Secondly, growers receiving prompt
payment for the clips would operate
in the store stock markets imme-
diately, which would tend to make them
more stable. Thirdly, the selling of wool
in the country to speculators would be
discouraged, as there would be no incen-
tive for graziers to accept a low price for
immediate cash when they could get
cheap finance through wool bills.
No doubt the technique of the whole
process would have to be worked out
carefully. The Commonwealth Govern-
ment might well call the Wool Commit-
tee together.— Wingen (N.S.W.).
The financing of the clip, particularly
that of the growers of late-shorn wool,
is a matter of great urgency.
Under existing conditions it is on an
average 18 months before a grower in
a late-shearing district effects sale for
any particular clip (12 months growing
and six months waiting for sale). This
involves undue strain under depression
conditions, and it is high time that pro-
vision for relief was forthcoming as
outlined in The Bulletin’s articles. I
trust your well-reasoned proposal will
be adopted.—J. A. H. (N.S.W.).
Save the Coral!
There is no danger of tourists remov-
ing the Barrier Reef in their trunks. It
is uncharted water, and no tourist ship
dares poke its bows into those seas.
Moreover, coral “hums” so dreadfully
that very few pieces would make a ship
uninhabitable.
The need for the preservation of our
coral is on islands devoted to tourists.
Trippers destroy ten times as much as
they get, and then not one in ten knows
how to cure what they’ve saved. That
is wanton destruction, and it calls for
intervention by a few keen honorary
rangers and inspectors. They would do
the work of ten times the number of
Government officials —without returns in
triplicate, superannuation allowances,
overtime and holidays on full pay with
all first-class travelling expenses.— Polyp
(N.Q.).
Shark-proof Beaches
Many schemes have been proposed,
including bombing, harpooning, fright-
ening the sharks with air bubbles, look-
"Why don’t you look for the horse?"
"Look for him. Py korry, I look so long I tired of standing still.”
out towers and electric screens. None of
these can guarantee a bather against
attack, but nets can and do. The Coogee
shark-net has withstood the break of
mountainous seas which have thrown
spray as high as the outermost tower
and over the retaining wall supporting
the roadway. It has remained secure in
weather as bad as that which any of our
ocean beaches are likely to encounter.
Finance? “Let the Government do
it,” people say; but our Governments
have too much to do as it is. Such nets
should be made financially self-support-
ing by means of a small charge on in-
dividual bathers. In places like Manly
and Bondi a charge of a penny would
cover cost of upkeep and soon wipe out
the cost of erection. The Coogee net
has been a profit-making venture for the
council. If not only keeps out sharks,
but prevents bathers being carried to
sea by the undertow. — John Dory

Extract from a letter from a relation
in Paris to whom we always send The
Bulletin :
I read your Bulletins from end to end,
and then take them to the Artists and
Students’ Club down on the “Left Bank.”
They appreciate them immensely. There
are all sorts of students there, amongst
them some Australians.
From the club your Bulletins are for-
warded to English-speaking hospitals, so
becomes a case of “not war-caused,” and
his dependants cease to draw the pen-
sion. Old-age pensioners are increasing
by leaps and bounds. The Digger is
fast fading away. Not a few have died
by their own hands, worn out by the
struggle in the country which they helped
to make safe. —Z. 4. X. (W.A.).
Depresh and the Doctor
The depression has been hard on
doctors. A dozen have told me they
can’t get their money in ; said a Collins-
street surgeon, “It’s only the poor who
are paying the doctor” —by small in-
stalments, of course. Never before has
so much service gratis been expected of
the medical profession.
From one point of view it is good to
see so eminent a figure as Melbourne’s
Colonel Rupert Downes, C.M.G., V.D.,
M.D., M.S., hon. surgeon to the G.-G.,
becoming Director-General of Medical
Services in the Defence Department, in
succession to Major-General Barber, re-
tired, but it suggests other reflections.
The job' was advertised at £l5OO
p.a., but this sum is “inclusive of all
allowances except travelling,” and is sub-
ject to periodical adjustment to varia-
tions in the cost of. living and to
financial-emergency cuts. . These bring
the present effective salary to £1217 p.a.,
and “contribution to the superannuation
fund is compulsory.” Some of the duties
are administration, organisation, train-
they never stop. My best thanks for send-
ing them so regularly; and many a poor
chap in hospital sends thanks also.
—K. M. O. (N.S.W.).
The Digger with T.B.
As a t.b. pensioner let me thank you
for those articles, “Pensioners First”
(B. 11/7/’34) and “The Case for the
Digger” (B. 18/7/’34). Without losing
sight of the many other disabilities of
returned soldiers and sailors, I maintain
that the t.b. case requires special con-
sideration ; he is not only incapacitated
but is practically unemployable. The
Board of Health sees to this (and rightly,
too), but it narrows the field of selection
for a light job.
The t.b. pensioner’s complaint is not
localised, as is an amputation; it
gradually undermines the whole consti-
tution. The digestive organs become so
impaired that slow starvation is the out-
look for many; still you will find super-
optimists amongst the “Wog Artists.”
Not cheerful and happy as a class, but
they keep their troubles to themselves.
Their dependants are the great sufferers.
From this you will see that I am not
in accord with the views of “Pensioner”
(B. 1/8/’34), who asks “Where is it all
going to end?” and “If an old-age pen-
sioner decides to face the matrimonial
barrier does he automatically get his
missus a pension?” In the majority of
cases the old-age pensioner’s missus
would already be drawing a pension ;
and should he go out by self-caused death
(which Heaven forbid!) she continues to
draw it. But if a Digger takes his life it
ing and mobilisation arrangements for
army medical services; also control and
administration of R.A.A.F. and Civil
Aviation Branch medical service. Pri-
vate practice is not permitted. As a final
inducement (?) it was announced that the
successful applicant would have to live
at Canberra should army headquarters
be removed to that city during his tenure
of office. — Figsen (Vic.).
Westralian Wheat Payments
Eight months have elapsed since the
harvest, yet Westralian wheat-farmers
are still waiting for final distribution of
the Commonwealth bounty. They have
received 3s. an acre, and there is a further
sixpence to come —some day! An
amount of £65,000, set aside for neces-
sitous cases, also awaits distribution. It
was announced by some State authority
that no payment would be made to
farmers who had cars. A protest by the
Wheatgrowers’ Union elicited the reply
from the Commonwealth that no such
condition had been imposed. It is en-
tirely a State matter.
Westralia has a lot of young settlers
who have not yet been able to go in for
sidelines, and the slump has hit them
hard.—A. G. T. (W.A.).
Transport and Taxes
It would be interesting to know what
the N.S.W. Stevens Government owes to
Lang policy. Messrs. Bruxner, Mad-
docks and Hartigan all claim wonderful
“success” for the Transport Board; but
they have not mentioned that this “suc-
cess” is based on the policy of making
all those who compete with Government
transport pay taxes.
Our concern’s tax for the year to July
31 for only two motor vehicles was
£439 13s. 9d. You can imagine what
hundreds of other distributing people and
carriers have had to pay. No rates or
taxes are paid by the Government rail-
ways, tramways and ’buses, and the Gov-
ernment adds the insult of penalising us
for competing against it. —J. T. (Sydney).
Queensland Grammar Schools
It will be a bad day for Queensland
if Grammar Schools go (B. 5/9/’34). In
spite of defects, the English educational
system, with its variety of secondary
schools —the best not directly controlled
by the Education Department—still holds
its own. The Maorilander is generally
admitted to be a better-educated man
than the Australian; thanks to the en-
dowment of secondary education under
the Wakefield scheme, it has efficient,
locally-controlled secondary schools on
the lines of the public schools of Eng-
land.
But our Government Education De-
partment, which has set up High Schools,
would like to see the end of Grammar
Schools. They are run at least as wisely
as the High Schools ; it is suspected that
they are run more economically; but
while every penny spent on the Gram-
mar Schools has to be accounted for,
figures as to costs of establishment and
maintenance of the High Schools are un-
available. The excuse is that it is impos-
sible to separate the balance sheets of the
High Schools and the Technical Colleges.
The fine records of Brisbane Grammar
have been maintained in face of all oppo-
sition, and the smaller Grammar Schools
are doing good work, as any Queensland
University “Manual” will show. I was
told recently that the university profes-
sors would very much prefer the con-
tinuance of the Grammar Schools to
their being abolished or converted into
High Schools. One advantage they have
over the High Schools is in the possession
of a nucleus of boarders, without which
any approach to public-school life is
difficult or impossible.— Anti-Leveller
(Q.).
“Skipper Kidd”: The junior mistress
went to the senior mistress with the in-
formation that Willie had stolen an
orange from the 11 o’clock distribution
store. “He did not steal it,” was the
senior’s rebuke —“he merely had his
orange early.” She explained that, ac-
cording to the new psychology, in-
fants must not be made to believe that
they had stolen anything—the effect on
the young mind would be most injurious.
She took the matter into her own hands.
“Willie,” she said to that urchin, “I see
you are having your fruit early this
morning; you will not be able to have
an orange at 11 o’clock now.” Came
11 o’clock. The other children were en-
joying their oranges immensely. Willie’s
tongue was hanging out pathetically. At
last the ordeal proved too much for him,
and he stood up. “Aw, miss,” he
. solemnly said, “if I promise not to pinch
a norange ter-morrer could I have an-
other one now?”


ABORIGINALITIES
“Moturoa”: Henare’s tangi was the
greatest since Timi Kara died at Gis-
borne, and the supplies of pig, eel, shark
and kumara were unlimited ; also, there
was waipiro to satisfy an army. Every tribe
on the West Coast was represented. The
enormous crowd seemed to enter into
the spirit of the tangi—all, that is, but
Mournful Pita, who kept aloof, looking
for all the world like a stray dog which
had lost a bone. On the tenth day
several tried to rouse Pita from his leth-
argy, and he unburdened his heart at
last: “Poor Henare! He dead and
never come back. Henare, he te ferra
enjoy te tangi. Now he have te great

“Well, she don’t. She lives inside.”
pig tangi and not here to enjoy himself.
Py korry, I tink it te werry pad stroke
of good ruck for Henare!”

“Gam”: Although there are plenty
of trees for nesting purposes at Kon-
gorong (S.A.) the starlings have this year
been building in rabbit burrows.
“Sa Tiko”: White-pfeller retains
clear sight up to 40 ; Binghi’s eyes start
to fade at about 30. His long-sight is
good for many years after that age ; it
is at close range that small objects be-
come dim.

“1.L.L.” (Lindenhafen, New Guinea):
This isn’t just a yarn ; it happened. Six
months ago the only
white woman here
went fishing with
native servants about
a mile from the
shore. Fish were
taking the bait well
—and the hooks,
too. At last the
only remaining hook
was wired on in a
peculiar way by one
of the servants.
This worked all
right until both wire
and hook were
taken. A few days
ago, and only a few
miles away, our
dynamite boys got
their average daily
haul. Out of the
catch of over 300
fish one was sent to
the aforementioned
fisherwoman. The
boy who wired the
last hook came
across it and the wire inside. The fish
had the whole Pacific to swim in and
might have been given to any of the 160
participants in the catch.
# * * *
“Oran”: On a hill near Goulburn
(N.S.W.) after the heavy rains we came
upon a mud-caked shape on the edge of
a washout. The shape suggested some-
thing that had once been in the lizard
line. We scraped away the caked outer
covering and produced a frilled'lizard.
With his mouth clear the frilly suddenly
opened his jaws and tried to raise his
still mud-filled frill. We put him aside
to recover, and an hour later met him,
now able to see, ambling round in excel-
lent form.
* •* * *
“Ex-C.G.: “Hotham” will have to go
a long way back for derivations of “dink”
and “pug” (B. 5/9/’34). I was a school-
boy in Warracknabeal (Vic.) when King
Edward died, and on the strength of the
news that school was closed for
the day “Dagger” Elliott gave me a
“dink” down to the creek on his bike.
In 1915 I was riding to my first job in
Mildura when another boy asked me to
“pug” him to Fourteenth-street. Bikes
were, of course, a popular form of trans-
port until the war; then came the era
of unstable prosperity when the rubber-
tyred sulky was followed by the car and
motor-cycle ; then depression, and a re-
turn of the bike, accompanied by slang
terms which had passed out of use dur-
ing its eclipse.
* * * *
“Rindy”: At the foot of a long, steep,
tar-paved hill —the kind of hill that
“Chiller” picks for his demonstrations of
free-wheel and floating-power—came
suddenly on an overturned billycart, and
on it a cut and bleeding youngster of
eight. To my “Well, son, going to have
“Oh, Mr. P’liceman, I’ve bin run into by a tram!”
“Well, keep it dark, missus, or they’ll be chargin’ you fer the damage.”
a ride?” he viciously replied, “No, I
ain’t; I just had one.” “Oh,” I said.
“What happened?” Through the abra-
sions and his bloodstained shirt-sleeve,
held half across his face, his one good
eye looked out to help him explain.
“Well, I done the top’ arf orl right; then
the swivel-bar locked, and I done the
rest on me face.”
* * * #
“Cudgerie”: Bushmen who know
won't camp in a gidya scrub, not be-
cause of its stench, but because of snakes.
Gidya is a great timber, nevertheless,
for fencing as well as fuel. Used in an
ant-bed furnace, it produces enough heat
to smelt copper ore. The “ringed” gidya
was once famous for walking-sticks, and
was much prized by old bushmen. So
rare is it that I’ve seen hundreds of trees
chipped with an axe to find a grain that
was ringed. A chap is lucky if he strikes
one “ringed” gidya out of 500 trees.
“Salt”: We in the fo’c’sle
were also glad to read of the
kindness shown to the North
Coast albatross blown ashore
(B. 12/9/’34), for isn’t it our
belief that every albatross is
the reincarnation of some
poor seafarer’s soul? Also,
to shoot, maim or hurt an
albatross is to court bad luck,
whilst a shipboard visit by
one is an infallible forerun-
ner of disaster. One voyage,
in the middle night watch, a
glider came’* aboard, flew
straight up the alleyway, past
several open doors and
turned finally into the third-
mate’s cabin. We treated
that bird kindly, and care-
fully put him to sea again ;
but what happened? The
very next voyage, four days
out, that mate was missed
during the night and was
never seen again. That’s why
sailors are concerned about
the proper treatment of alba-
trosses. The birds don’t quite
play the. game, though. If
a sailor falls overboard the blighters
don’t hesitate to peck his eyes out.
* * * *
“Top-rail”: Have never used bracken
to camp on (B. 5/9/’34), nor gum-leaves,
nor dry grass. A tired man usually con-
tents himself with a ground-sheet and
blanket after digging himself a “hipper”
—a small cavity to accommodate his
hips. My best bush bed was of spinifex
placed spiny side downwards. You need
a good canvas swag-cover to spread over
it. There is more spring and comfort
in it than a wire mattress.
* * * *
“Tom Willie”: “Top-rail’s” suggestion
(B. 5/9/’34) for building a river tramp
presupposes that the marooned man has
all the ingredients for making the craft.
Why he didn’t add a blacksmith’s anvil
and bellows beats me. For a simpler
and more effective cargo-bottom gather
together the old sticks lying about, strap
two of the longest and thickest about
4ft. apart with cross-sticks and make a
raft. Some uprights lashed to this will
provide supports for a “dry” raft or deck-
ing made from dead wood. All may be
lashed together with stringy-bark. There
is no need to swim. With this craft, as
with any boat for crossing a flooded
river, you must start well upstream to
allow for drift; in a swift current it is
about equal to the distance to be crossed.
* # * *
“Possum Trot”: Loitering unwillingly
by the brink of the Darling (N.S.W.) on
the coldest morning of the year, I noticed
a short, plump, dark-brown bird —evi-
dently a member of the All-winter Surf
Club—overcome by the icy water and
unable to rise from his morning dip. His
frantic cries seemed desperate appeals
for help, but before I could intervene
his mate swooped down from a neigh-
boring gum and at great speed collided
with the distressed. The force of the
impact lifted him clean out of the water,
and he flapped his way to safety amid
twittered rejoicings aloft.
Henry G. Lamond: Tell “Erne” (B.
25/7/’34) that an eagle can, and does,
tackle another bird in the air. In my
book “Tooth and Talon” —recently re-
viewed in The Bulletin —I give an
authentic account of a fight witnessed be-
tween an eagle and a plain turkey in
the air. That, though, doesn’t formulate
a rule. There is no inflexible law gov-
erning lives of birds. Some little time
afterwards I saw two eagles shepherding
a plain turkey. They just would not
attack that fellow while he was on the
wing. They rose above him and worked
him down to the ground, where first one
eagle and then the other would swoop
at him. The turk., poor cuss, dodged
as best he could, and tried to hide
in the long grass. The eagles flushed him
and made him stand up to the attack.
The turk. got sick of that and rose again.
As they disappeared from sight the eagles
were above the turkey, trying to force
him down so that they might take sit-
ting shots at him, and the turkey, though
tiring, was holding on manfully in his
futile efforts to outdistance the eagles.
“Ornithos”: H. G. Lamond in “Tooth
and Talon” says: Not more than once
in a thousand times does an eagle hatch
two chicks from two eggs.” I disagree.
On Westland station (Longreach, Q.)
thrice within the last two months I’ve
seen two chicks in the one nest. But in
no case have two chicks reached maturity
together. Any Aboliar explain?
A CULINARY EXPERIMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“It must be fifty year or so,” said Daniel,
as he wiped his lips,
“Since I first took on cookin’, and I started
off on sailin’ ships;
And though I’ve dished up everything, from
salted horse to fancy scran,
I’ve ’ad no more complaints, I s’pose, than
any other flarpin’ man.
“In army cookhouse, shearin’ shed, or in- the
galley of some tub,
I’ve always ’eld that blokes should eat a decent
whack of ’olesome grub;
But spare me days! what I can’t stand’s the
finicky galoot ’oo jibs
At shovin’ adequate supplies of fodder in
between ’is ribs.
“When I was cookin’ on a station once, round
Cunnamulla way,
There was a feller just like that —’e’d ’ardly
eat a thing all day:
It seems some quack ’ad told ’im that ’is
inner works was pretty weak.
But, ’struth! they must git exercise, and if
they don’t they’re bound to squeak!
“I kept on drummin’ into ’im (the lizard)
every chance I got
That one good gorge ’d, once for all, convince
’im his ideer was rot.
Me efforts at spellbindin’ did the trick, for
’e at last agreed
To give it jist one go; and, cripes! you
oughter seen that dinkum feed!
“I s’pose we’re not all built the same” —and
Dan looked thoughtful as he spoke—
“An’ yet I swear a course of ’earty eatin’
would have fixed that bloke.
But one square meal’s not quite enough to git
a man into ’is stride;
’E couldn’t see the distance out, for after
eatin’ it ’e died !”

“Ignoramus”: Wandering through
the far north of S.A., I camped one
night with a party of drovers. The talk
turned to movies, general opinion being
that they were fairly harmless as a means
of amusing simple city-dwellers, but on
the whole feeble and uninteresting. Old
Alec woke up in the middle of the dis-
cussion. Last time he went to town, he
said, he saw a much-advertised Austra-
lian film. “They had a mob of sheep
there,” he said. “Wethers, in one part;
but when they came on again, they were
ewes. Towards the finish they showed
’em again, and blow me if they wasn’t
all hoggets that time!”
* * * *
“Mt. G.”: “Bally” (B. 15/8/’34) fails
to mention one or two other ways of
telling a bushman. He usually wears his
slouch hat at an angle to shade his eyes.
Get him to talk where there aren’t any
seats, and pretty soon he’ll be squatting
on his heels, not sitting on the ground.
Also he’s more polite to women than
the townie.
* * * *
“Poonval”: I can support “Bogaduck”
(B. 8/ 8 / ’34). • Here at Innisfail (Q.)
in the wet season kookaburras often
drop from the sky. Being
skin-drinkers and averse
to taking shelter, they
can’t cease their involun-
tary libations, eventually
becoming overloaded.
Sometimes on landing the
unfortunate birds continue
drinking, and frequent
plops announce the de-
mise of these waterlogged
freaks of nature.
"No use your putting yourself on a pedestal. Why, I’ve known you ever since
you were a tadpole.”
“Bethune”: Have heard the term
“mangrove tickets” (B. 29/8/’34) referred
to in the South Aus. gulfs, where they
are also called “mud-pilots’ tickets.” One
old mud-pilot in one of the outports was
very unpopular among ex-deep-sea men
in the trade, and I once heard him
spoken of thus, “ Him! Went to the
School of Mines for a few months,
bought a dog license and a sailor’s cap,
and calls himself a captain!” Another
skipper related, in a slow, droll voice, a
story of the same gentleman’s attempt
to start a class in navigation: “It went
all right for a few weeks. He got Billy
Jones, Alf Nelson and a few others to
join up. Then as soon as he’d learnt all
they could teach him the class dis-
banded.”
* * * *
“Campus”: Don’t wish to query the
veracity of “Cooie-Bird” (B. 5/9/’34),
as his story about the kookaburra and
the soldier-birds is probably sufficiently
well-founded to comply with the Abo-
riginality Act. What Ido want to know
is, who started calling the things “sol-
dier” birds? They are the biggest coots
on wings; for general uselessness, pimp-
and sneak-thieving they beat the band.
The world’s worst bird, I say. Anyone
know a worse?
* * * *
“Hagus”: I left Scone (N.S.W.) with
a local lad as cook to bring back a mob
of ballys from the north-west. After five
days on the trip up the cook wore the
same shirt and had a decent growth of
beard. The fats gathered, we started for
home. Nearing any town I would sug-
gest a shave and a clean shirt, but was
always met with the answer, “Oh, it
doesn’t matter in these towns ; no one
knows me here.” Passing through Mu;-
rundi I again suggested the brush-up.
“What! Shave and dress up to go into
Scone? There’s no need to. Everyone
knows me there.”
* * * *
“Bogaduck”: Here’s a warning before
someone takes “Huon” (B. 5/9/’34) at
his word and goes to a seal
rookery to pat some “gentle
and confiding” old bull on
the head. Being near one
last summer, we tried to get
a few snaps, when a young
cow spotted the party. She
drew the old bull’s attentior
to us with a nip at his flank
The patriarch raised his head
let out a savage bark, ana
came straight at us, covering
the retreat of his harem, who
went sliding into the sea.
When they were all safe he
also made for the water —but
until then he had been full
of fight. Seals are usually
harmless and likeable, but it’s
a case of “Look out!” if
you get one in a fishing net or disturb
one with his wives.
* * * *
“Pax”: “Clef’s” par. (B. 22/8/’34)
about the ballad “My Old Bullock Dray”
reminds me that its writer, William
Thatcher, came to Tasmania in 1845.
Seven years later he left the Speck for
Ballarat diggings. Landing at Geelong,
he got a ride part of the way in a bul-
lock-dray—hence the song. At Ballarat
he wrote, among other songs, “The Old
Bark Hut.” In ’6l he went chasing the
elusive ’weight on the Otago diggings.
While there he wrote “The Whole Hog or
None.” Thatcher’s songs are still to be
heard in Speck and Maoriland bush
camps.
* * * *
“O’Campbell”: These tasty echidna
dishes (B. 22/8 / ’34) have me beat. Forty
years ago I tried the prickly little devils
in every culinary guise, even to soak-
ing the flesh in milk before cooking;
but neither art nor perseverance made
echidna taste of anything but ants —•
very strong and concentrated at that.
* * * *
“Llewellyn”: Bird accidents (B.
29/8/’34)? When I was driving at night,
an owl, attracted by the headlamps,
smashed itself up against the radiator.
In daylight a lethargic dove failed to rise
from the road fast enough, but escaped
with the loss of its tail-feathers. In pad-
docks with high wire-fences, particularly
where the wire is barbed, quail are often
killed when roused and chased towards
the barrier. Many dodge safely, but the
“It’s all right, Bill — I’ve found a ledge."
few that hit the wire repay the hunter’s
trouble. Quarians caught by broken
wings on telephone-wires and emus held
by the leg in fences are other casualties
I’ve come across. Most unusual accident
was that where a galah, having entangled
a loop of binder twine around its foot,
flew off and caught the free end round
a branch, where it was left hanging.
* * * *
“J. 8.”: Here’s another piece of in-
formation for the Duke of Gloucester
from a Midland (Eng.) publication, ex-
plaining the manner of catching wild
horses. Our bushmen take 21b. of flour,
6oz. of powdered ginger and half a pint
of treacle, knead it and bake it. When
the cake is cooked the men sweat it well
under their armpits and go up to a wild
horse, holding it out to him. The wild
horse advances to meet the wild Aus-
tralian, and is caught.
* * * *
“Tullingal”: Two pals were fishing at
Nariel Creek (Vic.) when, crossing a rough
paddock, they saw a snake and promptly
killed it. Glancing down a handy hole
they spotted several other wrigglers. One
by one they poked out and killed 14
browns! Returning with a camera the
pair found still another snake in the
hole, evidently a favorite rendezvous.
All the 15 were adults.
* * * *
“U. Ralia”: “Erne” —it’s a good bet
he’s a crossword-puzzle expert —hasn't
seen the wedge-tail eagle on the coast
(B. 5/9/’34). I’ve admired plenty of
them along the shores of Hervey Bay
(Q.), where the navy visits in the spring.
In the same locality the big white-
breasted eagle and the smaller chocolate-
backed fish-hawk also are plentiful.
What I thought unusual up there was
the number of plain turkies. A little
further north is Bustard Head, a spot
selected by Captain Cook to leave his
card.
* * * *
“Struth”: Spending a week-end with
a dairy-farmer near Bonalbo (N.S.W.),
I was awakened by yells from the dairy.
Host and I went out with kerosene-
lamps and a torch. In the dairy a snake
was disappearing into the darkness, but
my friend cut the wriggler in half with
the sharp corner of a batten. The blow
also brought up the pet kitten—very
slimy but still alive. As far as I know,
it is still alive.
“O’Jones”: The traveller gets an
unexpected “cock-a-doodledoo” when
approaching uninhabited North-West
Island (Great Barrier Reef) at dawn.
Descendants of domestic stock brought
to the guano workings 50-odd years ago,
the fowls lay their eggs in the mutton-
bird burrows, and nest high in the trees
to escape interference from the wild cats
that share possession of the isle. In cap-
tivity these birds at first look suspiciously
upon wheat feed. A few years ago in-
breeding had made pot-hunting on the
island not worth the trouble; but reef
fishermen and turtle-canners unloaded a
batch of fresh stock, and now roast
chicken on the Barrier is a fitting menu
associate of turtle soup and grilled
mackerel.
* * * *
“Doug”: If there’s one thing Hori
hates more than a persistent creditor it’s
a doctor. Consider the case of a Maori
who broke a leg at the Waitangi celebra-
tions early this year. It was six months
before he was taken to the sawbones,
and it speaks well for his stamina that
he can now hobble about on crutches.
* * * *
“Bitter Bark”: The mango-tree bears
abundant and scanty crops every other
year. Last season throughout N.Q. the
crop was scanty indeed. Old-timers
pointed this out, and predicted a cyclone.
Sure enough we got it. Merely coinci-
dence, or is it a characteristic of the
mango-tree?
* * * *
“Turamu”: Think I must have been
the first to describe in The Bulletin
those fenced-off village watering-places
on the Papuan Delta rivers (B. 12/9/’34).
That would be roughly 30 years ago.
I mentioned at the time, I think, that
I had seen the same precautions taken
in parts of India where the man-eating
crocodile haunted the villages. It’s curi-
ous that, while the "western Papuans
were scared to death of crocodiles, the
Binandele of the Mamba River ignored
them. I never heard of anyone being
taken by the brutes, though the river was
full of ’em and the natives were always
in the water. After floods, when the
crocs, had pursued the shoals of fish
that used to go up the small creeks, the
Mamba native would fence off the river
mouth of the gully with stakes. The croc,
would be located lying on the bottom by
prodding with long sticks. Grabbing a
length of lawyer vine, a native would
dive down and tie it round the beast s
neck. It was then hauled up for dis-
patch and dinner.
WHEN GREY CLOUDS PASS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When I see the grey clouds passing, swiftly,
straightly to the sea,
Serried rank on rank unending, comes a
longing over me
For the tang of brine and singing of taut
cordage in the wind,
Lift of bows to white-maned combers, and a
boiling wake behind;
For the shuddering pause, and stooping down
the ocean-valley’s slope;
For the sweep and hiss of water, smell of
tar and sodden rope . . .
Oh! to take a lean-flanked schooner, and to
put out in her to sea
And to race the grey clouds eastward would
be heart’s desire for me.
Where the mollyhawks are wheeling and the
albatross glides by.
Morn to dark, on tireless pinions—lord of
boundless wave and sky;
Where the porpoise schools roll lazily, and
raiding gull and shark
Pursue the harried flying-fish, ’tis there I’d
take my barque,
Over ocean depths unfathomed, into mysteries
unguessed,
Where, hid in ocean caverns, the world’s last
. secrets rest . . .
With wind and wave about me, ’tis there that
I would be
Whene'er 1 see the grey clouds go scudding to
the sea.
And to-day grey clouds are speeding upon their
trackless flight
To find the sea, their mother, as moths to
candlelight;
The ward’s white walls grow misty like ocean
fog, and now
My cot is lifting, lifting, as a brave ship lifts
her bow . . .
And through the gathering darkness a vision
comes to me
Of grey clouds drifting, drifting—as I put
out to sea.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
DIPPING AND TRAPPING.
“Maggoty”: If ever “W.D.Mc.” (B.
28 /8 / ’34) comes to Western Queensland,
he will realise how impracticable it is to
inslal a dip in every paddock.
For a start, concrete is out of the
question. We have to go 130 miles for
river sand, find a man who knows some-
thing of concrete construction, and then
excavate to any old depth in black soil
until we find the shale for a bottom.
After this, the first wet season swells the
black soil and settles the construction.
(Our fencing-posts are raised up out of
the ground from the same cause, and
have to be periodically resunk.) An iron
dip would suffer similarly.
“W.D.Mc.” gives what he considers
the cost of an iron dip.
Well, railway freights to our siding
average 15 p.c. of invoice cost for most
goods. Road carriage accounts for £2
7s. 4d. per ton at cut rates.
The outlay for a dip in every paddock
in country running a sheep to three acres
is not pleasant to ponder over. Neither
is that of the necessary receiving yards,
with race and accommodation for hold-
ing dipped sheep. Black-soil country,
after sheep have been over it a few’ times,
becomes loose and dusty. (Hereabouts
it is described as an “ash-heap.”) Hold-
ing wet sheep in dirt yards would mean
ruin to the fleeces. The alternative is
extensive and expensive gratings—in
every paddock.
Now consider the sheep to be dipped.
We arrange our lambings generally for
February, March, April, when we can
bank on green grass for the ewes. To
dip ewes in lamb early enough to prevent
disaster we would have to operate in the
wet season, a bad time to be working
sheep of any sort. We have no need to
dip sheep six weeks off shears, as this is
our dry time, and flies are not busy. The
fly starts his capers from the wet season
onwards. (After lambing, it is too late
to dip.)
Now for flytraps. Kerosene- or
benzine-tins are as plentiful on most
places as flies on a dead beast. Anyone
can make a trap with a little gauze.
Bait is always on hand. The station-
hands’ award for a youth 18 to 21 years
in our district is £1 9s. 6d. per week,
plus about 15s. for tucker. Give a lad
an old crock to poke round the traps and
you have a cheap specialist on the job.
The ordinary station-hands can treat
blown sheep as usual. The extra man
need only be kept on for the months the
fires are virulent. Out here we vote for
traps every time.
“Sheepo”: Tell “W.D.McC.” (B.
29/8/’34) I did not say dipping for fly
trouble was an experiment. I said
“W.D.McC.” was fortunate in not hav-
ing had a strike when depending on his
expedient. I still say he is one of the
most fortunate of graziers to get the
results he claims from dipping. I do
agree with him when he says few
dipping operations are carried out
thoroughly. In fact, some methods used
are just waste of time and money.
The C.S.I.R. regards dipping in the
light of only “perhaps rendering the
sheep less favorable for strike, but a
measure not to be relied upon.” I tried
all dip mixtures, but invariably with the
coming of the flies I had to handle the
sheep again a fortnight to a month after
dipping.
“W.D.McC.”: “Crutchem,” on dipping
for fly (B. 5/9/’34), confirms my opinion
that there is something radically wrong
with his methods. I do not think sheep
can be struck within four days after
dipping if the job is properly done. In
fact, I will go further: No blowfly
could touch a sheep dipped in a powder
arsenic without committing suicide.
Next time “Crutchem” dips let him put
the watch on his sheep. I am game to
bet that they are not 20 seconds in the
bath, let alone the minute which is
needed to get proper results.
“Crutchem” admits that he has not a
“walk-in” dip. All other kinds are
obsolete and out of date.
NASAL-FLY PREVENTION.
“B-gar”: “Dead Finish” (B. 29/8/’34)
gives timely warning of the presence of
the sheep bot (/Estrus ovis ) in Queens-
land. Not one grazier in a thousand
knows the symptoms.
A recent letter from a South African
friend says: “Heavy losses have occurred
from the nasal grub. It is on the in-
crease.”
I saw the sheep bot in Queensland a
decade ago. The fly lays her eggs close
to the sheep’s nose, and, when hatched,
the grubs seek the nasal chamber, finally
working their way into the head cavities.
An odd grub or two do not appear to
make much difference, but once sheep
sneeze and snort or try to strike the face
with the feet it’s odds on that nasal
grubs are becoming a nuisance.
Stud sheep of value can be relieved
of the pests by skilled operation, but
in the hands of a novice their death is
certain.
For flock sheep treatment is hopeless
once the grubs are installed. Prevention
must be adopted, and it is not easy.
When the bots are trying to gain a
lodging place for their eggs the sheep gal-
lop madly about with their heads close to
the ground. One grazier I know, on see-
ing this manoeuvre, put it down to gid,
a complaint totally different. The sheep
bot detests oil or tar, and, where num-
bers preclude the smearing of the noses,
the following method will be found
helpful:
Place the lick used in troughs,
covering with a detachable lid in which
have been bored plenty of 2in. auger
holes. Smear the tops and edges of the
auger holes with fish oil or tar and the
sheep will automatically smear them-
selves. I have seen individual sheep
treated with nostril injections of kero-
sene, turpentine and glycerine, but it is
a long job where large numbers have
to be handled.
MORE SHED-BUILDING.
“Expert”: From “Dead Finish” and
“Murrawong” we have the opinions of
a woolclasser and a* shed-hand on shear-
ing-shed construction.
As a shearing expert I differ. My
advice to graziers about to build is:
Choose a style most suitable to pocket
and convenience, whether it be L-type,
T-type or centre-board.
Select a site to prevent the sun causing
trouble at certain times of the day.
Where possible place the shed on a
slight rise. Sheep work better up a slight
incline.
“Murrawong” (B. 29/8/’34) refers to
the distance of travel of a picker-up,
which he considers trying in a 16-stand
L-type shed. At Bimerah (C.Q.), at 1921
general shearing, in an L-type shed cov-
ered with bulrushes, 22 shearers worked
on one straight board. They shore about
70,000 wethers, which cut very respect-
able fleeces. The picker-up for the
three shearers at the far end of the
board had sufficient energy at the com-
pletion of the day’s work to be the life
and soul of our evenings.
“Dead Finish”: The suggestion for a
woolshed, before “Murrawong” (B.
29/8/’34) horned in with a centre-board,
was based on utility. The idea was to
vision a shed acceptable to a small man’s
banker. Putting up an elaborate build-
ing to suit the convenience of employees
only never entered into the scheme.
Building “fast sheds for slow rousies” is
not favored by people who foot the bill.
The shed-hands I’ve happened across
were always more concerned as to how
long the job would last and if there
was another to follow than with the
shape of the building.
Isis Downs is the show shed of
Queensland, but it is not a centre-board
in the sense that “Murrawong” uses the
word. The board, fitted with flexible
electric gear, is always described as being
horseshoe-shaped, and drapes itself
around the woolroom, eliminating all
waste space. Try putting the same num-
ber of stands of ordinary machinery on
a straight line of shafting and note how
much building is required to house it.
Anyway, Isis Downs can be left out.
Whoever heard of its owners being put
on a limit of expenditure?
Just one item should demonstrate which
is the more expensive to erect. The shed
originally described had a skillion roof
over the shearing board and catching-
pens, the highest part, over the
machinery, sloping away to the penning-
up race. A gable roof was over the
wool- and pressrooms. The board had
sufficient spaced cross-battens between
chute openings to block it in, while on
the northern side, where the penning-up
race was, spaced battens the full length
were placed. Against this, a centre-board
usually has an expensive roof, and must
be walled in all round to protect the
woolroom. This costs a lot of money
compared with the open-sided shearing
board of an L shed.
If we consider the comfort of the men
as of paramount importance, the L shed
for the hot months of the year is
superior. I have seen men clutching in
February, in sheds of the design “Mur-
rawong” loves, in that district between
Nymagee and Condobolin (N.S.W.).
Hemmed in all round, the sheds were
stifling, and it was no rare sight to
see a crutcher sprawl out on the board
with heat apoplexy. Literally, the men
were in the habit of going out into the
sun to get cool. In the other type of
shed, with the board open to every
breeze, shearers are never inconvenienced
to this degree. In the winter time, of
course, it is cold, but our sheds
for service and the length of our pockets.
The C.W.A. runs the “rest” rooms.
(Continued on page 24.)
THE SCOURING OF WOOL.
“Dead Finish”: “Jumbuck” (B.
22/8/’34) mentions lack of competition
as a factor which helps to preclude
growers from scouring dusty low-grade
wools. There is no doubt about this,
but he recommends sending half the
dusty lots to market in the grease and
scouring the balance. He implies that
the result will be in favor of scouring.
The demand for scoureds‘must be con-
sidered.
A few years ago I halved a line as
“Jumbuck” suggests, and the result was
in favor of the grease. Still, year in
and year out, with a reasonable demand
for scoureds, it pays to treat dusty and
low-grade sorts. Scouring may induce
a buyer to inspect an offering unattrac-
tive in the grease.
TREATING SHEEPSKINS.
“Valerin”: Best three-quarter and full-
wool sheepskins are realising from 7ld.
to Bd. per pound at Sydney auctions —
about 30 per cent, less than average
fleece wool. Ordinary station-dried skins
will show a wider divergence of values.
It seems to me that sheepskins could
be dewoolled more scientifically than by
fellmongering, which destroys the
“handle” and elasticity of greasy lines.
A few stations shear their skins, and
it should not be impossible to design a
shear which would remove practically
all the wool from a pelt. This would
mean quicker and cheaper handling ; the
fleece would come off practically whole,
rendering it easier to sort than clips,
which are generally broken into small
pieces. The raw material could be used
for ordinary top-making, and thus would
be worth 2d. per pound more than
clipped wool of -the same description.
I think shorn pelts could be tanned
without being fellmongered, and that
this would mean improvement in the
quality of the leather.
I admit that anything under half-
woolled skins might not be satisfactorily
handled, but even that is worth while in
these hard times.
PICKING THE PROFIT-EARNERS.
“Bahb Dwyer”: A word of caution is
needed about “H.D.B.’s” exposition of
the score-card points of the dairy cow.
If a cow conforms to the require-
ments of the score-card, she should be a
good producer, but there are many ex-
ceptidns. An English investigator, after
exhaustive comparisons of show-ring
with production records, concluded that
judging a cow’s production by appear-
ance alone was only 20 per cent, efficient,
whilst judging on family production
records was 80 per cent, efficient. Put
another way, the chances against your
picking a good producer on appearance
are 4 to 1 ; but if you have access to
properly kept records the odds are 4
to 1 in your favor that you can name
the untried heifer as a profit-earner or
otherwise.
By all means let the dairy-farmer
learn the type points, but first let him
learn most thoroughly that there is one
way of ascertaining for certain whether
Strawberry is a worker or a drone, and
that way is by continuous and thorough
testing of the whole herd. The Babcock
tester is the one certain indicator. The
man who has tested can bear witness to
the way it shatters many of our fond
illusions about size of milk-veins, color
inside ear, size and shape of horns,
escutcheon, etc.
Also, the heavy milker isn’t necessarily
the heavy butter-fat yielder.
IS SILAGE EXPENSIVE?
“St. Andrews”: Nobody makes me as
sore as people like “X.T.” (B. 5/9/’34)
who advocate “ensilage” as being cheap.
It is the dearest form of fodder. I made
“silage” more than 40 years ago under


lip!

A
BACKACHE-
Stop awful pain this easy way
Pain —awful pain—constant pain—
nerve-irritating: pain all day, and all
night, too. Yes, the martyr to chronic
backache soon begins to know what the
word “ pain ” means.
Why do you let Backache, Lumbago,
Joint Pains, Rheumatism, Sciatica, ruin
your health and make you a misery to
yourself and all around you.
Many people say “ Oh! I must have caught cold,” or “ I
must have been sitting in a draught. My back feels like
breaking.. . That dull, down-dragging weakness in the
back makes me feel exhausted... Pains in the muscles —
I just can’t get on with my work.”
RELIEF IH 24 HOURS
No more “too-old,” worn-out feeling. You join with the youngest
in all the pleasures of life. In 24 hours you will see the action of
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills, and know how quickly they have
reached the seat of your trouble —the kidneys. Why stop in pain and
weakness, when here is health for the asking? Let this safe, sure
remedy bring you health now. Refuse all substitutes—there is nothing
just as good as De Witt’s Pills. Sold only in the blue, white and gold
boxes, price 3/6, or the larger, more economical size, 6/6. In your
own interest you should see that the name of the manufacturers,
E. C. De Witt & Co. (Aust.) Pty. Ltd., is clearly printed on the box.
WEAK KIDNEYS CAUSE UNTOLD AGONIES
This splendid remedy, through the kid-
neys, expels the poisons such as uric acid
in excess and other impurities that are the
cause of your suffering. These are not
“cure-all” pills. They are prepared to
tone up the kidneys and give you back
your strength and vigour.
Actually it is kidney weakness that is the
cause of the down-dragging weariness and
constant pain you suffer. If weak kidneys
are sapping your strength, causing body
pains, rheumatic twinges, bladder trouble,
you cannot possibly do better than start at
once with De Witt’s Pills.

the advice of Government experts, and
when I think of all the labor and money
I spent I get hot and bothered.
With deference to “X.T.’s” authority,
Mr. A. Brunskill, jun., I neighbored his
father near Wagga more than 45 years
ago, but he never made silage till he
was a comparatively wealthy man.
To say that silage can be made for
three or four shillings per ton is fallacy
—it would scarcely pay for the men’s
tucker on the job. When silage is made
you will find that one ton of prime
oaten hay is equal in feed value to three
tons of it.
Lucerne and oaten hay, properly saved
and baled, will keep for years if placed
in mouseproof stacks. To get silage out
of a pit is the most laborious work on
a farm.
’HOPPER BRIGADES.
“The 0.D.”: New South Wales has
developed a technique against grass-
hoppers (B. 12/9/’34). It is the inven-
tion of Harold Bartlett, H.D.A., who, as
agricultural instructor at Parkes last
year, studied the swarming pests. He
assesses the ’hopper losses to N.S.W. in
1933 at upwards of £3,500,000, and be-
lieves he can keep the State clear at a
cost of not more than £3 per holding in
affected districts.
He plumps for brigades on the same
lines as bushfire brigades.
Depots would be established with sup-
plies of bran, molasses and arsenite of
soda. Amendments to the P.P. Act
would declare the grasshopper noxious,
and make notification and destruction
compulsory.
When a landholder notified the pres-
ence of the just-hatched swarms, the
brigade would draw the necessary sup-
plies from the depot, mix a bait and
have it distributed before and among
the advancing swarm in the form of a
thinly-scattered bran mash. W. B.
Gurney, Chief Entomologist, swears that
the mixture won’t hurt stock or birds,
and that what ’hoppers it misses won’t
matter.
The plan has yet to be tested, but 43
P.P. boards have accepted it, the Gov-
ernment to provide 50 per cent, of the
funds, and the boards to be responsible
for the repayment of Government
advances.
WILD TURNIP IN W.A.
“A.G.T.”: Official recognition of this
weed in Westralia took place in 1916,
but the writer came in contact with it
in an oat crop in 1911. As the oat seed
came from a farm in another district it
is evident it was here in 1910.
Since then it has spread rapidly over a
great part of the agricultural lands.
While not materially affecting crop
growth I have found that it impedes
harvesting. When dry it breaks off at
ground level when touched by the
harvester comb, and, carried along,
brushes the wheat aside.
Eradication is difficult. When paddocks
are put in grass for two seasons, turnip
only shows itself as a diminutive plant,
mostly bearing one seed pod. When
paddocks are left out for five years the
plant disappears —but not for long.
Cultivation at once revives it.
I have found that the best way to deal
with turnip is by the ordinary clean-
fallow method. Sow an early-maturing
wheat that grows to a fair height. Wheats
that are likely to go down or get tangled
should be avdided. Sow reasonably early
so as not to let the turnip get a start.
Harvest the crop as soon as ripe. If
there are green turnips in it and they
choke a bit in the machine, keep going.
If the machine pulls out and waits for
them to dry they are much worse to
handle.
A WORD FOR THE CROWS.
“Valerin”: Several P.P. Boards are
agitating for a bonus on crows’ heads.
As a member of a board, I have always
opposed it.
The crow is the best scavenger we
have, and does good work in keeping
down the blowfly trouble. He cleans
up ’hoppers, caterpillars and other pests.
At lambing and in a drought the crow
is a nuisance, but can be kept in hand.
The crow’s cleverness is exaggerated.
He is merely cunning. Note how he
falls into a trap which other birds treat
with contempt. Although he keeps well
out of gunshot range, a rifle puts the
wind up him properly.
IN FOUL AIR.
“Respirator”: To a man working in
a well the first indication of bad air is
a prickling sensation of the skin. Next
is a refusal of the body to sweat. If he
doesn’t come up lively he quickly falls
into a don’t-care-a-cuss condition which
prompts him to lie down.
Usually foul air has no color, smell
or taste.
An infallible indication is the match.
If a match burns brightly, things are
right. If it burns dim and yellow, feebly
and splutteringly, ring for the windlass.
It is quite useless for the man on top
to go down to effect a rescue when a
sinker collapses.
Pour a bucket of water —or a pint if
there isn’t a bucket—down the well. It
will spray and fill the shaft. That breaks
the bad air and, in falling, the drops
carry oxygen to the fellow below. Fail-
ing water, use any old liquid. I have
known a pint save a man 40 feet below.
Plenty more can do no harm and whips
of good.
Bad air is easily cleared. I have done
it by wetting a saddle-cloth and lower-
ing and raising that a dozen or more
times; and by sending a bucket up and
down, filling it with water at the bottom
and tipping it all back when it got to
the surface.
For all practical purposes, any well
which has movement in it is safe —a
pump shaft working up and down, a
bucket lifting or anything to keep the air
circulating.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“H.D.8.”: Try this for poddy calves.
Boil pumpkins to a jelly and feed with
separated milk and a little limewater.
It’s a great rearing mixture.
“Hagus”: With the first green feed
in spring in some districts calves with
patches of white hair are troubled with
blue aphis. Use half a pound of lard to
half a cup of kerosene, mixing well
together. After one good rubbing the
aphis drop off.
“Bill R.”: Horse or bullock rogues
sometimes learn to remove sliprails. To
euchre them swing a cleat over the mov-
able end of a rail with a screw driven
into the headpost. The rail will catch
the cleat and will not lift, but the cleat
can easily be pushed aside by a stock-
man.
“Jindivick”: For grass paddocks
infested with “take-all” grubs the best
treatment is as follows: Tear the sur-
face thoroughly with well-sharpened
cultivation harrows and apply a heavy
dressing of lime. Harrow thoroughly
again to work the dressing into the soil.
Any particularly bad patches should be
resown.
“Rix”: If two mobs of ewes with
young lambs get boxed draft the ewes
through the race, letting the lambs run as
they like. Then put one mob on one side
of a wire fence, with the bottom wire
cut or slack, and hold the other mob on
the other side of the same fence. In a
short time the lambs will have mothered
themselves. If put into two small pad-
pocks divided by a fairly-slack fence and
left to themselves all night every lamb
will by morning have drafted itself into
the right mob without trouble or
knocking about. With any but very
small flocks it is hopeless to attempt to
mother the lambs by hand.
“The Breaker”: Never give a horse
with strangles a drench. Isolate —the
complaint is contagious. Plaster the
swollen glands with a mustard paste, and,
when the abscess comes to a head, open
with a well-sterilised instrument. Syringe
daily with weak lysol until healed.
Don’t turn the prad out bush until cer-
tain the disease has vanished.
“O’Campbell”: Don’t get a coursing
dog for your rabbit pack. The blood
is right if you get a pup, but a kangaroo
dog or greyhound used to coursing never
learns to wheel a rabbit the way the
fast mong or kangaroo pup does.
“A.G.T.”: To compare the diameter
of rods clamp one lightly in the vyce.
Then use the vyce jaws as a gauge for
the others.
“Rix”: Penned for shearing, daggy
sheep stain the wool of others they
rub against, depreciating its value. They
also make the board dirty while being
shorn, with the result that the rump
wool of every subsequent sheep brought
to shear is stained. To cut the dags off
even the dirtiest sheep is some trouble,
but it is work which pays a big dividend.

WHERE SHE LIVES.
“She is one of those who actually live in
the surf.” — “Sun.”
I have met her. She was enjoying her
lunch in her beautiful home in the third
breaker when, with a friend, I went out
and was introduced. We immediately
dived into a most interesting conversa-
tion. She told me she very seldom went
to bed beyond the first breaker. Look-
ing back as we left, we saw her reclin-
ing on her surfoplane reading “Passion-
ate Hearts.”
In accordance with her invitation, we
had afternoon-tea with her next day.
She had installed a nice undertow in her
drawing-room, by means of which
several of her guests departed—seaward.
The party was quite a lively one, in
which a game of “dumpers” caused con-
siderable amusement; but it became too
lively altogether after the arrival of a
party of bluebottles and a shark.
The lady probably feels comfortable
enough sleeping in the bed of the sea,
but until they instal a first-class hotel, all
conveniences—especially saloon bar —
this business of living in the surf would
not exactly please me.

ACTION PIECE.
I rang the bell.
The little Japan-
ese heeded it not.
In small, short
jabs his right arm shot out to land first
on the neck and then on the shoulders.
Deftly he swung, and the blow landed
on the chest. Again and again his arm
shot out. Fairly on the button this time!
Of course, it smashed in a dozen pieces.
Again I rang the bell, louder this time,
and with a grunt of satisfaction the little
man put down his iron, hung up the
shirt and shuffled across to the counter.

CONSTANT TRIER OFFERS TO
RETURN GOOD FOR ILL.
If ever The Bulletin should decide
(with suitable apologies to its readers)
to print the worst jokes it has ever re-
ceived, then it is a certainty that my
initials would be seen at the foot of them.
I always sign my jokes with initials
only, and if you could see them (the
jokes, not the initials) you would agree
that it was a very reasonable precaution.
Although my name adorns not the
pages of literature, I am well known to
the editor. He reads my contributions—
and suffers a sleepless night. My hand-
writing is so bad that he used to think
each contribution was from a different
person, until he realised that another like
me was impossible. He once sat down
fully determined to make something out
of one of my jokes. He’s never been the
same man since. I have put his one foot
in the grave and the other so close to it
that when he hears there is going to be
an increase in taxation he merely laughs.
But I would like to do him one good
turn before it is too late, so if he has
a grudge against any contributor (except
me) will he please forward the said con-
tributor's address, and I will send him
by the first mail one of my jokes. He
will never contribute again. And now,
following my invariable practice, I sign
myself

HARD OF HEARING.
Five times I shouted “Cumanaveadrink !”
And motioned to the old bloke
standing near me ;
Five times l voiced the phrase, but do
you think
The ancient cove showed signs that he
could hear me ?
No, not until I’d literally bawled
Another invitation in his lug
Did he catch on. Then, with a grin, he
drawled,
“I’m sorry, mate —me old ears play
me tricks,
But thank yuh” (pushing forth his
empty mug),
“If you don’t mind, me boy, I’ll sink

P. O. M. C.
PEEPS AT THE PROFESSIONS.
V. —The Singer.
The tenor and the baritone
Are relics of a bygone age; '
The radio and gramophone
Have almost forced them from the
stage.
And yet, serene and undismayed,
They still attempt to ply their trade,
And make the joyous welkin ring
In choirs and places where they sing.
Singers are usually either male or
female, although in the case of radio
singers their sex is often indeterminate.
In non-technical terms the males may
be classified as gruff, not so gruff, and
not gruff; the females as squawkers,
squeakers, squealers and screechers.
When conversing with them it is safer
to stick to technical terms. Some people
classify singers according to their habits.
This is fairly safe. Baritones usually
sleep in the deep, follow the road or are
found in cellar cool D-r-i-n-k-i-n-g.
Tenors spend their time saying good-bye
to summer, giving away sparkling eyes
(in pairs) and exhorting people to come
to the fair.
At one time both types were more or
less addicted to love-songs, but nowa-
days they leave this field to the crooner.
A crooner is a tone-deaf semi-mute who
sings between the notes and has the
ability to put the whole of his unctuous,
greasy soul into his eyes.
There is only one thing worse than
watching or listening to a crooner, and
that is watching and listening to him.
Among female singers the distinction
is fairly simple. Sopranos invite their
audience to hear the gentle lark, but
make so much noise that it is practically
impossible for the audience to do so.
Contraltos believe more in the personal
touch, entreating you to aboide with
them, in which case they undertake to
give you the keys of heaven. It is just
as well to decline the offer.
Contraltos have also an odd taste for
remaining out on the rocks when the
toide is low.
It is sometimes thought that all singers
are stout. This is quite erroneous, as a
glance at any street singer will show.
Singing schools do a lot of harm in
trying to teach people to sing. It has
long been established that you can’t
teach people to sing, and the money
would be much better spent if it were
used to persuade would-be singers not
to sing. Not that there is anything
wrong with singing in its proper place,
but the proper place for a considerable
proportion of our singers is in the studio
of a disconnected wireless station.
Many people think the time has come
when a firm stand should be taken on
this point. They claim that singers are
no longer necessary. There are already
sufficient gramophone records to supply
the world’s musical requirements, and
the need for the vox Humana has dis-
appeared. As for
new songs, if it
is really neces-
sary to have new
songs, let them
be written direct
on to the records.
Singers, how-
ever, oppose this,
claiming that the
only way to get
songs is from
singers. They
quote the poet
who wrote
“Though we may
beget the singer
we cannot beget
the song.”
However, time
will tell.
JASBY.
FIDELITY.
True love has fired my soul at last!
Coquettes may try with looks divine
To make me weak as in the past,
But they shall fail: true love is mine !
Yes! Filled with love as ne’er before,
Whate’er I do, where’er I go,
I will be faithful evermore —
To Elsie, Alice, .lean and Flo!

Information Sought
Did Jack Dempsey and Georges Carpentier
at Jersey City on July 2, 1921, draw a bigger
“gate” than Dempsey v. Luis Firpo in New
York on September 14, 1923 ? How much
money did these contests draw, and did the
Dempsey-Gene Tunney tilt in Chicago on Sep-
tember 22, 1927, attract as big a “gate” as
the other two put together ? —3467.
Official receipts: Dempsey v. Carpentier,
1,789,238 dollars (about £357,847); Dempsey
v. Firpo, 1,188,603 dollars (about £237,721);
Dempsey v. Tunney, 2,658,660 dollars (about
£531,732).
(1) Size of the Nell Gwynne hat worn by
Nellie Stewart ? (2) Names of players who
had the leading male and female roles, in “La
Poupee” when first produced in Sydney ? (3)
When J. C. Williamson transfers a production
from one State to another do the members
of ballet, chorus and orchestra go with the
show, or are new combinations secured in
different States ? —2900.
(1) A photograph shows it to be about 3jft-
wide, and the surrounding feathers make it
up to about sft. (2) Dorothy Vane (Doll),
George Lauri (Hilarius), Pat Bathurst (Father
Maxime) and Charles Kenningham (Lancelot).
(3) Principals, chorus and ballet are transferred
from one State to another, but the orchestral
players are generally permanent employees
of the theatre and remain in the home State.
My electioneering addresses have given me
“clergyman’s sore throat.” Treatment ? —3559.
This is merely the popular name for - laryn-
gitis or inflammation of the larynx (voice-box).
There are two kinds, with opposite kinds of
treatment. For the laryngitis that troubles
people who only occasionally overwork the
voice the remedy is to strengthen all the vocal
muscles and membranes by speaking every day
(by graduated exercise) in a loud unaffected
voice. A few lessons from a good teacher of
elocution may be necessary. If then there are
recurrences of loss of voice, see a doctor. For
the laryngitis that bothers school-teachers and
others who continually overwork the vocal
apparatus rest is the best remedy.-
What is the surest way of reducing weight ?
—3298.
If the excess weight is due to age or organic
changes, take medical advice. Avoid liquids
with meals, curtail fats, sugar and starchy
foods, and take an aperient saline each morn-
ing. Apples, oranges and all fresh fruits ex-
cept bananas and grapes are permissible. White
bread, potatoes, butter, fresh milk and cocoa
should be shunned. Exercise benefits in all
cases, but avoid extremes.
(1) Is a husband liable for ALL debts con-
tracted by his wife ? (2) Will a public notice
in newspapers disclaiming any responsibility
free him from liability? —349l.
(1) Not for all debts. Where husband and
wife are living together the husband is liable
for necessaries supplied to his wife unless she
receives an allowance for such necessaries.
What are necessaries depends upon the circum-
stances of the parties. In every case the ques-
tion of liability rests largely on whether the
husband’s conduct is such as would justify other
persons in believing that his wife acts with his
authority. The broad rule is that, except where
the wife acts as the agent of her husband, or
the person with whom she contracts has reason-
able grounds for believing that she does so, the
husband is not liable for her contracts. (2)
This may be of assistance, but is not of itself
a full release.
Pawned a gold article with a Sydney pawn-
broker four years ago and have paid no
interest. Can 1 compel the pawnbroker to
show me what the article was sold for, and
when; and, if it brought more than was owing,
can I claim the balance ? —3437.
A pawnbroker is bound to permit the
pawner to inspect the entry of sale, which he
is required to make. If the article was sold
for more than the full amount of principal
and interest due, he must pay over the. surplus
to the pawner—but only if claimed within 12
months from date of sale.
(1) Where and how to obtain a special mar-
riage license in N.S.W. ? (2) Usual fee ex-
pected by a clergyman for conducting a
marriage service ? —3330.
(1) There is no provision for the issue of
marriage licenses in N.S.W. Arrangements
for a marriage should be made direct with
a minister. (2) A matter between the parties and
the celebrant. If the marriage is performed by
a District Registrar, a fee of £1 ss. is payable.
How do 1 stand as regards rates and taxes,
also interest, due by me on a block of land in
N. S. Wales, partly paid for ? I have paid no
instalments for three years. —3438.
The council can sue you for the rates. Pay-
ment of interest is a matter between you and
the vendor.
(1) I have composed some dance music.
Where should I send it for publication ? (2)
How many firms in Australia publish music ?
(3) Is it necessary to copyright compositions
before submitting them to the publishers ? (4)
How is copyright secured and cost ? (5) What
price is paid by publishers for a popular com-
position ? —3372.
(1) and (2) Allan, Chappell, Paling, Davis,
Albert and Nicholson, all with offices in
Sydney, are the chief Australian publishers.
(3) No. (4) Apply to Registrar of Copyrights,
Canberra. A ss. fee covers the British Empire,
Continental Europe and Japan. Separate appli-
cation to the Registrar of Copyrights in U.S.A.
is necessary for U.S.A. copyright; fee, two
dollars ( plus exchange). (5) Usual terms are
10 p.c. royalty on sheet sales and 50 p.c. of
fees from performing rights, sound films and
records, varied according to circumstances.
(1) Particulars of adobe bricks as used for
building houses ? (2) Any books on the subject ?
—3497.
(1) “Adobe” is a Spanish-American name
applied to sun-dried bricks made from any suit-
able material, such as clay mixed with straw,
which has become hardened on exposure to the
sun. Such bricks, employed largely in the arid
and semi-arid districts of North America, are
usually made in two sizes, 18in. x 9in. x 4in.
and 16in. x 12in. x 4in., the latter size being
used with the greatest dimension crosswise to
the length of the wall. The process of baking
consists of first exposing the newly moulded
adobes to the direct rays of the sun for a day
and then turning them for exposure of the
underside and continuing the exposure for from
seven to 14 days, eventually stacking under
cover until required for use. Because of lack
of coherence, adobes can only be used in
regions of limited rainfall. (2) Do not know
of any. Try books on brickmaking.
Recipe for mead ? —3536.
Place honey in 1 gallon of water and
boil for 1 hour. Skim well while boiling, strain
the skimmings, and return the strained liquor
to the pan before boiling ceases. Take off the
fire and set aside to cool. Before it is quite
cold stir in yeast at the rate of 1 cup yeast
to every 9 gallons liquid. Put the mead into a
cask and store in a cool place for one year,
then bottle.
(1) What is the significance of the termina-
tion “agh” in Irish names, such as Shelagh,
Murtagh and Armagh ? (2) The meaning of the
termination “een,” as in Roseen and Maureen ?
—3248.
(1) The termination is not Irish, but the
English attempt at the pronunciation of a gut-
tural ending. Shelagh is “sighle” in Irish—
equivalent to Shiela or Celia. Murtagh is
“Muirteartach,” pronounced “Murta,” col-
loquially Morty. Armagh is “Ard-macha,”
the hill of Macha. (2) It is a diminutive.
Roseen means little Rose or Rosie, and
Maureen little Mary.
What Australian histories record the leaving
behind of a sealer on Baudin’s Rocks, Bruchen
Bay, in the thirties of last century? —3lB6.
In “Letters from Victorian Pioneers” there
is one from Captain Hart relating the incident,
which he dates as happening on December 16,
1831. There is a reference also in the “Pro-
ceedings of the Royal Geographical Society,
South Australian Branch,” Vol. 25, 1925, under
the heading “Early Settlers in South Australia.”
(1) Where can I get a preparation for re-
blueing rifle-barrels ? (2) Where can I get .22
Savage Hi-Power shells reloaded, and cost ?
3390.
(1) None on the market. (2) Know of no
firm that would undertake the work. Your
best plan would be to purchase a reloading
outfit complete, which would cost you approxi-
mately 525. 6d., plus postage. Bullet-moulds
would cost approximately 355.
Particulars of the first production of Eugene
O’Neill’s plays in Australia ? —3523.
The first production was that of “The Hairy
Ape,” given at St. James’s Hall, Sydney,
12/11 /’23, by Duncan Macdougall. This pro-
ducer also presented, at his Playbox Theatre,
“Emperor Jones,” in November, 1926 ;
“Strange .Interlude,” 27/11 /’29 ; and “Desire
Under the Elms,” 8/2/’3O. Productions of
“Anna Christie” have also been given by (first)
Adelaide Repertory Theatre co.; (second) Gre-
gan McMahon, in both Sydney and Melbourne;
and (third) Scott Alexander, at his repertory
theatre, Sydney.
Recipe for a lime whitewash ? —2730.
Take 1 kerosene-tin of live lime and slake
with water, keeping a bag over the top to
retain the steam. Strain the liquid, when quiet,
through a fine sieve, and add 141 b. salt, first
dissolved in just sufficient hot water to make
the mixture liquid; then add 31b. ground rice
boiled to a thin paste in water and stirred m
boiling, £lb. powdered whiting and ilb. glue
melted over a slow lire. Add 5 gallons hot
water to the mixture, stir well, cover and
leave for two days. Before using heat it
again, and paint it on the walls hot.
(1) Is a fernlike plant, growing to three or
four feet high, commonly called “carrot fern
and alleged to be hemlock, really hemlock ?
(2) Is it poisonous, and is it dangerous to
handle or to use for interior decoration ? (3)
Is it poisonous to stock ? (4) Has it been de-
clared a noxious weed ? (5) If so, is it an
offence to grow it in a private garden in town ?
—3402.
Hemlock is very poisonous, both to man and
stock. It is sometimes grown for decorative
work, and there is no danger in actually
handling it. Stock are poisoned by it, although
they usually avoid eating it. It is proclaimed
noxious in a number of shires and municipali-
ties, and where so proclaimed it is an offence
to cultivate it in a private garden. Can’t
say whether the weed you refer to is hemlock
or not. Send a specimen to the Botanist,
Botanic Gardens, Sydney.
(1) What are the plants known as “ever-
lastings” ? (2) How are they grown ? —3593.
(1) The true everlasting flowers are helichry-
sum, statice and rhodanthe. (2) Sow seed in
October in sheltered boxes or pans and plant
seedlings in November. The best garden effect
is produced by planting them 12m. apart in
clumps of eight and keeping them staked. Cut
me uower-stalks when nearly full-bloom, and
hang the flowers head down to dry, after which
they will last for v months for indoor decoration.
How to propagate fuchsias, and best position
to grow them ? —3580.
Set slips taken from last year’s wood in boxes
of sandy loam and cover them with glass until
rooted (which takes about four weeks); then
plant out 3ft. apart. Fuchsias require well-
drained soil and a semi-shady position. Prune
them in August and give plenty of rotted
manure. In frosty districts cultivation in pots
or boxes is advised. The plants can then be
used for indoor decoration.
Best way to handle lachenalia bulbs which
have just finished flowering ? I need the plots
for other w0rk. —3572.
Like all garden bulbs, lachenalias must be
left where they have flowered until the blooms
fade and the leaves perish. To- shift them be-
fore then is to risk loss of the parent bulbs
through shrivelling, and most of the young
cormlets will perish. Do not grow bulbs where
they cannot be left undisturbed.
Best soil for pot-plants ? —3612.
Mix together equal parts of light and heavy
loam (virgin soil) and bake it on an iron sheet
or pan to kill disease and vermin. Then mix
into it one-quarter part of dry rotted and pul-
verised cow manure, excluding worms and
insects. Turn the soil half a dozen times to

for immediate requirements, since potting soil
deteriorates quickly.

What was the first regular theatre in Eng-
land ? There seems to be some vagueness on
the part of historians with regard to “The
Curtain” and “The Theatre.” Whereabouts
in London were they located ? —3542.
The first public theatre in London was
situated in the parish of Shoreditch about
half a mile north of where the Bank of Eng-
land now stands. Until quite recently the site
of the theatre was identified with a plot of
ground formerly occupied by Deane’s Mews;
the County Council has issued a pamphlet on
the subject, the work of W. W. Braines, who
has succeeded in locating the exact spot. “From
the High-street turn into New Inn Yard, and at
a distance of 120 yards is the site of ‘The
Theatre,’ about 50ft. north of this street and
within a few feet of the east side of Curtain-
road.” The Curtain Theatre was built during
the same year as “The Theatre,” in another
part of the same field, and was sometimes
used by the Burbadge and other players (in-
cluding Shakspeare) as an auxiliary theatre.
The site of “The Curtain” was on what is now
Hewitt-street (formerly Curtain Court), off
Curtain-road.
Can you give a handy summary of world
chronology ? The scientific books confuse me.
I want a bird’s-eye view that I can retain in
the memory. —3so6.
Total age of the earth, as far as it can be
traced back in records, is supposed to be
1,000,000,000 years, divided into five eras —
the Azoic (without animal or plant life),
Eozoic (dawn of life) and Paleozoic (ancient or
fossil life), each of about 300,000,000 years;
the Mesozoic (mid-life, or era of reptiles), about
150,000,000 years; and the Cenozoic (common
life, or mammal era of to-day), which is sup-
posed to have endured 50,000,000 years. The
records of human history do not extend back
further than 5000 years out of the 500,000
years men have lived on earth.
Particulars of the s.s. Egypt, and how and
where was she wrecked ? —3275.
She was a ship of 8000 tons, built at
Greenock on the Clyde in 1897 for the P.
and O. Co., and was engaged in the Indian
service at the time of the wreck. She left
Tilbury docks for her last voyage on Friday,
May 19, 1922, carrying 44 passengers and a
crew of 291, including officers. The cargo
included about 10 tons of silver and five
tons of gold, total value £1,054,000. On the
20th, in a heavy fog, she was struck by a large
French cargo steamer, the Seine, and sank
within 20 minutes in 400 ft. of water, 30 miles
off the coast of Britanny, with a loss of 96
lives. The first successful salvage was car-
ried out by the Artiglio in June, 1932, the bulk
of the treasure going to the underwriters, who
paid on a total loss when the Egypt sank.
Is it likely that if Haydn had visited Italy,
as he once contemplated, he would have written
an opera of great importance ? —2778.
Carl Ferdinand Pohl, Haydn’s most-esteemed
German biographer, thought that if Haydn had
visited Italy, and had his faculties stimulated
by fresh scenes and a larger horizon, some fine
operas might have resulted. J. Cuthbert Had-
den, an English biographer, contests this view.
According to him, Haydn “lacked the true
dramatic instinct. His placid, easy-going, con-
tented nature could never have allowed him to
rise to great heights of dramatic force.”
Brief Answers.
J.M.D.: (1) No; except as to mines and on
vessels. (2) and (3) Inquire of Technical
College. Sydney. (4) Most oil-fed boilers are
automatically controlled. (5) The particulars
given are not sufficient. It is necessary to
know whether the boiler is used in connec-
tion with machinery, and, if so, the nature and
situation of such machinery... .R.C.: There
is no truth in the statement. Racial charac-
teristics are present, but the framework of
bone and cartilage is common to all. Contour
of the nose is maintained by plates of car-
tilage loosely connected to each other, and
junction is made at the central septal cartilage.
The latter can be felt above the cartilaginous
division at the nose tip... .J.A.F.: The ginger-
beer “plant” is a yeast or ferment in fungus
form used to brew the beverage of this name.
It is not harmful provided that it is kept clean
and prepared freshly from day to day. A
high alcoholic percentage must be avoided....

FORESTRY AND THE UNEMPLOYED.
“Hauler”: The Bulletin has taken
up the cudgels for the timberman. Of
course, it’s only what we should expect
from the paper that shares our camp-
fires and shared the dad’s before us.
Our troubles differ from dad’s. He
had plenty of bush and worried only
about getting the logs out as quickly as
possible. We haven’t the logs to get out.
There’s scarcely a mill on the South
Coast (N.S.W.) cutting to full capacity,
and the trouble is lack of logs, not lack
of markets. Dad strolled beside his
team for the few chains between bush
and mill; we run tractors for miles to
pick up the few trees the old boy re-
jected. Aren’t we glad he was fastidious,
too!
For some years an independent com-
mission saw that all timbermen made the
best of a bad job on an even footing.
Now the Government is trying to do
with forestry what opponents want to do
with the banks. Political control can
only lead to favoritism, and no one will
know where he stands. Cut out the tech-
nical man, and all the wanglers in N. S.
Wales will scrap for the job.
Let the politician keep Sydney, but
leave the bush clean for the timberman,
the campfire and The Bulletin.
“Regnans”: Your efforts to prevent
forestry falling under political control
are appreciated by those interested in
timber. There are two reasons why
foresters have remained undemonstra-
tive. First, the few trained men we pos-
sess have tried to “catch up to the fallers”
in the job of putting the exploited
bush in order. Had they paid less atten-
tion to the bush and more to making
their positions secure, the present situa-
tion might have been avoided.
The second reason is more disturbing.
In our two most populous States most
of the trained men are servants of com-
missions, and suffer all the disadvan-
tages of the public service without hav-
ing the protection of the Public Service
Board. By regulation no Government
employee may complain to the press,
but those with permanent jobs can make
their presence felt by appealing to the
P.S. Board if injustice is done them.
The humble servant of the Forestry
Commission can be sacked without the
right of appeal.
Unfortunately, of all the Forestry
Commissioners ever appointed in Aus-
tralia only two have been technical men
—and this in a country that has boasted
two training grounds since 1910. The
men trained have not all had bad spins
—some of the Adelaide-Canberra gradu-
ates have done very well, since their
training is intensive enough to receive
universal welcome. However, from the
many splendid fellows turned out of
Creswick (Vic.) not a man has been
given a real opportunity to show his
stuff.
The trained treeman is not only bound
by regulation from fighting his own
battles; he spends most of his years in
the bush, without opportunities of join-
ing societies and getting at the ears of
the powerful.
“Train ’Em”: The bush having been
hacked to pieces, we need men trained
in forestry, which is much more than
checking sleepers and collecting royal-
ties. We already have the facilities to
train the men in Canberra. And we have
a host of young fellows passing through
our secondary schools and universities
who seem doomed to the dole unless
we order our affairs better.
Putting these simple facts together,
can’t we assure a trained forest service
for the future? For £2 a week, the wage
of a relief worker, we could get any
number of men with the requisite funda-
mental scientific training who would be
only too glad to spend two busy years at
the Forestry School if it gave them a
chance in life afterwards. If no more
additions were made to the forest ser-
vices except by this means, we would be
assured of an efficient organisation in
time to come, even if politics messed
things at present. Naturally, the scheme
would be confined to men with the neces-
sary fundamental equipment, but there
are plenty available—good hefties, too.

WHAT STREAMLINING MEANS TO
THE MOTORIST.
BY FRED BERRY.
BETTER PERFORMANCE, LOWER COSTS AND GREATER
SAFETY.
T"'\URING the last three years greater progress has been made
in automobile design than in any previous decade, and as
a consequence the motorist of to-day takes for granted extra-
ordinary power-to-weight ratios, coupled with practically
racing-car road performance, together with synchromesh and
constant-mesh gears, free-wheeling devices, automatic clutches,
fluid flywheels, pre-selective gearboxes, and a number of other
mechanical devices which go to eliminate the necessity for skill
in operation and render the car more nearly foolproof.
Few motorists, however, realise the
true significance of modern streamlining
and body design ; what it actually means
to them, not only in terms of operation
costs, but in reducing the trouble and
expense of maintaining a clean and un-
blemished exterior. Drivers who took a
pride in coachwork appearance were in
Closed cars in the future will be beautifully streamlined, with high stability and
uninterrupted vision for driver and passengers.
earlier years compelled to spend hours
at a time with hose and chamois to keep
the car reasonably clean, whereas to-day,
due to efficient streamlining, carefully
designed mudguarding and the general
use of cellulose lacquers for exterior
finish, the modern car can be made spick
and span in a matter of minutes.
This happy condition in the main is
due to the scrapping of the old system,
under which the designer of the motor
and chassis regarded bodywork as a

driven at speed. The smaller area of disturbance behind the
streamlined body means improved road performance.
mere afterthought. Now bodywork and
body profile are integral and important
parts in automobile design. The artist
and the scientist collaborate to combine
a pleasing exterior with a minimum of
wind resistance.
Mud-splashing.
In the matter of keeping the car clean,
modern design shows to great advantage
so far as mud-splashing is concerned.
Even though mudguards and valances may
be of area identical with those of a car
of earlier pattern, the air-streamed de-
sign collects less mud. Mudguard area
is not the deciding factor. For unless
the car is correctly streamlined the par-
ticles of dust, mud and tar disturbed by
the passage of the car will remain in
suspension, to be deposited in the most
uncomfortable positions, and will not
pass away in the slipstream.
In this connection the newer type of
domed-front guards with deep side val-
ances, together with complete fairing over
front dumb-irons, are particularly effec-
tive, for mud and dust disturbed by the
car’s progress are for the most part car-
ried parallel to the machine along a
smooth and regular slipstream. Further-
more, the considerable quantity of mud
and dust thrown
forward from the
tyre by centri-
fugal action of
the rapidly rotat-
ing wheel is now
trapped by the
deep front sec-
tio n s of the
guards instead of
being overtaken
and sprayed over
engine bonnet
and windshield,
as was the case
with older and less efficient types.
Of course, when the steering-wheel is
turned from centre, the tyre-tread, point-
ing outward, will inevitably throw some
mud into the air, to be drawn against the
side panels, but the only complete remedy
—that of totally enclosing the wheels—
although satisfactory from a point of
view of city driving, is extremely un-
popular with country motorists.
Ideal Slipstream.
It is, however, when the newer “back-
end” contours are studied that one be-
gins to appreciate the true value of
streamlining. Sceptical motorists need
only take stance beside a good fast
stretch of tarred roadway on a rainy day,
and watch what happens when different

types of bodies pass by. The older square
models will be observed pulling behind
them a heavy mist of vapor and mud ex-
tending to the roof and yards deep,
while the “beaver-tails” will, at worst,
generate only a shallow eddy. In addi-
tion, as the true streamline body is de-
void of pockets and corners, there are
no places for mud
to accumulate, and
.valeting the car is
greatly simplified.
There can be no
doubt that cars
with bodies de-
signed upon cor-
rect aero-dynamic
principles give bet-
te r performanc.es
than cars not so
equipped. As the
power output of
any given type of
engine is a known
factor, road per-
formance, which
includes maximum
speed, fuel con-
sumption and ac-
celeration, is gov-
erned to a marked
extent by body
style. The accom-
panying graph,
showing the power
absorbed in driv-
ing a flat surface
one foot square
through the atmo-
sphere at varying
speeds, will show
the motorist where
a lot of his power
goes when he at-
tempts high-speed
touring.
Streamlining gets
away from that
frictional flat sur-
face. With two
bodies of identical
frontal area, the
one nearest ap-
proaching a true
airfoil contour will
require less power
to drive it at a
given speed. Driv-
ers and designers:
of racing cars -do
not fit costly and
sometimes un-
wieldy “tails” to
the chassis for the
sake of appear-
ance, but to reduce skin friction and
minimise eddies and vacuum at rear
when travelling at high speed.
Speed Increase.
Experiments with airplane rigging dur-
ing the war proved conclusively that sub-
stituting “R.A.F.” wires of airfoil section
for round wires of identical cross-
section area resulted in an improvement
in air speed with a given power output.
Passenger comfort must be given close
consideration, for many motorists reckon
this feature as important as speed,
acceleration or fuel economy. Admit-
tedly early efforts at the construction of
streamlined bodies were not generally
successful. Rear-seat passengers were
either cramped for leg room or rode in
constant fear that at the next bump they
would be gazing at the road through
the rooftop. Modern designers, by
building the body into the chassis in-
stead of “perching” it on the cross-
members, have provided a comfortable
amount of space inside. As a conse-
quence, although it is now possible for
any normal person to stand beside a
large sedan and look over the roof, there

“Rumbermobile”: T. Rand, a pioneer
motorist and a foundation member of
the Vic. R.A.C., was one of 10 enthusiasts
who formed Melbourne’s first motorists’
club at the Port Phillip Club Hotel in
1903. The first outing was a run to
Mordialloc, and only five cars and seven
motor-cycles could be assembled for the
venturesome trip. In 1898 Rand was
using a motor-tricycle, and five years
later imported the first four-cylinder
car into Victoria. He relates that he
once made a journey from Melbourne to
Benalla in a 4-h.p. car. It took 15jr

Motor Oddities.
When motorists foregather the topics of conversation seldom centre in
technical or abstract features, but rather in personal experiences or
achievements.
Arguments wax hot where petrol consumption or speeds over specified
routes are concerned, and the cost of maintenance and the present mechanical
condition of cars after years of use are matters of extreme interest. Huge
annual mileages, old driving licenses, and perhaps low car numbers support
claims to experience, while many drivers, with characteristic Australian
ingenuity, have made interesting emergency repairs.
Who has driven more than 500,000 miles, and which driver covers the
greatest distance each year?
Thrills and extraordinary driving experiences have not been confined to
racing drivers, while outback the bush mechanic, hundreds of miles from
repair shops, has worked miracles in order to get the car home.
Motorists are invited to write to “The Bulletin" and recount their
experiences.

The Trouble Lamp.
N.F.W. (Marrickville, N.S.W.). —Front wheels
of my car shimmy when driving between tram-
lines on uneven suburban roads. Car has done
only 6000 miles. Wedges have been fitted under
front springs without effect.
Front wheels aro evidently out of alignment.
Go to one of the specialist stations and have
measurements carefully checked with precision
instruments. It costs only 7s. 6d., and a cure
is certain.
F.T. (Old Siding, N.Q.). —I use my car only
once each week. How can I prevent the battery
from going flat ?
If you have no means for home charging,
only method is to run the engine for an hour
every now and again. Batteries thrive on
hard and constant usage, but rapidly sulphate
if left idle.
R.P.H. (Roma, N.Q.). —My 1929 car has
just been rebored and iron pistons fitted. Now
she knocks on the overdrive after 20 m.p.h.,
but is all right when pulling. What should
/ do ? I also would like to use colloidal
graphite, but cannot get any here.
Added power as the result of the rebore
would show up bearing slackness in crank-
shaft. Take sump off and check up, otherwise
you may be heading for a costly repair bill.
Arrangements made for supply of graphite.
K.R.R. (Bungonia, N.S.W.). —What is your
opinion of the behavior and lasting qualities
of independent suspension ? Also your opinion
of two cars (named) ?
Both cars have been tested over Bulletin
course with satisfactory results. Car of editor
of this page is fitted with independent suspen-
sion and has given perfect satisfaction.
• F.A.W. (Bundanoon, N.S.W.).—(I) Weight of
Ford VS sedan, unladen ? (2) N.S.W. tax ?
(3) What type of shock-absorber is fitted ?
(1) 27cwt. (2) £8 6s. 6d. (3) Houdaille
double-acting hydraulic.
PJ. (Randwick, N.S.W.) and A.WJ. (Rose-
ville, N.S.W.). —Where can authoritative infor-
mation dealing with new ethyl petrols be
obtained ?
Vacuum Oil Co. will send a free booklet on
application.
L. (Mt. Mulligan, N.Q.). —More suitable
truck )or operation in hilly country with heavy
pulls (two makes named) ?
Advise similar type to that you have been
using, particularly as lower top gear is best
adapted to your conditions.
M. (Vaucluse, N.S.W.).— After 27,000
miles my six-cyl. car has been reground, and
there is now considerable “blow-by” audible
through breather pipe. (1) Is there generally
“blow-by” after regrinding ? (2) Does it wear
out ? (3) Is this audible in new cars ?
(1) Yes, frequently, persisting until the car
has run 1000 to 1500 miles. (2) Yes, time
depending upon fit of rings. (3) Conditions
are similar to those when cylinders are re-
bored.
J.G.M. (Temora, N.S.W.). —Where can 1 get
a correspondence course in engineering ?
Try Sydney Technical College, Ultimo.
E.S.B. (Wickham, N.S.W.). —Although my
six-cyl. 1933 model has only done 15,000 miles,
she overheats on long pulls, even in cold
weather. Also the battery does not seem to
hold its charge. Is a general overhaul neces-
sary ?
Car may need a top overhaul, but first
examine the condition of the rubber belt driv-
ing the generator, fan and water-impellor. If
this is slack it would account for all the
trouble.
D.O’B. (Seymour, Vic.). —Although mechanics
have had several tries at the carburettor of my
new car (free-wheeling), it sticks me up at the
most inconvenient times due to motor stalling.
Can you suggest a remedy ?
Some of the newer type of down-draught
carburettors are notoriously poor idlers unless
you happen to hit on the exact jet combina-
tion. Only certain cure is to speed up the
idling setting and keep the motor alive in
traffic.
3349. —Where can I get a new liming chain
for an old model S.C.A.T. ?
Cannot locate spare, but any timing chain
of similar pitch and width will serve the
purpose.
R.I. (Greymare, Q.). —Where are G.M.C. and
Federal four-ton truck parts obtainable in
Sydney ?
G.M.C. from W. H. Lober and Co., Phillip-
street, or Boyded, Ltd., Hunter-street; Federal
from H. W. Crouch, 26 Wentworth-avcnue —
all of Sydney.
T.S.W. (Tamworlh, N.S.W.). —A whirring
noise has developed in my motor. It begins
at 15 m.p.h. and disappears at 25 m.p.h. It
occurs uphill or down or on the level at these
speeds. Have dismantled the motor, but cant
find the trouble. What’s the cause ?
A characteristic of your engine, after lengtny
use, is that the timing wheels work up a
“flash between certain critical speeds Renew
timing wheels and the noise should disappear,

THE ANALYST RADIO TESTER.
BY DON B. KNOCK.
If the reader is enthusiastic about
home-construction of radio receivers, he
will realise that to indulge steadily in
receiver construction, with the measure
of service work which that entails, he
needs something more than a pocket
screwdriver, headphones and a pocket-
lamp battery as testing equipment. This
Page has already dealt with an easily-
made portable signal generator covering
a wide range of frequencies. Now there
is to be described a comparatively inex-
pensive test equipment, or analyser. To
the worker equipped with this and the
signal generator, no fault encountered
normally in modern radio apparatus
should present much difficulty in location.
Assuming that the reader likely to be
Circuit diagram of the analyser.
interested can read a circuit diagram, it
may be permissible to put the cart before
the horse, and start off with a list of
components to show just what the ana-
lyser comprises.
Analyser Components.
SWI, a double-pole, four-way rotary switch.
SW2, a six-point, single-pole rotary switch.
SW3, a two-way toggle switch.
B 1, 2 and 3, two-way, double-pole key switches
and buttons.
Four-pin jacks.
One small IJI-volt dry battery.
One grid cap and a pin-plug (’phone-tip).
One pair of prods.
One seven-pin valve socket (large, 59 valve type).
One seven-pin plug.
Four feet of eight-way cable.
One 0 to 1 milliamperemeter.
Adaptors: Eight required.
For the socket on the analyser panel —
Seven pins large, with seven holes small.
Seven pins large, with six holes.
Seven pins large, with five holes.
Seven pins large, with four holes.
For analyser plug —
Seven holes large, to or with seven pins small.
Seven holes large, to or with six pins.
Seven holes large, to or with five pins.
Seven holes large, to or with four pins.
The writer originally used a very cheap
meter for the milliamperemeter, but it is
advisable to procure one of the 1000-
ohms-per-volt type, of which there are
many now obtainable at reasonable
prices. Slade-Paton supply an excellent
four-scale universal type instrument com-
parable to much more expensive and
similar products at the price of 365. 6d.
Resistances.
Resistors Rl, 2,3, 4, 5 and 6 should
be of precision type, and can be obtained
in the well-known makes, but the writer
used types of more reasonable price but
good design (Chanex), and checked them
for resistance on a dealer’s very expensive
analyser. These resistors are adequate
for average service requirements, and it
must be considered that this is an in-
expensive analyser. Rl is 10,000 ohms,
R 2 100,000 ohms, R 3 250,000 ohms, R 4
500,000 ohms, these being the multipliers
for voltage measurements; and the
shunts, R 5 and R 6, for milliampere mea-
surement, had better be obtained with the
meter. If the reader already has a meter
on hand, calculation and calibration of
the shunts is not a difficult process. For
a 0 to lOma. indication, the meter will
carry a tenth of the total current, and
the shunt nine-tenths. The general for-
mula is:
Rm x Im
R equals
I Im
Where R is resistance of the shunt in ohms;
Rm resistance of the meter in ohms;
Im full scale current for the meter;
and I full scale current for new calibration.
In case of any confusion on this score,
the constructor had better obtain the
shunts with the meter, the cost of each,
for 10 and 100 milliamperes respectively,
being only 2s. 6d.
Key Switches.
These can be made from discarded
jacks, as in the case of the original, but,
if purchase is preferred, they should cost
about 4s. each. SW2 is made from an
old rheostat, and these can be picked up
almost for the asking. The resistance is
removed and six holes are drilled in the
band of the rheostat, screwing soldering
tags into the holes and bending them
over. A similar way of making this
switch from a rheostat, but with wire
bound together and soldered, was illus-
trated previously (B. 25/7/’34). Quite
a satisfactory rotary switch can be made
in this simple manner.
SWI is easily made from two equal
pieces of bakelite, countersinking four
flat-headed screws equidistantly in a
semicircle, and securing with nuts on the
reverse side, thus making the two bakelite
pieces with four studs in each. The two
switch arms are secured lin. apart from
each other on a |in. bakelite rod passed
through the centre of the bakelite pieces.
Old condenser shaft collars can be used
to secure the switch spindle in position.
Again, if the reader prefers the manu-
factured article, such switches can be
obtained at a reasonable price from
Slade-Paton Co., Croydon, N.S.W.
Adaptors and Plugs.
The large 7-pin socket is recommended
as the most convenient for the adaptors;
a 7-pin large plug, augmented by a grid
connection on the side, also being re-
quired. An old type-59 valve base will
serve here, and the grid connection is but
a grid cap from an old valve secured
through the top to the side of the base
by a screw. It is advisable to extend the
valve base for handling, and this is
easily done by using a 4in. length of
broomstick, drilled throughout its length.
The grid connection cap is secured to the
top of the handle, and the handle painted
black for the sake of appearance. If
the commercial article is desired, it costs
ss. 6d. from the maker.
The eight-way battery cable is fitted
into the handle, and the connections
made to the pins in the valve base
accordingly. Switch SW3 calls for
comment. When this is over to the grid
position, analysis of the type-59 valve
is provided for, and with other types of
valves the other position is used. A
useful scheme is to paste in the lid of the
completed instrument a valve chart,
adapted from the Radiotron chart
(A.W.A.) ; or, better still, keep handy a
copy of the “Radiotron Designer’s Hand-
book,” which is an excellent shilling’s-
worth.
Operation Points.
At rest the keys connect the circuits
selected to the meter for voltage read-
ing, and to ascertain the current in the
same circuit all that is needed is to press
the required button and milliamperes are
shown on the meter. The turning of
SW2 to the required position for milli-
amperes must not be overlooked; 10
or 100 as the case may be. The rest of
the operation and circuit construction is
obvious from the diagram illustrated. If
A.C. reading is wanted in addition, the
inclusion of a copper oxide rectifier for
the meter is easily done. Westinghouse
issues a brochure on the subject, and the
price of the rectifier is 325. 6d.
The size of the panel for the analyser
and the general appearance is left to the
reader. In the case of the original, using
a very cheap temporary meter, the total
cost to the writer was £2 to construct,
including the carrying case. It is well
worth the construction, for this indispen-
sable instrument gives access to any
circuit under examination.

THE WILD WAVES.
In the more or less happy days of my
childhood there were few concerts at
which a young lady and a young gentle-
man (sometimes they weren’t very young)
did not arise and sing a beautiful duet
based on Paul’s question to Florence in
“Dombey and Son”: “What are the wild
waves saying, sister, the whole day
long?” Little did we kids .think, as we
sat there listening, that curiosity on the
subject of waves would lead to an era in
which it would be possible to hear Miss
Smith and Mr. Brown singing though
they were a hundred miles away, or even
long after they were dead.
Of course, we weren’t entirely ignorant
about waves. Those
of us who had done
physics had heard
of Newton’s theory
about light-—that it
consists of little bul-
lets thrown out by
the sun —a view bit-
terly opposed by
Fresnel, who was all
for the wave theory.
Nowadays the scien-
tists have gone half-
way back to Newton, holding that
light and electrical radiations have
the nature of bullets when they start
out and bullets when they arrive
somewhere, but that they are waves
while on the journey (a view sup-
ported by actual photographs in Prof.
Jeans’s latest tome). Also we knew a bit
about the physical basis of sound —how
low notes had fewer vibrations to the
second than high notes. There were some
notes on the church organ so low that
you could almost count the beats. But
we had never heard of electrons, the
triode was to us a sealed book, and we
didn’t know there was such a science as
thermionics. We were a set of ignora-
muses!
Waves, it appears in the light ol:
modern science, are really the most im-
portant things in nature. Without them
the universe would be as dead as a door-
nail, if it had any existence whatever,
which seems to be highly unlikely. What
causes waves isn’t known —probably
never will be known —but the world is
constantly learning more about what they
can do. Radio transmission of sound
may prove to be the least of the practical
applications of wave theory. Claims have
been made recently that the wave-length
of human thought has been ascertained ;
that thought impulses have been trans-
formed into sound, and that they have
been proved to be identifiable. That
opens up terrifying possibilities, not only
to malefactors and to those gentlemen
who are able to forget all details of their
business when giving evidence before a
Royal Commission, but to all of us. To
know what people really think would be
almost as bad sis knowing the future.
However, the tide of science cannot be
stemmed, and we’ll have to make the
best of it.
An essential thing about waves is that
they have an ordered rhythm, and the
world is just beginning to appreciate
what can be done with rhythm. Some
future historian will perhaps be able to
define exactly what the nigger tom-tom-
ming of jazz has done to Uncle Sam. To
some observers it seems as if a whole
nation’s politics, finance and social out-
look had been subtly infected. Here’s
what an Australian educational autho-
rity, Walter Hunt, said on the subject
of rhythm recently: “Rhythm and metre
in speed, as in music, have the

power of throwing the listener into a
state of heightened susceptibility to emo-
tional suggestion—the recurrence of
a regular rhythmical beat has an almost
hypnotic effect; it completely detaches
our attention from the world of every-
day, and, if it is monotonous and regular
enough, actually sends us to sleep.” Mr.
Hunt was advocating the selection for
broadcasting of plays in which there is
rhythmical beauty, of diction—the sort
that stimulates the imagination instead of
inducing sleep—but . his observation,
which is no mere platitude, has a much
wider application. Radio is a means of
transmitting rhythm to an audience that
daily grows wider,, which eventually may
become, on occasions, world-wide. Al-
ready there is on the market in America
a device on radio-audio principles to send
people to sleep—it produces what ap-
pears to be a dull, low moaning. When
more is known about that sort of busi-
ness it may be necessary in war-time to
equip sentinels with ear-stops to keep
them awake. There may be other
rhythms that produce temporary insan-
ity (those used by crooners already have
that effect on some people), and yet
others that will curl the hair, bringing
Marcel into line with Marconi on a
wave basis. There are many other, and
darker, possibilities, but enough has been
said to indicate that this matter of waves,
hitherto mostly studied by scientific
specialists, is beginning to concern all
humanity. Waves hitherto have been
our servants, or we thought they were,
What if they are becoming our masters?

INTERNATIONAL ADVANTAGES OF
AMATEUR RADIO.
To the majority of listeners using all-
wave or short-wave receivers, the dots
and dashes of the amateur transmitter
are a sealed book. The Morse code is
the barrier, but it does not remain a
barrier for long when the listener gets the
urge to master this means of contact over
long distances, and to be in on the fun.
The ranks of amateur transmitters are
swelling, recruited from the increasing
number of broadcast listeners possessing
the means of short-wave reception, and
Australia is no exception. A layman,
taken to an Australian amateur trans-
mitting station and informed that
hundreds of individuals with home-
made apparatus converse intelligently
with fellow-beings in remote parts
of the world, is considerably impressed.
With such simple, home-constructed apparatus, the amateur
transmitter breaks down international barriers and seals world-
wide friendships.
To the amateur such communication is
an old story. The wide world is to him,
by the medium of his Morse key, packed
with pleasures and thrills.
He has thousands of friends, friends
he may possibly never meet in person;
but if he should visit those distant coun-
tries he can rely upon a hearty hand-
shake and welcome from Americans,
Englishmen, Frenchmen, Japanese, Chin-
ese, Germans and members of nationali-
ties too numerous to mention. The lay-
man wonders how on earth radio experi-
menters of widely different modes of fife
and language can understand each other.
A language almost akin to Esperanto has
resulted by the constant use of interna-
tional abbreviations. When the Austra-
lian says “73, GE, OM” to the man at
the other end, who may be in Russia or
Timbuctoo, he means “Greetings, good
evening, friend,” and the expression is
understood. This amateur language is
not confined to platitudes, and complete
conversation is often conducted by means
of what is termed “radioese.”
The international aspect of amateur
radio communication is interesting. In
a world seething with alarms, discontent
and racial differences, the radio enthu-
siast is entirely unaffected. The son of
a wealthy landowner in a thoroughly
bourgeois country can, and does, tell the
son of a Bolshevik that he is a jolly good
fellow, and mean what he says, and vice
versa. That sort of communication surely
should be a fac-
tor in preserv-
ing peace. Yet
some countries
prohibit inter-
national com-
munication, and
e x p e r i mental
communications
are confined to
their own boun-
daries. Other
countries pro-
h i b i t amateur
transmission al-
together, not-
ably Italy. The
U.S.A. stands
out as a nation
where amateur
radio communi-
cation is realised
to be something more than a hobby.
By reason of large numbers and wide-
spread organisation, amateur communi-
cations have played an important part in
providing emergency links in times of
floods, earthquakes, hurricanes and other
disasters, and the American amateur is
considered, and rightly so, an asset to his
community. There have been isolated
instances in Australia of the amateur’s
worth, and Maoriland has an organ-
ised amateur radio emergency corps
which is always ready for service in the
event of earthquake or other national
trouble. The status of the amateur trans-
mitter is an important one, and in view
of his past record and possible utility in
the future he should be encouraged to
the utmost.

Country Short-wave Observations.
Conditions are rapidly assuming the
summer trend, for around 6 to 7 a.m.
quite good reception has been possible
on both the 25 and 31m. bands. In the
25m. band FYA, 25.2, has been strongest,
with GSD very close and DJD only fair.
In the 31m. band GSB, 31.5, has been
quite the best, with DJA very good, and
a foreigner at the bottom of the band,
not yet placed, also at good strength.
Several Americans have been heard, but
very weakly. The German station now
asks for reports from Maoriland and
Australia. At first Australia was quite
ignored ; apparently the station did not
expect such interest here, transmissions
being intended for Asia and Africa.
On Sept. 5, 9.30 p.m., W2XAF was
testing with 2ME with all its former
strength. Evidently some big broad-

PMY, 58m„ has been again excellent
most nights, but the D.E.I. station on
49.2 m. has been considerably weaker,
though still fair strength. Several nights
between 11 and midnight what appears
to be Saigon (from the type of music),
on 48.9, has been excellent. This would
probably be F3ICD. In the 49m. band

strong at 9.30 when starting its early-
morning session, and at 10 p.m. W9XAA
has been fair, but soon faded out.
WBXAL’s starting bugle is a good
mark of distinction.
GSB, 31.5 m., has been good speaker
strength until closing time, with volume
having to be reduced. A recent week-
end was disappointing, as after 7.30 a.m.
on Sunday most stations were poor until
FYA came on with its last session. Later
on GSB was even better. HBL was too
weak to copy at 8.30 a.m., and so was
the short-wave session from WBXK. The
broadcast-band session was followed at
times, and part of an announcement that
a station (the name of which could not
be caught owing to fading) would broad-
cast a special DX programme for M.L.
and Australia. The announcement of
power sounded like 1000 kilowatts, but
that seems wrong. 500 kw. .is believed
to be the maximum used in America
so far.
RNE has been consistently good at 12
p.m., but still very weak in the 9 p.m.
Sunday session.
The 20m. band has very few Ameri-
cans now in the afternoon, but one hears
an odd European coming through (on
code) in the early mornings.
The 80m. band has been very good for
several nights, with low noise level, and
Westralians at good strength. There
were many good ’phone stations on the
40m. band on a recent Sunday, but fad-
ing was very bad. Most consistent re-
sults came from South Australia. Some
really excellent music was heard from
a Sydney station at full speaker strength,
although I am over 300 miles from Syd-
ney and the power used is low.

City Short-wave Explorations-
The tests between W2XAF Schenec-
tady (U.S.A.) on 31.48 m. and VK2ME
have been providing short-wave listeners
with excellent entertainment. On each
occasion before the tests W2XAF has
relayed the early-morning session from
WGN New York —physical exercises
done to music.
During the tests arrangements were
made to broadcast the centenary air race
throughout the U.S.A., also the arrival
of the Duke of Gloucester in Sydney
through all North America, evidence of
the interest the rest of the world is tak-
ing in Melbourne’s centenary celebra-
tions. The broadcasts should provide a
great advertisement for this country,
W2XAF arranged to record a descrip-
don 0 £ tbe America’s Cup races, and

air about ?15 p . m . when
signals are weak, but they rapidly build
up, and by 8.15 are at excellent loud-
speaker strength.
Russian stations have been putt ng
through very good signals. On a recent
Saturday REN, on 46.6 m., came on the
air at 1 a.m. and transmitted an mterest-
ing musical programme. At 1.55 p.m.
the following Sunday RNE was heard
on 25.2 m., transmitting its usual Eng-
fish session, and signals were very strong.
RVIS Khabarovsk, on 70.2 m., has been
received at good strength on every occa-
sion heard. The Japanese station JVN,
27.9 m., has been heard nightly, and has
shown considerable improvement.
WIXAZ Springfield (U.S.A.), on
31.35 m., now reaches good speaker
strength at 10 p.m., but is not nearly as
strong as the other American station,
W2XAF.
The transmission of the Empire sta-
tion from 4.15 to 6.15 p.m. has been well
received, strongest signals coming from
GSB. GSF has also put in an appear-
ance after 10 p.m., but is still so weak
as to be of little account. No sign has
yet been heard this week of FYA during
the evenings, though this station con-
tinues to come in very well during the
mornings.

There is still romance, even in radio.
Franklin S. Huddy, owner and operator
of American amateur radio station
WIZS, learned that the lady of his
admiration had practised the Morse code.
Whereupon he suggested listening to his
station, and popped the question per the
medium of his transmitting key. Diana
had evidently learnt the code thoroughly,
for the reply was acceptance. It was the
first complete Morse message she had
ever copied, and Mrs. WIZS is now a
firm supporter of amateur radio.

A new short-wave transmitting station
is at present undergoing installation at
Tandjong Priok, D.E.1., the apparatus
having been designed in the Philips
Dutch factories. The wave-length range
will be between 40 and 80 metres, and
the aerial power will be 10 kilowatts.
This station should be well received in
Australia.

An ingenious radio transmitter, the
SOS, has been marketed in England,
primarily for amateur yachtsmen and
users of small boats. A single switch
brings the whole transmitter into opera-
tion, and Morse code is transmitted by
drawing a special pencil across slots
representing different letters. In Austra-
lia, the Australian Inland Mission uses
the Morse typewriter, the result of the
research work of a South Australian
amateur.

The latest in motion-picture science
is the electron-controlled high-speed
camera. With the ordinary motion-pic-
ture camera the start-stop action of the
film limits the number of pictures taken
to 200 per second. In the electron-con-
rolled camera a thyratron tube is used
in place of the shutter, and mercury
vapor tubes flash once for each picture
in the frame. “Electronics” (U.S.A.) re-
produced a picture taken on the impact of
a golf club with the ball, the picture
speed being 960 per second. The result
showed that the golf club and ball were
in contact less than 1-1000th of a second,
that the ball picked up a speed of more
than two miles a minute, and that it
spun at 5000 revolutions per minute.
Casual Comment.
Par. in a U.S.A. radio journal: “If
the radio-set advertisers are right, the
Lord did a very poor job with the
human ear.”

The ownership of an amateur radio
station is often something more than a
hobby. In cases of isolation it can help
to pass weary hours by keeping touch
with one’s fellow-men. Thus W7BKC
to VK2NO: “Location here is 4800 ft.
above sea-level, and at any time now
will be snowed under 10 or 12ft. This
is a Government weather bureau, and I
am the only person here; nearest town
is 20 miles down the mountain. Every
15 minutes during my watch, which is
from 4 a.m. to 4 p.m., I take barometer
and other readings, and if it wasn’t
for chatting with the gang by amateur
radio I would fall asleep at times. Cold
in Sydney? Guess you ought to try
this; 10 below zero at times.”

An American, W6CGM, has raised an
objection to the use of the word “ama-
teur” to denote the transmitting fraternity
of experimenters. He claims that by use
of the word the public is given the im-
pression that the experimenters are
-novices. He suggests the word “transa-
tician,” and has gone so far as to ob-
tain a copyright. The word is perhaps
no more objectionable than “technician”
as applied to radio, but “amateur,” in its
true sense, so nearly fits the case that
it will take a lot of supplanting.
The amateur monthly “R 9” (U.S.A.)
announces the appointment of Robert S.
Kruse as technical editor. Kruse
needs no introduction to old-time experi-
menters, for he was for many years
technical editor of the magazine “QST.”
An interesting feature of this appoint-
ment is that “R 9” office is in Los
Angeles, California, and Kruse’s office in
Guildford, Connecticut. Radio will be
used to link the technical editor with his
newspaper, and to relay technical infor-
mation from the laboratory on the east
coast.

“R.F.”: Charging the A battery may
be one of the big problems of the out-
back wireless set, but with battery super-
hets the difficulty in some climates is
to keep them going at ajl. At a cane
ranch near Bartle Frere (N.Q.) writer
made a service call on a seven-valve
autodyne battery superhet. After two
hours of trying all the tricks, including
checking batteries, short circuits, valve
voltages and currents, new valves, rais-
ing bias, lowering bias, juggling screen-
grid voltages, etc., The Bulletin’s sketch
of the man who had “come to fix the
wireless” was no longer a joke but a
suggestion. Reference by the owner to
the damp weather fostered an idea. I
bundled the set into the oven alongside
a batch of scones. Fifteen minutes of
heat treatment resulted in connecting the
batteries just in time to hear the last
afternoon item from 4TO Townsville.
A lighted kerosene lamp, turned down
low, now adorns the inside of the cabinet,
and six months have gone by without
a repetition of the trouble.
Crystal-set Loudspeaker Reception.
Quite a number of people still use the
humble crystal set; as the cricket Tests
revealed. The question may arise, can
one expect a crystal set to jjeliver loud-
speaker results? It is all a matter of the
inductance value. Examination of the
archives of early radio reception, when
the crystal was the sole means to the
end, shows that for DX large induct-
ances and little or no capacity were the
order of the day. The crystal affair here
described gives good
speaker results up
to within 20 miles of
a local station, with,
of course, a good
outdoor aerial.
Tuning is done by
an extra large vari-
ometer using heavy
gauge wire. A good
size to work with is
16-gauge cotton in-
sulated wire with 22
turns on each end of
a 10-inch stator.
The rotor is 6|in. in
diameter, and has
22 turns of 18-gauge
wire on each end.
No insulating var-
nish or “d op e”
should be used on
the coils. Such a
variometer may
seem unwieldy, but
in the writer’s case signal strength is quite
equal to the average one-valver.
S. G. (Vic.).
Safeguarding the A.C. Receiver.
Not all manufactured electric radio
receivers are safe. As a dealer of wide
experience, the writer is in a position
to say so. Recently an extreme case of
what can happen to an unsafe receiver
came my way. Called in to examine a
receiver which had overheated and caused
a fire, damaging the cabinet to such an
extent that a new one was necessary,
I found the trouble due to the break-
ing down of a filter condenser. The
sequence of events was that a power
transformer, under severe strain, over-
heated and the insulation ignited. This
transformer was of the unshielded
variety, and the flames set the cabinet
on fire, the top of the chassis being
close to the upper portion of the cabinet.
This is a case in a hundred ; but there are
many receivers on the market with un-
shielded power transformers. Apart from
the question of fire, there are on record
countless cases of power transformers,
rectifier valves and speaker fields ruined
by similar short-circuits. The remedy
illustrated in the diagram is simple, and
manufacturers should consider the fitting
of such a high-voltage fuse. The wire
connecting the centre-tap of the high-
voltage secondary on the power trans-
former is unsoldered, and in series to
earth is connected a pocket-lamp bulb-
holder. Should a component break
down, causing a short in the H.T., the
lamp will blow, and no further damage
will result. What is needed is a moulded
lamp-holder, designed for a single-hole
fixing, with the lamp projecting above
the top of the chassis for accessibility.
Such lamps are infinitely cheaper than
new rectifiers, speakers or power trans-
formers.
C. J. C.
Transmitter Technique.
The experimenter concerned with low-
power short-wave transmission uses fixed
capacities of the receiving condenser
kind, and finds them suitable. Should
something more than a two- or five-watt
affair be attempted, the condensers in-
tended for use in receivers where R.F.
voltages are extremely low are likely to
puncture or develop leakage troubles.
Fixed condensers with air dielectric give
freedom from condenser trouble, and
allow much higher power to be used.
Construction is not difficult, and the illus-
tration shows how the fixed plates from
old variable condensers may be utilised.
Such variable condensers, with inter-
plate turned washers, are obtainable for
a shilling or two at second-hand radio
stores. The base used for the mounting
must be of good insulating material for
R.F. current, and the spacing of plates
may be arranged as desired, depending
upon the length of the screws and the
number of spacing washers.
VK2NO.
The Q. and A. Column.
I have been a radio serviceman for a period
of eight years. What textbooks should I study
in order to enable me to become proficient in
radio engineering ? —129.
“Admiralty Handbook of Wireless Tele-
graphy,” 12s. 6d.; “Practical Radio Telegraphy
and Telephony,” by Duncan and Drew, 81s.
6d. —both from Angus and Robertson. “Elec-
tronics” (U.S.A.) and other technical magazines
should be regularly read, and theoretical studies
should be accompanied by practical work at a
recognised school of radio engineering.
I have been trying to obtain the utmost
volume from a crystal set, 25 miles south of
4MK, using the simple direct circuit. The
coil is low loss, wound with 18 -gauge wire
spaced equal to its diameter and supported on
a frame 4in. in diameter. Can I improve on
this ? What is the best kind of detector ?
—l3l.
The only improvement would be the elimina-
tion of tuning capacity by making the coil
with a larger number of turns and tapping it
by a clip at the necessary inductance. It will
only be suitable for use on the one station.
Another way is to make a large variometer,
(see reference on this page). Obtain some
galena, and test pieces of this until a particu-
larly sensitive piece is found.
I intend building the Wide-World Two (B.
15/8/’34), but using a type-15 valve as de-
tector and a Mallard PM22A audio stage. Will
it be necessary to alter the circuit or the values
of any of the components ? —l3O.
This two-volt version will be quite good, and
no alteration is necessary in the coil data or
the components generally. The difference is
that the 15 has the suppressor grid connected
internally to cathode. Battery bias should be
used on the PM22A.
The bandspread system in the Sargent 9-33
receiver (“ A.R.N.” 15/12/’33) has me puzzled.
Are the two single condensers ganged and the
oscillator condenser tuned separately ?— 135.
In the receiver designed by the originator a
mechanical device was used to move the stators
of the ganged condensers slightly and thus
secure a spread effect. The description in
“Radio News” was meant to imply that the
usual parallel small capacity could be used for
bandspreading in the normal way. The oscil-
lator condenser is the separately controlled cir-
cuit.
We have a 100 -volt 25 a. electric-lighting plant.
Is it possible to obtain an electric set for this
with short-wave tuning suitable for use in the
tropics ? Where could one be obtained ? —136.
There are various ways of doing this, and
the best way would be by the use of a self-
contained small motor-generator outfit as used
with the modern motor-car receiver. Try Mur-
doch’s, Ltd., Radio Dept., Park-street, Sydney.

I am using the Wide-World Two receiver (B.
15/8/’34). Hand capacity is bad when the hand
is placed near the three-plate midget aerial-
coupling condenser. How can this be elimi-
nated ? I am using a 2000 -ohm bias resistor
for the 38. Would the 100-olim resistor recom-
mended make much difference in signal
strength ? A circuit showing the addition of
another valve for speaker reception would be
appreciated. —l 3 2.
It is natural that, upon placing the hand
close to the grid circuit, detuning will occur.
If you wish to alter the aerial coupling, minus
hand capacity, it will be necessary to arrange
the condenser with a long insulated shaft pro-
jecting through the front panel, and controlled
by a knob. The smaller value of resistor will
increase the audio gain, but also the B-battery
drain. Also, due to the characteristics of the
38 pentode, it may be necessary to by-pass the
plate of this valve to earth by a .006 mfd. mica
condenser to lower the tone. The circuit you
request was published B. 5/9/’34.
Have made the Wide-World Two, following
the design as closely as possible, but using
material on hand and the 2.5 valves, 57 and 56.
The set is a wonder, but I cannot get it to
oscillate below about 24 metres. Circuit dia-
gram enclosed. Any suggestions ? —133.
The first thing is to try various 57 valves.
Some are more ready oscillators in this cir-
cuit at high frequencies than others. Next,
remove the aerial, and, if oscillation is present
over the whole tuning range, you are using
too tight an aerial coupling. A smaller aerial
condenser will then be necessary. The R.F.
choke in the plate circuit of the 57 may be
the trouble. The three-section R.C.S. type is
recommended. Removal of the .0001 mid.
condenser C 8 may also effect a cure. A
high-impedance audio choke is advised in place
of the 250,000-ohm coupling resistor now in
use. Fundamentally there is nothing wrong
with the diagram.
I am using a Quality superhet (" A.R.N .”
11 /5/’34) and find this receiver to be everything
claimed for it. The only complaint is a ten-
dency to hum, which at times is rather notice-
able between items. How can this be pre-
vented ? —137.
In this receiver the 750-ohm speaker field
is used in the high-voltage secondary centre-tap
to earth instead of in the positive supply. The
inclusion of a 30-henry lOOma. filter choke in
the positive lead, between the two 8 mfd. elec-
trolytic condensers, will provide very complete
filtering and should remove entirely any residual
hum.
In the portable signal generator (B. 12/9/’34)
(1) should LI be 270 or 370 turns ? (2) Would
Philips J 5443 and 8406 be suitable in place of
the 33 and 30 valves ? (3) Is it possible to use
the signpl generator without an output meter ?
If not, has one been described in The Bul-
letin ? —l3B.
(1) LI is 270 turns, and the variable con-
denser is .0005 mfd. (2) Yes. (3) Yes, by listen-
ing to the modulated signal from the oscillator
via the receiver loudspeaker. A receiver can be
lined up reasonably well by ear, but an output
meter gives extreme accuracy. An output meter
diagram was illustrated (B. 25/7/’34).
Referring to question No. 103 (B. 29/8/’34)
“D.G.M.” (Mount Isa, Q.) suggests that the
station on 658 kc. unidentified is probably
XGOA, Nanking, China. He hears this station
(just above 2FC) each evening. A news ser-
vice is frequently given in English between
10.40 and 11 p.m. The power of XGOA is 75
kilowatts.


Good Health results
from interna/
Cleanness"
explains Dr. F. de COURMELLES
—of the Paris Society of Practising Physicians and Surgeons.
DO YOU suffer from every ailment that happens? Have
you constipation, indigestion, gastritis, rheumatism,
neuritis, backache, weakness of any organ, catarrh?
Do you get frequent headaches, catch cold easUy? Is your
appetite poor—vitality lacking? These and many other ail-
ments are caused because you unconsciously permit poisons
that bring on disorder and disease to remain in your system.
SELF-POISONING-the basic cause of
m
Mi
£
m
most ill-health
The modern refined foods we eat
do not stimulate the bowel
muscles to sufficient action. No
matter how regular your daily
habits, particles of food waste be-
come encrusted on the walls and
crevices of the intestine, and breed
germ - producing poisons which
enter the blood-stream. These
poisons undermine your health —
taking power from the life-giving
organs of nature —making you old
years before your time. It is this
condition of SELF - POISONING
or autoxima that physicians de-
clare to be the basic cause of most
ill-health. Self-poisoning is all the
more to be dreaded because it is
so insidious —you suffer, but do not
know that this toxic condition is the
cause of your sufferings.

COLOSEPTIC.
THE SCIENTIFIC WAY
to keep your body internally clean
Modem medicine has formulated
a preparation specially designed to
combat insidious self - poisoning—
COLOSEPTIC. This effective inter-
nal cleanser softens the hardened
particles of food-waste and sweeps
the germ and
poison - producing
matter right out
of the system—
without pain or
inconvenience.
Taken regularly, COLOSEPTIC
tones up the whole intestinal tract
so that the "bowels function natur-
ally and regularly. By its action
on the kidneys, the pores of the
skin and the respiratory tract—
Nature’s other outlets for the dis-
posal of bodily impurities—
COLOSEPTIC cleanses the polluted
blood-stream.
DRINK COLOSEPTIC EVERY
MORNING
Wash the pent-up poisons from the body.
Internal cleanness will alone bring you
back the joy of perfect health. Drink
COLOSEPTIC in hot water every morning.
COLOSEPTIC increases the secretion of
the gastric and intestinal juices—improves
your digestion and brings back your appe-
tite. It combats lassitude, fatigue, “blues”
and other symptoms of self-poisoning.
Gives you, instead, the sparkling vigour
of youth, glowing eyes, clear complexion
and a new outlook on life.
Start a course of COLOSEPTIC to-day
and watch how soon your health improves.
Post Coupon for 10-Day Jar
COLOSEPTIC is obtainable in regular full-
size jars from all chemists, sufficient for
several weeks’ regular use. Test it for
yourself. Fill in coupon and send with

THE GREATEST BENEFIT
I have used COLOSEPTIC regularly now for the
past six months for Stomach Troubles, with the
greatest benefit. And I have also been the means
of many others trying it with equal success. It is
a wonderful remedy.

“L. 1.8.”: Those Australian Light
Horsemen who have retained memories
of Jaffa and its orange groves will
learn with interest that the Jaffa
swimming club has written to Australia
for a surf reel, line and belt of
the design used throughout Australia
to-day. Times have evidently changed,
for, as far as the writer can recall the
people of Jaffa and its vicinity, none
looked as if he or she had ever had a
bathe since Noah’s flood subsided. There
are some Australian residents now and a
garrison of British troops. The drown-
ing of two of these recently started the
move for proper life-saving apparatus.

“Spadassin”: Historical relics are, if
possible, more deceiving than historical
facts. I have been moved to the reflec-
tion by studying a picture of naval offi-
cers at Plymouth. One of them holds in
his hand a huge sword, said to have been
“the one with which Queen Elizabeth
knighted Drake.” In Elizabeth’s day all
men wore the handy and elegant cut-and-
thrust sword, with its elaborate hilt; the
thing the sailorman is holding is a huge,
cross-hilted cutter of the type that
went out soon after the Crusades. I have
seen a couple ; they were collected by
Australian Light Horsemen in the cam-
paign against the Senussi. They weigh
about 151 b. each, and if Bess was mug
enough to use the clumsy weapon instead
of one of the handsome blades of her
entourage she was not the lass I hive
taken her for.
“Adsum”: That prohibition of royal
photos, and emblems as trade decorations
is short-sighted. In Britain manufacture of
anything s likely t 0 appca , to rejoicing
crowc j s j s allowed to be well plastered
w j t h pictures relative to the royal family,

“Centre Court”: A new departure in
British tennis organisation has been
made. The E.L.T.A. has taken over the
defunct professional T.A. and started off
by holding a tournament for the openly-
paid people. Before that the profes-
sionals dwelt in outer darkness, and could
barely raise enough to pay tram fares
from their exhibitions.
* * * * „
, N ,Yark : They call them golf
hums in my country. A few do well:
Bobby Jones looks like cleaning up a
million dollars before another idol super-
sedes him— : but then Bobby is one in a
hundred million. The average young
man who on leaving school acquires a
scratch handicap or thereabouts at the
same time acquires a killing handicap in
life’s struggle. If he takes up a profes-
sion the public refuses to identify him
with it, so long as he goes on getting
golfing publicity ; and a time soon comes
when the public wonT have him at any
price except as a golfer. Three avenues
are then open: he can turn pro., start
a sports shop, or become a golf writer
—three of the most overcrowded callings
on earth. My advice to parents who find
their boy habitually doing par figures or
better is: “Smash or sell his sticks and
take his name off his golf club.” The
par habit, to those who must make their
way in life, is more dangerous than
drink.

“Lex”: “The Reichstag Fire Trial,”
just published by The Bodley Head, con-
tains examples of Nazi judicial
methods calculated to stagger Austra-
lians. General Goring, under cross-
examination by the accused Dimitrov,
gave answers such as “You are nothing
but a scoundrel who belongs to the gal-
lows.” Dimitrov’s last question was:
“You are very afraid of my questions,
are you not, Herr Minister?” Where-
upon Goring, “literally dancing with
rage,” shouted: “Out with you, you
crook!” and as the police dragged his
interrogator off, “You wait till I get you
out of the power of this Court!” Last
year Hitler sued a journalist for saying
that Skoda (the munitions firm) had con-
tributed to the Nazi campaign expenses.
Asked to deny the charge on oath, Hitler
refused, and cursed plaintiff’s lawyer for
a Jew. The explanation doesn’t appear
to be that Germany is under a dictator-
ship ; in Italy the Fascist bosses adhere
outwardly to the legal conventions of
modern civilised countries. With all their
splendid moral and intellectual qualities
the Prussians remain well back in the
Dark Ages in many social respects. It
is significant that they should have re-
tained the headsman’s block and be mak-
ing free use of it.

“Barah Peg”: The Indian potentate’s
habit of celebrating or doing penance by
the gold-coin method has led to more
serious consequences than befel “Bukshi
Sahib” (B. 12/9/’34). During the second
Mysore War it nearly, cost Australia her
most progressive Governor and some his-
toric colonists. Just as Cornwallis was
about to put the final kibosh on Tippoo
Sahib (a person with nine wives and
mutton-chop whiskers), a subaltern on
the staff of John Company’s Mahratta
allies was caught with the wife of his
brigade major or somebody: Thereupon
the whole Mahratta army abandoned
operations for a few days while its
general staff weighed itself in silver to be
cast into the Cauvery as a purification.
For a little while, the life of Captain
Lachlan Macquarie, in command of the
Colonel’s company of the 77th with
Abercrombie’s army, was in serious
danger, along with the lives of a number
of other gallant gentlemen who were
braving a shortage of Madeira above the
Ghauts.

“Hairy”: Baldheaded people are sup-

O’Reilly, McCabe, Grimmett and Chip-
perfield can all offer eligible opportunities

course. Bradman and Grimmett have

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
The Clarendon track was at its best
y for the spring meeting of the old Hawkes-
bury club. The attendance, a record, sur-
prised the committee. Starter Lamrock
; adopted the walk-up principle in the nine
events, and despite the unruliness of most
of the starters the dispatches were excel-
lent. Bookmakers had the better of the
perennial argument.
Autopay (7 to 4) captured the Flying
Handicap from an outsider, Rona Val-
ley, and the well-backed Wee Warrah.
Though on the rails, the Paper Money
horse soon dropped out, and his rider
wisely allowed him to settle down. He
moved up fast at the turn, and put the
issue beyond doubt at the Leger. Auto-
pay won the same race three years ago,
and then took the Epsom, but his pros-
pects of a second victory in the latter
race are not bright.
Knight Hugh Denison, who is abroad,
won the Spring Handicap with Dark
Chief (12 to 1). The Dark Fox gelding
led throughout, and beat lolaus and Sat-
rnoth. lolaus met with bad luck in run-
ning ; Satmoth was disappointed when
going for a run on the rails at the turn.
He had to come round his field at the
Leger, and lost ground. He should pick
up a race at Randwick.

Carrying the colors of Desert Gold,
Senior (7 to 2) was too brilliant for Cele-
brate and Red Rufus in the Welter Mile.
Babili tried to go with him, but ran off
the course in the straight, and cut it'
badly from the Leger. Senior is a good
type of M.L. gelding by Chief Ruler.
Sydney sportsman S. A. Marden, who
owned Gwillian G, has a smart galloper
named Maelstrom. The Marconigram
colt, starting at 7 to 2, won the Three-
year-old from Mystic Spell and Var-
nottar. Constantine was favorite, and,
after giving an exhibition of buckjump-
ing and delaying the start, got away well
to lead until the straight. There he ran
off, and tried to find a hiding place.
Pastoralist Sage Bruce did the bookies
a good turn when the David colt Solo-
maro collected the third division of the
Maiden, at twelves, from Carmtop and
Persil. Bulldozer (2 to 1), a stable-mate
of Journal, annexed the first heat, and
Golden Moa, a half-brother to Sov, took
the second division, at 7 to 4.
“Down-the-line” courses in Melbourne
have each staged a Centenary Gold Cup
this month —Epsom on September 8 and
Mentone on Saturday. The stake to
the winner was only £250 and a trophy
valued at £lOO, but there is much in a
name, and turf followers tamely acqui-
esced in paying Is. more than usual for
admittance to the grandstand enclosure
and 3d. extra to the outer reserve. J. L.
Reilly founded the Mentone course 47
years ago. He operates it on a pro-
prietary basis in conjunction with Leslie
Stuart, who owned several notable
jumpers in years gone by.
The result of the Mentone Gold Cup
had little bearing on prospects at the
Caulfield and Flemington meetings.
L’Elite, the winner, started at 25 to 1.
In the autumn of 1933 he landed the
V.R.C. Sires’ Produce Stakes. At inter-
vals since then the son of Gay Lothario
showed flashes of brilliance, but gradu-
ally he came to be regarded as a sprinter,
and none too reliable in that role. How-
ever, Freedman, the trainer, never lost
faith in the chestnut. The handicappers
could not afford to take risks, and L’Elite
was allotted Bst. 61b. in the Caulfield
Cup. He carried Bst. 51b. on Saturday
and met Caulfield Cup rivals such as
Brave Boy, Picatus, Noel Soldat, Panto,
Taisho, Streperus and the imported mare
Gaterina on favorable terms.
Punters made Streperus a slightly
better favorite than Brave Boy. Holt de-
clared that both his candidates, Picatus
and Panto, would run well ; yet Picatus
figured at 8 to 1, and the black stallion
from Westralia at 20 to 1. The coat
of Panto shone like satin, and he looked
to be in beautiful condition. Holt was
astounded to see Panto whipping-in the
field ; Dempsey, the jockey, stated that
the W.A. Derby hero had refused to
gallop in earnest after receiving an early
check. Holt has rather a high opinion
of Panto, who may come to light before
long. L’Elite led practically all the way.
He gamely stalled off a challenge from
Ruling Light and scored by a neck.
Ruling Light is a stable companion of
Sir Simper, who holds an advanced
position in Caulfield Cup quotes.
W. T. Hazlett did not enter Ruling
Light for the big spring handicaps, so
it may be assumed that Sir Simper is
far superior.
Sjtreperus headed the unplaced divi-
sion, but did not impress. Picatus failed
after having had every chance. The time
for the race, 2min. ssec., was only a
quarter of a second slower than the
course record.
McShortodds had a royal time. In
nine events only two favorites won, and
such outsiders triumphed as Lady Burne-
wang (25 to 1), L’Elite (25 to 1), Jacasse
(15 to 1) and Bombados (12 to 1). A. G.
Hunter, her breeder, put only £1 (at 50
to 1) on Lady Burnewang for. the second
division of the Three-year-old Handicap.
This filly is in the same stable as Aztec,
whose owner, H. V. Creswick, has re-
turned from England.
The first division of the Three-year-old
Handicap went to Hyperion, trained by
Holt' and owned by W. H. Vincent, of
the W.A.T.C. committee. Hyperion was
a long way out of his ground, but came
home strongly to beat Quarto by a neck.
Quarto belongs to J. Spencer Brunton,
of Sydney, who paid a flying visit to
Melbourne to see her run. For a first-up
effort, Quarto did well.

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Scarf took out both boxing and wrest-
ling titles in the heavyweight division of
Ma’s amateur championships. In the
wrestling he beat Canning well by two
falls to one, but the boxing final de-
veloped into a slugging match. Scarf
had an advantage of 27 pounds over his
opponent, and seemed surprised at not
being able to knock his man out. Both
were pretty near all-in at the finish. The
best match of the evening was in the
lightweight division, won by H. Bennell
after a clever display of fast two-handed
fighting. Bantam J. Mace was the most
impressive of the others, beating Bowden
on a technical knock-out in the second
round. Other new titleholders are:
Wrestling: Bantam, Hansen, jun.; feather,
D. Starling; light, W. Clarke; welter,
J E. Murray; middle, J. R. Bromley.
Boxing: Feather, J. Moore; welter, G.
Black ; middle, W. Crome. Moore and
Inskip have been chosen for the Aus-
tralian team to tour Maoriland.

Sydney is getting too much wrestling.
There were many more seats than spec-
tators at Rushcutter Bay Stadium when
Tony Felice lost to Wong Bock Cheung
—after each had gained a fall, the
Italian, spreadeagled in the fourth round,
failed to respond when the bell rang for
the fifth. Moreover, thousands did not
require to be turned away (having stayed
away) when Lurich defeated Saveloff at
Leichhardt. Lurich could • apparently
have ended the infliction in the first
round. He let it drag on till the sixth.
Footbrawl
Victorian League’s first semi-final, be-
tween South Melbourne and Colling-
wood, enticed 52,022 to the M.C.
Ground, the “gate” amounting to £2605
Bs. Game was hard and tense, and the
finish wildly exciting, but there was little
attractive, systematic play. Too often
eagerness and congestion spoilt every-
thing. ’Wood went off with a spurt and
put 33 points to 9 on the board at the
first change; then South got into its
stride, and at half-time only 4 points
separated the pair. The Magpies, playing
concertedly and backing up effectively,
ran all over the Southerners, and added
10 wretched behinds in a row, when they
should have made the game theirs.. They
held on grimly in the last quarter till
almost on the bell, when South staged a
couple of swift drives that yielded two
goals and gave it the match by three
points—ll-12 (78) to 9-21 (75). The un-
certainty of ’Wood’s forwards in that
fierce third quarter lost the game, but
it wasn’t all their fault; the cleverness
and determination of South’s backs —
Hillis, McLaughlin and McKay—forced
them out of position into hasty shots.
These men, with Richards and Diggins,
were the best of the winners ; Regan,
Rumney, Whelan and Albert Collier
shone for ’Wood. Gordon Coventry
kicked five goals—and far too many be-
hinds —while Pratt raised his season’s
tally from 138 to 142.
* * * *
Australian Rules football ended as far
Sydney was concerned with a gruelling
final between South Sydney and New-
town at Erskineville. South won by
17-12 (114 points) to 12-6 (78 points).
The game was very willing, and the
Prince Alfred Hospital near by gained
several recruits as a result. This is South
Sydney’s first win since 1914.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: The Brownlow medal,
most coveted of Victorian football
rewards, which is awarded by a vote of
umpires to the best and fairest player,
went this year to the Essendon rover
Reynolds by one vote, Bunton, of Fitz-
roy, a winner in 1931-32, being second.
Reynolds’s score was 19, but the lowest
of the six candidates managed to raise 16.
* * H= *
“Stand Off”: Two eminent R.U.
footballers have announced their retire-
ment from the game after this season.
One is full-back Ross, who, beginning his
big-football career in 1925, has repre-
sented Australia ever since against M.L.
and in Britain with the Waratahs.
Appendicitis kept him out of all but
one Test in the South African tour
in 1933. In between the international
games he has figured for N.S.W.
against Queensland and Victoria for 10
years. Malcolm started a couple of
years later. The scrum-half, like his
cobber, is a Waratah-Wallaby rep., and
has toured M.L. in charge of an Austra-
lian team. Malcolm has captained a Ma
State side 18 times, and thus beats the
long-standing record of another famous
scrum-half, Fred Woods, by four.
* * * *
“Breakaway”: Minor Rugby Union
history was made in Tasmania when Uni-
versity played the Harlequins for the
premiership of the South. University
won by nine points to three. This is the
second year Rugby has been played in
Tasmania and the first in which it has
been organised.
“Ride Off”: Australian players
mourned a fine fellow and a great sports-
man when J. K. (“Knox”) Ross died in
Sydney the other day. One of three
brothers, he was a member of the Har-
den (N.S.W.) polo team which a few
years ago ruled the roost in Australian
polo. Originally playing at No. 1,
“J.K.” developed into a dangerous hard-
hitting No. 2. W. F. Ross, M.L.A. for
Cootamundra, is a brother.
* * * *
“Ride Off”.: The Australasian polo
tourney for the Gold Cup, which begins
at Melbourne early in November, will
see at least Queensland, N.S.W., Victoria
and South Australia competing. It is
likely that a second team will be raised
in N.S.W., and, of course, there will be
the M.L. players. Of the five crossing
the Tasman, Grigg, Johnston and Gould
were members of the team which won
the Saville Cup (the M.L. championship)
in 1928 and 1929. There will be no lack
of ponies, either, many other players hav-
ing offered to lend theirs.
* * * *
“Finger Spin”: I am beginning to
think that old bowlers have old soldiers
outclassed for refusal to lie down, when
they should be dead. Syd Barnes, at 61,
plays nowadays with the Keighley club
in the Yorkshire professional League.
Last week someone sent the writer a
cutting from London “Daily Express”
to say the old gentleman had taken 8
for 9 against Bradford club —and, re-
member, these professional clubs contain
many past and potential county players.
* * * *
The amateur section of the fifteenth
Goulburn-Sydney road race, run by Dun-
lops, was a triumph for the N.S.W. rider
Charles Winterbottom. The only scratch
man in a field of 183 riders, he covered
the 128 miles in shr. 23min. 24sec., only
54sec. behind professional Hubert Op-
perman’s record. The first to finish was
R. Conroy with a start of 43min. 30sec.
The best time in the professional section
was shr. 29min. 13 l-ssec., also off
scratch, by Victorian Harry Cruise.
Staples, of Goulburn, riding off the
55min. mark, was first over the line.
* * * 4=
The fourth race for the America’s
Cup off Long Island saw the contestants
equal with two races each —the first to
win four is the victor. In the first two
events there was plenty of wind, and this
suited the challenger to perfection, the
English boat romping home on each
occasion. The third was a typical L.I.
puff-and-drift affair, for which the de-
fenders are specially designed. The
fourth race had an unfortunate ending.
With a good breeze, the English had all
the best of it until near the finish of the
second leg ; then Rainbow took the lead,
and she never lost it, winning by lmin.
15sec. A protest was dismissed.

Under the Whip
The Bulletin chose Peter Pan to win
the Melbourne Cup on the appearance of
the weights. The chestnut is doing a
great preparation, and his victory at seven
furlongs in the w.f.a. Sir Herbert Mait-
land Stakes at Victoria Park was the
achievement of a high-class galloper.
And it was no fluke. Peter was
ridden expertly by Jim Munro, who
saved the chestnut for the last run and
timed it to the second ; in the result he
beat Chatham by a neck, with Duke
Caledon (last at the half-mile) three
lengths away. Chatham’s failure was a
blow to his party, as he showed no fight
when Pike, asked him the big question.
Australia Fair was not pressed to win
the first division of the V.P. Flying Han-
dicap with Bst. 41b. —seven pounds more
than his Epsom impost. He started at
7 to 4 on ; the opposition was so weak
that Custodian, who has been in the
vel.’s hands, was able to run second, and
Gold Digger a poor third.
Jack King has a strong hand in the
Metrop. with the favorite, Oro, and
little Miss Nottava. The latter was set
a severe task in the V.P. Handicap, but
after making all the running she hung
on too well for the favorite, Regal Son ;
Nord, third, finished strongly from the
Leger. Miss Nottava has 7st. 91b. in
the Metrop.

“Attendances at the Epsom and Metro-
politan meetings? I expect them to go
back to the old figures.” Thus G. T.
Rowe, secretary of the
A.J.C., to a Bulletin
man, and it won’t be
the club’s fault if they
don’t. In a series of
fine programmes, the
best of the N.S.W. gal-
lopers will tackle horses
from Victoria, Queens-
land and M.L.: a capi-
tal lot of three-year-
olds will measure
strides in the Derby;
some very good milers
will make Chatham
carry his lOst. 91b. in
the Epsom ; Peter Pan
will meet Rogilla in
th e weight - for - age
events, and an excep-
tionally good lot of
stayers will compete
for the Metropolitan.
Lastly, the youngsters
will sport silk for the
first time in the Breeders’ Plate and
Gimcrack Stakes.
The Epsom looks open. Whittingham
has done a thorough preparation: no
horse could have come through his trials
more satisfactorily. Australia Fair and
Care Free are dangerous opponents de-
spite their lack of size. Lough Neagh is
one that the distance won’t bother, and
Roman Spear is racing most consistently.
Chatham is a great horse, but this Page
doesn’t see him beating that lot at the
weights, and Whittingham is selected to
win.
Can Silver King go a mile and a half
and finish strong? If he can he should
win the Derby, but it is doubtful. Glads-
wood (Limond —Curtain) is bred to stay,
and is improving with every gallop. He
is owned by Mrs. Spencer Brunton, who
may have the pleasure of accepting the
blue riband. Silver King and Theo may
fill, the places.
The Spring Stakes should provide a
good tussle between Peter Pan and
Rogilla. Peter is now at the top of his
form, and he should turn the tables on
Rogilla, who beat him narrowly in the
Chelmsford Stakes and the King’s Cup.
The Metropolitan is as open as the
Epsom. In each case backers have been
taking prices which are certain to
lengthen on the day. Topical is a genuine
stayer, and is not badly handicapped at
Bst. 1 lib. His last two runs have been
disappointing,. but he likes a solid pace
all the way, and he will get it in the
Metrop. Oro and Braeburn are an in-
teresting pair, but Topical should account
for them.
Victorian two-year-olds are more for-
ward than the Sydney contingent. The
Moabite—Gold Tinge colt Aureas,
trained by Frank Musgrave for E. L.
Baillieu, is expected to win the Breeders’
Plate. For the Gimcrack Stakes, to be run
on Wednesday, there is nothing better
in sight than W. Kelso’s Drake filly
Robin.
Ins and Outs
The Board of Control has appointed Mr.
Bradman, of South Australia, one of the
three Australian selectors, which means
that he will be Australia’s future captain
in addition, vice Woodfull retired. E. A.
Dwyer (N.S.W.) and W. J. Johnson (Vic.)
retain their seats. The opening for Brad-
man came from the retirement of Dr.
Dolling. The committee’s first job will
be the selection of the team for South
Africa next year.
“Wot’s th’ big idea givin’ me out?”
“I thought y’d like to git back to the pavilion before th’ beer dried up.”
“The Barbadoes”: Determined to
take it out of somebody’s hide appar-
ently, the Marylebone C.C. is dispatching
a team to the West Indies. Wyatt is
skipper, and others we have heard of
are Fames and Farrimond, the latter
the second Lancashire ’keeper, but a
much better bat than Duckworth. Old
hands are Holmes —dropped this year
from the Yorkshire team —Hendren,
Hammond, Ames and Leyland.
* * * *
“Five Ways”: Queensland has been
hunting round for a cricket coach —
which, heaven knows, it needs badly.
An offer has been made to J. A. Christy,
the South African all-rounder, who was
here in 1931-32 with the Springboks.
Christy is a tall, lathy chap with a great
drive on either side of the wicket.
He topped the South African batting
averages in all matches in Australia with
39.52. In the Tests he had 23.5, and
scored three centuries. Queensland is
offering a guaranteed minimum of £4OO
a year, this including coaching and lec-
turing. Another £100 will be paid for
travelling expenses and a further £50 p.a.
if Christy makes two centuries in any
Shield season. It sounds very pretty,
but the Q.C.A. is a cantankerous con-
cern. Memories are fresh of how it
quarrelled with its skipper as far off as
Adelaide because he wouldn’t play its
selection, made in Brisbane that morning.
* * * *
“Lancaster Park”: Maoriland is to
have a visit from a Marylebone team in
1935-36. The Shivery Islanders were
hopeful of getting an eleven from Aus-
tralia next season, but that was impossible.
Apart from the neglected Sheffield series,
we have to ship a side to South Africa
next September. Even the suggestion
that a visit from a State team would do
had to be turned down for the same
reasons. The last M.C.C. side to go to
M.L., after a preliminary trip through
Australia, was Arthur Gilligan’s in 1929-
30.
* * * *
“Holy City”: Bert Ironmonger, one
of the best left-hand bowlers Australia has
produced, drops out of all but club cricket
this year unless he should be invited to
play in the Ponsford-Woodfull benefit.
Bert played his first cricket in Ipswich
(Q.), and appeared regularly for the
.State in the matches against N.S.W. and
visiting teams before Bananaland came
into the Sheffield ring. He then tried
his luck in Victoria for a bit, but returned
to Sydney, where he played for Balmain
club. He got back to Victoria again,
by which time his talents were very
belatedly recognised. He is certainly the
worst fieldsman the game has seen, but
occasionally has performed miracles in
the way of catches, as Larwood will
admit.
* * * *
“Molly”: The success of Fleetwood-
Smith in England has moved a lot of
wiseacres to declare him the greatest
left-hand bowler Victoria has produced
since Jack Saunders. After the fact
that both propelled the ball with the left
hand the comparison ceases. F.-S. is a
left-hand googly freak ; Saunders was a
legitimate spin left-hander. Where the
pair do come together is in their vile
batting. Saunders was a simple-minded
fellow, and, queerly enough, considered
himself a badly-neglected batsman. When
the 1902 Eleven was returning to Australia
Trumper, Hill and Noble, who had scored
far over 1000 runs apiece, were growling
at the inferior quality of their bats,
dozens of which had been broken.
Saunders went away and presently came
back with a bat in a green baize cover.
“How the do you fellers break so
many bats?” he said. “Look at mine,
it ain’t got a flamin’ mark on it!”
* * * *
“Aigburth”: With the Australian
Eleven shaping up for home, the
usual tale of leading players being
“approached” to return to England after
the contractual two years is up is being
circulated. Grimmett is wanted by Julien
Cahn, a wealthy and hospitable Jew who
is devoted to cricket. Cahn has filled the
place of Lord Hawke and Plum Warner,
who used to take mixed teams —not too
strong—of amateur and professional
players to all sorts of places abroad.
Grimmett will be 50 by the time he is
able to copper Cahn’s bet, and it looks
as if Julien is one of these optimists.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Carnoustie”: In a long experience,
writer has never seen anything more
asinine than the so-called arrangements
made by the Australian golf authorities
for the dozens of visiting golfers, ama-
teur and professional, whom they have
invited to the Melbourne centenary. The
amateurs are a case in point. They
start in Westralia on October 16 and
then cross the continent to Queensland
—rotten management! After playing
some sort of a game there on October
22, Scott and his men are to play Aus-
tralia at Sydney, after that engaging Ma.
Arguments about finance are flying so
thickly between Ma and Melbourne that
it is a bit doubtful whether these games
will come off. Then, after a long run in
the centenary championships at Mel-
bourne, the team finishes up its tour at
Launceston, Hobart and Adelaide before
breaking for home. The arrangements
for the various professional teams seem
just as much jumbled. Unless Lady Luck
has a fair spin, there is going to be a
record tangle.
* * * *
“Canny Lad”: Victoria, which, after
years of cost and trouble, has at last in-
duced a team of amateur golfers from
Britain to come to Australia, asked
N.S.W. to pay half the guarantee of
£l2OO. Ma has gone sour. The visitors
will spend more time in Victoria than
they will in N.S.W.—which is a fair
thing, since they have to take part in the
elaborate centenary golf tourney. That’s
enough. Ma won’t pay because she sees
no chance of getting £6OO back from the
gates. The Victorian money was raised
out of the pockets of supporters of the
game without reference to gates.
% % :f:
“Brassey”: What promises to be one
of the most sensational golf games ever
seen in Australia will be played on
Manly links on October 10 over 18 holes
of match. Sarazen and Kirkwood will
meet Jim Ferrier and Hattersley, and it
will be mighty interesting to see how the
youngster shapes up against the formid-
able opposition—it will be his first game
against accredited overseas champions.
In all the big golf Ferrier has played
in Australia he has shown that it takes
a lot to ruffle him. I doubt even if
Sarazen’s reputation will shake him.
Hattersley’s tremendous if sometimes
erratic hitting should be a help in
this foursomes match, though, if writer
had been consulted, he would have
chosen a steadier player and left the
fireworks to the youngster. When
Hagen and Kirkwood were here some
years ago they played L. B. Wines and
Hattersley, a not very hot combination,
and won 3 and 2. The American pair

"Hoylake”: Nancy Jupp, who played
extraordinary golf to win the English
girls’ championship, has delivered an
opinion on the press which princes would
not dare to voice, whatever they may
think in their secret hearts. Besieged
by the usual gang of press photographers
and scribes after her win, she stamped
her foot and cried “I don’t want to see
another reporter or photographer as long
as I live. I hate the sight of them.”
And only 13! It recalls the verse tag to
Kipling’s story “Tod’s Amendment”:
God’s benison upon the young,
God’s blessing on the baby tongue
That fears not anything.
* * * #
“Habitant”: Girls who wish to be-
come golf caddies on Quebec (Can.) golf
courses needn’t hang around in future.
The good fathers who rule in the last
dominion of Louis XIV. have long ob-
jected to girl caddies. In a recent case
before the Courts, Judge Robilliard has
described the employment of female
caddies as ‘‘immoral,” so that’s that.
* * # *
“Divot Digger”: When the R.S.G.C.,
which is running this year’s Australian
championships at Rose Bay, opened the
entries there was some fear that there
would be no Vies. However, two of the
best in Whitton and Williams are certain-
ties, and Hope, last year’s amateur cham-
pion, dropped the Victorian amateur
championship to get time to play in the
national event. A bunch of Victorian
and South Australian pros, is coming
along, and Queensland has an entry of
eight of its best professionals—the biggest
from the State for years. Among the
South Australians will be Fergus Mc-
Mahon, who has again won the profes-
sional title of his State. Another star
is young O. Walker, of Queensland, who
lifted the pro. championship from all
the old heads last week.
* * t- r-
“Oaklands”: Mick Ryan, Australian
and Victorian amateur champion on
several occasions, has bad luck with his
clubs. In 1931 he had a full set stolen
from Kingston Heath verandah just be-
fore the Victorian amateur champion-
ship. He had to play with a borrowed
set, and was beaten by Harry Williams.
The other day he put in the club rack
three specially made woods which he in-
tended to use in the Australian cham-
pionships in Sydney. They disappeared.
Ryan is advertising for his clubs under
the impression that they were “taken in
mistake” —three specially built new
woods, mark you. He is an optimist.
* * =N
“Troon”: Interesting to read that
Lawson Little, who has just added the
American amateur golf title to his
British championship, has declined to
visit Australia. Little was a witness,
during the British amateur championship,
of the extraordinary demonstration made
by Glasgow roughs against Jock
McLean when his opponent was an
artisan. The chronicles tell how Little
collected the cup and fled back to
America with it that same evening. Pos-
sibly he thinks Australians would behave
like the Glasgow mob.
Racquet and Bawl
“Milton”: Queensland tennis has
emerged from a brawl. For some time
the Q.L.T.A. and the Summer Associa-
tion have been at loggerheads. The
S.A. entered into an agreement which
involved financial help from a big south-
ern tennis-goods firm; “Professional-
ism,” said the Q.L.T.A., and it threw out
the S.A. The S.A. retaliated with threats
of legal action for damages, and the
State authorities abjectly backed down.
* * * *
“Bournemouth”: European tennis
authorities are reviving the move to
substitute three-set matches in cham-
pionship and Davis Cup games for the
five-set convention which has ruled so
long. Most of the first-class players are
in favor of the change, and there is a
lot to be said for it. Tennis is played
at a much faster pace and on faster
courts than it was when the All England
championships were instituted in 1877,
and even when the Davis Cup games
began 34 years ago. Besides that, to ask
visitors from Europe to play in an
Australian summer the same length of
game that they were content with in cool
Europe is sheer murder.
* * * *
“Rockferry”: A lot of changes in the
rules of tennis are forecast if some of the
innovations now being suggested in
Britain are adopted. One is that the
six-game sets should be abolished in
favor of 10, the advantage rule compelling
a player to win two consecutive games
before taking a set being retained. With
10-game sets only three would be played.
The general feeling is that five fought-out
sets of six games are too long. On the
other hand, the change-over to three sets
of six games allows too much opening for
a snap win. Three-set rubbers with 10
games to a set should give the players
a first-class chance to show their stamina
and stroke play without much chance of
the better players being fluked out.
Miscellaneous
“Swan”: London R.C., on its way to
Henley-on-Yarra, made a safe landfall
at Fremantle last week and had a prac-
tice row on the Swan. The crew is
under the management of the club cap-
tain, E. Howitt, who rows No. 5. Two
Victorians are in the boat, both Cam-
bridge blues. They are W. A. Sambell,
of Pembroke, who was three years in the
Light Blue eight, and D. J. Wilson, who
was in the Leander crew which this year
won the Grand Challenge Cup. D. S.
Gogarty is coach. According to the
skipper, the crew averages 12st. 21b. and
24 years. Interesting is his comment
That the old body-swing fetish is vanish-
ing from English rowing, the leg drive
off the stretcher and the arm pull-through
being now all-important. Howitt says
that "the style is a modified Fairbairn.
and those clubs which have been trying
that style in Australia should get some
tips out of the visitors. The stroke, T.
Turner, is regarded as the best produced
in England since the war.
* * * *
“Stretcher”: The Nepean (N.S.W.)
R.C., the only country club in the Ma
State, is sending three entries to Henley-
on-Yarra, a maiden four, a junior four
and a sculler. Each lad ought to sport
a placard to this effect: “Though
South Australia, Victoria and Queens-
land support dozens of country rowing
clubs among them, we are the only
country rowing club in N.S.W., and this
in spite of the fact that the State is full
of fine rivers. Rowing, like all other
major sports, is regarded in N.S.W. as
being purely the privilege of a small
metropolitan coterie, and nothing else
gets a look in.”
# Sc c[c *
“Toowong”: It looks as if the
Henley-on-Yarra folk will have to get
their creek widened for the regatta. Offi-
cial crews from all the Australian States
and M.L. have been nominated, not for-
getting the Englishmen. Now, two more
Queensland crews are asking permission
to take part. Both are fours, one from
Rockhampton and the other from a
Brisbane club.
* * * *
“Blade Sight”: The N.S.W. riflemen
are making a big splash over their annual
meeting at Anzac, near Liverpool, this
year, which will run from October 6 to
13. It is the 70th meeting of its kind,
and 33 matches will be shot over dis-
tances from 300 to 900 yards. Riflemen
are coming from M.L. and from all over
the Commonwealth, especially Victoria,
which always sends a powerful contin-
gent. There is £5112 for prizes. The
King’s has been allotted £845 of this,
£lOO being the winner’s end. The other
star turn will be the Prince Henry aggre-
gate, and here there will be £586 prize-
money, of which the winner takes £5O.
jjc i|c -l* *!'
“Centre”: The news that a M.L.
rifle team is coming across for the' big
N.S.W. King’s Prize meeting at Anzac
range should make most of us shake at
the knees if the All-Blacks are all like
Captain Masefield, of Wellington. Shoot-
ing at Blenheim butts at 300, 500, 600
and 900 yards he scored a bull’s-eye with
each of his 28 shots. W. H. West, who
was shooting with him, only dropped a
point at each range.

No Easy Way Out
As was here suggested, Douglas Credit
candidates polled rather well at the Com-
monwealth elections. People are asking
why, when the A + B theorem and other
Douglas notions are so patently absurd.
A great many of the Major’s supporters
don’t understand the mechanics of ffiis
depression remedy. They are, however,
aware that something is wrong with
a world which needs our wool and can’t
buy it; that something is amiss in an
undeveloped country with a heavy un-
employed list. Douglas capitalises this
topsy-turviness in our business life and
offers a “remedy.” His is the only well-
organised financial-“reform” society;
hence the support.
The gold standard as we know it is
little more than 150 years old. It grew
up of itself, out of necessity, its Suc-
cessful operation depended a great deal
upon chance —upon low commodity
prices bringing forth a greater produc-
tion of the metal, or on high merchan-
dise and wages costs discouraging min-
ing. Gold-mining has been too chancy
and fickle a game to maintain this bal-
ance properly.
But the gold standard can’t be blamed
for most of our troubles. Finance is
merely a handmaiden to trade, and the
world crisis is largely a commercial one.
Certainly the gold standard
has failed to govern com-
nierce sufficiently to prevent
violent fluctuations in prices
and other abuses. World
commerce seems to have
grown too big and too com-
plicated to be easily managed
by old methods of controlling
credit and prices.
But a point which many
critics of the gold standard
seem to forget is that no-
body begins to worry about the metal
until trade and financial conditions be-
come unhealthy. We find countries
pressing goods upon other countries
often beyond the means of the buyers;
then, when the buyers begin to realise,
through a depreciated exchange and
adverse trade balance, that fewer im-
ported goods must be used if external
debts are to be honored, the sellers raise
a howl against emergency tariffs.
This is just one example of the strains
imposed on world financial relations.
Until these get out of balance nobody
worries abopt gold ; each country gets
along all right on its own credit. Once
the damage has been done by unwise
trade and business methods—or by war —
there is no easy way out. It is a case
of plain living and hard work, as with an
embarrassed firm or business. Many
nations have been forced to devalue their
currencies in order to regain external
trade. This is not a remedy ; it is merely
a palliative, and a nightmare to the
trader.
A “Bulletin” Article in Court
In its issue of July 18 The Bulletin
reviewed the prospectus of GKP-Pro-
jection (Aust.), Ltd., and gave particu-
lars of previous activities of one of its
directors —Percy Freeman, late of the
Mercantile Bank (in liquidation). The
other day the Crown Law Department at
Brisbane produced this criticism in court.
E. O. Litchfield, described as pro-
prietor of the “Federal Security C 0.,”
Queensland representative of GKP, was
fined £lO on each of two charges;
namely, that he had knowingly issued a
prospectus of which a copy had not been
filed with the Registrar, and that he had
issued an application form for shares,
the prospectus not complying with the
Queensland Companies Act of 1931.
The Bulletin article cited recalled,
amongst other things, that in 1926
Freeman had promoted Motor and Cash
Orders, taking the job of managing-
director at £2OOO a year and 10 p.c.
commission on sale of scrip. The Mer-
cantile Bank fiasco was also described.
It was stated in court that Litchfield
was “authorised” by Percy Freeman.
Litchfield was sole representative of the
co. in Brisbane. The Bulletin pointed
out that, though GKP was registered
under the ancient N. S. Wales Companies
Act, the main assault on the investment
market appeared to have been made in
Brisbane. Persons desiring information
as to contracts, etc., were referred to the
co.’s solicitor —in Sydney.
Australian Economy
Unemployment throughout Australia
dropped from 25.7 p.c. for the second
quarter of 1933 to 20.9 p.c. at June 30,
1934. So says the Commonwealth Bank
Board in its last report. At the darkest
stage of our difficulties —June, 1932 —the
figure was 30 p.c.
A marked increase in building, manu-
facturing and mining is reported. Retail
sales in the cities where records are kept
are also up, with notable increases in
recent months. These desirable trends
are attributed to higher • wool, mutton
and lamb prices ; during the term cov-
ered by the board’s report, wheat, butter
and sugar continued low in price. The
price of wool, Australian currency, was
higher in January than at any time since
May, 1928.
The fall in value since and the weak-
ness of overseas markets were soon re-
“A re you going to take me to Melbourne for the centenary, clad?”
“Can’t afford it, dear; but I’ll take you to the next.”
fleeted in industrial shares. N. S. Wales
share-price index, from the gloomy 484
of September, 1931, moved up to 901 in

883, and there has been a further decline.

With wool as it is, nothing so good can
be looked for during the current term.
The area under wheat dropped from
15,765,000 acres in 1932-33 to 14,966,000
acres in ’33-34. Partly owing to the
false dawn as far as wool was con-
cerned, much wheat acreage has since
been turned over to sheep. At June 30
there was something like 67,000,000
bushels of a carryover. After a hearten-
ing rise a month or so ago, the local
market for wheat has weakened to 2s.
lOd. a bushel.
Shake It Up, Mr. Stevens!
N. S. Wales Government proposes to
bring in anti-share-hawking legislation,
similar to that recently introduced in
Victoria. Queensland has such an Act,
and so has Britain.
The main amendments to the Com-
panies Act are to be “deferred”—as
usual. Share-hawking and specious pros-
pectuses, the two evils now to be dealt
with, urgently demand attention; but
there are other aspects of company law
almost as bad. The disclosure of subsi-
diary interests’ figures by holding cos.
should be made compulsory ; the infor-
mation should be demanded in the form
of individual or aggregate balance sheets.
There are examples in Sydney —with-
out bringing the “trust” cos. now being
examined into the case —where shares in
groups of interlocking cos. have been
dealt in by directors —buying in one
co. to sell to another. Permission of this
sort of thing leaves glaring loopholes for
hanky-panky. There should be clauses in
company law to compel directors selling
anything,'whether shares or other assets,
to disclose the nature of the transaction
to the co. at general meeting, the deal to
be invalid unless sanctioned by share-
holders. These conditions should be
made to extend to the director of any
co. related to the buying concern, even
though he may not actually be a director
of the latter.
Details of contracts of sale by ven-
dors should be made compulsory in
prospectuses of new cos. ; the ri"ht to
inspect documents at someone’s office is
not enough. All agreements entered into
by the promoter or directors as regards
employment should be summarised. And
if people must invest in “bonds” let them
be covered at once by adequate legisla-
tion.
Grain Supplies in U.S.A.
“Learning”: U.S.A. Agricultural De-
partment figures give more than a ray of
hope for Australian wheatgrowers. Stock
and wheat surpluses have dwindled, and
production for 1934 is forecast at
483,000,000 bushels, against the aver-
age of 886,359,000 bushels during
the five years ended 1931. Against
this five-year period, the year’s spring
wheat will be about one-third of
normal, the acreage to be harvested in
the 1934 season being half the usual. This
is due primarily to “extreme droughts in
the Dakotas and adjacent areas.” The
July 1 “condition” of spring wheat is the
worst on record—3B.l p.c., against the
previous lowest figure of 52.1 p.c. in
June last year. The seriousness of the
position is accentuated by prospective
shortages of other grains.
The oats acreage is the lowest since
1905, and the yield at 17 bushels is six
bushels less than in any year of the past
44. Maize is below average yield stand-
ard ; there will be less rye than in any
season for 22 years, and the rice crop
will be slightly shorter than has been
known since 1925.
In some American States the supply
of farm labor shows a 176 p.c. surplus
of hands, and the average excess for the
whole republic is 51 p.c., while wages
per month (with board) are about half
vvhat they were in 1927 despite revalua-
tion of currency.
Prices at the first series of Melbourne
wool sales were more than 20 p.c. below
the corresponding rates of last year and
5 p.c. to 10 p.c. weaker than the figures
ruling at the opening series in Brisbane
this season. Crossbred wools, even of
good quality, are hard to move ; merinos
have kept their price best. At the open-
ing London sales prices over the whole
range declined 5 p.c. to 15 p.c. compared
with July.

Sydney is having an orgy of cheap
taxi rides —an unusual thing for the
Bridge City. But long-distance fares are
shunned ; the shilling flag-fall and six-
pence a mile rate is conceded only on
short trips. Of 1015 taxis in the city, 800
are operating at the cut rates, though
during peak hours some return to the
shilling-a-mile charge. In Melbourne
prices have been fixed at Is. 6d. flag-fall
and Is. 6d. a mile—far too dear.

The Compagnie Generale Transatlan-
tique, for which the new 79,000-ton liner
Normandie is being built, has floated a
Joan of about £1,600,000 to cover con-
struction costs. The French Government
guarantees interest, and is to provide an
annual subsidy in respect of the vessel,
for which it will receive certain services
in return.

“S.T.S.”: The big Colonial Mutual
building going up in Adelaide gives to
that city its first sight of the synthetic
stone, “Benedict,” made in Brisbane from
crushed porphyry bound with stained
cement. It was used for the base walls
of Brisbane R.C. cathedral; the Col.
Mut. Society has introduced it also to
Wellington (M.L.) and Durban.

Following a similar experience in
Maoriland, the public issue of shares in
Canada’s new central bank has been
heavily oversubscribed. Maximum allot-
ment to individuals had to be cut down
to 50 shares.
Vic. Country party is after a further
statutory cut in mortgage interest rates.
Financial Emergency Act No. 3 specified
a reduction of 22£ p.c., with a minimum
of 5 p.c. ; the U.C.P. thinks that 4 p.c.
would be more in keeping with present
interest charges generally. U.A.P. Minis-
ters reckon 44- p.c. would be fairer.

Natural Gas and Oil Corp., boring for
natural gas and oil from the bottom of
the old Balmain (Sydney) colliery shaft,
opened up the sealed bore the other day
and reports that “gas came out very
freely, and burned with a bright blue
luminous flame.” The gas has to work
through 500 ft. to 700 ft. of slurry in the
bore, which is 3966 ft. below Sydney. The
gas is said to burn with a strong petroli-
ferous smell.
Before the U.S. Senate Munitions
Committee it was testified that the capi-
tal of Pratt and Whitney Motor Co. had
expanded from £2OO to £2,300,000 in the
eight years to 1932, mainly as a result of
its sales of aeroplane engines to U.S. and
foreign Governments. Exports to Ger-
many had risen threefold since the rise
of Hitler.
Germany is not discouraged by Lan-
cashire’s rejection of the commodity-pay-
ment proposal. The Vaterland intends to
place its orders for raw materials with
countries willing to take German manu-
factures in barter. As a consumer of
other countries’ manufactured goods
Germany will apparently fade out of the
picture.

“Rich. J.”: Mention recently of the
durability of Australian timbers recalls
the peculiarity of some when taken from
their native element. Cypress pine used
as fence-posts away from the region in
which it is grown will only withstand
white-ants for a couple of years. In its
native soil it will last indefinitely. I
knew of a pine fence in western N.S.W.
which stood for over 25 years. When
it was removed to make way for an irri-
gation canal, the post-bottoms were as
sound as ever.

that he was, in his non-artistic moments,
to a considerable degree that sort of
person. As far as is known, he was an
inarticulate individual, rather fat. He fell
head over ears in love with a princess
who would have nothing to do with him,
and after that wrote glorious music in
such obscurity and with such complete
absorption that it was not until after
he died at 31 that the world woke up
to the fact that he was a compeer of
Beethoven and rummaged in his leavings
to find over 500 unpublished and lovely
sublimations of his exotic yearnings. The
British producers have done their roman-
tic job to the nth degree of efficiency,
and if the screen fairies have placed
Schubert in some ridiculous situations
Tauber rescues him from them by the
dignity with which he invests the char-
acter. Mae Baxter, Carl Esmond,

but they don’t matter.
“Freedom of the Seas”

background for this British film as in

venient peg on which to hang some art-
less fooling.
As a male Cinderella, Clifford Mol-

which is cluttered up with German
conspirators intent on handing the

O’Neal, an American vaudeville hoofer,
overhears the Morse signal call and
makes a noo dance out of it. She then
hastens to the bridge to show off her
artistic discovery to the commander. He

cumvents the Teuton villain. The prize is

Sundry Shows.
After appearing all over the continent
for two years amidst scenes of unex-
ampled enthusiasm, not to say hysteria,
Philip Hargrave, the boy pianist of Adel-
aide, returned to Melbourne Town Hall
on Saturday night, a better musician and
completely unspoiled in character, as far
as one could discern from a front-row
seat. This is a tremendous tribute to the
virtues of right education, for the boy
has obviously been set in the proper
direction so completely that you could
bury him in roses and adulation without
his turning an artistic hair. He is too
engaged in the absorbing occupation of
storing power inside hitnself to bother
about the secondary power he wields
over the outside audience of fellow-
humans. It is the bad artists whose work
has turned into a routine who seek the
latter form of power, weep when they
can’t get it and creep down the artistic
ladder in quest of it. The applause on
Saturday night was a tribute to amazing
juvenile talent rather than to the actual
transcendent merit of the playing. It is
asserted that Master Philip plays like an
adult. He does nothing of the sort. He
has several characteristics which would
surprise us in a grown-up virtuoso —his
habit of starting off abruptly on an item
as if he were repeating a lesson, of charg-
ing from one movement of a sonata into
another rather in the manner of an in-
strument that has been wound up and
set going, of appearing to say “That’s
where that comes in!” when he crashes
out a chord with his surprisingly
powerful fingers, of mechanising the
rhythms of his pieces somewhat. These
are all the characteristics we observe in
juvenile elocutionists at school break-ups,
but there is the difference that Philip has
an enormously greater capacity, a natural
talent, a control that is already remark-
able, a set purpose and habits of indus-
try, possibly also genius, which, if it is
planted in the right soil, may flower into
a great composer, as the infant Mozart
did ; if not it is rather a shuddersome
thought that he may be bowing to the
rapturous applause of our grandchildren
40 years hence for his 100,937 th per-
formance of the “Liebestraum.” In the
meantime, his playing of Beethoven’s
mislabelled “Pathetique” sonata was out-
standing in the andante cantabile section
and of quite remarkable volume in the
rondo. The two Bach items lacked the
delicacy and finish of the Chopin panel,
but were probably more exacting tech-
nically. J. Alexander Browne, as make-
weight, brought a very fine voice to bear
on some very coarse music. The season
removed to the King’s Theatre on Tues-
day ; there will be another concert on
Thursday and a fourth on Saturday.

The Sisserman Quartet made music
at the Wentworth, Melbourne, again last
week for an audience that ought to have
been larger. With Henri Penn at the
piano it negotiated Dvorak’s piano quin-
tet, Op. 81, with uncommon vigor.
Swarming rhythms, harsh contrasts and
unexpected passages of tenderness,
especially in the piano section, compen-
sated for not a little commonplaceness
which, in places, used idioms not de-
spised by the Salvation Army. Beethoven
used richer colors and deeper tones in
the quartet, Op. 127, which followed,
and which was sensitively played by Sis-
serman, Mischa Kogan, Frank Thorn
and Phillip Cohen (violinist), although
the last-named had dislocated an elbow
a few days previously. The short, brisk,
neat and clean sonata for solo viola and
piano of Handel, played by Kogan and
Penn, wound up the proceedings.

Theophilus Roberts, who treats stam-
merers, mouth-breathers and other suf-
ferers in the process of producing singers,
sat at the Melbourne Assembly piano two
nights last week as accompanist to Rene
Bartley’s recital of sundry modern poets.
The verse-makers selected included
Walter de la Mare, Alfred Noyes, A. A.
Milne, Padriac Colum and Myra Morris,
and most of the items were too short to
test the elocutionist’s capacity to re-create
an emotion. A certain monotony in the
delivery was made more apparent by the
musical setting, which obviously de-
manded singing instead of recitation. It
was the pleasantest part of the per-
formance.

The Sydney “Sun” and “Telegraph”
sponsored an operatic recital at the Con.
Hall on Saturday night, the solo perform-
ers being the winners of prizes presented
by those newspapers at the last Eistedd-
fod—Ruth Scott, Merle Ambler, Robert
Nicholson and David Barwell. Miss
Scott, in especial, made a very good im-
pression. Her pleasant, rather light voice
is backed by a gift of humor and a nice
stage manner.

Sydney’s next stage show is to be “Six-
teen,” which will replace “The Sacred
Flame” on the Cri. stage on Saturday.
At Thring’s New Tiv. “Mother of Pearl”
will introduce Delysia on Oct. 13, replac-
ing “The Beloved Vagabond.” At the
Royal “Blue Mountain Melody” is run-
ning strongly. A much-needed revision
is being undertaken, which should give
the show polish it lacked on the first
presentation.
The Palette,
Having to judge the 16th annual ex-
hibition of the Twenty (now 27) Mel-
bourne Painters at the Athenteum places
the conscientious critic in a quandary.
The sporting writer’s job is nothing to it.
Charged with the important task of
selecting the Melbourne Cup winner, he
looks at the horses and decides which
one, other things being equal, can run
the fastest. He doesn’t have to con-
sider whether it can jump fences or drag
a load of wool better than all the others
or do the journey on its hind legs. But
this is what the c/itic at the Athenaeum
is faced with. In short, few of the
starters in this notable event have the
same criterion or a definite objective;
some of them are scampering over the
countryside, others are stuck in the mud
and more are hastening backwards. For
instance, W. Frater obviously had some
object before him when he started paint-
ing “Nude” and “Barbara,” but the re-
sults aren’t in the least like anything in
nature ; they look more like explosions
in a paintshop. Shore, his colleague, car-
ries the disintegration of form still
further. Isabel Tweddle’s “Sofia” is a
good likeness, and W. Rowell’s “Miss
Modern” is a good-looking person, but
her artistic mother was Grandma Royal
Academy. Margery Withers’s girl who
is emerging from the tent in No. 124 has
nothing between her and nudity but
sundry academic conventions of draw-
ing. E. Kimpton has conveyed the
sombreness of evening very well in “The
Big Tree,” and in “Man with a Trident”
has some effective flesh tints posed
against a background of stage scenery.
E. Buckmaster gives Nature another sock
in the eye with an extensive view of
Olinda, for which Rupert Bunny makes
amends with some delicate and sensitive
landscapes, which, however, err on the
side of timidity. P. Hurry’s “Alma” is
somewhat' jumpy, but her girl called
“East and West” has the quality of real
light in it. Clarice Beckett sticks to her
simplicities and nails light down securely
by the faithful rendering of tonal values.
The also-rans are more numerous than
ever. There is plenty of variety in the
show, and variety is supposed to be the
spice of life, but this critic’s impression
is that much of the variety of the
Twenty-seven Painters is the wrong sort.
We don’t crave for nails in our curry.


NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
The Poor Sideshow
“Hugh G.”: There wy/s a time when
Queensland was the sideshowman’s para-
dise (B. 22/8/’34), but it is doubtful
whether there were any prayers of
thanksgiving offered this year after the
Brisbane Exhibition. For the sideshow-
man, Toowoomba was most successful
Queensland show —all of the agricultural
displays on the far northern itinerary
drew record crowds, but they were fail-
ures to the tent men.
In days gone by Queensland authori-
ties were inclined to overlook little
breaches of the Gaming Act; but the
police were as thick as flies this year
about the “bucket stands” at Bowen Park,
and a lady who gave a public display of
her terpsichorean prowess (and bits of her
anatomy) was fined £3. There are other
factors which have served to knock the
gilt off the gingerbread. Whereas wages
have dropped considerably, show
societies are still demanding ground rents
on a 1928 basis. At Brisbane one man
had to pay £lO2 fees for the week, plus
electric light and insurance costs. He
didn’t recover his capital outlay. An-
other thing which makes things hard is
the number of night “carnivals” operat-
ing permanently to raise
charitable or political funds.
Almost every vacant allot-
ment in Brisbane sports its
“fair” or “bingo” pitch, with
the result that when the show
comes to town the people
regard the sideshows—which
were once an annual treat—
as commonplace.
“ Kulgera ” : My south
boundary is the border-line
between South Aus. and the
N.T. A neighbor in S.A.,
only 30 miles away, has had
his rent reduced to 6d. per
sq. mile for the first five
years. For the next three
years he pays 9d. per sq.
mile, and for the remainder
of his lease only Is. 6d. per
sq. mile. Canberra says that T
must still continue to pay 2s.
6d. per sq. mile (or try to)
and give my abo. employees
10s. per week, in addition to
the cost of 10s. for a license
to work them and £2 Bs.
medical fee. Our neighbors
in South Aus. are not even
compelled to hold a license,
although in some cases more
abos. may be employed on a
run than in the N.T. And
they’ll tell you that they are
doing their best to open up
Australia’s vast unoccupied
spaces!
“Pandanus”: South Sea Islanders were
called Kanakas long before Bobby
Towns used the term in the old Queens-
land blackbirding days (B. 12/9/’34).
The word is derived from the French
“Canaque,” and was first applied by the
French colonists to the New Caledonians.
* * * *
“O. I. Saye”: Those glass balls which
have been seen on the North Queensland
coast need not necessarily have come
from the Coogee shark-net. Steam
trawlers operating on the east coast have
glass balls on their seine nets, and doubt-
less this is the source of the balls seen.
Pressure of water is so great at the depth
at which the net is dragged along the
bottom that corks would be waterlogged
and useless. For this reason hollow balls
of strong glass are attached to the upper
edge of the nets.
* * * *
Two candidates—both Communists —
came before the Courts during the elec-
tion campaign. The Senate aspirant was
fined at Blackall (C.Q.) for speaking in
the streets without a permit. His mate,
Slater, who was trying to oust Darby
Riordan from Kennedy (Q.), was
charged at Clermont with “speaking
without a permit, resisting arrest and
refusing to give his name.” After he
had been remanded, the State Cabinet
discussed him and the Home Secretary
said: “While I don’t think any great
wrong has been done, I have instructed
the police to take no further action.”
Curious how these minor cases some-
times become Cabinet matters, even when
they are before a magistrate who might
be considered competent to decide them.
* * * *
“Lugger’s Mate”: Whales (B. 12/9/’34)
are common visitors to tropical Queens-
land. Even as far north as 16deg. south
1 have seen a school of four gambolling
about the edge of the reef, and once two
came close enough to our flattie (out
from Michaelmas) to make our hearts
become as water. Although they were
babies, the flukes of one, which rose
lazily above water as they rolled past,
were capable of lifting our boat over the
reef into the Pacific.
* * * *
“T.T.4”: Since the Land Board took
over forestry in Queensland there have
been great changes in policy, and with
the first decent logging season for two
years (the past ones have been wet)
timber is flooding the railway stations.
During last month 2,000,000 super, feet
was dealt with officially in Brisbane
alone, and this did not include purchases
from the Crown at stump. Around
Atherton, no plant capable of hauling a
log is idle, and it is almost like the pre-
war days, when northern ash and other
“Who you think win air race, Jacky?”
“Smiffy, mine tinkit. Him here already.”
woods were being cut out to deck Ger-
man battleships. A good deal of re-
afforestation work is being done —about
300 men are employed on it; but there
should be 3000.
* * * *
“Endeavour”: Old-timers will heave
a sigh of regret to know that Cook-
town’s income consists now mostly of
old-age pensions. Once it was one of
the richest and most prosperous towns
in Queensland. The gold of its back
country was counted in tons, and
money circulated like water. To-day
houses may be rented for two bob a
week, and even former banks can only
raise ss. provided a tenant can be dis-
covered. A small timber industry holds
the people at present.
* * * *
“Hallo”: “Isnik Geul” (B. 19/9/’34)
wonders how the word “coo-ee” origi-
nated. Before the white men came it was
used extensively by the abos. In 1789
Captain Hunter mentioned in his report
of Hawkesbury River exploration that
he often heard them calling “Coo-wee”
as he spelt it, which he discovered meant
“Come here.” Ensign Barrallier in 1802
mentioned that he heard the natives call-
ing “Cooy” in the bush near Camden.
The early white settlers soon adopted the
call, and ever since it has been the cry
wherever Australians congregate.
* * * *
“Vic”: Queensland is going great licks
in health reform. The Government has
appointed Dr. Cilento, senior medical
administrator at Canberra, as Director
of Public Health at a salary which will
rise from £l5OO p.a. to £2OOO p.a. in
five years. He will “completely control
and reorganise the health services,” and
his first job will be the elimination of
Weil’s disease in the North. For the
rest he will be given management of
medical services, insanity, aged people’s
homes, hospitals and medical sections of
the Education, Agriculture and Stock
Departments. The hospital system will
be reorganised, the Local Authorities
Acts will be amended if the Forgan Smith
Government gets back next year, and
Health and Local Government will be
brigaded together under a new Minister.
# * * *
“Sounder”: This North always gets
’em in time. Take a recent notice in
the “N. Q. Register”: “R. Donald
(senior) notifies the public that he has
disposed of his storekeeping business at
the Laura, thanks those who have
given him their support for the past
50 years, and trusts the same will be
continued to his sons.” The Laura
is a collection of tin houses at the dead
end of the Cooktown railway—of old
the jumping-off place for the Palmer.
The Donalds ran a store, a pub, a bit
of a cattle station and sundry other
things. J remember old Bob Donald
over 40 years ago. He was well on in
years then, with a beard old Santa Claus
might envy, while his wife mothered the
whole district, irrespective of color.
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
Lady Mayoress Jones presided over a meet-
ing to discuss the formation of a new House-
wives’ Association. There is one already, but
its members have agreed to incorporate with
the new body. The proposals seemed rather
nebulous. It is proposed to provide permanent
employment for girls by setting them to make
wool-filled quilts for export, to establish a per-
manent exhibition of Queensland-made goods,
and to gather a body of uniformed girls at a
nominal wage to assist housewives with their
work. It seems a queer way of “raising domes-
tic work to a higher plane” to pay less for it.
At Paddington there is a Mothers’ Club. Its
members make no fuss, and get little publicity.
They look after Mrs. So-and-so’s house and
cook meals for her when she is ill or taking a
rare “day out.” They mind each other’s chil-
dren, and altogether have created a fine little
help society. At present they are working for a
fair, which will be held in November, to raise
’some money for the Children’s Playground.
Miss Bedford, who is one of the most con-
sistent workers for children, is organising a
Book Day to replenish playground libraries.
She wants any book, old or new, in good con-
dition, suitable for children. Country people
may direct their parcels to the hon. sec., Play-
grounds Association, St. Mary’s, t Kangaroo
Point; or they will be picked up at any railway
station.
Mrs. H. S. Foil was the guest of honor at a
tea-party given by Mrs. Rhodes Wood at
Rowe’s. The table was gay with poppies. At
another table Mrs. H. Magee, in red and white,
fed a small party, and Mrs. H. C. Richards and
Mrs. D. A. A. Davis had no fewer than sixty
guests at their party, which was a “bridge
aflair. Mrs. E. B. Boyce, who is off to Syd-
ney, was another hostess, and she looked very
smart in her big picture hat of black lace and
black-and-white georgette frock.
St. John s Cathedral will provide the setting
for the wedding of Olga Sayle and Frank Mar-
tin on October 3. Pat and Marjorie Sale
and Lucy Martin will be the three bridesmaids.
Hankies enough to last her a lifetime were
showered on Fay Riithning at a tea arranged
by Marmie and Kath Turner. Mrs. E. P.
Turner helped to entertain. The hostesses gave
a set of hand-embroidered lingerie to the
glory-box Kath is to be one of the brides-
maids.
• fhe V .W.C.A. arranged a competition called
My Lady's Dress.’’ Each entrant had to
produce a frock which, with the exception, ol
the sewing-cotton, had not cost more than live
shillings. The Lady Mayoress and Gwen Wat-
son and Mollic Brenan were the judges. They
have made their decision, but the announce-
ment . has been withheld until to-day; when
the girls will parade in their creations. It is
astonishing what can be done for 55., pro-
vided one has the right kind of fingers.
Since 1929 the Church of England has in-
terested itself in unemployed single men. A
hostel in Brunswick-street proved too small,
and the Church acquired a large old house on
North Quay and is erecting a big wing on to
it. Our Sir Leslie laid the foundation-stone.
Since the hostel started about 300 meals have
been served daily. The C.E.M.S. is primarily
responsible, and Archbishop Wand had a kind
word to say for the society when he blessed the
stone. Later on, when Old Man Depresh has
been finally k.o.’d, the hostel will provide shelter
for aged men.
Lena Hammond’s choir concert, with Nell
Johnson (soprano), Nell Burnett (contralto).
Doris Wilde (mezzo) and Arthur Procter as
soloists, was a huge success. Jack Foster, who
also should have appeared, developed mumips
at the eleventh hour; so the sextet from
“Lucia,” which should have been the opening
item, had to be cut out. The girls’ choir, how-
ever, sang two delightful Irish folk songs.
Bach’s “Magnificat” took up the second half
of the programme.
At the same time as Mrs. Willie Collins
entertained a house party, a fete in aid of the
Beaudesert Hospital was staged in her grounds.
The guests were Mr. and Mrs. Charlie Persse,
Hugo Brassey—we don’t know yet whether
he is or is not engaged to Lily Damita —Mollie
Brenan and a few others.
Eddie Cahill went down last week to stay at
Nindooimbah for a few days. His farewell
concert is to be held there, and then he goes to
Europe.
The Roy Dices, transferred from our military
set to Grafton, were entertained vigorously
prior to their departure.
When next a trade report is prepared the
official responsible should write down “debs.”
as Queensland’s chief product. In spite of the
hundreds who already have emerged from the
chrysalis, more will come out at the Lady
Mayoress's Ball. Peggy Chauncey is busily teach-
ing them how to wangle their trains and dip a
curtsy.
Winifred Ponder has got homesick for Java,
and is returning to that delectable isle. Mrs.
E. B. Harris staged a farewell party of literary
and professional women for her. • She now is
so well acclimatised that she regards this State
as her home.
Our R.A.C.Q. has got a new and swanky
home of its own in Petrie’s Bight. The Gover-
nor declared it open, and was presented with
a key. As the eleventh annual conference of
the Australian Automobile Association hap-
pened at that time, the buiiding came in
handy. In 1905 there were just the bare
dozen members of the R.A.C.Q., and now
there are 9000. Careful saving and cautious
investment allowed the club to purchase the
land on which the new building stands for
£sooo—a good deal.
Lady Wilson and daughter Marjorie will
leave London at the end of the month by the
Orontes, due in Melbourne on November 5.
They will see the Cup before returning to
Brisbane.
Our new Anglican archbishop has suffered
a sad loss; his son, Paul Wand, and a com-
panion have been killed climbing Mont Blanc.
Hundreds of messages of affectionate sympathy
have been received.
Before the news of her brother’s death arrived,
Kathleen Wand, the archbishop’s daughter, had
become sports mistress at St. Hilda’s School,
Southport —she is relieving the holder of the
job, who is holidaying in England. Miss Wand
has cups for swimming, and was a member of
the Bedfordshire hockey team. Swimming,
tennis, netball, lacrosse and hockey are
her sports.
Flags of 60 nations in. which Rotary Clubs
flourish were a feature of the City Hall decora-
tions when the Rotary Ball was held. The
Creche and Kindergarten will benefit. The
bridge lounges and the supper-room simply
shouted “Spring,” and were gay with poppies,
roses and sweet-peas. Mrs. Farquhar looked
after the bridge reservations, and lots of people
seemed to prefer trumping their partners’ aces
to doing the light fantastic.
Knight Donald Cameron, A. E. Moore and
Hannibal King judged the living blossoms at
the Floral Festival. Mrs. Hannibal King origi-
nated the idea, and some of Brisbane’s prettiest
girls helped. Only the face peeped through
from the centre of the screens, which were
massed with real spring flowers. Profits went
to the Creche and Kindergarten.
Ever so many Brisbane girls have “heard the
East a-callin’ ” lately, and packed the frills and
furbelows for a trip to China and Japan. The
latest tourists are Andrea and Bess Hawkins
and Doreen and Nancy Dunlop, who departed
by the Changte.
Miss B. Schroder, an indefatigable worker for
incapacitated Diggers, arranged, with the help
of the members of the Attunga tennis club, a
bridge afternoon in the Lady Mayoress’s
reception-rooms. Over 300 people attended, and
almost £3O was raised. This goes to the dis-
tress fund of the Incapacitated sub-branch of
the R.5.5.1.L.A., which does not accept as a
member anyone whose war disabilities are
rated lower than 50 p.c.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Every woman forswore her slimming
diet when she saw the supper the P.
and O. Co. gave at the Maloja Ball.
Practically everyone plumped for
pheasant pie. The supper buffet was
colorful; they even had a red arum lily
decorating one of the hams. There were
turkeys, innumerable things in aspic,
fruit and nuts ; lobster and fish (perhaps
lobster is fish, but it was of a slab of the
latter that a man asked “Is it Scotch?”
and there was quite an apologetic note
in the steward’s voice as he replied,
“No, sir. I'm afraid it’s Australian”).
In spite of all this the buffet afterwards
on the deck was well patronised, and
the wine cups were kept in constant
circulation.
The ship with all its lights gleamed a
sparkling silver thing in the moonlight.
In the distance the arch of the bridge
rose black and mysterious. The decks
were awninged, and shoulders brushed
balloons in unexpected places. At the
top of the bunting-hung gangway, the
liner’s captain and E. A. Eva and his
wife welcomed the Acting-Governor and
his lady, her frock of pink-and-gold-
splashed flamisol showing up effectively
against Mrs. Eva’s black satins. Couples
sat in secluded corners ; groups gathered
in the silver-wood-panelled lounges. In
one, the Feakses held court. Music
played softly for 500 dancers, among
them Diana Davidson, whose ivory
crepes showed black godets as she swung
past. The Justice Maxwells came, her
periwinkle-blue crepes enlivened with a
spray of golden nasturtiums. W. M.
Hughes’s Helen was in Margaret Burns’s
party. Lily-of-the-valley adorned Mrs.
W. J. Hurry’s amethyst laces, and Janet
Thatcher and Deborah Mackay-Sim were
two others who danced through the
night.
The arrival of the M.L. cruisers
Dunedin and Diomede will do much to
put a kick into the races. Rear-Admiral
F. Burgess Watson and his officers are
having a busy time of it. Monday
(Dominion Day) found them at the
opening of the new offices of the M.L.
Tourist and Trade Commissioner. They
have lunched with the Millions and the
Rotarians, were the attraction at the
N.Z. Women’s Assoc.’s ball in their
honor at Farmer’s Oak Room, and have
spent a night with the Savage Club.
To-morrow they lunch with the Premier
at Parliament House. In the afternoon
they will meet, if they haven’t already
done so, Sydney’s brightest and most
beauteous maidens at the naval Popes’
at-home in the Penguin.
Quite a brass-hat affair was the
R.A.A.F. dance. To it came the de-
fenders of the Empire by air, land and
sea. Ribbons and flowers in the Force’s
red and two shades of blue decorated
all the tables. The No. 3 Squadron
band played the official party to their
place, and then broke into the National
Anthem. The Acting-Governor and his
lady, she in black-embossed velvets,
found many friends to greet. Squadron-
Leader W. D. Bostock’s wife wore lime
windswept crepes; the Mayor’s lady
trailed black velvets. Silver- and blue-
bead embroideries brightened up the
shoulders of Mrs. Harrie Vale’s black
georgettes, and daughter Joyce danced in
lacquer-red laces. Major Ellis brought
his wife in black-lacquered satin, and
one young girl wore a dei of wistaria with
her grey-green chiffons.
Grace Lane climbed out of her “Sacred
Flame” mourning garment and into rosy
satins on Thursday after the show and
with Gerald Savory hied herself to the
Independents’ hop at Hordern Bros.
Here they found Doris Fitton (she's
treated as a queen at the club’s revels), in
dusty-pink georgettes, holding court. Mrs.
Heath Green was one of the importants
of the night. Sec. Mrs. Geo. Brown
danced in mauve georgette, and attrac-
tive Eva Kuraz had in her party the
equally attractive Virginia Ferrante, for
whom her parents, Italy’s Consular
couple, had given a coming-out dance a
few nights before. Among the 400 young
things whose energy was in no way
affected by the heat were Anne- Gordon,
Valerie Bavin and Jean Elwing.
This is George Johnston’s portrait of
Audrey, daughter of Mrs. Norman Con-
nell. Audrey rides, but only when she
goes for holidays up Gulargambone way,
where the family years ago used to own
a property. She plays tennis both in
town and country. She is known also
for her dress sense, and is one of the
young things you will see trying to pick
winners at the spring meeting.
At the auction sale of that part of
the Rona estate lying between the Knox
family’s stronghold and Colin Stephen’s
home, Sam Hordern, tall and slim as a
young poplar, stood beside his wife, who
had the only chair not in occupation by
the auctioneer’s clerks. She wore a blue-
and-white-patterned crepe; her small
white hat was of gleaming white satin.
Mrs. O. E. Friend walked in a mink coat.
Mrs. A. J. Warry found her blue shoot-
ing-stick a comfort while the bidding
went on. Colin Stephen (a trustee) sat
on another just below the auctioneer’s
table, handy to be referred to when the
bidding reached critical proportions.
Also present were the Sheldon knight
and his lady, Judge Ferguson and Alister
and Phillipa Stephen. Under Phillipa’s
arms were two very shining black-coated
dogs, unanimous and untiring in their
efforts to get away.
There was every inducement to buy.
The view is superb from all the five lots,
and there is no possibility of being built
in. The day was perfect. Below, the
blue waters of Port Jackson sparkled in
the sunlight; yachts with their white
sails played in and around the little bays.
On the left you could see Longueville,
and on the right the Heads. Restrictions
surrounded purchases. A house must
not be more than three storeys high, in-
cluding the attic ; it must be of stone,
and the roof must be of slate or tile.
The pick of the sites went for £6O a foot,
and if rumor is correct the young Sam
Horderns will soon be busily engaged
with plans, architects and builders.
In Sydney is Dr. Sydney Nicholson,
composer and authority on English
church music. But Sydney’s interest in
him is of a more personal nature. His
father was our Uni.’s first Chancellor,
one of its founders and not the least of
its benefactors. To its first Chancellor
the Uni. owes the Nicholson Museum
and the distinction of being the first out-
side the British Isles to secure the Royal
Charter, while the beauty of the Great
Hall owes a lot to his knowledge of archi-
tecture. Many of the pictures on its
walls were his gifts, as were the tapes-
tries and the great stained windows.
Last week, exactly 100 years after the
father’s arrival in
Australia, the
youngest son had
conferred on him
the degree of
Master of Arts.
This took place at
the Commemora-
tion of Benefac-
tors, and during
the reading of the
impressive list he
had a seat of
honor on the dais
at the right hand
of the black-and-
gold-robed Chan-
cellor. After the
ceremony Dr.
Nicholson gave a
lecture on church
music (and even
while this Letter is
getting into its rosy
pinafore he is giv-
ing another, this
time with the aid
of gramophone re-
cords). Then the
carillon rang out
and the organ
pealed. Those in
the gallery stood ;
the Chancellor and
the professors
made their colorful
way down the hall
and back through
the grey stone
cloisters. Then
there were chatter
and savories in the Union for all.
No one can say the Australian isn’t
a reader. Fourteen-thousand books,
besides magazines and papers, were sent
out last year by the Bush Book Club.
One man asked for “Egyptology”;
another for Barnes’s “Commentary on
the Revelation” or “Down the Garden
Path,” by Beverley Nichols.
The business girl and boy are finding
it easy to drop in with their offerings
to the club’s new rooms at Challis
House. The rooms are large and airy
and the Gov. parcels office is just below
stairs. Friends, among them Acting-
Governor Street and his wife, came
and drank a dish of tea with the
president, the Kelso King lady, on col-
lection day, which was turned into a house-
warming. Diana Davidson came with
Freda Bedford, and found her mother
smiling on her from a photograph on the
wall (collection day was Dame Mar-
garet’s idea) and founder Mrs. Aubrey
Withers looking on the day’s doings
from her place on the mantelpiece. In
a huge bronze bowl in the passage-way
purple iris, pink fruit-blossom, white
and red azaleas and arum lilies spilled
their fragrance. When everyone was gone
and the day’s takings were counted, sec.
Beulah Bolton found she had to make
room for 700 more books, 743 maga-
zines and nearly 2000 papers and had
the joy before her of spending £ll
the type of books that no one ever thinks
of giving away.
The sudden death of Mary Severn
last week came as a severe shock to
Sydneyites of the old school. She had
been prominent in the social life of the
city for over 60 years. In ways she was
a typical Stephen—she was the young-
est of the great Chief Justice’s family.
She had charming manners and never for-
got a face or name. Mrs. Severn had
the Stephen gift of longevity ; she was 78
when she died, and on looks she might
have been 20 years younger. Her
Bohemian streak, which she shared with
her husband “Monty,” who predeceased
her a couple of years ago, was what
differentiated her from other members
of her immense family. She had danced
with the present King (then a middy)
at Government House, and she had fore-
gathered with every subsequent royalty
to visit Australia, and she met them all
over again when she went to London to
stay with her husband’s brother. But to
the end of her life she had a predilec-
tion for the society of theatrical folk
and members of the bridge world. She
was deeply religious and a passionate
lover of animals. She worked for several
charities, but the movement to which
she gave whole-hearted service was the
R.S.P.C.A.
After 33 years Mrs. McCulloch
Hughes has screwed the top on her
fountain-pen and said good-bye to her
secretarial job at the Queen Victoria
Homes. Now her address is 52 Macleay-
street. What a party she had! All the
board cgme. There were individual gifts
of posies and an armful of purple
anenomes and pink hyacinths. There
were a wristlet watch, a handbag, a
cheque and (most prized of all) a little
leather-bound book, its pages decorated
with pictures of the Homes in water-
colors, in which every member of the
board signed his name. The rooms at
the Women’s Club were massed with the
glory of spring. The flowers had come
from Thirwell and Wentworth Falls with
messages of love from staff and inmates.
There was nothing formal. W. G. Layton
made the presentation; Dr. Mclntyre
Sinclair and J. J. James insisted on add-
ing their quota of nice words; Mrs.
Layton looked after the frail little guest
of honor ; Rose Scott sang, and Mrs. A.
M. Smythe and Mrs. W. J. Edwards
smiled over the success of their idea.
If you’re a vagabond at heart you’ll
enjoy the Vagabond Cabaret at the Pom-
padour Rooms next Wednesday. It’s
going to be better fun than any artists’
ball, so the committee says. The pro-
gramme calls for vagabond music by
vagabond players (Justin Harve and his
merry men). The revels will rage from
10 till 4 ; supper will be on from mid-
night onwards. Gladys Moncrieff and
Robert Chisholm say they wouldn’t miss
it for worlds ; he’s going to sing and Eve
Alwyn is going to dance. There will be
street musicians and gipsy entertainers.
Artist Nance Mackenzie did the life-
size and life-like posters of Bohemians
that will adorn the walls. Altogether a
good show where you can celebrate your
winnings or forget your losses. The
Free Kindergartens benefit.
All through the years the Clerical
Women War Workers have not ceased
to remember the sick soldiers in the
Prince of Wales Hospital. They cheer
them through the year with entertain-
ments, and at Christmastime there is, so
to speak, a gala performance. Only
once every 12 months do they make a
public appeal. This year the date to ear-
mark is October 16, the place St. James’s
Hall and the play “The Love Game,”
put on by the Vagabonds.

Melbourne
Chatter
One reason which delays the Vic. Scot-
tish Regiment from getting into its kilts
is the scarcity of white horses. The
sporran to go with the Gordon tartan
which is worn by the regiment requires
bushels of hair from the manes and tails
of such horses —greys won’t do. At the
mess dance officers wore scarlet or dark-
blue coats and their Gordon tartan trou-
sers. Eight of them, plus partners, had re-
hearsed the Scottish reel (front-page
stuff since Princess Marina learnt the
steps in Scotland). Colonel Mathieson
performed the sprightly dance opposite
his young daughter Jean, clad all in
white. The audience enjoyed shouting
and stamping its applause even more
than the performers did their encored
dance to the tune of a single piper. Mrs.
Mathieson’s georgette dress was of the
same red as her husband’s coat. Brig.-
General and Mrs. McColl were present.
Colonel Derham brought his wife clad
in black lace. The Leitch lady put in an
appearance in duck-egg green satin. Jean
Williams wore a bronze floral-pattern
embossed with gold thread, and Joyce
Hansen was in pink with a spray ’ of
sweet-peas on her shoulder. Neville
Stuart and Harry Wright were there, and
fan MacKenzie, wearing a kilt of the
MacKenzie tartan. Unofficial pipers
rehearsed in the yard around a cauldron
of what was suspected to be haggis, but
turned out to be soup.
The two-year-old Youth Movement of
the League of Nations Union held its
first frivolous function at lllawarra,
Toorak. A cheery log-fire was reflected
in the beautiful parquet floor of the
entrance hall, filled with fruit-blossom
and surrounded by a curling staircase.
There is a Juliet balcony which overlooks
the ballroom. In the supper-room each
spray of almond-blossom arranged in a
low flat bowl was reflected in the pol-
ished surface of a large round table,
lllawarra’s chatelaine, who lent the ball-
room for daughter Peggy’s favorite
Youth Movement, wore blue flowers
round the neck of her black dress.
Peggy had a rose in her twisted locks
and split shoulders in her plumbago-blue
velvet. Mrs. Guy Bakewell trailed the
purple of grapes. Freda Latham’s black
frills descended from narrow shoulder-
straps, and Jessie Brookes tied an orange
sash round her bullfrog-green.
Alice Carse hid her shoulders beneath
several layers of pink cape and white
camellias. Jean Rentoul wore orange
taffetas and twin knots of hair on the
nape of her neck. Peggy Dixon was in
mist-blue with a split along the upper
vertebrae, Peggy Broadhead melted into
mist-grey ninon and Peggy Sawrey was
in swamp-green. Nancy Walstad twisted
a black sash round her shrimp-pink lace.
Also in pink was Ruth Littleton, and the
Youth Movement’s secretary, Nancy
Wickham, wore black velvet and a
camellia. So successful was the dance
that Mrs. Churton has decided to let her
ballroom for social functions.
The Phelia Grimwade House at C. of
E. Girls’ Grammar School was very
bright and cheery for the annual dance
organised for the extension fund. There
were two dance-rooms, two orchestras
and two relays for supper. A committee
of girls’ mothers came in relays to the
school during the day to prepare fruit-
cup, salads, etc., and to decorate the
rooms with branches of blossom and the
tables with bowls of flowers. In the
evening the mothers were assisted behind
the scenes by Miss Beecroft and Miss
Bates, and managed intermissions to
watch youth enjoying itself. Miss Gil-
man Jones, in her favorite shade of
peacock-blue satin, and Miss M. Mont-
gomery welcomed past and present
students and their partners. Captain of
the school Betty Sewell wore turquoise-
blue crepe, Margaret Kiddle was filmy
in black tulle, Nancy Cuthbertson’s
dusty-pink foamed into tulle ruchings
and Joan Purnell’s white satin was orna-
mented with jade accessories. Lynette
Walker’s black velvet frock was twinkly
with silver lame near neck and shoulders.
Marjorie Nicholas was in floral crepe with
tones of blue predominating, and Mar-
garet McCutcheon wore deep wine-red.
The Arts and Crafts Society of Vic.,
which has been in existence for 25 years,
is running a 10-day exhibition in the lower
Town Hall. From the allotment at the
top of the stairs, reserved for the rush
and reed accessories, Lady Huntingfield
performed the opening ceremony. Hold-
ing on her wrist a presentation flat
rush basket filled with primroses she gave
a short address which included words of
praise for the machine-made articles of
to-day—but their high standard is only
reached through the originality of artists
and designers who are kept busy by
employment with competitive firms. She
added a P.S. on the improvement of
labels on Australian exported goods.
Very attractive were the curtains, rugs
and table-linens. One handsome floor-
rug was made from waste skein-wool and
undyed fleece; the design was copied
from a 16th-century ceiling at Cam-
bridge. There’s a revival of patchwork
and candlewick quilts, the latter so-called
after the little tufts of linen thread like
wicks of candles which are their form of
decoration. The photographic section
includes beautiful exhibits by Dr. Julian
Smith and Ruth Horlick. Among the
book-plates is a fish design around the
name of Frances Zabel.
A model sunroom at ope end of the
hall contains a stool covered in calfskin
and a lounge with a gaily-striped mat-
tress made from cylindrical bolsters
joined together. Patients from the Or-
thopaedic Hospital had a corner devoted
to their craft-work in leather, wool, wood
and embroidery—articles of great credit
to the crippled children.
Wearing the youthful spotty bow at
her throat is Lynette, only child of Mr.
and Mrs. Harold Walker. She’s an old
girl of C. of E. Grammar School, where
she distinguished herself by doing two
years’ Leaving Honors and winning a
Domestic Science and Arts exhibition.
She’s now in her first year Arts. Lynette
was one of the panniered and white-
wigged girls who went skating through
the minuet on the recent final night at
the Glaciarium, She plays tennis and has
several trophies for her agility (swim-
ming, diving and greasy-pole) at the
Davey Bay Yacht Club Regatta, which
is an annual festivity at Frankston. The
Walker trio always spend part of every
summer at their Frankston home. Broo-
thorn made the picture.
The liftman at the Athenaeum is used
to crowds. His lift has the minimum
of floor-space, but it’s built for heavy-
weights and does its job nobly on days
like the opening of the Twenty Painters’
Exhibition. The gallery was so full of
people that nobody under 6ft., with good
manners, could get more than a glimpse
of the pictures. However, the intense
green background of W. Rowell’s “Miss
Modern” was noticed by most, and
smaller things, like Carl Hampel’s
“Spring Flowers” and “A Young Nurse”
by Margery Withers, managed to be
seen. In the throng were Mrs. E. Barnes
and attractive daughter Peggy, in a cun-
ning black hat and a starched white
ruffle. Peggy does clever fashion draw-
ings. She and her mother have recently
returned from England. Mrs. Yuncken,
wearing a white camellia, was accom-
panied by her daughter in blue. Carmen
Winter, blonde and handsome in her
severe black suit, chatted with Ivy Ball.
Harold Holt, Egan Eggleston and Grant
Mclntyre were a legal group that seemed
to be wedged in one corner. Tall etcher
Victor Cobb could see things. Mrs.
Henry Clarkson was there, and an attrac-
tive little Frenchwoman, Mrs. H. L.
Wilkinson, in green. Roma Smith’s
beret caused a sensation. It was large,
white and squashy. Russian dancer
Sonia Revid arrived with her fuzzy dark
head uncovered. Her portrait was exhi-
bited by Isabel Tweddle.
Every year Fritz Hart produces and
the Albert-street Con. performs an opera
which has never before been given
in Melbourne. This year’s choice was
“Tantivy Towers,” which had a season
at the King’s. Dancing isn’t on the
itinerary of the Con. people, but in the
fancy-dress scene a frilly pierrette in the
chorus managed a noble high kick.
There being neither dialogue nor sum-
mary of the plot on the programme, it
was difficult to follow the adventures of a
horde of artists in the Tantivy ancestral
mansion, but Eileen Kelly and Vincent
McMurray and Beatrice Oakley and
George Walker seemed happy holding
hands before the final hunting canter.
Charles Evans, as the Earl of Tantivy,
wore white gloves and some giddy check
suits.
Philip Hargrave, noticeably taller and
broader than he was 18 months ago, is
just the same unspoilt, captivating young-
ster. He’s not in the least conceited,
doesn’t know what it is to be nervous,
and loves the society of other children—
age doesn’t matter; he can play happily
with a boy of five or a girl of 14.
For the concert on Saturday in the
well-filled Town Hall Philip wore his
white suit, and received laurel wreaths
and boxes of chocolates. Behind the
scenes was Miss Garnaut (“Auntie
Hettie”), in deep Burgundy velvet, her
little coatee with its lame cuffs slipping
over a fur-trimmed gown. Helena Fisher
wore a green velvet coat with her trained
gold lace dress. Miss Garnaut has
looked after her niece Helena since she
was three days old, and she’s cared for
Philip since he was very small. They
are both a great credit to her.
After the concert there was a tremen-
dous crush in the dressing-room—small
boys with autograph books ; little girls
with bows in the hair and frilly party
frocks asking for Philip’s signature upon
their programmes ; men and women of
all ages. The crowd (not a typical stage-
door crowd, but people inspired by
genuine interest rather than curiosity)
left only a narrow lane down the marble
steps for the little star to pass through,
and the portico was a jamb of people.
And all this adulation has never threat-
ened to turn the child’s head!
At the suggestion of their daughters,
Mr. and Mrs. J. G. Massey gave a young
folks’ dance at Grosvenor. Meg Massey
wore white splashed with the gaiety of
spring flowers; Noreen’s dress was pat-
terned with a marble design in varied
shades of blue, and her wispy coatee was
of taffetas. Colonel and Mrs. W. K.
Fethers, May and Flo Gillespie, Nancy
and Margaret Fancourt, Jean Mcßeath,
Cecil McNaughton, Bob Lemon and Ivor
Whittaker were a few of those invited.
The smile caught by Broothorn be-
tween silver fox and a small veiled hat
belongs to Mrs. Hylton Dale. With her
husband she left last week on a flying
visit to Westralia—literally flying both
ways across the Nullarbor Plains and per
car through the Mel bourne-Adel aide
section. Mrs. Hylton Dale is small and
vivacious, she speaks four languages, is
interested in music and is a buyer of
pictures. She was born in London, and
commenced a life of much travel at the
age of three months. Constantinople
is one of the places she’s visited and
Egypt one of the countries she knows,
having lived there for 18 years. The Hyl-
ton Dale couple will give an at-home at
the Windsor on October 18 for centenary
visitors Sir Maurice and Lady Hankey.
W. H. Rutledge managed to hand over
each of his daughters to her chosen
bridegroom in St. Mary’s C. of E., Caul-
field (with a double wedding there might
be a mix-up). The brides’ magnolia
trains and tulle veils swept up the aisle
on either side of their father. At the
altar L. J. Bishop anxiously waited for
Gwladys, and C. G. Warren was con-
siderably relieved when he found his
arm brushed by Mavis’s sheaf of lilies.
Swords of the Air Force formed an
archway outside St. Mary’s Church of
England, Caulfield, for Flight-Lieut. and
Mrs. F. J. B. Wight. The bride was
Leslie Phyllis, daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
T. O. Watson. Her all-white toilette
had silver suggestions upon sleeve inser-
tions, girdle and leaves blowing upon the
tulle veil which foamed over a bouquet
of azaleas and lily-of-the-valley. Atten-
dants in delphinium-blue taffetas were
matrons Mrs. A. D. Burgoyne and Mrs.
W. T. Watson, ’maids Betty Wight and
Kathleen McClelland and small train-
bearer Margaret Ann Burgoyne, who
rustled all-white frills of organdie. Cake
and toasts were at Tudor Court.
Our police force is having its exams.
Even motorists who pass the same inter-
sections at the same hour each day and
reach a nodding acquaintance with the
man on point duty never think of him in
terms of textbooks and pushing a pen
across an exam, paper. Last week a Black
Maria sent a gorgeous thrill of apprehen-
sion through the students when it drew
up outside Winthrop Hall to disgorge
four huge policemen. Undergrads, with
guilty consciences hid in lockers; others
summoned their courage and followed the
posse. Its business was only to borrow
90 chairs for the police exam, candidates.
The sports girl will have much to
interest her in the programme arranged
for the end of the year. On December
1 there’s to be a rally of 3000 girls who
will take an oath of allegiance to ama-
teurism on the Melbourne Cricket.
Ground and a sportswomen’s dinner on
the same evening. Men may smile in
a superior manner at the women’s Test
cricket, Australia v. England, which com-
mences on December 8, but the players
are intensely serious about it. The
Women’s Swimming and Rowing Assoc,
will hold a carnival on the same day.
Basketball matches are booked for the
end of October ; baseball and bowls for
the middle of November. Women of
straight eye and steady hand are expected
from all States and M.L. to display
their skill on Melbourne’s smoothest
bowling greens.
Mrs. Ely Culbertson has got in at the
right time with her article on bridge in
the August number of the “Ladies’
Home Journal.” She and her husband
have become famous and made a lot of
money through being contract experts,
but they are wise enough to appreciate
the danger of too much of a good thing.
Possibly, they feel as stale themselves
as a Davis Cup player does at the end of
seven or eight consecutive summers.
Apart from the effect on the Culbert-
sons’ finances of a slump in contract (for
a slump often follows a surfeit), Mrs.
Ely sees that a woman bridge fiend’s job
of wife and mother isn’t as well done
as it might be. She advises women to
play less, and only once a week, at night,
if their husbands are not bridge players.
The husbands whose, digestions are at
the mercy of a bridge fiend’s cooking
will give three cheers for Mrs. Ely.
Sausages fried in a hurry, with blackened
skins and raw interiors, and tasteless
vegetables boiled in the one saucepan
to save washing up are not conducive
towards amiability. Neither are a diet of
meringues, and so many chocolates and
nuts that the afternoon bridge player
can’t look at her dinner, helpful towards
keeping a comely figure.
The John Russell Clarkes have re-
turned from eight months’ honeymoon-
ing abroad. Mrs. Clarke (before her
marriage she was Alison Milne, of Adel-
aide), Diana Hordern, of Sydney, and
Marjorie Wilson, daughter of Queens-
land’s Governor, were presented at the
same Court.
Gilbert Mant writes from Ottawa that
Kathleen, chick of the Gippsland Pat-
tersons, passed through with a round-
the-world record Marco Polo might have
envied. She left Melbourne in April, and
was in Canada in August. In the mean-
time she had visited England, Venice,
Vienna, Switzerland, France, Scotland,
Ireland, New York, Washington, Atlan-
tic City, Philadelphia and Montreal. She
left Ottawa bound for Niagara Falls,
the Chicago World’s Fair, the Rockies
and then China and Japan. She said
she was due back in Melbourne in
October.
Boys and girls who fill their non-work-
ing hours with the pursuit of physical fit-
ness don’t always get sympathy from an
older generation. A ratepayer living near
a Surrey Hills Scout Hall complains that
residents have to sleep behind closed
doors and windows with cotton-wool in
their ears during the “awful crashing,
stamping, yelling, screeching and loud
drum-beating” of Scouts learning to be
disciplined citizens. He is on the warpath
also against a girls’ athletic club which
“dresses itself like the Folies Bergeres
and makes hideous noises” one night
each week.
Mrs. Dudley Brunton always thinks
of some original scheme of decoration
for her parties. For a social occasion
recently she whitewashed all her palms
and colored whatnots, so that everything
in the room was white. She recently
gave a party for Barbara Holmes, of
Bathurst. All - white almond - blossom,
white stocks and camellias were mingled
with red carnations, and a garland of
scarlet flowers was looped across the
wall.

Margaret Alice Gordon, misted in
tulle and trailing ivory satins, was
handed by father, shipping man T. S.
Gordon, to the altar of St. Mark’s on
Friday evening. Here flying-officer R.
A. Holmwood, in his air-force blue,
waited with the ring. Bride’s sister Helen
"maided in ice-blue befrilled chiffons,
her hands filled with plum-blossom and
forget-me-nots and a coronet of the blue
flower in her hair. The after-rejoicings
were at the Gordon home, Point Piper.
Those on the lookout for something
different in the way of floor-coverings
shouldn’t overlook the big show of
Oriental rugs and carpets that is being
staged at Anthony Horderffs. To the
beautiful hand-woven silks of Persia and
the barbarically bright Kelim Shiraz pro-
ductions of India have been added a
vast variety of Chinese carpets. Most
of these are described as “washed.”
That’s not a reflection on Chinese clean-
liness, but a trade term indicating a
chemical process that adds lustre to the
colors and protects them against the
cleaning operations they may have to
encounter during their long life. Some
of the colors—blues especially —seem to
be a Chinese secret; they are found on
textiles from no other part of the globe.
THE LITTLE SISTERS.
WESTRALIA.
The committee of the Movie Ball in-
stalled more decorations in Government
House ballroom than had been seen
there for many a day. The back of the
dais was hung with black velvet, with a
central figure of Terpsichore in a huge
hoop of colored lights ; talkie banners
ran the length of the galleries, and over-
head was a canopy of miniature flags
festooned with gaily-lit Chinese lanterns.
Between the dances and the Lashbrook
ballet numbers a screen was lowered
and humorous talkie shorts were given
under the direction of organiser E.
McKinley. Chairman Stan Perry was
there with his slender better-half, who
wrapped a white fur coat over her black
silk crepes. Mrs. McKinley’s rosy taf-
fetas were sashed and flowered with
velvet; Mrs. Victor Williams’s primrose
matelasse was girt with a wide ruching
which ran around the neck and along
the hem of the sweeping train; Mrs.
Frank Whitford clasped diamente on
the bosom of her ebony satins, and
Peggy James held her white marocains
together with lashings of tubular pipings.
The Featherstonhaugh-Waldie Forbes
knot was tied to a choral accompani-
ment at St. Luke’s, Cottesloe. Ivory
satin completely enveloped Madeleine
Forbes’s svelte lines, and a cloud of
tulle, attached to a coronet of orange-
blossom, semi-concealed its shimmering
richness to the point of the long, chiffon-
lined train. Betty Hobbs and bride’s
sister Hetty brought up the rear, their
respective pastel-pink and blue crepes
embossed with silver and gold roses,
cowled at the neck and waving frills at
the back; miniature gold-and-silver
leaves haloed their heads, and sheaves
of pink carnations lay on their arms.
The groom is son of Mrs. and the late
Percy Featherstonhaugh, and hails from
Clare, S.A., where the couple will make
their home. •
St. Mary’s O.G.A. booked the Pleiades
Club for its dance and served a buffet-
supper in the dining-room. Headmis-
tress Miss E. Dannat smiled on the do-
ings in Wedgwood blue brocade, with
Miss Hillferty’s black velvets to her right
and Miss Mason’s russet browns to the
left. Helen Smith officiated in orchid
matelasse and Vyvyan Guy’s black
tulle billowed above lace as she buzzed
about secretarially. Mrs. Kevin Kelly’s
dove-grey chiffons sprouted silver lame
folds; Mrs. Tom Flintoff hung frilled
spotted net from a black taffeta corsage ;
Francie Dodd ornamented white satin
with silver sequins, and Ruth Robinson
sported a halo of silver leaves above
white taffeta.
Christa Winsloe’s “Children in Uni-
form” filed past packed audiences at
the Repertory Theatre for four nights.
Dorothy Mark laid a skilful hand on
the reiris of production and led her large
team of players through a sympathetic
presentation. Peggy Nunn’s Fraulein
von Bernberg was played with sincerity
and conviction ; Elsie McCallum gave a
forceful portrayal of the Prussian head-
mistress ; the difficult role of Manuela
fell to Edna Smily, and Patti Rees,
Dorothy Fleming, Sylvia George and
others did well in minor parts.
Members of the Pleiades Club turned
up in force as guests of the president
and committee. Mrs. Norton’s nut-brown
marocains were the background for a
posy of fragrant violets as she greeted
the horde and waved them into the
lounge for bridge. Tea was served con-
tinuously in the dining-room, and prizes
were collected by Mrs. Mac Rutter,
Beryl Bitchley, Ruth Robinson and
Margaret Giles.
The Executive Council of the House-
wives’ Association put on a morning-tea
at the Carlton Club in honor of Mrs.
H. Gregory, who will represent the
assoc, at the forthcoming conference in
Melbourne. Mrs. Revell, Mrs. Coleman
May and Mrs. Blackmore made speeches
around tables decked with Iceland
poppies and gum-tips.
Connie Smily wound a silver girdle
around snowy satin and borrowed her
mother’s Honiton lace veil to keep her
appointment with Gilbert Hollings-
worth at St. Mary’s, West Perth. Edna
Smily held the bouquet, wearing a
gold lace coatee over daffodil radio
satin, and Joan Thompson carried the
train in a Kate Greenaway frock of the
same shade, with a little mob cap to
match.
Lady Campion, wife of W.Ai’s ex-
Governor, has arrived in the Ormonde
to stay with her son and daughter-in-
iaw, Mr. and Mrs. Wilfrid Campion, at
Cottesloe.
Peggy, youngest chick of the W. J.
Butchers, of Perth and Nangetty station,
has given her promise to Barney Wood,
of Perth, son of the R. E. Woods, of
Toorak, Melbourne.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
There is quite a lull in social happen-
ings ; everyone seems to be saving up
for the arrival of the Duke. The idea
of debs, at the Lord Mayor’s Ball to
entertain the royal personage has been
squashed. It has been intimated also
from Government House that only his
Ex. is to choose partners for the royal
foxtrotter, so many hopes have been
dashed to the ground. Anyone residing
within half a mile of the city will be
able to turn off his electric light at the
meter while the Duke is in Adelaide, for
we are promised streets that will be
brighter than day.
Mayor Cain has put the job of deco-
rating the Town Hall into the hands of
Mrs. Frank Harcus. She has just
achieved a great success with the Chinese
scheme in the Exhibition Building in
connection with the Kuitpo fair. The
old willow-pattern story was carried out
almost life-size, with eloping couple,
irate papa, bridge, pagoda and real fir-
trees made blue and white for the occa-
sion.
After having completed their first
cruise of Spencer’s Gulf, the destroyers
Stuart and Voyager have come to anchor
at Port Adelaide. Captain Lilley and a
number of the officers were the guests of
knight Edward Lucas in a drive through
the hills, and many small parties were
also arranged for them. Lieut. Maxwell
Hole was host at a cocktail shivoo, held
in the captain’s cabin, for which the
destroyer’s chef had contrived some
wonderful drinks. Among the guests
were Lieut.-Commander and Mrs. Bur-
rell, Mr. and Mrs. H. S. Hudd, Mrs. J.
H. Gosse, H. Law Smith, J. E. Gosse,
and Sub-Lieut. Warwick Bracegirdle.
A dance to raise funds for the Junior
Red Cross Home at Henley Beach was
held in the Liberal Hall, North Terrace,
organised by a committee of the J.R.C.
girls. Red peach-blossom decorated, and
the supper-tables were arranged with
sweet-peas.
The military were well to the fore at
the Palais Royal when the Light Horse
Ball was held in aid of the Angorichina
Hostel. Pink and white peach-blossom
was featured in the decorations. His Ex.
and Lady Dugan were received by
Major W. E. H. Pascoe (one of the
committee). Lady Dugan was gowned
in black lace with yoke of silver lace.
Mayor Cain was there with his daugh-
ter, Mrs. H. Dunstan, the Acting-Mayor-
ess ; she wore jade-green chiffon with
circular frills. Margaret Pascoe pre-
sented Lady Dugan with a bouquet
when she reached the dais. Mrs. Pascoe
was in pink satin with trained effect.
The Queen’s College 0.8. A. held its
dance at Australia Hall. The president
(Dr. H. M. Fisher) and his wife re-
ceived the guests, Mrs. Fisher in cream
georgette, carrying a posy in gold and
brown, the college colors. Iceland
poppies, daffodils and marigolds and
bunches of balloons in the same tone
made the hall, cheery.
TASMANIA.
The Governor and Lady Clark put in
an appearance at the Masonic “at-home.”
Decorations were very extensive, and
there was a red carpet for the vice-regals
to walk on. The supper-room was done
all in pink of a shade highly becoming
to complexions.
The C.J.’s lady had a tea-party at the
Queen Mary Club, when she greeted her
guests wearing her favorite and becom-
ing brownish tones in frock and hat.
There was quite a roll-up. Red and white
japonica decked the reception-room.
King’s Meadows Golf Club ran a
dance in connection with the northern
championships, and golfers from all
parts enjoyed the fun. The big dining-
room of the clubhouse was cleared for
dancing and decorated with masses of
Japanese plum- and peach-blossom. Mrs.
H. S. Gray did the secretarial job.
Zencho’s Business College gave the
proceeds from its dance at the Continen-
tal to the Children’s Hospital. The
Lyceum Club’s rooms were used for
bridge in the interests of the same insti-
tution, and bridgeites and dancers joined
forces at the Continental for supper.
Miss Good, principal of the college, was
in red-and-white-printed silk, with waxed
ribbon sash.
Dr. and Mrs. C. W. G. Clark, Rich-
mond, engineered a very successful party
for daughter Hilda on the eve of her
marriage to Geoff Swan. The bride has
been entertained also by the tennis and
golf clubs of Richmond.
News comes from Eric Wariow-
Davies, Rhodes scholar for the Speck in
1932, that he has graduated with first-
class honors in the School of Engineer-
ing, Oxford.

An attractive smile must
depend on glistening, healthy
teeth. Many women forget
that fact until too late.
Breeders of show
dogs see that the
dog’s diet contains
plenty of minerals
and vitamins.
How an artist of a
century or more,
ago would depict
the tortures of
toothache.
AS everyone knows, the wildest de-
light of any true epicure in the dog
world is a huge, juicy bone. After
the meat is eaten, the bone itself is
chewed and chewed, and that, in the
opinion of many people, is one reason
why dogs have good teeth. Bones are
mainly composed of calcium and phos-
phorus, the same minerals which build
strong, hard teeth. Many believe that
the dog’s appetite for bones is merely
nature’s scheme for obtaining the
minerals needed.
Human beings should include an
abundance of mineral-containing foods
in their diet also. Milk, cod liver oil,
and cheese are especially rich in tooth-
and bone-building minerals and the
necessary vitamins.
Of course, chewing hard substances
like bone also exercises the dog’s gums
and keeps them healthy and may offer
one more explanation of a dog’s freedom
from tooth decay.
The active cause of decay in the
human • mouth, according to dental
authorities, is acid-producing bacteria.
These germs cause fermentation of the
food particles that remain on teeth and
under gums. In so doing, acids are
formed which start decay. The germs
which produce these acids live in the
coating of film which covers teeth. This
film forms after every meal. It creeps
into every tiny crevice. Film actually
glues germs to the teeth. For years we
have studied ways of removing film.
Recently a discovery was made in The
Pepsodent Company’s laboratories —a
new and different cleansing and polish-
ing material. This new material is twice
as soft and therefore a great deal safer
than the polishing material generally
used in tooth pastes.
This new cleansing material is con-
tained in Pepsodent Tooth Paste exclu-
sively. Because it is softer and therefore
safer, Pepsodent is looked upon as the
modern standard of safety in tooth
pastes. At the same time it stands un-
surpassed in removing film and polishing
enamel brilliantly.

Thoughtful Opening Bids.
BY DR. H. L. TONKIN.
A few years ago. when we were all
rather dazzled by the glitter of the forc-
ing two-bid, I suggested that, when hold-
ing a hand that looked like a force, one
should ask himself: ‘‘What is my next
bid if my partner is bound to respond
with two no-trumps?” This will be
lound .useful even to-day.
Although opening calls of one consti-
tute over 90 per cent, of bids made, I
know of no textbook which stresses the
idea of thinking a step ahead with a
hand offering alternative bids. The
learner is equipped with the honor-trick
table and some very useful information
on distribution, but he is not advised to
think forward before opening his mouth.
It is agreed that a five-card minor suit
should always be bid before a four-card
major, in order to show partner the dis-
tribution. Likewise, when holding the
two majors, if the hearts are longer we
bid them first. Besides telling about top
cards it is important to give your part-
ner some picture of suit lengths, but I
contend that there is a large number of
hands on which this has been overdone,
with the result that the bidding has been
pushed unreasonably high on the im-
portant second round. Take the follow-
ing deal: —
The teaching has always been to open
with the longer major suit, and show
the spades on the second round. I main-
tain that the hand is not strong enough
to justify this unless another half quick
trick is added. If partner answers two
clubs or two diamonds and you then bid
two spades, he is forced to prefer the
hearts at the three level. Should his
bid have been made on a minimum you
probably won’t get three hearts. Open
with one spade, and over his weak one
no-trump or minor two you, give him a
preference, one trick cheaper.
The same principle should hold when
the suits are of equal length, as here:
Before opening, think what response you
are likely to get. If you call one spade
and get an answer of two hearts, what
do you do next? On the other hand,
if your opening bid is one club, when
your partner responds with one heart
you are quite justified in calling one
spade, wishing to encourage him further
in the attempt to find a fit. It may be
urged in defence of the opening spade
call that, when you get a response of
two hearts, your next bid is two no
trumps, “as he must have something in
the diamonds.” Why must he? It is
easy to think of hundreds of hands on
which he would reply “one heart,” and
which contain no stopper in diamonds.
But, using the bidding suggested here, he
will be practically certain that you have
nothing in the diamond suit, and will
not guide the bidding into a hopeless
no-trump contract. That is, there will be
a suit contract, unless he holds the
threatening diamonds. Here is the hand
which was dealt opposite that given
above. Game was bid and made in
spades, though no-trumps would fail by
two tricks —five losers in diamonds and
the club ace.
As it happened, the bidding at another
table went thus: —
N. S.
IS 2H
2NT 3S
3NT —
South left it in three no-trumps, giving
as his reason that the repeat of no-
trumps by his partner, after his assist in
spades, implied at least an honor in
both minors, which would render the
contract safe. However, if the bidding
were conducted on the more thoughtful
lines 1 have advocated, it would be most
unlikely that two good players could
end in the wrong contract.
The Coming Inter-State Contest.
In Sydney we have been conducting
elimination matches with a view to aid-
ing the selectors.
After three nights of keen play, four
pairs remained in: Mrs. Rosich and Mr.
B. Flohm ; Miss Glynn-Smith and Mr.
H. Humphery ; Mr. J. Griffiths and Mr.
C. Cadwallader ; Mr. L. Basser and Mr.
H. Fisher-Webster. The second and the
third of these were finally chosen. The
women’s team consists of Mrs. Rosich,
Mrs. Johnston, Mrs. Greer, Mrs. Nathan
and Mrs. Millingen. Mr. J. A. Burke
accompanies the players as manager.
Maoriland Bridge.
I have had some interesting reports on
bridge in Maoriland from Mr. Arthur
Madigan, who has played the game in
various parts of the world. He tells me
that contract is making grfcat headway
there, that duplicate tournaments are
held in some of the private clubs in Wel-
lington, and that an association is being
formed. This is excellent news indeed,
and means a step further on the road to
regular inter-State contests. 1 should be
glad to have the names and addresses of
the office-bearers of the N.Z.B.A.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
J. (South Brisbane). —By this time
you will have received a reply from
the secretary, Sydney Bridge Club, re-
garding duplicate tournament technique.
The Queensland Bridge Association is
going strong. Get in touch with Mr.
Austin Lennon, Griffiths House, Queen-
street, Brisbane.
V. (Forbes, N.S.W.). —Before master-
ing the methods of play for “stick-ins”
and “squeezes”- one must' be able to
count up opponents’ hands pretty accu-
rately. In “Lenz on Bridge,” a number
of hands is given illustrating these
plays. The articles on “squeeze” play
by Mr. Rowley Adams were a remark-
ably good exposition.
M.McC. (Ballarat, Vic.). —In my
answers to other correspondents on the
same subject, I have stated my dislike
of artificial opening bids on at least two
grounds. They take into account only
top cards, forgetting the power of dis-
tribution ; and they waste a round of
bidding.
“Ely Lenz” (Bondi, N.S.W.). —In Aus-
tralia, 1 believe we have so far only
scratched the surface of the mine of pos-
sibilities for contract bridge. In Eng-
land, Europe and America, tremendous
progress has been made during the last
three years. I think we are at about the
stage they were at in 1931.
W. (Wollstonecraff, N.S.W.). —In
contract there are actually fewer conven-
tions than in whist as played 40 or 50
years ago—that is, if all the conventional
whist leads are taken into account.
K. (Armidale, N.S.W.). —There is
no doubt that Englishmen, as card
players, are quite as good as Americans.
The trouble lies in the fact that in their
war against conventions they have be-
come unreasonable, forgetting that in a
game like contract a player must have
some idea of what his partner means
when a bid is made.

An Amateur Views This Fine Art: —
The Art
of
Drinking
BY J. B. BLAIR.
THIS is an art of which I have little
first-hand knowledge. Not alto-
gether a natural art, like Eating, it
can be acquired only after long years
of practice and constant training, and
by those who are prepared to sink every-
thing in their devotion to its tenets.
My life has been too busy and my
time far too occupied to enable me to
give to the art that undivided attention
necessary to master it in all its intricacies.
My friend McQ., however, is a past-
master.
He has studied it in all its branches,
practised it at all times and in all places,
and can justly claim that there is no
aspect of the art, however small, that has
not enjoyed his undivided attention, and
no angle, however unusual, which he has
not completely mastered. To him, there-
fore, I am indebted for much of the
material for this treatise.
For myself, I have, of course, dabbled
in this as in many arts, but, realising that
complete mastery of it is beyond my
compass, I am content to sit at the feet
of the Master, to indulge in such simple
branches of it as appeal to my simple
tastes, and to leave the fullest and most
“Lo! The poor heathen with untutored
mind.”
exquisite enjoyment of its delights to
those better fitted to appreciate them.
McQ. has told me that geographical
accident is a great influencing factor in
the development of the art. The Eskimo,
for instance, knows nothing of the de-
lightful feeling of ice-cold beer trickling
down a parched throat, nor of the velvety,
seductive taste of the cocktail, preferring
to sell his soul, his wife or even his
season’s haul
of sealskins for
a can of train
oil.
“Lo! The
poor heathen
with untutored
mind!”
Again, the
Russian peas-
ant, secure for
th e moment
from the
watchful eye
of the village
Commissar, and safe
for the night from the
wolves, burns out his
throat with fiery vodka,
and would not give two
kopeks for the French-
man’s absinthe, far less
the sake of the Jap.
Vodka may be
blamed for Russian
literature, Russian fatalism and probably
for the Revolution. That liquor, instead
of elevating the mind and placing the
drinker on a lofty pinnacle whence he
may look down with feelings of sublime
benevolence upon his fellow-men, has
rather an opposite effect. It depresses.
It enables one to see one’s fellow-
creatures as they really are —a most dis-
couraging thing.
In this state of mind all Russian litera-
ture was conceived, and were it not for
vodka we should not have the ineffable
pleasure of reading how Ivan Ivanovitch
battered out with a samovar the small
modicum of brains possessed by his
mother, Martha Marthavitch, to save her
from ill-treatment at the hands of his
drunken father, Serge Serjevitch.
THE real aim in drinking is to achieve
a state of mind in which the drinker
sees his fellow-creatures, not as they
“....ethereal beings.”
really are, but as ethereal beings, brim-
ful of goodfellowship.
I make no plea for drunkenness. It
is inexcusable. A person who cannot
imbibe an unlimited quantity of alcoholic
beverages without becoming completely
non compos should not be allowed to
consume liquors which were obviously
made for his betters.
It should be borne in mind, however,
that an absolutely sober person is
seldom a fit judge of another man’s
sobriety, far less of the degree of his
inebrity. Feelings of jealousy and envy
enter too much into the scheme of things
to enable him to give an unbiased judg-
ment, and he may take quite a jaun-
diced view of a harmless and innocent
exhibition of happy jollity.
I have even erred myself.
’Twas New Year’s Eve, and 1 arrived
shortly after midnight at a party where
the sounds of revelry had'been heard for
several hours. 1 seated myself at a
corner table, and a feeling of nausea
came over me.
Were these creatures
actually civilised human
beings? Never, it seem-
ed to me, had I seen
such depraved - looking
women, such debauched
men. I shuddered.
But worse was to
come. Across the room,
seated at a table littered
like the rest with bottles,
were two whom I had
always regarded as my
closest friends. They
sagged across the table
like wet sacks. Not a
man in that hall but was
drunk, yet beside this
pair the most dissolute
of the others seemed as
sober as a Judge. They
looked as if they had
been drinking steadily
since the previous Easter,
changing their drinks every five minutes,
and as if they had slept in their clothes
since Guy Fawkes Day.
I turned away in disgust.
At the table next to me two young
bloods were chewing up wineglasses,
while a demure-looking flapper was
rapidly emptying a quart-bottle of whisky
through a straw. Something attracted me
towards her. She looked up.
“Have some?” she offered.
I hesitated a moment. The bottle was
still half-full. She seemed so young and
innocent —so different from the others.
If she drank the rest she would be hope-
lessly intoxicated.
My duty was plain. I couldn’t bear
the thought of seeing her in the same
condition as those other shameless
hussies. There was only one thing for
me to do.
I took the bottle and drained it to the
dregs.
The performance of this little act of
kindness made me feel a different man.
I felt that in helping this innocent crea-
ture I had done my good deed for the
“.... emptying a quart-bottle of whisky
through a straw.”
day—for New Year’s Day—and that I
could face the New Year with a light
heart.
I looked around.
THINGS seemed somehow different.
The dancers looked merry and gay,
those at the tables light-hearted and
happy, and those lying on the floor or
under the tables seemed peaceful and
comfortable. Even the wineglass-chew-
ers seemed to have some good points
about them. I was almost tempted to
have a bite or so myself.
In the corner I saw my two friends.
What jolly fellows they looked, happy,
fun-loving and brimful of good spirits.
“.... one’s little hilarities are looked
upon in their proper light.”
“Happy New Year!” they cried, and,
sweeping away a couple of dozen
empties, they made room for me, and

“THE ‘WILD CAT’ MONTHLY
Australia’s leading financial journal, enables him to do
this and other things.
September issue Now on Sale
the next few hours form one of the
pleasantest recollections of my life.
I merely quote this instance to show-
how easy it is to be mistaken.
TO those not versed in the art, and
. desirous of learning something of
its practice, a few words of advice might
be timely. The best way to master it,
of course, is in company with a few
companionable acquaintances. To such
as are prepared to adopt this method, 1
need offer no assistance. Their friends
will be only too pleased to initiate them.
It may be costly, but the experience will
probably be worth the price.
But there are many retiring souls who
shrink from displaying their ignorance
in public, and for this reason hesitate
to take the first step towards acquiring
efficiency in the art. Such persons who
prefer to practise in private will find the
following procedure handy.
The experimenter should take home a
dozen bottles or a small keg of beer, and
conceal it in the laundry, garage, wood-
shed or other handy repository. He
should then select a day when the
weather is warm to hot or cool to cold ;
preferably the day he takes the beer
home.
He should admit himself stealthily into
the laundry, woodshed, garage, etc.,
chosen, accompanied by a drinking vessel
of some kind. It may be of silver,
pewter, glass or any other suitable
material. The next step is to transfer
some of the beer into the glass.
The glass should be quite full. After
a time it should be quite empty. It
should then be full again, then empty,
and so on until the bottles are,empty or
the experimenter full, whichever hap-
pens first.
The ideal to aim at is the simultaneou
achievement of both these states.
OF course, tastes differ, and some may
prefer to conduct the experimeni
with wine, whisky or some other liquor
In this case, a smaller garage, fewer bottle,
and a smaller drinking vessel are recom
mended, the experimenter, of course,
being regarded as a constant. It is fairly
safe to regard him as this, because even
if he isn’t he soon will be.
The next step is to learn how to carry
one’s liquor like a gentleman. This is
fairly simple, as all that is necessary is
to dress reasonably well and look fairly
well off.
In such circumstances one’s little hil-
arities are looked upon in their proper
light as merely jovial exhibitions of high
spirits and light-headedness.
If, however, one allows oneself to be
come shabby and careless of dress, it is
only natural that such hilarities will be
misconstrued into disorderly and offen-
sive conduct, and one may find oneseli
in the court on Monday morning charged
with being “as drunk as a lord.”
The careful experimenter will bear thi
well in mind, but to be on the safe side
he should lock the garage and throw
the key out the window.
I AM not overlooking the fact that there
may be teetotallers who do not wish
to acquire any knowledge of the art.
Far be it from me to attempt to persuade
them from their course. After all, I am
a teetotaller myself, in everything but
practice.
A Vivid Story of Character Conflict: —
REPARATION.
By- FRANK WALFORD.
“You wish me to be the victim on
the altar of your belated remorse. To
salve your awakened conscience, you
wish to play fairy godfather to the poor
half-caste. Is that so ?”
HIS mail neatly ranged on
’ his table, Mr. Domar-
esque, general manager of
the Australasian Commerce and
Trade Banking Co., Ltd., sat in his
office. Behind him a large electric
fan stirred the hot air into waves of cool-
ness. They beat down on his head and
neck unnoticed ; he had ceased to take
stock of the present.
His mind had journeyed backward to
an incident which had happened thirty
years before. He was a man of single
ideas, and just now his thoughts were in
the past. So the letters lay unopened on
his table, the whirring fan churned the
air unheeded, and two important deposi-
tors cooled their heels in the waiting-
room.
Thirty years ago! He had just been pro-
moted to the office of branch accountant
in the central-west of Queensland.
No longer was he compelled to handle
cash from the opening to the closing of
the bank, and waste his afternoons hang-
ing about while other men balanced their
books. He ranked next to the manager.
The tellers were his juniors. His time
was much his own. It was not even
necessary to wait while the ledgers and
daybooks were posted and added. When
the bank closed at 3 p.m. he could slip
away, returning in time to see how the
balance had fared. Thirty years ago!
He sighed and stared aimlessly at the
wall.
Suddenly he opened a drawer in his
office table and extracted a weekly news-
paper. It was a ribald sheet, notorious
for the frankness with which it retailed
scandal; scarcely the type of paper one
would expect to discover in the office of
the general manager of a big trading
bank. With automatic certainty he
opened it. Staring at him from the
centre of the page was an Australian
aboriginal.
Mr. Domaresque wiped his forehead
with his handkerchief, and turned to the
letterpress. He skipped the references to
the attainments of Mr. Jimmy Murrundi.
He already knew them by heart. He
was aware that the man had been edu-
cated at a Catholic mission station ; that
he had passed onward to Brisbane Uni-
versity with an exhibition ; that he had
graduated first of his year in Arts, with
an enviable record of prizes and honors.
He was aware that the famous aboriginal
was at present engaged on a lecturing
tour. These things were common know-
ledge. His concern lay with matters of
more intimate relation.
The fact that Murrundi was not a full-
blooded aboriginal had been suppressed
by his publicity managers. The admix-
ture of white blood, if known to his audi-
ences, undoubtedly would detract from
his drawing powers. Knowing the psy-
chology of their crowds, his managers
also were careful to describe him as
“Mr.” Murrundi. In a continent where
natives are known by their given names
the prefix distinguished him from his
kinsmen even more than his intellectual
attainments.
These facts were exposed in the news-
paper, but they possessed little more at-
traction for Mr. Domaresque than the
academic accomplishments. He scanned
lightly through the brutal recountal until
he reached the place where it dealt with
the genesis of the famous lecturer. At
this point his interest became intense.
THE telephone on his table jangled
harshly, and was ignored. The neat
array of letters remained undisturbed.
One of the waiting commercial mag-
nates already had departed in disgust.
The other had taken to frequent inspec-
tions of his watch. But the general man-
ager of the Australasian Commerce and
Trade Banking Co., Ltd., was oblivious
of the duties attending his office. His
mind had been transported thirty years
into the past.
“Jimmy’s mother,” he read, “was a
full-blooded lubra of a mission station.
Who his father was probably never will
be known ; but the man’s features betray
unquestionable evidence of Caucasian
blood. Our special investigator reports
that certain Old Hands remember when
the gin gave birth to the boy who later
was to achieve such fame. There was a
fairly unanimous belief at the time, they
declare, that his father was a young bank
official who to-day occupies a particu-
larly high place in financial circles. How-
ever that may be, it is certain that some
white man seduced the little mission girl,
and in the most cowardly manner left
her to shoulder the consequences of his
‘amusement.’ As the world is the richer

Pyjama 22/11
by Jimmy Murrundi, he can be forgiven,
though nothing palliates his depravity,
cowardice and selfishness.”
There was more of it, but Mr. Dom-
aresque had ceased reading. He dropped
the paper on the floor, where its leaves
rustled and lifted before the waves of
air driven outward from the revolving
fan. When the chief messenger entered,
alter having knocked fruitlessly several
imes, he discovered the general man-
ager with his head in his hands and his
elbows on the table.
He coughed gently. Finding his pres-
ence unnoticed, he coughed loudly.
“Are you unwell, sir?”
Mr. Domaresque lifted his head and
immediately became his customary self,
cold, formal and aloof.
“Just a sudden shooting pain in the
head, Montgomery. Is there anyone in
the waiting-room?”
The messenger glanced at the pile of
unopened letters, and wondered. Then
he dismissed conjecture as beyond the
ambit of his duty.
“Yes, sir. Mr. Ellis, of the Amalga-
mated Transport Company, is waiting,
Mr. Gwynne-Jones was there for a while,
but went away. He said he would call
to-morrow.”
Mr. Domaresque nodded.
“ C i „ tjTi; • „ , , ,
SHOW Mr- Ellis in, he commanded,
and began opening his mail with a silver-
handled paper-knife.
T UA t, . ..
HAT evening Mi. Jimmy Murrundi
sat . Itbe et *B e of h/s bed in a
lashionable hotel wrinkling his nose over
a visiting-card which the hall-boy had
brought him. He had heard of Mr.
Domaresque, but could imagine no
reason for the visit. Faintly curious, he
descended to the private sitting-room,
where he found his visitor brooding over
the oak-table surface.
“Don’t trouble to rise,” said Mur-
rundi, pulling a chair across. “I under-
stand you wish to see me.”
Mr. Domaresque nodded. “That is so.
I wish to see you on a certain private
matter.”
Murrundi raised his brows. "We are
quite private here,” he declared. “No
one will enter while we’re present.”
Mr. Domaresque sat hunched in his
chair, apparently in difficulty how to
open. Suddenly he looked up, straight-
ener i himself and inhaled deeply.
“The fact is, Mr. Murrundi, I have
come to see you on a matter of rather
an—er—intimate, not to say delicate,
nature. My position is extremely difficult,
and I want you to help me out as far
as possible. If I begin by asking certain
questions which will seem very imper-
tinent, I ask you to bear with me. Be-
lieve me, I’m no busybody attempting to
P r y into y° ur P riva te affairs. There is
the gravest reason for all 1 may say.
Shall I proceed?”
Murrundi extracted a seasoned briar
from his pocket. “Do you mind my
smoking?” he inquired. “My tobacco is
rather strong, a vice inherited from my
race.”
Mr. Domaresque winced at the allu-
? i( ? n - , “Smoke, . b y aII means," he en-
joined. 1 m a pipe-smoker myself. Like
tobacco is not exactly mild,
but , sha ,| „ ot smoke ti| , rve f ln j shcd
wha t , have , Q say „
Silently he watched Murrundi fill his
pj pe> jjght it with a safety match and
pi ace the stub tidily in an ashtray. He
employed this interlude to study the
powerful face. Then he met the other’s
eyes, and realised that he was waiting
patiently.
“I beg your pardon,” said Mr. Dom-
aresque. “The truth is—er—that is to
say” He ended in confusion and
relapsed into his chair. Almost imme-
diately he drew himself upright again,
brushing a hand nervously across his
forehead, and began fidgeting with two
fingers in the pocket of his waistcoat.
“I scarcely know how to begin,” he
admitted with a twisted smile. Then
abruptly, “Have you seen ‘The Weekly
Aeon’?”
The other nodded, watching him in-
tently.
“Is what it states true?”
Murrundi shrugged. “I don’t see
why I should deny it. Substantially, it is
true.”
“Ah! Your mother’s name was”
“Nelly. To the best of my knowledge
she had no other.”
“Quite so. And you were born to-
wards the end of 1904?”
“December 9, 1904, so I always have
understood,”
“The actual date is immaterial. I
merely wished to place it approxi-
mately.”
Again the bank manager was silent.
For some minutes he sat aimlessly pick-
ing at his waistcoat with long, nervous
fingers.
Murrundi took the pipe from his
mouth and leaned forward. “Would
it be impertinence' on my part to ask the
meaning of this catechism?” he asked.
MR. DOMARESQUE blinked as one
who has been awakened from an
unpleasant dream. Then he shook his
head slowly. “You have every right
in the world to ask,” he admitted, “for
it is beyond doubt that I am your
father.”
“Ah!” The lecturer sucked in his
breath noisily. Instantly he was impas-
sive, and carefully forced the ash down
in the bowl of his pipe before returning
it to his mouth.
The seconds grew into minutes while
the two men sat in silence, Mr. Doma-
resque nervously fingering his vest and
the other smoking imperturbably.
“Well?” asked the bank manager at
length.
Murrundi emitted a downward puff of
smoke, and two thin spirals trickled
from his nostrils. “I might echo that
exclamation,” he commented. “Well?”
Mr. Domaresque hesitated. “Yes,” he
admitted, “the right to make inquiries
is on your side. Is there anything you
wish to know?”
Murrundi shook his head. “Nothing. ’
“You are not curious?”
“Why should I be curious about the
actions of a cur who seduced a black
gin?”
Mr. Domaresque flushed. “I suppose
1 deserve that. I admit that my action
was inexcusable. The sole palliation is
my extreme youth at the time. How-
ever,. I’ve come here in all honesty, with
the intention of repairing my fault to
the extent of my ability. After all, you
are my son and I intend to do what I can
on your behalf.”
Murrundi took his pipe in the crook
of his forefinger and gazed at his father.
“You have left it rather late in the day
to try to make amends, haven’t you?
I will be thirty years of age in a few
weeks. Why this sudden anxiety for my
welfare now that I am a grown man and
well able to look after myself?”
Mr. Domaresque huddled in his chair
and raised tired eyes. He felt old and
a little out of his depth. He realised
that, while his steel might strike fire
from the cold flint before him, it was
powerless to do more. He had dealt
with men too long not to recognise
character when he encountered it. There
was disconcerting strength in this strange
product of his loins.
“As I said,” he commented, “my task
is exceedingly difficult. I was hoping
that you would not make it more diffi-
cult. It is only twenty-four hours since
1 learned, through that scurrilous news-
paper, that you were my son. You see,
I did not even suspect that I had a son.”
Murrundi stood, pocketing his pipe.
“Naturally,” he said brutally. “You
had had what men of your type style
your ‘fun.’ The incident over, you did not
trouble about possible consequences to
the more innocent party to your amuse-
ment. Why should you, a white man,
bother about the fate of a black gin?
Why should you have qualms that pos-
sibly your own child was knocking
about a blacks’ camp? What did all
this matter to you? You seduced a
miserable gin. She was fair game, and
as far as you were concerned it ended
there. Naturally, decency or ethics don’t
invade the philosophy of young men of
the type which you undoubtedly were.
Get the utmost out of life and damn
the other fellow! That’s the creed of
your class, and from your point of view
rather an admirable creed.”
“But surely you don’t deny the right
to rectify the errors of youth! I ask
you to believe that I am in deadly
earnest. Were it otherwise —well, I
would not be here.”
He laughed nervously.
MURRUNDI studied him for a
moment, then nodded his head
slowly. “There is something in your
contention. What do you suggest?”
“Well, I might be able to assist you
in some way. I am rather a power in
the financial world. If, by any means
in my power, I can”
Murrundi interrupted without cere-
mony. “I don’t need financial aid,
thank you. I am quite capable of earn-
ing my own living. I am by way of
being a freak —an Australian nigger who
holds an Arts degree and has a lucra-
tive lecturing connection. Oh! I realise
only too well that it’s neither my won-
derful intellect nor my wonderful ora-
tory which brings capacity houses; it is
the fact that I am a freak. They crowd
to listen to me and gaze at me just as
they crowd to the Zoo to gaze at the
monkeys and listen to the lions roaring.
I am a kind of super-clown, amusing
the multitude. It has its humorous
moments, I can assure you, notably
when I am patronised by some igno-
ramus with nothing to commend him
but a colossal conceit and an assured
position. It is amusing, and it provides
me with a generous income. Just let
me give you an insight into my earning
capacity. I owe everything that lam to
a Catholic mission which took me in
as a babe, reared me, taught me, fed
me and clothed me. To-day I am an
uncompromising atheist; but eadh
Christmas I donate 20 per cent, of nfy
year’s earnings to that mission as a
slight return for what it did for me. This
year my contribution will exceed £5OO.
So you see that I am not in very great
need of financial assistance ... even
from a suddenly discovered father.”

Mr. Domaresque fingered his waist-
coat. “I see that,” he conceded. “I see
it plainly. Still, I think you have failed
to get my point. As your father, I wish
to do something for you personally.”
Murrundi laughed. “In other words,
you wish me to be the victim on the
altar of your belated remorse. To salve
your awakened conscience, you wish to
play fairy godfather to the poor half-
caste. Is that so? If so, I can assure
you that you must seek farther for the
sacrifice. May I make a suggestion
which possibly will help you out of
your trouble? Why not hunt out other
little half-castes and give them a chance
in life? Why trouble about the parti-
cular one who is in least need of your
attentions?”
Mr. Domaresque scratched his nose
thoughtfully. “I am prepared to do
that, or its equivalent. I am prepared to
donate an annual sum to this mission
which you subsidise so generously.”
Again Murrundi interrupted the older
man. “I do not regard it as generosity,
rather as a solemn due from one whom
it rescued from the horrors of mental
darkness.”
Mr. Domaresque nodded agreement.
“I rather fancy I would regard my own
contribution in the same light. Still,
that is not what I am seeking. It is my
ardent wish to do something tangible
for you, my son. Can you suggest any-
thing?”
Deliberately Murrundi gazed straight
into his father’s eyes. “Yes,” he said
slowly, “I can suggest one thing. I
suggest, if you honestly wish to make
amends, that you acknowledge me be-
fore the world as your son, accept me
in your home on a son’s footing, and
introduce me as such to your friends . .
and to my brothers and sisters. Are you
sincere enough in your remorse to
accept the suggestion?”
THE banker hesitated, and Murrundi
laughed harshly. “Don’t trouble to
reply in words,” he exclaimed. “You
already have answered to my satisfac-
tion. You would not dare do it. You
haven’t the guts. My stepmother would
object. Forgive me if ‘stepmother’ is
not a felicitous term. My brothers and
sisters would rebel. Your friends would
erase your name from their visiting lists.
Your clubs would expel you. In short,
the sacrifice would entail too much per-
sonal inconvenience. Your contrition
does not go quite as deep as all that.”
He waved the white man down
peremptorily as he essayed to speak.
“Let me finish, please. Then you may
say what you will. I wish to add this:
in no circumstances would T know-
ingly enter the house of the man who
seduced my mother—black gin though
she may have been—and left her and
her child to the world. The only white
men whom I respect are the good
brothers of the mission which cared for
me and a university professor who went
out of his way to guide me and make
my lot pleasant when I was an under-
graduate. The rest may go to hell by
their own route.”
“By God! you’re bitter,” exclaimed
Mr. Domaresque. “What has happened
to make you so bitter?”
The black’s nostrils dilated. “What
has happened? I should think you’d be
the last to ask that question. You might
go home and ask yourself how you
would have developed in circumstances
similar to mine. No, thank you, my
father. You may keep your miserable
and indefinite dole ; you, who lack the
moral courage to acknowledge our re-
lationship openly. We dwell on dif-
ferent planes. We possess different di-
mensions. We have nothing in common,
save that my mother was your whore.
The last fact is between you and her, or
between you and your troublesome con-
science. Personally, I cannot acknow-
ledge any relationship with the cur who
seduced her. Now, if you will excuse
me, I must get into my dress things. I
am dining with the Governor to-
night ... at his club!’*
“Wait!” Mr. Domaresque lifted an
admonitory hand. Then, while the other
stared in amazement, he crossed to his
side and laid it gently on his shoulder.
The gesture was almost a caress. “Sup-
posing,” he inquired, “that I asked you
to take your rightful place in my home
as my son. Would that alter your
attitude?”
“I could not answer that question until
the proposition had been put to me.”
Mr. Domaresque smiled. “Consider
it put, then. I definitely make the offer.”
M URRUNDI walked across to the
■ mantelpiece. He stood leaning
against it for a moment, sunk in thought.
Then he flung his head back and re-
turned to his father, who was watching
him steadily.
“Am I to have an established place in
your home?”
“Yes.”
“As your acknowledged son?”
“Yes.”
A gleam of humor flickered in the
black’s eyes, and was succeeded by
something plaintively whimsical.
“Mr. Domaresque.” he said quietly,
“by that offer you have wiped a great
deal off the slate. I appreciate just
what it must have cost you, but 1 pay
you the tribute of believing you to have
been sincere. Nevertheless, I must
decline. I think I prefer my father to
remain anonymous. If I strutted through
the world as the byblow of a well-known
banker, it would make me even more
of a penny peepshow that at present.
Also it would occasion you lasting bitter-
ness and disgrace, and in all probability
alienate you from your family. I have
managed fairly well for thirty years
without either a father or a home, and
it is somewhat late in the day to think
about acquiring them. In case you
may feel disposed to offer up thanks
for my refusal, I wish to make it per-
fectly clear that it is inspired more by
regard for my own feelings than for
yours. I’m hard, toughened in a world
which has given me little pleasure and
plenty knocks. 1 have survived, and pos-
sibly am the better for them, but I have
no desire to court knocks deliberately.
To be installed in your home, in such
circumstances, would produce them in
abundance. As I have cultivated the
habit of repaying all knocks with
interest, life might not be too pleasant
for any of us. So I decline your offer
without thanks. You are at perfect
liberty to be as grateful as you please
for my refusal.”
Mr. Domaresque sighed, more with
relief than regret. “Will you shake
hands?” he asked, almost shyly.
“With pleasure, sir.”
Murrundi smiled broadly as they
gripped hands. “Don’t take me too seri-
ously,” he advised. “I am so accustomed
to being patronised that I have grown
like an echidna, erecting my quills the
moment I am approached. There is
another thing. I am not a family man.
There is more of the nigger in me than
shows in the skin. I would never be
happy in that house of yours. Neither
would you, while I was there. Now, I
really must rush off and dress in readi-
ness for the Governor’s dinner. Good-
bye, sir.”
“Not exactly good-bye,” said Mr.
Domaresque. “Would you have dinner
with me to-morrow night?”
“At your club?”
“No. At my home.”
“As your son?”
“Again no. I’m sure my wife and
family will be delighted to meet Mr.
Jimmy Murrundi, the famous lecturer.
How about it, Jimmy?”
Family Piece.
The wind fumbles at the door
And rattles the sashes,
Drops hiss down the wide chimney, and the
ashes
Heap up in tinkling drifts of pearl and rose.
The room is a dim-arched cave
Where the firelight flows
Like golden water.
Each one of us sits,
Absorbed, complacent, grave,
Intent on something.
Agatha, low on the sagging sofa, knits,
The scarlet wool looping her fingers
In a subtle question-mark.
Elise (her head a halo) scans her book,
Reading with an innocent, still look
Of nymphs and satyrs.
A paper rustles with the sound
Of crisp, dead leaves wind-lifted;
And petals fall from the yellow poppies
That have bunched their silk on city barrows.
Someone striking a live match mutters:
“Hark to the rain in the gutters
Like quarrelling sparrows!”
And mother sits back (delicately scorning
The fire-warmed circle)
Cutting up melons absurdly patterned,
Melons that smell as cold and green as the sea
On an autumn morning.
Warm, rich light on the broken fender,
Feet on the ink-stained mat!
Everything here is sweet and tender,
Lapped in the peace of home.
Only the cat,
Stirring suddenly with eyes agleam,
Stalks proudly to the door,
Remembering the wet, wild world outside,
And the dim, lost jungle-land he roved in
dream.
VICTORIA.
MYRA MORRIS.
The Shadow of a Tree.
The spring comes late to us. Though in the
ground
The sun has sent to bulbs and secret roots
The electric word, the telegraph of fire,
And now the pale, minutely-screeching shoots
Begin their agony upwards to delight
In that hareem the bee so clumsily loots;
And (hough within the sluggish limbs of trees
Now slowly crawls the leaf-life’s burning
thread,
Though ewes now know their sagging bellies
soon
No more will be so strangely tenanted,
The spring comes late to us; and many a man
Before the time of singing will be dead.
The children are merry, true, red flurrying
leaves,
But the men and I gulp beer and find it sour,
And heavily trudge to homes as cold and eerie
As mountain trees that under their snow-load
cower.
And midst the people Ngaire wanders palely
As listless as the hush before a shower,
No more to them, and hardly more to me
Than a premonition of rain, a tree’s shadow,
The softly moving shadow of a tree.

A Light Tale of a Severe Testing: —
MATES.
BY VICTOR KENNEDY.
“ ‘Rather decent bit of horseflesh, that,’
Dick said.
“ ‘Which ?’ / jerked back. ‘Your dead
cert. ?'
“‘Aw, chew your shirt!’ he snorted.”
PERHAPS it was because no one else
would listen to the Old-timer that
he insisted upon giving me the
advantage of his garnered experiences.
The weather was hot, dry and dusty,
and we were seated outside the bar on
the verandah, the Old-timer hunched
up on the edge with his back to one of
the posts.
“But that’s nothing,” he said apropos
of something he had been complaining
about. “This weather makes me think
of the last time I was in these parts,
thirty year ago or more. It wasn’t the
place it is now by long chalks, nor
Sydney neither; and Randwick has
grown respectable-like, too, these times.
The weather was just the same as this,
and the beer—well; beer was beer in
them days ; least, we put more of it away.
Still, pots were only threepence a time.”
IJ E took a long pull at his second
pot.
“Anyway, I was going to tell you
about the best pot I ever drank. Me
and Dick Withers had been down and
got busted at Randwick —clean skinned
of all we had a chance of earning in
the next month. We thought we were
going to return home in hansom cabs,
but instead there we were trudging home
to Missenden-road on foot—damned
sore feet, too, by the time we got there.
That’s where the pot came in.
“After the race Dick looked at me, and
1 looked back at him, but neither of us
spoke. He was always sure of himself,
was Dick, but he didn’t seem so sure then
as he did the week before when he was
talking about his dead cert. We turned
off together naturally for Newtown, as
though that was just the thing we did
every night after office hours, except that
we had no offices. Dick scratched along
pretty well on a store cart in them days,
and I was just filling in at a bit of
waggon painting.
“We were not too flush at the best of
times, and my boots were cracked about
a bit, too ; I looked down and noticed
that Dick’s were not much better. When
we got away from the crowd and the
cabs had thinned out, we both began to
think of the steady tramp ahead, and it
soured our tempers a bit, I think. It
must have been that, because I remember
thinking that Dick’s horse knowledge
wasn’t any better than mine. One passed
in a cab, and, by way of breaking the
monotony, I suppose, Dick said:
“ ‘Rather decent bit of horseflesh that.’
“ ‘Which?’ I jerked back. ‘Your dead
cert.?”
“ ‘Aw, chew your shirt,’ he snorted.
‘lf you had any opinions about it before
I didn’t hear them. You’re a squealer,
that’s all. If the thing had come home
you would have kidded yourself on your
knowledge of how to do things.’
“I pocketed that, as there may have
been something in it. But Dick was
wearing thin himself, and when I made
some reference to the dust being pow-
dery for this time of the year he snaps
back:
“ ‘Yes? It’ll be a damned sight drier
than this when the winter rains set in
properly.’
“Well, I thought, here’s a go, and on
we went again. There was a number of
tiny pebbles in my boots by this time,
and walking was not the happiest for
either of us. I had a threepenny-bit in
my pocket, and every time I felt it it
seemed to be bigger and smoother. I
could have got a lift of some sort for
that, but it wouldn’t do both of us. So
I kept silent about it; Dick would have
told me to get a lift for myself, even
though he was in a bad mood. Likewise,
it would be useless to offer it to him.
Mates was mates in them days.”
THE Old-timer took another pull at
the mug.
“So on we got. We had passed out
into Redfern, and were still silent when
we left Golden Grove behind and turned
into Newtown-road. I tried to break
the silence once or twice, but Dick either
didn’t hear or he was thinking about
something else ; although by the time we
reached King-street the air seemed to
be lighter. The old Daniel Lambert
stood on the corner of' King-street and
Missenden-road, and by the time we had
reached it we were both a bit freer,
perhaps because we were nearing home.
“Passing the Danny Lambert I thought
of my threepence again ; I wanted bad
to ask Dick to come in and have a
drink, but the blasted thing would only
buy one pot. In fact, I had thought of
it several times coming along the road ;
if it was only two threepenny-bits it
would have saved a lot of bad temper.
Dick’s eyes went into the Danny Lam-
bert, too, as we passed, like if they
wanted to bore through the door-screen.
Anyway, we finished the journey in some-
thing like cheerfulness.
“We were batching together at the
time, and when we got home Dick disap-
peared into his room at once, tired of
my company for a time, I thought. But
I still had my threepence.
“I collared a jug from the kitchen,
and sneaked out to the back of the
Danny Lambert threepenn’orth of
draught would clear the air, anyway ;
Dick couldn’t help but share a pot at
home. I never see a pot frothing over
like that one did ; you did get beer in
them days.”
THE Old-timer paused to take another
long pull at his fourth pot, then
rambled on.
“Yes, frothing over and cold. I could
hardly wait till I got home. Still, I got
in at the back door, and just had time
to plank my jug down on the table when
in comes Dick through the front pass-
age. And he had a frothing jug in his
hand, too. He stared at me and me at
him, both of us rather sheepish-like.
Then he says:
“ ‘I thought you were having a wash,
so I sneaked out to the front of the
Danny Lambert. I had a threepenny-
bit all day, but I knew it was no use
offering it to you for a lift or anything,
and I knew you wouldn’t share it coming
along. So I just waited till we got
home.’
“I pointed to my jug,” continued the
Old-timer, “and just said, stupid-like,
‘Me, too.’ Yes, mates was mates thirty
year ago—and beer was beer, too.”

WORMS
A COMMON COMPLAINT WITH
CHILDREN.
HOW TO TREAT IT.
Worms, by their movements and the
interruption they offer to the contents
of the Bowels, generally occasion pain
or uneasiness in the Abdomen, some-
times spasmodic, sometimes gnawing and
biting, and not infrequently of a vague,
indescribable character, and yet very dis-
tressing. Sympathetic with this is a sen-
sation of itching at the nostrils, producing
a disposition to pick the Nose, which is
characteristic of the affection. The
Bowels are often disordered, sometimes
relaxed, as in Dysentery. The appetite
is exceedingly variable ; in some cases
natural, in others deficient, craving or
depraved, one condition-mot infrequently
alternating with another. The Abdomen
is often hard, swollen and tympanetic,
the breath heavy and foetid, and tongue
furred, with disagreeable taste, and a
copious flow of saliva; swelling of the
upper lip, bleeding of the nostrils and
disposition to grind the teeth during the
sleep are other characteristic symptoms.
The effects, however, often extend be-
yond the Alimentary Canal, and various
derangements of health are experienced
in consequence, either of the direct irri-
tation of the worms or of the disordered
digestion which they occasion.
Unfortunately, many mothers fail to
recognise the fact that their little ones
have worms, are suffering intense pain
and distress, and are practically irre-
sponsible for the outbursts of temper,
restlessness and peevishness, and until
some more serious symptoms appear
nothing is done to alleviate the distress.
The symptoms of this disease are some-
what variable, but generally they are so
characteristic that no mother need have
any doubts. The best proof of worms is
worms, and if the general conduct of the
child is such as to give the slightest sus-
picion a careful watch will afford ample
proof.

Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are a purely vegetable medicinal pre-
paration, compounded on a scientific
principle for the eradication of worms
which infest the Intestines. They contain
specific properties which destroy the
worms but cause no injury to the
Stomach or Bowels, and do not weaken
the system. The pellets are prepared in
the form of a confection or lolly, have
no disagreeable taste or smell, but, on the
contrary, inspire children to take them
as they would an ordinary sweet.
Obtainable at all Chemists and Stores,
or direct from the W. H. Comstock Co.,
Ltd., 23 Lang Street, Church Hill,
Sydney. Price 2/- per box (6 boxes
11/6), post free.

SHEEPSKINS FOR BOOKBINDING
Instead of casing its books in orthodox cloth binding, The Endeavour
Press has tested the possibility of using tanned Australian sheepskins
for the purpose. The result is a remarkable credit to local crafts-
manship. A special autographed and numbered edition of Brian
Penton’s “Landtakers” has been produced in this richly unique bind-
ing. Specimen books can be viewed in Sydney at Dymock s, David
Jones’s book counter, Moore’s Book Shop and Preece s Book Shop.
As the edition is confined to 23 copies only, all first impressions, it.
will doubtless be a source of interest to collectors of limited and
special editions. The price is two guineas each, and Bulletin readers
who would like to procure one of these valuable books should write
to any of the above retail shops or direct to
The Endeavour Press, 252 George Street,
Sydney.
