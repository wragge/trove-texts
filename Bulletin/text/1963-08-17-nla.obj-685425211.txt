National Notebook
Perfect Peace
Tt is perhaps unfair to criticise the new
ABC “Four Corners” team, Allan
Ashbolt and Gerald Lyons, before they
have had a chance to get going, but after
looking at the programme on peace
movements, we wondered if anyone were
really ingenuous enough to imagine that
peace committees were necessarily, or
sometimes at all, concerned with peace.
Tasmanian Dry Red
Licensing Bill now before the
-*■ Tasmanian Parliament specifically
provides for commercial development of
the State’s first vineyard in more than a
century.
Grapes were grown for winemaking
at Mowbray, now a suburb of Laun-
ceston, in the 1830 s. Cuttings from the
vines were used to set up vineyards in
Victoria, but the Tasmanian industry was
apparently not significant ancf cfid not
survive.
Three years ago, J. F. Miguet, a
Frenchman with wide experience of wine-
growing in his native country, began ex-
perimental growing of vines at Lilydale
which lies in the hills about 20 miles
north-east of Launceston. Mr Miguet is
now satisfied that he can produce good
wine, and produce it economically.
He can please himself as a grower, but
not as a seller of the wine he produces.
The Act provides for the licensing of
breweries, wholesalers and hotels, but it
has no provision for viticulturists, and
Mr Miguet cannot legally dispose of his
wine.
The amended legislation will enable
him to sell to hotels or merchants. If any
of his dry red escapes the attention of
fiercely patriotic Tasmanians, it could be
an intriguing one to spring on mainland
wine-lovers.
Tearing A Strip
Around the publicity department of
Twentieth Century Fox in Sydney
these days no one ever mentions
strippers. The film “The
Stripper,” starring Joanne
Woodward, was released
in Sydney a few weeks
ago, but business was as
bare as Miss Woodward’s
midriff and the film was
quickly withdrawn.
It seems Miss Woodward and hus-
band Paul Newman are now tearing
strips off Fox for allowing the film to
be saddled with that “awful name” and
have stated they are not making any
more films for Fox. What particularly
upsets them is that they made this clear
before the film was released.
In New York the film was shown as
“A Woman in July” and in London as
“A Woman of Summer,” doing good
business in both places. The Sydney
office of Fox obviously thought “The
Stripper” would have more appeal in
their fair city. We wonder why!
Snow for Melbourne
LAne morning last week Melbourne was
” just below freezing point at 7 am,
while inland at Ballarat and Mildura
ground temperatures as low as 13 degrees
were recorded. This was just what was
needed for Victoria’s first attempt at arti-
ficial snow-making. Backed by the Eil-
don Chamber of Commerce, a hardy
group of engineers set up a £5OOO
snow-making machine near Mt Torbreck,
and succeeded in spraying a fine powdery
snow over an area of several hundred
square feet. The machine forces water
and air through nozzles at high pressure
to form a mi|t. If the temperature is
below freezing point—as it was this
morning—the mist freezes and falls as
snow. The machine costs about £2 an
Getting It Both Ways
Tf the review of Morris West’s “The
Shoes of the Fisherman” in this
week’s issue of the Communist “Tri-
bune” is the party line on his works,
then West should soon be earning as
many roubles as Frank Hardy. The
book is highly praised by “Tribune's”
reviewer, who says it was “savagely
mauled by capitalist press critics, not
one of whom, to my knowledge, has even
mentioned its main themes the need
for peaceful co-existence and the need
for the Church to adapt itself to a world
in which Communism has become a
major force.”
Of course, the reviewer points out that
West’s viewpoint that the main ideo-
logical conflict in the modern world is
between Catholicism and Communism is
“distorted”. “Communists are not strug-
gling against Catholicism or against any
religion but against capit-
alism,” the reviewer points
out.
Although West does
not get a clean bill of
health, ideologically, there
is no complaint about the
fact that West’s Pope
Kiril was held prisoner in the Com-
munist Kamenev’s country for 17 years
and tortured and beaten. That sort of
thing is obviously taken by “Tribune” as
all in the day’s forced march.

fiour to run and the type of snow pro-
duced can be controlled. Wet snow is
used to build up a base on the ground
and this is topped off with a layer of
dry snow for ski-ing.
The Eildon people are keen to develop
Mt Torbreck as a ski resort. There is
usually snow up to four feet deep high
up on the mountain, but it tends to peter
out on Barnewall Plains, half-way down
the mountainside. The idea is to cover
this area with man-made snow, using sev-
eral machines similar to the one tested
last week. Mt Torbreck is only 86 miles
from Melbourne and Barnewall Plains
can be reached in two hours by car. If
Eildon can carry through its plans, this
would be the most accessible snow-field
in Australia to city-dwellers. With water-
sports on the reservoir in the summer, it
would make Eildon an all-the-year holi-
day area.
Petition
the ABC news service, Northern
A Territorians have been told that a
petition inscribed on a bark painting has
been sent to the Prime Minister, Sir
Robert Menzies, on the vexed question
of bauxite mining on the Gove penin-
sula, on the extreme eastern end of
Arnhem Land. Around the north, the
announcement has been received with
a mixture of incredulity and hilarity.
According to the news item, aborigines
of the Yirrkala tribes had inscribed their
petition on a bark painting in their own
language, with a translation into English,
and it was hoped the petition would
reach the Federal Parliament. Contents
of the petition are said to have been
compiled by the aborigines themselves,
and to have asked for the setting up of
a special House Sub-Committee, com-
plete with interpreters, to examine the
desecration of sacred tribal grounds by
the mining company seeking bauxite.
Of course no aboriginal tribe has a
written language and bark paintings
never include the written word of any
kind. That is, of course, when they are
executed by aborigines. Darwin people
blame some of the over-keen do-gooders
from southern organisations for the
bark painting.
Tropical Flop
Airlines’ hopes of
-*■ having an amphibian aircraft flopping
into picturesque bays around the Bar-
rier Reef island tourist resorts in north
Queensland have been short-lived. The
much-publicised service, designed to pick
up tourists as they stepped from their
aircraft at Mackay airport and drop them
at their tropical paradise within half an
hour, has been abandoned.
The net result is that one amphibian,
bought in America for the Coralair ser-
vice, returned to Brisbane where its
future, in the words of TAA officials]
was “under consideration.”
Top TAA technical and administrative
officers came to Mackay to watch the
aircraft in its trial flights. These were
originally intended to last a few days only
but after three weeks TAA announced
the service had been abandoned. The
company announcement said local
weather conditions which would interrupt
the service more frequently than had
been anticipated had forced the company
to abandon the project.
Tourist interests were disappointed at
the collapse of the planned service. But
did TAA have to bring an aircraft all the
way from America to find out weather
conditions were unsuitable for its safe
and continued operation in these waters?

PLAIN ENGLISH
Whitehall Warriors
JjpHE most striking aspect of the
Manila Conference and after
has been the deliberate and callous
way in which Whitehall contrived
to cut the Prime Minister of
Malaya down to size. The cam-
paign to humiliate the Tungku
already smarting from the con-
frontation with Presidents Soekarno
and Macapagal in Manila began
with a series of official Whitehall
leaks to the British Press that the
Tungku had “exceeded his author-
ity” and his “instructions” in agree-
ing in principle to a UN team visit-
ing North Borneo and Sarawak to
ascertain whether the peoples of
the Territories wished to join
Malaysia or not (in point of fact
it seems that they do). This was
followed by intensive and skilled
British diplomatic activity in the
Commonwealth, in South - east
Asia, in Washington (where it
failed) and not least in Canberra, to
prove it was dangerous for the Tung-
ku to agree, or even seem to agree,
to a possible delay in the date set for
the inauguration of Malaysia
August 31. This in turn, has now
been followed by British-inspired
protests from Lee Kuan Yew in
Singapore, from Donald Stephens
in Borneo and S. K. Ningkan in
Sarawak that they cannot “agree”
to postponing the Malaysia date.
These are cries from small-time
politicians who can have very little
effect on the outcome and who do
not have to undertake the tre-
mendous responsibility for final
decisions about the security, de-
fence and viability of Malaysia
which face the Tungku. Malaya
and Malaysia proved very small
beer in Manila when confronted by
a hostile Indonesia and the Philip-
pines which, under the protection
of the United States, is now making
some very dubious and mischievous
adventures into the diplomacy of
Asian nationalism. These were
doubtless hard and unpalatable
facts but the Tungku South-east
Asia’s soundest and most con-
structive statesman has been
obliged to take a rather longer view
of history than the departing British
to whom Malaysia, among other
things, was the most convenient
device for vacating their last South-
east Asian possessions. Malaysia is
the best available solution to the
problems of the area, despite its own
inherent problems, and it is import-
ant that it should come into being
as quickly and as painlessly as pos-
sible. But could it come into being
with any guarantee of viability
after the British depart militarily if it
was to be confronted by increasing
Indonesian hostility?
Some gestures towards meeting
those Indonesian objections which
were not unreasonable, even if un-
pleasant, and towards reassuring
irrational Indonesian apprehensions
had to be made. It now seems that
the Tungku has made them. If one
of the prices of bringing Malaysia
into being is the visit of a UN mis-
sion it is no great price. Malaysia
will be all the more solidly launched
and all the more safely guaranteed
against future Indonesian hostility
if it comes into being with United
Nations blessing.
On the question of foreign bases
and the British defence commitment
to Malaya there seems to be con-
siderable confusion. While President
Soekarno has gone through his
ritualistic and predictable song and
dance act over “foreign bases” he
has not seriously questioned the
Anglo-Malayan defence agreement
any more than he has questioned the
close defence arrangements be-
tween the Philippines and the US.
It is also relevant to remember that
the defence arrangements that have
come into being in South-east Asia
resulted from the threat from Red
China a threat which grows in
intensity and menace from month
to month and of which Indonesia
is well aware.
The Treaty in Perspective
VI/FIILE no one doubts the great
” significance of the partial nuclear
test ban treaty, there has been a
tendency in some quarters to over-
estimate its importance. In the
Forum section on pages 33-35 of
this issue three experts, who all in
different ways welcome the treaty,
try to put it into perspective.
Professor E. W. Titterton, of the
Australian National University,
points out what the test ban does
not do: it does not prevent the
manufacture and stockpiling of
nuclear weapons, and it does not
prevent the development of new
ones. Dr George Modelski, also
of the ANU, points out that
non-members of the nuclear club
are outside the treaty but in a
comparatively short time almost all
independent States in the world will
be able to build nuclear weapons
or at least afford to buy them. There
is still a sort of inexorable process
at work: if, for example, India
(which is well advanced in atomic
techniques) or Red China (which,
though behind India, is also not
wasting time) develops a bomb, the
demands within Australia or Japan
also to develop them will inevitably
grow. In any case, within 20 years,
at current rates, the nuclear satura-
tion point would be reached.
Finally, Salvador de Madariaga
makes the necessary point which
must never be forgotten that even if
Russia signs a treaty it has not
abandoned its goal of world domina-
tion by “peaceful coexistence.” The
main condition for permanent peace
is the final liberation of the world
from Communism, and it would be
a tragedy if the price the free world
paid for agreement with the Com-
munists was an acceptance of the
permanent enslavement of East
Europe and Red China. Now, in-
deed, is the time to raise, not
cheapen the price of freedom in
dealing with the Communists.
All this, however, still does not
detract from the real, if limited,
value of the treaty. It is a major first
step forward, though we still have
a long way to go before we have a
full treaty, including all nuclear
powers.


THIS AUSTRALIA
LAW
The Mutilator Case
A "strange and complex ” defendant?
FROM RICHARD HALL IN SYDNEY
DT. SGT. DOUGLASS
18 pages
Tf Colin (“The Outsider”) Wilson broods
over recent criticisms of his liter-
ary works he might find some consola-
tion in the fact that he has at least one
devotee in Australia. In Sydney Central
Court No. 3, scene of many of Sydney’s
big cases and inquests over the last few
years (Yeates, Bradley, Bogle-Chandler),
two of Colin Wilson’s later works (“En-
cyclopaedia of Murder” and the Jack the
Ripper novel “Ritual in the Dark”) were
tendered as evidence in what has become
known as the Mutilation Murders case.
Between June, 1961, and November
last year four men, all belonging to the
semi-vagrant fringe of Sydney life had
been stabbed to death and mutilated
after death. Before the court for a de-
cision was William Macdonald, charged
with the murder of all four men.
What emerged from the first few days
of the hearing was the outline and noth-
ing more of the character of the 39-year-
old Liverpudlian William Macdonald
who stood, or mostly sat, in the box.
Macdonald, who has admitted to
using a string of aliases almost impos-
sible to keep count of, came from Eng-
land in 1954 or 1955 (he wasn’t sure).
A few weeks after he moved into a
delicatessen shop in the middle-class
suburb of Burwood last year a body was
found under the flooring in a badly de-
composed state. Medical evidence was
unable to establish the cause of death
and an inquest found that the body was
that of Macdonald (or rather Brennan,
the alias he had used at the PMG and
in buying the shop).
There the matter rested but for the
curiosity of one John McCarthy, a for-
mer workmate, who saw Brennan-Mac-
donald in the city last April. Having
contributed to a wreath he was rather
surprised and went to the police.
The file of the Concord death was re-
opened and fresh evidence identified the
body as Patrick Joseph Hackett. After
Australia-wide publicity Macdonald was
located working with the railways in
Melbourne.
He sat impassively in court last week,
showing an occasional nervous tic as
Detective - Sergeant Douglass of the
Sydney CIB, wearing the old boys’
badge from Newington GPS, read an
18-page statement allegedly made by
Macdonald in Melbourne in which he
confessed in detail to the murder of
Hackett because he felt “a compulsion to
kill” people of “the laboring type” who
reminded him of the corporal who had
indecently assaulted him in the army
when he was 16.
In addition to the question and answer
statement, police tendered a hand-written
account of the death of Hackett, gained
during a ten-hour interview at Russell
Street headquarters.
Police told the court that Macdonald
had said he read books like the Colin
Wilson titles and others about murder
because that was the only kind of read-
ing he got pleasure from (although one
of the books tendered was a prostitute’s
autobiography, (“To Beg I am
Ashamed”).
Against the weight of the police evi-
dence Mr R. J. (Jack) Birney, who is
appearing for Macdonald, made his line
of attack clear after only a few ques-
tions. He was urging Douglass that his
client was a “strange and complex
person.”
Mr Birney, a dogged barrister, spec-
ialising in police courts, who a year ago
was an active vice-president of the
short-lived anti-Indonesian pro-Dutch
United Australia Movement he went
to Port Moresby to attack Indonesian
imperialism is freely believed to be
appearing for Macdonald gratis.
The point of his “strange-and-com-
plex” questioning became clear when he
suggested that Macdonald had made a
false confession to another murder, that
of a cafe owner near Sydney’s Central
Station in 1957. Douglass agreed that
this was the case, but reaffirmed his
faith in the accuracy of the Melbourne
confession.
On his first court appearance in May,
Macdonald was a skinny, drawn,
stooped figure. In two months in Long
Bay gaol he has put on a stone in weight
and filled out around the face. An ugly
man, he smiled only when, gesticulating,
he made a point to his instructing soli-
citor. Despite Sydney’s cold snap, or
perhaps because of poverty, he was
wearing a summer-weight suit, but he
compromised enough with this hardy
spirit by wearing two pairs of socks.
But for all the weight of evidence a
committal hearing is only the curtain
raiser to the drama of a full-scale mur-
der trial and this is yet to come.
STATE AID
The Facts About Catholic Schools
Less emotion , more investigation
FROM DAVID ROBERTSON IN CANBERRA
T ast Wednesday, at a Newman Associa-
tion meeting of about 20 people
at the Australian National University a
senior public servant, Mr J. McCusker,
Assistant Secretary in the Education, Arts
and Sciences section of the Prime Min-
ister’s Department, spoke on “Some As-
pects of State Aid.”
As a Catholic, Mr McCusker’s pro-
posal was that Catholics should explore
the setting up of a small research group
a national secretariat on Catholic
education to collect from each
Catholic parish in Australia the facts
and figures on teachers, pupils, school
buildings, their equipment and needs in
the future, analyse them professionally
and publish the results. This type of
information, he claimed, was contained
in the annual reports of the State depart-
ments of education, but it did not exist
in the Roman Catholic Church’s “Year
Book,” and the form of what informa-
tion was available differed from parish
to parish.
A part-time professional researcher
could produce this material in a year,
given the co-operation of the parishes,


he estimated. Its value would be to
demonstrate publicly the size and task
of the Roman Catholic education system
and so win the community’s support.
Armed with cold, hard facts and a de-
fined goal of what “State aid” they
sought, Catholics might hope to achieve
results where in past campaigning, based
on emotionalism and appeals for “jus-
tice,” they had got nowhere.
Mr McCusker, a former school-
teacher in Western Australia, warned
Catholics that in voicing one of their
pet arguments, “Catholics pay twice for
the education of their children,” they
delude themselves. Parents throughout
Australia receive tax money back from
the Commonwealth in the form of in-
come tax deduction, sales tax conces-
sions, free radio licences for schools,
free milk and even road safety manuals;
and, from the NSW Government, for
example, in the form of transport allow-
ances and concessions, in-service train-
ing courses for teachers, career guidance,
and the ability to buy school equipment
through Government stores.
If Mr McCusker intended his cold,
factual approach to be a sobering in-
fluence, he did not altogether succeed.
The first speaker in the discussion
argued that Catholics must stick to the
plea for “justice” because they had no
choice between State and Catholic edu-
cation. Catholics had to send their child-
ren to Catholic schools if they were to
avoid church sanctions.
Explaining the Church policy, Father
Sharass, the chaplain to the Newman
movement, said the Roman Catholic
Church throughout the world advised
parents that Catholic schools were a
good thing and parents could send their
children to Catholic or non-Catholic
schools according to their conscience.
But if Catholic schools were available
and accessible in a parish, the parish
could refuse to grant absolution to par-
ents at confession or refuse communion
if they disregarded the Church’s advice.
A parent who lost these rites might be
doing the right thing according to his
conscience, but he implied that if so his
conscience was at fault.
Another speaker thought that the
Catholic hierarchy would not allow any
outside or inside inquiry because the
evidence brought to light would include
things they all knew about, such as one
nun teaching 100 children in a class in a
Sydney suburb. “We have been trying
to hide these things for years,” she said.
The last speaker said positively that
some priests did not want State aid
anyway, because it might bring State
control. - Even Mr McCusker agreed
that some of the hierarchy were un-
enthusiastic about State aid.
BUSINESS
The Japanese
Trade Treaty
A balance sheet of gains and risks
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
While a senior shipping executive
” from Melbourne, Walter P. Heine,
was on his way to Japan to explore the
pickings from the new Australian-
Japanese trade treaty signed in Tokyo
last week, Australian manufacturers
were finding it hard to disguise their
disgust at their let-down by the Country
Party-headed Department of Trade’s
failure to write into the treaty a more
definite safeguard against a flood of im-
ports from Japan. They are saying it has
become more important than ever now
to set up a Department of Secondary In-
dustry to protect their interests.
Japan has been put on all fours with
Britain, Canada and New Zealand so
far as future special measures to restrict
imports are concerned, and is even in
a superior position to other countries
which, unlike that select four, are not
entitled to get warning when emergency
tariff changes affecting their trade are
being contemplated.
It was not, however, total victory for
Mr McEwen’s primary exporters, be-
J. McEWEN
Not a total victory
cause the Japanese succeeded in leaving
the door ajar for imposing a duty on
wool for which they are far and away
our best customer, and they also spurned
a proposition put up to them early in the
negotiations to take 20,000 tons a year
of Australian beef. It seems to be a toss-
up whether the three-year (extended to
five) undertaking in the 1957 treaty not
to impose a duty on wool is worth more
or less than the one in the new treaty
not to discriminate between cotton and
wool in determining tariffs. (Japan
would not be likely to put a duty on
cotton except in the direst emergency,
so that would perhaps also make the
imposition of a tariff on wool only a
very remote possibility.)
While no written guarantees are given
in the treaty on the future level of our
other exports (primary or manufactured),
Japan has assured us of favorable atten-
tion within the compass of its rising
import requirements which, though the
availability of overseas funds will natur-
ally come into it, are expected to double
overall by 1970. Even so, one would not
THE AUSTRALIAN REPUBLIC
80 Years Ago: August 18, 1883
Tt cannot be too clearly understood
that, whatever benefit we derive
from our political dependence on
the United Kingdom, it derives none
at all from us. Her army? We do
not supply a soldier. Her navy? We
do not send a sailor. Her exchequer?
We do not add a shilling. Her trade?
Well, yes. We trade with her because
we can buy goods cheaper there than
in any other place. Let the merchants
of N.S.Wales be able to land French,
German or American goods at Circu-
lar Quay one per cent, cheaper than
similar goods can be landed from
England, and no patriotic considera-
tion would keep them from buying in
Paris, Berlin or New York. Why,
then, is any surprise expressed when
English statesmen show by word and
act that constitutionally governed
colonies are sources of weakness
rather than strength, and wish to be
rid of them? The newspaper which
tries to inculcate the belief that we
are never to go alone, but must always
hang on to the coat-tails of a respect-
able old body in the Northern Hemi-
sphere, is no true friend of Australia.
What our young people should be
taught, and what far-seeing English
statesmen appear to be anxious that
they should be taught, is that Aus-
tralia possesses in itself all the
materials for a great Republic; and
that eventual separation is as certain
as a future war between France and
Germany.

expect a very rapid development of our
agricultural exports to Japan as a result
of the treaty, except perhaps in the case
of sugar, in which the Japanese showed
considerable interest during the negotia-
tions.
Apart from wool and sugar, our best
immediate bets for developing exports
under the new arrangements look to be
bauxite, iron ore, coal and barley, with
prospects opening up for other rural pro-
ducts as Japan’s standard of living con-
tinues its rise and population grows
nearer the 120 million it is expected to
stabilise at in 20 years time.
On Japan’s side, without causing any
startling change in the level of imports
from Japan, the new treaty should cer-
tainly clear the path for further expan-
sion. So despite all the assurances of
restraint lest Australian manufacturers
suffer, the trend will have to be watched
closely. Imports from Japan were in the
ratio of about 1 to 2.7 exports in the
eleven months to May, 1963, a position
which represents a progressive improve-
ment in Japan’s favor in recent years,
but which even in a multilateral trading
world is still very lopsided and untenable
in the long run.
From all accounts the Japanese will
continue to act as gentlemanly as they
did under the old treaty, and do not
intend to swamp us with consumer goods,
as they were wont to do before the war
when costs in their then cheap labor
economy were only a fraction of today’s
modernised and sophisticated one.
Rather they are looking more for out-
lets for machinery, equipment and other
capital goods and also more investment
opportunities. Last week the PMG gave
them some useful orders for equipment
to make the ball roll a little faster.
The new treaty will be helpful to the
Japanese in all these directions, but more
because it gives Japan greater security
in its trade for instance, through its
right to get notice of proposed emergency
tariffs rather than because of any
new specific advantage such as it might
have secured by the scaling down of
British preferences had Britain joined
the Common Market.
In fact, when the negotiations started
last November it looked very much on
the cards that Britain would join, but
when she did not the climate of the
negotiations changed dramatically and,
it seems, to Japan’s disadvantage. For
one thing it failed to get Australia to
agree to special tariff bindings on her
exports to this country. This was one of
her main objects. If Australia had been
in the position of urgently looking for
substitute markets for its exports to Bri-
tain, Japan would probably have been
able to push the Australian negotiations
very much harder.


EDUCATION
The Future of Victorian
Universities
The Ramsay Report
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
SIR GEORGE PATON
Persuaded
HThe manoeuvres of the ambitious
Principal of the Secondary Teachers’
College, Mr D. M. McDonell, to have
certain of the College courses recognised
for degree purposes by Melbourne
University have suffered a set-back. For
a time, Mr McDonell was doing very
well in his campaign. The Vice-Chan-
cellor of Melbourne University, Sir
George Paton, was persuaded to set up
a committee to clarify the University’s
attitude towards the STC courses. Later
two study groups were formed by the
committee.
The first was given the task of investi-
gating whether the College’s courses in
Arts, Commerce and Science should be
recognised by the University. The other
group set out to investigate the worth of
the College’s courses in education. At
the STC, courses in education subjects
are combined with Arts, Science and
Commerce subjects as teacher training
in lieu of the traditional Bachelor’s
degree and Diploma of Education. It is
a system of teacher training which has
been under continuous criticism by the
Secondary Teachers’ Association, the
Victorian Teachers’ Union and many
educational authorities.
Mr McDonell himself has no doubts
at all on the matters under inquiry. He
has proclaimed that “courses now being
taught are of university-degree scope
and standard.” Objections by the Vic-
torian Secondary Teachers’ Association
and the Victorian Teachers’ Union that
the College is merely a stratagem of the
Education Department to compensate
for its failure to recruit and hold
university graduates have been blandly
ignored by Mr McDonell as he builds
and publicises his empire. He is most
silent of all on the question of how the
traditional autonomy of a university
can be reconciled with control by the
Education Department.
One humorous aspect of these
inquiries is the fact that the study groups
are expected to investigate and evaluate
certain fourth-year STC courses which
at the moment do not exist. The inquiry
is also expected to cover certain third-
year Science subjects which the STC has
not yet started to teach.
Recently the long-awaited findings of
the Ramsay Committee of Inquiry into
Victoria’s tertiary education needs were
made available in summary form. These
included unanimous recommendations
for the expansion of Monash University
and for the establishment of a new third
university in the Melbourne area, as
well as the formation of a university
college in Ballarat no later than 1966.
Dependent on the success of the Ballarat
University College, the report proposed
other country university colleges at
Geelong, in the Latrobe Valley and
Bendigo. The report contained a wide
range of other proposals for the ex-
pansion of university facilities in the
next decade.
Where Mr McDonell received a
douche of cold water was in two brief
recommendations: “Degrees should not
be awarded except by a university” and
“Existing non - degree - granting tertiary
institutions should not be converted into
universities.”
For good measure the Ramsay Report
went on to say that “teachers’ colleges
should not be used for students wishing
to do university courses. Their facilities
should be used to accommodate and
teach the normal increase in student
numbers. They, too, should concentrate
upon their particular function. They
should not add general courses to their
studies with the object of aspiring to
degree-granting status.”
The one concession to Mr McDonell’s
ambitions was a proposal that par-
ticular courses, taught by accredited'
teachers in the teachers’ colleges, be
accredited by a university. This pre-
sumably would involve some university
supervision and even selection of the
STC lecturers who conduct such courses.
In practice, it would mean that only
those STC courses conducted by uni-
versity lecturers, as distinct from Educa-
tion Department instructors, would be
eligible for recognition.
The Ramsay Report has also done
something, however temporarily, to quell
the clamor from the Royal Melbourne
Institute of Technology to have itself
elevated to a degree-conferring institu-
tion. The Tech, has gone a long way
since it was founded last century as the
Working Men’s College. Several pen-
strokes have inflated its present high-
sounding title, the latest addition being
the inclusion of the word “Royal.” What
the RMIT would like now is another
penstroke which would turn certain of
its diplomas into degrees. Some novel
arguments are being advanced in support
of its campaign. RMIT premises are
being used to give lectures in legal
subjects for students taking the course
arranged by the Victorian Law In-
stitute. This fact is cited in support of
the RMIT campaign for university
status.
Again, a few Melbourne University
Engineering students make use of its
laboratory facilities for a limited part of
their courses. This fact is also high-
lighted with glee by the RMIT cam-
paigners as proof of “university status.”
The Ramsay Report, however, made it
clear that it frowned upon technical
college facilities being used by uni-
versities. The techs., it said, should
concentrate on their own field of studies.
Their facilities should be reserved for
tech, students alone.
If only the University’s problems
could be solved by name-changing, there
would obviously be no problems at all
in Victoria.
THE ORR CASE
Declaring Tasmania Black
Or a final compromise?
FROM A HOBART CORRESPONDENT
rpHE University of Tasmania has made
its first move in seven years to
achieve a satisfactory compromise on
the Orr case. The acting Vice-Chancel-
lor, Professor A. M. Clark, has had
private discussions in Sydney with Pro-
fessor A. K. Stout, chairman of the
Australasian Philosophers’ Association,
one of the most adamant of the Uni-
versity’s opponents.
The association has had a ban on the
Tasmanian Chair of Philosophy since
1958. Last year it insisted that the ban
would be lifted only if the University

would use its “best endeavours” to
secure a suitable academic position for
Orr, carry out the instructions of the
Visitor, Lord Rowallan, on the formu-
lating of standard procedures for in-
vestigating serious complaints against
academic staff, pay Mrs Orr “generous”
compensation, and guarantee that no
further legal action would be taken
against Orr.
It is reported that the Vice-Chancellor,
Professor K. S. Isles, has found some-
one overseas who would take the Chair
of Philosophy if the ban were lifted.
This has been one of his most urgent
tasks while abroad, for the only
philosophy lecturer, Dr K. Milanov, goes
on study leave next year.
While Professor Clark was negotiating
in Sydney, the Tasmanian University
Staff Association was debating the possi-
bility of the ban becoming even more
oppressive. They had notice that the
Melbourne University Staff Association,
headed by former Tasmanian and im-
placable fighter for Orr, Professor R. D.
Wright, would demand a complete ban
on the Tasmanian University. If their
motion was carried at this month’s
meeting of the Federal Council of Uni-
versity Staff Associations, Tasmania
would be “black.”
Last week the Tasmanian Staff Associa-
tion decided to oppose any such exten-
sion of the ban. Members believe that
in the absence overseas of Professor Isles
and the Chancellor (Sir Henry Baker)
some compromise may be reached. The
acting Vice-Chancellor is not deeply
committed.
But there is strong belief that Tas-
mania’s delegates will have a battle to
hold the Federal Council hounds this
time.
ALP
Why Santamaria Survives
It's up to the Labor Party
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
B. A. SANTAMARIA
“Bogey man?"
Oooner or later, for its own good,
the ALP will have to stop seeing
Mr B. A. Santamaria as a “bogey man”
and start coldly assessing him and the
influence he exerts upon the Australian
electorate through his National Civic
Council.
_. . ~ ,
This bogey man approach was pres-
ent at the recent Perth Federal Confer-
_ . , . ....
ence. Santamaria s plump, smallboned
„ , K ,
figure was absent from the conference
proceedings but his ghost walked un-
ceasmgly through the modern,she build-
mg in which the conference met. He got
much more attention than the Common-
tst Party and probably headed Prime
Minister Sir Robert Menz.es and his
Liberals in the number of mentions and
hate sessions he received.
The ‘"bogey man” approach seriously
weakens the ALP’s capacity to think out
their ideological and electoral problems
coldly and thoroughly. They blame San-
tamaria for everything. They blame him
for the fact that Labor governments fell
in Victoria and Western Australia (he
sometimes also gets blamed for the fall
of the Gair Labor Government in
Queensland) and for the fact that the
vote of the Democratic Labor Party,
which has Santamaria’s and the NCC’s
backing, has kept Labor out of govern-
ment federally since the split of 1955.
On the surface they are right. He
certainly had a hand in the fall of the
Cain Labor Government in Victoria and
the Hawke Labor Government in West-
ern Australia. His backing also un-
doubtedly was the major factor in pre-
servj , he federa| s(re h of the DLp

in Victoria, where Labor hopes for cap-

bourne Roman Catholic parish priests
support him, and their influence with
their parishioners provides him with a
ready-made following and access to new
recruits to his anti-Communist crusade,
These are easy answers which, in reality,
provide no answer at all. There are
sections of the Roman Catholic hier-
archy who do not agree with Archbishop
Mannix’s support for Santamaria, there
are Roman Catholic priests who oppose
him steadfastly, and there are thousands
of Roman Catholics who are staunchly
pro-ALP despite his influence.
It is not so much Santamaria’s in-
fluence and organising ability as the
weapons which Labor has placed in
his hands that has helped to bring down
State Labor governments and to keep
Labor out of federal office. It has been
Labor’s ambiguous approach to Com-
munism that has made a success of his
anti-Communist drive; the ALP-Com-
munist party link-up in the trade union
movement through unity tickets in trade
union elections that has allowed him
to preserve a residue of strength in the
industrial field; and the tolerance, in
fact at times the support, for what seems
suspiciously like Communist-aligned and
anti-American policies in foreign affairs
that has kept the DLP alive federally.
It has been Labor’s weaknesses, even
more than Roman Catholic backing,
which has provided Santamaria’s
strength. The almost dedicated hatred
that so many ALP men feel for Santa-
maria has to a considerable degree
blinded them to the difference between
his power now and his power in 1954,
when the forces he controlled within
the ALP came within an ace of taking
it over. Mr Santamaria undoubtedly
could have been a major factor in de-

Qantas helps Australian manufacturer set
bullish trends on world’s ‘bear’ markets
This story of the three bears (and many thousands more) is a top export success story year after year.
H. Morelia Pty. Ltd., of Sydney, manufacturers of furry marsupial toys, is being deluged with demands
for its cuddly koalas from souvenir shops the world over. In Hawaii, on the U.S. mainland ... in
England, Italy, Spain, Japan, tourists quickly exhaust existing stocks. Rush consignments of 1,000
are therefore common to Morelia. And they all go via Qantas Air Cargo as did a recent consignment of
I, to London alone. Morelia openly admit that they just wouldn’t be able to keep up with these
ever-increasing demands, without Qantas. And as they export more than 45% of their products, that’s
a lot of bears going by air! At low, special-commodity rates. With deliveries made within 48 hours.
This pleases shop owners everywhere, who can thus maintain low stock levels and get new consignments
in on short notice. One London curio shop owner has gone so far as to say: “We’d be up a gum tree
without Qantas Air Cargo.”

ciding the future Australian way of life
while he had a chance of taking over,
holus bolus, one of the most important
Australian political parties as he had
until 1954. But when his activities were
attacked by the then Federal Labor
leader, Dr H. V. Evatt, in 1954 and
1955, he ceased to be a dominant power
and became merely one of several
forces operating in and on the fringe
of the ALP. He became the leader not
of Roman Catholics, but of a Roman
Catholic faction, and as such a force,
but only a minor, comparatively ineffec-
tive force, in a predominantly Protestant
country.
To put Santamaria and his NCC in
the same class as Mr Khrushchev or Mao-
Tse-tung and the Australian Communist
Party (which is the local representa-
tive of a great world force) is to allow
hate to warp judgment to a ludicrous
extent. It is doubtful, whatever backing
Santamaria has either politically or in-
dustrially, that he will be able to match
in the future the resources that the
Australian Communist Party (which sup-
ports Khrushchev and the Moscow line)
or Mr Ted Hill, leader of the Commun-
ist Party breakaway (which supports the
“hard” Chinese line that Marxist coun-
tries should export revolution by force
of arms) will command.
Despite its minute size, the Australian
Communist Party has a key place in
the world power struggle. The party,
having secured control of the Austra-
lian maritime unions, built a Pacific-
wide Communist control of Pacific ports
a control that enabled the Australian
Seamen’s Union federal secretary, E. V.
Elliott, to boast to an East Berlin Com-
munist gathering that no arms supplies
or equipment for Australian troops
fighting in Korea had gone by sea and
that the Commonwealth Government
had been forced to lift everything by air.
Mr Hill has been to Peking for orders
since the split, and his opposite numbers
on the pro-Moscow side have been to
Moscow. The Australian apparatus, as
the control point in the Communist
industrial complex in the Pacific, is of
such importance that from here on the
sky will be the limit of resources as
Moscow and Peking dispute for the
allegiance of the Australian party.
Against this background Santamaria,
as the leader of a minority Roman
Catholic faction, is very small “beer”
indeed.
The ALP could destroy his industrial
power tomorrow by taking over the
fight against Communism in the trade
unions, just as they could destroy the
Communist Party's power though
this would probably take the ALP
longer; the Communists are more firmly
entrenched.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT
The End of
the CCC
Back to 1945
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
P. HILLS
Experts
VTot a sound of protest was heard nor
were there any funeral drums beat-
ing in Sydney last week for the dying
Cumberland County Council.
Since early 1946 an indirectly elected
body of ten aldermen representing coun-
cils scattered through the County of
Cumberland (i.e., Sydney and some
adjacent areas) have governed the town
planning of the area.
But a decision last week by the State
Parliamentary Labor Party means the
establishment of a State Planning Author-
ity to take over the functions of the
Cumberland County Council and the
similar body in the Newcastle area—the
Northumberland County Council.
The Planning Authority will be under
the direction and control of the Minister
for Local Government, Mr Hills. The
authority will draw on a formidable
array of talent, but it will be a virtual
department within a department—Local
Government. This raises the question of
principle, very familiar to modern life,
of how far the professional experts
should be preferred to the elected
administrators.
The reasons why the Council, or the
CCC as it is known, is passing without
outcry are not hard to understand. After
the release of The Plan in 1948 there
were years of wrangles over compensa-
tion, squabbles over the Green Belt, and
common Ministerial intervention. In its
life the CCC has had both non-Party
(i.e., semi-Liberai) and Labor chairmen.
When the CCC rejected its chief plan-
ners’ advice, as it did not infrequently,
there were accusations, both implicit and
explicit, that they should never go against
their experts.
Another crippling burden for the CCC
was the fact that it had so much petty
development approval work to do.
There is irony in the fact that the
new Authority with its regional advisory
committees is a return to the original
State Government plans in 1945. The
indirectly elected County Council had
been included in the legislation only after
protests at the future of town planning
being given entirely over to the experts.

NEW STATES
The March on Sydney
The ghost of John Dunmore Lang
From PATRICK HENRY
J. D. LANG
The Leader
HHhe New England New State Move-
A ment is planning a “Sydney Expedi-
tion” which will probably swoop on the
sleeping metropolis on August 28 with a
smaller force directed against the Can-
berra citadel.
An enlistment drive is now in pro-
gress to obtain undertakings from at
least 200 car drivers willing to bring
loads of New State supporters from all
parts of the area which extends from
Newcastle to the Queensland border.
Lt-Col J. M. L. Macdonald of
Wallabadah has been appointed Ex-
pedition Marshal and Deputy-Marshal
is A. D. Cameron who runs a
firm of veterinary supplies in In-
verell. Though it is said that the Expedi-
tion w'ill be organised with “military pre-
cision" the only weapons to be carried
will be placards, banners and their words
of w'isdom. With military discipline the
exact details of the march are being kept
secret.
The purpose of the Expedition is to
corner the Macquarie Street lion which is
as elusive as the New State's most famous
quadruped, the Emmaville panther.
Without debate the NSW Parliament has
shelved a petition signed by 32,000 per-
sons. The Premier has declined to meet a
New' State deputation on many occasions
and the Minister for Decentralisation,
Mr J. B. Renshaw, has rejected a deputa-
tion to discuss “the means of decentralisa-
tion.’’ A motion for a referendum on
self-government, placed on the notice
paper by the Leader of the Opposition
last year, has been expunged despite an
undertaking by the Premier that he
would place no obstacle in the way of
its discussion.
New-Staters have the Commonwealth
Government in the gun also because it
has taken no action on the unanimous re-
port of the all-party committee on con-
stitutional review, which proposed an
amendment of the New State provisions
of the Constitution in 1958. Since then
a motion has been moved by the Leader
of the Opposition seeking action on the
report, two New State deputations have
met the Prime Minister, the subject has
been debated on a special motion in the
house, a petition has been presented to
the House of Representatives and another
sent to London for transmission to the
Queen.
Frustration has caused New State sup-
porters to abandon the system of genu-
flection before the mighty and commence
a campaign of positive action by the
rank and file. Hence the demonstrations
which greeted and dogged 50 members
of the State Parliament who visited Nar-
rabri earlier this year and Cabinet
Ministers who assembled at Lismore for
an historic tw'o-hours Cabinet meeting.
(They were told to “Go Back to NSW”.)
The ghost of John Dunmore Lang is
expected to lead the New England legions
on their Sydney Expedition to remind
posterity that almost single-handed he
formed the New' State of Queensland,
modelled the New State of Victoria and
laid the foundations of the New England
agitation, the longest-lived and most per-
sistent of its kind in Australian history.
QUEENSLAND
Liberals’ War with Country Party
Blowing up the Coalition
FROM A BRISBANE CORRESPONDENT
T ast month, after 15 minutes’ dis-
cussion, the Queensland Country
Party's annual State conference rejected
the Liberal Party's sixth bid for a com-
plete union of the Liberal and Country
Parties.
Since then things have gone from bad
to worse. Commenting on the Country
Party’s rejection of the Liberal Party’s
offer, the State Country Party president
(Mr A. G. E. Lawrie) said his party was
not uniting with anyone, it was expand-
ing independently on an Australia-wide
basis. A very strong organisation had
been started in Tasmania, and plans
were under way for its establishment in
South Australia.
Soon afterwards came the announce-
ment that the Liberal Party had estab-
lished branches in the Country Party seat
of South Coast, at Southport and Surfers’
Paradise, and in Lockyer, a south-east
Queensland rural seat held by a Liberal,
who has the backing of the Country
Party, Transport Minister Mr G. Chalk.
Meanwhile, Mr Gordon Chalk is re-
ported to be facing expulsion from the
Liberal Party for refusing to assist in
the formation of Liberal branches in the
Lockyer electorate. There have been
widespread rumors that Mr Chalk will
join the Country Party.
The Country and Liberal Parties
should remember the Labor split that
opened the way for them to power in
1957.


Managing the Managers
“A time-study man can't waste time"
By PATRICIA ROLFE
Acceptance is the number one prob-
lem of the management consultant.
It is one of the new professions
which in the postwar years have begun
the struggle onwards and upwards. The
consultant wants to be considered essen-
tial, central, and to acquire the prestige
that the barrister puts on with his wig
or the surgeon with his rubber gloves;
or, at the least, he wants to be considered
as more than a parasitic growth on the
body of business.
In Australia acceptance is still fairly
spotty. On the one hand, Mr Walter
Scott, CMG, head of the oldest Austra-
lian firm of management consultants,
sits as chairman of the Decimal Currency
Board, which will advise the Federal
Treasury on how the change to decimal
coinage can most smoothly and efficient-
ly be accomplished. This is acceptance
of a high order; and what is good for
Mr Scott is good for management con-
sulting. (Acceptance generally comes
with time and Mr Scott’s firm is 25
years old this year.)
By contrast, a young management
consultant, recently in Cessnock on the
northern coalfields of NSW, was carried
in effigy through the main streets of the
town. He was there to advise on what
industries could be established in the
town to provide work for miners thrown
out of jobs by mine-closures, and his firm
had had nothing to do with recommend-
ing that any mines be closed. Other
consultants have had flour-bombs and
other tokens of lack of esteem thrown
at them on the factory floor.
It is obviously worthwhile for Mr
Scott to give up a great deal of time
over several years to chair, in an honor-
ary capacity, the Decimal Currency
Committee, which made the original
recommendation to the Treasury, and
now to spend another couple of years
on the Board which will see through
the Committee’s recommendation. Mr
Scott is a public-spirited man with a
record of work for Legacy and Rotary.
Nonetheless he is a member of a pro-
fession which needs publicity, continu-
ing publicity and publicity of the right
sort. His role as “Mr Decimal” in the
popular mind gets it home to businessmen
that when the Treasury plans a major
change it calls for help from a manage-
ment consultant. It also gets it home in
some degree to everyone who will even-
tually handle royals instead of pounds.
This is important because, apart from the
strength which the unions in Australia
can summon against the management
consultant and his recommendations, it
is basic that the consultant should be on
side with the man on the assembly line
as much as the man in the executive
chair.
Whatever the strength of arguments
for or against the management consul-
tant, he goes into the business battle
with pretty thin armor. He is called in
only for a specific job. Before under-
taking it, he does a preliminary survey,
setting out the type of job to be done,
the length of time it will take, the cost
and the results which can be expected.
Even when the job is begun, there is no
contract or long-term arrangement. If
the management of the client firm
decides that it does not want the work
completed, it has only to say so and the
consultant comes off the job. There
seems to be nothing, except the con-
sultant’s astuteness, to stop unscrupulous
management picking the brains of the
consultant and then cutting the job short.
The management consultant cannot
look forward to the establishment of a
permanent practice with as much assur-
ance as, say, solicitors or auditors. Most
firms carry on with the same solicitors
from year to year, and auditors have
only to go through the procedure of
being moved and seconded at the share-
holders’ meeting, generally a formality.
The management consultant is paid a
daily fee. This varies. Sometimes the
larger firms may charge more because of
higher overheads, which, in turn, may
mean greater facilities to the client. But
this does not always follow. Consultants
charge what they think they can. Top
fee in Australia is 225 guineas a week
and the minimum something like 100
guineas. A management consultant will
not bargain for, say, a percentage of
increased turnover which may come as
a result of his recommendations.
Consultants put stress on the amount
of repeat work they get from clients, as
evidence of satisfaction. This repeat
work may snowball to a point where a
firm will be doing consulting work for
a client almost throughout the year, but
it is still on a daily basis and not a re-
tainer. Scott’s put their repeat figure
at 75 per cent.
Management consultants do not
advertise nor do they discuss their clients.
A Sydney businessman gave as the
simple truth that in recent years a firm
of management consultants saved a local
company £250,000. However, the
management consultants cannot boast of
this achievement, and, human nature

being what it is, It is unlikely that the
client firm will be over-generous in giving
the consultant credit.
However, there seem to be few
sections of industry in which manage-
ment consultants have not got at least
one foot through the door. Apart from
Mr Scott’s honorary work for the
Treasury, both State and Federal
Government Departments and local
government authorities have made quite
extensive, and what seems to be growing,
use of consultants. At least one trade
union has taken a problem to them. The
consultant would not say which union,
but said that “it would surprise you”.
It is perhaps the pattern for large
firms, rather than small, to go to con-
sultants first. The problems of a large
firm are more complex and the manage-
ment less personal. But, of course, the
firm with real problems is the growing
one. In Britain at present the manage-
ment consultants are making a concerted
attack on smaller businesses the limit
set Is a staff of less than 100 and
consultants here are anxious to go as
far down the scale as they can.
One consultant mentioned shipping as
one industry in which his firm had done
no work, and one in which he felt little
had been done. It is not a notably
efficient one, and he felt that between
the owner, the Seamen’s Union and the
Waterside Workers’ Federation it was
one he could bear to keep out of.
Although a figure of £250,000 a year
saved can be tossed about, there are no
reliable or comprehensive figures of the
penetration of Australian business by
consultants, nor of those elusive results
which can be credited to them. However,
it has been established that in Britain
91 per cent of companies, listed on the
London Stock Exchange with issued
capital of £10,000,000 or more, have
used consultants. Thirty-seven per cent
of the 100 largest American firms have
used them.
Although management consultants do
not advertise nor discuss their clients,
they do go out after business. Some
clients come to them, but if they see an
opportunity for business they “tout” for
it. A present tendency is for chartered
accountants to move into consulting,
particularly in the financial field. How-
ever, more conservative firms cannot get
away from the stiff-necked profession-
alism, which demands that they should
wait until they are asked.
When you say that management con-
sultants in Australia do or do not act
in a certain way, these rules are only
something which they impose upon them-
selves. A fairly obvious way for consul-
tants to establish and maintain standards
for their profession would be to set up
a professional body. There is none here,
nor are consultants registered or under
any supervision.
Professional Association
HHhere is a professional body in the
A United States, the Association of
Consulting Management Engineers,
founded as long ago as 1932 and dating
back to when most of the emphasis was
on engineering and production methods.
The British Management Consultants’
Association was founded in 1956. It has
four founder members and four other
members.
ACME requires that a firm wanting
to join the association should have been
in business as consultants for five years,
that it must be serving clients in at
least two recognised areas of manage-
ment and must have a permanent staff
of at least five principals. The Americans
make no stipulation about university
training; possibly this is taken for granted
there. However, the American is almost
invariably a “pure” consultant. He
merely tenders expert advice, whereas in
Australia and the United Kingdom it is
the consultant’s responsibility to see the
project through.
The British association, the Manage-
ment Consultants’ Association, of which
Personnel Administration Pty Ltd, with
branches in Australia, is a founder
member, stipulates five years as the
minimum time the firm shall have been
operating as consultants, with 10 years
as the minimum time in the profession
for the head of the firm. It also stipulates
at least five consultants on the staff and
that not less that 80 per cent of the
consulting staff shall be graduates.
British consultants are registered with
the British Institute of Management.
They are accepted by the institute on its
own standards, not on the Management
Consultants’ Association's. Any firm
wanting to use a consultant can ring the
institute and be given a list of consul-
tants considered competent to do the job.
Both the American and British associa-
tions have fairly stiff codes of ethics, and


it is these in general which Australian
consulting firms voluntarily follow. In
Australia there is no move, beyond
sporadic discussion, towards a profes-
sional association. Nor is there much
desire by either the consultants or the
Australian Institute of Management to
adopt a system of registration. “We feel
our best protection is our own reputation
and standards,” is the gist of the attitude
of consultants. And that is probably
where things .will stay for some time.
One local consultant gave his opinion
that, on the basis of British requirements,
only two local firms Walter Scott’s
and Personnel Administration would
qualify for membership of a professional
association. This may be cutting it a bit
fine, and in any case there could be per-
fectly legitimate reasons for Australian
firms following different patterns from
the British. Most local firms, above the
one-man business, work in more than
one field; time will solve the length-of-
experience problem.
That leaves the graduate percentage.
It may not be particularly sensible at this
stage to insist on university qualifications
for Australian consultants. This would
not be to give way to the still fairly
prevalent feeling that academics are not
“practical” and that experience is the
only teacher. It would rather be because
Australian universities do not yet, and
in some cases are only reluctantly coming
to believe that they should, teach
business. This is the root of the consul-
tant’s feeling that he lacks professional
standing, and is something which he
shares with the whole world of business.
Most of the universities no longer
wipe their hands of the matter, but,
characteristically, most of them are now
bidding against each other to build up
their commerce and economics faculties.
This may effectively rule out the pos-
sibility of any one school being built up
to the standard of, say, Harvard or
Stanford.
Practical Experience
A lthough Walter Scott’s employ con-
sultants with degrees through to
doctor, Mr Scott believes that in some
spheres, notably marketing, practical ex-
perience may be more valuable than
university degrees. He is inclined to
think that the newly established Chair of
Marketing at the University of NSW
should go to a practical, if academically
unqualified, man, backed up with some-
one with suitable American degrees,
rather than vice versa.
Partly, perhaps, because of the
universities’ constrained attitude towards
business, management consulting in Aus-
tralia did not begin its growth in the
most receptive soil. Although a brochure
on management consulting may pon-
derously point that “The practice of
seeking advice is older than history:
Alexander the Great consulted the
Oracle at Delphi before setting out to
conquer the ancient world . . . , even
Julius Caesar consulted the augurers
before proceeding to the steps of the
Senate . . the self-made, self-taught
businessman who expanded and develop-
ed in the early decades of this century
did not get ahead on the assumption
that he should ask advice, but rather
that he knew everything. And there are
still plenty of businessmen who wouldn’t
know what happened to Caesar on the
steps of the Senate, and, if they were
told, would say that’s what comes of
asking other people’s advice.
Chronologically, the first shoot of what
is now a heavily bushed tree of know-
ledge was time-and-motion study. This
came out of the early studies of Ameri-
cans Taylor and Gilbreth, but, like some
later ideas on management, was too
enthusiastically taken up by the wrong
people and so for a time rendered almost
useless. Forced to an illogical conclusion,
it became something that was sung about
in “The Pajama Game” “I’m a time-
study man, and a time-study man can’t
waste time” and on which Charlie
Chaplin said the last word in “Modern
Times”.
When people realised that men were
not machines, the personal factor came
to be weighed more carefully. Vocational
guidance was taken out of the questing
hands of the old-time phrenologist, who
confidently proclaimed that the lad would
make a splendid business executive,
market gardener or tight-rope walker,
perhaps on the strength of a bump on
the head acquired in a fight after school.
Industrial psychology was established and
acquired entire respectability.
In the postwar years management
consulting went into several new fields
and developed its interest in others. Even
within the past few years it has moved
into other specialised areas, such as
computers.
Today, a full range of consulting
services would, if set out in a diagram,
look rather like the old family trees of
the crowned heads of Europe. Most
branches overlap or are linked at some
point. They run through general manage-
ment, which might cover long-range
planning, new products, cost reductions
down to such marginal matters as office
layout. Other major areas are produc-
tion, finance and cost control, marketing,
staff and executive selection and training.
The large firms of management con-
sultants make a great deal of a “wide
range of services” as an indication of
their capabilities and standing. They like
to feel not only that they can handle
most management problems but that
their strength is spread fairlv evenly
through the range.
Personnel Administration cuts its
work up as:

Executive selection 5
Financial, i.e., management
accounting, standard cost-
ing, budgetary control 15
Production: work study,
methods investigation, plant

plant maintenance 20
Clerical organisation 10
Marketing: all phases, includ-
ing export 20
Computers 15
Miscellaneous: including long-
range planning, operations
research, factory and store
location 15
Industrial psychology is, perhaps, the
most suspect branch of management
consulting, and some consultants seem
wary of betraying any interest in it. Mr
Walter Scott says that his firm was
“forced” into executive selection only by
pressure from clients, who say, in effect:
You have shown us how the job can be
done, but who can do it for us? Mr Scott
said that most of his and his firm’s
vocational guidance was voluntary. “We
get friends and friends of friends sending
along their sons to find out the facts of
business life,” he said.
Disarming Answer
TTowever, some firms specialise in in-
dustrial psychology, their work
fanning out from people as others’
spreads out from machines or money.
Why a businessman should have to pay
someone to choose his staff is the
hardest of all aspects of management
consulting to explain. However, con-
sultants have a most disarming answer:
They can save the top executive’s time,
and, obviously, the top executive’s time
is more valuable than the consultant’s.
The fee for finding an executive is
generally a percentage of the first year’s
salary.
Management consultants do not choose
people for jobs. They merely sift applica-
tions and make recommendations. The
final selection is with the client. Most
consultants say that the smaller business-
man does not need help in choosing
staff. The smaller businessman who picks
someone because he likes his type will
probably get someone to fit in with his
team, just as easily as he would by more
scientific methods.
There are particular cases for which
firms may call in consultants. One might
be when a firm intends to go ahead
with a new project. Advertising for staff
would only let their rivals know in
advance what they are doing.
Another instance might be when an
overseas firm intends to open up here.

staff selection, sifted through applications

for a whole range of executives for an
overseas company. Representatives of
the overseas company spent only a few
days in Australia initially, but when they
came back a few months later they had
their staff set up for them. Otherwise, an
executive of the company would have
had to stay in Australia, advertise the
jobs and then sift through applications
which would often contain references
from companies unknown to him. He
would also not be alert to the profes-
sional job-hunter. The names and qualifi-
cations of some of these must now be
known to every management consultant
in Australia.
Choosing people for jobs overlaps
another branch of consulting, which goes
under the slightly misleading heading of
“clerical organisation”. It is merely
organising the vanishing army of clerks,
generally in banks and insurance com-
panies. Banks, which choose executives
from within their own ranks, have par-
ticular problems. How can they know
that the young man who joins them at
18 will be capable, 15 years later, of
being the smiling, sympathetic face in the
newspaper advertisement which says that
Mr So-and-so will welcome you today at
Such-and-such a branch of Such-and-
such a bank?
Moral Question
Tt is obvious that in investigations of
office staff the recommendations on
the use of computers or other mechanical
equipment will sometimes come down to
saying that people should be sacked. This
should hardly be a moral question for
management consultants, but some of
them make it so. Walter Scott’s say un-
equivocally that they will not undertake a
job if their preliminary survey tells them
they will have to recommend that staff
be sacked. In many cases the manage-
ment consultant has merely to advise
the client to stop recruiting, although in
the long run, as school-leavers are begin-
ning to learn, this amounts to the same
thing.
By and large, management consultants
do not complain of difficulties with trade
unions. It would not be tactful to com-
plain and they do make initial ap-
proaches to get the union on side. How-
ever, the trade unions are by no means
the headache they might be. One
management consultant said that at least
one union secretary was “so much in
advance of his time” in his thinking on
management that he had continually to
tone down his attitudes.
A profession which depends so much
on high-calibre, well-trained people can
obviously be only as effective as the
people who go into it. Management con-
sultants do not generally recruit straight
from university. Personnel Administra-
tion says it will not take people before
30-35 years. Then the recruit is regarded
as untrained. Walter Scott says that
sometimes a recent graduate can be the
most useful person to take on. A
mathematician just out of university
would be entirely up-to-date in his know-
ledge. Further experience, which would
probably be only teaching or lecturing,
would be no advantage. To Scott’s, that
is.
However, 30 to 35 is the age at which
the bright young executive sees vistas
opening up before him in his own firm,
or begins to receive flattering offers from
rival companies. Management consul-
tants must bid against stiff competition.
But the management consultant should
not —and cannot without risk of losing
the client—poach staff from his clients,
although there is nothing to stop the
client trying to buy a consultant if he
wishes.
Walter Scott and most people with
considerable experience in finding con-
sultants are inclined to think they are
born and that there are some people who
will stay in consulting in spite of induce-
ments to leave. None of the large firms
complain of high turnover of staff. Per-
sonnel Administration puts their turn-
over of consultants at two or three per
cent per year.
Management consulting would have a
higher standing if it did not have such a
wide fringe. There has been considerable
movement in and out of the profession
in the past decade. This is rather like the
revolving-door progress of journalists in
and out of public relations.
At present there are 100 firms listed
in the pink pages of the Sydney telephone
book under the headings of business,
industrial and/or management consul-
tants. In the Melbourne phone book,
under similar headings, there are 104
firms, but the numbers thin out to a
dozen or so in the smaller capitals.
Management consultants express
astonishment at this proliferation and
say that the established firms in Sydney
and Melbourne could be counted on the
fingers of both hands.
It is easy to break down the entries.
For instance, in Sydney there is a Con-
tinental astrologer, who, while he might
have been perfect for Alexander the
Great, cannot be counted as a manage-
ment consultant in the modern sense.
There are pastoral consultants, and
people who specialise in transport,
graphic arts and packaging, customs and
tariffs. There are one-man firms which
specialise in one type of work.
After this the fringe tends to get a bit
tatty, and management consulting dips
into the fly-by-night school of salesman-
ship, which may be just one step better
than the old-style phrenologist. Courses
in salesmanship and other branches of
business are a legitimate part of manage-
ment, but there is always the fact that
anyone can start one. The attitude of


the established consultant to these is
generally to look the other way, or to feel
that most of these enterprises do not last
long enough for anyone to worry much
about them.
—There show4hat the one-
man consultant is likely to be less
conscientious or efficient than the large
firm. In one or two cases highly qualified
people have left larger firms to set up on
their own. Temperamentally they prefer
it. Some of these one-man firms are
called in for specialised jobs by clients
who use other consultants for other work.
However, it may be possible that the
one-man consulting firm may fail a client
because he simply does not see problems
related to the one he is dealing with —•
he may do wonders with production
when the root trouble is marketing,
Consultants say it is not easy for the
one-man firm to survive the peaks and
valleys of income which are the natural
graph of consulting. Also, it is difficult
for the small man to do a job specifica-
tion for a new client while he is working
on another job.
Management consultants can line up
impressive arguments for using their
services, but the case against is pre-
sented by one incompetent job or one
disreputable consultant. The manage-
ment consultant’s awareness of the
fragility of his reputation remains the
best guarantee that he will do what he
sets out to do.
OUT AND ABOUT
A Small Australian Tragedy
“Verandahs are dodgy ”
By G. B. CUNNINGHAM
Brisbane is a marvellous place for
beautiful old pubs. They give the
city a charm all the more surprising
to the traveller from the south after he
has been promised only a “country town
atmosphere.” Their gradual disappear-
ance is part of a small Australian
tragedy.
The latest victim is the Royal George
Hotel in The Valley. A sign up says,
“Reconstruction of the Royal George for
Castlemaine Perkins Ltd,” listing the firms
involved, and the beautiful old cast-iron
verandahs are down except for a last,
lonely pink lace tier on the top balcony.
Charged with this latest act of philis-
tinism, a charming man from Castle-
maine Perkins, the brewery which owns
Royal George, said on the telephone
that the Licensing Commission had
wanted the hotel renovated. No one
would blame them, for glimpses inside
the public bars showed them as grim and
grimy as a Pickwickian workhouse. But
why the change outside? The man from
Castlemaine Perkins gave an apologetic
verbal shrug,
“Well, verandahs are dodgy,” he said,
“Hard to keep in repair and you know
how people are, leaning on the railings
and having them give way and everyone
is in trouble. Councils always like to do
away with verandah posts in the street
so everything is tidy, and once they go
the verandahs are harder to maintain.
Why, in Toowoomba all our hotels got
notice from the council to replace the
posts with cantilevers within a certain
time and that was that.”
Didn’t he think the grace and beauty
of the old hotel exteriors and the
special air they gave Brisbane was worth
preserving? “I wish you could convince
the civic fathers of that,” he said, side-
stepping neatly. He sounded too pleasant
and civilised to be taxed with the sugges-
tion that the breweries are concerned
only with a sound building that will
hold as many beer-swillers as possible
and never mind their aesthetic souls.
Still, there are points of consolation.
Everything is up-to-date inside the Carl-
ton Hotel, Queen Street, but outside
nothing has been lost. The cast-iron
balconies are still there and freshly
painted in a way that promises preserva-
tion. Painters are at work, too, on the
wedge-shaped balconies of the National
Hotel on a Queen Street corner.
Down by the Botanic Gardens is a
glorious colonial pub with its starched
lace skirts properly picked out in white,
its corrugated roofs curving down as
plumply as a ’nineties belle. Appro-
priately, it is called the Bellevue. Once
the home of the famous Marrying
Maguires, it is owned by no brewery.
English hotelier Joseph Bonenti, who
heads the company which runs the place,
waited six years to get his hands on the
Bellevue while he managed a hotel up
the road. Mr Bonenti does not find the
verandahs alarming and would sooner
die than have anyone touch one panel of
the sparkling white ironwork of the
facade.
People from overseas make a point of
coming back to stay there because of the
uniquely Australian atmosphere of the
place. John Betjeman was in raptures
about it and American comedian Victor
Borge would stay nowhere else when he
is in Brisbane. Another true colonial
beauty that is kept at her prime is the
Regatta Hotel out along Coronation
Drive, by the Brisbane River.
The strange thing is that local people
do not seem to see the pubs as anything
to shout about. The President of the
Queensland National Trust Association,
Mr W. R. Moon, sounded mildly surpris-
ed when asked if anything was being done
to stop the disappearance of these
delightful bits of domestic architecture.
“Well, no, we hadn’t thought about any-
thing like hotels,” he said. “They are
mostly the breweries’ concern. Perhaps
you could write to the council about it.”
The Association, to be elevated to a
full Trust by an Act of Parliament in
August, was started by Mr Moon in 1959
when he gave six acres of his family
property at Brookfield, near Brisbane, as
a tree reserve and bird sanctuary in
memory of his parents, Thomas and
Susan Moon, who arrived in Queens-
land from Sussex in 1863. There is no
money in hand yet to do anything more
than list buildings it wants to preserve.
Only members at £-2/2/- a head can
let the Trust function once it is on an
authoritative footing.
But there does not seem much hope
for many of the old colonial beauties
blooming about city and suburbs like
faded roses in the prosaic cabbage patch
of the 20th century. One wonders
what the council of New Orleans feels
about verandah posts.

Wines to Buy
The value of youth
By CELLARMASTER
In talking of Australian wines com-
parison with overseas wines is in-
evitable, although it’s a pity that there
are so many people who seem to taste
our wine merely to place it in some
overseas category, or to find some point
of similarity which from that moment on
is its chief virtue.
I am not of these. In fact, I am one
of the radicals who wants to see the
complete elimination of overseas re-
gional wine names applied to our table
wines, preferring the honest and forth-
right naming of region, grape type,
blend, etc. I believe that Australian
wines have distinctive regional charac-
teristics which do not coincide exactly
with those of Bordeaux, the Bour-
gogne or the Rhine Valley, and as such
should be judged and classed. Yet re-
cently I have tasted, and been fooled by,
local wine which I thought to be im-
ported.
The first was a 1954 Cabernet Shiraz
blend from the Seaview Winery in South
Australia sold by Douglas Lamb under
the St Patrice label. This was shown
at a blind tasting attended by some of
the top professional and amateur wine
men in the state. Almost unanimously
they agreed that this was a fine French
burgundy, costing anything up to 455.
a bottle, and arguments tabled were in
relation to the actual vineyard and com-
mune only. Consternation was great
when the wrapper was taken off, es-
pecially when it was pointed out that
this wine cost very few shillings a bottle.
Shortly afterwards, I was fortunate to
be a guest at a luncheon during which
some magnificent wines were served. Just
roll these names and vintages around
your tongue and pardon my excusable
fervor: Chateau Margaux 1929, Chateau
Margaux 1918, Chateau Pavie 1924,
Chateau Pavie 1908, Batard Montrachet
1937 en magnum, Grands Echezeaux
1947. Among the three Australian
wines tasted was a 1935 Lindeman’s
Dry Red Bin No 3836 made by Syd Lin-
deman. This, again, had an outstanding
French burgundy character, although
from a completely different area than
the Seaview red. The Lindeman’s wine
was judged to be a far better French
wine than the Grands Echezeaux.
Finally, within a matter of days, at
a masked tasting I have drunk two
wines that I, and others present, have
thought to be from France. They were
the famous 1958 Dalwood Chablis and
another Lindemans, a 1959 White Bur-
gundy bin 1333.
Now the point of all this is that
these wines were all available at one
time or other to the public at very
moderate prices, and, logically, could
therefore all exist in some wise buyer’s
cellar. Therefore he could drink wines
now that are every bit as good as some
of the best of France at prices five to
ten times cheaper. So once again we are
shown the value of buying young and
therefore inexpensive wine for storage.
I firmly believe that the great wines
of France, that is, the absolutely top
wines of Bordeaux and Burgundy, are
the best in the world, irrespective of
cost. They are available year after year,
although of course they vary consider-
ably from vintage to vintage. Below this
level lies the balance of the vintage
wines all tabulated under the complex
and intricate Appellation Controle clas-
sifications. Although some of the wines
from the lesser classifications occasion-
ally come up to the greatest standard,
generally speaking there is a marked
falling away here, though the wine is
still of a high quality. I think the best
of our yearly output easily ranks with
these wines.

biere, biiru, birra. Lufthansa calls it beer
One of the unique things about the
Lufthansa way of flying is the hearty
German beer that is served direct from
the keg for those who want it.
Or the black bread and Westphalian
ham that comes sweet and pink from
the bone.
Sometimes though, such eulogy of
Teutonic gastronomy tends to hide the
fact that Lufthansa is essentially an
international airline as familiar with
flying Japanese to Johannesburg as it
is Scotsmen to San Francisco.
Lufthansa flight crews speak and
understand the kind of language you
choose to use.
Ask for beer and you get it.
With a smile because that’s the way
Lufthansa likes serving you.
Lufthansa, the German international
airline, serves most continents, most
cities that Australian businessmen
travel to.
Ask your travel agency to show you
how Lufthansa can serve you next trip
overseas.
Birra or Beer?
Lufthansa also serves fine Australian
wines.

Henry Parkes—
The Great “Hi-Ham”
This is the first in a series on the most, famous Premiers
in each Australian State
By M. H. ELLIS
IN the bitter, fog-ridden London winter
of 1838, Henry Parkes, a tall cadaver-
ous ivory turner from Birmingham,
who had been born at Stoneleigh near
Leamington, Warwickshire, three weeks
before Waterloo, decided to emigrate with
his wife Clarinda to Australia, which
seemed to “hold out prospects so bright
and cheering to unhappy Englishmen.”
He resolved on this when they were re-
duced to their last fourpence. Their deter-
mination was reinforced when they “were
for two days without anything to eat,
including Christmas day.”
So on July 25, 1839, they arrived in
Port Jackson with three or four shillings,
a son born in the turbulence of Bass
Strait, and in an “absolute state of
friendlessness.”
In 1839 he was washing sheep in the
Nepean River and reaping wheat for Sir
John Jamison out at Regentville. By
1846 he had become a tidewaiter in the
Customs and was writing both verse and
prose for Robert Lowe's weekly “Atlas”
and hobnobbing with Sydney’s young
intellectual radicals. In 1848, when the
name Karl Marx was being whispered
ominously round the world and “Com-
munist” and “Anarchist” were becoming
popular in objurgation, Joseph Fowles,
in his Sydney in 1848, depicted an ornate
“fancy wares depot” in Hunter Street
with the name “Henry Parkes” above a
many-paned window.
By that time he was also acting as
a joint campaign secretary for Robert
Lowe, an enterprising albino, son of an
English prebendary, product of Winches-
ter and University College, Oxford, where
he had taken a First in Classics, and a
Fellow of Magdalen at 23, who was now
engaged in the curious task of winning a
seat in the dying Legislative Council of
New South Wales on a programme cal-
culated to please everybody even the
Chartists without appearing on the
platform.
He had prematurely pledged support
to another candidate and thus most of
the burden of campaigning fell to )'oung
Mr Parkes who had left Dame School at
eight and whose speech contained too
many “aitches”. In the course of the
fight, having been schooled through lis-
tening to the great Midland advocates
of the Reform Bill of 1832 and youthful
membership of Thomas Attwood’s Birm-
ingham Political Union for Protection of
Public Rights, young Parkes made his
first public speech. He proved himself
to have a gift for the apt phrase, political
sense, and a turn for scourging the
politically unrighteous, though he had not
yet reached the stage of descriptive skill
at which he would describe an opponent
as a “withered tarantula”.
Fresh from victory for Lowe he began
the year 1849 by drafting a successful
petition to the Imperial Parliament to
mitigate the property qualifications of
electors in the new representative consti-
tution of the Colony, committing him-
self to the prescient forecast that “the
time will come, more quickly than some
dark prophets can foresee, when universal
suffrage will be in the possession of the
Australian people.” Then he plunged
into the anti-transportation campaign.
He helped to plan the great meeting
held in pouring rain which grimly wel-
comed the Hashemy and its convicts on
June 7, 1849. He later, at a monster
gathering in Old Barrack Square,
seconded the resolution of the great
T. S. Mort to found an anti-transporta-
tion society and he originated and
organised a fearsome petition signed by
12,000 ladies, headed by the wife of the
Chief Justice, against the resumption of
the convict system.
Democrat and Capitalist
At the end of 1849 he founded a
paper, called grandly “The Empire.”
It became a daily on January 20 of the
new year.
At once he began to savor the joys of
paradox involved in playing the double
role of democratic politician and capita-
list newspaper proprietor. For he was soon
forced to have nearly all the members of
his composing room chapel sent to gaol
for conspiracy when they met and de-
cided that his refusal of their high gold-
days demands for a certain scale of
pay should be regarded as tantamount
to their dismissal. At the same time he
was preaching the rights of the workers.
Then he had to reconcile the position
of the ardent political opponent of the
import of coolie labor from Asia and the
South Seas with that of a newspaper
owner who imported strikebreaking
Madrassi Eurasians on £4 a week (whom
he rarely paid), about half the prevailing
Sydney rate for compositors. And this
might have been very awkward, seeing
that he was about to contest the blue-
ribbon seat in the expiring Council left
vacant by the departure for England of
W. C. Wentworth.
Fortunately, however, paradox again
intervened in that the disgruntled
workers who were maligning Mr
Parkes were deprived of votes by the
property qualification which he so
wholeheartedly opposed; while plenty of
solid pluralist voters had votes and to
spare for Mr Parkes who had earned
their gratitude by proving (as the
Attorney-General had put it) that
“nothing could be more detrimental to
the interests of society than if the em-
ployed could meet together and resolve
that they would leave off work if con-
ditions which they nominated were not
complied with.”
He won, attended the Council’s every
sitting from start to finish, then hied
him to the “Empire” office where he
worked the night through “as blithely
as the golden girdled bee”—at the task
of proving to public men that “any at-
tempt (by them) to deceive, however
adroit, any backsliding or tergiversation,
however carefully cloaked, are soon laid
bare by the vigilance of the Press.”
In this highly moral task he had the
aid of a conviction that “timidity is one
of the worst of qualities in a newspaper”
and of a staff which included characters
like Angus Mackay (later founder of the
“Daily Telegraph”), Daniel Deniehy, the
Reverend Mr Quaife (later George Reid’s


tutor), and the old warhorse, Edward
Smith Hall, of the “Monitor”. These
needed no “encouragement to write
boldly” and found “no scarcity of sub-
jects for animadversion,” so that there
were plenty of heartening libel actions
and of political kudos.
He worked for universal franchise. He
worked for progress later he moved
the resolution that set the electric tele-
graph wires humming. He worked for
popular education, water and sewerage,
the foundation of the volunteer move-
ment in the heroic days of the Crimea.
He worked for patriotism, moving in
Council the resolution of congratulation
on the termination of the war. He labored
for temperance. He secured a select com-
mittee which voted to found a naviga-
tion school in Sydney, though it was
left to him to make the vote reality in
commissioning the Vernon many years
afterwards.
Disastrous bankruptcy
TTe arranged another committee to in-
quire into the dastardly habit of
squatters and others of importing coolie
labor and another to find out why a com-
munity of 227,000 people with abundant
land must import most of its breadstuff's
from South America. This paved the
way towards Sir John Robertson’s epoch-
making Land Act of 1861.
Obviously the electors did not think
him idle. Though he announced that
his parliamentary career would die with
the Council at the end of the year (1855)
when he had passed the age of 40, his
hypnotised supporters in Sydney elec-
torate insisted on electing him as one of
their members in the Legislative
Assembly in the newly-fledged represen-
tative Parliament by only 18 votes less
than Charles Cowper, who topped the
poll. It even seemed touch and go
whether he would not be in the first
ministry. But he declined nomination,
having his hands full at that time with
the acute illness of the “Empire”, in-
duced by a surfeit of libels and bad
management. It was sliding out of his
grasp in circumstances which caused its
name to become a “forbidden word in his
family and among his friends.”
Largely as a result of its calls, it seem-
ed, he was about to establish the regular
pattern which compartmented his life,
as ten years after he had entered the
active political field he went bank-
rupt for the modest sum of £58,828
3s. Id.
It was not so much his bankruptcy—
insolvency being an art practised skilfully
in his age—but its nature which seem-
ed to spell disaster. For the list of the
180 creditors proved that he had not con-
fined his operations to fair game. He had
paid nobody. His employees from maid
servants and apprentices upwards; his
landlord, his bootmaker, his surgeon, his
solicitor, the man who bound his volumes
of bad verse, his children’s tutor, his
two banks and some of his deadliest
political foes among the squatters, all
were lamenting. His days as a news-
paper owner were over, and his political
career was in dire jeopardy.,
It was a miracle that though he re-
tired crestfallen from his new seat of
Cumberland, which he had exchanged for
Sydney at the election of 1858, East
Sydney electorate rushed to welcome
him, and that after 18 months’ triumph-
ant representation of his new constitu-
ency, one of the most profane of his
creditors, Sir John Robertson, who had
become Premier, appointed him a joint
Immigration Commissioner to proceed to
England with W. B. Dailey on a salary
of £lOOO a year and suck a flood of
new immigrants into New South Wales.
In making the offer, Sir John remarked
that “it is unnecessary to describe for
you the duties of the office, as the pro-
posal sanctioned in Parliament originated
from your own motion”.
Off he went gaily to London in the
steamship Great Britain, there to charm
everybody, to hobnob with Carlyle and
his Jane, with Bright and Cobden and
Florence Nightingale; for even at that
stage when he had not reached the
zenith of his persuasive powers it seemed
that nobody could resist the descrip-
tion is Alfred Deakin’s “those mel-
low treble cadences, that amiable, per-
suasive and friendly disposition, that
resolute masterfulness and imperious
command alternating with distinguished
humility”.
After three years of touring as a sort
of conquering hero through his native
Midlands and the north and west of
the British Isles, he left many an English
friend and tradesman regretting his
return to Australia, though it was some
years before a lot of them realised how
truly material their loss had been. New
South Wales welcomed him home, in
1864, for political life had been dull
without him. A seat (Kiama) in Parlia-
ment and later in 1866 the Colonial
Secretaryship in the ministry of that ci-
devant contributor to the (late) “Empire”,
Sir James Martin, were his for the ask-
ing; but history hastened to repeat the
pattern of 1858 in September of 1868,
and again he was bankrupt, this time not
so spectacularly as last time, for though
241 creditors were involved the amount
was only £35,036 2s. 2d. But he had
reason to pride himself that £25,000 was
secured about £ll,OOO of it by a
property on which there was a mortgage
of £17,000.
The unlucky side was that some per-
sons in Parliament were not as sym-
pathetic as they had been in 1858, as
witness the summary of his erstwhile col-
league Mr W. B. Dailey:
I never wish to say an unkind word
of any living creature, but there are
characters so repulsive as to make silence
on the part of an honest man a crime ...
If he lives long enough, he will rule over
a nation not of admirers but of creditors.
“Was it”, Mr Dailey asked, “safe to
have a man of such fatal pecuniary fas-
cination in a post so large, adding to his
natural talents for procurement of
other people’s money the irresistible at-
tractions of place and distinction?”
And the people of New South Wales
fondly answered “yes”. Not only
one but two electorates, his own
Kiama and East Sydney, rushed to re-
elect him when he resigned his
ministry (the Martin Government
tumbling after him) and his seat.
It took all the joint efforts of the
ministry and the “Sydney Morning
Herald” to cast him forth as a bank-
rupt.
Fifty-six years old, his beard becom-
ing streaked with silver, he was deserted
by his friends, “many of whom had
profited by my friendship in former
days.” He had no assets left, according
to his own inventory, save a “heart
which became most buoyant and strenu-
ous in the face of difficulty.” But he tided
over an interregnum of 13 months very
well, thanks to a capitalist from South
Africa burning with an ambition to start
a daily newspaper and another who need-
ed a lobbyist to promote the foundation
of a trans-Pacific mail service.
Prime Minister at last
HPhen the raffish rural seat of Mudgee
came to his rescue and he was
back again in Macquarie Street, and in a
little over four months after his election
was observed electing from the Premieral
throne his old chieftain, Sir James
Martin, who “in the midst of defeat and
condemnation had continued to hold on
to the spoils of office”. At last Mr Parkes
himself was Prime Minister, amid the
forebodings of Mr Dailey; and Prime
Minister he remained for three luscious
years. He appointed Martin Chief Justice
and for himself accepted a KCMG.
Sir John Robertson eventually defeat-
ed him on the trivial issue of the release
of the bushranger Frank Gardiner, but
the Great Indestructible gathered his
forces, somehow merged with his
destroyer, and, after three years at the
helm, left him to act as deputy, while he
himself, still retaining the Prime Minis-
tership, embarked on an expansive over-
seas tour “because of his health.”
The President and people of the
United States received him with respect-
ful acclaim. Mr Gladstone frequently
talked with him as Prime Minister to

Idea for a new era
In 1882, at the age of 25, W. S. Burroughs gave up book-

machine that would add mechanically and obviate error.
He died at the age of 41. The long line of diverse machines
that stem from his invention is a lasting memorial to his
genius. Today, Burroughs make most of the world's
accounting and business machines.
The range includes adding machines, cash registers,

SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIA INCORPORATED
Director of Major Research Project
The Social Science Research Council invites applications for the post of Director of a major stua'y
project on "Aborigines in Australian Society". The research will be concerned primarily with the
conditions of and problems arising from the association of Aborigines and non-Aborigines in urban
and other settled areas of Australia, and the findings of the study will be published. The study
is designed as a full-scale investigation and evaluation and the appointment of a Director is
preliminary to the selection of an appropriate team of research workers.
The Director's initial appointment will be for three years but may be extended for an additional
period of up to one year if the completion of the study should require this. Applicants should be
persons of senior academic standing in a relevant branch of the Social Sciences and should
have had experience in organising a research team, in conducting field work and in preparing a major
report for publication.
The Director will be responsible to a Project Committee of the Council for the design and
conduct of the research proiect within broad terms , of reference approved by the Committee, for
budgetary management of the project, and for the selection of additional research workers.
The salary of the Director will be according to experience, and qualifications, within a range
up to that of a University Professor in Australia, at present £4,250. Reasonable appointment expenses
will be met. The funds available to the Council will also permit the appointment of a research
team equivalent to three or four persons for two years, travelling expenses for field work, and
secretarial assistance.
Further details concerning the proposed scope of the project, finances available and other
matters may be obtained from the Secretary of the Council, Box 4, G.P.O., Canberra, Australia.
Applications close with the Secretary on September 30, 1963.
Prime Minister. He hobnobbed with
the Crown Prince of Germany. Tenny-
son invited him down to Farringdon to
chat about Milton and humbly receive
autographed copies of his poems. All
this Sydney heard with pride, so that
it welcomed him with banquets and
triumphal arches when he returned af-
ter 20 months away, though a little later,
when he had achieved the longest term of
office on record, it threw him out of
office and the East Sydney seat,
leaving Tenterfield to take him to
its electoral bosom. And then, hot-
foot but feeble, he was off again to
England whence his letters told of com-
munings with Browning, Huxley, Her-
bert Spencer, Jowett of Balliol, all of
whom appeared to be his humble chelas.
No wonder that he returned home to
find himself shocked at the “state of
degradation” into which politics, un-
redeemed by the recent entry into Par-
liament of such men as Reid and Bar-
ton, had fallen in the Colony. He in-
deed took himself out of that tainted
atmosphere, no doubt to forestall the
inevitable which was once more loom-
ing, but suddenly emerged from ob-
scurity in 1885 to contest a by-election
in Argyle, on the southern tablelands.
The sight of his old traducer, Dailey,
sending away the Sudan Contingent and
earning undying eclat from the perform-
ance had proved too much for him.
Yet it mattered nothing that, as the
Fairfaxes were delighted to state, “he
was as powerless to halt the expedition
as a cur would have been to halt a
procession by yapping at its heels.” The
electorates had only to see him to be-
lieve him. Then he was enthroned
once more on the edge of the precipice
the following April, after he had driven
the largest quarry in sight, George
(“Damn Chicago!”) Dibbs, out of the
Premiership, and robbed him of his St
Leonard's electorate.
Bankrupt again
TTf. was not yet Premier. He bided his
time while the Robertson ministry ex-
pired after a life of only a few months
and the ministry of Sir Patrick Jen-
nings in less than a year. And now a
GCMG, he settled down to two years of
domination over a ministry in which he
held the offices of Premier, Vice-Presi-
dent of the Executive Council, Colonial
Secretary and Minister for Lands.
The even tenor of his career, of
course, was interrupted by you’ve
guessed it! his timely bankruptcy;
one to end all bankruptcies and doubly
exciting by reason of the fact that The
Bulletin and Phil May were on the
scene and were enjoying it to the full.
Even some of his closest admirers
were inclined to think that three in-
solvencies aggregating 499 creditors and
£148,823 were too much of a good
thing. Still, there seemed to be a cer-
tain general sympathy for the “Great
Hi-Ham,” as The Bulletin called him,
who was alleged to be countering
the quaint theory that it was only honest
to pay one’s debts with the pertinent
query: “Are there not procurers of inno-
cent women for the lowest purposes who
pay 20s. in the pound? Are there not
men guilty of the vilest crimes under
Heaven who pay 20s. in the pound?”
“Corruption at its worst”
Tn vain acquisitive opponents with an
eye on office fulminated against “cor-
ruption at its worst carrying on an
infamous traffic in the highest offices
of the State.” Who could behold with-
out pity that towering form, the tears
glistening on its silver beard in the dim
light of the East Sydney hustings, whither
he had repaired seeking absolution? Who
could listen without sympathy to that
far-carrying treble, as it made its plea
to the electors not to disgrace the Prime
Ministership of New South Wales before
the world by casting him forth, and
sobbed in utter weariness its personal
surrender to circumstances: “As for me,
it matters little. I am poor, I am old. I
stand in the light of the grave.”
His audience watched in pitying
silence as he wept himself, with bowed
shoulders, off the platform, bound for
fresh political triumphs and the beget-
ting of another son and, even at the
end, a third marriage. There was life
in the old dog yet.
George Dibbs, when he beat him at
the election of January, 1889, seemed
a tame cat beside him, especially against
the background of the new and roister-
ing membership of the Assembly which
now included red-blooded fellows like
Paddy Crick. The electors put him back
in office in October. They raised a fund
to maintain him a fund to which
his enemies said every civil servant must
contribute at his peril; for which, it was
written, “304 poor, half-starved relief
workers at National Park were docked
Is. 6d. apiece.” His benefactors were
rewarded by a spectacular term of of-
fice, his greatest. To this resurgence into
power belonged the Tenterfield speech
of October 24, 1889, which brought
Federation as an issue immediately into
the field of current politics, producing
the Premiers’ Conference of 1890 and the
Federal Convention of 1891 of which
he had justly earned the chairmanship.
That was the end. Dibbs was in again.
The Labor Party had arrived in force
after the great strikes and robbed him
of all pretence to the leadership of de-
mocracy. He was now among what Wil-
liam Charles Wentworth would have
called “the rabble,” Enemy No. 1.
The portly George Reid, even more
picturesque than himself, had succeeded
him in the Liberal leadership, earning
his immortal hate. Barton had succeeded
him in the leadership of the Federal idea
which he had always made his own,
to his intense chagrin.
In 1891 he fell out of a runaway cab
and broke his leg and never recovered
his old “buoyancy of life” afterwards.
In 1893 he was heard begging the
Trustees of the fund which had been
formed to support him and from which
he had been allowed <£7o a quarter un-
til the financial crash came, begging
for £3OO from capital to “obviate the
danger of having my personal effects
sold under process of law to satisfy the
claims of tradesmen who have supplied
me with the means of subsistence for the
past six months.”
There was still fight in him, and at the
election of 1895 he rallied with some
of his old spirit to try his normal tactics
of going directly after the scalp of his
lustiest enemy this time George Reid
in his old seat of East Sydney. He did

not succeed. His second wife died during
the campaign. He was badly defeated
and defeat left him only enough spirit
to marry for a third time before he
died in virtual beggary at the age of
nearly 81, pursued by bailiffs on his
peculiar estate of Faulconbridge on the
Blue Mountains.
It was only then that the country
really saw his stature. He had been the
greatest political figure of his age, the
most enduring since W. C. Wentworth
had deserted the field. His biography
was an epitome of the growth of the
way of life of modern free Australia
as it existed at the end of his days. He
had pioneered the fight for universal
suffrage, for the secret ballot, for Federa-
tion. He fathered the policy of White
Australia. His Public Schools Act of
1866 had laid the foundations of the
modern free State education system. His
aspirations had foreshadowed the posi-
tion vis-a-vis the Home Country, that
was given reality in due time by the
Statute of Westminster. He fought for
an elective Upper House which became
fact. It was through him that Florence
Nightingale sent the first trained nurses
to Australia. He was a father of prison
reform he could have been the first
Comptroller of Prisons under his own
plan; of water and sewerage on a colony-
wide scale, of the basic system of local
government which developed; of non-
political civil service control, of public
utilities independent of ministerial inter-
ference. He brought “loose and profli-
gate” departmental expenditures on pub-
lic works within the control of Parlia-
ment and the censorship of standing
committees. His electoral legislation
marked a vital stage in the growth of
democracy.
In the light of the muddle of his
private financial life, his steady refusal,
almost to the last, to accept grants and
testimonials from Parliament seems in-
consistent, as does his habit of resigning
from ministry or parliament on ques-
tions of principle, whilst pursuing the
most questionable tactics to keep his
private life afloat.
Strangely orderly in departmental or-
ganisation, he was personally un-
businesslike. The greatest of persuaders,
he was putty in the hands of any con-
fidence man with a tall tale and vast
coal measures without coal or with an
empire of shaggy rock and undergrowth
to sell.
But with all this he was, as Deakin
saw him at the Federal Convention in
1891, a “full-blooded, large-brained
titan whose resources of character and in-
tellect enabled him in his later years
to overshadow all his contemporaries.”

Will they or won’t they? Ever since
Peking’s 12 miles withdrawal on
the Indo-Chinese border last
autumn, there have been reports, off and
on, of a concentration of Chinese troops
in the Himalayan passes. Every time
there are Chinese military movements
there is a flurry of speculative activity in
New Delhi, and every time nothing hap-
pens there is a sense of anti-climax.
At the time of filing this report, the
Indian Press is full of warnings from
at least three of Mr Nehru’s senior Cabi-
net colleagues including both the Defence
and Home Ministers. The Chinese troops,
according to one report, are said to have
moved down from their battle stations to
forward striking positions and swarms
of Chinese soldiers and militiamen have
been sighted in the last two or three
weeks, not only on the Ladakh and
north-eastern fronts but also in the
middle sector which includes the Nepal-
Tibet border.
The general impression in Delhi is
that the Chinese have deployed nearly 13
divisions about 13,000 men on the
Indian borders out of the 16 divisions
they are supposed to have in Tibet. They
are also believed to be in a position to
bring in more troops from Sinkiang at
short notice should the need arise at
any time.
The Indian Defence Ministry is neither
ignoring these reports nor attaching un-
due importance to them. However, Gen.
J. N. Chaudhuri, Chief of the Army Staff,
was asked by the Ministry to cut short
his visit to the US and Canada and
return to India immediately. The military
planning in Delhi is said to be proceed-
ing on the assumption that the Chinese
would probably attack towards the middle
of August or by early September. They
might re-occupy the so-called demilitar-
ised zone in Ladakh and also move into
parts of NEFA.
More is known about the presence of
the Chinese than of their intentions.
China “experts”, such as we have here,
are inclined to think that Peking’s pur-
pose in precipitating a new crisis would
be primarily political—to humiliate India
further, confuse the United States and
embarrass the Soviet Union. It is argued
that the anticipated Chinese attack may
not be big enough to provoke Western
intervention but it would be serious
enough to make India look even more
helpless in Afro-Asian eyes and also
embarrass the Soviet Union at the same
time.
From China’s viewpoint, even a limited
action, sharp and swift, would be quite
tempting. India has just signed a military
agreement her first since indepen-
dence with the US and Britain, pro-
viding for joint air exercises over the
northern borders, described diplomatical-
ly as “familiarisation exercises”. Two
American and one British supersonic
squadrons involving 800 airmen and
technical personnel, will take part in these
exercises and, in addition, the US will
take in hand the installation of radar
network and connected communications
equipment covering almost the entire
northern border.
The agreement, which has had mixed
reception in India, does not commit
either the US or Britain to India’s rescue
automatically if she were attacked again
by the Chinese. They have, however,
agreed to “consult” India in such a con-
tingency. Groundwork is thus laid for
Western intervention in case of another
attack from the north and the agreement
has therefore been interpreted here as
one' providing for “air umbrella”, not a
popular word in India.
While this agreement was being
negotiated, an Indian military mission
was in Moscow it arrived in the Soviet
capital about the same time the Chinese
delegation to the recent Sino-Soviet con-
ference was preparing to return to
Peking looking for military hardware
in the Kremlin. News has now been re-
ceived that the Soviet Union has agreed
to supply India with some guided mis-
siles, radar equipment and transport
planes and that discussions are continu-
ing for the supply of several other items
in the Indian shopping list. India has
been keen to acquire some MIG-21
’planes but apparently the mission has
drawn a blank here. But the fact that
the Russians have agreed to supply radar

The“
shaver
is here !
Millions of pounds of research money
has been spent perfecting thumb-
eized electric motors which move satellite
aerials. They are powered by even smaller
energy N cells, charged and discharged by
the sun’s rays. Light in weight, but
packing a punch that lasts for years, this
•system is ideal for powering the “space
age” electric shaver.
The Sperry Division of the Sperry
Rand Corporation plays a leading role in
fcpace research. This know-how is passed
€>n to the Remington Shaver Division.
The Remington “Lektronic” is the first
and only shaver that uses space satellite
principles in order to double a shaver’s
power, while retaining a built-in recharge-
able power supply.
Men on the move can now shave when
ever they like. Only a little bigger than a
packet of cigarettes in bag or briefcase, the
“Lektronic” draws up to two weeks’ power
from the mains in a few hours.
Start shaving with “Lektronic” now.

equipment matching a similar Ameri-
can offer is considered to be a vin-
dication of India’s non-alignment policy
which, despite the recent unusual mili-
tary agreements and purchase loans, still
forms the core of Mr Nehru's approach
to world affairs.
Clutching at non-alignment with one
hand and reaching for Western aid with
the other, India would be exposed to a
painful stretch, should the Chinese de-
cide to attack again. The West, on its
part, might hesitate between saving the
detente with Moscow and sparing India
the jolt of realising that what is for her
a matter of honorable survival is to
her friends only a border conflict not
worth a complicating commitment.
Moscow, fresh from her recent ideo-
logical bouts with Peking, could pendulate
between dislike of Peking's arrogance
and the need to keep the sympathy of
other Communist countries from swing-
ing in favor of a China at war with a
nation that has just been receiving arms
from the West. In such an intense cross-
fire of doubts, jealousies and self-in-
terests, the Chinese might well manage
to get away with it all and find them-
selves, one fine morning, lodged comfort-
ably on the banks of the Brahmaputra in
the plains of Assam, within a gunshot of
British-owned tea gardens and oilfields.
It might be merely a question of tim-
ing, for the radar installations and guided
missiles are still largely on paper.
What is really causing considerable
concern here is the possibility of some
“mischief”—as it was put to me by an
Indian official in New Delhi this week
in the event of a new Chinese attack.
The Pakistani army has been expanded
in the last few months from four to
five and a half divisions. It has also a
large number of well-armed tribal irregu-
lars at its disposal. Four Pak divisions
are now deployed on the Punjab and
Kashmir borders and the rest in
East Pakistan. There has been a great
deal of trouble including sporadic
shootings near the Tripura border and
India is said to possess enough evidence
of secret Pakistani contacts with the un-
compromising Naga rebels. The Chinese,
too, are said to have established contact
with the Nagas.
Western diplomats in Delhi do not
share the Indian fear of Pakistani incur-
sions and, for once, they may be right.
During the Krishna Menon days,
Pakistan was built up by Indian poli-
ticians into a sort of national bogey
Krishna Menon still goes about the
country shouting that Pakistan is enemy
number one and this fear complex
still persists. Pakistan has been behaving
in a strange fashion since the first
Chinese attack but she has her own in-
ternal reasons for doing so. There are
no indications as yet that the situation

BIG OPPORTUNITIES AWAIT YOU
'SOUTH AFRICA
"Side-tripping” to South Africa, on your way to
(or from) Europe/U.K., is a very logical thing to
do. Firstly, it enables you to investigate per-
sonally today’s excellent export opportunities in
South Africa and her northern neighbours.
Secondly, it offers wondrous sight-seeing
opportunities (such as Kruger National Park)—
a welcome break from the beaten tracks of tra-
ditional routes. And finally, it costs as little as
£15.10.0* in extra air fares, including S.A.A.’s
Boeing Stratojet service between London and
Jo’burg. Your travel agent has full details.
S.A.A., in association with Qantas, operates

is desperate enough to call for extra-
territorial adventures.
In the ultimate analysis, India is prob-
ably her own worst enemy and leaders
like Mr Nehru are alive to this danger.
Mr Nehru's own party, the National
Congress, is as nearly in a mess as a
powerful ruling political organisation can
ever get into. At least four State Minis-
tries are in danger of collapse under
the pressure of internal feuds and the
Nehru Cabinet itself is not free from
serious ideological and personal bicker-
ings.
The opposition, such as it is, is in-
creasingly restive, all the three leading
opposition parties—Socialists, Swatantra
and Communists have tabled no-con-
fidence motions for the coming session
of the Parliament. These are admittedly
tactical moves, but nonetheless they bode
ill for a nation said to be preparing for
a war. For China, the temptation to fish
in troubled waters must be irresistible,
but in India things are never what they
seem and Chairman Mao’s men may
be in for a big surprise if they do decide
to take the plunge.
Rainmakers
At
Work
Australian scientist E. J. Smith has
taken his place in the minds of
Singapore Chinese beside the Monkey
God and the First Taoist Pope. For
Mr Smith, too, can make rain.
Faced once more with a long drought,
the worried Singapore Government this
year asked for technical help from Can-
berra. Under the Colombo Plan Mr
Smith arrived first to look the climate
over and at the beginning of last month
had an RAAF Dakota, fully equipped
for rainmaking, sent down to Singapore
from Butterworth. One morning Mr
Smith went up in the aircraft, gave two
promising-looking clouds their shots of
sodium and silver iodide, and down
came the rain. The rain-making opera-
tions continue.
The effect down below on the less
educated Singaporean was traumatic. It
is well known that in the third century
AD Chang Tao Ling, first Master of
Heaven, could call the rain and summon
the winds. For the Taoist Pope of the
Dragon Tiger Mountain in Kiangsi pro-
vince, whose descendant in the 63rd
generation still holds the title today, was
not only a noted scientist of his time,
but also a magician acquainted with the
philosopher’s stone and the elixir of life.
His talisman is still bought by eager
Chinese.
In the immortal “Journey to the
West” it is also recorded that a sooth-
sayer accurately prophesied he would
produce 3.048 inches of rain, and that
the divine Monkey ended a drought
in one country on his way to India by
producing rain so enthusiastically that
it turned the region into a swamp.
And now, Mr Smith. But for many,
the successive Masters of Heaven will
remain favorites for, dabbling in the
occult as they did, they are described
by one commentator as “laying down a
cellar of bottled spirits.”


Around Melbourne
SLACKS...WELL, YES; BERMUDAS-NO!
QJome facts should be revealed to
sensitive readers rather gently,
but I’m afraid I have to tell you
this one straight out women have
been wearing slacks at Royal Mel-
bourne Golf Club. You must under-
stand that the Royal Melbourne is
the Melbourne Club of golf. Its
record is august and impeccable. No
woman has ever been allowed to
wear slacks there.
True, Mrs S. T. Strahan, wife of a
Melbourne doctor, tried to do some-
thing about it back in 1925. The
doctor said he was sick of seeing
women’s skirts blowing in the breeze.
So Mrs Strahan had her slacks
specially tailored for golf. They were
designed almost exactly like jodhpurs.
She wore a long jacket which came,
most respectably, almost to her knees
and she wore suede boots.
And so she went out to Royal
Melbourne. She played her golf, but
when she returned to the club-house
there w'as a furore. She was told that
if she ever wore them again she
would not be permitted to play in
any more pennant matches. She says
that the older people thought they
were disgusting, the young women
giggled and the men said nothing.
“So I just had to take them away,”
she said. “The slacks were marvellous
for fishing.”
This past week, Mrs Strahan, now
the official starter for the women’s
Commonwealth Tournament, has
been able to look on with some
amusement. All over the world wo-
men have worn slacks on golf courses
for years. In the US they even go for
bermudas. In the first Common-
wealth Tournament at St Andrews in
1959 the Australians and New Zea-
landers were the only girls to play in
skirts.
So when the Canadian and Eng-
lish girls arrived in Melbourne last
week, complete with slacks, very ob-
viously trouble was ahead. What was
to be done? After an agonising re-
appraisal Royal Melbourne permitted
the girls to wear this new-fangled
garment, but no bermudas. The
Canadian girls turned out in beauti-
fully tailored green slacks. The Eng-
lish girls wore slacks that were
rather tighter, and they brought very
severe looks from some of the elder
associates. The tightest of them all
were worn by Mrs Spearman, the
Middlesex champion. Indeed, after
looking at her you got the idea that
“slacks” was rather a curious name
for this form of garb.
The Australian girls were thrilled
and immediately turned out for prac-
tice in slacks created by Mr Fletcher
Jones. Yet even now we are unsure
as to whether there has been a major
break-through. The dress for women
at Melbourne’s golf clubs is dictated
by rules laid down by men’s com-
mittees. A ring round of the clubs
has shown that at this stage they
have no intention of changing their
rules. However, the “Age” golf
writer did print this quite alarming
paragraph: “At Barwon Heads asso-
ciate members are permitted to wear
slacks with the proviso ‘that they are
removed before entering the club-
house’.”
T ast week your correspondent went
out to Royal Melbourne to make
an on-the-spot inspection of the big
tournament. It was like being thrown
into a vast feminist uprising. At this
stage there were more than .4000
women on the course and only a
handful of men. Everything was being
organised by the women. The offici-
als were all women, including the re-
ferees, the starters, the banner bear-
ers, the scorers, the parking attend-
ants, the ticket collectors; why, even
the contestants had their own per-
sonal female caddies.
The organisation was modelled on
the lines of the Canada Cup. There
was the large scoreboard outside the
club-house and the scores were com-
ing back on the second by walkie-
talkie. All the officials had received
rehearsals during the week. The ef-
ficiency of women in action was
downright breathtaking. The only
breakdown was with the toilets. The
ladies had not forecast the imbalance
between male and female spectators.
It’s not good to see a 50-yard queue
of ladies standing outside a small
toilet at the Royal Melbourne.
But all the facts and figures were
provided weeks beforehand. We knew,
for example, that most of the Can-
adian girls were college graduates
one had a Bachelor of Science degree,
no less. We knew, too, that three of
the girls were daughters of profession-
als.
Then the trophy, a globe mounted
on a stand, was there for all to see.
This was a gift from Nancy Viscount-
ess Astor, mother of the present Lord
Astor. Even this seemed to be in
the news.
The outright favorites for the
trophy were the English golfers, win-
ners of the first series. Then came
the Canadians, chiefly because of the
power of their hitting and their enter-
prise. But it was the English girls
who had the experience, particularly
Mrs R. Smith, five times British
champion, and just possibly the most
experienced amateur woman golfer in
the world.
I followed the first bout Eng-
land versus Canada. This was even
more grave an occasion than the Can-
ada Cup. The large female gallery
was as respectful as a cathedral con-
gregation.
The players were grim-faced, and
exchanged no pleasantries. They took
an unconscionable time over their
putts. At the 6th Mrs Smith was
playing out of a bunker. A movie
camera began to whirr. Mrs Smith
stopped at once, jumped out of the
bunker and waited for the whirring
to cease. Whereupon a thousand hos-
tile female eyes turned on the offen-
sive cameraman. 1 felt terribly sorry
for the poor fellow. At an all-male
affair he could have brazened it out.
Here he just shrivelled up.
Mrs Marlene Streit, six times the
Canadian open champion, was the
deadly earnest one. She had a golf
bag that would have been the envy
of Peter Thomson. It was huge. The
woods were prettily covered with
socks in the shape of dolls’ faces.
But the thing to see was the golf ball
warmer. It was battery - operated,
held two golf balls, and it brought
them to just the right temperature
for big hitting. It could be said with
justification that Mrs Streit had the
warmest drive on the course.

Three Lines
On the Nuclear Treaty
1. —A Case for Limited Optimism
By E. W. TITTERTON
(Professor of Nuclear Physics, Australian National University)
Although it is obvious that a partial
nuclear weapons test ban treaty be-
tween the UK, USA and USSR
is very must better than no treaty at all
—and we can feel quiet satisfaction that
at last an important step has been taken
in the right direction it is as well
to realise that the solution, to date, is
partial only.
To appreciate the problem still facing
mankind let us look at what the treaty
does not do. It does not prevent the
manufacture and stockpiling of nuclear
weapons. It does not prevent the de-
velopment of new weapons, even by
signatories, provided these are tested un-
derground. It does not influence those
nations like France and China who
choose to ignore it. And, lastly, it does
not touch the problem of disarmament
or the vital problem of war itself
whether this be fought by conventional
or nuclear methods.
But even with these limitations the
treaty can be very useful. As far as
the Big-Three are concerned it will cer-
tainly slow down the development of
new bombs and weapons systems. For
example, missiles carrying nuclear war-
heads cannot be fired in the atmosphere
or outer space; nuclear depth charges
cannot be tested in the oceans; anti-
missile interceptors relying on nuclear
explosives cannot be tried out, and so
on.
It is suggested by opponents of the
treaty in the USA that these facts mean
that the West has “dropped its shield”
in particular that the West will be
at a disadvantage in the anti-missile
missile race. There does not appear to
be real substance in this claim. In fact
both Russia and the US have already
fired nuclear bombs carried to great
heights by rockets. The treaty still al-
lows development of such missiles to the
maximum of what is possible. It merely
prevents the final addition of the nuclear
warhead in an overall test.
As far as nuclear weapon testing is
concerned the treaty means that mega-
ton bomb testing will be virtually stop-
ped. To completely contain the explosion
of a one-megaton bomb underground
it would be necessary to bury it about a
mile deep. This would be a formidable
and expensive operation and it is doubt-
ful whether even the major nuclear
powers would consider it to be worth-
while.
The testing of small kiloton weapons
underground could be continued and
this would produce no radioactive fall-
out and so would not be open to objec-
tion on that score.
To increase confidence and goodwill
between each other it would have been
impressive if the three major signatories
had refrained voluntarily from even such
small tests. Unfortunately political pres-
sures in the USA from the critics of the
treaty, who claim that the West is now
at a disadvantage, have caused President
Kennedy to counter that America will
continue weapon development through
further underground tests. This undoubt-
edly will mean that the USSR will fol-
low suit.
However, there can be no doubt that
the Kennedy Administration shares the
strongly expressed British belief that a
complete ban on all weapon testing is
desirable as soon as possible. The major
difficulty which has prevented this more
satisfying type of agreement arises be-
cause there is only one method of de-
tecting a bomb fired deep underground
• by the seismic waves produced in
the earth’s crust and these can be con-
fused with earthquakes. In fact without
an inspection system it would not be
possible to distinguish with 100 per cent
certainty between an earthquake and a
very small bomb. It is only differences
of opinion on the number of inspections
within the Soviet Union to satisfactorily
police such a ban which has prevented
agreement.
Recently, however, there has been a
major breakthrough in seismic detection
techniques by a group working at the
Atomic Weapons Research Establish-
ment in the UK and this should go a
long way towards solving the difficulty.
The new device, involving an array of
detectors, information from which is
processed by computers, has already
been thoroughly tested at two stations.
One, built at Eskdalemuir in Scotland,
is so sensitive that it picked up with
surprising ease explosive charges as
small as 300 lbs fired in the North
Sea. The second of the British stations
is located by agreement with the USA
at Laramie in Wyoming and is conveni-
ently placed to “listen in” on the weapon
tests at the Nevada proving grounds.
A third station is now being com-
missioned in northern Canada, while
a fourth station has been suggested for
central Australia.
One of the stumbling blocks in the
way of an underground test ban was
the initial belief that 180 stations, many
in the USSR and staffed with large
numbers of personnel, would be neces-
sary to police the ban. Already results
from the new British experiments show
that a total of 20 stations suitably placed
around the world could detect explo-
sions down to five kilotons however
deeply the bombs were buried (the Hiro-
shima bomb was 20 kilotons). Such un-
derground explosions can be pinpointed
to within 6 miles of their origin. More-
over the stations are not expensive; they
cost about £lOO,OOO each and have small
running expenses since only four or five
men are needed to operate them.
Installation of such a detecting net-
work would reduce Western demands on
Russia for stations and inspections with-
in the USSR and should greatly aid the
extension of the present partial test ban
treaty to include underground explo-
sions. We might, therefore, look forward
in the relatively near future to the next
step of a complete ban on all nuclear
weapon testing. This would be an even
bigger and more satisfying move for-
ward.
/General de Gaulle has made it abun-
dantly clear that France intends to
have its own nuclear weapon stockpile.
He gives as his reason the belief that the
USA would not automatically come to
France’s aid with nuclear weapons if
she were attacked.
This is probably only a part of the
story. French scientists started work on
the nuclear project before World War II
and some of them were smuggled out
to the UK to continue work after France
was overrun by the Germans. These
scientists later worked at the UK-Cana-


dian project located in Canada and
made a valuable contribution. France
was bitterly disappointed, therefore,
after the war at the American-British re-
fusal to share with her their nuclear
know-how and this played a large part
in the French decision to “go-it-alone.”
Already she has tested a number of
bombs in the kiloton range and will,
no doubt, continue this programme. To
avoid censure in the future she may well
decide to test small bombs underground
so as to avoid fallout problems. How-
ever, French scientists are now well on
the way to developing bombs in the
megaton range and there is no doubt
that they will proceed to test at least
one for only then would France
qualify as a fully-fledged member of
the nuclear club.
The first such bomb can be expected
to be a big one and “dirty” from the
radioactivity point of view and it will
almost certainly be tested in the Pacific.
Cost and the need for a wide variety of
scientific measurements dictate that it
be fired above ground on one of the
atolls and there will be a substantial in-
jection of radioactive material into the
atmosphere. Already fears have been
expressed in New Zealand and Australia
about the fallout, but this will not be
biologically significant in either country.
Red China, unlike France, has not yet
exploded a nuclear bomb of any kind.
There has already been kite-flying by a
number of magazines but China still
lacks the technological and industrial
capacity to become a major nuclear
power quickly.
If a full treaty between the nuclear
Big-Three can be achieved we can reason-
ably expect that most nations of the
world would sign such a treaty with
relief. We might then find that the pres-
sure of world opinion would force
nations outside the treaty to come into
line.
2. —Will Nuclear Weapons Spread?
By GEORGE MODELSKI
(Author of “Atomic Energy in the Communist Bloc.”)
For a number of years it has been
common knowledge that the con-
struction of nuclear weapons holds
no secrets to those intent upon it, and
that up to a dozen countries might, in
the near future, elect to join the nuclear
club because they have the nuclear
capacity to do so.
The difficulties experienced by Britain
and France in launching their own
nuclear armories have shown that this
may be much too simple a view of the
situation, and more arguments against
it are in a timely new book, “The
Spread of Nuclear Weapons,” written by
Leonard Beaton and John Maddox, the
defence and science correspondents of
“The Guardian.” Beaton and Maddox
supplement the familiar facts of tech-
nical capability with a review of the
other considerations which enter into
a decision to become a nuclear power.
The most important of these are
economic —the large and continuing
costs, about £A6OO million, some three
times the annual Australian defence
budget, for a complete weapons system
including the rapidly obsolescing de-
livery vehicles; strategic —the danger of
provoking your probable opponents into
an arms race; and political —hostility,
both international and domestic, the
latter an important consideration in a
country such as Japan.
Their main conclusion is that the spread
of nuclear weapons is by no means
inevitable. For the decade or so ending
in 1975, this is undoubtedly valid in view
of the various obstacles toward acquiring
weapons, combined with the necessary
delay of about ten years before a decision
to build can yield results—unless an
“option” (i.e., the preparation of some
facilities such as materials, teams of
specialists, and delivery vehicles) has been
taken out at an earlier stage. Sweden and
Israel among others are believed to be
taking out such options.
Despite its anti-nuclear line in inter-
national affairs, India's nuclear develop-
ment could be ahead of China’s. As part
of its advertised plan for developing the
electric power industry, India has created
a fully self-sufficient nuclear base that is
independent of the control of any other
power. Its large thorium deposits serve
as the foundation of an indigenous
uranium industry; the first ingots of
natural uranium were produced in 1959
and large-scale production is to start
this year. Fuel element fabrication began
in 1959, too, and considerable effort is
made to produce heavy water within the
country. In the research establishment
at Bombay three reactors are now
operating- and one of them, built with
Canadian help, could be used to provide
the fissile materal for two or three bombs
a year if the choice was made to run it
primarily for the production of weapons
grade plutonium. The programme is now
moving from research to power pro-
duction and a large atomic power station
is firmly planned for the mid-60s.
All these facts are consistent with the
announced intention to develop the
nuclear industry as a new source of
industrial, primarily electric, power. But
one further element of it attracts atten-
tion, and that is the early construction
of a plant for the processing of spent
fuel and the extraction of pure fissile
plutonium from it. The fact that this
plant was to be ready for operation early
in 1963 makes it possible that India
could produce a nuclear explosion by
1963. In 1969 her industrial nuclear
power programme should be producing
substantial quantities of weapons grade
plutonium.
More obscure is the position of Red
China. On the plea that it was not
possible to go to Peking, Beaton and
Maddox claim that nothing can be said
reliably about the decisions taken there
and they adduce only weak evidence for
their conclusion that a Chinese com-
mitment to a weapons programme must
be placed around 1957 or 1958 and
that a nuclear explosion is to be ex-
pected after 1963. More than this is
available in print on Chinese scientific
planning.
Earlier Western estimates stressing
the strength and the import of the
Chinese programme have now been re-
vised; the new optimism has found
unexpected reinforcement from Mr
Khrushchev, who spoke disparagingly
of China’s industrial potential. Indeed,
the recent official statements from
Peking seem to hint at some postpone-
ment of target dates, placing the attain-
ment of a nuclear status in the “not far
distant future.” In China, as in India,
the weaknesses may concern not so
much the strictly nuclear but the
delivery parts of the weapons system;
the absence of sophisticated aircraft or
missile industries.
The one point that is beyond doubt:
The first nuclear explosion might have
been put off from 1963, but, unless the
regime itself collapses, China’s size and
her resources make it certain that, in
the end, the attainment of a complete
nuclear weapons base as a road to inter-
national influence is only a matter of
time.
eaton and Maddox are right in
stressing the obstacles to the spread
of nuclear weapons, a process that must
be reckoned not in years but in decades,
but their enthusiasm for confining this
spread may have beclouded their judg-
ment of the long-term development at
issue.
To start with, there is an element of
inexorability in this development. The
acquisition of the weapons is irrevers-
ible — once armed you cannot be dis-
armed and the number of armed
powers can only go up but not down.
Nuclear weapons, too, are but a small
part of the equipment of a modern
state and, with continuing economic
growth and industrialisation, most of the
world’s independent states will ultimately


be in a position to build, and also
to afford them. Further, federations
and political unions (e.g., in Europe)
might bring into existence large new
units perfectly capable of maintaining
expensive weapons systems, and the
costs and risks of these weapons could
be a powerful stimulus for such unions.
More importantly, the spread of
nuclear arms is not a statistical process.
First, each single new entrant to the
nuclear club creates pressures for widen-
ing it. Thus, as Beaton and Maddox
point out, “a Chinese bomb, especially if
wielded belligerently, is bound to have
far-reaching effects on India, Japan and
even Australia.” Second, the present
spread of atomic weapons is part of the
process of recasting the structure of
international society. Holding or aiming
at such arms are states who aspire to
high international status. In the past not.
more than five to seven states were at
any one time admitted to such a role
and anxious and able to fill it and they
alone possessed forces which could be
regarded as strategic. That is why not
more than five to seven nuclear powers
are required to make the present system
fully nuclear. If we take the USA, the
USSR, possibly “Europe,” China,
India and one or two other powers, we
ma y have the likely system of the
1970 s or 1980 s. From such a corn-
bination of the major states any small
power would be able to procure its own
tactical nuclear arms if it needed them,
Viewed in this light the international
system could attain nuclear saturation
within two decades.
3 .— No Peace with Communism
By SALVADOR DE MADARIAGA
No objective appraisal of the situa-
tion created by an agreement
about nuclear tests can be valid
that does not begin by acknowledging
it as a success. For the first time, the
great nuclear powers agree on something.
What the technical value of this
something may be is a matter for the
experts; but its psychological import is
obvious, and no one should minimise its
beneficial effects. The most beneficial of
all might well be the blurring or destroy-
ing of the false image of the Western
powers built up for Soviet public opinion
by official Communist propaganda, which
presents them as ' imperialists and
aggressors.
On the other hand, it is precisely on
its psychological aspects that such an
agreement may be dangerous for the
free world; for it may increase the all
too widespread tendency to imagine that
an all round and substantial agreement
with Moscow is possible; and, as this is
not so, it might lead public opinion astray
from a realistic appraisal of the con-
flict.
Why has the Soviet Union consented at
this stage to this modest though signi-
ficant agreement? There may be two
motives at work. One is the wish to
slow down the space programme, owing to
its astronomic cost for both sides. The
other is the fear lest the Sino-Soviet dis-
pute encourages the European satellites
to give way to the longing for indepen-
dence from Moscow which their peoples
find it hard to hide, and their Govern-
ments harder and harder to repress.
This is a delicate point, and one which
the Western powers should carefully
study. Peace is a magic word, and every
Western statesman dreams of coming
towards his home crowd crowned with
olive branches rather than with laurel
leaves; but it would be a bad day if,
for the sake of an olive-branch triumph
in New York or in London, a cloud of
black despair were to be let loose over
the Eastern European lands. What if Mr
Khrushchev had come to the conclusion
that it would pay handsomely to let tests
go, to let even Western inspectors come
and count his tanks, provided it became
clear to all concerned that the Western
powers acknowledged Moscow as the
capital of the Soviet-European empire?
Would not that be the best explanation
for the eagerness Moscow does not con-
ceal to attract to the Kremlin for the
signature of the treaty the most exalted
Western figures it possibly can, President
Kennedy himself and, if not, at least Mr
Dean Rusk?
This quid pro quo would always have
been disastrous for both the security and
the honor of the West; but, at this junc-
ture, it would be disastrous also for its
commonsense. For the situation beyond
the Iron Curtain is becoming singularlv
fluid, and no one knows, not even the
Soviet dictator, how it is going to develop.
The mood is no longer receptive for an
operation such as Mr Khrushchev him-
self let loose on Budapest in the autumn
of 1956; and there are one or two coun-
tries beyond the Iron Curtain which are
getting restive. Nor is the Soviet Union
itself quiescent and passive under Com-
munism.
This is therefore by no means the
moment to be yielding and soft-hearted
towards the Kremlin bosses. It is, on the
contrary, the moment to raise the price
of freedom. The danger is that a chorus
of tired minds may begin to chant a
paean to peace at any price; that a kind
of chain reaction of agreements may set
in, forgetting the essential point which
is that the Soviet Union leaders will
never let go their determination to hold
fast to what they possess and to get hold
of as much as they can grasp of what
they do not as yet possess. With his
usual mujick wit, the Soviet dictator
expressed it recently referring to East-
ern Germany. “You will never see a
liberal democratic Eastern Germany any
more than you will see your own ears.”
That is the point.
Disarmament, control of nuclear
weapons, and a permanent peace, and an
end to the cold war require the disap-
pearance of Communism, at any rate
from control of Russia. This is the hard
truth that should be constantly repeated
by ali leaders in the free world. It is not
merely futile but contrary to the inter-
ests of permanent peace to try to come
to some basic and general agreement
with the Communist Party in control of
the Soviet Union: for the Communist
Party will never give up its aim, which
is the sovietisation of the whole world
beginning with that of Europe either
directly or by way of Africa and South
America; and therefore any and every
move it may consent to will be con-
ceived and carried out with that ultimate
aim in view.
It takes a very cool temperament to
lead the West in the cold war. More than
ever the chances of the free world look
brighter, and its possibility stronger of
winning this protracted struggle. What is
wanted now is so to act that while the
Communist Party is not strengthened by
frontal opposition the free world is not
drawn away from the moral basis on
which rests its own case against the
Communist empire of the Soviets.
It is, for instance, little short of shame-
ful that countries such as Britain, France,
Belgium and Holland should meekly
accept to be dragged to the dock at the
UNO Assembly, Council and Commis-
sions, to answer for that “colonialism”
to which (along with many admittedly
black memories) their accusers owe their
very capacity to accuse, without any of
these ex-colonial powers formally pre-
senting a tile of the shameless develop-
ment of Soviet colonialism in Asia from
the Urals to Vladivostok.
But, of course, it is even more im-
perative that in its eagerness to agree
with Moscow the free world should do
nothing that might even seem to con-
done the Soviet colonial empire in East-
ern Europe. We hear a good deal about
not recognising Eastern Germany (and
even about recognising her!) but we
should be constantly repeating that the
Soviet hold over Eastern Europe is not
a situation which the free world will
ever put up with.


LETTERS TO THE
EDITOR
M. H. ELLIS AS CRITIC
Sir,
Max Harris (10/8/63), in attacking
my reviewing of two Oxford booklets
on Governors King and Bou r k e
(27/7/63), follows what seems to be
the universal method of critics of my
reviewing that of substituting abuse
and imputation of unworthy or dishon-
est motives for a straight answer to my
strictures. Nothing in the booklets sug-
gests that they are written for children
“at higher primary school level”, and
they are sold by booksellers among
ordinary Australiana. If they are directed
to adolescents, my criticisms are all the
more valid. The authors, post-graduates,
senior university lecturers, adopted by
the Austs.Lga National University as
among the most knowledgeable of bio-
graphical authors, were obviously briefed
to write accurate biographies at what-
ever level they wrote; and if they wrote
for juveniles who are apt to adopt for
life errors propagated by their teachers,
the need for accuracy was the greater. If
they purveyed major inaccuracy they
were all the more open to attack and
correction.
As for my calling the booklets “bro-
chures”, the “better to lambaste my
enemies”: (1) the word “brochure” was
used merely to indicate the nature of
their binding; (2) I personally like Dr
Roe and do not know Dr King, and I
do not accept the self-protective con-
vention that appears to be established in
Australian academic circles that severe
and just criticism of a work by a uni-
versity lecturer calls for the reviewer to
be lashed and ostracised for the “dread-
ful” offence of contradicting teacher. In
this case, the reviewer has a duty to
teachers at primary level who are apt to
propagate the errors of university aca-
demics who pose as authorities.

CIRCUS ANIMALS
Sir,
It was most gratifying to read the
title of your article “Death of a Circus?”
(27/7/63) but the subject matter was
disappointing. It would have been more
satisfactory to read the title with a full
stop instead of the mark of interroga-
tion. Not until public opinion declares
itself against the exploiting of animals
in a circus, can we call ourselves a
civilised people.
In your article there was not one
word of protest against the cruelty
which everyone knows is part of the
circus business. At Hobart, during the
visit of one circus, I went to see the
animals on the Queen’s Domain, and
in no cage was there room enough for
them to move about freely, and the
only time they leave these confined
spaces is when they are brought into
the ring. The elephants were chained
together, only moving from one foot
to the other during the whole time I
spent there.
“To the casual eye, scanning the
newspaper reports, the circus is finished
here already.” If this be true, then we
are on the road to becoming a civilised
people.

GARDEN ISLAND
Sir,
The article headed “Strike at Garden
Island” (20/7/63) mentioned the Com-
munist domination of some unions. It
said that the Electrical Trades Union,
whilst not being Communist-controlled,
had as its representative at Garden
Island a member of the Communist
Party.
At Garden Island this union has four
shop stewards who are the representa-
tives of the union on the job, and this
statement does a great disservice to those
members of the union who are not
Communist Party members. The rep-
resentative referred to has been de-
feated in a recent ballot, and there are
now no representatives at Garden Island
who could be said to be members of the
Communist Party.
C. O. DOLAN
Secretary (NSW Branch), Electrical
Trades Union of Australia.

MR SANTAMARIA
Sir,
I wholeheartedly agree with Mr
Thomas Moore (27/7/63) that the pub-
lic is entitled to an accurate description
of a product, even a political one, on
offer to it. This, of course, would apply
equally to Mr Santamaria’s products as
well as my own. The "labels, as Mr Moore
chooses to call them, used by me in my
letter of July 13 were readily made
available from Mr Santamaria’s appar-
ently inexhaustible stock, complete with
after-sales service. In attempting to make
a case for the NCC brand, Mr Moore
foolishly overlooked the fact that I
quoted Mr Santamaria’s own statements
quite extensively. If, as he claims, I did
not match the labels with the contents,
the misrepresentation and inaccurate
description of the product on offer
is rightly a matter for the manufacturer,
Mr Santamaria, to correct, as it was he
who supplied me with most of the labels.
Although Mr Moore begs every one
of the 10 mostly hypothetical questions
he raises, he coyly discusses none him-
self. This is an old debating lurk design-
ed to get out of a complicated situation.
With this in mind I proceed to comply
with his request:
1. As the results of NCC elections, if there
are really any, never reach the news-
papers, the public are not in any position
to decide if anybody, let alone Mr
Santamaria, is democratically elected.
The 2nd, 3rd, sth and 7th questions
posed are broadly in the same category
and can be answered together. The
methods employed by the NCC are most
definitely dictatorial. The expulsion from
the DLP of Messrs Leo Mahony and
Kevin Walsh of the Melbourne Univer-
sity DLP Society because they wanted
to put to the 1960 Victorian DLP State
Conference a motion which condemned
the NCC, and for requesting that forth-
with all DLP members be prohibited
from being members of that body, is
typical of the NCC dictatorial methods.
The excesses of the NCC, which
directs the Groupers, can again be readily
seen from a copy of a letter from the
Santamaria-supported Mr Gus Alford
which appeared in the “Waterside” organ
of the Waterfront Groupers, on July 20,
1961. In a most dictatorial manner Mr
Alford wrote: “As far as I am concern-
ed I have no doubt that I must be declar-
ed as General Secretary and I claim to
be entitled to the position immediately.”
Only a few weeks previously Mr Alford
was overwhelmingly rejected in a clean
ballot.
When Mr Moore asks if Mr Santa-
maria ever commented on the “Bombay
Examiner” articles, it appears as if he
“did not get the mail”. I, therefore, sug-
gest he read the “Catholic Advocate” of
December 6, 1956, and he will see for
himself.
It is ethically wrong to persist in
using a Catholic TV programme or a
Catholic newspaper to sponsor one
political party. Victorian Catholics are
continuously fed DLP propaganda and a
vindictive personal campaign is simul-
taneously waged against the ALP by Mr
Santamaria not the Catholic Church
itself.
I consider that Mr Theo Cochrane was
maligned by the NCC over the recent
Victorian ARU election. Clear evidence
of this is seen in the “News Weekly” of
June 26, 1963. Under a large heading
it claimed that Mr Cochrane’s ALP team
had split the anti-Communist vote and
claimed it contributed to the victory of
the retiring executive. Yet the edition
dated July 3, 1963, gave the percentage
vote of the three tickets as Unity 58%,
Industrial Groups 38%, ALP (Coch-
rane) 4%. This is surely a blatant case
of NCC distortion and misrepresentation.
As Mr Santamaria is president of the
NCC, he must accept some responsibility
for attacking a sincere anti-Communist
who is at the same time a loyal ALP
man.
As for the tenth and final point made
by Mr Moore, I suggest that no large
organisation, unless it’s the NCC or the
Communists, get anything like their full
membership at all their meetings.

ART
Sub-Human Forms
The brutishness of British sculpture
By BILL HANNAN
Recent British Sculpture. National
Gallery. Melbourne.
William Peascod. Maurice Carter
Argus Gallery. Melbourne.
Australian Photographic Society’s Ex-
hibition. Melbourne.
HPiie British Council’s exhibition of
Recent British Sculpture should be
seen several times. Nine vital and im-
posing sculptors are represented by five
works each, and some by drawings as
well. Most of the works come from
the late ’fifties and the whole gives a
strong and well-rounded picture of the
mature work of the most important
national group in modern sculpture. We
have never seen anything of this quality
here before.
Why Britain should produce such an
extraordinarily powerful group of sculp-
tors, virtually without any tradition, is
hard to imagine. However, at least in
part, the two pioneers represented here
-—Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth
—must take credit for giving a lot of
the impetus. In the post-war period
Moore established that the mixture of
disillusion and relief which followed war
could be expressed in an enduring form.
The shock which human hopes suffered
could not be played down, yet at the
same time there was real value in the
experience. In their various ways most
of these sculptors record a similar
experience. We have perhaps by now
become fairly familiar with their sensi-
bilities, and adapted traditional notions
of beauty to new ways of thought, but
it is still obvious to anyone that most of
this sculpture is closer to brutishness
than to humanity. It obliges us to accept
harshness and blindness as part of life,
and invites us to see beauty rather in
non-human or sub-human forms.
These must be taken only as very
general impressions. Within the nine
there is a lot of variety. Probably the
most general trend is a formal one,
awav from sharp linear sculpture to
solid monumental figures. Moore
especially, and to a lesser degree
Paolozzi, Chadwick, Dalwood and
Armitage, seem to want the solid
permanence of a monument. Possibly
this reflects a greater security than was
felt a decade ago and it certainly con-
veys a strong conviction of the dura-
bility of organic life. The youngest of
the nine, Dalwood and Paolozzi, stretch
further still towards permanence by
creating wondrous and enigmatic objects
which excite rather than alarm.
It is in the treatment of living things
that this generation of sculptors is most
menacing. Moore’s concentration on
huge, blind, organic forms, which elevate
life but cut down individuality seemed
to set a theme which in some way is
picked up by Butler, Chadwick,
Meadows and Armitage. Butler here is
shown in two phases, one which cele-
brates the grace of young bodies, an-
other (“Head”) which reveals extreme
tension characterised by the clash of
sharp lines and heavy, blunt mass.
Chadwick is the supreme exponent of
“edginess” and infuses in all his figures
a sharp sense of unbalance and enmity.
Meadows’ natural figures birds and
crabs are frankly harsh and prickling
as though in extreme pain. Armitage is
less brutal but his human figures are
nonetheless reduced to formal essentials
and have a grotesque bulkiness which
pays no respect to ideal conceptions of
humanity. Only two of the nine come
close to geometric abstraction. Barbara
Hepworth bases her smooth, elegant
rounded shapes on natural objects and
may be considered abstract in the sense
that it is above all the form of the object
that interests her. Robert Adams aims
at pure geometry, both in light linear
pieces and in small chunkv masses. The
range, in short, is such that the show
must be seen several times. It will be
in Melbourne until August 25.
At the Argus Gallery the English-
born painter William Peascod is holding
his second Melbourne exhibition. It is
an advance on the first in that he does
not rely so much on surface texture
and the quality is more even. Heavy
textures are still characteristic of his
painting, but it is working now much
better on other levels.
Peascod’s painting is a sort of com-
promise between sculpture and land-
scape. Normally our eyes convey also
some impression of texture as well as
color, shape and dimension, and Peas-
cod seeks to translate this fact into
paint. At close range one’s impressions
are predominantly of surface textures.
From a distance they look more settled,
handsomely composed and calmly
balanced. Some of his landscapes are
industrial, and all have the appearance
of waste and exploitation. Without dis-
torting the nature of his materials
rough, charred and unprepossessing
he does uncover a dark beauty in them.
It is unromantic landscape but genuinely
in touch with common experience.
Maurice Carter, who is incongruously
grouped with Peascod, is much closer
to romanticism. His answers are simpler
and he swaps uneasily from the primitive
to the portentous. Far too many issues
are seen in conventional social realist
terms, and too many painting problems
are covered over by strident colors.
Certainly one may appreciate both his
warm sympathy for people and his con-
cern for their condition, but he lacks
the means to make his point tell.
At the Australian Photographic
Society’s convention Stan Ostoja-Kot-
kowski showed some of his first experi-
ments in painting with light. At the
moment he is experimenting with ab-
stractions inspired by electronic music.
Given the resources, it seems that paint-
ing, like music, could be produced by
machines. At present Ostoja works with
lights, filters, reflecting media and film.
The possibilities of extension, however,
seem immense, to the point where, for
example, music played electronically
could be used to determine color and
composition in a painting. The first
results I thought were highly successful
and the idea has all the imaginative
excitement of a peep into the future.
Shadows and
Reflections
Rolf Sackenheim. Carrick Gallery.
Tasmania.
An exhibition of 32 hand-prints by
Rolf Sackenheim is now on view at
the Carrick Gallery in Tasmania.
A member of the “Junge Westen”
group, Sackenheim is one of Germany’s
best-known graphic artists and is gene-
rally recognised as leader of the younger
generation of German printmakers. He
has had nine one-man shows in Germany
and Holland, and has been represented
in numerous exhibitions in art centres


throughout the world. This, however, is
the first time he has had a one-man show
outside Europe.
For ten years he studied drawing alone,
and his work reveals that typically
North European passion for line, per se,
which is evidenced in the graphic work
of such artists as Differ, Rembrandt,
Seghers, Klee, and others. Thus he ex-
periments extensively with etching —-
using it either purely or as a basis for
adventures into quasi-lithographic tech-
niques, in which he ad libs with a variety
of materials: cut paper, stencils, card-
board, lino and aluminium. Such plates
achieve a considerable density of tone,
and frequently only one print is made of
the final state.
None of the prints is titled: for me they
seem to approach music. The pure etch-
ings are a delicate filigree of line that
may evoke an intimate conversation of
strings: chamber music of Haydn. The
slightly larger over-printed plates, with
their richly inwoven tapestry of shadow
and line, are impressionistic tone-poems:
Delius perhaps, or Debussy. Often one
appears to be looking from a cave, a
dim window, along an irregular corridor.
Light filters in through a recession of
semi-transparent shapes. Everything is
calm, orderly; and informed with a quiet
interior life that somehow soothes and
satisfies.
The collection will be shown at Car-
rick for several weeks; after which it will
be sent to Melbourne and on to other
centres.

TELEVISION
Crane’s Blue
Vacancy in Vaughan St. John Crane.
Channel 2, Sydney.
old dilemma again. Should a first
effort at television drama be gently
criticised, or should the frosty truth be
written about it? The answer seems to
lie in a further question: Who benefits
from sunny criticism? It enables weak
shoots to survive, and they have been
the Patterson’s Curse in our culture for
too long. Few good artists of any kind
wilt under criticism. Many accept it as
part of the fight. It’s much worse to be
ignored.
So I hope John Crane, dramatist, Bob
Cribbage, producer, and Bernard Hines,
designer, will all come out for round
two despite any derogatory remarks
about “Vacancy in Vaughan St.” from
the ABC Television studios, Brisbane.
It was a trite little 30-minute play about
a lonely carpenter who came to board
at Mrs Jessup’s charitable institution.
At least that’s what Mrs J. seemed to
be running. With only four boarders she
could offer a menu. And TV, radio-
record player, piano, and lashings of
good-looking furniture. By the scale
of the boarders’ living room, she would
have been lucky to clear her rates from
the profits.
Anyway the carpenter had an im-
mediate choice between a plump out-
going woman and a schoolmistress who
had been studying under Greta Garbo.
As presented, any bloke in his right
mind would have been most willing to
let her be alone, but our carpenter found
her irresistible. This led the other wo-
man to bare her soul to him, in a
speech that might serve as a classic
example of unlikely dialogue from any
woman, anywhere, any time. “Ah, Vi,”
said our hero, “we can be friends but
nothin’ more.”
Ernie the carpenter succeeded in
breaking through the schoolmistress’
reserve. In a speech to boarder No. 4
he described her fanatic attempts to im-
prove him, boss him, change him all
of which naturally drove him to drink.
Visibly, it also made her wear tight,
slinky dresses. But one afternoon he
ambled in, molo, and said what he
thought, and they lived happily ever
after.
Mr Crane has the right idea. He was
after simplicity, and good dramas have
been written on apparently threadbare
plots. But simplicity is the hardest real-
ism to achieve in drama. Mr Crane
failed, partly because he forgot he was
writing for television, in which the
camera can often tell a better story
through the actors, with little dialogue.
The producer must also be blamed for
not throwing out much of the talk and
making the actors carry the story. The
designer should have looked inside a
suburban boarding-house.
There is a place for 30-minute drama,
and it is good to see Brisbane coming
into production. “Vacancy in Vaughan
Street” was not an awful failure. Nor
was it good enough to inflict on tele-
vision’s viewers.
FRANK ROBERTS
THEATRE
Glitter
The Rehearsal. Jean Anouilh. Mel-
bourne University Dramatic Club.
Union Theatre. Melbourne.
“HThe Rehearsal,” like so many of
A Anouilh’s plays, is about the irre-
concilability of love and the world.
While spending a month in the coun-
try, the Count (Tiger) and the Countess
(Elaine) and their guests are rehearsing
Marivaux’s play “La Double Incon-
stance.” The situation of these people
is similar to that of the characters they
act in Marivaux’s play. Throughout the
play they are dressed in eighteenth-cen-
tury costume, ready for rehearsal.
In the first act it seems that Anouilh
is writing a brittle comedy in the style
of the eighteenth century, although set
in modern times. The characters are
aristocrats, rich and idle, who have
nothing to do but amuse themselves.
Their society is elegant, sophisticated
and civilised. The guests at the chateau
include Hortensia, the Count’s mistress,
and Villebosse, the Countess’ lover.
In the second act the play changes to
romantic comedy. Into this worldly so-
ciety comes Lucille, a little governess,
who has been asked to play the heroine
in '‘La Double Inconstance.” The Count
falls in love with her. For him she
represents true love, genuine feeling,
purity. He decides that his old life was
empty and boring and that he will turn
his back on it.
But in the third act the play changes
once more, to melodrama. The Count-
ess forestalls her husband. Her instru-
ment is the Count’s friend Hero, a
failed romantic. In his youth he loved
a girl like Lucille, but was persuaded
by the Count not to marry her, for
worldly reasons. Now he has his re-
venge. Urged by Elaine, he seduces Lu-
cille, having first told her that Tiger is
tired of her and has asked his friend
to take her off his hands. In the morn-
ing Lucille runs away and Hero ar-
ranges to get himself killed in a duel.
Love has been defeated by society.
But this aristocratic society seems
so anachronistic even though this
anachronism is cunningly blurred by
the period costumes and so melodra-
matically wicked, that the conflict be-
tween it and the palely pure devotion of
Lucille does not seem to prove anything
about love and the world.
The trouble is that, in the confusion
between the eighteenth century and the
twentieth, the issue becomes confused
as well. In the days when the aristocracy
still had power and importance, the
little governess would have known her
place. But, more important still, the
Count would have known his place: the
Countess would have had no fear of
losing her husband to a governess. What
Lucille represents to the Count is not
just the charm of romantic love but the
charm of democracy. Because she has
to earn her living while he has only to
amuse himself much harder, as
everyone knows her life seems to him
to have meaning and purpose, whereas
his own seems empty. What this play
really illustrates is the problem of be-
longing to a defunct aristocracy in a
democratic society.
Peter de Berenger’s production and
Peter Wood’s sets and costumes achieved
the eighteenth-century atmosphere very
well, and in spite of their youth the cast
managed to convey something of the
diamond hardness and glitter of this
society.

old-style Western. It is set in modern
Texas, and Hud himself is in most
superficial respects the typical tough,
resourceful, two-fisted Western hero.
But as the film develops it becomes
abundantly clear that Hud has no heart
of gold, and at the end he is left to
face alone the realisation that in the
modern Lone Star State he is just a
nuisance.
We are introduced to Hud first as
a careless womaniser and bar-room
brawler. But the main business of the
-plot starts when his father’s cattle be-
come infected with foot-and-mouth dis-
ease. Hud wants to cut losses by selling
the cattle quickly outside the State; his
father will have none of that, calls in
the “Government men” and stands by
stoically while all his cattle are de-
stroyed.
This incident not only underlines the
contrast between Hud’s freewheeling
selfishness and his father’s austere sense
of right and wrong; it brings to a
crisis the corrosive antagonism that has,
we gather, existed between them for
years. Hud exploits the case to try
to have his father legally deprived of
the ranch; the father loses heart and
dies; Hud is left in command of the
empty property while his young nephew,
who earlier seemed ready to make a
hero of him, walks out in disgust.
As a picture in the quality of its
direction, acting and photography
“Hud” is just about a total success.
Director Martin Ritt’s narrative tech-
nique challenges no conventions, but
it is always crisply effective and econo-
mical; he is not of the school that
considers that longueurs are necessary
to make a film seem important. The
sequence of the cattle slaughter makes
a jolting impact.
The setting, with the weatherboard
town in the plains, the square, func-
tional homestead and the dusty cattle
yards, seems uncompromisingly authen-
tic (much of it, too, looks almost dis-
concertingly Australian).
Newman’s performance is compel-
lingly good. Appearing first as an al-
most likeable young rake, he steadily
strips away the surface charm until
there does not seem to be a redeeming
feature left yet at the end it is hard
not to feel some sympathy for Hud in
his empty victory.
Brandon de Wilde, a former child
actor who seems to perform with equal
competence at each successive age level,
makes a profoundly sympathetic charac-
ter of the adolescent nephew whose
loyalties are divided between his grand-
father’s solid virtues and Hud’s glamor.
As the shrewd, acrid-tongued house-
keeper who observes and finally becomes
violently involved in these conflicts of
character, Patricia Neal contributes an
individual and sharply realistic charac-
terisation; Melvyn Douglas has the aus-
tere, homespun dignity that the screen-
play requires of the figure of the grand-
father. But this character is less con-
vincingly drawn than the others.

rp H E human sacrifice is still with us.
A Originally, the king was the sacred
victim whose death would appease
the gods and renew the fields. Then in
his place a criminal or a stranger was
substituted; a daring innovation it must
have been. When the religious signifi-
cance of killing criminals faded out, it
was still a handy way of disposing of
them. Decapitation was messy and re-
served for ceremonious occasions. Then
the Western world advanced to the idea
of using criminals as a warning. This
was cloudy thinking. Only the most
timorous poacher was deterred by the
sight of the remains of other poachers on
gallows a sufficient distance from the
village so that the odor was not too
noticeable if the wind turned.
While Americans still burn the human
sacrifice by electricity, there are faint
stirrings of thought. Would it not be
better, scientists argue, to keep criminals
in cold freeze, contributing an eye for
an eye, a kidney for a kidney, avail-
able at all times for advanced medical
techniques and the pharmaceutical manu-
facturers?
But these thoughts are suitable only
for the cheaper horror comics in
whose atmosphere modern man is more
and more immersed not the primeval
village in which the Agatha Christie
school of writers have their Better People
play eenie-minie-mo for the murderer.
Here the detective story preserves the
regal sacrifice (the Squire, Sir James, old
Lady Cholmondely) while the Detective,
once a stern and faceless Inspector from
the Yard, is also a Noble Person. So he
should be, when you consider that he
was once The Messenger of the Gods
revealing just why the noble victim
who had committed some sin offensive
to the gods, had to perish.
A person often killed is The Stranger,
who has always been fair game. In demo-
cratic America, millionaires or other
wealthy symbols are a common sacrifice.
Next come beautiful young women —the
gods were always partial to them. The
detective in America does not depend
on birth or status. He relies on the
reader’s respect for him as sun-bright
Apollo, disillusioned and clear-thinking.
He is set apart by inhuman quickness and
contempt for money the last a truly
supernatural trait. The private eye finds
bodies like a bird-dog, arousing justi-
fiable suspicion among cops that he put
them there and sometimes he has.
Raymond Chandler and Gardner tried to
establish the principle that the Detective
is morally unassailable. Mickey Spillane
degraded the formula of the murder
mystery, as did Peter Cheyney, into a
mere fertility rite. The publisher Victor
Gollancz, one of the greatest purveyors
of the genre, has been guilty of introduc-
ing an academic, intellectual tone. But
with a current list, of over 200 detective
titles no one has done more than he to
provide the symbolic human sacrifice.
/Consider a stray sampling chosen al-
most blindfold. It does not matter
where the murder is set. Germans enjoy
the urban crime of Sydney in transla-
tions of stories by Margot Neville just
as much as the Israelis who have her
detectives, Grogan or Manning, in Yid-
dish. An American engineer in Green-
land will tranquilly accept Pat Flower’s
detective who likes Sydney’s Hyde Park
and is patriotic about eating our national
meat-pie or Upfield's Napoleon Bona-
parte as we accept the American sleuth
who bullies suspects and police (in
Yoho, Pa.).
Have changes in writing affected the
detective story? Almost any element can
be added or subtracted, provided the
reader finds the body. No one is expected
to cry; the appetite for the symbolic
sacrifice is enough. Some recent publi-
cations give evidence.
In “The Dead Men of Eden” Merle
Grayland could not have a more
prosaic scene than a raw suburb of
Auckland where a killer strangles first
one, then another, with a clothesline. A
rather dumb Maori and a faceless In-
spector pool information. It is always a
mistake to select, as the killer, anyone the
reader has come to like. This is where the
hard American story scores because it
is difficult with most of them to like
anyone. You can concentrate on the de-
tection.
Rex Stout in “The Gambit” offers one
of the classic style, in which Nero Wolfe
by pure thought about a situation proves
that only one person could have killed
a young man playing chess blindfold in
a rich man’s club. Stout knows that the
motive most acceptable for murder is
money and the desire to preserve status.
He always gives Nero Wolfe such an
eccentric character, with his foil Archie
Goodwin as comedian, that he only need
sketch in the puppets who must be knock-
ed down in turn.
The idea of arousing pity for any of
the deceased would negate the whole
tradition of the sacrificial victim. In
“Creeping Flesh,” by Douglas Rutherford,
a stranger is murdered before a journal-
ist whose brother has been caught up in
the drug traffic. At least four more are
killed before the drug traders are foiled.
The story is decked with all the latest
gimmicks the underground Metro in
Paris, nightclubs, the Bureau of Nar-
cotics, torture. It shows the traditional
police helplessness until the Solitary
Man, with his bravery and cunning, out-
wits and unmasks the hidden fiends. The
preservation of society is an ancient
motive.
“Doctors Also Die,” by D. M. Divine,
and “Operation Doctors,” by Holly Roth,
crop up to remind us that doctors, now
in the highest income bracket, are also
surrounded with an aura of respect and
dread that makes them the equivalent
of the King-Priest. The former book has
a love interest which should never be
necessary and sometimes drags a false
trail in an irritating way. In most ship-
board murders at least one person dis-
appears mysteriously overboard by night
as a sacrifice to the sea but
“Operation Doctor” has the substitute fall
into an empty swimming pool. No less
than four doctors are killed but the end is
cheating. The theme is the preservation
of society against unseen powers of evil.
With “The Doubly Dead” Elizabeth
Ferrars brings us back to the English
village. The solution of the crime depends
on the time an empty milk bottle was re-
moved, some flowers were procured, and
trifles of domestic life. One may fretfully
enquire whether women writers of de-
tective stories have lowered the tone.
They lose the breezy, gusty male smash-
through and are more niggling with the
bodies.
In “The Deadly Joker,” by Nicholas
Blake, Netherplash Cantorum, the tradi-
tional murder-village, is set with a

Stranger King in the form of a rich
industrialist who has bought out the
squire and his brother. Old Squire is a
practical joker. When some very nasty
incidents anger the ex-king of the village
the anonymous “I” who tells the story
assists the Inspector.
Among the sample dredged at random
was “Count Down for Conquest,” by
Berkeley Gray. These “Conquest” stories
are among the worst of their kind, on
the edge of the greasy chaos of maga-
zines with murdered young women on
the jacket complete with dagger. Nor-
man Conquest combines the more stupid
elements of outworn class snobbery
underlings address people as “governor”
with fantasies of a young superman
always surrounded by riches and women.
It lies outside the. true path of the murder
mystery.
And what is this path? Straight down
the middle of the human race memory.
Dress it up as you will, the element of
human sacrifice is still there.

Greatness
The American Establishment. Rich-
ard H. Rovere. Hart-Davis. 31s.
Thus book draws its title from a
chapter which spoofs those who
overrate the significance of “Establish-
ments.” It is not about “Establishments”
at all. Probably Richard Rovere could
not write a book on the “American
Establishment” if he tried, since he
believes neither in the existence of a
fully operative “Establishment” nor in
the cocksure kind of approach that such
a word suggests. He recognises the
mysteries that confound those who
engage in politics and those who talk
about it.
For this reason he can make great
fun of those who hold that events are
always determined by conspiracy. He
does an easy wrecking job on General
Macarthur’s mad belief that Maclean
and Burgess organised his recall by
Truman. He also attempts a much more
delicate analysis (too delicate to sum-
marise here) of the theory that the policy
of the US during and after World War
II was significantly determined by Com-
munist penetration of the US Govern-
ment. He concludes that “it is possible
to conceive of the history of the past
20 years (of US administration) as"
having been exactly what it was without
a trace of Communist influence.” This
may be overstating it, but it is at least
possible to believe, in examining the
Yalta Conference, for example (as
Rovere does), that Hiss was a Communist
spy and was justly gaoled and, neverthe-
less, to believe that Yalta might have
been just as disastrous if Hiss had not
been in the US delegation. The weak-
nesses of US policy came from a whole
complex of horrors (including Right-
wing horrors), not merely from crypto-
Communists.
Rovere makes his best points against
conspiracy views of society in his dis-
section of the late Professor C. Wright
Mills’ “The Power Elite.” Mills went
overboard in his suggestion that an
“interlocking directorate” of military,
business and political chieftains made
all the major decisions in the US. This
total view has pleased those who like to
find conspiracies and simple answers but
can no longer accept Marxist certitudes.
Yet, as Rovere points out, the argument
has one flaw. Factually it is wrong.
Mills gave four examples of US
decisions that were basic to his argument
but made no attempt to discover how
these decisions were made. Rovere
establishes that, however they were
made, they could not have been made by
an interlocking directorate. He rightly
concludes: “I would suppose that if a
man working in any of the physical
sciences offered a doctrine of cause and
effect in this way he would have been
hooted out of the academies.” Un-
fortunately, in the Social Sciences (or
whatever they are) it is often the
generalisers who won’t get down to cases
who are most adored by the woolheads;
indeed, without them whole fields of
intellectual life might not be possible.
However, Rovere is not merely a
blind-forces-of-history man. His chapter
on “political sophistication” allows im-
portance to political judgment. His view
of “sophistication” is both conservative
and radical. It is conservative in the
sense that the “political sophisticate” is
concerned only with the possible, rather
than the ideal, with the appraisal of
potentials rather than the elaboration of
fantasies. His view is also radical in the
sense that the “political sophisticate”
surveys the potentials and looks for
chances for change; he wants to get
something done, to act in so far as
events will let him. Those who make the
boldest reckonings “have seen and
sought the outermost limits of the realm
of the possible.” They include not only
Roosevelt; unfortunately they also in-
clude Hitler at Munich and Lenin at the
Finland Station.
“The true political sophisticate knows
what the options are and how much of
what is desirable is attainable. (If his
gift is of the highest order, he knows
how much of what is attainable is desir-
able.)” Sophistication has nothing to do
with chic or with being on our side
(McCarthy had it as much as Woodrow
Wilson); success is possible without it
(Eisenhower didn’t have it); failure is
possible with it (Robert A. Taft had it
to a high degree). Those who call them-
selves conservatives are not necessarily
sophisticates. However good some of his
aspirations, John Foster Dulles confused
rhetoric and bustle with power and
possibility. Those who call themselves
reformers may be sophisticated. (Martin
Luther King is both a sincere reformer
and a good operator.)
Lack of concern with consequences
can be the most dangerous fault of the
non-sophisticates. “There are ideas that
positively ooze goodness and are alto-
gether within the realm of the possible,
yet are unacceptable on the grounds that
their consequences would be awful.”
Rovere gives the example of unilateral
nuclear disarmament admirable in
intention, attainable, yet disastrous in
consequence. “Its fatal programmatic
weakness ... is that it ignores the basic
facts of power.” He also says: “The
spectre that haunts several continents
today militant international Com-
munism, supported by intercontinental
ballistic missiles with atomic warheads—•
is to a large degree founded upon the
gullibility of men and women of
irreproachable social morality and a
high level of intellectual sophistication.”
In the American fashion Rovere’s
coolness of judgment occasionally grows
clammy when he finds symbols of
innocence and decency, or their
opposites. For this reason his judgments
on Wendell Willkie and Harold J. Ickes
drop down to something less than
sophistication. Because he has decided
that Willkie had “charm and verve and
candour and generosity and a high sense
of decency,” he writes a prose poem
about him that does not impress. On
Ickes he goes into reverse. He admits
that “no scandal ever touched Ickes, and
he was perhaps the best administrator
Roosevelt had.” But after reading Ickes’
“Secret Diary” he decided that Ickes
was secretly selfish, vindictive, sus-
picious, servile, disloyal, overwhelmed
by a lust for power, changeable, petty.
Faced with this, Rovere is merely re-
pelled, instead of looking for the lesson.
The lesson is surely that what matters
in a public man are his public actions
and their sequel. Some personally appal-
ling people may be great public men.

The Hidden Worlds of Polynesia.
Robert C. Suggs. Cresset Press. 31s.
TFheory has played so great a part,
A knowledge so little, in the compila-
tions of Polynesian history that the
advent of teams working to scientific
method in the related fields of archaeology
and social anthropology must be expected
to reverse some of the old assumptions.
Probably the more permanent value of
this work of Dr Suggs lies in the record-
ing of some of these reversals. They are
not many, for there was a sovereign value
in the verbal histories the Polynesians
themselves kept sacred, but they are signi-
ficant.
Dr Suggs conducted archaeological in-
vestigations in the Marquesas Islands in
tandem with anthropological studies
that probed deeper than the average,
beginning in 1957 a year that will
be accounted significant. Before that
time, archaeology in Polynesia had been
confined to Hawaii and New Zealand,
but since then discoveries have been
made in Tonga, Samoa, Tahiti, Moorea,
Easter Isla-nd, Rapa Iti, and Pitcairn.
One surprising finding is that the
Marquesas group seems to have been
settled directly from Tonga or Samoa by
the early voyagers, and not from the
nearer groups, the Society, the Tuamotu
and the Austral. This is a direct blow to
the widely accepted ‘Tahitian dispersal
theory” dealing with Polynesian origins.
Another concerns the deterioration and
final disappearance of the potter’s art in
the Marquesas. For no good reason it
has been lightly assumed that people who
have once learnt the art of pottery never
forget it; but the pick and the spade
showed beyond doubt that the first Poly-
nesian settlers of the islands were good
potters who used local materials; that the
craft fell into disuse and disrepute, and
that it was finally neglected.
But a mare immediate reaction to “The
Hidden Worlds” must be evoked by the
sense of excitement and adventure which
Dr Suggs has managed to transmit. He
was working in a field practically un-
touched. A wealth of archaeological
material was available and his problem
frequently was to choose between one
promising site and another. He was also
a friendly individual, and obviously
established warm and close relationships
with the Marquesans he enlisted to help
him. He barely mentions the hardships
that must have assailed him as he worked
in the sea-caves of the brooding islands
or uncovered the village architecture in

the hot valleys, but they must have been
legion. He reveals himself, in short, as
a thoroughly decent, gregarious fellow
whose enthusiasms are infectious. A
reader’s first emotion, as he reluctantly
turns the last page, will frequently be
regret that his own life-work is not in-
volved with some such endeavour.
From his many discoveries Dr Suggs
proceeds most cautiously, abstaining
from advancing any far-reaching
colonisation theories to replace those his
work has disturbed. In only one matter
does he leave himself obviously open for
criticism, and that is when he claims that
his results upset “ . . . the Kon-Tiki
theory advanced by Thor Heyerdahl,
whereby all Polynesians are Peruvian
Indians who drifted into the Pacific on
big balsa rafts and there met Indians from
the Canadian northwest coast.”
The fact is that the Kon-Tiki theory
never was tenable, and never was serious-
ly considered by the best authorities. Dr
Suggs has devoted some time to critical
consideration of the Kon-Tiki theory in
the past, in his book “The Island Civiliza-
tions of Polynesia.”
His researches were of the type that
seek to establish a working knowledge,
not only of the regal and priestly
memorials of a people, but of the whole
race in all its strata. While the enterprise
to date must be regarded as no more than
a beginning, it is a significant one. “The
Hidden Worlds of Polynesia” will surely
stand as a textbook into the years ahead.

Tohn Paolotti, author of “The Return
of the Snow-White Puritan,”
writes with elegance, force and a wicked
sense of fun. The theme is one that has
been used many times, but his approach
to it is new and refreshing.
Richard Trevallion, a tobacco-rich
American ex-army officer, returns to
Italy 18 years after the end of World
War 11, to ease his guilty conscience
by inquiring into the welfare and where-
abouts of Maria, with whom he had a
brief but passionate encounter between
battles.
Toni Podezza (self-proclaimed great
poet) works for a tourist organisation
and is given the job of escorting Treval-
lion during his stay and of finally ar-
ranging a meeting between the erst-
while lovers.
The story unfolds through Podezza’s
eyes. His Italy is alive and his charac-
ters are startlingly vivid and believable.
Podezza does everything brilliantly; he
can’t help it. He is brilliant and, with
no shilly-shallying whatsoever, he tells
us he is. With dauntless frankness he
admits to his handsome appearance and
his great talents as a poet. With gravity
he announces: “ . . . I am grave, tender,
. . . gay, sometimes reckless ... I love
wine, company, laughter . . . Most of
all I love women and I am loved by
them.” Instead of merely sitting beside a
young girl on the beach, Podezza flings
his “lithe body to the sand ...”
Perhaps millions of men see them-
selves as brilliant, handsome, devilishly
lithe and attractive, but it takes a Po-
dezza bravely to announce these facts
and it also takes a John Paolotti to
present an Italian like this as a believ-
able and lovable person.
Maurice Edelman has been a highly
accomplished professional writer for
some time. His latest book, “The Fratri-
cides,” is set in Algeria: the story covers
the last desperate weeks of struggle
during which the OAS, an underground
body of French civilians and dissident
soldiers, fight to the death, brother kil-
ling brother, to keep Algeria French.
To suppress the OAS, the French Gov-
ernment employs undercover agents
known as barbouzes, or “false beards.”
Each faction believes passionately in the
cause they fight for, and Frenchman
fights Frenchman with an unrelenting
hatred and savagery.
With a chillingly detached pen the
author conveys the ugliness, tension and
moral dilemmas that spring to the fore-
front as a civil war is fought. In “The
Fratricides,” sudden death, mistrust
and bloodshed are as much a part of the
daily round as eating breakfast or buy-
ing mimosa from the Moslem flower
vendors.
“Welcome to Thebes,” by Glendon
Swarthout, is the story of an infamous
case of multiple rape. Sewell Smith re-
turns home morally and financially
bankrupt after oaving both tasted and
smelt the sweetness of success as a
famous novelist.
Back home, memories of scarifying
events in his youth also return, with a
vengeance. He begins to delve into the
moral climate of his township. Fate
inadvertently hands him the opportunity
and the means to terrify a group of
elderly local leaders, who are, one and
all and without the others’ knowledge,
deeply involved with Carlie, a 15-year-
old girl.
As Sewell’s plans evolve (with a harsh-
ness that leave one gasping) we learn,
in backward glances and revelations, the
secrets and behavior-patterns of the
town’s inhabitants. Readers, enjoyably
shocked, will press on feverishly to the
book’s brilliant and completely un-
looked-for ending.
Charles E. Israel’s fourth novel, “Who
Was Then the Gentleman?”, deals with
the Peasants’ Revolt of 1381.
Salisbury, subtle, world-weary church-
man, and Walworth, bitter, ruthless Lord
Mayor of London, lead the opposition
forces. Facing them are Wat Tyler, a
man of obscure origin but undoubted
courage, along with John Ball, known
as “the mad priest of Kent,” a stubborn,
gentle dreamer. Subtly, the author con-
trasts the characters of these four men
from vastly different backgrounds; they
have much in common and each one,
had he thought of doing so, could have
seen his counterpart in the other.
This is a novel with not one import-
ant climax, but two. The first, the his-
toric confrontations of the two forces
at Mile End and Smithfield; the second,
the complete and tragic collapse of the
revolt.
Burning, plundering, pillage and riot
and sly intrigue are dealt with at a
leaden pace. The dialogue is more in
keeping with present-day suburbia than
England during the reign of Richard 11,
and this acts as a buffer to the impact
of an otherwise readable and enlighten-
ing book.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Reduced Purchasing Power?
A Monthly investment circular from a Sydney broker,
published before the Budget, suggests that Australia’s
balancing act on the knife-edge of near-perfect price
stability may soon be over. It quotes a survey by the
First National City Bank of New York which measures the
decline in purchasing power of various world currencies. Aus-
tralia, although showing no depreciation in purchasing power
in 1961-62 and less than a 1 p.c. rise in 1962-63, should suffer
no shame “if an increase in the
general level of prices of no
more than, say, 1.5 p.c. is
the concomitant of stronger
growth.”
Based on the conclusion that
satisfactory growth and price
stability are incompatible—and
evidently indicating that
stronger growth now lies ahead
the appeal of equities is
greatly enhanced, the broker
claims.
The share market, with its
pre-Budget rise, evidently took
a similar view. The rise was
claimed to be the continuation
of a trend rather than a new
phenomenon. “It has taken place
without any significant buying
pressures from overseas invest-
ors, indicating that the market
has sufficient domestic strength
to more than sustain these levels
as growth ensues.
There is no denying the rise
was helped by forecasts of a
favorable Budget.
Most investors would agree
this is so, following Mr Holt’s
optimistic statements and the
remarkable success of the bond
market.
“But it would be wrong to
suggest that present share prices
are not justified by the perform-
ances of companies, per se, in
their present economic con-
text.”
Not everyone will agree with that. The share market usually
looks ahead six months and it would appear that because of
the reduced bond rate, increased public works programmes,
and a favorable setting for a Budgetary stimulus, investors
are trying to anticipate the future rather than pay their money
for past performances which, like some of last season’s shows
on Broadway, were not up to the usual standard. Too often
the latest company results, although improving, are compared
with the difficult period which followed the November, 1960,
credit squeeze.
If Australia’s period of price stability is now to be replaced
by a period of “satisfactory growth”, it is interesting to com-
pare the First National City Bank’s Indexes of the value
of money between the period of 1952 to 1962, which are
shown in the accompanying table.
The bank believes this decline in money value sets a higher
floor on interest rates than would obtain in conditions of
price stability, for fixed-term lenders will certainly take into
account the prospective capital
loss.
But, if Australia recently re-
duced her fixed interest rates
during a period of stability,
isn’t it likely that the fixed
interest rate will rise again
during the predicted period of
“satisfactory growth” and
higher equity prices?
Modern “Stags”
Need Cash
HPhe limited number of public
company flotations and
share placements makes the
“stag” work hard for his capital
profit these days. The tendency
of the underwriting brokers to
handle only sure things, with at
least five years’ audited figures,
encourages the investor to get
up to all sorts of dodges to get
his name on the list of favored
applicants.
Professional investors over-
seas, faced with income tax
higher than in Australia, are
creating the need for tighter
security checks within brokers’
offices, particularly in London.
Because of the scaling down of
applications, or even balloting
for the allotment of shares in
a popular issue, multiple ap-
plications from investors (by
applying for separate parcels of shares in the names of
nominees) are accepted as part of the normal routine Tight
screening helps to keep these down to a reasonable minimum.
Closing this loophole, however, encourages investors to
make larger individual applications for shares, based on the
theory that a large application, when scaled back proportion-
ately, would still give the applicant a satisfactory allotment.
Only problem about this technique is that many applicants don’t
have sufficient idle cash in the bank if the cheques are cleared


before the letters of allotment are sent out, London brokers
report.
Applicants for large parcels of shares usually rely on the
technique that 5 p.c. or 10 p.c. of the application is allotted
and that a cheque for the unsuccessful balance of 95 p.c.
or 90 p.c. is returned by the broker together with the letter
of allotment. If the broker or the issuing house deposits the
applicants’ cheques after making the allocations, there may be
only a slight delay before an applicant receives his refund
cheque from the broker. This is banked quickly. The applicant
also can sell the shares specified in his letter of allotment and
bank the proceeds immediately. By this time the applicant’s
cheque may have been returned with “Refer to Drawer”
stamped on it.
When re-presented the cheque is honored. In this way it is
claimed that professionals can participate in new flotations or
placements without using any capital.
The extent of this operation was revealed in July when a
firm of London brokers held up the letters of acceptance
and refund cheques until all applicants’ cheques had been
cleared. They discovered that £stg. 187,000 of cheques could
not be collected. As a result, the shares were re-allotted to
underwriters.
Investors, in their own defence, say that even if you have
from £2OOO to £SOOO in cash to spare you still would have
only a slim chance when applications of up to 5000 shares
quite often are put in a ballot
box. And applications for more
than 5000 shares usually are
scaled back to 5 p.c. of the
total applied for. This en-
courages a natural tendency to
overapply. Baxters (Butchers)
for example was oversubscribed
25 times last month and it was
reported that Cazenove and
Co., the handling brokers, re-
peated its technique of clearing
all cheques first.
Other London brokers, in an
effort to limit the rash of over-
subscriptions, are reminding
clients that every application
for shares represents a docu-
ment enforceable at law, which means that the writer of the
cheque can be sued for the full amount.
It is getting to the stage where the Stock Exchange may
be asked to rule that all cheques covering applications for
shares should be cleared before letters of acceptance are
posted, or that applicants be requested to draw a banker’s
order.
Australia has not reached such a situation yet, but there
have been instances where applications were pruned severely
and refund cheques sent out.
Italy’s Trade Picture
Looks Clouded
The visiting Italian Minister for Foreign Trade (Senator G.
Trabucchi) has spoken mildly, even a trifle complacently,
about the prevailing state of Australian-Italian trade. He
expressed himself “reasonably satisfied” with its trend.
As the diagram on this page shows, the balance falls
heavily and continuously in Australia’s favor. Over the full
1961-62 year, for instance, Italy bought from us goods valued
at £52.3 million. Our corresponding imports totalled £14.5
million.
Trade Between Australia and Italy
The latest available figures for 1962-63 (to May) suggest
a fairly considerable narrowing of the gap with Australia’s
exports then standing at £40.4 million and imports at £18.6
million.
Italy’s principal purchase is fine wool for the quality textile
industry to make her our third largest wool customer behind
Japan and the United Kingdom. In return, Australia takes
engineering and industrial equipment, heavy machinery and
motor vehicles.
Senator Trabucchi’s apparent satisfaction would most likely
sound far less comfortable when he came to have more detailed
talks with the Department of Trade in Canberra. For the
present overall Italian balance -of - payments situation must
plainly be causing him some concern.
His need is to push Italian exports as much as possible.
Italy’s economic development has, of course, furnished one
of the most prominent examples of a postwar “miracle”.
Among its many achievements was to bring a sizeable trade
deficit into balance by 1954 and then hold it continually in
surplus. That is, until quite recently.
Now Italy faces an increasing deficit and not on current
account alone. The first quarter of 1963 saw accelerating
imports joined by a deficit on capital movements. The trade
reversal has been strikingly swift.
To complicate the drive for exports, Italy has also to sustain
industrial growth while wages and other costs repeatedly press
upward. All industrial and
agricultural wages rose by
about 2 p.c. on August 1, as a
result of cost-of-living adjust-
ments, the second rise during
1963.
Most sources still agree that
Italy’s long - term expansion
seems certain despite cost prob-
lems. More exports have to be
won to finance part of this
growth.
All this must be conditioning
Senator Trabucchi’s first-hand
exploration of Australia. Per-
haps as well it provides part of
the atmosphere leading Italian
industrialists to become “more
interested” in investment here.
Top Advertising Agency
To Have Computer
increased billings have caused George Patterson
Pty Ltd, the largest advertising agency in Australia, to
undertake further mechanisation, and a contract has been
signed with IBM Australia Pty Ltd for a 1440 computer. It
is believed that this is the first advertising agency outside the
USA to sign such a contract, and, according to the London
Financial Times” of July 24, only six computers have been
installed or ordered by advertising agencies.
George Patterson’s Australian billings in the past 12 months
have risen by £550,000 to a total of more than £6,850,000.
These figures are exclusive of the Patterson interest in the Far
East or any capitalised fees.
The computer will be used for accounting, the agency’s own
research, and for campaign and media planning and the buying
of all types of media.
Patterson has always claimed it was the first advertising
agency anywhere in the world to put in an automated account-
ing system. That was done 12 years ago.
Mr L. W. Farnsworth, managing director of Pattersons,
anticipates that the year ahead will show further progress and
larger billings than for the current record year.


The Case Against a Restrictive
Trade Bill
No.3 -Vagueness, Confused Purposes, Arbitrary Curbs
By ROGER RANDERSON
No clearly-defined national purpose
such as encouraging greater pro-
duction —the only effective way to
keep prices down can be discovered
among the conflicting formulae for
interfering with businesses, which jostle
together in the measure proposed by the
Federal Attorney-General.
It is indeed a remarkable piece of
intended legislation which fails to reveal,
within itself, where the Government
wants to lead the nation.
This objection is serious enough, but
to it must be added another, from which
the gravest social consequences would
almost certainly flow.
Sir Garfield Barwick admits that he
has devised “the most comprehensive”
system of this kind to control private
enterprise. At the same time he is quite
unable to inform Parliament and the
electorate how, in which direction, and
to what extent particular businesses,
their owners, their public officers and
their employeis would be affected.
Plainly, the Attorney-General does
not know how his scheme would work
out in practice. The simple reason is
that he would allow officials the
Registrar, the Commission, the Tribunal,
his own department and their numerous
and expanding staff —to make policy,
besides administering it.
Two of his own admissions, although
couched in terms of under-statement,
draw attention to this far-reaching
source of arbitrary power—dangerous
not only for businesses, but also for the
nation, including all those people whose
well-being is dependent on the success
of business concerns.
“No doubt,” says Mr Attorney, “ex-
pressions such as ‘against the public
interest’ or ‘contrary to the public
interest’ lack complete precision and
inevitably leave some room for policy-
making in the individual or body which
has to apply them to the particular
facts.”
Add to this his observation before
the Hobart legal convention last Janu-
ary: “a decision that a practice is
justified in the public interest must
necessarily depend to a large extent on
matters of economic opinion, which
often cannot be predicted with any
degree of confidence.”
The business world will find no
crumb of comfort in the latter state-
ment, especially if they are acquainted
with the opinions of so many present-
day economists, whose assumptions
based on inadequate observation and
experience proceed, sometimes by
elegant logical processes, to absurd con-
clusions.
For these and similar reasons the
NSW Council of the Institute of Direc-
tors had sufficient cause to identify the
project, through its spokesman, Mr John
Dunlop, as follows:
• By enthusiasm out of theory.
• Legalism its godfather.
• Conceived in academic shades.
• Uncertainty and confusion its
most notorious progeny.
There is an “almost complete absence
of definition,” as Mr Dunlop stated and
illustrated.
Vagueness, which is the dominant
characteristic of the present proposals,
would inevitably give carte-blanche to
officials to make private businesses
dance to the tunes they devise and
vary at will.
The Attorney-General’s technique of
advocacy is interesting. He forestalls
criticism by first stating that he sub-
scribes to an acceptable principle. Then
he casually amends the principle, claim-
ing, however, that he has not altered it.
After this, he proposes courses of action
violently opposed to his original principle.
SIR G. BAR WICK
For example, he told the Hobart legal
convention that “healthy and vigorous
free enterprise will confer greater
benefits on the community as a whole
than with an economy tightly controlled,
and largely participated in, by Govern-
ment”.
A “free economy,” he next said, re-
quires limits to be placed on “agree-
ment,” “large aggregation of property”
and “market advantage,” because of the
power they give to persons or groups.
Finally, he represented the appoint-
ment of officials to pry into, ban and
direct even the minutiae of business
arrangements as leaving enterprise free,
healthy and vigorous.
Competition, or the striving among
businesses for the patronage of the
public, must operate within a frame-
work of social order. Liberal thinkers
insist on this. But there is a world of
difference between the general con-
ditions set by monetary stability, liberal
import policy, taxation, patent and com-
pany law, which are the features of
“competition policy” in a free society,
and the arbitrary socialistic dictation
that Sir Garfield proposes.
Business simply cannot know, under
his scheme, how competitive it is sup-
posed to be. Price-cutting, a normal
incident of competition, would have to
be avoided lest it attract the attention of
official investigators, wanting to know
if it was done at a loss, and intending
to drive a competitor out of business.
If this is to be a crime, it is absurdly
inconsistent to find businesses which
refrain substantially from competing
(whatever that may mean) guilty of
further crimes.
How can “competition,” or more
appropriately “enterprise competition,”
best be defined? The description coming
closest to a definition, which appeals to
me most, is that of Frank H. Knight. He
is one of the able thinkers among
economists.
“Competition,” Knight wrote, “is
simply the freedom of the individual to
‘deal’ with any and all other individuals
and to select the best terms, as judged
by himself, among those offered.”
Free enterprise will disappear if the
individual freedom which is an inherent

part of competition is curtailed. It
cannot survive if officials single out
some businesses for restriction on one
ground, and other businesses for restric-
tion on perhaps an opposing ground,
thus inhibiting the dealings of all
businesses.
It is claimed, in the usual disarming
manner, that the Government has not to
any extent based its approach on the
view that “mere size of a business
undertaking” is an occasion for censure
and a challenge to dismemberment.
Why, then, are mergers and take-
overs of firms besides companies (in-
volving all but negligible aggregates of
capital for these days) to be unlawful
and punishable if not registered and
approved in advance?
Why, too, are businesses at each stage
of their expansion likely to be held up
by officials who challenge them on the
ground that they are thereby “acquir-
ing” power to influence market prices,
or to prevent competitors undertaking
similar expansion? It is obvious that the
proposals to restrict so-called “monopo-
lisation” are a threat not only to large
enterprises but also to all rapidly ex-
panding businesses.
Surely the Menzies Government
wants the nation's production to in-
crease, and surely it wants the nation’s
industries to become as productive as
their much larger competitors overseas.
If it does, then it had better realise
before it is too late that the larger the
business unit the greater the scope for
economies of scale, whether in the pro-
duction or distribution of goods and
services. Business units expanding to
assist a nation that aspires to greatness
are the principal instruments for im-
proving the standard of living of the
masses. They must also increase in size
to improve national capacity to export
and to stand up to import competition.
These proposed provisions, if they are
not an actual direction, can only be
construed as equivalent to a direction
that increases in the size of business
organisations must be restricted. It is
idle to suggest that officials, assisted by
laymen (all necessarily limited as to
business experience), would interpret the
provisions in any other way.
Neither employees nor other con-
sumers will find their aspiration for
higher living standards realised if the
proposed legislation is put into opera-
tion. Investors, now widely spread
among the lower-income groups, have
every reason to fear the effects of the
proposed scheme.
“Feather-bedding” for the inefficient
business (large or small) can be seen as
the motive for many of the proposals
not a desire to strengthen the sources
of national progress.
The Attorney-General holds himself
out as the new champion of small
businesses. This offers no encourage-
ment to those which are trying to be-
come large businesses some day, or
expect to be paid handsomely for being
taken over. Other small businesses
should be warned that one local
economist considers that “even firms
with relatively small shares of the
market may be guilty of monopolising”,
strange though this may seem.
In the kaleidoscopic groupings that
active competition brings about, small
businesses are far more dependent than
large-scale enterprises on arrangements
for orderly marketing and steadying
prices. It is one of their ways of meet-
ing the competition of large concerns
on more even terms.
Overseas experience shows that the
small businessman attracts most atten-
tion from a restrictive trade bureau-
cracy and, lacking resources to fight
his case, becomes its chief victim.
Sir Garfield seeks to outdo experi-
ments by other Western nations with
this kind of legislation, and he draws
the enthusiastic support of the economist
I have just quoted because “what has
been deemed proper and desirable in
these countries can hardly be wrong for
Australia!”
How odd that this should be put for-
ward as “the most cogent argument for
an effective anti-monopoly measure in
Australia”? Surely there are local
differences, and surely Australians can
come to a different conclusion if they
are correctly informed as to what is
necessary to enable the country to move
rapidly towards industrial maturity.
It may assist their assessment, how-
ever, to know what is actually going on
in other countries as the result of similar
legislation. Therefore, the next article
will give this some consideration.
[A fourth article in this series will
appear next week.]

of plastics from the UK in

ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
The High Taxation Party
Milking Companies Up To The Hilt
F. CREAN, M.P.
Labor’s Shadow
Treasurer
Tf Mr Frank Crean, presumably Labor’s
shadow Treasurer, had been in Mr
Holt’s shoes on Budget night, it is un-
mistakably clear from the economic
policy document he successfully fathered
at the Perth ALP conference what his
general taxation proposals would have
been. And in case anybody was still in
doubt that the Labor Party wishes in
future to be known as the high taxation
party, there was Mr Calwell’s own testi-
mony on TV after the Perth conference.
To be more precise, the ALP has now
put it down in black and white that,
while it would reduce taxation in the
lower ranges of incomes, it would com-
pensate for any loss of revenue from
doing this by introducing a more pro-
gressive scale of Income Tax rates and
by increasing Company Tax. Nor is
this only a long-term policy. It would
be the prescription for the present as
well as the future.
With so much spending to be done
by the Government on defence, unem-
ployment, housing and education (though
not for private schools!) Mr Calwell
believes that any reduction in overall
taxation revenue is out of the question
and, of course, he would have no hesi-
tation in running big budget deficits to
cover any shortfall in the Government’s
overall cash requirements. That is pre-
cisely what he said in his television
interview.
/"\ne is interested, economicswise, not
so much in the social and political
implications of his high taxation policy,
as in whether it is a sound one for an
economy whose mainspring is private
enterprise. (Judging by a mumbled
obiter dicta in Mr Calwell’s TV talk,
you couldn’t be too sure that, though
its new policy statement says as much,
the ALP has, in fact, given nationalisa-
tion away as an objective in favor of
a series of Government-owned enter-
prises running parallel to and in com-
petition with private enterprise.)
Going on the appendix on taxation in
the Crean committee’s report, in current
circumstances a Labor Treasurer would
have cut indirect taxes and income tax
on low incomes. This would be econo-
mically sound as probably the best way
to promote the higher personal spend-
ing required to bring more resources
(including labor) into employment,
though it cannot be considered in iso-
lation to other tax moves a Labor
Treasurer would have made if following
the lines of the report, to wit, increasing
taxation on companies and higher in-
come ranges.
A lthough Labor says it would abolish
payroll tax —this declaration should
be noted indelibly for future reference
• it seems to have in mind the small
businesses rather than the solid mass
of bigger companies, because it intends
to collect very much more overall. This
implies that it would have increased
company tax in the current year and
would in future have no inhibitions in
milking companies up to the hilt.
The curious thing is that while Mr
Crean’s committee wants company taxa-
tion to be increased, it is very dis-
turbed about the failure of private en-
terprise to whip up investment. For in-
stance, it admits that private fixed in-
vestment is at present sluggish, and that
this “can have unfortunate repercussions
on future employment,” and that “these
are matters which the Labor Party and
the trade unions should view with con-
cern because they point to structural
problems in the economy which should
be analysed sooner than later.”
One reading might be that Labor is
more despairing than the Government
about restoring private investment to
the appropriate level for full employ-
ment, and can thus afford to throw back
the veil on its true image as a redistri-
butor of incomes party. But such an in-
terpretation would still neglect the fact
that the Crean document is fully aware
of the need to stimulate private invest-
ment, at least at the present time.
The question is how to reconcile con-
cern over repercussions of slow private
fixed investment on employment and
certain intractable structural problems
in the economy with the Labor policy
of increasing imposts on companies.
This is something on which the ALP
will have to say a lot more than it has
thus far, unless it wants to be an Aunt
Sally for every economist in the country
when the next election comes around.
Is it, perhaps, that the ALP thinks
the adverse effects of an increase in
company taxation on private investment
would be negatived by the policy of
stimulating spending power? Is the argu-
ment that a new spending stimulus,
which a Crean budget would doubtless
put as a No. 1 priority, would clear
the block of unused capacity in industry
and so open the way to higher invest-
ment in new plant and machinery? There
are certainly grounds for thinking that,
given a sufficiently strong spending
stimulus, a useful reduction could be
made in unused capacity by this method,
and also that, despite higher company
tax, before-tax profits might become
buoyant enough to offset any increase
in tax rates.
TJowever, this sort of argument
neglects the important fact that one
of the greatest needs in this Budget was
for something which would give a
decisive lift to business confidence. This
would hardly have been achieved by an
increase in company tax. On the con-
trary, this would have given a further
blow to business confidence and been a
dampener to private investment.
The favorable impression created by
the abolition of payroll tax (if, in fact,
that were done) would have been wholly
offset by the sharp increase in com-
pany tax rates needed to bring in more
tax revenue from companies.
As for increasing taxation rates on
higher incomes, this would also have
the effect of depressing business con-
fidence, because business men would be
among those most affected by it. In-
deed, the more the Crean taxation dic-
tum is examined the more determined
the ALP appears to be to curb the ex-
pansionist hormones of private enter-
prise and to seek economic salvation
through spending rather than private
investment, despite the lip service paid
to the latter in the conference-approved
economic policy statement.

A Bull on the Rampage?
'Mow that the Budget has come and
gone, brokers will soon learn
whether the investing public agrees with
their many pre-Budget prognostications
that share prices were too low, even at
within touching point of the “high”
reached in the 1960 boom. A good
guide to this is the volume of profit-
taking by investors after the Budget
from those who decided they had
obtained a sufficient rise out of the
market for the time being. The attitude
of the institutions, so far showing no
hurry to enter the market, also will be
an important influence.
In a lot of cases brokers have been
indulging in, perhaps, too much wish-
ful thinking about the prospects for a
further strong advance after the Bud-
get, taking it as read that this time Mr
Holt could take the bull by the
horns and ride into the highlands. How-
ever, one Melbourne broker has put up
a very interesting case in justification of
such an advance by saying he thinks it
ought to occur rather than it will.
Posing the question whether the share
market is under-valued, he believes that
“it could be” and thinks that prominent
among the reasons “is the startling fact
that twice in the last two months over-
seas companies have shown their pre-
paredness to pay substantially more than
current market prices for Australian
companies.”
The two cases, of course, are Uni-
lever’s 455. a share bid for Rosella
against the pre-bid market price of 30s.
for the shares, and Plessey’s more re-
cent bid of 335. for Ducor. Industries’
shares, more than double the pre-leak
market price of 16s. 3d.
The broker says that these are de-
velopments “which point clearly and
conclusively to the fact that interna-
tional financial circles, whose experience
in these matters is considerable, regard
our present level of share prices as
very much lower than it should be,
having regard to the potential they
offer.” Certainly one could counter the
claim that our shares are under-priced
by stating that in the above instances
the seemingly generous bids were speci-
fically made to obtain either an import-
ant foothold or a major share in an
established Australian market.
On the other hand, many other com-
panies here have similar attractions to
offer. Overseas companies are prepared
to discount future benefits, whereas we
are hesitant to do so, the broker says. As
a hypothetical example of present under-
valuation, he suggests that “if a foreign
company had offered 40s. for BHP’s
shares in 1959, it would have compared
favorably with the then ruling price of
295. 9d. (adjusted for the subsequent
cash and bonus issues). Yet when com-
pared with today’s price of 555., the fic-
titious offer looks very ordinary.”
The point is that it only requires a
greater number of people in this coun-
try to share the implicit faith that many
overseas industrialists have in the growth
of Australia to enable our share mar-
kets to more truly reflect their inherent
worth. Unfortunately, we seemingly have
developed an interest rate structure that
requires an immediate income return
from investments at the expense of maxi-
mum development and growth.
This broker believes that if we do not
readjust our evaluations quickly enough
the ownership of more Australian enter-
prises will be lost to the investing com-
munity. A sobering thought, with the
gate of entry still wide open.
Looking at the immediate prospect,
the broker thinks that if the market fails
to break through present levels, profit
taking by short-term investors will be-
come more evident. However, a strong
upward thrust could develop as sellers
withdraw especially if the Budget
gives the green light to industry and
the economy generally, the broker con-
cludes.
Australian Appointed to
Exclusive “Club”
11/fR G. G. Lippman, of The National
Mutual Life Association, Sydney,
has been admitted to membership of
“The Million Dollar Round Table,” an
organisation comprising the world’s top
echelon of life assurance agents. He is
the first Australian to be so honored.
The “Round Table” was founded in
Chicago in 1927, and amongst the
requirements for membership is selling
at least one million dollars (American)
of new life assurance every year.
Although its name may suggest a
council of millionaire medieval knights,
the main function of the organisation is
encouragement of high ethical standards
of life assurance selling.


INVESTMENT SECTION
Anthony Hordern Battles On
Chairman Could Have Been More Explicit
A nthony Hordern shareholders must
take what solace they can from the
“interim report” put out by the chair-
man (Mr R. A. Irish) last week. The
20s. ordinaries seem destined to hang
their few shillings below par for some
time yet.
Those who are distant from the
sources, of city gossip, and who have
been puzzled by recent market oscilla-
tions, might genuinely have appreciated
a more explicit reference to the “certain
incorrect rumors” Mr Irish attempts to
nail.
Takeover and receivership are not
such dirty words as all that. Under the
circumstances shareholders can surely be
trusted with plain statement.
Everybody the least interested real-
ises the brave struggle the board and
management embarked on about 1961,
when so many problems hit the com-
pany together. Last year’s tremendous
loss did not allow directors even the
luxury of feeling that “the general con-
cept is sound,” a belief they once ex-
pressed.
So a break-even for the financial year
ending August, if it eventuates, will be
something of a triumph. “The results
now being shown in all sections leave no
doubt that the group is on a profitable
basis, which is expected to improve,”
Mr Irish clearly says, thereby suggesting
distant prospects.
To reach that situation considerable
pruning of “the general concept” proves
necessary. Brickfield Hill’s optimisti-
cally conceived food annexe was leased
to Woolworths, which also bought the
Canberra store, running at a loss since
December, 1962. Other “uneconomic”
surplus assets are still to go.
The main Brickfield Hill store remains
the core problem. Here the tide may
have turned “The store should not
show a loss in future and if the rising
tendency continues, it will at last be
profitable.”
Despite this store’s position in the
“bad” part of Sydney, both directors
and shareholders may receive a little
comfort from the Commonwealth Statis-
tician’s latest census of retail establish-
ments. Since 1956-57 true department
stores have increased in number and
lifted sales. Shoppers still want them!
Lend Lease Foundations
T end Lease Corporation has lost a
fair amount of market sheen dur-
ing the past few months. Investors,
though, should not drop their interest
for what remains a highly efficient and
solid building group. The efficiency ex-
tends through both technical and
financial operations.
Use of the word “solid”, perhaps,
indicates that some of the earlier develop-
mental glamor is rubbing off. Such a
process might well be accepted as the
hectic flush of the boom fading away.
There’s still enough prospect in basic
office building and home construction,
with occasional large-scale centre work
thrown in.
Some investment hesitation must
naturally have eventuated from the bare
bones of 1962-63's preliminary report.
Directors left too much unsaid and have
quite a lot of explanation to do in full
accounts and at September’s annual
meeting.
After an admitted £43,169 drop in
earnings for the first half of the year,
compared with the previous correspond-
ing period, the whole year finished up
only £15,999 below 1961-62’s peak profit
of £580,693.
But the latest profit at £564,694 brings
earning rate back from 21.5 to 16.7 p.c.,
its first time below 20 p.c. since 1959.
More capital was, of course, used follow-
ing last August's one-for-four premium
issue.
Whether an actual trading improve-
ment took place in the second half must
still be settled. In April the group received
an additional £1.4 million payment on
the Opera House contract and a size-
able profit from this could have been
taken in before June 30.
Directors must also clarify the seem-
ing puzzle of tax and depreciation pro-
visions tax down £88,964 to
£339,554, depreciation up £101,985 to
£218,863. There are certainly tax losses
available among subsidiaries, while ruth-
less depreciation and amortisation pro-
grammes are a Lend Lease byword.
Again, shareholders will wish to hear
how problems of the first half-year were
overcome. These included establishment
losses in brick and lightweight aggregate
plants; lower profits from non-recurring
expenses in two industrial subsidiaries;
and, the developer’s bugbear, holding
costs on sites.
Immediately following the prelimin-
ary statement, the ss. shares dropped 3d.
to stand at 12s. lid., there yielding 3.9
p.c. on the 10 p.c. dividend held since
1960. They have only been as high as
14s. lOd. during 1963, well below 1962’s
top 235. 2d.
Even while waiting on a fuller report
the shares should not be ignored at pre-
sent prices. Levels will not rise much be-
fore September, but it is worth remem-
bering how much there is in the build-
ing game over the years ahead. Lend
Lease assuredly possesses the necessary
organisational advantages to take a
prominent part.
A Nourishing Pye
J>ye Industries has achieved quite a
startling result in a year not noted
for unduly favoring electrical appliance
makers. Directors had remarked upon
an upturn after closing their 1961-62
accounts. That year’s extensive capital
expenditure also must have had some-
thing to do with such a vastly improved
position.
Profit to March 31 skyrocketed
£158,543 to £322,271, after two suc-
cessive falls. Earning rate climbs drama-
tically from 21.1 to 43 p.c., its best level
since 1957-58's record £423,844 repre-
sented a rate of 57 p.c.
Once more the £328,449 tax pro-
vision, lifted by £158,539, is ahead of
the profit.
The group spreads very widely over
the appliance and general electrical field,
which doubtless helps in years of
erratic consumer demand. Marketing also
appears characteristically efficient.
England's Pye Ltd owns 51 p.c. of
ordinary capital. The local shares are
mostly very well sought. Prices just
before the profit announcement had
reached a 1963 high at 51s. 3d. to
yield 3.8 p.c. on the 10 p.c. dividend.
After the profit, quotes broadened
immediately. Two days’ keen buying
brought prices to 70s.
Taxes Hit The Australia
Statutory charges rates and land
tax largely offset the gain in
turnover for The Australia Hotel Co.
Ltd in the year to June 30, 1963. Al-
though profit recovered a little, it was
still about half that for 1959-60.
The earning rate of 8.3 p.c. (last
year 6.7 p.c.) necessitated the third con-
secutive cut in dividend, this time from
10 to 8 p.c.
Metropole’s Fat Dividend
Shareholders of The Hotel Metro-
pole Ltd will receive the fattest
dividend in the 42 years of its public
history, with the distribution of a final
9 p.c. making 14 p.c. for the year to
June 30.
Earning rate goes up from 14.7 to
15.9 p.c., which is not a large margin
on the new dividend rate, so directors
must be confident that next year’s will
be better.

Specialty Spreads Itself
A One-for-four bonus and share split
from 10s. to ss. units should spread
Specialty Press shares around, and make
for more active trading.
A 36 p.c. lift in profit to £114,520
(equal to 44.4 p.c. on capital) was the
performance in the latest year to June 30.
Noteholders happily participate in the
bonus, too.
The company could easily maintain
the traditional 12J p.c. dividend on bonus
inflated capital.
Astor Redeems Capital
Qale of its thread-making subsidiary
to English interests has provided over
£200,000 surplus funds which Astor
Consolidated Mills Ltd proposes to repay
to shareholders.
A return of 3s. a ss. share will reduce
paid capital by £174,045 to £116,030.
Unsecured notes of £77,850 will also be
redeemed.
The ss. shares were at the time quoted
at around 7s. Id. Whether they are
worth 4s. Id. after the capital repayment
depends on the profit-earning capacity of
the remainder of the business.
Shareholders will look for some
guidance on this in September-October
when 1962-63 accounts are presented.
No Need For Pessimism
VUhile the conservative accounting
" practices of Australian Portland
Cement Ltd prevent the observer from
accepting the published figures without
some qualification, it can be said that
1962-63 was not as profitable as its
predecessor.
The market has made heavy allow-
ance for the new competition in Victoria
from the Blue Circle group, in assessing
the worth of the shares of the two
holding companies, Australian Cement
Ltd and Kandos Cement Ltd.
But there were some special reasons
why the latest year to May 31 was a
difficult one for APC. The prolonged
spell of exceptionally wet weather in
NSW affected sales. Any builder will
confirm this.
Operation of new and additional plant
at both Kandos and Geelong was de-
layed, but plant operation at Kandos is
now improving and the new Geelong
kiln, to be the largest in Australia, is
designed to show cost savings.
Shareholders of Australian Cement
and Kandos should not be too pessimis-
tic about the future of these two tried-
and-true blue chips.
Olims’ 13th Takeover
/Alims Consolidated Ltd continues its
progressive path, this time by take-
over of three Sydney companies which
will provide central showrooms and dis-
play and warehouse premises.
They were J. A. Mackay Pty of
William Street, Edels Pty of King Street
and Edels Credits Pty of Sussex Street.
This brings the list of takeovers to
13 since Olims’ formation in March,
1962. A handy share premium reserve
has thereby been created.
The latest takeovers were for a con-
sideration of 82,000 ss. ordinary shares
at 13s. premium, and 10,000 ss. de-
ferred shares at 12s. premium.
Q’land SEC’s 31st Loan
Queensland State Electricity
Commission is on the market again
with its 31st loan—one of £4,575,000
bearing interest of 5 p.c. for maturities
of 10, 20 and 35 years, and of
£4 17s. 6d. p.c. for a shorter maturity
of seven years at the option of the sub-
scriber. It also offers conversion of hold-
ings in loans 6, 9 and 19 (matured on
August 1) and loan 26 maturing on
October 1.
The Commission enters its new
financial year with the largest works
programme it has ever undertaken. This
reflects the enormous growth of the
State, emphasising the rapidly increas-
ing need for electricity services for
new and expanding industries.

It’s surprising how many “V.X.P.” chairs are getting into clubs, lounges
and waiting rooms of various kinds.
Surprising even to us. When we produced the “V.1.P.” range of easy chairs, we went
out of our way to make them extra comfortable and extra strong.
Naturally, they cost a little more* than run-of-the-mill domestic chairs, which are
usually made down to a price, and we weren’t sure whether there would be enough
discerning buyers who would appreciate that the cheapest isn’t necessarily the best.
Fortunately, there were. More and more organisations are becoming aware of the
desirability of providing really comfortable easy chairs as an amenity. They have
also realised that they couldn’t afford to replace or repair such furniture too often, and,
therefore, have to buy easy chairs especially designed
for such a purpose. That’s why they’re buying “V.l.P.’s.”
Ii you're thinking of buying a quantity of chairs
or tables for a hall, club, hotel, etc., perhaps
you'd better ask us for a copy of our quantity
price list.

Confirmation From Experts
performance of Reinvestment
(Australia) Ltd must give heart to
those individuals who have had their
own investment setbacks.
The company’s profit of £20,800 for
the year to June 30 represents a lowly
3.65 p.c. on capital. A loss on share
trading was incurred, of something more
than £7,500, but the exact amount has
not yet been revealed.
Directors’ plan of action in 1961-62,
described to shareholders at the last
annual meeting, was to build liquidity to
allow investment at the appropriate time
in equities showing strong earnings
yields and reserves, whose management
was attacking costs and productivity; to
reinvest income mainly in rights to
shares considered a “must”; and to avoid
v the temptation to buy growth.
The object of the company is to build
up a portfolio by reinvestment of income
each year, with no dividends for the first
fifteen years. Existing tax laws permit
companies to accumulate greater funds
than an individual would by investment
in identical securities, because dividends
in company hands are virtually not
subject to Federal income tax.
Because the company had an unfor-
tunate birth in boom days, it does not
necessarily make the shares unattrac-
tive, if the portfolio can be well managed.
The present market of around 14s. 6d.
for the 20s. shares (which are now
backed by net tangible assets at market
value of 19s. lid.) allows purchase at
a very considerable discount.

NKS Should Benefit From
Building Spurt
Keeping firmly near their 1963 peak
at 325., the 20s. shares of NKS
(Holdings) are still worth getting.
The company principally makes and
distributes a healthily diverse range of
building materials. Its operations must
certainly show some, benefit from an
improved 1962-63 economic climate and
gain faster impetus with the now
observable life in building activity.
Confirmation of better conditions
over the whole industry has lately been
provided by the ANZ Bank’s July
examination of business indicators. In-
creased housing approvals especially
will broaden the effect.
On the present livelier sharemarkets
investors have not heeded the future
alone in circumspectly advancing NKS
prices. It is one of those reliable
second-line stocks properly to be sought
at this stage of the market’s progress.
Indeed, esteem has remained measur-
ably constant despite 1962-63’s profit
slip, in the full awareness that the com-
pany is completely able to respond to
less difficult trading. Prices have not
gone beiow 295. 6d. during 1963 and
the high now is only Is. 6d. under last
year’s top.
Present levels yield 5 p.c., rather
advantageous from this particular sec-
tion, on the 8 p.c. dividend which has
been paid since 1958. Radical excite-
ments are not, of course, expected and
all directors did in February was to say
that “the upward trend in demand for
products manufactured and distributed
has been maintained in the half-year to
December 31, 1962.” Both turnover
and profits of member companies went
ahead.
Earnings for 1961-62 went down by
£63,372 to £297,002, their first retreat
in seven years. They represented an
earning rate on ordinary capital of
£2,505,927 at 11.9 p.c., in contrast
with the previous year’s best achieved
rate of 14.4 p.c.
Though trading was particularly in-
fluenced by reduced demand for capital
equipment and copper and brass tubing, .
all prominent lines, directors had no
difficulty at all in preserving a very
sound accounting position.
There are no long-term liabilities. As
at June 30, 1962, overdraft had gone
up moderately from £32,227 to £45,696.
On the other hand £46,570 cash still
stood at bank and on hand while
£lOO,OOO was out on deposit.
Trade creditors at £1,285,613 could
be set against debtors totalling
£1,299,779. Stocks had been brought
down from £1,492,494 to £1,294,492.
The group’s liquidity during the
squeeze had been greatly stimulated by
the sale, in 1959-60, of its 750,000
shares in the Noyes (Aust.) Pty mer-
chandising subsidiary for £656,250 cash.
General reserves last year took £125,000
from profits and total reserves then
reached £913,972. They were subject
to a rather high £548,555 of intangibles,
leaving net tangible assets backing of
the 20s. shares at 225. lid.
When the 1962-63 accounts become
available in October, the manufacturing
side should be seen to have gained from
the aluminium extrusion press in full
production since last year. The zinc,
aluminium and bronze die-casting sub-
sidiary could also have picked up on
reduced demand. The company is not
neglecting export opportunities.
Such agency lines as the Broom and
Wade (England) air compressors, pneu-
matic tools and machine tools fit in
equally with building hardware to the
better Australian economy. NKS pre-
sents a bright long-term front.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
GUD Holdings Underpriced
Lucky Switch Into Auto Parts
TThe ordinary shares of GUD Hold-
A ings Ltd were first listed just over
four years ago. During this time share-
holders have received, first, a one-for-
four bonus issue and a one-for-four par
issue; secondly, an increase in the divi-
dend rate equivalent to another one-for-
four bonus issue; and, finally, in March
cf this year, another one-for-four bonus
issue. Yet, at the time of writing, the
shares show a 4.6 p.c. immediate divi-
dend yield from the current price of
275.
At this level the shares are selling at
about 16.4 times earnings, but as per
share earnings have nearly doubled over
the last four years, this would seem to
be a rather low ratio, especially when
we are looking at the earnings of 1961-
62 which could hardly be described as
a boom year. Other companies which
are much belter known as manu-
facturers of automotive components,
such as National Consolidated and
Repco, sell today at about 20 times
earnings and have not shown anywhere
near the same growth in the last four
years that GUD has shown. If GUD’s
shares were to sell at 20 times earnings,
the price today would be 335.
Although GUD Holdings Ltd was
formed only in April, 1958, the original
business under the name of the present
operating company, GUD Manufac-
turing Company Pty Ltd, was founded in
December, 1940. The objective was to
manufacture certain chemical products,
but the company soon began the pro-
duction of oil filters to satisfy in part the
great demand from the Armed Services.
Tn 1953, the factory was moved to the
present site of 23 acres at Maribyr-
nong (Vic.). This site was owned by Wal-
dac Publications Pty Ltd, and GUD
Holdings Ltd acquired the issued capital
of this company at the same time as pub-
lic listing was applied for. Then, paid
capital was only £lOO,OOO.
Goss Gasket Manufacturing Co. Pty
Ltd was acquired in October, 1959, and
the plant, equipment and stock of Rees
and Johnston in July, 1960. The only
other acquisition was announced in
February this year, when the can and
core manufacturing division of RMD
Press Co. Pty Ltd was acquired. Thus,
of the issued capital, only 25 p.c. ap
proximately (taking into account sub-
sequent bonus issues) has been issued
since listing to other than the original
shareholders. While it is too early to
judge whether the latest acquisition will
be profitable, it is fairly clear that those
of 1960 have certainly helped to raise
profitability.
So far as the future is concerned, it
would seem that the company must be
dependent to a large extent on the ex-
pansion of the number of vehicles re-
gistered. In the 1960-61 annual report,
the directors stated that “. . . only a
small proportion of the company’s pro-
duction is for original equipment and
we are therefore not greatly affected by
the restriction of production of new
vehicles.” The following table shows the
company’s per share earnings, new
vehicle registrations and the number of
vehicles on the register expressed as a
series with 1958-59 as the base year:—
1959 1960 1961 1962
GUD per share
earnings 100 112 115 127
New registrations 100 121 116 111
No. on register 100 107 114 119
These figures provide confirmation of
the directors’ statement.
Tf the expected increase of about 7
p.c. has occurred in the year ended
June 30, 1963, it would not be unreason-
able to expect that the earnings of GUD
would be about £.89,000 this year,
before taking into account any profit
from the business acquired from RMD
Press Pty Ltd. There can be little doubt
that earnings will show a substantial in-
crease for 1962-63 over 1961-62, other-
wise the company would hardly have
made the bonus issue last March. In
fact, this issue suggests that earnings
could pass the £93,000 mark if the
dividend of 25 p.c. on new capital is to
be covered H times as it always has
been in the past.
Whatever may happen regarding the
earnings, there seems little doubt that
the 25 p.c. dividend rate will be main-
tained this year after the one-for-four
bonus issue made in March, and this
would mean that dividend income will
have increased by over 125 p.c. in four
years, or at the average annual com-
pound rate of 223 p.c. per annum. And
earnings appear to have kept pace with
this dramatic increase.
It is likely that the number of vehicles
on the register will not increase at the
same rate over the next seven years as
they have over the last seven. Neverthe-
less, an annual compound rate of in-
crease of 5 p.c. is considered likely. On
past performance we can expect GUD’s
earnings to increase at least at the same
rate, and the company’s history suggests
that dividend payout will increase in
line with earnings.
If only a 5 p.c. annual compound
rate of increase in dividend income is
expected over the next ten years, in-
vestors seeking a 7 p.c. yield could pay
up to 35s. for the shares. This is only
slightly above the 33s. mentioned
earlier if GUD was to sell on the same
price/earnings ratio as National Con-
solidated and Repco.
However, over the period since list-
ing, the shares have never sold above
31s. This was during the boom year of
1960. As a matter of interest, if GUD
only maintains its high growth rate for
the next five years and then falls away
to a 3 p.c. annual increase, the effective
yield from the present price would be
11 p.c. per annum.
There seems little doubt that the
shares are underpriced at 27s. and
would be good value up to at least 33s.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Listing for Big NZ Firm?
United Empire Box Company's Expansion
TTnited Empire Box Co. Ltd, Auck-
land, by far New Zealand’s largest
packaging group, may apply for listing
on the Australian Stock Exchanges in
the not too distant future. A hint of this
is given in the notice for the extra-
ordinary meeting on August 22, which
will be asked to approve amendments
in the Articles aimed at conformation
to the Australian Associated Stock
Exchanges’ listing requirements.
Moreover, directors are asking the
meeting to put at their disposal 600,000
ss. shares, to be issued at their dis-
cretion. As there seems no reason for
a further placement in New Zealand
apart from takeovers it would not be
surprising if at least part of these shares
ended up with Australian investors.
The company has used share place-
ments in the past to improve its liquidity
but to lift working capital from the
present low figure of £315,000 it has
already announced a £360,000 convert-
ible note issue (its second in 13 months),
while it is also arranging a reduction of
its £1 million equity in land and
buildings.
After a takeover war with Australian
Consolidated Industries, which resulted
in very few independent cardboard box
makers being left in New Zealand, UE
Box now seems set for a period of con-
solidation.
The company has factories all over
the country and makes boxes, set-up
boxes and display material, bags, decora-
tions, paper masks and clothes and a
wide range of plastic products, including
kitchenware, hairpins and rainwear. An
expansion in the latter field seems likely,
but on the whole capital expenditure is
now tapering off.
UE Box makes its own corrugated
paper, and, after a threat to start up a
board mill earlier this year, now has an
agreement with NZ Forest Products,
under which it will continue to draw its
raw materials from Forest Products in
return for an undertaking by the latter
not to enter the box-making field.
In Australia, the company has two
subsidiaries, of which the main one is
Chiswick Containers Pty Ltd, 80 p.c.
owned by UE Box and 20 p.c. by the
Co-operative Box Co. of NSW Ltd. This
company, which operates a container
factory at Drummoyne, is still running at
a loss, but this was reduced from
£NZ21,017 to £13,188 this year.
A valuable asset is the 58.3 p.c. hold-
ing in Ashley Wallpapers Ltd. This
company’s Wellington plant is one of
two making wallpapers in New Zealand.
Started in 1960, it became profitable in
the year just past and should contribute
increasingly to group results. It has
already been necessary to expand the
factory.
The company has been thoroughly re-
organised in recent years. Plant was
switched from one factory to another,
activities of certain kinds were centralised
and headquarters shifted from Wellington
to Auckland. The result of much dis-
ruption is evident from the 1960 and
1961 profits, but the company is now be-
ginning to reap the benefit. In the year
to March 31 sales soared from £5.3 mil-
lion to £7.2 million. Net profit rose
32.5 p.c. and earning rate is now most
satisfactory.
There are several indications that
turnover will show a further rise in the
current year, which started on a high
level. For example, the company’s con-
tract as sole supplier of butter boxes to
the NZ Dairy Board was increased.
Depreciation reached a record
£205,000 in the latest year, but should
soon begin to come back to a lower
level.
Higher sales, lower depreciation, in-
creased efficiency and a reduction of
capital expenditure should combine
this year to produce a further increase in
earnings, which could be substantial.
Australian investors wanting to get
in might be wise to wait until the shares
become ex-rights to the one-for-five issue
of 5s. notes at par at the end of August.
When the previous note issue was made
in August, 1962, the shares were quickly
back at their old level. They are now
around 12s. 9d. The 1962 notes opened
at 8s. 3d. and are at present selling
slightly above 10s.

WILLIAM ADAMS & CO. LTD
Spectacular Recovery
Ohareholders of William Adams and
Co. Ltd must be more than satis-
fied by the recovery of the company in
the last financial year. Following a 12
p.c. increase in sales, profit rose by 136
p.c. and dividend is well on the way to
being restored to the 15 p.c. paid in the
11 years to 1961.
The company began operations in
1884 and now operates in all States.
For many years it was known prin-
cipally as a steel merchant, but in recent
years these activities have been greatly
extended. Steel merchandising is now
only one of four major interests. The
group’s merchandising division offers a
wide range of portable electric tools,
abrasives, valves and pipe fittings and
hand tools.
The group also has a large engineer-
ing section as well as holding franchises
for Caterpillar tractors and Hyster In-
ternational trucks in Victoria and Tas-
mania. It also holds a licensing agree-
ment for Ferrodor paint and recently
began a steel reinforcing offshoot,
although neither of these is a major con-
cern.
The growth of capital was gradual,
with shareholders’ participating fully in
the benefits. Between 1938 and 1950,
shareholders were offered four share
issues, three at par, and after the capital
reorganisation in 1950, when the 14s.
shares were converted into 20s. units
on a seven-for-10 basis, they participated
in a one-for-five bonus, a two-for-five
par issue in 1956, a one-for-two con-


vertible note issue in 1959 and a one-
for-five cash issue in 1961.
Profits have moved gradually higher
every year since 1935, although the
move has not always been continuous.
Biggest turn-round in earnings was in
the 1961-62 year when the profit fell
from a record £316,074 to £102,143
the lowest point for more than 12 years.
Following the increase in capital dur-
ing the year, earning rate slumped from
26.4 p.c. to just on 7 p.c., and earnings
failed to cover the dividend payout by
£44,857.
But last year, following a rise in sales
from £11.7 million to £13.1 million,
profit more than doubled to £281,753
equal to 18 p.c. on capital, and dividend
was raised to lli p.c. As the final pay-
out was 6i p.c., this obviously indicated
the intention of establishing a 12i p.c.
rate for the current year, although re-
turn to the 15 p.c. dividend rate paid for
so long may not be long delayed.
However, the company may decide to
restrict the payout of 12i p.c. because
of the 600,000 20s. notes due for con-
version to ordinary shares on a one-for-
one basis in April, 1965, although re-
serves could well support a higher divi-
dend distribution.
Accounts for the year to April 30 last
show the group to be in a very healthy
position. Stocks are down from
£3,644,476 to £3,486,082 while debt-
ors are up from £1,595,922 to
£2,062,155 after providing £54,000
for doubtful debts. Freehold property,
in the books at £1,196,031, was last re-
valued in 1958.
During the year, bank overdraft was
more than halved from £396,678 to
£167,424 while trade creditors rose
from £583,275 to £904,810.
The reserves position is particularly
strong with paid up capital of
£1,560,000 exceeded by the general re-
serve of £1,641,000. Capital reserves,
the largest of which is assets revaluation
of £200,000, total £242,758. Total re-
serves and surplus profit give the 20s.
shares a net assets backing of 465. 4d.

ROBERT BRYCE AND CO. LTD
Marked Pick-Up After Squeeze
T>obert Bryce and Co. Ltd., as a sup-
* plier of raw materials to secondary
industry, suffered severely as expected
during the credit squeeze, but, following
the pick-up in business confidence, has
shown during the 1962-63 financial year
a marked improvement.
The company supplies heavy chemi-
cals, electrodes, welding equipment,
laundry and dry-cleaning equipment,
refractories and foundry supplies, plas-
tics, tanning supplies, raw cotton, filter
materials and requirements of the paint,
textile, rubber and brush industries.
The group now operates in most of
the eastern States as well as New Zea-
land, although it has only one subsidiary,
T.H.D. Pty Ltd, which it acquired for the
sake of its freehold.
The company was formed in Mel-
bourne in 1913 to take over an import-
ing business which had been in opera-
tion for the previous seven years. It
floated in 1951 with an issue of 200,000
ss. shares at 7s. 6d., lifting paid-up
capital to £302,531.
The growth in issued capital has been
small, with a one-for-three bonus in
1958 and a private placement of 150,000
shares at a premium of 7s. in 1960.
Early in 1961 the company issued
£95,000 8i p.c. five-year notes and
£25,000 8i p.c. ten-year notes. Paid-up
capital at last balance date was
£440,874, all in ss. ordinary shares.
In the 1960 year profit was a record
£98,835, equal to 25.4 p.c. on capital,
but, as business slowed up, it fell —to
£80,612 (equal to 18.8 p.c.) in 1961
and then, when the full effects of the
squeeze were felt, to £17,075 in 1962,
equal to 3.9 p.c. on capital.
As the profit dropped, the dividend
rate was reduced from 17i p.c. to
15 p.c. and then to 10 p.c., although
earnings failed to cover this last pay-
ment by a considerable margin.
But in the 1963 year, which finished
on March 31, profit showed a strong
recovery, more than trebling to £72,183,
equal to 16.4 p.c. on capital, and divi-
dend was raised to 12i p.c.
Outlook for the current year is good
with sales at a satisfactory level and
likely to stay that way.
In Sydney, the Kent Street property
will be sold and all activities concen-
trated under one roof at a new property
at Waterloo.
The latest accounts show the com-
pany may soon need the use of ad-
ditional funds, for liquidity is down.
Stocks are up sharply from £680,181 to
a record £836,387, while bank over-
draft has jumped from £38,266 to
£282,610. Debtors are down from
£767,072 to £750,612, while creditors
are down from £811,261 to £742,782.
The shares are currently selling
around 10s. 3d. to show a dividend
yield of 6.1 p.c. and an earnings yield
of 8 p.c. At this price they appear a
sound investment.

Company Profits Go Crazy
/Company profits have gone crazy.
Anything less than a 20 p.c. in-
crease is just not worth mentioning.
In the last week in my book,
Courtaulds and A. V. Jennings came
to the fore. The 200 p.c. jump by
Courtaulds had been more than antici-
pated in some quarters, judging by the
strength in the market in the previous
week. At 21s. it was a good opportunity
to reduce my largest holding to one-half
and also take a profit of £lO5.
A. V. Jennings, with a 44 p.c. in-
crease, was not quite as spectacular.
Nevertheless, it got the share up to 12s.
Sensing another building share boom, it
not only stays in the portfolio but is
joined by my old friend Hunter
Douglas.
One cannot accuse that company’s
share of lacking life. It has been as high
as 465. and as low as 31s. 6d. in the
last year. The company was very popular
after it came in with a 16 p.c. earning
rate last year. Those keen young
analysts decided then that this share had
all the symptoms for growth a re-
organised company under dynamic
management with an expanding range
of products. But, alas, the interim re-
port upset the apple cart when it an-
nounced that profit and sales were below
expectations.
Profit will probably be lower for the
full year just finished, but the company
should have no difficulty maintaining
the 10 p.c. dividend. At 335. the yield
of 6 p.c. is well above average for
companies of this calibre.
If the building industry is going to
boom, then Hunter Douglas will be out
in front. Another point as far as a
quick rise is concerned is the scarcity
of the shares 75 p.c. of the capital is
held by the international Hunter Doug-
las group. A purchase of 200 at 335.
was made on Thursday.
All Hunter Douglas has to do is to
go up as quickly as Mayfair Hams came
down. Tentative enquiries were made in
taking out a “put” option at 325., but
after the Ducon episode underwriters
seem to be somewhat scarce.
The other company to come back
into the portfolio was Vesta Battery.
A 10s. share selling at 3s. 3d. looks
pretty miserable, but so do the massive
losses in the last three years.
There has been a complete company
reorganisation management reshuffled,
about 110 of the staff laid off, manu-
facturing operations ceased, several
branches closed down and finally the
appointment to sell Prestolite batteries
in Australia and New Zealand. All
these changes must have had the desired
effect, for the company is now breaking
even.
It apparently has been too much for
a group of shareholders headed by one,
Robert A. Wenham. He called a special
meeting to try to remove four of the
existing directors.
To an outsider, this was baffling. If
in one year as managing director Mr A.
Hayes could turn a collapsing company
into a profitable venture, why shouldn’t
he and his board be allowed to remain
in office? The 1000 shares were bought
at 3s. 3d.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Dairy Industry’s New Look
Markets for Products in Various Guises
Tf the urgency of Australia’s need to
find new markets has for the time
being receded with the failure of Britain’s
Common Market bid, the dairy industry
seems not to have noticed.
Each week brings some development
that further frays the image of this in-
dustry as a sort of industrial hospital har-
boring thousands of disgruntled marginal
producers hobbling on the crutches of
a £l3-million subsidy at home and
coddled by a protected market abroad.
A symbol of the industry’s New Look
was the coming into operation a few days
ago of the nation’s first butter-oil plant
at the Foster factory of South-Eastern
Dairy Products, a Gippsland co-operative
with milk purchases of about £2i million
annually.
The company has been making about
5500 tons of butter a year. But butter
is a drug on the market, so it is diverting
the raw material for about a fifth of this
to the manufacture of an oil, which in
turn is the raw material for products
that will aid Australia’s dairy export
drive.
T>utter oil, containing 99.8 per cent
fat, compared with butter’s 82 per
cent, is made available by the Australian
Dairy Produce Board at a concessional
price, provided it is used either in Aus-
tralia for the manufacture of products
that will be exported to “non-traditional
markets” or sent abroad to be pro-
cessed in one of the recombining plants
which the Board is helping to establish
in Malaya, Thailand, the Philippines and
other Asian centres.
The Foster plant, costing £30,000 and
embodying the latest Swedish technique,
will bring the company no more profit
than butter-making, but will help to
strengthen the industry by spreading its
wares.
Meanwhile, on a different front in the
same campaign, CSIRO is building a
£15,000 pilot plant designed to simulate
every stage from cow to customer in the
processing of Australian dairy products
for Asia.
The plant, in the Melbourne suburb
of Highett, will speed up research on
recombining, provide a compact demon-
stration unit for visiting Asian technicians
and help scientists to evolve new forms
of food in which to dispose of Australia’s
mounting dairy production.
“We pull milk apart and play with the
blocks,” says Mr G. Loftus Hills, chief
of CSIRO’s dairy research division. As
a result, Australia may soon have pioneer-
ed a process for making a kind of cottage
cheese similar to a product that is popular
in India.
Co much pioneering, indeed, has this
organisation been doing lately that
it could not be blamed for becoming
bored about leading the world. Recently
it showed its pre-eminence in one field by
selling three cheddar-making machines to
Britain, the home of cheddar, which has
always, until the Australian invention,
been made there and elsewhere by hand.
Three more of the machines have been
exported to the United States and six
have been installed in Australia. “Within
five years,” said a Melbourne scientist,
“we hope to have a set-up where milk
will go in one end and packaged cartons
emerge from the other, and all the human
hand will touch is a button”.
On a private level, British United
Dairies (Aust.) has invaded Malaya, one
of the world’s richest dairy markets, with
a selling gimmick that has not been used
before. It consists of polythene bags of
powdered milk, each initial purchase be-
ing accompanied by a plastic canister
into which the housewife tips the contents
of the bag when she gets home.
Previously the company was selling
gas-packed tins on the markets, as were
its 16 or so competitors, but rivalry, par-
ticularly from the Dutch, was too strong,
and the tinned product had to be with-
drawn. The bagged powder is now under-
cutting its rivals and selling well enough
for a director of the firm to return from
Malaya with smiles all over his face.
Far East expansion has not, however,
diminished the industry’s attention to the
traditional British market. Just about
now, ia supermarkets and shops all over
Britain, Australian officials are unveiling
Australia’s latest promotion a new
brand of butter going by the name of
“Kangaroo”.
While Australians might think the
name would be better in zoos than shops,
a recent survey has filled its sponsors with
optimism by showing a “remarkable de-
gree of acceptance” with the British
public despite fears at a recent con-
ference of the Australian Primary Pro-
ducers’ Union that “Kangaroo” would
prove to millions of Britons that Australia
had succeeded in harnessing its famous
marsupial to the butter dish as well as
the soup plate.
At home, the Australian Dairy Produce
Board has just launched a campaign to
step up consumption of cheese. It has
sent 1500 circulars to hotels and res-
taurants throughout Australia in the hope
of resolving a paradox that troubles the
industry that while local production
of cheese in the past year has climbed
steeply, threatening an acute surplus, im-
ports of fancy cheese into Australia have
done the same.
The circulars, of which the recent batch
was the first in a regular two-monthly
series, tell hoteliers and restaurateurs
what cheeses are available from Austra-
lian manufacturers and how they can be
used in foods. They will try to encourage
more elaborate cheese courses in dining
rooms.
If the campaign succeeds in stimula-
ting local consumption, it will help ex-
ports by giving manufacturers a spring-
board from which to tackle more chal-
lenging markets.
An the production front, of importance
in an age when further improvement
in dairying efficiency depends largely on
mass breeding techniques, is the news that
the amount of semen given to cows in
Victoria, Australia’s main dairying State,
last year rose by more than 22,000 doses.
The news links itself with the an-
nouncement that Australia might soon
be supplying semen to Japan for artificial
breeding in a country where the herds,
averaging only two beasts each, are
mostly too small to afford the direct use
of bulls.
If all this has failed to brighten the
industry’s image at home, it has caught
many eyes in countries where we are
trying to forge new markets.
An expression of this was the comple-
tion recently by the NSW Department
of Agriculture of a design for a 1000-cow
dairy for the Singapore Government,
commissioned by the United Nations
adviser on agriculture to that country.
Mr F. A. Vernon, principal dairy officer
of the department, says the design could
become the pattern for the future in
Australia as the industry follows the
universal trend to bigness.
