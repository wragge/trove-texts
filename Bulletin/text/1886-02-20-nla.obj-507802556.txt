SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 20. 1886.
The Hon. Sam. Griffith, Piemier of
Queensland, is so greatly concerned about
the New Hebrides that he has made a bold
attempt to beat the record of his great rival,
Sir Thomas MTlwraith, and has gone one
better than Soudan Halley. Sir Thomas,
it will be remembered, was the Queensland
Premier who annexed New Guinea first and
consulted the Colonial Office after, and
whose action was, with some hesitation, re-
pudiated by the Imperial authorities. Mr.
Halley, as some people may recollect,
“saved England in her hour of need” by
sending troops to help in the Arab-patriot-
shooting. These troops arrived too late in
the season to participate in any of the prin-
cipal battues, but brought back a goat, and
were recruited by an additional donkey.
This interesting business, Mr. Halley and
his friends are accustomed to refer to
as “ an expression of the loyalty of the
people of Australia.” Thepeople of Austra-
however, have acquired an inconvenient
v trigk of laughing whenever the explosion of
T their loyalty is mentioned, and never hear
, of tbfeaffair or think of its projector with-
out being reminded of the Soudan donkey.
NMr. Griffith, probably perceiving that the
Uoyalty of Australians, considered in the
light of a lolly-pop to be offered for the
suction of British title-dealers, is about
played it in a different fashion.
Whereas Mr,. Halley used the article as
salt for the Imperial tail, Mr. Griffith
„©g?ploys it as powder for his little gun.
- loyal sentiments qf Australians would
, be ftffepted,” mutters Mr. Griffith in an
, offipia} .cablegram to bis Agent-General, “by

i their, interests in the New
That is to. say that Australian loyalty is

i, Griffith qap threaten ,its withdrawal un-

Gf the two, Mr. Griffiili is probably
nearer the truth. v Loyqlty is a sentiment
which is on tap gratis so long as, it. costs
nothing, especially when bestowal of it
appears calculated to benefit the donor.
But when interest is opposed to sentiment,
the result is generally similar to the in-
fluence which the appearacce of poverty is
proverbially said to have upon love. When
the one enters the door, the other flies out at
the window. We believe with Mr. Griffith
that should the British authorities neglect
or injure the interests of Australia, the
colonists of these regions would be found to
have just as much spirit as under simi-
lar circumstances the colonists of North
America had. In other words, that Mr.
Griffith is correct in threatening the
mother country with our disloyalty in the
event of our interests being sacrificed. But
tvhere Mr. Griffith is absurdly wrong is in
Pretending that Australians regard any
fiction which the Imperial authorities
may take, or omit to take, with respect
M' the New Hebrides, as in any way
affecting their interests. The only section
°f the Australian public who care a snip of
the lingers are the Presbyterian parsons
amt their few sympathisers. The rev
gentlemen have a mission station or so on
the New Hebrides, and have abo preten-
sions to having swindled the natives into a
sale of territory for Bibles and iron hoops,
°r similar honest value and foil consider-
ation.

The bulk of the Australian people are
'•totally indifferent New Hebrides,
And in such indifference they show their
sense, The future of Australia depends
upon the enterprise and energy expended
by Australians upon and within the mag-
nificent continent which they inhabit. Who-
ever, a hundred years hence, owns Aus-
tralia, must dominate the whole Pacific
Archipelago, no matter by whom the out-
lying groups be colonised. The thing is a
complete farce, and when Sam Griffith
cables to his Agent-General to inform the
Imperial authorities that a New Hebridean
matter can affect Australians to disloyalty,
he cables home a ridiculous lie.

The fact appears to be that the colonists
of Australia have been equally misrepre-
sented by Mr. Hadley affid by Mr. Griffith
to suit the respective designs of these two
THE RIGHT HON. H C. E. CHILDERS.
persons As a people, we neither so
imbued with an effusive and uncaloulating
loyalty to Great Britain as to w’sh to fling a
portion of our population to whatever part of
the Globe the British armies may be
directed, and to plunge recklessly into every
old-world contention which does not con-
cern these regions, nor are we so senseless,
so fractious, and so exacting, as to be ready
to abandon our affection for the mother
country unless her statesmen court quarrels
with any one of the Great Powers which
may feel a disposition to appropriate a
group of savage islands in mid-Paciflc,
nearer to their own colonies than to any
British possessions.
• ■ ■
The Australian people are, we believe,
cordially well affected to the mother country,
keenly appreciative of the consideration and
good-will repeatedly expressed and exhi-
bited towards them ; fully alive to the ad-
vantages of the Imperial connection under
existing conditions, and strong in the hope
that present relations may be long main-
tained, and, if possible, more closely
cemented. But they are, as a people, neither
wholly composed of sentimental enthusiasts,
nor of unreasoning fools. Among the most
reflective, ideas and convictions are
current, and are gainmg ground, that
in the future the best method of pre-
serving unstrained and affectionate relations
may be analogous to the process which is
constantly going on in families. That is to
say, when the young members of a family
arrive at maturity, and grow up to man’s
estate, they should set up for themselves,
and undertake the entire and independent,
management of their own affairs. Such a
course]does not operate to alienate affection.
It most distinctly tends to avert clashings
and to preserve kindly feelings which would
otherwise be certainly endangered. This is
a subject which has been infinitely beclouded
and muddled by the self-interested flunkey-
ism of title-huntiug humbugs on the one
hand, and the equally self-seeking provoca-
tions of popularity-hunters on the other.
Dalley laid at the feet of the throne a
loyalty which was of a spurious kind on the
one hand—toe mere heat ot au enthusiasm
confined to the thoughtless and unrestrained
merely because it involved no real sacrifices;
Griffith now threatens with a “disloyalty”
Just as unreal. Australians are not fools,
either way. They are neither loyal beyond
reason, nor will they be disloyal without
cause.
Twenty years ago, Ben. Wade, one of the
senators for Ohio, stated, in the American
Senate, that, by the close of the century,
every acre of fair agricultural land in the
Union would be worth 50 dollars or £lO. It
is now considered that the estimate was
much under the mark. The Republic covers
an area of 3,150,000 square miles or over two
billions of acres. Let us take another low
estimate, and suppose that of this vast
domain but one fourth was fit for cultiva-
tion. Thus, in 14 years from the present,
the arable land of the United States, most
of which by that time will have passed into
private hands, will represent the enormous
sum of £5,000,000,000. At a dollar or four shil-
lings an acre per annum a public income of
£100,000,000 a year would flow from this
source alone; or, at a rental of 4 per cent, on
the gross value, £200,000,000 per annum.
This, be it remembered, is exclusive of the
amounts derivable from the leasing of town
and suburban lands. With criminal reck-
lessness the Americans have gone on alien-
ating their birthright-frittering away their
noble heritage—until, as Gboroe remarks
“ Practically, there will soon cease to be any.
.... It will be a very short time before all
that men can turn to use will have an owner.
.... Our advanea has reached the Pacific.
Further west we cannot go, and increasing popu-
lation can but expand north and south. North, it
is already filling up the valley of the fled TUver,
pressing into that of the Saskatchewan and pre-
empting Washington territory; south, it is cover-
ing Western Texas and taking up the arable
valleys of New Mexico and Arizona. . . . Yet
it becomes no easier for the masses of our people
to make a living. On the contrary, it becomes
harder. The gulf between the employed and the
employer is growing wider. As liveried carriages
appear, so do barefooted children.
• • •
Let us turn to New South Wales. Here
the same blind policy—that of parting with
the fee-simple of the soil—that is now
causing such apprehension among thought-
ful Americans, is in full .swing. Owing to
the sparseness of the population in propor-
tion to the extent of territory, the gruesome
results have not yet begun to attract much
notice. But that they will become more
apparent as the years go by, and land alien-
ation marches hand-in-hand with increasing
population, is as certain as that the earth
spins round the sun. Present land-hunger
and future want stand to each other in the
relation of substance and shadow. The law
governing them is as inexorable as that of
long division. New South Wales has an area
of 196,000,000 acres. Of this, 7,000,000 were
alienated prior to 186). Prom the latter
year up to the end of 1884, 17,000,000 acres
passed through into private hands, making
a total of 24,000,000, or about one-eighth of
the whole. There is little doubt that in the
area so disposed of will be found most of
the choice lots of the colony. Even now, the
selector has to go far afield before meeting
with unclaimed ground possessing perma-
nent water and promising soil. Still, his
difficulties are slight, -in comparison with
those his children will meet. As fresh
mouths come to be reckoned by the million
instead of by the thousand, and as the value
of land advances with equal steps, the
foolishness of having enriched the few out
of the patrimony of the many, will cause
colonists of to-morrow to deplore the short-
sightedness of those of to-day. With the
example before them of the evils neces-
sarily resulting from allowing private
property in laud, it is humiliating to
think that the people look on apathetically
and give no sign. Suppose that, of the
total area of the colony, one-fourth was
suitable for agriculture—we make ad-
visedly a low estimate. At an annual ren-
tal of 4s. per acre £10,000,000 sterling a year
—when the whole was leased—would flow
into the Treasury, This income would grow


with the growth of population and conse-
quent advance in land value. And if it be
said that many years would have to elapse
before lessees could be found for the cul-
tivable soil, it should be remembered that
during these years the value of the ground
was not at a stand-still but growing apace.
Daily wo see private owners return from
long sojourns abroad to find the value of
their property doubled or quadrupled, not
through any efforts of theirs, but through
causes over’which they have no control.
Similarly, unoccupied public lands would
increase in worth, thus enabling the State
—or, in other words, the people—to secure
the increment which, but for them, would
never have accrued. The public opinion
which recognises as lawful and just the claim
of the individual to appropriate the wealth
for which others toiled, and which but for
them would have no existence, is opposed
to reason and cannot last.
♦ • •
Bui it may last long enough to cause
grave mischief, as in the case of America—
mischief which even in that country has not
yet i cached its acutest stage. For when no
more unclaimed land is to be found be-
tween Rhode Island and San Francisco, and
no unoccupied continent to be discovered
farther west, questions which dull politi-
cians now affect to comider impractical and
U topian will be forced to the front and de-
ma id solution in tones which will not
I r iok delay. That time is almost at hand.
Tt re is no doubt that but for the posses-
k.i ) v an English-speaking people of the
vast tenUory extending from the Gulf of
Mexico to the Arclic.circle'the English land
question would long since have been settled
in a manner not pleasant to dwell upon—a
manner more closely resembling the French
method of 1709 than the British of 1832.
The prairies relieved the pressure. It is as
well to remember, however, that new con-
tinents are not picked up every day, that
the supply appears to have run out, and that
some solution besides expatriation will
shortly be in demand. To return to New
South Wales. During over TO years—from
the arrival of the first convict ships to 18G1—
but 7,000,000 acres were alienated. Daring
the next 20 years twice that amount was
lost to the community. To say, therefore,
that as only one-eighth of the colony passed
into private hands during a century, there
is no need to hurry, is to mislead. As is
alleged of population, alienation increases
in geometrical progression. If suffered to
proceed unchecked, it is doubtful whether—
leaving out reserves—an acre of land
capable of profitable use would be owned by
the State by tho time the country possessed
4,000,000 of people, some 40 years hence. This,
which many look upon with composure, we
regard with grave misgiving. When it is
borne in mind that in the western district of
Victoria are hundreds of square miles of
country for which the lucky owners obtain
a rental of from £5 to £lO an acre per
annum, and that in New South Wales is to
be found land equally prolific, the magni-
tude of our folly will suggest itself. In
estimating the revenue derivable from
country lands, we have purposely kept
the figures low. It is when specula-
ting on the rentals paid in other
countries that the modest figures to
which we have limited ourselves assume
dimensions fairly bewildering. Before,
however, the views we have enunciated can
he reduced to practice, the idea that land
will not be judiciously used unless private
property in it is allowed, must be destroyed.
How such an opinion arose in face of so
many proofs of its unsoundness is curious.
Most of the land in the United Kingdom is
cultivated by tenants. Upon leased ground
most of the London buildings, and many of
the American ones, are built. In the centre
of San Francisco is a fine block of buildings,
the ground rent of which goes to a School
Fund, instead of into a landlord’s pockets.
In England large tracts of land, which, if
public property, would be under crop, are
idle through the owner’s caprice. In
America large tracts lie unused till the
pressure of population forces buyers to
give the fancy prices demanded by the
owners. What is it to the tenant whether
his rent is placed to the landlord’s credit or
finds its way into the coffers of the state?
No' more grotesque error ever arose than
that of supposing that land would not be
made the most of unless private property
in it was allowed.
* * •
SO far, wo have dealt with the country
alone. If town lands are considered the
impolicy of parting with the fee-simple be-
comes more obvious still. Take Sydney, for
instance. Does anyone suppose that less
costly buildings would be found in its
streets or suburbs if instead of freeholds a
fixed ground rent for a certain number of
years had been tne rule? To suppose so
would be to consider the people altogether
different from those of London or New
York, where the most expensive hoims
are erected on rented ground. In
fact, universal experience is against
tho assumption that land, whether in
town or country, will only be turned to the
best account when exclusively possessed.
Is there a remedy, then, for. the state of
things which, in England, has resulted in .a
state of chronic discontent, sometimes ap-
proaching revolution—in America has
aggravated poverty and fomented troubles,
the end of which no man can foresee —and
in the colonies has led many to look on
private property in land as the social evil
which dwarfs all others by comparisons?
We know of but one. The stoppage of alien-
ation and the resumption of the land.
• • •
In England such a step is beset with diffi-
culties ; in the United States the difficulties,
although great, are much less than in Britain
—with us, the way is open and easy. This is
because of the comparatively small amount
of land alienated. Take Sydney for ex-
ample. So rapid has been its recent growth,
and so assured is its future, that had all the
freeholders within a radius of 10 miles from
the General Post-office been bought out 12
or 15 years ago, the advance in values since
that time would not only have paid them a
fair interest on the price, but would have
cleared off the principal and left the ground
unencumbered public property once more.
As the people spread and new houses were
built, the annual excess of rents over in-
terest due on the purchase money would
have formed a sinking fund which, ju-
diciously invested from time to time, would
to-day meet all liabilities. Or, take the
Sydney of the present. It is probable that
within the radius we have mentioned a
quarter of a million of people would be
found. In 20 or 25 years that number will
be doubled. Government bonds bearing in-
terest at 4 per cent., and redeemable
long before the half-million of people
was reached could be safely issued to land-
owners. All this, of course, is on the as-
sumption that the majority of the com-
munity have been brought to see what
Mill, with characteristic acuteness, saw
years ago—that, by all the laws of reason
and justice, the unearned increment of land
belongs to the State, So long as people
think that a person has a perfect right to
let his land lie idle until public necessity
multiplies the price twenty-fold, then step \
in and demand the augmented value caused
by the wants of others, so long will persons
residing in the eastern suburbs have an op-
portunity of contemplating barren sand-
hills, whose absent owner need take no heed
for the morrow, conscious that thousands
of men he never saw are mindful of his
business while minding their own. For the
sake of illustration, let us say that the price
of the area in question is £10,000,000. The
yearly interest to be paid on this would be
£400,000. Where should the sum be obtained ?
From the rents of the resumed lands.
How, then, pay off the principal when it
became due in 10 or 15 years ? By the fund
created by the constant increase of rents.
But, it may be objected, suppose rents do
not increase? As well might it be said,
“suppose population does not increase?”
Place a million of people in a fruitful terri-
tory capable of supporting sixty millions in
comfort, and they must increase unless
means are adopted to thwart Nature. Even
if, in consequence of the defeat of the mother
country, the colony passed under a foreign
flag, as Canada did over a century ago, the
growth of population would not be stayed.
And advance in rents must accompany such
growth. In England rural lands have a
downward tendency caused by the tenants
being unable to pay the enormous rents
demanded, and at the same time compete
with the vast grain-growing plains of
Western America. But it is certain that in
the New South Wales of four millions land
will be much dearer and rents much higher
than they are now. Until possession of the
soil is resumed and the right to private pro-
perty in it denied, the spectacle of indolent
men living on the industry of others—reap-
ing what they did not sow, and spending
what they did not earn—will continue.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Capital Punishment in Switzerland.
A statemest has gone the round of the papers
and has been repeated with marked persistency, to
the effect that capital punishment has been re-
stored in Switzerland—implying, of course, that a
trial of abolition had proved unsatisfactory. To
understand what has really taken place it must be
known that in 1874 a change in the Constitution
extended the Central Authority and destroyed
Cantonal independence. The Central Authority
abolished capital punishment throughout Switzer-
land. Chafing under the new Constitution, a de-
mand was made that each Canton should have the
right to enact its own laws relating to the punish-
ment of capital crimes. The question was put to
the vote whether the article of the Constitution
forbidding capital punishment should be rescinded
or not. To this qutstion 195,000 voters answered
“Yes,” and 180,000 "No,” thus rescinding the
article by a majority of 15,000 in 375,000. “ It will
be observed,” said a Swiss correspondent of the
London Times at the time, “ how nearly equally
opinion is divided, and whatever weight th?
slender majority may have, it loses much
of its importance when certain circumstances
are taken into account which, with your per-
mission, I will proceed briefly to mention. To begin
with, the largest cantons in Switzerland, Zurich
and Berne, have said * No,’ and this has also been
the decision in most cases by large majorities of
cantons Bale, Neuchatel, Geneva, and Tessin, and
tho cities of Frieburgh, Chur, Liestal, Olten
Aarau, St, Gall, Thun, and Luzern. The altera-
tion of the OoostjtuUqti rewiys4 aMt support' in
the country districts of the Catholic cantons and
in the Canton de Vaud. It is certain, however
that the Pays de Vaud has no Intention to rein-
troduce the punishment of death. Why, then*
has a large majority voted ‘Yea?’ To under-
stand this it must be remembered that a large
minority voted against the acceptance of the Con-
stitution of 1874 from a jealousy of the Extension
of Central Authority. . . . There la little
doubt the vote given on Sunday was Intended as
a protest in favour of cantonal independence. . . •
The position of affairs there is simply this: Each
canton has now the right to re-establish the death
penalty, but for the reason I have suggested it is
certain very few will do so.” Now that the truth
of the matter is published we sincerely trust that
w e shall read no more—in the colonial Press at
least-aboutthe “restoration of capital punish-
ment in Switzerland.”

A New Evangelist.
Whether Christianity will be strengthened by the
advocacy of .Mr. David Buchanan, the Sydney
barrister, remains to be seen. So far, we are not
aware of his having brought forward any proofs
that were unknown to Hume, Gibbon, Voltaire,
Paine, Mill, or Buckle. Why those men, and
hosts of others equally able, refused to accept, as
true, the evidence that seems so convincing to
Mr. Buchanan can scarcely be answered by the
easy assumption that they were “ shallow blas-
phemers.” It is probable that the " essays on
Miracles,” and on “ Liberty,” the “ Decline and
Fall,” the voluminous works of M. Arouet, the
“Rights of Man,” and the “History of Civilisa-
tion,” will be read when this new apologist and
his works “ shall have faded into the infinite azure
of the past.” David sent his “ proofs ” to our
late Viceroy accompanied with an essay on
drunkenness, and the answers of Lord Loetus are
literary curiosities. Inter alia his lordship says:—
“ It is, I think, to be regretted that such free scope
is given to free thought. ... I believe, and
am convinced, that your able defence of Christi-
anity so lucidly and so powerfully argued, has
worked great good, and that many have been
thereby led to reflect and to halt on their down-
ward path of unbelief. ... It has ever been a
subject of regret to me since I arrived in the
colony, that in the education of the rising gener-
ation, there is no religious education enforced.”
His lordship might have remembered that in
Europe, for 1400 years, religion was not alone
1 taught, but enforced, in a manner to which he
probably would be the last to revert—that this
teaching was largely instrumental in giving
us 14 centuries of rapine and massacre, ending
with the French Revolution. It was in the
States of the Church and of Southern Italy that
this method of instruction was brought to its
highest perfection, with the result that the pea-
sant who trembled before a wax Madonna would,
for a few coppers, rise from his knees to cut a
throat. And it had full swing in Mexico and South
America also with somewhat similar results. To
come nearer home, our own “ Hodge ” was for
generations taught that a straw bed, with garbage
for food, would end in sempiternal bliss. His
teachers somewhat inconsistently hoped for the
same future happiness while enjoying dainty fare
and beds of down here below. The consequence
was that if the British rustic appears to no better
advantage in Heaven than on earth he will
find few to associate with him there. No
greater mistake was ever made than that of sup-
posing that religion—as ordinarily understood-
is at the root of morality. What becomes of such
a moral superstructure when the religious foun-
d ation gives way ? The morality that is not
robust enough to walk alone without conventional
religion for a crutch Is a sickly thing at
Why, if Mr. Buchanan and Lord Loetus believed
what they would fain have others taught, they
would not be well-dressed and well-fed while so
many thousands of their countrymen were living
on offal and shivering in rags. So it is “ much to
be regretted that such free scope is given to free-
thought.” No doubt it is-from his lordship's
standpoint. For, when men come to be guided bi-
reason and by untrammelled thought, he and
his class will cease to usurp the places intended
by Nature for more gifted men,

The London Biots.
The British Constitution is once more in danger.
Of all the Impostures which have cursed the folly
of too credulous mankind few have been more
ridiculous than this same Constitution, Its pane-
gyrists invariably describe it as the highest em-
bodiment of political wisdom. They vaunt its
strength, and boast above all its elasticity. Yet
these very persons are the first to show by their
actions that their laudation is insincere. On the
slightest appearance of any stress, they shriek
with apprehension for the Constitution, suspend
its application, and rely for effective use upon any
expedient that is handy, outside the Constitution.
The Constitution*, in fact, is treated like the
Sword of State. It looks splendid when carried
before the Sovereign on ceremonial occa-
sions, but when battles have to be fought
the rough - ground cutlass is the article
brought into requisition. So long as every section
of the British people are content to defer to
existing conditions, even if these impose upon
millions lives of hopeless wretchedness—the
Constitution is held aloft and hymned. But the
moment there are indications of a strong deter-
mination to expedite change more rapidly than
suits the convenience of the prosperous class, the
Constitution is either openly suspended or cun-
ningly violated. The Englishman’s liberties of
free speech, of free Press, of public meeting, are
rights which he is perpetually told to congratu-
late himself upon. They are, he is informed, in-
violable—and so they are so long as he turns them
to no serious account. The Hyndmans and
Morris's, and Champions— the Republican ad-
vocates, and the Socialistic propagandists, are not
interfered with so long as they appear insignifi-
cant and impotent, and the fact is continually
referred to as illustrative of the genuine
and comprehensive liberty secured by the
British Constitution. But tho moment there
is an appearance of real effects being pro-
duced by their teachings, they are harassed and
persecuted with a vigor and unscrupulousness
proportioned to tho extent of their influence.
The prosecution of the Socialist leaders in conueo
tion with the recent riot in London is not, it m ug .
be borne in mind, the commencement of the trou
ble. These propagandists were, during the recent
brief and accidental tenure of power by the Toriea
hounded down by the police ; their open-air meet*
ings were dispersed on frivolous and transparently
specious pretexts, and municipal regulations
which were latent with regard to all other meet,
ings were enforced with vindictive and vexatious
severity against them. Should they gain further
headway—and we know of no process better cal.
culatod to stimulate attentive consideration of
thsir principles than the prosecutions just ordered
-there would doubtless be repeated in England the
device ordinarily employed under like conditions
both there and in Ireland. The Habeas Corpus Act
would be suspended, and the British Constitution
of which that Act is an integral part, shelved until
circumstances would again permit it to be
out again to dazzle the eyes of fools with its
spurious lustre. It is perfectly obvious that not
one of the Socialist leaders was a participant in
the riots. Had they been, the tidings would have
been Hashed with triumphant alacrity to every
corner of the globe. They had delivered addresses.
Their genuine disciples and followers had, in the
London parks, been supplemented by the Idle
crowd, which, owing to the universal distress
afflicting the operative class, is but too numerous
and by the ordinary rag-tag of a!great city]
and a demonstration was converted, first
into a riot, and then into a loot. Hynd-
man and his colleagues are to be prosecuted
for inciting the mob. A conviction should be
easy. Apart from all questions of mob outrage
there would be little difficulty in procuring coil
victions against St. Simon, Lassallb, Karl
Marx, and other leaders of Social Reform on their
mere published opinions. Their philosophy con-
demns legalised robbery of the worker. And the
robbers happen, also, to be the law-makers.
Naturally they have laws to protect themselves.*
The lot of Hyndman and his associates is merely
that which all previous reformers have had to
face. The principles of Social Reform are dealt
with in the same spirit as were the principles of
the Anti-Corn Law League. Mr. John Mouldy,
now Chief Secretary for Ireland in Mr. Glad-
stone’s new Administration, drew the parallel in
advance,.in his “Life of Cobden,” thus:—
“ In England it is certain that the amazing vigour
and resolution of the League was regarded with
intense disfavour by great and important classes
The League was thoroughly out of fashion. It
was regarded as violent, extreme, and not respect-
able. A year before, it had usually been described
as a selfish and contemptible faction. By the end
of 1813 things had become more serious. The
notorious pamphleteer of the Quarterly Rb-
view now denounced the League as the foulest and
most dangerous combination of recent times. The
Times spoke of Cobden, Bright, and their allies,
as ‘ capering mercenaries who go frisking about
the eountry;’ as authors of incendiary clap-trap:
as peripatetic orators pulling themselves into
easy popularity by Second-Hand arguments. They
were constantly accused of retarding their own
cause, and frightening away respectable people by
their violence. Violence, as usual, denoted nothing
more than that they knew their own minds, and
pressed their convictions as if they were in earnest.
In the early part of the autumn there had been a
furious turn-out of the operatives in the mills,
and later on in the season ricks had been burnt in
the midland and southern counties. The League,
in spite of the fact that its leaders were nearly all
mill-owners, or connected with manufactures, was
accused of promoting these outrages. There were
loud threats of criminal proceedings against the
obnoxious confederacy. It was rumoured on the
Manchester Exchange that the Government had
resolved to put down the League as an association
constituted against the law of the land. If neces-
sary, a new law would be made to enable them to
suppress a body so seditious. This heat in the
minds of the ruling class made them anxious at
almost any cost to destroy Cobden, who was now
openly recognised as the foremost personage ih
i the detested organisation.”

The Last Pizz,
The last Fizz of the Soudan fireworks entertain-
ment spluttered on Saturday last, when some 500
men, of whom the intelligent wore a shamefaced
air, re-assembled to be adorned with medals which
they, In common .with everyone present,
were conscious they had not won. This
episode was a most fitting conclusion to
an affair which commenced by a betrayal
of the Constitution of N.S.W. into participa-
tion in a cold-blooded expedition of slaughter
which has been condemned by the best and truest
Britons. The English emissary t o this colony, of
course, did no more than his duty in endeavour-
ing to invest with eeldt an affair, the ten
dency of which is to entangle our peace-
ful and industrial community in every
squabble at the ends of the earth, and to convert
our colony into a recruiting ground for British
Jingoes. The ruling caste in the Old Country are
always hard-up for soldiers when a war is under*
taken to suit their designs. Home-staying
Englishmen show every year a more profound
disinclination to enlist, and the recruiting sergeant
finds his supply limited to the floating margins of
rattle-brains and chumps who fringe every
population. The most reliable and permanent
resource is still, however, the unfortunate c;afl3
who find themselves jammed between the alterna-
tives of starvation or enlistment. It is conse-
quently of some importance to the Imperial
authorities to cajole and pet the colonists into
a proper spirit of self-sacrifice in this r®‘
spect. And it is of just equal importance to
colonists not to permit themselves to be hum-
bugged into any such folly. The man who
succeeds in making fools of them to that extent
is always sure of the offer of a knighthood,
the men who are befooled are sure of nothing—
not even of a fight to cool their blood by the
murder of poor naked patriots; not even of bread
when they return unharmed. It was
only the other day that a large number of
the men of the Contingent met at the Hyde
Park statue in Sydney to unite in begging for em-
ployment. This, Indeed, was the opporufflß>
to show how highly their services were esteenjeu*
and how genuine the sympathy with them, uu
on that occasion no guard of honour was tpfd-o*J
to encircle them; Lord Carington did not tne
make his appearance in Lancer uniform to ah"*

was urgently detainee from presenting Mmseß i

with a medal and butter.

Ellen vale, Townsville, Aug:, 18, 1885.
Gentlemen,—l have much pleasure in advising
you that I have used St. Jacob’s Oil in my family
for sore throat and rheumatic pains with great
success, and consider it one of the best remedies
ever put before the public. I have also used it
upon my poultry for croup and throat disorders,
and have always found it give immediate relief
I would recommend every poultry farmer to trv
it, and they will find that their coops, instead of
being: empty, wilt be tilled with strong, healthy
poultry,—Yours faithfully, ’ y
C. WELLINGTON.
(Note.—A drench of from two to five drops 8t
Jacob’s Oil, diluted with warm water, is a really
simple, reliable, and harmless remedy for any in-
ternal disorders of poultry. We believe Mr. Wel-
lington s success has been almost phenomenal
whilst some of his neighbours have suffered very
heavy losses.) J
The proprietor of Wolfe's Schnapps has
succeeded in making a spirit which is appreciated
by the whole world.
Kind friends think of us particularly at
wedding time. Thoughts spur us to action. Ac-
tions take the form or mementos, and these latter
assume various forms. Difficulty in the way of
selecting presents ministered to by seeking the
assistance of Bray Brothers, 403 and 404 George-
street. A more beautiful lot of goods, whether
for use or adornment, than their sets for dinner
breakfast, tea, dessert, or toilet, statuary, vases
and fancy glass, it would be impossible to find in
the colony.*
Every year Wolfe’s Schnapps gains in
favour with a discerning public, while other
liquors are cast into oblivion.

Joseph Arch, M.P.
Joseph Arch, the labour representative in the
English House of Commons for Norfolk, is a man
to whom the term “ practical ” can be properly
applied. His election is chiefly owing to the
support of the Agricultural Labourers Union, an
organisation which he himself formed under very
great difficulties and dangers. This Union, which
had its small beginning in the village ;of Well-
bourne “under a spreading ches(tnut-tree,” now
has branches all over England, and has alreadv
done much to ameliorate the condition of
labourers throughout the kingdom. Mr. Arch
has learnt, by personal experience, the troubles
that afflict the class which he represents.
He is the son of a laborer, whose toil returned
him the munificent sum of Da. a week, which
amount was supplemented by the 3s. that his
mother was able to get for a week’s charring. The
boy Joseph had to go to work at a very early age,
but in spite of his inoessant toil he managed to add
to the scanty teaching given to him by his mother
a stock of learning which enabled him to read and
then led him to study the cause of the oppression
of his class. His own wage as a laborer was 9s. a
week, and with this sum he had to provide for his
own wants and those of a small family.
Thought led to action, and in 1873, when he
was 50 years of age, undeterred by the
threats of the masters, he founded the Union with
which his name has subsequently been so closely
identified. As a speaker he is vigorous, clear, and
so fluent that even the best of shorthand writers
have considerable difficulty in keeping up with
him. His efforts have been of immense benefit to
the class whose cause he has championed.
H. C. E. Childers, M.P.
The Right Hon. Hugh Culling Bardley Childers is
the son of a Yorkshire clergyman, and was born
In 1827, When only 33 years of age he emigrated
to Victoria with his wife, and, being elected for
Portland, became very shortly afterwards a mem-
ber of the existing Government. In 1857 he re-
turned to England as Agent-General for Victoria,
and in 1860 was elected to the Commons for Ponte-
fract. He became First Lord of the Admiralty in
Gladstone’s Ministry of 1860, but resigned on
account of ill-health in 1871. In 1873 he again be-
came Agent-General for Victoria, but when the
Liberals returned to power in 188# he accepted
office, first as Secretary for War, and subsequently
as Chancellor of the Exchequer in Gladstone s
Ministry, which latter position he held until the
defeat of that party in 1885, Defeated for Ponte-
fract at the recent general election, he succeeded
m obtaining election at Edinburgh one of the
divisions of which town he now represents.

Sydney, Wednesday.
Dear Belle,-Of course the big event of the
week was the distribution of the Soudan medals,
which took place on Saturday last at the Agricul-
tural Grounds. It was a queer show, dear, and
we eked out not a little amusement during the
afternoon. Most of the Contingent men were in
their ordinary work-day clothes, and presented
anything but a soldierly appearance as they
sheepishly shambled up to the Governor upon
their names being called to receive their hard-
earnedj(?) rewards. Some of them put on an air
of importance which was truly ludicrous, whilst
others grinned from ear to ear with embarrassment
like overgrown school hoys receiving their first
prizes for good conduct. The Governor looked
bored and handsome, as he shook hands with the
men and handed them their medals at the same
time, but he worried through the whole affair
with a patient good humour, and was only once
heard to urge the men to " come quicker.” Some
of the funny men around the dais tried to per-
suade us that the band had been ordered
to play the “ Dead March ” in honour of
the poor little defunct goat, and that the
renowned donkey was to receive a medal also;
hut you know, dear, men are always inclined to
become facetious in order to relieve their feelings
during a proceeding fraught with monotony, and
JOSEPH ARCH, M.P.
m which they take no active part, so we forgave
them when we discovered that neither goat nor
donkey bad any place in the programme. Nobody
seemed sorry when all the medals were distributed,
and Lady Carington, accompanied by Miss Har-
bord and Mr. Wallington, drove up In a carriage
and four, and at once alighted. It was a remark-
able fact that not one bit of enthusiasm was dis-
played until Lady Carington (who came in riding
costume), mounted a handsome charger, and,
accompanied by the Governor, Inspected the
ranks. It was a pretty sight to see the prancing
steeds, with their riders in handsome uniforms,
stepping along to a nice march accompaniment
played excellently hy the band. I always did
think a man looks his very best in a becoming
uniform astride a magnificent horse, and I had no
occasion to change my opinion on Saturday.
Dozens of glasses were levelled on one rider in
particular, with broad, square shoulders, a
long sweeping blonde moustache, and a fearless
eye, the tout ensemble making our very beau ideal
of a soldier. We all adored him, dear, and lam
sure he would have felt flattered had he been
aware of our wholesale admiration. We were ail
rather surprised to find that Mr. Lambie (who,
you may remember, went with the Contingent as
correspondent to one of the papers, and got shot
in one of his limbs) received no medal. It seemed
to us that he had faced as many dangers as the
rest of the drew, and yet he got no recognition.
But. at all events, I expeet he takes more pride in
in his bullet-wound scar than in all the medals in
the world. It is a good thing this Contingent
business is ended atfiast, for, as you may well
imagine, we are all heartily tired of it.
Ned went to Mons. Kowalski’s banquet in the
evening, which was tendered to that clever musi-
rftm by his many ardent admirers. It was held in
Baumann’s Cafd, and, I hear, was excellently car-
ried ont. The menu was printed on pink-satin,
and was a work of art in itself, and I believe
Baumann quite excelled himself in the multitude
of choice dishes he provided for the company. I
believe there were about 60 gentlemen present
mostly foreigners, however, and the affair ter-
minated pleasantly at about midnight.
I am sorry to acknowledge it, but positively the ■
total absence of gallantry, tven common manners,
in some of our Sydney middle class men, Is quite
appalling. Iwent into the Railway Refreshment-
room one day last week in order to get a glass of
iced lemonade before the train started, but as I
was about to give my order to the serving girl a
big man reached over my shoulder and throwing
a silver piece on the counter demanded some
lemonade at once, as he had to catch his train. My
blood boiled a little, though, the day being hot,
I made a big effort to keep cool; but
when another and yet another man came
and took advantage of their superior height
and loud voices, and quite ignored the rule
of “first come first served,” I timidly sug-
gested to the girl that, as I too had the same
train to catch, it was only fair I should have my
share of attention, especially as I had waited so
long. I daresay you have often noticed, dear, that
these counter girls never see a lady customer as
long as some of the other sex require to be waited
upon, and I don’t blame them a bit, for I believe I
should do just the same, for “ ’tis our nature to,”
so I wasn’t at all surprised when this girl
in question demanded in a saucy voice,
“ What is it you want, then ? ” No, my
anger didn’t fall upon her one bit, but I
couldn’t help being deeply grieved to think
that just for the sake of remaining thirsty for
half-an-hour or so, or missing a train, they
could so far forget themselves as to bo both rude
and inconsiderate to one of the weaker sex. I
sincerely hope that these were just a chance lot,
and not fair specimens of Sydney manhood—or
woe to us in time of war or trouble if it is to such
as these we shall have to look to for protection I
But, after all, these poor apologies for men aren’t
worth a thought.
Do you believe in prophecies, ma chirred I con-
fess I used when a child to live in great dread of
the final smash-up of the world fixed by Mother
Shlpton for 1881. The anticipation of the great
end isn’t pleasant when one is very young and
hasn’t had time to become a bit weary of life
consequent on the many bitter experiences we ail
have to undergo, more or less, so when that
dreaded year came and went just the same as its
predecessors I lost all my faith in prophecies for
ever. It appears that Michel Notre-Dame, the
freat French astrologer, foretold that when Good
riday should fall on St. George’s Day, Easter on
St. Mark’s Day, and Corpus Christi on St. John’s
Dav, then would he the end of everything. As it
is a fact that all these conditions will be fulfilled
this year, I suppose the believers in Notre Dame
will spend most of their time in prayer, and get
absolution for their sins all in’readiness, and at the
end of 1886 they will look as foolish as all weak-
minded people do who pay any attention to the
prophecies of man. Why, if our cleverest men
fail in their prognostications of the weather, how
is it possible they can foretell greater events ?
I have been puzzling my head for the past week
or two to guess why the magpieish combination
of black and white had obtained fashion’s appr®-
val. The combination is, as I have no doubt you
have noticed, becoming only to a few, unless,
Indeed, the blending is very artistic, besides which
it has such a half-mourning look. Blit a letter I
received yesterday from my devoted continental
correspondent explains all. She tells me that
black and white costumes are worn almost univer-
sally out of compliment to poor King Alfonso, and
thus we follow the fashion here, never dreaming
that there is a meaning attached to it. The nicest
gown of this description (Alfonso gown I call it) I
have seen here was at the Theatre Royal the other;
night, and consisted of a rich black merveilleux
satin with bold facings of pure white velvet,
and long train of the same. The effect was lovely,
and I think it must have been an imported gown,
for I don’t believe there is a brain in Sydney big
enough or artistic enough to conceive such. And
talking of things artistic—not gowns, however,
this time—reminds me of a story which comes
from the backwoods of America. At a certain
art school (fancy an art school out in the Par
West), the students being very ambitious, in-
formed their master that they considered them-
selves capable of drawing the figure from the
antique. Accordingly, a few easts from some of
the famous models were sent for, and upon arrival
Clytie, Psyche, and the Apollo Belvidere were un-
packed, and gave the greatest satisfaction to the
students, but when the Yenus of Milo, with her
arms broken off short, was placed before their ex-
pectant eyes, their anger knew no bounds. Their
indignation was so great that they actually took
an action for damages against the railway com-
pany for the disgusting carelessness of their
officials, who had broken the arms off one of their
best models. The story goes on to say that the art
school actually won the suit, and recovered heavy
damages. But this, dear, you must take with a
grain of salt, as most American “ yarns ” require it.
The cricket match played in the Domain last
Monday afternoon between the Press and Parlia-
ment was a particularly interesting affair to—
well, to the members o Press and Parliament and
their friends. By the time we arrived the Press
men were looking rather doleful in their antici-
pation of a beating, but hey seemed to pluck up a
little courage when they observed about a score of
laoies seat tnemselves in the visitors tent, and ap-
parently take an interest in the play. It pains me
much to own it, but I must confess that our literati
don’t shine at cricaet. Their fielding was. upon
this occasion exusperatingiy muffish, but perhaps
the dear fellows got cogitating about next day's
leading articles, so that when a ball surprised them
they had to tear their thoughts from the “ Water
Supply” “Lambton Strike,” and the like, before
rfßhsed the fact that they had made a most
miBB- , Hut, however, they were pretty
good humoured over it all, and it was quite a
pleasant afternoon for all of us. We fell to wish-
IS? tl i® y would have these sociable contests oftener
tboy do. During the afternoon the ladles
were invited into the ‘ House ” grounds to partake
of refreshments which were laid out in a large
marquee. We left the Press still manfully trying
to make a decent score, but heard later on that
d&Tb/fWute;. tl,< ’“ olTes ““kk’w
At last we are having “ Called’Back ” at the
Theatre Royal, and every night, so far, has seen
B Packed house. A whisper got abroad on Monday
that the Vice-regal party intended to patronise
the play that night, so all the ladies donned their
very best costumes for the occasion. The
rumour was quite correct, for, just before
tne second act, the expected ones put in
an appearance, and It was quite funny to hear
the orchestra break off in the middle of a waltz, or
something, to play the National Anthem. Both
Lady Carington and Mias Harbord show very quiet
taste m their theatre or concert-room attire. This
night Lady Carington wore black grenadine and a
lovely cluster of pink roses on her corsage. Miss
Harbord, a cream dress made high to the neck and
elbow sleeves. Miss Kate Bishop wears a most
exquisite gown in one of the acts. It is simply a
paie-pink plush with a long train, the sole trim-
ming being loops of broad pink ribbons. With this
dress she wears a charming pink hat, and the
whole makes up a delicious picture,
Hady Carington holds another reception to-day.
and if I don t go at once and dress I shall as-
toelgxf behind ’ 00 1 wUI merely stay just
Yours, as ever.

Henniker Heaton is now a Tory of Tories.
He is so blue-blooded that if you were to cut his
jugular by accident fluid indigo would spout out
with the force of the Yan Yean. But we remem-
ber that when Henniker first left Australia to
dabble in English politics he finessed with what
the S. M. Herald am Argus writers call “ Fenian-
iem,’ and was so proud of having been driven
round in Ireland by Parnell that accounts of the
outing appeared in no end of colonial papers.
A correspondent of the Sydney Town and
Country Journal states that at the recent
summer meet of the T.T. Club, at viowbray, Tas-
mania, “ His Excellency Sir George Cumine
Strahan, K C M.G , and Lady Strahan were pre-
sent each day ia the vice-regal box.” As Sir
George has always been regarded as the “most
eligible bachelor ” in Tasmania, this statement
must cave created a momentary shock to be taken
with the proverbial grain of salt. But if it be
true 11!
A certain lord, about whom much was
heard a few years is ago, is about to return to
England Horn one of the Australian colonies,
where he has been lying low “ waiting for It to
blow over.” A recent number of London Society
describes his lordship as “ a man whose faults
were entirely of tbe head, not the heart, and who
was ‘ nobody’s enemy but his own.’”
Fair words to plaster over
Caused something like a “ ruction.”
Extortion was the head’s slight fault;
The heart’s, of course, Seduction.
Mr. Justice Kerferd, the new Victorian

wfcat some of the locals (Maryborough) consider
to have been nothing more than a drunken spree.
Anyway, the juty recommended the three young
fellows to mercy on account of it “ being an ag-
gravated case on both sides.” In passing sentence
that judicial quality of mind for which Mr. Ker-
ferd is remarkable (ride Mr. James Service’s speech
in defence of the “ job ’) peeped out. His Honor
discovered, by reference to his book, that tho par-
ticular cffenca of these prisoners Is punishable by
15 years. So he split it up among the three, and
gave them five years each. “ Oh, most just judge.”

At the Bathurst (N.P.W.) Ass’zes all the
principal prisoners defended by David
Buchanan, and he got them ail out of it. This is
the way they carry on ia Court there. A woman
was prosecuting a town Lothario for breaking
into her house in her husband’s absence Now for
a piece of the report:—Witness here looked at
prisoner and smiled, shaking her head at him.
Mr. Buchanan accused her of winking at prisoner,
but amidst the laughter of the jury the witness
declared that she had only smileu at him.” And
later to David—“ I did not giia at the prisoner
just now, I simply smiled ; my reason ior so doing
is that he smi.ed at me; I did not tell you just now
that I smiled because 1 knew he was guilty.” But
David didn’t ask many questions. He contented
himself with lolling back in his chair, ana keeping
j fixed upon the witness a look of unutterable con-
tempt. This lice of defence wasperfectly success-
ful. It broke down the witness—and the case, too.
The Boston Herald says that when
" Cuny” Bellew was in America, lately, he was in-
troduced to Perugini, an actor whom he greeted
with much hauteur. In reply to a question,
Cuny said that be had only been once in the
States for a few hours, to which Perugini, riled at
j the other’s manner, replied, hastily: ” What on
earth is the use of telling such stuff as that?
| Wnen you were a boy you and I travelled together
all over this country in the Holman Opera Com-
pany, and old Mrs. Holman used to give yon your
I bath, and spank you, and put you to bed just as
she did tho rest of us. If you would cultivate a
better remembrance of old acquaintances these
embarrassing situations would not arise.” Mr.
Billow flushed and bit his lip, and Perugini turned
on his heel and walked away. This is most pro-
bably a lie, but there is plenty ot evidence that
prosperity has bad its effect upon the histrionic
masher. He is not quite the same sort of man that
he was when he worried round Melbourne to col-
lect those thrilling tales commencing: “ Ye iter-
day a horse attached to a spring-cart,” &o. This
is always the way. If Alfred’s reporters were to
accede to much wealth we don’t believe they
would ever recognise saveloy men or hot-pie pur-
veyors again.
Sir Frederick Leighton, President of the
Royal Academy, has received his baronetcy at the
suggestion ot Lord Salisbury. It was a significant
circumstance that Gladstone passed over the
President when he recommended two Royal
academicians—Mi'lals and Watts—for the distinc-
tion last year. Perhaps the Grand Old Man is not
an admirer of excruciatingly high art; or, maybe,
he disapproved of Sir Frederick’s conduct ii the
notorious Balt business. Belt, it will be remem-
bered, is the sculptor whosa genius is apparent to
everybody except a cartain high-toned clique of
Academicians, of whom Sir F. is high priest. They
look down upon him as a man sprung from the
ranks, unversed in classical lore, and indifferent
to the graceful arrangement of a toga. Backed
up by this aesthetic “push,” an obscure sculptor
named Lawes grossly libelled Belt in his profes-
sional capacity. The Belt v. Lawes action fo].
lowed, and the former obtained a verdict for £5OOO
damages. Then it was that the Leighton division
played their trump card. They had found the
funds for Lawes daring the trial, but when it was
concluded their man declared himself insolvent,
and poor Belt was let infer his own costs-some-
thing like £4OOO without getting a penny of his
verdict. If he was reallv a party to such a scurvy
trick. Sir Frederick Leighton ought to be created

George Augustus Sala perpetrates a most
audacious joke in one of his "Golden Fleece”
Argus articles. Speaking of his limited capacity
for sight-seeing of the “beautiful landscape”
order, G.A writes:—“Providence created some
persons to hold a quart and others only a pint, and
I fear that I am able to contain not an Imperial,
but only a ‘ reputed pint ’ ” What a merry wag it
is! G.A.S. may only contain a pint at each sitting,
but, then—think of how often he sits I By the
way. speaking of the rubicund Sala’s amiable
woakneis for the cup that cheers, we have known
the apostle of Pommery and Heldsieck’s Dry
Monopole slake his patrician thirst with gin. We
remember drinking in his company—that’s to say,
we both stoed in front of the same bar-at an oll-
fashloned London ho-telry. We each ordered
“three of unsweetened,” and we each tendered a
shilling ia payment. Simultaneously we swal-
lowed the poetry-inspiring liquor. From that
point our lines of c induct diverged. Sala, like an
aristocrat, said to the barman, “ D n the chanve
—keep it.” We didn't. Mlnepence was almost ai
much to us, in there days, as-it is now. That
incident, though, inspired us with a feeling of
reverence for tne great man. Tne journalist who
can affoi d shillings for threepenny “ goes ” of gio
and still pay his landlady, must be an industrious
fellow.
Under the heading of “ Christmas Carols ”
a Bourke (N S W.) prner writes:—” The editor of
the 'limes, hke a sanguinary wolf, cm pr cut
behind us with a sword, reeking with sanguinary
gore of other victims, and, raising his blufseor,
attunois to stab to tne hea t with his steel pen,
dipped in poisoned fluid, our little paper. We
smile grimly, and are ready.” SoUsorsl whatsxrt
of Christmas cheer have they in Bourke ?
A prominent Hobart official, well known
for his equally regular attendance at church and
the bar of the nearest pub. congratulated Mr.
Camera on the acquisition of much property In
the city. “ Well,'’ sa'd Mr TC , “ property is a good
investment, is it not?” “ tKiod, yes; but there is
one thing better—heavenly grace is better than
any earthly riches.” And his official superior says
that a conversati >n with him is as good as a u lass
of rum any cold morning.
Why did we forsake Masonry? Just be-
cause no one with a sense of humour could stick
to tne craft. Many a time, in Melbourne, we bar
to he carried home on a door by a couple of sturdy
brethren from the LonsdaK'-street Lodge, No—it

from suppressed lauarhter. At last cur wite inter-

that n> m.eroal organs, however tough, cmld
stand the wear and tear of such constant mirth
without giving way, and that, until we insured
our life, the mad waggery of “Feint 18 ” would
have to be relinquished. All this comes back to
us on reading of the Masonic banquet given to
Lord Carington in Sydney the other night. There
were ladies in the gallery—relatives, no doubt, of
the “majestically tied” men before whose stuh-
born assault beef, poultry, and vegetables wo
becoming mere memories of the past Soma *
the ladies (we quote) gave the “ honours (Peinf i°o,

Upon the Sunday
after the arrival of the
members of the Pedeial
CouasU at Hobart many
of the churches offered
special prayers on their
behalf. At the very time

ists were having “ a good

Ponds above New Nor-
folk, having left Hobart

ot a young man who is
being prayed for by a
number of pious old per-
sons on the ground that,
although he is a very’
wicked young man, he Is
too good for the Devil
to have.” Perhaps the
churches in Tasmania will
continue to offer prayers
■on behalf of Douglas,
Service, Berry, and Co.
on somewhat similar
grounds. The effort is
worth making, though
the chances of success
are somewhat slender. At
any rate, “ pray on,

There has been
trouble in a Tasmanian
country district, where
the local Stipendiary
Magistrate, Coroner,
Chairman of the Court
of General Sessior s, Com-
missioner of the Supreme
Court, Deputy-Registrar
of Births, Deaths, and
Marriages, and the Lord
knows what else, was
summoned to show cause
why he should not be
called upon to support a
certain pledge of physical
affection which his wife’s
maid declared she had
borne to him after certain
complimentary remarks
to the effect that she was
“a pretty girl,” &o. On
the evidence of the de-
fendant and his wife the
esse was dismissed. The
inhabitants of the dis-
trict are evidently of
opinion that there has
been a miscarriage of
justice, for an attempt
has been made to burn
defendants ffflgy, and
liberal subset iptlbns have
been raised tor the girl
who brought the charge
ot seduction against him.
The official is connected
by marriage with a gen-
tleman holding a very
high official position in
Tasmania.
At the Stead sympathy meeting held in
Adelaide recently, the Rev. S. J. Prior owned, in
support'ng the Pall Mall cause, that the charges
made against the “ Maiden Tribute ” could alse be
made against the Bible. Th’s was received wltfr.
deafening yells of “shame” from all the wbite-
chokered fossils present, many of whom evidently
expected the earth to gape and swallow the vile,
blasphemer. When the tumult settled down,,
severalshrivelled-up divines declared that "they'
had felt it their duty to read tte Pall Mall,
Gazette disclosures, but they had done so with,
great pain and shrinking.” Photcs of these
worthy eldera in the act of shrinking ought to selil
well.
The great Australian panacea, the lash,
was administered to two prisoners at Peutridge,
Meih , last week. ‘ They appeared in the flugei-
al^ir.€d in tte new garb that the penal
officials have selected as more comforta le and
warm, says the local Herald. Jc is pleasing to
think that those men have warm, comfortable
togs, although they may not be able to wear them

The following has turned up so often in
,9^^ x ? haDges * that after we have read it 50,000 or
00,000 times more, we will probably begin to get
a trifle interested:- 4 ' J. T. Norris, of Ohio, the
detective does a trick, we are told, that 4 probably
no other man in the world can imitate.’ He takes
a silver coin, usually a dollar, and places it on his
torgue between bis teeth. With his tongue he
strikes it against his teeth with the sound of a
telegraph instrument, the opening and closing of
the circuit being exactly imitated. Norris used
to be an operator, and by means of the coin can
telegraph words so distinctly that any telegrapher
can easily read the message. In this manner he
telegraphed 50 words a minute.—[The last sen-
tence contains a palpable lie, but no matter, avc
read the Noozu occasionally, and can stand it.'!
Mr. Kon is can also stand up before a telephone
and la this novel manner telegraph with his eye-
lids. The dots and dashes of the telegraphic
alphabet he indicates by more or less rapid open-
ing and shutting ot the eyelids. In this manner
he can converse with an exoert without uttering
a sound.” Now that Mr. Norris has had his say,
however, we may observe that {here are
three score men all over Australia who
can do the same thing—in fact, anyone with a good
ear for 44 time” can learn the dollar trick in three
months, es it merely consists in distinguishing the
length of time occupied by the clicks. For in-
stance, the letter A n the Morse code consists of a
dot and a dash. This can be sounded on any musi-
cal instrument by playing a quaver and a crotchet,
and so on through the rest of the alphabet. We
have seen two Sydney men, not detectives either,
do a little item not mentioned[in Norris’ repertoire.
Smith, a telegraphic expert, sat down to play
euchre with Jones, and careiully lost every gams,
until Brown, another lightning-jerker, came in,
and being a 44 mutual” friend, sat down near
Jones to watch the play. After that Smith swept
the pool every time. Brown, having seen Jones’
hand, placed nis toes on Smith's foot, underneath
the table, and by a series of long and short pres,
sures telegraohed Jones’ords to Smith in such a
way as to dtfy detection. In this line we haven’t
much to learn from Ohio* that's certain.

DEBILITATED MEN, and all suffering from
nervous exhaustion, premature decay, etc.,
etc., fully and permanently cured by the use ot
the medicines of the London Medical Company.
For many years those suffering from nervous de-
bility, shattered and debilitated constitutions, loss
of manhood, premature decay, and all the ills aris-
ing from early indiscretions, over indulgences,
over brain work, etc., etc., have sought in vain for
some remedy which would restore them to teat
full vigour and perfect manhood which they nave
been deprived of. Year after year they have
placed themselves under the care of some so-oaliea
specialist, or some great remedy company, ana
niter months of their treatment, involving pounds
of expense, they awake to the sad but true fact
that they are not only no better in health, but tnai
perhaps years of hard earned savings have been
actually thrown away. For the last year or more
still another class of advertisers have come into
the field. Men who claim that they will send pre-
scriptions free to the afflicted public. But what
does the patient receive on sending ? Certainly a
prescription, but one that nobody but the adver-
tiser himself can fill, and for doing which he wants
so much money as the case may be. And this is
his prescription free. Some five years ago several
leading medical men in London knowing tne
imposition's suffered by this class of Patients, ana
understanding the reluctance always felt by tneui
for consulting regular practitioners, deter.mmeu
to form a company and obtain some certain auu
safe cure which they could place before the pun-
lie. With this object in view, three years were
spent in the most careful study, and treatment m
all classes of these diseases all over Europe, ana
from tills vast experience they are now enablea w

A Tragic End.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As In her virtuous couch she’d lain,
The victim had been madly slain
By him, with jealousy Inflamed,
Who, ere he proved, had harshly blamed.
Naught could appease his bitter rage.
Nor could her cries his grief assuage;
She now had learned, alas! too late,
’Tis but a step from love to hate.
The green-eyed monster blinked his eye,
Talked loudly of her perfidy;
Responsive to the monster’s dall,
He Immolated life and all.
When gazing on his fearful Work—
Her fissured breast, the bloody dirk—
What tortures did his heart-strings rack,
What would he give to bring her back ?
♦ ♦ , ♦ ♦
See now upon that awful dtcttffc
He stands, the dupe of his own rage,
Gazed at by all that motley crowd—
Some bow their heads, some curse aloud.
The worn-out murderer longs for rest,
His head is bent upon his breast;
No mercenary coward he—
He killed her all tor jealousy.
The gods looked mutely from above,
With less of anger than of love;
They saw with other eyes, and so
Judged not like those who howled below.
Beside the drop a figure stands,
Grasping the rope between his hands,
Another, with an aspect grave,
Is seen just then his hand to Wave.
The rope is pulled, and all is o’er.
With heavy thud upon the floor,
’Mid shouts and gibes and loud cat-calls,
The act concludes— the drop scene falls.

GAienA Theatre—” Uncle Tom s Cabin »
ALHAMBRA-Miustrelsy, Olio, and Farce.. ..
ACADEMY OE Music—“ Uncle Toms Cabin ~
The version of “ Called Back ” at the
Svdney Theatre Roval disagrees in so many
Particulars with the story 11 seir as to be best en-
P“Sd by those—if any such there be-who’vei not
iead the latter. The general outline of the plot is
there, but many of the details are wanting,'or
their places supplied by others. We are far from
saying that stage requirements do not demand
changes. There they are, at all events,
whether they’re wanted or not, and the reader
who^admired^the dramaticsituatlons. novelstruc-
ture, and felicitous language of the story, is by no
means pleased to observe the changes made in all.
On the stage the blind Vincent Vaughan
and the buxom Pauline March are lovers long
before the murder. This is the first serious falling
nut between the two versions. It may be neces-
sarvand it mayn’t. W hether it is or not, it makes
assassination a poor affair compared
with the literary one. Young March (Mr. Vincent)
is put cosily out of the way by the deft insinua-
tion of Macari’s knife under his fifth rib. It was
ail the lad was fit for, and his decease evoked
neither surprise nor sorrow. You couid see at a
glance that he was in everybody s way, and that
Mfe with such a youth having the run of the house
must end either in a felon’s cell or suimdo s grave.
Had Macari (Mr. Rignold) stopped here he would
have been deserving of praise as a public beneiac-
tor—on© who loved his kind sufficiently fo relieve
it from the presence of a highly-objectionable
voung man. But the unfortunate professipn-
that of a Russian spy—he had chosen, combined
with the fact of his love for Pauline, induced him
to wallow in dissimulation and crime. It is an
odd psychological circumstance that wHen a man
murders another it is often for the Purpose of
marrying that other’s sister. But this method of
courtship is open to serious objections. If a law
could be introduced which allowed a person to
out out of the world without unnecessary violence
the woman whose daughter he was about to marry
we believe that weddings would be much more
common, and human happiness largely increased.
>|! * *
Still, even under the most favourable
circumstances, it is probable that Macari would be
a scoundrel. You see he’s cut out tor one from
the first moment of his appearance. He is a
Russian spy, but his looks suggest that the details
of the Italian organ-grinding business are not
unknown to him—that he is just the sort of person
who would entice young Savoyards to London
and feast them sumptuously on stirrup- oil. He is
a hardened, scandalous villain whom the occupants
of the gallery receive with undisguised vindic-
tiveness. When struggling virtue at last comes to
the surface, and Macari meets a well-deserved
fate, expressions of ferocious satisfaction are
heard on all sides. Whether he was the Macari
that poor Conway conceived is quite another
thing. All we are justified in saying is that Mr.
Rignold has adopted a particular type of ruffian
and carries his idea consistently through to the
end ’ * * ♦
But his voice is unmelodious and occa-
sionally husky. While blind he was madly in love.
Whether his passion kept up to the same pitch
when his eyes were opened, it would be difficult to
say. Judged by appearances, Dr. Ceneri (Mr.
Meade) was about the last person one would sus-
pect of having the cause of Italy at heart. It was
when dying m Siberia that he appeared to best
advantage. The horrors of Asiatic exile, helped
out with the lash, had no effect on the audience.
This is not to be wondered at considering that
every little village in N.S. Wales has its whipping
post. Thuksto our governors, it would require
more than a cat-o’-nine-tails to move a Sydney
crowd to commiseration. Miss Harwood was a
seductive Mary Vaughan whose little tenderness
towards Surgeon Kenyon cast a deep gloom over
several groups of young men in the gallery. Miss
Langueville was the conspirators landlady. The
first look at her showed why her lodgers were con-
spirators. They couldn’t be anything else.
» • *
It was Miss Bishop’s first Sydney appear-
ance, and she has no cause to complain of her
reception. She earned it. She has advantages
natural and acquired. Voice, figure, and face are
in her favour. Being winsome, buxom, and mad,
her success was assured. Long before she re-
covered her senses, half the married men in the
pit looked as if she was the only woman they
ever loved-in spite of her eccentricity-while
their wives glared at her with pitiless cruelty.
But it is not easy to see in her one capable of a
grande passion. Her fianci Vaughan (Mr. Darley)
met the demand of the case so far as height and
figure are concerned.
Mr. Dampier and company are playing
at the Sydney Gaiety Theatre a comedy
which he calls “Uncle Toms Cabin. It is
not the story of American slave life* as told by
Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, though in many of
its situations it is similar. The names of the lead-
ing characters —in fact, of all the characters are
the same as those specified in the story, but the
characters are different. The plot, with one or
two exceptions, is the same. The exceptions are
notably the absence of Gassy (Legree s mistress),
who, in the orthodox presentment of the work,
figures rather prominently. Topsy s songs and
dances are also conspicuous by their absence, and
the cotton-field scene, in which Legree weighs the
baskets, is also unpresented. Little Eva does not
sing the usual, “ Shall poor Uncle Tom be free,
nor is Legree disposed of in the fashion to which
we have been used. Variety is always charming,
and originality is delightful. Lovers of the legi-
timate may now see two * Uncle Tom s Cabins
in this city. Bach differs greatly from the other,
and both differ very much from Mrs. Stowes
story. , *
Sheridan makes the most of the part of
Marks, and has adhered closely to the letter of the
text in the matter of make-up. He forced himself
into the various situations, and gamed the good-
will of the audience from the jump. He haff a
chronic thirst on him, and his liberality when
drinking with his friends was a conspicuous
feature in the performance. He drank often, yet
never paid. He professed great anxiety to be
allowed io shout occasionally, but was more ready
to claim the privilege “next time, next time,
then,” than to part on that present occasion.
Sheridan is a humorist, and his mako-up as Marks
was a proof that he had exercised all his powers ot
funning in costuming his character. He was a
lawyer, a sample of the pcttifoggingfi miserable
animal who, fof a Pint of beer, would swear either
Way, and subsequently both, if necessary. He did
not appear the kind of lawyer from whom a
decant barrister would take a brief. The briefest
thing about him was his coat-tail, and the most
expansive his cheeks# He is the most entertain-
ing item in the bul. and those who have seen
Sheridan in his other entertainment should see
him in this character. .
* * *
Miss Kemble was distressingly natural as
the wife ot George Harris, the fugitive slave, and
throughout made the most of her part. Perhaps
her moat attractive performance is croesiug ihe
“ ice-path of peril,” and thus escaping, for a time,
the persecutions of Legree and his kind y lol-
lowing. There is a Biondlnefmue grace m the
way she skips over the floating ice-floes, whicn
loads fip to the supposition that, as a ground and
lofty tumbler, she would have been a success.
We expected to see her do a tumble when cross-
ing the river-the whole concern looked so very
shaky—but she got over without accident. And
it she had fallen, the stage-oxrpenter was on
the underground regions with’,a hammock, so she
would nor, have been hurt. She carries her child
with her all the time, and though a considerable
Period elapses between the time she leaves borne
and goes on the “wallaby” to Canada, and the
eventuation of the climax, she does not ap-
parently grow weary, nor does the youthful
Harris dirty hla clothes to any noticeable extent.
* ■ *
The Topsy of May Livingstone differs
from any other Topsy we have seen. In her song
and dance, “ Wait till I get my silver slippers, she
leaves out the dance, and if she left out the song
also the item would be perfect. Miss Livingstone
is a young lady blessed with a’ large amount of
self-control. In the last act she comes rushing on
to the scene at the moment when Uncle Tom is
lying dead, and liberates Eliza, scarcely bestowing
a glance on the corpse of the faithful old negro,
and when she shoots Tom Loker on board La
Belle Riviere ” she hops over the bleeding carcase
of the slave-dealer with an agility which would
present greater attractions on a tennis-lawn than
in a theatre.
♦ * •
Mr. Dampier represented George Harris
and was amateurish and heavy throughout the
piece. He played all along as If he was dissatisfied
with the situation, and was unreal and vaguely
conscious of his representative’s feelings. In the
last act he escapes to Canada by crossing a small
footbridge, leaving his boy on the American side.
There was no reason why he should have Jett the
boy, but he did so probably to afford Pnlneas
Fletcher (Harry Leston) a chance of rescuing him
from the hands of Marks by throwing the latter
gentleman over the cliffs into the “ boiling caul-
dron below.” He subsequently thins out the com-
bination by shooting Legree dead and wounding
Dan. Haley (Holloway), after which, folding his
faithful wife to his bosom, he waves his hand to
the corpses; while Phineas, from the opposite
bank of the river, waves the child of George and
Eliza as a trophy of victory. Where Phineas came
from was somewhat of a puzzle—he did not gain the
cliffs la view of the audience, but, bounding up
like a Jack in the Box at the opportune movement,
seized the child and pitched Marks into the atmos-
phere just in time to avert a catastrophe.
* * *
Uncle Tom was personified by O. H. Lewis
(not the Lewis who originally played the character
with the Georgia Minstrels), and he presented the
character of the saintly nigger in such a manner
as not to unduly advance himself to the damage
of the other characters in the piece.
• • ■
Miss Hetty Sherwood’s Eva was an even
and interesting character, and the minor charac-
ters were generally well represented.
m* * «
“A 1 at Lloyds ” did not have a very long
run at the Sydney Opera House, giving place on
Thursday to the “Ticket of Leave Man,” which is to
be succeeded by Dion Boucicault’s “ Janet Pride,’
on Saturday, the 30th. It is probable that pros-
pects at this Theatre will become more joyous
with the presentation of this piece.
•* * *
Uncle Tom continues also to hold his nightly
lev<se at the Sydney Academy, and more people go
to see him than resort to their obliging uncle of
the three gilded spheres after a devastating Derby
or a “ multy ” Metrop., and it goes without say-
ing that I hey derive infinitely more pleasure from
the visit. It is astonishing that a man can posi-
tively gush with goodness, as Uncle Tom does,
although only for two or three hours at a time,
and on the stage. We believe that Mr. Bent is a
most estimable man in private life, but with any-
one else in the character we should view the per-
formance with “ soorprise bordthering upon con-
sternation,” well knowing that a distressing re-
action must follow after such a wholesale
exhibition of high-pressure piety. If a man strolls
around with a holy thumb in a well-worn S.P.G.
Bible for a few hours, a fall from grace usually
ensues which places four aces and a bower in the
apostle’s sleeve and sixteen whiskies in his little
tum-tum, for man on this sinful earth can rarely
attain more than an average amount of goodness.
You never saw a boy coming home from Sunday-
school who had not a keen eye to his neighbour’s
orchard, nor a girl returning from a Dorcas meet-
ing who did not look up to no end of larx, and it is
a well-established fact that the louder a “ Banter ”
parson prays on the Wednesday night the less
sugar does his sand contain for the remainder of
the week. If we had to play Uncle Tom for even
one night in succession, someone’s hen-roost or
apple-yard would inevitably [And, probably,
does now, but this is not criticism.— Ed. B.] But,
as we have already remarked, Mr. Bent is not that
kind of man. We are told that his piety, like red
hair and ugliness, goes right to the bone.
* * *
Eliza manages the escape scene excru-
ciatingly well, imitating the motion which the
swaying ice would engender, waile ever and anon
she rends the welkin with that little agonised
shriek which invariably exudes from lovely woman
when her life is immediately endangered, or she
sees a cockroach. Topsy earns piles of applause,
although all her witticisms are fine, old-crusted
conceits that have been in the wood and bottle
since the comet year. It is a case of semper eadem
with Miss Wiseman and the gags she uses. They
are always fresh and piquant, and she is that way
herself only more so.
It is not likely that the management will
imitate Legree and kill “Uncle Tom” for some
time to come. „ „ „

As a rule, theatrical managers know how
to take care of themselves, but an incident which
occurred at Launceston (Tas.), the other day goes
to show that all forerunners of great men are not
up to ways that are dark. Mr. W. H. Manning
(acting business manager for Mr. W. J. Holloway),
who is making arrangements for opening the
newly-erected Academy of Music at Launceston
had occasion to leave home In search of an hotel.
Asking the nearest way. the person he addressed
offered to show him the road, and the two arrived
in due course. Mr. Manning “shouted,’ and
handing the barmaid half-a-sovereign, left for a
moment to speak to the landlord, who was sitting 1
in the parlour. On his return, he ashed for his
change, and was astounded to learn that his kind
friend had offered to take care of it for him, and
that the barmaid had paid it over. Of course, the
obliging guide bad mizzled, and as no ad. has, yet
appeared in the “ missing friends ” column of the
local print, it may be taken for granted that both
parties have decided to wait until they meet in
the sweet by and bye ” for an explanation of the
‘ mistake.” He was a stranger and they took
him in.

Mr. Alfred Cellier, who makes his first
appearance in an Australian orchestra on the 80th
(as conductor for “Mikado” at the Melbourne
Royal), has a long standing acquaintance with S'r
Arthur Sullivan’s musical methods. Mr. Cellier,
unless we are very much mistaken, wielded the
baton (dear old phrase I) at the Opera Comique
when the “Sorcerer” was originally produced.
* * * *
Minnie Palmer (“ My Sweetheart the
ever-smiling American artiste, is certainly coming
to Australia, although dates have not yet been
absolutely fixed. She still seems determined to
stick to “ My Sweetheart,” the play which was the
means of her first success. Minnie’s personal
charms are of a fascinating order, and she has a
gushingly joyous, light-hearted, impulsive way
with her that has managed to earn a treasury of
wealth for herself and a small fortune for her
manager. Her diamonds are so many and valuable
that it is alleged a Nordenfeldt gun is always
qongealed somewhere in the theatre for her pro-
tection.

George Darrell must look to his laurels.
From tno Melbourne Herald we glean that Mr.
Locke, a member of the “ Barcelona Amateur
Dramatic Club’’ has written something which
“clearly showed that in Melbourne may yet be
found a dramatist who can take rank with Messrs
Sims, Wills, Harman, &c.” Mr. Locke s play has
only been produced at a private performance as
yet, but the Herald correspondent fills us with a
mad longing to see “Kate O’Shane “for ourselves
and judge of its merits. Who Harman is the Lord
only knows; but Sims and Wills are sufficiently
good test horses for any aspiring two-year-old
author. They are both well-tried performers,
who, in dramatic calibre, are as wide apart as the
Poles. If Mr. Locke can take rank with each of
’em (leaving the mysterious Harman out of the
question), why, then George Darrell, as the Aus-
tralian dramatist, is completely annihilated. We
can imagine George turning out something equal
to "Romany Rye,” but we can't imagine nlm
soaring to the height of “Charles 1.,” or "Jane
Shore ’’—except In his dreams.

of course, as far as the action of the face is con-

of course, it is more correct to say, * I heard them
laugh,’ but in this instance I wished to convey the
idea that the ‘ old stranger ’ was actually witness ,

was tossed so high that he waved his hand to the

the Progress Committee of a town in the Macleay

that it was unnecessary to spend the amount—he

The Hobart Mercury, a very solemn
paper Indeed, jokes sometimes by accident. Thus,
in a leader, we read; “In the time of our grand-
fathers, as we need hardly remind our readers,
many offences wbieh are now considered as suffi-
ciently punished with a few years or afew month*
imprisonment, were capital charges.” The italics
are, of course, ours. i'he Mercury s “need hardly
remind our readers,” is simply lovely.
A chart hangs in the Hobart Masonic Hall
representing an imaginary stream with many
tributaries, to show the rise and progress of
Masonry. An old gentleman who had just been
Initiated to the mysterious rites of branding and
goat-riding, gazed admiringly at the picture and
remarked: “Ahl many’s the fish I’ve caugbt out
of that river.” And it took a deal of argument to
convince him that it was not the Thames.
The people of Bathurst, N.8.W., are fast
attaining a literary turn of mind. A member has,
says the 8.F.P., given notice of the following re-
solution :—“ That the Bathurst Sentinel be placed
upon the table of the reading-room of the School
of Arts.” We shan’t be surprised after this to
hear of another literary member bringing forward
another that there be added to the library “ The
Life of Tom and Jerry,” by Mr. Bunions.
A writer in the Sydney D. T. says :
“ Horse-exercise develops some of the best moral
faculties such as boldness, firmness, patience, de-
cision, kindness,” &o. Does it? We thought so
once, until one day a playful brute made us s t
with some emphasis on a stump 10 miles from
home. Before that ride our language would not
be out of place in a Sunday-school Now, it keeps
bullock-drivers agape with admiration and envy.
The Tasmanian Inspector of Fisheries re-
cently imported a coupie of English lobsters for
breeding purposes, at d forwarded them to a suit-
ably quiet spot in the country, with the informa-
tion that he would follow them next day. The
man to whom they were consigned misunderstood
the instructions and carefully boiled tie creatures
in readiness for the inspector’s tea. Details of the
interview that followed have not been made
public.
More snakes. The Candelo (N.S.W.)
Union writesßeware of snakes. One day
last week a child two years of age found in this
office a snake 14in. long, and as deadly as a death-
adder. The child, when discovered, wat dipping
the tall of the reptile in the ink bottle preparatory
to writing a leader on the necessity for Federa-
tion.” The snake was subsequently placed in a
bottle, and—hang it, we think he must have come
out of one first.
The man who runs the Hobart evening
paper is emphatically not a humourist, His
present office used to be a draper’s shop, and over
the door is still to be seen the rag-man's legend—
“ Economy House.” Which reminds us of what
happened in Sydney. The Bank of New Zealand
took over the old premises of the a.M P. Society,
whose motto is “ Amicus certus in re incerta.” But
the bank hasn’t been so foolish as to be a certain
friend tc people in very uncertain things.
I, A N.S.W. country paper says “ The
eldest son of the Coburg tragedy went raving mad
after the funeral of his sister, and has been re-
manded to gaol. The eldest daughter became
very excited, and attempted to tear the bandages
off her wounded arm.” Now, if they would give
us the name of the grandpa of the Warden murder
and the sister-in-law of tne Bulgarian atrocities,
we will feel that it is to the country Press we
must look for definite information on such cases.
The North Shore Times and Manly
Press is a paper with a noble future. It teems
with information for people cf all colours. The
editor speaks in a sad strain of a sale. Hear him:
—“ Nlckle (sic.) plated alarm clocks were sold to
the highest bidder, who apparently intended get-
ting a few cheap lines, 3d. being the amount the
•locks were knocked down for.” We conclude
from this they also had to put a ha’porth of snuff
in the gold snuff-boxes to get the people to carry
them away.
Kiama is jubilant. “ Beach, the champion
oarsman of tne world, has signified his intention
of being present at their Exhibition,” Well, that's
a good thing, now. Beach, by the way, has a
hundred times more of the “agreeable rattle”
about him than he had; and as soon as he has been
inducted into the mysteries of the more choir, he
will be quite the gentleman. Trickett was dis-
tressingly that way, too; and he possessed the
additional accomplishment of always pocketing
his table-napkin.
“ Portions of a swag, together with some
horse-geir and an unlighted fire are reported to
have been found,” &o. Thus writes a Sydney
evening paper.—

’Tis enough to raise one’s ire,
Reading of “unlighted fire;’’
That editor should now aspire
To go where there’s a lighted fire.
At a recent meeting of the Gundagai Hos-
pital Committee, presided over by the venerable
Elworthy. the looa' editor, it was suddenly dis-
covered that 14 out of 79 subscribers had paid up
for the current year. Un the cbalrman deciding
that only these 14 were qualified to vote and take
office, the venerable left the chair with great ex-
pedition, but, after some parley, he was hoisted
Into it again, and adjourned tne meeting for a

dresser’s shop will probably preside on the next
occasion.

A mon’h later. Lady sitting on bench outside
Post-office in the haunted district of Gulllbong,

At Penrith, a man recently got a woman

with the puerile information that “no reason is
assigned for the deed ” If one had been assigned
the chances are that it wouldn't have been correct.
Some girl, or money transa tion, would have been
lugged into the affair. Of course James had his
reason, a good reason for his conduct. w e pre-
sume that pe wanted to cut his thi oat. Ask your
wife why she adopts some line of conduct that
doesn’t suit you. She'll say, “Because 1 do.” If
we could interrogate James at this moment as to
why he cut his throat, he would most Jikely mur-
mur: “ Because I did/’ And he’4 be .just as un-
answerable as the missus is.
There is some talk in Melbourne of the
Victorian State school teachers “striking” be-
cause of the new regulations requiring a higher
standard of knowledge for the same screw. Any
unclean small boy without even the average intel-
ligence, will remark that that is an old game
peculiar to the dominie, and he, the small boy
aforesaid, will caress the fractured bosom of his
pants feelingly the while. Next to the “ holy
Roman ” of Irish parentage the teacher takes the
cakes for persistent agitation against the Vic-
torian Education Act. He is never without a
grievance; in fact, he has been “ raising Cane ” all
alontr the line. There is a little “goak” here—
don't treat it like a stranger.
The fanciful absurdities gone through in
Australian courts of law in endeavouring to get
the bland Mongolian to grip an oath which will
bind his conscience to integrity is exemplified by
the story of a Victorian Judge. A particularly
child-like heathen was to be sworn, but his
theology did not seem to contain a ceremony of a
suitable nature. They tried him all round, be-
headed a moral rooster, and smashed crockery,
but the Ceie tial only grinned, and looked as if he
thought they were “having a lend of him.” Then
they lit a lucifer a» d held it for him to blow. He
surveyed it at first with a puzzled air; then the
li« ht of inspiration Illuminated his countenance,
and, drawing a short black pipe from his pocket,
he lit it at the flame, and remarked that it was
good—“ welly good.”
Fleas afford the legal luminaries in the
Melbourne Supreme Court more trouble than the
most taciturn and melon-headed of witnesses. All
th© bounding ravagers of poor humanity who are
crowded out of the local boarding-houses drive
straight for the Tamp'e of Justice and make their
home there, and when there is acise of pith and
interest they invite their country friends down to
hear the lawyers distribute wild though hoary
jokes. It adds a piquant variety to the usual
court eloquence when the legal gentleman for the
defendant punctuates his oratory by wildly strain-
ing to seize a bloodsucker between his shoulders
and scrape another oil his calf at the same time,
or when his Honor pauses in his summing-up to
scrape his shin-bone with his heel, and squeeze
a—joko ’twixt his thumb-nails.
A very touching display of affection and
gratitude on the part of an elephant occurred the
other day at Melbourne Zoo. An admiring citizen
waited on the bulky quadruped, armed with a
pound of lollies, and when he had fired the con-
fectionery into nis facial aperture that elephant
out of the fullness of his heart seized the man and
aoministered to him a hug, beside whici the
caress of a grizzly or of an affectionate young man
fades into insignificance. When the admiring
citizen got an opportunity he retired from the im-
mediate vicinity, and reposed under a tree. An
interested spectator remarked at the time how the
elephant must have loved him to treat him like
that, but the huggtd one only groaned, and said
“Yes; it was nice for a man to know something
cared for him ” He then asked would he reach the
hospital quicker across the paddocks or round
by the road. Later on a doctor discovered three
fractured ribs and sundry other hurts about his
person. It is a peculiarity of this elephant that he
squeezes till he feels something break. He will be
getting hold of a Melbourne girl one of these
days and straining himself .
The Thargomindah Herald says it was
once in a large mining township with a population
of 3000, whose newspaper only had a circulation of
3001 Wonderful! We knew a mining district
once, the population of which was over 4500, and
whose paper, the Miner, had only a circulation of
59. We were the editor, and we know that if we
took three half-crowns over the counter on pub-
lishing days there was joy la the office. Our
average, unless there was a great rush, was 4s. (id.
We left that journal owing to a leader having ap-
peared in which the Mayor, a brottier-ia-law of
the proprietor's, had been alluded to as a camel.
Having buttoned, on the day of dissolution, our
cheque in the pocket of our moles, we said to the
proprietor: “ Wait here a moment, sir. As we are
leaving, we wish to do ao in an honourable man-
ner.” We then went over to the office and poured
all the long primer and brevier, &c., Into one
pillow slip and rattled all the jobbing plant type
Into another. “ There, sir,” we said to the proprie-
tor; “there ia your type. When the new editor
comes, hand him these bags, and he will know
what to do with them. In the meanwhile, keep
them in a dry place.” Then we saddled up and
made tracks.
It takes Mr. Frank Smith, lessee of certain
Sydney picnic grounds, to set up a true standard
of morality. At the coaclus.on of an alfresco en-
tertainment, the other day, the chairman said,
with pardonable pride, that he couldn’t feel more
puffed up than he did then, even if he had been
living on ginger beer and dried apples for a month.
The picnic was the greatest success ever scored
since the day that Helshazzar gave his birthday
party. Evervone had covered himself with glory,
and Mr. Smith “ had complimented him upon the
manner in which the festivities were conducted,
and remarked that one reason why he could look
upon the picnic with so much pleasure was that,
although there was such a numerous gathering,
he did not once have to call anyone to order for
using bad language.” When next the undertakers’
picnic takes place the facetious Smith will tell his
guests that the reason he considered that day the
proudest one of his life was because he didn’t see
a single corpse lying about during the whole of
the gay proceedings; no one had caved in the head
of a friend with the butt end of a “ pine-liner,” no
one had run away with another man’s wife, no one
had stolen the miniature tram and sold it for old
iron, no one had set fire to his premises, and
brained his cook, and no one had done anything to
excite a suspicion that he was a member of Parlia-
ment in disguise.
Many people will remember Mr. Cottrell,
the talented monologuist, whose clever entertaln-
ment, “ Faces and Fancies,” given in conjunction
with the Carandini Company, were so popular
many years ago, and how, when still in the zenith
of his fame, consumption laid him low. His
widow, formerly Miss Carandini, now contem-
plates marrying again, her choice being Sir Norman
Campbell, a scion of the Argyle family,

An interesting event, viz., a double wed-
ding, took place last Wednesday week at Burwood.
The bridegrooms were Mr. F. M. Mills, of Wood-
stock, Armidale; and Mr. Herbert M. Mills, the
eldest and youngest sons of the late Rev. Mark-
ham Mills, MD„ of Fawkenbam, Kent, England,
and grandson** of the late Archbishop Markham,
of York. The bride of Mr, F. M. Mills was Mrs. Jane
Hill, widow of the late Dr J. J. Hill, of Lambton,-
Newcastle, N.S.W.; the other fair bride being the
accomplished Miss Mary M Harris, second
daughter of the late Mr. William Harris, of
Knocklong, Ireland. The ceremony, which was
graced with musical honours, was performed
ny the incumbent of St. Luke's (the Rev.
Canon Moreton), assisted by a brother of the
bridegroom’s, the Rev. Charles M. Mills. A large
number of guests were present at the church and
at the sumptuous breakfast, which was provided
in Gunsler s best style. The festivities wound up
in the evening with a dance at Klngscote, Bur-
wood, the late residence of both of the brides, the
happy couples having sought the cooler and more
secluded regions of Mount Victoria.

On Wednesday, the 10th instant, Mr.
Charles Cox, only son of the late J. Cox, P.M. of
Forbes (N.S.W.), was married at St. Augustine s to
Miss Lottie, eldest daughter of Alderman Han-
cock, JP„ of Mertonville, Balmain. The bride
wore an exquisitely pure wmte silk gown with
long train, the front of the skirt being embellished
with rich white lace flounces caught up here and
there with orange blossom sprays. A most be-
coming orange blossom wreath encircled the head,
from which fell a long tulle veil embroidered with
white filoselle. The bridesmaids were four in
number —tbe Misses Hancock (3), Miss Stone, and
Miss Pines Two wore pretty coral-pink dresses
and pink wreaths, and two pale blue with elaborate
white lace trimming, and carried magnificent
baskets of flowers. After the ceremony tne party
repair.- d to Mertonville and partook of the wedding
breakfast. Honeymoon—Sandringham.

During the recess of the Lynch Family in
town. Professor Stratham and Mr E. Crome
visited Wollongong, and gave an Organ Recital in
St. Michael’s Church. The church was thronged
in every part, over 400 persons being present—and
what was more, the collection—so the Rev.
Ewing informed the audience, was a remarkably
large one. Possibly the absence of any prayers on
this occasion proved financially beneficial.

Very few smart costumes were to be seen
on the enclosure of Sydney Agricultural Grounds
on Saturday afternoon, upon the occasion of the
Smdan business, Lady Carington’s riding costume
oeing the only fetching article. Her ladyship’s
slight figure looked charming on horseback, and
her habit, which was very strait and short, was
of black cloth, the jacket rounded, and relieved
by white linen collar and cuffs, and just one little
pink rosebud stuck in a button-hole; a tall silk
hat rested on a neat coil of pretty brown
basket plaits, and the gloves worn were of white
undressed kd. Miss Harbord wore cream silk
veiled with lace and a small peaked cream lace
bonnet ornate with a bunch of deep pink rosebuds.
Miss Clara Manning was in pink, with sailor-shaped
hat trimmed with same colour; Miss Young, the
Mayoress, cream broche and lace, cream bonnet
and gloves; her sister, golden-brown satin and
brown straw bonnet touched with pink; Mrs.
Cohen, black broche dress, large white hat
trimmed with black velvet and white feathers;
Mrs. Purves was in a complete costume of a most
trying tint—between crushed strawberry and
faded red; Mrs. Phil. May—one of the beauties on
the ground, by the way—wore a perfectly-fitting
nut-brown satin dress, small round brown turban
hat, with brown feathers; Miss Montague, a
figured delaine, draped over cream canvas
cloth, small white hat bound and trimmed with
peacock blue velvet; Miss Stephens, cream can-
vas cloth touched with ruby velvet, small bonnet
en suite: Mrs. Paget-Biyly, a handsome black
dress and bonnet; Miss Want, black dress and
bonnet, the latter relieved by a sensation of
orange ; Miss Barton, cream veiling dress;
a stylish-looking black canvas costume was worn
by a golden-haired lady, and a cream crepe drees
trimmed with multitudinous loops of very narrow
ribbon, a'l colours of the rainbow, was rather un-
common It may be that the handsome uniforms
of the officers caused the ladies' dresses to pale
almost into significance by comparison* but what-
ever the cause, certes the fair ssx made but a very
ordinary show tor that day at least.

M. Henri Kowalski, the eminent musician
and pianist was entwtainei at dinner by a
number of his friends and admirers at Bau-
mann's, Sydney, on Saturday n>ght last ever
sixty gentlemen, including nearly all the
principal amateu s and musical cognoscenti of
Sydney, sat down to a meal which wai exquisitely
served, and accompanied by wines of admirable
quality specially supplied by Renard anil Co. The
usual speeches were disposed of in less time than
usual, the chairman. Sir Patrick Jennings haying,
however, to exert his authority to prevent the
conventional ‘ olathor” from trenching upon the
time designed to be allotted to music Once
arrived at this stage the evening w»8 passed in
unalloyed pleasure. Mr. Pattk played a violin-
cello solo, a gentleman amateur nerformed a
violin concerto, and M K iwa'sk l , in response
to arient invitations sat down to the piano and
Improvised a pot pqiurf of airs, eich haying a
distinct and different national significance. To-
wards the close of this fantasia, a mas five readii pn
of “God Save the Q icea ’ brought the company to
their feet, to be directly greeted with the noble
strains of the majestic “ Marseillaise ’’—that hymn
of liberty which stirs the hearts of loveys of free-
dom without distinction of nationality. The
company being rS'eatially cosmopolitan, this in-
spiration had tbe happiest reception, The Consul
tor the French Republic, who was present, must
have been gratified by the enthusiasm with which
this air, at once so natlor a! and so universal, was re-
ceived. This terminated the banquet, although a
few choice spirits remained behind some time
longer, indulging in music of a lighter calibre.

A LEGEND OF THE MURRAY.
A CAMP FIRE STORY.
, . . The boy was an old-fashioned little fellow,
intelligent beyond his years; the girl, a toddler,
the idol of his childish heart. He had spoken to
her mother anxiously many times, as if dreading
that this little sister would have to work and fret
through a dull, aimless lifetime; and gathering
from her words that there was a land of rest some-
where near the setting sun, he took her sentences
literally—one afternoon he got the child in the
boat, cut tne painter, and drifted down the
Murray. They were not missed till dark, and, of
course, the supposition was they had fallen in the
river, but the boat being gone convinced the
mother that the boy had left to seek the home of
rest for his baby sister. We found them next
night, the boat had caught in the branches of a
wild apple tree, and the little things lay there
wrapped In the ’possum rug, and resting on a
fragrant couch of wattle blossom. They were
asleep in each other’s arms. It was that sleep
which knows no awakening:
The Btohy.
My mother, your life seemeth dull and dreary,
Is never rest for the worn and weary ?
Will my sister, sweet, have this ceaseless sorrow,

Skatches at the Kowalski Banquet.
To sob to-day and be Sad to-morrow ?
Is there no place where the troubled breast
Is calmed in a region of peace and rest ?
“Yesl beyond the realm of the sunset golden,
Over the hills and the valleys olden,
Paraway from this world of tears and laughter*
In the distant land of the great Hereafter;
Beyond the gates of the golden west,
My child, is a region of endless rest.”
‘‘See, the light on the waters beameth brightly.
Where tinted clouds o’er the stream float lightly*
Where the crimson and gold in the azure blending*
And the sinking sun shows the day is ending.
My sister, there, is the bright land blest,
The peaceful region of endless rest.”
“ The region where sorrow and woe come never*
Of play.ime and love, and peace for ever.
Let us launch the boat on the fern-banked river
And sail where the western sunbeams quiver;
Each weary soul is a welcome guest
Who reaches the region of endless rest.
Let us seek, we two, for that land celestial.
And bid farewell to this world terrestrial.”
He fashioned a couch of the wattle’s blossom*
Wrapped her warm with skins of the gray
opossum.
Then launched the skiff from her ferny nest.
And pointed her how to the golden west.
Soon the Murray, with murmuring lullaby.
With its sobbing song, closed each weary eye?
Lre the sun dipped twice through the western
portal
I hey passed to the home of souls Immortal,
And seraph-borne to the mansions blest,
Vwaked in the regions of endless rest.
The Pilgrimage.
For many a year we wander over hill and dale and
mountain,
Yet for ever pressing onward till we’re weary,
worn, and old,
Searching for some spot elysian, where the poets’
crystal fountain
Sings its song of calm contentment In a valley
draped with gold.
Where the flowers bloom for ever Injthe sun’s life-
giving kisses,
But never drooped ’neath thirsty skies nor felt
the winter’s chill;
Where smiling roses wreath no arbor where the
adder hisses.
And the future of our youthful dreams our later
days fulfil.
Then the purple tinge of morning thrilled our
careless hearts with pleasure,
And the sunbeams shooting downward with our
spirit shared their glow;
Then every bell and buttercup that blossomed was
a treasure
In those days that we have dreamt of in the
misty long ago.
The ropes of Sand that bound ua then appeared so
deftly woven
That we noticed not each single grain the breezes
swept away,
Nor underneath the robe of beauty, silken-cased,
the cloven . , , ,
Hoof of Time that twined the garlands but to
gloat o’er their decay.
But Joys of life would pall upon the heaft If they
for ever
Unbroken by a shadow shone in one eternal
glare.
And the bonds of love are strengthened in the
thought that they may sever,
And are hallowed in the memory of lives and
loves that were.

'At Hergott (8. A.), a blackfellow went out
shooting and hurst his gun, shattering his hand.
Then, instead of tying up his wound, or going for
assistance, he set to work to hunt up the pieces of
that gun. The Hergott correspondent of the S. A.
Advertiser says there were just 43 pieces, and
the black found “all, but one.”
Preaching recently at Cairns (N". Q.)’
Bishop Stanton said that praying for rain out
West was to expect a stupendous and gigantic
miracle. After referring to the geographical
position of the country, he pointed out that it was
against the natural possibilities to expect rain
there, and to pray for it was absurd, as the thing
was simply a gigantic impossibility. And as the
harmonium struck up the soul-inspiring strains of
“The Lord will provide,” the congregation paid
their threepences and filed out, with sorrow and
disappointment in their hearts.
Mr. Charles Henry Stebbins, who for some
years has waxed fat and kicked a deal on the pro-
ceeds of £8 cheques altered by him in value to
£BO, evidently hasn’t a very high opinion of the
N.B.W. police, for in writing to a Sydney friend
he said he intended soon to visit the city of the
Beautiful Harbour, make £SOO In a week or two,
and, like the hard-worked bishops, take a trip to
Europe. Charles Henry has now made up his
mind to stay in Australia a while longer.
A N.S.W. country paper says the best way
to kill a snake is to seize it firmly by the tall, and
then, drawing it quickly to you, crack it as you
would a stockwhip. In this way every joint in its
body will be broken, and if firmly held it is as
harmless as a stockwhip cracked in like manner.
Well, we have tried both, and would almost as
soon crack the snake as the whip. The latter is
dangerous enough, not only to the operator, but
to the neighbouring population. We essayed to
crack a 30-ft. whip once, and were extricated from
the coils just before we were strangled. After
reading the snake-cracking paragraph we
tried it, and, catching one about 4ft. long
by the tall, we gave him a shake, and he im-
mediately commenced spitting fire and brimstone,
and wasn’t disjointed worth a bronze penny.
We at once climbed a tree, and watched him till
he crawled into a hole in the ground, after which
we climbed down and started to find the writer of
the par. We have not found him yet, but the
sight of the old familiar story brings hope to our
aching heart. When we sight the man we will
fetch along the snake, and, at the crowbar’s point,
compel him to crack it. If he does, he will live;
if not, the bar will do its duty.
Here is an interesting par on the question
of woman’s alleged inferiority to man:-“If we
were asked what is to-day the great advantage
which man has over woman in the struggle for
existence, we should answer, without hesitation,
pockets. Pockets are the symbol of an orderly
mind, of logical powers, practical acquirements,
homogeneity. A bag—a woman’s bag, a shopping
bag—is the emblem of the Kingdom of misrule.
Tne fact that he has conquered his pockets, so to
speak, testifies to the supremacy of man. If his
tailor demurred at putting them in, that useful
minion would find his occupation gone. But when
woman is told by her dressmaker that only one in-
accessible pocket is to be allowed her she supinely
submits and thereby proclaims her inferiority of
sex.” We won t try to add anything to this. It Is
too apparent, too solemn, and too true to re-
quire any comment.
The forthcoming Victorian elections are
agitating snobocracy to a painful degree. A puny
Melbourne “ weekly ’ (and it is weakly), which has
no raison d'etre except to lickspittle Lady Loch,
and drivel about the “social world,” can hardly
find words to express its contempt for certain of
the Parliamentary candidates. Thus discourses the
twaddler-in-chief of this periodical—” I was very
much amused the other day in glancing over the
list of names of candidates for seats in the new
Parliament. I And, for Instance, that a former
lumper at the Sugar Works is aspiring to represent
Footsoray.” The natural snobblsm of this tea-
party chronicler revolts at the thought of any
level-headed working man entering the lists
aarainst softer-handed competitors. But' here is a
special reason why this presuming lumper—Mr.
P. M. Salmon—should be abhorred in the sight of a
“society” beslaverer. Mr. Salmon is the thrice-
dyed villain-the reckless revolutionary caitiff-
who protested against the purchase of a summer
residence for Sir Henry Loch He described that
transaction "S a “job”; had the audacity to say
that if Sir Henry wasn't satisfied with the same
quarters as his predecessors it were better that he
should find a summer residence in some other
colony. Now, a sturdy Democrat who ticks off Sir
Henry L ich and his lady in such a rough and
ready style is something to be shuddered at by
journalists who devote their greasy quills to the
apotheosis of the powers that be. This Mr.
Salmon’s crime consists leas in being an ex-lumper
than in not being a snob.
At a recent meeting of the Sydney City
Council, Alderman Playfair said he was one of
those who voted for the dismissal of Mr. Sapsford,
the City Architect, over the Illegal expenditure of
£7OOO, but, as Mr. Sapsford had a wife and family
depending on him, he would now vote for his
reinstatement. Alderman J. D. Young thought
that If this plan of reasoning was followed up a
man with two wives would have still further
claims on their consideration, whilst a Mormon
would be entitled to exercise greater power than
the Mayor and Corporation. We think that, in
course of time, our weakly dailies will treat us to
an occasional car. in this style:—“More Police
Intolerance.—Numerous complaints having been
made of to the Postmaster-General respecting
the non-deli Very of letters containing money, a
detective was employed to secrete himself, and
keep the Post-Office c erks under surveilanoe. On
Tuesday morning one of the letter-carriers was
observed to thrust two letters up his sleeve, and
then start off on his rounds. The detective
at once followed, arrested the man in George-
street, found the letters, containing £lO each In
his pockets, and was about to escort his prisoner
to toe Central, when the latter, shaking him off
indignantly, exclaimed 4 Unhand me. villain!

mentioned. ‘What name? enquired the officer.
•Timothy Filchitt,’ replied the insulted party,
‘What family? ‘ One wife and 14 children. All

‘ and i tr'St you will not take any further notica

being a single mm, I’m liable to 10 years im-
prisonment.’ ‘Very well,' replied tne kmd-
hearted postman, as he walked off, but never let
it occur again.’ ” [Things have come to a pretty
pass, indeed, when a respectable man, with such a
family as Mr. Filchitt has, should be subjected to
such an indignity as this. We demand a searching
enquiry at the hands of the Minister for Justice.

How to put down crime is a problem
which need vex society no longer. A panacea to
euro all wickedness has been discovered by a gen-
tleman concealing his virtuous identity from the
world under the initials “ J. NHis remedy, like
all truly great ideas, is simplicity itself. We quote
from “ J.N.’s ” letter to the Melbourne Hebald:
—“By report in the papers I see the prisons and
gaols of the colony are filled with criminals, and
no prospect of crime diminishing. I would re-
mark that as the Federal Council is now sitting,
one of the council should suggest the idea of
forming a Federal penal settlement in New
Guinea, where the worst class of criminals
could be sent. The climate there is very
unhealthy, and if criminals were sure of
being sent]it .would be a great preventive of
heavy crimes. It is of no use to talk of human
feeling—[evidently I Eu. B.]—when dealing with
those that in many Instances are worse than brute
beasts. If they knew they would be banished to
a country where fever is sure to prostrate them,
I am certain crimes now committed would be few
and far between.” “J. N.,” who gloats ever that
word “criminals,” with all the unotuousness of a
parson, has our warmest approval of his scheme.
The notorious Mr. Howard, who devoted a life-
time to the task of ameliorating the condition of
gaol inmates, was a well-meaning but misguided
man. To preserve criminals—with a big, big C—
is to preserve crime. Dread of a journey to New
Guinea may not prevent bad men from doing bad
deeds as heretofore. But the climate will kill ’em
when they get there. Come hither J.N., and join
us in carolling :
What’s the Mayor going to do. The eye
of the nation Is upon him, and people are expect-
ant. No more hunks of beef carried on wheels,
we hope. That didn’t teach us anything. That
was to be seen 13 years ago at Simpson’s, in the
Strand. This luncheon was the only feed at which
we really missed our old friend the banquet duck.
We, however, lunched cheerily enough upon a
plate of sponge cakes, and a bottle of extremely
old medicine we mean madeira; while a young
lady next us, who appeared to develop a superior
amount of collar-bone, first eat Biunderbore’s
dinner off the joint, and then discussed her own
little luncheon of boiled mutton and capers, with
the turnips well laid on! When the thing was in
full swing, that rubicund butcher, ex-Mayor Play-
fair turned, with a groan, to Alderman Meets.
“Meeks,” said he, in a low voice, “I should
never have dared to do this.” “Why?” en-
quired the other, “Because,” he said, hoarsely,
“ they’d have said I’d been taking stock; and that
these were the first of the alarming sacrifices.”

It is stated that the Prince of Wales re-
cently won at a gaming-house on the
Continent, The Queen is deeply pained at the
news, fearing he may contract gambling habits,
and—a change of luck:-
Good Wales, speech fails
To tell the pain we feel;
Great Scott, ’twas hot,
Your luck, who had the deal 1
To game is shame.
Your friends you will estrange.
The Queen, ’tls seen,
Dreads much your luck may change.
But still, we will
Not grumble at you, Al
And if you’re “ stiff ”
At any time, old pal,
Three cards, two “ pards.,”
A gin-case on the course,
A pug., a “ mug,”
And there you are, old horse.

The Ten terfield Stab, in humorously re-
viewing tne troubles of a school-teacher, quotes
the following paragraph from a N.Z. school in-
pectoi’s report:—“The teacher is at present
living in a hut in the immediate vicinity of the
school. The hut was purchased by him for £1,
and he has expended on it the sum of £3 10a. in
procuring tongued and grooved timber for lining.
The necessary labour was performed by himself.
He had also made a very good swing for the chil-
dren, and an easel for the school. As he has
shown a disposition to make the best of thq cir-
cumstances, I beg to recommend that the com-
missioners refund the sum of £3 10s. expended by
him on the hut. If a new school is built, the hut
will be handy as a fowlhouse.” Brother Filler,
listen while we sing—
Hard by the present school-house stands a humpy,
old and mean,
Which, in its sere and yellow leaf, knows not the
living green;
Through cracks between its sheets of bark crawls
in the summer snake,
The glad gohanna, and such things, to keep the
“ school” awake;
The ’possum leaves his cosy nest and climbs adown
the tree,
To interview the master and obtain the rule of
three;
The bandicoot, right through the house, will lead
the porcupine,
To learn, beyond uncertainty, that three times
three are nine;
While from the sand, which floors the hut, the
lively little flea
Hops o'er the teacher’s snow-decked scalp, and
learns the verb “ to be ”;
The wombat leads the moa’s ghost to wake him
from his dream,
And ask the teacher for the seuree of Old Thames’
limpid stream.
Dull children learn “ the rudiments ” through all
the weary day.
And one by one, before “the board,” their little
lessons say—
While he, the happy teacher there, the wisest*
best of men,
Lives in a place, just Jit for fowls, which cost him
three pounds ten.

For 12 years Carcoar Mary has entreated
those who do not get their paper regularly to com-
municate with the office; and it is a curious fact
that while she has never heard from a solitary

very frequently been communicated with by
people who did.

From the Evening News;— “If Henry-
Blank does not return to me within one
month from this date I Intend to get married
again. (Signed) Mary Blank.”—
Think of the time, dear Mary, when
He was the sweetest of all men;
How your heart jumped—glowed every sense
When you both met at Jones’s fence I
“ You’re just the girl for me,” he said;
“ You’re just the boy for me,” you blurt;
And then you cry, and hide your head
Upon your lover’s crimson shire.
Pause, Mary, pause; now, have a care,
We know all this ’causa we were there!
At supper-time that you should seek
To do us thus a cruel wrong I
Our coffee was so parlous weak,
And his was always brandy-strong I
And now—well, you take our advice,
And happy yet will be your lot—
The “ ad.” will fetch him in a trice,
J ust wait and see first what he's aot.

The Rev. Dowie has broken out in per-
spiration over the Bishop of Melbourne’s unfor-
tunate assurance that he would never, never,
never accept another appointment. Indignant
Dowie says the Bishop goes home “with a lie in
bis hands to get £4000 a year. A true Disciple of
Christ would not leave one place where he was
receiving £1000 a year for another place where he
would get £40C0 a year.” PheughI The aggres-
sive faith he aler is somewhat coarse. The Bul-
letin touched upon this matter in a more deli-
cate way. We merely insinuated that Dr". Moor-
house leaves us with an indiscreet speech on his
tongue. We have forgiven him. On that blissful
day when Dowie leaves us—ah, when I—well for -
get and forgive all Ms little indiscretions. As re-
gards the possible conduct of true disciples, we
must leave Dowie to hold his own opinion. We
have never run across one ourselves. The proba-
bility is that they have gone the way of the dodo
and the mastodon. Let’us expostulate with Dowie.
Not that he will heed. We have expostulated too
often:—
At Dubbo recently, Dr. Gay captured a
burglar in his house at night. When the miscreant
was pinned, the following dialogue took place:—
DOC : “ You dog, I’ve got you I” Bua.: “Oh
pardonney moi, m’sieu—laissez-moi fuir.” Doc!
(in French): “Yous alltz burgley mon maison.”
Bur. (piteously): “II me trompais—” Doc.:
“Trumpery, is it; that settles it. Come to the
lock up.” From one of the local
papers a few days later:—“ The prisoner was then
sentenced to six months’ hard labour, the P.M.
gracefully complimenting the doctor upon his
proficiency in the Gallic tongue.”

We see that the Victorians are going to
question Brett's claims as an amateur, he having
been elected one of the N.S.W. four. However,
lot Brett bear up (he is not very likely, by the
way, to be much disconcerted I), and listen to the
following:—In a crowded room a great military
man was dieorodltod when he made a certain
statement as to his exploits. “PoohI” said one,
“ aide-de-oamp to Prince Durham I—why, there’s
no Prince DurhamJ” (Laughter) “No, no,
General; we can forgive a good deal, you know,”
cried a second; but Prince Durham is a leetle too
much.” Mixed chorus: “Now, you must own it
yourself, General—far too much; amusing enough, j
but—.” Here the great military man rose to his
feet, and placing down a card in the centre of the
table, said, In a quiet voice, “ Prepare yourselves,
gentleman. You will have to fight that party to
morrow. Then he stalked calmly but. Immedi-
ately the G.M.M. had taken his departure, a rush
was made for the card. A moment afterwards a
hollow groan resounded through the assemblage.
Here is the card’s fac simile:—
Le General Mark Guivehre,
Aiae-de-camp diplomatique,
De bod altesae impdriale,
Le Prince Jerome.
—Palais Boy ale.
So, you see, Brett, old fellow, there are others
doubted besides you. And think of the blood that
will flow 1 But you can afford to keep quiet. No-
body has any doubts about your bona tides as an
amateur really. No one, Indeed.

“The steamer despatched by the pro-
prietor of the Auckland Stab to search for the
new island, or stranded ship, or whatever it was
that the captain of the Herald saw off Cape Van
Dieman, has returned, and the crew give it as
their opinion that the object was a stranded whale
harpooned by some Mao ries a fortnight ago. They
could not find either ship, whale, or island them-
selves.” . . . The Reverend S. Macfarlane, one
of the South Sea Island saints who guide the un-
sophisticated nigger to salvation or elsewhere, by
means of the “ Oil Religion,” stated last week in
the Pitt-st. ( Sydney) Congregational Church, that
"he had purchased the island off New Guinea, on
which he has established a central mission station,
for 3i. 63. worth of hoon-iron.” And he also said
that the wages he paid to natives for clearing
ground on the island were six inches of hoop-iron
per man per day
A supernal glow suffused the breasts of holy men
and women.
When the captain of .the Herald and his five
veracious seamen
Told the world they found an island off the coast
of Cape Van Diemen.
Hands were rubbed against side-pockets and pale
faces dry and weary
Cracked and split in queer contortions with the
effort to be cheery,
But the wriggling convolutions all in all were
ghastly dreary.
’Tis a fact that in the South Seas there is scarce an
island standing
But has had the sacred-tidings trick played on it,
preachers landing
Precious hauls of goods and chattels. Why, the
other night commanding
Rapt attention, the Macfarlane told the Sydney
people how he,
Robed in grace, stalked through New Guinea, as
the apostolic Dowie
Docs the vas along North Melbourne; and his
hearers must allow he
Knocked those natives with a vengeance. Why,
Voltaire, Rousseau, or Byron
Never made the faiths look grimmer that poor
human lives environ
Than did this barefaced apostle with his cargo of
hoop-iron I
There was little use in others going northward, so
this dryland,
Which the captain of the Herald found, looked
like a smiling island
For fresh missionary enterprise dropped from the
azure sky land.
And the languishing apostles packed their trunks
with threads and laces,
With red ribbons and green beads to shake before
the wond’ring faces,
And resolved each one immediately to grab the
likely places.
But, alas I the news came after that the Island off
Van Diemen
Was a skeleton exaggerated by the silly seamen—
Which has stopped the frantic facial work of these
good men and women.

At St. Peter’s Cathedral,'Armidale, Mr.
W. E. Hart was recently married to Miss Oliver.
With the peal of the joy bells still in our ears we
can call upon the muse to wish the young couple
the fullest felicity
Friend Hart, we wish you every joy,
May Hymen’s bonds be silken fetters,
May trouble from your path deploy,
And every post bring monied letters;
And paddling in your own canoe
Adown life’s calmly flowing river,
She'll murmur, “ Oh, fond Hart, be true,”
And you’ll reply, ‘ I am O-liver.”

Poor Batt. is crushed again, just as he
thought he was going to enjoy himself. He went
out hunting with the Guards’ dragnounds (sic),
and was taken home in the silent eve on a shutter-
Her Majesty, when the Prince had sufficiently re-
covered from the “cropper” to present himself
before her, told him that he must regard his hunt-
ing days as over. " Oh, not altogether, mal ” en-
treated the Princess Beatrice. " Madame, ze hunt
hi adore!” exclaimed her husband. "Oh, well,
it’s of no use, children,” returned the Queen pet-
tishly, “ I have made up my mind. We are not a
hunting family. The Prince Consort did not hunt.
Twice I permitted him to indulge in the pleasures
of the stag-chase. On each occasion poor Albert
started on horseback—on each occasion he was
brought home by rail. The second time, ho agreed
with me, that we were not a hunting family.
Bertie, you know,” continued Her Majesty,
who appeared to have got the hang of her
subject, “ rarely huzts, and when he does
he by no means scores a success. I have even
heard that when hunting, bis suite have nick,
named him' the ‘ bolster.’ Grossly impertinent,
of course, but there’s the fact. And your hunting*
too, Henry, has been very expensive. Fou never
go out but you lose some portion of, or some orna-
ment to, your dress. Fifteen boys have brought
home 13 different buttons from that German
uniform thing of yours. And Lady Lulliold re-
ports having had to reward each boy with a
shilling—until I declare, really,” cried Her Majesty,
much agitated, and breaking off at a tangent,
“ that what with a shilling here and a shilling
i there, I really hardly know—” Her Majesty was
here interrupted by the entrance of the Lord
Chamberlain, who announced the immediate
appearance of the Kail. At this moment the
Queen’s private band struck up the well-known
air (well known at Balmoral), “To the Haggis Jet
us Gang.” It is a song, by-the-way, of which the
first verse runs as follows:
“ To the Haggis, let us gang,
Eh, to cooltie con ye sen,
May ye nookit noose lang.
Avan gooloch an ye ken.
To the Haggle,” etc.
During the honeymoon, however, Princess Bee, by
way of perfecting Prince Henry’s education,
taught him the concluding stanza of the weird
lyric, which is to be sung with one foot on the
table, waving your claymore the while. Here you
are:—
“ Roieh be naft mine Collie, dear,
Druma voltch a bonnee sang;
Ordan room wl bannocks near
To the Haggis let us gang.
To the,” etc.
We have too deep a sense of what is due to
Royalty to further intrude upon Her Majesty’s
privacy.

The Hon. John Carr said at the Wesleyan
Conference in Adelaide that the Coburg tragedy
was distinctly traceable to the Pall Mall
Gazette’s “ Malden Tribute to Modern Babylon.”
Not so, Mr. Carr. The Gazette's article had just
as much to do with this as your speech had to do
with the abolition of the totallsator, A word with
you:—
So, Honest John,
You gaze upon
That article as having stamped on
Those maiden brows
(Your speech allows)
The brand of Cain for Mesdames Hampton,
But say not so,
For, Carr, we know
(At least the daily papers say it),
The girls were mad,
And so they had
Removed the child to calmly slay it.
No cause assigned
The vacant mind
Secured a reason prompt and Stead-y.
Blamed the Gazette,
But people yet
Think they were mighty mad already.
Now, John, attend,
We say, old friend,
You’ve struck (you understand) a “ blizzard.”
Just keep you dark,
Or some mad spark
May come some night and slit your gizzard.
Jubilate.
Good bye to evil-doing,
A long farewell to crime ;
A social scheme is brewing
Which seenn to us sublime.
For a heaven- born invention
To abolish naughty men,
What need is there to mention
We have to thank J. N.?
The man who robs his neighbour,
Or frequently gets “ tight,”
Has hitherto done “ labour
And people thought that right I
But a genius has arisen
Who tells us, in a word.
That sending “ lags ” to prison
Is really too absurd.
He offers a suggestion—
It knocks us over quite—
Which puts the social question
In quite another light;
At present, says this party,
We put our rogues in gaols
And keep them hale and hearty—
That’s where our system fails.
The purport of the letter
Of Christianlike J. N.,
Is—” Surely ’twould be better
To send away such men—
The forger, goods-recelver.
Or larrikin—from hence,
To where they’d die of fever.”
(Now isn’t that Immense !)
The region round Fly Kiver
Can now be turned to use—
With any robber’s Jiver
’Twould play the very deuce ;
The climate is unhealthy,
(Poor Soratchley died, we know)
And fever, slow and stealthy,
Would lay the robber low.
Thus crimes would soon diminish—
They’d dwindle bit by bit—
For that climate warm would finish
The chaps who crimes commit.
A scheme with so much in it,
Fair trial we ought to give—
Let’s send J. N. this minute,
And see how long he’ll live.
An Extinct Race.
There may be priests who give no thought
To trifles such as “ screw,” sir;
But study of the cloth has taught
Us they, indeed, are few, sir.
Where does a “ true Disciple ” hide—
W ere can a fellow find him ?
We fear the last true D. has died
And left this tale behind him.
E en if there lived some curate meek,
Who once refused a rise, sir-
No bishop could have been so weak,
So bashful, so unwise, sir;
They only gain such high reward
Who make it here their mission
To preach the gospel of the Lord
Prom a feather-bed position.

Which seek far less to follow Him than dower

Rebuild in dreams the haughty strength of Boms;
Nor note how every sjstem has its day—
Rises and glows awhile, and fades away;
Who claim to be the true interpreters
Of one sure Faith, which never shifts or errs.
And pent in solemn solitudes,—remote
From the true lives of men, hear some sweet note
Of Nature s voice of Change—some hint discern.
But stop their ears, and will not heed or learn.

To battered idols of the days that were,
Gray remnants of some cold and lampless shrine,
As to the ruin clings the feeding vine;
Who, next to God, assume supreme control
As His appointed stewards of the soul,
Yet manage, 'mid the press of ho!y cares,
To keep one eye on temporal affairs;
Who, scorning gold, yet wrest it from the poor
To gild a V.rgin—or adorn a door,
And preaching “ Money fathers many ills,”
Leave the curst thing to others—in their wills.

Well versed ia all the ways of sophistry.

Laborious curates, to sustain whose lives
Their scant emolument but scares contrives—
Who hold in Llfe'sgame each an ace of spades;
Loved by the richer class of antique maid 9.
Courted by matrons, smiled on in the street
By fair “communicants,” divinely sweet,
Fawned on by bulky merchants,—to be brief,
Respectable and good beyond belief;
Who dwell in palaces, and rest their heads
(Unlike the Son of Man) on feather beds,
Who, having each his little Bank account,
Blush not to read the Sarmoa on the Mount!
On business principles attend their fold.
Not as the first Disciples did of old,
And out of Satan take full many a fall
On—well, raoreEQUAt, terms than could Saint Paul.
Do unctuous Wesleyans, with shiny hair,
All round us congregate in angry prayer.
That all their brethren—Wesleyan lambs alone—
Receive acceptance at the Great White Throne ?
Exultant Chadbands, who, with upturned eyes,
Hand over to the worm that never dies
All Unbelievers, having naught to choose
Save Hell's eternal flames, or—Wesley’s views;
Or strident members lay, who sweat and groan,
And give God's words a rather nasal tone.
Converted greengrocer’, who now entreat
For Grace, as erst for buyers in the street;
“Awakeaed ” burglars— very much awake,
Who gave their “jimmies” up for Heaven’s sake.
Who having picked all other looks, despair
Of picking Heaven’s, save by Wesley’s prayer;
God-fearing storekeepers who bow the knee
To God, and sell His creatures spurious tea,
Their Sabbath boliowings the conscience price
Of a week’s profit upon shameful rice.
Here we will take the liberty, for once,
To quote some bitter verse of Tennyson's—
Keen, acid lines which very clearly tell
The poet knew the Methodist full well:—
“ With all his conscience and one eye askew,
So false, he partly cook himself tor true,
Whose pious fraud, when most his heart was dry.
Made wet the crafty crowsfoot round his eye,
Wno, never naming God except for gain,
So never took that'usefui name in vain;
Made Him his catspaw, and the Cross his tool,
And Christ the bait to trap his dupe and fool—
Nor deeds of gift, but gifts of grace he forged,
A”d, snake-like, slimed his victim ere he gorged;
And oft at Bible meetings, o’er the rest
Arising, did his holy, oily best,
Dropping the too rough H in hell or heaven, I
To spread the Word by which himself had thriven,*’ j
Do Presbyterians, ever on the watch
Some erring brother of the cloth to catch,
In sounding Synods, met to spread the grace,
Ape many of the worldly feats of Mace;
Where each his neighbour-shepherds’ failings
paints
In words unknown to gentlemen or saints,
Declares each other pastor's worship is
A lower brand of holiness than ins,
Denies his godliness, gives him the lie,
Or even “ peels ” and belts him in the eye ?
Lean, leathern Calvins of a later day,
Who seem to curse the things for which they pray,
Who cry to all the world, “ O blindfold fools! ’
And seek to do God's work with Satan's tools;
D aur sullen bigots at whose tones depart
All light and j ayaunce from the human heart,
Who, seeing flowers ablow anl Jambs at play.
And chi drea romping on the Sabbath Day,
BPo their stern Sips and turn their eyes away—
Who, if the Lord were Scotch and bear! their
prayers,
Would have the world a place of tear? and tares.
Not seeking to bring Heaven for us below,
But trying how a touch of Hell would go.
Do sordid hypocrites and ribald rogues
Call Afferent wares from differing synogogues,
Proclaim the shortest cuts to Heaven anl tell
•The latest ,l wrinkles ”in avcilirg Htl;
Like rival bookmakers, who, hot and hoarse.
Give you your choice upon the Randwiek course,
Who do His wcrk and hump their cn sses round
For Love ? No—for so much a week and found,
Day-work aposllis of obtcure sub-creeds;
Martyrs of tea-fights end alfresco feeds,
Of vest digestion, of appearance smooth,
Who “travel on the game” and spread Terewth;
Discordant swarms of sombre birds of prey,
Who well m’ght fright the Evil One away
With anti-devilisms, that disagree
In all, save brotherly inharmony.
Thy voice, Mnsophiles, at once uplift,
Warn us of Modern Thought’s injurious drift,
In quavering couplets tell the doleful tale
Of how Agnosiics make themselves a Baal
To kneel in worship to—not to the skies,
But to all Nature lift adoring eyes;
Warn Christians that ai one they must Unite
And, strong in faith, fight out tbe good y fight,
Combat FrCethought which openly derides
Sura guidance and declines to pay sure guides;
Deplore the impiousness, no longer mute,
That dares men’s direst sorrows to impute—
Not as the churches, in their palmier days.
Directed—to the Lord's mysterious ways—
But to men’s selfishness, which dares to hold
That all these churches in the days of old
Were fetters forged by cunring artisans
To bind the sturdy limbs of ignorance.
Which thinks (and says so loudly, which is worse)
That priestcraft has been mar kind's darkest curse,
A maze of mystic rites snd sorceries
Designed to bring the people to their knees;
Call on the world with this c'retd thing to cope
That seeks to undermine man’s fairest hope.
Cry out in woe, “ Irreparable loss
If Atheist hatchets should hew down the Cross,”
Sound all the scale of platitude and cant,
Be now a P«pist now a Protestant.
It matters nothing—have your platform broad
Affirm all creeds bow down before one God;
Say ttis with fervour, nor by inward laugh
Hint that the god may be the Golden Calf;
Show that Revea’ed Religion leads the van
In all high schemes for eleva'.icg man,
And over has done so, and then contrast
The holler present with the hardened past;
Of all the virtues show the fair increase
In modern London over ancient Greece;
Attiibute all things that are wise or good
Or glorious to the Caurch’s fatherhood,
And to the scoffing scientist who pries
Through Nature’s workshops with observing eyes,
The sneering sceptic who will net believe
The Serpent ever said a word to Eve,
Who, blind to his own utter wormbood—vain
Of his own knowledge labours to explain—
As natural effects or “ put-up ” sells—
The Church’s veiy latest mirae’es.
Who, bare-headed to Nature, stands and “guys,”
With hat undoffed, the Church’s Mysteries,
And, with a smile on his sardonic face.
Reduces them to a commercial base.
Be wholly merciless-la words that bite
Assail each Satan-hearted Heteroclite.
Call them hard napies, and do not fail to quote
The Saviour’s wordsfibqut the beam and mote;
Picturq with confldepce the dbipalgoal
That waits the inky sc ql of logersoll.
Be sure to terrify us once again
With stories of the death of Thomas Paine;
Tell how the Lord, as from a thousand throats,
Shall say to Darwin, ■ 1 Go among the goats,”
And Symes, of all audacity bereft,
Be sternly ordered off towards the left;
While Bright and Bradlaugh will be firmly jammed
Deep down amongst the vilest of tbe damned,
And the place occupied till then by Cain
Be heated up afresh for Chamberlain
(The peerless monster who incites the crowd
To have the Church of England disendowed).
Let all these things, Musophiles, have vent;
It is thy safest line of argument,
And truths like these thou only need’st assert.
And leave t e infidel to controvert;
The Church will pless thee—by whatever name
The Church is called—’twill bless thee all the same,
And prayers for thee ascend, most happy man,
In Scotch, In Latin, and In Wesleyan,
Thy name will be beloved by Christian men,
And large prosperity reward thy pen—
Though some Church pranks may move all Heaven
to mirth.
The Church is strong to bless or curse—on earth.

A Brisbane paper solemnly announces in
imply to a correspondent, that !, y ■n; ish law a
man is not allowed to marry hi« wife ■ deceased
sister. »bat a fund of information these No them
papers must have, to be sure.
“ Marriage with a tinge of romance,” says
an exchange, “ Is what they call it in Kansas when
the old man rides after the couple, aid shoQts the
hat off the bridegroom’s bead with an army car-
bit e. j hey call It a romantic n atriage in Michigan
when a couple of the neighbours get the bride’s
father inte a back room end tit on him to pre-
vent his interrupting and breaking up the wed-
ding.” ’.these ate rum-antic marriages. We used
to call It a romantic marriage in Australia 20
years avo, when the groom dathed to the door
of the lady’s homestead station, and, stooping
from the saddle, placed her before him, and
“got.” Then the old man rooted the boys up,
caught some hortes, and with half-a-dozen blacks,
picked up the tracks of the runaway, and started
in pursuit, arriving at‘the next static n, 50 miles
away, just In time to see the J. P. kiss the bride.
Then the old man and the groom had 22 rounds
in front of the station, after which the health of
the bride was dtunk in pint-pels of rum, and so
were inaugurated tome of our aristocratic
families.
They do these things better in Maitland.
In that bustling town live a Mr, Dutton and a
Miss Frances Rley. They Jive together, 'the
fact that they are unnamed appears to give them
no uneasiness. Not being ia ** society,” they
mate no pretence of conforming to 11 s edicts.
Still, Mr. Dutton has feelings with which It is not
safe to trifle. 80. the other day, seed, g Miss R ley
engaged m some harmless familiarity with a full-
grown man, he stepped to the front, and a m: ment
afterwards Frances found h rselt standing on her
head with imr heels gyrating in space, F r this
proof of tifectloi! Mr. Dutton was secured by a
lynx-eyed ptace-officer and brought Ute-d-tete
with the Mayor, when the following ensued:—
M : “ Why don’t you get married, and then you
would have a right to prevent other men inter-
fering with her? ’ (Be might have added, - And
can wallop her whenever you’re low-tpirlted and
want reo eation.”) D.; “ Well, after this is settled,
I shall not live in this fashion again with her.”
M.: 'h'o», It you premise to many her we will
■let you off.” D. (promptly;: •‘twill.” M.: “ Well, if
you will bring toe certificate to my office showing
that you have got married, I will give you a
weeding present ” After this singular courtship
we trust that Mr. Dutton will find no occasion to
retain his bride's affection by means similar to
those adopted to secure her maiden troth.
At a Timaru (N.Z.) boarding school break-
up, the Rev. Mr. Turnbull lectuied to an audience
of girls on a subject about which they had proba-
bly forgotten more than he ever knew. The Rev.
Sir Oracle observed“ Do not coniine yourselves
too much, dtah young ladies, to the drawing-room
or the pianola, or floe crotchet-work, or crysto-
leum, or the like, but take an earnest part In the
duties of the household. The Scriptures teil us
that Rabeccuh, although a young lacy of rank and
wealto, did not stay indoors sounding the timbrel,
or whatevah musical Instrument was in fashion in
Mesopotamiah, but was in the habit of going
to ihe well to draw the watah wanted
for her fathah's flocks and camels, and it
was whilst so employed that she met with
her future husband, who was the most
eligible young man in all the land.” Like
Tennyson's heroine, thegirls “spoke never a woid
nor wept,” just then, but next day one of the in-
dignant maids wrote to tha local paper and went
for the reverend one in this way— ‘ I would re-
spectfully remind our woithy Rev. Mr. Turnbull
tnat there are 500 girls in this town who would
willingly draw water for camels, or atv other
beasts, and get up quite as ea ly as Rebecca
used, providing they could find another Isaac at
the pump as she cid. We consider Bathuel’s big
girl was very highly favoured in having such a
model husband provided lor her. In these days
we have to use the best means at our command to
attract, and yet, even though we are ready to
do all things, from playing Chopin down to chop-
ping wood, still, many of us get lelt, and fail to
secure a husband of any kind whatever. Read
Apelles to the Cobbler—“Ac sutor ultra
crepidam ’’—Laura T.
Now that society Is everywhere en-
deavouring to discover new spheres lor female
industry, it is rather discourag ng to be told by
the N.S, W. Postmaster- General that the practice
of employing females as operators in the Tele-
graph Department has been discontinued, Mr.
Superintendent Cracked! most ungailantly de-
claring that ladies are not suited for the business.
t seems to us only toe other day, as it were, when
Sir Saul Samuel, tm-n ex-P.MG., Mr. Minister
Burns, P.M G , and this same Mr. Cracknel!, were
killing eaeh other oyer the quegtiop of who wapi
the most deserving of the three to lay plaint'to
the honor of being the first to introduce ladies
into the service. As operators in the head-office
at Sydney they were most decided failures, but
then so are many of the male operators also. The
Wheatstone automatic system was tried at the
same time, the ladies being employed as
“punchers,” and so carefully did they mtss up
the business that the Victorian Parliament passed
a motion imploring the N.S.W. Government to
call off its girls at once, or the whole of the
Cabbage Garden would speedily Le trans-
formed into one gigantic iunaiio asylum.
Accordingly, the “Wheatstones” were rele-
gated to ihe cel’ar, alter something like
£6OOO had been wastpd on the fad, §,nd the fa|r
"punchers” were initiated into tiie mysteries of
the Morse machine. In ibis Hue tney were more
successful, and it is not correct to say that females
are uusuiied for managing small suburban or
country stations. Taking one example at hap-
hazard, we may mention that the telegraph mis-
tress at Randwick has been working irom 12 to 11
hours a day for some considerable time past, and
during her seven years service has conducted her
office in a way which many of our male tele-
g.aphlsts would do well to copy. Surely Mr,
(kvcaneil does not dare say that ladies like this
are unsuited for the business? 'ihe greatest
objection that can Le raised is that girls will man y
(tour out of the six original eleitras marrieu
gentlemen, in tne service), and, as a matter of
course, the services ofim “relieving officer ” are
required with painful punctuality, in these
cays of assisted immigration this is but
a venial fault, however, and we require
something lar more grievous hmore we acknow-
ledge that ladies are unsound for the telegraph
•my more than for the sewing-machine.

his debut as a cricketer in a match played between
two Penrith olubs-the Kenilworth and Pember-
ton-a few days ago. As soon as young Charlie
was sent in to bat, the Pemberton captain declined
m go on with the game, as he didn’t care to lower
his dignity by playing with boys. He was told
that though a boy in age the youngster was a man

“A champion totalisator dividend was
mid at Napier, N.Z , recsntly, where one investor
on a hack race received a return of £306 for £l.
This is the largest dividend paid since the intro-
duction of the totalisator.” So writes an evening
contemporary, and while we would not willingly
he accused of hasty condemnation of misleading
naravraohs, we must call the attention of our
contemporary to the fact that in 1881 a dividend
of something over £9OO was paid on D.O.D, at the
totalisator office in Adelaide. The circumstances
of the case were, however, peculiar. D.O.D. s
number appeared with the rest of the field, and a
uounl was placed on it by a fancier. While show-
ing the number 1 as invested on him, the clerk
allowed the horse’s number to slip out of sight,
and the publie supposing him to he scratched,
backed other fancies. D.O.D, romped home, and
his lucky hacker drew the total investment on
the race.
Tom Malone and Foley are likely to meet
in the ring. Not on the fight, you know, but on
the travel. Foley says if Malone will put on a
pair of boxing-gloves, he will undertake to catch
kirn in a 24ft. ring. This is probably the first time
such a contest has been suggested, and the Pane
of such a meeting would ha very doubtful. Tom
could no doubt get away, but Foley’s knowledge
of ring tactics would likely help him to win.

The business push which characterises
Sydney people was prominently noticeable last
week, when we were shown a card sent by a local
undertaker to Foley and his coadjutor, Cansdell, at
the gymnasium, setting forth the charges for vari-
ous interments, and soliciting the patronage of
the athletes. Perhaps, in view of the number of
challenges at present afloat, the undertaker thinks
a monopoly of athletic undertaking would be
valuable.

The Prince Alfred Yacht Club first-class
race on Saturday last resolved itself into a match
between Mr, Milson’s Waitangi and Mr. Fitz-
hardinge’a Electra, the former conceding 6min. to
Mr. Fitzhardinge’s yawl. It was originally in-
tended to sail an outside course, but as the sea
proved too heavy to moor a boat off Curl Curl, it
was decided to substitute the Manly course. Mr.
Eeks was in charge of the Blectra; and Mr.
"Pros” Williams, so well known as a successful
open-boat sailor, handled the Waitangi. The
Blectra was “ never in it.” and was beaten by Bmin.,
in addition to the 6mln. handicap. It is rather a
new experience to see the name of Fitzhardinge
bringing up the rear so consistently, and until the
yawl is altered in her rig Mr. Fitzhardinge cannot
hope to occupy any other place, for no handicap
in reason can bring the yachts together at the
finish of a race over the outside course.

On behalf of the fishermen of Port Jack-
son and Botany we appeal to the Pyrmont Re-
gatta Committee to place on their programme a
race for the toilers of the sea. The Admiral, Wild
George, and others are worthy of recognition, and
the race might well take the place of the " mixed”
race. We do not wish to be considered “damp
blankets,” but, to our thinking, a racing boat is
no place for the gentler sex, even though the con-
test is confined to pleasure suits. Some fair,one
will “ hang out ” too far some day in a blow, and
come to grief.

A “good sort ” of sportsman was William
Lowe, the unfortunate who was “ found dead ” ia
a Sydney suburb the other day. Lowe at one time
owned Lord Orville, Speculation, and Solicitor,
but he never made much at the game, and it was
not until Lord Orville fell into Kelso’s hands that
the horse showed the stuff he was made of. K=’lso
won Tattersall’s Cup and Handicap in one day
with Lord Orville, young Kelso, then known as
"The Dodger,” piloting him home in fast time.

The A.J.C. have advertised for a starter,
who will receive the fabulous sum of £l5O per
annum for his services, ft remains to be seen if
they can get a man to work “ square,” on such a
pittance. That they will get any number of appli-
cations for the post we doubt not. “A bit” to
nothing on the quiet from owners of favourites
would no doubt make up quite a decent screw, but
suspicious mortals such as the racing public would
a shade sooner see the wealthy A.J.C. make the
billet worth keeping straight for.

Messrs. Cox and Maitland, and Smith and
Darrell, of the Glebe Rowing Club, rowed off on
Saturday last to see which pair wan best qualified
to represent the club in the Junior Double Scull
race at the coming Pyrmont regatta. It was a
good race for a quarter of a mile, when Cox and
Maitland drew out a lead and won rather easily by
a couple of lengths.

New South Wales’ outlook for the Inter-
colonial Eight-oar race is most promising. The
crew is a first-class one, Mr Merriman has borne
the expense of fitting up a practice boat, and the
Mercantile Club has donated £35 towards the ex-
pense of sending the crew to Melbourne. Mr. C.
Bros has been elected captain and stroke of the
crew, and Mr. George Brett has been chosen as
coach. So far as the latter selection is concerned
wo think a mistake has been made. George
is the amateur oarsmen of a century, can nt up
a crew with any man, amateur or professional, in
the land, hut, good as he is, we doubt his ability to
row with and oiaoh an eight at one and the same
time.

An American journal, which “ skited ” to
a disgusting* extent about Haalan when the Cana-
dian was in the zenith of his glory, has now dis-
covered that Hanlan, though possessed of a good
turn of speed, was never a game oarsman, to m
more strokes, says this weathercock writer,
Trickett would have rowed him down on the
Thames, and in hts last race with Teemer he was
thoroughly cowed before a quarter of a mile had
been covered. When John L. Sullivan is beaten
the Yankees will, no doubt, plek bim to pieces in
the same manner, although they now laud him to
the skies.

On Wednesday evening the Gymnasium,
George-street, Sydney, was crowded to witness
some half-dozen merry turna-up Dooley s battle
with Wilson, which was to have been the item of
the evening, did not come off, Wilson being
absent. Lawson and Williams fougbt the four
liveliest rounds, in which the little darkey showed
the most foot—and band—though Williams fought
gamely right throi gh the battle. Smith and
Fuller followed, and the former got in some good
work, being very quick with his head and hands.
Bathgate, who is improving very much in the use
of his right hand, made a good fight with Nolan,
who, however, scored most points in a well-
contested battle. The usual variations of the
programme were presented, including dumb-bell
swinging and singlestick exercise. On Saturday
evening the hall was again crowded, and as the
ring was pitched on the newly-erected stage, a
much better view of the sport was obtained.
There was some disappointment in the opening
items, as Bathgate, who should have met Lawson,
was not to the fore. Cansdell gave an exhibition
of club swinging, after which Fuller and Anderson
sparred a merry three rounds, in which at the
finish the honours were easier than the hits. Alter
Lawson sparred a nice, showy fight with a mend,
Foley and Cansdell had a bout with the sticks, in
which the former warrior scored a win. ihe
battle of the evening was between Dooley and
Nolan, four rounds, for a tenner, but Nolan was
satisfied very early in the game. In the opening
round the men fought warily, but Dooley getting
an opening led off with a heavy left hander, which
be followed quickly with the right, and dealt it
out so smartly that the rally ended with a knock
down. The second round was short though merrv,
and Nolan, who does not appear to be a glutton,
cried a crack, after the second visitation of the
long ’un’s left hand.

Bicycle men in the States have been fairly
slaughtering previous American records. A bicycle
race, 36 hours, between William M. Woodsideaud
T. W. Eck, undertaken mainly for the purpose of
beating record time at different distances, com-
menced at the Washington Roller-rink, Minne-
apolis, Minn., on an eight-lap track, December
at 8.15 p.m. Woodside’s machine came to grief,
and during the changing Eck got the lead and
rod© 50 miles in 3b. 56m. 535., and 51 mi'es we e
put together by him in 3h. 495., which beat the
former record. Eck then temporarily retired, ana
Woodside rod© on, upsetting former records up to
and including 65 miles, ss follows: *53 miles, 3b.
6m. 545.; 53, 3b, 11m, 7s.;' 54, 3b. 15m. 165.; 55. 3b.
19m, 3Ts.; 56,3 b. 23m. 335.; 57, 3b. 37m. 18s.; 58,3 b.
3lm. 315.; 59, 3h. 35m. 418.; 60, 3b. 39m. 435.; 61, 3a.

56m. 355.; 65, 4b. 13m. At this stage of the race he
was well ahead of the record, but stooped for a
few minutes, intending to go on and beat the 100-
mile figure, which he could easily have accom-
plished. His trainer made a mistake, however,
and did not call him, and the opportunity went
past. Seventy miles were coverea in 4h. 38m. 365.
over six minutes behind former figures, and he did
not resume record-making ti l he had passed
Young’s limit, 357 miles, the farthest distance fiir
which any authentic record previously existed in
America for a consecutive hours race. Wood-
side rode 357 miles in 24b. 45m. 33j., as against
Young’s 3Sn. 19m. 595. for the same distance, and
then he established the following new records:—
358 miles, 34h. 50m. 365.; 359 miles, 34b. 55m. 353.; 260
miles, 35b. 333.; 361 miles, 35b, 37m. 445.; 363 miles,

Jack Burke and Mike Cleary met in a
genuine “ knock out,” at Chicago, on Bth Decem-
ber, when Burke proved the victor in Bmin. 30 ec
Both men weighed about list. lllb. At exactly 10
o’clock the men faced each other, sparred an
Instant for an opening, and a moment later Cleary
went to grass from a terrific hack-hander from
Burke’s left, which struck him square in the eye
and brought blood. The round finished with some
ineffectual attempts on Cleary s part to get in his
right on Burke’s face. The second round panned
out rather favourably for Cleary, who got in a
stinging counter with hla left on Burke’s cheese.
He tapped him gently twice more, and the round
closed with some cautious sparring on both sides.
When the men stoed up for the third round
Burke’s pink and glowing skin showed in strange
contrast to the almost marble whiteness of Cleary’s
line face and physique. Burke’s whole aspect was
eloquent of vigour and confidence, yet Cleary,
pale and supple, looked well his match. Early in
this exciting bout Cleary got what later proved to
have been the blow that decided the contest.
Cleary forced the fighting at first, but Burke soon
crowded in on him Impetuously, forced him
into his corner, hit him two rattling blows on his
face with his left, then parrying Cleary’s right
with his own right glove struck the NewYoraer
on the neck. Cleary staggered and seemed dazed
for a moment, then recovered himself with an
effort, and forced Burke desperately to the oppo-
site side of the ring It could be seen that Cleary
was breathing heavily, land shook slightly witn
suppressed excitement; while Burke, perfectly
cool and collected, watched calmly for his chance.
It came, and quick aa a flash, his arm came round
and landed with terrific force on Cleary’s Jugular,
and he fell like a log. The blow caught him
fairly Just beneath and behind his 13ft ear, and
knocked him senseless. “He’s killed him,” some
one muttered. The great crowd of spectators
were silent. Burke stepped up to his fallen adver-
sary, and, as Cleary did not move, but lay stretched
at full length, stooped over and shook him gently,
his face exhibiting genuine alarm. A little later
Cleary’s prostrate form showed signs of life, and
the crowd arose with wild cries of “Burkel
Burke!” It seemed as though the platform
would be torn in pieces when the champion
climbed over the ropes and walked Jauntily to his
dressing-room, every wblt as steady as when he
came out. Cleary’s seconds picked him up and
assisted him to his room, where he revived in a
few minutes.’ After the contest the excitement
was intense, and Cleary stated that it was a chance
blow, “ one like I have landed many a time with
the same result.”

It is amusing the way the gladiators talk
fight and yet cannot come to terms. Lees, in Mel-
bourne, is offering all comers a “fiver” to face
him four rounds; Jackson will meet Lees, but not
in Melbourne; Dooley has an offer out to meet all
comers (bar Foley) in Sydney for £100; and Foley
and Newton are near to and yet so far from a
match. Of all these fighters Foley is the only
man who has shown ho means business, as his £5O
to bind the match with Newton is now in the
hands of J. D. Young. If the papers would insert
a challenge only upon the putting up of a sub-
stantial deposit we should have more fight and
less talk. Less talk, anyhow.

The Melbourne Club did well in not yield-
ing to the rush made by Harry Boyle’s clique to
to have that player included in tbe Australian
Eleven. It is • a matter of opinion whether it
would not be advisable to send another man with
the team, more especially as “ the stuff ” is not
the sole consideration of the tour, but that man
should certainly be a batsman. If Macdonnell will
go, there should be no hesitation in including him.
The team Is quite strong enough in the bawling
department (Boyle’s only qualification). We can
dispense with the pictures this time, Harry.

The result of the Cup match between Sydney
University and Belvldere Cricket Clubs, in Avhich
the latter scored a win by the first Innings, shows
the absurdity of the rule laid down by the ground
committee, limiting the play to two naturdays,
and deciding the contest by the result of the first
Linings in the event of the match not being
played out. That in this case the better team lost
there can be no doubt.
* * *
The Carltons and Warwicks start their
match for the Cup on Saturday, and probably the
best game of the season will be the outcome, as
the teams are very evenly matched. As there is
not the ghost of a show of completing two innings
on two afternoons, the clubs should try and come
to some arrangement which would enable them
to play the game out.

The annual contest between Parliament

It would seem that there is an epidemic
of husband-poisoning in Australia. The horrible
Maitland (N.8.W.) case is still fresh in the public
memory; a Victorian woman appears to have just
arsenieised her man, burnt his body, and appro-
priated his money; at Koma (Q ), the body of
Robert Birkett, supposed to have been poisoned
by his wife in December, 1883, has been exhumed.
Attempts were made to raise the coffin, but, being
rotten, they were unsuccessful, and the inexorable
law, in the person of Dr. Comyn, descended the
grave to secure the parts required by the analyst,
who, despite the long lapse of time, .may. alter
all, succeed in circumstantially verifying the tale
of murder. Mrs. Birkett is publicly accused ot
having had a hand in another attempt at muraer.
It is plain that State regulations as to the sale of
poisons, more especially the volatile poisons, can-
not be made too stringent.
One result of the late Russian scare was
the establishment in N.S.W. of a lot of Volunteer
Reserve Corps. Some of them attended the apo-
theosis of Plain Bill, the Soudan medal distribu-
tion, last Saturday, in their martial attire and—
went home to resign. The crowd, not appreciating
the prompt! gs which devoted them to
made cruel fun of their slop-made uniforms and
ridiculous equipments. Not content with doling
them out clothes which gave them the appear-
ance of undertakers’ men after a heavy drunk, the
“authorities” had not even taken the trouble to
adjust the clothes to the wearers. Men of sft. iSin.
marched past in uniforms that would have fitted
John Lucas; tall, portly men strutted in suits
which would have well become a slim telegraph
boy They carried antiquated, brass-mounted,
muzzle-loading rifles, and wore rusty-looking
belts apparently of pre-Crimean date. No wonder
the crowd roared, but —oh, yes, happy thought:
Unvarnished William must have suggested the
joke to turn the ridicule aside from the gallant
Goat and Donkey Brigade and the Idiots who con-
ceived the fizzle.
From an Auckland paper (Sir Alexander
called at Auckland on nls way to England):—
“What an extraordihary-looking man this Sir
Alex. Stuart Is I Looking at him, no on© wpuld
ever dream that he was a man who had attained
to political or any other desirable eminence. We
have one or two very rough-looking diamonds in
our own legislature, but the ugliest of them is a
marvel of beautv compared witn the ex-Premler
of New South Wales Were I a resident of ihat
country l should certainly be deeply grieved that
the colony was not represented by a politician
who looked like a member of the human species.”
There, that s from New Zealand. Only wait till
the States are reached, and our American es-
c’ranges find our that Sir Mick is getting £lOO a
month to stop away from the colony.
We are extremely sorry to hear, on the
authority of a Sunday paper, that Mrs Mary
<Uadstane (Mrs. L. M. Bayl ss), whom old-time
players will remember as a highly talented actress,
is in Sydney, in want.
The North Australian announces the

A young couple were to have heen mar-
ried in Cooktown (Q.) lately, but the match

A Derangement of the Liver

—AND—
IfcTEIESTT'OTJS
STSTEH.
Below will be found a brief summary of a Lecture upon the Liver, delivered before
the Electric College of Medicine, by y
DR. J. HAYDOCE,
The Liver has been known as the great blood-maker and blood-purifier of the Circulation Frnm
®'f, e * Dd spongy structure It plajs a most important part In the animal economy, as regards
assimilation and nutrition. Food taken in the mouth and acted upon by the digestive organs of thn
stomach is converted into Glucose and Peptone, and in these forms enters the Portal vein. Here hr
the action of the liver, these substances are converted into a form of sugar and pass out of the iivaV
by a large vein, called the Hepatic vein, into the general circulation. The new material now formed
system*” 0 purposefl ’ viz - ; the maintenance of heat in the body and assisting in the cell growth of the
Dr. Murchison says. “ The composition of bile and its secretion is very complex. It is constants
ifelr « y i he l i v i ,r ’^ nd ’ increasing suddenly before eating, gradually decreases as soon as the
lss A tlBfled and feeding ceases.” Now, if this most important organ of the body becomes
torpid, op the passage of bile interfered with, emaciation and disease ensue. I note eight marked
peculiarities that now occur, and which we all know of maiaea
1. The patient complains of a feeling of weight and fullness of the stomach.
Distension of the bowels by wind.
Heartburn.
A feeling of weariness, pains in the limbs and great sleepiness after meals,
A bad taste in the mouth, especially in the morning, and furred tongue.
Constipation, with an occasional attack of diarrhoea.
Headache in front of head.
8. Depression of spirits and great melancholy, with lassitude and a disposition to leave
everything for to-morrow.
ikll of the above symptoms go to show functional derangement of the liver: and now comes the
amt topprtenoe of any error made as to the condition of the patient. He should immediately pro-
vide himself with a LIVER STIMULANT, the most common form of which is a Pill Dally ex-
perience shows that this, when the PiJl is compounded properly, is the readiest mode of inciting* and
promoting the action of the Liver, and can be almost always relied on. I have devoted many years of
SwfP’oQ 8 « n nm y ,, 0 o f B 011 P. ow before me know, to compounding a Pill that will act readily and system-
atiealiy as a Bilious Remedy. Ido not believe in great purgatives, and therefore have made a Pill,one
of which Is an active and thorough dose. I have called it * t m, one
Or. Haydock’s lew Liver Pill (Sugar Coated.)
One Pill is a Dose! One Pill is a Dose! One Pill is a Dose!
Vor all Diseases of the Kidneys, Dr. Haydock’s New Liver Pills are a perfect cure,

Carnrick’s Cod Liver Oil &
n . n PEPTOWISED (DIGESTED.)
Highly recommended by the Medical Profession throughout the world as being
the best remedy; for Coughs, Colds, Bronchitis, Scrofula, Wasting
Diseases, Consumption, General Debility, over-taxed brains, &c., &a.
it will produce an immediate gain in flesh and strength.
Can be taken when all other forms of Cod Liver Oil are refused.
It contains about equal parts of the best Norwegian Cod Liver Oil and concen-
trated fresh milk, both peptouised (digested).
The peptonised milk disguises the unpleasant taste and smell of the oil. and
raakes it as sweet as cream; very palatable and most nourishing.
Invaluable for children, and will agree with the most delicate persons, causing
no_ return or unpleasantness.
On§ trial will satisfy anyone of the great value of this new and unique pre-
paration.
The reconstructive or nutritive properties are five times greater than the
r? Other Emulsion, hence it is much cheaper.
Both the Oil and the Milk being digested, the whole will assimilate, whereas
vod Laver Oil and other Emulsions (being undigested) only a small
proportion is of any value. It is the most nerfect Emulsion ever
made and the only one of digested Cod Liver Oil and Milk.
Analysed and recommended by the first Professors in Europe.
We also manufacture the above preparation combined with Hypophosplutes
of Lime and Soda. SOLD BY ALL CHEMISTS

Carnrick’s Soluble Food for Infants, Invalids,
and Aged Persons, is the most nutritions, palatable, and easily-digested Infant’s
Food ever manufactured, containing fifty per cent, of thesolids of milk (digested)
and fifty per cent, of the finest wheat, converted into soluble form.
A most perfect food. The nearest approach to Mother’s Milk ever made
It is unequalled for the formation of fat, flesh, and bone, and increasing
the vital forces SO necessary to health.
Specially recommended in cases of Marasmus, Diarrhoea, and Cholera
Infantum, and where the digestion is defective.
Children fed upon cereals or cow’s milk alone very often remain weak, and
suffer from softening of the bones, and when attacked by infantile dia-
orders are unable to resist the inroads of disease.
CARNRICK’S SOLUBLE FOOD ” is invaluable for Invalids
and Aged Persons (who cannot digest farinaceous food), as it is rich
in nutritive and easily-digested albumenoids, thus increasing both flesh
and strength, and restoring the vital forces.
It is most convenient fcr use,being in a powdered form, and will keep indefinitely.
When boiled and stirred for three minutes it is ready for immediate use.

That’s j ust the sum Alfred paid his Commissioner
who went round the world in several days, ihe
amount, however, is not likely to be “ too much
glory ” for Sir Alexander! We see, too, that young
Gussy’s salary, with £lsi. a day for travelling ex-
penses, amounts to over a thousand a year! Sul-
phur! There’s one thing, though, about Dibbs’
crowd—when they did undertake to send a man
along they did it, “ whoever suffered.”
The Melbourne Argus says of the English
political situation:—“A strong coalition ot Con-
servatives. Churchmen, and Moderate Liberals is
what the Empire has most to hope for, and what
the situation may yet bring forth.” Tories,
Churchmen, and Moderate Liberals—Coin, Canr,
and Cowardice. These be the things that are to
save the Empire! The Argus, we have lately
observed, is becoming quite a pious paper, and
trying to out-Joev the local D.T., the organ ef
Holy Joeydom. Verily a oeath-bed repentance.
TO SIR PATRICK JENNINGS
(OF THE FOURTH PARTY.)
Sir Pat, we own up straight you are
A lot of tbiniis we’d like to be;
Superior to most by far
Who legislate, these days, with thee;
But here the trouble comes (tis rough:
For troubles seldom come alon -)
Ot backbone some have not en ugh,
While you have miles too much—backbone.
That august personage, Sir George Strahan"
the Tasmanian Governor, was so incensed by the
“insolence” of Mr. Service, the President of the
Federal Council, in reading an inaugural address
before the Council had been formally opened by
His Excellency, that he peremptorily declined to
attend ;the Council’s sittings. He was waited on
by Mi ssrs. Douglas and Dodds, two members of.
the local Ministry, who wagged their jaws for two
hours and a half ere they could induce the
“Queen’s representative ” to attend the po w-wow
Sir Henry Parke?, at Mr. Wise’s lecture,
stated tha f 75 000 peisms left Victoria in 1881
against 53CQ{j who entered, A Victo ian corre-
spondent nes w |cien to obserya that fjO 00Q ot the
75 000 left for tue cemetery, and aponjon of the
balance were played-out politicians who had
sought admission to Victorian benevolent asylums,
but tailing to ha returned male their way across
the border and re-entered Parliament as their only
refuge from destitution. We are glad our corre-
spondent admits that none of the Jive peop.e
found their way across the Murray. He does not
remark upon the destination of the dead ones.
“ The absentee tax is the invention of the
jaundiced eye and the soured mind,” is the Aus-
tralasian s opinion. Teat a person residing in
London and wading through seas ot mud in order
lo ieach a trumpery title suouid he ob iged to pay
a tnfie out of his immense income towards toe
revenue of th 1 ? country that stupidly allows him
to Jive on the labours of ethers is gall to this ultra-
Tory organ. It is wnen reading suon swill that we
long for the speedy arrival of the time—now well
on the road—when those whose happiness appears
to depend on the amount ot want around them
will have to pay i or their pleasure a price that will
astonish them.
“ February 7: Mary Evans, barque, from
Port Adelaide; 05 tons scrap iron." That’s an
announcement made in the “ Imports ” column of
a morning paper, and is worth notice. New
Zealand has a flourishing young iron works at
Onehunga making iron from native ores; the
Victorian Government has lately encouraged the
establishment of a new rolling-mills, by guaran-
teeing to take a certain number of tons ot oars,
&c , every year, and we , well, the other day,
a deputation came from the Esbana Iron Works
to protest against an increase oi rail way freight
from B*. a tun to Sydney to over £2 a ton. Oh,
yes I we are an enterprising people, we are
the sittings ot the Federal Council
a ’cipher message received by the lasmanian
Governor, and having to do with part of the
business in hand, loai d its way into tne columns
of tne Hobart Mercury before It was communi-
cated to the Council- fine President called atten-
tion to the subject, and stated that the message
had not been forwarded to the Press by himself.
No explanation has yet been given as to how the
telegram found its way into the Mercury, but
the fact is that Mr. Treasurer Burgess happened
to make the remark in the presence of some re-
porters that he believed the Governor had re-
ceived a cypher message, the tenor of which was,
&c.,&0.,&c. A “ chiel amang them ” took notes,
and the murder was out. Of course the other
papers represented at the Council were wroth at
the Mercury getting such information.
At the dinner given by the Tasmanian
Ministry to the members of the Federal Council
at Hobart recently, the toast of the Army and
Navy was omitted. After the remarks of Mr.
Douglas, the Democratic and plain-speaking Tas-
manian Premier, as to the ultimate outcome of
federation and his previous expressions of opinion
as to the unwisdom of expending money on the
defences of Tasmania, the omission may be
easily accounted for. As representatives of the
Army and Navy—in the persons of Colonel Legge
and tie captains of the men of war lying in the
harbour—were present at the banquet, the omis-
si >n of the toast cannot he regarded as an over-
sight.
In the name of the prophet—figs ! An
English paper reports th t. driving thro gh Wind-
sor a tew weeks ago, the Queen observed a cab-
horsw fall down On learning that, the animal ban
I maoe its last journey, “ner Majesty caused an
i intimation to be conveyed to the lamenting owner
I that he should be presented with another horse
I from the Royal stables.” Why. outside the Bee-
i hive, atSand/mrst (Vic.), we've seea a teamster’s
I litr e fail dead, and before it could be got out of
the road a collection among the brokers caused
, the owner to nait his team at the same place every
day for a month on the off-chauce of another
beast’s taking the blind staggers. How much old
her Majesty give to ilia Indian and Irish famine
funds ?
Sooner than be a British workman, Hux-
ley says that he’d prefer being a South Sea
Islander, any day. We believe him. But a man
like that would cause trouble anywhere. On an
equatorial coral rock of an acre’s extent this
iconoclastic professor might content himself—at
least until a missionary schooner appeared in the
offing, when the prospect of having a Bible pre-
sented to him would arouse his worst passions.
Bat at Tonga you’d find him skipping about with
the head cf the Wesleyan Church on a pole, while
in New Guinea he’d bo discovered with a rechauffi
of German boatswain on the sideboard. Yes, he’d
better remain in England. The Southern hemi-
sphere has quite enough people like him on hand
already.
Another clergyman has been sending up a
soulful plea for the general election penning in
Victoria. He is the Rev. Mr. Lawrence, and he
wants holy men in the House. “In voting, people
should have regard to a man’s moral character,
and should vote regardless of Ids political creed.”
That’s passing good for a parson, say an unctuous
ranter of religious family comes forward support-
ing a wholesale F, eetrade scheme, and he in op-
posed by a sceptical sinner, whose father was
hanged, and who runs on the Protection racket—
you must plump lor the saved one, though you
love Protection like a brother. Politics are oi no
count in Parliament What the nation is really
sickening tor are men who pay their pew-rent and
are spotless as the snow.
Reynolds’ Newspaper, which has a larger
circulation than any other journal in the world
and which contains the most forcinle and fearless
articles that have, perhaps, ever appeared in a
newspaper, quotes with its own endorsement a
recent article from The Bulletin, protesting
agaiast the appointment of orokea-down diplo-
mats and favourites, whose lives have
been passed in despotically-ruled countri s, as
Governors of these colonies. *• This,” says Rey-
nolds, “ is robust common sense, and in this way
at heart the toiling population of England think
to a man.” We have never before ventured to
comment upon such compliments as this, but we
depart from th® rule in the present Instance to
show that even in England the force of our
articles is acknowledged by men who are in the
highest sense capable critics of argument and
literary expression. The judgment of our Aus-
tralian readers is endorsed in the world of thought
in England.
Just at present one district of N.S.W.
appears to be on the eve of a civil war, the casus
belli being the extension of the railroad to Bur-
ro wa. Galong, Binalong, and Bowning, are each
fully impressed with the idea that the proper
route is through their respective graveyards, but
as the line has been already surveyed from the
farmer place (famous in history as the home of
the great O’Nagle Ryan), it seems to have the
bulge on its rivals just at present. The Minister
for Works having been informed that this route
is far longer and more difficult to run than that
of Bowning, has stopped the works, however—a
proceeding which may lead to his wearing a
swelled head when the Galong champion Slattery,
M.L.A. returns. Whether a railway should go to
Burrowa at all is a matter of some doubt, as those
who know predict that it will not return enough
to grease the carriage wheels. It is said that two
carriers have been aide to do all the trad between
Binalong and Burrowa for several years past,
and one of these is so “ full ” of the game now,
that he is willing to sell out for £lO. And yet this
is the place that is howling mad to have a railway.
From the Macleay Argus :—“ Everyone
with the slightest knowledge of public affairs is
acquainted with the fact that Mr, K. Burdett
Smith, to give him his full title, is the laughing
stock of tue House, and his prosy platitudes and
Curveydrop stylo serve only to amuse the mem-
bers. He has as much real iufluence in the House
as King Billy of the Cloncurry has over the
destinies of the Christian religion.” This is very
ciuel. But not so much so as the fiual blast of
this village critic, for after alluding to articles
denrec ttory of Mr. Dangar which have appeared
in Sydney dailies, and which are alleged to have
been designed to Influence the Elections and
Qualifications Committee, the village critic
savagely out majestically observes:—“Mr. Smith,
if he had a spark of manllne ; s in his composition
would retrain from this miserable crying and
snivelling ant calmly await the decision of the
tribunal to which his case has been referred.”
This is rough on the Beautiful Burnett, but even
if we were to believe that his rugged manliness
had departed we would still be happy in knowing
that Its loveliness will ever remain so long as there
is a pair of cunlng tongs in the rand.
The mud-slinging sitting of the N.S.W.
Assembly last week elicited the welcome informa-
tion that Sir Henry Parkes and January Davits
are not able or inclined to work together. The
one fear of the supporters of Sir Heary was that
hm acceptance of office would involve accession ot
influence to the Orange and cold-waier bigots.
His wretched alliance .with the Davies, Roseby,
Lloyd, and Henaon crowd burst up Sir Henry s
pov,er once beiore. and a similar alliance would
ruin him now. The incidents leading up to tne
present rupture are in keeping with the known
habits of the sinuous John. Sir Henry jocularly
asked him the reason of his sudden support of a
Ministry he had been previously opposing. Sir
John then annaunced to the House that Sir Henry
had tried to engineer a Government supporter.
There is a link wanting to complete—it is not
known who ingeniously perverted and distorted a
jocular remark into a subtle attempt to secure the
secession of a Government supporter. It John
Davies did not do this, he should assert the fact,
for in absence of evidence to the contrary strong
suspicion will rest upon him. John was careful to
explain that he has “nothing to expect from Sir
Henry, so the severance of the friendship is of
little moment to him.” The inference is that John
only maintains political friendships with those
from whom ae has something to expect.

To the mechanical order, and to many
others who, being occupied in earning a liveli-
hood, find themselves debarred from attending the
curriculum of the University, the evening classes
of the Technical College attached to the
Sydney School of Arts are of Incalculable
value. We have not a list of the c asses
before us at this moment, but we have several
times gone carefully through one, and have always
risen from the perusal with a sense of satisfaction.
Not the least practical is the course presided over
by Mr. 8. Herbert Cox, F.C S. “ Mines and
Minerals—a Guide for the Australian Miner,” of
which Mr. Cox and Mr. Felix Ratte, Mineralogist
to the Australian Museum, ara the joint authors,
lies before us. This is probably the most
valuable contribution to technical informa-
tion in connection with Australian mining
which has ever issued from the Press,
and in these colonies, where fresh discoveries are
daily being made in districts previously regarded
only in relation to their grazing value, and where
the selector, the stock-rider, and the shepherd
trample under foot for years Indications of untold
treasure, which thrust themselves upon their ob-
servation, and only utter ignorance of minerals
prevent them from recognising or profiting by,
such a volume should have a universal circulation.
It is written in plain language, and the text is
helped out with frequent cuts. The work is ex-
cellently printed by John Woods and Co., Bridge-
street, and contains about 350 pages.
The most diverting—to non-members—of
the many Melbourne societies is that which has
kindly taken upon itself the task of expounding
the unexpressed ideas of Divine William. The
Shakespeare Society meets once a month to dis-
cuss *' papeis.” Now, there are many methods of
concocting papers on Shakespeare’s heroes and
heroines. The student can confine himself to dis-
cussing certain characters as superficially sketched
by the Bard; or he can, If ambitious, present them
in new and hitherto unsuspected capacities. At
the last Melbourne corroboree, for instance, a Mr.
Douglas upheld the view that Horatio had been
Hamlet’s tutor at Wittenberg University. This is
an interesting possibility which has escaped the
notice of everyone except Mr Douglas. Poor old
Shakespeare died without taking it into considera-
tion at all. He was a man who left questions to be
decided by posterity, which, with a little extra ex-
penditure of ink, he might have settled himself—
once and for ever. Sometimes, perhaps, the Bard
“played light” with certain characters from
motives of modesty. He is possibly aghast
at finding that Dr, Wilson, Secretary of
the M.S.S.. has read a paper dissecting the
character of Cressida. It can’t be helped. Every-
thing Shakespearian must be dissected sooner or
later, and the gicMy Cressida comes in with the
rest. By the way, Cnarles Dickens must have been
anticipating this Shakespeare Society when he
wrote “ Nicholas Nickleby.” There he Introduces
us to a gentleman who bad immortalised oimself of
writing a pamphlet of 300 pages about the deceased
husband of Juliet’s nurse. We Intend throwing
off just such another little work ourselves. Mr.
Douglass pager suggests to us “A Treatise on
Horatio: his official position at Wittenberg
University, and probable salary appertaining
thereto.” If it runs into many editions we may fol-
low on with “ Would Cressida have done the
Blot*?”
More in sorrow than in anger we clip the
following from our august contemporary, the
Botany Mbrcury;— “ Tommy Ah Fook is a celes-
tial savant, who was recently uufortmate enough
to fall under the displeasure Land fist] of a young
gentleman of the genus hoodlum, who rejoices in
the soubriquet of Jimmy King, Consequently he
was reluctantly obliged to prefer a charge against
the aforesaid JK. for ‘salt and battery’ (stat.
3 and 4 Viet.). During the course of the
magisterial enquiry, James (by the grace of God)
chanced to remark that a sweet, girly-girly young
creature, named;Venetia de Montmorenci Jones,
occupied the proud position of the partner of his
joys and woes, his superior moiety, otherwise his
wife. He was about to pursue his interesting
theme and describe how he had wooed and won
the gentle maid, and how “she loved him for the
dangers he had passed,” when T.A.F, unable to
contain himself longer, commenced beating a
wild tattoo on the floor with his heels as he
exclaimed in tne paroxysm of his passion: “ Netia
no wifee he I—sometime she pay talkee wlfee mo—
sometimes can makee find better man. Ah Sin,
makee talkee wifee he I Blenty time me thinkee
too muchee ’luniversal wifee 1 Too muohee wifee,
no can do! Me savee one day Chinaman come
’long, pay her cum-shaw—she no can belong
ploper pldgeon—.” “Will ycz kape solloncc in
the Coorte there beyantl” roared the Grecian
official in charge, as he gracefully assisted Mr. Ah
Fook into Her Majesty s coupe, known to the
vulgar as the “Black Maria;” and, as the indig-
nant genius from the Flowery Kingdom curled
himself up under the seat, a fellow-passenger was
heard to remark with jeering cynicism, “Kiss,
but never tell I” [W'e believe “cum-shaw” is
Chinese for “present,” and are of opinion that the
above is a celestial plagearism of the Laureate’s
“Enoch Arden,” where “she said she would be
little wife to both.”—En. B.]
A N.Z. yarn“ It was in Maorilaud, at a
place called the ‘ Mohawka Valley,’ at the foot of
the lovely Te Tiakoura range. It was late at night
(winter time), tea was over, those (bushman) who
resorted to the inn were seated before the biggest
fire it has ever been my lot to see inside of a build-
ing. The landlord sat in the corner. In reply to
my Inquiry, if I could have some supper, he said
yes, pats through the passage, across the yard,
into the dining-room. 1 took his advice, for he
did not attempt to show me. In the dark I felt
my way, but had not got far when I found my leg
fixed in a great hole in the floor, which well nigh
doubled me up. This over, I found the door,
stepped out or rather down on to a plank that led
from door to door, or, as it might bo explained,
from the main building to the dining room. It
was ‘rainy, the plank slippery, and I fell over on the
back of a pig; the brute got up, and in doing so
pitched me into a large tub of water. The bath
finished, the dining-room door was reached, the
only light being a common tallow dip, well nigh
burnt out. On the table was the dirtiest cloth I
had seen, knives without handle?, forks witbsut
prongs, cups without handles, with pieces broken
off all round the tops, bread as Hat as a pancake'
and hard as a bullet, a bone of mutton which J
swear had never been carved, for it bora the?
marks of some ones teeth, a plate full of potatoes,,
and a jug of cold tea. This was the spread I gtzedi
upon. I was hungry, could L get better, perhaps*
not, so I went for it. I required salt and pepper;;
on looking for such I spied two tin boxes upon
which I saw this label, ‘ Flea Powder these con-
tained salt and pepper, respectively; but no, I was*
unable to accept it, so got through the good things
as best I could. When finished, and before! had*
a chance to say grac?, the candle went out. What
a kettle o’ fish, hut thinks I the same way I got in
so I’ll get out; I did so to my sorrow, for, in dodg-
ing across the yar" 1 , Mr. Dog made for me; this
hastened my speed considerably through the door
to the tap or pot room, with a dog holding fast to
the seat of my trousers. Faithful creature, how
affectionately I spoke to him; so did his owner, who
kind y kicked him under the bonemill. Alter this
little Pit of fun was over, and being tired, I re-
quested to be shown to my bedroom. Bidding the
landlord good night I closed the door, pulled the
sheets off the bed, then turned in, put out the
light, but sleep I could not, the pillow was that
hard and lumpy, so that a thought struck me that
it would not be out of place if I opened the pillow;
so I got a light, found my knife, and set to work
on the pillow. Tne cause of all this trouble soon
showed Itself. I took from the inside the legs of
several fowls, two heads, four wings, and a large
stone. This completed, I laid down again; yet no
sleep; each t'me I dozed off sometning passed
over the bed. It was a cat after rats. At last I
did sleep; yet picture my astonishment in the
morning when I spied upon the chair beside my
bed the poor cat with seven dead rats in its charge.
What fun these poor creatures must have been
having whilst I slept the sleep of the righteous.
Breakfast was something after the same order as
the supper, rough-and-ready. The whole of this
grand entertainment cost at the rate of 103. per
day. The owner cf the hotel, or whatever it was
called, came from the Land o’ Cakes, be was a
bachelor, had no female in or about the place, and
did all his own housework. I left for Turanga-
kama immediately after breakfast, where, fora
few days I was the guest of a savage (Maori), as
some folk call the natives, here the food was
wholesome, and shelter all that could be desired.
The savage studied cleanliness, the Scotchman
Godliness.”

AYER’S
Cherry Pectoral.
No other complaints are so insidious in their
attack as those affecting the throat and lungs:
none so trifled with by the majority of suffer-
ers. The ordinary cough or cold, resulting
perhaps from a trifling or unconscious ex-
posure, is often but the beginning of a fatal
sickness. Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral has
well proven its efficacy in a forty years’ fight
with throat and lung diseases, and should be
taken in all cases without delay.
A Terrible Cough Cured.
“In 18571 took a severe cold, which affected
my lungs. I had a terrible cough, and passed
night after night without sleep. The doctors
gave me up. T tried Ayer’s Cherry Pec-
toral, which relieved my lungs, induced
sleep, and afforded me the rest necessary
for the recovery of my strength. By the
continued use of the Pectoral a perma-
nent cure was effected. I am now 62 years
old, hale and hearty, and am satisfied your
Cherry Pectoral saved me.
Horace Fairbrothee.”
Kockingham, Vt,, July 15,1882.
Croup.—A Mother’s Tribute.
“While in the country last winter my little
boy, three years old, was taken ill with croup;
it seemed as if he would die from strangu-
lation. One of the family suggested the use
of Ayexx’s Cherry Pectoral, a bottle of
which was always kept in the house. This
was tried in small and frequent doses, and
to our delight in less than half an hour tho
little patient was breathing easily. The doc-
tor said that the Cherry Pectoral had
saved my darling’s life. Can you wonder at
our gratitude ? Sincerely yours,
Mrs. Emma Gedney.”
159 West 128th St., New York, May 16, 1882.
“I have used Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral
in my family for several years, and do not
hesitate to pronounce it the most effectual
remedy for coughs and colds we have ever
tried. A. J. Crane.”
Hake Crystal, Minn., March 13, 1882.
“ I suffered for eight years from Bronchitis,
and after trying many remedies with no suc-
cess, I was cured by the use of Ayer’s Chee-
ky Pectoral. Joseph Walden.”
Byhalia, Miss., April 5,1882.
“I cannot say enough in praise of Ayer’s
Cherry Pectoral, believing as 1 do that
but for its use I should long since have died
from lung troubles. E. Braudon.”
Palestine, Texas, April 22, 1882.
No case of an affection of the throat or
lungs exists which cannot be greatly relieved
by the use of Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral,
and it will always cure when the disease is
not already beyond the control of

Health depends in a great measure upon the
soundness of the teeth and their freedom from
decay, and all dentists allow that neither washes

ing the teeth and keeping them sound and white
as a pure and non gritty tooth powder; such
Rowlands' Odonto has always proved itself to be.

GREAT
ANNOYANCE
has been caused
to all people using
tooth brushes by the
bristles coming out in
the mouth. The Pall
Mall Electric Associ-
ation now take pleasure
in introducing to the Aus-
tralian public a Tooth Brush, which they
guarantee free from this troublesome defect.
The bristles are inserted in the handle by a
patent process, which renders it simply
impossible to come out in use. In ad-
dition to this, the handle of the Brush is
made of a newly invented material perma-
nently charged with an electro-magnetic
current, which acts without any shock
immediately upon the nervesand tissues
of the teeth and gums. The act of
brushing causes this current to flow
into the nerve cells and roots of
the teeth, and, like water poured
upon a plant, it invigorates and
vitalizes every part, arresting
decay, building up and re-
storing the natural white-
ness of the enamel and
quickly producing
healthful, rosy-
coloured gums.
The handle'is strong,
beautifully polished,
not affected by acids,

Now offrr to the Aus-
tralian public their new
Electric Hair, Beard &
Moustache Curler, it
is a handsome article, nickel-
plated, with an ebonized handle, and it
should occupy a place in the toilet of
every lady and gentleman in Australia.
By its aid, the hair, beard, or moustache
can be curled in any desired style in from
one to two minutes. For ladies, it produces
the “ Langtry Style,” the “ Patti Bang,” the
“Montague Curl,” and any other styles
desired by ladies wearing their hair in the
fashionable “ loose and fluffy” mode.
Those who wear waves or other forms
of artificial hair will find this Electrio
Curler a very useful article. It does
not break off and ruin the hair,
like the ordinary crimping pro-
cess, and in wet or hot weather
it works as quickly as in cold.
For curling the Moustache
or Beard in a moment, it
has no equal, while it is
so simple in its opera-
tion that any one of
either sex cam use it
successfully the first
time.

“ Capers, old man,” he said, “ I’m afeared my

Adelaide (writes a correspondent), at one
time, as all Pressmen know, used to be facile prin-
tepa in the matter of counter-lunches. These
luxuries have now hecomo things of the past, all
through that fatal retrenchment among the Civil
Servants. Byron says “the Assyrian came down
like a wolf on the fold.” Perhaps he did, but
we'll go bail that Byron never saw a herd of un-
bmployed public “horfloers” come down on a
ttay of beef sandwiches, or he would have altered
the metaphor. “ Here, hang it all,” said a
Boniface, the other day, as he took one of the
burled darlings by the collar and ran him out,
“we can’t stand this, you know, for tuppence.”
The ejected one had got his molars fastened into
fully nine inches of German sausage, and in vain
did the landlord try to rescue it. So now they
don’t have any more counter lunches in Adelaide,
and every pressman you meet about Ila.m. drops
his lower jaw and looks like a motherless foal.
It was a study to see the face ot the proprietor ot
an Adelaide paper, the other day, when he began
tD feel a rumbling inside, and yelled out to the
office boy, for “the bother arf o’ that there meat
pie he left in the nail-can, yesterday. The office
boy. who had devoured it, presented himself at
the door, and said it had been thrown into the dust-
bin. and that he had seen the editor rooting around
there with his walking-stick. [We really can t be-
lieve this.—Ed, B.] The O. B, men fled, and when
his mother appeared at the nen next morning, she
Said. “ Blest if she knew wot wos the matter with
Obadiah, but get ’lm to go to the horflss she could
Wot, no matter ’ow she tried.” The boy was posi-
tively afraid of being eaten. O, yes, Adelaide is
ever such a nice place.
There is, probably, no place in tbis Austral

as in South Australia-the “ colony of churches.”
In addition to the regular "Sunday shows, in
which parsons of all sects with glowing emotion
and hyper-fervid eloquence—
“ Oft proclaim with holy fire
The labourer’s worthy of his hire;
frhich seems to be the sum total of nineteenth
century Christianity, they have certain afterpieces
which are called “ services of song. These are
dignified with such suggestive titles as Uncle
Tom’s Cabin,” “Billy Bray,’ ' Never touch It,
and other such fetching appellations. The climax
was capped, however, the other day, when they
out “ Robinson Crusoe ” on the boards of qne of
the Adelaide tabernacles. Just fancy singing to
the praise of the Almighty paraphrase on the
work of Dafoe relating tne ropeabie condition of
the lonely monarch when the man Friday brought
blm a keg ot horse-shoe nails instead of a hunk ot
salt-horse; or conceive the “ in-gathering of souls
which would result from chanting the ludicrous
failures of Friday to learn the English language.
But, never mind, the time-honoured sasser is
ever at the door. They have also “ober dar”
a “blind singing Evangelist,’ named Houston,
whom they play off when things don t seem to
boom in the other line. This unfortunate man is
carted about from Dan to Beersheba, and planted
down without ceremony on Glenelg Pier or
Blinman Plains, when he forthwith begins to
warble about the “ Golden Shoan ” without money
and without price, the elect carefully bagging the
coin, and thanking the Loard for a blessed time
at Blinman,” or a “glorious gathering at Glenelg,
as the case may be. Such stress is laid on the fact
that Mr. Houston is blind, that you have only just
to scratch the surface of the thing to find that it is
all the show biz. If the Evangelist could see, he
wouldn’t be a draw, or more probably still, he
wouldn’t be there at all.

The Orient Steam Navigation Company
have j ust issued in a handsome octavo form a
capital handbook relating to ocean travel. The
present edition is a successor to a truly magnifi-

for general diffusion. The work before us avoids
this drawback, and while it contains all the infor-

of London University. There were no less than
19 candidates for the post, of whom half were
University men. A lady fills a similar office in one
of the Parisian hospitals. At St. Kilda (Melb.) we
read upon a brass plate, “ Dr. Laura Morgan,” of
whom we may yet hear of as a candidate at an
hospital election.

and Spensley have done, and Wilson is trying to
do, but we should have imagined that there were

Rich Lord Mtz william has offered a re-
duction of 50 per cent, on last year’s Irish rents to
all tenants who pay un before Marcn 25th. Some
of the grovellers will behold in this a noble proof
of his Lordship’s generosity. Other people,
though, will detect evidence of his mortal funk,
lest he shouldn’t get any rents at all. My Lord
Pitz william is not the man to make a present of
anything that he ever stood the least chance of
getting. He once, if we remember rightly, closed
his coal mines rather than accede to the very
modest demands of his labourers. Looked at from
a sensible point of view, a landlord condemns him-
self when he offers a reduction of 50 per cent, on
rents he has previously exacted.
The unfortunate iron industry of N,B. W.
seems likely to be a howling joke for the Eoglish
experts, to judge by a parcel of iron ore and pig
iron now on view at the Sydney Exchange Tnis
parcel is intended for the Colonial Exhibition, and
has received the usual allowance of “ skite ” from
the Sydney dailies. The D.T. declares that the
iron has been examined by “experts,” and pro-
nounced to be of excellent quali'y. The same
“experts” would likely have declared the bad
iron in Dlbbs’ dump cars of excellent quality. At
ail events, the pig iron in question is simply
what is known to ironworkers as " blazed ” pig.
Of the iron ore, one portion, the brown hema-
tite, is fairly good; the lees said of the others the
better.
Everything can be got in London—except
a platypus. Mr. Jamrach, of the St, George s-
road, can provide, to fanciers, every bird, beast,
reptile, and fish-not of the sea-serpent and bun-
yip order—except a platypus. This ornithorhyncus
will not stand a sea voyage, and its proper fool
has not as yet been discovered. “ There is,” a re-
turned Australian writes, “ a great show for any-
one who can give to London this Australian
novelty.” It would be the “lion” of the forth-
coming colonial exhibition there. Mr. Jamrach is
ready to take consignments in quantity, and give
fabulous prices for this combination of bird,
beast, and fish—delivered alive. A C.M.G.-ship at
least, and perhaps a knighthood, awaits the suc-
cessful exporter.
A rather extraordinary decision was given
at the Stockport (Eng) Court recently by Judge
Hughes. A professional pedestrian, named Peter
Bt. Leger, of Macclesfield, claimed the recovery of
a gold watch from Daniel Ward, of Handworth,
under the following circumstances:—The plaintiff
and the defendant’s son had competed in a walk-
ing match, of which the defendant was the judge.
The defendant decided in favour of his son, and
the plaintiff alleged that his son had walked one
lap short. The Judge decided to have the match
walked over again in his own presence during the
following month, and choose a gentleman In court
to assist him In judging. Judge Hughes may be a
bit of a ped , but th* odds are he is about as fit to
judge a walking match as professional walker St.
Leger would be to take his seat on the Bench.
No greater sign of the extent to which the
at one time well-patronized sport of “ the ring ”
has fallen in England could be found than in tne
amount of trash written in the English Press over
a so-called fight for the “Championship of Eng-
land and £200.” between one Smith and one Davis.
The whole affair lasted about seven minutes, and
no less than six rounds were fought during that
period, so that the actual time the men faced each
other could not have been much longer than one
round as fought under the more civilised Queens-
berry rules Smith woo, Davis proving a mere
chopping block, and Smitn has now been put up
by more than one paper as the best man la Eng-
land, and one rag even states its belief that Smith
is the best man E gland ever produced. Shades
of Cribb, Molineux, Belcher, Gully, and Gregson,
how can you rest under such slander I It is enough
to send old Jem Mace across the briny to give the
“ oudaclous” Smith a hiding.
It is customary in Parkes, N.S.W., to give each
pupil a ticket to prove attendance, and these cards
have an illuminated text on them. Now, one of
the school mama has a brother who smokes
cigarettes and with each packet is presented a
small photo,, generally of an agreeably worldly
character—actresses, danseuses, and nidi. These
“ Little Beauties” as they are called, are works of
art, and the young ladv had collected about 40,
which she put In her Sunday dress pocket. One
of the deacons, to improve the occasion, told the
children, “ Now, try to think for yourselves and
model your lives by what you see on these simple
tickets which Miss Blank will give you at the
door. I’ll explain, next Sunday, anything you
don’t understand on them.” It strikes us he’ll
have to discriminate between Ellen Terry, Kate
Vaughan, and Lily Langtry next week. He may
have a word or two to say on Conny Gilchrist and
the abnormal understanding of the so-called
“ Gyro-falcon.”
The Sydney Morning Herald last week
published the following paragraph ;—“Tenter-
field.—Nominations for aldermen : Messrs. John
Strauss, David Moses, and Donald Henderson, for
Jared; Messrs. John Brown, and Edward Reeves,
for Whereat; Mr. William Grig, for Kilgour; and
Mr. David English, for Corney .” Tho Herald
should be commended for striving after original
ideas, and we accord the fullest respect which
youth should ever offer to age and Imbecility; but
In such matters as the names of persons running
for office, truth should he the prime feature, and
fancy merely utilised as the gilt-edged framework
which sets off the sketch. The gentlemen nomi-
nated to fill the aldermanic vacancies at Tenter-
field were, in reality. Messrs John Strauss, David
Moses, Donald Henderson, Jared John Brown,
Edward Reeves Whereat, William Craig Kilgour,
and David English Cooney. The subdivisions of
"Whereat,” “Jared,” “Kilgour,” and “Corney,”
exist only in the mind of theiHERALD man. They
are unknown in New England.
The “uncrowned king,” as his admirers
call Mr. Charles Stuart Parnell, “naps it” pretty
hotly from the many who are not his admirers.
These are samples of the way they send polite
congratulations to him with the compliments of
the season. They assume, In compliment, an Irish
character.—
Many happy returns of the saison, Parnell;
Falx you’ve throttled the Whig and bamboozled
the Tory,
An’ whin all of them blagyards is fryin’ in—well.
I’ll not minshin the place—you’ll be reignln in
glory.
So gently, my sprig o’ shillaly, and don’t, by suc-
cess, be misled,
In dragging your coat to the Saxon; you might,
perhaps, meet with a knock,
For we’ve heard of another “uncrowned” one
thus prldefully losing his head.
And you, like that other Charles Stuart, might
bring yourself to a “ block I ”
King Ludwig of Bavaria is still carrying
on bis ingeniously lunatic performances. He
keeps carefully out of sight, but contrives to pro-
vide matter for more chroniques about his private
doings than any of the visible monarchs of
Europe. King Ludwig s latest eccentricity is re-
markable even for him; he has been photo-
graphed. It came about in this wise. During one
of his solitary walks in the Bavarian Alps he en-
countered an unamiable ox, which barred the way
and refused to allow his Majesty to pass. For a
bovine subject to make himself so unpleasantly
conspicuous was not to be endured; wherefore
the king seized a plank which happened to be at
hand, and, placing himself in a position of attack,
as with a bayonet, he prepared to charge. Then,
of course, the surly ox sheered off, and allowed
the king to pass; and his Invisibility was eo
pleased with his own exploit that he had himself
photographed In the attitude of charging. We
would like to see some of our colonial lawyers
photographed in the attitude of charging. What
a picture could be produced I The modesty of
Ludwig would be entirely and completely eclipsed,
American papers at times, in their striv-
ings after truth, get almost on to the verge of un-
complimentary remarks. The New York Dra-
matic News thus describes the staff of the Her ALP
(not the S.M.H.):— s Anybody who knows any-
thing at all about the New York Herald knows
that it is at present conducted on what may be
called a basis of the strictest intemperance. That
is, every .one connected with it, eo matter in
what capacity or position, gets wildly and help-
lessly drunk as often as he possibly can without
doing permanent violence to his tenure of office.
The intellectual department of our esteemed con-
temporary has always got a head on it, so to speak.
When the managing editor returns to a brief inter-
val of sobriety, his junior next in rank proceeds
to get full as speedily and as thoroughly
as he can, and so on, from the top of tne ladder
to its lowest round, the long gamut of Intoxication
has been completely run. 1 ' We feel the very
greatest pleasure in mentioning that in this country
at least, temperance, soberness, and truth are the
distinguishing characteristics of literary men, few
of whom get “thatway” unless some one else
pays for it. We have occasionally seen men on
the statf of small up-country papers who did
tamper with the enemy, but these men were looked
upon as literary outcasts who would even go the
length of paying for drink when they could not
obtain it otherwise. Such men are, happily, rare,
Bulloch Night, the Afghan jemedar, who
brought to Australi' in 1856 the camels used by
the ill-fated Burke and Wills’ party, and subse-
quently accompanied the M’lntyre expedition in
1866, recently addressed a telegram to Baron Von
Mueller stating that he had discovered tne remains
of Leichhardt, the long-lost explorer—-the L ving-
stone of our Australian wilderness. No further
information was given, and little fai’h Is held in
the Afghan’s story, which, like that of Skuthorpe,
is looked upon as a lie. It may not he known to
our readers that a reward of £lOOO is still available
for the finder of Leichhardt’s remains, and this,
doubtless, excites the cupidity of those with whom
not even a dead hero’s memory is sacred. It is
apparently sacred enough to the colonial Govern-
ments, else long ere this Leichhardt had slept la
consecrated ground and;a four-storied monument
marked the fact that his deeds lived after him.
But:—
Sleep, Leichhardt, sleep,
Though but the savage knows
Thy resting place, in lonely forest wild?
Sleep long and deep;
Naught may mar thy repose
In winter drear, or Austral’s spring time
mild.
The wild flowers bloom—
The wonga’s whirring wing- -
The curlews’ moan through all the lonely
night
Above thy tomb
Are requiems which a king,
The highest state, could never claim as right.
Adieu, brave heart I
Perchance forgot by men:
What matter so ? Thy life of care is past.
May better part
Be thine when Memory’s pen
Does justice to thy gallant name at last.
THE GERM THEORY.
Probably no discovery in the history of discovery,
has been fraugnt with more beneficial result than
'that which is popularly Known as the germ theory.
Kirchner, Schwa n, Hemholtz, Koch, Pasteur,
Budd, Huxley, Lister, Sanderson, Carpenter, Tyn-
dall, and Bastian have sff.wn us that in the midst
of life, indeee, we are in death. The air we breathe,
the water we drink, teems with minute organisms
termed bacteria—active agents in the worn of
putrifaction. Huxley, in his course upon “ Dust
and Disease,” proved the organic origin of the
motes floating in London air, which are revealed
by their reflecting and scattering the light of a
beam of sunshine or electric light. When these
motes are burnt or intercepted, darkness is pro-
duced in the beam, the air being then rendered
optically pure. Germs, then, are never absent
from the conditions of our lives, unless under the
application of heat, or, in a minor degree, of fil-
tration. It is obvious, therefore, that it should
be our care to keep the air we breathe and tho
water we drink as free as possible from the con-
tamination of life germs, whose putrescent action
is the cause of disease. To do this it is incumbent
upon us to keep our dwellings and surroundings
free from those influences in which arise the
germs of disease. This however, is at all times
difficult to accomplish; and it is a curious circum-
stance, not as yet explained by scientific investiga-
tion, that disease is by no means the scourge only
of those who live amidst surroundings of tilth and
squalor. On the contrary, it is often found that
epidemics are most severe in their action among
the well-to-do and refined classes of society. The
Jews of the Ghetto, and the denizens of St Giles,
were not those who suffered moat severely during
the periodical epidemics of cholera within the past
eighty years. Observing this, it is impossible to
escape the conclusion tnat the rude force of con-
stitution which enabled those people to resist the
influence of disease arose in their comparative
purity of blood. Hard fare and hard work are tho
natural conditions under which sound health is
secured, and the physiologic conclusion is that the
germ basis of disease is comparatively harmless in
its action upontnose whose physical fauctions and
bodily systemare sound and healthy. This acknow-
ledged, we are compelled to me conclusion that
the first and most important factor in any system
of resistance to disease, resides lu securing purny
of blood. Tnat attained, all theorgans of thebody
become healtny, and diseases which sMke down
the weak and feeble are powerless to harm those
who have restored to themselves the conditions of
a natural exigence.
How to accomplish this end is, then, an all im-
portant question. But it Is readily answered.
Science, while alert to trace the origin of disease,
is no Jess ceaseless m her efforts to discover pre-
ventives and curatives. And just as the skilful
farmer, by the application of those phosphates
which have been exhausted, restores to land weak-
ened by incessant croppings, the elements which
have been withdrawn from it, so the chemist
supplies those restorative agents which give back
to the human system the strength and force which
haxe been wasted. This fact is beautifully lllus-
tratrated in Warner’s safe cure. In Europe and
America there are many thousands now alive who
owe this agreeable circumstance to the use of this
specific, wnen attacked with Typhoid and analog-
ous diseases. The direct influence of this renowned
medicine is upon the blood which is restored to its
original purity, and purged from all poisonous and
debilitating matter. Thus, in all conditions of mal-
aria, typhoid, scarlet fever, as well as when the
system is weakened by Bright’s disease, ordinary
kidney or urinary affections, disorders of the liver
and so forth, a resort to Warner’s safe cure is al-
ways attended with good results. This is because
the blood is purified and fortified by the assimila-
tion of such restorative agents as nature has bene-
ficially provided. In view of the prevalence ot
Typhoid is these colonies at the present time, it is
necessary to impresi upon the public intelligence
the brief facts we have referred to! Tq be armed
against the germs of disease it is necessary to purity
the blood; to do this it is only needful to do that
which we have indicated, and attend to those or-
dinary hygienic and sanitary rules which suggest
themselves to every thoughtful person.
