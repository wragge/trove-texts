"THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
‘‘Tlae Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis-
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education,
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System—one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present ;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency,
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility, ’
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless news paper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned- with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress; it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not befen granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff. .
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red coveris equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the"pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maori land
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

Who is trebly-qualified and registered in London
and the Colonies, as a Physician and Surgeon,
received his Medical Education in the English
and _ Scottish Universities, and completed his
studies in the leading hospitals of Europe. He
has made a life-long study of
Private, Nervous
AND
SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
Origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period
of many years, obtained the highest position in
his profession. The various diseases embraced in
his speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
YOTJKTG- OXdCEIV

more matured age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely :--Frequent headaches;
giddiness; drowsiness in the day time; irregu-
larity of the bowels; feeling of fullness after eat-
ing ; specks floating before the eyes; halos or circles
round a candle; cold hands and feet; pains in the
back, or under the shoulder-blade; tenderness

skin diseases may be quickly ans permanently

restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
that has lost all hope.

DEBILITY,
and should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above Do Not Delay.

reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly in
the privacy of your chamber and write out a full
description of your case, and send it by post.
D Ft. GIBBONS

opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send 6d. in

A man was recently fined, at Rochester
(Eng.), for dragging a quantity of hair out of his
wife’s head. Plaintiff appeared with the hair in
her hand. Said the defendant: “That hair she
is showing you has been in the family for genera-
tions. She brought it with her when she sum-
moned me five years ago. My father was fined
for pulling it out, and so was my grandfather.
That hair’s a dashed hairloom, yer washup.” But
jt was no use.
Dear Bulletin, — That yarn about a death-
adder suiciding at Warren, N.S.W., with its
“sting” is bushman’s bunkum, and poor stuff even
at that. The boozy, Bathurst-burr-besieged town-
ship of Warren is just the sort of place I’d expect
to hear of a death-adder with a “sting” in its
tail being found, and a man named M'Ginnis is
just the sort of person (be kroipes) that I’d expect
to make the “discovery.” They want a little
more sense up Warren way and a little less
M'Ginnis. The Warren Herald man has been
clumsily and vulgarly hoaxed. This vulgar, irra-
tional superstition regarding an Australian snake
so well-known as our death-adder (Acanthophis
antarctica) makes one feel ill, for 10 years ago
all intelligent Australians frankly admitted
that I had stamped it out. M'Ginnis’s
stupid yarn is only another instance of the
fact that concerning all questions of Australian
natural science the bushman of to-day is as
ignorant as the bushman of 60 years ago.
M'Ginnis out-Ginnises himself in imagining that
the bite —much less the “sting”—of Acanthophis
antarctica would kill itself. If one death adder
bit and injected all its poison into another it
would in no way harm it. No venomous snake
can kill itself or one of its own species with its
poison—times out of number I have proved this.
I don’t believe that the death-adder at Warren
committed suicide, and I don't believe that any
“ post-mortem examination” was held on its body.
In fact, 1 don’t believe there was any death-adder
there at all; but I do believe, firmly and con-
scientiously, that there is somewhere in N.S.W.
a place called Warren and a person named
M'Ginnis. —Yours, &c., H. J. M ‘Cooky.

We recommend these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day ; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
Eor General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,

The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
x J ersons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. Eor
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Liver.
See what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.

excellent, and superior to many others that I have

Baron Berzilins’——
- --Bnchu Bitters,
BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinary
Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid Irrita-
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from
the lo°s cf tone in the parts concerned in its evacuation.
These Bitters I also recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chrordo
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.

STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen:—
Statutory Declaration,
“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare as follows:
‘ ‘ That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and haye been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,

Row’s You’ll Do Bitters.
All who suffer from Chest Complaints, Cold, Coughs,
and general weakness of the Lungs, will gain more ease
and comfort from a wineglass of HOW’S YOU’LL DO
BITTERS than any cough medicine tried before.
Read what Medical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D.: —The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in oases
of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D.—BBBB—I find these Bitters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. I therefore thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D.—lt is the purest of Bitters, and
exerts a peculiar influence over the liver.
Row’s Pepsine Bitters.
All who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon

At the Stage Door.
(BY PATCH[?]TT MARTIN)
Beg pardon, Miss—are you the star
We hear so much of, near and far ;
Eh ? Deg your pardon—oh, you are ?
And who am I? Well, p’raps you’ll deign
To pause and glance at me again ?
What’s that ? You think that I’m insane r
Ah no I Not even seven years’ space
Can from my memory quite efface
Your lustrous eyes and queenly grace.
'Tis strange that we should thus have met.
But not that you should thus forget
A long-since vanished amourette.
I, who was then a brilliant beau,
Might be a model now for “Woe
See, from my boot obtrudes ray toe.
While you, as in the days of old.
Have silken dresses, rings of gold,
And are so charming to behold !
Pray, don't turn pale, and wherefore start?
What though we both pledged hand and heart
You’ve played throughout a splendid part.
Scene I.—“Betrothed”—one moment, Miss,
'Twas these parched lips received the kiss
That was to herald life-long bliss.
But when the wished-for day drew near,
There came a certain wealthy peer,
Whose smile was like a satyr’s leer.
I saw him kiss you on the cheek,
And in a fit of foolish pique
Sailed for Australia that same week.
I doubt not he admired your charms,
And clasped you in his wrinkled arms,
While diamonds stilled cold Virtue’s qualms.
But meantime in Crimean shirt
I digged, to find ’midst clayey dirt,
The metal that did all the hurt.
Then for a while the curtain falls;
It rises, when on Melbourne walla
I see your name in capitals !
And so again we chance to meet
Here by the stage-door in the street;
A meeting after years—how sweet 1
But tell me all the story, pray:
Was he, then, poor as well as grey 7
Or—did his lordship run away f
Some other day, perhaps, you’ll tell;
You now await the prompter’s bell—
I recollect stage business well.
Adieu ! and should I ever chance
To write a drama or romance,
I need not filch my plot from France.

The Prohibition movement is assuming
awful proportions in Maoriland. It is no longer a
campaign against drink, but against the indivi-
dual drinker. In the smaller towns the move-
ment has an eye on everybody, and if it considers
that any person’s nose is too vividly illustrated,
or his breath is not up to sample, some reverend
person calls upon him. Then, having leaned his
black umbrella against the door post, he extracts
with his black-gloved hand a note-book from the
tail-pocket of his black coat, and asks him
what he drinks. While he is waiting for an
answer he fishes out a pencil from his black
waistcoat and stands ready to enter the name of
the drink in his book. If the information is not
satisfactory he most likely calls on the woman
next door and asks if the suspected person is ever
seen intoxicated, if anyone has noticed his breath,
if he looks wild on Saturday nights, if he comes
home late and has a difficulty with his keyhole, if
he swears or makes a disturbance, if he is ever
seen bringing home drink, and various other ques-
tions. He notes down all the answers, and
demands whether the interrogated female’s own
husband is strictly sober, and whether she has any
suspicions concerning anybody else in the neighbour-
hood. Then he goes round to the back and looks
over the fence to see if there are bottles lying
about.

SATURDAY, MARCH 17, 1894.
The Social Scavenger.
Last week, his Honor Chief Justice Darley,
of New South Wales, in giving his decision
in the Tb Kloot divorce-case, took the
opportunity to make sundry trenchant
remarks concerning that social scavenger, the
private detective. The Tb Kloot case was
like many others of its kind. It was the
story of a young husband and a young wife
in comparatively humble circumstances, and
an elderly and obscene admirer of reputed
affluence and considerable social status. The
husband grew suspicious, and being unable
to satisfy himself as to the doings of his wife
and her elderly admirer, and it being
necessary, in any case, to get corroborative
evidence before the law would grant him
redress, he employed a private detective
to watch the proceedings of the pair. This
person assumed a horizontal attitude at the
back of the house, and through a gimlet hole
he saw sundry unpublishable doings which he
afterwards retailed in court. He, presum-
ably, couldn’t well help retailing them,
being sworn to tell the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, and as the Court
granted a decree nisi on his evidence
there was plainly no serious doubt as to
his veracity. Nevertheless, Judge Darley
went somewhat out of his way to load the
detective with opprobrium, and heaped on
him many abusive adjectives. According to
his Honor’s comprehensive vocabulary, as
reported in the daily press, the miserable
testifier was “unmanly,” “brutal,” “con-
temptible,” “ cowardly,” “ disgusting,”
“wicked,” and many other things, and
inferentially he was, in a general way, brother
to the pariah dog and the hyena, and first-
cousin to the earth-worm, and uncle to the
crow that feeds on the decayed bullock out
in the Never-Never.
* * #
Judge Barley’s state of mind on this
occasion is an interesting study. The evi-
dence of the garbage-hunting witness was so
strongly corroborated that its accuracy was
hardly even called in question. Therefore,
the Judge, to all intents and purposes,
abused him, not because he was necessarily
dirty by instinct, but because the truth which
he told was dirty. He was practically abusing
the truth, which is as ineffective and as
foolish as throwing stones at the solar
system. But the truth, as it happens, is
generally dirty, and Mr. Darley, who is
paid £3500 a year to listen to dirty truths
and weigh one unclean verity against another,
should, at least, be aware of this fact.
Moreover, strangely enough, all his copious
flow of language was reserved for the person
who saw certain obscene facts ; concerning
the people who did them his criticisms were
milk-and-watery by comparison. The well-
connected gentleman inside the house who
perpetrated the especially objectionable sin
escapes without one very violent adjective,
but the man of no social standing outside
the house, who was merely a witness of his
conduct, gets the full blast of his Honor’s
copious objurgation. This looks like a
serious discrepancy. If the truth is to pre-
vail, as it is supposed to do in law-courts,
then so long as there are men, either of
good social standing or otherwise, who
habitually do unlawful acts, there must
be other men whose business it is to
watch them through any available orifice,
and afterwards explain the circumstances
to a sensitive and hypercritical Judge.
This witness was blasted by a profuse and
fluent legal dignitary for discovering an
especially disgusting crime, and the only
possible inference is that he shouldn’t have
discovered it. And if he shouldn’t have dis-
covered it, then, presumably, no other man
should either, under penalty of similar
reproach. From which it naturally appears
that because the offence was disgusting it
shouldn’t have been discovered at all, and,
according to his Honor’s logic, it is only
necessary, in a well-ordered and ideal com-
munity, for an offender to be sufficiently
offensive to be secured from legal interference
altogether.
Judge Darley, while furiously denouncing
what was done in this case, strangely enough
altogether omitted to explain what ought to
have been done. This is another serious
discrepancy, and he is therefore invited to
consider the following alternatives. In the
first place, Tb Kloot might have put up
with his wife’s infidelity, and become thereby
a tame accomplice in his own dishonour. In
the second place, he might have done his
own detective business, and told the un-
wholesome tale of the elderly and well-
connected admirer himself without any
corroboration. In this case the abuse which
was levelled at the detective would probably
have been levelled at the husband instead ;
and then, having no independent evidence
and being strongly contradicted by his wife
(who, as a nurse, was, it would be argued,
colorably privileged to comport herself off-
handedly with men) and her elderly and
purely benevolent “protector,” who was also
colorably privileged by reason of his age, he
might possibly have found himself landed in
gaol for aggravated perjury. Or, if he escaped
this danger, he would assuredly have had his
faithless wife fixed on him for life, and
would probably have been gaoled for in-
ability to pay her paramour’s costs, and when
he got over this difficulty—if he ever did get
over it—he would have been gaoled again
for inability to pay maintenance money.
Or, as yet another alternative, he might
have taken the law into his own hands and
shot his wife’s seducer, whereupon he
might possibly have been sent to the
gallows, or to a long term of penal servitude.
Failing these alternatives the only avail-
able course was to set a watch on the guilty
pair, in which instance the choice lay
between a detective who would do the
work as a matter of business, and some
loathsome amateur who would do it as a
matter of pleasure and inherent brutality.
In either case the watcher could not know
what he would witness—perhaps if he had
foreseen the exceedingly unpleasant habits
of the well-connected gentleman even the
private detective would have refused the job.
But, having witnessed his habits, the oath
administered by Judge Barley’s Court com-
pelled him to explain them, and then the
cataclysm promptly followed.
• • #
The language of the Bench in this instance
would almost suggest—if such verdant inno-
cence were possible in an experienced lawyer
—that Mr. Darley imagines the detective
business to be, in the main, a clean, upright,
and soul-refining calling. If this is so, the
sooner he dismisses the idea the better. The
detective, whether private or official, is the
necessary hired spy and informer of civilisa-
tion. He is by profession a heartless liar ; a
detective who told the truth on all occasions
would be utterly valueless, for he would
detect nothing. He is a man who
looks through keyholes and windows and
peeps secretly round half-open doors at
all manner of loathsome sights, and takes
notes of loathsome language, and habitually
consorts, in the course of business, with
prostitutes, thieves, adulterers, and all the
other unpleasant scrap-ends of humanity,
and like the Serpent he has to pursue his
calling on his stomach all the days of his
life. It is only at rare intervals that he has
to describe these horrors in detail before a
fastidious Judge, but when the occasion
requires he does it with the nonchalance
born of long acquaintance with the miry by-
ways of life. But whether he is called upon
to describe them or not he has to know
them. He has to be all the insulting adjec-
tives which Judge Darley heaved at the
witness in the Tb Kloot divorce-case, and
failing that, crime would so effectually get
the upper hand of justice that Mr. Dar-
ley’s own person would presently not be safe
when he walked , the streets at noon-day.
But even if Tb Kloot’s minion was many
degrees worse than the average detective—
which he wasn’t, and quite deserved all the
language thrown at him—which he surely
didn’t, it ill became anybody in Mr. Darlby’s
position to make such comments. The Chief
Justice is the principal representative of the
law, and the law’s visible embodiments are
the hangman, who cold-bloodedly butchers
men for money, and the flogger, who cold-
bloodedly tortures men for money, and the
gaol-turnkey, and the man who humps away
the body after the execution; and, therefore,
the Judge is a purveyor of human meat for
the executioner and an official colleague of
the strangler. So, too, is his official brother,
the detective.
* ♦ *
A few other side issues of the Tb Kloot
case are equally remarkable. In his sum-
ming-up, Judge Darley almost hinted that
the plaintiff was an accomplice (innocent or
guilty) in his wife's dishonour because
“ when he received permanent employment
at £3 a week he declined to allow respondent
to have a servant, although he must have
known that one in the house would have been
an additional safeguard to his honour while he
was absent in the evenings.” Probably this
copious Judge never tried the experiment of
maintaining a family and paying a servant
on the princely salary of 60s. per week!
And, as a still more remarkable circumstance,
the jury recommended, and Mr. Darley
cordially endorsed the recommendation, that
the £2OOO damages awarded against the
elderly seducer should be settled on the
faithless wife and her child. So far as concerns
the child there is no objection to be made,
but the rest of the proposition forms an
interesting commentary on the wondrous
illogicalness of the law. Tb Kloot loses his
wife, his home, and presumably his happi-
ness, and his name is dragged through the
mire of the divorce-court, all through his
wife’s doing. Also he loses an amount of
money which, to a man in his position, is
practically ruinous, for though the Judge
went through the empty form of awarding
costs, these, The Bulletin presumes, are
costs of court only, according to the
invariable rule, and all the other ex-
penses, which form about three-fourths of
the whole bill, have to be borne by the
injured plaintiff himself. Further, if the
respectable seducer should by any chance
prove insolvent, Tb Kloot is responsible
for all his wife’s costs also, and can
be sent to gaol for inability to pay. And,
in consideration of all these things, he
gets absolutely nothing, while his faithless
wife gets £2OOO, which is equal to about
£lOO per annum—in fact, is paid £2OOO for
her faithlessness, for the money is forth-
coming solely because of these same acts of
infidelity, which were so offensive to a
refined intelligence that the miserable detec-
tive was fiercely anathematised for even
mentioning them in court. The ways of the
law are indeed mysterious.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Thin Issue.
That portion of the “Davies scandal” which
had become identified with the Mercantile
Bank’s final balance-sheet was disposed of last
week by a jury’s acquittal of the three de-
fendants— Davies, Millidge and Muntz—
charged with wilful intent to deceive the public.
It is now definitely decided, legally, that
nobody did deliberately “ cook ” the much-
debated balance-sheet in question. The sheet
was misleading, but the people responsible for
its appearance were guiltless of meaning anv
harm. Furthermore, the law has left in doubt
the question as to who was responsible, a matter
of small consequence, seeing that everything
was quite right. The decision in this case
justifies a number of other balance-sheets of
other banks that have suspended payment, or
gone utterly bung, at such times as they
were said to be beyond suspicion—which is
eminently soothing to the banking world.
As regards the Mercantile balance-sheet, there
were a few specially peculiar circumstances.
A loan of £IOO,OOO from another institution, a
loan hastily obtained to “strengthen” the cash
and coin reserve, was described as a “satis-
factory increase in deposits,” by which one
might suppose that the public were showing
their confidence in the Mercantile rather more
than usual. There was also a little matter of
obtaining £40,000 from a London bank in a wav
described by the London bank as “ doctoring
the accounts.” Twelve jurymen agreed to find
no criminality in these “test” transactions,
however, and as a legal curtain has been drawn
over the rest of the Mercantile Bank’s business,
the acquittal followed, as a matter of course.
Australia, for a long time sick of the miserable
legal points and solemn absurdities attaching
to this balance-sheet case, is glad to have
the farce terminated. Even as the flowers
of spring had nothing to do witli Ko-Ko’s mar-
riage to Katisha, so was this bald synopsis of
book balances irrelevant to the question of
Daviesian companies in general. Mention of
“ the tentacles ” was tabooed by the Judge,
because they had no bearing on the legal
honesty of this particular sheet. In short, the
case against Matthew Davies, as the public
have always understood it, was not under dis-
cussion at all. Nor did the question of
the possibility of Millidge and others
having known aught about the bad debts
for which no provision was marie, come before
the jury. 'The trial that ended last week
was strictly “ narrowed down,” and the
broad principles of honesty and fair dealing
had no chance to enter into it. The Mercantile
Bank came to grief through the investment of
its depositors’ money in rotten speculations,
but even the legal rightness or wrongness of
such investment remains unsettled. Does the
“ scandal ’’ end here ?
Dear Bulletin, —In Albert-street, Brisbane,
the other night, I heard a policeman accost a
young woman with an insulting question. She
gave him a sharp answer, and he arrest ed her.
At the court next morning it was shbwn that,
although once she bore a bad character, she
had reformed, and was leading a respectable
life. Hence her anger at the policeman’s ques-
tion. The Bench dismissed the case. As I
took an interest in the matter, being an eye-
witness, I made enquiries, and the girl stated
that while in the cell for the night an official
brutally assaulted her. Her body next day
was black and blue. It is well-known here
that girls in the lock-ups have no protection
whatever, and, from time to time, endure
frightful abuse at the hands of the police. They
say it is no use complaining to higher officials,
as they are not listened to. —Yours, R. D.
White.
[This is only one of a series of similar complaints, which
have sufficient foundation to be a disgrace to Queensland.
In consequence of the scandal of the thiiiff' a p. in ion
praying for the appointment of a female warder to ( . ke
charge of female prisoners was not long since present' d
to the Government and—shelved. It is a burning shame
to Ministers with wives and daughters of their own that
for the sake of a paltry economy they permit street unfor-
tunates to be the prey, or alleged p ey, of the conslanu-
lary. The police in many Australian gnols and lock ups
have far too much power over the wretched fem.de
prisoners.—Ed. B.]
Thanks to Sam. Griffith’s backsliding, North
Queensland is rapidly becoming the happy
home of all shades of black, brown, and yellow
coolies. At Thursday Island recently the
Japanese held a meeting, with a Japanese law-
yer presiding, to settle the Japanese unem-
ployed question ; and telegraphed to Cairns and
Mackay offering the services of 60 Japanese for
plantation work, pearling being slack. At a
single Cairns Police Court trial the witnesses
included a Cingalese, who was sworn on a book
of Buddha ; a Malay, who preferred the
Koran; and several Chinese, who blew out
matches. At Geraldton, where there is a motley
population of Javanese, Chinese and Malays,
Miss Margaret Lyons, sister of the Geraldton
schoolmaster, was last month brutally outraged
and murdered. There is no doubt that the
crime was committed by some of the sugar-
plantation labourers, near whose camps she
passed, and three Javanese are in custody.
.The planters take such matters cheerfully.
“Only the scum of the sugar industry,” they
say ; “ and you can’t boil sugar without getting
scum.” Well, there were white men in N.Q.
once. The Bulletin fears the breed is degene-
rating.

At latest, there were 81 ex-New Australians
stranded at the lonesome Paraguayan town of
Villa Rica, and considering ways and means of
getting back to Old Australia. Some of these

pelled. Single men who leave the settlement
receive £4 16s. ; married couples get £6 5s.
each, and £3 2s. 6d. for each child. This
amount probably represents their full share of
the common fund, or what remains of it, for
there is very little left out of £60 after paying
a passage to South America and other expenses:
but it is a most melancholy sum to be stranded
with in an unknown land. Plainly, Aus-
tralia will have to provide the funds for
bringing back such of these wanderers as desire
to return. At present the British Government is
moving in the matter, but the great majority of
Australians have very little reverence for the
British Government in days of prosperity, and
it is a gruesome commentary on Australian
national sentiment that this country should
leave its lost citizens to fall back on the
Imperial authorities in times of adversity. If
Australia allows the stranded Paraguayan
emigrants to be returned at the cost of the
British Treasury, this country will have a fair
claim to be regarded as the meanest one on
earth. Australia can’t profess nationalism and
accept charity from Britain at one and the same
time with any semblance of public decency.
The alleged “ poverty ” of Matthew Davies,
James Munro, and many another fallen boomer
is given, again and again, as a reason why the
world should consider them unfortunate and
swear by their integrity. Also, it is sometimes
accepted as a sound reason. Fat Man never
misses a chance to plead the present as an
apology for the past. Every blessed creature
who has filed his schedule will tell you that the
gamblers of five years ago ought to be objects
of honest sympathy, because they caifit gamble
any more. In Davies’ case, the fact that he

MuNRO, being a teetotaller, his want of the funds
iiAoessarv to a sparkling champagne existence
is not so much pitied, but, otherwise, the
reduced circumstances of that misguided old
person excite sorrowful comment in religious
circles. It can’t be too often pointed out that
Davies and Mdnro, and the like of them,
never did much to merit wealth at any time.
That they were not clever men is certain.
As'boomers and dealers with other people’s
money, they were bad examples to legitimate
industry in their “prosperous” times. The
moral effect of their apparent success was
disastrous. They never dreamed of anything
better than an impossible suppiy of small land-
buyers, who would take over, at enormously
increased prices, the land which Davies and
MuNRO had bought on a dim, mysterious system
of bank “tick.” A miracle might have kept
the Melbourne land-boom going for years, in
which case Davies and Mdnro would have
absorbed tens of millions. They gambled to
win tens of millions, and when the game was
lost, it transpired that the public had to pay
for their fun. The fool who puts his own little
fortune on a horse, and “ goes broke ” in conse-
quence, is deserving of a public subscription if
these exploded bank-promoters deserve one
sympathetic word.
Mr. MTlwraith, of MHlwraith, M'Eagharn
and Cos., last week visited Newcastle (N.S.W.),
and, in an interview with the local press,
appears to have made some wild statements
about Australian labour and British capital.
Among other things, he stated that, while in
Kngland lately, he found that the general im-
pression about Australia was that, though a
magnificent country, it was hopelessly and
irretrievably ruined for investors by labour-
troubles. As an instance of this (to use his
>wn alleged words) he said that a powerful
English syndicate was formed a short time ago
to develops the New South Wales iron industry,
and their agent (though unable to find good
ironstone where it was reported to exist) dis-
covered in another locality immense deposits of
ore far exceeding in extent and richness any
yet discovered in Great Britain, with deposits
of coal in the immediate vicinity. But on
account of the unfavourable reports received
from Australia about the labour troubles, the
syndicators (how haughty their disregard for
their own interests !) abandoned the enterprise.
This is anew phase of Bull’s commercial
activity, and when contrasted with his present
feverish haste in snapping up Australian
securities looks like a lie of the clumsiest fabri-
cation. It appears still thinner when it is
remembered that another English syndicate is
at present negotiating for the purchase of the
whole of the coal-mines in the New South
Wales northern district (the hot-bed of labour
disturbances) with a view of amalgamating
them into one large trust.
I eui Bulletin, —“Australia for the Austra-
lians,” a splendid motto, is occasionally used as
a cloak for hysterical outbursts of simulated
virtue. For instance, in Melb., the other day,
a Chinaman was legally married to a girl with
the mother’s consent and in her presence.
Forthwith a magistrate sent the girl to tiie
Reformatory Schools. Nothing has been done
to the Chinese husband, nor has the “ parson ”
been arrested for illegally marrying. Conse-
quently, the ceremony appears to have been
legally valid. Under what law is the bride
sent to what is practically a gaol ? And if this
procedure be right and just in the case
of a Chinaman, what happens when a girl
marries a suspected burglar with a white skin ?
Two girls, On the recommendation of a Rev.
Somebody, lodged with a Japanese and his wife.
The Japanese, unfortunately, bore the Celestial
cognomen of Goon Lee. The girls worked at a
tobacco factory, and even the police were
obliged to own that their characters were good.
Presently, the guardians of the peace swooped
down upon the habitation of Goon Lee, and
hauled his fair lodgers before the Bench as
“ vagrants.” Evidence of their earning weekly
wages, and never having done anything more
heinous than board with an alien laundryman,
was blissfully waived from consideration, and
they were pitchforked into the Reformatory.
The papers duly vilified Goon Lee for no
earthly reason whatever, he being, it would
appear, one of the few really decent Chinese-
Japanese occupants of the city, and a smoky
supposition remains that something or other,
connected with aliens and Asiatics, has been
vindicated.—B.E. Melb., 3rd Feb., ’94.

The S.A. National Mule:—
A tax . on absentees as such is unconstitutional in cases
wnere the absentees have no parliamentary vote, because
is taxation without representation, which is a British
an vject s birthright, and cannot be taken from him with-
out Ins consent.
1 ruly, there is no rest for the old dead wheeze,
even in the grave. The principle of no taxa-
tion without representation isn’t a British sub-
ject s birthright; it never was, and, if the Tory
Party and the Unnatural Ass can manage it, it
never will be. A good deal more than 90 per
eeut. of British subjects are taxed without
even a semblance of representation. To begin
Wlt '> nearly 290,000,000 subjects in India
are not represented in Parliament in any way,
ut they are taxed all the same. A good many
million assorted niggers in Africa are in the
same situation. The people, white and coloured,
et all the Crown colonies are likewise, and
mre are several scores of these colonies
scattered over the map. And even of those
ragments of the empire which have a constitu-
lonal Parliament, in all except Maoriland and
, e bsle of Man the female “ subject,”
w io constitutes more than half the popula-
-10n > 18 taxed without representation, and a
pretty large and solid proportion of the male
n la bitants are disqualified in one way or
another, though the tax-gatherer gets at them,
irougfi customs, excise, and other duties, with
ie utmost regularity. Taking the empire all
rough, it is a question if quite four per cent,
tax-payers are “ represented,” nevertheless
ie good, old, cant phrase blooms in the vocabu-
ary of the National Ass with all its pristine
vigour. It was a lie from the beginning; it is
a lie still; it will keep on being a lie, appar-
ently, to the end ; it was never intended to be
anything but a lie, and an especially brazen lie
at that; and yet the average “subject” be-
lieves in it with a childlike faith and knows no
better.
In most speeches on the unemployed question
the speaker holds up “ the honest man ” as an
example of the bane 'of want of work. Even
Cardinal Moran lately referred to what he
called the claim of the “ honest, honourable
men ”to labour. But who are the honest men?
If a man wants work he has an equal claim
with all men just as, being alive, he has a
claim upon life. It is sheer cant to say that
it is only the honest men who have a claim
upon labour, for nobody can say who the
honest man is. Cardinal Moran might regard
him as the man who “attended his religious
duties ” regularly ; or he might call him any
man of unblemished reputation. If these are
the only men who have a claim upon labour,
people must not be shocked to hear men of
shady reputation lay a claim upon crime ; for,
deprived of their claim upon labour, they never-
theless have bodies and souls to be kept together
and must either accept charity or steal. Being
disqualified for labour, they are justified in
theft. Bat the law does not allow them that
privilege ; hence, if they want to keep clear of
the law, they must work. A man shows his
good intentions by wanting work. Cardinal
Moran will be praying next for all honest men
and leaving the dishonest men to the Devil, as
he is leaving him to the unemployed fiend—
which is the Devil. There must in this regard
be no distinction among the unemployed— all
men must have a claim to labour, inasmuch as
it is the unemployed question that has much to
do with men being dishonest.
In the progress of city milk from cow to con-
sumer, the cow earns, and the consumer pays,
three distinct profits. The cow, of course, gets
no profit. She has a lot of sour grass while she
lives, if her lower jaw works assiduously; and,
when she dies, a sumptuous funeral in the
stomachs of roast-veal restaurant patrons.
Nevertheless, the cow is an item in the calcula-
tion ; since, next to the creek, she is the chief
source of the milk. After the cow comes the
farmer, who robs the calf, milks the cow,
empties the creek, and sells the product to a
big milk concern for 3d. a gallon. Then
the big milk concern provides horses and
carts for which it charges 355. a week
rent, and sells the milk to a milkman for
fid. a gallon. Then the milkman advertises
immense reductions, and sells the milk to the
consumer for Is. a gallon, or 3d. a quart. Thus
the milk, in travelling from fanner to con-
sumer, is charged with 390 per cent, increase
on the farmer’s price. Distribution costs three
times as much as production ; and the middle-
man cheerfully pockets three-fourths of the
value of the milk. Some of these days a farm-
ing genius may arise to introduce in Australia
the system of Southern Europe, and drive his
own cows to be milked at the customers’ doors
morning and evening. Then the consumer will
get his supply cheaply and directly, and know
it is as pure as udders can make it; while
farmer and cow will work together to their
joint profit, instead of being jointly exploited
by the parasites of industry.
Trials of endurance, or of strength, or races,
between alcoholisers and teetotallers, vege-
tarians and caruivorarians, &c., &c., are just
about as useless, as matters of test comparison,
as would be contests between swallows and
sharks. In every contest everything depends
upon the man himself. Were it possible to get
two men of exactly the same height, breadth,
tenacity of fibre, lung-capacity, &c., &c., breed
them for (say) 20 years in the same climate and
under exactly the same conditions of physical
exercise, &c. —keeping as the only variant the
one essential to be tested, such as the exclusion
of meat or of grog —then a trial of strength or
endurance between two such impossibilities
mitjht mean something ; on the other hand, it
might not, for a sudden sprain, strain, chill,
or change of mood even, might create a
handicap to the advantage of one. The
fancy tests brought about by the various
showmen on either side are mere amusing
gambles, of no value whatever in the settlement
of the physical questions involved. The latter
can only be approximated, and the approxima-
tions can only be teased out by generalisations
of the results of experiments conducted on a
large scale. What man does not know half-a-
dozen others who can do 50 per cent, extra
work with their interiors painted with alcohol;
andauother half-a-dozen who“never feel better”
than when they “ knock it off entirely?” The
human individual varies as much in respect of
his physical powers as he does in respect of the
lines on his palms—only more so. And whisky-
drinking and meat-eating have nothing what-
ever to do with the variation, but only concern
the individual.

Brewer Bass, created Lord Burton eight years
ago in consideration of his allegiance to Glad-
stone’s Irish policy, has formally renounced the
faith of his untitled self, and joined the
Unionist party in the House of Lords. One
more argument for the abolition of the House
aforesaid. Asa rule, the men promoted by
Gladstone to “another place” don’t wait
eight years before ceasing to lick the hand that
fed them. They declare themselves in their
true characters without letting a decent time
elapse, after the manner of a widow changing
her name ere the grass grows green over Late
Lamented, Esq. And these are, perhaps, a
little less despicable than the beer magnate
whose alleged “Liberal” principles trickle
away into the stream of Toryism, instead of
rushing thither like flood waters pouring
through a broken dyke. The thing has to be
done, and it is better done quickly. A commoner
coveting a peerage is a snob beyond question.
A true snob echoes the sentiments of the
Sovereign, and the Sovereign is the symbol of
Toryism. Even as every Australian knight is
the enemy of Republican doctrines, so is every
British peer an inevitable opponent of all
schemes that make for liberty. Those dis-
honest publications, the constitutional news-
papers, have set up a bogus distinction between
Tory peers and “ Liberal ” peers, and have gone
so far in humbug as to talk about “Radical”
peers. There is but one brand of peer, and the
newer his title the more evident his brand.
Gladstone himself being merely a Tory in a
mild form, he has, on most questions, a follow-
ing among the Lords. When (if ever) a Demo-
cratic Government starts operations in England
the Peers will oppose it in a solid body, and the
mob will probably rush the Upper Chamber one
afternoon and cast the pillars of the State into
the street.
A wayback correspondent:—
Editor Bulletin, —Aa you know, the N.S.W. Central
Division squatters are agitating for a renewal of their
leases. Most of the lessees are members of the Pastoralists’
Union, and the official organ of that association asserts
that fully 13,000 men will get < mployment, who are at
present walking about the bush, if the leas-s are ex-
t i ded. Throughout the Division wages ha\e been so
lowered that it is quite common to find able-bodied men
working on stations for 155., and even less, per week ; the
cause being, so His said, the insecurity of tenure. Surely
that is not a fair wage for any white man ! It is not as if
the squatting industry would not stand better wages. An
official declaration should he obtained from the Pas-
torabsts’ Union, that their members shall not pay a lower
wage than, say, £1 p r week in return for the extension
of their leases. If the Central Division squatters intend
to keep the present rate of pay going then I, for
one, would just as soon see anew race of men
take their places. Station-work, with the exception of
shearing, is the worst-paid of any in Australia, and the
extension of the leases is simply making a present of
big money to the lessees or their bankers. Station work
is not like most other employments. Once a man enters
that kind of life he is damned for all other work. There
is no prospect of a rise ; it is the same thing year after
year, in all weather—he has no chance of improving his
position. “ Abandon hope all ye who enter here ” should
be written large on the door of every station-hut, for
never did a sphere of toil afford so little chance of rising
from the ruck as station-life in Australia. The man who
lives in the hut knows that he will die in the hut; there is
no hope for him ; down he is and down he will remain till
the end.—Rouseabout, 20th Feb., ’94.
This is fche jubilee year of the Australian wine-
trade. In 1844, Captains Weston and Ogilvy,
who had learned something about grape treat-
ment during the Peninsular War, made a first
attempt to inspire the locals with a thirst for
pure wine from their vineyard on Parramatta-
road. The gallant captains placed a few hhds.
with Sizar Elliott, of Sydney, and he, after
bottling, labelling, and capsuling in smart
style, put the stuff on the market at 15s. a
dozen. The Gov. bought a case or two, and
sundry other official persons tried to give
the new industry a lift, but the general public
would have none of it. The wine, says Mr,
Elliott (he is still alive and hearty in Melb.),
was very good ; better than most of the grape-
juice offered for sale to-day, but people refused
to take it seriously. Had they then hailed the
vineyard idea, Australia might by this time have
become a mighty wine-growing and exporting
country, with millions of bottles of the native
article accumulating cobwebs in thousands of
private cellars, and a population proud of offer-
ing its friends a glass of good stuff —laid down
in the sixties or seventies. At present, how-
ever, Australia is a land of houses that don’t
possess cellars wherein to lay it down, and of
householders who continue to swill beer and
whisky, without regard for climatic considera-
tions, for the reason that beer and whisky are
great British institutions.
Fees to civil servants have been practically
abolished on the continent of Australia, though
there are some bad exceptions. But, as a rule,
if a man is fined, the fine goes into the revenue.
In Tasmania, it too often goes into the pocket of
the civil servant who levies the fine. The fee-
system flourishes there in unmitigated flagrancy.
The Crown-Solicitor, for example, gets his
salary, and he gets no man knows how much
more for doing precisely the work for which his
salary is paid. Scores of big and little officers
emulate the Crown-Solicitor, according to their
degree, and the public are taxed in gross to pay
them wages, and in detail to pay them fees.
Revolt has long simmered, and at last J. C.
Mitchell, a Tasmanian native, has come
forward to bell the official cat. The support
which he received was so instant and unanimous
that the public mind is evidently made up to
abolish the abuse. Premier Dobson’s feeble
extenuation should be another nail in the coffin
of his feeble Government.

Sydney Telegraph on the acquittal of Matthew
Davies and others :
The only satisfactory part in the entire history of the
case is that now the parties accused have at last had a
fair trial before a jury, where their social and political
position counted for no more than if they were ordinary
uninfluential members of the community. They have had
the benefit of the most skilful legal defence, and the case
has been conducted by one of the ablest Judges on the
Victorian bench. Beginning on February 19, and ter-
minating on March 7, the inquiry has been of the most
exhaustive character, and there is every reason to believe
that not a point on either side has been left undeveloped
by the counsel engaged in the case. The result is that
the jury find them not guilty, and upon that the accused
may be congratulated, because it acquits them absolutely
of the criminality which the public heretofore had been
tempted to affix to them. They can now honestly say
that, independent of friends at court, and despite their
social position and their political connections, they have
been able to go through the terrible ordeal with un-
blemished character.
The same paper next day ;
As the Judge pointed out, it was not a crime that the
directors knew little of the actual position of the bank ;
it was not a crime for the bank to pay an 8 per cent, divi-
dend out of profits with an apparent large surplus, when
a fortnight afterwards it stopped insolvent; it was no
crime tb borrow £IOO,OOO from another bank, with the
stipulation that it should not be re-lent, with the object
of swelling the bank’s cash; and in regard to the group
of so-called Davies companies, it was not a crime for
those companies to figure as holding extensive
amounts of uncalled capital, and to raise millions
of deposits and debentures on the strength of
that capital, when the bulk of such capital
really represented shares in the hands of a tew interested
people. It was no crime to transfer properties from one
of the group to another at ever-increasing valuations, and
to treat those increments as profits, and to declare large
dividends to those shareholders on the strength of them.
It was no crime that the public did not know how things
were managed. Each transaction received the formal
sanction of the board of directors appointed by the share-
holders, and was perfect in form and legality. Only it
would be well if practical legislation could provide against
such practices in the future, could protect the public from
such bogus profits, and could make directors answerable
to depositors, debenture holders, and shareholders for the
correctness of the statements made to them.

PROSPECTING.
There is some splendid country
Where slate and quartz abound
The ranges on the Nicholson I mean
I’ve fossicked every gully
And every hill around
But not a blooming colour have I seen.
I dollied stone from every reef
I worked and toiled in vain
There’s Gold there yet thats my Belief
But I am Hanged if I try it again.
My prospects there were none to bright
The whole place looked so s; d
With not a human being in sight
It nearly drove me mad.
I rode about with dish and bag
Likewise with pick and shovel
Untill my poor unfortunate nag
At times could scarcely travel.
So Bye Bye to the ranges
They’ll see this kid no more
I am going to try ray luck
Out further West
That was My Intention to
Go out there Before
But I thought this Barren
Country worth a test.

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney,
March 14, 1894.
My Dear Moorabinda—
Paraguay Lane can’t be a clever Moses or he
wouldn’t have ukased, during the maiden voyage
of the “Royal Tar,” that no woman should show
herself on deck after sunset. Of course nobody
took any notice of the ridiculous order, and Mr.
Lane, it is said, sulked in his cabin for the rest of
the trip. Yet the Lane programme was full of
sentiment and every Jack was to have his Jill.
Heaven watches over newspaper interests : the
burglar burgles mostly in the silly season. A
Sydney daily gratefully put into its account of a
recent suburban crow-bar episode a sketch of the
lady’s bedroom almost as it appeared on the
eventful evening, but not quite. There was the
virtuous couch certainly, but the heroine had
been carefully lifted out of it —probably by Mrs.
Grundy, The idea conveyed was that Bill Sikes
had bagged the lady along with the spoons and
forks.
Nobody has ever invented a good burglar-trap*
A well -to- do Sydney man whose assets
weigh on his mind o’ nights, always leaves an
abundance of “ doctored ” whisky on his dining-
table ere going to bed—just as the housewife puts
strong cheese into the mouse-trap. I fear that
will never save his silver, for the real burglar is
almost necessarily a teetotaller. Calculating
criminals can’t afford to get drunk; cheerful
potations are the privilege of honest folk. Witness
the teetotal saints and their land-jobs.
Some original people entertain their burglars.
Not long ago an Edgecliffe-road resident found
two strange men in his dining-room at 1 a.m.
“My good fellows,” he said coolly, “there’s
really nothing in the house worth bagging. Sup-
pose you stop and take a little supper with me in-
stead of invoicing the lumber. I promise to say
nothing of this visit.” The astonished house-
breakers were too surprised to do more than sit
meekly down to table while their host skirmished
for forage, ultimately discovering bread and
butter and a tin of tongues. The host’s efforts
to open the can were so hopeless that one of the
burglars arose and, witha polite “ Allow me,’’and
a professional turn of the wrist, whisked off the
top twinkling. The scene didn’t end with a
rush of constabulary. The visitors ate and went,
and tfie host held a candle for them as far as the
gate. There never is any thrilling denouement in
the true story.
One never knows how to take a woman. For
instance, I would never have anticipated that her
Worship Mayor Yates, of Onehunga (Maoriland),
would seek to introduce the cloture in her little
talking-shop, limiting orators to smin. for speak-
ing to a motion and 3min. for a reply. And yet
it’s a womanly-enough action when you come to
look into it. The feminine tongue is certainly
hung in the middle, and the sound of it is sweet
music to the owner, at least—but, then, I never
heard it said that women were fond of hearing
other people talk.
A Maoriland man writes me in a burlesquey
spirit to say that the women voters over there
gave an amusing performance on polling-day. It
was a novelty to be bailed up on the pavement by
decent women (the decency, I suppose, was the
novelty), most of them young and pretty into the
bargain, and recalling one’s bazaar-experiences.
The pretty women were diplomatically sent on to
the kerbstone to coax indifferent men into plump-
ing for Sftiith, while the back - number she-
suffragists were carefully shut up in committee-
rooms playing with red tape and blue pencils until
the poll was declared. My correspondent does
not say that picked companies of nice young men
with lovely moustaches and London Journal legs
were out in search of the women’s votes.
Regarded in a strictly fashionable light, Equal
Suffrage is a burst bubble all over Australia. In
Sydney one ladyship withdrew her countenance
from it for (many people thought) a merely
querulous reason, disguising the real one ; and
now in Brisbane a “society” lady washes her
hands of it altogether, because she objects to the
ridiculous notion of one-woman-one-vote—making
Jill as good as her “missis.”
Mind you, I don’t say that the Women’s Rights
movement may not actually benefit by becoming
a pariah among the fashionable fads of the day—
the only wonder is that it ever got a stylish
clientele considering that no Governor’s wife ever
officially recognised it. But smart people in
search of a young and healthy fad are cautioned
to steer clear of the Women’s Rights notion as
they would shy at the bottomless pit. From a
daring sort of parlour pastime Equal Suffrage has
got down to be a subject of heated discussion in
the kitchen, and though genuine partisans may
see more hope for the “ cause ” than ever, the
perfumed humbugs who originated the idea wish
they could exorcise the whole business. After all,
the society woman isn’t politically fit for much
higher things than Primrose-Leaguing, or to pass
a bill for the encouragement of fore-lock pulling
among the virtuous peasantry.
Lady Duff has sent out invitations for an Easter
ball at Govrnentouse, on 29th inst.—also for a
garden-party—to follow the ball, of course. The
sequence I want to see is a ball following a garden-
party, and then the visitors on the grass would
be quite sure they weren’t asked to simply make a
clean sweep of sandwiches. At one vice-regal
garden-party coming on the heels of a ball some-
body found a hairpin in a glass of jelly.
The first charity ball of the season will be the
brightly-promising dance to be held under vice-
regal patronage on 30th inst., in Paddington Town
Hall, in aid of the Orphanage of Mercy. Tickets
(65.) are obtainable from Mrs. Hotham, “Lans-
down,” Edgecliffe-road, Woollahra.
Apropos of nothing in particular, they are say-
ing down South that when you are pitchforked
into the high places of sassiety and your humble
relative departs this world, you prove yourself not
worth your society salt if you commit the error of
going into mourning for him or her. It leads to
such awful commiserations if yon do. “ Did I
ever meet your poor dear grandpa in sassiety, Lady
Snuffkins ?” says the sympathetic visitor. Where-
upon Lady Snuffkins says “No,” faintly, behind
a black-bordered handkerchief, and waits, in cold
horror, for the next question, which is generally
more to the point. All this is obviated by simply
begging the question when an unpresentable
relative “pegs out.” There is one Baratarian
mushroom “noble” who evidently follows this
golden rule, or else he began life as an only
orphan. Nobody ever saw that family turn out in
an inky cloak, good mother.
New fashions in manners land in Australia
from every mail-boat, and the very latest phase of
Anglophobia renders the patient unintelligible to
some plain people. You must have been ’Ome,
you know, to do it properly—that is, allude to
London airily as “town.” “I saw Pagliacci in
town,” is the very latest way of saying that you
sampled Leoncavallo in London. No person who
turns his trousers up round the hems on a dry
day and carries a shepherd’s crook to support his
tottering footsteps ever makes crude geographical
allusions to “ London ” nowadays—not in Aus-
tralia, anyhow.
Speaking of “town”—when you are taking a
flight to that classic village don’t, in a burst of
generosity, give your parrot or your poodle-dog
to your bosom friend as a keepsake—but rather
board out the blue monkey, or whatever the
animal is, until you return. For instance, a
Sydney society girl went ’Ome a while ago and
ere taking ship she made an impressive present
of her Skye-terrier to a gentleman friend. But
when she returned the other day the first thing
she did was to hunt up the man with the dog.
“ Oh, Mr. Blank, you’ll give me my doggie back,
won’t you ? They’re so fashionable in town !”
People who accept pets from vanishing ladies
and let themselves get fond of them—l mean the
pets—are advised to ponder over this item.
The attitude —I had almost written pose—of
N.S.W. Attorney-General Heydon over the dual-
bathing question reminds me of a nervous bather
getting into the water gingerly on a cold day. The
Bill allows bathing along the beaches, yet men,
women, and children mustn’t go all in together
like a shoal of herrings, but separately on the
familiar “ladies to the left’’plan—only that under
the new regime the barriers will be invisible, and
Miss Aphrodite will have to get used to critical
male spectators sizing her up along the beach.
And, after all, the invisible-barrier idea is a far
more discreet plan than the style of erecting a
groggy fence patched with jam-tins round the
ladies’ reserve, and encouraging—by mysteriously-
worded notice-boards —stray Paul Prys to seek
for cracks in the palings while Venus underneath
imagines herself almost as secure as in her own
bathroom by reason of the ferocious sign-boards
and doddering palings hereinbefore alluded to.
The men, it seems, are to bathe alone, and the
ladies are to have the care of the small fry. But
I don’t think children should be allowed to bathe
with their aged grandmothers, and so on—it
engenders that familiarity which doesn’t lead to
respect. A possible little Johnny may be only six,
but the shock that seizes him when he sees ma
take off her curly hair and hang it on a geebung
tree-spray and hide her shop teet'h in a crab-hole
preparatory to ducking herself, may make a cynic
of him ten years ahead.
From “neck to knee” is the latitude of the
N.S.W. bathing-dress according to Act of Parlia-
ment. (In my mind’s eye, Horatio, do I see, in a
dim, religious light, intensely “proper” Attorney-
General Heydon, cutting out the paper patterns
at Parliament House). But why women should
be obliged to carry more topsail when they’re
dipping than when they’re dancing or theatre-
going is difficult to understand, and I think this Lord
Chamberlain-ish style of regulating our bathing-
suits is distinctly against the Constitution, as
being an implied intimation to Victoria Regina
that her ideas of decency don’t correspond with
Heydonian modesty. The decollette corsage of
to-day is encouraged by Queen Victoria, and it is
probably only that fact which keeps our discreet
A.-G. from ukasing that from ear to heel is full
ball-dress in decorous N.S.W. However, royalty
doesn’t hold drawing-rooms on the sea, and there
is no marine precedent to stop the amateur censor
in his present gallop.
The Royal Agricultural Society holds a specially
magnificent Easter shivoo at Moore Park from
the 21st to the 27th inst. The grounds are to be
illuminated by electricity every evening and the
attention of “country visitors” is especially
directed to this fact, probably lest the agriculturist
from Cow Flat should attempt to light his pipe at
the arc lamp and fall back a corpse into the bosom
of his family. There is to be the usual great show
of horses and miscellaneous country produce, and
—as something specially appropriate to the season
of the indigestible hot-cross bun —fireworks are to
be laid on for three evenings.
I hear that the secretary of Sydney, Women’s
Hospital collection committee, the other day,
called on Lady Duff, with a mild request that she
would preside over a table set at a street corner
on Saturday mornings, for the purpose of receiving
contributions. Her ladyship was afraid she would
not be able to do so. Then ivould she, could she,
allow the MisSes Duff to take a table—of course,
with a chaperone ? No, they were too young.
As a last inducement it was urged—“ They do it
at ’Ome.” Even this failed, and the committee is
—well, the committee are annoyed.
Yours faithfully,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Melbourne Confidences.
March 13, 1894.
The Australian Cup gathering at Flemington,
though socially select, was not at all richly uphol-
stered, many of the best-bred gowns showing
signs of a season’s wash and wear. But this last
spurt of summer, coming in the middle of an
autumn meeting, had upset calculations.
Lady Hopetoun was brilliant in pink faille, the
bodice fichu’d with ficelle lace. The Countess,
who of yore appeared to find agloomy satisfaction
in being outshone by local birds of Paradise, now
out-Herods Herod by her gay colours. Strolling
on the lawn last Tuesday she resembled a full-
blown rose.
The vice-regal tresses were not arranged in the
all-pervading “bun,” but in small tight rolls.
Rather a mistake, I think. No woman, whatever
her position, should submit to looking “ scrimped ”
about the head when pads are obtainable, and
other females, with perhaps not half the hair, are
making quite a phenomenal show.
The Governor looked laboriously affable in his
favourite grey coat —that monotonous garment
which is said to be shipped out to him in
consignments of a dozen at a time, and which
doesn’t suit him a bit. His pale, chemist-
like complexion cries aloud for a dark-blue
contrast. One could forgive him if he emu-
lated the typical impresario and sported a
fur collar. Considering that the hardy Earl has
been boiling a refractory billy under the broad,
blazing canopy of Heaven, it may seem strange to
the uninitiated that he has not acquired a little
sunburn or a casual freckle. I have it as a State
secret that the consumption of vaseline and
kalydor at Guv’ment House is not confined to
“ my lady’s ” dressing-room.
Miss Chirnside, in pink and black floral silk
and an artless ribbon sash, wore one of the rose-
trimmed “Gardener’s daughter” hats that raged
at the beginning of the season and are now being
thrown off cheap at the clearing sales. The
fragile Queenslander, Mrs. Steve Fairbairn, was
girlish as ever in a simple gown. Hubby, one of
the few black-coated men visible, towered a head
and shoulders above the little lady.
Heliotrope-muslined Miss Bon Watson, heroine
of the latest engagement, seemed to be enjoying
plenty of vice-regal patronage.
In spite of recent visitations to country houses,
the Hopetouns don’t get more gushing as their
departure draws near ; indeed they seem to keep
even their quondam hosts at a respectful distance.
Though our chief personage gets credit for being
geniality personified, he can hold his own with the
Countess at averting familiar handshakes from
belles who are not used to finding themselves kept
at bay. They both looked bored on Tuesday, and
the only time they smiled to any great extent was
when they escaped and got clean away by a
strategic movement. An individual who started
in pursuit received a haughty British snub for his
pains. But who can wonder that the suite
palls on their Nibses at times? Some of its
members don’t impress one as exciting cage-
fellows.
A Toorak magnate, erstwhile of mining fame,
paraded the lawn with a guinea-ed stamp, his
festive appearance in marked contrast to the garb
of his bachelor days. The sharer of his millions
sported an up-to-date “ basqued ” marcella, which
missed its chiefest charm through the jacket-tail
having been sat on and curled up at the edges.
“ How to be happy though rich ” seems to be as
knotty a problem as its antithesis. The wealthiest
girl at Flemington tramped the Lawn the whole
afternoon with a juvenile relative as drearily as a
shepherded boarding-school Miss, while an impe-
cunious youth, who won <£s on the hurdle-race,
made the stand ring with his shouts of jubilation.
Ho slapped his legs in ecstatic applause, until one
shuddered at the thought of his bruises. Do men
bruise ? The subject invites a newspaper corres-
pondence from married ladies,
A society matron was well to the fore in white,
with unruly shoulder-capes, which persisted in
blowing up, and had to be re-adjusted continually
by one or other of her numerous escorts. The
study of cape adjustment is certainly interesting.
Mrs. Septimus Miller, in a chiffoney confection
of glowing petunia, reminded one rather of a paper
valentine ; and Mrs. Robert Chirnside, in soft
green and brown, was several degrees more
effective.
Very short skirts are supposed to be fashionable,
bub, at the races, ankles were made a feature of by
only one woman of ton. Her extremities were
kept in countenance by that distinguished Oriental
visitor, Mr. Meennacohayle, whose small feet,
which hardly looked equal to balancing his rajah-
like proportions, must have aroused the envy of
many a long-heeled johnnie.
Some of our most exalted race-going families are
doing a period of deep mourning, so the autumn
meeting saw them nob. The whole Clarke con-
nection were absent, of course, as were, also, the
Manifolds. I hear that Miss Nellie Manifold,
whose wedding was recently postponed owing to
her mother’s death, is not going to stave off the
ceremony for long. Possibly she is anxious to
make an early start at improving her English-
man s horsemanship, in which branch of education
he is sadly deficient. Not that Romeo mounts on
the wrong side, or tumbles off as soon as the old
mare starts _ a trot, bub he can’t keep up to his
bride-elect in the hunting-field, and whenever
hard riding is the order of the day his expression
becomes pensive.
At the Town Hall the other night, the “ Try
Excelsior” boys wore harangued and presided
over by Chief Justice Madden. Our newest, or
nearly newest, knight, enthroned on a springy
chair and encompassed about by the weaker sex,
might easily have fancied himself a pasha in the
midst of his harem. When he mopped his brow
with his handkerchief an awful idea that
he would presently throw the handkerchief
to somebody, with an Oriental wink, flashed
across one’s mind. Mrs. Madden, in white
and green, surmounted by a pink and green
bonnet, looked to have been born a couple of years
earlier than daughter Daisy, who carried a less
youthful melange of black and green. At the
conclusion of a trying show the Maddens were
called for by a strange, dark vehicle, mistaken by
some of the onlookers for a hearse come to the
wrong house. It must have struck a chill to the
hearts of its owners, for they elected to walk
down the street, leaving the funeral car to follow.
At “Robertson and Moffat’s”sports, last week,
I saw some of the prettiest and best-dressed girls
in Melbourne. A feature of the sports was the
alarming collapse of the competitors as soon as
they reached the winning-post. Runners tumbled
to the ground in an apparently-dying condition.
Then their friends rolled and rubbed and mas-
saged them in so wholesale a manner that, as I
heard an elderly virgin remark, “it would have
brought a blush to a cheek of leather.”
Max O’Rell, who raves about the beauty of
London drapery “ sales-ladh s,” might have found
a similar article in the same line of business here
if he had looked for it at Saturday’s soft-goods
festival. The very sweetest visions came from
behind a counter, judging by the out of the
effusive young men who guarded them, and by the
interest the damsels displayed in the agility of the
champion shopwalker.
Reverting to the question of women and
whiskers. Dr. Clara Stone, the second of our
qualified doctoresses, was waited upon not long
ago by a would-be patient who besought her, im-
plored her, to reduce his growth of whiskers by
some electric process. The poor fellow was about
to trip “ home,’’ and may have been meditating
the capture of a wealthy bride en route. Whether
or no, he wanted Dr. Clara to probe his manly
cheek with a needle and restore a portion of the
bushy country to its original state of smoothness.
Shaving wouldn’t do, it seemed. The more he
shaved the bluer his face got, and as a last re-
source he had been advised to try electrical punc-
tuation. His reason for singling out a lady to
take his hair off was not quite evident, but one
supposes that he thought she would stab him
gently. However, Miss S. refused to undertake
the contract, and the patient reluctantly withdrew.
In the wilds of Beaconsfield the florid taste of
L. L. Smith, M.L.A., gets the necessary scope.
Mr. Smith (he was observed of all observers at
Flemington) has built himself a breezy little resi-
dence, with a model poultry farm attached, away
on the Beaconsfield heights. The hen-and-rooster
arrangements are said to be highly instructive,
the garden surrounding the “chateau” is cer-
tainly a wonderful evidence of man’s inhumanity
to Nature. I have seen this garden from near and
afar. Every here and there a marble statuette
adorns a plaster pedestal, but the glory of the
pleasure grounds is chiefly upheld by a regi-
ment of thin white posts supporting glass
balls of various sizes and colours. Some of them
are twice as large as an ordinary gold-fish bowl,
and some are about the size of cocoanuts. A long
row of these smaller ornaments, standing at equal
distances apart down the side of a gravel walk,
appears to have been stuck there for the amuse-
ment of visitors who feel inclined for “ three shies
a penny.” The general effect beggars description.
It is as though the festive Smith had discovered a
giant Christmas-tree in the neighbouring forest
and carried off those “prizes” which at juvenile
parties are always left hanging on the top boughs.
There are at least a hundred glass balls glistening
in the sun. They glitter on spikes over the roof
of a rural tea-house, and I think I noticed one on
the lofty summit of the ancestral flagstaff. The
explanation of this barbaric splendour seems to be
the fact that Smith p£re was once proprietor of
Cremorne Gardens, where his famous son acquired
an early reverence for bits of colour.

Miss Jennie Lee and her weeping waif

with more success than might have been expected,
taking several things into consideration. This is
the lady’s farewell season prior to her departure
for England, and The Bulletin’s grief at the loss
of a favourite actress is tempered somewhat by
the fact that this country has already had too
much “Jo.” “Jo” has grown to be a very, very
solemn thing in these later years. He has been
“moved on” in nearly every theatre in Aus-
tralasia, and there is hardly a veteran actor
of any note in these provinces who hasn’t moved
him on at some time or other. “Jo ” has
been found weeping on every property doorstep
in the continent; and several million half-crowns
have been laid beside his dying bed by Snagsby,
the sympathetic law-stationer ; and his broom and
his death-cough are better known even than
Parkes, and several hundred tiipes more respected.
“Jo ” is about the oldest thing in Australia now,
barring the gallows, and the manner in which
Jennie Lee keeps the aged drama afloat in all its
pathos is nothing short of marvellous. Still, as
already mentioned, Australia has had almost
enough “ Jo.” Next week will be filled in with
“ The Grasshopper.”

“Hans, the Boatman” is to bo staged
next week at Sydney Criterion, with Miss Hen-
rietta Watson in the part of Hans’ wife—the
character so ably filled by Myra Kemble on the
last visit of the quaint Dutch- Vankee fisherman.
The career of “Captain Fritz” might not have
been so short if that musical comedy-drama hadn’t
been quite so long. “Hans” has at least the
advantage of being more condensed, and ho
appears in a new edition, whatever that may
mean. Also Miss Watson will be a tower of
strength to the show, and is, in all probability, the
actress of all others in Australia who is calculated
to give the sketchy production a lift just where it
is most needed.

No change is yet announced at Sydney
Her Majesty’s, where the Irish drama still pur-

Sydney Gaiety, which has been closed so
long that few of the present generation can remem-
ber when it was open, will make a fresh start
Easter Saturday with a comedy co., under the
management of Mr. W. J. Wilson. The old house
has been dusted and otherwise freshened up, also
the old name has been dropped out of sight, and it
is now to be known as the Bijou.

The variety co. at Sydney Royal has been
strengthened by the addition of a minstrel who
wears the portentous name of Clarence Lyndal,
and does his best to live up to that weighty cog-
nomen. By the way, there is understood to be a
little unpleasantness at the Royal. “Unpleasant-
ness ” is a term which covers anything, from cross
looks to general assault.

Fillis’ Circus has returned to Sydney after
many wanderings, and opens next Friday night
on the accustomed stand opposite Redfern Rail-
way-station. A steeplechase, vaguely designated
“The Stag Hunt,” is one of the principal new
features, and is expected to appeal strongly to the
feelings of a country where people don’t hunt
stag. There is a lamentable want of originality
about this idea, somehow. If Fillis fully under-
stood the public feeling he would change the stag-
hunt into a wild race after a defaulting banker
who would have lOsec. start and would be recog-
nisable by his bell-topper and the Bible sticking
conspicuously out of his coat-pocket.

A successful racing day accounted for an
extra over-crowd at Melbourne Princess’s last
Saturday. The wide stretch of standing room in
the dress-circle bristled with famous personages,
from Tom Hales down to members of Parlia-
ment, and the hot air was delicately perfumed by
the breath of those who had been drinking Titan’s
health. Notwithstanding a general tendency to
take things kindly, “La Mascotte ” gave only
moderate pleasure to all. This is never a fast-run
opera. Although on Saturday the pace was
furious for the first mile, it slackened off after-
wards in accordance with precedent, and the
demonstration that greeted the weighing-in was
not very hearty. The characters have no stamina
to speak of. They dash away at the outset in a
taking manner, and presently they wobble all over
the track, running wide when they oug'ht to hug
the rails and sometimes doing their best to bore
the audience. The artists in charge of these
erratic contestants are not to be greatly blamed,
Pippo, for instance, is a wayward animal showing
a good deal of temper at the finish, and Ryley
handles him as well as can be expected. A
shepherd who jibs at getting married to Nellie
Stewart is a nasty creature to manage. Bettina,
for her part, prepares to throw herself away upon
a doddering old prince, whilst Fiametta, after
lathering a tame dude with a riding whip until
they reach the distance, eventually abases herself
before his glass eye and implores forgiveness for
her previous good taste. The sporting metaphor
seems to be getting mixed.
* a *
Miss Nellie Stewart, despite some forced
vivacity in the first act, makes a charming Mas-
cotte, her share of the “Glou-Glou ” duet—which
is otherwise well sung by the beauteous Ryley—
winning more than half of a double encore. Miss
Yarley acts the part of Fiametta better than any
she has played up to date, but Tapley takes an
unduly serious view of Frettelini, her glass-eyed
suitor. Lauri, somehow, is not here a riotously droll
potentate. He appears to suffer from a sense of
royal dignity most of the time, and when called
upon to play the fool without reserve you can
almost see him blushing for his own want of pur-
pose. Courtneidge, on the other hand, makes
farmer Rocco a much brighter portion of the opera
than that hungry agriculturist has been in the
past. The part suits him, and he revels in it.
Seeing that “Mascotte” is comparatively fresh
again, and that the present cast gives new inter-
est, it will probably pack the Princess’ for two
weeks. After which, a revival of “Paul Jones,”
with Ryley in Marian Burton’s dainty shoes.

Maggie Moore, at the Royal, doesn’t loosen
her grip of an admiring public. One Saturday
she set up “Forty-Nine” and made that ram-
shackle fiction hum again. Maggie, as the red-
headed heiress who picked .up a musical education
on the boundless prairie, is a whole Californian
drama in herself, and the other members of the
company give valuable support to the scenery.
The coon banquet, which was always a strong
feature of “Forty-Nine,” is more gamey than
ever, but that evil-smelling bird must return to
the Royal larder forthwith. Next Saturday they
revive “The Colleen Bawn” out of respect to
St. Patrick, a gintleman vaguely understood to be
Maggie Moore’s godfather.

The same respectable saint will have to
answer in the hereafter for a production of “ The
Shaughraun ” at the Alexandra. This further
outburst of Irish sentiment is also billed for
March 17, a wake of exceptional solemnity being
now in active preparation. Meanwhile, Dan
Barry and his devoted followers are doing all they
know to discover the plot of “ Right’s Right.”
The abduction of one or two infants in the first
act has something to do with the horrors that
come after. Yet, it is probable that the show
might be shoved along to its furions climax with-
out a first act. What they chiefly depend upon
m this instance is the last act, although the
dramatic effect of a young woman dangling from
a meat-hook over a moonlit stream goes far to en-
sure a satisfactory attendance.

The Alhambra has added “a great
English comedian ” to its stock variety company.
The newcomer, Harry Steele, turns out to be an old,
old friend from London’s beery ’alls, who rambles
to the front upon roller skates, singing in a major
key, “I stand before you ! ” Whereupon he falls
with a sickening thud. After many repetitions of
this statement, and the same number of sudden
descents, the gentleman begins to lose some of his
early charm, but the performance shows original
points, nor has Time impaired its agility.

The solution of the present trouble is, ot course, for the

James and Maggie and their friends. There is a tide, &c.
Nellie Stewart does her duty by her parts as con-
scientiously as ever, or more so, if that be possible. If
she over-acts them in some cases, she is none the less a
bright example to other lady artists who seem chiefly
anxious to catch the eyes of their particular friends in
front. Nellie reminds one of the bright fixed star, which
beams with untiring industry whilst the little stars try to
excite attention by winking.

and Johannesburg is a hell. I have never spent such an

no money to be made for a company, but the records in

which fills one’s pockets.

Editor Bulletin. Sir,—ln your paper of 7th Oct., ’93
(p. 20), a local correspondent furnishes the public with
crude and unrefined misstatements re some of my dis-
coveries regarding “ curly hair.” If that paltry commu-
nication had been fully truthful I would' pass it
unchallenged. Neither in public nor in private have I
ever used such language as “ nigger temperament,”
which the vulgar correspondent unwisely attributes to
me, without even the shadow of common politeness.
Never, until reading your correspondent’s calumniatory
lines, had I thought of such a fallacy as negro tem-
perament (“ nigger temperament ”). Hence, in attribut-
ing to me that vulgar phrase, consists his dishonesty.
The gist of my knowledge regarding curly hair is embodied
in my book, entitled “ Physiognomy Illustrated,” pages
857 to 363 inclusive— ibid, page 403. Copies of that book
are in every large public library in Australia, and also in
many of the libraries of the other English-speaking
peoples. My ideas are not given to the public in the
“ blunt terms” attributed to me by that prevaricating
correspondent. Last, if not least, that illiterate inter-
nuncio is too cowardly to sign a name.—Yours, J. Shims,
M.D. San Francisco, 10th Feb., 1894.

breakfast. She has all the attributes of success, and I
guess she is a good investment for managers.”

Richard Perristan, a one-time actor, died last month, a
beggar, in San Francisco. The one great circumstance in
Perristan’s life was his stupendous good fortune in the
Havannah lottery, where he drew a prize of £lOO,OOO, in
'75. Apparently, however, there was blood on the big
prize, and Perristan never had a vestige of luck there-
after. iiHe couldn’t even sit down on a chair like an
ordinary man without the bottom falling out of it and
dropping him through, and the last 20 years of his life are
an eloquent sermon on the curse of gambling.

Dear Bulletin,— The P.P. par. in last issue about
“ astronomy Proctor ” and myself is, doubtless, very good
reading—as anything about two such celebrities must be
—but the truth is not in it. When that brilliant exponent
of “ Other Worlds than Ours ” Visited Australia 1 was a
poor young man, then unmatriculated even, and quite
uninitiated into the wily ways of managers. Thus the
whole story is as imaginary as the existence of Utopia
(Limited).—Yours, Carlyle Smytiib.

Sydney Grundy’s “ Moonlight Club ” in “The Old Jew”

Olga Nethersole has made the success ot her life at the
little London Court Theatre, where she has produced a
play called “ The Transgressor.” There is the story of a
lunatic wife, love and bigamy, with the usual heroic
determination of the wronged woman to stick to her bar-
gain, “because he loves me so.” It is said that she is
backed “by a powerful syndicate.” They always are.
Lawrence Oautley, says The Bulletin’s London corres-
pondent, had been engaged to play a part in the “ Gaiety
Girl," but after three or four nights he somehow dropped
out of the bill. His complimentary benefit at the Lyric
was very successful, and was a smart affair in its way.
The house was full, and no end of w,»Il dressed women
were there. Mrs. “ Myee Sydney ” Oautley is a favourite
amongst the many friends she has made in England. The
programme was a long one, and was negotiated success-
fully until it came to the turn of Lawrence and “Miss
Myee Sydney ” to play the balcony scene in “ Romeo and
Juliet.” Whether it was that Romeo was too much
occupied in rolling those eyes of his about I can’t say, but
Lawrence forgot all that poor Shakespeare had put in the
mouth of the love-sick youth, and it took the loud-voiced
prompter all his time to keep him on the track. No
doubt this did not serve to give poor Juliet much confi-
dence, and she certainly did not shine. Probably she
may do better another time, but she is very amateurish,
and all the most, friendly critic could find to say was
“ that she gave promise of doing better things by and
bye.”
The revival of “Caste,” at the Garrick, was not a
blazing triumph, says Tub Bulletin’s London correspon-
dent ; indeed, to tell the truth, it was a poor affair all
round, the bright exception being the Esther Eccles of
Miss Kate Rorke, which will take rank with any previous
performance of the part. She was charming and sym-
pathetic enough to have pleased even Robertson himself.
The George D’Alroy of Forbes Robertson was also good,
and Miss Rose Leclerq was an ideal Marquise. But what
shall I say of the rest of the crew ? Place aux dames I
Miss May Harvey was distinctly out of her element as
Polly. Abingdon, as Hawtree, apparently could not
forget that he has been for many years an Adelphi
villain. Poor young Hare is more to be pitied than
blamed for about the weakest delineation of Sam Gerridge
that I have ever seen. He was overweighted by the part,
and handicapped by the recollection of his father’s con-
ception of the character. But to me the greatest dis-
appointment of all was G. W. Anson. I had expected to
see something out of the way after hearing that he had
played old Eccles a hundred times in Australia. Did he?
well, if so, all I can say is that Australian playgoers are
very easily satisfied. He was boisterous in manner and
wanting in spontaneity of humour. The old man we
know was not a loveable being, but Anson need not have
made him such a hopelessly degraded sot. It is no-doubt
hard to steer clear of the exaggeration which brings down
the gods in such a part, but I thought Anson was too
good an artist to fall into such an error.

From the judge’s summing up of the Mercantile
Bank case.—“ The Crown Prosecutor had asked Davies
certain questions which might lead to an unfair impres-
sion in the minds of the jury. He had asked him the
names of the companies with which he had been con-
nected, and having got a list, elicited the fact that several
of them had failed. (Which of ’em didn’t fail ?) It was
quite possible that thousands of persons had been brought
to beggary by the failure of these companies, and ex-
tremely probable that no man regretted it more deeply
or bitterly than Davies. But until it could be proved
elsewhere that he was morally and legally liable for it
they must dismiss it from their minds altogether.” All
this time the jury was considering a balance-sheet on
which the failure of those same companies ought surely to
have been indirectly indicated, but most certainly tcam’t.

The evidence law at Melbourne and the evidence
law at Sydney appear to be widely-different things. The
N.S.W. Supreme Court, when it found a balai ce-slieet
signed by paid directors, took for granted that those
directors knew the general contents of the books upon
which the balance-sheet was founded, just as on signing
a p n. they would know for what amount it was drawn.

The 134th clause of Melb. Metropolitan Gas
Co.’s Act reads—“ The profits to be divided in any one
year shall not exceed 10 per centum on the paid-up
capital of the co.” The paid up capital has been watered
and the divs. on this diluted outlay have averaged some-
thing like twice 10 per cent, for many years. When, why,
and how was the original clause adapted to the great gas-
grab, or does it still hold good, and if so ?

Many Melbournites are economising by dis-

likewise.

The chairman of a Sydney Life Co. has dis-

feited.

“Tiger” Inglis’ attempted London flotation of

N.S.W. Wesleyan Church is now a colliery
proprietor, having acquired by bequest 625 paid-up shares
in Mount Kembla Colliery Co. The Church does not pro-
pose to realise on these shares in the present state of the

have a delicate part to play. Coalminers are about two-
thirds Wesleyans, where they profess any religion.

The Q. Deposit Bank has just undergone its
second reconstruction, and will doubtless go on recon-
structing till the day of judgment, since public confidence
is utterly gone, and there is no hope of doing further
business. The whole concern should have been put in
the hands of trustees, to liquidate as the property market
permitted. Then the depositors, having a preferential
claim, might by degrees get their money back; as it is,
they stand an outside show of losing the lot.
* • •
The long-promised restoration of confidence seems
still to be far away. Colonial Bank deposits are selling in
a feeble market at 13s. 3d. ; City Bank of Melbourne fetch
155.; Commercial of Australia (fixed for 10 years) are
being offered at 145.: English, Scottish, and Aus-
tralian, at 14s. 6d. ; Queensland National, at 15s. 6d. ; and
Bank of Victoria, at a shade higher. The great majority
of these “securities” carry interest at 4J per cent., so
that but for the want of confidence they ought to be in
greater demand than Government 4 per cent, stocks,
which are mostly a shade above par. It isn’t the want
of money for investment that keeps them low and almost
unsaleable, for there is so much of it that the Victorian
Government has raised the price of its debentures to
choke off the inrush of capital ; it is the want of confi-
dence, and nothing else. In face of these figures, all
the cheerful assertions that public faith has been restored
are only the crackling of a very small lot of thorns under-
neath a very large pot.

James Munro’s Real Estate Bank held another
statutory wake over its own decomposed Remains on
Thursday of last week. The report was not of the usual
despairing order, in fact it was rather hilarious than
otherwise. The shareholders have been duly crushed and
retorted, and the bank has paid a div. of 2s. in the £ out
of the results. There is now £6820 in hand against liabili-
ties of £584,000, but when the B list of contributaries is
squeezed to the uttermost, grave hopes are entertained of
another shilling, or, possibly, a shilling and a few
coppers. The prospect of 3s. in the £ for depositors is
calculated to make any Melbourne bank hilarious in these
times, and when this result is achieved, poor old James
Munro, who is now' trying to sell little suburban allot-
ments in his wooden office at Malvern, will be almost re-
habilitated in public estimation as an acute and lucky
financier.

The English and Australian Mortgage Bank
(Melbourne) announces, after a long course of liquidation,
that its liabilities are £841,780, and that, after squeezing
the shareholders dry and selling everything which
is saleable, there isn’t enough money available to
pay any div. whatever. Therefore, Judge Madden granted
the necessary authority to dig the entrails out of the
B list of contributories, who are feebly expected to
yield £5OOO. This, with sundry small sums in hand, and
anything that may be obtained by selling the big ledgers
for fertiliser, may make up a first and final dividend of 2d.
in the £, and again it may not.

The Union Bank publishes a balance-sheet
which, compared to the ordinary bank-balance in these
times, is like the shadow of a great rock in an arid land.
The profits for the year (£60,295) are smaller than usual
but they are sufficient for a div. of eight per cent. The
bank has nearly £4,000,000 in available cash, and its re-
serve-fund of £1,000,000 is more discoverable than the
average reserve, the greater part of it being invested in
Govt, stocks. The deposits are nearly £17,000,000, and
the note circulation £500,000. Tbe Union Bank has now
been in existence for 57 years, and has got through every
financial storm in that long period without even a sus-
picion being cast upon its stability.

Mr. A. J. Riley, the Sydney softgoods magnate,
ex-mayor, ex-member of both Houses of Parliament, and
once a'prospective K.C.M.G., is bankrupt. According to
his statement, he was worth £56,000 in January, ’93. In
September, ’93, he called a meeting of his creditors, being
then worth —on paper—£36,ooo. Now he shows a
shortage of over £58,000, representing a fall of £114,000
in less than 18 months. This result is attributed to the
banking panic.
Farrar & Co., the well-known Melbourne mer-
chants, have gone bankrupt; liabilities (which are always
a certainty), £98,000 ; assets (which are an awful uncer-
tainty), £lB,OOO. The unhappy arch - reconstructed
it is stated, is a creditor for £78,788, and its pros-
pective loss appears to be something like £70,000.
At last half-year’s rates this is nine months’ profits gone

Mention of the departure of “ Lucky ” Hunt to

awakens the enquiry—what became of the other men who
made their piles on the Thames (M.L.) a quarter of a

baton—he then kept a store at Tookey’s Hat; Thomas

large mining fortune by a speculation in Turkish bonds at
the time of the San Stefano affair ; and “Jim ” Farmer,

We never think of growling, we’re contented with our lot
Though with water “ bob ” a gallon, mind, it’s coming
pretty hot.
But it riles us when we read the weep that comes by every
mail
Of some jackaroo’s adventures and the agonising tale
That he’s written for his mother, and, being in the clique,
She’s had his yarn inserted in the Evening Penny Shriek.
How he travelled to “Siberia” and had to shoot his nag,
And a half-a-column drivel on the empty water-bag ;
How he slowly staggered onwards and circled in his
tracks,
And grasped the cheap revolver scenting danger from the
blacks.
And he shovels in the horror of an arid, burning plain,
With the salt-bush, dry and withered, craving hungrily
for rain;
Where he found some dying diggers, though they hadn’t
strength to ask,
Yet he gave them all the swankey that he carried in his
flask.
Then he walked the usual sixty miles without another
sup,
And led an expedition out to pick the others up.
Then he finishes his letter with the never-failing moan
How his wand'rings in the wilderness have made him skin
and bone ;
Then his mother sends a Bible, and his father sends a
cheque,
Bringing joy and consolation to the worn and battered
wreck—
Well, the truth about the matter is, these mothers’ darling
pets
Would swear they did a perish if deprived of cigarettes.
And you’ll never see these dandies leave a comfortable
job,
For they’re all of ’em connected in a manner to a nob,
Who’s got them easy billets not requiring any skill,
Though they often bang the miner when they’re beating
at the drill,
And the speculating visitor who drives a four-in-hand,
And who’s got a son or nephew in the cuS-and-collar
band,
Hysterically babbles that he’s glad to see a line
Is drawn between the gentleman and workman at the
mine,
For the reconstructed nobleman with fashionable yawn
Mustn’t tolerate advances from the lab’rer lowly born ;
So it’s when we read the papers that we get a kinder
narked
To think that by the “ Jackaroo ” the miner’s billet’s
sharked.
And when they’re playing billiards in their flannel tennis
suits
We feel like heaving something at these “ silver-tail ”
galoots ;
But the thing that makes us giggle and our temper often
cool
I* to see’em get the “black ’un ” when they’re playing
devil’s pool.
Entertainments may be scanty and our pleasures may be
few,
But we have a mild excitement in the mining “ Jackeroo,”
So we gather and discuss him, and for hours we often sit
When the ivories are clicking and the billiard lamps are lit.
Coolgardie.

Or any symptoms of a disordered digestive
apparatus? If so, there is no remedy in the world
so safe and sure to give relief as Fletcher’s Pills
and Clements Tonic. Don’t be misled into wast-
ing time and money on any of the “All-failing”
nostrums so speciously advertised by designing
quacks and dishonest rogues. Remember, these
two remedies have stood the test of time, that
their merits are proved, and that a few shillings
invested on them may save you weeks and months
of suffering, and, perhaps, pounds of expense, for
they have done so in hundreds of cases, and we
will send you evidence to prove our assertions on
receipt of your name and address. Remember,
delay is dangerous, and that every hour you neglect
your case the complication increases and a'cure
becomes more difficult. Shun the cheap quack
doctors and designing nostrum compounders; stick
to the remedies Clements Tonic and Fletcher’s
Pills. They are absolutely genuine, and h*aye
proved their efficacy in hundreds of cases and will
do so every time. They are sold everywhere and
made only by F. M. Clements, Newtown,
Sydney.

Tay Pay O’Connor describes Lord Onslow

will his lordship’s late Maoriland subjects say ?
Parkes has, it is stated on good authority,
valuable interests in three lately-discovered
Westralian goldmines, the interest in one case at
least being a gift from a Westralian political ad-
mirer.
The Adelaide Supreme Court Judges are
not a happy family. Both the puisne justices are
jealous of the Chief Justice, and they deeply
resent his recent appointment as Lieut.-Governor;
for while he gets honour and emolument they
have to do his work and their own without
additional pay.
The very latest
allegation about Mrs.

careful.”
Old Jeremiah Brown,

A candidate for one of the Sydney Parlia-

George Grey has left for England, and
doesn’t know when he will come back. An im-

the Gothic left on March 8. Queen Victoria has
long expressed a desire to talk with the ancient.
Miss Bonynge, to whom our old friend*
Lord Deerhurst, has been married in London with

“ I’ll make a peer of him,” she said,
“ Who peers has made of many.”
Old Gladstone shook his heavy head ;
“ No, thank you, ma’am —not any.
Fools I’ve made peers, to be my tools,

An Australian Judge, conversing with a
protninent barrister the other day, said, “You
are likely to be made acting-judge in a couple of
days. Take my cue. When you go on the bench
be a terror. Punish to the limit of your power.
Afterwards you can be just. But begin by being
Draco.”
001. Sec. Tozer, the bugbear of Queens-

of the Ministry, comes south for a holiday in
Maoriland. He tells you confidentially that his
health was broken in the shearers’ war, when,
“ single-handed, sir, I fought and quelled the
army of anarchy.”
Jabez Balfour, now in prison at Buenos
Ayres awaiting extradition, says that he “has
entire confidence in'the justice of God.” Evi-
dently he expects to be hanged, but as he can’t get
more than penal servitude for life it would have
been more accurate if Jabez had only expressed
partial confidence.
The last words of, the good-natured 0. J.
Roberts, M.L.0., wringing the hands of ac-
quaintances on board the English-bound boat at
Sydney wharf, were that he was “off Home.”
And yet Mr. Roberts first saw the light in Sydney,
and could hardly have risen to be Postmaster-
General in any other civilised land.
Ambrose Hallen, the blind candidate for
Sherbrooke (N.S.W.), is in many respects a
remarkable man. Single-handed he has reclaimed
from the wilderness a farm of 12 acres, and clears
<£4oo a year at poultry-rearing. His place is the
prize poultry-farm of the province. Hallen is a
fair speaker, and has a wonderful memory.
English Daily News tells of a new North
Country Mayor who, in returning thanks, said—
“ln ray opinion, a mayor should be like Csesar’s
wife, all things to all men.” Maryborough (Q.)
News caps this with the speech of a member of
Bundaberg Ferry Board : “ The fact is, a ferry-
man should be like Potiphar’s wife, above sus-
picion.”
Alfred Deakin, brightest of native-born
statesmen, when much in evidence politically
visited a Vic. up-country show and lectured on
“ Irrigation.” Next day, two farmers met in the
street, and, talking over the show, one said:
“ I see Deakin was at the show yesterday.”
“ Deakin ! ” said the other, “ whose horse is he? ”
Such is fame.
The irrepressible Mortimer Franklyn is
not dead; au contraire, he is very much to the
fore as agent for the Mutual Life Insurance Co. of
New York. He is making over .£4OOO a year. A
rival insurance man told The Bulletin’s London
correspondent that Mortimer some time since took
Liverpool by storm and insured every man who
was worth insuring in the place. He is considered
one of the smartest men in the business.
If the poem published in Adelaide E.
Journal by Caldwell, S. Australian M.P., about
the local Methodist Conference, fails to extinguish
the author at next election, there is no justice left
in the land. The first verse :
The Wesleyan Methodist Conference
Has Just began to meet
In the central sanctuary Church,
Which stands in Pirie-street.
It is quite Qjl the cards that Griffith will
resign his judgeship arid return to the political
arena. Judge Harding cannot forgive his being
passed over, and seldom misses a chance to be dis-
agreeable, as witness his dig at S.W.G. re the
Court being' “made a' puppet of in insolvency
cases.” Fancy Harding being made a puppet!
Why, he once gave a man “40 years” fur con-
tempt, for coming into Court with a revolver in
his pocket.
Colonel Miller, the father of Money and
Mars of that ilk, was a man so jealous as to be
almost monomaniacal. In the fifties he made a
second marriage with one of the acknowledged
belles of Hobart, a good and charming lady,
but always walked about three yards behind
her in the street to keep a watch on the
“ youth who winked a roving eye.” The pro-
cession was one of the principal amusements of
the sleepful village.
Passage from Romilly’s reminiscences
the West Pacific dealing with New Britain :
The mate then said i “ I don’t so much mind leaving the
captain behind, as he has a boat, but, unfortunately, he
has left his only pair of trousers on board, and I'm afraid
he won’t like to go on board a man-of-war to see you
gentlemen without them.” “ But,” said we, “ has he not
gone to call upon a lady?” “ Oh,” said the mate, “ she
won’t mind ; her husband never wears trousers, and
there is nothing she hates so much as a man that gives
himself airs.”
Phil May, The Bulletin hears, has an
atelier in Paris, where he now is, in addition to
his studio in Kensington. He intends to devote
himself to “serious” work over there, but will
alternate lighter business, to be done in London.
“ His artist friends think he is wasting his un-
doubted genius on black and white, which, how-
ever well it pays, will not bring him fame” —
which is mere bosh. By the way, he is now on
the regular staff of Punch, and has given up
working for Sketch, though they have a lot of
stuff of his which will appear from time to time.
Judge Seth Smith, of Maoriland, has
resigned and is going back to England, and the
country at large is going down to the wharf to
see him off. Judge Smith is a wonderful example
of the advantages of having an uncle. He
was the nephew of an imported British
bishop, and followed his uncle the bishop to
Maoriland. There he was promptly made a
magistrate. Like almost all men named Seth he
was a gloomy and morose Christian, with a
boiler - plated creed of the kind that leads
to much damnation of unbaptised infants.
By-and-by be rose, through his influence with
the boiler-plated Christian community, to be
a Judge of the Native Land Court, and as
he knew little of the Maori language, or of
Maori land tenure, or of Maori habits, customs,
or modes of thought, he was a great and wonder-
ful failure. Most of his confused and inextricable
judgments deserve to be preserved in spirits to
show what a bishop’s nephew is capable of.
As an example of the utter hopelessness of being
named Seth, however, he was eminently successful
as all times. Seth, as a front name, is only one
degree less hopeless than Jabez.
“Collectors of Australian books,” writes
The Bulletin’s London correspondent, “ will
shortly have a rare chance of securing some gems,
as Henniker Heaton has made up his mind to
bring his valuable library to the hammer. Re
began collecting many years ago, when he was a
poor man, and, fortunately for him, before the
fashion for Australian literature set in. He
was consequently enabled to pick up all kinds
of rare editions, and numbers of duplicates. His
collection contains many splendid works, some of
them unique, notably De Quiros, of which he
possesses the only copy known to exist, and for
which there will be keen competition. The book
is worth hundreds. Having so many irons in the
fire, he finds that he cannot spare time to go book-
hunting as he used to do, and, being unable to
keep his collection up to date, he has determined
to dispose of it.”
The Bulletin prints portraits of the
parties in the notorious Te Kloot divorce-ease,
heard at Sydney, last week—Rudolph Oscar
Randwick Te Kloot, petitioner ; Florence Mary
Isabel Te Kloot, respondent; and John Edye
Manning, co-respondent. The jury gave a
majority verdict for petitioner on the ground of
adultery, with .£2OOO damages against co-respon-
dent, to be settled on respondent and her child !
The evidence was so unsavoury that the Chief
Justice prohibited its publication ; and a feature
in the case was the unmeasured manner in which
his Honor denounced the brutality of the private
detectives employed. Manning, the co-respon-
dent, who is very highly connected, is 60 years of
age, and the father of a family. He “protected ”
the young couple, and in 1892 found employment
for petitioner in the Civil Service; before, as
the Judge phrased it, “acting the part of a
scoundrel.”
W. S. Dowel’s address to the electors of Bin-
gara (N.S.W.) seemingly cribs a verse of Brunton
Stephens’ poem “The Dominion of Australia,”
which is mutilated and printed as a prose perora-
tion without acknowledgement. Otherwise, the
address is a copy of that which bamboozled Tam-
worth at last election. Thus Dowel :
The dawning light tinges the hills with the grandeur of
our destiny, and the great national life that must be
embodied in the future commonwealth that creates Aus-
tralia a nation, great, glorious, and free. Not yet her
day. How long “not vet?” There comes the flush of
violet, and heavenward faces all aflame with sanguine
imminence of morn wait but the sun rise to proclaim the
day of our great nation born.
Thus Stephens :
Not yet her day. How long “not yet?”
There comes the flush of violet
And heavenward faces all aflame
With sanguine imminence of morn
Wait but the sun-kiss to proclaim
The Day of the Dominion born.

Parkes hereafter may be famous as the
only man who launched out with a couple of
advts. in Wells’ Gazetteer of the Australian
Colonies, published in Sydney, 1848. Turning up
the very few advts. in this ancient volume one
finds : —“Henry Parkes—lvory and Bone Turner,
&c. Manufacturer of Billiard and Bagatelle balls,
Chess and Backgammon men, Dice, Crochet
needles, Dog whistles, Ivory thimbles, &0., &o.
Dealer in English and Foreign Toys and fancy
articles. Henry Parkes, No. 20 Hunter St., near
George St., Sydney.” Upon the page facing
’Enry’s principal manifesto is a smaller advt. in-
viting inspection of his Old English Dolls, Whales’
teeth, &c., &c. As a dealer in nursery goods he
acquired, perhaps, the germs of inspiration for his
baby poems of 40 years later —“ Little doggie on a
little loggie,” and so forth. Yet the old man’s
history of Parkes and N.S.W. makes no reference
to his early connection with dolls and dog whistles.
Before setting up in his humble Hunter-st. shop,
Henry had done indifferently well as a “tide-
waiter.” It was not till he entered Parliament
that he thoroughly mastered the art of catching
tides on the turn.
Queensland Full Court’s decision that
driving a cart outside a plantation is not legally
“field work ” cuts at the root of one of the worst
black-labour abuses—the employment of kanakas
in unlawful avocations to the detriment of white
labourers.
An average of 20 to 30 men “ who have
seen better days ” call at Melbourne morgue every
morning to know if “ there’s anything on to-day.”
The fact that only 4s. “ a case ” is allowed a jury-
man again emphasises the marvellous enterprise
of the unemployed Victorian.
Angus and Robertson, Sydney, send two
illustrated Tory pamphlets dealing with Gladstone
and the Irish question. W.E.G., with Parnell,
Dillon, Davitt, and other Irish loaders, have all
their faults observed, set in a note-book, learned
and conned by rote. drawings and letterpessr
are ingenious and clever, and thoroughly partisan.
Dr Parker, the greatNonoonformistparson,
according to an interview in the Idler, “is con-
tinually giving sums of money away, of which
none but he and the recipient know anything
whatever.” Good old advertising Samaritan !
The story is horribly suggestive of that legendary
Irish advt.: “Whereas Patrick Maloney has
stolen my pig without my knowledge, if he doesn’t
return it his name will be published.”
Prodigious efforts were made to induce
Forde and Green, the two phantom Vic. Railway
Commissioners “ suspended ” along with Speight,
to bring actions against the Age on their little
accounts. But one of them, at least, had a good
deal of money to lose by going to law, and they
decided not to move. Allison Smith, the engine-
man, has chipped into the game, however. His
libel claim for <£15,000 has been served upon David
Syme, and people are beginning to feel sorry for
the beleaguered newspaper proprietor. Whoever
the Age may, or may not, have libelled, it is quite
certain that the lawyers, to whom Syme has
never done any damage, are making him suffer
unduly. Before these railway cases are done with
the pig-headed public may begin to understand
that the civil law is an accursed jaggedly weapon
made for themselves by the few who are licensed
to use it. Truly the Anarchist isn’t so very mad,
after all. He objects to Law,
Ata recent Northern
Circuit sittings, a perspir-
ing young counsel, scion
of a big legal family, had
just begun to address the
Court on behalf of pri-
soner, when he was
tapped on the shoulder.
Turning round to receive,
as he imagined, fresh
instructions from his
client, he was met with :
“ For God’s sake, young
man, sit down ; I could
do better myself !”
S. A. State Child-
ren’s Department has a
nice taste in nomencla-
ture, The dropped in-
fant is named accord-
ing to the spot where
found. Thus Rose Gar-
den was picked up under
a rosebush; Rosetta
Franklin came from a
door-step in Rosetta ter-
race, Franklin-street, and
so on. There are weird
possibilities about this
system. Think of Cab-
bagestalk Ashbarrel,

jewellery—watches and precious stones.

The commissioners had, by making the
N.S.W. railways payable, practically reduced the

M‘II wraith’s recent interviewing in
London re the Land-grant railways is merely the
pilot-fish that heralds the approach of the shark.
Two hundred homeless and half-starved
men were turned out of Adelaide Exhibition
grounds to make room for the fat, over-fed pigs
down for the show.
What is the meaning of the fact that the
“fashionable” element of the N.S.W. Female
Suffragists openly “ barracks ” for the so-called
“Freetrade ” cause ?
“In all democracies the true and wise
democrat, in the best interests of his cause, seeks
to establish and to render strong a Chamber of
Second Thoughts.”— Argus.
“The proposal to take food from the
mouths of honest, struggling citizens, so as to
put work into the hands of State-fed rogues and
vagabonds, is outrageous.”— Age.
Significant 1 There is only one titled
Premier in Australasia, but the leaders of the
Opposition—Berry, Braddon, Downer, and Parkes
—in four provinces are be-baubled.
A political prophecy to which the lat e
Parnell committed himself unreservedly in his last
days was that Haroourt was to be Gladstone’s
successor. He did not take Rosebery seriously.
The resolve of the Adelaide unemployed
to go to gaol in a body was met by a N.S.W.
M.L.0., with the last argument of kings. “We’ll
flog them,” he said. “ Bring them on ; we’ll flog
them.”
The Beacon (Max Hirsch) : —“ What is
the Argus, anyhow ? Has it abdicated its Free-
trade pretensions and become a mere tariff-
reformer—i.e., a moderate Protectionist? If so,
most people will prefer the genuine article dished
up in the Age.”
The U.S. alleged
Freetrade tariff has
come to further grief.
It wasn’t much of a
Freetrade tariff even
as the House of Re-
presentatives fixed it,
but now the Senate
has started to re-im-
pose even the very
few duties which the
Lower House re-
moved, and it begins
to look as if there
would be no new
tariff at all. The curse
of that famous N.S.
Wales Foreign-
traders’ cablegram
has blighted the move-
ment from the very
beginning.
Sheldon, M.L. A.,
of Sydney, told his

Mr. Sheldonis wrong.
When Ensign Rich-
ardson joined the
92nd Highlanders'he

that he could never

The Sydney police take much trouble to
catch the illicit distiller. But they take no trouble
to suppress the stuff he puts on the market.
Good grog—how can it be profitably sold at 3d. a

“ An obvious means of employing prisoners,
and one of the first to suggest itself, is to engage
them upon\ public works : on works Which, if not
undertaken by convicts, would not be undertaken
at all.”—Age.
Premier Rosebery’s promotion to th e
British Premiership is plainly due to the inffuenc 6
of Windsor Castle and Marlborough House, and
shows how strong and mischievous the influence
of the Crown still is.
Signs of the times. Duffy and O’Connell
(Kanaka champions) form part of a deputation to

cate the employment of white men on the boats
receiving subsidies for carrying the mail.

One of the things that Miss Floral Shaw didn’t

Rumoured that Premier Dibbs intends to
legally injunct John Davies, M.L.C., from putting
up a bust to him in the new Sydney Hospital.
Considering how very rough it is upon any man
to have his bust erected by John Davies, there is
some probability about the rumour.
Writes a Northern planter :—“ Out of 50
Kanakas landed on the Herbert not long ago, 14
were unfit for work and four were dying. The
others were eventually sent home. A vessel
recently brought seven under age, and an attempt
was made to get rid of them at reduced fees!"
Dr. Renwick, writes The Bulletin’s Lon-
don correspondent by last mail, sails for Sydney
by next Orient steamer. He intends to resign bis
seat in N.S.W. Upper House, and will contest a
popular seat. He has had several requisitions,
but, in all probability, will stand for a metropoli-
tan constituency.
The Argus on the vanity of relief works :
“ There can be no greater misfortune. When re-
lief works were initiated at Sydney, a few years
back, the whole loaferdom of Australia collected
together at Port Jackson.” Then the man who
runs from one end of Australia to another after
a miserable job is a loafer?
Symon, Q.C., is anxious to re-enter S.A.
Parliament. His present goal is the Council.
Should he enter the Assembly, there would be
bitter duels between him and Premier Kingston,
who have cordially hated each other ever since
they were articled clerks together in the office of
Mr. (now Chief Justice) Way.
It is only a question of sticking to the
Colonial Office and giving Lord Ripon no peace,
remarks The Bulletin’s London correspondent,
for the captain of the Costa Rica Packet to get
,it compensation out of the Dutch Government;
r L« the claim for £25.000 is too stiff, and, if per-
sisted in, will inevitably -lead to a refusal to enter-
tain it.
One phase of the Polynesian Labourers’
Act seldom noticed is that it is practically an Act
for the impoverishment of the soil. To reap the
benefit of the above Act a man must grow sugar—
and sugar exclusively. Result—the Mary River
is lined with abandoned plantations—ground
worked-out, cane sick. And other districts are
following suit.
Working-men are frequently upbraided
for being led away by “ paid agitators.” At all
events, their agitators are paid. Fat Man cheats
his agitator whenever he can; as witness the
Patriotic League (National Ass) in Brisbane,
where the sec.’s salary is months in arrear, while
the wealthy members are conveniently deaf to the
poor wretch’s howls to pay up subscriptions.
An instructive deputation has just worried
the Yictowian Ministaw of Wail ways about the
civil servants, so one naturally drifts into the
Grocaw, Bakaw, Butchaw, and Tailaw language.
The first six weeks of this year—or yaw—yielded
19 insolvencies in the Railway Department alone,
and the deputation was of indignant, blighted,
swindled tradesmen, whining that this was too
much.
Queensland Worker :—“lt is possible to
work up an agitation in the North and Centre
which might shake the MTlwraith party . . .
but such an agitation is not one that the workers
in the South would grow very enthusiastic over.”
If the workers in the South will not grow enthusi-
astic over an agitation which will upset their
direst enemy, their condition is, indeed, past
praying for.
London Times declares that George Dibbs
has been discourteous to the Imperial, treasury.
Yes, and the same bad boy has been discourteous
to Chicago. In course of trine he will have given
every continent and country a turn. Then there
will be an anti-Dibbs Federation League started,
which will bind together the whole civilised and
uncivilised peoples of the world. Finally, Dibbs
will be dethroned and Crick made governor of the
visible universe.
Among the sailors of the recently-foundered
Victoria—which is, presumably, only a sample of
the British navy in general—so per cent, were
foreigners. But the gruesome episode serves as a
gorgeous example of the heroism of the “British
seaman ” all the same. Every seaman is British
SUPERSTITIOUS.
ROAGAN : “I bin readin’ how General Wolseley is that super-
stitious, he’s afeared to walk under a ladder!”
REGAN : “D’ye mane it! Oi was seein’ meself about wan av
them British Ginerals I what thought it was unlucky
to stand befoore a tree wheniver a fight was
goin’ on.”
after he is dead, and the inscription on his tomb"
stone —if he has one —sets forth that he was a
noble Englishman, named Hans Jorgensen, and
died in defence of his Queen and country.
Victorian Premier Patterson : “ Many of
the men who are now, for mere party purposes,
directing agitations against the Government will,
if they are not a little more careful, create some-
thing which will alarm them when it occurs.”
Patterson delights in this sort of cheap and com-
bustible awfulness, but thecountry tires of waiting
for the dreadful occurrence which is always going
to eventuate, but which never takes place.
The Freetrade candidate for a Sydney
suburb begs voters to forgive him for his Protec-
tionist lapse of five years ago, on the ground that
“what I did once”—one little time and then no
more—“Parkes did for two years continuously
and has been fully pardoned for.” Is this to begin
a new apologetic era in which Parkes’ protracted
lapses of various kinds are to stand as excuses for
others to enjoy once—one little time —a much-
loved lapse with impunity?
Mrs. Leontine Cooper, of Brisbane (Q.),
has shaken her skirts at and abandoned the Q.
Woman’s Rights Society, because it asks for
“One-woman-one-vote.” Madame is a “littery
lydy,” and she is above eleetorally consorting with
any female “below her degree.” As a “lydy
patroness ” of the common female, she knows her
“spear,” but as a comrade of that female —
“ shudder me into hysterics were I not so master-
fully unfeminine ! ” says echo.
N.S.W. Chief Justice Darley, with
Justices Windeyer, Innes, Stephen and Foster,
sat lately on The Queen v. O’Keefe case. O’Keefe
bad been tried and sentenced at Quarter Sessions,
but on a technical point was released, and the
question now raised was whether he could be
re-tried on the original charge. Now, seeing that
barrister Moriarty is sole spokesman on O’Keefe’s
side, why is the Crown represented by F. E.
Rogers, Q. 0., Barton, Q. 0., and barrister
Dawson ? Such a bar must have cost £lOO.
Either there is a studied effort to produce a cer-
tain legal result or there is a manifest waste of
public money.
The Postal Conference in Maoriland ex-
pressed an opinion unfavourable to the employ-
ment of coloured crews on the P. and O. mail
steamers, but took no official action. Is there no
democrat with spunk enough to move a stoppage
of the Australian subsidy unless the evil is
mended? If the Australias refused to enter into
any contract unless white labour was employed,
the steamship co. would soon come to terms.
Meanwhile, every believer in a white Australia
should support the Orient Co., which, in many
respects, gives the better service, employs all
white crews, and has broken down an ancient
monopoly.
“Prisoner, you are a lucky man. You
are discharged. It is the jury’s verdict and not
mine that sets you free. I believe every word
sworn against you. Go.” This set speech with
but a few unimportant verbal variations is de-
livered in N.S.W. Supreme and District Courts
on an average about once a month. What does
the practice indicate? Well, that soon it will be
a burning question whether the jury system will
be abolished, or Judges be restrained. Which
shall it be ? There can only be one answer.
W.A. democratic election
programme, as submitted by D«
Hamel, at Yilgarn, includes
repeal of the stock-tax (30 per
cent, per head on imported bul-
locks, by which the Govt,
graziers keep up the price of
meat); other necessaries of life
to be duty-free; water conser-
vation on goldfields, cheap rail-
ways, electoral reform (compris-
ing one-man-one-vote, one-day
elections, triennial Parliaments,
payment of members, simplifi-
cation of registry and transfer),
land reform (including classifi-
cation of land-values with prices
accordingly, selection before
survey and assistance to settlers,
tax on unimproved land, burst-
up of big estates) and economy
generally.
Ministerial replies to mem-
ber Kelly, in N.S.W. Assembly,
disclose that under general
orders applicants for commis-
sions in the local Permanent
Artillery must pass a Univer-
sity examination. Six names
were handed in ; one candidate
passed. A son of Colonel Spald-
ing, who did not pass, was
thereupon attached to the Per-
manent Artillery at .£l2 per
month and allowances; while a
son of Major Airey, who also
failed to pass, was made Acting-
Adjutant of the 2nd Infantry
regiment. Needless to say that
the other unsuccessful candi-
dates were not appointed to
anything. The military caste is
not merely a caste ; it is an
hereditary caste; and the na-
tion which has billeted the
fathers is to be billeted with
the sons also.
In Maoriland, as in N.S.
Wales, imprisonment for debt
has been abolished. When a
man owes money, and the court
orders him to pay it, and he is
not able to pay, he isn’t impri-
soned for the debt but for con-
tempt of court. Year before
last, 749 persons were not im-
prisoned for debt in Maoriland,
butonly for disobeying the court.
Maoriland is a progressive
country, and the law would
shudder at the obtuse barbarity
of shutting a manup in gaol be-
cauaehe is unable to pay. It
only shuts him up because he doesn’t pay.
The courtesy of diplomacy. N.S.W.
Agent-General (Saul Samuel) to N.S.W. Premier
(Dibbs) —per cable :
Pray say no more about this small incident, or you may
do an injury to a very deserving young man who is con-
nected with Lord Jersey. Collect.
Dibbs to Samuel;
Carry out my instructions without further equivoca-
tion, and contradict Peel’s lies.

Q.
P. LUFTIG.
The Sydney Wool Market.
Thb wool season being now at an end only odd lots and
small parcels are received lor sale by the various wool-
brokers. For the convenience of buyers sales are held
fortnightly instead of weekly as in the rush of the season.
This arrangement enables buyers from the Southern
capital to attend our sales, and, consequently, compeli
tion must be increased by their presence. Recent news
from London quotes the market at 5 per cent, lower, and
at the sales this week the market showed a decided
decline in sympathy.
M'Burney, Wallis and Co. held over their catalogue
because they thought it unwise to entrust owners’ in-
terests on the market in the face of such discouraging
news from their London agents.
The results of other brokers’ sales go to show’ that this
firm was correct in their decision not to offer. By hold-
ing for another fortnight, they give the market ample
time to recover. The new firm are to he commended for
their careful protection of small lines, it being a great mis-
take for brokers to rush wool upon the market simply
because the sale-day has come round. Small lots should
receive the same consideration os large, and M'Burney,
Wallis and Co.’s good judgment this week proves that
they have the welfare of their constituents at heart.;

THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL.
In the Legislative Council last evening,
before the dinner-hour, l»r. MacLaunu
arranged that tho Bathing Regulation Bill
should be taken before the further conside-
ration of the Mining on Private Lands Bill,
the only other item of Government business
on the notice paper
One of the provisions of the bill was that all
bathers should be clothed “ from the neck to
the knee,’ Mr.
Hangar, in committee, moved the omission
of the words ** from the neck to the knee
from the bill, and called for a division. It
was found that the uyes and the noes were
even, and the chairman gave his casting vote
in favor of the retention of the words. The
bill was reported to the House without
amendment. Dr. MacLaurin then thought it
7 was 100 late to do anything with the Mining
'lon Private Lands Bill, and the House ad-
journed, shortly before 9 o’clock,till Wed-
nesday next.

When a “swell” down South lately got
six months for fraud, the members of his family
marked the event by going into mourning. Here
is a new idea which is far more logical, in a pro-
fessedly Christian community, than mourning for
the dead.
# # •
The Female Vanguard of Reform already
quarrel as to whether the title of a lady, who may
be elected chief local magistrate, shall be, “Her
Worship the Mayoress,” or “Her Worship the
Mayor.” And what is to be the official title of
the husband of “ Her Worshipful?” When a man
becomes Mayor, -his wife becomes Mayoress. But
when a woman becomes Mayor, what does her
husband become? Answer—a mere cypher.
• * •
Whence do Judges derive the power to
forbid the publication of evidence, as Chief Justice
Darley forbade it in the divorce-case of Te Kloob
versus Te Kloot, heard in Sydney, last week?
First, the Chief Justice ordered that the evidence
should not be published till the case closed, and
afterwards he directed that it should not be
published at all. The point is not whether or not
the order benefited public decency; it is, whether
or not a judge, qua judge, sits invested with the
3»ower thus exercised. In England, George
Jessell, Master of the Rolls, and other eminent
jurists, declare that a judge possesses no such legal
authority, and argue that if he may suppress
evidence because it appears this, that, or the
other, he can suppress all evidence at all times.
* * *
Doesn’t Windeyer, J., give his profession
badly away by assuming that it doesn’t normally
take the view expressed by the late Judge Higin-
botliam when he said that the primary duty of a
defending counsel is, not to secure his client’s
acquittal, right or wrong, but to take care that
accused shall not suffer from inadequate presenta-
tion of the facts in his favour ?
* # *
“ Meet me in church. I’ll keep right
hand on top ledge of pew.” Thus ran an advt. in
a recent Sydney paper ; but after one edition
of the journal was published, the formes were
overhauled and other matter substituted.
Everyone knows
or should, thesehard
times—the aggres-
sive-looking, knotty
walking-stick that a
bailiff always carries.
It is as much part and
pared of him as his
shiny, greasy coat and
stale - beer - laden
breath, and when he
taps gently at your
front door, keeping
well out of eye-range
of the upstairs-win-
dows, he leans non-
chalantly on that
stick and patiently
waits. Open the door
ever so little and the
mischief is done ; for,
as he bids you the
time o’ day, he sur-
reptitiously inserts
the point of that stick
between thedoor edge
—near the hinges—
and the door -jamb,
and nothing short of
breaking the door will
close it. Then he
whistles to his mate,
hiding round the
corner, plants his hoof
in the passage, with-
draws the stick,
breathes hard on you
and you collapse.
Most people are under
the impression that
the “bummer” car-
ries a walking-stick
for protection. They
are wrong. His
breath is his protec-
tion ; the stick is
merely his implement
of “ trade.”
# * *
The organists of
•the five R.C. churches
in Brisbane are
women, to a man;
and yet, so far, there
has been no “shock-
ing scandal.”
The Sydney police revolver idiocy keeps
burstinv out into fresh problems every day. In
the ease of the man whom the Woolloomooloo
policeman threatened to blow a hole through if he
didn’t come from under a bed to be collared : Is
the “cooinan” iustified in pistolling his suspect
when he funks “ going to ground ” after him. If
not, has any be-buttoned barbarian from Bally-
blatherskite more right than the civilised citizen
to threaten “grievous bodily harm”? If not,
again—isn’t it about time the non-hysterioal end
of the community came down squash on this stupid
concession to the nine-day shriekists ?
* * *
The Bulletin is ready to bet, retire recent
arming of the Sydney police with pistols, that
a policeman will commit suicide with his revolver,
or shoot a fellow-constable or an innocent citizen,
or be shot with his own weapon by some criminal
who has snatched it, before any bona-fide burglar
or murderer has bitten the dust per medium of the
newly served-out weapons.

Waverley (Sydney) women’s deputation—
to Railway Commissioners. “Tram-fare_ to
Bondi-Junction is 3d. ; to Woollahra terminus
(same distance), only 2d. Equalise matters ! ”
Commissioners: “Certainly! We’ll charge the
Woollahra people a penny more ! ” Which recalls
a story of Armstrong, the gun-builder. He had a
clerk, no end of a swell, who complained, in an
imperial sort of way, that his desk was too low.
Armstrong: “What remedy do you suggest? ”
“Oh, a highah desk!” Armstrong: “There’s
another I—l’ll1 —I’ll get a shorter clerk ! ”

The only objectors to the electric-light in
Melbourne are the Gas Co. and the demi-monde.
The former dislike it because it interferes with
their business, and the latter because —well, think

An old member sends this to The Bul-
letin : “The Australian Club, Meloourne, is now
run on the lines of a second-class hotel. Its sub-
«oription-fee has been reduced from £5O to £lO.
Each member is allowed to introduce a friend
daily to dinner. It is contemplated giving to
each member permission to introduce a friend to
sleep, breakfast, and lunch at the club. This
latter will obviate the further introduction of
fresh members, as strangers will practically have
all the privileges of members without paying the
entrance-fee. The committee, in view of the latter
innovation, are having the usual notice posted in
the rooms freeing themselves from responsibility
for any theft which may be committed, as in
ordinary hotels.”
* * *
Sydney Mayor’s luncheon was chiefly re-
markable for the ludicrous inconsequence of the
remarks made by travelling-philanthropist Char-
rington. No more absurd oration has ever been
heard under the roof of the building.

One of the divorce-cases down for hearing
in an Australian court turns on the husband’s
allegation that his wife persisted in getting her
hair dressed by a male hair-dresser. The husband
fortifies his case with proof that his wife objected
to his having his own hair dressed by a female
hair-dresser. *

Judge Windeyer, in the Campbell forgeries

Dear Bulletin, — Re Bulletin par., 3rd
March, about the man who, having made a good
race-meeting win, thoughtfully ordered (and paid
for) his own grave-lot and tombstone, you
are slightly in error. The tombstone in question
remained in the monumental mason’s yard till
recently, when its owner got married again, and,
with a delicacy and a presence of mind which did
him infinite credit, stowed it away for future use.
“ Look at me,”
cried a lately-elected
Sydney suburban
alderman, addressing

“I never drank,

Nepotism seems rife in the N.S.W. Per-

cratic Judge and his associate dropped over a hun-
dred to the pair a few weeks back. First “ solo,”
and then baccarat. His Honor paid up smilingly
and thought it was luck. Sometimes madame
wins, sometimes monsieur, but they get there just

The accomplished Mr. Julian Ashton
places himself in a wrong and undignified position
by remaining trustee of N.S.W. National Art
Gallery while continuing in professional practice
as an artist. It is not enough for Mr. Ashton to
say that he do sn’t judge his own pictures, or to
plead (in effect) that even if he does judge his
rival artists’ pictures he judges them justly. Mr.
Justice Innes is also a member of the art-trust,
but he would decline to sit on the Supreme Court
Bench in any case in which he was even colorably
interested. Mr. Ashton, being human, must have
at least a colorable personal interest in his brother
artists’ work. He should, therefore, resign
either his trusteeship or his professional practice.
* * *
The prudent regulation which prevents
Ms.P. from becoming Government contractors
should apply abo in the case of Mr. Julian Ash-
ton’s N.S.W, Art Gallery trusteeship. Either he
should not be a trustee or he should not sell pic-
tures to the trustees. As long as the connection
continues, it will be a scandal and a stumbling-
block, however unreasonably, to both Mr. Ashton
and his colleagues.

A metropolitan temperance hotel-keeper,
with his business edge finely sharpened, wrote to
the clerics who have been holding assemblies and
conferences in Sydney lately, inviting them to put
up at his palace, and stating that payment for the
accommodation need not be made till they have
settled down again in their country homes.
Minister for Education Suttor (N.S.W.)
has just refused to sanction the taking up of a
collection among the much - retrenched female
school teacher’s for the purpose of testirnouialising
Under-Secretary Johnson, whose present lament-
able state of health is not unlikely to enforce his
retirement in the near future. By the way, the
moneys collected for another official testimonial
which didn’t come off, and which were long sup-
pi isfd to have been returned, have never, in the
case of some, of the country subscribers, been
received to this day, despite repeated applications
for same.
» • #
The head-mistresses who attempted to
make Under-Secretary Johnsob, of N.S.W. Edu-
cation Department, recipient of a testimonial from
them, and were repulsed by the Minister, were
unofficially apprised before they scattered that
they could keep the enthusiasm boiling, as, on the
day a Civil servant resigns he is eligible for such a
mark of respeot.
David Gaunson, spouting for Mil g
th o Mercantile case, observed tla a ” * *

philosophical mind. Hemight laveati e< u■' ” ,

it would have been only gracious o ,ann.
admit that his client warn t stuck

general. Altogether, the tune was no p? y
suitable for Mr. Gaunson s allusion.
Why should a solici-
tor to whom a hundred
or a thousand pounds is
handed for a specific
purpose, and who mis-
applies that money, ever
be allowed “ time?” His
position as an “ officer of
the Supreme Court”
makes him more than
the trusted employe of
the man who remits, and
more than the trusted
bailee of the man who is
supposed to receive. If
a mercantile clerk mis-
applied money entrusted
to him by his employer
he would, in plain
language, be promptly
“lagged.” The Supreme
Court is an institution
which often privileges
Thieves I—with 1 —with a capital
T. The attorney who
embezzles —for that is the
word—his client’s money
should go to gaol,
whether he pays up or
whether he doesn’t.
The N.S. Wales Instruction Department
authorities now find that their regulation, decree-
ing that female teachers, upon marrying, vnu-t
leave the service, cannot be legally enforced
unless all moneys and interest thereon paid into
the Superannuation Fund by such teachers are
refunded—and the N.S.W. Superannuation Fond
doesn’t feel well enough to stand that. However,
in some instances, the mere “bluff” has had the
desired effect, and a few teachers have sent in
their resignations, which were eagerly accepted.
One lady, when applying for a Sydney school,
stated incidentally that it would be but for a few
months, as she was shortly to be married. She
mentioned the date, which the department must
have noted, for soon after the stated day she
received an official letter reminding her that her
resignation had not been received. But the mar-
riage has been postponed indefinitely, and the
department is still whistling for her resignation.

A Melb. paper points out, as a matter of
interest to K.C.M.G.’s and others, that the wife
of a common knight is not a “ Lady ” at all, but
only a “ Dame.” Therefore, when she calls herself
“ Lady ” she assumes a bogus title, and when she
airs her sham distinction at Govmentouse it is
the duty of the Private-Secretary to suppress
her. “Dame,” regarded as a title, sounds tolerably
common, and is only a shade better than that
worn by the ancient crone who used to be called
“ Old Goody Smith ” in English village-tales.

Melbourne was lighted by electricity last
week, the current being formally turned on by
the Mayoress. Then “ the company adjourned to
the Town Hall and partook of refreshments.”
They always do, somehow. It is one of the worst
features in the Anglo-Saxon’s character that on
every important or unimportant occasion he par-
takes of refreshments. He never does anything
without partaking of refreshments. Whether he
is struck by a great happiness or a great disaster
it is all one—he immediately partakes of refresh-
ments. When the Last Day comes the last of the
race will celebrate the occasion by partaking of
refreshments all by himself. It is in the blood.
Refreshments are the last thing the man of British
descent has before he is hanged. If he is
going to be flogged he has refreshments. When
the doctor sounds him and tells him that he has
got a mortal disease which will presently cut him
off, he sets his teeth hard so as to conceal any
trace of emotion, and- goes out and partakes of
refreshments. He greets every visitor of unusual
importance by trying to make him eat more than
is good for him, and he bids farewell to every
departing friend by giving him a horrible bilious
attack. There is nobody else on this earth who is
so consistent and so persevering in the matter of
refreshments. Refreshments are his god. It is
generally supposed that money is his god, but it
isn’t; he only values money as a means towards
partaking of refreshments.

The most patient woman on earth obtained
a judicial separation last week in Sydney. She
was married in ’55, and two years later her hus-
band deserted her for another woman. He has
stuck to the other woman ever since, and his wife,
after 37 years of solitary communing with herself,
reckoned that she had waited long enough, and
applied to the court for relief. The Judge—by
way of hidden humour, mayhi—ordered the
question of alimony to stand over.

Clements Tonic as a most valuable medicine- 1
don’t believe there has been a greater sufferer in

extreme weakness and continual langour ami

you what their medicines cost me or how much I
used ; I derived no benefit from them and found
myself getting weaker daily. Having no faith in

marvellous, before I had finished two bottles 1

If a man were to stand up in a public

Melbourne of to day. Every accusation in it cuts
home, which shows that human nature doesn’t

Dear Bulletin,— -Members of a Brisbane
woman’s rights society call each other “old
maids” in their anger. It shows, whilst the
shrieking sisterhood pretend to despise man, how
much they redly value his judgment. The old
maid, in the general presumption, has failed to
ph ase man, therefore, “old maid ” is a term of
opprobrium. And it stings. The epithet was
hurled at an unmarried member of a female com-
mittee in Ballarat, a few years back. “ Old
maid !” was the fierce retort. “That’s all you
know !” When women fight, man begins to dis-
cover his own importance. —Yours, Snell.

Of a.fine hlack clotti clerical coat, trimmed with frogs

the Moderator swelled till he exploded. Where’s

That “respec-
table” Maoriland
paper, the N.Z.
Times, has inven-
ted a way whereby
the law can get
level wi th suicides.
When any person’s
remains are con-
victed of self-mur-
der, the Times
proposes that all
property left by
the deceased
should be confis-
cated, so that his
widow and chil-
dren will be left
to starve. The
law won’t exactly
get level with the
suicide by this
process, but it will
take it out of his
family, which, to
the pious section
of the community,
is almost as good.
If there is no pro-
perty to be con-
fiscated, perhaps a
good effect might
be produced by
flogging the sui-
cide’s wife and
daughters, but
this is a matter
for after-conside-
ration.

A remarkable sample of justice, according
to the honorary J.P., is reported from Melbourne.
Late one night, a desire to kill somebody
possession of a gentleman afflicted with ' jim-
jams.” Accordingly, he burst into the house of
Arthur Turner, and rushed at that gentleman
with a razor. Turner got out of bed and fled
round the room, just in time to save himself from
being disembowelled, and after an active scrim-
mage he floored the invading maniac with an iron
bar, that being the first thing which came handy.
Then the police took the drunken gentleman to
the hospital and ran the other in, arid the Carlton
J.’sP. solemnly lectured him on the sin of violently
attacking the inebriate who ran amok at him in
the night, and fined him ss. for assault.
* • f
This decision should just about finish the
cheap and nasty J.P. as an administrator of
justice. If it is absolutely necessary, in a
corrupt community, that there should be some
low-priced distinction with which the local poli-
tician can reward his supporters, they should
either be made J.’sP. without any power to sit on
the bench and publicly expose their incapacity, or
some new' fragment: of the alphabet ought to be
fixed up. The only thing that is really wanted is
the right to trail sundry letters after the un-
distinguished cognomen of John Jones, and if
that person was made an lOU it would be just
as satisfactory. Also, be might be made P.N. or
N.S.F., which would do equally well, or he
might simply be created XYZ, which should be
a satisfying distinction for any small potentate.
Anyhow, the J.P. business is a failure.

A new idea, anyhow ; “ Dear Bulletin, —
Has it ever struck you that it is the advocates of
women’s suffrage who know least about women ?
To the average male is turned a conventional
mask often worn with such consummate hypocrisy
as to deceive the wearer. There is only one class
which has a sufficiently intimate acquaintance
with female nature to impartially judge its in-
finite frailties. I want women’s suffrage investi-
gated by a jury of thoroughly-qualified rakes.—

A Victorian farmer lately went to Mel-
bourne for a razzle-dazzle. Proceedings began
with the usual drunk and the usual female who is
always “ laying for ” the bnsh-dazzler in his festive
hours. Then there was the wonted interval of
oblivion, after which the patient woke up penni-
less and contrite. But he also woke with a faint,
far-away recollection of some shadowy circum-
stance that seemed to loom up like a pinnacle from
a dead waste of decomposed beer-memories, and
when he had time to sort out his thoughts this
circumstance became clear to him. It his obfus-
cated state he bad married the female above-
ra ntioned. The record of the marriage was found
in the books of a certain local parson, but though
the lady’s name, or the name site used, is
there, she can’t be identified. Therefore, the
sobered buslunan has only the knowledge
that he owns a wife somewhere, whom he
doesn’t know from Adam, and even if the
lady, or someone who professes to be her,
turns up, he won’t be able to decide whether she is
the right lady or not, so that if he acknowledges
her he may get into divorce difficulties with a
previous husband, and if he doesn’t acknowledge
her he may be ultimately gaoled for desertion or
non-payment of maintenance money. All which
goes to prove that both parties to a marriage
ought to be arrested and put in solitary confine-
ment —either with or without chains—for seven
days previous to the ceremony, so that if either
of them happens to be drunk, he, or she, may
have a fair chance of sobering up prior to the
ceremony. Then, if the seven days’ probation
finds them both sober and still of the same mind,
they could have a warm bath, and have their hair
fixed up properly by the State, and be married
by the gaol-chaplain, with the governor of the
prison and a policemen and two female warders
for witnesses, and be sent on their way rejoicing.
A soldier, who served with the British
army during the Indian mutiny, has published
the story of that gory episode from a new stand-
point, and his book is making a sensation in
England. The following is an extract from a
review :
One hundred and eighteen women and 92 children were
hacked to pieces (at Cawnpore), and the sight of these
as they lay imperfectly buried in the well must have been
a maddening one; but we do not so well know how this
massacre was revenged. After the revolting deed General
Neil issued an order to the following effect: —“ After trial
and condemnation, all prisoners found guilty of having
taken part in the slaughter are to be taken into the
slaughter-house by the scavengers - men of the lowest-
cast es—and there made to crouch down and lick clean a
square foot of the blood-soaked floor.” The floor was
first damped, and if the miserable wretches refused to do
it, they were flogged into obedience. The square foot
being cleaned up in this way, they were then hanged.
A'd the general has justified his conduct by writing:
“No one who has witnessed the scenes of murder,
mutilation and massacre can ever listen to the word
‘ mercy ’ as applicable to these fiends.” On another
page we are told of one who was smeared over
with pigs’ fat, flogged by sweepers, and then hanged ;
and it seems to have been a common thing to
make prisoners break caste by forcing pork upon them,
if not by the tribunals, at any rate by the ranks. It was,
in fact, a war of downright butchery, each side seeming
to outvie the other in meroilessness. Many a time were
natives smothered in smoke fumes. As a rule, the natives;
caught were tried by officers accompanying the army,
and the trial often became a parody on justice and a
protraction of cruelty. It is only fair to say that Sir
Colin disapproved of much that was done, and
so did Lord Canning, who was nicknamed in
consequence by the English “Clemency” Canning.
When Lucknow was taken the loot was incredible. A
lieutenant got a crescent and star ornament which was
said to have sold in London for £BO,OOO, and in a week the
prize agents got over a million and a-quarter of English
money. The plunder was supposed to be divided among
those who served in the.xelief and capture of the city, but
many are known to have had far more than their share,
for while each private got something like 505., there were
many higher in the ranks who were able to redeem mort-
gaged estates, and to purchase fishing grounds and
shooting boxes. One instance is given of an estate being
cleared of a mortgage of £lBO,OOO within two years of the
mutiny, and it is inferred that loot did it. Soldiers^went
mad with pillage and got “drunk with plunder.”

Professor Thulinius.—My Dear Sir,—l feel I should be want-
ing in duty, did I neglect the opportunity of sending you my
testimony as to the wondrous efficacy of your rheumatic
specific. For the past ten years I have been a complete
martyr to rheumatism in all its forms. I have tried doctors
. . . . with a view of effecting a cure for this most trying
disease. .... I am well-known, and scores can testify
that at best I could only crawl about with difficulty. . . .
After leaving Little Bay Hospital at the close of last year I
was persuaded to try a bottle of your “ Thulinius,” and in a
week or so afterwards I could get about fairly well. Upon
again suffering a relapse last February, I took another bottle,
with an equally successful result; but at last 1 determined to
go through a course of treatment, and 1 have just completed
my fourth bottle, with the gratifying knowledge that I am
quite free from pain, can walk any reasonable distance with-
out fatigue, have an excellent appetite, and feel myself again
competent to re-enter my profession, added to which my oft-
repeated attacks of pleurisy have become a thing of the past.
I have not dieted myself in any way, so all the credit is due to
your wonderful remedy, under Providence, that my blood is
becoming purer daily* and its effect upon my liver and kid-
neys most pronounced. ... I shall only be too glad
personally to convince fellow-sufferers of the benefits to be
derived from a course of your treatment, as exemplified in
my own case, after ten years’ martyrdom.—l remain, yours
faithfully, W. H. NEWTON NEWMAN (Teacher of Elocution
and twenty-five years Actor and Manager)

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Poor Paddy M‘Gowan will be remembered by
all who saw his finishes for the Caulfield and Australian
Cup when he had Vengeance under him. On each occa-
sion he got the Ballarat horse home by a nose by sheer
determination and the strictest attention to business. At
Caulfield he had to chase Loyalstone all down the straight
and the difference between Paddy riding Vengeance, and
James Hayes walloping away at Loyalstone, with his
excited head turning round to see himself being over-
taken, was a terrible sight for the backers of Loyalstone.
Poor little Paddy never looked over his shoulder when a
result was trembling in the balance. Which reminds one
that the blind eye spared him a good deal of temptation.

Jookey-slaughter cannot be treated with in-
difference. There will be a re-action against the coolness
with which it is surveyed.

They have threepenny bookmakers in Melbourne
now—individuals who look like Joe Thompson viewed
through the wrong end of a telescope. One of the most
enterprising of them is said to have started with a capital
of a halfpenny.

’Twill come. M'Gowan, killed on-the flat the
other day, gave up steepling, because it was so dangerous.

Jockey M'Gowan left .£3ooo—about the same
as Mick O’Brien.
The Maoriland cricketers having shown such
good form, the next eleven should be Australasian— not
Australian.
« • *
The stocky, nuggety man is at a disadvantage
in glove contests, for he cannot close and wrestle as he
could under the old P.R. rules. The case of Mace will
serve as an illustration. In his very best days there were
cleverer men with the gloves, who would not dare to face
him in the ring. For a pugilist, Mace was a very good
wrestler, and it was to this as much as anything else
that his victories over giants like King and Hurst were
due. Modern glove affairs demand less than half the
skill and courage of the old P.R.

J. E. Snell, who broke Frank Toms’ overland
cycling record, intends to try and bust his own record
again. Snell is a model cyclist, scales list. 51b., with not
an oz. of fat, and has not ruined his constitution by com-
peting in fast races. Champions like Dick Davis, Tom
Busst, and Turner would be nowhere on a long, rough
trip. Similarly, Toms, who beat Scott’s record, is a
second-rater in an Austral wheel race.
# # *
E. Jones, the lightning S.A. bowler, would be
worth his place in an Australian Eleven for fielding alone.
In the outfield for S.A. against Vic. he performed wonder-
fully.
# * *
J. Reedman, who made 113 for S.A. against
Vic., showed the best cricket of the match. His cutting
was almost a revelation, and reminds one of Percy
M'Donnell—where, by the way, is Percy M‘Donnell, now?
Reedman is a teetotaller, and a good all-round athlete,
and would have immensely strengthened the last
Australian Eleven.

Cripps, the owner and trainer of Tarcoola, told
his friends to back his horse for the Australian Cup,
saying that it was quite as well as when it won the Mel-
bourne Cup. Allowing that Carnage was not thoroughly
equal to a fast 2-mile race in November last, there is still
no accounting for the defeat of Jeweller and Portsea by
Tarcoola.

Australian horse-worship, as distinguished from
love of betting, was shown when the “ time ” for Portsea's
Champion Race appeared on the board. Those who won
their money had applauded the hoisting of Portsea’s
number. The hoisting of the time-record was received
with cheers from many people who, though they might
have lost their wagers, oould still raise some enthusiasm
over the performance of a good horse for the horse’s sake.
• ft *
Portsea and Light Artillery raced their rivals
almost to a standstill. Patron was fairly baked at the
finish, Sailor Prince looked as any human prince would
look after galloping three miles under a broiling sun, and
the over-rated Admiral (for whom the Prince was sup-
posed to be “ making a pace”) was gasping and trembling
long after his return to the paddock. As for Hova, the
leggy flyer who hadn’t been trained or tried to run the
Champion course—well, they had to fetch the doctor to
Hova. Mr. Sep. Miller suggested that the horse’s heart
was broken. Only two days back Hova had followed up
his Newmarket victory by winning a seven-furlong race
with scarcely an effort. Yet in the Champion this unfor-
tunate dandy had been last all the way. Hales made one
attempt to get near the front, but the others were going
too fast for the tiring sprinter.

Jones (S. A.) emerges as the bowler of the fag-
end of a century. Although last year his prestige was
not what it is now, there were knowing ones who urged
his inclusion in the All-Australia Eleven. Murdoch had
spotted him.
* * *
A miserable field in the Champion ! The V.R.O.
will be inclined to knock it out altogether, for indeed this
race, on the whole, atfter a long trial, proves a failure.
The idea used to be to galvanise up the Derby, Champion,
or some weight tor age event, to oust Melb. Cup, on the
precedent of the Epsom Derby, but it rather appears that

John Roberts has successfully given Mitchell
9000 in 24,000 at spot-barred billiards. Mitchell had
much the best of the game up to the close of the second
evening, but when he came to the scratch on the third he
quite disgusted the spectators. Roberts, by way of keep-
ing the company in good humour, played as even he has
seldom played in his life. At latest he was engaged in a
match for money at the same odds with Peall.

Altogether 1126 runs were made in the Vic.-
S.A. match in Adelaide, so that bowlers’ averages suffered
except O. M’Leod’s, who is probably now the best bowler
in Australia on a billiard-table wicket. By defeating
Victoria, S.A. holds the Sheffield Shield, and, taken all
round, that province’s cricket was about the best this
season. The great Giffen got going in nearly every
innings in the four matches and has an average of 75,
Moses being next with 42. Against Victoria last week
Jones, the snowy-haired wonder, clean bowled six wickets
in the last innings and thus won the match, taking three
wickets in four balls. Had S.A. had Jarvis behind the
sticks she would have won very easily. Each team had a
terrible tail, the last five S.A. batsmen being worth about
10 runs among them, and the Vies, were much the same.
Jack Harry was the best Vic. batsman, but S.A. honors
were divided among Giffen, Reedman, Lyons and Dar-
ling. Had Victoria defeated S.A. the Sheffield Shield
would have gone to N.S.W. on the basis of averages, an
absurd system which the two former provinces will oppose
next season. The best way is that in the event of a tie
next year S.A. should continue to hold the shield,
N.S.W. bowlers got splendid averages on wet wickets this
season, but surely that does not alone entitle that province
to superiority ; yet it turns the balance if the averages are
reckoned. By-the-way, the shield will be finished in a
month’s time, and will probably be placed in the Adelaide
Oval.

Mr. D. A. Yindin, well-known in Sydney

such large prices cannot be obtained now as three

The aboriginal name of a certain N.S.W.
township, as given by Judge Windeyer, was
Mungadalla-ringadalla-lalla-lalla-lat-lat, and some-
one writes inS.M. Herald that this “ recalls the
sound of rippling water.!’ It also recalls to any-
body who has seen an English hanging the solemn
reading of the burial-service, the ringing of the
gaol-bell, and the clatter of the falling gallows-
trap. You can imagine anything.
Lord Bonington, one of Hingland’s serious
minded noblemen, doles out every year a few lbs.
of coal to each of the poor tenants on his estates.
These little donations are not altogether free, see-
ing that each poor tenant is requested, by a card
attached to his coals, to “Pray for the soul of
Edith Maud, Countess of Loudoun,” &o. His
lordship evidently fears that Edith has got into
trouble, and the fuel is meant to excite sympathy.
As soon as the poor tenant has worked up a
blazing fire, he thinks of the late Countess and
kneels down to pray.
Dear Bulletin, —Edinburgh is no longer a
British subject ! What of that? He’s more than
one subject elsewhere. Thus William Cullen
Bryant, in Indian Miscellany, 1877 : “On his
late visit to Canada, Prince Alfred spent a day
among the Mohawks of Grand River, and was
complimented by being chosen to a chieftainship
second in rank to that of Tekarihogea, the principal
sachem. ... In the event of war, his royal
highness will be the lieutenant of Tekarihogea,
and in council he pledged the honour of a prince,
that he would be found at the side of that chief
when the summons came.” Whoop! What a
suitable present a profuse scalp-lock would be to
brother Tummy! —Greg Doyle.
R.C. Archbishop John Joseph Lynch, of
Toronto, Canada:—
I have been often pained and astonished at the frequent
appeals of editors and proprietors of newspapers to their
subscribers, urging them to pay their just debts.
Cal holies, at least, cannot be unaware of their obligations
in this matter, and that absolution to a penitent heartily
sorry for his sins does not free him from the obligation of
paying his debts. The atonement for oblivion of justice
in this world will certainly be exacted in the next. The
editors and proprietors of newspapers, on their part, give
their time, the product of a high education and experi-
ence, together with their money for stationery, printing,
and wages to employees, and they expect and should
have, in common justice, a return often by no means
adequate to their outlay. A man who will not pay for a
paper he subscribed for, read, and whose contents ho
enjoyed, is a retainer of another man’s goods.
Quite right. Hell is the place where defaulting
subscribers go; also people who borrow news-
papers instead of buying them.
Dear Bulletin, — In reply to “Jerry.”
To the late Capt. “Bobby” Towns belongs the
honour of introducing the first Kanakas to
Queensland. The first labour vessel was the King
Oscar, Capt. Gibbons, and the historical Ross
Lewin was supercargo. The. Kanakas were in-
tended for sugar and cotton plantations on the
‘Logan River. Their advent on the Barcoo was
some years later. In 1874, Capt. Mackay, the
.unrequited discoverer of the Q. sugar town-site of
the same name, came to Brisbane with a long-
keeled English brig and took a cargo of returns
from Capt. Hope’s plantation of Clanland.
Ignorant of the recruiting grounds of his prede-
cessors in the trade, and conversant with any
group from Chili to Japan, he some months after-
wards returned to Rockhampton with a ship-load
of light copper-coloured, stalwart men and long-
haired maidens, most of whom went to the
Barcoo. It was rumoured that they came from
some group bordering on the China seas, and some
years afterwards the Government had considerable
difficulty in finding ships to take them back,—•
Yours, Pazzareo.
One of woman’s great ambitions is to be
between 20 and 25 years of age; when once she
lets go her hold of 25 she is desperate, and doesn’t
mind what age she becomes. This leads to curious
results in the census, as revealed by some British
figures. For instance, one census will show that
there are in the country, perhaps a million girls
between 10 and 15 years. If they all survived,
next census, taken ten years later, would show a
million women aged between 20 and 25, but al-
lowing for deaths there should not be more than
900,000. Yet it often happens that there are
actually more than a million, from which it would
appear that the girl between 15 and 20 never dies
but rather increases in number. This discrepancy,
however, is steadily diminishing; as education
advances, a woman ceases to care what age she is.
Education does more to suppress personal vanity
than anything under the sun. When physiology
is taught in schools, and children become ac-
quainted, at an early age, with horrible diagrams
of portions of themselves which look like exag-
gerated ox-livers, a good deal of the poetry goes
out of life. It is questionable if a woman whoknew
anatomy thoroughly could take much interest in
her own age. The ox-liver aspect of things would
always be with her, more or less.

Tenders will be received up to 12 noon, Satur-

necessarily accepted.
The machinery is all in perfect working order.
Attention is drawn to the fact that during the
last campaign of the furnace combined charges of
copper and silver ores resulted most successfully,
and large quantities of each are known to exist in
the syndicate’s properties and in the immediate
neighbourhood.
The inability of the Directors to call up further
capital to more fully develope the mines since the
late financial disasters is the sole reason for this
step being taken.

Afc Watson’s Paragon Hotel, Sydney, there
is a stable-stall laid down with “cork paving”
—a composition claimed to be superior to all
other paving for the purpose for which it is used.
It is extremely durable, soft for horses to stand
upon by reason of its elasticity; it is also non-
absorbent and inodorous. That it makes a dry,
warm, and sanitary flooring has been proved by
its use for three years. If horse-owners would let
their horses have something comfortable to rest
upon after a heavy day, hard-worked animals
would last years longer than they do now. While
standing on a hard pavement horses soon puff
their legs by stamping to get rid of flies.
Dear Bulletin. — A few details of the
inner workings of the Surveys conducted under
Melb. Metropolitan Board of Works. The jobs
are contracted for, and certain regulations and re-
strictions are hedged around the successful ten-
derer to ensure proper performance of the work
and fair treatment of his employes. One of
these rules is, that no work is to be sub-let, and
that all wages must be paid at least oncea fortnight.
How are they observed ? There has, I believe,
been hardly a single block upon which fully one-
third of the work was not sub let, and on one
I took some work the profits of which had filtered
through two hands ere they reached yours truly ;
and as for the latter bye-law, I know few firms of
surveyors who carry out its provisions. One
contractor, on being importuned by a man to whom
he owed over .£2O, offered him two shillings on
account, another to whom I was holding out for a
large payment and instancing my liabilities, cut
me short with “That nothing, one man’s got the
bailiffs in. ” On the job where I was last employed
I got thirty shillings a week, sketching and mea-
suring, and had sometimes to wait as Jong as eight
weeks for my money ; on no occasion was my
salary less than a month in arrear. I had with
me a chainman and a boy. The former, a mar-
ried man with several children, received the
princely remuneration of 15s. a week, while 4s.
(a penny an hour) sufficed for the nipper. The
salaries usually paid are: Instrument men, sup-
plying their own “ jigger,’’ from £2 to 50s. a week.
Sketehers and measurers from .£1 to 30s. Chain-
men, anything under the latter figure, and boys
from 14 upwards, from 3/6 to ss. The boys do,
or are supposed to do, the work formerly done by
men at 6s. per day, but the youngsters are not
particular to an inch or two, or even a foot or two,
for that matter, in taking measurements, hence
the accuracy of the work is questionable; but
unless errors are so glaring that the Board returns
the plans to be re-done, the profits are all on the
contractor’s side and the risk is worth taking.
The highest-paid of the above are skilled men who
have, as a rule, served an apprenticeship for a term
of years, and in many instances paid a premium
for the privilege, and with all, holidays and wet
days and days absent through sickness are
vigorously docked from the pay of those on salary,
even from the boys’ 3/6, and repairs to tapes, poles,
etc., have also to be paid from the workers’ pockets.
The hours are from eight to ten, per diem, and as
the nature of the work necessitates standing the
whole of the time, the former seems quite long
enough. In addition to this there remains the
fact that towards the end of a job all hands have
in many cases a very fair chance of being “left ”
for some weeks’screw and with no earthly show
of ever getting it in full. Certainly, if sufficiently
strong representations be madeby the unfortunates,
the Board will compel the surveyor to make a
statutory declaration that all his employes have
been paid, before granting him his final certificate ;
but the said certificate is often not large enough
to meet all the outstanding amounts, so adiv. of
so many shillings in the .£ is all one gets. Couple
the above with the facts that the boss is continually
growling about lost time, slow work, etc., that
we have to answer all the silly questions of the
people whose houses we enter, and you will have
some sort of an idea what a rosy billet we have.
Contrast the action of London County Council
who rule that on all contracts under them shall
the standard wage be paid, and sees that its orders
are carried out, while the Southern corporation
simply sends an official about occasionally to yarn
with the surveyor, ask a few employes a few
questions, which they must either lie to or lose
their billets, and who returns reporting satisfac-
tion. But the former body has live men like
Rosebery and John Burns among its members,
while the Vic. one is composed entirely of subur-
ban mayors and aldermen of the type of Thomas
Bent, the furious Mangel Wurzel man from South
Brighton.—McG.

DOMESTIC ECONOMY!
WHAT IS IT ?
DOMESTIC ECONOMY is primarily the art of feeding and clothing the family at as low a rate as possible,
without impairing the family digestion, or taking away the character of its members for being well and com-
fortably dressed. Domestic economy is not comprised in buying a bad article for sixpence when better can be
got for sevenpence ; but if the ruling price for the best is eightpenoe, and somebody comes along and offers it for
sevenpence, then it’s domestic economy to close with the merchant so offering. By all means study this great
and glorious science of social life, because its due and proper observance cannot fail to make poor people rich, and
rich ones richer. What say you ? Will you do your business at
THO3XT Y H° RDERMT’S ?

The immense Westralian concessions granted to
an English crowd—the Hampton Plains syndicate—abut
on Coolgardie, as the world knows. The syndicates claims
to own all the minerals in their territory. Should rich
gold be found within the grant (which is more than likely)
and thousands of miners rash the place, which would ha
a dead certainty, we shall see—what we shall see. Thera
is no force in Australia that can deal with 10,000 men of the
sort who go gold-digging. The Hampton Plains syndicated
may have to whistle for “ their” gold.

David Lindsay, back at Coolgardie from the
new rush, brought three nuggets—62 oz., 52 oz. and 30 oz.
—water, he reports, was retailed at 2s. per gal. (it after-
wards rose to 55.); flour, 2s. per lb. Between the rush
and Coolgardie is a waterless 50 miles; 6000 oz. gold
(another account says 2000 oz.) found to date. Field rich,
but patchy.

Privileges enjoyed by prospectors at the new
Coolgardie rush:—Clements, crawling on his hands and
knees, too exhausted to walk, was the first to return,
with several ounces in his pouch, and glorious news of the
rich find on his lips. Two days of semi-delirium followed,
during which he was spoon-fed in the first camp he
struck. Massey’s party next appeared, represented by
one who said ail four camels on which they’had travelled
were forty miles distant, being knocked up after ten days
without water. During the two days employed in this
P6scue, Jones, the pedestrian, was wandering in the scrub,
subsisting’on a bit of stale damper, blood falling from hig
nostrils. In his direst extremity, when stark naked, he
was staggering, almost a maniac, under the burning sun,
he struck the camel-pad and found a billycan of water
left by the rescue patty for some of their comrades in the
rear.

Dear Bulletin, —We were discussing the com-
parative merits of D.T.’s and never-touch-its in an
Arizona (U.S.A.) raiiway-oaiyiage. The dispute waxed
hot, and was at last referred to a wild, gaunt, hairy-
toothed miner from the hills, who had silently spat and
sprawled all over the carriage, without taking any part in
the wrangle. ‘‘What’s my notion o’ water? W-a-a-1,
boys, I’m no jedge. Some" say it’s a good thing ; some
say it’s a bad thing. 1 dunno. I never tasted it." What
price that man as a W.A. prospector?—Yours, Austra-
lian.

Editor Bulletin, —I enclose a few clippings to
give yon an idea of the water question at Coolgardie.
Al>out the end of May is plenty of time for people to
think of going there, unless each man has £lOO behind
him. It may rain at Coolgardie to-morrow, but it may
also not rain thereuntil June. By the way, judging by the
almost entire absence of birds, animals, and, conse-
quently, of natives, I believe the average rainfall at Cool-
gardie must be nearer 7in. than 14in.—C.D. Perth, 9th
Feb., 1894.
* * *
Western Australia, according to Zebina Lane,
consists of “sand, sandal-wood, tinned meat and niggera”
Mostly tinned meat and niggers. Zeb. is on his way to
England, to float some Coolgardie properties.
m * *
A quarter of an inch of rain has fallen in the
Coolgardie district. Estimated that 2000 oz. picked up at
the new alluvial rush, Kurnalpi, for week ended March 3.
Whiteman, of S.A., picked up lOOoz. ; Mills, of Melb., was
another lucky one. The unlucky ones don’t want their
names mentioned.
Accounts from the Wyalong goldfield over-
shadow all other N.S.W. mining news, though it has only
sprang into prominence wiihin the past fortnight. Pros-
pecting has long been going on, and the new find is in an
old and favourably-known mining district, 40 miles from
'femora, 84 from Forbes and Young, and 17 from Bar-
medman. The country is mostly flat scrub, but there is
good water and cheap provisions. There are from 1000
to 2000 men on the ground, and crowds flocking.
There are said to be 40 claims on payable gold—
mostly in narrow ironstone veins, easily worked. The
best claim, Neild’s, has a quartz reef heavily charged with
pyrites. Several crushing*, totalling 100 tons, from
various claims average over 3oz. The Warden and others
consider the field permanent, and likely (given enough
water for crushing) to employ many men when machines
are on the ground.

At Hillgrove, Baker’s Creek is looking well, and
rich specimens were found in the big reef, giving 630 z.
from two hags Slone. The fortnight's crushing was 433

The shadow of another reduction at Broken

A Barrier Miner correspondent suggests that
stoppage of work at White Cliffs opal fields is due partly
to an intention of the leaseholders to work the ground
themselves now it has been thoroughly prospected by

time.

John Plumper Hoolan has resigned his
seat in Q. Parliament in favour of Labour-leader

with his intentions, Hoolan said—“ God has been

The fourth number of Under Lock and

life sentence for murder, and who ought to have
been hanged, if ever capital punishment were
justifiable, gets the Home News regularly.”
Dear Bulletin, —Your contributor of 24th
Feb. makes a grievous error re W. R. Wilson,
whom he evidently does not know so well as does
the present writer. There are scores who, had it
not been for Mr. Wilson’s kindly advice, would
now be working hard for a living. And during
the last days of the silver boom none wrote off bad
debts with a freer hand, instead of keeping them
hanging over his debtors’ heads till better times,
than W. R. Wilson —a white man for more like
whom the world would be a lot better. — Miner,

Well-rounded. By Mr. Fitchett :
On Sunday night the southern and western skies were
all aflame with the Aurora Australis. Soft crimson clouds
stretched almost from the horizon to the zenith, pulsating
with waves now of fainter and now of richer colour, and
shot through at irregular intervals with faint vibrations
of ice coloured light. It was a beautiful sight, and was
made yet more beautiful and mysterious as the spectator
thought of the huge far-off icebergs somewhere in the
direction of the South Pole which caught on their
splintered peaks and crystalline slopes the rays of a far-
off sun, broke them up into their elementary colours, and
flung them through leagues of space on to the midnight
arch of the Australian sky.
N.S. Wales Commandant Hutton, after
bravely encouraging the partially - paid forces
under his command to accept their reduced pay—
first, from =£l2 to £9 125., and then from £9 l2s.
to £6 per annum—with the “pluck” of “sol-
diers,” has given publicity to his revised list of
salary for the “ permanent ” hirelings. This list
shows an increase of salaries among five “officers,”
amounting to £395 per annum ; a new appointment
(“Mounted Brigade, 2nd in Command”) of .8700
per annum ; increases to three non-commissioned
officers of <B29 —£1 (!), £l6 and £l2; and de-
cmises to non-com.’s totalling £251. Thus Mr. Hut-
ton’s economies with respect to “permanents”
represent —increases, £8124 ; decreases, £251; or
an increase of £7873. Yet the Com. doesn’t claim
to be an Irishman.
Mr. Edw. J. Rigby, manager of the
Otis Engineering Co., writes Since our last report we
have made extensive sales of the Otis crusher, which is
fast coming into favour, the following mining com-
Pa ßroken V Hifl Proprietary Ou for "one of Me No. 8 Otis
crushers which is used for dry crushing in their amalga-
Zn.' 1 ! “'ll* a ; ,d “i e ra . a " age -’ Mr - f Hcw f n * states it is
doing excellent work and turning out crushed ore at the
rate of 16ewts. per hour through a screen of 3600 holes
per square inch, a larger return than from any 15-head of
their big stamper battery. The Proprietary Go. are now
arranging for two more crushers in their new concentrat-
m gp ,ai ' t " „
The Hon. John A. Wallace has purchased the No. 3
crusher from the defunct Loyola mine, and it is being
placed in position on his Bethanga works and will be used
for dry crushing.
From Queensland we have received an order from the
Mount Morgan G.M. Co. for a No. 3 crusher for their new
chlorinating works, and which will doubtless lead to
others being ordered. Messrs. Sutton and Co., of Bris-
bane have also ordered a No. 1 crusher for their new
chlorinating process ; it will be used for dry crushing in
Brisbane.
The Kapai-Yermont G.M. Co. of Auckland, N.Z., have
purchased a complete plant consisting of No. 3 crusher,
copper-plate amalgamating tables, framework and steam-
engine and boiler. This plant is ready and is now being
packed for shipment.
The Valgogrin Crushing Co., N.S.W., has purchased a
complete plant, consisting of No. 2 crusher, with engine,
boiler, amalgamating tables, blanket strakes, and other
fittings for use on this field, the various companies having
combined and formed a separate company for the pur-
pose ; this plant is also being packed for shipment.
The Austin Island G.M. Co., Murchison, W.A., has pur-
chased a No. 1 mill with engine, boiler, amalgamating
tables, and blanket strakes complete. This plant has
reached Geraldton, The Otis Co. had this plant erected
complete in their yards with the necessary buildings built
over them before shipment, and despatched the whole
complete, the total weight, including the buildings, being
under 10 tons.
The Francis Reward G.M. Co., Cue, W.A., has also just
received their plant, consisting of a No. 3 mill, with
amalgamating tables and blanket strakes, engine, boiler,
and mill framing complete. The total weight of this
plant was 10J tons, and it will be at work by this time.
It will be noted from the foregoing that our opinion of
this crushing plant is being fully borne out; the orders
coming in from every part of Australia, and the numerous
inquiries for estimates show the favour with which it is
being received by the raining community.
We enclose the following information re compressed
fodder.
Compressed Fodder.— We called attention a short time
since to a new outlet for our surplus agricultural produce
—chaff, oats, maize, &c., by means of which the produce
is compressed into a bulk of only 40 cubic feet to the ton
weight. The advantages of horse-feed in this form are
obvious, the saving in freight and storage space, espe-
cially for inland and oversea carriage, being enor-
mous, independent of its preservative qualities. This
is quite apparent when it is stated that feed
for two horses for a fortnight’s journey can be
conveniently stowed away under the seat of an ordinary
Abbot buggy. The process of compression in no way
injures the food properties of the produce, and nothing
whatever is added to it. The Agricultural Department
here have had an analysis made of the samples, and states
that the nutritive value is equal to that of the uncom-
pressed fodders. Samples have been taken to England
by the Hon. R. Reid, of Victoria, with the result that he
has cabled the Agricultural Department of Victoria to have
100 tons sent to England at once, at the same time stating
that there is an excellent market tor it. Samples were
also taken to India by the Government commercial envoys
with the result that orders have been cabled for ship-
ments, so that there is a great opening for a large export
trade being opened up as soon as the necessary plants are
in working order, and it will be a great relief to our agri-
cultural friends. Wo understand a strong syndicate has
been formed to work these patents in all the Australasian
colonies, and the machinery for the first plant is now
being erected with all speed by the Austral Otis Engineer-
ing Co., who have carried out all the preliminary experi-
ments.

a figure-head so far
as utility is con-

sum in rates and
taxes, and reigns

THREE FORTUNATE WOMEN.
We will introduce you to the oldest one first. Her
name is Mrs. Jessie Russell, and she lives near the
city of New York, in America. She was born in
London in 1787, and is therefore 105 years old.
She remembers many incidents of her childhood,
and still has traces of former beauty. Her eyes
are bright, and become animated when she talks.
She retains her mental faculties completely. She
descends two flights of stairs to every meal, and
returns without assistance. Up to three years
ago she was a regular attendant at the Greenwood
Baptist Church. Her sight is excellent, and she
reads the newspapers every day, and takes great
interest in the news from England. She has
never had any serious illness in her life, and her
appetite and digestion are almost as good as they
were fifty years ago.
The second woman says; “ Ever since I was a
child I have suffered from illness. Thirteen years
ago a tired, languid, and heavy feeling came over
me. The white of my eyes became tinged with
yellow, my skin was sallow, and my hands and
feet were cold and clammy. My mouth tasted
badly, especially in the morning, and I was often
sick, vomiting a sour, frothy fluid. I had a pain
in the chest and sides, heartburn, and flatulency.
For four years I suffered like this, and I shall be
glad to recommend the medicine that finally cured
me.” (Signed) (Mrs.) Frances Emily Smith, 49a,
Wood house Street, Leeds, January 25th, 1892.
The third woman says: “ I have been delicate
all my life. For the past six years I have always
felt tired, languid, and weak. I had a poor
appetite, a bad taste in the mouth, and pain after
every morsel I ate. I was dizzy, and often felt as
if I was going to fall. I always felt sick, and
would retch and strain, but could bring nothing
up. There was a dull pain at my right side and
a dreadful pain between the shoulders. I never
knew what it was to be well. After being on my
feet for a while my legs would swell very much;
No doctor was able to help me, nor any medicine.
that is, up to the time I took the one which gave
me my health back. I never felt so well in my life
as Ido now.” (Signed) (Mrs.) Sarah Sharman,
Clinton, near Market Deeping, February 19th,
1892.
Why do we put these three women in a group—
the one venerable woman in America and the
two others here in England ? They are perfect
strangers to one another and always will be. We
do it to show how long and happily a woman may
live if she only happens to escape the malady
that everywhere threatens her sex; and also to
show that those who have been burdened and
cursed with it may be cured and once more taste
the joys of health.
Mrs. Smith concludes her letter in these words :
“After taking three bottles of Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup all pain and sickness left me, and
I knew no more of the ailment that had troubled
me so long, indigestion and dyspepsia. I know
others who have been benefited by the Syrup. All
sufferers should use it. r'
Mrs. Sharman adds that after she had doctored
and doctored and taken everything, almost with-
out getting any good from it, Mr, Webster, a
grocer of Glinton, said, “ Why don’t you use
Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup ? ” She acted on
his suggestion, and health wasn’t long in coming.
“I cannot speak too highly of Seigel’s Syrup,”
she says. We should agree with her in that
opinion, for a remedy that will in a few weeks put
an end to a case of chronic indigestion and dys-
pepsia is certainly worth a good word or two.
Now here you have these three Englishwomen
—one so fortunate as to have lived more than a
century without an illness ; the others ( still more
fortunate ) have known the sadness of suffering
and the pleasure of recovery.
Oh, my ! oh, my ! how hard it is to tell who is
best off in this queer world.

LIVE FOR EVER!
ì
Was the salute tendered to King Solomon by his people.
Nevertheless Solomon the Wise died at a comparatively
early age, because he did not know how to care for that
most important organ of the human body, the liver, which
has justly been considered the great centre of life’s
machinery. In it is stored the nutriments absorbed
during digestion, which is gradually given out into the
blood to keep up the vigor of the human organism. When
the Liver ceases to do its work the head is heavy, thoughts
come slowly, the tongue is dirty, mouth tastes foul, appetite
is poor; sleep is disturbed, bile circulates in the blood,
causing a yellow tinge in the skin and eruptions, fits of
coughing, slimy expectorations, and pains in the right side.
If this condition is not checked, the consequences will be
serious to the sufferer. The best and never-failing remedy is
Fuss’s
Liver Restorative
Constipation Cure
It is a Certain Remedy for all Disorders of the Liver and Kidneys, Indigestion,

against the over indulgence in food or liquor its eifects are marvellous. A
few doses prevent sea-sickness.
The Unprecedented Success FUSS’S LIVER RESTORATIVE AND

The Man Who Teamed for the New.
(FOR THE BULLETIN)
. ,
There was once a man who yearned tor
the New. He was sick of conventionalities, and
tired to death of paved roads. Ho longed for a
course untrammelled and unexplored. Ho was
absolutely nauseated with the sameness with which
people followed each other up and down through
the world, one after another, treading in each
others footsteps just like so many sheep. If here
and there, there did happen to be one who
branched away from the others and started a new
road for himself it was because he was blind,
They were all blind, but the leaders were the
blindest of all, he said.
He was so disgusted with things that be deter-
mined he would invent an altogether new system
of living, and to this end he drew out on paper,
and with infinite trouble, a plan of action which
had never before been followed by any mortal
man. I his took him several years to arrange, and
just as it appeared to him to be as near perfection
as he could hope to make it, he discovered that
one of his grandest and most original plans had
been adopted by* a man in a novel.
It was a great blow to him. It comp etely upset
his vvorknigs for he took to reading other novels,
and was confronted with the appa ling discovery
that men in novels did everything that men out of
novels did not do. . . ,
You will perceive the desperation of such a
situation. He cast about to make an end of him-
self, saying that there was nothing new under the
sun, but before he could find a way of (lying
that nobody had ever tried before, a very conven-
tioiial thing indeed happened to him. He fell in
love and forgot about the dying. _
night he bad been to see the girl he was
engaged to, but did not love, and did not mean to
m my. She was, of course, not pretty. Nor
was she better than pretty. He had taken
care not to have anyone so hackneyed as that,
But she was intense in a way that no other
woman in the land could approach, and her
eyes were goggle.
She said to him this night, “ Do you guess my
thoughts before I utter them? Do you always
know what I’m thinking of? I do with you. It
is so beautiful.”
He looked uneasy.
“ Let us take hands and sit in silence for ten
minutes/ and at the end of that time we’ll tell each
other what each of us thought of. Begin.” They
to >k hands and were silent. She looked into
space. He began to think what goggle eyes she
h id. Then he tried not to think what goggle eyes
sh ! had, and was confused with the thought that
he was thinking. that he would not think what
goggle eyes she had,
At the end of ten minutes her eyes came back
from space and fastened on his face.
“ You thought of love and death,” she said,
H >r voice thrilled.
He said nothing.
“ Tell me what you thought I thought of,” she
said.
“ Me,” he said modestly.
Sire looked hurt. “Ah, no,” she said, “not
that. I thought,” she sighed, “ I thought of two
fair twin souls meeting after a million years of
parting to kiss in space.”
He didn’t know what to say to that, so shortly
after fie went home. It was as he was going home
that the conventional thing happened to him. He
fell in love. This girl, of course, was very pretty,
and her prettiness was the only intense thing
ab “ Allow me to pass your tickets,” said he.
“ Thank you,” she said. I believe those were
the words she usedj bllt tbe i ook that went with
them, the poise of her head, the dimple at her
mouth, and the sudden curving of her wrist as she
passed them, meant more than words—meant, in
f ac t j something like this : “You’re a young man.
And how pretty I am. Look at me. lam not
going to take any notice of you, though. But be
sure you look at me. Nobody ever had such long
eyelashes as I have. And what pretty boots I
wear. Don’t forget to look at me, and if I appear
to be offended, you’ll know that I’m really
nothing of the kind.”
He interpreted all this rightly, and looked
hard at her> She b to read a book . Then
he looked oufc of the window . She looked
U p and bowed and smiled at an imaginary some-
bod a( . the end of the car . Then she droppe d her
handkerchief, and was very surprised when he
nickod ifc and it fco | le r. So the acquaint-
ance began
Yes, less than a month after that they were
enga?ed but he had not to i d her that he was not
going to marry, and that he was also engaged to
the girl with the goggle eyes. He told though
of hig lan o{ lif e , and 'she listened with great
gravifcy> Sh e was a smart girl, and had her full
s hare of brains
“Very nice,” she said. “Um ! Very nice.”
g be nodded her head,
Encouraged by her nod, he thought it would
p erbaps be a s well to let her know that marriage
was one () f the conve ntional things he had ean-
celled from his calendar. He was a little nervous
0 f beginning the subject, and his nervousness in-
creased when he saw tiny sparks flash up in the
softness of her dark eyes.
“You see,” he ended up, “they all marry, in
the novels and out, so I couldn’t possibly do it.”
She looked towards the door, and somehow—
this was always a vague phrase to him—he found
himself out in the street, unconventional at the
cost of the prettiest girl he had ever dreamt of.
# # #
For two days he was very miserable. But
he still had hope, in its commonest form—the
postman. However, she did not write, and on
the third day he learnt accidentally that she was
on the verge of becoming engaged to another
man. She was, in fact, about to adopt the best
means of self-consolation that mortals possess,
the consoling of someone else. She only waited
for the someone else to ask her. Everybody in
her street knew she was going to say “Yes.”
For two hours the young man who yearned for
the New walked up and down past her house. In
that time all the hopes of his life-time changed to
vanity. (She certainly was very vain.) Nothing
remained desirable but the girl he had lost. He
cast aside all Ids yearnings, and, marching heroic-
ally, knocked at the front door with the speech all
ready on his lips. “I come to yield. Marriage
is the most beautiful bond in life. There could
be nothing conventional in it. Other people
have married, but not such people as you and I;
you so charming and beautiful, and I so—”
There he was going to pause and sigh just long
enough for her to burst into tears, and be recon-
ciled.
What really did happen was much shorter. He
knocked at the door, and she, opening it herself,
said “I’m out,” and slammed it again in his face.
As he walked away he bought a penny paper,
in the hopes of finding some novel suggestion for a
suicide. Glancing through it, he saw a short
story, headed “ The Idiot Who was Afraid to Die,”
When he had read it he trembled.
It was the story of his own life. It betrayed,
with a cruel fidelity of detail, all the secrets of his
plan of life ; it jeered at him ; it held him up, and
begged everybody to laugh at him, tossing and
kicking against fate. It said he was always
bragging about killing himself, but never found
the time. It told the incident of his engagement
to the girl he had loved, and its subsequent end.
And its moral was that men should be warned,
and go and do otherwise.
And it was signed with the name of the girl he
loued !
He went away toward a river. He was aware
dimly that this was not altogether a new thing to
do, but he was too depressed to mind. Only once
an instinct of his old yearning cams over him.
It was just before he plunged.
“In novels,” he said, “the hero always takes
off his coat, and flings it aside. I’ll keep mine
on.”
Then he plunged, and went to find a world
where there were no novels, where men were not
sheep, where the yearning for the new was forever
satisfied. He went, in fact, to the New Jeru-
salem, which was not wholly a new thing to do,
if he had only reflected on it.
The girl declared she would almost have loved
him if he had only been a sheep.

BAXTER’S LOAN.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It was one of those raw, blustering nights when
a man, comfortably housed, says, “ I pity those
poor devils sleeping in the park to-night,” and
pats himself on the back for his charitable feeling.
One of the “poor devils” sitting on a wet seat
in the park thought with regret of his recent past,
when he was going through his money in the
orthodox fashion. He thrust his hand into his
sodden pocket as a matter of habit, for he well
knew there was not a single coin there, then
rose, shook himself, and commenced to walk along
the asphalt path for the sake of warmth. If he
had not been so very shabby he would have
sought out some of his old haunts on the chance
of meeting an acquaintance not too proud to say,
Hello, Hardwick 1” and good for a drink, at
any rate.
The Post-office clock boomed midnight, when
he saw some one coming towards him under the
dripping trees. Hardwick had not tried begging
yet, but he determined, if the new-comer looked
well-off, to appeal to his charity. The new-comer
was a red-faced, middle-aged gentleman. He
wore a white hat, somewhat on one side, an over-
coat unbuttoned, and carried a closed umbrella.
He was chuckling and talking to himself, and
ooked very happy. To a professional dead-beat
ho would have been a merciful dispensation of
Providence, with a capital P. Hardwick ap-
proached him, and the two met and halted.
“ Hello, Charley !” said the man with the white
hat, “you out at this time? For shame!” and he
made a playful dig with his umbrella. Astonished
at this reception Hardwick commenced to stammer
a humble request for a small donation, when the
other interrupted him. “Fact is, Charley, I’m
awfully glad to meet you. Got a bit sprung, you
know, and feel like sitting down for a sleep, but
then some of those d d unemployed will go
through me. _ Now, look here, Charley ” —here he
took Hardwick’s arm—“you’re a steady young
file, just take care of these notes for me ” —ho
thrust a bundle into Hardwick’s hand—“and I’ll
sit down and have forty winks. Don’t like going
home screwed, you know.”
Hardly knowing what to do, Hardwick led the
intoxicated man to a retired seat.
“He’ll surely give me something for looking
after him,” he thought. “ Might as well know who
he is, though. What’s your address now?” he
asked.
‘ 1 Oh ! same old ticket—Tom'<Baxter, care of
Renwick and Rehwick,” and Mr. Baxter, with his
hat still more on one side, fell fast asleep as soon
as he sat down. Hardwick glanced up and down
the wet, glistening pathway, then he went to the
nearest lamp and examined the notes. In fives
and ones there was nearly .£5O. He put them in
his pocket and started doing sentry-go in front of
the sleeping man. Baxter had evidently mistaken
him for someone he knew—misled, in his stupid
condition, by a chance resemblance.
Hardwick had .£5O in his pocket, and ten
minutes before he had not a shilling. Needless to
enter into the mental conflict that ensued. When
the clock struck one he had decided to take a loan,
only a loan, of the .£5O. Baxter was evidently a
well-to-do man who could afford to “lend” the
money. Hardwick withdrew into the shadows
and watched the man on the seat. He had, doubt-
less, more money in his pocket and a gold watch
and chain. Hardwick would not leave him a prey
to the first prowler who might come along. He
had so much conscience.
In the course of another hour Baxter awoke,
sobered. He got up, felt in all his pockets, seemed
disappointed, then stood musing. Suddenly ho
appeared to remember something, for ho straight-
ened his hat, buttoned his coat, put his umbrella
up, and marched firmly away. Baxter had just
remembered that before sitting down he met
Charley Stimson, the son of his old friend, and
gave him the roll of notes to take care of. That
was all right.
Hardwick, taught a lesson by the past, made
good use of the loan, as he persisted in regarding 1
it. He avoided all his former acquaintances and
departed for Coolgardie by the first steamer.
Luck followed him ; he did well; he did better ;
at last he struck it rich.” He never forgot
Laxter. Half-a-dozen times he was on the point
of forwarding .£5O to the address which he had
written down, but something always interfered to
stop nun. His favourite dream was that he might
und Laxter in low circumstances and astonish
him by repaying the loan a hundred-fold. Before
six months had passed Hardwick was a fairly
rich man, with a large share in a good reef.
Now, Baxter was not by any means wealthy.
He was on the verge of insolvency. He might
have pulled through by the grace of old Stimson
his principal creditor, but when he said that he
met Charley Stimson (a very good young man) in
Hyde I ark, at 12 o’clock at night, and entrusted
him with .£5O, Stimson raged. Then Baxter got
obstinate, and swore that Charley must have
stuck to the money. There was a law-case and,
finally, rum for Baxter, who went down till he
could n t get any lower.
It was again a rainy night, when Hardwick,
just back from Westralia, was returning home
across the park. The pathway was deserted
as before ; the wet pools glistened in the gaslight.
A figure rose from the very seat where he once
sat. A figure in an old, white hat and shabby
greatcoat, holding a battered umbrella. The
wreck of Baxter!
Hardwick s heart stood still as the phantom
halted ami accosted him. Now was his oppor-
tunity. Take this waif home to his hotel and give
him of the best. That was the first generous
thought. Then came those cold, calculating
second thoughts. l< Don’t be in a hurry • give
him something to-night, and do the rest when
you re calm to-morrow, ”
Hardwick had a sovereign and a shilling in his
pocket. Ho would give Baxter—who plainly did
not remember him—the sovereign, and find out
his address next morning. He thrust the coin in
the man s hand and went on. Arrived at the
hotel he went to the bar before going upstairs ; he
pulled out the remaining coin to pay for his drink
! He had given Baxter the shilling.
Never mind, I will make it up to-morrow,” he
thought as he dropped off to sleep.
Next morning, in a virtuous frame of mind
Hardwick hunted up Baxter’s address. Poor
Baxter had no address, but lie still called occasion-
ally at his old firm’s offices in the hope of some-
thing turning up. Hardwick smiled as lie thoucrht
of what would turn up next time Baxter called.
He went home and sat down with his pleasant
anticipation. He could write a cheque for four
figures, if he liked, but that would be too much
all at once. Baxter had evidently gone to the
dogs; he must be reclaimed gradually—say ,£2O
for a start. He would send it to-morrow; mean-
time, Baxter would be all right—he had the
sovereign to go on with.
In the middle of the night Hardwick woke,
and one of those unpleasant thoughts which always
nit a fellow at that time reminded him that it
was a shilling he had given Baxter, not the
sovereign he intended.
, At tiie same time, down in hell, the devil re-
minded the paving-commissioners that many
streets needed repairing. Next day was Sunday,
so Hardwick could do nothing.
On Monday, however, he took his cheque-book,
and seriously considered the subject. He deter-
mined to consult lien wick and Renwick, telling
them some plausible tale to account for his
interest m Baxter. Putting his cheque-book in
h-Pocket, no picked up the morning paper,
I ho first thing he saw was a paragraph stating
that the_ dead body of a man had been found
boating m Woolloomooloo Bay, and that the
deceased had been identified as Thomas Baxter,
once well-known in city circles.
X suppose, muttered Hardwick, after staring
very hard at the wall, “he would only have spent
lfc i!l drink. _ Perhaps it’s all for the best.”
I hen, as it was a fine morning, he went for a
stroll m the park.

Would God but still the clangour of the sky
And vyheels of destiny that harshly roll,
Crushing the golden glory of the soul
From out the dross of dull mortality.
Then, every doubting heart and straining eye
Might see and understand the perfect whole,
The earth, the stars, and spiritual goal,
Obedient to the Master standing by.
But while we blindly drive from dust to dust,
Confounded in the chaos of an hour,
With death and hell tumultuous everywhere.
We cannot hide our hearts in trembling trust,
Or differ from the dying daisy flower,
Save in this weary wisdom of despair.

In the Basin Reserve.
(A Love Story.)
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
They sat on a seat placed beneath the shadow of
the trees in the Basin Reserve.
Just a flower that wanted culling—just a
creature born to be loved—just a being of the most
exquisite sensibility (with apologies to the memory
of Mahomet) —just the ideal creation (or creative)
of the amorous fancy—the prolonger of life—the
sharer of joys—in fact, a woman, not a piano—all
that she was.
They sat, and sat, and sat on.
And as they sat, a great strange wonder (with
apologies to Rider Haggard)grew upon them, i.e.,
thrust itself palpably before them.
The rain had left a little pool at her feet, and a
spider had fallen into the water. The man leaned
forward and quietly extricated it, thereby saving
its life.
Ah ! she thought, the man who will save the
life of a spider will not be cruel to a woman, brute
though he appears.
Two souls that stroked as one.
She died of a kick administered by a boot on
her husband’s leg.
Against her judgment, not deceived, etc. (with
apologies to Milton), but foully overcome by hob-
nails.
His goal was the gaol (with apologies to the
Australian football clubs).

Harvard College, one centre of the Free-
trade cult in the U.S., has been struck heavily by
the awful depression which followed the advent
of the Democratic party, and a whole gang of
professors have been retrenched. Says the
Argonaut:
-TUi s is tiie chain that leads up to the college professor:
the Democratic threats of Freetrade tariff-tinkering scared
the importers, and they stopped importing ; it scared the
merchants, and they stopped buying ; this left the manu-
facturers without orders, and they shut down the factories
and the mills; this left the mill-hands without any money
and they stopped buying things from the shop-keepers •
the shop-keepers stopped buying things from (he mer-
chants; the railroads had nothing to haul from mill to
merchant, from merchant to shop-keeper; the railroads
began losing money, although they discharged men, cut
wages, and laid off trains ; they failed to earn their fixed
charges and operating expenses ; they failed to pay the
interest on their bonds; Harvard College has money
invested in railroad bonds ; the railroads are in the hands
of receivers, and cannot pay interest; Harvard gets no
interest on her investments ; her revenues are reduced •
she is forced to discharge the professors who taught the
free trade that shut the shops that stopped the mills that
destroyed the freight traffic that ruined the railroads that
cut off the interest that paid the professors their salaries.

of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating whatsizeyou generally lake,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet

little matters attended to, if you have a long thin foot, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS’S,

Gen. Teesdale, formerly equerry to the

Stead’s so-called cure for drunkenness is
the old, old “vinegar of quassia,” known to our
great-great-great-grandfathers, who, however,
didn’t want to be cured of drunkenness. But
‘‘ vinegar of quassia ” won’t cure chronic, or even
intermittent, dipsomania. It is a mild reliever of
fevers malarial; and many will remember the
wooden cups, like wineglasses, carved out in quassia
wood ; you filled them with water and let them
stand a minute. The medicinal virtues of quassia
being soluble in cold water, presently you get an
infusion of quassia—supposed to be prophylactic
against malarial attacks. Stead must either have
unchainable impudence or unfathomable ignorance
to attempt to palm off “ vinegar of quassia ” as a
new cure for alcoholism.
Discussing the chance of hereditary strength
versus hereditary brains, London Referee says :
After a hard battle for life the Shakespeare blood sur-
vived on the female side, and has been traced through
nine generations—l allude to the Hart branch of the
family, the last known member of which was George Hart,
of Birmingham, a plumber, who emigrated to Australia
about 30 years ago. Has there been a second genius in
that long line ? Not at all. The Harts have been a race
of utter mediocrities, plying the humblest callings and for
the most part miserably poor. Yet longevity in the Hart
family occurs over and over again.
The Bulletin will maintain that the Hart who
came to Australia must have been a genius, for
every plumber is a genius in his way. And if
this same George Hart started plumbing over here
he ought to be anything but poor by this time.
No plumber can remain miserably poor after
getting his first job, if he follows the plan of hang-
ing on to each job until he gets another.
From Bathurst (N.S.W.) Advocate, which

To call such a fellow as this a man is an insult to the
species. To describe such a fellow as he, who would do
as he did—smear the exterior house fixings of an enemy,
real or imaginary, with the contents of a cesspit, as brute,
as beast, as a thing wiih the mind of a chimpanzee and
the foul instincts of a buzzard, would be to offer to each
of those creatures an unmerited insult, for God made
them so. Patrick Rooney is a grown human being, not a
monkey. Patrick Rooney is a fellow man, not a buzzard.
Patrick Rooney is of the species which the clergy tell us
is made in the image of the Creator. Yet Patrick Rooney
is meaner than the lowest of the creatures we have
named. Never preach the abolition of the cat-o’-nine-
tails to the Advocate.

A Bush Wedding.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“He cometh not,” she said.
She was the bride. Thirty years of hard work
had not made her look younger ; but her brideship
clothed her with a certain indefinable attraction,
and—who ever dared call a bride ugly ?
She stood at the window, her rather snub nose
pressed against the glass, her eyes striving to
pierce the veil of rain and mist that obscured the
track leading along the side of the range down
which the laggard groom would have to come.
The view was cheerless. Paddocks overgrown
with bracken stretched as far as the eye could
reach, until they met the wall of scrub; a wet,
miserable cow endeavoured to shelter her scraggy
frame on the lee-side of the trunk of a dead gum,
whose sap, churned by the rain, lay in frothy
heaps about the roots. The dripping tree-ferns in
the gully seemed like funeral plumes, and over the
gully the smoke-like mist floated in heavy clouds,
while through the rain, near and far, showed the
everlasting gums.
; The bride turned from the window with a
Oliver, and crawled back into her bed. It had
tfeen raining for a week and she was anxious, for
well she knew that thirty miles of rough bush-
track and side-cutting, with many flooded creeks,
lay between the selection and the township whence
the clergyman had to be brought.
It was now two hours after the time fixed for the
ceremony. Soon after dawn her mother and
sisters had arrayed her in her bridal attire; and
as they did not think it would be proper for the
guests to see her until just before the wedding,
she had been shut up in her bedroom ever since.
There was no fire-place in the room, and the cold
was so intense that she had passed the greater
part of the time sitting on her bed —her wreath
prevented her lying down. Twenty times
she had rushed to the window at the sound of
wheels, expecting to see the missing groom, but
only to see more sodden guests disgorged from
many-shaped vehicles. As the morning waxed
into afternoon she became hysterical (her imagina-
tion pictured her beloved struggling for his life in
the muddy flood), and it was necessary to
administer brandy and water at short intervals.
At last her straining eyes were rewarded, for as
the rain cleared off for a moment, she discerned a
something—a small object between two larger
ones, followed by another small object far up on
the cutting. That first small object her beating
heart told her was the missing bridegroom ; then
the rain hid him from her sight. Through the
slush he came—a moving lump of mud leading the
two buggy horses, while behind followed another
animated mud-lump, who, with an umbrella,
endeavoured to shelter what had once been a
white paper parcel. They had left the buggy
bogged ten miles away, and had done the
remainder of the journey on foot.
They were supplied with fresh clothes; the
surplice was dried, and at four o’clock the wed-
ding-ceremony took place in the large barn, which
had been festooned with ferns and adorned with
Chinese lanterns and banners. The banners bore
in parti-coloured paper-letters the wish, “ May
God bless their union !” and other appropriate
aspirations. The bride was not nervous, but the
bridegroom was, and in the act of placing the ring
upon her finger he let it fall. There w»-re only two
or three cracks in the barn floor, but the ring dis-
appeared down one of them, and the marriage was
delayed while the youngest brother of the bride
crawled under the barn to recover it.
This being accomplished, the ceremony was
finished satisfactorily. The sister and mother
of the bridegroom were weeping copiously, but
the bride’s relatives seemed rather pleased than
otherwise. One of her brothers confided to a
guest in an audible whisper that “if Billy knew
what a temper she’s got he wouldn’t have been in
such a hurry to git her !” Billy evidently had no
idea of what the future held in store for him, for
a few minutes later helooked perfectly happy seated
at the head of the table with his bride, who had
developed a keen appetite which, with the assist-
ance of half a chicken and some tongue, she was
endeavouring to allay. During the breakfast a
parcel was handed to the bride. It was opened
and found to contain a pair of tiny woollen shoes.
The bride, who had passed the bashful age, handed
them to the bridegroom, who pocketed them with
the remark that he “ hoped they would come in
handy.”
At half-past seven the barn was cleared for
dancing. The band consisted of an aocordeon and
violin. What can the “upper sucoles,” who
change their waltz-step as they change their dress
fashions, know of the beauty of the waltz? No
sooner do they become accustomed to one step
than it is changed for another. Here some of the
men wore medals as a sign of their prowess in the
art terpsichorean. Champion waltzers were they,
dancing the same steps as their fathers did before
them. No rapid moving up and down, in and
out, and reversing, to the imminent danger of
their neighbours. Their evident object was to
gyrate on as small a surface as possible, and keep
an exact distance between themselves and the
couple directlyin front.
, At ten, supper was announced, and afterwards
dancing was renewed with fresh vigour. The rain
still fell steadily, and from across the ranges occa-
sionally came the sullen roar of some giant gum
tearing its roots from the wet earth and crashing
headlong. The bridegroom is dancing merrily;
but the bride is missing. She is found sitting
before a fire, nursing someone’s baby while the
mother dances. She looks aged and weary; her
hair is out of curl, three or four little straight
black wisps hang on each side of her face ; her
wreath is awry—all the orange-blossoms have
fallen off ; there is a little droop at the corner of
her mouth, and there are lines under her eyes.
The unceasing rain is depressing. It is impos-
sible for any of the guests to leave before daylight,
so the bride retires to the nuptial chamber,
accompanied by someone’s baby and the mother
or three other female friends who are to
share her bed. The happy bridegroom makes him-
self as comfortable as he can under the circum-
stances with three chairs, a blue blanket, and his
pipe. He is lulled to sleep by the sound of the
rain beating steadily on the shingles overhead,
instead of by the cooing of his new-made bride.
THE PAUPER.
The Waiter's Lament.—A Boom-Bust
Lay.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I remember, I remember, not many years ago,
When everything was booming and tire champagne
used to flow,
How customers came flocking in and couldn’t find
a seat,
And ordered goose and apple-sauce and wouldn’t
look at meat,
They’d tumble up at half-past twelve and keep it
up till three ;
The waiters was a-buzzin round as busy as could
be—
Roast duck fur one, green peas fur two, and soups
three, a la Reine ;
And, waiter, don't forget to bring a bottle of
champagne,
And put it in a silver jug, and mind you make it
nice—
Four glasses, please, a lemon squeeze, and don’t
forget the ice. ■
Here, waiter, wots’ the best you’ve got upon the
bill of fare ?
Trot us in just wot you like, we’ll leave it in your
care;
A bottle of the finest wine that you can ferret out,
And, waiter, bring the bill to me, to-day I’m
going to shout.
And now the fun is at its height, the waiters shout
and bawl,
The cooks with carving-knife and fork upon the
poultry fall,
While the boss he is a-swearin enough to make
him bust,
And the coat-tails of the waiters, why you can’t
see ’em for dust,
Then the clitter and the clatter that the plates and
dishes make,
And the yellin’ of the mean ones fur their
bloomin’ chops or steak,
Which we don’t take no heed, in course, but let
them yell like mad
Till the people settin’ opposite thinks they’ve
been taken bad.
Those were the bloomin’, boomin’ days when the
bosses used to smile.
And the waiters after luncheon was a-countin’ of
their pile ;
When the pockets of their trousers, afore they
went to bed,
Was a-hangin’ down their bloomin’ legs, just like
two lumps of lead ;
But, Lor’, since then how things have changed in
this hero marv’llous town ;
It’s hard to get a tanner now, let alone a ’arf a
crown,
And if they gives you sixpence for a brushin’ of
their hat
They stays away a month or two and whips the
bloomin’ oat;
And where are now the jolly dogs that used to
roll up stairs
And talk about the land they’d sold, and how the
tramway shares
Had doubled since the morning, which at that
time wasn’t strange,
Then order in a bottle, and say “ Waiter, keep k, » e
change !”
Well, some are on their uppers now, and some are
up the spout
A-doin’ ten and fifteen years afore they will g< t
out,
And some have blown their brains out, arid some
have drowned their woes
In the bottom of the Yarra where the dirty water
flows,
And some have gone to Heaven, and some have
gone to—well,
The Argentine Republic, which is one remove
from hell;
At least that’s what they tells me, I ain’t been
there myself,
And if things go on as they are now, I'll soon be
on the shelf,
For what with cuttin’ down yer screw and tips so
hard to make,
And right down bloomin’ meanness, why, Mel-
bourne takes the cake.

Spagnoletti: Last Saturday night a lady,
with her hat off, was ably addressing a large
crowd of men in South Melb. Market, by torch-
light, on Henry George.
A Pahiatua (M.L.) man writes to the local
paper complaining that he is annoyed by an
anonymous correspondent who keeps sending him

yards Depot, 285 Oollins-street.
Had he been born a day later he would have had

The eternal question concerning the Aus-
tralian accent, and how it originated, and how it
is to be cured, and whether there is any Australian
accent at all, has branched out into many new
directions. The Australian grammar is now the
subject principally in dispute. The latest writer
—who calls himself “Australian Native”—com-
plains :
For instance, “deceased left a wife” has occurred
frequently in the columns of the leading daily, when it
should have been—deceased left or leaves a widow. Why,
even in the State School First Reader, the children read,
“ A widow is a woman whose husband is dead.’’
This is getting things down tolerably fine. For,
as it happens, deceased doesn’t leave a widow.
A woman is not a widow until she is left by her
husband, and the husband can’t leave what he has
left already. And it is also questionable if he
leaves a wife, for she ceases to be a wife the
instant he leaves her. The truly grammatical
inwardness of the situation seems to be that he
leaves Mrs. Smith and her family. This is the
only relationship which is permanent; providing
the deceased’s name was Smith the lady was Mrs.
Smith before his death, and she continues so after-
wards. Grammar is an interesting subject when
you get fairly into it.
We desire to mention, for the benefit of
readers of The Bulletin, that Hordern Brothers,
the well-known drapers of 203 Pitt-st., are sending
(post free) anything you order to any part of
N S.W.. Victoria or Queensland ; it would be as
well, when you write, to mention to them that
you heard of it first through this paper. This
firm has been known for years as reliable and
doing a steady business, but of late they have
struck out in an extraordinarily vigorous style,
sending parcels everywhere free, &0., &o.*

will be found the strange romances which write
themselves, often in letters of blood, amid the
half-unknown mysterious regions of tropical Aus-

I take it upon myself to affirm.

author who L familiar with life in Northern Queensland, writes with vigour about the doings of the whites and the natives in these faraway

“No writer has given the world a more vivid description of Australia and its wilderness than Ernest Favenc, and the secret of this is that
he has hvmanvyears’ experience of travel and bush life, acquired a knowledge of this continent which is possessed by scarcely any other writer

his best’ work. That "they will be widely read is certain,”— Sydney Mail, July 8,18. W.
“ Thev present with force and vividness, as well as with the accuracy arising from long contact and keen observation, striking pictures of
