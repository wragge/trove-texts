HIS
BOOKS
“Wealthy Lower Orders”
The case against plutocracy in the
U.S.A. has often been stated, but for
the most part the critics have been home-
staying Americans like Mencken, or
enemies of capitalism like Upton Sin-
clair, or movie directors on the lookout
for exciting situations. Here are two
books of short stories most of which
are about rich Americans of the period
immediately preceding the national-re-
covery campaign. One is by a well-
known Australian who has lived for long
periods at a stretch in America and in
Continental cities, such as Paris, which
were full of Americans until recently;
the other is by Edna Ferber. Hers is
vastly superior on the technical side, of
course, but the two writers have many
points in common ; a cosmopolitan out-
look, knowledge, and that easy freedom
from bigotries, social, religious and poli-
tical, which is to be found in all intelli-
gent folk who have knocked about the
world. Wanderers of the sort are trained
to be objective by the way they live ;
they and the Prince of Wales are about
the only true internationals that the war
has left us.
Studies in Boredom
All the stories in Edna Ferber’s They
Brought Their Women (Heinemann ; 7s.
6d.) have morals of a sort, but the only
one with an old-fashioned, or O. Henry,
ending is “Fraulein.” Here we have a
sermon which has been preached at the
idle rich thousands of times but which
never loses its point or savor.
Mrs. Carlton Schurtz had everything. In the
order of their (to her) importance, she had
money, position, looks, children, health and
love—of a sort.
From this text the sermoniser proceeds
to show that Mrs. Schurtz has, in fact,
nothing. She is bored with her elderly
husband and his friends. She has the
creamy beauty of a magnolia and a lan-
guorous manner, but anaemia is largely
responsible. One day in every week is
agony to her. Fraulein’s day out.
On that grim day, from 2 p.m. till mid-
night, Mrs. Schurtz, assisted only by an
inexpert parlormaid, has to look after
her two children. “I follow Fraulein’s
routine exactly,” she wails to her hus-
band. “I do every single thing that she
does —food, nap, park, bath, everything.
And they behave like fiends.”
The Schurtzes are sorry for Fraulein
Berta. What a life for a girl of 23! No
money, no friends, no interests. They
wonder what she does on her day off.
Takes a ’busman’s holiday, they con-
clude, sitting with some friend who also
has to look after somebody else’s child-
ren. Then comes the revelation of what
Berta does ; the visit to her lover, their
ecstatic meeting, their parting, hours that
are lyric with youth, joy and hope.
The nursery is in an uproar when
Berta gets back and Mrs. Schurtz is in
despair. The little boy seems to be ill.
Fraulein takes charge. The howling
stops. “Go to bed, madame,” she says
to her mistress.
The child’s arm reached up, the hand rested
on Fraulein’s cheek; she turned her head and
kissed the -soft warm palm. Deep quivering
sighs shook him. Suddenly, miraculously, in
that instant he was asleep. Fraulein made
motions with her lips, with her free hand, with
her head. They spelled Go, Go.
Mrs. Carlton Schurtz went back to bed.
“Wall Street—’2B” is harder, less illu-
sioned. It begins nowhere, ends nowhere.
Cass Condon and his wife also have
everything and nothing. They, too, are
sick of each other and of their friends.
There are no contrasting sentimentali-
ties ; the picture is drab all through. Cass
lives fretfully in a luxury world of per-
fumed airs, soft footsteps, deferential
voices ; an intolerable prison from which
he escapes with relief each morning at
nine o’clock.
Edna Ferber is one of America’s great
short-story writers. Not that she is always
an artist. She isn’t; like every prolific
story-teller, she “writes as the tiger
springs.” She is great because she has
a wealth of ex-
perience to draw
upon, and be-
cause of her
humanity and in-
sight ; she has
known and sym-
pathised with nearly all her characters.
Of the Labor movement towards the end
of the nineteenth century: —
Those were the days when the labor leader
belonged to the class which he led, when the
growing intricacy of trade union organisation
had not yet evolved the secretarial caste which
now lives on labor as royally as it leads it.
Of a childless couple: —
They belonged to almost everything worth
belonging to in Los Angeles, and did not seem
to miss the most fascinating of all belongings.
The book teems with economically-
worded asides of the sort, as effective in
their contexts as the carefully-prepared
impromptus of a good speaker. The
weakest stories are those with Australian
settings or characters. Mr. Kelly has a
fault which is often found in small com-
munities —a tendency to let patriotism
get the better of truth. He isn’t strong
on characterisation, but as a critic of
manners he is equal to the best of them
when he lets himself go ; and he has a
sense of humor.
The most amusing, cynical and com-
pact of his yarns is probably “Ackland
Lends a Hand.” It is a gem of its
wicked sort. Poor Ackland, an estimable
plutocrat, promises when he next visits
Paris to persuade the wife of his pearl-
buying friend Hyslop to rejoin her lonely
husband in the desolate Paumotus.
Arrived in Paris, he is shocked to find
that Nancy Hyslop is having an affair
with a Jew. Actuated by a loyal desire
to do the right thing by the fine fellow
in the Paumotus, Ackland exposes the
Israelite for what he is—a mean liar
with a beautiful wife. Over the Ayala
at the Ritz, where the exposure has taken
place, and later—again over the Ayala
—at Monseigneur, he points out the folly
of wasting tears over the despicable
Hebrew, extols the virtues of the pearl-
sheller. In the taxi afterwards he makes
a proposal which is worthy of his gener-
ous heart. He will do his good deed,
give her an opportunity to build her life
anew, by paying her passage to the
Paumotus.
Overwhelmed with emotion she drew his face
to hers and kissed him lingeringly.
“Oh dear! Oh dear!” said Mr. Ayala Ack-
land. “If you do things like that it is going
to be very hard for me to do my good deed!”
“I do not know that I want you to,” said
Mrs. Ayala Hyslop.
The story which gives the book its
title covers 80-odd pages, and takes the
reader from the heroine’s home town in
the U.S.A. to Eastbourne and London,
on to Cairo by way of Naples and back
to London via Genoa, Venice and Milan.
Ackland is again the victim of a woman’s
wiles. ■ He pays for Winifred’s wander-
ings, and takes a West End flat for her.
In this way the American girl learns
about men and life, and qualifies to be-
come the bride of the president of the
New Chexico Oil Corporation. The
people are stereotyped, but they make a
vast number of bright remarks.
Red Page.
Mostly About Expatriates
W. H. Kelly, author of Winifred
Wakes Up (Angus and Robertson; 6s.),
is an extremely careful writer and a
phrase-maker. He remarks of Tahiti: —
The place was beautiful, but, after all, beauty
that never opens its mouth is apt to become a
bore.
Censorship Standards
The news that Norman Lindsay’s latest
novel has been banned for pornography
must baffle those with knowledge of the
authors who are constantly getting past
our censors.
Consider the latest work of John
Cowper Powys, A Glastonbury Romance
(The Bodley Head ; Dymock’s ; 10s. 6d.).
It is virtually 1100 pages of pornography.
English villagers are portrayed who give
strong support to a theory of the late
Frank Harris that 90 p.c. of human
beings think of nothing but sex.
The chances are that for pure unmitigated
lechery John Crow ranked highest among the
whole population of Glastonbury. Others might
have far more powerful erotic sensations, but

You hear many tyre
statements disputed, hut
it is never denied that
more people , the world
over, ride on Goodyear
Tyres than on any other tyre.
Goodyear Tyres stand first in
popularity and first in sales
because experienced tyre-users
find them first in satisfaction
and first in safety.
Remember, brakes may stop your
wheels, but only tyres can stop
your car — and those tyres must
have centre traction! Look at the
blocks in the centre of the famed
All-Weather Tread —right where
they belong for hold-fast, quick-
sharp-edged, deep-biting, sturdy
stopping grip . . . only Goodyear
Tyres have the All-Weather Tread.

for pure delight derived from lust John would,
with one exception, have carried away the palm.
This exception was Angela Beere, the chaste-
looking, unapproachable daughter of old
Lawyer Beere.
The Glastonburyites conduct their in-
numerable promiscuities by night and
day in every conceivable locality. The
genius of Mr. Powys is such (J. D. Beres-
ford classes this as “one of the greatest
novels in the world”) that he contrives
to envelop his characters’ undignified
scufflings in a glamorous atmosphere of
romanticism. He even beautifies a sordid
encounter in the Wookey Hole, a West
Country answer to our Caves which is
quite as unimpressive as its name. He
actually leaves an aura of sorts on the
Jovian brow of a bewhiskered husband
who is caught in bed by his wife with
their servant. He describes each seduc-
tion in detail; almost everything in
nature has an erotic symbolism for him
and his ; and he takes a perverse delight
in the unlovely words which morons
write furtively on walls. The complete
literary sensualist.
One of the differences between English
writers of this school and Norman Lind-
say is that Lindsay sees the comic side
of passion. He applies the catharsis of
derision to passing infatuations, and they
become banal. Humorless, lusciously
imaginative novels like “A Glastonbury
Romance” idealise chance unions ; Lind-
say’s novels degrade them. At heart this
bane of organised morality in Australia
is a kind of laughing moralist —one who
is just as much a preacher as his mis-
sionary ancestors. Even our censors are
not so dull as to be blind to this truth, .
so it is to be presumed that they are
banning his books on other grounds.
The real objection probably is that
they are about Australians. We still have
the complacent small-town conviction
that we are not as other people. When
the inhabitants of an English village are
depicted as steeped in every kind of vice
wc accept it as natural, and the English
don’t worry; but when some young
people in “Redheap” are shown behav-
ing as their kind do all over the world
a scandalised howl goes up that such
things don’t happen in Australia, and our
censors react to it. Immaturity is en-
gaging, but when a community which
has been settled for a century and a half
persists in clinging to the ways of child-
hood it is in danger of becoming a
laughing-stock.
J. D.
Litany of Lost Innocence
O God, the Father of literature: have
mercy upon us miserable sinners!
From all sedition, privy conspiracy
and rebellion ; from all false doctrine,
artistic heresy and schism ; from hard-
ness of heart and obtuseness of under-
standing and contempt of truth,
Good Lord, deliver us.
Time was when writing man and writ-
ing woman walked in the Garden of
Eden without clothes and without shame,
and they were happy, and without artis-
tic sin or turpitude. They partook freely
of all the fruits of the garden, except
those of the Tree of Knowledge, of
whose existence they were blissfully
ignorant,
But, 10, a Serpent came into the Gar-
den and did whisper into the ear of one
of them, probably the Woman, and, dis-
obeying the command of God, the pair
did eat and the Damage was Done.
From the consequences of their action,
Good Lord, deliver us.
For the name of the Tree was Freud-
Marx, and when man ate thereof he
became captivated by the allurements of
tabloid learning, the lusts of the flesh of
popular science, the charms of the dic-
tionary and the temptations of the Easy
Way Out, so he lost and forfeited the
happiness and prosperity he had enjoyed
in his innocence. To this pristine condi-
tion,
Good Lord, restore us.
For our state of sin is deplorable, and
its evidences are everywhere. Consider
the works of Chekhov, the last writing
man who walked in the Garden uncon-
taminated, how fresh they are!
They mirror men’s minds as a rock-
pool mirrors the sky and the clouds, they
run as pure as the waters of a brook,
they are as cool as the dawn breeze, as
natural as the lark’s song, their rhythm
is as large and free as the swing of the
ocean billow. And there is all truth in
them.
Consider now the works of such fallen
angels as D. H. Lawrence, T. S. Eliot,
James Joyce and others.
They reek of the lamp, they are musty
with the smell of overstocked libraries,
their feet are clogged with the mire
of lexicography.
Consider, O Lord, the fallen writer,
how he works. He getteth up in the bright
spring morning and seeth it not. He
looketh on his wife and his children and
his handmaiden and his ox and perceiveth
them not. Then goeth he down to his den
and readeth a chapter on complexes in
a book on Popular Psychology written
by an eremite of the order known as
Professors who dwell perpetually in Uni-
versity cells, having taken a vow never
to re-enter the world or allow their
thoughts to wander therein.
He taketh a piece of paper and in-
scribeth thereon his Proposed Cast of
Characters, in this wise:
Oedipus complex: Mr. Smith.
Delusions of grandeur: Miss Jones.
Will to power: Grandma Jemima.
Inferiority complex: Uncle John.
Then maketh he out a list of the more
attractive neuroses and distributeth them
equitably amongst his subordinate char-
acters. Then setteth he to work. From
such methods,
Good Lord, deliver us.
Or perhaps he alloweth his eye to rove
casually over the dictionary until it
falleth on
“Siderodromophobia: fear of railway
journeys.”
Whereupon he taketh up his pen or
draweth to him his typewriter and telleth
the tale of one Oswald Oswaldson,
whose father was a commercial traveller,
and who was heard frequently to com-
plain bitterly of railway restaurants so
that the child acquired a horror of travel-
ling in trains and, when his father in-
sisted on him becoming an engine-driver,
went forth and threw himself under the
4.40. From these and similar imbecilities,
Good Lord, deliver us.
Consider, further, that other and new-
est kind of sinner known as the prole-
tarian writer. He also getteth up in the
morning and curseth his wife for cook-
ing his egg hard and smacketh his chil-
dren for omitting to polish his foot-
wear. But their hearts he knoweth not.
Then lieth he on his bed and maketh
himself conversant with the doctrines of
Engels, Lenin and Marx, but only at
second-hand through reading “New
Masses” or “Proletariat,” for the original
works of those writers are Dreadfully
Long and require much concentration.
And he acquainteth himself with words
even longer than those that fall from
the lips of the eaters of the fruit of Freud.
From these words,
Good Lord, deliver us.
Then taketh he a sheet of paper and
inscribeth thereon his Proposed Cast of
Characters, in this wise:
Class-conscious hero: Bill Smith.
Semi-class-conscious heroine: Sarah Jones.
Bourgeois intellectual and low-comedy villain:
George Bernard Huxwclls.
Capitalist oppressor (villain proper): Arch-
bishop John D. Morganstein.
Then he maketh out a list of the most
popular revolutionary symbols and dis-
tributeth them amongst the subordinate
cast of workers, peasants and other
heroes of the class struggle. Then get-
teth he to work until the sun setteth or
even later. From Art as the Weapon of
the Worker,
Good Lord, deliver us.
From the Art of the learned in books,
Good Lord, deliver us.
We sinners do beseech thee to hear us,
O Lord ; and that it may please thee to
rule and govern our hearts so that we
may see Things as They Are, so that our
stomachs be not weakened and con-
founded with too much predigested
knowledge and our brains clouded with
too much learned ignorance.
We beseech Thee to hear us.
M. G. SKIPPER.
A Box-office Attraction
The Bulletin has received some press-
agent stuff about “The Squatter’s Daugh-
ter,” “with compliments from Stuart
F. Doyle.” The film, it seems, is “the
Greatest Box-Office Attraction in the
Industry’s history.” “Audited Figures tell
the Amazing Story. With an ordinary
programme, total takings in four days
£253. With ‘The Squatter’s Daughter,’
total takings £1597.” Also, “The Prime
Minister of Australia writes its eulogy;
‘A picture that will rebound [sic] to
the credit of Australia wherever it is
shown.’ ”
Of course “The Squatter’s Daughter”
is national publicity as politicians and
movie-exhibitors understand the phrase ;
The Bulletin said as much in its notice.
But, like 99 per cent, of movie advertise-
ments, the film is what Americans call
ballyhoo. The barbered landscapes,
the snowy, picturesquely-massed sheep,
the cocktail bar and luxurious swimming-
pool attached to an unpretentious old
homestead give essentially false impres-
sions of outback Australian life.
Ballyhoo is ideally suited for the pur-
pose of selling perishable goods like
movies; hence the pages of rapturous
drivel about talkie stars in the popular
press. It isn’t employed, however, to
advertise, say, steelworks or great ship-
ping lines, or any other concerns which
are required to stand the test of time;
and on the same principle it isn’t going to
do Australia much good in the long run.
For the rest, Mr. Stuart F. Doyle’s
enclosure is significant as a revelation of
the inspiration which is governing Aus-
tralia’s infant film industry. It is easy
to picture the final conference if the
Great Australian Film had been made
on the other side of the North Pacific.
Scenarist. —“Waal, you guys, you can con-
gratulate yourselves on having got about the
oldest melodrammer plaht in captivity. It wuz
a bahx-ahffice attraction before any of us wuz
bahn. Persecuted goil; thugs that wanner steal
her proputty; hero that turns out ter be the
Missing Heir—they’re all there.”
Camera-man. —“You’ll notice that I haven’t
made the mistake of indicating what outback
Australia really looks like. Instead, I’ve picked
out all the luscious bits, and turned the home
of the lovable old squatter, who’s pretending to
be blind so he can bowl out the thugs at the
finish, into a cross between a genuine Aussie
homestead and a millionaire’s place at Palm
Beach.”
Magnate. —“lt’s all right by me, boyce-—per-
vided the bahx-ahffice retoins is right. Get this
guy Joe Lines ter say it’s gonner rebound ter
the nation’s credit, an’ we’ll start the sales
campaign right away.”
Hollywood, in spite of its technical
and other achievements, has become a
term of opprobrium because its mag-
nates have measured everything in terms
of box-office returns, and, with that end
in view, have concentrated chiefly on the
screen equivalents of third-rate nine-
teenth-century melodramas. The Bulle-
tin’s objection to “The Squatter’s Daugh-
ter” is that it threatens to set a similar
fashion in Australia.
A Satchel of Books
Otho Jennings is the hero of Barbara
Goolden’s latest study ol nice upper
middle-class English people. Eros (Chap-
man and Hall ; 7s. 6d.) is its somewhat
deceptive title. The characters are all
so free lrom eroticisrn that there is
general surprise when Otho (he had a
kindly pale lace, with quiet grey eyes,
L 0 ?!® P ose and short grizzled moustache)
falls tor charming Grizel in the end. The
conversation is unilormly merry and
bright and the atmosphere ol springtime
England is agieeably conveyed.
Australia looms large in The Round
Table for September. In the usual
Dominions section the W.A. secession
movement, Upper House reform in N.
S. Wales and the Commonwealth’s atti-
tude toward the Ottawa Conference are
discussed, and “An Australian View of
the World Conference” states the view
of perhaps 75 per cent, of unbiassed
people in this country. “Capitalism and
Communism” sounds a sensational note.
If the Roosevelt campaign fails capital-
ism may continue to exist, “but it will
do so on a precarious tenure, and it may
be doubted if it will be for long.”
Biology in Everyday Life (Allen and
Unwin ; 3s. 6d.) consists of six broadcast
talks, five by Dr. John R. Baker and one
by Professor J. B. S. Haldane. The book
proper only has about 100 pages, but
each page has its deep thought approxi-
mating to that of Columbus about the
egg, inasmuch as it is obvious when
put into words. Sometimes there are
two or three of them.
The flea, which carries plague, and the louse,
which conveys typhus fever, have killed more
men than ever were killed by wolves. But we
have never organised against them as we have
against wolves, because they have never struck
the people's imagination as enemies of man.
The herd instinct makes us like to be in
crowds. Probably television will one day enable
us to have cinema shows broadcast to us in
our homes, but I am sure most people will
still flock to cinemas for the sake of the satis-
faction they get from being in a crowd, which
is swayed by the same emotions.
The conversational style makes this fas-
cinating stuff all the easier to read.
Grungunja is the hero of William Hat-
field’s Desert Saga (Angus and Robert-
son ; 6s.). We first meet him as an
uninitiate of nine. The Arunta tribe
to which he belongs is trekking across
the desert plains of Central Australia in
quest of water. He is a man, and marked as
such, when one day he is panic-stricken
by the spectacle of a creature “unbeliev-
ably big, resembling somewhat in bodily
structure the shape of a dog, a dog with
something on its back.” He has seen
his first mounted white man, forerunner
of the goldhunters who were to massacre
the bucks of his tribe and steal their
women. Grungunja, chief, warrior, poet
and seer, lives to be imprisoned by the
white men for cattle-spearing, and to be
an honored and devoted helper of white
men in a desert fever hospital. A fas-
cinating but saddening story. It stresses
the virtues of our aborigines—their cour-
age, loyalty and capacity for affection —
and between the lines the author says
plainly that these engaging people are
doomed.

THE BISHOPS TRIUMPH.
The week in the N.S.W. Parliament was
brightened for the audience in the gal-
leries by an attack on Stevens and his
Budget by Lang, and by an attack on
Lang and his Budget by Stevens. Accord-
ing to Lang, N. S. Wales, because of the
“frenzied accountancy of a panic-stricken
Treasurer,” is “at the end of its tether” ;
according to Stevens, it is “making won-
derful progress towards Budget equili-
brium,” the Lang version being the wild
tarradiddle of a Treasurer who had him-
self “brought the State to the verge of
bankruptcy.” Spooner joined in spiritedly
on Stevens’s side, and old hands were
heard to say that the House was back to
its best form.
Henry’s Divorce Bill became the sub-
ject for discussion; and the roaring ceased.
Presently the lion lay down with the
jackal (naturally Bligh-street and Goul-
burn-street differ as to which is the jackal
and which the lion); in other words, a
division was taken, and Stevens and 29
other Ministerialists were seen rubbing
shoulders with Lang and 19 of his fol-
lowers in the process of defeating the bill.
Its author had a mere seven supporters,
drawn from both Ministerial parties ; one
of them was Drummond, the Minister of
Education.
Yet it was a rather mild measure, when
all is said and done. It sought to make
insanity and separation for long periods
grounds for divorce, as they have been
in Maoriland for a good many years.
On certain points it did not go so far as
the Maoriland law. If passed, it would
have given legal sanction in N. S. Wales
to alliances formed in consequence of
divorces pronounced in Westralia and
Queensland, in addition to setting thou-
sands of miserable N. S. Wales people
free to marry again. In recommending
his bill to the House, the member for
Clarence quoted a letter from a woman
whose husband had died after 24 years
in an asylum and who, denied the right
to accept offers of remarriage, had, as
she wrote, been left “old, lonely,
desolate” ; but members were unmoved.
Some of them cracked bad jokes.
Lazzarini, one of the Labor members,
struck another note. He said that mar-
riage was a matter for the Church, and
not for the State, and that “anything
that set out to interfere with the family
unit was treason.” Ex-Speaker Burke,
supporting the Lazzarini view, added that
“no one with a tinge of religion could
believe in the marriage laws of Russia.”
The Burke party has gone to Russia for
so much of its programme—nationalisa-
tion of banking, socialisation of credit,
opposition to “British Imperialism,” and
so forth —that this repudiation of one part
of the gospel according to Lenin and
Stalin is at least interesting.
In 1911, after a Labor triumph at the
polls in Westralia, a member of the vic-
torious party introduced a bill extending
the legal grounds for divorce to, among
other things, wilful desertion by husband
or wife for three years and upwards. He
was not a Minister, but the Ministers sup-
ported him, and when a test vote was taken
the ayes, 28, were all Labor members.
Nor was the mover’s action regarded as
an offence against “Labor principles” ;
he held his seat at the next election,
became Chairman of Committees and ulti-
mately a Minister—though not in a Labor
Government. Since those days the Labor
party has travelled a great distance—•
backward; at least the N.S.W. Labor
party has. No member of the Lang
f group could introduce such a bill and
■ expect to achieve office or even to hold
his nomination at the next pre-selection
ballot.
In those days also Labor stood in
every State for free, compulsory and
secular education. Now both Lang
Labor and Federal Labor are com-
mitted to subsidies for N.S.W. denomina-
tional schools, and Lang Labor when in
office exempted so much church property
from municipal rates as to make it
almost impossible for some municipali-
ties to pay their way. Those who re-
turned it doubtless believed its protesta-
tions that it was a Labor party. In
respect of marriage and divorce laws and
education they have lived to see it be-
having just like a church party.
In Australia, as in other countries, the
people who hold that divorce should not
be allowed are notoriously in the
minority. The position of the minority is
to be respected, as all beliefs grounded
on conscience are entitled to be, but
this respect should not be carried to the
extent of yielding to the views professed
unless and until by orderly and recog-
nised processes the minority becomes a
majority. Divorce laws are on the Statute
Books of all the States. Except to those
who are against divorce altogether, the
desirableness of making these laws uni-
form, so that the grounds shall be the
same, the procedure simple and inex-
pensive and the judgments everywhere
effective, should make a strong appeal.
But the Commonwealth Parliament,
which was empowered by the people to
pass a uniform divorce law, has shirked
the duty for 33 years. And the N.S.W.
Parliament, as we have seen, has coldly
dismissed the appeals of those whose mar-
ried life has been blasted —husbands or
wives of the incurably insane and others
too decent to qualify for decrees by
becoming adulterers, drunkards or wife-
beaters.
Divorce is granted in N. S. Wales to
persons who married in haste and want to
be freed, because a new face has caught
their fancy, and who have the money to
bring suits for restitution of conjugal
rights and square the other person con-
cerned. It is refused to people with less
money, or none at all, who, because the
unfaithful partner is very often a nomad,
cannot prove domicile. Yet such people,
for the most part, are immeasurably more
deserving of divorce than the successful
parties to restitution suits ; and so are
most of those who pray for deliverance
from the living hell of marriage to
lunatics.
“Clericalism, there’s the enemy”! We
have never gone quite as far as that in
Australia, but in the past Australians
made no mean contribution to the war
for the liberation of humanity from
church control in secular matters. It is
disconcerting to see so many of our
lawmakers retracing their steps —to see
a group which claims to stand for the
people making a party matter of a bill
liberalising divorce, and members of
other parties voting with it in ignoble
surrender to the clamor of bishops, some
of the ultramontane sort and others with
minds which are back in the days of
ecclesiastical courts. The thing is alarm-
ing when one considers that, with the
enfranchisement of women and the press-
ing of their claim for equality with the
other sex, Parliaments are likely to be
more and more concerned with marriage,
divorce and the guardianship of infants,
and that other questions are arising
which may bring the State into conflict
with the Church. Shall imbeciles who
are not under restraint be allowed to
marry and bring more imbeciles into the
world? Shall imprisonment be society’s
sole means of protection against the
beasts who prey on children? Such
questions are being discussed in all coun-
tries, and decisions will have to be taken.
It all suggests that the people will
need to be more particular about the
persons or objects they send to Parlia-
ment and the terms on which the persons
or objects go there.
GERMANY’S DIFFICULTIES.
While Hitlerism has lent a truculent
complexion to Germany’s foreign policy,
the German people have difficulties, psy-
chological and financial, which the out-
side world must not ignore.
The French are still nervous about
Germany. Even their Petain line and their
great aerial force do not make them feel
safe, and they will never be satisfied till
their frontier reaches the Rhine. They
have Alsace and Lorraine, but many of
the Alsatians still speak the German
tongue and long for Teutonic rule. More
potent a factor than all, there are mil-
lions of Germans from 18 to 30 years
old to whom the war is only a childhood
memory. The number of these grows
steadily. Each year the vision of their
lost colonies, the recollection of French
bayonets in the heart of their occupied
industrial districts, of the whittling down
of their empire on its eastern side, be-
come more and more a nightmare to
them. . ,
Germany has been sorely tried since the
war, and even if it is the fault of its own
statesmen its people would not be
human if they did not chafe under the
strain. It has had to face four financial
crises since 1923-24, when even a mil-
lion marks was waste paper. It has been
refloated on the Dawes Plan and the
Young Plan. It has tried every expedient
to bring prosperity ; has sold its securi-
ties for foreign gold, and borrowed to
the limit of its credit, till it has accumu-
lated a post-war debt of £800,000,000
gold sterling. Its building programme of
the years before the depression was an
amazing effort at self-preservation. The
Germans built vast workers’ settlements,
permanent exhibitions to attract trade,
liners to capture the Atlantic blue ribbon,
radio stations which were unequalled in
equipment outside the 8.8. C., fleets of
modern cargo ships, the most extensive
and best-organised aerial service in
Europe. They competed in Asiatic
markets with their conquerors, and often
beat them.
While Stresemann was alive Germany
even secured the confidence of its erst-
while enemies. Stresemann, Briand and
Chamberlain shared the Nobel Peace
Prize when Germany had been admitted
to the League of Nations, seven years
after Versailles. But 1931 saw the coun-
try again in the trough. It needed the
Hoover debt holiday and another foreign
loan and a Reparations Conference to
save it. At that conference the Germans
lost everything Stresemann had gained for
them when their representative Bruening
said, with obvious intention: “We shall
never be able to pay reparations again.”
From then onwards sectionally led,
with nearly half its people unemployed,
with France unpaid and suspicious, a
disturbed Austria below and the troubles
of the Polish Corridor on its eastern
flank, Germany lost its leadership. Its
Communist party grew in strength to
6,000,000. There were 7,000,000 social-
ists. In a moment of panic and despair
it surrendered to Hitler.
The situation from this point onward
only differs in degree from that of N. S.
Wales in 1931-32. Few people listening
to the tirades of Australian Labor against
Hitlerism realise how close it is to Lang-
ism, which is merely Hitlerism unaccom-
plished. Hitler personally is like Lang.
He has the loud voice, the isolated mind,
the delight in invective, the capacity for
political shock tactics which characterise
the pride of Auburn. His party is tech-
nically—and in name, too —a “working-
men’s socialist party.” He aims, as does
Lang, at socialisation of credit. Like Lang,
too, he passed through the stage of aban-
doning rank-and-file rule for a new con-
ception, which would involve Parliament
using its powers to destroy its own influ-
ence and ultimately lodge permanent
governing authority in one class, func-
tioning through a dictatorship. Beasley,
the Lang party’s Federal leader, was
quite frank about this ideal on the plat-
forms of Bulli last May. Hitler even
had his Garden in one Feder, who made
his policy.
Understanding the analogy, it is easier
to get the German position in a truer
perspective. The axe for Communists
and the whip for the Jews in Germany
are the equivalent of Lang’s capital levy.
The Nazi marchings have their parallel
in the antics of the N. S. Wales Labor
“army” of 1931 and the massed battalions
of the Sydney demagogue’s pre-election
ballyhoos. The New Guard, with its
ribbon-cutters, represented the Stahlhelm,
and Hitler’s sudden withdrawal from the
Disarmament Conference and the
League was achieved with a technique
which he might well have learnt by
studying Lang’s withdrawal from the
Premiers’ Conference. His threats to
arm have somewhat the same ring as
those which went forth from Macquarie-
street when the Taxation Department
was in process of capture.
Finally, Hitler and Germany are very
much in the same position as the Lang
Government and N. S. Wales in May
last year. They have given notice of with-
drawal from the League. They are full
of threats, somewhat softened as the
days go by, but still amenable to a higher
authority, which is the armed might of
Europe. Germany could not rearm and
make war without the sanction of Eng-
land because, with the North Sea Fleet
gone and its big guns and land forts dis-
mantled, it could this time be thoroughly
blockaded. Germany could not again
fight a land war on two fronts. The
first hint of aggression would bring French
troops pouring into the Saar Valley and
the Ruhr to appropriate the coal and
metals which are the lifeblood of Teu-
tonic armament. On the eastern side
Polish interests would rush to save the
Corridor.
If the nations remain sane, the posi-
tion is fairly safe. But it would be
safer with a firmer British policy, and
with fewer peacemakers like the some-
what fatheaded Henderson careering
round the Continent. The real danger
lies in the chance of Germany, in the
throes of its agony, catching somebody
half-accidentally with its fangs ; and that
is not a very great one as long as the
Powers are firm on the armaments ques-
tion and reasonably sympathetic towards
the Germans in their troubles.
DEFAULT HAS BEEN TRIED.
What a clumsy liar Lang is! Railing at
Stevens’s Budget in the manner of a
nark who hates to see things on the
improve, he once more suggested that
Australia should save itself by working
an interest ramp on Britain, and insinu-
ated that the Old Man had set the
example:
When Britain found it could no longer main-
tain its interest payments, it forwarded to its
creditor a small amount, which it' termed a
token payment, and announced that it was
unable to make payment in full, and conse-
quently did not intend to do so. By avoiding
excessive interest payments, Britain, according
to Mr. Runciman, has again become the
strongest financial country.
Runciman may have said that Britain
has again become the strongest financial
country, but he did not say that it was
by avoiding excessive interest payments ;
he is not such a combination of knave
and fool. And Britain did not tell the
U.S.A. that it was unable to make pay-
ment in full and did not intend to do so.
President Roosevelt, in acknowledging the
token payment, expressly declared that
the transaction did not amount to de-
fault. Apparently Lang hates England
so much that he can’t help telling lies
about it.
This brazen mob-leader did more than
any other post-war State Treasurer and
Premier to plunge his country into debt.
“What is wrong with achieving debt re-
mission for our people according to the
British method?” he asks, interest default
being “the British method,” as he sees it.
Everything is wrong with it; but the
objection that might be expected to
appeal to Lang, if he had any brains, is
that it would hurt us more than it would
hurt the other party.
Britain made the last payment to the
U.S.A. in silver. Previously it paid in
gold ; it had to —Uncle won’t take goods.
We pay our interest to Britain in goods.
If Australia were to say “We will only
give you 10 per cent, of the interest we
pledged ourselves to pay,” the Britons
would very probably reply “Then we’re
dashed if we’re going to help you to
‘scale’ us. We can get any amount of
wheat, butter, frozen meat, fruit, wine
and so forth from countries which are
honestly trying to meet their engage-
ments. So take your supplies into some
other market, if you can find one.” It
would be only human nature. The
fiercest wars are civil wars, and no frauds
sting people more than those committed
on them by members of their own family.
There is a startling likeness between
Lang’s policy and De Valera’s. The
latter gentleman has even imposed a
newspaper tax, as Lang tried to do ; and
he defaulted on the land annuities, as
Lang would no doubt have done had he
been President of the Free State. Britain
retaliated ; and a Dublin contributor to
the “Round Table,” most dispassionate of
quarterlies, summarises the results:
Last year total national expenditure was
£28,849,739 (sterling); this year it will be
£31,529,220. Last year’s revenue came to
£29,990,935; thia year it will not exceed
£26,440,000. Even after again appropriating the
payments withheld from Britain Mr. MacEntee
budgets for a deficiency of £5,089,220
Fianna Fail promised to reduce taxation by
nearly £2,000,000; it has increased it by nearly
£4,000,000 For the year ending in May, the
total commerce of the Free State has fallen by
£26,000,000. In proportion to the total volume
of trade, which is little more than two-thirds of
what it was in the preceding year, the adverse
balance has risen by about 30 per cent. For
every form of livestock there has been a ruinous
fall of price. In dry cattle alone the Free State
farmer has suffered an estimated capital loss of
£10,000,000 sterling, and in income a loss of at
least £7,500,000 sterling.
So default is apt to ruin the defaulter.
This paper strove against frenzied over-
seas borrowing, and was jeered at for
its pains by the borrowers and by gutter
rags that egged them on. It never had
any illusions about the people who lent
the money—chiefly, it should be said,
for “works” from which Australia is
still drawing revenue, such as it is,
whereas Britain is getting no return from
its immense war debt to Uncle —but re-
gard for their own interests would have
prompted them to listen favorably to the
argument that, with commodity prices
gone to the bow-wows, it would be only
a fair thing to Australia to reduce sub-
stantially the high price they charged
for accommodation in the loan-drunk
days. The proposal was made, and
conversion is in progress. But it was
seriously delayed, and is still endangered,
by the crazy agitation of the boss-de-
faulter, who was the worst of the loan-
drunkards.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
At the Burglar’s Hour.
As a result of hurried meetings held after
midnight, members of the House of
Reps, voted themselves and the Senators
an increase of £75 p.a., making the
salary £825 p.a. The thirteen Ministers
will receive the rise as members ; and
the emoluments of the nine Ministers
of State are to be increased from
£11,710 to £12,240; they, in effect, will
get another £l5O p.a. The scheme was
rushed through on the initiative of Mar-
tens, Federal Labor member for Her-
bert, but members of all parties were
in it, and the nation will hold the Lyons
Government chiefly responsible. The
grab was agreed to by 44 votes to 16, on
the following division:
Ayes: Abbott, Baker, Beasley, Blakeley, Casey,
Corser, Dein, Forde, Francis, Gander, Gardner,
A. Green, R. Green, Groom, Guy, E. J. Harrison,
Holloway, Holman, Hunter, Hutchinson, James,
Jennings, Lane, G. Lawson, J. Lawson, Lyons,
Makin, Maloney, Marr, Martens, McNicoll,
Parkhill, Perkins, Price, Riley, Riordan, Rose-
vear, Scullin, Stewart, Thompson, Thorby,
Ward, Watkins and White.
Noes: Bell, Blacklow, Cameron, Dennis,
Fenton, Gabb, Gregory, E. F. Harrison, Hut-
chin, Maxwell, Mcßride, Natrn, Nock, Prowse,
Stacey and Watson.
Pairs: Collins and Latham, for the grab;
Scholfield and Hawker, against it.
The thing was doubly indecent because
the plotters chose a moment when Earle
Page was not in Canberra, and when
Paterson, his deputy, also was absent.
Both would have taken a stand against it.
The gentlemen concerned in the grab
were in such a hurry to reward them-
selves that they departed from their cus-
tom of adjourning for breakfast after an
all-night sitting; of course £75 (£l5O
for Ministers of State) will buy a multi-
tude of breakfasts.
Gabb said during the debate that the
raid on the public purse and the manner
in which it was being consummated made
him ashamed of being a member—made
him want to walk out of the House for
ever ; and every decent elector will sympa-
thise with him. The atrocity was com-
mitted on a day when the N.S.W. basic
wage was cut from £3 Bs. 6d. per week to
£3 6s. 6d. for men and from £1 17s. to
£1 16s. for women. Two shillings a week
off the wage for workers ; 30s. a week
on the wage for talkers!
It is a far cry to the days of Bruce,
who did not take his salary as Prime
Minister until it was represented to him
that, by not collecting it, he was em-
barrassing members to whom politics
was a living. Had Bruce been in control
at Canberra the disgraceful scenes of the
week-end would not have been wit-
nessed; but Australia is now ruled by
politicians with other views.
The Parliamentary salary was £4OO
p.a. from. 1901 till 1907 ; £6OO p.a. from
that year till 1920, when Hughes—also
without reference to the people—raised
it to £lOOO p.a. It stood at £BOO when
the present Representatives were elected ;
so they are coolly awarding themselves
£25 p.a. more than they agreed to serve
for. And this at a time when the wheat-
growers and fruitgrowers are on the
rocks, and when hundreds of thousands
of wage-earners are still unemployed!
At the beginning of the week Australia
was waiting, without much hope, for the
Senate to do the honest and decent thing.

The Air-minded Australian.
It has been estimated that 100,000 people
witnessed Kingsford Smith’s arrival at
Essendon, and that another 100,000 lined
the route to Melbourne; yet there is
nothing very spectacular in the landing
of an aeroplane. It seems that Aus-
tralians are responding to environment.
In the fifteenth century Portugal, a small
country, became the world’s greatest sea
Power. Its coastline looked on an ocean
which was handy to sea-lanes that led to
rich undiscovered countries. Also, it had
the luck to have a ruler of genius, Prince
Henry. Henry took an intense interest in
geography, built docks, arsenals and ob-
servatories, gathered round him great
navigators and men of science and bore
the expense of numerous expeditions.
Portugal dropped out of the race be-
cause it had neither the men nor the
money to colonise its acquisitions, and
because it mixed the hardy Lusitanian
blood with the blood of negroes. The
fight for supremacy was taken up by the
Dutch and English. Then the Dutch fell
behind, though they created a tradition
that survives in the great Dutch shipping
lines, one of which carries a large part
of the sea-borne trade of Australia.
Britain secured and maintained the
supremacy because it was an island
which contained the raw materials for
building ships, the men to man them and
the need for expansion.
Australia has tried to make itself into
a sea Power, but only in a half-hearted
manner, for its back has really been
turned to its enormous coastline while it
looked inland at a vast undeveloped
hinterland. Its few seamen are as good
as any others, but modern ships are
enormously expensive, and Australia has
been obliged to let Britain build them
for it.
The aeroplane comes under a different
category. It is cheap, and could be pro-
duced in this country in requisite quan-
tities. It is necessary both for the
development of the interior and for the
conquest of the distance which lies be-
tween Australia and the other continents.
It provides the required conditions for
resolute young men to carve out a career
for themselves. The aviators who hop
from Lympne to Darwin or Wyndham
or Derby (Charles Ulm has cut Kings-
ford Smith’s record to 6 days 17| hours)
are in the direct line with the navi-
gators who rounded the Horn and
anchored at Manila. It only needs a
Prince Henry to make Australians com-
pletely air-minded.
Prince Henrys don’t grow in demo-
cratic Governments, which are usually
composed of elderly gentlemen who have
made a success of life by doing and
saying the obvious. Australia is at pre-
sent ruled by a beautiful example. At
the moment he is playing for safety by
supporting a scheme of inter-Imperia/
aerial communication which has aroused
a storm of criticism in England and
Australia alike, and which moved an
English pilot to tell a Singapore paper
that Australian official aviation is
apparently under the control of troglo-
dytes.
«
City Forests.
Colonel F. W. G. Annand, formerly
town clerk of Brisbane, has suggested
that, in place of the pottering schemes of
unemployment-relief which local authori-
ties and Governments love to devise,
some out-of-works in Brisbane should
be put on to develop city forests on
the thousands of acres of now almost
valueless land which have fallen into
public hands round the suburbs.
It is a good thought. Many a Euro-
pean city has its own timber supply
grown on its own territory. In India,
every canal bank carries its belt of com-
mercial trees, which are expected in
most cases to pay for canal upkeep.
Ballarat earns £lOOO per annum by the
sale of cullings from its municipal
forest. Even in Canberra it has been
shown how readily and quickly these
things can be done. Mount Stromlo was
a bare hill with gnarled snow gums and
untidy dead logs littering its sides before
the war. To-day, its million trees form
at the same time a valuable asset and a
tourist attraction.
Brisbane is exceptionally lucky in its
surroundings. Its open spaces are wider
than those of most cities. Its climate is
suitable for the growth of a wealth of
beautiful trees. Its central Botanical
Gardens are among the finest anywhere
in the Southern Hemisphere. The plant-
ing of such open spaces as Victoria Park
with well-tended trees would add greatly
to its amenities.
Apart from city and suburban plant-
ing, there is a great deal of arboreal
work to be done on the roadsides. No
country in the world keeps its roads so
bare and unsheltered as does Australia.
Certainly Victoria has set many of its
highways between lines of pine and plane.
But in N. S. Wales and Queensland
there are tracks on which the sun beats
down unchecked for mile after mile.
Hundreds of acres comprised in the
strip on either side of the paving are
barren wastes producing nothing but
washaways. What a different track the
Sydney-Canberra National Highway
would be if it ran between a double line
of tall timber!
»
Old Age.
They had a symposium on old age at
Melbourne University the other day in
which some of Australia’s most success-
ful ancients took part. Frank Gavan
Duffy, Chief Justice of the High Court,
who is 81, says “man becomes old when
he no longer desires to achieve.” John
MacFarland, a year older and still Chan-
cellor of the Uni., says the test is
“whether a man can put his trousers on
in the morning without sitting down.”
No doubt Zaro Agha, the Turk, who is
156. would reverse this and suggest that
senility comes when a man is no longer
able to remove his nether coverings with-
out getting up.
Some people think they are ancient
when they lose their teeth. F. T. Brent-
nail, chided in Brisbane for expressing
the hope that a firm of which he was a
director would pay “more and more divi-
dends,” responded with all the conviction
that comes at 86 that when he did not
desire more dividends he would feel that
life had no further use for him. Glad-
stone was a Prime Minister in his
eighties. Hindenburg seems to be able to
manage Hitler and a nation of 60,000,000
people fairly well at 86. While the Nazis
have silenced 6,000,000 Communists, they
have not got rid of him. Rocke-
feller plays golf at 94. George Judah
Cohen still attends to his affairs in Syd-
ney at 91.
In fact, the only certain way to decide
whether you are old is to join the civil
service. Irrespective of whether an
under-secretary can put on his trousers
standing up, iving down, horizontal or
perpendicular, Stevens, in N. S. Wales,
says he is past the stage of responsible
labor at 60. Some other Premiers plump
for 65. But the limit, of course, does
not apply to Premiers.

More Charity.
In 1932-33 the N. S. Wales State lottery
took £2,135,763 in ticket-money, out of
Which it paid £1,315,710 in prizes. Of its
gross surplus, £820,053, £62,126 went
in running expenses, leaving £757,927
for the hospitals, for whose benefit the
business is supposed to be run. There
are no figures to show what the syndi-
cates who batten on the business took,
but there are so many of them that the
amount must have been considerable.
Then some of the hospitals which pre-
sumably benefit from the State lottery
get permission to hold lotteries of their
own, in which the number of tickets
issued is limited only by the number of
tickets the public will take. Their ex-
penses are not low, if one may judge
from their quarters, staffs and extensive
advertising. Allowing for the return of
prize-money, it seems probable that the
amount poured into the coffers of vari-
ous official and unofficial gambling joints
in N. S. Wales alone reaches £2,000,000
per annum.
It doesn’t sound much in terms of
money—it amounts to 3.7 d. per head of
population per week ; but in terms of
performance, if properly applied, it
could do a lot. It could, for instance,
give every youngster born in N. S. Wales
a decent financial start in life and con-
siderably reduce old-age-pension lia-
bility. A life policy for £lOOO with the
A.M.P. taken out for a child at birth
costs £7 10s. per annum. On an aver-
age 50,000 children are born in N. S.
Wales each year ; so that the £2,000,000
so carelessly thrown away could com-
fortably carry £lOOO cover for every
child born from now onward until it
reached the age of 21. At that age the
beneficiary would be able to go into the
world well insured, and with the cer-
tainty that bonuses would enable him
to approach his old age with a negotiable
security worth a couple of thousand
pounds behind him. Any family with
husband and wife each provided for in
that way would not need old-age pen-
sions.
Utopia, however, is still far off. The
politicians who allow lottery promoters
and syndicates to rake off hundreds of
thousands of pounds per annum would
baulk like frightened horses if anybody
suggested that they should collect and
use £2,000,000 per annum on such a
project.

Another Secession Movement.
The chiefs of Inner Mongolia, who are
descendants of the Great Khans, have
sent an ultimatum to the doddering
Nanking Government demanding self-
government, otherwise they will seek
assistance from a friendly neighbor.
There are two neighbors prepared to be
friendly—Japan and Russia.
Japan has long shown an affectionate
interest in Inner Mongolia. In 1915 it
served China with a writ known as the
Twenty-one Demands, one of which was
that Mongolia should be handed over.
When the Germans collapsed Japan had
to restrict its ambitions, and it concen-
trated on Manchuria. The Inner Mon-
golian ultimatum indicates that the
Russo-Japanese typhoon, having settled
somewhat in Manchuria, has broken out
in a fresh place.
The Chinese call Mongolia the Rain-
less Sea, also the Sandy Waste. Both
appellations are misnomers. Mongolia
is as large as the British provinces of
India, half the area of Britain’s African
possessions, six times the size of Ger-
many and more than a hundred times as
large as Holland. It has no more desert
than Australia, and is so fertile to the
south that the Chinese market gardener
has been advancing into the province at
the rate of a mile a year on a front of
200 miles. The country contains 2\ mil-
lion nomads, who spend their time
tramping about over soil that is said to
be rich in minerals. It is a tempting
prize and it is on the direct line of com-
munication between China and Europe.
The Czars long had their eyes on
Mongolia, and their successors the Bol-
sheviks, contrary to their alleged anti-
imperialistic aspirations, kept the eyes of
the awakened proletariat in the same
direction. By 1925 the situation was such
that Moscow was able to inform the
Chinese Government that the Red Army
would be withdrawn from Outer Mon-
golia “as soon as circumstances per-
mitted the usual formula. In the same
year Comrade Chicherin said at Tiflis
that the Soviet Government recognised
Mongolia as part of the Chinese Repub-
lic, but added significantly that “it ought
to be noted that, after several crises, the
internal situation has settled down and
been consolidated on a basis somewhat
similar to that of the Soviet system.”
The fact that the Inner Mongolians
have addressed their ultimatum to the
Chinese doesn’t mean that the Chinese
have any real control of the future of
the province. At one time their depen-
dencies included Sinkiang, Manchuria,
Mongolia and Tibet —an area larger than
the U.S.A. —and they drew tribute from
Annam, Tongking, Korea and Burma;
even, at times, from Nippon. They lost
most of these possessions and emolu-
ments, not as a result of wars with a
foreign aggressor, but through sheer in-
ertia. They lost Manchuria to Japan
through excess of the same vice or vir-
tue, though they were able to cut a dash
before the League as an injured party.

These Brazen Hussies.
“El Verdugo” stands up for them:
“Paganism knew little worse than the semi-
nudity of females on our beaches,” said
Queensland’s Archbishop Duhig the other day.
“Even in Greece and Rome the backless bath-
ing suit would have been condemned as offen-
sive alike to art and modesty.... Even the
children, it is commonly said, know more about
sex at 12 or 13 than their grandparents did
at 40.” In the result, “womanhood” is “rapidly
deteriorating. Women are encouraged.... to
plunge into manners and habits that can only
end in degradation.”
If Paganism knew little worse than the
present beach dress, it must have been some
sort of Paganism which has had no history.
Gentlemen in ancient Greece ran their races in
the garb in which they were born. Greek
statues which survive suggest that wool and
rayon were considerably dearer in ancient days
than they are now.
If womanhood is “deteriorating” physically
the medical statistics arc all wrong. Our women
live longer and look healthier and happier than
women did in the blessed age of Queen Vic-
toria, which provides clerics with a model
period. The illegitimate birth-rate of Australia
has fallen over 16 per cent, since before the
war. Charges of drunkenness and misbehavior
against women in the courts have declined to
the lowest point in history, and general crime
has so far gone out of fashion with the fair
sex that in Dr. Duhig’s own city his Majesty’s
hotel facilities not long ago were maintained
for the benefit of a solitary and casual female
boarder.
I know a lot of places in the white world
where there is more nudity on the beaches
than there is ever likely to be in Australia. At
old-fashioned resorts on the Black Sea ladies
and gentlemen remove their shirts on the open
beach and enter the water together, garbed in
sunshine; but the spectacle is not demoralising
—it’s merely dull. And the most moral people
in the world are the wild Australian aboriginals,
among whom wardrobes commonly consist of a
couple of dogteeth (worn by father) on a string.

Wells At It Again.
“Pa wang” : Wells, the ebullient, has
published another prophecy of the future,
this time concerning what the world will
be like in a.d. 2060. A world State run
by all-wise heads will control transport,
which means controlling everything;
everybody will be incredibly well off;
Christianity will be a dead letter, the pre-
vailing religion being atheistical Com-
munism dedicated to Progress, and the
Bad, the Ugly and the False will have
been replaced by the Good, the True and
the Beautiful. All these wonders will
be achieved as the result of a series of
devastating wars which will lay waste
civilisation.
Mr. Wells is an amusing contradic-
tion of his own thesis. He is a very
distinguished man; he is an idealist;
he wishes nothing better than the well-
being of humanity. Yet if the world
State had existed in his lifetime, and by
some quirk of fate he had seized the
dictatorship, what would he have done
with it? Judging by his own career, he
would have started off with a sort of
mechanical socialism. Then he would
have switched over to the rule of an aris-
tocracy of intellect. Before the Great
War he was an ardent anti-imperialist
and pacifist, but during that upheaval he
became as John Bullish as Blatchford.
After the war Wells hailed the League
of Nations as a world-saviour. Now
he loathes the thing. In the religious
field he at one time abolished Chris-
tianity, invented a pantheon of his
own, populated it with fresh deities and
then forgot all about them. All his life
he has been a robust hater and intoler-
ant of opposition. Translated into poli-
tical terms, he has been a cross between
a Nero and a Marcus Aurelius, and has
changed his mind as often as our Billy.
Yet Wells is miles superior to the type
of person who seizes political power or
who gets voted into it.

"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Sixenate”: A prevalent bogey made a
brief sensational appearance in a Sydney
suburban police court. The case arose
out of a domestic quarrel, the wife
being the complainant. Her husband
looked apologetic and foreign ; in reply
to a question about his nationality he
claimed to be British. “No, no, he’s an
Alsatian, your Worship,” cut in the wife
excitedly. The effect was immediate ; the
magistrate paled slightly and cast a keen,
suspicious look at the defendant; the
clerk of the court grasped a ruler, and
policemen tensed. But, although he
admitted having been born in Alsace, the
cases against the defendant were dis-
missed. The well-timed interjection
might have done him irreparable injury
in some places, but Australian courts are
fortunately above prejudice.

“X.S.”: Melbourne now has its sixth
wireless patrol. The new recruit, the
first to be equipped with botlj-ways com-
munication, is a blue monster of 50 h.p.
and 12 cylinders, and can touch 90 miles
“Late again, Miss Pippsey!”
“Yessir. I sprained my ankle running for the tram”
“H'm! Another lame excuse!”
an hour. It is worth noting that Mel-
bourne was the first city in Australia, if
not in the world, to exploit the notion.
Russell-street got its first inkling of the
value of radio during the police strike,
when the city heaved in the throes of
a minor revolution. Amateur wireless
men were stationed in city buildings and
kept G.H.Q. at the Town Hall apprised
of the movements of the mob. The first
try-out of a wireless patrol was in 1925,
when broadcasting was in its infancy,
To satisfy himself, Commissioner Blarney
accompanied the car and helped to lay
a motor thief by the heels. Two cars,
one with and one without the ether ear,
were put on, and the wireless car usually
beat the other to it. There are now over
50 men in the branch, and citizens feel
a sense of security when they see one
of the vehicles gently lazing through
their suburb with the operator’s ear glued
to the headphones.

“Lao-dah”: As an old cable hand I
am impressed with the specifications for
the new cable between Victoria and
Tassie, for which the P.M.G. is now call
ing tenders. The first cable to obtain my
services was the just-laid Adelaide-Pertn
section. It worked one way
at a time ; you sent by hand
and when you were talking
the man at the other end
couldn’t interrupt you, even
if he wanted to. You sent ten
messages in a batch and then
you put your switch to “re-
ceive,” and as like as not the
other man said, “Sorry, me
ink failed,” and you had to
start all over again. The new
cable, which will run from
Lome to King Island and
thence to Stanley and across
the island, is to have seven
telephone channels, five tele-
graph channels and one
channel for the relay of
broadcasts. The estimated
cost is £lBO,OOO. In other
words, it is going to do what
13 of the old lines couldn’t
have done, for telephonic
communication was impracticable on the
old types. And, it is interes.ting to note,
since prophets said that wireless would
be the death of the cable, that it is the
application of radio technique that has
made this marvel possible.

“Spokeshave”: Melbourne’s endeavor
to create a tradition by buying up Eng-
lish navigators’ cottages follows a bad
American precedent. Henry Ford has
spent a portion of his wealth in purchas-
ing English country inns and ancient
monuments and scattering them with a
lavish hand about the U.S.A., where they
look as appropriate as a petrol bowser
in St. Paul’s Cathedral. At one time he
had dozens of men raking England for
antiquities until public opinion in that
country rose against him.
* * * *
“Mells”: Handsome wads of money or
its equivalent continue to turn up in most
unlikely places. Not long ago an old
man who looked nearly destitute died in
a Sydney hospital, and might have been
buried as a pauper if a nurse hadn’t hap-
pened on £l7OO or thereabouts tied up
with his scanty belongings in a locker.
And only last week an aged, ragged and
shockingly unfragrant drunk was picked
out of a Darlinghurst gutter and lodged
in the lock-up. The police searchers
tackled him in very gingerly fashion,
but distaste changed to utter amazement
when it was revealed that the deadbeat
was carrying nearly £3OOO about his in-
salubrious person, mostly in Treasury
bonds. As the ancient had been on a
prolonged jag it was regarded as little
short of miraculous that he hadn’t been
robbed or murdered, as he doubtless
would have been if any evil-disposed
person had suspected him of possessing
a hundredth or a thousandth part of
what he was staggering around with. It
just shows that there is no better pro-
tection fpr portable wealth than the
appearance of absolute poverty. Still,
the miser who goes on a bender and
sleeps in gutters is a bit out of the
ordinary.

“Dr. Nil”: The mispronunciation of
such a place-name as Cottesloe (W.A.I,
noted by “Swanbourne” (B. 11/10/’33),
is natural enough seeing that the way in
which scores of English words are
sounded locally is more often than not
unknown to the outside world: e.g.,
“Darby,” for Derby; “Marribon,” for
Mary-le-bone. But 1 was surprised when
I was told that a certain piece of music
was “The Dure-ham March,” and when
“What would you do if you picked the
winner in the twenty-five thousand
pound lottery?”
“Marry him, of course!”
I was asked by an Australian University
gra'duate whether I would have some
“Wur-sess-ter” sauce. There are excuses
for these gaffes, but none for spelling
and pronouncing Cullanulla Beacn
“Cronulla.” The born Australian is lazy
in his speech, hence the transition from
“Cullanulla” through “Curranulla” to
“Cronulla.” As regards British family
names, their distortion and abbreviation
seopi to be a kind of shibboleth with the
clans that boast of them. “Can’t be one
of us; why, he actually didn’t know how
to pronounce ‘Cohoon’!”
* * * *
“Max”: “Philistine” misses the point
when he suggests than an artist’s objec-
tion to Sydney Harbor Bridge is merely
a prejudice against metal (B. 11/10/ ’33).
Artists have worked in metals since pre-
historic times. This is a matter solely of
a large object badly designed in relation
to its setting. If “Philistine” stands on
any hillside giving a fair panoramic view
of Sydney and foreshores, he will see
that the monstrous arch of the bridge in
low-set, spreading country breaks almost'
every known rule of design. These rules
are not mere whims of teachers and
pedants: they are the basic principles of
that subtle combination of optics and
mathematics which has come to be called
beauty of form or line. The bridge de-
signers were concerned only with build-
ing a bridge, and what they call design
means the proper arrangement of dur-
able materials; aesthetic considerations
are not expected from engineers.

“S.T.S.”: Glenelg (S.A.) has seen a
neat piece of flying. Lawrence New-
man, an Airways pilot, was up with a
passenger who accidentally switched off
the engine, which cut out when the
throttle was opened again. Newman had
just time to glide down to Broadway, a
quiet street, duck under the electric-light
wires and land against the wind at 50
m.p.h., after which he was able to fly
home.
* * * *
“Kerys”: It’s hard to give up a life
interest even when the necessity for work
is over. We recently had a call from an
elderly, well-dressed man, who inquired
if we possessed a grandfather clock. As
our timepieces are all of the three-and-
eleven nickel variety, we couldn’t oblige
him, but we learned that he went con-
tinually round the country ministering
to the ancient clocks still to be found
occasionally in old homes. What is
more, it was entirely a labor of affection
for the splendid old timepieces, which
demand more sympathetic attention than
the modern repairer is wont to give them.
He makes no charge whatever for his
services, and covers long distances in
order to call periodically on some speci-
ally beloved grandfather.
* * * *
“Super”: The most bitter complaint
I have heard about the new ten-shilling
note came from our blacksmith. Accord-
ing to him the illustration depicts a right-
handed smith using a left-hand anvil ;
that is, he is standing on the wrong side
of it. The matter has become such an
obsession with him that he carefully
examines every new note to see if the
bloomer has been rectified.
“Vulcan”: Since inquests on the Com-
monwealth’s new ten-bob note are in
order, might I mildly inquire of the
anonymous artist why the dynamo—at
least, I suppose it is a dynamo—is so
badly distorted that the armature couldn’t
possibly revolve, and why the combina-
tion punching-press and lathe in the
background (a conglomeration unknown
to mechanical science) has a bed with a
Grecian curve and legs like a viaduct?
Also why the cove who is carrying books
gathered up the little ones first? Also
I’d like to know a dickens of a lot of
things concerning the mechanism of the
potter’s wheel, and why a benevolent
old party in what (I assume) is some sort
of professorial robe is represented as
holding a model aeroplane. All that the
doctors of science ever did for aviation
could be stuck in a thimble.
* * * *
“Jerrick”: “With the vicious bullets
whistling their song of death,” says
“Hamer” in his yarn “Courage” (B.
4/10/’33) ; and again, “The waspy ping-
ing of bullets was now in the air.” It is
a curious slip in a really fine study of
battle thought and battle scene. A high-
velocity bullet cracks and, unless it has
ricocheted, does nothing else in the way
of sound. It is the low-velocity variety
that buzzes waspishly, or whistles or
swishes. I have only once read in fiction
a correct description of the sound of high-
velocity bullets, and the author was a
woman. In effect she says: “They lay
between the firing armies and it seemed
as if a thousand whips cracked overhead
all day.” Another woman, one of the
Mack sisters (Amy E., I think), lecturing
at Liverpool camp to a party of departing
Diggers, of whom I was one, said: “I
was a little surprised at the sound of the
rifle-fire [in Belgium]. It sounded like
the snapping of twigs.” This is an equally
correct description of high-velocity bullet
sound (not rifle explosions). The “snap”
is a loud, clear crack, loud enough to be
called a crash when heard close. Take
a service rifle and fire into a high wind
and the sound becomes a relatively long-
drawn crash, the wind bringing it back
to you in a stream, as it were. Get into
the pit with a marker on a rifle range and
listen carefully. You will first hear the
bullet, which travels somewhere about
2200 feet a second ; and at a distinct in-
terval afterwards the grunt of the rifle
explosion, which will have travelled on
to you at 1100 feet per second. As well
call the roar of a deep-toned steam whistle
“mewing” or “hissing” as call tho sound
of a high-velocity bullet that has not
ricocheted “pinging” or “whistling.” And
even in the case of a “rick” the word
“pinging” is a poor word for the devil-
ish tremolo of the tumbling bullet.
ADAM LINDSAY GORDON.
(Born October 19, 1833.)
[For The Bulletin.]
Gordon! What memories cluster round the
name,
Moulder of staves that stir and rhymes that
ring!
What need to measure praise or weigh acclaim?
You came and went —nor any other came
To sing as you could sing.
In you the glamor of the past was blent
With all the glory of the plain and glen,
The magic of a new-found continent.
You limned them both in lays and lilts that
went
Straight to the hearts of men.
Art has no boundaries of time or space.
You sang alike of olden chivalry
And new, of court and castle, camp and chase,
Love, life and death, in measures that the race
Will not let lightly die.
A tablet, yours, in storied Westminster,
A niche in high Valhalla for your due!
Yet was no need. The tastes that slight and slur
Old fashions, and the years that blot and blur
Can take no toll of you.
You rest for us where wattle-blossoms wave,
Or under gnarled grey gums—you willed it
thus.
The heritage is ours of all you gave,
Graven, as never upon earthly grave,
A ere perennius.
Though sweeter, subtler singers bring their art
To pipe an hour away, how little endures!
You spoke in words to reach and hold the
heart;
You set your spell on peoples, seas apart;
O bard of “Joyous Garde” and “Britomarte,”
Oh for more songs like yours!
N.S.W.
T. THE R.


“Bridport”: Moses Gabb, M.H.R. for
Angas, is known at Canberra as “the
Quorum King,” for obvious reasons.
But there is no originality in his methods.
Fifty years ago the House of Commons
had a member who was as persistent
and pertinacious as Gabb. His name was
Warton. Various devices were tried to
suppress him, but they all failed, and un-
fortunately he had a safe seat for a
Dorset constituency. Then the Govern-
ment of the day had a brain-wave. War-
ton was a lawyer, of little eminence but
still a lawyer. So he was offered the
Attorney-Generalship of Westralia at
what was then a handsome salary. He
grabbed it and the House of Commons
heaved a great sigh of relief. It proved
a pretty good job for him, for a few
years later Westralia was given re-
sponsible government and Warton, with
other Imperial appointees, returned to
England with a pension.

“1894”: Even these much-execrated
dust-storms have their medicinal quali-
ties. When Broken Hill folk are troubled
with such afflictions as influenza epi-
demics, they always look for a good dust-
storm to give the town a cleansing. It
is noticed, too, that epidemics fade out
after a thorough blow.
* * * *
“Corporal Wanst”: Many of the
ordeals which used to face the British
regular army recruit are being smoothed
away nowadays. One of them is that
backbone of the service the drill cor-
poral with the brazen voice and the blis-
tering vocabulary. The War Office is
having a series of drill and exercise films
taken, and these will presently be issued
to depots so that the recruit can see for
himself exactly how to form fours and
get the strength of other mysteries, in-
cluding the manual exercises and mus-
ketry drill. Presumably the films will be
talkies, so the corporal will not be en-
tirely lost to us, but it is to be feared
that this sort of publicity will cramp a
style which could only blossom to per-
fection in the comparative privacy of a
barrack square.
* * * *
“Flamborough”: Recent references to
those royal “fish” the whale and the
sturgeon draw attention to the fact that
England has suddenly discovered that
big-game fishing of the best is to be ob-
tained in her coastal waters. The quarry
is the tunny, one of the gamest fighters
known and the great attraction of the
much-boomed Catalina resort in South-
ern California. The big fellow—he runs
to 10001 b. and over —follows the herring
shoals and in the season is plentiful in
the North Sea. Scarborough is the H.Q.
of the sport, and this last summer some
"She seems to have a break in her enunciation to-night, Mr. Leader.”
"Say, you keep your eye on your music”
big catches have been recorded. The
tunny is plentiful in our own waters at
times, following the northern migration
of the salmon and other shoal fish. The
mako shark is even more plentiful, and
the Spanish mackerel and swordfishes
also abound. It has taken English fisher-
men a long time to realise they had the
fighting tunny at their front door. How
much longer are our own sportsmen
going to make the long and costly trip to
M.L. for the big-game fishing which
awaits them outside Sydney Heads?
* * * *
“Trey”: That comment on Sydney’s
belated corridor tramcars (B. 18/10/’33)
reminds me that Brisbane, the first of
Australian capitals to run electric-trams,
always favored the corridor car. But
among my fondest memories are the old
Brisbane horse-trams. These had a long
seat up each side, with a passage beween.
Entrance was possible from the rear
platform only. At the other end, con-
trolling the horse-power, sat the man in
charge. Behind him was a box with
a glass front and a slot in the top. On
entering the passenger had to stagger to
the other end of the rocking contraption
and drop a threepenny bit down the slot,
though pennies would do. If any absent-
minded beggar lingered, the engineer in
front would furiously jangle a small bell ;
he would also provide change, but you
had to go to him for it. The fare was
thruppence for any line or any distance,
an American idea which has its good
points. Bundles of tickets could also be
bought at a reduced rate from the man at
the helm.
* * * *
“Mako”: Touching the misleading
effect of the word “please” (B.
18/10/’33), some years ago the M.L.
telegraph authorities requested polite
callers to omit that word when asking
for a number. In nine cases out of ten
the girl at the other end mistook “please”
for “three.”
* * * *
“Tamornie”: The designer of at least
one of Melbourne’s centenary posters
depicts the shade of Batman standing
at a spot east of Prince’s Bridge gazing
at where the State Theatre now stands.
Across the top of the poster is printed,
“This is the place for a village.” But
the spot where tradition credits Batman
with having made that statement is a
mile further west, and is marked with an
insert in the pavement on the north side
of Flinders-street. Batman’s shade is also
shown in the poster as leaning with hands
crossed over the muzzle of a cocked gun,
carelessness of which the pioneer is not
in the least likely to have been guilty.
* * * *
“Mindurup”: “Judges, barristers and
solicitors are the greatest thieves,
scoundrels and perjurers in this country,”
an exasperated ancient with a long-
standing grievance against the courts ot
justice told a Sydney magistrate the other
day preparatory to being fined a shilling
for having made a speech—presumably
to the same effect —in Hyde Park with-
out a permit. Westralia once had a citi-
zen, a woman, who used to say much
the same thing every Sunday on the
Esplanade, or anywhere else where she
could collect an audience. Her griev-
ance concerned a block of land out
of which she asserted that she had
been swindled, and she made her-
self a nightmare to a series of
Attorneys-General. Finally, in sheer
desperation, the Government appointed
a Royal Commission to investigate her
complaint, but it didn’t get her any-
where, partly because the alleged transac-
tion was so remote. After that the lady
included Ministers of the Crown as well
as Judges and lawyers generally in her
fervid philippics, and she made her most
dramatic gesture when she arrived on
“I’m told she’s a very self-sacrificing wife.”
“Well, she’s always giving herself away.”
Fremantle wharf, where an ex-Premier
was being farewelled on his departure
to take over the Agent-General’s job in
London, with an immense streamer an-
nouncing “Good Riddance of Bad Rub-
bish,” which she calmly set up over her
soap-box and proceeded to use as the
text of her sermon. It introduced a
jarring note into the proceedings, par-
ticularly as the departing one was one of
the mildest and most amiable of men,
and after this public sympathy for the
victim of the Law’s alleged villainies
began to wane. But she kept hammer-
ing away at her obsession almost to the
day of her death.
* * * *
“Jakay”: Victoria’s lighthouse popu-
lation numbers 88. The work used to
be to a great extent an hereditary occu-
pation, sons succeeding their fathers, but
since the war preference for returned sol-
diers has brought into the service a new
school of keepers and signallers. The
largest lighthouse community is at Cape
Otway, where there are eight adults
and 21 children. The loneliest is
at Gabo, where a mail arrives once
a month, when weather conditions are
favorable. Here there are six adults
—no children. Cape Everard, Wilson’s
Promontory, Cape Schanck, Cape Nel-
son, Point Lonsdale and Cliffy Island
are the other stations. Children of school
age are either boarded out or educated
by post.

“X.S.”: The Melbourne record for
prior convictions goes to a 13-year-old
resident of Essendon —or, rather, to his
father. Dad has been charged 37 times
with failing to see that his son attended
school.
* * * *
“Oran”: A well-known architect of
the old brigade who died recently used
to delight in telling the story of his first
job. He had submitted plans, specifica-
tions and likewise a tender for a small
backblocks chapel, and sat anxiously out-
side while the elders debated the matter
within. When they called him in to say
all was satisfactory and he could get on
with the good work, his words of thanks
suddenly died in his throat, and he broke
into a cold perspiration. They attributed
his emotion to joy, but a few minutes
later he was feverishly calculating his
meagre resources in his small office.
“For, you see,” he used to conclude with
a chuckle, “I’d forgotten to put a roof
on that chapel.” The roof went on at
his own expense, and though the job
showed no profit it paved the way to
ultimate success.
“Demonax”: “Antom Sulph.’s” par.
about nauseous medicines (B. 18/10/’33)
sends me back to my hospital days,
when, among hundreds of weekly
patients, there would always be “regu-
lars”—little wrong with them, but never
happy unless they were taking medicine.
For such the ideal stuff had to be cheap,
ghastly and harmless. After much ex-
perimenting we standardised a mixture
that went as follows: Tincture of asafce-
tida (which has a smell of rotten eggs,
garlic and dead dog), ammoniated tinc-
ture of valerian, concentrated infusion of
chiretta (the most disagreeably-bitter
drug in the pharmacopoeia) and camphor
water. It worked well for a time, and
then we struck our first and only snag.
Woman, of course. Back she came with
the empty bottle. “I’ve been coming here
for five years now, doctor,” she said,
“and that was the first bottle of medicine
that ever did me any good. I want
another, please.” She got it.
* * * *
“Youngest Inhabitant”: None of early
Sydney’s painted inn-signs—and in Syd-
ney the inns alone boasted swinging sign-
boards —has been preserved, but here and
there may still be seen a piece of statu-
ary which formerly served the purpose
of a sign. One such, a large and spirited
representation of a prancing horse, stands
on the parapet of Nos. 202-204 Pitt-
street, a few doors south of Market-
street. This building was erected in 1890,
and the horse, unnoticed by the crowds
which daily throng the thoroughfare,
locates the site of Cobb and Co.’s office.
Cobb’s coaches have vanished, and so
also have the carriages and traps of the
period, but the prancing horse on Syd-
ney’s skyline remains.

“C.Q.”: The Pope is to be a party
to a Melbourne will case. The estate,
£105,078, belonged to Patrick Lawlor,
a Vic. hotelkeeper, who died in
Rome ; half was left to the Pope and
the rest for the establishment of an R.C.
newspaper. This is not the first time
that his Holiness has been joined in an
action in Melbourne; the late king of
Spain once had a similar experience.

“Jock”: It is just 21 years since the
song “It’s a Long Way to Tipperary”
was published, and curiously enough it
had nothing whatever to do with Ire-
land. The author was Jack Judge, and
the song was first heard at Douglas in
the Isle of Man. Douglas was crowded
with Scots at the time, and they took
the marching song home. Later it was
sung at Lancashire pantomimes, but it
had no vogue in London until the war
came; then Scotch troops passing through
the city brought with them what was
later to become the battle-song of the
Old Contemptibles. The author named
the song after Tipperary Gardens, Old-
bury, Birmingham, where it was com-
posed.

POLITICAL POINTS
“How now, you secret, black and mid-
night grab!”
Things don’t change much. Item from
Haydn’s “Dictionary of Dates”:
Bills greatly facilitating divorce passed by the
Parliaments of N. S. Wales and Vic. vetoed by
the Colonial Office, 1889.
Now they are vetoed by bishops.
McPhee, presenting his pre-election
Budget, reported a deficit of £50,000
and anticipated one of £55,000. It would
be £50,000 more if the Commonwealth
had not come along with an additional
grant. No reduction of taxes is promised
—an unusual thing in a pre-election
Budget; but then McPhee is an unusual
politician.
James, M.H.R., whose nose bears evi-
dence of having been bashed by some
brutal agent of capitalism in early man-
hood, complained to the other tribunes
concerned in the salary grab that he
wasn’t “as well off on my Parliamentary
screw as when I earned seven pounds
a week in a coalmine.” Still, there is no
law to restrain Mr. James from going
back to the mine to hew coal at seven
pounds a week, if he can get it.
Although the Westralian gold yield for
1932 was worth £4,403,600 (“the highest
since 1920,” Collier complacently said)
dividend duty returned only £168,600 —
nearly £lO,OOO less than in 1931-32 and
nearly £109,000 less than in 1930-31. The
cos. are lucky they are not mining in
South Africa. There the central Govern-
ment is taking, by way of excess profits
duty, over 50 per cent, of the gold
premium. Actual profits of the mines
for the current twelvemonth are esti-
mated at £15,500,000 sterling. The Gov-
ernment is grabbing £9,700,000.
Queensland Labor has been nourish-
ing vipers in its bosom. Comrades en-
gaged on Government relief work struck
for higher wages, and Minister Hynes
blames the Communists. He dismissed
the malcontents
and put their
families on weekly
rations, striking
the men off the
list. Now he is
assailed as being
no better than a
capitalist.
ONE OF THE
SEVENTY-
FIVES.
Not the French
field-gun, as will
be seen, but a
Federal Labor
member Mar-
tens, M.H.R. for
Herbert (Q.), who
moved that the
Finance Relief
Bill be committed
so that honorable
members might
vote themselves
another £75 p.a.
In one respect
the artist has
slipped Mr.
Martens is shown
with his hands in
his own pockets.
Bruce, who secured his last conversions
at the lowest interest rate tacked to an
Australian loan for 20 years—3| p.c.—
is negotiating for some more ; and there
is plenty of scope. N.S.W. and Victoria
between them have £9,850,000-odd in
per cents, to be dealt with, and
there is £24,500,000 worth of 5 per
cents, on the waiting list. On the
£71,563,000 of loans already converted,
£1,600,000 p.a. is being saved in interest
and exchange, and the next two batches
should slice off about £650,000 more.
Bruce has certainly been worth his salary.
ANOTHER SEVENTY-FIVE.
Corser, Country-party member for Wide
Bay. Mr. Corser is sure that “the
public will not begrudge the
£lO,OOO involved.”
After all, it looks as if some kind of
gas legislation will be passed this cen-
tury in Vic. The bill to substitute a
calorific for an illuminant standard has
been shoved most of the way through
committee in Vic. Assembly. By keep-
ing the House five hours later than usual
on the last sitting day of the week Chief
Sec. Macfarlan broke down a stonewall.
Knowing he had the numbers, Mac let
division after division be taken, giving
way only dh trifles to humor the Oppo-
sition, or to show that he wasn’t too
stiffnecked on the point that 500 British
thermal units was a magical figure.
There are many optimists among the
126 gentlemen who have nominated for
the N.S.W. Leg. Council elections. There
are 65 U.A.Ps., 38 Langsters, 12 Federal
Labs, and 11 Independents ; and only 60
seats. Among Councillors of the old
regime, 23 did not seek renomination,
and the State will lose the services of
James Ashton, James Murdoch, T. S.
Gordon and some other useful men,
though more than half those who retire
are old. Newcomers include E. M.
Mitchell, Richard Windeyer, Dr. Mac-
guire and Graham Waddell. The election
will be highly complicated, but it is ex-
pected that the new House will be a
smaller reflection of the old one.
Queensland Parliamentarians mused in
wistful silence when interviewed about
the Canberra grab. For some time a
strong combined party has been in favor
of bringing back the Brisbane screw to
the old figure of £750, at which the
McCormacks fixed it in 1926. Moore
cut it to £5OO, amid general lamentations,
except from the taxpayers. However,
members tempered the wind to them-
selves when the Financial Emergency Act
came along. They unanimously decided
that the provisions of that measure should
not apply to them.
Attorney-General Jeffries is putting
through the S.A. Assembly a bill of 153
clauses which is calculated to make the
way of the legal transgressor hard. The
Law Society is to be given statutory
power to strike off defaulting members
or to send them to the Supreme Court
to be struck off. Every practitioner must
annually produce a return to the
Supreme Court, backed by a bank certi-
ficate, showing that his trust funds are
intact. A levy to constitute a fidelity
fund is provided for, and agreements as
to costs are placed on a common-law
basis, except that they must not vary
according to success or failure and the
Supreme Court’s taxing powers are not
invalidated.
Advocates for Riverina separation
suffered a rude shock when they met
Stevens’s Commissioner to discuss the
matter last week. It appears that the
Government side has some evidence to
offer which the Riverinos believe will
take about four years to produce. Mut-
tering that Charlie Kelleway is not the
only stonewaller which Australia has pro-
duced, the cockies asked for an ad-
journment to consider their position.
Queensland Labor is again toying with
the question of licensing betting shops.
The proposal was turned down last year
by Cabinet, but O’Keefe, the member for
Cairns, has returned to the charge. In
some towns every other shop is a gam-
bling joint, and O’Keefe considers that
the State might as well get something
for itself instead of looking on com-
placently. Some Opposition members are
of the same opinion.
Vic. Premier Argyle has told the Cocky
party that he is preparing legislation to
empower company and private trustees
to enter into binding agreements to give
interest concessions to mortgagors or to
write off part of the principal; but his
Government will not associate itself
with compulsory reduction of principal
without the mortgagee’s consent. As for
bulk-handling, he is not enthusiastic, but
will risk £200,000 (loan money, of course)
for a start. Disappointment was ex-
pressed by Wettenhall, one of the few
Agrarians in the House at the time, that
the rehabilitation legislation was only
“under consideration,” and Bussau
started to growl on an adjournment
rftotion. Argyle proposes to keep Par-
liament’s nose to the grindstone between
now and Christmas.
ALSO A SEVENTY-FIVE.
James, Lang-Labor member for the
Hunter ( N.S.W. ). Mr. James’s party
announces that its seventy-fives will
be paid into “a trust fund" and used
for election expenses.
Queensland public servants who are
not members of trade-unions have been
threatened by more than one Labor Gov-
ernment. Forgan Smith is brandishing
the sjambok again. Commissioner Story
has been ordered to draw up a list of civil
servants who are members of unions,
and those whose names are not on it are,
it is announced, to be dealt with as the
Government may decide. But the Gov-
ernment had better go easy. The Com-
monwealth Constitution says (section
116): —
No religious test shall be required as a
qualification for any office of public trust
And it is questionable whether the
Queensland Constitution allows any poli-
tical test. That is what it would amount
to, the public-service unions being part
and parcel of the Labor party.
NOT A SEVENTY-FIVE.
Gabb, the Independent member for
Angas (S.A), who told the House
what he thought of the business ; and
what the people think. Gabb also
voted against the 1920 steal.
A building firm has offered Forgan
Smith a plan for giving Queensland
workers a chance to buy homes without
paying a deposit. The sponsors have
arranged with financiers to lend £230,000
carrying 3J p.c., issued at £97, money to
be lodged with the Public Trustee and
made available as houses are built. On
completion the dwellings are to be taken
over by the Government, which will then
call for applications from would-be
buyers. Cost to the Government would
be about £550 a house, and occupants
would have the right to pay off the loans
in 25 years at 15s. per week, inclusive of
rates and taxes. The Bureau of Indus-
try probably will investigate.
A. S. Henry, whose Divorce Bill incor-
porating features of the Maoriland law
was flattened out in N.S.W. Assembly,
is about the most serious-minded man in
the House. Among those who voted his
measure down in the name of morality
were hedonists who never miss a pony
meeting. It recalls a story told at the
time of the Bradlaugh affair. Two
women called at the House of Commons
intent on seeing Bradlaugh, who has been
called the saint of secularism. They
asked for the member for Northampton.
There were two members for Northamp-
ton, the other being Labouchere, who

ITEMS
A. H. Hudson, dead in Brisbane at
85, was the oldest member of its Stock
Exchange. He began his career as a
banker, and after some years spent at
Gympie during the early gold rush days
he came to Brisbane to manage the local
branch of the Commercial. He was
an original member of the first Queens-
land golf club.
J. V. Fairbairh’s selection by the
U.A.P. to contest Flinders is a continu-
ance of the Bruce tradition. He is about
the same age as Bruce was when Bruce
entered the House, and while S.M.B.
was captain of Melbourne Grammar
School, J.V.F. in his day was classical
dux of Geelong Grammar. Bruce was a
J V. FAIRBAIRN, M.L.A. (Vic.), who
has resigned his Warrnambool seat to
contest Flinders .
Cambridge rowing Blue ; Fairbairn rowed
for his school and was tennis cham-
pion. Bruce was wounded at the front;
Fairbairn joined the Royal Air Force in
his teens, was shot down over the Ger-
man lines and taken prisoner and had 20
major operations in four years. He was
left with sufficient energy to become a
very active grazier and to fight his way
into the Victorian Assembly—he beat
Bailey, Minister for Lands in one of
the most strenuous election contests the
southern State has known in half a cen-
tury. He used his own aeroplane to cover
the electorate from end to end. Last
year he spent a few months studying
marketing problems in England. The
polling date has been set down for
Armistice Day. The C.P. will not contest
the seat and the Labor candidate, Dr.
Haywood, will need very good luck to
get in.
Charles Atkinson, Litt.D., who gets the
headship of Methodist Ladies’ College in
Adelaide (where a male head is a new
idea), started in small churches on the
Tas. west coast, and later took brilliant
degrees in philosophy at Melbourne,
where also he was acting-head of M.L.C.
for a time, after Fitchett and before
Grove.
The new president of S.A. Royal
Society is J. M. Black, a Scotchman of
78. He was a newspaperman in Adel-
aide till the end of the century, and has
since made himself one of Australia’s
leading botanists, with a Verco medal
and a Von Muller medal to his credit.
Black is connected by marriage with
D’Oyly Carte, of Gilbert and Sullivan
fame.
Terata Mahuta te Wherowhero, the
fourth of a line of Maori kings which
was set up in 1858, is dead. He was
born at Hikurangi in 1880, and on the
death of his father, who was a member
of the Legislative Council, was pro-
claimed king of the Waikato Maoris. In
1906 he married a chieftainess of the
Ngatikoroki tribe, named Te Uranga,
and in 1914 he visited England, being
received by the King and Queen.
Mrs. F. B. Delaney, wife of the owner
of the Double Chance goldmine at Bata-
via River, Cape York, is down on
a flying visit to her home town —“flying,”
literally, as she went by ’plane from
Batavia to Cairns to pick up the mail
train for Brisbane. Mrs. Delaney looks
forward to some draughts of pure water
—the mineral-charged stuff which they
get at Batavia River blistering and tor-
turing the skins of those unfortunate
enough to have to drink it.
F. J. Cato, successor to Alexander
Peacock as chairman of the Melbourne
board of the London and Lancashire
Insurance Co., has packed a lot of work
into his 75 years of life. Originally a
M. school-teacher —though Victorian-
born —he returned to Australia in 1881
to enter the retail grocery business with
T. E. Moran. When the latter died in
1890 the business had 34 branches ; it
now has 152. F.J.C. is president of
Queen’s College, Melbourne University.
Had an 85th birthday in Adelaide.
Langdon Bonython, sole proprietor till
1929 of the “Advertiser” —he still
attends the office daily. He is a sort of
perpetual president—44 years to date —of
S.A. School of Mines ; and has given the
University £20,000 to endow the “chair”
of Law, and £45,000 for a Great Hall
now being erected. He was in the first
and second Commonwealth Parliaments
But he is still a keen Cornishman, and
the Royal Institution in that county has
taken the unusual step of making this
overseas stalwart its president.
J. H. Prowse has sat in the Common-
wealth Parliament since 1919. He is a
N. S. Welshman, born at Adelong, and
before entering politics was for 25 years
with United Insurance. He is a useful
man on committees, and was a member
of the 1923 Royal Commission on the
effects of the Navigation Act on industry.
Prowse served the Bruce-Page Govern-
ment for a time as Whip, and for another
short space was Deputy-Chairman of
Committees in the Reps. Once he was
J. H. PROWSE, one of the
opponents of the salary grab.
Mayor of Perth for a couple of years,
and after the war acted as chairman of
the Discharged Soldiers’ Land Settle-
ment Board. He is one of the few mem-
bers of the Reps, opposing the salary
increase.
Arthur Rae, of the close-cropped head
and furrowed brow, looks the fighter he
is. He is one of the pioneer Labor men
who refuse to grow politically old-
fashioned. Every new movement finds
him waving the red flag in the van. He
was a foundation member of the A.W.U.,
one of the first N. S. Wales Labor
Ms.L.A., sitting for Murrumbidgee from
Senator ARTHUR RAE, one of Labor’s
earliest Ms.P.
1891-94 after having been sentenced to
61 cumulative fortnights’ imprisonment
in 1890 for bringing the shearers out on
strike and refusing to pay fines. The
Government released him after a month
and the A.W.U. made him a life mem-
ber. Rae has held all the main offices
in the union from president downwards,
but after a burst of redness in 1920 he
was excluded from membership. Twice
he has sat in the Senate—once before
the war and since 1928. Three of his
sons served in the Great War and two
were killed. Hjs recreations are appro-
priate to a worker’s advocate —axe work,
quarrying and mountain-climbing. He
is 73, and a Maorilander.
R. Mcßae Stewart, secretary to the
Department of Agriculture (Vic.), dead
at 61, spent his life in the service of the
Lands, as-did his father, who was land
officer in Beechworth for generations.
The son in Horsham in the pioneering
days found that his lack of knowledge of
the language militated against his success
in dealing with German settlers. By
constant study and practice he became a
good German linguist, and was called in
to settle all sorts of disputes connected
with his department.
When the industrial history of Aus-
tralia is written E. Eugene Rogers, who
returned to his home at Harrisville, near
Pittsburg (U.S.A.), recently, should not
be forgotten. He specialises in the instal-
lation and operation of steel-plate mills,
having supervised their introduction,
among other places, in India and, more
recently, in Australia. Twelve months
ago he installed a plant at Port Kembla
for the A. I. and S. This is the only
plate mill in this country, and an export
trade in plates with M.L. is growing.
Captain Bede Clifford, Governor of
the Bahama Islands, who was knighted
last June, is a Melbourne man with a
fine military record. He was military
secretary to Australia’s Governor-Gen-
eral from 1919 to 1921, after serving in
the war with the Royal Fusiliers. Later
he was appointed military secretary to
the Governor-General of South Africa
and Imperial secretary to the South
African High Commissioner. He is the
third son of the 10th Baron Clifford of
Chudleigh, who lived in Tasmania for
many years, and a cousin of Sir Hugh
Clifford, a prominent member of the
Colonial Service. Bede is the first old
boy of Xavier College (Melbourne) to
receive a knighthood.
Harry Lawson, who becomes one of
Lyons’s Honorary Ministers in the
Senate, has been 34 years in politics,
which he entered by defeating James
Whiteside McCay at a by-election in
Castlemaine. He first held Ministerial
office in 1913, and was Premier of Vic-
toria for more years in one piece than
anybody in history—from 1918 to 1924.
He left the Victorian House in 1928
after having been defeated for the
Speakership. The junior position in the
Ministry which he has accepted might
be a step to greater things, for he is
very popular with the Country party,
which would be more inclined to agree
with him as a leader of the U.A.P. than
with anyone else in the Lyons team.
Lawson is a son of the manse.
The report that Right Rev. John
Walker’s term at Canberra will end on
December 31 means that his ambition to
celebrate the first service in the Canberra
Presbyterian Cathedral will never be
realised. The veteran minister suggested
to a wealthy co-religionist that he might
bequeath £5OOO to the Canberra church.
The rich worshipper agreed, but on the
day he was to see his solicitor he took
ill, and he died without arranging for
the bequest. Dr. Walker has been five
years in Canberra as commissioner, but
it now seems likely that only one minis-
ter will be appointed to look after the
place. His present assistant is the Rev.
Dr. Munro Ford, a noted scholar and
cleric.
T. H. Easterfield, of the pleasant smile,
shown herewith, was grounded at two
Yorkshire schools, was a foundation
scholar at Clare College, Cambridge, and
studied at the Zurich Politechnikum and
the University of Wurzburg, of which he
is a Ph.D. His subject is chemistry, and
having pursued it from a junior demon-
strator’s bench at Cambridge to a pro-
Professor T. H. EAST ERF I ELD, retiring
Director of the Cawthron Institute, M.L.
fessorship at Victoria University College,
Canterbury (M.L.), he became Direc-
tor of the famous Cawthron Institute at
Nelson in 1919. As his picture shows, the
work agrees with him.
J. P. McGlinn, who succeeds Lockyer
as chairman of the A.I.F. canteen fund,
is an old postal employee who drifted
from the State into the Commonwealth
service at Federation, and immediately
hurried off to the South African War,
from which he emerged with the
Queen’s medal and six clasps. The
Great War earned him the C.B.E. and
C.M.G. A few years after his return
from the front he became a Common-
wealth Public Service Commissioner,
but retired from the job in 1930. He
is 64.

Most of the extra £123,396 of profit was
won during the last two months of the
term; heavy sales of lead were then
made by the smelters at Port Piric. and
the average London spot price of the
metal rose from £lO 19s. lid. for April
to £l3 10s. 3d. for June. Other helpful
factors were still lower mining and treat-
ment costs, lighter returning charges,
bigger tonnage, richer ore and better
recoveries of silver and zinc.
The board put the net return from
mining at £154,767, as against £10,370,
a loss of £65,422 and a profit of £175,062
for the three preceding years. The spring
in sales plus products on hand (£760,581).
was £139,924; exes. (£605,814, including
£33,000 for depreciation) were pulled
back £4473. The co.’s £1,021,463 of in-
vestments (they include £674,893 of scrip
in associated enterprises and £220,450 of
deposits) netted £85,906, or £20,949 less
than for the previous term. The profit
claimed from all sources was thus
£123,448 better at £240,673, of which
approximately one half was distributed
(the div. was lifted 5 p.c., making 15
p.c. for the year), and the other half,
together with the allowance for depre-
ciation, etc. (it is included with profits
in the table), lifted the book value of the
lay-by to £1,834,601 at June 30. That
excludes the workers’ compensation
fund, £63,005.
Here are surplus assets looked at from
another angle:

Liabilities.. .. 200,405 103,352 104,192
Excess assets .. £890,792 £1,303,698 £1,440,452
Over the last decade the excess has in-
creased from 225. 3d. to 365. per share,
and much of the gain has been invested
in associated enterprises to the benefit of
the industry generally. Of the 365., shares
in other cos. account for 16s. lid. Plant
figures at £1,173,463, up £16,388, due
largely to expenditure on the new shaft,
through which all ore has been hauled
since Oct. 3, 1932 —it was put down to
cheapen extraction of crudes from the
deep levels at the southern end of the
mine. The mine appears at £83,694 ; it
includes 3,500,000 tons of blocked ore,
and a lot more high-grade stone is
known to exist between the 1170 ft. and
1370 ft. levels. ,
An extra 25,022 tons of crudes was
raised at an average of 4s. 4.3 d. per ton

The marked improvement in percentage
recoveries over the last eight years has
helped earnings and reduced costs, which
can be expected to further benefit from
installation of a new flotation plant. The
figures do not include recoveries from
the deleaded residues, or the lead in the
zinc concentrates or the zinc in the lead
concentrates.
The 28,160 tons of lead in stock at
June 30 was taken into account at £l2
10s. a ton, Australian currency. Much
of it was sold during July and August,
when the London quote was £l3 10s. 3d.
(= £AI6 17s. lOd.) and £l2 6s. sd.
(= £AIS Bs.) respectively; last week-end
the figure was £ll 13s. 96. (= £AI4
12s. 2d.).
At 645. 6d. the pound shares show an
immediate return of 4.6 p.c. on a 3s. div.
basis, or 6.2 p.c. on a 4s. distribution.

J. C. Dennys founded the business oyer
70 years ago to handle west Victorian
wools. For the 16 years after the public
became interested in 1912 it was a steady
7 percenter. However, shortly before the
boom burst the co. plunged into pastoral-
finance and other activities, borrowing
heavily for the purpose ; and visible re-
serves were shallow —£19,113 in excess
of goodwill (£60,000) at June 30. The
reduction of commission earnings and
other troubles which accompanied slump
brought a loss of £4099 in 1931, and
shareholders were passed by for the first
time. Low prices and the need to pro-
vide for contingencies have since kept
both profits and divs. down, though the
business has continued to expand.
During the last term the co. put an
extra 7710 bales (64,145) under the
hammer; the lot fetched £778,896, or
£74,980 more than in the previous year.
But handling charges were reduced, and
results in the grain and station produce
sections were disappointing ; the drop in
the gross value of land sales (£156,232)
was £38,963, and in the sale of livestock
(£449,986) £40,507, notwithstanding that
more animals were sold. Gross profit
(£71,561) was £1490 better; exes.
(£66,376) took all but £329 of the in-
crease, leaving the net result at 1.7 p.c.

Owing to the addition of £4412 net to
fixed assets, the more or less liquid sur-
plus (£170,430) was £1314 lighter than
at the previous balance. The whole posi-
tion hinges upon the ability of debtors
to meet their commitments ; in this re-
spect the rise in prices and recent rains
have brightened the outlook. Still, earn-
ings are likely to remain very sensitive
to seasonal and market fluctuations.

•Reserves subject to undisclosed establishment exes.
The co., in which the Commonwealth
Government holds a controlling interest,
has done a lot for Australia, despite
mulish opposition. The postal authori-
ties opposed establishment of direct
Beam communication between Australia
and England ; yet this service (it is the
backbone of the co.’s business) has saved
the people who used it £BOO,OOO or
more since it was opened in 1927.
The department wants to take control
of the business out of the hands of the
co., and has stood in the way of a re-
newal of cheap week-end wireless facili-
ties between Australia, Britain and Ire-
land ; certainly a lot of money has been
invested in marine cables, but, so far as
Australia is concerned, more has been
invested in this wireless co.
During the last term the Beam traffic
and the co.’s output of broadcast re-
ceivers both increased; so did use of
the wireless telephone, which has put
Australia within speaking distance of the
rest of the world. Also, ships in England
and elsewhere were fitted with the co.’s
Australian-made equipment, contracts for
erection of three broadcasting stations in
Maoriland were secured, and a subsidiary
was formed to manufacture wireless
valves. Gross earnings (£476,015) sprang
£10,893 ; exes. (£393,843) took £5BBO of
the increase, leaving the net result at 11
p.c. on capital as against 10.3, 7.9, 11.3,
10.6 and 6.4 p.c. back to 1928. That
was after adding £35,608 net to the re-
serve against patents, etc- (£255,108). In-
tangibles total £142,067, including
£49,067 capitalised in connection with
research, etc., in the Beam'section. Thediv.
was lifted half a point, making it 8 p.c.

Notwithstanding the year’s addition of
£50,007 to the book value of fixed assets,
the more or less liquid surplus (£162,573)
was £8241 stronger than at the previous
balance. The cash holding was £221,094,
up £14,357.
How the current term will pan out it
is difficult to say. The agreement with
the Government, whereby the co. made
its patents free to the public for five
years, receiving in return 3s. of each list-
ener’s license fee, runs out in Dec., and
is not to be renewed. The number of
licenses now in existence is in the neigh-
borhood of half a million. Though
royalties may amount to as much as or
more than the Government moiety, the
difficulty in the past has been to collect
them.
The market, however, notes the mar-
gin between last year’s earnings and dis-
tribution, the comfortable state of the
finances and the growth of the business,
and prices the fully-paid pound shares at
345. The return at that figure is 4.7 p.c.
on an 8 p.c. div. basis.

It’s the old story of writing up paid
capital to represent “the real value of
the assets.” The reconstruction in 1919
made an 8 p.c. div. in the following term
worth almost double that to old holders.
In 1924 goodwill was given a book value
of £180,324, and, together with most of
the tangibles, was passed to a subsidiary
for £270,000 in scrip. The parent there-
upon scattered five new shares for every
two old ones, making paid capital
£300,540 ; later it advanced to £348,558
by cash issues.
With the change in outlook this co.,
Victor Electric Plaster and Peninsular
Plaster (they all worked deposits at the
southern end of York Peninsula, S. Aus.)
sold their fixed assets and stocks to a
new operating concern, Australian Gyp-
sum Products Pty., as from July 1, 1930.
The £200,000 of scrip received by Aus-
tralian Gypsum, Ltd., replaced its shares
in and advances to the subsidiary, the
book value of the loss on the deal being
£191,174. At June 30 the co.’s other
assets were freehold, £1000; debtors,
£6477. There was £8770 coming to credi-
tors.
The year’s £5093 of profit was equal
to 1.4 p.c. on capital. The money is to
be used mostly in paying off £3887 of
debentures, plus interest. Shareholders’
prospects depend partly upon the extent
to which the operating co. can further
liven its output. Only the Melbourne
plant was in operation during the last
term. Certainly there has been a slight
revival in the building and cement indus-
tries, and the co.’s business has been ex-
tended to Maoriland and Queensland;
but competition remains keen, and that
means narrow margins. Production of
gypsum in S. Aus. was 34,383 tons, 1921 ;
95,613 tons, 1929; 24,207 tons, 1931;
44,962 tons, 1932.
Over the last six months the market
has lengthened its bid for the pound
shares from 3s. 3d. to 6s. 6d. The return
at the higher figure would be 6.1 p.c.
on a 2 p.c. div. basis, and a 2 p.c. div.
would call for £6971 on capital as it now
stands. Subject to goodwill, etc., in the
operating co., the net tangible cover is
11s. sd. per share. In the circumstances
no harm would be done if the difference,
plus a bit more for good measure, was
written off.

LOCATION.- The Mine is situated on the main North Coast Highway, five miles from Urunga, a
seaport on the North Coast Railway, which passes within half a mile of the mine, which is ideally situated
for the building of any necessary siding.
• A detailed inventory of the Plant and Machinery and information regarding the history of the mine
is available at the office of the Liquidators. An inspection of the assets by interested tenderers may
be arranged by appointment.
Our representative informs us that the Buildings, Plant and Machinery are in good condition and,
subject to minor adjustments, ready for immediate productive purposes, and an excellent opportunity
is offered to anyone desirous of acquiring a commercial proposition for the production of arsenic on a
profitable basis. The mine has a great potential value as a gold producer, as assays have shown as
much as loz. to the ton. An experienced mining man has set down the developed ore as approximately
2000 tons, with large bodies to be developed by sinking and driving.
Tenders may be made for the above assets in one lot or for the different lots separately or conjointly.
Tenders must be accompanied by 10% cash deposit. The highest or anv tender not necessarily accepted.

The profit was then enough to pay the
pref. divs. (now 1\ p.c., owing to the
statutory cut), double the distribution to
the ords., making it 3 p.c., and put £759
in the cupboard. That was after £14,436

The year’s growth of £26,387 in debtors’
balances suggests that trade improved.
The spring in the more or less liquid
surplus (£173,444, including stocks) was
£17,959. Plant is the item which catches
the eye. It means brisk turnover if
satisfactory profits are to be won, not-
withstanding the specific reserves already
referred to.
Stedmans began manufacturing sweets
in the ’fifties of last century or there-
abouts ; Hendersons linked up much
later. There was a reconstruction in
1920, when paid capital became
£530,630 ; just before the war the com-
bined capital of the two separate con-
cerns was about one-tenth of that figure.
Meanwhile, the small business of Dillon,
Burrows and Co. was bought and
Nestle’s became interested, thus ensur-
ing a wider distribution of Stedman-
Henderson’s products. Still, it was not
until 1925 that the ords. got a long-
delayed taste, thanks to the success of
Minties. Before that the business was
not robust; hence the high price paid
for the pref. capital got in during 1920-
23. The extension of the business to
Maoriland, the general turn of the tide,
reduction of exes, and the cut in the
price of sugar have helped greatly over
the last couple of years.
Only the prefs. (there are 50,000 firsts
and a like number of seconds) used to be
listed. At 275. 6d. they return 5.6 p.c.
on a 1\ p.c. div. basis. Excluding specific
reserves, the net tangible cover is £l2
7s. 3d. firsts, £ll 7s. 3d. seconds and
19s. 6d. ords. The ords. were listed for
the first time on Monday last. At 14s.
they would return 4.4 p.c. on a 3 p.c. div.
basis.
Queensland’s gold yield for the first
nine months of 1933 was 64,002 fine
ounces, valued at £271,887, an increase
of 55,021 fine ounces and £233,738
respectively compared with the corres-
ponding period of 1932. Mount Coolon
and Mount Morgan are still the largest
producers, but during the last few months
the richest stone has come from the Clon-
curry district, the estimated value per ton
being £2O 16s. Bd. There is a lot of
activity at the diggings south-east of
Cloncurry.
* * * *
A syndicate has been formed to treat
the bed of the old Mt. Morgan Co.’s dam,
near where the first 10-head battery was
erected. It is believed that the bottom of
the dam contains a lot of fine gold, and
an electrically-driven centrifugal sand-
pump is being installed.
* * * *
Of all Queensland’s major goldfields
Croydon has not reacted to the high
price of the metal; indeed, for some
years has ceased to exist as a mining
centre. Still, it will quicken pulses to know
that A. J. Jones and Byrnes have taken
up leases on the Tabletop field, and that
C. G. Gibson will later advise. This
personnel means that big interests are
casting their eyes Croydonwards. Former
returns from Tabletop reefs averaged
lOdwt., without anything extra fine in
the way of crushing.
* * * *
During September the Golden Mile Co.,
Cracow (Q.), put through 358 i tons for
approximately 3900 z. of gold. But assays
from the stopes above the 100 ft. level
on the Warrego lease average less than
lOdwt.; on the South Arm, where the
shaft is down 102 ft. from the brace, the
trenches south of the shaft show about
15dwt.
* * * *
Hawkwood Gold (Q.) has not met with
the success that it anticipated; values
considered promising on the surface have
become unpayable at shallow depth.
However, it is claimed that there is not
less than 850 tons of l|oz. to 340 z.
stone (150 tons of it is at grass) on the
co.’s Narayen lease. The management
is now considering the most economical
method of treating this.
* * * *
A three-head Government battery has
been set up on the Sunnyside goldfield,
Mackay (N.Q.), where gold was dis-
covered about 12 months ago. The best
crushing to date has come from Storey
and Wilson’s show, which put through
four tons of picked stuff at the Towers
for 40oz. Assays at the Little Maid
also show high values. Prospectors at
Mount Britten, Alligator Creek and
Eungella have won some 200 oz. over the
last 12 months.
* * * *
During the war Mark Eves, an old
Cloncurry prospector, discovered one of
the richest cobalt lodes in the Common-
wealth near Mt. Elliott. He sold out to
a co., which produced handsomely for
some years. Now he is back on to the
old lode again, and from a 35ft. shaft
has taken out 12 tons of ore, containing
2} tons of cobalt, worth £460, or nearly
£4O a ton of ore. This is better than
most gold prospects, and it shows that
there is a worth-while market for a few
other metals.
* * * *
More tin has been bought during 1933
in the Herberton (N.Q.) district than for
years past. Last year buyers complained
of stagnation ; business is so good now
that Lempriere’s have sent up Arthur
Reid to consolidate their moiety of the
mild revival in the trade. The rise in the
price of the metal, due largely to the
international restriction scheme and
renewed American buying, has enabled
a lot of low-grade Irvinebank ore to be
handle(J. The stamps there have just
treated a run of 150 tons —almost an un-
heard of quantity since the days of the
Vulcan and old John Moffatt. John
Moffatt and J. H. Reid, of Tenterfield,
did well out of Irvinebank, but the town
is now only a ghost of the old mining
camp of the ’nineties, when 3000 inhabi-
tants were packed in the narrow ravines.
The Canberra and Cornishmen are mak-
ing business for the buyers, and the Wild
Irishman, once the pride of Herberton
hills, has figured again in a small way.

The Bird-in-Hand, Two-in-the-Bush
and Ridge mines in the Adelaide hills
(S.A.) are shortly to be unwatered and
developed. The Woodside group, which
produced nearly 20,0000 z. of gold thirty
or forty years ago, Shut down on ac-
count of a heavy influx of water. That
was after the Bird-in-Hand had crushed
4453 tons from the 375 ft. (lowest) level
for an average of 13dwt. sgr. over the
plates, with 4dwt. in the sands. Installa-
tion of an electrically-driven pump
(capacity, 33,000 gallons an hour) is ex-
pected to overcome the water trouble.
According to late John Warren and Joel
Phillips, of Broken Hill, the main lode
varies from sft. to Bft. in width; the
Government Geologist reported “there
was not the slightest doubt of per-
manency—they [the lodes] ought to be
worked profitably down to 2000 ft.”
B.H. Prop, is tipped to exercise its
option (the price is £30,000-odd) over
the Enterprise, Kalgoorlie (W.A.). Re-
cent bore-hole strikes, backed by develop-
ments in drives and crosscuts, have en-
hanced the possibilities of the property
at depth. The principal block is the old
Boulder No. 1, which the Boulder No. 1
Co. abandoned after years of unsatis-
factory operations. Then tributors
stepped in, and did well for a while ;
later a local syndicate took a hand, and
the alert Ernest Williams bought a quar-
ter interest in the venture for Boulder
Perseverance. Incidentally, this co. also
purchased and, so far as The Bulletin
knows, still owns the old Bank of Eng-
land block on the east side of the Mile.
In the early days a London co. snapped
up this bank area on the strength of a
rich patch of oxidised ore, peppered with
mustard gold ; but the shoot petered out.
The show was worked by others in a
small way before Perseverance got it.

Some Adelaide and other option-
seekers are investigating Edjudina’s gold
deposits (W.A.). The field, 100 miles
north-east of Kalgoorlie, was discovered
in the early ’nineties; it is remarkable
for its length and the comparative nar-
rowness of its formations. The now-
defunct Gt. Fingall began there. After
buying a costly milling plant in England
and paying £7OOO cartage from Albany
to the field, the co. quitted, leaving the
plant. Subsequently some working
miners crushed the dumps, and got 2oz.
returns. Later still, a number of small
syndicates met with success, but none
was financially strong enough to carry on
below water-level. Recently Herman
Mandelstam has pottered about there.

The north drive on the 1200 ft. level

with North Kalgurli, has been stripped
for 72ft., values over a width of 12ft.
averaging 7dwt. During the last few
months developments on this level have
raised doubts as to the correctness of
the theory that gold-bearing ore is not
likely to be found in calc schist. South

adjoining lease, the New Croesus, from
which 58 tons recently averaged loz.

Princess Royal (W.A.) is quietly look-
ing for another mine. Indications are
that the shoot in its small Westonia show
is cutting out in the granite; at most
only a few thousand tons of ore is
likely to be extracted before the end
comes. The co.’s engineer is sizing up
the prospects of the old refractory Cal-
lion, at Davyhurst, and, if it is half as
good as the vendors reckon it is, the
Royal may make an offer. The co. has
plant and sufficient cash to tackle a ven-
ture of this kind.

Western Mining Corp. has taken a 15
months’ option over the Phoenix, Norse-
man (W.A.). The purchase price is
£28,687, plus 95,625 fully-paid 10s. shares
in any co. formed to work the property.
The vendor is to have the right to sub-
scribe for 50,000 contribs. and to under-
write on the same terms as other under-
writers one-fifth of the shares in the new
co.

On Kimberley Oil Options’ property
at Patricia, 125 miles north-east of Kal-
goorlie, the drive north from No. 3 shaft
is opening up well; it is now about 60ft.
in with 30dwt. ore exposed over the full
face. A new reef has also been
located 160 ft. north of the shaft; where,
opened up, over 6ft. of 16dwt. ore was
visible. There is 260 tons at grass, in-
cluding tributors’ ore.

New Venture Gold will shortly put
through a series of trial crushings from
the 20ft.-wide lode on the Brilliant, Cool-
gardie (W.A.). An average of about
Bdwt. is anticipated. The co. has also
secured a long line of country south of
Bayley’s United and King’s Cross, Cool-
gardie, and holds options over the Sadie
and Turn of the Tide, Kunanalling, some
miles to the north.

Salvation Syndicate’s leases, Grant’s
Patch (W.A.), under option to Great
Boulder Prop., have returned 2920 z. over
the plates from 201 tons, with Bdwt. in
the sands. Thus far the best stone has
been met with at a depth of 150 ft., and
the last five crushings have been consis-
tently good ; the property may attract
outside capital.

E.D.: The future of Australian Glass, British

SHADOW SHOWS.
“Little Giant,” at the Regent, earned
the rare tribute of a round of clapping at
the finish on Saturday night. It is a
comic gangster, a medium in which
Hollywood always does good work.
Edward Robinson, retired bootlegger,
is taken up by the aristos of California
on the strength of his money. It is
understandable. He and his offsider,
Russell Hopton, can’t play polo, but in
other respects they are indistinguishable
from their new friends. Edward becomes
infatuated with a girl (Helen Vinson)
whose father tries to swindle him. Not
till he has bought the father’s business
does he discover that it is bankrupt. He
telephones to Chicago, and his supporters
are seen arriving in a large ’plane, zeal-
ously oiling their machine-guns en route.
But the faithful fellows are not
called on to take human life. The swindler
is persuaded to return his ill-gotten gains
by the suave application of burning cigar-
ends to the soles of his feet, leaving
honesty, in the person of Mr. Robinson,
triumphant and in a position to marry
Mary Astor. The laughs are loud and
long.
Mr. Robinson (pointing proudly to one of
his modernist pictures): “Ever see anything
like that?”
Mr. Hopton: “Not since I went off the
cocaine.”
Homely sallies of that kind go down
better with Sydney movie audiences than
Lonsdale’s brightest efforts.
As a picture of life in the ’nineties
“She Done Him Wrong” is a failure ;
a remark which applies to nearly all
screen attempts to re-create this interest-
ing period. “Old English” is the only
complete success that the writer has seen.
Mae West, in her clothes, walk and
mannerisms, is an exotic of 35 years ago
to the life. Her New York flat, with
its awful bed and decorations, is not an
unfair commentary on the taste of her
day and class. But she sings jazz, which
was unknown in the ’nineties ; her ser-
vant wears the latest thing in Hollywood
maid’s caps ; and she drives about with
a coachman, footman and pair of car-
riage-horses (without bearing-reins) in a
shabby light victoria or one-horse shay.
Perhaps six of the characters dress and
behave in period (the artist who sings
“Silver Threads Among the Gold” is by
far the best of them), but the others are
moderns. The hero puts the lid on it,
in a manner of speaking, by appearing
in the last sequence in a 1933 hat, collar
and suit!
The basic theme —tragedies occurring
behind the scenes while gaiety reigns in
front of the house —has been done to
death in backstagers of yesteryear ; and
the idea of the beautiful police boy fall-
ing romantically in love with the hard-
faced malefactor whom Miss West por-
trays is idiotic.

“Turn Back the Clock,” at Sydney
Capitol, is an echo of “Cavalcade.”
Coward’s moral is adopted—it doesn’t
matter much what happens to the world
so long as a man and his wife are
together, and good friends, at the end.
In Coward’s pageant the path of the
Marryots is paved with an assured in-
come. It is otherwise with _ Joe Gimblet,
drug-store proprietor, and his wife Mary.
They quarrel, and Joe wishes he could
live his life again. He gets his wish.
He is transplanted back to the cross-
roads of his career, marries a rich wife
and rises from financial heights to
national prominence during the Great
War, because he knows exactly what is
coming next and can gamble on certain-
ties.
When Henry Ford comes along with
a scheme for building cheap motor-
cars he finds an enthusiastic ally in Joe.
Woodrow Wilson confers high honor on
him —then ditches him because he starts
talking about the end of war when
Americans are getting war-conscious.
The only thing Joe can’t predict is what
Franklin Roosevelt will do after March
6, 1933, that being the date on which he
was shunted back into the past. In the
end Joe’s vast fortune is wrecked. He
becomes a fugitive from justice, and
wakes up glad to get back to his wife and
cosy little shop.
O. Henry, Cabell and some poets who
wrote many thousands of years ago put
spades into this vein of ore. Its discovery
by Hollywood is welcomed by the writer,
as plagiarisms always will be when they
indicate that the place is taking an intel-
ligent interest in contemporary history.
Lee Tracy plays Joe, and Peggy Shannon
Mary.
In “Diplomaniacs” Bert Wheeler and
Bob Woolsey crack jokes at the expense
of the League of Nations and disarma-
ment conferences, assisted by a band of
shapely chorines. A feature of the thing
is a vamp, ordered over the ’phone and
delivered packed in cellophane, who
makes mechanical love. She’s just a little
gold-digger of the sort Anita Loos pic-
tured, but so true to type that the next
producer of “La Poupee” will be able to
adapt a lot of her tricks with great
effect without impairing the notion that
it is all done by cogs and springs.

“Lord of the Manor,” at Melbourne
Capitol, is a botched barrel of molasses
based on the arrival of a Soviet regime
in England. Any other clothesline would
have served to carry the pants and
bloomers of the old, old theatrical stereo-
types of the cantankerous but kind-
hearted country gentleman, the peppery
Indian colonel, the tall, handsome,
aquiline, calf-witted hero with the mono-
tonous he-man snarl and the rude Cana-
dian manners indicative of the great open
spaces, the colorless heroine and the rest
of them. The promising theme of revolu-
tion holds out expectations which are
faintly adumbrated by Fred Kerr as the
aristocrat aforesaid, who behaves towards
the workers and peasants’ committee
according to “Punch” traditions of
humor.
“Mama Loves Papa” is also molasses
in bulk, but it justifies its existence,
whereas the other doesn’t. Charles
CHARACTERS IN THE TALKIES.
“Why don’tcha come up an! see me some time,” says Mae West (1) to Gary
Grant (2). Mae again, fevvers an’ all (3), and Noah Beery (4) in "She Done
Him Wrong,” at the Regent. (5) Edward G. Robinson in "The Little Giant” on
the same bill.
Ruggles is really funny as a commissioner
for children’s playgrounds who owes his
job to a manufacturer of shoddy equip-
ment ; he gets near enough to life to be
interesting, as does his partner in comedic
pathos, Mary Boland. The American
film is psychology served with candy, the
British is simply candy ; yet in both cases
injections of insulin are indicated.

From Ken G. Hall:
The Shadow Shows reviewer cannot be
allowed to get away with this (B. 4/10/’33):
“The station hacks of ‘The Squatter’s
Daughter’ are convincing with the exception
of Miss Howarth’s. The writer refuses to be-
lieve that a lass in her position would be seen
on a grass-fedder with a loaded forehand and
other evidences of its carty origin.”
Miss Howarth rode three horses in “The
Squatter’s Daughter.” One was Miss Anchau’s
Just It, grand champion hack of Australia,
with enough blue ribbons,_ garnered in four
States, to cover his stall entirely. The second
was Peter, the property of Mrs. Holloway,
of Goonoo Goonoo, and a prizewinner as a
hack at both metropolitan and country shows ;
while the third, used for actual galloping
sequences only, was a racehorse in training.
In fairness to the ladies who so generously
allowed us to use their hacks, and to the equine
bluebloods who would probably, and justifiably,
kick their stalls down at the suggestion of
“carty origin,” I feel sure The Bulletin will
admit to an error of judgment in this case.
With reference to the other “staggerer”—
the “vine-clad station home with Hollywood
swimming pool and cocktail bar complete”— l
it may be as well to point out that the house
in question is the 102-year-old station home-
stead of the Chisholms at Narellan, near
Camden.
In reply:
The Bulletin made no error of judgment
regarding Miss Howarth’s mounts; it is Mr.
Hall who has erred in imagining that movie
publicity methods can be applied to matters
of ascertainable fact. There is no such title
as “grand champion hack of Australia, ana,
if there were, Just It wouldn’t go within
miles of winning it. This alleged “grand cham-
pion” was entered for two hack events at the
last Sydney Show. All he won was a con-
solation prize. ..
The reviewer has seen a still ot miss
Howarth on Just It. He has Plenty of <ear
blood, like most horses of the English hackney
type which he resembles, but he is a fairly good
sort as heavyweights go. However, he isn t
the hack she rides in the film. The animal re-
ferred to (B. 4/10/’33) is the one on which
she gives the hero a lift —and it may be re-
marked, in passing, that a real bush girl
wouldn’t have piled up behind her injured
young man; she would have walked. TTus is
presumably Peter —a grass-fedder of 15 hands,
or less, with straight shoulders, a short rein
and other defects. He has a classier head than
Just It, but he is a long way from being
an “equine blueblood.” Members of the Hollo-
way family brought several hacks to Sydney
last April, and they won a second with
Secret; but they didn’t bring Peter. They
knew too much.
As for the anonymous racehorse, Miss
Howarth makes several moves with a saddle
on her arm in the direction of what might be
a thoroughbred, but a fade-out follows, and
when next seen she is back on Peter —it
that is the grass-fedder’s name.
Mr. Hall’s answer to the suggestion that
Hollywood swimming-pools and cocktail bars
are not to be found at station homes of the
vine-clad order seems to be that the Chisholms
place at Narellan enjoys these amenities. Mem-
bers of the family in Sydney say they have
never heard of them; but suppose they are
there. Narellan isn’t the outback: it is dairy-
ing and poultry-raising country within less than
an hour’s car-drive of Sydney. The Bulletin
repeats that “The Squatter’s Daughter,” despite
some praiseworthy features, _ can’t be taken
seriously as a picture of station life in N. S.
Wales.
Sundry Shows
The music of “Rigoletto” is so well
known that it should be possible to listen
to it appreciatively, and even critically,
while playing bridge. This Showman
made a shot at it on Friday night when
the A.B.C. broadcast the opera. Signor
Izal’s Rigoletto and Lionello Cecil’s Duke
passed with honor —their big moments
occurred in dummy periods, but Norah
Hill’s “Caro Nome” coincided with five
no trumps, doubled and redoubled, which
required more than half a brain to deal
with. It was a very good “Caro Nome,”
but it cost the critic and his partner 1200
above the line, and thereafter he occu-
pied himself gloomily in accumulating
evidences that Miss Hill is not quite so
great a Gilda as Melba was. Utterly
unfair, of course, but that’s one of the
handicaps radio opera must suffer under
in family circles not unanimously and
fanatically devoted to music.
All roads of teaching are capable of
improvement, and the winding path,
paved with rough boulders and bordered
by stinging nettles, that leads to music
has had less attention than others. At
Sydney Con. Hall on Saturday afternoon
Mary Cochran, supported by thirty
youngsters, demonstrated a system of
pianoforte teaching which she has devised.
The fine Italian hand of the Contezza
Montessori pervades the theory of the
methods, but the application of the
theory is in many respects original.
Stance, as they say in golf, is of consider-
able importance. These kiddies showed
they knew how to shape up to the instru-
ment, and many had the fundamentals
of a pleasing touch. As touch is a sub-
ject on which the theorists of four or
five schools conduct highly technical con-
troversies, Miss Cochran’s achievement
deserves a cheer.

“Dregs,” presented by Sydney Theatre
Guild at the Ingersoll Hall on Saturday,
is a protest against war. The story opens
in 1915 in a small English town. The
Mayor, Bamford, is a manufacturing
chemist and an armchair patriot. He
makes recruiting speeches. His daughter
Dorothy belongs to a society which dis-
tributes white feathers. Geoffrey, Barn-
ford’s younger son, first angers his father
by expressing pacifist views, and then
makes the old man angrier still by enlist-
ing. In his son’s absence Bamford sells
to the Government a poison-gas formula
evolved by Geoffrey. When Geoffrey,
who has obtained a commission, learns
that his invention is to be used against
the enemy he commits suicide. When
Dorothy learns how and why her brother
died she blows out her brains with a
revolver. The tragic story, the work of
Arbitration Justice Beeby, is not very
convincingly worked out, and Harry
Raymond, in the role of the pacifist-
minded officer Geoffrey, was unable to
make his didactic speeches sound plaus-
ible. Alice Holsen’s Dorothy and Syd-
ney Rolands’s Bamford showed more life.
* * #
Adelaide Repertory gave three show-
ings to the strange “Thunder in the Air,”
by Robins Millar. A man killed in the
Great War comes back to see if he lives
still, in memory. He does —but variously.
The butler whose life-savings he bor-
rowed and the parson whose wife he
seduced see him as the hopeless black-
guard that he was. The girl he had for
a time been engaged to sees him as a
jolly youth in flannels. His father finds
the thought of him unpleasant; his
mother envisages him as a small boy.
Frank Gunnel (with a clever kiddie, Billy
Long) depicted these various phases bril-
liantly. Frank Johnston, as the unfor-
giving father, and Fred James, as a war
comrade, also scored ; but there was not
a weak point in the cast. Cyril Riley was
producer.

Wirth’s came to Melbourne last week,
and on Friday at the old site, Olympia,
a large audience renewed acquaintance
with the lions, the tigers, the elephants,
the polar bear with the pendulum head
and the joke about the dog that swal-
lowed a tin of carbide and had a set o’
lean pups. The acrobatic Nelsons have
refined their act, which is the most re-
markable tumbling enterprise Melbourne
has seen for a long time. There is a
lady who ties herself into a knot on the
top of a table and two chairs, and another
with 16 monkeys and a terrifying voice,
items of whose stock-in-trade create a
diversion by escaping amongst the audi-
ence. In short, the outfit seems much
the same as heretofore, but its appeal
to the young appears to grow as the years
roll by. This may be because the young
sometimes get tired of talkies. There are
things a circus can’t do that a talkie can,
but there’s a vice versa. For instance,
the screen cannot distribute its personnel,
human or animal, amongst the audience
and it doesn’t do its scene-shifting in
public. That this is a good half of the
fun anybody can see for himself who
takes an unprejudiced eye or a small
boy to Olympia.

money-spinner at the Garrick a few

ABORIGINALITIES
“The Secretary”: Six or seven readers
of this Page have sent in a clipping from
Melbourne “Argus” which describes the
circumstances of a party arranged by the
young men of a Methodist church in
terms calculated to provoke the gaiety of
the evil-minded. Such things are apt to
happen by inadvertence in the best sub-
edited of newspapers, and they are not
worth wider publicity than they origin-
ally obtain. Anyway, I have a warm
spot in my heart for the Methodies. In
the very first year of my career on a
newspaper I was sent to report a Method-
ist social gathering 20 miles outback from
the township which my journal bright-
ened by its presence. I cycled out (no
taxis for reporters in those days) and
when, at about 10 p.m., the chairman, a
venerable gentleman, announced that the
speeches were over and that the rest of
the evening would be devoted to “danc-
ing, singing and feasting,” I climbed
aboard my iron steed and got back to the
office, where I innocently wrote a report
that stated “the proceedings concluded
with a dance.” Next day the telephone
“Are you ready to obey the last summons?”
“Yes, y’r Honor.”
was busy with remonstrances from irate
followers of Wesley, who said the state-
ment was a libel, a slander and a base lie.
The boss had me on the carpet, and the
sack was in his eye, when there was a
rap on the door and in bustled the chair-
man of last evening’s shivoo. He had
driven in 20 miles in his buggy—and he
was nearly 80 —to explain that his own
“silly joke,” as he called it, was entirely
to blame. “You’re Church of England?”
he said, turning to me. “Yes,” said I,
truthfully. “There you are,” said the old
man to the boss. “You should have told
him Methodies don’t dance” ; and he sat
down and wrote a letter to the editor,
taking all the blame.
“Eureka”: “I’ll never forget my intro-
duction to Bourke,” said old Ned. “I
landed there on a very hot day and was
chased out of the town.” “What was
wrong?” I asked. “Well, I was carryin’

everyone thought I was liable to pinch

“J.H.”: “Myhree’s” grandfather (B.
6/9/’33) slipped in saying that Ned
Kelly left notes explaining his borrowing
of neighbors’ horses. Ned could neither
read nor write. After he was outlawed
he visited Greta only on dark, stormy
nights, and didn’t advertise his presence
or business. Joe Byrne was the scholar
of the gang, and it was he who explained
to the others the proclamations tacked
to trees offering rewards for their appre-
hension. I saw Ned once, on a Sunday
morning early in 1880. My brother and
I were playing at the back of our father’s
pub at Bethanga (Vic.), when four horse-
men rode up. We boys knew two of
them at once by description—Byrne and
Ned Kelly. We bustled out, tingling with
excitement, and offered to stable the nags.
Byrne said “No.” Ned added: “We
might want them in a hurry.” Byrne and
the other two went inside and dad served
them with drinks, but Ned stayed on
watch and chatted to us youngsters —he
was no boozer. 1 can still remember how
hunted and haggard he looked.

“Cancer”: The strange crabs which
infested the coastal waters near Mel-
bourne, and which were lately found
to be dying out rapidly, are going
under to a bacterial infection. Boring
algae, such as attack corals and other
calcareous marine creatures, first make
holes in the shells through which the
bacteria enter. It recalls H. G. Wells s
story “The War of the Worlds,” in which
the Martian monsters, having made a suc-
cessful invasion of the Earth, find them-
selves unable to withstand terrestrial bac-
teria and succumb in short order.

“Jimmy the Swallower”: A gentleman
appearing on some minor charge in
a Sydney police court indignantly repu-
diated a police assertion that he could
drink 14 pints of beer while standing
on his head. “No,” he interposed;
“sixteen.” The feat, so rare nowadays
and therefore to be cherished by those
able to perform it, was once a com-
monplace in the pubs of the great out-
back, and did not attract undue attention.
A much more difficult one was the
pouring of the contents of a bottle of
beer, held high over the head with one
hand, down the throat without swallow-
ing. Still another, and one very popular
with the publicans at the annual races,
was the drinking of a quart of champagne
out of the bottle, from the moment the
cork was ejected, without removing the
neck from the mouth or choking. This
last was rarely accomplished and many
a flash mug was taken down over it. Still,
it was done. There were giants in those
days.
* * * *
“A.M.R.”: On the island of Tanna
(New Hebrides) the drinking of kava is
not the pleasant, friendly ceremonial
known in the islands of Polynesia. The
decoction is made from a species of
wild pepper plant, the root of which is
chewed, and the resultant mess mixed
with water. It is prepared and drunk in
silence at sunset, and at no other time,
It was once masticated by young boys,
Nowadays the imbiber has to prepare it
himself, the modern Tanna youth being
adverse to the permanently blackened
teeth which mark the kava-chewer. No
woman is allowed to be present or any-
where near the kava house, where the
drinkers sit cross-legged until the effects
wear off and the kava spirits depart. In
“Me daughter’s one o’ ’em fresh-air cranks. Opens all the doors and winders
ev’ry time I go ter see ’er.”
the past most of the murders and
massacres were plotted in the kava hut,
which is one of the reasons why Mel-
anesian missionaries have banned the
tipple. In the old days, at sunset, the kava
cry rang, weird and fierce, from one end
of Tanna’s thirty miles’ length to the
other, but now is not often heard on the
coast, being confined to the mountain
districts. There old ex-cannibals still
sound their quavering call, and sit dream-
ing of the crunch of the blood-drinking
club, the acrid smell of burning huts and
the taste of cooked human flesh.
* * * *
“Walkabout”: It’s surprising the
quantity of water some people think a
bottle-tree contains. Fiction has it that
scores of bush wanderers have been
saved from a drouthy death by drinking
it. A recent analysis not only proves
that the water content is very small, but
that the tree when chopped down is
valueless as stock fodder, the long stringy
fibres being apt to cause impaction.
* * * *
“V.V.”: “Max’s” reference to “dulse”
(B. 11/10/’33) brings to my mind a North
of Ireland railway station
where vendors parade baskets
of dulse just as oystermen
vend their wares at Hawkes-
bury River when the trains
arrive. It is dripping with the
fresh brine of the ocean, and
teeth need to be pretty good
to tackle it, for it is like thin
strips of rubber, just as
springy, though not quite so
tough. The taste for the stuff
is not often acquired after the
age of ten, but a farthing’s
worth is as acceptable to an
Irish child as a threepenny cake of
chocolate to an Australian youngster.
* * * *
“Dr. Mivart”: “I crushed him with a
glance!” said my niece Hortensia. and
then, defiantly: “Go on, explain in words
any infant could understand why I
couldn’t have.” “My dear girl,” I said,
“what are we discussing? Grammar, the
theory of mesmerism or physics?”
“Physics!” retorted my niece. “Righto,”
I retorted, “you asked for it, and you’re
going to have it. I’m not going to con-
trovert your assertion, but I’m going to
exhibit you in your true brutal colors.
If you had read Newton (on Optics), De
Broglie, Schrodinger and Oliver Lodge,
and were acquainted with the simple
Einsteinian formula ‘Energy equals mass
multiplied by the square of the velocity
of light,’ you would realise that every
time you let blaze a blast from your
starlike eyes you exercise the tyranny
of a giant. The sun, beaming on this
earth as impartially and genially as l
look at even such provocative objects as
you are, has been convicted, on the
authority of Prof. G. S. Eve, of smack-
ing 160 tons per diem into the orb where-
on we exist. Light, my dear, has weight,
and is matter, and when twin stars such
as you control bend their fearful ener-
gies on such a poor worm as Percy it is
only by a miracle he survives.” “Is that
so?” replied my sister’s daughter. “Well,
go and read up your physics again, with
especial reference to Einschwiller and his
computation that the pressure of light is
10 grams to the hectare. Perce has a
large hide but I don’t flatter myself I
entirely scotched him. He’ll be round
again.” The worst of teaching girls
science is that they use it only for polemic
purposes.
* * * *
“Elaps”: Queensland herpetologists
are puzzled over the disappearance of
those death adders (B. 18/10/’33). They
don’t think much of the theory that the
destruction of prickly pear has deprived
the serpent of the cover it loves and left
it naked to its enemies ; for elsewhere
the adder is not particularly keen on
cover —on a hot day you’ll find him in
the middle of a road as likely as not.
Heber Longman, of the Q’land Museum,
has advanced what looks like the right
reason. Much as you might not think so,
the sluggish adder lives largely on small
birds. These he captures while lying in
his favorite curve in the dust, the spine
on his tail being slightly twitched when
a fowl approaches. Taking this for a
worm or caterpillar, the bird makes a
dive and so does the adder, and the
adder has the advantage of surprise. The
clearing of the pear has caused many
varieties of small birds which affect
thick cover to change their quarters, and
the adder has had to follow the commis-
sariat.
* * * *
“Dai R.”: Concerning “M.L.C.’s”
theory (B. 11/10/’33) of light attraction,
any timberman knows that wood-eating
insects, while spending the larval period
nomadising through tortuous galleries in
botanical innards, immediately on attain-
ing adulthood take the shortest cut to
the outside. They are not guided by the
grain, for sometimes the exit tunnels are
with it, sometimes across it, and occa-
sionally, owing to the shape of the wood,
both. Henri Fabre says tree-born in-
sects “will gnaw through metal if
need be rather than turn their back upon
the light, which they feel to be close at
hand.” In the Crimean war days “the
Institut de France received some packets
of cartridges in which the bullets had
been perforated by Sirex juvencul ; a
little later, at the Grenoble Arsenal, S.
gigas carved himself a similar exit.” The
larvae, he explains, were in the cartridge-
box timber, and “the adult insect had
bored through the lead because the near-
est daylight was behind that obstacle.” At
Mineral Hills (N.S.W.) some years ago
I found in a green length I split for
posts the blade of a pocket-knife with
three holes in it corresponding with the
tunnel of a boring insect on either side.
I’ve known white ants to eat through
ironwork in an old mine, but I think
’twas pure cussedness with them.

“Frigid”: If “F.G.G.” (B. 4/10/’33)
takes another squint at the label on the
death adder in the School of Arts
museum at Bundaberg, he will find it says
3ft. Oiin., not 3ft. Next time he
contradicts me I hope The Bulletin will
insist on a photograph of the evidence
and a properly attested affidavit.

of justice as follows: “Big fight along

“Te Kapo”: Although the kumara
held pride of place on Henare’s menu,
aruhe, the fern rhizone of Pteris aqui-
lina, ran a close second, and was a per-
fect godsend to the warrior, being verit-
ably the food of heroes. Anybody who
has tasted it raw will agree that the old-
time Maori’s digestive mechanism must
have been perfect, for it is bitter, pun-
gent and almost indigestible. But with
the fibres removed and the meal kneaded
into cakes, softened with water and then
roasted crisp, it’s a mighty different dish.
The slight bitterness remaining needs to
be removed by the addition of sweet
juice made from the ripe berries of the
tutu ( Coriaria ruscifolia), but even with-
out this it is nutritious and not un-
pleasant, particularly in early summer,
when the fern-root is at its best. Very
different are the tuberous bulbs from the
roots of para fern; even after being
cooked for hours they’re apt to turn you
mto a chronic dyspeptic.
* * * *
“M.L.C.”: Most carnivorous animals
prey on those smaller and slower than
themselves, but an exception is the stoat,
which consumes rabbits, faster sprinters
and stouter fellows than himself. There
is a nebulous theory that when a rabbit
smells a stoat he goes all of a helpless
tremble, but science hasn’t yet evolved a
means of proving the pathological effect
of odors. A creature credited with hyp-
notic power is the tree snake of Malaya,
lately introduced to the London Zoo. It
has a long-pointed head with peculiar
markings. On its tongue are identical
markings. When a small bird or lizard is
presented to it the reptile thrusts its
tongue in and out so rapidly that the
whole head is reported to look like a
“diabolically animated telescope.” The
victim, confronted with this display, be-
comes statuesque with surprise, and falls
an easy prey.
* * * *
“Gilbulla”: Some Australian moths
attain surprising dimensions. A North
Queensland emperor moth, Coscinocera
hercules, measures in some cases 10|in.
across wings, and from front to back.
A leopard-moth, Xyleutes boisduvali,
boasts a wing-spread of quite lOin. The
great swift-moth, Leto stacyi, well-known
in the Newcastle district (N.S.W.), may
attain to 9in. or more across the wings, in
the case of the females; while the hawk-
moth, Coequosa triangularis, has a wing
expanse of Bin.
* * * *
“M.L.C.”: Extreme individualists are
to be found in the sea. There is a species
of marine worm whose tail becomes self-
assertive and determines to play the lead-
ing part. It accordingly grows a head of
its own, and the next time a difference of
opinion occurs it digs in its toes and re-
fuses to budge. There is a final split, and
the front half crawls unconcernedly away
and develops a new tail, which in time
also asserts its independence. Sea-urchins
have been described as “the republics of
reflexes.” Each tiny spine works inde-
pendently and turns like a lance at an
approaching enemy—even a single spine
attached to a chip of the shell will bristle
when alarmed. But the starfish is perhaps
the most interesting example of inde-
pendent action. Fishermen, infuriated by
the havoc wrought to nets and oyster-
beds, often chop them in half and throw
them overboard. This is a mistake, as
each half proceeds to develop into a com-
plete fish. If a fragment of the central
disc is attached one isolated arm can grow
the missing parts. Like the worm, the star-
fish multiplies by internal strife. After
living peaceably together for a while the
arms appear to quarrel and group them-
selves into two factions. Both groups
then walk off as hard as they can in
opposite directions until the tug-of-war
splits the central disc in half; then,
apparently to their mutual satisfaction,
each half settles down to complete its
growth. When a starfish is turned on its
back each arm independently twists over
at the tip to pull at the ground and right
itself. The first arm that procures a
good grip sends a message to the others
to stop pulling, and when they remain
“And what will yer do with me glands, eh? S’pose y’ll give them to some old
coot like yerself so’s ’e can get up to ’is monkey tricks again.”
passive one arm can right the whole fish.
These messages are communicated by the
ring round the mouth. Should this be
severed between each pair of arms they
will struggle against each other.
* * * *
“Bluegum”: Though artistic and other
conventions demand that our native bear
be depicted as foolishly amiable, he is dis-
tinctly one of the ursine
family of which Buffon
wrote: “This animal is dan-
gerous when attacked.”
Writer once saw an old koala
make a wreck of an Irish
terrier which had achieved a
reputation as a cat-killer. His
owner sooled him on the
bushdweller in the confident
hope that a new record would
go to his tyke’s credit. It
did. For long afterwards he
was easily the most ragged-
looking brute in the suburb,
with ears that waved in the
breezes in elfin locks, like a
seasick flapper’s bingle. I
am moved to this reminis-
cence by reading of the ex-
perience of two motorists
driving from Newcastle to
Sydney. On the road, in the
glare of the headlights, they
saw an old man koala and
pulled up to avoid running
over him. Mr. Bear misinter-
preted the kindness. “This,”
he said to himself, “is an
attack in force by big bat-
talions.” So he flew at the
tyres and scratched bits out
of them, and when the tra-
vellers tried to prise him off
he scratched bits out of them.
Sydney Hospital later sup-
plied iodine and bandages to
the humans. The bear went
back to his gum-trees, and is
now proudly awaiting the time when his
grandchildren will ask him what he did
in 1933.

“Sailor”: N.T. abo. “letter sticks”
are, in my opinion, all bunk. Louis, a
Bathurst Islander, working at Darwin
Hospital, received one of these sticks in
my presence, and on being asked what
message it told he appeared to read from
the hieroglyphic carvings that he was
wanted at home to take part in a family
fight—some argument over unwelcome
attentions paid to his lubra. I asked him
to give me the stick, which he did. One
day I showed it to Singapore, one of
Louis’s henchmen. Singapore told me
that the hieroglyphs meant that Louis’s
lubra was shortly to give birth to a picca-
ninny. The next one I asked was a
black brother named Charlie and his ver-
sion was that Louis’s lubra had quar-
relied with another lubra concerning the
latter’s piccaninny,
* * * *
“Homfrey Beale”: The Cumborah
(nor’-west N.S.W.) hotel, which, owing
to diminution of trade to vanishing point,
was the other day closed, on the appli-
cation of the licensee, was the butt of
many bush legends. One of the oftenest
told was of an early licensee who used
to expedite trade by keeping a block of
rock salt on the bar counter and giving
substantial money prizes for the great-
est number of licks in a given time, till
the crowd got so thirsty that it boozed
its collective cheque and the prize money
as well. Another was of the unsophisti-
cated intruder who, on asking for a
rum, was told that he’d have to wait
awhile, as it was just coming to the boil.
A factor in the final act of the pub’s
life, unmentioned at the hearing, was
Rotten Plain, a soggy stretch of coun-
try that hides beneath its malign surface
more vehicle debris to the mile than any
other part of the Commonwealth. Across
it, via Cumborah, once flowed the traffic
through Goodooga to Queensland, but
the route was discarded after a track
was blazed through Lightning Ridge.

“E.S.”: As to “jackeroo” (B. 5/10/’33),
according to Stewart Russell’s “Genesis
of Queensland,” the name was given by
the Brisbane River blacks to the first
horseman they had ever seen. That was
near Ipswich, where a military station
had been established. The stranger,
described by them as “a big dog with six
legs,” was crashing through the timber
toward the Brisbane River. The aston-
ished myalls rushed to the outpost and
implored the commander to send soldiers
out to shoot the monster. “Why didn’t
you spear it?” asked the commandant.
“Mine too frightened,” replied the leader,
“Jackeroo strong pfeller. All about black-
pfeller too frightened.” Some of the men
went out to investigate, and met a
mounted party from the Darling Downs,
out to discover pastoral country. One of
the horsemen was a long-legged new-
chum, riding wide on a small, nuggety
horse which he was continually kick-
ing. This was the combination that had
impressed the myalls. “Jackeroo!” they
said in scared voices.
-fc * *
“Pat Bushie”: Reports are coming in
of attempts at defeating drought by
sprinkling water from hoses fixed between
balloons, which is supposed to encour-
age the formation of rain. A more prom-
ising line of investigation was opened up
a few years ago, when aeroplanes soared
high above the clouds scattering fine dust.
It was claimed that these dust particles,
falling through the air, collected moisture
and induced rain to fall. Records show
that light showers of rain did actually
result from some of these attempts.

General O’Duffy, of Ireland, is indig-
nant because he was hit on the head

dicted in these notes last week, matters
were rapidly coming to a head in Ire-

Galaxy of Glorious Talent.
(By “Judicious”)
A field of world-shattering equine stars
will face the barrier to-morrow in that
race of cosmopolitan * fame the Kid
Stakes.
Topping the weights we find the in-
comparable Master Moron. Master
Moron is one of Nature’s Masterpieces.
We have, we
grieve to say, a
criticism to level,
but, in the inter-
ests of journal-
ist i c integrity,
levelled it must
and shall be:
Master Moron’s
left ear is not all
it should be.
Prominent in the
betting, and in
the hearts of his
mighty public, is
the amazing Eng-
lish importation
Windgall. “T h e
most distinguish-
ed horse that has
yet come out
of Yowler-under-
Ooze,” remarked
Mr. Jas. Dodder,
of the “Blurb,”
last night. We
agreed, but added
shrewdly: “His
teeth might be
bettered,” thus
registering impartiality.
And then there is that amazing, scin-
tillating All-Aussie Champion The
Roarer. Challenging The Roarer at the
distance will be found, if we mistake not,
Mug’s Despair, as brilliant a performer
as ever looked through a horsecollar (or
should it be “bridle”?).
There are a dozen more equally good.

INFAMOUS GARDENS ON SHOW.
The exhibition of Sydney’s Famous
Gardens in aid of the Free Kindergartens
being over, the public may now inspect
some of our Harbor City’s outstandingly
Infamous Gardens. Admission will be
by a silver (or other)
coin, the proceeds to
be allotted to my Free
Drinks Fund.
The first on the
roster of Gardens
Horrible will be my
own. Situated in the
Dress Circle of Tur-
rawoonga, and cpm-
manding a panoramic
view of the municipal
gas- and waterworks,
Aphistica Villa is a
source of keen inter-
est to over-the-fence
experts.
“How do you raise
’em?” queried “Blue-
gum,” of the ‘Blob,”
the other evening.
And, after a pause,
“You’d make your
fortune in France, old
man.” He was referring
.to the snails, which,
owing to the rich
nature of my plant-
growth, attain a pro-
digious size.
On the right of the
charming front gate
of Aphistica Villa we
find the Unsunken
Rosarium, consisting of three speci-
mens. The pink Maman Cochet has
not grown more than an inch or so since
LTi&IS VT
curious botanist. Near by is another
Maman Cochet, which was bought as a
dwarf but turned out to be a climber.
The aimless, gangling effect of its unsup-
ported shoots is very quaint. Finally we
have a nameless rose known to the neigh-
bors as “The Aloe.” They say it only
flowers once in seven years—if then.
The twelve minute green stumps in the
centre bed were originally sixpenn’orth
of Rosy Morn petunias. As showing the
health and vigor of our Aphistica Villa
snails, it may be mentioned that the Rosy
Morns, which I put in last Saturday even-
ing, were like this when inspected on
Sunday at 6 a.m.
An enjoyable and instructive tour is
brought to a close at the celebrated
Aphistica Rockery, which has often been
compared with
that of Mr. Syd-
ney Snow at
Bonnie Brae. One
thing 1 will say in
all modesty for
our rockery ; the
component parts
are looser. It was
a black day for
the local dogs
when my boy
Horace decided
to build it on a
site near our kit-
chen door. A
ve ntur esome
Aberdeen, say,
arrives in pursuit
of the cat. Just
as he realises that
he has blundered
into what is vir-
tually an ambush,
the wife appears.
The gate already
mentioned offers
the horrified ani-
mal his only
iiicti him only
avenue of escape.. To grab a piece of
the rockery, and bounce it off the fleeing
intruder’s hide, is a fetit which the fair
chatelaine of Aphistica Villa can bring
off three times out of four.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Gaine Carrington justified The Bulle-
tin’s expectations by taking the Caulfield
Cup. He started at 12 to 1 (fifteens were
laid), from which fact it may be inferred
that Cecil Godby and his patron, J. A.
Phillips, the bookmaker, went cold on
the Hunting Song stallion’s prospects.
Produced for the Toorak Handicap on
the opening day at Caulfield, Gaine Car-
rington could not get nearer than third ;
hence the remunerative Caulfield Cup
quotation.
In large part the credit of the victory
must be ascribed to Pike, who can get
the best out of a mount without touch of
whip or spur. The race was run in the
Australasian record time of 2min. 281 sec.
for 11 miles, half a second faster than
Compris occupied for the journey at
Wellington (M.L.) in January, 1932, and
2sec. faster than the previous Caulfield
Cup record, established by High Syce
four years ago. Yet such is the artistry
of Pike that Gaine Carrington seemed
as untroubled as if he were merely doing
a track gallop. The issue was beyond
doubt a furlong from home, Jimmie
Boy (50 to 1) being beaten by 11 lengths.
Oro came from nowhere to run third,
a head behind Jimmie Boy, and shrewd
punters immediately began to discuss the
Melbourne Cup prospects of Hunter
White’s chestnut. Even more impressive
was the achievement of Pretzel in finish-
ing fifth, after being a clear last five fur-
Bert; our horse is
VXINHIKIG) T
Bert:
. // . /
G\e.rt. uust look act the le*o its
\N

Bert'. *N\y dear, the horses beh^o
KRE IM THE NEXT RWE,'
longs from home. Bailey Payten’s can-
didate was unfancied on Saturday, 25 to
1 being obtainable. He has 51b. less to
carry in the Melbourne Cup.
Break Up (fourth) shaped excellently,
and is sure of a large following at Flem-
ington. He was on the scene throughout.
Middle Watch acquitted himself credit-
ably, but was subsequently reported lame.
His condition has occasioned Tindall a
lot of worry. Waltzing Lily actually
started a better favorite than Kuvera on
the tote, but after being one of the early
leaders she faded out. Kuvera, accord-
ing to McCarten, went well to the half-
mile, where weight began to tell. Segati
(equal second-favorite with Waltzing
Lily) whipped in the field; she was
smothered in the pack, the trainer says,
and never got a chance of stretching
out. Godby and Phillips were censured
by the stewards for shaking hands with
Pike before he weighed in ; Pike was in-
cluded in the reprimand.
Fillies acquired by A. G. Hunter at
the last Sydney yearling sales are turn-
ing out trumps. Hunter scored with
Hustle On, a daughter of Baralong, at
Flemington. On Caulfield Cup day he
annexed the fillies’ division of the Mona
Nursery with Adored, who is by Constant
Son from the dam of Amounis. This is
the first of the progeny of Constant Son
to catch the judge’s eye. Constant Son
was imported by Percy Miller in 1930
and claims Son-in-Law as sire, besides
tracing back to La Fleche. The original
buyer of Adored at 120gns. wanted to be
relieved of the purchase and the filly was
passed along to Hunter, to whom she may
prove as great a bargain as Windbag did
to Robert Miller in similar circumstances.
Adored went out at 50 to 1. She led all
the way and scored by half a length from
Queen Helen, who finished at express
speed to beat the odds-on favorite, Waltz-
ing Nellie, by a head for second honors.
Sun Clad is the most consistent of this
season’s two-year-olds. He was second
to Fashion Plate in the A.J.C. Breeders’
Plate, and won a race each day at Caul-
field. The 101 b. penalty incurred by Sun
Clad on Saturday brought his impost up
to 9st., and enabled J. Pike to be secured
as jockey. Just when John Wren’s colt
Angelo appeared to have the measure of
Sun Clad 50 yards from home, Pike gave
the favorite his head and instantly
settled the issue.
Three of the events on Saturday went
to Sydney horses. Shakuni took the Bur-
wood Handicap (for three-year-olds),
Sun Clad the colts and geldings’ division
of the Mona Nursery, and Closing Time
the first division of the Windsor Handi-
cap. In the second division of the last-
named event Melason reduced the course
record for six furlongs to lmin. llsec.
The regrading of the Caulfield course and
banking it up at the turns have been
highly conducive to speed.
* * * *
Next Saturday the Moonee Valley
Gold Cup will be contested. Final accept-
ances are not due until Thursday, and it
is impossible to forecast the personnel of
the field. Highway ran very prominently
in the Caulfield Cup, and, with 21b. less
to carry at the Valley, he may take a lot
of beating if notable Melbourne Cup
aspirants, such as Kuvera, Topical, Oro
and Regal Son, be withdrawn. But Taisho
looks better to this critic. The winner
may come from Taisho, Segati, Picatus
and Highway.
* * * *
Racecourse attendances are improving
in Sydney as well as Melbourne ; over
7000 people visited Warwick Farm. Out-
siders were successful in three events and
generally the bookmakers had a win-
ning day. The Caulfield races were
broadcast, and the Farm events so
arranged that there was no clash. The
innovation was popular.
Both divisions of the Maiden Handicap
brought joy to the bookies. In the first
heat the Brazen gelding Heyday (12 to 1)
won narrowly from the locally-trained Im-
peril (20 to 1), with the favorite, Falstaff,
brother to Dermid and Havaspot, third.
The second division went to a Heroic
filly, Loversall, who is raced and trained
by Dan Swanson, of Warwick Farm. She
practically led all the way to beat the
Ascot-trained Padding Queen; Chief -
ava was third. Ansland, from Newcastle,
was the opening favorite, but he eased
when it was seen that the jockey had
drawn number 16 marble. Ansland ran
sixth.
Raced by L. Manley and H. Foster, a
bookmaker, King’s Head, a good type of
colt by the Phalaris horse Bullhead from
Ferntree, won the Juvenile in capital
style from Booth’s filly Caravel Girl, a
sister to Caravel Boy, with The Black
Cat a good third. W. Kelso’s filly Mis-
nomer showed a lot of pace.
Little Bill Wedgewood (4 to 1), who is
trained on a dairy-farm near Picton, is
proving a goldmine for the Scott brothers.
Badly away in the Macquarie Grove Han-
dicap, he got a wonderful run on the
rails and beat the favorite, Tingalba, and
Circus Star —also one of the last to leave
.the barrier. Bill Wedgewood was bred
by his owners ; his sire, Bicolor, is a full
brother to Windbag. He was ridden by
the apprentice Parkes, who has won most
of his races on the little stallion.
The Bulletin man tipped Legislator
(10 to 1) to win the Varroville Handicap.
Piloted by the apprentice Stephens, Legis-
lator was having his first run in I. H.
Andrews’s colors. Coming fast in the
straight, he defeated Highboy and
the favorite, King Pin, and had some-
thing in hand. Legislator has had
many owners and trainers. He was first
raced by the Say wells, then by C. P.
Brown, then by E. H. (Teddy) Knight.
Andrews has him in fine trim, and he
may pick up a race of the Villiers type
at Randwick.
Cherbourg, who now carries the colors
of Randwick trainer Price, essayed to
win the Homebush Handicap all the way.
However, Dark Chief (5 to 1) was always
chasing him, and when he threw out
a challenge Cherbourg was soon in
trouble. Master Brierly came from the
clouds to get the minor placing. Love
Song, the opening favorite, ran sourly.
Lion Hearted, looking in much better
condition than when he was made favor-
ite at Randwick, was backed from eights
to fives for the Farm Stakes. Badly
placed at the half-mile, he got a lucky
run on the rails and went on to beat
the outsider Ledger Line and the New-
castle-trained Sir Joe. Lion Hearted is a
Magpie, and will score in better company.

Encourage Stakes: First Balloon ; next,
Alleviate.

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Lurich took on a real wrestler, Jack
Clarke, an American, at Leichhardt on
Saturday, and was licked. Headlocks
and short-arm scissor holds placed him
in danger many times during the first
couple of rounds, and a perfectly
executed back-slam outed him in the
third. The Russian still lay spreadeagled
as the bell rang for the fourth, so Clarke
was crowned. An ambulance was re-
quisitioned to take Lurich to the hos-
pital ; but it wasn’t as bad as all that.
Racquet and Bawl
“Cut Shot”: Already on the other side
of the world they are getting ready for
the next Davis Cup series. The first
round must be over by May 20, the second
by June 12, the third by June 21 and the
final on July 16. The inter-zone final
begins on July 19 and the challenge
round with the cup-holders, England, on
July 26 at Wimbledon. The new system
of eliminating all but eight teams in the
European zone by a knock-out competi-
tion held at the end of last season has
considerably simplified matters.
* * * *
“Amateur Pro.”: Following on the
going-over of Ellsworth Vines to the
ranks of the professionals there was a
stir when it was announced that Jack
Crawford would appear on the stage of
a theatre in Sydney for a week’s talk on
the game. Of course, anything of the
sort would rupture John’s amateur status,
and he was quick to deny the story. He
has also given an emphatic denial to
Tilden’s hint that the Australian would
be an early recruit to the paid ranks.
However, Tilden was just as positive
about Vines some time ago, and his fore-
cast in that case has proved a correct one.
If Vines is worth £20,000 to the Tilden
circus, our Australian lad should easily
command a similar rating. Something
has been said about keeping Crawford
in Australia by finding better provision
for him than that he at present enjoys.
If a higher bid for his retention could
be made here than that which caused
Vines to cross over most of us would be
surprised. No one disbelieves Jack’s
statement that professionalism is far from
his thoughts at present. Nevertheless,
the pathway of a man whose standing in
the world depends entirely on his ability
to play a game for a few fleeting years is
beset with temptations.

Ins and Outs
The latest addition to the N.S.W. Shef-
field Shield team, Fred Mair, marked his
appreciation of his selection by taking 9
for 81 for Balmain against the premiers,
Cumberland, in Saturday’s grade cricket.
In the first innings he had collected 8 for
77, so had the outstanding figures of 17
for 158 for the match. If he is not care-
ful, Mair may yet find a place in the
Sydney testimonial match.
* * * *
“The Hill”: The trustees of Sydney
Cricket Ground have at last arrived at
the stage of completing the plans for en-
larging the grounds. Nice blueprints
show that accommodation for 120,000
has been provided, but that is as far as
matters have got, though the Melbourne
C. G. folk have already made big addi-
tions to the provision for spectators and
are well on with a scheme of extending
their area still further. As matters
stand, the S.C.G. has £50,000 of its own.
Its plans will cost £150,000 to complete,
and it wants a grant of £50,000 from the
Government and a loan of £50,000 lrom
the unemployment-relief funds.
* * * *
“Aigburth”: Some of the charges for
the forthcoming Australian matches in
England would make our patrons ol
cricket wince. The minimum price to
see a game with a county from the outer
—and it is very “out” on most English
county grounds—is 2s. For Tests the
minimum at matches outside London will
be 2s. 6d., and 3s. at Lord’s and the Oval.
In county matches play will start at 12
noon and end at 6.30. For Tests the
hours will be from 11.30 to 6.30.

The Australian Rugby Leaguers in
England had another poor week against
the Northern Union clubs. Though they
narrowly defeated the very weak Hunslet
club in the Wednesday match by 22-18,
they were trounced by Salford, which
heads the Northern Union list this sea-
son, scores being 16-9 against the tour-
ists. Starting off with 11 consecutive
wins, the Australians have lost four
the five subsequent matches, this sug-
gesting staleness through over-prepara-
tion and training, a trouble to which pro-
fessional footballers are notoriously
liable,

back a sadder and wiser youth, and his

“Shell”: While Bob Pearce cannot
leave Canada (B. 18/10/’33), he is will-
ing to take on Alf Burns, of N.S.W., or
any other sculler in sight in that country,
He asks for a stake of at least £5OO a side,
and, while Burns is willing enough, find-
ing the money will be a problem in these
days of faded interest in professional
sculling. In his decision to defend his
title in Canada, where he won it, Pearce
is only following precedent.
* * * *
“Shell” : N.S.W. scullers are talking
about forming a separate State associa-
tion. The Ma State rowing authorities
look after the business at present, and a
Ay in the scullers’ beer is that they must
pay subscriptions they can sometimes ill
afford to clubs. The sculler is a lone wolf
in a way, for he uses the club sheds little,
and is also expected to supply his own
shell, an item costing anything from £3O
up. Failing the formation of a new
body it is suggested that scullers may
become members of the N.S.W.R.A. for
a ss. fee without being called on to join
a club, and the association is understood
to be agreeable to this.

Ins and Outs
“Cash Amateur”: The Ma State cricket
heads have announced that subscription
lists to augment the funds of the
Andrews-Collins-Kelleway benefit match,
which begins in Sydney on Nov. 24, have
been opened. Admirers may send con-
tributions for any one of the trio or for
the general fund. The C.A. is itself
putting £l5O in the hat, besides £5O to
swell the stocking of the Blackie-Iron-
monger testimonial game in Melbourne,
which opens a week earlier.
* * * *
“Old Trafford”: As one who was much
exposed to English cricket of an earlier
day, I am interested in the manner in
which Duckworth and Larwood have
been permitted by their county authori-
ties and the Marylebone Club to indulge
in loutish abuse of Australian cricketers
and even criticism of the Old Lady of
Lord’s. Larwood had the nerve to accuse
the M.C.C. of “climbing down” over the
bodyline bowling question and of sacri-
ficing himself by “putting back the
clock.” It is an eloquent comment on
the changing times when a professional
gladiator is permitted to utter impertin-
ences of the sort. In the days when W. G.
Grace, A. N. Hornby, A. J. Webbe, Lord
Hawke and some others controlled the
game with a keen eye to its best interests
and those of all connected with it, the
discipline would have been swift and
drastic. A little of the old-time strong
hand would do no harm to-day..
* * * *
“Tenth Slip”: N.S.W. is first in the
field with the selection of its Sheffield
Shield team for the match with Queens-
land which starts at Brisbane on Novem-
ber 3. It includes most of last year’s
players, including the Test-match men
and two newcomers to Sheffield cricket
in Mair (Balmain) and Little (St. George).
A medium-fast, right-hand bowler who
is fond of mixing ’em and has a really
good bosie for special occasions, Mair
may prove a decided success. He is a
good batsman also, and a fine fieldsman.
Little is a country player making his
bow in Sydney this year. He scored a
grand century for the Northern Districts
against Jardine’s side in Newcastle last
season and has been shaping well for
St. George. Alan Kippax will skipper
the side.
* * * *
An ill-advised section of the Board of
Control—an alliance between Queens-
land and Victorian delegates—has de-
manded a special meeting to reopen the
question of the bodyline barge, which all
except a few fanatics considered happily
settled. It protests that the M.C.C. reply
to the board’s cable does not specifically
promise that bodyline will not be per-
mitted in future. Nearly everyone in
Australia is satisfied that the reply carries
a tacit undertaking to discontinue the
bowling objected to, and when the special
meeting of the board is held on Oct. 30
the foolish proposal is assured of defeat.
Queensland and Victorian delegates can
muster five votes —all the other States,
with eight votes in all, are already com-
mitted to the status quo. All the same,
the action of the recalcitrants, wasting
time and costing money as it does,
strengthens the opinion that fresh blood
is needed on the board.
* * * *
“Molly”: One of the peculiarities of
Australian cricket is the number of left-
hand batsmen of the highest class which
this country has turned out. In England,
curiously enough, with the exception of
Reggie Spooner and, perhaps, Mead, one
cannot think of a real top-notch molly-
hander in big cricket. Here there is a
long list from Harry Moses to Warren
Bardsley, while the young entry promises
to carry on the tradition. In first class or
close to it there are at least three left-
hand candidates for the next Australian
eleven, Darling, Nitschke and O’Brien.
What is the reason for it?
* * * *
“Members’ Stand”: The N.S.W. cricket
authorities are annoyed because the
Board of Control won’t let its selectors
choose the Rest of Australia teams to
play Victoria and N.S.W. in the benefit
matches. But the affair is entirely one
for the States. The matches are their
funerals and not the board’s, and it is
up to them to do their own work in-
stead of leaning on the central authority.
Further, a standing order of the board’s
prevents the Australian selectors from
taking on the job.

The Nineteenth Hole
“Brassey”: The terrors of Canberra
have been augmented this summer as far
as the golfers are concerned. In addition
to the political players and the feathered
magpies, a particularly fine herd of snakes
has established itself on the links. These
do not affect the fairways, but, since Can-
berra golfers are just as apt as others
to get into the rough, most of the mem-
bers have thus early made acquaintance
with them there. One player following
his ball into “tiger” country fortunately
had a dog to lead the way. The tyke
bailed up a large brown snake which
was lying close to the ball.
* * * *
“Baffy”: A feature of the close cham-
pionship of N.S.W. decided in Sydney
was that caddies were allowed to compete.
The event had previously been confined to
members of the P.G.A. and to amateur
members of recognised golf clubs whose
handicaps made them eligible to enter
for open competitions. Two caddies,
Bourke and Saxby, made a good show-
ing, Bourke finishing the second day with
a card of 72, the best produced.
* * * *
“Sturt”: Toogood retained the profes-
sional golf championship of S.A. by
deadly accuracy: 75, 75, 74, and a final
72 —296. The better-known McMahon
was second with 298, and Rufus Stewart
(now fully restored to health) third with

“Divot Digger”: There is a feeling in
the golf world that now St. Andrews
has started revising the rules it might
go on with a few more improvements.
One sadly needed would make it com-
pulsory for that curse of every golf club,
the slow and deliberate player who per-
sists on his pottering course regardless of
his partner or of the other players rag-
ing behind him, to get through his medi-
tations and the stroke inside, say, two
minutes or be penalised. There are some
of the same habit among the associates
also, and these are more difficult to deal
with than the he-male of the species,
since no golfing gent, can expostulate
adequately to a lady.

“Hutt”: In the M.L. championships
Wright, of Otago, captured the ama-
teur event, and Moss won the open after
a 36-hole play-off with another profes-
sional, Douglas. The evergreen Shaw
took the professional championship for
the third year in succession.
* * * *
“Shirley”: Australia having of late
produced several infant golf prodigies,
M.L. has evidently felt it up to it to
do likewise, for a 16-year-old lad named
Young, who looks about half his age,
shook the opposition up in the Dominion
championships. He got as far as the
semi-finals, in which he encountered H.
Black, who stopped his triumphant march.
Young, whose head just tops his club
bag, gets no great length off the tee, but
his timing is perfect and his short game
deadly accurate.

“Ballyhooly”: Golfers have been dis-
cussing the performance of Eric Fid-
dian in holing out in one at two
holes during the Irish amateur cham-
pionship. In spite of this rather upset-
ting performance, McLean, holder of the
title, went on to retain it by 3 and 2.
Duthie, a Vancouver professional, holed
out in one at two successive holes, the
second at over 200 yards. That was in
1911. One Bullock has struck out for a
new record by finding the pot with his
second. Playing for Bombay against
Poona on the latter club’s course, he
holed out his second shot at the 17th and
18th to bring him in a winner. Par for the
first hole was three, and for the second
four. In each case a mashie shot did
the trick.
Racquet and Bawl
Rupert Wertheim’s death in Melbourne
at 40 robs Australian lawn tennis of one
of its most picturesque personalities. The
old Melbourne Grammar boy’s great
height and tremendous reach made him
a formidable proposition on the courts,
while his delightful character and fine
sportsmanship ensured him the friend-
ship of everyone who came in contact
with him. A regular player for Victoria,
he also represented Australia in doubles
abroad in the 1922 Davis Cup tourney,
when he was called up, while on a visit
to Europe, to partner Pat Wood against
Czecho-Slovakia. He served with dis-
tinction in France with the A.1.F., and
in his later days helped a lot with the
administration of ths game in Victoria.
A fine billiard player, he was unique
among the open-air tennis cracks in this
country as a leading exponent of the
ancient “royal” game of tennis.
* * * *
“Top Spin”: Perry, Lee and Wilde, of
the English tennis team, landed in M.L.
last week. Hughes, who is coming the
other way, is to meet them in Sydney.
The visitors are expected on this side by
November 14, and will face Australia in
the first Test a fortnight later. Brookes,
Peach and Mathews will be the Austra-
lian selectors, but the team should prac-
tically pick itself. Each Test will con-
sist of eight singles and four doubles
“If you’d put your red lamp in the right place I wouldn’t have smashed into your
blasted barrier.”
“No need ter chew the rag, mister; I can put up another in a jiffy”
rubbers, the singles the best two out of
three sets, instead of the accepted Test-
match practice in other countries of three
of five sets. Each team will be of four
players.
* * * *
“Net B.”: When the tennis heads
allotted N.S.W. a Test match it offered
the same terms as were given to the other
States —40 p.c. of the gates without
guarantee against loss. The other States
acquiesced, but Ma stood out for 40
p.c. with a guarantee of 45 p.c. with-
out. The excuse made was that Ma had
spent some extra money on grandstands
—the same thing has been done in Mel-
bourne and Brisbane at least —and
wanted some of it back. The Australian
authorities thought it best to submit to
the extortion.
* * * *
“St. Colombes”: An echo of the Davis
Cup was heard last week when France,
playing against England in the covered
courts international match, beat the men
who defeated them in Paris. True, Perry
and Hughes were absent from the British
side, but the fact that Borotra gave Austin
a sound hiding in the singles after down-
ing Oliffe suggests that, if the Basque had
elected to play in the singles in the Davis
Cup challenge round in Paris, the pot
might not have crossed the Channel to
perfidious Albion.
Car and Cycle
“Anti-swank”: N.R.M.A. president
Watson has done both motorists and
pedestrians a service by inveighing
against the sporting type of car in which
the driver lies as if he were in bed and
has to crane his neck to see over the top
of the bonnet. Watson instanced a car
of this type in which visibility was
further obscured by a stout bar in the
middle of the wind-screen and a bulky
ventilating cowl on either flank. To drive
such a car on city street, country road or
racing track is courting disaster. The size
of such petrol-driven thunderbolts as Blue
Birds and Golden Arrows dwarfs the
driver in profile photographs, but he has
a clear view of his track and its surround-
ings, and insists upon having that clear
view though he has always at his disposal
a 200 yards wide beach, clear of all traf-
fic and obstacles. The first-class racing
driver has to be a good driver, and he
seldom, if ever, gets into trouble on the
road. But Apollo, Solomon and
rolled into one, would be nervous if
required to drive in any circumstances
some of the absurdities which may be
seen on city streets.
* * * *
“Richmond”: Dirt-track motor-cycle
racing promises to take on new life this
season, if the ambitions of the Autocycle
Union are realised. Victoria will send a
team of four riders to tour N.S.W. and
Queensland in December, and special
races are to be held to decide the per-
sonnel of the touring side. It is likely
that an Australian body will be formed
to control the interchange of teams
among the various speedways. At the
end of the season it is proposed to hold
an Australian championship in Mel-
bourne. In addition to local riders,
several leading British performers are
coming out on their own initiative and
others are to be invited.
“Hotham”: Australia’s big road races
for the pushbikers, the Warrnambool-
cum-Colac to Melbourne spins for pro-
fessionals and amateurs respectively, drew
big entries in both sections. The pro-
fessional event from Warrnambool was
especially interesting in that the winner,
Willoughby, of Coburg club, is the old-
est competitor to get his nose first over
the finishing line. Willoughby has turned
40, and has been competing for the last
23 years in the Dunlop-Perdriau
event; his previous best showing was
fifth place in 1931. With a start of 48
minutes Willoughby rode the 165 miles
in 7hr. smin. 55sec. The record is 6hr.
21min. 18sec. by Lamb last year. Fastest
time was done by Stuart, of Ormond,
with 6hr. 27min. 56 l-ssec. Hubert
Opperman, also on scratch, was two
minutes slower. The amateur go from
Colac —100 miles —was taken by the
Richmond rider Pearce, who, with a 37-
minute handicap, was clocked in at 4hr.
Bmin. 49sec. Fastest time, which in-
cludes the Victorian championship, went,
as all expected, to Milliken, of Coburg.
He won last year from scratch and
hoisted a world’s record in doing so.
This time his figures were 3hr. 51min.
44sec.
Miscellaneous
“Fleet Street” (London): Present Aus-
tralian Rugby League tourists are enjoy-
ing publicity in England in a sense never
achieved by earlier teams. The metro-
polis has usually given the cold shoulder
to the Northern game (except for the Cup
final at Wembley), but the manage-
ment’s dodge of bringing the troupe to
London first has aroused a little enthusi-
asm for the code. Critchley, the Can-
adian who launched the dogs and motor-
cycle speedways on London, hopes that
the League will conquer the south in five
years. London will next season see the
League game regularly, for Critchley has
transplanted Wigan Highfield to London,
with the floodlit White City as its home
ground.
* * * *
The Wallabies were welcomed back
by the N.S.W.R.U. at a dinner in
Sydney. The affair was marked with
a tinge of sadness, since the players
themselves were parting brass rags after
many months of camaraderie, while the
many lights of other days who helped
to illuminate the occasion were almost
as downcast at the prospect of such a
fine body of young Australian sportsmen
ceasing to exist as an organisation.
* * * *
“Hotham”: Through the Australian
Swimming Union the British Empire
Games controllers have offered £lOOO to-
wards expenses of an Aussie team. It
should provide for the fares of at least
14 competitors, while a fortnight’s free
board before the gathering will be pro-
vided in London. The team will pro-
bably be made up of eight swimmers,
four athletes, a boxer and a wrestler.
** ■ *
“Barcoot”: Horseshoe-pitching used
to be a favorite Sunday recreation among
station hands and at the shearing sheds
in the days of long ago, though one hears
little of it now. Practically quoits played
with shoes instead of the familiar steel
rings, it is a highly-organised sport in
the United States, where the world’s
championship was recently held in
Chicago. There were 71 entrants,
men and women, each sex having
its own championship. The “courts”
were elaborately equipped, and the game
was for 100 pitches, three points for a
ringer and one for a pitch within 6in.
of the stake. The winner was Theodore
Allen, who put up a world’s record with
73.5 p.c. of ringers. The elder of two
sisters named Schultz won the women’s
title with 211 ringers in 286 throws, the
younger being runner-up.


A GALLERY OF GOLFERS.
No. 10.
Browsing Round Brisbane G.C.
Brisbane Golf Club was founded in
1896 by a dozen addicts who started a
nine-hole course at Chelmer, some way
out of Brisbane, on the Ipswich railway.
The first president was Lord Lamington,
then State Governor; the first secre-
tary, J. R. (Jack) Gair, a founder and
still a member. Chelmer was a fast-
growing suburb, and, after several ex-
periences of new cottages blossoming in
a night on the fairways, the pioneers
decided to shift down river to Yeerong-
pilly.
There, in 1904, they found a haven
closer to town. Membership then was
under three figures, but to-day stands at
over 600. The club owns 140 acres free-
hold on open rolling country dotted with
tea-tree swamps here and there, and
there are two courses —eighteen- and
nine-hole.
Brisbane is the oldest club in the
metropolis, and for 30 years was the
only one. There is a comfortable, old-
fashioned, wooden clubhouse which has
been added to from time to time as the
family grew, much on the lines of the old
western station homesteads.
From the beginning importance of ex-
pert instruction was recognised. There
were two Scottish professionals attached
in the early days, and Joe Kirkwood and
D. G. Soutar have also enlisted under
the Brisbane banner. The man in charge
at present is Mick Stafford. Brisbane
takes turn about with Royal Queens-
land in holding the State championships.
It lives in hope that one day the Aus-
tralian titles will be contested on its
course.
Charley Mant, whom Frith presents
first of his fellows, is one of the
original members and a well-known
Brisbane mercantile agent. His polo days
are far behind, but he is a goodish per-
former at the footslogging game, as his
10 handicap indicates. D. A. Lavery is
divided in his allegiance. In winter the
club claims him for a good game of golf
off the 15 mark. In summer the surf
and sailing of Moreton Bay are apt to
seduce him away. Public accountancy
is one of his interests in life.
Third comes E. G. Herring, a recent
convert to the game. He is an extra-
good beginner, having cut his handicap
in a few months from 25 to 15 ; this is
explained, perhaps, by the fact that he
is often found on the links carolling with
the magpies in the dawn. He is a public
accountant with Inglis and Lavery when
not so engaged. Colin Thompson is one
of the low-markers. In 1931 he gave
the mighty Ivo Whitton a hard gallop
for the State amateur title. Insurance
is his business.
Arthur Midson, otherwise “The Ad-
miral,” is, in his eighth decade, the
G.O.M. of the club. In spite of his
years, he still plays his regular three
rounds a week and is a capable left-
hander off the 20 mark. An ex-captain of
Brisbane, he is a retired master builder.
A. H. Dinsdale is No. 6. A fairly new
member but a most promising one, he
is already one of those players on whom
the handicapper keeps a wary eye lifted.
Seventh we see A. J. Dolby. A director
of McWhirter’s, he is a golfer of the
keenest, and his handicap of 15 pro-
claims him a player not to be trifled
with.
Looming behind Dolby is D. K.
Paine, who needs a partner and two
caddies to look him from head to foot
when he stretches himself. An architect,
he is very popular in spite of his capacity
for criticising. He has even been com-
menting on his own handicap of late.
W. H. Drew is a Scot of the Scots, so
his handicap of 5 will not surprise the
knowing ones. He was pipped on the
post for the club championship this year.
He, too, is a director of McWhirter’s.
Tenth in order is knight Edward Mac-
artney, a trustee and an ex-president of
Brisbane. A solicitor, his career in Queens-
land politics and as Agent-General for
the State is too well known to recapitu-
late. He is also a director of the “Courier-
Mail.” A very useful golfer on the
12 mark, he is a four-ball habitue.
W. F. R. Boyce, who comes close on
the ex-president, nowadays sports some
silver threads among the golden locks
which distinguished him in his Charters
Towers days. He won the State amateur
championship as long ago as 1915 and
is still a dangerous man on 6. He was
formerly captain, and has been a member
of the State Golf Council since 1914. A
solicitor by profession. The round dozen
is made up by J. F. Archibald, who for
years held an inter-State reputation as a
bowler. His change-over from rolling
up a bowl to hitting along a ball with
a crooked stick finds him on the 20
mark.
Knight James Blair, Chief Justice of
Queensland, and known to all speaking
the language of that land as “Jimmy,”
in spite of his formidable wig, is another
member of Brisbane who has cut a wide
swath in politics and law. He was first
initiated to golf when a law student with
the aid of an old walking-stick and a
veteran golf ball brought from over-
seas. His handicap of 25 suggests that
he has improved something on those
days. In the club, as in all other places,
one of the best-liked of men.
No. 14 is G. M. Archibald, captain of
Brisbane and a mighty worker in its in-
terests. A most consistent player, he has
been leniently treated by the handicapper
with 12. He is connected with the
Dominion Flour Mills in his business
hours. Sam Little, on No. 15, was a solid
worker on the committee for years and,
though he can still hold down a 9 handi-
cap, does not play as often as he should.
He is an authoritative writer on golf.
On his heels comes C. B. Freeman,
runner-up to J. M. Banks in the State
amateur championship of 1929. A fine
player on a 5 handicap, he is apt to have
his off days. A dentist by profession.
D. A. McNab, 17th in the gallery, is a
member of a firm of solicitors which is
almost as old as Queensland. He is an
ex-captain, modest as to his golf. Never-
theless, his handicap of 6 shows that his
Scottish ancestry has not been without
avail.
Eighteenth from the left we have R. L.
(Bob) Wishart. He is known in the
club as the “official warbler” on account
of his fine voice, which is only one of
his many musical gifts. Very popular,
and a nasty man to stack up against on
the 16 mark. On the 19th stand comes
secretary T. B. (Tom) Hunter. He is
also handicapper, but holding down the
troublesome double never seems to faze
him. Winner of the State amateur title
in 1913, he has little time for playing
nowadays. A solicitor, he is chairman
of directors of the “Telegraph.”
W. N. Harrison, chasing his secretary,
is a comparatively new convert, and
has already reached the 6-handicap class.
He was a Rhodes scholar, and was
called to the Bar recently. J. T.
Radcliffe is the present open champion
of Queensland, and an amateur title-
holder on several occasions. Probably
the , best golfer Bananaland has yet
produced, he also is an ex-Rhodesian,
and is assistant head at Southport School,
a Queensland G.P.S. foundation. A
great tennis player to boot if golf had
not claimed him. Mick Stafford is in
a class by himself as a teacher of the
game. R. C. Stephens is a keen and
popular member. One hopes that Frith
has not caught him in the act of making
the best of his lie, though it looks like it.
Away from golf he manages Gollin and
Co., general merchants.
J. H. G. Blakeney is a director of
Finney Isles and a notably cheery per-
sonality. His handicap of 21 would sug-
gest that he needs to be if he still persists
with golf. F. R. Gilson is the 25th and
last figure to flash on the screen. . An
erratic player at times, he is capable of
very high-class golf. Handicapper Tom
Hunter is of the same opinion, for F.R.
plays off the 4 mark. The Ebbw Vale
Brick Co. claims him when not golfing.

STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
LICE ON SHEEP.
“Valerin”: Lice are prevalent among
sheep in N. S. Wales. It is up to the P.P.
Boards to enforce compulsory dipping in
infected areas. The Railway Depart-
ment can help by sterilising sheep-vans.
If you have any doubt about sheep being
lousy watch if they rub up against trees,
stumps or fencing-posts, or if the wool
bears a shaggy appearance along the sides,
caused by rubbing. The favorite place
for lice is about the shoulders and inside
the thighs.
* * * *
“X.T.”: Only arsenical-powder dips of
high merit will destroy lice on sheep and
entirely prevent reinfestation. If your
sheep are lice-infested, dip them in
arsenical powder as soon as shear cuts
have healed. This will not ensure the
flocks against reinfestation, as there is
not enough wool on the sheep to lake
out of the bath sufficient dip to afford
protection. If you subject sheep to the
risk of fresh infestation, dip them again
about two months after the first dipping.
Lice breed rapidly. Don’t allow too
much time to elapse between shearing
and dipping. It gives the lice a chance
to damage the fleece, seriously affect the
condition of the sheep and infest the
lambs. Attend to these essential points:
(1) Use carefully, according to directions, an
arsenical powder of high reputation.
(2) Stir the bath from the bottom through-
out the operation and keep the sheep in the
bath long enough to soak it to the skin.
(3) After the dipping, keep the sheep in the
shade until it dries thoroughly.
(4) Dip all the sheep at the same muster.
BREEDING MAXIMS.
“Jumbuck”: Culling out the nonde-
script types is essential, but some ewes,
which appear to be all right, may lower
the standard of the flock if allowed to
breed. Consider these points:
(1) Never breed from immature sheep; the
future sizes of the flock will become too small
in the frames.
(2) Cull out all ewes with wasty or mushy
backs, or any cutting light- or short-stapled
fleeces.
(3) Use only sound rams of a type that will
nick with the particular class of ewes ; rams
that are adaptable to withstand climatic con-
ditions and able to impart to their progeny
their own desirable features.
(4) Give both the ewes and rams a chance;
have one lambing a year.
BRANDING SHEEP.
“Jumbuck”: Too many graziers per-
sist in using tar for branding after shear-
ing, believing that they lose nothing by
the tar being in the wool, and that it
stays there in all weathers. Tar in wool
is a source of annoyance when scouring,
and the industry suffers because of its
use. Many good branding fluids, which
have lasting color and readily scour out,
leaving no deleterious effect on the wool,
are on the market. The strong liquor
needed to get tar out leaves the wool
harsh.
Legislation to prohibit the use of tar
for wool-branding is needed.
CONSERVE FODDER.
“Junee”: While values for cereals
are low and wool keeps improving, stock
up with sheep and use the plants for
producing supplies of fodder to meet
droughts. Fodder can be conserved
cheaply in many ways. Silage in pits is
cheapest and safest; any crop can be
used, but you will get best results from
wheat which has been heavily seeded and
not allowed to grow to more than 3ft.
Ensilage is not a complete food ; supple-
ment it with grain.
Oats is the best cereal. Store it in
silos to protect it from mice, rats and
other pests. Hay, preferably wheaten or
“shandygaff” (mixture of wheat, and oat),
makes a good change. Keep straw fine
and short; do not cut the crop until the
grain has formed. Build stacks on mice-
proof straddles, and protect them from
the weather. Sow a patch of lucerne in
autumn, and cultivate it freely to keep
weeds in check. Top-dress it with super.
occasionally.
MITCHELL GRASS.
“Desert Pea”: Dr. E. Hirschfeld has
been addressing western members of
Queensland’s Parliament on the need for
extending the distribution of Mitchell
grass (B. 4/10/’33). He advocates allow-
ing the grass to seed, which can only be
brought about by subdivision of pad-
docks. The pastoralists cannot be ex-
pected to do this without compensation,
As Dr. Hirschfeld says, “the preservation
G f Mitchell grass and the extension of the
area in which it grows are matters which
concern not only the pastoralist but the
whole nation.”
Mitchell grass roots, which have been
f oun d 30ft. deep, reach layers of the soil
w hi c h are practically independent of
droughts. Those roots enable the grass
to SU ppiy vitamins when there are no
ot h er s in sight.
FROM WHEAT TO GRAZING.
, |Ces have recov .
ered B and wheat pril f es are at depres-
gion leye j it is sugges ted that farmers
drier districts should turn over their
paddocks to grazing.
L. Judd, manager of Temora Expert-
menta) Farm, in a paper at the Agric.
Bureau Conference at Weethalle
(N.S.W.), gave the following advice:
Sow the last crop of wheat on the land
to be spelled with 21b. to 31b. of Wim-
mera rye-grass seed per acre, mixed with
superphosphate. During the next har-
vest, the rye-grass seed will be taken into
the header, blown out again, and dis-
tributed evenly over the paddock. By
doing this an excellent pasture may be
established in one season.
PINEAPPLE-PLANTING.
“N.C.”: Close planting of pineapples,
about 24,000 to the acre, is the new prac-
tjce j n H awa n, Actual farm results of
trials on Queensland’s North Coast do
not favor it. In the usual dry spring,
plants suffer. Fruit is often delayed six
mon th s? while cultivating costs still go on.
Other disadvantages are the increased
labor needed to keep young plants clean,
the ,? <^’ { fSjS!%t a^?on i 2£ r tos
and greater liability to fungoid
disease. Ev ? n if g. reater production per
ac . re is achieved, increased costs offset
tb is. Serious marketing problems must
be s ° lved be Jj* e increased Production
can be welcomed
nlaT ,. rJ
BANANA-GROWIN .
“Johnno”: November is usually the
best month for banana-planting. The
weather is warm enough for the planted
suckers to move straightway, and it is
late enough in the season to prevent the
first bunches from appearing in the
winter, which is undesirable. November
planting ensures a vigorous growth of
first suckers, which will make their
appearance when the ground has an
abundant supply of moisture.
The banana needs a lot of mois-
ture. Do not attempt its cultivation as
a means of livelihood in a district of
low or erratic rainfall. Suckers planted
in November should reach the fruiting
stage when conditions are favorable for
big bunches, which should mature when
prices are firm.
The first suckers to come away pro-
duce the largest bunches. Early planting
(August and September) is safe only in
North Queensland, where bananas come
into bearing only seven months after
planting. In other parts the usual time
is 12 to 14 months. When planting
suckers trim away all roots close to the
bulb, and cut back the tops of the plants.
Tramp down the ground until it is firm.
Make the holes 12in. to 16in. deep,
according to the texture of the soil. Set
the plants deeper in light, sandy soils.
NURSING SICK ANIMALS.
“Hatter”: Sick animals need dry, well-
ventilated quarters free from draughts,
judicious clothing, frequent light meals
and plenty of cold, fresh water.
Cover a feverish animal with enough
light, dry clothing to keep it warm with-
out inducing undue perspiration. Wrap
a horse’s legs in cotton-wool and band-
age them to counteract coldness in the.
extremities. Fasten a piece of old
blanket to a pig’s back, with holes cut
for its front legs. Groom when the
animal is well. Otherwise remove the
clothing once a day and rub the body
gently with a soft cloth. Sponge the
mouth, nostrils, eyes and forehead with
tepid water, and in cases of pneumonia
cleanse the nostrils frequently. Avoid
mechanical feeding. It leads to digestive
troubles. Be sure the feeding-box is
clean and placed at a convenient height.
Never leave food lying in it.
For bran mash, put 31b. of bran in a
well-scalded bucket and scald with 2|
pints boiling water. Cover, leave for
20min. and give when cool. A little salt
and honey or treacle make it more
acceptable, but it will not be relished if
given often.
Gruel is likewise good for horses. Place
lib. of oatmeal in lgal. of cold water
and allow it to simmer until it thickens.
Linseed tea, made by boiling lib. of
linseed in a muslin bag in 2gal. of water
and straining when soft, is also useful.
During convalescence give small amounts
of oats prepared by boiling or steaming,
and also small quantities of grass, car-
rots or potatoes.
Cattle are less fastidious. They need
coarse material, such as hay, chaff or
pulped roots, for satisfactory digestion.
Cure scours in calves by withholding food
for a day and giving during that time
boiled water every three hours. Give sick
pigs milk with a little barley or oatmeal.
If there is lung trouble give them i-pint
of linseed tea. A sick sheep will probably
refuse liquid food, so give it grass, sloppy
bran oatmeal gruel or scalded hay. If
there is digestive trouble avoid roots.
Don’t give raw meat to sick dogs, but
milk, beef tea and rabbit jellies. In
digestive troubles white of egg and cus-
tards are also good.
Suitable feeding, clean surroundings,
care and management to prevent chills
and attention to mineral requirements are
the four essentials needed to keep ani-
mals in good health. Disease is apt to
occur when the vitality is lowered
through neglect of one of these precau-
tions.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“A.C.8.”: Celery culture would be
profitable to many gardeners who waste
time on cabbages and beans. White
Plume, one of the best varieties, pro-
duces excellent heads of fine flavor and
whiteness.
“Dai R.”: Watch your orange-trees
for borers. They show up during
November. Their presence is indicated
by the wilting of shoots. When you’ve
pruned examine the piece taken off to
see if you’ve got the nest. If not go
farther till you locate it. Burn all cut-
aways to ensure destruction of larvae.
November to May is the worst period.
“Sheepo”: When three-quarter-woolled
sheep are weak, with little prospect of
picking up, take off the fleece. The loss
in wool weight will be made up the next
year because of earlier shearing, and the
weak sheep will improve in condition.
In normal weather the oldest of weak
sheep will pick up after being shorn ; it
is better to get nine months’ or even less
growth of wool and save sheep than have
neither.
“Cebib”: Stump roots and gibbers
have ruined many ploughshares, but
when ploughing sandy soil, which bore
evidence of marine formation a South
Coast (N.S.W.) farmer had his share dis-
abled by a large pumice stone. It took
two men to. lift it.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
{Transferred from Service Department .)
(1) 1 wish to fatten a number of aged wethers ‘
this summer. What is a suitable fattening crop
which could be raised on new ground in quick
time —something that would stand a good deni
of feeding off ? The soil is a light-reddish
loam. (2) Much has been said about Mitchell
grass. Is it suitable for our district (Miles, Q.) ■
I am looking for some grass or grasses to lay
down as permanent pastures. Would either-
Mitchell or Rhodes grass be of value ? (3)
Could you suggest a mixture of grasses and
herbage suitable for laying down permanent,
pastures? I want a mixture capable of supply-
ing, good winter feed for ewes. —8368.
(1) Sudan grass is the hardiest and most
suitable summer-growing crop for grazing pur-,
poses in your district. It is a risky crop u .
grazed when immature, as would have to be
done when grown lor sheep. Thousands ol
acres are sown with Sudan grass throughout
Darling Downs and Maranoa districts each year.
Although these are grazed in all stages ol
growth an occasional serious loss of stock from ,
poisoning occurs and the danger, although not
great under normal weather conditions, always
exists. (2) Try Mitchell grass in an experimental
way at first. Rhodes grass, particularly if
sown on land that had had even a rough cul-
tivation, would be the most suitable artificial
grass. (3) Owing to lack of reliable winter
rains it would be very difficult to suggest any
mixture of grasses and clovers which would be
likely to give results, except under the most
favorable conditions. Prairie grass is one which
would be well worth trying. <
Method of preserving galvanised wire-netting
from rust ? Netting used in floodgates becomes
useless in nine months. —B3Bo.
Good results have been got from black
varnishing one end of netting after gal-
vanising, in cases where the bottom of the
netting fence is trenched into the ground.
This counteracts the corrosive action set up t /
certain impurities in the soil. In the case under
review it is doubtful whether this dressing would
be of any real benefit.
My draught mare has developed a greyish-
blue spot in the centre of the eye. It seems to
be spreading. What is the trouble and can
it be prevented from blinding her ? —8327.
Apparently the affected eye has an opacity
of the corner, the transparent membrane of the
eye having been replaced by a white film as a
result of inflammation. The application of a
2\ p.c. solution of sulphate of zinc two to
three times daily will usually check this condi-
tion in the early stages.
(1) What are the prospects for mixed fruit-
and vegetable-growing in western Queensland ?
(2) What area would be suitable for a one-man
show ? (3) Under what circumstances is such
land obtainable ? (4) Minimum capital neces-
sary for a bedrock start ? (5) Can you suggest
a suitable locality? —B34s.
(1) Prospects are good if suitable land and
water are available. (2) Not less than 10 acres.
(3) Probably the land would have to be pur-
chased from private holders. (4) Approximately
£3OO, though the amount might vary quite a
lot according to local conditions. (5) The best
markets are to be obtained adjacent to a city.
Is it a fact that Rhodes grass does not seed
in America or S. Africa ? (2) Is seed exported
from Australia to these countries ? (3) Names of
exporting firms in Sydney or Melbourne ? (4)
Trice paid per pound for prime seed for export ?
—8355.
(1) No. Rhodes grass was first introduced from
South Africa per medium of seed. (2) Probably
to America, but unlikely, as South Africa is in
direct communication with U.S.A. (3) and (4)
Apply Yates and Co., Sydney, for possible in-
formation. Apparently you are ■ confusing
Rhodes grass with kikuyu. So far, no instance
of seed being produced by that grass (at least,
in Australia) is on record.
A draught mare, seven years, developed a
number of small hard lumps on shoulder, just
below where the collar touches, early last
summer. After working throughout the year
they have formed into two hard, fairly large
lumps on bottom of shoulder. —8363.
The injury is caused by a loose or a tight
collar, with resultant friction. This can be recti-
fied with strips of material, or made wider by
wetting it and stretching on a block.
What are the stages of the blowfly ? How
long does it take to mature ? —8561.
Leaflets dealing with this question are out of
print. Information available is incorporated in
“The Sheep Blowfly Problem,” a bulletin of 138
pages, published in January, 1933, by the Joint
Blowfly Committee of the C.S.I.R. and the
N.S.W. Department of Agriculture (price, Is.
6d.). There are at least six species of sheep
blowflies and some other related flies which
rarely attack sheep. The most important sheep
blowfly is the green Lucilia cuprina. This fly
lays its eggs on meat or sheep; the eggs hatch
to produce white maggots; the latter feed vigor-
ously until full grown. They then burrow in
the soil and form a kind of hard brown chrysalis,
inside the shell of which the adult fly develops.
Finally, the fly pushes its way out of the case,
through the soil and flies away. It feeds on the
nectar of flowers and on the exudate from meat.
The time taken in the various stages depends on
the temperature, and the shortest larval life is
found on the living sheep. In warm summer
conditions the average times taken in meat may
be said to be: Eggs to hatch, J day; maggot
feeding, 3-4 days; maggot resting, 2 days; pupa,
4-5 days; average egg-adult (warmest condi-
tions), 10-12 days. The adult lives for about
six days before it is sexually mature. After
that the female may live for as long as 90 days
and produce more than 2000 eggs. Cool
weather prolongs the various immature stages.

The “Coo-ee” Auto-Oiled
Windmill is Strongly Built,
Mechanically Efficient and
very Smooth Running. It is
completely Self-Oiling. The
Gears and Shafts run in oil and
a constant stream of oil flows
wherever lubrication is needed.
The “Coo-ee” has double Steel Gears, perfectly balanced; these,
with the Two Pitmans, lift the load vertically without the least
side strain. The Turntable is Self-Oiling and the Mill pivots easily,
thus quickly righting itself in changing winds. The Special Design
of the Windwheel, added to the many other special features and
Perfect Lubrication throughout, makes the “Coo-ee Auto-Oiled
Windmill very responsive to Light Breezes and yet it will run safely
in a gale. One oiling will last a year and the Auto-Oiled “Coo-ee’
will practically take care of itself day and night throughout the
year, without attention.
The “Coo-ee” Band Brake is most efficient and effectually holds
the Mill.
The “Coo-ee” is an ideal Mill for the Man on the Land and the
price is considerably less than those of our Billabong Models.

The Wool Markets
“Anthony”: The last week has been a
week of selling in lesser centres —Bris-
bane and Adelaide (not so much less),
Albury, Newcastle and so on. All of
them report full clearances at firm prices.
Adelaide, in fact, put up something in
the way of a record with only 87 bales
passed in out of a total offering of over
10,000. The general level of prices is
par to 5 p.c. higher than it was, say,
two to three weeks ago and 5 p.c. to
1\ p.c. cheaper than it was two to three
weeks before that. These levels are con-
firmed by all sales, and so far no sign
of nervousness has crept in on the buy-
ing side of the trade, a contingency
bound to occur if prices attain to unsafe
levels. The comparatively reasonable
range of values operates towards con-
tinued firmness of price and demand.
Bradford tops, which are a good baro-
meter, are quoted at firm prices. Yarn
orders in the milling centres are free at
prices satisfactory to the makers, so it
certainly appears that trade is good.
* * * *
Probably the only wool-selling centre
whose business does not conform to the
best elements of price and clearance is
the one at Newcastle. Except for a few
approaches to the real thing, the average
level of its transactions is below that of
the parent selling centres. Considering
the superior general character of the
offerings which are available there, the
average price should be at a premium
over Sydney to be at full parity.
* * * *
Newcastle has had bad luck. Its first
trading efforts synchronised with the be-
ginnings of the depression and the col-
lapse of wool values. A year or two
before, when the trade was wool-hungry,
it would have been difficult to restrain
buyers from patronising the new market.
As things fell out, many have refrained
from attending the sales at Newcastle,
nor are they likely to attend so long as
offerings continue on a small basis.
Buyers get an average daily offering of
about 12,000 bales in the central markets,
where the seat of their operations and
their offices are ; they are not likely to
go out of their way to Newcastle for
2000 or 3000 bales if they do not get
them cheap. Growers of the north and
north-west of N. S. Wales have been
told before, and they might as well be
told again, that, if they believe in the de-
centralisation of marketing, and they
think Newcastle will help, it is their job
to put it on the map as a wool-selling
centre. So far, their efforts, except in a
few individual cases, do not excite much
enthusiasm.
* * * *
The success of the wool industry in
Australia has been occasioned by men
who did things for themselves. Some
people think it absurd for a clip equal
to that of Victoria, and greater than that
of Queensland, to be hauled through one
deep-sea port to another 100 miles further
on. Yet such are the dimensions of the
clip which is yearly hauled through
Newcastle. However, other influences
besides freights must be considered.
Wool Averages
Brokers have been publishing averages
of prices realised for wool sold in the
market, average per pound and average
per bale. They are for everything from
coarse crossbred to fine merino, from
locks to super combings, from dusty,
burry, thinly-grown western wools to
light, dry, fine Moree wools. Naturally
some clips go a lot above the general
average, others a lot below. Early-
shorn wools, on account of their gener-
ally dusty, burry condition, will average
less than the later-shorn cold-country
wools. Why then should the owner of
one of the latter class of clips sell his
wool in the shed because he is offered
the same as to-day’s average or possibly
a very little extra? The late-shearing
woolgrower knows or should know that,
given an even market, his wool will
realise a better average than the early-
shorn wool. Banks accept this fact as
a basis for land values. Why should the
grower walk round it?
Wheat Expedients
“The Chiel”: The wheat position is
becoming more obscure as harvest-time
approaches. The Melbourne conference
and Parliamentary debates have done
little to clear the way. All are unani-
mous that “something” must be done.
The solutions offered cover a wide range.
Some want a pool, some a bonus ; others
want a flour tax or a guaranteed price,
but opinions differ as to the price needed.
Nothing is clear. Even the exportable
surplus can only be guessed.
* * * *
Nock, M.H.R., is among those who
want a pool, grower-controlled ; but
growers have made money without any
pool. Premier Butler, of S.A., says the
international agreement “may involve us
in the creation of a huge Commonwealth
pool to control exports, leading ulti-
mately to the nationalisation of the indus-
try.” Have the pro-poolites considered
that aspect? How is a pool going to add
one farthing to the world’s market price?
It boils down to squeezing a higher price
out of the local consumer. But how
hard are we going to squeeze? What
price does the grower need to make his
industry pay?
* * * *
Thorby, M.H.R., says “a price of 3s. a
bushel for this year’s wheat will not re-
turn the cost of production to farmers.”
How does he know? The actual cost of
production has never been satisfactorily
determined, nor can it be when it varies
almost with each individual grower.
Some average 20 bushels to the acre,
others only 10. Is the local consumer
to subsidise lax farming methods by pay-
ing a price which will show a profit to
the 10-bushel man? If not, what price
is he going to be asked to pay?
* * * *
To all these queries, what is the an-
swer? It would seem to be “increase
the average-per-acre yield.” It can be
done. If Australia reduced its normal
production by half it would have little
or no effect on the world position, but
the effect on Australia would be serious.
Rather should Australia increase its pro-
duction, not by putting a greater area
under crop, but by a greater per-acre
yield. This is the surest way of reducing
production costs.
* * * *
No country will continue to grow
wheat at a loss. Artificial bolstering up
can be only a temporary expedient. This
applies particularly to those hitherto im-
porting countries which are now supply-
ing their own requirements because of
bounty-inflated prices to the growers.
Obviously the present position cannot
last indefinitely, and the country with
the greatest resources, and resourceful-
ness, will make the quickest recovery.
Australia must take stock of the possi-
bilities and discard areas which cannot
be made to produce profitably under
existing conditions. Meantime, of course,
the grower must be helped, and distribu-
tion of the proceeds from a sales tax on
flour seems the best way of helping him.
Butter Falls Further
“8.5.”: London butter prices continue
to slump. Australian choicest is now back
in the nineties, cabled advice quoting 965.,
with prospects of further easing. The
Danish brands, however, have firmed
3s. a cwt., after falling 14s. in three
weeks. This improvement is said to be
due to an increased Continental de-
mand ; at all events, the f.o.b. price
has risen from 925. to 98s. After pay-
ing landing charges and duty at ISsT 'a
cwt. the spot value should work out at
about 118 s. France is said to be short
of supply. Her import quota has thus
been raised. This allows a larger quan-
tity of Danish butter to find its way
there.
* * * *
Statistically, there is no reason for the
jaundiced tone of the overseas market.
Sales of Australian have improved by
2000 boxes, while our unsold consign-
ments are modest. Even M.L., which
all through the year has carried heavy
stocks in London, recorded a drop last
week of 49,000 boxes. As against that,
her butter afloat, and that for which
shipping space has been booked, are
steadily growing. Her butter exports for
the first week of the current month—
-3587 tons —show an increase of 1133
tons on a year ago. Australia’s offerings
for the same period were down 812 tons
on those of last year.
* * * *
Due to the general drop in the whole-
sale rate, the retail butter price in the
U.K. dropped one penny last week, Em-
pire makes selling at Is. a lb. U.K.
butter arrivals are showing the usual
seasonal increase, and are 1800 tons up
on the previous week’s receipts. Can-
adian butter has again made its appear-
ance, and cow-fat from Russia is drib-
bling in. The last batch of the latter
totalled 1600 tons, or one-fifth of J. Bull’s
weekly requirements. It is not sold
under the Lenin brand, but is blended
with other imported butters—very often
Australian.
* * * *
As a result of depressed values over-
seas, Australian local prices continue to
tumble. For the second week running
N.S.W., Vic. and Tassie have reduced
their official quotations, the last spasm
being fd. a lb. A week previously a
cut of Id. was made, so within three
weeks the dairy-farmer has lost over 16s.
a cwt. Queensland last week dropped
Id. a lb. Her market rate is now 1405.,
or 9s. 2d. over N.S.W. and 18s. Bd. over
Vic. and Tassie. Vic.’s minimum c.i.f.
and e. level remains at 89s. a cwt., which
is equivalent to 1295. lOd. f.0.b., inclusive
of stabilisation bounty. If the latter figure
is a true forecast of values overseas in
six weeks’ time, Vic.’s local market of
121 s. 4d. is nearly Id. below the f.o.b.
value. For the last two or three weeks
business at the figure fixed by the Export
Board has been impossible. London
buyers’ ideas of the forward price are
shillings below 89s.
* * * *
For some time a large section of the
Export Board has played with the idea
of prohibiting spot sales. According to
this section safety can only be found in
the adoption of a consignment policy.
But certain of the supporting factories
insist on the butter being sold. To them
to consign means the probable risk of
heavy reclamations, especially on a fall-
ing market. It was bad policy from the
point of the agents handling these fac-
tories’ outputs to labor the necessity of
prohibiting spot sales. The board de-
cided on a compromise, which took the
form of the weekly fixation of a mini-
mum price for c.i.f. and e. and f.o.b.
sales. To-day’s levels are too high. Sup-
porters of spot sales claim that the board,
while not prohibiting such sales, is actu-
ally doing so by making an unsaleable
price.
Control of Fruit Export
“Yeb”: C. J. Parnham, a Melbourne
fruit-exporter, has returned from U.K.,
where, he says, only 250,000 cases were
sold'out of an export total of 1,061,000
cases of apples sent from Australia. He
says the industry is in such a deplorable
state that an inter-State committee is
needed to arrange quantities and ports
of destination. There is a super-
fluity of shippers, the number of whom
he wants reduced, because the growers
are working independently. Unwanted
varieties of fruit can only be prevented
from going abroad by an authorised body.
A board could handle all Government
grants and negotiate with shipping cos.
At a conference to be held in Sydney
on November 14 N.S.W. growers will
propose that a control board be estab-
lished. N.S.W. growers agree with Parn-
ham in general principles, and if Tas-
manian and other growers are wise they
cannot help but agree. There must be
an export standard in fruit, as in every
other commodity.
Times Change
“8.5. E.”: Oatmeal and whisky are no
longer the Scot’s chief articles of diet.
He has acquired an appetite for flour,
and, to satisfy it, Australia, for six
months of the present year, supplied
him with 364,594 cwt., or 34 per cent, of
his total imports. Canada, however,
skimmed the cream of the business
with 615,354 cwt., while the land of
the wooden ham filled the gap with
63,598 cwt. The Clyde Trust is to be
thanked for a good deal of our flour
trade.
J. Bull Buys Our Wine
“D.R.Y.”: J. Bull’s taste for alcohol
is catholic. In addition to his native
tipple, with its infusion of hops, and the
large quantity of whisky which he drew
from Scotland, he required over 7,660,000
gallons of wine to quench his thirst dur-
ing the first seven months of this year.
This meant good business for Australia,
which exported 2,024,419 gallons to
J. Bull. Australian wine is becoming a
firm: favorite with J.B. The amount
mentioned shows a growth of 785,600
gallons over Australian supplies sent him
two years ago.
Farm-made Butter
“X.T.”: If “Fodgie” (B. 20/9/’33)
lived in N.S.W. he would have been paid
the full amount of the cream supplied
to his factory, not as butter-fat, but in
terms of commercial butter. He would
not have made a present of 22 p.c. over-
run to his factory, as in the Ma State
the cream supplier must be paid the full
amount of butter which his cream makes.
N.S.W. legislation is ahead of that of
other States, as no factory, proprietary
or co-operative, can get away with an
overrun of 22 p.c.; its suppliers’ accounts
are subject to a strict audit by dairy in-
spectors, who see that the factory pays
for every scrap of raw material sup-
plied. While farm-made butter may not
affect the quality of factory butter, it
does affect its sale ; the amount which
it displaces has to be shipped overseas,
and on that the dairy farmers of Australia
voluntarily pay a bounty of 3d. a pound,
financed through a levy to which the
home-made article has never contri-
buted. Under the regulations of the
Commerce Act farm-made butter cannot
be exported ; all butter shipped overseas
has to be pasteurised.
* * * *
“8.F.”: “J.M.” (B. 20/9/’33) is wrong
in his figures. In butter exported last
season Queensland scored 354 per cent,
choicest, Vic. 55 and N.S.W. 84. As a
Bananalander, I know the limitations
placed on the quality of our butter
through long distances and a semi-tropi-
cal climate, but I think that during the
coming season we will show an improve-
ment that will make some of our south-
ern critics take notice. Agriculture Min-
ister Bulcock is a tiger for efficiency, and
butter-factory managers will have to
deliver the goods ; if not, he will want
to know why.
M.L. food prices, on the average, have
been lower this year than last, a fact
which has contributed to the improved
state of the U.K. market. The clothing
and footwear trades are the only trades
in M.L. in which prices are higher.
With the recorded improvement in export
values M.L. is justified in looking for-
ward to better times.

“Rajasthan”: The comment on sut-
tee (B. 13/ 9/ ’33) reminds me that the
word as used in Hind applies, not to
the rite itself, but to the woman devot-
ing herself to it. Once she made her
declaration she became the “Sati” and
was only referred to by that name.
“Suttee,” to use the Anglicised form,
was of two kinds and bore two titles.
The first was used when the widow
shared the pyre with her husband and
was called “dying in company with.”
The second, “dying in accordance with,”
took place when the husband died at a
distance, as in battle, and his body was
not available. In this case the devotee
took into the flames with her her hus-
band’s turban or some other personal
property of his. It is worth noting that
Brahmin women were specially ex-
empted from the rite, though the men
supervised the ceremonies and charged
fees for doing so.

When Lord Beauchamp was in Tahiti
he lived in a thatched-grass house, built
in the Samoan manner. This was six
miles out of Papeete, and had been put
up by Murnau, the German film pro-
ducer, when he was directing “Tabu.”
Poor Murnau now is dead, and his aged
mother in Germany owns the property.
The house has no glass, light and
air being admitted by long, high grilles
of thin bamboo sticks. These can be
pushed open from inside if more air and
light are required. There are no rooms,
necessary divisions being marked off by
tall screens. Outside the house is a wide
coral strand. It cradles a lapis-lazuli
lagoon which occasionally gleams opaline
and which harbors exotic fish colorful as
birds and butterflies. Into the lagoon the
party from Sydney popped for their warm
baths. The only cold water they felt
came out of the shower indoors. The
sun rose behind their hut and shone on
Moorea, directly opposite, and set again
behind that island’s fantastic hills.
The inhabitants of O’Brien’s Magic Isles
of the South Seas are now almost all
Chinese; and Mother Grundy rules to
such an extent that in their native dances
the women wear their Mother Hubbards
below their hula-hulas. But still the
bougainvillaea burns.


NORTH OF
WENTY- EIGHT
Members and Aldermen.
Alderman Power is a well-known
figure in the Brisbane City Council. One
day, perhaps, he will aim higher and
become a member of the Assembly.
G. F. R. Nicklin, M.L.A. for Mur-
rumba, is a supporter of A. E. Moore and
is 37 years old. He was born at
Murwillumbah (N.S.W.), and was at the
war for 3\ years, but the rest of his
adult life has been spent in fruitgrow-
ing. For 11 years he was secretary of
the Palmwood Fruitgrowers’ Association,
and for five years was secretary of the
local Agricultural Show. He has done a
lot of good, clean fighting for the S.Q.
fruitgrowers, and this earned him his
seat in Parliament.
P. K. Copley is the Labor member for
Kurilpa. He won the seat with the swing-
over to the Forgan Smiths in June last
year. He is only 32, and was born in
Ipswich. First of all he served in the
public service and from the ages of 24 to
27 was president of the State Service
Union. He read law and became a bar-
rister. Copley has been briefed by many
unions in Arbitration cases, and now
represents them in Parliament. He has
been secretary of many Labor political
groups.
NORTHERN FACES, No. 8.
Alderman Power.
G. F. R. Nicklin, M.L.A.
P. K. Copley, M.L.A.
J. O’Keefe, M.L.A.
E. L. Grimstone, M.L.A.
J. O’Keefe, M.L.A., a very active
union worker in his time, sits on the
Government side of the House. He
represents Cairns, where he is popular
with almost everybody except the more
vivid brand of U.A.Ps.
E. L. Grimstone, who was born in
Mackay 50 years ago, and who knows
a lot about sugar and wheat, has sat in
the Queensland Parliament since 1928 as
a U.A.P. member. He was a school-
teacher and served in various parts of
the State. While teaching in the Darling
Downs district he worked experimental
plots, dealing chiefly with wheat and
corn. He was awarded first prize in the
district on one occasion. He is one of
the Chairmen of Committees.
“Headingley”: The census shows that
we northerners have now almost a mon-
opoly of Black Brother. Of the 39,000
who did not fill in forms, and whose
numbers seemed to be computed by
sheer guesswork, the whole lot live up
this way, and of the 22.857 full bloods
who are enumerated, 8330 are in Queens-
land, 5841 in the N.T., 7133 in W.A.—
mostly in the north. N.S.W. blacks have
dwindled to 906, Victoria’s to 78. S.A.
still has 568, and there is one sad relic
of ancient smell and glory in the Speck.
* * * *
“The Old ’Un”: Women’s fashions are
a thing no sensible fellow will argue
about. One year they hoist their kirtles
up to near the Equator, and cut their
hair so short and confine their busts so
severely that one wonders why they put
such faith in legs and lipstick ; and the
next they let their hair dangle on their
collar-bones, cover their legs and paint
their fingernails. There has been a try-
ing period of transition for the last two
years, but the Brisbane spring of ’33
brings back with it a realisation that a
skirt can be a thing of beauty. In Queen-
street, in the first week of October, I saw
young Diana, clothed in virginal white,
pass through the throng, every swirl of
her drapery worthy of the chisel of a
Phidias, and, mincing down Edward-
street, a pair of lassies with hats acock at
a saucy angle swung pleats that would
have evoked a villanelle from Verlaine.
* * * *
“Hanuabada”: These “luxury-liner”
tourist trips to Papua are not regarded
with much favor by an Administration
which likes to keep its darky as much
in the background as possible. One such
lot of visitors received on arrival at Port
Moresby a communique from the Gov-
ernor’s secretary; it deplored a dis-
tressing development of mendicancy
among the simple children of the soil as
the result of the readiness of globe-
trotters to give any local darky 4s. for
the privilege of taking his photograph,
this being one of the instances cited of
misplaced generosity. The document
begged the tourists to forbear and thus
“help to keep the character of these
people unspoiled.” It was a moving tale,
but, considering that the Papuan has
been rated as the most importunate and
ungrateful cadger in the South Seas ever
since the white man first came in con-
tact with him, it seems over the odds to
blame the tourists.
* * * *
“J. Hop”: While those controlling the
Queensland police are enthusiastic about
modern innovations, such as wireless-
patrol cars, they are not unmindful of
the comfort of their men. At present
serious attention is being given to the
matter of foot-mats for the traffic bob-
bies. These have long complained bit-
terly of being compelled to stand for
hours on concrete streets in a Queens-
land summer. Rubber, cork and wood
are being experimented with to discover
the most suitable variety of mat.
* * * *
“Kuranda”: What time the Queensland
Government whoops up its lotteries, the
Northern Police Commissioner is deeply
pained at the spread of unlicensed book-
makers. His men “cannot devote their
whole time to the suppression of gam-
ing,” but he says that “judging by the
prosecutions they are seized with its
gravity.” Which is obvious —746 prose-
cutions have been launched in the last
year in Queensland.
* * * *
“Vic”: Hart, J., who has gone to
North Queensland as acting Supreme
Court Judge, is a mild-looking person,
but he is proving himself all too vigorous
for the rowdy criminal element which
has been introducing Townsville and the
surrounding cities to American crime
methods. Two gents, who came up
before him at Mackay got a tongue-
dressing which should have taken
a year off their wholesome sentences.
Two more charged at Charters Towers
with robbery with violence had five and
three and a half years’ hard doled out
to them respectively with the remark
that they were lucky not'to be flogged.
’Sonah said that Charles Lilley had
put down garroting many years ago with
the use of the cat, and gave a broad hint
that he might not be above doing the
same with the bombing and violent-rob-
bery business. He is likely to prove
more effective as a deterrent than all the
fast luxury coupes and wireless sets
which the police wish to have bought for
them.
“J.”: As a result of the banana settle-
ment scheme which Queensland Govern-
ment has inaugurated at Upper Mud-
geeraba, in the Nerang shire area, 100
families will be placed shortly. The men
are promised that they will require no
capital or assets other than their own
labor to make a living. The land will
be cleared, roads constructed and £7O
spent on each family in providing a hut,
tools and banana suckers. It is first-class
land for the purpose.
* * * *
“Moonmera”: Mount Morgan once
more is playing fairy godmother to those
who need a little good gold. Apart from
the production of the mine, George
Lavell and his party have bought a
pumping-plant to clean up the tailings
from the old stamper battery which lie
at the bottom of the company’s oldest
dam. A lot of gold was wasted in the
early days because the crude processes
of the time could not cope with the
highly complex local ore, but losses were
greater in copper than in gold. It was
not till after the big drought of 1903 that
the company worried about copper at
all. Then the out-of-works taught it
what the prospects of the business were
by laying down sluices full of burnt
jam-tins in the track of the tailings
water and banking up to £l5O per month
out of the proceeds.
Gals’ Gossip from Brisbane
At Ascot races the Cameron lady
and Mrs. Arthur Moore wore black
and white. The William Kents were
among the country visitors, she in
golden brown with hat to match. Ella
O’Shea, who helped Pat to invite a few
guests for afternoon tea on the com-
mittee verandah, just needed her eye-
veil to give effect to her Patou-
pink crepe turnout. She brought with
her Mrs. Maurice Cohen, who will soon
trip to U.S.A. Hilda Lane Mullins,
from Sydney, had large black buttons
sewn on her blue-and-white plaid suit
with materialled hat.
So that the Bush Book Club might
make more money, Mrs. Robert Scott,
professionally known as Dulcie Cran,
booked Cremorne Theatre and produced
four one-act plays. Dulcie was in the
cast for two of them, “Women Do
Things Like That” (Olive Conway) and
“The Stocking” (Christie Gilbert). In
both her personality dominated the
stage. Ushers were busy parking
flowers and sweets until the final cur-
tain. The Mayoral Greenes were pre-
sent, she carrying a bouquet of gladioli
presented by the 8.8. C. president, Mrs.
Ormond Smith.
Farewell parties are being given for
Sybil Warner, who is soon to trek back
to South Africa after twelve months here
with her aunt, Mrs. A. E. Moore. Joan
Bond decorated her home at Hamilton
one afternoon with deep-red roses, and
gathered a few girls for bridge. Delph.
blue was chosen by the hostess, and the
guest wore her favorite green.
Doris Waraker had the thrill of sitting
in the front row at All Saints’ Hall the
other night and seeing her play “Brother-
hood” put on by the W.E.A. Dramatic
Society, which does a lot to encourage
Australian writers. On the same pro-
gramme was a curtain-raiser by G. L.
Dann, “The Giant.” Both plays were
produced by G. B. Eaton. Mr. Dann,
who lives at Sandgate, is feeling very
pleased just now, as the Adelaide Reper-
tory intends to produce a one-act play of
his, “Monday Morning.” He has a
three-acter up his sleeve.
St. Mary’s, Kangaroo Point, the home
of Dr. Lilian Cooper and Miss M. J.
Bedford, stands high above the river, and
looks over the Botanic Gardens. To
this picturesque spot sedans rolled up
with 160 women, who shuffled the cards
in the cause of the Playground Associa-
tion. Mrs. P. J. Ross had a big say in
the success of the afternoon. Mrs. S. F.
McDonald and Mrs. Willie Persse helped.
Barbara Sisley subdued the lights of
her studio one night with cherry-pink
shades, put gerberas and antirrhinums ir
every vase, and gave a jolly party for hei
past pupils. Barbara has the happy knack
of running a party in a most informal
and original way, so it is only natural
that this annual reunion is looked for-
ward to by our elocutionists.
Alfred Hill’s pupil Lorraine Hender-
son put her trunks aboard the Ballarat
labelled London, Paris and Berlin. She
is to continue her musical studies. Lor-
raine won the Ernest Wunderlich scholar-
ship for three years at Sydney Conserva-
torium and the violin bow presented by
Arthur Smith.
Colonel and Mrs. W. W. Alderman
saw their younger daughter, Dulcie,
wedded to David Swan, of Victoria, at
St. Alban’s C. of E., Auchenflower.
Dulcie wore royal- and light-blue maro-
cain spattered with flowers, with accom-
panying swagger coat and blue hat.
Only Australian composers were on the
programme for E. R. B. Jordan’s 36th
Austral recital. E.R.B. himself contri-
buted several numbers. The packed
audience was disappointed when it was
announced that Alfred Hill’s two songs
would not be sung, owing to the indis-
position of Maurice Ballard. Fritz Hart
(Melbourne), Brewster Jones (Adelaide)
and our own Dailey Scarlett got a
hearing.
To give a helping hand to the Crbche
and Kindergarten, Mrs. Forgan Smith
arranged a bridge party. Mesdames
Percy Pease, E. M. Hanlon and H. A.
Bruce had a hand in running the show.
Mrs. Smith had a palish pink rose
nestling on her black gown. The Lord
Mayor brought the Mayoral lady, who
wrapped a black velvet jacket round her
white figure-fitting frock. Mrs. Elwell’s
black satin frock glittered with sequins.
All family antiques are being dusted
to appear before Sir Leslie Wilson at the
City Hall on November 20. For five
days an antique and curio exhibition will
be staged to assist the Soldiers’ C. of E.
Help Society. Lady Mayoress Greene
is not lacking in her interest and has
already commenced on the catalogue.
Jean Rigby, of the beautiful contralto
voice, has an appointment at St. Paul’s
Presbyterian on November 17 with
Maurice Shaw, of Toorak, Melbourne.
She was the principal guest at a tea party
at Rowe’s, hostessed by Mrs. Guy Ather-
ton and Mrs. G. Robbins.
The Y.W.C.A. had a crowded room
for its 13th birthday party, and a happy
crowd they were, too. Their sec., Milli-
cent Jones, who soon departs for Mel-
bourne, had been persuaded to recount
her experiences of a Continental tour in
1931. Her audience enjoyed being taken
to Milan, Paris, Lucerne and Oberam-
mergau.
Nancy, elder daughter of Dr. and
Mrs. W. J. White, of Sydney, is wearing
a ring on her left hand, given her by
Humfry, Judge Henchman’s eldest son.
It was hard luck that the Blair lady was
not well enough to attend her own
Charity Bridge Club’s annual appeal.
But she was there in spirit, and had sent
along lots of her friends. When the
committee rang her and told her all avail-
able space at Lennon’s was occupied, she
felt quite happy.
Ella O’Shea and brother Pat are widely
known for their genial hospitality. India,
N.S.W. and M.L. were represented at their
dinner-table the night they entertained
the Maurice Cohens (M.L.), Maesmore
Morris (Ceylon) and Hilda Lane-Mullins
(Sydney). Ella’s frock gleamed a ruby-
red, matching the roses on the table.

7 have a five-valve neutrodyne receiver and
dynamic speaker, the tone of which is harsh
and unnatural. New valves result in no im-
provement. (1) What is wrong ? (2) Remedy ?
—8468.
(1) Assuming that the set once gave satis-
faction, the trouble is probably due to (a)
insufficient or incorrect bias or H.T. voltages;
(, b ) moving coil of speaker out of alignment.
If the speaker was bought some time after
the set, the trouble may be due to the inability
of the last valve to handle the required power
to operate the speaker, or to incorrect match-
ing. (2) Adjust H.T. and bias voltages to suit
the valves in use, especially the audio valves,
and if this results in no improvement use in
the power stage a low-impedance valve which
is not too heavy on battery current, but which
will handle the power necessary to operate the
speaker.
(1) What is Einstein’s theory of relativity?
(2) Books on the subject ? —8523.
(1) “Popular” explanations are misleading.
Einstein’s hypotheses supplement, and in some
cases contradict, the cosmic generalisations of
Newton. A very high degree of mathematical
proficiency is necessary to appreciate Einstein’s
reasoning and its implications, and the student
must be well grounded in the latest develop-
ments of physics. (2) The simplest recent work
on the subject is Arthur Lynch’s “Case Against
Einstein,” which traverses the conclusions of
such books as Eddington’s “Mathematical
Theory of Relativity,” but Lynch’s work, being
polemical and destructive, is not a good intro-
duction. It gives, however, a fair idea of the
difficulties of the subject.
Can you give me some points on the judging
of sheep- and cattle-dogs? —Bsls.
No room here for a treatise on such a large
subject. Get a copy of Robert Kaleski’s “Aus-
tralian Barkers and Biters”; 3/6.
(1) Name of a correspondence school that
trains students for the Amateur Radio Operator’s
Proficiency Certificate ? (2) Cost and duration
of course ? —B4Bl.
(1) Marconi School of Wireless, 97 Clarence-
street, Sydney. (2) £2O, payable in monthly in-
stalments of £2. Course takes about ten
months.
If an employer in N.S.W. neglects to deduct
unemployment-relief tax from an employee, can
the employer recover the amount of tax six
months after the employee is discharged, and is
either party liable to a penalty ? —8276.
Liability to collect the tax and affix stamps
rests on the employer. Failure in this respect
renders him liable to 10 p.c. penalty on the tax
applicable, and also to prosecution. Right of
an employer to collect tax from an employee
at some late date has not been tested.
What are the dimensions of Captain Cook’s
cottage —the one that is to be brought to Aus-
tralia—and of what materials is it constructed ?
—8396.
The building is in part 25ft. and in part
30ft. wide, with a depth of 18ft. Walls are
15ft. high to the eaves. According to Besant’s
book on Cook, the cottage was of stone with
a red-tiled roof, but recent descriptions refer
to it as a brick cottage with only a small amount
of stonework, which seems to indicate some
rebuilding.
(1) Are parts of the Thistle oil-engine still
procurable in Australia ? (2) If so, name of
agents ? (3) Any other particulars of interest ?
—8444.
(1) and (2) Yes, from G. E. S. Sandeman,
17 Elamang-avenue, Kirribilli, Sydney. (3) The
only Thistle engine traceable was made in Aus-

(1) Population of Broken Hill ? (2) Business
conditions ? (3) Industries carried on in sur-
rounding districts ? (4) Date of establishment
of Broken Hill hospital ? (5) Is it entirely under
Government control ? —8282.
(1) Twenty-seven thousand. (2) Fair at
present. Unemployment in the mines has been
a serious setback. (3) Outside mining and
sheep-farming, there is nothing worth mention-
ing. (4) June, 1887. (5) It is financed by
public contributions, workers’ contributions and
a Government grant. It is controlled by a
board consisting of four representatives each of
subsidising employers and contributing em-
ployees, and two representatives of direct sub-
scribers. At present there is no Government
representative on the board.
Duty chargeable on receipts for wages and
other payments under the Q’land Stamp Duty
AC £2 t0 8 £5 3 , Id.; £5 to £5O, 2d.; £5O to £lOO,
3d.; for each additional £lOO or fraction
thereof, 3d. There is no distinction between
receipts for wages or salary and other pay-
ments, except that the wages of any seaman,
laborer or menial servant are exempt, as are
also other wages or salary where the total sum.
if received for a year, would not exceed £4OO.
In what way does a Diese). oil-engine difjer
from a semi-Diesel ? —8451.
In the Diesel engine the compression ol the
air is carried far enough to produce the heat
required for ignition, and the oil is injected with
the aid of compressed air at a still higher pres-
sure. This engine starts without preliminary
heating. In the semi-Diesel, the compression
alone is not high enough to heat the air to
ignition temperature, and the air is partly heated
by means of an uncooled portion of the metallic
surface of the combustion chamber which re-
tains heat from the previous firing stroke. Ex-
ternal heat from a lamp is required to start the
engine.
/ have a four-valve receiver employing UY 257
valves in the two R.F. stages. Volume is con-
trolled bv varying the grid bias on these valves,
and, while it is quite satisfactory on the more
distant stations, it does not adequately control
the more powerful locals. What is the remedy ?
—8459.
Connect a resistor of 50 to 100 ohms in series
with a switch between the aerial and chassis.
This switch is opened for distant reception and
is closed for local reception.
What is frankincense, and how is it obtained ?
—8449.
It is a gum-resin obtained from trees of the
genus Boswellia, of the order Busemcece. It is
gathered by means of a deep incision made in
the trunk, from which it exudes, hardening by
exposure to the air. .It has a bitter taste, and
smells like balsam when heated. It burns with
a bright flame and fragrant odor, and is used
in incense, fumigating powders and in the com-
position of stimulating plasters.
Exports from Australia to China for the last
year for which figures are available, giving
figures for separate items ? —8461.
For the year ending June 30, 1932: Butter,
£65,349; meats, £13,790; milk and cream,
£88*084; biscuits, £948; dried fruits, £2339;

£3000; silver, £42,289; all other articles,
£50,982; total, Australian produce, £4,924,014;
other produce, £18,845 ; total exports,
£4,942,859.
Excise revenue collected in Australia, 1931-
32 ?— 8473.
Beer, £4,738,848; spirits, £1,452,422; tobacco,
£1,870,564; cigars, £4962; cigarettes, £1,520,572;
petrol, £328,074; playing cards, £11,129; con-
centrated grape must, £1841; cigarette papers,
£6580; matches, £8330. Total, £9,943,322.
What is the strength of the Dutch Navy in
the Dutch East Indies ? —8479.
It consists of two light cruisers, eight de-
stroyers, 12 submarines, two gunboats, six mine-
layers, four torpedo motor-boats, one old battle-
ship, serving as gunnery-school ship, two survey-
ing vessels, •'ne submarine depot ship and some
old torpedo-boats. There is, besides, a Naval
Air Service, with 62 hydroplanes, and the
Colonial Navy, consisting of 17 small ships of
no significance. At latest estimate the entire
naval personnel numbered 5672.
How to get rid of silverfish ? —8343.
Spring-clean the rooms or cupboards, etc.,
and destroy all unwanted papers, as these in-
sects thrive on the glazed paper used in cata-
logues and magazines. To destroy them there
is nothing better than insect spray applied to
cracks and crevices with a pump; failing this,
use kerosene or turpentine freely, and allow it
to trickle down behind boards and linings.
How is the "Australian crawl” stroke in swim-
ming performed, and how is the breathing
done ? —7417.
The stroke is obsolete. In the days when it
was first developed, the swimmer swam flat on
the chest with head submerged, and remained
in that position until forced to lift the head to
take breath. The head was held at right angles
to the shoulders and the breath was taken by
lifting the head, not turning it to left or right.
Later the stroke was improved by Cecil Healy,
who introduced a better method of breathing.
Healy took breath at every stroke of the right
arm. As the right arm was travelling forward
out of water he turned the head towards the
arm and inhaled, and exhaled under water as
the head again turned to the front.
(1) Information about the red snake (Hoplo-
cephalus superbus)—whether back-fanged or
front-fanged, viperine or colubrine, length, and
whether arboreal or terrestrial ? (2) Are figures
available regarding reported cases of snake-
bite, and number ending fatally, in Australia, or
in any State ? Approximately what percentage
of cases ends in death ? (3) A list of books
dealing with Australian snakes ? —8309.
(1) Commonly known as the “copper-head,”
it is a front-fanged snake, belonging to the
colubrine group. It is terrestrial and attains a
length of nearly five feet. (2) Figures regard-
ing reported snake-bite are not published. The
approximate percentage of deaths in recent years
is not available, but from investigations by Dr.
Tidswell, prior to 1906, and by Dr. Ferguson,
from 1896 to 1924, it seems that in 250 cases
investigated the percentages of deaths were:
From death-adder bite, 50; from tiger-snake,
40; from brown snake. 8; from black snake,
nil. (3) “Australian Snakes,” by G. Krefft,
published 60 years ago; “Australian Snakes,”
by E. R. Waite, published 30 years ago; and
“Animals of Australia,” by Lucas and Le Souef,
are out of print, but second-hand copies may
be available. “Reptiles of South Australia,”
by E. R. Waite, published only a few years ago,
deals only with S.A. species. “The Snakes ol
Australia,” by J. R. Kinghorn, published two
years ago, price 10s., is out of print, but the
author, c/o Australian Museum, Sydney, has
two spare copies.
Is "La Savate” (fighting with the feet) still
popular in France? —8541. .
The technique of the precisely-directed kick
is not extinct, and there are still friendly foot-
fights in private, but public bouts have not been
seen for 40 years. The fame won by Georges
Carpentier and Eugene Criqui is evidence that
the French have studied the British method of
fist-fighting to good advantage.
(1) In the event of a magneto condenser
breaking down, would it be possible to make
a temporary condenser out of ordinary insulated
lighting wire ? (2) If so, particulars of con-
struction ? (3) Materials employed in the con-
struction of magneto condensers? (4) Where
procurable ? —8436.
(1) and (2) Would not be practicable
owing to insufficient capacity. (3) Usually con-
sists of about 160 layers of mica insulation
material between which sheets of tinfoil are
laid so that each layer is electrically insulated
from its immediate neighbor, but alternate
sheets arc connected together. (4) Tinfoil is
obtainable from Jones, Steains and Waller, 261
Clarence-street, or from Parsons Bros, and Co.,
321 Kent-street, both Sydney.
Where can I obtain a copy of “Australian
Nursery Rhymes,” collected from “The Red
Page” of The Bulletin, and published about
16 years ago ? —8476.
The book has been long out of print. The
Service Dept, will post a printed sheet contain-
ing all the rhymes in the book to any reader
who accompanies a request for it with a
stamped and addressed envelope.
If an old-age pensioner desires payment of
his pension to be made to some other person
for the benefit of the pensioner, what action
should he take ? —8465.
He may apply to the Registrar of Pensions
for the district for the issue of a warrant
authorising payment to such other person.
Forms of application may be obtained at any
post office, or from the Registrar or Deputy
Commisioner.
How were Scottish tartans originally dyed and
woven ? —8332.
The dyes, mostly vegetable, were home-made.
Two hundred years ago every Highland farmer’s
wife (according to contemporary authorities)
was competent to dye blue, red, green, yellow,
black, brown and their compounds. A beauti-
ful purple was derived from the hyacinth, black
came from alder-bark, red from a root called
“ine,” or from a compound of bullock’s blood
and lime. Weaving was done on hand looms.
The exact pattern of the tartan was given on a
slender rod, on which were indicated the colors,
the number of threads for each and their posi-
tion in the pattern.
Cl) What is the weight of a sovereign ? (2)
Proportions of gold and alloy ? (3) How many
carats in sovereign gold ? —8431.
(1) 123.27447 grains. (2) Gold, 113.00160
grains; alloy, 10.27287 grains. (3) Twenty-two.
What was the instrument used in military
operations in tUe Great War to detect the tunnel-
ing operations of the enemy, and on what prin-
ciple did it work ? —8440.
Two types of equipment were in use, the
geophone, similar in construction to the stetho-
scope, and the seismophone, an electrical micro-
phone.
(1) What is the highest building in the world ?
(2) Why are there no skyscrapers in London ?
(3) What is the reason for the English prejudice
against high buildings ? (4) What is Sydney’s
height limit ? —8529.
(1) The Empire State Building in New York,
1248 ft. (2) London’s limit for commercial and
residential buildings is 80ft., extensible to 100 ft.
in special circumstances. (3) No particular
prejudice. Manchester and Glasgow are con-
sidering the taking of steps to legalise the erec-
tion of very tall buildings, but English muni-
cipalities seem to be concerned to a greater
degree than American authorities with sunlight
and with the, problems associated with fire ex-
tinction. Queen Victoria is credited with in-
fluencing the present statutory law that controls
building heights. She disapproved of the
dominance of London’s skyline by 'Queen Anne
mansions, visible from the windows of Bucking-
ham Palace, and the section of the Building Act
that limits heights is said to have been inspired
by her. (4) 150 feet.
(1) What wood is used in the making of
aboriginal spears, wommeras and axes ? (2)
How do the blacks chip their axe blades ?
(3) Where is the resin on wommeras obtained ?
—8335.
' (1) Spears consist of a single piece of hard-
wood, mulga, acacia or casuarina, or a hollow
shaft —reed, giant marshmallow or tecoma —or a
light-wood shaft—lignum or triodea —with a
hardwood or stone head. The wommera is also
made of many different species of wood, some
light, some hard. (2) The axe blade may be made
from a river pebble, when it is flaked at one end
by blows with a hammer-stone, and then
ground to the required edge; or it may be
flaked to shape from a block of stone. Many
of these axe-grinding grooves are to be seen
along creeks and near waterholes. Basalt,
quartzite, chert and other siliceous stones are
used in making round-edge axes. (3) The
cement used to attach a stone or shell scraper
to the wommera is obtained from porcupine-
grass, grass-tree, ironwood and various pines
and wattles. Beeswax is also used.
What authors would I do well to study
for the improvement of style in writing ? —8256.
Macaulay (lucidity, narrative movement), Gray’s
letters (careful precision of expression), Horace
Walpole’s letters (grace, felicity), Edmund Burke
(balance in eloquence), Charles Lamb’s essays
and letters (sincerity, personal appeal). John-
son is rather hard reading, but he is vigorous
and direct; Hazlitt’s style is excellent.
What does the Arabic word “hadj” mean ?
8519.
It means generally ‘ a setting out,” and is
used particularly in reference to the greater pil-
grimage of Mohammedans to Mecca. The term
is used more loosely to include the “umrah” or
lesser pilgrimage to Mecca, a pilgrimage to any
shrine or sacred place, and also the pilgrim-
ages of Eastern Christians to Jerusalem. The
title of “hadji” is given to all Mohammedans
who have performed the treater pilgrimage.

Alma Figuerola, who has exhibited for
some years with the Vic. Artists’ Society,
shows decided development in her first
solo show at the Meldrum Galleries,
Melbourne. An obvious exponent of the
realistic school, she gives no more than
an impression of what is before her, and
in her still-life she succeeds admirably.
“Iris,” one of the best of them, appears
to be sucking up the water out of the
vase it is standing in. In “Jumble,” a
collection of teapots and things, she has
got no further than the general state-
ment of a theme, but she has caught the
sparkle of light on a heterogeneous col-
lection of articles. In the landscape
division, “Rough Sea” seems to have
most of the same experimental quality.
A particularly good portrait is an old
gentleman with a pipe called “Contem-
plation.”

The ease with which lovely woman
can turn the interior of a forbidding flat
or a house that has stood mouldy and
vacant for a decade into a thing of beauty
and refinement arouses admiration. With
unfailing tact and discrimination and a
few yards of cheap material, she can
work wonders in color, line and har-
mony. Moreover, she can decorate her
own person in the same transcendent
manner, and even the way she pipeclays,
rouges and transforms her visage some-
times has points about it. But when she
turns to pigment and canvas her cunning,
if not her courage, departs from her
seemingly, judging by the 24th annual
exhibition of the Melbourne Society of
Women Painters at the Athenaeum. With
few exceptions, the work displayed was
crude and without discernment, and
some of it was as rough as bags, and even
rougher. The “Spring” of E. M. Dunn
was one of the exceptions, the “Hill” of
D. G. Moore another. Some of the
exquisite texture of a “Winter Evening”
has been caught by Aileen Dent in .No.
37, and Miss A. M. E. Bale is, as usual,
sensitive to delicate qualities, as evi-
denced by “A Peony and a Half.”

“F.S.”: There is a row in Melbourne
because the Nat. Gallery has refused to
join in with the other capitals in sub-
scribing for a loan exhibition of modern
British art, valued at £50,000. Critics
and connoisseurs are astonished at the
decision, as the cash involved is a paltry
£l5O, and the Nat. Gallery doesn’t have
to spend money on the pictures it wants
to own, since the Felton Bequest does
that for it. Personally, I am astonished
myself, but for a different reason. The
Nat. Gallery has a positive reverence for
British art, and one would have thought
it would have jumped at the offer. If
it can proudly hang Glen Philpotts’s pic-
ture of a cement man coming out of a
cement hole and being pushed back by
a cement man, it ought to welcome a
whole exhibition of modern British art
with a dozen hands, as the Malays say.

It is announced that Melbourne’s
£27,000 Rembrandt has been examined
by an expert who used infra-red photo-
graphy, and declares there is no longer
any doubt about its authenticity. The
fact is a curious commentary on the
qualifications of “experts.” As the pic-
ture is a self-portrait, is supposed to have
been one of the finest works of the
master and to date from his later period,
there should never have been any doubt
about it, because if Rembrandt didn’t
paint it, who did? There was no painter
living in his day with optical science
equal to Rembrandt. Similarly, in pri-
vate hands in Melbourne is a picture
which is certainly by Reynolds. There
is no doubt about it, because nobody else
in the England of the period could have
painted it. It has no commercial value
because it has no name or history, though
in artistic value it is equal to other pic-
tures by Reynolds for which galleries
cheerfully pay thousands.

Harold Herbert, whom one remembers
best as a prolific composer of spring
songs and autumnal hymns in water-
color, this year chants the charms of grey
gums standing up to their ankles in chaste
snow. His show, which refrigerates the
interior of the Fine Arts, Melbourne,
consists of 21 winterscapes, painted round
Buffalo, plus some Tasmanian views.
Most of the snow pictures are almost
monochromes, though the jerseys of
ski-ers give a touch of color to one study
and make it the most attractive of the lot.

Waded into the brawl.
“Murder” and “police” an—
Old woman did bawl.
A table went up and—
Crockery went down
The proprietor did rave—
With a diabolical frown.
From my chair I arose.
With dignity quiet.
Disliking to be
Mixed up in a riot.

to your thoughts might be more successful in
prose... .J.H.R.: It’s still beyond u5....M.5.:

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Hundreds of white-winged yachts
pranced upon the blue of Port Jackson
on Saturday afternoon, circled Fort Deni-
son, and streamed back to Neutral Bay,
wind-blown and laughing. As the old
cannon on the lawns barked out its com-
mand, the Royal Sydney Yacht squad-
ron on Kirribilli Point opened its 72nd
sailing season. At the foot of the club-
house lawns a line of shining craft
dressed themselves at a given moment
in the bunting of rejoicing, and the green
sward bloomed with frocks as gay as
anything in the garden plots. There were
tea, dancing and cocktails on the veran-
dahs and in the reception-rooms, all
heady with the scent of broom, and on
the lawn just inside the Peel-street gates
the Westmead Boys’ Band played with
unabated spirit during the afternoon.
Even with a meat-axe you couldn’t have
kept Sydney’s bright young things out
of the “Snappy Sydney” revue. Every-
body under 50 that one has ever heard
of in the social whirl bounced on and
off the Savoy stage, and after three nights
their sprightliness was still unwilted. The
girls in it were really lovely—face, figure,
frocking were all 100 per cent., and, if
voice was rather minus, you noticed that
at least their feet were not flat. There
was one girl who came out dressed like
a chilli in red, shiny cowboy pants
and a green top. She must have felt
like one when her sirocco-like dance was
ended. Another handsome girl sang a
song about her man being away and it
raining all the time. She sang this in
very, very deep, vibrant tones, and you
felt glad it hadn’t thundered while her
man was away, because how could she
have possibly dug up deeper notes?
A group in rhythmic frocks, led by the
dagger-slim Mrs. Venour Nathan, danced
to the refrain “Love Is the Sweetest
Thing.” The song seemed to need half a
pint of honey. There was a Street Scene
that clicked as smartly as a zip-fastener ;
there was a skit on film advertising that
shook the house from genteel into real
laughter. Jean Cheriton, principal of
Doone, fair and graceful in sea-green
laces, sat up among the vice-regals and
enjoyed “Done” —a day in the life of
an academy for finishing young ladies.
The Governor’s David and aide Charles
Gifford had the star parts, and Lady
Game sat in the audience and led the
applause of a house that wore tails and
diamonds. The Gordon lady, Enid
Baumberg and Beryl Bryant were the
instigators. Crown-street Women’s Hos-
pital benefits.
Cecil Sherwood, the Australian tenor
who came back to his native Sydney
the other week at the invitation of the
A.8.C., is a very excited man. When
he arrived in Sydney he brought with
him an Italian wife ; when he goes back
to Milan he will take a Bondi baby.
The youngster, Cecil’s first son, was born
at grandmother Sherwood’s house within
coo-ee of the Pacific breakers. Other
married sons and daughters of the house
have presented girl children, but this is
the first embryo tenor.
Adam Lindsay Gordon and J. E.
Davenport shared the honors of the Insti-
tute of Journalists’ party at Vaucluse
House. The former was crowned with
laurels because it was his centenary;
the latter was presented with a pink iced
cake begirt by twelve candles because for
twelve years he has been the institute’s
secretary, and has done the job for love.
Poet Green, of the Fisher library, pre-
sident Elliott Napier, R. Lockley and
Montgomerie Stewart each lifted a torch
to the memory of the lovable Adam,
while a slim new moon peeped down
through the leafy trees. A stroll through
the rooms bedight with furniture of
Wentworthian period was polished off
with coffee and chat. Throbbing motor-
’buses picked up guests at the gates where
once four-in-hands had champed at the
bit.
The Consuls-General in our midst and
their wives were entertained in the
grand manner last week by the Royal
Empire Society. Neither the red carpet
nor the red roses were spared ; bunches
of the latter were bestowed on each
consular lady, with a grace that was as
the cooing of doves, by Hugh Denison’s
consort, and Hugh himself, the president
of the Empirians, lit up the proceedings
with a smile that would be invaluable to
the League of Nations. The Denison
lady’s pale beige laces were ground-long,
with a short overflow of train and a cape
fastened about the throat. Marchesa
Ferrante glittered in coal-black satins
and a dazzle of sequins; America’s
Mrs. Caldwell’s laces were the blue
of sky-after-rain; pale gold satin
shone on Sweden’s Mrs. De Dardel;
the Consul-General for France and
Madame Dussap were among the glit-
ter, she in lamd that held the green
and gold of some exotic beetle’s wing ;
Sophie Segaert maintained the dignity of
Belgium in parchment satin, and all the
other countries of Europe were etched
with a touch of grandeur into the map
of the evening.
President Esther Kahn at the piano,
playing Magyar tone poems by Erno,
and Bulletin “Hop’s” daughter Dorothy,
plying her talented bow, tickled the musi-
cal palate of the guests at the Josef
Kretschmann Club. Recent guests were
Mr. and Mrs. Heinecke, from Germany ;
Mrs. Heinecke was before her marriage
May Mitchell, a pupil of the beloved
Josef. The Sydney girl went off to
Vienna years ago to further her studies,
discovered the holy estate of matrimony,
and has never had time until the present
year of grace to come back to Australia.
Jean Rankin, who smiles from this
Bernice Agar picture, is one of the rea-
sons for the success of the at-home held
by the nurses of St. Vincent’s last week.
Jean was one of the dance secretaries
and busied herself generally about the
arrangements of this the sixteenth birth-
day of the function. Up till the last two
or three years the nurses used to receive
their guests in the quadrangle of the
big Darlinghurst hospital, and, aided by
the medicals, they flavored proceedings
with song and dance numbers. Now
the intimate party has grown into a ball,
and this year’s drew hundreds of St.
Vincent’s admirers to the Wentworth.
A table-decorating competition re-
sulted in a first prize for Marcia Cor-
deaux, who decked her board with the
coolness of pale pink carnations and blue
cornflowers, and marked each guest’s
place with a gaily colored candle. Mary
Anderson’s arrangement of mauve and
red sweet-peas punctuated by name-cards
masquerading as nurses came a close
second. Both prize-winners were nurses,
which seems to prove that the minister-
ing angel has the aesthetic sense well
developed.
When Parramatta gets launched on its
145th birthday festivities, Mrs. Harry
Ohlsen will take the helm. She is quite
used to steering a. happy course through
the old town’s seas of pleasure and excite-
ment, having been its civic hostess for
the past four years. She and her genial
Mayor have lived in Parramatta for over
30 years, and are regarded with as much
affection as the tower of historic St.
John’s. Mrs. Ohlsen is president of the
ladies’ committee. The junketings being
arranged include a vice-regal ball, at
which the Governor and Lady Game will
receive a number of debs, whose bloom-
ing has been kept back for this end-of-
the-season event; a river pageant of the
arrival of Governor Phillip ; a masked
ball, gymkhanas and a street carnival
complete with battle of roses.
Mrs. Charles Lamplough and Mrs. H.
Brocklebank gathered a fine array of
their friends and kinswomen around
them the other day. The hostesses
may be described as Nordic beau-
ties, of an extreme blondeness, Mrs.
Lamplough a trifle more Wagnerian as
to outline than Mrs. Brocklebank. Both
of them seemed to turn a searching eye
on Marcella, a young relation whose
resemblance to them would have been
stronger but for the flush that tinged her
snow-whiteness —perhaps she had been
kissed in a hurry. Amy Johnson was
made welcome. Lady Hillingdon, a lan-
guishing golden beauty, looked coldly
on Mrs. Dunlop Best, who was lovely in
the same manner ; but Star of Holland,
dusky with romance and in velvety reds,
drew all eyes. Dainty Bess, Isobel and
several Irish beauties lifted candid smil-
ing faces to the world. The party, which
had been arranged by the Horticultural
Society, turned the Town Hall into a
censer to spring, though the Governor-
General’s lady, who opened the show,
might have arrived in more jocund array
than her black white-topped raiment.
Mrs. Hugh Poate, wife of the society’s
president, brought spring in her wide hat
and light-weight frocking, and many of
the women who flitted from flower to
flower aired the chiffon, the printed silk,
the patterned cambric and pique of the
hour.
Romance has come to Kirribilli House,
the white cottage with the pointed
gables on Kirribilli Point which an older
generation remembers as the home of
Tom Laurie, and which more recently
provided lodging for the Governor-
General’s staff when Admiralty House
was still a G.-G.’s perk. The girl with
the ring is Elsie Lundgren, an attractive
daughter of the Captaih Lundgren
couple. The diamond-provider is Alexis
Albert, whose father is Frank Albert, a
local shah of sheet-music, pianos, saxo-
phones and suchlike melodious instru-
ments. There are also a yacht or two in
the family, and a sumptuous home in
Elizabeth Bay built on the Spanish plan,
with three distinct telephone numbers,
the young man having one all to him-
self. Alexis may not be Royalty, still
there are numerous royalties he’s heir to.
Hundreds of business girls flicked an
extra dusting of powder on nose and
ch'in and went around to Farmer’s to
have lunch with Jack Crawford and his
sylphlike wife. Between nibbles of salad
budding womanhood gazed with admira-
tion on the racqueteer and perhaps with
a trifle of envy on Mrs. Jack, for it is
not given to every woman to acquire for
keeps a world champion who combines
the looks of a film hero with the gentle
manner of Mary’s little lamb. When in
his speech the guest described his recent
tour as hard work, the equivalent of at
least two years’ office work, a type-
slapping little brunette muttered “Well,
I’m ready for a change of occupation
any day.” Mannequins without bumps
seasoned the courses with a parade of
tennis frocking that promises a crop of
marriage fees to clergymen.
In these October days exiled Sydney-
ites the world over are gripped with a
nostalgia for Vaucluse House and the
mauve cascades of wistaria that spill and
spray in such tender luxuriance about
the old flagged verandahs. This year
the trustees have reproduced as their
official Christmas card J. S. Watkins’s
painting “Wistaria —Vaucluse House.”
The card is to be had at all booksellers,
and it seems almost robbery to take it for
a shilling. The profits from the sale go
to the upkeep of Wentworth’s old home.
The G.-G. and his lady are paying their
respects to this historic spot to-morrow
morning.
Minnie Love put a professional curl
into the last night of the “Snappy Syd-
ney” revue and did a rollicking imper-
sonation of Chevalier. Tickets, by the
way, were clamored for until the Law
majestically said “enough,” and two
hundred or so eager citizens were turned
away empty. After the final curtain, the
whole cast went cheerfully mad in
Romano’s. The proprietor thereof, be-
coming positive that prosperity was just
around the corner, raised his voice and
sang “O Sole Mio” for the company.
The grotto with its tinkle of water in
James Murdoch’s grounds ; the ropes of
ivy that festoon the green tunnel of drive,
the sunken garden, and the tree-
shadowed lawns of Sydney Snow’s; the
sunny openness of the Crichton-Smiths’
garden, with its deep-red roses big
enough for a poet’s cabbage ; the green
arches, the rose pergolas and the splendid
tennis-courts of G. K. Snow’s made the
meek who trundled out by ’bus to see
them during the week-end glad to re-
member that they inherited the earth.
For a shilling the four gardens were
theirs —for the afternoon at any rate. A
pink chestnut tree, a honey-locust tree
and a tulip tree were among the unusual
horticulture that drew the gaze. Judging
by the roll-up, every threepenny in Syd-
ney must have been cornered by the
Kindergarten Union.
Producer George Parker, of the J. C.
Williamson firm, was in Saturday night’s
audience of “The Snake Woman,” T. S.
Gurr’s Indian drama. The Repertory
Theatre, in Kent-street, was crowded for
the performance, and Scott Alexander’s
little company received an ovation ac-
companied by flowers at the final curtain.
Nance Gurr, the author’s daughter, in
the scarlet, gold-sequined draperies of
the Hindu girl, was a graceful and
tragic heroine.
Two bonnets and a shirt worn by
Charles 11. when a babe are the latest
treasures to be dropped in for the
Stitches in Time exhibition.

FRIENDLY SERVICE
ALL THE TIME
Some of the time, if not all the time, you must save money, but
if you are Mr. Average Citizen you know that all the time is nearer
the mark.
Whatever your margin on any one week’s salary, it won’t provide
for a sudden necessity to pay, say, £5O or £lOO. No one week’s
salary will provide education for your children, heavy medical
expenses, or comfort in your declining years.
Therefore, to make provision for the big calls, you have to save,
more or less, all the time.
The Commonwealth Savings Bank provides a friendly, efficient
savings service—all the time.

Melbourne
Chatter
Punters at the Caulfield Cup meeting
learned something about the survival of
the fittest. Those with longest wind and
fastest heels got places in queues which
fastened to the tote ticket-selling windows
the moment the previous race was run.
In the whirlpool under the grandstand
one woman lost her hat, which has not
been seen or heard of since. Another
had most of her draperies ripped off, but
was so thankful to get out alive that she
didn’t complain. The course looked
lovely. In the short week which elapsed
since the Guineas, splashes of red, pink
and purple had been coaxed to bloom
round the lakes. It was a perfect spring
day, but Melbourne women have no
faith in their climate, and most of them
wore coats ; there were not more than a
dozen organdie frocks on parade.
President’s wife, Mrs. Ben Chaffey,
issued invitations to a large luncheon
party, the guest of honor being the wife
of the Lieut.-Governor. The Irvine lady’s
frock was garnished with a black ruffle,
and Mrs. Chaffey conceded a wreath of
field flowers to the summery day. Mrs.
Colin Fraser was smart as always in
black and a wee veil. Phyllis Timmins,
all in emerald-green was under the
tailored wing of her mother. Lassies in
the members’ stand didn’t give Barbara
Lyon much chance to wear a glove—
Arthur Goodwill is her fiancd. Marie
Mackinnon was also much felicitated. She
is to become Mrs. Buesst. Of a season-
able texture was Mrs. Ivan Gutmann’s
frock of white and indigo stripes. Mrs.
T. M. Burke pinned a spray of lily of
the valley to the lapel of her black
tailored coat.
The Australian Artillery, Third Military
District, let go with a bomb which burst
as the merriest dance of the year in St.
Kilda Town Hall. Mrs. St. Clair, in
black satin with pink windows upon the
shoulders, bobbed a knee to G.-G. Isaacs,
attended by her Colonel and a bunch
of medalled and braided artillerymen.
Mrs. Bruche, in black satin, upon which
blew field flowers, and Air-Commodore
Goble’s better half, also in black, were
among wives who frequented the area
reserved for the high and mighty. Mayor
and Mayoress Gray, of St. Kilda, she
with a black rose nodding upon the cor-
sage of her claret georgettes, were
honored guests. Majors Milford and
Scrivenor brought wives clad respectively
in moon-blue and parchment. Mrs.
Clarebrough, in ice-blue and pink roses ;
Mrs. Ernest Jones, in white taffetas, and
Mrs. John Barrett, in mittens and rain-
bow flip-flaps upon her shoulders, were
others who gyrated under the whirl of
red and blue streamers.
Miss Coxon wore prawn-pink lace and
a velvet cape. Wing-Commander Harri-
son brought his wife in velvet gloves to
match her moss-green frock and slim
wisp of a Greta all-white organza, black
and white bracelets and black gloves.
Florence Counsell plucked black feathers
to trim her white cape. Mrs. Troedel
held a short train out of the range of
spurred boots. Mrs. Moss wore gold
lame and Mrs. Norman Belfe eau-de-nil.
Mrs. McConkey’s red draperies were
tethered to a brilliant buckle. Kitty Moore
danced in plentifully rucked sage-green.
The gunners displayed with pride their
pile of shields, and with affection their
14 enormous cups, brimming tankards
on the day they were won. These glit-
tering trophies come out of burglar-proof
retirement only on such occasions. There
were two sittings for supper and drinks
flowed merrily at the free buffet—when
the gunners entertain they do the thing
in style.
The G. D. Healys and daughter Nell
lit pink candles in silver candelabra and
spread a buffet supper on their closed-
in verandah. Sound waves laden with
blues and foxtrots travelled from the
flower-decked ballroom through the
lovely garden to Kooyong-road, filled
with cars great and small. It being the
racy season there were guests from the
country and from over the border. Mrs.
Healy’s black lace gown ran to a short
train. Nell was a wood-nymph wraith in
tulle and a spray of orchids. Dr. and
Mrs. Percy Brett, with Elsie in joyful
stripes of pink and crimson, the Gerald
Pattersons, the Campbell Guests and
Mrs. John Pain, ruffled in black tulle to
her ears, were there, and Mary Guy
Smith, Jacqueline Mackinnon, Betty
Stephens and Prudence Staughton sported
their prettiest frocks.
Six hundred women gathered up cards,
scorers and a handful of silver and
trotted off to match their wits at bridge
in the Green Mill. The party, an after-
noon affair, was intended to lighten the
overdraft of the C. of E. homes for chil-
dren and babies at Brighton and Darling.
Mrs. C. Barclay, Mrs. John Mills, Mrs.
Cecil Tucker, Gwen Longmore and
Peggy Nankivell were concerned with the
sale of raffle tickets, lollipops and flowers.
Among the players were the Gepp lady,
Mrs. Thorold Fink and Mrs. Arthur
Robb.
An invitation from the Emily McPher-
son Institute tickled the wife-and-mother
instincts of a multitude of Melbourne
women, who went along to see domestic
tasks made scientific and stayed to par-
take of a meal served by the cooking
adepts. Dressmaking students appeared
as mannequins in clothes fashioned by
their own fingers—well-fitting tailored
suits, swanky swagger coats and evening
garments, slinky and fluffy. Miss Chis-
holm and her staff saw that all ran
smoothly. Some enthusiastic matrons
formed there and then a parents’ asso-
ciation.
Around the exhibition of ship models
hung a tang of deep salt water, golden
bullion and rollicking pirates. Pictures
beside their treasures were the boy ship-
builders, bashful grins masking their
honest pride. Space was reserved for tea-
clippers, little frigates sailing upon real
water, and last year’s miniatures of
Nelson’s Victory. The bun of patience
goes to the maker of ships in bottles.
Behold Mona Nugent, twice blessed by
the muses. After graduating Mus. Bac.
as a pianoforte executant she discovered
a voice and gathered a Mus. Dip. for
singing. Just returned from Europe,
where she put in 2\ years polishing her
soprano notes, she has slid into an en-
gagement with the A.B.C. Pianist
Madame Masson will be her travelling
companion, and Sydney is the stepping-
off place of the couple, who will be heard
over the air from all the capitals. Miss
Nugent has an engaging personality,
sparkling brown eyes and a sleek shingle.
Her people hail from Nathalia. Lafayette
made the portrait.
There should be no need to dash home
from your bridge party, burn the family
chop and spatter your newest frock
with grease because you have no time to
change it. So said Mrs. Wardrop, Eva
Grey and Miss Stait at their lecture
(with demonstrations) on uncooked foods
in Scots Hall. They have declared war
on gas-rings. Their food consists of
fruit, grated vegetables and dishes made
from ground-nut flour. They attribute
most world troubles to crystallised sugar
—honey is their sweetening medium.
Their cakes contain neither milk nor
eggs, their jams are evolved from raw
fruit and the iciest winter day can’t tempt
them to hot nutriment. Well —you can
take it or leave it, but the woman who
would try it suddenly on a carnivorous
husband would deserve a bushel of Vic-
toria Crosses.
Pictured here by Broothorn is Mrs. Len
Buxton, who, with her husband, has
lately returned from one of her many
jaunts to the U.S.A. The lady knows
all about the thrills of the turf. One of
her steeds won the Caulfield Cup in
1929, and High Brae and Heros carry
her colors through this spring meeting.
Mrs. Buxton has proved a susceptible
subject for the golf germ and goes riding
with her little daughters at the family’s
Mt. Martha summer home. She is the
only daughter of Mr. and Mrs. C. J.
Neunhoffer.
Muriel Graham-Officer invited guests
to Menzies for a before-dinner cocktail,
receiving them in a caped frock of beige
flamisol. Her mother, Mrs. Campbell
Chomley, lent a hand in a black-and-
white diagonal material and a largish
white hat. Many of the 120 guests were
at Nell Healy’s dance later in the evening.
The committee which helps the Chil-
dren’s Hospital Queen Competition can-
didate, Betty Smith, threw out its drag-
net for a bridge party in St. Kilda Town
Hall. There was a prize for a lucky chair,
and players didn’t have to clear tables
when refreshments arrived. They saun-
tered up to a buffet and helped them-
selves. Mrs. T. W. White was among
the busy organisers.
Perth’s outdoor and indoor festivities:
The sun spread kindly rays on spring and
summer dresses at the Royal Show. Billowy
organdies floated airily in the stand, but
ensembles were more popular. Mrs. Pixie
Brockman’s nut-brown crinkle crepe was topped
by a becoming inverted frying-pan hat; scarlet
braid and buttons fastened Mrs. Bill Elford’s
shelf-shouldered black marocain; Phyl Hawter
flung a chocolate lacquer satin bow on her
brown plaid crepe; Betty Drake-Brockman’s
Atlantic-blue checks were worn with navy
accessories; Mrs. Paddy Lackman’s military-
blue silks were flecked with cloud grey, and
Portia Parker’s fresh maize linen supported
battlement effects in white.
Government House ballroom saw huntsmen’s
gay pink coats lined up for Sir Roger de
Coverley at the Hunt Club Ball. Polkas, merry
chains and other old-time dances brightened
proceedings merry from the start. Betty Black-
man connected bodice and skirt of her jade-
green ninons with garlands of water-lilies;
Doreen O’Hara chained the yoke of her snowy
confection with strands of pearls; Flyer Major
Brearley’s better half inserted leaf-shaped venti-
lations into her black nets; the French-window
effect at the back of Josephine Temperley’s
bran lace was curtained with pastel flowerlets;
Gretchen Hardy’s lime butterfly crepe was
slashed and girdled with cyclamen; brick-red
laces covered Mrs. Victor Harwood, who shared
secretarial duties with Mable Teather, a nymph
in ice blue with a streamer of dawn pink. Val-
mai Wood’s leaf-green chiffons were held in
place by a twisted swathe, and Mary Forrest’s
black Chantillys disappeared into beige at a high
waistline and emerged at the shoulder.
Dr. Ddy Smith came from Kalgoorlie and
hied him to St. Mary’s Cathedral to exchange
vows with Doreen O’Hara. Archbishop-elect
rrendiville and Dr. McMahon held either end
o the knot which tied up the dainty vision in
blush-pmk crepe inlet with cream embroideries,
exactly matching her fine straw hat and sheaf
of pink and cream roses. Mrs. Frank Malloch,
matron of honor, carried pink roses against
hydrangea-blue drapings. Cheering reverberated
at the bride’s home, where Mrs. O’Hara wel-
comed guests in magpie-plumaged georgette.
Across the sacred-toymen threshold of the
Weld Club stepped a bevy of femininity and
found itself in a maze of fairy lights twinkling
throughout the building and in the marquee,
where delectable dishes tempted the palate.
President Norbert Keenan shook gloved hands
till all the guests were assembled; then joined
the dancers in the dining-room. The Mitchell
lady’s black tulle was combined with lace;
enormous sleeves and a cluster of gardenias
horned Mrs. J. P. Dwyer’s black lacquer satin.
The heavens twinkled an eye with a flash of
lightning then laughed a hearty peal of thunder
at the joke they were playing on the 11th- 16th
Battalion by pouring rain and hail on it when
it received its new colors. The men were
drenched and his Ex.’s glossy hat and Colonel
Margolin’s chapeau streamed with water as they
presented respectively the King’s color and the
Regimental color. In spite of the inclemency
there was a splendid rally, and no spirits were
damped at the parties held subsequently in the
messes. Brigadier-General Martyn’s lady pro-
tected herself with a fox-collared brown velour
coat; Captain Boyes’s spouse shielded oyster
crepe, with a check swagger coat; Dorothy
Kirby’s tan tartan peeped from under mustard
overwear.
Joye, Mrs. Jock Morrison’s youngest fledgling,
has promised to fly from the maternal nest and
soar into matrimony with Ken Proudfoot Ander-
son, of Cottesloe.
A few lines from Adelaide:
Mrs. A. McDiarmid gave a garden party at
her Knightsbridge home in aid of the East
Torrens branch of the Mothers and Babies’
Health Association, when nearly 40.0 brought
and bought gifts, and Vera van Rij’s pupils
danced on the lawn.
Mrs. Hugh Corpe, Menindie, was hostess of
a garden party to raise funds for the Queen
of the Bush, in connection with the coming
Kuitpo Gala. The Corpe garden is remark-
able for its fine rockeries and fishponds. A
bright idea was roofing in the tennis court with
canvas—the day was very hot. Mrs. Brown, of
The Wilderness, who is 99, was among those
who enjoyed the party.
Mimi, only daughter of her widowed mother,
Mrs. Leonard Hack, of Prospect, made a
statuesque figure in parchment satin and Honi-
ton lace veil when she was wedded to Ned,
elder son of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Scales, of
Menindie, at St. Peter’s Cathedral. The brides-
maids, Moira Finlay, of Sydney, Marjorie Hay-
ward and Nancy Steele Scott, wore blue-and-
white flowered georgette and large white hats.
The Bishop of Adelaide officiated. There were
rejoicings afterwards at St. Helen’s, the resi-
dence of Mr. and Mrs. Roy Bullock.
Mrs. Alec Melrose gave a party at her resi-
dence, Robe Terrace, to welcome back Lily
Melrose, who returned from England by the
Moldavia.
Some social siftings from the Speck:
Hobart has so many tourist visitors and so
few evening entertainments —the talkies are
about all we have to offer, as a rule —that a
committee has been set up to see what can
be done about it.
Mrs. Hungerford gave an afternoon party at
Hathaway House, with the new Lieut.-Governor’s
wife as guest of honor. The hostess was in a
slim and trim black tailored suit, with toque
to match, and the Lewis lady wore black with
a wide-brimmed hat.
Hutchins School gym. was packed for the
hop promoted by the Combined Old Boys,
whose association represents all the G.P.S.
His Ex. attended, and in the official party were
Oberlin Harris, head of Hutchins, and his wife
and Mr. and Mrs. Dennis Butler. The Gov-
ernor presented football trophies, and pretty
frocks and youthful faces were to be seen every-
where.
Newnham Racing Club’s spring meeting fell
on a day of drizzle. Attendance was smaller
than usual and feminine dressing was a matter
of topcoats and sensible little hats. Among
those who did roll up were Dr. and Mrs. G. E.
Clemons, Mrs. and Miss Murphy, Mrs. F. War-
land Browne, the C. W. B. Martins, the J. E.
Thynes and Mrs. Holyman.
Launceston Show was blessed with fine
weather, and the grounds at Elphin looked their
best after the good rains. His Ex. and Lady
Clark were there. Barbara Bennett, riding her
horse Alert, was a prize-winner in ring events.
Launceston’s Mayoress mobilised representa-
tives of various women’s welfare organisations
to meet Lady Clark at the Virginia tea-rooms,
where pink tulips and masses of pansies decked
the tables.
At the finish of the golf matches in the
North, King’s Meadows players entertained the
visitors at a merry hop in the clubhouse. The
lights had gold-colored shades, and the whole
decorative scheme was in the same key.
Peggy, only daughter of Mrs. J. L. Whitham
and stepdaughter of Col. Whitham, Anglesea
Barracks, is exhibiting a sparkler, the gift of
Dr. Eric Langley, of Melbourne.
Betty Giblin is home again after some months
in England and a sojourn in South Africa with
her sister, Mrs. Lethbridge, whose husband is
private secretary to Australia’s former naval
commander, Rear-Admiral Evans, now at
Simonstown.
Mrs. C. Hogarth, who has been in the Old
World for the last six months, is back in
Launceston. She spent some time with her hus-
band’s folk in Scotland.

"/^iARD it well ere ye begin”. . . . When that old
song was written wool was carded that is to
say, the fibres prepared for spinning by hand.
The "Cards” were oblong wooden tools with short
curved handles and faces studded with wire pins.
Used in pairs, they were brushes with which the raw
wool was teased into a continuous sliver.
PROGRESS.....AND YARRA FALLS
Hand carding was a slow and laborious process. It
was in use when Australia was discovered. . . .before >
Australian wool was sought the world over. . . .before t
Australian woollens and worsteds had made their J
name. To-day we have progressed. Australia is the
world’s greatest wool-producing country, and at Yarra
Falls Mills the largest textile mills in the Southern
Hemisphere the great carding engines deal with
£5000 worth of wool every week. . . . "That, when
woven, dressed and clean, it may be cleadfu’ [beauti-
ful] for a Queen.”
WEALTH OF A NATION
Here, in Yarra Falls Mills, is the visible wealth of
a nation. The wealth of wool.... Australia’s great
primary industry (Yarra Falls uses 18,000 bales
annually) .... The wealth of woollens. . . .Australia s
great secondary industry (Yarra Falls production
capacity is 2,500,0001bs. of yarn and 1,750,000 yards
of woven fabrics every year).
Every process in scouring, carding, combing, spinning,
weaving, dyeing, milling.... from the raw, greasy
wool to the finished material, “cleadfu’ for a Queen
... .or King. . . .is here carried out.
The wool is scoured; carded the fibres opened out
and intermingled, and all dust and impurities re-
moved; and combed all fibres of less than a certain
length extracted, the long fibres being the ‘‘tops,’
the short ones the “noils.”

BY T. B. CLEGG.
UT IAR!” The blocked letters on the
news poster fixed the Major’s
eyes.
With a twist of his grey moustache he
muttered “Parliamentary compliments!
Good God!”
He stood, tall and straight, bare-
headed despite a drizzling rain, before
the Cenotaph in Martin-place, heedless
of the passers to and fro and of the clus-
tered folk around the postal boxes in
that ever-pulsing heart of Sydney. They,
too, were heedless of him ; heedless also
of the slight-figured, fair-haired woman
placing a handful of flowers on the
stone. After a momentary pause she re-
turned to him.
It was Memory Day. Never a
month passed but they went through this
simple ritual of remembrance, though
they rarely spoke of him—the man in
whose memory the little offering was
tendered, the frank, laughter-loving,
clear-eyed man who had been her lover
and her life, until that day at Pozieres.
They lunched at what the Major had
christened “The Seventh Heaven,” a
quiet tearoom on the seventh floor of a
block of business flats. It was cosy, with
snow-white napery and brightly-colored
drapings ; and its tariff was such as a
modest purse could bear. Through the
windows they could see the sky with its
drifting clouds, and hear beneath them
the subdued roar of the city. A city
office prisoned Margaret.
“You were late. Did the doctor keep
you?”
“Had to wait his pleasure, m’dear —or
hers. One of those child-women you
meet these days. She smiled and said
‘Sorry,’ and she looked happy.”
“I suppose the doctor had heartened
her up.”
“S’pose so. That seems to be the
greater part of their business these days
—next to the fee.”
“And what did he say about your-
self?”
“Told me to go on taking the medi-
cine and not to worry. Might live ten
years; but mustn’t worry, and must take
medicine.”
“And you left feeling as happy as the
little woman?”
“No, m’dear. I believe the fellow
knows but won’t tell—just puts me off
with what is practically a lie.”
“Even if he did, father, it would only
be in kindness. And you really may live
for ten years.”
“That’s the wobbling sort of argu-
ment a woman uses, Margaret. As if
kindness could make a lie anything but
a lie. Don’t seem to know the difference
between truth and a lie in this genera-
tion.”
“Yet I’ve heard you say a gentleman
would swear his soul away to save a
woman’s name.”
“Different, Margaret, quite different.
A matter of honor.”
“And the other is a matter of heart.
It would hurt dreadfully if one always
told the naked truth.”
“It would have hurt my naked skin
dreadfully if I had lied to my father.
What this century is suffering from,
m’dear, is moral anaemia. It needs a
tonic. To commence with lies is to
end with murders. Look at America!
In the old Queen’s day”
“Well,” said Margaret, rising, for office
hours refused to be thrust aside for
ethical discussions, “it seems to me to
be a sort of relativity: all our lies are
relative to the position of the liar in
facts and circumstances. A bit obscure,
1 admit; but so is Einstein.”
A week later, in the closing days of
winter, the two sat before the fire in
their little bungalow. Against living in
a flat the Major had protested emphati-
cally. At the back was a bit of land
where he could garden. The vegetables
he grew cost thrice their market price ;
but, as Margaret said, it gave him “an
interest.” Unveraciously she praised the
spindly radishes and the marble-sized
tomatoes.
The Major had been reading. He set
aside the book to refill his pipe from the
jar on the little table by the side of the
club chair that had served him from
the days when his wife and he had set
up their first Australian home.
Margaret, their only child, was but a
toddler when they came to this land of
cheap living, as it then was, to make the
most of the Major’s pension. He had
married late in life, and his wife, never
robust and further enervated by the years
in India, failed to respond to the change,
and faded out of existence almost as un-
obtrusively as she had entered into it,
leaving a trail of medical fees.
The Major, his pipe recharged, gazed
in silence into the fire, then sighed un-
consciously.
“Penny, father.”
“Not worth it, m’dear ; though, indeed,
I’ve been counting our pence. 1 s’pose
we’ll have to retrench again, eh?”
Margaret glanced at the dress on her
lap she was remoulding to the fashion.
“I’ve been balancing my budget—first
a salary cut and now rationing. It’s
lucky the exchange on your pension
makes up a bit.”
For a time the Major smoked in
silence. Of course she knew, though
he’d never told her directly. “You know
my pension dies with me, Margaret?”
“Yes, I’ve known it for years. That’s
why we’ve been scratching and saving,
isn’t it?”
“I wonder,” remarked the Major as
he knocked the ashes from his pipe, “if
the economists and financiers who talk
in millions —other people’s millions—
know what it means to persons like our-
selves to save a thousand pounds.”
“I wonder,” she repeated.
“And after all the pinching and dam’
cheeseparing what’s the result? Invested
in shares as good as gilt-edged, so the
broker said, we have now a doubtful
five hundred or thereabout. And that’s
all, with these few sticks of furniture,
1 you’ll get when I am dead, m’dear.
Ought to have insured myself years and
years ago, but I always thought you’d
marry. As you would have done....
only for the war.”
For some minutes the only sound was
the clink of spent coal falling from the
fire. Then the Major broke the silence
with the familiar tap-tap of his pipe
against the ashtray.
“If,” at last said Margaret dreamily,
“if only we could have some sort of luck
—win a sweep, perhaps.”
“I knew a man who won a Calcutta
sweep” began the Major.
“Yes, father, you’ve told me ; drank
himself to death, ran off with a general’s
wife, cut his throat, or did something
just as dreadful.”
“That was another man ; but it doesn’t
matter. Don’t like these Government
lotteries, Margaret; they’re too Conti-
nental. In the old days we did that sort
of thing when we went on the Continent,
but never at home, m’dear.”
“Well, I wouldn’t care if it were a
Soviet sweep provided I won and got the
money.”
“If you won! But, there, I don’t like
the idea. Deuced bad form to run a
Government lottery in a British country.”
“Form or no form, let’s dream of
what we’d do with the money if I did
win. You may speak first, father. Even
nowadays daughters sometimes allow
that to fathers.”
“Wouldn’t do anything with it.”
“But” —-—
“Wouldn’t touch a penny of it. There’s
only one thing it ever could do for me.”
“And that’s”
“Lay the ghost.”
“The ghost?”
“Yes, m’dear. Like Hamlet’s father,
it’s a walking ghost. Comes every night
and sits on the edge of my bed and
grins at me. Asks me what’s going to
become of her when I am dead.”
Margaret rose and rested her hand
caressingly on the bent shoulders.
The Major lifted his gaze from the fire
to the face shining down on him, trying
to twist out of his own the traces of
emotion. He patted her hand.
“There, there, m’dear, of course it’s
only a dream. Let’s laugh at it. Though,
indeed, if . I were a praying man, Mar-
garet, I’d pray for it. Our mother taught
us to pray. Peter and I used to race at
night who’d finish first. But I haven’t
said a prayer since I was a subaltern. It
seemed to me that thrusting one’s
trumpery affairs under the nose of the
I Almighty was an impertinence. A man
kept his affairs to himself in the Army.”
|. ■ .
A month later they were again in “The
i Seventh Heaven.” The Major was feeling
: a little ruffled. On the way to the city
an over-familiar tram passenger had
addressed him as “Dad,” and the con-
ductor had passed off on him four
ha’pennies in change. He hated “Dad.”
In his day when a child got beyond
“Papa” it said “Father” or “Sir.”
Never had the abode of tranquillity
and plain cooking looked more charm-
ing. The year was singing its spring
song. Sunshine and the fragrance of
flowers, wallflowers that carried the

The Autumn Season
The Autumn Season September to November is a
fascinating time. The weather is ideal, crisp and clear
and the countryside is a mass of variegated colours
Maples and Copper Beeches in their red and golden tints,
and gorgeous Chrysanthemums everywhere.
In addition to these natural charms, the Australian £, owing
to the low exchange, is worth 25/- in Japan. Tourists can
secure the advantage of this in their purchase of Silk,
Curios, etc., and their personal expenses ashore.

Major back to his boyhood and his Eng-
lish home, filled the room.
But what was up with Margaret? Her
cheeks were flushed, her eyes bright and
her voice had a slightly higher pitch
than usual.
The Major narrowed his eyes and
looked at her critically. She caught the
glance and flashed another back, a
glance that might have been maternal
in its fulness of affection.
Their orders given, he put the ques-
tion bluntly, “What’s in the wind, Mar-
garet? You’ve been in a most unusual
mood since we met? Never remember
you like this —not since you were a girl.
Then you used to fling your arms round
my neck and crush my collar.”
“I’ll tell you when we settle down and
the girl goes.... There, she’s gone now
and I can’t keep it to myself a moment
longer. It came this morning—the news.
Now hold up—don’t spill your tea. I’ve
—l’ve won a prize in a sweep!”
The Major carefully—over-carefully—
removed his pince-nez and rubbed the
lenses with a corner of his silk handker-
chief. “Steady, my boy, steady! ” he
counselled himself; “perhaps it’s only a
little one.”
Margaret noticed a tremor in the hand
that replaced the glasses. “Now, you
mustn’t get excited,” she said; “you
know how bad it is for you.”
“M’dear, I’m as cool as a cucumber ;
can’t you see it?”
“Well, then, quite ready? It’s —it’s
the first prize, the five thousand?”
The Major swayed in his chair and
fingered at its sides to steady himself.
“Margaret,” he gasped, “ask the waitress
to get a half-bottle of claret —decent
wine, the best. I feel as though we
needed it. Your wine, of course.”
It was a moment for explanation. How
was it that Margaret’s name did not
appear in the newspapers?
That, and much more, she explained.
The accountant at the office had managed
it all. The address was the firm’s P.O.
box, and the name her own second name,
her mother’s. It was all quite easily done
and there would be no publicity. As the
Major was wholly ignorant of such
matters, she had little trouble in satisfy-
ing him.
It took some time to settle the ques-
tion of what was to be done with the
£5OOO, and nightly Margaret brought
home suggestions from that source of in-
spiration the accountant. In the mean-
time she reported that the money had
been banked.
“Consols,” said the Major. “Pity you
can’t put it in Consols. What’s the best
substitute? Commonwealth bonds. Invest
the lot in Commonwealth bonds.”
“And that,” said Margaret as she
assented, “disposes of the ghost.”
“It has done so already, m’dear. He
is well and truly laid. Last night I had
a beautiful dream. I’d been thinking
before I dropped asleep of a poet fellow,
dead and forgotten, who wrote about his
mother and death. It ran something like
this:
‘Sleep in peace till thy son
Creepeth down to thy breast.’
It’s odd how the two ends do meet in
a sort of circle. ‘Our little life is rounded
with a sleep’.... I dreamt we met again.
“She had a beautiful voice, Margaret,
sweet and low, as your song says, and
I heard her singing just as she used to
sing to lohn and Judy, Peter, Maria and
me All dead but Maria and me.”
They never ascended to “The Seventh
Heaven” together again. One night, as
was her habit, Margaret went into the
Major’s bedroom to see if he needed
anything before herself going to rest.
It was a simple, unadorned room, simple
as his habits. She kissed him on the
forehead and then switched off the light,
for, ill or well, he would have no light
at night. Next morning she rapped at
his door.
“Father, here’s your shaving water and
it’s past seven.”
Later she rapped again, but still no
answer, so she entered.
The Major’s grey head rested on the
pillow, motionless. Never again would
he call her “m’dear.” In the dawn of
day a tired-out son had slipped away
seeking again the arms of his mother.
The bungalow had new tenants. Mar-
garet had rented a small flat, high up, for,
so she found, the nearer Heaven the
lower the rent.
Six months had passed since she had
laid the Major by the side of his wife
and in that time she had settled down to
the life of a spinster, isolated though not
friendless.
She tried to banish all thought of the
future—she would let no ghost of that
kind haunt her nights. She would be
brave and take life as it came. Still,
there was the future. It would not be
scotched.
She had humor —that sympathetic
sense which balances between the light
and shade of human life. You could
see its expression in her face when she
thought of the supreme lie that had
brought peace to the Major’s soul. Had
death not settled it for her how could
she have sustained the deception year in,
year out? “Perhaps father was right,”
she mused, “and straight-out truth is best
in the end. Yet, it was a lovely lie —a
lovely lie —and it laid the ghost.”
Christmas had come and gone. Aunt
Maria had not received her annual letter.
Instead Margaret had written to tell her
of her brother’s death. Of the old lady,
now the last living member of the family
group, Margaret knew little beyond a
reference to her by the Major as the
only one of them all who had made
money out of matrimony. When the
acknowledgment came, Margaret felt
merely the curiosity aroused when one
spills ink with a stranger.
It was long and discursive, written in
the spidery hand of Victorian days. Not
at all easy to decipher. Also it was partly
autobiographical.
My first was not quite a success, so to
speak, but number two made up for it. A
most honorable gentleman, Margaret, and like
your dear father almost painfully truthful.
Carried it to extremes, indeed, for as you must
know, even in Australia, it is absolutely im-
possible for a woman in any kind of society
these days to be too pernickety in that way.
Not that I would for a moment condone a lie.
“Poor old dear,” thought Margaret,
“trying to run with the Victorian hare
and hunt with the twentieth-century
hounds.”
But when she came to the end of the
script she put it on her lap.
Could it really be?
She read the thing again.
Out of affection for her brother, her
last link with the past, and knowing ne
could have made little provision for
his daughter. Aunt Maria had settled on
her an annuity of £l5O.
Not a fortune, my child, but it may keep
you out of the poorhouse, or whatever they
call it in Australia. A dreadful country, l
should say. Infested with a Labor party, is
it not?
The reference to politics brought a
smile to Margaret’s face which the clos-
ing paragraph drove blankly away:
Of course, you say your prayers every night,
as I am sure your dear father did. Well,
always remember your Aunt Maria in them,
and that will be a quid pro quo, as they call it.
At all events, no harm can be done by calling
attention to my existence, and I’m getting really
old at last. You never know!
“A quaint sort of bargain,” said Mar-
garet to herself. “Prayers nightly, pay-
ment quarterly. But I’ll keep to it truly,
you dear old soul.”
And that night she prayed for Aunt
Maria.
Sea-fog.
These pale, cold arms are lifted from the sea,
Arms of the mist. How clammily they hold
The last bright coins of sunset! Smothering
gold
With an uncanny whiteness; this green tree
Is meshed in floating webs; the fickle bush
Has donned a novice veil, its gipsy reds
Drowned in chill purity; the flower-beds
Are overlaid with billowing fog; a hush
Has fallen on the shrillness of the day.
Figures loom eerily; a human call,
Arrested, dies against the baffling wall
Of cloud, drawn shorewards from the unseen
bay.
And, as we meet beneath the dripping tree,
Creep closer to my heart, but speak not loud:
Dead men are here who never knew a shroud,
And broken ships drift inland from the sea !
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
Among the Tea-tree.
I have put off my cares and come to be
One with the earth, one with each bird and
tree,
One with the sky and pale, quiescent sea.
O shining morn! O beauty burning bright!
This is my lovely place of old delight!
The tea-tree, grey and gaunt of limb,
Is young again,
And roofed in white;
Is roofed in shapes of glistening white.
The wind blows warm down every little glade
That lies behind the hummocks’ heaped-up
sand;
The blossoming honey-bush is hot with sun;
And look! green-islanded in purple shade,
The bracken-fronds are opening one by one;
And where the vanished orchids hung their
heads,
The tarnished gold of crazy cape weed spreads.
Hark now!
Hark now!
Far on the highest bough,
The thrush sings loud and louder in his glee.
The blackbird, like a wayward lover,
Whistles wildly from his cover,
And gulls ghost-white come wheeling from the
sea.
Beneath the hanging blue-veiled sky,
The slender honeyeaters fly,
Thin-billed among the buds and bells;
And high above the broken shells,
As pale as flowers in a dream,
The starry-eyed beach-daisies gleam
Through silver seeds of clematis.
O piercing bliss!
O wordless pain!
I am close, close to spring again!
I have put off my cares and come to be
One with the earth, one with each bird and tree,
One with the sky and pale, quiescent sea.
VICTORIA.

Suffer Little Children.
BY J. H. M. ABBOTT.
PRETTY Mrs. Meredith, fair and girlish
and rosy-cheeked, walked along
the south shore of Port Hunter
(close by where the Newcastle Company’s
steamers berth each dawn and sail each
midnight in these days) and admired the
view of the harbor’s mouth and the long
sweep of the sands curving north-east-
ward towards Morna Point, nearly
twenty miles away.
She was dressed in white muslin, and
was the only dainty human thing in
the landscape. The red coat of the
sentry on the jetty of the King’s Wharl
made a splash of color against the blue
waters of the wide estuary, and his
bayonet flashed and sparkled in the
glorious sunlight against the clear sky.
Two schooners and a brig were an-
chored out in the stream, and white gulls
floated in fleets about them on the placid
waters. Out beyond the Coal Island —
then really an island —the deep Prussian
blue of the curving horizon made a sharp
line against the paler blue of the sky,
and up the green hills on her right
straggled the town towards the slender
spire of Christ Church on the first
summit.
A queer little place was Newcastle
then. Barracks for soldiers, barracks for
prisoners ; the gaol, storehouse and gran-
aries, worksheds; the cottages of civil
and military officials and the few free
inhabitants ; huts of convicts straggling
about almost anyhow —strangely unlike
the great and busy city that stands in its
place to-day. But if it were possible to
forget that it was a severe and unpre-
tentious penal settlement, populated
mainly by some of the worst of the
secondary convicted prisoners of the
Crown, it had a charm of its own.
It was necessary to shut out from sight
the gangs of ironed men who toiled on
the breakwater building out towards
Nobby’s, marched morning and evening
to and from the coalmines, or handled
the great cedar logs that came floating
down the river in rafts from the country
above the Williams and the Paterson.
Still, it was very beautiful —just as it
is to-day, if you forget certain aspects
of the scenery that insist upon confront-
ing you—and Mrs. Meredith never tired
of admiring the river and the sea out-
side and the dark mangrove belts up-
stream and the blue ranges far away
beyond Port Stephens.
It was almost her only recreation, ad-
miring the view. There was not much
to occupy the plentiful spare time of a
young married woman who had no child-
ren and whose husband was hard at
work all day.
Just now the Commandant’s family
were away in Sydney ; the doctor and the
chaplain and Mr. Courtney, command-
ing the detachment of the “Buffs,” were
bachelors ; Mrs. Smellie, the wife of the
superintendent of convicts, drank and
was otherwise impossible, so that so far
as companionship with her own sex
counted Fanny Meredith was cut off
from all society at Newcastle. There
were, of course, the wives of the soldiers
and the overseers ; but the lady of the
officer of Royal Engineers in charge of
the construction of the breakwater was
necessarily as high above that sort of
unacknowledgeable female as an angel
is above the dwellers in the Bottomless
Pit.
Her walks were severely circumscribed
by the fact that her husband had for-
bidden her to wander alone out of sight
of a sentry. Indeed, for a young and
pretty woman to have done so would
have been to court nameless and terrible
disaster. There were always vagrant
blackfellows from the camps about the
outskirts of the settlement, and brutes
amongst the convicts living out of bar-
racks, whose very presence at the Hunter
River was accounted for by their having
come across unprotected females in
lonely places. So she might only indulge
in fresh air and exercise along the shore
of the harbor, about the town or in the
vicinity of the breakwater, where there
were always guards and fixed bayonets
within sight and hail.
On the whole, the Engineer officer’s
wife, she used laughingly to chaff her
husband, was as much a prisoner as any
who were officially classed as such in the
muster roll of the inhabitants of New-
castle
“My dear,” he would say protestingly,
“so am I. So is the Major. So are we
all. Some day, please God, this job ot
throwing stones into the sea will be com-
pleted or abandoned. And when I get
my captaincy some other poor devil will
have to come here and play the slave-
driver.”
Major Morrissett was very kind. He
was always inviting her to accompany
him on his trips up the river in his barge
when he went to inspect the outlying
settlements along its banks as far as
the Greenhills (Morpeth) and Wallis
Plains (Maitland). She had been on one
once with her husband. But the sight ot
the triangles rigged in the bows was not
a pleasant one, and the necessity of going
ashore and taking a walk into the bush
whenever they halted at a farm or cedar-
getter’s camp where the Major was
called upon to dispense the justice of the
cat-o’-nine-tails was a little depressing.
It was not nice to see, on their return
to the boat, a couple of the crew swab-
bing up blood from the gratings for’ard
or the hideous-looking scourger cleans-
ing the thongs of his awful implement.
This afternoon she had come down to
meet her husband, and was slowly walk-
ing seaward towards the breakwater that
was beginning to push its way slowly and
toilsomely out towards the island. He
would leave his work an hour or two
earlier than usual, and they were to go
for a good tramp southward along the
cliffs in the direction of Sydney. Such
excursions were all too rare, lor his
work, as he put it himself, “kept his nose
to the sandstone” ; and she was eagerly
looking forward to so much relief as
this from a monotony and loneliness that
oppressed her more than she ever let
him see, or, to do him justice, than he
ever suspected.
Down where they were quarrying into
the high bluff whereon Fort Scratchley
stands to-day for stone to build the
breakwater, little toiling figures .of men
moved about their bitter tasks in the
slow, resentful fashion that always char-
acterises prison labor. Round about
them were the red coats of the cordon
of sentries who watched them at their
work, and guaranteed (he safety of the
overseers who drove them without
mercy.
Somewhere down there was Lieutenant
John Meredith, R.E., watching and
supervising what always seemed to his
wife to be one of the tasks of Hercules.
In the twelve months that they had been
in Newcastle it seemed to her that the
embankment had scarcely advanced
twenty feet into the swirling waters that
seemed to swallow hungrily every hand-
cartful of broken stone that was tipped
over the end of the bank by the little
crews of convicts, who dragged and
pushed them ceaselessly from the quar-
ries, without showing any abatement of
their ravenous appetite. She sighed as
she thought of the task that had been
set her husband, and wondered if it ever
would be finished.
It was a great work undoubtedly —she
had heard him say so —but so endless,
so cruel and so slow! Well, men were
patient creatures. Little doubt of that.
She was standing on a grassy bank a
hundred yards on the seaward side of
the wharf, above the narrow strip of
sandy beach that ran in a curving line
along this side of the harbor, idly gazing
out to sea, and turning, a little im-
patiently, every now and then to look in
the direction whence her husband was
to come. She knew she was before her
time, and that he was the soul of punc-
tuality—but nevertheless was conscious
of some feeling of vague impatience.
Suddenly she became aware of the sound
of voices, children’s voices, somewhere
close at hand.
A little way down the beach was a
roughly-built boatshed —a humpy of
slabs and sheets of bark which shel-
tered the crazy craft of old Paddy O’Raf-
ferty, the Commandant’s fisherman. It
was from the further side of this that
the shrill trebles and falsettos came. She
would move along the bank and watch
the children playing. It would do some-
thing towards passing the time until her
husband came.
A few paces brought her in sight of
a little group of very earnest urchins who
were enacting one of those child dramas
which have been played since man came
into his tenancy of the earth —which the
young of all animals play in imitation
of their elders.
There were four small boys and a
red-haired little girl. They were all bare-
footed, barelegged and bareheaded, and
their clothing was the very minimum of
decency. In the case of the little girl
it was hardly even that, for her sole gar-
ment was a scanty frock that seemed to
leave her more naked than if she had
been altogether in the nude. As she
danced about the group of boys in wild
excitement the very aspect of her lithe
young body suggested that she would

have been less undressed had she been
undressed altogether.
Mrs. Meredith—of a generation that
considered Nature a little indecent —
blushed, but the entire absence of any
suggestion of immodesty in the child’s
behavior, and curiosity as to the strange
game that was being played, soothed her
qualms of conscience.
It was, indeed, a queer kind of play,
and at first she did not grasp its meaning.
The biggest of the boys, a sandy,
lreckled fellow, who could scarcely have
been more than ten years old, was evi-
dently master of ceremonies and director
of the revels. Two pieces of timber
leant against the wall of the boatshed,
their top ends meeting in an angle and
the lower extremities a yard apart. To
them was tied by wrists and ankles
with strands of seaweed the smallest
of the party, minus his shirt, which lay
on the ground between his feet. Another
boy stood behind grasping a short stick,
to which were fastened several pieces of
the same brown seaweed that strewed the
length of the beach and tinged the air
with its salty odors. The fourth urchin
shouldered a stick. Very obviously a
soldier on guard.
“Now then, yous ” (Mrs. Meredith
shuddered), “we’ll start th’ game. V’
knows wotcher gotter do—an’ don’ lergit.
Me, I m th’ ole Majah. Young Micky,
’e’s th’ pris’ner. Tommy’s th’ sentry.
Bill’s th’ flogger ; Ned, th’ Bos’n. Now
I talks to th’ pris’ner. Pris’ner’’ he began,
when he was interrupted by a shrill and
mdignant squealing from the little girl.
“00-00-oo ! Charlie, y’ve lef’ me out.”
Impatiently, the stage-manager turned
to rebuke and placate his leading lady—
as so many stage-managers have had to
do, before and since.
“Oh you, Cissy Maginnis, shut up!
You’re the crowd wots lookin’ on. That’ll
do for you.”
Aw, go to ’ell—l don’t want ter be
no crowd. I want to be somebody. 1
will be somebody, real. I ain’t a-goin’ to
be no blarsted crowd.”
The worried Charles considered the
situation for a moment or two.
“Orright, yer little witch ; you can be
a lady. You can be Mrs. Meredith. Will
that do ye?”
Squeals of delight from the actress,
who immediately picked up a lump of
putrid seaweed, dabbed it on her red
nob, and assumed a pose of prim aloof-
ness, her snub nose in the air, her wide
mouth screwed up tightly, and her grimy
hands folded over her stomach.
Through her tears, the real Mrs. Mere-
dith could scarcely help smiling.
“Now, then, git ready,” cried the actor-
manager, swelling out his chest and
standing stiff and rigid in ridiculously
realistic imitation of the Commandant’s
most official pose.
He paused a moment to cast a critical
eye over his company.
“Orright. Pris’ner,” he growled gruffly,
"you have — ah—been sentenced be th’
Coort to receive two ’und’ed lashes.
Scourger—-do yer jooty ! An’ you, Bill,
don’ you ’it young Micky proper. If yer
does ’lt th’ slabs. One!” he bel-
lowed.
The tousled Bill raised the seaweed
cat-o’-nine-tails over his right shoulder,
took a step back with his right foot and
then sprang forward, bringing the strands
of weed with a slap against the wall of
the boatshed.
“Yell, yell!” the Commandant admon-
ished the prisoner. “D n ye—that
’urt ye!” Two!” he assumed Major
Morrissett’s gruff tones again.
The prisoner received, or was sup-
posed to receive, the second lash of his
severe, though not uncommon, sentence.
Completely, now, did Mrs. Meredith
realise the dreadful nature of the chil-
dren’s play. The overwhelming horror of
it filled her gentle bosom with anguish.
She dropped her pink parasol and fell
on her knees, covering her face with her
hands. She had never seen a flogging,
but she had shudderingly heard stories
of them from her convict maidservants,
and knew that these children were acting
the grim scene with all possible faithful-
ness. How many such awful sights must
these babies have witnessed to play their
parts so well! Hangings, too, no doubt,
they must have seen. And such little
things.
All the starved motherhood of a child-
less wife filled her with loving pity for
these poor mites, who used the most
dreadful language.
Major Morrissett, she knew, had the
reputation of being a tremendous flogger,
a thorough believer in the efficacy of
the “cat.” Dick, her husband, had told
her how sick he was of the daily flagel-
lations of great batches of men for the
most trivial offences —possession of
tobacco, failing to salute overseers, and
so on. How he hated to reprimand a
man for idling on the breakwater even,
knowing well that, if any of his slave-
drivers heard him speak to a prisoner, the
man’s very soul might be flogged out of
him! Sometimes prisoners died at the
triangles. “This breakwater,” Dick had
said once in a bitter moment, “when it
is finished, will have been cemented with
blood and curses!”
She remembered a remark of the Com-
mandant’s Dick had overheard him make
to the captain of a man-o’-war which
had lain in Port Hunter.
“Dear me, Major,” Captain Bayly had
said, “you do seem to have an extra-
ordinary amount of punishment—of flog-
ging—here! Our service is pretty strict
—pretty severe as to discipline—but,
really”
Major Morrissett had laughed in his
bluff and genial fashion. “Perhaps so,
my dear sir. I have a good deal of faith
in the cat. But, on the other hand, we
don’t have many executions. Plenty of
lash and no rope, if possible—that’s my
motto. Whip a man, and you can work
him afterwards. But hang him—and
where are you?”
And yet the Major was not a brutal
man, surely! A good husband. A kind
father. A gentleman. But these children
—these poor little waifs! This dreadful
business was so common to them that
they actually played at it!
“Hallo there, Fanny—whatever are
you doing?”
It was her husband’s voice. Hastily,
she scrambled to her feet —noticing that
the children had scampered into cover
behind the boatshed —and picked up her
parasol. She turned to meet him, dab-
bing at her eyes under cover of the
sunshade.
With her husband was the Rev,
Reginald Morland, the Church of Eng-
land chaplain, a somewhat unctuous
gentleman, whom, somehow, she had
never been able to appreciate so fully as
she knew she ought.
As the two of them came forward,
Mr. Morland lifted his hat and bowed,
exclaiming blandly:
“Ah, my dear Mrs. Meredith, making
friends with our bonny little folk, eh?
Charming, delightful! And so Christian.
You remember our blest Redeemer’s
words? ‘Suffah little children—ah—to
come unto Me, for of such is the King-
dom of Heaven!’ Oh, bee-utiful!”
With a little moan she went to her
husband.
“Oh, Dick, take me home. I am not
well.”
Kingfish.
BY VANCE PALMER.
PRIDE of life was tingling in Gessler’s
blood as the little boat swung back
to the island, dipping her nose to
the southerly swell. He had got among
the first of the kingfish. Over half a
ton of them were lying in the iceboxes
below, and the decks were still slippery
with blood and scales. The thrill of
hauling them in at the rate of one a
minute was rippling through the muscles
of Gessler’s body, for though he had been
ten years at the game he had never lost
his youthful excitement at striking the
first shoal that came sweeping north at
the end of May.
“I got among the kingfish,” he wanted
to tell Anna. “Twenty quids’ worth in
that lot. None of the other fellows were
expecting them for weeks yet, so they’ll
be the first on the market.”
It was like a gift from the gods, for
he had been five days out along the reef
and was coming home with nearly empty
iceboxes when one of the trailing lines
sang taut and a silvery shape leapt high
out of the water. From then on there

“There! Making for the mainland.
Looks like one of the bulls.”
Gessler went to his bunk to get his
glasses. He was a little short-sighted,
for years of tropic sun glare had taken
the virgin keenness from his eyes. There
was a flicker of uncertainty in his fingers
as he felt under the pillow of his bunk.
He didn’t like the thought of bulls hang-
ing about the island when Anna and the
boy were there alone.
“Here, you see who it is,” he said to
Verney.
The young fellow trained the glasses
on the faint smudge of sail that was
making for the mainland. There were
at least a hundred boats lying in the
mangrove-reaches and backwaters of the
port, but Verney knew every one.
“Looks like the Seahawk,” he said.
“Low-cut masts and turtle beam. .. . You
knew Black Nelson’s out again?”
“No.”
“Well, it’s so. Got a month knocked
off his sentence for something or other.
Like most of these bulls, Nelson is—
tame as a guinea pig behind the bars.
Only a terror when he’s among his own
crowd.”
A queer look came to Gessler’s eyes.
For a moment his body wilted ; all the
exuberance seemed to seep out of it.
“Get a move on,” he said to Verney.
“We won’t get there till dark at this
rate.”
Left alone in the bows, he kept his
glasses trained on the Seahawk till it
almost seemed that the figure of Black
Nelson swam into his vision. Massive
head, small eyes glinting through their
folds of flesh like a pig’s, white teeth
gleaming like shells from the dark of
his face! And always that childlike
grin! Except when something crossed
him, then his features became distorted
and madness gushed through him in a
torrent.
“The brute!” thought Gessler. “They
ought to have kept him behind the bars
for good. Or else sent him back to where
he comes from.”
He was thinking of the scene in court
when he had given evidence about Nel-
son dynamiting fish along the reef. The
fellow had been cocky at first, as if he
had thought the whole proceedings a
joke. Then suddenly the blood had
rushed to his head in one of his storms.
Gessler had just caught his throaty
rumble:
“All right, Gessler. I get you when
I come out By cripes, I get you!”
It was an incident in a long feud. All
the fishermen disliked the big Darnley
Islander, but they took care not to come
to grips with him. There was some queer
power about him ; he was not like the
other bulls ; it was just as well not to
rouse that passion that swept over him
like a cyclone. But Gessler, alone on
his island, had despised such caution.
“Think I’m going to let him walk
over me like he does over that piebald
crowd in Luggertown? No. fear! I’ll
show the brute where he belongs.”
Yet it was not his evidence about the
dynamiting that had sent Nelson down
for a long spell. He would have been
let off with a fine if he had kept his
hands off the policeman who brought
him the summons. That barbaric temper
of his had compassed his downfall this
time as so often before.
They swept into the empty lagoon,
but there was no sign of life about the
cottage, nestling under its spreading
beach-hibiscus. Gessler expected to see
young Peter racing along the beach, be-
side himself with excitement at the sight
of the familiar boat nosing through the
channel. Perhaps the sore foot that had
been troubling him five days before kept
him in the house.
“I’ll just go ashore for a word with
Anna,” he told Verney. “Then we’ll
make out again for the mainland.”
Yet there was a little wisp of fear at
his heart as he took the flattie and rowed
ashore. No smoke coming up from the
chimney! Usually Anna saw him from
half a dozen miles away, find had a fire
going with hot coffee on the hob. He
would barrack her about her failing eye-
sight.
“Have to get you a pair of glasses, old
girl. Thought you’d be worrying because
I wasn’t home two days ag0.... Well,
anyway we didn’t come back empty. Got
among the kingfish.”
Footprints of bare feet in the sand,
stillness among the terns that stood in
rows just above the line of the tide, heavy
silence all round the island. Gessler tried
to cloak his uneasiness as he threw the
flattie’s anchor into the shallows and
scrambled ashore. More than once he
had felt he was leaving Anna too much
alone ; had tried to persuade her to bring
her sister over from the mainland. But
Anna had only laughed.
“What are you scared of, Harry?
Think someone’s going to run off with
me? Don’t worry. I can look after
myself.”
She had no qualms about the lugger-
boys or colored fishermen who some-
times came to the island. They brought
her clams and cowries, and she some-
times gave them samples of the brownie
she had cooked. It was impossible to
make her believe that even the big Darn-
ley Islander was as black as he was
painted. There had been a sneaking
sympathy for him in her comments when
she heard he was sent down.
All this was in Gessler’s mind as he
hurried up the path towards the closed
door. A little later he was racing about
the island, coo-eeing, calling, beside him-
self with panic. There was no answer
from the tropic jungle that covered the
twenty acres of coral sand. The only
response came from the terns that rose
up in flocks, filling the air with their
rusty crying.
Verney, leaning ill-at-ease over the
rails, saw his chief race down to the
flattie and drive it with wild strokes
back to the boat.
“What’s wrong?” he hailed him from
twenty yards away.
Gessler’s reply was like the grunt of
an animal wounded to the death.
“Get the engine going.... Quick!”
He had two images before his inner
vision. One was Anna’s frightened face ;
the other was the queer, piggish gleam
in Black Nelson’s eyes. As a child he
remembered seeing a picture of the devil
in the family Bible. It hadn’t been at
all like Black Nelson, but now the two
had merged in one. Evil embodied! Why
hadn’t they all joined together years ago
to hunt the brute out of his den in Lug-
gertown?
All through the two hours’ journey he
sat in the bows, staring straight ahead of
him. Verney hardly dared to ask him
a question; fears of what they might
discover were gathering round his own
heart. Clouds the hue of bruised flesh
darkened the horizon, heralds of a storm
working up from the south. But the
lights of Port Cowdray were pricking
the dusk ahead, coming out one by one
as they chugged down the staked channel
to the wharves.
At the back of Gessler’s brain a sinis-
ter voice was repeating the same words
over and over:
“I get y0u.... By cripes, I get you.”
He hardly saw anything that was real.
He didn’t answer when the handful of
fishermen on the wharves hailed him
across the water. His mind was leaping
ahead ; his clenched fingers were meet-
ing round an imaginary throat.
Suddenly in the dusk he saw a big
figure come swaggering down to the
wharf, black head bare, mouth open in
a grin. The rolling walk, the jaunty
swing of the hips, were those of a tri-
umphant animal. For the last two hours
Gessler’s nerves had been strung taut,
and now they seemed to snap with a jerk.
With a low growl he ran along the deck
and sprang across the ten feet of water.
“Look out!” someone shouted.
For Gessler had miscalculated the leap.
He balanced for a moment on the edge
of the wharf, swayed crazily and then
before the outstretched hands could
clutch him fell backward, his head strik-
ing the rails of the boat.
Ten hours later, waking in the ward of
the hospital, he was aware of a slow
voice going on and on. His head seemed
stuffed with cotton-wool; he could hardly
connect one sentence with another. But
he was dimly aware of having been at
the bottom of a dark pit, fighting with
demons. Or was it on the sea-floor ten
fathoms down? He remembered there
had been weights on his feejt, that when
he had tried to clutch at his enemy’s
throat he couldn’t raise his arms.
“I ought to have left a note for you,”
Anna was saying, “but I was too flurried
to think. Peter’s foot got so bad I was
sure it was septic and my only thought
was to get him across to a doctor. When
Black Nelson’s boat came in, it seemed
too good a chance to miss.... You’ve got
too much of a set on Nelson, Harry. He’s
not so bad as they make out. I won’t
believe any of those tales about him from
now on.”
Her good-natured face, with its halo
of short, dark hair, had a light about it.
Gessler felt stupid, ashamed of what had
been going on in his mind’s inner dark-
ness. He was silent for a while, trying
to find reality. At last with an effort he
struggled towards it.
“We got among the kingfish,” he said.
“First this year. Must have been twenty
quid’s worth in the one lot, so it looks
as if we’ll be on velvet from now on.”
