HIS BOOKS
PHILIP GIBBS’S
AVUNCULAR
RAMBLING
Only that
p h y s i o 1 o g ical
masterpiece th e
journalistic mind
could have hit on
the ingenious
means of making a book that Sir Philip
Gibbs adopted for his European Journey
Sir Philip took a couple of friends in a
car over those parts of Europe that look
nearest to boiling-point, questioning as
he went “the common folk whose lives
are unrecorded and whose ideas are un-
expressed” to get at what these folk
think of the mess they’re in.
The plan seems about as poor as any
that could have been thought out. What
possible significance could there be in
the fruit of such a mission? It could
only indicate, as it actually does, that
the different kinds, classes and nationali-
ties of people would hold divergent
views on similar things-—a silly sort of
confusion to anthologise. Here and
there in the dialogues a remark that is
pungent, that crystallises, flashes out;
but for the, most part it makes a book
that will please honest Dick, good old
Tom and the egregious Harry, because
each can fasten on to what suits him.
If it stopped at that, it would be worth
exactly that much. It does go further.
Its shell is simply a bright journalistic
subterfuge. An honest, sincere work that
does not pander to mediocre intelligence
in Sir Philip’s own field, for instance,
such a book as Force, by Lord Davies—
misses the general mass of readers. So,
sensible man, Sir Philip coats the pill,
and he coats it thick. Under that coat-
ting lurks the truth that Sir Philip is
not the disinterested observer and re-
porter he pretends to be. There is a
theme to the thing; that of his Ways of
Escape, sung with a little more sugar in
the voice.
The book’s purpose, then, is to repeat
the belief that France can now take the
blame in advance for that next war. Sir
Philip believes—he believes it most
seriously—that Hitler’s offers of peace
are sincere ; that Europe’s troubles would
be virtually solved if France would take
hold on the genuine olive thus offered to
her. Failing this, he sees war in Europe
as a surer thing than a Cup winner after
the event, though he declines to specify
date of outbreak —“within ten years, or
after ten years,” is vague for a prophet
of these cocksure days.
On the way to reaching these conclu-
sions, he records all the generously wide
range of opinion he gathered regarding
government, conduct and conditions of
France, Italy, Austria and Germany, by
all manner of inhabitants of each, in-
cluding children, a cardinal and a drunk.
Taken largely, these utterances are too
journalistically facile to represent what
Sir Philip seems to think they do, a fac-
ing up to reality; but' they include good
things, such as the answers made by
men laboring on the palace which is to
house the League of Nations at Geneva:
“We’re not building a palace for the
League: a new hos-
pital for the wounded
of the next war” ; and
“This, monsieur, is a
barracks we are build-
ing. It will be ready
for occupation by the
Germans when they
march this way.”
One thing the book
does succeed in doing
is to give* a friendly
and sympathetic, if
superficial, picture of
the ordinary run of
people in the countries
visited. Particularly it
makes something like a
reality of the Italian
people and, perhaps
more opportunely, of
the German, against
w horn propaganda
Sir Philip Gibbs.
literature has been heavily loaded for
some time.
A POCKET
PEPYS OF
THESE DAYS
Sir Philip would
be applauded for
that last by the
odd fellow who
has -written A
Journal of These
Days, Albert Jay Nock, though Nock
would have to swallow a vast contempt
for journalists to utter it.
Nock is a diarist, sufficiently honest
to be a real one. In one aspect he is a
dabbler in incredibly piffling little super-
stitions: he sounds as if he’d drink a
cordial of bats’ wing and snails if his
black cook told him it would do him
good. This side of his character he dis-
plays with a naivete resembling Pepys’s
own; it stands side by side with com-
ments on public affairs, public men and
their trends and intentions, which, in
definitions, are downright and illuminat-
ing. Reading Sons and Lovers makes
him think Lawrence never washed behind
his ears ; bouillabaisse, a vastly over-
rated dish; the French press, “than
which there is nothing more mere-
tricious and subversive of all decency” ;
the League of Nations, a monstrous
humbug which never had any other pur-
pose or function than hoodwinking;
Coolidge, a trivial man of parochial
mind ; Arnold Bennett’s Journal, the jot-
tings of a huckster; Hoover, a base and
disgusting fellow; Prohibition, a vested
interest of great magnitude.
The book is packed with such stuff;
alive; the genuine revealing of a curious
and unusual mind.
A NOVEL THAT
MIGHT BE
CALLED GREAT
The muddle
which chiefly in-
terests the two
foregoing on-
lookers —they are
little more than
that comes in as a general surround
to the people who act out the incestuous
drama of Johann Rabener’s Condemned
to Live, as noble a
work of fiction as has
been printed this year:
one needs go back a
little further, to A
Glastonbury Romance,
to fit it into something
like its class.
That it seems greater
work than that of
Powys might mean
only that it has been
more recently read, and
is being written of
while the terrific power
of its last hundred
pages is a strange and
new experience. But
the preference may be
critically sounder than
that. One could hardly
feel about all that
pseudo - metaphysical
and Druidistical ornamentation and
luxuriance of Glastonbury that Powys
did much other than enjoy him-
self immensely, though it all gave his
book a size which is not in Rabener’s
narrow focus. On the other hand,
Rabener leaves the impression that he
burnt out a great deal of his life in
making his novel. There is no romance
here, unless we give the word a glory
so lacelike a word hardly deserves, and
read out of the last hundred pages, where
the whole significance of the novel lies,
a new and vital romance of united de-
liverance from a life that has come to
be a monstrous incest.
It hardly seems necessary to say more
about the novel than that it seems a great
one. It laughs sardonically at the idea
of a reviewer’s precis. Particularly, its
theme is one of evil of mother to son,
and, interlocked with that, a theme of
hereditary influences, in the description,
vindication and explanation of that son
and his destiny, by his past. In general,
it surveys German life from the begin-
ning of the century to about the present
day. The first half of it is ill-constructed
and clayey: on page 572 the author
makes belated amends with a cryptic “Un-
necessary to reproduce the whole of this
rather foolish dialogue.” A pity he
didn’t accept that at first.
Anyone may make what he likes of
the fact that one of the veiy few mis-
prints in the 600-odd pages is the spell-
ing of the word “wild” as “Wilde.”
There is one less-unintentional solecism:
the translators make the author say of a
racehorse that “as a two-year-old he had
won every preliminary canter, and was
now favorite for the most famous
German race,” which merits enshrine-
ment as a sporting classic beside Ouida’s
own.

The Passing
of Dead Dog
“The bush? Oh,
yes, it’ll be all
right when we’ve
cleared it well
away.” Such was
the outlook of
the pioneers, and they expressed it
by the names they left, like Dead Dog
Gully. To hear it expressed in such tones
nowadays, we have chiefly to turn to
the writings of Europeans.
So far I have not been able to see
any account of Australia written by an
Italian settler. It would be extraordi-
narily interesting. What I have in mind,
though, are pages in the French novels
of Paul Wenz and the German “Austra-
lian Sketches” by A. von Kotze. M. Wenz
has been writing his Australian novels,
mostly set in sheep country of N.S.W.,
any time during the past 30 years, a’
von Kotze died in 1909 after fairly wide
experience, especially in the northerly
parts of Australia. His book c -k , i si
was republished (sixteenth the :
late as 1925. Both writers, n;
French, the other German, see An, ,;
as an outcast:
A maid whom there were few
And very few to love.
Indeed, Von Kotze’s famous sonnet in
English, prefacing his book, begins “A
lone old maid.”
M. Wenz, setting his characteristic, al-
most diagrammatic, stories in a land-
scape devoid of all superfluous “pro-
perties,” has succeeded in giving his
stories a stark, almost macabre, veracity.
Well and good. Next, having for his
own purposes set his characters against
a bare background, he proceeds to dis-
cuss, as if it were an absolute and invari-
able fact of Australian life, the bareness

of that setting. In this he tells his own
truth. Even the very landscapes that he
chooses—the River Darling with its
milky-blue waters and few huge trees, or
a lonely and decaying bush township,
abandoned after a gold rush —can, for
those to whom they are familiar, possess
a certain beauty. For a European, how-
ever, whose childhood knew the smiling
Norman apple country, these new, crude
settlements can only be allowed to repre-
sent horror: and the characters of Paul
Wenz, in his most clear-cut stories, hardly
enter any regions in Australia that have
become sympathetic and human. It is
an excellent tonic to read books in which
this impression of our “haggard conti-
nent” is rendered competently and
frankly. It is a point of view.
It is the point of view of Von Kotze:
My two horses were quiet and well-fed.
And so I rode out into the new morning.
But although the whole world lay open
before me and I was inspired by a desire
for adventure and by freedom, still some-
thing was missing, something that in the
bush is always missing, namely, the instinc-
tive sense of joy in living, thankfulness for
one’s very breath. In the air of the most
superb Australian summer’s day there is
never anything to carry you away.
That is the German writing ; but the
opinions, the feelings are shared by M.
Wenz. When you open Von Kotze’s
book at first, you hear appalling stories
told by the mailman who drives the new-
chum out west from Cooktown—stories
of men pinned down by fallen trees or
dying from thirst in the desert. Next
he comes to a station, all heat and dust
and mosquitoes. After a time he leaves
this station, riding out into the world
in superb weather. Nothing improves
for him. He leaves the harsh, dry in-
terior and comes to Cairns with its colos-
sal rainfall and astounding jungle coun-
try. What he sees there is simply too
much rain with exaggerated tropical
accessories ; just another kind of Aus-
tralia, the wet kind, without interest or
charm.
In quite recent years a few of our
visitors have seen Australia in another
light. D. H. Lawrence’s chapters in
“Kangaroo” where the South Coast of
New South Wales is made to come alive
are the most brilliant gift that our land-
scape has yet received from abroad: not
merely praise but interpretation. Law-
rence insisted, though, that it had not
yet been loved. He was right. It had
been feared, hated, changed, destroyed
where possible by axe and fire. Gradu-
ally we are swinging round to it, learn-
ing to wait for its own kind of beauty,
which is sometimes austere, sometimes —
as in a tiny coral island frothing with rich-
leaved trees —fabulously attractive. There
are small, rich plateaux in Southern
Queensland where every foot has been
variously farmed for decades, so that
they hang in the sky like ancient Italian
backgrounds. There is the vast “Brent
of Bin Bin” country in New South Wales.
There are the scenes of “Haxby’s Circus,”
these ranging from Cairns to Perth and
destroying for ever the legend of mono-
tony. There are the outback and some-
times dreary landscapes like Lawson’s
“Gulgong”—full of Joe Wilson and his
mates after all! The landscape of Dead
Dog is indeed beginning to be replaced
by one that is loved.
NETTIE PALMER.
Fakes
Bang! Bang!
It’s a fine day,
and I have the
traditional Eng-
lishman’s urge to
go out and kill
something. Homi-
cide being ruled out by a fastidious
judiciary, I shall chance a shot or two
elsewhere.
The air is full of fakes on the wing,
so here’s for a right and left, and blow
the keepers. False values, false reputa-
tions, are rapidly destroying our sense of
proportion, not to mention our national
self-respect.
Upheld and others have had some-
thing to say about one angle of it, but
I’m all for mixing it properly. Take
these back-to-the-cemetery movements,
for example. Instance Adam Lindsay
Gordon, now enshrined by proxy in
Westminster Abbey as this country’s
national poet. He never was. He wrote
some popular verse and a little poetry.
The poet Gordon had for pedestal the
man Gordon —showy, often superficial,
not over-courageous. But appealing to
sentiment. De mortuis and all that; I
can’t help it.
As Bertrand Russell says: “The truth
is for the gods ; truthfulness is to form
opinions on the evidence.” And the
evidence does not support the Gordon-
ites. I’ll do Gordon the justice to say I
believe he would be the first to deride
their extravagant claims for him. The
Gordon tradition is a fake. But it’s
fixed now. As a peg it’s useful for the
advertiser of self. Not admitted, of
course ; but “on the evidence.” Praise
is for the living ; the dead have run their
race, for good or ill. It’s a matter of
opinion. I’ve given mine. Give the live
dog a chance to show himself as a live
lion. And let the generous dead alone.
Don’t turn them into hoardings.
All over the place people are climbing
the ladder of faked reputation; push-
ing their way into the limelight; taking
in each other’s washing. Do they really
get satisfaction from such spurious
values? Presumably. “And departing
leave behind them footprints in the sands
of Time.” What a strange vanity! But
how dangerous. See its fruit in the
affectations of the misguided youngsters
whose first' creative efforts lead to the
adoption of spats and a cane, and a
tolerant condescension for the dinkum
old-timer. Their feet are already on the
first rung of the ladder of make-believe.
Here’s the second bird just edging out
of the covert. Captain Cook’s Cottage.
Like Gordon, it never was. It’s the
Cook Cottage—just that, and nothing
more. But no matter. So is history made.
It’s only a matter of time when we
shan’t bother any -more between B and
the bull’s foot; there won’t be any dif-
ference anyway.
Missed him! Missed them both, as a.
matter of fact. But it' wasn’t for want
of trying.
BERNARD CRONIN.
The L.S.D.
of Fiction
Writing
Sooner or later
every fiction-
writer has to de-
cide whether he
is going to please
himself or his
audience. Even genius is not immune
from that necessity, else Dickens would
not have inquired anxiously of Forster
if the “public would stand” or “take to”
this, that or the- other. Consider also
Anthony Trollope (who performed the
double miracle of writing first-rate
novels and making a great deal of money)
and how seriously he took into account
the opinions and scruples and prejudices
of his readers.
Every fiction-writer’s ideal, of course,
is to write exactly what he likes writing
and make a vast fortune by doing' so ;
and to be flatteringly reviewed and
highly thought of in literary circles.
Rarely do the high gods grant his wishes
all together—one is certain to strangle
the others. If the writer does not write
to please himself, he is flat and stale and
uninteresting. If he writes chiefly to
please himself he may have a cultured
and appreciative but limited audience.
The odds are, however, that he will have
none. If he is wise he considers the
£ s. d. of the writing game, wears the
yoke, and wears it gladly, and dedicates
his talent to pleasing the people who pay
—the reading public.
The present-day novel-reader knows
what he wants, and if he does not get
it he says “quite interesting” to your
brain-child and goes off to Gilbert
Frankau and Ethel M. Dell and Edgar
Wallace. Consider Edgar Wallace and
his sacrifice of his artistry to the demands
of the market. Twenty years ago he
was a magazine short-story writer turn-
ing out high-quality yarns with their set-
ting in West Africa —good stuff and fine
stuff, with an appeal that was almost
wholly masculine. Then he struck the
note the public demanded —which was
very close to the note he was playing,
but not the exact note —became his
readers’ bright obedient slave, and
earned a fabulous income.
The moral to the aspiring fictioneer
is that it is not enough to write well,
to have a good style and a vivid way
of expressing himself. He must hit the
high spots, and hit them often ; beat the
drum and go for bright lights and swift
movement, and not worry unduly over
the correctness or otherwise of every
word and detail. If he is too scrupu-
lously accurate, he loses color, and real-
ism is a thing quite different from literary
accuracy.
That is not to say that he is deliberately
to falsify, but to remember always that
the overseas reader is not nearly so in-
terested as he is in the details of aborigi-
nal life or in Maori pahs or Papuan
eravos; that stories of station life have
to be superlatively well done to appeal
to a reader who doesn’t know the differ-
ence between a head stockman and an
overseer (and doesn’t want to know),
and that yarns that centre about com-
mercial questions leave him very cold
indeed. He wants Love (not the nasty
kind) and Money and Murder. Poor
stuff? Then think of Shakspeare and
Scott!
If the Australian fictioneer can forget
every line that has been written about
Australia, from K. S. Prichard back to
Rolfe Boldrewood, it will help him enor-
mously.

Bridget and the

Balletomania: The Story of an Obses-

265.; per Angus and Robertson). Set-
ting out to air his enthusiasm for the
Russian ballet, the writer gets too close
to hysterics and is too personally re-
stricted to make anything like literature,
or even good reading, except for other
balletomaniacs. In his jumbled struc-
ture hides much good stuff ; chiefly anec-

the pictures, a most interesting lot.

successfully sleuthed out.

THESE ANTI-WAR AGITATORS.
Of all countries Australia is the least
likely to plunge into a war of aggression.
We have no near neighbors to fight;
there is nothing to fight about. We had
to take part in the Great War—it would
have been impossible for us to keep
out, as it was in the long run for the
Americans —but it cost us hundreds of
millions of pounds and destroyed or in-
jured the flower of our manhood. And
it left the nation with such a horror of
war that the paramount duty of self-
protection has been neglected. The
defence system has been stripped to the
bone.
Yet in this peace-loving Common-
wealth, in which everyone has the vote
and which has so nearly achieved dis-
armament, there is an annual outbreak
of anti-war congresses. One was held
in Melbourne last week. It was organ-
ised by Communists, and the machinery
and jargon of Moscow were employed.
A “presidium” was set up, and there
was a great deal of talk about “mobilis-
ing the masses” for “the fight against the
privileged classes,” “the revolutionary
struggle for power,” which is to close in
“the dictatorship of the proletariat.” The
speeches were flavored with contempt
for British and Australian institutions
and boundless admiration for Russian
ones, especially the Red Army. For
while Australia must disarm Russia may
arm to the teeth. At one point the flow
of oratory was interrupted by the dis-
covery that policemen were in the hall.
There were shouts of “Throw them out!”
Delegates to these congresses—there are
similar gatherings in other capitals—are
divided into two sections: earnest paci-
fists (professors, parsons, Quakers and
the like) and lovers of Russia and re-
volution. As a rule, they get on well
enough, earnest pacifists being gullible
creatures; but sometimes a difficulty
arises. Thus a professor “representing
the Australian Christian Students’
Movement” said at Melbourne that he
hated war in all its forms. A delegate
from “the unemployed organisations of
N. S. Wales” replied that he didn’t.
I am not opposed to all wars. I believe
in the war of the classes as the greatest
of all struggles.
The official paper of the Young Com-
munist League of Australia is even
franker.
We Communists recognise three kinds [of
war]: (1) Imperialist wars like that of
1914-18, between leading imperialist Powers
to rob each other of markets, territory, etc.,
to enslave the weaker nations and colonies
and so on. We are very definitely opposed
to such wars. (2) National revolutionary
wars for liberation. In these wars we
support the oppressed peoples to help them
win their freedom and at the same time
weaken imperialism generally. (3) Counter-
revolutionary wars of capitalist States
against socialist States (as, for example,
the Soviet Union and Soviet China). In
this case we support the socialist State to
the utmost.
Though our aim is, in the long run, to
put an end to all kinds of wars, this
cannot be done under capitalism, so first
we must end capitalism; and the only way
in which capitalism can be overthrown is
the revolutionary one.
So there are at least two sorts of car-
nage which these anti-war missionaries
approve. If a Communist army decided to
fake Australia and destroy the Constitu-
tion based on universal suffrage, their
“principles” would impel them to rally
round the Red Flag. If there should be
another Indian Mutiny, menacing the
lives of the 600,000 British and Austra-
lian women and children who live in the
Indian Empire, they would support the
natives. It is an instructive revelation.
Another Communist organ rejoices on
one page at the slaughter of Chinese
Government troops by a Red Army as-
sisted from Russia, and on another com-
mends “the struggle against war and
Fascism.”
There were two empty chairs at the
Melbourne congress. A Mr. Griffin
from Maoriland was to have sat in one
and a Herr Egon Erwin Kisch in the other;
the immigration authorities decided that
their room was preferable to their com-
pany. According to his own account,
Herr Kisch is “an author of international
renown,” though none of his books has
been translated into English. A Jew
from Prague, he claims to have
been “a victim of the Hitler terror.”
In protesting—somewhat hysterically—
against being forbidden to land, he had a
lot to say about the warlike preparations
of Europe, every word of which justifies
the advocates of a strong defence force
for Australia. If what he asserts is true,
we may need it very soon.
We don’t need Kisches, but it might
have been better if the Government had
stayed its hand so that Australians might
form their own opinion of the very
traculent-looking stranger and his mis-
sion. A certain M. Rubanoff, who was
here in 1926, set the Red cause back
years because he showed some trade-
union leaders how far apart is the
thought of this country and the U.S.S.R.
and whither some of their activities were
leading. ,
“GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.”
Premier Stevens (U.A.P.) and Deputy-
Premier Bruxner (U.C.P.) haVe concluded
what “S. M. Herald” describes as “an
arrangement for unity at the State gen-
eral election.”
It has been agreed that no sitting member
of either party who is a candidate shall
be opposed. Members of both parties will
be supported as Government members.
There are 66 “Government members”
—4l U.A.P., 23 U.C.P. and two repre-
sentatives of both—and no doubt the
“agreement” has their enthusiastic sup-
port. People insensible to the blessings
of pre-selection might consider it im-
pudent and stupid.
In 1932 seven country electorates—
Albury, Ashburnham, Dubbo, Goulburn,
Maitland, Murray and Orange—were
contested by U.A.P. and U.C.P. candi-
dates, and four others—Corowa, Casino,
Murrumbidgee and Young-—by U.C.Ps.
in friendly competition, two apiece. They
were all won for the coalition, in every
place but Casino with the defeated Min-
isterialist’s second votes; and all but
Casino and Corowa had been Labor.
It is conceivable that most of these de-
feated Ministerialists would like another
shot, with the support of the interests
they served so well; and why should
they be denied it? It is also probable, in
the case of the seven electorates men-
tioned, that supporters of the group that
had to yield the palm in 1932 consider
that they could bear it away in 1935. In
Albury, for example, with 7183 voting for
the Ministry, the U.A.P. man was only
165 ahead of the Agrarian, and the pre-
dominant partner’s advantage was by no
means great in other divisions. Refused
the right to try again (with, it may be,
some stronger representative) in a sporting
contest with an exchange of preferences,
the associated party may decide in suffi-
cient numbers to let the “Government
member” go to the devil. Losses are
certain in any event, but there will be
more than there need be if the legitimate
ambitions of parties and persons are
thwarted by the secret manoeuvres of Mr.
Stevens and Mr. Bruxner.
The same applies to city and suburban
constituencies in which the U.A.P. will
be pitted against Lang Labor. Fifteen
of these were captured when Langism
had become a stench in the nostrils, in
some instances by persons who as poli-
ticians have proved just suits of clothes
and names, and most of them will be
hard to hold. At least half a dozen will
be gifts to the other side if the U.A.P.
offers the electors no alternative choice,
capable at the worst of mustering a few
hundred votes that would be useful in the
second count, and at the best of making
a stronger appeal to unattached electors
than the sitting member. With prefer-
ential voting in force, the U.A.P. has no-
thing to fear by endorsing a plurality of
candidates and letting the electors choose
the one they want.
What has pre-selection ever done for
the U.A.P., or for the U.C.P. either?
Where did it help either party at the
Commonwealth elections?
In Calare, New England and Wim-
mera, U.C.P. members had U.A.P. oppo-
sition. In Robertson and Wannon, U.C.P.
men stood against U.A.P. members.
Both parties likewise contested Echuca
and Corangamite, from which the U.C.P.
Ms.H.R. had retired. For Ballarat and
Boothby there were two U.A.P. candi-
dates ; for Forrest, two U.C.Ps.; for
Richmond, three U.C.Ps. Not one of
these electorates was lost to Labor,
though in most there was no arrangement
for exchanging preferences. The elector-
ates that were lost to Labor were those in
which pre-selection ruled. The U.A.P.
actually made its worst showing in Tas-
mania against the solitary Labor group
that has abandoned pre-selection—and
profited thereby. Mr. Guy, the one
Minister to go down, had two Labor
opponents against him in Bass; Mr.
Hutchin, also defeated, had four against
him in Denison.
Messrs. Stevens and Bruxner, it seems,
have “agreed to recommend to their re-
spective organisations throughout the
State the need for giving the arrange-
ment whole-hearted and definite support.”
1 his has been forthcoming in many
U.A.P. districts, and the party will suffer
for it; but U.C.P. central councils have
yet to be heard from. If they haven’t
committed themselves they will do well
to ponder on the experiences of the Vic-
torian Country party since it abandoned
the “open go.”
STATE CONTROL OF
AGRICULTURE.
Probably no measure since the stormy
days when the Liberals were putting Bal-
lance’s policy into the Statute Book has
occasioned so much stir in Maoriland as
the Agriculture (Emergency Powers)
Bill. It is an outcome of the report of
the Dairy Commission, a body headed
by Justice Frazer, long president of the
Arbitration Court.
The commission found that the con-
dition of the industry constituted a
“national crisis.” It' recommended that a
Council of Production and Trade, consist-
ing of three Government-appointed mem-
bers, should be set up to co-ordinate and
“control” operations of the existing mar-
keting boards “and such other industries
as might be placed under its care.” It
recommended further that the Dairy
Produce Control Board should be dis-
solved and replaced by a new one —four
Government appointees and four elected
members —which, in addition to the
powers of the old board, should manage
the local market for butter and cheese
and fix wholesale prices.
Dairy farms, the commission said,
should be registered and licensed. A
license should be conditional on posses-
sion of approved equipment. On the
financial side, to deal with the exigencies
of an industry which used to get at least
Is. 6d. per pound for and now
thinks itself in luck if it gets 9d., it was
proposed to establish a Rural Mortgage
Corporation to take over liabilities of
farmers and reduce rates of interest
considerably.
In essence these proposals were put in
the bill (save that there are three
appointed and four elected members on
the Dairy Board), and immediately there
was a storm of protest. The Labor
party, which pins its faith to a State-
guaranteed price for butter-fat, stone-
walled the measure. William Good-
fellow, head of the Co-operative Dairy
Co., which handles at least a fourth of
the Dominion’s dairy produce, opposed
it as aiming at “complete Government
domination of industry,” and involving
the employment of “another army of
inspectors and board officials,” while
withholding the straightout subsidy
which he claims can alone save the dairy-
farmers.
An Independent member found many
to believe him when he said the
measure cloaked an attempt to foist
quotas on Maoriland farmers. Farmers’
Union President Poison, though gener-
ally approving, criticised the financial
proposals. Downie Stewart, who relin-
quished the Finance portfolio in the Ad-
ministration because he objected to rig-
ging the exchange, addressed the Asso-
ciated Chambers of Commerce on the
subject. Evidently he made out a strong
case against the bill, for the Chambers
passed a motion of protest.
All that happened was that the debate
was delayed for a week or so while a
very few minor amendments were pre-
pared, such as including the Minister of
Agriculture as a member of the Supreme
Council. The measure was then passed.
In principle, of course, it includes no-
thing that has not been long familiar in
M.L. The dairy industry has been built
up largely as the result' of such Govern-
mental “interference” as was involved in
inspection, grading, pooling of export
surplus and deduction of levies, and
those principles have been applied to
meat and other products for many years.
But in the past power has been in the
hands of elected representatives of the
industries concerned. Now a Govern-
ment-appointed Council overrides and
overrules all boards. The local market
jthis is where the toes of the Co-op

y a non-commercial authority—to-dav
m respect of dairy produce only, to-
morrow perhaps m respect of all farm
produce. And the door is open to the
similar control of “any industry.”
JURIDICAL ANOMALIES.
Judge Thomson, of N. S Wales
comradicta „f J pUSies of jus-
person Britis^Uw? con'
S™.J?iT£™ a proved ‘'"'V:
* FEW r t? y l eadier ,ud « e Curfcwis-
also of N. S. Wales-had condemned
he examination of judgment debtors as
the greatest waste of time.”
Approximately 1000 are examined each
'rfa r ln , the P Is trict Court, occupying a
udge about half a day each week, and
involving the attendance of a host of
counsel.
It is possibly something approximat-
ing to the trade-union spirit that debars
Judges from attacking the most conspicu-
ous and expensive anomaly of all—
Coroners’ Courts. Members of the public
and their lawyers are not so considerate.
Coroners began to be anachronisms
with the appearance of the first police-
man. They inquire into deaths which
are not ascribable to “natural causes.”
But in suspicious cases the police have
already inquired, and the Coroners’ in-
vestigations rarely help, and often
hamper, the police. Above all, Coro-
ners’ Courts prejudice the trials of
accused persons.
Every State in the Commonwealth is
familiar with what happens when a par-
ticularly gruesome murder occurs.
Ghouls of the press fasten on the crime,
and the Coroner’s Court is turned into
a sort of Grand Guignol. Coroners are
not governed by the rules of evidence,
and many of them are not lawyers.
Hearsay evidence, rumors, speculations,
all kinds of wild, malicious or sentimen-
tal theories which would be ruled out
at the trial, are admitted and published
with scare headlines and appropriate pic-
tures by stunt papers. Long before
the Coroner delivers his verdict the mind
of the public—the public from which the
accused person’s jury will be drawn—
has been made up one way or the other.
The verdict is almost always “guilty,”
the police having supplied the Coroner
with the information on which they
thought fit to act. Such a verdict is
in itself a far more serious “con-
tradiction of the principles of British
justice” than any wrong arising from
the Bankruptcy Act section quoted by
Judge Thomson. It means that a pos-
sibly innocent citizen is found guilty of
murder in what, in the minds of 99
people out of every 100, passes for a
court of law, and that he must bear the
stigma of having been so convicted for
the rest of his life, even if he is acquitted
later in a real court of law.
Whether or not there is a conviction in
the higher court will depend, to a great
extent, on what attitude sensational news-
papers have taken up towards the accused
during the proceedings in the Coroner’s
Court. Because anything may be said
or suggested in that jurisdiction, it has
a news value which no Criminal Court
can command. And Coroners don’t com-
mit for contempt. The stunt press may
decide that the accused is a monster, and
may feature him accordingly, in which
case his villainy will be taken for granted
in thousands of homes. Or it may see
a chance of sentimentalising the crime.
The accused will then be presented as
a Great Lover or a Victim of Fate,
Passion or what not, and have a sport-
ing chance of floating to freedom on a
wave of worked-up emotionalism.
Taking them by and large, Coroners’
Courts do more, directly and indirectly,
to bring our judicial system into con-
tempt than any other feature of it. They
cost a lot of money, part of which might
be usefully applied to the raising of our
underpaid Judges’ salaries. And they are
superfluous. Any fairly senior police-
man could be trusted to grant burial
certificates in the countless accident cases
where doctors can’t certify because the
causes of death, though obviously free
from a suspicion of criminality, are not
natural. Government and other ex-
perts already do the finding, to all intents
and purposes, in fires, mining accidents
and other catastrophes calling for pro-
fessional knowledge. The police, as
traffic authorities, have the last word in
important motoring cases. The Coroner,
m short, has degenerated into the equiva-
lent of a very junior subaltern who

INNER TEMPLE.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Another Dragon Down.
While the official inquiry into the loss
of the Miss Hobart was dragging along,
a ’plane of the same type dived to earth
near Longreach (Q.) with its four occu-
pants, who were all killed. The Royal
Aeronautical Society has asked for a
thorough technical investigation by men
qualified to overhaul machines and
materials.
The first Dragon to come to Australia
was flown in Sydney by Major de Havil-
land last year. With two engines and
10-passenger capacity, it seemed safe and
stable. It was repeatedly demonstrated
that it could maintain height on one
engine. The makers were among the
most famous in the world —they built the
Comet that was to win the air race. One
of the Dragons flew in that race under
nomination from the M.L. Centenary Air
Race Committee; it has now got safely
to Maoriland. Altogether there are 60
in use.
Two British air lines —Imperial Air-
ways and Hillman Airways—adopted
the Dragons, Hillman for cross-Channel
flights. One was put on * the Mel-
bourne-Launceston run; another was
bought for a new service in the North-
ern Territory. A type with four engines
—the D.H. 86’s —was designed for Singa-
pore-Australia ; it was larger and more
luxurious, and had four engines develop-
ing about 600 h.p., instead of two de-
veloping 260 h.p., in the original model.
These four-engined jobs were de-
scribed by Qantas as “having a very
high reliability, owing to performance
being still possible if one, or even two,
engines fail” ; in fact, “the most modern
four-engined machine of moderate size
in the world, with a safety factor for
overseas crossings far superior to any
single-, twin-, or triple-engined type.”
The first of them in use, the Miss
Hobart, began its regular service from
Melbourne to Launceston on October 1.
Nineteen days later it disappeared com-
pletely with a full complement of pas- -
sengers.
Two mure of the type were brought
to Australia —one flown from England
by Captain Brain ; the second flown by
Captain Prendergast, one of the most
trusted pilots of Imperial Airways, with
a skilled staff. This crashed before it
reached its destination, so that two out
of three of the machines almost imme-
diately came to grief upon being put
into use. None of the descriptions of
the Longreach accident by eyewitnesses
indicates a cause. The machine appar-
ently hit the ground at 160 miles an hour.
The two-engined machines had their
first bad accident early in October. A
Rapide model —the Hillman machine —
came to grief over the English Channel
in such a crash that, “judging by the
remains picked up, it was impossible for
the rescuers to say whether there’had
been five or seven passengers on board.”
It was suggested that the pilot might have
misjudged his height and hit the sea at
150 miles an hour, but this was guess-
work. It was Hillman’s first crash. A
month afterwards the Northern Territory
mail Dragon failed to rise through an
engine cutting out, and came to grief,
fortunately without tragedy, though one
of the passengers was killed afterwards
in another machine.
Inside six months 22 persons have been
killed in three Dragon-type liners, 15 in
Australia. In every case the man may
have been at fault rather than the
machine; in any c*ise the Australian
public will be satisfied with nothing less
than the investigation demanded by the
Royal Aeronautical Society.

The Political Touch.
“Old-timer” : The professional world
of N. S. Wales wishes the Stevens Gov-
ernment well on the whole, but its
blunders are disheartening. It seems to
have no men for the parts which wise
old birds like MacLaurin and Mackellar
filled so usefully for previous anti-Sosh
Administrations. This may be why we
find Dr. Colvin, M.L.C., appointed
physician to the Duke.
Dr. Colvin is a competent country
practitioner, but his eminence is political
rather than professional. He is not an
M.D. There should be no politics in
the matter of looking after the Prince,
and the Government, I submit, should
have considered one of the following:

A committee has been appointed to
cope with the so-called shark menace on
beaches. There is no biologist on it. Yet
Sydney possesses two marine biologists
with international reputations—Professor
Dakin and the ichthyologist at the
Museum. The exclusion of such men
is bad in principle, and it isn’t even good
parly tactics in the long run.

Efficiency on the Farm.
An illuminating fact broadcast through
Dalgety’s report concerns the supreme
efficiency which Australia reveals in the
production of wool.
Since 1876 the average fleece of this
country’s sheep has doubled in weight.
That is to say, the sheep of 1934, which
eats no more grass than its ancestor of
60 years ago, is exactly twice as produc-
tive. Even in recent years the improve-
ment of yield has been almost incredible.
In 1901 there were 83,000,000 sheep, and
they produced 1,300,000 bales of wool.
Last year the number had increased to
only 111,000,000 sheep, but from these
were shorn 3,000,000 bales.
Dalgety’s researches might have gone
back further to the days when the origi-
nal Macarthur animal —that long-legged
brute, more like a goat than a sheep—
was regarded as a wonder when it re-
turned 31b. of wool. Probably the soil
and the grasses of this country have
something to do with the astounding
wool-production, but the greater part of
it is undoubtedly due to the scientific
study and experimentation of experts,
few of whom have received any recog-
nition. In wool-production and wool-
handling Australia leads the world.
In other land industries this is not the
case. An authority on wheat-production
has given it as his considered opinion that
the Australian harvest could be doubled,
without adding one acre to the area
under cultivation, were the industry
studied with the same intelligence and
perseverance which have been accorded to
wool-production. Similar announcements
have been made by men of equal note
in their particular fields regarding the
production of butter and meat. The
wheat farm on which the same land is
scratched year after year is paralleled by
the dairy farm filled with cows which
don’t give sufficient butter-fat to pay
for the grass they consume, by cattle-
runs where the scrubs outnumber the
negotiable stock.
Farm-relief plans are fermenting in the
minds of Australian politicians. Short
of establishing the principle that the man
who has made a bad bargain has a right
to expect the Government to get him
out of it, everything possible should be
done for the deserving, but nothing for
the shiftless, the incompetent and the
hopeless. They are better out of the
business.

The Moneylender.
Moved by the case of a Sydney relief
worker’s wife who, according to
Solomon, M.L.A., was charged £3O in-
terest on a loan of £22 for 18 months,
the Stevens Government volunteered to
introduce a bill “to prevent the practice
of usury.” It now finds there are “diffi-
culties” in the way.
The obvious requirements of an effec-
tive Moneylenders’ Act are provision for,
(1) Registration. (All moneylenders to
be licensed, and certificates to be granted
only to fit characters.)
(2) Limitation of interest.
(3) Abolition of the practice of charging
fees to would-be borrowers irrespective of
whether or not money is advanced.
(4) Prohibition of the sending of cir-
culars and the use of aliases.
The foregoing are to be found in Lord
Darling’s celebrated Act of 1927, which
in less than a year reduced the number
of registered moneylenders in Britain
from 30,000 to 6000.
The N. S. Wales Government’s “diffi-
culties” are political rather than legal;
tactical rather than technical. Money-
lenders are by no means the detested
harpies they are in some quarters repre-
sented as being. They fulfil a social need,
so much so that the moneylender has a
far better chance of getting his interest
nowadays than the landlord has of get-
ting his rent —and their services were
never so much in demand as in the
present hard times. The tens of thousands
who live, literally, from hand to mouth
find the moneylender a far surer rock
of refuge than Mr. Colvin’s lottery, and
they would be as reluctant to see the
one abolished as the other. In brief,
there is a moneylenders’ vote, and no
party can afford to alienate it.

The Odd Case of Henare Hona.
“Taniwha”: Maoris are a law-abiding
race. Beyond such peccadilloes as
driving a motor-car when pickled they
don’t, as a rule, cause the police much
trouble. An exception cropped up re-
cently—a youth named Henare Hona.
He was wanted for the murder of a
farmer, his wife and their two sons.
Two policemen tried to arrest him;
he shot both, killing one, and then com-
mitted suicide. There appeared no
motive for the initial crimes.
Those who know the native mind put
it down as a case of whaka-momori,
which means, translating very freely,
working off a grudge by involving one’s
enemies in one’s own disgrace.
Hona, a Nga-puhi, loved a girl of the
Ngati-maniapoto. There was some
bickering between these tribes at the
time, and Hona was told by the girl’s
relatives that he wasn’t an acceptable
suitor. He was furiously indignant, not
only against the Ngati-maniapoto, but
against his own tribe for involving him
in their quarrel. He therefore (so it is
concluded after study of various letters
he wrote) decided to exact utu (repay-
ment) for his wrongs by involving his
race in odium. There are many instances
of this sort of thing in Maori history.
Before the whites came such acts were
aimed at precipitating tribal warfare, and,
as the Maori regarded war as the sport,
were not considered socially disreputable.
«
Learning Instead of Loafing.
The British suggestion that unemployed
boys and girls should be returned to
their schools for additional grounding
might well be considered by the Gov-
ernments of Australian States.
Every city and most of the country
towns have troops of youngsters who
have left school because they have
reached the leaving age or because they
have won their leaving certificates. There
is no work for them; the edge is being
rubbed off their accomplishments; their
education is beginning to rust, and, by
the time they have the opportunity of
utilising it, it will have dulled to com-
parative uselessness. They will have to
“come back” —a feat as difficult for a
scholar as for an athlete.
The leaving age is lamentably low as
it' is. Youngsters are permitted to go
out into the world with much less ac-
quired knowledge than is necessary for
their future, and for the future of Aus-
tralia.
Under normal conditions it would
possibly be hard on many people to
prevent their children from contributing
to the family income after 14; but
normal conditions do not apply to-day.
Youngsters who can get work will con-
tinue working ; those who cannot will be
able to continue their education and lose
nothing but the likelihood of drifting
into vicious habits in many cases, and in
a few into criminal ones.

Trusting in Providence.
The grasshopper arrived with the spring.
Reports from western N. S. Wales and
Queensland said he was breeding in mil-
lions. People who knew him in Asia and
Africa and had seen him strip a coun-
tryside as clean of greenery as a head
waiter’s shirt-front pointed out that he
might be a worse calamity than a big
drought' or a fall in the price of wool.
The politicians said “Oh, yes?” and
turned eagerly to the congenial job of
telling electors that “Australia was well
on the way to recovery through our
efforts.” Farmers and local authorities,
advised that the time to kill the locust
was when he was young, said in effect:
“Well, let’s wait and see if Jehovah will
smite him first!”
Now the hungry insect is advancing
towards the coast in a line which reaches
from west of the Darling Downs to Eyre
Peninsula. In Victoria it’ has dawned
on Allnutt, M.L.A., that despite the
“liberal and prompt” efforts of the Gov-
ernment —three months after they should
have been begun —there are only 200
men employed on the extermination of a
60-mile-long swarm which is threatening
the Mildura country. Mr. Allnutt thinks
that 8000 of the 10,000 people in the dis-
trict should be on the job. But in Mel-
bourne, where there are as yet' no grass-
hoppers, the Minister for Agriculture is
still “deprecating alarmist reports.”
The position is not as serious as it has
been made out. In some areas between 60
and 70 grasshoppers to the square foot
have been killed There is no occasion
for alarm.
The basis of the Minister’s complac-
ence appears to be that the pests have not
yet attacked crops or vines—merely
pasture. So he is going to be cheerful
until they finish the grass and start on
the wheat.
In South Australia they have done
that already. When they had a foothold
on 2000 holdings of 750,000 acres and
had destroyed 150,000 acres of crops and
400,000 acres of pasture, the Minister
for Agriculture introduced a Noxious
Insects Bill to compel local-governing
bodies and landowners to take “prompt
measures.” Prompt!
In N. S. Wales, despite Government
action —the Dubbo P.P. Board alone has
90 tons of poison bait —landowners
“have stopped the eradication campaign,
believing that it is hopeless to cope with
the invasion.” The populations of Con-
dobolin and other towns are mobilised
amid a ruin of stripped gardens, and the
insects—undiscouraged by Mr. Lang’s
protest in Parliament against being “kept
here dealing with grasshoppers and other
little tiddlywinking matters” —patter on
roofs and window-panes like rain.
In Queensland at Inglewood the
hordes obscured the sun ; at other places
paddocks are being eaten out, and the
swarms are making steady progress east-
ward with endless reserves behind them.
Presently, somebody will rise in Par-
liament and propose financial relief for
farmers who earlier “refused to co-
operate” with those who saw the danger,
and the overburdened community will
be taxed a little further. There will be
no political scapegoats for the costly
delay—there never are.

This Kisch Business.
Columns of newsprint have recorded the
doings and sayings of Egon Erwin Kisch
and the opinions of his sympathisers and
denouncers. No one thought to get the
impressions of the master of the Strath-
aird, who must be the most mystified
mariner in the Seven Seas ; but “Findy”
claims to have obtained them by his own
peculiar process of divination:
Until we reached Fremantle I really didn’t
know Kisch was on board. Then a Customs
official told me he was a prohibited immigrant,
so to save the £lOO penalty I kept him on the
ship. When we reached Melbourne a lady,
who apparently had never seen Kisch befqre,
applied for a writ of habeas corpus against
me. I was rather hoping she’d get it, but the
Victorian Chief Justice, who, I am told, was
once Federal Attorney-General, agreed with
the Customs officer. Verdict for the Common-
wealth; costs against Kisch.
I kept Mr. Kisch on board. At least I told
him to stay on board. He didn’t seem to like
the idea, so he made a pier-head jump on his
own plan. It was foolish of him; he wouldn’t
have sprained his ankle if he’d stayed on
board.
The Victorian police brought him back. I
didn’t want him much. _ I don’t like unappreci-
ative passengers, and it quite spoilt the trip
to Sydney.
When we reached Sydney someone else
applied for a habeas-corpus writ. A young High
Court Justice heard the case. Verdict for
Kisch; costs against the Commonwealth.
Next thing I heard was that the Customs
people had Kisch again and were giving him a
dictation test. He failed in Gaelic and I
don’t blame him. I don’t believe they could
have passed it themselves.
Well, I’m off on a cruise to New Zealand
now (or Maoriland, I think you call it) and I
am mortally afraid he’ll be waiting for me
when I get back. Someone is sure to overrule
someone else’s judgment. And a man who
can speak 11 languages (even without Gaelic)
is a nuisance on any ship.
My opinion? I haven’t any. Who is Kisch,
anyhow?

Bridging the Continent.
From Crawford Vaughan:
Hitherto the carrying out of the 1911 agree-
ment between South Australia and the Com-
monwealth, by virtue of which the national
authority undertook to complete the North-
South railway in return for the transfer to it
of the Northern Territory, has been regarded as
being mainly the concern of the Central State.
It is at last dawning upon the N.S.W. autho-
rities that their costly railway to Broken Hill,
which is doomed to extinction when the Barrier
mines are exhausted, might be made an in-
tegral part of transcontinental railway systems
stretching in a comparatively direct line from
east to west and north to south. Mr. Stevens
is to bring the matter up at the next Premiers’
conference.
All that is required to give effective rail
connection between Sydney and both Fremantle
and Alice Springs is an inexpensive transfer
station at Broken Hill. This simple device
would save nearly a day each way in the
carriage of mails to and from Fremantle, and
a night’s sleep for passengers. With the
bridging of the gap between Alice Springs and
Birdum, travellers from Sydney to Darwin, Java
and China would save nearly a week, both on
outward and homeward journeys. This con-
clusion is based on the assumption that the
North-South timetables would be speeded up
to correspond with East-West.
The Sydney-Darwin route via Bourke and
Camooweal may be ruled out of consideration.
It would demand the construction of 1483
miles of new railway, involving many bridges
over flooded areas, as compared with less than
600 miles between Alice Springs and Birdum
with no serious engineering difficulties involved.
The Bourke-Birdum route would save only
315 miles of travel compared with the Broken
Hill-Birdum line; and it would cost £10,000,000
as against less than £3,000,000.
Commonwealth railway officials, with some
support from S. Aus. interests, would fling
another million of borrowed money into the
bottomless pit by extending the Red Hill
railway to Port Augusta. This million if
spent on partially honoring the unredeemed
pledge to the Verran Government, in which I
was Treasurer, by pushing the terminus of Tie
great northern railway as far north as Ten-
nant’s Creek, would serve a promising gold-
field The Red Hill extension would serve no
industry.
If the capital cost of the East-West line
were increased by another £1,000,000, it would
involve the Australian community in an
annual loss of £90,000. The S.A. Railways
Standing Committee so reported in 1913, and
the Goodman Commission in 1931.
Said the Goodman Commission, presided over
by one of Australia’s leading engineers: "‘The
Red Hill-Port Augusta project would not result
in opening up any new territory or in increasing
production. It would be almost entirely a line
of convenience for the East-West passenger
t ra ffic This expenditure of borrowed
money is absolutely unjustified, and would
result in permanently adding to the financial
difficulties of the Commonwealth and of the
State.”

"AND IT'S POINTED WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Marcelle”: When the prize-
winning airmen were leaving
Melbourne by the express for
Sydney Campbell Black was
commissioned to buy chocolate
for the party, which consisted
of Scott, Turner, Pangborn
and himself. Macpherson
Robertson was seeing them off,
and a roar of laughter went up
when Black was found to have
returned with chocolate pro-
duced by a rival firm. With a
muttered apology to the prompter of the
air race, he rushed back to the kiosk and
exchanged it for an article bearing the
trade-mark which is on the air-race
medal.
* * * *
“Oran”: Roscoe Turner, who won
the hearts of the police force at Charle-
ville by calling the first-in-command
“Colonel,” the second “Buddy” and the
remainder “Boys,” worked on the plan
of a Melbourne businessman whose pro-
fession brings him in constant touch with
the Law. “You seem to get on awfully
well with the police,” grumbled a rival
one day. “They don’t help me nearly
as much. How do you manage it?”
“Easily,” said the other. “I call ’em all
‘Officer.’ ”
* * * *
“C.A.M.”: I was always taught to
believe that the oldest standing building
in Australia is the Elizabeth Farm House
at Parramatta erected in 1793 by John
Macarthur. I now read of a chemical
laboratory at Rose Hill, in the same
district, which is claimed to date from
1791. There is a reference to it in
Captain John Hunter’s “Historical Jour-
nal of the Transactions at Port Jackson
and Norfolk Island” (London, 1793),
where it is recorded that “the barrack
at Rose Hill was nearly ready to receive
the men [of the N.S.W. Corps], and one
wing of the officers’ barracks was ready
for tiling.” If this “wing” is the present-
day laboratory it is almost certainly the
oldest house in the Commonwealth.
>S H= * *
“Quat’ Bras”: The proposal to station
an Australian Guards regiment in
London is said by a Fleet-street cabler
to have been
Endorsed in Army circles, on the ground
that it would emphasise Imperial unity
and tend to strengthen Dominion loyalty
to the Crown.
Actually it would inspire more inter-
Imperial hatred, malice, jealousy and
contempt than a hundred Test matches.
The Brigade of Guards is a wonderful
fighting machine, with traditions of over-
seas service that date from 1680 (Tan-
gier). But it is essentially a social insti-
tution. The youngest subaltern must
begin with a private income of at least
£5OO p.a.; and most of them have far
more. The Guardee in embryo is formed
by a few expensive public schools (Eton
chiefly) according to a pattern. His
clothes, voice, bearing, social habits and
prejudices are as individual as his brigade
tie, and the unqualified adapter of any
of them is regarded with loathing by
normal Britons. A Guards officer with
an Aussie accent, a Guards N.C.O. or
ranker with the free and easy ways of
a Digger would be contradictions in
terms to England, and the better they
proved as fighting soldiers the more they
would be detested as Guardsmen. Dump
an Australian regiment in London by all
means, if money must be wasted ; but
don’t, for the love of harmony, call it a
Guards regiment!

“Runa”: Characteristic odors, is it?
Let me nominate Rotorua (M.L.) as the
possessor of possibly the most startling.
The tourist usually arrives about night-
fall, and after dinner makes a pilgrimage
to the recreation grounds. He has
already noticed a peculiar and all-per-
vading smell that suggests a neglect of
sanitation, but in the vicinity of the
Malfroy Geyser the effect is such that
“I see they’ve cancelled the ball at Guver’mint ’Ouse to-night."
“Aw, well, we’ll ’ave to see if we can rake up a four f’r bridge."
he produces his hanky and rails at the
state of the drains. Residents hurriedly
explain that the odor is entirely due to
volcanic activity, sulphurised mud and
highly-mineralised water combining.
It is not only harmless ; it is wonder-
fully beneficial in chest affections, and
people with chronic coughs lose them
entirely during a sojourn among the sul-
phur and the steam.
“Erua”: To cities with distinctive
aromas add Wellington, M.L.’s capital.
The smell here is not Wellington’s own,
but comes from the Chinese quarter,
and not even the Wellington wind can
disperse it. On any evening it can be
clearly detected on the hills above the
city, “them spicy garlic smells” over-
powering even the strong musky odor
of M.L.’s bush. I heard a sea captain
declare once that through a dense fog
he knew he was approaching Cook Strait.
He smelt Wellington.
♦ * * *
“Chlorine”: The use of poisonous
gases and fumes in warfare is no new
thing; it is only modern chemical re-
search that has made this form of attack
so deadly and horrible. Nevertheless,
most people will be surprised to learn,
on the authority of Professor Hicks, of
Adelaide, that the Spartans had some
glimmering of what might be done
with clouds of noxious smoke. At the
siege of Platsa (429 b.c.) immense pots
of pitch and sulphur were ignited under
the walls, to the intense discomfort of
the beleaguered citizens. Nearly 1900
years later there is mention of burning
faggots steeped in sulphur being hurled
by the defenders of Belgrade on the
attacking Turks. But even in those days
there seems to have been an uneasy
idea that this sort of thing was not
altogether fair fighting. There is a de-
lightful touch in the quoted opinion of
an Elizabethan writer that Christians
should not use such terrible methods of
warfare against Christians, but “they may
be used against Turks and other unbe-
lievers.”
* * * *
“Crash”: An electrical engineer of
Wairarapa (M.L.) had to deal with a
mysterious short-circuit on a power line
that recurred on three successive morn-
ings at about four o’clock. A thorough
search of the transmission line failed to
reveal any dead bird. On the fourth
morning all available men were posted to
watch the section. One of these nailed
the culprits. About dawn he saw two
ducks fly up from a dam on to the
cross-arm of a pole and fall dead to the
ground. Two sheep-dogs that had evi-
dently been waiting picked up the birds
and trotted off. Subsequently their
owner admitted that jie had wondered
why the dogs seemed to have “gone off
their tucker.”
* * * *
“The Grenadiers”: Sydney takes a
long time to assimilate the idea of
silent homage to the dead. It is years
since it saw such a show as the Grena-
dier Guards gave it, but the crowd per-
sisted in showing its enthusiasm at the
wrong time and place. One might have
expected something in the nature of
silence when the band turned from
Castlereagh-street into Martin-place and
began the slow march to the Cenotaph.
Instead, however, there were cheers ;
more cheers when an opening bar was
taken as presaging “Australia Will Be
There” (which it didn’t); and still more
cheers for “Roses of Picardy.” The
Director of Music waved his baton de-
precatingly, but in vain. It was only
when he signalled to the crowd to join in
the singing of the hymnified version of
the 90th Psalm that they realised their
mistake.

“Catchpenny”: There is nothing sur-
prising in far fewer women being struck
by lightning than men (B. 7/11/ ’34). The
six or seven cases I can recall in my own
district have all been stockmen. Their
work takes them out where lightning
strikes most freely (in ironstone country)
and at the time when it is most likely to
strike, namely, in the heat of the day.
During thunderstorms it is well to keep
as far away from wire fences as possible
and also to give rotten trees a wide berth.
Sheep and horses and, occasionally, cows
are caught as they rest against the wires.
I have seen 20 sheep stretched dead and
as many more stunned while making a
midday camp along the boundary fence.
* * * *
“Nym”: The landlord of the lakeside
hotel waved me into the parlor. “Hey,
Andy,” he said to the youth who sat at
the table drawing, “take this gent.’s lug-
gage up to Number Five. And for the
love o’ Mike get yer drawin’ gear out o’
this!” The young man, absorbed in his
work, did not move until a second ad-
monition caused him to reluctantly gather
together his materials. “He’s cracked on
drawing airyplanes,” explained Bung
later in an indulgent tone. “He’s gettin’
as bad as that writer bloke we had here
last summer. A character he was! Polite
sort o’ cove, but that absent-minded!
Seen him walkin’ along near the water
one day readin’ a book o’ poitry when
he trips over our old cow that was lyin’
acrost the path. ‘Oh, I beg your pardon,’
he sings out. He was a bit flustered when
he seen his mistake, but he gets his nose
into his book again right away. A
minute later he bumps into old Mother
Moggs as he was turnin’ the corner of
the boatshed, and he says, fair snappy:
‘Out o’ me way, you cow!’ ”
* * * *
“Second Divvy”: John Monash’s
letters to his wife have me puzzled. I
left late in 1915 when the Emden had
been sunk, and it was as safe, militarily,
to send news across the Indian Ocean as
across the Tasman Sea. Yet my letters
to Australia, written after leaving
Colombo and containing such informa-
tion as that we had “300 horses” and “ex-
pected to go to a place called Zeitoun,”
were so disfigured by the censor that I
kept a couple as curiosities and threw
the others over the side. Many months
earlier, it seems, Monash wrote from
Heliopolis:
Everything points to a direct move to
the place where we shall be most wanted,
and appearances indicate that that place
will not be very far away. Try and figure
that out.
And he wrote from Anzac:
My brigade has had over 2300 casual-
ties.
Again, after a reference to “our very
heavy losses (a total of over half the
brigade)”:
Most of the fine South Australian officers
who met at my sports at Broadmeadows
have been killed.
If one of the other ranks had been
caught sending away information half so
potentially valuable to the enemy he
would have been court-martialled.
“M.G.”: At the Shrine dedn
cation in Melbourne a histori-
cal sketch of the two minutes’
silence was given, but no
word of tribute was paid
to the memory of the
man responsible for the idea.
This was E. Honey, sometime
a reporter on Melbourne
“Argus.” Honey was in Lon-
don when the war ended, and sug-
gested in one of the dailies that the
silence should be observed on each anni-
versary. The idea caught on, and when
the King gave it his support it was
adopted throughout the Empire. Honey,
who belonged to a well-known Mel-
bourne family, died a year or two later.

“10-2-4”: At last we have something
definite from Spiritland. According to
a Sydney “Sun” article:
Natacha Rambova, the beautiful second
wife of the late Rudolph Valentino, has
received spirit messages from him through
a medium. “The messages I have received
from Rudy,” she once said, “are wonder-
ful He tells me that he is extremely
happy.”
Miss Rambova also claimed that Valen-
tino had explained his will in which he
left her only one dollar. “I quite under-
stand,” she said.
Any gin-doped old adventuress postur-
ing as a medium can get alleged spirit
messages through in which deceased
claims vaguely to be “happy” (“Oh, so
happy!” is the customary phrase). But
here we get a communication which ex-
plains to the satisfaction of a lovely
widow why the departed owner of
£lOO,OOO cut her off with the equivalent
of 4s. Here, plainly, is supernaturalism.
No human agency could have done it.

“Lex”: Judgment was given against
a Sydney motorist last week in familiar
circumstances: Plaintiff started to cross
Pitt-street, the traffic constable’s signal
being against vehicles at the time; de-
fendant came later and hit plaintiff. De-
fendant was in the wrong because he
obeyed the t.c. Yet, if he hadn’t, he
would have been waved at furiously;
perhaps have been booked for obstruct-
ing the traffic. What it means is that
Sydney hasn’t so much as begun to solve
its jay-walking problem. Even in the
heart of the city, where cops abound,
pedestrians literally walk into cars, a
result being that the motorist who isn’t
level-headed and quick-sighted enough to
watch the t.c., both sidewalks and the
roadway at the same time, and ignore
the t.c. where necessary, is liable to find
him- or herself indicted for manslaughter
or cast in heavy damages. This perilous
state of affairs is going to persist till
some means is discovered of getting
every member of the public off the road
at intersections before vehicular traffic is
given orders to charge. London does it:
why can’t Sydney?
GIN AND BITTERS.
“Mr. Edgar, the Victorian M.L.C., announced that
he tiad returned the latest telephone directory to the
P.M.G. because it contained an advertisement setting
forth the merits of a certain brand of gin.”
Another sturdily determined starter
In the fierce race for righteous fame enrol,
For conscience sake as palpably a martyr
As any upon Fox’s deathless scroll!
My oath! They’ve struck a snag, they’ve caught
a Tartar,
It’s pretty clear, in this heroic soul
Who finds his loftiest inspiration in
Implacable hostility to gin.
Some reckon rum a more insidious mocker;
They’re down on beer and whisky, other
chaps.
But he’d as soon have lysol in his locker
As any snakejuice from the vintners’ taps,
And nothing really agitates his rocker
As violently as a sniff of schnapps.
Old Nick, we’re most of us agreed, ’s a curse,
But Edgar ranks Old Tom a trifle worse.
His is the faith, sustaining and upraising,
The stand for principle they reckoned meet,
That sent stout Cranmer to the faggots blazing
And pertinacious Pickwick to The Fleet.
His stoic hardihood’s no less amazing
Than theirs; when conscience calls he won’t
be beat.
And back to the benighted P.M.G.
There goes a telephone directory.
Forbear to ask what he will do without it
And get his calls put through, for none can
tell.
But honest deprivation—devil doubt it!
Like this is just the stuff to ring the bell.
He’s penalised himself, that’s all about it,
For principle, for sacred principle!
And better, surely, hardship than the sin
Of countenancing ads. regarding gin.

“Amity”: Touching these unclaimed
bank balances (B. 14/11 / ’34), I know
why one stays where it is. Twenty years
ago an engaged couple started a joint
account in the lady’s name, with a view
to equipping their future home. One
day the boy friend got an advance
of a tenner. It was not till his
co-depositor discovered that he had
fallen under the spell of a rival
charmer and bought her a wristlet watch
for a birthday gift that the trouble began.
After some hard words the lady pro-
duced the bank book and hurled it into
the fire, which ended the engagement.
She did not apply for another book, and
the youth made no demand for his share
of the nest-egg, £4O or thereabouts. Both
parties are now married, and when one
prosperous matron chances on the
annual remarks on unclaimed accounts
she merely smiles reminiscently.

“Lordelpus”: Ginger Meggs, Skeeter,
Fatty Finn and the Aria Kids are all
right in their places — i.e., in the hands of
the very young. So are “comics” featur-
ing fantastic adventure strips in which
children figure. But what justification
is there for stuff, aimed palpably
at grown-ups, like “The Adventures
of ‘Speed’ Gordon”? It is as infan-
tile as anything that has appeared
in a kid’s paper; the only differences
are that the hero is an adult and that
there is a semi-naked female resembling
a film star to supply the love interest.
“Wotcher pinched for, Robbo?”
“Dealin’ it out to a cop.”
Every intelligent student of the flapper
press has long been aware that there are
tens of thousands of grown-ups who
suffer from arrested development. The
appearance of “Speed” Gordon helps one
to fix the mental age of this section..
It is indeed a solemn thought that count-
less brawny athletes, lovely business girls,
hard-working fathers of families and
devoted mothers in this fair land of ours
are —except as regards physique no
more than eight years of age.

“D.”: An ornate programme (“from
the press of the ‘Hollywood Reporter’ ”)
which was supplied at the preview of
“The House of Rothschild” witnesses
to the muddled state of the American
mind regarding British titles. In the
film Nathan is made a baron. Accord-
ing to the synopsis:
England, now duly grateful to Nathan
Rothschild, at a great ceremony, creates
him a baronet.
And a photograph overleaf which
shows Nathan kissing the Prince Regent’s
hand has the caption “Knighted!”
Apropos, one of Hearst’s papers assumed
recently that a Lord Mayor was ipso
facto a peer.

“Uskub”: A widely-published state-
ment credits the murdered King Alex-
ander of Yugoslavia with having been
the richest monarch in Europe, his real
and personal estate being valued at six
millions. It is scarcely credible, but if
true the Karageorgevitch clan
returned to something more
than a rather insecure throne
when the last Obrenovitch and
his wife were murdered at
Belgrade and their naked bodies
flung into the palace courtyard
in 1903. The late King Alex-
ander’s father (Peter) spent the
greater part of his life as a pre-
tender and an exile, and a
notoriously hard-up one at that.
And when King Milan, the last
but one of the Obrenovitches,
was forced to abdicate in favor
of his ill-fated son, he devoted
most of his time to punting for
modest sums on Paris race-
courses and at rouge-et-noir
tables. The Serbian royal revenues never
amounted to much in those days ; if the
last King found methods of becoming a
millionaire several times over as a side-
line from his regular job it is likely to
have deepened his unpopularity.

“Sooby”: J. M. Fowler, ex-M.H.R.,
and the late Harry Daglish, Westralia’s
first Labor Premier, were not the only
politicians who started their careers in
Subiaco debating societies (B. 7/11/’34).
Senator George Pearce, who has sat in
more Federal Ministries than any other
man, first got his foot on the ladder of
public life in the same salubrious suburb.
This bit of ancient history is attested by
a tablet outside the local guildhall which
preserves George’s name as one of the
foundation councillors ; he squeaked in
last in a field of six. That was in 1899.
When Daglish threw up the Labor leader-
ship, preparatory to drifting over to the
other side, Pearce was invited to abandon
Federal politics and return to fill the
vacant place. He refused, sagaciously
enough from his own point of view,
though he could hardly have foreseen
in 1905 what the years had in store for
him at Melbourne and Canberra.

“Marsay”: The generally-accepted be-
lief that France is a sober country be-
cause it is largely a wine-drinking one
was assailed at the W.C.T.U. congress in
Melbourne, where a speaker gave statis-
"Eh, mum, why don’t y’ arsk Santa C[?]us to bring the new baby and save
the doctor’s bill?”
tics of deaths from alcoholism: England,
11 per 1000; Germany, 13 per 1000;
France, 17 per 1000. All the same, it is
a rarity to see a drunken person in
France, though it is wrong to suppose
that Frenchmen drink nothing but wine.
Like the Englishman and the German,
the average Gaul has a pot of beer in
preference to a glass of wine. The large
death-rate is probably due, not to wine-
bibbing, but to addiction to the absinthe
glass.

“Findy”: lam not competent to state
whether the air-mail ’planes should do
the trip in 17 days or 17 hours (my
grandfather was 17 weeks coming out
from Glasgow and thought he’d done
pretty well), but a short flight in the
Diana convinced me that passengers
will do the trip in comfort. On the
ground, with her four engines and large
wing-span, the machine gives a reassur-
ing sense of safeness which is, if any-
thing, intensified when she goes aloft.
The cabin is roomy and well ventilated,
and the seats, if installed on our long-
distance railways, would make train
travelling a deal more pleasant. The
noise nuisance, too, has been largely
eliminated, and conversation can be
carried on quite easily without unduly rais-
ing the voice. The impression of safeness
and comfort which i received was not
affected in the least by the deplorable
accident to the sister-ship two days later.

“Adelaide”: A South Aus. Court has
been puzzling over the case of a husband
against whom the wife had a mainten-
ance order. Charged with “wilful and
habitual failure to pay,” he proved that
for months he had gone to her home as
a boarder at £1 a week. The Court
decided that this could hardly be con-
strued as compliance with the order, but
at the same time it ruled that the omis-
sion to pay maintenance during this
period was with the wife’s consent.
* * * *■
“Scribe”: A recent reference to the
Dandenong (Vic.) murder of 30-odd years
ago has a particular interest for me be-
cause I reported the trial of the two
accused. The case was remarkable for
the evidence of a French Mauritian
with colored blood in him. He described
how one Saturday afternoon he was
walking along Flinders-street when
Tisler, the male accused, accosted him
with the query: “Would you be willing
to bump off a bloke for a hundred
pounds?” The witness deposed that he
indicated his willingness to do business
on those lines and that Tisler (a com-
plete stranger to him previously) pro-
ceeded to fill in the details. The money
was being put up by a lady, and the pro-
spective victim was the lady’s husband.
Tisler was himself the boy friend. His
idea was that they would take the train
to Oakleigh, walking across country to
avert suspicion, and they would find
“the bloke” ploughing his orchard. The
witness went on to describe how this part
of the scheme was carried out according
to plan and that, when they had located
the man, Tisler handed the witness i
loaded revolver and said, “That’s him:
now bump him off.” “But you didn’t
do it?” said the Crown Prosecutor.
“Why didn’t you carry out your part of
the bargain?” The witness drew himself
up proudly, as one who felt that his
honor was being impugned. “Because,”
he retorted, “I was frightened they might
slip me up for the money.”

“D.8.K.”: In “Raiders of the Deep,”
Lowell Thomas’s collection of U-boat
memoirs, a German commander tells of
a torpedo, fired point-blank from a
British sub., which vaulted his deck.
Writer saw a parallel in Stavros Harbor,
Macedonia, in 1918. The old cruiser
Endymion and the monitor Abercrombie
were moored inside the boom defence.
It was a fine summer evening, with a
group of us R.N.A.S. men swimming in
deep water. A terrific explosion on the
Endymion’s port side and her sudden
listing announced that a German sub.
had negotiated the mined boom. A
second tin-fish skimmed under the Aber-
crombie’s stern and dashed up the single
beach, finishing up harmlessly near the
Y.M.C.A., where biscuits and tea were
being consumed. Khaki figures fled hur-
riedly in all directions; the story ran
that hardly had the tin-fish’s props
stopped whirring when a perky V.A.D.
was photographed thereon. We saw
nothing of this, however, for the Aber-
crombie’s gunners had opened fire with
9.5’5, and as the sub. had been close
alongside us in a channel we were all
engaged in making good time shorewards.
* * * * «
“Biltong”: “General Smuts,” pro-
nounces London “Times,” “from being
a leader on the smallest of stages, has
become a great Imperial thinker whose
word counts not only with Britons but
far abroad.” Which recalls how curi-
ously diversified were some of the small
stages on which Smuts first showed his
capacity for leadership. His first notable
success was when he obtained a double-
first in the Law tripos at Cambridge. The
beginning of the Boer War found him
State Attorney of the Transvaal under
Kruger; at the end of it he was in
supreme command of the Boer forces in
Cape Colony. He could have had a
high command during the Great War,
but on Botha’s advice declined it to be-
come a member of the Imperial War
Cabinet. In 1919 the man who had
shown an equal ability for law and
soldiering began a five years’ term as
Prime Minister of South Africa. Rhodes
Memorial Lecturer at Oxford, Rector
of St. Andrew’s, scientist, author, the
many-sided Boer is a humorist withal.
When presented with the freedom of
Sheffield, he told his hosts that he
valued the distinction all the more be-
cause he had spent two or three years
of his life “dodging Sheffield products.”
PIGEON-BLOOD RED.
“Pigeon—blood red is the shade of a new nail
lacquer that has taken smart feminine London by
storm.”
She’s a picture that holds you, a vision that
knocks
In the newest and smartest of hats and of
frocks. .
The ravishing wave in her radiant hair
Remains a supremely artistic affair.
She’d a generous helping of charms for a start
From Nature; for more she’s indebted to Art.
And she’d turn, I imagine, Qn anchorite’s head
With her finger-nails lacquered in pigeon-blood
red.
It’s perfectly plain she’s a pet and a love;
Her eyes are as blue as the heavens above,
And her hair is as golden, it’s safe to pro-
nounce,
As the metal that brings seven pounds to the
ounce.
(Supposing your fancy inclines to brunettes
You can alter these shades to their opposite
sets.)
But, blonde or brunette, if she’s properly bred,
Her nails will be tinted with pigeon-blood red.
A glorious vision, she trippingly hops
From pulchritude parlors and prettiness shops.
She’s learned —and by methods no man may
detect—
What powder can manage and lipstick effect.
But it’s needful, before she’s accounted 0.K.,
To be polished ad unguem, as Latinists say,
And the last touch of all on her beauty is shed
When her claws are invested with pigeon-blood
red.
I wonder, when Paris, on Ida of old,
Awarded to Venus the Apple of Gold,
Would his pastoral judgment have faltered,
d’you feel,
Had the goddesses stooped to this sort of
appeal,
These curious aids modern fashion demands
(And, remember, their feet were as bare as
their hands)?
Would Juno have grabbed it—or Pallas, in-
stead —
Had their toenails been lacquered in pigeon-
blood red?

POLITICAL POINTS
Last week the Prime Minister had a
wild night drive to Sydney to get hospital
treatment for a sudden illness—happily
not serious. In his absence, Page is
carrying on as leader of the House, and
the U.A.Ps. are arguing whether Men-
zies or Parkhill is their deputy-leader.
N.S.W. members,' aggrieved at “the pre-
dominance of Melbourne” in the Min-
istry, want it put to the vote.
Parkhill, opening for the Government
in defence of its Budget, made such a
poor showing that even “Granny’s” gal-
lery-man poked fun at him.
He grew redder and redder, became more
and more breathless; but. did he mean
exactly what he said when he declared
that the confidence engendered by the re-
turn of stable government had induced
the great secondary industries to extend
their tentacles?
Menzies never invites ridicule by mis-
using language or losing his temper.
It has been suggested in Melbourne
thaf the Commonwealth should establish
a corps of marines. If Australia is to
have Guards and marines, why not
And all jobs might be reserved for
retired politicians.
Beefeaters and a Constable of the
Tower? We haven’t a Tower, but it
would cost only a few hundred thou-
sand to erect one at Canberra.
Argyle is not keen on the Canberra
proposal to spend an unspecified number
of millions on unifying the railway
gauges between capital cities. “The
future of rail transport,” he says, “is
uncertain”; and he might have said
more. The one thing certain about rail
transport is the annual deficit.
N.S.W. Premier Stevens has had to
admit another “regression,” as he calls
it. For four months of the present finan-
cial year expenditure exceeded revenue
by £1,890,400, as against £1,391,600 in
the corresponding period of 1933-34. He
attributes most of the “regression” to an
“increase of £361,000 in contributions
to sinking fund.” There was also an in-
crease of £lOO,OOO or so in the outlay on
civil-service salaries, but little is made of
that. An election is coming on.
Every time a man drinks a pint of
beer after his day’s work the Government
takes 3d. Excise on beer was 2s. a gal-
lon till last year ; then 3d. was taken off
—something for the brewer and the
publican, but nothing for the public. In
effect, the beer-drinker is penalised be-
cause he prefers beer to the fizzy drinks
which the teetotaller consumes in such
vast quantities. There is no excise on
fizzy drinks.
Tasmania s Leg. Council has embar-
rassed the Labor Government by jibbing
at its proposal to restore 50 per cent, of
the cut made in salaries of members, as
well as those of civil servants. That
concession was promised on the hustings
and the Council allows that the Govern-
ment can claim a mandate for it; but
it protests that extension of the boom to
politicians was never mentioned. So it
carried a curt amendment to the Appro-
priation Bill. Though the amendment
can’t be pressed, it’s annoying to have co
attempt a defence of the indefensible.
State members’ salaries have been
discussed in South Aus., too. Condon, a
Labor M.L.C., unavailingly objected to
the continuance for another twelvemonth
of the reduction to £360 p.a., saying that,
in the case of a married man, 6s. a week
was collared for income tax, while
some of us have to pay 4s. a week for
party purposes.” Still, even £334 p.a.,
with club privileges and a railway pass,
is dashed good pay for the little Leg.
Councillors have to do. Two guineas
a sitting, with some travelling-time
allowance for country members, would
be enough for what should nowhere be
regarded as a job.
Fallen Prime Ministers are as common
in Paris as fallen Labor leaders in Syd-
ney. The latest is old Doumergue, who,
summoned from his retirement in the
national emergency last year, has been
dropped because he proposed to intro-
duce safeguards, frankly modelled on
British procedure, against the dangerous
instability of French politics. In his
extremity he was deserted by the Radi-
cal Socialists, a shabby, pro-Bolshie lot,
and reviled by the Manchester “Guar-
dian.” History will be kinder to him.
Some good men sit behind Stevens
and Bruxner, but so also do mediocrities
and duds. If the two leaders can manage
it, the middling and hopeless, as well as
the good, are to be put up again with the
Ministerial brand on them, and no others
need apply. With preferential voting there
is no excuse for such a blow at the
rights of the general body of supporters
of both parties, and it may be very bad
business for the coalition. It is only
two months since Tas. Labor, which has
abandoned pre-selection, captured three
seats from U.A.P. Ms.H.R. standing
alone, one a Minister; but evidently
the lesson was wasted on Stevens and
Bruxner.
Like so many other pacifists, Herr
Egon Erwin Kisch is a pugnacious-
looking person and talks in a belli-
cose strain. He asserts that he was treated
“like a gangster” by passengers on the
Strathaird (they deny it); that he was
wounded eight times in the war; that
Hitler had him and nine other authors—
unnamed, but all eminent, though not
so eminent as Herr Kisch —confined in
a small cell, and eight died, and that the
same Hitler put the Australian Govern-
ment up to prevent him landing. Seem-
ingly, he has at least one qualification
for writing romances.
Herr Kisch denies that he is a Com-
munist ; yet at his Sydney Domain meet-
ing he shouted “Red Front!” and raised
a clenched fist in the German Com-
munist fashion. Thaelemann, the Com-
munist who “gained seven million votes
when he stood for President,” he de-
scribed as “our leader.” And the meet-
ing opened with the “Internationale,” the
anthem of revolutions, which bids “ser-
vile masses to arise” and “rally” and
“face the last fight” and make the
“thieves disgorge their booty.” To hear
the good man speak of pacifism in such
circumstances is like watching an angry
Alsatian dining on lettuce.
How necessary it was for Lyons to
come to terms with Page has been shown
by some of the speeches in the belated
Budget debate. Amidst approving roars
from the Labor benches, Lawson, the
member for Macquarie, let fly at the
Government’s relief-work schemes, and
suggested reduction of working hours.
The young gentleman had already
promised to support the civil servants’
pay-restoration plans. When Hawker
tried to put in a word the young man
said Hawker had “always viewed life
from the dress circle.” He has viewed
it from a hospital ward often. Hawker
was fighting in France when bustling
young vote-catchers now in the U.A.P.
were playing with popguns.
Early last week Bolivia was deliriously
excited over a great victory in the Gran
Chaco. The army was undecided whether
“A fellow must dress the part, what?”
it would go straight ahead and annihilate
the enemy or wait until after the rainy
season and do the job in comfort. Four
days later the Paraguayans were even
more elated over a great victory. Seven
forts and 10,000 prisoners were claimed,
placing Paraguay definitely “one up.”
Bruce, commissioned by the League to
stop the war, looks like having the tough-
est job of his career.
Administration of the war-service-
homes business will test Thorby. When
N.S.W. Minister of Agriculture he was
regarded in some quarters as a hard
man, and he is now in a job in which
hardness is' not required. A great many
of his clients are in difficulties which call
for understanding and sympathy. The
interest rate has been reduced from 4\ per
cent, to 4 per cent., but this, while accept-
able, is not much good to men who were
charged £llOO or £l2OO for houses doubt-
fully worth £BOO or £9OO now, especially
if they can get only casual work.
An unemployment report issued by
Dunningham, the N.S.W. Minister of
Labor, stresses the fact that “the building
trades are of prime importance; their
ramifications are very great and far-
reaching.” Dunningham nevertheless
acquiesces in the rejection of the plans
for the £250,000 Sydney theatre, partly
on grounds which were waived when
there was a building boom.
A writer in the “Worker,” exulting in
the victory of the New Dealers, predicts
that the fruits will include “a greater
public-works programme and extended
employment relief.”
Most important of all, the Roosevelt
Government will now be able to proceed
with its policy of nationalisation of bank-
ing and credit along the lines advocated
by Labor in Australia.
An obvious case of the wish being father
to the thought. At the same time it is
clear that U.S. Labor is behind Roose-
velt. An “English Reviewer” writes that
every American Federation of Labor
official has a photo, of the President over
his desk.
Westralia expects no more than 241-
million bushels of wheat this year. It
harvested 53£ million bushels in 1930, the
year in which Scullin-Labor promised the
farmers 4s. a bushel at siding. That
started the rot.
A talkative old gentleman named Col-
lings, a Senator from Queensland, has
startled old ladies with a lurid account
of a “subversive organisation known as
the Commonwealth Legion,” with “6000
armed members in N. S. Wales, machine-
gun companies and cavalry units in
Queensland, brown shirts and blue star-
shaped badges marked with a swastika” —
all waiting to rise and establish a Fascist
dictatorship.
Reading from an unsigned typewritten
document. Senator Codings declared that
the Fascists had planned simultaneous
action in all States. Their plot had been
unearthed by an unknown man.
Comrade MacDonald dryly suggested
that Comrade Codings had stumbled on
a mare’s-nest. A journalist, he is doubt-
less familiar with bloodcurdling narra-
tives on unsigned typewritten documents.
But Comrade Codings was quite huffy
about it.
Just when it is confidently expected
that Mr. de Valera will bring in a law
to the effect that he has thrown off the
foreign yoke, a traitor has been dis-
covered getting signatures to a petition
for the amalgamation of part of Done-
gal with Ulster. He has been warned
that frightful things will happen if he
doesn’t desist. But isn’t he just trying
to apply the sacred principle of self-
determination?
“Speaking of Russia”—the “Saturday
Evening Post” is doing the speaking—
“what has happened to the orders for
half a billion dollars which we
were propagandised into believing we
would get from that country im-
mediately we recognised it?” Faded
into hot air, no doubt. It has been
the experience of every country that has
signed a trade agreement with the Red
Republic ; but Roosevelt and the people
he has surrounded himself with—Mr.
Richburg, Mr. Tugwell, Mrs. Perkins,
Mr. Moley and Professor Swope—were
supposed to be such a downy lot of
birds.
Queensland Premier Forgan Smith and
Godfrey Morgan, once Minister of
Railways, have had another brush.
Morgan chuckled at Forgan; For-
gan rapped out something about “the
loud laugh that speaks the vacant
mind.” Morgan said Forgan was
getting a swelled head. Forgan rose and
“Premier Forgan Smith has described Mr.
Thomas, the Dominions Secretary, as ‘the
most audacious bluffer in the Empire!’”
“‘O Caledonia, stern and wild !’ ’Scuse
me for mentioning it, Ramrny, but
this kind of thing breaks a man up.”
moved that Morgan be suspended for
three days. The division bells formed a
chorus while Morgan told his opponent
that he was “yellow” and “the most
cowardly man who had ever been
Premier.” He left for his enforced vaca-
tion remarking, amid cheers and howls:
“It’s a dirty game.”

Rev. A. Rivett, who, at 79, dropped
dead while speaking in Sydney Domain
on Sunday, was a Congregationalist min-
ister who turned Unitarian. Journalism
and speechifying against war and capi-
talism had monopolised most of his
energies during the past 10 years.
He fathered a brilliant family; one
son, who married a daughter of Alfred
Deakin, is a distinguished scientist, and
another is a Macquarie-street doctor; a
daughter is prominent in women’s move-
ments.
“H.G.”: Every old Duntrooner will
regret the passing of Major Jimmy
Costello last week. His active service
was done in the Boer War, and he
favored the violent disciplinary methods
of his age, but he was a lovable old
boy and he knew his job. He went to
Tasmania at the beginning of the cen-
tury, then came to Victoria Barracks,
Sydney, and finally went on the Dun-
troon staff, in which capacity he put
hundreds of war-time officers and
n.c.os. through their paces. He tried to
go to the World War —but he was just'
on 60 when it began.

public service, and gives the answer to
those who say the Government employs
only the waste products of the profes-

crowds still gather round the vast monu-
ment on fine Sundays and holidays. High-
brow artists say it is representational and
otherwise awful. Jagger was himself a
gunner who volunteered early in the
war and collected an M.C.
R. A. Prendergast, who went west in
the Longreach air smash, will be a
loss to Imperial Airways. A big, steady
careful man with a naval training, he
knew as much about the London-Singa-
pore route as any man alive. He was
one of the R.A.F. pilots who rescued
580 Europeans and their belongings from
Kabul under almost unbelievable
weather conditions when the Afghans
decided to get rid of Amanullah. A lot
of Australians had flown with him, both
on the cross-Channel run and in the
Astraea when she was here last year.
“Fleet Street”: The creator of “Wee
Macgregor,” J. J. Bell, who died last
week, had the reputation in London)
Savage Club, where he spent much of
his spare time, of being the readiest
writer that Scotland has sent to England.
Over a period of 30 years Bell wrote
an average of two long novels p.a.;
in addition, magazines and daily papers,
British and American, published dozens
of articles and short stories by him every
year. Like W. W. Jacobs, he made his
name as a humorist, and (also like Jacobs)
he went on to write some of the best
horror yarns of his time.
J. A. Coonan, dead in Adelaide at 71,
is remembered in Westralia as a gold-
hunter ; he won fame in S.A. as pub-
lisher of the “Mail.” He was a pioneer
of the rowing game and a powerful foot-
baller, and latterly a bowler of consider-
able skill.
This is the im-
pression Frith got
of Herr Egon
Kisch, as seen ful-
minating in Sydney
Domain. The He-
brew who says he
has travelled 15,000
miles to deliver
Australia from
Fascism possesses
a sense of the
melodramatic that
a movie star might
envy. He arrived
at the anti-Fascist
meeting from the
direction of Syd-
ney Hospital
slumped wanly
but smiling brave-
ly in the arms of
four staggering
comrades. Hoisted
with difficulty to a
Communistic lorry,
he defied Hitler,
was kissed by a
female admirer,
accepted a large
bouquet of red
flowers, waved
gaily to upheaval-
ist fans in the
crowd and ex-
hibited the latest
thing in revolutionary gestures. All
somewhat Sim Tappertitish; but first-
class showmanship.
Mrs. Marguerite Callaway Mahood,
who staggered the arts and crafts world
of Melbourne by selling half her 200
exhibits of local pottery on the first
day of her show, is a League of Nations
in herself. Her father is half Welsh
and half Irish ; her mother is 50 p.c.
French and 50 p.c. Maltese and Scotch.
An uncle named Angelo Azzopardi be-
longed to the local Caledonian Society,
played the bagpipes and used to recite
bits from Burns at social gatherings. He
got his Scottish blood and sympathies
from his mother.
C. T. Wood, the new head of N.S.W.
Child Welfare Department, came back
from the war with an artificial arm and
leg. For a time he was Chamber Magis-
trate at Sydney Central, his job being
to give fatherly advice to litigants and
stand between the Law and those who
couldn’t pay its money penalties on the
nail. He couldn’t have had a better train-
ing for his new duties.
Brigadier C. H. Jess,
C.M.G., C.8.E., D. 5.0.,
was one of the star organ-
isers of the A.I.F. (he
finalised demobilisation in
England, among other
feats); he is Commandant
of Victoria, and he was
born in Bendigo. It
made him an almost
inevitable organiser of
the executive committee
of Melbourne centenary.
He left in September,
1914, as a staff captain
with the 4th Brigade,
and by 1918, when
only 34, he was in com-
mand of the 10th Brigade.
A “regular,” he was Com-
mandant in Tasmania be-
fore going in that capa-
city to W.A. in 1927.
An American who
knows as much as anyone
living about Bligh and the
Bounty mutineers has ar-
rived in Sydney from
Papeete—C. B. Nordhoff.
His “Mutiny,” written in
collaboration with J. N.
Hall, which describes
Bligh’s open-boat voyage,
was a book-of-the-month
choice in America and an
English best-seller. Another novel (also
written in collaboration with Hall) which
deals with the tragic lives of the
mutineers on Pitcairn began as a serial in
the “Saturday Evening Post” the other
day.
“Gourmet’s” valedictory:
“Mitchell of the Australia” is gone. In
the course of his 40 years’ service he saw
Sydney’s chief hotel rise from a very humble
status to that of one of the most celebrated
in the world among those who travel the
world. And he had much to do with the
Australia’s success. A small, diffident, almost-
insignificant-looking being who, during most of
his career, actually sported a moustache, he was
nothing like the average European’s concep-
tion of the major-domo of a luxury hotel;
but he had qualities which made him the ideal
man for Australia: a cheery, democratic
manner which never impinged oft familiarity;
a miraculous memory for names and faces; a
sound knowledge of food and wines (even such
visiting epicures as Gilbert Frankau learned to
take his advice blindly on these subjects), and
a tact and firmness which enabled him to
handle his waiters to perfection. Henry Joseph
Mitchell was a great man in his way, and it
wasn’t a small way either.
The late Henri Verbrugghen, organ-
iser of the Conservatorium, was one of
the boons for which artistic Sydney had
to thank the Holman Government. He
was an amiable little man, with a strong
sense of humor and more than his share
of brains, quite apart from his musical
gifts, but he could be acid-hard where
cant in art was concerned. He could
lecture, he could play the violin (he
began his career as a violin soloist), and
above all he could conduct. His chief
aim in coming to Sydney as first director
of the Con. was to raise the Australasian
standard of music, and to that end he
spent so much money—in fours of the
other States and M.L., and otherwise—
that he frightened some of those who
had had most to do with bringing him
here. Minneapolis, home of the U.S.A.’s
best symphony orchestra, outbid N. S.
Wales for him in 1921 ; but his health
was failing when he went to America.
He had a stroke there three years ago,
and was never the same man afterwards.
Australians take a personal interest
in Dick Sheppard, who has become
Canon of St. Paul’s, London. Many
Diggers met him when he was a padre
in Flanders, few Australian visitors to
London who liked an ecclesiastical thrill
missed visiting St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields
when he was in charge there, and he
used to be a sound cricketer. He is
England’s most magnetic and original
preacher; the only one who has had to
ask worshippers at an afternoon service
to get out and make way for those who
couldn’t find a place in the morning. His
Brigadier-General C.H. JESS.
health broke down in London, and he
goes back there now from Canterbury
Cathedral, where he has been Dean.
“Verax” adds to a fine story:
Re “The Resourceful Australian” (B. 7/11 /’34),
the man who picked up the Dutch ’plane’s
SOS was C. W. Monks, of the Taxation De-
partment, Hobart. He immediately got in
touch with the department and informed it
that the Dutchmen were working on 600-
metres, and were not being heard by Victorian
stations. Cyril Monks was one of the first wire-
less operators to be appointed to the R.A.N.
He and his twin brother Alfred (also a wireless
operator) were sent to London to join
H.M.A.S. Australia when the battleship was
launched. Later he was transferred to the En-
counter, and was in the German New Guinea
scrap. He then went to the Mediterranean on
the Yarra, one of the first Allied warships
to enter the Dardanelles. Incidentally, after
all this service all the Government has to
offer this wireless expert is a job in the Taxa-
tion Department! All his spare time is spent
at his wireless station at Bellerive.
Norman Chapman, pilot of the Ata-
lanta, who was killed in Queensland six
weeks ago, would probably have been
on the machine which crashed at
Ilfracombe had he not met his death
earlier. Alternatively, there was a pos-
sibility that he might have returned to
his old job on the Melbourne-Tasmanian
service, in which case the chances are he
would have been piloting the Miss
Hobart, which has been missing with all
on board for the past month.
Velia Ercole, whose “No Escape” was
a Bulletin prize serial, has just had
“Dark Windows” published and well
reviewed in London. She is the seventh
Bulletin winner to follow up with an
English success.
Artist Frank Dunne, who has made
the good-humored face of the Digger
famous, and his own name with it, has
got together a batch of his best draw-
ings of the kind, which are to be issued
in book form. The collection will be
on sale this week, price 25.; a capital
inexpensive gift for Diggers.

Thousands of enthusiastic
testimonies to
SUPER PLUME EmU
Here are extracts from
a few of tliem : —
"Your Super Plume Ethyl has made a new car out of my 1924
liP Master Six Buick-its power is greater and I get more miles.",
”My Hudson has done 70,000 miles and I often experienced
9 knocking trouble on hills. On Super Plume the knock
disappeared, and it runs smoother.
• ''I tested your Super Plume in my Packard Eight Sedan ..the
motor is decidedly smoother, and more flexible. It gives
greater power, and detonation is non-existent.
• "I was astonished at the vast increase in pulling power of my
Vauxhall after filling up with Super Plume . .. I also get an
increased speed of approximately 8 miles per hour."
• "Having used your Super Plume Ethyl in our 1934 Chevrolet
1930 Chevrolet, and a Baby Austin we must say that the
improvement in performance is simply amazing.
• "You're right about your Super Plume-lt's the greatest spirit
I have ever used and I have tried practically all of them-
My Ford V8 shows increased mileage of 10 per cent."

This co. merged the interests of Sun
Newspapers and S. Bennett in 1929. It
paid £1,700,000-odd (in scrip) for the
goodwill of the pair, plus another
£575,000 —£400,000 in prefs. and the
balance cash—for the goodwill of the
daily and Sunday “Guardian.” Slump
made some of the flock so lame that they
quickly became a nuisance. To protect
the earnings of the chief contributors to
the pool (the daily and Sunday “Sun”),
publication of the “Guardian,” “Tele-
graph Pictorial” and “Evening News”
was discontinued. The “Daily Tele-
graph” was afterwards revived.
With the recovery in conditions gen-
erally, retailers and the picture cos. spent
more in advertising. This and a more
or less free evening field —the “World”
was soon out of the race —gave the
earnings of Sun Newspapers a lift. It
was hardly to be expected, however, that
these would show a satisfactory return
on the whole of Associated’s inflated
capital (£3,593,860 at September 30,
1932). So 10s. per share (£1,052,120)
was slashed off the ords. in 1933, en-
abling them for the first time to get into
the picture. It also enabled the co. to
rub out the £577,470 at which the good-
will of the “Guardian” had been capi-
talised, together with £9150 of prelimin-
ary exes., and to lop £465,500 off the
figure at which the Bennett Co.’s shares
appeared (now £171,982). The prefs.
(there are 1,490,192 of them, 7 p.c.
cumulative) were not interfered with.
During the last term the spring in
income was £19,909, due, apparently, to
a bigger contribution from Sun News-
papers, which is lumped with returns
trom the co.’s own trading in the sheet.
Visibly, the Bennett Co. made a loss of
£13,004, not taken into account in this
holding co.’s p. and 1. figures, which
compare as follows:
„ , 1931. 1933. 1934.
f rom subsidiaries .. £103,908* £177,343 £197,252
l s *® 3 37,277 21,550 21,601
Jet-. ... .. £66,631 £155,793 £175,651
After deducting loss on “Guardian,” £15,777.
Leaving out of the reckoning £20,000
reserved for depreciation, adequate pro-
vision for which “has been made in all
allied co.’s accounts,” the net result (up
£19,858) was 6.9 p.c. on the £2,542,885
of capital, and an all-round 6 p.c. was
distributed as against 5.4 p.c. and 5 p.c.
to the prefs. and ords. respectively in the
previous term. Under the N.S.W. In-
terest Reduction Act, the prefs. advance
with the ords. from 5.4 p.c. to their
original contract rate. An all-round
7 p.c. would call for £178,002.
The market prices the prefs. at 255.
3d. and the ords. at 265., at which figures
they return 4.7 p.c. and 4.6 p.c. respec-
tively on the basis of last year’s distri-
bution.
To pay a further £21,000 to Smith’s
Newspapers on account of the “Guar-
dian,” carry an extra £30,996 of debtors’
balances and £5433 of stocks, the co.
leant upon sundry creditors for a further
£13,716:

The shareholding in Sun Newspapers
(970,498 £1 shares paid to 18s. and
34,750 10s. shares paid to 95.) figures
at £2,517,477, or £1,371,000 more than
the net tangible book value, while the
Bennett Co.’s scrip (424,988 fully-paid
pound shares) appears at' £151,083 less
than its net tangible book value. Thus
the whole of Associated’s ords. and a
shilling or so of its pref. capital are un-
represented by tangibles in the books.

The appearance of the “Star” (it comes
out of the same stable as the “Argus”)
has done the “Herald,” this co.’s chief
money-spinner, no harm. In the past the
co.s competitors in the evening field
have had no luck ; still, the past cannot
always be taken as a reliable guide to
the future. All that’ can be said defi-
nitely is that the co. has a sparkling his-
tory, and is well equipped, financially
and otherwise. The board sums up the
year’s trading activities in this way:
The “Herald” has now greater sales and
more revenues than before its competitor
was launched.... The co.’s other journals
have maintained or improved their position.
Our investments in other newspapers, in
broadcasting activities and in Newspaper
House are in a sound condition, and have
contributed substantially to our strength.
Gross earnings (£288,217) were £748
lighter. Exes. (£138,000) were down
£l2Bl, making the declared net result
£533 better at £150,217. That leaves
out of the reckoning £36,531 net (£32,434
in the previous term) dropped into the
depreciation reserve, raising it to
£366,139, which the “Wild Cat” has
treated as genuine profit. Including the
addition there was enough to pay the
pref. div. (£8125) and show 16.2 p.c.
on ord. capital as against 15.8, 16.6, 12.7
and 30.3 back to 1930, when the ords.
got a one-for-two bonus issue. The div.
was kept at 10 p.c., worth more to old
holders.
Over the last decade £415,594, of
which £400,000 was bonus scrip, has been
added to capital, raising it to £1,225,000
in 125,000 prefs. and 1,100,000 ords.
Also, half a point was added to the pref.
div. (now 6\ p.c.), the ords. averaged
16.7 p.c., and reserves are now £280,822
in excess of goodwill (£250,000), whereas
£103,546 of the capital was unrepre-
sented by tangibles in the books after
the 1924 reconstruction.
During the year some old plant was
modernised and a new high-speed Hoe
press was installed, the lot at a net capital
cost of £87,038. The board didn’t have
to go outside for any of the money, the
more or less liquid surplus being drawn
upon for £21,061 net:

For many years the board kept the divi-
dend steady at 10 p.c. and sweetened
it with annual distributions of bonus
scrip—£32s,ooo of the £450,000 of paid
capital was provided out of surplus earn-
ings during the 15 years to the close
of accounts in 1927. This was possible
because returns from investments kept
pace with the mounting dividend charge.
The growth in these returns was due to
a run of favorable underwriting sur-
pluses (they were available to swell in-
vestments) and to rising interest rates.
But with wider policy-writing came
heavier claims, and the gift-giving
ceased about seven years ago. Then
slump lightened premium income, the
contraction in interest and rents affected
returns from investments (now lumped
in one untidy entry with net premiums),
and the London marine business became
very troublesome. It all culminated in
a loss of £12,022 in 1932 (the first thing
of its kind since the beginning of this
century), and the div. was cut in halves.
Though there has since been a con-
tinued shrinkage in gross earnings, due
largely to curtailment of'marine under-
writing and the cheapening of moneys
the improvement in the net result has
been most heartening, thanks to a steep
drop in the loss ratio:

The slip in last year’s total income was
£18,961. Of each £lOO received exes,
took an extra £6, but losses were over
J?‘s\ Ashler, leaving the net result
£21,905 better at 10.9 p.c. on capital as
against 6, a loss, 9.3, 15.1, 14.8 and 14 9

the final being at the rate of 8 p.c. p.a.
At £ll 6s. (£9 2s. 6d. a year ago) the
£lO shares paid to £5 return 3.3 p.c. on
a 1\ p.c. div. basis. The investor who
looks for 4 p.c. on his money counts on
a 9 p.c. distribution, equal to 4.4 p.c. on
the co.’s own funds (capital and reserves
combined). In addition there is the return
from underwriting.

porium, Melbourne, which bought con-
trol from the Marshalls in 1928, paying
30s. each for two-thirds of the holding ;
the other third was taken later at par.
The new management adopted a
vigorous trading policy, similar to that
which proved successful in the parent’s
own State; there was a clearance of
stocks, and profits almost disappeared in
1929 ; the organisation was overhauled,
premises were remodelled and attention
was given to manufacture of much of
the co.’s requirements locally—Holden’s
old King William-street freehold was
bought to house some of the manufac-
tures.
There has been steady improvement
in the figures over the last five years.
During the last term, there was more
money about, unemployment decreased,
and the co.’s gross earnings (£292,055)
sprang £29,734. Exes. (£238,932, includ-
ing £15,000 set aside for the tax-
gatherer) took £23,748 of the increase,
leaving enough to show 8.4 p.c. on ord.
capital as against 6.4, 5.7, 3.4 and 2.1
p.c. back to 1930. The div. was lifted
a point', making it 6 p.c., worth 4.5 p.c.

for shares already referred to.

It was in 1920 that F. J. Cook, the
co.’s managing director, first set up in
the shoe trade with a capital of £2OO or
thereabouts. He prospered, became
attracted by the possibilities of the chain
system of trading, and in 1924, when the
business was formed into a proprietary
co., had opened nine retail shops.
The present co., formed in May, 1930,
is an amalgamation of the proprietary
and other businesses in which Mr. Cook
was interested. For the lot it paid
£ 106,000-odd (in scrip), of which £51,677
was for goodwill. There are now two
factories, which manufacture women’s
shoes only, and supply 23 of the co.'s
own shops (11 in Melbourne, seven Syd-
ney and five Adelaide) as well as re-
tailers in other States and in Maoriland.
The co. thus gathers a manufacturing as
well as a retailing profit.
Despite the overcrowded state of the
trade, the co. has been able to win very
attractive results. For the 12 months to
June 30, sales (£245,548) were £3621
better, and sundry receipts (£11,830)
were up £4050. The net' result bene-
fited by £4457 of the increase, reaching
£17,549, or enough to pay the pref. div.
(£3200) and then show 21.4 p.c. on ord.
capital as against 14.9 p.c. for the pre-
vious term. The div. was lifted from
9 p.c. to a liberal 15 p.c., making the
average a shade over 10 p.c. for the last
four years. The £4338 that remained
lifted nominal reserves to £8261, subject
to that will-o’-the-wisp goodwill (£51,677
at June 30, 1933), now lumped with
leaseholds in the sheet.
Here is the position as balance-sheet
figures show it:

When the books closed liabilities ex-
ceeded more or less liquids, including
stocks, by £6750, an improvement of
£12,388 over the twelvemonth. Of the
overdraft £32,595 is in respect of the
balance owing on a freehold under con-
tract of sale. Incidentally, the co. owns
only one freehold property, the policy
being to rent shops, for the reason that,
if custom has to be followed, there is no
difficulty in moving. This has already
proved to be a sound policy.
Though the business appears to be
well handled and continues to expand,
the 15 p.c. div. is by no means secure.
Paid capital is in 40,000 8 p.c. cum. B
prefs. and 67,195 ords., all of £1 each.
The B shares rank in front of the ords.
for capital and div. ; the board has the
right to issue up to 30,000 A prefs.,
ranking in front of the Bs. It is presently
intended to list the scrip. The ords.
have been sold privately at 445. or there-
abouts. The return at 445. is 6.8 p.c.
on a 15 p.c. div. basis, or 4.5 p.c. should
the distribution drop to 10 p.c. The net
tangible cover is 31s. 7d. prefs. and
6s. lid. ords.

The Federal Government is on the
market with £15,000,000 of 3 p.c. Con-
sols. These have a currency of 14 years,
and the issue price is £99 155., making
the effective return to the investor
£3 os. sd. per cent. It is the lowest
return the Government has ever offered ;
stiff, owing to pressure of liquid capital,
the market has readjusted itself to the
new conditions, and the Treasury may
not have to wait long for the money,
which is to be used £12,250,000 for
public works and* the balance for the
redemption of Treasury bills.
Gas Drillers, Ltd.
Gas Drillers, Ltd., is the latest co. to
set out on an attempt to provide Sydney
with natural gas. It is an offshoot of
Oil Search, Ltd., which has won high
praise for the thoroughness and efficiency
of its methods, though it has not yet
met with much luck. Nominal capital
is £250,000 in ss. shares, of which
400,000 are offered at par, one for two,
to those on the register of Oil Search,
Ltd., and Drillers, Ltd., on Dec. 8. The
remaining 600,000 are in pickle pending
developments. There is no vendors’
consideration apart from payment for
actual expenditure on geological inves-
tigations, and unless the venture becomes
a commercial producing proposition. In
that event Oil Search will be entitled
to 200,000 fully-paids, plus a royalty of
5 p.c. on the gross value of gas marketed
from any wells drilled after the first pro-
ductive one. Further, the vendor has
underwritten 80,000 shares, enabling the
board to proceed to allotment, and has"
arranged to lease the co. the necessary
drilling plant at a rental of £3OO p.a.
The operating concern has thus been
given a flying start.
The first hole is to be put down on
the Mulgoa dome, about 34 miles west
of Sydney. It is a closed structure,
located by D. Dale Condit, chief geolo-
gist lo Oil Search. Thus favored geolo-
gically, the co. claims to have a better
chance of meeting with natural gas in
the necessary quantity than had any pre-
vious deep bore into the upper coal
measures underlying Sydney and the sur-
rounding district'. The shaly beds of
the Narrabeen formation overlying these
upper coal measures provide the cover
rock for trapping and retaining the gas
moving upwards from the carbonaceous
beds. There is no doubt about the pres-
ence of gas in the measures referred to,
and thus far its calorific value has been
right; the problem is to tap a supply
in sufficient quantity. In America
natural coal-gas is a commercial pro-
position in several centres.
Placer Development will pay an in-
terim 1.80 dollars (Canadian) per fully-
paid five-dollar share to those on the
register at Dec. 3. To non-residents
of Canada this is subject to a 5 p.c.
absentee tax. Cheques for Sydney share-
holders will be mailed on Jan. 10. The
previous distribution (1.20 dollars) was
made in July last. Pato Consolidated,
Colombia, S. America, in which Placer
holds half the capital, has netted 40,000
dollars a month since the end of last
May.

Napoleon and Nell Gwynne, the two
subsidiaries of Bendigo Mines, Ltd., have
lost no time in making a start, and they
don’t intend to miss much. Each is to
put up an 80ft. all-steel headframe, now
being fabricated, two electrically-driven
850-c.f. air-compressors are being in-
stalled, and a large machine-shop to
serve both cos. is going up on the
Napoleon property. Here a 17ft. 6in. by
sft. 2in. shaft, with four compartments
(two for hauling, one for pipes and
ladderway, and the other for ventilation)
is going down. The plan is to crosscut
and drive on the grid system, thus mini-
mising the chance of saddle reefs or
adjacent formations being passed by. A
10-year contract for the supply of elec-
tric current has been entered into with
the State Electricity Commission. Keith
Cameron, formerly on the staff of Mt.
Lyell, is directing operations. A third
subsidiary, Carshalton (8.M.L.) Mines,
has just been launched to take over
leases covering about 3| miles of the
Carshalton line of lode.
Meekatharra Central (W.A.), an off-
shoot of Australian Mining Trust, is ex-
ploring the two lodes which traverse its
property, the idea being to determine
whether values throughout the bulk of
the formations are good enough to war-
rant large-scale operations or whether
only the leaders should be stoped. The
same applies to the near-by Ingliston
South Gold Development Co., which
came out of the same stable. Also, For-
syth Gold, originally formed by A.M.T.
to work a property in Queensland, has
taken over from the parent the Ingliston
and Commodore leases on the same field.
It is reconditioning the 10-head battery,
which will also crush stone taken from
the Lady Central and Ingliston South
during development. In addition to the
three cos. mentioned, Ingliston Alberts
Development and Ingliston Consols and
Fenian Consolidated, two Sydney-con-
trolled concerns, have options over other
parts of the field.

Claude de Bernales seems to have
optioned something worth while on the
Yellowdine gold find. State Mining En-
gineer Wilson reports that it is the most
encouraging auriferous discovery that
has come under his notice for years, and
' Government Geologist Forman also
speaks favorably of it. The option has
been taken over by the Commonwealth
Mining and Finance Co., of which De
Bernales is managing-director. A sub-
sidiary is being formed to dig out the
metal.

Lake Austin Eureka, which has a 31-
acre holding, including the Eureka and
the main portion of the Island Queen,
on the Murchison field (W.A.), is get-
ting a move on. A 10-head battery and
an 80-ton-per-day rock-breaker are to
be installed, and a Tangye twin-cylinder
gas-engine has been bought to supply
the extra power.' Also, a compressor
and more drills have been purchased to
hasten developments underground.
* * * *
London controllers of some of the big
gold-producers in Westralia are planning
to send experts by air to an auriferous
find beyond Laverton. The exact posi-
tion of the discovery, said to have been
known to an Afghan for over 30 years,
has not been disclosed, but is believed
to be somewhere near the Warburton
Ranges. A big outcrop, showing free
gold, is reported to be on the spot.

Kangaroo Co., Adelaide, is hopping
into the old Last Chance, Kanowna
(W.A.), and hopes to make its pile before
hopping out again. The old workings
are about to be unwatered, and the bot-
tom (525 ft.) is said to be in ore highly
payable at the present price of gold.
Hidden wealth is also stated to exist in
other parts of the show. It should not
be long before sampling discloses the
actual position.

North White Feather is the latest
Kanowna (W.A.) resurrection. Prior to
its interment years ago, the mine was
owned by a London co. The end came
when shareholders jibbed at finding more
cash. Now the show is said to possess
several “distinct lines of reef” and other
attractions which seem to have formerly
escaped notice.

North Kalgurli shareholders will
collect a 6d. div (£25,000)-next month.
Present profits from the treatment of

Western Mining Corp. has made a
progress payment of £2OOO for extension
of its working option over the Phoenix,
at Norseman (W.A.), for four months
from the end of 1934. Values exposed
in recent developments have been very
encouraging. .
Gold Exploration, Ltd., has announced
early flotation of it's first subsidiary to
acquire Kalgoorlie interests. What
these are is not stated, but they will
probably comprise areas on and at the
north and south of the Golden Mile.
* * * *
The Golden Ridge, near Kalgoorlie,
and the once-famous Gt. Fingall, near
Cue, have been taken up again. Both
were profitable, but whether they are
likely to be of much account again is
another question. The promoters are
weighing their chances of successful
flotation in Adelaide.
’ ij*
In the absence of something better,
any gold-mining lease that has holes in
the ground or excavations near by is
being pegged for flotation in Westralia.
After seeing some of them, a Bulletin
man’s thoughts turned to the Scriptures,
Matthew vii, 26, 27.

A few months ago official reports from
Lady Gladys (W.A.) indicated that share-
holders had cause to rejoice. Most of
the gilt appears to have been scraped off
the gingerbread to pay purchase con-
sideration and exes., and what' remains
doesn’t look like benefiting them very
much.

Shareholders in Rand cos. are com-
plaining. From the beginning of this
year excess profits have been taxed on
the average figures of the two months
Nov.-Dee., 1932, immediately before S.
Africa’s departure from the gold stan-
dard. Where the excess over the standard
rate does not exceed 2s. 6d. a ton, one
per cent, of the dutiable amount is pay-
able for each completed penny of such
excess. Where the excess is greater than
2s. 6d., the amount payable is “a per-
centage of the dutiable amount of ex-
cess,” determined in accordance with a
Government formula. The effect is to
induce cos. to mill a large proportion
of low-grade ore. Some shareholders
contend that this is being carried too far.

“Romance in the Rain”
This film at Sydney State is almost as
good in its way as the star item on the
bill. The main difference is that it' is a
satire on American life, whereas R. C.
Sherriff’s movie version of Galsworthy’s
novel is a photographic picture of Eng-
lish life. Roger Pryor, who writes
pashun fiction for Victor Moore, a low-
comedy publisher, picks up with Heather
Angel. The plot is based on a Cin-
derella contest which Pryor and Moore
get up to boom their literary product.
Moore’s lady-love is scheduled to win,
but Miss Angel unexpectedly gets the
judges’ verdict. By this time the maiden
has fallen in love with Pryor, and she is
distressed accordingly when he suggests
a Prince Charming contest with a radio
marriage ceremony for her and the
Campbell Copelin in “Her Past,” at
Sydney New Tiv., with fragment of
Delysia.
winner in the presence of 50,000 football
fans. Of course, he realises the situa-
tion, and takes her to his arms at the
finish. A gorgeous skit' on the publicity
methods that have made American busi-
ness what it is, and the players get un-
limited fun out of it.
They’re all good, but some have more
amusing lines than others. Notably Mr.
Moore as the elderly publisher, who,
when the hero and heroine fail him, has
to face the multitude as Prince Charm-
ing, “the dream of American manhood.”
“One More River”
An unusual feature of this adaptation
is that it follows the original fairly
closely. Diana Wynyard, looking more
like Jackie Cooper about the mouth than
ever, is the outraged wife of Colin Clive
•—an ideal Sir Gerald Corven. As the
Orient liner berths at Tilbury, the fugi-
tive is seen saying good-bye to the in-
fatuated lad whom she has met on the
way from Colombo. It would have been
hard to find a better Tony Croom than
Frank Lawton. The Rolls of her uncle
(Henry Stephenson plays Sir Laurence,
Mrs. Pat Campbell his wife) meets her
at the Docks, and her father’s Rolls (C.
Aubrey Smith is General Charwell) is
waiting at the country railway station to
which she repairs from London with Jane
Wyatt (Dinny) in a third-class carriage.
(A very English touch this proud patron-
age of the cheapest form of railway
transport by the best people.) Follows
the night spent in all innocence in Tony’s
car in a wood between Oxford and
Henley, and a somewhat overprotracted
trial scene. Dinny has been pushed into
the background, and a couple of private
detectives are given prominence as comic
villains ; otherwise the story is all Gals-
worthy.
The photographer has been careful to
get his facts right. You see a real
Orient liner come in; at Oxford you are
not only shown the High and the en-
trance to the Mitre, but a corner of the
coffee-room which will be familiar to
every patron of the ancient hostelry, and
the sequences in and near the law courts
are equally representational. Most of
the dialogue seems to be Galsworthy’s.
But it is the superb casting that makes
this movie an even more vivid picture
of contemporary England than the novel.
Diana Wynyard supplies a masterly
portrait of one of those attractive and
friendly but congenitally frigid women
who are the despair of husbands and
lovers alike ; the Temple is full of suc-
cessful counsel like Alan Mowbray (For-
syte), and the others, down to the yokels
and servants, are just right. Our censor
has done a good deal to spoil the con-
tinuity, but he hasn’t been able to spoil
the best film of its kind that Australia
has seen.
“Strike Me Lucky”
In a competition for the dishonor of
ranking as the worst talkie of 1934 this
production should lift the raspberry with-
out much difficulty. Central figure is
Roy Rene, otherwise Mo, whose success
in vaudeville has been due to far broader
humor than is tolerated by Mr. Cres-
well O’Reilly. Dialogue is imitation-
American, and glimpses of life in an
Australian city show it to be largely
populated .by the sort of screensters one
looks for in a Vitagraph farce. Acting,
is poor. A cabaret sequence includes
an Apache dance that was getting stale a
quarter of a century ago, and the whimsy
about the neglected iron which burns
through a pair of pants is introduced
elsewhere. The gangsters who pursue
Mo and his Scottish friend into Cen-
tralia and back are a feeble lot.
The screen doesn’t seem to be Mo’s
medium; he battles too hard for his
laughs. He might give better results
with a team of clever gag-merchants
such as the leading Hollywood grotesques
employ. But he would have to revolu-
tionise his stage style, which is essentially
unfilmic.
“Housewife”
It doesn’t require much nous to fore-
tell what is going to happen in this
Sydney Regent film (it supports “The
House of Rothschild”) the moment Bette
Davis appears. She carries all the hall-
Frank Lawton in “One More River,"
Sydney State.
marks of the female wrecker of happy
homes.
Until she arrives George Brent', as an
unimaginative chief clerk, and Ann
Dvorak, as his doting wife, have been
leading a drab but comparatively un-
troubled existence. Miss Davis, who
happens to be one of George’s calf-loves,
alters all that. George, who prospers in
the meanwhile, takes to going out at
x'ight with the glamorous intruder, leav-
ing Miss Dvorak alone and unhappy.
After an accumulation of scenes depict-
ing George’s infamy, the inevitable
separation looms. After which the re-
conciliations. Acting, dressing and set-
tings are better than the venerable theme
deserves.
“Splendid Fellows”
“Splendid Fellows,” which was screened
simultaneously at Sydney Lyceum and
Colin Clive in “One More River."
Melb. Hoyt’s on Saturday, is unfortu-
nate inasmuch as it challenges compari-
son with Hollywood productions which
first astounded and then bored picture-
fans. It is well photographed for the
most part, and well acted so far as
the leading parts are concerned, and it
is built around a story which, with better
dialogue, might have been made con-
vincing. To bring it up to the minute,
the centenary air race is introduced, and
the central incident is where the aviators
in the leading ’plane deliberately abandon
the race in order to save the lives of
two mates.
Three men carry it—Frank Leighton,
as the pilot of the ’plane ; Leo Franklyn,
as a comedy English manservant, and Eric
Coleman, as a flying backblock parson.'
Leighton is the son of a new lord shang-
haied by his father to “the colonies”
because he is always flying and becoming
entangled with actresses. Leighton plays
the British johnny as the real article in-
stead of the ridiculous burlesque we are
accustomed to, and scores heavily. Leo
Franklyn’s sketch of the Cockney ser-
vant is possibly the best thing in the
film. He is not the dignified butler of
the Jeeves type but a quick-brained
East-Ender. Eric Coleman, boomed as
the brother of Ronald Coleman, is quite
capable of standing on his own merits.
He can act. Isabelle Mahon, as the
heroine, plays in the manner usually
described as sweet.
Some First Nights
“Her Past,” the second comedy in
Delysia’s string, which opened at Sydney
New Tiv. on Saturday night, is hardly
a prize-winner in its class. The plot
has seen better days and the humor is
obvious. But that doesn’t matter much
when Delysia takes the stage. She con-
verts a trite and conventional role into
something quite out of the ordinary.
As Madame le Sambre, the lady with
the past, she never for a moment fails
to keep her audience interested. Madame
and her sticky antecedents are introduced
into an upper-class Berkshire home and
seem to be in for a sour time, but it
transpires that all the members of the
household feel that they haven’t been as
good as they ought to have been. It is
hard to conceive the dried-up Duchess
cavorting with a gigolo in Paris, the
otherwise healthy-minded Pamela feel-
ing secret guilt over a schoolgirlish ad-
miration of a screen star, and the prac-
tical mother being still worried over a
mild escapade of a quarter of a century
back, but these oppressions of conscience
are essential to what there is of a plot.
Under Madame’s spell these people con-
fess their misdeeds to the stranger in
their midst, and Delysia and her co.
make the proceedings seem not only
plausible but significant. Settings are
striking and colorful, and costumes are
superb. Delysia has sound support from
Campbell Copelin, suave and polished ;
Robert Coote, light and sportive ; and
Harold Meade, genial but scared. Frank
Harvey produces and W. R. Coleman de-
signed the scenery.

There was another record house at
Melb. Apollo lor “Tristan and Isolde,”
the second Wagnerian item to be
released by the Fuller management.
Austral has seldom sung so bril-
liantly. It would be difficult to imagine
a voice so suggestive of human speech
and at the same time so musical. The
variety of her phrasing was as remark-
able as the purity of her tone. Muriel
Brunskill supplied Brangane with plenty
ol the latter but not enough of the for-
mer, but in the shipboard scene her con-
tralto was magnificently resonant. Walter
Widdop gave an excellent account of
himself. Conductor De Abravanel now
has his orchestra well in hand, and earned
one of the loudest bursts of applause at
the close. A glorious evening.
* ¥ *
The Russian Ballet continues to pro-
vide audiences at Sydney Royal with
fare that seems much to their liking. In
the latest programme Spessiva has excel-
lent opportunities for the display of her
artistry in the colorful “Raymonda”
ballet, when sorrow seems to emanate
from her and sweep over the stage like
a chill wind. In the Egyptian ballet,
inspired by “Aida,” and in the Venus-
berg, which dates from “Tannhauser”—
it looks like a Norman Lindsay painting
come to life —Natasha Bojkovich is de-
lightful. She gives enchanting perform-
ance in the “Blue Bird” dance with
partner Stanley Judson, an ensemble of
blue and silver and much fluttering. The
final number, in which Spessiva and
Anatole Vilzak appear, is a contrast in
the severer classical mode.
George Blunt in “Her Past ”
For its last production for this year
Brisbane Rep. Soc. chose “See Naples
and Die,” by Elmer Rice, with Dulcie
Scott as producer. Cast was passable,
honors going to Beryl Telford and Jack
Cover in leading roles.
Dr. Bainton, director of Sydney Con.,
provided the excuse for the Melbourne
Symphony Orchestra’s extra-celebrity
concert at the Town Hall last week. The
programme included Glazounow’s Sym-
phony in C Minor, the “Cockaigne”
overture of Elgar, -the “En Saga” of
Sibelius and Delius’s musical reactions
to the first cuckoo of the season. The
visitor turned out to be a thoroughly
competent conductor with a distinctive
style and a capacity for revealing subtle
contrasts in tone, and he was enthusi-
astically received. The Town Hall, how-
ever, was only half full. The manage-
ment had committed a faux pas. It had
selected the evening when Isolde was
billed to sing her lament over the dead
body of Tristan in another part of the
town.


THE OTHER
FELLOW'S
MIND.
The Sack for Stay-at-Homes
Accept a Digger’s thanks ; but I object
to the term “broken men.” The spirit
of Anzac is not yet defunct.
If there isn’t enough employment to
go round, why not do the logical thing?
Let the blighters who ate, drank, worked
and slept and enjoyed life generally
under cover of a wall of human flesh
and blood do the tramping. Let them
be minus singlet, socks and tucker. Not
Anzacs. Sack ’em out of hand! Many
of the coldfooted cows are in jobs of
authority into which they jumped between
’l4 and TB. They take a delight when
opportunity offers in turning real men on
to the road. I know —I’ve just had an
experience, and not by any means the
first. And many of the youngsters have
no compunction about jumping our jobs.
I’m not old —38, and still as fit as in
1914, and a first-class tradesman. Give
us a man with guts enough to do the
right thing. Sack ’em! — Four Blues
and a Red (W.A.).
Fascism in Britain
Fascism is coming! I don’t know
about Australia, but it will come in Eng-
land. The literature I send you should
set your mind working. It is sold by the
Racial Fascists, and has no connection
with Sir Oswald Mosley’s Wall-street and
Leadenhall-street Fascism.
Speaking of Mosley’s brand of Fas-
cism, Lt.-Col. Graham Seton Hutchison,
D. 5.0., F.R.G.S., says: “The Mosley
movement is in our eyes solely
a financial pretence which aims
at sidetracking both the social
and anti-Semitic points in the
real reorganisation of the Eng-
lish people. For this purpose
Mosley uses words and sym-
bols partly borrowed from
Italy and partly from Ger-
many, and is attempting to
force the English people to
accept an idea that does not
exist.” Col. Hutchison is the
leader of the National Workers’ Move-
ment'. The German Nazis are now carry-
ing on intensive propaganda work for
a Pan-Aryan Europe. Japan, Germany
and Poland will in all probability be
used to bring about the collapse of the
Jew-run, godless slave-State of Russia. —
F.R.H. (London).
Marx and Douglas
As an old college chum of both, I
regret to admit that Marx and Douglas
are the greatest enemies of the causes
they advocate. I tried to read Marx at
the age of 18, got through a hundred
pages or so ahd chucked it. Since, I
have glanced over some of his books at
odd times, but they beat me off speedily.
The whole basic principles of Socialism
can be explained clearly in 1000 words,
yet Marx printed many volumes of
thousands of pages, and failed to explain
them then.
Douglas is equally at fault. I tried his
first book when it came out in 1920, and
pushed it aside after I’d covered 100
pages. Latterly, I’ve grasped the prin-
ciples through reading more articulate
disciples, and a few weeks ago I had a
shot at the Master again, only to find
him just as unintelligible as an orthodox
economist. — Theorem (Vic.).
In Defence of Spats
The Australian contempt for a silk
hat (B. 31/10/’34) is matched by our
contempt for spats, plus-fours (until they
appeared at our betting shops) and
even the walking-stick. Whatever one
may think of silk hats and .plus-fours,
spats and walking-sticks are demon-
strably useful articles on their occasions
—a winter’s day in Melbourne, for
example, makes spats as comforting as
gloves. All this dislike for things the
mob don’t do or say or wear seems to
me a symptom of social trouble.
In no communities I have known is
there the same dislike of eccentricity as
there is in Australia. Yet eccentricity
is sometimes a by-product of authentic
originality: and at the least it adds
variety and contrast to the drab exist-
ence.
Australia is one of the countries which
herd children into what Lawrence called
“horrible forcing-beds,” but which we,
for some quaint reason, call schools. If
you try to mass-produce minds and
spirits, I suppose you necessarily will
have intolerance of every departure from
mass standards, whether the departure be
a mild eccentricity like spats or the larger
eccentricity which is genius. One recalls
the mockery of Jardine’s cap by thou-
sands of youths in blazers of even more
variegated colors. The larrikin jeered
at Oxford bags until they suddenly be-
came the fashion of his own kind. Pro-
tected by the approval of the mob, he
will venture any hideousness.—O. Ren
(S.A.).
Let’s Have Facts
I’m not a Communist, and I am
sure Communism will never get a footing
in any community accustomed to demo-
cratic self-government. Nevertheless,
every thoughtful man realises that Russia
to-day furnishes the most important
economic and industrial experiment that
the world has seen, and it is only right
that its working should be fairly rep-
resented. That is just what our Austra-
“Let me see, Smith — wasn’t it your father who knocked me down with his car?”
lian Government and press are deter-
mined to prevent.
Recently our Government suppressed
a film showing a number of great in-
dustrial undertakings at work, simply
because it would have let the public
know exactly what is being done. In
“S. M. Herald” appeared an article by
one Hugh Kennedy painting a picture
of life in Russia so black as to be beyond
belief. The writer contradicts himseif
again and again. For instance, in a de-
scription of the recently-established city
of Novosibersk, which he truthfully de-
scribes as the youngest Siberian city, built
among the pine forests, he refers to the
“huge new buildings towering against the
skyline, giving way here and there to the
skeletons of once-magnificent churches,
the spires of which had been torn away,
and which are now used as workers’
clubs.”
Whence came these once-magnificent
churches in this new settlement among
the pine forests? Are we to suppose
that the Soviet Government put them up
for the pleasure of pulling them down?
—Arthur Griffith (N.S.W.).
Gas in the Bathroom
Tell “Caretaker” (B. 7/11/’34) that
carbon monoxide is slightly lighter than
air, with, which it rapidly diffuses, and
is fatal in a concentration of 0.5 per
cent, of inspired air. It is also com-
bustible, forming from 6 per cent, to
9 per cent, of coal-gas; but in a concen-
tration which would burn its victim
would be unconscious before he had time
even to strike a match. — Student (Vic.).
I advise “Caretaker” not to lower that
match. He confuses carbon monoxide
with carbon dioxide; an atmosphere of
this gas soon makes itself felt and so is
rarely fatal. The only way to play safe
with bath-heaters is to bathe with the
door and/or window wide open.—
P.B.M.S. (Vic.).
Rival Missions in N.G.
Having spent two months among the
natives in uncontrolled areas in New
Guinea, I am able to endorse the re-
marks of “Koala” (B. 31/10/’34). On
the occasion he mentions there was an
almost humorous cutthroat competition
on the part of three denominations to
get to the new area first. The threat
of an air expedition by one mission
instead of the fortnight’s journey on
foot was considered by the other two
distinctly unfair.
Often one finds that villages separated
by very short distances have been an-
nexed by rival missions. How this com-
petition can possibly lead to Brown
Brother’s good I cannot understand ; it
is difficult enough for him to compre-
hend the ordinary facts of our civilised
life without bringing to his mind prob-
lems which have vexed the world for
ages. The Kanaka is almost entirely
lacking in any code of ethics approaching
our standards; the attempt to force into
his mind a simple doctrine of right and
wrong in itself places a large enough
problem in front of him.
In one area in the island of New
Britain there was a mission-controlled
village surrounded by others of a rival
denomination. Religious instruction was
obstinately continued in that one village
instead of allowing it to be absorbed
into the denomination of its neighbors.
Surely it is time that the Administra-
tion did something to assure unifor-
mity of teaching, at least within fixed
areas. This is the case in the Solomons,
where the territory is parcelled out
amongst the different missions.—
R.G.B.S. (Melbourne).
The Influence of Diet
An avenue of research which the
C.S.I.R. has neglected is the effect of
diet on our politicians.
No hero has been a trencherman.
Julius Caesar was a modest eater ; so was
Napoleon. Wellington was a lean man
so abstemious in his time that he never
drank more than a bottle of claret at a
sitting. Hitler takes neither alcohol nor
meat, and does not smoke. Senator Mat
Reid, doyen of Australian Senators
before his retirement, terrorised the Bris-
bane Trades Hall on lettuce. Bernard
Shaw nourishes his genius on carrots.
Moses framed those laws which are
so awkward for some of us on a simple
diet with a vegetarian staple. Turned
out to grass, Nebuchadnezzar’s hair
grew like eagle feathers and his
nails like birds’ claws, and in next to
no time “the glory of his kingdom and
his honor and brightness returned to
him, and his lords and counsel-
lors” were urging him to take the dic-
tatorship. Where would he have been
had he continued in his earlier gastro-
nomic courses? Probably in the same
place as Belshazzar. Cannibals like
Thakombau and kings like the one who
died of a surfeit of lampreys are only
remembered through their untimely ends.
A few of the more corpulent and in-
dulgent of the politicians might be
handed over for experiment to the
C.S.l.R.— Maitland (N.S.W.).
Information or Intelligence?
J. G. Latham raised a highly debatable
question when he put forward the argu-
ment that mankind had acquired infor-
mation but not intelligence. Mr. Latham
had evidently in his mind the fact that
man lacks the intelligence to evolve a
system of adequately distributing the
wealth which the information at his com-
mand has enabled him to produce. That
is an axiomatic truth.
But what is the reason? Is it that man
has not sufficient intelligence or that he
has not sufficient information as to the
possible methods of distribution? Primi-
tive man, with little information as we
understand it, could boast a high degree
of intelligence befitting his environment.
Burke and Wills, civilised and educated
men, perished while abos. within a few
miles of them were subsisting, if not actu-
ally waxing fat, on the food they knew
how to win from nature. Dozens of
Arctic explorers have died on icefields
where Eskimos could flourish. In the
particular environment of each the primi-
tive man possessed more intelligence than
the white man. In fact, the troubles of
primitive man were wholly due to eccen-
tricities of nature, droughts, floods,
migration of game, bushfires and other
factors over which he had no control.
The white man, filled to the brim with
information regarding the production of
food and clothing and comforts and
luxuries, has failed to acquire adequate
information about the mysteries of dis-
tribution.
Even his respected medicine-men,
known as economists, have no accepted
beliefs. They worship idols as different
and as contradictory as the original
medicine-men who ordered one tribe to
bow down to the tiger-snake and another
to bow down to the mud-turtle.
The trouble with man is not that his
information has outstripped his intelli-
gence—for the average man is fairly in-
telligent until he begins to talk and think
in masses. It is that he has applied his
intelligence to one end and sought his
information to one end, the solutions
of problems of production. He has
solved those problems, and finds himself
in a worse predicament than he was in
before he commenced to gather informa-
tion or develop intelligence.—G. M.
(Vic.).
The Afrikander Way
That the Dutch-British fusion engin-
eered by Hertzog and Smuts is standing
the test of time is seen from its over-
whelming victory at the South-West
African elections over the German Bund,
which has presented a solid front in the
local Legislature for some years. On top
of that, the Administration has banned
the Nazi movement and given the Nazi
head, Major Weigall, a citizen of the
Protectorate, three weeks to get out of
it for good.
A pity our politicians cannot develop
the Dutch courage that kicks a pest out
of the country without further argument,
and leaves it to him to find out from the
Courts whether the hoofing was legal or
not. — Komati Poort (N.S.W.).
Government and Farm Mortgages
Mr. Stevens is reported to have a plan
for lifting the mortgage from the farm,
or something like that. Won’t it mean
another horde of Government officials?
The proposals indicate advancing Gov-
ernment money, in many cases on an
overvaluation. Valuations differ with the
opinions of every valuer. Existing Fed-
eral land tax, probate, shire, V.-G. and
bank valuations prove this to the hilt.
Think, too, of the upset to established
conditions caused by the uprooting of
existing contracts! Surely the lesson of
Lang in this matter is not yet forgotten.
Would it not be better to concentrate
upon offering incentives for the working
of underworked land? Too many
graziers sit back, expecting the land to
grow their wool, without putting adequate
labor or improvements into their under-
takings or even attempting, in many
cases, to cultivate the rich pockets and
river flats that their neighbors would
give their ears to possess.
Increase the carrying capacity of land
and you would increase rural popula-
tion ; upon this is the present foundation
of debt and Government expenditure
carried.—J.T.W. (N.S.W.).


ABORIGINALITIES
“Sideshow Sam”: Ask “Pons” (3.
31/10/’34) for the luvvermike to send
me the address of that bloke offering
half a dollar a dozen for fleas to train
so as I can grab off a good chunk of
Joe Lyons’s next loan for my old age.
We used to get ours off cats or dogs,
using a drop of chloroform on a bit of
wool to dope ’em. They came out of it
all right. I’m out of the game now, so
don’t mind giving away the trade secret
of how they’re trained. All you do is
to put ’em in a pillbox with.a glass lid,
and leave ’em to jump.
After they’ve jumped
for a day or so and hit
the lid every time,
they’re broke to har-
ness, and never hop
again—can’t make ’em
hop if you wanted to.
Then you get your
magnifying-glass and a
drop of giant cement,
and arrange ’em as
you want. Some live
for weeks, but you
always keep a good
supply of broken-in
ones on hand to re-
place casualties. Me
and old Joe had a Lord
Mayor’s coach with six
horses, and coachy and
footmen and Mayor, and two fencers
with bristle swords, and a dozen more

“Darral”: Those marks seen on the
ironstone outcrop by “Larrapinta” (B.
17/10/’34) were not made by lightning;
most probably by a prospector’s pick.
I, too, have seen lightning playing on
ironstone and other surfaces, and noticed
the bluish haze or smoke he mentions,
but no marks were ever made. Why
should there be? Isn’t the earth one
of the best conductors of electricity?
It’s when lightning “strikes” a poor con-
ductor, e.g., a dry tree, that its titanic
force is manifested.

“Kooragai”: It used to be said that
sharks would not attack blacks or black-
clothed persons, but the other day a lubra
was so badly mauled in North Queens-
land waters that she died soon after-
wards. I have known other cases,
and don’t think any hungry shark
recognises the color-line. The darkies
certainly fake more risks than other
people and with fewer tragic results. This
may be due to the fact that a black body
is not such an attractive mark in the
water as a white one. Or perhaps sharks
in tropical waters have such an abun-
dance of natural game that they don’t
worry about humans of any color.

“Jascop”: Dad had just received a bill
from the store for materials for
Sarah’s “party dress.” The cost of these
vanities filled him with indignation, and
he rushed into the kitchen to expostu-
late. Dave was reading the paper at the
table. “Hey, dad,” he called, “there’s
a lunatic escaped from an asylum down
below, and the paper says he was seen
in the bush over at Bungaloo. How d’
they catch lunatics, .dad?” Dad, with
his eyes on Sarah, waxed sarcastic.
“How do they catch ’em, eh? Well,
with totty-landi material at six-’n’-six a
yard, ’n’ fancy buckles, ’n’ buttons as
big as half-crowns, ’n’ long kid gloves”

(B. 24/10/’34)? Some years ago, before
Auckland (M.L.) possessed its large zoo,
a small private collection of animals and
birds was much patronised by the public.
A cassowary moped in captivity until it
was given the freedom of the grounds.
A more friendly and intelligent bird
never existed. It was quite usual for
two spectators, watching the lions or the
bears, to find a head suddenly thrust
between them, the thrust being followed
by an interested inspection of their bags
and other luggage in the hope of finding
provender to sample. With a few friendly
pecks the bird would depart, with swift
steps if he spied children, whose ice-
creams and buns he skilfully annexed.
He specialised also in the art of vanishing
unostentatiously when assailed.

“Rich. J.”: On Merriman’s property
at Bookham (N.S.W.) a black ewe re-
cently turned
white. It isn’t
known exactly

took place, but

vealed a clearly-
defined depth

of white wool next the skin. The outside
edge of fleece was pure black, and the
line between both colors was even
through the staple. After this, I’m not
so certain of the proverb about the
leopard and his spots.

“Hagus”: Moving some timber at
Scone (N.S.W.) which had been stacked
for two years, I was surprised to see a
giant spider spring from a suitably-sized
hole in the ground and sit up in fighting
attitude. His abdomen was about an
inch across, very sleek ; color was black
with yellow markings over the back.
Anyone know it?
* * * *
“Darral”: Near Bethungra (N.S.W.)
the southern railway line crosses a belt
of ironbark forest. So far as I could
see every ironbark-tree has one or more
mistletoe plants growing on it. Some
are so overrun with the parasite that
they seem all mistletoe, and several dead
trees have apparently been killed by it.
Gum and box are not nearly so affected.
Is the ironbark a better host, or does
the seed of the mistletoe germinate more
readily in the crevices of its rough bark?
* * * *
“Matalau-Matalia”: Australian mining
men are gold-grubbing in Fiji’s back-
yards. At Tavua (Viti Levu) and Yana-
wai (Vanua Levu) development hastens
dividend-wards, but the natives reckon
that while the Australians are so indus-
triously arranging transport, erecting
machinery, driving, stoping, crosscutting,
sinking winzes and generally poking
holes in the scenery, tevoras (ghosts) are
busy carrying the gold out of their reach.
The colored wiseacres agree that there is
gold in the heart of Mount Kasi, having
been put there by spirits, but they are as
certain as next Sunday’s kava-drinking
that the tevoras will get it out of
sight before the white men can reach it.
So if Australian shareholders want divi-
dends it behoves them to take steps
to counter the Misses Tevora as soon
as may be. It is impossible to blow
up ghosts with gelignite, nor can they
be shot with a theodolite. A rival
warlock is the only remedy.

“Selma”: If “Herpeton” (B. 3/10/’34)
doubts that snakes possess scales let him
induce his flapper acquaintances to ex-
hibit their half-worn snakeskin shoes. A
big trouble with this type of footgear is
that the scales develop a tendency to
rub and stand on end. Gumming down
is the remedy, and the only way to keep
snakeskin shoes in order is to take home
a bottle of gum with the purchase.
* * * *
“Taro”: The smellful Papuan matoa
(B. 7/11/’34) is just a close relative of
the “stinking arum,” one of the lilies of
the field which are better avoided. It is
common all over the world, and I have
myself seen it in Europe and South
Africa, this last a country famous for its
lilies which produces an extra-special
variety of the odoriferous vegetable
which has so annoyed “G.E.E.”

“L’F.”: Digging in the garden lately
I came across some seeds. Thought at
first they were cannas ;
perfect spheres, dark
and glossy, about the
size of a pea, with a
darker stripe running
at intervals like the
lines of longitude on
the globe. While I was
preparing a seed-bed the things came
undone on the ground and revealed
themselves as glossy and rather elabo-
rate sorts of slater beetles. When
touched they balled themselves again
with a click, the plates of their shells
appearing as hermetically sealed.

“Wagga”: On a farm near Tallangatta
(Vic.) they have a cat which has taken
to rearing chickens instead of eating
them. When she was deprived of her
own litter, puss discovered a newly-arrived
chick and snuggled it up under her, each
day assiduously licking-over the feathers
of the adopted one and taking it about
with her everywhere. On the same
farm are mares which suckled young
calves, and a pet kangaroo which, when
it wants a quick snooze, tucks itself in
alongside a big bull as it is lying down.
* * * *
“F.Y.7”: As “Jimmac” says (B.
7/11 /’34) a pet emu is a capital watch-
dog, but otherwise he is a curse and a
blight. One I knew was typical of the
lot. His first joy in life was the way-
laying of swaggies approaching the store
for a free-rations issue. He danced round
these, planting scientific kicks whenever
an opening occurred. It wasn’t long be-
fore the fraternity kept to the Tambo-
Blackall road on the other side of the
Barcoo and, unless it was a case of star-
vation, gave the station “brusher.” Our
free-rations bill was the smallest up and
down the river in consequence, and for
this the brute was endured. When swag-
gies were scarce he delighted in rushing
tied-up horses and causing them to break
their bridles and get away down a fair-
sized scrubby paddock. The station-
hands greatly enjoyed these interludes at
the expense of strangers —we all yarded
our saddled nags in a little enclosure
specially built for the purpose. But our
hero went too far one day. The super.’s
wife couldn’t make out why her broods
of new-hatched chicks vanished like the
rain in the river. One day she was watch-
ing a brood of a dozen when the emu
came round the corner. He didn’t see
her, and a dozen picks accounted for a
dozen swallowed chicks. Death claimed
him two minutes later, the lady doing
him in herself with the shotgun she kept
handy for hawks.
* * * *
“Enemcue”: Ever studied kiddies
building with blocks? Get about a
dozen of any solid material —wood,
stone, clay or matchboxes and kin-
dred articles —a bit longer than they are
wide, and it doesn’t matter what par-
ticular shape. Set them before the young
hopeful and keep an eye open. It’s only
a matter of time before you’ll find them
arranged in a form strikingly like Stone-
henge—complete to top-pieces in many
instances. Can the psychologists of the
Council explain?
“Feesh”: A Hawkesbury (N.S.W.)
hawk has a penchant for catfish. Fishing
at Brooklyn, near the Race, some days
catfish seemed to be the only ones about;
after several nasty wounds, we formed
the habit of taking hefty sticks with us
to bang the hooked ones on the head
with before unhooking. From the third
day, whenever we banged, a hawk would
speed from the island, and he rarely
missed catching the fish we tossed back
into the water. Sometimes we tried to
hoodwink him by simply banging on
the boat, but he never fell for our bluff.
* * * *
“Dhu”: When “Surveyor” writes of
ants building a “nest” in one night—
“right up a man’s bunk, over his fore-
head and down the other side” (B.
11/7/’34), I feel inclined to go to the
ant for endorsement. Surely it was
merely one of those brown tunnels? I
know, of course, that the carpenter ant
has no moral sense whatever. I have
demolished an entire gallery on the walls
of my Papuan residence just after break-
fast, and returned for midday kai-kai to
find that they had reconstructed the en-
tire gallery—2oft. long and perhaps lin.
in diameter. It was clearly impossible
to go on knocking down a fresh gallery
every three hours of the day or night, so
I retired from the unequal contest.
* * $ *
“Ex-Cavalryman”: I notice that “El
V.” (B. 7/11/ ’34) finds fault with the
painting of a famous racehorse depicted
as “prancing on one leg.” Unnatural? It
is only since the introduction of instan-
taneous photography that we have really-
known anything about the position of the
legs of a horse in rapid movement, in
“the flying gallop” there is a fraction of
a second in which the horse is completely
in the air. When the hoofs touch the
ground again the first to touch is that
of one of the hind legs, pushed very
far forward and forming an acute angle
with the body. At that moment the
horse would appear to be “prancing.”
The kind of “prancing” which is seen on
the frieze of the Parthenon, and in many
Greek, Roman and other works copied
or inspired by this Greek original, shows
the horse with one only of the hind
legs on the ground and the body thrown
up as though its advance was checked
by the rein ; it has been called a “canter”
by Reinach. Apart from this, of course,
is the question whether the painter is
expected to put on canvas something that
cannot be seen by the human eye.
•HOPPERS.
“And the grasshopper shall be a burden.”
—Ecclesiastes xii, •'>.
There wasn’t much he didn't know,
Old Solomon, who cast his
Bright pearls of wisdom long ago
In Proverbs for all time to glow
And in Ecclesiastes.
The blowfly curse is growing worse
For bringing sheepmen croppers;
The dingo pest was always gall,
And, for the luckless, worst of all
The burden of the ’hoppers.
Mayhap it got the Wise Man’s goat
Reiterated daily,
Each summer morn and eve the note
Upon his tired ear that smote,
The drone of the Ciccilce.
He’d scarce in mind the noiseless kind,
The flitting, crawling choppers
Of all that’s green; but, spare me days!
’Twas surely a prophetic phrase,
The burden of the ’hoppers!
They groan beneath it far and wide;
In fell, resistless motion
It sweeps, a devastating tide,
From somewhere on the Queensland side
Towards the Southern Ocean.
From day to day it keeps its way,
Disdaining checks and stoppers.
Now, you who feel inclined to swear
At adverse fate, you well may spare
A thought for those who have to bear
The burden of the ’hoppers.

Henry G. Lamond: In reply to
“Ornithos” (B. 26/9/’34), touching the
hatchings of eagles, during the past‘30
years I have examined, say, 50 eagles’
nests. Two eggs and one chick seemed
to be the rule. My own observations
confirmed the word of better men than
myself when I quoted in “Tooth and
Talon” that not more than once in a
thousand times does an eagle hatch two
chicks from the two eggs. Apart from
any theory, the rule as governed by
finance would bear that out. Twenty
years back the price of eagles was a bob
an egg and half-a-crown for claws—
those were claws irrespective of age.
That works out at one bird to two eggs
and sixpence discount, rebate, bonus —
call it what you will—for prompt de-
livery. I can’t give any reason why the
eagles on Westland should have twins
—that is, any explanation which would
be acceptable to a mixed and critical
audience —and so at that I leave it.
“Jim B.”: Three pairs of eagles have
hatched out, thrived and —I daresay—
gone forth and multiplied, on Ruthven
station (Isisford, Q.), within the last
three years. Only a fence separates the
property from Westland, where, accord-
ing to “Ornithos,” it’s simply not done.


“Lux”: Islanders in northern waters
were in the habit of drawing nourish-
ment from nature’s fount right up to
adolescence, until missionary influence
discouraged it. The native seems to have
thrived on susu. In conversation with
Panuelu,. the village headman, I in-
quired the cause of the physical deteriora-
tion in the young bucks of to-day as
compared with himself. Without hesi-
tation that oracle replied, scorning all
shame: “I bin take susu till I sign on
for master boat.” The normal age for
this would be about 17.

“On My Oath”: So far as I know
there are no sandstone ridges at Long-
reach (Q.), but the electrical storms (B.
10/10/’34) there—called Barcoos —are
terrific and take toll of both human and
stock life. It’s nothing to find horses,
sheep and cattle that have been near
trees and fences struck : hence the stand-
ing advice to get off your horse and
stay in the open. There is so great an
electrical content in the air that hair
brushed in the dark emits sparks and

“He wants it for copying angels from.”
crackles ; a blanket (oh, yes, we have ’em
to keep the heat out, removing them at
night or the beds would be too hot to
get into) thrown across the foot of a
metal bed is quite a terrifying experience
when seen for the first time. It sheets
in flame with a fizzing noise. On one of
the stations during a Barcoo an overseer
opened his knife to cut some tobacco,
He was left with only a boot on.

“Rindy”: What’s the one-meal capa-
city of a magpie? Had a handfed pet
about the place for two years when a
neighbor, cleaning out a tin-lined piano-
case used for a feedbin, discovered a
colony of mice in it. Jacko was sent
for. In less than four minutes the tally
was 21, and so far as we could judge
he only stopped then because the supply
of mice stopped. That evening he
seemed to feel the weight of his glut-
tony. The following day more so ; and
it was a sick and sorry bird that sat for
six days out on top of his pole. On the
seventh day we discovered him dead. Un-
digested mouseskins, we found, killed
him.

“Jim G.”: One would hardly give the
yabby (B. 24/10/’34) credit for rea-
soning power, yet on the M.I. areas
(N.S.W.), where there is water in
abundance part of the time and a
scarcity for the rest, he has
proved himself a thinker. As
soon as the water begins to
diminish he burrows straight
down into the clay subsoil, mea-
suring to a nicety the depth that
will hold enough water and
mud to sustain him till the next
watering season. When the
fresh water gurgles into his
haven he rises buoyant as a
cork to the surface. The little
tortoise also has a bit of com-
monsense, as for weeks before
the swamps and lagoons go dry
he and his family make a bee-
line for the nearest permanent
water, though sometimes only
to perish beside a wire-netting
fence that has been erected since
they passed that way years be-
fore. But the swallows never
learn. Year after year they come
while the channels are empty,
and build their nests under the concrete
bridges, only to have them swamped or
washed away as soon as the rains - arrive.

“Wodao”: Tell “Y.0.Y.” that 10 years
is the average life of a dog in the bush
(B. 10/10/’34). My hound, now 14 and
as deaf as a beetle, still has good eye-
sight, though within the last three years
he has been run over and badly injured
twice by motor-cars. He can thank
regular meals —one after breakfast and
another after tea, with his water-tin
always full —for his long lease of life.

“Tripod”: “Cudgerie” (B. 7/11/ ’34)
mentions that a burning hollow tree re-
sembles a revolving lighthouse beacon.
Here’s more to the same effect. The
headlands of the Endeavour River
(N.Q.) are formed by Grassy Hill (the
South head), surmounted by a revolving
lighthouse, and hilly Pt. Saunders. A
dead tree on the slopes of the latter was
struck by lightning one night during a
storm through which a Jap lugger was
racing to Cooktown for shelter. To
enter the Endeavour the luggers come
down the coast until practically abreast
of the Grassy Hill light, then turn
straight in towards the land. This Jap
skipper saw the burning tree (he after-
wards said it appeared no different from
the usual flashing light), came in, keeping
the tree on his left, and tore the keel
off his boat on the reefs just north of
Pt. Saunders.

“O. de V.”: I could have enlightened
“Bitter Bark” (B. 31/10/’34) on the tree-
climbing proclivities of black-snakes
many years ago. Jimmy, my mate, had
spotted a particularly good staghorn in a
“Mrs. ’Arris, I notice your boy always
comes lookin’ for ’is ball when the
’ens are cacklin’.”
patch of scrub on the North Coast
(N.S.W.), so I went along to give him a
hand. It was about 20ft. up a tree with
a slight lean, and Jimmy climbed in great
style. He pulled up below the fern, and,
reaching up with one hand, was scoop-
ing out the accumulation of leaves and
rubbish, when he let out an unholy yell
and let go everything. I had just time
to sidestep the big black wriggler coming
down amid the shower of rubbish, and
as he hit the ground I hit him. Jimmy
came down about the same time —a
forced landing in the middle of a big
clump of lantana, and I had to use a
brush-hook to rescue him. He is married
now and lives in a suburban villa. Prac-
tically every other cottage in his street
is adorned with staghorns, but not
Jimmy’s!

*‘Worrungmundowie”: I can’t agree
with “Marsh” (B. 17/10/’34) that the
little brown waterhen is on a par with
wild duck as a delicacy. They are soft
and insipid, and if boiled for half an
hour fall to pieces. In 1914 these fowls
came to North Queensland in millions.
I travelled from Mareeba to Croydon,
350 miles, by rail and road ; as far as one
could see the country was brown with
them, and the train and coach simply
made a lane through. None would
attempt to fly—they ran for their lives
instead. Returned over the same route
a fortnight later—there wasn’t one to
be seen. Gone, but no one seemed to
know when or where.
❖ :J« s|i
“Aragnib”: Don’t know what flying-
foxes taste like (B. 14/10/’34), but listen
to this. Wires, papers and bags had
failed to keep them out of the orchard,
so the gun was oiled. The marauders
were on time that evening, and a charge
of shot was sent into the thickest part
of the horde. Some of the bats dropped
like stones, but one, apparently touched
by a grain or two, began to gyrate down-
wards, when suddenly two others
swooped, and, each seizing a wing in
his claws, bore away the wounded one.
Do these swarms include casualty corps?
❖ ❖ * *
“Cejay”: I used to have the same idea
as “Tom Willie” (B. 26/9/’34) that when
crossing a river in flood it was necessary
to start well upstream to allow for drift.
Once backed my belief, too, with a dozen
beer to a packet of Capstans—and lost.
I arrived at the Daly (N.T.) to find she
was running a banker. I chose the best
of the two or three dugouts tied to the
bank, offered up a prayer for those in
peril on the sea and cast off, paddling
well upstream in the slack water close
to the bank. Waited for a clear run
in the debris floating downstream—and
then into it. I overshot my friend’s jetty
on the other side by about five chains.
I reckoned I hadn’t allowed enough for
drift. My friend laughed loudly and
long when I arrived. “I’ll take you
straight across in the morning and not
lose a yard.” That’s when I made my
bet. Next morning—the Daly up an-
other foot —I’d have doubled the odds.
“Just you sit still and keep her steady
while I light my pipe,” my friend in-
structed ; “these darned things tip up if
you’re not careful.” Then he leisurely
shoved off from the jetty, keeping
the dugout at an angle of 45 degrees
to the current and the. stern towards
the bank we were making for. The dug-
out, choosing the line of least resistance,
was pushed crab fashion by the six-knot
current to the opposite side. We drifted
perhaps half a chain, but that was good
enough for me. I had that beer con-
signed by the “Lone Hand” when I got
back to Darwin.
* * * *
“Croesus”: Here’s something for Abo-
liars to swallow. Hughie Fraser, pros-
pector, of Coolgardie, had half an ounce
of gold from his poverty-pot in a cup,
covered with water. Two sleepy lizards
got to the cup, drank the water and
licked up the gold.
=K * * *
“H.A.L.”: I agree that the heat re-
flected from the white surface of a
salt lake has to be felt to be believed (B.
7/11/ ’34), and the worker would soon
be blinded by the glare if he didn’t wear
tinted glasses. But what “Kieta” says
of waterbags doesn’t hold good in the
case of the men who scrape salt during
the summer months on the many salt
lakes of S.A. Each one takes out a tri-
pod 4ft. high, made of thin mallee sticks,
from which the bag is hung. Result, a
cool, sweet drink whenever you feel
like it.
* * * *
“Y.0.Y.”: Speaking of intelligent dogs
(B. 24 /10/’34), here’s a story that can
be vouched for by people of the Mul-
lewa district (W.A.). An old kelpie
bitch of my uncle’s had been taught never
to come inside the house. But one day
a sitting hen deserted her nest, leaving
one egg unhatched. Later the dog, evi-
dently hearing the lone chick squeaking
as it tried to cut its way through the
shell, brought it.into the house and placed
it at my aunt’s feet. This bitch also
suckled three little motherless pigs. She
had a two-months-old pup at the time,
but cuffedi it away to allow the piglets to
suck her, though their sharp teeth evi-
dently pricked her.
* * * *
“Cuchulain”: The bushman’s half-
closed hands as a characteristic (B.
31/10/’34) are a result of riding. A
horseman’s habit of holding his reins
loosely with hand closed and no neces-
sity to open it results in many a little
finger permanently rolled up—it is an
impossibility to open the little fellow
out at all.
# Ht t- *
“Imalyre”: “Airline’s” vixen with the
live hen (B. 7/11/ ’34) was not uncom-
mon. The fox and its cubs are partial to
raw eggs, and no doubt the mother was
just replenishing the fowlyard at her den.
In our N.S.W. district we generally
locate the fox and family by the litter
of eggshells near their possie. They keep
the chooks underground to muffle the
cackle when they lay, so as to prevent
irate owners claiming the henbernes.
THE BUSH TELEGRAPH.
Where we wake to listen daily to a score of
magpies gaily
Co-operating in exultant song,
Where the roads are hillside ledges fit for little
else but sledges,
And the neighbors are a mile or two along;
Where the tall trees sigh for ever, and you’d
fancy that we’d never
Hear a whisper from the world away below,
There, as swift, as sure, as tireless as the
daily press or wireless,
The bush telegraph sends tidings to and fro.
Has a neighbor lost some cattle? Have the
Chinese won a battle?
Is the girl from down the river driving out?
Is the price of butter falling? Has a salesman
been round calling?
Like a flash the news goes speeding round
about.
If you take a friend out walking, you will
set the district talking,
And they’ll know, before you started, where
you’re bound;
But, if times should use you badly, they’ll be
there to help you gladly,
The bush telegraph will noise your plight
around.
And although ’twas my ambition to evade this
inquisition,
They were warned of my arrival here, I find,
And they spent long nights in settling ways
and means for my tin-kettling,
Ere I’d even asked the girl 1 had in mind.
From your cradle to your coffin it will keep
you in the oilin’,
And when I’ll cross the Great Divide I’ll
know
(If they’ve kept a clear spot waiting on a
handy bit of grating)
The bush telegraph has wised them down
below.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE 'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
SELECTING RAMS.
“Curly Horn”: Many real, dyed-in-
the-wool sheepmen won’t agree with
“Valerin” (B. 17/10/’34) about ram-
selecting methods.
Good rams of reliable breeding are
not difficult to obtain or unduly expen-
sive. At the Sydney Sheep Show this
year hundreds changed hands very
cheaply.
In every sheep area which I know,
there are reliable sources of supply. A
well-known sheepman in the Richmond
district, Central Queensland, during
the past few months has selected
over 600 excellent young sires from lead-
ing N.S.W. breeders for distribution in
his own neighborhood.
Failing the necessary funds to pur-
chase young rams, the next-best ex-
pedient is to buy old rams from
some neighboring station or large hold-
ing. By careful selection, it is usually
possible to obtain some really useful
quality, as the more prosperous holdings
mostly replace their rams by younger
stock long before they pass their age of
usefulness.
In adopting this method, the grazier
follows in the tracks of most of the men
who began in a small way under the
closer-settlement schemes. They almost
invariably chose as the basis of their
flocks aged ewes and old rams bought
from some larger holding.
The small man should, above all,
work on the principle that a few good
rams are worth a host of poor ones.
If he should ever be forced to breed
his own rams he will do best by select-
ing the male lambs from his best ewes
and letting them run until they are eight
or nine months old, at which stage they
will be showing a good indication of
their ultimate form, constitution and
fleece.
With the above maxim well in mind
he can then cull them until only a few
of the better ones remain; but, if in the
meantime he has saved enough money
to buy good flock rams, it will pay him
to emasculate the lot.
The idea of picking the lambs that
“break” “on account of their mascu-
linity” is ludicrous. Any experienced
sheepman knows that in early youth the
mongrel is almost always more venture-
some and cantankerous than the pure
merino.
“PINK-EYE” CURES.
“Hortus”: There are many cures, in-
cluding that mentioned by “Sorghum”
(B. 7/11/’34).
Another remedy had a thorough test-
ing the other day. Out of a flock of
2200 wethers, 1500 were struck. Instead
of separating the diseased animals, the
whole flock was treated four times at
intervals of three to four days between
each dressing.
Improvement was noticeable each time
they were yarded and dressed. In a few
days all signs had disappeared.
Here is the mixture: 3oz. of bluestone
and lgal. of water.
Be careful not to mix in a tin, as
chemical changes may cause trouble.
Use earthenware or glass.
The dose is three to four drops in
each eye.
“Cuchulain”: I find the best cure for
“pink-eye” in sheep (B. 7/11/’34) to be
plain kerosene. If possible, segregate the
sheep and doctor with a few drops of
the oil. If on the road and “pink-eye”
is noticed, treat at once. Every drover
has kerosene for his lamp. The main
thing is to get the sheep in the early
stages and before the whole mob is in-
fected.
“BRUNI” AND BREEDING.
“Valerin”: A lot has been written
about sheep-breeding, but the fundamen-
tals outlined by G. A. Brown (“Bruni”)
in “Sheep Breeding,” published in 1880,
have never changed. Briefly, here they
are:
That permanent improvement in a flock
is not to be obtained at a bound by
having recourse to extreme changes of
blood, even though the animals are of
the same race. Improvements gradually
effected will be found more permanent than
those produced by mating animals of
great diversity of character.
That the description of sheep chosen to
breed from should be such as are suited
to the conditions of life in the locality,
the size of the animal being regulated by
the climate and the quantity and quality of
the feed.
That good stock, bred in a locality well
suited to them and provided with ample
food, are not sufficient to ensure success
in breeding a permanent flock unless there
is also a skilful selection of the breeders
and a most rigid culling of the young
stock. Selection is the most important
of all.
The young breeder who sticks to these
rules won’t go far wrong.
SHEEP LICE IN QUEENSLAND.
“Sheepo”: Measures must be taken
quickly, otherwise the spread of sheep
lice from the Queensland coast to the
west will bring about serious results.
Compulsory dipping and quarantine
restrictions in affected Queensland areas
do not exist, as in Victoria and N.S.W.
In some eastern districts, sheep lice
have been long established, and yearly
extend their activities. A few owners
have dips, but in the main sovereigns
are more plentiful.
One sheep lice-infected will make a
whole flock lousy in a time scarcely cred-
ible. The grave danger exists, unless
compulsory dipping and quarantine are
introduced, that travelling sheep will
carry the parasites into all clean country.
Although hard to detect, the presence
of lice can always be determined by the
behavior of sheep. Irritation causes the
animals to bite themselves, to rub against
fences and trees and to lose condition.
Eggs deposited in the wool hatch out in
about seven days, and become constant
breeders. The activities of the pests have
a very harmful effect on the wool fibres.
Control is possible by the use of a
reliable arsenical dipping solution.
A Salient feature of the technique of
dipping for lice is that a clean muster
must be made. One or two sheep left
undipped in a paddock will soon reinfest
the whole flock.
FLY AND PLAIN BREECHES.
“G.F.D.”: “Jass” (B. 24/10/ ’34) is on
a good line when he says that “breeding
to produce sheep with a plain breech is
the best bet.”
Too many graziers, in their hunt for
dense-woolled sheep, overlook the body
wrinkler, which invariably has with it
the wrinkly breech —a flytrap, if ever
there was one.
I know a Moree (N.S.W.) grazier who
culls from his flock all sheep he finds
badly blown, with the result that his flock
from four-tooth up are remarkably free
from fly trouble.
CYSTINE AND WOOL.
“Jass”: Wool fibre has a high content
of amino-acid cystine.
Amino-acids, of which there are 19, are
the “building-stones” from which all pro-
teins are formed. It is generally accepted
by scientists that animals cannot syn-
thetise any which may be deficient in
their diet from others which are present
in abundance. Experiments have proved
that the full complement of “amino”
must be already formed from the simpler
chemical elements before they can build
up the proteins required for the animal’s
needs. From these results the late Pro-
fessor Brailsford Robertson and Mr. H.
R. Marston, of the C.5.1.R., propounded
the theory that the ability of a sheep to
grow wool is limited by the capacity of
its diet to produce the required quota
of cystine.
Many Australian pastures show a very
low cystine content, so that if this vital
substance could be fed artificially, especi-
ally in times of drought, wool production
might be substantially increased.
An experiment on Meteor Downs (Q.)
confirmed this idea. Bloodmeal, which
contains some 70 per cent, of protein
rich in cystine, was fed to 2000 wethers,
whilst a similar number received exactly
the same feed and treatment without
bloodmeal. The average increased wool
production of the bloodmeal group was
over 30 per cent, over that of those who
did not receive it.
Many graziers have confirmed the
Meteor Downs results by using blood-
meal and other cystine-rich compounds.
Though the cost of these took a big bite
out of the extra-wool cheque, prices
could be reduced as demand increases.
A spanner has now been thrown into the
works by a nutrition authority, A. H. H.
Fraser, of the Rowett Institute, Aber-
deen (Scotland), who points out (1) that
it has never been definitely proved that
a sheep cannot synthetise an amino-acid
(all the evidence available is in respect
of rodents and carnivorous animals) ;
and (2) that the analysis of the cystine
content of grasses is an extremely diffi-
cult job. So we may be wrong in
assuming that our pastures are as low in
this substance as we now suppose. Some
element other than cystine may be the
limiting factor. The Meteor Downs ex-
periment may have shown a similar
result, this eminent critic continues, had
some other protein-rich supplement been
employed, not necessarily one rich in
cystine—if the jumbuck can really syn-
thetise amino-acids, then any kind of
high-quality protein will fill the bill.
Further experiment seems to be
needed.
MOTOR-TRUCK SHEEP-STEALING.
“A.G.T.”: The sheep-thief in W.A.
has realised that the transport of sheep
by motor-truck is practicable.
Heavy losses have been reported by
farmers. They range from a few head
to 200 sheep, and in all cases they are
considered the work of motor-truck
thieves. Truck marks have been found
in suspicious places.
The Police Department finds detection
difficult, as the thieves must be caught
red-handed.
Sheep-dealing helps the thief. A
farmer buys a mob, brands them, holds
them for a time and sells them again.
The result is that, although branded with
his brand, the sheep are not his. There-
fore, brands prove nothing.
There appears only one way to stop
the evil. Sheep should be allowed to be
carried by motor-truck only under a
signed clearance, initialled by the police.
The only objection to this method is
that it means more legislation, but the
losses are too great to be allowed to
continue.
A USEFUL CRUSH.
“Agri”: It is made as follows: Put
up two good posts Bft. high, with a space
of 3ft. 6in. between the inner sides, and
brace across the top with a stout rail.
About 6ft. behind these put up two
corresponding posts 6ft. high. The four
posts now mark the corners of a long
rectangle.
Rail the two long sides with four
smooth rails set on the inner sides of
the posts, the topmost at the 6ft. level.
The horse to be dosed is haltered, led
into the crush, and the leading-rope
passed over the Bft.-high rail in front.
Stout rails are slipped across before and
behind him, and his head is hauled up
high enough for drenching. He cannot
back away, kick or swing sideways.
The crush can be used for dosing
cattle, dehorning bulls, etc.
WORK ON STOCK ROUTES.
“Beefo”: Both “Valerin” and “The
0.D.” (B. 17/10/’34) give sound advice
about dealing with scrub bulls and the
need for fodder conservation if Austra-
lian chilled beef is to be a power in the
British market.
The biggest hurdles confronting cattle-
men are water and finance. Queensland,
with 6,000,000 head of cattle, half of the
Commonwealth’s total, must be looked
to for continuity of fattener supplies.
The cattle are in the North all right, but
the natural breeding-grounds are far re-
moved from treatment works. Two- and
three-year-old steers can’t stand up to
long overland treks and retain the con-
dition and bloom which the trade de-
mands. And for years at a time they
can’t hoof it in at all, owing to absence
of water on stock routes.
Railway extensions to tap breeding-
areas may not be warranted, but stock-
water facilities would give a lot more
return to the State than the provision of
water and sewerage in towns which is
the staple of relief work.
All the grass in the world is useless
on a stock route which has dry stages
of 60 and 80 miles.
SILAGE AGAIN.
“W.D.Mc.”: With all deference to
Mr. W. G. Walker (B. 17/10/’34) I still
maintain that ensilage is the dearest kind
of conserved fodder. Its advocates
admit that its nutritive value is three
tons of ensilage to one ton of prime
oaten hay, and silage to be any good
must be made from good material. So
why bother with it? I am quite sure that
for every pound that Anthony Brunskill
made out of silage he made three out
of chaff, ancl I am certain that the costs
as stated will not bear analysing. For
the wealthy landowner with plenty of
plant, power and equipment, silage may
be all right as drought insurance, but
it is of little use to the struggler who can-
not finance the plant required to make
silage. And if it is not done right it is
better left alone.
TOOWOOMBA CANARY GRASS.
“J.A.N.”: “Atriplex” (B. 7/11/ ’34)
understates the case for Phalaris tuberosa.
This grass has given wonderful results on
the N.S.W. North Coast because of the
large amount of winter feed it provides.
Besides, it will not be crowded out by

paspalum. On the New England (N.S.W.)
tableland, the severest frosts do not
affect it.
Carrying-capacity tests with cattle at
Bald Blair (Guyra, N.S.W.) showed it
to be eight times better than 'natural
pasture, while at Ohio (Walcha, N.S.W.)
Ph alar is carried for a year six times as
many sheep as natural pasture.
In the past, it has been next to im-
possible to obtain guaranteed pure seed.
Also prices have been high. The New
England Pure Seeds Association (P. 0.,
Box 17, Glen Innes) has been formed to
supply guaranteed pure seed at a reason-
able price. Under its system, the grow-
ing crop is inspected in the field and the
seed sealed by a qualified agrostologist.
Seed merchants have always refused to
guarantee Phalaris tuberosa seed since
it is almost impossible to tell it from
Phalaris minor once it has been threshed.
Colonel White has not' 200 acres, as
“Atriplex” states, but over 2000 acres of
tuberosa.
TOMATOES AND CUCUMBERS.
“Ronel”: There are tomato- and
cucumber-growers who show little initia-
tive in picking and packing. Often a
kerosene-tin with a wire handle is used
to bring tomatoes from the vines to
packing-tables. The fruit are picked and
dropped or thrown into the tins, carried
to the depot and emptied roughly on to
hard board benches, sometimes into a
heap feet deep.
The kerosene-tin makes a much better
receptacle when one side is removed and
a handle is fixed as follows: Twist two
pieces of soft No. 10 wire, 31in. long,
together from the middle to within
94-in. of the ends. Spread the ends
and take one end to each corner
of the top of the tin, attaching through
a small hole and bending |in. of
the wire round. The result is a basket-
bucket which holds more fruit (stacked
up) than the ordinary tin bucket, which
is easier to carry, and into which it is
easy to carefully place the fruit as
plucked.
Plenty of buckets will save having to
empty the tomatoes until they are taken
out by the grader or packer. But should
it be necessary to empty them as they
are brought in, use a strong frame of
saplings, with wheat-bags fastened tautly
between, along the back of a narrow
packing-bench. It should be 4in. to 6in.
higher along the side farthest from the
packing side. Tomatoes may be emptied
on to the higher side from the picking-
tins. Thus fruit will not heap, and as the
front fruit is taken out for casing the
back fruit will roll within reach of the
packers.
Never force fruit into cases with the
boards, but nail slats of timber, the same
width and length as the inner case-ends
and centre partition, between the lid and
case. Bruised and cracked tomatoes
don’t pay.
Don’t rail cases loosely packed, but
don’t overfill. The distributors want full
weight, and the consumer demands
sound, attractive fruit, free from grub-
holes, bruises, cracks or disease.
The main extra point in getting cucum-
bers over the counter in “off-the-vine”
condition is to pick them first thing in
the morning whilst they are cool and
bulging with sap. Leave a “cuee” on
the vine until afternoon and it will never
regain crispness.
SPUDS FOR DOBBIN?
“J.A.S.”: At Breslau (Germany), they
have been experimenting with potatoes
to replace oats -in the ration of working
horses. Two groups were given a ration
with in one case three pounds of
steamed potatoes substituted fpr every
pound of oats. A dash of soya-bean
meal was included with the potatoes.
The potato-fed mokes retained good
condition, glossy coats, and were entirely
free from digestive troubles. Linseed- or
cottonseed-meal cpuld be used to replace
the soya-bean meal. A good many tons
of unmarketable potatoes go to waste
which might be cooked up and fed to
Dobbin to replace oats when the latter
are expensive.
SADDLE SORES.
“Overland”: “Blister” (B. 10/10/’34)
may fancy his saddle- and harness-gall
remedy, but in my 20 years’ experience
I have found there is not one application
of any use when necessity demands that
a galled horse be worked.
Some horses, owing to slight deformi-
ties, are very susceptible to collar and
saddle galls, and any bushman will dodge
them. Should, however, one come your
way as his back or shoulders crack up
try this: Use the pelts off your killers,
instead of a saddle-cloth or collar-pad,
with the woolly side to the horse. The
yolk in the wool and the natural oils
from the skin will help to rebuild the
damaged tissues.
Such remedies as common soap, which
“Blister” advocates (it contains caustic
soda and is an irritant), and drying oint-
ments, such as zinc oxide, only cause
the gall to crack under further irritation
from the harness.
I have owned several easily-galling
horses which have become sound under
this treatment.
A GOOD FLOODGATE.
“Doitnow”: Flere’s a good floodgate:
Long, heavy posts are sunk deeply
into each side of the creek bank and
anchored securely with wire. The gate
of No. 8 wire, only with netting at the
bottom if required for rabbits, is fast-
ened securely to both posts. It is then
lightly joined down the middle with
heavy tie-wire. As soon as a flood
reaches the breaking strain of the tie-
wire, the gate gives in the centre and
remains attached to each post. It is
ready to join again, with perhaps a
straightening up, in a quarter the time
of any other type.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Rolling Stone”: When setting a
dingo-trap, especially in sandy country,
pack teased wool lightly round the plate
and cover the whole trap with the ma-
terial removed from excavation. The
wool will not retain the human scent, nor
will it give any warning to the dog, as
the usual paper cover sometimes does.
File the trigger to assure a light release.
“Yamba”: Let those many breeders
who have found it difficult to get fat
ewes to bear try this: Give each of
the corpulent ones a drench of 2oz. of
Glauber’s salt per week for six consecu-
tive weeks, thus ensuring the ewes com-
ing in season twice during treatment. In
a recent' experiment on ewes which had
not bred for three years 100 p.c. of
lambs resulted.
“Gunga Din”: Try this method of
pickling mutton. To three-quarters kero.-
tin of water, add 21b. salt, 1 cup sugar
and pinch saltpetre. Place on fire and
bring to the boil, then skim. When
boiling, put the meat in and let it boil
for 10 minutes. Let the meat stand in
the liquid till cool, when the fat will
harden and form a seal over the meat.
When using, take out as much meat
as required, re-melt fat and pour back
so as to seal again.
“Arnold”: The metal end off a sulky-
shaft fitted to the top of a shovel-
handle makes a useful light rammer for
post-sinkers.
“Karaway”: Don’t waste cotton-reels.
Either whole or cut in two, they make
handles for drawers, knobs for shed-
cabinets and light outhouse doors. Put
a washer on the screw that fastens the
reel to prevent the screwhead from work-
ing into the wood.
“Valerin”: To treat big stock arsenic-
ally poisoned: Dissolve 2oz. ordinary
washing-soda in half a pint of water,
add 2oz. liquor ferri perchlor. Strain
the resultant sediment through a piece
of fine linen. Mix the sediment in a
pint of cold water and use as a drench.
Five or six doses can be given at inter-
vals of 30 minutes.
“J.M.C.”: H. Dippel, of Middle
Ridge, Darling Downs, has an unusual
crop of wheat on his farm. Early in the
year he sent to Egypt for some Egyptian
seed—commonly known as “mummy”
wheat. This crop generally grows over
6ft. high, and each stalk has seven ears
draped in long beards which make them
look like barley. The grain is very hard
and disease-resistant.

A MAN OF SPIRIT.
The pubs were shut, so the night’s
business in Darlinghurst had begun.
Smith stared at the speak-easy across
the way. A man stole up to the side
window, tapped furtively and was
handed out a bottle. He peered stealthily
up and down the street, then crept away
with the bottle smuggled under his coat.
Smith shook his head disgustedly. It
was terrible to think that men should
debase themselves like that. Fancy steal-
ing up to a side window as though you
were afraid of being seen, and creeping
away as though you were a criminal!
Thank heavens he didn’t have to debase
himself when he wanted a drink! He
wanted one now, and he was going to
get it like a man.
He sauntered out into the street, whist-
ling loudly. No side windows for him!
He could get what he wanted openly!
He swung into a store.
“A pint of metho.! ” he ordered boldly.

CRIMINAL CRASHES.
“A Melbourne horse-trader found when he
went to his stables that six of his draught-
horses had been shorn of their tails. Latei
a man trying to sell horsehair was arrested. ’
— “Sun.”
Some of these thieves seem to operate
with vile luck, and there are many in-
stances in criminal records where the re-
wards gained are scarcely commensurate
with the risks taken.
Take the case of “Plonko” Smithers.
After he had
waited every
night for a week
outside the home
of a champion
Pekinese, a fav-
orable opportu-
nity came for
him to “lift” it
during a terrific
downpour. He
got thoroughly
soaked as he
made for the
kennel. An enor-
mous bull-terrier
of the presence of
which he was
ignorant beat
him to it. They
carried “Plonko”
feet first to the
ambulance, and
thence to hospital.
He got pneu-
monia, pleurisy
and six months,
in that order.
Perhaps one of
the most ironical
cases was that of Basil Beatemup,
one of Darlinghurst’s real shrewd
nuts. Basil conceived the idea of
renting the vacant place next door
to a moneylender’s. It cost him
£24 in rent whilst he undertook the
laborious work of digging a tunnel
connecting the two places. He was stiff
enough to strike solid sandstone, and had
to quarry. At the end of two months he
got through, having lost five stone in
weight.
On blowing the safe, his haul was
a couple of two-shilling pieces and
a penny ha’penny. When he tried to pass
one of the two-shilling pieces he was
arrested. When the other one was found
on his person, he had no chance, par-
ticularly with his previous record. Ten
years. He wouldn’t have got half that
for his original offence.
No wonder some of us are glad to
stay honest. k eo
THE ’HOPPER MENACE.
The trouble that the outback cockies
are having at the present time in con-
tending with the plagues of grasshoppers
brings back vividly to mind the time
when I ran a mixed—very mixed —farm
years ago at Buttafatta.
I had had four lean seasons, followed
by two leaner ones, the last being almost
emaciated. I was aware that one more
visitation such as I had suffered previ-
ously at the hands —or beaks —of the
’hoppers and the mortgagee would pick
up the pieces. I therefore determined
on strategy in an endeavor to trick those
voracious pests.
Going on past experience, I knew that
the hordes would arrive from the west,
probably in the late afternoon, as they
had done before. I was quite close to
a river, so I got in 40 tons of salt, which
I piled thickly on the western boundary
of my property, which the ’hoppers
would, of course, first cross. My idea
was that, having gorged themselves on
the salt, they would immediately make
for the river in an effort to quench their
thirst, and thus be drowned.
My plan miscarried disastrously.
The morning after I had put the salt
down I was out currycombing one of
the cows when it suddenly became dark,
as if night had descended. I rushed for
shelter as the swarms of ’hoppers fell
on the splendid Bathurst burr crop which
had slightly overrun my lucerne patch.
Within half an hour they had masticated
everything on the place, including my
only spare pair of trousers and singlet
hanging up outside the homestead.
The ’hoppers, coming ahead of
schedule, had arrived from the east, so
as to avoid flying with the sun in their
eyes!
I was ruined. S. W. K.
THE LAST WORD.
“Well, they can’t say I never get the
last word now. I say what I want to say
and the wife just listens. She can’t
answer back. At least, if she does answer
me back I never hear her. No, I’m not
deaf. I’ve got a job as a radio an-
nouncer.”

FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME.
“An attempt at safe-blowing was probably
the work of amateurs.” — “Herald.”
The heroes when interviewed by press
representatives stressed this point. They
insisted that they were doing it merely
for the love of the game and did not
wish to be mixed up with those profes-
sionals who blew safes for profit. In-
deed, they had received many tempting
offers to turn professional, to appear in
talkies, to broadcast and to write news-
paper articles ; but they had refused to
“We expect lots of bright suggestions from you, vicar. We
know how suggestive you can be!”
leave the ranks of the lily whites. Under
the latest amateur advertising rule, they
refused to give particulars of their next
appearance.

DECEIVED.
When I came home so late I knew
that I was in for it. My wife will talk
all night if she feels that way. I was
dog-tired after the party —the work in the
office, I mean —and I determined to
ignore her if I could.
The way she said “You want to have
a good sleep” encouraged me to think
that she was in a better mood than
usual, and I realised it was a false hope
when I woke to hear the voice going
on . . . and on . . . and on.
I stuffed the blankets up against my
ears so that the voice became a mere
blur.
What a woman! She seemed able to
go on for ever, careless whether I heard
her or not. I dozed, I woke —the pro-
cess went uncomfortably, a sort of night-
mare. Only that I would not give her
the satisfaction of knowing she was dis-
turbing me, I would have jumped out
of bed and flared at her.
“Damn her!” I was still damning her
bitterly when I really dropped to sleep,
waking to find the sun streaming into
the room.
“Good morning, everybody. 2ROT
calling”
The wife stirred. “You wasteful
brute!” she complained. “You’ve left the
wireless on all night!”

THE FATAL HOUR.
They had heartily eaten their breakfast,
Their fate caused them never a fear,
Though the time tor the walk to the

Was now drawing terribly near.
A clock struck the hour; the scaffold
all set,
The ropes placed the usual way.
Authority spoke; the bricklayers now
Commenced on their work for the day.

PEEPS AT THE PROFESSIONS.
XIII. — The Big Businessman.
“Now, my son,” advised the father
To the youngest of the clan,
“If you’re sure that you would rather
Bea great Big Businessman,
You must drop those foolish notions —
Chivalry is dead. Fairplay
Gets no mention in the textbooks
Of the business world to-day.
There’s one rule clear and concise—
‘Hold on till you get your price.’ ”
The Big Businessman is more or less
a modern phenomenon. He has a large
office, a large cigar and a large waist-
line ; seven desk telephones, a pretty
typist, two secretaries, a private line to
the Stock Exchange and a grudge against
trades unions.
These are the essentials common to
all the species, but in details they differ
widely. Their interests may lie in jute,
oil, whisky, dolls’ eyes, fishing tackle or
paper pulp. In literature their taste may
range from Omar to Ella Wheeler Wil-
cox (with, of course, a predilection for
prospectuses, promissory-notes and sole-
rights contracts); their taste in food may
be for pigs’ trotters or kosher bread ;
their recreation golf or beggar-my-neigh-
bor; but these are all mere trifles that
can be cast aside when they meet on
common ground in the conference-room.
Big Businessmen develop from small
beginnings. The office-boy of to-day is
the 8.8. M. of to-morrow. A Napoleon
of finance once said that every office-
boy carries a manager’s desk in his
pocket. This is probably true, but most
of the lads’ pockets are so cluttered up
with other trifles that they can’t find the
desk when it is wanted. Those that can
become 8.8. M.
In ordinary business you buy things
and sell them again. In Big Business it
isn’t as simple as that. You buy things
and don’t sell them. Or, rather, you
don’t even buy them. You just get the
people who own them to promise not
to sell them to someone else. Then you
just sit down and wait for that someone
else to offer you your price. Then you
let the first lot of people sell to the
second lot and you pocket the difference.
It is delightfully simple.
Sometimes the second lot of people,
or even the first lot, may have a 8.8. M.
among them. This makes the game more
interesting, and provides employment for
the telephones, typists, private lines and
secretaries, as cigars are ordered and
conferences arranged in the luxurious
rooms of the parties.
A glance at a typical conference may
be illuminating. Around a polished table
in a panelled boardroom sit a group of
8.8. M. with bulging waistcoats begirt
with gold watchchains, their podgy
fingers gleaming with diamond rings.
’Phones ring at intervals, and a ticker-
tape ticktacks. On the table are maps
of distant oilfields, platinum mines or
coffee plantations. A particularly fat
man mumbles a few words, stabs a
map with his cigar and gesticulates
wildly. The others nod their assent.
Next day the Shah of Persia feels his
throne toppling or there is a minor re-
volution in Ecuador, and petrol is up
twopence a gallon or there is an ounce
more chicory to the pound of coffee.
In either case the cigars are bigger
than ever.
JASBY.
POSTERITY’S RETORT.
Our ancestors seldom knew quiet;
Their lives were half banquet, half riot;
And, though they had merit,
The ills WE inherit
Convict them of errors of diet!

Information Sought.
A daily newspaper recently reported that
Jack Dempsey was coming to Australia. Is
he likely to visit us, and what is he now doing
in America ? —4266.
. Nothing authentic about Dempsey visiting
Australia has yet been heard, and his many
American interests would probably prevent
him from coming here. Dempsey is in great
demand as a referee (of boxing contests and
wrestling matches) all over the U.S.A., and he
is president of Jack Dempsey, Incorporated,
which rivals Madison-square Garden, Inc., as
a promoter of boxing. He is also the
nominal editor of “Jack Dempsey’s Fight
Magazine.”
Method of dyeing Japanese gut fishing lines
red, and is the method applicable to used lines
as well as to new ?—3831.
Wash the line well in warm weak soap-and-
water solution, rinse thoroughly in clean water
and place in an alcoholic solution of aniline
red. Used lines may be treated in the same
way, provided salt is removed by soaking in
fresh water before treating. Dye may be
obtained from Abel Lemon and Co., 94-96
Harrington-street; or Robert Bryce and Co., 414
Kent-street —both Sydney.
What is the record number of sheep shorn
by one man in one day? —4ol4..
With machines at Bundooran, Queensland,
Dan Cooper shore 316 sheep in one day in
1910. Jack Howe, on July 17, 1904, shore
337 with the blades in eight hours, his previous
record being 321, also with blades, at Alice
Downs, in the Blackall district, Queensland.
In those days the sheep were lighter-woolled
and not covered on the points so well as they
are to-day.
Is it a fact that during the Commonwealth
in England and Scotland adultery was a capital
offence ? —4182.
An Act for the “Reformation of Manners”
introduced in the last days of the Long Parlia-
ment was carried into effect by Cromwell, who
made adultery a capital offence. Juries, how-
ever, steadily refused to convict, and it is
doubtful whether punishment under this Act
(1650) by death was ever actually inflicted. Of
Scotland, it is recorded that in remote times
adultery was punished by death. In England,
under monarchical rule, the offence was not
dealt with by the temporal courts, but was left
for ecclesiastical penance and penalty.
What and when was the first coin made in
Australia ? —4067.
The first coins made in Australia were the
“Holey Dollar” and the “Dump.” Governor
Macquarie in 1813 had a circular piece the
size of a shilling cut out of the centre of the
Spanish dollar. The flat ring remaining was
issued as five shillings, and the piece cut out
was issued at fifteen pence.
Which Minister of Education removed the
disabilities under which children attending
N.S.W. church schools were debarred from
using the departmental coaches in the back
country and compelled to pay train fares, while
those attending State schools were carried free ?
—3946.
Arthur Griffiths, Minister for Education,
intimated to his department in 1915 that Cabinet
had decided that in the case of subsidised con-
veyances children attending other than State
schools were to be conveyed at the expense of
the department, but were to be set down at
the particular State school to which the vehicle
was plying, the balance of the journey to be
completed in a manner to be arranged by the
individual pupils. Children are conveyed no
longer to other than State schools, and the
concession announced by Mr. Griffith applied
only to conveyance contracts which no longer
exist.
Is it possible to buy yearly tickets for all
railway lines in the Commonwealth ? If so,
the cost ?. If not, what is the next best, and
at what cost ? —3995.
An all-lines yearly ticket covering all the
railway systems of Australia is not available.
Separate first-class all-lines yearly tickets may
be obtained for each of the various State
railway systems at the following prices: Queens-
land, £137 65.; New South Wales, £170; Vic-
toria, £100; South Australia, £95; Western
Australia, £125; Tasmania, £55. No all-lines
yearly ticket is available over the lines of the
Commonwealth railway system.
Is it possible for aeroplanes to be struck by
lightning ? —4229.
Question cannot be answered definitely be-
cause if they are struck there are no survivors.
According to the National Advisory Committee
for Aeronautics (U.S.A.), lightning is considered
to be not directly dangerous to aircraft in
flight, but, at the same time, thunderstorms
should be avoided owing to the violent winds
which exist in their vicinity and which are most
dangerous.
A railway truck containing bags of coal
weighing, say, 10 tons is placed bn a weigh-
bridge, but it is only possible for the weigh-
bridge to take one end of the truck at a time.
If the two weighings are added together would
the result be the same as the weight which
would be recorded if the truck were put on a
sufficiently large weighbridge ? —4068.
Substantially the same, provided the
approaches to the weighbridge are level and
care is taken to ensure that the wheels of the
waggon or truck are brought as near as
possible to the middle of the instrument.
What is meant by “magnetic pole,” and
where is it located relative to the geographic
pole ? —3975.
The two ends of a steel magnet are referred
to as the north and south poles respectively,
the magnetic lines of force entering the magnet
at its south pole and leaving at its north pole.
The earth, being a huge magnet, has similar
poles. The north magnetic pole is located at
long. 97 degrees W. and lat. 70 degrees 30
minutes N., and the south magnetic pole,
according to Shackleton, at long. 155 degrees
16 minutes E. and lat. 72 degrees 25 minutes S.
These magnetic poles move from time to time
over considerable areas.
Where can I find information concerning the
cult of the “Golden Goat,” referred to by
Donn Byrne in his novel of that title ? —4097.
These field cults are survivals from prehistoric
times, dramatising the “spirit” of the grain;
first as the Sun God; then as the later symbol
of fertility, the goat. (“Tragedy” derives from
the Greek words tragos, a goat, and ode, a
song.) For the long history of the many and
varied cults consult Frazer’s “Golden Bough”—
particularly the volumes devoted to “Spirits
of the Corn and of the Wild,” and “The Scape-
goat.”
What is a praying wheel ? —4288.
An instrument for offering prayers by
mechanical means, used -exclusively by the
Lamaist Buddhists on the assumption that
the efficacy of prayer consists in the frequency
of its repetition. The instruments are of various
shapes and sizes, from small cylinders turned
by hand to big ones driven by water or wind.
Long strips of paper with a written or printed
formula which translated reads “The Jewel
in the Lotus, Amen,” repeated hundreds or even
thousands of times, are wrapped round these
cylinders, and as they revolve the paper rolls
uncoil, and so the prayer is reckoned to be
said.
Where can 1 get information about Lola
Montez, who lived in Australia during the early
days of gold-mining ? —3961.
There is a book devoted wholly to her life
entitled “Lola Montez: An Adventuress of
the ’Forties,” by E. B. d’Auvergne. It was pub-
lished in, London by Werner Laurie a good
many years ago, and is most likely out of print.
She was born in 1818 and died in 1861. She
arrived in Australia in 1855 and first appeared
in the Victoria Theatre, Sydney, on August 23.
In September she went to Melbourne and then
to Geelong. She seems to have left Australia
in March or April, 1856. .
(1) Has G. B. Shaw written any one-act
plays ? (2) If so, which of them are the most
suitable for production by an amateur
dramatic society ? (3) Where can copies be
obtained in Sydney ? —4130.
Shaw’s one-act pieces are scattered throughout
his volumes of plays, and include “How He
Lied to Her Husband,” and his Napoleonic
comedy “The Man of Destiny,” both suit-
able for your purpose. (2) The best volume
for you is. “Translations and Tomfooleries”
(Constable, 1926), mainly short farces. The
above comedies are not included in it. (3)
Any of the larger bookshops.
(1) Precautions to be taken in and out of
doors during thunderstorms in order to avoid
being struck by lightningJ? (2) Treatment after
shock ? —4109.
(1) Avoid standing under electric and tele-
phone wires, trees, especially isolated ones, and
other tall objects. Buildings may be protected
by lightning rods. Outdoor wireless aerials
should be provided with lightning arresters and
earth switch. (2) The patient should be well
covered and as soon as possible placed in bed
in which hot waterbottles have been put. If
the breathing is suspended or feeble, apply
artificial respiration. Medical aid should be
sought immediately.
Where are the Meibomian glands situated,
and what purpose do they serve ?— 4169.
They are situated on the external margin of
the eyelid, just behind the roots of the lashes.
Their function is to secrete a special lubricating
fluid that prevents injury from self-contact; to
some extent it controls the backward flow of
tears to the tear ducts.
(1) Diet for “weeping” eczema ? (2) General
treatment principles ? (3) How long should
it take for the ill-effects of unsuitable diet to
wear out or leave one’s system ? (4) Is the
complaint curable if (a) chronic, and (b)
about a month old ?— 4lBO.
(1) Alcohol and all spiced and seasoned
dishes must be avoided; foods should be bland
and non-heating. Milk and its derivatives,
junket, boiled fish, green vegetables and fruits,
and white meats are permissible; curtail
starchy foods and sugar in any form. (2), (3)
and (4) Can only be answered after personal
examination by a doctor, save that it may be
said that a cure is possible at all stages.
A cure, if any, for varicose veins in one of
my legs ? —4143.
In the early stages a liniment of potassium
iodide with soap may be smeared on daily
for reduction; physical extremes and long
standing must be avoided meanwhile. A
doctor may prescribe the injection treatment
with quinine and urethane. This may be done
at a public hospital; you attend as an out-
patient, and otherwise continue your normal
routine. Wear a light crepe bandage for
support, but avoid restriction of circulation
in binding the part.
I suffer from absent-mindedness. Can any-
thing be done about it? —4011.
Various systems have been evolved, based
on association of ideas, names, numbers, etc.,
but in adult maturity results are seldom as
desired. Mental training and concentration as
a whole demand the attention of an expert.
(1) Process of manufacture of writing ink ?
(2) Marketing possibilities in Australia ? (3)
Approximate cost of plant ? (4) Requirements
as to registration, etc. ? —4178.
(1) There are literally thousands of formulas,
involving the use of metals, tree galls and
aniline colors. This is a blue-black ink of good
quality: 4£oz. blue Aleppo galls, 1 drachm
bruised cloves, 40oz. cold water, Hoz. purified
sulphate of iron, 35 minims pure sulphuric
acid by measure, loz. paste-form neutral sul-
phate of indigo; all weights are avoirdupois,
all measures apothecaries’. Place the bruised
galls and bruised cloves in a 50oz. bottle,
pour on the water, and allow to digest for a
fortnight with a daily shaking. Filter
thoroughly into another 50oz. bottle, put in
the iron, dissolve, and filter through paper.
Then add the acid and agitate briskly. Lastly,
add the indigo and thoroughly mix by shaking.
Pass the whole through paper; filter from one
bottle to another until the operation is com-
pleted. Then bottle. On a large scale, this
ink is made by percolation. (2) Probably very
poor. There are many good inks on the
market, and all are cheap. Government con-
tracts are profitable but not easy to secure,
as competition is severe. (3) Impossible to
say without going into the question of quantity
to be made: you would require a building, with
vats, measures, mixing and agitating gear, also
transport for collecting materials and distribut-
ing the finished product. (4) Nothing except
the registration of a trade name or brand for
your own protection.
Please give me particulars concerning the
mistletoe that hangs from trees in Australia ?
What is itl How is it caused ? —3764.
The mistletoe is a parasitic plant which
probably at one stage in its evolution was of
climbing habit, but later dispensed with. that
mode of growth and developed the habit of
subsisting upon other plants, without its roots
having any connection with the soil. It
fastens itself upon its host by means of
sucking roots, and draws nourishment from it,
securing from its host apparently only what
a normal shrubby plant derives from the soil,
namely, water and certain mineral constituents.
(1) Size of the planet Saturn as compared
with that of the earth ? (2) Length of a year in
Saturn ? (3) Particulars of the ring surround-
ing that planet ? (4) By whom was it dis-
covered ? —4279.
(1) Saturn is about 725 times larger in
volume, although only about 95 times greater
in mass. (2) 10,759.219 terrestrial days. (3)
The ring is distinctly separable into three parts;
the two outermost are bright like the planet
itself, while the innermost, called the “Dusky”
or “Crepe” ring, is only discernible through
a powerful telescope. The rings are composed
of a multitude of small satellites in rapid
revolution round the planet. The visibility of
the rings when seen end-on proves them to be
very thin, probably about 50 miles thick. The
diameter of the outer ring is 176,000 miles.

of the telescope.
(1) Method of staining and polishing leather;
also how to “finish off” the cut edges? (2)
Where are leather embossing tools procurable ?
—3588.
(1) Leather is stained with solution of dyes
containing about loz. of dye per gallon. Pig-
ment mixtures are also used with the dye.
These coloring matters are put on the leather
with a brush. The same solutions are used
to color the edges. Leather is polished with
various mixtures of starch, wax and albumen.
Pressure is required on the surface after the
application of the starch solutions. (2) Johnson
and Sons, Castlereagh-street, can supply boot-
makers’ and saddlers’ polishing tools. This
work is done by special machines.
I want to tan a couple of kangaroo-skins.
(1) How long should I boil the bark ? (2) How
long does the process of soaking take ? (3) Is
it necessary to peg the skin out to dry, once
tanned ? —3899.
(1) The bark should not be boiled. Soak
well-ground bark in water for 24 to 48 hours,
then run off and put more water on the bark.
Use cold water and break the bark to small
particles. (2) Soak your skin in a salt solution
(31b. salt to lOgal. water) after washing it
to remove all blood and dirt. As soon as the
skin is soft, scrape off all the flesh. The time
for soaking varies from 24 to 48 hours. (3)
Yes, but not tightly. After tanning and before
it is dry apply a coat of oil.
A simple recipe for potpourri? —39Bl.
You will need a large jar with a lid, like
the Chinese plum-blossom jars. Roses are
the base of the mixture, but you may add
lavender, rosemary flowers and leaves, or any
sweet-scented balm, “Old Man” or similar
favorites from old gardens. Gather the rose
petals when they are fully opened, and dry in
the sunshine. Then spread them on paper in
a shady place and let them become withered.
Make up a mixture of powdered cloves, cinna-
mon, a little orris-root powder and a very
little grated nutmeg; store the petals in a
covered jar, and every time you add petals
to the jar sprinkle a layer of the spices over
the roses. As the large jar fills, an occasional
drop of oil of lavender or oil of rose geranium
can be added. Keep the lid on, and remove
it only when you wish to perfume the room.
(1) Method of preserving snakeskins before
tanning ? (2) Simple method of tanning ? (3)
What Vic. firm buys snakeskins, and should
they be sent tanned or untanned ? (4) Approxi-
mate prices paid for brown and black skins ?
—3836.
(1) Nail out on boards and dry in the shade.
(2) The skins are soaked in clean water for 24
hours. If water becomes dirty renew with
clean, also scrape flesh off the skins. Make up
a lime liquor by adding 31b. to 51b. of lime
per lOgal. of water. If the lime is good, 31b.
will be sufficient. Agitate the lime liquor and
place the skins in it before the undissolved lime
settles. Lift the skins out to drain and place
them back twice each day. The scales should
be removed with a scraper at the end of 6 days.
Tanners remove hair from hides and skins with
sodium sulphide. A useful formula is lib. of
lime and £lb. of sodium sulphide per lOgal.
of water. This solution will take the hair off
skins after one to two days’ exposure. The skins
are well washed after removing the scales
before they go to the tan liquors. The volume
of lime liquor used should be sufficient to
cover the skins. Pickle in salt solution con-
taining lib. salt per gallon. Use enough of
this solution to cover the skin, then add loz.
of sulphuric acid to every 81b. of well-drained
skin. Leave overnight. Tan with formalde-
hyde, using a liquor containing 31b. salt per
lOgal. and |oz. of formalin per lb. of wet,
drained skin. The skins now have an acid
reaction, and they are neutralised and made
slightly alkaline by adding to the formalin bath
2\oz. of sodium bicarbonate per loz. of sul-
phuric acid used in the pickle. Leave in this
solution two days. Wash skins from formalin
bath and lay flat on a table. Coat with a small
amount of a mixture of equal parts of water
and sulphonated neatsfoot oil. Allow skins
to dry. If skins are greasy when dry, dip them
in petrol or wash with a little soap and again
dry. Soften by stretching and finish by ironing.

No matter whether you suffer the
“slight” inconvenience of the first
symptoms of Indigestion (Heartburn,
Wind, Palpitation), or the more painful
and dangerous Gastritis, Dyspepsia,
Colitis, Ulcerated Stomach or Bowels
—you can get relief. Relief immediate
and progressive. Not through harmful
and deadening drugs, but by common-
sense and modem principles. DeWitt’s
Antacid Powder acts in a three-fold way.
Firstly, it neutralises the excess acid
which the stomach continually produces,
and allays the irritation.
Secondly, the ulcers are coated with
a film of colloidal-kaolin. So finely
powdered is this kaolin, that it is easily
spread over the entire surface of the
stomach. This protects the inflamed
tissues from the hot, burning acids.
Thirdly, it actually digests portions
of your food, thereby still further taking
the load off the weakened stomach, and
finally, the ingredients in De Witt’s
Antacid Powder so assist Nature to
build up an alkaline reserve in the body,
that, with ordinary care, there will be
no recurrence of your trouble
Take De Witt’s Antacid Powder
regularly, as directed, and you will get
rid of your digestive troubles for good.

FROM CHINA TO PERU.
“Lugger’s Mate”: There weren’t more
than two or three Japs in the Australian
pearl trade prior to 1890, although white
owners and crews were operating as
early as 1859. Licenses were not de-
manded until ’BO or ’Bl. But in 1892 a
crew of Japanese trepangers won a first
prize in Tatt.’s (£10,000). That, with
the growing fame of the pearl beds in
the Orient, brought the little fellows from
Nippon scrambling.

“Cold Stengah”: On Kampong Lal-
ang rubber estate, in Ulu Mabok,
I was overtaken by darkness while
returning from the jungle. Walking
along a narrow path I could smell tiger.
Then, right in front of me, I saw the
shining eyes of the great cat. I let drive
vith both barrels—and the two fireflies
fitted away in opposite directions.

“Endeavour”: Escapees used to be
among the principal exports from New
Caledonia. They only had to get about
eight miles north of N.C. in any sort
of boat and they were safe. An ocean
current would bring them straight to
Cooktown. In 1897 a party of three
made a double escape. They got away
from Noumea, and they escaped from
Cooktown gaol—any determined man
could open the old structure with a pair
of scissors. The usual haunts of
escapees were combed in vain. But they
turned up in the end —hidden in the
police barracks yard.

Arthur Meighan, who represents
Canada at Melbourne’s centenary cele-
brations, had two short terms as Prime
Minister—a year in 1920-21 and two
months in 1926 ; then he lost his seat
and retired from politics for six years.
In 1932, he was elected to the Senate,
which he leads as Minister without port-
folio. Farm-bred, Meighan graduated
at Toronto University with honors in
mathematics, went into commerce,
studied for the Bar and became a K.C.
with a sound commercial practice. His
somewhat austere manner with electors
made seats difficult for him to hold.

Joges Chandra Chaudari, Vice-Presi-
dent of the Indian Legislative Assembly,
in Melbourne for the centenary, is an
unusual type of politician. Calcutta
University educated him, New College,
Oxford, polished him, and a call to the
London Bar helped further to prepare
him for his first big job—Lecturer in
Chemistry and Physics at an Indian Col-
lege. Later he became editor of a Cal-
cutta weekly paper and a member of
the Bengal Council. He was first elected
to the Assembly in ’2l. He married the
daughter of the late Surendranath Ban-
nerjea, editor of the “Bengalee,” Profes-
sor of English Literature at Ripon Col-
lege, Calcutta, and founder of the Indian
National movement.

“El V.”: It’s kind of “Pardon Me” (B.
7/11/ ’34) to correct me about Dr. John-
son and the Cheshire Cheese. I know
all about both Jay and Redding—the
former wrote 83 years after the Doctor
died, and the latter at least a generation
after the sage is supposed to have occu-
pied his favorite chair. I know an old
Judge in England who has made a study
of the subject, and his verdict is dead
against the Cheese —a landmark which
Boswell would scarcely have missed and
contemporary literature would never
have overpassed. The proprietors of the
day would have seen to that. When in
London, I asked for evidence, but it was
of the vaguest and most traditional kind.

“E.H.M.”: Mrs. Thompson was not
the last lady executed in England (B.
31/10/’34) ; . that distinction belongs to
a Lancashire lass, Louie Harcourt,
hanged at Strangeways Gaol, Manchester,
in ’26. After some trouble with her land-
lady, she strangled that person with a
stocking, pinched some of her possessions
and pawned them. The subsequent pro-
ceedings were so unsensational, there
being no sex interest to engage flapper-
press attention, that the public did not
worry about her fate till a few days be-
fore her death. The governor of the gaol
told me that she seemed a “nice little
woman, rather glad to get out of it all.”
He mentioned that one of her male rela-
tives had cursed him, adding, “Poor
fellow, he little knows what waste of
breath these comminations are.” But,
perhaps, the cursee knows better now.
Anyway, a few weeks afterwards he was
killed in a motor accident. Mrs. Thomp-
son’s case, too, was nearly followed by an-
other tragedy—her executioner tried to
execute himself.

“V.S.”: Five years ago Fred Perry
was known only in ping-pong circles. At
least two of his strokes, he says himself,
were transferred from the table to the
lawn—the backhand drive played on the
forehand and the forehand drive taken
early from the extreme right-hand corner
of the court. Now he is the first English-
man to win the American championship
twice, and he is the only player to win
the championships of Australia, England
and the U.S.A. in the same season.

“Centre Court”: Though he hasn’t
ventured abroad this year, Austin, the
English Davis Cup player, is cutting a
wide swathe in the covered courts cham-
pionships which rage in Europe about
this time. In England the flappers’ idol
beat a strong field in the go for the Eng-
lish title, among them being Prenn, the
shape of whose nose changed him in a
night from a German to a Pole, and who,
whatever Hitler and his Nordics may
think, is one of the best singles players
in tennis. In the final Austin had a hard
gallop with gallant old Borotra, winning
by three sets to two.

“Spike”: The theory that international
sporting visits improve the comity of
nations suffered another knock when
complaints as to food and lack of train-
ing conveniences came thick from
the Dominions athletes at the Empire
Games in London. An unexpected
revelation is that the programme was
drawn up by the directors of the White
City, who guaranteed expenses. In other
words speculators ran the show, which
comes perilously close to professionalism.

OVER TEST COURSE.
GOOD TOP-GEAR PULLING AND ACCELERATION
OUTSTANDING FEATURES.
BY FRED BERRY.
A LTHOUGH the splendid reputation for speed and reliability
established by Vauxhall in Australia has been made with
cars of heavy and powerful types, yet the new 14-h.p. Light
Six, tested recently over “The Bulletin” course, is a true Vauxhall
in every respect and fully worthy of the name it bears. Further-
more, this new model gives motorists something fully
appreciated in these troublesome days— extreme economy in
operation without the slightest sacrifice of roadworthiness,
comfort, reliability or appearance.
As a general rule, motorists in this
country seeking low fuel consumption
in the quest for economy had in past
years to be content with a very modest
top-gear performance, and cars of this
type demanded continuous gear changes
if a decent average speed was attempted
over not-too-good highways.
With the new 14-h.p. Vauxhall, how-
ever, despite the low-rated horse-power
The 14-h.p. Light Six Vauxhall coupe.
of the engine, a touring speed of 50
m.p.h. can be held on normal main roads,
while top-gear climbing is an outstand-
ing feature of this sturdy little outfit.
So far as owner-driver service is con-
cerned, the car satisfies. The designer
has kept an eye on accessibility and
repairs or overhauls may easily be con-
ducted without the use of special tools,
Although wheelbase is but lOlin. and
track 4ft. 2in., the sedan body gives
ample leg room ; the seat in the driver’s
compartment is of generous width, and
as provision is made for adjustment of
the front seat passengers at rear are
assured of reasonable comfort,
Steering is rather high-geared—an
advantage in this type of car—and as a
consequence cornering at high speed is
delightfully easy and safe. Bodywork,
upholstery and fittings are very good for
a machine in this price group.
The 6-cyl. engine is fitted with over-
head valves operated by push rods from
a camshaft in the crankcase. Bore, 2.42
inches, and stroke, 3.93 inches, give a
piston displacement of 108.8 cub. in.
(1782.8c.c.), and, though the R.A.C. rating
is but 14.07 horse-power, the maximum
output at 3500 r.p.m. is 42 b.h.p.
Cylinders are cast en bloc and integral
with upper half of
the crankcase, there-
by ensuring maxi-
mum rigidity, and,
as the power unit is
suspended in the
chassis at three
points on live rub-
ber supports, vibra-
tion throughout the
complete speed
range is for all prac-
tical purposes elimi-
nat e d. Torsional
vibration is absorb-
ed by a clutch-type
damper on the front
end of the crank-
shaft. Pistons are
aluminium alloy,
split-skirt type, each
having three rings positioned above the
gudgeon. Detachable cylinder head is
used, the combustion chamber being of
special non-detonating type, so that a
compression ratio of 5.5 to 1 is used with-
out fear of pinking even when operating
on low-grade fuels.
Lubrication is by pressure to main, big-
end, small-end, camshaft bearings and
overhead rocker gear, while, to assure an
ample supply of oil to pistons and
cylinder walls, a hole is drilled through
the top half of each big-end bearing and
connecting rod at an angle from the
vertical centre line of the rods, so that
a jet of oil is sprayed into each cylinder
bore at every revolution of the crank-
shaft. An oil pump of gear type is sub-
merged in the crankcase and driven from
the camshaft, a large oil strainer being
built into the sump. As a further safe-
guard an A.C. cartridge-type oil filter is
located in the pipeline and mounted on
the induction manifold.
The fuel tank, capacity nine gallons, is
mounted at the rear of the chassis. A
mechanical pump driven from an
eccentric on the camshaft feeds the petrol
to latest type Zenith down-draught car-
burettor, on which throttle control and
air strangler are interconnected, assur-
ing easy starting under all conditions. An
automatic air valve on the strangler flap
prevents overchoking when starting
from cold, and an air filter of generous
dimensions prevents dust and other
foreign matter from entering the induc-
tion system.
The cooling system is controlled
thermostatically, a combined impellor
and fan in the circuit being driven on the
“triangle principle,” together with the
generator, from a pulley on the crank-
shaft. Coil-and-battery ignition is em-
ployed, with full automatic spark
advance.
Lucas lighting and starting equipment
is fitted, the dynamo being a “three-
charge rate” type, controlled from the
instrument panel, high-charge rate cutting
in automatically whenever the headlights
are' switched on.
Transmission is through a single-plate
dry clutch to a four-speed-and-reverse
gearbox with central ball change lever.
Top and third gears are silent synchro-
mesh type, using helical-cut pinions.
Final drive is through a tubular propeller
shaft, with metal Hardy-Spicer universal
joints fore and aft, to a semi-floating
rear axle mounted in a banjo-type hous-
ing. Final ratio is 4.77 to 1.
Braking equipment is mechanically
operated, semi-servo type,- on all four
wheels. The handbrake operates through
an independent linkage to the cross shaft,
the same shoes being used for both
systems.
Steering is worm-and-sector type, ball
joints being fitted to the track rod and
Cutaway section of mechanical fuel pump
and filter, showing method of operation.
drag link, while provision is made for
adjusting end play due to wear in both
sector shaft and columns as well as in
the meshing of worm-and-sector gear.
The chassis is of channel-section pressed
steel, with four pressed-steel cross-
members.
The dashboard instruments are neatly
grouped in a central panel and include
choke control, oil gauge, clock, ammeter,
ignition warning lamp, speedometer,
fuel gauge, panel lighting switch, inspec-
tion lamp adaptor, ignition switch and
light switch control.

cwt., an indication of robust construction
and generous weight of metal in all essen-
tial details. Speedometer reading stood
at 8500 miles, but except for slight tyre
wear it was impossible to detect any
variation for either new-car appearance
or performance, the motor being ex-
tremely quiet'.
Driving through the busy city traffic
one was immediately impressed by the
splendid acceleration. As is to be ex-
pected, by reason of short wheelbase and
track, the car steers easily, yet
the outfit gives driver and passengers a
big-car impression.
Passing through Parramatta and on the
open country road the speedometer
needle settled between 45 and 50 with
but a small throttle opening, and one
felt that this gait could be maintained
indefinitely over reasonably graded roads.
Approaching Windsor speed was re-
duced to 15 m.p.h., and with the gear
lever in neutral the car coasted 690 yards
before coming to rest, indicating correct
alignment and perfect freedom of ail
transmission details.
Over a measured mile with flying start
maximum speed was then determined,
and here the clock showed 56 seconds, an
average of 64.3 m.p.h. During this test
the car steered easily and definitely and
held the road well.
Continuing through Richmond and
approaching Kurrajong Mountain, the
turn-off through Grose Vale was taken
over an unmade dirt road, and on this
difficult section the Vauxhall acquitted
itself admirably, handiness on acute bends
being an outstanding feature.

Something attempted
and something done . . ,
A whistle blows the end of a Holden day ... the song of
steel ceases . . . machines forsake their rhythm , .
and 3,400 men and women are homeward bound. In the
delivery department, though, are long lines of Holden
bodies—one day’s production by the Woodville, South
Australia plant which covers 40 acres, and represents an
investment of over £1,500,000. Each of these bodies
has, in the course of its production, passed through 20
departments and has received no less than 1,213 progress
checks on its quality.
“Body by Holden”—how much those three words
signify. They describe the product of a vast secondary
industry of which Australians can well be proud. They
describe too, a refinement in motoring comfort- and
ownership which thanks to Holden enterprise such
a big percentage of Australian motorists enjoy to-day.

was then made —elapsed time, 4 minutes
12 seconds. While very good for so low-
powered a motor, this would have been
improved with a higher second- or lower
third-gear ratio. So far as road-holding
was concerned no fault could be found,
while steering was easy and safe on even
the most difficult bends. Returning down
the mountain a test was made of the
emergency braking equipment from a
speed of 15 m.p.h. with satisfactory
results.
Approaching Richmond the cross-
country road via Castlereagh to Penrith
was taken, and here further performance

tests were conducted. The first, that' of
covering 1-5 mile as slowly as possible
in top gear, followed immediately by a
similar distance on full throttle, still in
top, is an extremely exacting test, but
one serving to show at a glance the
flexibility of the motor and the top-gear
possibilities of the car under test. On
the slow-running section the time taken
was 2 minutes 40 seconds, averaging
4.5 m.p.h., a figure which could have
been bettered by more careful tuning of
the idling control. On the fast section
the Vauxhall showed splendid accelera-
tion, clocking 24 seconds for the distance,
an average of 30 m.p.h. The finishing
line was crossed at almost 50 m.p.h.
Acceleration in top, third and second
gears from 10 to 30 m.p.h. was next
timed, and here again creditable figures
were established: top gear, 9 3-5 seconds ;
third, 7 3-5; and second, 5 4-5, together
with a standing start to 50 m.p.h. time of
24 seconds clearly indicating the excel-
lent traffic qualities of this sturdy little
car.
Next test involved measuring the
efficiency of the servo braking equipment.
The Vauxhall stopped without swerving
in 20ft'. from a speed of 25 m.p.h., an
excellent result. Time taken for the 117
miles’ journey was 3hr. 28min., giving
an average speed, inclusive of all tests,
of 33£ m.p.h. Petrol used, 3| gallons,
gave a consumption of 31.2 m.p.g., a dual
performance which must be of great
interest to motorists seeking economy
without sacrificing average speed or rid-
ing comfort.
Motor Oddities.
“Grease-spot”: The biggest motoring
thrill I ever got was as a passenger in a
motor-bike sidecar. We were booming
down a Brisbane street and wondering
why a cop didn’t stop us for fast driv-
ing, when a girl fell off a tram directly
ahead. I had a split-second vision of
the girl lying prone on the road in front
of me. Next thing I knew I was heaved
skyward, held between heaven and earth
for a breezy moment, then bumped
down to a level position again. My
cobber had tilted over and raised the
sidecar wheel well off the ground, so
that we passed harmlessly over the girl,
thus avoiding complications to an already
nasty accident.
* * * *
“Big End”: Three Adelaide students
made a bold bid for any prize that may
be offering for the cheapest motor holi-
day. They bought an old Model T Ford
for a fiver, the ’bus being in going order
except for loose big-end bearings. These
they packed with leather, and set off for
Mt. Gambier, which they reached safely.
On the return journey, a series of sicken-
ing crashes brought Lizzie to a standstill.
One of the connecting-rods had torn
loose from the crankshaft and had been
driven through the sump. The sump
was patched with sheet-iron, the damaged
rod and piston were taken out, and the
journey back to Adelaide made on three
cylinders. A dealer in motor junk gave
them £5 for the remains, so they had the
jaunt for the cost of petrol and oil. I
don’t think they bothered about a license.
jJc
“D.C.R.”: About 1903 my family im-
ported a 4-cyl. Leader car, short in the
wheelbase, high in the stern and down
by the bows. Admittance to the tonneau
was through a nar-
row door at the
rear, and once in-
side one had a dress-
circle seat, with a
bird’s-eye view in all
directions. Our next
car was a Schacht
motor-buggy. It had
solid rubber tyres,
but the wheels ran
on Timken rollers.
The engine was at
the rear, and drove
through a friction
disc to a differential
arrangement con-
tained in a long
barrel amidships, thence by chain back
again to the back wheels. The hori-
zontally opposed twin cylinders had a
10-h.p. punch in each, so a kick-back
in starting was not to be lightly re-
garded. Owing to the short wheelbase
and the weight being carried so high,
cornering called for skill and discretion,
but fortunately the maximum speed was
not terrific. Owners of these buggies
were probably bad marks for insurance
companies, and I remember that the hair
of the man who bought ours almost
immediately turned white.
Hints for Amateur Mechanics.
Engine tune depends upon correct
valve adjustment. Two thin fixed
spanners must be used. First slack
off lock-nut, then adjust tappet head
to give correct clearance (using
feeler gauge). Hold head carefully
in place and turn up lock-nut as
tightly as possible.
The Trouble Lamp.
G.A.F. (Corfield, N.Q.). —My 1927 Reo
truck has recently been fitted with oversize
rings. Compression in all four cylinders is
equal and fair, and spark on all four plugs
is also good. When idling only the two front
cylinders fire, and if these are shorted the
engine stops. On opening the throttle the
motor hits again on all four, but not well on
the back pair. What can be done ?
Probably the cam in the make-and-break
of the distributor is badly worn, allowing the
points to close and open the correct distance

by slowly turning the starting handle with the
distributor cap off. If this is not the trouble,
look for air-leaks in inlet manifold ot the
two rear cylinders.
A.L.J. (Eastwood, N.S.W.). — The 12 -volt
battery in my car will not hold the charge for
more than 24 hours. Remedy ?
There must be either an internal short within
the battery due to sediment or faulty plates, or
a serious short-circuit exists between battery
and switchboard. Specific gravity should be
1.260/1.300 when fully charged.
G. (Rhodes, N.S.W.).— My 1932 9-
h.p. sedan starts to sway from side to side
when running at 35 miles per hour. I have
looked over the steering and find everything
correct. What do you advise ?
Your trouble appears to be a critical case of
wheel-wander. The only certain remedy is
to take the car to a firm specialising in cor-
rection of such matters.
H. (Bowral, N.S.W.). — At 20 m.p.h.
the oil-pressure gauge in my K Model Chev.
reads 2 to 3, going up to 4 at high engine
revs., but dropping to 2 after a long run. This
has been going on for 18 months. Would
heavier oil improve matters ?
The bearings in your engine are slack
through wear, which accounts for relatively
low oil pressure. A crankshaft overhaul and
adjustment of the release valve will rectify
the trouble, while changing to a heavier grade
of oil may or may not improve matters.
As the car is running well, you are passing a
sufficient volume of oil through the bearings
for effective lubrication, so there is no immedi-
ate cause for alarm or worry.
C.W.S. (Coolgarra, N.Q.). — Who are the
agents for Manchester trucks in Sydney, and
are they still being built ?
Cannot trace agency or secure any informa-
tion.
J.D.S. (Strathfield, N.S.W.). — How long can
a normal car with piston rings and cylinders
in good condition hold compression if gas is
left in the cylinders ? Have been told 15
seconds is a fair average, while one driver
who always accelerates before switching off
claims 12 hours. Which of these is correct ?
Any engine in good mechanical condition
should hold sufficient gas in the cylinders to
effect a start with battery ignition for several
hours. The old Model T Fords frequently
kicked over on the switch after a six-hour
spell, while a 1927 model Rolls-Royce (B.
8/8/’34) started up on the dual ignition after
remaining idle in a garage for three days.
J.E.K. (South Broken Hill, N.S.W.). — Far
100 much oil is being used by my 1929 car.
It seems to be blowing out of the flywheel
casing. When standing a lot of oil drips on
the road. Will it be expensive to put this
right ?
Everything points to excessive wear of both
cylinders and crankshaft, and your motor is
due for a more or less serious breakdown
unless given immediate attention. Have the
sump dropped and check bearing and cylinder
wear. The only certain cure is reboring or
relining cylinders and careful adjustment of
main and big-end bearings.
C.S. (Moree, N.S.W.). — I am considering pur-
chasing a second-hand roadster and converting
it into a fast sports car. Would either of the
two cars named be suitable in road-holding
qualities to get 90 m.p.h. by fitting higher gear
ratios, and would I get reasonable pulling
powers in top gear ?
You won’t get 90 m.p.h. You can, of
course, “hot up” a roadster to give higher
maximum speed than standard, but alteration
of gear ratio is only one of many things that
would suggest themselves to an experienced
mechanic. If you do get a higher maximum it
must be at the expense of top-gear pulling and
low-speed pick-up.
L.M. (St. Kilda, Vic.).—(l) Will compulsory
third-party insurance be introduced in Vic. ?
(2) My extra air will not stop the engine when
turned full on. Is this right ? (3) Is it a
bad practice to use the engine as a brake
with ignition switched off ? (4) What approxi-
mately should be the capacity of a battery in
good condition for starting up a Buick Six
engine without being charged meanwhile ? (5)
Where in Melbourne can I get a new key to
fit the door of my Buick sedan ? I have
the serial number.

the Parliaments of both Vic. and N.S.W. at
time of writing. It is already in force in
M.L. (2) Either extra-air hose is partly
blocked, strangling the air supply, or the mix-
ture at the carburettor is much too rich. (3)
It is never a good policy to switch off battery
ignition when running downhill against the
motor. It doesn’t help, and is likely to damage
the silencer when switched on again. (4)
Battery in good condition should turn the
Buick engine continuously for from 10 to 15
minutes, the standard discharge test being
100 amperes for 15 minutes. (5) General

A REGENERATIVE REFLEX ALL-WAVE
SUPERHETERODYNE.
BY DON B. KNOCK.
This receiver is the result of extensive tests made with various valve
combinations and methods of reflexing, and should interest readers who
like to get the most out of few valves. It is a powerful and very satisfac-
tory performer between 200 and 600 metres, and, due to the method of
obtaining regeneration with reflexing, is extremely sensitive over the
short-wave ranges. As presented, it is intended for battery operation, so
a Class-B audio system is incorporated. For A.C. working, a 42 pentode
following the 687, with rectifier, will result in a 3/4 all-wave receiver
with the sensitivity of a nine- or ten-valver, but with extremely low noise-
level. To avoid complication, plug-in coils are used, but switching could
be used alternatively by using a deeper chassis and grouping the coils.
There is something intriguing about'
reflexing. There always has been, from
the days when radio was new to the
public and men talked about crystals
and variometers in the train or tram.
Briefly, reflexing means that a valve is
made to perform a diversity of func-
tions —and it wasn’t so easy in the days
when they were just valves. Now the
story is different. With all kinds of
highly-efficient valves, some with a
variety of elements within the one glass
envelope, many things can be done, and
not the least of these is reflexing.
Applied to the superheterodyne, the
principle has much more interesting
applications than it had in days of yore,
and by careful design very satisfactory
results can be obtained. The reflex
superheterodyne is by no means new.
Manufacturers overseas and in Australia
have produced them in the last year or
so. They have been successful, but they
have invariably been limited to opera-
tion between 200 and 600 metres. The
writer decided to try the possibilities of
reflexing in a superheterodyne of an all-
wave type, and it is admitted that he had
some misgivings about the short-wave
side. Would sensitivity be sufficient
without adding valves in some R.F.
amplification capacity? To determine
this it was decided to make the receiver
with plug-in coils to enable easy com-
parison, and at the same time to keep
things simple for the constructor. As a
performer on the broadcast band no-
thing was lacking, but around 25 or 30
metres there was not quite enough sen-
sitivity. Another I.F. stage or an R.F.
. stage ahead of the autodyne would have
turned this trick, but more valves were
taboo for this job. By the simple ex-
pedient of introducing regeneration in
a novel way the deficiency was overcome.
Over this regenerative reflex superhet,'
which needs only three valves in an R.F.
and audio capacity, the big multi-valve
superhet can show no points. The re-
verse is the case, because the reflex job
wins hands down on signal-over-noise
level. In slang terms, this is a “hot”

receiver and by far the most interesting
to emerge from the writer’s lab.
Explaining the Circuit.
Although, as shown in Fig. 1, four
valves are used, two of these are doing
work in a Class-B audio system. These
are the 37 (or 76) and the 79. This is
because the particular model was made
especially for use in a country location,
with a 6-volt accumulator and 180 volts
of B battery. To do the job for A.C.
operation, all that is necessary is a 42
pentode audio stage after the 687 and
the usual rectifier filter and voltage dis-

Regeneration is effected by the small capacity across the 465kc. R.F. choke.
tribution. Naturally, the 2.5-volt equiva-
lents could be used, the valve arrange-
ment then being 2A7, 287, 2A5 and 80,
but the 6.3-volt series is considered more
efficient. No alterations are necessary
to the heart of the circuit in either case.
The 6A7 Pentagrid converter is, with its
2A7 equivalent, now well known. It is
an electron-coupled detector-oscillator.
The 687 duo-diode detector (and the
287) is also a much-used valve. Here
it is used to perform three functions
Firstly, it operates as R.F. (1.F.) amplifie;
at 465 kc. Secondly, as a diode detector
and, thirdly, as a first audio stage. It
addition to this, by using independen
bias, with the blocking off of the diode
section from the control grid, regenera-
tion is introduced as explained later.
To avoid second-spot tuning effects on
the broadcast range, 465 kc. is chosen. On
the short waves the second spot is there,
but is not at all troublesome, being much
weaker than the correct signal. Para-
mount air-tuned I.F. transformers are
used, and these are strongly recom-
mended owing to the variable primary
and secondary coupling feature—an
advantage for increasing sensitivity on
short waves. The output from the 6A7
at the beat frequency of 465 kc. is fed
into the first I.F.T. in the usual way
and delivered across the control grid and
cathode of the 687, being at earth poten-
tial via the bias resistor. The signal at
I.F. is amplified in the screen-grid por-
tion and the output fed into the primary
of the second I.F.T. The secondary of
this transformer is brought back to feed
the diode plates of the 687 and through
the 500,000-ohm resistor and .00025 mfd.
condenser to the cathode. The audio-
frequency variations are thus impressed
upon the control grid and cathode. The
A.F. signal is then amplified in the usual
way and delivered from the plate and
cathode, to be developed as voltage varia-
tion across the high-impedance choke in
the high-voltage source. From there on
the process is that of audio amplification
purely, the Class-B output driving an
Amplion permag. speaker fitted with the
correct transformer.
Volume Control.
Various methods of volume control
were tried, and, although finally a 10,000-
ohm potentiometer was used in the
cathode of the 6A7, a 500.000-ohm. I.R.C.
potentiometer was tried in the control
grid circuit of the 687 in place of the
fixed resistor there, and proved to be
equally effective. The first-mentioned
method is better because there is no de-
tuning effect and the action is purely
that of volume increase and decrease.
Another way is to use a 50,000-ohm
potentiometer in the screen grid of the
687, but this has the disadvantage of
slight noise in operation, due to the
nature of the circuit.
Regeneration.
This is the important feature of the
receiver, and must be attended to care-
fully. The secondaries of the first and
second I.F. transformers are blocked off
from each other by the .01 mfd. con-
denser and the 465 kc. R.F. choke. This
choke is extremely important, and the
usual slot-wound type is more effective
than the average small honeycomb kind.
If this choke fails to choke, the I.F. will
oscillate continuously, and this state of
affairs cannot be permitted. It was the
fact that an unsuitable choke was first
tried, with resultant oscillation, that led
to the use of this method of regeneration.
By placing a very small capacity across
an effective choke and making this of
such a value that feedback just begins

to take place, the receiver can be used
in an extremely sensitive yet stable con-
dition. Signals on the short waves rise
at once from R 2 to R 8 in the usual way
of expressing signal strength. The con-
denser actually used was a two-plate neu-
traliser from bygone days, but a small
trimmer or padder, screwdriver adjust-
ment type, is ideal. The I.F. transformers
are peaked “on the nose” and this small
capacity adjusted until oscillation just
fails to occur.
High-impedance Choke.
The choke used in the original is an
audio transformer with primary and
secondary connected in series, but there
are special chokes available for this pur-
pose, notably A.W.A. and Lekmek. De-
coupling is provided in this audio feed
circuit by the inclusion of the 10,000-
ohm resistor and .1 mfd. condenser.
Class-B Driver Transformer.
This is one of the Airzone driver
transformers, admirably suited for use
with the 79 Class-B valve. It is of small
size, and fits comfortably underneath the
chassis, as may be seen in Fig. 5.
Coil Specifications.
With the exception of the two coils
for the broadcast band, which are purely
standard, fitted to 5-pin plug-in Marquis
adaptors and screened, the short-wave
coils are wound on Marquis 5-pin ribbed
plug-in formers. The broadcast coils
are standard, and comprise merely an
oscillator (6A7 or 2A7 type) and detector,
with padder for 465 kc. The coils are
mounted in screening cans, and fitted in
such a manner that the 5-pin base projects
from the can. The can is earthed to the
earth pin in each coil. In the case of
the oscillator, the padder is arranged on
the side of the coil can, and is thus part
of the coil unit. Although in the circuit
diagram the padder is not indicated, it
is, of course, in series with the oscillator
grid coil and the tuning condenser C.
There are three pairs of short-wave
coils, as follows:

the coils are marked G, E, etc. The oscil-
lator coils should be visualised as having
the actual windings connected as shown,
No padder is needed on the short waves,
the manual trimmer Cl taking care of
the frequency difference.
Coil-mounting Connections and Tuning
Condensers.
The tuning condenser is an Efco split-
stator twin-gang, with the small stator
in use on the short waves and the two
stators in each section in shunt on broad-
cast. Reference to Fig. 3 will show how
the connections are made. When the

gang nearest the front is the detector section. The two 1F. transformers are
together at the back, with the 6A7 on the left, the 687 on the right-rear, audio
impedance in front, then the driver valve and 79 Class-B valve at the right-front.
The aerial and earth terminals, battery-cable socket, filament switch and speaker
socket are at the back of the chassis. The coil mountings are arranged with the
6A7 between, the rear one being for the oscillator.
broadcast coils are plugged in, the two
stators are connected in parallel by means
of the dotted-line cross connection in
the coils. At the same time, the midget
trimmer condenser Cl in Fig. 1, which
is needed only for the short waves, is
left out of circuit. When the short-wave
coils are plugged in, this condenser comes
into action in the detector section, across
the small stator, and the large stators are
left open. The connections marked EE
in the detector section indicate that the

the top. To avoid confusion in coils, the oscillator coil mount is colored red and the
detector blue, with the tops of the coils colored correspondingly.
two earth ends of the aerial and grid
coils are connected together to the one
pin.
Five-pin valve sockets are used for
the mountings, and they are supported
on small stand-off insulators, Hin. above
the top of the chassis. These sockets
should be good ones, and the Airzone
type is recommended or the more ex-
pensive National. The tuning dial is an
Efco Aero Junior, which is an excellent
control for both broadcast and short
waves.
General Details
The chassis is of aluminium, measur-
ing 12in. by llin. by 2|in., and the actual
layout is shown in the illustrations. The
two Paramount I.F. transformers were
fitted with semicircular coyer plates to
avoid the temptation to inexperienced
hands to meddle with the trimmers and
couplings when once set. This explains
why the holes for the screwdriver adjust-
ments are not visible in Fig. 4. All the
values are indicated in the circuit dia-
gram of Fig. 1, and it will be noticed
that a double-pole switch is used for
the filaments (heaters). One side breaks
the A positive and the other the con-
nection between B negative and earth.
This is a precaution if a volume control
is used in the screen grid of the 687 ;
otherwise there would be a drain on the
B battery with the set switched off. If
the 6A7 cathode volume control is used,
only the one switch in the A positive is
necessary. Underneath the chassis the
manual trimmer condenser Cl and 11-
plate midget are mounted with an exten-
sion control, on a bracket, to place them
directly underneath the detector portion
of the two-gang condenser, and thus to
keep wiring as short as possible. The
procedure in testing the receiver is to
deal with it on the
broadcast range
first. When this
is lined up to sat-
isfacton by the
time- honored
methods, the
short-wave side
can be tried and
regeneration ad-
justed for the best
position. Once
this is done it
should not be
necessary to
touch it again.
As for per-
forma nee, the
writer cannot
speak too highly
of this receiver.
The usual indoor
aerial is ample
for inter - State
broad cast sta-
tions, and such
stations as Daven-
try, Zeesen and
Tokio are heard
with good recep-
tion conditions on the short waves with
ample volume. The main thing in this
respect is the superiority of the receiver
in providing sensitivity but keeping down
the background mush which accompanies
many multi-valve superhets.
If a little sharpness in short-wave
tuning is no objection, the plug-in coil
connections can be simplified by using
an ordinary .00036 mfd. two-gang con-
denser instead of the split-stator. The
latter has the advantage of easier short-
wave tuning and more efficient L/C
ratio. There should be no need to stress
the necessity for soundness in construc-
tion and for wiring as shortly and
directly as possible. If symmetrical lay-
out of the oscillator and detector circuits
is adopted, there should be no trouble in
tracking of tuning. The original is a
very efficient receiver, and there is no
reason why the reader should not obtain
duplication of results.

The tabloid radio newspaper is com-

may be a good market for such a ser-

A DOG AND HIS TAIL.
What I like most about P. A. Grainger
(whose lecture-recitals have proved the
best service the A.B.C. has yet done for
music) is the hearty radicalism of some
of his utterances. In his last Sydney
broadcast, before playing the whole of the
Cyril Scott Sonata, he sat down at the
piano and sang “onetwothreefourfivesix-
seveneight” to show how Cyril mixes,
interrupts and annihilates rhythms. After
that little song with accompaniment he
delivered, out of the blue sky as it were,
this devastating thunderbolt: “A regular
and steady rhythm is like a dog chasing
its own tail; very pleasant, no doubt,
but the continual recurrence of the ex-
pected is monotonous.”
You see the implication. All the
makers of music who came before
Scott and the other members of • the
little contemporary band of eccentric
rhythmists and no-rhythmists are wiped
out like chalk marks on a blackboard
under a wet sponge—Bach with his
fugues that run as steady as a sausage-
1000 / 2000-watt A.W.A. designed and manufactured high-fidelity broadcast
transmitter with crystal control. Displayed in the A.W.A. Hall, Centenary
Exhibition Melbourne.
machine ; Beethoven with his strict-time
rondos ; even Chopin with his polonaises
and valses, despite the rubato, and
Brahms with his solid base of regular
beats, despite his cross rhythms.
Of course Grainger didn’t imply all
that, and his listeners knew he didn’t.
He was just clearing the way for his
friend, but while he trailed Cyril Scott’s
Chinaman through a Javanese jungle
(using a silk handkerchief for the black-
note glissandos), and found him at last
counterpointing in a Tibetan monastery,
some of us went on thinking about that
dog who chased his tail and found it
pleasant. It wasn’t monotonous to the
dog. He did it to avoid monotony, out
of pure gaiety of heart, as a variation
from running, trotting, walking and lying
down. His rhythm in all these matters
except the last, which is of the order of
a pause, is regular. So is the movement
of our solar system (including the proces-
sion of the equinoxes) and the movement
of all the stellar systems to the utter-
most infinites of the universe. Suns and
moons rise and set as regularly as a
sleeping baby breathes, and stars come
out and twinkle, weather permitting,
with the periodical inevitability of gas-
bills and tax-assessments.
And —here I’m with Grainger—there’s
never a soul so dead that it doesn’t some-
times say to itself “By gosh, this eternal
rotation of one damn thing after another
always in the same order is monotonous.
Go to! Let me vary the menu.” So,
that soul goes out and drinks a gallon
of beer, or takes to golf or psychoanalysis,
or, in extreme cases like a Cyril Scott’s
or a Cezanne’s, sets about deliberately to
destroy rhythm and expectedness. Whole
communities sometimes get the same feel-
ing, and then there are wars and revo-
lutions. These are soon perceived to
be rhythmical, too; like golf, the theories
of Freud and the effects of alcohol, and
the generation that follows the one that
was surprised by an unexpected rhythmer
in music, painting or politics says “He
has become monotonous.”
I knew a chap who had both a gramo-
phone and a pianola (this was before the
days of radio), and he got so tired of
their repeating things always in the same
way that he made a reverse-motion motor
for his gramophone and put his piano-
rolls on tail-end first, thereby producing
musical effects which, though demon-
strably as rhythmical as ever, sounded as
if they weren’t. One of the Liszt Rhap-
sodies (I forget which, but it had some
tremendous heavy-chorded chromatic
passages in it) played in this manner per
pianola was capable of scaring small
children almost out of their wits. I have
never known music make a more genu-
ine or more powerful impression. But
my friend grew tired of these invertions.
He sold both the pianola and the gramo-
phone, and took up the violin, his per-
formances on which had such elements
of unexpectedness that they surprised him
more than anyone else. At ttye end, how-
ever, he decided to stick to business. He
was in jute, and if there is any ascertain-
able rhythm about the jute market 19
generations of merchants have been un-
able to discover it.
I’m prepared to agree with Grainger
that one can have too much rhythm in
music. After study of a vast assortment
of broadcasting programmes, domestic
and foreign, I am prepared to bet that
there are times during every day when
the ether from Kamchatka to Kerguelen
Island and from sea level to the top of
the ionosphere is so charged with
crooners commiserating with little man
about his busy day that the great globe
wheels to one lugubrious and extremely
rhythmical tune, which must have a very
depressing effect on it. Now, if Cyril
Scott, or one of those braw iconoclastical
laddies, could produce a non-rhythmical
ditty that all the crooners would want to
croon, the price of wool would rise by
leaps and bounds. Central Europe would
pay it's debts, taxation would be abolished
and the millennium would be firmly
established in no time at all. Let them
see to it.
SIMPLICITAS.
Country Short-wave Explorations.
Static has been bad above 25 metres
lately, with a considerable amount even
on that band. As the broadcast band
was quite impossible most nights short-
wave transmissions showed their value
for the listener situated at a. distance
from stations.
The 8.8. C. No. 1 transmission was ex-
cellent from GSB on 31.5 metres, but
faded down about 6.30, and GSD (25.5)
was weaker all through. The 19-metre
band has been very good from 10.30 on,
with FYA and GSF the strongest. PCJ
improves towards the end of the trans-
mission, but is weak when opening at
11.30.
There has been very little difference in
the mornings ; at this time last year both
GSD and 2RO (which has not been heard
at all this season) were at excellent
strength between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m.
An unusual broadcast was an account
of a football match between Holland
and Switzerland. This was excellent from
PHI, and brought' with it the return of
the old announcer in good form. There
has been a bad hetrodyne on GSC (31.3)
lately until midnight. The other station
is very strong, and from the language
seems to be Siamese.
GSA, in the 49-metre band (for those
who don’t mind the hours), has been
very good in spite of considerable static ;
both GSC and GSE close down at 3 a.m.
and only GSA operates. RNE has con-
tinued excellent at midnight, but on
several nights FZI on code caused inter-
ference. FZI is at maximum strength
and with frequency very close to RNE.
The amateur 40-metre band has been
almost impossible owing to static and
fading, but the 20-metre band has had
plenty of interest for those who under-
stand code.
Stations from all parts of Europe and
America have been audible about mid-
night, with some Americans on ’phone
at quite good strength. An interesting
discussion was heard between two 9th
district stations which were constructing
transmitters to work on the exceedingly
short wave-length of 1| metres.
Daylight reception has been practically
dead; FYA has been heard at very
weak strength around noon on odd days,
and the stations usually heard in the
mornings from America have been much
weaker than last year.
NIGHTOWL.
“Bulletin” Test Review.
( Manufacturers’ products considered worthy of
attention are tested and reviewed in this
section.)
Two of Tasma’s latest productions
have been submitted by this manufac-
turer of repute, and they are just what
would be expected of creations bearing
this name —especially good. When
midget sets first came on the Australian
radio market some'contended that audio
quality must be sacrificed for the sake
of small size. A direct answer to that
contention is Tasma Model 235. This
miniature receiver is an A.C.-D.C. model,
four valves and rectifier, in an attractive
piano-finished cabinet, and with an ex-
traordinarily pleasing tone. Reproduc-
tion is, in fact, little short of astonishing
for such a small-sized receiver. Obvi-
ously months of painstaking work are
wrapped up in the design, and
it is far from being a “made-
to-a-price” midget. Needless
to say, it is a superheterodyne,
and it makes use to the utmost
of the latest valve series. The
aerial supplied with the set is
all that is necessary for con-
sistent all - round reception,
whether running from 240-volt
A.C. or D.C. supply. This
aerial, even coiled up on the
table, is sufficient for recep-
tion of all local stations with ample
volume. Stretched out around a room
the usual run of distant stations is a
matter of ease. Transformers, coils,
chokes and other parts being impreg-
nated, the Tasma 235 is especially suited
to tropical conditions, and the user need
have no fear from trouble due to a
moist climate. Although this is a uni-
versal receiver it is perfectly safe in in-
expert hands. The dropping resistor for
the filaments is mounted at the back of
the cabinet, protected by a perforated
screen. The heat from the resistor is
thus dissipated in air and does not cause
overheating, as is the case where it is an
integral part of the chassis inside the
cabinet.
The receiver carries the usual Tasma
guarantee for 12 months, with free in-
surance against fire or burglary. Price is
£l5 19s. 6d.
Tested at the same time was the new
Tasma 255 short-wave converter, also

highly worthy of the name it bears. The
cabinet is of high finish and pleasing
appearance, and the appliance is
ideal for use with model 235. It is de-
signed to connect to any standard
broadcast receiver for short-wave con-
version. This applies also to battery re-
ceivers with R.F. amplification where
A.C. is available. The 255 Tasma con-
verter operates from the 200-260 volts
A.C. supply, and 'wave-change is by
switching, the ranges being clearly shown
on a small indicator. The tuning dial is
accurately calibrated in wave-length over
the three short-wave bands. At the fourth
position, the switch puts the aerial
straight through to the broadcast re-
ceiver. It was found that the 6F7 triode-
pentode used as detector-oscillator pro-
vides extremely stable and sensitive
operation at high frequencies, and all
the audible overseas stations such as
Daventry, Berlin, Tokio and others were
obtained with quite a short inside aerial.
This is important by reason of the fact
that not everybody is able to erect an
external aerial. As with the universal
receiver, all components are impregnated
against moisture, and so these two
Tasma products make a fine all-wave
combination for tropical use. The price
of the 255 short-wave converter is
£l3 10s.

The Q. and A. Column.
I have a short-wave superhet which, although
satisfactory, does not seem quite sensitive
enough around 25 metres and lower. The in-
clusion of regeneration on the I.F. has been
considered, but I do not want to tamper with
the transformers. Is there any other way of
obtaining regeneration, in the detector, for in-
stance ? —174.
Illustrated is a circuit diagram of the front
end of a short-wave superhet. In this case a
58 is used as an autodyne. Note the inclusion
in the control grid circuit of the coil L and
condenser C. This L/C combination is tuned
to the intermediate frequency, and has the
effect of introducing some regeneration, and
thus raising the sensitivity of the detector. The
scheme is easily tried without any complications.

Tempting Providence.
“S.W.K.”: The suburbanite, homing in
the small hours of the morning, was
about to turn in through his front gate
when he noticed the figure of a man
emerge from the shadows in the front of
the next-door residence, hurry through
the gate and make off down the street,
a sugar-bag slung over his shoulder.
Giving chase he rapidly overhauled
his quarry. A push sent the fleeing
marauder sprawling with a crash of
broken glass and the heavy thud of a
bulky object hitting the ground.
Curiosity prompted the conqueror to |
look inside the bag containing the swag.:
Then suddenly he leaped to his feet.
“Say,” he said, “did you pinch that
out of the place with the white front |
fence and privet hedge?”
The burglar sullenly nodded assent.
His captor’s manner changed to some-
thing resembling abject apology.
“There seems —er—to have been a mis-
take,” he said. “Here is something to
compensate you for your loss.”
Then, pressing a note into the hand
of the amazed burglar, he hastened back
toward his own home.
And as he went he mopped his brow,
and soliloquised thus:
“Gosh! What a damfool I was. Get-
ting away with the chassis and valves of 1
next-door’s wireless set, and if a cop had
heard the row and landed him they’d
have got it back. Phew!”
Languages.
“Sef”: Purists tell us the King’s Eng-
lish is seldom spoken in our country,
but we contrive to express our feelings in
other languages. The tongue generally
known as Australian was spoken color-
fully by the old bullock-drivers, and is
now in use by golfers and taxpayers. It
is a language of few words, the Great
Australian Adjective being the main one.
Tram conductors speak an interesting
language, made up of words such as
“Fezplease” and “Olderaminnitalf.” This*
dialect has been elaborated by the strange
tribe of cricket and football worshippers.
Their language is called “barracking,”
and its monotonous chants have been
known to drive Englishmen to distrac-
tion and poultry farms.
Inebriates speak another weird tongue
which sounds very thick around six
o’clock and after smoke concerts.
Almost every Australian knows one or
all of these languages. Those who don’t
know them speak the racecourse jargon.
Although this includes a number of Eng-
lish words they are put to peculiar uses.
Horses are referred to as “morals,”
“certs.” and “dead-’uns,” although they
are generally more or less alive and there
is nothing to show that they are very
moral. “Whatdayerno” and “Sheorta-
walkome” are words which are generally
accompanied by winks, queer facial
grimaces and low whispers.
The beauty of all these languages is
the ease with which they can be learnt.
Beginners may invent their own words as
they go along and find that they are just
as satisfactory as the old ones.
In the vast show of photographs at
the Athenaeum (Melbourne) exhibitors —
or selectors —have embraced the decent
principle that a photograph should be a
photograph ; there are few which trans-
gress, and there are no examples of
wholesale faking, in which the camera
merely suggests the finished picture,
common a few years ago. There
are 340 exhibits, almost every country
in the world represented. Places as far
apart as Latvia and Dutch East Indies
have sent their photographs; and the
general standard is unquestionably high.
“Popular Wireless” (Eng.) says that one
has only to read some of the short-wave
notes in The Bulletin to realise that
“they take far more interest in short
waves than we do over here.” The
reason is not far to seek. In Europe
countless foreign stations may be heard
strongly on the regular broadcasting
channels, but in Australia it is a different
question ; one of distance. A few Ameri-
cans, Japanese and possibly an Indian
appear on sensitive receivers in good
locations in winter-time, but such recep-
tion cannot by any stretch of imagination
be termed entertainment. Short waves
present a different story, and. for quite
long periods Australian short-wave lis-
teners can really enjoy overseas pro-
grammes by this medium, a matter of
real value to a continent so far from the
rest of the world.


SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
After their wonderful run of successes
in other big Victorian handicaps, invad-
ing horses failed in the Williamstown
Cup. Gothic Gem (14 to 1), trained at
Mentone by E. J. O’Dwyer, won the
rich prizes—£2200 in cash and a £100
trophy—for Harry Boan, the Perth draper.
Boan, a fine sportsman, landed the
A.J.C. Derby of 1910 with Tanami, but
dropped out of racing during the war
period. About three years ago he en-
trusted the management of his West-
ralian business to a son, became almost
a permanent resident of Melbourne, and
re-entered the ranks of horseowners. He
gave 600 guineas for Gothic Gem and
1250 guineas for Spearflash (Spearhead—
Valotte). There has been a tardy return
on this outlay, but Gothic Gem now is
in the limelight as a four-year-old and
Spearflash also should improve with' age.
Punters at Williamstown couldn’t do
a thing right. They were particularly
astray as regards the Cup. Believing
that the race could be “picked in three,”
they sent Nightly out favorite at 5 to 1,
with Panto and La Trobe at' 6 to 1.
Frank McGrath was one of those who
voted for La Trobe, having been strongly
impressed by his third to Peter Pan and
Bert: " Did Vou Enjoy THE GuAvRDS

Sarcherie in the Melbourne Cup. The
poor form of Nightly in the Melbourne
Cup and the Duke of Gloucester Cup was
disregarded. The Maorilander had every
opportunity, but the pace was too fast
for Nightly. He is far from being another
Amounis, who captured the Williams-
town Cup so easily with 9st. 91b. six
years ago ; however, the time for the
mile and a half on Saturday was
faster than when Amounis Won, despite
rain having fallen on the previous day
and in the early morning.
lolaus more than covered the expenses
of his trip to Melbourne by finishing
second, his share of the stake-money
being £5OO. He finished impressively
and reached the judge a neck in advance
of Sol Green’s colt Worthing, who had
looked all over a winner until cut/ down
by Gothic Gem. The style in which
Dempsey handled Gothic Gem was most
artistic. If things had gone his way to
the same extent in the Caulfield Cup
that race must have been won by Sir
Simper, but Dempsey does not shine
when his mount gets buried in the pack.
Though built on somewhat smaller
lines, Gothic Gem in color and con-
formation is a replica of Gothic, who
died in his second season as a sire. Sol
Green s stud at Bacchus Marsh received
another advertisement when Verberry
landed the Altona Trial Handicap. This
colt is by Verbius (imp.) from Fox Berry
(imp.), a sister to Foxlaw, winner of the
Ascot Gold Cup and £13,536 in stakes
on the English turf. The bottom had
been knocked out of the market for year-
lings in 1933, but F. H. Robinson gave
550 guineas—top price of the season —
for Verberry. The manner of Verberry’s
victory was even more noteworthy than
that of Gothic Gem. At the home turn
he appeared to be out of the race, but
as soon as the colt saw daylight in the
straight he made a meteoric rush along
the rails and won, running away, by 71-
lengths from the 5-to-2 favorite Dan-
dalla.
Jack Holt should have won a double
at Williamstown. He took the first divi-
sion of the Ozone Highweight with Some
Hero, a brother to Hall Mark. In the
next division Press Gang was blocked
when making a winning effort on the
rails. Success went to a 50-to-l chance,
Ballachulish, by half a head from Scul-
pin. The majority of spectators ex-
pected the number of Sculpin to be
hoisted. One big bookmaker yelled with
delight over the result. McShortodds
had a really royal day.
* * * *
Beaten lengths by Buonarroti at
Moorefield the previous Saturday, when
obviously short of a gallop, Mr. Kerry
was neglected in the betting on the Clyde
Handicap at Rosehill. Twenty to one
could be got anywhere, the seven fur-
longs being reckoned too short for him.
Evidently suited by the track and the
small field, he had Buonarroti settled
a furlong from home ; Windbird was a
poor third. The favorite, Bronze Hawk,
backed from 7 to 2 to 9 to 4, would
not stretch out for Darby Munro ; he
just beat Dame Moab for fourth place.
Dominion - owned but Sydney - bred
King March (10 to 1) was lucky to de-
feat Senior in the November Handicap.
The riding of Senior did not please the
stewards, who censured Britt after the
race ; he came with a wet sail in the last
furlong and just failed to reach King
March. Magnitas was a close third ; he
looked a winner at the turn, but his
rider got into a pocket at the Leger.
Roxburgh essayed to lead throughout—
unwise tactics, as the little grey has a
fine run when allowed to become bal-
anced. He has always done best when
raced from behind.
Darby Munro has won many races
through waiting on the rails. On High
Form (6 to 1) he seized the opportunity
in the Novice Stakes as the field swung
for home, and the rest was a procession.
Cinema covered more ground than any
other runner, and his second was a good
effort; but the favorite, Trick, after lead-
ing most of the way, finished weakly.
High Form was bought by F. Christey,
cattle- and horse-dealer, for 65 guineas,
and is now a bargain at that figure.
Rosehill trainer Stanton, who had
Holdfast, nearly landed a double with
Wykeham and Silver Rose. The former
(6 to 4) captured the first heat of the
Two-year-old; Silver Rose (5 to 4) went
under to Allegiance (12 to 1) by half a
head in the second division. She lost
the race through lugging out most of
the way.
Morse (7 to 1), now trained by Frank
Dalton for two Sydney businessmen, W.
A. Freeman and R. K. Richards, battled
on really well to defeat Tarvila and Pro-
cure in the first division of the Maiden
Handicap. Pantress (Pantheon—Tressie)
collected the second division at 6 to 1
from Wattle Day and Musk Deer. The
latter failed to get a clear passage. He
is a good type of three-year-old by Cot-
tingham, who, after doing a season at the
stud, returned to England.
Carrying a penalty for a win at Rose-
bery, the Heroic colt Hope (5 to 1)
made hacks of the opposition in the
Rydalmere Mile. He was under the
whip at the turn, and, responding gamely,
shot through on the rails to account for
Chatterelle and Tobago. Imitate, backed
from the right quarter, had every chance.
Earlminster came home well.
(Continued on page 36.)
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
The Sydney Stadium management
does some absurd things. It brings
boxers like Johns and Sarmiento from
abroad, to be settled in a few punches
and shipped back again straightway,
while it cold-shoulders Australians like
Palmer and Henneberry, who can both
fight and “draw.” Neither has had a
match at Rushcutter Bay for ever so
long. They are both young enough to be
capable of improvement, and in repeated
matches lies the only way of perfecting
their skill; but these opportunities are
denied them at the Stadium. True,
Palmer, a heavyweight, has been offered
a fight' with Carroll, a welterweight. A
more preposterous match was never sug-
gested. If Palmer lost, it would be the
end of him as an attraction ; if he won,
it might be the end of Carroll as a boxer.
* * * *
Palmer had little difficulty in disposing
of Spagnola, 121 b. heavier, at Fitzroy. It
lasted 15 rounds —the limit—and Palmer
won every round; in fact, had he not tem-
pered stoush with mercy, the vast house
might have been dismissed two minutes
after the first gong. The premises at
Fitzroy provide accommodation for 1400.
About 3000 contrived to jamb themselves
in somehow, the overflow causing the
collapse of a timber platform—fortu-
nately without serious injury to anybody.
* * * *
“G.M.”: G.P.S. heads in Australia
continually sing the praises of amateur-
ism. To my mind a proportion of the
boys who row in their annual boat races
are professional athletes. These are the
boys whose parents keep them at school,
not to learn anything, but to take part
in the Head of the River races. They
are actually paid for their services as
oarsmen by receiving free board and
lodging, clothing and pocket money for
a full year. Contrast this with the lads
who fight preliminaries at any of the
various stadiums. They get a pound for
a fight—sometimes—and they spend five
times as much in tuition and training-
fees.
* * * *
Though Sonnenberg lost the only fall
to Ali Bey in their match at Sydney
Stadium, his superiority in most of the
five rounds was pronounced. The finish
was sudden. A push behind sent Bey
through the ropes; his head hit a ring-
side seat with some force, and he did not
answer the call for the sixth round. At
Leichhardt Haban Singh outpointed King
Elliott. Fie is a “straight” wrestler of
parts.
Ins and Outs
Unfavorable weather affected the gates
for the Woodfull-Ponsford match at
Melbourne; nevertheless, £1430 was
taken on the first two days. Barnett,
Ebeling and Fleetwood-Smith played with
The Rest, who batted first and were dis-
missed for 196 (Fingleton 57, Badcock
64; Grimmett 5 for 64). Brown and
McCabe opened for the Eleven; at 5
McCabe had to retire with a fractured
finger, hit when he was trying to hook
fast-bowler McCormick. Thanks chiefly
to the beneficiaries the scbre was taken to
316 (Woodfull 111, Ponsford 83; Nagel
3 for 63). On Monday The Rest had
3 down for 250 (Richardson 107, Bad-
cock 87).
* * * He
“Tenth Slip”: No wonder N.S.W. has
to fall back on ruins when picking an
inter-State team (B. 24/10/’34). Selectors
never seem to make an attempt to give
an unknown a chance, however promis-
ing his form, until he is shoved under
their noses. Bradman had to be brought
from Bowral by private enterprise, though
his fame was wide in the land, and Mc-
Cabe is another country star who travelled
the same road. If it hadn’t been for
Sydney enthusiasts and their clubs both
lads would still have been playing cow-
pasture cricket. O’Reilly, it is true, was
a Sydney product. But he had to bowl
in miraculous fashion and wear all the
hair off the top of his head pushing
through the N.S.W.C.A. wire entangle-
ments before he could get recognition.
(Continued on page 36.)
The Nineteenth Hole
“Stands Scotland where it did?” It
must' be gratifying to North Britons to
reflect that both McLean, who led the
amateurs in the Vic. centenary event, and
Thomson, who lifted the £lOOO prize,
come from the right side of the Tweed.
Though Thomson, like many another
U.S.A. pro., is a naturalised American
he first learnt about' golf in North Ber-
wick, where he was born. White, the
Sunningdale pro., who frequently figures
in foursomes with the Prince, is his uncle.
Thomson’s score of 283 (five under
fours) was good enough to win any
open; _ most critics expected 286 to do
the trick. The winner played almost
faultless golf in all departments through-
out the three-day struggle, but it was his
deadly putting that stood to him best.
This despite the fact' that the weirdly-
shaped putter which he favors wa-
barred.
Naismith’s splendid effort helps
further to dispel the legend that brawn
is essential in a front-rank golfer. The
Victorian pro. is smaller and frailer-
looking than many an associate long-
marker ; yet he hit tremendous dis-
tances off the tees and through the fair-
ways, and he seemed to finish as fresh
as he had started. Considering his youth
and relative inexperience, it was an aston-
ishing feat to divide third money with
Sarazen. He was the only Australian to
get in the first eleven.
(Continued on page 36.)
“Canny Lad”: One would have
thought that such bodies as State sport-
ing organisations wouldn’t feel a levy
of a paltry sixpence per member to build
up a fund to dispatch the next Olympic
team to wherever it is going. Yet it
seems to be the regular thing for one
sport or another to kick against the
regulation, though the money is eventu-
ally collected from the members. The
swimmers seetm to be the worst. South
Australia takes the lead this time with
a proposal that the levy be boycotted.
If S.A. had a good swimmer when
Olympic time came round it would be
foremost in yelping for his or her selec-
tion.

Under the Whip
As has been demonstrated on many
occasions, an average Melbourne Cup race
takes a lot out of the winner, and the
state of the track on the first Tuesday
in the month at least doubled the diffi-
culty of Peter Pan’s task. He accom-
plished it wonderfully, but evidence that
it told on him was abundantly afforded
in his struggle with Broad Arrow for
the Duke of Gloucester Cup on the
Saturday, which may have taken toll of
the big chestnut in its turn. So he may
not be the certainty he looks for the
Duke of Gloucester Plate at Randwick
on Thursday. The distance is a mile and
a half. The maximum burden is only
9st. 51b,, so the A.J.C. handicapper had
to allot Peter’s opponents weights which
will be luxuries to many of them. Fancy
a Metrop. winner (Waikare) with 7st.
1 lib. and another (Regal Son) with 7st.
31b.! Soft Step had 9st. in the Melbourne
Cup. He came down to 7st. 81b., but' is
not to start; Brown Force (7st. 101 b.) is,
however, to represent Queensland.
Dr. Stewart McKay, the authority on
racehorses’ hearts, will very likely have a
wager against Peter Pan, but most punters
will chance his having gone off. If vic-
tory goes to a horse that did not make
the journey to Melbourne —and they
nearly all had a trying time on the wet
tracks—it may be reserved for Satmoth
(7st. 111 b.).
* * * *
“D.E.”: Mention has been made of a
Sydney bookmaker who was fined £269
by the Commonwealth Commissioner of
Taxation for having “omitted” income
amounting to £16,214. Another Sydney
odds-caller caught it' even hotter —■
he “omitted” £16,550 for the three
years to June 30, 1931, and had to cough
up £377. Each gentleman mixed punting
with his registered calling, so possibly
there was an excuse for their forgetful-
ness ; but it couldn’t have impressed Mr.
Ewing.
* * * *
“Silver P.” : The sort of journalist who
hovers about bookmakers’ stands (I do
it myself) and notes down the huge wagers
he hears interests me. I never see him
at work, nor am I ever a witness to the
vast transactions he records so blithely;
but it affords me profound satisfaction to
read about them in the paper next morn-
ing. He has a fine carefree style. “Cater-
waul,” he will relate, “was backed off the
card for the Potwallopers’ Plate. Izzy
Spitzberger laid £l2OO to £3OO twice,
£llOO to £350 (to Paddy Mulrooney) and
3 to 1 in hundreds several times. He was
still prepared to go on at the price when
Caterwaul got a break from the barrier,
and, though he would have been up for
a fortune, he did not turn a hair. When
it seemed a million to a monkeynut on
Caterwaul, Issy merely bit the end off
another cigar.” I happen to know an
owner who won quite a good race at
Randwick at one of the big meetings
this year. He put a whole £3 on his
steed —perhaps with Mr. Spitzberger.
The trainer, for his part, risked £2. A
Sunday-newspaperman credited the stable
with “one of the greatest killings ever
seen at headquarters.”
* * * *
Horses thrive in Westralia, as scores
of classy performers, from Paul Pry to
Panto, have proved, but somehow or
other good ones are rarely bred there.
Jolly Beggar sired dozens of fair sprinters
and middle-distance horses, but nothing
approaching his own level. Of course,
Eurythmic died very early in his stud
career, but Easingwold has had time
enough. An Easingwold gelding- called
Easington picked up a race in Perth
recently. The company was poor and he
is a six-year-old, so he is never likely to
amount to much. No doubt the inferi-
ority of the locally-bred stuff to animals
bought at yearling sales on this side
of the continent is largely the fault
of the mares. They have never been
comparable with the high-class matrons
owned by breeders in other States, par-
ticularly N. S. Wales and Victoria.
* * * *
Raymond Leane, the S.A. Police Com-
missioner, claims that the licensing of
betting-shops in his State has been a
success. It has, he says, virtually put
an end to betting with children, perhaps
the worst of the abuses which grew up
when gambling on horseraces was re-
stricted to course totes ; it has also been
the means of forcing shady operators
out of pubs, billiard saloons and back
lanes. This report may possibly influ-
ence the Queensland Government to copy
the South Aus. system, and the Westra-
lian Government, too ; but it is not likely
to be adopted in Victoria or N. S. Wales.
* * * *
La Trobe’s speed trial lor the Williams-
town Cup was rather dazzling. He gal-
loped seven furlongs on the grass at
Caulfield in Imin. 28fsec. Some watches
made it lmin. 28sec. He is a four-year-
old black gelding by Simeon’s Fort
(winner of the 1928 Doncaster) out oE
Saucy Sue.
Ins and Outs
“Kerloof”: Tasmania’s Badcock is
making the most of his chances on the
mainland. Playing grade cricket with the
Adelaide club he has an average of 55.3,
with a highest score of 123 —against
Prospect in the second round. His best
performance to date, however, was top
score of 64 (out of 196) for The Rest in
“Sillay old tabbay, what? Instead of a puttah she’s
using her brassiere!”
the Woodfull-Ponsford testimonial match.
He went in first wicket down. He’ll be
ready for the Englishmen after the South
African trip.
* * * *
“First Ball”: On the subject of these
testimonial matches, what about offering
one to Warren Bardsley? It might be
declined with thanks, for Warren doesn’t
need the money—l’m told he’s done well
in New Guinea mining transactions —
but the gesture would be appreciated.
In the opinion of Bardsley’s friends, it
would remove a smudge on the
N.S.W.C.A.’s otherwise good record.
Like Charlie Macartney, he went to
England four times (1909, 1912, 1920
and 1926) and retired with a greater
aggregate and average. A complimentary
match was arranged for Mac (very pro-
perly) ; Bardsley was invited to share
one with Kelleway and Collins. He re-
fused ; and in the circumstances it was
the right thing to do. Without club
cricket there would be no Test-match
cricket. Bardsley has done more for club
cricket than any hero of a testimonial
match ; and that goes for Woodfull, too.
And to scores of youngsters he has been
a patient unpaid coach.
* * * *
“D.E.”: The late Australian XI had
a better and costlier trip abroad than
any other team has had, and got more
out of it than any other team; but
misguided friends are busy demanding
that still more should be distributed
among them. For example, the Waver-
ley Club, which shelters Kippax and
Fingleton: it has passed the subjoined
resolution “unanimously”:
This club views with alarm the action
of the Board of Control in withholding
from the Australian XI players the extra
amount earned by way of exchange in
their recent tour.
“Earned” is good, seeing that the young
men are all supposed to be amateurs.
But what is Waverley alarmed about?
* * * *
“Howzat”: The yarn that Woolley
caught Bradman at five in the last Test
match and was so elated that he forgot
to appeal once more directs attention to
the ridiculous rule in cricket rendering
an appeal obligatory. Why should
players in cricket have to appeal any
more than players in football? The um-
pire is there to do his duty, which is to
regulate observance of the rules; to re-
quire him to stand by idly while
breaches are being committed is much
the same as if the criminal law did not
require a policeman to intervene unless
the victim of an assault and robbery
were to yell “How’s that?”
Some day a bowler will
scatter the bails and middle
stump of some adversary,
forget to appeal and the
game will go on as if nothing
had happened.
“Aelred B.”: Eddie Gilbert’s reappear-
ance in Brisbane Country Week cricket
(B. 31/9/ ’34) was almost as sensational
as his historic over at the Brisbane
ground in 1931, when he got Wendell Bill
and Bradman for ducks in the one over.
Playing for North against South he took
seven wickets (six clean bowled) for 16
off 13 overs. The abo. has the best
figures of all the Queensland expresses
in Shield matches ; he has played in 12
and taken 40 wicket's, averaging 30.32.
Next comes Thurlow, 26 matches, 74
wickets at 40.44.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Oke”: The very first round of the
centenary tournament at Metropolitan
hinted at the superiority of the Ameri-
can invaders to nearly all our best men.
Sarazen led off on this trying occasion
with a 69, only one worse than the
course record, put up by young H. L.
Williams in September of last year.
Cooper (70), Ezar (70) and Kirkwood
(71) followed. Several Australian pros.,
and more than one amateur, can hold
the Americans off the tees and through
the fairways ; where the local champions
crash is on and near the greens. More
especially in the greenside bunkers.
Throughout the meeting it was easy to
distinguish an American from an Aus-
tralian. The Americans —even the rela-
tively casual Sarazen —took their time,
made exhaustive studies of lines and con-
tours, concentrated. They didn’t play ;
they fought golf, so to speak. Brilliantly
though some of the local players per-
formed, the big meeting demonstrated
that their methods are out of date.
Henceforth, according to critics who
followed the play at Oakleigh, Australian
golf, amateur as well as pro., is going
to be Americanised. One of the reasons
given. is that all the locals who shone
were imitators of the visitors, in the
matter of thoroughness, to the best of
their ability.
Gene Sarazen had to put up with a
lot of good-natured leg-pulling on
Friday evening. In Sydney he had been
rash enough to express mild wonder at
the appearance of Thomson in Australia.
Thomson, he said, was probably the
world’s longest driver, but he hadn’t
many more shots in his bag. As for
Ezar, the other unattached visitor, Gene
didn’t so much as mention him. Thom-
son could do no better than a 72 on the
first day, but on Friday, in appalling
weather, he negotiated a practically fault-
less 70. The stiff left leg driving of this
pocket Hercules is all that Sarazen,
Runyan and the others said it was; his
short game is also phenomenal.
Just as Michael Arlen claims to be the
only Armenian in society, so Ezar claims
to be the only Syrian in big golf. He
seems to run counter to all the Ameri-
can rules on concentration by joking
throughout every round. But if any-
body suffers it is his opponent, facetious-
ness being second mature to him. On
Thursday, when he hardly took one hole
seriously, so far as his big gallery could
judge, he went round in 70.
A. V. Rae, who not long ago was Vic-
toria’s boy champion, gave a marvellous
exhibition of pluck and combined steadi-
ness and brilliancy. This left-handed
amateur has every known shot, and he
doesn’t get ruffled when one of them
goes wrong. It was a notable feat to
finish, over 36 holes, level with Diegel
and ahead of such masters as Laffoon,
McLean (Britain) and Runyan.

“Mountaineer”: The L.G.U. meeting
at Leura witnessed to the high class of
associate golf in the Ma State. Mrs.
Clive Robinson (Australian) lifted the
Yallambee Cup with 159 (77-82) for the
36 holes, but Mrs. Slack (Royal Sydney)
performed the star feat of the tourney
—a 76 on Wednesday. Leura is a most
testing course, particularly in the kind
of weather that the ladies experienced
during part of their meeting. After rain
the ball doesn’t run a yard at some of
the longer holes ; and the short hillside
holes are tricky to a degree. Leura is
virtually unbunkered, but it has methods
of putting players off their game that
outdistance those of Hagen himself.
Eight balls were taken by crows on the
first day and 11 on the next.
Mrs. Robinson, partnered by Miss
Hammond (4), also returned the best
scratch score in the foursomes —a 74.
They registered two birdies and 11 one-
putt holes. A great effort, but it left
them a stroke behind the Pennant Hills
pair (Mrs. Derrin and Miss Brown), who,
with a 16 handicap, shot a meritori-
ous 85.

clubs have a father-and-son event nowa-
days, and last week’s Mountain meeting
of the N. S. Wales L.G.U. saw the
appearance of a class golfer of the third
generation. Suzanne Rankin, a New-
castle flapper, began the struggle with a
sensational exhibition at Wentworth
Falls. (She wasn’t heard of again as she
had the bad luck to hurt her foot.) Her
mother has been a shining light at New-
castle and Royal Sydney for years, and
her grandfather was E. P. Simpson, one
of the founders of the great Rose Bay
Club and an inter-State champion.

“Bloggs”: Odd that a Scot should
have written: —■
No game was ever yet worth a rap
For a rational man to play,
Into which no accident, no mishap,
Could possibly find its way.
Scotland’s national game answers in all
respects to the above specifications. Prac-
tically the only casualty one ever hears
of on a golf links is when a player falls
dead from old age. Golf is less perilous
than ping-pong, and twice as healthy.
Rockefeller still plays at 95, and a girl
of 11 is alleged to have beaten her father,
who taught her the game, with a 96
off the stick in England last month.
According to Paul Runyan, captain of
the visiting American team of pros.,
there are four million golfers in the
U.S.A. alone ; they can’t all be irrational,
so Gordon was obviously wrong when
he made his celebrated generalisation.
The fact is, golf’s very freedom from
danger is what makes it so popular. If
you want to ruin a modern game as a
sport for the masses, introduce an
element of serious danger to it. Hence
the row over bodylining.

“Pom”: Joe Kirkwood made a mys-
terious pronouncement in a Sydney paper
last week:
I did have plans under way to bring
Joyce Wethered out to Australia next year,
but I seem to be in so bad here that they
cannot be considered now.
Joe is an American, Miss Wethered is
English; he is a pro., she (at any rate
when I last heard of her) is an ama-
teur. I saw Kirkwood and Bobby Jones
lick Tolley and Joyce’s brother Roger
at the R.A.C. course, near Epsom, a few
years ago ; and at that time the idea of
a Wethered touring under the direction
of a pro., British or American, would
have been unthinkable. Either Joseph
has been misreported or there has been
a revolution in the golfing world of
England since I last swung a club there.

Australia won the second match against
the British amateurs at Royal Mel-
bourne: one all, and no decider. Fer-
rier was the only Australian to lose his
singles, going down to McLean 8 and 7
—he’s been very much up and down
lately. McKay beat Scott 7 and 6 ; Wil-
liams trounced Garnett 7 and 5, and
Ryan was 4 and 2 against Bourn. Gal-
leries were small, and financially the tour
has been a flop.

“Jamie”: Top place in the British
L.T.A.’s ranking list for 1934 goes natur-
ally to Perry, with Austin and Hughes
next and then Sharpe and Hare, the
youngster who was to have made
McGrath look a novice. Dorothy
Round, of course, heads the women’s
table. Of the others now in Australia,
Miss Lyle is sixth and Miss Dearman
tenth.

“Waku”: As “Lucre” suggested (B.
7/11/ ’34), Stoeffen has followed his
doubles partner Lott in pursuit of the
money. Allison and Van Ryn may
be a good substitute in Davis Cup
doubles. But, with Shields a doubtful
starter in the singles and young Frank
Parker not measuring up to expectations,
Uncle’s chances of lifting the Cup from
Perry and co. look remote.
* * * *
“Rev. Knucklebone”: Footfault judges
in England have devised an “infallible”
method of spotting the infringements.
They look through the wrong end
of a pair of binoculars, and the
picture is so reduced that they can see
the ball served and the baseline at the
same time. This stuff is old as the
hills. I never knew an umpire, referee
or other official bossing any sport from
football to polo who wasn’t accused of
looking through the wrong end of the
telescope where one player or side was
concerned, if he wasn’t doing the Nelson
trick and putting the gadget to his blind
eye.
Miscellaneous
“S. Gumm”: Europeans—the Latins
especially—have gone crazy about foot-
bawl, and they play Rafferty rules. The
Italians sent a Soccer team to London
last week to meet England, and their
whole nation, from Mussolini down,
knocked off to listen to a broadcast
account. After about half of each side
had been laid out, the Englishmen won
by three goals to two. A broken nose is
their captain’s souvenir of the affair, and
one of the Italians left for home in a
bath-chair. “More like a battle than a
game” is the verdict of the London news-
papers, and for once Tory and Labor
prints are in agreement.

“Christoph”: Though Olympic swim-

24/9/’34). Last year he won all the Ma
State free-style championships from 110
yards up to a mile, and he’s keen on doing
it again. Billy Longworth won them all
in 1911-12 and 1912-13, and in 1911-12
bagged all the Australian titles as well.
Ryan had his chance to equal this last
record last season. He preferred staying
home and working to going to Brisbane
for the 220 and 440 yards.

New South Wales, represented by the
hard-riding and hard-hitting Goulburn
team, with Bob Skene No. 4 in place of

In the final Queensland showed out well,
but two fine goals to Geoff Ashton made
the finish 6-3 in favor of Ma. The handi-

Como Park, South Yarra
(Vic.), owes its existence to the late
Sidney Myer, for he contributed largely
to its completion. It is the best natural
amphitheatre in all Australia and one of
the finest in the world. Originally part
of it was swamp, and it gained its first
fame as the spot marked X where the
body was cast into the Yarra in the
Boot Trunk tragedy. It has sweeping
hills on two sides, and when a grand-
stand is erected on the north side it
will be a fitting location for an Olym-
pic meeting with 100,000 spectators. The
local Mayor asserted at the opening that
it would always be retained for purely
amateur sport —that bars Victorian
League and Association football. Con-
sidering its perfection as a sports arena,
I question the “always.”

Cheap Money—But Tight
The present market yield on Austra-
lian Consols is around 3 p.c.; in London
last week British 3 p.cs. went to 97, the
highest figure since 1908. On twelve-
month fixed deposits Australian banks
pay only 2} p.c.
Money is cheap—dirt-cheap—for those
with sound and remunerative security.
But those trying to float new and un-
proved enterprises find finance extremely
tight. People have little money to risk ;
the return on their outlay must be sure
rather than spectacular. Most investors
lost money during the slump, and are
now doubly cautious about losing any
more.
Cheap money has not done all it pro-
mised, largely because low interest rates
are available only for new loans ; old
loans were cut 22\ p.c. and left at that.
New concerns, once established, would
reap the benefit of cheap borrowing;
but how many new businesses of conse-
quence have set up since depression
struck? Established concerns with good
credit and short-term liabilities have
been the chief gainers ip the natural re-
duction of accommodation charges, which
are now greatly below rates ruling im-
mediately after the 4s. 6d.-in-the-£ reduc-
tion. But the legacy of boom-time bor-
rowing remains with many because that
was when most businesses overstretched
themselves and borrowed on debentures
or long-term mortgages.
The latest Commonwealth Loan is being
issued at £99 155., carrying 3 p.c., repay-
able in 1948. The yield will be just a
shade over 3 p.c. Governments are for-
tunate in being able to raise money so
cheaply, the security offered being the
right to tax private enterprise. Private
enterprise can’t get money at 3 p.c.
What of “Bonds”?
Maoriland’s Company Commission
was not restricted to McArthur; it also
tackled the long-overdue question of
bond companies.
The N. S. Wales Companies Inquiry
didn’t particularly touch upon bond —or
land-utilisation—concerns, but they call
for investigation in Australia also. Bond
issues in the Commonwealth should
either be prohibited or regulated by legis-
lation. No specific legislation covers
them at present.
Anti-share-hawking legislation (Queens-
land has it, and S. Aus. is to try it) will
not overcome more than a fraction of
the company evils existing at' present.
Complete new statutes covering all
aspects of investment contracts are re-
quired.
Bond schemes are unwieldy, uneco-
nomic and wasteful. Bondholders
take most of the risks, and, as
a rule, come second in the distri-
bution of profits—if any. A handful
of ordinary shares (issued for considera-
tion other than cash, too) controls a
bond-issuing concern which is asking for
over £200,000 cash from prospective
bondholders.
The cost of selling bonds is far too
high. It is possible for promoters
to make a very good thing out of it for
themselves, even if the actual industry
comes to nothing. The canvassing organ-
isation holds much too elevated a place
in some concerns; the high-pressure
salesmanship racket has been sickeningly
overdone.
Anti-share-hawking legislation will not'
of itself stop go-getters from operating.
It is only a half-measure.
Hold the Good Stuff
Many speculators are wondering how
seriously the Australian gold-mining in-
dustry can be taken. The share-market
is weak —it has been drifting for a
couple of months. The bears have come
in on some stocks where punters have
been paying highly for prospects. A
scandal in the running of a co. here
and there has been taken advantage of.
Speculators in many cases have been
dealing on margin—borrowed money—
and, though this is highly profitable on
a buoyant market, it is disastrous under
present conditions. Where a broker who
is “carrying” a punter has to cover his
loan by selling his client out, more forced
sales by other brokers are likely to
follow.
On September 27 Sons of Gwalia
shares were 535. in Adelaide; on Nov.
9 they were 48s. Wiluna during the
same interval dropped from 86s. to 785.,
New Guinea Goldfields from 7s. 2d. to
6s. Bd., Norseman from 39s 6d. to 375.,
Triton from 14s. 6d. to 125., Bulolo from
£9 ss. to £8 10s., Great Boulder from
14s. 6d. to 135., Lake View and Star from
345. 9d. to 325. 6d., Paringa from 6s. 2d.
to ss. 3d., North Kalgurlie from 235. sd.
to 225. 3d. In nearly every instance there
has been a weakening ; in the case of the
foregoing, which are nearly all producers
of standing, the ebbing of share-market
support has been nominal, but never-
theless significant.
It points to something which should give
those carrying scrip at a share-market
loss fresh heart. Lake View and Star
and North Kalgurlie are highly pros-
perous mines, paying good dividends, yet
their market valuation has receded.
Where such stocks are weak there is a
suggestion that the whole mining-share

“The swindlers! Charged me three bob

a word about to-day’s bargain sale!”
market is undergoing a process of re-
adjustment independently of the mines
themselves or the price of gold.
Those who bought into mining cos. as
mines and were satisfied to wait upon
development results shouldn’t be unduly
concerned with the present state of
affairs. If mine prospects warranted
the price when the scrip was bought,
prospects should still warrant it. So
when an investor asks himself, “What’s
happening to Oxides?” he should
make full allowance for the fact
that the fever has departed and that with
its departure there has been a temporary
all-round relapse.
King Solomon ; s Mines
The prospectus of King Solomon’s
Mines, Ltd., registered “pursuant to the
company laws of W.A.,” is in some re-
spects disappointing. Neither Rider Hag-
gard nor the Queen of Sheba is repre-
sented on the board. Alan Quatermain
is not mentioned anywhere.
But there are (take a big breath)
1,500,000 shares —of threepence each,
making nominal capital £18,750. The
office is in A.M.P. Buildings, Perth, and
A. W. Crooks is the secretary. The
company “has acquired an option to pur-
chase the prospecting area No. 1401,
comprising about 24 acres, situated at
the townsite of Gullewa on the Yalgoo
Goldfields.
Consideration for the option, it seems,
is 10,000 fully-paid shares to Cain and
—no, not Abel—Franzinelli; 40.000 f.-p.
shares and £SOO cash to Gold Mining
Investments and Supplies, Ltd.—this to
be passed over “simultaneously with the
company proceeding to allotment”; on
the co. exercising the option “the sum of
£2000” goes to Cain and Franzinelli,
and £3OOO to Gold Mining Investments
and Supplies, Ltd.
The people are being asked for only
£11,875, though it is in 950,000 shares.
If they use the application form appended
to the published prospectus they “agree
to waive any further compliance with
Section 222 of the Companies Act, 1893,
or other requirements of the law other
than contained in the said prospectus.”
“The property when last worked was
known as the Phoenix Gold Mine, and
the Mines Department records show a
return of 10,616 ounces won from
11,593 tons.” Those figures, according
to the prospectus, were also quoted in a
letter dated 7/11/1907, written by the
liquidator of Phoenix when endeavoring
to sell the property.
R. L. Nash’s “loint Stock Companies
Year-Book” for 1904, under heading of
Phoenix Gold Mines, Ltd., refers the
reader to Crown Gold Mines, Ltd. This
co. was registered in England in 1903
to acquire the properties of Phoenix Gold
Mines. According to' Nash “the proper-
ties now [1904] held are at Yalgoo,
Mount Magnet and Coolgardie, and it
is proposed to work the Yalgoo (Gul-
lewa) property.” With what, result the
volume doesn’t say.
Queensland’s Idle Men and Money
Queensland has a Bureau of Indus-
try, its main object being to deal with
unemployment problems. Its first meet-
ing was held on February 22, 1933, and
its first report has been compiled to June
30 last.
“The very remarkable situation exists
in Queensland of a community which
has simultaneously the lowest proportion
of unemployment amongst Australian
States and, for men wage-earners, the
highest hourly labor costs and the high-
est average wage, both in money and in
of food and rent.” The bureau
doesn’t say this as a compliment to itself.
But it points out that since 1931 the
number of unemployed has decreased by
about 20,000, from 22.8 p.c. to 15 p.c.
The bureau’s second job has been to
consider and recommend proposals for
the development of industries. As regards
agriculture, “it was found that any speci-
ally subsidised expansion could be justi-
fied under prevailing circumstances only
for three commodities—namely, bananas,
tobacco and cotton—-and for these only
to a limited extent and under very special
conditions.” Generally, the bureau
found that to equip unemployed with
land, housing and working capital in
many primary industries was merely to
“transfer unemployment from one set
of persons to another” —so difficult were
the conditions of those already battling
in such industries.
Further cold water is thrown on
“schemes for subsistence settlements and
self-supporting colonies. . . . There were
unfortunate experiences of such settle-
ments in the depression of the ’nineties.”
As regards mining, early in the piece
the bureau gave assistance to prospec-
tors. It now recommends that three
additional geologists should be appointed
and that extensive surveys and field
work should be carried out. It also sug-
gests that the data on the known mineral
areas in Queensland should be brought
up to date and published, and that a
modern geological map should be
drafted.
A special committee was formed in
1933 to investigate the possibilities of
greater employment in ordinary industry
and trade: —
The committee pointed out that taxa-
tion and restrictions were generally dis-
couraging to enterprise, and that these
were much higher or more pronounced than
previous period of the depression,
the failure of manufacturing and trading
enterprise to recover its former confidence
is due largely to the reduced volume of
uu® lness in particular concerns, and the
dilhculty of recovering all costs even when
unit costs have fallen. Excessive competi-
tion is often a factor in this situation, and
some old theories on this subject are now
obsolete. Overhead costs are now a larger
proportion of all costs than previously,
especially when selling costs arc included.
Recovery awaits the prospects of an
adequate volume of business for each indus-
try dependent on volume for its prosperity,
this prospect in turn awaits the restora-
tion of world trade and the lifting of inter-
national barriers.
The committee supported the mainten-
ance of purchasing power by the prudent
expenditure of loan moneys on reproduc-
tive works, and more particularly when the
cost of such works is lower than in
normal times, Such works are not now
competitive with private enterprise, either
in their employment of men or of money,
and, although they impose future costs
and are no remedy for the world depres-
sion, they are a necessary economic de-
fence.
Direct assistance to Queensland in-
dustries up to August 31, 1934, consisted
of advances of £5300 to pottery manu-
facturers and the guarantee of £622,000
of loans, including £500,000 borrowed by
Mt. Isa and £100,000 by Hornibrook
Highway, Ltd.
Over the teacups at Australia House —
no telegraph posts in them—one of a
hundred branch managers
of the Royal Arsenal Co-
op. entertained by Bruce
paid a notable compliment
to Australian-grown raisins.
“Ten years ago,” he said,
“they arrived in England
like a big mess. Now they
are the best in the world.”
Digger irrigation-blockers
in three States have played
a great part in the trans-
formation.

don Milford-Smith, started a one-man
factory for the bottling of passion-fruit
in London. To-day he owns a flourishing
plant' (it covers 8000 sq. ft. of land), and
employs a large staff. Australian passion-
fruit cocktail is now regarded by some as
the best; at the Wine-catering Trades’
Exhibition in London not long ago our
passion-fruit juice was used in 20 per
cent, of the 3000 entries for the Empire
cocktail competition.

“X.T.”: Ironic note from the Bulletin
of the Queensland Bureau of Industry:
The Golden Casket: This most pros-
perous “industry” is now rivalled only by
motor-car sales. Tickets before the depres-
sion averaged about £1 per head of
Queensland population, and (exclusive of
sales outside the State) are now approxi-
mately the same. The “Mammoth” lot-
teries attract large subscriptions from out-
side the State—£36B,ooo (46 p.c.) to
September 5 last.
It’s a paying show, too —except for most
subscribers. During the past five years
its annual profit has ranged from 24.6
p.c. to 29.1 p.c. The hospitals last year
got £322,401 out of £1,297,499 poured
into the gamble.
* * * *
“Bill Ding”: As people don’t boggle
at paying up to 3s. for a small box of
good-quality stationery, there should be a
market here for an Australian writing-
paper made from the waste of pine plan-
tations and offcuts of its softer hard-
woods. Over in Memphis (U.S.A.) a
man has produced a fine writing-paper
from a timber not hitherto suspected of
such quality—slash pine. One of the
New York chain organisations, with 500
stores, has given him an order for
240,0001 b.

“Kaloa”: When, in pelting rain which
made the tracks almost impassable, the
first sub-branch of the R.S.S.I.L.A. on
Mandated N.G. mainland was formed,
53 duckboard artists turned up. Among
them were Australians, Maorilanders,
Englishmen, Scots, Irish, Welsh, Cana-
dians, Serbians and Italians.
* * * *
“Gain”: One sampan captain must
be feeling sorry for himself. Barging
into the Mandated Territory he was de-
tained by the kiap at Maron (Admiralty
Islands). He had only an old-fashioned
eight-knot sampdn, very different from
some of the modern affairs which are
plucking the North Australian reefs clean
of shell, but the District Court fined him
a total of £173.0 for contraventions of
the Customs, Fisheries and Quarantine
ordinances, gave him six months’ hard
for breach of the Immigration Ordinance,
and fined each of the 23 members of his
crew £1 for illegal fishing, besides stow-
ing them in the calaboose for six months
as prohibited immigrants. Next time
they will probably see the wisdom of
operating in Australian waters, where
raiders seem to be immune from inter-
ference, instead of in the Mandate.
* * ❖ *
“Dungeness”: Booby Island (B.
7/11 /’34) is connected in Torres Strait
memories with the tragic end of one
of its former lightkeepers. Capsized in
a dinghy nearly opposite to the T.I.
Hospital, he was wading ashore towing
the craft'. A companion, wading ahead,
lost sight of him, returned to see blood
in the water and made for shore. The
unlucky lightkeeper was picked up soor
after, decapitated by a shark. My owr
chief memories of Booby are of swim-
ming at high water over the wide fring-
ing reef, with a lookout posted on the
cliff above to give warning of sharks. A
hail brought the swimmers out in recoid
time. The famous sea post office was
in a long narrow cave on the north-west
side, and many names of old-time ships
were marked on the walls in smoke oi
tar. There is wonderful fishing to be
had around Booby.
* * * *
“Vic”: The pot of one of the finest
corroborees ever played in Caledon Bay
is boiling nicely. Tuckiar is free. If he
gets home he will become a Ulysses in
his tribe, and his story will be acted
every year when his tribe assembles till
the Great Spirit climbs down out of the
trees of heaven and claims the last per-
former. There will be all sorts of char-
acters in Tuckiar’s play—a missionary,
naked except for a few parrot feathers,
but made perfectly recognisable through
excellent mimicry ; a few naked police,
armed and terrible, but succumbing to
the skill and valor of the tribe ; a warder
with his keys; Judge Wells ; a photo-
grapher or two, rather magical; and there
will be Greta Garbo? Greta can expect
only an ephemeral fame from her pub-
licity agent, but Tuckiar, whose first
sight of her constituted his final contact
with civilisation before he removed his
trousers and stole silently into the woods,
will see that the memory of her does not
perish in Arnhem Land. If I know his
kind, he is carrying a detailed picture
of the minutiae of her gestures in that
peculiarly acute and observant mind of
his. And, if some traveller a thousand
years hence is curious about the roars
of laughter which rise from around the
campfires of Caledon, he will probably
discover the cause in a large, black, hairy
Greta, his whiskers done out in parrot
feathers and his body daubed with kopi,
reproducing the lady to the life.

“Fitz North”: Looking at the list of
the executive of the Sydney Queensland
Association, which has just issued its
annual report for 1933-34, I am inclined
to wonder what happens to all the bright
young people of the south who want to
rise in the world. Among that compass
of a dozen names or so I find an ex-
Town Clerk of Sydney (W. G. Layton);
J. J. C. Bradfield, who built the Harbor
Bridge ; John McKelvey, the Prime Min-
ister’s “physician in ordinary” ; Clifton
Love, who is in nearly everything ; H. A.'
Goddard and Jim Cannan, a couple of
generals (one represents the London
“Times” in Australia, the other is
g.m. of a big insurance company); G.
C. Somerville, secretary of the Sydney
Royal Agricultural Society; D. G.
Donald and Grant Hanlon, secretaries of
Sydney Hospital and Picton Lakes
Home. Even the directorate of the “S.
M. Herald” is represented. The asso-
ciation added 62 to its strength during
the year, and will be glad to double the
increase in the next year. The honorary
secretary is Grant Hanlon, Picton Lakes
Office, 4 Bridge-street.
* # * *
“Endeavour”: Lately I did a run by
motor-train from Cooktown to the
Laura. But the charm of the old train
which ran three times or more a week
was gone. The modern vehicle spun
along casually, but not so casually as the
old-timer. Along the line in the wood-
burning days the train used to fuel at
cord-wood stacks. The driver and fire-
man would throw in one length of wood
and look about them. The guard would
stroll along, stopping to speak to odd
passengers, before joining the fatigue
party. After a bit, one or two passengers
not used to the routine would become
impatient. This would be a signal for
the wooders to sit down and have a
yarn. After a bit one passenger would
stroll along and take a hand. Others
would join in. And, when the time was
ripe, driver, fireman and guard would
sit back and wipe their foreheads while
the passengers did the work.
=H * * *
“Cairns”: I enter this exhibit' of
official stupidity. Guards operating the
rail-motors on the Tully-Cairns (N.Q.)
line have been obliged to walk along the
outside of the motor whilst it is in
motion to issue tickets to passengers who
board it at sidings ; to stop would pre-
vent the rail-motor running to schedule.
Yet the regulations say that “Guards col-
lecting or distributing tickets whilst the
motor is in motion do so at their own
personal risk, the Government not being
responsible for loss of life or personal
injury sustained in doing so.” One guard
who stopped the motor whenever he had
to issue a ticket (thus conforming with
the regulations), was subsequently dis-
missed for not running to schedule.
* * * *
“Nagheer”: Moa had a worse experi-
ence in massacres than the one in the
’seventies (B. 7/11/’34). From the early
’forties a Frenchman, probably an es-
capee from the N.S.W. convict establish-
ment, lived as chief on Badu under the
name of “Wini.” Barbara Thompson,
rescued by the Rattlesnake in 1848 after
four years amongst the Prince of Wales
islanders, had met him. John Jardine,
first Resident Magistrate at Somerset,
refers in a report, dated 1865, to the
“strong influence exercised amongst the
Banks and Mulgrave islanders by him.
The natives gave me to understand that
all strangers going to those islands are
killed, and their heads cut off.” Less
than 30 years later, I heard some of
Wini’s rascalities related by old Badu
men, including the Moa massacre of the
’fifties. “Six-pfeller canoe, all fullup head
belong Moaman, Moa Mary, Moa pic-
caninny,” was the alleged bag brought
home by Wini and his merry men. A
boat' crew from the Thomas Lord,
schooner, and a watering party from a
“big-pfeller ship” were also killed by
Wini’s orders. I never had the pluck to
ask the late Frank Jardine, of Somerset,
direct, but there is good reason to believe
that he sailed across from Somerset and
shot the bloodthirsty old rascal some
time in the later ’sixties. It would have
been an act of justice in full keeping
with his fearless character.
* * * *
“East Point”: Air races don’t send
Darwin editors into hysterics. Scott and
Black got 20 lines without a heading or
a black letter when they arrived, and the
report appeared half-way down the
column under an announcement that
Francesca Bleeser, who runs one of the
many N.T. sports depots, had changed
his address, and that a gentleman who
had slipped in the dark in Frog Hollow
had been picked up with a wound in his
back. The population made up for this
moderation. The night the winners ar-
rived even the picture-shows had to shut
their doors.
* * * *
“Cudgerie”: When 1 was at the Laura
(N.Q.) Charlie Donald, son of old Bob,
ran the roomy, well-stocked store there
(B. 26/7/’34). He was also postmaster
and stationmaster. Pack-teams loaded
there for different parts of the peninsula.
The Peninsula Hotel, owned by old-man
Donald but run by the Solomons at this
time, was about 30 yards away. A young,
red-skirted lubra who could feed the
stove with her toes used to wait table
and help in the kitchen. For good tucker
and cleanliness the Peninsula shared the
honors with the Native Youth at Ross-
ville and the Lions’ Den at Helenvale,
both on the local tinfields. Drinks weie
Is. each in all three places, but they were
worth it. A man could get a real sweat
up in that region.

and Mrs. E. S. Palmer, of Ryde, Sydney, at
St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church, Creek-street.
Mrs. Palmer gave the bride away, and Jean
McPhail was bridesmaid. Clarence Harvey
was in the bridegroom’s corner. The wedding
breakfast was eaten at the Hetherington home
at Kangaroo Point, which was gay with Mocha
roses in settings of pink tulle.
Mr. and Mrs. C. J. Holt, a cheery English
couple who have been in Queensland, are off
to Maoriland in the Strathaird. So are Captain
and Mrs. Attride, of Bombay.
Mrs. Mary Maynard, one of the pioneers of
Mt. Perry, who was known and loved in
the district for her kindly and charitable
nature, has passed on. She had 12 children,
nine of whom are living and one of whom
is Mrs. H. F. Hardacre, whose husband once
was Minister for Public Instruction. Queens-
land owes Mrs. Maynard for 75 grandchildren
and 26 great-grandchildren.
Peggy Padwick, who is doing the round trip
from England to Australia and back again,
stayed with Dr. and Mrs. A. S. Roe at Toowong
while the Orontes was in port.
The Isaac Moores’ daughter Eileen came
home on the Orontes, and so did Mrs. Phil
Forrest and her daughter Nancy. Mrs. C. C.
Overell also was on board. She went to
Colombo to see daughter Joan married there
on October 20 to William Buchanan Thomp-
son.
Pat and Ella O’Shea came on the same boat,
but left it at Melbourne.
New Farm Park, where the massed roses
? re surrou nded by a circle of jacaranda trees,

aldermen and their wives. The vice-mayor and
Mrs W. R. Warmington fed them at the park
, a * tables beautified with a selection
of the best blooms from the park gardens.
Mrs. F. A. Bell, who, when she is at home,
is Commissioner for the Girl Guides in the
Enoggera district, is in England, and has been
touring Germany, where she saw the Passion
Play at Oberammergau. While she was in
Berlin the city was in mourning for Marshal
von Hindenburg.
Mrs. P. J. Kirwan is packing her trunks,
ready to leave for Ceylon, where she will stay
with daughter Molly, whose marriage to David
Cordon Duff took place there a few months
ago.
Hazel Bell, Ruth McGhie, Eileen Butler,
Joan Byres and Sybil Caswell gave a gay little
dance at the home of Mrs. L. Bell. All the
hostesses are budding Nightingales. Balloons,
colored lights and palms made the dancing-
room very festive, and flowers in shades of
yellow decked the supper-tables.
Olive Sweetnam, daughter of the late' W. J.
Sweetnam, of Denis Island Estate, Bathurst
(N.S.W.), and a sister of Mrs. Cecil Roberts
(Jill Manners), has a new diamond ring.
The lucky lad is A. McLennan, of Clayfield.
Olive and Jill claim Governor Hunter as an
ancestor.
Betty Thynne, daughter of the E. T. F.
Thynnes, of Maleny, and granddaughter of the
late A. J. Thynne, was married quietly this
week to L. J. Brady, of Bundaberg. Bob
Thynne acted as best man. After the cere-

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
By now the maypoles are up, and the
floats for the pageant, blazing with color,
soaring into the realms of poetry, his-
tory and romance, are taking a breather
in their Woolloomooloo nest before their
debut at 6.30 to-morrow morning. There
are feverish comings and goings in the
offices of the Citizens of Sydney organis-
ing committee ; the Town Hall is in the
hands of an army of decorators, its cor-
ridors a jungle of palms ; Town Clerk
Hendy, the Mayoral Parkers and Frank
Crane —the Valentino of the civic
fastness —move palely under the burden
of things to be remembered. The A.J.C.
lawns are being barbered for the nth
time. Men are beginning to ask timidly
if the new lounge suit will do for a royal
garden party or must they wear tails and
a top-hat, same as Buckingham Palace
demands. In short, Sydney, palpitating,
eager and a little nervous, awaits the
Duke.
Delysia, in rose-red chiffons of cling-
ing cut, her varnished toenails winking
gaily through the slashed-out bits of her
sandals; Delysia, in a ravishing and
trailing blue neglige, very contour-
revealing, and dripping with medkeval
sleeves that waved like azure banners
in the storm of her emotions, drew all
the best velvet and fur wraps to the New
Tivoli on Saturday night. This citi-
zeness of France really deserves to be
decorated with the Legion of Honor for
the way she wears her clothes. Why any
woman who flaunted silver foxes for
sleeves on her sleek black plumage should
bother about a past when there was so
much future ahead of her is inexplicable.
Manager Thring had garlanded the
circle and the boxes with greenery and
with flowers of rosy hue ; the vacuum-
cleaner, too, had been loud in the land,
and the place looked shiningly clean.
Every second woman in the audience
blossomed out in shoulder sprays, Mrs.
Harry Dransfield’s creamy orchids being
a de luxe finish to her black frock. Mrs.
Sep Levy brought black velvets and
Mrs. Douglas Levy ; a front-seater was
Mrs. James Dickson ; and Lorna Searl’s
lilac orchids shone against blue satins.
Blonde Mrs. Ellis Fielding Jones wore
black dashed with white.
Any afternoon last week the caller at
the Grosvenor Galleries could see Sir
Nevile Wilkinson at work on one of the
panels for Oberon’s study. The amiable
Knight of St. Patrick is not one of those
temperamental geniuses who go all over
ducky or gooseflesh if you ask them
how it’s done. In fact, there’s nothing
Sir Nevile likes better than to explain
his exquisite mosaics. The Governor
was an interested gazer and listener mid-
way through the week, and now Gov-
ernment House is the richer by a signed
photograph of the artist and a Medici
print of the flowerlike Stella Maris in
her evening blue and dying-sunset rose
cloak and gown. Artist Woodward
Smith, now doing an important job at
the Science School, brought a grass-
green shirt s and a Chinese-yellow tie to
the discours’e. Mrs. David Pratten came
with the tall Sheila Lowe. Another tall
looker-on was Noreen Dangar. Miss
Rutledge, young at 80-odd, flitted from
picture to picture brandishing a gay mag-
nifying-glass.
Sydney has been all up in the air.
Lunches and parties to flying men and
women last week captured the public
fancy, and other entertainments came a
bad second. The Royal Empire Society
made a great splash of the midday cutlet
it grilled in honor of airmen Scott and
Campbell Black. The ballroom of the
Australia was so crowded with long
tables that ‘the waiters had hardly room
to carry on. There was a last-minute
rush for cards that left the staff of the
society gasping and perspiring. Roses
bloomed on the tables, and flowers of
rhetoric were scattered to the listening
ears not only of those present, but to the
uttermost outposts of radio. The fliers
are very modest about their achieve-
ment. Scott’s hymn is that the spec-
tacular of 1934 should be the common-
or-garden variety of flight in 1935.
Jean Batten was at the top table in a
white hat and other feminine adornments.
The Kelso King lady, whose husband
presided, looked cool and attractive in
colored silks. Near by sat Mrs. Feakes
with her dignified good looks and remote
gaze. W. R. Layton, who secretaries
the society for love, held a reception of
his own in the lounge. Mrs. C. L. Jones
wore the latest interpretation of the
beret in black, and was rushing off with
husband and brother Gordon and other
important citizens to circle the city in
the new Qantas ’plane.
When the Duke of Gloucester goes for
his peaceful week-end to Gostwyck, the
Dangar house at Uralla, he will drive
along what is acknowledged as the finest
avenue of elms in Australia. Seventy of
the beauties were planted by the grand-
father of Noreen Dangar, the subject of
this drawing. Noreen, who is a tall,
handsome girl, is not leaving the lights
of the city till two days before the royal
visit to the old home. This is presided
over by her good-looking mother, Mrs.
H. K. Gordon.
On the day Scott and Black were feted
the Lyceum Club bagged Miss Rasche.
Mrs. Bonney, herself very useful with
the joystick, was another who ate com-
plimentary food and then made a
speech. Thrown in for good mea-
sure, though she has nothing to do
with the air except the family’s famili-
arity with spirits of air and water, was
Guendoline Wilkinson, daughter of the
Titania Palace Wilkinsons. The tall
daughter of a tall father said among
other things that, used as they are to the
generosity of cities, the Sydney box-office
takings have been a happy knockout to
the family.
Stormbound between the Royal
Theatre and the Australia (the rain was
coming down in sheets), supper-seeking
playgoers saw a magnificent floral cello
in Searl’s flower-shop. It was made
of mauve and pink blooms, with deep-
red roses striking a stronger note
around the edges. The bridge glit-
tered with diamente, the strings were
golden. It was a Hosanna in ’cellos,
and it bore the legend “A tribute to the
memory of Henri Verbrugghen. Ihe
small and vital Belgian who had directed
Sydney Conservatorium for six years had
many friends and admirers, as evidenced
by the remarks of the many who surged
about the window. After Mr. Ver-
brugghen left Australia he went to
the U.S.A. For 11 years he conducted
the Symphony Orchestra at Minneapolis,
and here death overtook the splendid
little musician, who was aged 61.
If royal visits are going to become a
habit, some enterprising tailor should
start a hiring-out shop such as London
abounds in. Any size and any shape
of man can be fitted out for day or
night to perfection at these establish-
ments. At this year’s royal garden party
dozens of the men wore hired suits and
hats. As a tall South African who
looked one of the handsomest present
said to this Letter,
“What should I do
with a tall hat and
a tail-coat? At
home I live in
shorts and a sun-
helmet. I hired
these for Ascot
and I hired them
for to-day.” He
turned around sud-
denly, “And, by
Georg e,” h e
grinned, “that fel-
low at the back of
me did the same.
I saw him at my
shop.”
The cabled news
of Dion Tither-
adge’s death will
bring sorrow to
the wife of Dr.
Herrick Knowles,
of Macquarie-
street. Before her
marriage she was
known to the stage
as Lily Titheradge,
and she and Dion
and a large brood
of histrionically
gifted brothers
and sisters, among
them the famous
Madge, were the
offspring of actor
George Titheradge.
Dion, besides be-
ing an actor, was
a successful writer
of plays and re-
vues, some of his
musical pr o du c-
tions being written in conjunction
with another Australian Kenneth Duf-
field. For some time Dion had made
his home on the Mediterranean littoral,
and here he did most of his writing,
going to London only when theatrical
business drew him. He had written a
great deal of verse, and at one time was
a fairly regular contributor to The
Bulletin.
In spite of the flurries of rain that a
cold wind nearly churned into sleet,
hundreds went out to the Showground
on Saturday to see the hacks and the
draught horses and the ponies. For,
funnily enough, just as half Sydney has
its mind set on travel by air, the other
half has gone all horsy. The pomes
with their small girl- and boy-riders were
a feature of the proceedings that started
—rri
with a spirited procession through the
city streets. Here stepped prideful police
horses ; draught horses in shining har-
ness drew waggons loaded with barley
and oats. Buggies, dogcarts, the ’bus
of grandpa’s day passed along the road
while bands played, and mere pedes-
trians stood to admire the kindly animal
that through the years, no matter how
the fashion in vehicles changed, gladly
did its share of the transportation.
In the Esthonian Club, which is high
above George-street, the Latvian Consul,
Norman McLeod, and his pretty wife
entertained in honor of the sixteenth
anniversary of Latvian freedom. Under
brightly-colored streamers, the company
was gay, singing its national songs, danc-
ing quick mazurka-like steps, forming
a large ring with clasped hands in what
seemed the equivalent of our “Auld
Lang Syne.” After the Royal had put
up its shutters two of the soloists from
the Russian Ballet came along, to be sur-
rounded by members of the Burlakov
School. The dark-haired Mrs. McLeod
did the honors in geranium-red chiffons.
The Smith Family’s rest home up be-
yond Parramatta is the richer by £175.
The cheque was motored up the other
afternoon in company with the bunch of
youngsters from Doone who had earned
it by their presentation of “Trelawney
of the Wells.”
On a day of mixed sunshine and Mel-
bourne weather the Czecho-Slovakian
Consular Kuraz couple beckoned tennis
enthusiasts and Consuls and those who
just love to go to parties into the Yacht
Club at Kirribilli to meet international
tennis player Roderick Menzel and his
small wife. Mrs. Menzel isn’t really
small, but her tilted-forward black hat
only reached to about the third button
on her tall husband’s vest. Good looks
must abound in the land of the Czechs
for Roderick is a handsome lad. The
Kuraz family, too, would go far in a
beauty contest. The Consul flashed dark
eyes and perfect teeth in the smile oi
welcome, and his wife wore a black plate
beret above her round, smooth face, and
was otherwise black marocains, lightly
frilled with white at the neck. Daughter
Eva aired grey-plaid taffetas and a
raspberry-red hat. White patterned in
blue formed Mrs. Menzel’s suit; Mrs.
Bruxner added a sable necklet to black
tailorings. Mrs. lan Clunies Ross s black
hat was shiny and upturned as to brim.
The Hugh Poynters were among the
dancers on the wide verandahs. Blue
hydrangeas and pink gladioli thrust up
their faces from every vantage-point.
Mrs. Preston-Stanley Vaughan, who
was this State’s first woman M.L.A., and
Minister for Justice L. O. Martin glowed
with the pride of seed well sown, of
combat won, on an afternoon last week.
The occasion was a jubilation organised
by the women’s educational circle oi the
U.A.P. over the passing of the Guardian-
ship of Infants Bill. Mrs. Vaughan, as
Millicent Preston-Stanley, president of
the Feminist Club, turned the first sod
(urged thereto by the Emelie Polini
case),- and continued the spadework for
this bill during several years. Her en-
thusiasm was such that she was eventu-
ally driven to writing a play around the
subject. This was called “Whose Child,”
and was a stirring bit of propaganda.
Now the bill is through, and congratu-
lations and flowers were heaped on the
lady by masses of public-spirited women,
and from one who sent a sheaf
simply inscribed “From a Mother.”
The argument as to what is sartorially
correct for the royal garden party is still
raging. But the printed communique
from Government House sent out with
every entree card should settle the ques-
tion. It is headed “Notes for the Guid-
ance of Guests,” and its fifth hint reads:
Dress for men will be morning dress for
those who are in possession of it, other-
wise a lounge or tweed suit may be worn.

Chatter
Contemptuously brushing aside the
allegation that the Hentys tied up their
boat to Dutton’s wharf when they
landed at Portland, that town has been
whooping loudly over its own centenary
during the last week and preparing for
the expected visit of the Duke. The
landing of the Hentys— minus, of course,
Dutton’s wharf —is to be reconstructed,
the schooner Helen Moore acting the
part of the famous Henty vessel. There
have been a race meeting, a children’s
sports meeting, a camp for some hun-
dreds of Western District people who
have overflowed the town, a horticultural
show and an official ball. Altogether
Portland is having a hectic time. Four
women are included in the 15 directors
of the celebration: Mrs. E. S. Bennett,
Mrs. A. Day, Mrs. A. Hutchinson and
Miss Elsie Pomeroy. The Henty descen-
dants are naturally among the most im-
portant exhibits —that is, the descendants
who happen to have prospered.
Elaborite precautions are taken to
prevent gate-crashing at Government
House, the grounds now being patrolled
to prevent the entrance of uninvited
persons, who not long ago discovered a
new method, supreme in its simplicity.
The aspiring one would just walk
through the outer garden gate over-
coated and muffled, slip behind a bush,
plant his hat, coat and muffler and walk
in at one of the side doors, registering
familiarity with his surroundings. It
worked splendidly until the glad tidings
became bruited abroad and the garden
became noticeably filled with charming
young men discarding their outer gar-
ments.
Since the dedication ceremony thou-
sands of people have visited the Shrine,
and there are queues waiting every
morning and afternoon. In the sanc-
tuary costly wreaths of fresh and arti-
ficial flowers and leaves are resting
beside simple tributes of the people. The
King’s wreath is of masses of small,
beautifully-made artificial poppies, with
larger poppies of a deeper red clustered
at the bottom. A wreath from Canada
is of maple leaves; there’s a heather
cross from Scotland, and sprays of
scented lavender figure in the token of
the British golfers. Battalion colors are
draped in the crypt below. The Shrine
is floodlit at night.
It was not garden-party weather for
the Victoria League’s in-and-out-of-
doors’ reception for visitors from over-
seas. Occasionally the sun came out
to justify the choice of lightly-clad
guests, but the cold winds made the
majority thankful for their furs. The
Masson lady, in a fur cape and a garden
of roses on the crown of her hat, was one
of the four hostesses who received in
the lee of a mighty elm. While a band
played the guests wandered about the
lovely garden of Grosvenor with its
prunus-trees, rose terraces and forget-me-
not borders, and afterwards went within
for tea. Among them were the Elder lady,
General and Mrs. Bruche, Mrs. Fred
Thiel, Mrs. Leo Quick, Mrs. Norman
Welch, in a black coat and a white bird
resting on her straw tarn, Mrs. Lindsay
Mildred, with white camellias on her
black coat, and Marie Macfarlane, who
wore a little pulled-forward hat with her
navy coat. Gladys Brunton was one of
the tweedy people, and Mrs. lan Mac-
donald was in-between with a pastel-
pink suit and a white felt hat.
The Peninsula Polo Club gave a very
jolly dance at Ranelagh in honor of the
visiting polo teams. As a preliminary
there was a dinner at the clubhouse,
where Cecil le Plastrier, it being his
birthday, was honored by the first toast
of the evening. Afterwards cars arrived
in droves; several Rolls-Royces were
noticed by the. light of twinkling globes
suspended above the lawns and paths.
The organisers of the festivities were
Mrs. E. M. Cornfoot, her black taffetas
patterned with red and pink carnations,
and Mrs. J. R. Dunstan in black lace.
Her youthful daughter Lynette, in the
fluffiness of powder-blue chiffon, was
somewhat of a heroine after having
scored four goals that afternoon for the
Victorian women’s polo team. Other
feminine polo players were Normc
Collins, who wore beige lace over green :
Peggy McComas, with a pleated fin run-
ning down the back of her floral frock,
and Enid Lillecrap, of S.A., who was in
scarlet.
Clare Graham brought Mrs. Hill, of
Bombay, who defended her angel-skin
lace from the chill sea breeze with a
navy taffeta coat. Riva Bull wore a
gauzy black garment, and Mrs. T. Bate-
man’s royal-blue georgettes blossomed
into taffeta flounces just above the floor.
A tall, handsome Sydney visitor was
Mrs. Douglas Nettlefold, who wore one
of the newest quilted capes to match her
scarlet slippers and the pattern upon her
floral dress. Mrs. W. B. McCrow, who
lives in one of the most charming cot-
tages at Ranelagh, wore a frock of soft
Patou pink. Supper was spread on the
verandah and lawns, where healthy
appetites were catered for, an outsize
in sausages pushing cocktail brothers
and sisters back into the nursery.
At the Aero Club Ball the “open
sesame” to the official “Hangar No. 1”
was a paper flower shaped like a sea
anemone. The orchestra, crooners and
revolving propeller kept things going in
“Hangar No. 3.” Direction-indicators
showed the way the wind was blowing
towards champagne bar, cocktail bar
and fuel dump (i.e., beer). The red-and-
blue floral ’plane banked under the roof
of the Palais, and Zeppelins and
Wapitis flew hither and thither. Presi-
dent of the Aero Club Cecil McKay
and his wife did the honors, Mrs. Mc-
Kay wearing black taffeta with a fan-
shaped pleated ornamentation across the
front of the corsage. Controller of ■
Aviation Edgar Johnston escorted his
wife, in a floral frock with orchid-
shaded neck draperies. Mrs. M. L.
Shepherd wore slinky parchment satin.
P. W. Tewkesbury brought his daughter,
Mrs. Turner, who wore a pale-blue
coat, a black gown and a monocle. Mrs.
Guy Moore was in white. Captain and
Mrs. Ernest James entertained Captain
and Mrs. E. A. Mustar, from New
Guinea; Mrs. Mustar was draped in
brown lace. Florence Counsel’s peacock
ninon was bordered with fuchsia. Beth
Mackey’s cream gown showed straw-
berry flounces under the train and hem.
Even the most militant of small boys
got all the noise he wanted at the Ser-
vices’ Tattoo. There were guns, batteries
and bombs, a display of drill, jumping
over hurdles and a mounted attack by
Light Horsemen. Motor-cycle dispatch-
riders did some clever tricks balanced
on one leg or arm, and a sidecar pas-
senger removed and replaced a wheel
while the outfit was in motion. “Pages
from the Past” produced some quaint
drill to the tune of “Sweet Dreamland
Faces” by red-coated, moustached sol-
diers. A bunch of bearded soldiers with
drawn swords and bristling muskets
showed a tender concern for their
officer. During an attack they let him
hide like a scared rabbit in the midst of
a nest of muskets and drawn swords.
Such was the custom of those days.
This is a Broothorn portrait of Mrs.
H. M. Wrigley, one of the vice-presidents
of the Air Force Wives and Mothers’
Association. Wing-Commander Wrigley
was an organising officer of the recent
Air Force pageant at Laverton, and has
gone to Sydney to help organise the
pageant at Richmond.
Wintry weather persists—the day of
P.L.C. Old Collegians’ garden party was
like most days of this November, quite
in keeping with the snow falling on Mt.
Hotham, Mt. Donna Buang and along the
Kiewa River Valley. Past pupils were wel-
comed to their Alma Mater by a crack-
ling fire within the entrance hall, and by
Mrs. F. W. Kitchen, her cream roses
held next a jade dress; Mrs. R. R.
Isaacs, whose blue delphiniums were
beauteous against her pluckily-worn
floral chiffons; and by the principal and
Mrs. W. Gray. There were speeches
from the dais, flanked with gum saplings
and a decorative ledge of azaleas. After-
wards tea was handed around to the
swirling of pipes from the garden, and
everybody sauntered up to the studio for
a peep at the present girls’ handicraft.
They excel at bookbinding, and with
handlooms have produced, among other
articles, very attractive scarves and sports
belts. There was also tennis to watch—
a match between present and past pupils
for the Kellet Cup. Among those who
renewed old associations was Miss Jose-
phine Paterson, who took her place on
a school form on the first day the col-
lege was opened. Present also were
Frances Fraser, a compiler of the Cen-
tenary Gift Book; Mrs. I. L. Abbott,
in a tweedy green suit; Mrs. Paul
Wischer; Mrs. Colin Macdonald, with
a bunch of white daisies upon her black
coat; and Mrs. E. T. Coutts. Alma Sil-
vester struck a bright note with a tomato
woollen suit and cap. Special guests
were representatives of affiliated schools
of Melbourne and Geelong.
Peggy Creswell and H. D. Thompson
waived the present fashion of afternoon
weddings and exchanged their promises
as the twinkly lights threw into relief
the stained-glass windows of St. John’s,
loorak. Over the bride’s ivory satin
gown, cut with a Vandyck peak at the
high waistline, there flowed a beautiful
old lace veil (it was worn by a bride
200 years ago), lent by Mrs. Bert Grice.
The bride’s sister, Mrs. lan Mackeddie,
Betty Thompson and Gwen Weir
attended in buttercup chiffon with forget-
me-not's wedged under the brims of their
precariously balanced little saucer hats.
Electrical-Commander and Mrs. F. G.
Creswell entertained afterwards at No. 9.
Madame Wilkinson of the severe coif-
fure and the warm smile is pictured here
by Dickinson-Monteath. She is French
by birth, and after 10 years in Australia
speaks fluent English with an attractive
accent. Madame, who is the wife of
H. L. Wilkinson, of Brighton, is interested
in painting and music; her soprano
voice is well known in Melbourne. She
was on the committee of the Aero Club
Ball, where she entertained a party of
guests in a black garment which swathed
her neck and shoulders with plum-
bordered black velvet.
From Melbourne and from station
homes in the Western District cars came
to the Presbyterian Church, Mortlake,
for the marriage of Jean, only daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. Lionel Weatherly, to
Charles Luckock. The bride’s cream
satin gown swept into a long train
beneath a veil of rose-point lace, which
was caught under the chin and fell with
a quaint, cape-like effect over the
shoulders. Two small ’maids, Roma
Chomley and Pauline Kelly, preceded the
trio of attendants, Valerie Palmer, Mary
Guy Smith and Lome Hood, who rustled
flower-embroidered organdie, while their
hands were occupied with bunches of
cornflowers to match the chaplets in
their hair. The bride’s parents enter-
tained at Woolongoon, where a decora-
tive wedding bell was suspended over the
bridal table.
Melbourne Centenary Homes Exhibi-
tion, organised by local architects, was
opened at Myer’s last week in the presence
of 300, mostly women, with a fair sprink-
ling of feminine intelligentsia, by Min-
ister of Public Works Jones. The designs
were of a remarkably high standard, in-
dicating that the efficiency of the archi-
tect has well kept pace with the efficiency
of the builder. A large proportion of
the elevations showed a distinctly
modernistic influence, and it appears
likely that the Melbourne of the future
will bear some resemblance to Moscow
or Vienna. There were half a dozen
complete interiors shown with furnish-
ings complete—two, by Fred Ward and
Mrs. J. F. Chambers, a local air-woman,
being striking examples of harmonising
color and graceful design. One of these
rooms consisted wholly of Australian
materials, even to the chair fabrics.
At present the most interesting hap-
pening in Melbourne is the centenary
golf tournament at Metropolitan. British
and American players have praised the
organisation of the V.G.A., and say
that arrangements are being carried out
without a hitch. Competitors have clear
runs without the hold-ups that often
occur in big overseas matches, while the
well-controlled galleries are big enough
to put them on their mettle. All the
tees and greens are roped off, and detach-
ments of officials are so organised that
there is always a pair of men with ropes
well ahead of the vanguard of the gal-
lery which comes down the fairway at
a hand-gallop after each drive. Attached
to nearly every champion’s golf-bag is
an outsize in gaily-striped beach um-
brellas which comes into use when it
rains. There’s a noticeable jump back-
wards into slacks instead of plus-fours ;
most of the knitted sweaters are sub-
dued in tone —some are black —and there
are as many felt hats as caps. Most of
the players have snappy zip-fastened pro-
tectors for their woods, but J. Beaumont
Pease is satisfied with little knitted top-
knots in bright stripes. Jo Ezar has a
crop of berets ; Sarazen and Kirkwood
usually play hatless.
Last year Sarazen became intensely
air-minded, took flying lessons and had
actually ordered a ’plane, but an air trip
with Joe Kirkwood down to South
America damped his ardor, and he is
now satisfied with train travelling. It
was a comfortable Pan-Pacific ’plane,
but 20,000 miles in 40 days and about
20 exhibition matches were somewhat
wearying. One of the incidents of the
trip was at a stopping place where a very
fat passenger embarked. His weight
was so much in excess of the average
that Sarazen and Kirkwood had to leave
their heavy bags of clubs and have them
sent on to the next town.
Several of the visiting American
golfers have brought young, attractive
wives with them. Mrs. Sarazen is very
charming. She has fair hair and blue
eyes; she loves all kinds of sport, and
when she and her Gene take a spell
from travelling for exhibition matches
they revel in the home life of their farm
in Connecticut. There they grow their
own poultry, fruit and vegetables, and
bottle their own tomato juice, considered
a necessity at every American meal.
They are both keen contract-bridge
players.
Paul Runyan, captain of the American
team, and his brunette wife spend seven
months of the year at their home in
White Plains. Even more than travelling
Mrs. Runyan enjoys riding holidays in
the mountains and surfing vacations in
Florida. The couple had a Ryder Cup
trip to England and Scotland in 1933,
when they travelled with the Sarazens
and the Shutes.
Mrs. Harry Cooper is experiencing
her first trip out of the States. She
comes from Los Angeles, and since her
marriage has lived, when not travelling,
in Chicago. She plays golf “sometimes,”
but prefers riding. She has often visited
Hollywood studios, and knows the inner-
most secrets of the jungle filled with
savage monsters where Tarzan of the
Apes performed his acrobatics.

BY APPOINTMENT TO H.R.H. THE PRINCE OF WALES
All the young American wives are
accomplished knitters ; not only jumpers
and berets are produced, but frocks
made piece by piece and afterwards
sewn together.
Lord Milne opened the most important
philatelic exhibition ever held in the
Southern Hemisphere. King George is
patron of the Philatelic Society, and King
Carol of Roumania has presented three
prize medals. Lent by an American
collector is a 2d. Mauritius stamp insured
for £5OOO. The story goes that the en-
graver, who was the local watchmaker,
in 1847 made a mistake by putting
“Post Office” on the dies instead of “Post
Paid,” thus making the stamps valueless
for postal purposes. Of the 500 printed
some were used for invitations to a ball
at Government House at Port Louis.
The rest were destroyed. There are a
Van Diemen’s Land specimen, valued
at £5OO, and many air-mail stamps of
large dimensions. The Russians also
cover an extensive amount of envelope.
Among their most interesting exhibits are
a Volga Relief Famine issue and an
oblong stamp, illustrated with a balloon,
which commemorates Professor Picard’s
record ascent.
At the Housewives’ Association con-
ference in Melbourne Mrs. A. W. Bow-
man told a neat one. Finding some
blankets labelled “pure wool,” she
bought them, only to discover that they
contained cotton. When she protested,
the shopkeeper explained that the wool
in them was “pure wool.”
Miss E. J. Charlwood has retired from
journalism after 41 years, which, in Aus-
tralia, must be something like a record.
Miss Charlwood did no pen-pushing dur-
ing the Duke of Gloucester’s stay in Mel-
bourne, but she knows quite a lot about
royal visits, having recorded three of
them. She has beautiful grey hair and
a gentle expression upon regular features
which the years have touched but lightly.
ALICE.
“Mrs. Reginald Hargreaves, for .whom Lewis
Carroll wrote ‘Alice In Wonderland, is dead at tne
age of 82.”— Cable.
We went with Alice, hand in hand,
Into a merry fairyland . ,
Where child thoughts glad adventures gamed,
By careworn reason unrestrained.
And Alice, though she’s dead and gone,
Must live, still leading on and on
A strange procession, young and old,
Into the lands where whimsies hold.
Grey grandsires love again to stray
Where children dance upon their way,
Enjoying with delightful eyes
Old memories and their new surprise.
Ah, Alice, fortunate indeed,
Still as a dreaming child you lead—
And shall when ages new are gone—
That glad procession gaily on!

SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Socially Adelaide is very quiet'. The
Melbourne Cup and centenary holiday-
makers are mostly back again, but there
is a lull-before-Christmas feeling in the
air, and parties are few and far between.
Great excitement ensued when the air-
race contestants visited Adelaide. Jimmy
Melrose had a tremendous reception
from the crowd on the day of his arrival,
and the following day was given a civic
greeting at the Town Hall, which was
crowded out. After the public affair the
acting-Mayoress (Mrs. D. Dunstan) was
hostess at morning-tea. The flier’s rela-
tives, headed by knight John Melrose,
were well represented.
The Memorial Hall at St. Peter’s Col-
lege was crowded when the young hope-
fuls of the Preparatory School presented
three plays. The young son of the
Harding-Brownes shone as Mary Stuart,
and the Grenfell Prices’ boy made a
success of the coy part of Princess Cara-
way. There was another outcrop of
youthful histrionics when the Junior
Theatre players, mere babes, under the
direction of Brenda Kekwick, interpreted
poems and little plays at a matinde at
Stow Hall, when the mothers sat round
staggered at their offsprings’ ability.
Pattie Verco, who is to marry Alec
Angus next month, entertained about 60
girl friends at the Wentworth, as her
wedding will be very quiet. Pink and
pale-blue larkspur and pink roses deco-
rated, and the young hostess greeted her
guests in carmine-and-white-striped crepe
de Chine.
Marion Lunn, of Norwood, known to
her friends as Brownie, has won the Ross
Smith trophy for flying this year. She
completed her course at the same time as
young James Melrose, and has just
passed the final test for flying blind.
WESTRALIA.
Perth Golf Club opened the portals
of its clubhouse for the first dance of
its career. Rainbow lights twinkled over
the grounds and in the sitting-out mar-
quee, and balloons and flags lent color
to the verandahs and lounge where the
dancers gyrated. Mrs. Hubert Evans
made a good approach in clinging black
chiffon velvet; Mrs. Donald Smith
tee’d up in black Chantilly lace ; Mrs.
Eustace Cohen’s black satins swung a
good length on the floor ; Mrs. Campbell-
Egan made a mixed double of black-
and-white-checked taffetas; and Mrs.
Evan Saw was there in fairway-green
peau d’ange lace.
For generations the distaff side of Mrs.
C. O. Tebbutt’s family has worn a pair
of earrings, composed of tiny gold leaves
of old workmanship, at their comings-
of-age and their weddings. This tradi-
tion was faithfully carried on by
Gwenyth Tebbutt at her marriage to
John Hicks at St. George’s Cathedral;
(he heirlooms were hung in each end of
the pearl halo which held in place the
filmy tulle billowing to the end of her
trained shimmering magnolia satins.
Peggy James and Mavis Bettsworth
trailed in her wake with wreaths and
garlands of yellow marguerites, accoutre-
ments to sweeping, lime-green chiffons.
Mr. and Mrs. Tebbutt, she nodding
ospreys above raspberry ripple velvet, ex-
tended welcoming hands at the Y.A.L.
Peggy Stone kept a tryst with Cyril
Ryan at St. Mary’s Cathedral. Her blue
delphiniums were held against silver-
threaded blush-pink georgette, a-drip with
tulle and topped by a wide pink pedaline.
Sister Dorothy undid the glove in pastel
floral chiffon and a drooping parchment
hat.
The touring English schoolgirls had a
full programme for their sojourn by the
Swan. Lunch at the Uni. as guests of
Chancellor James and his lady was fol-
lowed by tea with Warden Law at St.
George’s College. An inspection of
Mundaring Weir came after a picnic
lunch and swim at National Park. Morn-
ing-tea at Government' House was the
preliminary to a tennis tournament, and
the laying of a wreath on the War
Memorial was followed in the afternoon
by tea and a swim at Perth College.
Miss Thompson stole away from her
charges to a tea given in her honor at
the Karrakatta Club by Mrs. C. H. E.
Manning.
Genuine gowns of the “Gay ’Nineties”
and artistic colorful settings marked the
Rep. Club’s performance of “The Im-
portance of Being Earnest.” Under Mrs.
Goyne Miller’s producing eye Mrs. R. A.
Cameron rustled her taffetas to a nicety.
Joy Fuller and Mabel Starr were de-
lightfully nineteenth-century ; Cyril Riley
wore his black-edged accessories with
suitable gravity, and Jerry Ruse’s “Bun-
burying” netted a shoal of laughs.
The J. L. B. Weirs’ dance at their
home in Claremont served the dual pur-
pose of celebrating daughter Zoe’s
coming-of-age and announcing her en-
gagement to Frank Venn, of Bunbury.
TASMANIA.
The Artillery Ball filled the big drill-
hall at Anglesea Barracks. Battalion
colors, red and blue, figured in the deco-
rations. The official group included Col.
and Mrs. Whitham, Lieut.-Commander
F. W. and Mrs. Heriot, Lieut.-Col. S. G.
and Mrs. Gibson, Major and Mrs. Wil-
liams, Major and Mrs. Perkins, Major
Rourke, Major H. W. and Mrs. Strutt
and Major and Mrs. Gray. Mrs. Whit-
ham was in lace and georgette; Mrs.
Heriot in red crepe.
The Horticultural Society had hard
luck on its show day, a hotfish gale elect-
ing to blow from early dawn. Luckily
most of the roses had been picked the
night before and didn’t show the strain,
but some of the other cut flowers suf-
fered.
In aid of the Free Kindergarten, Laun-
ceston’s young folk engineered a Hallow-
e’en dance at the Crystal Palais, where
decorations were spiders, witches astride
broomsticks, black cats and 13’s. At
midnight a group of witches, with caul-
dron, arrived and gave the incantation
scene from “Macbeth.” This was fol-
lowed by a gruesome skeleton dance, the
lights being dimmed and only a spotlight
turned on the dancers.
New Norfolk, with its spring greenery '
and old-fashioned church, made a lovely
setting for the wedding of Norah Shoo-
bridge and W. A. Lawrie. The tall,
handsome bride looked her best in her
lace dress, princess in style, with a long
train. The full tulle veil fell from under
a little silver lame cap, and she carried
a bouquet of lilies-of-the-valley. Three
’maids followed: sister Mollie Shoobridge,
Joan Shoobridge (cousin) and Gwen
Courthope. Their frocks of white chiffon
had a scattered design of blue, with long
trailing skirts, high neckline in front,
and rather low square backs. _ Little
coolie hats in white taffeta with blue
flowers clustered under the brims topped
the frocks. At the reception at Glenora,
the bride’s home, about 170 guests sat
down in a marquee on the lawn. Flowers
were everywhere in masses, and the day
was one of the most perfect in a
treacherous week.
Miss Henty-Summers, who came from
London to be present at the centenary
celebrations as a representative of the
Henty pioneers, made a short visit to
the Speck, and linked up with old friends
and a few relatives.
Nancy Swan, Lindisfarne, and Geof-
fry Minton Taylor have announced their
engagement.

Grainger
on jazz
and So On
Like most visit-
ing virtuosi,
Perc y Grainger
has praised j azZj
thus causing the
stock of the
crooners and the saxophonists to rise
sharply. He further gladdened the hearts
of the multitude by saying that Beet-
hoven’s music was designed to be
played in cafes to help the process of
digestion; that only the unmusical
musicians objected to jazz, because it
was “too serious for them” ; and that
“jazz might include the polyphony of
Bach, the liveliness of Beethoven and the
delicacy of Debussy.”
I should like to be instructed as to
how this can be. Grainger knows per-
fectly well what the true constituents
of jazz are, or he wouldn’t be able to
use it so astutely in his own composi-
tions. He knows what the constituents
of the music of Beethoven and Bach are,
or he wouldn’t be able to play them. So
presumably he knows that Beethoven’s
music can and does include syncopation
and that jazz does not and cannot in-
clude Beethoven without ceasing to be
jazz, since the part cannot contain the
whole, in music any more than in
Euclid. It seems to me that one might
as wefl say that a black-and-white out-
line of the objects in “Las Meninas” in-
cludes all of Velasquez.
Grainger also remarked that the oldest
music and the newest music were the
purest music and that Bach and his
confreres wrote the music of decadence.
This seems to me one of those half-
truths which are more deceiving than a
downright falsehood. Banging on a
kerosene-tin produces pure sound, and
there are in Bach and Beethoven, no
doubt, sundry impurities. But how much
else of pure gold is in them?
Grainger also stated that music was
the natural speech of all, appealing more
to the heart emotions and less to the
brain. The Malays place the seat of
the emotions in the liver and the Chinese
locate it in the stomach, and this is just
as plausible as to place it in a hollow,
muscular organ whose habit of rhyth-
mically contracting serves to keep the
blood in circulation. And I strongly
doubt whether music is any more a
natural form of expression for every-
body than painting or writing. A bird
sings naturally, though it gets no further
than a bar or two, cannot sing in chorus
or act solo in a bird concerto ; a child
has to be taught to sing or play the
piano, just as it has to be taught to paint
and write, and the notion that a child
can paint a good picture or write a good
poem spontaneously has been disproved
by the practical tests of psychologists.
Finally, Grainger told us that our
musical education was sadly deficient —
which is true —and said that we ought
to hear more Javanese music.
I wonder if he has heard much
Javanese music? For some years 1 was
lulled to sleep by it nightly; I dwelt
within biscuit-throw of a native kam-
pong. This music had no beginning and
no end. The orchestrions drifted out by
one's and twos to have a spot of cocoa-
nut-milk whenever they felt so disposed.
Their playing not only put their audi-
ences to sleep but had an invincibly
soporific effect on the players. Some-
times a whole row of them would be
seen to be nodding together: then they
would suddenly wake up and give their
gandrongs a terrific bang or rattle their
alang-alangs with tremendous vigor, only
to fall asleep again. These were the only
occasions when I could discern a cres-
cendo or a crisis in their monotonous
cacophony.
Not that the music they made had no
seductiveness. It had the charms of a
"Flies,” an Edmund Blampied drypoint—shown at the Lawson Gallery, Sydney.
babbling brook or wind in the palms or
a marble being rolled around in a frying-
pan, diversified by an occasional acci-
dental earthquake But it had no more
musical significance than the repetition
of “Om mani padme hum” by a choir
of somnolent Buddhist priests, full of
rice and curried vegetables, has intellec-
tual significance.
It may be true, as Grainger says, that
Debussy was inspired to alter his style by
the influence of the music of Java, but
composers pick up hints from all sorts
of sources, including the noise of engines
shunting: it is the usq they put them to
that matters. A Javanese origin would
probably account for the extraordinary
dulness of much of Debussy’s music.
As a result of the impact of Grainger’s
picturesque personality on an impres-
sionable public via the press, I foresee
an outbreak of jazz concertos, sonatas,
arias and oratorios as lamentably inept
as Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue,” with,
possibly, a season of symphonic con-
certs by the Sultan of Djokja’s gamelang.
And genuinely brainless composers will
be at a premium.
Nobody would deplore this more than
Grainger, who is a serious musician with
more than an ordinary belief that the
artist should educate, and not merely
titillate, the public.
KRAKEN.
A Critic Dyspeptic .
Yes! The landlady’s daughter had a
python on a plate;
It wagged its wicked head about and
hissed a hymn of hate :
I saw her put it in her mouth and calmly
masticate.
But no one seemed to notice her extra-
ordinary meals;
The boarders plied their knives and forks
on writhing conger eels:
To their degraded appetites the crudest
dish appeals.
They gave me snakes and ladders and
some dominoes for tea.
They knew that such a bill of fare would
disagree with me.
Although my stomach’s very weak they’ve
no benignity.
And, when the slavey entered with the
gravy on a tray,
/ found the dish was full of squids in
carnival array;
I grabbed a pair of table knives to
frighten them away.
But everyone screamed “Murder” when
they saw me with the knives,
And portly, pompous boarders ran and
hid behind their wives;
And burly men went very white and
scurried for their lives.
They called the stolid policemen in, and
dumped me in a car,
And shanghaied me to Gladesville, where
the mental patients are :
The doctor said dyspepsia had sent my
wits ajar.

A Society
For Younger
Artists
It is an often-
heard cry, in Syd-
ney at any rate,
that the Younger
Artists do not get
a fair hearing. In
most of the big exhibitions, however,
their work is well-placed, and the press
is only too willing to give it even more
notice than it actually earns. Still, the
young remain discontented, wallowing in
self-pity without moving a finger to help
themselves.
Their work, they claim, hangs un-
noticed and unbought. The remedy for
these ills lies within their own hands, but
they are either too blind to see it or too
lazy to put it into effect. That remedy
can be briefly summed up. It is neces-
sary for them to form a new society,
unattached to any of the established art
groups.
The Royal Art Society, as is generally
recognised, has been moribund for many
years. The Society of Artists, when it
first broke from that already decaying
body, had the vitality of all such revolu-
tionary movements and carried with it
that day. Now that it has become the
fashionable art faction of Sydney, it is
as stolid and dull as the parent body
from which it broke. The work exhibited
at its yearly exhibitions is admittedly of
an infinitely superior technical quality to
any seen elsewhere; nevertheless, it is
heavy and lifeless, and even the young
blood, which it is wise enough to nur-
ture most carefully, fails to put any
life into its tired carcass. The society
merely succeeds in reducing that ichor
to the torpidity of its own flagging
pulse.
It is the unconscious realisation of
this that forces these cries of resentment
from vSydney’s Younger Artists, but in
the face of their futility one must be deaf
to their entreaties. They will be listened
to only when they have the courage to
follow the tradition of their forebears
and deny the parents that have nursed
them. Then, having cast their incubus
out, they may cut a place in the world
of art for themselves.
RAYMOND LINDSAY.
A State
Symphony
Orchestra
If Henri Ver-
brugghen heard
before his death
that the latest
director of the
Con. he licked
into shape had revived the N.S.W. State
Symphony Orchestra, the news would
have brightened his last days. Verbrug-
ghen held the view that every city worthy
the name should number a symphony
orchestra among its institutions, and he
left Sydney only because his orchestra,
to which he had devoted five of the best
years of his life and which under his
baton earned fame that still reverberates,
was disbanded, being deemed a too-
expensive luxury.
In the intervening 13 years there have
been various efforts to revive those past
glories—all wrecked on the rock of
finance. The Con. has always had an
orchestra of some sort, and a very useful
adjunct to other forms of teaching it
has proved, but an orchestra mainly
composed of students and whose per-
sonnel is subject to frequent changes
can never hope to equal the perform-
ances of a permanent professional band.
The establishment by the A.B.C. of a
symphony orchestra has improved the
outlook, and Dr. Edgar Bainton, as the
first performance of the players he was
able to enlist from this and other existing
organisations showed, has material to
work upon, not available in earlier years,
that sounds as if it could be developed
into a worthy instrument for the inter-
pretation of the greatest forms of music.
That the new venture will get sufficient
financial support to enable it to develop
during a period of years seems more
than a little doubtful, but if there is any
public spirit among Sydney’s allegedly
large army of music-lovers the city
won’t allow the plucky effort to perish.
A. MAJOR.
Bernard Shaw
Outmoded?
Melbourne
“Age,” comment-
ing on a pro-
duction of “Man
and Superman,” a
month or so back,
said “it was inevitable that some of those
present in the audience would suggest
that the play is dated.” On the same
show the “Herald”-commented that “time
has dulled the edge of some of its wit
and taken the sting from some of its
satire.”
It would be interesting to know which
of Shaw’s barbs has become blunted.
Is it the Ramsden family’s reception
of Violet’s supposedly illegitimate child?
It would be a comfort to know that the
“Herald” proprietary had educated its
public to such a degree that Shaw’s tilt-
ing at the Nonconformist conscience
would seem to it a superfluous flog-
ging of a donkey long dead. Perhaps
the “Herald” found Ann as the female
expression of the Life Force behind the
times.
Actually, in “Man and Superman” we
have an admirable picture of how people
act the conventions about themselves.
Such pictures we have in plenty—they
are given in about a dozen talkies a
week —but in all of them the conven-
tions are stated in their own terms.
Hence, when the conventions change the
picture becomes out of date. In “Man
and Superman” Shaw stands outside the
conventions and places them beside the
underlying realities. Therefore, though
his play may not live as a great work of
art, it can no more be dated than “King
Lear.”

There are sure-
ness of touch and
graceful sense of
color and com-
position in .the
water - colors of
Gladys on show at Mac-
quarie Galleries (Sydney). The
lady delights in depicting a vast
stretch of country seen from a
height, finding the distance a very
effective background. Examples
in this vein are “The Windsor
Plain” and some pictures from
Mount Wilson. About the pret-
tiest thing in the show is “Kurra-
jong Heights Village.”
Carlyle Jackson exhibits land-
scapes in water-color at New-
man’s Gallery (Melbourne), some
of them deft and pleasing, and all
revealing workmanship. Golden
poplars are favorites of this artist,
and he has made good use of
them in three of his best works.
Most of the photographs in the
International Exhibition of Pro-
fessional Photography at Mel-
bourne Athenaeum are portraits,
and the artists reveal excellent
judgment in their choice of sitters.
With the sort of face they want half the
battle is won ; the other half consists in so
placing the sitter that the lights and shades
are just in the right place. Australian
exhibitors achieve a high standard.
Adelaide Art Gallery, entrusting Hans
Heysen with a thousand or two to lay
out at his discretion in Europe, has
acquired its biggest addition of this cen-
tury. Anning Bell appears twice, with
a sleepy decorative girl on Albert Moore
lines and a pre-Raphaelite fantasy
modernised a conventional Christ
crowded in among women and children
of to-day. D. Y. Cameron’s mountain-
with-tarn is smooth and dim and rest-
ful; “Rotherham,” by Charles Holmes, is
an arresting study of smelters and smoke
under snow. Strang somehow manages
to paint an obvious Rossetti girl in the
hard, modern style. Stanley Anderson has
a fine crayon man’s head and a regular
“gallery picture” of paint types at a book-
stall. But James Bateman is the star ex-
hibit. From somewhere up in the air he
depicts a pretty English village, with, in
the foreground, a small cornfield being
reaped, the hardy peasantry chivying the
hares which are a by-product. Hard and
very modern, this picture repels at first
sight, but attracts on better acquaintance.
Some more moderns, a few Continental
works and a Reynolds are to follow.
Victor Cobb in his exhibition at New-
man’s Gallery, Melbourne, scarcely
touches his old and one-time favorite
medium —only three etchings are on
view, all clerical architecture. They are
excellent specimens of their sort, that of
Newman College especially. Cobb also
exhibits ten oils and five water-colors,
but it is in pencil drawings that he has
let himself loose —there are 80 of them,
mostly soundly composed and techni-
cally accomplished.

SAVED BY
AN
EARTHQUAKE
BY I.M. ROSS.
THE rattling of cow-buckets and milk-
bails stopped. The milking done,
old Malcolm McDonald whacked
Strawberry across her hindermost parts
with a piece of maunka or matai or
tanekaha or kahikatea —or it may have
been just an ordinary bit of wood. Any-
way, the holder of the Ngoewhaurimoana
Matrons’ Butter-fat Record took the hint
and ambled sedately out of the cowshed.
Old David McDonald’s work was
done; for, like all farmers in short
stories, he never was seen separating or
washing his shed. Having nothing to
do, he put his hands in his pockets, and
from his natty buckskin riding-breeches
pulled forth a large printed form.
Yes, it is—or, rather, it was —the notice
saying that his mortgagee, or mortgagor,
was foreclosing forthwith.
Tears came to the old man’s eyes, his
chest heaved convulsively, sobs rent the
air. He was weeping.
He looked out over the farm—the
farm he had carved from the virgin
bush. Yes, seventy-nine winters and
almost as many summers (several years
there hadn’t been any summer) had
passed since old McDonald, then young
McDonald, had first assaulted the virgin
bush with an axe.
Just an axe?
Well, hardly. A
half-tonof crow-
bars, spades and
mauls, a few
tons of ex- (
plosive, a team
of oxen and a
tribe of friend-
ly Maoris, the
Ngati Tai Hoa,
had helped him
a little. But the
Sedately.
Maoris were untutored savages. Few of
them had any secondary education, and
not one a degree in agriculture. With
such insurmountable difficulties the
pioneers had to battle.
And now to lose all! Though not all;
for he still had his honor and his wife.
And his wife had hers.
But ruin stared him in the face. No
wonder old Malcolm McDonald ground
Animals, etc., by Teel Scorfield.
his teeth, and no wonder the muscles
on his brown, bare, hairy arms stood out
like the muscles on the arms of the black-
smith immortalised in Milton’s immortal
parody.
THE most rigid of old Malcolm Mc-
Donald’s gallavanting Presbyterian
forebears would admit that there was
justification for the hard words that now
fell from the old man’s pallid lips. He
said, “It is circumstances such as this
which the wisest and most
provident of us could not
anticipate; it is circum-
stances such as this that
cause a man seriously to
question whether a strict
adherence to the forms and
observances of Presbyterian-
ism carries invariably with it
its due reward of material
success.”
Strong words! Such words
showed the old man’s per-
plexity and despair.
Plunged deep in perplexity
and despair as he was, he
was roused by something
that came floating on the
wind into the cowshed. It
was the silver cadence of
girlish laughter. No, you are
Mortgage.
wrong—it was his wife.
His daughter was where you would
expect her to be. She was down the far
cow-paddock courting the struggling
farmer next door. This struggling farmer
was a fine specimen, a typical All Black,
six-foot-nine and nineteen-stone-six,
solid in the tight and fast in the loose.
No wonder Gertrude loved him.
He was struggling, not against Ger-
trude, but against bankruptcy, fate and
the time-payment system. Often he had
said, “Gertrude, if they would derate
farm lands and declare a moratorium on
time-payment debts, and subsidise the
export of dairy produce, we could get
married.”
Such men, willing to face anything,
are loved by the women of Maoriland.
Such a woman was Gertrude ; and she
spurned the rich suitor who threatened
to foreclose forthwith over her father’s
head.
BUT revons-nous an moutons, or, to
translate the witty French phrase,
let’s get back to the cowshed.
We left it as the girlish laugh was
floating in. It had floated from the
house, floated across the home cow-
paddock, floated half a mile up the hill,
and now floated to the ears of old Mal-
colm McDonald. Its elfin cadence
stopped old McDonald as if he had been
struck by a tornado. Such is the gentle
power of a woman’s voice.
“It’s Emeraldi,” he said.
He was right. A man living in the
vast, illimitable spaces of the cow-coun-
try learns to know his wife’s voice as
a city man, thrown constantly into his
wife’s company, never does.
And Malcolm began to think as he
began to run towards the old home-
stead. But although age had reduced
his speed he arrived at the house before
he had thought of anything. Alter all,
he was but a simple farmer.
He burst into the kitchen.
While he stood there collecting his
thoughts and trying to think, there was
spread before him a tableau, or a drama
was unfolded before him. (Both phrases
have the approval of the best authors,
and only a very subtle distinction lies
between them.)
There stood his own dear
wife Emeraldi. She had not
altered since he left her the
night before.
BEFORE her was a big
man. About size five.
His florid face, floral waist-
coat and patent-leather rid-
ing-boots stamped him as
something unusual He was
a villain.
Such was Michaelmas
Archibald Cadwallader. He
was one of the richest farm-
ers about Ngoewhauri-
moana.
He had made his money
in a way more nefarious
than his present scheme to
marry the beautiful, proud Gertrude,
who could milk her fifteen cows morn
and eve and heave a hayfork all day.
Cadwallader bought cows which had
been condemned as unfit for
the carnivora’s consumption
by the authorities in the big
city zoos. These lean wretches
he fed on a mixture of straw
and baking-powder. Then he
stood them in the warm sun.
When the hot rays permeated
the grossly-deceived animals’
vitals the hollows between
their ribs filled and swelled,
and the bony projections of
their hips and haws sank into
gaseous rotundity, Michael-
mas Archibald Cadwallader
sold the beasts to the freezing
companies as prime ox. The
cad! So he became a bloated
All-Black.
capitalist. He was able to in-
dulge his luxurious tastes and extrava-
gant hobbies.
He became Maoriland’s leading phi-
latelist.
WHEN old Malcolm McDonald heard
this he was suspicious.
He went home and looked up his
tionary. He read right through “F.”
When he did not find the word his sus-
picions grew darker. But with that innate
sense of justice which is the heritage of
Cow.
every Briton he did not con-
demn Cadwallader. He kept
his suspicions to himself.
The next time he visited
Ngoewhaurimoana he went
to the public library. He
spent four days reading
through “F” in the “Oxford Dictionary.”
He did not find the word. His suspicions
were now a certainty. Cadwallader was
something unprintable!
And so Scotch perseverance and acu-
men revealed to Gertrude’s father the
nature of the villain who sought her
hand.
MEANWHILE, as old Malcolm stood
collecting his thoughts, the tableau
before him translated itself into a talkie.
Cadwallader l\ad just urged his suit to
the lovely Gertrude. The laugh was
Mrs. McDonald’s note of scorn. At such
terrific soul-searing moments we notice
the most trivial things. Old Malcolm
McDonald’s most vivid impression of
that moment was Cadwallader’s patent-
leather riding-boots; and involuntarily
he said, “De rigeur atque de trop.”
Stung to the quick by the scornful
laugh and the biting, ironical -quotation
from Horace, Cadwallader shouted,
“Well, I foreclose on the Monday fol-
lowing the first Sunday in Lent,” and
he turned to storm out of the room.
He never stormed out of that room!
As he turned the ground rocked be-
neath his feet. Gaping cavities yawned,
walls swayed, loud noises emanated from
nowhere, a cup fell off the sideboard,
trees crashed to earth, the cat yeowled
in shrill terror as the falling cup con-
nected with its head. Windows rattled,
and the fair face of Nature was dis-
guised with cataclysmic rage as great
billows of the land, like billows of the
sea, rolled across the country and burst
in mud and
multitudinous
fragments of
rock against the
side of the
sturdy farm-
house.
“It feels like
an earthquake,”
said old Mal-
colm McDonald
as he pulled at
his pipe.
It was.
A big one.

f ) GOVERNOR. LACHLAN MACQUARJE. ) A^Tj
Since the Days of Macquarie
During the term of Governor Lachlan Macquarie, trade
in Australia was largely carried on by barter. Rum was
extensively employed as money, and the coinage,
mainly Spanish dollars, was quite inadequate for
currency requirements.
The imperative need for a satisfactory currency was
officially recognised, and towards the end of 1816 a
meeting of settlers was convened "to take into con-
sideration the present state of the colonial currency
and what would be the consequence of an immediate
sterling circulation."
This meeting affirmed the desirability of establishing
"a public colonial bank." The Governor's approval was
obtained and the Bank of New South Wales' opened in
April, 1817.
Established to stabilise the currency in Australia, the
Bank of New South Wales has consistently provided
those essential banking facilities which have made
possible the rapid expansion of the country's trade and
industry.
For 117 years the Bank has rendered unparalleled
service to the community. It has constantly extended
its activities to meet the growing needs of the country,
and to-day, through over 720 branches, offers the most
complete banking service in Australia and New Zealand.

—were not perturbed. No. Many a
time and oft as children, when their
parents were busy carving a home out
of the virgin bush, their cradles had
been placed under the shade of a giant
kauri or tanekaha or kumara or any
other handy sort of tree, and there,
soothed by the songs of tuis, tutaras and
kahawais, they had been rocked to sleep,
not by the soulful hand of a mother but
by the delirium tremens of Mother
Earth.
They were not afraid; but what of
Cadwallader?
His florid face was livid as he grov-
elled on the floor. His floral waistcoat
was torn to ribbons by the blast of air
that accompanied the ’quake.
All his troubles were not yet over.
When he went outside to mount his steed
the frightened beast had flown or fled.
Cadwallader had to walk from Mc-
Donald’s farm, in the heart of the bush,
to that lonely outpost of civilisation,
Ngoewhaurimoana. Four and a half
miles along a second-class clay road in
patent-leather riding-boots. The boots
were ruined. The machinations of the
Mother.
wicked bring
little but in-
dignity upon
themselves.
TWO days
have pass-
ed. It is now
the first Sun-
day in Lent.
Old Malcolm Mc-
Donald is uncomfort-
ably cramped on a low
seat; his furrowed
brow is leaning against
a large pad of brindled
cowhide; his brown,
bare, hairy arms, bent
at the elbow, are mov-
ing with steady rhyth-
mic force; there is a
steady swish-swish and an occasional
rattle of iron.
The scene is one dear and familiar
to all who have been born in the heart
of the virgin bush. Old Malcolm Mc-
Donald is milking. Now he has finished
milking. Unhappy man, he has milked
for the last time. To-morrow his mort-
gag-ee or -or walks in over his head.
Even the cows are sad ; they seem to
understand. They milk badly. Old Mc-
Donald is puzzled: some of the cows
he has had ever since he started farming
and not once have they failed him in
seventy years.
The milk appears strange. He exam-
ines last night’s cream. He pours the
cream out on the shed floor, being earth
it will not stain. He puts his hand into
the sticky mess and pulls out a fistful.
He looks at it closely. It is heavier and
more vividly yellow than usual. He
looks at it more closely. It is bespat-
tered with little spots of bright yellow.
Old McDonald turns to the separator ;
he pulls it to bits
and examines the
discs and spouts.
Feverish excite-
ment burns in
the old man’s
veins; he reels,
he rolls. He
faints.
The separator is
crammed chock-
full of gold dust!
There are some
phenomena seem-
ingly past all pos-
sibility of human
belief; and yet
the explanation
lies in the simple
sequence of cause
and effect—easily
to be understood
by a child. Of
Villain.
such a simple nature is the explanation
of the gold in the separator.
The earthquake of the Friday before
the first Sunday in Lent, having its epi-
centre in the Ngoewhaurimoana district,
and with an amplitude at that point of
forty feet and a frequency of eighty-
three cycles per second, had rolled up
pasture land as a housewife rolls up
carpets. Thus old McDonald’s cows,
deprived of those vitamins and proteins
which the modern, highly specialised
dairy cow knows are essential to health
and high butter-fat yield, endeavored to
supply the deficiency with the mineral
salts made available in the geological
formations exposed by the earthquake.
A quartz vein, heavily mineralised with
gold, was a prominent feature of this
formation. The mineral salts had been
assimilated by the cows, but the com-
paratively indigestible gold had passed
straight into their milk.
The McDonalds now are a rich family.
Gertrude married the struggling farmer.
He wisely gave up the struggle. They
all live in town. But the restless energy
of old McDonald—born and inured to
a life of activity—had to find an outlet.
He had gained fame as the founder and
president of the Society for the Suppres-
sion of Filatelists.
Cadwallader died of leprosy.
Linking Adult and Boyhood Drama:—
THE CATCH
By VANCE PALMER.
Pride welled up in him, carried him
away in a great cresting wave out of the
region of childhood... .But something
went unaccountably wrong.
STRIPPED of his clothing the young-
ster made for the pools that were
left in the flat ledge of rock by the
withdrawn tide. The drying limestone
was warm beneath his footsoles, the after-
noon air like silk on his skin. He gave a
barbaric shout of joy as he picked up a
length of weed fruited with salty grapes
and whirled it round his head, spraying
himself with a cool mist.
“Don’t go near the edge, old chap,”
called out the man, looking up from his
tin of bait.
“Who wants to go near the edge?”
thought the boy, sprawling on the warm
ledge and bursting one of the grapes
between his fingers.
There was enough excitement' in these
waist-deep pools where the transparent
water revealed anemones, colored
growths, circles of greenish sand. Bright,
barred fish darted from one small grotto
to another. Patterned crabs peered out
of the crevices.
At the rim of the rock’s tableland the
surf, ferocious at high tide, was growling
feebly like a tired monster, flinging up
clouds of fine spray that evaporated
before it fell. A few hundred yards away
was the crescent of bathing-beach with
a few brown figures lying about in the
sand, and behind it a handful of red-
roofed cottages were scattered among the
banksia. Far off, near the estuary,
sprawled the hotel with its balconies
and tennis court.
There was hardly a bird stirring in !
the sleepy afternoon sunlight. Even the
man, slanting his rod behind him to
throw out into deep water, seemed
drowsy and only half conscious of what
he was doing. Standing naked on the
pool’s edge, the boy watched him with
absorbed eyes—his tweeded figure, his
brown face, his curved pipe coming out
of the side of his jaw.
“Take him out for a while to the
rocks,” he had heard his mother whisper
after lunch. “He simply loves going out
with you, Brian. And it’ll be the last
chance.”
She had been droopy and quiet all
morning. Was that because Brian was
going away? He felt miserable himself
when he thought of Brian going away.
To-morrow his father would be coming
up from town, and there would be no
more picnics along the beach, no more
trips over to the sandbanks, with Brian
singing comic songs and making jokes
as he rowed and his mother looking gay
and laughing like a girl. His father

never wanted tp go out in the boat; he
slept a lot after meals, and didn’t like any
noise made about the house.
THE line whistled through the air, the
sinker falling with a plop in the deep
water beyond the furthest rock. With
his cold pipe between his teeth and his
cap pulled down over his eyes the man
settled down to wait. Across the fifty
intervening yards his voice came with
friendly brusqueness:
“How’s the water,- Leo?”
On the sand of the shallow pool the
youngster sprawled, eyes just above the
surface.
“Great. Cool ’s ice underneath.”
“Look out, and don’t get cut on the
coral, then. No casualties this time.”
Why can’t they forget about that, the
boy thought, turning over on his back?
He knew Brian was thinking of what had
happened the year before when he was
getting ready to go away. It was to see
if Brian’s little car had been taken out
of the hotel garage that he had climbed
on the verandah rails. Then his foot had
slipped, and he remembered nothing
more but the pain in his leg as his mother
ran with him across the strip of green.
Brian had had to drive them into the
doctor, and when they came back, late
at night, they knew by the light in the
house that his father was there. Angry
he had looked as he stood in the glow
of headlights by the gate, watching them
get out. It had spoilt the rest of the
holiday.
For a while, as he splashed in the sun-
bright pool, the thought of his father
hung over him like a shadow. Why did
he make everyone feel so uncomfortable
when he came? Why wasn’t he just
jolly like Brian, whistling about the place,
making kites, inventing games with the
soldier-crabs on their trips to the sand-
bank?
But the shimmering sunlight' dispersed
all such dark thoughts, scattered them on
the sunbright air. He slipped from one
pool to another, peering into the caverns
behind the swaying weeds. He turned
over the small rocks to look for cats’-
eyes and cowries. There were the money-
cowries with their strip of gold running
through the watery green, the big
Arabics, the snakes’ heads that felt like
velvet. The cardboard box he kept them
in was nearly full now, and he had to
hide it under the house because of the
smell.
“What muck’s that boy been collect-
j n g n0 w?” his father would say, sniff-
jn g roun d his bedroom on the verandah,
(He’ll be here to-morrow. Soon after
breakfast he’ll come . . . And' Brian’ll
be gone.)
pEOPLE from the boarding-houses
1 were straggling down to the beach in
their colored kimonos. They looked like
p arrc ,ts among the banksia: their twit-
tering came over faintly on the after-
noon air. On the flat ledge of rock the

Oh, just hang on and call out for me.
I won t be far away.
He took his bathing-togs and went
over to the fallen rocks that made a
screen at the base of the cliff. Respon-
sibility sat heavy on the boy as he
watched him disappear. His bare feet
were braced against the rock ; every
muscle was taut and quivering in re-
sponse to the delicate vibration of the
line in the heaving water. If only he
could get a bite before Brian came back!
Even if it were just a little one.
Brian had stripped and was moving
over to the further edge of the rocks,
where there was a tiny cove. The sun
fell on his thick, dark hair, on his
brown, chunky body. He turned some-
thing over with his bare toe, and stooped
to examine it. He stood staring at the
mossy drip from the cliff.
“Don’t come back yet,” the boy was
urging him inwardly. “You don t need
to. Don’t come back.”
The rod had gradually gone dead in
his hands. He wound it up till he felt
the weight of the sinker, and again there
came that delicate thrumming that went
tingling up his arm, setting the blood
moving around his heart. In spite of the
chill that nipped his flesh now that the
sun was dropping low, he was alive from
top to toe. Even if he didn’t catch any-
thing this would be something to tell his
mother.
“We both had a turn. While Brian
had his swim I fished off the rocks. Off
the rocks where all the men go.”
TANG of bait, of drying pools, of sun-
warmed weed. Plunk of water falling
fainter as the tide ebbed. The boy’s
arms were growing tired; his body
sagged. Suddenly there was a tug that
bent the rod double, a swish in the
water, a whistling hum as the line spun
out from the reel.
“Brian!” he yelled. “Brian! I’ve got one.”
He tripped over his own feet and
nearly fell, but hung on to the rod. In-
coherent cries sounded from his throat.
Through the corner of his eye he could
see Brian racing towards him, calling out
to him to hang on. But the rod was
bendjng as if it would break; the line
raced madly backwards and forwards
through the water.
Brian was breathing heavily above him,
snatching the rod from his hands.
“All right, old chap. Leave him to
me. Lord, you’ve hooked something big
this time.”
Letting go the rod, the boy ran down
to the edge. The fish, goggle-eyed, was
coming swirling through the water. A'
sudden jerk and it was landed, a quiver-
ing mass of silver, on the flat ledge of
rock.
Almost beside himself, the boy danced
round it.
“A whopper—isn’t it a whopper,
Brian? Bigger’n any we've had yet. It
was me caught it, wasn’t it, Brian?”
“That’s so,” the man allowed. “It was
you caught it, all right.”
“How much does it weigh?”
“About ten. Perhaps twelve . . .
Better get into your clothes now, old
chap. We’ll call it a day.”
THEY were silent on their way home
across the tide-flattened sand. The
man was abstracted, wrapped in gloomy
thought. There came an end to all such
holidays. For five years it had been
going on now, and yet Bee, though she
hated the ties that held her, shrank from
making the final break. Evasion, subter-
fuge ! Deep down she was afraid —afraid
of what her people would say, of the
uncertainties of the future, of life itself.
There was a fundamental timidity in her.
Rendered dumb by his excitement, the
boy danced ahead, turning back now and
then to look at the fish.
They were coming up the cliff to the
green flat that ran along the estuary, the
hotel with its red roof and outbuildings
standing out from the smaller cottages.
Still the boy danced ahead. He was living
for the moment when he would stagger
into the living-room with the fish in his
arms, overwhelming his mother as she
lay reading by the window.
“Oh, Leo! Whoever gave you that?”
With deliberate casualness he would say:
“It’s mine. I caught it. Brian was
fishing over an hour, but he didn’t even
get a bite.”
Pride welled up in him, carried him
away on a great cresting wave out of the
region of childhood. He went over the
scene again and again. The look of
astonishment in his mother’s eye as she
jumped up from the lounge, the way she
put her arm round his shoulder.
“Oh, Leo!”
She could never treat him as a little
boy again after this. It was the begin-
ning of a tremendous change. He would
take the oars when they went over to
the sandbank, would go off alone in the
afternoons, would stay up at night till
he wanted to go to bed. Even his father,
when he came to-morrow, would under-
stand . . .
BUT something went unaccountably
wrong. When he staggered up the
steps his mother wasn’t lying on the
lounge ; clad in a fluffy pink slip, she was
powdering her face before the bedroom
glass, and at the sound of his pattering
feet she looked out with strained, pre-
occupied eyes
“Whatever made you stay out so late,
Leo? It’s nearly six. And we’re going
over to the hotel for dinner.”
Her glance rested on the fish, strayed
to his stained shirt. Resentment choked
in his throat.
“Look!”
But her mind was far away. The last
night!
“Oh, yes, a nice cod, isn’t it? But
you shouldn’t have held it against your
clean shirt . . . See if Jessie’s in the
kitchen and tell her to clean it —then run
and change. Quick! There’s a good boy.”
Her tone was perfunctorily maternal.
“If I hadn’t got Leo’s future to con-
sider,” she was thinking.
The boy plumped out to the kitchen
and threw the snapper on the table.
Then he slouched out to the back, and
after wandering aimlessly about the yard
for a while squeezed himself in between
the garage and the palings. The kitten
smelt fish and followed him, rubbing
against his legs. He made a savage
kick at it.
Something he had never experienced
before was going on in his depth. Tur-
bulence, rebellion, lightning playing on
thunderclouds! He hadn’t even told his
mother he had caught the fish she called
a cod. He never would now.
Hardly aware he had moved, he found
himself standing by the table in the
kitchen, looking once more at the
snapper. It seemed smaller than before
—mean, somehow; its eyes had glazed,
its scales dried and lost lustre. He raised
it by the tail. It was stiff, unresponsive,
hard as a board.
“Leo! Wherever are you, Leo?” his
mother was calling him.
An impulse to assert himself broke
over him like a wave. Taking the fish
in his arms, he blundered down the steps,
out through the gate, over the strip of
green buffalo-grass behind the hotel.
The tide was coming in again now, foam-
ing up against the crumbling banks of
the estuary where the boats were moored.
He stood for a while there white-lipped,
then threw the fish in with a splash.
“What’s that, son?” said a fisherman,
looking up from his bailing. “Gone bad
on you, eh?”
“Gone bad,” he tried to repeat.
But there was a bubble between him
and his voice. Dry-eyed, his feelings
tied up in a hard knot, he watched the
fish being caught up in the backwash
and carried away.

Students now offer the
answer to thesepuzzling
questions: why
puppies eat mud; 1
why dogs'favour- *
ite delicacy is a
bone. What we
have learned from
our four - legged
pets about fighting
tooth decay. What people must do
that dogs
do not.
mmmk
wr.
An attractive smile must
depend on glistening, healthy
teeth. Many women forget
that fact until too late.
Breeders of show
dogs see that the
dog's diet contains
plenty of minerals
and vitamins.
How an artist of a
century or more
ago would depict
the tortures of
toothache. '
AS everyone knows, the wildest de-
light of any true epicure in the dog
world is a huge, juicy bone. After
the meat is eaten, the bone itself is
chewed and chewed, and that, in the
opinion of many people, is one reason
why dogs have good teeth. Bones are
mainly composed of calcium and phos-
phorus, the same minerals which build
strong, hard teeth. Many believe that
the dog’s appetite for bones is merely
nature’s scheme for obtaining the
minerals needed.
Human beings should include an
abundance of mineral-containing foods
in their diet also. Milk, cod liver oil,
and cheese are especially rich in tooth-
and bone-building minerals and the
necessary vitamins.
Of course, chewing hard substances
like bone also exercises the dog’s gums
and keeps them healthy and may offer
one more explanation of a dog’s freedom
from tooth decay.
The active cause of decay in the
human mouth, according to dental
authorities, is acid-producing bacteria.
These germs cause fermentation of the
food particles that remain on teeth and
under gums. In so doing, acids are
formed which start decay. The germs
which produce these acids live in the
coating of film which covers teeth. This
film forms after every meal. It creeps
into every tiny crevice. Film actually
glues germs to the teeth. For years we
have studied ways of removing film.
Recently a discovery was made in The
Pepsodent Company’s laboratories—a
new and different cleansing and polish-
ing material. This new material is twice
as soft and therefore a great deal safer
than the polishing material generally
used in tooth pastes.
This new cleansing material is con-
tained in Pepsodent Tooth Paste exclu-
sively. Because it is softer and therefore
safer, Pepsodent is looked upon as the
modern standard of safety in tooth
pastes. At the same time it stands un-
surpassed in removing film and polishing
enamel brilliantly.

My Political
Life
By W. A.HOLMAN
UNDER the leadership of James
McGowen, the Labor party of N.
S. Wales took office towards the
close of 1910.
It had been in existence for nineteen
years, thirteen of which had been spent
as a third party and six as a direct Oppo-
sition. It was now for the first time to
form a Ministry. The
constitution of the
movement provided for
the election of Minis-
ters by the entire Par-
liamentary party. This
process was at once
gone through, and the
team resulting was, on
the whole, a very strong
one.
Our leader was then
in his full vigor and
quite equal to the de-
mands of his new posi-
tion. In Flowers we
had a solid trade-union-
ist of the English
school who had been
for some years flatter-
ingly known as The
Czar, in recognition of
the extraordinary skill
with which he had gov-
erned the executive side
of the organisation, in
Edden and Donald
Macdonell we had two

turesque personalities from the trades-
union world. Neilsen and Trefle were
acknowledged experts on land and settle-
ment questions, and the rest of us were
among the most active fighters and propa-
gandists that the movement possessed.
Cann was not selected, but he was ob-
viously designated for the Speakership,
to which he was shortly afterwards ap-

pointed. The one serious fault charge-
able against the selection was the omis-
sion of Dacey, one of the ablest brains
the movement had ; his defeat was one
of the untoward accidents of the ballot.
WE were taking office with a majority
of two only. None of us had had
any previous Ministerial ex-
perience. We represented a
spirit in public affairs still
but little known, and gener-
ally distrusted. An early
and inglorious defeat was,
naturally, predicted for us.
As a matter of fact, the
Government thus formed
lasted for nearly six years
until the great conscription
struggle of 1916, when a
portion of it merged in the
National Coalition Govern-
ment, which carried on for
nearly another four.
The movement had grown
up into these dimensions
from small beginnings.
Originally it had been a
blending together of the
Socialists of 1890 —a small
but able group—the Single
Taxers who had come into
existence since Henry
George’s only visit to out-
shores, and such trade-
unionists as cared to enrol
as members of the Labor
League.
McGowen, with a little
I trouble.
Incidentally, most of its members were,
in fact, trades-unionists, but there was no
casual or official connection between the
two.
There had followed a period of pure
trades-unionism during which, under the
sanction of Rule 6, industrial bodies
could enter the league organisation as
solid blocks, and vote as blocks in the
selection of candidates. This change
brought into the movement the funds
and numbers of unionists, but ended the
selection of ability.
From then on the only possible can-
didate became the union officer, the
aspirant who could bring to bear the
union’s dominating
strength. The union sec-
retaries rapidly become
the ward bosses of the
movement; their hands
held the keys which
opened or closed every
gate to its distinctions.
Those who belonged to
the earlier period and
had already passed
through formed, as it
were, the party’s first
stratum. The second
stratum was deposited
as the result of an en-
tirely different process,
and of quite other
material.
A FINAL stage in
our development
opened with the adher-
ence of a portion of the
Catholic population of
the State which had
previously been hostile.
This was chiefly due
to the politic mind
of Cardinal Moran, a clear thinker on
public affairs. He was one of the first
to foresee in Australia the possibilities
of the rising Labor party and the promi-
nent part it might be called upon to play
if it would maintain a certain measure
of commonsense—the same measure as
that with which he had conducted
Catholic and Irish affairs within the
Commonwealth. He urged his people to
support it.
The democratic half of Catholicism
was already marshalled in our ranks, and
the accession of further large groups of
wealthy members of the church could,
he thought, have nothing but a benefici-
ally restraining influence. With their
force behind a movement headed by such
men as Watson in the Federal sphere and
McGowen in our own, its rational and
successful future should be assured.
THE CASE
OF PETER
BOWLING
Every incoming
Government finds
some difficult
business confront-
ing it. We had
two trying items
which we inherited directly from our pre-
decessors.
A leading issue of the election had
been the imprisonment of a prominent
trades-union leader, Peter
Bowling, and we had pledged
ourselves, if victorious,
to release him. It was now
arranged that I, who had
the double portfolio of
Attorney-General and Min-
ister for Justice, should get
into harness a day or so
earlier than the other Min-
isters in order that the neces-
sary steps for Bowling’s re-
lease might be taken forth-
with. This was done, and
the first act of my Minis-
terial life was the signing of
a minute requesting Mr.
Justice Pring (before whom
Bowling had been tried) to
furnish a report upon his
case. The report was by
no means unfavorable.
Bowling was a man of
great personal worth, and
his release, which was
effected immediately, was
generally applauded.

LABOR AND
THE DEATH
PENALTY
The other
matter which
also came under
my jurisdiction
caused us con-
siderably more
perplexity. An atrocious murder —by a
father of his daughter—had been com-
mitted. A verdict of guilty had been re-
turned, but a confirmation of the death
sentence by the Executive (essential in
our State) had been postponed by our
predecessors.
There was some excuse for this. Dur-
ing an election campaign it is always
difficult to get Ministers together, and
certainly in the confirming of a capital
sentence every Minister ought to be con-
sulted. In the heat which still remained
from the campaign, however, we made
no allowances, and roundly charged the
outgoing Ministry with having thrust
their responsibilities on to us because
they did not desire to send a
man to the gallows while
electioneering.
Whatever their reasons may
have been, their actions re-
sulted in this wretched man
lying under sentence of death
for many weeks before our
appointment, and the task of
determining his fate was our
earliest collective responsi-
bility. Cabinet sat for two
days, filled with the most dis-
tressing and agitated discus-
sion. None of us had had the
responsibility of life and death
before, and we finally re-
solved to com-
mute his sen-
tence to im-
prisonment for
life.

mine, and concentrated an unenviable
measure of attention upon my own per-
sonality. It was easy to suggest that in
me the country had an Attorney-General
who sympathised with murderers—parti-
cularly with murderers of their own
daughters —whose principal mission in
life was to see that they escaped the hang-
man, and whose main remaining purpose
was to annul verdicts of juries and sen-
tences of Courts by opening the gaol
doors for offenders like Bowling.
This led to a close and, as I still think,
mischievous scrutiny of my other acts
as Minister for Justice which long out-
lived its original cause. During my occu-
pancy of the position, it was always very
difficult for me to recommend favorable
treatment of a first offender —or even as
Attorney-General to file a nolle prosequi
without inviting attack both in Parlia-
ment and in the press.
“JOCK”
GARLAND
Our first short
session was punc-
tuated by several
stirring scenes,
almost all turning on matters of this kind.
I hit back as smartly as I was able.
I published a list showing the number
of sentences remitted or commuted dur-
ing my period in office, comparing them
with those of a similar period under my
predecessor Garland, and demonstrating
that he had been equally active in the
cause of mercy. He, however, I pointed
out, had had in us a decent Opposition
which had refused to make political
capital out of the decisions of Ministers
for Justice, while we were now apparently
at the mercy of a pack of howling wild
animals. I was also able to turn up the
records of a case where Wade had
directly intervened to release a certain
Syrian offender known as Ben Habdah.
These bright resorts to the weapon of
tu quoque obtained me peace for
moments, but only for moments. The
session ended after three or four weeks
with nobody’s reputation made and my
own a good deal injured.
A FEDERAL
IMBROGLIO
Hardly had our
tangled history
begun when the
effort of our Fed-
eral colleagues to enlarge the indus-
trial powers of the Commonwealth Par-
liament came to add fresh difficulties to
the State parties.
Labor men in the Federal Parliament
had been to some extent fish out of
water. The mission in life of Labor men
being to increase wages and regulate in-
dustrial conditions, they were much irked
at finding themselves in
a Parliament which had
appparently no direct
power over wages and
very little over industrial
conditions. That it was
a Parliament of limited
powers, and that legislat-
ing for “labor” was not
among them to any great
degree, were conceptions
which for a long time
found no acceptance
among Federal Laborites.
Federal Labor effort
had two phases. During
the first various attempts
had been made to legis-
late for “labor” without
the power. This had just
closed. During the
second efforts were to be
made to get the neces-
sary power. Thus the
tariff had been regarded
as affording an oppor-
tunity for regulating in-
dustrial conditions.
Manufacturers might be
protected if they paid
union rates, otherwise
not. This idea was destined to igno-
minious extinction at the hands of the
High Court. Similarly, it was remem-
bered that the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment had authority to legislate on the
question of trade-marks, and from this
there emanated the fantasy of the “union
label” legislation, to which also the High
Court gave the coup de grace.
In the Northern Territory and in the
Federal capital site, as well as generally
through the Commonwealth public ser-
vice, Labor ideals were given consider-
able effect, and those three domains of
Government activity, it may be noted in
passing, have always shown quite a dis-
tinguishing inefficiency, in spite of the
high calibre of individual officials. It
had by now dawned upon Labor men
in the Federal Parliament that they
could only acquire control in any gen-
eral way over Labor interests in the
Commonwealth by some change in the
Constitution, placing industrial legisla-
tion in their hands.
THE STATE
RIGHTER
This is no place
in which to enter
upon detailed dis-
cussion of this
scheme, but my own objections to
it were based upon, first, a deep-seated
disbelief in the adequacy of the Federal
Parliament’s knowledge of the domestic
affairs of the six Australian communi-
ties, and, second, a rooted distrust in the
efficacy of Federal administration. It
was difficult to see, in the mind’s eye, a
Parliament representing a country nearly
the size of Europe legislating with suc-
cess for the domestic interests and inter-
nal needs of each of its widely-scattered
parts ; and it was still more difficult to
see such legislation, even if it were
by some miracle achieved, firmly and
wisely applied in Northern Queens-
land or Westralia by an executive
seated in Melbourne. Our movement
was committed, however, to such re-
forms in the Constitution as were needed
to give the Federal Parlia-
ment powers to obtain
“effective arbitration,” “con-
trol of inter-State mono-
polies” and “new Protec-
tion” — i.e., a tariff where
advantages could be given
or withheld according as
Australian manufacturers
complied, or failed to com-
ply, with trades-union con-
ditions. These proposals
had been carried at the
Brisbane conference of
1908, and became, under
our Constitution, part of
the Federal platform of the
party. All hands prepared,
therefore, though many of
us with considerable mis-
giving, to support a consti-
tutional change to this ex-
tent as part' of our officially-
declared purpose. Fisher
and Watson, the leader and
ex-leader of the Federal
party, had been present at
Brisbane as delegates, and
had acquiesced in its

abandonment of larger measures of
change. Had its decisions been given
honest effect to in 1911 by the Fisher
Government the constitutional changes
sought would probably have been
carried.
ENTER
W. M. HUGHES
Unluckily, Wat-
son had by now
retired from Par-
liament. Fisher
showed himself, as he always re-
mained, conscientious but easily man-
ageable by abler men than himself. The
leading mind in the new Government
was that' of Mr. Hughes, and, although
the doctrine of a “scrap of paper” had
not yet been formulated by Bethmann-
Hollweg, the pentrating intelligence of
the Federal Attorney-General had
divined it and made it his own years
in advance. The Brisbane resolutions
were mere froth and bubble, with no
binding effect on him. He formulated
a scheme of constitutional amendment of
his own which was to give the Federal
Parliament, among other things, full con-
trol of all domestic industry and full
control of all domestic commerce. This
Mr. Fisher, with uncomprehending readi-
ness, accepted, and called on the whole
movement to rally to.
As soon as copies of the bill (which
had to be carried in the Federal Parlia-
ment as the first step in a constitutional
amendment) reached Sydney, it was de-
cided, in view of the serious departures
from the platform indicated, that Mc-
Gowen and Beeby should go to Mel-
bourne at the week-end and interview
the Federal Ministers. Telegrams were
sent informing the Federal Government
of their visit.
“STATE
INSECTS”
No notice was
taken of our mes-
sag e. Proceed-
ings in the Fed-
eral Parliament were, if anything,
hurried up, and the Premier and his col-
league reached Melbourne on Saturday
morning, to find that the third reading
of the Amending Bill had
been taken in the Senate
on the Friday evening, and
the measure was through!
This was our first experi-
ence of the amenities of
Minis terial intercourse
with Mr. Fisher at the
head of Commonwealth
affairs. It was not likely
to be forgotten.
At the annual Labor
conference which came on
in our State shortly after-
wards the whole matter
came up for further dis-
cussion. We had what
looked like an unanswer-
able case, but it failed
utterly on precedent. The
movement was in no mood
to hear cold reason or dis-
cuss matters of abstract
propriety. It had been
wrought up by the events
of the year into a condi-
tion of hopeful excitement
which, at the time, threat-
ened to become chronic.
The surprising successes of 1910 —
the victories in both Federal and
State arenas —had filled our supporters
with the craziest of expectations. They
counted on perpetual further victory,
gained without further trouble. Why
worry about reforms for New South
Wales when, by the simple process of
amending the Constitution, reformation
in a flood could be poured over the
whole area of the Commonwealth? The
hour of Labor’s triumph had arrived. It
was essential to exploit it to the utter-
most.
In the past it had often required the
united efforts of all its leaders to rescue
the movement from the effects of such
rushes of blood to the head. But this
time the leaders were divided. The Fed-
eral group was urging on and stimu-
lating this feeling. Our efforts to stem
it were almost laughably futile. Our
opposition was looked upon, at the best,
as interested, while Mr. Lamond (the
editor of the “Worker,” the official organ
of the Shearers’ Union, afterwards Min-
ister for Repatriation, but not then a
member) freely asserted our inspiration
by personal jealousy of the Federal Min-
isters. We were the Lilliputians of de-
mocracy, striving to tie down the new
giant with pack-threads ; and the friendly
appellation of “The State Insects,” the
offspring of Mr. Lamond’s fertile brain,
clung to us for some years after.
[Another chapter from Holman’s Life will
be given in next week’s Bulletin.]

The theory of treating symptoms rather than the cause
is still not generally understood. There are those who, if
they have a pain in the kidneys, rub in oils or emulsion.
Liverish people take a headache cure and nervous folks still
take stimulants, or even drugs, to
“steady their nerves,” and so on.
They fail to see that they merely
ease the trouble, only for it to
return in a more severe form. In
other words, they have not extin-
guished the fire, but simply turned
off the fire alarm. Treating the
cause may take a little longer and
call for more patience, but it has
the advantage of being much more
beneficial.
In Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills will be found the
remedy that gets at the cause. They give you clean bowels,
a healthy stomach, and stimulate the Liver and Kidneys. For
Biliousness, Dizziness, Constipation, and such complaints, arising
from imperfect Digestion, Sluggish Liver, and inactive Kidneys,
they are unexcelled.

WORMS
THEIR SYMPTOMS AND
TREATMENT .
Worms, by their movements and the
interruption they offer to the contents
of the Bowels, generally occasion pain
or uneasiness in the Abdomen, some-
times spasmodic, sometimes gnawing and
biting, and not infrequently of a vague,
indescribable character, and yet very dis-
tressing. Sympathetic with this is a sen-
sation of itching at the nostrils, producing
a disposition to pick the Nose, which is
characteristic of the affection. The
Bowels are often disordered, sometimes
relaxed, as in Dysentery. The appetite
is exceedingly variable; in some cases
natural, in others deficient, craving or
depraved, one condition not infrequently
alternating with another. The Abdomen
is often hard, swollen and tympanetic,
the breath heavy and foetid, and tongue
furred, with disagreeable taste, and a
copious flow of saliva; swelling of the
upper lip, bleeding of the nostrils and
disposition to grind the teeth during the
sleep are other characteristic symptoms.
The effects, however, often extend be-
yond the Alimentary Canal, and various
derangements of health are experienced
in consequence, either of. the direct irri-
tation of the worms or of the disordered
digestion which they occasion. Amongst
the most common of these are nervous
affections, such as fretfulness, irritation
of temper, wakefulness or disposition to
excessive sleep, disturbed sleep, sudden
starting out of sleep as if from fright,
dizziness, spasmodic movements of the
eyelids.
Unfortunately, many mothers fail to
recognise the fact that their little ones
are suffering intense pain and distress,
and are practically irresponsible for the
outbursts of temper, restlessness and
peevishness, and until some more serious
symptoms appear nothing is done to
alleviate the distress. The symptoms of
this disease are somewhat variable, but
generally they are so characteristic that
no mother need have any doubts. The
best proof of worms is worms, and if
the general conduct of the child is such
as to give the slightest suspicion a care-
ful watch will afford ample proof.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are a purely vegetable medicinal pre-
paration, compounded on a scientific
principle for the eradication of worms
which infest the Intestines. They, contain
specific properties which destroy the
worms but cause no injury to the
Stomach or Bowels, and do not weaken
the system. The pellets are prepared in
the form of a confection or lolly, have
no disagreeable taste or smell, but, on the
contrary, inspire children to take them
as they would an ordinary sweet.
