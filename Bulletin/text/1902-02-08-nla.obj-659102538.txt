THE RED PAGE.
LOVE-LETTERS ! They have streamed
in, poured in; the office is flooded
with them. Is the whole, world
writing love-letters ? To be sure,
most of them are not worth printing : they
range the gamut of hysteria, from mild to
maudlin ; they sweep the lyre of bathos,
from stilted to stupid ; they would hardly
deceive that remarkable bird with its head
in a bush—the woman in love. For the rest:
well, here are some ; and we will positively
have to print a page of others—say a month
hence. In the meantime kindly note that
the office soul abhorreth love-letters.
It was in mind to discuss the pathology of
love-letters, to weave examples into a gar-
land with a not inexpert skein of comment
—or would you sooner see the naked love-
soul unadorned ? To comment or not to
comment : that was the question, and
now it is out of the question. The
mass of correspondence forbids comment.
Only an introductory word, a word here
and there to relieve the monotony ;
for love-letters breed monotony : believe the
expert! “Now, up curtain! and let us
see what our painters have done for us.’ r
Enter the Garden of the Secret Rose—
“far-off, most secret, and inviolate Rose”
by the way of “ Ariston ”
Mine,—See how I begin ? You ark mine, and
I will say it, and when you come again I will
scream it at you. You won’t
say with your lips that you
love me, but there is some-
thing about you that is a tell-
tale. And you could not stop
them from telling, because it
is your eyes. You laugh at
me when I bathe them with
kisses, and say I am cheating
your lips ; but I shall always
do so until your stubborn red
lips say _“ I love you.” I
wonder, if I could make you
say it, if I should be any
happier? I love opposition,
and things to fight, and
although i adore you, and
"Those mutinous
lip!"
love you to my utter distraction, I shall fight you
all the time. How long ago yesterday seems !
and to have to wait two more days before I can
be “ hugged by a bear ” seems an eternity. I love
you to hurt me and bruise me when you crush me
up in your arms; and when you kiss me —then
you draw all my life and soul through my lips,
and at such times I cease to be myself and become
‘‘you.” I have been watching the sunshine play-
ing on the trees in the garden. The sunshine is
like love, mein lieb, gets info all the little out-of-
the-way corners, and makes love and smiles most
“promiscuous.” Why isn’t life all love, and sun-
shine, and couches of rose-leaves, and why do you
ever have to go away from me when I love you
so ! T wonder if you will think what this night is ?
It is just three years since you kissed me first.
Do you, remember, love, the party, and the rooms
were very hot. We went (you and me) on-to the
balcony, and the moonlight gleamed on my bare
shoulders, and you suddenly stooped and kissed
me. You never knew that I had been waiting
for that kiss for many months. How lovely
the world looked that night, and how much
lovelier it has grown every month since. It is
very beautiful to be alive. I love you, I love you,
I love you. I wish I could sleep for two days and
nights and wake up like the “ enchanted Princess ”
and find you by my side.
With a heart full of caresses and kisses, your
girl.
ARISTON.
Whither now ? By the way of An English-
woman's Love-Letters ?—
Dearest, dearest, dearest, —Will night never
come and bring you with it ? Was it only yester-
day you told me that you loved me ?—I who have
loved you so long, and have held myself in bond-
age to my love for you ? A slave just freed could
not be more joyous than I, now that I may unre-
servedly give myself to you —you, whom I shall
see to-night! Oh, come quickly, my beloved ; let
me feel your strong embrace ; feel your heart beat
against my breast; feel the hot blood throbbing
as I lay my lips on your neck ; feel the wild long-
ing of glad desire coursing through every vein in
our bodies; feel your warm kisses on my hair,
and cheeks, and forehead; and then, when the
first mad joy of meeting is over, feel your arm
around me as we walk up and down the lane talk-
ing, talking, talking of all that makes life good
to us, for our passionate love is not going to blot
all the calm friendship that has been ours so long,
is it, my Man of Men ?
This morning, in my haste to get quickly
through the usual round, and so bring the time of
your coming nearer, I went early to feed the
horses and put them out, and there, beneath me
and above me, was the whole round world
wrapped in soft, white mist. Away over the
valley that ends in Melbourne I could see it, and
it lay close in every deep gully past Lilydale and
Dandenong. I stood, almost afraid to breathe—
afraid to break the spell laid on me by the great
purity around ; when suddenly a brightness broke
over the ranges, and the glad sun burst through
the clouds, and I thought he cried laughingly :
“Ah, ha! Ah, ha! I’ve found you out! I’ve
found you out! ”
All the mists quickly fled away, up and up the
long gullies, and over the brow of the hills, and I
fancied I saw waving, white, amorous arms, and
heard faint farewells wailing to the earth, who
flushed rosy red beneath the sun’s bold' stare, and
I thought I heard her laugh softly and say, “ I care
not ! care not! care not! I love the dear mist, love
to draw him close to my bosom, and hold him there
through the long, still nights; he gives me
strength which helps me return you glance for
glance through the hot noonday. So laugh as you
will, I care not! ”
So with me, beloved, I care not who knows how
I love you. I would publish it to the wide world,
from the highest peak of my dear hills I would
call all nature
to witness
how I love
you, love you,
love you, and
how I fondly
dream of the
glad nights
that shall be
ours, when I
will take your
dear dark
head on my
bosom, and so
holding you
close shall
rest “tillday-
break andthe
shadows flee
away.”
How shall
I wait till
evening and
the glad hour
when I shall
meet you by the slip-rails ? I shall be there
listening as you come galloping, galloping, along
the bush track to the foot of the long hill, dear
true love: a wild fever of longing possesses me,
and it is not yet mid-day.
All my heart goes with this letter to you and
whispers come! come!—oh, come quickly, dearest
and best of men, to your most faithfully fond
GIPPSLAND GIRL.
—into a Bad Man’s relic-box—
jDecember 18th, 1889.
My Dearest,—You are gone eight minutes
almost, and I can’t let you go ; I must write to
you. It seems almost a cruelty that you, who
are so much me—so much and so wonderfully
mine—can, by the closing of the front door, be-
come just a memory. Yet I have only to close
my eyes and I can, in a wizardish sort of way,
conjure you to myself again. Ido so often.
There is the dear little dump (it isn’t a cleft, or a
dimple even, so dump ”
must do to describe it) in
your chin ; the line that is
just coming, the delayed
reward of a great good
humour, and is eating its
way from the corner of
your mouth into your
cheek ; the rum«*le in your
left eyebrow that some day
I shall brush and kiss into
smoothness, anu the smile
that shows in your eyes
first, alters the colour of the
pupils for a brief second,
and goes. Your face is a
country I know very well
A...Bump.
B. Rumpled Eyeoebrow.
indeed, and love to linger in, Dearest.
For a moment I felt chilled and longed for your
actual presence ; I thought, “Is widowhood like
that ? ” with a great dread. How dreadful to see
you, to know, to remember everything, and you,
you away. I am often frightened when I am
alone and quiet as I am now ; perhaps great
happiness is not just, we cannot ever deserve it—
only, only I want it so much ! I suppose this
fright is a bogey-fright; indeed, I have the feeling
this minute that I used to have as a little girl, that
I can only describe as the go-to-bed-for-being-
naughty feeling. I reflect that if my happiness
could fill this and several other worlds, it all could
mean no more than being loved by you and loving
you.
* * * *
I want love to weave itself into everything
we do, think, want and have. lam valiant
because I know. I could be absolutely content
tramping the country in a gipsy house-cart with
love and you. You will have surprises. I have
been running the gamut of things, from the making
of dresses to t e cooking of pies, these months
back. Home shall be home to you, dearest, if I
shed my heart over it’s walls to make it glow.
This is another domestic, Martha-like letter,
and not in the least what I intended it to be. The
letter that shall say all I want, I am afraid, will
never be written. If you were here now, and I
could lay my cheek against yours and touch your
other cheek with my hand, you might guess at
that I never c-an get to fire words. And so, my
dearest, my own dearest, good night!
—and so to a letter which it is “almost a
sacrilege to publish a quaint example of
the male in figurative hysterics—
London , January 15th.
Come back—come back, Margaret, my beloved,
for this suffering is more than I can bear. Is it
not enough to have seen you vanish from my
sight, but that everything reminds me of you ?
I opened this book to-night to write to you ; it
opened at the flowers you gave me at parting.
The sight of them brought your dear image
vividly before me. My Cod ! shall I ever see the
reality again ? Beloved, I recognise now how
cruel I have been to you. I have doubted you,
but you went away with my whole love and trust
—ay, and the full magnitude of that love I had
not guessed till I saw your dear face disappear.
Oh, why is fate so cruel to me? To-night, there
seems no more to live for. I cannot think, I can-
not write as I would wish, but I know you will
not be hypercritical. Oh ! the torture I under-
went this afternoon when the ship was moving
slowly, but, alas, all too swiftly away. A dozen
times I thought I would break down as the music
of the ship’s band brought the strains of “ All
Souls’ Day ” across the space of water, narrow at
“ I thought I would break down!"
first, but ever widening us. lam at home now,
and have wept for the last hour, and am still
weeping, and bitterly, as I never have before.
Unmanly, people might say, but I care not.
Oh, my love, my love, why art thou torn from
me? Love me, love me , love me with all your
heart. My life is yours ; all, all that lam and
have is yours, body and soul. Pray for me,
sweet, that I may forget you, or die.
And, to-night, strangers will gaze on your dear,
sweet face. Will touch your hands, and I may not.
My dearest, 1 1 want you ALL, all your thoughts,
all your caresses: I would begrudge anybody a
single crumb from the rich table at which I have
feasted, I love you so, my dear. Good-night,
sweetheart. Angels guard your path. Good-
night, dear love! Love me. Ah ! love me.
» January 16tli.
Good-morning, dear one. I pray you bad a
less miserable night than I.
In my selfishness last night I never thought
how ill you were when you left, but afterwards the
thought came to me. My love, would I could
suffer all your pains for you. You should not
suffer ; your path through life should be strewn
with roses and fragrant with frank icense and
myrrh. Dear love, shall I ever knoj happiness
again? Now Ido not think so. Dear, I cannot
part witli you, you "have entered into ray life, and
this separation is more than I can bear. My love.
Oh, my dear love. ft
January 17tK.
Another night has gone, and again I awake with
a sense of desolation. Dear, shall I ever see you
again ? I must, or die, fdr the salt of life has lost
its savour. lam working hard, as the best means
of deadening my heart-pain. I have wild ideas of
making a fortune at my practice in the coming
year, and of going out to Australia to you. Will
you love me in a year, dear one ? or shall I be but
a memory ?
Dear, I pray that you are well and happy. My
happiness has gone, and the romance of my life,
the bright, sparkling tide gleaming with gliding
white sails has ebbed, and only the bare mud-
flats of mere existence left.
I pity my brother. I feel drawn closer to him
by the tie of our love for you, but he, poor fellow,
has not the comfort of knowing that his love is
returned as I know mine is.
The first intensity of my agony has passed and
I can write more calmly.
How good you have been to me, and how inade-
quately have I requited your goodness, how un-
worthy am I of your love, immeasurably superior
to me as you are in everything, in intellect,
generosity, and greatness of heart—and yet you
loved me, and still love me I hope and pray, for
without your love how can I live ? Dear, I love
you as I never have loved ; no other woman will
ever attract-me, my life is dedicated to you, my
queen, whether ever I see you again or not.
Good-bye, dear one—dear little love ! —Write to
me from every port. Your letters are all I have to
live for now. I love you so that this letter seems
cold and vapid. Only Christ in His High Heaven
knows how I love you. Dove me back ! Love me !
love me ! ! e .l.
How the Space has fled along with un-
happy Time! Then, think of the others 1
How can all these glories, triumphs,
spoils of Love shrink to the little measure of

Thursday Night.
My Darling.—l feel broken Hearted. I did not
get the Divorce. ...
I have not slept this three or four nights think
—think, all the time feel silly for the want of
sleep and the nights seem so long. I would like
to land in some night and see you in that
large and empty room. I would give you a cuddle
and kisses by gelore. . . ,
“ In that large and empty [?]o[?]m”
I was delighted to receive your letter: when I
cannot sleep I take out your letters and read them
over and over but you write me such short ones
and don’t tell me any newes. I think you must
have fallen in love with Someone. ...
Now my Dearest what are we to do now we
cannot get married. I wish now we never had
met. I feel as if I cannot live without you. I
look on you as a Husband now and to think we
cannot get married it nearly breaks my heart.
I never think of anyone else but you. I dont
seem to want to speak to men sience I left. I have
snubbed such a lot wanting to get a yarn on with
me at the hotels 1 have been. I cried nearly all
last night, and kept in my room all day. ...
Good-bye my love and Dearest. Above all
yours for ever.
ii.
My Dearest Love,
I just got your letter. I am dissopinted at
you not writing me longer letters: you seem as
usual —you don’t talk much and it is the sam§
with yog writing. Now my Dear, If your next
letters are not a little longer I won’t write to you
at all. ... I write long letters to you with all my
sickness and troubles. I feel as if I never want to
go back sience I lost the Divorce.
you are the worest correspondent ever I had
away from home, you know I don’t like writing
But I write to you regeraley and long letters-1
have sent you a parcel by this mail.
Friday morning-
My Darling,—I have been thinking all night.
I have made up my mind to appeal. I am going
straight to the lawyer now. Let me know what
you think of it. When you write, send next letter
toG.P.O.
Now I must make the Best of a bad job.
Your Broken-hearted lover,
P.S.—I hope to get Divorce yet.
Hi..
Monday.
My Dearest,
I received your short letter again, it was
very welcome. But would be more so If it was
longer. You need not make any excuses, as you
could have written the letter before the mail came
in 1 am cross with you. But your troubles, I will
pay you out when I go back. . . . I never intended
to write to any one else but you while away from
home. I dont get any newes from you so I am
writing too others today. Your time cannot be
so presious ... I wont tell you any more newes
untill I get longer letters from you.
My letters will be very short for futhure.
Yours truly
P.S. I am writing in a hurry I am rather
pushed for time last night and this morning ?
Good bye Dearest.
Hitherto, then, hath the Lord Love helped
us. In a month He may help us farther.
G.
Love-Letters .
t.
Dearest, —Forgive me—don’t let any question
of right or wrong come into your mind. What do
I care ? I want to feel your arms about me—to
have you kiss me back to happiness. In love like
mine there is no quibble of right or wrong. I love
you, and I cannot live without you—only forgive
me, forgive me. If you were near enough I should
win your pardon by the mere incessant pleading
of those words, I think. Indeed, the whole night
and day since we parted have been nothing but
that cry. Is it only a day and a night? It seems
so long that if.you do not come quickly I am
afraid it will be a haggard old woman who will
meet you. When you gave me love, you gave me
life —for I never lived till then. But you in-
creased my capacity for suffering,—oh, ever so
much !
I asked myself—all last night and to-day I
asked myself—what shall I do if he does not for-
give? I cannot bear to think of it —without you
I am like a lonely child, frightened of the dark.
No, you cannot be so cruel as to give me so much
and take it all away again. I cannot —I will not
think it is true. Dearest, I am here—I am wait-
ing for you—I am longing for you to forgive me—
I am aching to be kissed.
II.
I have just been down to the river, dearest —
down by the coolibah where we sat the night you
told me that you loved me —when my eyes and
my voice and every bit of me had been telling you
—for ever so long—that I loved you. I ought to
be ashamed to say that, but I am not. It is a
year ago to-night—a whole year, and you are
so far away. Wicked man, why are you so far
away? You should be here to go over all the
sweet, old, foolish time again—a love scene of one
is such a pitiable affair.
I wonder if you thought of it to-day—out
drafting sheep in the dusty yards, I suppose, or
riding round the everlasting fences. I thought
of it all day long, with delicious little thrills that
came over me at unexpected intervals —and to-
night, just when the moon was peeping over the
edge of the plain I slipped away to the dear old
spot. I leaned my head against the tree —oh, but
it is a poor, miserable substitute for a shoulder,
dear boy—and when I thought of lonely you away
on the dusty plains, and lonely me here, I won’t
say I did n’t weep a little weep.
Won’t you come back, dear? If your heart-
strings tugged as mine do, nothing could keep you
away. We have been so patient, you and I—-and
the time is so weary without you. It seems as if
ever and ever would not make up for the wasted
time. And I grudge every moment —I am jealous
of every interest which may keep you from me.
You have all the world—with me as an incidental.
I have only you. People have said that in all
sorts of other and better ways. People have been
loving and telling their love since the world began.
I only know of one way—but I think perhaps it is
convincing. ' Come to me Beloved, and I will tell
you—out there under the coolibah, before the moon
is over the edge of the plain.
III.
This is written to say Good-bye. And yet even
when the word is written I cannot realise that it
is true. You cannot —oh, my one Love, you can-
not 'mean to really send me from you —away into
the cold and the darkness that are everywhere
where you are not.
I know another woman has come between us. I
know it is an outrage on my pride to stoop to sue
for vour love. Pride ! What pride have I ? Can
it stand against the sickening desolation when you
are gone? Can it quell the memory of your
kisses, of the touch of your hands, the sound of
your voice? Can it blot out those hours when I
lay in your arms and you loved me? Oh, God !
give me forgetfulness, else I shall die of the mere
craving for you again. See, Dear, I have no pride
—it is all gone in love. Only Come back to me.
You used to say that I was loving and beautiful.
I am just as fair—save that my eyes are haggard
with tears, and your kisses can cure that. Loving !
Oh, dearest, no woman on earth can be more loving
than I. But I shall not tire you with my kisses.
I shall be so careful—so careful that your love
does not again grow cold through sheer satiety.
What can I do that I have not done? I will do
anything— anything, if you will let me stay with
you. I wanted my heart to be a pillow for your
head—now I would have it a stool for your foot
rather than nothing at all to you. I can write no
more—I can only say, as I shall say until I die —
“ I love you ! I love you ! I love you ! ”

It is a pretty allegory. We, however, enter the Twentieth Century with minds free from old superstitions.
MAGIC is Dead ! SCIENCE Reigns Supreme l
Science, with cleanly-chiselled features, penetrating vision, emotionless, scrutinises each of life’s problems, and proudly
and firmly demands to know the cause of every effect.
In ancient days the Wonderful Curative Properties of
WARNER’S SAFE CURE
would have been looked upon as magical. Unerring science now insists upon the effect being traced to its primary
cause, and asks, “ Why does Warner’s Safe Cure cure so many diseases of seemingly diverse origin ? ” It is
demonstrated that Warner’s Safe Cure does ACTUALLY CURE such diseases as . . .
Rheumatism
Gout
Neuralgia
Lumbago
Backache
Sciatica
Blood Disorders
Anaemia
Indigestion
Biliousness
Sick Headache
General Debility
Gravel
Bladder Troubles
Bright’s Disease
But WHY does this medicine act in this manner ? SCIENCE HERSELE SUPPLIES THE ANSWER, as, after searching
examination, she only can :
“ WARNER’S SAFE CURE Cures all these Diseases
BECAUSE they one and all arise from an impaired action of the KIDNEYS and LIVER. The cause of each is the same.
Urinary and Biliary Poisons, which healthy Kidneys and Liver normally extract from the blood and expel from the body, are
suffered to remain in the system.”
WARNCR’S SAF€ CUR€, by restoring the Kidney’s and Liver to health, renews the power of those vital organs and
enables them to properly perform their natural functions. All Urinary and Biliary Poisons are then duly removed from the
blood, and diseases caused by the presence of such poisons, as a matter of course, cease to exist.

Yer no good fer any hardship if yer’ve always

Cut an’ take the homeward track,

Steady ! you galloping riders !
Steady ! and swing to the side 1
Room for the little bush spiders—
Room ! for the world is wide !
See, where the sunbeams are gilding,
Centre and circle and thread,
How they are building and building
Slowly and surely ahead.
Swing to the left there, and leave them
The pride of the sweat of their brow,
The brave little masons that weave then'.
Grey bridges from blossom to bough !
Listen ! ye poor little spiders !
Spinning so fast in the dawn,
Cursing us blundering riders
Who gallop with bridles undrawn,
Racing away through the ridges
Red-hot on the warrisral trail,
Bursting your gossamer bridges,
Girder and planking and rail!
Listen ! my brave little toilers,
You will be laboring on
When the last of your pitiless spoilers
Is over Life’s ranges and gone :
When we’re done with the sham and the sinning
In the hour that must come to us soon,
With Death’s withered garland for winning,
You will be spinning and spinning
Our silvery shrouds by the moon !

Over the Saltbush Plain.
A scorching day and the sun on high
Over the Saltbush Plain,
The grass all dead and the tanks all dry ;
Never a sign of rain.
The burnished crow in the brazen skies
Is watching the cattle with greedy eyes,
Claiming the corpse of each that dies:
This is the crow’s domain.
A team crawls on with a station load
Piled on a creaking wain,
Raising the dust from the burning road,
Grey dust of the Saltbush Plain ;
Weary horses are tramping slow,
With dragging steps o’er the sand they go,
Steaming bodies and heads held low,
These slaves on their clanking chain.
Surely they, in their bursting hearts,
Must curse the Saltbush Plain !
Longing ever for brighter parts,
Dreaming a sad refrain
Of breezes cool and of paddocks green
(Even the horse has his Might-Have-Been,
And his dreams of rivers of silver sheen,
As he answers the whip and rein).
Whalers”—God help them ! —for ever tramp
Singly or by twain,
Wandering on from camp to camp,
Forward and back again.
Plodding onwards in dusty rags—
Never a dream but to fill their bags,
Never a home but beside their swags—
They haunt the Saltbush Plain.
Cool winds blowing and tall, green grass
Waving like richest grain ;
Cheerful songs as the fat stock pass,
Breath of the mist and rain !
Is this the place where the black crows band?
Yes ! but the Springtime’s o’er the land,
The drought is broken, the feed is grand,

SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1902.
Unprofitable Industries.
The London Times has been publishing, and
Sydney Telegraph has been republishing,
certain articles on “the Crisis in British
Industry.” It is a doleful tale, and the
burden of it is that, within the last year or
two, many British industries have commenced
to die out with alarming suddenness through
the action of trades-unions in forcing up
wages. Possibly the Times, as a paper that
has a profound objection to trades-unions
and to the policy of forcing up wages,
exaggerates to some extent; more probably
it doesn’t. Certainly, if wages are forced up
to any great extent in a Freetrade country
the industries concerned must needs burst
unless there are countervailing circum-
stances. No country can afford to pay
higher wages than its adjacent foreign
rivals in any industry which is exposed to
foreign competition unless—
(l) Its machinery is so much better, or its workmen so
much better or so much more industrious, that it can
turn out (say) 50 per cent, more work per man to coun-
terbalance the payment of (say) 50 per cent, more wages.
Or (2) it has an immensely superior supply of raw
material.
Or (3) it shuts out the goods of its cheap-labor rival by
Protective duties.
Protection against foreign goods doesn’t
make the products of local industry dearer,
but high wages assuredly do make them
dearer. If the Englishman is paid 6d. more
for making a pot than the German, then,
under Freetrade conditions, and even after
making due allowance for freights, nothing
can prevent the German being able to supply
the Duke of Westminster, or some other
English millionaire who could well afford to.
pay a reasonable price for his pot but
doesn't want to do so, with that kind of pot
at 3d, or 4d. below the English quotation.
And that, the Times alleges, is just what is
going wrong with the English pot-makers.
England is a long way off, but the same
problem is before Australia. Except in a
few occupations the trades-union rate of
wages and Freetrade are things which do not
go together. The occupations in which the
two are compatible are mostly of the para-
sitic variety, and are of a kind in which the
fiscal question doesn’t enter. Building houses,
felling trees, repairing boots and shoes and
ships, making boots, clothes and dresses to
measure, shoeing horses, making bread,
putting up monuments to returned con-
tingenters, laying down railways, erecting
bridges, cutting hair, dredging rivers,
making roads, driving vehicles, fencing,
ditching, milking and some other trades
are not menaced by foreign competition,
and the trades-unions can put up wages
in these industries under the most
rabid of Foreign-trade systems without
serious injury to the industries. But in the
main, they are industries which Can’t stand
by themselves, and merely consist of the
community eating its own tail. Beyond
them there are a multitude of industries
which consist in making things which can be
imported, and in these, under the Freetrade
policy, the worker must either accept about
the same money for the same quantity of
work as his foreign competitor, or see his
business depart altogether. That is what
The Times alleges is happening in England.
It is the awful result of trades-unionism in
putting up wages—or of Freetrade; it doesn’t
matter which way the matter is expressed.
• * *■ *
New South Wales has been trying partial
Freetrade for a number of years, and its in-
dustrial population may be divided under
four headings :
(1.) The comparatively well-paid class employed in the
industries which are not exposed to foreign competition,
such as boiling-down, wool-washing, shearing, ice-
making, bread-baking, making boots, clothes, dresses,
millinery, etc., to order, photography, building in all its
branches, brickmaking (the extreme weight of the article
in proportion to its value makes importation almost im-
possible), paving, asphalting, road-making, printing
newspapers, repairing ships and machinery, shoeing
horses, supplying gas and electricity, driving trains and
tram-cars, etc.
(2) The comparatively well-paid and very large class
which is employed by the State in making railways,
roads, bridges, culverts, wharves, building schools,
court-houses, gaols, etc., dredging rivers and so on—the
class which gets its good pay out of loan funds, and
enjoys O’Sullivan’s minimum wage.
(3) The comparatively well-paid class which is em-
ployed in a large number of industries which N.S.W. has
protected heavily in spite of its freetrade policy.
(4) The very small manufacturing class and the very
large non-manufacturing class, which is not protected,
and which is exposed to foreign competition, and which
is miserably, disgracefully over-worked and underpaid—
the makers of white work and slop-clothing of whom it
was recently reported that their earnings for a day’s hard
toil of 12 or 14 hours ran to about 2s. or so ; the agricul-
tural laborers who toil from “jackass to jackass” for 155.,
or less, per week ; the cocky agriculturist who makes a
wage that is barely sufficient to disguise his nakedness—
unless he gets a chance to go shearing or to engage in
some of the other pursuits that are not exposed to
foreign competition ; and other equally unlucky and ill-
remunerated toilers.
* • * *
The Foreign-trader’s legend is that in-
dustries are of two kinds—profitable and
unprofitable ; that the profitable industries
start naturally without Protection, and
that Protection is only required as a means
for starting the unprofitable industries. And
he is quite correct—though his correctness
makes his argument not a whit the less
foolish. Profit in this case only means profit
to the employer, and takes no account of
the worker. Any industry which can be
run with profit to the employer without Pro-
tection will be started without Protection.
And almost any industry can be started with
profit to the employer, and without Protection,
if the wages paid are only low enough. The
great agricultural industry is kept going,
partly because the State railways carry its
products at about half what the carriage
costs, and at less than one-fourth the rates
charged on some other classes of goods ;
partly because the wages are pitiably low. To
pay good wages Australia would need to put
up the price of bread a little and make its
landlords and importers and others pay a
little more for their daily loaf. Also it
would be necessary for it only to grow
enough wheat for its own requirements.
When, for want of more profitable occupa-
tions, a needless multitude of people are
forced on to a miserably barren soil, to grow
wheat for export to a glutted foreign market,
in competition with other exporting countries
that have less freight to pay and which pro-
duce twice as much per acre, its agricultural
population must be miserably poor. The
industry of the Sydney sewing women got on
well enough without Protection by paying
about 2s. or less for 14 hours hard work.
Every other industry can be established pro-
fitably without Protection, provided the wages
are sufficiently miserable. But if any Free-
trader can name any industry of importance
of the kind which is exposed to foreign com-
petition, that has arisen under Freetrade
conditions and that pays decent wages, then
the name of it would be thankfully received.
When an industry has grown to the enor-
mous dimensions of some of the great
American factories, with the best machinery
in the world, the best skill and experience,
and a huge staff of the best-trained workmen,
it may, by sheer economy, be able to pay
high wages and yet produce an article that
can compete with the world for cheapness,
but no industry ever commenced under such
conditions.
• » * *
No nation can live wholly by the in-
dustries which are not exposed to foreign
competition—by its people taking each
other’s photograph, or cutting each
other’s hair, or repairing each other’s
boots, or driving each other about in
trains or tram-cars, or shoeing each other’s
horses, or doing each other’s washing, or build-
ing bridges for each other to walk over. Nor
can it live for ever by building public works
out of loans. If it imports it must export to
pay for these imports, and it must produce
its exports cheaply enough to sell against all
the cheap-labor competitors of the world.
And Australia, being a deeply-indebted
country, requires also to export a vast
amount extra to pay the interest on
its foreign debts. It solves the problem
by grinding down a huge proportion of
its people in the most abject slavery.
If the small farmer and his casual employee,
and his three or four sons (who toil, in many
cases, -without any wages at all) were paid
even half the rate which the trades-unions fix
for the city bricklayer, the agricultural indus-
try, under Freetrade conditions, would
practically close up. So, possibly, would
half or three-fourths of the pastoral industry
under similar circumstances. Coghlan esti-
mates in his latest “Wealth and Progress
of N.S.W.” (page 496) that the whole
agricultural produce of the State only
runs to £7l per annum for each person
actually engaged—about 275. per week ;
and when from that is deducted cost
of tools, manure, rent of farm or inter-
est on purchase money (for the agriculturist
requires something more than a workshop—
he wants, probably, 150 acres of land, and in
some localities he needs 1000 acres, to make
a living), fencing, freight on his pro-
ducts to market (sometimes the freight eats
up more than half the total), horses, &c.,
he probably doesn’t average 15s. a week—
employer and employee taken together.
This is to maintain himself and wife and those
children who are too young to follow in the
footsteps of Old Dad and toil on the selec-
tion.
♦ * * *
So the prospects for the future are about
as follows :
(1) Australia must begin to produce its own manufac-
tured goods—the goods it now imports ; and it can only
begin its new industries in one of two ways. It must
either cut the wages of its workmen down to about 15s.
or 20s. a week in order that they may be able to compete
on Freetrade conditions with the larger and older-estab-
lished industries and more experienced workmen of other
lands, or it must have heavy Protection so that it can
pay decent wages, and be content to pay more for the
manufactured article to make up for these wages. If the
worker gets £1 a week more, and his product costs £1
more it may cost him ss. or 10s. a week more to live, and
the other 10s. or 15s. falls on the large unproductive
class.
Or (2) it must go on importing a huge proportion of its
manufactured goods, and paying for them in raw pro-
duce, and in order to turn out the produce at a cheap
enough rate to make it saleable in foreign markets Aus-
tralia must be content to see a huge proportion of its
country population toiling for 15s. a week or less. And
that is just as bad as to see the city artisan working at
the same dreadful figure.
* * * »
Australia must needs start what the Free-
trader calls unprofitable industries. There
are no other kind that it can start. The
Freetrader calls every industry unprofitable
which can’t turn out its product as cheaply
as that of any foreign competitor. And if
that rule is applied, and anything like a
reasonable trades-union rate of wages is paid,
then most of our existing manufacturing in-
dustries, almost all our agriculture, and
about half our pastoral industry is un-
profitable and should leave off. The
community can’t all live on public works
paid for out of loans, or on shoeing
each other’s horses, or cutting each other’s
hair. It must either have Protection and
decent wages, and pay higher prices to
counterbalance these wages ; or it must have
Freetrade and low wages and low prices ; or
it must have no industries at all. The
difficulty can’t be solved to any great extent
by the off-hand process of making the em-
ployer do with smaller profits. There was a
time when his profits were large, but they
are not now. It is estimated that in 1900
there was £529,000,000 invested in all kinds
of undertakings in Australasia—much of it
foreign capital—and the dividends paid were
a little over £21,000,000 —less than 4 per
cent. This was the amount which could be
traced in companies’ balance-sheets—pro-
bably private undertakings panned out on
about the same scale. The banks, once a
synonym for bloated affluence, didn’t
average per cent., and the importer and
a certain class of landlord were the only
persons who had any great profits. Nor can
the difficulty be got over by saying airily that
“this is a new country;” there are only
twelve pence in a shilling in a new country,
just as in an old one. And it can’t be
surmounted by large, loose talk about “our
magnificent natural resources.” Australia
can’t afford, under Freetrade conditions, to
pay any higher wages to the people who dig
out its magnificent natural resources than
are paid to the workers who dig out the
magnificent natural resources of other
countries. The Australian artisan is neither
more skilful nor more industrious than other
artisans, and there is no reason why he
should be able, under Freetrade conditions,
to earn more than other artisans.
* • * *
If the Australian market is secured to the
Australian artisan by a Protectionist policy,
and he is paid the sort of wages that the
Labor party hopes for, and which it should
hope for, he can’t produce as cheaply as the
sweated workman of some other countries.
The man who receives Bs. for eight hours’
work can’t produce as cheaply as the one
who works 10 hours for 3s. If New South
Wales had put a prohibitive duty on jewel-
lery, pianos, and top-hats and had made
them locally by labor paid at £3 or £4 a
week, then William M’Millan, the re-
presentative of the rich absentee importers,
would have had to pay more for his top-
hat and his other luxuries. Instead New
South Wales imported these things so
that the rich M‘Millan might get them
cheaply, and it paid for them by exporting
produce dragged out of the soil by white
slaves earning 15s. a week. Its yearning to
let the rich M‘Millan get his imported top-
hat cheaply was a truly pathetic circumstance.
If New South Wales had so far abandoned
its Freetrade policy as to put an absolutely
prohibitive duty on some article of which it
imported, say, £500,000 worth per annum,
and had manufactured that article locally
even at twice the cost of the imported sample,
it would still have been £500,000 to the good.
It wouldn t have needed to withdraw one
man from any other industry, for there are
more than sufficient unemployed to go on
with. It wouldn’t have needed to reduce
its production of anything, or its export
of anything, in the least. And it would
have prevented £500,000 going out of the
country—it could have borrowed for that
year and every succeeding year £500,000
less—it would have had £l5OO less interest
to pay by the end of the first year and
£.15,000 less interest to pay at the end of
the tenth year. The country is in the same
position as the individual. It is more profit-
able for the individual to pay himself £4 a
week for doing something than to pay another
man 15s. for doing it, and be unemployed
himself, and borrow the money to pay the
other man his 15s. The salvation of Aus-
tralia lies in unprofitable industries and high
prices.
King-government in Australia.
Mr. G. H. Reid has lately taken the view of his
position that its chief duty is to save the Govern-
ment from the consequences of sin. After waging
an unpatriotic campaign against a tariff, which
was as necessary financially as it was desirable
economically, he has helped the Cabinet
by direct support when it was sacri-
ficing the rights and liberties of Australia.
Premier Barton’s actions in regard to sending the
Federal Chamberlain cohentingent stamped him
as a man whose downfall was necessary to the
cause of political purity and Australian National-
ism ; but Mr. Reid cordially supported the
Government in that outrage on Parliamentary
government. The revelation that Mr. Barton
had either instigated or allowed Governor General
Hopetoun to usurp the functions and responsi-
bilities of a Cabinet Minister, and had thus dealt
a blow at the system of representative govern-
ment which the Australian people have won for
themselves, made the Democracy turn again to
Mr. Reid, expecting from him, if merely because
he is the man who is supposed to be always
against, the Government, the signal to rally the
forces in favor of self-government and Liberty.
The hope was absolutely vain. Mr. Reid
was faithful to the most contemptible traditions
of his political past, and artfully dissipated the
forces of protest and clouded the importance of
the issue by a mock parade of censure—with-
drawn without any attempt at indicating the true
position, but with many subtle half-falsehoods to
minimise its seriousness. Mr. Reid, in short,
drew the fangs of the Opposition.
* * * *
By a contemptuous disregard, of deliberate
betrayal, of its sacred trust, the Ministry had
practically restored the royal pi'erogative in Aus-
tralia to a power which has not been claimed in
England for. more than a century —which if
attempted in London to-day would probably cause
a. revolution. There was no doubt as to the posi-
tion. Australia had it on the word of Governor-
General Hopetoun himself. At two public
meetings he stated that he had been in
frequent consultation with Mr. Barton
as to the attitude of the Commonwealth in
regard to the S’African war; that the policy
of the'Government had been thus shaped in part
by himself ; that he approved of that policy and
took a personal responsibility for its adoption. It
was possibly a feeling of chivalry that led the
Governor-General into this “blazing indiscretion.”
Whatever it was, Australia lias reason to be
deeply thankful for the disclosure. If the
Governor-General is a member of the Cabinet —a
Cabinet in which the existence of so many
truckling Imperialists would make his member-
ship amount to an absolute mastery—it is well
that Australia should know the fact. The com-
plaint of Mr. Reid against the disclosure of this
King-government, his plea that if it had been
kept secret there would have been no great
harm, is a view of the situation that cannot
be too absolutely repudiated. If Hope-
toun is King of Australia, and rules the
country, as the Kaiser rules Germany, with
only a moderate restraint from Parliament,
there should be no concealment in the matter.
We have imagined that Australia was ruled by an
elected Parliament, with a selected Cabinet to
administer its decisions, and a Governor to give
them formal effect and to entertain title-hunters
and swash-buckling drapers at dinner. If this is
wrong—for it is wrong according to what Hopetoun
says—let the truth be known.
* * _ * *
Mr. Reid, in his artful defence of the Governor
and the Government, impressed the point that
Hopetoun’s speeches represented only an indis-
cretion, which would not be repeated, and that
the little lapse might be condoned under the First
Offenders’ Act. That was an entire misrepresent-
ation. Since the day of the Governor-General’s
arrival he has shown a disposition to assert, and
Mr. Barton to allow, powers utterly at variance
with the rights of a self-governing people At the
opening of the Federal Parliament he claimed the
right of veto on the election of the Speaker of
the House of Representatives. Tlie claim was
quickly withdrawn, but the fact of its being made
was an indication of his ideas as to the vice-regal
prerogative. A further indication was the
language (whether suggested by him or by Mr.
Barton) in which the preamble to the first Supply
Bill was drawn —language fit for serfs grovelling
at the feet of an Asiatic despot, but not
for the. free representatives of a free people
addressing a titled figure-head, employed for
convenience of government. Further, this
latest offence against Australian self-government
committed by Mr. Barton and Lord Hopetoun
in regard to the S’African contingent, was not a
single impulsive act, but a continuous offence.
Lord Hopetoun states that lie was in “constant
and anxious consultation ” with Mr. Barton.
They two, seemingly, formed the “inner
Cabinet,” and decided “ on their own,” first
not to despatch a fresh body of troops, and
afterwards to send a Federal 'contingent with-
out Parliamentary authority, and to break the
promise that Parliament would assuredly be con-
sulted in the matter. The First Offenders’. Act
cannot save a person guilty of a long series of
embezzlements, and Mr. Barton and Lord
Hopetoun, proved to have been in constant plot
against our liberties, may not beg its favor. The
position undoubtedly demanded the resignation
of both ; and a motion to that effect should have


come from the Opposition, from the Labor Party,
and indeed from the sub trdinate members of the
Cibinet itself, against whose privileges the Secret
Council of the Governor and the Premier was a i
serious blow.
* * * *
But so far there has been no such demand ; and
the incident has been allowed to pass as one of
trifling importance, to be well met with a few
serai-apologetic words. With almost the same de-
gree of indifference there has been allowed to pass
the incident of the Adelaide meeting to support
the policy of the British Conservative Ministry,
to attend which 3000 soldiers were drafted by the
Federal military authorities with the full approval
of the Federal cabinet. The right of public meet-
ing is one of the most jealously preserved of
British popular privileges, and the Common Law
hedges it round with many protections. Oho of
these is the long-established custom forbidding
soldiers in uniform to attend popular assem-
blies. It is obvious that- if the Crown
•can with impunity march its regular soldiers to
any place of public meeting, the right of meeting
vanishes, since every indicated place of meeting
■can be filled with soldiery. In Australia the right
of public meeting has been violated before this,
•but never more flagrantly than at this Adelaide
assembly, where 3000 soldiers were gathered by
authority to endorse the political actions of a
Conservative British Ministry. (It was subse-
quently cabled to Mr. Chamberlain that the
•meeting was the largest and most enthusiastic ever
held in S.A. —and no wonder!) But the protest
made by Mr. Watson, leader of the Labor party,
•was not pushed home, and the matter was allowed
to drop as one of small importance, or no import-
ance at all. If there is not a prompt recognition
•on the part of the Australian people of the danger
•of these deliberate encroachments on their
liberties, the future will hold a bitter awakening.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Farm-Burning and Other Matters.
The Sydney Daily Telegraph, of Saturday
(25th January), in reviewing “ With Rimington,”
by L. Marsh Phillips, late a captain in
Rimington’s Guides, quotes the following
Farm-burning goes merrily on, and our course through
the country is marked, as in prehistoric ages, by pillars of
smoke by day and fire by night. We usually burn six to
a dozen farms a day ; these being about all that, in this
sparsely inhabited country, we encounter. I do not
gather that any special reason or cause is alleged or
proved against the farms burnt. . . . Anyway, we
find that one reason or other generally covers pretty
nearly every farm we come to, and so, to save trouble,
we burn the lot without inquiry ; unless, indeed, which
sometimes happens, some names are given in before
marching in the morning of farms to be spared. . . .
The people are disconcertingly like English, especially the
girls and children—fair and big and healthy-looking.
These folk we invite on to the veldt, or into the little
garden in front, where they huddle together, in their
cotton frocks and big cotton sun-bonnets, while our men
set fire to the house. ... The women, in a little group,
cling together, comforting each other, or hiding their
faces in each other’s laps. In the background a number
of Tommies are seen chasing poultry, flinging stones, and
throwing themselves prostrate on maimed chickens and
ducks, whose melancholy squawks fill the air.
The reviewer, who is evidently shocked by the
outspoken brutality of the above, goes on to give
Capt. Phillips’ reason for taking a hand in the
war, and in this kind of ruffianism :
I am fighting for a United South Africa. A United
South Africa will, in my opinion, justify the war. . . .
If you want South Africa to ripen ultimately into a great
first-class world Power (and that is its claim), instead of
a bunch of fifth-rate antagonistic States, the first thing
to do is to range the country under one government, and
as a British Government will bp progressive, and a Dutch
•one will certainly be retrograde, you must put it under a
British one.
This is a curious explanation, to say the least.
Britain, according to this theory, fought for a
United South Africa. Yet Britain cared so little
for a United South Africa that it kept its own
South African possessions under many distinct
governments—in Natal, Cape Colony, Basutoland
(this formed part of Cape Colony for many years,
but the British Government, in its anxiety for a
Disunited British South Africa, arranged a separ-
ation), Rhodesia, the Uganda Protectorate, and
so on. Then the candid captain goes on to explain
further: —
As for the Uitlanders and their grievances, I would not
ride a yard or fire a shot to right all the grievances that
were ever invented. The mass of Uitlanders (i.e., the
miners and working men of the Rand) had no grievances.
I know what I am talking about, for I have lived and
worked among them. I have seen English newspapers
passed from one to another, and roars of laughter roused
by The Times telegrams about these precious grievances.
We used to read the London papers to find out what our
grievances were ; and very frequently they would be due
to causes of which we had never even heard. I never met
one miner or working man who would have walked a mile
to pick the vote up off the road, and I have known and
talked with scores and hundreds. And no man who
knows the Rand will deny the truth of what I tell you.
No ; but- the Uitlanders the world has heard of were not
these, but the Stock Exchange operators, manipulators of
the money market, company-floaters, and gamblers
generally, a large percentage of them Jews. They voiced
Johannesburg, had the press in their hands, worked the
wires, and controlled and arranged what sort of infor-
mation should reach England.
Now that Britain has gone so far that it is hardly
possible to draw back, the candid Jingo begins to
explain to her what a sill)’ tool she has been in the
hands of the wily German Jew speculators and
nigger labor employers of the Rand, and to tell
her that it was all premeditated swindle and lie
and steal from the beginning.
♦
A Matter of Pair Play.
Here is a truly notable extract from the speech
of Governor-General Hopetoun at the A.N.A.
demonstration in Melbourne: —
No one can accuse me of being wanting in patriotism.
There is nothing of the pro-Boev about me. In such
matters as this I am a real, good, old-fashioned Tory of
the old school. Whatever view I might have of any
quarrel in which my country was likely to be involved,
when once that quarrel had been brought to a head, I
declared, and my country would, in my eyes, be in the
right. (Cheers.)— Sydney Telegraph report.
By bis own showing, then, unless the report is
shamefully inaccurate, Governor-General Hope-
toun’s alleged opinion on the war, and the
alleged opinion of the whole Tory party on the
war, aren’t worth a straw. According to the above
statement, Governor-General Hopetoun and his
fellow Tories are not only ready to maintain that
the war,is justifiable, even if they know that it
isn’t justifiable, but they have their mental facul-
ties under such control that they can know that a
war is wrong and yet believe it to be right if only
it is a war in which Britain is engaged. After
that it is surely time to take down that blatant
signboard with the inscription on it about
“ British fair play.” If Hopetoun has been
correctly reported, he says most distinctly that,
so far as the dominant party is concerned, there is
no such thing ; that he is proud to say there is no
such thing; and that he has a whole-souled con-
tempt for anybody who gives way to “British
fair play ” or any such weakness ; and that the
statements of himself and his party are not worth
listening to so far as the war is concerned. Is
Governor-General Hopetoun prepared to repudi-
ate that disastrous report as a total misrepre-
sentation of his mental attitude ? If lie isn’t —
well, a viceroy who boasts of the one-sidedness of
his mind and the Tory mind generally, and the
utter valuelessness of his opinion and the Tory
party’s opinion on such a serious matter, is alto-
gether too frank for the kind of work that
Chamberlain and co. have on hand.

Our Awful Example.
This shriek comes from Tasmania, of all places in
the world, and appears in Launceston Examiner :
It is a common method to compare colonial debts with
national debts of old countries ; but I could point out
that there is all the difference in the world between such
national debts, which have been blown into nothingness
during war time, and Commonwealth indebtedness,
chiefly incurred in railway and other public works con-
struction. It’s just the difference between borrowing
money and spending it in fireworks and in building a
house. In the one case it has been blown into space ;in
the other we have an asset, the house.
This is the commonest form of consolation indulged
in by Australian people and politicians when they
want to satisfy themselves that it is quite safe to
go on the easy, slipshod process of floating loans
in order to avoid paying taxes. But the stag-
gering circumstance is that foreign States
didn’t blow all their debt into nothingness during
war-time, and that many of the foreign debts
are far better represented by railways and other
public works than the Australian debts are.
Mulhall and Coghlan supply some startling
figures under this head. Railways are the prin-
cipal national asset in all cases, and these two
statisticians show the debt per inhabitant of a
large number of States when the value of the
State railways is deducted :
Debt per inhabitant NOT represented by assets in

In almost every case there are miscellaneous
assets, such as telegraphs and the like, which help
to reduce the total, but, taking things all round,
Australia is about the last country which should
have anything to say about the use other countries
made of their loans, for it is almost the most awful
sample of the crowd. So far, it has borrowed
enough every year to pay the interest with—that
is to say, the influx of new loans makes up for the
outflow of interest, and generally leaves some-
thing over. Almost the only year when Australia
didn’t borrow quite enough to cover the interest
was 1893 —and consider the smash ! When this
country can get no more loans there is nothing to
prevent wages and general prosperity getting
down to the level of, say, Italy or Austria. This
country is even more badly situated than France,
for its debt is mostly held in France, so there is no
outflow of money. Also, French bonds are widely
distributed, and Jean Grapaud, in a vast number
of cases, just pays £3 taxes with one hand, and
gets back £2 interest on his rentes with the other.
The Claws of a Catmittee.
If the allegations made publicly in the Melbourne
press with regard to the catmittee management of
the Women’s Hospital do not force Premier
Peacock to take some very definite steps, then it
will show that gentleman to be an even more
tired and hopeless person than he is thought
to be. The facts in regard to the present
position have been already published—the decision
of the catmittee to close the institution against
pregnant women, fora time, for reasons which the
said catmittee of society tabbies considered
medically sufficient; and the protest of the
medical staff against this decision, as being,
on medical grounds, unnecessary and harmful.
All the responsible officers and servants of
the institution are on the one side, the cat-
mittee on the other. Since the point at issue is
purely a medical one, there can be no reasonable
doubt as to which party is in the right on the
main issue. But there are other issues. The two
resident surgeons, in a letter to the press, allege
against the catmittee :
morbid curiosity which is glutted by the prying investi-
gation into the private affairs of applicants for admission
at the weekly committee meetings. Why should a girl’s
inability to give a reference of character constitute an ex-
cuse for minute cross-examination by the ladies’ com-
mittee? It is a well-known fact that on this account
most girls are warned in a friendly way outside only to go
to the hospital at the last moment as urgent cases.
Two members of the committee have certainly inter-
fered with medical treatment in the wards. A little over
a month ago a woman in an urgent condition was sent
away by a committee-woman, and told to come back With
a reference. Only when an indignant inquiry came from
the Melbourne Hospital by telephone did the medical
staff here learn that such an outrage had been perpe-
trated. She had never been seen here by a medical man.
When apprised of the occurrence Dr. Lewis immediately
recalled her to the Women’s Hospital, where she was ad-
mitted for treatment.
Furthermore, why should members of a lay committee
patrol the wards as they weekly do, bursting into the
labor ward during confinements, entering the residents’
and students’ rooms without knocking, and altogether
behaving in an improper manner ? Surely it is time that
the committee acted as a committee, and not as a Royal
College of Surgeons gone mad ?
In another letter to the public press, one of these
doctors alleges against a member of the catmittee
that when she was informed of the consequences
of closing the hospital she remarked
If patients are going to oe confined on the doorstep,
let them be confined on the doorstep !
Yet another correspondent alleges against this
remarkable body of women that when his wife
was in the hospital as a paying patient she wrote
him in this strain :
Two officials, haughty, overbearing women, came to my
bedside, and asked me the following questions What is
your name ? Are you married ? Have you ever had a
before ? Now, don’t tell any lies. We believe you
have been here before. What is your husband, if you are
married (this said with a sneer)? Where does he live?
How much does he earn a week? Yesterday afternoon
some women members of the committee came and upset
me so much that I was quite ill and feverish for hours.
If you don’t come for me I will get up and risk all conse-
quences. I was insulted, humiliated, and called a liar by
those tyrants of women.
Other complaints generally current are that the
catmittee makes it one of the chief objects of
the hospital to collect facts in regard to the
“fall” of the unmarried patients, and that preg-
nant women in a serious condition have been
catecised about their lapses at a time when any
irritation was dangerous to life. To secure the facts
about the “fall” seemed, however, to be of moreim-
portance than to cure the patient. It is sometimes
safe to discount materially the complaints of hos-
pital patients, but in regard to this Melbourne
Women’s Hospital there is such an overwhelming
body of evidence from ex-inmates, and such
startling corroboration from the resident medical
staff, that it is impossible to avoid the conclusion
that the institution is conducted by the committee
on lines repugnant to all ideas of charity and
kindness, dangerous to the patients, and utterly
scandalous to the community.
;
The Hare-Brained Voting System.
Perhaps William Lyne has been flattered by
some ingenious clerk—with the Hare voting sys-
tem fad in a bad form—into the belief that if he
incorporates the weird and wonderful Mumbo-
J umbo affair into an Act of Parliament the public
will credit him with its comprehension. To have
the reputation of understanding the Hare voting
system is more to a man’s mathematical credit
than to pass an examination in Permutations and
the Binomial Theorem. Anyhow, the system (in
several clauses and some particularly gorgeous
schedules) appears in the Commonwealth Electoral
Bill, with as little apparent reason as the fly
appears in the amber. The lot of the electoral
officer, if Parliament is so foolish as to approve of
this cumbrous complication, will in future be a
happy one, as may be judged from the following
paragraphs of the second schedule of instructions
to him—taken at random :
The vote value of any such sub parcel of ballot-papers
on transfer to any candidate shall beat- the same ratio to
the vote value of the surplus as the number of ballot-
papers in the sub-parcel bears to the number of ballot-
papers in the parcel of the elected candidate.
Where two or more of such surpluses are equal, the
parcel of that candidate who had the greatest value of
votes at the count or transfer at which they last had an
unequal value of votes shall be first transferred ; and if
such candidates have been equal in vote value at all pre-
ceding counts or transfers the returning officer shall
decide which parcel shall be first transferred.
The vote value of any such packet of ballot-papers on
transfer to any candidate shall bear the same ratio to the
vote value of the surplus as the number of ballot-papers
in the packet bears to the number of ballot-papers in the
sub-parcel.
This is about one-fifteenth of one schedule. There
are various schedules, clauses, and supplementary
instructions. The only thing omitted (and The
Bulletin, on artistic grounds, resents the omis-
sion) is a clause stating that
If two or more voters are equal, each to each, and the
side of one voter is equal to the side of the other voter,
and the drinks contained by one are equal to the drinks
contained by the other, then the subtending angles
described by the one voter in making his way to the
polling booth shall be equal to the subtending angles of
the other ; and if the side of one be continued in-
definitely, it shall be parallel with the side of the other,
and these sides shall not meet ; for if they did they
would form a rhomboid, which would be absurd.
With the addition of such a provision, the Hare-
brained system (which is put in a peculiarly
aggravated form in this Bill) would be artistically
complete. It is indeed a sorrowful fact that
whilst there is real work to be done in Aus-
tralia—whilst in progressive legislation _ this
continent lags behind so many other civilised
countries; —politicians can be found to waste
time and energy on such faddery as this
Hare system of voting. From a close observa-
tion of the system in' practical working in
Tasmania, The Bulletin has come to the conclu-
sion that in nine cases out of ten it makes no
appreciable difference in election results. The
men who are returned after all this shocking
waste of good schedules, are generally the same
men who would have been ’ returned if the contin-
gent votes hadn’t been counted at all. The cry-
ing need is not for the mental destruction of
returning-officers, but for a little more solid com-
mon-sense among the voters, so that they will
recognise the folly of putting their patrimony in
pawn to the foreign money-lender, and of entrust-
ing the management of their affairs to loud-
mouthed jingoes and borrowers and title-hunters.

The Adelaide Tramways Grab.
This Saturday (February 8) the ratepayers of
Adelaide and suburbs have to vote on the pro-
posed Snow Tramways monopoly. Much energy
in rounding up voters is being expended by the
Snow crowd and the thousands of private tram-
way shareholders (who have already sold their
lines to the London shindykit on very advan-
tageous terms); and, when it is considered that a
large majority of the voters at this poll are pro-
perty owners, the voting for the proposed grab is
certain to be heavy. The one party which has
consistently opposed, and still opposes, this bare-
faced scheme is the Labor party, and the only
organised attempt to get the democratic voters to
the polls is being made by that party. None of
the many suburban corporations, which originally
made such a noise about a municipal trust, is
doing anything at all. It is little wonder that
Francis H. Snow’s London shindykit is freely
spending money. Railway Commissioner Pendle-
ton, who made extended inquiries, says the
Adelaide tramways can be converted for £980,000,
and return anything up to 10 per cent, profit. Had
Kingston remained in State politics the chance
of getting a return such as that would have been
eagerly availed of, but Jenkins sadly muddled an
excellent opportunity. S.A. can find money to
build railways in the sand that return less than
1 per cent., but when there is a 10 per cent, profit
in view the State won’t take it at any price. And
the present name of that amazing fool of a State
is Jenkins.
Sydney Telegraph i\i the interests of its friends,
the importers, barracks for a reciprocity treaty
with Canada, and in a recent issue it struggled
hard to produce a convincing list of articles that
the Canadians could be reasonably expected to
buy from us. It was a very ridiculous list. The
Telegraph assured its readers that we could send
butter, beef, poultry, hides, leather, etc., to a
country which is a huge exporter of butter, beef,
eggs, leather, and cattle, having more of them
than it wants. Also, Australia was to supply
woollens, machinery, “cheap boots” (cheap labor
boots, no doubt) and ready-made clothing to a
community whose manufactures are far ahead of
our own, and which is more likely to furnish us
with these articles, especially seeing that we don’t
anything like supply ourselves with them yet.
The Telegraph proposed that, in return, this
great, thinly-peopled land, instead of growing its
own food, should import flour, peas, apples, pears,
and vegetables from the Dominion. In its desperate
anxiety, to make a long list, it even suggested that
we should send flour to Canada as well as Canada
send flour to us—that the two States should swap
flour, in fact; and Canada was to sell us “ leather,
sole,” while we sold Canada “sole leather.” Of
course the Sydney middleman—the importing
person—would make a commission on this ex-
change of flour and sole leather. The great ob-
ject and purpose of life is that the middleman
may make a commission. But the Telegraph
went too far when it suggested that we should
send “ cheap boots ” to Canada and import “fine
boots” in return. The Australian isn’t a mere
ignorant Gibeonite who is only fit to make a
coarse three-and-sixpenny blucher. And, besides,
Canada is one of the most strongly Protectionist
countries on earth, and if heavy Protection en-
ables Canada to make “ fine boots ” at prices that
admit of profitable export to this country, while
partially Freetrade Australia has only risen as far
as to make the cheap blucher, then there is some-
thing wrong with the Freetrade theory.

N.S.W. Premier See and Vic. Premier Peacock
are still complaining about the “sovereign
States” of Australia not being properly repre-
sented at the coronation. It is time this childish
foolishness about N.S.W. and Victoria being
sovereign States was poleaxed. A “sovereign
State ” is defined by the dictionary as one that is
“independent of and unlimited by any other,”
and even the Commonwealth isn’t a “sovereign
State.” See and Peacock have got hold of a
large, silly, sonorous expression, which sounds like
a person of deficient intellect clanging a large boll
on a still night, but the expression has no meaning.
See also wants to know why small States like
Fiji and Ceylon should be represented, while
great ones like N.S.W. and Queensland are
not. The fact that N.S.W. and Queensland will
be represented by the Federal Premier is appar-
ently beyond the comprehension of the squalling
band of State politicians who are begging for
free victuals from the over-burdened British
taxpayer. Ceylon and Fiji must be repre-
sented separately or not at all, because they
have no Federal Premier to represent them jointly.
These things don’t go by size, else one or two of
the western electorates of N.S.W. could demand
a separate representative at the coronation
because they are larger than Fiji, and Queensland
might demand to send 25 representatives, all to
be fed by the British taxpayer, as against Tas-
mania’s demand for one. It is a squalid business —
this crying out for gratis board and lodging, after
the manner of a deadbeat breathing heavily at the
door of a benevolent asylum. It is calculated to
make the British people fancy that Australian
State Premiers don’t get enough to eat in their
own country.

The re-appearance of the plague in the dirty
Sydney suburb of Paddington led to an in-
dignation meeting called by the people to pro-
test against their own conduct in not being
clean. At that meeting Oakes, alderman and
M.L.A., explained why the council allowed
things to be dirty :
The difficulty of dealing with property structurally de-
fective was that an alderman so moving would be marked
by the property-owners. An alderman acting honestly
was more than likely to meet with defeat when he went
before the ratepayers.
And the average alderman, when it comes to a
case of bubonic plague—well, it seems he would
rather be a murderer than not be an alderman.
The property-owner wants dishonest aldermen,
and he can always get them—the supply is un-
limited. After all the talk about Australian valor
as displayed in the spruit and on the kopje, this
picture of a certain class of Australian as an
individual who dare not do right for fear of not
being an alderman is depressing. The best remedy
would be to have municipal councils elected on an
adult suffrage basis. When the property-owner is
a consistent elector of dirty and dishonest aider-
men it is evident that the property suffrage basis
is a bad failure.
Champion ingenuous item from Sydney D.T.,
which in a leader rages against the imposition of a
tax on steel rails:
When the Queensland Government granted authority
for private enterprise to construct railways, it was pre-
sumably in the belief that the public would be benefited
thereby. Unless that was the opinion of the majority, it
is difficult to imagine how the votes were passed in Par-
liament and allowed to stand after successive general
elections, as some of them have been. But now, because
the Labor party in Queensland is opposed to the
syndicates, &c., &c.
Of course Sydney D.T. (which never smiled on
• any Sydney tram-grab) doesn’t know, and can’t
imagine, how the votes were passed by the
unspeakably-rotten Q. legislature. Also, of course,
Sydney D.T. has never heard of Bulcockism, and
is utterly unaware of what a Queensland general
election means.

The circumstances surrounding the explosion of a
remarkable boiler were investigated at the con-
sequent inquest at Stawell (Vic.) recently. The
boiler was a second-hand affair, and had just been
fixed up to run a bush saw-mill when it went sky-
wards, taking the certificated engine-driver, an
ex-railway man, with it. It was shown to the
coroner and jury that, finding he could not raise
enough steam at a working pressure of 301 bs., the
driver put a wooden plug under the safety-valve
lever; this naturally swelled with the escaping
steam and jammed the valve; hence the inquest.
The boiler had neither a pressure-gauge nor test-
cocks. Though it was only good for a 301 b. work-
ing pressure the driver proposed to run it at
lOOlbs. ; and it might have been carrying
anything beyond that when it finally gave out.
It gave a day’s warning of its intention to
burst when the steam-pipe (from boiler to engine)
blew out, but no notice was taken of that
and the boiler had to kill somebody in the end.
Just before the last smash the water was within
1| inches of the boiler-top, and the pump was still
working freely. The most surprising thing about
the incident is that anyone was left alive to tell
about the wooden plug and the blown-out steam-
pipe and the absence of any means of testing the
pressure. The jury added a l’ider to its verdict that
the Government should have all boilers periodically
inspected and see that they are provided with
pressure guages and proper safety-valves. But
since there are boilers of the explosive sort all over
the State—especially in the bush (some of them
have been exploding with more or less fatal results
for many years past), the jury might have re-
turned a vei’dict of manslaughter against the
negligent Vic. Parliament without unduly strain-
ing its conscience.

An item from London Daily Express :
Northampton is the first English town to seriously feel
the wave of depression now passing over Europe. Seven
hundred men are out of work there, the unemployed
women are counted by the multitude, and two-thirds of
the factories are on short time. Hundreds of houses are
standing- empty, and thousands who, a few weeks ago, were
earning good wages are to-day existing on a few shillings
a week. In the streets men can be seen with pinched
faces, too proud to accept relief, who prefer to starve.
But it is on the girls that the suffering is falling most
heavily. Many of these live on wages of 10s. or 12s. a
week when in full work. Now, in factory after factory
their work is lessening, till some are not averaging half-a-
crown a week. Boot and shoe making, Northampton’s
staple industry, is feeling the full strain of foreign com-
petition and of lost colonial markets. The building trade
is still worse. The town authorities, while deprecating
panic, are taking measures to feed and help those in
want. Public works have been started, and no man who
has applied up to now has been refused.
Northampton lives on boots, and the imports of
American boots have grown so enormously in the
last year or two that the English industry is
falling all of a heap. The protected Yankee,
though he pays higher wages, undersells the
English bootmaker everywhere, and the latter is
getting on his uppers. By-and-bye, according to
present appearances, he will have to import
uppers to be on.

Lyceum “On Active Service.”
Palace “Why Smith Left Homo."
Criterion “A Life’s Revenge."
Empire Fuller Co.
Tivoli Rickards’ Co.
MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.

An operatic mosaic at Her Majesty’s on
Saturday night: Second act of “Otello,” third
acts of “La Boheme” and “La Giaconda,” the
Mad Scene from “Lucia,” then cheering, a rain
of roses, speeching, and the glory of the Italian
opera was one with last year’s waratahs. All the
{irincipals coruscated in the mosaic and won a
arge harvest of flowers, laurel wreaths, Italian
flags, sketches of Sydney Harbor, pictures of
cockatoos, parrots, and native bears, and tiny
boxes (contents not disclosed). One of the
swarthy men-singers got an ebony staff wreathed
with flowers and banded with paste brilliants.
Signorina Marcomini and Travaglini made a bril-
liant last appearance in the “ Giaconda.” The
former never sang better, and court dress and
jewels suit her so well that well, there are a
few unmarried princes in the Eternal City, and
The Bulletin will throw rice and confetti.
Signora Sapio was farewelled with wild, regretful
applause and a wealth of tuberoses and pink carna-
tions. She handed a little spray of red roses across
the footlights to Amadio, the magician of the flute,
who plays the solo in the “ Lucia ” mad scene. He
seemed surprised and dazed, but those directly
overlooking the orchestra saw that a ruby ring
went with the roses. It was very “pretty” of
Sapio, whose sweet mad singing and Amadio’s
magic fluting will be a bracketed memory through
the years. J. C. Williamson then beamed above
a pallid Alp of shirt-front and said a few words.
He thanked that huge audienco as representative
of Sydney’s appreciation of the grand works of the
Italian masters. Judged by the barometer of
the box office Sydney had shown that it is the
centre of musical art in the Commonwealth, On
not only his experience of the present enterprise,
but that of the Albani tour some years back did
he base his assertion. The Italian co. had given
216 performances in the three principal cities, and
121 of these had been in Sydney. The principals
of the co. left on Sunday night for a short concert
season. Chorus and part of orchestra are retained
for “Ben Hur.”
** * *
“ Ben Hur,” with great pomp and a mul-
titude of imported artists, is to rise in all its
glory at Her Majesty’s (Sydney) on Saturday.
“ Ben Hur ” is a great book ; whether it is calcu-
lated to make a great drama is another thing.
The howl and roar of the chariot race can’t be
staged except in a very modified form; all the
floor space of Her Majesty’s half-a-dozen times
over wouldn’t give that spectacle the space it re-
quires if it is to shout as Lew Wallace’s
book shouts at Antioch. Besides, Messala
can’t be trodden under the chariots every
night; Messala would wear out. The sea-
fight is a stage impossibility except on a
very small scale. The lepers on the Hill of
Offence wouldn’t look well, and the healing of
Ben Hur’s leprous sister would raise objections.
So would the Crucifixion. So would many other
things. When the things that are too large, and
the things that are too holy, and the things that
are too shocking are eliminated, it is difficult to
see that much remains of “ Ben Hur.” Still the
writer lives in hope, that being about the cheapest
place of accommodation obtainable now that rents
nave gone up.

“The Professor’s Love Story” will be
withdrawn from Sydney Palace this week
and on Saturday “ Why Smith Left Home ” is to
be revived for a few nights. Next Wednesday
Charles Arnold will say farewell to Sydney in
“What Happened to Jones.” Arnold is now a
man of bloated affluence, and is said to be going
out of the mumming business. His co. will be
transferred to the management of Willoughby and
Geach who, after a short tour of “ the provinces,”
open at Sydney Criterion on March 1 with
“The Wrong Mr. Wright,” another of the ex-
travagantly comic productions of Broadhurst.
The public which gave such a warm welcome to
the “Jones’’and “Smith’’plays will probably
show just as much fondness for “Mr. Wright,”
whatever his wrongness or rightness. The
Yankee-made domestic farce is like other products
of that energetic country —a good deal more up-to-
date than the domestic farce of any other land;
it is jewelled in more holes, has a better ratchet
action, and is generally a more finished product.
** * *
“ The Executioner’s Daughter ” still does
good work at Sydney Criterion, and the scene in
the telegraph office the night before Miss Helene
Burdette’s relations come to see her guillotined is
highly effective all the time. But after sorting
out its emotions, The Bulletin decides that the
purest and most enduring emotion of them all is
the one when the family puts on its best clothes
and its newest hat, and gathers round to see its
fair relative unjustly “scragged”—if the guillo-
tine can be said to scrag anybody. The scene of
the drama is laid in France, and most of the
characters talk pure English, which is supposed,
quite reasonably, to be pure French trans-
lated. But a certain waiter, during the first act,
in his struggles after local coloring, talks the
broken British of Leicester-square, London—just
as the Emperor of China might be reasonably
expected to order “ spling callot ” for dinner in
Pekin. Evidently that waiter wants to be
Frenchier than even his own country or his own
countrymen. It is as if the drama began with
good intentions, and then forgot to keep them.
Also, it is a sorrowful thing to meet with a High
Sheriff when no such official is known in France.
The way a foreign drama is foreign in patches
only is always interesting.
“ For a Child’s Sake ” goes off Sydney
Lyceum boards this Saturday to give place to a
military drama, “On Active Service.” Therefore
Miss Ada Guildford has but a little longer space
in which to take the part of the eccentric
lady who goes to a hunt in order to save the life
of the fox, and otherwise behaves in the manner
which, on the coast of Bohemia, lands one in the
large insane asylum where the dangerous lunatics
are allowed to roam about and set fire to things,
and the quiet ones are loaded with chains on
general principles. The asylum in “ For a
Child’s Sake ” is better conducted in this respect
than most of them ; and is merely burnt down by
the villain in a highly satisfactory manner. But
most stage homes for the cranky and the wild-
haired combust through the most dangerous
patient pouring kerosene on the property and
applying a match, whereupon it all goes up with
a whoosh.
** * *
Edward Farley’s one shilling concert at
Sydney Queen’s Hall last Saturday was a quiet,
refined kind of entertainment in which Miss M.
Harmer and Mr. Farley displayed good voices,
and no one displayed a voice that was really bad.
There was, however, a dreadful dearth of
originality in part 11. which consisted mostly
of illustrated song. The illustrated song never
gets much beyond “ The Village Blacksmith ”
and “A Ship on Fire”; sometimes, when in a
specially cheerful mood, it brings in “ The Old
Sexton ” and “ The Death of Nelson.” It was in
a cheerful mood at Queen’s Hall. Harry Leston,
in another burst of originality, recited “ The
Dream of Eugene Aram,” thoughtfully changing
“gyves” to “handcuffs” in the last line in case the
audience might not be educated up to “gyves.”
** * *
“Little Fanny Powers” made a distinct
hit at Sydney Tivoli last Saturday with imita-
tions. Public appetite for imitations seems in-
satiable. Fanny Powers hits off Marie Lloyd
best of all, and her imitation of that blue bird of
song is vastly more pleasing than was the original.
Gallando adds to his modelling sketches a very
passable one of Barton. Other items are just
about the same as before.
“ The Derby Winner,” which started at
Melb. Royal last Saturday on a three weeks’ run,
is the last production of Bland Holt’s present
season, the doubt concerning his Sydney inten-
tions having resolved itself into a certainty that
he will shift his forces to the Lyceum at an early
date.
• * • •
All things considered, “ The Derby
Winner ”is a suitable farewell function. Two or
three of the Holtian dramas from Drury Lane are
rather more imposing than this, but none of them
has a scene that thrills Melbourne’s innermost
soul like the auction sale of Walter Baker’s elderly
grey colt. The experienced 3-year-old was
knocked down to the Duchess for £25,000 last
Saturday, and the house applauded the transac-
tion with a warmth that was worth every penny
of the money. Subsequently the useful-
looking animal won the Derby, under a
welter weight, from four opponents; but
the race for the Blue Ribbon was received
in comparative silence, owing to the fact that
the stage manager had reduced the event to
a spasmodic procession along a narrow strip of
carpet. Miss Harris Ireland, as the lurid adven-
turess who vents her anger in an earnest
“ D —n ! ” is the most interesting feature of this
well-built melodrama. She hasn’t enough voice
or passion for such a part, but she is a
tall, intelligent Miss Harrie, and she com-
mands attention. Walter Baker is a vigorous
impersonator of a weak hero, Albert Norman dis-
tinguishes himself as theMajah, and Miss Brightie
Smith is a nice tearful young daughter of Brown. It
would be doing the drama an injustice to say that
Bland Holt is a fair suggestion of a romantic
johnnie who has been marked by a full-blown
duchess for her prey, or that Mrs. Holt is a little
bit like any other sort of personage than herself.
The comedy parts in “The Derby Winner” are
cheerfully murdered, in a theatrical way of speak-
ing, and the crime in Mrs. Holt’s case is aggra-
vated by her costumes and good looks. She pre-
sents a young and attractive appearance all the
time that Bland is expected to be the sort of
chappie who would sooner commit a breach of eti-
quette than marry her.
** * *
At Her Majesty’s (Melb.) the concluding
week of ** San Toy ” will be next week, and a
capital souvenir of the 50th performance is an-
nounced for Monday night. Last mention of
“ San Toy ” in this scientific journal omitted to
state that Howard Vernon, the favorite Japanese
Ko-ko of yore, had become Emperor of China in
succession to Hugh Ward on the latter taking
up the position of British boodler at Pinka-
Pong. The new Emperor adds nothing to
the gaiety of “San Toy,” but he has put about
five stone on to the original weight of the cast,
and the volume of sound at Pekin is largely in-
creased by his arrival. Ward continues to dance
an unofficial duet with Miss Chetwynd, and
Lauri is still supplying a rather laboriously funny
“ turn ” in the second act. In other respects,
Williamson’s tuneful comedy seems the same as
it was at the beginning, or perhaps a little
brighter. Anyhow, it is bright enough. “ The
Runaway Girl ” takes the floor on Feb. 15th.
* * * *
The date aforesaid has also been fixed for
the first production of Nellie Stewart and a new
dramatic co. in “ Sweet Nell of Old Drury ” at the
Princess’s. Meanwhile “Aladdin” presents the
tail-end of a strictly beautiful career to an approv-
ing public, the female portion thereof having been
notified that she will get only two more chances
to recline under the shadow of her matinee hat.
Which is to say * ‘ Aladdin ” terminates at about
11p.m. on Feb. 14th. Willie Perman, who was a
missing quantity in the Cake Walk for some time,
has now resumed _ his wild exertions, and the
Gotham Four are imitating a brass band and a
piano on the time-payment system.
** * *
The second of the farewell concerts by
Williamson’s Italian Opera Co. happens at Melb.
Town Hall to-night (Thursday), and all persons
desirous of hearing top notes delivered from the
chest with fervent vociferousness are invited to
attend.
*# * *
Also, Feb. 15 will bring the new company
of World’s Entertainers to the Bijou, where
Burglar Sweet and the present co. are appearing
for the last time on Saturday (Bth). From Mon-
day to Friday of next week a select combination
of cleaners and decorators will perform at the
Bijou, and the re-opening of the theatre is ex-
pected to be an impressive event with a profusion
of pot plants in the vicinity.
At the Melbourne Opera House a comedian
with a versatile face that laughs on one side of its
nose whilst weeping with the other is the
latest addition to the bill. The bill of Rickards,
nowadays, is more than satisfactory, and the stage-
management begins to show signs of an awakened
intelligence, but the fickle populacers don’t rush
the show on Saturday nights as they used to when
they had a First Part to rail at. Probably they
resent the removal of their grievance.

jobs ! No more “re-purchase for agricultural selec-
tion ” of private land which the Divisional Board
rated at 12s. 6d. an acre, the Crown Lands ranger
valued at £1 os. lOd. per acre, and for which-
Govt. paid S 3 13s. an acre, amounting to £22,622
—with the result that not one settler has come on
the property to date ! No more contingents to
Africa, supplied by the Govt, ring with inferior
forage at highest market price ! No more com-
missions for the stripling sons of Ministers ! No
more bribery and corruption ! “ Rigid economy !”
How on earth will the Philp Govt, maintain its
reputation ?
A well-known Melbourne firm (H. Newman)
voices a trade protest against the Federal Customs
regulation “demanding payment of duty on
watches and jewellery sent to Victoria from the
other States, whether such be samples for inspec-
tion or second-hand articles to be repaired and
returned to the senders.” Minister Kingston’s
new regulations certainly amount to a suppression
of the trade in jewellery and watch repairing—a
large trade according to The Bulletin’s
correspondent which has existed for years
between Victoria' and other States. Before
the Commonwealth Government took control
of the Customs there were reasonable checks
imposed upon the working jewellers’ trade. A
registered packet coming to Melbourne was
opened in the presence of a Customs official, who
made a book-entry of the contents before delivery.
On returning the watch, brooch, or what-not to
the sender (within one month from date of
receipt) the jeweller took the goods to the Cus-
toms officer, who cheeked them with the original
entry or entries. Goods forwarded to another
State on “appro.” were entered in the
same way, and came back duty free. For
no apparently just cause or reason the
present period of waiting for inter-State Free-
trade has been made a time of tribulation
for H. Newman aforesaid, and some, at least, of
his old customers. For instance, customer B
sends him a gold chronograph from Port Darwin
to have a special glass fitted. The Customs Dept,
refuses to give up the watch until duty—about £4
—has been paid on it, and the jeweller declines to
pay £4 for the privilege of performing a one
shilling job upon that timepiece. A large collec-
tion of packages, addressed to Melbourne jewel-
lers, are now lying at the local C.P.0., bailed up
for duty which never will be paid, and the owners
of the valuables, as well as the consignees, await
information from Minister Kingston re the why
and wherefore of this particular trouble.
There’s a crafty auburn lady, and a Majah, and a
horse,
A jealous wife whose husband likewise contem-
plates divorce;
A trainer and his daughter, erst a simple little
maid,
Till she listened to that Majah, and was cruelly
betrayed;
A Duchess and a doctor, who is something of a
dolt
(A pair of comic persons played by Bland and
Mrs. Holt);
An incidental spinster and a velvet-knickered girl
(The she-boy son and Viscount of the Countess
and the Earl);
A lot of scenes by Brunton, and a jockey, and a
mob
Of doubtful-looking noblemen employed upon the
job 5
These help “ The Derby Winner” in its efforts to
enforce
The moral that no woman is as worthy as a horse.
Now, the Earl of Baker’s gee-gee is an honest,
hardy grey;
He means to win the Derby, and he wins it all the
way ;
But the Earl of Baker’s countess makes for
jealousy and woe,
Whilst the auburn-headed siren uses langwidge
which is low,
And fools her patient lovers by suggesting with a
sigh
That if they keep on chasing they will catch her
by-and-bye.
The Duchess is a terror to the man she fain would
wed:
E’en the trainer’s lamb-like daughter would be
better were she dead.
Of all dramatic troubles lovely woman is the
source,
And virtue’s final triumph is completed by a horse.
The Wild Cat Column.
The Federal Government flatly refused to con-
mder the proposal of Senator Smith, of W.A., that, as the
tederal Public Service Bill required every Federal official
to assure his life, a Federal Assurance Department should
be established for that purpose. In this matter it showed
itself undemocratic, unjust, short-sighted and painfully
U *u^ 8 t ness^ like to boot. The Commonwealth has no more
• compel an y official to put his money into an in-
stituuon which may prove rotten, and leave him to stand
the loss, than it has to compel him to buy Lake View
shares. Further, if the public servants were insured in a
Federal institution, they would supply it with a
ready-made connection ; there would be no com-
mission to pay, practically no cost of collection,
and very little other expense. The concern could
be run at an expense rate of 4 per cent., therefore
it could give the public servants better terms than any
private office could possibly do. And the Federal Govern-
ment deliberately deprives them of these advantages—
advantages which only exist in their case because they
constitute the one class in the community with which
life assurance is compulsory. And Senator O’Connor, by
way of a dismally thin excuse, talked about the “ expense”
—as if the “expense” wouldn’t come out of the
premiums, as it does in all life offices.

The Perpetual Trustee Co. (Sydney) publishes a
very prosperous-looking balance-sheet for 1901. Here-
under the amount at credit of “Commission Reserved
Account ” now £B377—is included in the reserves, and
each year’s addition to it is reckoned in the profits. This
course was not followed in previous notices in this
column, but it seems to be the correct one :

1901 .. 5,021 8 ~ „ 2,000 268 21,920
The amounts written off were employed in writing down
furniture and premises. The Perpetual Trustee Co. is in
a prosperous condition, and its investments, which are
very fully specified, look thoroughly sound. At the
same time it has the bad habit of not stating income
from investments separately from the profits of the
trustee industry.
Some day, too, the Perpetual Trustee Co. will have to
seriously consider the position of its capital account.
Subscribed capital is £1,000,000, of which 125,000 is paid
up and £975,000 is callable. A shareholder is supposed,
in order to get 8 per cent on £lOO (i.e. £8 a year) to make
himself liable to pay £3,900 if things went seriously
wrong. This is very good for the man who knows that it
would be impossible to screw £3,900, or even £390, out of
him ; but it has a tendency to make people who could
pay up the liability keep clear of the concern. The lia-
bility may be exceedingly remote, but it is there, and
even remote things sometimes arrive. And the fact that
a considerable proportion of the shareholders are prob-
ably quite unable to pay anything like the liability makes
the co. all the more dangerous for those who can pay.
Further, the protection afforded to clients by the
£975,000 of callable capital isn’t anything like what it
looks ; only a few people who put £2OO in a concern have
£7BOO behind it that would be available in a bad time —
the only sort of time when it would be wanted.” The
Perpetual Trustee 00. would probably be about as safe,
and it would certainly be much more pleasant to invest
in, if it had £250,000 of paid-up capital and reserves
invested in the best Government securities and no
liability at all.

The directors’ report offers no explanation of this sudden
rise ; it preserves its usual calm despite the fact uhat the
profits have multiplied more than threefold in one jump.
As usual the Perpetual Trustees Ex. and A. Co. of Tas-
mania supplies far too little information in its balance-
sheet. The largest asset reads “Sundry Debtors,
£10,047” ; and the fourth largest, “ Investments, £2984.”
“Investments” might mean anything from the best
State securities down to a second mortgage on almost
anything. And as the £984 which have been added to
the reserves are all, and more than all, invested in “ Sun-
dry Debtors,” that item should certainly be more fully
explained. Further, the co. ought to show the return from
its investments separately, instead of lumping “ Com-
mission and Interest ” together in one item. It is growing
to be an affair of some size now, which makes this matter
all the more important.

Be the Commercial Bank of Australia’s recent
revelation, the following is the problem which concerns
the shareholders : It is estimated that the losses yet to be
provided for are something like £2,200,000. After writing
off the reserves and all the ordinary capital, except about
£67,000, there remains to be provided for £1,076,334.
Unless the rest of the ordinary capital, and part of the
preference capital of £2,117,230 are written off, this must
be provided for gradually out of profits. And after pay-
ing the preference dividend, how much profit remains, on
the basis of last half-year, to reduce this deficit. Last
half-year’s profits were nominally £72,460. The pre-
ference dividend absorbed £31,758, leaving £40,702.

Out of this an amount unspecified seems to have
been required to make up the interest on the
Assets Trust deposits—that concern about which
there is so little information. "Was there £40,000 or
£35,000 or £lO,OOO or what other sum left to reduce the
deficit ? And in that case, supposing earnings remained
at the present level, would the deficit be wiped off in 12
years or 15 years or 50 years ? And supposing all losses
were written off, and the Assets Trust and the bank were
amalgamated, would the half-year’s net profits of the
whole concern on the present basis be £72,000 or £67,000
or £42,000, or what? It is a curious thing that share-
holders should have to ask such questions about their own
bank, but the Commercial of Australia appears to be
built that way.

The Assets Realisation and General Finance 00. has a
paid-up capital of £128,280, of which £45,012 remains
intact on paper. There is nothing necessarily cheerful
about that fact; still it seems as if the co., after years of
consistent misfortune, might soon begin to show a profit
again on its general business. And if it does, and if it is
content to go slow, it might ultimately provide for the
rest of its depreciations and losses out of earnings. It
would be a very long process, no doubt, but still the
shareholders would have the satisfaction of knowing that
by keeping the wreck of their concern still above ground
they were at least providing billets for a few deserving
citizens.

“Investor”: Believe the investment is pretty
good, though not quite so good as you figure it out. You
must always allow for the fact that there must be an
overhaul of the institution’s position some day, and when
that happens it is possible that not only will all the capi-
tal disappear, but a portion of the deposits may have to
be written off as lost. Whether the latter event happens
or not depends on the future, which is a very uncertain
quantity. The market quotations will show you that a
good many people reckon a writing off not impossible.
You will almost certainly make a fair profit, but don’t
rely on quite so large a one.

December, 1901 5,400 8 ~ ~ 5,250 28,152
The reserves continue growing, though their progress
isn’t very rapid of late. The co. has considerably in-
creased its fleet during the last year, and as a result, all
its liquid securities have disappeared, and it has a bank
overdraft of nearly £2500. The Bulletin still holds that
it would be advisable to cut the dividend down to 7 per
cent., and accumulate a little more with a view to the
necessity for enlarging the business. The 8 per cent,
dividend is unusually liberal for a steamship co., though
it is a pleasant arrangement for the shareholders and one
that the management of a prosperous concern naturally
feels disinclined to interfere with.

The reserves are a miscellaneous collection: First a
special reserve created by the issue of shares at a pre-
mium, £466,536 ; ordinary plain reserve, £84,680 : reserve
for renewal of meters, £5725 ; and undivided profit,
£11,776. The co., however, hasn’t much in the way of
liquid securities, and, judging by the recent increase of
dividend, it has no idea of attempting very seriously to
accumulate a fund for the repayment of its great mass of
debentures at maturity. They are very expensive deben-
tures, too, the bulk of them carrying 5 percent, interest.
Presumably, when they fall due, it is proposed to re-issue
most of them—at a lower interest rate, if possible. A little
is certainly being done—that is to say, the co. appears to
have repurchased £50,000 worth out of the £848,000 —but
that doesn’t represent very rapid progress.

Melbourne Age has been angrily demanding a
reduction in Vic, railway freights on grain and produce, on
the ground that the rates are at least one fourth more in
Vic. than in N. S. W. But on N. S. W. railways grain and fi our
are carried at a dead loss (less than £d. per ton per mile),
and hay, straw, and chaff at a worse loss (about one-third
of a penny per ton per mile). The Department gets level
on wool, which is charged more than 2Jd. per ton per
mile. The Vic. Department can’t get level on wool,
for its wool trade isn’t large enough, so it can’t cut its
produce rates down to the N.S.W. level, and the Age
might as well stop swearing. In N.S.W. the average
wool rate is now higher than it was in 1883, while the
charge on everything else has been reduced enormously.

for a concern which has only existed for four years.

Sydney Harbor Colliery : Years ago, and long
before the big shaft was started, The Bulletin suggested
that before such a gigantic work was undertaken, other
bores should be put down, not only to locate coal-seam,
but also to ascertain how far it was dislocated by geo-
logical disturbances. Then there was the fact that one
of the two bores put down pierced a seam of burnt and
useless coal. The reply was in effect that this burnt
coal was purely a local disturbance, that it was an easy
matter to see the dyke on the surface, and that had the
bore been put in any direction a few hundred feet away,
this dyke would not have been met with and good coal
would have been dissected. Somewhat remarkable the
dyke was not found befol# the bore was started. Any-
how the co. went ahead with its main shaft, has spent
between £300,000 and £400,000 to date—a devil of a lot of
money to risk on a geological theory; and the seam
struck is utterly valueless. Of course there is good
coal ahead and there is no alternative but to drive for
it. Plenty of excuses are offered, but excuses are not
very consoling to the people who have lost their money.

June. The co., it is said, will accept the coke reduction
if made permanent, but asks for a further reduction on
matte. What it wanted was a5O per cent, reduction all
round. The Cobar mines are in a bad way generally
for want of water and for want of a better copper
market. The Occidental, after announcing that
it had enough water to last nine months,
shut down before it had been running half the
time. It has declared a div. with the last clean-up,
Better, perhaps, if the money had been used in deepen-
ing the dam another 10ft. The superficial area is enough,
but depth is wanted to minimise evaporation, which
is enormous in hot days with westerly winds, of which
Oobar has had an unusual number the last two months.
The Oobar Gold Mines’ return for the last month has been
published- about 1700 oz. ; value not given, neither work-
ing costs nor profits, so local shareholders are almost as
much in the dark as ever. The Great Western is under
offer. The Young Austral!a would probably like to be, and
is ekeing out a miserable existence for the want of a
better plant. The mine is good enough if the plant was
efficient. The option on the Cobar Chesney has expired,
and the co. has resumed possession with the intention of
completing the concentrating plant and further develop-
ing the mine.

Cobar Gold Mines, Ltd. : The English co.,
which took over the old Fort Bourke mine at Cobar and
put up no end of gear on it, including 100 head of stamps
and a £12,000 cyanide plant, reports that it crushed “ 7202
tons for 5390 z. 18dwt. gold, and c.yanided 3040 tons of
tailings and 1941 tons slimes for 12580 z. bullion. This
was all put through in December, but cleaned up in
January.” Why this co., which for two or three years
past has run its mill steadily without giving Australian
shareholders the slightest jot of information except once
a year, should suddenly start reporting progress locally,
is not clear. The 0.G.M., under all circs., won’t make
millions by turning out, say, £6OOO worth of gold or under
(its cyanide gold is not worth over £3 per oz.) monthly.
• ♦ • *
Araluen Central (N.S.W.) dredging co. : Over
1340 z. (say £540) for 131 hours’ work. But even at this
shares have not reached 20s. N.S.W. mining investors
have not yet learned to expect anything like continuous
luck on the part of any dredge.

The discharge of 140 hands from Baker’s Creek
G.M. (Hillgrove, N.S.W.), and stoppage of battery, after
all that has been written about several years’ supply of
pay-ore being in sight, comes as a severe shock to a lot of
people, especially as the cause is officially given as the
necessity of development with a view to ensuring a con-
stant supply of stone. As with countless other mines,
the rank and file of shareholders are permitted to know
precious little about their real position.
• * * •
Buckland River dredge : Said to have won
940 z. of gold for between 400 and 500 hours’ work. The
dredge master reports that the return is more than
satisfactory, which is equivalent to saying that the gold
is more than enough. As usual, the poorness of the
return is excused, and better yields are foreshadowed
when the dredge gets into deeper ground. All dredges
are always going into better ground. Some dredges
report weekly ; others that started by reporting weekly
are now giving monthly returns ; but dredges, like other
mining things, are judged from their divs. A few are
paying them, but, like the servant girl’s baby, they are
only “ little ones.”

At the annual meeting of the Sulphide Corpora-
tion, Chairman Kintore talking: “ Taking silver at 2s. 3jd.
per oz. fine, and lead at £lO 10s. per ton, the metallic
contents of a ton of concentrates are worth £9 14s. 6d.;
deducting from this £3 10s. 9d. for cost of production,
and £5 3s. 9d. for returning charge, a balance remains of
exactly £l, which sum, therefore, represents the margin
of gross working profit per ton of concentrates produced.”
A rise or fall of id. in silver means 2s. 6d. difference per
ton of concentrates, and a movement of ss. in lead means
3s. difference.
* * • •
At present the Broken Hill co.’s are giving
most attention to the kiln-roasting, or sintering, of the
up-to-now almost valueless slimes—the finest product of
the concentrating mills, rich in metals (say, 18 to 20 per
cent, lead, 10 to 20oz. silver, and 15 to 20 per cent, zinc),
but because of the heavy proportion of zinc and other
impurities and the fineness of the particles, “impos-
sible” as a smelting constituent. To use this pro-
duct the B.H. Prop. 00. has constructed sintering kilns,
the main object being to desulphurise it, and thus pre-
pare it for smelting. In consequence mainly of a differ-
ence with the Silverton Tramway Co. as to freight, the
work of kiln-roasting has thus far been carried out on the
mine. Economically, the experiments are said to have
been a great success ; but otherwise Broken Hill declares
them an insufferable nuisance, on account of the heavy
fumes thrown off, which are fast destroying what little
vegetation has been encouraged. The co. promises
to go further away in the future; meantime the
three huge kilns prepared must burn out. Broken Hill
has, therefore, the keen satisfaction of knowing that it
won’t have to swallow much above 250 tons morS of
sulphur, arsenic and lead this time. These experiments
must not be tangled up with the Carmichael, and other
processes for desulphurising concentrates. These latter
are more elaborate and less wasteful of metal, but are
probably not applicable to this grade of stuff. The Car*
michael process, by the way, is now being tested away
from the mines.
• * • *
B.H. Prop, directors claim to have made “a
saving on working costs of a sum approximating £34,000”
in the half-year—this as a set-off to the fall of over ljd.
per oz. in price of silver and 31s. lid. per ton for lead.
The position does not, however, when one comes to pick
into it a bit, seem quite so comforting as it looks on the
surface. For —mixing the metaphors—if there has been
a saving at the tap there has been a loss at the bunghole.
Look at it this way : Last half-year’s silver output was
3,009,1640 z., compared with its predecessor’s 2,683,9460 z. ;
ditto lead, 30,457 tons, against 27,869 tons. Gross profit
for the half-year was £56,293, against £102,506 in the
previous half. At last half-year’s rate of production the
profit in the previous half would have been about £112,000
instead of £102,505. On the basis of equal production
that would mean a fall in profit of £55,800. The metal
slump meant a loss of £68,500. Therefore the net saving
was the difference between these two amounts ; in other
words, £12,700. If £34,000 has been “ saved in working
costs,” £21,300 of it has been mopped up somewhere —in
bigger expenses elsewhere, by poorer extraction, through
poorer ore, or somehow.
* * » *
This is the day of big things. Out of the heavy
fall in silver and lead comes a suggestion by Mr. Harvey
Patterson for the amalgamation of all the Broken Hill
co.’s, which would effect a saving of hundreds of thousands
annually
Like the rest of the silver-lead mines,, the
King Conrad, one of the John Howell group on the old
Bora Creek (N.S.W.) field, wants a gold-mine for a part-
ner these times ; and a call has been made for £4OOO
more capital. An appeal to the vendors for help has
been more successful than it was in a recent other
notorious case.

Iron deposits in the vicinity of Orange (N.S.W.)

Lake View Consols (W.A.): Chairman Govett
has cabled to London that the manager, Hartman, had
resigned ; that there was no possible excuse for his con-
duct ; that after intimating that there would be no diffi-
culty in maintaining a gold production of 14,0000 z. per
month, he had to admit that the January return would
only be 12,0000 z. “He has suddenly reduced this to
8000 oz. Shareholders must not conclude rashly ; trust
they will give time to form just estimate of great possi-
bilities of mine.” Govett now says that M'Kinnon’s
explanation of the points he commented upon in his
speech before leaving London was perfectly satis-
factory, and as results had already justified
M’Kinnon’s estimate and recommendations, he
(Govett) was very sorry that he had spoken as
he did. He had also arranged with Bewick, Moreing and
Co. to examine the mine, and to afford them every
facility he had placed the management in their hands
until he returned to London. A few words about
managers and management. Last month Whittaker
Wright, in his examination at the Bankruptcy Court,
declared that Manager Callahan and the war had
brought about the collapse of the London and Globe
Company. Collins, the man who succeeded Callahan, is
bringing an action against the London and Globe Com-
pany for breach of contract, also a few weeks ago it was
M'Kinnon and not Hartman that would likely resign.
The Board’s confidence was in Hartman, because M'Kin-
non’s figures were too low, and it was given out that the
latter would have to leave in April. Now Hartman has
got to go and M'Kinnon remains as consulting engineer.
The putting of the mine into the hands of Bewick
Moreing is going deliberately from the frying-pan into
the fire, and the only consolation shareholders have is
that there are no deep-level propositions to take in, as in
the case of the Sons of Gwalia, nor are there any adjoin-
ing wild cats to acquire at high figures, as in the case of
the Brownhill. The drop in the gold output is not
altogether unusual, either. In Callahan’s time it fell
from 30,0000 z. one month to ll,ooooz. the next, and after
a time it fell from ll,ooooz. per month to 5000 oz. It was
then brought up to 14,0000 z., and, according to the
chairman, the January production would be only 8000 oz.
There has been a depreciation of nearly £750,000 in share
values during the last few weeks. That is not unusual,
either. They reached £2B on one occasion and then fell to
£2O, and from £2O to £lO, and they are now down to £4 ss.
The bears who made a million out of a previou s collapse
will probably repeat their experience in this. Govett has
said that on'his return he will at once advise the London
Board to allow visitors to examine the mine as soon
as Bewick, Moreing and co. have completed their
work. Why doesn’t he go the whole hog, and tell the
shareholders that the mine is bad in the bottom, that no
ore payable under existing conditions has been found
below a certain level, and that at the present rate of
working a few months will exhaust all the available re-
serves ? That is the next shock they have to face.

Paringa Consolidated : A mine occupying a
block of ground quite outside the Golden Belt at
Hannan’s. Having a remote hope of picking up the
Brownhill, or some other lode, it has spent many a
thousand without success. As it wants further capital,
another reconstruction is proposed. Some time ago
some people with more money than sense agreed to lend
this company £20,000. Of this sum £16,000 has been
already advanced, and the people with more money than
sense have declined to put up the balance except' under
conditions which the directors refuse to accept.

Westralian mines: Wired that Kaufmann, be-
fore leaving again for Europe, spoke appreciatively of
conditions at the big mines, and of the progress made with
the commercial treatment of sulphide ore. “ His faith in
Westralia is unbounded, as shown by the fact that all he
possesses is invested in its mines.” The pressman omitted
to wire that all he possesses came out of them. “Of course
he had interests in some duffer propositions which, how-
ever, he regarded very complacently in view of the
magnificent appreciation in value and the permanent
character of others.” Writer wonders what shareholders
think who managed to invest in Kaufmann’s duffers only.
Mr. K. thinks it would not he to the best interest of
mining industry to make the Kalgoorlie mines more
accessible to visiting shareholders. “ Australian share-
holders,” he says, “ have little conception of the uses
made on the London Stock Exchange when such per-
mission was granted.” Kaufmann is entirely wrong, and
perhaps his object in shutting visitors out is to better
play his own game. The Great Boulder, which
is the most accessible mine to visitors out there, is the
least-manipulated on the London Stock Exchange, and
the Lake View, Perseverance, and one or two others
which are absolutely inaccessible to visitors, are the very
mines the manipulations in the stock of which have
become a public scandal. Kaufmann says the Coolgardie
water-supply is hopefully waited for. Not much in that",
also steps were being taken which would certainly lead
to the great cheapening of mining supplies, more especi-
ally dynamite, the price of which would be arranged on
the Rand basis. If Kaufmann brings this about he will
do a great public good to the mining industry of Austra-
lasia which has long suffered from the dynamite monopoly,
quite as much as the Rand when Kruger bossed it. There
it was one of the alleged reasons for the war (on the
whole, mind vou, mining conditions on the Rand were
far easier than in Australia), but in Australia never a
voice was lifted against it. Some years ago the writer
was the indirect means of bringing an American dyna-
mite man into the country with the object of smashing
this monopoly. After landing some' thousands of
cases of American-made dynamite, that Yank was in-
duced to get out of Australia ; in compensation a big
European dynamite firm agreed to get out of Mexico,
thereby giving the Americans control of that trade.
Dynamite is made in America for from six to 12 cents per
lb., and is sold according to grade from 12 to 25 cents per
lb. Probably it is made even more cheaply in Germany ;
and yet Australia has had to pay a retail price equal to at
least four times the cost of manufacture.

Westralia’s one substantial copper-producer,
the Anaconda, at way-out Murrin Murrin, hangs on in
spite of the slump. The December yield was 62 tons
metal from 710 tons ore ; total in its life of a little over
12 months : 922 tons copper from 12,472 tons stone.

The Long Tunnel Extended (Walhalla), for
years the high-flier among Vic. mines, has got into divs.
again after 12 months tribulation. Profits, however, are
not going to be what they used to be ; and, anyway,
shareholders are not going to get the whole of them,
because the directors, scared by the tight place they have
ust pulled through, have decided to build up a reserve
und straight away.
So successful has South Australia’s produce
export depot been, and so many extensions have been
called for, that now 500,000 carcases of lamb or mutton
can be prepared for shipment in 12 months. There is
corresponding provision for handling fruit, wine, &c.
Last year 110,000 gals, of wine shipped from the depot
were sold through the London agency, as against 30,000
gal. five years ago. The depot is paying 5£ per cent, on
capital. Yet, with that and a dozen other good examples
of successful State enterprise under its nose, this is the
very community that smiles on the awful Snow tramway

So rapidly has the use of artificial manures
grown among S.A. farmers that on the crop just har-

This season the same fertilisers have been used for the
first time by potato-growers—Senator Playford was the
experimentalist in this case—and it is said that the results
were good.

Burra, a once-famous town some 100 miles
north of Adelaide (S.A.), has had many ups and downs
since the good old days of the Burra Burra copper-mines.
During the past 20 or 25 years it has kept from starving
mostly by the aid of its monthly stock markets. However,
recently a few of the very few South Australian mining
speculators led some of the inhabitants into a syndicate,
and got together a few thousands of pounds with a view
to “ doing something ” with the old Burra property. It
called itself the Burra Burra Copper Co., and it made
arrangements with another syndicate, run by the much-
talked-of Snow, of the Snow tramway business, to treat some
thousands of tons of tailings and other surface stuff by a
new electrical method of ore reduction. But neither the
Snow crowd nor the copper co. has done anything as yet.
The new company declared itself formed with far too
small a capital to do much good at Burra, while the
slump in the price of copper has apparently snuffed out
all remembrance of the Snow deal. Just now Burra is
nearly in its coffin financially. The Slag Extraction Co.,
which erected a plant some time since to treat the great
heap of slag dumped down by the old copper co.’s
smelters, has run down, and the working population is
now dependent on a spasmodically worked Government
ballast-quarry and a brewery, these being the only places
where labor is needed, unless there is included the casual
job of cutting a bit of wood in the back yards of a few
pubs, which are also struggling against the troubled
times. Poor old Burra Burra!

“One result of the extremely slender stream of immi-
gration from the Old Country for many years past is that
year by year the political control of both Commonwealth
and States is passing rapidly to the native-born. But
this fact does not cause alarm , because the native-born,
British in their blood, are as British as their fathers were
in their loyalty.”— Argus.
A convoy has been surprised and captured
with remarkable dash at Port Adelaide. It
wasn’t a Boer convoy, however; only the manager
of Block 14 smelters and his assistant in a pony-
trap with £l2OO, the fortnight’s pay for the men.
Two horsemen met the trap. “ Both were armed
with revolvers and heavily masked, and rode
good-looking horses.” The driver of the trap
•“kept the horse moving” after he was told to
“ bail up,” but one of the captors shot the pony,
and that threw the two men out. Mr.'
Winter, the assistant-manager, says he “tried to
turn over to get at the revolver heal ways carries, ”
but he was covered, and forced to throw up his
hands. He threw them up enthusiastically. A
man who carries a gun and only begins to feel for
t at that late hour has very little show, unless he
leets a very slow robber indeed. The police

The Jewish sect, like the Roman Catholic,
has the wisdom not to wash its dusty linen in
public. If internal dissensions arise they are
smothered as far as possible. Just now there are
rumors of grave trouble among the Victorian
Jews and of serious charges formulated • against
the Beth Din, or governing body of Judaism
there. What is the exact nature of the trouble a
Gentile may not know, but there are awful
allegations re the inefficiency of the Kosher meat
supervision and other matters of grave import to
Jewry, and the Chief Rabbi is understood to
threaten very serious things indeed if steps are
not taken. What steps should be taken in such a
case is another matter that is beyond Gentile ken.
When trouble arises among Presbyterians or the
like, 128 perspiring reverends argue the matter
to a finish in a hall, till their collars become too
limp for public inspection, but they do things
differently in the places adjacent to the Dead Sea.

The houses in New South Head Road,
Sydney, wherein occurred the recent recrudes-
cence of the plague, are attractive-looking enough
in front, but behind them is a cluster of slums
built on an old rubbish heap, and a little further
back, nearer Darling Point., is the pretentiously-
named Hampden Park, which, not many years
ago, was the corporation tip for Paddington and
Woollahra. The place has long been one of Syd-
ney’s whited sepulchres—the whitewash facing
the main street and the sepulchre behind ; and,
behind the sepulchre, the swamp with its open
drains carrying into Rushcutters’ Bay all the con-
centrated foulness of the disused tip. A daily
paper says :
Several of the houses in the neighborhood were in a
condition which rendered them unfit for human habita-
tion. The rooms used as bedrooms were often without
windows, or other ventilation openings excepting the
door. The flooring in many cases was rotten or was
gnawed by rats, and the space between the floor and the
ground was filled with rubbish. Dead rats were found in
several of the houses on the flooring being removed.
The premises were often very dirty, and the yards
littered with rubbish.

and passengers go inside for a cup of tea (it is always “a

The vagaries of the Licensing Bench at
Sydney “no fellah ” can understand. The other
day, in face of the Local Option vote, permission
was granted to remove a license in Macquarie
Ward, though the Local Option vote was against
removals. Recently the Bench refused a license
for a 37-roomed house in Margaret-street, Wyn-
yard-square, on the ground that the reasonable
requirements of the neighbourhood did not call
for it. There is only one hotel in the immed-
iate neighbourhood. A couple of weeks ago it
granted an extension of license, whatever that
may mean, to G. Adams, of Tattersall’s, Pitt-
street. This extension enables Adams to open—
as advertised —two bars on George-street, where
the thirsty can get drinks at every fifty yards.

A troopship which arrived in Australia
not long ago took on board at Capetown certain
exalted Australian officers and about 100 Aus-
tralian soldiers, many of them belonging to
irregular S’African corps. As the officers came
on board, the captain of the ship asked the senior
if he was in charge of the men, but he and his
mates retorted haughtily that as to the
irregulars they had nothing whatever to do with
them. Desirous of having someone in authority,
the skipper then addressed the men and asked
them to appoint two of their number to hold com-
mand. The men held a hasty election, and the
captain took the two chosen delegates aft and
gave them berths in the saloon. That evening at
dinner, when the officahs entered, they nearly fell
down in astonishment at finding two common
rankers at the table ; and, when they recovered
their self-possession, they intimated to the captain
that they would not, under any circumstances, sit
down to meals unless those two lowly warriors
were removed. The skipper’s patience was ex-
hausted. “Do without!” was his response; and,
after missing one meal, the officahs crawled down,
and for the rest of the voyage fed sullenly beside
the grinning privates.

Sydney news-clipping :
Yesterday 14 invalided soldiers returned by the Aus-
tralasian, which berthed at Smith’s Wharf, Miller’s Point,
about 11 a.m. Owing to some misunderstanding, or
oversight, no official was present to receive them, and the
men, tired of waiting, at length left the ship on their own
account, and found their way into the city. The majority
of them being invalids, and without means, &c., &c.

“D.W.” concerning the Melb. Women’s
Hospital trouble: —
For years past a cataclysm of the sort has been ex-
pected at the hospital by those who have studied the
committee. A couple of years back it made a scapegoat
of a capable and resident medical' officer to cover its own
faults of omission. Later on. it flew in the face of public
opinion and lost heavily in subscriptions by perpetuating
the labelling of unmarried mothers in the wards. On all
occasions it has displayed unnecessary callousness in
dragging out of applicants the details of their “ fall ” ;
and for years the committee meetings have been such
tragedies that it has been found necessary to more or less
gag the daily press by securing relatives of the proprie-
tors as members. The conduct of these committee meet-
ings has been unlike that of any other managing body of
the sort. Not content with posing as the superior Lady
Bountifuls dispensing charity to the peasantry, several
aggressive members have conceived the idea that
their position demands (and implies) a knowledge of
medicine and surgery. The wards are visited by the
members, cases are studied, and, most extraordinary fact
of all, treatment is dispensed by them ! During the
present embroglio an instance was recalled of a com-
mittee-woman saying that the instructions of, perhaps,,
the most eminent obstetrician in Vic. were “ all fudge
and nonsense,” and that his orders for massage were to
be set aside in favor of hot fomentations ! At the com-
mittee meetings this feeling predominates. The honor-
ary staff —the leading men in their profession—are lined
up like small boys and subjected to detailed cross-exam-
ination by the amateur surgeonesses. The main cause of
the quarrel is the method by which the committee keeps
its position. In the memory of the present generation,
there has not been a contested election. When one mem-
ber drops out another is appointed—very frequently a
relative of an existing one. The little clique which pre-
dominates has been too strong for any stranger to oppose,
especially as it holds an immense number of proxies from
English subscribers, and as the general body of local sub-
scribers has taken very little interest in the institution.
The present trouble, is, however, the best thing that
could have happened to the hospital. It has aroused
public interest. It has brought to a head the simmering
hostility of the medical profession, and it is very ques-
tionable whether any doctors of first rank will now be
found willing to take the vacant places. The objection
which prevented opposition at elections no longer
holds. There are two defined sides, and it would not
need a very big effort to successfully run candidates

Women’s Hospital evidently mistook the recalci-

—“Tell him personally; if he were in my house

No less than nine Chinese tried to land in
Melbourne on exemption papers, the other day,
from the Kumano Maru. All were supposed to
have merely been home for a holiday, but as their
knowledge of Melbourne was as curious as a Free-

NO CAUSE FOR ALARM.
The native-born Australi-an
Is spreading o’er the land ;
The native girl for native man
Is largely in demand.
This Commonwealth was meant to be
A native baby-farm:
Proclaim the fact complacently—
It causes no alarm.
The Government of every State
Where natives grow and toil
Has, strange to say, become of late
Quite racy of the soil;
But still the Argus, old and grey,
Good, anxious British inarm,
Can note the truth without dismay—
It gives her no alarm.
For whilst the natives shout and sing
Britannia’s name and fame,
And help the Soldiers of the King
To feed the Jingo flame;
Whilst “ Loyalty ” maintains its spell,
And titles work their charm,
Our native rule serves Britain well—
It causes no alarm.

lexpocted fulfilment of a healthy,
vigorous curse lately occurred in connection with
e barque Ashmore. At Lyttelton (M.L.) some
oilskins, placed temporarily in shore trucks, went
astray, and the raging owner, unable to get satis-
taction, stood on the wharf when the boat was
eaving and dealt out lurid language to all and
sundry ending with the hope that the man sus-
pected (and quite innocently it transpires) should
a from aloft, break his neck, or tumble into the
sea. _ Alter a few weeks, while the watch was
furling a sail, the man in question, through no
apparent cause, fell from the yard, struck the rail,
fell overboard and couldn’t be picked up. The
owner of those oilskins should now have something
heavy on his mind.

Nothing more has been heard about the

the monotony of his other violence by banging

which has befallen this outrage since the day it
got into print is a severe disappointment to a
thoughtful public.

Extract from a letter of the war-corres-
pondent of the London Daily News and Liver-
pool Mercury, who fell into the hands of the
Boers as a wounded prisoner:
Our men,
when woun-
ded, are
treated by
the Boers
with manly
gentleness
and kindly
considera-
tion. When
we left the
laager in an
open trolly,
we some
half - dozen
Australians,
and about as
many Boers,
were driven
for some
hours to a
small hos-
pital, the
name of
which I do
not know. It
was simply a
farmhouse
turned into
a hospital for
the wound-
ed. On the
road thither
we called at
many farms,
and at every
one, men,
women and
children
came out to
see us. Not
one taunting
word was ut-
tered in our
hearing, not
one braggart
sentence
passed their
lips. Men
brought us
cooling
drinks, or
moved us
into more
comfortable
positions on
the trolly.
Women with
gentle fing-
ers shifted
bandages or
washed
wounds, or
gave us little
dainties that
that come so
pleasant in
suchatime; whilst the little children crow uv-Lounduswith
tears running down their cheeks as they looked upon the
blood-stained khaki clothing of the wounded British. Let
no man or woman in all the British Empire, whose son or
husband lies wounded in the hands of the Boers, fear for
his welfare, for it is a foul slander to say that the Boers
do not treat their wounded well. England does not treat
her own men better than the Boers treat the wounded
British, and I’m writing of what I have seen, and know
beyond the shadow of a doubt.
Not a word about green paint as a Boer medical
comfort !

tokens of inward grief on the first anniversary of

The Religious Tract Society (London)
draws attention to the fact that its new illustra-
tions of holy personages have “no halos.” The
Eietorial halo, suggestive of a bush fire on the
ead, is evidently doomed. Even the colored
saint on the church window will have to be
content with an ordinary bare head in the ages to
come. The ridicule of scurrilous weekly news-
papers kills every ancient absurdity sooner or
later.
There is a movement in Adelaide (emana-
ting from the W.C.T.U. coterie
of pietists) to rigidly examine
the private characters Of all
future municipal and parlia-
mentary candidates, and an
expectant public yearns for the
results. If the inquiry be im-
partially
conducted
some very
holy per-
sons of the
snuffle-
haunted city
will sit up. One
prominent and
intense saint, for
instance, is
known to be the
landlord of a
notorious row of
tenements,
where the
Flossie pays
rents such as
couldn’t be ex-
tracted from
any respectable
citizen or
citizeness. If
all the illicit
sinners in
political life
‘ were to resign
to morrow, Par-
liament would
probably have to
adjourn for want of
a quorum. And if
the crowd which
is inquiring into
the morals of
Parliament
was itself in-
quired into it
might possibly be
left without a
quorum also. It
would be an interesting
( ■ experiment to send a tele-
gram simultaneously to all the
members of a Social Purity Society telling them to
fly because the dreadful truth had come to light
and there wasn’t a moment to lose, and see how
much of the Society would be missing next day.

A meeting was held in Adelaide last week
to assure J. Chamberlain that the great heart of
S.A. is with him in his conduct of the war in
S’Africa (Salisbury apparently doesn’t amount to
anything nowadays). And, as was fitting and
seemly, the convener and chairman was Cohen,
and the resolution was moved by Jacobs. The
present war has been one long repetition of Cohen
and Jacobs.
* * * *
Sydney got some slight idea of what a
cavalry charge is like, one night last week, when
about 400 horses stampeded from the military
encampment at Moore Park, and cutting across
the backblocks of Paddington and Woollahra
entered the city by Upper William-street, after
sundry adventures with a cable car at Rushcutters’
Bay. Some 50 dashed down William and King
streets through the heart of the city, and came to
a stop at the ferry-gates at the bottom of King-
street, where they playfully kicked a couple of
tram-cars to ruin. The rest poured along Dar-
linghurst-road, which was crowded with children,
and distributed themselves through various side
streets. Several were injured, and one large
black animal struck an iron railing and turned a
somersault right over it in among a crowd of men,
boys, and policemen. The way the crowd scat-
tered was fast, and the things it said were violent.
Why the horses stampeded is a mystery, the only
explanation given being that two dogs started
barking. Before the last Bush Contingent left
Sydney there was a stampede of horses, and
although they were branded on the flank, and had
the broad arrow burned into the hoof, about 50 of
the most valuable were never recovered. At time
of writing there are again about 50 horses not
recovered.

THE USUAL FOOL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He was a fool
(Just the usual fool)
Who mashed the girl in the bar,
Shouted her flowers,
Whiled away hours
Telling of travels afar.
She was a girl
(With the usual curl)
Hanging coyly down from the rest,
Who listened and joked
And playfully stroked
The fool on his spotless vest.
Now, being a fool
(And the usual fool)
To whom life was a casual jest,
He took the bait
And he knew—too late—
That he was a fool like the rest.
And now he’s a fool
(And an old, dull fool)
O, I speak these words in warning,
And a dull stout girl
With a greasy curl
Is that prize of his young life’s morning.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, February 4, 1902.
My Dear Arini,—
Sydney’s farewell to the Italian opera co. was
warmer than the night ■on which it was made.
And that night’s warmth was about the tempera-
ture in which pineapples are raised. Never have
I seen an audience so full of zest and—yeast.
And so crowded was it that long before the cur-
tain went up not even a spook, let alone another
body, might find space.
Flowers are very scarce in Sydney these days.
A most ordinary posy is more expensive than a
quart of Pommery, yet at the farewell on Satur-
day night the principals were ankle-deep in
flowers. Every cheer and recall was punctuated
with blooms. Tuberose predominated, I think ;
at least its perfume did. Shelley said the tube-
rose “ is the sweetest flower for scent that blows,”
didn’t he ? Well, he couldn’t have inhaled
it from the bushel—besides, he wanted a rhyme
for “blows.” When all the principals had been
recalled often, and again, and some more, and had
carried away all the flowers save single ones'and
buttonholes, they lined up and made a background
for Mr. Williamson and his speech. J.C.W.
stroked Sydney’s fur from head to tail-tip : she is
purring yet ! Then he stroked the other great
cats of the Commonwealth slightly the wrong way.
To their lack of musical appreciation was due the
partial loss on this and past musical ventures.
But he didn’t seem to want to sit down under the
affliction like Job, in the dust, and scrape himself
with a broken property plate. His late experience
hadn’t had an astringent effect on his musical
generosity, and he promised them more of Signor
Carlo Dani (let no one name his retriever “ Carlo,”
after this) in conjunction with Amy Castles.
Behind the speaker Madame Sapio was whisper-
ing translations of the speech to Dani, who had a
white rose in his coat, and the resurrection of his
little, black moustache on his lip. Signora
Benedetto, in the blue silk and pearls and fair wig
of “La Giaconda,” got gasps of translation from
Hazon. Marchi, in the wrinkles and rags of La
Cieca, opened her blinded eyes and gave wide,
child-like smiles of approval at the managerial
box, where Mrs. Williamson, in maize velvet, was
weariner the contralto’s gift—big Creole ear-rings.
Then there was more cheering, and long after the
auditorium lights were out manager and principals
could scarcely struggle through the crowds that
blooked Market-street, and made grabs at Dani’s
hands, and called out, “ Come back, Sapio ! ”
Signor Hazon has returned to his professorial
duties, one of them being that of conductor to the
Philharmonic. A girl ’harmonic was rejoicing
over his return —“Not that he’s any better than
Mr. Delaney,” she asserted; “but he swears at
us, and that makes us feel we are being kept up
to the mark. Mr. Delaney doesn’t swear, and he
doesn’t perspire and crack his ioints like the
Signor.”
Manly is recovering from a Dam joke. Upon
a night last week the Italian tenor had promised
to sing there at a concert. He forgot the terms
of his engagement to Mr. Williamson. But
Bracy remembered. American tenor Lyding,
from St. Patrick’s Cathedral, was hustled down
at a few moments notice to take the Italian’s
place, and as no announcement of the change was
made he sang as Signor Dani. Majority of per-
sons in the nail were none the wiser, and went
into heroics over his voice and “ thoroughly
Italian appearance.”
_ Imagine the exact opposite to our usual concep-
tion of a gay Parisienne, and you have Mdlle.
Lotty as known in private life. The Tivoli’s
latest attraction does not like society, does not
like late suppers ; she is not gay and dashing in
private life, and she does noc care a packet of
hairpins for dress. An American magazine
affirms that she is even negligent in her attire,
and except when she is clothed in colored light
at the theatre, she would as soon be robed in a
holland -skirt and simple blouse as anything else.
Mdlle. Lotty is not exactly pretty in face, but
she has what other women call a nice face. One
gentleman who interviewed her affirms that she
is “motherly.”
A splendid life-size portrait ot Miss Grace
Palotta in the Henry Ashby Co. show-case, in
George-street, is the cause of much obstruction
of the footpath. It is a splendid advt. for Grace’s
dressmaker and Grace’s own taste in choice of
design, fabrics, lace and accessories. These are
reproduced as to detail with microscopic accuracy.
But what held me was the wood-carving of the
street show-case—exquisite in design and work-
manship.
Xmas cards to hand from Madame Ella Russell
carry all the good luck significations, such as a
horse shoe, a bean, a pig, a slipper. Her husband’s
name is printed below hers, and cornerwise on the
card is a tiny white one bound with satin baby
ribbon and engraved “ Camillo Luis.” These are
the names of that wonderful infant who has come
to tli e singer after ten years of married life.
A great crowd at international cricket match on
Saturday. Nothing remarkable in way of dressing,
save that several women showed that they knew
“what was going to be” in the matter of millinery
—most of the trimming at the back instead of the
floral load above the eye as heretofore. Neck
Srnishings and waist ribbons fastened at the
ck, and short skirts of what looked like brown
paper were worn by a pair of English women.
A pale face gleamed over a frock of green
silk, with open front and sailor collar of
white, and over the white face a dark green
hat with green silk to match, and one solitary,
shivering plume. Two Junoesque damsels,
obviously twins, had rounded figures draped in
white silk, trained and flounced, and trimmed
with cream lace under toques of pink chiffon,
cream lace and pink roses. Down in a corner, all
aloije, watching a Beauty and a Beast, sat a dark-
featured girl, with raven tresses and a biscuit-
colored hat with two trailing white plumes
springing from a knot of red poppies. The effect
was highly artistic. Beauty wore a hat of plaited
straw, over which tumbled a wilderness of forget-
me-nots and baby-roses. Underneath it her
white costume and white shoes gave a delight-
fully feminine effect. Beauty shone by force
of contrast. For the Beast was heavy-featured,
with dark stains on his face showing where the
black whiskers had been reaped close, and big
bunches of muscle on his jaws indicated that if he
wasn’t a prize-fighter he had missed that station
of life to which Providence had intended to call
him. Beauty’s face was charming—sunburnt,
brown as a nut, with great liquid eyes. No won-
der the Beast looked happy. Let us all be Beasts!
Miss Daisy Chamier, the pianiste who went to
Tasmania on a concert tour is said by local papers
to be engaged to a Mr. Robert Gfrove.
Whilst on the engagement subject : A young
man—the real good Annie Swannish young
man, with no vices—after long search found his
true affinity (so he wrote his mother) —an Annie
Swannish girl, “lady-like,” gentle and domes-
ticated. He asked the usual question, and got the
general answer. They were within a few days of
their wedding when, one afternoon, he called to
escort her to a garden-party. She wore one of
the transparent blouses of a most modest cut. He
looked very grave, and requested her to change it
for an opaque one. She demurred, but he insisted.
So she went, smiling strangely, to her room, and
he waited. He waited till the sun set. Then a
maid told him that Rosalind had left long ago for
the garden-party. When he got there Rosalind
was cuddled-up near an officer-boy on a rustic
chair. Both laughed heartily as he approached,
and the officer-boy had the girl’s engagement-ring
on top of his thumb. The Woman-at-Home hero
has recommenced his search for a wife.
At the marriage of Lady Helen Stewart and
Lord Stavordale last month in London the
wedding presents were valued at £340,000. This
in a country where thousands of persons die yearly
of starvation, or of the deadly conditions of
labor! Fathers of bride and groom “are im-
mensely wealthy peers.” A perfectly superfluous
statement. The value of the wedding gifts indi-
cates their riches. Now what about the camel, the
needle, and the Kingdom of Heaven? The
needle’s eye is growing no larger, and the camel is
swelling every day.
If we want an antipodean antithesis for the
foregoing we have it in that “shocking dis-
covery” made at Darlinghurst last week. Two
old unmarried women, sisters, were found by the
police dying of starvation. They lay on two old
couches, barely covered with bags. One of the
sisters was partially paralysed, the other had
injured her back recently in a fall. Both had been
starving for some time, yet apparently had made
no appeal for public or private charity.
A grand concert in aid of St. Margaret’s Mater-
nity Hospital will take place at Centenary Hall,
on Tuesday, Feb. 11. Mr. Sydney Hoben, under
whose direction the concert will be given, has
secured the assistance of the new baritone, Mr.
Tower; also of Messrs. Burns-Walker, Lawrence
Campbell, Arthur Mason, and Misses Fanny
Bauer, Bertha Fanning, Mabel Ward, and other
artists.
National Gallery’s picture restorer has done a
marvellous bit of “restoring” with Mr. St. Vin-
cent Welch’s picture, “The Gamesters,” which
is now on view at the Gallery. A photograph of
the painting before its restoration shows it as
through a fog, with some of the background figures
little more than indicated. Coat upon coat of
varnish was worked off by the restorer, who was
three weeks at the task, and now the painting
is flesh and blood realism. Its deep crim-
sons, browns, orange-reds, and greens glow -out
in gloomy freshness from the 300 years-old canvas.
Michael Angelo Amerighi de Caravaggio (not
to defraud him of any of his names) was a
Milanese, and a founder of the Realistic school of
painting. Irt “ The Gamesters” a group of card-
shapers are shown rooking a 16th century Lord
Verisopht. A lady of quality, evidently a decoy,
rests a wonderful hand on his shoulder. One of
the rooks, skulking behind him, signals to a con-
federate that the “pigeon” holds the two of
spades. Critics enthuse over the aliveness of the

“ Weekly (afternoon) receptions are the special
form of entertainment that Governor Clarke’s
family affects. Croquet is being vigorously prac-
tised all over South Yarra, Malvern and Toorak,
and out-of-date people, whose croquet is rusty, are
even suspected of plugging away long after sun-
down and smiting a ball covered with luminous
paint at a hoop similarly prepared. For croquet
is to occupy the lawns of ‘ Stonington ’ on these
al fresco occasions. Croquet brings a new type of
charmer to the front. It is a strictly genteel sport
—one for curates and young ladies who knit vests.
The Sydenham Clarkes will bring a new Princess
Charming into vogue. Rather obsolete manners
will return to fashion, and the chippy Maude of
the day must come off her elevators and cease her
skirt-whiskings. If she could even drop her name
and call herself Jane or Charlotte or some staid and
bun-strugglesome term like that it would not be
amiss.
“ A close and puzzled scrutiny of all the globe-
trotting Johnnies who descend upon us per
weekly R.M.S., also of the local exquisites who
follow in the train of the Piccadilly pets, shows
that tailors are getting very saving with their
cloth. There’s not a superfluous inch in any well-
cut garment and no bulldog could get even a
snack out of them. There’s no slack to the pants
of the upper classes now. Every coat has a
skimped, pinched appearance and ‘ frocks no
longer sweep the street with their tails. Collars
are higher and starchier and .more dazzlesome
than ever, and ties are mere wisps or else little
bows made up on the wearer. The ready-made
bow stamps a man. Swallow-tails should be
called sparrow-tails now. And do you see that
His Most Gracious has ordained that knee
breeches and black silk hose are to be in style for
this coming season ? King Ed. has a good pair of
calves himself, but the ukase is rough on those of
his loyal subjects who are blessed with shanks
that look like two emaciated walking-sticks.
“Most of Melbourne’s swagger girls flaunt the
Englishmen’s colors, and bemoan the accident to
poor, dear Barnes’s knee, but it was a Geelong girl
who put up the record for enthusiasm at the
recent match on the M.C.G. ground. She was a
whaleboned belle, even her lace-collar being
hitched up by supporting beams to the lobe of her
aristocratic ear. Across her lacey vest was
stretched a long band of the Maclarenites’ colors —
like an order-sash. She was perched in the front
row under the awning, and cheered with a clap
and a bravo and leap in the air every time the
visitors bowled over one of her own countrymen.
“Mr. Yes-No Reid had a look in at the English-
men versus Country cricket match the other day,
and made a fat target for feminine eyes in the
shade of the pavilion. Finding a snooze im-
Eossible amid so much observation he moved
eavily forward like a ’bus to the men’s reserve,
but, being kept awake there also by numerous
acquaintances, he retired altogether from- the
scene, to enjoy his necessary siesta in some quieter
corner.
“The medical faculty is breaking out in unex-
pected ways and spots all over the State. The
other day one of the pill-brethren left wife,
family, and practice to take wing with a pretty
charmer from one of the Collins-st. tea-rooms.
And there are more to follow.
“Melbourne’s golden-haired pianiste, Mrs.
Fred. Jolley, is to face the music of matrimony
with Mr. Malcolm Marsh—a Melbourne bachelor —
to-day (Thursday) at St. Mary’s Church, Caulfield.
It has been mentioned before that Mr. Marsh is
noted for a small singing-voice and a high dog-
cart.
“ The hitching-up of Joey Cassilis —the slender,
flaxen-haired beauty of the Comic Opera Co. at
Her Majesty’s—with a Sydney barrister, went off
rather quietly at the ‘ Grand ’ last week.
“ One of the bachelor members of the House of
Reps, is contemplating matrimony. The lady on
whom his eye is fixed hails from Sydney, and is
sister-in-law of another Rep.—a very garrulous
Rep., too. The House looks on the marriage with
favor; it reckons that its ear will have a brief, well-
earned rest while that voluminous Rep. is away
seeing his fair relative married to the other Rep.

“Judge Hodges returned last week after a
year’s globe-trot, minus his family, which remains
abroad another year to enjoy life on the Con-
tenong. Mr. Hodges’ two daughters are fresh,
wholesome-looking girls, who are calculated to
make the continent look a brighter and better
place while their residence lasts. Judge Hood
and his family tripped off last week for the
Coronation. Mrs. Hood is one of the smartest of
our Sassiety women—a clever, quick-witted, good-
looking, dressy dame. The Maddens are also
going Coronation-wards shortly.
“ A certain toney person who figured in a
recent squabble was, before her rich husband
bestowed her on Society, a very creditable cook.
Probably her temper became heated in early life
over the pots and pans of a Mrs. Todgers’ estab-
lishment, and the habit of driving a bitter and
rebellious kitchen-range may have given her an
autocratic tendency. But her' heart is under-
stood to be situated in the right place, and those
who can remember having met with her cooking
say that she cooked like an angel.
“When your correspondent reads and listens
to the discourses of other women concerning
feminine clubs, something seems to whisper
gently in her ear, that women don’t know how to
club worth a cent. If they join together and
profess and call themselves a elub they always
yearn to be Useful or Ornamental or Intellectual,
and they forget the whisky and soda, and tobacco,
and cards,.and such-like, in a way that would make
a man snort with derision. There is a woman’s
club in London where they mend clothes and
brush hats, and make good soup which they sell
at tuppence a jug; and ‘ Rita,’ the Melb.
Herald angel, advocates with great fervor
that such should be established here. No doubt
it would be a great boon in the winter months ;
but a club should surely go in for some emblem
more convivial than the tuppeny soup-jug.
“ A few penladies are seriously—too seriously—
thinking of trying to evolve a” club out of their
number. But they are very few all told, and
most of them are a bit scratchy when in each
other’s company, so the prospects don’t look too
hopeful. _ The Austral Salon is barred by them
because it has fallen from its original lofty plane
into the hands of a merely tea-absorbing crowd.
All the same, the A.S. flourishes. It was, during
all last year, chivvied about from pillar to post by
the Board of Health, but it has now settled down
in desirable quarters in Flinders Lane, with a
staircase wide enough to admit ten cultured
ladies abreast. Lady Hopetoun, the original
guiding star of the Salon as president, has now
gone up a step as patroness, and Mrs. Gov.
larke camps on Her Ex.’s old perch. On
Monday afternoon tea-cups were drained in honor
of Mrs. Geo. Langridge, who is off to London to
help Edward VII. to put his crown on straight;
also Mrs. Fred. Jolley, on the eve of her mar-
riage. That pleasant and talented lady has
thumped the Salon piano tunefully, out of pure
friendliness and good nature, for years.
“A returned tourist who was present at Miss
Amy Castles’ debut in the Big Smoke, gives a
disappointing account of that Bendigo damsel’s
appearance. All the talk about her deportment,
figure, and style is a sorry travesty of facts. Amy
is still shy, says this tourist, and while not exactly
awkward on the platform, is not very engaging or
attractive. Her nervousness was more palpable
in her carriage and movements than in her voice,
which rang out sweetly and beautifully enough.
In a duet which finished the concert, Ada Crossley
coupled her big organ-like notes with the debuting
Amy’s, but the steady swell of the contralto’s
voice drowned the full canary cadence of the other.
Melba, the same tourist declares, is a marvel and
a mystery. On the stage she is cold, stiff, with
the brilliance of ice shining in the sun. In private
life, a big, emotional woman of warming en-
thusiasm.
“ Speaking of the Australian girl’s figure, this
same globe-trotter notes a point or two. The
appearance of our flat-backed figures after a
review of the curves—-the generous curves—of the
American girl is almost laughable in the traveller’s
eyes. Here, it is held, our girls are still develop-
ing abrupt busts, whereas the rest of the feminine
world have literally let theirs collapse. On the
other hand, all about the region of the hips they
have cultivated an ‘ improved outline ’ that there’s
no overlooking. The walk, too, of the Boston,
New York, and now the Paris fashionables, is
designed to give the hips free action of a develop-
ing kind. The small, mincing steps of the English
miss, and the long-legged strut of the Australian,
are not in it with the firm, hip-exercising move-
ments of the Yankee maid.
“The suicide of Charles Tilbury—the first
Mephisto of Musgrove’s Grand Opera co. —is just
now causing tongues to wag as to the sudden and
uncertain ends of all those who play the Satanic
rdle in ‘Faust.’ But poor basso Tilbury had an
unfortunate failing that caused many Melbourne
people who met him in private to apprehend some
mental weakness.
“The new members of Musgrove’s 1 Sweet Nell
of Old Drury’ co. disported themselves in the
circle of the Princess’s last Wednesday night. All
on view were youthful and dressy. One tall,
thin charmer, with the narrow Egyptian eyes
beloved of the divine Sarah’s worshippers, ap-
peared first with a large, indefinite hat atop her
chestnut crown. After consultation with manager
Musgrove, she slipped off to the un-dressing room
to remove it, and returned to her seat, munching
sweets from a paper bag. If Musgrove simply
bade her take off the hat, and she took it off, then
it would seem that he has his co. well under con-
trol.
“ Letters from the Titheradge family in London
state that ‘ G.S.’ and all his bairns are flourishing.
He has plenty of engagements, with good salary
attached to them. Lily, his eldest girl, is married
and on her way out to Sydney with her bride-
groom. The other girls are clerking, typing,
millinering, each on her own, and doing anything
but mumming. Lily was the only one to follow
Dad’s example, and she didn’t stick to the boards
long. Tith’s only trouble in his suburban home is
the size of his garden, and his heart is still with
his daffodils way down in Ascot Yale.
“Pleasenote that actors’ daughters are breaking
away nowadays from the tradition that stage
talent is hereditary. So many clever girls with
theatrical connections are earning their more or
less humble crust in other fields of energy. The
Titheradge girls are about 12 instances ; also the
two daughters of F. 0. Appleton have joined
forces with two of Dr. Neild’s girls in a smart
dressmaking biz. in Brunswick-st., Melbourne,
and so far are doing very well, thank you.
Yours affectionately,
AEENEHL.

Touring through Europe one is thrilled by
the many lovely women of the different nationali-
ties. French, German, Spanish women, all have
their special and delightful charm of face and
form. But the Australienne has the special
charm of combining in her sweet face and fair
form many of the best qualities of all the races.
It needs only the P.D. Corset —beloved of all

Despite the efforts of the Jingo press to
hide the fact, the Federal Government was
badly hit over allowing the S.A. soldiery
to attend a political meeting in Adelaide.
Blustering Forrest vainly tried to set things right
by heaving his much-worn charge of “seeking
notoriety ” against Labor-leader Watson. The
S.A. Premier and the Mayor of Adelaide, for
their own political purposes, asked Forrest to
permit the troops to be paraded at what was
called a patriotic meeting—most frauds, in these
days, go about with a patriotic title placarded all
over them. Forrest took the request to the
Cabinet, and permission was given to parade the
Adelaide forces. Rightly, the Labor party—the
only people in Australia who, so far, know what
it is to have the military rifles at their breasts —
resented this deliberate stab at the liberty of free
speech. The members of that party were sup-
ported in unexpected places, and Barton and
Bigjohn Forrest were pleased when the debate on
the question terminated with Watson’s nasty
remark that “he was convinced the Govt, now
knew the feeling of members.” Ministers were
especially uncomfortable during little Hughes’s
short speech. He twitted them with having gone
further in support of Chamberlain’s policy, in
Adelaide, than Chamberlain dared go for himself
in England.

A Bulletin contributor alleges that a
cousin of N.S.W. State Governor Rawson was, 30
years ago, a reader on Sydney Evening News.
He was a clever fellow, in delicate health, and
inclined to Bohemianism. Curious how almost
every celebrity appears to have a cousin in
Australia.
The death of Charles Dickens’ son in
western N.S.W. recalls that the son of another

more a man of affairs than Dickens, junior,
and does good service as chairman of the Went-

Mr. Chamberlain, who now sees a hope

The career of Nansen, elected to lead the
Oppositionin W. A., has been marked byquiek pro-
gress from the ranks. First elected April, 1901;
Minister, Nov., 1901; leader of Opposition and
prospective Premier, Jan., 1902. All in nine
months ! Nansen is on the editorial staff of the
grandmotherly West Australian, and helps to
keep that old journalistic lady’s cap and spectacles
straight.
The will of one Charles Butler, lately
proved in Melb., bequeaths £lOO to a Wesleyan
church, and a further £6 a year for three years to
pay the rent of a pew for widow Butler and
family. As an incentive to attendance at Divine

advance is an essentially Wesleyan device. Not
to be good would, under the circumstances, be an
awful waste of money.

camps at Ballarat during the insurrection. After-
wards went to Queenscliff, became one of the first
councillors, and had the misfortune to be Mayor
for one year.
Alleged relic of Ben Hall: A man on
Piercefield Estate (N.S.W.), the other week, dis-
covered an old gun in a hollow log. On the stock
was carved, “B. Hall, bushranger;” and it is
supposed to have been hidden there some 60 years
ago. Still, it seems unusual for a bushranger to
put his occupation on his gun or his visiting-card
after this fashion.
Out in the West (N.S.W.) they all knew

Significantly it was an Afghan camel-man that

The Commercial Agency appointments
made by the See Government are about the

WhenGov.-GeneralHopetoun was “doing”
the mines at the Boulder (W.A.), he was taken to
one remarkable for its rich specimens. The
manager, addressing him as General, said, “Now!
here you are,” handing him an extra good piece of
stone. “ Thank you very much,” said - Hopetoun,
thinking it a present. “Good Lord! you can’t
take that, General,” cried the manager; and the
Governor apologised.
An English paper dubs “Banjo” Paterson
the poet Laureate of Australia. Which reminds
the writer that on one occasion a correspondent
wrote Melb. Age asking the names of the three
greatest English poets. The editor left it to the
staff. The staff thought it was a joke and
decided on Shakspeare, Byron and one Jenkins of
Geelong. Jenkins made equally awful verses on
all subjects. He even wrote his will in rhyme.
N.S.W. is to have a naval officer as Gover-

already provided with military men. Evidently
this continent is to be regularly exploited to re-
cruit the fighting castes of Great Britain.

and a vice-admiral —not a baronet and an admiral
of the fleet, or even a complete plain admiral, as
some have vainly imagined.
The new Edward VII. sovereigns are

Highly popular item going the rounds of

The Daily News states that a recent visitor to ex-
President Kruger found him in a condition of senile

cular craze was cricket. He did not walk miles
to church the day before his death, but he would
always walk a long distance to see a match, and
when asked how he felt by a Melb. bowler a few
months back, he said, “ Oh, I’m only just set.”
The late Parnell on Chamberlain —speech
delivered in the House of Commons :
My principal recollection of the right hon. gentleman,
the member for West Birmingham, before he became a
Minister, is that he was always most anxious to put me
forward, and my friends forward, to do work which he
was afraid to do himself. And after he became a Minister,
my principal recollection of him is that he was always
most anxious to betray to us the secrets and counsels of
his colleagues in the Cabinet, and to endeavor, while
sitting beside those colleagues, and while in consultation
with them, to undermine their councils and their plans.
A minor tragedy from Sydney Telegraph’s
personal column :
Amongst the passengers by the Sonoma on Tuesday
was Mr. VV. P. Crick, State Minister for Lands. Mr.
Crick intends remaining in Maoriland for a few weeks to
recuperate, as his health lately has occasioned his friends
some uneasiness. He was accompanied by Mr. D. Green,
and a party of Parliamentarians were on the steamer to
bid him bon voyage, amongst them being Mr. A. Kelly,
Mr. D. O’Connor, and Mr. R. D. Meagher.—( January SO.)

was not present on board R.M.S. Sonoma on Tuesday
when Mr. < rick, the Minister for Lands, left for Maori-
land.— {February 1.)
Henry Furniss, the ex-London Punch
artist, the humorless bald-pup-looking person,
who was so dreadful a frost. as a lecturer in
Australia, thus writes in his “ Confessions of a
Caricaturist ”:
This bit of a place here, with a population less than
that of a second-class provincial town in England, has in
it people with more cheek than would be found in the
capitals of London, Paris, and St. Petersburg rolled into
one. Why, these people have some ingrained vain idea
that everything and everybody connected with them are
the most important things and the most important people
in the world. Small-minded people in a large country—
that is what they are—a country the size of Europe, with
a population less than that of London, with the intellect
of a country village. That is Australia.
A young Queens-
lander, who recently re-
turned from South
Africa, relates that he
was told off as orderly to
a colonel on the staff,
and the first day out)
they were under heavy
fire. They dismounted,
while the officerexam-
ined the position through
his glasses, but soon
things got so warm that
they had to take to their
horses again. The Bana-
nalander threw the
colonel’s bridle over the
neck of the horse in the
usual bush fashion and
didn’t bother about hold-
ing the stirrup. ‘ ‘ Damn
you, sir,” exclaimed the
officer, “ don’t you know
how to hold a horse?”
“No, sir,” was the
prompt reply, “ I’ve
never been a damned
groom before!” For a
moment the colonel
glared, but he said no-
thing until they were out
of fire. Then he pro-
duced his cigar-case
with: “Have a weed, youngster?” “After
that,” said the Queenslander, “he was as good
as a father to me.”
Dr. Visser, surgeon of Johannesburg hos-
pital, has been sentenced to two years hard labor
because he is supposed to have been aware that
his countryman, Brocksma, was in correspondence
with the Boer leaders, and he didn’t turn informer.
Considering the scorn and loathing which the
British attach to the term “informer ” it is better
to do the two years. So long as Britain tolerates
Boucicault’s dramas, in which the informer is
always held up to contempt as the lowest worm on
earth, it shouldn’t expect anybody to fill that
bill.
In the Jamaica rebellion of ’65, over which
ex-Governor Eyre (one time of Australia and
Maoriland, and lately deceased) got into so much
trouble, the negroes killed 25 persons and wounded
35, five houses being burnt, and about 20 stores
and houses wholly or partially sacked. Under
the Governor’s retaliatory measures, 354 persons
were executed by sentence of courts-martial, 50
were hanged or shot without trial, 25 were shot by
Maroons who aided the Govt., and 10 were other-
wise killed. In all, 439 were put to death and 600
others were flogged. One commission appointed
to investigate reported that the punishments were
excessive and sometimes barbarous, and that the
burning of 1000 houses by Eyre’s orders was
wanton and cruel. When Protector of Aborigines
in S.A., in ’35, Eyre was a staunch champion of
theirights of the natives.
WHAT DREAMS MAY COME.

Consider the marvellous luck of Roberts,
as compared with the ill-luck of other British
commanders in South Africa: Buller, with about
25,000 or 30,000 men, was pitted against the best
Boer general and the biggest Boer army, in a
mountainous country, and had a bad time.
Methuen was sent against Cronje in comparatively
easy country, but Methuen had so very small a
force that he couldn’t surround his enemy and he
couldn’t make wide flank movements. Then
Roberts was sent out with such an overwhelming
force that he could hardly avoid surrounding
FLAT.
JOHN DOWNER: The hon. member didn’t say it was unjust. The Boers
were guilty of the first act of aggression.
JOSIAH SYMON: They invaded Natal. (Hear, hear.)
JOHN DOWER: Of course they did.
CITZEN : “ Haven't you got him sufficiently flattened out yet?
B ULL: “ He hit me first !”
Cronje—he could attack Cronje with twice his
force in front, and yet have three or four times
Cronje’s whole army to send round in his
rear. Roberts, with his immense army, selected
as his antagonist the inferior Boer general with
the small force and the weak position, and
left Buller still hammering with a small force
at the biggest and most dangerous enemy.
He hemmed Cronje in with nearly tenfold
numbers, and even then a large proportion of
the Dutch general’s force got through Roberts’
cordon and escaped. De la Rey, who attempted to
relieve Cronje with a mere handful of men, was
allowed to put his head right into the British
lion’s mouth —and take it out again uninjured.
And when Roberts had taken Bloemfontein, made
it his headquarters, and had the great bulk of his
army close around it, the same De la Rey attacked
a British force within about a dozen miles of
him, fought it for the best part of a day, and
then took all that remained of it prisoners, and
got away without any aid coming to the Britishers
from their Commander-in-Chief who was sleeping
almost next door. Last of all Roberts went home
thinking the war was over. Many a commander
would have been ruined by the things Roberts did
in South Africa, yet Roberts’s military repute
was actually enhanced by them. French, the
man who did wonders with only a fraction of
Roberts’ resources, who was never surprised, and
who allowed no De la Rey to tread on his tail
with impunity, put up a record worth a dozen of
that of the over-rated Commander-in-Chief.
When the late Mr. Gough (a giant of 15ft.
sin., as good as he was big) was
P.M. on the Herbert River. Q., lie
had frequently before him an old
nuisance called Goatts, who was
always a plaintiff or defendant. At
last Gough could stand him no
longer, and one day, in dismissing
an information the nuisance had
laid against someone, addressed
him thus: “Mr. Goatts, if you
ever come before me again, either
as a complainant or defendant, as
a witness, or even as a spectator in
this court, I’ll give you three
months. If I ever see you in the
street or anywhere else I’ll give you
three months. If I see your name
written or printed anywhere I’ll give you three
months. If I hear you mentioned by anybody
I’ll give you three months, and I’ve a good
mind to give you three months in any case.”
And thereafter there was peace on the
Herbert River.
A wrinkled Maori warrim lately
walked up to the court where old age pen-
sion applications were being heard, care-
lessly concealed his new and expensive tan
boots under a tree, and then went in and
applied. He said he didn’t possess “hike-
pen ” and was barefooted through extreme
poverty. It promptly transpired, however,
that the guileless brownie was worth £4OO,
and that his wife had property valued
at £3OOO. Then a rejected brown appli-
cant went out cursing to put on his tan
boots, and when he found they had
been stolen while he was in applying
he cursed something extra so very
extra, in fact, that the policeman
made for him, and our unshod fellow-
subject had to run for it.

The innumerable visitors who have stayed at “ The

but praise for this famous Hotel. Ladies with
families obtain every comfort and attention at
a very reasonable cost. The rooms, furniture and
appointments of “The Australia” are unsurpass-
able. The Hotel has been built with every attention
to the needs of the climate. Hence, on the hottest
Summer day, the coolness of its rooms is as refresh-
ing as a cold bath.

The beer drinkers of Rokewood (Vic.)
went on strike, the other day, standing out against
the infamous charge of 6d. for a long, slim beer.
The strike had been on for about three days at
time of writing, and was still making good
progress. The pickets surrounding the pubs laid
for every man who was seen bearing down on a
bar with the aspect of one whose intense ingrow-
ing thirst had overcome his noble aspirations, and
urged him to take a drink at the creek and hold
out. As a rule he held out. Present inebriate
remembers another such strike on a Vic. mining
field, when the strikers held out valiantly until the
publicans were on the point of ruin. Then the
fact that the strikers continued to get drunk once
a week as usual was investigated, and resulted in
the strike-leaders being arrested for selling fer-
mented liquor without a license. The agitators had
stocked a stable with mighty barrels of beer, and
were driving a lucrative trade retailing it to the
strikers at 4d. a pannikin. Writer was
too, when a strike was organised in a navvies’
camp on the St. Arnaud line agairist the un-
licensed shanty-keeper. About this time the
police raided the shanty, and then the
noble, forgiving character of the navvies asserted
itself. They refused to leave even an enemy in
the lurch, and when the police were seen coming
they toiled like fiends at carrying out and con-
cealing the stock. And they concealed it so well
that the shanty gentleman never saw a drop of it
again.

“ F.H.8.” : In reply to query re rabbits
losing their ears through phosphorus-poison-
ing (8., 25/l/’O2). Was laying phosphorised
pollard last year on a station near Euston, and
often noticed rabbits with lop-ears (like the tame
species). Rabbit, when phosphorus - poisoned,
seems to lose power to erect ears again, but if it
recovers from effects of poison, ears drop off close
to the skull. Know nothing about ’possums
chewing one another’s ears off, but have seen pup
chew off the ears of a pet lamb with whom he was
the best of chums. The event caused no animosity
on the part of either animal.

A reminiscence from Broken Hill :
The Army usually held its open-air meetings outside
one of our local hotels. The hotelkeeper’s wife wag
seriously ill, and was not expected to last through the
night. The Army was informed of the fact and requested
to remove its outcries to a reasonable distance, which
it did, after cautiously ascertaining that the case was
really serious. Some little time later, the publican was
waited on by a Salvationist, who said that in consequence
of being removed the collection had fallen 13s. 4d.
short of the usual amount, and he requested the landlord
to make up the deficit. Meanwhile, the patient had died.
It isn’t every man who finds himself bailed up a few
minutes after his wife’s death by a pious and unselfish
sect demanding 13s. 4d.
“C. H.G.” : Re the bell-bird. Your cor-
respondent, writing from Bunyip, South Gipps-
land, says it is like a ininah. It is not to be con-
fused with the bell-bird of Gippsland, which is
correctly termed the bell-minah, being classed as
a honey-eater, with the native ininah. It stays in
the same district both summer and winter, and in
October rears its first brood. Its actions are
lively, a number of hops; and, if disturbed when
feeding, it flies into the nearest tree. Bell-minahs
are numerous in wooded, dry places ; but are
seldom seen in the mountains.

A child aged years wandered away from
Golden Gate, Croydon, on 11th Jan. Four days
later, after hundreds of residents had searched the
bush, and though rain had fallen in the meantime,
a blackfellow named Larry picked up the tracks
and followed them for 35 miles. Eventually he
came to a spot where, he said, the child had fallen
down to die. The body had been carried away by
a dingo for its pups—a portion was found some
distance away. Larry is a N.S.W. black, and is
over 60 years of age.

Published, as a matter of news without

One of these was a previous escapee. He had a hand-

visible, while his fingers were rotting off.
Now it isn’t alleged that the handcuff became so
tight through the excessive fattening of the nigger.
Apparently it was put on that way. And this is

many years. Razorback is not the home of small,
bushy timber, but of forest giants.

The recent earthquakes at Cheviot (M.L.)
recall how, many years ago, the city of Wellington
shook for weeks. Residents took to tents, and
two ship-loads of panic-stricken people fled
from the port, only to be wrecked in the
Straits off Island Bay. No lives were
lost, but all the passengers’ effects went
down, and the people returned to their
tents wetter and wiser. A swamp,
which had been ; set aside as
a dock reserve, was raised
three feet, and is now Wel-
lington’s cricket ground. It
is still known as the Basin
Reserve. And outside of
what is now the Albert
Hotel a boiling mud-
hole broke out. Though
this mud-hole is extinct
now, the footpath in its
vicinity is constantly
sinking. In fact, the
whole of Wellington,
which, without doubt, is
built over a geological
“fault,” sinks a fraction
of an inch annually. And
.no one krows for certa’n
whether it will maintain
this steady pace till it
leaves off sinking altogether,
or whether it will one day do
a memorable slide and settle
down in a heap. Living in Wel-
lington is an interesting gamble
of a mild kind—somewhat as if
Methuselah and his compatriots
had belonged to a Suicide Club
which held a ballot once a century to
decide on the next victim.
“D.H.R.”I “Deeby”
is quite right when he says
(8., 4/l/’O2) that most Pub-
lic School tanks are in a
horribly dirty state at the
phttom. On reading his
letter went and looked into a Public School tank.
Found paper, rags, bits of horsehair, bricks and
dirt, one dead animal, and an old copybook.
Went to one school for eight years, and during
that time the tanks were never cleaned once.

Re “Western’s” instance of a
cat chumming up with a sheep. Highborn, the
well-known racehorse, would go crazy if separated
from his favorite cat, who always slept in his
loose-box. Quite a feature of Highborn’s periodi-
cal trips to Melbourne was the lined travelling
basket containing his feline “ cobber.” I know of
another instance in which a stray lamb chummed
up with a mob of colts, running around their heels
with impunity. It was very funny when they
were racing, skylarking around the paddocks, to
see the small jumbuck trying to foot it with them.

Sox : Knew an old fellow out back living
in an absolute state of aboriginality. Had plenty
money himself, and had a family in town all doing
well. He hadn’t seen any of his family for years,
and they did not know the state the old man
had drifted to. At last one of them came up,
captured the old fellow, and took him to Mel-
bourne. He was back a fortnight later, living his
old life of rugged simplicity, and when asked why
he didn’t stay in town, he explained that “they
made him wear a starched shirt, and clean his
boots.”
THE BOYD FIRE ESCAPE
IN FULL BLAST. Note the
escapee inside, half-way down.
“ GL A. P.”
tells about the
briny deep:
Recently travel-
led per steerage
down the coast,
and registered a
mental vow to
•walk next time if
unable to raise
train fare. Accom-
modation ex-
tremely filthy.
For about 70 pas-
sengers and crew
(sailors and
stokers) one de-
cayed Bx 4 lava-
tory, thoughtfully
placed alongside
the entrance to
the cabin and
pantry, was pro-
vided, containing
a diseased-looking
towel, two foul
wash basins and
an uncanny ar-
rangement with
broken pipes
which leaked hor-
ribly. Deck space
taken up by fruit
cargo and one
horse. Horse was
close up to fruit
cargo and breath-
ed on it all the
way. Sleeping ac-
commodation foul
and close and
devoid of proper
ventilation. (I f
the air-space was
in accordance with
the Shipping Act,
then that Act
badly requires
amendment.)
Food badly cooked
and tasteless, con-
sisting generally
of greasy hot
water-they called
it soup—pump-
kins and steamed
beef culled from
ancient team bullocks. One large and oily person of the
tobacco-stained persuasion was working his passage, and
condescended to feed with us. He cleaned winches and
brass-work, and he never washed after it. I think bo
must have been hired by the co. to dissuade us from over-
eating. Anyhow, when he clawed the loaf with his la;ge,
oily hand, and cut it with the knife that had been
lingering in his mouth, he grew very unpopular. If he,
and the horse that breathed on the fruit, and the
lavatory, and the soup, were all tied together and thrown
overboard, the world would be the cleaner for their
absence.
“Bob K.” : Mention of new-chum felling
trees into cart (B. 11/l/’O2) reminds me : A couple
of new-hand tank-sinkers—Australians, too—on
the Rock Station (N.S.W.), once conceived the bril-
liant idea of undermining the “ face ” of the tank,
backing the cart underneath, and then cutting
away from above. Result—About three tons of
earth down, a wrecked cart, a damaged horse, and
14 years growth scared out of two men—seven
years each.

“ A.P.R.” : The great rabbit trek has
reached Coonamble (N. S. W.), and the new Act,
which practically compels the erection of wire-
netting, will ruin scores of settlers ; but bunny
would have done that in any case. Coonamble
houses are mostly raised from the ground, and
under these thousands of rabbits have taken
lodgings, whence they emerge at early dawn and
feed on the townsfolk’s vegetables. Sporting men
now do their shooting in their own back gardens
before breakfast. A local church member caused
some havoc among them with a pea-rifle, but the
wounded rabbits, with malice intent, went and
died under the church, and the flooring had to be
taken up. Odors in church are apt to cause a
slump in the collection.

Much of the mallee on Yorke’s Peninsula
(S.A.) was originally cleared and grubbed before
the “ stump-jumper ” came into use there. Cost
70s. per acre. But wheat was ss. a bushel—which
accounted for that and lots of other things.
A weird drought item from the Northern
Territory is that about the disappearance of a
mail-coach with its occupants and ten horses. It
started out on a long and terrible dry stage, and
never turned up at the other end. The policeman
rode 77 miles of the stage in search of it; a
casual thunderstorm supplied him with a
little water and enabled him to crawl further
out than would have been otherwise possible.
He had to come back, and reported nothing in
front but plain hell, with Gehenna on one side
and Sheol on the other. There is something
quaint and grim about the idea of a dead coach
bleaching in the wilderness, with its dead horses
and its dead passengers, and the undeveloped
resources of this great country stretching all
around it, and rotting in the mail-bag the never-
to-be-delivered letter asking “ Tattersall ” to send
along a five-shilling ticket in his sweep on the
Shattered Cup.

When Moran was police magistrate at
Hughenden (Q.) a case came before him in the
Small Debts Court in which a modiste sued a bar-
maid for the making uf a dress. The defendant
alleged that the article did not fit and that the
stuff was spoiled. On the morning of the hearing
Moran saw a good-looking young woman standing
in the courthouse verandah with a large brown
paper parcel under her arm, and courteously
offered her a seat in his office. This she accepted,
depositing her parcel on the floor. When the
case was on and the defendant was in the box, the
solicitor on the other side asked her if she had the
dress in court. She said she had not, whereupon
she was asked where it was. Then followed an
embarrassing silence, during which the pretty
defendant looked inquiringly at the P.M. “I
must insist upon my question being answered,
your worship,” said the lawyer. “You must
answer,” said the beak, and then came in a con-
fidential whisper to the Bench : “I left it in your
room.” The solicitor discreetly went on to
another question, while a faint blush pervaded
the court, and people endeavoured to look at His
Washup with a shocked expression. As for
Moran—well, there was a bright-red and very
angry P.M. on the bench.

men with lion hearts and muscles of india-rubber.”—
Bulletin recently.
We want them lion-hearted
These men upon the land,
Where water must be carted
Through miles of mallee sand.
Yes, hearts as hard as metal,
As little power to feel!
In best of health and fettle,
With muscles strong as steel.
When want of rain is burning
The Western fields of wheat,
And price is downward turning,
They must not know defeat.
They must be never beaten ;
Their motto, “ Never fail,”
When oaten crops and wheaten
Are battered down by hail.
When barley’s full of sorrel
As a choir is full of sin,
With Fate they mustn’t quarrel
As they cart the rubbish in.
When blighting “ rust ” comes after
A year of over-wet,
They must not strain a rafter—
Just curse it, and forget.
For when they’ve paid the rent,
And expenses, and the men,
The cheque is mostly spent,
So they just begin again.

An “Amy Castles” Tenor.
DISABLED THROUGH CRICKETING.
It is to be hoped that few vocalists meet with the
misfortune which actually overtook Mr. William
Neilson, a leading tenor, late of Miss Amy
Castles’ concert co., and of Williamson and Mus-
grove’s Royal Comic Opera Co. “My misfor-
tune occurred whilst we were on tour with Miss
Amy Castles in New Zealand, ” said Mr. Neilson,
when explaining. “In Dunedin we played
cricket in the drizzling rain, and I thoroughly
enjoyed the game, thinking nothing of it until
some time afterwards, when I found my joints
and muscles becoming swollen and stiff. Before
long they ached terribly, and I could scarcely use
my limbs, being confined to bed for some time.
I was told I had a sharp attack of rheumatism,
and indeed the pain was so bad that I could not
sleep either day or night. My appetite failed and
my general health suffered. Several remedies
I tried proved powerless, but on the advice of
a friend I began taking Dr. Williams’ pink pills
for pale people. Before long the pains lessened,
and the swelling and stiffness abated. I gradually
improved as I continued to take these pills, and
before long was quite cured. Since then I have
been in robust health, and have no doubt my
recovery is permanent.”
Cold and exposure generally start the pain of
rheumatism, which, however, is induced by im-
poverished, vitiated blood. Dr. Williams’ pink
pills make the blood rich and red and tone up the
nerves. Thus they cure all nerve and blood dis-
orders, such as anaemia, debility, neuralgia, St.
Vitus’ dance, consumption, rickets, ladies’ ail-
ments, etc. Sold by chemists and storekeepers

“ Bullfrog H tells of a new Australian
drug-habit :
Strychnine-eating is on the increase in the Darling and
Barrier country amongst the rabbit-poisoners. The drug
seems to be a splendid stimulant and tonic, but you have
to always carry it with you (.finely ground), as the craving
comes on every three or four hours. The habit begins
through tasting the paste used for the rabbits. The eyes
get very weak after a month or two of the habit, but that
and a few muscular twitches appear to be the only evil
effects so far. Of course, you have to be careful about
the brand of the stuff you are taking ; some of it
is mixed with an acid so as to dissolve easily. Will some
of your medical readers say what the general effects
would be after a year or two of the habit, or what about
a sudden stop ?
[Strychnine is certainly sometimes a “splendid
stimulant, ” to a sick man ; but beef steak is a
better for a healthy one. Eating the drug would
probably not be long persisted in, as its use would
cause painful muscular twitching, heart palpita-
tion, insomnia and, finally, death. There are no
known instances of the system becoming tolerant
of it, as of opium and morphia. It would have
no effect on the eyes ; eye soreness would be due
to the existence of arsenic or some other im-
purity. The effect of a sudden stop would be that
the natient would be cured of a silly habit; there
would be no ill-effect.—Ed. B.]
The “ Boyd Fire-Escape,” shown in full
blast, on Page 14, is a neat contrivance which takes
advantage of the fact that the most rapid way to
leave a burning building is to fall out of the
window. The escape consists of a canvas cylinder,
some six feet in circumference, constructed in a
series of angles, like the letter Z running into
eternity. When the fire comes roaring up the
staircase all the escapee has to do is to sling his
“Boyd” through the window, after carefully
making it fast to something substantial, and then
fall down through it to safety. He goes in feet
first, shoots down to the first angle, stops lialf-a-
second, slides into the next angle, and is let down
by a succession of short slides, which prevent him
getting on sufficient speed and force to injure
himself when he lands on his feet on mother
earth. Last week fifty persons descended in
perfect safety from the top of the Exchange
Buildings, in Pitt-street, Sydney, a distance
of sixty odd feet. While the escape is
being made the fire brigade can turn its
water-power on to the windows below the
escapee if there is any flame streaming from them,
and as those who wish it can be supplied with
fire-proof escapes, the presence of a little flame
would make no appreciable difference. A wooden
ladder might catch fire, and an iron one become
too hot, and the average person is liable to fall off
any sort of ladder in the excitement of a fire.
The beauty of the Boyd escape is that the ten-
dency of the excited and shivering elderly person,
or the agile young person who suffers from a weak
heart, to fall down, is utilised, and actually
becomes the means of securing his safety. The
apparatus is placed on the market by a syndicate
of Auckland (M.L ) men, and the local agents are
Messrs. Dowling and Taylor, solicitors, 113 Pitt-
street, Sydney, at whose offices a working model
of the contrivance may be seen. <

A.F.: Interesting, but tlie situation is rather
too “steep” for print T.G.F. : Been already narrated
in Bulletin E.L.D. : Well done, but too like an episode
in De Maupassant Bulger: Well, you don’t “ get the
bulge” on us Jan. S. :No time to waste over such an
absolutely futile discussion Moses: You are in the
same case as the other Moses when the candle went
out Jarran : Appropriately tough G.R.H. :
Rather large, crude horror, balanced on insufficient
motive P.F.R.: Will probably use “Waratahs”
Percy L.: “Aurora” and two other persons firmly re-
jected.. ..0.N.: “Bull-Ants” is a good and refreshing
yarn Vic. : Pretty, with a rather too vague kind of
prettiness J. King (Yic): Yes, it was the appear-
ance of the Staats Artillerie when Jamieson’s force
was already half-demoralised by hunger and bad liquor
that caused the surrender. The Artillerie (about
two dozen guns, half obsolete) was the only per-
manent force in the Transvaal then A.F. :
“Emergency” rather dull. And, by the way, how
was that remarkable horse supposed to do it from King’s
to Harrietville in one day without going out of a walk ?
.. Smilax: Good raw material for a yarn, but wants
cooking Limestone: Too much made of such a trifle.
P.F.R. : Will print “Truest Lover.” Mulga Jack:
Very good in its way, but would require a lot of re-
moulding Martha : Too reminiscent of Arthur Sketch-
ley’s “Mrs. Brown.” Will J. : Sorry none quite up.
Some of the verse is mere sound without sense
Miranda : Short, shrill shriek MacT.: No use for wail
over the “ decadence of reverence.” S.M.D. : Brightly
treated, but the theme is ancient Snod : Feeble and
self-contradictory D.D.N.: The reference is probably
to Gifford’s lines—
But let the generous actor still forbear
To copy features with a mimic’s care.
’Tis a poor skill which any fool can reach—
A vile stage custom, “ honored in the breach.”
Andy B. : You make the common mistake of assuming
that failure to prove the affirmative proves the negative
... Dutohy : Too long and dreary and didactic. The
Bulletin lias no love for State churches, but neither is it
a Nonconformist pulpit Warrigal: No humor in mere
deliberate indecency. Put some clothes on your mind...
..Glim: Had to dowse you Rooinek : Due to the
manner in which baritone parts have been gradually
forced “ up.” Within writer’s recollection a baritone was
expected to take F-below. Now he has rarely to negotiate
anything below A, but is expected, on the other hand, to
tak ; the high G. Santley’s range (exceptional) was from
Eup to A-flat—two octaves and two tones.... Bunkum :
You disarm criticism by kindly putting a label on your
own stuff Molly Bawn : You’ve been sitting too
much at the lyric feet of Tommy Moore, and you haven’t
Tommy’s redeeming accuracy of rhyme and metre
Jehan : Rather too gorgeous, as, for instance, “ Her face
was Psyche’s, white as milk, and burning to pomegranate
on either cheek, with great, brown, velvety eyes, fringed
with long, sweeping, golden-tinted lashes, under arched
brows darkly and beautifully pencilled, and her mouth —
ah, it was as though the very gods themselves had kissed
it into birth.” Why make us dissatisfied with our best
girl by such vain imaginings Pelf-die : The point is,
like Euclid’s, invisible A.V.S.H. : Altogether out of
date, now Lola (Hokitika) : Will print “ Three Little
Children.” E.C.: Will print “On the Brink.”
J.M. : Neither set of verses up to previous sample
Jack Stack : Old Bulletin Joke Ajax : Just an every-
day fact Neilmak : Much too long for the interest
R.G.M.: Not up to the mark Kola : Not a strong sort
of nut Selim : It’s because juries don’t appreciate
their own status as specifically representing the public,
whose servant the judge is, just as much as is the hum-
blest court-usher. And a jury is no more bound to sub-
mit to a wigging from the former than from the latter
H.J. : Translation of “The Merchant of Venice,” into
push dialect, regretfully declined, in view of the exist-
ence of a savage Shakespearian society in Sydney
C.S.A.: Every man picked up in the street insensible,
whether apparently from drink or any other cause,
should be conveyed to the hospital and kept there until
absolutely conscious and coherent, and not to the lock-
up. Unconscious people need the attention of doctors,
not of policemen.. ..J.G. : Yarn about sick Scotchman
being: provided by his wife with “ The Horrors of Hell as
a cheerful and amusing book fails.... Wal: Your pars, have
one good point: they are bound together with a pm....
Jjan D. : Its daring originality takes away our breath ,
instance— .
For some are happy, some are glad,
Some are sick, some are sad ;
Some by luxury are fed ;
Some are wanting daily bread.
Now we know : You are the man who writes the panto-
mime books... .R.R. : Quite agree; in fact we ve said
e > before ourselves... . K.G. : Willing to answer questions
about the principles of law, but not as to small points
of practice. A solicitor could give you the lnforma-
I. on or you could worry it out of the Probate Office
o ticials .. .Chib : Poem in 104 lines describing how the
ghost of King Alfred saw Wilson Barrett play the Chris-
tian King” held over pending inquiry as to truth of
statements C.H. : Yes, Dick Seddon, on his recent
threats, would make a good coercion sec. for Ireland....
I'.F.R. : Not up M.J.M. : Returned Ahau : Will
me “ One by One.” “ Spring-time” has been planted m
hopes it may spring some more. Certainly it couldn t
spring much less.... Rita S. \ u Cupid ” rather weak....
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
O.J.M.S. : Will use suggestion J.P.: Drawing bad
and underclothing joke shocking.... Bullock : Pointless
as a football 0. H. Walsh: Unacceptable; anyhow,
the ’roo had heaps of luck W. : Cricket drawings
unavailable... .J.W.S. ; Jap and germ idea falls flat....
J. J.D. : Excellent photo., but Bulletin not interested in
it A.J H. : Plague drawing an ambitious and meri-
torious effort, but all the subjects lack snap and
rovelty C. W. Kent Send us good Australian
i leas (social, political or other) for illustration, accom-
panied or not by rough sketches. We are always ready
t) buy them, anyhow... G. Powers: Ped. item lacks
li'imor and interest. Vide memo, posted... .S.W.P. :
Joke right off the Australian track, and probably
b irrowed. Who wears kilts in this country? Ben S. :
Poor drawing, impossible legend W.W.S. : Subject
a lintless, but your drawing shows promise A.G.G. :
No thanks. ...W. Tindale : Not up.. ..C.M.A. : Don t
s.Mid unless you have either a good original drawing or a
g >od original idea, or both. One clever new notion on a
subject of all-Australian interest is worth more to us than
a ton of sketches and gags representing two people
throwing off chestnuts.


THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH.
SHOWMAN CHAMBERLAIN (to Crowned Heads of Europe, &c.): “THIS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IS THE CELEBRATED FIGHTING DONKEYROO. HIS STRONG POINT IS MORAL EFFECT. I HAVE HIM UNDER COMPLETE

TENTS IN THE GROUNDS.
The oomraittoe has evidently asked the
Board of Health for the loan of tents, two
of which arrived, at the hospital noon after
the committee meeting closed. These tents
were erected in the grounds, but when
efforts were made to put beds into them it
was found that, being the ordinary field
tents used at military encampments, they
were not suitable for patients. It was a
matter of difficulty to get beds into them
t between the central pole supports and the ,
canvas. Even when that was accomplished
) the canvas would be uncomfortably close f
. to the faces of the patients.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Present position of Australian politics :
G. H. Reid is Barton’s Toby, Barton is Hope-
toun’s Toby, and Hopetoun is Chamberlain’s
Toby.
The S’African millionaire gang has formed
a meat trust, and is to import Argentine animals
to feed an all-red S’Africa. So Australia is left
again.
Labouchere, in a speech to his constitu-
ents : “ I have seen in a Jingo paper a statement
that it was kind of us to relieve the Boers of their
domestic duties. At this rate, Herod was a
philanthropist.”
There is a lot of wire-pulling with the
object of resuming the historic triangular reserve
in Macquarie Place, Sydney, for a Soldiers’
Memorial Hall. If Mr. John See carries his
Jingoism to this extent, he may find himself back
studying “ Sussex-street accountancy.”
The Freetrade push has carried obstruc-
tion to such a point now that the House of
Representatives lately spent a whole week trying
to pass one item of the tariff. And yet the same
crowd wants to know why the selection of the
Federal capital isn’t being proceeded with.
The British are doing their best to take
the Boers’ country, and yet some of their press
organs are shriekingly indignant because the
Boers are accused of taking the boots from the
wounded and prisoners. Now, probably the
Boers want the boots just as badly as the British
want the country.
It is now intimated that the Australian
State Premiers may possibly be allowed to go to
the Coronation at the cost of the British taxpayer
if Premier Barton recommends such a course. In
other words, the applicant must get a character
from Barton attesting that he is sober, indus-
trious, and doesn’t eat with his knife.
Melbourne’s birth-rate statistics look mis-
leading in the light of a recent week’s morgue
report. Four dead, and presumably unregistered,
infants came to light. Two of them were fished
from the Yarra, one was discovered in a brown
paper wrapper at the Botanical Gardens, and the
fourth was extracted from a load at the Burwood
“ tip.” The Melbourne man who goes out fishing
for infants never knows his luck.
PRACTICE FOR SOUTH AFRICA-PUBLIC MEETING BY KHARKI.
CHAIRMAN : “ Any other pro-Boer gentleman like to come up and make a remark!”
“Trotter”: Queensland has very many
meat works lying idle —Charleville, Hughenden,
St. Laurence, Cardwell, Biboohia (Cairns railway),
and Normanton, are all closed. What’s wrong
with the idea of turning some of them into bacon-
curing factories, which would give a tremendous
impetus to the farmer with worthless scrub
country ?
N.S.W. Marine Court of Inquiry into a
recent boiler explosion elicited the fact that only
boats trading from port to port, and steamers
carrying passengers are under the control of the
Department of Navigation. Tugs and scows are
exempt from Government inspection, and can
carry a deadly boiler about without any inter-
ference. Passengers’ lives have to be protected,
but, seemingly, seamen don’t matter.
nounced that Tattersall is shortly to get notice
of suppression—so far as he can be suppressed by
the refusal of the Post Office to carry his letters.
It would be interesting to know how Mr. Barton
managed so suddenly to thus assure himself of
the trend of public opinion.
Premier Leake (W.A.) has resumed busi-
ness at the old stand with two-thirds of the State’s
voting power behind him, but-* a precarious
Assembly majority of about one. A Civil Service
Reform Bill has been introduced, Conciliation
and Arbitration is being considered, and the tem-
porary (lapsed) Early Closing Act is to be re-
enacted. The proposed Redistribution of Seats
Bill will be drafted in recess, and when it is
passed, if it is passed, the House will dissolve,
and for the first time Westralia will have an elec-
tion on the basis of men rather than cattle.
Necessity of electoral reform in W.A. is
shown by the fact that the Opposition, repre-
senting one-third of the electors, is just as strong
in the Assembly as the Govt, side representing
two-thirds. Startling anomalies in individual
electorates : Hannan’s, 6,718 voters, one member ;
East Kimberley, 171 voters, one member.
From Reynolds’ Newspaper (London) :
Trade is as bad as it can be. Our financial contributor
shows that in two years, owing to the war, 325 of the
chief Government, railway, and other high-class stocks
have depreciated in value the enormous sum of
£144,000,000. To this add the sum, £250,000,000, which
the war has cost to date, and some idea will be had as to
the terrible gravity of the situation.
New South Wales now spends about
£3,000,000 a year of loan money to keep down its
unemployed trouble, and maintains five Labor
bureaux of one kind and another to find employ-
ment or relief for the workless, and yet the spectre
won’t keep down. In six out of the eight years
to end of 1901 the departures from N.S.W. ex-
ceeded the arrivals, and this is now the usual
condition of things in almost all the States of
the Commonwealth.
Melbourne bookseller Cole, in his book
demanding a black and piebald Australia, relied
mostly on his startling statement that had the
Redeemer sought to visit Australia he would have
been excluded under the Federal Undesirable
Aliens Act. This is a common statement with
allegedly pious Tories. The Bulletin isn’t very
pious, but the proposition that the Omniscient
couldn’t pass a simple language test is a depth of
blasphemy to which this paper hopes it will never
descend.
Walker, of N.S.W., is making some dis-
turbance in the Senate because two Asiatics were
not allowed to land in Australia. It seems they
were ex-soldiers of the Indian army, and Walker
has a shadowy idea that that fact should carry
them through. And if Mr. Walker and his
fellow Tories would be any the more willing to see
their daughters marry niggers because the niggers
are ex-soldiers, then there is something in their
theory. If they aren’t so inclined, then they
may begin to understand how Australia feels about
its daughters.
The appointment of Hugh Langwell,
M.L.C., to a salaried position in N.S.W., and the
mention of Sam. Smith, Alf. Edden, Ferguson,
and other M’s.L. A. for paid billets, would seem to
obliterate the old Parliamentary tradition that no
man should be lifted directly from a seat in Par-
liament to a position of profit under the Crown.
Jennings, Dibbs and Parkes tenaciously held that
a man should have resigned his seat at least six
months before his application for a Crown billet
could be entertained “ in the interests of the purity
of Parliament.”
How spinelessly vacillating ! The other
day Minister Drake said the Federal Government
would do nothing in the way of suppressing
“ Tattersall’s ” sweeps until it felt sure that it had
behind it the full force of public opinion. Four
or five days later Prime Minister Barton an-
The renegade
Radical, Cham-
berlain, rose to
political promin-
ence on a plat-
form of giving to
every Britisher
three acres and
a cow and an
old-age pension.
Perhaps it is in
fulfilment of the
first idea that he
is now making
a collection of
Boer acres and
Boer cows ; but
his war has made
old-age pensions
practically im-
possible in Great
Britain for many
years. The cost
of the campaign,
already over
£200,000,000, and
likely to far ex-
ceed that sum,
would have pro-
vided an old-age
pension fund
more generous
than any other
in the world.
There will
shortly be on
view two models,
in plaster, of
“ The Rocks ”
area (Sydney),
one showing the
locality as exist-
ing, the other
depicting the
streets and levels
as proposed by
the Advisory
Board. Dual con-
trol, however,
once again proves
the stumbling-
block to any-
thing like uni-
formity of action.
Part of the area
—that of the
water frontages
—is vested in the
Harbor Trust,
and that body is
takingindepend-
ent steps to re-model its section, and toe two im-
provement schemes must finally be dovetailed as
best they can.
Debate in the Federal House of Reps, on
the drafting of the military forces to a public
meetiug at Adelaide showed that members were
almost unanimous in opposition to the Govern-
ment. Watson (N.S.W.)T M‘Donald (Q.), G. H.
Reid (N.S.W.), V. L. Solomon (S.A.), Higgins
(Vic.), M‘Lean (N.S.W.). Conroy (N.S.W.),
Batchelor (S. A.), Ronald (Vic.), O’Malley (Tas.),
Solomon (W.A.), and Hughes (N.S.W.), all con-
demned the action of the Government, and only
three members spoke in its support. Only pity is
that the matter was not pushed to a division.
S.M. Herald in leader, January 31,
discusses the “Dread of War.” Alluding to our
ever flowing contingents it says :
”.j,., . , ,
These men are not defending their hearths and homes,
nor can it be said that their presence is essential to Great
Britain in terminating the war.
It is a trifle late in the day to discover that, hut
the S.M. Herald is slow on its feet, and always
comes breathlessly round the corner after the dog-
fight is over. Its greatest effort that way was
when it came out with an appeal for reconsidera-
tion of the sentences of the Mount Rennie
prisoners the morning they were hanged.
G.M. explains:

ire mortality in S African concentration camps. When
writer was last at the Irene camp, not far from Pretoria,
there was at least one death, generally that of a child, per
day, often more. No wonder they died. Men, women
and children, insufficiently clothed and poorly fed, hud-
died together in worn-out and rotten army tents, pitched
in a hollow. In wet weather they were flooded out; in
dry, nearly stifled with the closeness. No proper sam-
tary arrangements or medical attendance. Doctor didn’t
care whether they lived or died ; he was too tired to care.
There was a spruit about a quarter of a mile from the
camp, but the unfortunate wretches, although covered
with filth and vermin, were not allowed to bathe there for
fear they should escape.

By the appointment of Grainger as Agent-
General in London, and Roberts, M.P., as Adju-
tant to the new Federal squadron of farm-corn-
bustors, the Jenkins (S.A.) Ministry has got rid
of two menacing antagonists. It was Kingston’s
BRITANNIA AND HER MASTER.
“Mr. Kipling in his new poem appeals to the nation to face the necessities of imperial-
ism by accepting the conscription. He condemns the immense importance attached to
cricket and football, and accuses the British of fawning on the younger nations for men
who can shoot and ride.”— Cable.
THE MASTER : “ There now, and I set you another hundred lines to learn."
influence which got Roberts his adjutancy. The*
“ ratting ” of Roberts and Blacker in Dec., 1899,
brought about the defeat of the long-lived King-
st°n Cabinet; there was only a majority of one-
™. te ° n ‘he fatal No-Confidence motion. Now-
Kingston gets square. When. Roberts is bumping
heavily over the kopje m Africa he may begin fo-
realise that treacliery doesn t pay.
The newly-gazetted postal regulation
under which the P.M.G. may refuse to trans-
mit any publication which is found to be-
“ merely a repetition of literary matter contained
in a previous number, obviously for the purpose-
of circulating advertisements,” is well intentioned,'
but who will put it in operation? Numbers of
literary supplements do duty over and over again,
and "f h , e f n withdrawn from one State start a.
second life in another. They are often printed
from stereo-plates made in England or America,

The latest job of the Peacock crowd in
Victoria is the appointment of a draper to look
after the produce interests of the State in South
Africa. As soon as N.S. W. commenced appoint-
ing State Agents, Victoria woke up to the fact
that it was the proper thing to do, and Morrissey,
Minister for Agriculture, waded in. He an-
nounced that the Government was appointing a.
r , . , , l l ' n ... °
hrst-class man, and paragraphs appeared all over-
the papers for a Week telling how the rush of Vic.
produce to Africa would increase and swell up.,

. L f t ® Bt , Phll P move to discredit a White,
Australia is to refuse to lend money to the Gerald-
ton farmers for a central mill, as-
waf hl f that sugar cou!d n °t he grown there
without colored labor, and as no more Kanakas were to
he allowed he could not make the advances. Yet as the
™ on . ey had . b f e ® n borrowed for the purpose he would,
hand lt; f ove f r lf Barton s Government would make a.
guarantee for the return. He communicated that to Mr.
Barton, but so far had not the honor of a reply. If Mr.
Barton guaranteed the money he would be showing his-
faith in the Bill which he passed.
Unless phil is a phenomenally ignorant man he-
must know that Barton, in his official capacity,
has no power to make such a guarantee, and
could not make it without an alteration of the
Federal Constitution. And if Philp is not as-
ignorant as all that, what sort of political thimble-
rigging is this challenge ? Perhaps it is Barton’s
personal guarantee that he wauts.

Pianola in use with Upright Piano.
We are demonstrating the possibilities of this
remarkable instrument to all who call at our
exhibition rooms. We are always glad to show
the instrument to anyone sufficiently interested
to visit us. You need not feel the usual hesi-
tancy about going to see a thing you do not
expect to purchase, as we have rooms especially
set apart for displaying the Pianola, and
employ a large staff of men whose sole duty it
is to play the instrument and explain it to
visitors.
If you are unable to call, we shall be pleased to send
you a descriptive Catalogue on application.
The marked popularity of the Pianola in the home
leads to the belief that an examination of this instru-
ment is to the insterest of everyone.
Can be bought by monthly instalments if desired.

After he had heard the
Moszkowski said
“ Anyone hidden in a room
near by who will hear the
Pianola for the first time will
surely think it is a great virtuoso
who plays''
The literal truth of this statement
was demonstrated recently in an in-
teresting and very forcible manner.
M. Pugno, the celebrated French
pianist and the head of the piano
department in the Paris Conservatory,
was vis ing a gentleman in whose
house t..ere was a Pianola. The in-
strument was in the room next to the
one in which M. Pugno was being
entertained. Entirely unaware of the
Maurice Moszkowski
presence of the gre-u pianist, the son
of the host began playing the Pianola.
The piece he had selected was a very
difficult composition of Chopin’s, and
M. Pugno, after the opening chords,
ceased talking and began listening to
the music with every evidence of
interest and pleasure. He could not
see the performer and did not know
there was a Pianola in the house, but
he could hear and was attracted by
the music.
When the playing had ceased, he
immediately turned to his host and
said : “ Who was that playing? He
is really a remarkable performer.”
Raoul Pugno
To appreciate the full significance of
this wonderful tribute to the Pianola,
we must remember that M. Pugno is
not only a player of international
reputation—he is a teacher of the
piano, and at the head of this depart-
ment of instruction in the largest
conservatory in the world. He is ac-
customed and his ear is trained to
listen for every slightest defect in
touch, technique and expression It
is his business to do this. And yet he
not only did not know that he was
listening to the performance of an
automatic instrument but. on the con-
trary, he said that the player was a
wonderfully fine performer.
Ihe young man who played for
M. Pugno was not a musician,
and he only did what anyone can
do with a Pianola ajter a few
simple lessons.

Me. S. A. PALMER.
Dear Sir,—You will be glad to know of the cure your
medicine, VITADATIO, has worked on me. About 12
months ago I was attacked with inflammation of the
bladder. For eight months I was under the treatment
of three of the Sydney doctors, but their efforts failed to
cure me. In November last I commenced taking VITA-
DATIO, and in less than two months I was thoroughly
cured. I have had no trouble since then.
I trust this letter will be of use to you, and induce
others to try VITADATIO.
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) S. W. O’CONNOR.

La Grippe in Evidence.
Thirteen Deaths in One Week.
IT MAKES US THOUGHTFUL.
The Case of
Mrs. M. A. POOLE.
(by OUR REPORTER.)
The sixteenth century, which added to
our literature more than one mast' rpiece,
fed with its very mists the great streams of
the future. So many problems that were
then incomprehensible have been solved in
the intervening space of time that the lbt
has almost become monotonous in its length,
but an interesting addition appears below as
the result of a chat with Mrs. Mary Anu
Poole, of Taylor-street, West Maitland.
“I was once a resident of Branxton,”
said Mrs. Poole, “a small town about tifteen
miles from Singleton, and whilst livoig there
I had a very bad attack of influenza. I was
laid up for a long time, and when the fever-
ishness left me I was so weak that I could
hardly walk about, for when I had taken a
few steps a nasty giddy sensation came over
me and I had to sit down to avert the possi-
bility of falling. To make matters worse,
my legs were always aching, and the least
exertion made me tired. Anything in the
way of work I could not do, neither did I
have the inclination to do it even if I had
been able, as I lost all interest in everything.
I seemed to be held fast on the r cks of de-
spair, for I became so melancholy that all
hope was abandoned.”
“ What occasion had you to become so
hopeless ? ” asked the reporter.
“ Because my condition continued to get
worse every day, and although I was taking
medicine from a doctor, it did not check
the wasting disease from which I was suffer-
ing. When I had been under his treatment
for some time, I could see that it was use-
less to continue drinking his physic any
longer, and then 1 staited to take adver-
tised medicines. To my intense dismay
they all proved ineffective, and that is why
I became so despondent. Not far from where
I was living there were thirteen funerals in
one week, and the township was only a very
small one.C I’hose who hnd died were vic-
tims of influenza or its after eff cts, so that
I had every reason to be frightened, especi-
ally as I had a terribly, severe cough which
used to make my nose bleed with its violence.
I really thought I would never get over it,
as I could not sleep at nights and never got
any rest or peace from the agonies which
affected me. Very acute pains between the
shoulders added to my misery, and the ach-
ing sensations about my loins were too
dreadful for me to find words to describe.
No matter what was got for me I could eat
but very little of it, while some days my
appelite was so bad that food never passed
my lip?.® Just towards my usual time for
getting up I generally dozed off, and the
dreams I had then would astonish you.
Things that I used to wonder how they
could possibly come into my mind were
dreamt of, and they weie of such a horrible
nature that to think of them was enough to
make me shudder. But, then, you must
know that I was very nervous, and it took
little, and sometimes nothing at all, to start
my nerves trembling. I had apeculiaruneasy
feeling as if something was always worrying
me ; but this was not merely imaginations,
as I was never free from pain. I was so
weary of my wretched existence that I did
not care whether I lived or died. The
slightest exertion caused my heart to beat
and throb so much that I could scarcely get
my breath, and an affe tion of the chest,
which felt heavy and squeezed in, produced
a similar result. If I took a little nourish-
ment my stomach feit overloaded and
swelled out, and if anything was likely to
drive one to distraction it was the way my
poor head used to ache. Even the day light
made my eyes watery, and at times I could
see a strange mistiness before them which
made all objects dark and obscure. for
six weeks I could take nothing but a small
piece of toast steeped in tea, so you can
imagine how emaciated and feeble I became.
My complexion became almost yellow, and
I was surprised to find that my tongue was
nearly the same color, and if I could have
been relieved of the bitter taste in my
mouth I do not think I wou d have suffered
so much from a continual sense of sickness.”
“ I understand that you got relief from
all your troubles ? ”
“ So I did, but not till I commenced on
Clements Tonic, and as that medicine cured
me thoroughly I wish to convey a message
of gladness to the hear is-of all who are
suffering as I suffered. I forget how I got
to hear about Clements Tonic, but when the
idea entered my head to try it I soon had
some brought home, and I always look upon
that purchase of ( lements Tonic as the
means by which my life was sived. lam
not one of those people who expect some-
thing that the laws of nature regards as un-
reasonable, so that when I did not find an
immediate improvement in my condition I
was not at all discouraged, as I knew that I
had not taken a sufficient quantity of
Clements Tonic to give it a fair eh nee of
showing what it was made of, and I got
some more. It was then that 1 began to
feel my latent energies being fanned into
activity, and it was then that a healthy
feeling of hunger asserted itself. This was
more than I had experienced from all my
other medicines, and 1 showed my apprecia-
tion of the good already done by taking my
doses of Clements Tonic regularly. In pro-
portion to the quantity I consumed so did
my ailments vatdsh. I did not expert nc >
one night of restlessness, and my rest was
undisturbed by dreams. My meals were
properly digested, and I felt stronger from
day to day. The remarkable attainment of
strength which accompanied the use of
Clements Tonic had a grand effect upon my
nervous system, and before very long I was
quite free from my trou' lesoine cough.
The tightness in the chest an I difficulty in
breathing, besides the flat lcncc and pains
in the stomach, were matters which
Clements Tonic put aside, and my anxi ty of
mind was ended when the palpitation of my
heart was stopped. That these improve-
ments had really taken place there was no
doubt, yet I was so surprised after the way
other medicines caved in before my diseases
that I could hardly realise it. The purify-
ing influence of Clements Tonic was notice-
able in several ways, for I lost the nasty
taste in the mouth and my completion be-
came quite clear. My distressing headaches
and the pains in my back and shoulders
were likewise remedied, and in a few weeks
I had quite regained my old health and
strength This at one time appeared an
impossibility, so by that you can gauge the
high opinion I have of Clements Tonic.”
“ You desire others to know about your
cure 1 ”
“Certainly Ido, and you may publish
every word in any manner it pleases you.”

SUCH A CHANGE.
Not only in feeling but in looks. The skin is
clear, the eyes are bright, the cheeks are plump.
No more pain and misery, no more sick head-
ache, no more sallow complexion. What worked
the change ? Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills,
which cured the disease of the stomach that
prevented proper nutrition and also cleaned
the clogged and sluggish liver. Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills cure diseases of the stomach,
they cure diseases of the liver and kidneys, and
other organs which seem remote from the
stomach, because many of these diseases have
their cause in a diseased condition of the stomach
involving the allied organs of digestion and
nutrition. “ I write to inform you of the benefit
I have derived from the use of Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills,” states Mrs. E. M. Hay, Donald, Vic.
“Eor years I have been a great sufferer from
severe indigestion; in fact, taking of food was
painful, and work was an impossibility. I was
recommended to give these pills a trial; I did so,
obtained great relief, and have not had an attack
since. I still continue their use, as every dose
seems to improve my general health. Irecommend

SPORTING- NOTIONS.
The Hebrew bookmaker and the Gentile parson
have joined forces to suppress Australia’s one honest
gamble. The bookmakers have, to this end, poured out
money like water, and the result, ‘apparently, is that
“Tattersall” must go; it is officially announced that
nothing will be delivered to him through any P.O. in the
Commonwealth after March 31. This proclamation,
joined with the suppression of “Tatt.’s” advertising,
will probably prove too much for even the most
ingenious scheme which may be formulated to main-
tain the existence of Australia’s national lottery.
The news brings bliss to the Sydney betting-shops, the
proprietor of one of which has for several years net-
ted £lO,OOO at least per annum. “ Tattersall ” made 10 per
cent, out of the money gambled with him. The bookmaker
(generally by dubious practices) makes about 50 per cent,
of the cash which goes through his hands, and the diver-
sion of from £500,000 upwards from “Tatt.’s” gamble
means that a large proportion of it will go to the bookies.
It may be still possible for the sweeps to continue to cater
for the big city custom, but it is difficult to see how they
can survive as anything but shadows of their former
greatness. “ Tattersall,” by the way, must curse those
busybodies who, by their agitation, caused the amend-
ment of the Postal Bill in committee. Originally the Bill
only vetoed “ unlawful ” sweeps. “ Tattersall’s ’’ officious
friends laid stress on the fact that his were lawful affairs
—and the pietists and the bookies took the hint and an
amendment gave power to the Government to kill them,
lawful or not. The original intention of the Bill was un-
doubtedly to leave “Tatt.” in Tasmania, but to prevent
other sweeps being promoted on the mainland.

“E. and 0.E.” : In Brisbane the racing public
is spending most of its time propped against Queen-street
verandah-posts asking somebody for the loan of a
stronger adjective than “ blanky.” The Brisbane Jockey
Club, which is run by a small syndicate that raced 52
times a year at an annual profit of over £sooo—mostly
from tote percentages—has seceded from the registered
ranks because Queensland Turf Olub refused to grant it
more than 10 Saturdays in present half-year. Said syndi-
cate comprises former vice-president, secretary, and two
retired committee-men of Q.T.0., also the paid handi-
capper of latter club, and has held for some years a lease
of the Albion Park course, within 3d.-tram ride of Queen-
street. As the syndicate’s so-called club is not a legiti-
mate club within the meaning of the Totalisator Act, and
grossly violates principles of said Act by not devoting a
fair proportion of tote profits to increasing the stakes, it
is now urged that the Government should refuse to grant
it a totalisator permit. But the Philp Government is
feeling in its pockets for a stray sixpence, and the 2£ per
cent, (about £25 weekly) from the Albion Park tote helps
to stop some of the smaller cracks in the State revenue,
so the syndicate will probably continue to improve the
breed of racehorses by pocketing the receipts from the
Government gambling machine. This is not an argument
against the totalisator, but a very strong argument
against Philp. ' *

Gratia, winner of Rosebill Nursery, Saturday,
tops all two-year-olds seen out in N.S.W. for some time.
She never gave any of the other eleven starters a hope
from barrier rise. The filly is by Wallace from Lochiel
mare Loch Ness, from Nonsense by Albany. The stable’s
confident investments showed that it knew the good
thing. A trifle on this nag when she starts again ought
to bring some return.

Close connections gathered in many shekels
over the Grafton filly Eulas’ win of Subiaco Stakes
(6fur.), at Rosehill, Saturday. Still it was a huge
public surprise, considering' she met The Watch-
dog, T.M.S., and Santol, all well backed by the right
people. Eulas was bred by Mr. J. O. Thompson from
the Lochiel mare Loch Nea, a daughter of Barbara by
Barbarian from Adeline, one of the well-known Widden
dams, and promises excellently.
* * * *
The Watchdog jigged at Rosehill, Saturday,
with the right money on, but performed none too pro-
misingly. After playing up and getting off badly, he got
well forward in the straight, only to find four others much
too good for him, though he carried 51b. less than his
Newmarket burden, which won’t be humped now, as he
was eliminated Monday.

Street Arab, winner of Rosehill Maiden and
Suburban Handicap on Saturday, is not attractive,
though big, a good staying galloper and weight-carrier.
Owner, A. Busby, of whilom flier Bungebah, bred Street
Arab by Jeweller from Pirouette (also bred by Mr. Busby)
by Goldsbrough from Saltarelle, by The Drummer (imp.)
from Espagnolle, by Yattendon from Gunilda, by Cheddar
(or Coroebus) from Gunilda (imp.). Street Arab’s crowd
didn’t fancy him over much, as their full investments
didn’t exceed £2 at 25 to one ; but, despite 101 b. penalty,
his second success took a heap of the filthy from Mo.’s
profits. Both races were won easily, the heavy 8.3 of the
Suburban Handicap being treated like child’s play.
Writer labels Street Arab largely for future attention.

Second day, Saturday, of N.S.W.-England
match produced some of the finest cricket ever seen in
Sydney. Against the N.S.W. 432, Englishmen Maclaren
and Hayward, in 31 hours, put up 255, nearly 79 to
the hour. This is easily an Australian best for the
first wicket. The bowling was completely collared,
and the two cracks finished up the day in fine fix.
Previous Austral record was Shrewsbury and Bruce’s 196
in Melbourne in 1887, Non-Smokers v. Smokers ; and the
next, 187, by Mason and Wainwright of Stoddart’s last
team against S.A. The English first wicket best of 554
was put up by Brown and Tunnecliffe for Yorkshire
against Derbyshire in 1898
* • * «
Monday saw Maclaren and Hayward bring
their first-wicket record to 314 before former went back
to the pavilion with 167 (embracing nineteen 4’s), notched
in 31 hours. His scores on Sydney Cricket Ground so far
this tour are : 145, 73, 116, and 167—an aggregate.of 510,
and an average of 125.25. Hayward’s wicket went down
at 174, accumulated in just under 5 hours, during which
390 runs were put together ; he hit thirty 4’s and one 5.
Six hours and 20mins. batting saw 500 come—something
like 80 runs an hour. Tyldesley’s dismissal occurred
shortly afterwards for 142, made in 21 hours. He was at
the wickets while 332 were added, and included in his
contribution were twenty-one 4’s. In less than
25mins. Jessop had 50 opposite his name, and 7hrs.
20mins. of play brought 600 up. In one over
Jessop got 18 off Noble, and the big hitter
gathered 85 runs while Quaife was making 11.
With a total of 87, made in 57min. and embracing one 5
and fifteen 4’s, Jessop was clean bowled by M'Beth after
making things very lively and keeping the crowd in a
simmer of excitement. Garnett and Quaife were together
at stumps drawing, with 4 for 650, and every prospect
(bar rain falling) of wiping out the first-class record of
918 made by N.S.W. against B.A. Though nearly 1100
runs had been scored on it, there were no indications of
wear worth mentioning about the wicket. All four bats
out on this occasion did their best scoring for important
matches of the tour. On Tuesday, rain came and spoilt
the wicket and the record. At time of going to press the
Englishmen were all out for 769, and N.S.W. had 3
wickets down for 49 in the second innings—Hopkins,
bowled by Braund for a duck, O. Gregory caught by
Maclaren off Gunn for 7, and Poidevin run out for 9. S.
Gregory and Trumper are at the wickets.
* * * •
“A.M.”: Jessop’s 87 out of 103, made in 57
minutes (Quaife made 11, and 6 were sundries), showed
that the smiter has cricket in him. Admitting the
bowling was dead tired, and the fielding ditto, still Jessop
played a great game. He made but one weak stroke in a
really fine innings. Had Tyldesley, who made 142 in 128
minutes, been associated with Jessop, the rate of scoring
might have approached a record.
• * • *
Maclaren’s kick against his nominee Crockett’s
umpiring is the talk of cricket circles. Outside his own
particular following the complaint finds little sympathy.
It was not altogether unexpected, through leakages of
dressing-room curses. Some of the last English team
kicked against Jim Phillips, while others raised their fur
at Charlie Bannerman, who is filling Crockett’s place
now. The N.S.W. Cricket Association, at Bannerman’s
instigation, reported one of the team to the Marylebone
C.O. for calling the ancient willow king “ a cheat.”
English cricketers do not bow to the umpire’s decisions
with the good grace of the average Australian player.
* * * *
“ Stumps” : Won’t stand Maclaren’s excuse for
objecting to aboriginal Marsh playing for Bathurst.
“Questionable bowling” isn’t good enough in face of
Marsh having run the gauntlet of Sydney’s best umpires
during the past three seasons and only been no-balled
twice or thrice altogether—much less than others to
whom no exception whatever has been taken. “ Erratic
bowling and possible risks ” will not do either, for
Bathurst’s is a well-kept pitch, not one whit less accurate
than Sydney’s best. Are Marsh’s lightning deliveries
feared, or is the color line being drawn for the first time
in this section ? Maclaren while playing cricket is more
than endurable, but otherwise he’s getting himself very
much disliked.

Barnes, who is still in Adelaide, has had to
remain on his back with his knee in bandages. He badly
wrenched the muscles, and fluid accumulated under the
knee-cap. It is very probable that the fourth test in
Sydney will see him still standing out.
* * * *
“ A.M.”: Have figured out these batting aver-
ages for the three Tests playedßraund, 68 ; Armstrong,
67; Hill, 59; Maclaren, 48; Duff, 45; Hayward, 43.
Other end : Noble, 9 ; A. O. Jones, 6 ; M'Leod, 2. A. O.
Jones, picked for his batting, notched 31 in five innings •
Charlie M‘Leod amassed 7in three. Armstrong ow’es his
figures to three not-outs. In bowling Noble took 17
wickets at an average of 16 runs per wicket; Barnes, 19
wickets, averaging 17; Trumble, 17 wickets, averaging
21; Braund, 11, averaging 39 ; Howell, 3at 66 runs each ;
Jonah Jones, 1 for 131.
* • * •
“ J.G.” has a theory: “Not a few are surprised
at M. A. Noble’s falling off in batting, yet it is only what
might be expected. A first-class bowler has to do much
bowling. His eye gets accustomed to the flight of the
ball away from him and the perspective involved. Also,
he judges as to where it should land the best part of 20
yards away. Possibly a couple of hours afterwards he
takes the bat, and the laws of perspective involved and
the acts of judgment are completely reversed. He may
get his eye in or he may not, but he is handicapped at
the start. It is a matter for speculation as to what might
happen to Hill’s batting had he to bowl as much as
Trumble or Noble. Trumper is a splendid example of the
‘between two stools’ proverb. No man in Australia’s
best takes more out of himself in a short time with the
ball than Trumper. He aims at pace. He gets some,
but at what an expense ! Perhaps it would be better to
remodel the game altogether, having 13 a side. All
should field. But eight batsmen should bat only; four
bowlers, bowl only; one wicket-keeper, wicket-keep
only. Matches would not be drearily prolonged, and we
would get the best of everything. At present there is
much shandygaff in cricket."
* * • *
“B.B.”: Isn’t it time that Noble was removed
from the position of sole cricket selector for the State of
N.S.W. ? Farquhar, the consistent player in club cricket,
who showed excellent form in both innings against
Victoria, was asked to take twelfth place in the State team
against the Englishmen. This he declined. ’Tis said
that Iredale is so disgusted at the state of affairs that he
has definitely retired from cricket.
* * * *
Major Wardill goes to England as manager of
the forthcoming Australian team, provided Melb. 0.0.
grants him leave. The whole affair is a private spec., in
which Trumble, Hill, Noble, and Darling are running
preliminaries.
* * * *
Though the Victorians failed just when latest
inter-State match looked good for them, N.S. Wales
certainly had the luck. Vanquished side went to the
wickets the last time with a long journey before them.
During the major portion of Victoria’s initial innings the
wicket favored the bowlers and throughout half the
game Laver’s valuable aid was not available.
* * * »
of a Melb. club match: —“Stewart
bowled a fast ball to Wright, who snicked it into the
wicketkeeper’s hands, thence it rebounded on to the
wickets, knocked the bails off, and stuck between two
stumps. The wicketkeeper picked the ball out. and
claimed a catch, which was allowed by the umpire.”

The disgraceful scene when referee “Snowy”
Sturgeon declared the Jessop-Turner mill a draw at
Sydney Gaiety A.O. last week should make every properly
balanced man lay himself out to have fighting' men and
bruising halls sent to Hades. The crowd boohooed its
disgust as a Sydney crowd seldom boohooed before,
and Sturgeon slanged back with vigor and without
restraint. Runners of boxing halls who have any
self-respect and consideration for their patrons should
see him firmly and gently dropped right out of the
game for such conduct. All this apart from the
indisputable injustice of the decision ; for 16 of the 20
bitter rounds Jessop led unmistakably—the greenest new
chum could have seen that.

Rugby footballer-pug., Jack Conlon, and negro
“ Starlight,” who humps 50 years as though they were a
silk shirt, indulged in a cake-walk and runaway turn at
Sydney Golden Gate A. 0., Saturday night. “ Starlight”
cake-walked and Conlon did the runaway-turn, and a huge
audience grasped that from end to end it was absolute
make-believe. First “ Starlight ” tried to take refuge among
the audience, or in the sewer, but couldn’t get past the
ropes. Then Conlon’s heart failed him, and Starlight
grunted ferociously, and looked absolutely terrible as
long as Conlon fled round the ring like a lost spirit
before: a fiend with a toasting-fork. The “grand
flou r-eesh ” was when Conlon rushed and carefully sprawled,
and the gravity of his large feet swung him into an
upright position again, to promptly sink permanently
while the ebon-hued array of legs and wings whirled
harmlessly around him. A thick voice said “Starlight”
was the winner, and as nobody disputed it, he is recorded
as such.
“ Old Timer” : Whilom doyen of the Australian
P.R., Mat Hardy, died in Ballarat Benevolent Asylum,
aged 73. Mat flourished in the fifties, when Ballarat was
going strong, and bruisers from ’Ome and Yankeedom
flocked there in droves. Harry Sellars, Bob Phee, Bob
M‘Laren and co. were contemporary with Hardy, and
went under to him in turn. Mat made wealth, but
couldn’t hold it. Gout and rheumatism made life unbear-
able to him for years past.
* * * *
“Snell”: Yic. papers speak of Mat Hardy—
just dead—as an unwhipped champion. If he was so,
very ancient miners are all dreamers, for they tell of a
great battle with famous Joe Kitchen in which Mat got a
sufficient doing. Mat was a wonder in his way—went at
it from the jump like a man possessed with a ten-head
battery of devils, and usually did his opponent up within
a few minutes. Kitchen, one of the best “ scientists ”of
his time, waited for him coming, stood strictly on the
defensive for the first three rounds, and then sailed in.
Hardy’s last fight that I have knowledge of was against
Alf Maclaren, brother of Bob the notorious. Hardy was
then a portly publican of 40, running the Hermit’s Cave
on old Main Road, Ballarat. The battle happened at
Warrenheip, and Maclaren took home damages enough to
lend an air of verisimilitude to half a score of now-a-day
encounters.

Five hundred yards swimming .supremacy of
N.S.W., Saturday, at Lady. Robinson’s Beach, was a soft
snap for Read, through Dick Oavill spraining an ankle.
Water was opposed to record-making, but Read shaped
well, and finished 2 4-ssec. outside Australian best, owned
by Dick Cavill. Read, Lane and Cavill may meet in
the 220 yards premiership at Bronte (Sydney) to-day,
Saturday, though it is more proba le that only the better
of the first two (they are in the same stable) will compete
with Dick of Farm Cove, in which case there will be
a high tension tussle between Lane and Cavill over every
inch of the furlong, with little to spare when the judge
speaks.

At contest for the plunging supremacy of N.S.
Wales at Goulburn, last week, the only competitors were
ex-champion Keers and immediately previous holder, W.
M'Donald. Water being fresh was unfavorable to big
achievements. M'Donald’s best effort was his first—
47ft.—which Keers overlapped by 10ft. 3in. There’s
nothing attractive about plunging, which, being remini-
scent of many doleful Moody and Sankey hymns, usually
has a depressing influence upon one.

Young Galey, a promising Bananaland
swimmer, is said, on three different occasions, to have
been clocked to do “ trial hundreds ” in 1.3 1-5, 1.3 and a

prove, and, on promise, should beat the best in Victoria,
South Australia and Maoriland, and give anyone in
N.S.W., bar Lane or Cavill, a hot time over the sprint
distances. Anyhow, it’s time Queensmongreland pro-
duced a champion.

tralasian champion Daley was not in it through mislead-
ing information as to starting point. 0. A. Messenger
(47sec. behind scratch) proved too good for the rest in
the All-Comers’ Sculls Handicap, and H. Pearce, a lusty-
limbed veteran over 50 years old, appropriated the

One of the Wheat State’s seventh batch of

Last year the Dunlop Tyre Go. tried to arrange
for permission for amateur road riders to compete in the
big Dunlop road race from Warrnambool to Melbourne,
but the League of Victorian Wheelmen could not grant
the necessary permission. An endeavour is now being
made to see if there is any possible chance of the League
granting a permit for this year’s classic road event
—amateurs to receive trophies in the event of their
winning. Should the necessary permission not be forth-
coming, it is more than likely that the Dunlop Tyre Co.
will run two events on the one day over the famous 165
miles’ course, the amateurs leaving an hour before the
League riders. An announcement will be made at an
early date, so that road riders will have plenty of time to
prepare for this classic road race.*
Premier Philp, of Queensland, has pub-
lished his election manifesto, and no cheekier
document was ever issued by any Australian
politician since a certain person ceased to put his
1.0.TJ. in circulation. Philp has the blastiferous
assurance to say that Queensland, which returned
a huge anti-nigger majority at the Federal poll,
and supported the Barton Government’s anti-
nigger policy all along, is so bitterly disappointed
at losing its nigger that it wishes now it had
never federated. The Philp push knows so
positively that this isn’t true that it dare not go to
the polls on a one-man-one-vote basis and give
Queensland a chance to express its feelings by
dropping Philp and all his gang into political
perdition.
The amusing Dick Seddon said, when he
sent off his Bth contingent, that he would, if
necessary, begin the equipment of a 10th con-
tingent, and that “it was only by pouring in
troops that the war could be brought to a close.”
Well, if Seddon could send a contingent of 50,000
men at once he might talk of “ pouring in troops.”
Less than that is useless. A military correspon-
dent lately told the Times that the yeomanry now
being sent out are not equal to the first batch, and
that they are enlisting the “ flotsam and jetsam of
the seaports ”in the Cape local corps. The plain
truth is that the recruit market is “tight,” and it
is a serious question whether the numbers can be
kept up. There are 3000 miles of communications,
and long and lengthening lines of blockhouses to
protect, railways to be worked, and the adminis-
trative services to man. Then there cannot be
less than 30,000 sick always in the hospitals, and
as the duty gets harder that number will increase.
It is a serious question whether the numbers of
men now being sent out will more than suffice to
fill up the gap in the ranks. “ Pouring in troops,”
forsooth !
A patriotic citizen, whose language is
quoted by Sydney Telegraph :
If persons met like that in any other country outside
the United Kingdom, and gave expression to such
traitorous sentiments regarding their own army, they
would most probably all have been shot as quickly as the
authorities could lay hands on them. Liberty under the
British flag seems to be: mistaken by some people for
license, and the sooner they are taught a lesson the
better.
If it comes to that—in what British community
would foreigners be allowed to publicly petition
a representative of their foreign Government to
come and take possession of the country, as the
British residents in the Transvaal were allowed to
do with impunity in 1877 ?

pal, who believes in straight tips, was going into the
course a short time ago when he picked up a piece of
iron. Taking it as a straight tip for the two Irons, he
put his bit on, and both Cast Iron and Hoop Iron won.
He got The Watchdog one time through a friend trying
to sell him a very inferior dog at a very high price on
morning of race. Backed Queen of Sheba on the strength
of seeing the picture in gallery day, before race. Had

“N.” : Journalists of experience cannot
fail to meet with the man in their profession who
gets on in spite of a sublime oontempt for news,
and newspapers get on that way, too. After the
cable about General Booth’s eldest daughter,
Catherine Booth-Clibborn, and her husband, join-
ing Dowie (!!!) one naturally panted to see what
the War Cry said about it. Well, you might
pant. Not a word. Yet Catherine has been
talked of as General Booth’s possible successor.
Suppose Dowie collars the whole swag !
“Curly ” Jones, the lady-like little Sydney
attorney who —alas ! — used to be M.L.A., arises
in his Jingo wrath and calls upon all local
university men to assemble and demand the
dismissal of Prof. Wood from the Chair of History
failing a satisfactory “ explanation ” of his atti-
tude re the Boer war. In which connection it
may be observed that the rage of the sheep is
very terrible ; so also is that of the silkworm, and
the Italian greyhound and the pink-eyed rabbit.
“Shining-billy” Inglis, another Jingo Sydney ex-
M.L.A., is also, out after the Professor’s scalp and
has written to the Senate “drawing attention.”
Like all “right-thinking” public bodies the.
University Senate is in the aggregate fiercely
Jingo. The undergraduates are much divided in
opinion. k
Some men would almost need a reaper
and binder to gather in all the wild oats they have
sown in their harum-scarum days. We could tell
a tale —but no. In a moral sense every man has
got to sleep on the bed he has made for himself.
Physically there is no such necessity—he may
sleep on any bed he can afford. And what is
wrong with a Brass or Nickel Double French
Bedstead, with Double-wove Wire Mattress,
Kapok Mattress, Bolster and two Pillows, for
£6 155., at M'Lean Bros, and Rigg, Ltd., 107
Elizabeth-st., Melbourne?*
Sydney Labor League’s true attitude on
the S’African war (the lying Jingo press, and
Earticularly one billet-hunting organ, has tried
ard to misrepresent it) : (1) the League con-
ference, representing 120,000 voters, officially and
without a protest from a single member, gave a
sympathetic greeting to the Anti-War League
deputation; (2) the conference, after a desperate
rally-up of Jingoes,-refused by 36 votes to 35 to
sign an anti-war petition, the ground for the
refusal of most of the 36 representatives being
that they could not bind their unions and leagues
to that extent; then (3) by 38 votes to 23 the con-
ference carried the following :
“That this conference believes that, with a view to
terminating the war in South Africa, autonomy such as
we enjoy in Australia be immediately granted to the
Transvaal and Orange River colonies, and that ruined
farms be re-stocked, and an amnesty granted to all Oape
rebels in arms.
N.S.W. Labor party thus definitely declares its
opposition to the Chamberlain war policy.
There is an ocult explanation for most
happenings. And the secret of Lord Hopetoun’s
constitutional mistake at the A.N.A. luncheon is
not far to seek. He must inadvertently have
sought inspiration from the wrong bottle. Had
he stuck to his old friend, D.C.L. Whisky —for
D.C.L. is the best friend of all the wise—the
amiable Scawtch gentleman never could have
fallen into error of speech or conduct. No one
has ever regretted a faithful adherence to the
Whisky which prompts its consumers to say the
right thing in the right place.*

LAME BACK and WEAKNESS.
Brisbane, Jan. 4, 1902.
Dear Sirs,—lt gives mo great pleasure to state that my health has much im-
proved since I have been wearing the Belt I received from you. I sleep well at
light, and feel refreshed in the morning, and am ready for work. The pain in my
back and the feeling of weariness has gone. I am happy to say lam getting
stronger in body and nerve—thanks to your Belt. I would not part w'ith it for
fifty (£SO) pounds if I could not secure another. It far exceeds my expectation.
My friends congratulate me upon my healthy appearance, and say I look ten years
younger, and wish to know what lam taking. I tell them it is Dr. McLaughlin’s
Belt that has caused the change.
Dear Sirs, I pray that your firm will long be spared to do good for suffering fellow
creatures. —I remain, Yours respectfully,
JOHN KING.
SCIATICA and LUMBAGO.
Dr. McLAUGIILIN CO., CITY. Sydney, January 18, 1902.
Dear Sirs,—ln answer to your letter, asking about my condition, lam glad to
say that my sciatica is gradually leaving me. The doctors told me a while back
that I would never get well, or go to work again, but I am now working
every day. My general health is very much improved ; in fact, it seems O.K. ; and
I am convinced by my experience so far that I am going to get well.
I am telling my friends of the benefits the belt has given me, my leg hardly
ever pains me, and I am more than satisfied so far.
The day I bought your belt I could scarcely walk ; in fact, I was so crippled
that I did not want to leave the house, but I bless the day that I called at your
office. I hope any fellow-sufferers may profit by my experience.
Yours very' gratefully,
Kegworth-street, Leichhardt. W. J. OGLESBY.
Dr. MCLAUGHLIN CO.
Dear Sirs, —I received your letter. lam using your belt with good results, the
Lumbago which I suffered with for thirty years is greatly relieved, and the Sciatica
which I have suffered with so much I hardly feel at all now. Thanks to your belt,
lam doing’ well. If this should be the means of any sufferer trying your belt, you
are at liberty to make any use you like of the letter. I have been using your belt
about a month, and would not part with it. Wishing you success,
I remain, yours sincerely,
133 Denison-street, Camperdown. * (S.) JOHN LITTLE.
INDIGESTION and DYSPEPSIA.
A SYDNEY ENGINEER’S PRAISE.
Dr. McLAUGHLIN CO., SYDNEY. “ Kelso,” Calvert-st., Marrickville.
Dear Sirs,--I have been using one of your high-grade belts now for about six
weeks. My principal trouble was CHRONIC DYSPEPSIA, and a general run-down
condition.
I can say truthfully that my food digests a great deal easier, and I sleep better
since using it, and I hope to be entirely well in three months’ time. Of course, a
man 67 years of age, as I am, can’t expect to be cured in a day. I am telling my
friends of the benefits I am receiving from the Belt, and am glad to testify to its
merits.—Yours very respectful y, HUGH JONES.

CORNER ELIZABETH AND BATHURST STREETS, SYDNEY.
HERR RASSMUSSEN (HANS PETER RASMUSSEN),
The Celebrated Danish Botanist,
Proprietor and Discoverer of the World-Famed Alfaline Herbal Remedies,
which have been the means of effecting the most marvellous Cures for Blood,
Skin and Nervous Diseases ever heard of in Australia.
Herr Rassmussen’s Australian Career:
It is about Twenty Years since Herr
Rassmussen introduced his Herbal Remedies
to the Australian Public. At that time
he was only known to the public as a Botanist
pure and simple, having devoted almost his
whole life to the study of that most useful
and interesting branch of science. It how-
ever, soon dawned on Herr Rassmussen that
immense virtues existed in many plants which
were entirely unknown to medical men, and
that it was his duty towards his fellow man
to bring these new discovered Herbal Remedies
within the means of suffering humanity.
Herr Rassmussen at once set to work,
and his entire energy was directed towards
extracting the medical properties from all
kinds of plants, and putting them up in the
most suitable and practical form, according
to the Dature of the complaints which they
had been found a cure for.
Pills and Powders were found to be the
most practical form to administer these new
Herbal Remedies.
It is unnecessary to particularise here the
immense success Herr Rassmussen met with
in his venture twenty years ago ; suffice it to
say that in less than twelve months the
great and wonderful cures brought about by
his Alfaline Herbal Remedies were known
throughout Australia, New Zealand, and many
other parts of the world. Testimonials and
Honors arrived from all parts. Gold Medals
from Paris and other places were awarded, and
Herr Rassmussen’s name has been a house
hold word ever since.— (Sydney Press.)

A Pentridge warder relates how, years 1
ago, a burly prisoner used to break stones to the?
constant droning of an ancient larrikin catch-
phrase— “ And the villain still pursooed ’er ! ” The
warder heard this so often that it became insepar-
ably associated in his mind with that criminal.
Quite recently he was on Spencer-street station
waiting for a train when a man of gorgeous
appearance attracted his attention. He was
accoutred in frock coat, tall hat of the shiniest,
gold chain—yet there was a curious something
that brought back a half-forgotten phrase to the
warder’s mind. He strolled up close to the vision,
and taking out his watch, contemplated it for a
second or two, then muttered just loud enough
for the other to hear —“And the villain still
pursued her ! ” Three seconds later the back view
of an elegant frock coat was making good time
towards Kew.

THE
The “Allenburys” Foods provide nourishment suited to the growing digestive powers
of the Infant, and constitute an altogether distinct advance on the mischievous expedient of trying
to make the child’s stomach accomodate itself to a food essentially unsuited to its digestive powers.
Farinaceous foods of all kinds are totally unfit for infants under five or six months of age, such foods
being a potent cause of digestive troubles, rickets, and many disorders arising from mal-nutrition.
The “JMlenburys ” Foods are especially valuable in hot
climates. They are in the form of powder and keep perfectly.

E.S. : Miss Rose Hamilton—the breeziest and most
substantial figure among the “Aladdin" brethren—irri-
tates me exceedingly in one little bit of scene she has
with Ada Willoughby (of the thin legs). Possibly, she is
upset by some wildly mirthful proceedings that are going
on in the wings ; at all events she sometimes laughs half
through the song, and leaves the rather weaker vessel—
Ada—to bear an undue share of the burden.
“Spring”: According to General Wallace’s book, Ben
Hur wins the great chariot-race by deftly hooking his
Roman rival s wheel with his own, bringing the Roman
to grief. This unsportsmanlike action, if presented on
the stage, will leave a nasty taste in the mouth of
Australian Sports—even those who frequent the pony
A lion escaped from Fitzgerald’s circus at Broken Hill
last week, killed a goat, played skittles with the acetylene
gas plant and then “ took up a commanding position on
an embankment.” The police were about to shoot
the animal when Herr Zaff, its trainer, succeeded in
beguiling it&back to its cage with bribery and corruption
in the shape of meat.
Miss Rose Hamilton, who has a good deal of the old
original Nellie Farren sprightliness, will take over the
principal “boy” part from Nellie Stewart when
“ Ala,ddin ” opens at Sydney. Meanwhile she is going to
play it at some of the matinees in Melbourne.
At Melb. Opera House the other night a 'tec. walked
into the d.c. and arrested a girl who had been a minor
item in Rickards’ 00. until the first part was abolished.
Her trouble was all along of floral tributes. She had got
bouquets on her poor little stage-struck brain. Ordered
90s. worth of roses and things at a florist’s, took some of
them away with her, and was arrested on a charge of
obtaining the goods under false pretences. The girl’s
idea, seemingly, was to start a mutual admiration society
by giving bouquets to her friends from whom she ex-
pected to get similar vegetables in return.
Another visiting stage-performer now lies buried in
Adelaide. Dp Wynne was a fairly good juggler, and an
absolute expert at shadow-pantomime, a somewhat old-
fashioned amusement which he revived with great effect.
He went through his recent season at the Tivoli with oc-
casional interruptions from a trouble which ultimately de-
clared itself as typhoid. The profession, as usual, showed
up generously at the funeral.
Surely it was a malicious Fate that permitted the
comp’s, error, “ Maggie Moore as the Oolleen Brawn ’’ to
stand in a Melbourne paper.
“ Alex. M.” : Hadn’t sampled Williamson’s operatic
folk until I found myself the other day at an “ Ernani ’’
matinee. Verdi is never afraid to kick up a row, and in
“Ernani” he runs a boiler factory hard for clangour.
Better clangorous than langorous, however, when the
c'.angs are those of a composer who is never by any chance
unmelodic. I pass the ladies—Signora Benedetto
and Marchi—because the latter had no solo-
work to do, and because the former, who had
plenty, was ineffective, except in the sudden altitu-
dinous screeches with which Verdi so liberally
bedizens his soprano and tenor scores. Larizza, who was
the other half of a painfully podgy and unromantic
“leading” pair, did his shrieking with both will and
skill. A very resonant tenor of the “ dramatic” brand ;
splendid energy of style; capital intonation; notable
precision Of attack. Travaglini—not too successfully
elderised as Old Dad Silva-kept up that ancient’s end
creditably with a respectable bass, a trifle woolly in
quality, but artistically used. For Bozzoli, as the King,
however, there can be nothing' but praise. Not much
of an actor (but we don’t go to opera for the acting),
he has a very fine voice of specific baritone t3’pe—free
alike from suggestion of bastard bass or of aborted tenor.
Possessing.also great power, fine breadth of style, and
admirable delicacy of expression, I am not sure that I
should plaee Bozzoli behind any baritone I have heard in
Australia. The chorus work was refreshingly crisp and
energetic, and the orchestra blared and tootled and
twanged and banged like so many demons, under the
iron rod of the magnetic Hazon.
“ J.A.0.”: A correspondent (B. 25/l/’O2) says: “It is
not suspected that several members of Williamson’s
Italian Opera 00. are quite incapable of singing music at
sight, and others can’t read music at all.” Nothing won-
derful in this. It is the case with every opera co. And,
apart from music, I have known many eminent Italian
vocalists who could not read anything. I once heard the
celebrated tenor, Guiseppe Fancelli (whose voice was as
soft as velvet, with the brilliancy of a silver trumpet,
and whose vocalisation was perfection), say: “ I have
known many singers who can’t even write their own
names. Now, I don’t pretend to be educated, but I can
at least write my name.” Yet, when he went to fulfil an
engagement in St. Petersburg, he spelt himself in the
hotel-register “ Guseppe Fanculi.” There is little doubt
that English, French and German singers are better all-
round musicians than their Italian confreres, though the
former frequently lack the indescribable “ something ”
possessed by the latter.
or. rom S.M. Herald : “ By special license, on Dec.
r?.’ 1851, bv Rev. O. F. D. Priddle, Mr. S. H. Taylor to
Miss Sara Flower.” Miss Flower was the glorious singer
whose remains have been removed from Devonshire-street
cemetery to La Perouse. Can any old Poverty Pointer
say if Mr. S. Taylor was the same gentleman known on
the stage as “ Sam Howard,” whom Miss Flower is said to
have married?

This Stands to Reason
RUPTURE "* HERNIA
Should be Cured at once, and Cured
to stay Cured —r
The cure of Rupture and all diseases of men has for years engaged the attention of
the members of the Staff of Specialists of the Electro-Medical and Surgical
Institute. They understand more fully than most experts the disastrous
possibilities arising from these affections.
-7—7'
■ a a
THE INSTITUTE.
Tlie wisdom of having all pelvic disorders cured in their earlier stages is patent to all, whether they are sufferers or
not, who are in the least familiar with the intimate relations existing between such disorders and the constitution in
general. The Specialists’ advice is: Take a short cut to Health ; seek it in perfection ; have no time lost in
making experiments ; go and talk your matter over with these able Specialists ; look over the Institute and
consider its wonderful equipments and conveniences for treatment of all kinds of disease ; peruse the testimonials
received by the Specialists from thousands of persons cured of Rupture and other afflictions, and then consult your
thoughts, judge and act wisely and determinedly.
If you have a Rupture and do the latter, you will
find that you have a splendid chance of being cured
without any unnecessary experiments being made upon
the locality of your trouble. Ruptures are very
dangerous affections, especially that kind
which develops into a Strangulated Hernia and
which, if not attended to at once, may mean a
dangerous and painful operation attended sometimes
with fatal consequences. A Rupture is such a
serious matter that it is a criminal act of folly for any
person who. does not understand it to endeavor to
cure or even attempt its relief. Only men with
special knowledge can ever hope to permanently
cure them.
A “Kachet” Truss.
“ Mock-Main " Levkr Truss.
There are several kinds of Rupture. To the unenlightened there is the
Oblique, Encysted, Direct and Inguinal or more properly
termed Single and Double Ruptures. Testimonials prove
that more men have been cured of this class of affec-
tion by the Specialists of the Institute than by any
association of men or medical practitioners in
the Commonwealth. Their treatment is more rational, modern
and effective, than that in vogue by the usual practising physician. It is
not sufficient to relieve, it is necessary to cure permanently all diseases
that are curable. It is to this end the Specialists concentrate their
endeavors.
There is no royal road to learning, but the way to permanent Health is visible to everyone.
Rupture may be considered curable, unsuccessful treatment determines differently. It depends upon your medical
attendant whether you are cured or not. Therefore it is as plain as a pikestaff that if an association of
medical Specialists have qualified by special study and application of time to the treatment of special classes of
disease, it stands to reason they are the people to be consulted in times of danger and of peril. Other persons
have been cured, why should you not be ? The sworn testimonies from sufferers should convince you.
Read this : A relieved sufferer writes “ I suffered from an Encysted Hernia for some time, but was not
permanently cured until operated upon by you. lam now strong and healthy, and do not even require the use of
the truss provided by you in case I required it.”
Melbourne, 1901.
Again: Mr. .writing from W.A., states:—“The Rupture from which I suffered was of such a decided
character that it defied all efforts for a permanent cure. My sufferings were very great, and when I came to you I
was not sanguine of a remedy. Your special modes of treatment performed wonders for me, and at present lam in
possession of better health than I ever expected to enjoy.”

“Mr. W. G. Hearne, Geelong.—
“ Dear Sir,—
Your letter and Bronchitis Cure to hand quite safe.
I am sure you will be glad to know that your Bronchitis
Cure has quite cured me. I was very glad when it came,
as I was suffering from a severe attack of Bronchitis at the
time it arrived. I had sent for my own doctor, but had
not had one night’s rest for a week. I started taking the
Bronchitis Cure three times a day as directed, and was
very much eased at once. At the end of a week I only
took it twice a day, and then only every night for a
week, as I was so much better when, thanks to the Lord
for adding His blessing, I was quite well, and walked into
town and back without feeling any fatigue. I had not
done that previously for 12 months—always went in the
omnibus—as walking caused me such pain and distress in
the chest. I always walk now, and never feel it, and I
am stronger than I have been for years. I thank my son
for his great kindness in sending the medicine, and am
dear Sir,
“Yours very truly,
“M. MORTIMER.’
Extract from a letter, since written by the same lady to
her son, Mr. John S. Mortimer, Llenwellyn, Katunga,
Victoria.
HER DAUGHTER HAD BEEN VERY ILL.
SPITTING UP BLOOD.
THE DOCTOR SAID NOTHING MORE COULD BE
DONE.
CURED BY HEARNE'S BRONCHITIS CURE.
The extract runs as follows“ As for myself, thank
the Lord, lam feeling stronger than I have for years. I
had an attack of Bronchitis in November, but Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure was again successful. I feel quite well,
and walk into town feeling quite strong.
“ I must ask you to send me six bottles more of the
medicine, as I wish to have a supply in the house. I
have tried to get it made up here, and let my chemist
have a bottle to see what he could do. He tells me this
week he can make nothing out of it, he never saw any-
thing like it before, so there is only one thing for me to
do—send for more. I have never kept in bed one day
since I commenced to take it. I used to be in bed a fort-
night at a time always, and after that for months I was
as weak as I could possibly be, and was always taking
cod liver oil, so you will see at once it is quite worth
while sending for it such a long distance.
“ Something more I must tell you. Charlotte has been
very ill since I wrote you. Her cough was so bad she
never had a night’s rest, and was spitting up blood
very much. The doctor told her husband that there was
nothing more he could do for her. So on the Sunday I
sent her half a bottle of the Bronchitis Cure, and told
her to try it, and if she did not use it, not to waste it,
but send it back again. She had such confidence in her
doctor that I thought she would not try it. On the
Wednesday I sent over again, and she was much better,
the night’s rest was very good, and cough and bleeding
from the lungs better. She sent for another half-bottle,
and on the following Sunday sent over to say that she
was quite cured and did not require any more medicine.
So you see what great good it has done, and she wishes
to have some of my next supply."

“Sir.—My wife was for twelve years a sufferer from

be removed or even eased by any remedy, doctors’

and difficulty of breathing, etc., were entirely removed by
the fifth dose of your Bronchitis Cure.—l remain, Sir,

for five years, and now I do not feel safe to be without it.

EXPECTORATING BLOOD AND MATTER.
COMPLETELY CURED.
“ Mr. W. G. Hearne.
‘‘Dear Sir, —Your medicine has cured me of bronchitis
ana asthma, from which I suffered for upwards of seven
years, during which period I was scarcely ever free from
coughs, and frequently the difficulty of breathing was so
distressing that for nights in succession I had to sit up.
I write you this acknowledgment from a sense of duty, as
mmy case every other treatment had failed. For a year
previous I had been getting very much worse, and at the
time I obtained your medicine I was confined to bed
suffering from a most violent cough, expectorating blood
and matter, and apparently beyond hope of recovery.
The first dose of the medicine gave me welcome relief
and I steadily improved as I continued the treatment’
until I became, as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely'

The Speculative Builder.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Aunt Marian bought the house she had
more of an eye to the gas globes than to the foun-
dations. The former were pretty ; the latter
more than pretty bad. The brickwork was
abominable, but there were Venetian blinds to all
the windows. The sanitary arrangements were
disgraceful, but the garden paths were nicely
gravelled. The roofing was defective, but the
bathroom was fitted with a hot-water tap—for
ornament only, not for hot water, as we subse-
quently discovered. Aunt Marian resisted the
gas globes, the Venetian blinds, the gravelled
paths, the hot-water tap, and even the glib tongue
of Mr. Slumemup, the builder, for a time ; but,
under the impression that the imitation graining
on the joiner’s work was the natural surface of a
choice Maoriland wood, she finally succumbed.
After we moved in, trifles, like the fall of a
mantelpiece, the partial collapse of an arch, the
arrival in the soup-tureen of portions of the
ceiling, or the departure of a few yards
of roofing on the wings of the breeze,
did not disturb my equanimity. Such things
are to be expected in a builder’s house.
But what did annoy me was the state of the
garden. Having bulbs to plant, I picked out a
likely-looking bed, and began the attack. Then
I discovered that most of the beautifully smooth
and elaborately-planned garden beds consisted of
a thin layer of soil spread over an assortment of
building and other debris, of endless variety and
unknown depth. My complaints were repeated
to Mr. Slumemup. He said I might know some-
thing of building, but I evidently knew nothing
of gardening. What I objected to were agricul-
tural drains. These cold, impervious subsoils, he
explained at great length, and with bright tears
in his eyes, needed draining. He had done his
best, but it seemed his fate always to be mis-
understood. Now, there may have been some
sort of truth in this. I have had the luck not to
“go on the land ” so far, and hence am hardly an
authority on such matters. But I think I should
E refer agricultural drains with fewer old tins and
roken bottles about them. Also, my idea of
drains is that they should go in some particular
direction, and not lie all over the premises in a
promiscuous manner. Further, I fancy, there
should be some sort of proportion between the
drains and the subsoil. All drains and no subsoil
appears lit* l ® better than all subsoil and no
drains.
In laying on the gas, Slumemup had taken care
to provide plenty of work for plumbers—he has a
brother in the trade —and had put in the pipes
with a fall from the street main. The result was,
that when you turned on the tap, you struck
water almost as often as gas. This was annoying,
and led to further remonstrance. However,
Slumemup intimated in his usual vague sort of
way that it would have been all right only for the
gas stove we had put in.
During dry weather the numerous cracks in the
house made great headway; they would first admit
your finger, and a little later on your fist. When
it rained the cracks would rapidly close up, and
presently, as the swelling continued, the house
would begin to bulge, and buckle, and overlap.
Slumemup was not to be alarmed by our com-
plaints. He knew of an iron bridge that had done
a mile o» its own through expansion and con-
trition.
Our bay window was always very much cracked
and not too safe, but it gradually went from bad
to worse. One night the house was struck by
lightning, and a tram off the line ; there were also
an earthquake and a cyclone; so, at least, I
gathered from the excited remarks which reached
me when I was wakened. However, on getting
my wits and the bedclothes about me once more,
I guessed the expected had happened, and said so.
I also said there was nothing for it but to sleep on
it. The rejoinder, however, was a flat refusal to
sleep in a house after the front had fallen out —
women always fuss about trifles—coupled with a
demand that I should turn out and learn the
amount of the damage. This, I found, was not so
extensive after all. A quantity of plaster had
fallen, but, although part of the wall leaned out-
wards at a considerable angle, it still stood. It
was held in position, probably, by that undefined
something in nature generally known as ‘ stick-
tion,” to which the speculative builder pins his
faith, and by which his house continues to hang
together, when, according to all known laws, it
should collapse.
I left good old “sticktion” alone for a day or
two, and then proceeded to get the wall back in
position with the aid of a bricklayer. We forced
it back temporarily with wooden struts, and next
drove metal wedges into the joints of the brick-
work by way of permanent support. A few yards
of cement and plaster completed the job, which,
being a bit unique, I contemplated with a certain
amount of pride. Of course, it was not altogether
satisfactory, as the cracks still came and went
according to the weather, and the bay window
continued to fall away from the house more or
less.
My architectural friends will doubtless suggest
that a new foundation should have been built
under the old one, and, of course, in that case the
bay window would have been Arm. But what
about the rest of the house, which had a bad foun-
dation throughout, and would no doubt have
fallen away from the bay window. Whether it is
more desirable to have a house which falls away
from a bay window, or a. bay window which falls
away from a house, is a question on which I was
never able to make up my mind, so the matter of
the new foundation has continued to stand over.
After all, our house had its good points. It
was, for instance, free from the new-fangled
notions which have sometimes proved so disas-
trous in the hands of Slumemup and his fellows.
Prominent among these are cavity walls, intended
to keep out the damp, but constructed in such a
manner as to conduct water to the interior by the
shortest possible route. Another builder’s notion
we escaped was a method much in vogue in our
locality—of so hipping the roof as to form a sort
of well or tank in the centre, the only “get away ”
for the water being by means of a pipe. Brown’s
house opposite was an example of this. And a
thunderstorm and a stoppage in the pipe having
happened along at the same time, Brown was
obliged to adjourn to the roof at the dead of night
and bale for all he was worth. A chance passer,
dimly discerning a man frantically throwing water
off a roof, could come to only one conclusion, and
being a Good Samaritan made a bee line for the
nearest alarm. The Petersham Brigade was
the first on the spot, although some thought
Newtown would have got “first water”; and
several large engines from Sydney thundered up.
Brown’s, address from the house-top .in. his
pyjamas, although hardly more lurid than the
occasion demanded, came to an abrupt termina-
tion, owing to a stream directed by an over-
particular fireman, who considered the air wanted
fumigating.
The excitement simmered down before day-
break, but not before letters had been posted to
several agents, notifying that another desirable
villa residence was on the market.
What is. a bay window with a tendency to
wander beside such an experience as Brown’s?

The Agent-General for South Australia recently
had a correspondence with the Admiralty (which
is a stertorous corporation with as much brains aa
the Australian Marine Board) on the subject of
supplies. The Admiralty replied that its present
service was efficient in all respects, and to that
Grainger replied that he could not understand
this statement, as the Admiralty had, only a few
days before, stated that it intended to reorganise
its supply service. The Admiralty had evidently
forgotten its own intentions. When Grainger
politely reminded the Lords of this he won a
promise that South Australia should be given
better opportunities for tendering in the future.
Yet, in the face of this benefit, the Adelaide
dailies censured Grainger in leading articles,
horror-stricken, that a common Agent-C eneral
should dare to argue with the “Noble Lords of
the Admiralty.” There are no such lick-spit tiers
in all England as the daily newspaper bosses oi
Australia.

Reception by the Lord Mayor of London of the
Waleses (ex the Yorks) brought out much greasv
gush. The little man delivered a speech which
was not a speech, but an “ Empire ” Magazine
article, smelling of the ink-pot, and writ in fair
Journalese. All the Imperial gushers in the city
concede the fact, in conversation, yet they beam
and say, “Ah, my dear chap ! —but how well he
memorised the speech. It was a kingly feat,

The bank frauds of Goudie, the ledger-keeper
of the Bank of Liverpool, show what slipshod
concerns for management and supervision many
of these banks are. The scheme was to forge
cheques in the name of big customers, whose
accounts were kept in Goudie’s ledger. The
cheques were paid and sent to Goudie to be
debited, and Goudie, instead of debiting, de-
stroyed them. Nobody checked Goudie’s ledger.
He had got into the Bank for £170,000, and might
have been at the game still but that one big cus-
tomer heard casually from a man, through whose
hands a forged cheque had passed, that he was
surprised at him drawing such a large open
cheque Then the big customer inquired, and as
the deoit couldn’t be found in Goudie’s ledger,
and the secret was blown.

The Freetrade crowd in Australia, the Aunt
Emma Pulsfords and the Mary Jane Goulds, who
continually point to the industrial conditions of
England as the right exemplar for Australian
legislation, should read the report of the Com-
mittee appointed by the Home Secretary of
England a few months ago to inquire into the
conditions of child labor. The report states
Of 585,000 children between the ages of 13 and 14, and
subject to the Education Acts, only 208,000 were shown
to be on the school registers. . . . Altogether it is
estimated that the number of children, within school-
attendance age, engaged in factories, workshops, mines,
shops, agriculture and selling in the streets is not less
than 300,000.
Fifteen thousand children are employed in various
works while attending school full time. This
does not include children employed as half-timers,
who, according to the Education Act returns for
1898, numbered 103,678 ; nor does it include chil-
dren employed, whether legally or not, as half
timers; 50,000 children are being worked more
than 20 hours a week, in addition to 27£ hours at
school, and of the number a considerable propor-
tion are being worked to 30, 40 and even to 50
hours a week (in addition to school hours). The
effect of this work is detrimental to their health,
their morals and their education, besides being
often so unremitting as to deprive them of
all reasonable opportunity for recreation. The
committee desires to extend to all occupations the
prohibition of employment between 9 p.m. and 6
a.m. . . . and thinks that it should be an offence,
punishable summarily, to cause a child to carry
heavy weights, or to employ it in any occupation
to an extent likely to be injurious to life, limb or
health, having regard to its physical and mental
conditions. In all attempts to give to the children
unemployed out of school hours physical recrea-
tion, the school-teachers are blocked by the ter-
rible poverty of the families. Says the report:
We have had as witnesses many excellent teachers who
organise games and teach the boys swimming, football,
cricket. But, as one of the teachers said, “ A child wear-
ing his father’s old boots is crippled, he can’t play.”
Imagine the joyless childhood in the Freetrade
Paradise where the majority of the people are en-
gaged in handling goods of the foreigner, and a
two days’ fog at the docks means a three days’
starvation to 200,000 people! t

Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are sold by all Chemists
and Storekeepers at 2s. 9d. per box (six boxes, 15s. 3d.), or
will be posted on receipt of price by Foster-McClellan Co.,
76 Pitt-street, Sydney.
The Testimony of Sydney People Stands the Test.
rrtHlj test of time is wliat tells- the tale. “ A new broom sweeps clean,” but
will it “ wear well ”is what interests most. The public soon find out when
misrepresentations are made, and merit alone will stand the test of time. Sydney
people appreciate merit, and many months ago local citizens publicly endorsed
Doais Backache Kidney Fills
They do so still. Would a citizen make the statement which follows unless con-
vinced that the article was just as represented ? A cure that lasts is the kind
that every sufferer from kidney ills is looking for.
FROM RANDWICK.
Mr. W. Hibberd, St. Paul’s-street, Rand wick, this city,
sa y S . “ p or years I have been a sufferer from backache. In
my work I have to stoop a good deal, and prolonged exertion
of this kind would double me up with pain. After stooping I
would be scarcely able to stand up straight again, but would
have to unbend gradually, and get the kinks out of my back.
I used many sorts of medicine for this ache, but with poor
success. The doctors I saw were also puzzled, I think. I
procured a box of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills at Newman’s
Pharmacy in King-street, and I am very pleased to tell you
that these pills gave me almost immediate relief. _ They went
right to the root of my trouble. The pains diminished after
further treatment, and at length totally disappeared. I shall
always recommend these pills for backache trouble.
Twelve months later Mrs. Hibberd states:— It is now
more than a year ago since my husband used Doan s Backache
Kidney Pills for backache. lam now enabled to say that the
pills wrought a permanent cure in his case. The pains never
returned since. I can speak with. conviction_ on the marvellous
way they acted in his case. He is very enthusiastic about the
mils and is always recommending them for such ailments as
the pills are meant for. He had been bad over ten years, so
you can see it is no common remedy that could cure lam the
way Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills did.
FROM BALMAIN.
Mr. P. Smith, No. 1 Cheltenham-street, Balmain, says:—
“ Over twelve months ago I used Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills for Kidney Trouble, and they worked a miracle in my
case. I had been under three doctors at different times, but
their treatment did me no good. I used to be so bad that I
would have to be carried home in a cart if an attack came on
me when working, or when in the street. Sometimes when
walking I have been taken bad, and would be taken to the
hospital. My wife said she never expected I would live
through some of these bad turns. I suffered with a kind of
biliousness, vomiting egg-like stuff. My secretions were in a
frightful state. I could never bend my back or move at all
. when I had a bad turn. The people at the hospital gave me
medicines and recommended rubbing in liniments, but it was
no use; they did me no good. I saw an advertisement for
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, stating that these pills had
cured Mr. Dunn, and knowing him led ine to procure this
remedy. I only took a short treatment, and they cured me.
The first dose relieved me. When I had finished them I
started work, and have worked ever since. It is heavy work
lam doing, but it does not affect me. These pills cured me
after years of suffering, and the relief was almost instan-
taneous. I might state that since then I had an attack of
lumbago, which laid me up one month, but I never thought
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were good for this complaint.
Then I remembered that I had a few in a box, and, not having
any other medicine in the house, I tried them. They cured me.’’
BUT BE SURE YOU GET DOAN’S.
Bridal Hymn.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Thine the hand that halved and fashioned
Into twain all things that be;
Thine the hand that, unimpassioned,
Halved the rebel Soul of me!
In thy court of Cloud-and-Shadow
Have I pleaded: “ Lord, how long ?
Give me sight of Eldorado,
Where she dwells, my Half-Soul strong ! ”
Grief mine heart hath made her dwelling,
Grief my guerdon gray and cold ;
While thy stern voice spake, foretelling,
Even so the Law must hold.
Even so shall half-souls, trailing
Draggled wings in slough of sin,
Walk apart, afar, bewailing,
For a white, unfound Soul-Twin.
Even so, who seeks shall find her,
He shall find her at the gate—
With a thousand links to bind her,
His foretold, predestined Mate.
And the Strong Man he shall take her,
Though the ways run red between;
He, the Rebel King, shall make her
His beloved Rebel Queen.
Queen of mine ! oh, dost thou listen ?
Let the weak ones wail and moan ;
Queen of mine ! thy fond eyes glisten
With a purpose like mine own.
Yea, and thus to-night I wed thee,
Lithe and supple, brave and tall,
Here on Nature’s couch to bed thee
With the clean skies over all,
On some throne of fern and clover,
At the birth-time of the morn,
So with clean skies arching over
May the Rebel Child be born !

The Burial of Bottler.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Some curious incidents happened in a slumberous
corner of the Land of Dreams in connection with
the demise of a person named Bottler.
Some time previous to his death, old Joe, the
Scrubber, who kept a second-hand emporium in
the township, held a clearing-out sale, and in-
cluded in the articles offered was a bush-hearse,
which looked something like a long-tom on
wheels. After an exciting contest it was knocked
down to Peter Boney, familiarly known as
Napoleon, the local butcher, who turned it into a
serviceable meat-cart after re-painting it a bright
green.
It had been the custom among the wealthier
citizens to be buried by an undertaker who
lived some twenty miles away, but at the time
of Mr. Bottler’s decease that person’s hearse
was undergoing repairs. Consequently it was
decided by the sorrowing relations to hire
Peter Boney’s ex-funeral chariot and convey
the coffin to the cemetery in secret, lest
the bright green vehicle should arouse derision
—also lest a prejudice should arise when
the cart went back to its usual occupation.
Arrangements having been made with parson
and sexton, the imposing cortege left Mr. Bottler’s
late residence at 1 a.m. on a beautiful summer’s
morn. The party consisted of Napoleon, who
sat on the front end of the hearse guiding the fiery
steed (which was named Blucher on account of his
mostly arriving with the orders too late for dinner),
and two chief mourners, who occupied the back
extremity with their feet hanging over the door.
There were no weepers or other funeral trappings.
It was two miles to the township from Bottler’s,
the cemetery being half-a-mile beyond. Unfor-
tunately, when they reached the main street the
wheels of the vehicle stuck in a treacherous bog-
hole, and, in spite of the strenuous exertions and
earnest prayers of the whole party, it was broad
daylight before the mournful procession landed
on sound going. The chief mourners were indig-
nant and grieved at the delay, and instructed
Napoleon to proceed at a less dignified pace.
Whereupon Boney roused Blucher with a
wattle sapling, and they rattled up the street at a
merry speed until they arrived opposite Ginn’s
Bull Hotel. There Blucher paused, and when
Boney banged him savagely on the ribs, he drew
close up against the front step and gazed sadly
backathismaster. Thechiefmournersalighted, and
endeavored to urge the animal forward, but with-
out success. The unseemly language of Napoleon
aroused Mr. Ginn, who thrust nis head out of a
top window, and remarked strongly on Boney’s
early call. He then ordered three pounds of
tripe, and retired.
At length, to the delight of the burial party,
Blucher condescended to move, but soon after
drew up at Mr. Ham’s grocery. Ham swore
violently at being disturbed at such an hour, and
ordered two pounds of sausages and a leg of
mutton “for the last time.”
Nothing would persuade Blucher to leave his
usual round and face the cemetery-road, and in
despair they continued their march round
the block, the inhabitants cursing Napoleon and
ordering joints alternately. Blucher called at
every house with painful regularity, and by the
time they began their second round the ladies
were stationed at the doors, armed with dishes
to receive their orders.
By this time the chief mourners had lost all hope,
and Napoleon was bathed in perspiration and rigid
with horror. Meanwhile, nothing could be more
dignified or calmer than the demeanor of Blucher,
unless it was the profound silence of Bottler.
And then, at the eleventh hour, Blucher repented
of his sins and agreed to start for the cemetery.
The people who had arisen prematurely from their
beds to take in the meat saw the butcher’s depar-
ture with indignation, and several of them fol-
lowed him with a view to demanding bone and
beef and satisfaction. Blucher presently repented
of having left the town, but, by dint of terrible
explosions of language and incessant bangs, they
persuaded him to keep on towards the burial-
place. When they arrived, the gates were closed,
the parson and sexton having gone home ; conse-
quently, they were overtaken and surrounded
by the crockery contingent, vehemently de-
manding its meat. One large female, who was
waiting for sheep’s head and fry, became so exas-
perated that she hurled an enormous dish at
Boney’s head. It missed the mark, and struck
Blucher on his tail-end. He gave the bottom of
the hearse one ferocious kick, and, taking control
of the funeral, left at a dangerous speed in a
north-easterly direction.
When they arrived at the next township Napo-
leon was something approaching a raving lunatic,
the chief mourners were in a state of collapse, and
Blucher was covered with lumps as big as pump-
kins. They were all arrested for furious driving
and fined half-a-sovereign and costs. The local
undertaker proceeded against Boney for practising
without a license, and got him fined thirty shil-
lings more. They didn’t take Bottler back, but
buried him in a strange town.
Boney, to appease his customers, sawed the
hearse in two. One-half of it he painted sky-blue,
and he turned the other into a dog-kennel.
C. H. READ.
A Study in Travellers.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
To the dwellers in the city and the Australian (?)
novelists, whose weird tales, “ racy of the soil,”
may be found in the pages of the monthly
magazines, the word swagman conveys nothing
more than an Australian version of the English
tramp or American Weary Willy. Even our own
Lawson, the recognised authority and biographer
of the guild, has hitherto confined himself to
pourtraying only one of the many distinct types
of travellers to be met with in the bush. The
Lawsonian traveller is a footman, a swagman pure
and simple, one who is content to carry the
“ parcel,” and does not aspire to the possession of
horses.
Of footmen there are two classes. First, the
non-horsey man, who has never ridden a horse,
and does not wish to learn how ; generally hail-
ing from outside Australia. Next, the man
who, through bad luck, or bad liquor, has, for
the time being, parted from his horses, but is
looking forward to being mounted in the near
future.
Of “bagmen,” the slang W. Queensland word
for mounted travellers, there are also several
grades. Of course, the “bagman” looks down
with a contemptuous pity on the footman, and this
is only natural. The sight of a footman with bluey
up, carrying a water-bag and billy-can in his hand,
and with a grey nose-bag, surrounded by a swarm
of flies, over his shoulder, is apt to reconcile the
“ bagman ” to his lot, although he may have empty
bags. Better to ride hungry than walk hungry.
If the mounted man does make a “ punch ” in the
tucker line he can carry it, whilst the swaggie has
to either sit down and eat it out or else leave it be-
hind. Whilst in a job the horseman is respected
more by his employer, though the footman may be
as good a workman.
The bagman will not foot it. Should he be re-
duced to parting with his horses by their death or
otherwise, he will raise at least one from friends
he knows, or, if necessary, from somebody he does
not know. But a horse he must and will have.
On the Barcoo, Peak Downs, or Warrego, the
one-horse man is occasionally met with. This
man packs all his rations in a split-bag, placed
across the seat of the saddle on which he sits.
The swag is in front, and with bell, hobbles, and
water-bag round the unfortunate crock’s neck,
he has got it all up. This man generally
wears long, bright “kidney-wipers,” with
bottom straps, as opposed to the genuine
horsey-man, whose spurs hang loose. Some-
times he carries a stockwhip coiled round his
shoulders, with fall and red-silk cracker complete,
and “ dog-stiffeners” as well. This individual is
a sheep-man, trying to look like a horsey-man,
probably a boundary-rider— a term of reproach
among stockmen, in fact a deadly insult. This
type is rarely met with west of Winton.
The next is the intermediate man, neither out-
backer nor “inside man.” He is met with about
Winton, Cloncurry, the Birdsville district, and
lower Georgina; sometimes a cattle man, some-
times a shearer, but always a horsey-man, and
with never less than two horses. More often than
not he is the possessor of a “bit of a cutter,”
which, in his opinion, is “red hot” for a quai'-
ter or perhaps 6 furlongs. When full of liquor,
he defies the district to produce the equal of
this horse, but generally backs down if met with
a good strong bluff of “ money up.”
The out-backer proper comes last. His re-
gion is the country west of Camooweal, on
the Georgina, the Tablelands of the N. Terri-
tory, and the Gulf proper ( not the “Gulf”
above Normanton meat-works), anywhere west
of Turn-off Lagoon, and thence right to W. A. He
generally, unless a digger, follows stock-
anging, either on the road or stations.
He is always well horsed, and carries a good
outfit all complete, from shoeing-tackle to gun,
rifle, and revolver. His horses number anything
from three to half-a-dozen, and often he has his
black boy or gin to look after them. These men
take pride both in their horses and themselves,
and nearly always have a pound or two for tucker,
rarely coming down to asking for rations. West
of the Georgina most men know one another, and
mateship is more existent than in the settled dis-
tricts. Hence, a man can nearly always borrow
a pound or so till things come round. Also, he
can in this part safely leave his camp without fear
of being robbed by his fellows, a thing which
would very probably happen further inside where
the city-bushmen lurk.
Of Territory men there are several sorts, from
the Line man to the Macarthur man, Kimberley*
digger and . Port Darwin buffalo-shooter, all pos-
sessing various distinguishing marks only visible
to the initiated. They possess also many harmless
vanities, such as going shirtless in summer, or
wearing their shirts outside their trousers like the
lubra, who never wears her shirt tucked into her
trousers.
But civilisation is advancing. The bike and the
motor-car threaten the bagman. May his day of
doom be long in coming, for with him will disap-
pear a manly type,, self-reliant and honorable,
with a firm belief in himself as an Australian.
These on the one side of the scale ; on the other—
perhaps given to liquor, and somewhat foul-
mouthed, but his hard life is not calculated to
foster the graceful viitues.
C. BORROLOOLA.
A voice from the Islands :
If the New Hebrides cast off Australia it will be largely
because of the disgust the native men have for the Mel-
bourne and Sydney traders’ style of paying for yams and
taro. Jews’ harps constitue the bulk of the trade, and
the woman force the men to accept these toys. Then
when the women get the instruments they sit and play
all day. “ Mary play Jews’ harp all a time,” is the groan
of the male native from shore to shore.
