Christmas Numbers .
The cult of Christmas Numbers grows ;
and. with reason. Marvels are staled for
moderners; but any mind which can for a
moment leave the nil admirari rut, look
back ten yeans, and see what additional
captives in literature, art, and mechanical
science the conquering Christmas Number
has bound to its triumphal car, even in that
brief time, can hardly fail of astonishment.
It is not enough to say that the shillings-
worth now given is equal to the three or four
shillings worth of a few years ago. The point
is that a few years ago—a very few years
ago—nowadays achievements would hardly
have been possible at any price. The im-
provement in printing machinery, and
especially in machinery for printing in color
—this it chiefly is that propels the Christ-
mas Number forward.
Doubtless the Christmas Number is open
to criticism. Its literary and artistic themes
are generally conventional, and their treat-
ment is frequently tawdry. The purchasing
public’s demand for gaudy coloring provokes
monstrosities which scare an artist. Year
by year recur the young Millaisian female in
a red cloak, or a blue cloak, or with slightly
altered headgear ; the trite peace-and-good-
will homilies; the twaddling seasonable tales,
bestuck with ghosts and mistletoe, that
gladden the heart of the British Philistine.
But discount the Christmas Number as you
will, there remains a substantial balance to
its credit. It disseminates a wonderful
amount of decent literature for its price, and
a very reasonable quantity of art. It is not
all Philistinish, and if it were it would not
be wholly to blame. For mark this : whilst
the neurotic Bohemian refines gross spirits,
it is the Philistine who provides the race
with healthy bodies.
“Jin’yus! Jin’yus!
Tak’ care o’ your carkus !”
is the vital maxim which the Philistine con-
sistently enforces. Give him credit for his
most essential r6le in the world’s drama.
Man does not live by bread alone—but he
wants it with his wine. And, in effect, who
drives the engine if it isn’t the stoker ?
The most striking feature among the half-
dozen Christmas Numbers to hand by last
mail comes with the Lady’s Pictorial (Is.
10d.). It is a single female figure—single
female figures, for a variety of reasons, make
nearly always the most effective supplements
—reproduced from a painting by N. Sichel.
The title is “ Day-Dreams,” but as the semi-
Spanish face is almost expressionless, it
might as well have been anything else. The
pose and coloring, however, are good ; the
background is well contrasted ; and the
“depths” lacking in the picture may be
safely left (according to Bernard Shaw’s mot )
to the male imagination. The tales in the
Lady’s Pictorial are of no particular merit.
Perhaps the best number, from a literary
point of view (as well as artistic), is Black
and White (Is. 4d.) to which Anthony Hope
andotherscontribute. The Graphic (Is lOd),
however, has a striking story by Rudyard
Kipling, “The Devil and the Deep Sea,”
full of vivid force. Kipling’s method, now
that he has pretty well exhausted his Indian
and familiar material, is simple enough.
He studies the technique of a scene, or a
class, or a profession, as if he had to pass an
examination, links a striking phase with
striking argot, and makes a striking tale.
Simple though the plan be, it is one that for
most writers would result in dullness and
incoherency. The essence of its success is
still Kipling’s brilliant talent.
Holly Leaves (Is lOd) is this year a weak
number, playing very low down to the
comprehension of the sporting gent. The
Illustrated London News (Is 4cf) also fails.
It consists of two tales—one (unfinished) by
the late R. L. Stevenson ; the other by the
newly-knighted Besant. Both are exceed-
ingly dull. It is (or isn’t, on second thoughts)
wonderful what reverence British publishers
and the British public pay to great names,
even when the wits have departed.
Yule Tide (Is. lOd.) is fortunate in a very
good Cornish story by “Q.,” in which this
haunting love-song oceurs :
Long before day I left my‘father’s cottage,
I went by the tamarisks upon the hedges of the
sea,
Seeking my lovely one, my comforter, before the
morning.
My brothers three lie drowned by Dolor Ogo :
They call in the night, “ Little sister, when is the
wedding ?
It is cold waiting, and thou a drudge in our father’s
cottage.”
Now must I go and whisper them “Not yet.”
Not yet; but the thyme of the hedge kisses my
naked foot —
So will he kiss me soon and comfort me, my pretty
lover.
Then will I kneel by him, and he shall bandage
The wounds of the brambles, and I, kneeling
beside him,
Sweetly, my arms holding his waist, will kiss
him—ah when ?
If this is invented it is uncommonly well
invented : probably it is adapted from some
half-forgotten folk-song.
Single copies of the above will be posted
at prices quoted from The Bulletin Book
Exchange : Gordon and Gotch are whole-
sale agents.
Recent Publications.
“In the Early Days,” by J. J. Knight
(Sapsford and Co., 10s. Bd.), is a reprint of a
number of articles dealing with the history
of Moreton Bay settlement before the separa-
tion of Queensland from New South Wales.
These were originally contributed to Bris-
bane Courier by the author, a member of
the Courier staff, and they do his energy
and industry very great credit. The subject-
matter is of considerable local and antiquarian
interest; and Mr. Knight has collected and
collated much valuable historical informa-
tion which but for him, it is to be feared,
would soon have been forgotten. His book has
no definite literary value, and necessarily ap-
peals to but a limited circle of readers ; but in
the sphere of the compiler—the only one which
Mr. Knight claims to move in—he deserves
praise for executing a work o£ undoubted
public value, which few public writers would
have the courage to attempt.
“ Mona Marie ” is a Ballarat (Vic.) maker
of verse of which she forwards samples to
The Bulletin, The writer appears to
belong to the formidable class who drivel
daily rhymes over every melancholy subject
from the death of Gordon to that of Mrs.
Blank’s ’possum. A sample :
Speak not, ye Britons, now’s the time,
Your right as freemen claim ;
Denounce the present Cabinet
In martyr’d Gordon’s name— &o.
Another :
But, ah! beneath this flower-decked mound they’d
laid their dearest pet,
A tame opposum (sic), mourned for now by them
with real regret,
This morning it has been so strange, they called—
it heeded not—
It had not power to run to them or leave yon
shaded spot— ad lib.
The author communicates the astounding
information that 3200 copies of the books
containing this slush have been sold about
Ballarat. 3200 copies !—can Kendall, for
one, count so many ? It is an unkind thing
to say, but if Ballarat buys “ Mona Marie’s”
verse, probably it is because Ballarat de-
serves to.
Methuen and Co. send copies of Kipling’s
“ Barrack-room Ballads ” and George’s
“Battles of English History,” already
noticed as valuable additions to their colonial
library (3s. and 4s. each). Kipling’s fame is
now commensurate with the language ; and
George gives very pithy, readable comments
on a fascinating subject.
Gordon and Gotch issue in “Our Cels--
brities ” (Is. 2d.) a series of portraits of
Hilda Spong, Mr. and Mrs. Brough, Dion
Boucicault, Miss Biilee Barlow, Pattie
Brown, Titheradge, Kowalski, Nellie
Stewart, Sarah Bernhardt and Mrs. Brown-
Potter, Grice Palotta, Melba, Maud Wil-
liamson, Olga Nethersole, Louis Bradfield,
Mark Twain, Mark Hambourg, Miss
Florence, Maud Hobson, Maud Fitz-Stubbs,
Blanche Massey, Mrs. Morris (of Melb.)
and Miss Maud Roberts (of Sydney)—24 in
all. The photos, were specially produced by
the Falk Studios, and several of them are
artistic gems. The reproduction has been,
in most cases, well done, and the album is
from many points of view the best of its
kind yet published in Australia.
NOTES.
The account of an interview with the
Devil in that strong collection of short
stories, “ Aut Diabolus Aut Nihil,” recently
published in cheaper form by Methuen (35.,
45.) is one of the most remarkable passages
in modern fiction—though, indeed, the
narrative professes to be fact, and there is a
quite respectable society of devil-worshippers
in Paris to authenticate the incident. A
certain popular Parisian Abbd is led to
"entrust himself to a devil-worshipper who
lakes him by devious ways to a mysterious
hall, where a number of men prostrate
themselves with many invocations. Sud-
denly His Royal Darkness appears ;
He was a young man of apparently twenty, tall,
as beardless as the young Augustus, with bright
golden hair falling from his forehead like a girl’s.
He was dressed in evening dress, and his cheeks
w r ere flushed as if with wine or pleasure ; but from
his eyes there gleamed a look of inexpressible sad-
ness, of intense despair.
The group of men had evidently become aware
of his presence at the same moment, for they all
fell prone upon the floor adoring, and their words
were now' no longer words of invocation, but
words of praise and worship.
The Abbe was frozen with horror: there wars no
room in his breast for the lesser emotion of fear;
indeed, the horror was so great and all-absorbing
as to charm him and hold him spell-bound.
He could not remove his eyes from the
Thirteenth, who stood before him calmly, a faint
smile playing over his intellectual and aristocratic
face —a smile which only added to the intensity of
the despair gleaming in his clear blue eyes. Girod
was struck first with the sadness, then with the
beauty, and then with the intellectual vigor, of
that marvellous countenance.
The expression was not unkind or even oold ;
haughtiness and pride might indeed be read in
the high-bred features, shell-like sensitive nostrils,
and short upper-lip; while the exquisite sym-
metry ailfl perfect proportions of his figure showed
suppleness and steel-like strength ; for the rest,
the face betokened, save for the flush upon the
cheeks, only great sadness.
The eyes were fixed upon those of Girod, and he
felt their soft, subtle, intense light penetrate into
every nook and cranny of his soul and being.
This terrible Thirteenth simply stood and gazed
upon the priest, as the worshippers grew more
wild, more blasphemous, more cruel.
The Abbe could think of nothing but the face
before him, and the great desolation that lay folded
°y® r h; as a veil. He could think of no prayer,
although he could remember there were prayers.
. Was this Despair—the Despair of a man drown-
mg in sight of land —being shed into him from the
sad blue eyes ? Was it Despair or was it Death ?
Ah, no, not Death! —Death was peaceful, and
this was violent and passionate.
Was there no refuge, no mercy, no salvation
anywhere ? Perhaps, nay, surely, but while those
sad blue eyes still gazed upon him, the sadness, as
it seemed to him, intensifying every moment, he
could not remember where to seek for and where
to find such refuge, such mercy, such salvation.
He could not remember, and yet he could not
entirely forget. He felt that help would come to
him if he sought it, and yet he could hardly tell
how to seek it.
Moreover, by degrees the blue eyes—it seemed
as if their color, their great blueness, had some
fearful power—began pouring into him some more
hideous pleasure. It was the ecstasy of great pain
becoming a delight, the ecstasy of being beyond
all hope, and being thus enabled to look with
scorn upon the Author of hope. And all the
while the blue eyes still gazed sadly, with a soft
smile breathing overwhelming despair upon him,
Girod knew that in another moment he would
not sink, faint, or fall, but that he would—oh !
much worse ! —he would smile!
At this very instant a name—a familiar name,
and one which the infernal worshippers had made
frequent use of, but which he had never remarked
before—struck his ear : the name of Christ,
Where had he heard it ? He could not tell. It
was the name of a young man ; he could remember
that and nothing more.
Again the name sounded, “ Christ.”
There was another word like Christ, which
seemed at some time to have brought an idea first
of great suffering and then of great peace.
Ay, peace, but not pleasure. No delight like
this shed from those marvellous blue eyes.
Again the name sounded, “ Christ.”
Ah ! the other word was cross—croix —he re-
membered now; a long thing with a short thing
across it.
Was it that as he thought of these things the
charm of the blue eyes and their great sadness
lessened in intensity ? We dare not say; but as
some faint conception of what a cross was flitted
through the Abba’s brain, although he could think
of no prayer-nay, of no distinct use of this cross
—he drew his right hand slowly up, for it was
pinioned as by paralysis to his side, and feebly
and half mechanically made the sign across his
breast.
The vision vanished.
. Under the title of “They Also Serve”
a fine poem was read before the U.S.
Army of the Potomac at its 20th annual re-
union on 18th June last. The author is H.
C. Banner, editor of Puck, and the poem is
printed in Scribner’s for November (Is. 2d.,
14s. per annum). An eloquent passage :
What does the boy do who goes to bed
In the great third year of the war,
With the farm-house roof hanging low overhead
And the path of the moon stretching out before,
Out over the road and over the lake
To the dusty highway the soldiers take
When they march on their way to the South ?
What does he do when he goes to bed ?
He lays on the pillow a tousled head,
And the tired eyelids that all the day
Have been with the face of the world at play;
Watching the birds and the swing of the trees,
Watching the chipmunks more quick than the
breeze,
V, 7 atching the melons a-taking on green,
Watching the myriad things to be seen—
They close for a moment and open again,
For he hears the tramp of the marching men
Southward and ever south ;
And he swallows a sob and shuts tight his mouth
And orders his heart to the right-about,
But even in slumber his tears slip out
That the sound of the drum and the fife
Is slipping away to the strife,
Where he may not go
Till sun and snow
Have carried his eager young spirit, say,
A couple of years on its patriot way.
Oh, how he yearns for it,
How his heart burns for it —
How the shrill music of drum and of fife
Thrills through the whole of him,
Wakes the young soul of him—
Oh, to be with them and pay with his life !
What does the boy do who goes to bed
In the great, third year of the war ?
Wakes in the morn when the east is red
Ai d the west is silvered o’er ;
Wakes in the morning and goes to work
Eating his heart but too proud to shirk,
Dropping the corn in the heart of the hill,
Plying his spade and his hoe with a will;
And his mother looks fron?the kitchen stoop,
With reddened eyelids»that quiver and droop,
At the one boy left her —oh, friends in blue—
Wasn’t he fighting as well as you?

Dr. GIBBONS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London!
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS Sc SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their,
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He,
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely ; —Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, fa c.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt op 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,

restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.

your case requires ad vice, and you can either call

in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
DR. GIBBONS

opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send 6d. in

The word is suggestive. Many dealers keep their
customers very much in the dark as to the true
state of tilings. So to apeak, they get behind their
pwn blindk because the oircmnstancea won’t allow
them to'emorge into the full light.
OUR REPRESENTATIVE IN CHINA
writes as follows :
I should like to mention certain matters In connection))
with the blind trade. With every order I place 1 INSIST
ON INSPECTION before packing, with the result that
not less than 25 to'3o per cent, are rejected. But I find,
this season a firm has placed large orders, but ABSO-'
LUTEIiY, NO INSPECTION takes place, consequently
makers /y a!re competing for the orders at lower rates on j
these terms.
We take-our friends behind th’e scenes so that
they may see WHAT A TRAGEDY the blind
trade is t and so that they may, when buying blinds,
discriminate between honest dealers and the other
sort. No doubt the blinds WHICH ARE
SHIPPED WITHOUT INSPECTION are,
offered at lower prices thanSELEOTED BLINDS,
but wise people wall prefer giving a trifle more,
should it be necessary, with the certainty of get-
ting BLINDS which offer some show of protec-
tion, and that do not tumble in pieces after a
fortnight’s wear.
BAMBOO BLINDS
made of the outside of skin or- the bamboo in
its natural color, SPECIALLY SELECTED.
Fitted with CORDS and pulleys ready to put up.
It may be added that the CORDS are strong and
suitable, and' not liable to rot and break on the
least provocation. Sizes from '3ft. wide by 6ft.
deep to 12ft. wide by Bft. deep; prices, Is. to
ss. 6d. each blind.
CHINESE BLINDS
made of fine split bamboo, painted green on both
sides, and fitted with CORDS and pulleys of
best quality. These blinds are SPECIALLY
SELECTED. Sizes from 3ft. wide by 6ft. deep
to 12ft. wide by 10ft. deep ; prices from Is. Bd. to
7s. 6d. each blind.
BEAD And REED BLINDS.
Charming assortment of colors and styles. These
blinds are available for halls., doorways and win-
dows. They say they frighten the flies away. If
so, they are worth a pound an inch. Prices from
2s. 9d. to 15s.

WHAT CURES PIMPLES
A marvellous b.eautifier of world-wide celebrity, Cuticura Soap is simply incom-
parable as a Skin-Purifying Soap, unequalled for the Toilet, and without a rival for
the Nursery. Absolutely pure, delicately medicated, exquisitely perfumed, it produces
the whitest, clearest skin, and softest hands, and prevents inflammation and clogging
of the pores, the cause of pimples, blotches, blackheads, red and oily skin, and most
complexional disfigurations. It derives its remarkable medicinal properties from
Cuticura, the great skin cure, but so delicately are they blended with the purest of
toilet and nursery soap stocks that thohesult is a medicated toilet soap incomparably
superior to ah other skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and sur-
passing in purity the most noted'and expensive of toilet and nursery soaps. For the
prevention of facial blemishes, for giving a brilliancy and freshness to the com-
plexion, and for cleansing the scalp and invigorating the hair,j it is without a peer.
Sale greater than the combined sales of all other skin soaps. Sold everywhere. 25c.

ive arid care of pimples, blotches,

TO OUR BARDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, Australian poets despairing,
Why is ever your singing so sad ?
Have you never a story of daring?
Have you never a note that is glad ?
Do you wail for the few perchance dying
By the fever, or flood, of the black ?
These are merely the chips that go flying
From a station in clearing its track.
We, who stand in the gates of the morning,
We, the foam on the crest of Life’s wave,
To your tales hearken only with scorning
Of lost laves and dead men and a,gfave.
For we hear, like our fathers before us,
. The same siren and wonderful song,
Of the gold in fresh lands with its ohorus,
“The wide earth and her fruits for the strong. ”
Let your verse tell of manhood’s endeavour
" Of the rapture of life and life’s toil;
Make it echo the full-flooded river,
Let it smell of the newly-turned soil.
We should hear in the ring of its cadence
The loud thunder of hoofs on the plain,
Or in rhythmical beat the colt’s galloping feet
As he reefs at his bit for the rein.
Or the crash of the red cedar falling
Far away in the scrubs of the north,
Or the voice of the desert-sphinx calling
To the men of her qhoosing, “ Oome forth ! ”
Ever bright is our sun. It should glisten
As through leaves in the warp of each line,
For a bugle to battle we listen;
For a thought that will stir us like wine.
Are you blind to the rainbow o’er-arching
Shining years on a young People’s way,
Deaf to Democrat multitudes marching
From the darkness out into the day ?
See you not a great nation Australian
Girt by summer-lit seas free from wars,
Fretffrom priestcraft and statecraft and alien.
And content ’neath her bright Southern stars?
Q.
R.A.E.
THE OLD PIT-SAW.
There’s a melody heard in the lonely bush
Like the haunting strains of a phantom call,
Or the sweeping song of the water’s rush
As it springs from the edge of a waterfall.
To take_a view from the clear uplands
Of the glistening bush, it always seems
A picture drawn by master hands
From mirror’d thoughts of ideal dreams.
I love the song that the pit-saw sings ;
Its, music, set to a muffled key,
A flood of tender memories brings
Of the roaring days that used to be.
'Tis/brawny arms, with a glittering blade,
i That sing the song in the downward blow ;
..And many the echoes the pit-saw made
In tangled scrubs where the cedars grow ;
Where the changing streams of listless winds
Whirl and sweep in a softening sigh,
Whispering love to the swinging vines
That hang from the tops of brushwoods high ;
And the waving trees, and the vines that cling
From drooping limbs, in the sunlight show
A glitter of pearls on the leaves that sing
A lullaby to the brush below>
But the sawyer’s trade is failing fast,
The sweet scrub’s stillness is rarely stirred ;
Where all was life in the busy past
The transom now is never heard.
The timber-slide with its chain-bound load
The teamster now will seldom haul ;
On the winding track that made his road
The undergrowth is thick and tall.
The glorious past! ’Tis a bird that’s flown
On Time’s impetuous wings ;
Yet we have lived'!x The past’s our own !
Who cares what the future brings !
THE SNAS.
A PROTEST.
We are sorry with his bereaved and sorrowing family ;
but as neither lamentations nor regrets will turii'the arch-
fiend one hairsbread,th from his nefarious course, we must
bend our necks to the yoke and return to the worries and
recreations of life.— N.S. W. Country er.
’Tis sad to know that 1 must die,
But sadder still, by far, ''
To feel that I’ll be followed by
The obituary par—
That corpse-reviving par.
Some way-back scribe will scratch his head
And rack brain,
In vain attempts to say I’m dead
In language not too plain—
The par. must not be plain.
I wonder will he sadly state
“He’s gone to realms of light,”
Or, in a sporting vein, relate —
“ He passed the judge last night ”
Weighed in correct last night.
“ The spectre on the uld white horse ”
He’s kept in type for years,
With “he who reaps without remorse
His harvest sown with tears ”
The bush-scribe’s inky tears.
I’d much prefer “ He’d passed away ”
To “shed this mortal coil,”
And double rates I’d gladly pay
For “gathered to the soil”—
Just dumped beneath the soil.
Oh 1 bless the scribe who cuts it short,
But blight with sharp remorse
The fiend who hints I fell athwart
“ Old Nick’s nefarious course ”
His wild, hilarious course.

Adopted by DIXSON& SONS.for their
HighestCrade.Mild Plug Tobacco.
YANKEE * DOODLE .
“YANKEE DOODLE” is everywhere spoken of as the finest plug-tobacco that has ever
appeared here, and it lias won greater success during the short time it has been on the market than
anything previously. This is no idle boast, and, to prove it, any smoker can test the statement, for
there are few towns in N.S.W. where “YANKEE DOODLE” is not known and sold. Its sale
has this year increased nearly one hundred (100) per cent over that of last year. And why is this?
Simply that “YANKEE DOODLE ” has struck the popular taste. In the first place, it comes, after
years of careful study, from a combination of certain choice Virginian tobaccos, so blended and
exquisitely flavoured, that any smoker who can stand a tobacco heavier than the pure gold-leaf is
forced to admit that he has at last discovered something far and away better than anything he has
been accustomed to. DIXSON & SONS have taken over half-a-century to accomplish this; and, as
their leading business has been built up on their reputation for QUALITY, they could not afford to
make the foregoing statement if any doubt existed. DIXSON & SONS, who use more American leaf
than all the other Tobacco Factories combined, are noted for several high-class brands:—“CON-
QUEROR,” “SIR ROGER,” “CHAMPION,” and “DOLLAR-.” but “YANKEE DOODLE’
ranks supreme.

SATURDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1893.
The Land-Tax Compromise.
The combustible Premier of New South
Wales long ago backed-down on his over-
confident promises to promptly reform the
Upper House, and bring it in line with
popular sentiment, and make it accept the
Land and Income-tax scheme, as approved
by the Peoples Chamber, hi its entirety.
Also the glowing assurance that the Govern-
raent would stand by every letter and line of
the exemption clauses, in particular, has
dropped out of sight and been wholly for-
gotten The Council remains unreformed,
and the Bill providing for its reformation
was ignominiously thrown out, and the
ancient nominees hacked, and altered, and
amended the Land and Income-tax scheme,
am! cut out all its most valuable principles,
ana rebuilt it on strict Tory lines, until it
became almost unrecognisable. Then repre-
sentatives of the two Houses sat in solemn
conference over the differences of opinion,
and with the direct consent and assistance of
1 remier Reid a compromise has been
arrived at, in which the Council gains much
and the People s Chamber very little. If
the Land and Income-tax, as amended by
the conference, becomes law, it will be a
little better than nothing, inasmuch as it
asserts a principle, but that is all that can be
said for it. Considering the time and labor,
and political agitation and bombast, and
empty promises expended upon it, it amounts
to veiy little indeed.
** * ,
The most notable alteration is the reduc-
tion of the Land-tax exemption from £475,
as proposed in the Assembly’s Bill, to £240.
This is a great and distinct gain to Coiiser-
vatism, and The Bulletin would have pre-
ferred, in the interests of the Democracy, to
see tbe exemption raised to, say, £5OO. The
Conservative idea of a land-tax is that it
should be a measure for raising revenue
only ; that it should press quite as
heavily on the small farmer with a few
scanty acres as on the mammoth land-
grabber who blocks settlement over half a
county ; and that it should eslablisli no
obstacle to the creation of the big estates
which the soul of Fat Man loveth. The
Democratic idea is that it should be only
incidentally a revenue-raising device. Its
great object should be to encourage the dis-
tribution of land in small estates, each occu-
pied and worked by its owner, and to dis-
courage the accumulation of huge properties
and the system of letting-out to tenants, and
the consequent division of the community, in
course of time, into an opulent squirearchy,
and below it a race of tenant-farmers who
grovel to the landowner lest the rent should
be raised, and light bonfires in the true
British spirit when the heir comes of age,
and below that again a hard-driven, under-
paid peasantry who work for and grovel to
both classes alike. The only way to do this
by means of a land-tax is to exempt the man
who owns just sufficient land for the com-
fortable support of himself and his family ;
to tax the man who owns land beyond
that limit on a steadily-increasing ratio
according to the extent of his property ;
to tax the large landlord who lets his pro-
perty, and lives on the rents on a higher
scale than the one who cultivates his own big
holding ; and to tax on an exceptionally high
scale the absentee who adds to his iniquities
by spending his rents abroad, instead of cir-
culating them in the countxy whence they
are derived.
# * #
By this system absenteeism would be made
unprofitable, and would gradually die out in
consequence. The accumulation of very
large estates would also be made unprofit-
able ; there would be a constant tendency to
subdivision, and as the tax would grow
steadily lighter as the subdividing process
went on, the inevitable tendency would be
to come down to the exemption limit at
which it ceased altogether. Assuming land
to have an all-round value of £1 per acre,
and to yield 5 per cent, on its value, a tax of
2d. in the £ on the largest estates would
reduce their value to 16s. Bd. per acre. Yet
when that large estate was subdivided into
small properties, each below the taxable
limit, it would again become worth £1 per
acre ; therefore, there would be a most
powerful reason why the accumulation of
large estates should come to a sudden stop-
page. As the absentee tax has been aban-
doned, the graduated principle altogether
omitted, and the exemption reduced so low
that a property small enough to escape taxa-
tion would, in almost every case, be too small
for the comfortable maintenance of the
owner and his family, whatever tendency the
measure might have had to discourage the
big land-grabber has mostly disappeared. It
will still have some slight influence in that
direction, but not nearly so much as it
should have had if built on really Democratic
principles. < ;i
* • *
The income-tax exemption has also been
reduced from £3OO to £2OO, and by these
alterations the Council wreaks a picturesque
vengeance on a good many of its enemies.
The two reductions will bring both taxes
home to some thousands of people who voted
for them under the impression that they
would apply only to the other man. And in
the ordinary course of human nature this
means that a good many thousand voters will
be prepared at the next opportunity to vote
for the abolition of both taxes, or for the
further reduction of the exemptions. Almost
everybody wants to see the man who put a
special tax upon him made to share that tax
himself, therefore the wider the application
of the impost the more people there will be
to vote for making it wider still, and every
extension of it decreases the Fat Man’s
special disability. If the members of the
Council do not see and fully appreciate this
circumstance then their usual astuteness has
somehow deserted them.
* * #
The absentee-tax, as already mentioned,
was struck out by the Council, and the Reid
Government has assented to its excision.
The clause whereby the State had power, in
serious cases of under-valuation, to resume
the land at 10 per cent, over the
owner’s value, was also excised. A
much-needed clause providing that, when
land was wanted for railways or
other public purposes, it should be re-
sumed at, say, 10 per cent, over the land-
tax valuation, never got into the Bill at all.
Therefore, the unspeakable land-resumption
swindle will progress as usual, and the
country will probably see the astounding
spectacle of an estate being taxed at £lOOO
under strong protest from the owner against
the excessive character of the valuation, and
yet resumed at £3OOO when it is wanted for
public purposes, after a bitter lawsuit insti-
tuted with a view to recovering twice that
amount. The Bill exempts the English or
other foreign holder of N.S.W. State securi-
ties, but no provision for exempting the
local one has been inserted ! The maximum
penalty for breaches of the Act has been
reduced from £5O to £2O, so that the wealthy
citizen may falsify his returns at less risk
than was originally intended. Also, no
absentee income-tax has been attempted,
and in all these respects Fat Man has come
off remarkably well, every notable omission
or alteration being largely in his favor.
* # •
The most astounding concession, how-
ever, has been in the matter of mort-
gages. In the original Bill it was pro-
vided that the interests of the mortgagor
and the mortgagee should be taxed on the
same scale ; in other words, where a pro-
perty was valued at £lOO,OOO and was mort-
gaged for £50,000, the nominal owner should
pay one-half the tax, and the mortgagee the
other half. This was altered by the Council
to read that the nominal owner should pay
land-tax on £50,000 and the mortgagee should
pay income-tax on the revenue derived from
his mortgage. With the land-tax at the
proposed rate of Id. in the £ of capital value,
and the income-tax at 6d. in the £ of in-
come, this meant that the nominal owner
would pay £207 6s. Bd. on his half in-
terest, after deducting the £240 exemption,
while the holder of a 5 per cent, mortgage
would pay only £62 10s. on the other half.
Therefore, it followed that the man who
owned £lOO,OOO worth of land, and was
liable for an annual land-tax of £415135. 4d.,
could, by transferring the property to his
brother Bill, and securing himself with a
mortgage for £90,000 at 5 per cent., x'e-
duce his payments to the State to £4O 13s. 4d.
land-tax and £ll2 10s. income-tax, making
a total of £153 3s. 4d. This simple and
obvious device would save him £262 10s.
annually, and plunder the State to that ex-
tent ; and, as almost every Fat Man whose
land-tax liability was large enough to make
it worth while creating a bogus mortgage
would do so, the result would be that the
heaviest proportion of the tax would fall on
the small estates while large ones got off
with half, or less than half, their fair propor-
tion. This arrangement was so obviously
one-sided and fraudulent that the conference
speedily abandoned it, and in its stead fixed
up one which, apart from the fact that it
did not offer the same facilities for robbing
the Treasury, was several degrees worse.
* * #
The text of the new clause dealing with
mortgages runs thus ;
That, in the case of mortffarfed land, Land-tax shall be
payable by the mortKagor, who shall be entitled to an
abatement from such Land-tax equal to the amount of
Income-tax which would be payable on the yearly interest
accruing from the mortgage, irrespective of Income-tax
exemptions.
This clause is presumably built according to
the ordinary rules of the Australian lan-
guage, and means exactly what it says, and,
in that case, the result will be as follows :
The man who owns £lO,OOO worth of unim-
proved land entirely free from mortgage will
pay £4O 13s. 4d., being Id. in the £ on his
interest in the property. The man who
holds a similar area of land with a £5OOO
liability upon it at 5 per cent, will pay £4O
13s. 4d., less £6 ss. chargeable as income-
tax to the mortgagee, so that his net liability
will be £34 Bs. 4c1., or nearly l|d. in the £
on his interest. The man similarly situated,
with a mortgage of £9OOO at 5 per cent, on
his property, will pay £4O 13s. 4d., less £ll
ss. chargeable to the mortgagee, so that his
liability will be £29 Bs. 4d., or over seven-
pence in the £ on his interest in the property.
If the mortgage carries interest at 10 per
cent., the mortgagee will still only pay £22
10s. on his interest in the property, said
interest amounting to £9OOO, while the
nominal owner pays £lB 3s. 4d. per annum
on £lOOO of property—equal to nearly 4jd.
in the £. The result of this lamentable pro-
posal, if the above clause means what it says,
is that the more embarrassed the landholder
is the more heavily he is taxed, and if he is
very heavily embarrassed the tax will fall
on him with crushing v/eight.
* * #
This is one side of the clumsy and hap-
hazard arrangement—the one which applies
especially to unimproved, or comparatively
unimproved, properties. But there is
another aspect of the case equally
ridiculous. The land - tax applies to
unimproved values only. The mortgage
covers both the unimproved value and the
improvements, when there are any, and,
according to the wording of the clause, the
income-tax on the whole mortgage is to be
deducted, no matter how large this discrep-
ancy may be. In the case of a £lO,OOO pro-
perty, of which £2OOO represents the unim-
proved value, and £BOOO the improvements,
the land-tax at Id. in the £ on £2OOO would
be £7 6s. Bd. And if the property was
burdened with a £6OOO mortgage at 8 per
cent, the mortgagee’s share of the above-
mentioned £7 6s. Bcl. would be £l2, so that
the owner under these conditions would pay
no land-tax at all—in fact, someone would
owe him £4 13s. 4d. These results supply
a tine example of the great art and mystery
of shovelling a Bill together and letting
things take their chance.

The Land and Income Tax Bill, as
amended and compromised upon by the con-
ference of the two Houses, has hardly one
merit save that it is a machine for grinding,
out revenue. It does nothing to discourage
the absentee curse ; in fact, in one matter—
that of State securities—it exempts the
absentee while taxing the local investor. It
does as little as it possibly can to obstruct
the accumulation of big estates, and its
abilities in the direction of leaving this evil
alone are truly remarkable. It bears lightly
on the rich man whose estate is un-‘
encumbered, and comes down heavily
on the poor man whose property is
in pawn to the rich one. And even
the fact that it will yield revenue is of
comparatively small account, as the revenue
it yields is not to be employed in public
works, or in reduction of the public debt, or
for any other useful purpose whatever.
Instead, it is to be raised in order to allow of
the abolition of the existing Customs duties,
so that the New South Wales agriculturist
will be swamped by cheap imported pro-
ducts, and the artisan will be wiped out by
cheap foreign competition, and the god of
foreign shoddy will again rule in the land.
Altogether ihis latest development is a re-
markable instance of how a great idea may
be manipulated to produce the smallest pos-
sible amount of good, and what good is left
in it be put to the worst possible purpose.
Queensland Politics.
The cynical effrontery of the Queensland
Government inevitably impresses. Probably
never before in Australasia has there existed a
party so politically corrupt, and so careless of
its corruption. The methods of the ring which
controls Parliament are almost entirely directed
to the furtherance of their personal interests
and those of their allies and supporters. That
magnificent abstraction, “ the country,” has
become little but a word, a name, a tiresome
countersign reluctantly given in compliance
with old usage. In the Queensland Parlia-
ment Parkes’s “ constitutional principles ” are
laughed to scorn. The Government commands
a servile majority which rebels once a year —
and regrets it. The Parliamentary officials are
Government creatures, and the rules and forms
of Parliament are twisted at the Government’s
pleasure. A special code of Legislative Assem-
bly Standing Orders, which enables the
Speaker to defy the Assembly itself, is
almost a superfluous Cabinet safeguard.
The Assembly minority is powerless to
prevent the manoeuvres by which the
whole financial machinery of the province
is utilised to advance the interests of the
Queensland National Bank—a reconstructed
institution whose shares are held in large num-
bers by members of the Government party.
The Assembly minority is powerless to prevent
the manoeuvres by which the electoral
machinery of the province is utilised to main-
tain the Government in office, and to thrust its
opponents into voleless obscurity. The Assem-
bly minority, in short, is little more than a
butt for the jeers of the Ministerialists. The
reliable majority of a dozen or so against it is
as effective as a majority of a hundred. It
raves, and argues, and is impotent.
# # •
The Brisbane Courier— the province’s “lead-
ing journal,” and the Government’s spineless
apologist—lately addressed a long article to con-
sideration whether the Government vvas politi-
cally corrupt. It decided, after a series of
amusing pros and cons, that there was no proof
of corruption. Of course, nobody, supposes
that members of the Govt, party walk into the
Treasury with bags and come out laden with
sovereigns. But w hen, with the cotmivance of
the Govt., upw'ards of four millions sterling
are entrusted to a bank which notoriously
controls, as investors or overdrafters, many
members of the Govt, party ; when this im-
mense sum is kept as a floating fund obviously
in the interests of the bank by a province
which only squares its yearly balance-sheet by
the device of further borrowing to meet its
liabilities ; when the bank receives this subsidy
at a less rate of interest than the province pays
for it, and at a far less rate than the bank could
borrow at in the open market ; then it is evi-
dent that the members of the Govt, party
who draw dividends or advances from
the bank which their influence enables
to draw' dividends or advances from the
Treasury, profit just as much at the people’s
expense as if they directly pouched the revenues
of the province. And if, as must be patent to
everybody, the tribute which is levied from
the Treasury is a tribute which, under honest
and sane Government, the Treasury w'ould not
be made to pay, than their arts must be con-
sidered the arts of the boodler—that crisp
American title for the politician who uses his
place to despoil his country. Again, when the
Premier, the head of the Government, publicly
puts himself, as does the Premier of Queens-
sland, at the head of an organisation which is
doing its best to disfranchise electors opposed
to the Government; when the machinery meant
to secure the representation of the people in
Parliament is used to secure the representation
of only that section of the people which is sup-
posed to be friendly to the monopolists of
office; when the head of the Government
actually dares to send or.allows to be sent from
his Govt, office, and with the weight of his
Govt, influence behind him, circulars designed
to advance the interests of ids peculiar party ;
then it is plain that he disgraces himself and
betrays the public trust reposed in him. And
if Parliamentary acquiescence in all these things
does not imply political corruption, then the
common judgment of honest men in all ages is
strangely at fault.
* * m
The Queensland Govt, is not less able than
it is unscrupulous. It is the cunningest
Cabinet of present-day Australasia. Its head,
Premier Nelson, has the Scotch blood and
instinct, and (except at certain times) deals
cannily with friends and foes. Under his rule
the province has made considerable econo-
mies, and were he able to control his col-
leagues the financial policy would still be as
cautious as banking exigencies permitted.
Tozek, the Colonial-Secretary, has limitless
energy and cunning, and not a scrap of political
principle. Philp, the Minister for Mines, and
junior partner in the firm of Burns, Philp and
Co. (called “the octopus of the North ” because
its tentacle-agencies are fixed in every Northern
coastal township), brings a good commercial
head to the Cabinet counsels. Once he called
himself an ardent Northern Separationist, but
office and the dread of Labor-party domination
in the new province have turned his coat. Ex-
chemist Balrymple, Minister for Education,
a man with a dull liver and a clear, logical head,
also represents a Northern constituency.
Attorney-General Byrnes is another bond with
the Catholics. He lies “humbly prostrate at
the feet ” of the Pope, and lately repaid the
priestly influence always exerted on his behalf
by securing the repeal of the law which pre-
vented clerics from wheedling or bullying a
dying man into leaving his assets to churcliT or
chapel. A clever and hard-working young
native, he has preferred Pocket to Principle
“ while the locks are yet brown on his head.”
Any Orange objections to him are silenced by
the memory of the Presbyterian minister who
was Nelson’s father. The others don’t count.
* * *
Since its return to power in ’93, the Govt,
has scored every trick in the game, and at the
present time its position even seems strength-
ened. The loss of Griffith was a gain, for
with him went long traditions of hatred and
unpopularity, and his character did more dis-
service than his ability could recompense.


Since he retired with the plunder of the highest
seat on the Bench and put a nail in the coffin
of the late Judge Harding, the Cabinet has
been found equal—nay, superior—to every
emergency. With an absolute and sheepish
majority at its back it could not .easily,
indeed, go wrong. But, if it could not be
beaten in Parliament, it might, at all
events, have been discredited before the
people. The shame of its policy and con-
duct seemed only to need forceful ex-
posure in order to be made to stink in the
public nostrils. That the Government party
has been enabled to brazen out its disgrace,
and even pretend to a reputation for honor
and fair-dealing, is mainly due to two causes.
The first is the utter demoralisation of
many of the constituencies, whose “ lead-
ing men ” are mere tools of the Bank-om-
Govt. The only electorates to be depended
upon for an intelligent and honest vote are those
peopled by miners or bush-laborers. The towns
swarm with property-voters and their allies ;
the agricultural communities, in Queensland as
elsewhere, are notable for ignorance, apathy,
and mortgages. The Govt, has barricaded the
side of danger by exerting all its influence to
rob miners and shearers of their votes. Em-
ployers’ lists are keenly scanned; the local
J’sP. are all on the qui vive; the power of
authority is strained to the uttermost to “ purge
the rolls ” —of independent voters. Next year’s
elections will show how thoroughly the work
has been done.
* • *
The second cause of the Govt, success is the
worthlessness of the opposition made to it.
The Opposition-party, so called, numbers some
half-dozen members in an Assembly of 72. Its
“ leader,*' Charles Powers, earns respect by
his ability and candor, but lacks virile force.
J. G. Drake is a capable Democrat, who could
stir the country if he would, but seems deficient
in energy or ambition. Besides, a man must
live, and it pays no Queensland lawyer
to go decidedly “agin the Govt.,” which
more or less controls the business in briefs.
When Drake is good—he hears of it; when he
is naughty, he hears of it • harder. So his
criticism has no snap : it is delivered in depre-
catory “Hope no offence?” fashion which
sterilises its venom at once. There wan a time
when Drake was looked to as a coming
democratic leader; but Govt, handed him
the Robb arbitration brief. He took it;
and became almost a political cipher.
Groom— the third notable Q. Oppositionist—is
just Groom, and, as a leader, unthinkable. As
for the Labor-party of 17, which overshadows
the Opposition, it includes two or three promis-
ing men, but they are deficient in political
knowledge and experience. In any case, as
long as Glassey heads the party in virtue of
seniority, its influence will be the least possible.
This terribly vain, sincere, wooden-headed
mouther of ranting rhetoric and interminable
commonplaces is almost enough to sink a pro-
vince, let alone a party.
# * #
To sum up; the Q. Govt, party has a large
preponderance in brains (or brains-available)
over the opposing parties ; it manipulates the
electoral rolls : it commands the Treasury chest
and a campaign fund indirectly fed from the Trea-
sury chest; the ordinary banking andcommercial
channels are the channels of its far superior
influence ; and the voters on whom its influence
is exercised are in many cases easily-amenable
mindless or conscienceless puppets. But it
does not rest satisfied with even these advan-
tages. It has now thrown to the constituencies
a huge bribe in the shape of fifteen railways
which the province is admittedly in no position
to construct, which indeed it is never intended
to construct; it is making sure of the
squatters’ influence by extending leases for 10
years over a vast area in defiance of the
demands for land for settlement; it divides
forces which might unite to oppose it, and sets
North against Centre by the proposed Hughen-
den-Winton railway extension ; it is further
fomenting dissension between Central settlers
on the coast and in the interior ; it believes it
has secured die sugar-districts with the con-
tinued Kanaka and the loans or promises of
loans for mill-erection. Thanks to these things
and this policy, the Q. Govt.-party promises to
come back from next year’s elections with un-
diminished—even with increased—forces. Of
course, the country will rue it. For, some day,
the bill of its dishonesty must assuredly be
paid, and by the workers whom it is now
drugging into torpor —or driving to despair.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The North Shore Railway Grab.
Sydney Telegraph, which is fast becoming the
recognised organ of the local Fat Man, oilers,
in a leading article, the following reasons why
the most important section of the Australian
railway-system should be handed over to private
speculators :
In this colony, however, there has lately grown up a
tendency to oppose all such enterprises on the part of
private persons, and denounce those proposing to under-
take them as greedy monopolists intent upon grinding
the faces of the poor. Every application to Parliament
for authority to embark capital in developing the country’s
resources is met in this spirit by a certain section of the
House, with the result that buyers and sellers of labor
are kept compulsorily apart, idle money clogs the banks,
unemployed men throng the streets, and the general pro-
gress of the colony is blocked. The time is coming when
this suicidal policy must be abandoned in order to avert
serious national consequences. Hitherto the practice has
been to look to the Government for everything, but it has
been overdone, and money is no longer available in the
profusion that it used to be. We have carried out State
indebtedness to a point at which it cannot be safely in-
creased for some l irne to come. Meanwhile, unless reason-
able scope is allowed to men who are prepared to carry
on the work of national development at their own risk,
industry will have to suffer, and many of the resources of
the colony lie dormant.
The Bulletin doesn’t profess to know whether
the D.T. has tiny interest, apart from its sym-
pathy for Fat Man interests generally, in the
North Shore private-railway dodge, but the
above is a slab of hollow mockery in any case.
The number of unemployed in New South
Wales is set down, on good authority, at over
20,000. The North Shore railway syndicate is
only pledged to spend £30,000 on its job in
the first 18 months, and, making a very small
allowance for the amount required to be spent
on machinery, supervision, materials, &c., &c.,
this only provides for the employment of about
150 men at the very utmost —probably 100
would be nearer the mark. The very tem-
porary absorption of less than 1 per cent, of
the unemployed would be bought a great deal
too dear at the price. Moreover, the syndicate
would almost certainly float its concession in
England, so that the idle money which now
festers in the local banks wouldn't be affected
in the least. The banks are clogged at the
present moment largely because Premier Reid
insisted, a few months ago, in floating a huge
loan in England instead of issuing it locally.
The Government sends all the good investment
securities to London instead of letting the local
capitalist buy them, and for want of these
means of investment he has to clog the bank
with his money, and the remedy for this
is common-sense, not syndicates. Further,
the Telegraph travels on the assump-
tion that the State must stop public
works because it can’t borrow any more
at present; i.e., the State must under no cir-
cumstances build public works except with
borrowed money, and when it can’t borrow the
works must be handed over to private specu-
lators. This is about the most insolvent variety
of logic ever heard of. If the State would raise
another <£500,000 a year in taxation and save
.£500,000 a year out of revenue, and spend the
proceeds on much-needed public works, it
could relieve the clog on the banks consider-
ably, and furnish employment for 3000 or 4000
men who now have none, and as they would
dissipate their wages among grocers and boot-
makers and drapers and publicans and tote-
shop-keepers, and other deserving and un-
deserving persons, there would be a burst of
prosperity in New South Wales which that
province badly wants. The trouble just now is
not that money is scarce, for actual coin is
probably more abundant than it ever was
before, even at the top of the biggest boom,
but that it won’t circulate. If the State pro-
ceeded to forcibly circulate some of it in useful
undertakings it would do more good than if it
jobbed away 50 valuable concessions to 50
British syndicates, and thereby mortgaged
the country to J. Bull six deep.
Legal Settlements.
One of Melbourne’s recent shark stories depicts
the learned monster of the deep in a cannibal-
istic mood. The yarn was told to the Insol-
vency Court by a railway employb who had
filed his schedule in self-defence. Insolvent got
drawn into litigation with a widow through
being an executor of her departed husband’s
will. Seemingly he had all the law on his
side, so, after a while, the widow’s side pro-
posed a settlement. He agreed to accept ,£lO
and costs. His own solicitor disapproved of
his indifference to petty details, but he went—
rash railway employb that he was ! —to the
widow’s legal advisers, and fixed the matter up
“ on the understanding that he was not to be
subjected to any claim by them for costs.” His
own costs amounted to £64, and the widow was
to pay these. The executor deluded himself
with the idea that his legal troubles were now
at an end. Instead, however, of getting the
widow’s cheque for £64, wherewith to pay his
own costs to his own solicitor, he allowed the
lady to hand the money to her solicitors (on
the ground that they were now acting for both
sides), who would, she supposed, pass it along
to the other side and get a receipt. The
money was not passed along. On several occa-
sions the nervous executor enquired as to
whether his bill of costs had been settled, and
was told that the holders of the £64 were
“ seeing further about it.” Perhaps they
meant him to infer that they would see him
further. At last they unfolded their intention
to keep the £64 on account of their costs
against him—“ although he had understood all
along that he was not to be charged any costs ”
—for agreeing to let them settle the widow’s
case. Clearly these solicitors couldn’t confis-
cate the money without putting in some definite
claim to it, so now, for the first time, they
made out a bill to the tune of £72. Then
the weary executor became suddenly wise
and filed his schedule, leaving his original
solicitor to prove a claim for £64 against the
estate. The fate of the £64 which never
reached its alleged destination, but was swal-
lowed up on the road, is an awful lesson in
legal practice. During 10 months’ possession
of the sum aforesaid, these patient solicitors
were frequently requested to pass it along to
their professional rival. Perhaps their own
costs of £72 were incurred by such requests.
The rash executor may have called and called
to desire a prompt settlement of the little
matter until his unsatisfactory interviews had
absorbed £8 more than the amount in hand.
The first duty of any lawyer who receives money
on account of a third person’s costs is to see
further about it, and allow a prior claim for
costs to grow out of the bare fact that his client
comes worrying round.

The cable is being worked for all it is worth in
the interests of the Cremorne coal people, who
want to disfigure the shores of Sydney harbor
with coal-tips in the interests of a British syn-
dicate. Witness the following, headed “Strong
Feeling in London ” :
London, Friday.—A strong feeling has been excited in
the City by rumors that the New South Wales Govern-
ment intend to cancel the leases for foreshores granted to
the Sydney Harbor Collieries Company.
The company are relying upon the Government to
carry out promises made, as they have already expended
large sums of money on the strength of those promises.
The simple and obvious answer to this piece of
bluff is that no leases of the foreshores were
ever granted so far as the N.S. Wales public
ever heard of. The co., so far as is known, has
its coal-lease all right; but, as regards its claim
to put up a collection of hideous machinery on a
picturesque harbor frontage, it merely had a
promise of a site from the Govt, or some mem-
bers of the Govt., and it knew that the promise
must be subject to the risk of Parliamentary
influence, and if it chose to spend money
before it got its lease or assured itself of
the Assembly’s approval, that is entirely
its own funeral. The Assembly never ap-
proved. Also, there is no need for more coal-
mines at present as the ones already open are
only partially employed, and so the only way
the British Cremorne Co. could make a trade
at present would be by annexing the business
of the N.S. Wales colliery-owners, and, under
these conditions, there seems no special reason
why the Assembly should approve just now.
Further, it is just possible, astonishing as it
may appear, that the province doesn’t care a
straw whether there is a strong feeling in
London or not.
♦
Parson Clarke’s complaint that all persons
are not treated alike under N.S.W. Divorce
Court administration has a sufficient foundation
of truth to start a less excitable man than the
Kogarah apostle into the wilds of seditious
invective. In Germany, all divorce cases are
heard in camera, and there seldom, as a con-
sequence, emanates any derisive criticism from
proceedings there. The theory in New South
Wales is that all divorce cases shall be heard in
public—it is the law, in fact—and if the theory
were strictly adhered to, seditious criticism
of the lacerated Clarke kind would not be ex-
cited. Without, however, actually breaking the
law by hearing cases in camera, Judges have, at
various times, so conducted divorce business in
the interests of influential individuals that out-
siders, particularly uninfluential ones suffering
from dissimilar treatment, feel that there is one
method of divorce-court procedure for one class
of suitors, and another for another, and so feel-
ing explode into vituperative complaint. N.S.
Wales divorce-court law is better than the
German in theory, but is worse in practice in
this respect, because the German law is equally
administered over all, whereas the N.S.W. law
picks and chooses among its suitors in the
attempt to placate individuals of a class.
The feeling of the Yic. Crown Law Department
in the magisterial corruption enquiry is guessed
at, rightly or wrongly, from the department’s
first proposal to place accuser Lobmer’s case in
the hands of Bryan O’Loghlen. Clearly,
O’Loghlen was about the last Melbourne
barrister to sympathise enthusiastically
with Lormer’s complaints of bench-packing,
for Lobmeb is the J.P. who was instrumental
in committing Matthew Davies for trial on a
charge which O’Loghlen had tried to squelch
with his notorious nolle prosequi. Lormer,
moreover, has publicly denounced O’Loghlen as
a politician and a lawyer. Considering all things,
the Crown Law Department idea of a suitable
counsel for the prosecution, or what is practi-
cally the prosecution, in the Melb. police court
scandals case seems to suggest—well, what does
it suggest? Isaac Isaacs, be it carefully re-
membered, is the Ministerial head of the Yic.
Crown Law Dept., and he retired from the
Patterson Ministry, a couple of years ago,
on account of Bryan O’Loghlen having refused
to prosecute certain bankers whom one plucky
magistrate had committed for trial in opposi-
tion to a crowd of biassed colleagues. The
result of the enquiry into Lormer’s allegations
of Smellbourne police-court injustice will be
worth looking for after the Board has delivered
judgment. The Board is satisfactory, inasmuch
as Judge Williams takes the chair.
The reason w'hy a woman’s “fall” is considered
unpardonable, and a man’s venial, is discussed
by A. Clerk, in the New Review. He
broaches the theory of “ Each sex its own
moralist ” :
Does anybody really believe that monogamous marriage
was the invention of men, or would be maintained by men
as the cardinal institution of civilised society, if women
had nothing to say in the matter? It appears to me in-
finitely more probable that it was first devised, and then
by degrees enforced, by women, for their own advantage,
and, moreover, that it is by women, and for their own
advantage, that the institution is maintained at this
moment.
If men, without any loss of character or of self-esteem,
could get from a succession of young and plnsically
attractive wives the companionship, the care, and the
affection that they now get only from one as long as she
lives, I maintain that a large proportion of the most
virtuous and excellent men now living in this and other
countries would gladly and promptly do so. They con-
sent to he limited to one wife because they cannot get
that companionship, care and affection at all from the
women they like best on any other terms. They are glad
to pay the price because they cannot otherwise get the
article. It oes not at all follow that they would not get
it cheaper if they could.
The general agreement of virtuous women to marry
only on terms of monogamy may be likened to the reso-
lution of a trade-union not to accept less than a certain
rate demanded. The labor which the masters require
is the companionship and affection of women. Good
women are the union, and they exact the union rate.
Women who will give men all or some part of the
required companionship and affection for any con-
sideration less than marriage are in a position
analogous to that of “ blacklegs,” who will work for the
masters at less than the rate prescribed by the union.
There is no general strike because of the complete and
permanent acceptance by all the best masters of all the
terms required by the union. But the blacklegs exist,
and it may possibly be the fact that their existence pre-
vents the union from exacting a yet higher rate of wagts
than it does.
Everyone who knows anything whatever of “labor”
troubles must have been impressed by the extraordinarily
bitter and unappeasable animosity entertained by work-
men who will not take less than the wages demanded by
the unions against men who will. The hatred is not
mutual, for the rate-cutter, unle-s he is personally
molested, has no particular hatred of the workman
whose rate he cuts, but it is almost invariably quite
strong enough to lead to murder if it were not for the
police. Compare with this the relentless anger with
which the woman who, not being married, to a greater
or less extent replaces a wife, is regarded by virtuous
women. It is the same sort of feeling. The unmarried
mistress and the prostitute are “cutting the rate.” That
is why they are remorselessly “hounded out of society,”
and will be as long as honest women have society sub-
stantially under their control and are free to associate,
or not to associate, with whom they will.
But to men, who have not the same direct and paramount
interest in the maintenance of monogamous marriage, the
man who does not marry his mistress is not a “ blackleg.”
He is merely a person who has paid a second-rate price
tor a second rate article.
Now, if it is impossible to make men more virtuous, it
might conceivably be possible to make women more easy-
going. In order to do that, it would be necessary to
persuade the virtuous women that they could live equally
useful, honest, happy and satisfactory lives, if they con-
sented to unite themselves with individual men upon less
exacting terms. Then female virtue would cease to be
the invaluable commodity it now is, and the loss of it
would no longer incur the tremendous penalties now
ruthlessly inflicted.
-
The Pope’s is not the only claim to infallibility.
A recent ejectment case in Victoria brought by
the executors of the late Webb, J., shows in
the event that the Supreme Court memory is
infallible. The barrister (by the way, a per-
sona inr/rata to some extent by reason of his
having been a solicitor before the amalgama-
tion) for defendant showed by means of short-
hand notes taken by both sides that the Judge
who originally tried the case had made import-
ant omissions in his notes of the trial. The
Full Court (as is the manner of Full Courts in
general) scouted as ridiculous the suggestion
that the Judge had forgotten anything when
giving his judgment. “We’ve never heard
such a suggestion before. Do you mean
to imply that the Judge had forgotten ? ”
not an altogether absurd implication in face of
the fact that the judgment was given two
months after the trial. There is a risk of
serious injustice in this matter of Judge’s notes.
In the Vic, County Court the situation is occa
sionally scandalous, through the laziness, 01
sometimes even temper, of the Judge who is
asked to take a note for the purposes of appeal.
Whatever he puts down is gospel true, although
everyone in Court (including a phonograph)
may know positively that the very opposite
was said.
John Haynes, M.L.A., has his own particular
remedy for the woes of the Sydney unem-
ployed. “I pin my faith with regard to the
solution of this difficulty to the freeing of the
trade of the port, which would employ 5000
more men within one month.” How would it ?
Freetrade won’t make the country export any
more, for the export trade is already free and
can’t be made any freer than it is, and N.S. W. is
already exporting as much as it can at present
raise. Therefore, there must be 5000 more
men employed in the importing business if they
are to be employed at all, and that should be
equal to the importation of something like
£10,000,000 more goods per annum, and how
New South Wales is to pay for them, or even
to owe for them, no one knows. The curse of
Freetrade theories is the great lack of parti-
culars.
H. T. Wrenfordsley, Chief Justice of the
Leeward Islands, West Indies, writes to Lon-
don Times pointing out that the increase in
Australasian trade goes, not into the hands of
the British foreigner, but chiefly into those of
the French foreigner, the German alien, and
the American ditto. This is a sad state of things,
says Wrenfordsley. “Let the present loss
of trade continue, and the question may arise in
the next Administration of what need is it to
add to the burdens of Imperial expenditure for
the up-keep of colonies which have already re-
linquished the main part of their trade with
the home country.” This is the same old
hallucination. Australia is a mere dependent
on Britain’s bounty ; she doesn’t pay £130,000
a year for looking at a naval squadron which
Britain controls; she doesn’t send an annual
tribute of 16 millions sterling to the British
usurer ; the sun shines for her, and the tides
rise and fall, and M'Cooey discovers new
lizards—all by gracious permission of J. Bull.
There is no doubt about that personage’s super-
divine generosity, only—will Chief Justice
Wrenfordsley kindly explain exactly where
it comes in ?

himself with it in full view of all the members
during the last all-night sitting in Bananaland
Assembly.
During the discussion in Yic. Assembly of
the female-franchise clauses in the Electoral Bill,
Helen Hart appeared in the House bearing a huge
label on her breast, “Champion of the Women’s
Franchise in Victoria.” The lady was gently, but
firmly, requested to remove the placard, but she
objected, and left the House in wrath.
Creswick (Vic.) Advertiser, Nov. 22 ;
At Wheeler’s Bridge, where Miss Sanders was
fatally bitten by a black snake, several such rep-
tiles have since been despatched. One resident
killed 36 in one day, whilst others have killed as
many as 10, 13, and 14 in one day. The other day
one was found coiled round the leg of the piano at
Dilena’s hotel, and another of the length of 6ft.
4m. found its way into the bar.
Canon Piddington, of N.S. W., writes The
Bulletin’s London correspondent, is making
great efforts to raise money for the Bishopric of
Grafton, and is to spout at a Mansion House
meeting, for the purpose of raising a fund in aid.
But why impose on the people of England? If
the Grafton and Armidale Episcopalians wish to
indulge in the luxury of a figurehead in breeches
and gaiters, they should surely pay for it them-
selves.
Melb. dailies are not on speaking-terms
with the poets. Both Age and Argus give us
Gordon’s lines so ;
If ever I strike as a man should strike,
If I struck hut one stroke that was good in thy sight.
Gordon wrote : “ If ever I smote as a man should
smite,” &c. Recently, too, the Argus departed
from the safe rule of “as the poet says,” and
ascribed to Tennyson Coleridge’s lines, beginning
“ He prayeth best who loveth best.”
A friend of Henniker Heaton’s, writing
privately to Sydney, says that Henniker was
really not injured in his chances for the British
Postmaster-Generalship by the support given him
by the newspapers. “Lord Salisbury’s choice
was between Lord Londonderry and the Duke of
Norfolk and Henniker, and all three had rendered
great party services. Leading papers regarded
Heaton’s claims most favorably, quite irrespec-
tive of politics. Please don’t jibe at Heaton on
the familiarity-contempt principle. He is a
reformer, and has done big things in postal ad-
ministration. It was he who introduced the
telegraph money-order system into Great Britain,
and reduced the postage of letters to Australia
from 6d. to 2Jd. (long before the Postal Union).
One of the first questions he asked in the Com-
mons was why post-cards were not allowed to be
sent to Australia, and he succeeded in getting
penny post-cards from here, although you have to
pay for a post-card to England. Altogether,
there are 40 reforms to his credit—including the
reduction of press and public cable charges to
Australia.”
A tight place. While driving a mob of
cattle in Southern Queensland, writes a correspon-
dent, I and my mate one night camped on the
edge of some thick timber. After tea I rolled up
in my blanket while my mate went off to do a bit
of fishing. During his absence the cattle st.im-
peded and went straight for the fire, beside which
I was lying. I shut my teeth and shivered. The
front bullock, seeing a movement, jumped over
me with a snort, and those behind imitated him.
Four hundred head of cattle, off with a rush, of
whom at least 50 must have jumped over me. I
got up when the cyclone had passed, to find every-
thing round, billy and all, tiodden out flat, and
consider I owe my life to that involuntary
shudder.

SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR OOMINU WEEK.
Lyceum “ Our Hoyg.”
Theatre Royal “ His Natural Life.”
Tivoli Rickards' Variety Co,
Sydney Music Hall Variety Co.
MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR OOMINO WEEK.
Princess's Theatre “La Belle TWrfcse.”
Opera House Rickards’ Variety Co.
The management of Sydney Lyceum wisely
threw overboard the dreadful “Carson Case”
after a week’s trial, and if, any time within the
next three months, a drowned nightmare is
washed ashore on the coast of Bohemia, the
chances are that it will be this particular night-
mare and no other. In place of the defunct pro-
duction “Our Boys’’ was staged on Monday
night, and went with all its old-time brightness
and vim. Byron’s wonderful comedy grew old
and dropped out of sight so long ago that it has
almost become new again ; at all events, there are
many among the present generation of playgoers
who never saw it. It is played by the Lyceum
co. about as well as it ever was in all its long and
chequered career. Elton is a butterman of vast
experience and much brilliance. Scot luglis and
Granville Blake are both up to high-water mark,
and the slavey of Miss Polly Emery is the brightest
feature of the show. Nobody in Australia ever
got ahead of this lady as the smudged apparition
of a cheap boarding-house—the kind of female who
never has time to lace her boots, and who carries
the breakfast-things and the coal-scuttle with one
hand while she reads about the wicked baronet in
the Journal and falls downstairs over the cat
with the other. Also, it is tolerably safe to assert
that nobody in Australia ever dressed the part
more artistically. Concerning the others, there is
nothing to com plainof except Miss Helen Dauvray’s
rather wild taste in hats and the excessive repose-
fulness of shapely King Hedley, whose gentle-
manly calm makes him almost inaudible a good
part of the time. Possibly, however, this rather
muffled frame of mind is a characteristic of the
British aristocracy, and arises in some way
through coming over with the Conqueror. King
Hedley’s baronet, however, doesn’t look as if he
came in with the Conqueror ; he looks like the
sort of individual who might have graciously
allowed the Conqueror to come in with him, pro-
vided that potentate behaved himself.
Captain Frere, as represented by Plimmer,
is about the finest thing in the drama, and by far
the best that actor has yet done in Sydney. He
starts Frere as a nice-looking scoundrel, but the
warrior takes to drink by way of relieving the
monotony of old Vandemonia, and becomes
bloated, and doesn’t shave regularly. Each act
shows him a little more bloated and unshaven
than the one before ; there is a touch of high art
about the gradual rotting-away of this officer,
until his final decease, owing to a brick, is sugges-
tive of a club striking a piece of damaged meat,
Dampier gives a very fine rendering of Parson
North, but the character is by no means good
enough for him. Alfred Rolfe’s Rufus Dawes is a
respectable performance ; and Overton is a big,
realistic, gorilla-like Gabbett, with a set of
horse-teeth like a neglected post-and-rail fence,
which lend local color to that old-established
family cannibal. The rest of the cast are princi-
pally Leston, who runs Parson Meekin on oily-
wormy lines with much success ; and Misses Lily
Dampier and Austen Elliott; also convicts Nos.
2964 to 2993, and numerous people who bash these
offenders in the interests of order, and call them
“ dawg,” and sentence them to have 50 lashes
immediately.

Friday will be the last night of “ Dean
Maitland ” at Sydney Royal, and on Saturday the
management also puts up a version of “ His
Natural Life,” so that there will be the remark-
able spectacle of Marcus Clarke’s tale of woe run-
ning at two theatres simultaneously. It is
vaguely understood that there is friction between
the two managements, each being of opinion that
it is the only genuine article with the name on
the bottle as a guarantee of good faith, while the
other management is a cheap imitation. Also
each one holds that its Gabbett has more dreadful-
looking teeth than the other Gabbett, and that the
horrors of penal servitude at the other house_ are
hardly worth mentioning. Probably the best idea
would be to combine the shows, and let the two
Gabbetts strangle tlie two Trokes together, and
the two Meekins maunder side by side, and lift
their hats at exactly the same angle, and the two
Freres, both drunk, lie killed simultaneously by a
duplicate oonvict, and then Dawes —both of him
—could fall into the four arms of his double-bar-
relled parent and live happily ever after.

Sydney Tivoli is much as it was last week,
and the boom continues unabated. Harry
Richards and his wonderful hat are understood to
be on their way back from England with a bag
full of coster and other melodies.
** * *
The Sydney Music Hall has laid in the
champion high-kicker of the universe—one
Mooney, who does plain kicks to an elevation of
ten feet, and fancy kicks with frills to great
heights. Anew farce, which is funnier than most
farces, is also thrown in, and the musical part of
the show is in good health and condition. Also
the treasury was understood to be in a bloated
state when last heard from.

Mark Twain, who was 60 on St. Andrew’s
day, will be back in Sydney from Maoriiand on
18th inst. He will at once go to Banaualand, and
on his return, before embarking for India on the
Oceana, lie will give in the Centenary Hall an
entirely new lecture, which has taken well in
Maoriiand. The contract with R. S. Smythe
includes India and Smith Africa.
** * *
Last week’s notice of “ The Yeomen” in-
cluded a printer’s error that might be easily set
right if the original idea hadn’t gone astray.
Under these circumstances the error in question
must descend to posterity on its own.
** * *
The French comedy-opera, due at Melb.
Princess’s on Saturday last, was postponed for
further rehearsal or something, and some more
“Mikado” happened in its stead. A feature of
this revival is the new Nanki-Poo (Courtice
Pounds) who brings an exuberantly cheerful
manner and a fine, muscular pair of limbs to bear
upon the matter. Howard Vernon and Miss Ida
Osborne are in their former places ; also, Miss
Young repeats her recent Katisha, and Miss
Wray imitates Nellie Stewart rather more suc-
cessfully than she did. “ Mikado ”is such an old
favorite by this time that “Charity Begins at
Home” lias been called in to support it, or per-
haps the opera and operetta help to hold one
another up. Anyway, they, are both of them
upon the bill, and George Lauri is appearing as
Joe Bumpus for the first time at this theatre.
• « *
“ La Belle Ther&se ” will be produced next
Saturday (Deo. 7), unless an earthquake inter-
venes.

John Coleman, the horsey-looking young
man with the eccentric legs and utterly inane
songs, is making things brisker at Melb. Opera
House. There are unusual incidents in his gam-
bols, and droll ideas in his make-up, but the
occasional song-words which wait upon Coleman’s
legs, so to speak, mark the distinction between
wit and humor. Outside the Princess’s and Opera
House show business is asleep in Melbourne. The
Gaiety has suspended operations, the Royal is
waiting for Boxing Night, and the mesmerist has
gone away—with, let us hope, his cataleptic sub-
ject in tow.
That fine old brawny horror, “HisNatural
Life,” was resurrected at Her Majesty’s on Satur-
day, and goes well from beginning to end. The
prologue in this version is somewhat confused, as
a great effort is made to rush all the leading
characters into one small room and let them
explain themselves before the woe begins.
Beyond that, there is little to complain of, except,
perhaps, that the horror has been toned-down a
good deal, and some of the dreadful raw-meat
element left out, through a kindly regard for the
nerves of the audience. The convicts are allowed
to be unduly humorous at their work, and they
break the road-metal in quite a festive spirit at
times, except Gabbett, who refuses to break road-
metal at all, and simply stands round and defies
constituted authority. The fact that the law isn’t
strong enough to overwhelm Gabbett is a weak
point and an obvious discrepancy. The rack on
which Dawes is fixed seems to be a rather com-
fortable stretcher, and the old idea that it was a
gridiron with bars, and the convict’s strangled
head lolling over the end of it, and his tongue
hanging out and nearly reaching the ground, is
apparently exploded. Also, though the triangles
are set up once or twice, the flogging never comes
off, and there is no procession of ants, each carry-
ing away a bit of the convict’s back. Still, the
atmosphere of horror is all there, and the huge
stone walls are very realistic, and the aspect of
Troke and Gabbett and Maurice Frere is power-
fully suggestive of blood, and mangled flesh, and
dark cells, and similar bric-a-brac.
At Poverty Point .
P.M.: If Thespians don’t suicide—as certainly they
don’t to any abnormal degree—what generally becomes
of them? One operatic priina-donna takes in washing in
a Melb. suburb, while a one-time stock melodramatic
actor is rouseabout at a pub. It is, unhappily, almost a
certainty that, if followed out, the career of the majority
of players will he found to have ended miserably. Actors,
like public servants, should be compelled to assure their
lives.
It is not generally known that the late Arthur Dacre
was a divorcA “ Incompalihility of disposition” was
ground of decree nisi. He left a son by his first wife.
Arthur Dacre’s first wile was the daughter of a clergy,
man, and on dit that ten years or so ago, at about the
time of ids divorce, he attempted suicide by opening an
artery in his wrist. His London acquaintances, to whom
his eccentricities were notorious, will not he astonished at
his fate. On one occasion he quarrelled violently with
Bancroft (then running St. James’s Theatre, London)
owing to the latter expressing dissatisfaction witli ids
rehearsals as the Count, in “Fedora.” Bancroft, to
spare Dacre’s feelings, did not bring in another actor, but
took up the part himself, offering to pay Dacre’s salary
just as if he acted. But the emotional actor was enraged
at this treatment, raved that it would ruin his reputation,
and finally severed Ids connection with the theatre. He
subsequently played his part at Brighton with Laura
Villiers, of “ Dancing Girl” fame, and his performance
did not prove, as Bancroft feared, “impossible." It was
on this occasion that the fair and massive Laura’s papa
provided a special train for moat of the leading London
pros, to go down and see his daughter act, and afterwards
ntertained them all at a big banquet.
Paradis: “I saw Amy Ro-elle act two characters in
Melb., and declaie they were perfection for such parts,
because anything more would have lnen over-acting!
Probably no living performer could equal her Ladv
Macbeth.” J
A Bulletin correspondent The maiden name of Amy
Roselle was Hawkins. N arly 30 years ago writer used to
play marbles with her little brothers. The hero of the
family at that time was Percy Roselle, a boy actor, who
had some vogue as Prince Arthur, and in like parts.
Father Hawkins was the stereotyped old actor—same
brand as other old actors—and was lessee of a theatre in
Whitechapel. Amy was bred on the boards, I have seen
her from minor parts in pant mime to lead in tragedy,
and, while technically srood, she never displayed the sav-
ing spark of genius. - 11. P.
A Melb. weekly gravely states that “ the Daores lost a
lot of money—as much, it is said, as £ll,OO0 —in their
Australian ventures." The unfortunate couple had no
money of their own to lose when they landed at Mel-
bourne.
Seeing that Minnie Palmer had broken off ail business
relations with husband Rogers lie didn’t lose much by
getting finally divorced from her. Nine years ago, when
she came to Australia, little Minnie was already a painful
suggestion of the old age in store for her. The fluffy
yellow hair, pearl-coated complexion, and aggressively
girlish tricks were for all time, undoubtedly, and the
thought of living on to celebrate a golden wedding with
that fancy doll must have haunted Rogers whenever his
liver was amiss. Minnie seems to have found some—
co-respondents, nevertheless.
A certain lady-memher of a well-known opera co. is
said to have lost her heart. She built up an almost
unique reputation for never failing in love witli any sort
of brother artist, hut theatrical circumstances grew too
strong for her at last. She was thrown so much and so
often into somebody’s arms when one particular opera
came along, and such large doses of passion were pro-
vided for them by the stage-manager, that her native hue
of resolution became sicklied o’er with the pale cast of
a newly-awakened sentiment, and she is now suspected of
heavitig sighs in the gloaming.
Manager Williamson has captured Miss Orelli, they say,
for the Japanese panto, at Melb. Princess’s, which pro-
mises to have some capital singing and dancing in it, any-
way. Florence Young takes a leading part, and Coleman,
of the eccentric legs, joins Ihe forces.
Pianist Mark Hamhourg and Gaiety-hoy Bradfleld were
each paid 40 guineas for taking part in a Toorak at home,
one afternoon shortly before Cup-time.
Tapley, it would seem, derived some of his vocal man-
ner sms from Courtice Pounds.
“The Yeomen of the Guard” has ever been an unlucky
op«ra with the Firm. In the early days of its prodnoiion
Nellie Stewart fell ill and May Pollard had to come in at
short notice. On another occasion a chorus lady was re-
quired to take the part of Dam" Carruthers, which she
treated rattier cruelly. Last week a really first-class per-
formance was weakened by the failure of Wallace Brown-
low’s voice—lie had to speak, or rattier croak, Ins singing
lines—and the temporary loss of Ida Osborne. The deputy
for Miss 1.0. was her sister, Nina, strikingly like her in
appearance and mariner, but not as capable an artiste,
Nina’s voice is thinner and more nasal than Ida’s. All
the same, she is a very suitable substitute for her relative.
In Australia a medium voice is almost a curse. A week
nr two back, the baritone halladist at a variety-show was
“sacked” to make room for another at 25». a week, and
male choristers, debarred from other work by morning
rehearsals, are glad to get £1 weekly. No wonder a Mel-
bourne theatrical super has become assistant to the
hangman.
A theatrical star down north, or somewhere over there,
arrived per mail, and an insinuating young man on the
staff of one of the dailies announced the fact that “Mr.
Blank and Miss Asterisk, both under engagement to Sock
and Buskin,” were to hand. Subsequent inquiry dis-
closed ttie fact that Miss Asterisk was not necessarily for
publication, and was not stipulated for in the contract.
Hence these tears.
Coleman, the joyous burlesque dancer of Harry
Riekards’s show, now at Melb. Opera House, is to he a
cheerful feature of the Firm’s Jap. panto, at the Prin-
cess’s. Tits is a guarantee of some new jukes in the
“ Krishmiss ” show, if Coleman has to crack them with
his excruciating legs.
Miss Ada Crossley (writes The Bulletin’s London cor-
respondent) has been more fortunate in mining specula-
tion than in the practice of her profession ; if rumor is to
he credited she lias made quite au important haul out of
Great Boulders, her guide, philosopher and friend being
Mr. Brookman, of Adelaide, who himself has made a for-
tune out of Zeb. Lane’s fluky success. Ada has unfor-
tunately not been so much appreciated in England as
might have been expected of one who really sings so
nicely, and is so charming personally. One great mistake
of hers has been behaving so tactlessly towards Santley,
who is a power in the musical world of England. Not,
mind you, that the great singer has ever done anything
to injure Ada, or to interfere with her prospects, but
somehow people took sides in the matter, and the strong
side was not hers.
Lilian Tree has been engaged for the London production
of tiie Wagnerian operas, which are to be produced as
they have never been placed on the stage in England
before. She has been selected to play Brunnhilde in the
opera of “The Valkyrie,” and will have the honor of
being the first to render the part in England.
Gov. Buxton has given his patronage to “ Dick Whit-
tington’s ” benefit at Adelaide Royal, on Dec. 4—H.E.’s
first entrance into the Temple of Thespis since his arrival
in S.A.
A London weekly sneers at what it calls The Bulletin’s
“charming inconsistency” in saying that Louis Brad-
field imitated Leslie when he wasn't trying to reproduce
Arthur Roberts. Nevertheless, Bradfleld did both things
every evening, and everybody who had seen the originals
observed him consistently doing it.
Gladstone (Gladdy) is yet a Melb. familiar father of the
profession, said to be the oldest man and oldest actor.
Original Frederic Noble in Charles Matthews’ London
production of “ The Game of Speculation,” 1851, and,
though pretty well up in the tooth, repeated it when
Matthews acted Affable Hawk in Melt)., 20 years later,
since which 24 have revolved. His last part was My Lord
Bishop in “ Lady Windermere’s Pan.”
The funniest incident in Maud Williamson’s stage
career occurred when she was playing the part of the
blind heroine in “Queen’s Eudence,” at Drury Lane.
She had to walk across the bridge, “ gapped ” in the
centre by the villain, and tall 20 feet into the water. The
fall w’as supposed to be eased by means of a wire and
counterweight. But, on the first night, on account of
the weight having been wrongly adjusted, the heroine,
instead of falling, was swung up and suspended in mid-
air. Meanwhile, the hero had taken his cue, and jumped
in to the rescue. The curtain was dropped on the
ludicrous scene, to the accompaniment of roars of
laughter from the auditorium, and prolific cursing from
manager Harris, behind.
The various Melb. suburban juvenile minstrel and bur-
lesque co’s are almost extinct. The suburbanites have
had a surfeit of these pigmy shows.
The proprietor of a certain Melb. music-hall endeavored
to negotiate with a co. to keep possession of ids hall free
of charge for one month, but failed to tempt them.
Miss Heloise Austa, the soprano engaged for the leading
part in “Pat, or the B'dls of Rathbeal,” atS)dney Royal,
is the daughter of Duvalli-Coutts.
There will be only two theatres open in Melbourne
until Boxing Night—the Princess’s and the Opera House.
When Maud Williamson was endeavoring, in 1883, to
“catch the eye” of some theatrical impresario, she used
to visit all the leading managers with a poison phial and
a dagger in her pocket, and give the “cell scene” from
“Romeo and Juliet” as a taste of her quality. All of
them advised her that, without money and influence,
stage success was unattainable. But she persevered, and
in the course of her pilgrimage tried the Juliet business
on S’Agustus ’Ariis. 'Arris took it all in, and then
offered the dramatic aspirant a part in his pantomime, at
£2 10s. a week. Maud fled in indignant disgrace. Finally,
a clerical friend of her pious parents, seeing that she was
determined “to go to the devil,” and, desiiing that she
should do so in good style, invited her to a dinner at
which Lord Hartington, now Duke of Dev 'nshire, was
present. She recited before the company, with the result
that Hartington shortly afterwards introduced her to the
Kendals. With them she got opportunities. The rest
was easy.
Melb. demise : Wadley, respected music-hall tenor.
Some people, noticing that John Coleman acts in Melb.,
think it is the veteran English actor and author.
Variety: “I never saw an artist put such a terrific
amount of work into a turn as Cob man, nowin Melb.
Irving’s wife sent a request to Edwin Booth,in London,
for an order with: “ I want my sons to see an actor.”
Tragedian Nesbitt’s grave, Geelong, is being done up
hi - subscription, Brooke, though he never saw Nesbitt,
paid for tire memorial, because people said N. was so
much like him in appearance voice and action, which the
Hip Van Winkles bear out.
Melb. Anti-Sweating League is turning its attention to
sweated theatrical employes. Not before it was needed,
either.
Phil Beck was the most notable theatrical suicide of
late years.
It is possible ttiat Charles Holloway will risk another
re-opening of Melbourne Alexandra at Xmas, with Maggie
Moore as chief attraction.
Rignold leaves Melb. the richer by about £BOO, as the
result of his eight weeks’ season.
Rignold returns to his farm at Bray brook from Melb. to
dig potatoes prior to a Xmas tour of Maoriiand. His
contemplated English trip is off, the limelight man having
decided to follow the Bland Holtian plan of touring the
Australias with a strong melodramatic repertoire.
J. N. Eilaby, who took rank next to Clifford Harrison
as a reciter in England, and who was on his way to Aus-
tralia in a sailing vessel to tour under Smy the’s guidance,
died at sea of consumption.
George Rignold lias bought from Clifton Alderson the
Australian rights of “Tommy Atkins,” a recent warlike
drama that is said to go well in Hingland. Alderson, by
the way, returns ’Ome forthwith, under a new manage-
ment.
Young Edwin Geach, who has been looking after things
for George Rignold on tour, will lake Mesmeibt Kennedy
through Maoriiand. It is sad to find genial, level-headed
agents, I.ke Lohr and Geach, identified with the awful
Kennedy. Tub Bulletin suspects that the Professor
fixes ’em with his deplorable eye and stiffens their
consciences.
In England, the other day, a youth of 18 years was
charged with vagrancy—sleeping out of doors. His
defence was that his master, a professional “hypnotist,”
had refused to pay him his wages. During the case it
came out that the shcwman’s subjects were never hypno-
tised into anaesthesia; that they felt pain when needles
and pins were stuck into them, hut repressed all outward
symptoms of it; that they oidy swallowed and kept
down those horrible mixtures by force of will, and were
often very sick afterwards ; that they simply were pain-
bearers for wanes. This lad, it also turned out, had lain
for ttiree days in a pretended trance, with his mouth
sewn up, though really awake and in pain.
Ada Cavendish, the original New Magdalene, died re-
cently. In her best day she was a fine actress and a
flourishing manageress—launched, it was understood, by
Lord Londesborough.
Two Adelaide-born young men, brothers
(one of them served his articles in Sydney), have
cleaned up their Westralian speculations for
.£160,000. Not scrip, but pood yellow sovereigns.
The aboriginal king of the Edwards river,
N.S.W., has married a white girl, Miss Mary
Violet Forster, the cook at Maroco station, where
His Majesty Cobbey was employed as rouseabout
and assistant-cook. Many great men now marry
cooks—but the bride is generally some other
fellow’s cook.
In a Sept, number of Reynolds’s News-
paper appeared, under a big heading, a story by
Louis Becke entitled “The Obstinacy of Mrs.
Tatton.” Becke’s name was appended, but Rey-
nolds’s did not mention that the story was written
for and appeared in The Bulletin some months
ago. The Sketch, a fashionable London illus-
trated, also reprints from The Bulletin, without
acknowledgment, a Becke story, “Kennedy the
Boat-Steerer.”
Sheridan, the condemned abortionist,
whose nerve seems to have quite broken down,
was an insatiable cigarette-smoker. Whether
cigarettes primarily and specially conduce to
nerve-mischief, or whether nervous subjects smoke
cigarettes with the idea that they are less harmful
than the pipe or cigar, is a problem ; but certain
it is that the most tremblingly-nervous of all
smokers—it may almost be said of all human
beings—is the cigarette-glutton.
No Acting-Judge should ever take a case
which the prosecuting Attorney-General has
declared to be so indissolubly intermixed (so far
as he, the A.G., is concerned) with political and
personal considerations that he doesn’t want to
have any more to do with it, on the ground
that a lot of people are imputing to him
undue bias. For the Acting-Judge, who pre-
sumably is, after all, only human, is, or may
be, dependent for his promotion to per-
manent rank on the favor of the Attorney-General
aforesaid. Acting-Judges, like Attorneys-General,
are men of high character and unchallengeable
integrity ; nevertheless they are but mortal, and
in the highest court of the land questions of good
taste cannot be too carefully considered.
Lovely woman again ! A woman with her
head swathed in bandages was assisted into the
witness-box at a Sydney police-court the other
day and made the following remarkable recanta-
tion : “Your Worship, I made a mistake. It
was not him (prisoner), but the man I live with
who did it, and I can’t prosecute my man.”
Accused then left the dock. He had been a spec-
tator of the row between the couple, in which the
man brutally broke a bottle, over the woman’s
head. His punishment was 36 hours in the cells,
bail having been refused at the instance of the
police.

A Chapter on Corsets .
France, the head centre of Fashion, is contem-
plating some kind of restrictive legislation in con-
nection with that interesting item of female attire
—the corset. In France, where wasp-like waists
havS long been the vogue, there can be no doubt
that the abuse of the corset has produced mischiev-
ous results. With the ladies of the British race,
however, the corset still retains its popularity ;
and in the majority of cases it is used more for
purposes of general support than for the unnatural
contraction of the waist. In these instances the
use of the corset is doubtless beneficial. Badly-
shaped and ill-fitting corsets will, however,
always injure the figure of the wearer and prove a
menace to health. But ladies need only use some
discretion in purchasing, to avoid these outrages
n art. The best makers, in endless variety, and
at all prices, may be obtained from Messrs. Man-
ning and Co., Ladies’ Outfitters, on The Block
Collins-street, Melbourne.*
Much restriction was placed upon the sea-
men of the Cristoforo Colombo during her stay in
Maoriland waters, owing to the many desertions
in Melb. and Sydney.

National Australia,
The time will soon be ripe for the head-pieces of
the different colonies to study this subject.
“National Australia” is bound to come, and the
politician who takes the initial step will be for-
tunate. Federation leagues and Federal councils
have hitherto been failures because all the colonies
had not one common subject to agree upon, but
since the B. L. Corto Rothschild Cigars have been
on the market, all this is changed. These famous
smokes are acknowledged all over the world to be
unrivalled for 6d., and are now obtainable at all
first class tobacconists. Ask for the B. L. Corto

Sydney,
December 3, 1895.
My Dear Moorabinda—
There were no extra frills on the part of the
A.J.O, to signalise Gov, Hampden’s maiden trip
to Randwick. The sacred enclosure, with its
smoking-room sort of furniture, was glorified with
a few potted plants—though perhaps this absence
of decoration was a subtle compliment to the V.R.
girls who occupied the enclosure. Distance cer-
tainly lends enchantment to these ladies, who,
when seen close up and by daylight, are not so
pretty as when seen from afar off, but they look
jolly girls at any range, and don’t all dress alike
dla china ornaments. The only things they seem
unanimous about are crossing one knee over the
other when they’re sitting down and wearing
white complexion-veils. Also, they all wear hair-
nets and plait their waving tresses into the same
onion-shaped knot.
Perhaps because the first vice-regal race-meeting
was a very off “by-meeting,” the vice-regal dress-
ing looked rather uneonsidered. The eldest Y.R.
damsel wore a fawn suit with a pinkish collar;
the second, a navy-blue suit faced with white
moire, and a hat trimmed with sulphur gauze and
wings ; and the third, a cream serge skirt, with
blouse of pale-blue pompadour silk, coarse straw
hat trimmed with cream ribbon and marguerites.
The vice-regal maidens were the objects of much
surreptitious staring on the part of the youths;
at all times there was a semi-circle of all sorts and
conditions of men in front of the Governor’s box
sizing up the new-comers, and every man who
passed had his eye on the corner. But I was
amused at the stealthy way all this was done.
Men have ever so much more natural shyness
than women; when a woman wants to inspect
anybody she just gets into a good position and
focusses her hypnotic glare, no matter who
wriggles. Miss Darley, with cornflowers in her
hat, was of the vice-regal party.
Gov. Hampden sensibly sported the first straw
I have ever seen on the vice-regal head on a race-
day. It was a weary-looking hat, too, showing
signs of wear-and-tear, and it may interest the
johnnies—who blazed forth in hat-bands and
scarves of H.E.’s colors directly they found out
what they were—to know that his Ex. doesn’t
wear ’em himself, but sports a dark-blue ribbon
on his topping-off. And, with the Governor free-
and-easy in a straw hat, the spectacle of an old
man of many shekels, who was introduced en
camarade into the Gov.’s box, and, while there,
proceeded to fill a short clay pipe, didn’t seem
much out of place after all. This elderly Croesus
will give the new Governor a strange notion of
Australian plutocracy, for he wore a Bradfield-
check grey suit of faded hue, a tall and veteran
white hat, riding boots and spurs. The suite
were all straw-hatted, too, and the only conven-
tionally-dressed man on the lawn was the hand-
some Capt. Dangar, who still appears to consider
himself aide-de-camp to the ex-acting Governor’s
family.
There were very few on the stand. A
Sydney matron wore a spring-green crepon skirt,
with the front buttoned up in a flap, and a green
silk blouse pompadour in pink ; Mrs. Allison was in
a dark skirt with a rose-pink satin blouse slashed
with white satin and a Gee-Gee sort of toque ;
Miss Sylvia Darley was dressed d la Blanche
Massey”; and a black gown with beetles’ wing
embroideries had a good effect. But really the
members’ was a howling wilderness, and the
grand-stand little better. Still, people tell you
solemnly what a good “gate ” a Governor makes.
Society has of late been massed at the Thirl-
mere Hospital Fair, which opened at Sydney Ex-
hibition Building last Thursday with Gov. and
Lady Hampden and three daughters and most of
the suite and a flourish of trumpets generally.
Lady H. bought lots of things and burdened the
staff with so many nic-nacs that one of them at
least looked like an understudy to Mrs. Plunkett’s
heavily-laden Xmas tree. Lady Hampden has a
very fashionable figure, and so was well-fitted in
bottle-green silk crepon with sleeves of pompadour
silk and trimming of flat black satin bows ; a sort
of bib of cream muslin at the neck, the bonnet
she landed in, and a big complimentary bouquet
of pink roses. Lady H. scrutinised the stalls
through long-handled pince-nez and wore her hair
in a plaited knob with a net over it. She did not
wear a veil, and her amiability was a well-
sustained effort quite up to the most popular vice-
regal standards.
Her three daughters were not dressed to kill.
Also, the Gov.’s boutonniere was one of the
smallest things of the sort I have ever seen. One
of H.E.’s experiences at the fair was to be bailed-
up by a pretty girl carrying “ Hampden biscuits’’
in a heart-shaped box, who insisted on his
purchasing his name-sake pastry, though there is
no authentic record that His Ex. ate it afterwards.
It fell to the Governor’s lot to open the bazaar,
which he did in a speech that showed much his-
torical research on the part of the private-secre-
tary ; while Lady H.—who was billed roper f 'w>
simply stood and smiled. Evidently Lady Hampj
den isn’t in the habit of unlimbering her sou 1
d la “M.E.J.”
The Thirlmere bazaar must go down to posterity
ns one of the best arranged, brightest, and most
fashionable fairs ever held in Sydney. The stall-
holders, beginning with Mrs. Hutton, were mostly
called from the top of the social basket, and a
scion of acting vice-royalty carried a tea-tray in
one of the refreshment-rooms without spilling very
much. The stalls were most artistically arranged,
and the pecuniary side was well worked up, the
gallery-rails being lined with advts., which gave a
business-like air to the fanciful arrangements.
It was, in short, the sort of show that ought to
get its photo, taken to establish the record for
future fair-organisers. Prices were moderate,
too, and the committee was not too high-toned to
sell pork and boned roosters and underclothing.
Asa rule, everything you don’t want is what you
buy at a fair, and it was possibly a suspicion that
squeaking dolls and babies’ boots would be the
sole display, as usual, that led to such a thin
attendance of men on both of the days I was
present. And, consequently, there was a gloom
over the cigar and cigarette stall, principally run
by a Sydney belle. Evidently the golden youth
of Sydney are not allured by the prospect of hav-
ing their cigarettes lit by a society beauty or their
button-holers pinned in under the same remark-
able circumstances.
Madame Henry, the presiding genius of the
Cercle in Sydney, organised a dramatic
and musical entertainment in the Oddfellows’
Temple on the 26th ult., with an imposing list of
titles in the front seats and a large audience to
back them up, though it was on a wet and dismal
evening. Two French plays, “Le Secret de la
Marquise, on les Deux Meres,” brightly written
by Mme. Henry, who had a treble recall and
many flowers at its conclusion ; and “L’Rtincelle,”
were both acceptably rendered by the members of
the circle, who talk with a diminishing Austra-
A PERFECT SYSTEM.
CUSTOMER : “Can't you wait upon me? I’ve been here for nearly an hour. A
pig's liver, please."
BUTCHER: “Sorry, hut there's three or four ahead of you. Surely you don't
want your liver out of order!”
Han accent every time you go to hear them.
Music and dancing diversified the programme,
which was a great success on very high-toned
lines.
Next Thursday evening an original comic-opera,
“Club Life,” music by Ernest Truman and book
by “Banjo” Paterson, will make its first appear-
ance on any stage. The bats and owls are to be
huntvdoutof the cosy, long-empty Criterion theatre
for the occasion, and Gov. Hampden is to uprear
his helid in the front row. Also, people who have
had a whiff of the opera beforehand go into
ecstaoies at the mention of it. Every dress-circle
seat has been sold, and most of the stalls have been
trad,ed off at ss. apiece. Also, the ladies’ chorus
will comprise some of the handsomest and nicest
of Sydney’s womankind.
There seems to be a deluge of new music. From
the French musical depot I have received a pretty
copy of Kowalski’s latest work, “ Menuet
Regence.” The minuet is solemn and rather un-
bending, and may be played with facility, which
makes the printed fingering of some of the passages
rather superfluous. It is dedicated to Miss Etfie
Lees. From W. H. Paling and Co. comes the
“Carbine” Schottische, by Sylvia Blackstone,
mysteriously dedicated to the Chief Justice and
Lady Darley, who never go to the races when they
can possibly help it, and have never been known
to schottische. The “ Carbine ”is a lively dance-
tune that anvbody could hop to. The “ Clematis
Waltz” by B. B. Haugh, dedicated to Lady
Griffith, is a merry fragment which keeps on
repeating itself, as if it were a musical indigestion,
and the “Sydney Waltz,” by Josephine Farrelly,
has for its only recommendation that it isn’t
boldly dedicated to Card. Moran. “The Little
Donah ” Polka, by Ansell Hope, is a common
sort of tune, adorned, more or less, by the portrait
of a girl with sausage curls and her mouth open,
who looks as if she had just seen a ghost.
Three new local songs are “ All the Grief is
Mine ” by Linda Prince, “ A Song of the Rhine ”
and “Can You Forget” by C. C. Betbune. The
first is rather sing-song, requiring a good singer to
make anything of it; the second is a dainty, love-
lorn retrospection with a prettv vocal passage on
“ ah,” which gives a barcarolle effect; but the
third ditty is unutterably flat and insipid in both
words and music. These two last come from
Nicholson & Co.
Apropos of music: that talented pianiste,
Madame Charbonnet Kelierman, left for a four
months’ holiday in France last week, accompanied
by her little son. Her many pupils presented her
with various valuable souvenirs, and her cabin on
the day of departure was half-hidden with flowers.
There are no cleverer self-advertisers in the
whole world than florists. Births, marriages, and
deaths have no sacredness in their eyes ; a corpse
is only a good knob to hang the latest thing in
bouquets on, with the florist’s flag well displayed
so that society maidens may order similar collec-
tions of vegetables for the next ball ; and even the
Queen of England is worked for all she is worth
by the dealers in green-stuff. Only the other
month some frozen Australian flowers were sent
to the Widow, who panned out at once into a
glorious advt.; and now another Sydney florist
has just got a whole cable to himself because he
froze some purple water-lilies and packed ’em off
to Royalty, regardless whether Her Gracious got
chilblains on her nose from smelling ’em in ill-ad-
vised ecstacy or not. Really it is the easiest thing
in the world to get Royalty to write up your shop
for you.
When you come to look things square in the
face, Royalty is not much more than a sort of lord
high sandwich-man advising the nation to use so-
and-so’s soap or something. Take the Prince of
Wales, for example. Because the English silk-
manufacturers want to revive trade, “ Tummy ”
has to accentuate the always prominent organ
which has led to his nick-name with gaily-
patterned silks which are not the most becoming
things for a man of his figure. But if he jibbed
at silk waistcoats, what a howl would go up from
the loyal British nation ! However, H.R.H. is
not going to jib, but has trotted like a lamb;
so I suppose silk vests may now be considered
the latest caper.
David Jones and Co. have had a window-full of
bloomers lately, and if the drapers had their way
we should all be new women on wheels. The
wicked daily-paper reporters have been looking
in that window, and find the bloomer costume
“very neat and modest-looking,” but the fact
that the V.R. girls cycle in skirts will keep
society from looking like the ballet yet awhile, in
spite of the provocation given by the admiring
press, which cannot be so married as it looks or it
wouldn’t try to encourage an all-round leg-show.
Unlike Lady Brassey, Lady Hampden ordy looks
on at the cycling and, so far, lias not joined her
flying family in their morning “scorchers” round
Centennial Park.
The steed with the iron tail is all the go guber-
natorially, and certainly if all women rode as
correctly as the V.R. women there wouldn’t be so
much the matter with lady cyclists from a purely
spectacular point of view. There is all the differ-
ence between Daisy Bell a I’Australienne and
these imported pedlars of high degree. For one
thing, the local article bends double on her bike—
going up hill she suggests a flying-fox nailed to the
mast, or something of the sort. I have always
thought that this spatch-cock effect was unavoid-
able, but vice-regal methods —here and in Mel-
bourne—show that all this hump back business is
quite unnecessary. Guvmentouse on its gridiron
looks as if it may break but cannot bend. It is
the correct thing to sit your bike as yon sit your
gee-gee.
The New Man has been discovered at Bourke
(N.S.W.). At a bazaar held to give a leg-up to
some hungry church or other in that parched and
dusty region, there were prizes for the best hat
trimmed by a gentleman, and the best sewing on
of six buttons by a gentleman. Evidently it is
being deemed expedient —even in the wilderness —
to break young men in to the domestic virtues so
that in case a New Woman marries one of them
he will not make home a misery to her through his
never having learned to sew. The woman suffra-
gists in Sydney really ought to start sewing-classes
for the benefit of the New Man.
And, really, the new woman is getting beyond a
joke. I see that the Tasmanian panjandrums
have authorised a woman—a Miss Brown—to
celebrate marriages—take the blushing particulars
of how the last little red infant came to town, and
have the crowning joy of stating in glaring figures
what the late poor Miss Frisky’s real age
amounted to. Miss Brown, in a word, is deputy
registrar, and she united her third couple the
other day. The idea of a woman uniting couples
is distinctly new—all most women do is to sepa-
rate ’em. Fortunately for Miss Brown’s natural
maiden modesty, the marriage rite as performed
by registrar is quite a humdrum take-it-for-
granted-you-know-what-you’re-doing sort of cere-
mony in which nobody yaps for hours in a wooden
voice on subjects they would be arrested for allud-
ing to outside a church ; but William takes Nancy
in plain, respectable English and the rest is quite
their affair. It must require great strength of
character, though, for a spinster to be constantly
marrying other spinsters to adoring swains and
learning the ceremony by heart just to expend
her eloquence on other people. It won’t be Jong
before that Tasmanian deputy registress is facing
the nuptial music “ on her own,” I’ll bet a bodkin.
The Primate’s garden-party to Lord and Lady
Hampden was a most forlorn affair. The weather
was wet, and the vice-regal party, on arrival, were
carried off upstairs by the host and hostess—
either to have a few words of prayer or to write
their names in birthday-books, while the rest of
the guilded guests were left to fight their way
through the dense crowd to the reception-room.
The chief topic of conversation was the wicked-
ness of the daily press, which, much to the vexa-
tion of Miss Smith and the Bishop, printed their
names as having been present “at some R.C.
party.”
Some pedestrians on St. Kilda-road, the other
Sunday, saw a neat little dispute between Pedigree
and Oof represented by Mrs. and Mr. Brassey.
While they were walking into church adust-storm
came up, and the Gov. hailed the first cab he saw
—a fearful old caravan with a wonderful horse.
The cabby was so excited that he could not get his
hearse turned in time to prevent a natty hansom
driving in between him and the vice-royalty.
Then the sport began. “Shure, yer beautiful
Ladyship, didn’t yer Highness call me, and isn’t
it me has the iligant eab ready for ye? ” “ Cer-
tainly, and I’m not going in anything else.”
“ But, my dear, we simply cannot ride in that
vehicle when one so superior is available,” says
the Gov. The argument lasted about five minutes,
and the hansom man said never a word. He
simply kneiv he’d win, and he did, and the lady
consoled the old cabby with half-a-sov., which he
will probably exhibit in the same window as
Wallington’s letter thanking the man who sent
Gov. Brassey the dish of peas.
A very high-toned suburb has been much
amused by the complications that have arisen
through one of its residents, who was cast for
death by his doctors, renewing his lease of life.
Hunks’s money had secured him a wife about a
third of his own age, and, as the last service she
could render him, she ordered the most expensive
mourning outfit that a fashionable draper could
supply. It was not required, and the ragman
agreed to keep it on the shelf till it should be
wanted. But one day, intentionally or by accident,
the bill came in. When Hunks redivivus learned
how thoughtful his wife had been, he had a
relapse; and when a few days afterwards he
received the coffin account, he became delirious.
Both man and wife are still alive and kicking;
and at least one of the parties is afraid that by
the time the weeds are wanted they will be out of
fashion.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

The sentiment which dictated the recent
much-discussed invitations to all creeds and
parties to meet Card. Moran and the Catho-
lic hierarchy, in Sydney Town Hall, is, in as
far as it is intelligible and praiseworthy, identical
with that which has initiated and maintains the
public-school system of primary education. The
operating principle is the Liberal one which says
that the more people know of one another and
mix with another, independent of the accident of
creed, the better citizens will they be, and the
more free from prejudice and superstitious dis-
likes; and everything which justifies the employ-
ment of the principle for a gathering such as the
Cardinal’s, infinitely more strongly justifies it in
gatherings where minds are plastic and unformed.

Melb. Philharmonic Society performed the
oratorio, “Israel in Egypt,” the other night, and
Lord and Lady Brassey (already known as “ the
pair of Braces ”) dropped in just as the singers
were wrestling with the chorus, “ Egypt is Glad.”
Instantly the melodious loyalists shut off the
sacred whoop, and (the artistic fitness of things !!)
left Egypt in its ecstasies whilst they yelled the
National Anathema —thus leading the audience
to believe that that noxious tune was one of the
plagues of Egypt a theory which The Bulletin
lias long maintained. The Argus took the Society
gravely to task for its action, and intimated that
under such circumstances the performance should
never be started until the vice-regal party is
securely seated. But why not hire a little boy to
meet their Excellencies and suite out on the mat,
and toot “God Save” to them through a fine-
tooth comb?

At a late sittings of Melb. divorce-
court a petitioning wife alleged as her husband’s
cruelty that he never washed himself, that on his
own statement he had not done so for 50 years,
and that he said he was now too old to learii.
One of the “best”
families in Maoriland a
family noted for its pretty
women—Las a strong dash of
Oreole blood. Some of the
males, though, are almost
coon-like in the woolliness
of their locks and the sallow-
ness of their skins. A scion
of this family is married to
an enormously wealthy half-
caste girl. “Confound it,”
said a military relative of the
prospective bridegroom,
when he was told of the en-
gagement, “ we’ve been five
generations trying to breed
out our black blood, and
you must give it a fresh start
by marrying blawsted
Maori woman.” ,
A peculiarity of the Maori
half-castes, which is certainly
not shared by other hybrids
(as, for instance, the Eurasian
and the Creole), is their pride
in their colored ancestry. No
amount of education or “ re-
finement ” seems to make
them ashamed of their stout
old Ngapuhi or Ngatimania-
poto lineage, and no doubt,
when the last Maori shall
be gathered to his fathers,
and no memory of that brave
race remains but the faint,
bronzed tint on a passing
cheek, genealogies will be
proudly traced b»«k to the
age when myth and history
blended, when Mokoia, laved
by Rotorua’s blue waters,
was the Maori Olympus,
when the beauteous Hine-
moa, summoned by the magic
lute of Tutanekai, swam,
Leander-like, to meet her
lover, when Tohutu exter
minated the sea-pigmies—
aye, even back to the days of Maui, who, as
everybody knows, fished Maoriland from out the
depths of Ocean.

Kanakaland has no leper this week. But
two candidates are undet observation at Towns-
ville Immigration Dep6-.
* * *
Booth, the Geu’ral, made a deal of capital,
one way or another, out of his final meeting at
Melb. Town Hall. Chief Justice Madden being
in the chair, the Government House crowd came
along to take the shine out of that ex-acting
potentate, and, when the inevitable hat was cir-
culated, his Ex. led off with a donation of .£25. A
couple of hours later, Booth adjourned to the
Temperance Hall, where he waved his nervous
claws at the “penitent drunks” assembled, and
told them then were his real friends, his very own
people, his legitimate children, so to speak. “I’ve
just come from the swells,” said Booth. “ They’re
all very well in their way, very good people to get
money out of, and I cultivate them so that I can
help you—(approving hiccups from the penitents)
—for my heart is vvitli you, and they have their
own religious teachers.” The Gen’ral is a poor
hand at impromptu verse, or he would probably
have put the case in hymn form.
General Booth is almost as wild a tarradiddler
as the average temperance apostle who swears that
he always drank his twenty gallons of gin per
week until he saw a distiller struck dead by light-
ning, and was converted by the awful spectacle.
Booth paints his lurid, evil past with a large-sized
trowel. He had learned, he says, “ all the damn-
ing sins ”in early boyhood. “He was a forward
youth,” and if he had held on to his phenomenal
career of dissipation, he would have “filled a
profligate’s grave, broken his mother’s heart, and
gone to hell before he teas 21.” These yarns offer
no encouragement to commonplace decency and
manliness as far as The Bulletin can discover.
If you want to grow into a flourishing evangelist
you must begin by being 25 times more of an
unbridled ass than any ordinary young man. So
with the girls. A Harmy meeting is not at all
suitable to a warm-blooded virgin’s constitution.
“Oh, my sisters,’’ shrieks Converted Jane from
the platform, “ I was ever so much worse than
you, and now, thank the Lord ! I’m ever so much
better.” The occasional result is that a saucy
sister lets her golden hair go hanging down her
back, and is ever so much worse than before, with
the vaguely pious intention of feeling better soon.
• • •
Geu’ral Booth declares that some of the
“ finest ” officers in his Harmy were converted
when in a beastly state of intoxication —“ so
drunk that they had to be carried to the repent-
anoe-form.” There is more truth than fiction in
the aged warrior’s poor breast. No sober person
was ever brought to that form by the Harmy’s
raw spiritual methods. Everybody at every
Salvation meeting gets drunk, more or less. Booth
and his most zealous adherents live in a chronic
condition of religious D.T.’s :
The Salvationists at “Gen.” Booth’s Mel-
bourne meetings made desperate efforts to convert
the reporters. After every meeting a “lieutenant’ 1
or a “ major ” made for the press table, addressed
the scribes as “dear brothers,” and asked them
were they saved. One bounder, in a red-and-
yellow sash, who confessed on the platform to
having once been a swearer, a drunkard, a seducer,
and all the other things necessary to salvation,
immediately after went up to a lean, lanky, top-
hatted, taciturn scribe of the typical Argus sort
with, “ Oh ! beloved brother, I was once as wicket 7
Miss ALICE LEAMAR
as you are, but my soul has now been bathed in
blood and made clean.” ‘‘Your nose will be
bathed in blood and made dirty if you talk to me
like that,” said the Argus man.

Dear Bulletin, —Re your
remarks on adjudication of puta-
tive father before birth of child
and the alleged advantages of the
oasli-on-delivery system : Maori-
land law enables any unmarried
woman, who can prove that the
father of her prospective child is
about to leave the country or the
place where she lives, and has
made no adequate provision for
the future maintenance of the
child when born, to have him
adjudged its putative father in
anticipation, and ordered to find
surety not to leave without pro-
viding adequate means of main-
tenance for his unborn child, and
also that lie will pay birth-ex-
penses. In default, the happy
father (in posse) of the infant that
may never appear, and which if it
does arrive won’t have a father in
the eye of the law, may get six
months’ hard. Maoriland, too,
last year by the Legitirnisation
Act enabled the parents of an
illegitimate child to legitimise it,
and give it all the rights of a child
born in wedlock by their subse-
quent marriage and registration
of the child as their lawful issue
with the registrar of births. It is,
therefore, possible in M.L. for an
illegitimate child to have three
fathers —
1. Its putative father, who has to pay
for a child which the law says has no
father, and of which said law won’t
give him custody.
2. If its parents marry and legitimise
it, then its puiative father becomes in
the eyes of the law its real father.
3. It may be adopted and have an
adopted father.
And then, at the end of it all,
it may turn out that the mother
had lied, and the child’s actual
natural father may turn up to
further complicate matters.—
Wahine.

Australia and America are the two Eng-
lish-speaking countries where Judges are en-
couraged to gad around outside the legal circle
and make themselves chummy with all sorts of
“ representative persons.” Hence they are the
two countries where it is specially difficult to run
a representative person into gaol. One day it
mav dawn upon Australia that the administration
of justice has been gradually coming into con-
tempt ever since their Honors began to cultivate
the acquaintance of function-makers. A Jabez
JBalfour in Melbourne, for example, would be
rubbing shoulders with one Judge or other at a
public meeting, a blessed banquet, or a founda-
tion-stone laying at least once a week. Jabez, in
England, gets 14 years.

In Sydney, Xmas has now resolved itself
into an annual exhibition of Japanese industry
and skill. This year few city grocers and confec-
tioners have failed to stock their shops with dainty
Jap. goods, notably quaint little fancy-boxes, which
distance even Germany in trickiness and elaborate
(cheap) industry. The Japs appreciate space-
value, and cram every sq. in. of box with wooden
tooth-picks. One confectioner tells how he has
received enough tooth-picks this season to keep
him in firewood right through summer.

Well might Windeyer, J., say the other
day : “ On the evidence, this is the worst (divorce)
case I have ever tried.” The female petitioner
deposed, amongst other things :
He seized me bv the throat and throttled me, until I
was nearly insensible. ... He threatened to shoot
me and then commit suicide. He presented a loaded gun
at me with the hammer up, but I ran out of the house.
His kicking me was a daily occurrence. For a
ion- period, I never had any proper sleep ; he would
either kick me out of bed or slap my face just as I was
eoing off. He declared he would deprive me of sleep till
I went mad. . . . Once he kicked me and a child out
of bed on to the floor. I went to lie down with the chil-
dren but he made me come back by threatening to kick
my inside out. . . . After I had gone to sleep, he
kicked me out of bed again. I made up a bed on the
floor. He dashed a bucket of water over me, and
threatened to jump on me if I didn’t come to bed. I re-
turned to bed, and, when he thought I was asleep, he got
a razor and threatened to cut my throat, declaring he
would say that I did it myself. I jumped up and ran
away.
And so on. The value of the petitioner s evidence
may be read, according to taste, by the light of
her subsequent remarkable statement — 1 never
spoke angrily to him in my life.’

It is improbable that Sydney Ladies’ Club
will survive beyond February, owing to internal
dissensions not unconnected with the irregular
manner in which a high officer was recently foisted
on the club.
Sweetmau, the Mount Rennie cabman,
who, after a 20 minutes’ trial in the roar of the
Mount Rennie blood-boom, was sentenced to 14
years’ gaol and 50 lashes (Judge Windeyer
£ xpress * d reffret that prisone r’s condition of health
precluded him from prescribing more) has been
released from gaol. The man’s sentence and trial
were unspeakably unjust, and will form a count
j n tlie long and heavy indictment which will ulti-
mately have to be faced by those who have done
so much to degrade the administration of justice
in Botany Bay.

The decision in the Sydney scholastic case
of M‘Kenzie v. Meares points another moral in
favor of definite, written agreements. The de-
fendant, a girls’-sehool proprietress, knowing
plaintiff’s kink, wrote, when engaging her for six
months, that “Theosophy must be banished to
thought-land.” In spite of this, when defendant
was installed, she attended real Theosophical
meetings and welcomed flesh-and-blood Theosophi-
cal male visitors. Consequence : Dismissal. The
jury, however, gave the Mahatma a verdict for
six months’ salary and board—a result which, in
daily-paperese, “ will doubtless be received witli
satisfaction in astral circles as far as Thibet.”

S.M. Herald quotes from a ’Frisco paper,
as a novelty, the news that the waitresses at
certain local restaurants are attired in bloomer
costume. A generation ago a public caterer,
“ Mick ” Hegarty, started a caffiin Bourlce-street,
Melb., where all the female attendants wore
bloomers. A quarter of a century ago he opened
a branch cafe in Market-street, Sydney, where all
his waitresses were similarly attired.

The moribund Vic. Institute of Journalists
has reduced its subscription by one-half and erased
all back debts in the hope of inducing its members
to pay up. Melb. reporters, however, jib at pay-
ing to a society which is dominated by the pro-
prietorial element, does nothing for the subscrip-
tions it takes, and has certainly failed in its
flaunted object of “ raising the status of the pro-
fession.” The best way of raising said status is to
raise salaries ; the rank-and-file newspaper man’s
salary is rarely more and often less than that of
the mere artisan.

The soldier A.D.C. of one of the new

the local Patman club. He lately pinned one gay
and festive old hoy, “on his word and honor as a
gentleman,” to a promise that he would do him
an inexpensive little favor. The favor, it proved,
was to read a certain number of verses of Scrip-
ture every morning. Now the victim, who values
his word, wants to know how he can get out of it.

Under the heading, “ The Sister Martyrs
of Kn Cheng,” it is stated that Mrs. Saunders
said to Canon Berry : “ I see now why I was not
allowed to go with the girls. If I had gone, too,
those letters would never have been written, and
their publication will result in increased effort for
the evangelisation of China.” It clearly follows
that if the girls had not been murdered the letters
would not have been published. So the Almighty,
in order to forward evangelisation, causes women
to be murdered, and thereby probably innocent
Chinamen to be executed. Here fatalism is ram-
pant and free-will nowhere.

Dear Bulletin, —I found the enclosed
“confession ” near the Cathedral Choir School in
Pitt-street, Sydney. It evidently forms part of a
choir-boy’s “dictation ” exercise. No more need
now for The Bulletin to point out that “ the
collection’s the thing,”— Ruthea :
The Governor is expected at the Cathedral next Sun-
day. When in Church it behoves and is incumbent upon
us to behave in a reverent and seemly manner and the
reason why we are particularly enjoined to acquit our-
selves adequately is because the presence of the Governor
and family attracts a large number of fashionable and
wealthy people who give liberally to the offertory. As we
are entirely dependent on the collections this makes a con-
“iderable difference in onr welfare) it is therefore advis-
able that an additional charm should be lent to the
service by our Reverent Demeanour.

It is about time the Australian papers
shut down on bogus Mexican horrors. When the
Yankee pressman invents a really glaring horror
he always locates it in Mexico, and then it is
cabled all over the world, and the Australian
daily paper Juggins takes it all in. Two recent
obvious samples are the alleged burning of ten
heretics by a Mexican judge, and the burning of a
boarding-school and thirty-two inmates by a pair
of boy incendiaries. S.M. Herald generally
SIMILAR.
HE: “ In one respect I’m like the rug I kneel on,”
SHE : “ How so?”
HE : “ Why, I’m always at your feet.”
SHE : “ Yes. I’m going to shake the rug soon.”
publishes these things now without comment, its
famous article on the execution of 130 Mexican
priests being still in its memory, but Sydney
D.T. spread itself on tin; subject of the alleged
Mexican judge and the ten burned heretics in a
truly awful fashion. ______

The English, Scottish, and Australian Bank,
which reconstructed in ’93, is now planning another re-
arrangement with its creditors. This institution made
the most vigorous and radical reconstruction of the lot.
It fixed one-fourth of its deposits for ever as 4 per cent,
debenture slock, and one-half it fixed permanently as in-
scribed deposit stock at 4£ per cent. Then it fixed the
remaining fourth at 4 per cent, to be repaid by instal-
ments between the years 1900 and 1905. It thus reflxed
all its money at an average of 4J per cent., and as it
hadn’t to accumulate any very large cash reserves for
repayment, it made a much better bargain, so far as the
immediate present was concerned, than the A.J.S., Com-
mercial of Sydney, North Queensland, Q.N.8., or Royal
of Queensland, and should, on the face of things, have
shown better profits than any of them. Also it reserved
power to pay off some of its deposit-money at its own
option, and it wrote off £765,000 of capital and reserves to
cover possible losses. Its reconstruction scheme was
alleged to be the moat scientific of the lot, nevertheless
there was a great lack of public enthusiasm about some of
its securities, and its 4J per cent, inscribed stock habi-
tually remained stranded at about 13s. or 13s. 6d.
The net profits for the year ending 30th June,
1894 - the first year of the reconstructed bank’s existence
—were £10,153, equal to about 1J per cent, per annum
on the then paid-up capital. For the year ending 30th
June, 1895, it appears from the scanty cable information
to hand that the loss has been about £16,000, which is a
rather serious state of things. The E. S. and A. is,
therefore, going through a dismally expensive process of
applying for a special Act of the Imperial Parliament
giving it power to reconstruct again, providing three-
fourths of its creditors assent. This awful circumlocution
is probably necessary under the provisions of the British
law, but as the bank, after it gets its Act, will presum-
ably have to go through the regular legal formalities in
Australia just the same, the cost promises to be some-
thing serious.
Under the new proposals, two-fifths (say
£360,000) of the 4 per cent, terminable deposits due in
1900-1905 are to be paid at once. This will get rid of a
part of the unprofitable cash on hand, and save £14,400 a
year in interest. The remainder (probably about £540,000)
will be converted into 4 per cent, debenture stock which
goes on for ever, so that there will be no necessity to
accumulate cash for repayment purposes. As for the 4J
per cent, inscribed stock, amounting to £2,056,000, it is
proposed to divide it into two equal parts, the bank to
pay 3 per cent, certain on one half, and on the other half
to pay 3 per cent, if the earnings allow. If the earnings
don’t allow, then this second half may receive 2 per cent,
or 1 per cent, or nothing at all. If the 3 per cent, is paid
all round it will still mean a saving of £30,840 in interest,
making the total saving to the bank about £45,000 a year,
and if, at any time, interest is wholly suspended on the
second half of the inscribed stock, the total saving will be
£75,000. If the bank earns enough to pay'the full 4£per
cent, on its inscribed stock it will have £20,560 to the
good, and of this one-half is to go to reserve-fund and the
other half towards the redemption of the 3 per cent,
deposits. Altogether the E.S. and A. is asking a great
deal, and if it can’t get through well on these terms its
condition must be pretty bad.
The E.S. and A. is a purely British concern,
and after all the language which the lofty Briton has cast
on Australian bank management its troubles make the
banker at this side of the water feel that he isn’t quite so
exceptional an ass as he thought he was.

The Australian Temperance and General Life
Office has added a moderately prosperous year to its un-
assuming record. The funds of the ordinary life branch
h ive advanced from £167,843 to £185,005, an increase of
t 17,000. Last year the increase was £lB,OOO, and the
year before £19,000, so the business keeps up only reason-
ably well. The premiums received were £31,370, being
about the same as the two previous years. The total ex-
p -uses, including £250 allowances for depreciation, are
£8133, equal to a fraction over 25 per cent, of the premium
income and a little more than 21 per cent, of the total
income—a pretty high percentage, though not the highest
in Australasia. The interest receipts (£6749) more than
cover the death claims. Said interest receipts, ‘by the
way, are £2BO below those of 1893, when the funds were
£35,000 less, which looks as if the depression had struck
this society’s investments pretty hard. Rather more than
one-third of the whole year’s interest is set down as either
a icrued or in arrear, but as the Temperance and
General follows the nefarious practice of lumping these
wo items together, it is impossible to say how much
interest is in arrear. As a rule, the heavier the arrears of
i iterest, the larger the proportion of the investments
which are doubtful or bad ; this is the only item by which
p ilicy-holders can judge of the safety or otherwise of
tn.eir funds, and even it,is by no means a reliable guide,
as, in the absence of a State audit, there is no indepen-
dent guarantee that part of the arrears are not lumped in
with the mortgages. Still, the arrears, despite the want
of any independent assurance as to their accuracy, are a
more or less instructive item, and this process of disguis-
ing them is wholly objectionable.
Some good features about the Temperance and
General are that the “outstanding and accrued interest’’
is less than it was in either ’94 or ’93 ; and that the society
has created a small reserve fund of £2343—a painfully
small reserve and equal, to only £1 ss. 6d. per cent., but
still better than nothing. Considering, however, that
nothing seems to have been written off the freehold
properties or the investments during the last three
years of depression, it seems eminently probable that
this reserve will require to be considerably augmented.
Also, though the premium income is a little less than last
year, the expenses are a little more. Altogether, though
there is nothing very bad actually visible in the accounts,
there is nothing to call for any special enthusiasm just at
present.

The Port Jackson S.S. Co. has made a call of
6s. per share (equal to £6000), and if the shareholders
respond—people whose £3 shares are unsaleable at Id.
don’t respond very freely, as a rule—the co. proposes, it
is believed, to reduce the return fare to Manly from the
present 3d. to 2d. or Id., and argue the case out with the
new co. till the Day of Judgment. Meanwhile the bless-
ings of unlimited competition are falling very heavily on
Manly. All the rowdyism and brutalism of Sydney
swarms down there on holidays ; a good proportion of it
gets there on Saturdays and Sundays also, but on public
holidays Manly is a place that no decent person cares to
go to. Moreover, the economies involved in carrying
passengers 14 miles for 3d. are creating other difficulties-
The captains of the Manly boats work a minimum of
12 hours per diem and a maximum of almost any
number of hours, and they, or some of them, begin to
find themselves dozing off at the wheel now and then as
they steer the load of frantic competition up and down
the harbor. And some night a captain will doze off
altogether just as he is turning into Circular Quay, and
will have a beautiful dream of Paradise and rest and no
more threepenny fares, and then he will waken to find
himself piling his fast and commodious steamer on top of
the North Shore ferry-boat, and there will be a whoop
and a shriek and 500 curses and a gurgle, and a sudden
gathering of sharks, and finally an inquest. And after
that the Legislature will suddenly think of applying the
8-hour principle to the ferry-service, and the Cabinet will
agree to consider the matter as soon as Attorney-General
Want comes back from his fishing-excursion. “Awful
Harbor Accident—soo People Drowned I ” It must come,
sooner or later.

The Vic. Companies Act Amendment Bill,
which provides, among other things, for the writing-off
of lost capital, has gone overboard among the unfinished
business of the session. Therefore, the balance-sheets of
two Melbourne banks will presumabb' continue to state
that the assets are so much subject to losses which are to
be written off when the bill passes, and the amount of
these losses, instead of being debited to profit and loss,
will be kept dark as heretofore. This doesn’t, matter so
much in the case of one of these two banks, which could
write off half of its advances and still survive, but the
other isn’t situated that way, and some people concerned
want to know the worst. Other people concerned don't
want to know anything, reckoning that they are a great
deal happier as they are.

Melbourne Leader now estimates the wheat-
crop of Victoria for this season at 6,000,000 bushels. This
is 1,250,000 bushels less than the consumption and the
first deficit in 23 years. The average for several years
past has been about 14,000,000 bushels, and the present
is the smallest yield since 1877. In proportion to acreage,
it is the smallest since 1804.

The Vic. Government reckons, after careful
investigation, that beet-sugar can be produced in Victoria
with white labor quite as cheaply as the Kanaka-grown
cane-sugar of Queensland. It proposes to advance
£lOO,OOO for mill construction purposes. When Federa-
tion arrives, the Vic. beet-sugar will have to compete
against the Queensland cane with no local protective
tariff to support it, and if it fails to do so, the State’s
£lOO,OOO will be mostly lost, so the Turner Government
is betting heavily on white labor as against the cheap and
reliable Kanaka.

In Melb. recently, an industrial life assurance
co. successfully resisted a miserable little death-claim of
£lO or so. The insured, according to the evidence, died,
a month after his proposal was accepted, of chronic con-
sumption ; he was apparently incurable at the dale of the
insurance, but his disease was not mentioned in the pro-
posal and the co. didn’t find it out—though it should have
been sufficiently obvious—on its own account. It was not
alleged that he filled up the proposal himself; apparently
the agent filled it up, and possibly the insurer never had
any distinct idea wdiat was in it, or W’hat he was swearing
to. Very few people have distinct ideas about anything.
There seems to have been no medical examination,
but the superintendent looked at him and shoved him
through as a first-class life. This economical way of
doing things leaves all the responsibility on the
assured. The ordinary course of the cheap and
nasty form of life-insurance is somewhat as follows :
The agent asks an illiterate and unbusinesslike
man to insure. He fills up a paper at railroad speed, and
even if he reads the questions aloud to the insurer there
is no proof that they are understood. Also, it is by no
means certain that he always does read them aloud and
intelligibly. The insurer puts his name at the foot of the
document without reading it, and if it turns out when he
is dead that he had some serious disease at the date of the
proposal, and either didn’t know he had it, or didn’t men-
tion it to the agent, or the agent didn’t risk the loss of
his commission by putting it in the paper, and the state-
ments weren’t checked by any sufficient medical examina-
tion, the co. has a legal right to repudiate the contract.
The moral of which is that the insurance co., if it accepts
a life, should be legally bound to take all responsibility as to
the insurer’s physical condition at the date of acceptance,
and if it doesn’t have him properly'examined, or examined
at all, that should be its own funeral. A co. whose system
enables it to take a hopeless consumptive as a first-class
life deserves no sympathy when it tries to back out of the
consequences.

The law of mortgages, as it is in some of the
Australias, contains a proviso of which very few people
are aware. The mortgagee’s remedy is not only against
the property mortgaged, but against all the rest of the
debtor’s belongings ; when a man raises a loan of £lOO on
a piece of land he pledges along with it every other asset
in his possession, barring his soul. Therefore, a mort-
gagee may foreclose on a £6OO property for a £3OO mort-
gage, and through a temporary scarcity of competition
may buy it in for perhaps £l5O, and then may sell up the
rest of his debtor’s belongings to recover the other £l5O.
Cross, a Queensland Labor member, lately introduced a
Bill to provide that the mortgagee should have his
remedy only against the security specified in the bond,
but the House threw it out with such decision that it
bumped on every second stair in its exit.

Murray Smith, M.L. A., and Grimwood, M.L.C.,
have submitted a minority report against the Vic. Bank-
ing Commission Report. Smith and Grimwood object to
a Slate bank. They say that “ neither the convenience
and safety of the public nor the profit of the State will be
materially enhanced ”by a State note-issue. They go on
to give reasons, which- even the Argus rejects, to show
that the present bank-note system is good enough. Now,
the Bankers’ Conference, held in Sydney, represented the
banks of Australia, and decided, from the depths of bitter
experience, that the present system is not good enough
and it recommended a note-issue by a commission con-
stituted partly by the government and partly by the
banks. The notes which it recommended were to be
backed by a State guarantee to all intents and purposes—
only the banks were to make a bigger profit out of the
new issue than they do out of the present one, and to get
a certain am rant of State support gratis. It was a modest
conference and didn’t want much.
Paper money, of course, is not a specific for
financial rottenness and insolvency, although it is the
O’M. of one set of faddists, just as the Single-tax is the
O'M. of another. Lately, in Melbourne, the Single-tax was
put forward as the great preventive of capital punish-
ment, and the printing-machine is a sure maker of un-
limited money in the eyes of hundreds. Yet paper-money
has its functions. One or two of the reconstructed banks
closed their doors although they were solvent—their gold
was draining away, leaving them with good but, at the
time, non-liquid assets. At such a moment State-guar-
anteed paper-money would have averted the collapse and
saved much loss and panic. The Sydney conference of
bankers recognised this and provided for a special issue
of legal-tender notes at an emergency on deposit of 20
percent, of coin and pledge of Government securities for
the balance. The Vic. B inking Commission suggests an
emergency isspe pf notes in times of financial stringency
on approved securities and the united guarantee of the
banks requiring such assistance. The roll-call of the
Sydney conference was Finlaysou, Turnbull, F. G. Smith,
Law, Urquhart. Adams, Turner, Guthrie, Shields, Drury,
S anton, Dibbsy Hellioar, and French. It is against the
c nnbined experience of these men that Murray Smith
and F. U. Grimwood raise their respectable out-of-date
v >ices when they say the present system is ‘ good
enough.”

There is not now one line of business in Mel-

Before N.S.W. Parliament sits down to the
Study of Reid’s proposed new' Banking Bill, it should
table an imperative demand to have all unclaimed moneys
now lying in the hands of private banking corporations
paid over to the State Treasury. No one knows the
total of these unclaimed moneys, but some unreliable
estimates put the amount for all Australia as high as
£5,000,000, and, in that case, the N.S.W. balances must
be considerable. No valid reason can be given why this
money should not, like the unclaimed effects of intestate
estates, pass over to the public account. A Sydney
banker lately urged the banks’continued liability in the
event of a legal claimant turning up, but this liability
should and would be transferred to the State on the banks
surrendering the cash. The matter is so plain that
Parliament should take the first fitting opportunity to
insist on the surrender being made.

They have found the Junction Extended at
Broken Hill. Its nearest point appears to be within
about three-quarters of a mile of the Junction, but notin
the course which the lode is supposed to take—through
either the Junction North or New North. The most pro-
mising blocks used to be held by the Sultan Co.—now
only a boom time memory. The old plans show three or
four black marks across it, each supposed to represent a
lode parallel to the Broken Hill line, but after a w’hile the
show was pronounced hopeless and fell out of sight.
Nothing had indeed been ever got on it to warrant the
formation of a co.; but it happened to be within sight of
Broken Hill, and that was enough in those days. Since
then silver has fallen from about 4s. 6d. to 2s. 6|d. —not
that that makes any difference, though !
Of course, the Junction Extended is a Sydney
co. And such a co. ! The capital is £50,000, in
100,000 shares of 10s. each ; of these, 80,000 shares were,
it is alleged, offered to the public at 6d. on application
and 6d. on allotment; balance, as usual, in calls. Of the
£4OOO received, £3250 goes to vendors, with 20,000 shares;
and from the remaining £750 flotation and other expenses
are to be paid. The balance is to go to the credit of the
co.—say £250. With £250 this £50,000 co. sets to work
to prospect close upon 200 acres ! Moreover, it is a no-
liability co., so that not another penny need be paid up ;
and most likely not another p nny will be if the market
doesn’t hold up. Few people who know' the country and
know what deep-sinking costs (and deep-sinking must be
relied upon there) will ever believe that the primary
object of the co. is prospecting work. What The Bulletin
said a few weeks ago is capitally enforced by this case.
No co., it was affirmed, ought to be permitted registration
under the No-Liability Act unless, say, one-fifth of the
capital of the co. is actually available for the purposes of
prospecting or mining. In this case there is possibly no
more than l-200th of it so availaole.

Block 10 (8.H.) lias recommenced div.-paying—
Is. for Nov., £5OOO in all. On present going it ought
to have no difficulty in continuing this. Before the end
of the month the concentrating mill, to deal with 2000
tons of ore weekly, producing about 500 tons of concen-
trates, will be running. The profit on the ore disposed of
hitherto has amounted to slightly under 17s. per ton ; so
that, as the new plant will run a third cheaper than the
old, nothing: but a fall in silver to under 2s. per oz. should
stop the regular div. in future. In their half-yearly
report the directors estimate (upon their manager's
figures) that they have enough sulphide ore of over 16oz.
value between the 315 and 615 ft. levels to keep the new
plant running for 10 years. Last half-year the profits
(depreciation apart) amounted to over £13,000.
About the last of the prominent Howell men

One or two claims at Wyalong, writes a bilious

this doesn’t seem to benefit the place. Commission agents
could do a roaring trade here by trading off businesses,
which are now for disposal at alarming sacrifices—if they
could only get customers. The sole occupations of the
majority are swapping drinks *the blest only), empty
horse-talk, and snake-yarns. Most of the house-property
and shares in the best claims are held by lawyers, police-
men, money-lenders, publicans, and absentees. These, as
a rule, carefully neglect spending a penny more than
necessary on the field : they take turns to make trips to
Sydney, Melbourne, etc., coming back with red rims
round their eyes. These are the Blest. For the rest,
including the large number of deserving workers now
stranded there, Wyalong is simply Sheol.

The coming N.S.W. mining conference might
do worse than consider what is the equity of a case like
the Homeward Bound, and what would be the effect if a
foreign co. lost a mine in N.S.W. under similar circum-
stances? And, to put the thing bluntly, why on earth
in such cases should people who are practically jumpers
profit by the forfeiture of the lease? If a valuable lease
is forfeited, why should it not revert to Govt, and
be auctioned for what it will fetch for the benefit of the
Treasury ?

Victory (Pambula) tributor Tweedie has taken
a second parcel of ore (about 40 tons) to Sydney for
treatment. This parcel is supposed to be as rich as the
Falkner ore. Taken as it is from the same shoot and
right under F.G.M. Co.’s present workings, there is every
chance of it coming up to expectations.
* * * •
Falkner G.M. Co., Pambula, writes a Bulletin
correspondent, did not take out the £12,000 worth of gold
in the last seven months wdlh only four men. It is exactly
1H months since the co. began raising ore from the rich
patch struck by Harrison and O'Brien. In the two months
ending Jan. 26 these tw o men raised 9J tons of first-class
ore assaying 550 z. per ton ; value over £2OOO ; and about
20 tons of second-class ore besides. Since then it has
taken from 5 to 8 men 10 months to raise the other
£lO,OOO from stuff that certainly did not get poorer with
depth.
The generosity of the Falkner Co., continues
this correspondent, in giving the magnificent bonus of
£lO to its mining-manager for raising that £12,000
worth of gold is indeed startling. No one on the field
ever gave its credit for so much magnanimity—though
all local mine-owners and managers are agreed that the
co. might easily have given something almost equally
handsome to the two men who found the gold.

Block 14 directors, in their half-yearly report,

liquid assets at the end of Sept. w r ere £29,085, as against

year of £lO,OOO. Besides this, a mortgage of £l5OO has
been cleared off the Port Adelaide works, and payments
made for machinery extension ; so that, taking the
average run of expenses, and allowing for depreciation
and a moderate reserve, sixpence per share a month
ought to be within the powers of the co. There is more
likelihood, however, that the directors will get something
to reserve before dividing anything. This is the more
necessary because Block 14 has not the reserves of high-
grade sulphides that most of the others have, and upon
which they could fall back should the silver (metal)
market be struck by a panic and knocked senseless for a
while.

Australian produce, wrote The Bulletin’s
London correspondent by last mail, is just now fetching
enormous prices. New season’s butter is quoted at
(nominally—for there is little in the market)close on 180 s.
Mutton is nearly sd. per In., and lamb sella at 6d. Of
course these prices are due to exceptional circumstances,
the market being almost bare. What will happen in a
month or so, when shippers begin to send forward large
quantities of stuff, it would be rash to say.

W.A. Journalist Vosper, speaking at Cool-
gardie, gets back on the Murchison. “He had just re-
turned from an extended tour through some of the much-
vaunted squatting country, and a more God-forsaken,
miserable desert tract he had never had the misfortune
to behold. They knew the country between Kurnalpi
and Coo gardie, that it was not lovely, but it was a
parterre, a perfect paradise, compared to the mulga of
the north. He actually saw one station where there were
a million and a quarter of acres which supported 15,000
scraggy sheep—so poor that they were obliged to import
mutton from S. A. for use in a hotel on the run.”

From Kalgoorlie: “The water difficulty is
almost a thing of the past. The scare was created by the
condensers.” Apparently there is no water difficulty
while it can be got for less than a shilling a gallon.

SHEEP-FARMING—FUTURE PROSPECTS
In reviewing the future prospects for sheep-
farmers, the National Wool Company of Mel-
bourne takes a hopeful view of the situation.
It states that where producers have lost in the
lower standard values of our staple product a con-
siderable gain is secured in the extra weight cut
from the sheep of to-day; as, under the careful
system adopted of selecting and breeding, the
average animal now cuts about twice the weight
of wool the sheep of 30 years ago produced.
Again, Australia finds in Europe an unlimited
market for her mutton, and as breeders are rapidly
changing from the merino to sheep of larger
breeds, any depreciation in wool-values will be
amply recouped by the extra value of the carcase.
It is further anticipated that the country will
carry more of the crossbred sheep to the acre than
of merino from the fact that the latter, owing to
ts roving nature, destroys as much herbage as it
consumes.*

POLITICAL
POINTS
N.S.W. Premier Reid’s “man”—Labor
Chief M'Gowan.
Tasmanian rulers abhor the name of State
Socialism. Yet all TaS. hospitals are wholly sup-
ported by the State.
Unmack, ex-Minister for Q. Railways, has
been given “ a soft thing ” as Railway Arbitrator
—at lbs. a week, The Bulletin presumes.
To show how lightly the Q. Govt, regards
breaches of the Polynesian Labourers’ Act: a
well-known sugar grower, recently convicted three
times of illegally employing Kanakas, has been
gazetted a J.P.
In one month two successful conferences
between the Upper and Lower Houses of Parlia-
ment have been witnessed in Australasia —one in
Maoriland on the liquor question ; the other in
N.S. Wales on the question of direct taxation.
About the (politically) happiest man in Q.
Parliament is Callan, M.P. for Fitzroy. He
won’t stand again on account of health, and so—
his troubles about his constituents. Callan is
“ well in ” to both Mt. Morgan and Lake’s Creek.
Why doesn’t some democrat spare time to
introduce a Bill of one clause providing that no
criminal case shall be heard for more than (say)
six hours on any one day ? You don’t find civil
oases rushed far into the night. Refreshers, you
know.
There exists among the Mackay (Q.)
Kanakas a “ring” for purposes of mutual protec-
tion, and for the punishment of informers. The
judicial authorities are well aware of this, and,
consequently, clear the court of all Kanakas when
a Polynesian case comes on.
A mooted idea that the stipendiary magis-
tracy should be appointed by the Supreme Court
instead of by party Cabinets is only feebly argu-
able so long as the present system of political
Attorney-Generalism and contemned judioialism
obtains. The alternative is the popular election
of magistrates.
Chief Justice Madden’s brother, Frank, a
small man in a large parcel, is also of opinion that
the complete duty of woman is to be round*
and smooth, and plump. He declared in the
House, the other night, that it would be a
“terrible mistake ” to give women the suffrage,
for “ they desired amongst other things to abolish
soldiers and war, and to raise the age of consent
to 21.”
Dear Bulle-
tin, —Forthe last
few years Mil-
dura has been
agitating for a
railway—not that
a rail way running
through a wil-
derness, where
not so much as
an opossum-skin
can be picked up
would pay for
axle-grease, but
so that the pre-
sent holders of
land may be able
to sell out and
leave someone
else to take the
baby. A railway
to Mildura, with
rolling ■ stock,
would cost some-
thing like
.£400,000 say
.£lOO per head
of the popula-
tion. Is the pre-
sent anxiety that
Govt, should step
in designed to
bring about com-
plications with
the Chaff e y a ?
Certainly, if Go-
vernment in any
way exceeds its
powers under the
agreement, we
may expect to
see compensation
demanded. The
taxpayers will
need to keep a
close eye on Par-
liament when it
deals with the
affairs of Mil-
dura. Yours,
Vic.
According to Premier Reid’s Federation
Bill, when the Federal Constitution is drawn up
it must be approved of by the votes of 50,000
electors to become law. Query; Will the pro-
vince take sufficient interest in the matter to
raise 60,000 affirmative votes, especially if it is
wet on polling-day ?
So long as N.S.W. Opposition claims a
political camaraderie with the Legislative Council,
as opposed to the results of popular elections—no
matter how mixed the issues at, and how stupid
the results of, such elections—just so long it
courts an unreasoning hostility and deserves to be
locked out of office.
Four youths have been dismissed from the
S.A. Taxation Dept, for playing pitch-and-toss in
the basement during work-hours. Yet paid
M’sP. continually play cards in the committee-
rooms while the House is sitting, and there is
always a “ Cup-sweep ” got up in the Legislature
during working-hours.
Gov. Brassey’s Imperial Federation ideas,
boiled down : In the event of a European war in-
volving the Empire, he considers that Canada
should support the defence of the West Indies,
Bermuda, and Halifax; that India should support
the garrison at Aden ; and that Australia should
man Singapore and Hongkong.
Melb. Argus plays the heavy fool over
the provisions re aliens in Vic. Factory Act, and
balks of what the color-line has brought America
to. No one with less than a hundred eyes could
see any similarity between dragging niggers by
the wool into America and trying to keep China-
men out of Australia by a poll-tax.
About 30 per cent, of the plural-voters in
Melbourne are insolvent-holders of land-boom
properties. Most of them started their meteoric
careers as capitalists with nothing more than a
bank overdraft, and ended it by paying a fink in
the <£. And now they have one vote for manhood
and about six extra for their “ thrift.”
TheQ. Labor members should have opposed
all railways, guaranteed or not, until they knew
how the scheme was to be financed. They allowed
a free hand to individuals, and the result is modi-
fied chaos. Though Premier Nelson no doubt in-
tended mainly to bulldoze the electors, he had his
other eye on the possible split in the Labor corner.
Melb. Argus waxes generous :
The principle that one man should have one vote is nob
challenged by any political party in Victoria, either large
or small.
Then the paper goes on to argue that some men
should have two votes, which is a direct and open
challenge of “the principle that one man should
have one vote.”
Wanted—a list of the persons appointed
temporarily and permanently to N.S.W. Civil
Service by the Reid Govt. A full list and ex-
planatory notes thereon would be an edifying
document, judging from certain very circum-
stantial statements which have reached The Bul-
letin.
The believers in the ancient 13 supersti-
tion can add to their proofs and evidences the
famous wrangle which split the pioneer Labor-
party in N.S. Wales. It occurred over the
thirteenth plank of the original Labor platform;
and the figures in the division were 14 to 13. Of
the 13 in the minority, not one has ever gob back
to Parliament since.
“ Recess is the blessed time of Responsible
Government without Responsibility, when the
weary touch the button and the wicked do the
rest.” The Turner Govt, badly wants to get into
recess “ to prepare more Bills for Parliament.”
What Vic. wants is a Govt, that won’t prepare
more Bills, but will simply get on with those that
are waiting. The Land-tax is badly wanted, and
HAIR SOUP.
LONG-HAIRED PROFESSIONAL (dining at restaurant): “Waiter, there’s a
hair in this soup.”
WAITER (who has not been tipped): “Then why don’t you get your
hair cut?”
the State Bank, and the Companies Bill just tem-
porarily shelved, &e. Vic. wants more Acts, not
more Bills. Acts speak louder than Bills.
Vic. papers have a deal to say about the
“ gross blunder ” of P.M.G. Duffy in letting out
the margins of post-cards for beer and tobacco
advt. purposes. Yet Duffy’s blunder was no more
gross than that of every Vic. Government in
plastering beer and tobacco advts. on the railway-
stations. The teetotallers happened to whoop in
one case and not in the other ; that’s all the
difference.
N. Queensland has 18 representatives in
the Assembly, and only three Ministers. Oonse-
quently, the North is to get every railway it
wants with one little exception. The Central
District has nine M’sL.A., but hasn’t a single
Minister to its credit, and its share of public
plunder borders on the infinitesimal. No wonder
Separation is dead in the North and very much
alive in the Centre. Even the South is com-
mencing to growl against the Northern aggression.
Queensland is a much-“ judged ” country.
It has one O. J. at .£3500 a year, and ordinarily
four puisne Judges at <£2ooo each, besides
the District Court Judges. Yet some who
claim to speak for its 400,000 odd people
want another Judge appointed—in face of the
A FAIR OFFER.
MENSER MOTZERKLEISS (to Simcka Abramovich, who wants his daughter):
“ My daughter has £20,000; if you close your business on Satur-
days I'll make it £30,000.”
SIMOKA ABRAMOVICH (with an eye to business): “ Veil, make it
£50,000 and I'll close altogether.”
fact that Justice Real is always blurting forth
from the bench that the Supreme Court Judges
are not over-worked, and a few days ago sug-
gested that they should be allowed to fill in their
spare time with Petty Debts Court work.
The great Midland Railway arbitration,
with two expensive arbitrators, an umpire, and
about 10 of the highest-priced lawyers in the pro-
vince and a whole lot of solicitors engaged, is
now in progress in Maoriland. That whirring,
grinding noise you hear across the Tasman Sea is
the bill of costs beginning to mount up. The pro-
ceedings had hardly commenced before they were
interrupted by a disagreement between “ Sirs ”
Charles Lilley and Bruce Burnside, the arbitra-
tors, on a question of jurisdiction; and Blake,
M.P., the umpire, is now hearing the case by
himself.
Brother Frank Madden in Vic. Assembly:
A few years ago the foremost plank in the Liberal plat-
form was a compulsory eight hours day and a minimum
rate of wage; but these had been abandoned in favor of
the principle of one-man-one-vote, because if that was
carried the other things would follow as a necessary
corollary.
Exactly. “ Out of the mouths of babes and suck-
lings.” Even the Madden family gets hold of a
fact occasionally.
Four of Q. Labor-party refused to join in
a farewell address to Gov. Norman, said address
stating, “We, your Majesty’s faithful and dutiful
servants,” or twaddle to that effect. The style
of the address was all they objected to. In fact,
they had the courage of their opinions as Republi-
cans, and this is where all the loyal howl comes
in. What would even “loyalists” think of
Jefferson and Franklin had they thus kowtowed
to the amiable and accomplished George 111. ?
A bill has been engineered through Vie.
Assembly to abolish plural voting and establish
woman-suffrage in Assembly elections. If this
passes the Council it should gradually get the
Lower House into fine condition for kicking at
the Council’s property franchise. The Victorian
Council is the closest and most utterly hopeless
corporation in Australia, and when the People’s
Chamber resolves to reform it the battle should be
the biggest thing in Australian history. A House
which is elected by landlords, and in which only
large landlords are eligible to sit, can hardly be
reformed except with a meat-axe taken externally.
A lot of the Sydney unemployed have been
sent up by the Reid Government to do road-
making work at Wyalong. The local unemployed
would probably have done it a lot better, being
mainly bushmen and miners, while a large pro-
portion of the city-men are destitute clerks, shop-
men, and mechanics ; also, in the case of the local
men, there would have been no railway-fares to
pay. But the object of relief-work is to diminish
the gatherings at the “ statter ” and in the
Domain, and to get rid of the people who bowl in
the Government’s ear with deputations and peti-
tions and processions. Those who are out of
howlshot don’t matter.
Several Tas. papers the other day received
a special note from Premier Braddon, announcing
that a number of copies of an English trade-
publication had been received from the Agent-
General, and one was therewith forwarded. This
shows what advantages proprietors of trade-
circulars may reap from the careful cultivation
of Australian Agents-General. Free postage, free
distribution, free clerical-work, free everything
for a private business-concern ! And the soft-
headed Australian taxpayer cheerfully pays for
the lot.
At Premier
Kingston’s invita-
tion an interpro-
vincial conference
on the colored-
labor question is
to be held in Syd-
ney during J an.
Gov. Brassey,
at a recent Mel-
bourne mayoral
banquet; “If you
were to make a
declaration of in-
dependence to-
morrow, you could
not be more free
or more self-
governing than
you now are.” If
the British liti-
gant, who has won
his case at great
trouble and ex-
pense in his own
courts, could be
dragged, on an ap-
peal. before a
privy council in
Austria, or Chili,
or some other
place equally re-
mote, and have to
wait, perhaps, a
year or two, or
three, for a final
decision, he would
naturally feel free
and independent,
wouldn’t he? One
could understand
a poor Governor,
who was wholly
dependent on his
salary, telling
yarns like this to
please his bosses
and make himself
solid for another
engagement. But
Brassey, with all
his millions, can
surely afford to
tell the solid facts
of the ease occa-
sionally.
Wynne, M.L.0., has a Bill before Vic.
Leg. Council providing that when a man dies
intestate and leaves a widow, but no children, the
widow shall inherit all his estate up to <£looo.
On anything above JllOOO the bereaved woman, as
at present, is to get one-half, while the other half
goes to the old man’s relations. The Bulletin for
one would gladly see a law passed whereby the
widow, i n intestate cases where there are no children,
would take everything. A wife is her husband’s
partner, and often does quite as much as he
towards the accumulation of the family pile. In
most cases, too, she would get it, only the aver-
age man is in a state of beastly ignorance about
the law, and seldom troubles to find out that, if
he dies intestate and childless, his widow gets
only half the pittance he leaves behind him, and
the balance is divided among his seventy-seventh
cousins all over the earth, and the expense of
hunting up these far-off relatives comes out of the
estate, so that the relict has to pay for finding
them. Sargood (usually a Fat Man of the most
aggressive type) went one better than Wynne
with a proposal that the widow’s mite should be
raised from .£lOOO to <£sooo.

Governor Brassey owns one-fifth of Lon-
don Daily News.
The Earl of Yarmouth has settled in
Rockhampton, Q., where he is managing (among
other sweet things) a sugar-plantation.
Three new barristers were called to the
Vic. Bar last week—Braham, Wassell, and Ni
Gan —a Jew, a German, and a Chinaman.-
Subscriptions have been opened in Mel-
bourne for raising a monument to the late J. B.
Patterson. The people are asked to return what
he gave them—a stone.
It is on the cards that the Yic. Austra-
lian Natives’ Association will shortly invite
Chamberlain to visit Australia. The cards say
nothing about him accepting.
Although Mr. Justice Hood is now re-
garded as about the best Vic. Judge, he often
says that for the first seven years of practice he
did not make enough to live on.
“R. K. Dee,” author of “Mortgaged
Years,” is O’Hara Wood, a Melb. barrister.
Under his nom de plume, “ R.K.D.” (Arcady), he
wrote a “ Dream of Fair Judges.”
While in Adelaide Lord Hampden's com-
posure was much ruffled because he could not find
his “ commission.” It evidently turned up before
he got to Sydney, as he was sworn-in all right.
Canon Potter, Melbourne’s gallows-advo-
cate —the “ Scriptural Potter’s field ” was a “ field
of blood ” —has lost his black cat, and advertises for
it. May his reverence soon lose his gallows also !
Justice Real (Q.) is physically the biggest
man on the Australasian bench. He is over
average height and massive in proportion. He
towers head and shoulders over all his colleagues.
Thirteen barristers and solicitors appeared
in N.S.W. Central Criminal Court on Monday
for Crown and accused in the Dean alleged-
conspiracy case. Thirteen ! The curse of Dean
again!
Manager Cook, of S.M. Herald, invariably
asks literary employment-seekers whether they
possess University degrees—presumably because
the average B.A. •ni.kes such a dismally poor
reporter.
Let Gov. Norman ’ware the outward
voyage. Blackali died in harness, as did Maurice
O’Connell. Joshua Peter Bell died at the helm,
as did Anthony Musgrave ; Arthur Kennedy died
on the trip Out.
Lowenthal, sentenced to death for shoot-
ing bis wife, who had in her arms a baby through
whose body the bullet passed, is now a consump-
tive patient in Adelaide hospital. He says he
wishes he had been hanged.
Gov. Brassey has
had but one pull on
the unclean Yarra.
The first thing he
met on his voyage
was an extremely de-
cayed suicide. Since
then he propels his
imported boat
through the weedy
waters of Albert
Park lagoon.
Byron Miller,
the eminent Tas. ad-
vocate, when a youth,
heard at his father’s
dinner-table a
learned discussion
anent the confes-
sional privileges and
duties of criminal
counsel —the discus-
sion arose out of a
case lately referred
to by ex-Chief-Jus-
tice Lilley—and By-
ron, the embryonic
pleader, solemnly
registered a vow that
throughout his pros-
pective legal career
he would never will-
ingly know whether
a client was guilty or
innocent. He has
kept his resolution.
His opinion, apropos
of the Salomons-
Meagher-Dean trou-
ble, is that a lawyer
should never, under
any circumstances,
confess, although in
the event of an inno-
cent man being con-
signed to the scaffold,
the lawyer, knowing
from confessions
made to him that in-
nocence was being
slaughtered, might
with propriety assure
the Bench and autho-
rities on his profes-
sional honor that
such was the fact.
The lawyer and the
priest, beholds, stand
on the same plane
exactly, either hav-

The health of Dr. “Billy” Maloney,
M.L.A. for West Melbourne, is so shaken that he
has been given leave of absence from Parliamen-
tary duties for the rest of the session. He intends
taking a trip to Colombo and back. It is “ the
little doctor’s ” misfortune to be too much in
earnest—when he says his heart bleeds for the
down-trodden something or other he means it.
Justice Cooper, promoted to Q. Supreme
Court Bench vice Harding, stopped short one day
in the hearing of cases when a District Court
Judge in the North, and refused to go on again
till the Treasury wired him up some disputed
arrears of salary. A District Court Judge bold
enough to make a record like that, will, when
Supreme Court Judge, be capable on fit oppor-
tunity of snapping a thumb at the Governor and
both Houses of Parliament.
Jennings, the half-caste
“ king ” of Swain’s Island, near
Samoa, has demonstrated the
utility of the honey-bee in the
fructification of the cocoa-nut.
He imported a hive, and soon
found that the trees nearest to
its location largely increased
their crop of nuts. He says that
on many of the islands the trees
have become perfectly barren,
no doubt owing to the absence
of insects capable of transferring
the pollen. Swain’s Island, by
the way, is one of the show-
places of the South Seas. It was
taken up in 1856 by a Yankee
named Jennings, who married a
Samoan wife, and proceeded to
make things hum. His son has
continued his policy. The
homestead, church (with a clock-
tower and clockl, and the resi-
dences of the other colonists, are
quite up to date, and “king”
Jennings has a collection of tools
which enables him to ply the
callings of a watchmaker, ship-
wright, coaohbuilder, joiner,
and blacksmith. The island is
but 800 a. in extent, and is sur-
rounded by a good road. His
highness Jennings journeys
daily around his dominions in
an American buggy. A ’Frisco
firm lately offered <£40,000 for
the island, which was refused.
Jennings flies a flag of his own,
based on the stars-and-stripes
idea.
Brunton Stephens is the
Queensland poet-laureate. His
verses, “Norman is safe,” on
the Governor’s departure, are
well up to the lofty laureate level
attained by Nahum Tate, Lewis
Morris and other bards who have
beslobbered royalty from raeit
immemorial. The amount of
grovel expended over the depar-
ture of the simple, good-natured old Governor is
enough to make a Bananalander forswear his
countr
LANGUAGE OF THE BACKBLOGKS.
(Mrs. Highflyer's female servants had cleared out, and Billy, the rouse-
about, who had come with the family from the station, answered the door).
MRS. TYSON-CHIENSIDE : “ Is Mrs. Highflyer in?”
BILLY : “ No, she isn’t.”
MRS. T.-C.: “ Can you tell me which is her day at home?”
BILLY : “Well, no mum; I can’t say what day she'll be at home. All I
know is she goes out a devil of a lot.”
District Court Judge Paul (Q.), who is
now likely to be raised to the Supreme Court
bench, was denied promotion on two previous
occasions on the ground of ill-health. He has
outlived at least three Judges whose apparently
robuster health won them the preference. His
appointment will be popular with both “the pro-
fession ” and the public.
Perhaps the smallest Judge on any Bench
is Mr. Justice Adams, of Tasmania. Seen from
the body of the Court there is nothing extra-
ordinary about his head and shoulders ; but when
he rises ! In the chair his feet are not
within a foot of the floor, and, belltopper included,
he does not reach an ordinary man’s armpit when
upright. Most people always feel inclined to pat
his Honor on the head and ask him where he
lives.

W. HARKINS (16 years of age), winner of Sydney
Wheel-race.
The first Governor of S.A. (Capt. Hind-
marsh) fought under Nelson at the Nile and Tra-
falgar. The second (Col. Gawler) fought under
Wellington at Badajoz (where Hori Grey’s father
was killed) and at Waterloo.
Melb. Age, the other day, inadvertently
alluded in a leader to “Mr.” John MTntyre, and
hastened next issue to regret its omission of the
politician’s title. There was no genius in the
office to suggest that the slip should be established
as a precedent.
Adelaide is being flooded with two brands
of beer named after Gov. Buxton. Which must
be rather galling to the new Gov., who wishes it
to be particularly understood that he is not an
active brewer, although he has—ah—investments
in brewery shares.
The Salvation Army, like the ballet, puts
its. best leg foremost. The “General,” or his
myrmidons, ransacked Australia for the two hand-
somest lady captains, to be the standard-bearers
put on white horses, ct la Joan of Arc, at the
head of his Melb. procession.
A mild sensation has been caused in
Sydney by the reception into the R.C. church
of the well-known Mr. Laidley Mort —an erst-
while Anglican gentleman so widely and justly
esteemed that his ’version can surely make no
serious alteration in his chances of Paradise.
A valueless generalisation : Max O’Rell, in
“John Bull and C 0.,” designating Australia
“Greater Scotland,” says “Out of seven Gover-
nors, five are Scottish.” Look around now and
count the Scotsmen. Mao’s little fact was valu-
able only as a little fact, not as the basis of a
national deduction.
Mandarin Quong Tart handled the pistol
in great style at Sydney bicycle-sports. Awhile
back Quong was starting some races when his old
horse-pistol kept missing fire. Met next day and
asked what the difficulty was he replied, “Oh, I
don’t know, unless the dam Chinese cartridges
were filled with sand.”
A knowledge of history is useful at times.
On the tombstone of old Geo. Bates, the first
resident of S.A., who died recently, aged 95, it
was written : “ He was in the British navy, under
Nelson, in 1813.” It was almost cruel to tell the
monumental-mason who gave the stone that the
hero of Trafalgar was killed in 1805.
The ennobbled and bebaubled G. Repub-
lican Dibbs was a sight for the gods at the late
Sydney R.C. conversazione—Windsor uniform,
cocked hat, and all. Dibbs’s troubles that the
“ribbon” and “star” only are en rbgle at social
functions ! Dibbs’s worry that the cocked hat,
sword, and braided uniform are supposed to be
reserved for State ceremonials! Dibbs—he was
the State “ but yesterday ! ”
Herewith The Bulletin prints a portrait
of Sheridan, the abortionist, condemned to death
at Sydney in connection with the death at his
hands of the unhappy girl, Jessie Nichols. Though
Sheridan may be technically gui-lty of murder,
there are many, even among the advocates of
capital punishment, who would deeply regret to
see his crime placed by the authorities on the same
plane as assassination cold-bloodedly committed
without extenuating circumstances.
Gov. Brassey made a great fuss of “Gen.”
Booth—had him to lunch at Guvmentouse, gave
him a handsome cheque, and attended two or
three of his meetings. At the meetings, an
“officer” was specially set aside to watch the
Governor, lest any of the conversion brigade
should go up to him, as he sat in front, and ask
him, “ Are you saved, dear brother ? ” “ You are
not to speak to the bald gentleman with the red
face,” was the “ Commissioner’s ” order.
As fat as Premier Reid. — New proverb.
Spagnoletti : “ Dreamt last night ol
General Booth’s hallelujah wedding -at Melb.
Exhibition. Furore. Celebrants, Goe and Fit-
chett. Best men, Brassey and Madden. Pit,
one guinea ; gallery, a crown. She didn’t look a
day older than Mrs. Parkes.”
Gov. Brassey struck a new brand of diluted
grovel the other day at a suburban railway-station,
where the Rip Van Winkle in charge welcomed
him to Victoria “on behalf of himself and the
staff.” The staff was at that precise moment
engaged in polishing a lamp-glass with an oil-rag.
Gov. Brassey drives through Melb. streets
with “ Baby Brassey ” on his knee, and all the
fond mothers say what a dear, fatherly Governor
he is. Hopetoun never appeared anywhere with
his youngster. The Brassey Governorship, how-
ever, is a family affair. The suite is largely home-
made.
Prince Luigi takes back from Australia tq
King Humbert a pocket-book of recommenda-
tions for the title of Cavaliere della Corona dTtalia,
certain Australians being anxious that United
Italy shall be represented by “cavaliere ” to coun-
teract the influence of the Jenningses, Slatterys,
Hugheses, and other Papal Knights of St.
Gregory.
Lady Victoria Buxton and her two daugh-
ters put in a couple of hours listening to the
debate in S.A. Assembly on the Village Settle-
ments Bill. The Speaker and a good many mem-
members felt very awkward when, during their
stay, Price, M.P., said : “ And now I will strip
off the frills and embellishments, and come to the
guts of the argument.” It was generally con-
sidered that “entrails” would really have done just
as well.
J. B. O’Hara thus dedicates the second
series of his “ Songs of the South ” :
TO SIR JOHN MADDEN, K.0.M.G., LL.D.,
Chief Justice of Victoria,
As a very slight but sincere token of admiration for
his exalted character, respect for his profound learn-
ing, and gratitude for his friendship, this volume is
respectfully dedicated.
In the middle of the same volume are verses “In
Memory of George Higinbotham.” What a
mockery !
The idea of dying together was one long
entertained by the Dacres. More than ten years
ago (writes a Bulletin correspondent), when
returning from their American tour in the City of
Richmond, the cargo—mostly cotton —caught fire.
On the passengers being first alarmed, Dacre and
his wife kissed one another, and said they would
wait till the last moment and go down clasped
together. Oddly enough, on this occasion Daore’s
presence of mind did much to allay the panie
among the passengers.

SHERIDAN, condemned to death in the
Jessie Nichols case.
The Bulletin has just dropped across a
paragraph in its own issue of May 3, 1890, which
says that “ the present London rage is the nightly
recitation by Amy Roselle (Mrs. Arthur Dacre)
of Savile Clarke’s verses, ‘ The Siege of Luck-
now.’ ” Then the par. proceeds to quote a stanza,
showing how, when the defenders had given up
hope, a man and his wife who had fought together
through the long conflict determined on their plan
of action :
Then the last day, came as we thought, and death seemed
fairer still
Than the fate which might one day be ours if the foeman
had his will.
And 1 turned to the man who loved me, and I said—“ By
our plighted troth,
By the love that we bear each other, now swear me a
resolute oath,
When the last onset comes you will keep me one cart-
ridge -you understand—
And save me, and kill me. Oh, love ! 'Twill be best that
I die by your hand.”
Then he bent down and kissed me and promised ; while
the words that he spoke will remain
Engraven for aye on my heart, until death re-unites us
again.
Fate ! Premonition ! What was it ?

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS.
WE beg to inform our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American Tobacco Co.,
Ltd., of N.S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under the brands of “Allen and
Ginter’s Straight-cut No. 1,” “Cameo” and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “ Pure Gold ” and “Dixon’s No. I,’’have given us official notice that they will not
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the agency held by
us for New South Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W. D. and H. O. WILLS, Limited,
the manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes known as
“THREE CASTLES” and “ CAPSTAN.”
We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the nterest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co., Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
Wills’ “Three Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
“Three Castles” and “ Capstan” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke.

the latter explained ; “You see, Mr. Trotter,
it’s like this. Adipose dummied inside our boun-
dary to increase his holding, and we did the same
on him. By and by, with additional C. P’s,
volunteer land orders, conditional leases and
mineral leases, each found the other fellow on an
inland in the centre of the most valuable part of
the run. So we swapped, and I’m here and Pan-
nikin lives over there.”
A new word—the Shylockracy.
Prof. McCoy, like most experimental
scientists and close continuous observers, thinks
snake-suicide impossible. Over and over again
he has kept a lot of well-fed, healthy tiger-snakes
in the same box, and stirred them to anger with a
stick; yet, though they bit each other most
viciously, no harm was done them by each other s
venom. Once he put a live mouse into a tiger-
snake’s box as food for it. Next morning he found
lie snake dead, the mouse having bitten it across
back of the neck and eaten some of its flesh.

Dear Bulletin, — The philosopher whom
you quote as denying the existence in Nature of
anything “ square or really straight,” is about as
accurate as was to be expected of the distinguished
geometrician who talks about the “ section ” of a
circle. The constituent “crystals” of nearly all
inorganic bodies have rectilinear and, conse-
quently, angular faces. If this dogmatic person
will put a pinch of sugar under a magnifying-glass,
he will find that he has got an aggregation of that
particular solid—having six square faces—which
may possibly be more familiar to him in connec-
tion with “ Yankee-grab.” And so everywhere —
the rectilinear figure in all its varieties, with no-
where the semblance of what, by a “conceit due
to the limitations of the human mind,” is called a
curve because the shortness of the successive right
lines composing it is inconceivable. Nature is
straight lines !— Rhombus.
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page
23 of this issue.
A person signing himself “Loyalist”
writes to Sydney Telegraph regretting that only
10 out of 150 Sydney barristerial sharks turned
up at Gov. Hampden’s first levee. This, he says,
however, “was not the result of discourtesy or
disloyalty on the part of the individual members
of the Bar, but was owing to the neglect of the
usual arrangements by which the representatives
of the Bar meet at the chambers of the Attorney-
General, and are presented by him to the Gover-
nor on their arrival at Government House. The
invitations usually issued by the Attorm y-
General were not sent out, and hence the absent e
of nearly all the members of the profession.”
In other words, the barristers used to meet at the
Attorney-General’s office, and ride to Govmen-
touse in carriages provided at the cost of the tax-
payers, and when (owing to the matter having
been ventilated by some rascally M.P. it became
necessary for the barristers to hire their own
vehicles as other people had to do), these be-
wigged loyalists almost unanimously stayed
away. That is what is meant by “ neglect of
the usual arrangements. ” Even the richest sharks,
in most cases, wouldn’t sacrifice a cab-fare for the
sake of their “ loyalty.”

The Weßtralian mining market, which has had
a bit of a “ set back ” lately in sympathy with Kaffirs, is
nowr forginsr ahead again, writes Tub Bulletin’s London
correspondent by last mail. But when is some gold
coming forward ? Companies without number have been
floated, with the assistance of Exploration and Finance
00. s, but this cannot go on in the absence of returns. It
may be safely asserted that not five per cent, of the co’s
recently launched will ever pay a shilling in divs. The
Lady Loch, which was over-capitalised, and started with-
out sufficient working capital, has just advertised a sub-
sidiary co. yclept the Forest King, which will hardly be a
success so far as the public is concerned. It is surely
early days yet to commence “watering” the stock of a
mine which seems to have fair prospects but is still an
unknown factor.

G. M Leod Matheson — killed at Coolgardie by
falling off a balcony—when M.P. for Glen Innes, N.S.W.,
floated the White Rock (a practically valueless silver-
mine) for a million, and thought it was worth ten. He
made a fortune in broker’s commissions during the big
silver-boom, but he afterwards went to London on several
big schemes which failed, returned to N.S.W. desperately
hard up, and went digging for gold, and finding none, in
the Shoalhaven region. A year or so ago, he managed to
get out to Coolgardie, the great haven for accomplished
boomers, and, at his death, had reached the chairman-
ship of Kalgoorlie Stock Exchange. Had he and the
boom lived another two years he would probably have
reached for and made a million. As it is, he is said to
nave left a big fortune in cash, and a lot of valuable
interests.
• • * *
At Premier Forrest’s banquet at Hannan’s last
week, he concurred in the suggestion that the time was
not far distant when that field would be connected by
railway with Adelaide. Anywhere but Esperanee Bay,
the great natural route! If these fields live, and there
cannot be much doubt, about that, however disastrous the
coming slump, that railway will be built despite the Pre-
rn'^r,8e u' >Wed °PP° sitio "- A saving of 1000 miles by sea
and 200 by land cannot, be ignored for the sake of the six
—or sixty—families at Perth.
• • • •
From the spot, and from a man who knows his
way about :-Dear “ Wild Cat,”—Re Coolgardie. I believe
both Brown Hills and Boulders are good buying on their
merits ; they are about the only two at Hannan’s really
good just now. Kalgoorlies may come ere long ; a lot
will depend on management. Hannan’s Reward I have
never been able to get to the bottom of. The Boulder
crowd can get sufficient water at the lake. It is only a
matter of collecting it.—G.S.”
♦ * • *
One Shierlaw has returned to Coolgardie from
London, and says people there “only want to be assured
of the genuineness of the properties before taking them, as
there is unlimited money waiting investment.” These
assurances will be forthcoming—they always have been.

The Bulletin is warm, I think unduly so,
on the Murchison goldfield,” writes a correspondent.
This paper will always be warm on any field which has
quite a number of batteries not shut down for want of
water, and yet does not publish detailed weekly or fort-
nightly gold-returns and tonnage of crushings. This is
done on Bendigo, no matter how rich or poor the mines
may he ; on Ballarat, Charters Towers. Gympie, and all
other well-known Australian goldfields, and why is it
omitted on the Murchison? Are they afraid of the
average the returns would show ?
* ♦ ♦ ♦
Gruesome fact—Bayley’s battery closed down,
because of the price of water. Plenty of gold, of course,
but dear water.

The next important Plunderderry development
Wfli be an action for, say, £250,000 hy the prospectors
against Col. North and others. They claim that the
shares representing their sixth interest had to he lodged
at all hazards in the Union Bank, Melbourne, on a certain
date, and that they are not there yet. They naturally
want to participate in the profits oil the shares sold in
Pans—largely on the strength of their specimens.

Bar and Tindalls, what do the holders of the gordelpus
claims close to Coolgardie think of their chance ?—and
the trouble is, they are numerous. Gordelpus I

the only reason. J

dalls and Golden Bar, claims “close up,” Coolgardie have

showed fair stone. It seems pretty safe to assert that no
claims on the Coolgardie side of Hannan’s will crush an
ounce to the ton. Worse luck—for Coolgardie

Premier Forrest is agreeable to increased repre-
sentation for the W.A. goldfields, “ but not on the basis
of population. Why? Representation in W.A. or any-
where else except on the basis of copulation is a farce
• • * »
Toe latest Westralian dodge is to wire an
obscure country paper from some new “find,” stating
Blank and Dash, erstwhile local residents, have struck it
rich, and announcing that they are coming home to float
the good thing amongst their friends. The paper glad
to get fllhng-up stuff, puts it in double leaded-and the
rest is comparatively easy.
• * » •
Mailed to The Bulletin by a very “big”
London man, lately in Australia; “Market still fairly
good but a little heavy, and I fear there will he a slump
before long. I get bad accounts of the water situation at
Hannan s, and am afraid it will have a serious effect on
the stock. People here do not stop to think about this
water question—they seem to think it will come out all
right, but can give no reason why or wherefore • there-
fore, you may expect the collapse soon, unless they get a
big rainfall at Coolgardie." Prophetic.
• • * •
Premier Forrest says the W.A. Govt, has
formulated a scheme to bring water from the ocean to
Coolgardie at a cost of six millions, but before starting on
so mighty an effort it proposes to see if sufficient water
cannot be got by boring. Remote hope, for, up to date
whatever water is found in W.A. by boring is densely
salt and quickly exhausted. The hope of finding artesian
water on the Ooolgardie fields is almost abandoned. The
ocean seems the only available adequate supply—and what
will become of the field meanwhile ?
* • • *
Great Boulder for the two weeks ended Nov. 2G •
290 tons, 12120 z. smelted gold.
It has been found that although nominally all
the ground was leased and surveyed within miles of the
ureat Roulder, there was a 15-acre block almost adjoin-
ing the Boulder that had never been pegged or leased.
It was immediately snapped up by the Golden Link
manager on behalf of his English co.
A good find is reported from the Boulder South
Extended. It is averred that the stone is as rich as any
thing ever struck in the Great Boulder, and, as the find
was made near the southern boundary of this line it adds
very considerably to the value of the Boulder, which has
several hundred feet of ground unworked on the
southern boundary. It is intended to sink a shaft near
the new find in the Boulder ground, and to connect it
with the main working’s.
* ♦ • •
The latest plan of the leases taken up around
and for miles ahead and behind the Great Boulder is an
appalling sight. What will become of nine-tenths of
them now that J. Bull has closed his purse can be easily
guessed. The Govt, has the application money and wiil
soon have the ground again for the next boom.
* • * »
“Boulder” Brookman hinted at a recent Lon-
don banquet that “£5O was not an unlikely price for
Great Boulder shares to reach before long.'” Shares
shortly after saw £5, but that nought was missing. The
Boulder is a claim about which nothing is yet absolutely'
certain. The most contradictory accounts reach the East
concerning it.

Berry royalties are on the slump. In previous

new agreement quashes the royalty and substitutes £2OO

Dear Bulletin,—When I wrote that a badly-
managed State Bank would be the w'orst thing that could
happen to Victoria, I meant to suggest that it might pos-
sibly create an aristocracy of financial scoundrels at the
public expense True, the private hanks did a good deal
in that way, but the boom-bubble didn't last as long as a
State Bank swindle could. The possibilities of evil in the
S.B. scheme are appalling.—B. Liste.
In the Investors’ Review, A. J. Wilson
(privately as mild a mannered man as ever cut a throat)
once said that the Q. National Hank and another
were the greatest sinners of all the Australian
banks. The Q.N.B. issued a writ, and A.J. had eight
days to answer according to law. Before he could rush
his lawyer’s address in the bank had closed for alteration
and repairs. A.J. just laughed in a modulated diapason.

No doubt exists that he was also “ had,” for he is re-
putedly as “straight as they make ’em.” Parkes,
though, always had great faith in the Angipena district.

SPOUTING NOTIONS.
Harry Musgrove is so pre-eminently the man
to conduct an Australian Eleven on tour that his rumored
readiness to undertake the job sounds rather too good to
he true. As a showman, an accountant, and a peace-
maker, lire Firm s business-manager stands alone, like
Katisha s front tooth. For years past he has been en-
gaged in pouring oil on the troubled waters of professional
jealousy, whilst concentrating his other eye on the gate-
money. Harry Musgrove’s qualifications for the new
billet lie several deep. They are piled up for public
criticism. He has travelled around with many Gaiety
companies, Royal opera - companies, and pantomime-
armies in tile triplicate character of guide, philosopher,
and friend, with his familiar Spirit of Good Fellowship
always at his elbow. He is an Australian in all respects
hut, birth, and very nearly a native at that. The difficult
Giff-'ii is said to “cotton” to him, and all other good
cricketers know him and like him well. Moreover, Harry
Musgrove is himself a cricketer—a real artist at the game
‘ 80 3 team that went ’Ome with him would have an extra
emergency-man to fall hack upon. If it be a fact that he
is open to accept the hillet of manager to the next Aus-
tralian Eleven, the public would like to consider the
matter settled as soon as possible.
Musgrove’s cricketing reputation got into the
background when he became a theatrical identity, but he
was a young hero with the bat less than a dozen j'ears
ago, and has kept himself in fair practice. His first
appearance against an English Eleven was a record for a
debutant. It happened at Ballarat, and Harry “topped
the centui'3’ (109). The same year he was chosen to
play for Australia v. England at Melbourne, and for Vic-
toria in interprovincial matches with N.S.W. and S.A.
Next year it became with him a question of cricket or
business, and he decided to play for Williamson, Garner,
and brother George. Harry Musgrove was, and still is, a
pretty batsman —a quick wrist-player, who can knock the
hall over the boundary without turning a hair. He has
an easy way of doing all things.
* * * *
The selection of Queensland cricketers to prac-
tise “for interprovincial ” has caused great disgust
among all clubs not in the sacred ranks of Graziers or
Oakfields. The committee were M'Donnell (Graziers),
Macdonald (Oakfields), and Boyle, a stranger in Brisbane,
To exclude men like Crouch and Murray is considered to
be scandalous.
• • • »
The paucity of good bowlers in S.A. has
prompted the offering of five guineas by the association
for a junior competition. Each will be allowed 50 balls :
three leading batsmen participate in the fun, and points
decide the cash.
Of the 20 men qualified to chip into the Austral
final no less than 17 will run for Victoria—if they all
come up to the scratch. Tasmania, N.S.W., and Maori-
land have each one representative going for them. A. B.
Crisp, W, J, C, Elliott, and long Either are the
“foreigners,” and it is on the cards that they may get
two of the three places among them. Also, it is quite
likely that the whole ±1250 sweeepstake will stop in
Victoria.
Young Bungey, of S.A., would probably have
been among the first 20 but for his had luck in hap-
pening to come to grief. His fall in the first heat may
have robbed the final of some interprovincial interest
without affecting the result. Bungey was not quite good
enough to take the two-mile race.
Parsons and Pither, on the 80 yards mark, D.
J. Walker (120) and M. J. M'Lean (170) are top-weight for
the Austral. The others rejoice in starts ranging from
210 to 310 yards. Saturday’s running doesn’t give Par-
sons a great chance, nor M'Lean, who seemed to be fairly
collared by the Vic. champion in their heat. Pither
being just now in good fettle, ought to hold the other
three top-weights safe, and yet his chance of annexing
the £2OO first prize is not very rosy.
The writer fancies that the tail-end of Saturday’s
struggle will he provided by the following seven • O N
Hall (210), E J. Jones (210), and W. ,1. C. Elliott (220)’
Guarevitch (230), A. B. Crisp (255), A. W. Hill (275), J. R.’
Anderson (310). Herewith a wild attempt to place them •
1. A. W. HILL.
2. W. J. C. ELLIOTT.
2. C. N. HALL.
It is a lamentable fact that bikists, as a rule, are addicted
to superfluous Christian names.
Elliott captured third money last year, notwith-
standing that he rode with bad judgment. C. N. Hall
has gone nearer still to victory, for in 1890 he finished
only half-a-foot behind the winning “ scratch ” man, Tom
Busst. Several things can be said in favor of Hill’s
chance. He won his heat brilliantly ; it was the fastest
heat of the series: and he dismounted from his
bike in an unbiked—no, unbaked state. None of
the weary stragglers looked less unwell than
H’ill. There was no suggestion of a death-mark
on his brow% whereas the average young wheelist after
taking a deep draught of what Dr. Springthorpe’ calls
“the champagne of athletics ” looks ready to expire.
Besides, Hill wasn’t accounted dangerous on his previous
performances. He who does something very unexpected
in very good style is likely to do something better next
time. With only one man starting in front of him Hill
ought to have a nice run for his money.
Dr. Springthorpe, by the way, was a prominent
figure in the centre of the ground for awhile. When a
number of distressed hikisis had cast suspicion upon the
healthfulness of their sport by lying fl it upon their faces
with pains in their insides, the Doctor’s beaming coun-
tenance disappeared.
Payne and Megson bore indirect testimony to
the Austral “form” of Hill and Hall, who finished first
and second in the fourth heat. Although neither of the
N.S. W, cracks could make a hold show against the long-
start men in this heat, they subsequently ran first and
third for the Victoria Mile.
No objection was raised re Martin’s flying start
in the Fl> ing Stakes final. His attendant shoved him off
before the pistol gave the word. The burly Yank cer-
tainly swerved, as though doubtful about proceeding,
and thus lost some of his advantage, but, all the same, he
was on the job sooner than any of the others.
The Melb. crowd hailed Martin as “ Fatty ! ”
when he first appeared, and his heavy, toilsome style o(
pushing his machine along didn’t impress them at all.
When the fat man’s reserve force began to assert itself
public opinion on the question of how a bikist ought to
be built was revolutionised. Martin appeared to sprint
the heart out of Parsons in the Mile International Scratch
Race. He beat the Viclorian for their first heat, and, 40
minutes later, out generalled him for the final, having
picked up the Flying Stakes in the meantime; Then the
fickle crowd said : “ Well, look at the size of him 1 ’’ in
quite an altered tone.
The Yanks never miss a chance of theatrical
effect in the sports arena. After their first set-to for the
Scratch Mile, victorious Martin bowled up alongside Par-
sons and made him shake bands.
Parsons’ desperate finish, with Martin in front
of him and the grim Harris at his heels, was rather a
shocking sight. The Victorian nearly fell off his bike as
he passed the post. However, he hung on to the handles,
and managed to turn himself off the track, then, having
81 feeb 'y. or assistance, he was lifted out of the
saddle and carried to the pavilion, doubled up uncom-
fortably in somebody’s arms. Parsons hurt his foot
Kirk’s pedal during the race, but that did not
affect the result. The day was sultry and the stronger
man won.
Martin, the Yank, and Porta, the stout son of
Italy, could lick any three of the Australian wheelmen at
digging a trench, one supposes. As exponents of biking
they are most unlovely, though.

The prophecy that neither C. Turner (first
favorite) nor Matthews (second favorite) would win the
Austral was promptly fulfilled, as both men were snuffed
out in their heats. Turner didn’t have a fair chance, for
the tjre of his racer blew out upon the starting-post, and
he had to ride a machine which didn’t suit him.
♦ ♦ ♦ *
Several superstitious people have backed Elliott
for the Austral because his machine came by the Austral
steamer; and if Elliott’s luck sticks to him he couldn’t
help winning. He got second in his heat minus six
spokes ripped out of his frail wheel by Matthews’ pedal.
Elliott s machine weighs only 191 b., and its living after
the collision is a stroke of destiny.
* * * »
The hero of Saturday was undoubtedly Martin,
who, like Megson, the divinity of last year, carded off the
mile championship and another event. He was scarcely
ever off the track, and performed the marvellous feat of
competing in every race on the programme, winning the
finals of the Mile Championship and the Flying Stakes
without an interval and riding at another period two
heats running. Martin’s previous races in Melb. have all
taken place at night, and the really wonderful part of his
performances became apparent for the first time on
Saturday, when it was seen that the man knows abso-
lutely nothing about “ scientific ” bicycle riding
It is “ Scotch navigation,” sheer strength and pluck'
that wins Martin his races. He pedals flat-footed, wob-
bles Ins handle-bar, and shakes Sheol out of his machine
—but he wins all right.
Kirk is a man to keep an eye upon. Fit and
well, there are not three Australian cyclists whom he is
not able to bustle over the mile.
The Englishman, Harris, is a beauty on a
machine, a prettier pedaller than any man who has yet
appeared on the M.C.G., and he has the strength to back
i t up. Harris will make a few sit up before he leaves
Australia. He is a splendidly-built young fellow with a
round, close-cropped bullet head, balanced by the square
cheery countenance which usually characterises the pro-
fessional pug as he gets home on his opponent’s point.
In fact, Harris s ensemble would cause anybody to put
him down as a man of fists rather than ankles. He is a
very decent, unassuming youth, and his mode of expres-
sion is more like the “spoken” part of one of Harry
Rickards s coster songs than any conversation yet heard
in Australia. J

The banked cinder cycling-track at Sydney
Agricultural Ground promises to he a record-smasher
and, as Mr. Webster was first in the field, it is to be hoped
his ground will be allowed to make a few pounds out of
the venture before the grab-all Sydney Cricket Ground
crowd step in. The latter are already talking of forming
a banked track. Such a track, by the way, would go far
to spoil the ground as a cricket-field
* * ♦ *
Now that it is all over, writes a Bulletin cor-
respondent, would any other crowd under the sun have
taken the Zimmerman fiasco at Sydney so quietly?
hanoy Fitzsimmons and Corbett drawing 30,000 people
together, fighting half a round, and then one of them
withdrawing and announcing that he was too unwell to
fight, but he didn’t want to disappoint the crowd ! Fancy
a red-hot favorite for a big horse race cantering a quarter
of a mile, then pulling off with the announcement that
the committee had &iven the owner a sum just to
start the horse, as the attendance would not have been as
large if the horse had been scratched earlier in the day
thousands coming only to see and back this particular
horse. Tins is no overdrawn simile. Bookmakers were
laying the odds on the ground; and the writer actually
saw some of the clever division in the members’ stand go
out and back Parsons as soon as they got the “office”
that Zimmy really could not race. The league has done
itself a lot of injury over the affair, and outsiders are
beginning to hold their noses.
* ♦ ♦ *
Zimmerman had a perfect right to name his
price to the M.P.C. for appearing in the Austral, and the
club had an equally perfect right to refuse. Zim named
his price to the N.S. VV. Wheelmen’s League, and that body
seems to have sat down and signed articles without
giving Zim. time to think again. The League came out
of the venture with £l7OO clear profit, and presented
Zim. with a £lOO bonus in addition to the stipulated
terms. Zimmerman was a magnificent draw in Sydney
and that the M. 8.0. regard him as <j, bio- draw is
evidenced by their billing him as having entered for the
Austral, while lie publicly denies it, anH challenges
them to produce evidence of his having entered.
Later, when be gets well, he is going to hold a
Zimmerman carnival considerably “on his own” in
Melbourne, and this act will administer the coup-de-ordce
to the M. B.C.’s chance of making anything out of Zim.
Well, hasn’t the cash-amateur only himself to
blame? He devised the subtle cash scheme to feather his
own nest, and never dreamt of the Yank, coming along
and turning the cash system to fullest advantage. Given
fair handicaps and good prizes, all the cash-amateurs will
Jtg anywhere. That’s one of the sport issues of the game.
Zimmerman, say his detractors, doesn’t cycle
from the sporting standpoint. He races for cash. Well
the Australians planted that system here, not Zimmer-

The locally-made bicycle is making itself known
round Melh. Several firms have started, and some
good machines are being turned out. One man, a favorite
for last, year’s Austral, and on the 200yds. mark in this,
has taken to a local machine. He won in great style on
it at a recent meeting, and has declared he would ride it
in the Austral. A few nights afterwards he was, for some i
vague reason or other, “ wiped out” for a month, thus
precluding him from the big event. He had refused £lO
from an importing firm to “stand off ” the local article.

Saturday brought out a rare field of high-bred youngsters.
Huret, by Cranbrook —Zante, owing to superior condi-
tion, managed to dispose of Mosaic (Abercorn and Moon-
stone) and 21 others, several of which may be expected to
turn the tables on their conqueror before many months
are over. Gulliver (by Marvellous), a half-brother to Hop-
scotch, promises to prove a good one, whilst Triumph
(Abercorn— Trafalgar), Reward (Nordenteldt—The Gift),
and Absolution, a beautiful filly by the Australian Peer
from Penitent, are certain to make names for themselves.

Q. Assembly has decisively rejected (by 38 to 9)
Jack Hamilton’s Bill to give further lease of life
to the sweep-man. For a week before the division
Brisbane was full of vague rumors of bribery and corrup-
tion ; but nothing tangible has come to light. Anyhow,
the consultation - holder is now' definitely driven to
Noumea, though how he will prosper there remains to be
seen.
* * » *
In Q. Assembly discussion on Hamilton’s Bill
to permit consultations, Col. Sec. Washingtozer piously
declared that “ no nation which descended to the crime
of gambling ever prospered, and he did not think that
Queensland would so prosper.” Yet for the last three or
four years every tote in the province has been run by
direct authority from the Govt., and a percentage of
every tote-dividend has been taxed into the State
Treasury 1

“ Scrip ” : Not only is an Australian book on
horse-breeding badly wanted, but also regular publication
of a stud book. At present it appears spasmodically.
Yol. v. was published in '93, and it is now' announced
that vol. vi. can’t be brought out before the spring of
’97. The apathy of the big race clubs, and their ap-
parent reluctance to vote a decent subsidy, ate the main
and only reasons. A four-years' halt is ridiculous, and
renders the work practically useless. This year’s two-
year-olds are, of course, not quoted in the last volume,
nor are Wallace, Auraria and others mentioned by name.
The M.L. authorities have decided to merge theirs into
an Australasian production, if one is arranged for, the
printing of a volume of their own involving loss. The
idea of Australia being unable to support an official
stud record is simply—well, a great many things.
At least half-a-dozen good horses are suffering
from knock-outs sustained at Flemington carnival. The
hacks of the turf never seem to suffer in this respect.
They start in big handicaps and do their duty.
Adelaide books are already snatching easy coin
over the alluring Newmarket— Ans. Cup double of Hova
and Wallace ; 500 to 5, was the first pencilled.
Big English bookies have been knocked so hard
lately that some are inclined to pull down the blinds.
One declares a loss of £50,000 since the season opened.
Starting-price system is mainly responsible. The Austra-
lian Ikey Mo doesn’t go “stony” through post-betting. He
lays the alliterative, dream or fancy double, and invokes
the turf joss to trip up the packed fe-ald, or send a heavy
rain to save his little crop. Everyone prays for rain in
this depraved country.
Euroclydon smashed the Australasian record for
Similes in Canterbury (M.L.) Cup. The time, 3.57 f,
comes within IJsec. of the world’s record (Amer.). The
first mile was done in 1.43 i, mile and a half in 2.38 J, and
IJmiies in 3.5 f.
The hot impost of 9st. 131 b, allotted Waterfall
in Queensland Cup isn’t likely to induce his starting.
The colt is not built on the grand-stand-carrying prin-
ciple.
Jockey Derrett has now ridden the winner of
Canterbury (M.L.) Oaks six years in succession—a neat
record. Derrett piloted Carbine when the great gun
went under to Ensign as a three-year old.
One Adelaideian has a nasty Melb. Cup experi-
ence He “picked” Auraria, and thereby acquired bank-
notes to the extent of £5OO ; but upon arrival at Spencer-
st. from the course he found, to his horror, that he had
been pocket-picked of the whole amount.

Mr Alex. Mackellar, the just and popular chair-
man of the A.J.0., has resigned, and is worthily succeeded
by Mr. Henry Cary Dangar. Mr. Adrian Knox aspires to
Mr. Mackellar’s place on the committee, which in all
respects he is eminently fitted to fill.
* ♦ * •
If the Britishers want proof of the efficacy of
the starting-barrier, they cannot have anything better
than the fact that the jockeys’ fines have now fallen to
almost nil in Australasia.

The sprints at the Melb. Hibernians’ fete were
lud'-ed by Baird’s automatic judging-raachine, and
though some close finishes occurred, the machine s ver-
dict was never once questioned. The thing is so far a
success that Stawell Athletic Club, the strongest in Vic.,
has declared for it, and several other sports-promoters are
following suit. Baird, a Sydney boy and ex-secretary of
the Forest Lodge Harriers, is syndicating the affair to
exploit America and Europe.
In Melbourne recently a pedestrian was dis-
Qualified as an amateur because he had competed for and
won a race amongst half a dozen others at a picnic for the
usual “ bob in and winner shouts.”
Tom Reeves, of Barrington, the 1891 champion,
won the "Champion Chop of the World’' at the Tas-
manian Axemen’s Carnival, last week. Time, for 2ft.
standing block, 4min. 50sec. Reeves is 35 years of age,
and a native of Tasmania, weighs 12st. 51b., and is a
farmer by occupation. He wears a light-yellow moustache
of surprising length—and, chopping, he wears little else.
The Maiden Chop, also the Handicap, was won by Edward
Martin, a 13st. protbgb of Reeves, who considers Martin
the coming champion. Reeves modestly assured the
writer that his axe, a Plum of exquisite temper,
won him the Champion. Martin, in the Maiden and
Handicap, used the same axe. It originally cost 65., and
if put up for sale on Champion-day would have brought
£lO.
Smedley (Vic.) won the paling-splitting contest
(Tas.). He also won last year and from the same man—
Williams, of Tasmania. Fifty' five-feet palings in 9min.
lOsec. The champion sawing-match was won by Petitt —
a 2ft. log in Imin. 55sec., beating Chatwin on the last
splinter. This was a magnificent exhibition of strength
and skill. Bryan (Vic.), last year’s champion chopper,
was nowhere in this year’s conte -ts. He has not fallen
off, but Reeves and the others have improved.
• * ♦ *
The most desperate attempt on record to stop a
favorite was made at Mentone (Vic.) recently. The trot,
for which Leithamstead, a mere foal of 19 or 22 summers,
was a 6 to 4 favorite, was a perfect funeral most of the
way. Several of the other riders seemed to have great
consideration for the old ’un’s feelings, and it looked as
if he was going to win easily. Just as he turned into the
straight for home, however, a crowd of flatites suddenly
rushed out, and by means of shrieks, fist-shakings, &c.,
tried to stop him. Leithamstead’s rider, who didn’t fancy
being “shooed,” whipped his mount up, and fairly gal-
loped over the mob and past the post, closely followed by
the second favorite, Austral, the others stopping—owing,
as their drivers alleged, to their intense astonishment (as
if a trot-driver could be astonished at anything). The
second horse’s party protested against the winner for
galloping past the post, but the stewards ruled them out,
although, in the opinion of nine out of ten onlookers, he
did so. The winner's driver now opines that the whole
affair was an accident, the consequence of a rush to catch
the first train home. The affair recalls an incident at
Richmond (Vic.) pony-races some time ago, when an irate
bookie, seeing the favorite winning, hurled his overcoat
at it and nearly knocked the jockey off his perch.

No amateur sculler exists in Vic. who can travel
fast enough to keep “ Ted ” Powell, the lanky stroke of
the Albert Park four, comfortably warm. The Vic.
sculling championship on the Lower Yarra, last Saturday,
resolved itself into almost a farcical proceeding: Powell
literally paddled along the whole distance of three miles
odd, George Brown, the Essendon R.C. representative,
making a hideous attempt to keep somewhere in his
wake. Hamble, a powerful and symmetrical young
fellow who ought to scull well on his build, was left
hopelessly in the rear. Powell it was who surprised
everybody at Brisbane last March by beating Slack, Lam-
bert and other tip-top amateurs for the Australian
Amateur Championship.
“ Jack ” Dempsey, the “ Nonpareil ” American
pug, whose first 40 battles were fought without a defeat,
is dead.
Mountcastle and Son, the well-known
Sydney hatters, are ready for the Xmas season
with an unusually fine stock of all kindls of^ head-
gear. The average man, these days, doesn t want
to wear his hair, let alone a hat; ie yeaui.

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mrs. M. A. Cumming, of
Victoria* Australia, says;
“About it year ago, I had a severe attack
Of Influenza, Which left me very weak, with-
out energy, appetite, or interest in life. Ob-
taining little or no relief from doctors, or
from the many remedies recommended to me,
I finally tried Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, and from
that time, I began to gain health and strength.
I continued the treatment until fully recov-
ered, and now have very great pleasure in
telling my friends of the merits of Ayer’s Sar-
saparilla, and the happy results of its use. I
consider it the best blood-purifier known.”

EXTRACTS
FROM
PRIVATE LETTERS.
“ It is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to toll you of the
great benefit, my little daugh-
ter Gladys has derived from
‘Bengors Food.' The doctor
and all who saw her thought
we should never he able to
rear her. We took her totho
hospital, and tire authori-
ties recommended ‘ Benger’s
Food.' From that time she
began to pick up flesh and
strength."
"If every mother knew of
its value no other would be

poisoning has the same symptoms as alcoholism.
“ Spitting sixpences ” in the morning, vomiting,
lack of appetite* disgust for food, cramps in the
calves of the legs, pains in the limbs, twitchings
of the lips, cramp in the neck-muscles,
A hint to beer-sharks. A few years
since there was a murder - and - suicide epi-
demic in Victoria. The dai y tragedy was looked
for and thus exploited in more than one town by
Yankee Ned. At sunrise he would enter a ph ,to-
grapher’s shop, call the operator aside, and say*
“If you want to make a pound or two, take me
off quick. I’ll be a prisoner in an hour. I believe
I’ve murdered my mate. The police are now
after me, and I’m going to give myself up.” He
always knocked out a shilling or so to get break-
fast and drinks.
At Bundaberg (Q.), a sugar-growing centre
where tbe cheap and reliable nigger congregates,
1000 or more Kanaka savages come into the town
every Saturday. A large proportion grow drunk
and outrageous, and, in the pathetic language of
the mayor, “they are becoming very bold and
daring, breaking into private persons’ houses,
being found in females’ bedrooms, ransacking
householders’ drawing-rooms and flinging the con-
tents of the rooms about.” Also, it is reported
that these 1000 or 1200 armed and murky
brethren are at last dropping to the fact that
tribal fights don't pay—there is no plunder in the
business, and instead they contemplate having a
grand combined shindy "with the white inhabi-
tants of Bundaberg. There are. only about 800
able-bodied adult males in the town, and, con-
sidering their scattered condition, the niggers
should be able to sack Bundaberg and set it on
tire, and have a high time among the ruins.
Everything depends on whether the Kanakas
r.-ally mean business ; if they do they can surprise
Bundaberg almost any night and practise canni-
balism in the main street before the flabbergasted
inhabitants have time to tally.
jNow that the strychnine treatment tor
snakebite is so widely believed in, one word of
warning for owners of pocket cases : Strychnine
injections should not be employed till unmistake-
able symptoms of poisoning are manifest. Re-
member that only a small percentage of bites are
fatal, because the glands do not always contain
anything like a fatal dose for man. If there is
not enough venom in the blood to counteract the
strychnine, the patient may die of the latter. A
case of a snakebite person dying with marked
strychnine symptoms was reported in the dailies
a few days back.
Apropos of the alleged inability of white
men to stand a tropical clime. There is in Central
America only one fairly-prosperous little State —
Costa Rica. The people are, mostly, yeomen
farmers—pauperism and vagrancy are rare. The
inhabitants are mainly pure-blooded Caucasians
of Spanish descent, and successfully cultivate
their own little banana patches in the burn-
ing heat of the Tierra Caliente. They have
one great failing—drunkenness, inevitable con-
comitant of working-class prosperity.
One Vic. woman is an undertaker, and
another a “ nightman,” Sydney has two female
undertakers.

The well-known and popular representative of the Sydney Bulletin, a gentleman whoso testi-
mony carries special weight, writes thus : To Herr Rassmusskn. —Dear Sir, —I think it my duty to
inform you that a course of your Alfaline Vitality Pills acted very beneficially on my nervous system,

Sir,—l hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debilitv of the Nervous'System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading doctors both in

I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
lam now completely cured, and 1 shall be most happy to recommend
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me,

this. Wishing you every success, allow me to remain, yours,

Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 1871 I was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When Icarneto Sydney I had a
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of your Pills ; since then I tiave used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and lam now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that your Alfaline
Remedies have acted most wonderful in my case, and I consider that

whom 1 have recommended their use. I consider they are far more
efficacious than any remedy yet brought before the public. I consider
you are second to none as a human benefactor.
I am, yours truly, EDWARD DREW.

Pursey Chirnside, of the 31 colored waist-
coats, is really too exquisite. Speaking on the
new Franchise Bill in Yic. Parliament, he said he
should vote for the meashah this time, as he was
pledged to do so, but should not support it in any
succeeding I arliament. Mr. Chirnside is appar-
ently under the delusion that a “one-man-one-
voW” Bill is introduced every year or so. The
reason for Pursey’s amusing declaration is that he
promised to support the Bill under a misapprc-
Fiensio\ : he was asked at a meeting whether ho
would vote for “ one-man-one-vote, ’’ and replied —
“Yaas, At think every man ought to have a
vote!’’ He didn't know what one-man-one-v< .to
meant, and when it was explained to him what he
had done, ho was horrified.

A GRAND LITERARY INSTITUTION.
Cole’s Book Arcade now runs from the centre
of the block in Bourke-street to the centre of the
block in Collins-street, Melb., a distance of 660ft.,
and contains the following 17 departments, mostly
literary and artistic : 1, New Books; 2, Second-
hand Books ; 3, Stationery ; 4, Music ; 5, Fancy

The One-adult-one-vote Bill went through
the Vic. Assembly flying. On its last night the
benighted MTntyre moved for the dual vote, and
found himself with a majority of 37 against him.
Madden then wanted to give an extra vote to
everyone who paid income-tax ; this was defeated
on the voices. One-man-one-vote was carried ;
and then the one-woman-one-vote clause came for-
ward, and a straight-out vote was taken, with the
result that it was carried by a majority of 28.
Burton and Kirton then wanted to submit the
idea to a referendum. Madden and Murray Smith
immediately declared, consistently enough, that
they would not touch the unclean referendum. It
was decided not to refer the idea to the “electors,”
and immediately afterwards not to refer it to the
“ adult women ” by a majority of 19. The whole
Bill was then passed without more trouble, and
put at the mercy of the J/inions of .Legalised
Capital.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion toobtain
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
an 1 we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful under circumstances which undoubtedly
prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 59 other leading residents.
“Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“ Dear Sir,—Some months ago my little boy gob
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it; he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
—Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Everton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis Cure? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure.—J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“Dear Sir, —I had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it.—Yours faithfully, J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-

Row’s Assorted Bitters
CONTAIN
Row’s Dandelion Bitters.
We recommend these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Liver.
See what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY

=— —Buchii Bitters.
BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinary
Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid Irrita-
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from
the loss of tone in the parts concerned in its evacuation.
These Bitters I also recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chronic
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.
Read what Medical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D. : —The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in oases
of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D.—BBBB—I find these Bitters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. I therefore thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D.—lt is the purest of Bitters, and
exerts a peculiar influence over the liver.

STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.

“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare as follows :
‘ 4 That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.

All who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon
be cured by these Bitters, taken three times a day
before meals.
Row’s Oriental Bitters.
A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumbler ot
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagne.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
eneral depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROW’S STEANEf WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will sati-fy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti febrile is unsur-
passed.

Various Verses .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE ANARCHIST.
We trumpet a note to the hearts of men,
A note to stir them to freedom and life,
A note to sound in the darkest den
Where sorrow and sickness and sin are rife,
To peal in the poorest of prostrate souls
And call them back to their own lost right,
To blare and burst where the war-drum rolls,
And riot and ring in the rage of fight.
A trumpet message to tell the earth
That its creeds decay and its gods are dead,
That its laws and its lying have lost their worth,
That the reign of rapine and wrong is sped ;
That a sun, blood-red with a cycle’s pain,
Is risen to wither their world away,
That a new light gleams o’er an altered fane,
That a new soul breathes in our quickened clay.
It is time that men should arise from sleep,
It is time for the dead to be vivified,
For human creatures to cease to creep
In abject fear ’neath the heels of pride.
On their coward hearts has the cold lain long,
While their limbs were lax and their lips were
dumb ;
But their hearts wake warm to the trumpet’s song,
And their arms uplifted to vengeance come.
The hueless mist of unchanging woe,
That has folded them round since first they saw,
Is bright with a coming Freedom’s glow.
Is shot with the sheen of the steel they draw.
They are wakening fast to a higher thing
Than service and suffering, sin and sweat;
And the trump shall call till its deep notes ring
In the dull slave-souls that are wavering yet.

HIS RIVAL
He comes whenever you are gone,
And I am left to weep alone.
He sneers not that my cheek is wan,
But takes my tired hands in his own.
He whispers tales of days now dim,
Ere love had fled, deceiving elf;
He is your only rival, Jim—
This vision of your former self.

AN OLD ROOM.
A room unswept and littered —
Spider-webs hang from the walls ;
The air with all this dust—decay—bittered—
In dust the ceiling falls.
Stains as of blood on hearth and skirtings—
The curtains torn to shreds.
This is the room of dancings gone, and flirtings,
And passions worn to threads.
Upon that bed my bride of dreams, in languor,
Lay waiting for the groom.
My bride of dreams is dead ! —no lusty clangor
Of nuptial-bells vibrates that mourning room !
A mouse runs often in that leaden quiet,
And makes my flesh to start!
An old thought is the mouse that makes the riot —
The old room is—my heart!

Dufferin is held in readiness to take the

wrought.
N.S. Wales deaths from cancer are in-
creasing more rapidly per 100,000 persons living
than any other province’s, though Maoriland runs
N.S.W. very close, with Queensland, S.A. and
Vic. following in that order. But, strange to say,
Tas., formerly the most cancerous of the Aus-
tralias, has now a steadily decreasing death-rate.
A Sydney daily says that in sentencing
abortionist Sheridan to death Mr. Justice Simp-
son “did not assume the blackcap.” Surely a
new-chum hath written this ! Australian Judges
don’t wear the black cap, and sometimes his Aus-
tralian Hqnor even forgets the stereotyped prayer
for mercy on the culprit’s soul. Once Judge
Williams the elder told a man that he “ did not
think he was worth praying for,” so much levity
did prisoner, who was connected with an allegedly
noble family in England, display in the dock.
This man, who was convicted of child-murder,
was reprieved on the ground of insanity. Twelve
years afterwards he recovered his senses and
claimed his freedom, but was refused on the
ground that he was a life-prisoner.

“TALES OF THE SYSTEM.
Writes an Australian visitor from Scot-
land;—“l went into a small shop to buy some
trifling presents for the youngsters. Almost
everything I handled was foreign-made. Even
photos of Scottish scenery had actually been pre-
pared and mounted in France or Germany ! ”
The only known cure for influenza is Cole-
mane and Sons Eucalypte Extract.
The bill to legalise cremation, under
cemetery management, is likely to pass through
Vic. Log. Council without much opposition.
Cremation, it seems, is favoured by several local
citizens of financial standing, who have come to
the conclusion that a fiery doom can’t be avoided.
At a recent temperance meeting in Balla-
rat a local councillor —who is also a publican-
rose up and, thumping his chest and tapping his
beetling brow, requested the audience to compare
him with some of the teetotallers present whom a
puff of wind would blow away.—
The pothouse-man began to bluff,
Teetotallers might with a puff
Of wind be blown away, like snuff,
He said (it was a statement tough)
Through drinking water—wretched stuff
Instead of wholesome beer.
“ Beer,” said he, “ is your only drink—
It makes you eat, it makes you think."
He tapped his brow’—said, with a wink
“ I have a hogshead here.”

Tommy Armstrong’s Last Fight.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tommy Armstrong was a native of Vic-
toria, whose father battered the lad’s mother to
death. Taking grisly vengeance, Tommy fled
from Melbourne to India, there enlisting in
H.M.’s Canary Bird Dragoon Guards. That
story was told in The Bulletin. This is the tale
of his last fight.
* * *
Orderly Room wg,s over, but the Colonel
held private inspection of the men—salt of the
Canaries—selected to hold up the glory of the
corps at the assault-at-arms, Poonah. To that
pageant went skilled fighting-men, white, yellow,
and brown, from uttermost parts of Bombay
Presidency and beyond—picked British men-at-
arms, artillery, horse and foot, gorgeous in scarlet
and purple, ablaze with gold, furbished brass and
burnished steel; Mahratta horsemen, in sky-blue
and silver; bearded and bronzed irregular cavalry
of Scinde, with green tunics and great turbans ;
haughty Rajpoots, troopers by rank, by birth
princes and sons of warriors, sitting sphinx-like
man-eating stallions; men of the Contingent
of the Nizam at Hyderabad, barbarieally
accoutred ; native swordsmen, nigh naked,
from East, North, and Deccan, whose tul-
wars, suppler and swifter than venomed cobra,
whinnied when naked and whirling like war-
horses that sniff carnage; native wrestlers,
slippery as eels, lithe as cheetahs. Small wonder
the Colonel, holding “my regiment” fit body-
guard for the Almighty, scanned his gladiators,
ere sending them into such company, with eyes
aflame for blemish.
* • •
He exuded precept. They were never to
stir out in Poonah, save with whips, gloves and
the regimental lord-of-all-this-earth swagger.
They were not to drink with foot-soldiers. Nor
to get excessively drunk. “ Yet, if perchance
you do, I conjure you by your hopes of immor-
tality to suffer no damnable and degraded in-
fantry picket to take you to the guard-room.”
And, turning to Tommy :
“The 158th officers at Poonah have anew boxer
whom they are backing heavily against you. You
can beat him, I know. But should it be that,
through jealousy of my regiment, the judges give
the points against you—you know what I shall
expect! ”
There are things Colonels don’t say. All there
understood that Tommy could only atone a glove-
defeat by smashing the victor with bare knuckles.
Finally, the Colonel: —.
“If any man is dishonorably defeated, he would
do well to go straight from Poonah to Paradise.
But ’twere better he should go straight to hell
than return to my regiment! ” The colonel,
grandiloquent profanity notwithstanding, meant
these things.
* m •
At sunrise the detachment, with bullock
haeharis and elephants, and amid ape-like chatter
of native followers, paraded for their six days’
march. The Canaries cheered them out of canton-
ments, pressing on them rupees saved with great
sweat of resolution from the canteen, Parsee sly-
grog sellers, and 10l bazar, to back Tommy, their
never - vanquished fighter. For the Canaries,
having both champion rider and swordsman,
valued mure highly Tommy’s triumphs. A score
of superb horsemen and a few fine swordsmen may
be found in every cavalry corps. But a man who
had for years “ knocked-out ” every antagonist,
was clearly the benefaction of an appreciative
Providence.
# • #
So the party, under command of the
riding-master—regimentally christened “Ginger,”
owing to the occasional color of his hair when his
dyes arrived irregularly—louped happily down
the road, rejoiced at never so slight a break in
the creeping paralysis called, in India, life. The
party consisted of some dozen non-coms, and
men. Four only—Tommy, his comrade and
trainer, “ Lob ” Martin, Charlie Herbert and Joe
Plod, concern this relation.
« • •
Between the first two, known as the twins
and both Australians, was the blood brotherhood
of common fatherland. Lob, a Sydney-side
stockrider, had, five years before, brought horses
to Calcutta, rounding a gargantuan spree by en-
listing in a Hussar regiment in Bengal, from
which, a few months antecedent to this story, he
volunteered to the Canaries, leaping into popular
esteem as one of the best-tempered, most generous
and most magnificently careless dragoons that
ever answered “ boots and saddles.” Though an
unsurpassable rough and ready soldier, and a fora-
ger so gifted that he would have found and stolen
rum, fowls and horsefeed in the heart’s core of
Sahara, he ignored mere barrack-room soldiering,
and extended, even to the grim Colonel, a fine
democratic affability devoid of awe. Much,
however, could be pardoned a man ever
ready for roughest duty, and whose cheery
devilment kept his comrades amiable. Herbert,
a veteran of 15 years’ service and war-scarred in
unknown fields ere ever he joined the Canaries,
was a gentleman-ranker with a previous history of
which he gave no hint. He was the Nestor of his
corps, to whom every man suffering from love or
liquor went for shrewd counsel. Between Tommy
and Lob and himself there existed as near
approach to fellowship as the veteran permitted
living man. Joe Plod was a loyal comrade with
a highly-developed thirst, but otherwise not
remarkable. These four, on arrival at Poonah,
were told off to a small bungalow by themselves.
Else this story had not been written.
* # «
Next day the party made entry for the
various competitions. Lob, who had accompanied
the detachment merely as Tommy’s trainer, was
destined to afford his comrades several surprises
at first largely tempered with amused scorn.
“Sword against Bayonet; any entries?” sang
out the non.-corn. in charge.
“ Put me down ” —from Lob.
“ Bayonet against Sword ? ”
“I’ll buck at that”—from Lob.
“You blessed, long-tailed hussar —what d’you
know about a bayonet ? ’’ grumbled Tommy.
“ Sword against Lance ? ”
“ Put Martin down.”
“ Lance against Sword ? ”
“ I'll take a buck at that, too,” responded
Martin, amid derisive guffaws.
“Lead-cutting? Better buck at that, Martin.”
“ My word 1 ” said Lobs.
“This beast,” remarked Tommy, oracularly,
“ must have been drinking Billy Stink before
breakfast.”
Next day, however, honeyed words superseded
delicate irony. The competitors proved too
numerous to compete at the assault before the
Commander-in-chief, a glorified staff, and bat-
talions of jewelled princes and rajahs. Pre-
liminary and weeding competitions were there-
fore arranged. The much-bantered Lob came out
winner of all his heats. Ginger, shiny with plea-
sure and pomposity, enthusively complimented
him. “ Only,” he said, “ for God’s sake, no drink-
ing—until it’s all over.”
• • •
The afternoon saw the preliminary box-
mg competitions. The light and middle-weights
had all sparred. Said the superintendent. You
have established blue funk among the heavy
Armstrong, have all withdrawn.
Our man ,aS officer. .
Well, where is he. Have you got him in
cotton-wool. Who knows anything about him .
¥ou d better order him here for a dress-rehearsal
® l ar Pi. . . , .
1 he officer sent a message to his mess.
Mea,nwhile the handful of officers and com pet i-
tors left in the gymnasium were keen to see the
unknown who had been secretly trained and
heavily backed by the mess of 158th to lower
Armstrong’s colors. For this meant no ordinary
’scrap. It was a pitting of cavalry against
infantry. The ancient contempt and jealousy—
old as the day the first man went killing on a
horse flamed out. I he horseman s contempt for
the footman; the jealousy a soldier doomed to
plod feels of the soldier privileged to prance.
• * *
A grin deepening to laughter went round
as two big subalterns entered convoying a dimi-
nutive rear-rank man, the aggressive crimson of
whose liquor-tinted nose even rigid training had
not bleached to ruin-eschewing pink. Save for a
ruffling swagger, he was the antithesis of the con-
ventioual boxer. About five-feet-five, clad in
dirty ducks and pea jacket, a blazing red’kerchief
twisted around his throat, his black, bullet-head
close-cropped, his beard ample, he looked what he
was—a crapulous packet-rat, from the dens of
Flag-street, Calcutta, turned soldier. But when
he had unwound his neck-rag and pitched off
his jacket, Martin, watching Herbert for inspira-
tion, noted the latter hardly looked amused or
pleased. Though short in stature, the ex-sailor’s
shaggy chest was enormous; his arms, hardened
by rope-hauling, were long as a giant’s, hairy and
ape-like ; the forearm wide, flat and almost flesh-
less, sinewy as a gorilla’s—deltoid and trapezius
enormously developed.
His name was Dawe. _ _
Handed the gloves, Dawe plunged his big fists
into them, ferociously agog to begin.
* * *
His mode of “shaping” was as uncon-
ventional as his appearance. He stood, queerly
bunched, three yards from Armstrong.
“ Get closer to your man,” said the super.
*! own wa y> s ’ r,, 1 ’ „
Tommy 11 get near enough to him presently,
Cb ( U <m- .mi, j ~
lime . called the super.
* * + *
Like sudden death, Dawe whirled himself
at the other, hitting him right and left, blows
over the heart which,, notwithstanding gloves,
sounded like horse-kicks on deal boards. Dodging
the return, which was wild and wide, he hit
Tommy another tremendous thump on the throat
and got away grinning and untouched, with the
rapidity of a conjuring-trick. No man could take
three such blows calmly. Tommy, more than a
little dazed, started to force in-fighting. He
might as easily have cornered an unchained ape.
Dawe continued to rush, hit—always about the
same spots, heart and jugular—and get away,
with at worst half-spent blows. It verged towards
monotony. The half-dozen Canaries present ab
first thought Armstrong was playing the other
out; then concluded their man would sicken first,
Dawe evidently worked a plan familiar to him —
pitting his terrific hitting-power and agility
K .„gi„ g
behind Lob) he wl ,i apered> “Good God! has
Armstrong been drinking? He doesn’t seem to
see that fellow. He’s late every time ! ”
<< Hasn’t tasted for months, sir.”
At last a change ! Dawe bunched for the usual
rusb- This time Tommy went to meet him, and
g ot j n a crashing upper-cut which lifted the other
c j ean o ff bis feet, landing him on his head. The
blow and fall would have stunned anything bub
a fighting-ram or a sailor used to being banged
w iron-bound snatch-blocks. Dawe was up,
bleeding, instantaneously, and again launched him-
sejf a g a j nS (, Armstrong who, however, met him
w jth a knock-down right-hander.
Here the super, intervened. “Stop it!” he
touted. “ This is getting a glove-fight. Put on
your iackets.”
“ Give you two to one in ponies?” said a 158th
su b a ltern to Ginger, who was strutting out red and
wra tbful
“ Done with you, sir,” snapped the riding-
master. But his expression was not enthusiastic.
* * *
Tommy sat on his cot, his arms folded,
gazing doggedly on the floor—six feet of humilia-
tion and despair. He knew that he was already
practically beaten. Lob had fled, too miserable
to f ace his chum. Herbert smoked gravely and
silently. An hour passed thus. Then Armstrong,
oblivious of the other’s presence, muttered:
“ Well, if I’m licked, I can always shoot myself.”
“So can any fool,” said Herbert,
Tommy looked up sullenly. “ Well, what did
you think of it?”
“I didn’t think. I knew."
“Knew what?”
“Come here to the light. Stand there! Now,
how far off do I seem to you? ”
“Twelve feet—more.”
“Just so. I’m three! How long have you
been blind like this? ”
“ Six months.”
“ Why didn’t you go to hospital ? ”
“Why? Do you think I wanted to be invalided
—t G leave the only home and friends I ever had? ”
“I understand. Now, Armstrong, promise as
man to man you won’t go fooling with any
infantryman’s rifle till you’ve spoken to me
again.”
The other hesitated long. “I promise.”
• # •
Remaining events are involved in much
obscur ity. Herbert, Martin, and Plod held that
afternoon anxious conferences. Eventually
Herbert and Plod crossed to the 158th canteen.
There, with certain choice spirits, leaders of regi-
mental public opinion, they arranged a fight
(without gloves) between Dawe and Armstrong
for the following night at moon-up ; the affair to
be kept secret till over; only twelve persons to
attend. Negotiation was simplified by the ramp-
ing madness of the 158th men at the secresy
observed by their officers, and by the restivenes

of Dawe under conditions of unwonted sobriety.
Strange to say, the ambassadors omitted to men-
tion their mission to Tommy, though Herbert
remarked to him, “ I fancy you’ll fix that toe
soldier, when it comes to the Assault.” This on
Tuesday. The fight was for Wednesday; the
Assault for Thursday.
# • •
It was also strange that the four Canaries
“ on pass ” visited a Farsee grog-shop on Wednes-
day afternoon and engaged in an orgie, com-
mencing with bottled ale, terminating with
brandy, port, and champagne. It was even
stranger that three out of the four rose from the
symposium far soberer than most Judges after
dinner. The fourth was “ paralytic drunk.” He,
with secrecy, was carried at dusk, by devious
ways, to the bungalow and there left to sleep.
The fight occurred. But the Armstrong of that
battle proved an altogether different antagonist.
Moonlight seemed to suit his sight. Dawe’s
rushes did not come off; the other forced the
fighting. After 20 desperate rounds—both men
being battered, Dawe to insensibility—the 158th
threw up the sponge,
• « •
The proceedings of the three Canaries on
their return were culpable. They pulled the
drunken man to his feet, held, hustled, and hit
him (not severely). They shouted war-cries in his
ears; but, after he had unconsciously delivered
wild thumps into vacancy, permitted him to sub-
side, with a bleeding nose, upon his cot. After
emptying several bottles they fell asleep, cachin-
nating idiotically.
« • •
Incredible as it may seem, Tommy, next
morning, had completely forgotten the fight of the
night before. He had much gore on his singlet,
was stiff, somewhat bruised, and had “a head.”
But, whenever he indulged, which was rarely, he
invariably forgot the proceedings. Herbert elo-
quently described the fight, and then Tommy had
a vague remembrance of hitting and being |hit.
However, his victory was all over Poonah by
8 a.m. The 158th officers blasphemed when they
saw Dawe’s condition. Tommy easily knocked
him out in three rounds at the Assault. But
Martin was so damaged about the body by—so it
was alleged-falling when drunk, that he had to
withdraw from all competitions, to the sorrow of
Ginger and the unutterable and unappeasable
wrath of the colonel on the return of the party.
* * #
But months after, when the regimental
s irgeon had mended Tommy’s eyes and there w r as
no danger of him being invalided, Charlie Herbert
made a communication to his commanding officer,
with the result that Private Martin was sent for
to Orderly Room. The colonel received him
standing. A colonel seldom stands on his own
midden. He said : “ Sergeant Martin, facts have
just come to my knowledge which convince me I
have done you gross injustice. I beg your pardon.
You saved the honor of the regiment. You acted,
that time at Poonah, as a man—by God ! sir, like
a gentleman. I’ll never forget it.” And he never
did. And this is the story of Tommy’s last fight.

There are those who say it was Martin
who personated his chum and “ towney ” on that
moonlight night at Poonah. But then the Indian
climate favors tropic imagination.

Marriage: A Fable,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Down a long and dusty road a parched and tired
wayfarer passed beneath the rays of the noontide
sun. On either side of the road fair vineyards lay
cool and green in the summer heat, and the
clustering purple grapes hung in profusion beneath
the overhanging leaves.
Ever and anon the wayfarer cast longing glances
at the luscious fruit, but stern guardians kept
watch, and he feared to pluck lest he should be
observed.
At last, overcome with desire for the juicy
bunches, he approached a watcher and humbly
asked for one.
“Your request,” said the watcher, “will be
granted, but upon one condition.”
“Name it,” replied the thirsty traveller.
“ It is that you will bind yourself by oath to
eat a bunch every day for the remainder of your
life.”
The wayfarer shook his head. “Thanks, no,”
he said —“ I have been married.”
VAN DEMON.
Lex : N. S. W. J udges appear to have
settled comfortably down to a modification of
the law in damages cases. Frequently, when
a money verdict is awarded for injuries in-
flicted on a child, the Judge splits the
amount and confers one portion on the parents
and another on the child. The other day
Judge Murray did this with a paltry .£l5.
A girl had been bitten by a dog, and <£ls
was awarded as damages. His Honor decreed
that <£s of the amount should go to the parents
and the balance be put in the Savings Bank for
the child. Such a modification of the law may be
judicious at times; but whence does the Judge
derive the authority he exercises ? Further, is it
safe to leave such authority, without some defini-
tion of limits, in the keeping of Judges in general?

That worst of sheep diseases, fluke or
“ liver-rot ” or “ water-rot ’’—all three forms due
to the one parasite—now seems likely to be got
under control. Fluke has long been known to be
commonest in damp or marshy country, and least
common on well-drained high lands or hill sides, but
the significance of this was not thoroughly under-
stood till the life-history of fluke was worked out
by Prof. A. P. Thomas, of Auckland, M.L. The
adult fluke inhabits the bile-ducts of sheep, and
there lays minute oval eggs with thin, horny shells.
These eggs pass with the bile into the bowel,
and so with the dung to the ground. If dropped
in moist situations or in water, they go on
developing for a couple of weeks, till the embryo
is hatched. This embryo is conical in shape,
something like a rifle-bullet on a minute scale, the
blunt end being the head. It swims freely in
water till it meets with a fresh-water snail of a
special species, and then bores its way into
its body. Inside the snail the embryo develops
into a sort of sac, in which are produced forms
known as redice, minute worm-like beings which
inhabit chiefly the liver of their snail host. In-
side these redice are developed conical-shaped,
long-tailed embryos called cercarice, which work
their way out of the snail into water or damp
grass, and there affix themselves to grass or other
plants. Then they are swallowed by the sheep,
and so reach the liver to grow into flukes and pro-
duce disease. Put summarily—fluke lays eggs ;
hatched embryo gets into snail, passes through
t wo stages, and sets free a larval form; larva is
swallowed by sheep, and reaches adult stage in
bile-duct. Now, Prof. Thomas worked on
European flukes, and their snail host he found to
be the amphibious freshwater snail, Limnaa
truncatulus. But this snail is not found in Aus-
tralia, so local fluke evidently had a different snail
host. It was to seek out this unknown that Dr
Cobb, of N.S. W. Agricultural Dept., set to work
and he believes he has found it in the common or
garden snail. If this be so, the fluke problem
becomes much simplified. In the first place the
exact condition of pasturage on which young sheep
contract fluke must be experimentally determined,
Secondly, remedial measures must be devised-
drainage of damp land is certainly one, burning
o ff, which destroys both fluke embryos and snails is
certainly another; the encouragement of birds and
other natural enemies of snails is a third ; some
dressing for infected land, which would destroy
snails and embryos without affecting the sheep
would be a fourth ; and removal of diseased sheep
a fifth. Thus in the labors of scientists like
Thomas and Cobb is the solution of the so-called
“practical man’s” difficulty found, and so has it
ever been,

“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at SYDNEV, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly-vustralla’s Nonparell
Illialriitcd Newspaper.
“The bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours —
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Comolete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection agamsl
the World.

A State Rank, the issue of bank-notes to be
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia

rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System - one House to

the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers ol
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artist!
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless news paper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
arge fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerfu
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had al
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established A us-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the clabns of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, aeainst the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and tbe organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official— that
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than and
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.
