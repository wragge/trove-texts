Brisbane
Should be Included in Every National
Advertising Campaign
As a newspaper “The Sunday Mail” speaks for itself, and the average net
circulation for April (42,696), May (44,006) and June (46,300) bears testimony
to the ever-widening circle of readers of Queensland’s great Sunday news-
paper-magazine and to the ready appreciation with which it is received
wherever it goes.
The consistently increasing popularity of “The Sunday Mail” renders
necessary its inclusion in every national advertising campaign planned tor
the Queensland market. Used in conjunction with “The Courier Mail,
Queensland’s greatest daily, it gives a combination unequalled in coverage
and lowness of cost. Further particulars gladly supplied on request.

The Week’s Best: —
MONKEY GLANDS
FOR DECREPIT
OLD MAGIC
There is an air
of artifice about
Edward Sack-
ville West’s new
novel, The Sun
in Capricor n
(Heinemann ; Bs. 6d.). These mystical
emotional emanations smack of a writer
trying to force on to his medium tasks
beyond its nature or capacity, like those
photographs that try to be etchings.
It is much the same illusory light that
was followed by John Cowper Powys in
“A Glastonbury Romance,” a novel
considerably greater than this one, which
bears a distant family resemblance to
it. The delusion of both of them—
Powys and now West —is that fiction
may fake to itself the magical properties
and power of poetry, and it is poetry’s
revenge that both of them are finally be-
trayed into embracing, like a colonial
Dutchman his bolster, the shadow of a
forgotten and fabulous mysticism:
Powys, that of the Druids ; West, that of
Paracelsis.
The difference between them is largely
in the strength of their respective bol-
sters: Powys, artistically the stronger,
because Druidism, though rather overcast
by spiritism and other such fashionable
mumbo-jumbo of the moment, has, at
any rate, a relationship with trees and
shadows and the endless things of
nature ; West, a comparative failure, be-
cause poor old Paracelsis looks at this
time like a down-and-out conjurer who
has forgotten his silly tricks, and stands,
lonely and discredited, fingering his
tawdry dress on the stage of a neglected
theatre.
Taken seriously, nothing could be more
ridiculous than this attempt to fob poor
old P. off as a reality at this proletarian-
minded moment: it is difficult enough
to sustain reality about Aaron, a
better conjurer and more handsomely
dressed. The attempt must be accepted
simply as a desperate literary measure
forced by Poetry on a prose writer who
has presumed to take liberties with her
chaste self; though even then, accept-
ing the novel for what it is intended to
be —a fantasy-recital of contemporary
European social chaos—one could still
wish this tinny magic out of the way: it
darkens with a bewilderment of foolish
noises, ghost voices and ludicrous mani-
festations, and emanations and appari-
tions—a marvellous lot of hocus-pocus
pitifully necessary to the story’s develop-
ment.
OLD EUROPE
HAS
HYSTERICS
Stripped of
these tawdry mar-
vels, The Sun in
Capricorn is on
the way to being
a beautiful piece
of literature. In its greater places it is
alight with clear reality. The theme is
naive, but engaging ; the plan involved,
but not obscure: —Boyhood is a state of
natural anarchy ; most of us overpass
this in adolescence, accept our immediate
conventions and arc no longer attracted
v by or capable of enjoying the sadistic de-
lights of practical jokes. Those who fail
to complete this transition are the world’s
anarchists, disruptionists, gangsters, dic-
tators, and contemporary Europe is en-
joying the phenomenon of the presence
of such transitional failures in unprece-
dented numbers, a continent threatened
with anarchy, a hysterical place in which
emotionalism has run riot in a ghastly
romanticism; in short, the innocuous
anarchy of boyhood suddenly emerging
in manhood as something fierce and dan-
gerous, treating the world to the spec-
tacle of “the cult of the Nietzschean
adolescent trampling the social fabric
into the dust in a glorious semi-nude
progress towards an improbable sun.”
It may not be too much to read further
into the author’s intention that the credit
for this extraordinary triumph of adoles-
cence belongs to education, which is cap-
able of and intent upon bringing mental
food to the mass, but quite incapable of
supplying the organs of digestion. So
we have knowledge without understand-
ing and opportunity without wisdom, and
thus fall easily in the end to the tempta-
tion of satisfying personal interests, per-
ishing of selfishness.
The theme is developed mainly
through the agency of five characters,
intimates first in a schoolboy secret
society, and several of them subsequently
a secret organisation inflicting large-scale
practical jokes on society at large, the
simple object being to so disturb its
placid bearing that, no man trusting his
neighbor, chaos must ensue, and out of
chaos must come change, though whether
it shall be change for the better is not
dreamt of in their philosophy nor haz-
arded by the author. The pretty scheme
comes to an end through selfishness
among the plotters. Their temptation is
the magical crown and properties of
Paracel sis, a heirloom in the possession
of one of the group.
The novel may be too sensuously
imaginative and too experimental in
presentation for popular favor, but it
could be read merely as a good story of
incident and excitement, in which accept-
ance its magical junk might be an added
attraction. Or it might be read for the
fine clearness of its pictures, notably
those of English school life in the early
chapters, and, later, of the domestic life
of the anarchic intellectuals in their com-
fortless menage in France. Other readers
may appreciate the author’s courageous
analysis of difficult and complex char-
acter, and there is a sense of proportion
about the sex element, not a disregard-
ing of it, but its few encounters treated
with restraint, which, however, falls sen-
sibly on the right side of austerity.
WHITEWASH FOR
THE MARQUIS
DE SADE
The word “sad-
istic,” used in the
foregoing in the
sense of a disin-
terested enjoy-
ment of giving
hurt to others, is, made a bone for much
industrious gnawing in Geoffrey Gorer’s
The Revolutionary Ideas of the Marquis
tie Sade (Wishart; 135.). The substance
of the Gorer case for the Marquis is that,
as Professor J. B. S. Haldane puts it in
his introduction, De Sade was a very re-
markable and original thinker who in his
life suffered interested persecution and
imprisonment and punishment out of all
proportion to his crimes, and about
whose memory has arisen the monster
legend which it is Mr.
Gorer’s purpose to
dissipate.
De Sade, clearly
unbalanced, but vic-
tim also of an implac-
ably malicious ma-in-
law, and singularly
unlucky in the men-
dacity of his lawyers
and the prejudice of
his magistrates, spent
the best part of his
life in gaol and some
of it in a lunatic asy-
lum. In and out of
the State’s care, he
composed works so
extraordinarily
obscene that even to-
day, when much of
the veil of taboo over
such matters has

been lifted, the good guardians of
nnr fmtrilo minrk cfill cuffpr awful
our fragile minds still suiter awrui
fevers of apprehension on our be-
half at the mere mention of his name.
His greatest work—an astounding docu-
rnent of 150,000 words written in 37
ronspontive ovoninns in the Bastille in
consecutive evenings in rne uasmie, in
microscopic hand on both sides of a 13-
yard roll of sin.-wide paper, and expos-
ing every possible form of human de-
pravity—was not published until 120
years after his death (because it was lost
or stolen from him), and neither it nor
his lesser works are ever likely to be
made available to us.
We must be content with such indica-
tions of what those works really were as
are now given to us by one who has
examined them, and whose reading of
De Sade is that in any age he would
have suffered persecution by authority,
not for the wickedness of his personal
crimes, but for the supreme blasphemy
of stripping man of his every covering
and exposing him for the mean and loath-
some creature he is. The book, begin-
ning with a brief but engrossing bio-
graphical sketch, proceeds to/the exami-
nation of De Sade’s writings, his philo-
sophy and political thought, with closing
chapters comparing De Sade’s outlook
on sex with that of recent and contem-
porary psychologists.

An Artist
Hypnotised
One of the
most impressive
illustrations of
the hypnotic
effect of the
Marxist dialectic
on some minds is Katharine Susannah
Prichard.
In Australia Mrs. Prichard confined
herself to writing a series of artistic
stories and novels in which she was an
objective observer of human nature.
Since she has been to Russia she has
written a series of articles for Australian
papers, and they re-
veal a completely un-
thinking and untech
nical acceptance of
the Soviet religion of
scientific efficiency.
Her description of
Russia amounts ,to
little more than an
artless paean over its
industrial achieve-
ments. In describing
a great steel plant in
Siberia she lets her-
self go in this wise :
In the rolling mill,
rows of ingots were
standing ready for
their transformation
into axles, rails and
girders.
Huge square pil-
lars of slate-blut;
steel stripped of their
moulds weighing Irom six to seven tjns
dumb giants, obeying the will ol ihen who
look |jke pigmies besides them—gripped
by the ove rhead cranes, moved gently to

ingots, lifted them on to an electric car,
shifting a seven-ton ingot every ovo or
thre£ minutes as though it were made of
fluff Rose and ma uve, the ingots moved

A Revelation
in Relief of
STOMACH
ILLS
The amazing promptness with which
'Bisurated’ Magnesia arrests acute pain,
and its downright remedial effects in
obstinate cases of Indigestion, Gastritis
and Ulcerated Stomach will be a revela-
tion to the despairing sufferer who puts
‘Bisurated’ Magnesia to the test.
“MARVELLOUS FOR
STOMACH TROUBLES”,
says Mr. Dyson of Birming-I
ham, who writes: “ I have?:
suffered with my stomach;:;
for the last five years without;;:
relief. It was like being iiyi;
hell. I saw your
ment and sent for a bottle oif
‘Bisurated’ Magnesia. If.-:
seemed to drown the pain. i
It is marvellous for stomach
troubles. I am a dead man
come back to life as the
hardest work does not hurt
me now, thanks to* Bisurated’
Magnesia.”
m
from a recent photo
of Mr. J. Dyson
After 5 years’ torture ‘Bisurated’ Magnesia
brought this man complete and lasting
relief!
“ULCERS ALMOST DROVE ME MAD”
'•"V
from a recent photo
of Mrs. Jones
-NO PAINS NOW!
Mir. Jones of Worcester
writes“ I have been ill for
seven years with gastritis
which turned to ulcers—the
pain almost drove me mad.
I was not able to take food
of any kind. A month ago,
whilst in dreadful pain a
friend told me to try
‘ Bisurated ’ Magnesia which
I did, and I have had no pains
since—the first month with-
out pain for seven years.
Can now eat any kind ot
food with comfort.”
‘Bisurated ’ Magnesia completed her
recovery when other methods failed.
Why continue to suffer pain and misery
when you can so easily be rid of them?
When you take 'Bisurated ’ Magnesia you
are not making an experiment; you are
taking a remedy which has been banishing
stomach ills for over 20 years. Get a
bottle of ‘Bisurated* Magnesia, powder or
tablets, from any chemist and start your
recovery to-day!

to their doom, the cold air cooling them
quickly so that their red cores glowed
through a thin bluish veil.
Later she gets down to details:
The sides of the channel holding an ingot
moved in, and the live metal was pressed
as though it were toffee, made to slide back-
wards and forwards, at every forward pass
finding itself compressed and lengthened
until a seven-ton block of steel was re-
duced to a strip 15 x 150 mm. section and
35m. long.
A 7000-h.p. reversible electric motor occu-
pied an apartment alongside the blooming
mill.
This motor is capable of 15,000 h.p. at
the moment when the ingot strikes the
rollers. In two seconds it attains full
power in the opposite direction.
All Mrs. Prichard’s workers are smil-
ing and jolly.
Now, this obviously is nothing more
than rhapsody. Mrs. Prichard probably
knows no more about steel manufacture
than the average novelist. The figures
she quotes were doubtless given to her
by an overseer, and conveyed as little
to her mind as if they had been in mil-
lions instead of hundreds and thousands.
They might indicate to a skilled engineer
not efficiency but hopeless incompetence.
She solemnly puts them down in her
notebook and publishes them as showing
the triumphant march of the proletariat
towards salvation.
If this adult adoration of the Soviet
economy were a revival of the infantile
delight in mechanical toys there might
be something in it. The child who takes
a toy to pieces does so in order to learn
something, not in order to acquire leis-
ure or material benefits; and to that
extent the child is doing something artis-
tic. But the proletarian who tends some
little part of a gigantic machine in a
mass-production factory learns nothing,
and is not expected to learn anything.
Ostensibly he is trying to better himself
materially and earn the leisure which,
it is claimed, he will eventually be taught
to use artistically.
Actually, nothing of the sort can
happen, because the effects of such labor
on the mind are precisely the same
whether one is working for the prole-
tarian State or a private manufacturer.
There is little evidence to date that the
proletarian is spending his leisure more
intelligently in Russia than elsewhere,
propaganda to the contrary notwith-
standing. A person tired out by mono-
tonous and meaningless tasks does not
want to paint pictures, write poems or
compose music. He wants to be amused,
and in that direction, no doubt, the
masters of the Soviet will serve him
admirably.
But what is there in all this for an
artist like Mrs. Prichard to enthuse over?
It has no relation to the child’s artistic
interest in machinery, but nowhere does
she draw this distinction.
She seems to regard Russian mass
production as a good thing in itself in-
stead of a deplorable concomitant of a
machine age which has made it impos-
sible for a workman to make a beautiful
piece of furniture or a stonemason a
lovely building.
As far as 1 am aware, Mrs. Prichard
has never visited an Australian works —
at any rate, I have never read any men-
tion of them coming from her typewriter.
If she did she could find reversible elec-
tric motors, iron fingers clasping rose
and mauve ingots and dumb giants of
all sorts. And I am ready to swear that
if she did pay such a visit she would find
the works unbaautiful because they be-
long to bourgeois capitalists. The dumb
giants would have grinned malevolently
and the steel ingots would have scorched
the tormented faces of the slaves who
tended them.
Marx was certainly a talented econo-
mist, but as a mesmerist he is even more
effective.

A Letter
From Cecilia
I cannot tell
you how very
charmed both
myself and my
dear grand-
mother were to
read the pure and noble sentiments ex-
pressed by Mr. C. H. Rolleston on the
white part of the Red Page of September
19. There is something peculiarly fitting
in that: I mean sentiments of such white
purity being printed on the white part.
Surely the writer is Commander Rol-
leston, of the Navy, in which case it is
gratifying indeed to find one who has
not been corrupted or debased
By that foul word which crowns the
seaman’s phrase,
if I may quote poetry.
I have never had the misfortune to
read the writer whom he so justly attacks,
Liam O’Flaherty, and I certainly never
will. On the other hand, I will take the
first opportunity of reading all those nice
other Irishmen whom he mentions —
Yeats, Russell, George Moore and
Synge—and I’m not going to be put oil
by the fact that I’ve heard how George
Moore was once banned and regarded
as a most disgusting writer. I suppose
Mr. Rolleston would be able to explain
this by pointing out how we all make
mistakes sometimes, and so on. It
would be the same, wouldn’t it? with
Thomas Hardy, who, I understand, is
now considered respectable, but who, I
am told, was so upset over the treatment
of what he regarded as his major works
that he gave up writing them and took
to writing poetry and was buried in
Westminster Abbey.
I know I have heard that Liam O'Flah-
erty is a writer who portrays life as he
has had the misfortune to see it in his
immediate surroundings, and that Ire-
land is not a place bathed in the efful-
gence of perpetual twilight and popu-
lated by leprechauns, and if so it is a
pity. But what really impelled me to
write this letter is the pregnant (if that
word is quite all right) last sentence in
Mr. Rolleston’s article, where he says
with such impressive finality: “If this is
art then practically all the most sublime
poets and story-tellers of past ages were
impostors.”
Those are wonderfully true sentiments,
and they make me think of all the illus-
trious dead., such as Herrick and Swift
and Donne (all clergymen, too!) and
Smollett and Shakspeare and Balzac and
Fielding and Chaucer and Suckling—
and, oh ! I could go on for pages naming
these most sublime poets and story-tellers
of past ages who never contaminated a
page with an obscene word or any
wicked naughtiness whatever. Thank
you,

Nudism,
Plain and
Fancy.
Anatole France
says Pinel be-
lieved that a fine
case of typhoid
was the most
beautiful thing on
earth. The choice seems rather special-
ised, though worse objects have been
admired at art exhibitions. The newest
important fact to challenge the general
idea of art is nudism, plain and fancy.
Current expressions of the cult are
fundamentally of the two kinds, corporal
and literary. The former is the cruder
and less interesting, both in ease of ac-
complishment and in effect. Barring
cripples and babies, anybody who wears
clothes can take them off. Literary nud-
ism is more difficult, but is capable of
being more subtly shocking.
There is, among writers, self-revelation
by intention and by necessary conse-
quence. Some try mightily, with indif-
ferent results, while others discard their
mental garments almost unconsciously.
The result may be gratifying to the public
or just an unlovely indiscretion, depend-
ing upon the type of mind projected. But
usually the effect is only partial. Most
of us would shrink less from baring our
bodies than our minds, since the popu-
larity of daily-newspaper reports of vio-
lence indicates in one particular that
about 30 per cent, of us are robbers and
murderers wasted by circumstance. (An-
other 10 per cent, of us would be mil-
lionaire philanthropists like Carnegie if
we were millionaires, but that is not what
the police force is kept for.)
Arnold Bennett entertained us clad
mentally in a cigar and suspenders; we
recognise Wells in a chaste but sufficient
bathrobe ; Chesterton in cap and bells,
juggling with a couple of greased fal-
lacies ; Mencken in skin tights, and Gals-
worthy in three suits of blue serge.
Arlen and a few others have rigged up
naked effigies, hopefully tagged them
“This is I,” and paraded them before the
“popular” reading public—the while
they snigger- at the trick from behind a
neighboring bush. This venial class is
legion.
But there is a more important group,
the recrudescence of which during the
last few years seems to give special signi-
ficance to the rash of nudist colonies that
has broken out abroad. The breed has
had an excrescent vogue overseas, par-
ticularly in leading popular periodicals in
the U.S. Macaulay dubbed them liter-
ary beggars, crying an alms for the sores
and deformities in their minds. Incap-
able of making an agreeable subject of
their minds, they set out to startle and
disgust with fake candor. Any sort of
paying notoriety is grist to their mill.
“Why I Hate My Child” is a sample of
the flypaper captions on this muck, but
usually the theme is biliously erotic.
Curiously, many of the hogs laboring in
this offal are women.
The lot of them attract readers for just
the same reason that a crowd gathers and
gawps at a street accident.
The snag for both branches of the
nudist cult is the sense of pudency, pro-
bably not native, that is in all of us ex-
cept very young children and animals
and those with child-like or animal minds
—understanding child-like to cover the
magnificent amorality that moved Shak-
speare, Boccaccio and Rabelais alike,
making w'holesome (to all but the cen-
sors) what is ordinarily obscene.
Shaw is a true nude, though even he
seems at times to be a masked and ochre-
bedaubed witch doctor, believing in no-
thing but himself. George Bernard
Adonis is one of the few; the only
healthy reservation in his stuff is a pass-
age on the Posterity express. The Cali-
bans are packing their luggage for no-
thing more than a tuppenny tram ride.

WATCHING THE MILKING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
/.
In the ashen evening a bird’s song spouts in silver
That swirls to the shed where an engine spits and
chugs.
The yard is muddy ; sun\ to the knees, the cows
Await the sucking cups, the hand that tugs,
Content and chewing ; and not afraid of man
Or the weird machine that robs their swollen dugs.
11.
As torchlight stabs a pool and splits the stillness,
The madness of motherhood tore these gentle eyes ;
And the fawn cows that stand so quietly in the yard
Felt ancient tides of passion in them rise,
And knew great tenderness, were wild and savage,
And. bawled in torment to the lost calf’s cries.
111.
"They soon forget . . . This happens every year.”
The light fades, and the thrush no longer sings.
‘‘And every year, and every year, and always.”
A match glows. The odor of warm mil\ brings
Remembrance of hay, and wood-smoke, and horses;
and then
Of pine-trees, and scented hair, and magical things.
IV.
The hills grow dark, are monstrous upon the earth —
Where leads the trail beyond their sprawling
weight ?
Day is a broken dream, and night fantastic;
Ghost in a ghostly world, alone and late,
I might have been watching the cold craters of the
moon
Or Pithecanthrope gesturing to his mate.

A REAL GOLD RAMP.
A report from Capetown says that “the
South African wool market is in the
doldrums.” There is no competition,
and sales have had to be abandoned. It
is hoped, however, that the position will
improve, for the Union Government is
arranging to grant “credit facilities” to
Germany. It can well afford to do so,
and if the wool-growers need help in
other directions it will be able to extend
that too.
In the first year of the depression the
position in South Africa was as bad as
it was in most other countries. Gold, for
which our Mr. Lang has so terrific a
contempt, has magically changed it for
the better —production at a greatly in-
creased sterling price of which the Gov-
ernment is taking its share.
Writing to The Bulletin from Pre-
toria, a banker (that other aversion of
Mr. Lang’s) declares that “South Africa
is without doubt the most prosperous
country on earth to-day.”
Many people who not long ago didn’t
have a bob to their name are now oozing
wealth. Fortunes of £300,000, £400,000,
even £500,000 are being made by the score,
and more modest fortunes by the thou-
sand.
At this moment there is probably more
building construction in progress at
Johannesburg than in any other city in the
world. Shops, flats, office blocks and large
public structures are going up with almost
incredible speed in almost every street.
Private buildings alone to the value of
£7,000,000 are being erected; plans for
more, to cost another £3,000,000 or
£4,000,000, have been passed by the muni-
cipality. The Government, for its part, is
to spend £10,000,000 to £15,000,000 on
buildings and the like. There is not an
unemployed carpenter, plumber, bricklayer
or electrician in the country.
As for the industry which is effecting
this transformation:
During the past 18 months close on
100 new mines have been floated. Allow-
ing for capital appreciation since S. Africa
quitted the gold standard, the total amount
invested in Rand mines is well over
£250,000,000; but, seeing that £80,000,000
worth of gold is being won annually, this
is by no means excessive. The market
value of a number of leading mines ex-
ceeds £10,000,000. Ore going 3.Bdwt. to
the ton can now be mined profitably. A
lot of it has to be hoisted from depths of
5000 ft. and 6000 ft.; several mines are hoist-
ing only slightly richer rock from 8000 ft.
Capital for the new ventures is com-
ing from Britain, the Continent and the
U.S.A. To the writer it is “surprising
that none of the big Australian mining
houses has thought it advisable to invest
in Rand shows.” He appears to con-
sider it a reflection on “Australian enter-
prise,” though he acknowledges that evi-
dence of Australian enterprise is not
lacking altogether ; “the new post office
is being built by an Australian firm of
contractors entirely with Australian
labor.” The fact is that our mining inves-
tors and speculators have better oppor-
tunities in their own country, and are
taking advantage of them. What is going
on in Johannesburg is being repeated on
a small, though growing, scale in Kal-
goorlie and other Westralian gold-mining
centres, and in Queensland and Victoria.
Though labor costs are higher at Kal-
goorlie than on the Rand, 4dwt. ore is
being treated at a profit, and other con-
ditions are more attractive, especially to
small fry.
Before the boom began, the Westralian
Department of Mines had hundreds of
abandoned leases on its books. Many
had been surrendered because, with gold
at £4 4s. lid. a fine ounce (it is now
round about £8 14s. Australian), Bdwt. or
JOdwt. ore, though plenty was available,
could not be worked profitably. Practi-
cally all could be taken up by anyone
capable of paying the arrears of rent.
With the coming of the gold bounty in
1930, a demand for these leases set in,
and when gold weat to a premium it in-
creased to a rush, while country in the
neighborhood of all mines with any repu-
tation was snapped up. Many of the new
lessees have struck it lucky—in the
market rather than on the mine. Scores
of new companies have been floated in-
expensively with great profit to the pro-
moters.
Meanwhile, of course, there has been
a great increase in gold production, with
a corresponding jump in share prices.
For example, Wilunas, quoted at 13s. or
14s. not so long ago, are now 87s. or
88s., and hard to get. Wiluna’s August
profit was reckoned at £55,000 Austra-
lian, and only once this year has its
monthly profit fallen below £50,000. On
a capital of £560,000, Lake View and
Star is also showing mine profits exceed-
ing £50,000 Australian a month. And
Great Boulder, Perseverance, North Kal-
gurli. South Kalgurli and Sons of
Gwalia are paying dividends on the 1900
scale.
Our Governments, Commonwealth
and State, are getting very little revenue
from these amazingly prosperous con-
cerns, and still less from speculators who
are making easy money hand over fist.
They ought to be getting a great deal
more, and South Africa has shown them
how. The matter-of-fact Afrikanders
have laid it down that the gold premium
is not the creation of the industry, but an
effect of depreciation of paper currency,
and that the community is entitled to a
substantial share. Their Government is
taking about half of it by means of
an excess profits tax; hence its ability to
extend “credit facilities” to German
woolbuyers and pay off its war debt to
Britain —an operation which was arranged
the other day. Hence also the surplus
of £6,410,000 which the Minister of
Finance reported last April and conces-
sions which the Government has granted
since.
Restoration of the penny post to all parts
of the British Commonwealth; reduction
of the stamp duty on cheques from 2d. to
Id.; increase of the income-tax exemption
from £3OO to £400; a 20 p.c. rebate in
respect of normal income-tax payments;
cancellation of all forms of farm tax and
quit rent.
It is enough to make an Australian
mouth water. And the wherewithal has
been obtained without hurting legitimate
enterprise or industry: Mr. Havenga, the
Finance Minister, points out that in 1933
Rand dividends increased 48 p.c. to
£12,400,000. For 1934-35 the excess-
profits tax is expected to yield £7,400,000.
Australia, of course, is not taxing the
premium. Its politicians, though ruthless
where Australian woolgrowers are con-
cerned, have a kindness for English gold-
mining companies. The Commonwealth
taxes their dividends Is. in the £. West-
ralian State taxes are Is. 3d. in the £,
plus 15 p.c. super-tax, I|d. in the £ for
hospitals and 9d. in the £ “emergency”
tax. The Westralian Government gets a
special grant of £600,000 p.a. from the
Commonwealth —in addition to £473,000
for State interest and sinking fund and a
substantial share of the Federal-aid road-
money, £2,000,000 p.a. —and is always
whining that it isn’t enough. Its leader
recently travelled to a conference of
Premiers and reported that his deficit for
1933-34 would be nearly £BOO,OOO. With
the Commonwealth surplus deducted the
Australian Governments went another
£5,700,000 to the bad last year—at least,
that was their own estimate ; the new
Tas. Government swears that its predeces-
sor’s deficit was understated by quarter
of a million or so, and mainland
Auditors-General are beginning to sug-
gest that a great deal of unreproductive
expenditure was charged to loan accounts.
From its tax on all company dividends,
Westralia gets little more than a quarter’s
mine profits of Wiluna or Lake View
and Star.
Much has been heard about “gold
ramps.” This is the real gold ramp:
that from companies which are making
so much —and so much more than they
are earning—Governments should be
taking so little.
FELLOW-MEMBER RUSSIA.
The League which Uncle Sam aban-
doned on the world’s doorstep 15 years
ago has perpetrated its cardinal piece of
folly in admitting Soviet Russia.
Admission means, among other things,
that Australia is bound, under two
articles of the Covenant, “to respect” and
help “to preserve the integrity and inde-
pendence” of the vast Russian territories
in Europe and Asia, and, should Japan
go to war with Russia while still nomin-
ally a member, “sever all trade and finan-
cial relations” with and discuss war
measures against the Japanese —a nation
which, in its relations with Australia, has
always played the game. It is a
negation of all sanity and a final reason
why the British Commonwealth of
Nations should withdraw from the chat-
tering Geneva convention and put to
better use the money its members ex-
pend on the thing.
Had the personnel of the Russian Gov-
ernment changed appreciably it might be
different. Except that Lenin is dead and
Trotsky is in exile, it has not changed
at all. Litvinoff, who has been posing
for the last few months as the dove
among Foreign Secretaries, is the same
old Litvinoff who was Lenin’s chief
financial adviser when every foreign
obligation was repudiated in 1918 and
every British and every American citi-
zen with property in Russia was
robbed of it. Stalin, head of the
U.S.S.R. and the Communist Inter-
national, is the same ruthless organ-
iser who was Lenin’s chief terrorist
agent in the early days of the repub-
lics. Molotov, the President, only a
year ago wrote that “on the eve of the
15th year of the October revolution
the victory of world Bolshevism is grow-
ing nearer with giant strides,” and burst
into pasans of praise for “our glorious
Red Army”:
Having in mind the possibility of military
intervention by our relentless enemies in
the imperialist camp, we declare, with un-
shaken faith in our strength and the
strength of our class friends, that the Soviet
Union is invincible.
This year Russian papers, including
those printed in English, have been full
of the Red Republic’s struggle for peace.
The official “Moscow News” paints the
world outside the U.S.S.R. borders as
a “powder magazine,” with all the
nations “ready to hurl themselves at
each other’s throats and drive millions to
world-wide slaughter.” It prints in large
type 12 steps which it says the U.S.S.R.
has made for disarmament. Neither it
nor M. Litvinoff, however, quotes the in-
struction of the 13th Plenum of the Com-
munist party in January (at which Litvin-
off himself was present) to “all sections
of the Communist party in all coun-
tries” :
Exert every effort, without losing a
moment for the revolutionary preparation
of the proletariat for the impending de-
cisive battles for power.
Voroshiloff, Commissar for War —his
official title —told the same gathering
that his country has a “fully-up-to-date,
good, strong army ready for battle,
and can justly pride itself on its arma-
ments,” including a “mighty force of
heavy bombers”; but the Moscow
“News” made no reference to that.
Neither did it mention that, while a flood
of propaganda is being released in Aus-
tralia urging the Australian workman to
keep this country defenceless, the Mos-
cow Government has more than doubled
its 1931 expenditure on its army, air
force and navy.
The Russian army was reorganised in
1925. The U.S.S.R. has that conscrip-
tion which its agents incessantly urge
Australians to oppose. According to
official figures, it has an active army of
562,000 —four times the strength of the
British standing army—and altogether
1,200,000 men (and women) are called
up annually for training. M. Voroshiloff
is proud that his is the “most highly
mechanised force in the world—7.4
h.p. per head,” while “50 p.c. of Red
Army officers are technicians.”
It was reserved for small democratic
nations whose zeal for peace has never
been questioned to object to the admis-
sion of the country that has tried to stir
up civil war everywhere. Switzerland,
which knew Lenin as a citizen for some
time before the Russian Revolution, and
whose legation at Petrograd was pillaged
in 1918, an official being murdered, took
the lead. Belgium supported it, and so
did Holland. And Mr. de Valera ques-
tioned whether a country whose doctrine
is that “religion is the opium of the
people” is likely to act in a Christian
spirit.
Australia has sunk over a half-
million of money in sending delegates to
the League and keeping up its palaces.
It seems sheer madness to go on
spending at this rate for joint action
with and protection of a Power
whose emissaries in Australia told us
in their 1931 programme, officially
approved in Moscow, that they aspire to
“expel all Governors, withdraw from the
British Empire and establish in Australia
a workers’ and farmers’ republic with
a soviet form of government, in firm
political and economic alliance with the
U.S.S.R.”
Judging by Stalin’s pronouncement at
the 17th Congress of his party this
year that Russia can “rely on her
glorious army,” and that “those who
attack our country will receive a stun-
ning rebuff to teach them not to poke
their pig’s snout into our Soviet garden
again,” Russia has nothing to fear in
isolation. Certainly the rest of the world
has nothing to gain from the intrusion of
this overarmed, interfering, abusive
Power into the realm of “peace-making.”
THE ABORIGINAL PROBLEM.
[The Professor of Anthropology at Sydney
University replies to a Bulletin article.]
The writer of “Settling Binghi’s Case”
(B. 19/9/’34) must surely be basing his
remarks on some very brief newspaper
report of a speech. Had he read any of
the articles on the problem written by
me during the past few years, or had he
listened to any of my addresses, he would
not have shown such misunderstanding
of my views nor of the problem.
We must face the facts squarely, free
from all emotional bias. To say that
my reported statement that “the abori-
gines have declined by 240,000 since
white occupation” is “pure guesswork”
may be plain English, but it is neither
courteous nor correct. A very careful
estimate of the aboriginal population in
1788 was made a few years ago, based
on all available sources ; the details were
published in the Commonwealth Year-
Book, 1930. The number of 300,000 is
an under- rather than an over-estimate
for a continent of the size of Australia,
in spite of its desert areas, especially
when we remember the aborigines’ power
of wresting a livelihood from it, to which
your writer refers. The present full-
blood population is about 60,000.
Your writer correctly thinks that “the
only remnants likely to survive intact
are those in the districts of the North
where white settlement has scarcely pene-
trated.” But that inevitably means that
none will “survive intact.” Settlers, dog-
gers, buffalo-hunters, missionaries,
miners, police have hardly left one tribal
area untouched, however remote it be.
Moreover, the natives in such parts are
constantly visiting the nearest white
settlements, and in due time remain in
close touch with these so as to enjoy
the white man’s “blessings.” All this
is now happening at an increasing rate
in Cape York Peninsula, Arnhem Land,
West-Central Australia and the North-
ern Kimberley. It is therefore meaning-
less to attribute to me the suggestion
that untouched aborigines should be
brought “to civilisation via a transition
period under white-man supervision.”
The theme of all my speeches and
articles is, that in the Northern Territory
and North-west Australia we are con-
fronted with a condition of contact and
clash of two races, one of which, the
original owner, is primitive and the
Other, the invading race, is civilised.
Further, we are not only concerned with
the advancement of the aborigines, as
far as that is possible, but also with find-
ing a worthy solution of the problem of
the clash of the two peoples. The inci-
dents of the last few years alone should
make all good citizens anxious to put an
end to the constant conflict in the north-
ern parts of the continent, especially as
our own folk must very often directly,
and more often indirectly, bear the re-
sponsibility for the conflict. My sugges-
tions are that the Administrator of the
North should be chosen for his knowledge
of conditions of racial and cultural clash,
and that he should be assisted by depart-
ments of Native Affairs and Native
Justice, including patrolling magistrates.
The remnant of the natives in direct
contact with us may be “beyond saving,”
but that does not mean that we should
sit back and callously let them die out
without making an attempt to work out
a positive policy for their salvation as
a people. Repetition of the baseless
opinion that the “intact tribes can save
themselves if left alone” is simply not
true ; that is, it is not true since we have
settled in the continent. As I have
already mentioned, such tribes, apart
from any visitation on the part of whites,
are themselves visiting and gradually
shifting towards white settlements, and
no physical power will prevent them
from doing so, any more than it will pre-
vent doggers, miners and others from
going to the natives’ territory if there be
any possibility of gain or adventure. The
only hope is to establish in each reserve
an institution or station of some kind
where the natives can find the best at-
tractions which they associate with white
settlements, and where they could find,
or be taught to find, new interests in
cattle work, gardening, industrial and
other activities.
Anthropologists do not interfere with
tribal customs, etc., but study their mean-
ing and social function, so as to be able
to explain to the authorities what is, or
will be, the result of the various forms
of interference that are actually operat-
ing or are contemplated. They can,
moreover, make suggestions for the
framing of policies. And they can do
this because their conclusions and views
are not based on hasty, superficial in-
vestigations, as is too often said, but on
careful researches which have been con-
ducted according to a well-planned
scheme during the past six years, quite
apart from the earlier work of Spencer,
Howitt, Roth and others.
A. P. ELKIN.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
The People Chose Well.
Although some painfully ordinary poli-
ticians will go back to Canberra and
better men lost their seats —for example,
Fenton and Hutchin on the U.A.P. side
and Jack Barnes, Scullin-Labor’s leader
in the Senate —thd results of the Com-
monwealth elections, so tardily arrived
at, generally reflect the good sense of the
Australian people. On its record, none
of the four parties deserved a majority
in the House of Representatives and
none got one. All have, in a sense, been
rebuked.
Six seats have been taken from the
U.A.P., which claimed far more credit
for its performances than it deserved.
Two were lost by the Country party, but
it will gain one by the accession of the
new Cameron from Barker. In effect,
these parties have been bluntly told to
stop their ridiculous wrangling and get
on with the job of responsible govern-
ment, each being necessary to the other.
The mandate of the minority that voted
Labor is also for the cessation of the
idiotic faction fighting which has now
raged for nearly four years. For the
rest, both Labor groups, while permitted
to regain a little lost ground in the
House of Representatives, have been
sharply reminded that the country won’t
stand any monkeying with its savings or
its currency. As a safeguard against the
advent of a Labor Government with its
head full of windy nonsense, Lang-
Labor has been cast out of 'the Senate
and Scullin-Labor has been reduced to
insignificance there.
One striking feature of the elections
was the snub administered in Westralia
to State Labor, which has been truckling
to the secessionists, and to secessionist
candidates, three of whom lost their de-
posits. Another was the series of blows
delivered to the pre-selection swindle. In
Tasmania, four Labor candidates were
endorsed against Hutchin in Denison and
two against Minister Guy in Bass. No
such Labor victories were won in any
other State, and it will be remark-
able if Labor supporters remain satisfied
with a system which has so many un-
savory aspects, besides narrowing their
choice. In Queensland there was ob-
viously a revolt against the Senate ticket
imposed on the party by the bosses at'
Brisbane.
The Nationalists, for their part, have
reason to be thankful that the un-
endorsed Edmunds stood for Ballarat as
well as the candidate with the party
brand, who won on Edmunds’s prefer-
ences, and that there were Country-party
preferences to draw on in electorates like
Indi, Wannon and Robertson. The
Country party should be equally grate-
ful for the U.A.P. preferences in Calare
and New England.
A branch of the C.P. organisation in
Victoria is already out with the pro-
posal that the Agrarians drop pre-selec-
tion once and for all. Australia would
get a better class of member and more
sporting elections if all the parties
dropped it.

A Lyons-Page Government?
Mr. Lyons has invited the Country party
to join with the U.A.P. in governing the
Commonwealth, with two Cabinet Minis-
ters and an honorary. The numbers
(U.A.P. 32, C.P. 15) are much the same
as when Nationalists and Agrarians com-
bined at the beginning of 1933, ex-
cept that the U.A.P. has no followers as
such in Queensland or South Aus. South
Australia’s Liberal and Country League,
which has been eminently successful at
two Commonwealth elections, says it is
“not tied to any Canberra caucus” and
its members are free to sit where they
like. Still the Prime Minister has made
a fair offer, and it should be fairly met.
The party leaders arranged to discuss
the position at Melbourne yesterday.
Australia will expect them to arrive at
an agreement and give it a Government
that will last till the fourteenth Parlia-
ment has run its full course. It is in no
mood to listen to Mr. Lane, of Barton
(U.A.P.), who thinks that the C.P. should
efface itself and meekly support a U.A.P.
Government, or to Mr. Thompson, of
New England (C.P.), who demands “half
the portfolios” for his group and “will in
no circumstances support a U.A.P, or
composite Government that does not
provide reasonable protection for the
tobacco industry.” Australia needs a
Government that will hold the scales
equitably between country and city, farm
and factory, and extend the benefits of
the national fiscal policy to all worth-
while industries. It is not out of the
wood yet, so it requires the strongest
Government it can get.
Mr. Stevens Means Well.
Returned-soldier preference, as N. S.
Wales knows it, was given an airing in
several places last week —it never gets
much more.
The Mayor of Mascot introduced the
subject at a Local Government Associa-
tion conference at Goulburn. His coun-
cil, as he confessed, had recently to
choose between a returned-soldier appli-
cant for a job and an immigrant with no
war record, and he has the grace to be
ashamed of its decision —“the man with
the preference clause in his favor was
not selected, although he had the quali-
fications.” Mayor Dransfield moved for
“the repeal of section 95, clause 3, of
the Local Government Act, in order that
the Returned Soldiers Act 1919 might
apply.”
The effect of repealing the clause would
be that councils would be directed to give
preference to Diggers; the 1919 Act would
then automatically operate. At present
that measure conflicts with the Local Gov-
ernment Act.
The motion was lost; 50 voted for it and
75 against.
The subject came up again at the
R.S.S.I.L.A. conference on motion that
the pertinent clauses in the two
measures mentioned be put in a work-
able condition and enforced. Delegates
said they were sick of being fobbed off
with hollow promises. One quoted a
case in which a council, supposed to be
bound to give preference, had put the
names of applicants for a job into a
hat. Others related experiences of the
same kind.
A diversion was created by the reading
of a letter from Premier Stevens to the
effect that legislation to enforce prefer-
ence would be introduced this session.
Some cheered the announcement; others
shouted “More promises!” A vice-presi-
dent' explained that, although the League
had had many assurances which had
proved worthless, this was the first time
it had received one in writing.
That very day the State Parliament,
both Houses of which are under U.A.P.
control, had to elect a member for a
vacancy in the Leg. Council. There were
seven candidates, among whom was an
A.LF. man and one of the greatest
of them —Charles Rosenthal, who was
also M.L.A. for Bathurst (1922-1925).
But it is a long time since Bean saw
“commanders like Rosenthal at Gallipoli
perpetually walking about the skyline by
their gun positions, with bullets aimed at
them every time,” and it’s a long way to
Lagnicourt and Mont St. Quentin. There
were 140 members present, and Rosen-
thal got three votes. He was the first
candidate to go out. Mr. H. W. Whid-
don got 60 votes, and was elected on the
fourth count with 80. Not Mr. Whiddon
of the lottery joint, as might be sup-
posed, but, according to “S. M. Herald’s”
account of him, “a prominent member
of the U.A.P., well known in commercial
circles,” to whom Mr. Stevens owes
much:
For many years Mr. Whiddon has taken
an active interest in both Federal and State
politics, particularly in the western sub-
urbs of Sydney, where he is president of
the Parkes (Federal) and Croydon (State)
U.A.P. electoral conferences. He is chair-
man of the council which controls the
Croydon electorate, represented by the
Premier. !
Mr. Stevens means well, but don’t
expect much of him, Digger! Not too
much, anyway. '

Providence and Stuart Doyle.
Several months ago Mr. Stuart Doyle,
of Sydney, discovered that a great wrong
was contemplated. Rivals proposed to
compete with him in the movie business
by building other theatres —or at least
one other theatre. Mr. Doyle felt that an-
other theatre “could not help but spell
ruin to the shareholders” in his con-
cerns, which have “a quasi-monopoly of
first-release theatres.” Deeply impressed,
the State Government immediately ap-
pointed a Royal Commission.
Mr. Marks, the gentleman to whom
the Royal Commission was issued, heard
voluminous evidence. One group of
witnesses acknowledged that they
proposed to erect a theatre for movies
and stage productions, together with a
garage, a shopping arcade and a block
of 90 flats. One gentleman said that the
Australian independent producer was “in'
the grip of Mr. Doyle,” and therefore
in a “precarious position.” Mr. Marks’s
judgment was emphatic, if ponderously
phrased;
If legislation were introduced restricting
the licensing of theatres and having for its
object the protection of existing picture
exhibiting interests, 1 am of opinion that
there would be no end to the number of
industries which might claim Governmental •
protection by legislation on grounds as
good as those advanced by the film
interests... .1 consider the producer of
motion pictures has an unquestionable right
to exhibit his own product if he so elects.
So the promoter went ahead with his
project. He employed a representative
architect, C. Bruce Dellit, who won the
prize for the design of the N. S. Wales
Anzac Memorial and built the 10-storey
Kyle House and other Sydney buildings,
none of which has fallen down. But
when Mr. Dellit’s plans were submitted
to the Chief Secretary’s Department they
were rejected on the ground that they
did not comply with the minimum re-
quirements of the Board of Fire Com-
missioners.
The architect pointed out that the
“objections raised to my plans in respect
to sunken courts and covered ways were
not persisted in by the Chief Secretary
in respect of the last two theatres erected
in Sydney.” Mr. Chaffey, the Chief
Secretary, says that other theatres gave
better protection to the public.
Three independent experts have re-
ported on the rejected plans. Professor
Wilkinson, president of the Institute of
Architects and Dean of the Sydney Uni-
versity Faculty of Architecture, found
that they complied with the spirit of the
Theatres and Public Halls Act. The
exits would “adequately safeguard public
safety”:
Similar latitude should be allowed to this
building as to other theatres recently
erected, especially as it would be con-
structed of fireproof materials.
To Professor Hook, head of the Uni-
versity Building and Construction De-
partment, it seemed “incredible” that
objection should be taken to some of
the features.
It is hard to believe that with work so
badly needed a cool £250,000-worth can
be withheld from the community on such
grounds.
The lecturer-in-charge of the Technical
College architectural school commended
the plans.
But, having “carefully studied” the
reports of his officials, Mr. Chaffey con-
curs with them. If the architect doesn’t
like it, he can go to court. The plans are
“definitely rejected.”
Providence works in a mysterious way,
but it seems to be a consistent friend of
Mr. Stuart Doyle.
♦
In the Centenary’s Name.
Frank Clarke, President of the Vic. Leg.
Council, and Everard, Speaker of the
Assembly, cast a joint spanner into the
Centenary Council works by protesting
against the erection of the Venetian poles
in front of their Spring-street shop. They
declared it an affront to the dignity, if
not of the legislators, at least of the
building—really a beautiful piece of
architecture.
But there are worse things being done
elsewhere. The pylons on Prince’s Bridge
are a gimcrack and hastily-conceived at-
tempt to give impressiveness to the en-
trance to the city. And the Town Hall
has broken out in boils to the number
of several hundred, the idea being to
floodlight the building.
Perhaps the idea is that the visitor will
be so lost in admiration of these addi-
tions to Melbourne that he will forget
to grumble at being denied a glass of
Australian wine or ale with his evening
meal (the hotels must shut at 6 p.m., as
usual) and at having to pay Is. 6d. flag-
fall and Is. 6d. a mile for a taxi-ride.
'
Three Dull Budgets.
Three embarrassed State Treasurers
weighed in with their Budgets last week.
They all anticipate increased expenditure
and recurring deficits, and in no case are
the taxpayers to get any relief.
In N. S. Wales £2,910,000 is to be
added to the £24,900,000 of accumulated
deficiencies now debited against the
Treasury for the years 1929-34. Mr.
Stevens proposes to spend £45,777,000 —
£540,000 more than last year. “As
finances further improve,” he will con-
sider the restoration of- public-service
pay-cuts and further reduction of taxa-
tion. It seems a safe sort of promise,
having regard to the price of wool, but a
general election is due next year. The
N. S. Wales national debt is now
£322,000,000. It was £234,000,000 in
June, 1927.
Mr. Stevens’s summary of his last
year’s performance differs remarkably
from the Auditor-General’s review of it.
The A.-G. says the deficit was
£3,779,000 ; Mr. Stevens says it was
£3,208,391. The A.-G. Reckons collec-
tions at £623,000 more than Mr. Stevens’s
estimate; they agree only on the
amount received from the Common-
wealth. These discrepancies have been
commented on in previous years by
As.-G. Mr. Spence regards “emergency
measures which entail large expenditures
from boiTowed money on which interest
is paid by further borrowing” as “no
more than a stopgap.”
But all State Treasurers are keen on
such “emergency measures.” Mr. Forgan
Smith is leaning heavily on them ; for
the rest, his Government is to spend from
revenue £15,349,000 (£352,000 more than
last year) and collect £14,348,000
(£488,000 more than 1933-34). Last year,
despite Commonwealth assistance, the
Government which, with Queensland’s
many advantages, ought to be making the
best showing owned to a revenue deficit
of £1,128,000. In all, the State debt in-
creased £3,286,497 during the year; it
has swollen £5,906,000 since June, 1932.
It will swell some more during next year.
The net addition during the Govern-
ment’s term of office will be about
£7,500,000.
The community is not enthusiastic.
“High taxation is stifling business,” says
the chairman of the Brisbane Chamber
of Commerce.
The Butler Government has budgeted
for a deficit of £517,000. Without the
special Commonwealth grant, it would
be nearly £2,000,000. Here again there
is to be no reduction in taxation. Ex-
penditure will increase £40,000, and the
Premier is going to ask the Common-
wealth to finance a scheme for .settling
unemployed.
All three Budgets are dull and uncon-
structive —mere flounderings. Not that
the State Treasurers are altogether to
blame. They have too much expendi-
ture to meet with the sources of revenue
left to them. Obviously there will have
to be a redistribution of functions, with
the Commonwealth taking over depart-
ments that the States have ceased to be
able to handle —education, for example.

Recommended to Mercy.
The murder rate is rising in Australia,
but the conviction rate is falling. Juries
seem strangely reluctant to convict in
murder cases, and when they do convict
they generally bespeak mercy for the
merciless.
Take the case of Mr. John Hope Boles.
A Victorian rabbit-trapper, with a wife
and four children, Mr. Boles formed an
attachment to a 24-year-old girl named
Dorman, whom he visited “almost every
night,” leaving his wife at home in
Prahran. The girl, according to medical
evidence, remained virtuous.
One night in July, 1933, screams were
heard from her room. Mr. Boles was dis-
covered on the bed hitting her with a
loaded hosepipe. When the landlady
rushed in, she was also hit. Her son-in-
law took her away and, returning, saw
Boles leaving the room with an open
razor in his hand. Razor cuts and hose-
pipe blows caused the girl’s death.
Next day, Boles visited a friend and
said he had been in a brawl and the
patrol was after him. He spent the even-
ing with another girl, to whom he re-
peated that the police were after him,
adding that it would “mean seven years”
for him. The young woman advised him
to give himself up:
Boles had wit enough to escape to
the country, get a job and secrete
himself for 12 months before he was
arrested. He told the police that he
wouldn’t call his assault on Miss Dorman
“an attack,” but accused her of attack-
ing him “when he went to get out of
the room.” He denied having had a
razor. The landlady said that Boles
had been introduced as the girl’s fiance,
and she was told that the pair were to
be married shortly.
When she saw Boles on the night of the
attack he seemed cool and deliberate.
The defence was a plea of insanity.
But Boles was sane enough to make a
statement from the dock in which he
asserted that he was under great strain at
the time of the murder and that, having
lost his employment, he “could think of
nothing else but suicide.” His relations
with Miss Dorman were most innocent.
He called on her to say good-bye before
taking his life, but he could remember
nothing of the events immediately before
and after the murder —this despite his
statement to the police that Miss Dor-
man had attacked him. It was not
till after he had left the house that he
“felt he had done something terrible.”
The jury found him guilty, with
“a strong recommendation to mercy on
account of his previous good character
and the great mental strain he was under
at the time of the murder.”
Mercy for a ruffian who destroyed a
young woman in a brutal and deliberate
manner without provocation! Such ver-
dicts are endangering the very existence
of the jury system.


Society
"AND ITS WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Jack High”: Election shocks? When
a brand-new Cadillac purred up to the
polling-booth to erupt a well-tailored
gentleman of impressive frontage, I
proffered a U.A.P. card with cheery
optimism ; my Labor vis-a-vis tendered
his as a matter of form. The recipient
included the pair of us in an impartial
glare of sullen ferocity. “To hell with
you both,” he spat out as he shouldered
past. “I’m Communist!”
“Chevroford”: What doesn’t seem to
have been observed in connection with
the birthday illumination of Melbourne
is that private enterprise has already
done the trick so effectively that more
electrified gaiety is superfluous. In most
“If you don’t stop nagging, Martha, you’ll rouse the devil in me!”
of the principal thoroughfares the festive
array of Neon lights is so tremendous
that municipal efforts are niggling by
comparison. Most of the signs are sta-
tionary, but a few are beginning to wink
and blink, and lately the public has been
entertained by a shower of disappearing
flowers of various hues in Bourke-street
that will stimulate rival shopmen. The
most striking display of the kind I have
ever seen was a cigarette advertisement
which staggered the natives of Shanghai
25 years ago. A gigantic Chinaman
periodically lifted a fag to his mouth and
discharged a cloud of smoke, when the
whole apparition vanished. As Shanghai
is as flat as the Nullarbor Plain the sign
was visible for 50 miles around. But one
night a shell from one of the opposing
armies in the perennial civil war which
was going on in the vicinity passed
through the structure. When the effigy
reappeared it was seen that the gunner,
either by luck or good marksmanship,
had not only demolished a house in the
background, but removed the ash from
the gasper. The authorities spoilt his
sport by decreeing lights out until the
rival militarists declared an armistice.
* * * *
“J.G.”: The main reason given for
installing automatic traffic lights in Mel-
bourne streets was that police would not
be needed at intersections. The lights
have now been on for a few
years; yet, instead of one
traffic cop at each intersec-
tion, there are now two or ,
more at each corner to see
that the traffic does not try
to beat the lights. When the
single John was on the job
the traffic stopped dead when
he held his arm up; now it tries its
hardest to beat the signals. Trams
are as bad as motors in this respect;
foot-passengers are even worse.
* * =!•- *
“Findy”: I have become accustomed
to undertakers who style themselves
“morticians” and refer to coffins as
“caskets” and burials as “interments.”
I am surprised no longer when the
suburban ham and beef shop becomes a
“delicatessen.” But I bucked when I dis-
covered that our fruiterer, scorning the
honorable name of greengrocer, had
caused to be emblazoned across his
window the title “fruitologist.” Before
long, I suppose, the baker will become a
“panarologist,” or whatever is the
pseudo-classical word for his ancient
calling.
“Groper”: Where and when was the
first aeroplane constructed and flown in
Australia? At Kalgoorlie over 20 years
ago; there, early in 1914, a thoroughly
airworthy machine was built and flown
by a group of apprentice engineers, the
only imported piece being the engine.
This bars all claims to having been the
first to fly in an imported machine ; like-
wise all claims for machines that were
built and might have been flown but
weren’t.
* * * *
“Lord Luvus”: Provided the immigra-
tion authorities do not adopt a wowser
attitude, the centenary celebrations will
be brightened by the attendance of four
Indian visitors. One is reported to be
in the habit of suspending himself up-
side down during the daytime, like the
Queensland flying-fox ; another has held
his hand up so long that he cannot take
it down again—presumably his trouble
began at school owing to an inattentive
mistress; a third sleeps on a bed of
nails, and during the daytime attaches
huge weights to his limbs; and the
fourth amuses himself by gazing at the
sun for long intervals. It is not expected
that any of the quartet will be honored
with doctorates by the University, as will
happen to John Masefield, but they
should add to the general gaiety. There
is a lady with the party who is reputed
“For heaven's sake, hurry ! The boat is sinking!”
“But are you quite sure this lifebelt suits me?”
to be bullet-proof. The gentleman who
desires to introduce fhe four to Mel-
bourne has written to the council guar-
anteeing' that they are genuine “holy
men” ; that is to say, sadhus. If that is so,
it is strange to find them in a circus
sideshow, for the sadhu is an ascetic
who practises these austerities for a re-
ward in the hereafter or to be spared
reincarnation in an insect or a reptile.
It would be as unusual to meet him
being exhibited for profit as to, find the
Archbishop of Melbourne appearing as
a St. Simeon Stylites in a pole-sitting
competition.
“F.E.H.”: Cigarette-cards are becom-
ing the small boy’s Bible, the faith in
them being too stubborn to be shaken
by any ocular evidence. Just before the
Australian cricket team left for England,
Tim Wall honored our school with a
visit. After his brief address young
Tommy turned to me with the amazing
remark: “Not much like him, is he?”
i|: * * *
“Barcoo Shout”: It was at Jundah
(W.Q.), more years ago than I care to
remember. Brumby had spent all he had
on his annual spree. He wandered shakily
into the bar on the off chance, and rapped
on the counter with trembling fingers.
Mrs. Public-house came from the back
somewhere, saw it was Bfumby, snorted
with disgust and went back to her laun-
dry job. Brumby watched her go. When
all was clear he managed to lever him-
self on to the counter. From there he
reached across and opened the till,
grabbed where the grabbing was good,
and dropped back on his own side. Next
time he rapped on the counter it was
with real money he knocked. Mrs.
P.-H. knew the sound of that. She left
her tubs and came with a run. And
Brumby, with the air of an outraged
duke, rated her sharply for keeping a
gentleman with money waiting for his
refreshments.
“King’s Regs”: The alleged distinction
in feminine eyes of “walking out” with
a band guardsman (B. 26/9/’34) will
perhaps be less coveted when it is under-
stood that they don’t perambulate in
their bearskin headgear. Their walking-
out dress is different, with just an ordi-
nary forage cap. Probably in these ad-
vanced days they even walk out in civ-
vies, and a guardsman without the pad-
ding and the flummery of his uniform
looks no more exciting than a parson.
“Binduli”: When the late Tommy
Walker was a Westralian editor he had
a high regard for discipline. Appointed
to a goldfields Sunday paper that had been
run in a markedly happy-go-lucky manner,
Tommy announced that for the future
every member of the staff must report
himself to the editor on his arrival in
the morning, also on Saturday evening,
when the working hours were from
about seven to after midnight. I can still
recall the first Saturday on which the
innovation came into force. Several of
us had arrived and, either gravely or
grinningly or in careless dumb show,
drawn the editor’s attention to our
appearance when the mining reporter
lurched in with the latest bulletins from
the Golden Mile and the share reports.
Saturday was always a strenuous day for
him, albeit Scotch and seasoned, for he
had to see a lot of hospitable managers
and thirsty brokers. Projecting himself
a trifle unsteadily into the editorial
sanctum he stood a moment in thought,
as if groping for some half-forgotten for-
mula. Then his face brightened up ; he
solemnly raised a hand and went through
the motion of pulling a forelock, as the
old-time sailor used to do. (It was only
a motion, because he happened to be
very bald.) “Come aboard, sir,” he re-
ported with husky cheerfulness. Within
a week the office had relapsed into its
old ways.
H< $
“Nakhoda”: Reported that during the
Duke of Gloucester’s visit to the Cinga-
lese mountains the Tillu shrub obligingly
bloomed, its previous public appearance
having been during the Prince of Wales’s
visit in 1922. There are several tropical
flowers which are parsimonious in re-
vealing their glories, but none more so
. than the celebrated night lily. As far
as I know there is only one plant of the
kind in Malaya ; owned by a Chinaman
of Ipoh, it flowers one night a year, and
then for not more than four hours. The
date of the approaching wonder is an-
nounced in the papers even as far south
as Singapore. Pilgrims to the shrine
arrive from all parts, and there is
low tide in the old gentleman’s samshu
jar afterwards.
* * * *
“Centurion”: it looks as if the next
war will not lack the variety which was
often missing in the last. For instance,
the aeroplane always advertised its com-
ing in time for infantry to take cover or
cavalry to scatter in the open. Not long
ago it was announced that Britain had
perfected a silencer which makes the
’plane absolutely inaudible. Also an
automatic gun firing 21b. shells —the old
pom-pom size—has now been devised for
’planes which had to be content with
various types of m.-gs. in the last show.
Powerful springing takes the recoil, which
has always previously supplied a prob-
lem. In 1916 Britain tried a shell-firing
gadget in Sinai. It fired a shell out of
one end and a blank charge from the
other intended to offset the “kick.” It
didn’t, and at the second trial the ’plane
turned several somersaults and caught
fire. It was never seen again, and no
R.A.F. man regretted its. disappearance.

“Erua”: A M.L. legal firm sent a
strongly-worded letter to a lady in the
country who had long overlooked a
client’s account. , “Don’t bother to
send any more of those bluffing screeds
to me,” wrote the young woman in reply.
“I intend to pay you when I have the
money. At present, owing to a bad
season, my husband and I are broke.
And as I was 10 years in a lawyer’s office
I know just what those letters are worth,
having written hundreds of them myself.
Save your paper!” They decided to
save it.

T. THE R.


“Kerys”: My neighbor Binks told
me that his missus was bent on accom-
panying him to the wrestlin’ at the
Stadium that night. I hinted that it
might be a bit rough for a lady, but
Binks said Mrs. Binks had been told all
that. I saw him on Sunday morning over
the fence, and from his dejected air I
gathered his overnight experience had
been a chastening one. ‘‘Too right!” he
agreed gloomingly. “There was a boxing
prelim. She thought the first round rather
fun. Then there were a few drops of
blood, and she started shuddering. Pres-
ently she screamed, and hung around my
neck moaning that she couldn’t stand any
more. When a bloke behind said ‘Take
the poor old girl home,’ she screamed
worse, and then she fainted. 1 was haul-
ing her out with the help of a couple of
fellows when a man said, ‘This ain’t no
place for old dames,’ and she up with
her umbrella and hit him over the head.
He wanted to fight me, but 1 dragged
her out and got a taxi home. She hasn’t
spoken to me since.” Then he lurched
unhappily in to get his own breakfast.
“Somnus”: In Ton Idriess’s latest book,
“The Yellow Joss,” a pair of divers,
rivals in love, are represented as carry-
ing out a dumb argument on the ocean
bed. Apart from
grimaces and gestures,
they abuse one an-
other by scratching
comments on a large
rock. Surely “Gouger"
should know that two
divers, while under
water, can converse
quite easily by placing
Iheir helmets together.
“Hey, do you need any help?"
“Not a bit! We’re just waiting for the sea to dry up so’s we can walk ashore.”
“Harrison A.”: A young man who
seems to have the makings of a Jack
Sheppard about him has cropped up in
Queensland ; he has already broken out
of three gaols or lock-ups, at Towns-
ville, Rockhampton and Warwick, and
from a fourth at Albury (N.S.W.). Even
assuming that provincial cages are lack-
ing in the solidity of big prisons, the Wai-
wick achievement was certainly a re-
markable one. The prisoner was left leg-
ironed in his cell (presumably because
of his previous record for elusiveness),
but he wrenched a handle off his cell-
bucket in the small hours, gouged bricks
from the wall with his improvised tool,
pounded one of his hobbles loose with
the bricks, and finally scaled a formidable
12-foot wall with his irons still trailing
from one leg. After that his luck didn t
hold ; he was recaptured after a lew
days, as in his previous bids for Ireedom.
“Jake B”: Men of the 6th reinforce-
ments to the 13th Battalion, enlisting in
Sydney late in May, 1915, were under
fire on Gallipoli before the end of July.
Can anyone beat that for hurry-up? To
illustrate my own rawness, it was not
until the troopship was approaching
Egypt that I learned that the brass disc
on the butt of my rifle opened and
shut, and contained a neat little bottle
of gun oil. I had thought it was there
just for ornament.
“James Pigg”: That overworked phrase
“the sport of kings” (B. 26/9/’34) was
coined by Peter Beckford, whose
“Thoughts on Hunting” remains after 300
years the foxhunler's Bible. Peter wrote
of foxhunting, but he had in mind the
savage forest laws which the Norman
kings brought from France. Under these
every forest in England became a royal
demesne, wherein anyone found with-
out license was killed by keepers.
It was death also to kill a deer
or a hoar, for these were royal game.
The laws remained in force for 500
years and more. One advantage of them
was that they preserved many of Eng-
land's noblest forests for posterity. Also
they took little cognisance of small
ground game, and the villein was always
free to catch a rabbit for himself, a right
taken away in times allegedly more civi-
lised.
“Barbarossa”: It seems to me that
nothing is more likely to arrest the
modern feminine craze for athletics than
the suggestion that it is favorable to the
growth of whiskers. It all began with
an allegation voiced by B. C. Sims,
manager of the South African Empire
Games team, that some of the foreign
ladies who took part in the recent world
competitions were males in disguise. The
statement, of course, was promptly and
hotly contradicted —one German news-
paper stigmatised it as “a grotesque
slander, showing the lengths of absurdity
to which hatred of Germany can go,
even in sport.” On the other hand, it was
admitted, even by those who ridiculed
Sims’s suspicions, that some of the
athletes whose sex he had questioned had
at least one essentially masculine attri-
bute. A Canadian competitor stated
that some of the ladies shaved, particu-
larly the Germans; a Rhodesian wit-
ness went a bit further —“Quite a few
had strong beards, and had to shave
daily.” If this sort of thing is ever estab-
lished as one of the dangers of trying to
break records, I predict a great slump in
feminine activities by field and flood.
“Lao-dah”: I ob-
serve, not without
regret, that one of
my compatriots has
overreached himself,
disregarding the
teachings of the sub-
lime Confucius, who
advised moderation
in all things. As he
was departing with
dignity and without
haste from an over-
seas steamer at Mel-
bourne a Customs
man noticed that his
emaciated face con-
tradicted the portli-
ness of his body.
Passing his hands
over the new arrival,
the officer came on
a rug and two
cushions. Investigat-
ing further, he dis-
covered 14 yards of
the very best wShan-
tung silk cleverly
wrapped round his
man’s abdomen.
Further sleuthing
disclosed that one of
the cushions was
heavier than the
other, the discrep-
ancy being due to
its having been
stuffed with 50
yards of silk instead
of the usual feathers.
The foolish fellow’s
name was Chin Ah
Wit. “Wit” in our
language does not
mean what it means
in English.
“Morimoto”: History casts an enor-
mous shadow across our radios, tele-
phones and commercial air services. It
is well known that pagan temples were
built on foundations of human bodies,
and there are also traditions of bridge
designers kidnapping and burying child-
ren under their edifices to repair faults
in Ihe construction. Dyak chiefs still
bury hens at the corners of new houses,
, where they buried human heads before
Rajah Brooke’s time. The latest resur-
rection of the myth is at Kuala Lumpur,
F.M.S., where the natives are staying in
o’ nights so that the British authorities
won't deprive them of their top-pieces, it
having been reported that the engineers
are having trouble with a break in the
Johore causeway. I remember having
to walk from duty after dark in Singa-
pore 25 years ago, my rickshaw coolie
merely dumping me with the laconic re-
mark “Finish!” and disappearing at full
speed back to the city. It turned out that
there was a hew bridge being built in
the vicinity.
“The McHaggis”: Some surprise has
been expressed by English newspapers
because Ramsay MacDonald could not
understand a word of a Gaelic address
read to him by the Bluenoses on his re-
cent arrival in Nova Scotia. Some of
ihe Canadian papers have also
deplored that Scotland’s most
J i st i n g u i shed son doesn't
‘know a word of his native
tongue.” But, though he bears
a Highland name, Ramsay
Mac comes of generations of
Lowlanders. Why should a
Lowland Scot, however distinguished, be
expected or required to understand the
jabberings of an alien tongue the very
use of which was proscribed for years
after the “Forty-five”?
% # sfc sfc
“Tarry Rope”: All sorts of illustra-
tions have been used to impress upon the
public mind the massiveness of the new
Cunarder, named Queen Mary: she is
three times the size of the Strathnaver
and the Strathaird, both of which look
like floating cities ; if she could be forced
into narrow King-street, Sydney, her
length would run from George-street
almost to St. James’s Church. But the
thing that impresses me most is the
200,000 h.-p. Just try to conjure up a
picture of that pulling weight in ani-
mals! Putting the neddies eight abreast,
the equivalent team would extend, giving
reasonable space for movement, over
25 miles!
* *
“Sixenate”: A remarkable matri-
monial tangle has just been pre-
sented to the N.S.W. Divorce Court.
A young man married three women, the
first being his aunt, a union voidable
because it comes within the prohibited
degrees of relationship. Action for
nullity was taken successfully, but before
the decree was made absolute the mar-
riage with the second woman took place.
Later on, the adventurous person led a
third partner to the altar or the registry
office. The first “wife” is free; the
FILM-STRUCK BEE : “Gee, honey . but you’re sweet!”
others took action together to have their
affairs straightened out. The Court's
puzzle was whether the marriage with
the aunt was void from the beginning. II
it was, the much-wedded man was mar-
ried legally to his second wife ; if not, the
second marriage was a bigamous union
and the third may be held valid. The
Court has its head in ice whilst it pon-
ders the problem.
“Agrestis”: “S.T.S.’s” reminder (B.
26/9/’34) that South Australia was
originally designed by its London
founders to be a “gentleman-farmer’s
Utopia” recalls a passage from a book
written by Lady Broome, wife of a West-
raiian Governor in the ’eighties. The
vice-regals had been making a trip up
north, and “a few miles outside Don-
garra,” chronicled the lady, “we were
met by a cavalcade of gentlemen-farmers,
who escorted us into the township.”
Whether the struggling cockies of the
period and the region would have recog-
nised themselves under that picturesque
description is hard to say.
* * * *
“Jacky Roo” (Canada): Was I correct
in telling people here that the kidnap-
ping of Canuck millionaire brewer John
Labatt, the first case of its kind in
Canada, had no parallel in Aus-
tralia? I can’t recall one. The
Labatt affair was as mysterious as
a fiction thriller. It was not until five
hours after the brewer was released thai
the police knew anything about it,
although the millionaire, unshaven and
haggard, walked into Toronto’s poshest
hotel just after midnight and eluded
about 40 American newspapermen and
posses of plainclothes men. The Labatts’
“lips are sealed,” because the kidnappers
threatened death if the luckless beer king
opened his mouth. On the other hand,
the police are furious, and the Ontario
Attorney-General promises legislation
giving the police authority to close the
bank accounts, seal the deposit vaults
and generally take charge of the rela-
tives of any future kidnapped Canadian.

“A.8.C.”: Touching the hazardous
plight of persons unfortunate enough to
be trapped in freezing chambers (B.
29/8/ ’34), an easy way of sending an
SOS would be to fuse the lights in the
establishment by taking out an electric-
bulb and short-circuiting the points with
a knife-blade, key or anything else
handy. The performance could be re-
peated every time the trouble was re-
paired at the fuse-box till someone
looked for the source of it in the right
place. A more commonsense plan would
be to compel the instalment of an alarm-
bell 'in all cold chambers.
ON THE HALF-SHELL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
■‘Oysters are not- really a food; they are more of
a stimulant to appetite.” —ltem from, thr Health
Inspectors' conference at Sydney.
Uncork the stout and hand me the cayenne;
To-night Lucullus with himself shall feed
When these are polished off, but not till then.
Their destined job is merely to precede
And usher in the victuals that 1 need,
The solid fare I'll stow away to-night;
They’re not de facto tucker, that’s agreed,
Merely a stimulus to appetite.
With all the gourmet’s gentle zest 1 ken
Each dainty morsel of the bivalve breed,
Anticipating in its shelly den
The squeeze of lemon custom has decreed.
How almost pensively they seem to plead
To be devoured and, speechless, to invite!
But not as real fodder. No, indeed!
They’re merely there to whet my appetite.
For these Imperial Rome was craving when
Her legions, Julius Caesar in the lead,
Swooped down upon our woad-stained country-
men
And drove the chariots back in mad stam-
pede.
Oysters—or anyhow that's what we read —
Supplied the raison d’etre for the fight
And conquest, even then being guaranteed
To ginger up a languid appetite.-
What ho, Diego! Open me with speed
Another dozen! Not for food, too right!
I seek, before the dinkum meal proceed,
An adventitious aid to appetite.

POLITICAL POINTS
The defeat of Guy (Bass), Blacklow
(Franklin) and Hutchin (Denison) has
placed Lyons in a position in which no
Prime Minister has ever been before or
may ever be again. He will go to the
new House of Reps, with only one sup-
porter from his own State.
Scullin-Labor will have one supporter
from N. S. Wales, the veteran Watkins,
and it can thank the U.A.P. for him.
Had Lyons’s new party put up a man
in Newcastle, Watkins would assuredly
have gone the way of Blakeley and
Ted Riley.
Vic. will send 11 U.A.P. men to the
new House of Reps., and eight of the
11 were Diggers. N. S. Wales will have
11, too, but only two were in the A.1.F.;
a third —Jennings, of Watson —saw
S’African war service. Had Blacklow
and Hutchin got back, returned soldiers
would be in a clear majority of the
party ; as it is, they will be strong enough
to see that Diggers get a square deal and
pacifism short shrift.
Four Lang members returned thanks
on the same day, and (obviously speak-
ing to orders) all predicted another elec-
tion at an early date. There will be an-
other election, and their leader will per-
form as usual, and be licked again—
the fourth time in three years or so.
Melbourne “Age” wiped Brand’s name
off its Senate ticket, which was composed
of an Imperial Freetrader, a Labor-
socialist and a Protectionist. The A.I.F.
man was the first Senator elected. Still,
the “Age” got one of its three right
(Leckie); which was more than it suc-
ceeded in doing three years ago. Then
the candidate favored with its support
nearly lost his deposit.
Two imitation dictators, “generals”
both, have fallen within the last few
days—General Johnson and General
O’Duffy. In each case the ejection was
accompanied by soothing words; Gen-
eral Johnson was urged by President
Roosevelt to “take a much-deserved
long rest,” and General O’Duffy was
thanked by the Cosgrave party for his
“great services to Ireland.” The O’Duffy
predicted that his Blue Shirts would be
“masters of Ireland in three years.” In
less than a twelvemonth he was out on
his ear.
“Come on under the plum-tree, Earlie!
There’s three plums — well, two and
a kernel —for you.”
According to Launceston “Examiner,”
“opinion within the A.W.N.L. is that Bass
was lost to the U.A.P. because immunity
was granted to the sitting member,” and
it “finds that argument difficult to under-
stand” —Heaven knows why. There is a
type of Nat. who won’t have Labor “con-
verts” foisted on him, and, if offered no
alternative, will throw his vote away.
Wiser than the Nats, and the mainland
Labor parties, Tas. Labor ran two men
against Guy and four against Hutchin,
and with the personal support thus en-
sured accounted for both.
Although the U.A.P. will have many
returned-soldier members in the new
Parliament, it is suggested in Mel-
bourne that Parkhill may be appointed
“Him Minister of Defence! Wot about
me and me mop?”
Minister of Defence. Parkhill! But
perhaps there has been a confusion of
names, and it is really intended to ap-
point Mrs. Partington, of the mop.
After June 30 Scullin-Labor will need
a new leader and deputy-leader in the
Senate, Jack Barnes having been downed
in Victoria and Michael Raphael O’Hal-
loran in South. Aus. Perhaps Mac-
Donald will step into Barnes’s place,
since he will have been longer in the
Senate than any Laborite entitled to con-
tinue beyond July I—though1—though not much
longer. Mac was appointed in July, 1922,
when John Adamson died, and defeated
the same year; appointed again in Aug.,
1928, on Givens’s death, and defeated in
that year, too. Prior to his 1922 experi-
ence “Jupp” Gardiner was the only
Labor man in the Senate —both general
and army, as it were.
When Labor leaders fall they fall like
Lucifer. Who remembers McCormack?
Theodore returned from abroad, full of
importance, and proffered his sympathy
to the anti-Labor parties, doomed, he
said to wage a hopeless and endless battle
against his party: “Labor is in for all
time.” Now the place that knew the
prophet knows him no more. During the
recent campaign no one bothered to ask
where Theodore was or why he wasn’t
standing. And Willis, who played Luden-
dorff to Lang’s Hindenburg —got rid of
his A.W.U. enemies, ran .his newspaper
for him, led for him in the Leg. Council
and went to England for him as A.-G.
Poor Willis stood for Barton as an anti-
Lang Laborite and lost his deposit.
With the Commonwealth special grant
of £286,000, Forgan Smith expects to get
his 1934-35 deficit down to a million or
so, and evidently considers that Ostreliyah
ought to be greetful to him, ye ken.
And things might be even better:
If relief could be obtained from the
charge for exchange without any resultant
loss of national income, budgetary equili-
brium would be possible of attainment.
In other words, if the Australian pound
were equal in value to the pound, ster-
ling, Queensland might pay its way. It’s
a free country, and there is nothing to
prevent Foggy striving for equality it
he thinks the farming and mining in-
terests, whose votes he will be seeking
presently, would be pleased.
“Informal” topped the Senate poll in
the Speck ; it scored nearly 5000 more
than Grant’s total of primaries—and
Grant was the first man elected. Many
bright voung things, having been in-
structed to vote for all the 14 candidates,
took a firm mental grasp of the number
14 and inscribed it against each name
on the list. Many proceeded to write
15, 16, 17 and 18 on their House of Reps,
ballot-paper.
Queensland unemployed are objecting
strongly to having to pay 255. for an
A.W.U. ticket before they are allowed
on Government railway-construction
works. So far the Foggy Smith Govern-
ment has taken no notice, but this atti-
tude is dangerous. Westralian out-of-
works made the same protest, and the
Labor Government sided with the
A.W.U. Many of the complainants must
have avenged themselves by voting
against Labor candidates on September
15, when the party that had won 30 of
the 50 Slate Assembly seats could only
raise 60,000 votes for the Senate against
100,000 for the Nat.-C.P. ticket.
One sure way of making a pile in N.
S. Wales is to get a job or a sinecure
from a Labor Government and the sack
from the other side, or vice versa. Com-
pensation paid by Stevens to Lang ap-
pointees, as catalogued by the Auditor-
General, includes £1750 for M. B. Young
(he was put on the old Savings Bank
Board after the bank went bung);
£11,500 for Meat Boarders (£7OOO for
Scott, £3OOO for Hutt and £l5OO for
Kay); £16,687 for seven Industrial Com-
mission men, and £3500 for three mem-
bers of the Western Lands Commission
—their three successors, since put off,
are also to be recompensed. There were,
besides, cost and interest amounting to
£2629. No wonder the deficit roosts like
Poe’s raven.
One of Lang’s conciliation committee-
men who shared in the £16,687 forked
out by Stevens was a pugilist. He got
more from one bout with the Govern-
ment than for all his fights.
“Premier Forgan Smith will not be seen
in -frock-coat and top-hat during the visit
of the Duke of Gloucester to Queensland.
His idea is that citizens should be free to
wear the clothes to which they are accus-
tomed.”
“Whaur’s y’r uniform? Ye’re no’ free,
man—the ordinance disna apply to
princes.”
Is the A.W.U.’s political star setting?
Following on the unfortunate experience
of Jude, its Tas. secretary, at the State
election in the islet, general-president
Barnes has lost his Vic. Senate seat;
former-general-president Blakeley has
been licked in Darling (N.S.W.) and State
president Murphy failed in Grey (S.A.).
For 31 years the House of Reps, has
never been without A.W.U. men from
N. S. Wales and S.A., and now there will
be none.
The Man Without a Country was
scarcely a more pathetic figure than Joe
Lamaro, who was Lang's last Attorney-
General. Defeated in 1932, Lamaro got
in for Leichhardt at a by-election. In
his devotion to Lang he resigned to coo-
test the Watson Federal seat, first notify -
“How much longer must a bird fly
before he can land?”
ing the Speaker that he would stand
again for Leichhardt if he failed in
Watson. He failed ; and while he was
failing some other gentleman, equally
devoted to “Lang and Labor,” got the
party nomination for Leichhardt. So
poor Lamaro becomes the Man Without
a Seat.
Old King Coal, sitting uneasily on his
throne, still has power to exact human
sacrifices. An explosion in a mine at
Wrexham has rendered 260 Welsh homes
desolate. The men working in the pit
were caught in a raging sea of flame, and
nothing could be done for them, although
their mates strove for many hours with
the desperate heroism always shown on
these occasions, at times thet fire halt-
blinded them and scorched their feet.
Democracy is a grand thing, but when
such perils and sacrifices are confined
to a small section it is still far from com-
plete. In the brave new world all will
have to take their share of the dirty and
dangerous work as part of their prepara-
tion for life.
Queensland Opposition is losing H. E.
Sizer, M.L.A. for Sandgate and Minister
for Labor in the Moore Government;
he is giving up politics altogether and
going to Melbourne to attend to mining
interests. Members of his party blame
Sizer for the withdrawal of the bill re-
constituting the Leg. Council, but he
could say incisive things in debate. Re-
viewing his career at a send-off, he re-
marked, “No Royal Commission was
necessary when / left office.”
“Bill O’C.” is sceptical:
The Sydney Government has at length
promised to abolish the iniquitous, unfedeial
and doubtfully constitutional double—really
treble—tax imposed on residents of N.S.W. in
respect of income from other States already
taxed by those States and by the Common-
wealth. But abolition is subject to States
which have imposed similar taxes remitting
them so far as concerns income from N. S.
Wales. Two other States levy taxes ol
the same character. South Australia’s is only
partial: a special impost oii dividends derived
by local residents from any source—regardless,
of course, of the fact that they have already
paid tax elsewhere. Is Butler likely to legislate
for a discrimination in favor of income re-
ceived from a company which happens to be
registered in N.S.W.? It looks very doubtful.
The result of Stevens’s pinchbeck reform seems
likely to be more Premiers’ conferences with
procrastination and postponement in their wake.
[Responsibility for Commonwealth-election
matter in this issue is shared by J. E. Webb,
J. B. Dailey and M. H. Ellis, of 252 George-
street, Sydney.]

SHELL
AIR GAS
LAMPS, LANTERNS, STOVES, IRONS AND RADIATORS
which require petrol fuel give their greatest efficiency
when operating on Shell or Super Shell Spirit.
Although a super petrol, Super Shell is crystal clear,
and, like Shell, possesses the essential characteristics
to enable the fuel to vaporise quickly and com-
pletely, without the slightest deposition of residue
in the generating tubes.
For the brightest light and the greatest heat always use Shell or Super Shell Petrol

PERSONAL
ITEMS
Most Australians are convinced that
Kingsford Smith will win the centenary
air race if he can get to England in time ;
he must be there by the 14th. He set out
on Saturday with a certificate of a kind
and got as far as Cloncurry. Then some-
thing went wrong with the machine, and
he had to return to Sydney for repairs.
Now he hopes to start off again to-
morrow morning. Meantime a new solo
record has been put up by an Australian
—8 days 9 hours from Darwin to Lon-
don. The achievement stands to the
credit of the young South Australian
Melrose.
Lester Brain flies the first of the new
Australia-Singapore liners, now on its
way to Australia. A man with a firm
jaw, 32 years old, Brain was a bank clerk
after leaving Sydney Grammar. He be-
came an Air Force cadet at Point Cook
in 1923, and a year later a Qantas mail
pilot. He was promoted to be Brisbane
branch manager in 1927, and was just
back from a world tour two years later
when he was sent to find Keith Ander-
son’s missing Kookaburra and Moir and
Owen’s Vellore. Those adventures
gained him the Air Force Cross. Nowa-
days he is the Qantas concern's chief
pilot.
When John Cadman presented an Aus-
tralian party with enough petrol to see
it 13,000 miles across Asia and Aus-
tralia in 1926, he remarked that he would
“come and see you sometime.” Eight
years later here he is—a clean-shaven
man of medium height who doesn’t look
his 54 years, and whose quietness belies
Rear-Admiral FORD, as seen by Finey.
his experience. From a colliery man-
agership 30 years ago he has risen to the
chairmanship of Anglo-Persian Oil, is a
director of the Suez Canal Co., and has
been president of every first-rank body
concerned with engineering, petrol or
geology in the U.K. He is a G.C.M.G.,
a member of the Athenaeum and an
emeritus professor of Birmingham Uni-
versity.
Alderman O’Dea is now the only
Labor alderman at Sydney Town Hall
not in Parliament —and he has tried hard
enough to be there. Ward, Garden and
Mulcahy are Ms.H.R., Donald Grant is
an M.L.C. and Tommy Shannon an
Assemblyman.
R. J. Cameron, who has retired after
61 years in the service of the Adelaide
“Advertiser” and “Chronicle” —he was
printer of the “Chronicle” for many
years—was a good stayer, but Australia
has seen longer-distance inky wayfarers.
Brisbane “Courier” had a man —Melton
—who worked in its office for over 70
years.
Rev. Dr. Charles Strong, who has
reached his 90th milestone in Melbourne,
was concerned in a heresy hunt of half
a century ago. Born in Scotland and
educated at Glasgow, he entered the Pres-
byterian Church, and in 1875 he came
to Scots Church, Collins-street. He got
into doctrinal holts with elders, and threw
up his ministry. He returned to Scotland,
and was invited to re-enter the church ;
but in the meantime his followers had
founded the Australian Church. A life-
long opponent of sweating and advocate
of prison reform, the doctor is one of
the best-liked pulpiteers in Melbourne,
though his little fane in Russell-street
has had no progeny.
The waters of an Irish bay have closed
over Major Kerr-Pearse. A dark, affable
little man, “Cah-Pahss,” as he called him-
self, was a familiar figure at Australian
Government Houses for many years:
extra A.D.C. to Northcote, secretary to
Novar, and “private” secretary to Strick-
land, Ellison-Macartney and Campion.
He never made an enemy, and he had
a sure formula for winning the hearts
of pressmen and presswomen susceptible
to flattery—“his Excellency the Gover-
nah is a great admirah of your papah.”
The major was one of a parly pitched
out of a speedboat; four lost their
lives. Miss Kerr-Pearse, who was
brought up in these parts, held up her
father till exhaustion overcame her.
W. T. Ford, Rear-Ad-
miral commanding the
Australian Navy, saw a lot
of Australians before tak :
ing over the job last April,
though he had only been
here once —as a “loot” on
the Pioneer 30 years ago.
In 1914 he helped
to stop the Turks
from crossing the Suez
Canal; then he went to
Gallipoli for Anzac Day,
commanding the Swift-
sure. He was in the land-
ings at Suvla and Helles,
and remained around the
Dardanelles . till the eva-
cuation ; then he joined
the Grand Fleet. After
the war he was captain of
the 30,000-ton Royal Oak,
and had charge first of
the Admiralty Physical
Culture School and finally
of the Portsmouth Navi-
gation School.
Sir Maurice Hankey,
secretary to the British
Cabinet, here for the Vic.
centenary and for any dis-
cussion with the Common-
wealth Government that
may arise, mentioned to
the Fremantle reporters
that he had “a lot of Aus-
tralian blood” in him.
He is a son of Robert Alers Han-
key, a South Australian pastoralist
in the long ago, who married into
the Bake well family. Two Hankey
girls and a boy were born in South Aus.
There were three sons; one wrote a
noted war book, “Student in Arms,” be-
fore he fell in France. In it he devoted
a moving passage to the impression
made on him by the fine character of
a woman he had met on a Westralian
farm. v n ,'
Dr. Loftus Cuppaidge, dead in Bris-
bane at 78, was a fine type of the Irish
medico so prominent in Queensland social
life at the end of last century and later.
A Trinity College man, he won his Irish
international Rugby Union cap before
taking out his diploma in 1884. He came
to Queensland the same year, and began
practice at Roma ; later he went to Gym-
pie and became interested in mining;
he also founded and commanded the
fifth L.H.F.A. at Gympie. In 1914 the
doctor organised and took over a base
hospital at Townsville, calling it a day
with the Armistice.
After many vicissitudes,
Maurice Blackburn be-
comes a Commonwealth
member at last, as An-
stey’s successor in Bourke;
and, though he has been a
State politician, off and
on, for 20 years, he is still
young enough to make his
mark at Canberra. Very
likely he will, for he has
qualities which extort the
admiration of his mosi
conservative opponents.
He inspires something
like affection in them, too ;
when he retired from the
Vic. Speakership to con-
test Bourke the “Argus”
wrote that the Assembly
had “lost a presiding offi-
cer who, by his ability,
courtesy and impartiality,
won the respect of all
parties.” Yet Blackburn
is a pacifist and a social-
ist, and is more than sus-
pected of being willing to
accept Lang’s leadership.
Born at Inglewood (Vic.),
he went to the Melbourne
University from the C. of
E. Grammar School, and
has been a barrister and
solicitor since 1910. He
married into a Victorian
branch of the Hordern
family.
Charlie Brand, who topped the Vic.
Senate poll, .was born in Bundaberg,
where the best rum in the world is made.
He became a pupil teacher, and remained
in the teaching service until he went to
South Africa as a lieutenant in the 3rd
Q.M.I. As with most Queenslanders out-
side the metropolis who did not play
games, M.L work engaged his Saturday
afternoons, and he was a thoroughly com-
petent subaltern when he went to argue
with Kruger. With Chauvel and many
other Queensland M.I. officers, Brand
joined the C.M.F. He was an infantry
brigade-major at The Landing, where he
won the D.S.O. The story of his rise in
France is a long one; he was twice
wounded and eight times mentioned. At
the Armistice he was a Brig., and had
added a C.B. and a C.M.G. to his scalps.
Returning to Australia he passed through
nearly every military job in the Com-
monwealth service until his retirement.
A man of pleasant, unaffected personality,
he has always been popular with all ranks.
Langdon Bonython, the Adelaide
newspaper knight, who has just helped
along S.A. centenary arrangements by
giving £lOO,OOO towards the cost of com-
pleting the State Parliament House, has
made a habit of this sort of thing. Adel-
aide School of Mines, of which he has
been president since 1889, has often
benefited from his generosity, while the
University’s portion has included £20,000
to found a Chair of Law and £45,000
to build a Great Hall. The “Advertiser,”
of which the old Cornishman was editor
and sole proprietor for 35 years, became
a public company in 1929; but he is
still more or less in the saddle at 86, and
it seems likely that Adelaide will be cele-
brating his centenary next.
It is bad luck for A. W. Hutchin that
he should lose Denison just when he was
shaping well for promotion to the Min-
istry. Hutchin was an area officer before
the war, in which he was a brigade major
(of the 3rd) in Flanders. Afterwards he
went to the Staff College at Camberley,
where he graduated second on the list
against competition from all parts oi the
Empire. Back in Australia, he was named
Inspector of Universal Training, but' the
politicians surrendered to a wave of paci-
fism, and Hutchin left the service—to
become an industrial officer for Elec-
trolytic Zinc. His good work in that
capacity helped him into Parliament three
years ago, and not a few unionist prefer-
MAURICE BLACKBURN, Frank Anstey’s
successor in Bourke.
ences went to him on Sept. 15. Under
any other leadership he might have held
the seat, but Lyons stocks have slumped
in Tasmania.
Rev. W. G. Taylor, dead in Lindfield
(Sydney) at just on 90, long outlived
his fame as a preacher ; but 40 years
ago such crowds flocked to the Cen-
tenary Hall in York-street to hear him
that frequently there had to be over-
flow services. Taylor took charge of
the York-street Methodist Church when
it had 16 regular adherents; soon he
secured support for the creation of the
Centenary Hall, the headquarters of the
Methodist' Central Mission, for the
creation of which he was largely respon-
sible. Presently Ebenezer Vickery bought
the old Lyceum Theatre, and handed it
over as a gift. Taylor was a Yorkshire-
man. He could write almost as well as
he could speak.
A little birthday party:
W. M. Hughes reached three score and ten
on September 25. Years ending in 4 have been
big ones for Billy. He came to Australia in
’B4; became Labor member in ’94; joined his
first Commonwealth Ministry in ’O4; and 1914
brought the war and success for the party in
which he was second, and presently first. And
1934 may see him back to Ministerial rank.
When I first met him he was dark and unlined
of face and had a collar like an Indian s
stockade, a straw hat and the mien of Jehovah
asking Job out of the whirlwind, “Where wast
thou when I laid the foundation of the earth?"
Then he comes back to memory as a tired little
person who swore mightily, sometimes received
visitors in his shirt, and heaved pin-trays and
epigrams with equal violence and accuracy.
Now he has mellowed into a dapper old gentle-
man who bears no grudges and sulks no more.
I wonder every time I see him what the Billy
of 1904 would say if he met the Right Hon.
W. M. of 1934. The occasion would certainly
produce a phrase which could be remembered,
if not repeated.

Since this 97-yeaivold Anglo-Australian
institution -last made up its figures, and
sent them to London and back again, a
Federal election has been fought on the
issue of nationalised banking. The
electors decided that this was no time
for radical experiments with money,
there being troubles enough without
creating new ones.
The board’s policy of issuing capital
at a high premium (as much as 120 p.e.
in 1924), thereby making a high nominal
rate of dividend inevitable in good times,
has been partly responsible for some
misconception about banking profits.
Actually, share premiums make the div.
worth no more than slightly over half
the declared rate on three of the four
millions of capital. Also, the fact that
there is visibly £4,954,032 of reserves
assisting share capital needs to be kept
in mind when considering actual earning
power, which is very moderate.
Last year an expansion of £3,232,519
in deposits was accompanied by a growth
of £2,443,863 in low interest-bearing
liquids and of £909,790 in advances.
Gross earnings slipped £95,844:

Exes, were pulled back £89,794, of which
£82,629 was in respect of provision for
taxation (£157,039), leaving the net
result £6050 lighter at a shade over 5 p.e.
on capital, or 2.2 p.e. on capital and
reserves combined.
The div. is paid in sterling, which
makes 5 p.e. worth 6j p.e. in Australian
currency. At £9 10s. the £l5 shares paid
to £5 (the other £lO is callable only in
the event of liquidation) return 3.2 p.e.
on a 6£ p.e. distribution. The investor
who looks for approximately 4 p.e. on
his money counts on a 6 p.e. div., worth
7£ p.e. in Australian notes with exchange
as it is. A 6 p.e. div. would call for no
more than 2.6 p.e. on capital and re-
serves combined, but it will be another
12 months or more before the co. gets
the full benefit of the present low deposit
rates.
The solid nature of the financial struc-
ture, and other things, are seen in the
next table:

When the books closed about 67 p.e.
of the deposits was interest-bearing as
against 70 p.e. a year earlier. Liquids
amounted to 40.4 p.e. of the liabilities to
the public, of whose money the bank
was holding £4 9s. for every pound of
its own. It is a strong position, but
means low earning power.

After they returned from the war, the
Coleses, who had a small shop at Col-
hngwood (Vic.), set to work to build
up a chain of stores in which the top
price would be 2s. 6d. There are now
31 stores scattered all over Australia,
nearly a million and a quarter of money
is used in the business, and turnover, not
disclosed for the last term, has stepped
along in this way:

Of the 2400-odd names on the share re-
gister, over 400 are those of employees.
Incidentally, in addition to award wages,
the 2000-odd employees get a bonus and
other pickings. Also, since 1922 the co.
has donated over £25,000 of its profits to
hospitals and other charitable institutions.
After handing the prefs. their 8 p.c., the
ords. have had a steady 10 p.c., sweet-
ened by new issues on favorable terms,
over the last four years, and there is
nothing in sight at the moment to sug-
gest that the 10 p.c. is likely to be inter-
fered with.
Last year’s gross earnings (£801,382)
were £103,818 better, and exes. (£703,055,
including £24,000 set aside for taxation
and some non-recurring expenditure in
connection with new stores) took £94,626
of the increase. Including £11,450
(£15,000 in the previous year) dropped
from somewhere into the freehold depre-
ciation reserve (now £45,000), the net
result was up £5642. But there was more
capital to feed ; after paying the pref.
div., enough remained to show 13.8 p.c.
on ord. capital as against 16.3, 14.1, 11.5,
16.8, 18.7 and 17.8 p.c. back to 1928.
There was an all-round expansion in
balance-sheet figures, due to completion
of the new Liverpool-street, Sydney,
store, put up on a freehold bought from
Snow’s, the opening of two shops in Tas-
mania, one in Bendigo, and transfer of
another in Bourke-street, Melbourne, to
the other side of the road:

The net growth in the book value of
fixed assets was £137,078. To meet the
outlay and carry an extra £45,913 of
stocks, £75,014 was added to the amount
coming to sundry creditors, and £73,728
of uncalled capital was gathered. Taking
the £130,000 due in 1939 into the reck-
oning, the more or less liquid surplus
(£130,885) was £11,858 lighter.

Between the accounts and methods of
this investment trust and the per-
plexing atfairs of the McArthur brood
of so-called trust and other tangled
concerns, there is all the difference
in the world. From the outset the
board has adopted a policy of complete
frankness, disclosing the full contents of
the co.’s investment portfolio, and has
followed closely the sound principles es-
tablished by successful English and Scot-
tish trusts.
The first aim of a well-managed in-
vestment trust should be security of
capital; and that usually means a judi-
cious spread of risks and moderate re-
turns until substantial reserves have been
built up. These reserves are the corner-
stone of this class of business ; capital
profits arising from the exchange of
securities are used not for dividends but
to swell the volume of investments and
returns therefrom. A trust should also
offer the investor expert service at small
cost, thus relieving him of the anxiety of
managing a small portfolio to the best
advantage.
Judged on this basis, Were’s Trust has
put up a very satisfactory performance,
considering that it was formed in 1928,
just before the big break in the markets.
In its first term it netted 7.4 p.c. on aver-
age capital and paid a 6 p.c. div. Then
part of the co.’s Australian investments
was sold, the money was transferred to
London at a low rate of exchange, and
there invested in European and American
securities. But slump was a world-wide
phenomenon, and net earnings fell to 2
p.c. on capital in 1931, when share-
holders were passed by. They have since
had two lots of 2\ p.c., followed by 3 p.c.
for the last term, when the investments
turned in £16,366, up £3457. Returns
from underwriting, etc. (£1816), were
£3323 lighter. Exes. (£3459, including
£l2OO set aside for the taxgatherer) were
pulled back £lB6O, leaving enough to
show 3.9 p.c. on capital. That is disre-
garding a profit of £7655 on sale of in-
vestments.
Balance-sheet figures are interesting:

Speaking generally, the profitable use of
borrowed money involves a rising
market. Looked at' in this way the co.’s
loan account (up £130,416 last year) is
a sort of market barometer. At June 30
the market value of investments was
£38,950 short of their book value as
against £78,926 at the previous balance,
and the gap continues to narrow. That
leaves the difference in exchange value
between British and Australian curren-
cies (£A26,059 in the co.’s favor) out
of the reckoning. Since the co. can sit
tight and await developments, the ques-
tion of capital depreciation of its hold-
ings is not an urgent one calling for im-
mediate adjustment. Of the total hold-
ings about 95 p.c. is within the British
Commonwealth, where, broadly speak-
ing, recovery has been steadier than else-
where, thanks largely to political stability
and sane public finance.
The fully-paid ss. shares, covered by
net tangibles with a book value of ss. 4d.,
are at par or thereabouts on the market.

This general storekeeping concern is
having unusual difficulty in getting out
of the doldrums. During the boom it
built up a large mail-order connection,
bought the businesses of the Civil Service
Stores and Margaret Halstein, absorbed
Chapmans, a neighbor, connected the
Adelaide- and Queen-street premises by
a subway and extended and improved
the buildings. Then slump and all its
concomitants, including fierce competi-
tion, which means price-paring, played
havoc with debtors’ balances and stocks,
especially slow-moving lines. The aggre-
gate net result of the last four years’
trading is a loss of £34,609, and the
ords. have gone without; they aver-
aged a shade over 7 p.c. for the half-
dozen years before that, with little to
spare.
Last term the spring in turnover was
over 3 p.c., and gross earnings (£116,170)
were £8432 better. Including something
struck off for depreciation, an uspecified
amount for goodwill (its existence was
not hitherto mentioned), alterations to
premises, and bad debts and stocks, exes.
(£137,283) were £17,149 heavier. That left
the net result £21,113 on the wrong side,
and raised the amount of ord. capital
unrepresented by tangibles to £22,374.
To clean the slate and provide a re-
serve of £4787 to cover “any uncertainty
in assets,” 2s. per share (£27,162) is to
be struck off the 271,615 ords., reducing
them to 18s, each. The £50,000 of pref.
money remains untouched, but the div.
is to be lowered from 7 p.c. to 5 p.c. as
from Jan. 27, 1933, and arrears (2 p.c.)
cancelled. Paid capital will then be
£294,453, and the pref. div. plus 3+ p.c.
to the ords. will call for £11,056.
The market prices the ords. at 14s. as
against 12s. 6d. a year ago. The return
at the higher figure would be 5 p.c. on
a 3-V p.c. div. basis. The net tangible
cover (book value) is 18s. 4d. ords. and
£5 19s. Bd. prefs., which seldom come on
to the market.

a special cash distribution of 124 p.c.
(£20,740), charged to reserves.
The industry is not nearly so heavily
overcapitalised in S. Aus., where this co.
and S. Aus. Portland divide the lion’s
share of the majket, as it is in the Eastern
States. Moreover, Adelaide Cement has
as much invested outside the business in
Government stocks, etc., as in it, and that
has helped to steady earnings. For the
four years to the close of accounts in
1930 the ords. got a steady 15 p.c., fol-
lowed by 12} p.c. and then two lots of
10 p.c. Moreover, 10 p.c. is now worth
14.9 p.c. on capital as it stood before
the gift' issue (£55,028) in 1925.
Owing to continued improvement in
the construction trades, there was a
further spring of £5746 in last year’s de-
clared net earnings. After the prefs.
got their £l2OO, enough remained to
show 19.6 p.c.—the best yet—on ord.
capital as against 16.2, 11.6, 12, 13.8 and
13.5 p.c. back to 1929. Since the co.’s
purse was full, a special 12} p.c. cash
distribution (£20,740) was sent out half
way through the term, making p.c.
for the year. The special payment was
charged to reserves, the net reduction
in which was £4585. Free reserves
(now £30,032) increased by £6155, and
the depreciation reserve was reduced by
£10,740 net, leaving it at £111,760,
equal to 73.7 p.c. of the book value of
fixed assets. Most of the 1925 gift was
furnished out of this provision for “de-
preciation” ; it is plain, therefore, that
at least part of it is genuine profit.
When the books closed the deprecia-
tion and other reserves, and more be-
sides, were all represented by Govern-
ment securities, etc., down £24,934:

This is the co. which took over the then
70-odd-year-old business of Menzies
Hotel. Melbourne, in 1924, for £283,500,
including £39,000 for the license—
£l7s,ooo in fully-paid ords., £24,500 cash
and a mortgage to the vendor for the
balance (£84,000). To meet the cash
payment and provide for alterations and
additions to the premises, the public put
up £135,000 in 8} p.c. cum. prefs. For
the first 5\ years profits averaged £26,433
p.a., or more than twice the annual pref.
requirements, after allowing for which
enough remained to show 8.5 p.c. on
ord. capital, and 6 p.c. was distributed
for the four years to mid 1929. Then,
on the heels of the Federal Government’s
trek from Melbourne to Canberra, came
slump, and reserves had to be tapped
for £2112 to pay the prefs. an annual
4} p.c. for the three years to the close
of accounts in 1933.
Owing to the change in outlook, the
prefs. have agreed to forego arrears of
divs. (£17,214) to June 30, 1933, and
from that date to reduce the div. from
8i p.c. to 6 p.c. cumulative, with the
right to advance point for point with the
ords. after the latter have had 4 p.c.
The road is thus clear for the resump-
tion of ord. divs. when earnings permit.
In return the ords., who have gone with-
out for the last four years, have sui-
rendered 27,000 of their shares, which
are to be distributed among the prefs.
in the proportion of one for five.
Net earnings improved £2410 last term,
reaching £B2lB, or £llB more than the

Is your wife only
HALF PROTECTED?
IT is a good citizen who assures his life, but there
are many good citizens who are not adequately
assured; their families are only half protected.
For how much, then, should a man be assured ? That
depends on his obligations. He should aim to assure
himself for enough to give his wife and family
security and reasonable comfort after his death. The
sum of £500 invested at 4 per cent, will give a widow
an income of less than ten shillings a week. It is not
enough, but a £500 policy is a good start for a man
to make.
In 1907 a certain man, then aged 29, joined the
A.M.P. Society and assured himself for £2,000. The
premium was less than a pound a week. He died
recently and (so extraordinarily satisfactory are
A.M.P. bonuses) his wife received £3,500. Invested
wusely, that sum will return her about £3 a
Little enough, but a great comfort to a woman in
distress.
A man should begin with a £500 policy and add other
policies as his income increases; that way lie peace
of mind and security. The wise man will talk over
this all-important question with an A.M.P. counsellor
or, if he live far from an A.M.P. office, vrill ask that
the book, Investing in Happiness,” be sent to him.
The wise man will write at once.

pref. div. called for. The centenary cele-
brations, however, should give the cur
rent year’s earnings a nice lift, and it
is quite probable that the drought for the
ords. will be broken. Sellers ask 14s. for
the scrip, at which price the return would
be 5 p.c. on a p.c. div. basis. The
prefs. at 245. return 5 p.c. on a 6 p.c.
distribution. Excluding the license, in
at £39,000, the net tangible cover is £2
Is. lOd. prefs. and 16s. lOd. ords., all in
premises, etc., worth what they can earn.

Atlas Glass Manufacturers Corp., Ltd.
Because it continues to receive more
orders than it can fill, and encouraged by
promises of a lot more support, Allied
Glass Manufacturers, Ltd., which re-
cently set up works at Alexandria, Syd-
ney, now proposes to launch out on a
large scale. Hence this new co., which
has a nominal capital of £500,000 in £1
shares, is on the market with 200,000 of
them. Briefly, the idea is to take over
the Allied business as a going concern,
buy the freehold, enlarge the plant, etc.,
and put up new factories at Melbourne
and Brisbane. Fresh capital expenditure
is put at £87,650, of which £69,950 is in
respect of plant, and the balance mainly
freeholds, etc. The price set upon, the
existing business is £32,500 in shares (no
cash). This includes plant, equipment,
etc., valued by H. E. Ross and Rowe at
£14,976, options to purchase freeholds
and leases at Sydney, Brisbane and Mel-
bourne on favorable terms, and an un-
specified amount of patent rights, good-
will, etc. The value placed upon the ven-
dor’s net tangible assets is not disclosed.
The Allied Co. was formed a few
months ago by J. W. Mackerras (he used
to be in the real-estate business in Mel-
bourne), with the assistance of some tech-
nical experts, who have had experience
in the manufacture of high-grade glass-
ware in Czecho-Slovakia, Germany and
Australia. These experts are share-
holders in the business, and their ser-
vices have been secured by contract for
an unspecified term. There is also a
possibility of one of the big Belgian glass
concerns becoming interested in the ven-
ture, which would mean much lo the co.
on the technical side.
No estimate of net earnings is given.
With prices as they are, and immediately
the new plant is in full swing (it will then
have an output value conservatively esti-
mated at £431,250), sales of £185,000
worth of stuff is reckoned upon. If the
figure reaches no more than £160,000,
the co. expects to be able to pay satis-
factory divs. Provided it is able to supply
distributors, especially big distributors,
with a full range of good-quality glass-
ware, its future appears to be encourag-
ing. There is, of course, the possibilitv
of a trade war with the prosperous Aus-
tralian Glass Co. Much depends upon
technical efficiency.
The co. is equipped with an imposing
board. Knight Henry Braddon is at the
head of the table, and with him are
Charles Lloyd Jones, C. A. Jaques, David
Gillespie, J. A. H. Webberley and J. W.
Mackerras (managing director).
The board may go to allotment when
50,000 shares have been applied for;
brokerage is 5 p.c. ( = £lO,OOO on full
issue), and it is intended to list the scrip
in due course.
Barrytown Gold Dredging
Barrytown Gold Dredging, Ltd., is an
offshoot of Alluvial Gold, which was
formed by Alluvial Tin before control
of the last-named passed to English in-
terests. Capital is £128,750 in 125,000
£1 ords. and 75,000 Is. deferred shares.
Of these 60,000 ords. and a like number
of deferreds are offered to shareholders
on Alluvial Gold’s register at Oct. 1, in
the proportion of three ords. and three
deferreds for one Alluvial. The balance,
together with any shares not applied for,
will be taken by the directors and staff
of Alluvial. The shilling shares are de-
ferred in respect of capital only; they
rank equally with the ords., on a share
for share basis, in respect of dividends,
surplus assets and voting power. An
uncommon feature is the absence of any
promoter’s consideration in fully-paids or
cash, and no commission is payable on
share subscriptions The purchase price
(£45,146) represents approximately the
cost of prospecting and the actual
moneys payable to original vendors of
the properties. The promoters thus ex-
press their confidence in the venture by
looking entirely to profits from mining,
not from the sale of the ground.
The property, about 19 miles north of
Greymouth (M.L.), consists of a belt of
coastal swamp, 18 to 50 chains wide and
3J miles long, overlaying gold-bearing
black sands of an average thickness of
12ft., and assaying Is. 3d. a yard. The
estimate average of all ground to be
handled (22,000,000 c.y.) is lOd. a yard
—10,000,000 c.y. of Is. 3d. stuff and
12,000,000 c.y. of 6d. dirt —with gold at
£6 an ounce. Bottom, which is loose
grey sand, varies from 10ft. to 40ft., and
the meffil is in a fine state of division. On
the selected area 229 bores were put
down, and there is a lot of payable
ground not included in the estimate. It
is proposed to equip the show with a
large bucket dredge.
On the board are. F. G. Pratten, J. M.
Newman, A. P. Penman and E. H.
Pratten.
Smithy’s old ’bus has been commis-
sioned to make the first traverses in the
Commonwealth and States £150,000
aerial and geological survey for minerals
in Northern Australia. The route will be
via Atherton, Georgetown, Herberton,
Chillagoe, Normanton, Croydon, Clon-
curry, Mt. Isa, Tennant’s Creek, The
Granites, Tanami, Hall’s Creek, Port
Headland and Pilbara and adjacent areas
in Westralia. On the return journey the
Katherine-Pine Creek and Arnhem
Land areas will be inspected. These pre-
liminary traverses are figured to take
from six to eight weeks, but it is not
expected that the whole job will be com-
pleted under about three years.
tjc' * *
The First Hit, Menzies, has been
added to Goldfields Australian Develop-
ment’s Westralian options—Moonlight, at
Wiluna, and the old Associated Northern,
at Kalgoorlie, are the others. If a fort-
night’s free sampling is satisfactory, the
First Hit owners get £5OOO deposit. A
further £30,000 is due six months hence,
and a final £40,000 in Sept., 1935, as well
as £75,000 in scrip in any co. formed to
work the show. Occasional high yields
have been obtained from the compara-
tively shallow workings. Money has been
freely spent on the Moonlight and Asso-
ciated Northern, and the Goldfields Co.
recently asked its shareholders (chiefly
New Consolidated Goldfields and its
associates) for more.

An interesting geological feature
which may have an important influence
on mining at the northern end of the
Westralian Golden Mile has been dis-
covered by Dr. Larcombe on Block 45.
From a bore down 200 ft., dolerite, which
carries the main lode channels of the
Mile, was found for the last 30ft. To
date this is the furthest point north that
dolerite has been found. Development
alone will reveal the actual importance
of the discovery.

A wholesale resurrection of the dead
is taking place in the vicinity of Kooky-
nie and Niagara (W.A.). The grave of
the Cosmopolitan, a fair-sized producer
of 30 years ago, has been reopened, and
so have those of the Champion, Britannia
and Batavia. Boring is proceeding on
other old mines, and others again are
being equipped with treatment plants.
Settlement is increasing, the takings of
the pubs are expanding, and the Salva-
tion Army has arrived and started to look
for converts and cash.
* * * *
At Norseman (W.A.) Ruwolt’s have
been given the job of supplying and in-
stalling a new 5000-ton a month mill,
embodying all the latest improvements.
In the by-ways of the market there is
talk of the board accepting an offer made
by a group of speculators to underwrite
the remaining 25,000 of the co.’s unissued
shares at £2 each.
* * * >i=
Great Boulder’s August profit (£5956)
was the smallest' monthly surplus this
year. Heavy absorption of gold by the
new treatment plant is the explanation.
Better returns and a saving of 6s. a ton
in treatment costs are expected before
long.
sf: * * *
Great Fingall, Westralia’s once-famous
Murchison gold producer, is being tried
again. With luck the new operating co.
may get something in the shape of leav-
ings in the upper levels ; reopening of the
deeper workings would be an expensive
business.

Great Boulder Prop, came to light last
week with another discovery. Telluride,
assaying over a width of 7ft., has
shown up in a crosscut on the 700 ft.
level about 58ft. west of the east boun-
dary.
Slavin’s Block 8 Co., floated in Adel-
aide during the 1920 Hampton Plains
boom, has taken an option over a show
at Higginsville (W.A.). A. J. Macgeorge,
mining engineer, recommended it.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
E.H.J.: (1) Paid capital is £29,625 in 10s.
shares, of which 31,250 are fully-paid vendors'
shares, and the balance contribs. paid to
Is. 9d. (2) Price fluctuations, due largely to
bore results of Western Mining Corp., which
holds an option over this and adjoining proper-
ties. (3) At £26 it still looks like a reason-
ably good spec H.H.H.: See page 16 B.
25/4/’34 F.W.: (1) In the absence of special
circumstances, each department should bear its
proper proportion of exes. (2) It appears to,
and the auditor says so. The adjustment of
figures between departments would not affect
the final p. and 1. balance. (3) Yes.

ABRIDGED PROSPECTUS.
The Company has been incorporated for the purpose of acquiring as a going concern the
Glass-Manufacturing Business of Allied Glass Manufacturers Limited, and with the other
objects specified in its Memorandum of Association.
THE BUSINESS TO BE ACQUIRED.
In the organisation of Allied Glass Manufacturers Limited, there are a number of highly-
skilled Glass Workers and other operatives who are under definite Service Agreements, and
whose technical skill is adequate for the manufacture of the highest grades of Glassware,
including cut-glass of the highest quality. Further, many of these men have identified them-
from the same date the existing trade liabilities of the vendor Company.
The vendor Company’s factory is in full production, and orders for the Company’s
products greatly exceed the present capacity of the works at Alexandria, and reports received
from the Company’s selling staff show a ready and waiting market for the products of this
undertaking far beyond its present ability to supply.
ASSETS TO BE ACQUIRED.
The business and undertaking of Allied Glass Manufacturers Limited will be taken over
by the Corporation as a going concern as from the 30th day of September, 1934, and the
Corporation will have the benefit of all profits realised from that date, and will also assume
from the same date the existing trade liabilities of the vendor Company.
It is proposed to continue the undertaking without break or interruption upon the lines
which have proved so successful since the inauguration of the vendor Company, retaining
the services of the present management and staff, who have largely contributed to that
success.
The property to be transferred to the Corporation comprises, in addition to the goodwill
ol the business and the benefit of all orders, the whole of the assets (other than unpaid
capital) of the vendor Company, including the estate or interest of the vendor Company in the
land and works at Alexandria, buildings thereon, plant, machinery, tools and equipment,
book debts, manufactured stock on hand, cash in hand and at the Bank, the benefit of the
Options held by the vendor Company over:
(a) Freehold interest in the Alexandria land;
(b) Leasehold interest (held of the Victorian Railways Commissioners) in land and
buildings at Oakleigh, Melbourne;
(c) Freehold land and buildings at Nundah, Brisbane;
(d) Certain inventions and patent applications;
and also the benefit of all Service Contracts entered into with the vendor Company by the
principal technical staff, all of whom have consented to the proposed assignment of such
contracts.
THE SYDNEY WORKS.
The Works established by the vendor Company, and now to be acquired by the Corpora-
tion, are situate at the corner of O’Riordan Street and Godfrey Street, Alexandria, in the
heart of Sydney’s industrial area.
The area of the land is 4 acres 3 roods 32j) perches, and it is conveniently situated for
transport, being within a short distance of the main Botany Road.
The Directors of the vendor Company made an extensive search before finally deciding
upon the site of these Works, and satisfied themselves that the position was ideal for the
purposes of the undertaking. Labour is plentiful in the district, and the Works are within
easy reach of all important centres.
Considerable improvements have been made to the land —low-lying portions have been
filled in, roads and tracks have been made and levelled, new fences and gates have been
erected, and the whole site adapted to the purposes of the Corporation.
The land is held by. the Vendor Company on lease from City Mutual Life Assurance
Society, Limited, the Mortgagee in possession, for a term of 3 years from 21st May, 1934,
at the rental of £416 per annum, and the Company also holds a purchase option at approxi-
mately £5900 from the Official Liquidator, Australian Steel Foundries Limited (in liquida-
tion), the Mortgagor Company, which the Corporation can exercise later and so convert
into freehold.
According to a recent Valuation of the Valuer-General’s Department, the value of the
land on a freehold basis is placed by that Department at £9OOO.
FACTORY BUILDINGS.
The buildings erected upon the abovementioned site include: Main Shop, 108 feet long
and 90 feet wide, built of steel and timber girders, galvanised-iron roof and walls; engineers’
shop; mould-room; blacksmith’s shop, garages, works manager’s office —108 feet long and
20 feet wide, built of similar materials.
THE MELBOURNE WORKS SITE.
The Melbourne site, over which an option has been acquired by the vendor Company, is
situate at Oakleigh, in the Parish of Mulgrave, County of Bourke, being part of Crown
Portions Five and Eight. One portion of the land is nearly 1700 feet long by 142 feet wide,
and the adjoining portion is about 250 feet long by 252 feet.
The land is served by an excellent road, and is within a few minutes of the main Prince’s
Highway, seven miles from Melbourne.
There is a private railway siding, carrying with it special privileges from the Victorian
Railways Commissioners,
The land is held on lease from the Victorian Railways Commissioners for a term of 10
years and 8 calendar months from Ist January, 1934, at a rental of £225 per annum, with the
right to remove all buildings, etc., on the land at the expiration of the term.
There are two timber and galvanised-iron buildings on the site, eminently suitable to the
Company’s requirements.
THE BRISBANE WORKS SITE.
The location of the premises over which an option has been secured by the vendor
Company in the Brisbane area is situate adjoining the Nundah Railway Station, with a railway
siding included in the subject land, five miles from the Brisbane General Post Office by rail,
and between four and five miles by road (excellent bitumen road all the way). The land is
situate well above flood area, and there is a large timber and galvanised-iron structure on
the site, adequate for the Corporation’s requirements. The area of the land is 3 acres 1 rood
37 1-10th perches, and the property is freehold, the purchase price being the low figure
of £4500.
BUILDINGS, MACHINERY, PLANT, ETC
The new buildings, machinery, plant, and equipment at the Alexandria Works have been
carefully examined by Messrs. H. E. Ross and Rowe, Consulting Engineers, and have been
valued by them at the. sum of £14,976. .........
PATENT RIGHTS.
Included in the sale by the vendor. Company is the benefit of an Option by Laurence
Everard George Rochfort for the acquisition, on favorable terms, of certain inventions and
patent applications.
SAND.
There is also included in the sale an Option from Cement Mortars, Limited, to purchase
an area of 8 acres 1 rood 34} perches at Rosebery, containing deposits of sand, suitable lot
the requirements of the Company’s undertaking, at the price of £9OOO.
ORDERS.
The business in hand and in prospect at the date of this Prospectus is sufficient to absorb
the output of the Company’s Works for some time to come. Promises of support irom many
important users of glass bottles and other products to be manufactured by the Gampany have
been received conditionally on the Company being able to supply their wants. The profitable
nature of the Glass-manufacturing industry is well known to the investing public, and it is
confidently anticipated that the Corporation will secure a substantial share of the trade and
earn satisfactory profits on its issued capital.
CO-OPERATION WITH BELGIUM.
Negotiations are well advanced with a view to securing the co-operation of one of the
principal Glass-works in Belgium. The management of these works are prepared to send then
own Engineer-Specialist to Australia to go into ail questions of improvement in Glass-
manufacture, and to assist so far as may be required in the technical direction of the under-
taking, and the engaging of further technical staff, and are also prepared to collaborate finan-
cially with the Corporation if desired by the latter.
MANAGEMENT.
The Corporation has secured for a period of five years the services of Mr. John William
Mackerras as Managing Director. Mr. Mackerras holds a like position with the vendor
Company, and is mainly responsible for the progress made by that Company in the establish-
ment and development of its undertaking.
FINANCIAL.
The Corporation has an authorised share capital of £500,000, and, as previously stated, is
offering for subscription £200,000 in £1 ordinary shares.
This issue will provide ample capital for all requirements for the present, as the estimated
figures for completion of up-to-date Works in the three States, installation of additional plant,
machinery, and equipment, and for working capital are well provided for, leaving an ample
margin for contingencies.
The shareholders in the vendor Company have signified their faith in the future of the
Corporation by carrying unanimously a Special Resolution authorising their Directors to take
the necessary steps to sell the undertaking for a consideration IN THE FORM OF SHARPS
ONLY.
PROPOSED CAPITAL EXPENDITURE.
The proposed capital expenditure will include the following:
Purchase of freehold interest in land at Alexandria, cost of transfer, etc £6,000
Reconstruction of, and additions to, Works Buildings at Alexandria 5.000
Purchase of leasehold land and buildings at Oakleigh, Melbourne, with cost
of transfer, etc _ 2.100
Purchase of freehold land and buildings at Nundah, Brisbane, with cost of
transfer, etc 4.600
£17,700
Reconstruction of Works and installation of plant, etc., as per report 69,950
£87,650
and also in the payment of registration, legal and general formation expenses, and brokerage.
The balance of capital, as and when paid up, will be appropriated for working capital, adequate
for coping with the large volume of business offering which cannot at present be handled, and
for the development of Works in other States.
ESTIMATED PRODUCTION.
The present demand for the Company's products warrants an extension of its operations,
and the establishment of the proposed Works in Melbourne and in Brisbane will place the
Corporation in a favorable position for accepting the business offering, and will also greatly
reduce cost of production.
The full capacity of the Company’s proposed installation, based upon six machines, should
yield a production estimated at £431,000 per annum.
Assuming sales can be made to the extent of £160,000, this should yield a satisfactory
dividend to the shareholders, after making provision for all contingencies.
CONTRACTS.
SALE AGREEMENT: A draft Contract for the sale by Allied Glass Manufacturers
Limited and its Liquidator to Atlas Glass-Manufacturers Corporation Limited has been
prepared.
The first-mentioned Company has called the necessary meetings to carry resolutions to
reconstruct the Company by going into Voluntary Liquidation and authorising the appointed
Liquidator to enter into an agreement with Atlas Glass-Manufacturers Corporation Limited,
when incorporated, in the terms of this draft Agreement, under which up to 32,500 shares in
the last-mentioned Company may be allotted to the vendor Company credited as fully paid up.
SERVICE AGREEMENT: A draft Agreement covering the terms and conditions under
which Mr. John William Mackerras agrees to accept the appointment of Managing Director
of Atlas Glass-Manufacturers Corporation Limited has also been prepared.

Articles of Association of Atlas Glass-Manufacturers Corporation Limited may be inspected
at the office of the Solicitors to the Corporation, Messrs. Stephen, Jaques and Stephen, Bank
of New South Wales Building, George and Wynvard Streets, Sydney.

In Technicolor: “La Cucuracha”
Screened privately in Sydney last week
at the R.K.O. theatrette, this, the first
example of the Whitney technicolor pro-
cess to arrive in Australia, made an excel-
lent impression. It transfers to the screen
color-work equal to the very best stills
made with the latest color photography
processes and seems to suffer less than
those processes do from difficulties in
translating accurately certain shades.
The talkie “La Cucuracha” is in form
more a one-act opera than a play. The
setting is Mexican, the music Spanish-
American, and, as the plot deals with
singers and dancers, there is plenty ol:
vivid color. Some of the groupings make
gorgeously effective pictures, and, unlike
earlier attempts to show color on the
screen, there is no mottled or screeny
effect, no blurring or merging of
colors at the edges. Camera definition
is less flexible than in black-and-white
film photography, due, probably, to a
considerably longer focal length, and
when near and distant objects are de-
lineated one plane is slightly out of: focus.
This limitation, however, is never allowed
to detract from the effect, which is so
delightful that the monochrome films
seem insipid in comparison.
“General John Regan”
At the Lyceum. This talkie version of
one of George A. Birmingham’s novels
is peopled with true-to-life Irish char-
ters and interspersed with many charm-
ing glimpses of the Irish countryside. As
the doctor Henry Edwards is excellent
throughout. So are W. G. Fay as the
•editor, Fred O’Donovan as a publican,
and John Traynor as a priest. Pegeen
Mair is also well in the picture.
“Sorrell and Son”
The talkie is much more restrained
than was the silent film based on the
same story. H. B. Warner furnishes a
capital study of the self-sacrificing Capt.
Sorrell. His return from the war to find
that only menial employment is open
to him and his progress from one under-
paid job to another are well depicted.
Warner’s ability to remedy by fine acting
some obvious blunders on the part of the
producer is a feature of the film. But Sor-
rell’s adoration of his son is apt to be-
come wearisome, and the long-drawn-out
end gets on the nerves. Wally Patch
makes a first-rate bully as the head
porter at the second pub at which Sor-
rell works. Hugh Williams is well cast
as Sorrell, junior, and Peter Penrose as
the same person when a child. Ruby
Miller contributes a clear-cut study as
the public-house lady who had designs
on the elder Sorrell, and Margaret
Grahame strikes the right note as the
selfish wife.
“Police Car 17”
’ A gangster film—all about a master
criminal (Edwin Maxwell) who is also a
master of disguise; a kidnapped police
captain (Wallis Clark) who, with his
beauteous daughter (Evalyn Knapp) is
about to be shot in cold blood ; and a
young cop (Tim McCoy) who rushes to
the rescue and wins the charming goil.
Action is brisk, interest is well-sustained
and the policemen are convincing. The
value of radio communication with
police cars is strongly featured. At Syd-
ney Capitol.
“A Modern Hero’ 1
One of those Cavalcadish productions,
ranging from 1900 to present date. The
central figure (Richard Barthelmess) is
a circus rider, illegitimate son of a great
European banker. He has ambition
and money-making ability. Breaking
away from the circus he sets up as a
bicycle repairer; becomes one of the
pioneer automobile manufacturers;
makes a fortune as a munitions con-
tractor in war-time, and loses the lot
through a dishonest Wall-street broker.
In his circus days he loved a girl (Jean
Muir) who refused his offer to make an
honest woman of her. He has other love
affairs, but his only real affection is for
his illegitimate son. The young man is
killed in the automobile his father in-
sisted on giving him. At last this
modern hero goes back to his mother, an
ex-circus lady, addicted to drink. She
tells him to rise again and reconquer the
world, having learned what is worth hav-
ing in life and what is worthless. Bar-
thelmess fits his role badly and fails to
win sympathy, but Marjorie Rambeau’s
picture of the dissolute old woman of
the circus is good.
“The Affairs of a Gentleman”
At Sydney Plaza. A murder story
which provides a corpse without any
waste of time. The deceased (Paul
Lukas) was a popular writer of sex novels
and a persistent woman-hunter. Plenty
of people had good reasons for sending
him to an early grave had they chosen.
Although his death appeared to be a case
of suicide a preternaturally acute detec-
tive forms a theory of murder and sets
out to prove it. The result is confusing
and unconvincing.
“Moulin Rouge”
Yet another back-stager, made up of
threadbare situations, but played with in-
fective gaiety. Con-
stance Bennett is
the stage - crazy
wife of a writer of
musical plays
(Franchot Tone).
Mr. Tone says she
can’t act for nuts
and forbids her ap-
pearance. His pro-
ducer (Tullie Car-
minati) thinks
otherwise, and
gives- the lady all
possible encourage-
ment. From France
comes a much-
boomed music-hall
star, engaged to
give lustre to one
of Mr. Tone’s
shows. When Miss
Bennett meets her
she recognises a
partner in an early
theatrical venture.
The French actress
(she is actually a
100 per cent.
American) is bored
with the stage, and
readily consents to
Miss Bennett’s plan
to impersonate her.
The deception is
highly successful.
Messrs. Tone and
Carminati both fall
violently in love
with the supposedly
imported star, and
so on, according to
formula.
Miss Bennett fulfils all demands made
upon her, and the two men are well cast.
There are some catchy songs and heaps
of shapely chorines.
“Fugitive Lovers”
The chain of express-train films has
apparently petered out, but the wave of
long-distance ’bus pictures which started
with “Friday, the 13th” is still flowing
strongly. The latest is “Fugitive Lovers”
at Sydney St. James.
Madge Evans, a chorus girl, leaves
New York for Hollywood in the trans-
continental ’bus to get away from gang-
ster Nat Pendleton. He follows. A
gaol breakaway enables Robert Mont-
gomery also to be a passenger, and,
naturally, seated beside Madge. The
passengers are of varied and amusing
types, an amiable drunkard taking the
leading minor role*
The whole State constabulary is out
after Montgomery. Madge has only the
gangster to worry about at first, but the
detectives are soon after her, too. A
blizzard causes a hold-up of all traffic,
but the two fugitives make off in- the
vehicle, closely pursued. The- saving
of a char-a-banc load of children from
death in the snow provides an excuse
for a free pardon and a happy ending.
An unconvincing business.
Sundry Shows.
If the grand-opera boom which started
in Melbourne on Saturday night con-
tinues at the same furious tempo there is
a grave possibility that the Apollo will
burst. Not only were the foyers in the
intervals and the auditorium during the
acts in danger of suffering this fate, but
the choruses of priests, priestesses, Minis-
ters of the Crown, captains of the E.1.F.,
members of the Egyptian Board of Works
and other bodies, slaves, Ethiopian pris-
oners, Egyptian patriots and sundries
which filed on to the Apollo’s somewhat
diminutive stage taxed the accommoda-
tion to such an extent that some of the
pomp and magnificence which the Firm
on other occasions has succeeded in
including on the larger expanse of His
Majesty’s had to be left out.
Only a skeleton force was allowed
to participate in Rhadames’ triumph
on his return from the wars. More-
over, the ancient Egyptian orchestra blow-
ing modern band instruments which was
an engaging feature of J.C.W. operanto-
mime had to be omitted, though with-
out noticeable" diminution in the volume

of sound. For the 47 Australian instru-
mentalists in the pit, with Stanilaus de
Tarcynzski as first violin and under the
impulsion of the baton held in the hand
of the small, eager maestro Maurice de
Abravanel, were up to their job.
By the end of the second act the pro-
duction was seen to be well on it's way to
success. The singing of the play in Eng-
lish was a blessing in disguise, and non-
Italianate listeners, for the first time in
their lives, awoke to the fact that, if the
sense of opera is often the nonsense of
real life, it can also often add to the emo-
tional quality of a scene, as when Flor-
ence Austral, badly done up, as is usual,
for the part of the Ethiopian slave,
melodiously argued the point with Muriel
Amneris Brunskill as to which should
monopolise Rhadames. Amneris, tall,
haughty, princessly and superior, whis-
pered and shouted her hate in a rich
and voluptuous voice, while Aida Austral
brought her intelligence and her finished
vocal organ to bear on the plaintive and
passionate statement of her case, the
wrangle ending,in such a> succession, of
encores that the principals had very little
time to change for their appearance qt
the Gate of Thebes. Walter Widdop’s
Rhadames was short and dark and extra-
ordinarily like that of Francesco Merli in
1928, and his tenor was adequate to the
needs of “Celeste Aida” ; but he lacked
the Merli intensity except in the mor-
tuary scene in the last act. Appleton
Moore’s Ethiopian king was short of a
note or two that John Brownlee might
have given him, but made up for the lack
in the sincerity of his kingly fury in the
liberation scene. Nothing in the perform-
ance was so musically good as his sancti-
fication to the service of Mars in the
Temple of Vulcan, where the imposition
of solo singing on the thrilling chorus of
the girls and priests was beautifully con-
trolled. Norman Allin’s high priest Ram-
phis resembled Umberto di Lelio’s as one
centenary lolly stick resembles another,
while being considerably more dignified ;
and his voice was rich with the juices of
ecclesiastical lust for blood when he de-
manded Rhadames’ life.
The chief merit of the piece is that it
was Verdi’s first attempt to achieve a
Wagnerian balance between singers and
orchestra, and he succeeded more or less,
except where he succumbed to the temp-
tation to be spectacular. By the time these
remarks have seen print the Fuller com-
bination will have settled down to its job.
Lieutenant Pinkerton was billed to call
for a “whisky-soda” on Monday, “Trova-
tore” was to make its appearance on
Tuesday and Austral will bury the carv-
ing-knife in Scarpia’s fell breast on
Friday night.
H- H- H-
“Sixteen,” which opened at Sydney
Cri. on Saturday night, is by those
specialists in domestic detail Aimee and
Philip Stuart, and presents a natural-
enough picture of a household that con-
sists of widow, two young daughters,
grandma and cook. Only visitors are
eminent lawyer, who is to marry’ widow,
and family doctor. Elder daughter
fiercely resents the idea of her mother’s
remarriage, and after she has attempted
suicide she has to be told by family
doctor that her papa wasn’t exactly an
angel. That is the whole material of
the play, and the work of the small cast
of players is cut out to keep the audi-
ence interested. Act I was occupied
mostly with the lengthy ovations with
which Sydney first-nighters greet every
entrant on the stage. These disjoint the
action, if there is any action, and smother
the dialogue, but in plays like “Sixteen”
which have neither beginning, middle nor
end, and live by small-talk, that doesn’t
very much matter.
The players were very much more in-
teresting than the play. Sydney Bush,
who had the thankless role of the 16-
year-old miss full of tantrums —the
pathological and psychological reasons
for which are fully discussed —was mak-
ing her debut as a professional; very
nervous and mechanical in the first
act, but adequate in the second and
third. Isabelle Mahon, another youngster
just beginning to climb the ladder, has
all the comedy of this “comedy-drama”
as a 14-year-old with a prodigious
appetite and an ineradicably cheer-
ful outlook on life. She will be
fortunate if she ever again gets such a
colorless background against which to
scintillate, but even so she shows
promise, Emma Temple, as the grand-
mother, and Katie Towers, as the cook,
are mummers with whom the stage is an
old, old story, and they get the last
ounce out of subsidiary parts. Jane Wood
has little scope for her talents as a tra-
gedienne in the role of the widow;
Harvey Adams is as smooth and as com-
petent as ever in the part of a titled
K.C., and Kenneth Brampton’s elderly
doctor is so true to type that the B.M.A.
ought to have his characterisation em-
balmed or otherwise preserved and pre-
sented to the British Museum for the
edification of future generations.
Stage settings, by George Upward, are
admirable. The perfection with which
they enshrine the dressing (and undress-
ing, of which there’s a lot) is a tribute to
the eye for color of producer S. A.
Locke.

Radio Politicians
The radio means “finish” for the
present type of politician. In the Com-
monwealth election candidates admitted
themselves at a loss. Where were the
street-corner crowds of yesteryear? At
home listening-in, and the candidate
couldn’t be sure that they were listening
to him. No rowdy meetings, no inter-
jectors ; except for hoardings and letter-
boxes and a daily press stuffed with un-
read tripe, the average man paid little
attention to any of it.
The radio means the end of the ranter
and his appeal to the mob. You can’t
sway a crowd when it’s scattered in a
million homes and can obliterate you
with a twist of a finger the moment you
bore or displease. I foresee a new race
of politicians with cultured voices, and
party managers seeking candidates with a
mike personality.—O. D. (N.S.W.).
Poisoning No Offence
There is a fumigator on the Sydney
premises in which I live, and it is worse
than a nuisance. It has spoilt food, made
members of my family ill and killed
three canaries. It was the death of the
three birds which enabled us to trace the
trouble to its source. I complained to
the City Council, to the Public Health
authorities and to the police. The last-
named wrote: —.
Inquiries show that precautions were
taken to prevent the escape of poisonous
gas The incident is' being brought under
the notice of the Public Health authori;
ties for consideration as to whether legis-
lation should be introduced.
So the position is that any person with
a fumigator can release deadly gases with
impunity, provided he takes inadequate
precautions. Neither the police nor the
municipal authorities can interfere, nor
can any Government department. Pos-
sibly the only right of redress is what
one’s executors might have after one has
been poisoned. — King’s Cross (N.S.W.).
On “Rationed! Relief Work”
Perhaps because I am one of the
N.S.W. unemployed I found “El Ver-
dugo’s” comparisons distasteful (B.
19/9/’34). Those black ladies approach-
ing their time who earn only two or
three shillings a day! How much does
“El Verdugo” think we earn? For
“rationed relief work” I get 4s. 5d. a day,
£3 2s. 4d. a fortnight—the full allow-
ance under my schedule. I have to keep

If “El V.” can show me how anyone
can live, year in year out, on the money
from rationed relief work, without hav-
ing recourse to “the bounty of tfve land-
lord,” I would be grateful. I can’t do

I have a military pension of 10s. a week
in addition. After apportioning my fort-
nightly £3 2s. 4d. I have 4s. 6d. left.

Adolf, Benito —and Norman
For eight years The Bulletin has
chased us up in odd spots of the globe.
As I write we are p.gs. in a very pleasant
South German home, and great was. my
satisfaction when a bundle of Bulletins
came to hand. Our host, of ample pro-
portions, drew near and smilingly ob-
served, “Ah so! It gives you great
pleasure to get your Zeitung, nicht ?”
At the same time an Italian professor,
of slim proportions and magnificent
eyes, approached on t’other side. I be-
gan to praise The Bulletin, and —alas!
—Norman Lindsay, and then opened
the paper.
The Italian gazed in horror on Lind-
say’s fine portrayal of Mussolini
(27/6/’34). The German extended a pet-
rified finger at the counterfeit present-
ment of Hitler. “Scharlie Schaplin,” he
hissed —“mein Gott!” Picture the scene.

The Transport Tyranny
The members (300) of the Sydney
Motor-van Owners’ Association propose
to have a picnic in October. It sounds
easy; but there is a Transport Depart-
ment to reckon with, and there is a
colossal annual deficit on Government
transport. Naturally, each of the 300
would like to take his family to the
picnic in his own caravan. “Permit for
vehicle” costs a shilling. But the depart-
ment will not accept a mass application
for permits. If each of the 300 calls per-
sonally he may get “sympathetic con-
sideration,” though hints have been
dropped that the department does not
consider some of the vans suitable for
the conveyance of passengers.
There is an alternative, calculated to
reduce the enormous losses on Govern-
ment transport. The van-owners have
been offered a special train —Govern-
ment, of course —to Canley Vale, 19
miles, for £2OO plus fares —3000, per-
haps. On arrival at the station, there
will be another £75 for the hire of 10
Government ’buses to take the party 2}
miles to the picnic ground.
The new tyranny set up in Australia
is deficient in many things ; but it doesn't
lack nerve. —“El V.” (N.S.W.).
Youth’s Chances
Your criticism of State secondary edu-
cation (B. 12/9/’34) is much to the point.
About a generation ago several Austra-
lian directors of education went off on
pilgrimages. Their adoration of all that
was done abroad, under conditions
general and financial which were not
faintly reproduced in Australia, was
translated into action on their return ; and
to their inability to see that Australia
was not Scotland, Germany and America
we owe an enormous debt of educational
futility that will never be liquidated, as
well as the diversion of tens of thou-
sands of young people from their natural
avenues of occupation.
Australia has not advanced sufficiently
even now to afford indiscriminate free
high schools, and the effort to spread a
thin veneer of secondary education over
her vast continent has meant starvation
of the primary system with its teachers,
and totally inadequate provision for the
practical training of the huge numbers
that should pass into rural and artisan
employment, with some useful founda-
tion for what they are going to do.
In the boom years, when the wages of
unskilled labor had been forced up to a
ridiculous height, small farmers and
others who could no longer afford to
employ it migrated to the cities to be-
come wharfies, storemen, packers and the
like, and to send their children to the
free high schools —from which they
emerged with the laudable ambition to
parade city streets in their store clothes
and carry little brief bags. Hence our
vast quantity of scribes, agents, middle-
men and sellers-of-anything-at-all pos-
sessing no specific skill—when depression
comes the first to be put off the job
and on to the dole for the skilled and
competent to support.
When the paralysing hand of the sub-
ject specialist is barred from its mis-
chievous work, and education is seen as
a whole vital process related to the
world’s business and not viewed in little
fragments, youth will have more chance
of selecting the job.
When the people of Australia cease to
crowd into the capital cities to prey on 1
one another, when the proportion of
female labor in industry and commerce
is reduced to what it ought to be and
no more, then will young males cease
shivering in the cold of unemployment,
and have a chance to choose the job in-
stead of regarding it' as “a prize in a
lottery.”—S. R. D. (Vic.).
Brisbane “Grammar”
T hate to break a pen-nib with an old
school cobber, but “El V.” (B. 5/9/’34)
claims virtues for the Brisbane Gram-
mar School which in my time it did not
possess. I was there during ’99 and
1900. I left with a smattering of several
things and a fairly sound grounding in
the three R’s —gained at Government
schools before going to “Grammar.”
Attending “Grammar” in those days
made of the boys a race of little snobs.
We didn’t mix with State schools in sport
or in general competitions. As beings of
superior clay, we joined in the feu cle
foie at the Lytton encampment—which
was denied State cadets. We lined the
streets at public processions. We had
torches given us on Mafeking night. The
State cadets were unarmed. With the aid
of those sticks, and the tar with with
they were bedaubed, we yarded a mob
of State boys on the little island in the
Gardens. Oh, yes, we were little gentle-
men!
If a boy had industry or ability, or
both, he got individual tuition —the same
as he got in the old Normal State, then
the biggest school in Queensland. If the
pupil was like myself he got nothing the
State school did not offer him.
Proficiency in sport, is it? Occasion-
ally old Jimmy Cowan would stroll down
to the pitch and bowl a few balls
with one hand, then with the other.
That was the cricket coaching. I never
heard of a football coach. We won the
Meath prize for rifle-shooting—admitted.
If there was any coaching for that it was
kept secret, and the general run of
scholars did not even know the thing was
in competition until the tortoise-shell
crescent pendant from silver bullets
appeared and old “Reggie” Roe made a
speech.
Grammar School had a good record in
Rhodes scholars when it had a practical
monopoly of secondary education. Its
tradition, at which “El V.” hints, hung
on a few big names —J. T. Byrne lead-
ing. I have seen Old Boys humping their
swags.
“El V.” need not worry about the
flooding of classrooms bringing a lower
standard of education. The fellow who
rises to the top will receive individual
tuition, be the class one of half a dozen
or one of 200. I was always one of the
mob. I don’t blame the masters for
that; I’d do the same thing myself were
I in their places. B.G.S. was a fine old
place and I love my memories of it.
But I don’t blind those memories with
haloes of romance and false facts as “El
V.” has done. —N. S. L. (N.Q.).


ABORIGINALITIES
“Top-rail”: Somewhere up in the cold
brick chimney came a clucking sound.
] peered up the flue but could see no-
thing. I shook the iron stovepipe ; there
came the scolding of an angry bird, but
nothing was visible. I removed the stove-
pipe. A load of soot rained down upon
me, and a bird with wings as black as
night flew forth and circled round the
kitchen. It upset the lamp, broke some
crockery and eventually settled on top
of the pantry. I caught it. It then burst
into loud peals of hysterical laughter, and
the more it laughed the more soot it
shook from its feathers. Released, the
young kookaburra flew to the nearest
tree and told some other kookas about
it. While I was trying to clean out the
soot and broken crockery from the
kitchen I heard a chorus of ribald laugh-
ter from outside.
“Turn Turn” (Solomon Is.): I’ve never
read such tommyrot as Aboliars have
written about fish swallowing live bait
head first. During the years I’ve fished
in the Solomons and caught hundreds
of many different kinds, I’ve never yet
“Not bin light fire yet, and me bin slaving all day with the housework!”
known a bait (live or dead) to be swal-
lowed any other way than tail first. I’ve
used anything from a piece of white
calico to patent spinners which have cost
me 13s. each —and may the Lord have
mercy on the souls of the retailers who
charge it! Many fish on being opened
were found to have another inside in a
more or less digested state; in every
single instance has this smaller fish been
swallowed tail first. How anyone can
expect a fish chasing another to swallow
it head first is beyond me.

“Timothy Tywire”: Just how fast
can a bushfire travel? “S.G.” (B.
5/9/’34) mentions one travelling “six
miles in as many minutes.” Wind can
certainly attain a velocity greatly in excess
of 60 miles an hour, but from what 1
have seen of bushfires I reckon that to
have a fire travelling at a mile a minute
you’d need a wind considerably faster ;
and such winds must be very rare in
n.-w. Q. Flames on the face of a bush-
fire don’t drive steadily forward, no
matter how strong the following wind ;
every few minutes they are checked
momentarily and surge upwards, a
phenomenon caused presumably by the
sudden and violent displacement of air
they occasion.
* * * *
“Herpeton”: The advice given by
“Worro” (B. 19/9/’34) not to pull a half-
swallowed snake out of a bird’s throat,
since the “scales” must
injure the bird, falls
flat. A snake has no
scales, the corrugations
on his covering being
merely folds in an ordi-
nary skin, much like
those which furrowed
the expansive brow of
J. T. Lang on Sunday
morning, September 16.
To drag a half-eaten
meal out of the eater’s
stomach by force needs
no scale effect to make
it dangerous to the
patient. I’ll guarantee
if “Worro” had half a
yard of sausage down
his neck and someone
seized the other half and yanked the lot
out he would be in as bad a plight as
the bird he sings about —and sausages
have no scales.
* * * *
“Huon”: No wonder “Bogaduck” (B.
26/9/’34) was badly received when he
paid his visit to a bull seal Li the midst
of his harem in the breeding season. Far
be it from me to suggest it, but, suppose
“Bogaduck” were the husband of many
wives, how would he like the intrusion
of a mob of strangers at a moment when
there were 15 doctors’ bills on the file
and evidence that more would arrive?
Have a heart, “Bogaduck,” have a heart!
* * * *
“C. Coral”: That mysterious sea-
animal up Bowen (N.Q.) way which
threatens to rival the Loch Ness mon-
ster may have been a giant Luth turtle.
The back has ridges corresponding to
the fishermen’s description, and a speci-
men caught by Torres Strait islanders
some years ago was too large to be
swung on to a lugger. There is also an
outsize shark which grows up to about
50ft. in length, described by the islanders
as having “eyes all same saucepan-lid
and long whiskers underneath mouth” ;
it is believed to belong to the basking
variety.
* $ * *
“Pick”: Resistance and strength of
gum-tree roots at times make even bush-
men wonder. Near the bank of a big
washaway in Garland Gully (N.S.W.)
there’s a healthily-growing ribbon-gum.
Constant erosion during the past win-

ter’s floods tore away the soil till a 20-ton
granite boulder was left suspended
among the roots. The swing of the huge
gibber twisted the slender lateral root-
lets into a stout hawser, but over the
surface spread a network of tendrils, the
largest no more than half an inch thick ;
they held the granite mass swinging 30ft.
in mid-air.

“Wakatipu”: Before the open season
for monsters comes to an end I’d like
to hand on a M.L.
deep-sea fisher-
man’s explanation
of the taniwha,
which, so a Maori
legend has it, was
wont to disport
itself off the North
Island coast, My
authority thinks
the Maoris did see
something more
tangible than the
filmy offspring of
imagination and
superstition, and is
convinced that it
was a swordfish,
plus a shoal of
trevalli. The tre-
valli are a luxury
dish for the swordie,
who gets so excited
when he sights a
school that he
often jumps right
out of the sea in
the effort to spear
them from below.
Naturally the tre-
valli also get agi-
tated, and they,
too, sometimes
shoot out of the
water, more often
than not in small
shoals or groups.
The general effect
from a distance is
not unlike the
popular conception
of a sea - serpent
travelling along near the surface with its
back arched in several places.
*** • *
‘'Omega”: A swordfish 15ft. long
by sft. wide, the possessor of a sft.
sword, became entangled in a set fishing
net owned by E. Everson at Chinderah
(Tweed River, N.S.W.). The fisherman
was away from home at the time, and
his wife tried to drag the net in. Five
men eventually hoisted the monster to the
branch of a tree with a block and tackle.
Then an axe was used to slay it.
* * * *
“Mako”: Maoriland likewise can
show great collections of ancient shells
(B. 12/9/’34), both cockles and pipi, but,
curiously, the M.L. collections are mostly
found on the tops of hills or even
high mountains. They were once
thought to be remains of old 'Maori
carousals; investigation suggested that
a more energetic people than the Maoris
had elected to feast on mountaintops and
drag their provender up with them. Pos-
sibly even an earlier race than the
Moriori.
* * *
“Crescendo”: Down Rangiriri (M.L.)
way two men observed in a neighboring
lake a black swan stern-up and sta-
tionary. They rowed out to investigate.
A large eel had swallowed the neck por-
tion of the bird and had choked.
* * * *
“Ex-'Rooer”: The par. about the cater-
pillar which becomes the fungus root
(B. 15/8/’34) reminds me of the natural
dew-ponds I saw in West Kimberley
(W.A.). The largest were at Mt. Wynne
—about 3ft. high and from 2ft. to 3ft.
across. They were somewhat oval in
shape, and always full to the brim with
beautifully clear water, yet never ran
over. They are really a growth com-
posed of strong, root-like fibre. I always
found a bone, mostly the hip- or leg-
bone of a kangaroo, at the bottom, from
which the growth seemed to have started.
When the waterbag was getting low
these reservoirs of cold water were a
welcome sight.

“C.Q.”: The death of A. C. Minchin,
director of the Adelaide Zoo, reminds
me that one of my vividest childhood
memories was of the polar bearskin rugs,
tiger- and leopard-skins with bristling
jaws, antlered deer’s heads and other
rare and costly pelts and relics with
which our house was decorated, and
which gleamed and grinned in every
corner. In the backyard were a live
Malayan turtle, brilliant tropic birds and
other exotic creatures not usually to be
found in Adelaide suburban gardens,
which seldom went beyond white mice,
cockatoos and pigeons ; yet my father
had never been outside South Australia,
and had never shot anything larger than
a sparrow. Another thing old inhabi-
tants may remember is that 40 years ago
Minchin’s annual report was not only a
faithful record of his stewardship, but
such good literature that the dailies
printed it in full. The explanation is that
my father, who was a journalist, was not
only a picturesque writer but an amateur
zoologist, and took an intense interest
in Minchin’s menagerie. It was he who
cast Minchin’s reports in artistic mould,
and, by way of grateful recognition,
when an animal died the director
would often send along the earthly in-
tegument to my father, beautifully pre-
served. Minchin succeeded his father,
who was the Zoo’s first director.
THE HOPE-BRINGER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You say you worked that old mine out, but
such is not the case;
There’s ore that “should give rich returns” in
nearly every face,
A lode (or “lode material”) that’s leaped to life
where you
Could only light on stuff that went a penny-
weight or two.
You tell me lhat the values dropped to where
they couldn’t pay:
But mining methods have improved since you
were in the play,
And though the vendors’ “expert” spends a lot
of time in town,
He opens old mines up where you could only
dose them down.
It may be that the proper explanation’s to be
found
In some mysterious growth of gold since you
were underground,
But this J know from his report—you know
it, too, old man—
You couldn’t find the values and the vendors'
“expert” can.
He brings new life where all was dead in
winze and rise and slope;
1 o buyers and to sellers both he brings new
bursts of hope.
And even though there may be times when he
may make a slip,
Well, after all, there’s nobody compelled to
buy the scrip.

“Airline”: I met him at a soak west
of the Musgraves—a lean, sunbaked
cameleer. His business? Well, it was
a trifle varied, but things could have been
a lot worse. Armed with the most
authoritative works on desert flora and
fauna, he was kept tolerably busy attend-
ing to the wants of various seats of
learning down below. A rare bird here,
a collection of desert shrubs there, per-
haps an urgent call for aboriginal
remains (“Be sure you don’t miss any of
the smaller bones !”)and the collecting and
preserving of the rarer mammalia of the
desert kept him occupied most of the
time. At night acetylene flares illu-
minated his camp, and winged hordes
came from near and far, to be pinned
neatly on to cards and sold at highly
remunerative rates. His knowledge of
the desert being invaluable to students
of the various sciences, his services were
eagerly sought at vacation time. Dog-
ging kept him going during the slack
periods.

“Coolabah”: The grass-tree seen by
“Mugshut” (B. 12/9/’34) was a full-
grown bush; it grew to a size and
then stopped. Owing to bushfires
and poor soil conditions the grass-
tree is invariably stunted, and while it
goes on shedding its under leaves it grows
neither taller nor more rotund.
“Canopus”: The grass-tree probably
takes upwards of 1000 years to get big
enough to receive the franchise. I’ve
never known anyone own up to sighting
a young tree. The burrawang is another
slow-grower. Full size, the bulb is a

for 12 years saw one expand from pea-

years.

light the fuse and run for your life, lhe
concussion will shatter the nest and

“Xover”: A near-by Vic. turkey farm
harbors a unique bird-cat partnership.
The household tabby selected lor hei
accouchement a corner of a broody tur-
key’s sitting box. Neither resents the
other’s presence; indeed every time
puss leaves to obtain nourishment out
goes the turkey’s wing to cover and
caress the five sightless mewlings. On
tabby’s return she just as readily resigns.
“Marsupial”: This stuff about the
plain-turkey and the pademelon being
wiped out makes me think fel-
lows get their evidence from
morning papers. That paddy
bloke is about the size of a
cross between a kangaroo-rat
and a scrub-wallaby. He’s a
shade darker in color than the
rat, and always has a dark cross
on his back —something in the
nature of a mule-stripe down his
backbone and across his shoul-
ders. When going he leans for-
ward, and always has one hand
across his breast, with the other
stuck out like a man feeling his
way in the dark. There are
odd ones in scrubs in the Char-
ters Towers (N.Q.) district, and

of paddies being thick anywhere.
“Sa Tiko”: Let “Austral” (B.

tic cat will eat the native mouse. Tom
would rather have a native mouse than a
fillet of whiting. The dead mouse which
“Austral” handed the cat was, of course.
tabu. Tom wouldn’t on any account
eat a mouse he hadn’t killed himself.
Cold bullamakau is acceptable, but with
natural food a cat insists on the warmth
of live blood always. *
“Petrolitis” : As evidence of the
destructive power of the motor let’s
take the township of Euraberrie, 28 miles
west of Longreach, on the road to
Winton. When first this place started W.
McMillan, the then owner of Maneroo,
referred to it disgustedly as “Dead
Finish.” After a bit the place was called
the Maneroo Pubs. As the late W. McM.
objected to the name of his station being
used in that way, the post office changed
it to Euraberrie. It was an important
mail change in those days for Cobb and
Co. It had two pubs, a store, a black-
smith’s shop, a heap of empty bottles,
a flock of goats, and some of the
finest girls in W.Q. Also, what old-
timer doesn’t remember Charlie Larkins
or Harry Davies? Or the race meetings,
the dances, the sing-songs, the high jam-
borees and the time the blackboy was
put up the lamp-post and wasn’t game
to come down for two days? All those
are gone. The motor came. It wasn’t
worth stopping at Euraberrie with the
engine just getting warmed to its job;
there was nothing to induce a night-
camp there. Trade fell off. One pub
shut. The other closed its doors. The
blacksmith’s shop and the store gave it
“’E’s out, I tell yer. If yer don't b'lieve me, come an look for yerself!”
a go. Now all that is left of the gay
days and the wild nights are a few
memories and a rubbish-heap which
marks what was once a rising little
township, killed by cars and the craze
for speed.

“Cuchulain”: Touching the acute
sight of the abo. (B. 6/9/’34), Binghi
anticipated the white doctors who pre-
scribe “eye exercises.” Out with a
black, you’ll notice his eyes are never
still: they roll round like an eternal
searchlight. Where we fix our eyes on
each object, Jacky knows it is there with
hardly a glance. Have ridden along with
black boys whose noses seemed eter-
nally in the air and tried to trip them
with objects seen scarcely by the way.
I never did. They never miss anything
—and with trained eyes no wonder they
can see when they do concentrate!
* =i= *
“Raspberry”: Doubt that yarn of
“Mac Binghi” (B. 19/9/’34) about those
cockatoos which stayed in one tree until
after dark and were gone when he looked
an hour or two later. There are some
night-using parrots. We have a rare
one in Australia, and M.L. has two, one
of which is a flightless burrower. With
these and other occasional exceptions,
including, of course, the night-birds
proper, it is safe to say that nothing will
shift a bird from its perch after dark
except actual physical interference. The
white cocky is no exception. I have
seen him go to bed in thousands in the
gums along the Balonne River (Q.) at sun-
down. When darkness fell and the shout-
ing and the tumult was over the birds
slept the night through.

“Huon”: What about this for a queer
accident? A sawmiller near Launceston
(Tas.) partly split a huge log with ex-
plosive to prepare it for the bench. A
jack was then inserted in the crack and
gradually extended the split, the jack, of
course, being under tremendous pressure
from the gaping walls of the splitting
log. Reginald Garwood was on top of
the log examining the jack. Suddenly
he fell into the gaping crack, and the
movement released the jack. The sides
of the log snapped together, and the poor
fellow was flattened between the closing
slabs. One has to go back to classical
times and the story of Milo to equal this
ghastly little tragedy.

“Brace and Bit”: The fact that a few
emaciated Chinamen drifted down the
Georgina (B. 29/8/’34) doesn’t dis-
prove my statement that the main stream
of smuggled Chows into Q. was from
Austral Downs, up Gidyea Creek to the
Cloncurry Ranges. As “El V.” is so
strong on history, let me tell him Urqu-
hart was never commander-in-chief of
the native police. He got no higher
in that corps than junior sub-inspector
in charge of a camp, and there were
at least three officers senior to him when
the body was absorbed in the ordinary
police of Q. Will “El V.” tell me when
there was a camp at Urandangie, and
where is the fort they built? Mossman
had a camp at Moonah Creek, about 40
miles east of the ’Dangie, and the place
bears his name to this day. There is
another fort-like barracks —or the re-
mains of it —on the Wills, about 30 miles
north of Boulia. And you can see rem-
nants of what may have been an old
police camp at Von Steiglitz, midway
between Roxborough and Carandotta.
The only thing resembling a fort at the
’Dangle, which may have misled “El
V.,” is one of Johnny-Cake Miller’s old
goatyards.

“Tuku”: “Elver’s” contention (B.
29/8/’34) that “glow-worms are really
beetles” wouldn’t go down with old
hands in Maoriland. I’ve seen huge
eels caught on bobs made from glow-
worms. Dug from the earth, threaded
on coarse twine and bunched into a
“bob,” the creatures exude a slimy sub-
stance that glows like phosphorus at
night and attracts eels from near and far.
I’ve had a slimy 3ft. wriggler wrapped
round my neck by an expert fishing with
a glow-worm bob. Let me say, too, that
I’ve seen these glow-worms dug up in
the M.L. bush nearly 3ft. long. And
that’s a fact!
“Doug”: What “Airline” was referring
to was a large variety of the common
worm found in damp country and
known to Maoriland farmers as the
“glow-worm” on account of its faintly
phosphorescent appearance at night. The
best way to catch eels is to put a sack
with a bullock’s liver in it in a stream
at night, shine a torch on it, and yank
out the eels with an unbarbed gaff. 1
suppose it’s a waste of time to tell any
Aboliar that a cobber and I caught 43
that way one night in a creek at Waver-
ley (M.L.). The light of the torch seems
to have the same attraction as the worms’
glow.

or Jack Moses first immortalised that
Gundagai dog in song I don’t know.
But I do know that in 1888 our old
gardener used to sing about it as he hoed
the cabbages. One couplet sticks in my
memory:
And we camped at Sugar O'Brien’s crick,
Nine mile from Gundagai.

“Cam Cove”: “Erne” (B. 5/9/’34) is
right when he says the Australian eagle
(popular misnomer “eagle-hawk”) does
not chase its dinner. Taking a long view
from the. sky, the eagle selects the joint
and then comes down in a hurry. If the
prey is on the wing, it comes to earth
and waits for the eagle ; if it is on the
ground, general paralysis sets in, and it
crouches limply until picked up. In the
case of a rabbit, the furry animal sets up
a squeal when it sees the eagle coming,
but doesn’t attempt to escape. Bunny
may be at the mouth of his burrow, and
merely to roll over would secure him
from danger; yet he does not budge
until the motive power of the eagle sets
him going. In jungle country the eagle
does sometimes come within sight of the
sea, but he never lives close to it. The
ozone is said to give him catarrh.
THE BUNYIP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The bunyip rose from the deep lagoon,
Where the shadows thinned and died,
As the last clouds scattered around the moon.
The night-wind whimpered a lonely tune,
While the stars stared, goggle-eyed,
At the mud-stained thing, like a slack balloon,
That cropped where the curlews cried.
Somebody passed by the patch of cane
To see how the cutting fared,
And he saw the bunyip “very plain,”
Its ghastly head and its grisly mane,
So somebody’s voice declared
When he banged on the shanty window-pane
Like one whom a ghost had scared.
The bunyip mooned by the long lagoon;
It shimmered among the trees.
The ’possums paused in their game of “coon”;
The ’foxes flittered across the moon
And the bandicoots that sneeze
Went scampering home to bed too soon,
Ere the bunyip’s claws could seize.
And all the night went cold and still;
Nobody spoke at all
While the bunyip mumbled along the hill,
Eating of worms its horrid fill
Like a lizard along a wall.
And kids in bed got a dreadful thrill
When they heard the bunyip bawl.
The bunyip passed where the tired stars touch
The dim hill’s midnight brow;
The sound of its champing jaws was such
As made you think of a stalled car’s clutch.
But the next day Mum made vow,
“1 don’t believe in them bunyips much —
I’ll bet it was Mooney’s cow.”

THE MAN

THE
STUFF TO GIVE 'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
HIGH COUNTS AND HIGH YIELDS.
“Mouton”: I agree with “Dead
Finish” (B. 5/9/’34) about high counts
and high yields. It is not natural for
them to go together, because the small-
type merino produces fine wool, and the
large-framed the strong wool.
The small fine-woolled sheep is not
strong-constitutioned, and is incapable of
producing heavy cuts. Individual speci-
mens are no criterion. A 121 b. average
certainly does not seem possible.
Recently, I saw 2000 wethers shorn at
Mundi Mundi (Broken Hill district).
They cut 161 b. soz. and filled 86 packs.
These sheep were bred on Wirrialpa
(S.A.) and were by Bungaree rams. This
is not a record, but must be considered
a splendid cut. The wool ranged from
strong 60’s to 64’s quality. It was not
light in condition. The backs were dusty
but not sandy. And the yield would be
well up to average. I do claim, however,
that a flock like this, with great mutton
weights, is a better money-maker than
any fine-woolled flock.
WOOL TYPES.
“Dead Finish”: If “Sheepo” and
“Murrawong” (B. 5/9/’34) are still in a
quandary as to a common standard for
their show sheep, how about getting back
to first principles? If a medium wool
is a 64’s it would clarify matters con-
siderably for that section to be known
as a “64’s type,” and treat the higher and
finer grades similarly, without the use
of superlatives. This may sound revo-
lutionary, but it certainly is common-
sense.
The suggestion (B. 5/9 /’34) that a
small committee of wool experts classify
prior to judging would take a lot of un-
necessary responsibility from the judge,
and give him his types set for a straight-
ahead job.
Sheep do not run true to label. It is
almost as difficult to get two sheep alike
as to get two human faces, but they can
be grouped by an expert. A well-known
stud-breeder of some years ago re-
marked that he had spent half a lifetime
getting his sheep where he wanted them,
and expected to spend the remainder try-
ing to keep them there. This was in a
well-classed and heavily-culled stud flock,
and illustrates normal breeding difficul-
ties.
Any person who does not know the
distinction between a 64’s and a 70’s
would have to have the difference be-
tween medium and fine wool explained
to him ; so it would not matter much if
the “spinning-type section” idea was given
a try-out.
“Sheepo”: “Murrawong” (B. 5/9/’34)
is splitting straws when he says my sug-
gestion to call a 64’s a fine wool is re-
volutionary. I repeat that in all coun-
try competitions a definite quality line
should be manifest.
“Murrawong” wants to let a 64’s be re-
garded as medium, and a 70’s as fine.
The only difference in spinning capacity
between these two types is in what the
buyers think. All things being equal
manufacturers and retailers of the fin-
ished cloth regard both wools as similar
in value.
I still maintain that the sheep and
wool classes at shows will give growers
the correct understanding if 74’s or
better constitute the super-fine, 64’s-70’s
the fine, super 60’s the medium and
common 60’s the strong section.
For the extra strong, i.e., for anything
growing on a presumed merino sheep
under a 60’s, I’d suggest a goat’s class —
just for the butchers’ sakes.
DIP, JET AND CRUTCH.
“H.8.D.”: “G.F.D.” (B. 19/9/’34)
mentions his plan of dipping with six
to eight weeks’ wool on the sheep, and
crutching at seven to eight months.
I think it impossible to adhere to any
plan. One must be guided by the season,
which will influence the strike. Certainly
dip at the time mentioned, but if the fly
becomes bad in Nov.-Dee., with a July-
August shearing, jetting will noi carry
sheep over to the seventh month.
If the fly continues active into autumn
it might be necessary to crutch twice. I
maintain that crutching, together with
jetting or dressing, is the only way of
handling a bad strike. Jettihg alone will
not hold the fly.
I have seen people swabbing crutch
strikes on threequarter-woolled ewes
with different preparations. This opera-
tion hardened the tip and gave the mag-
gots greater protection, as well as invit-
ing further strike and “tracking.” The
irritation was so great that the ewes fell
away in condition, and a greater amount
of wool was damaged and lost than
would have been the case with crutching
only.
“Jass” (B. 19/9/’34) gives interesting
figures on the C.S.I.R. experiments.
What would be the effect on the fly if
everyone was compelled to trap?
In my opinion the few traps around
the countryside that catch hundreds of
thousands of flies (which is a compara-
tively low figure) only improve the con-
ditions for those remaining.
SMALL SUPER CLIPS IN S.A.
“Mouton”: The classing of the S.A.
wheatgrowers’ small clip is simple, as it
consists chiefly in light skirting and the
removal of earthy backs. The wool
usually is inferior to average top-makers’
type. Thus the only classing required is
the rejection of a few inferior fleeces.
The small super clip, however, needs
special attention, both in skirting and
classing. The clip is mainly of first
spinner’s type,' and any fault may reduce
its value pence per pound.
The most important factor is careful
skirting. There are usually some burr and
seed, and this should be removed even if
it entails heavy reduction. When the
sectioning has been heavy, it is advisable
to trim the skirtings and brand the bulky
pieces as broken.
The fleeces must also be carefully
classed. Buyers of high-class wool re-
quire evenness in length and quality, and
to be typed as “spinner’s” it must be
sound. These grading requirements must
be carefully attended to.
For example, a clip of 10 bales should
be divided as follows:
Super A.A. —The longest bright,
sound, fine fleeces.
Super A.A. Com. —The long, sound,
bright, strong fleeces.
A. —The reject fleeces, which are below
spinner’s length, unsound, fatty and
heavy.
It should be possible to avoid star lots
in both the main classes. But if the clip
is fine the strong class may of necessity
be a star.
WORKING THE SHED.
“Brumby”: “Richmond” (B. 19/9/’34)
is pulling wool over his own eyes if he
imagines that the average station-owner
would be willing to increase the number
of “rousies” once shearing is under way.
I have survived enough “shearing times”
to know that .this is never done provided
the wool is being kept away and pressed.
Nor would I advise this building-up
process.
There should be no difficulty in decid-
ing the number of “rousies” required,
but “Richmond,” like many owners,
fails to consider the most important
factors in predetermining the number
of shed-hands.
These factors are the layout of the
shed, design of table, and the condition
of the wool. If the layout (as in the
L shed) makes it necessary for the
shearer to cross the board to get to the
next sheep, the picker-up’s work is
greatly increased.
If the wool-tables are too small or
too large, too high or too low there is
again an increase of labor for the rest
of the hands. Most of all, fleeces which
break-up readily add enormously to the
work.
Labor needs do not depend so much
on the number of bales to the 1000 as
on the speed with which the wool can
be handled.
PESTS IN QUEENSLAND.
“Jakamaki”: “Dead Finish” (B.
29/8/’34) is right. Southern pests, parti-
cularly stomach and intestinal worms, are
creeping out into western and northern
Queensland. I have seen sheep drop-
pings from Longreach, Hughenden and
Prairie under the microscope. The number
of worm eggs in a drip of diluted excreta
would astonish the sheepman who
thinks sheep in those parts are clear of
worms.
The best drench known to science is
a mixture of carbon tetrachloride, tetra-
chlorethylene and paraffin oil, as now
widely used throughout New England
(N.S.W.). A third of an ounce is given
in a syringe to each grown sheep ; half
that dose for lambs and weaners.
A good mineral lick kept up to the
sheep all the year round will minimise
worm infestation as well as fly strike.
The size of a sheep worm is not always
an indication of its deadliness. The
ravages of the easily-seen barber’s-pole
stomach worm ( Hcemonchus contortus)
are bad enough, but the little Tricho-
strongylus can be located only with diffi-
culty, yet does more damage than the
big chap. The big worm is soon shifted
by the two tetra. chemicals, but the
little one is not so easily displaced,
Supplementary feeding is a valuable
ally against the tricho. worm. A few
ounces of concentrates, like linseed and
minerals mixed with salt, is the best
weapon.
PRESSING WOOL.
“Lion”: Pressing wool carefully is
worth while. Bales of top-line fleece
should be pressed within about 151 b. of
each other, and tight within reason. From
285-3001 b. of greasy merino fleece wool
per bale, on hand-power presses, is good
all-purpose weight. Bales so pressed rise
well on the showroom floor. Scales
should guide as to the weights of the first
bales pressed in each line. After that
evenness can be obtained as follows:
Fill the box and press to the same
height always, tread well, being sure to
fill all corners tight, and force down the
sides. It is here that the weight is ob-
tained and evenness assured. Refill
to same level again and tread as before.
Then fill space left, pushing the wool
well down by hand, and press.
It will be found that bales so pressed
will probably average within less than
151 b. of each other, provided the wool
has been well classed.
This uniformity can be obtained with-
out scales by the same means, but one
does not know until the weights are re-
turned how heavily one is pressing.
Heavier lines of fleece should not be
trodden as hard as the lighter ones. The
lower lines should not be pressed too
heavily, especially second pieces, bellies
and locks. From 3 50-4001 b. for these
lines is ample, and should not be ex-
ceeded.
Pressing wool by this method takes
no longer, costs no more and it pays on
the auction floor.
CHILLED BEEF.
“Rich. J.”: At last we are making
headway. According to Smithfield, the
Port Chalmers second shipment of
Queensland beef was the finest received
from any Australian port. Quality and
prices realised compared favorably with
Argentinian.
We have still two big hurdles to sur-
mount —bad stowing (10 p.c. of the Port
Chalmers shipment was badly discolored)
and inconsistency in quality.
The Wyndham shipment was voted un-
satisfactory. Pronounced plainness and
legginess were obviously caused by in-
adequate recuperating paddocks at the
killer for cattle arriving after a long trek.
Though the truth is often unpleasant
we must face the fact that inconsistency
in quality has always been our trouble.
I speak with the authority of one with
many years’ experience in Smithfield.
In the past exporters merely picked
out the best for home consumption and
sent the rest abroad. The Q.M.E. brand
seemed to be the only one with a
standard.
With success assured on the chilling
side, experts (not Government) should
be appointed to all killing works to see
that only good, even-grade beef is chilled.
If we must export inferior beef, let us
export it as frozen. This market, how-
ever, is not the one we want to cater for.
The root of the matter lies in breed-
ing methods. Exporters’ efforts are use-
less unless every grazier pulls his weight.
In 1932 Britain consumed 1,400,000
tons of beef, of which our share was
48,000 tons. There is no reason why
that 3 p.c. should not be increased to
30 p.c. of the supply.
SUMMER FODDERS.
“Sorghum”: Where the ground is
still not too cold and damp to impair
germination, the sowing of summer
fodders should begin. Every year we
have a fodder shortage which could
easily be averted. Money and labor
spent on sowing even a poor patch of
ground turns a liability into an asset.
Sudan grass—really a sorghum—is
about the most heavy yielding for either
hay or silage. On 50 acres one year' I cut
115 tons.
Some farmers shy clear of Sudan under
the impression that it is poisonous. So
it is—during the pre-flowering stage.
Once dried, no danger exists. Sudan
should be grown primarily as a hay crop,
and seed broadcast at 351 b. per acre will
give wonderful results.
“Amber” (B. 19/9/’34) mentions yel-
low grain maizes as being the most
popular. Personally, I have always got

best results from Silvermine, a white
grain, which in my opinion stands up
better to drought than any other variety.
Among the millets, Japanese is out on
its own. Being a remarkably quick
grower which comes on again rapidly
after being fed off, it is the best drought-
resister among the millets. Though it
is usual to drill the seed when sowing
for grain or ensilage, for summer fodder
seed should be broadcast —201 b. per acre.
While Sudan, Jap. millet and maize
are the most popular for summer feed,
amber cane, planter’s friend and sacca-
line are all worthy.
A good tip is to sow one of the
legumes—cow peas for preference—
with any of the above. The combination
provides good yield and improves soil
condition.
FERTILISER ECONOMICS.
• “Frank K.”: The various Departments
of Agriculture should advise farmers how
to manufacture fertilisers where the
natural material abounds. Every slaugh-
teryard has a big heap of bones which
dealers will buy. These in turn sell to
a manufacturer, who makes them into
bonemeal and again sells at a profit.
There is nothing to prevent a farmer get-
a small bonecrusher and crushing the
bone himself.
Again, imported phosphate, containing
about 37 to 38.5 p.c. of phosphoric acid,
largely citrate soluble, can be bought
direct for about £3 per ton. This is the
phosphate rock as it comes direct from
Nauru. Any farmer could grind this
rock on his own property. In its natural
state it is a slow-acting fertiliser, but if
ground up very finely to a dust is ideal
for coastal districts, as it is not washed
away by heavy rains.
Superphosphate will always hold its
own in the drier wheat areas, but on the
wetter coast' ground-up natural rock is
the cheapest fertiliser.
Lime could be got in many places as
cheaply as road metal. How to treat if?
This is simple. If a load of firewood is
spread out in a pit dug in the side of
the hill, with a load of lime on top, then
another load of firewood and another
load of lime, so that the wood can burn
and heat the limestone to a dull red heat,
there is soon a supply of caustic lime
available. After a few weeks’ exposure
to the air it will slack and become pow-
dery. Heavy clay soils like caustic lime,
whilst sandy soils like mild or slaked
lime.
In moderately rich soil it is always
better to use the slower-acting fertilisers,
as there is not the same loss of contents
as in some of the more soluble types.
MORE ABOUT SILAGE.
“Aerogenes”: “Sorghum” (B. 19/9/’34
is ill-equipped to offer advice to “X.T.”
on the matter of silage making.
It is certainly important to cut the
green crop at the right time, but not “so
that chemical action or oxidation will
develop a sufficient temperature to kill
the harmful bacteria.”
The action is essentially biological;
enzymes and bacteria ferment the green-
stuff and form heat and acids, which
in time stop their own action, so that
the material rests pickled in its own
juice. The admission of air will permit
more organic action, chiefly mould
growth, which results in spoiling of the
feed. The top layer, however, is useful
in its mould-growing, as it thus forms a
tight mat which seals up the lower part
from the air.
The sprinkling of salt, as suggested by
“Sorghum,” is certainly not good, as salt
is a preventer of bacterial action, and
would thus interfere with the normal
pickling. Salt is added to hay as it is
put into a stack, to help dry the material
—which is the last thing wanted in silage.
“Sorghum” is funny when he says
occasional fumigation with carbon bi-
sulph. will keep the ensilage free from
weevils. He might just as well have
added that an odd spraying with cattle
dip would keep the stuff free from ticks,
which are about as prevalent in it as
weevils. When a mass of silage is so shut
off from air that mould will not grow,
is it likely that a weevil will live?
Also, how is one to introduce carbon
bisulphide into silage through a cover-
ing of material made airtight, even to the
extent of putting on a layer of grain and
malting it into a tight mass?
“Lucerne”: “Sorghum” (B. 19/9/’34)
has apparently had no experience with
lucerne ensilage.
I have made ensilage from various
crops, including oats, wheat, maize and
sorghum, and there is not one (with the
possible exception of maize) to compare
with lucerne.
“Sorghum” states that “experienced
farmers realise that lucerne is more valu-
able as hay.” If the farmer is experi-
enced, he knows that the first cut of the
season does not make good hay, owing
to the presence of other growths, but
that it makes most excellent ensilage.
It is also difficult in most districts to
make good hay of the last cut in the
autumn, owing to cool weather condi-
tions and heavy dews, and it is much
wiser to put this consignment, too, into
pits.
QUALITY IN WHEAT.
“Fair Go”: Evidence does not always
support “H.U.C.’s” contention (B.
29/8/’34) that “authorities hold that we
lose price and markets by lack of grad-
ing.”
In theory it should be the case, but at
present English buyers do not look for
strength in Australian wheat and are not
usually prepared to pay extra for it.
W.A., with a quick-maturing season,
generally produces a high-quality grain.
Several trial shipments have been sent
to test the English market. In one case,
the Government took the trouble to
advertise a special consignment before
its arrival. Soon afterwards a shipload of
rather poor floury grain which local
buyers had wanted to “dock” was sent
along. The result upset all the theories,
for both lots got the average market
price.
Apparently, it is only the local miller
who is worried about tho quality of our

a small proportion of the total crop

cate any costly grading system until our
export market is prepared to pay for it.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Kingsley T.”: One of the best
dodges to scare off crows and cockatoos
is to hang up a few of the beggars them-
selves. Erect their small gibbets at inter-
vals in the paddocks.
“Bianco”: Cream keeps better if con-
tents are rendered uniform by stirring
after each addition to the can. A semi-
circular piece of lin. pine with a broom-
handle set in at a slight angle makes a
useful non-scratching stirrer if kept clean.
“Bill R.”: When roofing in a valley,
do not screw or nail down the sheet iron.
If you do expansion and contraction will
work elongated holes in the bed and
cause leakages. Put a few nails along
the side rims of the sheet and clinch
them over. They and the corrugations
above will hold the valley sheet firmly
in place.
“Horsey”: It is well to remember
that carbon tetrachloride is only suitable
as a sheep drench, and must be given
as directed. If the sheep are fed too
much protein deaths may occur unless
they are taken off such feed ten days
before dosing. Never follow the advice
of anyone who suggests giving carb.-tet.
to cattle. It is poison to them at all
times.
“F.L.8.”: To break the band round
a bale of packs insert a heavy L-shaped
adjustable wrench underneath and screw
the jaws up tight. Press down quickly,
and the band is cleanly broken. Save
the bands and holders, as they have many
uses —to strengthen sheep troughs, fix
netting to strainer posts and make ties
for buildings, for instance. The holders
make good washers.
“Chook”: Many amateur poultry-
farmers think that when hens cease lay-
ing and go into the moult a decreased
ration will suffice. The reverse is really
the case, since the building up of a new
crop of feathers is a severe drain on the
hen’s vitality. The better the ration the
quicker the feathers are replaced, and
the sooner egg production recom-
mences.
“Beefo”: It pays to breed fat cattle
for the meatworks, does it? A mob of
235 bullocks and cows (bullocks aver-
aged 6981 b., cows 4851 b.) trucked from
Kajabbi (n.-w. Q.) to Townsville gave a
gross return of £624. Railway and drov-
ing expenses took £292, leaving the
owner a return of 28s. 4d. per head.
Out of the latter had to be taken the
Government’s whack for taxation, rent
and incidentals. Under existing con-
ditions it’s one owner in a thousand who
can produce fats under £3 a head, but
you couldn’t tell that to a politician.

Blue skies, a considerate sun, scintillating
ocean and harbor, clean, brilliant, safe
beaches call you now. Gorgeous gardens
and miles of orchards and farms in their spring
settings add to your pleasure. The Metropole is
in close juxtaposition to all these—as to all theatrical

and the amount of forfeit increased. This
would pay for the extra dole, and so on,

AN OLD ART ‘
“Face-lifting for men is the latest.” ()
„ _ _ , T ... ’"!!
Latest. Faugh. I lifted laces in this
country years ago. I have altered the
weirdest physiognomies, and made poli-
ticians look almost intelligent. One of my
most brilliant successes was a cunningly
devised twist to the mouth-corners of
some of the more lugubrious-looking
“What are you doing with that cigar?”
“Well, the old man won’t let me smoke cigarettes.”
members of the clergy, resulting in their
most gloomy sermons being delivered
with a face beaming like that of a bookie
on an outsiders’ day. It resulted, I was
told by delighted clients, in greatly aug-
mented offertories.
I remember one operation which,
though successful and in its way bril-
liant, yet lost me one of my most valued
clients. I had lifted Guppy’s fat face and
fatter fees on many occasions. He had
a large burnished dome and was an
ardent admirer of George Robey, and
expressed a desire for a set of eyebrows
arched like those of the famous
comedian. Ordinarily a simple matter,
it proved most difficult in Guppy’s case,
owing to the question of determining
where his face ended and his head be-
gan.
However, I did what I considered
an excellent job under adverse condi-
tions. I may, perhaps, have gathered up
slightly too much slack, as his face was
very mobile, but, anyway, Guppy, who
was most finicky and difficult to please,
complained that when his face registered
surprise his eyebrows disappeared over
the back of his head, whilst with his hat
on and a normal expression they
weren’t visible at all. He didn’t come
back after that.

CULINARY HINTS FOR GRASS
WIDOWERS,
It is a good thing to vary your menu
occasionally. Instead of having fried
sausages for the daily tea at night, try
grilling them for a change, or you can
have fri e£ l sausages with gravy as a varia-
tion. In fact, there is almost no limit
to the ways in which you can have saus-
ages. Here, at last, is your opportunity
to C ut away from culinary conventions.
You can even experiment a bit and try
boiling them, either with of without their
jackets. The same applies to eggs, but
on ]y a t the week-ends (you won’t have
time to experiment on working days),
The really experienced married bache-
lor has the preparation of the matutinal
egg down to a fine art. He boils it in
his shaving water, leaving it on while
he de-hirsutes his features. The amateur
attempting this has to be most careful,
though, as there are pitfalls for the un-
wary. A very quick once-over, for in-
stance, will mean a too-soft-boiled egg,
which will have to be taken through a
straw or drunk straight from the shell ;
while the very slow individual who goes
over twice will find that he’ll have to
use a hacksaw blade to get the top off
his henfruit, and operate upon the flinty
contents with a cold chisel and a mallet.
As in everything, the thing is to strike
the happy medium.

THE SHELTERED LIFE.
Bella looked out into the grey, rainy
streets and at the factory girls hastening
to work. Later would come the office
girls.
She wouldn’t like their jobs, coming
home in the evenings, spoken to at street
corners. Then their employers! That
typist had whispered things about her
boss.
Of course, Miss Wooler, the lady clerk
next door, had laughed at talk of this
sort. Still, Bella, for her part, wouldn’t
like to be cooped up with one man, he
perhaps wanting to say things—not just
being saucy but really meaning them.
Better to have a lot of men round you
at once! They were just like women to
you then—friendly like.
The door clanged, and her meditations
were interrupted as three carters entered
for their morning solace.
Bella the barmaid stepped up to the

PEEPS AT THE PROFESSIONS.
VI.—THE ARTIST.
At landscapes, seascapes, stills or lifelike
Portraits done in ink or oils,
Busts in bronze or whitest marble,
All his life the artist toils.
Pictures no one wants to buy
Lie neglected on his shelf.
What cares he for man’s approval
If he can express himself ?
But the trouble I confess:
He’s often nothing to express.
An artist is a person who feels the
urge to express himself. He usually does
so in paint of some kind, but some
artists prefer clay, marble or other hard
substance. .Some have even tried their
hand in butter, but this medium cannot
be recommended, particularly with
summer coming on. It is so difficult to
keep the expression constant, and a
masterpiece of dairy sculpture executed
at a winter temperature and representing
“The Joy of Youth” may be so changed
by Christmas that it looks like an Indian
famine piece.
The principal difference between
ancient and modern sculpture is that the
figures in the latter have arms. With
paintings the difference is that you can’t
sell the modern ones. To be really suc-
cessful nowadays an artist needs to have
been dead for at least 200 years.
.Some of the moderns have tried to get
over the difficulty of competition with
the Past by painting differently. This
Modernist school paints pictures which
can only be appreciated when the be-
holder is the same distance from the
picture as the artist was from the original
scene.
These pictures are hard to paint,
as the artist has to paint the scene as he
imagines it would look if he were as'
close to it as he is to his canvas. Then
he has to walk back to see if the picture
looks like what the scene looked like
from where he was painting it. Indolent
artists save the walk by examining the
picture through the reverse end of a
telescope, but the energetic ones scorn
this method, and walk the regulation
half mile or so
after each stroke
of the brush.
They become
very athletic and
well developed, but
they don’t sell
many pictures. For
one thing they
take so long to
paint, and then
few people have
rooms half a mile
long in which to
hang them. Of
course, if you have
a friend half a
mile away you can
always arrange to
hang your picture
in his house.
Portrait-painters
exist partly on suf-
ferance, and partly
because they flat-
ter their subjects
in a way the
camera cannot.
There are many
sitters who would best be painted on the
Modernist system, but unfortunately they
go to the wrong artists.
Pavement artists deserve special men-
tion. They care not for the judgment of
posterity, and are content with the praise
of their contemporaries. Their motto
is “A penny in the hat is worth two on
the slate.” They never sell a picture.
yet they contrive to make a living
from their art, which is more than many
other artists can say.
Finally, they are the only members of
the profession who have the courage to
label their pictures “All my own work.”

Information Sought.
Can the trustees of a ground in N.S.W. dedi-
cated as a “showground, racecourse and athletic
sportsground” prevent golf being played ?—•
3245.
It is entirely a matter for the trustees, who
are under no compulsion to allow golf to be
played. The N.S.W. Lands Department makes
no objection so long as golf does not inter-
fere with the purposes to which the land is
dedicated.
(1) Is there an accepted process by which new
wine may derive the quality of old wine ?
Could it be carried out. by pasteurising ? Would
placing in warm water at a temperature of 185
deg. Fahr. help ? (2) Does wine grown old in
the bottle become richer in alcohol ? (3) Does
age affect color ? —3616.
(1) There have been reports of an American
invention for artificially “aging” wine, but
nothing is known of it in Australia. Sometimes
young wines of certain types are put out in the
sun in hogsheads—not with the object men-
tioned, but to assist maturing. The esters which
give bouquet can only be built up by time.
Pasteurising will help in preserving, but will
not enrich. Good breeding, with the usual
care (racking, fining, balancing, etc.) from
early youth and onwards until the bottling
period, and then the selection and treatment
of corks, bottles, laying down, etc., is the only
way at present accepted whereby a wine can
reach a healthy maturity. Wine would cease
to exist as such if exposed to a temperature of
185 deg. for two hours. The sugars would
change, and, as spirit vaporises at a much lower
temperature than this, most of it would boil
away. (2) No. (3) Yes. Red wines become
lighter, and white slightly darker.
How to prevent second fermentation in wine
after bottling ? After my wine is bottled and
standing for some time in the summer heat
the corks blow. —3528.
In the case of dry wine, the only way to
avoid fermentation in the bottle is to make
absolutely certain that complete fermentation
is made before bottling. In the case of sweet
wine, the addition of fortifying spirit will
arrest the fermentation and ensure against
second fermentation.
(1) What is the accumulated surplus of the
friendly societies of the world? (2) For Aus-
tralia ? (3) For M.L. ? (4) Are members trans-
ferable from any lodge to any other lodge of
the same fraternity ? —3524.
(1) No reliable information available. (2) The
1932-33 report of the N.S.W. Registrar gives
total funds of the friendly societies in Australia
as £15,056,204. (3) The same report quotes the
accumulated funds of the friendly societies of
M. for the year ended December 31, 1932,
the last available date, as £4,398,158. (4) Trans-
fers can be made in accordance with the rules
of the individual societies.
(1) Cost of an aviation pilot's license and
approximate duration of course ? (2) Where
can I obtain instruction ? —3582.
(1) Ordinary, or “A,” license, £5O to £6O.
Duration of course, about six weeks, depend-
ing upon the number of hours devoted weekly
and upon the state of the weather. Commer-
cial, or “B,” license, about £250; duration,
12 to 18 months. (2) From Aero Club of
N. Mascot, N.S.W.
(1) Total length of State highways and C.R.B.
main roads in Vic. ? (2) Motor registration
receipts in Vic. for year ending- June, 1933,
cmd proportion spent by the Country Roads
Board ? (3) Has the board any other funds;
if so, how much ? —3379.
0) State highways, 2297 miles; main roads,
6367 miles. In addition to State highways and
main roads there are 3607 miles of declared
developmental roads. (2) The net amount re-
ceived by the board from this source was
£1,085,864 18s. 7d., the whole of which was
expended by the board. (3) For the current
financial year £290,000 is available from State
loan money, approximately £360,000 from the
Federal roads grant, and £68,000 from
unemployment-relief funds.
(1) Do Japanese ships carry passengers from
Australia to European ports ? (2) What is the
lowest fare in a Japanese ship from Sydney to
Tokio ? (3) How is a passport obtained ?
3354.
(1) No. (2) The lowest fare from Sydney to
Yokohama (which is the port of disembarkation
for Tokio) is £24. In addition to this, a deposit
of £25 is required by the shipping co., but is
refunded to passenger after the Customs officials
of Japan have granted permission to land.
(3) By application to the nearest branch of the
Customs Department.
(1) (a) Steamer fares and (b) train and steamer
fares, Brisbane to Hobart, to obtain Child Wel-
fare Nursing Certificate at a Hobart training
clinic ? (2) Are single steamer fares to Tas-
mania cheaper during the apple season ? —3365.
(1) Nurses or trainees are not allowed conces-
sion unless on holidays. They must take a
return ticket; they then are allowed 10 p.c.
rebate on all inter-State ships, but nothing on
the oversea liners. The single fare, Brisbane
to Sydney and Sydney to Hobart, first saloon,
would be £9 55., and tourist or third class
£6 ss. From December, or when the coastal
clauses of the Navigation Act allow it, a pas-
senger may join one of the overseas ships at
Brisbane for Hobart via Sydney: the cost
first saloon is £11; by a tourist-class ship
of the Bay or P. and O. Branch line,
£6 15s. (2) Single fares are not cheaper during
the apple season, but a return fare is cheaper
by the inter-State ships. For instance, at pres-
ent the return fare to Hobart is £lO, but from
November on it will be £8 10s.'
(1) Best method of marketing a new kitchen
cleanser ? (2) Must it pass a test ? (3) Cost
of printing labels in two colors ? (4) Cost of
tins ?—3552. *
(1) You can either advertise and build up by
publicity or distribute samples through grocers
and hardware merchants, trusting to quality to
bring orders. (2) No test required, but it should
contain only harmless, non-poisonous materials.
(3) and (4) Printed canisters are more suitable
than labelled tins: Shackleton, Mason and Co.,
Ltd., 328 Botany-road, Alexandria, N.S.W., or
James Robertson, 136 Nelson-street, Annan-
dale, N.S.W., will quote prices.
Can you tell me something about spondy-
litis ? Is it curable, and what treatment is
usually given ? —3489.
Spondylitis is vertebral inflammation. In
chronic cases, and especially in the aged, a
general rheumatic arthritis develops, most
resistant to treatment. Extremes in any form
aggravate the trouble, the congestion and con-
sequent friction of opposing spondyles causing
pain and deformity as the disease progresses.
In the early stages, massage movements, both
active and passive, are usually helpful; septic
absorption from teeth, bowels, etc., demands
attention where there is reason to suspect a
toxic influence. lodide of potash may be
prescribed as an internal remedy. Medical
supervision of treatment is essential.
/ am considering a walking tour from
Victoria to Darwin ( N.T .) with a capital of
£3O. (1) What are my chances of getting
through ? (2) Best route to take ? —3554.
(1) You should be able to do it if you follow
a stock route. (2) Via Bourke, Quilpie, up
the Barcoo to Longreach, thence via Clon-
curry and Mt. Isa to Camooweal, Brunette, Eva
Downs, Newcastle Waters and up the O.T.
Line. It’s all pretty level going by that route.
American journals frequently refer to the
Hall of Fame; what is it ? —3596.
“The Hall of Fame for Great Americans” is
the result of an anonymous donation, in 1900,
of 100,000 (later increased to 250,000) dol-
lars to the council of the New York Univer-
sity. A colonnade, 600 ft. long, provides 150
panels, each about 2ft. by 6ft. in area, every
panel to bear the name of a renowned Ameri-
can. Only those who have been dead ten or
more years are eligible to be chosen. The
names are drawn from lists of distinguished
men and women of every class and profession,
and are nominated by the public. These names
are then submitted by the council of the uni-
versity to an electorate of a hundred prominent
citizens of the United States, and only those
candidates who receive a majority of votes can
be accepted. Fifty names were to be inscribed
at the beginning of this century, and five addi-
tional names every fifth year thereafter until
the year 2000, when the inscriptions would be
completed. But in 1900 only 29 candidates
received the required number of votes, and the
numbers since have been irregular. The Hall
of Fame includes a large museum containing
mementoes of “the mighty dead.” A Hall of
Fame for Women, with fifty panels, has also
been established.
Why is Anatole France so often described as
“the author of ‘Crainquebille,’ ” one of his
shorter works? —36o3.
Because this story (later turned into a three-
act play in collaboration with Lucien Guitry)
is most characteristic of his style. It was his
fixed opinion, repeated in numerous works,
that the illiterate poor may sign their very
livelihoods away, especially in France, because
they are ignorant of leeal forms and jargon.
The surface story of “Crainquebille” touches
this obsession, but it appeals to the French as
a parable of the Dreyfus case.
Origin and meaning of Tory ? —3618.
Up till the seventeenth century “Tory” was
a term applied to outlaws or insurgents in both
England and Ireland. It is derived from an
old' Gaelic word Toiridhe, meaning a pursuer.
In the eighteenth century the name described
the Conservative party. Dr. Johnson put the
new meaning in a nutshell: “The prejudice of
the Tories is for Establishment, that of the
Whigs [Liberals] for innovation.” The word
is nowadays attached (by innovating parties) to
all who oppose innovating parties.
(1) Any books about Margaret Catch pole ?
(2) Has all trace of her grave in the Richmond
churchyard been lost ? —3444.
(1) G. B. Barton’s “True Story of Margaret
Catchpole” was published in 1924. There is
also the book by Rev. Richard Cobbold, pub-
lished in 1845, which is more fiction than fact
and confuses her story with that of Mary
Haydock. (2) Two sites in the Richmond
Cemetery have been claimed as her resting-
place, one being in the Innes portion of the
cemetery, but it is not possible to definitely
locate the spot. The church records show that
she was buried there on May 14, 1819.
Details concerning Jeno Letter and the Letter
String Quartet, many records of whose play-
ings have been broadcast ? —3502.
Jeno Lener, founder and leader of the quar-
tet, was born in Hungary in 1894, and studied
the violin at Budapest. He and the other three
musicians shut themselves in a house for three
years and practised untiringly before appearing
in public. In 1927 they played the whole of
Beethoven’s quartet in. six recitals. They
have played in all parts of Europe, in the
U.S.A., and in Britain.
Was there more than one Van Eyck ? If
so, which one painted the picture in the Mel-
bourne Gallery? Any biographical details? —
3468.
Yes, Hubert and Jean, and certain paintings
are attributed to Margaret or Margharita Van
Eyck, who may have been either their sister
or Jean’s wife. The Melbourne Gallery pur-
chase is attributed to Jean, the most important
member of the family. Hubert was born in
1365, and Jean in 1385. Hubert received the
freedom of the town of Ghent and died on
September 18, 1426. He was buried at
St. Saviour’s, Ghent, and later his right arm
was exhumed and the bone hung in an iron
case in the porch of the church. Jean was
employed by Phillip 111., Duke of Burgundy,
for diplomatic missions as well as artistic ones,
and was apparently very well thought of in
both capacities. He died in 1441.
Any information about O. W. Brierley, marine
painter ? —2994.
He was Sir Oswald Walters Brierley, R.W.S.
and F.R.G.S. He was trained in naval archi-
tecture at Plymouth, and was formally adopted
by Queen Victoria to accompany the Princes on
their sea voyages. He accompanied Admiral
Sir Henry Keppel to the Crimea, and made
paintings of the British and French fleets in
the Mediterranean. He was a successful exhi-
bitor at all the best shows in Europe. He be-
came friendly with Benjamin Boyd, and came
to Australia with him in his private yacht.
While Brierley was in Sydney Boyd and his
yacht disappeared, and Brierley was given a
passage home in the Rattlesnake. He came to
Australia again in 1868 with the Duke of
Edinburgh in the Galatea. At a house called
The Rangers in Mosman, he painted a picture
on the wall of the dining-room, “The Rattle-
snake in a Storm.”
What are the “seven sciences” so often re-
ferred to? —3518.
Mathematics, physics, chemistry, astronomy,
geology, biology and psychology. Mathematics
comes first, because without this instrument of
thought constructive advances could not have
been made in physics, chemistry and astronomy.
Historically physics preceded chemistry, and
both of these were developed before progress
was made in astronomy and before geologi-
cal and biological studies became systematised.
Much of astronomy is fundamental to geology,
and the knowledge yielded by stones helped
to reveal the secrets of living matter. Psycho-
logy, youngest of the sciences, has emerged
from the wilderness of metaphysical specula-
tion in the proportion that biology has
presented a more and more accurate picture
of the structure and functioning of the sense
organs and the whole nervous system.
(1) When were postage stamps first issued and
by what country ? (2) Philatelic magazine suit-
able for a boy of ten, and where procurable ?
—2827.
(1) By Great Britain in May, 1840, when the
Id. black and 2d. blue were issued; but as
early as 1838 stamped covers were sold in
Sydney at Is. 3d. doz. (2) “Australian Stamp
Monthly,” 6d., from A. A. Rosenblum, Box
1944, G.P.0., Melbourne.
How to measure the speed of water in a
stream ? —3670.
Select a portion of the stream where the sec-
tion is fairly regular, say 60ft. in length along
the bank, then throw a float, such as a bottle
sunk down to the cork, into the stream and
note the time it takes to travel that distance.
Repeat this several times and take the mean
speed, which is obtained by dividing the length,
i.e., 60ft., by the time taken, in minutes. The
speed thus measured is the surface speed, which
is greater than the speed near the bottom or
sides, the difference depending upon the nature
of the channel. If the water moves in a
wooden trough with smooth sides and bottom,
deduct 15 p.c.; if a brick channel, 20 p.c.;
if the sides and bottom are earth, 25 p.c.; and
in rough mountain streams, 30 p.c. to 40 p.c.
(1) How to determine the h.p. necessary to
raise water to any given height ? (2) How to
find the pressure of a column of water from
an elevated tank ? —3683.
(1) Multiply the number of gallons per minute
by 10, then multiply the result by the height, in
feet, and divide the product by 33,000. This
gives theoretical h.p. The actual h.p. required
will depend upon the efficiency of the pump;
theoretical h.p. doubled will be the approximate
power required. (2) Multiply the vertical height,
in feet, from the surface of the water in the
tank to the bottom of the pipe by 0.434. The
answer is in lb. per sq. in.

Ihe fence has to keep everything safe—it has to keep
the stock safe from straying—it has to keep the crops
safe from damage by straying beasts. Its strength and
permanency are so important that no other fence but
Cyclone is worth considering.
No other fence but Cyclone is made entirely of HARD-
steel wire. No other fence but Cyclone possesses the
Ring-Lock Joint that no beast can break or shift, and
that is so wear-and-weather-proof as to be practically
everlasting.
Penny-wise pound-foolish applies above all to fencing.
Get Cyclone!—especially now that prices are lower
than they have ever been before. Remember—Cyclone
needs absolutely no maintenance or repairs.
There is the correct type of “Cyclone” Ring-lock for every class
of fencing (sheep, lambs, cattle, horses, pigs). For paddock
subdivision — whether temporary or permanent — “Cyclone”
Ring-lock fence stands alone.
“CYCLONE” is not a “type” of fence, but is our registered
trade mark, and can only be legally applied to fencing
manufactured by us.

nearly all might have been the work of an
illiterate, self-righteous dunderhead with
a religious complex. Recently the

“Say 99”: In whatever spirit world he
may dwell, my friend Conan Doyle
should feel a glow of appreciation at the
latest honor paid him. C.D. died four
years ago, 44 years after Holmes and
Watson had first bowed to the public in
the “Strand Magazine.” But now, in Lon-
don, a Sherlock Holmes Society has been
born, and distinguished doctors have
drunk to its health. Two members of the
society refused a common taxi and
arrived in a hansom—Dr. Watson rode
in nothing but hansoms ; two other mem-
bers drank nothing but Beaune, Dr.
Watson’s favorite tipple. The chairman
donned a cap with earflaps, Sherlock’s
habitual headgear. Then somebody read
a congratulatory letter from Dr. Wat-
son himself. He is now 82, poor old
boy. He still sees the odd patient, it
seems, but distrusts his medical powers.
Strange—but very delightful—how these
people born of printer’s ink seem,
through the years, to become a part of
our lives!
“Little Ring”: In the U.S.A. marbles
has been cultivated to a high pitch, a
national championship being held annu-
ally to round off countless State and
city title-battles. Over 200,000 boys
entered for this year’s championship. The
winner was a 13-year-old lad from New
Jersey, Seaver; he beat a lad from
Louisiana and one from Tennessee. There
were 12,500 to watch the epic struggle.
The winner collected a gold medal and a
gilded crown, an all-wave radio set, a
gold wrist-watch, a bicycle and a holi-
day tour. Why work, young man? Play
marbles!

“Cash Amateur”: The committee
appointed by the Davis Cup conference
to look into the matter of the expenses
of future Davis Cup teams has put in
some dirty work —though that depends
on the way you look at it. Its recom-
mendation —to be presented next year—
is that the expenses of only two players
be allowed instead of the customary
three, a levy of 10 per cent, on the gross
receipts from matches in Europe going
to a fund for the purpose. The money
for extra players and their wives, if any,
will have to be raised by the people send-
ing them, though that is already the rule.

“Jbn el Issar”: Cricket history was
made when Amar Singh, who represented
India against Jardine’s Eleven, turned
pro., having signed up with Colne, one
of the many Lancashire League clubs
which now recruit their ranks from
every cricket country in the Empire. He
is a first-class bowler and a useful bat.
By his name, A.S. should be a Sikh.
That means that, though not a rabid
observer of caste as the Hindu proper
understands it, he is still bound in many
caste observances. For instance, he may
not eat beef, nor may any unbeliever
pollute the vessels he eats from by touch-
ing them, to name only a couple of them.
Possibly, however, Amar has gone
Christian or otherwise thrown the faith
of his fathers to the winds. Unless he
has, he is going to have a touchy time
i’ Lancashire, especially if he doesn’t
get his hair cut, a thing even Christian-
ised Sikhs hate doing.

’“I.Z.”: Somebody commented a week
or two back on the hideous incongruity
presented by the spectacle of “blazers,”
once reserved for cricket grounds and
possibly smoking-rooms, being worn by
unregenerate youth in city streets. The
fashion is certainly calculated to make
an older generation shudder, but I am
doubtful if it will last. It struck me
that the modern edition of Joseph’s coat
had about touched bottom the other
day when I saw the wearer of one being
run in. He wasn’t a drunk or a sloven,
either ; his boots shone, his tweed pants
were beautifully creased and (but for
his coat) he presented all the appearance
of a leisured man about town. His
upper garment closely resembled the
blazer of a famous English cricket club,
some of which the slop-shops imitate so
closely, and he marched between two
stalwart cops. “Caught shoplifting,” a
bystander explained. I suspect that a
man in a blazer, behaving suspiciously,
will be an object of special interest in
that shop for a long time to come.

For easiest and speediest
tyre inflation ....
The “RENRUT” pump offers remarkable, service, ease ana
efficiency in tyre inflation.
It is the pump with a quadruple compression—a double-
acting cylinder, drawing in air both with the up and
down stroke, so providing a volume usually
obtained only with a barrel twice the size.
Manipulation of this large volume is ren-
dered very easy by the inner high-
pressure cylinder.
Stronely built and handsomely
finished, the “Renrut” Quadruple
is the pump for speed and

The Steering Column.
STANDARD 20 SETS A STANDARD
BRITISH CAR WITH AMERICAN PERFORMANCE.
BY FRED BERRY.
HPHREE years ago the Standard Motor Co., Coventry, took
the bull by the horns and scrapped existing models. With
the addition to its staff of two clever American designers, a
new series was evolved, and on testing the “16” some two years
ago the writer suggested that with a slightly more powerful
engine the car would fully satisfy the most critical of Australian
motorists.
Now the “16” has been equipped for the “colonial” market
with a 20-h.p. motor, and, tested last week over “The Bulletin”
course, the wisdom of the change was made obvious, for, as
performance figures clearly indicate, the additional 12 b.h.p.
provides the extra punch on hills and in top-gear pick-up
hitherto found only in American types.
With a wheelbase of 110 inches and
standard 4ft. Sin. track the Standard
16 four-door sedan provides comfort-
able seating for five adults, leg room in
Graceful and efficient. The Standard 20 four-door sedan tested over The
Bulletin course.
driver’s compartment being particularly
generous.
Steering and suspension still closely
follow British and Continental practice.
Steering is of the high-geared type—
Diagram of Standard distributor head,
showing micrometer timing adjustment.
three-quarters of a turn of the wheel
gives full lock from centres. Springs of
heavy section are stiff at low speed.
Both steering and suspension are heavy
below 15 m.p.h., but the safety factor
and the element of controllability at
high speeds are at a very high standard.
A further noteworthy feature of the
new design is the long, rakish bonnet.
Every part of the motor is readily acces-
sible, and the construction permits of a
pressed-steel bulkhead to house the bat-
tery, tools and all accessories, so that
passengers need not be disturbed in the
event of trouble on the road.
The side-by-side-valve 6-cyl. engine
(R.A.C. rating 19.84 h.p.) has a bore of
73mm. and stroke 106 mm., swept volume
being 2663.7 c.c. With a compression
ratio of 5.5 to 1 the engine develops
60 b.h.p. at 3600 revs.
Detachable cylinder heads are fitted.
Aluminium pistons, each with four rings,
and light alloy connecting-rods are
attached to a sturdy crankshaft, scientifi-
cally balanced and running in seven bear-
ings. The light reciprocating units and
rigid crankshaft, coupled with the fact
that the complete power unit is sus-
pended in the chassis on live rubber sup-
ports, provide smooth and vibrationless
running throughout the entire speed
range.
The aluminium induction manifold is
of modern “square” design in order to
promote turbulence of the incoming
gases and so reduce the possibility of
pinking or knocking when low-grade
fuels are used. Fuel is taken from a 10-
gallon tank suspended between the rear
aumb-irons by a mechanical pump fitted
with a priming device, and after passing
through a large-section gauze filter and
settling bowl is taken to a Solex car-
burettor, which incorporates an easy-
start unit whereby the necessity for choke
operation is, except in extremely cold
weather, eliminated. An air-cleaner and
silencer of large dimensions is attached
to the intake side of the carburettor, and
a hot spot, cast
in the induction
pipe, ensures easy
starting from
cold.
Water circula-
tion in the cool-
ing system is by
means of a cen-
trifugal pump
driven in con-
junction with the
four-bladed fan
from the crank-
shaft ; and engine
temperature
is controlled by
means of an ad-
justable thermos-
tat, located in an
accessible posi-
tion immediately
above the cylin-
der block.
High - pressure
lubrication system is used, the oil gauge
showing between 501 b. and 801 b. accord-
ing to speed and temperature, while 17
pints of oil is required to fill the sump.
A cartridge-type oil-purifier and pressure-
regulator is included in the oil line.
Twelve-volt electrical equipment is
used, ignition, coil-and-battery type, in-
cluding automatic advance and retard,
with micrometer adjustment. Starter
motor is provided with dual control.
Turning the ignition key left gives
Startex self-starting, wherein a relay
turns the starting gear automatically
should the motor stall. Turning the key
right allows the engine to be started in
conventional manner by pressing a
button on the dashboard.
Transmission is through a single-plate
dry clutch to a four-speed-and-reverse
gearbox with central control lever. Top-,
third- and second-gear pinions are easy-
change helical-cut synchromesh type,
while a free-wheeling unit, controlled by
Bowden cable from the steering-column,
is built integral with the gearbox. Hardy-
Spicer universal joints are fitted to both
ends of the propeller shaft, and final
drive, spiral bevel, housed in banjo-type
casing, has a reduction ratio of 4.75 to 1.
Rear axles are semi-floating.
Braking equipment is mechanically
operated through enclosed cables, and
both hand and foot controls apply the
shoes on all four wheels. The hand-
brake lever is located in a horizontal
position between driver and passenger.
The chassis frame is X-type, with cross
member in front, giving great torsional
rigidity, while steering is on the Marles-
Weller cam-and-lever system, with pro-
vision for adjustment of wear.
The bodywork is in keeping with
moderns conventions, while in closed cars
“no-draught” ventilation is used in rear
windows.
The sedan tested over The Bulletin
course was driven by W. Farr, of Buckle
and Harden, Ltd., N.S.W. distributors,
and with driver and two passengers
weighed 32cwt.
Speedometer reading stood at 2008, but
despite this mileage the motor was still
somewhat stiff. Passing through the city
it was evident that the Standard must be
given full points for traffic-driving, the
38ft. turning circle, short wheelbase and
good top-gear acceleration being of
marked advantage in this connection.

motor ran smoothly and the car held the
road well.
Proceeding to the test climb of Kurra-
jong Mountain, the Grose Vale turn-off
was taken in order to test roadworthi-
ness under back-country conditions, and,
although the surface of the roadway was
extremely slippery by reason of heavy
rain overnight, the Standard held the

taken. Here further performance tests
were made, first, and perhaps most criti-
cal of the series, being the timing of
slow running in top gear for 350 yards,
followed immediately
by a similar distance
on full throttle —still
in top. On the slow-
running test the
Standard clocked two
minutes, averaging 6
m.p.h.; the idling jet
of the carburettor ob-
viously being set on
the fast side and so
detracting from a
better performance.
On the speed section,
however, better re-
sults were shown, the
time taken, 19sec.,
averaging 37.9 m.p.h.
—a very good performance.
Acceleration in top, third and second
gears from a steady speed of 10 to 30
m.p.h. was then taken, limes being re-
spectively 9 3-ssec., 7 4-ssec. and 5

taking an accurate reading by reason of
the jumpy action of the Jaegar speed-
ometer. 0 to 50 m.p.h. from a standing
start through all gears occupied 20 3-5
seconds, and in a test of the stopping
power of the Duo-Servo braking equip-
ment the car pulled up from a speed of
25 m.p.h. in 28ft.
Returning to headquarters via Penrith
the Standard was kept moving through
suburban and city traffic for some con-
siderable time, with the result that the

Keeping that New-car Complexion.
A motorist will usually admit that his
car is possibly his most valuable single
asset, yet many motorists drive serenely
on regardless of the fact that the depre-
ciation account is mounting at an alarm-
ing rate.
Next to wear and tear through usage,
the most potent destructive agent to con-
tend with is rust, and, despite cellulose
lacquers, chrome plating, bonderising of
exposed metalwork and many other
carefully-thought-out plans, those wicked
little rust spots will persist in putting in
an unwelcome appearance. In theory,
due to the highly specialised exterior fin-
ishes already enumerated, the motorist
should only see rust on the ends of ex-
posed bolts in running gear, but in prac-
tice those “threepenny” spots on the
edges of wings, on the cantrail of roofs
in sedans and on edges of door panels
will soon grow larger, and—what is of
still greater importance—will actually
consume the metal and reduce structural
strength.
It should be realised that procrastina-
tion is expensive in such cases and that
a set plan of correction should be re-
ligiously carried out from the first day
a car is put into commission.
Whenever the slightest sign of rust
appears anywhere—particularly on the
edge of the wings—take a piece of fine
emery paper and rub away the rust right
down to the clean metal. Then take a
clean and soft brush and carefully paint
on the correct color cellulose over the
clean patch (brushing lacquers are now
available at almost any store, garage or
accessory house). It will dry in a short
time, and if your brush is fairly well
charged a single coating will be sufficient.
The finished effect will be practically in-
distinguishable from new. Do not in
any case make the mistake of touching
over the rusty spot with this cellulose
brush, for all you are doing is to cover
up the rust and allow it to carry on its
work of destruction unseen. This is one
of the most frequent causes of deteriora-
tion. You will get quite a satisfactory
effect for the time being, but mean-

# The year 1934 has
seen
a step forward in motor
car design and construction
which has never before been
equalled. Yet in the face of this
advance the 1934 All-feature
Oldsmobile triumphantly leads
the field in all-round excellence
and pound-for-pound value.
It is a big car of 114" wheel-

84 guaranteed horsepower . . .
and it is so light on petrol that
at the highest average touring
speeds it will give you 21 miles
to a gallon of petrol.
Every sweeping line and

while the rust will go on growing and
spreading underneath the new and the

gets a shock or a jolt the surface will
come off, water will enter and that

Every day there can be seen some old
car on the road with mudguards looking
very much like colanders. This effect
has been due to carelessness, for with
road wheels daily throwing their quota
of mud on underside of guards the alter-
nate wetting and drying sets up ideal
conditions for rust production. Every
six months the undersides of the guards
should be carefully washed and scraped
free from mud, dust and tar and then
treated with a liberal application of any
heavy bitumous paint or enamel. While
on this job it is a wise policy to thor-
oughly clean all undergear, such as axles,
springs, brakerods, etc., and give them a
coating as well.
Motor Oddities.
“Three Spires”: Veteran car “reliabil-
ity trials” which specify 15 m.p.h.
through suburban streets leave me cold.
A 10-h.p. Calcott, a Coventry-built light
car of 1914 vintage, recently completed
a 1400-mile run from Katoomba to Bal-
larat and return with no more trouble
than a puncture. The outward trip was
completed in three days at an average
speed of 27 m.p.h., and the return, in-
cluding an all-night roadside hold-up by
the Murrumbidgee floods, in four days.
Average petrol consumption for the
whole trip was 36 m.p.g., a figure which
many modern cars would find hard to
beat under the conditions encountered.
Curious features of this old-timer, which
is owned by R. P. Anstey, of Katoomba,
include the omission of either fan or
water pump, and the provision of no
fewer than four universal joints in the
transmission.
The Trouble Lamp.
J.L.B. (Bathurst, N.S.W.). —What are the
stopping distances with this year’s cars ? A
friend claims that his new American car can
pull up in its own length at 30 m.p.h. Is that
possible ?
To stop in 15ft. at 30 m.p.h. is a physical
impossibility. The theoretical stopping distance
of 30.2 ft. is sometimes bettered in practice, but
if a car can stop in 35ft. it proves possession of
a highly efficient set of brakes.
J.L.O. (Valley, Q.). —For the last three
weeks I have been using a super-petrol, and
have noticed the carburettor stained red. To-
day the heads were lifted, and the mechanic
tells me that my valves are a brownish color
and suggests replacement. I have always bought
the best petrols and oils, and wonder whether
l made a mistake in this case.
Color on valves and carburettor is of no con-
sequence and cannot do any damage. Your
mechanic has never seen it before and is mak-
ing a wild guess. If leaded fuels were harm-
ful to the motor millions of cars still giving
good and faithful service would by now be
on the junk-heap.
W.Mc.L. (Nowra, N.S.W.). —I have recently
taken delivery of an expensive car, and the
agents impress upon me the importance of
driving it quietly for at least 1000 miles. It is
my intention to make a fast straight-through
run to Melbourne almost any day now, and, as
your test gave the maximum speed as 76 m.p.h.,
why should I have to potter along at 30 ?
The car tested had been carefully “run in”
over more than 2000 miles; its bearings were
free and all reciprocating units were carefully
“lapped in.” If you attempt a high-speed run
of any considerable distance with a new car the
motor will never afterwards give its maximum
performance and there will be a distinct pos-
sibility of complete seizure and serious damage
before you get very far.
J.G. (Lilli Pi Hi Point, N.5.W.).—7 had my
1927 Morris-Cowley rebored eighteen months
ago. Although a little faster, she will not pull
as well as before. Have just discovered the
new pistons are {in. below top of cylinder
block. Is this the trouble ?
Standard pistons for 1927 Morris should only
come to within £in. of cylinder block face.
Try fitting a new carburettor, as the S.U. type
after years of use wears slightly in the needle
piston, so that engine suction will not lift the
dome high enough to give full power.
C.W. (Ayr, N.Q.). —After new rings and com-
plete top overhaul my ’29 model Chev. engine
runs beautifully, but a distinct knock has de-
veloped in No. 4 cylinder. If 1 put a thin
piece of tin under the rocker-arm the noise
disappears. Cause and cure ?
Recent top overhaul and fitting new rings
have increased power and found the weak spot.
Tin between rocker-arm and valve lowers com-
pression on that particular cylinder, and if, as
one would suspect, the knock was due to a
loose gudgeon pin, the clatter would then cease
but power would be lost. Advise fitting of
new gudgeon pins and bushes, otherwise trouble
will develop rapidly. Correct inlet-valve clear-
ance for your engine is eight-thousandths.
H.R.T. (Mareeba, Q.). —Would it be
advisable and economical to use power kerosene
at lv. 2d. per gallon instead of benzine at
2s. 2d. per gallon on my 1927 T Ford? What
precautions and adjustments would be neces-
sary ?
Not worth while. You would have to go to
considerable expense in purchasing and fitting
a special carburettor if the engine is to be run
on kerosene.
6-16.—(1) Would / get a better performance
from my car if l shaved a bit off the cylinder-
head, and, if so, how much ? (2) Would an
aluminium head be better, and could one be
obtained as standard fitting ? (3) After revving
up, engine takes a long time to slow down.
Can this be altered ?
(1) Acceleration and maximum speed would
be improved, but slow running and top-gear
pulling would not be so good. Try 3-32 in. off
head; if it is too much, a thick C.A. gasket
will lower compression. (2) An aluminium
head is more efficient, but nothing standard is
available. (3) Try fitting a stronger spring to
the throttle lever.
C.H.R.H. (Serpentine, Vic.). —When I press
the starter pedal in my 1929 A Ford it will
only whirr, and I have to crank up by hand.
Starter ring and pinion are intact, and thread
on shaft has been cleaned and oiled. What’s
wrong ?
Either the battery is almost flat or, more
probably, the spring behind the pinion on the
starter shaft is broken. Try a new spring.
F.W. (Freeling, S.A.). —Where can 1 obtain
spare parts for a Stock Creeper-Track tractor ?
Blaxland, Rae and Co., 63 Salisbury-road,
Camperdown, Sydney. There is no agent in
S.A.
A.E.G. (Cunnamulla, Q.). —Is there a
reasonably priced English car of 10-15 h.p. to
seat five adults, with good clearance, standard
track, maximum speed 50-55 m.p.h., and petrol
consumption of 25 m.p.g. ? If so, name of
agents ?
None with standard track. Nearest approaches
are Cowley Six, track 4ft. 6in. (Howard Motors.
Box 584 J, Brisbane), and 14-lt.p. Vauxhall Light
Six, track 4ft. 4in. (E. G. Eager and Sons,
Valley, Brisbane).
F. 0.8. (Burnie, Tas.). —My car backfires
when going downhill with throttle closed.
Cause ?
Check up tappet clearances. If they arc
correct, look over exhaust line and manifold
gaskets for air-leaks.
P.A.C.P. (Brisbane). —T require new lyres for
my Ford T 8 roadster. Present size is 27 x 5.50.
Should 1 fit 29 x 6.50, or even 31 x 7.00?
Standard equipment is ample size for a road-
ster. Larger sections would tend to make the
car difficult to handle at low speeds.

TUNED R.F. RECEIVERS—WHY NOT?
BY DON B. KNOCK.
During the last six years the superheterodyne receiver has almost eclipsed
the tuned R.F. type for broadcast reception. The reasons are obvious.
The inherent selectivity of the superheterodyne permits easy separation
of stations even with powerful local transmitters in close proximity, and
simplifies, by virtue of its principle, the design of easily operated all-wave
Receivers. The tuned R.F. receiver is worthy of consideration for use in
some country areas for the reason that it can produce a better signal to
noise ratio than the superhet, though it still suffers, in its small diameter
air-cored coil form, from comparative inselectivity. With modern
improvements, incorporating the iron-dust core type of R.F. coils, not
yet manufactured in Australia, it should be possible to design tuned R.F.
receivers of greatly-advanced type, and to apply them, with immediate
advantage, in those places outback where reception of any kind is always
long-distance reception.
Though we live in a world of super-
bets and still more superhets, an assump-
tion that this type of broadcast or all-
wave receiver is a panacea for all radio
ills is not altogether correct.
To argue that the forerunner of the
Australian superhet era, the plain and
simple tuned radio frequency arrange-
ment, is fitted to compete generally with
the highly-efficient superhet of 1934 would
be absurd. With most of the population
of Australia in or close to the cities and
towns where broadcasting stations are
located, the radio designer has had to
cater for the majority. He has been con-
cerned mainly with the question of
station separation, otherwise selectivity ;
and with more and more stations avail-
able on the dial this has become a matter
of paramount importance.
The superhet does the job for which
it is intended, and does it well. Further-
more, by the inclusion of switching, it
is not to-day a difficult process to pro-
duce a superhet capable of taking in the
short-wave as well as the long-wave
bands, and the efficiency of the short-wave
side can be quite high if the designer has
exercised due intelligence.
If the tuned R.F. receiver had been
possessed fundamentally of a high degree
of selectivity between 200 and 600 metres,
there would have been no apparent rea-
son for preference for the superhet, but
with short-wave coverage to be included
in order to provide all-wave reception
the tuned R.F. receiver, with all tuned
circuits operating at the signal frequency,
(Fig. 1)
A n example of the excellent material available to the English
radio home-constructor. This “Permeability Tuner” varies

tuner design, dispensing as it does with variable condensers.
would present a difficult problem. The
logical way of effecting the short-wave
coverage is by using a converter, and the
(Fig. 2)
Circuit diagram of an A.C. 4/5 type tuned R.F.

detector, and resistance-coupled 2A5 pentode output.

combination results in a short-wave
superheterodyne.
But in some parts of the country, well
outback, a well-designed tuned R.F. re-
ceiver is capable of
giving more satis-
factory results than
a modern super-
het, even if the
superhet is actually
a much more sen-
sitive receiver. It
amounts to a ques-
tion of background
noise. In the pro-
cess of frequency
changing and am-
plifying at low fre-
quency (intermedi-
ate frequency) the
R.F. amplification
is so high that on
weak distant sig-
nals the modulated
carrier of a station
is accompanied by
a background of
hissing noise due
to the action of the
valves themselves. If valves were per-
fectly noiseless in action at all frequen-
cies preference for the superhet, anv-
where and everywhere, could not be
challenged.
It is not conjecture on the writer’s part
to say that the tuned R.F. set is definitely
preferable in certain places; it is the re-
sult of personal observations during a
tour over most of the State of N.S.W.
The opinion was formed that the applica-
tion of the tuned R.F. receiver is emi-
nently desirable in such locations as the
Northern Territory, Papua and the
Islands. Some parts of N.S.W., although
far distant from broadcasting centres, are
so blessed with what is termed a “good
radio location” that a strong daylight
signal is in evidence most of the time,
and the whole gamut of stations after
nightfall. In such cases experienced lis-
teners vote for the superhet.
Opinions of Country Listeners.
A listener writes from Tingha, N.S.W.:
From personal experience, and also that
of other enthusiasts in this district, I find that
the tuned R.F. set is not to be compared with
the superhet. The super, is miles above the
T.R.F. in selectivity and sensitivity. It might
be argued that selectivity is not a great factor,
but up here, and in practically every country
district, nearly every station in Australia comes
in at about the same strength. At night-
time any set will pick up about fifty stations,
so what a hopeless jumble the B-class stations
are!
The statement that “in practically every
country district nearly every station in
Australia comes in at about the same
strength” is too sweeping, for in various
locations certain stations, due to geo-
graphical factors, are, although far away,
often infinitely stronger than others
which are much closer. As for the selec-
tivity side of the question in relation to
T.R.F. this is discussed later ; also, many
country listeners are not at all concerned
about small B stations in other districts.
A different opinion comes from Glen
Innes, N.S.W.:
Glad to see that The Bulletin stresses
the advantages of T.R.F. over supers, for cer-
tain country locations. I have built many sets
from the days of crystals, and now have a
Quality Superhet (“A.R.N.” 11/5/’34). This
is an excellent receiver, but even so I con-
sider the tone inferior to a good T.R.F. with
transformer (Ferranti) push-pull output. Static
and electrical interference are severe here. A
modern A.C. T.R.F. set description with
A.V.C., Westinghouse detector, etc., suitable
for the country would be appreciated. 1 would
construct it, and so would many others.
Of many letters received on the sub-
ject a majority of writers favor the
tuned R.F. possibility. Note that the
Glen Innes letter refers to “static and
electrical interference.” Who will deny
that the superhet, by virtue of its very
principle and application, is more prone
thao the T.R.F. to interference from
both sources?
Tuned R.F. Possibilities.
To produce a tuned R.F. receiver which
will be capable of dealing with the R.F.
side efficiently, with an eye to the selec-
tivity problem, special attention must be
paid to the kind of coils used. Experi-
enced radio men know that the coils used
to-day with their small diameters and
small-gauge wire are relatively inefficient,
and that the lack of efficiency is coun-
teracted by making the valves work much
harder thxn is really necessary. The old-
fashioned 3in. diameter coils with space-
wound heavier gauge wire were far more
efficient, but, in the light of the present-
day fashion of compactness, hopelessly
uncommercial. If any receiver, superhet
or T.R.F., were designed to-day with
such coils, the screens would be of un-
wieldy proportions, and the overall size
of the affair something like that of a
coffin ; but, station for station, a much
higher degree of selectivity and sensi-
tivity would be obtained.
E. Maros, of Lismore (N.S.W.), re-
cently tried the effect of large coils in a
tuned R.F. receiver, and observes: —
The T.R.F. set is obsolescent for no apparent
reason. The Josses of modern inductances,
though compensated for in a measure by
modern multi-element valves, can be made valid
again and improved upon. In early days 4in.-
diameter coils with heavy-gauge wire gave really
fine results, and upon trying the combination
of old coil and new valve I have found the
result very pleasing. Anyone possessing a
T.R.F. receiver and desiring improved perform-
ance can obtain it. First remove the present
coils and shields altogether. Obtain the neces-
sary number of bakelite formers, 3£in. diameter
by 2in. long. Wind these with 26-gauge
enamelled wire with 45 turns for the secon-
daries. Using a strip of Empire cloth between.

MORE THAN JUST MAKING VALVES
During the past tep years of radio, more
Mullard Valves have been sold than any other
make. This definitely proves two things:
that Mullard Master Valves must be the
finest radio valves obtainable, and that ten
years’ preference by the radio public has
been maintained by continued research and
experimenting. AVrite for Booklet.

wind over the secondary 20 turns of 28-gauge
wire tapped at the tenth turn for the aerial coil.
The primaries for the R.F. coils have 22 turns
of 34-gauge D.S.C. wire similarly over the
secondaries. Both windings must, of course, be in
the same direction or one will cancel the other.
A visit to the tinsmith is necessary for shielding
cans, and these should be 6in. diameter by 4in.
long, of aluminium. Three will be needed if
the receiver is a 4/5 variety. Secure the coils
centrally in the cans by using pieces of wood
and screws, and suspend them complete, with
wires soldered to respective points and brought
through the shields, under the chassis board,
that is, between the chassis and speaker. See
that the coils are placed underneath their respec-
tive valves, and drill the board to lead the wires
up to the chassis. Solder the wires where they
should go, and retrim the tuning condensers
to the new inductances. If the inductances are
carefully made and the wirings from each are
equal in length, this should present no difficulty.
The transformation of the receiver in improved
power and sensitivity is surprising—it becomes
akin to the modern superhet, but with far less
noise-level.
Such is the opinion, backed by actual
results, of an experienced experimenter,
but naturally such receivers are not likely
to become familiar in the radio stores.
Coils and Future T.R.F. Design.
With the steady advance of radio
science, valves are not the only improved
components, and, overseas, laboratories
have done a great deal with coils. This
Page has referred frequently to the pos-
sibilities of the iron-dust core coils de-
veloped primarily in Europe and de-
scribed as “Ferrocart.” Other than
sample kits for small sets they are not
obtainable in Australia, but they should
be. American engineers have awakened
to their advantages, and are even turn-
ing out superhets with iron-cored coils
throughout. The reports show there is
everything to gain and nothing to. lose
by the use of such coils.
In brief, these coils have all the ad-
vantages of the old-type large coils, plus
the fact that they are even smaller for
a given inductance value than the stand-
ard air-cored coils now in use. They
are thoroughly commercial, and place
within reach much more efficient re-
ceivers of any kind, without extending
the chassis size beyond reasonable limits.
Tn England, receivers using these coils
have been described for some time, with
claims for a good degree of selectivity.
If anybody doubts that selectivity is
necessary there, a radio map of Europe
showing the medley of stations between
200 and 2000 metres will supply the
answer. Some of these stations are of
much higher power than any yet erected
in Australia. It would be possible to
design, with an eye on the requirements
of the Australian outback listener, a
really good T.R.F. receiver with high
gain, sufficient selectivity and A.V.C. if
local manufacturers would do something
about improving inductance design on
the lines indicated.
What is needed is a receiver with at
least three tuned R.F. stages, a detector
of the oxide rectifier type WX Westector,
and, for battery use, Class B, Q.P.P. or
push-pull pentode audio. Should the
essential components become available
the writer will spare no effort to develop
such a receiver and to test it under actual
outback conditions.
A 4/5 A.C. Tuned R.F. Receiver.
There have been many letters asking
for a description of a T.R.F. receiver of
simple design, suitable for use in coun-
try towns where alternating current is

is for the speaker. The chassis is large enough to include another tuned stage if
required.
available. Fig. 2 illustrates the circuit
diagram of such a receiver. This easy-
to-make broadcast receiver is quite a
good performer, and has plenty of signal
gain. Used with a short-wave converter
(B. 1/8/’34) the combination provides
very good all-wave coverage. The key
to the components follows:
C: Standard three-gang variable condenser.
Cl: 3 by .5 mfd. condenser. (Two required.)
C 2: 2 mfd. (Two required.)
C 3 : .01 mfd. (must be mica dielectric).
C 4: .0002 mfd. (mica dielectric).
C 5: 3 by .25 mfd. condenser.
C 6: 25 mfd. dry electrolytic.
C 7: .01 mfd. (mica dielectric).
C 8: 8 mfd. electrolytic filter condensers. (Two
required.)
R 1: 350 ohms,
R 2: 20,000 ohms 1 watt.
R 3: .25 megohms.
R 4: 50,000 ohms 1 watt.
R 5: .5 megohms.
R 6: .1 megohms.
R 7: 15,000-ohm potential divider.
R 8: 2500-ohm potentiometer.
R 9: 400 ohms.
The power transformer is an 80 milli-
ampere type with a 5-volt rectifier wind-
ing at 2 amperes, 2.5-volt heater at 2
amperes, 2.5-volt heater at 6 amperes and
375 volts per side H.T. secondary. The
field of a 2500-ohm dynamic speaker is
the filter choke, as usual.
Fig. 3 shows the completed receiver
viewed from the rear, and the disposition
of valves, coils and condenser gang is
clearly indicated. Although most traders
supplying complete kits or parts for re-
ceivers to-day are concentrating on the
superhet, not all are entirely neglectful
of the tuned R.F. requirement. Messrs.
Fox and MacGillicuddy, Ltd., 57 York-
street, Sydney, are supplying dealers with
the kit for this receiver, and readers can
obtain the complete list of pa'rts from
Cohen and Burrows, Royal Arcade,
Sydney.
There is nothing new or startling about
this T.R.F. model. It is just a remark-
ably good and inexpensive receiver. The
main consideration is that sensitivity is
excellent and selectivity at least sufficient
to separate the local Sydney stations
when the receiver is used anywhere in
the city or outskirts. If it does its job
so well under these conditions it can be
relied upon to give a good performance
elsewhere. It is by no means lacking in
tonal quality. Good music can be pro-
duced by a 2A5 pentode, and with a
tuned R.F. channel ahead of it it will
satisfy extremely critical ears. When
those things that are needed to turn out
ultra-modern tuned R.F. receivers are at
hand, such receivers will be described.
Meanwhile, the unassuming receiver out-
lined here can provide many enjoyable
hours of entertainment.

WHAT TO SAY ABOUT MUSIC.
Exposed as the world is to-day to a
vast flood of music streaming through,
the ether and liable to strike anyone at
any moment, it becomes almost a social
duty to be able to say something chatty
and intelligent or, better still, smart
about the classics, old and new. There
are whole lots of musical pundits better
able to advise on this subject than the
writer, who, if examined on his quali-
fications before a Royal Commission,
would have to say he forgot many things
he never even heard of; but they are
selfish coves, and keep all their really
helpful knowledge to themselves, so that
they may shine brightly on social occa-
sions. The wrong spirit, of course, and
it is to be hoped that after this exposure
they’ll be sorry.
Taking alphabetically the composers
one ought to know something about,
there’s nothing under A but Arensky.
He’s a Russian, and you can safely say
that you don’t like Russians, and that
he’s about the dreariest of the bunch.
Of Bach it is better not to speak dis-
respectfully. He is represented mostly by
fugues that sound like scrambled eggs,
but he’s strongly in fashion. Remark
brightly that he’s a great contrapuntalist.
With Beethoven more latitude is permis-
sible. You’re supposed to be able to
identify the “Moonlight,” “Waldstein,”
“Appassionata,” “Hammerklavier” and
“Pathetique” sonatas by sound, but you’ll
find the printed programme handy if you
can’t. Say, “Ah, the ‘Moonlight’!” or
whatever it is. That’s quite sufficient.
You may add, if someone else is playing
it, that you heard Backhaus do it much
better. All the nine Symphonies should
be treated with respect. Say it’s your
favorite, whatever it is, though most
people are supposed to prefer the Ninth,
otherwise the Choral. If it is anything
but the items beforementioned you can
say that even Beethoven wrote a lot of
tosh, and if ever the multifarious Dia-
belli variations are let loose you can
very truthfully remark that even the
composer regarded them with shudder-
ing aversion in later life. On Brahms
yq.u can take an independent stand. If
you say he is a confirmed plagiarist, with
nothing of his own to say, you’ll have
at least one great contemporary critic
on your side, and if you say he “weaves
a richer texture” than all the rest of
them put together you’ll still be in sound
company. Borodin is a Russian. It’s
safest not to like Russians, and let him go
at that. If Bizet’s “Carmen” comes along
point out the music isn’t Spanish. If you
get a chance praise Bela Bartok, a Hun-
garian pianist-composer (very modernist)
who has been making a hit in London
lately.
Chopin, though his fame is a little on
the decline, is still set among the immor-
tals. Say you love his mazurkas best.
They all sound alike to most of us; but
Liszt said they were a rich mine of pure
gold. Coleridge-Taylor, don’t forget,
was a nigger but also a Britisher, and he
has nothing to do with jazz. You can
praise some of his work unstintedly and
not feel a liar while doing so. Chamin-
ade is a lady, and if you say her work is
full of feminine grace you’ll pass.
Debussy, no matter how much you
don’t understand what he’s driving at,
must be referred to as a wonderful
creator of atmosphere. Delius isn’t a
Finn like Sibelius, but an English com-'
poser. Rate him as fresh and dainty.
De Falla, a Spaniard and a modernist,
can be called Falla without the “de.”
He got his themes mostly from Moorish
sources and his technique from Debussy
and Ravel, and he sounds like a series
of disasters. Say what you like about
him. Delibes you won’t have any trouble
in praising, and you can go to it; he’s
the prettiest writer of dance music since
the younger Strauss rolled in his marble.
Dvorak’s “Humoreske” should be slated,
no matter how much you like it, but give
his “New World Symphony” (which
you’ll detest) your strong appreciation.
Grieg is a Scandy with a Scotch
strain. Remark on his freshness and
originality, and deplore the fact that so
many people spell him wrong. Glinka
is a Russian. You don’t like Russians.
Handel may still be moderately ap-
proved. Liszt is also known as the Abbe,
and he really did take holy orders to
escape a princess who wanted to marry
him. Curb your delight in his “Rigo-
letto” transcription, and state firmly that

his only really great work was the “Faust
Symphony.”
It’s the fashion to abuse Mendelssohn ;
too sentimental and sugary. Mozart
gains .ground ; praise his “inimitable deli-
cacy of outline”—it doesn’t mean any-
thing, but it will serve. MacDowell
was an American, but none the worse
for that. He didn’t write jazz, and he
had an alias, “Edgar Thorn.” Praise
him for his poetic insight! Moszkowski
is a German, not a Russ. Not a first-
classer, but he wrote well for the piano,
and it’s safe to say so. Mossourgsky can
be called the greatest of the Russians,
but you still don’t like them.
Rubinstein, Rachmaninoff (still alive) and
Rimsky-Korsakov are Russians; so you
needn’t worry about them, except to re-
member that you know Rachmaninoff’s
Prelude in C Sharp Minor, and that it
suggests to you an elephant chasing a
wasp after being stung and trampling it
fatally dead. Ravel is a French modern-
ist, regarding whom you can have an
open slather. He has few friends in Aus-
tralia. Max Reger must be referred to
as a musician’s musician, which means
that very few care for him.
Schubert, an Austrian, was best at
short tunes, and you may suggest that’s
why his best-known Symphony is un-
finished. It wasn’t cut short by death.
Remember he didn’t write “L’Adieu,”
usually ascribed to him, which is by Reis-
seiger. .Schumann, a German, went mad.
He was addicted to cigars and fond of
children. If you say that at his best
you prefer him to Chopin it will sound
well. Sibelius, the Finn, can be praised
for his freshness and originality (see
Grieg), but is not of Scotch extraction.
Of Strausses there are four, and they
mustn’t be mixed. Johann, the elder,
wrote waltzes, now seldom played;
Johann, his son, wrote the “Blue Dan-
ube.” Beethoven liked both composers,
and so do you, so you can be honest and
say so. Richard Strauss, one of the older
moderns, used to be regarded as very
daring, but he quite frequently evolved
a tune. You can say he sounds a bit
faded. Straus, with one “s,” wrote
“Chocolate Soldier” and “A Waltz
Dream.” The pundits sneer at him,
but don’t join in. Be honest and say you
enjoy his music, and the pundits will
secretly respect you.
Tschaikowsky is a Russian. You’re
supposed to know the “Nutcracker” suite
(“Casse Noisette”) and the “1812” Over-
ture. You still don’t like Russians.
You’ll have to admit Wagner was a mar-
vellous instrumentalist, and pretend you
adore “The Ring,” but don’t say much
on the subject or you’ll get into deep
water. Applaud anything by Vaughan
Williams, modern English composer and
very much the fashion. There aren’t
any Xs, Ys or Zs worth worrying about.
THE LYRE.
Country Short-wave Explorations.
A new station which will be perma-
nent is the Bombay transmitter on 31.2
metres. From WBXK the writer learns
that the callsign is VUB, but during sub-
sequent reception of the Bombay station
no announcement of callsign was heard.
The strength and quality are excellent,
but the hours are inconvenient for Aus-
tralian listeners, apart from W.A., the
programme commencing at midnight,
S.M.T., and closing at 3.30 a.m. The
days of transmission appear to be
Wednesday, Saturday and Monday.
Recently during mid-week most sig-
nals have been weak and static heavy
above 31 metres. GSB, 31.5 metres, has
been remarkably strong after 5 p.m.,
with GSD well behind. The echo tests
have been continued, and several echoes
have been observed here. On a Sunday
several interesting transmissions were
noted. The foreigner previously reported
in the 31-metre band has reappeared at
a different hour. This station is now defi-
nitely identified as YV3BC, with fre-
quency announced as 9505 kc. The Eng-
lish session was difficult to interpret
owing to the announcer’s accent, plus
high-speed fading.
The League of Nations station, HBL,
was audible at 8.30 a.m., but almost un-
decipherable, and it seems likely this
signal will disappear until next winter.
RNE Moscow was good strength at 9
p.m., and the midnight session excel-
lent, with a really fine musical pro-
gramme. At 2 p.m., WBXK was hard to
copy owing to high noise level, but some
interesting things were heard, chief
among which was the announcement
that W2BW was to transmit a special
programme for M.L. and Australia on
the following day (Monday here) on
4285 kc. This frequency is (in wave-
length) just below the amateur 80-metre
band. The time of transmission was
from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m., S.M.T., and the
signal was not audible here. WBXK also
reported that the Bombay station is well
heard in U.S.A.
RVIS has again been strong in be-
tween atmospherics, but the D.E.I. sta
tions in the 49-metre band were not up
to the previous week. On Sept. 16 the
80-metre amateur band was back to mid-
winter behavior, with M.L. amateurs
full speaker volume and good signals
from W.A. and Broken Hill (N.S.W.).
Between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. the 40-
metre amateur band has been very lively,
but signals are practically non-existent
before noon. Several Victorians were
heard with good musical transmissions.
Manila, P. 1., has been too weak to enjoy
at night-time, but, based on previous
summer experience, should improve
shortly. This applies also to the Ameri-
cans in the 31-metre band.
NIGHTOWL.
What’s What in Radio.
Television as a home constructor’s
hobby is gaining ground in England.
Transmissions by 8.8. C. and Bairds are
not wasted, for scanning discs whirl and
cathode-ray tubes flicker nightly in a
large number of private laboratories. In
Australia a very small number of experi-
menters has dabbled with scanning
discs, and, though television may have
been accomplished, the feat has not
added to knowledge. Development in
television must be along lines dispensing
with moving mechanical parts of syn-
chronisation, without sacrifice of picture
definition.

Marconi recently demonstrated the
latest application of “micro” radio waves.
The apparatus is designed for the navi-
gation of ships into a harbor by radio
control, and is akin to the system used
in aviation. The experiments were car-
ried out on the laboratory-ship Elettra,
with signals transmitted by a land station,
using a wave-length of 60 centimetres.
The pilot relied upon these signals alone
to maintain the course, and indicators
showed any deviation to port or star-
board. The immediate advantage of
these very short waves is that radio im-
pulses at such high frequencies are not
affected by fog, atmospherics or mag-
netic storms.
* * * *
While the radio engineers of the
world are producing radio waves of in-
creasingly high frequency a technician
at the U.S.S.R. Academy of Science has
been working in the opposite relation.
He asserted that in the process of think-
ing the human brain emits radio waves
of a length of approximately 3,000,000
metres. An Italian neurologist has
pronounced this correct. A power-
ful receiver tuned to this wave-
length was placed in a screened room
and a student invited to sit within
and to think of a number of listed
articles. Whenever the student thought
of any particular object a sound was
heard in the headphones entirely differ-
ent from the sound produced when he
thought of something else. Presently
the neurologist was able to state
accurately the thoughts of the stu-
dent by noting the sounds heard. But
he found that the thought-sound pro-
duced by other students was different
from that of the first student when the
thought-subject was the same, so here is
no royal road to mind-reading.

“R 9” and “Radio” (U.S.A.) Subscriptions.
The publishers of the monthly amateur
magazine “R 9,” with H.Q. at 1455 Glen-
ville Drive, Los Angeles, California
(U.S.A.), announce that the overseas rate
on “R 9” is raised from 2 dollars to 2
dollars 25 cents for one year; and on a
two-year subscription from 3 dollars 75
cents to 4 dollars. There are no changes
in the rates of “Radio” alone. On the
combination of “R 9” and “Radio” the
rate is 4 dollars 75 cents for one year or
8 dollars 50 cents for two years. The
change in rate is made necessary by the
fact that “R 9” is to be considerably in-
creased in size, commencing with the
November, 1934, issue, involving an in-
crease in mailing costs. This announce-
ment, therefore, supersedes the adver-
tisements in The Bulletin on 19/9/’34
and 26/9/’34.
The Q. and A. Column.
My seven-valve superhet is an early 1933
Kreisler model. Tone and selectivity are satis-
factory, but 1 am unable to get reception until
after nightfall. I am approximately SUU miles
from the nearest broadcasting station, but recep-
tion generally is good in this part of Queens-
land. —139.
Such a receiver should give you daylight
reception. Valves should be checked over
firstly, and the receiver tested and relined. Pos-
sibly the intermediate-frequency transformers
need repeaking, and by this time moisture may
have aifected the setting of the mica compres-
sion condensers. If you feel competent to
attend to this yourself, use a wooden screw-
driver or a bone knitting-needle sharpened to
fit the trimmer slots, and make the adjustment
very carefully on a steady non-l'ading signal.
A touch either way should be all that is
required.
Receiver, five-valve superhet, 460/cc.; circuit
and layout enclosed. During day, reception
good. Some nights, reception good. Distortion
frequently very bad, and seems worse when
volume is reduced. Maker stated trouble was
due to overloading of second detector, so
replaced 10,000-ohm resistor by 15,000 with
no improvement. Consider distortion cannot
be due to overloading, because distortion
occurs when local switch is used and volume
full on for stations. What’s the remedy ? —l4O.
According to the diagram the trouble is in
the 58 intermediate-frequency amplifier. Here
you have a 15,000-ohm cathode resistor, with
a 10,000-ohm potentiometer in parallel to earth
and bridged by the .1 mfd. by-pass condenser.
Remove the 15,000-ohm resistor between
cathode and earth, and connect a 300- or 350-
ohm resistor in series with the cathode and the
10,000-ohm potentiometer. The volume con-
trol can then function normally, and the 350-
ohm resistor ensures that the valve has its
normal bias at full volume.
Is it possible to use coils suitable for the
broadcast band with the Daventry Four
(“A.R.N.” 29/12/’33). ? The tuning condensers
lam using are Gecophone vernier type. If I
made a switching arrangement to increase the
capacity by shunting .00025 mfd. fixed con-
densers, would this be satisfactory ? —142.
If your tuning condenser has a capacity of
approximately .000175 mfd. the broadcast band
can be covered by using a grid coil with 155
turns of 36 D.S.C. with a primary reaction coil
of 35 to 40 turns of the same gauge on a
Marquis former. Switching shunt capacities
would merely raise the minimum capacity, and
would not effect the coverage intended. In
using a receiver intended for both short waves
and broadcast coverage, the Efco split-stator
variable condenser is particularly useful. You
refer to condensers, but this receiver had an
untuned R.F. stage with only the one tuning
condenser, with potentiometer regeneration
control.
What is the capacity of the timing condenser
in the portable signal generator (B. 12/9/’34) ?
This was overlooked in marking the diagram.
The capacity is .0005 mfd.
Noticing references to 28-megacycle (iO-
metre) reception and transmission, and having
a good short-wave receiver which goes to i 5
metres or so, 1 am wondering if it will be
worth while making coils for this band. Is
there anything to listen to ? —143.
From the average short-wave listener’s view-
point, the 10-metre band at present is of no
attraction. Reception over distances exceed-
ing 30 miles or so is extremely erratic and
unreliable, but occasionally amateurs do some
good reasonable - distance communication,
mostly by telegraphy. At present in Sydney,
experimental station VK2LZ is testing telephony
on 10 metres, and may be heard strongly
locally. Apart from the possibility of hearing
this station, and a few other amateurs adjust-
ing telegraphy transmitters in readiness for a
contest, you will hear merely a few weak
harmonics. The laws of wave reflection are
such, however, that the 10-mctre band may
at any time spring to life.
Are the type of aerials described as "trans-
posed-feeder doublets” all they are claimed to
be for short-wave reception in the matter of
reduction of electrical interference ? —144.
Depends upon how the aerial is used. The
noise picked up from electrical sources by the
average aerial is almost always via the lead-in
and not the aerial itself. By using transposed
or twisted feeders to a doublet-type aerial,
much of this noise may be eliminated if the
aerial itself is well removed from the zone ol
interference. Furthermore, this filtering effect
is only in evidence at the natural frequency
of the aerial itself. A great deal depends also
upon how the aerial is connected to the
receiver, and the coupling should be entirely
inductive and not capacitative. R. C. A.
Victor, U.S.A., recently marketed an interest-
ing double-doublet for all-wave receivers, and
reports from users are extremely satisfactory.

Back to Darlinghurst Week.
“S. Esq.”: There was a representative
gathering of former residents at the
Back to Darlinghurst celebrations. The
Long Bay authorities kindly allowed
many old identities to make the trip.
Mr. “Gasher” Sharpe, at great per-
sonal inconvenience, travelled incog, all
the way from Fitzroy, his present home,
to open the festivities. It will be remem-
bered that Mr. Sharpe left Darlinghurst
shortly after the Consorting Act was
introduced. Until then he was acknow-
ledged champion slasher of the State.
Amidst loud applause he presented the
committee with a souvenir of his visit—
the razor with which he won the final
of the celebrated Riley-street feud.
The sporting items were well patron-
ised. The Cocaine Consumers’ Cup was
won by Danny (“Snow”) Dope, and
other popular events were Dodging the
Landlord, Throwing the Party and Run-
ning the Midnight Club.
A monument was unveiled at the spot
where the suburb’s first gun duel took
place, and among interesting exhibits
on show were the rope used to hang
“Sureshot” Potts, the biggest collection
of empties ever seen in the Southern
Hemisphere and several secret doors
used by famous ex-patrons of the drug
trade.
The festivities ended with a very enjoy-
able fight under choose-your-own-
weapon rules. The police provided free
transport for most of the contestants.

Dangerous Trait.
“Keo”: The doctor was giving instruc-
tions to the nurse.
“Under no circumstances,” he said, in-
dicating a bed where a patient lay with
both arms in splints, “must relatives or
friends be allowed to converse with this
man. And you must also see that he
doesn’t talk with near-by patients. A
couple of ‘greensticks’ are bad enough
to set once without having to fix them
a second time.”
“But how” the nurse began.
The doctor was brusque.
“Just have a look at the name,” he
said shortly.
She glanced at the chart over the
patient’s bed.
The name was Cohen!
—4
Relief.
“Nat”: He crept into the slum cot-
tage, the picture of despair. Pushing
some dole rations to one side of the bed,
he sank down.
What a life! Two years ago he had
lost his job. Gradually his savings had
been exhausted ; one by one he had sold
his possessions ; and now he and his wife
were reduced to poverty, deserted by
their former friends, despondent, hope-
less.
To-day, in a desperate gamble with
fate, he had bet his last five shillings on
a horse —and lost.
“One more setback,” he muttered,
“and I’ll end it!”
On the pillow beside him he glimpsed
a note in his wife’s handwriting. As he
read it his face became contorted with
shock.
“Dear Ben,” it ran, “I can stand this
poverty no longer. I’m clearing out with
another man. Good-bye.”
He stared upwards, a peculiar excite-
ment in his eyes.
“Thank heavens!” he shouted. “My
luck’s changed at last!”

The Player-Writer.
“London Institute of Journalists has passed
a resolution deploring the practice of engaging
cricketers, footballers, tennis-players and
golfers to describe games, as it creates an im-
pression that sporting journalists are incom-
petent.” — Cable.
“V<e Victis” objects:
The resolution went on to urge the M.C.C.
and other amateur bodies to deal with e
sporting journalists’ rivals; and “the opinion
was expressed that the attention of
unions, where they are existent, should e
directed to such ‘blacklegging.’ ”
The average sporting journalist is incom-
petent compared with the average person
who is employed by a newspaper because o
his, or her, performances at a particular sport.
Who wants to read the views about cricket ot
old Rabbit, who hasn’t wielded a bat since he
played for the second eleven of his school be-
fore the war, when the views of Jardine are
available? It is the same in every field. Arnolo
Bennett was one of the most helpful critics
that ever reviewed novels in a London daily
paper; he knew about novel-writing from per-
sonal experience. There has never been an
English art critic who wrote more beautifully
than Ruskin, and there has been none who
pronounced so many wrong judgments; he
knew little of art but its jargon.
The claim is made that a unionist has a
right to preference in employment just because
he is a unionist, and irrespective of considera-
tions such as that a non-unionist may be better
qualified, or may be a wounded ex-soldier to
whom the community is under a moral obliga-
tion. The community which pays for services
rendered has a right either to the utmost value
for its money or to the knowledge that, in
paying for something less than the best, it is
discharging a patriotic debt.


SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
The A.J.C. was well satisfied with the
attendance (60,000-odd) at Randwick on
Saturday, and the people saw brilliant
racing for their money. But, though
favorites won both divisions of the Trial
Stakes, it was a bookmakers’ day. Silver
King was downed in the Derby and
Chatham in the Epsom; the Hurdle
Race and the divided Kensington Han-
dicap went to long-price candidates. The
tote figures were up considerably:
£68,129 compared with £50,556 a year
ago and £48,562 on the corresponding
day in 1932.
McShortodds would have made a lot
more than he did on the Derby had he
been prepared to take a bit of a chance
with Silver King. He demanded odds
—ll to B—though8—though the El Cacique colt
was palpably no Phar Lap. Theo was
next in order at 7 to 1 ; Gladswood, at
the same price early, eased to tens, the
same as Duke Caledon.
Webb, Silver King’s jockey, took him
to the front and tried to lead all the
way. As he shot into the straight ahead
of Dark Sky, Theo and Sylvandale, it
looked as if he might do it, but too much
had been taken out of him. Game
enough, he raised another effort when
Theo tackled him, but McCarten was
Bert/'Whats the matter? Is vt
COL.D ? "
Qert". "Oh, h-m-no v .
Bert 1 'Vieu_, what are you

<sert scalded MV toot''
equal to the occasion. Finishing with
determination, Theo beat Silver King by
half a length, with the Victorian Dark
Sky, a supposed non-stayer, a length and
a half away, Sylvandale fourth and
Gladswood fifth. Gladswood would have
been closer but for being repeatedly
checked in the early stages. He seems a
pig-headed brute.
Ned Moss owns and Fred Williams
trains Theo, who is by Limond —Mira-
belle 11, and was bought as a yearling
for 650 guineas. Theo is now being
hailed as a strong opponent for Peter
Pan in the Melbourne Cup, but this
Page’s impression is that the three-year-
olds are not of much account this year.
Ned Moss also owns Sir John, who was
superior to Theo as a two-year-old. Sir
John was backed for the second division
of the Kensington Handicap, but failed
rather ingloriously.
The Epsom was a much better bet-
ting race. It was 4 to 1 the field
(Chatham and Australia Fair were joint
favorites); 12 to 1 bar one. Silver Ring,
trained by former jockey Dick King,
who had Pilliewinkie, was one of five
at 14 to 1. Bounced out of the barrier
smartly by Jim Munro, and in a good
position all the way, he landed the
money, but in another stride Dermid
(25 to 1) was in front. Australia Fair
was third, three-quarters of a length
away ; he lost ground at the top of the
straight through being forced wide, and
was lugging out most of the journey.
Chatham was anchored by his weight;
Pike did not knock him about over the
last furlong. Closing Time (fourth) was
always in the picture, and Version sur-
prised by beating many better-backed
candidates. Whittingham could not go
the pace in the early stages, but Lough
Neagh shaped fairly. Golden Wings was
last.
Jim Munro had scored in the Epsom
on Amounis twice, and on Boaster when
that gelding and Metellus dead-heated
in 1925. Dermid passed eight or nine
horses in the straight; Webb rode him,
and was most unlucky not to win at least
one of the big races.
The Spring Stakes saw Rogilla (2 to 1)
prove superior to Peter Pan on the day,
with Oro a fair third. Darby Munro got
in the last run on Pike. However,
Peter Pan was in a bad mood ; he kicked
out at the barrier, pulled hard and made
a wild dash over to the rails in the
straight, interfering badly with Limarch.
This caught the stewards’ eye, and Pike
will have to stand down for two months.
Limarch was almost knocked over the
fence, and pulled up lame.
In the first division of the Trial Stakes
Senior (2 to 1) followed up his Hawkes-
bury victory by finishing too strongly
for Babili, with Upoko Ariki third.
Mainlaw (6 to 4) won the second heat in
a manner that suggested more victories ;
though slow away, he had the race in his
keeping from the Leger. High Cross
battled on gamely to get second prize,
and Lancaster King did well to run third,
as he was checked at the six furlongs
and lost lengths.
A few people had a good win on
Gothlin in the first heat of the Kensing-
ton Handicap. The son of Gothic, who
is raced by a man in the wholesale
tobacco trade, was backed from twenties
to eights. Cabalist and Wollun filled the
places; the favorite, Buonarroti, after
leading for home, ran fourth. The
second division went to Matt Sawyer’s
horse Kagal (10 to 1). Sir John was the
early favorite, but at the close of betting
Frimsel and High Boy joined him at
sixes. Cynical made a great effort to
run down Kagal, but the latter was too
solid in the run home. Omagh and
Royal Bird ran a dead heat for third.
Times were good, though in no case
startling. Silver Ring ran his mile in
lmin. 36|sec. Theo traversed the Derby
distance in 2min. 32|sec. ; Rogilla cut the
|sec. off.
The weather was summery on Satur-
day, wintry on Monday. It cleared up
before the Metrop. was run, but the
bitter wind and driving rain kept many
away. Followers of Frank McGrath’s
stable got a bit of their own back when
Australia Fair (9 to 4) came with a con-
quering run in' the Shorts. He left it
pretty late: Mafoota (15 to 1) was only
half a neck away when the judge and his
assistants showed the numbers; Roman
Spear (7 to 1) was a good third.
One for the punters ; but the Ring was
avenged in the Breeders’ Plate, for Wise
Boy (10 to 1) hit the front almost at
once and was never afterwards headed.
He is a bay colt by Treclare—Wiseacre,
trained by. Chaffe. Better-backed young-
sters in Rembrandt (7 to 1) and Latharna
(5 to 1) followed him home.
The Metrop. was worth braving the
blast for. Finer fields have been seen in
the historic race, but a more exciting
finish never. Oro was a firm favorite at
threes, and late money for Nightly sent'
that rather unlucky Maorilander to fives.
Braeburn and Journal were firm at eights,
but Waikare went to tens and Topical
to twenties. Topical’s drift was under-
standable, for the track did not suit him ;
but Waikare’s price was a surprise.
lolaus led for. four or five furlongs ; then
Oro took up the running. “It’s all
over!” the favorite’s backers shouted
when, with six furlongs to go, he bowled
along clear of Broccoli, lolaus and Dark
Chief; at this stage Waikare was nearer
last than first. Making the home turn
Dark Chief (40 to 1) and Sarcherie (16
to 1) closed on Oro, and he turned it up.
For a brief space Sarcherie seemed likely
to furnish a surprise; then Journal,
Waikare and Nightly came with fast runs
and fought out a grand finish. Only the
judge could separate them, and he de-
clared for Waikare, Journal, Nightly and
Sarcherie in that order, with only heads
between. Oro and Dark Chief were
next ;• Braeburn faded just when he was
expected to come on. The time was
2min. 49£sec.
Waikare, like Theo and Silver Ring,
was bred in M.L.; he is a four-year-old
bay stallion by Limond —Waterwings.
George Price trains him for E. J. Watt,
now a member of the A.J.C. committee,
and Pratt rode a splendid race.
* * * *
Sorrowful was the display of Marabou
in the Merri Trial Handicap at Moonee
Valley. This Marconigram colt is a
first acceptor for the Victoria Derby, and
early in the week the Farndale-Marabou
double was backed for the two Cups to
win £25,000. Farndale is a stable-com-
panion of Marabou; their trainer is
Lou Robertson. Punters sent Marabou
out at 6 to 4. No doubt he needs plenty
of galloping room, and perhaps he was
unsuited by the 91-furlong track ; any-
way, he failed badly.
Success went to The Monarch, a West-
ern District four-year-old, ridden by
Dempsey. Last off, The Monarch
gathered in the leaders at the two-fur-
long pole and scored, running away.
He was nominated for both the Caulfield
Cup and Melbourne Cup, but did not
survive first acceptances.
Farndale met with a measure of sup-
port for the Quality Handicap. He
never threatened danger.
Ruach started favorite for the middle-
distance Tullamarine Handicap, and won
on a protest. Entering the home stretch
Sordino shifted out and collided with
Ruach, who lost balance and hung in
when the jockey pulled out his whip.
Sordino scored by half a length. It took
the stewards a long while to arrive at
a determination, tote and ring bets being
held up meanwhile. Ruach belongs to
“S. A. Rawdon,” who breeds on an ex-
tensive scale.
Waltzing Lily did not run in the
Quality Handicap; Ashley Reed, her
usual pilot, was away in Sydney. Prob-
ably because the track was wet Holt
withdrew Hall Mark. Punters made
Double Bard their first choice, but
Double Bard ruined his chance by mis-
behavior at the start. Great Don (12 to
1) cut down the pacemakers, Dark Look
and Vauntry, and scored by a substan-
tial margin. It now seems as if sprinting
is his forte. Looking a trifle burly, but
very handsome, Kuvera was fifth.
(Continued on page 36.)
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
About the best wrestling yet seen at
Sydney Stadium was staged when Jack
Clarke met Wong Bock Cheung and Bill
Beth opposed Oki Shikina in six-round
matches. Shikina, much speedier than
Beth, scored a fall with a leg-lock, but
the American’s forward slam, then press,
pinned the Japanese in the fourth, and
again in the fifth. Clarke always seemed
superior to Cheung, and back-slammed
him for a fall in 48 seconds of the fourth,
But the Celestial’s slam scored for him
in, the sixth, and their debate was de-
clared a draw.
Ins and* Outs
Last week Don Bradman had to be
rushed to a London hospital and operated
on for appendicitis. The operation
showed a ruptured appendix, and pre-
sently peritonitis set in; for days it was
touch and go. Latest reports indicate
that the great batsman is well on the road
to recovery. Bradman will not play the
coming season, but it is expected that
the future will see him free of the ten-
dency to the rather mysterious illnesses
which have been dogging him for a long
time.

The N.vS.W. grade cricket season
opened uneventfully on Saturday on
wickets that were not really ready for
the most part. Nothing very startling
happened save a dashing innings of 153
for Paddington against Uni. by Griffin.
The next highest score for his side was
15. He is a left-hander. Chilvers made
a good bowling start for Northern Dis-
trict, taking nine St. George wickets for
46. The ex-North Shore Grammar boy
H. Chapman kicked off well for Uni.,
outing seven Paddingtonians for 85. He
bowls right-hand medium stuff with a
good swing.

Footbrawl
Vic. League’s second semi-final between
Richmond and Geelong was played at
Melbourne mostly in rain and mud. The
Hubbites promised an interesting go up
to half-time, but the continuous down-
pour got them down, and they lost hope
and slopped along to dull, drab disaster.
The third quarter saw Richmond, in a
succession of slogging crushes, climb
definitely on top. The bumping suited
the heavier and stronger Tigers, but was
of no earthly use to Geelong ; but there
was no possibility of clean, open play,
with good marking and systematic pass-
ing. So, while the rain-soaked crowd
slipped away home, the Pivotorians
just drifted along to a despairing finish,
Richmond winning with 19 goals 20 be-
lli nds (134 points) to Geelong’s 7 goals
8 behinds (50 points). Given a fine, dry
day, Geelong may put up a decent fight
with South Melbourne next Saturday, but
the solid, bumping game is no good to
it. Richmond’s backs—Bolger, Bag-
gott, O’Neill—were the mainstay of the
side, and Martin, roving, Harris and
Baxter, forward, did well. For Geelong,
Quinn, roving, Collins and Evans shone
at times. Rain kept the attendance down
to 35,934 and the takings to £1661,
though the League will collect £lOOO
insurance against wetness.
R. H. Bettington walked off with the
champion of club championships on
Saturday at Manly, doing the 36 holes of
stroke in 75, 73 —148. Young Waterson,
of Moore Park, was only a point behind.
Jim Ferrier ran third with 151. In Mel-
bourne the Victorian professional cham-
pionship went to G. Naismith, of Rivers-
dale, who beat Boorer, of Woodlands,
9 up and 8 at Kingston Heath. Naismith
won the title in 1932.

"D.E.”: Name the best three-year-old
that ever won the A.J.C. Derby! Ninety-
nine per cent, of racegoers would answer
‘Phar Lap.” Phar Lap was great at
lour years, and greater still at five ; but,
raw, leggy fellow that he was in the
spring of 1929, was he equal to Man-
lied at the Derby age? I will never
think it. Amounis beat him tw'ice at
w.f.a. He was a bit above himself on
both occasions, but a beating is a beat-
ing. Amounis, fit as a fiddle, was in
the A.J.C. Derby race of 1925 ; Manfred
gave him half-a-furlong start and a bad
licking. Experienced men had their stop-
watches on the beautiful but wayward
son of Valais —Otford when he decided
to go in pursuit of the field ; they timed
him to run the 12 furlongs in 2min. 29sec.
That same year, injudiciously ridden, he
ran second to Windbag in the fastest
Melbourne Cup race on record ; Phar
Lap, also injudiciously ridden, but with
21b. less, was third to Nightmarch (decid-
edly inferior to Windbag) and Paquito
in a race slower by 3|sec. As a four-
year-old, Manfred, with 9st. 61b., donkey-
licked a good Caulfield Cup field in 2min.
32|sec., the race being over from the
time he condescended to leave the post;
at the same age Phar Lap won the Mel-
bourne Cup with 61b. more, but took
3mm. 27|sec. to compass the two miles.
Because of his habits, the turf never saw
the fully-developed Manfred at his best;
but even so he proved himself a wonder.
Ins and Outs
‘Brass Addler”: As usual when an
Australian Eleven is returning, the States
are gathering round with watering chops
and wondering what their cut will be.
One of the Queensland members of the

shouting when he announced on his
return from Melbourne that Banana-
land’s whack would be over £3OOO. The
Q.C.A. needs the money. It needs new
blood more.

“Hotham : Victorian cricket enthusi-
asts will welcome back to grade
cricket this season that great batsman
lack Ryder. The Bumbles of Col-
lingwood chased the 40-year-old C.C.C.
off its ground last year owing to a dis-
pute as to how long the belated foot-
ballers were to be allowed to cut up the
wicket. The result is that the famous old
club could find no playing area and stood
down for the season. Collingwood Coun-
cil has crawled down, and the club is
opening at the old address. In his prime
Ryder was one of the finest forcing
batsmen in Australia and a fast-medium
bowler of class. In 28 Test innings he
averaged 44.16 with a h.s. of 201 n.o.

“Fitzcray”: It almost seems incredible,
but when the Board of Control lately had
before it the question of reimbursing
Woodfull for his travelling expenses as
an Australian selector —one trip was
to Brisbane —it postponed the matter,
though it is nearly a year since Woodfull
dipped into his own pocket for the
money. The board has been almost as
dilatory in returning to the team it picked
last season for M.L., and then pushed
through the window, the money the
selected men spent on extra gear for the
long trip. Queensland has done the decent
thing by paying the men itself, but several
who can ill afford it are still whistling
for their coin.
* * *.
“Cover”: Something new in cricket
administration was suggested at a recent
meeting of the N.S.W.C.A. A delegate
moved that the association should
take out an insurance policy to
cover all affiliated clubs against
third-party risks. Some of the municipal
cricket grounds round Sydney insist on
a third-party ’ clause being incorpor-
ated in their leases. It is a sound idea,
tor injuries to spectators from cricket
balls and other causes attaching to the
game are fairly common, with a fatality
cropping up occasionally.
* * * *
Susie Swattit”: Ominous news has
reached me that the women cricketers
aren t finding it easy to rake in the cash
v* r c English team to the
Ma State. Matches are being arranged,
and there is talk of issuing collecting-lists.
So, if your office is invaded one of these
mornings by a healthy-looking, sun-
browned girl with a “Gimmee” look in
her eye, either jump out of the window
or part up like a little man.
* * * *
Newlands”: Leaving out the minor
matches, the Australian itinerary in
South Africa lor 1935-36 has been defi-
nitely fixed. There will be five Tests:
two at Jo burg, two at Capetown and one
at Durban, the Durban match beginning
December 14. Unless Australia makes
some miraculous discoveries, 1 don’t
fancy we shall find the Afrikanders easy
marks. Indeed, considering conditions
at the present moment, we haven’t
got half a team. A fast bowler is essen-
tial lor South Africa, but there isn’t one
in sight. Grimmett, O’Reilly and Fleet-
wood-Smith, with the help of McCabe
and Chipperfield,will again have to do the
work. Heaven pity the first two! They
were bowled blind in temperate England.
How they will fare in the rarefied air
No, Mr. Phyzgigge—I never pulled a ’orse in me life, an’ I ain’t gointa start now ”
of the High Veld, 7000 ft. above sea-level,
and in the middle of a blazing South
African summer isn’t nice to think of.

“S.T.S.”: Arthur Richardson, the old
cricket international, writes to Adelaide
that he is in the West Indies, coaching a
Trinidad club jointly with another at
Georgetown, British Guiana. He has also
been making a good thing out of articles
in English newspapers, so the falling-out
with his old Lancashire club does not
worry him at all. With South African
visits thrown in, Arthur has had 18 con-
secutive seasons of cricket, and has not
seen, winter since 1925. His West Indian
contract is for two years. After that he
intends to have another look at Australia.
* * * *
“Aigburth”: Jardine in his latest book,
“Ashes —And Dust,” asserts that the
epithets hurled at his team by Australian
crowds were “unprintable.” Writer has
known Sydney “Hill” for many years and
has a fair acquaintance with the Mel-
bourne outer —for Adelaide he refuses to
vouch. In all that time he has never
heard a foul or obscene epithet used by
the crowd.
*£❖ - #
“Der Jong”: South African cricket
is showing signs of falling away from
grace. As sportsmen the Afrikanders
were never a pot-hunting crowd. In the
past the wickets there were not covered.
The fact that most of them were mat-
ting on mud or even on grass where it
existed, as at Capetown, may have had
something to do with this. I understand
that most of the big centres have now
turf wickets. This has induced the S.A.
heads to ask the Australian Board of
Control if it will agree to the wickets
being completely covered. One thing is
that most of the Australian tour will
embrace the S.A. wet season, which
really is wet', and Australia will probably
consent.

“Ibn el Jssar”: Even a Nawab has to
come off his horse. The Nawab of
Pataudi, when he qualified for Wor-
cestershire and had played for England,
told the world that he would never play
for his native India, since that would
cut him out of his beloved English
cricket. He has now announced that if
invited he will play for India in 1936,
which means that he will always do so
in future. The Nawab has been a longish
time from his own country. The Raj
doesn t fancy even minor potentates who
neglect their home duties, and it is odds
on that H.H. has been informed that it
was high time he got back to the cactus.
The Nineteenth Hole
Shirley”: The Australian women’s
golf team that went to M.L. to regain
the Tasman Cup staggered that portion
of humanity which heard of the affair by
winning every darned match, singles and
doubles. The win was the more surpris-
ing since the Australian skipper, Mrs
Robinson, was the only Australian to
reach the semi-finals of the M.L. cham-
pionships. Illness prevented some of the
old brigade from going over, and two or
three young and comparatively inexperi-
enced players (in championship golf) got
a show. As usual, the newcomers were
not impressed by reputations, and played
the game of their lives.
* * ❖ sfc
The M.L. women’s golf championship
was won by Betty Gaisford, who beat
her compatriot, Oliver Kay, 4 and 3 in
the final. She was 4 down at the end
of the morning round, but made a won-
derful recovery, winning eight of the
next eleven holes.

“B.” writes that “Caw Cuss” slips
when he says (B. 12/9/’34) that a Can-
berra player lost a stroke when a crow
took his ball up a tree. If the ball had
been moving, says “8.,” quite rightly, he
would have incurred a penalty. As it
was at rest he was free to drop a new
ball without tears (Rule 17-3). Then
“B.” furnishes an addendum which
brings the blush of gratification to the
toiling journalist’s cheek: “I suggest you
make the correction, because so many
readers accept any statement in The
Bui.letin as being accurate.”
* * * *
“Oaklands”: Victoria’s golf heads,
usually averse to charging for admission
to golf links, have suffered a change of
heart. They have announced the pro-
gramme of the British amateurs in Mel-
bourne. This includes half a dozen
matches, and ss. flat will be charged for
the lot. If the gate-money exceeds the
£5OO guarantee given by the V.G.A. the
money will be split among the visiting
American pros, and the Victorian Pro-
fessional G.A.

Don’t lorget that Royal Sydney opens
this year’s Australian championships
at Rose Bay on October 6. The
huge entry is the most comprehensive the
event has known. Players from every
Australian State except Westralia are
competing, as well as two Americans,
Sarazen and Kirkwood. The meeting
runs to October 19, and admission will
be charged, the money
going to swell the
purses for the profes-
sionals.
* * *
“Sandringham”: Vic-
torian golfers were dis-
appointed when W. L.
Hope, the Scottish
holder of the Austra-
lian open golf cham-
pi o nship, announced
that he could not de-
fend his title in Syd-
ney, pressure of busi-
ness being the reason.
He had already with-
drawn from the tour-
ney for the Victorian
titles in the hope that
he might save up enough time to get to
Sydney. Sydney golfers will miss some-
thing, for they have not yet seen the
Scottish amateur, and he is said to be
something out of the bag.
* * * *
“Sandwich”: Unhappy folk like my-
self who have been trying to keep track
of the movements of the overseas golfers
soon to be in Australia are all of a
dither. As far as the writer can under-
stand, one State says that so and so
will happen, and the other says it will
be damned if it will. In Brisbane here
they tell me the American professional
team will be showing in the first week
in November. It seems pretty certain on
present disarrangements that the English
amateurs will be in Brisbane a week
before. Programmes forwarded from
other centres indicate that the tourists
will be like Boyle Roche’s bird —in
several places at once.
* * * *
“Divot Digger”: D. Esplin, champion
of the Australian club, and W. Mac-
kenzie, the club professional, will be the
first Australians to tackle Sarazen and
Kirkwood on these shores, not Fer-
rier and Hattersley, as reported. The
match will be at Kensington on October
9, a day after the Americans reach Syd-
ney ; the Ferrier-Hattersley clash comes
off at Manly next day. The visitors will
play in the Australian open champion-

Extracts from Report by Prominent Mining Engineer with other data on the Files
at the Department of Mines, Perth, W.A.
12/1/T7.
The “Harbour Lights” Mine is situated about one mile fo the North-east of Leonora on
the continuation of the greenstone country in which the Sons of Gwalia lode occurs.
It has been proved at the 60ft. level for a length of 1000 feet, and is connected with the
surface by the No. 1 Central and South shafts.
The central and No. 1 shafts have been sunk to the 90ft. level. The main shaft has been
sunk ,to the 140 ft. level, and is connected to the 60ft. and 90ft. levels by rises, but not by
crosscuts.
Above the 60ft. level the ore has been stoped out for the greater portion of the length
driven (1000 feet), but owing to insufficient mullocking up the stopes were allowed to fall in,
and thousands of tons of payable ore are broken down and buried in the stopes. This broken
ore, and also the ore remaining above this level, was sampled and found to vary from traces
to 40/- per ton. Crushings taken from this ore subsequently gave a return of 17/- over the
plates by amalgamation, and 18/- in the sands and slimes
As the shoots are pitching to the South, only two, “A” and “B,” were worked at the 90ft.
level; “A” Shoot was stoped out, and the stopes fell in at this level. At the 140 ft. level the
cap of a new lens of ore was cut in a crosscut from the Main Shaft, and was proved for a
distance of 90ft., the value of the ore varying from 20/- to 80/- per ton. The apex of this
lens was reached at a height of about 20ft. above the level; 60 tons from this were mined
and crushed for a return of 80/- per ton. It is calculated that this shoot of ore should be
cut in the shaft at a further depth of 50ft., that is, 190 ft. from the surface. By extending the
South drive at the 140 ft. level the “A” Shoot would probably be found, as it was cut in
the rise at a height of 30ft. above this level, showing the Southerly pitch....
The various owners have worked their mine in a hand-to-mouth fashion, and, although
they have mined and crushed approximately 16,000 tons for a return of £39,000, they have
not had their own treatment plant. Most of the ore has been pulled by a whip and carted a
mile to the State Battery, so that the costs of cartage and treatment, and loss of time, have
absorbed fully 30/- per t0n....
Boreholes were put down, the results showing the Southerly pitch of the Shoots. The
Northern bore cut the Eastern lode at 365 ft. in depth, where it assayed 36/- over 36 inches
in width, and the Southern boreholes cut the lode at 280 ft., where it was worth 32/- over
48 inches. The boreholes never reached the Western lode, on which nearly all the work
described above was carried 0ut....
The writer spent some time in sampling and inspecting this Mine, and considers that the
results of the work carried out above water-level are such as to warrant the expenditure of
new capital to test it at the 140 ft. level.
Should this work prove the lode to retain its size and value, there will not be any
difficulty in converting it into a dividend payer, as the cost of mining and treatment under
modern conditions would show a handsome profit on forty-shilling ore over a width of
ten feet, extending one thousand feet in length, as proved at the 60ft. level.
Extracts from Report by Mr. H. Annear 7/9/1934.
The area under consideration consists of 72 acres....
The position is admirably situated, being as it is within one mile of a railway and township.
This must be regarded as an important factor regarding the future working of the Mine and
transportation of all materials, plant, etc.
The distance is approximately 160 miles from Kalgoorlie. %
The main Leonora to Wiluna Road passes within a few hundred yards of the afore-
mentioned Mine.
The “LEONORA CENTRAL” Mine is on the continuation of the greenstone country,
in which occurs the well-known “Sons of Gwalia” Lode.
There are two lodes, namely, the Eastern and the Western.
Previous to the year - 1917 the mine was worked by parties of miners. The Western lode
has been stoped from a depth of 60 feet, over a length of 1000 feet. Some further work
was carried out at the 90-feet lovel, also at the 140-feet level, but it is stated that the miners
worked under great difficulties on account of the flow of water and the inadequate plant which
was used. Also it is stated that the returns from sands were not available to the working
parties, which would naturally be a serious obstacle. Later, when all of the ore was mined
in the upper portion of the workings, it appears that the parties were not sufficiently well
organised to carry out the more difficult work of mining with a regular flow of water to
contend with, consequently the Leonora Central lode awaits exploitation under the most
favorable conditions which now exist....
BOREHOLES. —Two deep bores are recorded. The Northern bore cut the Eastern lode
at 365 feet, when it assayed 36/- per ten in value over a width of 36 inches. The Southern
bore cut the lode at 280 feet, when it was worth 32/- per ton over 48 inches in width.
It is stated that neither of the boreholes reached the Western lode, on which nearly all
of the ore was won.
With these favorable results at the mentioned depths, the future development work which
will be~carried out can be looked forward to with reasonable expectations that the “Leonora
Central” Mine will be an early producer and should join the list of dividend-producers.
CONCLUSION.—In view of the fact that the total value of the ore mined averaged 39/-
per ton (old price), and that values are recorded by boreholes to depths of 290 feet and
365 feet respectively, the proposition does appeal greatly, and I have every confidence in
recommending the further development of these lodes. The nature of the lode material lends
itself to the mo 9 simple treatment, and it is easily worked, allowing for very low values to be
handled at a profit. (Signed) H. ANNEAR.

“Marino”: Australian professional
golfers have been competing for the dis-
tinction of representing their States in
the big centenary fixtures. Fergus Mc-
Mahon won the right to play for South
Australia, but not until after a play-off
with Harvey.
* * * *
“Hamilton”: Touching that Canberra
crow that cleared out with a player’s
ball but laid him under no penalty, as
the ball was at rest (B. 12/9/’34), a
Brisbane professional had a similar but
more agonising experience. A long shot
was running up to the green when a
stray cattle-dog spotted and seized it, and
“awa tae th’ Hill.” As the ball was in
motion the original owner had to play
another.
Racquet and Bawl
“Rev. Knucklebone”: The returned
Australian Davis Cup team has achieved
one triumph—it brought back more
money than any of its predecessors. The
profit will be about £l5OO, and this goes
into a special Davis Cup fund. Crawford
got off the boat at Fremantle and
travelled overland to Adelaide.- His
asthma has been troubling him again.
* * * *
“Top Spin”: Fred Perry continues to
add to his string of scalps. Following
on his win in the All-America singles,
he took the Pacific south-western cham-
pionship at Los Angeles by beating
Stoeffen 10-8, 6-4, 6-3. All the Yankee
champions, including Allison and Van
Ryn, were playing, so the performance
was practically a repetition of his tri-
umphs in the east.
* * * *
“S.G.S.”: Ray Dunlop, one of the
soundest of Sydney’s tennis players, but
unlucky as a title-collector, took the
City of Sydney championship last week,
this being his third consecutive try. With
the Davis Cup men away the opposition
might have been stronger, but some of
the young entry, notably Bromwich,
made a fine showing.

“Jeremiah”: Bill Tilden has taken on
the role of a prophet of late, and so
far has proved better at playing tennis.
Last week he announced that Perry's
tennis was definitely going off, and added
that he would put Von Cramm before
him on the world’s ranking list. Perry
promptly replied by cleaning up the best
of American and other talent at the Los
Angeles championships, and William is
still thinking out the answer.
* * * *
“Kooyong”: The Australian L.T.A.
has recommended that the State asso-
ciations adopt the new footfault rule
proposed by the International Federa-
tion. When the fool thing was suggested
last summer, The Bulletin pointed out
that the same trouble would begin all
over again. The new rule ordains a line
two feet behind the court baseline. The
server stands behind this, and if he puts
a foot or portion thereof over he is
footfaulted. As this happens when he
puts his hoof over the baseline proper
under the old rule, it is difficult to see
any reason for giving him a new line to
hop about on, as he incurs just the same
penalty as he did under the old rule.
$ * * *
“Katana”: Someone pointed out in
The Bulletin recently that, while Mel-
bourne was intercepting all athletes com-
ing from abroad to the centenary games
by the southern route and interning
them before N.S.W. could get hold of
them, there was a spot of sunshine for
Ma. A team of Japanese tennis players
was scheduled to come down the east
-coast. The Japs, have now cancelled
their trip. Poor old Ma!
* ❖ * *
“Fitzcray”: Delegates to the Aus-
tralian L.T.A. are already squabbling
over the division of the centenary tour-
ney spoils. The head body asked the
States in which international matches
were to be played for 55 per cent, of the
gross receipts, less tax. Ma’s delegates
have kicked, of course, and -want an
equal division of the plunder among all
parties concerned. The matter has been
sent back to the finance committee to
chew over.
Miscellaneous
“Spinnaker”: The America's Cup has
been retained by the Yanks, Rainbow
winning four heats off the reel after
Endeavour had taken the first two.
American opinion is that the English boat
is much the faster in any wind, but that
her amateur skipper and crew, on tricky
water entirely strange to them, could
not cope with Vanderbilt’s professionals,
who have spent most of their lives sail-
ing in L.I. Sound. The affair ended un-
pleasantly. In the third race Sopwith
claimed he had been fouled twice. Going
on the cabled reports there is little doubt
that he was. Instead of hoisting the pro-
test flag at once, however, he delayed to
the finishing line. The American com-
mittee says the flag should have gone up
at once. It made this an excuse for
dodging the issue of the fouls, and
Americans were the first to condemn it.
But, instead of keeping his temper, Sop-
with blustered, and thus made a mess of
the good case he had. In the last race
both sides protested, but as Sopwith lost
by 55sec. he threw in the towel. This
may be the last challenge. As a
London newspaper says, the public has
had enough of bodyline bowling and
wants no bodyline yachting.

“Bumpk”: Those who go down to
the sea in yachts have not been neglected
by Melbourne Centenary Council. There
will be £1750 to be won in prizes be-
tween December 26 and January 5, and
the period selected is a merry time on
Port Phillip for anything in the way of
weather except snow. Events will be
divided among all classes, ocean-goers
to dinghies. The star items will be the
international six-metre race for a cham-
pionship cup and £lOO ; the six-metre
invitation race for £100; the inter-
national star class for a gold cup and the
Northcote Cup, also for six-metre vessels, j
Two American contestants are expected, |
and several English.

“Hotham”: Melbourne oarsmen got
their first glimpse of the Fairbairn style
of rowing as expounded by experts when
the London Club took the water on the
Yarra last week. The style dumbfounded
the old school accustomed to the straight
back and the stiff arm in the forward
swing and recovery. The new lot sit
crouched up in the boat like a lot of
asthmatic old gentlemen in bathchairs.
The forward reach is not a long one, and
is made with slightly-bent arms. These
are used extensively in the back swing,
with a leg drive which for swiftness and
intensity was an eye-opener to the Cab-
bage Gardeners.
* * * *
“Huon”: If anyone wants a fight,
Tasmanian rowing men have one to sell
cheap. The annual report of the T.R.A.
goes baldheaded for the mainland press,
which, after the last fiasco in the King’s
Cup on the Derwent, pronounced the
course unfit for an event of this kind.
“Untruthful, misleading, scurrilous and
unsporting” is only one of many choice 1
bits. Bitter reference is made to visitors
who quaffed the cup of Tassie hospitality
to the dregs and then went home to
criticise. All the same, the facts are
hard to get over.
* * * *
“Mere Male”: Those parts of Europe
not affected have been moved to un-
seemly mirth by the allegation of some
South African officials that some of the
women athletes at the international meet-
ing in London lately were a lot more
like men than women. One asserted
that several were men. A shriek went up
from the insulted females —or, rather, a
bellow, for it is alleged that they all have
bass voices and shave twice a day—and
international relations, which sports are
supposed to strengthen, are up to putty.
Somehow it recalls Mark Twain’s sum-
ming up of the Parisian grisettes, of
whom he had read in Murger or Paul
de Kock. Mark chronicled that they all
had ghastly figures, sallow complexions,
bass voices and moustaches and dressed
abominably. “To call them immoral,”
he summed up, “would be base flattery.’
* 'i' ■!>
“Outside Right”: The Australian
hockey team did finely in M.L., though it
failed to lift the Manning Cup in the
Test. Of 18 matches played, 12 were
won, five lost and one drawn ; 68 goals
were scored to 28. The heavy grounds
handicapped players somewhat. Allen,
of South Australia, was the star player, '
and another attraction was Le Lievre, of
N.S.W. He is a fine amateur wrestler,
and was rushed for exhibitions by the
Maorilanders, who are cranky on the
mat game. M.L. hospitality proved hard
to overcome. Writer doesn’t doubt it,
having drunk a dozen or so pints at
Speight’s brewery one morning, with the
result that he was quite unable to do
himself justice playing football against
Otago that afternoon.

“Splash”: N. S. Wales wants a team of
Japanese swimmers to show in Sydney
next year. Ma has brought over some
fine Japanese swimming combinations,
but devil a return visit has been paid,
though invitations by the dozen have
been issued. Ma is not alone to blame,
the worst sinners in this respect being the
Australian L.T.A. ; and other sporting
bodies have offended. About the only
crowd that has honored its obligations
is the Rugby Union, which last year
returned the call paid by a Japanese
team to Sydney some years ago.

Picking ’Em
Despite some disappointments, mining
shares are still the chief gamble on Aus-
tralian Stock Exchanges. Westralia pro-
duced 1,337,251 sovereigns’-worth of
gold during the first half of this year,
valued at £2,641,569 in Australian cur-
rency.
The Australian market’s appraisement
of four of Westralia’s largest dividend-
paying mines—Lake View and Star,
Wiluna, North Kalgurli and Sons of
Gwalia —was recently £14,000,000. Cer-
tainly they represent the highlights of the
Westralian gold investment market; but
after them come Boulder Perseverance
and Great Boulder, Star Exploration,
Norseman, Golden Horseshoe, Associated
(New) and other producers, besides
Anglo-Australian, Assoc. Mining and
Finance, Lancefield, Rothsay, Ladies
Gladys, Evelyn, Shenton and Miller, and
dozens of less aristocratic shows not yet
on the div. list. In nearly every case the
scrip is at a premium, usually high.
The price of gold seems set fair for a
good while yet. The public insists on
dabbling. Therefore, let it dabble with
discretion—the Lord knows it has plenty
of opportunity for variety, even among
the Ladies.
Irrespective of what the market may
think of a mine, it is a good idea to
examine the evidence as to whether there
is gold in it; and even that is not enough.
If it’s going to cost more to separate the
gold from the dirt than the gold is
worth, the show’s no good.
How far from civilisation the mine-to-
be is situated is the next question. If
it’s one of those propositions in the
snow country of N. S. Wales or Vic.,
where it can’t be worked in the winter
owing to the frozen nature of the ground,
or in the spring and summer owing to
the floods caused by the melting snow,
it’s a good idea to find out what can be
done in the autumn. Similar caution
should be exercised with tropical mines,
which may be too wet to work in the wet
season and too dry to operate in the dry
season. To and from such shows
directors travel in aeroplanes and other
expensive gadgets.
If possible, get hold of a prospectus.
Find out who the directors are, and what
they are. Also what the vendors, pro-
moters, option-holders and lessees take
out of the float in shares and cash. Then,
from the data available, try to ascertain
whether the gold estimated to exist in
the show, if and when separated from the
dirt, will yield enough profit to pay divi-
dends and return the capital which you
have subscribed in cash, and that which
the promoters haven’t.
If all these tests are applied, and the
concern has the earmarks of being a
moneymaker, it will probably be found
that there is no opportunity of getting
into it on the ground floor. The price on
the Stock Exchange will very likely be
two or three times par value. The prob-
lem then is: Is the mine likely to return
two or three times its paid capital from
profits, and show, say, a 10 p.c. return as
well? The four big Westralian mines
previously mentioned may be quite cap-
able of recovering £14,000,000-worth
more gold than is spent in extracting it,
and showing a satisfactory return to the
investor besides ; but how many others
are likely to show profits in proportion?
Design for a Companies Act
The time is now ripe for revision of
company laws throughout the Common-
wealth. Australia is astounded at ad-
missions made at the “Trust” inquiry
now in progress at Sydney ; but it is not
the first time—nor will it be the last,
unless prompt action is taken —that the
amazing weaknesses of company statutes,
particularly those of N. S. Wales, have
been shown up.
The smaller investor is at a definite
disadvantage when dealing with com-
pany promoters, however well-inten-
tioned. Legislation covering the following
points would ensure much greater pro-
tection :
As regards the prospectus :
(a ) It should be dated, and the directors
held responsible for its accuracy.
(b) No public ’ issue of shares to be made
without registration of prospectus; audited
balance sheet of any business to be acquired
to be included.
(c) The prospectus should disclose considera-
tion to vendors and promoters; nature ot
assets (tangibles to be separated from intan-
gibles) being acquired; contracts of employ-
ment entered into, including term and salary;
number of shares taken for cash by each
director; minimum subscription for allotment;
if land, mines or other assets to be bought
from vendors, nature of dealings and con-
sideration during previous 12 months.
( d ) if any director or promoter has been
found guilty of misconduct under Act, the fact
to be stated in prospectus.
( e ) if any director has been director
or manager of any co. liquidated compul-
sorily or under supervision of Court, names ol
such cos. to be disclosed.
(/) A sworn statement of out-of-pocket exes,
intended to be recovered by promoters.
(g) Not more than 10 p.c. commission to
be allowed on sale of shares or bonds; and
all bond or similar contracts to be contracts
überrima; fidei.
Generally :
(a) Every shareholder, pref. or ord., to be
entitled to copy of p. and I. account and
balance sheet each year; annual meetings to
be held within intervals of not more than 15
months.
( b ) A copy of every co.’s balance sheet to
be filed with registrar, such b.s. to be audited.
(c) An actuarial valuation of life cos. to be
made every three years and a copy filed.
(cl) If any director, personally or as share-
holder in another co., benefits through sale ol
capital assets or securities, such transaction to
be disclosed at general meeting.
(e) Appointment of directors of “proprietary”
life offices to require sanction by policy-holders.
(/) Bondholders to be allowed 50 p.c. repre-
sentation on board of lf bond” cos., such pro-
"It must ’a been a Communist, mister!"
vision to be made intra vires Companies and
Partnership Acts.
(?) Special resolutions to be decided by poll,
with independent scrutineers.
(h) Ascertained debts to be shown separately
from unascertained and contingent liabilities
in balance sheet, and floating assets to be dis-
tinguished from fixed and intangible. Shares
issued for consideration other than cash to be
shown separately.
(0 Individual or aggregate accounts of sub-
sidiary cos. to be exhibited by. holding cos.
(/) A special section of Act to cover all
investment contracts other than shares, mort-
gage debentures, public securities and life poli-
cies, and profits on land and service sales
by bond cos. to be limited to a specified per-
centage.
It requires a referendum for the Com-
monwealth to legislate on company mat-
ters. Until such public permission is
given, the best that can be hoped for is
uniform and adequate State Acts.
For Members Only?
N. S. Wales Government is consider-
ing anti-share-hawking legislation ; every-
one is offering suggestions, one of which
is that the placing of shares should be
restricted to Stock Exchange channels.
This unimaginative remedy, if adopted,
might eventually become more of an in-
cubus than the disease is a curse.
Stock Exchange members generally are
very estimable gentlemen. Their main
source of revenue is commission on sales
of shares —to date mainly in established
companies. Particularly these days of
hectic mining turnovers they have very
little time to devote to much other than
buying and selling on ’Change.
If the flotation of all new enterprises
is made a close preserve of the Stock
Exchanges it will show a lack of
energy and foresight. The main trouble
with go-getting concerns lies not
amongst salesmen on the road (how-
ever unscrupulous some of them may
be), but with the companies that em-
ploy them. Tight legislation, on the
lines suggested elsewhere on this page,
and the restriction of selling exes, to,
say, 10 p.c. would do a great deal to
curb this evil. It is the laxity of present
laws, which allow mushroom cos. to
flourish as they do, that is the main
trouble.
If all salesmen, life assurance or other-
wise, were compelled to be registered,
and the co. which employs them held
responsible—a security of £lOO for each
canvasser might be required to be de-
posited with recognised trustee cos. —
most of the present evils would be wiped
out. There is no good reason for mak-
ing company flotation a vested interest
for any one section.
According to C. W. Wilson, chairman
of the Taxpayers’ Association of Vic., in
1931 18,000 estates dealt with yielded
Federal and State death duties of
£5,615,783, which had to be paid in cash.
Forced sales of property were the rule
in order to meet these duties. The
taxes, from capital savings, were brought
into the Treasuries as current revenue ;
“prudent public finance would suggest
that death duties be used to reduce the
public debt.”
* * * *
The annual report of the Vic. Tax-
payers’ Association quoted the Prime
Minister as having said that the Federal
property tax was a “savage, silly, stupid
super-tax,” while in response to a depu-
tation he said that “if we could lift the
Federal land tax and still balance our
Budget we would do it.” The Budget
had been balanced, but the tax remained.
In the association’s opinion, the land tax
was “conceived in malice and is adminis-
tered by guesswork.” Federal land tax
operates like the ill-considered bludgeon
that it is; it frequently takes an accoun-
tant days to check a company’s assess-
ment.
* * * *
Sir John Cadman, a director of Anglo-
Persian Oil, on a visit to Australia, says
he has taken an interest in the extraction
of oil from coal, but so far coal-oil can-
not economically compare with gusher
oil. That has never been doubted ; the
point, as far as Australia is concerned,
is whether coal-oil becomes economic
when the 7d. a gallon excise has been
added to the cost of imported petrol.
Even then it would probably require
a very large hydrogenation plant for
the product to be at all competi-
tive. The investigation committee is
recommending Federal Government to
defer consideration of erecting a distilla-
tion plant for 12 months. “The erection
of a plant in Australia at present might
be attended by huge financial loss,” is
its opinion.
* * * *
England has set Archdale Parkhill a
good example by reducing to Is.
the fee for telephone trunk calls
(three minutes) between 7 p.m. and
9 a.m. The longest distance over which
a call can be made is about 600 miles.
In Australia the inter-capital minimum
charge is 2s. 6d., and Australians need
cheap long-distance facilities far more
than people in closely-settled England.

“E.V.”: Melbourne outburst of Her-
bert Gepp, chairman of the interminable
Royal Commission on wheat and bread:
I am unable to understand any feeling
on the part of the community at an in-
crease in the price of bread. Considering
the importance of the wheat industry....
it seems regrettable that a rise of Id. a
day in household expenditure should cause
resentment.
If Mr. Gepp got £5 a month instead of
£lO a day or thereabouts, he might think
differently.
* * * *
“Ardup”: Banks have been reducing
interest in harmony with the general
trend, but one of the larger Aus-
tralian mutual life offices is add-
ing 1 per cent, to the interest on
loans on policies. Further, if a policy-
holder who already has a loan asks for
an increase he is made to pay the addi-
tional 1 per cent, on the old loan. It is
usually the small policy-holder who is
hard up enough to hypothecate his rainy-
day investment. It is cheering to know
that the A.M.P. has consistently lowered
the rate.
* * * St
N.S.W. Government is at last introduc-
ing legislation to alleviate the burden of
double taxation on inter-State income.
A reciprocal arrangement has been
made with Victoria. The declared inten-
tion is to make income taxable only in
the State in which it is earned.
St St St St
Last week the branch offices of Inter-
national Combustion, Ltd., at Sydney,
Johannesburg, Bombay, Calcutta, Cape-
town, New York, Paris, Melbourne,
Adelaide and Perth had a chat with
London head office and a confab
amongst themselves
over the wireless tele-
phone circuit. It is
claimed to be the first
instance in which inter-
national branch offices
have been brought to-
gether simultaneously
in this way. The cost
of the entertainment
was forgotten when
head office reported
that over £1,000,000
worth of orders had
been received during
June and July.

“Si Anu”: The kam-
pong Malay will shortly
be swept into the main
current of progress.
The F.M.S. Agricultural Depart-
ment, alarmed at the steady im-
poverishment of the ryot, has de-
cided to place receiving sets in the
villages so that it can broadcast
propaganda for bigger and better
farming. As the Malay never was
interested in anything bigger and
better than what satisfied his an-
cestors he is to be lured to the
loudspeaker by bright music and
native-patter artists —there are no
better comedians than the Malay
Wheelers and Woolseys.

“Bill Ding”: Proved to have the finest
house-building woods in the world—
there are still extant cottages built by the
pioneers 100 years ago—Australia didn’t
put up one of the Empire cottages at
the recent R.A.S. at Ipswich (Eng.). A
concession was made to Queensland to
provide some maple and walnut doors ;
but British-Columbian fir weatherboards
and frames and hemlock floors formed
the bulk of the materials. The object was
to show the brick-and-stone-loving Eng-
lishman that he could get a perfect sub-
stitute for a good deal less money.

“John Dee”: There’s still a little
money in horses, it seems. Caught in a
weak moment, I bought from a dead-
beat a packet' labelled “lavender,” and
described as “a delicate and lasting per-
fume. Instead of being dried flowers,
the filling was evidently portion of his
previous night’s bunk —assuming that he
slept in an unoccupied stable.

NORTH OF

Exit Bob Shadforth
“Gregory”: Bob Shadforth, of Burke-
town, just on 80, is dead. He was the
eldest son of F. H. Shadforth, who, with
his wife and family, left Victoria in the
’seventies and travelled overland to the
Gulf. He stayed awhile, and built a
homestead on what is now Austral
Downs (N.T.); but, owing to doubt
about the border-line between Q’land
and the Territory, he surrendered the
property and took up Lilydale (now
Riversleigh) on the Gregory River.
Bob, the eldest of a family of 11,
worked in the Gulf country all his life.
He helped on the home station, took up
property of his own, married twice (each
of his wives brought him children), was
speared by blacks, acted as shire clerk
and commission agent, and remained the
same modest, carefree, happy and quiet
person he always was. A broken nose
and old spear wounds affected him not
at all, and up to within a few years of
his death he was as keen on sport as any
boy—and few, if any, knew the ways
of the ’gator as well as old Bob did.
The story of his main spear wound
as he told it to me: He was managing-
owner of Wollogorang, a wild and lonely
spot. A gang led by a notorious buck
was after Bob. It attacked the home-
stead at night. The verandah was en-
closed with diamond-paned netting,
which Bob averred, from long experi-
ence, was the best protection possible
from the thrown spear. A spear glanced
and hit Bob on the back. He fired both
barrels and turned to go through the
door. He couldn’t! The spear had
passed through his back, and projected
on either side. They pulled the spear
right through—the barb wouldn’t allow
it to be pulled back—beat off the blacks
and carried on.
The Shadforth family bred one well-
known Bulletin contributor. Bob’s
sister married Sub-inspector Lamond, of
the mounted police, and her son, H. G.
Lamond, the naturalist, was the first
white child born on the Riversleigh
country half a century ago.
“Elsee”: Angaston (S.A.) now houses
most of the heroes of “We of the Never-
Never.” Jack McLeod, the Quiet
Stockman, one of the best horsemen in
the North 30 years ago, lives there with
Herbert Bryant, better known as the
Dandy; and Dick McLennan, brother
of the Sanguine Scot, has been on a visit.
Many an old Territorian goes down to
yarn with them. Mrs. Gunn, of course,
lives in Melbourne.

“S.T.”: Civilisation is invading the
North with a vengeance, and soon —in a
few generations at the present rate —an
old familiar scent of the early tropic
morning will be a thing of the past.
Fifteen years ago Brisbane could boast
that it was the only unsewered white
city of its size in the world, but with
great toil and trouble it is remedying
that; and now Townsville has decided
to go sanitary. A £500,000 scheme has
been adopted, half to be raised by loan
and half by Government subsidy. As
there is an election next year, the subsidy
will probably be all right.

“Kaloa”: The aeroplane has saved
four lives in the Northern Territory in
three months. The last case was that of a
peanut-farmer whose condition called for
a theatre operation at short notice. C. C.
Fenton, the local flying doctor, took
off with him in the moonlight from the
Katherine for Darwin. Anybody who
knows the country and the landmarks
will realise the risks, which were almost
as great as that of landing after the
three-hour run. Mechanics at the land-
ing ground climbed the “sausage pole”
to give the wind direction with torches.
At half an hour after midnight the
patient was rushed to hospital, and just
as dawn was breaking the doctor washed
his hands and took off again to breakfast
200 miles away in Katherine. It’s about
time they had a decent hospital at
Eumungalan or Marranboy.
* * * *
“Vic”: North Australia might take a
look at the road-making methods of
Robert Bratten, to whom a memorial
tablet was unveiled .in Tumby Bay
(S.A.) on October 2. He developed his
technique only in 1929, but already the
verb “to brattenise” is familiar through-
out his native State. Formerly, it cost
the S.A. Highways Commission up to
£8 a chain to deal with roads over stony
outcrops and to repair tracks which,
already made, had been worn down to
the limestone. By the use of a tractor
and a heavy beam plough and grader,
Mr. Bratten, who was overseer to the
Tumby Bay Council on the western side
of Spencer’s Gulf (S.A.), cut down the
cost of treatment, according to Mr. D.
V. Fleming, Highways Commissioner, to
an average of £2 13s. per chain —in some
cases to as low as £1 per chain.

“Dajarra”: I am sorry I shan’t be in
Cloncurry next month. 1 was there
when the first motor-car came through,
and I travelled on the first ballast train
that puffed in. It seems a pity to break
a record and not answer the invitation:
“Come to the Diggers’ show (October
19 and 20) and see the horseraces and
the first centenary air race.” However,
I hope a lot of the chaps will act as my
proxies.
* ❖ *
“Isnik Geul”: Yes, 1 know all about
Hunter’s and Barallier’s reports on the
word “coo-ee” (“Hallo,” B. 26/9/’34).
It was clever of Hunter to discover
that the word means “come here,” because
there is nothing in the reliable vocabu-
laries to suggest it. The fact remains
that, if it was in use, it was close to a
settlement full of people with Indian
experience and familiar with the Hindu
“Stingy cow! Wish ’e was pushin' up daisies! "
“Daisies? ’E’d shove up stinkwort.”
cry “Kooee-hai,” whereas in North Aus-
tralia (say around the McArthur and the
Roper) the native cry is a “lu-luing” like
that of the Roman soldiery. If “coo-ee”
has a local native derivation the Kalka-
doon “kouara” (the cry of the dingo)
seems to offer the natural origin—the
dingo call is far-reaching and easily imi-
tated ; but, of course, it may be an im-
memorial word brought from Asia, like
the mid-western Queensland terms for
“water,” “yellow,” “fashioned” and
“rough,” which have their cognates in
Tamil, Hindi and Turkish. Australian lan-
guages have strange survivals which sug-
gest more catholic contacts with the out-
side world than most ethnologists have
yet dreamed of. I know two adjacent
tribes in N.-W. Queensland. With one
the word for woman is cognate with the
Cantonese ; in the next with the Scan-
dinavian languages.
* * * *
“Marburg”: So Brisbane’s new Turn
Verein is open—“the German community
has made its contribution towards solving
the unemployment problem in building
it.” The old building, which used to
house the club at the ’Gabba before the
war, couldn’t have employed many build-
ers. It was galvanised iron, and hot, but
the beer was good and the music better.
The last time I was there was in July,
’l4, when Dr. Hirschfeld, the Consul who
died broken-hearted afterwards in Ger-
many, linked the King and the Kaiser in
a toast. A month afterwards anyone
who had done that would have been torn
in strips. But so quickly do friends change
to enemies and vice versa that Diggers
of German origin mingled last week at
the opening with ex-internees and ene-
mies, and somebody proposed “The Gov-
ernment.” Three foundation members
with 51 years’ standing attended —H.
Weigal, K. Raber and H. Kliiver.
* * * *
Walter Lucas: “W.L.K.” (B. 12/9/’34)
himself indulges in “loose talk” re S.S.
islanders. “Kanaka” is a Polynesian
(Central Pacific) term of contempt for
lower-class natives. Notwithstanding
loosely-worded Queensland Acts govern-
ing thq introduction and employment of
S.S. islanders, they were all Melanesians
from the W. Pacific. I repatriated 7000
of them for the Commonwealth, and
there was not a “Kanaka” among the
lot. In New Britain and New Guinea, the
small settlement of Polynesian blood dis-
paragingly dubbed the locals “Kanakas.”
The imported word has there come to
mean an ignorant native. In trustworthi-
ness they differ in no way from other
humans. There are heroes, cowards,
toilers and loafers, clever and stupid.
Their response to leadership is exactly
the same as that of Australian troops.
Under a capable and sympathetic com-
mand they are usually loyal and willing ;
but if a bully, a fool or a coward bosses
them, trouble may be expected.
* >.< *
“Red Hill”: How some of the old
hands of 50 years ago would roar at the
features of the new Brisbane press! Since
polite Melbourne influence made itself
felt in the northern capital, straw ballots
to decide whether radio listeners prefer
crooners to classical music and “Are
You Like Mother?” competitions have
replaced some of the news; but the cul-
mination has been surely reached when
the greatest daily of a rugged pioneering
State gives up nearly a column of its
leader page to “Correct Wear for Men,”
illustrated with a tailor’s plate—“the
latest fashion in formal evening wear;
note the higher waist and the pleats in
the trousers.” It is not now etiquette,
according to the paper’s authority, to
carry an umbrella when in any kind of
sporting rig, and,
As the Duke of Gloucester has expressed
a wish that lounge suits be worn on most
informal occasions, it is safe to predict
that few Queenslanders will do otherwise.
There was an ancient occasion in Queens-
land when a dress coat became called
for at a Government House levee, and
every scion of Eton and Harrow present
achieved the ideal with a community gar-
ment which was removed outside after
each man made his bow and lent to
the next comer. Papers were delicately
silent on sartorial matters in those hardy
times.
* * * *
“V.E.”: I back “Tripod” in his ex-
changes with “Beachcomber” about
northern current's (B. 22/8/’34 and
19/9/’34). As a Moreton Bay addict,
I know that when the John Oxley
searches for drifting buoys she looks
south; that the Bribie current (as we
call it) cuts a gutter 30ft. out from the
Bribie beach ; that Bribie beach is one
of the world’s cleanest; that the balls
which “Beachcomber” found come from
trawl nets, not from the Coogee shark
boudoir. I have potted cocoanuts in
that current off the Bribie coast.
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
Dr. Arthur Murphy and his attractive wife
took time off from their packing to throw a
cheery Italian dinner at the Belle Vue for Connie
Cervetto and Gian Luciano, whose marriage is
booked for the near future. All the guests
except Justice and Mrs. Webb were sons and
daughters of Italy.
At the last evening Arranged by the Authors
and Artists’ Society, of which Stanhope Hobday
is president, Alice Bott explained the whole
process of pottery, from building and baking
to glazing. Veteran artist Ashton Murphy also
said a few words.
Many of the stallholders at next April’s
Government House fete for Girl Guides and
Boy Scouts are starting to gather in the baw-
bees, the latest affair being a dance and bridge
party at the Belle Vue to help along the funds
of the trousseau stall. Mrs. J. D. Bell and
Mrs. Arnold Conrad were the hostesses, with
Molly Story as hon. sec. The Macartney lady,
the Girl Guides* State Commissioner, came
along, as did most of the members of the com-
mittee.
Our younger set is devoting itself very much
to good works. Yvonne Lochncr, Heather Ash-
win and Myra Darnley staged a dance at Mrs.
J. P. Petersen’s home in aid of the funds of
the Metropolitan branch of the C.W.A. About
100 guests enjoyed their supper at tables beauti-
fied with gerberas and Iceland poppies by Edna
Hogg.
Two Brisbane girls whose present homes are
in Fiji are here- —Mrs. Vaughan Cole and Mrs.
Clem Harlen. There have been several parties
for them, and Mrs. J. A. Jewell got out the
green tables t’other afternoon for bridge in their
honor. Mrs. Cole is staying with dad, Mr.
Lewis, at Kangaroo Point, and Mrs. Harlen is
with her mother, Mrs. Besley, at Annerley.
We hear that impending royalty is an ardent
dancer. In fact, he won first prize one night
at Florence’s, in Montmartre. Carpentier led
the event —a “black shuffle” —and Pnnce Henry
grabbed the large brown hand of Florence
Walton, the proprietress, and joined in. He
and his partner won.
The newest engagement: Hugh Moore, only
son of the Isaac Moores, of Hamilton and
Barambah, to Babe Cobcroft, youngest daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. C. V. Cobcroft, of Double
Bay, Sydney. Hugh is a
nice-looking boy, and the
little bride-to-be has a smile
that wins her friends
wherever she goes. She
spent Show Week in Bris-
bane with Hugh’s mother,
and the wiseacres said then
that there was something
in the wind. Mrs. Moore
was one of the handsome
Hall girls, and Mrs. D’Arcy
Winten is her sister.
Captain Tom Warren
White has been transferred
from Lismore back to Bris-
bane. Mrs. White was a
Brisbane girl—a Miss
Couldery—and she and her
husband have been staying
with her parents at New
Farm.
Diana Mills, daughter of
Mrs. Harry Mills, who now
lives in London, has been
acclaimed one of the most
beautiful girls in London
by newspapers which re-
ported the wedding of Lady
Marguerite Bligh, the Earl
of Darnley’s daughter, to
Claude Strickland. Diana
was bridesmaid, in aqua-
marine blue, which
matched her eyes.
The Floral Festival for the Creche and
Kindergarten lived up to its name, for a more
brilliant mass of flowers surely seldom has been
seen than that which filled the City Hall.
Wistaria, which is at the height of its beauty
just now, draped some of the stalls; peach-
blossoms were everywhere, as were the long
orange trails of the bignonia venusta and the
paler yellow of its relation, tweediana. Kitty Hill-
coat, the pretty secretary, scored a popular win
for her decorated table. She used nasturtiums
and tall orange candles. Brisbane’s prettiest
girls thrust happy faces through the floral
screens and were judged by several males,
headed by Donald Cameron, M.P. The show
ran for two days.
At the moment of writing, the A.N.A.’s fif-
teenth eisteddfod is in full swing. Devoted
parents and keen-eyed teachers think nothing
of sitting for three hours while 17 little,girls re-
cite “I Love Little Fluffy,” or something equally
futile; or while thirty children of assorted sexes
bang out the same tuneless “piece” on a piano;
but to those who cannot qualify either as
parents or teachers the entertainment is the
highest form of torture. Apparently, though,
it fills a long-felt want or something, for there
are record entries —2000 of them.
To raise £642 at the cost of £lO is an achieve-
ment ; and the people who did it were
Mesdames M. S. Herring and M. Christopher-
sen, who launched a Penny Appeal for the
Creche and Kindergarten and Nursery School
Stretcher Fund. Of seven who helped, Mr. M.
Christophersen raised £l3O-odd. About £lOO
will be spent on stretchers, which will be distri-
buted three dozen to each of six kindergartens.
The rest of the money will be put into the
general maintenance.
The United Service Club insists on having a
ball for the Duke of Gloucester, though
whether he will enjoy dancing in Brisbane in
December is a moot point. To make matters
worse, it is on the same evening—December 6
as the United Charities Ball, to which the royal
visitor also will be led. The military affair is
at the Trocadero. But the United Service Club
will also entertain him on the previous after-
noon. A cocktail party or something.
Mrs. Jack Foxton, who was one of the
Hunter-Brown girls, came from Mitchell, en
route to Sydney, for the wedding of her sister
Alberta to Paul Foxton. After the wedding,
which is fixed for to-day, she will return home,
with Betty Fletcher, just back from an Island
cruise, as her guest.
Dr. J. L. Cuppaidge is dead. His wife was
a Miss Russell, daughter of Major William
Russell, of County Cork. Two daughters,
Mrs. P. L. Mill and Mrs. L. F. Tribe, live in
the Federated Malay States; Mrs. J. S. Mehan,
of Brisbane, is another daughter, and the
sons, L. R. and E. R. Cuppaidge, hang up
their respective hats in Blackall and Brisbane.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
At Randwick on Saturday the weather
found favor with everyone save wearers
of the beret. The large- and extra-large-
hatted gloried in the sunshine and the
protection the brims afforded to make-
up. Toe-length frocks were in the
minority. M .L. flying-girl Jean Batten wore
one in floral georgette. She came with
knight Frederick McMaster and daughter
Thelma. Australian-skyline blue and the
blue of delphinium that bordered the
lawns were repeated again and again,
sometimes alone, sometimes in combina-
tion, in frocks and accessories. Field-
flower-spattered and figured silks were
seen at every turn. White and blue shoes
were worn by many, and red flashed by
occasionally.
Kelso King and his lady, Mrs. Colin
Venn, Mrs. Walter Brunton and the
Reggie Allens were among those who
lunched with the G.-G. and" Lady Isaacs,
whose nut-brown crepes were garnished
with gold embroideries and long sash
ends. The Acting-Gov. and his wife ate
with the committee, and at the board ex-
changed tips with the knightly Thomas
Bavins and Mrs.Burgess-Watson. This lady
wore one of the few taffeta coats abroad
in the land. It was three-quarter length,
and, as befitting the wife of a rear-
admiral, navy in hue. The men were
the high hatters in these two groups, the
women all sticking to the flat crown of
the moment.
Surgeon McKelvey’s lady was striking
in her matchbox plaid, all yellows, whites
and blacks, and black was the ribbon
that banded her gold-yellow wide-
brimmed hat. Mrs. Harry Budge picked
her winners in brown-and-white-patterned
crepes and a large brown hat. Sadie
smiled over her losses in blues. Rear-
Admiral Feakes’s wife wore black and
white with distinction.
King’s Counsel Flannery’s wife wore
unadorned navy crepes. Mrs. Her-
bert Moran topped hers with a
Tuscan hat, and Mrs. Walter Burfitt
brightened hers with palely-pink frilled
gauntlet cuffs and beflowered hat.
The Kelso King lady dispensed greetings
from an aura of sapphire blue. Slim
Goldie Gray’s turquoise blues were worn
with an outsize black hat. Mrs. Hal
Capper (Maitland) was graceful in beige
and brown and a hat in the same color-
ings. Eileen Bucknell’s old silver brooch
was the right decoration for her navy
cellophane outfit. Mrs. Ellis Fielding
Jones was one of the few whose com-
plexion didn’t suffer from wearing a tiny
hat. The nut-cover was of dusty pink
and matched her dress. Myrine Collins
was another who wore small headgear
without misgivings. Nancy Mac Naught
wore white, and added a brightly-colored
shoulder scarf, hatband and belt for
effect. Mrs. Warwick Fairfax’s white
dress was topped with a dark-blue coat.
Her hat wore a navy crown and a white
brim. Janet Thatcher kept cool in green,
and Mrs. Spencer Brunton wore a Patou-
blue dress under a darker-blue coat to
watch her horse Gladswood run in the
Derby.
Those who flung the winter garments
of repentance in the fires of spring for
Randwick on Saturday had to put ’em on
again for the Metropolitan meeting on
Monday, for the climate switched back
with a vengeance and the day dawned
with the lowest October temperature
since 1871. About' 2 p.m. the sun shone
forth in sickly fashion, but few women
trusted his promise, and furs and other
stout overcoats covered dresses, while the
expensive new spring hats that were to
have delighted the world remained in
their boxes. The cold spell also put a
damper on the Six Hours’ Day proces-
sion, only 12 unions out of 60 being
represented.
Every tool of the trade excepting
printing presses and blue pencils was used
as a decoration at the Journalists’ Ball,
and of them all the most popular was the
fountain pen. The G.-G. and Lady
Isaacs, Acting-Governor Street and his
wjfe and the Lud Mayoral Parkers were
the night's honored. The president,
Alexander Gordon’s lady, brought her
guest, Diana Davidson, to see the fun.
Lady Poynter wore black satins, diamond
earrings and a glittering coronet. Isabel
Gullett, Catherin Grant and Josephine
O'Neill served at the saveloy stall.
Flaxen-haired Connie Marshall's black
velvets had long slim sleeves. Eric
Baume’s Mary wore mulberry laces.
Pat O’Connor and Mrs. Toby Brown were
in company. Mrs. J. E. Davenport won
the prize for the most novel table deco-
ration. Dolly Baverstock brought a
party, and five white-clad debs, made
their bow to Lady Isaacs.
Barbara Balls looks at you from this
George Johnston sketch. She is one of
Sydney’s popular young things, and how
she finds time for her music (she is
quite a good pianist and violinist), which
she takes seriously enough to sit for
exams., her dancing, swimming and ten-
nis is a wonder to all her friends. She
is also a performer of good works, and
her interest at the moment is bound up
with the Picnic Ball on Friday at the
Palais Royal. Here, in a garden of
roses, 1600 will unpack their hampers and
eat and dance and make merry so that
the coffers of the Sydney Day Nurseries
and the N.S.W. Home for Incurables
will be filled.
The Acting-Governor and his lady, she
in lavender and silver brocades, came to
the Dante Alighieri Society’s Ball for
Italy’s Consular-General couple, the
Marchese and Marchesa Ferrante. Every-
one stood to attention, first for the Italian
anthem, then for the “Giovanezza” and
again for “God Save.” Later, in an
atmosphere of Mussolini’s flag and many
camellias, Dr. Baccarini, president of the
Sydney Society, handed to the Marchesa
the coveted diploma and medal of the
mother club in Rome, as a reward for
the better understanding she has brought'
about between the two nations.
A long spray of Cattleya orchids was
worn by the Marchesa on her gown of
midnight-blue woven through with gold.
Daughter Virginia glowed in gold lame
over canna-lily-red crepes. Tina Benti-
voglio’s black taffetas wore a bustle
bow and a long train. There was a silver
thread running through Mrs. Leo Lyon’s
rose-petal-pink brocades. Mrs. Ferranti-
Passmore’s red laces covered a generous
heart. She dispensed hospitality to the
stranger, male and female. Mrs. T.
Fiaschi brought two young daughters,
Elisa and Olivia. Lute Drummond came
on after she, Jean, Alice Prowse and
Charles Nicis had put on “Lohengrin”
to an audience of the sex at the Women’s
Club. Mimi Healy wore a blue crystal
coronet in her hair, Miss K. Egan’s black
cape showed a silver lining, Josephine
Marks sat with Hilda Mulligan and broad
gold horizontal bars gave an air of dis-
tinction to Mrs. Baccarini’s black jacket.
George Aalbers, the pro. at Kos-
ciusko, came to the Ski Council’s ball at
the Blaxland Galleries. Possibly the
yellow-and-red coat-of-arms of the
Polish Kosciusko family after which
our Kosciusko was named was quite
familiar to him, but most of the others
saw' it for the first time in its place of
honor above the band dais. Crossed skis
were on every side. They formed a
picket around the
stage and with the
badges of the dif-
ferent clubs deco-
rated the pillars of
the gallery. The
Moreton Lodges
came up from
Towong Hill (Vic.)
for this flutter, and
Mrs. Lodge’s
brother, Tom Mit-
chell, and H. G.
Lambic were
among those who
carried away silver
cups won at the
winter sports.
Stewart Jamieson,
Jean Edwards and
Bernine Gilder
were the secs.
Anne Gordon’s
blue laces hung
fr o m diamente
shoulder straps;
Elsie Ebbsworth's
tulles were as white
and crisp as snow
just fallen. There
were red curlicues
on Phi 11 ip a
Stephen’s white
organdies, gold
motifs on Dorie
Harley’s black taf-
fetas, and Mrs. Les
Holden’s blue-and-
red-flowered crepes
were girdled with
a mauve sash.
The cheeriest party of the week was
that of the Society of Artists, staged
among its pictures at the Education Gal-
leries. Even the latest-comer got a spot.
President Syd Ure Smith, John Lane
Mullins, daughter Barbara and Maud
Sherwood gave a hand-shake that meant
they were glad you came. Everyone
wanted a word with “Jo” Collins. Cedric
Ashton waved the baton that told the
orchestra whether he wanted the music
served slow, low or loud enough to
drown the voices. Mrs. B. E. Minns,
who had had an operation the week
before, persuaded the doctor and matron
to let her leave the hospital for an hour
or two, so that she could say she had
been there. Dave Souter brought two
daughters. Mrs. Will Ashton wore
printed crepes, and Hera Roberts added
a berthe of creamy lace to her black
crepes. The C. L. Joneses, just back from
Canberra, talked to everyone of the
beauty of the spring flowers they had
seen. Margaret Allen wore field-flower-
spattered satins. Mrs. Alan Potter was
glimpsed. Mrs. Scott-Wainne’s beautiful
tulips were admired. Isabel Mackenzie
went home flushed and happy over the
congratulations of fellow-artists on her
exhibits. Mary Edwards plaited her hair
coronet-fashion around her head.
The death of Mrs. Simpson, wife of
Dr. E. S. Simpson, W.A. Government
Mineralogist, sends the memory of musi-
cal Sydney back to the days when she
(then violinist Muriel Griffiths) and her
sisters, Sydney’s Mrs. Walter Swinson as
pianist and Mrs. Mario Fagiolio (now
living in Milan) as 'cellist, were the Aus-
tralian Trio, favorites on the concert
platforms of London and the Continent.
The sisters had wonderful success. All
their London recitals were under the pat-
ronage of our present Majesties (then
Prince George and Princess Mary).
Muriel, who had a vivid personality, was
considered one of the most brilliant violin-
ists of her day, but never once did she
regret the career which she gave up at
its zenith to marry Dr. Simpson. Great
sympathy is felt for the husband, mother
and two sisters who are left sorrowing.
Clare Dennis and Melbourne's Lesley
Thompson were cheered when they ar-
rived at Mark Foy’s on the night of their
return home from the Empire Games.
There were more cheers when the men
appeared, and there was individual
applause for each as their names echoed
through the room when they were pre-
sented to Chief Sec. Chaffey. Hilda
Marks, who was president of this wel-
come-home ball, wore black velvets.
Mrs. Chaffey wrapped herself in flame
chiffon, and Mrs. H. K. Maxwell, wife
of the team’s manager, swirled black
laces. Mrs. S. Hemplon and Mrs. W.
Chambers, in black chenille georgette,
were others on the big committee who
worked for the success of the night.
Quite half the Nellie Stewart Memorial
matinee audience was made up of elderly
men and women who found it laborious
to climb the stairs, especially those to
the top gallery. They came to show
their appreciation for happiness received
in days gone by at the hands of the
Sweet Nell whose photograph at' the door
of the Royal all that day had been
arresting the eye and memory of the
busy passer-by.
Inside, the theatre was full of memo-
ries. Nellie’s photograph was on the
programme ; fragments of her favorite
operas were sung by Vinia de Loitte in
the white dress worn by her on the stage
when Miss Stewart took her last curtain.
Another favorite, “1 Was Dreaming,’’
from “Ma Mie Rosette,” was sung by
Gladys Moncrieff. She and Robert
Chisholm brought “The Maid of the
Mountains” and “The Beloved Vaga-
bond” with them. Madge Elliott' and Cyril
Ritchard filled the theatre with “Blue
Mountain Melody.” Doris Fitton and
Albert Collins played the quarrel scene
from “The School for Scandal.” George
Wallace, wanting to join the Force, and
Cyril in his patter about Peter filled the
house with merriment. There were
scenes from “Sweet Nell of Old Drury”
with daughter Nancye in her mother’s
role, in her dresses, in her wigs, at her
harpiscord. It seemed at times as though
the mother’s mantle had fallen on her.
shoulders, such a whimsical and appeal-'
ing orange-seller she made.
One of the nice things about this
matinee was the way every artist in
Sydney wanted to help. Those who
didn’t get on the programme came to
applaud those who did. The Mayoral
lady sat with the Dick Stewarts in one
box. Cyril Ritchard’s mother and sister,
Mrs. Vincent Goldrick, were in the oppo-
site box. Grace Lane and Gerald
Savory were in the crowd. Claude
Flemming stage-managed ; he also auc-
tioned a doll (given by Mrs. Mills)
which had been dressed by Nellie Stewart
and sold by her at her Radium Fund
matinee in 1926.
Mrs. Sterling Levis and Commander
Rolleston are the joint authors of “The

Chatter
Old Melburnians decided that the dark
panelling of Caulfield Town Hall is most
effective unadorned, so that their annual
ball revolved without streamers; a
monster Grammar flag hung over the
stage was the sole decoration. There
were 35 hosts to greet their own guests,
meet others and see that the official
people were well treated. Headmaster
R. P. Franklin, the John Rhodens, the
E. F. Atkins couple and the N. Mar-
shalls put in an appearance. Amidst
swish of satins, rustle of taffeta and
jingle of bracelets and sequined acces-
sories were Zelma Sprague in printed
organdie, Dorothy Eckersall in nettle-
green swathings, Margaret MacLeod in
a gold capelet over black, and Margaret
Neil-Smith in a twirly design of gold,
blue and beige. Geoffrey Allan, J. C. and
J. S. Campbell, H. G. Blanchflower and
K. A. and J. H. Thomas were a few of
those who lent a hand to give the party.
As a welcome for and as a means of
introducing the visiting oarsmen to Mel-
bourne girls, Mrs. Ernest Graham and
her son Jack gave a dance at Grosvenor.
The team, which comes from the London
Rowing Club (of which Jack Graham is
a member), will take part in the Cen-
tenary Henley Regatta. Mrs. Graham
wore pale-blue chiffon and lace which
drifted into a train as she stood beside
her son to welcome the guests. Among
them were Elizabeth and Anne Stawell,
Betty Caddy, Heather Mackellar, with
stiffened fins at the throat of her foamy
black net dress, Madeleine Mackay-Sim,
of Sydney, Joyce Keam, from across Bass
Strait, Neil Campbell, Stewart Embling
and Peter Wettenhall.
Mr. and Mrs. George Adams poured
sherry with “many happy returns” for
their niece Mary Armit, of Bihdi, Gipps-
land. Guests wandered between the
garden, where tables and chairs were
strewn under trees dressed in their new
spring raiment, to the lounge filled with
flowers from knight Edward Mitchell’s
Macedon garden. Miss Armit bore her
21 years with confidence emanating from
oatmeal romaine balanced with deco-
rative narrow pleatings at hem, cuff and
throat. Among those to wish her well
were Mary Russell, Mary Lindsay-Smith,
Peter Law-Smith, Roger Crivelli and Bill
Rigall.
Peggy McComas was given not only a
dance to celebrate her 21st birthday, but
a cocktail party as well, as a preliminary
to the evening frisk. Dr. and Mrs.
Sidney Plowman and Cecil Syme
arranged the “warming-up” at the Plow-
mans’ home in Frankston. Thence
guests drifted off to their own or one
another’s homes for a bite of dinner and
later met once more at Ranelagh Club.
The John McComas couple saw that the
rooms were gay with spring flowers and
that a birthday cake sat in frosty state
among pinky candles. Mrs. McComas
wore black, with a suggestion of pink
upon her cape draperies, and Peggy was
in clinging white satin cut with a snug
high neck and criss-crossed straps at
the back.
Standing on a platform against a back-
ground of sceptred, crowned and very
stout Queen Victoria, Lady Huntingfield
opened the Mabel Brookes wing of the
Queen Victoria Hospital. President of
the B.M.A. Dr. Gerald Weigall made a
speech as a “representative of the sex
which is barred from the hospital” and
“in the absence of a more desirable
speaker.” He talked about the way
women’s interests have grown, from get-
ting out inkstains to removing an appen-
dix (and they always could get things
out of husbands). The new wing is beau-
tifully equipped, and contains an out-
patients’ dept, and staff quarters. The
visitors wandered through dozens of
consulting-rooms, each with adjoining
dressing-cubicles, lockers, etc. The
operating-theatre didn’t look in the lease
grim. Its color scheme is deep-cream and
silver, it’s filled with new and interesting
gadgets, and is quite a cheerful place in
which to slide under a wave of chloro-
form.
Upstairs is a really attractive sitting-
room for nurses. Each nurse has her
own domain of a cosy bedroom, done in
pale-green, pink or floral chintzes. All
the doctors in the Queen Vic. are
women. The institution is run for
women and children, and is believed to
be the largest of the sort in the Empire.
Ten years ago it was a small building of
60 beds ; to-day it contains 430 beds for
in-patients and staff. The • money was
raised through the perseverance of the
women of Melbourne, and the new wing
was christened after the hospital’s presi-
dent, Mrs. Norman Brookes.
The first dress rehearsal of the Naval
Pageant took place one chilly afternoon
on the lawns behind the Leigh Falkiners’
tall green hedges. As many of the men
taking part as were able to snatch an
afternoon off from their work were
assisted by Mrs. Farquhar-Smith to
master the unaccustomed fastenings of
courtiers’ and country yokels’ costumes.
One bewigged gentleman whispered that
every time he bowed there was an omin-
ous creak; another announced there
was only one frail tape between his
gallant black costume and disaster. There
were, however, no casualties. Among
people who danced the minuet were
Lieut.-Commander Turner’s wife, Mrs.
J. Newman, Jimmy Paxton, very gor-
geous in mustard color ; Peggy William-
son, Betty Clarke and Lieut.-Commander
Ted Forrest, who discarded the heavily-
epauletted coat of Captain Cook to fill
in a gap among the gentlemen of fashion.
Queen Charlotte’s raiment being un-
finished, Mrs. Leo Quick made the best
of an Elizabethan costume,’ and by her
good carriage retained a very trouble-
some crown. Her consort, George 111.
(Commander Spooner), was detained in
Adelaide “on urgent naval business.”
Maisie Cowper was one of the liveliest
of the South Sea maids whose swishing
grass-skirts moulted a russet-tinted layer
over the Falkiner sward. The poor little
nymphs shivered between dropping their
coats on the edge of the lawn and get-
ting warmed up to their rhythm in green
chiffon. Lieut.-Commander Perry was
one of the bumpkins who frolicked in
highly successful suits made from dyed
hessian and hectic socks with Yvonne
Cox, Josephine Webster and other coun-
try lasses. Commander A. D. Nicholl
directed things with amazing patience,
and Commander J. Burnett was a mine
of information upon the pictorial ihter-
pretation of naval history.
Visitors to the Early-Victorian Exhibi-
tion, to be opened on October 8 in the
Commonwealth Bank Buildings, will be
given a peep at the background of life
in the middle of the last century. Under
the poke bonnet which undoubtedly
brought a flush of excitement to the
demure cheek of some young lady of
society many years ago is Ruth Ward,
one of the girls who will display early-
Victorian fashions during the exhibition.
Miss' Ward is wearing a gown of
Madonna-blue corded silk, its period the
’forties. It comes from Glasgow. Every
stitch of the elaborate garment (for it
is very grand, though the photograph
allows for only a suggestion of its frills
and flounces) was made by hand, and
on such a different plane were prices of
clothing at that time that the cost
was only 10s.! The owner of the dress
is Mrs. A. E. W. Clarke. Miss Ward is
the second daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
D. Ward, of South Yarra. She’s an old
girl of Lauriston, and with an interest
in sport and dramatic work pursues the
life of a modern miss of 1934. Her por-
trait is by Spencer Shier.
Though we’re still in winter tweeds as
a protection against the cold north winds
it is spring in Melbourne, for growing
things know all about the right time of
year. Even the laziest deciduous trees are
budding (and once they start they seem
to become completely green overnight),
and flowers are making a brave show.
Last November the Ivan Gutmann
couple moved into their beautiful new
home in St. George’s-road, Toorak, and
are now rejoicing at the results of care
and expert attention to their artistically-
planned garden. Another of Mrs. Gut-
mann’s interests is the Collingwood
Creche, but she makes time for bridge,
and seldom misses an important race
meeting. She and her husband have
travelled extensively and lived for four
years in the Argentine. It’s a Jack Cato
photograph.
As a trial flight for daughter Beth,
who will spread her debutante wings
during the Royal visit, Mrs. Norman
Paxton gave a large late-afternoon party
in Darling-street. Outside a howling
north wind plucked hats and skirts with
vicious fingers; arrivals whose cars were
parked some distance from the portals
of No. 9 looked neither to right nor left
as they made a beeline for the cloak-
room. For it was a very well-dressed
occasion, many of the guests snatching
the opportunity of a biggish party to dip
into their new spring wardrobes. Mrs.
Paxton struck her color note in misty-
greys, her georgette gown with its lace
pailettes being worn under a long cape
of dull-surfaced crepe. Her daughter’s
dusty-pink color scheme included a frock
with pleated fish-fin ornamentations, a
swinging coat and a hat of malleable
brim and suggestion of crown. Mrs.
Lionel Praast wore violet, and a feather
plume clung to her hat. The F. C.
Muirheads were there, she with a nut-
meg blouse peeping from under the lapels
of her fur coat. Among those who inter-
spersed dancing with cocktails and “gob-
lins-in-blankets” were Mary Drake-
Brockman and Tempe Falkiner, both in
black ; Susan Staughton, in provocative
navy and white dots ; Naomi Kennedy,
placid in dove-grey; Janet Moran,
spring-like in meadow-flower crepe;
Captain Barbour, Dr. Robin Orr and
A lister and Max Cooch.
The Stawell lady gave a welcome-home
for her daughters Elizabeth and Anne
on the afternoon following the mailboat’s
arrival. During their 18 months’ holi-
day abroad the girls made the acquaint-
ance of Helen Simpson, who is married
to their cousin, Dr. Denis Browne. They
found this authoress a charming woman
who likes to plan intriguing meals for
her guests. By a methodical system of
filing menus beside guests’ names as they
are “got off” she never gives anyone
the same dish more than once. Rabbit
occasionally emerges from her kitchen,
but never when Australians are expected
to a meal.
A charity matinee often means an in
different programme, but excellent enter -
tainment was turned on at the Princess
for the Broadmeadows Foundling Hos-
pital. The theatre was packed, and
Delysia was the glittering star. Her price
less scrap of sophistication, “Ninon Was
a Naughty Girl,” came between a 1919
piece of sentiment and a love ditty “that
I have sung, rnon Dieu, in 1917.”
Bobby Philp and Ella Scutts, she rattling
gold coins on white chiffons, displayed
a waltz, a quickstep and a rumba
Charles Norman talked, among other
things, about a king who left his crown
on a rusty nail; Marjori and Harry Ris-
tori became a red-hot Hawaiian and a
weird and wonderful dying duck, and
male impersonator Hetty King smoked
a pipe while she searched for her lost
youth in Piccadilly. Harry Thurston
had the laugh on the audience after a
long, loud and very wet piece of elocu-
tion about merchandise. He invited the
“kind people” who would like to receive
his photo, to leave their names in the
office and the next day he’d send round
a doctor to look at their brains.
At Philip Hargrave’s third concert
there was a special microphone on the
stage which, through the combined
wizardry of the Telephone Department
and the A.8.C., conveyed sound waves to
one person only. She was Mrs. Gordon
Lane, of Camberwell, who has been an
invalid for 11 years.
Young Philip has a talent for acting.
One evening last week he wriggled into
a black lace frock and high-heeled gold
shoes, got some assistance for making-up
his face, hung his ears and his neck with
pearls and, under a wide-brimmed hat
trimmed with marguerites, paid a call
upon the guesthouse where he and Miss
Garnaut are staying. Housemaid and
oldest inhabitants were completely taken
in and rather overwhelmed at the “over-
dressed hussy.” The youngster’s most
riotous impersonations are of Laurel and
Hardy.
The five abos. were the greatest draw,
especially for small fry, at the Outback
Exhibition. They sat on the stage (clad
not in war-paint but in ordinary dusty
clothes) outside their mia-mia. lon
Idriess sent a collection of curios, includ-
ing string games. Missions arranged ex-
hibitions of abo. crafts, and the National
Research Council demonstrated how its
work will dovetail with the work of the
missions.
Anthropologist W. C. Groves thrilled
small boys with his explanation of a
medicine man’s shoe. It’s more like a
bird’s nest, but its tracks put' the fear of
40 devils into Black Brother. Girls’ in-
terest was divided between gorgeous
feather headdresses and the “pirrah”
bark article used for carrying food or
babies. Among speakers during the
week were several padres, Prof. Elkin, of
Sydney, Mrs. T. T. Webb, of Arnhem
Land, Charles Barrett and William Hat-
field.
George Aiston keeps a fatherly eye on
the five blacks, whom he chaperoned
from the north-west of South Australia.
They live in St. Kilda, cook their own
tucker and are reticent about their im-
pressions of big cities.
Mrs. Arthur Amies has returned in
good time for the centenary from her
holiday in England and north of the
Tweed. For one of her first welcome-
home parties she wore black and white,
with a spray of white violets resting on
her lapel. Mrs. Lewis Carnegie and
daughter Mavis distributed teacups
against a background of irises mixed
with marigolds and silver candelabra
supporting gold candles.
Prof, and Mrs. -A. E. V. Richardson,
of the Waite Research Institute, Adel-
aide, are spending a few days here en
route for Canberra. Whenever she’s in
Melbourne Mrs. Richardson makes the
most of an opportunity to eat in one of
the Italian restaurants in Bourke or Exhi
bition streets; thus Mario’s was her
choice when Mrs, Fleming Dunstan sug
gested a luncheon party. The Richard
sons will be back in Adelaide for the
Duke’s visit, and may return here later.
The H. F. Creswicks have returned
from abroad. Daughter Sheila, who has
been at school in Paris, was presented
by her mother at the June court; son
Alex, has been at Oxford.

Tl\e only type of
circulation that
has real worth is that which is constant and
embodies the confidence of readers. These
attributes are possessed only by the daily
newspapers whose circulations are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-

bought because people want them in their

The daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New Zealander that even in times of
economic stress he continues to buy his
morning daily, so valuable is it for the
information it gives, both in its news and

De Witt’s Antacid Powder, the
wonderful quick-action remedy for
indigestion, is winning golden opinions
everywhere.
Thousands of people who had been
sufferers from chronic stomach pains
and all the serious illnesses caused by
indigestion, find that here is a new
scientific preparation that really does
what is claimed for it—relieve the
miserable weakening pain caused by
indigestion, and give back a healthy
“eat what you like" appetite.
Of all the host of letters that the pro-
prietors of De Witt’s Antacid Powder
for Indigestion have received, the fol-
lowing is one of the most vitally human.
READ THIS MARVELLOUS
LETTER OF THANKS
“ Some time ago,” says this sufferer
from terrible indigestion, “I was
troubled with nasty bitter fluid arising
from my stomach and disliked my food.
I was in continual pain and soon had
to cease work and take to my bed. I
was sent to hospital for examination
and an operation for gastric ulcers was
performed. Later I tried to resume
work, but I had to go to bed again.
At last I heard of De Witt’s Antacid
Powder. I got a supply and this
seemed to stop the sickness so I decided
to persevere. After three days 1 was
able to leave my bed and get out-of-
doors. Before the first tin was com-
pleted I was able to enjoy my meals.
Pain and sickness were gone and I was
able to take long walks without
discomfort. I am now feeling better
every day."
That is the written statement of
Mr. J. Harris, of 2 Dale View, Dale
Road, Derbyshire. In face of this will
you stay in misery and danger from
indigestion ?
De Witt’s Antacid Powder soothes
the digestive organs, cleanses away
impurities and poisons that cause
acidity, griping pains, sour stomach,
flatulence and after-mealtime pains.

Quern,” to be produced by Beryl Bryant
at the Savoy on October 17 and 18. This
one-acter is based on “Myths and
Legends of the Celtic Race,” by the Com-
mander’s father, and “The High Deeds of
Finn.” It centres in the introduction
of the quern (or mill) into Ireland, but
into the fantasy the authors have woven
a delightful love theme. Tableaux of
Chinese ivories, Sheffield silver salt-cellars
and Dresden china figures will round out
the programme. Money goes to the Free

An honor came to the Royal Art
Society last week when Dennis Adams,
pupil of Syd Long, won the £l5 prize
offered by the City of Sydney Commit-
tee for the best design for a decorated
float for the procession to be held dur-
ing the Duke’s visit. The competition
was open to students from all the art
schools of Sydney. The drawing is a
beautiful piece of work, showing the
high buildings and towering flats of the
city, figures symbolic of the city’s pro-
gress and, in the background, Governor.
Phillip and some of his men beaching
their boat.
The welcome-home parly for Govern-
ment House’s “Giff” on Monday will
make history in the house of Romano.
It will outshine all others in the bril-
liancy of its lights, its cabaret turns, its
ballet and its panto, (played by the boys
of the village). That there’ll be a doctor
in attendance is reassuring. The Doone
girls are doing their bit; so are Rene
Riano and Minnie Love. An outsider
can’t get a card for love or money ; 300

the almost undecipherable and certainly
quite unforgeable signature of Jo Fallon.
THE LITTLE SISTERS.
WESTRALIA.
A truckful of wildflowers was sent
down the Midland Line, and its cargo
converted the Embassy ballroom into a
bushland scene for the Hunt Club Ball.
Kangaroo-paws and smokebush semi-
concealed the orchestra on the dais, and
the loges and supper tables were vivid
with the native flora. After “John Peel”
had been sung, scores of pink-coated
huntsmen lined up to dance Sir Roger.
President J. J. Poynton’s lady spattered
trained blue velvets with silver lame;
Mrs. Victor Harwood’s parchment pebble
crepe with its hint of black velvet made
a co-secretarial appearance with Mabel
Teather’s red-white-and-black-sttiped taf-
fetas ; a crystal clasp at Mrs. A. E. Joy-
ner’s back held her black Chantillies to-
gether ; Mollie Manning was slim and
trim in cerise satins ; Mrs. Pelloe draped
creamy lace over satin ; and Molly Mc-
Enroe combined black satin with silver
lame.
The. State Symphony Orchestra forsook
the classics to dispense dance music at
the Embassy for the Symphony Ball,
when “Duffy” Newton’s baton conducted
the largest band that has yet supplied
music for a Perth hop. The ballroom
was void of decorations, so the crystal
chandeliers and lanterned pillars were
seen as the architect intended. Connie
Sullivan and S. Gilkison’s exhibition of
the Brazilian carioca was a highlight.
Organiser Mrs. Craven Griffiths’s brown
mesh laces were fashioned in Paris ; Mrs.
Rod Preston’s pastel blues hung from a
yoke of rising- sun pipings; Joan Stowe’s
woodland green crepes were tied at the
nape of the neck; Viola Bathgate
whipped her cream chiffons to a froth;
Lurline Drummond’s Spanish coiffure
topped sunburst satin, and Mrs. I. Masel
ran a silver stripe down her blush-pink
matelassd.
Allan Gamble and Nancy Wilson kept
a tryst at Wesley Church, Claremont.
Her filmy Honiton lace veil was haloed
with lilies of the valley, and fell over
rich magnolia satin, which clung to the
knee and then burst into a triple-pointed
train. Winifred Gamble and Louise Has-
sen’s twin peach-bloom laces were shot
with silver and trained with plea tings of
organdie; their silver girdles, knotted
’neath their sheaves of gladioli, fell a-
dangling to the tips of their toes.
Nancy’s sister, Mrs. O’Keefe, welcomed
the guests at her Claremont home with a
riot of golden ranunculi nestling against
her amber georgettes.
The Campion lady went to the Karra-
katta Club for morning-tea and a warm
welcome given by the members. Acting-
president Mrs. C. P. Smith, sporting
tailored marine tweeds and an ivory
pleated jabot, presented the guest of
honor with a posy of crimson carnations
and maidenhair fern, which looked well
against the dark-brown tweeds with
belted three-quarter coat and golden-
brown fox fur.
Signor Constantino and his Signora en-
tertained members of the Italian circle
on board the motor-ship Viminale with
an informal evening of dancing, deck
games and singing. Vice-president Mal-
colm Levinson thanked the captain, Sig-
nor Cav. Giudetti and the Vice-Consul
for Italy for the hospitality.
A horde of hockey players and their
followers bullied off at the Parish Hall,
Claremont, for the association’s dance.
Medico Tregonning’s lady umpired the
show in Nile-blue and silver matelasse ;
Mrs. Griffiths Bowen was on the wing in
black laces and georgette; Ruth Clif-
ton’s Patou-pink satins were seen on the
field; and Marjorie Shann, Evaline
Parker, Pat Lang, Pat Roe and Betty
Blythe were in the centre of things.
Winifred Carruthers, first general sec-
rectary of the Y.W.C.A. in W.A., and
Olive Jones, formerly groundwork secre-
tary of the local association, stepped off
a liner at Fremantle on their way from
London and hurried up to headquarters
in Perth. The 14th anniversary of the
establishment of the Y.W.C.A. buildings
and advent of the visitors were jointly
celebrated at a luncheon.
Peggy, youngest fledgling of the Jim
Butchers, Nangetty, is the latest member
of the ring brigade; the emblem was
bestowed by Barney, youngest son of the
R. Ellis Woods, of Toorak, Melbourne.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
The Institution of Engineers gave a
i very bright dance and bridge-party in the
Uni. refectory, prettily decorated for the
occasion. R. H. Chapman (chairman)
and his wife received the guests, Mrs.
Chapman’s black crepe de Chine toilette
being trained and worn with a black
velvet cape. The Goodman lady was
gowned in black chiffon velvet. Mrs.
E. W. Holden chose cyclamen chiffon,
and Mrs. F. Lancelot Parsons midnight-
blue matelasse. Married folk predomi-
nated.
To enable members of the commit-
tees of the Victoria League to meet
the new president, Lady Dugan, Mrs.
T. E. Barr-Smith gave an at-home at
her residence, Birksgate, Glen Osmond.
The garden was a blaze of flowers, and
the reception-rooms were full of frag-
rant blooms. Miss Murray, Mrs. Edgar
Brown and Mrs. John Baker, vice-presi-
dents, were among the guests.
In aid of the Mothers and Babies’
Health Association, a gift garden party
was held in the beautiful garden at the
residence of Mrs. A. Mac Diarmid,
Knightsbridge. A strong north wind
added to the anxieties of stall-holders.
Lady Dugan, in a smart navy ensemble,
was received by Mrs. Herbert Kay, Mrs.
Malcolm Ashwin and Frank Rymill.
After watching the dancing of Madame
Vera van Rij’s pupils, the vice-regal
visitor was entertained at afternoon-tea
in the drawing-room, where the floral
decorations were gorgeous.
The same afternoon Lady Dugan was
tendered a reception at the Returned
Soldiers’ Club, Angas-street, the music-
room being crowded with members of
the S.S. and N. Relatives’ Association.
Lady Dugan is patroness, and at her
request there were no speeches.
The marriage of Henry, elder son of
Mr. and Mrs. H. L. Rymill, of Lockleys,
to Alleyne, only daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. J. F. Downer, of Glenalta, Stirling,
took place at St. Peter’s College chapel.
The reception after the ceremony was
held at Glenalta. The bride was gowned
in flat cream crepe with a girdle of gold
cord, cream velvet flowers outlining the
neckline. The cream lace veil was held
in place by a narrow wreath of orange-
blossom. The three bridesmaids, Jean
Watson, Margaret Campbell and Kather-
ine Rymill, were in daffodil-yellow
georgette, with cape effect, their wide-
brimmed hats wreathed with yellow and
blue flowers with long ends of yellow
ribbon issuing from beneath the brim.
TASMANIA.
St. Virgil’s Ball in the City Hall, which
was elaborately decorated, attracted
about 600 dancers, and the galleries were
crowded with onlookers. Lady Clark
received six debs. —Sheila Carroll, Mary
Timmins, Kathleen Hilyard, Ivetta Wil-
liams, Vanda Murtach and Monica
O’Brien. The official party included the
Premier and Mrs. A. G. Ogilvie, Arch-
bishop Hayden, the Lud Mayor (the
Mayoress was down with ’flu) and the
Military Commandant and Mrs., Whit-
ham.
Lady Clark opened the Arts and Crafts
exhibition in the Town Hall, where she
was received and taken round by the
president, L. Dechaineux, and his wife.
Rug-making and handweaving were
much to the fore. Lady Clark sent for
exhibition a screen, hand-embroidered
on cretonne.
Hilda Clark and Geoff Swan were
made one at St. Luke’s Church, Rich-
mond. The bride, who is as dark as the
’groom is fair, was in heavy parchment
satin, cut in long plain lines, with tight-
fitting long sleeves, and the veil of old
Honiton lent by Mrs. Murdoch was a
specially beautiful feature of her turnout.
Lynn Drury, the only ’maid, was in pale-
pink tulle, long and excessively frilled,
with a little flat plaque of leaves worn
on one side of the head. After the cere-
mony guests were entertained at the
Clark home by Dr. and Mrs. Clark and
the bride’s sister.
Though the Amateur Horticultural
Society’s daffodil show was held on the
only really wet day we’ve had for weeks,
the bulbs had nearly all been so sheltered
and cared for that they were perfect,
and it was the loveliest display imagin-
able. The Governor and Lady Clark
were keenly interested, she being a great
gardener. W. Jackson won the grand
championship this year, and with it many
other prizes.
Hobart Rep. Soc. pleased all sections
of its audience with “The Farmer’s Wife.”
Norman Booth and Mrs. Haddon-Cave
had the most difficult roles, and carried
them off lightly. A pat on the back is
due to Robert Hudspeth for his study
of old Coaker.
The new Girls’ Hostel in Salamanca-
place, recently opened by Bishop Hay,
started with one lonely chick in the nest,
but no doubt others will follow. The
hostel was established to house girls
who are out of employment or have to
put in time between jobs and want a
decent place to lodge in meanwhile. Mrs.
Selwyn Finlay is supervisor.

The Hidden Trick.
A certain amount of dash is required
for a good bridge player. He must not
hesitate to make a sacrifice bid when the
occasion demands it, to save a still higher
score against his side. Faint-heartedness
in defence is equally to be avoided.
There is a type of player who forms a
picture, right or wrong, of the declarer’s
hand from the bidding; he makes his
lead, and as soon as the dummy is laid
down he is apt to regard the contract as
lost. A hand given by Mr. Sydney Lenz
illustrates the value of thoughtful play
against what looks at lirst sight to be an
unsinkable contract.

After some rather optimistic bidding
on the part of East-West, the contract
went to South at four spades doubled.
At first glance it looks as if this must be
made. South should lose only two clubs
and a diamond. But East was a player
of courage and resource, and quickly
grasped the only chance of upsetting
South.
The club eight was led by West, won
by East’s king, and on the ace West
dropped the deuce, marking the nine
with South. Here is where East did his
thinking. Both West and North (dummy)
have no more clubs. If West can be
induced to remove one of dummy’s
honors in trumps, he (East) must make
a trump. Then if West holds any top
card in diamonds the contract is set.
East gave his partner no chance of mak-
ing an error. A small club was led so
that West must trump. If North does
not overruff, a spade or a heart lead still
upsets him. If he beats West’s ruff with
an honor, then East makes a trump and
West a diamond.
The moral is: Never throw in the
towel.
O
Melbourne News.
The N. S. Wales ladies’ team, due to
travel south in a week or so, will
meet some doughty opponents. An
unbeaten Victorian four, consisting
of Mrs. N. McCance, Mrs. A. A.
Chisholm, Mrs. G. Sarasin and Mrs.
Mier, looks a difficult proposition. How-
ever, Captain Rosich and her three col-
leagues can be relied upon to put up
an excellent fight.
The final of the Melbourne Pennant
competition is to be fought out between
Mr. V. Champion’s team and that cap-
tained by Mr. S. Seargeant. From these
will most likely come the representative
four to oppose the N.S.W. men’s team.
Owing to the resignation of Mr. H.
Humphery, the four from N.S.W. will
consist of Mr. J. Griffiths, Mr. C. Cad-
wallader, Mr. Bertram Flohm and Dr.
H. L. Tonkin.

Book Reviews.
The Buller-Alniack’s Bridge Contest
(London ; Buller; 3s. 6d.). I have re-
ceived from Colonel Buller a most in-
teresting account of the match between
his team and one representing Almack’s
Club. Out of the 100 hands played, 76
are analysed by Col. Buller and Captain
Kempson. I still believe that, in his
staunch advocacy of British bridge at all
costs, Col. Buller overlooks the necessity
for the partnership spirit and the team
spirit. Brilliance and “card sense” are
all very well, but in a game of precision
even the cleverest exponent must know
what his partner means when he makes
a bid. In auction this was not so abso-
lutely necessary, and a perusal of this
book forces one to the belief that a
number of English players are still play-
ing auction with contract scoring. How-
ever, this book not only provides inter-
esting reading, but throws sidelights on
the players’ temperaments which explain
a number of the varying results.
Modern Contract Bridge, by Frank
Cayley (Auto Press; 3s. 6d.). In these
hundred-odd pages will be found every-
thing for the beginner and a good deal
for the near-expert. Mr. Cayley is not
only a well-known writer and teacher
but a practical winning player. The
approach forcing system of Ely Cul-
bertson is used as the foundation of his
method, but is not adhered to slavishly.
I must disagree with him on minor
points, but he is too modest when he
says that he has advanced little that is
constructive. His book is full of meat,
and, though all the bidding steps are
explained concisely and clearly, Mr.
Cayley credits his readers with a certain
amount of intelligence. I can recom-
mend this book to all grades of contract
addicts.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
A.J.S. (Kangaroo Point, Brisbane). —
Your suggestion as to the use of frac-
tional bids is, as you say, revolutionary.
Unfortunately, under the present laws, if
a player made the bid of half-a-club, he
would be called upon to make his bid
sufficient. This would destroy the rhythm
of your proposed bridge conversation,
which makes Culbertson’s approaching
look like a desperate charge. In the
example given, I have tried to see how
the North-South players can avoid call-
ing a slam under any system, but have
failed to find a way.
T.M. (Woonona, N.S.W.). —There is
no difference whatever between rubber
and competition bridge ; it is purely a
matter of tactics. An experienced com-
petition player should play an excellent
game of rubber bridge, unless the stakes
are so high that they worry him.
T.E. (Forbes, N.S.W.).—AII conven-
tions are founded more or less on com-
monsense. They are tried out in dupli-
cate matches, where records are kept.
Subsequent analysis reveals whether they
pay or not.
O.N. (Maryborough, Q.). —The method
of scoring to be used in the coming inter-
state contest is practically the same as
at rubber bridge. Three hundred points
will be awarded for a non-vulnerable
game and 500 for game vulnerable. Part
scores will be doubled or not, by arrange-
ment between the captains.

Tells of an Editor Who Wouldn’t Lie:-
The Protit of Truth
BY TONY BOWES
Drawings
by
Scorfield.
Heaps’ IOUTER had confided to me:
“I’m going to start a new
kind of paper. One that’s
Wr not afraid to tell the truth ;
|ijjj jTji. °ne that’ll be absolutely
impartial, favoring neither
one section nor the other. That’s what
the people want to-day. They’re fed up
with the existing type of papers that
color their matter with the political con-
victions or business expedients of the
proprietors. My paper will be entirely
different. L will inaugurate a new style
Of journalism. You watch me succeed.”
Well, he commenced —at Gidyer, try-
ing it out on the country dog, so to
speak. Every week he posted me copies
of his current issue. Perusing these, I
could see that he was undoubtedly stick-
ing to his intentions. Some of the write-
ups of local happenings, while graphi-
cally informative and at times amusing
as reading, were cer-
tainly not designed
to bring peace and
comfort of mind t >
those written up.
SOME months
passed before i
happened into Gid-
yer. A Parliamen-
tary by-election was
on at the time, and.
interested to find
out my friend’s atti-
tude towards poli-
tics, I made my way
after breakfast to
the address of the
“Weekly Chronicle,”
a rather dingy,
single-storey build-
ing in the outhouse
style of architecture.
“What d’yer wan-
ter see him
for?”
On entering I was confronted by a
small counter backed by a wooden par-
tition, completely blocking out all access
to the rear, except through a small door-
way, the door of which was closed.
When I knocked on the counter a big,
surly-looking bloke emerged from be-
hind the partition and demanded to
know what I wanted.
“I wish to see Mr.
Souter.”
“What d’yer wan-
ter see him for?” he
snarled.
“Tell Mr. Souter,”
I said, “that a friend
of his wishes to see
him.”
“Why didn’t yer
say so at first?
Watchername?”
I handed him my
card; he smelt it
and retired behind
the partition. A
moment later Souter
emerged. Lifting up
the flap of the coun-
ter he bade me
“I’ve set out to found a paper that
is different.”
enter, and ush-
ered me into a
small office.
“Why do you
keep that brute on the premises?” 1
asked him. “He’ll turn away business.”
“Sorry if he offended you,” replied
Souter. “but he’s a necessary evil, I’m
afraid, just as much as this
is,” pulling a massive-looking
waddy out of a drawer in
the desk.
“Why, how do you
mean?”
“Oh, just the result of my
new policy. Some of the
people round here have not
quite accustomed themselves
to my style of journalism.”
“I thought you would be striking
trouble before long.”
“Trouble’s right,” said Souter. “Have
a look at these,” throwing me some
papers, “and this,” pointing to some
sticking-plaster patches on his head.
I GLANCED through the papers. They
3 were two separate writs for libel, one
claiming £5OO, the other £lOOO damages.
“You’ve certainly stirred up a heap
of worry for yourself,” I commented.
“Who gave you the hiding?”
“Someone who disagreed with some-
thing I wrote about him. That’s why I
have our friend at the door. I’m not
keen on being knocked about.”
“Apart from these, how is the paper
doing?”
“The circulation’s
growing rapidly. I
tell you, Andy, if I
can stick it out I’ll
make it a howling
success. These,”
picking up the writs,
“are only to close
my mouth. The
cows won’t take
matters any further.
They know I’ve got
too many proofs.
The only thing wor-
rying me is the ad-
vertising. It’s been
dragging a bit. That
reminds me,” call-
ing out loudly:
“Charlie.”
The surly one entered.
“Yes?”
“Smithers and Durkin wilt probably
be dropping in to see me some time dur-
ing the day. If they’re on their own
you can let them in. But let me know
first. While they’re here keep around
handy outside in case of emergency.”
CHARLIE withdrew, favoring me with
a grin, evidently intended to be
friendly, but only serving to make his
appearance even more formidable.
“What’s the meaning of this?”
“Who are Smithers and Durkin?” I
inquired. “Expecting trouble from
them?”
“Durkin’s the Nationalist- candidate
for the by-election: he’ll probably feel
annoyed at a few remarks I appended
to his election advertisement. Have a
look for yourself, ft only appeared in
to-day’s issue.”
He handed me over a paper and
pointed out a three-quarter-page adver-
tisement setting out Mr. Durkin’s claims
for the seat. It was couched in the usual
flamboyant election verbiage, condemn-
ing the same old bogeys, making the
same old promises. Underneath the ad-
vertisement, printed in letters as large
as those above, was the following notice:
“If anyone is fool enough to believe
that this man will, if elected, perform
what he promises, then to such person
we say, vote for Durkin by all means,
and have the satisfaction of knowing that
you’ve cast a vote for one who will
worthily represent your limited amount
of intelligence.”
“What,” I cried, “is your idea of put-
ting in this stuff?”
“I tell you,” replied Souter, “I’m not
going to change my ideas just because
they don’t suit the views of others. I’ve
set out to found a paper that is different,
and I’m going to keep on doing it, even
if I go broke in the attempt.”
“That won’t be long,” I remarked.
“Who’s Smithers? The Opposition
candidate?”
“No, that’s Milham. His ad. won’t
be in till next week’s issue. Smithers
owns a number of general stores around
the district. One of the wealthiest men
in these parts. 1 got a twelve months’
contract from him last week for a
double-page each issue. But if he thinks
he can break it, let him try! I’ll fight
him if it costs me my last penny.”
“What have you been saying about
him? Surely to goodness you don’t make
a point of blackguarding everyone that
advertises with you. You must be the
biggest fool under the sun.”
“He had some poor devils evicted
from some cottages he owns for non-
payment of rent the other
day. They’d been his tenants
for years, but they got out
of work, and the miserable
old skunk wouldn’t give
them the least consideration.
He had ’em thrown out into
the street. A man like that
deserves to be shown up.
The hypocritical old swine
with his sanctimonious hum-
bug ! Here’s what I said
about him.”
Turning over the paper in
front of me he pointed to a
flaring headline.
“Wealthy Landlord Evicts
Penniless Tenants.”
Underneath was a very caustic report
describing the eviction scenes, conclud-
ing with a contrast between the tents
that the evicted people would have to
occupy and the very comfortable home-
stead in which Smithers lived.
“That comes of telling the truth!”


PURPOSEFUL SAVING
Regular saving is as much a matter of habit as anything else.
The habit has to be cultivated, but, once established, it
becomes as positively mechanical as any of your ordinary
recurring actions.
The aim of a Commonwealth Savings Account is twofold.
Firstly, it is intended to lead you to provide, in the easiest and
least burdensome way, for an intended purchase or financial
security at a future time. Secondly, it is believed that sheer
self-respect will impel a Savings Account owner to carry out
his wise and cautious plan, to form, in fact, a thrifty habit,
to his own advantage.

“Of course the man is going to kick
against this,” I said. “I don’t blame him
either.”
“That’s a matter of opinion. But if
Smithers thinks he can use this as an
excuse to cancel the contract he’ll find
out his mistake.”
I was about to reply when from the
other side of the partition came the
sound of a loud voice demanding to see
Souter immediately.
“That’s Durkin,” whispered Souter.
PHARLIE, taking his time, put him
through a close interrogation, and
Durkin, judging by his voice, must have
been near bursting point.
The questionnaire completed, Charlie
appeared.
“Durkin's outside,” he said calmly.
“He wants to see you.”
“Show him in,” said Souter, “and keep
handy outside.”
Charlie went out
to usher in Durkin,
a middle-aged man,
who in normal
times,!should have
imagined, was a
rather dignified
personage. At the
moment his face
was distorted with
rage. In his hand
he held a copy of
th e “W eek 1 y
Chronicle.”
“W hat’s the
meaning of this,
Souter?” he roared
at once.
“Just what it
says, Durkin,” re-
plied Souter.
“I’ll sue you for
libel, you scoun-
drel, unless you bring out a special edi-
tion containing an unreserved apology.”
“No, you won’t, because it’s not libel-
lous, and don’t you call me a scoundrel
or I’ll have you removed.”
“You—you” spluttered Durkin.
“You’ll be sorry for this. You and your
rotten Labor rag! I’ll make this town
too hot to hold you.”
“I don’t think so,” replied Souter, still
very calm. “I’m never sorry for any-
thing I write. As for being a Labor rag,
as you term it. For your information I’ll
read you the comment I intend attach-
ing to Milham’s advertisement appearing
next week.”
He read from a paper he picked off
the desk :
“ ‘Milham is not even worthy of being
labelled a “has-been,” as he never merited,
at any time during his dull career, being
termed anything other than a party hack.
His nomination represents the reward of
long years of party servitude, and is
an insult to the intelligence of the
electors.’ ”
“That doesn’t put matters right,”
howled Durkin. “I demand that you
publish an apology!”
“Don’t worry yourself about that,”
replied Souter ; “I won’t. Besides, I won’t
publish my opinion of Milham if you
“I’m not here to talk about that!”
don’t keep quiet. Now, get out of here
if you don’t want to be thrown out.”
Durkin, still shouting threats of mak-
ing Souter pay for this, left the office.
WHEN he had gone Souter burst out
laughing.
“That comes of telling the truth.” he
said. “Perhaps it’s just as well I didn’t
read him my final word of advice to
the electors. He’d have had a fit. Here
it is.”
Picking up another piece of paper he
read:
“ ‘We would advise the electors, unless
they have a legitimate excuse for not vot-
ing, as failure to record their vote will
render them liable to a fine, to make the
vote informal, as a protest against the
political system which limits their selec-
tion to a choice between two nonenti-
ties, either of whom, if elected, would
be a disgrace to the town whose repre-
sentative he was supposed to be.’
“What do you
think of that?” he
concluded.
“There’s no
doubt about it,
limmy,” I told
him, “you’ve gone
off your head com-
pletely. How long
do you think you
can last out while
you go on antagon-
ising every influen-
tial person in the
town?”
“It’s like this,”
he said patiently,
“you’ve got your
way of doing
things and I’ve got
mine. Don’t forget,
as I told you, the
circulation’s grow-
big- Shush”—putting his finger to his
lips—"here’s Smithers.’

A Sharp-cut Drama of Suspense: —
PROMISE.
BY ALISON MCDOUGALL
He could not speak to her but with a
self-conscious snigger, writhing in his own
inferiority. Desiring her, he would not
dare to touch her. Afraid of her, cring-
ing to the old man. Lily-livered little
fool. .. .
1T was the old man’s habit to
sit in the shade on the veran-
dah between the hours of
the heavy station midday
dinner and tea, which he still called
“smoke-oh,” though it had ceased to be,
for him, a looked-for spell in a hard
day’s work. After his nap he would
light a pipe and sit hunched forward in
his chair, his face turned upward and his
head slightly tilted, with the listening, in-
tent expression of the blind or nearly-
blind.
He had had the old bay mare Car-
lotta put in the yard nearest the home-
stead, and he pretended to watch her
and the foal, though Fanny was sure his
rapidly failing sight prevented him from
seeing anything more than a blur of
the rich color of Carlotta’s hide as she
thundered past the near railings in pur-
suit of the scampering youngster. When
the old man heard the hooves drum-
ming and Carlotta's playful high neigh
of challenge to her offspring, he would
sit up straighter and give a curious little
half chuckle of pleasure.
If Fanny were passing, putting the
butter in the cooler, or in and out of
the kitchen superintending the black girl
who did the cooking, or carrying buckets
of water for the ferns which, in their
hanging baskets, helped to make the
verandah cool and pleasant, he would
call out:
“Hey, Fan. look at the youngster!
Fine little chap ; he'll do us proud some
day, eh? Gold Coin, by Sovefeign out
of Carlotta. Ought to do something with
a sire like that. And he’s showin’
promise already. Wouldn’t be surprised

if he wins us more races than his dam
ever did. Poor old Carlotta . . . but she s
done well in her time, eh, Fan?
“Yes, dad.”
He lived in the past and the future.
It was perhaps a result of his failing
sight that he counted so much on the
years ahead.
His daughter, his station, his horses.
THE bougainvillaea vine hung over the
white-painted woodwork of the house,
weighed down with its lustrous purple
flowers. Shadow and light were sharp-
ened in the intense heat; shadow under
the eucalyptus-trees in the yard quite
black, the light a dancing haze that was
painful to the eyes. The great clumsy
framework of the gate was like a picture
of a gibbet, Fanny thought, black and
sinister against the brilliant sky, and the
outer leaves of the snake plants at the
foot of the steps had gone quite limp
and dead, curling, falling over, lying
on the ground—the queer pale markings
that gave them their name making them
look like coiled snakes. The centre
leaves still stood up thin and straight,
like a forest of spears. A dry, hot
wind licked up the fallen papery bou-
gainvillaea flowers and rustled them along
the floor with a dry hiss.
Everything was static in the weary,
deathlike mid-afternoon pause that in-
tense heat makes necessary—everything
except the little foal, with its gleaming
golden hide, prancing and playing tire-
lessly in the yard.
FANNY was sitting in the other bam-
boo chair, some sewing in her lap.
It was not often that Fanny was idle,
even during siesta time. Generally she
was busy, somewhere within call, be-
cause she knew the old man liked to
have her near. But to-day she sat with
slack hands, staring ahead of her. She
was watching the foal, thinking almost
subconsciously how absurd his long legs
were, what a darling head he had. He
put his head down and prodded Carlotta
in the belly, finding her efforts at play
too tame for him. Then he jumped back
a step, clumsily, absurdly, half-alarmed
at his own daring, and rushed off madly,
tossing his head in bravado.
The old man stirred in his chair. He
had been asleep, and his pipe had
dropped from his open mouth, scatter-
ing ash down the front of his shirt.
“Come on, Gold Coin. C’mon, wee
laddie,” he muttered, half in a dream
still —the dream he had, waking and
sleeping, of the racecourse at Townsville,
with the Governor and all the nobs in
the stands, the green lawns and the
hydrangeas brilliant in the sunshine and
restless with people, and a bay horse
flying down the course with the field
streaming out behind him —another
horse than Carlotta, another triumph for
old Josh Heron, who used to keep a pub
in the town. That’d give ’em something
to think about. Josh Heron, who had
started as a penniless prospector trying
his luck with hundreds of others in the
first Towers gold rush of the ’eighties ;
who had struck it lucky and had the
sense to convert his luck into a paying
concern. (He had never put any trust
in lumps of gold dug from the ground,
just as, in these modern times, he put
no trust in lottery tickets and sweep-
stakes and such things. If you got a bit
of luck you were meant to use it, Josh
Heron thought—not waste it and go on
hoping for more. Providence might give
you a start, but after that it was up to
you.)
So he had put his luck into the best-
paying concern of the day—a food
depot on the goldfields—and had run
supply waggons from Townsville. Then,
before the rush was over, he had gauged
the right moment to pull out; had mar-
ried a sensible, hard-working woman
with a bit of money of her own ; and
together they had started a hotel in the
town. When the chance came, in a
bad year, to buy old Jamieson’s property
for a song, Josh Heron had had the
money. What though some people said
he had stocked the place mainly with
cattle stolen from his neighbors? That
was jealousy. Now, at sixty-five, he
owned one of the most flourishing cattle
stations in the North, and, what was
more, he could afford to deal in blood
stock in a small way, and race his own
horses. Not too bad.
PITY Lottie had died. She’d ’a’ been
proud to see Carlotta winning the
Townsville Cup for them three years
ago. Proud, too, of Fanny. Proud to
see her ordering the men about, tall and
assured ; and to see her cutting-out at
a muster —sharper, keener, a better
horseman than any of them, afraid of
nothing, racing after a runaway bullock
and throwing it with a dexterity and
neatness the men on the place could not
imitate, because they had not Fanny’s
quickness or grace, her watchful eyes
that no least movement among the
cattle escaped, her scorn of risks.
Prouder still perhaps, looking on as
her mother, to see her at the Race Ball,
in as good a dress as any girl in the
room had on her back, a flower in her
soft hair, and all the fellows chasing
after her for dances and crowding round
her in the intervals so that she didn't
know which way to turn. She didn't
give a snap of her fingers for the lot of
them. She laughed at them and teased
them, and as soon as the old man wanted
to go home she turned her back on
them and went oft with him.
But one of these days the man would
come along. He would have to be
pretty fine to satisfy Fan, the old man
thought, chuckling. He could trust her
to pick him the right sort of son-in-law
to carry on the place and improve the
stock and breed fine racehorses and fine
sons.
Lottie had died before she could give
him a son to carry on, but he could
trust Fan, and in the meantime she was
a better man than most men’s sons.
HE turned his dreaming face towards
the chair in which she sat; said
gropingly:
“You there, Fanny?”
She started from a deep well oi
thought in which her broad-browed,
strong young face had grown sullen and
heavy, brooding on the future. Not the
future her father thought about, but her
own future. Yet she had no future
except that: the place, the horses, her
lather. It was her life. She loved it.
“Yes, dad. Wanting smoke-oh?”
“Eh? Not time yet, is it?”
‘Well, almost four. I’ll see if Meta's
got the kettle on.”
She stood up, putting aside with a
firm touch of her brown, strong hands
the sewing she had neglected. The old
man screwed up his eyes to watch her.
She was quick, strong, sure, as good as
a man. As long as she could ride to a
muster, and stand up fearlessly to any
man who was fool enough to think her
sex made her a weak boss, she would do.
THERE was a clink of spurs, and Dick
Heron passed in the yard with a
self-conscious swagger, looking up, his
sly light eyes upon Fanny with the hot,
hungry look that had filled them lately
whenever he saw her.
Fanny, standing by the verandah rail,
both hands pressed down hard upon it,
stared back at him, but could not hold
his eyes. They slid away. Coward!
She knew that already, in imagination,
he had possessed her a hundred times,
but his mean little soul would not let
him meet her eyes. He could not speak
to her but with a self-conscious snig-
ger, writhing in his own inferiority. De-
siring her, he would not dare to touch
her. Afraid of her, cringing to the old
man. Lily-livered little fool, with his
ridiculous bandy legs in those tight rid-
ing trousers. He couldn’t even sit a
horse, and his skin was white and like
goose-flesh . . . She scourged herself with
her loathing of him.
But he would marry her. He would
snatch at the chance, no fear of that,
whatever conditions she made. Even if
he had not wanted her, he would not
turn aside from the opportunity of get-
ting his greedy useless hands on the old
man’s money.
Well, she would see to that. She
would see that the place came to no
harm, or the horses ... or her father.
THE old man could not see Dick, he
was too far away, but he recognised
the step, and frowned irritably. He was
not fond of his good-for-nothing rela-
tions, but he would never refuse any of
them a job. There were usually three
or four parasites fattening at his table.
A man had only to bear the name of
Heron, and old Josh tolerated him, how-
ever great a waster he might be.
This boy, now—Dick —one of his
sister Else’s boys—twenty-four, but good
for nothing. Never would be good for
anything. Afraid to soil his hands,
afraid of a horse, gambled and drank his
pay the minute he got into town. Mer-
ciful God, better a daughter like Fanny
than twenty such sons!
“Fan,” he said abruptly, sensing
rather than seeing that she was still there,
“how old are yer?”
She did not hear him. She was look-
ing at 1 the eucalyptus-trees where the
shade lay so black. There had beer,
grass under those trees in the spring,
thick and soft, and the cactus flowers
had come out at night like huge pale
stars. The petunias in the bed near the
verandah had smelled sickly sweet, like
lanoline, and there had been a soft
snuffling and restless movement in the
darkness from the little yard where
Carlotta was. She had leaned her head
back against the tree-trunk, feeling that
she could not breathe, for all the cool

freshness of the night air, because he
was close to her, because he was bending
his dark, small head over her. “Lovely
Fanny.” That was what he had said, and
his whispering voice had been like a sigh.
She had trembled all over. His very
presence engulfed her like the sea. He
was so tall, so finely made. When she
watched him walk slowly across the yard,
the swing of his hips, his lovely long
back, made her dizzy. His eyes were so
blue when he looked at her . . . Lovely
Fanny . . .
How soft his hair had been on the
nape of his neck. And his body—hard
and taut, but with the skin smooth as
silk. How strong.
“Fanny, are yer there? Do y’ hear
me? How old are you?”
«I\AD, do you hear me? Where's he
” gone? Why didn’t he tell me?
Is he coming back?”
“I dunno, Fan. Came to me last
night and said he’d had bad news from
home and could he go at once. That’s
all I know. Needn’t take on so, girl.
Willy Jackson c’n take his place—just
as good a stockman.”
“Yes, that’s . . . right, Dad. Willy can
take his place. Willy!”
IX/ITH a throat suddenly gone tight,
” she managed to mutter “Twenty,
dad.”
Standing there by the railings, secure
in her father’s blindness, she passed her
hands over her body, quickly, furtively.
Why had Mrs. Tilly looked at her like
that when she passed through and
stopped for tea on her way to town the
other day? Surely they couldn’t see
anything—yet? Surely she might have a
little longer. Just a few days, a week.
He might come back still. (But she knew
he would not come back. “Lovely
Fanny,” so lightly, caressingly —not “I
love you.”)
What was the use of waiting, risking
something coming to her father’s ears?
No, no. That mustn’t happen. She had
made her plans. She would see Dick
Heron to-night.
She could see Mrs. Tilly and the
other women looking at her with their
cold, rattlesnake. glances when she and
Dick went to town ; could hear them
whispering over their teacups.
“That Heron girl’s married her first
cousin. Such a fellow! Don’t tell me
she couldn’t ’a’ got something better than
him with her looks. Well, my dear, if
you ask me”
“Twenty, eh?” muttered the old man,
musing. “Why, when you’re twenty-
four, Fan, you’ll be running the place
on yer own. The old man’ll be too
blind to help you then. But maybe you’ll
’a’ found someone else by that time, eh,
Fan?”
THE bougainvillaea dripped its heavy,
lustrdus blossom down the white
wall and on to the floor ; the snake plant
wilted, but its inner leaves stood up
straight and fine, like a forest of spears ;
the black patch of shadow under the
eucalyptus-trees was like a bruise in the
hard glare of light on the bare
ground. The little foal kicked up his
heels and flirted his tail with prepos-
terous young self-importance. Fannv
put her hand to her throat.
“I’ll see about the tea,” she said, and
went indoors.
The old man dozed again.
The Story of a Smouldering Hate: —
THE BURNIG MOUNTAIN
BY J.H.M. ABBOTT
“Holy Ghost!” he
gasped, as he rushed
over the hot earth
after he had crossed
the rock that bridged
the vent of the in-
fernal fires below.
“God save us, /”. ..
THE fires of Australia’s only burning
mountain —rather a hill than a
mountain—are fed by the combus-
tion of coal seams, tilted at a steep angle,
which are identical with the Greta coal
measures lower down the Hunter Valley.
The fire is slowly moving southward ;
sulphurous smoke and great heat still
exude from a cavern in the side of a
low hill, which is locally referred to as
the Little Burning Mountain. If its rate
of progress has been as constant as since
white men first saw it, it has been in
existence for about 2500 years.
The blacks had no tradition of it, or
any explanation. Indeed, they preferred
not to discuss it at all. Whether it had
its origin in a simple bushfire or in some
other way we shall never know. There
is no way of solving the mystery. They
called it Wingen, which is derived from
fire.
IT was here just on 100 years ago that
* Mr. Bloody Mick Truelock got off his
horse and gazed with astonishment down
into the ash-filled hollow. The solid
earth seemed to be afire. Columns of
bluish smoke eddied up into the still air
and lost themselves thinly in the blue-
ness of the sky, veiling the indigo out-
lines of the Murulla ranges opposite and
the dark foliage of the ironbark forest,
with its undergrowth of tea-tree scrub,
which grew to the red edges of the burnt-
out track of old fires stretching up the
far hillside from the bottom of the de-
pression. His horse snorted in the sul-
phurous atmosphere, and pulled back on
the reins, causing Mr. Truelock to apos-
trophise him savagely in his characteris-
tic manner.
“Steady, you brute,” he growled.
‘lf I can well stand it, you can.
But, my oath, it do smell like th’
gate o’ hell! ”
Presently he led the frightened animal
into the timber on the flat to the east-
ward of the burning ground, and tied
him to a sapling. Then he began a won-
dering and somewhat awe-stricken in-
spection of the uncanny place, muttering
sanguinary comment as he trod gingerly
over the heated crust of earth that over-
lay the subterranean
furnaces. Near the
open cracks and vents,
above which the belch-
ing breath of the fires
caused the sunlit atmo-
sphere to eddy and
swirl in a faintly visible
fashion, the white
chemical, deposit of the fumes was
slightly tinged with the clean yellow of
sulphur, the smell of which, inhaled with
every breath, kept him in a state of
coughing and throat-clearing.
He felt frightened of the place, but too
curious about it to give way to his fears,
and slowly and cautiously he made a
progress all round the little hollow which
seemed to be the centre of the fire’s
activity. The fire was then, in 1832,
nearly a hundred yards lower down than
it is now, midway between the two low
peaks marking the southern and northern
ends of the mount.
On the eastern side of the hot place,
along the further slopes of a little gully
that ran up that way, the sandstone had
cracked in straight lines of cleavage,
and had terraced the hillside in a peculiar
fashion above the burnt-out seams deep
in the bosom of the mountain. Down
some of the gaping chasms that lay in
front of the perpendicular terrace walls
he peered with awe, and when he
dropped stones into them he could hear
the fragments clattering and rumbling
deep in the bowels of the earth. Whiffs
of heated air came up from some of
them, and occasional little eddies of sul-
phurous blue vapor showed faintly
against the dark green of the timber
that encroached on every side. He
plunged a dead branch into one of the
hotter cracks, and presently it was ablaze
with leaping flames.
“Hot!” he murmured. “ hot down
there. What a— — place for a cove to
fall into! Why, he’d be cinders
on th’ inside o’ half a jiffy!”
FOR an hour or more he prowled ab< ut
the strange inferno, peering curiou ly
into glowing chasms, and picking up
hot fragments of white, baked mineral,
and stones that sparkled with crystal-
line encrustations of yellow sulphur.
When at length he sought his horse the'
sun hung low above the tumbled indigo
of the undulating outline of the ranges
below. He rode down the way he had
come into the little creek that tinkles
through a narrow gap at the southern
end of the Burning Mountain. Here he

gave his horse a drink, and twisted round
in the saddle to take another look at the
tall column of smoke, tinged golden in
the last rays of the declining sun.
“My colonial oath,” he muttered
hoarsely, as he.gazed upwards over his
shoulder, “that’d be th’ place for Bill
Jenkins, d n him —down one o’ them
red-hot cracks? By God,” he croaked —
his throat still smarted from the fumes
of sulphur—“an’ it might be done, too.
It well might!”
As he followed the valley towards Dr.
Little’s homestead at Cressfield, where he
meant to pass the night, he continued to
ponder over the exceeding suitability of
Mount Wingen for the painful and fiery
destruction of Mr. William Jenkins, of
the Dartbrook —that same Red Bill who
had earned many hatreds that dated from
the years when he had been superinten-
dent of the convicts working on the
breakwater at Newcastle.
“I’ll do it,” he said to himself. “I'll
well do it —if it takes me a year for
to get him up there. There’s many as’d
thank me for such a good deed. They
—— well would !”
IT was a dull and rainy morning six
months after Mr. Truelock’s first in-
spection of the fires of Mount Wingen,
whefi he and Red Bill Jenkins rode up the
little creek. The sulphurous smoke hung
low above the crest, and its smell assailed
their nostrils as they turned out of the
creek-bed up the last ascent. They were
muffled to the chins in double-caped
overcoats, and the rims of their cab-
bage-tree hats dripped moisture on their
bridle-hands.
Early in the morning they had ridden
out into the rain from the yard of
Chiver’s Inn, down in Scone, and their
progress up the valley had been enlivened
by an interchange of reminiscences that
had passed away the period of their com-
fortless pilgrimage. Red Bill was a
large and somewhat pompous man, who
never allowed his present condition of
affluence and well-being to override a
past that had been strenuous and stern
enough. He bragged always of the time
when he had been what he called “Prin-
cipal ingineer o’ th’ breakwater at th’
Coal River.” He had done so all the
morning, innocently unaware that the
man whom he favored with autobio-
graphical details of the shameful tyran-
nies and cheatings incidental to his career
as a convict slave-driver had been one
of the driven slaves. Iti could not dawn
on him that, all the while, Mick’s more
murderous self was saying to his bitterly
vengeful self:
“You wait a bit, you cow, you
wait a bit!”
“Yes,” he had skited, “they ’ad a ’oly
terror of me, them lags ’ad. Desprit bad
’uns most of ’em was —but I ’ad ’em
cowed, an’ th’ Major—Jimmy Morris-
sett, y’ know, th’ Commandant —’e thort
no end o’ y’r ’umble, ’e did. Always
backed me up like a gent., did Jimmy.
I calls to mind one covey one afternoon
was a-workin’ at th’ end o’ th’ pile o’
rock we was pushin’ out to th’ Coal
Island—up to ’is waist in water, ’e was.
I come out on th’ end o’ th’ bank, an’
thishyer covey sings out to me, ‘D’ye
well want for to drownd a
man?’ So I makes ’im get into th’
water up to ’is neck, an’ kep’ ’im there
till sundown. An’ then I sends ’im wi’
two soldiers to the gaol for th’ night, an’
crimes ’im afore th’ Commandant in th’
mornin’, for insubordination an’ ins’-
lence. ‘Ho!’ says Jimmy, ‘so ye don’t
like clean sea-water, don’t ye, me good
man?’ ’e says. ‘Well, we’ll give ye four
dozen,’ ’e says. ‘That’ll keep ye from
a-catchin’ cold, me buck.’ Them was ’is
very words. Oh, a rare ’un was Jimmy
for a-backin’ up ’is orf’cers. Never no
dam’ nonsense about th’ Major.”
The snarl that twisted Bloody Mick’s
mouth was unobserved by Red Bill.
“Didn’t them coves never want to do
nothink to ye, Mr. Jenkins?” asked
Mick presently, when he felt sure that
he had control of his voice.
“Lor’ bless ye, Truelock —wot could
them scum do? There was sojers wi’
loaded muskets on th’ work, an’ they
knowed my word was law. No appeal
there wasn’t —for who’d they appeal to
but Jimmy, an’ d’ye think Jimmy would
ha’ took a lag’s word agin mine? Not
’im. Too much of a gen’leman, th’
Major.”
“But they might ha’ waited, Mr. Jen-
kins, mightn’t they? Why, there might
be some of ’em even now wouldn’t think
twice o’ doin’ ye a hinjury. Mortal sore
they must ha’ bin—some of ’em. Ter-
rible revengeful-like. Coves don’t easy
forget some things.”
THE ex-superintendent laughed scorn-
fully.
“Them!” he said. “Them poor trash!
Gawd love yer, Truelock, them wot
finished their time, they ’ad no sperrit
left for th’ like o’ that. Not a bit. Why,
sometimes I meets wi’ odd ones of ’em
now, an’ it’s ‘Good-day to y’r Honor, an’
I ’opes y’r Honor’s feelin’ well.’ 1 got
no fear o’ none o’ that sort o’ scum.’’
“You wait a bit, you cow, you
wait a bit!” chorused Mr. Truelock.
ON the crest of the rise, just above the
fires, they tied their horses up and
stood looking down into the fiercely
smoking hollow. Mount Wingen always
smokes more fiercely in damp weather.
Mr. Jenkins was amazed by his first
view of the Burning Mountain. He
found difficulty in expressing his aston-
ishment. His vocabulary was almost in-
adequate for the voicing of his senti-
ments of interest and wonder.
“Well, I’ll be d d!” he ejaculated.
“A werry rum sight—the rummiest I’ve
seed. Th’ flamin’ ground’s ’ot —’ot as
’ell! Gobless me soul, a werry rum sight
Who'd ha’ thought it now! ’Tis like th’
doorway to ’ell, ain’t it now?”
“It is th’ flamin doorway to hell, for
you, you cow!” mumbled Mick in
his whiskers as he stood behind Mr.
Jenkins, peering down into the seething
chaos of sulphurous smoke for the par-
ticular vent he had chosen on visits sub-
sequent to that first one of six months
before as the portal by which Red Bill
should step into Eternity.
“Come down with me, Mr. Jenkins,”
he said in a louder tone. “Come down
'and take a look into some o’ them there
cracks. ’Tis a fine peepshow, I do assure
ye. Well worth th’ trouble. An’ I’d not
mind wagerin' there’s precious gems for
to be picked up hereabouts. Th’ place
is a mass o’ crystals. Yaller di'monds
down there, I’ll go bail, if a cove ’ad th’
luck for to drop on ’em. You come
down and take a look. Never mind th’
smoke. I knows th’ way, an’ can lead
ye safe. Come down wi’ me now. - ’Tis
a sight for sore eyes.”
Mr. Jenkins was seized with a spasm
of coughing.
“Phew !" he gasped when he had re-
covered himself a little. “A stinkin’ place
—a dam’ brimstony place, eh? Well,
then, lead th’ way, Truelock—lead th’
way. I ain’t come all th’ way froin th’
Dartbrook not for to see all* wot Vto be
seed. Go on, I’ll foller ye.”
Cautiously Mick guided his prey dpwn
the hot slope, the - brittle white stuff
crumbling under their feet and their; wet.
boots steaming as they sank in y the
warm, loose surface. He knew a safe
way down to where a wide crack, the
rocky walls of which hissed when you
spat upon them, opened into a glowing
cavern of fiery, heat deep down below,
from which a muffled rumble of combus-
tion echoed to the surface.
“Tread careful,” he said. “Go steady.
’Twould do ye no good for to tumble
down on to- thishyer hot stuff, Mr. Jen-
kins. Foller me, an’ ye’ll be all right.
Steady does • if.”
Carefully he piloted Mr. Jenkins across
a bridge of baked sandstone spanning a
deep chasm from which a great draught
of evil-smelling smoke eddied up into
the rain and mist, taking his hand and
guiding him safely to the underside of
the crack in the hot rock. They stood
on the lower lip of the fearsome shaft,
and Mick guided his companion on to a
mass of solid stone, all crusted on its
outer edge with flowers of sulphur that
overhung the roaring inferno. He stood
himself a little lower down on the crest
of the ridge of heated gravel that made
a parapet for the fissure. That was
exactly the “take-off” he had long con-
templated for Red Bill, who had inno-
cently walked on to it in a fashion that
Mick found infinitely diverting. In a
few seconds he would push him over,
but there was something to be said first
of all.
“Jenkins!” he shouted.
RED BILL looked round, and his jaw
dropped as he saw the expression
on the face of the man who had brought
him to the edge of hell. There was no
mistaking its malevolence. With a gasp
of terror he realised that he could not
get back from where he stood unless the
other made why for him. Intuitively he
knew that he was in deadly peril. The
hot fumes choked him. He could say
nothing. And then he heard Truelock
howling words'of hate and terror at him
and felt his knees trembling under him.
“You dog!” shouted Mick. “You
stinkin’ hound o’ hell! Tis my
turn now. Ye put me in th’ water, did
ye—down there at Noocastle? An’ kep’
me there?, An’ got me flogged by —-
Jimmy Morrisseet? Well, by God, ’tis
flamin’ fire’s a-goin’ to be your lot —ye
—— cow! Th’ Devil’s down there a-
waitin’ for ye, Mister Red Bill
Jenkins. I’ll tell ’em how ye died —I’ll
let-others know who worked on th’
breakwater. By God, I’ll” ——
A sudden scream of terror ended his
farewell speech to Red Bill. The ground
under his feet, the crest of the sloping
earth, was caving in. The rains had loos-
ened a few feet of its overhang, and a
great crack suddenly appeared below
him. The bank fell in, and all Red Bill
heard was one piercing yell of agony as
Mr. Mick Truelock went down into the
chashi amid a smother of hot dust and
dirt:
‘‘Holy Ghost! ” he gasped as he rushed
over the hot earth after he had crossed
the rock that bridged the vent of the
infernal fires below. “God save us—l
could smell th’ roast meat of ’im!”


FALSE TEETH ARE A GREAT
INVENTION, BUT KEEP YOUR
OWN AS LONG AS YOU CAN
-
False teeth often follow Pyorrhea, which comes to four people
out of five past the age'of 40.

Who knows
how serious
Pyorrhea can
become?
There’s hardly a person whose mouth at some time in life isn’t threatened
with Pyorrhea, dread disease of the gums which comes to four people out
of five past the age of forty.
But only those unhappy men and women who needlessly wear false teeth
to-day are in a position fully to appreciate how serious this infection can
become when permitted to go unchecked.
For, as it progresses, it softens the gums, spreads poison throughout the
body, loosens teeth in their sockets until your very health demands their
extraction.
Don’t wait for the symptoms that may lead to the loss of your teeth. Start
at once using Forhan’s for the Gums.
A Dentist’s Dentifrice for Scientific Care of Teeth.
Pyorrhea cannot be cured by Forhan’s or any other toothpaste. Science
blames it on many causes, including diet, physical condition, crooked teeth
and tartar.
Everyone who values his teeth should see his Dentist at least twice a year.
Modern dentistry can do a lot to prevent needless trouble in your mouth.
In your home, however, your teeth are your own responsibility. It is up
to you to give them the finest care possible.
Forhan’s is the formula of R. J. Forhan, D.D.S., who for years specialised
in the treatment of Pyorrhea.
This dentifrice is unique in that it contains the benefits of an ethical prepara-
tion developed by Dr. Forhan, which thousands of Dentists use in the
treatment of the gums.
Don’t Wait for Trouble .
Remember —Pyorrhea may lurk in your mouth for years before beginning
its real work of havoc. Start using Forhan’s to-day. Even if your teeth
are sound and your gums are firm, do all you can to keep them that way.
False teeth are a great invention, but you want to keep your own as
long as you can. Do not wait for trouble before you start using Forhan’s.

SHEEPSKINS FOR BOOKBINDING
Instead of casing its books in orthodox cloth binding, The Endeavour
Press has tested the possibility of using tanned Australian sheepskins
for the purpose. The result is a remarkable credit to local crafts-
manship. A special autographed and numbered edition of Brian
Penton’s “Landtakers” has been produced in this richly unique tun -
ing. Specimen books can be viewed in Sydney at Dymock’s, David
Jones’s book counter, Moore’s Book Shop and Preece s Book op.
As the edition is confined to 23 copies only, all first impressions, it
will doubtless be a source of interest to collectors of limited and
special editions. The price is two guineas each, and Bulletin rea ers
who would like to procure one of these valuable books should write
to any of the above retail shops or direct to
The Endeavour Press, 252 George Street,
Sydney.
