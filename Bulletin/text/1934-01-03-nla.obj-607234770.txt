'■ has " fen in the world’s news
( thousand years, and since
■■ ’"Aiso he has attracted more
dtp a _ than. e v er. Hatred reached a
any the other day
wncti inc Government proclaimed that
Christ was an Aryan and that children
were to be instructed accordingly in
future. Inevitably scores of writers are
trying to explain the phenomenon. Most
of them claim to be unbiased, but few
are. The Jew has been a kind of per-
manent enemy subject in some countries
fpr centuries ; he is discriminated against
in the U.S.A., and even in tolerant Eng-
land anti-Semitic gibes have become part
of the language. The writers*of the books
reviewed below hate the methods of
Gaius Caligula Hitler, as one of them
calls him, and they are not anti-Semites ;
yet they recognise that’there is a case
for anti-Semitism. Their arguments
should interest readers in this country,
which has been so fortunate in its Jews
that untravelled Australians find it hard
to understand how anyone can object
to Jews.
Jews in General
H. S. Ashton, author of The Jew
Bay (Philip Allan ; 65.), begins with an
admission that “the finest type of Jew
is perhaps the finest type of civilised man.”
Howris it that this race which produced
the most sublime Being who ever walked
the earth should be typified in the minds
of millions by Shylock and Fagin,
uairers, profiteers and gangsters? His
answer is that there is no such thing as
a Jew in the sense even that ethnogra-
phists talk of an Englishman or a
Frenchman. The race is inter-bred with
people of every creed and color, so that
black Jews may be seen in one hemi-
sphere and flaxen-haired Jews in another.
I*t is environment that counts.
Put a Jew in a Polish or Levantine
ghetto and his descendants will be cring-
ing, money-hungry outcasts as long as
they are there. With a small shop in the
Mile End-road the Jew will remain a
tribesman, timid and ill at ease with
members of the master race, but he may
blossom into a racing man in a small way,
a. card-player, a cigar-smoker, a lover of
rich food. His sons will dress gaudily for
their Sunday-afternoon visits to the West
End, and perhaps marry Christians. One
of the sons may have great ability, or a
stroke of luck. He becomes rich, buys
a house in Grosvenor-square, a country
place and a racing stud. Or perhaps his
gifts lie in another direction; he invades
Hollywood and organises a gigantic film
company, or he goes in for art and be-
comes an Epstein, for science and be-
cetaies an Einstein.
Mr. Ashton stresses that through all
these changes—and even through the
modifications of type and character
•aused by intermarriage with Gentiles —
the Jew remains fundamentally un-
changed. The strain keeps reappearing,
and those who possess it never quite
assimilate. Wherever they go there is
vague hostility, and in backward com-
munities the feeling turns periodically to
frenzied hatred.
Jealousy? No ; the Jew isn’t unduly
successful even in England.
Occasionally we have had a Jew on the
judicial bench. There are no Jews in the
diplomatic service; no more than can be
counted on one's fingers occupy highly-placed
posts in the Civil Service —the real govern-
ment of the country.
Mr. Ashton points out that the«s are
no great Jewish shipowners or owners
of steel-foundries, and that even in finan-
cial circles names like Norman and Mc-
Kenna predominate.
Anti-Semitism, he says, is founded
partly on the Jews’ mysterious exclusive-
ness (“in this respect their superiority-
complex outdoes any pride of Nordic
race”) and partly on the internationalism
which is implicit in their origins. It is
remembered that Marx came to London
to finish “Das Kapital,” that Lenin and
Trotsky used Switzerland as a refuge,
that Bela Kuhn
appeared when
his native land
was in difficulties,
and so on. “The
Jew is not
trusted.” Yet no
civilised country can get on for long with-
out a Jewish leaven, and no uncivilised
country can hurt Judaism in the long
run.
The Jews are a peculiar people; they are,
in truth, in their lower ranks a vulgar and
alien people, b'/it they remain a people of
such character and potency that they survive
and multiply.
German Jews
Vernon Bartlett says in Nazi Germany
Explained (Gollancz ; Dymock’s ; 5s.): —
Although I disagree absolutely and entirely
with the German Government’s Jewish policy,
and have said so to every influential German
I have met since the Hitler revolution, I can
understand it to a certain extent.
Post-war Germany is often cited as an
example of the way a nation in trouble
is battened on by its Jews. The Nazis
claim that Jews were chiefly t,o blame
for Germany’s “fourteen years of abom-
inable Marxism.” Anyhow, by the time
that disastrous era was nearing its end
Jews were prominent everywhere, and
had been for some years. There were
nine Jews in the first revolutionary Gov-
ernment. A few years ago 15 Jews are
alleged to have shared 718 German direc-
torships ; in Berlin 50 per cent, of the
doctors and more than 50 per cent of the
barristers were Jews ; 89 per cent, of the
stockbrokers and 95 per cent of the
theatre directors were Jews. Rightly or
wrongly, Jewish financiers were said to
have made fortunes by gambling in
valuta during the inflation.
Many world-famous Jewish intellec-
tuals —Einstein, Feuchtwanger, etc. —are
internationalists and pacifists. Ethically
their position is unassailable ; but “an
integration of the National idea and the
Social idea is tfle characteristic post-war
development in Europe.” International-
ism is out of fashion even in Russia.
The natrons don’t want idealists, how-
ever saintly, as leaders ; they want real-
ists, or at any rate men who can impose
themselves on the people as such.' Hence
Hitler. It would be preposterous to com-
pare this posturing ex-house-painter on
personal grounds with an intellectual like
Rathenau, whose assassins are now being
honored by the Nazis ; but Hitler stands
for a cause—tight nationalism —with
which is bound up almost every political
dogma that German Jews are supposed
to dislike.
Australian Jews played a glorious part
in the World War, and Jews did as well
as any other section in Britain; but both
these writers claim that Jews, as a race,
dread warfare and will go to any lengths
in reason to avoid it. The Germans
say that “18 per cent, of the German
soldiers and only 7.5 per cent, of the
Jewish ones fell in the war.” There is
little war propaganda in British com-
munities, so the pacifist tendencies of
Judea cause no ill-feeling when they are
displayed. It is different in those Con-
tinental countries which lost territory in
the World War, and which can only hope
to regain power and wealth by another
war. These are the nations that are now
persecuting their Jews.
In any case, both writers agree, anti-
Semitism is latent' everywhere, and always
will be till Jews become nationals with
a country which they are ready to live
and die for. Irish emigrants and Euro-
pean kings have suffered for their in-
ternationalism, and the Papacy was
attacked by every belligerent nation,
Catholic as well as Protestant, in 1916-17.
No true loyalist trusts an internationalist,
and one of the effects of the war was to
divide the civilised world into nation-
ettes largely inhabited by loyalists, and
entirely surrounded by supposed enemieSi
Red Page.
The Gangster Peace
Lord Riddell’s An Intimate Diary of
the Peace Conference and After (Gol-
lancz; Dymock’s; 18s.) casts startling
lights on some of the men who were
largely responsible for the world’s present
troubles. A significant incident occurred
on the first day of the conference.
There was nothing to show that this was
a momentous day in the world’s history. Then

THE FREEZING UNIT
will last indefinitely, and needs no adjustment.
After heating, it gives a dry, frosty cold for 24
hours. The Freezing Unit is suspended inside the
cabinet, connected by a stout pipe to the chemical
container, which hangs outside. Every morning
the Freezing Unit is lifted out and heated as
directed. When it is cooled in the tank, a white
frost appears, and this complete refrigeration
continues for 24 hours.
ECONOMICAL!
The cost of maintenance is surprisingly small.
One pint of kerosene is used each day for heating
the Freezing Unit, and this is your total cost.
There are no parts to be replaced or machinery
to break.
ATTRACTIVE, economical, labour-saving and very hygienic.
These chests are ideal for all refrigeration requirements.
The dry, frosty cold keeps all foodstuffs crisp and fresh. Hand-
some in appearance, very simple and easy in use and no machinery
to wear out or break. It is the most effective and economical
freezing chest in use.
THE CABINET
is very attractive, wax finished in Maple.
The interior of Porcelain Enamel. A rubber
gasket on the heavy lid makes the box per-
fectly airtight and ensures perfect insulation.
Note also the Nickel-plated Brass Fittings,
which protect the Unit from damaging the
outside of Cabinet and the Porcelain Lining
when the Unit is being removed and re-
placed (see arrows).
THE CAPACITY
There is ample storage space measuring 24in.
long x 18in. wide x 19in. deep. Two re-
movable wire trays are very useful and add
to the efficiency of the interior, making it
easy to store eggs, milk and other foodstuffs.

suddenly I heard behind me the insistent and
prolonged note of a motor-horn. It was
Clemenceau in his Rolls Royce driving to
Versailles at 50 miles an hour, one gloved hand
on each knee and “a smile on the face of the
Tiger” that made one feel that the drama was
really beginning.
This note of exultant pride in what may
be called Tigerism keeps recurring
throughout the Diary. The leading
characters nearly all suggest malefactors
—and not particularly intelligent male-
factors either —quarrelling over the loot.
The most sympathetic figure is naturally
Lloyd George—the O.C. Lord Riddell’s
gang, so to speak. The two had points
in common, the most important being
that they were both solicitors. They
agree more than once on the advisa-
bility of treating Germany like a bank-
rupt estate ; an asset to be nursed. But
the smiling tigers of France are too much
for them, and for the others who, on
ethical as well as business grounds, favor
a peace that will leave the defeated coun-
tries with a hope in life. We see the
Boches being driven to destruction with
hardly a protest.
President Wilson and Bonar Law are
the exceptions. They appear as men of
goodwill, with a sincere wish to see jus-
tice done and an almost pathetic belief,
at any rate in the early stages of the
conference, that their colleagues share
their Christian sentiments. Poor Wilson
seems to have been unaffectedly simple.
The President is a quaint bird. This after-
noon he came from the conference room and
gave instructions for someone to telephone for
his typewriter. We conjured up visions of a
beautiful American stenographer, but in a short
time a messenger appeared, bringing with him
a battered typewriter on a tray. By this time
the conference had finished. The typewriter
was placed in a corner of the conference
room, and the President proceeded to tap out
a long memorandum.
Wilson and Bonar Law were dying men
at the time, and they evidently knew it;
but in this kind of struggle they would
have been no match even for such a re-
latively insignificant figure as Australia’s
W. M. Hughes if they had been in rude
health. Idealism was as out of place at
Versailles in the spring of 1919 as at an
Australian pony meeting.
It is easy to understand Lloyd George’s
charm from this book. He makes homely
jokes, sings hymns, gives imitations (he
is said to be a born actor), plays golf,
talks incessantly and well, all with a sort
of boyish exuberance ; and behind it are
vast capacity and knowledge. On this
evidence his epitaph should be: “He had
everything but character.”
This was a stage in his career when
nearly the whole official world of Eng-
land was busy truckling to him. Even
the arrogant Birkenhead implores the
diarist “to remove from his [L.G.’s] mind
any feeling which may have been en-
gendered by false and malicious reports
that I have been caballing against him.”
Soon most of his adulators were to turn
and bite the hand with which he had fed
them. This knowledge on the reader’s
part adds piquancy to Lord Riddell’s
story, but it also adds to the sordidness
of its atmosphere.
In addition to the splendid full-length
pictures—of Foch and his Irish friend
Sir Henry Wilson; of Bonar Law and
his antithesis Churchill —there are some
interesting small ones. That of the young
careerist Sassoon, for example, who
uses his millions to entertain everybody
with a pull. Lord Riddell emerges as a
cheery human individual with plenty of
dry wit. Only once does he seem to
lose his sense of humor—when he says
to Sir Auckland Geddes. “You have
fought in two wars!”

Can Artists Be Preachers?
I did not say (R.P. 20/12/’33) that the
literary artist was not a propagandist•
he is a propagandist of the first order.
But in the best literary artists, and it is to
them I referred, the lesson is inherent, not
preached. Chekhov’s tales, in which not
a solitary problem is solved but every
social problem is stated magnificently,
probably did as much to bring about the
Russian Revolution as Karl Marx.
Whether Marx’s solution was one which
Chekhov would have approved of we do
not know because Chekhov did not pre-
tend to be a sociologist. He was a
specialist doing a particular job. Marx was
a specialist doing another kind of job.
Chekhov reveals in his letters that he was
thoroughly well-informed about his coun-
try’s institutions and their appalling rot-
tenness, but he insisted that the literary
artist should confine himself to the job
that he could do better than anybody else
—namely, to reveal society, not as it was
conventionally understood, but as it
actually was.
By the ingenious device of crediting
Shakspeare with the opinions he puts into
the mouths of his characters “Red Page”
proves to his own satisfaction that the
Bard despised the mob. Certainly in
“Julius Caesar” he depicted the mob in
no flattering guise, but in “Coriolanus”
he did the same for the aristocrat, so, by
“Red Page’s” reasoning, he was simul-
taneously an authoritarian and a demo-
crat.
That Swift and Milton indulged in pro-
paganda is beside the point. So did Tol-
stoy, and all the worse for him. His plays
on the evils of vodka and sex were bad
art, though they were possibly good tracts.
M. G. S.
There is nothing ingenious in crediting an
author with the opinions of some of his char-
acters. It is an old-established critical method
everywhere, and perfectly legitimate when legi-
timately used. “M.G.S.” misused it (R.P.
20/12/’33).
Assume that Priestley meant to present liis own
solution to the problem of poverty amidst plenty
when he made a character say, “If I’d my way
I’d give every unemployed man four pounds a week.”
Here Priestley was credited with economic
views which he obviously doesn’t hold on the
strength of a stray remark thrown off by a
negligible character.
It is when certain opinions are found in a
number of works, and always in the mouths
of important characters, that they become sig-
nificant. In this way it has become a truism
among Shakspearean commentators that “the
Bard,” as “M.G.S.” brightly calls him, despised
the mob. He constantly reveals this prejudice
(which was shared by most of his fellow-play-
wrights and Court friends), just as he con-
stantly reveals his pride in England, his dis-
like of the Puritans who disliked him and his
works, and so on.
“M.G.S.” couldn’t have hit on a more un-
fortunate example than “Coriolanus” as proof
that Shakspeare was a democrat. Shakspeare
was handicapped by knowing no more of Latin
than “M.G.S.” does of Russian. He had to
depend on translations. He got the story of
“Coriolanus” from North’s “Plutarch,” and
exaggerated Plutarch’s scorn of the plebs. In
this play the people are condemned as dirty,
craven, “hares and geese,” and much more.
Shakspeare’s Coriolanus has two outstand-
ing characteristics, devotion to his mother and
hatred of mobs. Despite his bragging he is
shown as a hero —a fitting mouthpiece for
Shakspeare—and, of course, he was a hero.
As Plutarch wrote: “Natural wit and a mighty
heart stirred his soul to do great things.”
That such sublime English artists as Milton
were preachers is very much to “Red Page’s”
original point, which was, not that a single
Russian epileptic didn’t preach, but that nearly
all British writers of genius did. They “unveil
sores provide remedies.” A famous critical
tribute to Shakspeare in decline (“What lessons,
too, he preaches; the same lessons he has
preached all his life-repentance and forgive-
ness.”) is true of nine-tenths of them, and will
stand. “M.G.S.’s” pontification (“It is not the
business of the artist to provide remedies: his
sole business is to state problems”) is just
modernistic studio patter.
RED PAGE.
Mentors of the Masses
My Sunday newspaper arrived just
after I had read an article in an English
review entitled “That Million Sale”; and
my emotions, as I examined the unwieldy
local product, were exacerbated by the
steady blare of a neighbor’s wireless.
The writer of the article asked, “Is it
idle to hope that some day the readers
of the ‘popular press’ will refuse to be
deceived? Is it idle to hope that some
day journalists will refuse to serve up
daily flapdoodle and half-truths to a
public they despise ? Fairness and
honesty are things to be dreamed of, not
virtues to be cultivated. Sex and sen-
sation, competitions and cant, are in
the saddle.” The papers to which he
refers are creating in the minds of thou-
sands a distrust so intense that soon only
the sporting results and the court verdicts
will be trusted. Papers of the sort “are
building up circulations by exploiting
religions, selling pornography under the
cloak of moral indignation, searching the
past and present for ‘stories’ that shall
hide salaciousness in the capacious
bosom of ‘human interest.’ Papers pro-
duced by cynics for half-wits and snobs.”
The advertiser is the villain behind the
scenes. Circulation must be secured at
all costs. So we have insurance schemes
to persuade the people that they are
getting something for nothing, and beauty
and film-queen competitions to snare
empty-headed girls.
In London there are four “popular”
penny dailies in the million-sale running,
and all are degradations of journalism.
The ten best-known London and provin-
cial non-popular papers have a net cir-
culation of not much more than a million
among them. These papers cost more
than a penny, so price enters largely into
the public’s choice of the “popular”
paper.
In Australia the position is dif-
ferent. Here we find the good and the
bad at the same price. If the good are
to maintain their standard, and the bad
to be forced to raise theirs, there must
be a steady demand, as our journalist
puts it, for “less froth and more sub-
stance,” and, as he adds, “especially
from the women.” He asks if the women
of to-day realise the low opinion held
in newspaper offices of their mentality?
They are “not even credited with half-
wit, let alone capacity to think.” Is there
not waiting, for the newspaper that dares,
a big sale on the basis of intelligence ?
Or must “popular” papers for ever be
allowed to feature sex and fashion stuff
as part of the price to “get the paper
into the home”? “If that is the case,”
this English writer decides, “then Eng-
land deserves all that is coming to her
—collapse and decay.”
What are we, here, going to do about
it? Australians who buy a Sunday news-
paper because they want to know if any-
thing of importance has happened since
the previous day are also compelled to
buy, at an increased price, a paper which
boasts of being half a dozen papers in
one, with sensational picture stories,
a magazine section, and a colored supple-
ment, most of which is idiotic. What a
murdering of trees is there to produce
this welter of pages, among which we
grope to find the few items of any real
interest. Why suffer the proprietors to
tell us that this swollen monstrosity is
what we want and have created by our
inexorable demand?
The patrons of a type of journal which
St. John Ervine described the other day as
“a blend of Mr. Chadband and Crippen”
are paralleled as regards mentality by the
pathetic ones who turn on the wireless
for breakfast, and then listen all day to
the miscellaneous programme, varied by
the affected bleats (or rasping twangs)
of the announcers, till all capacity for
independent thought has been chattered
out of their brains.
How are we to be delivered from these
plagues ?

A Satchel of Books
Pavements and Peaks, by Anthony
Bertram (Chapman and Hall; 7s. 6d.}.
A travel book and not a travel book.
The author sets out to write his impres-
sions as he wanders through Germany
and Austria, and chats about modernism,
sightseeing, air travel, nudism, anything
at all. The book is a delight. Some of
the most interesting bits are written
about places the writer has never*seen,
nor wants to see. People, pretty girls,
old women, innkeepers, guides, interest
him more than places. A number of ex-
cellent photographs enhances the value
of the book.
Peacocks’ Feathers, by John Lindsey
(Chapman and Hall; 7s. 6d.), is dull
reading. It is about an English cathedral
town. An old woman is turned out of a
pub she has run for years, and the dean
dies of old age. Nothing else happens.
The cathedral dominates everybody. The
bishop’s wife rebels because it has left
no room in his life for her. People in
Low Town grumble because the dean
gets a large salary and is too old to
notice their misery. With his death
The Cathedral triumphed again. People who
had grumbled forgot their complaints They
were nothing, less than nothing, now that some-
thing had happened at the Cathedral It was
supreme. It was complete—the one certain and
stable thing in life Its workers hovered
round it, giving their lives to it.
None of the characters live, not even
the bishop’s wife, and of the others we
are only given glimpses here and there.
The hero of Montana Rides, by Evan
Evans (Cassell; 3s. 6d.), is disappointing
to the confirmed Wild West fan. In
the first place he hasn’t got a name. He
likes Montana best, but he’s The Kid
all through the book. The work is un-
satisfactory in other respects. The Kid
can shoot all right, but he doesn’t put
up a decent gunfight in the whole piece.
He hasn’t even a favorite horse:
The Kid spurred the mustang ahead. It
was not a big horse, nor a fine one. It was
the sort of range mustang that has a roached
back and a ewe neck and a lump of a head.
Montana cared neither for looks in a horse
nor for a smooth gait.
Shades of Hopalong Cassidy! Who ever
heard of such a thing? Still The Kid can
do a good job in ways. He tricks that
greaser Rubriz good and proper, brings
Ruth back her brother, and is all ready
to hit the trail again, but “She’s that
kind of a girl.”
The Carpenter’s Tool Chest, by Thomas
Hibben (Dymock’s ; 55.), is a copiously-
illustrated work dealing with the evolu-
tion of hand tools. It demonstrates “how
very little, since things were made, things
have altered in the building trade.” So
little have they altered since the begin-
ning of the iron age that kits of tools
discovered in 2000-years-buried Pompeii
contain everything the modern carpenter
or joiner finds essential. The saw, the
chisel, the plane, the hammer, the square
and the plumb-line were old before Pom-
peii was built. The brace-and-bit of the
type used to-day made its appearance
early in the Christian era. As their work
gives evidence, what medieval craftsmen
didn’t know about cabinet-making and
architectural joinery wasn’t worth know-
ing. And, there is no evidence that the
tools they used were one whit less effi-
cient in skilled hands than the machine-
made products of to-day. It isn’t too
much to say that a lad who served his
apprenticeship with Noah could pick up
in a week all the world has learned since
about wood handicraft.

THE PLEASANTEST COUNTRY.
Are fifty years of Europe still better than
a cycle of Cathay? To millions of Euro-
peans and thousands of Australian ex-
patriates Australia is Cathay—only less
civilised. They smile when you try to
explain how much Europe has changed
for the worse as a place to live in; how
much Australia has changed for the
better. If you go so far as to say that,
take it for all in all, an Australian city is
more comfortable than any European
city, there are shouts of derision. Yet it
is so.
It is not so much a question of climate.
Perhaps Lisbon, Palermo and Athens
have better all-the-year-round climates
than Melbourne or Adelaide, and any
town on the French or Italian Riviera is
pleasanter in the summer than Sydney,
not to mention Brisbane. Australian
cities owe many of their advantages to
the inhabitants and to the producers up-
country. Take food. Most Australians
don’t realise how amazingly good Aus-
tralian butter, milk, cheese and cream are
till they go to a middle-class English or
French hotel or restaurant. The butter
at any decent city restaurant in Australia
resembles the Normandy butter which
is only to be found in Paris restaurants
that cater for the very rich. The same
with bread. Did any Digger prefer over-
seas bread, army or civilian, to the bread
he came back to? Or the mutton chops?
Australian fruit and fish, taking them
by and large, are the best in the world.
One would not compare Sydney table
grapes and peaches with those sold by
Solomon in Piccadilly (although West-
ralian and South Australian grapes and
peaches are unexcelled), nor a King-street
snapper with a Jermyn-street salmon ; but
the Australian average is better. Smell
a fish stall in the Soho Market, with its
piles of flaccid cod ; examine the kind of
fruit- or vegetable-shop which middle-
class Britons patronise, and you will begin
to think kindly of our merchants of fish
and vegetables and fruit.
Before the war it was possible to get
good wine, beer and whisky at absurdly
small prices in London, Paris and other
European cities. First-class Scotch whisky
was 3s. 6d. a bottle at the Army and
Navy Stores in Victoria-street. A carafe
of lager (about a quart) cost 50 centimes
(5d.) at the Cafe de la Paix. Now
the nations of Europe are march-
ing to sobriety on the stomachs (and
pockets) of their taxpayers. Cheap wine
cannot be had in London ; it is obtain-
able but undrinkable in Paris. English
draught beer, though still praised, is not
what it used to be, and the beers avail-
able to the masses on the Continent are
revolting. A Londoner who recently
visited Australia named a certain local
beer as the best he had ever tasted ; all
he objected to was the price—for which
our politicians are chiefly responsible.
And he had nothing but admiration for
our light wines, a verdict confirmed the
other day by the judges at a London
wine show. Many of these wines are now
as good and nearly as cheap as their
opposite numbers used to be in Paris 20
years ago. Four States produce delicious
hock, chablis and sauterne, and the mar-
vel is that the local demand for them is
so small.
In all household amenities —kelvinators,
electric cookers, hot-water services and
the like —middle-class Melbourne and
Sydney are far ahead of middle-class
London and Paris. Paris, outside what
may be called the American belt, is years
behind the times, sanitarily speaking, and
there are still plenty of barristers’ “sets”
in the Temple without bathrooms.
England and Scotland are the best
sporting countries in the world for the
rich, and the worst for the poor. Not
one Londoner in ten thousand ever gets
a chance to shoot, ride or fish, or even to
swim, except in baths or pools, some of
which, according to last summer’s reve-
lations, are hideously insanitary. Racing is
prohibitively expensive ; hence the suc-
cess of the dog-meetings, which are acces-
sible to city-dwellers. It is the same with
golf ; and the supply of tennis-courts and
cricket-fields for working-class youth is
tragically inadequate. Australians have
no special genius for games ; the country
produces so large a proportion of good
cricketers, footballers, tennis players,
swimmers and so on because it offers
all sections opportunities to practise sport.
Some European cities have famous pic-
ture-galleries and public monuments ; but
every traveller knows dozens of Lon-
doners who have never seen the Tower
and Parisians who have never been inside
the Louvre. Many European restaurants
are better than Australia’s best—though
not so much better, nowadays, as some
Australians and all Europeans think. But
how many Europeans, and how many
Australian travellers or expatriates, ever
dine at a London Ritz or a Brussels
Claridge-et-Astor?
London, Paris, New York and Berlin
used to be supreme, in their different
ways, as entertainment centres. They
monopolised the best actors and actresses.
Since then the talkies have arrived, and
Australians can see and hear the leading
stage artists of the day, British, American
and German, on the screen.
There is one direction in which Aus-
tralia, by reason of its remoteness, is
under a handicap as compared with
Europe; its cities have no intellectual
circles worth talking about. However,
999 Europeans out of every 1000 never so
much as see an intellectual, and the fact
doesn’t worry them ; and neither do most
of the Australians who settle in London,
Paris or Berlin. Such people gather a
circle of ex-Australians round them with
all possible expedition and proceed to
live in Mayfair or the neighborhood of
the Avenue Hoche, as the case may be,
much the same lives that they lived in
Toorak or Edgecliff.
Finally, and worst of all, even London
—for generations the world’s most good-
natured, go-as-you-please city, despite its
Sabbath —has become unfree. Everything
is restricted, from immigration to drink-
ing hours. In Paris you are liable to go
to gaol for being caught during a rafie
without your papers of identity, and in
modern Berlin, according to a recent
cable, a stranger is liable to be hit over
the head and dragged to prison for omit-
ting to salute the swastika. The cities of
Australia have become the safest, .freest
and most peaceable in the world. A
wonderful boon; Australians do not
realise how wonderful till they have lived
for a few months in a country where you
have to keep watching your step.
Nearly all the tourists who come here
from Britain and the British possessions
in Asia appreciate these advantages and
fall in love with the country. What they
do not appreciate is being the prey of
our taxgatherers. Those who remain
for a year or more suffer very unpleasant
shocks when the N.S.W. division of the
army serves them with a demand for 5
p.c. of their income for local unemployed •
relief, and a still worse one when the
Commonwealth division informs them
that £lOO of income in England is worth
£125 in Australia and that its tax has been
assessed accordingly. Do away with this
spoliation and many more would come
to Australia, and a great number would
stay.
WORKING BADLY.
The Premiers are to meet in Hobart next
month to discuss the Commonwealth
Constitution. That instrument of gov-
ernment has worked, after a fashion, for
33 years, chiefly owing to the instinct of
the people for self-government; but men
of all parties now agree, though their
reasons differ, that it is working badly.
Defects revealed in the early years of
the Federation, such as the lack of power
to make effective trade and commerce
laws, have not been remedied. Powers
with which it was thought the national
Parliament had been fully provided have
fallen into disuse or been whittled away
by State action, meekly suffered, and
High Court judgments. The Inter-State
Commission has gone and Inter-State
Freetrade is going. Laws are made for
the same businesses by Commonwealth
and State Parliaments, and awards hav-
ing the effect of laws by Commonwealth
and State industrial tribunals; the re-
sulting confusion has been described by
the Attorney-General at Canberra, with
a gesture of despair, as “insane.”
There are State and Commonwealth
Health departments, Navigation de-
partments and Taxation departments.
Because the blessed Constitution con-
tains no express prohibition—it is specific
on few points—the N.S.W. Taxation
department has since 1930 been claim-
ing a special 5 p.c. tax on income
from other States which has already
borne two local income taxes and two
Commonwealth income taxes. This
form of robbery would not have been
possible in the colonial days. National
and provincial authorities clash (or have
clashed) almost everywhere, except in the
Post Office. Under Section 86 “the col-
lection and control of duties of customs
and excise” was made wholly a Common-
wealth matter; nevertheless, one State
tried to impose an excise tax, and another
has levied import duties in the form of
excessive harbor dues.
Imitating the Americans, the makers
of our Constitution—the people, of
course, acquiescing— set up a Court to
decide what might and might not be done
under it. This experiment is still on its
trial. It seemed to have been justified
when the High Court ruled that the
Commonwealth could attach the revenues
of a State Government violating its con-
stitutional obligation to pay interest on
debts taken over; but it was a majority
judgment, and the minority may become
a majority some day. The history of the
Court shows that it is apt to change its
mind with its composition.
On another important point our Con-
stitution-makers did not copy the Ameri-
cans. They imposed barriers of verbiage
against the admission of new States. This
is, of course, not the only reason why
new States have not been formed, but it
has impeded and—unless the barriers are
swept away—will continue to impede
their formation. In 1889, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Washington and Montana
were admitted to the Union; in 1890,
Idaho and Wyoming; in 1896, Utah;
in 1907, Oklahoma; in 1912, Arizona
and New Mexico. In 33 years of Federa-
tion not one State has been added to the
original six. Yet N. S. Wales (2,606,800
people), Victoria (1,822,200) and Queens-
land (949,100) contain upwards of five-
sixths of the population. These three
States send 58 members to the House of
Representatives, which (excluding the
voteless gentleman from the Northern
Territory) has 75 now and will have 74 in
the next Parliament; the three correspond-
ing American States, New York, Penn-
sylvania and New Jersey, have 91 Repre-
sentatives out of 435.
South Australia, Westralia and Tas-
mania protest that their interests have
been sacrificed to those of the other three
States, and that the political power of
Sydney and Melbourne is overwhelming.
They are all receiving grants-in-aid, and
the total has increased from £910,000 in
1929-30 to £2,130,000 this year ; but all
insist that the amounts are insufficient.
South Australia wants £2,000,000 instead
of £1,150,000 ; Westralia, £1,500,000 in-
stead of £600,000 ; Tasmania, £1,099,000
instead of £380,000. Westralia, for its
part, says it will leave the Common-
wealth unless its grievances are removed ;
and, although its Government is ob-
viously reluctant to force the issue, the
tremendous vote for secession cannot be
ignored.
Finance will bulk large in the Hobart
discussions. All the State Governments
are dissatisfied with a distribution of
functions which enables the Common-
wealth to show a surplus of millions,
with heaps of income-tax money still to
come in (many taxpayers did not receive
their assessments till the financial year
had closed), while they are struggling
with deficits totalling eight millions.
Obviously the Commonwealth will have
to relieve the States of some of their
burdens. If it were arranged to give it
full legislative control of Industry,
Health and Navigation—or of Health
and Navigation only if the politicians
won’t part with the “two shops”—it
would be a step towards remedying
chronic evils and simplifying a muddled
scheme of government which will have
to be mended if it is not to be ended.
UTOPIAS, PLAIN AND
COLORED.
In course of a leisurely pilgrimage in a
car, I spent a night or two in a country
town where the local cinema showman
had revived “White Shadows in the South
Seas.” Old stuff; but the way of the
country showman is often hard. And old
stuff can be got cheap.
I had not seen the thing before, but
a handbill assured me that as a represen-
tation of the contact between the white
man and the black it was as utterly re-
vealing and blindingly truthful as “White
Cargo.” The theme of “White Cargo is
that the climate of the tropics destroys
the white man morally and physically.
The theme of “White Shadows is that,
before the Caucasian came, the brown
man, especially the brown man in the
Pacific, lived a life of idyllic happiness.
The film started out with such bold
appeals to the emotions as that the
coral atolls of the South Seas had been
for centuries the last remnants of an
earthly Paradise.” Followed pictures ot
a jovial, carefree people spending their
time decking themselves with flowers and
making love innocent of any biological
significance. “But,” the author of the
subtitles went on, “the white man in his
greedy trek across the planet threw his
shadow over this lovely Eden.”
Then came views of an island after the
arrival of this destroying angel. The
whites all had underhung jaws and un-
shaven faces. All the native women
appeared to be their mistresses. All the
native men had the oppressed looks of
Occidental wage-plugs, complicated with
such diseases as elephantiasis.
This is a sentimental age, and the
trashier the sentiment the more likely it
is to be applauded. I have only a pass-
ing acquaintance with the particular
locality dealt with in the story ; but in
a near-by archipelago, where native cul-
ture reached approximately the same
level, girls used to be kept in pitch-dark
pandanus-palm cages, in which they
could neither stand up nor lie down, for
six or seven years until the arrival of
puberty. The notion was that during
this time they discharged a fatal elec-
tricity which struck dead all whom it
encountered. One white man described
the release of one of these daughters of
Eden. Her complexion was pale and
waxlike owing to the effects of her in-
carceration, she could scarcely walk and
her physique was permanently stunted.
In another island it was the custom to
destroy all children, the human livestock
being kept up by purchase from neigh-
boring districts.
In Polynesia generally, two-thirds of
the children were regularly murdered.
If these measures failed to solve the
population problem enunciated by the
Rev. Mr. Malthus, the old women and
infants were loaded into boats which were
taken out to sea and overturned. Going
farther north, the tribes of Borneo, before
the advent of the white man, lived in a
constant state of military preparedness.
Far from living close to Nature, they
dwelt in longhouses which were slums to
which the slums of Footscray are model
areas. The longhouses were for mutual
protection.
I once noticed in a Murut longhouse
a woman suffering from a loathsome skin
disease, known as korap, deliberately rub-
bing her infected hands over a clean-
skin infant. She had no explanation to
offer as to why she did it, except that it
was unlucky for any Murut not to have
korap. Korap is so maddeningly irri-
tating that the sufferer spends most of
the night sitting up scratching himself.
The custom dated from the time when
the price of survival in the Garden of
Eden was eternal vigilance.
Before the white man came in force to
Borneo everybody head-hunted. The
self-respecting Dyak maiden refused to
accept the overtures of her lover unless
he brought 12 heads as an engagement-
ring. Anybody’s head would do —even
that of a passing Chinese commercial
traveller. To this day in the British
settlement of Labuan can be seen huge
concrete domes built over the white
graves in the European cemetery. This
was to prevent the romantic Dyak beau
digging up the bodies to make up his
quota.
Until the Dutch intruded into para-
disiacal Bali, widows were habitually
burnt along with the corpses of their
husbands. I once landed at a Bali
village when a rajah’s funeral pyre was
in process of erection. I was told that
his widows were in hiding, not to evade
the horrors of cremation, but to avoid
being rescued by the Dutch authorities.
On another occasion I was present at
the sanctification of a chief’s house in
the Celebes. A live cock was buried
under each leg of the building in order to
strengthen the foundations. Before the
white man interfered in this Utopian
island, human beings took the place of
the poultry.
I hold no brief for white civilisation
in all its aspects. It has destroyed much
that was picturesque, substituting for it
much that is unpardonably ugly. A
Venus de Polynesia in a Matilda would
do as a symbol for this phase of the
subject. But the obverse of the medal,
that the brown man before the advent
of the white lived a life of romantic
beauty, is oily rubbish. It is also per-
nicious.
FENG-SHUL


PLAIN ENGLISH.
This “Film War.”
“S. M. Herald” announces that “the
film war is on.” One of the parties
concerned is a U.S.A. corporation, which
intends to' build more cinema theatres in
Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, which
already have enough of the garish things
to fill a Caliph’s paradise. Another is
General Theatres, which owns some of
the non-productive edifices ; it has notified
its intention of building a few more.
The Yankee concern says it intends to
erect only one theatre in every capital
to “provide an outlet for its product.”
It declares that the move has been forced
on it because its rival is “aiming at a
corner in all film-buying with a view to
obtaining a virtual dictatorship of the
industry.”
If the combine did obtain such a corner it
would not be in the interests of the companies
distributing films, whether British, Australian
or American.
A fat lot any of them cares for any
interest except their own! In 1929, when
the country was on the verge of a great
depression, and every business man of
vision was consumed with anxiety, these
moving-picture people united to throw
overboard what was at least a stable
Ministry because of the imminence of a
picture tax which would scarcely have
taken a spoonful of cream out of their full
cup. They supported “Independents,”
since consigned to oblivion, and Scullin
Labor, and used every publicity facility
which they owned to ensure the defeat of
the Brace-Page Government.
Since then they have been definitely in
politics. Their “industry,” as they call
it, lobbies hard against any tariff which
does npt meet with its august approval.
And it stills unloads on Australia miles
of junk in which the heroes are Bowery
gangsters, whose bumpings off are pre-
sented as acts of righteousness; the
heroines, ladies whose entrance should
always be heralded with a warning red or
blue light. Now and then it is delivered
of a so-called Australian film. Its latest
effort in this line is “The Hayseeds,” an
idiotic caricature of country people—
perhaps the silliest picture ever made.
A Government with a massive deficit
and 90,000 unemployed has more im-
portant work to do than to meddle in the
vulgar quarrels of merchants of blurb
and guff. Yet the Stevens Ministry is
employing a Sydney accountant—the
inevitable accountant! —to “investigate”
their latest shindy, with a Minister’s secre-
tary to help him. It is explained that
“there is no need for Mr. Marks to be
appointed a Royal Commissioner —only
recently a Royal Commission submitted
a comprehensive report on the ‘industry.’ ”
There is no need for any appointment.
If it is not cancelled, the Government will
be spending the people’s money in minis-
tering to the absurd self-importance of
blatant and uninteresting showmen. Let
it get on with its job.

A Little “Dessert.”
“El V.”: If the Empire Christmas broad-
casts could maintain the simple dignity
of the King’s speech they would serve a
useful purpose. The King’s language
and the King’s diction are a model for
every youngster. His speaking has
clarity, poise and resonance, and is with-
out a trace of affectation. But the mes-
sage sent from Australia was everything
it should not have been. Even “S. M.
Herald,” which has become hardened in
its 102 years of existence to grocers’-
label platitudes, was shocked into error
and confusion when it came to print the
atrocity, and referred to “green dailying
belts ’ and “desserts.”
Six and a half million Australians scattered
throughout a continent gladly proclaim loyal
greetings to this imperial Christmas festival.
That s a good beginning. No ignorant
Asiatic can believe after reading it that
Sydney has absorbed the whole of the
Australian population during the year
Neither can it fail to see the brand of a
Hollywood education upon us. Shak-
speare may write
My lord the Mayor of London comes to
greet you.
But this isn’t flowery enough for the
gentleman who spoke for Australia. He
makes us ‘ gladly proclaim loyal greet-
ings.
And now for the trade catalogue with-
out which no Australian message is com-
plete : —•
field* plantations, in golden wheat-
s > ™ cattle- and sheep-dotted plains and
tablelands, m green dailying belts in orange
groves and apple orchards, in heavily timbered
mountains and mine-riddled grante reefs In
desserts, in towns and busy cities made up of
factories, in hospitals, halls, law courts, theatres
shops, broad streets, homes, harbors snorts’
Sd Un from nd ,.T eIIOW bea . ches in all these places
and from all occupations, young sun-tanned
Australia to-day has rested!
This makes it clear that our cities are
not composed of mud huts and bough
sheds, and that we do not labor 365 days
in the year. “Young sun-tanned Aus-
tralia” has rested “in all these places.”
You see us lying around übiquitously in
the deserts which politicians tell us don't
exist, and at the same time spread out
on operating-tables, reclining on the
Bench, sitting back with our feet on the
knitting machine, splayed about the broad
streets, floating at ease in the harbors,
prone in the cricket fields, supine in the
homes. Less-civilised parts of the world
will learn with interest that no
Australian lies “on” a tableland or a
mountain or a plain. To avoid sunstroke,
he crawls into it, and when he wants to
get into a mine he picks the most select
and unusual and least populated kind in
the country, a granite-reef one.
In doing so, our people have contemplated,
not without satisfaction, the grim labors of
the year that is ending, taking fresh inspiration
from an event which, over 1900 years ago,
threw round the civilised world the strongest
bond yet forged, and turning to face the future
with carefree determination.
Apart from its classic beauty, this passage
is a nice tribute to our hardihood. We
contemplate with satisfaction, not the
ending of grim labors, but the grim
labors themselves. The part about
facing the future with carefree determina-
tion seems superfluous. Any national in-
stitution with the nerve to issue that effort
on behalf of the Commonwealth would
look forward with confidence even to
the eternity in Hades which it deserves.
The one good feature of the message
was its immediate destination, Bombay,
where a few thousand babus who have
“failed matriculation” must have hailed
it as a masterpiece.
♦
Patrolling the Border.
When is the Commonwealth Govern-
ment going to realise the danger of the
present unpoliced condition of the north-
ern fringes? There is a garrison of 30
men idle at Darwin. Police potter round
Groote Eylandt protecting missionaries
who don’t want to be protected. Other
police haunt the streets of Sydney in
droves, drafting the population on the
pavements as stockmen draft sheep, and
prosecuting motorists for leaving their
cars beside concrete pavements for which
the culprits have themselves paid through
the nose.
Meanwhile, in Arnhem Land, natives
scupper Japanese, and every few weeks
reports come in from the Aru Sea and
from the Mandated Territory about long,
lean, speedy pirate sampans which raid
the reefs for shell and trochus, and make
the lives of local traders a burden.
The last comes from the small flat
group of islands which form the most
northerly part of the Mandated Terri-
tory, the Ninigos. There raiders appeared,
36 strong, a few weeks ago and began
intensive diving. They left only when
the occupier of Awinn fired on them,
but before they went they burnt his copra
shed.
The authorities have known for years
that this sort of thing is going on. Mr.
Marr, the mild person who acts as
Minister for the Territories, and who
aspires to be an Administrator, said that,
“if the facts are as stated, I will submit
the matter to Cabinet,” and
The Government will no doubt make repre-
sentations to the Japanese Government.
There could be no more stupid and dan-
gerous procedure than to make an inter-
national incident out of a crime com-
mitted on its own territories. If somebody
steps off a foreign ship in Sydney Harbor
and burgles a house at Rose Bay, local
authority doesn’t make representations
to the Government of the country to
which the burglar belongs. It catches
the miscreant by the back of the neck
and sticks him in Long Bay to think
things over. Exactly the same course
should be taken with lawbreakers of
the trochus-beds. When a delegation
from Sydney going to a Communist con-
ference in China stepped off a British
ship into Japan, intending, as was sup-
posed, to preach Communism there, the
Japanese Government did not waste time
consulting Major Marr. It deported the
delegation.
The unpoliced condition of the out-
lands of Australia, combined with the
tendency of the Australian Government
to make every northern crime by an
Oriental an international incident, may
lead us into serious trouble. Somebody
will get illegally shot in process of steal-
ing trochus or gold-lip round a lonely
island. Then, perhaps, the foreign
country whose national he is will seize
on our precedent with avidity, and hold
the Australian nation responsible; and
there will be the deuce to pay.
The sooner a few motor-patrol boats
are sent to those waters the better. In
them might go some of those idle young
bluejackets who hang round newspaper
offices complaining about their officers
and their discipline.

Maoriland’s Banking Experiment.
The policy of Maoriland’s new Reserve
Bank, which, if it is to function as in-
tended, will “control monetary circula-
tion and credit,” will be worth watching
in relation to credits for imports. The
policy of the private banks during the
depression has been to restrict such
credits, with the result that surplus funds
are accumulating in London to the extent,
as the latest Budget discloses, of over
£13,000,000 in half a year.
On such balances the Government is
pledged to pay an indemnity at the rate
of the exchange disparity, 25 p.c., to the
private banks and, save in regard to the
sum represented by its own requirements
for interest, is carrying the liability for-
ward to a suspense account. It is very
much to the Government’s interest that
this liability should be reduced (both as
a matter of finance and because heavy
cost will endanger the popularity of the
boosted exchange). The most obvious
way to reduce it is to expand import
credits, and, as the previous experience of
the trading banks has shown, that sort of
policy has a way of getting out of hand
and landing the country into a devil of
a mess.
The new bank is to be controlled at
the outset by five Government nominees
and two officers elected by those
nominees. The directorate will have a
difficult course to steer.

Hogan v. the A.L.P.
Ex-Premier Hogan writes:
The paragraph in B. 13/12/’33 re the deci-
sion of the Court on my action against the
central executive of the Vic. A.L.P. incorrectly
interprets the Judge’s decision. I attach a news-
paper report of the judgment, which was, in
effect:
(1) That I had been refused endorsement
contrary to the rules of the party, and
(2) That I had been excluded from the party
contrary to the rules, and that my contractual
rights under the rules had been twice infringed.
In other words, the decision was that I was
unlawfully refused endorsement and unlaw-
fully excluded in violation of the rules of the
party. That was what I always contended.
The comment in your par. “that the case is
mostly interesting because it involved the plea
that a politician who is cast out of the party
fold has his livelihood interfered with” is
incorrect. That plea was not made. My coun-
sel showed that I had suffered damage by being
deprived of my chance to be elected Leader of
the Opposition, which carried a salary of £2OO
per year. That contention was a legal require-
ment in the case.

Effects of Inflation.
“The American Government is talking of de-
valuating the currency by 50 per cent. It is
expected that this will bring the Treasury an
immediate profit of £600,000,000 at par.”
Currency-devaluation has always been
popular with large sections during
slumps. It was advocated in Germany
after the war as a means of avoiding
reparations payments. Yet when it came
in earnest at the beginning of 1922 Ger-
mans of all classes were the worst suf-
ferers, the middle-class above all. Inside
nine months those whose savings were
in banks, stocks and the like were ruined,
and millions had got back to barter.
The French tried it a few years later —•
or rather, like the Germans, they let
themselves be driven to it by circum-
stances which they hadn’t the courage to
fight against. They escaped the worst
sufferings of their neighbors only
because they happened to have a states-
man capable of grappling with the situa-
tion.
When Poincare became Prime Minister
in the middle of 1926 the franc
had fallen to about a tenth of its
nominal value ; and it was going back,
as nearly always happens in such cases.
All the features of the German crash
were present: the desperate people on
salaries or wages or with cash in banks
or elsewhere who found their money
losing its purchasing-power day by day;
the shopkeepers who had to keep putting
up prices; the foreign gamblers who
snapped up francs in the hope that they
would have gone further back when the
time came to pay for them.
Poincare got the country out of its
crisis by heroic taxation and retrench-
ment. But there was one calamity he
couldn’t avert, and France is suffering
from it to this day—loss of confidence.
According to a recent cable
The Budget rapporteur (M. Marcel Regnier)
discloses the startling fact that £240,000,000 in
gold and notes is now hoarded in France, owing
to lack of confidence. The release of that
money would make a vital difference to the
country’s position.
India is the classic example of the
national results of wealth-hoarding. Its
princes and other rich men have been
putting their money into jewels for
generations, while the poor have starved
for lack of work. A fair amount of
hoarding went on in Australia during the
war. There will be a great deal more if
bad politicians get control of bank funds
and what they call “credit.”
♦ ;
From Newcastle-on-Tyne.
Australians would have liked to see an
Australian appointed to succeed Arundel
Orchard as director of the Sydney Con-
servatorium of Music. Only the fact
of being near the retiring age prevented
the nomination of Alfred Hill. The prize
has been offered to Edgar Bainton, of
Newcastle-on-Tyne.
The new man belongs to a county
whose connection with this country is
historic. The first great nobleman in
England to take a real interest in Aus-
tralia was the Duke of Northumberland,
and Alnwick Castle owns many manu-
scripts which testify to it. Our own
city of Newcastle is a real sister-town to
the old place both in industry and in
surroundings. Northumbria gave us
most of the names which are dotted
round about it on the map; Morpeth*
Hebburn, Hexham, Rothbury, Wallsend ;
gave us also many of the miners who
populate them ; and much of our mining
technique was born inland from Shields.
If it is thought that Newcastle is not
exactly a musical centre, let the delusion
be hurled in the teeth of those who hold
it. Much more than “On Ilkley Moor”
has come out of the North Countree.
Northumbria has provided many a re-
cruit for bands of Australian mining
towns, and if the voice of Shields and
Hexham has a rich and throaty quality
lacking in those centres of culture where
everybody wears long, hair and spells
his name in consonants, its choirs are
magnificent and it has done a great deal
to preserve English traditional music.
Bainton is himself a noted musician
and -composer. He is principal of the
Newcastle Conservatoire and has been
conductor of the city’s Philharmonic
Orchestra for 22 years. He is 53 years
old, a Coventry man; he won the open
scholarship for piano-playing and the
Wilson scholarship for composition, be-
came professor of pianoforte and com-
position at the Conservatoire in 1901,
spent the war in Ruhleben and an in-
ternment camp in Holland. He has con-
ducted at many famous English festivals
of recent years, and his compositions,
some of which have been published by
the Carnegie Trust, range from orches-
tral pieces and choir pieces to typically
English part songs. It is suggested that
he may not accept the appointment. If
he does not, the Government should not
bother to send overseas for a man.
» ;
“Settled.”
A Westralian doctor has issued a har-
rowing report on group-settlement con-
ditions. He declares that children born
in these places are underfed and under-
clothed and settlers themselves unable to
seek medical attention. His remarks
apply to Diggers and Imperial soldiers
alike.
It may be argued, of course, that
several generations of Australians were
bred under similar conditions and that
from them have descended fine and
sturdy men and women. The pioneers
indeed tasted no beef for years after
Sydney was founded. In the first decade
of settlement guests at Government
House parties brought their own bread.
Some of the ablest men on the continent
to-day were born without doctor or mid-
wife and fed on corned beef, pigweed and
damper in their earliest years.
But this is a different case. Young
men whom ambition or love of adven-
ture drove to Australia cannot be com-
pared with war-racked, often shell-
shocked and wound-marked, soldiers who
tackled the land. Nearly all Westralian
group-settlers and most of the soldier-
settlers in other States were complete
novices in agriculture or pastoral matters.
They trusted the Government to find
havens for them. The results in thou-
sands of cases have been disastrous.
A nurse with experience of the sand-
hills of far-western N. S. Wales recently
visited a soldier-settlement not so many
miles from Canberra. She was shocked
at what she saw there: educated women
with scarcely a dress to their backs
struggling on orchards where heartbroken
husbands grow fruit which nobody
wants; children half-fed and in worse
condition than the much-pitied children
of the far west, where sandy blight and
fly bite make summer a misery.
The responsibilities of Governments to
the soldier-settlers did not end when they
put them on the land nor even when
they took a bit off the mortgage or the
interest. More will have to be done for
those whose plight is desperate and unde-
served.

“AND IT'S PRINTED WI TH WINBLE'S INKS”
“Ming”: During my school-teaching
career I have kept a lookout for howlers,
but have met surprisingly few. Last year
was more fruitful; in an exam,
paper I encountered: ( a ) “A drome-
dary is a worker in precious stones,”
and ( b ) “Julius Caesar was given his
second name because he seized every-
thing he could lay his hands on.” After
these “Billy Hughes was a well-known
pirate of the South Seas” seems mild.

“Monty Peet”: Houseowning has its
unexpectednesses these days, quite apart
from paying bad tenants a bonus to get
out. A Sydney suburbanite who had
foreclosed on a mortgage was disa-
greeably surprised when the local
council presented him with a bill for
back rates (and interest thereon) ex-
“Mummy, how old is Aunt Emily ?
“I’m not sure, dear. I’d have to look up the family Bible.
“Gosh. Didn’t know she was old enough to be mentioned in the Bible.
ceeding £24, and covering a period of
34 years. When the mortgagee indig-
nan tly inquired why the mortgagor had
not been pressed to pay, he was frankly
informed that the council had been cheer-
fully waiting for the foreclosure as it
was its only chance of getting the
money. Worse still was the experience
of a woman who put down £5O, paid 255.
a week in instalments for over a year
and was regarding herself as an all-but
householder when the local council left
a demand note on her for £9O-odd, back
rates. Not having more than about 90d.,
she hastily anathematised the council and
everybody else concerned, and walked
straight out before the roof should fall
on her. In a few weeks the blessed
place itself walked.

A venerable Maoriland legislator’s con-
cluding remark on the Marriage Amend-
ment Bill:
I enter my protest against the bill. K at
some time in the future a child, through this
measure, receives the brand of illegitimacy, i
shall be able to say that I, for one, was not
to blame.
* * *
“Lao-dah”: The latest form of cen-
sorship comes from Mordialloc (Vic.),
where the council has banned the public
exhibition of sharks. Showmen have
been in the habit of buying monsters
captured by fishermen and making good
money for themselves and a bad advt.
for Mordialloc. The council complains
that the spectacle of a dead 14ft. man-
eater frightens away bathers, who visual-
ise similar brutes lurking around the
foreshore, whereas the exhibited speci-
mens are invariably caught miles away
outside the heads.

“A. Major”: English tenor Steuar».
Wilson, who came to Australia to sing to
radio audiences, was struck by the scarcity
of musical literature. He complains to the
“S.M.H.” that there is no library “where
one can obtain with certainty scores and
parts of the standard works even; cer-
tainly not any recent work.” The accu-
sation is well-founded, and it is time
something was done about it. Every year
sees some music-publishing house in Eng-
land, Germany or Italy going bankrupt.
Australian music-sellers found their busi-
ness had become unprofitable 20 years
ago, and started to sell gramophone
records ; later radio sets, and, still later,
flat-irons, refrigerators and electric-lamps.
It is still possible to buy from one or
two of them in Sydney the Beethoven
Sonatas or the Chopin Vaises, but be-
yond that is a vast hiatus, bounded on
the modern side by the masterpieces of
the Hollywood crooners.

“Caducus”: That row between the
Defence Department and the South
African veterans over the color presented
to the N.S.W. Army Medical Corps is
more serious than appears in “Linseed
Lancer’s” paragraph (B. 13/12/’33). In
his reply to the demand the return
of the flag George Pearce told the corn-
plainants: (1) That the inscribed plate
on the staff showed that it had been pre-
sented to the Australian Army Medical
Corps; (2) that the color had been lost
for years until found in 1929, and that
in consequence of the inscription it had
been handed to Commonwealth Army
H.Q.; (3) that it was the Commonwealth
which had sent an Army Medical contin-
gent to S.A. To which the South African
Association replies: (1) Whatever may be
the inscription now, the flag was pre-
sented to the N.S.W. corps before it
“Pipe the big fellow havin’ an eyeful. If you weren’t here he’d come over and
chip to me.”
“I think he’ll come anyhow. He’s the new inspector of insufficiently clad
surfers.”
got into Commonwealth clutches; (2) it
was not lost but housed for safe custody
in Victoria Barracks, Sydney, when the
Federal crowd annexed it; (3) N. S.
Wales sent three medical contingents
numbering 258, all ranks, to South Africa
before the Commonwealth contingent,
which was too late for active service, was
thought of.

“L.D.”: Vic. Police Commissioner
Blarney believes in the awe-inspiring
effect on citizens of a well-made figure
in a well-tailored suit. The other day he
held a parade of traffic cops and new
recruits, and a policeman was presented
ceremoniously with a brand-new suit of
clothes as a reward for being the best-
dressed man in that particular section of
the force. The Beau Brummel was Con-
stable P. J. Toner. It ought to have
been Tonier.

“X.S.”: Last year was the busiest year
for divorces in Victoria since 1928 ;
before the end of December 576 peti-
tions had been lodged, and more were on
the way. (The same is true of N. S.
Wales, but the number of Ma State peti-
tions was 1956.) One of the causes for
the anxiety of Victorians to be relieved
of their matrimonial responsibilities is
the Poor Persons’ Legal Assistance Act,
under which husband or wife can get
free advice and assistance provided
he or she has no property except
a suit of clothes. Previously such a
person had no alternative but to put up
with things as they were or separate with-
out recourse to law. Sociologists hastily
concluded that the poor were more moral
or more contented, but the above figures
tend to show that there is as much
marital infelicity in Collingwood as in
Kew.
* * * *
“Pawang”: What sort of person is
most suitable for running homes for
deserted, neglected or wayward infants?
The popular idea is that people who
“love children,” especially their own, are
best adapted for looking after other
people’s. This is a moot point. People
“love” children for all sorts of reasons.
Some enjoy the sensation of power which
control over youthful destinies gives
them ; some seek compensation because
they are not “loved” themselves, and one
of the commonest manifestations of this
emotion is exemplified by the women
who figure in the mother-love films.
They are usually sex-starved females
who are unhappy with their hus-
bands and tend to lavish their affections
on their offspring, regardless of whether
this is for the offspring’s good or not.
The best person to look after children
is one who is in the problems,
mainly psychological, that charse of help-
less juveniles involves, on the principle
that the man who is interested in porce-
lain handles it with care. There is an ex-
cellent analogy in the case of doctors
whose children fall ill. It is the usual
custom for them to call in another
medico, for they know that a strong sen-
timental bias in favor of the recovery of
a patient is a hindrance rather than a
help to the application of knowledge to
the case.
* * * *
“Ratama”: On Dec. 24 Sydney “Tele-
graph” filled up a chink in its columns
with a 30-year-old O. Henry story, “A
Chapparal Christmas Gift.” The yarn
tells how the Frio Kid shoots up a Christ-
mas wedding party because the bride has
preferred another man to himself, but
only manages to kill an innocent sheep-
man. There is an instant call for ven-
geance, the victim being a harmless per-
son who had done nothing to deserve
such a fate.
No one had heard him quote the line “Christ-
mas comes but once a year” to the guests.
It was surely an extraordinary as well
as a cruel coincidence that “S. M.
Herald” should have begun its Christmas
editorial on the very same day with the
worn-threadbare chunk of doggerel that
in the O. Henry story would have been
a reasonable excuse for murder.
* * * *
“Selma”: A story is being told of a
society leader whose husband is an
enthusiastic gardener. The lady gave
an afternoon party during the holidays,
the company being received by the
hostess and her daughters ; Dad was re-
ported to kindly inquirers as “having a
great time on the launch.” The gardens
were much admired, likewise the
view, which included an elderly gardener
with a long beard clipping a side hedge.
Then came afternoon-tea in the drawing-
rooms, during which a guest, feeling faint,
sought the coolness of a grove of palms.
While she was there she saw the gardener
remove his hat, coat and beard. As she
stared, fascinated, he turned and re-
vealed the features of the owner of
the place. After chuckling cheerfully
he explained that his wife refused to let
him garden while the party was on, so he
had rung up to say he was sending a
casual to cut the hedge. An ancient
Santa Claus beard and borrowed old
clothes did the rest, and he had put in a
satisfactory afternoon’s work while the
family were “wasting their time.”
THIRTY-FOUR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Farewell, old ’Thirty-three! The forward move-
ment
We fondly hoped from you was slow, it’s
true;
But, anyhow, you managed some improvement
Upon the dolorous days of ’Thirty-two.
I sort of felt you’d made our troubles lesser
Monday at midnight, when I oped the door
(And grabbed the milkjug hanging on the
dresser)
To let you out and welcome your successor.
Step in, young ’Thirty-four!
Punctual as all your forebears to the minute,
Unto our waiting world you wend your way,
Your wallet at your waist —though what is
in it
There’s none (except Old Moore, perhaps)
can say.
But were I asked to nominate the present
Of rarest quality and purest worth
You could bestow alike on peer and peasant.
I’d hazard, as the most supremely pleasant,
A bit more peace on earth.
Say, have you come to quell the noisy wrangles
Of nations snarling at each other’s heels?
To straighten out our monetary tangles?
To grease Trade’s miserably creaking wheels?
To rip Depression’s doubts and fears asunder?
Well, if you only make a start with this,
Millions of voices your acclaim shall thunder
And label you a veritable wonder,
Annus mirabilis.
Hopeful as ever anyhow we’ll greet you.
It’s "A votre sante !” as the bar we breast,
“Here’s how!” and “Cheerio!” and “Pleased
to meet you!”
So go your hardest, lad, and do your best.
The world is still enfeebled, sick and shaking,
Its tongue’s like worsted and its head is sore,
Its morale’s busted and its heart is breaking.
Hand out the pick-me-up for which it’s aching!
Come on, young ’Thirty-four!

T. THE R.


“6 x 2”: Amid the bustle and jollity of
the Christmas shopping in a Sydney
suburb I noticed a card bearing the
legend “Merry Christmas and Prosper-
ous New Year” hanging in the branch
office of an undertaking concern. One
couldn’t but wonder what would represent
a prosperous New Year for an under-
taker.
* * * *
“FY7”: There is still a bit of the
old pioneer push about your Queens-
lander. Just before Christmas an atten-
dant at one of the mental hospitals
hanged himself. Next day Home Secre-
tary Hanlon, entering his office, was
handed a written application for the job.
The note was brief and to the point. It
informed the Minister of the death of
his subordinate—the first news he had of
it —and went on to set forth the writer’s
qualifications for the vacancy, closing
with “apologies for crashing in, and a
merry Christmas.”

“Cauboy”: These visiting virtuosi
(Clara Butt, for example) who tell Mel-
bourne she is pre-eminently the musical
metropolis of the Commonwealth make
me tired. A city that flocks to hear a
well-advertised singer from overseas while
local talent remains half-starved can
hardly be described as musical. Not long
ago ’cellist Sisserman built up a brilliant
quartette. Since the only practicable
audience for chamber music is a
private one, seven concerts in some of
the noblest Toorakian chateaux were
arranged. There was no charge for
admission, as the concerts were on Sun-
day nights, but there was a collection
plate. Programmes included the best of
“Don’t kiss your husband when he comes home after working back ? Why ?”
“I always think he’s probably had enough.”
Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn and Bach,
and there was no question about the
quality of the playing—-it was voted ad-
mirable. The takings, including a large
number of threepenny bits, averaged five
pounds a night, and there was tea and
cake in some cases to fortify the music-
lovers for the ride home in their limou-
sines. And when a professional orches-
tra gave Sunday-night concerts at St.
Kilda a couple of years ago, the audi-
ences’ contributions were 90 p.c. in the
smallest silver coin issued from the Mint.

“Ex-M.0.”: As descendant of a long
line of bare-kneed cattle-thieves I object
strenuously to the proposed Australian
kilted regiments. The Highland regi-
ments still contain
a fair proportion of
genuine Highland-
ers ; the Australian
ones will not. The
Highland regiments
have long tradition
of service, which our
kilted regiments
would lack. The
A.I.F. tradition is
surely better worth
preserving than an
unreal fancy dress
which to us means
little or nothing.
There are even
graver material ob-
jections if kilts are
to be worn on active
service. The pleats
of a kilt are appall-
ing refuges for ver-
min. I saw some
dreadful cases of
frostbite among
kilted soldiers in
France ; as for gas,
I doubt if The Bul-
letin would publish
my official pictures
of what mustard
gas can do to a
Highlander. Much
of the warfare of
the future will be
mechanical. Would
any sane person
wear a kilt in a tank? It is rather strange
that at a time when the British army is
adopting service dress as simple and
practical as any in the world —except
perhaps the Japanese—Australia, whose
soldiers’ uniform, from hat to boots, was
the admiration of the Allies, is turning
to out-of-date impractical frills.
* * *
“Ibn el Issar”: The suggestion that the
turban is the most desirable of headgear
(B. 27/12/’33) is not convincing. I
readily concede that it hides a bald head
and need not be removed when a female
of the species enters a lift; on the other
hand it does lose shape unless con-
stantly retied. And which brand of
turban would “Hunter Tucker” - suggest
for Australian wear? The voluminous
Sikh or Jat, the tiny, cocked Mahratta,
or the dozen different varieties of Rajas-
than and other parts of India? Inciden-
tally, turban-tying is an art that few
Europeans can ever master. Not one in
a hundred of the British officers in
Indian regiments who wear the turban
as part of their uniform attempts to tie it
himself—at least he didn’t in pre-war days.
“Gemini”: The action of the Japan-
ese gentleman who has ordered his wife
to dispose at her discretion of one of
twins she recently bore him on the
ground that his family traditions were
against such double events will surprise
no one with some experience of the
Oriental. It is only in Western Europe
that twins are popular, and not always
there. As one goes east and from there
through Malaysia and the Pacific islands.
“You can’t park here.”
“I’ve got a fiat tyre. Ran over a bottle.”
“Couldn’t you see it and drive around it ?”
“No ; the fool had it in his hip pocket.”
the prejudice against them increases in
intensity. Some of the Island races slew
not only the children but the mother
responsible for them. Beneficent white
Governments stopped that in time, but
the old antipathy still lingers in spite of
official and missionary. Even to-day in
Papua the lady who has been too profuse
in her duty is referred to disparagingly
as “all same pig.”
» * * *
“Pat Bushie”: “Pank’s” par. (B.
20/12/’33) about the slipshod salutations
of politicians to Speakers and Presidents
set me thinking of the bowing and scrap-
ing of magistrates and attorneys in Syd-
ney police courts. Some of the legal
gentlemen enter the courtroom and
arrange themselves at the Bar table with
no more ceremony than a navvy slouching
into an eating-house. Others manage a
casual nod to the Bench ; a very few bend
almost double while standing behind the
Bar table. It is much the same with
the magistrates. Some walk on to the
Bench with a courtly bow toward the Bar
table; others give a perfunctory nod;
others just walk in and sit down without
any acknowledgment. And there are
some who almost rush the. solitary chair
upon the Bench as if they , were afraid
that some other person lurking about the
precincts of the court might beat them
to it.
* * * *
“Nikko”: A number of people mislay
lottery tickets and don’t bother any more
about them, but one M.L. woman, before
losing hers, memorised the number,
which contained three noughts at the
end. She read later that her number
had won second prize, a grand piano.
After hunting vainly for the ticket she
proposed going down and trying to col-
lect her prize, but was made by an un-
sympathetic family to realise that such
a proceeding would merely be waste of
time. Three months later, having read that
all unclaimed prizes were to be sold by
auction, she had the hard luck to watch
the piano she knew was really hers
knocked down for its shop price. The
ticket never turned up.
* * * *
“Cotter”: Although nearly half of
Canberra’s 8000 residents fled the city
over the Christmas holidays their place
was taken by a horde of tourists such as
the Federal capital had never seen before.
About five or six thousand of them came
to admire the maze of roads and rose-
bushes and the acres of polished parquet
for which they have helped to foot the
bill. And more than half were shown
round Parliament House by perspiring
attendants who have worked up a patter
round such relics as Queen Victoria’s pen
and Billy Hughes’s bust. The Govern-
ment is trying to popularise the place.
As part of the campaign, the Hotel
Canberra advertised a 15-course Christ-
mas dinner for 4s. 6d. No other
management would have supplied it for
twice the price, and with 250 guests
piled into the dining-room it must have
proved a costly piece of advertising. Also
there was a special motorists’ camp, com-
plete with sleeping quarters, virtually free
of charge, and some 400 motorists made
the most of it. Fairy godfather Perkins
has another project in hand for brighten-
ing up the city. He promises to put
a dam across the Molonglo, so that there
will be another four feet of water in the
river and civil servants, and others will
be able to float in punts beneath shady
willows.
* * * *
“Ex-Cavalryman”: I’ve met all sorts
of damned fools in the Regular Cavalry,
but never an officer who became con-
fused as to the right or left of a squad
(B. 27/12/’33). The thing is so self-
evident that it is not even stressed in the
various drill bibles (mostly written for
people of a low grade of intelligence).
In the ranks one did occasionally come
upon recruits who were in such a state of
nervous tension that they would turn left
when right was indicated, but the old
“hayfoot”-“strawfoot” soldier has been
dead a very long time.
* * * *
“Arrested Case”: The truth about
germ-infection from street-spitting (B.
29/11 ,/’33) is this. If the sputum lobs
on a pavement or roadway where the
sun has a clear go at it, the germs will
be destroyed by the baking they get. The
same applies to germ-infected garments,
washed or soaked in water and then
dried thoroughly in the sun’s rays;
they should be turned two or three times
to let the searching rays get in their
good work over every inch of them. But
if the spitting is done in a shady spot
the germs, when dry, will still be a poten-
tial source of danger when blown about,
until a wetting and a sun-drying render
them innocuous. Wet and cold also
destroy germs, if not so rapidly. Some
time ago there was an attempt to raise
a newspaper scare over the occasional
underground swampiness of the gravelly
soil of the cemetery near a well-known t.b.
sanatarium. Yet, unless cremation is em-
ployed, burial in such soil is quite the
best way to ensure the destruction of
the millions of white-plague microbes
that are interred with every victim of
the disease.
* '$ $ $
“Esters”: That idea of wine being re-
served in a baby’s first year to be drunk
on his 2lst birthday (B. 27 /12 / ’33) is a
purely English one, as far as the writer
has ever been able to find out. The
custom is as old as the hills —it is men-
tioned in the “Ingoldsby Legends”—and
the purpose was to make sure of the
right temperature and atmosphere to en-
sure the proper maturity of wines. I
very much doubt if the bricked-in cellar
which “Shep” and his mates chanced on
in war-time Flanders was designed for
any such purpose. None of the French
beverage wines would stand keeping for
21 years, and very few of the heavier
ones. The idea that age benefits a wine
is just a legend, except with regard to
ports, Madeiras and the like.
TWENTY YEARS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Life, how swift is your arrow’s flight!
It is twenty years by the tale of Time,
Twice ten years to this very night,
Since first, by virtue of one poor rhyme,
To me was the treasured term applied
(Ah, jaded heroes of stage and screen,
Are ye borne on the tide of such pristine
pride?)
Of “a bloke what writes for The Bulle-
TEEN ! ”
Twenty years! And the times have changed,
And much grows grey that was golden then.
(Oh, the lyric years and the loves estranged!
Oh, the lingering feet and the lagging pen!)
It’s little that’s easy, one finds to-day,
In a wolfish world that is hunger-keen,
Save to drift in the gay traditional way
Of “a bloke what writes for The Bulle-
teen.”
Dream by dream I have told my days,
Shadow by shadow and flame by flame.
And if there was little the world cared praise
There was not o’ermuch for the world to
blame.
I’ve sighed “Cui bono ? ” at times, no doubt,
But the gods send solace to all, I ween;
In the hardest drought there are coves who’ll
shout
For “a bloke what writes for The Bulle-
TEEN.”

POLITICAL POINTS
Last year the Prime Minister bespoke
Imperial decorations for his messenger
and his chauffeur. This time he has had
them issued to his private secretary and
his typist, as well as three veterans of the
Parliament House staff. Next year, per-
haps, he will attend to the vacancy in
the kennel that Bruce built and get an
0.8. E. for his dog.
Victoria’s Parliament is challenging the
Canberra Legislature’s record for passing
ill-considered legislation in quantity. Dur-
ing the late session it churned out 103
bills, most of them in the last two or
three weeks. The most important mea-
sure was Transport Regulation. It came
back from the Leg. Council in a mangled
form; still Menzies, the author, is
moderately happy.
In spite of the Queensland Premier’s
efforts to persuade his flock that the new
Brisbane bridge will pay for itself in the
briefest of periods after completion, the
air is thick with raspberries. A taxpayer
suggests an inscription for a plaque on
the first king pillar: “This bridge is
dedicated to posterity, which will com-
plete cost of construction.”
Defeat by a 6-to-l majority attended
A. S. Henry’s effort to modernise the
N.S.W. divorce law by introducing the
lunacy and separation clauses of the
Maoriland Act. Yet the Menzies bill
liberalising the lunacy section of the Vic.
measure and making drug-addiction a
ground for divorce had a smooth pas-
sage through both Houses. Obviously
Vic. legislators, unlike the crowd in Mac-
quarie-street, Sydney, do not go in craven
fear of the Church vote.
Anxious to conciliate capitalist Britain,
and to satisfy urgent needs, the Soviet
has sold a fourth-century manuscript
of the Bible to the British nation. It
asked £500,000 at first, then came down
to £200,000, and finally to £lOO.OOO.
which is to be paid in goods. Even an
anti-God Government might be expected
to hang on to such a treasure, and ob-
viously its necessities are great.
The end-of-the-session rush in West-
ralia was marked by another quarrel
between the Assembly, in which Labor
predominates, and the Council, which is
mostly Nat. and C.P. In the result the
State has now no Financial Emergency
Act, which means that the Government
and private employers are faced with the
obligation of paying boom-time wages
and salaries. Much against its will, the
Government is summoning members to
meet again in a week or two, meantime
muttering dark threats as to what it will
do to the Council if it ever has the
chance.
“Bondy” Hoare has been rejected by
the northern (N.S.W.) coalminers, whose
president he has been for so many years.
During the Newcastle-Maitland strike he
was in the habit of talking to them for
two or three hours a day, and in the end,
apparently, he talked himself out of his
job. The gentleman announces that he
is going to take a much-needed “mental
and physical rest.” Why drag in mental?
The British telephone people have
found a way of checkmating the pest who
listens-in on party lines. Subscribers are
to be connected to the exchange in groups
of from four to eight, and will, it is
promised, be able to talk with complete
secrecy. It is confidently expected that
the innovation will be introduced by
Parkhill’s department in 1954.
With the New Year, Nazi Germany
has entered upon its task of sterilising the
unfit. The policy was condemned in
advance by the Pope, but a later com-
munication from the Vatican is couched
in milder language, and it is suggested
that a compromise is possible. It is to
be hoped so, anyhow, for the issue is
bound to arise in other countries, and the
sad old world doesn’t want to have
another series of quarrels between
Church and State added to its troubles.
Even the Australian taxpayer can feel
fortunate when he contemplates the
plight of his white brother in Java. In
that island of 45,000,000 browns and a
handful of Caucasians there are a State
tax, a provincial tax, a municipal tax, a
house and servants tax, a motor-car tax,
a capital tax and a crisis tax —40 p.c. on
the total of the other taxes. It comes so
total of all the other taxes. It comes so
short of the tax-collector’s expectations
that it is to be raised to 65 p.c.
A writer in the “Saturday Evening
Post” suggests that the Democratic

“France has rejected Germany’s proposal for direct disarmament negotiations, saying
that any arrangement must be made within the framework of the League.”
“I vould like to haf a chat mit you, mamselle. A nice leedle chat, und”

national-recovery measures, or some of
them, may be declared unconstitutional;
but that won’t necessarily be the end of
them:
Doctrines which have represented a minority
side of Supreme Court decisions can easily
become the majority, depending upon how the
Supreme Court personnel changes, and whether
new Judges are appointed who are in harmony
with the so-called liberal views in construing
the Constitution.
It is not only to the U.S.A. that such
remarks apply.
U.A.P. officialdom is delighted with the
New Year “honors” list. Every State has
been remembered, and every interest sus-
pected of being dissatisfied. Steps in rank
for “Bawra” Higgins and Admiral Hyde ;
K.Bs. for a Ma State pastoralist and
Victoria’s perpetual president of the
R.S.L.; C.M.Gs. for the Diggers’ secre-
tary and Brown, of the Post Office;
C.B.Es. for Oxlade, of the Board of
Cricket Control, and Mrs. Daisy Bates,
the abos.’ champion (this may wipe out
the memory of that “proposed puni-
tive expedition”); 0.8.E5. for the
Priminister’s private secretary, now back
in “S. M. Herald” office, and the president
of the N.S.W. Country Women’s Associa-
tion —why, if the U.A.P. secretaries had
drawn up the list they couldn’t have done
better.
After 40 years bookmakers are shout-
ing the odds once more on South Aus.
racecourses. Sixty fielded at Port
Adelaide ; of course, they reported a bad
day, and “the victory of Clodhopper took
£6OOO out of the Ring.” A “Liberal”
Ministry is responsible for their reintro-
duction. Had Governments made a more
intelligent use of the tote and been less
greedy in their demands on it McShort-
odds wouldn’t have wanted to return;
they could not expect that the absurd
1-2 method of distribution would ever
become popular. In Victoria the machine
is beating the man behind the bag, and
if the tax were halved, a “doubles” tote
were added and telegraphed wagers were
accepted, it would put the s.-p. variety
out of business as well.
Australian Labor leaders formed a high
opinion of Franklin Roosevelt when
they heard he was going in for a form of
industrial arbitration and a grandiose
public-works policy. They will think
more of him than ever now they know
he has a mammoth deficit and regards it
with a light heart:
President Roosevelt professed no concern
when a Treasury statement revealed that the
Federal deficit for the current fiscal year ex-
ceeded 1,000,000,000 dollars.
It is actually 1,024,000,000 dollars ; but
what’s twenty-four million dollars?
The latest attack on the Forgan Smith
citadel has been delivered from the
Retired Police Association. Moore’s
Financial Emergency Act took 15 per
cent, off police pensions ; Forgan was ex-
pected to restore the 15 per cent., and
some of his friends announced that he
would; he now says he cannot. The
malcontents point out that Forgan and
his friends could have repealed the Act.
Minister Marr has undertaken to look
into the prices charged by the Common-
wealth serum laboratories. It is only right
that the laboratories should pay their way,
but they should not be expected to show
substantial profits, as they have been
doing. The price of insulin, always in
demand, has recently been reduced,
greatly increased sales resulting. The
serum marketed as an antidote to the
poison of the tiger-snake costs £6 a dose,
which is out of the reach of even well-
to-do hospitals.
Australian Governments pay far too
much attention to moving-picture people.
Another “film war” having broken out,
Stevens has commissioned an accountant
to inquire into the rights and wrongs of
it. His Government has 10,000 better
uses for the little money it has. Simul-
taneously it has placed a courtroom at the
disposal of a concern engaged in making
an “Australian” film based on an English
shocker, “The Silence of Dean Mait-
land.” Another set of persons is per-
petrating one more Kelly-gang picture.
They deserve to be fined £lO,OOO lor ex-
ploiting the theme, but possibly the Gov-
ernment will give them the run of the
police wardrobe and armory.
Van der Lubbe, the Dutch Communist
who was caught in the act of setting fire
to the Reichstag building, has been found
guilty of high treason and sentenced to
death; three Bulgarians and a German,
who were also accused, were acquitted.
Alleging that Nazis had burnt the struc-
ture and that the proceedings were a fake,
some British pacifists, backed by a lot of
persons who ought to have known better,
conducted a mock trial in London which
gave the Germans a legitimate cause of
complaint. The judgment has made these
busybodies look idiotic.
S.A.’s Unemployment Relief Council is
wiser in its generation than the Govern-
ment which is financing all manner of
relief works, largely in overbuilt muni-
cipalities, in N. S. Wales. Its secretary,
F. K. Dwyer, told the Disabilities Com-
mission that, while loan works would
“substantially reduce present unemploy-
ment figures,” the cost would “ultimately
have a reactionary effect—tend to aggra-
vate the problem rather than cure it” ;
and so it would. Sustenance is costing
S.A. £9200 a week for 41,500 persons ;
relief work would, in Dwyer’s opinion,
cost at least three times as much.
Teece, general secretary of the coal-
miners, has lost his job as well as Hoare.
Orr, who ousted Teece, and Jack, the
conqueror of Hoare, belong to the mili-
tant section. They might have been
joined on the executive by one Scanlon,
who is redder than either ; but Scanlon’s
nomination for the vice-presidency was
ruled out on technical grounds.
From “Feng-Shui”:
The Dalai Lama is dead; long live the Dalai
Lama! Tibetans believe that the soul of the
deceased potentate is reincarnated in the body
of a child, who is identified by means of a
rainbow. A commission or board of lamas
traces the celestial phenomenon to its source,
which is usually in a cradle handy to the capi-
tal. The newborn infant is questioned as to
whether he believes in the established religion,
the existing financial systepi, the Tibetan pro-
tective tariff and the Brown Tibetan policy. If
his answers are satisfactory he is carried trium-
phantly in procession to Lhasa and installed
on the throne. The birth has to be registered
with the Chinese Government; there are up-
wards of 157 Grand Lamas and lesser lamas
registered in Peking. It is possible for a Dalai
Lama to be reborn in Mongolia; but if that
happened in this age he would be told to try
again and get reborn nearer Tibet, to obviate
political complications. Mongolia would be
liable to rally round the infant and start an
invasion of China with tanks, aeroplanes and
machine-guns obtained from the Soviet.

Gilbert Dyett, Federal president of the
R.S.L. since 1919, has been made a K.B.
An old Marist Bros.’ boy from Bendigo,
he enlisted in 1914, was wounded at Lone
Pine, returned home in 1916 and took
charge of recruiting in Victoria. A
racing-club secretary, he has had many
critics in the organisation, but even they
admit that he is amiable and able.
W. N. Whidburn broke a record at
the N.S.W. Railways and Tramways
Eisteddfod. In one day he judged 201
competitors in the elocutionary section.
He sat from nine in the morning till close
on midnight except for two short breaks
for meals, and he was not engaged in
merely listening —he wrote a criticism
on each competitor. Whidburn is used to
handling elocutionists in large numbers—
-800 at Geelong, over a thousand at South-
street, Ballarat, and 1675 at Adelaide last
year. A native of Ballarat, he took part
in the first South-street competition
in 1891, and won the Alfred Deakin
silver medal for oratory. Instead of
following in the footsteps of the
donor of the prize, he took to teaching
at Ballarat, and later at Geelong, where
his brass plate still stands.
Few pastoralists have been given titles
as such, and F. D. McMaster’s K.B. is
a tribute to his philanthropy rather
than to his thirty-odd years’ work
as a primary producer. He gave the
C.S.I.R. £20,000 to build the McMaster
Animal Health Laboratory at Sydney
University. Dalkeith, his station near
Cassilis, has been the show place for
quarter of a century of a district which
includes such celebrated squattages as
Brindley Park and the Clives’ old place,
Collaroy. The new knight is the young-
est son of the late Duncan McMaster, of
Binnia Downs ; he has always been a
generous supporter of sport (particularly
lawn tennis); he stood by N.S.W. Diggers
who were up against it during the war,
and he has stuck to them nobly since.
His depression gesture consisted of a
gift of 500 high-class rams to the State
Government for distribution among
hard-hit settlers.
A K.B. has also gone to Langer Owen,
of Sydney, a retired Supreme Court
Judge, whose father was a N. S. Wales
Supreme Court Judge and a knight
before him. He had a big Equity prac-
tice when the war began, and he was
over the military age. Yet he made
straight for Victoria Barracks and did
his best to go overseas in a combatant
unit. He was given a home-service job
in the end, and in 1915 he established a
Red Cross branch in which he worked,
with his daughter Gladys Owen, for the
duration. As a Judge he functioned
chiefly in divorce. He is still at the
height of his powers, and has given
general satisfaction as an unpaid Royal
Commissioner (on performing rights in
copyright work) and as an arbitrator in
respect of claims for compensation by
British immigrants in Victoria. He was
educated at Charterhouse and Oxford
and is a member of the English and N.
S. Wales Bars.
Maitland (S.A.) has induced its Mayor,
Baden Pattinson, to remain in the chair
for a third term so that the corporation’s
jubilee celebrations may be in his hands.
His career has been unusual. He matri-
culated for the Law Faculty of Adelaide
Uni. at 15 —a year too young to enter.
For three years he was clerk to Josiah
Symon, and at 19 he had qualified for the
Bar —two years too young to practise ;
so he became managing clerk to the then
Attorney-General, J. H. Vaughan, M.L.C.
At 21 he was in practice at Maitland, at
24 a J.P., at 25 a councillor, at 28 Mayor
and at 30 M.L*A. for his district as a
Liberal —his seat is one of the safest in
the State. He has drafted most of the
wheat and farm-relief legislation of the
past couple of years, is now Whip with
an almost automatic right to the next
Ministerial vacancy, has accompanied the
Premier to the Loan Council, holds the
senior partnership in the legal firm of
Pattinson, Symon and Carne, sits on a
dozen boards and is a likely tip for the
Premiership in the not distant future if
Federal politics do not tempt him.
N. S. Wales lost one of its best-
known pastoralists when Edward Killen
passed out. He owned Moonagee
and Gerar stations at Nyngan, Nymagee,
near Cobar, and Wee Jasper at Yass.
Along with his brother, the ex-M.P.,
Edward was joint governing director of
Elsinora Pastoral Co., and a director of
Dunlop Co., Ltd., and Marra Co., Ltd.
For 18 years he had been a member of
the Graziers’ council, and was a mem-
ber of the council of the Sheepbreeders’
Association and a member of the Stock-
owners’ Association. Two sons and
three daughters survive.
M. J. Canny, Vic. Railways’ new Com-
missioner in succession to T. B. Molomby,
set his feet on the ladder which led to
a seat alongside Clapp as a messenger in
1897. He has had several big jobs. When
transportation got into an appalling mess
in 1919 owing to the shortage of trucks,
Canny was put on to unravel the tangle.
Later Clapp sent him to U.S. to study
conditions there. His salary will be
£1750, less deductions under the Act.
Wilfred Kent Fethers, Royal Insur-
ance’s manager in Melbourne, is a
Caulfield Grammar boy who developed
a passion for soldiering in his youth and
had eight years of hard commissioned
training in the Victorian volunteers and
the militia before he went to the war as
major in the 24th Batt. He served on
the Peninsula till the Evacuation, was
in command of the 23rd at 31, and
from then onward spent most of the war-
time accumulating wounds. He was shell-
shocked at Armentieres in June, 1916,
severely wounded at Pozieres and sent
W. K. FETHERS, Digger and insurance
man.
back to Australia; then he commanded
the Persic battalions en route to Europe,
went to New York to help raise the first
Liberty Loan and took American and
Australian troops to Europe just before
the war ended. He looks more like a
regular army officer than an insurance
man. In his earlier days he was no slouch
on a cricket pitch.
Dead in Melbourne at 82 is H. M.
Strachan, who was reckoned to be Aus-
tralia’s oldest woolbroker. He was a Gee-
long native, and held the cords in the Mel -
bourne Grammar School’s boat in the
first race for the Head of the River title.
Later, he interested himself in sugar-
growing in Queensland and in banking,
but mostly in the wool-broking business
which his father, who built the first brick
building in Melbourne, had started at
Geelong. H.M. was interested also in
the early pastoral history of Victoria,
and in 1927 he published privately a book
of “Notes and Recollections,” dealing
largely with this subject.

which come after his name. He has
done a great deal to revive ballad music
and popular airs in England, and proudly
declares that he is definitely a “lowbrow.
He has a high opinion of Australian
bands—he heard the Commonwealth
Band at the national contest at the
Crystal Palace a little while ago, when
it took third place against the best Eng-
lish bands, and he says that the New-
castle Band which went to Wembley in
1924 was magnificent. The cap’n was
exactly the right man to put in charge of
the A.B.C.’s brass voices. Every bands-
man swears by him.
Herbert Phillipps has had an 86th
birthday in Adelaide. He has long
dropped out of George Wills and Co.
and the Employers’ Federation, but is
still chairman of directors of the State
Savings Bank, the Executor Trustee Co.
and a host of charitable bodies.
The veteran knight Langdon Bonython
has laid the foundation-stone of Adel-
aide University’s “Great Hall,” the cost of
which (£40,000) he is paying. It is to be
132 feet by 45 feet, and is to seat over 1000
people. After brisk argument as to the
site, it has been placed to face North-
terrace, near the original University
block. The Barr Smith library and other
recent buildings are down the hill on the
riverside frontage.
An old North-west hand is standing
for the W.A. Legislative Council next
year in G. F. Egan. He has lived almost
all his life in the outback, first on
stations in far-western N. S. Wales and
northern South Aus. He went to Car-
narvon (W.A.) 30 years ago, has con-
trolled the “Northern Times,” the local
newspaper, for 18 years and is now in
his fifth year as Mayor of the town.

Hugo Larsen, who is bringing Horace
Stevens, the great Australian vocalist to
sing to us in March, is a tall Dane who
started life as a telegraphist in the Great
Northern Co., which runs a line across
Siberia He came to Australia in 1916
and put his hand to all sorts of jobs, but
an interest in music turned him to the
virtuoso trade. Competition in that busi-
ness is terrific, but Larsen succeeded in
making Peter Dawson and Mark Ham-
bourg the biggest financial successes of
1931. The entrepreneur had to guarantee
£12,000 before he took a penny, but
Dawson was a horse to put anybody’s

Gone from the Sydney scene:
The uncanny manner in which “Blind
Freddy” (Frederick Solomon) could make his
way about Sydney and do everything he needed
as if he had the full use of his eyes made
him an identity of the city. Freddy, one ot
whose exploits was to drive a hansom cab the
length of Pitt-street, was a dapper little man
who had a prosperous run with cigarettes and
such other goods as can be carried in a kitbag.
He never forgot a voice; men he had not
encountered for over a decade tried him out,
and he recognised them immediately. If not
affluent, he made quite a tidy income, and was
so well known that he gave rise to a local
idiom known to everybody—“ Even Blind
Freddy could see that!” He was in the late
sixties when he died the other day.

INSULATION! . . . that’s the job of the Willard Patented
Threaded Rubber Insulator. It must separate each positive plate
of the battery from the negative. The better it does this, the
longer the battery lives! That’s why Willard uses rubber as
insulation!
This Patented Threaded Rubber Insulator has an insulating value
higher than any other used! Willard Insulators actually outlive
the plates! Thoroughly porous, they allow the electrolyte to
circulate freely at all times —which means that maximum battery
performance is obtained.*
A Willard Thread Rubber Battery will give you real economy—
longer battery life and no reinsulation expense! You’ll get easier
and quicker starts, under all conditions —and more of them!
Willard Threaded Rubber Insulator has established new ideas of
battery value—battery performance—and battery life! Ask your
dealer about the Willard Thread Rubber Battery!

*This Illustration Explains
the Porosity of the Willard
Thread Rubber Insulator.
Porosity simply means the ability of the separa-
tor, or insulator, to permit proper circulation of
the battery solution between the positive and
negative plates. The illustration above shows
clearly the tiny threads, or wicks, which carry
the acid through. There are 5,000 of these wicks
to the square inch in the Willard Threaded
Rubber Insulator. This means easier and quicker
starting for you under all conditions! Practically
85% of all battery ills can be attributed to the
premature failure of conventional insulators.

This is the big operating concern which
supplies Victoria with most of its
beer. The number of trade union-
ists registered as unemployed in the
State advanced from 10.9 p.c. in 1928
to the peak figure of 27.7 p.c. for the
second quarter of 1932. Over the same
period the annual brew of ale and stout
fell away by over 27 p.c.; also, there
was a heavy shrinkage in the value of
hotel properties, leases and rentals, as
well as stinging increases in taxation, in-
cluding excise, which was bumped up
from Is. 3d. to 2s. a gallon in 1929. The
contraction in C.U.B.’s declared net
earnings was nearly 50 p.c., and the div.
dropped from p.c. to 10 p.c.
The unemployment figure fell to 23
p.c. for the second quarter of 1933, and,
after providing for contingencies, the
year’s gross earnings from the trade
(£263,231) were £18,994 better. Rentals,
etc. (£56,854, after deducting compensa-
tion fees, etc.), slipped £10,724, despite
a net addition of £58,020 to the book
value of hotel freeholds. Exes. (£85,545)
were £2343 lighter, leaving the net figure
at 12.2 p.c. on capital as against 11.4,
12.3, 17, 21.6 and 22.8 p.c. back to 1928.
The div. was kept at 10 p.c.
With employment still on the increase,
spending less restricted than it was, real-
estate values steadier, a 40 p.c. cut
in the special tax on income from pro-
perty, and bits taken off land and other
taxes, prospects of further improvement in
earnings are encouraging, especially since
the co. continues to tighten its grip upon
the trade by buying up hotel properties.
How well ribbed the co. is financially,
and other things, are seen in the next
table:

The more or less liquid surplus
(£1,363,368, including stocks, down
£5777) was £13,110 less than at the pre-
vious balance, due to the outlay on hotel
freeholds. Debtors’ balances, etc., were
reduced by £122,576, while mortgages
were reduced by £117,679, and cash, etc.,
was strengthened by £27,699. On plant
£33,200 more was written off than was
spent. The book value of stocks is only
£17,713 in excess of the 1924 figure, and
the co. has meanwhile bought the Mel-
bourne Co-operative, Fitzgerald’s (Castle-
maine) and Cohn’s (Bendigo).
The public is interested in the C.U.B.
through the following half-dozen holding
cos.:
Holding Market Re-
Paid in Div. Price turn

Carlton ... £816,992 £631,704 8.0 43/6 3.6

Melbourne
Co-0p... 431,981 650,000 13.3 32/- 4.3
Excluding McCracken’s, whose scrip sel-
dom comes on to the market, the average
return from the other five at the prices
quoted is 4.3 p.c. as against a shade over
5 p.c. a year ago. The drop is due
mainly to the cheapening of money and
strong demand for industrials with pros-
pects.
Commonwealth Life (Amalgamated)
The Commonwealth Life and the Citi-
zens and Graziers’, launched in 1920 and
1921 respectively, decided that the best
way to arrest the drift was to get together
and make an assault upon outgoings. So
the present co. was formed and took over
the two businesses as going concerns from
Sept. 30, 1926, for £147,192 in scrip, in-
cluding £118,743 for goodwill. The C.
and G. continues to carry on the Queens-
land section of its business, owing to State
legislation. The agreement gave the
Amalgamated co., whose issued capital
is fully-paid, the right to call upon the
holding cos. for equal amounts of their
respective unpaid capitals (together now
£ 114,000-odd) in exchange for fully-paid
£1 shares.
At Sept. 30, 1931, the actuary figured
liabilities under policies in the Amalga-
mated co. at £288,978. To bring net
tangibles up to the mark, the holding
cos. were asked to take up a further
£60,660 of scrip between them. The C.
and G. has refused to make the necessary
call (Is. per share) on its shareholders,
and has also refused to hand over the net
proceeds of another Is. per share asked
for by the Amalgamated co, at the end
of 1930. The dispute was taken to the
N. S. Wales Equity Court, which decided
in favor of the Amalgamated co. But the
C. and G. (it says the capital it raised in
1931 was needed in connection with its
Queensland business) has appealed to the
High Court, and there the matter stands
for the present.
One unfortunate result of this squab-
bling is that prospects of bonuses for
policy-holders and of dividends for share-
holders have been pushed further into
the future. Owing to early extravagance,
this Amalgamated co., like most of the
post-war youngsters in the business, is
having a hard fight to get firmly on its
feet. Still, the present management con-
tinues to do better work than any of
its predecessors. Looked at as a whole
the business has moved in this way since
the merger:

1933.. 103,408 27,106 50,443 25,859
Last year interest receipts (£11,447) were
£2006 better, but net premiums (£91,961)
fell away £4077, notwithstanding that an
extra £72,495 of new business (£594,211)
was put on the books. The slip is due
largely to lapses, which retard develop-
ment by their effect upon costs. Exclud-
ing taxes (£2203) and a loss of £644 on
mortgages, exes, took 51.7 p.c. of the net
premiums as against 49.6 p.c. in ’32 and
72.5 p.c. in ’2B.
Again deducting taxes, the net interest
return was 3.36 p.c. on the mean life
fund. The office assumes that this fund
will earn 4 p.c.; recent reductions in
taxation should leave the net return
much nearer the mark.
An extra £25,949 of new Ordinary
business was written:
1929. 1932. 1933.
Policies .. .. 1,200 751 1,019
Assuring .. .. £288,805 £115,344 £141,293
First premiums .. 8,669 3,477 4,060
Renewal premiums .. 36,350 28,709 26,601
Splitting up administrative charges
(£20,693) in proportion to net premium
income, and assuming that new business
is 10 times more expensive than old, the
year’s first premiums cost 167 p.c. as
against 163 p.c. in 1932. Appearances are,
therefore, that renewals are being written
at less than the 19.4 p.c. allowed for.
In the Industrial section the amount of
new business was £46,546 better at
£452,918. Premium income (£55,591)
was £2439 less, but the surplus (£9072)
was £698 stronger, though exes, took 58.9
p.c. of the premiums as against 57.6 p.c.
in the previous term.
Assets are mostly the right stuff:

The year’s surplus (£25,859) and £4859
of fresh capital was nearly all invested in
Government securities. Though net tan-
gibles are now only £7272 short of the
life fund, it has been made plain that the
fund is not yet equal to liabilities under
policies.

Excepting 1921, that is easily the best
result since capital was doubled by the
issue of bonus scrip in 1920 ; and share-
holders look like remaining in the pic-
ture. After a trade war which did neither
co, any good, Cumberland and Austra-
lasian Paper and Pulp got into double
harness in 1926. Each passed its plant,
etc., to a new co., Australian Paper
Manufacturers, for scrip. Following
destruction of the Sydney mills by fire
in 1929, the manufacturing co. put up
smaller but more efficient plant at
Botany, improvements were made to the
Victorian equipment, finances were got
into better trim, and 4s. per share
(£320,000) was chipped off capital, re-
ducing it to £1,280,000, of which Cum-
berland owns £287,511, which figures in
its own sheet at £358,111 (cost).
At Sept. 30 Cumberland’s only other
asset was £19,721 of cash and deposits ;
the amount coming to creditors was £lOl.
Its £358,111 of capital is in 40,000 first,
108,111 second, and 60,000 third prefs.,
and 150,000 ords. The prefs. are all 8
p.c. cumulative, and advance with the
ords. beyond that rate, or beyond 6.2 p.c.
while the N. S. Wales Interest Reduction
Act remains in force. Last year’s profit
(the spring of £3214 was due to the
absence of provision for taxation) was
8.9 p.c. on capital, and an all-round 8 p.c.
was distributed.

Exchange and the tariff have brought
much business formerly placed overseas
this co.’s way, and earnings have bene-
fited, while selling prices have been re-
duced. Last year’s net result Cup
£12,071) was written after setting aside
£50,000 for the taxgatherer, £5OOO for
bad and doubtful debts, and adding
£65,306 net to the depreciation reserve
(£385,182). The div. was not announced ;
appearances are that it was 11 p.c. or
thereabouts.
The financial position improved, not-
withstanding the addition of £49,998 to
the book value of fixed assets:

The more or less liquid surplus (£537,125,
including stocks, but not shares) was
£30,852 stronger than at the previous
balance. If the co. decides to manufac-
ture its own pulp, there is a possibility
that shareholders may be asked for a bit
more.

For years returns from investments ex-
ceeded the annually mounting dividend
charge, leaving the surplus from a
steadily expanding underwriting business
available to swell investments and the
returns therefrom. The board was thus
able to keep the div. steady at 10 p.c., and
sweeten it with annual distributions of
bonus scrip—£325,000 of the £450,000 of
paid capital was thus provided out of
surplus earnings since 1912. But wider
policy-writing brought heavier claims,
and the gift-giving ceased about six years
ago. Then slump lightened premium in-
come, the fall in interest and rents
affected the return from investments
(now lumped in one untidy entry with
net premiums), and the London marine
business caused trouble. Thus a loss of
£12,022 showed up in 1932, and the div.
was cut in halves.
During the last term, marine under-
writing was severely curtailed ; total in-
come shrank £13,182, and claims were
£58,067 lighter:

The growth of £5940 in exes, suggests
that the contraction of income was partly
or wholly on account of returns from in-
vestments. Including minor reserve adjust-
ments, the net return from all sources
was a profit of £27,140, equal to a shade
over 6 p.c. on capital. The div. was lifted

Excelsior Collieries
This co.’s collieries consist of Excelsior
No. 1 and No. 2 at Thirroul and the
New Greta pit at Maitland (N.S.W.). The
latter has given the board a good deal of
worry lately. The loss on operating all
the co.’s properties amounted to £5777
for the year to June 30 last, compared
with £10,731 during the preceding 12
months. One of the directors, B. W.
Kirton, disagreed with the policy of the
rest of the board, and certain shareholders
recently requisitioned a meeting to give
him a hearing and settle the dispute. The
meeting lasted several hours, and the
upshot was that (by a vote of 6332 to
3385) Mr. Kirton was asked to resign.
Finances were weakened in 1931 when
3s. per share was handed back to share-
holders. Last balance-day £BlO7 was
owed to outsiders, against which there
were debtors, £5512; cash, £1262; and
mine, plant, stocks and goodwill, £146,315
(down £5567). Subject to the unspecified
amount of goodwill, reserves figured at
£34,482. The co. has renewed its con-
tracts with the Government, and has
secured several bunkering orders. The
board appears to be doing its best to cope
with a difficult situation.
Westralia has benefited considerably by
the revival in gold-mining. In 1930, 22
cos. were operating there ; now there are
about 50. Nearly all the fields have
attracted new capital. One of the biggest
investors is Western Mining Corp. It has
concessions aggregating approximately
88,000 square miles, which it is now pros-
pecting and mining. The principal share-
holders are North Broken Hill, Broken
Hill South, Zinc Corp., Electrolytic Zinc,
Imperial Smelting Corp., Central Mining
and Investment Corp., Case Pomeroy Co.,
Union Corp. and New Consolidated
Goldfields. Other important new arrivals
include Metals Investigation Pty., which
recently took over the Blue Cap, Kal-
goorlie, for £36,000; Anglo-Australian
Development, which raised £400,000 in
London to test six groups of old mines at
Phillips River, Murchison, Pilbarra and
elsewhere; Goldfields Australian De-
velopment, which has £300,000 to spend
and has taken options at Wiluna, Laver-
ton, Broad Arrow, Mount Monger, Sand-
stone, Ora Banda and Dunnsville;
Western Gold Mines, a Collins House
concern, which secured the Mararoa Co.’s
Reedy’s leases for £50,000, and passed
them on to the Triton and Lance-
field Cos., whose pockets are well lined.
Many smaller cos. floated in Adelaide,
a few formed in Melbourne, and one or
two in which Malayan Tin cos. are inter-
ested have also taken a hand. While
gold remains around its present price,
some of the holdings look like becoming
good dividend payers.
South Kalgurli has been the best and
most consistent div. payer in the West
of recent years. With one miss in 1917-18
it paid between 5 p.c. and p.c. annually
from 1913 to 1920. The distribution was
then lifted to 25 p.c., and maintained at
that figure until 1932, when it soared to
50 p.c., and last year 66 p.c. was handed
out. In addition 2s. 6d. a share was re-
turned in Dec., 1932, and a similar
amount was returned last month. Paid
capital is now £62,501 in 250,000 shares
of ss. each. An interim Is. is payable
on Jan. 16. The ore comes from the
co.’s own show on the Golden Mile and
from the near-by Croesus Prop., held
under lease from North Kalgurli.

The English Court of Appeal recently
decided that Golden Horseshoe (W.A.),
which is treating residues, was really a
manufacturer of raw material already
won from the soil, and not a goldmining
co. in the sense that the income-tax
authorities argued. Shareholders anxiously
await an announcement as to what the
board intends to do with the co.’s fine
wad of liquids. Cash in London and
Westralia amounts to nearly £140,000,
and investments in other cos. at cost,
£41,000. There are still many years of
profitable work ahead of the treatment
plant, but the remaining residues are of
lower average grade than those already
handled.
* * * *
Lake View, along with other Golden
Mile cos., recently paid those tributors
who won the appeal to the Privy Coun-
cil 50 p.c. of the premium on the sale of
gold won. Other tributors, who accepted
20 p.c. in settlement, have since pro-
ceeded against the co., and the local war-
den has awarded them another 30 p.c.,
holding that the agreement made was
void. The co. may appeal against this
decision.
* * * *
Some London capital has been sub-
scribed, and more is promised, to reopen
in a large way the old Yuanmi goldmine
on the East Murchison field (W.A.).
Nearly three-quarters of a million sterling
was extracted from this show by an Eng-
lish co. between 1912 and 1925. The lot,
plus capital running into six figures, was
swallowed in plant, development and an
unsuccessful attempt to make ends meet.
Operations were finally abandoned on
account of refractory ore and high costs.
But now that gold is up in price different
results are expected.
* * * *
The Associated twins, Associated Gold
(New) and Associated Mining and
Finance, were both registered in 1925,
one to take over the Westralian assets
and the other the Canadian interests of
the now defunct Associated Gold Mines
of W.A. Associated Gold (New) netted
£16,165 sterling last year, and £2165 was
brought in. Exes, and a 6d. div. left £l4B
to be carried forward. A surplus of
£8393 on investments realised was written
off the book value of property and plant,
reducing it to £68,973. The co.’s remain-
ing investments include share interests in
Associated Northern and Wiluna. Asso-
ciated Mining and Finance, which con-
tinues to be largely interested in Wiuna
and Associated Gold Mines, reports a
profit of £18,245, mostly from silver-
mining in Canada.
* * * *
London-controlled Star Explorations,
a finance and mining concern which used
to be wholly but is now only partially
interested in Westralian gold, netted
£BO4O on a capital of £47,400 for the year
to Sept. 30 last. A div. of 121 p.c. has
been declared. The co. kicked off years
ago with the tailings on Hannan’s Star,
now part of the Lake View holdings at
Kalgoorlie, and some cash as its chief
assets. Now its interests are widespread,
and the board talks of getting in more
capital to extend them.
.At W. Ingram’s battery, Davyhurst
(W.A.), N. George crushed 4| tons for
and tons of seconds for 13oz. ;
O’Brien, an assisted prospector, treated
16 tons for 12oz. At Broad Arrow,
another party of Government-assisted
prospectors got 270 z. from 2cwt. of
stone by the Berdan pan. One of the
partners sold his share for £5OO. Here
Melbourne interests are said to have
taken an option for £15,000, a high figure
for an undeveloped property.
* * * *
At the Sadie, Kunanalling (W.A.), a
crosscut on the 142 ft. level has passed
through stone lift, wide, carrying -}oz. of
gold per ton. This is on the same line of
lode as the Turn of the Tide, south of
Kunanalling township. Both leases are
being developed under option by the New
Venture Co.
* * * *
Kunanalling Gold has exercised its
option over W. H. Pearce’s leases, the
Melva Maie and Star of Fremantle,
Kunanalling (W.A.). The owner received
the balance of the purchase money
(£4000) and 6000 fully-paids last month.

E. J. O’Donnell, chairman of the
Debolina Mining Co., which for the last
10 months has been prospecting 1234
acres along the banks of the Tabiri River,
Papua, writes from the spot:
Whilst I do not entirely affirm the reports
which have found their way into southern
papers, I can definitely state that the result of
my co.’s investigations give every encourage-
ment. Platinum lumps have been found on
the Elaatu up to 3-jdwt.; nine pieces weighed
19dwt. On the Tabiri the metal is not so shotty,
and is much brighter and finer. The platinum
is apparently shed from the serpentine rock,
and is invariably associated with olivine and
augite. The country is intensely volcanic, with
breaks over a large area. Very little gold has
been won on the rivers or in the immediate
vicinity. The platinum occurs near the diorite
bars and is confined mainly to the riverbed.
Indications are found on the banks in a hard
reddish stone, which is the noorite oxidised.
Little occurs in the overburden, and one must
sometimes go through two false bottoms before
striking the good wash. A geologist with
platinum experience would find much to interest
him. There are problems, too, for the civil
engineer Eastern Papua has a future in plati-
num if it commands the attention of a strong
financial and well-equipped group.

At the Herberton tinfield (N.Q.) por-
tents are that the Great Northern may
close down unless success comes soon.
Operations at the 700 ft. level have partly
paid their way with blobs of good ore;
but these all seem to fizzle out. It used to
be the biggest mine on the field; next
came the Wild Irishman, which has not
shone for many a year. Still, a syndicate
which tackled it early in 1933 cut a shoot
on the 250 ft. level, and the first 27 tons
crushed averaged £6. The Canberra and
Cornishman are the main producers at
present. There has lately been increased
activity on the Deep Lead, for a bag of
tin now brings £8 on the field.
* * * *
An extensive system of prospecting re-
lief at Charters Towers fN.Q.) keeps 50
men off the dole, and the State Battery
there is a godsend to the individual pros-
pector. During November fossickers
rooted out 300 tons from shallow work-
ings for about 200 oz.
* * * *
Apart from large-scale company oper-
ations now being inaugurated at Gympie
(Q.)on the Great Northern and Inglewood
areas, half a dozen prospecting syndicates
have been testing the extremities of the
field at Two Mile and Dawn. For the
last two years the work has yielded in-
significant results. A new co. has lately
taken up the Dawn, which produced some
thousands of ounces in the early days.

Kingston Gold Mines, near Brisbane,
has rarely recorded more than 2dwt. per
ton, and its November figures (1100 tons
for 820 z., or are about a record
for low-grade working in Queensland. A
throw-in was the recovery of an extra
420 z. from the clean-up of the old mill.
Recoveries have not been considered
good enough, and a new milling system
has just been installed with dry crushing.

Six months ago Carpenter Creek Tin,
Stanthorpe (Q.), installed a ten-head bat-
tery in two units, ore-breaker, com-
pressors, classifiers, etc., at a cost of some
£BOOO, but didn’t have enough in the till
to commence work. Sufficient money has
now been obtained for a short run, and
stone is being taken from the Evening
Star lode, which is sft. wide and assays
3 p.c. tin oxide. In the Kyooma-Sugar-
loaf district tributors, who are working
three dredges, have won 28 tons of tin,
worth £5066, over the last three months.
Some 80 stream-tinners collected about
£l4BB worth of t.o. in the last quarter.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
{Transferred from Service Department.)
Briefly, the practice followed at Wiluna (W.A.)
for the recovery 0/ sulphur and gold from sul-
phides ? —9192.
At none of the mines in Westralia is sulphur
obtained as a by-product, though there is the
possibility that electrical precipitation of
sulphur may be considered. At Wiluna the ore
is passed through rockbreakers, Simon cone-
crushes, ball mills and tube mills. The pulp,
thickened with mechanical thickeners, is then
passed through the flotation plant. The flota-
tion concentrate is filtered in a vacuum filter of
the Oliver type, and dried and roasted in the
ordinary reverberatory roasting furnace. The
concentrate contains sufficient sulphur to make
it self-roasting The flue gases are passed to the
arsenic recovery section of the plant, which is
run by Victor Leggo and Co., of Victoria, who
handle the product. The roasted concentrate
is cyanided in the ordinary way.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
A.McC.: (1) Lead ore and red ochre are
not quoted in the open market. The value of
lead ore depends mainly upon the percentage
of lead present and the texture of the stone.
The price of red ochre is determined chiefly
by strength and color. Manganese 50 p.c. ore
is quoted in London at per unit, or £1
19s. 7d. per ton. (2) Write to Frank Hambridge,
22 Bridge-street, Sydney; L. Burkard, 250 Pitt-
street, Sydney; Minerals, Ltd., Botany-road,
Alexandria W.J.R.: The results exist in
theory only. Much more than a knowledge of
how tcp multiply one figure by another is needed
to build up a successful business... .F.A.G.:
Stay where you are. The office is quite sound,
and has thus far paid extraordinarily good
bonuses. Beyond reduction in the rate of
bonus, policy-holders have little to fear
Jarga: (1) It is quite a genuine concern. (2)
No. (3) Yes, provided the co. is not being
wound up under the supervision of the Court.
But without consent of creditors it must be for
cash, not shares in another concern. (4) Any
number of the old depositors may assign their
individual rights for a valuable consideration-
this would not affect the position of the re-
mainder. .. .R.D.: It is a long-term speculation,
and the business is heavily capitalised. Still,
you may now lose more by discontinuing than
by completing your payments.


SHADOW SHOWS
“Song of Songs,” which has appeared
simultaneously at Melb. Capitol and
Sydney Prince Edward, is one of those
stupendous productions in which no ex-
penditure of time, money and technical
knowledge on the part of the producer
has been spared to surround Marlene
Dietrich with an aura of romance. Also,
there are stray bits of genuine charac-
terisation such as the baron who spirits
Marlene away from her sculptor lover,
makes her a baroness because she is too
pure to be his mistress and proceeds to
educate her in music, singing and other
ladylike accomplishments so that she will
be a credit to his ancestors. But at
bottom the plot, which is alleged to be
Sudermann’s but isn’t, is in the penny-
novelette class.
Why does Brian Ahearne abandon
Marlene because she interferes with his
sculpture and then suddenly fall in love
with her again? And why, when Mar-
lene smashes his statue of her to pieces
out of jealousy, does he take her in his
arms as if she had done him a favor?
If he thought it was a good statue he
would have wanted to smash her.
The Dietrich is beautiful and, far, far
better from a movie producer’s stand-
point, she is odd. She conveys her emo-
tions with restraint, as a
rule, but never by any
chance does she reveal
the vestige of a sense of
humor. The character
she presents would bore
any intelligent man in a
very short time ; and the
public is asked to believe
that her happy endings
are happy beginnings,
warranted to last for
ever!
“Too Much Harmony”
is just another back-
stager. The principal
crooner, Bing Crosby, is
as insipid as ever, Judith
Allen does well as the
little girl from the coun-
try circuit who has her
first big chance and cap-
tures the star, and Jack
Oakie relinquishes her
as nicely as he has re-
linquished a dozen other
girls in similar situations
in the past. The songs
and ballet numbers are
up to sample, and some
of the lighting effects are
interesting.
“Counsel’s Opinion,” at Sydney Plaza,
is a British production with a fine cast.
Unfortunately the star performers have
small parts. Harry Tate makes a brief
appearance as an exasperated taxi-driver
in a London fog. Lawrence Grossmith
is an elderly husband who wants to get,
rid of his wife, and Cyril Maude is his
somewhat improbable solicitor. Most
of the action is in the hands of Henry
Kendall and Binnie Barnes. She gets
held up at a West End hotel by the fog
already mentioned, and insists —in all
innocence, be it understood —on sharing
his room. Now he is a barrister. (There
are some attractive shots of his “set” in
the Middle Temple, by the way.) What
more natural than that Maude should
bring Grossmith to him for an opinion,
Grossmith’s wife having been beleaguered
in a hotel on the night of the fog and
having shared a room with a strange
man? The complications arise from
Kendall’s assumption that Grossmith’s
wife was the lady who sojourned with
him. *
Binnie Barnes might become a star
under a first-class Hollywood director.
She has a profile, a figure and a Garbo-
like gift for conveying depravity. Her
present trouble is that she lacks Garbo’s
capacity for repose. Like most English
screen-actresses she acts hard all the time.
Henry Kendall is actorish, too, in appear-
ance as well as in his ways. Maude and
Grossmith are delightful to watch and
listen to, and the photography is above
the British average.
The story of “Jennie Gerhardt,” as
told by Theodore Dreiser, was a work
of art in spite of its melodrama ; in the
film version the melodrama remains, but
most of the art has vanished. Sylvia
Sidney makes Jennie so consistently
lugubrious that the onlooker feels that
her original betrayer had a lucky escape
in being killed in a train accident, and
that Donald Cook (the young man who
takes up with her when she comes as a
servant to his father’s house) was well
advised to put her out of his life. A
man doesn’t rise to be a multi-million-
aire and a business adviser to U.S.A.
Presidents with a life-companion who,
from youth to old age, looks, in prac-
tically all circumstances, as if she had
just swallowed a dose of castor-oil. The
pity of it is that on the rare occasions
when the lady exchanges her chronically
nauseated expression for a reluctant
smile she looks charming. Mary Astor
looks particularly beautiful in this one,
and there is some naturalistic acting by
a small girl.

Up to a point “Deluge,” at Sydney
Capitol, makes an impression. The im-
pression is not much helped by shots of
meteorologists who record a fantastic
concatenation of conditions (an unex-
pected eclipse, steadily falling barometer
all the world over, phenomenal earth-
quakes and tides many yards above
normal), because the meteorologists evi-
dently aren’t anything but supers. In-
genious glimpses of a toy N’Yark totter-
ing to its doom in a soup-plate (steel-
framed buildings, by the way, don’t col-
lapse like cards) also fail to grip the
vitals. But the music covers some bald
spots in the sequences. It is like the
howling of the gale and the mutter of
SYDNEY TALKIES.
In "You Made Me Love You,” at the Lyceum: (1) Thelma Todd; (2) Lupino
Lane. In “A Pasport to Paris,” on the same bill: (3) Andrews Engle-
mann; (4) Sally Eilers; (5) Ben Lyon; (6) Harry Tate; (7) H. T. Maltby.
the thunder with which Verdi empha-
sised the assassination of Rigoletto’s
daughter.
It drums on until the habitable world,
shaken like a jelly and inundated _ with
salt water, is purged of all its inhabitants
save a few persons miraculously sur-
viving in the neighborhood of America’s
largest city. These are Peggy Shannon
(who escapes in spotless brassiere and
panties, and through all her subsequent
tempestuous adventures keeps her hair
smartly crimped, her eyebrows plucked
and her lips heavily enamelled); Sidney
Blackmer (who though he lost his wife
and two kids managed to salvage his
safety-razor, and who devises for his
fellow-castaway broadcloth trousers and
silk shirts which fit as well as his own),
and 300 dubs who have no sartorial or
cosmetic attention. Poor Miss Shannon
has to spend most of her time swimming
(swimming done by some young woman
with a less precious appearance), for in
the end the hero’s wife, Lois Wilson (as
heavily hand-painted and barbered as
ever), turns up, with the two kids. The
last half of the film is occupied with
Mr. Blackmer fighting off a crowd of
unenamelled men who don’t see why he
should have two women. So Miss
Shannon swims away (or at least her
understudy does) and the cause of mono-
gamy in a world that contains 300 men
and two women is triumphantly estab-
lished. Where Miss Shannon swam to
in a ruined world is her business.
Preceding “Deluge” is “The Mys-
terious Rider” —novel by Zane Grey ;
acting by Kent Taylor, Lona Andre and
that prince of elderly villains Berton
Churchill. Ingredients of this typical
Western are a stolen receipt, eviction of
settlers by land sharks, and a sufficient
number of imbeciles (including a sheriff
who leaves his gaol and the keys of the
cells in the care of a child of six) to make
the proceedings physically possible. Kent
Taylor is one of those lads whose faithful
hoss is so intelligent that when his master
has been in gaol for a month the horse is
still patiently waiting underneath the
window so that the hero can vault
straight into the saddle and go careering
off to hold up mobs of 100 men single-
handed, prove his innocence and win
the goil.

“Looking Forward,” at the Regent,
carries three brilliant studies —Lewis
Stone as the head of a London shop
which is going under; Lionel Barrymore
as one who has been 40 years with the
firm, but has to go ; and Elizabeth Allan
as Stone’s daughter. The story is thin.
Stone thinks his wife and children are
interested in the business only for the
money it brings in, and decides to sell
out. Meanwhile his wife has left him,
and it looks as though the youngsters will
do the same. They don’t. Instead they
determine to put the store on its feet
again. We hope they can. As a New
Year show it should be helpful.
In “Good-bye Again” Warren William,
a writer of best-sellers, is loved by Joan
Blondell, his secretary. Half-way through
a lecture tour they meet a romantic
female who believes she is the novelist’s
inspiration and soul mate. The lady’s
husband and a friend, a lawyer, complete
the cast. William makes the hero the
kind of literary person who jumps on
chairs at parties, and Joan Blondell re-
mains Joan Blondell. Interesting in
places, but the casting kills it.

A Melbourne view of two films that
Sydney has seen:
The latest pictures at the State almost enter
the A 1 class. “The Little Giant” is the story
of a retired gangster who wants to get into
society. He becomes engaged to a damsel
who is as much an upper-class crook as he
is an underworld one. She beats him at every
point until he reverts to type, and fights her
with his own weapons.
Edward Robinson is dull, heavy, sentimental,
primitive—everything you expect a gangster
to be —and the situations he figures in are
appropriately farcical.
The defect of “Blonde Bombshell” is its
length; it palls before the finish. The pro-
ducer has used all the resources of the screen
as they ought to be used. The crispness of
the dialogue, the continual succession of re-
vealing details and the machine-gun rapidity
of incident show what can be done with the
medium. Nor is the psychology of the char-
acters lost sight of. Jean Harlowe is the typi-
cal moronic movie star whose press-agent capi-
talises her doings on lines of scandal. She
likes the publicity, but would rather it was
more respectable. She is the accepting type of
woman, however; every man she meets
takes charge of her and she gets handed on
from one to the other like a piece of luggage.
At one stage she becomes maternal and adopts
an infant, but is checkmated by the publicity
man, who prefers her to be the nation’s sweet-
heart, for trade purposes.
Lee Tracy, as the press-agent, works at
express speed.
Sundry Shows
The Rolls Christmas panto. “Dick
Whittington and His Cat,” at Sydney Cri.,
is unfolded in 25 scenes, contains 31
assorted ditties and dances (described in
the programme as “musical numbers”)
and occupies 3| hours in performance.
The play distorts historical facts, confus-
ing them with circumstances connected
with “Puss-in-Boots.” Furthermore it
consigns the cat to exile and slavery while
his feckless master makes no better
approach to a successful commercial
career than suffering an eviction. At that
stage there is an interlude by roller-
skaters and an excursion into Bluebeard’s
Palace, and in the finale it is shown that
it is entirely due to the cat, brought back
by the grateful sultan who held him in
thrall, that Richard marries his employer’s
daughter and embarks on a career as a
captain of industry. There’s no mention
of even a small spot of work on the part
of anyone but the cat and the cook. Ten
million miles from Samuel Smiles and
Dr. Watts, the fantasy was framed to
chime with the holiday spirit. Young-
sters, no matter how many movies they
have seen, like it because it is three-
dimensional and full of color, because
there’s such an awful lot of it, and, oddly
enough in this immoral age, because they
see a moral. Oldsters grin at the jests,
some of which are blue-edged, and all of
which are very old, and hope they are
flying over the heads of small sons and
daughters. Present critic was among the
hopers. His young charges came away
oblivious of all else but the nobility and
unselfishness of the cat. Billy Kershaw,
who represented that faithful animal, can
congratulate himself on having played at
least one truly heroic role.
# * *
As the only provider of panto, of pre-
sent festive season in Melbourne, Frank
Neil will get all the business flowing in
that direction, but he would get a bit
for “Cinderella” even if there was com-
petition, for the unpretentious Palace
show has the advantage of Josie Melville
in the name part, and Josie is capable of
giving a gentle touch of art and a re-
freshing grace to any part. Moreover,
the ancient story is not as crazily-con-
structed as most, and the inevitable inter-
ruptions of girl and whirl and Syd Beck,
while not unduly staggering to the adult
.eye, ought to satisfy any unsophisticated
juvenile, if there are any unsophisticated
juveniles nowadays. As one of the Ugly
Sisters, Syd Beck, who needn’t have
troubled to put on any make-up, for his
face is his fortune, is funny without being
unduly vulgar, and Miriam Lester fills
Prince Charming’s tights in a more than
satisfactory manner. Hilda Lane sup-
plies the Fairy Queen with a soprano
which has almost the vocal avoirdupois
of a canary, and produces out of her hat
a glittering fairy coach and two real
ponies. The royal ballroom, the sub-
marine excursion and other spectacles
overflow with splendor, and Demon
Nightshade (Harry Ratcliffe) helps to pro-
long the agony by stealing the crystal
slipper. On the opening night he was
purloining the footwear what time a thief
outside was purloining critic’s decrepit
motor-car, and Prince Charming was fit-
ting the slipper to Cinderella’s tiny foot
in a scene of unimaginable splendor
what time the Footscray police were re-
covering the stolen chariot. Fact isn’t
half as interesting as fiction.
Sydney said good-bye to Captain
Adkins’s band at the Town Hall on the
last night but one of 1933, and the part-
ing was full of regrets. Highlights of
the programme were the “Meistersingers”
overture and Liszt’s No. 2 Rhapsody,
both delivered in the orchestral rather
than in the brass-band manner. Alan
McCristal was soloist in a movement
from a Mendelssohn concerto. Most
popular piece of the evening was a Wald-
teufel waltz by full band.

A newly-formed company, under
Gregan McMahon’s direction, filled the
gap in the intellectual provender menu
that usually occurs at Christmas by stag-
ing Barrie’s “Dear Brutus” at the Gar-
rick, Melbourne. Other comedies and
farces are billed to follow.


A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A LEAGUER.
(As it seems to a student of the cablegrams.)


ABORIGINALITIES
“Turoar”: “Singing Joe” was explain-
ing why he hadn’t voted at a Federal
by-election. Said Joe: “The bloke tells
me ‘Yer name’s not on the roll, Joe.’
An’ neither it were, dammit. So he
wouldn’t give me a vote —not even a
absent-minded vote.”
* * * *
“Walkabout”: Dunno when “Pat
Bushie” (B. 6/12/’33) saw Poole Island,
but last time I camped there I didn’t
come across any “kangaroos, brumbies,
wild pigs, snakes, lizards, goannas, wild
ducks and turkeys, and hosts of other
animals and birds.” The waterless speck
is held on lease by a mainland dweller,
half a mile away, and the only animals
visible are a few old goats and quiet
horses. There are oysters there, and good
fishing from the rocks, but the necessity
for frequent trips to Bowen to buy meat
and replenish the water-tins detracts from
the spot’s popularity as a holiday resort.
* * * *
“Si Anu”: A method of dealing a
knock-out blow to the depression which
should appeal to Australian politicians
has been revived in Malacca, the sleepy
old Malayan city which was founded by
the Portuguese 400 years ago. Local
Chinese priests decided that the time had
come to turn the corner, and revived the
Wangkang festival, which had not been
NESTLING KPPKABURRA: “Our dinner gets later and later, since the old man’s on
the talkies and mum’s on the radio.”
observed for 14 years. Special craftsmen
were brought from China, and a large
model of a junk was constructed. It was
equipped with priceless embroideries,
valuable tapestries and rtiagnificent lan-
terns and many of the nails in the hull
were’of pure gold. The seven necessities
of life were loaded into it, including
thousands of red bags containing rice,
salt and tea, tinned preserves, bundles of
firewood ; in short, all the requisites of
the average Celestial kitchen. The crew
preceded it under a gorgeous silken
canopy, walking over a specially-con-
structed bridge of ancient design, along
two miles of decorated thoroughfare,
while the rear was brought up by the tung
chees, or professional ascetics, who rouse
the compassion of the demons and evil
spirits by thrusting iron pins through
their cheeks. Behind the ceremony is the
world-wide idea, described in Frazer’s
“Golden Bough,” of luring the spirits of
sickness, etc., on a vessel, and setting the
craft afloat on a river or the sea, so that it
will carry away the local troubles and
bestow them on some other community.
The junketing lasted 14 days, thousands
of cars blocked every street, the popula-
tion was temporarily trebled, 100,000
visitors thronged the hotels, the shops did
a roaring trade and the crisis vanished
from Malacca overnight.
H:
“Bloss”: I had an orphaned foal
which, despite all persuasion to drink,
would only stand wobbling dangerously
on its long, skinny legs and refuse to
suck the nippled bottle. At last I gave
it up, and left him lying in the yard while
I milked our few cows. Master Foal
watched three calves share their mothers’
milk with me. No sooner had 1 bailed
up the fourth cow than a little thin
whinny came, from the far corner;
the foal, getting up awkwardly, staggered
over to the cow and, after a bit of head-
shaking and nosing round, started in and
had a dashed good drink. That solved
the problem. I turned the placid old
Jersey out, and she reared her calf, plus
a jolly good sprinter.
* * * *
“Avon”: The depression is disturbing
the amiability of Henare, Wiremu and
Timi. The Maori race was left in pos-
session of a fair amount of land, and
hitherto this has sufficed to provide a
living. The chiefs, near-chiefs and the
more industrious and enterprising of
their kin have either farmed their hold-
ings or lived on rentals ; the lesser lights
have been able to make a do of it on
day-labor, backed up by ownership or
some sort of feudal tenure of a spot of
land. But now rents aren’t being paid
and, with prices of farm products not
what they were, there isn’t much demand
for sturdy Maori muscles. And when
Henare goes on the dole he finds that
the fact that he has a bit of rent-free
land to live on weighs heavily with the
dole authority. It was alleged in Parlia-
ment recently that, whereas a workless
pakeha with three or more children gets
335. 9d. a week, a Maori, no matter how
numerous his olive-branches, can’t draw
more than a quid. Pondering over these
matters, Hikoi Paora, chief of the Ngati
Whatua, entered upon Crown land,
ploughed it and sowed a crop of spuds,
Haled before an Auckland magistrate, he
said he wasn’t satisfied that the Crown
had a good title to the land (a Select
Committee of Parliament has that
squabble under review); that his people
were destitute, and that he had to do
something for them. He added that if
the Crown wanted to put him off the
land it could do so only over his dead
body. The magistrate, after hearing that
the Crown had paid £2 compensation to
the lessee of the land (who apparently
wasn’t using it), fined the chief £2 for
trespass, but declined to make an order
for eviction. A wise man.

“ Black water”: Sydney Health Depart-
ment was mildly stirred at Christmas over
the discovery of a genuine, home-brewed
case of malaria in the Botany district.
The patient had never been out of Syd-
“Nice, soft, friendly li'l' cat outside an’ nasty, big, fierce cat inside.”
ney and there was no malarial history in
the family circle. This is the seventh
case of late years to occur in N.S.W., and
they have been scattered all over the
State. Whence came the infected mos-
quitoes responsible for the cases and how
they became infected is, like the birth
of Jeames Yellowplush, “wropped in
mystery.” Malaria is endemic in
Northern Australia, and the anopheles
mosquito is common everywhere. It is
barely possible the poisonous mosquitoes
came from the North on board ship—
indoor dwellers from preference, they
are great travellers in this way—and got
in one bite before going the way of all
mosquitoes. Possibly also some un-
recorded malarial patient from the
Islands or the North acted as host to a
local anopheles who passed the good
work on. The moral is that, given suit-
able conditions, the more southerly parts
of Australia are by no means immune
from the visitations of tropical diseases.
Brisbane, not so far to the north, has
been wracked on occasion with the mos-
quito-borne dengue fever, and filaria is
also not unknown there.
* * * *
“Tamata”: The feud between the Fly
River Kiwais and other Papuan races
(B. 20/12/’33) is no new thing. It dates
from the days when the white man came
to Papua and found the hook-nosed
ruffians from the west a manlier
and more reliable lot than most of their
fellow-countrymen. For long the Kiwai
formed the bulk of that splendid force
the Armed Native Constabulary, his
courage and forceful personality being
outstanding. As a “boss boy” he was
also in a class by himself, being almost
alone among Papuans in his capacity to
exert authority. Even in the constabu-
lary he was unpopular with his fellows
from other tribes. On one occasion in
the Northern Division a huge German
miner from the Girs feigned madness in
order to get free transport to Samarai,
and gave a lot of trouble. To the police
the Germanic jabbering was of great in-
terest. When we had got rid of him,
Joe, a little yellow corporal from Cloudy
Bay, ventured on a question. “Taubada,”
he said, “that fella countryman belong
you?” “No,” I answered, “he belong
’nother fella country, long way he stop,
no good that fella” —this was long be-
fore 1914. “Ah,” replied Joe, a grin of
enlightenment splitting his features, “all
same Kiwai!”
* * * *
“Isee”: One of our station pets was a
baby ’roo. This joey, named Billy, had
a bell tied to his neck to distinguish him
from the wild ’roos when hunters were
about. He lived about the house-paddock
till he grew quite a big chap ; then the
bush called. For days we watched sadly
for his return. It came in the most sen-
sational manner. About 60 hoppers of all
sizes thundered past the homestead in
wild flight, while in the rear, vainly try-
ing to catch up, was our Billy, every
i angle of his bell adding to the terror
of the mob. He didn’t stop to renew
acquaintances, but swept on. We never
saw him again.
* * * *
“Curucucu”: Australia isn’t the only
place where they have succeeded in estab-
lishing snake anti-venines (B. 6/12/ ’33).
FitzSimons, of South Africa, claims that
he has not only obtained individual
serums but a general one which is an
antidote to all the African snake poisons.
For years past the great Government
snake-farm at San Paolo, in Brazil, has
been experimenting on similar lines.
Here also it is claimed that a polyvalent
serum has been obtained which is effec-
tive against every known species of
poisonous snakes. The Brazilian scien-
tists have gone further and hope to even-
tually rid their country of the many
species of deadly snakes which infest it.
To this end they are going in for large-
scale breeding of the mussuranna, a
powerful non-venomous snake which
lives only on other snakes. It is immune
to snake venom and is a relentless foe
of all serpents it encounters. The coun-
try is being flooded with propaganda in
favor of the mussuranna, with the idea
of familiarising the population with its
appearance and so preventing its destruc-
tion.

“Barang”: Cable operators at Cocos
get whisky direct from Scotland, the stuff
being stored in the Singapore bond until
the quarterly boat leaves for the atoll.
They pay no duty on the spirits. Whisky
sold in Australia at 13s. 6d. a bottle is
3s. Id. in the Cocos mess ; Dutch gin is
Is. 6d. a large bottle. At that the mess
makes a small profit on spirits, which
goes towards reducing the price of Aus-
tralian ale.

“Endiadere”: To an old Papuan hand
one of the trials of retirement is the host
of amateurs who nowadays hold forth in
the press and on platforms concerning
Papuan and New Guinea matters with
which they have a bare bowing acquaint-
ance. One such, lecturing in Sydney the
other day, spoke of head-hunting as if
it was universal all over, Papua, instead
of being confined, as it ' is, to certain
localities. Further, the lecturer stated
that the “Tugeri of Western Papua” were
the worst head-hunters of them all. The
Tugeri are not Papuans—they hail from
far inside the south-eastern border of
Dutch New Guinea. They have not been
seen in Papuan waters for 40 years, but
in days gone by they were the source of
considerable friction between the Nether-
lands Indies Government and the Colonial
Office, which in those times ran British
New Guinea —now Papua. Of course
the lecturer rounded off with the story
of the shipload of Chinese coolies wrecked
on Rossel Island who were fattened and
eaten, to the number of 320 (there’s
nothing like exactness in these matters),
by the natives of that island paradise.
William MacGregor, who inquired most
closely into that business, scouted the idea
of its ever happening—and he conducted
his inquiries on the spot.
* * * *
“Copperhead”: The cabled announce-
ment that a French professor has dis-
covered that cobra venom injected in
tiny doses has a wonderful effect in
alleviating pain in cancer repeats an old
story. From time immemorial Hindu
medicine-men have been familiar with
this property of snake venom, and its use
is still common in many parts of India.

“Mako”: There certainly is a hearty
thoroughness about Henare when he gets
the joy-riding urge. A M.L. citizen was
disturbed one night by a tremendous
noise at the rear of his house, and crept
to an upstairs window to listen. He soon
traced the uproar to his garage, whence
proceeded yells, bumps, howls, crashes
and awful language. With the support
of a neighbor he went out to investigate,
and discovered a large Maori trying to
start his new car. The police removed
Henare, who announced cheerfully that
he would be round later to have another
try.

“Bush Chef”: One often hears of the
delights of the chop or steak grilled in
the bush over an open fire. If the cook-
ing is done (as it often is) by placing
the meat on top of the live coals after
the fire has burned down, the delights are
not likely to be realised. The proper way
is to build a fire of small sticks (box-
wood is best) and when this is well alight
stand up a double griller, with chops or
steak inside, in front of the fire, propped
up with a green forked stick. Regulate
distance according to heat. The griller
is turned round as required, and
about ten minutes usually suffice to
complete the job to perfection. Have
the plates warming near the fire and
don’t put salt and pepper on the grill
until it is cooked. The meat should be
young and fat, and hung for several days.

“Homfrey Beale”: A little-known
spider of the north-east is the black-
coated, grey-paunched, bright-yellow-
jointed, hirsute-legged nightmare known
to the few whites acquainted with it as
the “Lord Mayor,” owing to its protuber-
ant stomach. It is the giant of its kind
in Australia, attaining as much as 10
inches of a leg-spread and a thickness
of over three inches. The small head is
composed chiefly of strong jaws, which
are used solely for hanging on tQ dead
prey. The monstrosity lives on the blood
of birds which become entangled in its
web-snare.. The web is of a light golden
hue, and so strong that a dozen strands
plaited make a quite respectable fishing-
line, a use to which Binghi often puts
them. The circular snares are rarely
under 10 feet in diameter, and more often
run to 15 feet and over. A small bird
striking it has no hope of escape, for
besides being strong the web is viscous.
As the captive struggles the web-owner
runs feverishly round mending the torn
places. When the victim is dead the
spider rushes to the feast, and by means
of an arrangement like a doctor’s blood-
testing pump gorges till its stomach re-

“Dai R.”: The common assertion of
bush botanists that the insect-snaring
grass Cenchrus australis, otherwise “fly-
catcher,” common to the eastern coast,
pursues its carnivorous pranks merely as
a sport is quite erroneous. The parent is
feeding the child —an unusual infant that
demands blood. When the hairs which
cover the seed-pods adhering to the stem
surmounting the plant proper are touched
by an insect, besides the curl-
ing process of imprisonment a
suctional operation is started,
by means of which the juices
of the captive are absorbed
into the hairs and thence down
their hollow centres to the
podded seeds.
These assimilate it
until the full course
prescribed by Dr.
Nature has been
a c c o m p 1 i s hed,
when, ready for
business, they fall to the ground. In
southern Queensland I robbed a selected
P lant of animal nourishment as soon as
ca P tured - A t the end of three weeks
the seeds had shrivelled in the pods to
the size of pinheads, and when I touched
them they disintegrated, though the
general health of the parent plant was
not affected. The seeds of neighboring
plants, not interfered with, fell and ger-
minated.

“Ben Nevis”: “Unlawfully wearing
clothing on the upper part of the body,”
mentioned by “Kaloa” (B. 6/12/’33), is a
punishable offence in Papua, because when
the natives were wearing shirts it was
found that they developed chest troubles
and skin diseases never before known to
them. Quite frequently the shirt would
be drenched with the sudden tropical
rain, but the native would not change,
and would even sleep in the wet garment.
Indeed he would be so proud of the shirt
that quite frequently he would not part
with it till it wore off him. Accordingly,
“My missus doesn’t care for Jinks. Says he WILL persist in shouting.”
“She’s wrong. He always drinks with the flies. I’ve never known him to shout.”
this law had to be passed, and more
than one boxful of clothing sent from
Australia by kind-hearted ladies to
“clothe the poor, naked natives” has been
burned as soon as opened. The native
constable wears a uniform, but he has an
officer to make him change his wet
clothes when necessary. As a reward for
good behavior a boy working under white
people is given a permit by a magistrate
to don the much-desired shirt.
* * * *
“Mundowie”: Christmas is the peak
time of the beetle-catchers on the
Queensland canefields, when millions of
the pest are trapped with lights and sheets
at night, or shaken from the boughs into
wet grass in the morning. The beetlers
usually work in pairs—shaker and
catcher. The latter has a sheet spread
on the ground with a bright lantern
placed in the centre of it; the shaker
is armed with a long, hooked stick with
which he agitates the boughs where the
quarry is roosting. The disturbed swarms
fly to the light and drop on the sheet,
where they are grabbed by the catcher
and put in tins. Some use tubs with a
little water in them, a lantern on a tri-
pod above them completing the trap. The
mills pay a shilling a pound for the
beetles, a cane levy of 2d. a ton from
tne growers providing the fund. The
harvest lasts from a couple of weeks to
a month, during which time nearly the
whole population of some cane towns
goes beetling. Individual tallies run to
£l5 a week, while aggregate payments
reach huge sums. In one season over
£4OOO was paid on the Herbert River,
representing 16,000,000 beetles.
* * * *
“Trapsetter”: I disagree with “Black
Mountain” (B. 6/12/’33) when he says
that the midnight round is not a paying
proposition for the rabbit-trapper. His
pen-name suggests New England, and
perhaps N.E. bunnies stay at home
around the witching hour. Any trap-
per who wants to make the job pay, quite
irrespective of districts, does his three
rounds —just after sundown, midnight,
and near-to-dawn. A lot depends upon
the country and on skill in placing sets.
A bad set in a good possie will bring
nothing save an occasional adventurous
doe, but if you can catch rabbits (and
not many can) you should be able to
average 11 rabbits per trap. If you can’t
do as well as that, you’d better stay on
the dole.
* * * *
“Double Disc”: “Snahhan’s” par. (B.
6/12/’33) gives the erroneous impression
that the adder has the most virulent
venom of all Australian poisonous
snakes. The mortality from deaf-adder
bites is 50 per cent., and from tiger-snake
bites 45 per cent., but if the tiger-snake
had fangs as big as those of the deaf-
adder its bite would invariably prove to
be fatal. Taking the toxicity of the
Indian cobra’s venom as 1, the tiger-
snake’s and copperhead’s poison rates
25, and the deaf-adder’s 10. The black-
snake’s is a bad last, with one-third the
toxicity of the cobra’s. The adder’s bites
show a higher percentage of fatalities
because of its larger fangs and almost
perfect mechanical action when biting.
Fortunately for mankind, the tiger-
snake’s small fangs (barely one-quarter
of an inch in length) do not allow the
reptile to introduce into the blood-stream
anything like the quantity of venom
which the deaf-adder gives its victim.
* * * *
“Isee”: The Wame River, Delta Divi-
sion, Papua, is no tourist showplace, but
those who have business with the saw-
mill, are treated to one of the most
glorious sights in nature if they take the
trip at night. Millions and millions of
fireflies smother the bushes and trees
with a radiant, scintillating mantle of
light. One’s first impression is of a grand
fireworks display, for these luminous
flies (about the size of our common house
fly) close and emit their light in unison,
each bush seeming to have its own tim-
ing. For miles one passes through this
fairyland and sees many groups of
illumined trees nestling in the bends of
the river, their glittering branches over-
hanging the banks and making brilliant
reflections in the placid water.

“Kali”: Yesterday I discovered the
arch murderer of cicadas. Working be-
neath my camphor laurels I heard a slight
thud, and a Black Monday dropped at
my feet, to be followed a moment later
by one of the largest wasps I have yet
seen. He was a fierce orange-and-black
monster, about an inch in length, and he
wasted no time in straddling the motion-
less cicada ; then, dragging and pushing
with his hind legs, he set off towards the
bottom of the garden. Beneath a bunch
of dry leaves the wasp made his way,
and with a final heave pushed his burden
down a tunnel and disappeared after it.
1 wo minutes later he reappeared, took a
good look around, and set off again for
the camphor laurel. There was another
sudden break in a shrill song and an-
other cicada flopped to earth, but as the
wasp made for his victim I put in some
good work with a spade. On investigat-
ing the burrow, I found a perfect net-
work of tunnels and, stored at the ends,
22 cicadas. Anybody know the name of
the killer?

Pick : Brumbies display a lightness
and sureness of foot that tamed horses
cannot equal. When wild mobs roamed the
Kiandra plains (N.S.W.), their plan of
ercaoe, if chased, was to skim across the
shaking bogs. Scarcely a toe mark would
be left by them, but the following stock-
horses would flounder to their shoulders
in the mud. The passage-way between
rocky pinnacles on the banks of the Snowy
is barred by an acre of smooth, sloping
rock kept always slippery from an upside
seepage. A wide transverse chasm ex-
tends across the middle of the area. Flee-
ing brumbies make the dangerous spot
their regular get-away. In mad career
they slide over the slippery-dip, leap the
crevasse and, with all fours propped
ligidly, skate to the flat below. Not one
has ever been seen to fall.
BY THE LAKE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I was there alone, not dreaming
But awake,
In that grove beside the margin
Ot the lake.
Came no seawind, came no landwind
There to croon
In the she-oaks; all was soundless
’Neath the moon.
Ears alert —the lake anigh me
Deep and clear —
Not a footfall, not a birdcall
Did 1 hear.
Stirless lay its velvet waters,
Lapped in rest;
Danced no ripple, raced no ripple
O’er its breast.
On a silver track the moon made
O’er its tide
Sable swans lay, still and muted,
Side by side.
Came no whimper, came no harsh cry,
Through the hush
From the wildfowl in their reed-beds
Green and lush.
Magic, more than dream bequeaths one.
There I found;
Such a stillness, such a strangeness
Dwelt around.
Musing lone, feet sunk in bracken
Washed by dew,
What the scene meant, what the hour held,
Nought I knew.
Nought I knew till something whispered,
Whispered near,
“I am Silence, ancient Silence:
Dost thou hear?
“Hear and know with mind undreaming.
Full awake—
I, the echoless, lone wander
By this lake.”

Human Rust- -primary
cause of 95°/o of
present-day sickness”
. . . explains Consulting Physician
of Buda Pesfh
Dr. EMIL LEVAI
T UST as rust coats a water pipe, so
through faulty bowel action fragments
of food waste become encrusted on the
walls of the intestine. This waste matter is
“human rust.” In it breed germs and
poisons which enter the blood stream, leading
to dreaded self-poisoning (autoxima). Self-
poisoning, the result of “human rust,” is
responsible for most of the ill-health which
afflicts modern men and women.
Clear out “Human Rust” With
Coloseptic
You can clear from your system the virulent
poisons that undermine health and sap
vitality. You can banish constipation, head-
ache, gas in the bowels and stomach, catarrh,
backache, rheumatism, neuritis, and all the
hosts of ailments that come from self-poison-
ing Take COLOSEPTIC. It first loosens
and dissolves, then smoothly washes out the
decaying waste. It rids the body of all
poisons and blood impurities through
Nature’s four outlets —the large intestine —
the kidneys—-the pores of the skin —and the
respiratory organs.
Regain Your Youthful Vigour
Every morning take COLOSEPTIC
in hot water. COLOSEPTIC actually
“tones” and cleanses your entire digestive
tract—helps your body throw off its waste
matter regularly. No longer are you
depressed, tired without cause, subject to
headaches and colds. Your pulse leaps to
the thrills of life —your old vim and vigour
return. Aches, pains, and ailments vanish
for ever.

LAND OF HOPE AND GLORY.
“The photos, and descriptions of America’s

will also be • displayed in newspapers and on
cinema screens,”—' “Sun” cable.
“I might consider it,” mused the Syd-
ney society girl.
“What the blazes are you muttering
about?”
The radiant creature ignored the sple-
netic baldhead on the other side of the
breakfast-table. -
“Of course the ‘Teleglub’ women’s
section is all right, in its way,” she con-
tinued. “But how many read the dam’
thing?”
She suddenly condescended to address
her father.
“Ever hear of Mrs. Jimmy Limechaser,
the popular Younger Set matron ; that
conspicuous figure at Gigolo’s supper-
dances ; that tower of strength to the
fashionable St. Gloom’s Charity Ball
movement”
“!!!!??”
“Igg-sackly. You’ve never heard of
her. An’ she gets more press boosts than
any publicity-monger in the city! That
settles it. How do I learn kidnapping,
dad?”
“Have you taken leave
of your senses, girl?”

they’re giving American

THE LOST GUFF-BOOBLE.
Trustees Again at Fault.
Sir,—Mr. S. Ure Smith, while in Eng-
land, visited an exhibition of the Sur-
realists. I quote from his remarks in the
“Sun”: —
“In one picture there were ruled lines, a leaf
torn from a book, more ruled lines, and a space
which apparently remained was covered with
used pink blotting-paper. The price on it was
25 guineas.”
And he omitted to acquire the lovely
thing for Australia! Our official art
authorities (forsooth!), the trustees of the
so-called National Art Gallery of N. S.
Wales (ha! ha!), have here let slip
through their recreant fingers a vital
example of English contemporary art at
its best—to wit, Horace Guff-Booble’s
“Corkless.”
The name derives from the fact that it
is the only work by this Master which
hasn’t a cork stuck on it. In “Corked”
we have the ruled lines, the leaf, the
blotting-paper and a cork gummed to the
top left-hand corner—the whole provid-
ing a vital study of an aged lunatic under
the influence of drink.
In “Corking!” the usual treatment is
employed (except that the Master seems
to have forgotten to rule one or two of
his lines), but the cork is now in the
south-east corner of the painting, thus
providing those who possess the modern-
istic key with a portrait of a delighted
schoolboy—the kind of thing Rembrandt
A CORKER!
OR
THE BEACH BELLE.
( Modernism’s Answer to "La Gioconda.”)
might have done if he had had a chance
to eliminate his faults by studying in
Bloomsbury.
“A Corker!” (reproduced), which has
the cork gummed to the middle of the
used pink blotting-paper, depicts, for
those in the know, a singularly winsome
flapper ; while “Uncorked,” in which the
cork is found above one of the ruled
lines, reveals with singular grace the re-
actions of a fashionable dinner-party to a
suddenly-opened bottle of asafoetida—
the prank of a second footman under
notice of dismissal.
But why continue the tragic story?
There is no Guff-Booble in the Sydney
Gallery, nor will there ever be while the
present trustees (bah!) rule the roost.
And Sydney might have earned the dis-
tinction of being the onlv public gallery
in the world to exhibit a Guff-Booble, the
works of this Master having been re-
jected elsewhere in favor of stodge by
Rubens, Velasquez, and the like. The
pity of it! —Yours etc.,

a backless bather when interviewed.
“A great idea,” he exclaimed, stumbling
over a pair of tennis shorts. “Our firm is
wholeheartedly in favor of this scheme,
and will donate a pair of cellophane
scanties to the bather who figures in most
prosecutions for the infringement of
beach regulations this season.”
The Film Censor was reading “Han-

“0.K.,” he boomed ; “I’m with you all

SPORTING
MOTIONS
Under the Whip
Although he won a Doncaster the
Magpie gelding Jacko has proved him-
self slicker at six furlongs than eight.
His victory in the, Carrington Stakes at
Randwick was a very fine achievement.
Last at the half-mile, second-last into the
straight, he came so fast that he had
the race in hand entering on the last fur-
long ; time, lmin. Ilf sec. Jacko must
have run a sensational three furlongs. All
going well he will be set for the New-
market ; he ran second to Waltzing Lily
last year.
Vista was unfortunate in bumping
Jacko at his best; third was Chemosh,
who seems to be worth following by tote
punters at Randwick. Tom Pinch was
the great disappointment. The support
for him caused Jacko to go out at 2 to 1.
Tom had the run of the race, but failed
badly over the last furlong. Dole showed
his customary brilliancy, and ought to be
at his top in the Challenge Stakes.
Losing races on protests is nothing new
for trainer Booth. His party put in
heavily on Constantine in the Juvenile,
but a protest by Sylvandale’s rider, Britt,
for interference in the last furlong was
upheld. Sylvandale started at 5 to 1 ;
he is raced by “Miss Lorna Doone,” and
cost 550 guineas as a yearling, though
knocked down at 225. It was a disputed
bid. and Clive Inglis, who bought the

colt for the lady, was forced to go higher.
Sylvandale is a brother to Trenette and
Joan of Arc.
Newcastle-owned and -trained Prince’s
Promise (6 to 1) won the Novice in a
manner that suggested further successes.
He was set a rather severe task by Darby
Munro, who rode him hard from barrier-
rise to judge’s box. That he was able to
stall off Diamond and Chiefava says
much for his stamina. The well-backed
Frescade is not of much account, and
despite Salted Almond’s good track trials
with High he beat only a couple home.
The unreliable Alleviate (10 to 1) was
much too good for the opposition in
the first division of the Maiden. He
came home well to beat Mainlaw and
the favorite, Lingo. Trainer Peter Riddle
did not back him, but the owner, R.
Byers, took a small wager about the
Legionnaire gelding. Muswellbrook pas-
toralist Hunter Bowman sent out Sun
Motor in capital trim for the second
division. Starting at 14 to 1, the stable-
mate of Serabite and Side Car got there
by a head from Spotlight, with Frassadale
a close third. The winner was piloted by
Parr, who is apprenticed to Kelso and
won the Summer Cup for the boss on
Nord (8 to 1).
Clever Fox (8 to 1) was a good winner
for the bookies in the Pace Welter. Tin-
galba and Aussie’s Delight were heavily
backed; they met with interference ai
barrier rise. Lionhearted essayed to lead
all the way, and battled on well to get
second place ahead of the improving
Prismatic—still trained by the Victorian
Fred Foulsham, who was not present.
Agincourt (8 to 1) wound up a good
day for the fielders by annexing the
Denman Handicap from Cynical and the
favorite, Satmoth ; the mare is owned by
pastoralist J. J. Leahy, and is trained at
Rosehill by Webster, who has been
highly successful with Akuna, Balgay
and Tangible. Wailes rode her in capital
style, the lad showing much confidence
despite O’Sullivan’s effort on Cynical in
the last furlong.
In Tatt.’s Club Cup on Monday, Darby
Munro, who has had a wonderful
Christmas and New Year, tried the ex-
periment of taking Satmoth to the front.
It answered admirably, for the Satelles
gelding was never passed ; he wound up
three lengths ahead of unlucky Mince
Pie, with Gippsland a fast-finishing third.
Milantheon chased Satmoth most of the
way, but blew out. The time was 2min.

and in her first season at the stud pro-
duced a good galloper in Meadow Lea,
whose full brother, Melason, is one of
the fastest sprinters in Melbourne. His
third at Caulfield on Boxing Day, in the
race won by Spartan, showed that
Cazique had inherited the family pace,
but on Saturday he began slowly and
was never really in the hunt. Success
went to Skidmore’s mount, Flower of
Egypt, who registered her third succes-
sive victory.
Flower of Egypt is a beautifully-built
daughter of Manfred, and promises to
develop into a veritable flying machine
on the turf. She handled 9st. in great
style, and stalled off a challenge from
Triteleia, a filly by Great Star from
imported Mauve, whose half-brother,
Polycletan, won the 1924 Metropolitan.
Starting at 50 to 1, Holden ran a
moderate third to Flower of Egypt and
Triteleia. He is another of the Manfreds.
So far Heroic has outstripped Manfred
on the list of winning stallions, but the
disparity may not be so pronounced in
the present year of grace.
The second division of the youngsters’
event was captured by Game Chick, a
Whittier filly. Both Manfred and Whit-
tier are in Aldridge’s Kismet stud. Game
Chick went out at even money and
scored comfortably from the second
favorite, Charles Fox, owned and trained
by D. J. Price. Lack of racing experi-
ence hampered Charles Fox, but he will
make good. Sol Green imported Bril-
liance and mated her with Son o’ Mine in
1931, Charles Fox, a stoutly-built colt,
being the result.
Harry Freedman, who rode over fences
for Septimus and Albert Miller, of Red-
leap fame, had a successful time as
trainer. He annexed the Mentone Plate
with Stardom and the first division of
the Mentone Purse with Eglonite, be-
sides finishing second with both Triteleia
and Star Sapphire. After a tight tussle
Stardom defeated the 5-to-4 favorite,
Great Night, by a head. It looked as if
Sharpe took things a trifle easy when he
hit the front on Great Night, but Star-
dom generally comes home strongly in
his races. The outing will be beneficial
to Great Night; he is the only grey
horse that The Night Patrol has sired, the
color being inherited by his dam, Sweet
Innocence, a daughter of Roi Herode.
Fred Hovsted was hopeful of pulling
off the Trial Handicap with Big Wonder.
This gelding claims Windbag as sire, but
is a washy-looking chestnut, the color
being derived from the dam, Pukkinya,
by Wallace. Though he had pace enough
to cut down the pacemaker, Practice, as
soon as heads turned for home, Big
Wonder fought feebly when challenged,
and faded out of a place. Beaconstteld
won in good style from Seabrae and
Gold Chick ; he is a comparatively recent
importation from M.L. On two or three
occasions Beaconsfield disappointed Jim
Pengilly, his trainer, who allowed him to
go out at 8 to 1 on Saturday.
Frank Dempsey has lost none of the
skill that enabled him to win so many
races for Jack Holt in years gone by, but
of late he has been rather in the back-
ground as a jockey. The little man
cleverly piloted Amazon Queen to vic-
tory in the second division of the Purse.
Lou Robertson and his followers put a
packet of money on Wallopian. They
were mortified to see Amazon Queen
vanquish the supposed good thing by
half a head. Tammit, trained by a
nephew of Bob Lewis, was the medium of
a big betting coup in the Jumpers’ Flat
Race. Backed down to 10 to 9, Tammit
romped home. Lewis has severed an
association of 40 years with James Scobie,
and handed in the colors of Ernest
Clarke, but he has not definitely retired
yet.

“Ike Mcßagg”: The public at Port
Adelaide’s Christmas meeting was agree-
ably entertained by the first appearance
of open bookmaking on a South Austra-
lian course for 40 years. There were
plenty of the boys in all the enclosures.
One thing noticeable was that many called
the odds in comparatively hushed tones
compared with their fellows at Fleming-
ton and Randwick. The poor fellows
have got so used to laying ’em under-the-
lap—in a whisper round corners and in
pub bars—that they have lost the art of
il bello canto, as the music sharps have it.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Australian wrestlers have been getting
more opportunities at Leichhardt, but the
crowds prefer foreigners. Dick Cameron
didn’t lose much by not turning
up to defend his title
against Jim Deakin —“injured foot” was
the explanation —so Keatos (real name,
Ellis, or something like that) took his
place. Deakin did all the wrestling;
Keatos supplied the showmanship. Latter
was disqualified for refusing to obey the
referee. Bert Ryding stopped Young
Ghandi —who doesn’t wear a loincloth
and has a full set of teeth —in the eighth
round of a mill for their championship —
the paperweight.
Ins and Outs
Cricket followers ill-advised enough to
waste a perfect day at Sydney Cricket
Ground on Saturday beheld one of the
most appalling exhibitions of inept bat-
ting, feeble bowling and indifferent field-
ing which have ever disfigured the vener-
able arena. The funeral lay between
Queensland and N.S.W., the latter with-
out O’Reilly and McCabe. Queensland
batted on a perfect wicket, and, in spite
of being given every opportunity of mak-
ing a mammoth score, pottered through
the long, long day to stumps, when six
of them were out for 254. Thompson, a
couple of years or so ago a fine, forcing
batsman, slumbered on the creases for
240 minutes, by which time 92 runs had
accumulated opposite his name. Then he
was mercifully stumped. Levy (45) and
Andrews (38) were the only batsmen to
shape like cricketers, though Allen (32
n. 0.) sometimes showed a tendency to
give the ball a good, hard knock. Oxen-
ham was with Allen when night brought
surcease to the few remaining spectators.
On the Monday Queensland made a
better showing, and the last wicket lei
for 372: Allen, 86 ; Oxenham, 51 N.S.W.
had one down for 100 (Brown 50) on
Monday afternoon,
* * * *
The Sheffield game between Victoria
and South Australia at Melbourne pro-
vided some bright and lively cricket
South Australia made a good start with
313. The chief contributor was the
diminutive Lonergan, with a rattling 115,
after Richardson (28) and Nitschke (33)
had taken the edge off the bowling. Most
of the others helped with useful scores,
the largest of which was Grimmett’s 30.
Fleetwood-Smith repeated his success
against N.S.W., his tally this time being
8-111, which suggests he has found the
consistency he has been seeking so long.
Victoria came back well, and on Satur-
day at stumps had 291 up with seven
wickets down. A sound 94 by Ponstord
and a fast and attractive 101 n.o. by
Bromley were the chief items. Bromley s
dashing showing was welcomed by every-
one —it is the ex-Westralian’s first cen-
tury in Sheffield cricket. Wall bowled
with great heart to take 4 for 51. Brom-
ley carried his score to 161 on Monday,
the innings closing at 366. S. Aus. be-
gan badly—3 for 25.
* * * *
“Wind-up” : Ma tackles South Australia
in Sydney this week-end and South Aus-
tralia faces Queensland in Brisbane, be-
ginning January 12. But the high tension
meeting of them all should be the clash
between N.S.W. and Vic. in Sydney, be-
ginning January 26—Anniversary Day.
Immediately that is over the sheep for
England will be separated from the goats
to stay behind by the Australian selectors.
* * * *
“Hotham”: The storied past yielded
up some of its spectres in Melbourne last
week when two teams of veterans, led
by Ransford and Noble, clashed at the
Albert ground Armstrong couldn’t play,
but others of the giants of old were
Ryder, Carlton, Carkeek and Mathews.
It was an interesting item that Carkeek
kept to Mathews in this match, just as
he did when the Victorian bowler put up
the unique record performance of the
hat trick twice in the one Test match.
That was against South Africa in 1912,
during the “triangular tournament” in
England.
(Continued on next page.)
Racquet and Bawl
As expected, the English tennis players
showed improved form in the third
Test with Australia on the opening day
at Melbourne. The sides cut level as far
as the rubbers went, each winning two,
though the home side was seven up on
the games. Hopman started the singles
well by beating Wilde 6-1, 6-3. McGrath
followed suit by losing only one game
in two sets to Lee. England’s turn came
when G. P. Hughes triumphed over Turn-
bull by 6-4, 6-1. Australia started^
favorite for the doubles event. Perry and '
Lee, however, playing great tennis, proved
too solid for the Quist-Hopman combina-
tion, winning 7-5, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2. On Mon-
day the visitors fell away again:
Hopman defeated Hughes (6-3, 6-1),
and McGrath again downed Perry (7-5,
6-4); Quist also beat Lee.
(Continued on next page.)
The Rugby League Kangaroos played
three matches last week-end. They had
a good win against Hull club by 19-5.
The propaganda match against “Wales”
at Wembley was a dismal flop. Fewer
than 10,000 spectators went to the vast
London stadium to see the match. The
tourists ran away from the pick-up
opposition, winning 51-19. Another mis-
sionary effort in Paris between the Aus-
tralians and a North of England team
was also a washout in point of attend-
ance. The Australians again scored a
victory. A couple more matches in Eng-
land will end the tour.

Ins and Outs
.t The Christmas Sheffield Shield matches
in Adelaide and Melbourne were respon-
sible for cricket which was attractive in
spots and infernally dreary for long
periods. Queensland’s good rally against
South Australia in the second innings was
nullified by failure in the first, and South
Australia won outright by eight wickets,
losing Nitschke and Lonergan for the 94
required.
In Melbourne, facing Victoria’s good
first-innings start of 382, N.S.W. batsmen
practically collapsed until Bradman came
along. He took command of the bowl-
ing and finished 187 n.o. in Ma’s total
of 355. Fleetwood-Smith bagged 7 for 138.
Devastating bowling by O’Reilly (9-50)
routed Victoria for 200, Darling (53) bat-
ting well. Ponsford’s 40 was a dreary
performance, and O’Brien took over three
hours to make 29. N.S.W. wanted 228
to win, and for a while it looked as
if Bradman (77 n. 0.) would get them with
another masterly exhibition of forcing
cricket. Time was too short, however,
and stumps were drawn with Ma’s score
144 for one wicket (Kippax, 28). Rowe
was the other n.o. batsman, with 39.
Victoria now leads with 14 points.
South Australia has 10, and N. S. Wales
6 only. Queensland, with 3, is threatened
again with the wooden spoon.
* * * *
“Aigburth”: Curious how the anti-
Bradman complex has been leading some
British journals to insinuations that are
in the worst taste. Bradman has been
“T'h' flamin’ fish don’t seem ter be ’ungry.”
“Wot about tryin’ if they’re thirsty ? We got plenty o’ bait.”
attacked as an alleged mercenary, and
now comes a charge that he has delivered
an ultimatum that, unless his wife is
allowed to accompany him on the next
tour of England, in contravention of a
long-standing rule of the board, he will
not go himself. One could understand
that sort of stuff from the million-circu-
lation sewer press of London, but even
the “Daily Telegraph” publishes the story.
* * * *
“Old Q.”: lam uplifted over the vic-
tory of the Queensland “colts,” several
of whom have played in the first eleven
of their State, against their N.S.W. oppo-
site numbers, a fair proportion of whom
has also figured among Kippax’s men.
The Bananalanders won their game in
Sydney by five wickets. What is more
important is that, while none of Ma’s lads
set the pond at Randwick on fire, three
at least of the visitors—all genuine
youngsters—did something in that way.
The trio are Wyeth, a country bowler,
who took 6 for 48 in Ma’s first knock of
246 ; Govan, the Brisbane Grammar boy,
whose figures were 5 for 53 in the
second; and the 16-year-old ’keeper
Tallon, who, besides taking two wickets
for 9 extras, had the audacity to make
69 n.o. in splendid style in a little over
50 minutes. This, of course, will put him
in bad with the batsmen’s union, but his
youth may be taken into consideration
It is late to suggest that the touring
Queensland first eleven stand down in
favor of the “colts,” but I put the idea
forward.
“Methuselah”: Recent successes of
Grimmett and Oxenham remind me that
some of the old dogs are still useful for
a hard road. Many following cricket
closely are ignorant of the fact that these
two are the only men now playing Shef-
field cricket who have made over 1000
runs and taken over 100 wickets. Grim-
mett, after the S.A.-Q. match, had taken
307 wickets at an average of 26 and a
fraction. Batting, he had made 1501 runs,
with a highest of 71 n.o. and an average
slightly over 22. Oxenham had taken
118 wickets for an average of 19 runs
apiece. With the bat his tally was 1698
runs and a 32 average, with a highest
of 162 n.o.
Racquet and Bawl
“Top Spin”: There is an old proverb
about riding a willing horse to death,
and those responsible for tournament
tennis in Australia carry it into practice
with annoying frequency. After his gruel-
ling time in the Queensland champion-
ships and the second Test young Karl
Quist was dragged to Sydney within 36
hours to play exhibition matches at a tin-
pot local tournament. McGrath and Craw-
ford were driven to death in the same
way for a year or more before they were
selected as Davis Cup reps. The doctors
have ordered Crawford off the court for
a bit, and, as far as these money-catching
exhibitions go, the same course should
be taken with Quist and McGrath if we
don’t want to see both crocked before
they are of age.
* * * *
“Cut Shot”: There is a chance that
the advertisement Jardine gave Austra-
lian barracking may get an addendum
from Perry and co. In Brisbane the
other day the distinguished visitors were
visibly shocked when the spectators
opened out with some carefree remarks,
directed at the umpires. One or two of the
officials made the mistake of calling their
compatriots to attention for harmless
comment during the rallies. The result
was that criticism of a more drastic kind
was handed to themselves. As in the
Jardine case, the fault lay originally with
the tactlessness of the criticised. A little
judicious silence on these occasions
silences outbursts which open opposition
only inflames.
* * * *
“Cottesloe”: The Westralian team
which is touring India at the invitation
of the Indian L.T.A. has proved rather
a flop in the big tournament at Calcutta,
where all the-best players in Hind had
congregated. R. D. Ford went down to
Madan Mohan, the Cambridge Blue,
while W. F. Stephen was beaten by a
former champion of India, D. N. Kapur.
Ford’s failure will disappoint the
Gropers. He is rated as the State’s best
player.
* * * *
Rushy’s”: There should be something
doing in the Australian tennis champion-
ships in Sydney at the end of this month.
The Englishmen will have finished the
third Test with Australia at Melbourne
and should be thoroughly acclimatised
and at the top of their game. They may
need it, for the opposition will be a
tough one. In addition to Crawford
after his spell, Malfroy, the M.L. player
who downed Perry in their meeting in
the Shivery Isles, Moon, of Queensland,
always at his best at these big meetings,
where he gets a chance of some first-
class practice, and the best of Australian
players outside our Davis Cup men will
have to be tackled by the Englishmen.
Vines got away with the last singles title.
Perry will have a stiffer fight to collect
it, as he desires to do this time.
* * * *
“Centre Court”: Ex-Australian Stanley
Doust, now an acknowledged tennis
authority in England, won’t have it that
Australian success in the first two Tests
forecasts a Davis Cup win next year. He
blames the Brisbane heat for England’s
loss in the second match at Brisbane,
though he knows that summer condi-
tions can be as bad in any of the other
mainland capitals. Another point he ad-
vances is that the Australian champion-
ships with their five-set matches will give
the Englishmen a better chance than they
enjoy in the three-set Test games. If that
is so, the visitors have only themselves to
blame. They insisted on the three sets
and the locals gave way to them.
* * * *
“Susie Swattit”: Ever notice how
women tennis champions run to matri-
mony? In the 1880’s England had Mrs.
Hillyard and Mrs. Sterry, and these
were followed by Mrs. Lambert Cham-
bers and Mrs. Larcombe. Mrs. Fearley-
Whittingstall is an English star to-day,
while America boasts Mrs. Mallory and
Mrs. Wills-Moody, the latter still the best
of them all. Mdme. Rene Mathieu is
France’s pride. Australia can produce
Mrs. O’Hara Wood, Mrs. Ford, Mrs.
Harper, Mrs. Molesworth and Mrs.
Westmacott, to pipe off only a few.
Many of the single championettes mar-
ried in due course, but those named
are about the only ones who carried on
with big tennis after swearing to love,
honor and obey some person they could
belt off a tennis court at any time of
asking.
* * * *
Iconoclast”: Once upon a time there
was a tendency to rate a male tennis
player as a bit of a sissy, and the im-
pression still lingers. Recent news from
Europe will not remove it. It seems that
a breach occurred last year between
Austin and Borotra, and “heated expres-
sions were exchanged.” The pair de-
clined to meet thereafter, but now that
is all over. Borotra has entered for a
Pans tourney on the condition that
Austin will also, so in the tennis world
it is taken that they will kiss and be
friends as of yore. One cannot imagine
such a happening cropping up in foot-
ball or cricket, or even in professional
wrestling.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Hamilton”: Queensland has been
clamoring for some time for Australian
championship meetings, and has invited
the Australian golfing heads to send up
someone to inspect the leading courses.
It was arranged that Ivo Whitton would
at them; now the A.G.U. says it can’t
send anyone until after its annual meeting
next October. That means the Banana-
landers have been fobbed off for the best
part of another year, and they are going
very sour about it.
* * * *
“Old South”: An American exchange
is responsible for this tall golf yarn. Play-
ing in a long-driving competition at Pine-
hurst, North Carolina, three competitors
named Nailes, Hammer and Sledge
finished in the first three places. The
happening—or the story—may be ac-
counted for by the fact that N.C. is one
of the few States which voted against the
repeal of prohibition and consequently
still serves bootleg whisky at its nine-
teenth holes, where yarns of this kind
invariably originate.
* * * *
“R.M.”: Vic. golfers are proud of J.
M. Ross, who, though he is 78, can travel
with the best of the young ’uns, and re-
cently astonished everyone by returning a
card of 77. There is no doubt about this
feat, but some similar ones recall the yarn
about the man who got into a deep
bunker. His opponent waited some dis-
tance away until he hacked his way out,
and then asked how many strokes he had
taken. “Six,” lied the first man valiantly.
“Well,” was the reply, “I thought I
counted 12 by the sound.” “That’s where
you slipped,” retorted the bunkered one.
“You must have counted in the echoes.”
* * * *
“Gregory Terrace”: Brisbane’s muni-
cipal golf course has not yet returned a
profit, the balance sheet for the second
year of existence showing the expenses
£703 ahead of revenue, which totalled
£2377. Considering that the course has
turned what was an arid and stony park
into one of the most attractive features
of the city, the venture has been well
justified, and, as work on course improve-
ment and maintenance grows less, profit
will begin to show.: Moore Park in Syd-
ney took a longish time to get ahead of
things. One of its hurdles, however, was
the tendency of Labor City Councils to
put on hordes of out-of-works to trim
the fairways with nail-scissors and similar
implements at the basic wage.
* * * *
“Mug Golfer”: There is an agitation
in Queensland for the establishment of a
close championship of the State —that is,
one confined to players within a pre-
scribed area. Several of the other
States boast these meetings, notably
N.S.W., and they are common elsewhere,
though by no means universal. Many
club golfers who are not in the cham-
pionship class and never will be, but like
to have a little use of the courses to the
upkeep of which they contribute, consider
Bananaland high-lights of the game get
quite enough chances of shining brightly
in big tournaments as it is without block-
ing up one course or another at all
seasons of the year with additional special
shows for themselves.
* * *
“Charnock”: Not much is known of
Indian golf at this end of the world, but
the final of the amateur championship of
Hind at Calcutta last week was unusually
interesting. The winner, H. Graham,
headed his opponent, H. Byrkmire, in the
36-hole final by the staggering margin
of 10 up and 9 to play. Though similar
runaways are occasionally chronicled in
minor golf, this is almost unparalleled in
a first-class championship match.
* H= *
“Carnoustie”: British international
golf heads are setting their house in order
against the coming season. The Walker
Cup match between amateur teams repre-
senting America and Britain is set down
for St. Andrews on May 11 and 12. The
amateur championship opens at Prest-
wick, also in Scotland, on May 21, while
Britain will see the fight for the open title
begin at Royal George’s, Sandwich, on
June 23. (Continued on page 26.)

Car and Cycle
“Whizz”: Sydney saw its first motor-
car championship for a long time when
the Dirt Track Car-racing Club staged a
special meeting at Granville Showground.
The racing on the small track provided
plenty of thrills. The title event, the
three-mile, went to A. Tuckett, of Queens-
land, driving a Rajo Ford, second place
being taken by the N.S.W. driver B.
Leckie, in a Ford., Winner s time was
3min. 44 2-ssec.
* * * *
“Transmontane”: To make car records
nowadays it is only necessary to pick a
route no one else has attempted for new
speed figures and get busy. It is cabled
that one Lord de Clifford has just put
up a new record from Dieppe to Brin-
disi, covering the 1638 miles in 44i hours
running time. The average speed was
only 39 m.p.h., but that doesn’t matter,
for if anyone else has ever gone faster
on this run no one has heard about it.
* * * *
“Bunting”: The motor-cycle heads of
Victoria and N.S.W. have come to an
agreement over flag signals. These dif-
fered in the two States, and riders from
one State competing in another often got
mixed. The new flags to be used at the
Grand Prix meeting at Phillip Island on
January 29 are as follows: White, start;
red, stop ; black, individual rider to stop ;
red and black together, all riders to stop :
green, caution ; yellow, last lap ; black-
and-white check, finish. Color-blind
riders will, presumably, have to rely on
watching the other fellow.

“Kick Starter”: The N.S.W. motor-

body to endorse a new record for B-class
cycles claimed by J. Williamson. Riding
a 348-c.c. Norton, Williamson has done a
two-way quarter-mile with a flying start
in 9sec. and 9|sec. respectively, or 97.92
m.p.h.—nearly a mile and a half better
than the standing figures put up last June.
* * * *
“Exhaust”: There seems to be a tangle
as regards the Australian Tourist Trophy
races at Easter. It has been widely an-
nounced that this year’s events would be
held on Phillip Island (Vic.), though it is
not the Cabbage Garden’s turn. Now they
are to be held on the Bathurst (N.S.W.)
circuit, as originally arranged. Bathurst
was particularly anxious to get the meet-
ing, which brings a lot of business to the
town, and it is officially announced that
everything is set. The muddle seems a
curious one for the motor-cycle heads
to have fallen into.

“Sprocket”: Three N.S.W. amateur
cycling championships were decided in

half-mile, though he was disqualified tor
interference with McGregor in a heat. He
was allowed to start in the final “under
protest” and won provisionally in a flat

bridge won the two-mile in 4min. 3sec.
and A. Brazier the junior championship
over a mile in 2min. 7 l-ssec.

“Roller”: Victorian pushbike autho-
rities are considering the matter of an
outstanding road race on the lines of
the Tour de France as their contribu-
tion to the centenary celebrations. There
are lots of problems confronting the
promoters. International riders are ex-
pected to compete, and it is essential that
control and conduct of the affair should
measure up to the standard they are
accustomed to on the Continent unless
this country is to get a bad advertise-
ment. We have no team system here
such as is the outstanding feature of the
Continental races of the kind, and our
best substitute would be inter-State
teams. Like the European events, the
race would be run in stages, and the
Victorians should see to it that the prize-
money is worthy of the occasion.
Miscellaneous
“Stamford Bridge”: The success of the
British Empire Games in London next
August seems assured. Ten countries
already have their entries in: England,
Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Australia,
Canada, India, Newfoundland, Maoriland
and South Africa. Bermuda and British
Guiana are among those expected to
come along. Australia will hear with
regret that rowing and sculling have been
cut out. The excuse is the difficulty of
arranging a suitable course, which seems
a bit thin.
“Worsted”: This week the Australian
British Empire Games Association holds
its meeting in Sydney to straighten out
matters for the show in London, and
decide whether women will be sent. Pro-
bably a compromise will be arrived at
and a couple of swimmers allowed to go.
* * * *
“The Gaffer”: I read that the Christ-
mas season was celebrated at Geelong
jug with sports. What the prizes were is
not stated, but there was an old buffers’
race, presumably for the Kathleen
Mavourneens. It reminds me of “Flour-
bag” Petermain, one of my team in
N.Q. long ago. He got lumbered for
rolling a canecutter at Ayr, and they sent
him to Stewart’s Creek for a sixer. They
kept their own dairy cattle and horses
there, and one day “Flourbag” went out
with a fat warder to round up some cows
with young calves. One cow kept break-
ing back, until the fed-up screw yelled:
“Go your hardest after her, ‘Flourbag’.’
Petermain was so quick out of the holes
and kept the pace so well that they didn’t
get him again till six months after at
Normanton.
“Spiel”: The official invitation to all
nations to take part in the Olympic
Games at Berlin in 1936 has been sent
out, and Hitler has ordered the enlarge-
ment of the stadium to impress visitors
with the might of the new Germany. A
special lake is being dug for the sailing
and rowing races, and the athletic arena
seats 100,000, with a second area to
accommodate 250,000. Tennis enclo-
sures, open-air theatres, gymnasiums and
a medical institute are also provided for.
Four hundred German athletes are
already in training, an example to Aus-
tralia, which, as usual, will begin to
realise there is an Olympiad on some-
where about the beginning of 1936.
* * * *
“Belisarius”: No glory fades so quickly
as that of the athlete. The other day
Andrew Charlton, maker of many records,
returned to Sydney. At one time his
movements were traced hour by hour.
To-day, when his glory has departed and
other champions hold the stage, a curt
par. in journals that once abased them-
selves before him is all he is accorded.
There is a lesson here for heroes of the
gladiatorial arena, not even excluding the
demigod of to-day, Bradman.
* * * *
“C.1.H.”: One or two Australian polo-
players have proved their worth in India,
where the best polo in the world is
played. George Ashton, of the famous
Goulburn (N.S.W.) polo tribe, is the
latest. He turned out at Calcutta last
week in a minor gymkhana which is a
preliminary for the All India champion-
ship with a team calling itself the
Gladiators. The other three were all
officers of the 15th Lancers. With an 11
handicap, the Gladiators beat their oppo-
nents 14-11, and they are now expected
to give the all-conquering Rajput team
led by the Maharajah of Jaipur the go
of their lives in the championship.
* * * *
“Blade”: Bad luck seems to dog all
efforts of N.S.W. rowing men to send a
crew to Maoriland. In the past M.L.
has usually been willing, but for one
reason or another Ma has not been able
to go over. Now, when N.S.W. has every-
thing set, the All Blacks say that owing
to the hard times the Dominion clubs
cannot afford to throw in* so the trip
arranged for must be shelved.
* * * *
“Bodyline”: American university foot-
ball is in the throes of a furious argu-
ment about a practice adopted by
Oregon. This team plays a 6ft. 6in.
giant, and he is always employed to
block kicks at goal. Insult is added to
injury by hoisting him on the shoulders
of another huge team-mate when kicks
are being taken, the result being an
obstacle over 12ft. high in front of the
kicker. American rules offer no help to
protesters. Rugby Union referees. would
probably bring law 34, which deals Wltn
obstruction, into play, using
cretion. *
-je * *
“Rectorv Field”: In addition to Jan
McShane at Oxford, Australian Rug y
players are shining with some of th g
clubs. G’ee, who played for Victor* last
vear is scrum-half with Blackheatft.
Wallaby forward Bland is figuring:
the same team. Stur ridge has turned
out with Rosslyn Park, another noted
London club, and all are earning golden
opinions from the critics. *
“Stand Off”": The N.S.W. Rugby
Union conferred last week with Sta
Dean, who came from M.L. for the pur-
pose, on the subject of again adopting the
Rugby League kick-into-touch rule which
the British International Board has
banned. South Africa is also said to be
inclined the same way, after seeing th
Wallabies in action. The best that can be
hoped for is that the board will permit
the professional rule to be played in the
Dominions. It will certainly never be
countenanced in Britain, and, since both
All Blacks and Australians are booked
for tours there in the near future, visit-
ing sides will have to revert to the old
rule. There is nothing wrong with this
if applied in a sportsmanlike fashion;
it is continual kicking into touch for the
sake of gaining ground that is the
trouble. It is the leg-theory racket over
again. Both are legitimate enough, the
objection to them being in their abuse.
“Banzai’: The Australian R.U. foot-
ballers are promised a riotous time in
Japan if the experience of the Canadian
team is any criterion. The Canucks
sent over the cream of their uni-
versities, but blame the universal hos-
pitality for losing two of their seven
matches, both these against All Japan.
Australian form is probably a lot higher
than Canuck, but the game has grown
tremendously in Nippon since a Jap team
came here some years ago. In some de-
partments those players showed first-class
form, but their inferiority in height told
heavily against them in the line-out, as
their lack of weight did in the rucking. Of
the matches to be played apart from the
All Japan games, that with Waseda Uni.
will be the hardest. Games against Meiji
and Oshisha follow ; then Kanto, a Tokio
team, and, lastly, All Kansai.
* * * *
“Splash”: In an attempt to break Arne
Borg’s Australian record for 500 metres
(545 yards) Australian champion Noel
Ryan swam the distance in 6min. 27sec.,
which, though 1 3-ssec. behind Borgs
figures, beat his own Australian time by
4 4-ssec. Strictly speaking, Borg’s record
should have been wiped off the books
when he turned professional.


A GALLERY OF GOLFERS.
No. 19.
Cruising About Kingston Heath.
In the beginning, Kingston Heath was
known as the Elsternwick G. C. In 1923
the old club bought 127 acres at King-
ston-road, Heatherton, for £4948, and re-
christened itself Kingston Heath.
The course was ready for play in 1925.
It is 6761 yards in length, with a 77 par.
All the holes are constructed so that at
no time do players have to face into the
sun, the general lie of the links being
north and south. It is undulating and
well timbered, while great pains have been
taken with drainage, no fewer than six
miles of agricultural drains having been
laid to a covered main running through
the property.
In 1926 Dr. Mackenzie, world-famous
golf architect, looked over the course
and completed a bunkering scheme which
was adopted. Since then the links have
developed splendidly, and the course is
counted as one of the most sporting in
Australia.
For some time Kingston Heath had
utilised the old Elsternwick clubhouse,
which had flitted with the members to
the new locality. In 1928 a new one was
built which is well worthy of the course
It cost about £BOOO.
Entrance fee is 31 guineas and sub-
scription nine guineas per annum for
members. Associates are let off a lot more
lightly with five and four guineas re-
specfively; There are 300 members and
th a . ss £f lates ’ so the complacent tone of
the club’s annual report when referring
to the balance sheet is understandable.
n f ° f the club ’ s .woes is that its ex-
courts are not more pat-
v?<S£rc by me r bers ’ thou gh they and
cmwn may .P la y on them for half a
crown, morning or afternoon.
Of the many good players who have
figured on the K.H. membership, Mick
Ryan, winner of the Australian open, is
the star turn to date. He is the first
member to take the big title, though he
has won the Victorian amateur.
Two other notable members, though
less distinguished at golf than at cricket,
are the two internationals Dr. Hartkopf
and Vernon Ransford, both nowadays
given over heart and soul to the Royal
and Antient.
First on the Frithian landscape is R.
Harvey, who is in the timber trade. Off
his mark of 20 he takes some putting
down when on his day. Next is Telford-
Smith, once a racquet-wielder of note. He
plays a very good shot off 15 since he has
seen the light, and is among the most
ardent of golfers. In private life, an
engineer.
The beaming chap viewing with de-
light the misfortunes of the man who
follows him is Norman Russell, sports
secretary and leader of the choir at the
19th. He is keen on musical chairs,
according to his chronicler, and when not
busied with these plays good golf off
17. The fourth drawing depicts a minor
tragedy of the club. Tommy Hartigan
is one of the two heroes, the other being
of name and address unknown. Frith’s
drawing reproduces a fight between
Tommy and a magpie. It was a no-
decision one, so let it go at that. He is
a useful golfer with a 13 handicap.
Joe Gaunt, not nearly as implacable as
Frith makes him, is one of the original
members, and is steeped in the Elstern-
wick tradition. He plays golf off the 15
mark, but is also an enthusiastic yachts-
man. “Bo” Havre, whose feelings while
watching the result of his shot one pre-
fers not to describe if his picture is any cri-
terion of them, was once an officer in the
Foreign Legion, so he ought to be used to
shocks. He is nowadays advertising
manager of the “Weekly Times.” He is a
capital entertainer at the 19th with song
or story, and also plays golf off a longish
handicap.
Harvey Picken, of the affable smile
and a style of hairdressing much re-
sembling that of the brother to whom we
shall come directly, was an oarsman of
note before golf called him away from
water and its insipid accompaniments. He
is a printer by profession and plays a
sound game off 16. W. L. Tregaskis is
No. 8. If he is not a “Carnisher” with
that name he ought to be. He is said to
like billiards better than golf, but he is
no mug at the latter if his 10 handicap
fits him. He is a company secretary. M.
H. Bloch is another player with divided
interests. A jutebroker, he is said to wish
he was at the races when he is playing
golf and to pray for the golf links when
he is at the races. He is one of the oldest
members, but his handicap is still 24.
J- T- Picken, referred to in passing
earlier, is president of K.H. He is a great
social leader, radiating hospitality. If he
has a fault, it is a weakness for quoting
from the verses of Bobbie Burns, but that
doesn’t prevent him frotp being a 15-
marker. It is suspected that D. C. Bar-
rington plays golf for the purpose of
showing off his very latest in snappy
motor-cars. His handicap is 22, and for
some mysterious reason his clubmates
refer to him as “The Celluloid King.”
L. F. Saclier, evidently caught in the
act of spotting Frith in the offing and
wishing he hadn’t come out without his
gun, is secretary. He is a cheery soul
as far as any golf-club secretary can be,
and will, no doubt, reap his reward here-
after, as all his kind deserve to do. D. C.
Stewart, manager of Edments stores, is
the platinum blonde presented next in
order. His real role in the club is as
member of the house committee, a job
he fills with enthusiasm and capacity.
J. P. Rogers is a manufacturer. A
pretty warm performer off 16, he likes
nothing better than taking down brother
member Hartkopf for a few balls
weekly. Following him is Doctor Mor-
tensen, who would be a better golfer if
he grew more beef to put into his shots.
As it is, his 11 handicap suggests that he
has quite enough. Then comes C. S.
Bradley, off the links manager of an
electric-sign concern. In golf he has
the reputation of liking a little bit on the
game ; that is, if he has not reformed of
late. John Murray is better known to
his friends as “Malcolm Campbell”
why, is a hidden mystery. Fairly well on
in years he still plays a warm game off
7. Engineering claims him when not
golfing. Eighteenth is H. V. Braddock,
one of the club’s social lights. He is a soft-
goodsman and claims a handicap of 21.
Mrs. Braddock is the hon. secretary of
the associates.
T. M. Bland is director of a timber co,
and is known to intimates as “one of the
Bing Boys.” Just this side of him and
wearing an equally carefree expression
is R. F. Wilkinson, “the other Bing Boy.”
He is a woollen warehouseman. Last on
the drawing is Afton Morcom, one of the
club’s best players, with a 4 handicap.
As assistant secretary to the Centenary
Council he doesn’t get much golf. He is
a former handicapper, but hopes to live
that down.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
THE
STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
BUILDING THE SHEEPYARDS.
“Deeahree”: Good design, suitable
materials and good workmanship are
the three main points. A set design can-
not be laid down, but a few hints may
be handy.
Have three-way drafting; it saves time
and work. Make the check-pens long
and narrow; this way you find it
easier to check mistakes in drafting.
Sheep like to see where they are going;
so build the drafting race so that they
can see straight through to the end of
the check-pen, from the final force-pen.
Pave the drafting race with boards to
stop it cutting up.
Put outlet gates at both ends of the
two outside check-pens, together with
suitable yards to receive drafted sheep.
It is useful to be able to handle two
different mobs in one set of yards.
A gate from the final force-pen direct
to one of the two outside check-pens is
handy when going through ewes for fly.
A long branding race is an asset at
classing time.
Gates which are essentially entrances
should be as wide as possible, while exits,
especially within the smaller pens, should
not be wider than sft.
Don’t forget that sheep work much
better facing uphill.
The drop-rail fence is neat and easy
to erect. It should not be lower than
3ft. 6in. Round posts, Bin. at small end,
split in two and adzed on inside, to ensure
a snug fit for the rails, should be put
2ft. in the ground, each pair 4in. apart.
Straight, sound barked rails, 4in. at small
end, adzed to 4in. at big end, and 9ft. 6in.
long, will last well if the bottom rail 3S
kept 6in. off the ground by a block.
Bore a hole (fin.) through the twin
posts and the top rail for the wire
twitch. See that top rail cannot shift
in any direction.
Provided suitable timber is not scarce,
put posts and rails throughout. The dif-
ferent types of wire-mesh fence will sag
and buckle under hard work.
BEATING THE BLOWFLY.
“Lion”: “Jumbuck’s” rules (B.
29/11/’33) are excellent in theory, but
utterly impossible in practice on a big
run because: —
(1) Flies give most trouble in the hot weather,
when everything is like tinder. How can one
burn them, even if allowed to do so. Carry-
ing a central incinerator is impracticable, especi-
ally since sheep are often half-rotten when
fo (2) d '(a) Plain-bodied sheep are good for fat-
lamb breeding, but do not carry nearly as much
wool as the wrinkly ones. (6) Some runs
would have to cull their best breeding ewes to
follow this rule. . ~ i ,
(31 This year the fly attack is especially bad,
around Young (N.S.W.) anyhow; the green
fly in particular gives the most trouble. Sh~
burrows in the wool and lays live maggots
which immediately get to work. The hospita
paddock would be overstocked in a week, and,
besides, one’s mobs would all be hopelessly
bo (4) d Blowfly traps catch flies all right, but
again they would cost a small fortune to instal
and look after on a big run.
Carcasses can be dealt with as follows.
(a) Either bury outright, which takes some
doing in hard ground, but which of course
ends the fly-breeding in the body, (b) Cove
with hessian (without holes), laying soil around
the edges to prevent flies crawling underneath.
Even this fails at times.
The best way to deal with the sheep
themselves is:
(a) Continuous attention in paddocks and
careful mustering, as struck sheep often get
away alone and lie behind logs, etc. v&) App >
| good, reliable fly-dressing, one which kills
all maggots, fetches them out of the wool,
heals the wound and acts as a Sudi
a dressing is on the market. I have used it
for years, (c) As “Jumbuck” says, crutch or
jet, but preferably crutch, as this cleans dags
away as well, and is a more payable proposi-
tion; With jetting, dags remain and discolor
and stain the wool, with consequent loss of
value. ,
These “rules” have always proved the
only method to adopt with success as
far as I am concerned, though other
graziers may know of better ones.
This year the fly is striking on the
shoulders and flanks of Wethers and in
the belly wool, and neither crutchmg
nor jetting would help in these cases.
AGE MARKS.
“Delabru”: “Murrawong” and others,
writing of age marks for sheep, forget
that the design and position of the regis-
tered mark has a good deal of bearing
on your cycle of age marks. Any cycle
consisting of four marks and a plain ear
—providing for five years will fill the
bill, provided they are easily distinguish-
able, both in design and position, from
the registered mark and also from one
another. To have your age mark to)
any one year too much like the legis-
tered mark is apt to cause endless trouble
in checking when drafting the sexes.
A FARMER’S SEPTIC TANK.
“Pick”: A septic tank suitable where
less than a dozen people are provided
for is simply constructed and inexpensive.
Septic tanks are nothing more than
long, watertight underground cisterns,
through which sewerage passes slowly
and evenly. Warm and dark from their
location underground, they breed bac-
teria that render the sewerage harmless.
The walls of concrete —2 parts sand, 4
parts clean gravel, to 1 part of cement—
are Bin. thick. The tank is sft. deep and
wide and 10ft. long, inside measurements.
A forme of wooden planks is made
in which to set the concrete. About
2ft. 6in. below the ground surface are
the inlet and outlet pipes on a level. The
pipes have elbow bends immediately m-
side the tank to assist in breaking up the
current and excluding the air.
At distances of 2ft. and 4ft. from
the inlet wall baffle boards are fastened
which extend across the tank and to
within a foot of the bottom. Their func-
tion is to prevent the bacteria from being
violently disturbed by sudden rushes of
water. .
For ventilation there is a manhole
above. Four short lengths of lin.
piping lead through the lid, and a
of bent iron is attached to it for lifting
purposes.
TANNING ON THE FARM.
“Beefo”: Soak the freshly-skinned hide
—white-haired for preference—in clean
water for four hours, run off the dirty
water and cover with clean water, leav-
ing for 24 hours. Dry hides will need
longer soaking. Next soak the hide m
a lime-and-water liquor, in the propor-
tion of lib. lime to every 3gals. water.
Turn and handle it each day for a week ;
then the hair will be easily removed.
Scrape off any flesh or fat when the hide
is removed, and wash well in several lots
of clean water.
To tan, use a liquor of 51b. alum, Wlb.
salt, Hlb. Glauber salt and lOgals. of
water, seeing that the hide is well covered.
Handle it two or three times a day for
a week ; hang it in the shade to drain,
and, without washing, coyer both sides
with whale or neatsfoot oil. When dry,
stretch until soft, but, if too hard to
stretch, spray both sides with water and
cover up for a couple of days.
After being stretched, the leather can
be nailed out on a wall. Instead of oil,
a paste can be used for covering each
side before stretching. For the paste,
mix 2\\b. alum with lgal. of water to
which lib. of salt has been added In
another container, mix 51b. flour and lib.
neatsfoot oil. Stir in enough of the alum-
and-salt liquor to form a paste, and
rub the latter well into both sides of the
hide. After thorough rubbing in, hang
the leather up to dry, stretching and nail-
ing it out before it becomes too stiff.
Stout hides that are too hard to stretch
well can have unsalted fat rubbed m
during stretching.
THE INDIAN HORSE TRADE.
“The Breaker”: “FY7” (B. 29/11/’33),
referring to the scarcity of horses for
the Indian market and to a sale at which
S Margrett found two only out of a yard-
ing of 1700 fit for his money, says “sons
and daughters of Windbag, Heroic, Spear-
felt, etc., will steadily make a difference.
They won’t, unless the mares are avail-
able to produce again the old-time types
of Walers. A good class of mare will
throw a decent sort of a foal to almost
any sire, but the best sire in the world
will never get anything except a waster
if put to a nondescript mare. The falling
off in the supply of good types suitable
for the Indian trade came with the in-
troduction of the Suffolk Punch into
station horse herds. The idea was to
produce dual-purpose animals suitable
for farm work. Tractors killed the
demand for these sorts, and, with a slack-
ened demand for all classes of horses
except the best, breeders let the industry
Sll We have the sires and limited numbers
of good mares, but there is little hope of
India taking all her requirements from
Australia, as formerly she almost did,
until all nondescript mares at present run-
ning on many stations are destroyed.
SADDLE AND HARNESS GALLS.
“Marsh”: Some horses have skins sus-
ceptible to galls, and it is difficult to keep
them free from chafes. These types of
horses are not worth keeping. Dry and
sweaty saddle cloths are certain to cause
sore backs, as also will grit or dirt in the
hair. To minimise the risk, saddle cloths
should be washed every night during the
summer months, and the horse brushed
down before saddling in the morning.
Removal of the cause is the first step
in treatment, and if the horse can be
spelled so much the better, and the
more chance of getting free of trouble.
With a horse in work, apply (three times
a day), as a lotion, a drachm. of burnt
alum and a drachm of sulphuric acid in
a pint of water, when the animal is hot.
Allow it to dry on. If the gall or sore
is deep through neglect, turn the animal
out washing first with warm water to
which a few grains of Condy’s crystals
have been added, and, when dry, coat the
sore with Stockholm tar.
A FARM SLIDE.
“Wrash”: To make a farm slide, chop
out 12in. by 2in. side runners, sft. long,
with upward-curved fore-ends. Shoe
them with lengths of old cartwheel tyres.
Mortise centrally and endwise, and
between fit 4in. by 2in. crossbars, well
shouldered and nailed. Diagonally below,
and mitred to the runners, fit a stout
brace bolted to the crossbars for trame
rigidity. . ,
Tenon the crossbars an inch under
the upper edge of the side runners, and
floor with 4in. by lin. hardwood. Set
ringbolts in front on which to hang the
drawing chains, and auger holes in the
sides for the tie ropes. Loads of hay or
pumpkins, bags of wheat or potatoes,
can be drawn in from the paddocks with
such a sled without the heavy lifting
needed when a dray is in use.
A TRAP FOR INSECTS.
“Hortus”: Reckon we should try a
dodge which gives the French clean crops,
especially in the south. Insect pests
Xch come up from the coast £ Afnca
in clouds are caught m great
an immense suction plant. By
of bright lights the pests are attracted to a
snot where everything for 20 feet round
if caught by the outfit and drawn into a
death Chamber. The contrivance works
round the orchards and vineyards an
crop headlands till early .morning, and
as much as two tons of msect life has
been accounted for in one nigh,
is ruination left alive can Re turned
into good use dead. One of the best
poultry spices on the market is COI T"
posed wholly of dried insect life—the
natural diet of the chook.
Toll of crops and grass in Australia
from insects and grubs is
and this gadget would be less costly
than sprays and traps Lined np a ong
the face of a hopper plague that denudes
the interior pastoral lands at times, it
would check an advance otherwise hope-
less to control.
BREAKING-IN heifers.
“Longo”: The dairying is
comparatively new in Queensland, but
in the matter of breaking-m heifers, we
are 40 years in advance of the Southland
(M.L.) farmer quoted by “Jaccart (B-
-29/11/’33- whose equipment comprised
a winch, wire and hempen ropes, and a
man behind her with a stick. .
General practice in my district is to
yard the heifer with the milking herd
some time before she is due to calve and
thus to get her used to going through
the milking-shed gates. Nobody uses
bails. Breaking-in is just a matter ot
closing the milking-stall gate in her face
(by means of the overhead wooden rod
for the purpose) and hitching the breech-
ing rope behind the new contributor
to the butter surplus. Of course, our
heifers are the result of generations ot
breeding.
SOIL BALANCE.
“Hatter”: “Agrarian” complains of the
loss of flavor and keeping qualities of
potatoes under the present system of
manuring heavily with am.-super. mix-
tures (B. 29/11/’33). I believe that this
is due to the lack of potash rather than
of lime, though naturally it is possible to
have soils too definitely acid even tor
spuds. ~ . ■
In assessing soil values a careful esti-
mation of the balance of at least four ot
the analytical figures is necessary—
namely, calcium, phosphate, potash and
nitrogen. Apart from its cropping value,
lime deficiency has been shown definitely
to lower the fertility of sheep on hill
pastures, and to lead to a considerable
increase in the number of pigs born dead
in a litter. Phosphate deficiency is also
serious, and is often the cause of abortion
and sterility in cattle.
The counties of Devon and Cornwall
(Eng.), principally medium loams, suffer
like many parts of Australia from an
extreme lime deficiency. But, owing to
a favorable climate, these districts
specialise in supplying early vegetables to
the London market, and acid soils are
useless for intensive culture. Fortunately,
the sea-sand round the coast is rich in
carbonate of lime, and in the past thou-
sands of tons of sand must have been con-
veyed to the inland districts to meet the
farmers’ need. Magnificent crops of
cereals and roots flourish in the midst ot
barren, heathy country —a striking testi-
mony to the possibility of neutralising an
acid soil. , , ,
Recently, however, there has been par-
tial failure of certain crops, such as
strawberries, violets, mangolds, etc., and
patches of ground in otherwise fertile
country failed to respond to cultivation
for some unknown reason. Over 2UUU
samples were analysed from the g° ocl .
and the “bad” patches, and it was found
that, while the lime and nitrogen con-
tents were fairly constant, the available

If any illustration in "THE BULLETIN" takas your fancy, write
to the MANAGER, who will quote you price for the ongmaL
phosphates, or “phosphate level,” and the
“potash level” showed extreme variations.
In many instances where these were both
high the yield was remarkably poor. The
evidence in hundreds of cases conclusively
proved that satisfactory growth is only
possible when these two fertilisers are
present in correct ratio. An excessively
high “phosphate level” in proportion to
the potash resulted in adverse condi-
tions for practically every crop. Good
results were obtained with a ratio up to
8 • 1 phosphate to potash, but when this
approached to 10:1 growth was stunted
and seeds failed to germinate. The soil
was practically poisoned.
Potash facilitates the production of
sugars and starches from the leaf; hence
its value for such crops as sugar-beet,
mangolds and potatoes. It stiffens the
straw of cereals and renders them less
liable to “lodge” in stormy weather ; and
it assists a plant to ripen fruit and seed
and to resist disease and pests. Wheat
is more resistant to rust, and tomatoes to
the various diseases that attack them, it
the soil is supplied with sufficient potash.
It also imparts flavor, particularly to the
potato, which is, I think, the reason why
those planted on new land are superior.
Usually they are planted after a burn,
which increases the available potash.
DEHORNING CATTLE.
“Baldy”: Few cattlemen seem to
realise the big advantages of dehorning.
The most important are:— .
(1) It minimises bruising in transit. lons
of meat is wasted through horning dur-
ing trucking. A , .
(2) Economy in freight; an extra beast
can be loaded to the truck if dehorned.
(3) Uniformity of appearance. De-
horned cattle do not show age or lack
of quality as much as they do with their
horns on. A Queensland grazier recently
sent in two trucks of fats, one truck with
tipped horns, the other truck natural. I he
former truck was found to give a big
surplus of first-grade meat compared with
the latter. Had the cattle been wholly
hornless it is hard to say how much more
successful it would have been.
Some argue that in most cases horns
grow again, and that the i ©growth
is ugly and detrimental. If the job is well
done there is no regrowth. The de-
horner must be pressed down on to the
skull as hard as possible, so as to take
in as much of the horn or bud as you
can get. Most people think it is enough
to cut the horn off “somewhere near the
base,” which certainly causes a most
hideous second growth.
Some cattlemen have had great results
through dehorning calves. One gets a
piece of piping red-hot, greases the hair
at the butt of the horn, places the pipe
well down over the horn and gives pipe
a twist round —it is claimed that the horn
falls off in about a week. If this method
is as successful as it is claimed it would
do away with all fly trouble.
It is not advisable to dehorn growing
cattle, as it sets them back considerably ;
but calves and anything over six years
old are very easily done and hardly notice
the operation. Do it when the feed is
green.
If the removal of the horn leaves a
cavity, fill it with cotton wool and Blo-
fli-di.
“Oolyara”: “Sheepo” doesn’t go far
enough (B. 22/11/’33). There are many
young selectors game enough to try for
themselves what grandad condemned. One
hasn’t to travel many miles in the Cen-
tral West to hear old hands condemn
fodder conservation. The chief reason
given is that stock won’t do any good on
bush hay, in our district principally
Mitchell grass. Perhaps “Sheepo’ will
drop a hint or two as to the best method
of conserving our native grasses.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
{Transferred from Service Department.)
How to dig paspalum out of a lawn ? Is
the use of a weedicide more effective than
way to get paspalum out of a lawn
is to go over it carefully with a Daisy hi ter,
a small prong instrument worked on a ful-
crum, but the work should be done after a
good soaking rain or a good soaking witn
the hose, as the roots then come out much
more completely. You could buy one of these
from any hardware store for about 3s. 6d.
Any good weedicide that could be applied,
besides killing the paspalum, would poison the
grass and soil around it for some niches and
cause unsightly brown patches in the law ,
and you would probably have to go over the
lawn two or three times to get rid of it, as
the roots are very hard to kill.
(1) Would it be better for a N.S.W. person
with £lOOO to invest in lucerne growing to buy
a small block outright or to lease a larger
property, perhaps with option of purchase .
(2) In buying outright, would it be better to
pay less per acre at Narrabn or more, per
acre at Cowra ? (3) Average rainfall at Jam-
worth and Dubbo? (4) How do black-soil
river flats compare with Mudgee and
River flats for lucerne, rainfall being e^ 1 .
(5) According to average prices, at return f
would one get per annum from 100 acres of
ill lucerne? (6) How many men would be
required all the year round to work 100 acres .
—9347.
(1) Lease a larger property. By having, say,
80 acres of lucerne and 350 to 400 acres ot grass
land, a mixed-farming proposition could be
carried on, dairying and fat-lamb raising being
run in conjunction with lucerne-hay production.
(2) In producing lucerne hay for the Sydney
market it would be advisable to be located
somewhere within a radius of 250 miles ot
the main market, otherwise freight charges on
the marketed products would be hign. Dis-
tricts such as Quirindi, Scone, Mudgee, Cpwra
and Canowindra are suitable for the mixed-
farming proposition mentioned. It the
intention is to buy a property, it would be
better to purchase • a smaller area, pay more
per acre and irrigate in localities not more
than 250 miles from the main market. (3)
The average rainfall at Tamworth for 48 years
is 26.53 in. The average rainfall at Dubbo tor
56 years is 21.99 in. (4) Black-soil river flats,
provided they are not of too heavy a texture,
should compare fairly favorably with portions
of the heavier type Mudgee and Hunter River
flats. Where the black soil is a sandy 19am it
will not set hard on the surface after irrigat-
ing, as is the case with heavy-textured black
soils. (5) With (a) 6cwt. seed sown on 100
acres per annum on non-irrigated land and (o)
9cwt. where irrigation is practised, the total
yields of hay per annum would be, approxi-
mately, for ( a ) five tons and ( b ) eleven tons
per acre. The average prices of lucerne hay
on the Sydney market for the past three years
are as follows:
1/7/’3O to 30/6/’3l .. £5 2s. Id. per ton
1/ 7 / ’3l to 30 /6 / ’32 .. £4 ss. Od. per ton
l/‘7/’32 to 30/6/’33 .. £4 11s. 3d. per ton
In general the prices ruling from 1/7/’33 to
date are lower than the average price tor the
year 1/7/’32 to 30/6/’33. (6) Three men would
be required to work the area if 100 acres were
under lucerne. Some of their time could be
devoted to the care and management ot stocK
on the mixed farm.
In spite of washing milk containers with cold
water first and then with hot, the water used
becomes very slimy. Reason of this slime, and
will it affect the milk or cream 3—9408. .
Owing to the meagre details supplied, it is
impossible to suggest a cause for the trouole.
If strong soda water is used to cleanse the
containers, it is possible for the hot water
used in the final sluicing to be what might
be described as slimy, owing to the presence
of an undue amount of soda. Or the mule
itself may be slimy.
How to rid a horse of worms 3—9503.
Treatment depends on the species of worms
involved. Some of the appropriate drugs are
dangerous, and can be used only under veteri-
nary supervision. A useful and safe drench is
compounded of 2oz. of oil of turpentine m
one pint of raw linseed oil, this to be admin-
istered to the horse after it has been starved
for 36 hours. After the horse has been drenched
it should be moderately exercised, but as soon
as purging commences it shou.d be stabled.
The drench may be repeated in three weeks
time.
How to cure a horse of a bad cough 3

Is it true that there is a variety of wheat
in W.A. which matures in 60 days 3 —9345.
The earliest variety of wheat m cultiya-ion
in WA. is known as “Noongaar.” ihis variety
matures about the end of October, and even
if planted in the spring, say, late in August,
the maturity might be regarded as not much
more than 60 days. Normally, however, it is
planted at the end of May or early in June,
and, under these circumstances, the maturity
would be from 140 to 150 days.

HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Carben”: Many a compost heap is
spoilt by the grower throwing fresh, dry
ashes on it. Ashes or lime liberate the
ammonia, which is lost in the form ot
gas. Great care should be taken also in
mixing manures together, as one often
neutralises the other. A manure-mixing
chart can be obtained from the N.S.W.
Agricultural Department. If fowl manure
is to be stored it should have dry earth
added to it in equal quantity. If allowed
to get wet, the ammonia, the most valuable
part, will be lost.
“Eureka”: To cure a horse of worms
cut up finely a small handful of tobacco
and put in the sun to dry thoroughly.
When dry, mix it with the horse’s feed.
Give him a dose once a week.
“W.P.T.”: The best way to make a
grey horse look his best is to wash him
with good soap with which has been
mixed some powdered charcoal. The
charcoal will make his coat nice and
“Cooramin”: Cabbage saltbush makes
an excellent dish when cooked like
garden spinach. In far-back camps thi>
wild vegetable is relished with eithei
fresh or corned meat.
“Gumblegubbin”: Native couch grass
should be grown around homesteads.
It has a spreading habit, grows thickly,
but only a few inches high, and, being
always green, it is thus the safest in
times of bushfires. Horses are fond
of it and keep it eaten down, and the
sward resembles a well-kept lawn. But
don’t let it get into the garden.


Out of the Past.
NULLI SECUNDUS.
BY J. H. M. ABBOTT.
IN 1846 Major Walter Fitzpatrick, late
Royal Horse Artillery, imported from
England the thoroughbred stallion
Primus, and sent him to his station on
the Upper Hunter, St. Swithin’s Hill.
Primus was a black horse, sixteen
hands high, with a remarkable patch that
looked like a splash of whitewash, the
size of a man’s hand, on the near
shoulder, just where the branding-iron is
usually applied. He had run third in the
Derby, and was as gentle as a dove.
Amongst the mares mated with Primus
had been Lady Secunda, a bay, owned
by the Major’s friend and neighbor Mr.
Thomas Robjohn, of Paddy’s Lagoon—
the fine run that afterwards became Rob-
john Park. The result of this union was
a splendid brown colt, with a large white
patch on his near shoulder. Him they
named Nulli Secundus.
When Nulli Secundus was three years
old he escaped from the horse paddock at
St. Swithin’s, and took to the ranges.
Thereafter for a time he ran wild
with a select harem of brumby mares ;
and this is the reason why, in that dis-
trict, you may still occasionally drop
across a hoTse, of no particular account,
who has a few white hairs on the near
shoulder, in the region of the brand.
The Major was furious when he learned
of the colt’s escape. He was in Sydney
at the time, but immediately took the
steamer for Morpeth, and travelled post-
haste up the river—through Maitland,
Singleton, Muswellbrook and Scone—to
St. Swithin’s Hill. Here, on the morning
after his arrival, he held a parade of his
employees in the garden, and addressed
them, scathingly and bitterly.
“Upon my soul,” he said, “I don’t
know of anyone in the colony who is
afflicted with such a set of incompetent
nincompoops as I employ. Here’s the
best colt in the district gets out of a
paddock that should be as horse-proof as
the pound in Scone. A three-rail fence,
seven feet high, if ’twas an inch, and
with good gates, having secure fastenings
upon them. You say it was intact, Mac-
pherson?”
“I went xound it myself, Major, when
Ben here reported the colt was out. There
was naething wrang wi’ it, an’ th’ gates
was shut,” replied Sandy Macpherson, the
overseer. He was a red-headed Austral-
Scot, six feet high.
“What time was that?” demanded
Major Fitzpatrick angrily.
“Ha’ past sax i’ th’ mornin’, sir.”
“And what did you do then?”
“I went out to look for him, Major,
takin’ Black Billy with me, to see if we
could track him. We found a lot o’
tracks of unshod horses outside the fence
across the flat yonder.” He pointed in
the direction away from the house,
towards the dark blue loom of Tinnabul
Mountain. “I’m thinkin’ ’twas half a
dozen brumby mares or so came down
in the night, an’ ca’d Nelly Secundy
awa’.”
“Oh, yes,” sneered the Major; “and no
doubt some of them unlatched the gates,
and he walked through. Nonsense! How
far did you go in search of him?”
“We rode all over Tinnabul, Major, an’
never got sight of him, or of a single
brumby, And I’ve had men out every
day since, and there isn’t a trace of th’
colt to be found.”
. Well, either one of you careless
hounds has left a gate unfastened or the
colt’s been stolen. I want him back.
Twenty pounds to any of you that can
run him in. But I doubt whether it’s
worth while making the offer to such a
set of d——d gaolbirds. Why, I’d”
But he was interrupted by Macpherson.
The red-headed overseer stepped up on
to the verandah, with a flushed face and
an ominously clenched fist.
“D’ye mean me, too, when ye talk
about ‘gaolbirds,’ Major Fitzpatrick?”
The Major looked at him in astonish-
ment. He had been used for years to
expressing his views to assigned servants
who were prisoners of the Crown, and
never before, in his Australian experience,
had anyone in his employment questioned
his say-so. Nearly all his men had been
convicts. He forgot that Macpherson was
a free Australian, son of two of Dr.
Lang’s immigrants from Scotland. Like
many Australians of the first generation,
he had inherited his parents’ accent and
mode of speech ; inherited also their dis-
taste for being regarded as convicts or
the children of convicts.
Major Fitzpatrick lost his temper.
“Of course, I do. You are the person
responsible for the loss of the colt. You
may consider yourself dismissed, Mac-
pherson.”
“D’ye mean that ye call me a gaolbird,
sir?” persisted the overseer.
The Major roared at him. He was
raging over the colt’s disappearance.
“Why, damme, yes! Of course, I do.
Come to the office for your cheque.”
“Then tak’ that!” remarked Macpher-
son, stepping forward and catching the
Major a stinging blow with his open
hand on the side of his whiskered face.
“I’ll let no man say that o’ me! ”
The blow knocked the Major over
against the weatherboard front wall of
the house. With a howl, he gathered him-
self together, put up his hands and rushed
at his late overseer.
But that gentleman was too quick. His
left fist shot out, and caught the Major
on the point of the jaw. Immediately
the latter crumpled up on the floor of
the verandah, and “took the count.”
“Carry him inside, some o’ ye,” said
Macpherson as he walked away in the
direction of his hut. “Run up my horses,
Black Billy, like a good lad. I’ll hae to
be awa’ before th’ Major sends one o’
ye into Scone for the police. No—he
ain’t hurted. He’ll come to presently.
but a tap I gave him. If I’d hit
him in earnest”
So Macpherson took his four horses
and rode away from St. Swithin’s.
The red-headed overseer had become a
memory at St. Swithin’s when Edward
Hargraves started off down Lewis Ponds
Creek, in the country of granite, slate and
quartz, to see whether he couldn’t find
the gold he had been unsuccessful in
picking up in California, and so came to
Summerhill Creek and a new epoch in
the story of Australia.
It is not easy, eighty-two years after-
wards, to realise adequately how com-
pletely uprooted, overturned, remodelled
and reconstituted was the social side of
Australia by the discovery of gold.
Few people thought of anything but
gold, the finding of gold, and the process
of getting rich quickly. Fleets of ships
were abandoned in Port Jackson and Port
Phillip ; farms and stations could not be
worked because there was no one to work
them ; flourmills had to be closed down ;
Government offices were barely able to
be carried on ; theatres were empty ; even
churches had to shut their doors —because
those who had conducted them had gone
to the diggings. The fever of gold-seeking
had infected everyone.
It is not surprising, therefore, to come
upon Major Walter Fitzpatrick, late
R.H.A. driving along the Bathurst road,
across the summit of the Blue Mountains,
very early on a sunny morning in April,
1852, bound, like many hundred others,
for the new Eldorado on the western
slopes of the Dividing Range.
He still owned St. Swithin’s, which had
been left under the care of Tom Robjohn,
but had been unable to resist the call of
adventure. He was going to the Mac-
quarie Valley rather to see for himself
what all the fuss was about than to
add to the pretty considerable fortune
that was already his.
Seated erect in a high gig, in which
he drove a pair of fine bays tandem
fashion—top-hatted, boxer-coated, cor-
rectly side-whiskered in the fashion of the
period—with his servant, a small Cockney
named Enery Hadams, on the seat beside
him, the Major was one of the most
remarkable of the many pilgrims who
were traversing the Western Road made
by Sir Thomas Mitchell a score of years
before. His grand manner, the smartness
of his turnout, and his bearing of con-
descending superiority induced many of
them to believe that he was, at least, some
high and important official proceeding to
his duties on the goldfields.
The native-born regarded him with a
certain sour and ill-concealed distaste as
a representative of the old and much-
disliked bureaucratic regime that they felt,
instinctively, was passing away; the'
new arrivals looked upon him with
awe as being one of the Quality to
whom they were wont to pay respectful
deference in older lands. As for the
Major, he took little notice of, or interest
m, the procession through which he made
his progress.
But at the Weatherboard—now known
as Wentworth Falls—two of his fellow-
guests at the roadside inn where he had
passed the night had taken more than a
casual interest in the Major’s equipage
and himself. Messrs. Twomey and Hard-
castle, lately of Port Arthur, in Van
Diemen’s Land, about to inaugurate a
small enterprise in the highway robbery
line, felt convinced that the leather
dispatch-box which they perceived ’Enery
Hadams remove with such care from
beneath the seat of the gig must contain
money or valuables that might with
advantage pass into their possession.
They could not know that all of value
that it held were the Major’s silver-
backed hairbrushes, razors, boot-shining
equipment, pomades, unguents, clothes-
brush and two bottles of old French
brandy.
“Bill,” remarked Mr. Twomey to Mr.
Hardcastle as they smoked their pipes
in the stableyard after tea, “I heard him
tell th’ landlord he wanted to start off
at two o’clock in th’ mornin’, so’s to
avoid th’ heat an’ th’ crowd. Wot’s th’
matter wi’ us two makin’ a start at one
o’clock, an’ awaitin’ his nobs at some
conwenient place along th’ road, w’ere
we can stick ’im up in comfort an’
quiet?”
“A good idea, Jimmy-me-lad. An’
mebbe we’ll be able to get away from
th’ inn wi’out a-payin’ th’ score.”
The two enterprising Vandemonians
rode away at 1.15 —not, however, with-
out discharging their liabilities to host
Naylor. Naylor was too old a hand at the
game of running bush taverns to leave
his stable door unlocked after dark.
Just as the sun rose over the tree-tops
in front of him, Sergeant Alexander Mac-
pherson, of the Mounted Police, came
riding down the Bathurst road, on his
way to Sydney to report himself at head-
quarters for some special duty. The
sergeant was mounted upon a magnificent
brown stallion, singularly marked on the
near shoulder with what appeared, at a
little distance, to be a splash of white-
wash about the size of a man’s hand.
He was about half-way between his
resting-place for the night, Mount Vic-
toria, and Blackheath, passing round the
spur of a ridge between dense forests of
eucalyptus on either hand, when the
sound of two pistol shots, fired in rapid
succession, and the yelling of angry
voices, just beyond the bend in the road,
caused him to gather up his reins, draw
his carbine from its bucket, and urge his
distinguished-looking charger forward.
Round the end of the ridge the road
straightened into an avenue through the
scrubby forest, and as he opened up its
long, straight vista Sergeant Macpherson
beheld one of those stirring incidents of
highway robbery which have been sup-
posed to endow that precarious business
with some of the elements of romance.
The low sun, sending level rays across
and through the dark tree-tops, dazzled
him as he emerged from the cold
shadow of the hill on his right. He
checked his horse, dropped the reins
across the holsters and shaded his eyes
with his left hand, the better to observe
what was going on ahead. The brown
stallion stood perfectly still, as though
trained to such business, gently champing
the heavy military bit.
There was a high dogcart, or gig,
thirty yards away, in which a tall man
in a top-hat sat holding his hands above
his head, whilst a smaller man in a
cabbage-tree posed similarly beside him.
The shafts of the vehicle rested on the
ground ; a dead horse lay between them.
The leading horse of the tandem team
lay upon the ground, kicking spasmodi-
cally, whilst a red-whiskered individual
knelt upon his head. Standing up, a brace
of pistols in each hand, covering the
two occupants of the gig, was a black-
bearded man - who bawled threats and
imprecations at the two travellers.
“This ain’t no play-hactin’. Climb out
o’ that there dawg-cart, both of yous ; an’
don’t forgit for to keep y’r ’ands up or
I’ll blow y’r lights out.”
Gently, Sergeant Macpherson picked
up the carbine that lay across his knees,
softly cocked the hammer, examined the
nipple for a brief moment to be sure it
was properly capped, and raised it to his
shoulder. For a few brief seconds he
took aim, and then —just as an assembly
of kookaburras in the trees close at hand
burst into a chorus of derisive laughter—
he pulled the trigger.
The brown stallion snorted as the car-
bine roared, and the acrid white smoke
tickled his nostrils, but stood perfectly
still. The man with the pistols flung
them away from him convulsively and
tumbled forward on to his face.
A couple of horses whinnied in a
startled fashion somewhere amongst the
trees on the left. With a shout, Major
Fitzpatrick drew a pistol from his coat
pocket and fired at the man who was
holding the leader down on the ground,
and then jumped over the near-side wheel
and made to run towards him.
Mr. Jimmy Twomey sprang to his feet
and stepped back to pick up the pistol
which he had deposited behind him.
Before he reached it he received the tre-
mendous buffet of a galloping horse, and
was sent spinning, senseless. *
Sergeant Macpherson reined in his
charger in a cloud of dust. He leapt from
the saddle, ran back to the unconscious
bushranger, handcuffed his hands behind
his back, and then turned round to look
at the people whom he had so oppor-
tunely rescued from the highwaymen.
The little man in the cabbage-tree was
at the tandem leader’s head, assisting him
to rise. The whiskered gentleman in the
top-hat was staring at him, the Sergeant,
as if he had seen a ghost.
Good God, Sandy Macpherson!”
gasped the Major.
Be th’ Lor-rd, ’(is Major Fitzpatrick!”
groaned the Sergeant.
For a moment the two men stood and
stared at one another without speaking.
Presently the Major found his voice.
“Macpherson,” he said, “last time We
encountered one another it was in anger.
I insulted you grossly, and you very
rightly punished me for doing so. But
I am in your debt for what you’ve done
for me this morning. I trust we are
friends again. These scoundrels —I think
you’ve accounted for one of them—these
ruffians were at the Weatherboard last
night, and must have ridden on ahead of
us to bail us up. I’ve a thousand pounds
in banknotes in my pocket-book, which
I was taking with me to the goldfields, in
case a possible investment should turn
up. I thank you heartily. Shake hands,
and let bygones be bygones.”
Mechanically, Sandy Macpherson ex-
tended his big fist, which the Major
shook fervently.
But the Sergeant’s eyes did not meet
his. They were fixed upon the brown
stallion, now grazing on the short grass
at the roadside. He was pale and ner-
vous.
The Major was all enthusiastic grati-
tude, and did not seem to notice any-
thing out of the way in the bearing of
his rescuer. He continued his eulogy of
the gallant policeman.
“A fine bit of work—fine as anything I
ever saw on service. Your hand again,
my dear fellow. Pray did you enlist in
the Mounted Police when you left my
service?”
“Not—not altogither at once, Major.
Some time afterwards.”
“Ah, and what were you doing, man?
I tried to find you pretty hard—ha! ha!
—but that’s all over now.”
“Well, I put in a couple o’ months
chasing brumbies at the back o’ Tinnabul,
Major—running ’em into trap-yards in
the ranges. Breaking in the best o’ them.
Took a mob down to Maitland, and sold
’em at Campbell’s Hill before T went to
Sydney and joined the police.”
“And you had luck, I hope. You got
some good horses?”
“Yes, Major,” replied the Sergeant
hesitatingly. “I had a good deal o’ luck.”
“Well, now, Macpherson, I’m going to
make you a present of a couple of these
notes —of £2OO. I trust you’ll accept it
as a small mark of my gratitude for
this morning’s work. I hope you will.”
The Sergeant shook his head.
“No, thank you, sir; ’twas but my
duty.”
“Well, have it your own way. But isn’t
there some way I can serve you?”
For a moment Sandy Macpherson
looked at him doubtfully. Then he
smiled a little, and glanced again beyond
the gig behind the Major.
“Well, yes, sir, there is,” he said
slowly. “Ye remember that colt, Nulli
Secundus, that got away from St.
Swithin’s?”
“Yes, of course. A most promising
animal. What about him?”
“Ye’ll remember, sir, ye offered a
reward o’ £2O to whoever could run
him in?”
“Oh, yes ; and nobody ever did get him
—worse luck!”
“Well, if I was to find him, could I
keep him and no questions asked, an’
without considering the reward?”
The Major’s enthusiasm was unabated.
“Of course, of course. Anything you
like, my dear Macpherson. I’m most
infernally obliged to you.
“Would ye mind stepping this way,
Major?”
He led the way to where Nulli
Secundus was grazing at the edge of the
timber. The beautiful horse raised his
head and gazed at them with kindly eyes
as they approached. The Sergeant picked
up the bridle and turned him so that his
near shoulder was visible to the Major,
who started when he saw the white mark.
For a moment or two he stared at it in
amazement. Then he laughed, and
clapped Macpherson on the back.
“Well, I’ll be d d! But, of course,
my dear Macpherson—of course, of
course! ”

The Kerrigan Boys.
My oath,, it’s hot on the track to-day; my
flannel is soaked with sweat.
I think I’ll sit in the shade a bit and wait
for the sun to set.
I know of a decent camping place by the
river bevond the town, ,
And I’d rather carry my swag through there
after the sun goes down.
A touch of pride? Well, perhaps it is, though
I haven’t much cause for pride.
It’s sixteen years to a day almost since old
man Kerrigan died;
Sixteen years, and his place is sold, and the
fortune he left us spent.
Well the road downhill is an easy road, and
that was the way we went.
Kerrigan, that was our father’s name, was one
of the tough old sort.
He held by graft as he held by God, and he
hated drink and sport.
We lads were fond of a bit of fun, but e
kept us under the rein,
And we had to bow to the old man s will
though it went against our gram.
He was kind enough in his grim old way, but
we had to earn our keep,
Driving horses and milking cows, branding an
shearing sheep.
Ho wonder we bucked a bit at tunes, for you
know what youngsters are. ....
We mustn’t dance at the local hall or drmk in
Mulligan’s bar.
Those were the orders the old man gave, but
we did it just the same.
Jack was two years younger than I, so I was
the more to blame.
But I’ve sometimes thought had Dad been less
hard and left us a bit more free
It might have been better for him, perhaps,
and better for Jack and me.
The old man dropped in the yard one day
where we had the weaners penned.
We picked him up and we carried him home,
but we knew that it was the end.
The neighbors gathered for miles around; he
hadn’t a single foe,
And the crowd that stood round the open
grave spoke well for the man below\
Our only sister had died at birth, and our
mother was long since dead,
And we found that we were the only heirs
when the old man’s will was read.
We were just a couple of country lads, we
had never been off the farm:
We’d been held in check from our boyhood
up by the weight of the old man’s arm.
We were good in the saddle, I needn’t say. The
old man kept a stud,
For the love of a horse for a horse’s sake is
strong in the Irish blood.
But breeding was only a hobby with him, a
sort of a harmless craze,
Though I sometimes fancied he’d had his fling
’way back in his younger days.
We got mixed up with a racing crowd, and
started to go the pace;
We forgot the sound of the old man’s voice
and the frown on his rugged face.
For the road downhill is an easy road, though
it ends in a swift descent;
We were only youngsters, a reckless pair and
that was the way we went.
We staked for a win on the Chester colt on
the strength of a trial he showed,
But someone got to the boy on top —we knew
by the race he rode.
He lost ten lengths, and he finished last. It
was useless to make a fuss;
The men we met in the racing game were
far too cunning for us.
We backed him again in the Graytown Cup
and he won by half the straight,
But we left our cash in the bookies’ bags, for
he failed to draw the weight.
We cursed the jockey, we cursed the horse,
and we sold him there and then.
We’d had our fill of the racing game and the
ways of racing men.
We sat and drank in Mulligan’s pub, and
gambled the whole night long;
We dealt in cattle, we dealt in sheep, and most
of our deals went wrong.
As long as the bank would cash our cheques
we didn’t care what we spent,
For the road downhill is an easy road, and
that was the way we went.
Then things got bad, and a drought came on,
and it lasted over a year;
Our dams gave out and our stock died off, and
we knew that the end was near.
Our credit stopped and the bank foreclosed,
and our father’s place was sold.
We found we had wasted all we had, as the
Prodigal found of old.
It was five years after the old man’s death
together we took the track;
We swagged it into the nearest town, and I
had a drink with Jack.
Then he shook my hand and he wished me
luck; I knew he was close to tears,
And I’ve never set eyes on Jack since then,, or
heard of him now for years.
Somewhere out to the west of Bourke he’s
humping his swag maybe,
Tramping along in the broiling sun and cursing
himself and me.
I’d give two years of my worthless life, though
it may not last that long,
For one more look in his honest face, one grip
of his fingers strong.
Well, that’s the tale of the Kerrigan boys, and
the moral is near the end:
You’ll always have plenty of friends at hand
as long as you’ve cash to spend.
We had our chance and we played the fool,
and it’s too late now to repent,
For the road downhill is an easy road, and
that was the way we went.
VICTORIA.

FROM CHINA TO PERU.
There is no more picturesque force m
the world than the Shanghai Volunteer
Corps. Formed in the stormy days ot the
Taiping rebellion to protect the settlement
from wandering hordes, it has weathered
any number of storms since. In 1914 it
had the ticklish job of invading Chinese
territory containing a million hostile
Celestials and seizing a police station
whence rebels were organising an
attack on the international settlements.
There is a link between it and Australia r
its commandant for the last few years
has been Colonel N. W. B. B. Thoms.
Thoms is an Australian, known in
Shanghai as “Anzac” Thoms.

The exotic Marlene Dietrich and the
human Marie Dressier are more than
film queens ; they are real women to two
Sydney men. Tenor Garti can tell you
all about Marie’s taking London by
storm as a topliner in vaudeville. He
was doing the Stoll circuit when Mane
was its bright and particular star, lhe
other week in Paris Hugo Larsen met
and talked for quite a time with Mar-
lene. That was in a spot very far re-
moved from anything recalled by Shang-
hai Express”; it was at a Chopin recital
in the Champs Elysees, Pouishnoff was
the artist (he will be in Australia about
next February), and of him some critic
has said “It is doubtful whether Liszt
was ever more brilliant.” Anyway he
was five when he met his first audience
in Petrograd. He will be 41 during his
Australian tour.

“FS”* History appears likely to re-
peat ' itself in the case of sculptor
Epstein. When Titian started painting
real men, women and babies instead or
the orthodox saints, there was an outcry
such as greeted the-exhibition of Epstein *
figure of Christ. But Titian won in
the end. Now the Dean of Liverpool,
having inspected a recent show ot
Epsteinian deformities, has hinted that
he would like to see the sculptors

of Japan, as a manifestation of national-

classed. The young military and naval
officers who were tried for the murder
of Premier Inukai and the bombing of
a bank also confessed to designs on
Charlie Chaplin, who was then on a visit
to the land of the chrysanthemum.
“Charlie is a popular figure in the United
States,” they said, “and particularly the
darling of the capitalists. We believed
that killing him would cause a war with
America, and thus, so to speak, we could
kill two birds with one stone. As an-
other of their plans was an air raid on
Tokio and the destruction of the power

of a military Government, it seems as
if the pie-throwing comedian waddled
out of danger just in time.

“Kingston”: The descendants of the
Bountymutineers are not without.t sense
of humor. Just after the Strathnaver
dropped anchor off Norfolk Island on
her last cruise an islander boarded the
shin in an official capacity, and was
instantly buttonholed by a lady passen-
ger. This conversation ensued :
“Do you known Mr. So-and-so?”
“Very well, indeed.”
“What’s he look like?
When’ the passengers were being towed
ashore in a string of rowing boats, one
man was plainly scared. He crouched
in the bottom of the boat. An islander
tried to reassure him. “Don’t sit down
there,” he drawled; “you’ll get your
pants wet.” Ashore, the same islander
put me on a horse that liked nothing
better than to get the bit between his
teeth and gallop. He was an excepho
to the rest of the hacks. How far to
the cable station?” I squired of another
horseman on the road. About a quarter
of a mile.” I rode for half a mile and
inquired again, and got the same reply
from another citizen. The same questio

NORTH OF
TWENTY- EIGHT
End of the Session »
„ . Queensland’s Parliament
got through 36 bills during the late ses-
on. the closing stages were marked
by repeated applications of the gag, and
Opposition tempers were frayed when
the Premier said the shutters would go
up until January 16 as a preliminary to
six months’ adjournment.
Forgan s attempt, to pour oil on the
troubled waters by congratulating both
parties on the absence of rancor and
the seemly spirit displayed throughout
the session there were several references
to dogs and hounds at times, as well as
to bars and mongrels—flopped dismally.
When he sat down to wait for the soft
answer he didn’t get it. Opposition-
leader Moore conducted a commination
service m which Forgan’s sins of omis-
sion and commission were ticked off, and
he was helped by Godfrey Morgan and
others until the Speaker ruled the lot out
of order. No olive branch was proffered
to b organ, and the only reply to his felici-
tations came from Speaker Pollock who
returned thanks for the Parliamentary
officials —an unprecedented ending for a
Queensland session.
“Shanks”: These Australian young-
sters again. The other day a Bundaberg
resident noticed a 14-year-old
girl, obviously weary and dis-
tressed, leading a horse
through a suburb. A footsore
cattle-dog walked behind her.
Something about the little
lady made the resident stop
her, and she incontinently
collapsed. She had travelled
from Nambour with her
father, who was hoping to
get work in the North, to
Gladstone after about 300
miles on and olf the main
road in a sulky. The sulky
broke down. Then the father
decided to “jump the rattler”
back to Nambour, leaving his
daughter with the horse and
the dog to do the three-hun-
dred-mile trip by road. On
the way she had been
marooned among flood
waters and had slept in the
timber every night. Bunda-
berg has a kind heart. Jt
paid her fare to Nambour.

“Greek God”: Re Ken-
nedy Ryan being the first
ranker to become Commis-
sioner of Queensland police
He wasn’t; his predecessor
Pat Short, who retired in
1925, was. William Edward
Parry-Okeden and Frederick
Charles Urquhart both rose
from the position of cadet sub-inspector
of the Native Constabulary to the Com-
missionership. Parry-Okeden afterwards
wrote his memoirs, and Urquhart, while
in the Cloncurry district, published a
book of verses entitled “Camp Fire Can-
zonets.” He was later Administrator of
the Northern Territory. The first Com-
missioner, J. Seymour, was a Royal Irish
Constabulary man (as so many were in
those times) ; so was Major Cahill, who
was also at one time Under-Secretary to
the Home Department.

“J.”: Rev. James Noble is not the only
native to take holy orders (“M.T.,” B.
13/12/’33); Rev. David Unaipon, Pres-
byterian, is a full-blooded abo. He
is a member of the Narrinyerri tribe, and
was reared and educated at the Pt.
Macleay Mission station (S.A.). As a
philosopher, inventor, musician, scholar
and preacher he quite holds his own. He
reads and quotes Huxley and Darwin
fluently. Unaipon married one of his own
race. There are many abo. children
attending our public schools who bid fair
to equal Rev. Noble and Rev. Unaipon
Irene, a full-blooded gin in N.Q., not
only speaks perfect English, but can
speak, read and write French, Esperanto
and Italian. She also has a smattering of
Japanese.

northern coast who used to sleep in the
saloon of the ancient Peregrine, or six

rolling mal-de-mer factory, will be a bit
round-eyed at the vessel which the
Melbourne Steamship Co. has ordered,
ohe will be about 10,000 tons, with
accommodation for 400 passengers.
Bunks will mostly give place to bedsteads.
Every cabin will have hot and cold water
and many will have private bathrooms.
She will be ready for the winter tourist
trade in 1935.

“Rastus”: In a private home in Bris-
bane there reposes a literary item which
would be better in the Mitchell Library
—the first joint effort of Raymond,
Philip and Jack Lindsay as artists,
writers and publishers. Hand-printed in
neat lettering, it includes some delightful
pirate studies by Raymond, and stories
and verses by all three. It was done
when the boys were in their teens, and
clearly indicates which artistic path each
was to follow.
* * * *
“Kaloa”: Mention of the Ninigo Islands
—they have been raided by Jap trochus
pirates—reminds me that stranger things
than raids have happened there. Once
there was a missionary who journeyed to
Longan in a 8.P.. steamer and on the
way indulged in acts of conversion among
the passengers. To those who nightly
cried “Two-bottle-beer-he-come” he
preached on the evils of liquor. He took
the captain to task over his whisky-and-
soda. He excoriated the Manhattan and
hurled anathema at the gin swizzle. At
one young man in particular he ful-
minated, and that young man went
ashore at Longan with a wine-colored
bottle and some light sea-green effer-
vescent bottles in a bag and sat upon the
D.O.’s verandah. Presently there came
unto him and the D.O. the missionary in
“Can you get a drop of good beer about here ?”
“Gibbit sixpence, an ’ this pfeller soon find out.”
a pith helmet, sweating—it is two degrees
below the Equator—like a bull in Hades.
“You need a long, cool drink,” said the
D.O. hospitably; “some pink lemonade
now?” And, lo! he gave the missionary
six fingers of the cherry brandy which
the young man had brought, mixed up
with cool soda water and half a muli.
And two hours afterwards the captain
sent four strong boys to carry the
missionary to the launch on a stretcher,
and the young man carried his helmet fol-
ium. Then did the captain put the mis-
sionary to bed with many wise words
about the evils of over-indulgence, and
the good man was no more seen for
many days, nay, not even when we landed
at Awa, where the ladies are very white
and attractive and go about garbed in
a fig-leaf like Eve. But the sound of the
cocktail-shaker and the popping of corks
was loud and frequent over the Stilles
Meer.
* * * *
“X.”: One matter of court routine
which needs reform in the Northern Ter-
ritory is the system which allows the
Aborigines Protection Department to
plead for natives charged with offences.
How it works was shown in the case of
a boy charged with being drunk in
the abo. compound. The department
pleaded guilty on his behalf, but his em-
ployer, having interviewed him while
under arrest in the presence of a police-
man, found that the boy denied being
drunk or incapable and made a row
about the matter. The department then
withdrew its plea and the employer was
allowed to make a statement. The black
was convicted, but it is a bad method
and must lodge a lot of colored persons
in gaol. It doesn’t matter to them, be-
cause they regard the local quod merely
as a place where there are lashings of
good tucker ; but the wretched taxpayer
stumps up for their holiday, and his
feelings should be considered. Where a
native is thought to be incapable of
pleading, the matter should be left to the
Court.
* * * *
“Vic”: The poor old grazier—his
troubles never end! Last year at this
time the shepherd kings of Emerald
(C.Q.) and thereabouts were scratching
to find a patch or two of grass to keep
their wilting stock alive. This year there
is so much grass and it is so widespread
that they have the greatest trouble in
keeping their sheep on hand so that they
can deal with the cloud of pests. Burr
abounds, and blowfly has become a
menace instead of a mere curse. Sheep
are being struck all over, and new varie-
ties of fly seem to have been evolved
specially for the season, which is reported
locally to be the worst for 50 years. The
loss of sheep is estimated at 25 per cent.
* * * *
“Gilbert”: Dave Cronin has followed
Jim Love to the golden paddocks, and his
passing has robbed Australia of a great
horseman. In the days when horses were
horses and men’s lives depended on them
his name was something to conjure with.
Many a magnificent draft he picked for
India, and in dozens of showrings in
later days he gave a few minutes’ lesson
to exhibitors which turned them from
horse-wreckers into horse-builders. Later
years were sad for the old man. He lived
for his stock, and as sires deteriorated
and demand for good bone and conforma-
tion began to give way before showring
fancy and mechanics his occupation and
his life interest began to fail him. It is a
pity he should have died without writing
a book. As a teller of tales, both in
manner and in matter, he had few equals,
for he had been bred beside campfires to
the frequenters of which crocodiles and
wild mobs, Flinders riders and bushfires
and blacks were part of everyday life,
so that it took a good yarn to get by
with them.
* * * *
“Ah Wat”: Whatever else you may
say about Darwin it has achieved almost
perfect democracy. When the “Christ-
mas” ship left for the South, the pas-
senger list in the local press, and as
sent by correspondents to Queensland
papers, began with the name of the
wife of a moderately junior civil
servant, waltzed round among a few pea-
nut cockies and presently came to “Mrs.
Weddell (wife of the Administrator).” The
man who got the biggest part of the vale-
dictory par. was a constable who is going
to South Aus. to learn what a finger-print
looks like so that he can add a little terror
to the life of the evildoer, who already
can’t move in this unpropitious land with-
out somebody following his big-toe prints
in the sand. The only thing we ever
draw the line at is color.

E. G. Clerk, one of an old western
Queensland clan, returned to his native
land from England recently, having left
it for South Africa in 1901 as a subaltern
in the sth Q. 1.8. After the Boer War,
in which he was wounded, he settled in
Natal until the Zulu rising of 1906-7
again made a casualty of him. Stock-
raising occupied him until 1914, when
he attended the German South-west
shivoo, and later went to Egypt with the
South African infantry to serve against
the Senussi in western Egypt in 1915-16.
After that came France and further
wounds until the Armistice, after which
he drew a D.S.O. issue. Flying then
interested him, and, after some years in
South Africa, he instituted a passenger
service in the North of England until a
bad motor smash again sent him into
hospital. Temporarily broken in body
but undefeatable in spirit, Clerk looks to
recovery in Queensland before returning
to his overseas interests.

“El V.’s” appreciation:
My old friend Spencer Browne, a seventh-
generation Australian, who is retiring in a
blaze of presentations and parties in Brisbane,
has been connected with the Brisbane “Courier”
• r y ears > ar, 4 he has been an editor ever
s ' nce ? ae reached his majority. He came from
the North when he was only 25 to edit the
Courier’s” evening paper, and ever since, ex-
cept for intervals while he was away on mili-
tary duty during the shearers’ strike and the
Boer and Great Wars, he has maintained the
connection. For a time he was in England
on the “Daily Chronicle” staff, acting at the
same time as a “Courier” correspondent, but
.London did not suit him. S.B. is a courtly old
gentleman with a thorough knowledge of the
technique of journalism, and he drifted from
gallery to leader-writer’s chair and into the
financial editorship with equal facility. He
is probably the only working journalist in Aus-
tralia with two particular distinctions: he is
a major-general and he writes Gurney’s short-
hand; the original “Hansard” system. Queer
shorthands ran in the family when he was a
Parliamentary reporter. With Spencer Browne
following his system, Mackinnon writing Sloan
Duployan, M. J. Flynn scuttling along in
Lowe s, another man with script and a Pitman
writer or so, there was no danger of any-
body poaching on anybody else’s notes.

Gals’ Gossip from Brisbane
Christmas campers have been dribbling back
to relate sad tales of blown-away tents, washed-
away beer and general discomfort. Even hotel-
dwellers had a thin time. The much-advertised
slacks and shorts remained creased and immacu-
late, for it rained so steadily that the beaches
were out of the question. However, there was
nothing to stop the crowd from dancing, and
dance they did, day and night.
Thanks to the Main Roads Board, bitumen
roads go all the way to almost all our bay re-
sorts, but off the bitumen it is another story.
An irate parent says that it took him five and
a half hours to motor his family back from
Redcliffe, but more than one-third of the
time was consumed in doing the 100 yards
of “made” road which lay between the family
gate and the Anzac Highway.
For the first time the Natural Health Society
is holding' a holiday camp in Queensland —at
Ferndale, Ashgrove; but “camp” is hardly the
correct term, for Ferndale is one of Brisbane’s
oldest and largest houses. However, it must
have required a bit of stretching to get 150
people into the place. Brisbane, as a whole,
seems to have no special yearning for natural
health, fewer than a dozen disciples having been
gathered in here; but a big party from Mel-
bourne has joined up, and several others have
come down from Rockhampton, Bundaberg and
Maryborough. Meat is taboo, and tobacco is
frowned on. Raw carrots and greens grace the
tables, and the N.H.-ites, sensibly clad in shorts
and shirts (if male) or dittoes and blouses (if
female) eurhythmic through the days. The raw
diet seems to promote energy. F. G. Roberts,
of Melbourne, is boss cocky of the camp, and
pretty Clarice Cox, the singer, is secretary.
Tessa Reading, daughter of editor Reading
and his charming wife, is off to Sydney en
route to America. Tessa is to join a married
sister, Mrs. Freeborn Johnston, in Washington.
Firmin McKinnon, one of Brisbane’s most
erudite pressmen, is a big hit on the wireless.
Early in January he will deal with the progress
of various Australian towns, from the days
when the scrub was untouched until the present
era.
One woman in Brisbane spent the Christmas
for which she has yearned for about 20 years.
Having packed her family off to various holi-
day resorts, she put the front-door bell out of
action, locked the back gate and retired to
bed. A thermos of tea and another of coffee,
a barrel of biscuits on a small table and a
large armful of books she has been wanting
to read for months, and never has had time to
tackle, constituted her Christmas preparations.
She says this is the first and the most wonderful
possible rest that she has had since she married.
The showery weather on Wednesday caused
the lawns at Ascot to burst into a perfect forest
of umbrellas. Dressing was mixed, the more
cautious wearing lightweight-tailored suits, while
the courageous sported frilly and flower-
bestrewn frocks. Each party had its turn, for
the tailor-mades trotted round during the
showers as though inviting comment on their
sense, and when the sun came out —as it did
every now and then—the flowery ladies preened
themselves among the drenched flowerbeds.
The Glasgow lady 'brought along quite a family.
The clans are beginning to gather for
Beth Glasgow’s wedding; among them is
the lady’s sister, Miss Stumm, of Rockhampton.
Mrs. B. McLachlan (a daughter of the Glas-
gow household), from S. Australia, looked
smart in black-and-white checks, and the Glas-
gow lady defied the rain in pale green crepe
de Chine. Champion polo-player Billy Feez
and his wife (she was Bobs Ricardo, and is
related to the Mowbray and Thompson fami-
lies) picked several winners, and Mr. and
Mrs. Willis Dent (the lady in a floral-patterned
shantung frock) seemed to be enjoying the
rain and the green lawns —neither being very
common in Dalby.
A. E. Moore, who hasn’t followed the Par-
liamentary dispersal all over Queensland, was
accompanied by Mrs. Moore, who looked hand-
some in navy and white georgette and a navy
blue hat. Mrs. Moore likes blue, and wears
it a lot; it matches her eyes. Silas Harding,
who usually judges the blood horses at the
Brisbane Show, came down from Ipswich for the
races, and carried Mrs. Silas along with him.
This was the first day of the Christmas and
New Year meetings, the rain having made it
impossible to ask any decent horse to perform
on Boxing Day.

Who are the world’s boxing champions in
the different divisions; their nationalities and
ages? —9s49. ..
Heavyweight, Primo Camera (24), Italian,
light-heavyweight, Maxie Rosenbioom (29),
American; middleweight, Marcel• Thu (29),
French, and Vince Dundee (29), Italian-
American, both claim the title; welterweight,

weight, Barney Ross (24), American; f eather-
weight. Kid Chocolate (25), Cuban; bantam-
weight, A 1 Brown (31), Panaman; flyweight-
Jackie Brown (26), English.
Is Maxie Rosenbioom, light-heavyweight
champion of the world, considered a knockout
artist ? Where and when was he born, and
whom did he win the 12 st. lib. title from.
9411.
Rosenbioom is not considered a hard-hitter,
although 11 of the more than 200 men he
has met were knocked out by him. He
was born in New York on September 4, 1904,
and won the world’s light-heavyweight title
which Tommy Loughran relinquished to light
as a heavyweight, when he defeated Jimmy
Slattery in Buffalo, N.Y., on June 25, 1930.
Is Eddie Tolan, amateur runner of America,
white or colored ? Is he amateur champion
of the world ? What occupation does he foi-
low ? 9464.
Tolan is a colored man. He won the world’s
amateur sprint championship at the 1932 Los
Angeles Olympic Games, covering 100 metres
in 10 l-ssec., 3-5 of a second faster than the
professional record made by Jack Donaldson
at Melbourne in 1911. Tolan follows no occu-
pation other than running.
How is the winner of a set decided in tennis .
—9529. .
The player who first wins six games wins
a set except as below. If both players have
won five games, the score is “games-all, and
the next game won by a player is scored
“advantage” for that player If the same
player wins the next game, he wins the set,
if the other player wins the next game, the
score is again “games-all”; and so on until
a player wins two games more than his oppo-
nent, when the set is scored for that player.
What are the calls in solo whist and their
respective values, and what is the generally-
accepted authority as to rules of play . 948 /.
According to “Hoyle Up to Date (late
edition, 1929) the order of bids is proposal;
solo (five tricks); misere; abundance (nine
tricks) in suit not turned as trumps; abundance
in trumps; open misere; abundance declaree (13
tricks) in any suit. But what is mostly played
in Australasia under the name of solo is a
variety of “bid whist.” No trump is turned
up, and bidding proceeds by auction, suits
being of equal value and successful declarer
nominating trumps after bidding has finished.
Order of calls is proposal; five tricks, six,
seven-; eight; misere; abundance; open misere,
abundance declaree. In some schools trumps
are turned up and a bid of five, six, seven, eight
or more in trumps takes precedence of equal
bids in any other suit. In this case every
player must nominate the suit m which he bids.
There is no standard authority for these varia-
tions.
(1) Why are 1914 Australian pennies so rarely
seen in circulation ? . (2) Are returned sol diets
badges made from them ? (3) Have pennies
of that date any special value? —9443.
(1) i n 1914 only 720,000 Australian pence
were struck, and as 80,943,120 Australian pence
had been issued to the end of 1932, and were
circulated in addition to large numbeis or
British pence (recently withdrawn to obtain
the benefit of exchange), the proportion of 1914
pence to the whole amount is less than 1 p.c.

say, “A Country Girl” ? Do you think Rom-
berg’s works will live as long ?— 9481.
(1) In details, methods of collaboration are
almost as various as the number of librettists
and musical composers involved. General prac-
tice is to write music for the libretto, but in
many instances words have been fitted to tunes.
Usually librettist and composer accept sugges-
tions from each other, from the management
and from the artists who are to perform their
play. (2) Usually by the librettist, with some
assistance from the leading comedians of th
production. (3) Sigmund Romberg « Hun
garian, born 1887. First successfu l composea
staee music in 1913; has wholly or partly
composed over 50 musical plays, revues, an
operettas. Oscar Hammerstein (American)
wrote his first musical play in 1919. Was pari
writer of librettos for Romberg s successes Th
Desert Song” and “The New Moon, Friml s
“Rose Marie” and many other musical plays,
including “Music in the Air. (4) Not muc

joints and vertical irregularities in the track
by automatically registering on a chart all
faults and marking the rails at the exact spot,
enabling not only defects whichmaybemissed
bY ordinary inspection to be detected, but pe
mitting the maintenance men to remedy faulty
exactly where necessary. It also imposes a
check on the maintenance men.

(1) Probable cause of excessive plate current
in the first valve of a resistance-capacity coupled
amplifier? Bias and H.T. voltages are L 7l °rmaF
and the valve has been replaced. (2) Remedy .
9474
(1) Probably due to a leaky coupling con-
denser connecting the plate circuit of the detec-
tor to the grid of the valve in question. Quite
a small leakage will seriously impair the work-
ing of the valve, and when a high-resistance
arid leak is used a positive potential will be
applied to the grid which may cancel out the
normal negative bias. (2) Replace the leaky
condenser by a mica dielectric condenser ot
known quality, and of the same capacity as
the original. . . ,

tions of detection and automatic volume con-
trol while the triode portion of the combina-
tion may be used as a low-frequency amplifier
(3) This is a duplex-diode triode with small
6-pin base (grid connection on top of the valve).
The heater voltage is 2.5, heater current 1 amp.,
plate voltage 250 max., grid voltage 20.

BUSINESS, ROBBERY
“Tante”: France has opened a lordly
Government pawnshop in Paris for cars
only. Two thousand vehicles can he
accommodated and all necessary mea-
sures are taken to keep them in good
order, including warming of the building
in winter and recharging of accumulators.
You pay 9 p.c. p.a. for accommodation, in-
cluding maintenance costs, and six months
are allowed for redemption, with renewal
on the payment of interest. If the pledge
has to be sold the owner receives all the
price over and above interest and sale
costs.
* * * *
“Latex”: A development which prom-
ises to do the rubber trade a good turn
is the demand in Britain for pneumatic
tyres on horse-drawn vehicles. It applies
not only to vehicles for town use,
but to farm carts, and wheelwrights
all oyer the country are working on the
new jobs. With farm carts and waggons
it is found that a load half as big again
can be hauled without distress to the
horses, rough ground is easily traversed
and there are no ruts or damage of grass
or crops. In the towns, milk, bread and
aerated-water carts as well as coal-
waggons are being adapted to the pneu-
matic. In addition to saving the horse,
maintenance charges are reduced, loads
are protected from jolting and compara-
tive silence is achieved.
* * * *
“Wynnum”: Queensland, which seems
to be always ready to try anything new,
is cottoning on to the notion of growing
avocado pears, a pugilist from California,
who grows them himself, having strongly
recommended them. The avocado is a
semi-tropical fruit, and is highly popular
in the U.S.A. A lot of money has been
sunk in Queensland by orchardists experi-
menting with fancy fruits. Outside the
mango, pineapple and banana, all im-
ported but acclimatised products, few
have proved successful, and even the
banana’s foundations are shaken when-
ever there is any mention of permitting
the introduction of an overseas variety.
* * * *
“Chassis”: One of the problems of
motor-car manufacture is waste of
material. An English co. with a very up-
to-date plant and methods has recently
been going into the matter. It finds that
only 26 p.c. of the materials utilised by
the plant is delivered to the customer,
the balance being waste.
* * * *
“Ped.”: Queensland’s Education De-
partment makes a specialty of encourag-
ing school gardens and farmlets. At
Maroochy River the youngsters go in
for cane-growing on a small scale, and
one source of income is selling young
plants to local cane-farmers, who buy
readily. This season’s crop was recently
harvested and sent to the mill. The four
tons of cane returned £8 10s. and this is
to go into the buying of fertiliser for
next year—fertiliser and sporting material.
* * * ■ *
“Taster”: The marked rise in tea
prices has proved a good thing for the
Netherland Indies growers. Indian prices
are far above normal; Ceylon’s have
reached almost prohibitive heights. The
result has been that Australian buyers
have been rushing the Javan product.
Prices have advanced there until common
teas are now bringing the price of
medium grades. Still they offer better
returns for the money than Ceylon or
India, and most of Australia’s stocks for
the coming year will hail this time from
Java.
* # * *
“Attock”: A journey of 6000 miles in
a car without a drop of petrol has been
completed by Colonel Noel, of the N.-W.
Frontier Province of India, from Quetta
to Paris. He travelled in a Rolls-Royce
fitted with a plant producing gas from
charcoal. The object of the trip was to
popularise the use of charcoal-gas fuel
in n.-w. India, where charcoal burning
is a considerable native industry. It is
an old Australian industry, too, and with
the demand for fuel on farms it is being
revived in a small way.
* * * *
“L. R. Russ”: At the instance of E.
H. F. Swain, late chairman of the
Forestry Board, the Queensland Forestry
people have been making pipes out of
various Queensland timbers and giving
them away to responsible persons on the
understanding that they are to be re-
turned with a report. In all, about 300
pipes were made out of 33 different tim-
bers ; three timbers have proved suitable
both commercially and from the smokers’
point of view: brigalow, Burdekin plum
and satinay. Satinay grows up to 25
feet in girth, and every part of it can be
used. It is estimated that one tree would
supply the State’s pipe needs for 12
months.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
To the beat of dancing feet, to the
blare of the saxophone, to a city that
was a multicolored web of carnival
streamers and gaudy with scintillating
lights, the little New Year opened its eyes.
Merriment had been in the air since
Saturday night. It had perched quietly
through Sunday, only to dart out at mid-
night a more brilliant bird of Paradise
than ever. The Royal Motor Yacht Club
held its revels on Saturday night. This pol-
ished off Pittwater regatta, and nearly
300 guests turned up at the Broken Bay
clubhouse. Searchlights, a haggis and a
Highland band added atmosphere. The
Yacht Squadron at Kirribilli, being a
conservative old business, held its “do”
before the Sabbath eve, and was giddy
with flower and bunting.
The Killara and the Rose Bay Golf
Clubs echoed to the exchange of good
wishes among the members on the night
before New Year’s Eve ; and the floor of
every ballroom in the city was kept run-
ning hot with the non-stop glide of merry
feet. Organiser Norah Frost can feel
proud of the Hollywood party for the
benefit of the Deaf and Dumb and the
Blind children. But Nock and Kirby’s
Pompadour ballroom had the excitement
of landing the new Mayor and his lady.
They broadcast their New Year greetings
from the “All Through the Night” ball in
aid of Prince Alfred’s. This started at
11.45 p.m. on New Year’s Eve and ran
its course merrily till 5.45 on New Year’s
morn.
“Beaches and Belles” would describe
Sydney’s Christmas as aptly as could be.
Balmoral, Bronte and Bondi, Manly and
Maroubra flung out a beckoning sun-
browned arm, the sky was a speckless
blue, the air warm and soft as silk; so
the city with one accord reached for its
bathers. By midday it looked as though
not another foot could be squeezed on
to the sands gay with their beach
umbrellas, their little tents, tall and short
girls running free in suits of emerald,
sapphire and ruby. A fine spinal display
was given by some of the lasses, and
a striking jester effect was gained by one
young woman, whose suit was striped
black and white down one side and was
plain black down the other. To balance
this there were the girls who promenaded
in slacks and satin blouses, high at the
collar and long of sleeve. One red and
one white example of this style stood
shining in the sun just where the pale-
green waves flung their lacy fringes on the
wet sands.
Into the big pool on Manly’s harbor
front thousands waded. Small girls and
boys had their middles adorned with
rubber tyres in gaudy colorings ; some of
these were in the shape of fishes, finned
and all. The kiddies bobbed about in the
water or popped about the seething sands
under the eyes of mothers in shorts, in
longs, or in gay skirts. One girl who
had tried the slippery-dip, the rolling logs
and the spinning floats of the much-
advertised pool finally called it a day, and
reappeared on the sands clad in a white
blouse and a pair of red shorts, the
modern version of grandma’s bit of red
flannel.
All the Dante Alighieri Society’s pot-
tery jugs were needed to hold the cock-
tails for the party to the new Chief Jus-
tice and his lady. The former needed no
introduction to the company in the inti-
mate little clubrooms tucked behind
Hunter-street, for the name of F. R.
Jordan is among the early members. The
blue of hydrangea and hippeastrum was
massed in great brown jars ; the greetings
and congratulations were as so much
verbal confetti flung into the air ; every-
body was lighthearted, and president Dr.
Baccarini and Mrs. Baccarini received the
guests of honor. Mrs. Jordan’s coat was
navy in hue and had cape sleeves ; the
frock beneath was patterned in navy and
red. Navy was popular, too, with Mrs.
Fiaschi and Mrs. David Maughan.
Italy’s Consular Ferrantes dropped in, the
Marchesa wearing black-and-white pat-
terned chiffons under a black tailored
coat.
A marriage that interested older jour-
nalistic Sydney was that of “Covey”
(Eleanor), youngest child of the late
Ernest Blackwell, to Stewart Earlam.
Ernest, a young, well-known newspaper-
man of the ’nineties, surprised his world
by laying down a brilliant and graceful
pen in favor of the dentist’s forceps.
These he wielded expertly in Macquarie-
street till his death. Covey, who, after
graduating in economics at Sydney Uni.,
held a job that had to do with statistics
in Canberra, did not economise unduly
over her wedding raiment. This was a
picturesque confection of creamy satin
and tulle. Orange-blossom wreathed her
veil, and pale yellow roses bloomed in
her bouquet. Helen Scott, of Canberra,
’maided -in blue chiffons patterned in
white. The ’groom’s father is superin-
tendent of the N.S.W. Institution for the
Deaf and Dumb and the Blind at Dar-
lington. Christ Church at Lavender Bay
blessed the bride’s change of name ; the
cake was cut at Studley Royal, Kirri-
billi.
Marguerite Shirlaw lives in one of the
picturesque fastnesses of Castlecrag, and
thence looks out at the blue lotos which
is Middle Harbor, musing on the . drama.
Mrs. Shirlaw is a keen student thereof,
and her series of lectures, just concluded,
showed keen insight and industrious re-
search. Mrs. Shirlaw, who before com-
ing to Sydney was a book reviewer for
the Madras “Mail,” goes off to England
and Europe to make a study at close
range of the new movements in the
theatre ; perhaps, too, to find a market for
some of the plays she has written. One
of these, “A Limitless Risk,” was pro-
duced at the Savoy two years ago. This
photograph by Monte Luke shows the
lady made up for the part of Vera in
Rodney Ackland’s “Strange Orchestra.”
White frocks and wide hats were first
favorites with this Letter at Randwick on
Boxing Day. There were infinitesimal
head coverings with tiny peaked brims,
and angel-skin toques by the dozen, but
before the sunny afternoon was half-way
through the wearers of the latter had
noses more burned than angels would
care for. Randwick was beautiful. After
the rain of the day before the grass shone
like green satin, the flowers turned up
brilliant faces, a cool breeze brought
blessed relief to the stands where every-
body sits and to the flat where everybody
is upright. The frocks were as gay as
the day. All the colors that Nature has
evolved were repeated in the patterned
silks, the crisp cottons, the buoyant organ-
dies, and everywhere were short sleeves
and bare arms in true Sydney summer
style.
Down from Narrandera to see the New
Year in came Father Pat Hartigan, who
is known throughout Australia as John
O’Brien, author of “The Boree Log.”
Father Pat in his college days at Manly
was a Bulletin contributor, and he still
has the answer, printed in letters a foot
high, or so they seemed to him at the
time, on his first quest for immortality.
This handsome girl is Marie Benti-
voglio, Doctor of Philosophy. She is on
the staff of the Teachers’ College within
Sydney Uni., and is president of the Uni-
versity Women Graduates’ Association.
In addition to her intellectual activities,
Marie leads a busy social life and is keen
on dancing and tennis. She takes a vital
interest in the affairs of the Italian com-
munity in Sydney, and is a member of the
Advisory Council of the Dante Alighieri
Society. The National Council of Women
and the Geographical Society are two
other movements to which this vivid
daughter of Italy devotes part of her time.

Just as this Letter was dipping into its
rouge pot to say Happy New Year to the
world, Scots wha hae were flashing the
family cairngorm and flying sprigs of
white heather out at the Showground. Stal-
wart pipers were trying out a few prelimi-
nary skirls behind the stands, and small
girls completely armored in silver medals,
the outward and visible sign of their
prowess in their national dances, were
stepping delicately though with apparent
recklessness in the sword dance and the
Highland fling. Strong men were putting
the shot and throwing the caber. The
clans were out in force and the tartans
flew a brave greeting to 1934. Perhaps
one reason, apart from their sterling
qualities, why as a nation we so treasure
the Scots is that they are the only people
of the U.K. who have a racial dress that
looks like a fancy costume.
Tom Moates came from the wilds of
Papua to greet his bride-elect at Christ-
mastime. The girl in the case is Gwen
Hertford, who has a nimbus of red-gold
hair and is the youngest daughter of Mrs.
Wilson Allan, of The Dell, Surrey, Eng-
land. Gwen has been for several months
the guest of Tom’s mother, and to show
their indifference to superstition the
young pair were married last Friday. It
was a quiet family wedding because of
the recent illness of Tom’s father. The
honeymoon is being spent at the bride-
groom’s parents’ apple and cherry orch-
ard at Penrose.
The slim and very fair Patricia Nelson,
who came over from her home in Hawkes
Bay, Maoriland, last April, became Mrs.
Don McLarty last Thursday in St.
James’s, King-street. Patricia is a member
of the “Tout Paris” company now
appearing at the Criterion, and the groom
is a son of the D. S. McLartys, of Silver-
pines, Bundura, N.S.W. Small diamon
buttons glittered like a superior waterfall
down the back of the wedding garment,
which was of ivory velvet, cut high at
the neckline. The skirt was very long
and fitting, and ended in the merest
whisper of a train. Jean Pearce,
Adelaide, ’maided; healths were drunk
at Romano’s. The pair went honey-
mooning to Maoriland. On her return
Mrs. McLarty will take up her part once
more in “Tout Paris.”
Earl Beauchamp’s Christmas card for
1933 was a reproduction of one of the
paintings in his English home, Madres-
field Court. This is the third year the
Earl has chosen a reproduction of a
family treasure to carry his greetings.
For 1932 it was a Romney portrait of
Gibbon in a cherry-red coat; for 1933
it is the portrait of an ancestress,
Catherine Denne, a handsome creature
whose sloe-black eyes look out from
under level brows. Her piled-up fair (or
powdered) curls are bound with a wide
ribbon. There are greeny shadows
splashed on the cream muslin of her
frock, which is finished with a fichu.
There are no jewels on the firm young
throat. Catherine Denne lived from
1753-1839, and was painted in her beauty
by William Beechy.
Edith M. Crane, just appointed matron
of the new Ryde District Soldiers
Memorial Hospital, is no stranger to Tas-
mania or West Maitland. In the Apple
Isle she was matron of the Devon Hos-
pital, Latrobe, which has 120 beds and a
daily average of over 100 patients. Miss
Crane was for some time deputy-matron
of the general hospital at West Maitland.
The new Ryde hospital will be opened
early this year.
H.M.A.S. Penguin was original, and
staged its Christmas party a few days
after the twenty-fifth. However, the 180
kiddies who were the guests made no
complaints. Noisily they hailed the arrival
of Santa Claus from the depths of the sea
complete in a diver s outfit. There were
a richly-laden tree, and slippery slides
and Micky Mouses, and a hundred and
one entertainments for the lucky young-
sters aboard, and everybody was glad
that even grown-ups believed that ice-
cream was good for you, because the
supplies of the cold delicacy were for
once gloriously adequate to the demand.
Sydney is listening to the band ; it is
also crowding into the Town Hall to get
an eyeful. Forty-five men whose bright
red tunics glitter with gold, whose navy
trousers are braided in red, whose brass
instruments dazzlingly throw back the
rays of the two floodlights above them,
fill the stage with light and cheerfulness.
“Ah,” sighs Major Conder, who is proud
that these musicians have been picked
from every State in Australia, “but wait
till I can get a built-up platform where
the drums can stand high in their pride! ”
The band is the A.B.C. Military Band,
and Captain Adkins is its conductor. The
captain does not sport a tunic. He wears
navy, the front of the coat heavily looped
in gold. There is nothing wrong with his
waistline, which is slim in comparison
with his wide shoulders. His gold-and-
red belt is finished off with gold
tassels. Altogether very commanding,
and you don’t wonder that the drums
and the bassoons and all the loopy brass
things are a bit in awe of him, and obey
the slightest wave of his hand.
Why should the shops make fish of one
and red herring of another? Walking
through a city store after Boxing Day
this Letter saw a sign “Gifts, Half-price” ;
and if that isn’t pandering to the Scotties,
who have their big rejoicing at New Year,
what is?

Chatter
On Christmas morning Melbourne
opened an eye to the tune of carols, both
eyes to the shriek of tin-whistles and the
clatter of new toys, and bounded out of
bed and on to the beach with its off-
spring to admire the new canoe in action.
Then it got into shorts or slacks, for
everything promised a fine, warm Christ-
mas ; the sun shone and there arose an
aroma of turkey and plum pudding. In
the middle of the afternoon there was a
sudden clap of thunder, the heavens
opened and down came 160 points of rain
in an hour. Woebegone picnickers
huddled together with chattering teeth ;
in the city a torrent raced down Eliza-
beth-street. A damsel in summery garb,
marooned most of the afternoon in a
draughty doorway, peeled off her shoes
and stockings, wrapped her hat in a news-
paper and waded to a tram. Christmas
celebrants going home in the sma’ hours
couldn’t cope with an engine gone dead
in the middle of a lake where a road
should have been, so they curled up and
slept where they were. Youngsters who
hadn’t gone to bed with Santa Claus’s
gifts held tight in both arms wept to
see the new teddy bear float through the
window with the furniture. Treasured
odds and ends were ruined and people
m the vicinity of Moonee Ponds Creek
had a sad, cold and hungry finish to their
Christmas.
Almost as suddenly as the mutton-birds
swoop down upon Phillip Island does
society appear annually in its haunts
along the bay beaches. Here the gossip
sleuth with her offsider of the camera
runs her quarry to earth during the
summer months. There are no make-
shift picnics for the rich. They swim a
little, flirt a little, play golf, tennis and
quite a lot of bridge, and, of course,
cocktail bar, super radio and complete
house staff migrate with them. The
family people get the skin burnt off their
noses in smart and otherwise beach gar-
ments, while the young things with livings
to earn but for two weeks in the year
swarm into boarding-houses, where they
dance all night to a gramophone and vie
with one another over the depth of their
tan.
Though a chilly wind swept the stands
at Caulfield there were a few visions
determined to show off their Henley
frocks. One damsel in full sail of white
organdie was anchored to the arm of an
adoring swain—her lacquered toes, un-
trammelled by stockings, defied the cold
through apertures in her little red shoes,
and her curls bobbed, for she carried a
ribboned hat on her wrist in the rustic
manner. Mrs. Ben Chaffey, in holly red
and a silver fox, chatted in the committee
box with Mrs. Rogers Thomson—her
snow-white hair thrown into relief by
her black tailored suit. Mrs. A. V. His-
kens had a shagbark blouse for her
black suit. Mrs. Len Buxton in a trim
white suit and knot of spotted navy
for scarf, with her mother, Mrs. Neun-
hoffer, hurried to the saddling paddock to
proudly pat Mrs. Buxton’s Heros —he
won the Christmas Handicap. Mrs.' A.
V. Kewney covered her printed frock
with a black coat. Mrs. Norman Robin-
son watched her fancied gallopers through
an eye-veil nipped to a wee black hat.
Mrs. Warwick Armstrong did her punting
in a tweed coat. A shimmery turnout of
black lacquered satin came in for a good
deal of comment.
Round about Christmas those vivacious
sisters Mrs. Russell-Jackson and Mrs.
Dyson give a party with the wives of
Japanese officials as first invited guests.
This year warm sunshine filled the garden
of the old St. Kilda homestead within
which little Japanese dolls, Chinese dolls
and solemn Indians with papooses on
their backs stood at attention under the
eyes of South Sea Island gods and an
armory of Polynesian weapons. The
Japanese guests, some small, others
talhsh, and every one slender and chic,
were in up-to-date European garb ; the
only man among them was Mr. Kawa-
nur j‘ Tea-time went on and on, and
gradually merged into New Year drinks
in the region of the dinner hour. Mrs.
Russell-J ackson’s Nile-green organza
burst into black organdie sleeves, and
Mrs. Dyson was all starched and sum-
mery in white organdie. Dr. and Mrs
Jona were there, and Dr. Nihill; Mrs.
Fleming Dunstan sang, and so did Edith
Harrhy, who generously trotted out her
star turn about the King and the butter.
Mrs. Edward Stevens played and Louie
Dunne got across with her two “Ifs.”
In the crowd were Mrs. Esmond Kiernan,
Mrs. F. J. Rae, the E. P. Chinnery couple
and General Wisdom—he with a twinkle
in his eye for all his old friends-.
To do honor to Betty Ridley the
Osborne Fairbairns put on one of the
week’s few dances at Skipton. The
hostess received her town and country
guests in chiffons which caught the light
with a golden glow, and white satin clad
the guest of honor. The Geoffrey Streets
were there and the Keith Calverts, the
Theo and the Arthur Beggs couples, and
some younger ones like Claudia Palmer,
Cecile Mann, Betty Caddy and Shirley
Ross. Among the menfolk were lan
and Jim Mann, Alec and Geoff Russell,
Roger Henderson and Trevor Clarke.
Miss Ridley goes back to England in
April.
The first inter-State duplicate contract
bridge match was held last week in Syd-
ney. Below is a Lafayette portrait of
Mrs. Norman McCance, a heroine of the
Victorian team, which, though van-
quished, kept its flag flying until the last
hand. The McCance couple played to-
gether, their team mates being Mrs. R.
Chisholm and H. D. Joske—the N.S.W.
quartette were all men. It takes the
stuff of which champions are made to
play 120 hands under the critical eyes of
spectators kept at bay by barriers, but
the two women executed brilliant coups
and soared up into the slam zone with-
out the flicker of an eyelid. Mrs.
McCance is popular among Melbourne
contract players. She’s always a good
sport, wins generously, loses with a smile
and is modest over the superiority of
her play and her bridge instinct.
The flavor of Scotland permeated the
marriage of Margaret Isobel Mackay and
Henry Mackay Burrell; he’s a naval
officer on the H.M.A.S. Stuart. The
bridal gown, a simplicity of angel-skin
crepe, over which swept a foam of tulle
veil, was merged with cream and gold
frangipanni in a bouquet which perfumed
the quiet shadow of Scots Church and
afterwards the vicinity of the wedding
cake at Grosvenor. Mrs. Brian Jones
and Helen Macgregor carried out the
duties of attendants in tucked-and-frilled
pink ninon and posies of rosebuds.
Matrimonial intentions have been
announced by Prudence Staughton and
James Holden, of the motor-body clan
—his parents hail from Warrawee, N.S.W.
The Staughton family tree grows in the
Western District. The beautiful Prudence,
who is one of Melbourne’s most-talked-of
girls, embarked a few months ago upon
the venture of selling misses’ frocks in a
big city store.
Here is wizard of the ’cello David
Sisserman, originator of a new movement
to Melbourne, the bringing of chamber
music into private houses. Sisserman
adores his art. He is happiest when
giving people pleasure through his music ;
in his make-up are plenty of good cheer,
a sense of humor and a complete lack of
monetary values. By birth, he is Russian,
and somehow came intact through the
Revolution, though a bout of rheumatic
fever in a freezing Bolshie gaol nearly de-
prived him of the use of his right arm.
He first visited this country with his
beloved Pavlova, and remained on the
request of the Albert-street Con. and a
host of admirers. In 1932 he snatched
a trip to England—it is there that his
family live, and many friends, who posted
David a bulging Christmas mail. The
cellist has a soft spot for his Sisserman
Quartet and the Amati Trio. Marietta
made the picture.
Trainers of young minds Miss E. M.
Ellis, from P.L.C., and Tintern’s Miss M.
M. Gibson haven’t had enough of foreign
travel. Just back from abroad, they gave
Melbourne a fleeting glance, then hied
them off to the Barrier Reef. Another
P.L.C. dominie, Miss A. G. Cooke, is
joining them among the turtles and coral.
The West continues to enjoy its
summer:
The mercury did a rapid climb in Perth for
Derby Day, but dropped down a bit for the
last couple of races, making it possible to wear
dust coats on the homeward journey The
frocking wasn’t as Derbyish as usual, but Mrs
Doy Forrest’s cut-pineapple cobwebs and velvet-
swathed green Plantagenet hat brought up the
average. Mrs. Langlois Lefroy’s ruched sleeved
cerise georgettes caught the eye; the apple-green
scalloped edge of Mrs. Alec Williams’s lace
hat shaded a froth of lacy cream net; Joy
Lathlain’s hand-embroidered white voile was
topped by an aertex wheel; Mrs. Bill Crom-
mellin’s white fireman’s helmet matched the
clusters of dollar spots on her scarlet silks, and
a horned ornament sprouted from the black
lacquer crown of Mrs. Ambrose’s white balli-
buntal.
For three stifling evenings “The Merry Wives
of Windsor” sported merrily on the green sward
’twixt the Supreme Court and the Esplanade,
and exited behind growing laurel-trees and
pampas grass. A smart page kept up old
traditions with placards advising the character
of the scenes. Molly Ick drew on much experi-
ence with the Wilkie co. in producing.
Members of the Pleiades Club went back to
childhood with a maximum of vim and noise
at their Christmas party. During pauses for
breath Gwen Bickford put on “Law and
Order,” and Marjorie Butler produced and
appeared in “G. for George.” Dorothy Flem-
ing trained “Five Inefficients” to give a stormy-
weather ballet, and Jean Cohn rode down from
Bangor. Dorothy Fallows headed the com-
mittee responsible for the riot.
The Ernest Lee Steeres dismantled their bil-
liard-table, removed the dining-room furniture,
erected a marquee on the tennis court for
supper, and called in an orchestra to play
dance music in honor of son Ernest’s arrival
at voting age. The hostess’s port-wine Chan-
tilly swept the mosaic floor of the entrance hall,
and daughter Muriel’s summer-sky flamisol,
Tudor-sleeved, harmonised with the hydrangeas
in the drawing-room.
Mrs. E. B. Sinclair, set about with ruched
navy blue and white georgettes, installed a'
profusion of gladioli, petunias and the like in
the Mayoress’s room at the Council Chambers,
and poured tea to a mass of Christmas well-
wishers. Daughter Marjorie, in pin-spot white
silk pique, dashed about with cakes, and sisters
Mrs. Brockman and Maud and Katie Franklin
assisted.
With the help of Jean Gough, some 60
pupils and elaborate stage settings, Estelle
Anderson converted “Alice in Wonderland”
into a delightful pantomime at Hoyt’s Regent
Theatre. Mr. T. Phillips arranged the music
for the maze of ballets through which Ronnie
le Page, as the White Rabbit, led a bewildered
Alice, in the person of Toto Wilson.
Rows and rows of pink cannas swayed with
the gentle breeze which mitigated the heat on
Railway Stakes Day. Mrs. Stanley Burridge’s
blue-sprigged white georgettes frou-froued from
the shoulders and fell in folds to a flare of
white organdie; Mrs. Cockram’s chocolate
flamisol worked its way from the ground up
to a frilled yoke and sleeves of fine yellow and
brown checks; white leaves, appliqued into pat-
terns, fell from shoulder to elbow and around
the corsage of Dot Cadd’s navy georgettes; a
deep slit in the back of a yellow diagonal-
striped frock revealed a skin so sun-tanned that
only careful inspection showed where the brown
satin sash left off and the back began; Elsie
Paxton’s mushroom Kasha silk was zigzagged
with wide decorative faggoting; a parasol of
delicate ruching shaded Vi Holmes’s autumn-
tinted ninons, and Mrs. Roy Mitchell’s navy
blues were yoked and angel-sleeved with gof-
fered white chiffon.
“Johnnie” Lathlain, daughter of knight Wil-
liam and his lady, has given her promise to
Kim Male, a member of the large clan from
Broome.
Adelaide greets Santa Claus:
South Aus. enjoyed what we call “an old-
fashioned Christmas,” which means the tem-
perature of a baker’s oven. Christmas Eve
meant record trading for Adelaide shops, and
the seaside resorts were (and still are) crowded.
The sideshows and the teashops by the sad
sea waves are giving their cash registers brisk
exercise after eight lean years. Every family
brings down a gay beach ball and a life-size
rubber horse or cow, and the sea is dotted
with fearsome animals.
Turkey and plum pudding seem conducive
to engagements. The clicking of Joan, only
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John Tennant, Prin-
cess Royal, Burra, and Dr. Brian Swift was
celebrated by a dinner at the Hotel St. Vincent,
Glenelg, when Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Tennant
entertained a number of guests. Macpherson
Knox and Deborah, youngest daughter of the
Hackett lady, North Adelaide, are another
couple who look forward to wedding bells.
The Port Adelaide R.C. has never seen such
an attendance at Cheltenham as turned out on
Boxing Day. The presence of the bookmakers
was responsible. Hundreds of Adelaide folk
were seeing them for the first time, and -the
huge beach umbrellas beneath which they dia
business added gaiety to the scene. Dr. A. V.
Benson (chairman) and his wife entertained a
huge horde of guests at afternoon-tea. Mrs.
Benson was gowned in a white, yellow and
grey figured crepe de Chine, worn with a white
hat. Linen frocks, both plaid and plain, were
very popular.
A little budget from the Speck:
Hobart emptied itself for the Christmas holi-
days, and seaside and country resorts filled
up accordingly. The completed road from the
north to the south end of the Great Lake
brought heavy booking to both accommodation-
houses, and the fish are likely to have a bad
time for the next few weeks.
The two Frank Parsons girls, Sheila and
Anita, with their brother Douglas, gave a very
cheery dance at their Pelham home. Car-
loads of bright young things ran up from town,
and country friends turned up in force. Guests
danced in the hall, sitting-room and closed-in
verandah, and supper was served in the dining-
room. Decorations were pink, with masses of
sweet-peas and London pride.
The weather wasn’t kind for Mrs. Potter’s
garden fete in aid of the Bush Nursing fund
at Newstead House, Launceston. Lady Clark
motored up to open the show, accompanied
by Miss Macdonald. Tea tables had to be
hurriedly removed from the lawn to the shelter
of the verandah. Racing competitions pro-
vided a lot of fun, and bridge was played in
the lounge.
Lady Clark handed out the children’s prizes
at the Blind, Deaf and Dumb Institution. The
Lewis lady and the Mayoress were there, too.
President Dr. E. Morris Miller and Mrs. Miller
received the guests. The youngsters gave
demonstrations of musical ability and lip-read-
ing, and the committee provided a toothsome
tea in the main building.
Jean, youngest daughter of the Rev. G. B.
and Mrs. Murphy, Dynyrne-road, and Geoff,
younger son of the Ernest Sorells, announce
their engagement. ,
Nancy McPhee, daughter of the Premier, is
taking up Law, and will be the first feminine
LL.B. to be admitted as a barrister. She has
finished her time with Butler, Mclntyre and
Butler, and gets her sheepskin and hood at
the next commem. of Tas. University.
Alys Jones was hostess of a sizable tea-
party at Hadley’s as a welcome-home to the
Jones lady and Mrs. Tom Fitzgerald, who have
been touring Europe.
The Russell Ibbotts, Strathbarton, and the
J. E. Thorps have done a bit of shuffling in
homes, the Ibbotts having bought Derwent
Haven for a town house and the Thorps settled
in at Jutland, Newtown, formerly the home of
the Hon. W. B. Propsting.
Mrs. Eric Stopps and her small family have
arrived from Norfolk Island to spend the hot
season with Mrs. Stopps’s parents, the S. T.
Chancellors, in Fitzroy-place.
The James Murrays have returned after some
months spent in England.
The Frank Gummows are settled at Ferntree
for the summer after their trip abroad.
The Allardyce lady spent a few days with
Mrs. J. G. Mitchell at Elsmere, Jericho, before
leaving the Speck for Melbourne, where she
boards the Oronsay for Fogland.

The Government of the United Pro-
vinces (India) has issued a report on
municipal administration within its
borders which falls with a familiar note
on Sydney ears. The year’s story, the
report says, has been one of party, in-
trigue, interminable wrangles, unblushing
jobbery and injustice in connection with
contracts and appointments to jobs, reck-
less irresponsibility and wasteful extrava-
gance. It only needs a reference to “four
fifties” or to large sums of mysterious
money kept under loose boards on stair-
cases to make us realise that there isn t
so much difference, after all, between
East and West.

The Nazi Governor of Berlin lately in-
formed 10,000 steel-helmets (presumably
with brains underneath) that Germany
must get back the colonies it governed
so well and which were so essential to
its trade. This is a good example of
national myopia. Through looking at
Britain, whose colonies and dominions
absorb two-fifths of its trade, the pre*
war Germans got it into their heads that
without an empire the Fatherland would
perish. The notion has stuck, although
at no time did Germany sell to its own
colonies more than half of one per cent,
of its exports.

“Thanatos”: Britain is growing restive
at the tremendous toll of lives taken by
motor-cars since the speed limit was
abolished a couple of years ago. Recent
statistics show that in the past 15 years
there have been two million casualties
and 75,000 deaths, the rate haying in-
creased out of all proportion since the
check on fast driving was removed. In
the House of Commons the Minister for
Transport said that a speed limit would
probably be reimposed, and that the
practice prevailing in some other coun-
tries —notably in some of the Australian
States —of cancelling the licenses of
drivers involved in accidents might be
adopteid.

“Baffy”: Britain has discovered yet
another blind golfer. His name is Oxen-
ham and he is rated on a 20 handicap by
his club, West Hove. His caddie tees up
for him and gives him the direction or
the hole, and, when on the green, tells
him the distance of the tin, at the same
time rattling the flag-iron in it. Recently
Oxenham went out in 47 and back in
42. This suggests that a lot of our Syd-
ney players might considerably improve
their game if they could only get rid of
their eyesight.

“Carnoustie”: Bobby Jones, who, like
most really great golfers, scouts style
conventions, has been commenting on the

catch the finish. Jones the

which he wore throughout the match.

and an exasperated associate brigade is
still busy thinking up a riposte.


The Development of Dibsby.
BY M. G. SKIPPPER.
DIBSBY was an average student. He
got through his medical course with
difficulty. He had a faculty for
quickly acquiring book-knowledge, that
was all. But one of the professors he
sat under, a dim old fellow with blank,
unseeing eyes, used often, when asked a
question, to answer like this: “Don’t
ask me! I’m not an encyclopaedia. I’m
a specialist.” This made a deep impres-
sion on Dibsby.
Dibsby went through the usual routine
of walking hospitals in the wake of
specialists who were impatient and in-
tolerant of his ignorance. Then he
bought a practice in an industrial suburb
with a large number of unemployed. It
was not long before the work, largely
unpaid, of a general practitioner irked
him. One day a brother medico, to
whom he had communicated his bore-
dom, said “Why don’t you specialise
like me, you idiot!”
Dibsby remembered the professor. He
thought of first one department of medi-
cine and then another. Finally he hit on
hay fever. Most of his friends sneezed,
his patients usually had catarrh in one or
other of its forms, and he himself was a
martyr to the complaint. He rapidly
acquired all the available knowledge on
the subject, learning to his delight that
it required no great surgical skill and
that it was cleaner and more elegant
than delivering workers’ babies in the
middle of the night. But he was a con-
scientious man, and to make himself
thoroughly competent he sold his practice
and spent a year in Vienna under the
greatest hay-fever expert in the world,
who suffered from the complaint himself
distressingly.
In due course Dibsby returned and
set up a brass plate in one of the city’s
principal thoroughfares. Among so
many others it looked insignificant and
patients came slowly ; but Dibsby joined
a leading club, and when one of his
patients complained of other troubles
besides catarrh he would send him
round to other specialists he had known
at “the Shop,” and after a while they
began to reciprocate. The newspapers,
too, got to hear of Dibsby’s system,
which was comparatively new. Each
year as the season approached when
their readers began sneezing all over the
country they would send reporters round
to get a story. He was a poor talker, but
they supplied the imagination.
“From the advent of spring right up
Christmas,” he would be made to say,
“Nature becomes possessed of a malig-
nant desire to make humanity miserable.
Trees of every imaginable variety, dozens
ot grasses, even the'apparently innocent
flowers which our wives affectionately
pin in our unsuspecting buttonholes,
maintain an incessant bombardment of
our membranes, and there is no escape,
even twenty miles out at sea. Some
membranes are more susceptible to one
thing, some to another.” Why some
membranes were not susceptible to any
would not be explained, but it was made
quite clear that science had a golden
remedy for this distressing malady.
Clients began to pour into Dibsby’s
consulting-rooms and Dibsby made
scratches on their arms like a tattooist
and inspected the blisters assiduously
from ten till five, telling the sufferers
they were the helpless sport of dahlias,
Cape weed, house dust or horse dander,
“He had put two moons in one picture,
and it was an acknowledged masterpiece.”
as the case might be. Then he would
pump into them the appropriate serum.
It was all so easy that before
long Dibsby experienced considerable
relief from his more pressing financial
worries, while his patients declared that
they too had experienced great relief,
though when next spring came round
they often began to sneeze as hard as
ever.
When his patients complained of any
other trouble Dibsby would remember
the professor and say, with a virtuous ex-
pression, “I am not an encyclopaedia. I
am a specialist.” Then he would send
them round to other specialists.
Dibsby did not doubt the value of his
work, but after a year or two he began
to be oppressed by its monotony. He
could do it with his eyes shut now. There
were no longer any surprises in it. When
some stout, idle woman full of boredom
and discontent told him she was sure she
would faint under the needle and im-
plored him to give her an anaesthetic, he
would feel a burning desire to strangle
her and would involuntarily give her a
harder jab than usual.
Sometimes he would stride about his
consulting-room swearing he would go
back to Vienna and study something
else ; then his eyes would fall on a pile of
unpaid bills.
He took to golf and joined two more
clubs without finding life less mono-
tonous or more meaningful. Then he
married. Mrs. Dibsby had been a
fellow-student at the university, where,
having a rich father, she had spent eleven
years doing arts. She liked mixing with
intellectual people, provided they were
“Noticed a young man who sat quietly
listening”
young. She talked constantly about art,
which she thought very important, though
she had done nothing herself except
write a one-act play. It had been
performed by amateurs and had been
reviewed in the social columns of only
one newspaper, although all the dramatic
critics had been invited ; this convinced
Dibsby that the critics were jealous of
originality.
Budding poets and youthful writers
liked talking to Mrs. Dibsby about what
they had done or would some day do, and
after such a conversation she would say,
“Isn’t he interesting?” without having
any clear idea of what had been said.
Nevertheless, she memorised enough of
what she heard to make up a jargon of
her own. Dibsby, after a day spent in-
jecting serum, found her talk enchanting.
They moved to a better house in a
more fashionable suburb. She began giv-
ing parties to the writers, at which Dibsby
sat silent, watching his wife admiringly.
If a writer, out of politeness, asked him
his opinion, he would shake his head
smilingly and remark “Like you, I .am a
specialist.” After the party Mrs. Dibsby
would look at her plump, rosy face in
the glass, pat her pale hair, and say
“Wasn’t it interesting?”
She started going to art shows.
Dibsby’s only acquaintance with paint-
ings had been as a suburban doctor
when, to avoid having to listen to people
talk about their ailments or for humani-
tarian reasons, he would affect to be
interested in their pictures.
“Do you think he will die?” a
woman would ask anxiously.
Instead of replying Dibsby would go
up to a picture hanging on the wall and
say “I like that; it’s a Mawmsley, isn’t
it?”
“Yes, it is nice, isn’t it? But a bit dark
in the left-hand corner, don’t you think?”
“Oh, don’t ask me,” Dibsby would say.
“I’m a doctor. No, he won’t die. He
will be all right.”
Later he had bought a few etchings
for his waiting-room in accordance with
professional precedent, but he never
looked at them. Now his wife’s capacity
for putting painters into all sorts of cate-
gories filled him with admiration. She
carefully read the notices of the art
critics, without observing that they con-
tradicted one another, and repeated their
opinions as her own; and the writers in-
variably respected them. She bought a
history of painting, some biographies and
a work on aesthetics which had been well
reviewed, and if a painting was praised
simultaneously by several critics she
would induce Dibsby to buy it.
Soon his house was full of pictures, but
when the writers asked him for an
opinion on them he would shake his head
and say “I know nothing about painting.
I’m a specialist.”
In a few years he had a comprehensive
collection of pictures by local painters,
and then he took Mrs. Dibsby on a trip
abroad, where they inspected all the Old
Masters mentioned in Baedeker. They
returned with half a dozen Worpens, and
this fact was communicated to newspaper
readers; so he sent for some more.
Presently, whenever Dibsby’s name was
mentioned in the papers, the paragraphist
would conclude with “Dr. Dibsby, as well
as being one of our leading medical
specialists, has the finest collection of
Worpens in the Southern
Hemisphere.”
Worpen died, however,
and, with a rapidity which
astonished Mrs. Dibsby,
was completely forgotten.
She was seriously perturbed
one day when she read that
a sale of his works in
London had not drawn a
bid ; and she read in an art
magazine a contemptuous
reference to the dead
painter, together with some very lauda-
tory remarks about a new Scottish
painter named Mactavish. This infuriated
her.
Within the next few years, however,
Dibsby, under the guidance of his wife,
acquired a representative collection of
Mactavishes, and when he was mentioned
in the papers the paragraph invariably
concluded with “Dr. Dibsby, as well as
being one of our leading specialists, has
found time to become quite a connois-
seur of art. He has the finest collection
of Mactavishes in the Southern Hemi-
sphere.”
Dibsby was now past middle age and
getting stout. He still pumped hay-fever
serum into the veins of the nation, for
the nation still sneezed as hard as ever.
He was often invited to open art exhibi-
tions and always said the same thing—
that he knew nothing about art —he was
a doctor—but art was a very important
thing and ought to be supported in every
way.
Mrs. Dibsby had grown tired of the
writers and now filled his home with
young Communists from the University.
Dibsby did not care for them. He
thought they were pretentious, not
specialists in anything, and their talk of
revolution filled him with alarm, but it
did not annoy him so much as their
open contempt for his Mactavishes and
their praise of one Podigliani. When
they talked about Podigliani it seemed
to Dibsby that they were not talking
about art but politics, but when he was
asked for his opinion he would wave his
“Soon his house was full of pictures” —
and this was one.
hand deprecatingly and say “I know no-
thing at all about it. I’m a specialist.”
Nevertheless, under his wife’s guidance
he began to acquire Podiglianis, and the
newspapers began to remark that it was
characteristic of him that, unlike the
official art stick-in-the-muds, he was in
the forefront of the new movement and
had the finest collection of Podiglianis in
the Southern Hemisphere.
One night, during one of his wife’s
parties, Dibsby noticed a young man
with a lively, intelligent, rather sarcastic
face and prematurely-bald head who sat
quietly listening to a discussion on the
respective merits of two of Dibsby’s
Podiglianis. The Communists main-
tained that, while the ideological content
of one —a view of some factories in which
none of the chimneys was straight—was
excellent, the other —a study of a
woman’s profile with two eyes on the
side of the head —contained traces of
bourgeois heresy. Dibsby was annoyed
with the discussion and turned to the
silent listener.
“What do you think?” he asked.
“Both of them are rubbish,” said the
young man shortly.
“Don’t you like them?” said Dibsby.
“It isn’t a question of likes or dislikes,”
said the stranger. “They’re just bad
paintings.”
Conscious that his wife’s eyes were on
him, Dibsby suddenly felt exasperated.
“How do you know they are bad paint-
ings?” he said, suppressing a desire to
say something stronger.
“I am a painter,” said the other simply.
Dibsby immediately felt sorry for the
young man. He thought of all the cases
of painters who disagreed with one
another, not only as regards particular
paintings, but over the very principles
“Filled his home with young Com-
munists.”
of their art. Moreover, he had heard his
wife argue with artists over this very
subject, and she had invariably come off
victorious.
“Does that entitle you to judge another
painter’s pictures?” he observed with an
air of innocence.
“Are you a painter?” said the young
man quietly.
“No,” said Dibsby. “I’m a doctor.”
“If I expressed an opinion on a surgical
dissection, how would you regard it?”
“Merely as an opinion,” said Dibsby.
“And your opinion on a work of art
is—merely an opinion,” said the other.
“There is no analogy,” said Dibsby
confidently. “Surgery is a science.”
“And so is painting,” said the stranger.
“Painting a science?” cried Dibsby, in-
furiated. “Rubbish! An art cannot be
a science.”
“That is what every layman says,” re-
plied the young man calmly, “because
he has no knowledge, only taste, and
taste without knowledge is only a belief
in current fashions. That’s why connois-
seurs buy Worpens one year, Mactavishes
the next and Podiglianis the year after.
“It makes real painters sick,” he went
on excitedly, not knowing that he was
speaking to his host. “A lawyer will
admit that he knows nothing about
chemistry ; in fact, he’ll be proud of it.
A chemist will admit that he knows no-
thing about the law. But impugn his
authority on matters of art and he will
fly into a rage. Let a painter tell him
that painting is the science of knowing
what things look like and that, as he
hasn’t practised the science, he can’t
know what things look like, and he will
be the painter’s enemy for life. Let”
But here they were interrupted by supper.
After the visitors had gone Mrs.
Dibsby, looking at her face in the glass
and patting her pale hair, remarked
“Wasn’t that artist interesting?” But
Dibsby did not reply. He felt he dis-
liked the artist even more than the Com-
munists.
From that night Dibsby began to ex-
press opinions about art which daily be-
came rriore definite. Art, he would say,
is a thing apart, it has laws of its own.
The artist who theorised about his art
ought not to be trusted. He was really
a child, almost a lunatic, albeit an in-
spired one, a trumpet through which
Nature spoke in order to reveal a new
beauty of its own.
Take Podigliani, for instance. He was
said to conceive his best work in a trance
and paint it in the dark, yet his genius
was recognised everywhere. He had put
two moons in one picture, and it was an
acknowledged masterpiece. In this age
of scientific materialism, the artist was
needed as never before, but he must be
the right sort of artist, and it was the
public which was the ultimate judge of
the value of his work.
A few artists laughed at Dibsby, but
their scorn, the product of envy, was lost
in the general applause.
Dibsby now gets great happiness out
of art. When he passes Judgment on pic-
tures he is listened to with respect,
especially by artists of the right sort.
One year he was painted by a fashionable
portrait painter. When he objected
to a detail the painter altered it and the
picture was subsequently highly praised
by all the best critics, which confirmed
Dibsby in his belief that artists needed
guidance.
It is confidently expected that Dibsby
will be appointed to the next vacancy on
a board which administers the estate of
a bookmaker who left a large sum for
the purchase of works of art. The pic-
tures bought are hung in the national col-
lection and invariably arouse a spirited
public controversy, during which every-
body, including the artists, say opposite
things and the board says nothing at all.
Meanwhile he still pumps serum into
the bloodstream of the nation and the
nation continues to sneeze its he id off.

Dan and Uncle.
BY STEELE RUDD.
LEAVING widow Carter’s little farm-
stead at early morn, Dan and Uncle
trudged silently on till the day grew
hot and they became hungry. Then they
rested in the shade of an old-time wooden
bridge that spanned King’s Creek to boil
the billy and eat.
It was a camping-place for travellers.
The water was deep and always running,
though lower down it dissolved to a
trickle till it disappeared below the sand,
as creeks have a habit of doing. Fire-
wood was in plenty —debris swept on to
the bank in flood time and collected by
one traveller and another.
Dan and Uncle removed their hats
and boots and sat mopping their brows
before dipping up pannikins of water and
drinking their fill.
“Splendid hole,” Dan reflected admir-
ingly. “If a cove had one like it an’ a
couple o’ hundred acres of this land
round here, he wouldn’t' call th’ King his
uncle.”
“I would say not,” Uncle, fondling his
bare feet, agreed; “but all round here
will be a reserve —th’ comminidge some
calls it.”
“If it wasn’t,” Dan reckoned, “we
wouldn’t be spellin’ here. They’d soon
sool their dogs on us.”
Dan began counting a fistful of silver
from one hand into the other—and Dan’s
hands could hold a lot of silver: “Fifteen
—sixteen —eighteen— twenty.” He paused,
looking puzzled: “Six bob a day for three
days? She should only have paid me
eighteen bob, and I’ve got about ten
more?”
“So you should have. I lent you the
ten shillings your mother gave me when
we were leaving Ruddville, till you could
break some of your big notes at a
bank.”
“Of course! ” Dan remembered, calmly
returning the whole of the money to his
pocket. “We’ll be coming to a bank,
p’raps to-morrer, or next day, or”
“Or n-n-n” (Uncle sneezed) “never,
prehaps! ”
“How much did you draw from the
little woman yourself?” Dan asked, ris-
ing to collect wood to start a fire with.
“Fer workin’ in her kitchen?” Uncle
looked surprised. “I wouldn’t ask money
from ’er fer thet. But I didn’t do it all
for nothin’. She made up for it in bread
an’ other things to take with us, an’ this
shoulder of cold mutton.” With that he
proceeded to open his swag.
Dan soon had a fire going and the billy
on to boil.
“She’s put other things in,” Uncle said,
coming upon a small tablecloth and a
knife and fork. And, blinking proudly, he
spread the cloth on the ground and began
“setting the table.”
“When you’ve med th’ tea, Dan,” he
announced, “we can begin. Everythin’
else is ready.”
“Here it goes!” Dan enthused as the
water started boiling and bubbling. “Now,
where’s th ’tea, Uncle, boy?”
Uncle looked alarmed.
“I haven’t th’ tea,” he answered ; “it
must be in your swag—an’ th’ sugar,
too.”
Dan was sure it wasn’t.
The billy boiled over, and he lifted it
from the fire and set it down safely.
“Hokey! You don’t say we’ve no
teal ” And Dan stared at Uncle.
Uncle became distracted. A meal was
no use to him without plenty of tea.
He turned and ransacked his swag
again, even to shaking out an old shirt.
“I med sure you had it, Dan,” he
sighed, putting the things back.
“Only hot water to drink! That’s
rotten ! ” from Dan.
Uncle sat flat down and, clasping his
bent-up knees with his two hands, looked
miserable.
“Never mind!” and Dan patted him
on the head. “We’ll buy plenty when we
come to th’ first store.”
Still, Uncle remained silent.
“Pity I didn’t keep some o’ that rum
I had,” Dan reflected uselessly ; then he
explored his own swag.
“It don’t matter,” Uncle saidj “I
wouldn’t touch grog, you know, Dan”- —
“A small drop wouldn’t hurt y’, just
now,” Dan said sympathetically.
Uncle shook his head. “Not even
though Scripter sez to ‘give him strong
drink so he won’t remember his miseries
any more.’ ”
“But what’s this?” And Dan held up
a strange parcel.
“Th’ little widder has done thet.
Uncle’s eyes twinkled. “Thet’s th’ tea an’
sugar.”
“And look here!” Dan made a farther
discovery, which he held up to view.
“A bottle o’ melon jam,” joyously from
Uncle.
“And a cake. And here ”■—excitedly
“some writin’ with it all.”
Dan held up a scrap of paper. Uncle
reached for it, and earnestly read what
was written on it: “First, wishing you
many happy returns of the day; and
second, A Merry Christmas and Happy
New Year to both. Mrs. M. Carter.
“Now, what do y’ think?” Dan smiled.
“A darn good little woman, widder or
no widder.’
“But whose birthday does she mean?”
Uncle questioned. “I never told her about
mine, an’ it must be a long way off to
yours, Dan?”
“I think I know,” the other mused.
“She told us one mornin’ that it would be
her birthday on Toosd’y. That will be
to-day, an’ I said I was born the same
time as ’er.”
“I wouldn’t have told her thet, Dan,”
Uncle disapproved; “it was deceivin’
her.”
“Uncle, boy,” Dan chuckled ; “you
can’t work th’ women like Daniel can.
Women alwuz think more of a man that
has th’ same birthday as themselves. And
between here an’ th’ Never Never there
must be a score of them with the same
birthday as me.”
“She’s a little lady is Mrs. Carter,”
Uncle repeated, “an’ she writes a college
hand.” Then he read the note again, and
was folding it to put in his pocket when
Dan objected.
“Here,” he said, “that was meant for
Daniel.”
“Just as you wish, Dan. There’s no
need for us to get senteemental about
it.” And Uncle handed it over.
“No harm, though,” Dan reckoned, “in
wearin’ her happy returns near to me
heart.” He stuffed the epistle inside his
open shirt. “And now I’ll drink her
health in a mouthful o’ tea.”
“And we got to thank her for havin’
any tea,” Uncle said as they both sat
round and began their dinner.
As they munched in silence Uncle’s
eyes roamed up the creek.
“What can thet be floatin’ down?” he
queried.
“A dead sheep I’d say from here,” Dan,
staring hard at the object, decided.
The strange object drew closer.
Then something surprising happened.
Right overhead the voice of an excited
youngster suddenly rang out:
“Look! Look, Eddie. A dawg in th’
water —a kang’roo d&wg! ”
“Sh-h! Shut up! They’ll ’ear y’!”
came warningly from another.
In an instant Dan was on his feet star-
ing up into the haunted sleepers of the
bridge. Uncle lifted his head and stared,
too. There, lying full length on the centre
sleeper, were two coatless, barefooted
youths gazing down with eyes full of
alarm.
“Well, I’m hanged!” Dan chuckled.
Then, raising his voice, he ordered them
to “come down out o’ that, you young
devils! ”
“They might’ve fallen on th’ two of
us,” Uncle mumbled.
The youths came down like a pair of
monkeys and stood shaking with terror.
But when Dan and Uncle started on their
dinner again, instead of cutting their heads
off, they gained confidence and smiled at
each other, then eyed the bread and cold
mutton covetously.
Uncle asked them if they had anything
to eat, and was told by the podgy one
“We et it a good while ago.”
“Give them somethin’,” Dan advised.
But just as Uncle began to carve some of
the mutton for them, the other youth, a
slim, sly fellow with sharp eyes, cried:
“Here they come!” and both darted
round the end of the bridge and took
cover.
Looking up the creek Dan and Uncle
saw a stout man and two tallish lads
coming over an embankment.
“Say, misters,” the podgy youth called
from their place of cover. “He’s th’
schoolmaster— don’t tell him we’re here!”
“We never seen a sign of either of
you,” Dan grinned. Uncle was seized
with a fit of coughing.
Next minute the schoolmaster and his
companions, two of the biggest and
fleetest-footed of his pupils, approached.
After scanning the bridge high and low
they asked Dan and Uncle if they had
“seen anything of two boys, a fat one and
a thin one.”
Uncle pretended not to hear. Dan
shook his head mysteriously, and said:

famous goldfields. From 1870 until 1916 gold to the
value of £22,000,000 was won from this area.
The chief industry of the district is now cattle raising,
although a limited amount of mixed farming i$

In 1872 the Bank of New South Wales established
a branch in Milchester, a suburb of Charters Towers,
and in 1874 opened the branch illustrated above. By
the provision of full banking facilities the Bank
contributed largely to the successful development of

now anchored calmly within a yard or
two of them.
“They are playing truant,” said the
schoolmaster, ignoring the corpse, “and

“You’d see them if they was about it,”
Dan observed indifferently.
At that moment the truants, boylike
peeped round a bridge pile. Their move-
ment was detected by one of the pupils.
There they are, sir!” he cried, and
bounded towards them.
Then an exciting chase began. The
truants, skedaddling abreast, their hats in
« j ands ? the wind in their hair, made
oft down the creek, the two pupils and
the master in pursuit—the latter far in
the rear.
Dan and Uncle stood up and watched
the race till pursued and pursuers all
disappeared m a bend of the creek.
t * Jj tde hlokes are givin’ ’em ago
for it, Dan chuckled gleefully as they sat
again to finish their meal—“a pair o’ good
little orses.”
“It’ll be no good to them, though, Dan
—not when they grow up!” Uncle said
thoughtfully. “You did a lot of it your-
self, if I remember. Prehaps, I did, too' ”
Gippsland Thoughts.
Wild lorelands face the windy strait;
Wet cliffs with beaches under.
Here break in either love or hate—
With music or with thunder—
All sober or intemperate,
The moody seas asunder.
Here have I gathered Nature’s lore,
By slow and patient spelling,
From primers of the bush and shore;
But on this thought I’m dwelling:
lhat volumes yet I might explore
With stranger tales for telling.
He je have I learned that beak and daw—
Although the weak one pities—
React unto a common law
That’s not confined to cities.
Some comfort from the fact I draw
For them who live by ditties.
Aye, inasmuch as yesterday,
In sweet October weather,
Upon my morning path there lay
A singing bluecap’s feather,
While on a branch not far away
Two kestrels sat together;
Albeit for a time I stood
Between two thoughts divided,
I saw at last that pity should
Be, justly, not one-sided.
’Tis mating time; a kestrel’s brood
Must be with food provided.
And this I’ve learned in quiet theme
Pursued through forests lonely,
Where stand some trees in life supreme
And some in death lie pronely—
That all the rest is but a dream :
One’s own soul matters only.

The Rain Corroboree.
BY A. B. CARRICK.
DOOLGAN’S wurlie stood on a bench
above the wide bed of the Engoor-
lindum River. It was only a cone-
shaped affair of sticks, bullrushes and
within which lay a bed formed of
bits of old woolpacks, blankets and bags.
Beside it a box held oddments in the way
of blackened billycans, tins and a few old
pipes.
Leaning against the outside of the hut
were a rusty old shotgun, an axe with the
splintered haft bound about with twine,
and some half-finished boomerangs which
he had been making to sell. About the
camp lay a litter of refuse: rags of dis-
carded clothing, empty tins and meat
bones, upon which the restless flies
buzzed, and other rubbish. Up to a week
previously there had also been half a
dozen skinny-ribbed, flea-tormented dogs
lying around the camp, but their bodies
now lay in a dry waterhole in the river
bed, shot by order of the new boss as
potential sheep-killers.
That new boss! Sitting in the entrance
of his wurlie, while the sunset glowed
redly upon the gaunt red-gums lining the
river, Doolgan thought bitterly of the
changes which had followed the death of
old Foster, the sale of the station and the
coming of the new boss.
Foster had been hard, but he wasn’t
mean, and always did what he said he
would do. If he promised two sticks of
tobacco for bringing in the grey mare
and yarding her, he gave two sticks —no
more, but no less. You could ride away
to look for her quite sure of payment
when you brought her in. If he threat-
ened to kick you should you ever do
something again, and you did it, he kicked
you for it at the first opportunity. And
always meat, flour, tea and sugar were
handed out to the old people every week.
But after a month of the new boss the
remnant of the tribe had cleared out.
Doolgan had tried to go with them, but
only a few miles had convinced him that
his walkabout days were over. He knew
what would happen to him once the tribe
scattered around the Oorapinna swamps.
He would be given whatever food could
be spared and a coolamon of water ; then
he would be left behind, prey for the
ants and the flies.
He would like to live a little longer,
bo he had watched the tribe go on with-
out him —a line of women and children,
"'ith the men scouting for game far
ahead, growing smaller and dimmer as
they tramped along, to be swallowed up
J n the heat-haze which danced and quiv-
ered over the sun-baked ground. And
l hen he had turned and had made his
s »ow way back to Engoorlindum.
This bench above the river had long
oeen a favorite camping-place of the
J'tbe. He had been born there, and now
oat the end of his life was approaching,
*s mind went back to those early memo-
les, long dormant, but now awakening
gain, as if life curved back like the flight
~'7 . tQ y boomerang to the place from
"'hich it started.
Doolgan looked round in the gatherins
dusk, his filmed and bleary eyes trying to
visualise it as it had been when he was
young. There were no white fellows on
Engoorlindum then; they were merely
strange fellows whom some of the men
f u ad ,! een when they went hunting around
the Ooranta range—strange beings whose
cruet aim in life seemed to be examining
every bit of white quartz they came
across, and whose chief needs seemed to
be women and information as to where
the next water was to be found.
Those had been happy days. Plenty
of game, plenty of seeds, water always
along the bed of Engoorlindum, raids on
the neighboring tribe for women. Night
after night the corroboree fires reddened
the branches. He closed his eyes and let
his thoughts run back to those happy
days, while the words of the songs ran
through his mind. He could picture it
° f fires ’ the Wom en
beating their thighs as they chanted with
their wide-eyed wee-ais and quee-ais sit-
ting around them, watching the men as
they stamped through the dances, hideous
in their array of lines of cockatoo down
stuck to their bodies with blood. They
had been good corroborees, each one con-
nected with some part of their life or the
things around them. One to make the
wamby snake fat; another to bring along
atoor, the wild turkey; the crow corro-
boree; the rain corroboree
Rain? Never could Doolgan recall so
long a spell without it. He had never
betore seen Engoorlindum without its
pools of water; the old men had never
spoken of a time when there were only
a few muddy puddles, growing smaller
every day. Every sheep on the run was
down there now, feeding on the reeds
rushes and water-grass in the nearly-drv
ui. ) he , , only feed now that the salt-
bush had been eaten to the sticks. There
was plenty of feed down there The
river was. nearly half a mile in width
hemmed in by cliffs of clay and lime-
stone ; it was thirty miles long from
where it began at the foot of the bare
granite Ooranta hills to the spot where
it emptied into the great Oorapinna
swamps, an expanse of reeds, mud and
quicksands, into some parts of which the
most fearless dusky duck-hunters had
been unable to go. Perhaps the fact that
the rain corroboree had not been sung for
so long was the cause of the dry spell
Doolgan began to croon the words, re-
peating them over and over again.
Eel budgee mun-der-ah,
Eel budgee mun-der-ah,
M’ll rayme, M’ll rayme mun-der-ah.
He raised his head with a sudden start.
He must have crooned the song over and
over again until he had fallen asleep
Now he was wide-awake and listening.
,fie night seemed to have become oppres-
sive and close. Faint and far in the sky
above was a sighing sound, broken every
now and then by a cry; there it was
again—crrrr-awnk, crrrr-awnk
Mountain duck on the wing! And
here came a louder rustling, and across
the stars passed endless strings of black

swans, their necks stiffly outstretched, and
giving an occasional eerie, fluting cry.
They passed, their flutings grew fainter
in the distance, and then came a whirring
which grew to the beat of hundreds of
wings as the teal and black duck came
skimming over the tree-tops, the noise of
their passing sending the sheep racing
together in the river below. Their baa-
ing echoed loudly as they huddled into
mobs. .
Doolgan grasped the sticks of the
wurlie to help him rise. Then he
hobbled out to the edge of the bench
to peer towards Ooranta. All the birds
were making that way—and over the
ranges hung a huge pall of cloud, the
lightning playing across its face, while
from its heart came the low, growling
rumble of the thunder.
Rain was falling oyer Ooranta, and the
wildfowl knew it. Instinct told them what
a quivering glow on the horizon meant,
and they would head for it from a hun-
dred miles away, flying for that distant
flicker of the thunderstorm. Rain, heavy
rain, was falling on Ooranta • • He,
Doolgan, had brought rain with his song.
He knew what would follow ; he had
often seen it happen. Those isolated
storms gathered over Ooranta every now
and again; the water poured off the
granite slopes; the floodwaters rushe
down the river. A flood was on its way
down now, a flood which would fill the
bed from cliff to cliff, six feet or more in
depth. And he had brought it with his
song! _ *
If Foster had been still alive Doolgan
would have hurried up to tell him his
song had brought rain, and warn him
to get the sheep up out of the rivei
before the water came. But for the new
boss Doolgan would not stir. The new
boss had kicked him only two days ago
just for asking for tobacco; and had
shot the dogs. White men didn t like the
new boss, either-though they excused
him because he had been only a few years
in Australia, and didn’t know the> ropes
yet But all the same both of the old
station hands had left him, their places
taken by two lads from a city employ-
ment agency.
Doolgan could not grasp the meaning
of it all. His mind could only grip the
fact that the new boss was different from
other white men; he didn’t like him.
Let the new boss look after his own
sheep!
The old man sat down on the edge of
the bench, put his unlighted and empty
pipe into his nearly toothless jaws and
waited. The night wore slowly away, and
at last the water came, when the pale
green of the false dawn was throwing the
clouds over Ooranta into relief.
First there were only a few trickles of
water, glittering now and then in the
starlight as they crept through the
trampled reeds, and bringing the smell
of mud. Then he could hear a faint
noise up river—a whispering which
became a murmur. It swelled to a noise
like wind in trees, and, with a crackling
of reeds and a rushing of water, the flood
swept down.
Horses scampered up the banks as they
heard it, with snorts of fear and thud-
ding of hooves. Sheep were rushing to
the fast-vanishing high spots, where they
huddled together in loudly baaing terror.
The light broadened with the approach
of dawn; the smell of wet wool was
added to that of the water and mud.
Odd sheep went floating by on the
current.
The growing light of the east revealed
a vast spread of water, dotted with lsland-
like clumps of sheep, the outer ones being
swept off by the current every few
seconds.
The new boss lay in bed staring at the
calico ceiling of his room, listening to
the noise from the river. After a time he
went over to the window, blinking
sleepily, and leaned out. A wandering
puff of air brought the frightened chorus
of the sheep to his ear, while he sniffed
at the smells of wet earth and wool. Then
his heart contracted with sudden fear as
he grabbed for trousers and boots and
raced outside, yelling for the two lads
to come. He let the dogs loose as he
passed the kennejs, and ran with racing
heart and heaving lungs for the river
bank.
They managed to save some six hun-
dred sheep out of as many thousand. As
the new boss was still young enough to
learn, the subsequent fight to rebuild his
fortune not only knocked all the arrog-
ance out of him but turned him into a
man by Australian standards.
But Doolgan did not live to see it.
The day after the flood Doolgan died
from the effects of a gorge of mutton
from the carcass of a drowned sheep.
Being an aborigine, he died happy, for
he had a full belly.
Nasturtiums.
Single nasturtiums are gilded trumpets
Piercing the garden’s blossom spate;
The double flowers are royal dancers
In orange robes by the temple gate.
The trumpets rise on a note of summer;
The rose swings censers of crimson dusk,
Till the dancers lean like a golden goddess
Accepting tribute of myrrh and musk.

Cap and Bells.
Tragedy comes in cap and bells —
Laugh, young love, if you can!
It’s not pale Grief in her queenliness
But wrinkled Farce as a man.
It’s not the grandeur of purple silks,
Glimmering, soft and cool,
But the ragged motley upon the back
Of a spent, malicious Fool.
It’s not the graceful flute or the harp
Or the piercing violin,
But the silly tinkle of little bells
And a jester’s mirthless grin.
Oaf for queen and Farce for woe
And chuckle for weary sigh—
Tragedy comes in cap and bells,
So laugh, young love —or you die!

Summer Sun-shower.
There is laughter in the air if one but listens j
after rain, .
Where the little silver locusts drip in shining
hordes again.
There is thin transparent music in a hundred-
noted theme —
Like a faint, elusive nocturne in a tued musi-
cian’s dream.
One can see the wide enjoyment thrown in
sprays of twinkling mirth
Where the little silver locusts reach the wel-
come of the earth,
While the flowers are flaunting diamonds from
the sun-reflecting drips,
With the shining facets winking on their
crystal-studded lips.
One can hear the sound of laughter, if one
listens after rain:
Hear an aria of laughter, hear a tarantelle
again;
Hear the butcher-bird go gurgling, hear the
gullies echo him,
While the laughter of the river breaks in
bubbles on the brim.

PHYLLIS GURNEY WRIGHT.
The Low Comedians.
O scarlet-nosed exploiters of the trite,
Witness a brother “comic’s” laugh and clap.
No need have you of matter erudite;
Your happy lot is cast in Fortune’s lap.
With you some strange, compelling power lies,
Some virtue that the god of Humor grants
To widened mouth, misfitting hats and vests
And sounds of tearing pants.
The day and chance are yours beyond a doubt.
Time’s whirligig has brought revenge unfit;
The dearth of cultured wit has frozen out
The subtler wags of humorous “legit.”
Their fur coats and their hopes have both gone
west.
A favored few in celluloid may grin,
Machine-made, censored fooling at the best.
You’re in demand; you win.
And what resource you have! There are the
times „ ..
When jokes misfire or fail to win response;
You then insult the partner in your crimes,
Sit on his hat or hit him on the sconce.
If gag or story on its mission limps
You nimbly turn the patched-postenor pose,
Or just allow the underlings to glimpse
The Dame’s pink underclothes.
Some of your jests were bandied in the Ark,
When wet days meant a tedium unending,
And Japhet slapped his brother for a lark,
Having, too literally, caught him bending.
Black envy fills my soul; your heavy chaff,
Your back-chat pleasantries, however stale
Or vulgar, seldom miss the ready laugh,
While mine too often fail.
For me to raise a laugh means heavy toil.
I rack my brain for happy rhyme and
whimsey, . ~ .
The while I burn expensive midnight oil,
Only to find my hope’s foundations flimsy.
A super-jaded, ink-stained potentate,
Steeped in misanthropy and chronic bile,
Will scan my jest and then decree its fate;
I doubt he’ll even smile!

BILL O’C.
“Murrungurry”: Queensland has pro-
duced many Amazons. One of them, a
kangaroo-shooter and trapper, now gone
to the happy hunting-grounds, was
known from Cairns to the Diamantina as
“Bill Ainsworth.” At the beginning she
shared the hunter’s life with her husband,
travelling from camp to camp in a light
waggonette. Her spouse was drowned
in the Diamantina, after which she car-
ried on alone, working over great
stretches of country and delivering regu-
lar loads of skins. She was a crack shot,
skilled in bushcraft, hardy and vigorous,
and always kept to herself—a bush
nomad to whom the campfire alongside
a waterhole was home. Even when busi-
ness took her to town, she pitched her
tent outside in preference to staying at
a hotel, and declined invitations to
private houses. A stranger meeting “Bill”
in the bush had to look at her twice to
know that she was a woman, for she
wore male garb—skirts being a disadvan-
tage —and smoked as much tobacco as
any man did.

“THE DOUGHMAN”
By Robert Desmond Tate.
The Literary Sensation of the Year.
This is the Author’s brilliant first novel; it is the first of its kind among our
novelists. It translates, in terms of the sharpest realism, an aspect of life in the raw
—in the sweat and steam, the stealth and sinister dealings that may form the
atmosphere of industrial workers. It shows the reaction of a girl of clean character
and a man who, in other circumstances, might have been an inspiration to men.
The Press Gave Unstinted Praise to “The Doughman,”
"SYDNEY MORNING HERALD”:... .“the most, strikingly original Australian
novel io appear for a long time. Mr. Tate writes with vitality and conviction
“is relentless realism shocks the more fastidious readers. The descriptive work
is uncommonly good.”
“THE BULLETIN”: “the novel is a hold, dramatic conception, working up to
a spectacular climax... .a novel with the stuff of life in it.”
"THE TELEGRAPH” (Sydney): “the most distinctive piece of writing
evolved in Australia for many a long day it contains one of the most magnificent
portraits of a nagging wife 1 don’t remember anything so good in any book
....such a hook as this would he a sure Book-of-the-Month in England.”
