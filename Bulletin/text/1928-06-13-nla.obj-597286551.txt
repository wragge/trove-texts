The Red Page
The Mother Complex
In Barrie (Cape), Thomas Moult insists
that his subject is a genius, a great “master
of two arts.” We are invited to bow down
before Barrie’s drawing-aside of the curtain
of romance, to congratulate ourselves that
this vision was vouchsafed to a supren
artist in our day. Barrie is bracketed wit.
Burns and Scott and Stevenson; again anc
again we are told that he is a great creativ
genius.
But it is not so. Sir James Barrie
none of these things, any more than th
book is a study of his work. The book
a personal rapture, and a far too carele
one.
“Nothing that happens after we are
matters very much,” a quotation fror
“Margaret Ogilvy,” is a statement that won
mean more to a, doctor of psychology tha
to the average sentimental man. To tl
critic it is what is known as the literal
gesture, a delicate example of the fals
pungency that can be packed into a sof
harmless-looking phrase. To the doctor o
psychology it would probably indicate
mother complex, “Sentimental Tommy
“Peter Pan” and “Mary Rose” being stron
contributory evidence for the diagnosi
One of the clearest symptoms of this com
plex is the mentgl inability to grow up
nothing worth while does seem to happer
after the age of 12 or so.
Following this lead, from “Margate
Ogilvy, by Her Son,” Barrie’s monumen
to his mother, one brushes away the tende
charm, and notes that the little fatherlcs
boy was always looking at himself tryin
to make his mother happy. One points ou
the softness of (he book, and the same Soft
ness in “A Window in Thrums.” By corol
lary it can be argued that the facility whicl
can produce “My Lady Nicotine.” “Th
Little Minister,” “The Admirable Crichton
and “The Little White Bird” is more
feminine quick-change facility than
masculine. Finally one indicates the title
the shadowy delicacy of the treatment
and the uncanny insight of “What Even
Woman Knows.” Going back God know
how many years to the first night in Lon
don, I remember the flushed delight of the
women in the audience and the stolidity o
the men. “No man has any right to know
so much,” the women told each other.
If the average man’s mother is his reli-
gion, his dearest and holiest spiritual pos-
session, he is in a sale and happy place
He has a -faultless tribunal or a deep anc
tender memory that nothing can assail, ar
anchorage that cannot fail him. To other
people she may be a difficult megalo-
maniacal old matriarch; but his eyes refuse
to see any blemish. To him she is happilv
perfect, and that’s all’ there .is about it.
But that good fortune, that spiritual
safety, cannot be granted to the creative
artist. His only gift from the gods is the
clearness of his sight; his job is to see
every quality in every character in his
vision. He must 'have the male stiffening as
well as the female tenderness; by a too-
elose communion with his mother his crea-
tive mind runs the risk of assuming a
feminine, even a motherly, point of view.
A talented charm may eventuate from this
sympathy with one half of mankind, but
not more than a talented sensitive charm.
The rare sympathy of the mother com-
plex may make him write always for child-
ren. He may do this in such a way that
there will be a self-conscious motherly
grace in all that he writes, a self-conscious-
ness that his audience of children, grown-
up or not, readily forgives. He will be
permitted to commit -the gross artistic sin
of Peter Pan’s funning down to the foot-
lights and crying to the audience to clap
their hands as proof of their belief in
fairies. It is only a story and we are all
only children,- he seems to say with a sad
sweet smile. What does anything matter
after .the age of 12?
. Everything matters’ after that age. It
is only after that age of flux has gone that
anything matters, primarily, to the creative
artist. Life, true and dull and heroic,
standing motherless on its own feet, is
only beginning then, for all it is a closed
book to the mother complex.
In his field of gestures and fairy make-
believe, Barrie is a, charming fellow, a
talented fellow of infinitely ingenious
delight; and that is a most excellent
secondary field to be in. But when a man
of the importance of Thomas Moult writes
seriously of geniuses and the great major
creative artists, one feels that a few words
ought to be said, however rude and ungrate-
ful they may seem.
HILARY LOFTING.
The Literary Patriot
“Country Fed” (R.P. 23/5/’2B) makes
the enthusiastic admission that in the
teaching of literature he is proud to put
patriotism before literary appreciation.
Even with all literary things equal I should
regard that as narrow; with such things as
unequal as they seem to me to be, I can-
not regard it as anything but foolish. The
fact that The Ontario Education Depart-
ment shares “Country Ped’s” view does not
prove that view to be right; it proves
merely that the Ontario Education Depart-
ment thinks about literature as the Cana-
dian Government thinks about butter, in-
stead of regarding it as an international
commodity, like air and water; and I, one
ol the most gentle of mortals, tenderly
advance that for that sin the Ontario Edu-
cation Department should be put and
sowne in a skin, with a dogge, a cocke, a
snake and an ape, according to the ancient
law against parricides. It is just that sort
ot sinning which I should like to see the
pedagogues of this country rise above. In
the teaching of literature the golden rule
surely ought to be “The best—never mind
whose! ” To hear a teacher asserting “I do
contend that Australian literature should
be placed first” pains me like a physical
hurt. I know quite well that we already
have a most respectable lot of Australian
writings, though every example of it that
“Country Ped” has quoted for us is
wretched shoddy; but I would ask, what
is the best we have done compared with
the best done in those, old islands in the
cold North? And, to paraphrase an old
Bulletin joke, who are our children that
they should not have), the best?
I cannot accept that it is the job of a
teacher of literature to teach children love
of country (an instinct, the “teaching” of.
which is sheer kite-flying redundancy). His
job is to teach them literature, and I feel
sure that if he can lead them to feel the
poetry ol Keats and Shelley or see the
magic iight in the Border ballads, he may
•safely leave them to reach out, for such
things as’“An Anzac’s Thoughts of Home”
m due time and with some idea of values.
On the other hand, I cannot believe that
this particular thing, which “Country Ped”
calls a “poem,” will lead them up to any
appreciation of poetry. That argument is
to say that the way to help children to
grow up with an appreciation of music is
to train them to listen assiduously to jazz
bands.
Finally, “Country Ped” accuses me of
forgetting that “our native literature is
part parcel of the wider English litera-
ture.” On the contrary, I recognise or
recollect that undeniable fact with sadness
and with pain. To-day Americans are be-
ginning to write American literature, some
of which is great, magnificent. It is «o
because it has at last ceased to be “part
and parcel of the wider English literature.”
It is written in' English, but, for all that it
is English literature it might as well have
been written in Peruvian. And what of
us? Henry Lawson—and what else? A few
things; a little fluttering handful.
I am confident that our individual,
distinctively Australian literature will
come in its good time. The seeds have
been auspiciously set, and a pleasing forest
is already springing. We should keep this
judiciously under the eyes of our children,
that they might appreciate its merit with-
out being blind, to its extent. We do
something worse than merely commit a
folly if we try to induce them to believe
that these saplings are incomparable giants.
CECIL MANN.
Art in the Theatre
Let us rejoice that Australia has its
Duncan Maedougall; let us rejoice that
The Bulletin permits - him to meander
around the Red Page ■ (16/5/’2B) with lazy
generalisations upon Art in the Theatre;
finally, let us rejoice that we are not all
suffering from the same lofty contempt for
the things that, are, even though we live
for the things which may be. Above all,
let us be honest with ourselves, and analyse
the faults and merits of the theatre with
a practical mind, and in so doing strengthen
our arguments instead of burying our
heads in the sands of idealism—so often
synonymous with all that is unpractical.
“Art” is a dangerous word, long discarded
by those who might in all modesty justify
its use. “Art Theatre” ought to be rele-
gated into the limbo of unremembered
things. “Drama with the lid off” is much
more explicit, but less grand. It is so
practical, therefore it is not used. “Art
Theatre” means nothing. The educated
people know it means nothing; the un-
educated people do not know what it means.
It is, therefore, an ideal phrase.
The “Art Theatre” is a cherished illu-
sion. Some day a man of vigor will destrov

have been greatly augmented—values are still unbeatable, and an
expert and courteous staff can, if desired, give great assistance
in the selection of any sporting material.

of practice nets, the laying down of a putting green for golfers,
complete with cup and flag and a special come-back putting cup.

all requirements, and Anthony Horderns’ cordially invite you to
make the greatest use of it without any obligation whatever.

it as Bernard Shaw has attempted half-
heartedly, to destroy it One day a Prose-
nef „rii arise who will arraign the Art
Theatre” and charge it with the wilful
murder of good drama, of harboring bad
Sed n ?egularlv by the vendors of obscene
postcard* Used also by the vendors of
obscene drama. If tragedy and comedy are
the two extremes of the same emotion, then,
too, are beauty and vulgarity.
We want the theatre militant; we want
drama with the lid off; we want equally
much beauty and sincerity. There aie
greater things in life than sex; there are
nobler things than reclaimed prostitutes.
There are sweeter things than foul language,
healthier things than suggestiveness. But
who would think so if their fare were art
drama? The vulgarity of Shakspeare the
sensuousness of Anatole France, the licen-
tiousness of Balzac —these are but phases
in a master mind. They betray the latent,
sometimes potent, emotions in the best and
in the worst of use. Real art reveals
beauty in. ugly things, tenderness in the
most brutal.
The dramatists of to-day, shrieking their
earnestness from the housetops—with
“life,” “truth” and “candor” emblazoned on
their banners —are mostly traitors in the
cause of drama. They forget the beautiful
under their mask of “life”; they forget that
half the “truth” is usually a lie, and use
“candor” as a cloak for obscenity.
The “Art Theatre” has fallen into the
same rut. It needed the “commercial
theatre” to give the beauty of “Saint Joan”
to the world, the exquisite comedy of “The
Romantic Young Lady,” the mightiness of
“The Master Builder.” Let. the “Art The-
atre” forget its “art,” and return to the
poetic beauty and true simplicity of the
master dramatist. Let it learn humbleness
and it will prosper. It will begin to achieve
what it has pretended to achieve, and,
instead of taking the sordidness and
obscenity of life, it will start giving, giving
beauty, radiating “sweetness and light.”
RICHARD GARWYN.
Stuff and Nonsense
I have just uead Walter de la Mare’s en-
trancing little volume Stuff and Nonsense.
And I want to talk about it. There are
some books that are childishly easy to
review, the method being the simple one of
liberal quotation with interspersed critical
patter. This is a work of that delightful
class. Every page scintillates with diamonds,
readily detachable, still entire in epigram-
matic brilliance, from the context. But it
is too easy. Let us, instead, quote one
poem only, and that in full. This will afford
an opportunity of looking into its merits a
little more critically, and let us hope more
usefully than is possible by indulging in the
too-facile scrap-book procedure:—
HYSSOP.
Said Judge Jessop,
“The hyssop
You think’s in your wall
Correctly
And strictly
Isn’t hyssop at all.”
“Isn’t hyssop?” says I;
“Isn’t hyssop,” says he;
“By no means—not hyssop at all.”
“It my hyssop,
Judge Jessop,
Isn’t hyssop at all,
Tell me truly
And duly
Why it grows on my wall! ”
“Why it grows on ?” says he.
“Yes, it grows on,” says I;
“Why it grows on and grows on my wall.”
“On the Bisop,”
Said Judge Jessop,
“(With the h out), we’ll call,
And straightly,
Sedately,
We’ll resort to your wall.”
“With a ladder?” says I.
“With a ladder,” says he ;
“And we’ll ask him—‘What’s that in the wall?’ ”
So the Bisop
Judge Jessop
And me—three in all—
Hell and leather
Together
Climbed up on my wall.
“What’s that there?” says I.
“What’s what where?” says he;
“Why, house-leek,” said the Bisop. That’s all.
First, in general sweeping assertion, it is
good; it is amazingly good. Next, for the
more obvious special beauties. The exqui-
site appropriateness of the verse-form chosen
is a matter to be felt, rather than explained.
An analysis, however, would draw attention
to the effectiveness gained by the use of
long and short lines in conjunction, long
rhyming with long and short with short (is
this, by the way, one of the characteristic
elements in the fascination which the form of
the limerick possesses?); to the occasional
employment of such delicate assonances as
“correctly” and “strictly,” “Jessop” and
“hyssop” (towards the revival of which
charming Elizabethan mode in modern lyric-
verse. De la Mare, as everybody knows, has
contributed perhaps more than any other
living poet); to the perfect balance of the
whole, best illustrated, perhaps, in the
quaint repetitive character of the seventh
and eighth lines in each stanza; and finally
to the adherence throughout, save in one
pair of lines, to the same rhyme-sounds.
The sense of lack of effort in construction,
the air of artistic “inevitability” pervading
the whole thing, these graces are doubtless
achieved, in part at least, as a direct out-
come of the simplicity of the diction.
Simple it certainly is (there isn’t a single
conventionally “poetic” word dragged in
anywhere); with just sufficient piquancy
of purposely stilted style in the Jmge a
precise “correctly and strictly” and similar
mannerisms to achieve the requisite navoi
of veritable mock-heroic. It is quite im-
possible to resist saluting the subtlety of the
wit displayed in the delayed mention, as
if it were a dutiful afterthought, of the
omission of the obstreperous “h” in the
ecclesiastical dignitary’s title. And I do
hope the printer hasn’t seen fit to mar a
perfect climax by gracing the curt final
sentence in the poem with unnecessary in-
verted commas.
It is time, however, we looked at what,
if the least obvious, is yet possibly the most
noteworthy excellence of all. As a fine
nonsense-poem the piece has already abun-
dantly justified itself. But it has claims'
to a deeper merit. It presents us, for good
measure, with a remarkable bit of character-
drawing. Observe how accurately the three
persons concerned in the tragic tale —the
Judge, the owner of the hyssop that proves
to be but unromantic house-leek, and the
Bisop—are delineated strictly “in charac-
ter” all the time. The Judge is a downright
personage—does he not asseverate, in the
most unequivocal terms, his disbelief of
the legitimacy of the claim advanced by
the wall-infesting plant to the title of the
noble family of hyssop? Yet he is no
barren doubter, no hard-boiled agnostic.
He boasts his proper measure of reverence
for higher authority—does he not invoke
the supreme decision of the Chui'ch? A
perfect country gentleman of the old school,
you picture him; bluff, indeed, and accus-
tomed to command, but one who gets things
done. Observe, moreover, his exhibition of
delicate courtesy, in retiring to the back-
ground when the climax he has planned
arrives, and permitting the owner of the
hyssop to propound the crucial question to
the Bisop. Then the speaker himself: he
is of the docile type, ready to follow any-
one who gives him a lead. His questioning
in the second stanza is the true ineffective s
pathetic attempt to stand on his dignity.
How soon and how readily, however, he
falls in with the scheme a stronger person-
ality suggests! That futile attempt at
cheery helpfulness “With a ladder?” only
serves to enhance the impression of his
patent helplessness. A very commonplace
gentleman.
And, finally, the Bisop. I ask you—
now wouldn’t a Bisop (with or without
the “h”), haled unceremoniously* forth while
meditating his Lenten sermon, and be-
guiled into uncanonically clambering up on
a garden wall to decide a problem in applied
botany—now, wouldn’t he, remembering
his manners, consent? And wouldn’t he,
remembering his interrupted sermon, deliver
judgment in two laconic words, and
promptly clamber down again to respect-
able earth as fast as his gaiters would
carry him?

A Satchel of Books
Malayan Nights, by Peter Martin (Unwin:
Robertson and Mullens). A well-spun ath-
letic yarn of rubber smuggling and mysteri-
ous Malay piadonnas by an Australian who
obviously knows the country well.
Shalcspeare, Jonson and Wilkins as Bor-
roicers, by Percy Allen (Palmer). The
author, a dramatic critic, here applies his
stage knowledge to problems whose solution
is usually left to students of the text of
these writers. “Never, I suppose,” says he,
“in the history of literature, has borrowing
been so much practised as among the drama-
tists of the Elizabethan age,” and he sub-
scribes to Steevens’s opinion that Sliakspeare
did not attempt a single play on any sub-
ject till the effect of the same story, or at
least the ruling incidents in it, had been
tested on the stage and familiarised to the
audience.
Dictionary of Quotations and Proverbs, by
J. K. Moorhead and Charles Lee (Dent).
Of the making of books of quotations there
is no end. The present one is based on the
“Familiar Quotations” produced in Massa-
chusetts by John Bartlett nearly 60 years
ago, and that explains why American authors
and statesmen rather crowd it. The only
Australian who seems to have been able to
get in is Barrington, with his “True patri-
ots all, for be it understood We left our
country for our country's good,” and
somebody had said something,very like that
before: Farquhar, in “The' Beaux’ Strata-
gem,” a hundred years earlier had’ written :
“ 'Twas for the good of my country I
should be abroad.” Still, though some of our
unrecognised statesmen have said as wise
things as many of the other statesmen who
chatter here, these are a very useful couple
of volumes, admirably arranged and, as
usual in this Everyman’s Library series, very
clearly printed.
A Diplomat Off Duty, by Sir Fx-ancis
Lindley (Benn). The British Minister to
Norway—and before he was sent there as
Plenipotentiary lie was in Vienna, Persia,
Egypt, Japan, Sofia and Petrograd—has pro-
duced such a book of excursions and dis-
cursions as few men could write. From any
point—it hardly matters where —he rambles
on most interestingly. Here, for instance,
is a long “chapter” on bathing. He can’t
decide between the Atlantic and the Pacific.
The best “bathes” he ever had were one off
the Spanish coast, the other in Japan—
Atlantic and Pacific. But, as he mentions
with i-egret, he doesn’t know the islands of
the South Pacific or the surf of “Sydney
Heads.” He has no doubt, though, as to
which sex shines most in the water. “Here
woman is as supreme as in the ballroom or
tl.e home.... In actual swimming women dis-
play a co-ordinated and harmonious vigor of
which they show little ti’ace in other athletic
exercises. ... The old Greeks knew their
business when they conjured Aphrodite from
the waves.”

WEDNESDAY, JUNE 13, 1928.
THE COUNTRY THAT HAD NO LAND.
The Prime Minister recently felt it neces-
sary to define his Government’s position as
regards soldier settlements. It appeared
that, towards the end of the war
“It was decided that it was most desirable
that such of the soldiers as wished to go on
the land and were fitted to become land
settlers should be given an opportunity of
doing so. The Commonwealth, however, had
no lands under its jurisdiction which were
suitable for soldier settlement, the Common-
wealth being limited to the Federal Capital
area and the Northern Territory.”
After these introductory observations, which
were the really important feature of the
story, Mr. Bruce explained that the Federal
authority, then mostly Billy Hughes,
approached the States with offers of much
loan money on easy terms, and found the
States generally approachable. But the
States absolutely refused to let the Com-
monwealth have any voice in the manage-
ment of the scheme, wherefore the Prime
Minister now disclaims all responsibility
for the vast losses.
* * * *
Still, if the disastrous policy was wished
on to the States by Hughes, Bruce, his
colleague and successor, hasn't improved,
much on William’s work. The basis of
the trouble was that the Commonwealth
“had no lands” of its own. Now, what
was the actual position? It had the North-
ern Territory, which measures 335,116,800
acres (523,620 square miles), and of this
area 334,639,800 acres are still wholly its own
and unalienated. That part of the Terri-
tory which lies within the temperate zone
amounts to 97,300 square miles, and Vic-
toria covers only 87,884. The section which
is blessed with a rainfall of from 15in. to
40iri. and upwards comprises 250,340 sq.
miles. N. S. Wales and Victoria combined
have 251,783 sq. miles with over 15in. of
annual downpour, and N. S. Wales, Vic-
toria and South A us. put together can
show no more than 284,733 square miles
of the same sort. Westralia, which extends
from south to north of Australia and com-
prises one-third thereof, has 233.876 square
miles on which the gentle moisture drops
from Heaven to the average extent of
per annum and more. In fact, Queens-
land is the only State which equals the
Territory in this respect, and it is a respect
of very great importance.
* * St St
The Territory possesses hills climbing
to an altitude of close on 5000 ft., and the
Federal “Year Book” credits it with 10
rivers having a more or less navigable
length of 100 miles and over, the longest
being 350 miles. That is taking no account
of mystery water-courses such as the
Finke, which wander into the interior,
As many Queensland streams do. Neither
Victoria nor S. Australia has any
river wholly its own to compare with the
Territory’s best effort. In addition, Alice
Springs, the capital of what is now/ called
Central Australia, is within two /lays of
Adelaide arid three days of Melbourne, or
perhaps less if the machine files easily.
Alice Springs is the town where one of the
new “independent” Administrators sits in
pomp and dignity, when he happens to fee
sitting at all, and finds that he has to refer
everything to Federal headquarters in the
old, old way, arid that headquarters, being
frozen at Canberra, replies even, less than
formerly.
With 250.340 square miles of fair-rainfall
country in its sole possession, the Federal
Government, then, decided that it had no
lands of its own “suitable for soldier settle-
ment.” So it helped to deposit ex-Diggers
and their families in S. Australia and Vic-
toria, where it had no land, suitable or
otherwise. The North has its drawbacks,
as have most places; but it emphatically is
not one of Nature’s failures. Nature has
had very little to do with its non-success
thus far. Experimental freaks, for one
thing, enacted that no land may be sold in
the Federal area; and tired freaks who.
“administered” from a distance made no
effort to see if something better than
hitherto could be done under a leasehold
policy. Tho railway to which the Com-
monwealth has been pledged for 16 years
has never been built, partly because all
available money was wanted for places
where there were many voters to be pla-
cated and for comic entertainments such as
the Commonwealth Shipping Line. Finally,
the Big City craze is bad for the pioneer-
ing instinct, which tends to die out in con-
sequence.
« si: * s;s
North and Central Australia, as * the
Bruce-Page Ministry re-named its pro-
perty in a spurt of bold adventure, are
estimated to have lost 25 per cent, of their
handful of inhabitants between New Year s
Day, 1918, and the same date 1926. The
expenditure of so much loan money to
hustle new settlers into old States probably
explains why.
FUNCTIONS OF JUDGE AND JURY.
The judgment of the N. S. Wales Court
of Criminal Appeal in the Whittaker case
raises a point of interest not only to jurists
but to jurymen also. Apart from the con-
sideration whether the sentence was heavy
or light, it raises the question of where the
line is to be drawn between the functions
of the Judge and the jury. Here a man was
charged with murder, and on the evidence
submitted it may be that the Judge himself
thought the accused guilty of that crime;
but the jury found him guilty of man-
slaughter only and added a strong recom-
mendation to mercy. Had they acquitted
him altogether he would have gone free.
By finding him guilty of the lesser offence
they put it in the Judge’s power to punish
him.
Assuming for the purpose of argument
that the Judge believed the man guilty of
murder, despite the jury’s finding that he
was not, should then the Judge take
advantage of the lesser finding to express
his own belief in the term of the sentence
he imposes, there being no law expressly
preventing him from pronouncing any sen-
tence he thinks fit short of sentence of
death? To say yes suggests a course un-
sound and dangerous. It means, in effect,
that the Judge has the right to usurp the
function of the jury, namely, that of say-
ing whether the crime, or any essential
element of the crime, has been proved to
their satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt.
Yet they are the constitutional judges of
the facts. If there is evidence of a state
of facts which would amount to murder,
they say by their verdict that those are
the facts, and their verdict is conclusive;
and it is equally so if they find that the facts
do not amount to murder but only to the
lesser offence of manslaughter. Surely the
facts upon which the Judge must base his
sentence are what the jury find to be the
facts, otherwise he is sentencing the
prisoner for an offence of which the jury,
rightly or wrongly, have acquitted him.
* * * *
Justice Ferguson in his report to the
Court of Appeal stated the principle he
conceived to be the right one. “The
acquittal upon one charge,” he said, “is
as conclusive as the conviction upon the
other, and the Judge has no right either
to sentence the prisoner for an offence of
which he has been acquitted, or to assume
that he may have been guilty of it, in
assessing the penalty for the offence of
which he has been convicted.” Still, the
Court allowed the appeal of the Crown
against the sentence, holding that the
responsibility of apportioning the punish-
ment rested with the .fudge, and that he
must act upon his own view of the cir-
cumstances surrounding the crime. In dis-
missing everything else from his considera-
tion than the assumption that the story
told by the prisoner was substantially true,
as the trial Judge said in effect he had
done, he had proceeded on a wrong prin-
ciple, and precluded himself from exer-
cising his discretion as lie should have done,
upon a judicial review of the whole of the
facts established in evidence—that is to
say, the facts supporting the indictment for
murder, which the jury by their verdict
rejected, as well as the'facts upon which
they grounded their finding of man-
slaughter.
* * * *
When juries realise the full import of
this judgment they will acquit prisoners on
capital charges where they do not consider
such charges proved, and avoid the alter-
native verdict of manslaughter—even with
a recommendation to mercy—as that may
be merely returning them to the jeopardy,
short of death, from which it had been in-
tended to rescue them.
MANKEYS AND WOMONKS.
An atmosphere of the unwholesome hangs
about the proposition of Voronoff, who
proposes to prolong life by grafting mon-
key glands on human beings. The monkey-
fied person (mankey if male and womonk
if female) is to be treated every four years
or so, for it isn’t a matter of a single
operation; one ape doesn’t make a sum-
mer. The resulting longevity is to be any-
thing from 140 years to the dim indefinite,
and it is said that the effect will be—in
fact, already is—more marked on womonks
than on mankeys.
It is a moot point whether indefinite
existence wouldn’t pall on the possessor
(to say nothing of the fact that he might
pall on other, people), though he would
probably stick it out because death would
seeVn more horrible through being so un-
usual. To share the common lot isn’t so
bad, but to have a lien on the uncommon
lot—to be the pioneer corpse when death
resumed through the monkey effect wear-
ing out—would probably be terrifying.
There are no precedents in the way of
fact to go upon, but fiction supplies some.
The Wandering Jew was a melancholy cuss,
but then he was a Robinson Crusoe semi-
immortal, and dragged his cross alone. The
Flying Dutchman is also regarded as de-
pressed. Walter Besant painted a striking
picture when he wrote “The Inner House.”
His community of indefinite long-livers
found its privilege become a nuisance be-
caqse the old didn’t die to make room for
the young. In the end the old were abol-
ished with an axe; birth was abolished, too,
except to replace somebody killed by acci-
dent. The result was a community bored
into mental blankness, all save a few stren-
uous spirits who kept awake to run the
show. Dean Swift's Struldbruggs who
dwelt in Luggnagg were a cheerless gang.
And while it is asserted that mahatmas
can live to a great age it is seldom that an
authentic mahatma is found bawling and
roystering and drinking after hours.
It appears that the Voronoff experiment
must in time be bad for the birth-rate.
Supposing a family included six genera-
tions of simian mothers, perhaps grafted
on to many varieties of simian of differing
degrees of ferocity, all apparently the same
age and all capable of bearing, children (or
monkdren, or chilmonks), it is certain that
a line would have to be drawn somewhere,
and the cradle broken up for firewood. The
talented inventor declares that his treat-
ment has already been tried, and has done
marvels in the restoration of youth and
beauty, with no counterbalancing bad
effects. But even if the lady who has been
monkeyfied only once shows good effects,
there remains the possibility that the one
who has been monked, say, twenty-five
times in a century may develop dreadful
characteristics, and take to mothering in-
fants worse than herself.
Apparently each of our poor but arboreal
relations amounts to only one helping, in
the same way as a sheep only amounts to
one breakfast of sheep’s kidneys, though the
arboreal relation is alleged to live on while
the sheep doesn’t. So there is the chance
of depreciated apes supplying inferior or
poisonous progeny, which might accelerate
a famine in apes, culminating in no ape at
all. When scarcity set in and developed
into one long fast-day, it is to be assumed
that the girls of 75 and 100 and 125 would
begin to look their real age, either sud-
denly or by instalments, and as they would
form the majority of civilised girls tins
would be a blow: (1) to themselves; (2)
to their husbands in cases where they had
practised the gentle deception of pretend-
ing to be fresh and not preserved girls; and
(3) to civilisation. In fact, it is practically ‘
certain that civilisation would perish of the
shock, and that the white race would lose
its supremacy for ever.
And if the multitudinous and simul-
taneous dead were told at. the Gates Above
that their reserved seats had been given
away because, like the Hobbs Millions, they
had been left so long unclaimed, the shock
would spread beyond the bounds of earth
and repercuss among the stars.
The Bible records a long list of miracles,
but the making of an old person young or
the indefinite prolongation of life isn’t
among them.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Film-Censor Bruce.
Stanley Baldwin having decided that it
is quite improper that the English people
should see an English film depicting the
execution of an English, nurse by German
soldiers, the Priminister has had no diffi-
culty in arriving at the conclusion that the
picture should •be banned in Australia also.
Boiled down his objections are: (1) That
it is historically not quite accurate; (2)
that it is calculated to revive dislike of
the Hun and his methods; (3) that it
would re-open a “controversy” concerning
the propriety or otherwise of the shooting
of Nurse Cavell; (4) that in view of an
impending treaty for the outlawry of war
to which Britain and Germany may be
subscribers, the less publicity given to in-
cidents in the last war the better.
This is all very nice and large and
gentlemanly, but what the Australian pub-
lic will want to know is whether these prin-
ciples are to be applied only when British
films are under censorship, or whether
foreign films will have to toe the line. If
a British film may not be shown in Aus-
tralia because, however “unobjectionable
as a film,” to quote Chief-Censor Osborne,
it may offend some foreign nation by re-
minding it of facts it would like to forget,
should not some attention be paid to
foreign films that very bitterly offend Aus-
tralian sentiment by presenting fictions
that falsify fact?
There was an American film shown
throughout Australia whose lesson for us
was that German war-prisoners were haloed
martyrs while French poilus were licentious
beasts. Then there was a clever piece of
Bolshevik propaganda which, if it did not
raise international animosities, did its
damnedest, in a discreet fashion, to preach
the class war and bloody revolution. Mr.
Bruce didn’t make any objection to these
films—possibly because good Mr. Baldwin
hadn’t given any lead on the subject.
Neither has there been any objection ro
the deluge of Yankee war-films which pur-
port to show how Uncle Samuel won the
war. “Historically not quite accurate”
would be a very inadequate reproach to
apply to those precious productions. They
have annoyed every Digger and every good
Australian who have sat and looked at
them, and they re-opened a much more
acrimonious controversy than any that
could possibly have raged around the very
plain and admitted facts surrounding Nurse
Caveli/s execution.
If Mr. Bruce’s deliverance means any-
thing we should have no more war-films of
any sort, and must pretend, as far as we
can, that there never was any Great War,
and • that the iron law of “military neces-
sity” was never invoked to bring about the
death of patriotic and noble women. But
fortunately such incidents are not forgot-
ten. They make a strong backbone for
that movement to outlaw war which Mr.
Bruce so warmly espouses.

One Way to Make Progress.
On the last trip of the Morinda from Syd-
ney to Papua the boat called in at Cairns,
as usual, to pick up mails, passengers and
any cargo which might be offering; but of
cargo the only booking was 14 bundles of
lattice for Samarai. The shipping eo.
advised the shippers that to put these few
bundles of sticks aboard it must engage a
gang of men, and of course the freight
would not warrant that expense. The
consignors then sent their representative to
interview the shipping co., which could only
say that if the bundles were put aboard, the
Morinda would carry them. The next call
was at the office of the Waterside Workers
of the ' port, where the position was ex-
plained to the president and secretary. An
academical discussion followed as to whether
there was no way round or under or
through the impasse, but nothing could be
done without referring the matter to
Townsville.
In the ordinary course, apart from the
freight, the shipping co. would charge 3s.
9d. for handling these 14 bundles of light


lattice; but by the regulations imposed
by the Waterside Workers a co. is debarred
from engaging labor unless it puts on a
ship’s gang comprising 17 men and pays
them for a minimum of two hours. As
these men are paid at the rate of 3s. 2d.
per hour, this would amount to £5 7s. Bd.;
the gang employed would comprise 11 men
in the ship, four trucking on the wharf
and two at the ship’s slings! All to put
on board 14 bundles of lattice, which any
ordinary youth can handle two bundles at
a time!
The unfortunate shippers suggested that
a couple of men might carry the stuff
aboard for £1 apiece; but, whilst admitting
that this would be very liberal pay, it
could not be permitted. Nor could the
carter be allowed to put his load straight
on board. And the idea of the shippers’
employee carrying it on board himself was
not to be thought of for a moment.
There was a time when there was quite
a trade between Cairns and Papua. Little
by little, however, it was discouraged, until
all that remained for one ship was 14
little bundles of sticks. Now that even the
14 little bundles of sticks have been left
behind, presumably the Waterside Workers
are quite happy.
And Australia—who cares about Aus-
tralia !

The Tin Hare.
One of the Slang Government’s presents
to the struggling N. S. Wales proletariat
was the privilege of betting on the pursuit
of the tin hare. As was the case with so
many.other blessings rained on the workers
when Labor ruled in Macquarie-street and
at the Town Haul, the gift was bestowed in
a peculiar way. Legislation expressly per-
mitting bookmakers to ply their noxious
trade on tin-hare grounds was introduced
by the anti-capitalist Ministry, but failed
of a majority in the Leg. Council. Before
long the Ministry was
reconstructed, and
the new crowd (affec-
tionately known as
“the Scabinet”) an-
nounced that it had
been convinced by
arguments that legis-
lation was unneces-
sary, chasing the tin
hare being coursing
within the meaning
of the Gaming and
Betting Act, 1912.
So it began issuing
licenses (in effect,
betting licenses) to
dog-racing companies
which sprang up all
over the place. It
was still issuing licen-
ses when the electors
took it by the slack
of the pants and shot
it into outer darkness.
Now the State Full
Court, in a unani-
mous judgment, has
declared in effect that
the Slangs were
wrong—that tin-hare-
chasing is not cours-
ing within the mean-
ing of the 1912 Act,
and that betting on
it is illegal. The tin-
hare people say they
will appeal, and the
Bavinshaw Govern-
ment has promised
that, until the appeal
is decided one way or another, they will not
be interfered with. It is a miserably weak
attitude. The Government should have
done in its first session what was done by
the other State Governments, three of them
Labor. Those Governments took the stand
that there was more than enough betting
in Australia without the tin-hare variety,
and that in any case the tin-hare gentry had
no more right to have betting made legal
on their premises, so that they might grow
fat on the profits, than the controllers of
football, cricket and cycling grounds and
public tennis-courts.

Small Sister Goes Voting.
The poll in Tasmania was larger than the
sparse attendances at meetings had sug-
gested, and the handful of votes which gave
the Lyons Labor Government control three
years ago dropped this time on the other
side of the fence. When the last vote had
been counted, there were 15 Nationalists.
14 Laborites and an Independent with
Nationalist leanings. Labor lost a seat in
Denison to a Nationalist and one in
Franklin to the Independent, Pearsall.
So McPhee displaces Lyons as Premier;
but unless he can prevail upon a Laborite
to accept the Speakership (worth only £225
p.a.), which is in the highest degree un-
likely, his Government will be dependent
on the uncertain favor of Pearsall, as a
previous Government was dependent on the
uncertain favor of Whitsitt. Proportional
representation plays these tricks.
Of the five electorates the most interest-
ing was Denison, where McPhee topped
the poll. The position here was compli-
cated by the big primary vote polled by an
Independent Laborite, Mahoney, but the
Labor vote was as solid as usual and the
Ind. Lab. did not secure election. In Frank-
lin ex-Attorney General Ogilvie polled in
advance of his huge total of last election,
which was five ahead of the Premier’s
vote, in Wilmot. This year, however,
Lyons’s vote was ahead of Ogilvie’s.
When the Franklin figures were posted
at the Mercury office, the Hobart crowd
demonstrated wildly in favor of Ogilvie.
Next morning the High Court gava the
Tas. Law Society leave to appeal against
the refusal of the Tas. Full Court to strike
Ogilvie, who is a K.C., off the roll of
solicitors.

Make Marriage More Difficult.
“Marko”: I would like to say to “Dom
Lee” (B. 6/6/’2B) that it is just because I
didn’t take the trouble at the age of 22 to
“inquire into the real meaning of mar-
riage” that I want to see it made much
more difficult, so that others may be
forced to make such inquiry, or that they
may be made to wait until they are more
grown-up and have had opportunities. of
seeing that there is a meaning worth inquiry.
At 28 a man is likely to be more sensible
and tolerant than at any earlier age, and
I would be inclined to favor legislation to
prevent a man marrying under that age.
“Dom Lee” needn’t try to put into my
mouth definitions of marriage at which I
never even hinted, especially while she
dodges giving a definition herself. But if
I were asked to give a definition I would
say the ideal state of matrimony was made
up of 50 parts toleration, 30 parts personal
regard of the platonic sort, and 20 parts
sexual appeal. These together comprise
what is called “love”; but the pre-marriage
problem is to estimate whether the apparent
existence of these attributes in a member
of the other sex is genuine or whether their
possession is only assumed for temporary
use. The trouble with most marriages that
fail is that one party or the other has been
persistently posing during the engagement
period, and is compelled to drop the pose
and become natural as soon as the ceremony
is over. Why this should be so I cannot
“And when the pie was opened
The birds began to sing.”
think, but there is no doubt that many a
man has woke up within a week of his
wedding to the fact that his wife is not the
woman who was his fiancee,
Too many women and girls are also m-
dined to regard the church ceremony,
with its wedding-dress, bouquets brides-
maids, etc., as the culminating point of the r
lives, instead of merely a stepping-stone
Cut out the wedding ceremony, with its
side-issues and frills, and there d be fewer
unhappy marriages.
But tae question is as to whether or no,
it should be made easier for people who

dition, and if through no fault of either,

Political Parties in Victoria,
—;
The trouble with the anti-Labor elements
in Victoria is, as it has been for years, poor
leadership. Harry Lawson could never
control his party in Parliament, and in-
trigue got such a long start that it could
never be caught and stamped out. In
normal circumstances Labor would not
have the ghost of a chance of carrying on.
But it is difficult to see how it is to be
displaced. Gray and Forrest are ready
to eat out of the hand of the Age, whose
decline has been arrested by its obvious
authority over the Hogan Government and
its Liberal bedfellows.
One way of giving Victoria the brand
of politics' it voted for would be by dis-
placing McPherson. It is painful to see
this fine, frank Scotsman, this astute busi-
ness man, in a part which he is so unfitted
by training and character to portray; his
party hungers for a leader with less cau-
tion, perhaps, but more inspirational force.
His successor, however, is not easy to pick.
Argyle might do, if he could cultivate more
friendliness. He has commonsense, and
would probably put the trucklers and in-
triguers under discipline. Macfarlan is
too new in Parliament, though he is
destined to play an important part. Kent
Hughes, too, must also serve a longer
apprenticeship.
The Victorian Parliament is woefully
weak, and has been for years. There is no
debating ability in the Assembly, and little
in the Council. The Hogans have done
things, but that means that they have
merely given effect to certain works that
their opponents were too languid to put into
operation. Their leader is no genius, but
he is not so dull as not to realise that
actions speak louder than words.
Parliament meets this month, and party
meetings and “conversations” are sure to
take place. A quiet word in McPherson s
ear to put more vigor into his leadership
or get out would be the kind of conversa-
tion that opponents of Socialism and Red
Raggery would appreciate.
Enley and Is At.
The picturesque ’Enley, who M.L.A.’s for
Burwood in the N.S.W. Assembly, lately
made another speech. A sample follows:
“The suggestion that we should have free
trade with our old Motherland opens the
road back to tariff sanity The family
duty owed by us to our Motherland is to
do a little more than shout ‘Buy Empire
Products’ by making it more possible to
buy them. In the name of our great and
abiding heritage, pull down the barrier to
trade with ‘our ain folk’ or stop prating
about buying Empire goods.”
It is orthodox Freetrade; but—does ’Enley,
M.L.A., really pay for his hat?
The habitual proceeding, at any rate,
has been to pay the local retailer in local
paper which is no earthly use to the man
in England who makes and exports hats.
The retailer paid the wholesaler in the
same currency, and the wholesaler
approached the bank with it and a lot
more of the same sort, and asked for a
draft on London for the amount, payable
in gold. The bank knew that it wasn’t the
least use applying to the innumerable
’Enleys to hand out actual money or
money’s worth.
’Enley’s present imported hat was thus
probably paid for out of the £45,000,000 or
more which this country has borrowed
abroad in the past 11 months, and a pre-
vious one out of the £51,200,000 it raised
the same way in 1923-24, and another,
wholly vanished now, out of the £42,200,000
similarly cadged in 1921-22. Mr. ’Enley’s
grandchildren may be still struggling with
the interest bill in their old age. The
Bulletin doesn’t see much practical
patriotism in giving the Old Man of Lon-
don lOU’s for its clothing, so it buys its
hat of local manufacture, wherever pos-
sible, and pays in money which is of real
value to the local manufacturer.
Some day, if the transport unions con-
trive to put a Communist Government
solidly in power, the public debt will be
repudiated (unless outside forces intervene)
on real Moscow principles, and the more
burdensome it is the more support a de-
fault, movement is likely to get. Then the
Motherland may wish that ’Enley, M.L.A.,
had bought his hat elsewhere.

Uncle Sam Is a Poor Shylock.
Crawford Vaughan writes:—
As one who enjoyed the official hospitality
of Uncle Sam for 12 months I feel impelled
to point out that he is not the Shylock
he has been pictured. The net original
principal war debts of Europe to America
(excluding Russia and Armenia) reached
$9,811,094,094. Funded interest amounted to
$1,711,259,905—a total of $11,522,354,000.
The payments to be received under the
various funding agreements, discounted to
present values on the basis of 4 p.c., payable
semi-annually, amount to $7,440,009,000, or
only 60 p.c. of the original obligations.
The Shylock that lets his debtors off 40
p.c. of the bond —in this case $4,082,354,000
—is the kind of Uncle that doesn’t grow
three apples over his^oor.
Why Ships Run Ashore.
“X.N.0.”: “El Marinero’s” hectic picture
(B. 6/6/’2B) of the mate of a ship “taking
bearings and soundings and plotting off on
the chart, etc.,” is graphic, but misleading,
inasmuch as these things never have to be
all done at the same time. If bearings of
land on a charted coast can be obtained
there is no need to take soundings because
the bearings fix the position with absolute
accuracy. It is when the position is un-
certain—and it always is uncertain when
out of sight of land—that soundings should
be taken to verify or disprove the supposed
position.
“El Marinero’s” idea of a man-o’-war
“with several spare officers on the bridge”
is equally inaccurate. In the biggest
British warship afloat there is normally only
one officer on the
bridge. The naviga-
tor comes up now
and again to take
sights and keep an
eye on things in
general, and the cap-
tain also puts in an
appearance, though
taking no part in the
actual practical work
of navigation.
I fail entirely to see
that, beyond the com-
pulsory provision of
an up-to-date sound-
ing machine, costs are
going to be increased
by taking normal
precautions. But if
that is the reason
these precautions are
not taken, the posi-
tion is even more
scandalous than I
thought.

The Press and the
Law.
Marie Stopes having
made some remarks
about Mr. X which a
jury under the reins
and whip of Justice
Avory considered to
- worth £2OO, the
tor of the London
New Statesman
printed some quite
mild comments on the possible lack of judicial
comments on the possible lack of judicial
temperament in the said Avory, J. The
pertinent aspect of this utterance is that
it was made after verdict. Forthwith
descended the bludgeon of the Crown,
wielded by the Attorney-General himself,
in the guise of an action for contempt, upon
the head of the editor. It was argued on
his behalf that the Judge was only a human
being, open to criticism like any other
human being; but the Bench gave birth
to a judgment to the effect that it is .n
the public interest that the judiciary should
be left alone even after verdict. The
judgment overlooks the obvious fact that
it is equally in the public interest, if a
Judge is a bad Judge, that both he and
the public should be so informed.
Per contra, as the countiy grocer and
egg-dealer says, lusty cheers should burst
from all editors, whether their publications
be of the deepest vermilion or just plain
S. M. Herald, at the decision in Rex v.
the Editor of the Daily Mail. No more
can the magsman, with a prospectus in
every pocket, muzzle the inquisitive press-
man by the issue of a writ with whieh it
is obvious to everybody he does not pro-
pose to proceed. One Jacob Factor, being
in the language of the Daily Mail ‘‘a
bogus solicitor... .a notorious share pusher,
who found England too hot for him....an
arch swindler”.... it said so in just those
terms both before and after the issue of his
writ for libel. Lord Hewart, C.J., and
Justices Avory and Branson, of the King’s
Bench Division, being asked by our old
friend Rex to prevent this naughtiness on
the part of the Daily Mail after the issue
of the worthy Jacob’s writ, said in very
plain English that judges and juries were
entitled to take into consideration whether
Factor’s writ was of the genuine or “stop”
variety; and, having decided that it was
the latter, the Court sent Rex off with \
flea in his ear.

POLITICAL
POINTS
After months of torpor, during which the
marine cook union bosses absolutely refused
to put their new claims before the Arbitra-
tion Court, or to take a ballot of their own
members, or to be anything short of a law
!o themselves and to Australia, the Bruee-
l’age Government announced its resolve to
sec the Crimes Act working by proclamation.
This law makes the contumacious striker or
strike-promoter liable to 12 months’ gaol, and
to deportation if he is an imported nuisance
instead of one locally born. It ought to
work if the Federal authority has the neces-
sary police to make arrests, and if there are
Federal courts in which to prosecute, and if
prosecutions are numerous and energetic,
and if the appeal system doesn’t, hang pro-
ceedings up indefinitely, and if no court
drives a horse and cart through the Act, and
if there is a Federal gaol or two to put
anybody in.
A feature which makes the present marine
upheaval different from the common run is
that the Sydney and Melbourne sea cooks,
who caused it all, are to a great extent work-
ing and earning wages. They are a small
body, representing, however badly in some
cases, a branch of industry which is always
in demand, and a sea cook can be so easily
disguised as a land cook that his own dog
wouldn't know the difference. Meanwhile
the mass of seamen, firemen and watersiders
have no second string to their bow, and
put up with the situation as best they can.
Australia has somehow contrived to
import about 13 millions’ worth less than
it did last year, but it. is still bringing in
many things which it ought to be producing
on its own account. The country has to
find its salvation in the reduction of imports,
which is easy if the matter is tackled
courageously.
The N.S.W. Parliament has sent Albert
Gardiner hack to the Senate to fill the
vacancy left by the late Jack Grant, though
the; A.L.P. bosses commanded it to elect
their Arthur Rae. In humble obedience to
the nasty little tyrants who give him orders,
Rang moved that thei’e should be open voting,
only to be reminded., with grins, that he had
demanded secret voting on a similar occasion
four years ago. On that occasion, Senator
Allan McDougall having died, Lang nomin-
ated J. M. Power, stressing the fact that
Power was a leader in the struggle against
conscription. Four months later, Power
being no more, he recommended W. A. Gibbs
to the Houses —as a returned soldier!
N. S. Wales financial returns for eleven
months show that the State’s “business under-
takings” (railways, etc.) yielded £548,917
more than in the previous year. Unfortu-
nately it cost £1,110,617 more in working
expenses and £951.245 more in interest on
loan money, or £2,061,862 in all, to produce
the £848,917.
The Cocky crowd continues to be the X
party of Vic. State politics. There was an
understanding that it would appoint a Com-
mittee to confer with a Nat. bunch about
the consolidation of the non-Labor forces,
but it changed its mind, suggesting instead
that its leader 4 Allan) and deputy-leader
(Walter) should meet McPherson and Pea-
cock to hear what they had to say. Mc-
Pherson, humorously called Opposition
leader, has a tough job trying to keep in any
sort of order the 32 he leads. He would be
much happier running the Treasury under a
strong chief Avith a liking for politics.
A recent complaint was about the shorten-
ing of employment for stonemasons through
the arrival in Sydney of a big consignment
of red granite quarried and dressed abroad.
There is a lavish variety of excellent building
material here, still huge boulders are habitu-
ally dragged from the ends of the earth
just for the insane joy of saying they are
not our own . products. Nearly £200,000
went out in the last nine months for foreign
“marble, slate and other stone.” This is
a fine item to put on the import prohibition
list, when Australia gets one.
In the financial year 1926-27 the Common-
wealth paid out oA'er three-quarters of a
million in bounties—£77l,39s to be exact.
Wane accounted for £442,410, of which
£329,662 went to South Aus. Manufacturers
of wire-netting and fencing-wire received
£188,687, and makers of galvanised sheets
collected £67,915. Sulphur-production Avas
bountied to the extent of £34,389. At the
tail of the list comes a firm that manufac-
tures traction-engines. It got a bonus of
£250.
When a reporter broke the neAvs that Gar-
diner had been appointed to the Senate in-
stead of Rae, an angry gentleman named
Graves, described as president of the N. S.
Wales A.L.P., said: “By his action in
opposing the selected Labor candidate Gar-
diner has automatically placed himself out-
side ‘the movement.’ ” The same Rae opposed
three selected Labor candidates at the Senate
election of 1922, one of them being the late

The Tasmanian Cabinet which is passing
out has some matters to its credit. The
loan expenditure for its last three years was
225. 3d., 295. 9d. and 80s. Bd. per inhabitant
respectively, whereas the average of the six
States was 102 s. lQd., 114 s. 6d. and 120 s. 3d.
per inhabitant. Instead of Tas. being well
up to the average as a loan-spender it was
made a model (Australian variety) of solvent
finance. Lyons and Co- managed to produce

Hamilton, in Victoria’s rich west. Avas
proclaimed a town on June 2. It had been
a borough since 1863. In the intervening
65 years the population has perhaps doubled
—it is about 5500 now. During 20 years of
that period Coburg grew from shire, to city,
its population increasing from 6700 to 18,100.
But Coburg is, of course, a suburb of the
Big City, whereas Hamilton is merely the
centre of one of the most fertile regions in
Australia, Avith a neglected port of its own.
In the most recent of the juicy cases Avhicli
the late Slangwhang croAvd prepared for
the legal profession, the N.S.W. Full Court,
has ruled that chasing the tin hare is not

and Betting Act, 1912. The Slangwhang
Scabinet said it was, and issued a number
of licenses to Friends of the Movement, with
the result that betting on the unsavory
“sport,” iioav declared illegal, has reached
vast proportions. Slaugwhang’s newspaper-
tax Avas adjudged unconstitutional. So Avas

it attempted to over-ride Federal awards.
And his tax on film profits, though the inten-

But don’t blame them.
Victoria is the smallest and far the best-
populated of the mainland States, but
asinine Governments put more soldier
settlers on its insufficient space than Queens-
land arid Westralia combined did on their
wide expanses. One- victim lately got Jiis
simple tale into the press. Its burden was
that he married two years ago and that his
wife invested her little dowry in the farm,
which ate it up. He remains on under
notice to quit for non-payment of instal-
ments', but isn't allowed, to put in a crop,
and the effort to live oil rabbits is a failure
owing to insufficient bunny. If certain well-
meaning fools had realised at repatriation
time that, under decent conditions, there
was more room and more, need for factory
hands than for an artificially-created peas-
antry it would have been a blessed cir-
cumstance.
The Australian Scots who went touring
home to their native banks and braes are
being received with warmth and _ much
haggis, but they haven’t much to give in
return. Their old friends appear to inquire
unanimously about favorable openings in
this part of the world, and that is a difficult
subject at present. There is the opening in
the floor wherein, as a Sydney Royal Com-
missioner has been informed, ex-Alderman
Green’s wife kept £1500 stowed away for
ten years, thus losing £75 p.a. interest, and
the sea-cooks’ strike opened three months
ago, and union boss Tudehope lias been
opening his mouth a great deal too wide,
and Treasurer Page will shortly have to
open a new loan. But such things as new
ports, and new towns, and a transcon-
tinental railway, and a big freehold settle-
ment area in the N. Territory remain
obstinately shut.
In pursuance of the inquiry into the affairs
of Bunglebungle by the Public Accounts
Committee, one of the ruling triumvirate,
Commissioner Thomas, mentioned that the
loss on the Government’s 10 dry hostels and
hotels was £124,904 up to time of speaking.
He thought they might pay if residents could
get their drink there instead of buying il
from Private Enterprise at Queanbeyan, a
few miles away, in N.S.W. lie added that
the three main drought-pubs, the Canberra,
Acton and Kurrajong, “were built more to
satisfy aesthetic tastes than with a view to
actual business prospects.” No private
builder, he said, would have put up a place
like the Hotel Canberra “unless lie was mad.”
The remark was rough on public builders.
A popular though unwritten doctrine is
that the loan money is so easy that it doesn’t
matter much what any public work costs.
So it is alleged as quite in tin- day's work
that the Newcastle floating dock (which is
partly State and partly Federal) will cost
much more than the estimated £490,099, and
that a channel must be dredged and kept
open so that big ships can get to the dock —
a matter which was unfortunately over-
looked. Losses and blunders are of minor
importance if they are paid off out of revenue
and finished with, but mostly they are added
to the public debt, to accumulate at com-
pound interest.
Clapp, who bosses Vic. railways—when
the politicians let him—would go further
than Auditor-General Norris in writing down
capital. Norris suggested £15,000,000; Clapp
would make it £10 590,000. Of course, the
taxpayer would have to continue to provide
the interest on the £.15,000,000 or £10,500,009
but Clapp maintains that a trifle over
£50,000 a year for half a century would
wipe out the whole liability. In the. mean-
time, if he had his way, the railways would
be building up a reserve fund to level up
ihings in lean years. Hogan’s Royal Commis-
sion is digesting the suggestions of Norris,
Clapp and others.
The mercurial Joshua Thomas Hoskins
Whitsitt had another shot for Darwin at
the Tasmanian election. He represented the
district in tin 1 State Assembly from 1909 to
1922 and in the Federal Reps, from 1922 to
1925. Darwin decided that it could do with-
out him for another three years.
The s.s. Jervis Bay got away with some
trifling difficulty on its last voyage under
the Government flag. When the ships re-
appear under their new ensign it is feared
that the fat will be in the fire on a large
scale. 8. M. Bruce, who insisted on retain-
ing the bones of contention in these waters,
has declared that he won’t put up with the
threatened industrial conflagration, but the
needful ferocity may be wanting.
The Bavinsliaw Ministry is insisting on the
lodger or door-key franchise in N.S.W. local
government. This fad, made law by the State's
worst Labor Ministry, is one of the reasons
wily the city of Sydney has at present no
Council and no municipal vote at all. Pre-
parations are being openly made to put it
to the same uses in the country which it
served in the city. Nobody knew that the
person with the nominal tenancy of a bed
within the municipal boundaries would be
outrageously wronged if he was minus the
municipal suffrage—not even the bedder
himself—until political leaders broke the
news to him, and he possibly didn’t fully
realise the position even then till he was
instructed to hire a doss in the city and
oualify for a loan job at Bunnerong. The
Buttiushaws may be influenced by the threat
that the withdrawal of a franchise, once
granted, will be held up to reprobation as
an act of unparalleled tyranny, but as every-
thing they do is called an unprecedented
outrage one more horror doesn’t matter.
Striking is now one of Australia’s lead-
ing industries, and there is a robust con-
tinuity about it which other industries lack.
Whitburn colliery (Newcastle) had been idie
all the year save for 14 days, but when the
Government gave it an SOO-ton order as
relief work a strike began immediately be-
cause a deputy was instructed to work from

the purpose of making an inspection.

Slow to praise us, and swift to blame,
Daily our mentors voice their distress,
And friends in earnest and friends in name,
Shed large tears o’er our waywardness.
I’audits gibber and pedants quote,
Prophets are telling their tales of woe,
Ghouls are getting them ready to gloat,
While all we ask is a dinkum go.
Never a day but a wondrous plan
From some new Sinai we receive
With exhortations, until a man
Is lost in the tangle of words they weave.
We who have wandered ’midst creeds that
cloy
Tire at last of the empty show;
Nothing we find there can match the joy
Of giving and getting a dinkum go.
While pendants figure and zealots burn
To guide our feet in the new-found ways,
Gladly and simply do we return
To the old, old truth that a square deal
pays.
So we leave their schemes to our mentors
wise;
We cannot follow them, for we know
No joy to equal the joy that, lies
In giving and getting a dinkum go.

In 1918 the 11.1. C. raided my house be-

shoved against our backs, because we were

“Bert the Carpenter” : A big car, a small
car, a bicycle, a horse and trap and a motor-
bicycle and side-car were ranged in front of
an Adelaide suburban pub. The big car
backed out, a tram struck it and sent it
flying into the small car, which cannoned
into the bicycle and smashed it into two
nieces. The horse reared up, came down. on

“4X2”: Among my treasured war
souvenirs is a copy of XVIII Corps ] Daily

containing the item that an attack on a
large front would be launched against us
on the early morning of March 21. The
document finishes with a line added by
Corps H.Q.: “Prisoners who are Alsatians

their information was we were to learn
within 24 hours. I found the Summary

of billets, put in in my tunic pocket and
forgot all about it. A few days later it
fell out of my tunic in an English hospital
and the same day 1 read in the press that
Hun H.Q. had issued orders that in future
no Alsatians were to be allowed to be in

“J.11.T.”: The old-time Fremantle pub-
lican who named his house “His Lordship’s

Scot. Anyhow, the original, an ancient hos-
telry, stands in St. Enoch Square, Glasgow.
For more than a century it was the “liowff”
of the farmers who assembled every Wed-
nesday (the old market day) in the Square.
The farmers have long since vanished, but
the Larder still flourishes in a modernised
setting.

: The theory that excessive wine-
drinking accounts for the low birth-rate in
France (B. 30/5/’2S) is rather far-fetched.
Small families in France are due to the
extent to which contraception is practised.
Preventives of all sorts are freely advertised
and sold. If there is anything in the theory,
does it apply .to wine alone, and not to other
alcoholic drinks? I knocked about a few
French cities during the war, and the number
of drunks to be seen was far fewer in pro-
portion than in English and Australian
cities. In my opinion, more drinking goes
on in Melbourne after six o’clock than in
Paris, with three times the population and
cafes open till 11 p.in.

“Claude W.” : What has happened to the
Royal Company Islands? In 1840 the French
explorer D’Urville reported the dis-
covery of this cluster of islands 600
miles south of Tasmania, but they
have, never been heard of since.
Some time ago an American ship
carried out a magnetic survey of
the South Seas, but her officers re-
ported that they failed to find even
a rock where the islands were sup-
posed to exist. It has been sug-
gested that D’Urville mistook the
position of the islands, but there
is not another group within hun-
dreds of miles of the position he
allocated to the Royal Company
group. They are shown on most
large maps as being situated be-
tween Tasmania and the Antarctic.

intrigued to notice what appears to be an
angler standing in the water, rod find line
held well over the stream. The canoe swerves
from its course, a deck-hand snatches at the
line, and a bundle of letters is flung aboard,
a performance that is repeated at intervals
all through the precipitous middle reach of
the river. Occasionally tlie line swings out
a basket, into which, a package is dropped,
or supplies are deposited on projecting
rocks at the foot of cliffs, hundreds of feet
in height. During the whole of the 60
miles of the gorge-like middle reach of the
Wanganui there is no sign of habitation,
though the river runs through populated
country, and it is only the mailman or a
settler in need of some commodity who
descends the cliffs to intercept the river

Athenic, the Corinthic and the lonic arrived

biggest steamers to visit Maoriland at that
time and for some time after. I remember
going on board the Athenic and being per-
sonally conducted by a loquacious greaser
through her engine and boiler rooms, and
being told tales of firing on the fast Atlantic
trips. The man had left one of the Cunard
fliers to join the Athenic for a rest cure.
He had amazing descriptive powers and the
long bow bent a bit as he talked. But he
fired me with an idea, and I sat up that
night writing “Stokin’,” which gave me ray
first leg-in with The Bulletin. The
Athenic was in Australia last year, after
making a slow trip from Southhampton,

“Wang” : The origin of “No good to Gundy”

years ago. The most favored explanation
was that, at a time when flood wrnters
threatened the town of Gundagai, an abo.,
who was asked what he thought of it, replied
that “it was no good to Gundy.” There
are many sayings in common use the origin
of which is obscure. Most people seem to
think “Gone to the pack” is derived from
the game of poker. But a Canadian friend
of mine told me the phrase is of local origin,
and refers to a domesticated wild dog going
back to its former companions who roam in
packs.

neither the sergeant or constable could drive,
but the former was quite ready to decide
whether I could. The car supplied to me
should never have been allowed to leave
the police-station, the hand-brake, foot-brake
and hooter being all shockingly in need of
repair. I can only attribute my success in
obtaining a license to the fact that I didn’t
kill any dogs or tip the sergeant into a
ditch when reversing.

two Kennedy brothers and McGill, original
owners of Mundrabilla station, and they
travelled overland from Adelaide to Eucla,
over 50 years ago, with sheep and cattle,
shearing being done on the way. When
Eucla became a station on the Transconti-

in the district, and did most of the doctor-

“Ibn cl Issar”: However little use the

milk, is as old as the dawn of history, and
is often mentioned in the Vedas, the sacred
writings of Brahminism. The stuff was and
is a favorite offering to the gods, as well as
a general food. “Alex.” (B. 9/5/’2B) seems
inclined to doubt whether curdled milk
could have intoxicating properties. This is
dinkum, however; the koumiss of the Tartar
is made from fermented mare’s milk, and a
passage in Burnaby’s “Ride to Khiva”
suggests that it has as much kick as Aus-

ested. The boat chugged on. “That is Goat
Island.” It wasn’t, and I couldn’t stand it
any longer. “Excuse me,” I butted in, “that
is Ball’s Head ; Goat Island is behind you.”
The B.F. half-turned, froze my blood to ice
with a stony glare, and. turned again to
her companion. “As I was saying ,” she
said, “that is Goat Island.” She said it so
convincingly that I’m still wonderjing if the
blessed point isn’t Goat Island.

Arthur Griffith’s story:—The statement of
a prominent Sydney cleric that every Christian
man and woman should vote for prohibi-
tion recalls the most devastating sfaub ever
handed out to a well-meaning deputation.
It was when, as vice-president of the Busi-
ness Men’s Efficiency League, the first plank
of whose platform was prohibition (with full
compensation), I was a member of a depu-
tation which called on Octavius Beale to
invite him to join our executive. Our presi-
dent introduced the matter very nicely,
explaining our objective and informing Mr.
Beale that a man of his w-ide experience
and high reputation would, etc., etc. 0.C.8.

our spokesman if he thought, as a Christiau,
he could support an organisation whose
first plank amounted to a censure on his
Redeemer, the first of whose miracles on
earth was to make wine. This entirely unex-
pected answer left the deputation gasping—
too flabbergasted even to reply. I think
I Was the only member of it whose withers
were unwrung, and I took the opportunity
of explaining that X didn’t advocate prohibi-
tion on moral or religious grounds, but
on the economic ground that a small debt-
encumbered population of two millions of
people can’t afford to spend a hundred-
million pounds every 10 years on a waste
product, when the money is badly needed
to buy better food, clothing and accommo-
dation for the half-million children in the
State. But my advocacy, on this occas.on
was also a waste product. 0.C.8. remained
Unmoved.

“F.T.Ii.”: Here’s a relationship problem
which takes some unravelling. Twenty-
seven years ago a father and son married
two sisters. Dad and the lad became
brothers-in-law, and the sister who married*
the old man became step-mother to the son,
who thus became the step-son of his sister-
in-law. Complications increased when a son
was born to one couple and a daughter to
the other. Within the last few months the
daughter of one family and the son of the
other have married—how they got a license I
don t know, but they did—and parenthood
for them is in sight. What will be the re-
lationship of their child to the original father
and son and the sisters they 'married?

i "C"**": In the early days of the war
shell-shock eases were indiscriminately lumped
together as frequently punished
as such. Right up to the middle of
1915, when the persistent recur-
rence of well-defined clinical symp-
toms caused the R.A.M.C. to recog-
nise the existence of a new and
definite neurosis, men found wan-
dering about behind the lines in a
dazed and nerve-shattered state
were liable to be shot as deserters
by both British and French. In
January, 1915, the French actually
executed 17 men in a batch who
were mostly if not entirely shell-
shock cases, and who would have
been diagnosed as such a year later.
Such posthumous reparation as was
possible was subsequently made by
transferring the executed men’s
names to the list of “Killed in
action,” and by the granting of
pensions to their dependants. In
the A.I.F. there were only three
eases of men being discharged as
useless through fear, and although
the. cause of their discharge was
plainly stated on their medical his-
tory papers the Repatriation
Department drew no distinctions with them,
so far as benefits were concerned.

“B-Gar”: Touching those horses we took
to Egypt and Palestine (B. 6/6/’2S), this
happened in the busy part of Alexandria in
1916. Two Diggers, after sampling the
city’s liquors, called a native gharry. To
the surprise of the one who was slightly
sober, his mate produced a revolver, and,
staggering up to the nearside prad, ended
its days as a gharry horse. “What did yer
do that for?” the non-combatant asked- “I
brought that old horse over with me,” the
shooter replied, “an’ I’ll do a stretch sooner
than let one of these black cows knock
him about.” A.I.F. Headquarters compen-
sated the Gyppo, and the Digger’s pay-book
showed some red ink.
* * * *
“E. Volt”: At Edithburg (S.A.) the other
day a lead-covered cable was found to have
been penetrated by a borer beetle. Lead was
a substance hitherto believed to be imper-
meable except to a very rare species of
insect. The teredo consistently drilled his
way through submarine cables until it was
discovered that a serving of brass tape spoilt
his appetite.
“Barangkali”: Among ex-German posses-
sions in these seas the island of Nauru has
the unique record of having thrice changed
hands during the war.' After the Sydney
had made an end of the
Emden, and German New
Guinea had been captured,
a warship was despatched to
Nauru, one of the strategic
points in the Pacific where
Germany had erected a tow-
ering wireless station. The
German Governor surren-
dered, the German flag was
hauled down and the Aus-
tralian ensign hoisted in its
stead. On the German resi-
dents undertaking to submit
to Australian control the
warship steamed away, but
it was no sooner out of sight
than the Germans ran up
their own flag again. They
lowered it with some alacrity
when a Japanese cruiser,
fresh from its conquest of
the Carolines, was sighted
by the lookout on the wire-
less mast and replaced it
with the Australian ensign ;
but after the unsuspecting
Jap had steamed by, the
Australian flag was burned on
the Sports Ground, and the
British residents were
ordered aboard a small cargo
vessel and deported to Ocean
Island, then without wire-
less. Two months later, how-
ever, Rabaul was advised of
the turn of the
wheel at Nauru,
and a warship was
sent to straighten
up things. Calling
at Ocean Island it
carried back the de-
portees to Nauru
and reinstated them
in their former posi-
tions. The Germans
were arrested,
taken to Sydney
and interned. An
Australian garrison was left at Nauru, and
a picture of George V. now looks down from
the wall of the Residency where Kaiser
Wilhelm formerly scowled.

“X2X” : On the matter of sobriety tests
(B. 30/5/’2B), why isn’t the simplest and
most decisive test of all more generally
employed? This consists of writing 10 lines
or so at dictation. A drunken individual
writes in a shaky hand with waves and
breaks between the letters, and words are
left out and misspelled. A comparison with
the accused’s normal handwriting leaves!
no room for doubt. The Berlin police employ
this test very successfully.
* * * *
“R.a.L.”: A couple of glaring cases of
motorists clearing out after killing pedes-
trians in Melbourne suburban streets call re-
newed attention to the difficulty of decipher
ing numbers -on a moving car at night.
Officers of the police wireless patrol cars
state that not live per cent, of car rear
numbers are visible at a distance of ten feet
under normal suburban street-lighting con-
’ ditions. For over five years the traffic-
police have advocated transparencies for
rear numbers, lit independently of the red
rear light. They have also persistently
urged that all number plates should be
issued by them, as in N. S. Wales, but
successive Governments have turned a deaf
ear to these and similar suggestions. Until
a prominent Trades Hall leader or a shining
light of the A.W.N.L. gets slaughtered by
a hit-and-run motorist things are likely to
remain as they are.

“C.Q.: Wood-carving, except as a pastime
for leisured spinsters, is almost a dead art
in Australia. The only practitioner 'of
mankind’s earliest craft I have been able to
discover in Melbourne is a German. Forty
years ago he did beautiful stuff, and his
handiwork graced the sideboards and mantel-
pieces of many a stately hall in Toorak.
To-day he ekes out a living making Indian
clubs, tops and dumb-bells, but even in these
lines he is competing against the machine.
The model of a hand lies amongst the
dusty rubbish in his window, and thereby
hangs a tale. The old man enjoyed a brief
revival of prosperity just after the War.
when the disabled Diggers were returning.
Fate was in an ironic mood when she
arranged that live Australian limbs de-
stroyed by German bullets should be restore!
in Australian timbers by a German.

“Sliep” : At Buire, on the Somme, I came
across a German prisoner-of-war doing
roadwork. With snow inches deep on the
ground it came as a shock to be hailed by
a uniformed Fritz with “What about a
surf at Manly to-day?” I found he knew
more about Sydney than I did, having lived
for 14 years there and worked in a big
retail store; he had left for Germany when
reserves were being mysteriously called up
from all over the world just prior to the
outbreak of war. Although captured on the
first day of the Somme push he was any-
thing but downhearted, and looked forward
to returning to an Australia under German
rule.
* * * *
“Manar”: The proportion of non-Aus-
traiian-born members of the A.I.F. (C.
was probably even larger than
official statistics disclose. In my company
the records showed those of non-Australian
birth as being about 10 per cent., but to my
knowledge there were others who put them-
selves down as Australians by birth when
they were not. Some of those born in Bri-
tain or other parts of the Empire probably
reasoned that native-born Australians might
expect preferential treatment in the matter
of pensions, etc., while with Scandinavians.
there was always the pos-
sibility that their own country might h’
ranged against the Allies before the war was
°yer. Many of the latter were unnaturalised
at the time of enlistment, and Australia
missed the chance of a generous gesture
when it neglected to confer citizenship upon
all who served in the A.I.F.
HOP IN WHILE YOU CAN!
[FOR THE BULLETIN]
\ou are old, Father William; your voice
is a wheeze,
But nothing seems wrong with your sight;
For you fix both your eyes on the young
ladies’ knees.
Do you think at your age it is right?”
“In my youth,” Father William replied to
his son,
“I never could get half a chance,
For their skirts touched the floor; now they
nearly have none.
Can you blame me for stealing a glance?”
"But say,” spoke the youth, “don’t you think
the girls’ knees
Should be hidden well under their frocks?
Is it fair that the maidens should do as they
please
While w e poor young men do our blocks?”
“In my youth,” said the Sage, “why, no lady
would dare
To let any man see her er —leg,
But in these happy days you can see ’em and
stare.
Now, do change the subject, I beg.”
"A curious thing,” said the youth with a
laugh,
“Is the way that they manage the gown;
They first raise it high and exhibit the calf
And then, when we look, pull it down.”
“I observe,” quoth the Sage, “the doctors all
say
That the girls are now dressing with sense,
And are getting more rational day after day ;
The prospect is simply immense.
“So, let ’em all go with their skirts high or
low,
And their legs straight, thin, bandy or fat.
I or gilds must be girls and remain statu quo.
Now, what do you know about that?”
“I fear,” said the youth, “we’re wasting a
deal
Of our time, and our talk is in vain.
With one sudden turn of the fashion-god’s
wheel,
They will all become legless again.”

Ivingsford Smith, who with Ulm and the
Iwo Americans, Lyon and Warner, on
Saturday triumphed in the grand flight
from the U.S.A. to Australia, is 31 and a
Brisbaneite. His parents have the true
spirit, too; when the war broke out lie
wanted to enlist at once, but the old people
wouldn’t let him until he was 18. Then he
went, and. after fighting a year or two on
the ground, joined up with the Royal Air
Force in France. Incidentally, it might
console groundlings who avoid flying because
they shiver at the thought of looking from
a height to. know that Ivingsford Smith has
all his life shrunk from looking over the
edges of cliffs or tall buildings. However,
controlling a ’plane while it drops 000
feet or so —as happened in the last stage
of the Pacific flight—is nothing very much
to him.
ALBERT GEORGE OGILVIE, K.C., of
Tasmania, who had a mixed time last
week. The crowd outside the Hobart
MERCURY office sympathetically cheered
its loudest when he was shown to head
the poll for Franklin. Next morning the
High Court gave the Tasmanian Law
Society leave to appeal against the
local Full Court, which refused last
month to strike him off the roll over
some mixed-money matters; his partner,
who had been looking after the business
while Ogilvie attended to politics, com-
mitted suicide when the complication
was discovered.
Ulm. horn in Melbourne, at 16 ran away
from homo and offered himself for enlist-
ment. His man's build easily bluffed the
recruiting officers, and he was among the
greenest fledglings that landed on Gallipoli.
Getting his packet there, he was discharged
as medically unfit, but duly re-enlisted. His
mother is Australian; his father a French-
man. who worked in Talma’s photo studios
in Melbourne.
Kingsford Smith’s hop from California to
Honolulu is tllie fifth successful one. Ameri-
can Air Force Lieutenants Maitland and
llegenberger were the pioneers, flying the dis-
tance in 25hr. oOmin. at the end of June
last year. Their time lias not been beaten.
The following month two civil airmen, Smith
and Bronte, set out for Honolulu and landed
on the island of Molokai, 60 miles to the
south-east, wrecking their plane. In August
two of the Dole race contestants g;ot over.
The rest of the journey has never been
flown before ; the middle section,*from Hono-
lulu to Fiji, is much the toughest:.
The N.S.W. Judiciary is largely descended
from religion. The dads of Justices Harvey,
James and liaise Rogers were . parsons,
aiid the names of Collen and Cantor
suggest a religious ancestry, a Cohen being
a Jewish priest and a Cantor the minister
who chants the services. Australia's first
Chief Justice, Griffith, was a parson's son,
and Way of S.A., the State Chief Justice
with the record length of service, was an-
other. The queer thing is that not one. of

James Murdoch, the Sydney man who
mixes soft-goods and public service, has had
a successful 12 months. As president of the
Civic Reformers he played a strong hand in
securing the commission that is turning over
the Town Hall bed of violets, and he has
had other victories in civic events.
Meanwhile his racehorse, Dion, has won
well in several runs, including the Newcastle
Cup. Then, the other day, came the Birth-
day knighthood.
Time pushes on. The other day Sturt
Griffith, having his Engineering degree,
joined his father’s Sydney firm of consulting
engineers and patent attorneys. The young
man owes his front name to the Broken

Of that early Far-Western group only one
remains in Parliament —Josiali Thomas, of
the Senate. «
The two new S.A. kflights are a pastoralist
and a doctor. John Melrose, of Ulooloo sta-
tion, has been blind for 20 years, but has
carried on with the wool industry just as
before. He helped the Waite Institute (the
agricultural research place at Urrbrae, near
Adelaide) with a timely gift of £10,000 last
year. Dr. Henry Newland comes from South
Australian pioneer stock. (Simpson New-
land, his father, wrote the classic novel of
the Murray-mouth district, “Paving the
Way.”) He won all sorts of surgical honors
at Adelaide University and in London, and
now, at 54, is at the head of the profession
in S.A. He did brilliant war doctoring
at Lemnos and in Egypt and England, and
has an international repute for his plastic
surgery.
Archibald Middlemiss, just dead at Morn-
ington (Vic.), at 89, with his brother unsuc-
cessfully applied to be included in the Burke
and Wills expedition, and a few years later
followed practically the same route as those
ill-fated explorers. Then the goldfields of
Maoriland attracted him, after which he
drifted to Fiji, and subsequently owned gen-
eral stores in Apia, Samoa and Tonga. As
a side-line he tented an island off Tonga
and established a whaling station.
The Perth police have lately interfered
in the private concerns of a curious human
ruin who is known as “The Count” on the
waterfront, where he hawks odd goods. The
Count, a regular at the courts on charges
of drink and sundries, remembers a proud
ancestry whenever a new arrival enters his
family, and he announces in the Perth papers
that the wife of “the Marquis Bonanati,
Prince Dacaia, Duke of Pia'sensa Doge of
Venice, Count of Moya,” lias been delivered.
The last announcement (the sixth) was dur-
ing May; but the police, visiting the home,
found it so far from being a palace that they
took charge of five children.
N.S.W. gets a Rhodes Scholar Judge
through the appointment of P. Halse Rogers,
K.C., who starts his judicial career at 45.
Rogers got the 1905 Rhodes nomination for
N.SAV.; returning he was Associate to Chief
Justice Cullen for a term. His K.C. came
after the minimum 15 years’ practice.
Died last week in Melbourne Aaron Danks,
one of the city’s most noted philanthropists,
Whose work as president of Melbourne Hos-
pital committee earned him a knighthood.
As head of the great Danks hardware house
he was a considerate employer who did not
need Parliamentary acts to force him to do
the fair thing.
Passed on in Sydney at 74, Henry William
Meggitt, founder of that good Australian co.,
Meggitt’s, Ltd. Another big concern in
which lie had a hand was Lever Bros., the
soap people, whose works he established
when he came to Australia in 1895. lie
managed that show for several years before
he started to make things out of linseed at
Parramatta.
The death the other day of Dr. Marshall,
former meeinister of Scots’ Kirk, Collins-
street, Melbourne, recalls that lie succeeded
Charles Strong 40 years ago after the fierce
strife over doctrine in the Presbyterian
Assembly. Strong founded the Australian
Church, formerly in Flinders-strect but now
in Russell-strcet south, and the kindly old
gentleman is still the shepherd. Scots' Kirk
was fortunate in getting Marshall ill those
troublous times. Not only did he con-
solidate his ain church folk, but he became
a force in the religious life of the community.
He was, in fact, the big man Scotchby-
terianism wanted.

“L.J.”: The late Dr. Fitehett owned a
copy of his “Deeds that Won the Empire
which Monash carried through the war. The
General autographed it when lie got back
to Australia and handed it to the author.
Miss Jane Beaumont, who passed on at
Kew (Vic.), aged 89, the other day, was
reputed to be the first white girl born in
Auckland (M.L.). She landed in Melbourne
in the ’forties, her father opening the first
store in Camberwell.
The refuge of N.S.W. ex-cops is frequently
a Watchman’s job. but the rule is not general.
Superintendents Mankey and Ryan, retired
by age regulations recently, were promptly
snapped up for the house-detective staffs of
two Sydney firms—Farmers and David
Jones. Ex-Super. John Roche established a
detective agency (he.served most of his years
with the C.1.D.) ; a few bobbies have gone
into pub-keeping; ex-Inspefctor Tom Robert-
son inspects hotels for the breweries, and
another ex-policeman is a whisky traveller.
Ex-Sergeant Orr, one of the founders of
the N.S.W. Ornithological Society, breeds
and sells prize canaries and makes a good
thing out of it; and ex-Super. Goulder, the
man who got Sl'eath and Ferguson convic-
ted in the long ago, supplies Sydney flower
shops from a magnificent garden at Hornsby.
Victoria’s oldest public servant, Robert
Kenzow, of Geelong, has had his 96th birth-
day. He was the pioneer head State-school
teacher of that district, and for 88 years
had charge of the school at Grovedale.
The next branch chief to remove himself
from Clapp’s payroll will be the gruff and
aggressive Edward Henry Ballard, who lias

the Victorian railways since 1938. lie was
one of the select committee that planned the
big electrification scheme for the Melbourne!
suburban railways. His screw is £3250 a
yeal*, and lie is 65.
A Maoriland Scot, George Fowlds, was
affectionately remembered when Birthday
honors were distributed. A very successful
Auckland draper, he was born at Fenwick,
in Ayrshire, the son of a weaver who lived
to be over a hundred and who, at his cen-
tenary celebration in 3905, claimed to be
the oldest working weaver in the United
Kingdom. George, who migrated via South
Africa to Maoriland when he was 25, was
a radical in politics and a follower of Henry
George. He entered Parliament in 1899 as
member for Grey Lynn, an Auckland suburb,
and held the seat for nine years, in the last
five of which, he was Minister for Education
and Public Health under Joe Ward. A
pillar of the Congregational Church and a
great philanthropist, he was one of the
Red Cross leaders in war-time, and was re-
warded with a C.B.E. His K.B.E. comes
as a general recognition of many useful
public services.
E. T. Brennan, appointed Director of Pub-
lic Health for the Mandated Territory, took
his medical ticket at Melbourne Uni. On
Gallipoli lie collected the Military Cross,
and in France was Lieut.-Colonel in com-
mand of the First Field Ambulance.
Melbourne loses a good schoolmaster in
James Bills, now vice-principal of the Carey
Baptist Grammar School at Kew, who is
returning to his native South Aus. to take
charge of the Congregational-Baptist school
at Kensington Park, Adelaide. Born in 1882,
lie worked steadily up in S.A., and was head
of Gawler High School before crossing the
border.
The Urrbrae Research Institute, run by
Adelaide University under a Peter Waite
bequest, has appointed James Davidson, of
the Rothamstead Experimental School in
England, its expert in entomology. He is a
Doctor of Science of Liverpool, and has
given most of his 43 years to the study of
tick and such things. He gained a captain’s
stars for such work in the Sinai campaign,
and has studied his pet subject since in
laboratories all over Europe. He will settle
in Adelaide next September.
Edgeworth David, the Sydney Uni. pro-
fessor and knight, who already had some
world-interesting discoveries to his credit,
capped a brilliant scientific career when he
came upon the Mount Lofty and Flinders
Range (S.A.) fossils the other day. Briefly,
they fix the birth of life millions of years
earlier than evolutionists had supposed;
ancestors of the oldest fossil animals hitherto
known to science are in the stone, which is
of a kind commonly used in building in
Adelaide. Professor David has beerf hunting
for these specimens for 30 years. Professor
Walter Ilowchin, of Adelaide, has been lend-
ing him a hand.
Adelaide has lost a veteran carrier, H. N.
Graves, at 93. He was a carter in Port
Adelaide in 1858, and a London ’bus-driver
before that. He built up a big business in
S.A., at first in opposition to, but finally in
partnership with, John Hill, father of the
cricket family. Always a fine judge of
horses, he won the Adelaide Cup in 1907
with Spinaway.
JOHN MELROSE, the blind pastoralis!
of S. Australia, who recently gove
£ 10.000 to the Waite Institute of Agri-
cultural Research, and was knighted the
other day. IIis stud flock is known all
over Australia. He is a brother of
Alec Melrose, a liberal patron of the
arts in S. Australia.
,T. L. Watts, just dead at Thargomindah
(Q.), at 56, was one of the many Adelaide
men with pastoral interests in the northern
State. His grandfather was an early
P.M.G. in S.A. Young J.L. was associated
almost from boyhood with the Kidmans, and
from Norley station, near Thargomindah,
managed their Queensland interests. He
had some fine horses for turf and stud,
Bullawarra and Milkabah among them. He
died on his own station, Tobermory.
THE TWO TATHS.
[ FOR THE BULLETIN]
One trod a lonely path through life,
Nor looked aside.
He dared no venture and avoided strife —
And so lie died.
Another heard the blast Of war s alarms
And dared to do. ,
He lived and laughed, he knew a woman s
charms,
And he died too.
Beyond the margin of the Great Divide
They met; '
Each whispered, waiting, side by side,
“I don’t regret.”

The Primary Producers’ Bank op Aus-
tralia, Ltd., which was registered in 1923,
has a nominal capital of £4,000,000 in
700,000 £5 7 p.c. cum. prefs. and 500,000 £1
ords. Of that lot 492,589 prefs and 22 ords.
were issued at Feb. 29; thus the amount sub-
scribed was £2,462,967, an increase of £lO,lOO
during the year. The prefs., which were
issued at a premium of £l, ara called to
£l. Paid capital is £426,514; hence there was
£66,097 of call money to come in when the
books were ruled off. The premiums go to
a premium reserve, out of which formation
and preliminary exes, and some of the cost of
establishing branches, etc., have been paid.
Apparently that reserve was drawn upon
for £8640 in the last term as against £22.249
in the previous year; thus the total outlay
on establishment, etc., for the five years to
Feb. 29 was £420,579. To represent that
and the paid capital—together £847,093
—shareholders can see £517,056 belonging to
them in a steadily expanding business spread
over all the Australian States in 47 branches
and 22 agencies. Last year three branches
were closed, two new ones were opened and
two agencies raised to the dignity of
branches.
Share-selling activities have forced wide
expansion, and doubtless compelled the estab-
lishment of some outposts that have proved
a drain. However, now that the board has
closed its share-selling agencies and is cast-
ing a cold eye upon the opening of new
branches not likely to pay their way, the
end of expenditure on development should
be in sight.
The result of last year’s trading
was a‘ net profit of £5637 compared with
£5204, £3592, £3124 and £975 since the begin-
ning. No hint is given as to how those .figures
are arrived at. Adequate provision has been
made for all bad and doubtful debts, the
chairman says; but at best profits have been
a matter of rough calculation. If too little
was charged to development, ordinary bank-
ing profits were greater than the accounts
show; if it was the other way around, there
may actually have been a loss on ordinary
business. In any case, thus far divs. are
nowhere in sight.
And meantime the pref. requirements con-
tinue to pile up. Exactly liow much has
thus accumulated depends upon the dates
when capital was received. On last year’s
mean capital 7 p.c. would call for £29,412,
and on the same basis the total accumula-
tion of debt on that account at Feb. 29
would be £99,138. The amount of pref.
arrears should be clearly stated in the sheet
as a contingent liability, but it is not. What
is clear is that the board has a strenuous
task ahead to clean the slate. Meanwhile
shareholders who are depositors will have to
be content with the 2 p.c. received on their
average quarterly balances. Taking “free”
deposits as averaging only £700,000 for the
last 12 months, this would mean a payment
of £14,000, equal to p.c. on the mean paid
capital. Incidentally, only four of the Aus-
tralian banks wrote net profits of 8 p.c. or
more on their total funds (capital and re-
serves combined) at last balancing dates,
which suggests that only moderate returns
can be looked for by this institution until
something substantial in the way of reserves
has been piled up.
The bank is, however, treading a safe path
-general-manager Moffatt came to it with a
good Queensland reputation as a conservative
banker—and with the assistance of a run of
good seasons the figures show very satis-
factory expansion:—

Furniture and fittings 7,353 14,923 16,812
Since 1925 deposits have nearly doubled and
advances more than doubled. The improve-
ment last year was £226,115 in deposits and
only £149,054 in advances; thus the ratio
of the latter to deposits dropped to 86.6
p.c. compared with 89.5 p.c. in the previous
term. The necessity for keeping a substantial
part of its funds liquid and the fact that it
cannot hope to raise new capital in big slices
will limit the accommodation that the P.P.
can extend to its clients. At Feb. 29 42.8
p.c. of the liability to the public was liquid
compared with 44.4 p.c. a year earlier, and
depositors could see 19.2 p.c. of their money
in cash and at short call.
Further, for every £1 of its own funds the
bank was holding only £3 os. lOd. of the
public’s money as against £3 4s. at the close
of the 1927 accounts. That, the satisfactory
liquid position and the calls still to come in
mean that the lending connection can be
safely expanded without issuing fresh capital.
Provided the lean years remain in the back-
ground long enough, and its friends stick to
it, it now seems to be demonstrated that
good management can set this bank firmly
upon its feet.
Since the close of accounts the board has
bought Chatham House, in Pitt-street, Syd-
ney, from the Colonial Mutual Life for
£55,000.

Record sales in every State throughout the
Commonwealth sent last year’s profits up
with a rush. The board modestly wrote the
year’s net result at £37,870, or £4731 more
than in the previous term, but that was
after £24,206 had been dropped without
comment into the “insurance, tax-free,
capital and general reserves,” making the
total £196,884. Thus the spring in the
year’s visible net earnings was no less than
£12,177, the total (£62,076) reaching 33.9
p.c. on capital compared with 27.3, 23.6,
22.6 and 20.1 p.c. back to 1924. The co.’s
holdings in tax-free Government securities,
which form a substantial part of the £447,094
at which investments and cash appear in the
books, made some handsome contributions
to reserves in 1925 and 1926—£11,827 and
£11,658 respectively—but since then the
source of additions has been obscured by a
regrouping of the reserve accounts.
That the co. has nearly 2£ times its paid
capital (£182,731) invested mostly outside
the business suggests opulence, but a glance
at the liabilities brings the position into a
more correct perspective. Nevertheless, the ,
growth of investments, etc., has outpaced
that of liabilities by more than £66,000 over
the last four years. Here are balance-sheet
movements covering that period:—
1924. 1926. 1927. 1928.
Liabilities . . £250,810 £363,242 £365,240 £409,123

Investments, etc. 222,778 .357,103 364,059 447,094
The debt (£409.123), which increased
£43,883 in the last 12 months, consists
largely of “Eastern” drafts, liecessary on
account of the co.’s heavy Asiatic purchases.
Apparently the past year’s brisker trad-
ing was mostly on a cash basis; book debts
(£83,256) were £7568 lighter, stocks
(£147,987) increased only £3261 and in-
vestments, etc., grew £83,035.
Since the close of accounts, nominal capi-
tal has been increased to a round half-
million by the creation of 250,000 new £1
ords. At March 31 paid capital was
£182.731 in £1 shares—7o,ooo prefs. and
125,257 ords.; the latter called to 18s. The
ords., which are privately held, are in a
very snug position. The prefs., in which
the public is interested, carry a. fixed cumu-
lative 8 p.c. and have priority as to capital,
but no right to any further benefits. Last
year’s profit was more than 11 times their
annual requirements and the net tangible
backing was £5 Is. 3d. at March 31.
Buyers offer 235. without attracting
sellers.. The return at that figure is
approximately 7 p.c.

To provide for expansion of the business
shareholders were offered 30,000 £1 shares
at par, one for three, on June 1. When
all the money on that lot is in, paid capital
will be £120,000; and a 124 p.c. div. will
still call for £1624 less than was netted in
the last 12 months.
A couple of years ago the co. lost the
Brisbane agency for the Orient line, and at
the same time drought began to cloud the
outlpok in the pastoral industry. Faced
with an inevitable drop in earnings, the board
clipped 24 points off the div., reducing it
to 124 p.c. That rate lias been repeated
twice since, though enough was netted lasr
year to pay 18.4 p.c. compared with 16.4,
19.6, 21.6 and 21.5 p.c. back to 1924, when
wool brought its juiciest returns. Over
the last decade shareholders have averaged
134 p.c., and £43,823 of the declared net
earnings has remained in the business, mak-
ing the total lay-by £30,552 in excess of
goodwill (£50,000) at April 30.
Drought losses affected the weight of last
season’s Queensland clip, but more than 70
p.c. of the pastoral areas in the State had
a satisfactory year, and wool prices
strengthened. The average per bale was £27
Is. 4d. compared with £24 16s. 9d. for the
previous shearing, and that helped. Also
there was a steady demand for cattle at
firmer figures, due partly to Queensland
freezers having recently built up a trade in
chilled beef with southern Australian mar-
kets. One way and another the year’s gross
profits (£55,742) improved £1521, due to
better commission and like earnings. Divs.
(£4975) brought in £1660 less than in 1927.
Still they were a nice sweetener, being 114
p.c. on the book value of investments
(£41,011), which are largely represented by
holdings in a Brisbane stevedoring business.
The return in the previous year was 16 p.c.
With a fine new wool store to fill, the
management has not neglected the present
fav.orable opportunity to extend the co.’s
connections in the pastoral-finance business.
Here is the position as balance-sheet figures
show it: —
1925. ' 1926. 1927. 1928.
Liabilities. . . . £17,235 £18,166 £61,282 £81,619

Plant, etc.. . . 5,361 4;533 1,341 9,251
The £13,827 added to the overdraft (£57,672)
and the year’s surplus earnings went into
advances, etc. (£65,432). Liabilities
(£81,619) were £14,272 in excess of liquids
(£67,347), excluding shares in other cos.,
but as the new capital comes in that posi-
tion should be altered.
Most of Queensland’s sheep and cattle
men are facing the winter with confidence;
and prospects for the expansion of this
business are so encouraging that, provided
nothing extraordinary happens, the 124 p.c.
div. is not likely to be interfered with.
Buyers offer 28s. for the scrip without
attracting sellers. That figure is equal to
265. after exercising the rights, and the
return at the latter price is 94 p.c. on a
124 p.c. div. basis. The rights have been
on offer at 7s.

Recent purchases have given the Bwan
practically a monopoly of the trade in West-
ralia. A year ago it took over the Castle-
maine of Fremantle, for which £72,845 was
paid—£29,o9o cash and the balance in fully
paid ords. That made paid capital £398,815
at March 31, 1927. At. the beginning of the
last half-year 29,913 new 255. ords. were
offered at a premium of 10s. and quickly
snapped up. The premiums (£14,957)
went to reserves. About the same time the
board bought the Emu Brewery. Perth,
which is to be run under its old sign as a
separate concern. The price paid was
£39,100 in fully paid ords., equal to approxi-
mately £lOO,OOO at the market value of the
scrip when the offer was made. Thus paid
capital became £475,306 at March 31. A
year earlier the vendor’s books showed net
tangibles amounting to £113,9551, so the
apparent profit on the deal was £74,855,
but only x 58,933 was visibly added to re-
serves. On the other side the book value
of shares in other cos. (£110,354), in at
valuation, increased £101,207. Of course
the co. may have aidded to its hold-
ings other than Emu, whose scrip appears
to have been taken into the books
at £15,900 odd less than its apparent net
tangible worth at March 31, 1927.
A marked expansion of profit has followed
closely on the heels of the two deals. After
allowing for the pref. requirements (£3OOO
p.a.) tiie spring in last year’s declared net
earnings was £34,413, the total (£111,396)
mounting to 27.7 p.c. on the average
ordinary capital compared with 23, 21.7,
22.3 and 29.3 p.c. back to 1924. What
makes those attractive rates possible is the
corpulent reserves (£523,496), now £48,190
in excess of paid capital. Also the inner
strength, created by a conservative valua-
tion of the assets, is believed to be substan-
tial. Shareholders joined in the prosperity,
the div. being lifted from 16 p.c. to 20 p.c.
p.a. in the last half, and then enough re-
mained to pay another 44. p.c. A noticeable
result of the absorptions has been a pro-
portionate reduction in overhead. Exes.
(£172,031) took 60.7 p.c. of last year’s gross
profit compared with 64.1 p.c. and 66.4 p.c.
in the two preceding years.

The real liquid position is obscured by the
holdings in other cos., but there was more
than sufficient in book debts and cash alone
to meet outside liabilities, including £91,895
owing on accounts in credit and goodwills
accruing, all of which may not be of the
nature of outside debt. The increase of
nearly £50,000 in freeholds and plant is
mainly on account of the Castlemaine pur-
chase. During the year £46,013 was spent
on hotel properties and £18,639 written off.
leaving them with a net book value of
£4.80,192. There is, however, a limit to the
extent to which surplus earnings can be
profitably employed in this direction.
Meanwhile the market, which is prepared
to wait for its benefits, pays 70s. 9d. for the
ords. After allowing for the final div. and
bonus (2s. 6d.) the immediate return at that
price is approximately 64 p.c. on a 20 p.c.
div. basis, or 6 p.c. if the (id. bonus is made
an annual matter. For the very well pro-
tected prefs., which carry a fixed cumulative-
-6 p.c., buyers offer 21s. without attracting
sellers. At that price the return is 5.7 p.c.

That last result looks encouraging; but,

term was unusually heavy, thus swelling
profits. Even then the £29,158 netted was

amalgamation with other lift interests four
years later, the title swelled to Standard-
Waygood-Hereules, Ltd.; but it was changed
again in 1920, when the big English Electric
Co. was invited in and given £lOO,OOO in
fully-paids with limited rights. In 1922
these shares were surrendered for £10,000:
and since results of the association with the
English co. failed to come up to expectation,
the connection was mutually severed last
year and the co. again became Standard
Waygood, Ltd.
The div. for last year w T as lifted from 5
p.c. to 74 p.c., making an average of 5 p.c.
over the last four years, and even that called
for £B5OB more than the declared net pro-
fits. The co.’s chief trouble is the low cost
of importing electrical goods, mainly turbo-
alternators, which it manufactures. To

The Company has acquired the Prospecting Petroleum Permit issued in respect of Block
60, comprising approximately 10,000 acres on the Roma Oil Field, on which Block there
are situated the famous “Alicker” Dome, the “Flagstone” and “Bungeworgorai” Domes.
In 1923, Block 60 was selected by Dr. Jensen out of the entire Roma district as possess-
ing the most promising characteristics, and recent developments have proved the wisdom
of his selection.
Block 60 has been reported on by Dr. Jensen and Mr. Saint-Smith in very favorable terms.
Dr. Jensen, in the course of his report, states “the Roma Gas Zone will be met with at
a depth of from 1500 to 1700 feet. The geological structure being favorable, the chances
of striking oil are good”; also, “I consider the area an excellent one on which to bore
for oil.”
Mr. Saint-Smith states: “So far as I am aware, Alicker Dome constitutes the most extensive
dome structure yet recorded in the Roma Oilfield region, and certainly warrants the expen-
diture involved in testing”; also, “The establishment of the fact that at least one major
anticline and three structural domes occur on your Permit No. 60 fully justifies, in my
opinion, the formation of a company with ample funds at its disposal to bore these Middle
Walloon strata in search for oil and for petroliferous gas. Apart from the definitely favor-
able structures now known to exist on your property, mention should be made of the
following additional factors concerned in this venture: —
(a) Boring will not be hampered with having to deal with the main artesian water-
bearing beds of the Upper Walloon formations.
(b) The depth to be bored in order to reach the same geological horizon as that from
which oil and petroliferous gas is being obtained at Roma will be only 1500 feet,
as compared with 3750 feet at the latter location.
(c) Transport facilities are quite satisfactory, the area being close to Alicker Station,
on the Roma-Injune railway, and also connected by road from Roma, via Orallo.
(d) Firewood and water are abundant on the block.
In the “Sydney Morning Herald” of 13th December, 192 7, Dr. (Common-
wealth Geological Adviser), in relation to the Roma Oil Field, is reported as stating:
“The question is not now whether, but when and where, oil will be discovered.”
In view of the statements and reports made by numerous geologists and other competent
authorities who have examined the field, it is considered that the Roma Oilfield is no longer
a mere prospect, but will develop into a highly important and successful Oilfield', and the
Directors confidently claim that an investment in this Company should be exceedingly
remunerative, as the Company owns THE SELECTED BLOCK, having no less than three
promising Domes, and, according to the reports obtained, the boring will not be hampered
by the Main Artesian Water Beds, and oil should be met with at the shallow depth of
from 1500 to 1700 feet.
Dr. Jensen has been appointed Consulting Geologist to the Company, and has offered to
superintend the boring operations. A reliable firm of contractors has offered to put the
bore down to 2000 feet, at a cost of under £BOOO, and it is the intention of the Directors
to proceed with the bore at an early date.
A large number of shares have been applied for, and if the entire issue
is subscribed the application and allotment moneys of 1 /- and 1 /-, and
possibly one call of \/~ per share should provide ample funds to
enable the Company to get on to the oil strata.

further add to the difficulties of the last four
years, Australian wages have increased,
hours have been reduced, the price of supplies
of one kind and another has gone steadily up,
and costs generally have got out of hand.
The position is simply this : Australian in-
dustry can make as efficient turbo-alternators
as those now imported, but because of slow
production and high costs it cannot com-
pete, even with the present duty. The remedy
is partly in the hands of the Tariff Board
and the Government, but more in the hands
of the workmen. They can have the work
if they will increase their output.
Fortunately the co.’s finances have been
kept healthy. Here is the position as dis-
closed in the published accounts;—

The more or less liquid surplus (£118,322),
including stocks and work, improved a trifle.
Plant (£90,000), which was added to in
tin- electrical transformer branch, is in at
£5OOO less than at the previous balance,
which suggests that provision for deprecia-
tion is not being neglected. Of the co.’s sub-
sidiaries, Lift Inspection and Insurance,
Ltd., and McCulla’s, Ltd., do not publish
their figures, but the “Wild Cat” believes
they are making profits. Weymouth’s, which
has a paid capital of £52,500, paid 5 p.c.
for the last three years.
The board is offering to redeem at par the
6 p.c. debentures outstanding at any date
until Sept. 30 —an indication that business
is not brisk enough to keep the money fully
employed. The amount outstanding at March
31 was £33,400, redeemable in the ordinary
course of events in 1930. Sellers ask 13s.
for the scrip. The return at that figure is
114 p.c. on a 74 P.c. div. basis, or 7.7 p.c. if
the rate drops to 5 p.c. The backing amounts
on book values to 235. Id. in net tangibles

To meet £21,000,000 of 5 p.c. stock and
bonds due Sept. 15, the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment is asking for £20,000,000—-the other
million will be provided from the national
debt sinking fund—in either conversions or
new money at 54 p.c. The issue price is
£9B 10s., and the subscriber has the option
of a seven- or fourteen-year currency; the re-
turn. including redemption, being £5 10s. 3d.
and £5 Bs. Id. respectively. Conversions will
be sweetened with a cash bonus of £1 10s.
p.c., payable Sept. 15, the day after the issue
closes. New. money is being asked for to
pay off holders of the maturing loan who do
not convert.
The return on the new issue, which is
subject to Federal but free of State tax, is
distinctly more attractive than that on the
maturing paper, so holders have nothing to
gain by hanging back. Moreover, only from
a few of the very short-dated stocks can a
slightly better result be obtained. Also the
issue price adds to the attractiveness of the
new loan as a probate investment.

To buy, test, work and sell oil properties,
Roma Dome, Ltd., is being incubated in
Sydney with a nominal capital of £200,000
in 10s. shares, of which 300,000 are offered,
Is. on application and allotment and the
balance as required in Is. calls. In addi-
tion 30,000 fully paids and £5OO go to the
vendors, Dr. Jensen, D. C. Green, J. S.
Hanlon and L. McDonald, for petroleum
prospecting area No. 60, of 10.000 acres, 30
miles n.-w. of Roma (Q.). The area was
pegged by Jensen and Green in 1923, but
owing to Government reservation did not
become available until last year. Dr. Jen-
sen reports that three favorable boring sites
exist on this property, and is of opinion that
the Roma gas zone will be met with at from
1500 ft. to 1700 ft.; also that, oil should be
met with at 1500 ft. and in the lower horizons
- —prospects of this, he says, are good. E. C.
St. Smith, who has also inspected the pro-
perty, recommends that a bore be put down
to about 2000 ft. to test the lower Walloon
coal series for the presence of petroleum;
two other domes, he thinks, should be tested
later. He neatly sums up the position; “On
the understanding that all prospecting for oil
is considered by investors entirely in the
nature of a gamble, I can confidently recom-
mend this venture as one worthy of a thorough
prospecting campaign.” The cost of putting
the first hole down to 2000 ft. is figured at
£BOOO. On the board are Professor Barra-
elongh, A....8r0di0. Dan Carroll and A. 11.

There need be no worry or unloading i
because the Barrier Industrial Council took
the expected step of rejecting the companies’
modified offer. It will be noticed that they
made no demands when doing so, neither
did they ask for the conference, to be re-
sumed. Meantime the metal thermometer is
rising nicely, and when it stabilises at a fair
figure it is almost certain that the cos. will
suggest another meeting, with an offer of an
agreement on existing conditions. It is
almost certain that this will be accepted by
the council.

The syndicate promoted by T. R.
Buchanan and W. Brazenall in October last,
and which controls half a dozen oil pros-
pecting blocks in the Injune district, about
60 miles north of Roma, is talking about
forming itself into a co. Thus far those
interested have spent about £l5OO putting-
down three scout bores, varying from 200 ft.
to 500 ft., in each of which gas is claimed
to have been met with and the coal measures
of jurassic strata cut. A fourth hole, now-
down about 200 ft., is being sunk with the
object of checking one of the domes. When
this work is completed the main bore site
will be decided upon. Meanwhile the syn-
dicate is selling interests up to £lO,OOO.
Regarded from any point, Kangaroo Hills
(N.Q.) can only be classed as a prospec-
tors’ field, so far as lode mining is concerned.
Only one mine, the Sardine, has an output
of any note. The Sardine North, in endeavor-
ing to get a footing, has spent a lot of money
and so far has located only low-grade ore.
The last crushing of 46 tons gave only
21cwt. concentrates. On the other hand,
prospectors have fared decently, and from
a dozen or more shows where mates are
working together good ore is being won at
the moment, and quite lately there has been
increased activity. Some of them have had
crushiugs touching 10 p.c. tin, and even at
the present price of £134 per ton for 70 p.c.
concentrates in the north, they are doing-
well. Should tin return to high prices ex-
perienced lode-miners who are at a loose end
could do worse than try their luck on the
field. Prospecting parties during April last
split up close on £2OOO from their returns.
Most of the shoots arc small and are not
worth company operations. For the small
man there are fair to good pickings, with the
outside chance of discovering a Sardine. But
a man has to know the game and must be
able to stand out of any return for three
months.

Clermont (C.Q.), the field of abandoned
lodes and leads, is being chased for a lost
lead by George Croydon, and the effort
has attracted the sympathetic eye of the
Mines Department. Four shafts have been
put down and a “gully” bottomed on at
about 50ft. with colors of gold. Some
very profitable alluvial leads were worked
formerly round Clermont, and the present
venture appears to have fair prospects of
success. A bit of driving is being done at
present, and this should determine whether
the lead is likely to be payable or not.

Diggers on the Anakie sapphire field
(C.Q.) were free to sell where they pleased
on and after June 1, as the Gem Pool was
cancelled on that date. Conditions at pre-
sent are very bad, and it remains to be seen
how the new regime will work. Several
buyers were reported in sight at the end
of May. There’s a feeling, however, that
there’s not much in the future for Anakie
except for novelties.'Other competitors have
come in the market for “blues.”

In spite of the shocking price Cloncurry
gougers still produce a bit of rich ore.
From 550 tons sent to Kembla. the esti-
mated returns were 119 tons copper, 580 oz.
silver and 370 z. gold. Unfortunately there
is no attempt at systematic development. It
is just gutting.

One of the few gold-mining cos. left at
work in Victoria, outside Bendigo, is the
Eldorado, Gaffney’s Creek. It crushed
1355 tons for 6160 z., worth £2399, during
last half year—9dwt. per ton. But the
books show a balance of £716 on the wrong
side of the profit and loss account. In two
reefs the stone varies greatly, in value and
width, and a large amount of dead work
done recently has not disclosed any per-
manently rich reefs.
Westralian Chamber of Mines had its
annual roll-up the other day, when the usual
lamentations about scarcity of water, of new
mines and of good miners were interspersed
with appreciation of the State Labor Gov-
ernment’s assistance to the industry. Refer-
ence was made to the geophysical prospect-
ing which is about to be tried in the West,
and the opinion was expressed by President
Hamilton —he is getting quite a veteran now
—that it would be an extraordinary thing
if with the assistance of this scientific method
no fresli mines were discovered. Dealing
with industrial matters, Hamilton contended
that provision should be made in future arbi-
tration awards for mining apprentices. He
claimed that no skilled miner would argue
that a beginner was as skilled as he, so
why should a beginner receive similar pay
and be spoilt in the process, through not
being properly trained?

Westralian Mines Department knows noth-
ing of the agreement which a London paper
recently stated had been signed between an
Australian syndicate and a group of Jap
ironmasters for the purchase of iron ore
from the Yampi deposits in the nor’-west of
that State. It understands, however, that
Jock Thomson, co-promoter and ex-M.L.A.,
is now negotiating in Tokio for the sale
of large quantities of Yampi ore to a steel
crowd there, and if successful proposes to
work the deposits on a big scale. Thomson
is believed to have Sydney and Scottish
backing in this project..

Westralia got a surprise the other day
when it was simultaneously announced that
Claude de Bernales and some London
friends had bought the Horseshoe and that
the New Consolidated Goldfields of South
Africa, Ltd., was helping the Lake View and
Star to find £150,000 for the development of
its Chaffers lease. Lake View would like
to have got hold of the Horseshoe at its own
price, but negotiations failed, and De Ber-
nales stepped in. Had Lake View secured
the property it would have been able to
work both Horseshoe and Chaffers from the
Ivanhoe shaft—the best on the field —and
tram the ore from there to a central treat-
ment plant.
Once Golden Horseshoe was the richest
mine on Kalgoorlie. It started paying divs.
in 1899 and ceased in 1924. Up to the end
of that year shareholders had received
£3,652,000, and by the middle of 1926 gold
to the value of £12,549,931 had been pro-
duced. About that time operations ceased
owing to high working costs. The co. made
a fresh start early in 1927 and, backed by
the State Government to the extent of
£55,000, it carried on till the end of that
year. Recently a request for a further ad-
vance was refused. When the last estimate
was made ore reserves were reckoned in hun-
dreds of thousands of tons, with rich sections
in places.
Although Chaffers has got a bit of the
main Horseshoe at 2780 ft. from the sur-
face, there is a lot it hasn’t got and isn’t
likely to get until a great, depth has been
attained. De Bern ales and his friends reckon
that at 4000 ft. the Chaffers will have about
300 feet of the shoot and the Horseshoe 700
feet, while at 5000 ft. the lengths will pro-
bably be 500 ft. in Chaffers and 500 ft. in
Horseshoe. Assuming these figures are cor-
rect, Lake Views at their present price
appear to be ridiculously over-valued. But
in a market flutter that applies to the scrip
of most ventures.

North White Feather Co. (W.A.) is about
to wind up. It has been twice reconstruc-
ted and once backed by “a strong financial
group.” Now it is nearly as short of funds
as of payable ore, and the State Government
declines to help. In the circumstances the
board considers that it is hopeless to carry
on. Some time ago a local inspector of mines
reported that “very‘great possibilities were
ahead of the co.” A “Wild Cat” man who
knew the show vci’y well expressed his sor-
row that the inspector was an optimist.

Thabawleik’s recoveries for the 12 months
to Dec. 31 totalled 548.31 tons tin oxide from
810.000 c.y. dirt, an average of 1.511 b., equal
to 88 p.c. of bore values. Sales brought in
£110,022, of which exes., including £11,797
set aside for depreciation, etc., consumed
£51,022. In addition, £24,257 was written
off formation and various development
accounts, which have been thus wiped out of
the books, and £10,500 was put by for taxa-
tion, leaving a clear £24,243. Out of that
a 2s. div., paid in October, called for
£16,000; the balance (£8243) was carried
forward.
Paid capital is £160,000 in £1 shares, of
which the parent, Austral Malay ,Co„ holds
44,100. The debt to A. W. Freeman
(£14,000) was reduced £27,000 during the
year, and there was only £2OB coming to
sundry creditors at Dec. 31. At that date
the mine was in at £88,667; dredging plant,
£68,133; other fixed assets, £11,433; cash,
£18,935; odds and ends, £6226.
The price of tin averaged £2BB for the
12 months to Dec. 31; it was £225 at the
end of last week. The drop, of course,
must affect revenue and therefore profits.
In January 2s. per share was distributed,
followed by Is. in April, and the board is
hopeful of handing out another 3s. before the
close of the current year. Thus far the co.
has not put up the performances originally
expected of it. Water shortage, bamboo roots
anld adjustments to the dredge interfered
with digging for a while, but the turnover,-
which averaged 48,233 c.y. in the first half
of the term, grew to an average of 81,166
c.y. per month in the December half, when
costs (8.16 d. per yard) were cut back nearly
lid.: they are still heavy. The ground to
be dredged during the current year shows a
bore average of 1.451 b.. but results, so far.
have been disappointing. Last month the
buckets brought up 57.000 c.y., averaging
.951 b.. and costs climbed to Is. 2d. For the five
months to May 31 only 170 tons t.o. had
been won as against 292 tons for the last
five months of 1927. Stoppages for repairs
and water trouble —the latter has been re-
lieved by recent rains—were partly respon-
sible for the poorer showing.
The scrip, for which 645. was paid in
February, was recently on offer at 565. Gd.

Two parcels comprising 23 tons were lately

graders which are made by Messrs. Arthur Leplastrier
and Co. Pty., Ltd. These machines are available in
seven different sizes, either to be hauled by tractor
or horses, the prices ranging from £45 to £lO5
each. There are many properties equipped with these
machines and the results obtained amply demon-
strate the necessity of having a grader available on
the station or large farm. As most people nowadays
possess motor-cars, one of these machines will also
be able to construct and maintain in perfect condition
the private road to the homestead. Full particulars
are available from the manufacturers, Messrs. Arthur

quarie-place, Sydney. Also at Melbourne, Adelaide,

The show of the week was “The Great
Pacific Flight,” with Captain Kingsford
Smith and C. T. P. Ulm as pilot and alter-
nate pilot, and the Americans J. Warner
and 11. Lyon in the respective parts of radio
operator and navigator. It . was a tense
drama of pluck and perseverance. In the
first act Smith suffered the usual coldness
and neglect. There was even the false
accusation which is the hero’s usual fate
when lie withdrew from the Dole flight; some
little people would not see that he was after
bigger game. In the last act, however,
interest was worked into a fever by the music
of radio messages, which continued right
through the action, of the play. The final
scene was staged at the Mascot aerodrome,
where 200,000 people carpeted the ground not
specially marked off for the landing, and in
the background appeared to be millions of
ears. The babble of the vast crowd swelled
to a roar of cheers as the 'plane, which had
swept over 8299 miles of air, making all
sorts of records, swooped and came to earth.
The curtain fell with the shouting thousands
struggling for a near view of the heroes.
In an epilogue it was made known that the
leader’s heavy American indebtedness had
boon removed by the generosity of an Ameri-
can benefactor; and gifts of £5OOO from the
Federal and £2500 from the State Govern-
ment, besides public funds rapidly, increas-
ing, had come his way.
Allan Wilkie was Caliban in “The Tem-
pest” at Newtown. With John Cairns (Ste-
phano) and Arthur Keane (Trineulo) he pro-
vided a comedy relief to the beauty of the
serious speeches in the Bard’s most poetical
achievement. Alexander Marsh, who as Pro-
spero has to deal with the most important, is
a veteran in Shakspearean work; he, gave
effective authority and dignity to the char-
acter. Dennis Barry and Miss Hunter-Watts
(Ferdinand and Miranda) handled the love
passages well in spitcyof the lady’s tendency
to deep-throatednessT"and Dulcie Cherry dis-
played a likeable singing voice as a sufficiently
bright Ariel. Saturday saw a revival of

A “RIO RITA” GROUP—Gaston Mervale Gladys Moncrieff, Valentine and Iredale.
to-night (Wednesday) by “As You Like It.”
Saturday will see the staging of “Corio-
lanus.”
“Our Betters” are due to display their
manners at the Sydney Criterion Theatre on
Saturday; “Thark” will cease to satirise the
mystery play at that address on Thursday
(to-morrow) night. Leon Gordon will bury
“The Man Upstairs” in time to stage "Scan-
dal” on Saturday week at the Royal. “Prin-
cess Charming” sustains its fascinations at
Her Majesty’s, and will have a “gala night”
for the current air heroes, though "Rio Rita”
got in first in entertaining them. The Fullers
auctioned the seats for last Monday’s per-
formance, and handed the proceeds to the
funds being raised to recognise the grand
flight. Business is still "Top Hole” with the
Empire Theatre people. Arriving unexpec-
tedly with a friend at the Grand Opera
House one recent night, Steele Rudd had
the satisfaction of being told that it was
impossible to find seats for him at his own
show; “The Rudd Family” looks like equal-
ling “On Our Selection” as a money-maker.
Muriel Starr, at the Palace, is sharing the
all-round prosperity; “The Last Warning”
will probably see her season out.
Schnitzler, Evremof and A. P. Herbert are
being introduced to the Little Theatre at
Burdekin House in a season which starts
next Monday and will last a week; the
effort is to provide funds for a permanent
amateur theatre at North Sydney.
Sounds of great joy have welcomed back
Tom Katz’s Saxophone Band to the Tivoli.
At Fullers’ George Wallace has decided to
be “His Royal Highness” for this week.
Wherever his princedom is supposed to be,
it consists largely of six girls, who display
.an even more remarkable, length of leg than
the average flapper, .and’.the Ilawaiians,
Queenie and David Kaili, are liege subjects.
The Regent management sees no reason yet
for superseding “Wings.” A satire on news-
paper “stunting” underlies the uproarious
comedy, “The Big Noise,” which the Lyceum
is showing; it deals with spurious sensations
made by the American press. A powerful
series of scenes in “Old San Francisco”
shows the destructioh of the city by earth-
quake and fire, the City history, which is the
background for a conventionally melo-
dramatic story, making this picture at the
Capitol worth while.
.* * * *
The philanthropic Taits continue to pro-
duce new stars with the nonchalance of a
Salvation Army captain handing out soup-
tickets. They got a fresh opportunity with
“C. Rusticana” and “1 Fagliacei” last week.
Set to the sort of music provided by a law
court, the famous double bill would be a
whole-page story for the Daily Muckrake,
with photos of the accused and the victims
when they were babies. As staged by the
Williamson-Melbas the twin dramas were a
triumph of good singing and amazingly
realistic acting, with John Brownlee con-
tributing to one department his rich assured
baritone and to the other an entirely new
version of Tonio, of the twisted soul and
body; and with Francesco Merli, as Pagli-
acci, scaling new heights of vocalism and
raging agitation. Of the new arrivals, Elena
Danieli smote the eye hard and the ear a
trifle less violently. She brightened “Pagli-
acci” with a vivid and winsome Nedda, and
her voice, which Melba is said to have dis-
covered glorifying a Parisian attic, has
obvious possibilities. Marion Frank, as
Lola, left a pleasing first impression, and
Xenia Belmas was a dark, muscular San-
tuzza. Calabrian and Sicilian villages are
entirely populated by efficient vocalists,
according to the
chorus. The show
was one of the
handsomest pre-
sents the manage-
ment has yet made
to Melbourne.
“T uraudo t,”
offeredto a thronged
Melbourne
Majesty’s on Satur-
day, opens on the
violet battlements
of Peking. Because
a female ancestor
was badly treated
by an invader, the
princess Turandot
asks all suitors
three riddles, failure
to answer which
entails decapitation.
As the curtain rises
executioners drag
the Prince of Persia,
to the block. His
head has no sooner
music of a sarcasti-
cally funereal sort,
than the Unknown
Prince appears and
announces his de-
termination to try.
his luck. lie solves
the riddles in a
scene of genuine
dramatic power
and to music of
mingled Oriental
and Italian inspira-
tion. Turandot dis-
plays frank distaste
for his nupt i a 1
Couch, so he gives
her a chance: —if
she guesses his
name by daylight
he will keep the
executioner in work.
Peking, ordered to
hit the dust, to
devote itself to the task—-a . general
massacre of the population being the
reward of non-success—sets about the job
with vigor. Liu, the Prince’s attendant, is
tortured and, to save her master, suicides.
This stirs tenderness in Turandot’s heart,
and when the prince divulges his name and
plants a fervid kiss upon the lady’s lips, her
repressed, instincts awake. (At about this
point death snatched Puccini’s pen and
Franco Alfano completed the score —very
well on the whole, though there was not
much to do but restate and round off the
master’s themes.) The last scene is a musi-
cally perfunctory affair of orange blossoms
and confetti, or their Peking equivalent. The
play ends on a cheerful note.
* $ * *
A rich mixture of fantasy and childish
savagery, of Chu Chin Chow. versions .of
Mongolian themes with typical Italian
melody, of genuine feling, fine imagination
and empty bombast, is this last offspring of
Puccini’s ‘ muse. It was staged with the
utmost Oriental magnificence at the Taits’
command. There are 45,000 characters in
the Chinese language, but the scene-painters
elected to add a few of their own to decorate
the palaces and temples—otherwise the local
color was all that could be wished. Arangi
Lombardi led the part of Turandot through
haughty frigidity to abandoned passion with
her usual skill and her splendid supply of
voice. Francesco Merli’s Prince was strik-
ingly dramatic and faultlessly tenored, Zam-
belli as his father took a kingly baritone
into exile, but Luisa Bonetti, as the girl
who suicided, was troubled by vibrato as
well as by the misery of her fate. Ghirardini,
Parodi and Luigi Cilia, as Ping, Pang and
Pong, Gilbertian court dignitaries, added
grim humor to the dish. Last named is the
most intelligent'actor in the co.
An easily predicted change at Mclb.
Comedy will be “Rookery Nook” in place of
“Diplomacy” on Saturday. The English
comedy presents a recent youthful discovery
in 15-year-old Donalda Warne, on whom the
Firm has announced its readiness to put" its
shirt. The Fuller management announces.
“Good News” for the Princess oh the same
night.
F.A.Q. grand opera ceased from troubling
the critics at Melb. Princess yesterday
(12th), and the property dagger is enjoying
a well-earned rest. “Ernani” was the chief
feature of the season’s close. This earlv
specimen of Verdi is Italian opera at its
loud, strident and gory worst, though there
is a rough strength about the music and the
action is swift. Tamburini was the exiled
Castilian Duke. He is a deplorably conven-
tional barnstormer; but the sixteenth century
is hard on a gr’opera hero —he can’t put lus
hands in his pockets or toy with a cigarette.
Izal and Fumagalli were more to present
MAIDIE HOPE, who plays the Duchess in “Our Betters ,” which
opens at the Sydney Criterion on Saturday.
commentator's taste; and Miss Silvestri, as
Elvira, was good in voice and looks.
After a brief run, the Storyettes revue com-
pany vanished from Melbourne Bijou on
Friday, and Erie Masters’s merry-whirl revue
company rushed into the void. The differ-
ence is mainly one of names.

Dorothy Revier is the Romany lass in
several thousand feet of gypsy love and hate
at Melbourne -Majestic this week. “The
Tigress” is the title of the tale, and a charm-
ing savagery adorns its telling. Hoyt's
management pins its current supply of faith
to “The Patent-leather Kid.” Richard
Bartlielmess is the professional pugilist whose
facial beauty -is miraculously preserved in
order that Molly O’Day may marry a hand-
some hero in the end.
At the risk of making itself unpopular,
The Bulletin is constrained to murmur
that “Anna Christie,” Eugene O’Neill’s, sar-
donic comedy of the sea at Melbourne King's,
is the only piece of sincere, and compelling
drama offering in town. O’Neill’s theme,
unlike those of other contemporary purveyors
to the stage, will not grow stale so long
as unchaste Man demands perfect chastity
of Woman. Rare poetry and insight touch
with beauty those pothouse types usually de-
scribed as sordid. Gregan McMahon’s ren-
dering is adequate; Scott Alexander and
Norman Wister are excellently in place, and
Daphne Deane, as Anna, makes amends for
being conspicuously unimpressive in the
quieter moments of the. piece by rising to
the occasion when the occasion demands
aerial flights.
“Please Get Married” is the latest pre-
scription for tired minds being provided by
the popular Dr. Frank Neil from his well-
known consulting-rooms, the Palace Theatre,
Melbourne: “Please, etc.,” in which Neil
takes off his trohsers, should have a long
run. Field Fisher and Lily Molloy keep
the audience in a continuous jelly of helpless
laughter. The farce has been set occasion-
ally to music by a clever young Melburnian.
Jack o’llagan. Composer O’Hagan’s music
is quite as good as any written for the
hurdy-gurdy -market, and a good deal more
tuneful than much of the imported.
* * * *
The Prince of Wales has taken the lead
in Adelaide’s spoken drama with a sound
rendering of the thriller “Spooks,” all char-
acters entering through the audience and the
stage’s intangible fourth wall. The acting
is well balanced, the greatly popular Darcy
Kelway having a stronger part than usual.
The Royal has contentedly settled down to
a Variety programme for a bit.

ABORIGINAUTIES

BARNES LINSEED OIL
“The Rumpus”: The noddy that went
shopping in Brunswick (B. 2/o/‘2S) re-
minds me of a moke my dad owned in
Bananaland. We ran a little bush pub and
our handy horse’s name was Tiger. The
flat in front was his favorite pasture, and
when wanted, called up by the rattle of a
few grains of corn in a dipper, he came along
at a joyous gallop right up to the pub
door, and inside it, too, unless stopped.
One autumn lie ate poison weed and when
on his last legs wandered into the bar. Dad
gently took him out, and after a while lie
was missing. Later we found him dead in
what we called the “coffee-room,” a big
cement-floored drunks’ dead-house. The
poor old prad had died as nearly like a
gentleman as possible.
HE WASN’T VERY IMPORTANT.
J.P.: “Look here, Jimmy, you’re the defendant — understand?”
JINMY : “No plurry fear, Boss. That lawyer feller he defendan’ alonga me. Mine'
only poor blackfeller stolem sheep.”
“Mulgo”: Many men on the track never
get used to sleeping without a buffer of some
sort for the hip-bone, the most prominent
and awkward part of one’s anatomy when
dossing on hard ground. Some wear a
specially-made hipper, consisting of marsn-
pial fur or a stuffed strip of bagging, which
is their only bed, excepting blankets. A
few carry small pads, stuffed with horse-
hair, wool or feathers; others, mostly bony
individuals, make a small hollow in the
ground to accommodate the protuberance;
but the majority of travellers are content to
gather a few leaves or an armful of grass.
The remains of these beds are seen along-
side many a track. One man I knew
strapped a wide piece of long-wooled sheep-
skin round his hips, like a short petticoat.
\ comical figure lie looked as he lit his pipe
at the fire before tuning in. But he could
doss with it on a rock. “Just as good as
the best mattress,” lie said.
“Toonooba” : The Wapioburra abos. of the
Keppel Islands (C.Q.) were good in the water.
North Iveppel island lies pine miles off-shore ;
the south island is a couple of miles further
off but there are intervening isles. In the
late 'sixties three South Keppel abos. were
kidnapped for a joke and set free on the
mainland at Yeppoon. They took to the
water and all reached the island, but old
Lour, as he approached the isle, had the
calf torn from his leg by a shark. Later
the island was a reservation for the rem-
nants of various local tribes who eventually
were transferred to a southern reserve.
Whilst being transported two escaped on
the mainland at Emu Park and safely re-
gained the island. But the Wapioburra
folk respected the shark and preferred
canoeing to swimming.
* $ * *
“E.S.” : A horse that wants to go back to
its native run is generally a nuisance; but
I have known times when the boomerang
moke was good property. There was young
Bill Greenstick, for instance, a lone selector,
who wanted to cultivate the acquaintance of
a farmer’s daughter who lived away back of
all beaten tracks. He found the old man was
jin unsociable sort, who didn’t like young
men coming after Sarah. So Bill resorted to
strategy. He bought an old horse from
Sarah’s dad, and when he wanted to see her
he left the sliprails down, and the moke,
which was always hanging about there, went
home. Then, of course, Bill went after it.
and incidentally had a chat with the girl.
Eventually they got married, and thereafter
the moke ceased to stray. “That will tell
you about the affection of animals,” said
Dad. “How fond that horse must have been
of Sarah!”
“G.8.L.”: The Narrinyeri tribe, which
inhabited the Lake Alexandrina district of
S. Aus., and the Arunta tribe of Centralia
both had world-deluge traditions (B.
IG/5/’2B). The Narrinyeri legend is that
long ago a great chief called Nurundere
pursued two runaway wives and caught
them near Encounter Bay. Being omnipo-
tent and very angry he caused a great flood
to sweep over the country and drown his
wives, saving himself by reaching high land
in his canoe. He lives on in the spirit, and
the thunder is his voice when raised in anger.
The Arunta people believe that the whole
continent was once covered with salt water,
which gradually receded away to the north
owing to the influence of some northern
tribes who wanted it for themselves. Groups

CANDOR.
“Ded you tell William John I was a rotter ?”
“Iss, I ded. An’ 1 said more’n that. I told un you wadden none the best o’ they.”
formation out of rats, purrakeets, lizards,
trees and so on were then living beside the
shores of the great salt water. Two beings
came down to the earth from the western
sky, and with great stone knives formed
the unshaped people into proper human pro-
portions. The people who had developed
from lizards wandered away in one direc-
tion, the kangaroo people in another, and so
on with all the totemic groups. As they
went they made all the creeks, hills and
waterholes now in existence.
“Tariff”: When the Broken Hill Prop,
was getting its limestone flux from Wardang
Island, Spencer Gulf, urgent communica-
tion was carried on with the mainland by
means of carrier-pigeons. Some of the birds
were left there and they have multiplied
amazingly; the limestone caves are now
swarming with them. A pair of Adelaide
lads recently sailed over to the island and
caught as many as they could bring back.

“Carisbrook. Jun.”: Tell “Up Top” (B,
20/4/'2S) I didn’t insinuate that the abo.
is satisfied with one wife only. What I
said was that most abos. have only one wife.
Tribal laws, especially those of Centralia
and Westralian abos., demand strict adher-
ence to the moral code. But Binglii is not
a moral Rock of Gibraltar, and it sometimes
occurs that Tommy’s lubra goes bush with
Harry. In such a case Tommy, unless he
has someone else in view, solicits the aid
of the rest of the tribe, and if Harry and
the erring wife are caught, summary ven-
geance is meted out to the pair. The lubra
is belted back to the camp, and her seducer,
if he survives the spear-fight, is ostracised
from the tribe, spending an Islimaelitish
existence until some other tribe takes him to
its bosom.

“C. Coral” : On Yam Island, Torres Strait,
there are the remains of some old shrines,
belonging to the mysterious cult of Sigai
and Maiau, hero-people who, with others,
came in their canoes in the dim past and
settled on the Strait islands. The shrines
have been deserted for the l<?st half-century;
but some few years back, when a trading
vessel happened to call in, some Papuan boys
went to the shrine of Sigai and a man,
picking up one of the age-worn boo-shells
lying on the ground, blew a sonorous blast.
His hosts were alarmed, for interference with
the shrine portended trouble. The boy
took the shell on to the schooner, however,
and made the hills of Yam re-echo. That
night the wind shifted suddenly, rose in
force and dashed the schooner on to the
reefs, where she became a total wreck. “Ah !”
said the people, “that is what comes of dis-
turbiug sacred things!” Since then the
sacred boo-shell has remained silent. If
a Yam islander wants to injure an enemy he
takes a handful of soil from the shrine and
throws it into the bows of the adversary’s
canoe or dinghy when no one is about.
He believes that the next time his enemy
puts to sea the craft will split from ‘stem to
stern.
“J.W.T.”: Either Whitsunday Passage
(B. 23/5/’28) has improved vastly as a
fishing ground, or the local fish are particu-
larly hardy. As part of the training of
middies from Jervis Bay and boys from the
Tingira, the captain of the Sydney decided
to drop a depth charge while passing
through that passage in October, 1920. The
explosion was a success, but the cooks had
little extra work, for the catch was two
flathead about six inches long. So you can
count me out of the proposed fishing excur-
sion to Whitsunday Passage.
“Kune”: An old boar lately bagged in the
bush near Wanganui (M.U.) weighed a
quarter of a ton. Heavy revolver bullets
fired at his head were no more effective than
butter-pellets ; it took a dozen body shots to
make him pork. Measured tip to tip, from
snout to tail, he was 9ft. —an ugly fellow to
stumble across in the dark!

THE WANDERERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN]
Wide scattered and in disarray,
With every wind that blows,
By sulky, boot and rattling dray
The floating legion goes ;
In tilted carts that rock and jar,
In waggonettes and trucks;
By bike, and in a motor-car,
A traveller de luxe.
And whether west or north they trek,
Some in tire saddle ride,
A bag beneath the horse’s neck,
A quart-pot at the side.
Awhile they halt at shed and yard.
On field and cattle camp;
Then onward by fair ways and hard,
Again they ride or tramp.
Each with his quest and each liis load,
They're met from strand to strand,
For eveyy road’s a gipsy road
That veins the hinterland.
Beside the never-ending ways,
Along a thousand streams,
Through winter nights and rainy days
The friendly camp-fire gleams.

“Bill Bowyang”: “Worst place I ever
struck for skeeters was a patch of low-lying
ground near Cape Upstart,” said Jim, the
fisherman, as we sat on a N.Q. beach and
watched the tide covering the long-winged
traps. “A couple of years back a bloke
arrived there from one of the cities, and he
reckoned the change of climate would benefit
his weak lungs. I told him the skeeters were
terrible bad, but he just laughed and built
a nice little two-roomed humpy close to the
beach. When he finished it off with a coat
of white paint it looked pretty decent, and
made my bark hut. which was close by,
look like a blackfellow’s mia-mia. The
morning after he painted it he was surprised
to see it was a slate grey color. When he
had a closer look, blow me if he didn’t find
that millions an’ millions of skeeters were
stuck on the wet paint. We had to scrape
the whole house with pieces of tin, paint it
over again, and keep a green wood fire burn-
ing round it day and night until it was
dry.”

“Boronia”: “No more strangers fer me !”
snorted old Cockychaff Dick. “I’ve jist bin
look down fer 20 quid. Two blokes come
lookin’ fer work, an’ I give ’em a job ring-
barkin’ one uv me back paddicks—two
’undred acres at two bob ’n acre. They
seemed decent blokes, so I never both-
ered to take a screw at wot they wuz
doin’. Lars’ night they come to me after tea
an’ says they wuz finished. One uv ’em
says ’e’s got noos that ’e’s ole man’s crook,
and would I walk out, right then ’n’ pass the
work so’s they could ketch the midnight
train. I felt sorry fer this cove, ’e looked
so mis’rable, an’ it bein’ bright moonlight
l went to the paddick. Walkin’ around a bit
I could see they’d chopped a good wide
ring, so we goes back, ’n’ I writes ’em out
their cheque. Gripes, I bin took down < a
treat! I jist bin out to that paddick, ’n’
th’ only trees that bin rung is a few jist
round w’ere we went. They’d simply put
a ring of whitewash round the others!”

SNIFTER “What would yer do, Snodger, if some bloke left yer a million pounds?”
SNODGER: “Nothin’.”
“G.F.” : The Ma State very early made a
reputation as a good grazing country. In
1788 two bulls, with four cows, owing to the
neglect of the man in charge of them at
Farm Cove, Sydney, wandered into the
woods and were lost. Seven years later
Governor Hunter found the herd, now 60 in
number, south of the Nepean River. Gover-
nor Phillip made a present of the progeny
of two of the cows, his private property,
to his successor, Governor King, who, writ-
ing to Lord Hobart in 1804, reported that
the herd had increased to 5000 head, and
asked to be allowed to take 300 head from
the Government’s tame herds as the equi-
valent of his share, which request was
granted.

“Bill R.”: I agree with “Mei” (B.
23/5/’2B) that sense of smell does not always
account for a dog’s knowledge of his master’s
impending return. I once owned a Gordon
setter slut that would invariably meet me at
a bend in the road half a mile from home.
No matter at what hour of the day or night
I returned, she would be there on watch.
She had to pass through the town to reach
our meeting-place, and she never came
further than the one point.
* * * *
“Sucker”: “Black Tracker” asserts (B.
28/3/’2B) that wedge-tailed eagles don’t in-
dulge in carrion. Wliat rot! They might
prefer red-blooded food when it’s available,
but if they’re feeling disinclined for work,
and if the other is easily available, they’ll
take carrion every time. The great differ-
ence between a dingo and an eagle as de-
stroyers of sheep is that the dog might kill
for sport, but the bird only kills for food.
It will return to a carcase every day so long
as it can get a feed from it, and even when
that carcase is putrid the eagle will hunt
the crows and take his cut. That’s what
makes the eagle so easy to poison—he’ll
always return to his kill.

“X2X”: Goanna oil does penetrate glass.
I’ve seen it tested. About half an ounce
was placed in a test-tube three-quarters of
an inch in diameter, and the tube was her-
metically sealed by melting it in a Bunsen
flame. The outside of the glass was care-
fully washed with spirit in order to remove
any oil which might have adhered after fill-
ing. The tube was then placed in a paper-
lined cigar-box and put away for two weeks.
When the box was opened it was discovered
that the paper in it was thickly smeared with
the oil, although there was no appreciable
diminution of the contents of the tube.
“B-Gar” : Kelly, the boundary-rider, once
liked to welcome visitors to his hut, but he
suddenly developed a distaste for company
so pronounced that the manager of the
station decided to give him a call. After
listening to the manager, Kelly said, “Come
over here, an’ I’ll show yer why I don’t want
no one about the hut.” Taking the boss to
a yard in the scrub, Kelly proudly pointed
to an emu and a camel. “That’s the reason,
boss,” said Kelly. “I’m breakin’ that pair
in ter beat Ryan over at the Gap show fer
the best turnout. He’s drivin’ a cow an’ a
calf in a sulky. I’m goin’ ter drive the emu
and the camel tandem.”
“Gregor”: “Coo-ee” isn’t the monopoly
of the Australian abo. In a description of
an Indian tribe inhabiting the Aran-
eanian country, South America, Edgar
Young, a traveller in those latitudes, writes:
“They complete the circle, drawing it closer
and uttering their shrill cry, ‘Koo-ee,
koo-ee.’ ” Again, in a work published in
1823 by one Porforio Drusillo, I found a
passage in which he describes the cry of the
Indian stock-herders on the plains south of
the Andes as “Koo-ay, koo-ay,” and says it.
starts low and rises to a high note, exactly
as does our own “coo-ee”: the herders, it
seems, used it not only when driving stock
but also for calling to each other. In sailing
davs, many of the ships which came to this
country made the voyage by way of South
America. Is it not possible that the abos.
first learned their “coo-ee” from white men?
PENETRATION.
“By Jove, Combo, I see you’ve got some nasty holes in your boots.”
“Yes, Boss. And worst of ’em is they just as bad inside where you can’t see ’em.”
“M.L.F.”: “Lex’s” lilting verses (B.
25/4/’2B) using “miril tiril tiri” and “min-
ning minning,” native names for our blue
wren and his mate, set an example worthy
of being followed by other Australian poets.
Here are a few more native words that
might be worked in—l am indebted for
them to an old gin in the Katanning (W.A.)
district: Dusky wood-swallow, barbeej
golden-breasted whistler, bowlie; red-tipped
diamond-bird, we-due-we-due; black-faced
cuckoo-shrike, dillyower; white-bellied sea-
eagle, goolara; striped brown hawk, carra-
callu; slate-breasted rail, kullee. There are
many other instances in which the native
names score.
“Pick”: The only real difficulty in cir-
cumventing termites (B. 16/5/’2B) is to
find their tracks leading to earth. These
always exist, and when discovered the in-
sects may easily be exterminated because
they eat their own dead. A poison prepara-
tion in powder form is obtainable from almost
any storekeeper. A few teaspoonfuls of
this powder poured along the tracks will
destroy a whole colony of ants.
* * * *
“Gouger”: Northern divers eat a very
light breakfast, for diving in deep water on
a full stomach is liable to bring on paralysis.
The water is heaviest when there is no
tide; at such times walking down below is
like pushing through the wall of a
house. When the tide is flowing
the movement of the water helps,
but the diver must work with the
water. Whatever the depth, the
tide exerts the same force down
below as on the surface. Should
the diver over-balance and fall
when the tide is strong, the pres-
sure of the rushing water is suf-
ficient to keep him pinned to the
bottom. Many tide-race waters
cannot be worked at all, a notable
instance being Albany Pass, oppo-
site Somerset, where the water is
a mill-race with each turn of the
tide. The place is known to be
rich in shell, but in addition to
the terrific tides its bottom is full of great
holes. The “divers’ graveyard” off Darnley
was populated mostly on account of the great
depth of the holes, helped by a forest of
sea-trees.
H: * * *
“Lao-dah”: Can seals tell? Last year
workmen on the railway pier at Geelong
adopted one, feeding him whenever he
appeared. This year there are dozens, and
fishermen are talking of getting depart-
mental permission to destroy them.
=l-. * * *
“Pick”: Though the salt-water eatfisu
wears a smile on his broad, whiskered coun-
tenance, he is a member of the sea razor-
gang. When surrounded by a net he seeks
an outlet along the meshes, and will attack
the line-haulers with speed and ferocity.
When pulled ashore lie must 'be f wide

lies flat backward from the

points, sharp
poison. Hard and buttle, they will IneaL
off n* the wound they inflict, and are then
dangerous. Even when withdrawn from the
flesh they leave an unclosing puncture that
admits the air and is excruciatingly painful.
The man prodded by a catfish is lucky if he
appears on duty again inside of six weeks.
“Trevdee”: Why do old-time pictures of
pure-bred cattle depict the beasts as being
absolutely square-cut? Have the animals
altered in type or were the artists at fault?
In a Melbourne stock-agent’s office the walls
are adorned with paintings of pure-bred
shorthorns. Colorings and back-grounds arc
all right, but the beasts themselves are shaped
like blocks of wood draw with a set-square,
and the tiny legs and head look as if they
had been stuck on afterwards.
* $ * :!=
“F.S.G.”: The English blackbird, be-
loved of poets for his tuneful warble and
glossy plumage, looks like being added to
our imported pests. A few years ago some
sentimental idiot liberated a pair in the
Speck and now it is being borne in on
fruitgrowers that the starling is not in the
same class as the blackbird as a fruit
stealer. The Government has offered five
shillings per head for the outlaws, in the
hope of exterminating them.
“The Rumpus”: Lately a huge tribe of
black ants residing within the lining of my
jarrah kitchen walls put up an unexpected
performance. My wife scalded about 1000
of the pests just near sundown and left them
lying on the floor. The kitchen was not
used until luncli-time the following day, when
it was discovered that the living ants had
carted their dead up on to the table and left
them in little heaps. Was it just tidiness
or an act of reproach?
*'*
“Coot”: Binglii’s legend of the origin of
the Peliades is quite a romantic affair. They
were seven beautiful maidens, the Meamei
sisters. But their bodies sparkled with
icicles. One day a native named Wurrimah
abducted two and forced them to be his
wives. The other five took refuge in the sky.
Wurrimah endeavored to rid his wives of
their icicles by standing them before a firu,
but only succeeded in dulling their bright-
ness, and the little ice that did melt put the
fire out. The two girls were miserable, and,
escaping, joined their sisters in the sky. The
two that were dulled do not shine as
brightly as their sisters.
❖ * * *
“Neurone”: The theory that a kangaroo
will not fight unless attacked received a
knock when an old man took on a scrap with
the rail-motor which runs between Adelaide
and Paringa. Ilis first onslaught bent the
running-board and mudguards, and broke
both headlights. The belligerent chap then
made a charge which landed him under the
wheels, frona which he emerged minus a
front- and hind-leg. Even then he fought
on till mercifully despatched by the motor-
man.
PHANTASY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Shuffling up the dusty road.
Trudging home behind the sheep,
Comes a little lad each night,
Whistling, as I fall asleep.
Constant little pilgrim he,
Making sturdy melody.
Scent of dust, and dogs, and sheep!
Night has set my fancy free.
Through the dust across the years
Comes a little ghost of me,
Shrilling all the songs I knew,
Whistling as I used to do!
Other folk may count their flocks
Jumping over weary stiles;
Sleep and I go softly up
Where the old road home beguiles,
Dawdling where the dust lies thick,
Slicing at an aloe stick!
Past the creek, and up the rise.
Far behind, upon a sea
Burnished as my mother’s brass,
Sprawls a red sun, lazily.
Lolling lordly where the rim
Of a new world waits for him.
Shadow-purple hills ahead
Beckon, and beyond the bend
Burn the pomegranate’s lamps
Signalling the journey’s end.
Underneath that gnarled old tree
Mother always waits for me!
Trudging up the old road home,
Bringing in the few brown sheep,
When I reach my mother’s side
Instantly I’m fast asleep!
For sweet sake of Memory,
Let an old chap’s folly be!

PASTURAGE VALUES.
“Te Hipi”: “Hatter’s” pasturage theory
(B. 2/5/’28) is not so new. Some years ago
experiments in the U.S.A. showed that
closely cropped grass contained more nutri-
ment than rank growth. The Yanks kept
pastures mowed to different heights and
mowed others at varying periods; they had
fields varying from closely shaved lawn-like
ones to the rankest obtainable. Sheep were
found to relish the very shortest growth pos-
sible, but cattle required a slightly longer
growth. The different methods of feeding
account for this. The grass which was kept
mowed to the required height for the respec-
tive animals showed the best returns. For in-
stance, a field that was closely shaved and
then allowed to grow to the required length
for cattle was not the equal of one that
was frequently mowed to the same height.
Apropos “Titun’s” plea for manuring pas-
tures (B. 2/5/’28), the late war between
the big manure firms in Maoriland put
thousands of pounds in the farmers’ pockets.
The cheap fertilisers were taken advan-
tage of, and in the district which I
know best, the Rangitikei .Valley, more than*
halt' of the pastures, most of which have
been down from 30 to 50 years, have been
liberally top-dressed. Strangely enough, the
hilly country (some of it stands nearly
on end) shows the greatest improvement,
1 suppose the reason for this is that the
flats—alluvial, of course—are generally a
better class of land than the hills, and im-
provement in them would not be so notice-
able. But this should be discounted by the
much heavier stocking of the flats. Any-
way, even where the hills are of much the
same quality as the flats, they show to a
much greater advantage after being top-
dressed.
LUCERNE IN DRY AREAS.
“Pomme”: The real dry lucerne country
of S. Australia lies from Booboorowie 100
miles north of Adelaide towards Canowie,
the rainfall being 18 inches. But the lucerne
undoubtedly depends on underground water
supplies, growing always on the bottom
of the valleys between high hills. The
proved lucerne land in this locality is worth
£70 an acre and is all falling into station-
owners’ hands. The adjoining wheat land,
perhaps only a few chains away, is worth
£12 to £14.
That lucerne will grow to some extent on
dry ground is shown by a half-acre I have
planted near the Murrumbidgee Irrigation
Area, 17in. rainfall. On deep, light soil
with rubbly limestone it survives the dry-
est weather, but is only of use as fodder
after rain or in a summer like the past,
which has been very wet. In every spring-
time it is useful and after every rain; but
let no man think he is going to grow lucerne
like the Booboorowie areas do on such a light
rainfall without the underground water-
supply.
ARE WINKERS ANY GOOD?
“K.B.”: “Paul C.” (B. 23/5/’28) is too
sweeping in his condemnation of winkers.
They are very serviceable when a horse is
lazy, or when one is too “free.” Every
horse I educate to harness is first driven
in winkers and afterwards with an open
bridle to make him usable either way.
Let “Paul C.” attempt to drive a very
“free” horse with a sluggish one in a buggy,
and he will (or should) soon discover that
winkers are not useless. Without winkers,
“touching up” the sluggard would excite
the fiery horse, and result in it pulling
nearly all the load instead of, say, 60 per
cent, of it. Even in a sulky I have known
horses that would, if driven with an open
bridle, develop the bad habit of springing
forward when the driver moved in any way
which might lead the horse to see (or
imagine) that the whip was coming. With
winkers such a horse will go more evenly
and do his bit without half the trouble.
A man who attempted to educate an un-
broken horse to harness without winkers
would be badly handicapped if he were
to enter competitions in horse-handling sucli
as I advocated in The Bulletin years ago.
The shearing contests which I urged have
since proved most popular and useful. Per-
haps the R.A.P. Society may yet see that
it is foolish to spend thousands to encou-
rage the better breeding of horses while not
a brass farthing is given to ensure the bettor
handling of them when bred. If such com-
petitions were held the value or otherwise
of winkers and many other things would be
illustrated by practical test, which is the
only way of getting at the truth. Asa
competitor (which I would certainly be) I
would feel a sure winner if I knew all the
others thought as “Paul C.” docs.
STACK ENSILAGE;
“Firestick” : “A.Z.A.C.” (B. 16/5/’2S) is
in error when he states that tin* building
of stack silos with side supports had its
genesis on the N.S.W. North Coast. The
system was evolved by 11. C. Quodling,
(Queensland Director of Agriculture, apd was
introduced into N. S. Wales at demonstra-
tions made by that State’s field officer at
Dorrigo and Woodburn in 1918. *
For best results the crops should be
harvested at the time of their- maximum
vegetative growth.; and, 1 although some lati-
can be allowed, difficulties are more
likely to arise with over-matured than with
immature crops, the' former necessitating
greater rapidity in stacking so as to ex-
clude air and thereby avoid excessive tem-
peratures.
THE TIME TO CUT HAY.
"Sclerote”: What “Hatter” and “T.W.”
say of protein in hay amounts to the same
thing iii practice, as they agree to cut the
hay-crop immature. “T.W. ; ” however,
wants to cut the crop just prior to flower-
ing; but as the plants are still manufac-
turing proteins at this stage, and Continue
to do so while the leaves arc green, this
will lead to loss.
Although the percentage of protein is
greatest in very young hay, the total yield
is greatest at maturity. But .at this
stage the proteins are not so digestible, and
what is wanted is the highest yield of
digestible protein per acre. This is probably
obtained at the end of the flowering period,
when the fruit is commencing to form, and
crops for hay ought to be cu t as close to
this stage as convenient. Wheat is cut when
the grain is in the milk stage. Oats are less
bitter at a later stage, and are cut when
the grain is doughy. Lucerne receives
special treatment. It is perennial, and the
plants must be kept vigorous and saved the
exhaustion of even partial seeding. The
crop should be cut therefore at the com-
mencement of flowering.
Proteins, then, are not . the only factor
that should decide the time of cutting;
bulk, ease of curing for hay and general
management of the farm are all to be taken
into account.
WHEAT OR WOOL?
“C.Iv.C.”: “D.J.” advises the wheat-
grower (B. 36/5/’28) to buy sheep. He
takes for a basis 500 acres of “good, red
soil” likely to yield in an average season six
bags of wheat from a 300-acre sowing, or
carry a sheep to the acre. His theory is
that the sheep give a higher return per acre
than wheat. On the figures submitted, both
wool and wheat are poor propositions. No-
where in this State (Vic.) or in the near-in
Riverina can one purchase good wheat coun-
try, every acre ready for the plough, for less
than £10: which means that “D.J.” is utilis-
ing £5000 worth of land, from which his
sheep will return an annual profit of £4O0 —
if he is lucky.
There is only one way to successfully farm
good land in these days of inflated land
values—sell it and invest the cash in first
mortgages. Sell the sheep, 500 at £l, and
dispose of the proceeds in the same way.
Finally get a job at £4 a week. Result:
interest from £5500 at 7 per cent. = £3SS;
wages, £2OO ; total, £SSS. This, derived from
48 hours’ labor weekly, without the worry
of seasons, markets, rabbits, dogs, flies,
grass seed, etc., compares more than favor-
ably with “D.J.’s” £4OO.
PODDYING.
“The Welkin”: I wouldn’t allow the calf
to run with the mother for a few days, as
“Lex” suggests (B. 9/5/’2B). If the calf
is horn over-night, take it away in the
morning for artificial feeding. If you leave
the little beggars they accustom themselves
to lifting up their heads to suck, and a man
has the work of the world to force their
heads into a bucket or trough. Bull calves
especially are stubborn, and they start
hunger-striking.
With poddying it is the early work that
counts. First, have them good. No man
ever made money with scrubbers. Give them
whoje milk for the first three weeks at least
—the expense will be returned. A calf
should put on nine or ten pounds in a week,
but it must have the food to do it. Wean
them off the whole milk gradually; then
when the separated milk rationing begins,
add good substitutes to take the place of
the butter-fats. Flaked maize, oatmeal gruel,
oats, whole linseed and other foods not so
well known as they might be comprise
molasses (with a little salt), cod-liver _ oil
(rationed out with the milk to 3oz. daily)
and hay-tea (fairly strong). Butter-milk
is good, but has a tendency to blow.
Watch progress constantly. A good calf
will double in live weight in pine weeks if
fed properly. If it doesn’t reach this, the
tip is that it is not being well fed. A six-
weeks-old calf should get a ration something-
like this: 1 gal. separated milk, fib. good
hay, flaked oats and two or three oz.
oil cake. Add a little of the tonic foods
(molasses, cod-liver oil, hay-tea) to the
milk, and stir, and dissolve whilst hot. The
fare is not expensive.
If the calf won’t drink in the morning,
try it again at midday. Don’t allow' it
to strike until the evening. Make sure
that no twine is tossed in with the hay, or
it may form into a ball, in the stomach.
RE-PACKING V. SHED CLASSING.
“Breed”: I think “Winifred” (B.
16/5/’2B) is wrong in his advice to graziers
to avoid re-classing at the wool centres, and
very wrong when he infers that the re-
classers advise to send the clip direct off
shears. What is advised is to skirt the
fleeces and bale separately fleece wool,
pieces, bellies, locks and stains, and unless
the re-classing charges have risen lately, the
opportunity for a grazier who has not the
services of a classer to get his wool placed
on the market in the most advantageous
manner should certainly be availed of. Wool-
brokers advise it and do a lot of this work,
and the small cost of re-classing a mixed
clip generally means pence per lb. more for
the grower. Shed classing is certainly the
best; but if you are inexperienced or unable
to obtain the services of a classer, send the
clip down for re-classing.
HARD-MOUTHED HORSES.
“Omega”: “Hugh Calyptus’s” method (B.
23/5/’2B) of running the reins through the
bit-rings and back to the rings of the saddle
can be improved upon, for with a “light-on”
vehicle the saddle would be pulled all over
the place, and sore shoulders would probably
result. The hardest puller I ever drove was
easily handled in this way: A piece of har-
ness Avas made of ljin. leather in the form
of a Y and about 18 inches overall. At the
single end was a buckle, and at each of the
double ends a strong ring was fitted. It was
applied by fastening the buckle to the back
strap that led to the crupper, and so that
the double ends would lay across the saddle.
Then each rein was put through the saddle-
ring, through the bit-ring and back to the
ring of the Y-piece. With this method there
is no displacement of the saddle; the
whole pull is on the horse, and he feels every
ounce of it. in saddle or harness.
HOW TO TELL A PIG’S AGE.
“ I C.A.”: With piglets from six to ten
weeks old it is pretty much a case of judging
from appearance. With older pigs the age can
be learned from the teeth. When a pig is
six months old the corner permanent incisors
are cut. When these pointed teeth, or tusks,
on each side of the jaw are more than half
way up, the pig may be set down as nine
months old. When it is 12 months old the
central incisors, or fore teeth, will have re-
placed the milk teeth, while one or more
of the grinders will have made their appear-
ance. Nearing 15 months the permanent
incisors on each side make their appearance,
and when these are fully up the pig will be
15 months old. After that it is guesswork
unless exact dates are available.
A BABY-BEEF RATION.
“Hatter”: The unfavorable conditions in
England last winter tested the had and in-
different farmers, and the men who went
under worst were those who had gone in for
cattle-raising on the old method of buying
rough stores to market at 2J or 3 years.
Almost without exception, rough kept
too long, involved the farmer in loss so heavy
that one expert holds bullock-fattening re-
sponsible for 08 p.c. of the English farmers’
deficits.
Where the land is under cultivation in
Australia, raising baby beef is a far simpler
proposition, as the animals can bo grazed in
the open on good pasture or young crops
throughout the year. Also, in place of feed-
ing whole milk, possibly skim milk and crude
mutton-bird oil, which can be obtained at
a very low price, would give satisfactory
results. It would be an interesting experi-
ment to compare results from feeding calves
on whole milk with those obtained by skim
milk, with a tablespoon or more of the oil
added.
FERTILISER FOR FRENCH BEANS.
“Titun”: Experiments conducted by the
Vic. Department of Agriculture at Ivalimna,
the centre of the French-bean growing indus-
try of Gippsland, have shown that system-
atic manuring pays handsomely. ’ The
heavy dressing of super. (4cwt. to the acre)
plus lewt. sulphate of ammonia gave the
largest increase in yield—-BGllb. to the acre
over the unmanured check plot. Another
plot dressed with lewt. of super, and
sulp. ammon. gave an increased yield of
8151 b. above the check plot, while a dressing
of 2cwt. super, gave a gain of 586ib.
Sulp. ammon. alone, however, gave a de-
creased yield.
SEED POTATOES.
“G.L.D.” ; With most farmers the deciding
factor in buying seed potatoes is the price.
Usually about lOcwt. is planted per acre, and
with the price about £lO per ton the plant-
ing of a few acres entails a fair outlay.
When the price of fertiliser, labor, etc., is
added the crop must be classed as one of the
most expensive to grow. For that very
reason it is good business to pay a little
more for better seed.
In suitable districts it is much the best
for the farmer to select his own seed. It can
be done effectively in the field at planting
time. I have seen astounding results obtained
for little extra work. In the first place, all
strangers should be removed—that’s the first
year. When the plants are being lifted, any
very productive ones should be set on one
side and later bagged separately for seed.
If sufficient are set aside, it may be neces-
sary to save only the small tubers from these
plants.
The potato-grower in a cold district could
plant the selected seed in a separate block,
with the object of making further selections,
using the residue to plant his main crop the
following year.
Potato-growers in the warmer districts
who are in the unfortunate position of having
to purchase seed each year will get superior
results if the bags are opened up and closely
examined. If there are strangers or a mix-
ture of varieties the sample should be
avoided, as the seed-grower was at least
careless.
Cut a small slice off the stalk end of
several potatoes, and if a brownish dis-
colored circle is exposed, it most probably
indicates disease. If the seed is shooting,
closely examine the type of shoot. Perhaps
the surest sign of “run out” in potatoes is
to see long, very fine, stringy shoots. Under
no circumstances should these seeds be
planted.

ICVER since I have been interested in Radio, this
idea has been uppermost in my mind... Compac-
tness with Simplicity of Operation.
4 Our ability to make powerful radio sets in compact
cabinets is a well-established fact. Hundreds of thou-
sands of satisfied owners testify to that.
** And now the second part of my ideal has been accom-
plished... in our ONE Dial Receiving Sets. They
are so simple that a child can operate them. Stations
can be brought in perfectly with the use of but one
hand and without looking at the dial.
44 Yet nothing has been sacrificed to gain this simplicity
of operation or smallness in size. Our present Models
are more powerful, more selective and have better tone
qualities than any Receiving Sets we have ever made.”

My experience is that there is no difference
between whole or cut seed excepting, in a
dry year, when the whole seed does not dry
out as readily as the cut in badly-prepared
soil. The drying-out of the cut seed can be
reduced to a minimum, however, by dusting
the seed with dry ashes.
MORE SWARMING TIPS.
“Larrapinta”: Nowadays bee-keeping is a
highly specialised business, and only the up-
to-date apiarist secures an adequate return,
une of the most wasteful ways of increasing
the number of swarms is to allow the bees
to increase by throwing off swarms naturally.
Every bee-keeper who knows his job tries to
prevent this.
No matter what care is exercised, how-
ever, some hives will send out swarms. To
prevent these settling in inaccessible places,
drive stakes 3ft. Gin. long into the ground and
50ft. apart, right around the apiary, close up
to the hives. Across the top of each stake nail
a wooden cross-piece, and on one end of th;
cross-piece hang a short piece of rough board,
by means of a wire hook. On the bottom of
the board nail a couple of pieces of thick,
rough, dark bark, so that at a short distance
it looks like a small swarm clustered there.
Nearly every swarm which emerges will
settle on one of these lures, thus saving the
bother and waste of time of climbing trees
after swarms in the old style. Further,
when the swarm has settled, the board is
simply unhooked, carried to an empty hive,
the bees shaken off and the decoy hung back
on the stake again.
Sometimes a swarm, after coming out,
hovers for a short time and then, instead of
settling, moves off for parts unknown. The
two best ways of dealing with this sort are
to squirt the flying bees with water from
a large syringe, or throw line, dry wood-
ashes or dust into them. If these fail, the
swarm can still be stopped by means of a
mirror about one foot square. Grab the
mirror and run to get the swarm between
you and the sun (swarms nearly always
come out when the sun is shining), and then
begin to reflect the sun’s rays on to the
leading bees. Pay no heed to the main
body—keep flashing the light on to .the
leaders. It is easy to see when the mirror is
held right, for the bees show up as glittering
spots against the sky in the reflected light.
In a few minutes the leaders of the swarm
become so baffled and dazzled that they lose
all sense of direction, and sink slowly to
the ground, followed by the rest, When this
swarm is safely hived, give it some unsealed
brood to care for, and. after making sure
that the ventilation holes in the cover are
not blocked, close the entrance of the hive
bv lightly pushing a little dry grass into it.
The bees chew away the grass in an hour or
two, and by that time have lost all desire
to take up their residence elsewhere.
A USE FOR SMALL CITRUS FRUIT.
“ J.A.”: Californian citrus-growers have
formed themselves into one central associa-
tion, the directorate elected by members from
members. They control two factories, one at
Corona, for treating lemons, the other, for
oranges, in San Bernardino. It is to either
of these that all fruit goes which cannot be
profitably marketed in the usual way. The
chief product is a concentrated orange-juice,
the base of most orange drinks, which is
handled in barrels. With it the dispenser
mixes sugar, syrup and orange oil (the last
also a product of the factory) to produce
orangeade syrup. Another concentrate is
made as a base for orange soda-water, in
bottles, while most of the orange oil manu-
factured finds a ready sale among confec-
tionery- and perfume-makers. Lastly, the
pulp remaining is sold to dairy-farmers, who
use it to feed to milch cows.
Such an organisation might be run by
citrus-growers here, and with equal success.
The preliminary steps would be the hardest
—the overcoming of that dreadful apathy
and suspicion of new ideas which, as a
grower myself. I have so often encountered
in other growers.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Breed”: To protect the killing sheep
from the attacks of the dingo, let them run
in the same paddock as the milkers or other
cattle. Instinct teaches them to graze close
to the latter, and dingoes, unless they are
in mobs, will rarely go in for a kill amongst
cows that have calves.
“Pullet”: With 30 hens I had two males,
and collected an average of five eggs a day.
I isolated my two bucks. Within a week
the egg tally rose to 15 a day.
“.Tack Point”: The worst enemy the
poultry-farmer has to contend against, so
far as insect pests go, is the red mite. These
little devils infest crevices all day, and only
come out at night to feed. First of all
prevent them getting to the perches, and this
is easy enough because they will not cross
kerosene; therefore, a rag soaked in kero-
sene and tied round the ends of the perches
will keep them away. To dislodge them
from their haunts, spray creosotic oil or
kerosene emulsion.
“John R. T.”: Cockies in the north-west
Mallee (Vic.) have been puzzled by an
epidemic of blindness amongst their horses.
The animals lose their sight only after sun-
down, and in a few cases have become very
deaf as well. Observations incline us to
blame the paddy-melon, which grows pro-
lifically in the district. The same effect has
been noted elsewhere in other years.
“Biro”: Kerosene is the best oil to' apply
to fly-blown sheep, as it spreads well and
wards off future attacks to a certain extent
It should be mixed with spirits of tar, four
parts of oil to one of tar, or less oil if the
tar is very thin ; but too much tar prevents
spreading of the mixture. After rain the
flock should be carefully watched, as the
pests get busy while the wool is damp. Even
the shoulders, are not immune,
i \ Spuds dug in the morning
should be allowed to lie on the ground and
collected later in the afternoon/ To avoid
leaving any tubers behind, run the harrow
over the ground. Don t dig when the ground
is wet, for wet spuds go bad readily. And
don’t pit straight away, but allow sunlight
access to them so that the skin may be
toughened, when they are less liable to rot.
Finally, make a good and conscientious
grading and avoid being listed in the buyer’s
black book.
“Pick”: Fences will not keep them, but
the breeding of ’possums for their fur is
nevertheless practicable. The animals are
not nomadic. Having selected a hollow
tree, rock cavity, or shed roof for their home,
they will return to it every morning. Abush
their accustomed diet is gum leaves, but they
show preference at any time for fruit, grain,
green barley or willow. Provided with such
provender, and with darkened sleeping places,
’possum farming could be successfully car-
ried out on the plains, with better facilities
for their management than amongst high
trees. The process would be slow, though ;
a doe breeds but once a year, and very rarely
has more than one at a birth.
“Yufu”: “Paul” (B. 23/5/’2B) proposes a
dangerous thing when advising salts for
cows. To milking cows, Epsom salts is
poison. Far better is common cooking salt
—-a tablespoon to half-pint of water. When
a cow has trouble with her after-birth, a
drench of salt and water twice a day will
keep milk-trouble away.
“Bud-G”: When treating cattle for in-
growing horns, put the beast in a crush and
use a saw. To lever the horn out with a
stick, besides being barbarous, leaves a trail
of blood, which attracts blowflies. In all
cases smear with tar.
“Calo”: If any of your pullets begin lay-
ing well in advance of the others, mark
them for the breeding pen, as like produces
like. To ensure that heavy breeds will lay
early, have them hatched two months, if
possible, ahead of the leghorns. In cold
districts it is almost impossible to secure
broodies very early in the season, therefore
an incubator is a profitable investment.
Plenty of feed and a warm house are the
next essentials.
“Ruetania”: Waste oil from the gearbox
of a tractor may be used with advantage to
preserve wood, especially underground; also
for spraying perches and interiors of fowl-
houses.
“Rustic”: The best treatment for mange
in dogs is as follows: Mix 13,1 b. unslaked
lime with 21b. sulphur and 2 gal. water,
and boil the solution slowly for three hours.
Allow the sediment to settle, and add water
to make 10 gal., taking care that none of
the residue is left in the water. The dog
should be bathed in it twice a week, and
be cured in a month.
“Claude W.”: To waterproof canvas or
any other material, procure a number of
candles and melt them in an iron pan.
Remove the wicks. Take the pan away from
the fire, and mix in double the quantity of
benzine. Whilst the mixture is still some-
what warm, brush it over the cloth to be
waterproofed. A paint brush may be used.
Set the.cloth aside to dry a little, and then
go over the surface with a warm iron. This
helps the paraffin to soak into the fibres.
The material is now quite waterproof, and
hardly any heavier or stiffer than before.
“Paul C.” : Fat pigs are easily overheated,
and it is a common practice to dash water
over the affected animal, possibly with fatal
results. The water should be poured on
the snout, then back over the head, and so
very gradually along the body to the tail.
In this way he cools off without danger.
. “Pick”: When branding sheep with tattoo
oil. to avoid blotching the brands have a
kerosene-tin cut down to four inches with
an old bucket-handle attached. In the bottom
of the tin fit a square of sheepskin with
half-inch wool. Saturate the wool with the
oil, and use it as a brand-pad. A clean,
unsmudged brand will result.
“Biro”: Occasionally strain each cow’s
milk through a white cloth, and examine
carefully for stains of blood or pus. Small
specks of blood appearing upon the cloth are
a sure indication that a tubercular test is
needed.
“Hackensmith” ; When having a busy time
sheep-dogs usually get footsore. I find the
best. treatment is to harden the paws by
dipping them into salt and water —a table-
spoonful to a quart of water.
“Cola”: A useful tip appearing in a re-
cent Bulletin described the process of re-
lieving impaction of a fowl’s crop by cut-
ting it open, emptying it and sewing up the
opening. This method should only be re-
sorted to after less drastic measures have
been tried. A simple remedy is sour milk,
which permeates the packed grasses, etc.,
and loosens them so that they become digest-
ible. or are at least taken into the body to be
disposed of. About four tablespoonfuls of sour
milk poured gradually down the bird’s throat
will usually give quick relief. If sour milk
is placed in the drinking pan every day
when fowls are running in grassy places
they will never become cropbound.
“Cola”: Every catalogue one picks up
advises constant pushing along of cabbages,
but it is a thing that is much overdone.
So many cabbages go flabby that the vege-
table is in danger of becoming thoroughly
unpopular. The sweetest and driest are
grown without watering. Even then rain is
required in only moderate quantities, but the
soil must be kept porous and the plants well
hilled.
“Fred Rich”: Oil of tar is invaluable in
cases where horses, particularly stabled
horses, develop coughs, which, if neglected,
may turn to pneumonia. The dose, which
should be from six to nine drops, is best
given in a small pill made of butter or
vaseline, and the pill should be placed as far
down on the tongue as possible. Take care
not to let the oil touch the animal’s jaw,
as it will cause the flesh to blister.
“C.C.”: The prevalence of Irish blight this
season will turn potato-growers’ attention
towards preventives. Formalin solution was
recommended by the Department of Agri-
culture some years ago. but the expert forgot
to mention that it should not be used upon
potatoes that showed signs of shooting. I
dipped when the eyes had shot, with the
result that the whole of the crop was ruined.
So beware.
“C. O. W. .Toose”: Has any reader seen a
bull put off duty by hobbling him? If so,
how was the hobbling done? Is there any
risk attached to such a method?

A car-driver who nearly
hit a policeman in Melbourne
the other day was fined £2.
Quite right, too. A driver
who is so careless that he
misses a target that size deserves some
punishment.
The proposed visit to Hobart of Mr.
G. K. Chesterton has given rise to the sug-
gestion in Tasmania that something should
be done by the Government to weigh down
the other side of that island.
“Knees,” says a writer in the Sydney
News, “are not the most symmetrical part
of the human frame.” It is little revelations
like this that help to make everyone inter-
ested in the trend of feminine fashions.
A very weighty MS., which the judges in The
Bulletin novel competition thought might be
an S. M. Herald leader sent in by mistake,
has turned out to be a story with a Clydes-
dale horse for hero and a couple of his
slides included for luck.
The cabled report of the perfection in
America of a mechanical man that is operated
entirely by sound does not stir our envy.
We, too, have our politicians.
“Cricket,” says a news-
paper writer, “has been popu-
lar at Canberra throughout
the summer.” It is not enl.v
in summer, however, that
politicians there are on a
good wicket.
The Mate (savagely, to
sailor who has fallen sud-
denly from the rigging on top
of him) : “Here, where the
hell did you come from?”
The Sailor (proudly) :
“From th’ north uv Ireland
sir.”
According to the Sydney
Guardian, a suit made foi
a Lancaster farmer had suf-
ficient material in it to
amply clothe two young
ladies. A Lancaster native
informs us, however, that
not all farmers in his coun-
try are pygmies.
“Workers in N.5.W.,”
says a Labor lecturer, “have
to face a more dismal pro-
spect this winter than they
have in any other State.”
In other words, there was
no truth in the rumor that
the Labor Daily was clos-
ing down.

The fact that the old-fash-
ioned bustle has been revived
seems to suggest that women
have at last become convinced that, as a
concession to a few male faddists, they will
have to wear something somewhere.
A FASHION PLATE.
CUSTOMER: "I want to see some stockings,
please.”
Ex-WAITRESS: “Thick or clear, Madam?”
A WORKER.
“D’yer think er country job ud suit yer?”
asked Dad interviewing the newchum appli-
cant at the city bureau.
“Country life’ll do me, sir,” said the appli-

“Take fifteen bob er week, an’ keep?”
“Oh, yes, sir.”
“I’ve got twenty cows, in full milk.”
“TV fuller th’ better, sir.”
“You’ll ’ave ter ’elp th’ missus with the

“Certainly, sir; I’d like do th’ washing,

"An’ rise afore five?”
“Four o’clock ud do me, sir.”
“An' ’ave every second Sunday ’orf.”
“I’d rather stay an’ work, sir.”
_ We have to take Dad’s word for the above ;
it’s the explanation he made when we asked
him why on his last trip to town he had a
few beers too many.

The time at which a woman appeals mo

JUST A FEW LINES.
Most Beloved Bulletin, —I note with joy
W. E. Fitz Henry’s reply to the criticism
of his “Slaters and Martists’ Year Book.”
If lie does black-list papers, I hope he will
put The Bulletin at the head of the black-
list, for apart from the fact that it has
rejected some of my masterpieces, it is also
guilty of theft. A month ago I submitted
an epoch-making and world-shaking master-
piece, to wit, a short story, which failed to
impress the venomous snake which writes
the “Answers to Correspondents”—verily
the missing link. Well, kind ladies and
gentlemen of The Bulletin (and the “it”
that writes the Answers), not content with
making a very feeble jest at my expense
(I might have known my masterpiece was
too good for you. and sent it direct to
Beckett's Bucket), the MS. was returned
to me minus one brass fastener which held
the literary argosy together. These brass
fasteners are expensive—I paid threepence
for a box of “approximately 50, made in
Hades,” etc. —and on the basis of 150 re-
turned manuscripts each week it means an
illegal profit of ninepence; so I’m going
to have you exposed so that the public will
know how you pay your dividends—and how
you make bloated capitalists more wealthy
at the expense of the poor humble journal-
istic proletariat. Next time I’ll use a pin
and pray that the Answers fiend will prick
his thumb. —Yours disgustedly, D. S.
Winkle.
THE MADAMS; THE MISSES.
When he throws the glad eye
To the madams and misses,
His art, you'll descry.
When he throws the glad eye,
Oh, he often must sigh
That he gathers no kisses,
When he throws the glad eye
To the madams —and misses!

BECAUSE.
I'd tear the eai i.ii icitn my naked hands
To win the rarest gem for her,
And search for gold in the savage lands
.To make a diadem for her;
I’d launch my lugger from tropic beach
To harvest pearls (or drown) for her,
And blazing stars from the skies I'd reach
To deck a fiery crown for her.
And yet, though bold as knight e’er was,
I vow I’d do all that for her,
Rhe sulks, uncomforted, because —
/ won't buy that darned hat for her!

Over a year ago
we prophesied
“This new-type car (Whippet) will
make millions of light cars, not ofier-
ing its advantages of economy, safety
and good looks, obsolete.”
Todays trend shows
Whippets tremendous influence
Public Preference has swung to this
Modem Light Car of Proved Superiority
In a litde overa year’s time the Whippet
has revolutionized light car design.
With more than 200,0CX) Whippets in
the hands of enthusiastic owners, and
the popularity of this modem car in-
creasing everywhere, other makers
now must follow Whippet’s lead.
Whippet set a wholly new standard
of economy and introduced such
big car advantages into the light car
field as 4-wheel brakes, lower center
of gravity, higher speed, increased
roominess and force-feed lubrication.
Today the Whippet is still a year ahead
of the industry. For Whippet design
has been proved by hundreds of mil-
lions of miles of driving.
Even a short ride in a Whippet will
demonstrate the car’s remarkable
qualities—flashing acceleration, great
power on hills, high speed, easy riding,
convenient handling and parking,
increased safety and economy.
First light car to offer
4 - wheel brakes as
national standard
equipment.

Information Sought.
(1) What is the effect on engine efficiency
and fuel consumption of driving a car with the
choice in the out position? (2) I have a good
deal of' trouble with oily spark-plugs in my
1922 light six Htudebaker. Would fitting
spring liners under the piston-rings remedy
this? If so, where can I get them, and what’s
the price? —4898.
(1) The motor will consume an excessive
amount of petrol and power will be reduced.
(2) The fitting of spring liners will help to
reduce the trouble. Auto Parts Co., 195 Eliza-
beth-street, Sydney, supply spring liners at Is.
each. You might have better results, though,
with Perfect Circle rings, which cost about
tis. each. If the pistons have four rings,
install the Perfect Circle rings in third groove
from top, and an oil wiper ring in bottom
groove below gudgeon pins or on the skirt
of the piston. If the pistons are of the tliree-
rmg type the Perfect Circle ring can be
installed in the bottom groove.
(1) What size vessel can enter Queen’s
Channel ( N.T. ), and for what distance is the
Victoria River navigable and by what sized
ship? (2) What size vessel can enter Port
McArthur, and how far is the McArthur
River (N.T.) navigable and by what size
ship? —4595.
(1) The depth of water in Queen’s Chan-
nel varies from nine to five fathoms. Ves-
sels drawing 12ft. to 13ft. can travel about
45 miles up the Victoria River, which is
navigable by smaller craft for about 100
miles. At this point the river is barred, and
beyond there is only navigable in boats. (2)
Vessels of large draught visiting Port Mc-
Arthur must anchor in the shelter of the
Sir Edward Pellew group. The McArthur
River is navigable for 12 miles by vessels
drawing tip to lift., but smaller craft, draw-
ing up to 3ft. 6in., can proceed to Borro-
loola, about 40 miles from the mouth of the
stream.
How can I ascertain the h.p. of suction,
gas and oil engines? —4632.
To carry out a brake-horsepower test you
will require a revolution counter, a watch
with a second hand, and a brake, either of
the prony or rope form, depending on whether
a belt; pulley is fitted on the engine or not.
Detailed information as to the method of
ascertaining the h.p. can be obtained by con-
sulting the following references at the nearest
technical library: McKay’s “Theory of
Machines” (chap. 30) ; Carpenter’s "Experi-
mental Engineering” (chap. 8); Marks’s
“Engineers’ Handbook” (pp. 1686-7).
How can 1 work red, coloring into a cement
floor? —4798.
Use a surfacing mortar consisting of three
parts sand to one part of cement, to which is
added red oxide in the proportion of about
one-tenth of the quantity of cement used.
Is it possible to improve the appearance
of radio dials and panel that are dull and
scratched? —4877.
Slight scratches can be removed from a
bakelite panel by means of Brasso, which
should be well rubbed in until the scratches
have disappeared. Then finish off with John-
son’s furniture cream. The job is a tedious
one. If the scratches are more than surface
deep it is practically impossible to remove
them.
(1) What is the best kind of spray for
treating a flock of 1200 sheep to keep off
blowflies, and what is the cost? (2) What
is the best solution to use? —4862.
(1) Macpherson, Keep, Ltd., of Sydney,
supply a good hand-operated spray at a cost
of about £l4. You will also need a tank
for the solution. (2) Use any first-class sheep-
dip powder. One packet of the dip may be
made into a creamy mixture with 25 gallons of
water, the powder and water being gradually
intermixed. Blown sheep should have indi-
vidual treatment. A weak solution of the
dip, about half strength, should be used, and
afterwards sprinkle the affected parts with a
powder consisting of boracic acid and starch
in equal parts. It may be necessary to re-jet
these sheep with full-strength solution.
(1) Is there a market for snake venom, and
if so, at what price? (2) What is the address
of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute? (3)
Does it buy venom?. —1896.
(1) There is no commercial market. Occa-
sionally the stuff is needed for scientific re-
search, and up to £IOO an oz. has been
paid to meet an urgent requirement, but
almost all institutions and research workers
interested have established their own chan-
nels of supply. The Director, Herpetological
Institute, Sao Paulo, Brazil, might give you
an order. (2) Melbourne Hospital, Lonsdale-
street. (3) Yes, but it has made its arrange-
ments.
My sheep are running on well-grassed trap
rock country, but are infested with worms.
(1) What are the right proportions of arsenic
and Epsom salts for a dose? Will the salts
dissolve the arsenic without adding soda? (2)
Should tobacco be added? (3) Can you pre-
scribe a good sheep lick? (4) Are tar and
turpentine beneficial in a salt lick? —474s.
(1) Arsenic, 1 to 2gr.; Epsom salts, 4 to
6oz. You can either use the arsenic and
soda formula prescribed by the various Gov-
ernment departments, or make up with Fow-
ler’s solution of arsenic, which contains 4?,gr.
to the oz. (2) No. (3) 801 b. salt; ljlb.
sulphate of iron ; 1 Jib. sulphur; 41b. sweet
bonemeal. (4) No.
The hair of a youth of 18 is getting thin
on top. Would it be possible to check this?
Members of his father's family have gone
bald at an early age. —4so9.
Baldness is not necessarily hereditary,
although it sometimes runs in families, it
is unlikely that anything can be done..
(1) What is the best ivay to locate water
in the coastal areas of N. Q'land? (2) Is
there any test to decide whether it is
poisonous ? —4539.
(1) Look out for the pandanus-tree, for
where this tree grows fresh water can be
obtained at a shallow' depth. In other
localities animal pads invariably lead to a
soak, or w'hat was at one time a soak.
(2) If you can’t have an analysis made, give
an animal a drink. Poisonous water is very
rare in Australia.
What was the amount of tax for which
the Federal Government brought an action
against Sidney Kidman, and what was the
result? —4692.
A writ for £156.066 14s. 3d., for Federal
land tax. was issued out of the High Court
on August 25, 1924, in the absence of re-
turns and necessary information for deter-
mining the true liability. The case was
twice adjourned. Returns were then supplied
enabling the true liability to be ascertained.
The High Court ordered the writ to be
amended to show the amount due as ascer-
tained from the returns lodged, and when
the case again came before the Court on
May 16, 1927, the tax due had been paid
and the case was struck out by consent.
What is the quickest and easiest method
of exterminating cockroaches? —4915.
Mix some roasted apple with a little white
arsenic, powdered; divide the apple so pre-
pared into small bits, and place it in the
room at night. Don’t leave the baits where
children or domestic animals can get at them.
Has the, King of England, like the Presi-
dent of the United States, the power to re-
fuse his assent to a Bill passed by Parlia-
ments—4769.
Theoretically, yes, but the right hasn’t
been exercised since the time of Queen Anne.
Constitutionally the Sovereign must act
upon the advice of his Ministers, and since
they invariably advise that assent be given
to passed Bills, the question of veto does not
arise.
In your answer to 4159 (B. 18/4/’2B)
you say that a bullet fired from the rear of
a train travelling at 1500 miles an hour
would reach the driver, as the velocity of
the train would be added to the velocity of
the bullet. But what would happen if the
driver fired at someone at the rear of the
train? .4s you have stated in reply to 4424.
there would be no question of wind resist-
ance or assistance, the train being enclosed.
—4971.
If the muzzle velocity of the bullet were
sufficiently in excess of the speed of the
train —2200 ft. per second —it would reach
its objective. The force of impact, as com-
pared with the same bullet fired from the
same gun from a stationary position at a
stationary object, would be lessened in pro-
portion to the degree to which the speed of
the train detracted from the speed of the
bullet. If both speeds were equal the bullet
would drop flat as soon as it emerged from
the muzzle.
/ want directions for making a concrete
tennis court, to be colored green or red, with
lines permanently marked. Where could I
get specifications and details of construc-
tion ? —4560.
The outer line dimensions are 78ft. by
39ft., but it is usual to pave an area 100 ft.
by 50ft, or more to give a margin for play.
For concrete base, Bin. thick, use 1 part
cement to 2 parts clean coarse sand (largest
grains not over Jin. diameter) and 4 parts
clean screened gravel (not less than jin.
or over tin. diameter), reinforced at top
with No. 14 R.R.C. fabric. Do your paving
in sections, joints coinciding witji marked
lines and net. line. Surface with Jin. layer
of I part cement to 2 parts fairly fine
clean sand. You will need 421 b. cement for
each sq. yd. of base course and 181 b. for
each sq. yd. of surfacing. Paper cement
bags contain 941 b. Don’t advise green for
coloring. For red, add Jib. iron oxide to
each bag of cement used in surfacing. You
can get a special white paint for marking
that will last a year, or you can form ljin.
or 2in. channels between joint lines and
fill them in with white cement mortar.
Brown and Dureau, Ltd., 422-428 Collins-
street, Melbourne, will give you further
details.
(1) How can 1 qualify for a position in
the Vic. Forests Commission service? _ (2)
Must applicants undergo a course of training
and ivhat is the cost? (3) What salaries arc
paid? —4s96.
(1) and (2) The permanent field staff
of the Commission is recruited from lads
who have successfully passed through a
course of training at the School of Forestry,
Creswick (Vic.), entrance to which is ob-
tained by an examination usually held yearly
during the last week in January. Applicants
must have been educated up to Intermediate
Certificate standard in specified subjects.
Candidates who pass the entrance and medi-
cal examinations are nominated for a three
years’ course of training embracing silvi-
culture, botany, forest management, wood
technology, insect and plant diseases, mathe-
matics, surveying, English, geology, chem-
istry, physics, book-keeping and commercial
principles. Successful candidates are granted
a scholarship equivalent to £4B, £52 and £56
in the first, second and third years respec-
tively, from which sums £45 p.a. is deducted
for board and residence. Instruction is free,
and the balance of the allowance is paid to
the student to cover cost ,of text-books. The
student’s parents and guardians are required
to furnish two bonds of £SO each that he
will complete the course and serve at least
three years in the forest service. (3) Forest
cadets from £l5O to £156 p.a.; assistant
foresters, £2OB to £286; foresters. £286 to
£403; chief foresters and inspectors, £416 to
£545.
(1) Would' it pay to fertilise the natural
grasses (couch and paspalum ) of a pad-
dock that is cleared but impossible to culti-
vate? (2) If so, what fertiliser should I
use, quantity to acre, mode of application,
and cost ? —4613.
(1) Yes. (2) Two cwt. of superphosphate
to the acre, applied in August; cost, includ-
ing freight and cartage, about 11s. per acre.
Use a special top-dressing machine or apply
with a seed drill having a fertiliser box
attached. If no machine is available, dis-
tribute by scattering from the rear of a
dray or . spring cart.
Up here in N.Q. I have a deposit of
rutile and ilmenite. Hoskinses and the B. 11.
Prop, steel people don't want it. Is there
a maA'ket anywhere? —43loA.
No market in Australia. Limited quan-
tities may be sold overseas. Rutile concen-
trates assaying 96 p.c. titanic acid may fetch
£45 per ton delivered overseas, whilst ilmen-
ite concentrate assaying around 52 p.c. may
bring from £5 to £9 per ton. Send fail-
sample to Frank Hambridge, 22 Bridge-
street, Sydney, who will advise you.
(1) Is an aerial containing a large num-
ber of strands (such as “Mars”) more
effective than 7/20 Popper? (2) If so, what
length of 7/20 would be equal to 100 feet
of “Mars”? (3) Would raising an aerial
from 40 to 50 feet give an appreciable gain
in signal strength? (4) How can signal
strength be retained dwing rain? —4710.
(1) Finely stranded wire offers a
lower resistance to high-frequency currents
than does a 7/20 wire*. In actual practice
the results obtained do not differ greatly.
(2) “Mars” wire is used in preference to
the usual wire for the reason stated above.
By increasing the length of your aerial, you
increase its resistance and also its ability
to pick up static. An aerial should be kept
as short as possible, preferably not longer
than 100 feet. (3) Yes. Increase height to
50ft. and reduce the horizontal span to about
50 feet, unless you are employing a crystal
receiver. (4) Use high-grade insulators at
both ends of your aerial, and pay particu-
lar attention to the insulation of the lead-
in tube. The receiver and receiver tuning-
coils should occasionally be placed near a fire
in damp weather to dry out the moisture, or
an electric lamp may be placed inside the
receiver for a few hours.
A youth between 16 and 17 years of age
has been employed by an unlicensed plumber
for 15 months in a N.- S. Wales country
town. He is not apprenticed, hut works at
the trade. What rate of wages can he claim?
-4923.
The plumbers and gasfitters’ awards for
Cumberland and Newcastle districts pre-
scribe that minors entering the trade shall
be apprenticed. There is no award applying
to the rest of the State, but the employment
of unapprenticed juniors is a breach of
Board of Trade regulations. Hence no rates
of pay are provided.

POVERTY
POINT
“Goldilocks”: The Fullers do give work
to Australians, but they are not notably
high paymasters; and this characteristic is
enshrined in a yarn treasured by Thespians.
For its purposes, Ben Fuller received his
knighthood personally at the hands of King
George. "Arise, Sir Benjamin,” said his
Maj. “Not until you’ve been twice round
the circuit,” said Ben automatically.
“0.R.”: The latest heroes to challenge
Hollywood are the Craigow Picture Produc-
tions Pty., Ltd. They have secured 50
acres at Corio Bay, near Geelong, and within
easy reach of mountain, bay, sea and plain.
The popular idea is that this part of
toria has no sunlight, but it is precisely be-
cause of its clear air and abundant natural
illumination that the concern has chosen it.
“A.G.M.” (Loud.) : Madge Elliott’s first
appearance at a West End theatre as
leading lady has been a huge success. The
long run which seems assured for the new
musical comedy, “So This Is Love,” at the
Winter Garden, will be largely due to her
attractive work and that of her very competent
partner, Cyril Ritchard. There is no finer
dancer on the London stage than Miss
Elliott, and in the new show’ she is given
ample scope for the display of net- very
effective singing voice and excellent acting.
Her picturesque appearance is a valuable'
asset, and she may now be set down as a
fully-established London star. The critics
a.re unanimous in their eulogy of her Pamela
Stuart. Reita Nugent, graceful and viva-
cious as ever, delighted the house by her
acrobatic dancing, and had a remarkable
reception. Altogether it was a great night
for Australia!
“C. 8.”; When all is said, grand-opera
quality depends on finance. The excellence
of the orchestral accompaniment of the
Williamson-Melba season, with its frequent
changes, was described by one fervent Mel-
bourne critic as miraculous. But there was
nothing miraculous about it; £2060 had been
spent on rehearsals before the curtain went
up on the opening night.
“Wood’s Green” (Lond.) : Franco de Gre-
gorio, the tenor whom Tom Quinlan took to
Australia on the first visit of the Quinlan
Opera, is flow doing well teaching singing
in New York. Godfrey Ludlow, the Aus-
tralian violinist, has also been gathering
in pupils in the same city, where he teaches
the young idea how to shoot according to the
methods of Auer and Sevcik, and Clementine
de Vere and her husband, Romualdo Sapio,
two old favorites with the Australian publ e,
have done so well as teachers there'that they
are able to run a studio on R.versido-drive,
where the rents are of skyscraper altitude.
“M.G.S.”: “E.T.” (B. 16/5/’2B) asks
what keeps Sardou’s 50-year-old “Diplo-
macy” alive. Having just come away from
Margaret Bannerman’s revival- —not the
best, although ; per-
haps the best-dressed,
Australia has seen—l
should think it is Sar-
dou’3 strong grip of
the theatrical essen-
t i a 1 s. Sentiment,
action and simple
moral purpose are
evenly mixed and the
interest properly
spread over the whole
evening. Some modern
playwrights regard the
stage as a pulpit, and
others rush on to it
with a vague sense of
beauty aching for ex-
pression. These things,
meritorious as they
are, will not keep an
audience of tired citi-
zens quiet from 8 till
11 p.in. Another fac-
tor which makes “Dip-
lomacy” look freshly
minted is the inter-
national situa tio n.
The virtues are shared
by Englishmen,
Frenchmen and Span-
iards, while the dirty
work is done by Rus-
sians and Germans.
Playgoers will still be
enjoying “Diplomacy”
20 years hence, when,
maybe, Americans and
Japs will be dividing the villainy and
Englishmen, Russians and Germans bearing
the halo of virtue.
“Gwy”: The most ambitious film yet
attempted in Maoriland is the project of
Alexander Marky. It will deal with the life
of the Maoris before the coming of the
pakelia, and there will be plenty of fighting,
native custom and superstition to give it life
and atmosphere. Some of the action has
been shot already at Whakatane and Rotorua,
and a party including 60 Maoris wont to
White Island, where the cameras cranked in
a sulphurous setting, catching uncanny
glimpses of dusky warriors dancing in dense
columns of vapor. Marky describes the
Maoris as excellent extras, not a bit camera-
conscious—in fact, much superior for action
to the average tamed white. Other scenes
are being taken at Ohiwa, near Whakatane,
where a big battle will be shot. The ancient
pa is being rebuilt, and 60 canoes have been
collected from various parts of the Shivery
Isles for an attack by water. Close on 1000
supers will take part in the big scenes. The
film appeals to Maori pride, and the pro-
ducer is getting a lot of assistance from
representative men.
“Ex Dig.”: The adoption of “Tommy’s
French Wife” by the movies reminds me
■ of having seen that
crude melodrama
on the stage. It
was at the Ele-
phant and Castle
Theatre, London—
a playhouse where
the villain was
greeted with loud
hisses before he
had time to show
he was the villain
(the audience knew
"his job), and the
hero received
applause at his first
entrance; and
where also a bat-
talion of ushers
hud to howl dowui
the pandemonium
of execrations or
cheers with cries
of “Order, gentle-
men, phase!” every
few minutes. The
most stirring
moment came when
the villain refused
to do a dirty deed
to which the villain-
ess was prompting
him ; in the excess
of her emotion the
flapper - who occu-
pied the front stall
just ahead of toe
withdrew the toffee
she had been rat-
tling against her
teeth and hurled it
at the adventuress,
yelling, “Put ; that
in your pipe and
smoke it.” It missed
its mark, but hit
the bookcase paint-
ed on the front
cloth behind her,
and clung, and
every time that front cloth was subse-
quently lowered I saw the sticky mass still
clinging there.
“Craiser”: Many composers besides Verdi
have had a shot at the well-known fairy-
tale of Gozzi, which is the basis of “Turan-
dot.” Busoni’s effort (l0l7) is the only one
to survive.
“Caxton’s Ghost”: When Maoriland’s
cinema concern’s first picture, “Hamil-
ton Husbands,” came before the censor, he
rejected the title. The film will now appear
with the inspired title, “Military Defaulters
and Others.”
“L. de R.”: Is there anything more ephem-
eral than opera? In a recent standard work
203 composers are credited with 512 works
worthy of mention. Probably their Wm
output was 10 times as much. Yet the Wil-
liamson-Melbas claim to have a pretty com-
prehensive list of those certain of popular
approval with a repertoire of 20.
“S.T.S,” “What,” asks “E.T.” ’ (B.
16/5/’2B), “makes ‘Diplomacy’ worth ’fre-
quent revival?” In its day the piece 'was
voted by sound judges absolutely the ‘best
thing known to the modern stage; and
though half a century has made it seehi a
bit too old-fashioned, it can serve as a
model of construction to the careless young
playsmiths who sneer at it as “machine-
made.” The situations are tense, the
treacherous woman is a gorgeous chance for
any actress a bit beyond her first youth,
and the great quarrel scene has all its old
thrill for those who can be thrilled without
American slang and revolvers.
“Spero”: “Rigalt” is wrong in his sur-
mise (B. 30/5/’2B) that the Ibsen centenary
is receiving no recognition here. “The
Master Builder” was revived in Melbourne
last month by Beresford Fowler, and “Ros-
mersholm” and “An Enemy of the People”
are shortly to be staged in the same city.
“St. John’s Wood” (Loud.) : So many
minor actresses, are exploited in Australia
as London stars that it is a diverting novelty
to find Renee Kelly, because of her Austra-
lian successes, being promptly accepted on
her return as leading lady for a West End
production. She has been elaborately para-
graphed in the press as a great Australian
discovery, and will have the chief part in
William A. Grew’s new play of adventure
“The House with the Purple Stairs.”
“Caxton’s Ghost": The movie men have
filmed Tom Heeney’s birthplace, his mother,
his father, and the barn where lie learned
to box. The great picture will he released
all over Yankeelamd before the fight.
“L.H.P.”: “The Scarlet Letter” on the
screen reminds me that a capital dramatisa-
tion of Hawthorne’s yarn was staged at the
Theatre Royal, Sydney, in June, 3878. Mrs.
THE MEREST TRIFLE.
BIG ACTOR: “My dear fellow, I’d lend you the pound if I
thought you’d pay it back.”
LITTLE ACTOR “Pay it back! Why, man, in my new play I
make £5000 in the first act!”
Scott Siddons scored as Hetty
Geo. Chaplin was the Minister. The same
season Mrs. Siddons starred as Puck (a
strange role for the lead) in a superb pro-
duction of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,”
with beautiful scenery by W. J. Wilson.
“M.II.”: It happened during a Benson
performance of “Hamlet.” The very nervous
Queen braced herself to cheer up the gloomy
one with the line, “Good Hamlet, cast thy
nighted color off.” The first four words were
perfect, but the rest, “cast thy colored
nightie off,” broke up a sober house.
“L.H.P.”: “Children in Arms One
Guinea” was the effective way the Sydney
Victoria Theatre manager, B. N. Jones, kept
out babies during the Creswick Shakspearean
season of 1878.
“L.H.P.” : There are two Latin, 16 French,
six English and four Italian plays of Antony
and Cleopatra. The simple mounting of
the Allan Wilkie version of the Shakspeare
one brings out all its beauty, which was apt to
be lost in the gorgeous mounting provided
by Oscar Asche in 1913. By cutting out
flummery Wilkie has been able to perform
all the Misenum scenes, dropped by Asche,
and to present a fine acting version of the
tragedy.
"P.C.” : When I paid a visit to a picture
show in Vavau (Tonga) the other evening
I saw the film, in order that the native
audience might understand it better, pro-
jected in. slow-motion fashion. Further, an
interpreter stressed the salient features of
the plot to make a dead cert of the Tongans
not mistaking an unmistakable villain for
the hero. I was therefore not very surprised
when, the whale in the film having bitten
off the hero’s leg, the band blithely tuned
into “Show Me the Way to Go Home!”
“Santander”: Fatty Arbuckle is still
yearning to chuck his adiposeness about in
some Hollywood studio, but that centre of
art and learning will have none of him.
Fatty is therefore compelled to earn a mere
living as a vaudeville artist, warbling moony
songs and wie-oling his row of chins, at
which pastimes lie is not becoming exactly
a rage. Lately he invaded Paris, and though
many of the audience must have seen him
in the heyday of his cellulebrity, they unani-
mously refrained from giving a greeting
when he ventured a little ditty in English.
After that Fatty left for another address,
unknown.

Good health is the greatest prize in the world, and it
often depends upon one small but very important
thing; the regular clearance from the system of
the waste products of digestion. The neglect of
your “inner health” may lead to the most
serious illness.
Yet how easily and pleasantly ENO over-
comes this danger. For generations the
pleasant, health-giving practice of taking
a glass of water sparkling with a dash of
ENO first thing every morning has been
passed down from father to son. and
from mother to daughter. Keep good
health in your family; have a bottle
of ENO always in the house.

The Struggle for a Crust.
“Dixie” : Into the office of a Sydney jour-
nal there recently came a package of manu-
script, accompanied by two Ikl. stamps, and
the following note: “I enclose two 1-Jd.
stamps with my story for postage should it
prove unsuitable. Should it be accepted,
kindly use one stamp to post the cheque,
and return the other.”
“Carisbrook, Jun.” : No need to go outside
Australia for faked antiques. In the days
when the tourist steamers brought full pas-
senger-lists to Cooktown, quite a roaring
trade was done in walking-sticks, etc., from
the tree to which Captain Cook allegedly
tied his famous ship when he beached her
in the Endeavor River.
Lord Nortlicliffe recognised a kindred
spirit behind the clerical garb in the recently-
dead Dr. Fitchett. He offered the Melbourne
parson 300 guineas and all exes, if he
would go to London and write one article
on King Edward’s coronation. Fitchett did
it. At over 80 Fitchett was in the habit
of getting up at five and overworking his
ink-bottle all day. His last article, published
in the Akgus, was on “Chicago and the
Churches,” and was as belligerent as ever.
The Younger Brushes :
Allan T. Bernaldo, at the New Gallery, Melbourne,
is an incipient Sep Power, with some of that
ingenious fabricator’s talent for planting a high
light on a horse’s haunch in what looks like the
right place. But he is more than the mere illus-
trator that Power often is. . His landscapes show
close observation and he handles his paint with a
solidity and confidence rare in water-colorists.
Aileen Dent (Athenamm) is a young lady who
attacks her subjects—usually portraits of elderly-
persons—with immense enthusiasm and vigoi, shortly
begins to slacken and is in full retreat before the
end is near. This is a pity, because her portraiture
is full of character and only needs refinement in
tonal qualities to be very good indeed. This
she has got into her still-lifes and one or two
landscapes with excellent results.
“Pick”: There are few crafts at which
the blind cannot become proficient now-
adays. At the Boomerang-street Institute
(Sydney) blind brush-makers work with
boiling pitch, and sightless piano-repairers
with heated glue. Here, too, you may find
the champion basket-maker of the Common-
wealth • with his hands and feet he can throw
together a cane clothes-basket faster than
any known man whose sight is unimpaired.
The blind employees find their ways to and
from work without guides, though many re-
side in distant suburbs. A blind resident of
Hornsby works as a cabinetmaker and
French polisher; he learned both trades after
completely losing his eyesight through an
accident. Finally, there is a blind wool-
sorter well known in the Western sheds.
And the smarty who tries to work off a
joke on him by bringing back the same fleece
soon hears of it.
“W.0.C.”: White ants soon get busy on
the wooden sleepers of Queensland railways,
and many hundreds of miles of line arc
always requiring new ones. There are not
enough repairers on the various lengths to do
more than relay a few sleepers here and there,
and it is wonderful there are not acci-
dents. Surely wooden sleepers might be re-
placed by iron ones in dry areas where
white ants are bad. I have seen numerous
cases where the former have sunk into a
gravelled track through sheer rottenness, and
dog-spikes loose everywhere. The rail could
be bolted on to iron sleepers.
“R.T.”: After carving out best sellers for
the N.S.W. Bookstall Co.’s series of Aus-
tralian novels for
many years, Arthur
Wright has turned his
attention to London
and succeeded in plac-
ing two books, one, “A
Crooked Game,” with
George Newnes, Ltd.,
and the other, “Gam-
ing for Gold,” with
John Long.
“Murrungurry”:
After all, most big
gold-findp have been
accidental. Arthur
Bayley was after a
restless horse in the
dusk when he stumbled
over the show-cap of
Coolgardie a golden
protuberance from
which he and Jack
Ford dollied 500
ounces before they
went to bed. Mount
Morgan was found by
Bill McKinlay, a stock-
man on Calliungal
squattage. He was
after cattle. Mt.
Browne goldfield first
revealed its secret to
two horsemen, Thomp-
son and Ashwin, who
had knelt down to
drink at a little run-
ning stream. Coarse
specks of water-worn
gold gleamed on the
sandy bed. That local-
ity is still a profitable
specking field after
rain. A man named
Adams stumbled across
the Hawkins Hill reef
at Hill End while look-
ing for a horse.
“Mela”: Mission work in the Islands is
responsible for the petering out of the
interesting and lucrative business of porpoise
chasing. Not many years back several fast
cutters were engaged solely in catching por-
poises between Sydney and Eden. Good
teeth were then a medium of trade with the
South Sea Islands, and realised 15s. per
100 at Burns, Philp and Co.’s headquarters
in Sydney. With the progress of the mis-
sionary this business languished and event-
ually died, an educated black brother being
no longer satisfied with a string of teeth in
return for his season’s copra crop.
“W.M.S.”: In the early days kangaroo-
skin was in common use for footwear in the
bush. Now we rarely see it, though in fine-
ness of texture, flexibility and durableness it
is unsurpassed. I have a press report of the
first agricultural show held in Wagga
(N.S.W.) on November. 1871, wherein it is
stated that “Mr. Beeson’s boots were the
admiration of everyone. They were made of
kangaroo leather. The animals were caught
and the skins were tanned in the Wagga
district.” It would be difficult to carry on
such an industry in this centre nowadays,
but any amount of material is still avail-
able in other parts of Australia.
ANOTHER FATAL FLIGHT.
“Poor old Bill Prog’s dead. ’Flu.”
“Terribly risky game. Cemeteries getting
full of airmen.”
“Herodot”: A feat was accomplished the
other day by the N.S.W. Railway Depart-
ment when two overhead bridges weighing
1500 tons were lifted three feet at Ryde
station. The object was to place them
on new concrete bases, the greatly in-
creased traffic having necessitated the
strengthening of the structures. The job
was put through by 100 men, with 14
hydraulic and 10 ordinary hand jacks, in a
little less than four hours.
BALLADE OF BRASS TACKS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN]
I often talk about my Art,
The; sacrifices I must make
To ease my palpitating heart
Of songs that almost make it break.
The public no excuse will take.
And I should be extremely rash
Such conversation to forsake
When what I really want is cash.
To each has been assigned a part:
The painter, slinging crimson-lake,
Would never be considered smart
Without a vast black wideawake;
Also, he should appear a rake
And wear a tie more like a sash.
No subterfuge is too opaque
If what he really wants is cash.
MORE COUNTERFEITS.
WIFEY: “Darling, I don’t believe it’s a genuine bird of paradise
I think it’s only a nom-de-plume.
The young musician well may start
With velvet coats, which often shake
Fame’s apples right into his cart.
If sentimental bosoms quake
Responsive to his fiddle’s ache
Or noble chords that roll and crash,
Why reprehend the harmless fake
When what he really wants is cash?
Envoy.
Prince, will you tell me if my cake
Is dough, my omelette gone to smash,
Or if this rhyme my thirst may slake
By bringing in a little cash?

FAR. AIHEAD
of pretending competition
Drive a Chrysler to Prove a Chrysler
Only by taking a demonstra-
tion can you understand
Chrysler superiority.
Only by riding in a Chrysler
-whether “52,” “62” “12” or
100 h. p. Imperial “80” can
you realise how much the im-
provements and refinements
initiated for its cars of higher
price and passed on through
Standardised Quality to its
cars of lesser price mean in
unparalleled comfort, ease
and safety.
Only by taking the wheel
yourself and driving in the
manner you are wont to drive
and over accustomed roads
can you appreciate just how
different is Chrysier’s extra-
ordinary power, dash, alert-
ness in traffic, smoothness at
all speeds.
You will then learn for your-
self that Chrysler is superior
not only to those cars sell-
ing at the same price, but that
it surpasses even the perform-
ance of cars costing far more
than the Chrysler.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Grosvenor, who did so well over hurdles
last year, has been a disappointment this
season, but the Payten stable has a good
substitute in Triplex. Six to one for the
Second Hurdle Race at Itandwick on Satur-
day, this Kenilworth chestnut jumped
cleverly and , had too much pace for his
opponents on the flat; the ancient Stony
(20 to 1) was second and Burraform (5
to 1) third. This fellow is a slow beginner
and would probably do better in races over
the big timber; indeed, people were rather
surprised when he was withdrawn from the
A..T.C. Steeplechase. Pildin, the 5-to-2
favorite, was interfered with when going
well, but it is unlikely that he could have
beaten Triplex, who has 9st. 61b. in the
Grand National.
Grey Friar, a dashing jumper from Vic-
toria —he is owned by veteran P. T. Hey-
wood and trained by his son—won both
•steeplechases at the meelring and never once
looked like losing either. He went out at
5 to 4 for the £2OOO affair on Saturday and
fenced magnificently, while he had far too
much pace for the others left in after
Epergne (4 to 1) had run off. Perpetual (12
to 1), a game little Sea Prince mare (she
is only 14.3), also from Victoria, showed
wonderful cleverness in taking the timber
and finished second; Cliandonia (33 to
1), the hurdler, was third. Grey Friar, who
was ridden very confidently _by Kreigher,
will have plenty of friends in the Grand
National, even though a 101b.' penalty lias
brought his weight to lOst. 131 b. The
"about three miles” were .traversed in 6min.
28sec.
King Cyllene (7 to 1), who has come good,
with a vengeance in his eighth year, made
hacks of his opponents in the Winter Stakes.
Certainly they were an indifferent lot, but
the King gave most of them heaps of weight
and came right away from them over the,
last furlong of 13, run in 2min. 47?,5ec.;
Divulge (6 to 1) and Luddenham (o to 1)
secured places. It is not very long since
the rather mean-looking son of imported
Cyllene—Drama Queen was reckoned a mere
plater, and past his prime at that. Now
he has won three good distance races in suc-
cession and is likely to be one of the early
favorites for the Metrop.
Backed from sevens to 7 to 2, Preposterer
got up just in time to beat Factor (7 to 1)
in the Flying Handicap, and thereby spoiled
big Factor-King Cyllene doubles booked by
followers of the Abbs stable. Second-last
at one stage, Preposterer put in a long run
and Crowley rode a strong finish. The un-
lucky and rather harshly-treated Nandillyan
(7 to 1) came in third, but the jockey failed
to draw the weight and Mullabawn (7 to
1) got the position. The same boy was on
Pigeon Pie, who, spiritedly backed at sevens,
was narrowly beaten by Zuleika (5 to 1)
in the Exeter Handicap, so it was a bad day
for the stable, of which John Wren is a
patron. Zuleika is owned by Dick Wootton
and was ridden by little Baker. Richard s
faith in that rising apprentice, rudely
criticised though he was for it, has been
amply rewarded.

* * * *
A sensation was provided at Moonec A al-
ley on Saturday by Urbani in the Banya
Hurdle. The Quaestor gelding, when a hot
favorite, had run a very bad race in the
Marlborough Hurdle at Flemington on the
second day of the Birthday meeting, and
there was plehty of 8 to 1 on offer against
him on this occasion, Arcadius being first
choice at twos. Always well up, Urbani took
charge about a mile from home, and, with
Arcadius falling at the last hurdle, won with
ridiculous ease by 10 lengths from another
of Cecil Godby’s string in King David (20
to 1), Nelanjie (20 to 1) being third.
The explanation which satisfied the stewards
was that Urbani had travelled much more
kindly for Jackson than he had done for
Hughie Cairns at Flemington.
Godby’s unpopularity was fleeting, as for
the next race, the Warroona Welter, he
saddled up AVillowyn (5 to 2), who won well
from Double Duty (11 to 2), and Lauriston
(20 to 1). Ashley Reed rode the Blankney
11. gelding, who races in C. B. Kellow’s colors.
ANOTHER AMATEUR-PRO.
“Poor old Bertie was run in last night lor playing two-up.”
“Gracious! Docs that make him forfeit his amateur status?”
There were only seven starters for the
Brunswick Steeple, and it proved a good
thing for Glentronie (2 to 1), a very clever
fencer. After letting a rather promising new-
comer in Reviser have the lead for the greater
part of the journey, Glentronie went to the
front'and stayed there. Zeally was easing him
up at the finish, Loch Eaton being, second and
Reviser third. The winner is in the National
at 9st. 101 b.
Two old stagers in Llanthony and Smoke
Bomb were backed for the Nonga Handicap,
but the race ended in a hollow victory for
Spearer’s brother Elarby (7 to 1). who was
followed home at a respectful distance by
Kirrkie (20 to 1) and Segmu (20 to 1).
Morrie McGrath trains Elarby for Mrs.
L. R. Buxton. Another of McGrath’s string,
the Valais mare Valtcan, was favorite for
the Iveera Welter, but was left , at the post.
Green ray (11 to 2), after looking hopelessly
out of it, got a run- on the rails and won
brilliantlv from Phonic (5 to 1) -and Burra
Wallah (25 to 1).
Eric Connolly, owner of Murillo, has been
disqualified for 12 months over the running
of Broken Doll, an ill-supported failure at
Aspendale on May 23 and a heavily-backed
winner in much better company at Fleming-
ton on June 2. An appeal is to be heard
this week.
“Bon R.”: Those who took 20 to 1 Kil-
larney and Woolita for the Stradbroke Han-
dicap and Brisbane Cup double burnt their
fingers badly. Killarney did not get a place
and Woolita did not start. It generally
takes a good horse to win the Brisbane Cup,
and Canning Queen showed herself really
good by running home ahead of In Petto
and Rhymond (a winner in Sydney) in the
lively time of 3min. 2245ec., which broke
the Australian record for two miles. Ridden
by A. E. Davis, she was favorite at 5 to 2.
She is owned by I‘. J. O’Shea, treasurer of
the Q.T.C., and is trained by P. J. llealy.
Queensland-bred, by Ilighfield—-Carina, Can-
ning Queen has Carbine blood in her on the
dam’s side.
On the concluding day of the Q.T.C. meet-
ing Canning Queen was made favorite for
the Moreton Handicap, but had to strike
her colors to Kitty Paddington (6 to 1) and
unlucky Rhymond. The distance was a mile
and a .quarter, which is rather too short for
her. Magdaff, second favorite, was fifth.
High Syce, though not quite at his best at
this meeting, was in sufficiently good form
to win the Royal Stakes at w.f.a. from All-
mag and Soulton. He has been nominated
for the A.J.C. Metropolitan, so perhaps we
are to see him in Sydney at last.
Felstead’s win in the Epsom Derby (he
started 33 to 1) has an especial interest for
Australians, as Sir 11. Cuuliffe-Owen’s Spion
Kop colt is a descendant of Carbine on both
sides of the house. The lively pace over the
first six furlongs cracked up the favorites,
Flamingo and Sunny Trace, for when Tot-
tenham Corner was reached they were hang-
ing out distress signals and Fclstead was
going easily. He ran past them both a fur-
long or so from home and won comfortably
by a length and a half from Flamingo (9 to
2) ; Black Watch (33 to 1) was six lengths
away third. Fclstead is trained by Captain
Oswald Bell, son of the late Joshua Peter
Bell, a well-known (Queensland squatter of
the ’eighties. The third'horse. Black Watch,
is owned by a Maorilander, J. B. Reid, and
is the son of a mare bred at the Oakleigh
stud (N.S.W.).
“R. Volt”: Felstead’s time was the same.'
as Call Boy’s last year—2min. 34 z-ssec.
Exactly 2min. 35sec. after the neddies
started a cable operator in Melbourne was
reading off the words which showed that the
stout old Carbine stock had triumphed again.
But when the cable supervisor rushed to the
’phone to get the news to the Argus, “En-
gaged” was the answer. The newspaper was
busy taking down particulars from the Beam.
“Don Crew”: Bookmaker Banger leant
over on his box and buttonholed a passing
urger. “There’s one more ticket for a
tenner to pay, and I ain’t got the cash,” he
whispered hoarsely. “When the bloke comes
to light with the brief, dive on it and go
for your life. Sh! Here he comes now.”
“Ah! Here you are,” he said encouragingly
as the punter arrived. “Got your brief?”
The punter produced a ticket. It went like
a flash, and the urger raced oil in the crowd.
“After him!” screeched Banger. “After
him. He’s stolen this gentleman’s ticket. I’ll
give a tenner to the man that grabs him!”
“Don’t get so upset,” said the punter, pro-
ducing another ticket. “He grabbed the
wrong brief. Here’s the right one!”
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Despite the fact that two uncommonly
good and well-matched «welterweights, one
of them the champion of Australia, were to
supply the main fight, there was only a
small crowd at the Sydney Stadium on
Saturday night, when Victorian Jack Carroll
(10st. 4.’1b.) and Scotland’s Tommy Mclnnes
(lUst. 7Vlb.) shaped up. The faithful were
handsomely rewarded. Carroll is a beauti-
ful example of the boxer-smiter; he can
punch from any position and always hits
hard, while the manner in which he covers
and defends himself from the other fellow’s
blows is a delight to watch. Mclnnes is a
cyclonic man in attack, one who never lets
up, no matter how hard he is punched off.
A sample of his extraordinary toughness was
given in the second round, when he was
sent sprawling on the canvas with a right-
cross to the chin and lay there, apparently
out to the wide. To everybody’s surprise, he
staggered to his feet at nine seconds and
carried on the good work likes the bulldog
he is. Carroll had him pretty bad several
times subsequently, and in the ninth almost
ended the turmoil, but the Scot always came
again, till the champion got sick of punch-
ing so impervious and unreasonable a foe.
In the tenth round Mclnnes seemed to have
lost all sense of direction and simply
sprawled after his tricky opponent. In the
eleventh he hurled himself forward so blindly
and impetuously that lie brought his head
up under the Victorian’s chin with such
force as to drop Carroll to the floor. Referee
Wallis was quick to size up the' situation,
and Carroll was crowned. The graceful Vic-
torian would have won in any event, and
it was a pity that a rousing good fight had
so regrettable an ending.
Bob Miller, the Irish lightweight, died
in the Newcastle Hospital on Monday morn-
ing after a fight with a local lightweight,
one Green. The poor chap appeared to be
winning easily when he collapsed in his
corner; apparently tin* damage was done in
previous fights.
So poorly did George Zarynoff (lost.) and
Martin Ludeckc (12st. 121 b.) entertain spec-
tators at Melbourne Stadium on Saturday
night that, although the said spectators were
out of the building by 9.25, they must have
been relieved to take the air. One. bored
ringsider was heard to inquire where the
money was refunded. Although a winner
by two falls to none George performed like
a novice, and how he managed to defeat Mike
Yokel will remain one of the many unsolved
mysteries of the game. The only thing that
could be said in favor of the pair was their
undoubted earnestness.
Footbrawl
Beautiful weather and the meeting of
Melbourne and Collingwood drew 33,000
taxpayers to Collingwood on Saturday. The
Red Legs marked a shade the better and were
quicker to the ball ; the Magpies stuck it
better and showed more system. But there
was little between them. Early in the last
quarter ’Wood got a 2-goal lead, and though
the others strove forcefully they failed
against the solid Magpie backs and lost
finally by' just I hat—SO points against
’Wood’s 02. Over on the Carlton Oval.
Footscray, which' had just squeezed into the
first four, put up the fight of its life and
consolidated its position 'by downing the
Old Blues on their own dunghill. It was
only by one point, but that spelt victory:
'Seray. 02; Carlton. 01. St, Kilda, playing
like lions one Saturday and the next like
rabbits, simply swamped Geelong, with a
tally of 97 points to the Pivot's 06. Rich-
mond caught South Melbourne in a lack-
adaisical mood and amused itself by piling
up 142 points to South’s 66, Baggott boot-
ing 11 'goals. Essendon outed North Mel-
bourne by 70 points to 59; and Fitzroy
gave Hawthorn the go-by, 106 to 72. With
half the first/ round of, games played the
position is that ’Wood and Melb. lead ; then
follow Richmond. Seray and ’Don ; and Carl-
ton has a possible. The others have already
done in whatever chances they possessed.
(Continued on page 37.)
Karl Schneider, the young cricketer of
Test-match promise, is making a wonderful
fight for life in Adelaide. Since transfusion
of blood, provided by a devoted brother from
Melbourne, he has rallied, and recovery,
which seemed impossible a month ago, is
now talked of.
THE BARRACKER,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Let noise arise; again ’tis Saturday;
The season’s in full swing; the flags are
flown;
Behold the Barracker. in glad array,
Emerging, full of vim, into his own.
lie slouches to the footie grounds, and flaunts
His member's ticket; joins the human
stream;
Lights up a fag and challenges, with taunts,
The crowd at large to back the other team.
The whistle squeals; the gladiators rage ;
The leathern spheroid soars to make a
dive;
The partisans in weird advice engage.
“Bog in,” they yell, and “Eat em all
alive.”
The contest surges at a pace immense;
A willing scrap outside is swiftly curbed;
The quarters pass; excitement is intense;
The peanut boys alone seem unperturbed.
At last it’s o’er; the side that should have
won
(As often is the case) lias come a thud.
Exclaiming that injustice has been done,
The Barracker. departs with threats of
blood,
And vividly portrays, in wordy flow,
The divers pains, the fractures past repair,
The anguish that he'd cause, should Fate
bestow
The (something) umpire to his vengeful
care.
VICTORIA.

O you find difficulty in
starting your car in winter?
Do you find the engine unre-
sponsive and sluggish?
The fault may be a mechanical-
one, but the probability is that
the motor spirit you use is not
sufficiently volatile.
Use Plume. First have the
carburetter adjusted to suit the
more volatile fuel, then fill up
at the Plume pump. You will
find that however cold the
engine there will be no trouble
or delay in starting. You will
find a new pleasure in Winter
motoring, a new appreciation of
engine efficiency, a new stan-

But be sure you use Plume.
Look for the Plume disc on the

The English Rugby Leaguers’ first win
of the tour was gained at the expense of a
second-class N.S.W. XIII. They won by
22 to 9, and AA r ere more than 13 points the
better on the day. With its best team in
the field again, N.S.W, gave them a thorough
trouncing on Saturday. It was 22 to 7 at
the end, and the losers were rather lucky to
be let off so lightly. The best (and cleanest)
player on the White side, Ellaby, Avas helped
off the field in the first half, suffering from
a damaged ankle, and did not appear again,
lie had side-stepped and beaten four Blues,
but the delay that involved gave others a
chance to move up and three tackled him
at once; then lie Avas carried off; Horton
was taken out of the pack and put on
Ellaby’s wing,, but without their leading
attacker the Whites were an easy proposition
throughout the second half, and the Blues
were content merely to hold them. Asa
result the game, which opened Avell, degen-
erated into a dull and ragged exhibition,
relieved only occasionally by a little punch-
ing. A disappointment of the day was Rees,
the Whites’ five-eighth, and altogether the
Englishmen were outclassed; unless their
form improves remarkably their chance of
winning the Test matches is slight. Their
backs, who on the previous Saturday out-
ran the Blues, ivere easily checked by
Busch, Maher, Hardy and Freestone.
Freestone, the hard country Avinger v scored
a lucky try and kicked four goals. Ivadwell,
Avho played another sound game at full-
back, kicked a field goal, and Treweekc (a
great forward), York and Maher crossed
the line. England’s scores came from 2
goals by Sullivan and a try by Fildes. A
crowd of 37,700 paid £3152 to watch the
debacle.

“Richmond Hill”: The proposal of the
Queensland Rugby League that the English
visitors should play a couple of their North
Queensland matches on Sundays drew a pro-
test from the Presbyterian Assembly in
Brisbane. A resolution whs passed regret-
ting that the tourists should “do in Queens-
land what, they would not do in England,”
and a copy of this was sent to the Queens-
land Rugby League. Whether it will move
that body is doubtful, even if the protestants
undertake to take up a collection by way of
compensation. In any chse, Sunday football
has been played in N.Q., especially at Char-
ters Towers, ever since the population mus-
tered thick enough for a couple of sides to
be picked.
* * * *
“Ilalf-forAvard” : CootaiUundra’s enthusiasm
over that draw With the English League (B.
6/6/’2B) was a mere pallid joy compared
with its ecstasies when the “Coota” team
beat Gundagai by 13 to 8 and recaptured the
Maher Cup. About a thousand of its inhabi-
tants poured back to the township in trains
from which Avild sounds of victory issued, and
long lines of motor-cars helped the riot of
joyful noise. The Cootamundran who went
to bed sober that night is likely to be re-
garded for ever as lacking in civic pride.
Among the hectic events of the evening Avas
the filling of the treasured bauble with bank-
notes for division among the players. A dozen
toAvns, including the defeated Gundagai and
the old rival, Temora, have demanded
matches; and hot mention has been made of
the vast wealth held in reserve to back the
opinion that “Coota's” victory was a fluke.
That is the usual course of events in this
weird annual eruption.

The All Blacks beat Griqualand West in
the third match of their S’African tour, but
went under again on Saturday, Transvaal
defeating them by 6 to nil. They can
scarcely be at their top yet, but obviously
Afrikander form is better than was thought
in Maoriland and Australia.
“Kaihiku”: Jock McGregor, the Thames
and Auckland footballer of 30 years ago.
is now a resident of Durban, and was doubt-
less on the wharf to join in the welcome to
the All Blacks. Jock served with Brabant’s
Horse during the Boer War, and the year
following peace he captained the Pretoria
New Zealanders, who were runners-up in
the Transvaal Rugby Union Cup competi-
tion. There were sothc fine players in that
team, notably Merle Bonnar, a West Coast
and Wellington rep. He played his fi“al
Test on Gallipoli. Others were Don Mc-
Tavish and Tom Baker, the speedy Napier
three-quarter.
The Rugby Union staged another thrilling
club match in Sydney on Saturday, and
10,000 spectators were on hand to see it,
but, unfortunately for the Union, the
majority saw it for nothing. Y.M.C.A. beat
Randwick by 23 to 16, and now has a good
lead for the premiership. CerUtti, for the
Young Men, and Westfield, for Randwick,
were the outstanding players.
* * * *
“Gate”: With four codes of football —
Rugby League. Union, Australian and
Soccer — Uoav bidding for public support,
Brisbane seems to be suffering from an em-
barrassment of riches in the way of leather-
booting. The Australian-rulers are particu-
larly keen on winning back the favor of the
Queenslanders, for, up till the early ;1880’s,
no other game was played in the northern
State. It’s a fact which might be recalled
with profit by those Melbourne League
gentlemen who think no harm can come to
their code so long as their particular clubs
draw tremendous “gates.” That Queens-
landers hare not lost the art of playing
Australian football was shown in the tAvo
exciting ip ter-State matches in Brisbane,
N. S. Wales won the first, 46-43, after Mc-
Cormack’s State had begun the last quarter
Avith a lead of six points, but in the return
game the Queenslandei’s played all over the
youths from Sydney, winning 67-57.
“Let Go”: “Subiaco’s” “record” score of
43 goals 20 behinds (278 points) in the
Australian game of football was eclipsed by
a team of Victorian Diggers playing against
Q’land camp-mates in Cairo. The scorers
retired for drinks after the Vic. full-back
had kicked his third goal. That Avas in the
third quarter, and the goal tally had reached
60. every man in the team having put it
through.' I played for Q’land and touched
the ball once.
Racquet and Bawl
“Game and Set”: Hawkes’s defeat of
Brugnon in the French hard-courts cham-
pionship was a distinctly creditable achieve-
ment, and the young man from Geelong
played well against Lacoste, though beaten
in straight sets (6-2, 6-4, 6-4). Henri
THE HOPELESS CASE.
ELDER BROTHER: " I’ve taught yer every think I know about the game, an’ yer stand
there like a big melon and know no think!”
Cochet was the hero of the tournament, for
lie beat Lacoste 6-3, 6-1, 6-3, after losing
the first set 5-7, having already captured
the mixed doubles with Eileen Bennett, the
new English star, as a partner. Eileen has
eclipsed Betty Nuthall, and her pretty style
is praised on all hands, but she proved no
match for Helen Wills in the final of the
women’s singles; the American girl made it
6-1, 6-2.
“15-30”: Cochet must now be accounted
the toughest and finest fighter in inter-
national tennis. His achievement with the
little-known De Buzelet against Patterson
and Hawkes revealed his indomitable spirit
at its highest. With a lead of tAvo sets to
love and the board reading 3-1 and 30-love
on Patterson’s service in the third term, the
Australians seemed to have it all their
own way; yet Cochet pulled the match out
of the soup. Last year at Wimbledon he
won the singles after Huhtcr, Tilden and
Borotra in turn had grabbed the first two
sets and pushed him hard in the third.
Tilden’s tally showed 6-2, 6-4, 5-1 before
the Gaul took hold and wrenched the match
out of the tall American’s hands.
;!j ;•{ '!•
Moon and Cummings have started well in
England by figuring in the final of the Gipsy
Hill tournament singles. Cummings de-
feated his partner 6-3, 6-3; the Queenslander
had trounced Fyzee, who has represented
India in Davis Cup contests. In the
doubles Moon and Cummings lost to Hawkes
and Fisher, but Moon and Miss Akliurst van-
quished Godfrec and Miss Ryan in the mixed
doubles—a capital performance. Miss Ryau
proved too good for Miss Boyd in the
women's singles, and the American and Mrs.
f.ycett scored over Miss Akhurst and Miss
Boyd in the doubles.
Ilopman has apparently struck form at
last ; the slim youth and-Crawford fought
out the final of the northern championship,
so-called, and Ilopman beat his partner 4-b,
13-11, 6-2. It is announced that Moon,
Crawford, Ilopman and Cummings are to
play a match with a British team. Inciden-
tally, Britain is travelling well in the Davis
Cup competition; it is about to meet Italy in
one of the European semi-finals.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Grafton” : How is this for an educational
achievement? “Wally” Giles, the N.S.W.
North Coast professional, gave lessons in
the one day to an old chap and his wife,
their son and daughter-in-law and their son.
“Manuka”: Oatlands (Tas.) can boast of
at least one unique record in Australian golf-
ing circles. Not only are “Colonel Damu-
rize’s” sentiments about women playing on
Sundays upheld on the local, links, but no
play is permitted on the Sabbath. The links
are owned by a gentleman with religious
leanings.
* * il* Z
“lan C.” : Apropos of the crow at Can-
berra collaring the golf balls of Billy
Hughes and Markets Minister Paterson, a
story is told by a Melb. lawyer, formerly
prominent in municipal affairs, of how a
Scottish dame who lived alongside a links
found impounding of the tiny spheres) profit-
able. During the Great War the lady
called a few times on legal business, and
the man of law mentioned on one occasion
that golf balls were worth so much each.
When Mrs. Caledonia came in to settle she
handed over cash for the bulk of the bill
and a bagful of golf balls for the balance.
She said that the lawyer had fixed the price
for the wee bits o’ rubber, and he couldna’
go back on his word. Asked whether she
was in lawful possession of the balls, she
said she was just as much entitled to them
as to rain; they had fallen into her garden.
The lawyer accepted the payment in kind
without prejudice.
* * * *
“Hoylake”: Lord Hawke has been advis-
ing the younger generation to leave the
regular pursuit of golf till later in life, and
in the meantime to concentrate on cricket
and football, “two games which are assets
of British life and have made the British
great sportsmen.” He added, with truth,
that cricket and football create an unex-
ampled esprit de corps, while golf is an
essentially individual sport, and lamented the
fact that golf has absorbed many a poten-
tial All England cricketer. Ills Ludship over-
looks the fact that big cricket is now so
organised that only the man of independent
means or the professional and the veiled pro-
fessional can afford to take part in it. The
youngster with liis living to earn cannot
afford six days a week in county cricket.
But since he must have relaxation he turns
to golf. To the footballer also the call of
golf is irresistible once lie goes on the
football shelf.
:!: * * *
“Brassey”: Moore Park (N.S.W:) is so
often held up to admiration as a model of
what a municipal golf links should be, that
it is a mild surprise to find anyone com-
plaining of its condition. Everyone knew,
of course, that it was horribly congested,
and that the law forbidding players to carry
shotguns for the benefit of the myriad ball-
stealing kids was a bitterly unjust one. But
the first was rightly blamed on the municipal
parsimony that expected one course to fill
the needs of Sydney with its population of
a million, while the inane prejudices of
lawmakers who knew nothing of the sorrows
of golf accounted for the second. Of late,
however, the fairways themselves have been
allowed to get into such a hirsute condi-
tion that players find they have a better
chance of finding their ball before nightfall
if they play through the rough in prefer-
ence to the fairway. It is alleged that the
economy programme of the Civic Commis-
sion is to blame. In the good old days of
the aldermen it was easy to find jobs for
hard-up supporters cutting the grass on the
fairways with shears or a pair of nail scis-
sors, with the result that they were kept
clear. This custom has been abolished, and
the ground staff is expected to keep the
links in order, an almost impossible job in
view of the copious rains of the last few
months.
❖ ik
“Mid Iron” : The golf mania seems to be
spreading in Britain, where one would have
thought that the game had fairly reached
saturation point. None of the great Lon-
don department stores is now complete with-
out its miniature golf links, real turf being
laid down, and a staff of professional
coaches employed to lure neophytes to at-
tempt the game and depart, infected, after
buying more than a sufficiency of clubs
which most of them will never be able to
utilise effectively. Sydney and Melbourne
emporiums had a nibble at the same idea a
year or two ago, but the idea seems to
have petered out.
4* ❖ ❖
“Callan Park” : Interest has been aroused
in Austrhliau golfing circles by a cabled
statement that the governing authorities of
Texas have resolved to install golf-links at
all the State’s hospitals for the insane. The
theory is that golf will enable the patients
to concentrate and so recover their lost
mental balance. It is the first weak spot in
one full of holes. If the average golfer who
passes among his fellows as sane were able
to achieve that trick of concentration, half
the world of golfers would be plus-men—the
present percentage of these is about .100079
recurrent. If anyone doubts this, let him
study the pitiable efforts at concentration
on the game, and the game alone, to be
observed on every golf course in creation at
week-ends. The ideal golfer does not pause
to consider whether his caddie is bowlegged
or afflicted with a perennial cold in the head,
or whether the associate member who went
on before him in the mixed foursome hasn’t
rather intriguing legs. He concentrates on
the ball, the shot, the. game and his card, and
that is why he succeeds, the most important
factor in that quartette being left to the
reader’s imagination. To the other variety
of golfer—and lie is as numerous, compared
with the ideal player, as the sands of the
sea—concentration is out of the question.
Yet, in spite of the want of that faculty, he
roams in considerable herds outside the walls
of asylums, and even his best friends are not
so heartless as to suggest that he would be
better inside taking a course in concentration.

“Goongarrie”: Lake Perkolilli (W.A.) has
been the scene of many motor-races for
State titles and more or less successful
attempts on records, and a 50-miles Aus-
tralian championship has been arranged to
take place there at the end of August. A
cup valued at 100 guineas and the lion’s
share of 100 guineas in casli will reward
the winner. Eastern motorists meditating
making the journey may reckon on having
a good time, as well as witnessing or taking
part in exciting races—there are to be other
events, of course—on a remarkable natural
speedway. KalgoOrlic is a hospitable place,
and the goldfields spring is a delight, especi-
ally if it happens to be a good season for
wildflowers. And there are the Kalgoorlie
and Boulder Cup meetings for punters—
if motorists ever punt.

“Garry”: Daytona Beach (U.S.A.) may
not be the world’s finest straight-away course
for motor speeding, though Segrave, Camp-
bell and Keech made their records there.
Campbell, who, by the way, got his first
experience of motoring on a 2-h.p. Rex
motor-cycle, reckons that finer sands can be
found in Denmark. He is going to have
another try with his Napier Lion-engined
Bluebird, and the Alvis co. at Coventry has
chartered him to steer a 500-h.p. front-
wheel-drive monster now in course of con-
struction. The Isotta-Frascliini people,
makers of the world’s highest-powered tour-
ing and enclosed cars, have also given him a
retainer. They have now under bench tests
a new 18-cylinder engine, arranged in three
banks over a single shaft, which weighs
8001 b. and develops 1500 h.p. at 2000 revs.
The Bluebird’s; Napier Lion engine weighs
8751 b. and develops 895 h.p. at 3000 revs.
Segrave’,s pair of Sunbeam engines,
developing 500 li.p. each, were much heavier
in the aggregate than either the Napier or
Isotta-Fraspliini, and Iveech’s three-engined
1500-h.p. outfit was the heaviest of the lot.
lint there seems to be a strong element of
safety in great weight. Poor Lockhart, who
got a, great turn of speed out of the com-
paratively light-engined Stutz, couldn’t hold
the course and was killed.

“Cut-out”: Maorilander Jack Arnott has
made a great impression on Queensland fol-
lowers of motor-cycling. One of his achieve-
ments at Deagon was to ride a mile in
48 l-ssec., which is claimed to be an Aus-
tralian record for a mile on a grass track
for motor-cycles 350 c.c. and under. Arnott’s
machine was an A.J.S.-Jap, 2J h.p.

“0.H.V.”: Dirt-track motor-cycle racing,
which is having a good spin at London’s
Crystal Palace, seems to be a more enduring
sort of sport than the concrete-track variety,
ft was introduced in Australia and Maori-
hand shortly after motor-propelled two-
wheelers were invented, and it still holds
its own, though the builders of expensive
and scientifically-constructed concrete tracks
such as that at Maroubra (Sydney) bewail
heavy losses. Even London’s famous Brook-
lands track gets the bulk of its revenue now-
adays from car-manufacturers who test their
wares there. It isn’t because a dirt track,
I aken by and large, is safer than a concrete
one. The possibilities of accident are more
numerous than on a concrete service, although
the speed isn’t so great. In America, where
dirt-track racing is immensely popular, thev
have already barred the entrance of 1000
c.c. twins in such events, and the feeling
amongst the leaders of the sport is that,
sooner or later, 250 c.c. will have to be made
the limit. When it is considered that it is
possible to get 90 m.p.h. x or more out of a
modern 250-c.c. machine, and that a rider
carries his life in his hands when he exceeds
70 m.p.h. on a dirt track, there seems plenty
of reason for the limitation.

“Pedlar : The French seem to have taken
Hubert Opperman to their hearts. Says
one paper: “He. arrived knowing nothing
about our French track methods, fashion of
living, climate or food, yet after two months
he equals France’s best. Marvellous!” An-
other journal predicts “definite leadership”
for “this man from Australia, that happy
country where cobbled roads are unknown,”
the highways being perfect, as all motorists,
motor-cyclists and bikists can testify. It
also transpires that the friendly ‘Frogs
already call Hubert “Oppy.” That' is proof
positive that he has made a hit.
Miscellaneous
’B-Gar” : “Talkin’ o' tin ’ares,” said Slimy
Bob, 'I went inter the reel game wunst —
coursin’ in the open. Me an’ Bluey 'ere
bought a dog. an’ reckoned w y e’d get a rise
be enterin’ ’im in the Colac Cup. We
scrapes up a tenner an’ took a long price
about Eager, as we calls ’im. They slips
Eager an’ another dog up near a nettin’
fence, an’ close ter where some ewes an’
lambs is feedin’. But they’d on’y started
a jiff w’en Eager reckoned ’e'd sooner ’ave
fresh mutton than jugged ’are, so ’e ’ops tlm
fence an’ kills a coupler ewes an’ five lambs.”
■‘Don’ I remember it!” interposed Bluey.
"An’ they charged a pound a pop fer them

“Koolonga” : The disparaging remarks of
“Dingus” on present-day oarsmen (B.
•’lO/5/'2B) move me to suggest that either
his memory is failing him or his old-time
paragons were all gentlemen of means.' The
programme he has drawn up as typical would
allow very little time for the athlete to put
in an appearance at office, school or work-
shop. Even schoolboy oars of to-day are
not permitted to break their studies in favor
of the river, and there are very few men in
the rowing game who do not depend on their
brains or hands for a living. Present-day
training is really thorough, for oarsmen apply
the science of physical health to all their
daily routine —a method that used to be
sneered at.
“Healesville”: I asked a Swan River man
the reason for his State’s pronounced superi-
ority in rowing. “Training,” lie said, “if
you can put it in one word. We take
our preparation seriously, and that is not
always the case with States which, consider-
ing their greater reserves and better facilities,
ought to beat us five times out of six. In
Victoria especially you will see oarsmen who
would be all the better for steady road
work drive up to the boatshed in motor-
cars and drive away when they have done
their spin. Training' on cigarettes and jazz
is also allowed in other parts of the Com-
monwealth, but not in our division.” If
this isn’t the explanation, what is?
* * * #
“Ride Off”: Colonel T. I’. Melvill, man-
ager of the Indian Army polo team now in
Sydney, is a prominent figure in the polo
world. He went to America in 1924 as No. 1
for the British team, which was beaten at
Meadowbank by America by 14 goals to 5,
and has played there with other teams.
Captain Wordsworth has been accounted one
of the finest backs in Indian polo, and the
others are all young players of great pro-
mise. The response to the request for the
loan of ponies for the use of the visitors was
good, and although the team will be at some
disadvantage in this respect the Dudley Cup
tournament, which begins at Kensington on
the last day of the month, should be a
memorable event.'

“Salambo”: The latest electrical gadget
for athletes is an electric pacing machine
for swimmers, invented by two Aucklanders.
It consists of a belt running over two pul-
leys, one at each end of the bath, carrying
a white and red flag visible to the swimmer.
It is electrically driven at a given speed,
from times recorded by Weissmuller down to
those possible for a beginner, these being
altered as required. Its object is to train
swimmers to acquire judgment of pace. No
mention is made of the machine’s capacity
for teaching people who write about swim-
ming that same thing, though if it could be
adapted to that end it would fill a long-felt
want in some journals devoted to the glori-
fication of immature flappers.
A. McWHINNEY, hon. sec. of the N.S.W.
Nat. Football League, which plays the

"Dimon”: A corn-husking competition
at a recent Richmond (N.S.W.) show was
won for the second year in succession by
Alf Bushel], who undressed 100 cobs in 41
minutes. At one time these contests
were popular at many country shows, and
the slickest huskers were talked about in
all the barns on the mid-eastern rivers
where maize was the chief crop. Con-
sequently, when a few of the champions
competed at the show, each with a pile
of cobs on the ground in front of him, there
was an interested swarm of farmers around
them, and a good deal of wagering on the
result. When the contest was over there
was a rush for the husks, for bedding and
cow feed, and the cobs of grain, which fed
the prize pigs.

"Eaglet”: Can anyone name a town in
Australia to beat Cessnock (N.S.W.) for
sport? It boasts five racecourses racing
under A.R.C. rules and one owning allegi-
ance to the A.J.0.; in addition, there are
numerous bridle-racing fixtures under any old
rules. Tin-hare meetings are held weekly,
and there is a plumpton where the dogs can
chase the live puss. There is a stadium for
boxing; most of the pubs run a wood-chop

or a quoit tournament every pay; the first-
grade Soccer team is famous, while there
are numerous clubs of lower grades; cycling
has its professional and amateur clubs, and
the golf links are good. The population (re-
markable for sobriety) hovers about the
20,000 mark.

“M.G.S.”: That Melbourne uproar over
the smoking-out of a fox (B. 6/6/’2B)
seems to me to be beside the point. The fox
is vermin which inflicts untold suffering on
sheep and birds, and its stamping-out is a
meritorious act. But the spectacle of 150
men and women in fancy dress assembling
to do the deed is rather ridiculous. Hunting
originated in the quest for food, so there
should be nothing to complain of if, in future,
successful hunters ate their fox.
* * * #
“Quirindi”: “Bramall Lane” (B. 23/5/’2B)
is a bit at sea over the age that a man
has to reach before he can be appointed to
the Marylebone C. C. committee. Consider
the ages of certain committeemen in 1925:
F. 11. Hollins, 48 ; F. T. Mann, 37; H. D.
Swan, 40; T. O. Jameson, 33; M. Falcon,
37; A. E. R. Gilligan, 31. “Bramall Lane”
is probably unaware that four members of
committee retire yearly and are not eligible
for re-election at that time.
* * * *
“J.H.” (Lond.) : “Plum” Warner had to
refuse that invitation to act on the English
selection committee this year. His contract
to write cricket notes for the Morning Post
was too valuable to give up. Governing
bodies in sport are making the lot (of
the sporting celebrity turned journalist a
pretty hard one. It is an open secret that
Wakefield, still a great forward, was passed
over by the R.U. selectors this year because
he contributed Rugby articles to the Even-
ing News. Now the Jockey Club has
“warned” leading trainers who supplement
their incomes by writing for the press. The
ban wall not affect Lambton, Lord
Derby’s relation, who gets £2OO a week from
the Evening News throughout the flat-racing
season, as he has retired from training- but
it will affect W. V. Beatty, Earl Beatty’s
brother, w r ho writes for the Evening
Standard.

"C. Bumpkin”; Jaunts per lighter-than-
air dirigibles may yet be more attractive to
careful citizens than aeroplaning. The
Goodyear Co. put on the market some time
ago a baby Zep. capable of short cruises
with two or three passengers. It proved
so popular that the firm has followed with
a more serious contribution 128 feet long
and able to travel 350 miles, at 46 m.p.h.
with a crew of four. The new model has
two motors, one of which will keep the
lielium-filled sausage in the atmosphere.

“M.L.C”: “E.S.S.” says (B. 16/5/’2B)
that a coat made of Tasmanian black
opossum skins should realise 500 guineas in
London. I have a black opossum rug in
London, made of 40 picked and particularly
fine Tas. skins. It should be worth twice as
much as a coat, but if “E.S.S.” can tell me
how I can sell it for a quarter of the price he
mentions I shall be grateful.

“G.Q.”: The vertical city will shortly
arrive in Melbourne. It will consist of a
ground floor for the entry and exit of cars,
with parking accommodation for 60; a caba-
ret next above for feeding purposes; then
tiers of 45 shops, culminating in a roof
garden. Thus the petrolitizen will be able
to eat, buy anything shef wants and recreate
herself in perfect comfort, even on the wet-
test day. The corner of Russell and Little
Bourke streets will be the location.

“Keg" : At least one man is satisfied with
the tram-’bus situation in Sydney streets. He
is employed as a ticket-inspector on ’buses,
and for services duly rendered has a pass
on the trams. He boards a tram going south
till he spots a ’bus going north, gets off,
examines tickets, and repeats the process
throughout his shift.

“El V.”: Wine, brandy and bottled beer
by no means exhaust the list of Australian
drinks you can buy abroad. In Persia and
further India the limejuice you get is
generally labelled “Made in Australia.” This
time last year I was enjoying part of a
stock which I picked up as far afield as
Kirman. Now Sir Arbuthnot Lane and
other people have started a craze in London
for Australian granadilla cocktails. Pub-
lished recipes insist that Australian fruit
must be used, and the.taste for the tipple is
spreading rapidly.

“Magnetic Is.”: “The Bat” (B. 23/5/’2B)
wants to know why cement companies do not
use casks. With competition so keen the
expense would be too great. The latest
bag is made from four thicknesses of brown
paper. In a recent shipment of 1344 bags
from Sydney to Townsville the out-turn was
20 bags slightly torn and a loss of liewt.
from the total shipment. Paper bags, if
handled with reasonable care, arc superior
to hessian—they give off less dust. An
ideal container would be a bag made from
cheaper-qualit.y hessian than the article now
in use, and lined with paper.

“Eromeno”: “Wai Dong, the Dinkum
Tailor,” is a sign displayed by a North-
Queensland Chinese. And I copied the fol-
lowing notice in a north-west township—
it was typewritten and pasted on an Italian
storekeeper’s window: —
YOU MUST BY CAR.
We agents solely far Hipp Chevs Buickes Over-
land Rugbys & ever other sort of car you want
any time. We sell you any time all qantytys
motorcar parts for spairs and the acessories very ceap

“Diogenes”: “R.O’H.,” writing of the
Bay steamers (B. 16/5/’2B) says a pas-
senger at £4O takes up 320 cubic feet,
and thus displaces 40 tons of cargo, which
would bring in £l2O. It is always reckoned
that 40 cubic feet are equal to one ton,
therefore a passenger would merely displace
eight tons of cargo, equal to £24. Of course,
there is a difference between such articles as
pig iron and feather beds, but both these
lines would require special rates of freight
and special stowage. Anyhow, if all the
deck cabins were filled with cargo the ship
would capsize and sink in the first gale.

“Herodot” : That the tree known as Doug-
las spruce or American red fir, one of the
most valuable softwoods of the United
States, will flourish in Australia is shown
by several at Walhalla (Vic.), where they
were planted years ago. The biggest is a
trifle over 100 feet in height, with a dia-
meter of just on, 3ft. at the ground, decreas-
ing very slowly, for the trunk is as straight
and as smooth as me mast of a ship.
The tree attains to a much greater height
in its native habitat, but only when it is
growing at an altitude of 5000 ft. or more.
It should be an excellent timber to culti-
vate in this country.
* * * *
“Garbut”: I posted a 31b. parcel to a
friend five miles away, and because the State
border happens to be between us I paid Is.
Bd. postage; yet the same parcel would have
gone to Cloncurry, 1500 miles away, for Is.
Providing I stick to Queensland, I can send
a telegram 15 miles for 9d., or 1500 miles
for Is., but it costs Is. 4d. to reach my
five-mile-away friend by wire, the same as to
Perth, 5000 miles distant. The Postal De-
partment is under Federal control, so why
should this imaginary line we call the border
have such a bearing on postal and telegraph
rates ?

CHAMOLSETTE
GLOVES
In the clear cold sunshine of Sunday
afternoon Kingsford Smith and Charlie Ulm
alighted at Mascot aerodrome, having joined
the growing list of Australians who keep
on making the impossible seem the easiest
thing in the world. Right on time the
enormous and awe-inspiring bird, trailing
the miles of space it has cleaved like a sky-
blue banner to the glory of Australia, came
to earth amid the roars from a hundred-
thousand throats. In spite of the winter-
chilled earth, the crowds that waited to
cheer the fliers were greater than those
which a month or two ago greeted Lone-
hand Hinkler as he stepped from his baby
’plane.
For more than a week the excitement over
this latest air victory had been steadily
mounting, and the result was an audience
made up of whole families from every suburb
within motoring, driving or walking distance
of the aerodrome. Long before three every
inch of parking room, every foothold of
earth was as freighted with humans as a
hive with bees. Nor were the tense —almost
emotional—crowds at Mascot the only
watchers. From tops of ladders in back
yards, from roofs of garages, from balconies
around the harbor-front the Southern Cross
was cheered and cheered to its landing.
This was a spectacular affair, the ’plane
approaching and retiring and circling in the
air like a skittish steed of the four winds.
Perhaps it was shying at the race of troglo-
dytes who peered at it from the squelchy
swamp of Mascot. But finally the airmen
landed and Avere duly hugged, Kingsford
Smith by his parents, Charlie .TTlm by his
wife. The two Americans, Warner and
Lyon, modestly tried to efface themselves,
but Avere foiled by the floppy panama that
Radio-man Warner had Avorn to greet the
blazing sun of Sydney.
Chief Civic Commissioner Fleming, Avitli
his manly, direct speech of welcome; Hugh
Denison, in impeccable spats ; Keith Smith,
with a slim Avaist, dark-brown tailorings and
seal-black hair; Shearer, Avith his cheery
grin; Kingsford Smith, his fair skin weatlier-
stung; Charlie Ulm, broad shouldered as a
heavyweight-champion; Navigator Lyon,
whose speech, drawling, humorous and slur-
ring consonants, sounded exactly like a new
Black Crow record —these Avere the high
lights of the civic reception to the airmen
at the Town Hall on Monday. Young Mrs.
Ulm, who never took her eyes from her
husband, and radio wizard Warner, who
in reply to this Letter’s congratulations
said “Thank you, Ma’am,” in the most dis-
arming Southern Avay, Avere also prominent
among the offerings to the flashlight photo-
graph. There Avere speeches on behalf of
the Commonwealth, the State and the Par-
liamentary Labor Party—unending hashes of
one another. But outstanding was the really
fervent “Thank God” uttered by each speaker
for the safe home-coming. This Letter has
never heard the Deity thanked so often at
official functions before.
On the hurried Avay out to the lift, Kings-
ford Smith was bombarded by the girls of
the Town Hall staff-well, he couldn’t kiss
them all, but perhaps there’ll be a better
chance next time.
Even the cold stillness of June cannot
keep the fervent punter from Randwick.
The A.J.C. meeting, ticketed with the Royal
birthday, brought top-coated thousands to
Paddock, Leger and Fat. The official stand
was like .an enormous fujrriers’ display.
Every sort and condition of pelt was in
evidence, but this Letter sighted two only of
the calfskin coats which were to be so fashion-
able. The leather and suede coat, too, were
unanimously absent. The G.-G. Stonehavens
brought a party on Saturday to show their
guests. Captain and Lady Mary Herbert
and Colonel T. P. Melville, an Australian
race meeting. The Priminister Bruce couple
Avere others of the mighty; and Morna Mae-
Cormick, very sonsy in brown furs and
broadcloth, and Helen Stephen, very trig in
sapphire-blue velour collared in chinchilla,
were notable among the young of society’s
av i n ter-cocooned.
Sydney was very glad that George V.
had inscribed Miss Eadith Walker’s name
on his tablets for a birthday honor. For
the future the great-hearted Mistress of
Yaralla will be known, by the King’s de-
cree, as Dame Eadith. But no title can
make her more admired. Her gifts to (he
war-sick soldier, through the Red Cross,
are unending; and that is only one of a
hundred channels through which she makes
her inherited wealth anoint the world’s
wounds. Clifford Hay, too, good friend of
all Sydney press-women, can now sport a
C.B.E. But it is not exactly for liis kindly
offices to women writers that his Majesty
sent out the glittering bauble. As Under-
secretary of the Premier’s department it
has fallen to Mr. Hay’s lot to organise the
arrangements for the visits of the Prince of
Wales, the British Squadron, the American
Fleet and, lastly, the Duke and Duchess. An
0.8. E. falls to pleasant-faced Mrs. Wil-
kinson as the reward of her work at the
canteens at Circular Quay for the visiting
Jack Tar and his American sailor-brother.
Maude Royden flashed all her fagets
during the just-gone week. She preached
from the pulpit and lectured from the Town
Hall platform. She was the guest at in-
numerable parties, not the least being the
one at Manning House, where women ’grads
and undergrads, gave her a great welcome.
The tea-drinking at the Y.W.C.A. drew hun-
dreds who could not get a close-up without
paying real money. For this last Miss
Royden’s dressing was a 1 gavotte in black
and gold. Miss Ghave Collison, her special
herald, wore a new brand of millinery; and
Mrs. Albert Littlejohn’s attire added to the
clothes interest. A boomerang of flowers
and an illuminated scroll in a soft blue
leather cover were presented by the Y.W.C.A.
president. Miss Fowler.
The Royal Commission into Town Hall
graft has revealed one thing to Sydney’s
womankind, and that is the gossiping pro-
pensity of the male. Before the amazing
mountain of chit-chat, of Doc told me and
Roe told him, and Roll Ra Me Fah told Roe,
a woman’s brain fairly reels. Many a wife
is now beginning to realise how most of the
day is consumed by her particular Napoleon
of Finance. What with chat on the tele-
phone, chat in the office and chat on the
Rialto, no wonder the poor dear’s nerves
can’t stand a half-hour of home chat!
How far the Wentworth of Church Hill
is from Cocos Island, where the guns of the
Sydney spoke to the Emden ! And what a long
time ago it all was, and did it really happen
or is it only history? as a small girl asked.
It seemed real enough when part of the
picture of the sinking of the German war-
boat: was screened at the King’s Birthday
dinner-dance. At least one onlooker had a
stabbing memory of an awakening in the
cold blackness of a winter dawn to the
sound of a band playing leaf-brown troops
on board a transport in Woolloomooloo Bay.
What visions of war stirred behind the other
human masks were hidden, but the applause
ripped the atmosphere like a summer storm.
Then up went the lights, bunting blazed, out
blared the jazz and the peaceful present was
full of new dances and old sea chanties.
The dance w T as the yearly affair to benefit
the Navy League. Neither Chief Justice
Street’s lady, who was president, nor Shirley
Bavin, the secretary, could be present, but
Commander Leo Quick’s wife, wdio was trea-
surer, w T as a very effective head in georg-
ettes the green of a curling wave. She
and her sailor husband entertained a quar-
ter-deck party that included the Colonel Old-
ings. The Commander Hixsons were among
the night’s hosts, and the Kelso King family,
the Stephen Herfords, the C. G. Berges and
Commander Garcia.
Here’s a remarkable woman—a bride who
could completely sink her own personal claims
in favor of a vaulting ambition for her brand-
new husband. She is Mrs. Charlie Ulm, and
her marriage
was not a
week old be-
fore her air-
man spoke to
her of the in-
tended flight
with Kings-
ford Smith. A
week later he
had sailed for
America. Since
then it has
been- eleven
months of
anxious wait-
ing, with many
sleepless
nights, for the
girl who, be-
fore she was
the wife of a
hero, was
Mary Calla-
ghan, of Ballina. May Moore made this
picture, and it is typical of Mrs. Ulm that,
although the studio appointment was made
for Friday, she went to May Moore on
Thursday, saying, “Will you take me to-day?
You know, the Southern Cross is flying to
Brisbane to-night, and I won’t have any
sleep, and then I couldn't make The Bul-
letin a good picture, could 1 ?”
The debs, had a night-out at the Palais
last week when the Masonic brethren of
the Scottish Royal Arch hold their ninth
yearly dance. No less than 50 pretty
younsters were let loose to annex their share
of the dancing partners of Sydney. On
the way to their presentation to Chief
Justice Street and his lady, they passed
under an archway of roses and twining
palm and fern held by the Companions of
the Order in full plumage. The effect w y as
quite springlike and drew an ooli of appre-
ciation from one and all, as Grandma
(no, this Letter doesn't mean the S. M.
Herald) would have written it. Mrs.
Lewis Packer, resplendent with the gold and
reds of an Out West sunset on black georg-
ette background, made the introductions
which enabled budding youth and the law’s
anointed to exchange a smile. The Chief
Justice’s wife wore for the spectacular
occasion a gold-lace frock flashing with
sequined panels. Other head-liners were
the Attorney-General Boyces, tile American
Consular Lawtons —nhe sporting an opal
pendant of great beauty—Grand Superin-
tendent Dyson Austen and Mrs. Dyson
Austen, whose handsome raiment was black
in hue and heavy with bead embroideries.
Australia, give three cheers for Mrs,
Kingsford Smith, mother of the man whose
brilliant piloting has proved that the Pacific
can be con-
quered by the
human flier!
Mr s. Smith,
though 71, has
felt like a
girl of 17
since the news
came of the
Sou them
Cross’s land-
ing at Suva.
She and her
husband, the
latter young at
76, live at
Longueville ;
and the proud
mother, though
she d oe s n’t
often come into
town, gave
May Moore a
sitting on Fri-
day for this
photograph.
“Blue eyes and an Art Gallery wedding
di’ess” was a girl-chum’s description of
Patricia Watt as a bride. Andy Watt, K.C.,
is beginning to run short of eligible daugh-
ters. Only two of the quiverful remain, and
one of them’s engaged and the other’s at
school. The second bride from the home this
year walked up the aisle of St. Martha’s
under the eyes of half Stratlifield, for the
Watt girls are recognised belles of that vil-
lage. The wedding frock was beauteous and
bounteous (the skirt measured over eight
yards around the liem) and started in a
square-throated, tight-fitting bodice, like
Mariana’s or Guinevere’s, and rippled and
swelled its mediaeval way to below the ankles.
Inset the whole length of the front was a
panel sewn thick with bossy pearl and gold
thread. The bodice was finished at the back
with a large bow, whose ends flip-flopped into
a pearly mermaid train. A Limerick lace
veil, proud of. its years, the usual orange
blossom and an armful of orchids and lily
of the valley were other bright points of the
outfit. Father Kerwick tied the knot, Dr.
Eric Mortley Fisher, of Ashfield, bridc-
grdomed, and Joan and Meg Watt ’maided
in petalled frocks of almond-pink and winter
sky-blue velvets. Dr. Bertie Schlink best-
manned. At the reception Mrs. Watt
toned in with the flower scheme; and
—most wonderful thing of all—the speeches
at the supper table were next-door to
brilliant.
Pretty Lesly Johnson, of Double Bay, flut-
tering ivory chiffon s and layers of tulle, pink
in the train arid mist-like in the veil, walked
the plank at All Saints’, Woollahra, and
emerged from her plunge Mrs. Osborne Wil-
kinson, of Rose Bay. Choir-boys sang their
sweetest, the church was heady with flowers
arranged by the bride's chums, Canon Lang-
ley officiated with due ceremony, and the
young doctor-bridegroom was encouraged by
Geoffrey Phippard during the agonising wait
while his bride and her ’maids drew near.
Audrey Johnson and Kathleen Wilkinson
brought soft pink lace frocks and small hats
with soft pink wings to the procession. The
Rose Bay Golf Club listened to the con-
gratulations. Here Mrs. W. Iv. Johnson,
in blue georgettes starred with diamente and
enfolded in a black velvet cloak, did the
honors in company with her husband.
One well-known young man in Sydney has
been an anxious reader of the strike news;
and his feelings nearly boiled over when
word came through that next the Loongana
would be held up. The anxious young man
is Jack Gregory, booked for matrimony with-
in the next few days, hut still separated by
the width of Bass Strait from his bride.
When the deed is done and they return to
Sydney they will set up housekeeping at
Randwick.
The week's bride at Hunter's Hill was
Elsie Bevan, a daughter of lovable old
Judge Bevan —though until he had to retire
the other day he had probably never once
thought of himself as old. The ’groom was
Robert C. Cox, of Lindfield, and the twain
were made one at All Saints'. The Town
Hall at the same aloof settlement echoed
the toasts.
A last-week pretty bride from Temora,
Maisie Selbie, chose St. Paul’s, in Cliats-
wood, for her wedding. The ’groom was
Ronald Martin, of Dungog.
Pretty Glory Bohrsmau, a great worker
in the interests of the Sydney Hospital, is
viewing matrimony by the light reflected
from her new engagement ring. The giver
is John Wallis, only son of the J. B. Wal-
lises, of Rose Bay. Glory is the only
daughter of the Dr. G. Bohrsmans, of
Enmore.
Muriel Conroy, a young daughter of
Alfred, one of the brilliant puzzles of the
last generation of Parliament men, is among
the newly engaged. Her young man is Ronald
Duncan McDonald, of Corryong, Darling
Point.
There is something Moorish and Spanish
and Greek and Early Colonial about the
Sydney Boys’ High School, this Letter
was assured by various academic dons in
reply to its artless questions re the architec-
ture. But the total is a thing of beauty,
and maybe the beginning of a new era in
the architecture of our public buildings. It
is washed tropic white and its doors and
window sashes are a vivid green. Vivid
green, too, are the little balconies that jut
out unexpectedly from the upper windows,
and the fanlights, shaped like a rising sun,
are picked out in the same green. The
building is wide-stretching, and a comfort-
able two storeys high. It is fronted by a
long piazza tiled in Pompeiian red and im-
pressive with high lonic pillars. The wide
green entrance doors lead into a vestibule
steeped in sunlight even in June, and this
again leads into the inner court around
which the school is built. There’s a con-
necting corridor between the front block and
the rear, arched and pillared, rather in the
Moorish fashion. At present this is decked
with high green palms, but later on orange-
trees in squat green tubs are to be tucked
into the sunlit turnings. Each of the four
sides of the courtyard has its sunny ter-
race. There is light and air everywhere, the
pleasant class-rooms have real fireplaces,
and through the windows can be seen long
avenues of Moreton-bays and open spaces
of Moore Park. The school grounds retain
one princely Moreton-bay surrounded by
quite a retinue of lesser brethren and grace-
ful peppercorns. The school, which occu-
pies part of the old Zpo site on Moore
Park, was opened last Saturday by Minister
for Education Drummond.
The lads and lassies of McDowell’s, Ltd.,
are working hard for their 1928 Staff Ball,
which is to be held at the Palais Royal on
August 6. This year they are devoting the
proceeds to the building fund appeal for the
Deaf and Dumb and Blind Children. Other
friends of the cause are the directors of
Olympic Theatres, who will devote the first
night’s proceeds at their new Star Theatre at
Bondi Junction to the same building fund.
This show is dated for July 5, and will be
under the wing of the Rotary Club, which
has pledged itself to fill the 2000 seats at
10s. each.
The tower of St. Andrew’s rose etched in
electrics on the night of the College dance
last week. Within 1 , too, the hand of some
decorative genius had been busy; and a
pergola roofed with palm fronds and fes-
tooned with wistaria and lit by the roguish
glow of orange and violet and cherry Chinese
lanterns occupied the middle of the dining-
hall. which was used for dancing. In this
sat Principal Anderson and Mrs Anderson,
Professor and Mrs. Angus, Dr. and Mrs.
Burfitt, the Brascli McArthurs and ex-Modera-
tor John Edwards and his wife. There were
over 400 guests who danced in the Common
Room and sat out in the corridors and on
the stairs, and later had supper in a mar-
quee that looked positively feather-brained
with Iceland poppies and balloons.
Wait till newly-returned-from-America
knight Hugh Denison and Henry Braddon,
that headlight of the English-Speaking
Union, meet! Australia’s newest ex-Commis-
sioncr to the States affirmed coldly at the
Victoria League corroboree last week that
this idea of one-tongue-one-family is all my
eye and Betty Martin as far as U.S.A. is
concerned. Henry Braddon, of course —and
he is an ex-Commissioner, too- —is an apostle
of the red bond of kinship. They say that
when Greek joins Greek a fish-shop is the
result, and when knight meets knight this
Letter hopes to be at the boil-over. Mean-
time the Hugh Denisons are repatriating
themselves at their particular fastness, the
Royal Colonial Institute, and when the lady
hostessed last week’s billy-boiling she was
very handsome in a black frock that swung
the latest thing in capes.
King’s School Old Boys will rally round
the colors at the Ambassadors on July 10.

HOME LIGHTING
AND POWER PLANT
WHEN you know that one of the world s largest aeroplane
makers also builds an electric light and power plant, you
know that it must be something different—vastly superior. You
expect that it will be built with the same precision and care
that are exercised in aircraft manufacture. And when you
examine Electolite, you’re not disappointed!
All the experience gained in building about six thousand aero-
planes during the past twelve years, and of manufacturing
numbers of Electolite plants for the British War Office for
arduous war-time service, is incorporated in Electolite.
It is the strongest, simplest, longest-lasting plant ever offered in
Australia. It supplies ample power not only for lighting, but
also for operating an electric iron, vacuum cleaner, refrigerator,
milking machine, separator, churn and many other labor-saving
devices both in the home and on the farm.
And, above all, it is low in price, and so economical that many
users claim it to cost less than city electricity. Let us send you
literature giving complete details, without obligation on your part.

Chatter
Racing at Moonee Valley on Saturday
drew a big attendance, motor-cars innumer-
able taking the turn-off at Essendon Town
Hall, whicii flew the Australian and Tj.S.A.
flags in honor of the accomplished trans-
pacific flight. The club’s usual luck with
the weather held good, but there was a
keenness in the air that was responsible for
a brave array of furs of all species, wrap-
ping feminine punters. The committee
gathered many for luncheon around tables
adorned with gum-tips and yellow chrysan-*
themums. Amongst those who strolled on
the lawn were Rear-Admiral and Mrs.
Napier, Chief Justice Knox, the Ben Lem-
prieres, she wearing a dahlia-lined velour
hat above a black coney coat; Group-Cap-
tain Goble and his wife; American Consul
Garrels, and Russell Clarke. Dr. John
Merrillees’s wife was smart in sports rai-
ment of jersey cloth in tones of nigger and
fawn; Mrs. Percy Blackbourn wore a kolin-
sky fur coat with a brown felt hat, and Mrs.
A. Tolhurst was there with her daughter
Shirley, who is making a name for herself
as a golfer. Mr. and Mrs. Harold Le Roux,
who are spending a few days in town, were
joyfully greeted by hunt club members, and
Dr. Helen Rennie spent an afternoon with
the gee-gees.
Among the array of squirrel, mink and
other expensive furs that kept out the
cold air of Flemington on the second day
of the V.R.C. Birthday meeting a real
leopard-skin coat with mink collar and cuffs
caused the curious to do a bit of big-game
hunting themselves to discover the identity
of the wearer. Stalked to the birdcage, the
lady was found to be Mrs. St. Marr, one
of the three daughters of the late Wesley
Hall, who accumulated much wealth by min-
ing and land transactions in these parts,
subsequently making his home in London.
Mrs. St. Marr, who was May Hall, is visit-
ing Australia' with her husband, who is
French and possessed of a title. General
Chauvel and his lady; Commander Ireland,
and his wife, she wearing a sports suit of sul-
phur hue with a nigger-brown hat; the Pre-
mier with Mrs. Hogan, whose powder-blue
coat was edged with grey fur and topped by a
felt hat; Mrs. Oscar Lempriere and daughter
Margot, and Mrs. Mortill, who was intro-
ducing Madame Ilenkina, the Russian prima
donna, to Flemington, were on the lawn.
The overflowing audience at His Majesty’s
on Saturday was a very well-dressed one,
for society had its curiosity tickled concern-
ing Puccini’s unfinished “Turandot.” The
evening had its interesting moments. By
a coincidence the composer laid down his
pen after recording the death of the slave
girl Tui in the first scene of the last act.
At the word-of the conductor the orchestra
and the whole house stood silently for a few
minutes at that stage, and then tenor Merli
and soprano Lombardi resumed their love-
making according to the score of Maestro
F. Alfano, who completed the work. The
extraordinarily beautiful setting of. the
second act fully atoned for the wait of
about 25 minutes which preceded it. The
costumes were magnificent, glittering head-
pieces, figured silken robes, picturesque uni-
forms and weird banners making a wonderful
color display, which set oil’ appropriately
the golden and bead-embroidered robes and
plumed and bejewelled headdress of the lead-
ing lady. Nevin Tait, at the final curtain,
told the audience it had cost £2OOO to
stage the Oriental opera, and for once in a
way no one doubted the word of an entre-
preneur.
Dame Nellie Melba, showing fawn-and-
blue drapery beneath a silver-and-blue bro-
cade coat, bad a centre d.-c. stance with the
Keppel Palmer couple and Bernard Heinze.
Mrs. George Armstrong glittered in black
sequins, accompanied by Elena Danieli and
Dr. Doyle. Italian Consul-General Gros-
sardi was there with his wife and daughter.
John Longstaff was among some of the rest-
ing prima donnas in a box shared by John
Brownlee, who got a vociferous reception.
Toti dal Monte, who wore a coiffure adorn-
ment like the milky way, done in pearls, also
had to bow to a welcome. Silver-and-gold
tissue toques and bandeaux were much in
evidence, Mrs. Tliirkell and Mrs. Felix
Lloyd being followers of the fashion. Mrs.
Geoffrey Syme, wearing pink, took the eye.
Mrs. Fritz Hart and Basil were in the
d.c.; also the Whitings, Mrs. Mark Gar-
diner, Mrs. Albert Miller and Mrs. Black-
wood. T. 11. Kelly, from Sydney; Mrs.
Hogarth; from the Apple Isle, who was there
with her daughters, Mrs. R. H. Morton and
Agnes Hogarth; the Colin Fraser couple, the
\V. Mortills and Cliff Ormiston likewise
paid their tribute at Puccini’s shrine.
. Lots of quite important people were grate-
ful for standing-room at the premiere of
“Cavaileria Rusticana” and “I Pagliacci,”
doubled on the bill at His Majesty’s last
week. Interest chiefly centred in the dfebut
uf Dame Nellie Melba’s American protegee
Helen Daniel (Elena Danieli on the stage)
as Nedda in ’“I Pagliacci.” and of John.
Brownlee, as Tonio. in the same opera.
The dark-eyed brunette looked dashing in
her beribboned frock and red millinery of the
first act, and was equally well suited by
the magpie pier.rette outfit that later clothed
the part. She scored heavily with her
singing, and was rewarded with many
flowers; a tall arrangement of. blossoms was
tipped with the Stars and Stripes and the
Australian flag. Used to the pantaloons and
pompoms of a clown, old operagoers got a
shock when John Brownlee stepped out for
the famous Prologue. ’Twas the handy man
around a travelling show • who parted the
curtains, wearing patched grey trousers, a
leaf-green waistcoat and a knotted rose-pink
’kerchief, with an old felt hat. In the play
within the play of act two he put on the
regulation motley and even a red wig. In
breathless silence the house listened to the
baritone’s beauteous notes, and a brava from
Melba caused the enthusiasm to burst its
bonds before the “Ring up the rag!” that con-
cludes the number. The curtain-raising had
to wait till the excitement was worked off.
Xenia Belmas, as Santuzza in “Cavaileria
Rusticana,” her first appearance in the part,
had the misfortune to tear her frock above
the hem-line; and, uneasily conscious of a
length of stocking showing, she had to carry
on until the intermezzo gave her a chance
of retiring for running repairs.
Looking in her red bridge coat over white
gown like a sports girl on a magazine cover,
Melba had as her box companions the
American Consul Arthur Garrels and his
wife, whose frock was of subdued gold. Some
smart wraps were sported in the d.c., two
in cloak-form featuring black-and-white
stripes. Ermine coverings were so numerous
as to be almost commonplace, and one won-
dered if they could all be real. Norman
Falkiner, just elected by South Melbournites
to the House of Landlords, was there with
his good-looking wife. Mrs. Dermot Casey
and Mrs. Geoffrey Gibbs were neighbors. The
Philip Nunns, Mrs. W. 11. Merry, Strella
Wilson in silvery blue coat, Hilda Meadows,
most of the resting principals of the Wil-
liamson co. and several from the Gonsalez
team helped to"'fill the house.
To-morrow night ; a number of talented
young people will appear in Ernest Denny’s

The attendance of swarms of St. John
nurses and members, of the. Civil Ambulance
Service at the Town Hall on Thursday night
gave a general impression that some terrible
calamity had occurred, but the mobilisation
was caused by nothing more serious than the
V.O.A.S. annual ball. Rose Paterson was
again lion, organising sec., and her efforts
were rewarded by a good roll-up, headed by
the State Governor, who was accompanied
by Lady Somers, in black, with an all-over
twinkle ..of crystal. Mayor and Mayoress
Morel 1 welcomed the v.-r. guests, backed by
Rear-Admiral Napier, whose wife wore corn-
flower blue apparel, and General Chauvel,
accompanied by his lady in pink, the upper
section glistening with colored embroidery.
The Mayoress wore draperies of sapphire-
blue velvet attached to gleaming shoulder
straps. Sheila Morell was .one of the many
wearers of green, which contested the popu-
larity stakes with blue. Leaf-green, speckled
with rhinestones; was her choice. Miss
Aimee Paterson sported an all-app]e-green
effect that included shoes and hose. Spotted
black net that hung over pale pink was
worn by Mrs. Arthur Paterson. Mrs. M. P.
McMillan, in black, brought some workers
of the M.D.N.S. to sell balloons, her helpers
including Lynette Henderson, almost a gipsy
maid in pink with a sleeveless black velvet
coatee; and Billy Wiseher, who dangled a
necklet of blue beads upon a black velvet
frock. Dr. Esme Anderson caught the glance
in a frock of shades of violet; another
smartly-dressed woman medico was Dr.
Jean Littlejohn, in silvery-blue taffeta elab-
orately rucked. Floatings of wistaria georg-
ette surrounded Mrs. Fred Gilder, whose
sister, Lavender Stuart, wore buff-colored
guipure lace. Mrs. Russell Gabb was a gleam
of silver sequins. The Burnett Grays, Nor-
man Falkiners, Pulteney Meins and Albion
Walkleys were dancers.
On her way to Australia for a short visit
is Mrs. Collier, better known as Elsy Tre-
week, here pictured by Dickinson-Monteath.
Abo u t 18
months ago this
Melbourne so-
prano, wh o
earned fame
abr o a d i n
opera and on
the concert
platform, re-
turned to give
a series of re-
eita 1 s. En-
gagements fell
so fast upon
her that she
had no time to
rchew o 1 d
friendships,
and the omis-
sion will be
remedied o n
this occasion.
The singer
will be joined
in Melbourne shortly by her husband, who
has yet to finish a contract at a London
theatre. They have a small daughter who
already shows signs of vocal talent.
On Friday night old Toorak Collegians
jazzed at the Erplnissy to provide funds for
a library in the new school at Frankston.
Mrs. Frank Faulkner, in black with a glow
of pink beneath, was head of the committee,
and Margaret Cumining, in peach-pink with
a glint of crystal, and Christina Brown, who
showed sparkling embroidery upon a deeper
liued frock, shared secretarial duties. Mrs.
E. M. Herring, another of the engineers,
introduced a touch of the Orient with gold
embellishment uprin a deep-red gown. Mrs.
Russell Gabb and some other well-turned-out
folk helped with successful, sales. of cigar-
ettes and carnival novelties. The trio of
principals of Toorak College, the Misses
Hamilton, were present, together with the
George Russells, Norman McArthurs, Nor-
man Barretts, Mrs. W. Fanning and nume-
rous prettily-chid maidens.
There was a cordial and friendly air about
the recital of pianist Margaret Sutherland
and singer Ivy Philips (Mrs. Smuts) held
at the Assembly Hall under the aegis of
the 'HnT.’ Coil 1 lame Nellie MeTba'satTn the
front row and expressed approval with fre-
quent bravas. Wearing the palest of pink
frocks f fih ged~~With crystal; - Mrs. Smuts’
captivated her audience. She was heard
in groups of Italian, German, French and
modern British songs, to which Margaret
Sutherland furnished artistic accompani-
ments. Heaps of beautiful flowers were passed
over the palm-bordered footlights to the two.
At the conclusion Dame Nellie stepped upon
the platform and complimented both clever-.
Australians, saying she had thoroughly en-
joyed herself and had listened to some of the
most beautiful singing she had ever heard.
The diva, who cast aside a sable-collared
silver wrap, was in white with a light cloak
of roseate hue, Mrs. George Armstrong,
Elena Danieli and Tommy Cochran attended
the Dame, who received a presentation posy,
and added Bernard Heinze, Edward Goll and
J. Sutton Crow to her party. Constance
Neville, Johns, another returned singer who
comes back with a. big American reputa-
tion, was in the audience.
“Anna Christie” was a first night offering
of the, Gregan McMa 1 \on co. at the King’s
on Saturday, but: some of the usual train of
repertory play lovers seem to have deserted
in favor of the Puccini Chinese opera, for
the attendance was not good. Mr. and Mrs.
M. M. Phillips, Mrs. Gilruth, Mrs. Malcolm
Robertson, painter Harold Herbert (who is
at present holding a successful show), Mrs.
Norman Simpson and Beatrice Day, who
is not in the present cast, were numbered
among the faithful. Daphne Deane and
Leal Douglas, the only ladies in the produc-
tion, received lovely posies, and Gregan Mc-
Mahon was called upon for a speech, but
refrained.
Members of the Victoria League gathered
for their monthly tea and talk at club rooms
gay with bronze-hued chrysanthemums, vio-
lets and other winter blooms one afternoon
last week. A bunch of hostesses included
Mrs. Talbot Brett, Mrs. George Blanch, Mrs.
Albert Miller, Mrs. Edwin Austin and Mrs.
Arnold Caddy. Mrs. Henry Cave and Mrs.
T. a’Beckett were speakers, and ’cellist
Sheila Macfie waved a baton over an
orchestra in lulls between the gusts of
chatter.
Artist Hilda Ilix Nicholas, who held a
successful show here a couple of weeks ago,
took a second plunge into matrimony last
week at St. Paul’s Cathedral. This clever
wielder of brush and pencil received most of
her knowledge of art abroad. She was a
war widow. The sharer of her future joys
and trials is Edgar Percy Wright, of Tom-
bong station, Delegate (N.S.W.).
A link between two well-known Western
District families was forged on Thursday
at the Camperdown kirk, when Edie, a
daughter of tin; late Angus Urquhart, changed
over to the part of Mrs. Charles McCardel,
chatelaine of Runnymede station, Caster-
ton. The bride’s white georgette frock was
topped by a nattier-blue hat, her sister. Mrs.
W. It. Armstrong, giving support as matron
of honor. Relatives and a few old friends
attended the after-rejoicings at the Robert
Jamiesons’ home. Stony Point. The bride-
groom is son of the late Dr. McCardel and of
Mrs. Lyster Jackson, South Yarra.
Nuptial mass was celebrated at St.
Joseph’s, Malvern, by Bishop Ryan as part of
the ceremonial attending the wedding of
Bertha, eldest daughter of Mrs. J. S. Collid-
ing, of Malvern, and John W. McCauley, of
Hawthorn. The bride’s simple white velvet
robe, long of sleeve, was enhanced by a veil
of Limerick lace that flowed into a train.
Her sister Kitty attended in a modestly-cut
soft, pink frock, with hat of the same shade.
There was a considerable flutter of excite-
ment over the linking of Keith Murdoch,
managing editor of the Herald and Weekly
Times, and Elizabeth, the youngest daughter
of the Rupert Greenes, of Toorak. The bonds
were forged at Scots’ Kirk by the bride-
groom’s father, the Rev. P. J. Murdoch, with
choral accompaniment and a setting of arum-
lilies and foliage. The bride, not long out
of the schoolroom, wore an ankle-length gown
of white tulle frills, attached to a bodice
of satin that was shrouded with a veil of
Limerick lace. Her sister Marie attended
in biscuit-lmed lace and harmonising felt
millinery. Dame Nellie Melba was one of
the guests bidden to the marriage feast.
Forrest, the new Canberra home of the
J. G. McLarens, was trimmed with autumn
berries and gum foliage to receive a gay
week-end party. The three daughters of tin'
"house, Mildred, May and Jean, sent out invi-
tations to Melbourne’s younger set, tand
there was an enthusiastic response. Amongst
the dancers were Beth Glasgow, Jean Star-
ling, Beryl Many John Butters’s lass Mollie.
the Garrans’ sons, Peter and Andrew, home
on a ’Varsity vacation, 11. Innes and and A.
Trogair. Supper was served amidst a riot of
chrysanthemums.
Henry, the last and youngest of the four
Madden brothers, passed out suddenly at his
Toorak home last week. John Madden, Vic-
toria’s Chief Justice, was first to go, and
Frank and Walter followed in rather quick
succession. --Belonging to a liorse-loving gen-
eration, they persisted in using horse-drawn
vehicles long after the arrival of the Motor
.Age..... Henry.. Madden was. fiUgagfid^forjyga.rs
in shipping horses to India. On arriving
with his family in this State in 1857 he
took up land in the Flemington district, and
lived there for many years on the Traven-
court estate, which was lately subdivided and
sold to great advantage. Two sons and four
daughters survive him. The former, origi-
nally intended for professional careers, went
on the land in the Western District after
their return from the Great War, with a
sister as housekeeper, and are making a suc-
cess of their venture.
The Melbourne City Mission sends out an
especially urgent SOS for supplies for the
cold and needy, since unemployment this
winter is figured to be greater than in any of
the last 20 years. The M.C.M. works in 10
districts and maintains several institutions.
Among its present needs is £lO.OOO to re-
build the old weatherboard premises known
as Dr. Singleton’s Homes at Collingwood.
Yet another Australian actor, Tom
Broderick, has proved himsef equal to re-
quirements when picked out of the chorus
and pushed on to play a leading role without
rehearsal. In Perth, during the run of
“Lilac Time,” John Ralston fell ill, neces-
sitating a reshuffling of parts. Tom Brod-
erick played Andreas Braun with success,
and when later, in Adelaide, he was again
called upon to come forward as a principal,
criticisms were flattering. The young man
has only been on the boards for a short
period, and hasn’t yet made up his mind
whether he will stay behind the footlights
or settle on the land.
Though Asia wears a troubled aspect,
it is still a magnet for rovers. The Harry
Prells are sailing in the Arafura for a
wander through China before crossing over
to look at Japan, and Java is also on their
visiting list. Niece Winnie has been invited
to be one of the party.

Brisbane.
On Saturday morning all eyes in this city
were turned to the east, but it was from the
south that the giant Southern Cross came
winging her way through the slight haze of a
perfect winter’s morning. Seen first as a
tiny speck, the great Fokker, putting her
best foot forward on the last lap, was in
full view in a minute or so. She circled
twice over Eagle Farm aerodrome, and then
the furious roar of her engines stopped sud-
denly and she swooped gracefully to earth.
The crowd burst all bounds, and police, horse
and foot had a hard struggle to keep the
excited throng out of range of the still revolv-
ing propellers. However, there -were no casu-
alties, and the crowd cheered itself hoarse.
Among the first to greet the air-voyagers
were a bunch of Brisbane uncles, aunts and
cousins and other personal friends of Kings-
ford Smith. Sir John Goodwin, Premier Mc-
Cormack and Deputy-Mayor Watson had their
innings a moment later. Then the aviators,
grinning delightedly, and puffing joyously at
their first smokes for 21 hours, were whirled
off to the Town Hall, where they were given
another tremendous ovation and listened to
some enthusiastic speechifying. Smith and
11m and their American companions were
given a State banquet at Lennon’s at night,
and were off to Sydney bright and early on
Sunday morning. Naturally, Brisbane is
immensely bucked to be chosen as the ter-
minal of the world’s greatest trans-ocean
flight.
The Saudgate Town Hall was dressed up
with flags for the Diggers' Ball, to which
Sir John and Lady Goodwin went. Palms
and hanging baskets of gum-tips, gay poin-
srttias and strings of red, white and blue
electric lights did their cheery bit. H.
Sizer, M.L.A., and Mrs. Sizer received the
Governor’s party. Lady Goodwin was in
sequinned midnight-blue mariette. Mrs.
A. E. White presented her with red roses
and afterwards brought forward nine debs,
for inspection. There was a good roll-up.
Uosemount, the Repatriation Hospital,
misses the cheerful presence of Dr. Charles
Mattei, who has taken up private practice
in North Rose Bay, Sydney. Before his de-
parture, presents were made to the doctor
by the Digger patients, the matron and nurs-
ing staff and the administration and medi-
cal staff; then he was entertained at lunch
by Governor Goodwin and at a Queensland
Club dinner by A.I.F. medical officers. Dr.
.Mattei served throughout the Boer War
and the Great War, and attained the rank of
Lieut.-Col. in the A.I.F.
Tom Macleod, who numbers the Croix de
Guerre (with palm) and an 0.8. E. among
bis distinctions and who has political aspira-
tions, married Lady Aurea VVace, a pro-
minent Prohibitionist, in the kirk at Rock-
hampton, Mrs Marshall, who came from
England with her, being matron of honor.
After the wedding the couple motored to
the bridegroom’s station home near Long-
reach.
WESTRALIA.
Perth.
The first day of the W.A.T.C. winter meet-
ing fell on the first fine afternoon after a
week's deluge, and black or grey tailored
suits were almost universal. The vice-regals,
attended by Major Kerr-Pearse and Captain
Secombe, occupied their pen; Lady Campion
in a sable coat and black velour hat, and
Mrs. Kerr-Pearse in a black coat trimmed
with grey squirrel. Mrs. Guy McLeod wore
a black coat and skirt and flesli-pink felt,
Mrs. Farrar cedar-bark and a sailor hat,
Mrs. Dick Stawell mocha-grey, and Poppy
Salom musk-melon jersey suiting. Doreen
O’Hara, wearing a skunk collar on her black
coat, came with Alollie Atkins, in navy.
Eileen Hayes wore Holland-blue and warmed
her shoulders with a beautiful brown fox.
Hope Robertson chose a coat and small felt
hat of chicadeergrey.
This is a Bardwell Clarke picture of Airs.
Frank Robertson, wife of one of our best-
known teachers of singing and herself a
musician of note. Airs. Robertson hails
from S.A. and won an oversea Elder Scholar-
ship at Adelaide Uni. She studied the
piano and singing at the London R.C.M.,
where she had
the ill-luck to
seriously in-
jure her right
hand in a
romp with her
friend Clara
P» u 11. She
played lef t-
liand solos to
Adelaide audi-
ences, and
since coming
west 20 years
ago has done
all her hus-
band’s accom-
panying and
worked up a
good piano-
forte teaching
connection of
her own. With
her daughter
Jean she sails
this month for England to visit her son
John Juan (known here as John Fox) and
his wife and partner Zelda, two young Aus-
tralians -who have danced their way into the
favor of the English public.
Miss Flapper and her mother were trans-
formed into staid, dignified ladies of the
last century at the Old Times ball. Dresses
that grandmamma wore were taken from their
layers of mothballs; and swishing trains,
boned bodices, bunches of curls and heavy
old-fashioned pieces of jewellery had a night
out. The men eyed one another in flowered
waistcoats and side-whiskers. The quadrille,
the mazurka, the polka and the galop —not
forgetting the waltz —filled the early part of
the programme. His Ex. was among the
first on the floor for the polka, and skipped
through the Sir Roger de Coverley with real
enjoyment. Lady Campion wore pansy georg-
ette. Mrs. Irwin Burges was in a bunched
and bustled gown of flowered silk. Kitty
Gillies, in green velvet, embroidered with
spangles; Mrs. N. D’Arcy, in black; and
Mrs. A. Jacoby, with three feathers bobbing
above her court gown of gorgeous pale-
gold brocade —all three with long flowing
trains —were regal figures heading the grand
march. Mrs. Charlie Heppingstone wore
an old-time frock of black taffeta spotted in
white, and Mrs. S. Barker sported a white
wig above royal-blue velvet and a lace
bertha. Mrs. Frank Davies was striking
in plum brocade and a pancake hat, Mrs.
Jim Withnell wore a beautiful gown of blue
brocade and lilac tissue, and Hetty Forbes,
with a coffure of corkscrew curls, danced
in a pretty set of rose-pink hooped skirts.
Daphne de Bernales, in an early-Victorian
set of pastel taffetas, and Judy James were
among the demure Kate Greenaway girls.
Kitty Clifton wore bustled canary net and a
iaced-up-the-front bodice of satin ; Mrs. Tom
Leake wore a violet cape over lilac and
white satin ; and Mamie Brown had a short
train to her slim, high waisted gown of white
lace.
TASMANIA.

Margaret O’Grady was one of the 30
hostesses at the big bridge and mah-jongg
party at Hadley’s in aid of the Victoria
League’s library fund. The first prize, a
silver spoon, given by the president, Mrs.
Stourton, went to Mrs. Grant; and a prize
for the highest score fell to Mrs. Oldmeadow.
The O'Grady’s daughter Margaret has
gone to Sydney, via Melbourne, for a holi-
day, and N. E. Somers, private sec., is on
leave in Victoria, so vice-regal activities will
bo at a low ebb for a while. Winter is
really upon us now, and bridge and parties
at the various dance resorts provide most
of our social occasions.

co. The young
actor married a daughter of legal knight
Josiali Symon, of Adelaide, a couple of
years ago.
G. A. Jackson’s programme for the Choral
Society’s first concert of the season embraced
three old-fashioned chorals (Luther, 152!)),
the words of which were translated into
English verse by Celia Mailing. The con-
ductor's own short work entitled “A Study”
was performed, the orchestra acquitting it-
self remarkably well. Doreen Bideneopc
and Lila Harvey were - soloists.
The Ilitz Cabaret flourishes under the
new management of Mrs. Alan Vowles, who,
herself a dancer trained in London and
Paris, is determined to introduce a little
Continental gaiety into our rather stolid
community. The plucky little lady was laid
low by appendicitis just at the time when
she had advertised the opening, but is now
practically recovered.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Adelaide.
The inter-State boat race at Mannum, a
50-miles motor run from the city, was
patronised by the vice-regal party, which
had to give the first day of the A.R.C.
meeting a miss; but on the second day
Government House turned up at Victoria
Park in full force. Another visitor was
Mayor Bonython, who, as a rule, graces only
the municipal course. The Mayoress, how-
ever. is a keen sport, and in her snappy
gazelle skin coat she picked several winners.
The Government House party was not a
dressy bunch. Lady Hore-Ruthven wore a
navy tailored suit and felt hat to match,
and Miss Denise Daly a navy suit and hat.
Gwen Hall did the honors for her father,
the chairman of the club, in a wine cloth
fur-trimmed coat and a browm felt hat.
Justice Napier prefers golf to racing, but
his wife knows how to pick an outsider, and
was on Stargat’s £26 dividend. Tom O’Hal-
loran, K.C.. busy on the Child Endowment
Commission, returned to Adelaide, attended
the Birthday Cup meeting, and left by train
next day for Melbourne. The weather was
very keen on the first day, and every beast
of the field supplied skins for fair (and
other) wearers. Cow, calf, goat, pony,
rabbit —glorified into electric seal and other
fanciful beasts—clad the common herd, while
those with a large banking account despoiled
the jungle, and wore the pelts of tiger,
leopard, gazelle, antelope and bear.
This is the age of speed. Nellie Scarfe, of
Adelaide, and Pirie Bush, of Melbourne,
whose engagement was announced a fort-
night ago, will take one another for better
or worse to-morrow in Melbourne. These
two States are putting up.quite a Hands-
Across-the-Desert record lately in the matri-
monial line, but Melbourne always bags the
ceremony, which is bad for trade on this
side. Mrs. Scarfe and her daughter have
left for the eastern State, and several girl
friends of the bride are dashing over for
the wedding.

By L.VANSITTAET.
TIIIO afternoon rush in the Celestial
Department devoted to the affairs of
Minor Mortals was just over and the
customary daily lull was at hand. The
Senior Angel in charge relaxed and looked
down at the scurrying human antheaps be-
low. Then, a thought suddenly striking
him, he leaned across his desk and began to
sort through a large pile of cards, each one
bearing a neatly-typed name and address.
After a few minutes lie selected five cards,
the names upon which were Claire Eliza-
beth Smith-Furness, Louis Solomons, George
Edward Carrigan, Henry Bernard Jones and
Dolly de Mayne. He shuffled them about
reflectively for a while, and then, moved by
a second thought, added another which bore
the name of Constable William Murphy.
Fastening the six together with a rubber
band, he dropped them into a wire basket
marked “For Attention —Immediate,” from
where they were instantly removed by a
probationary angel, and settled back to
watch what followed.
For nearly three weeks Mrs. Smith-Fur-
ness had been occupied with the desperate
problem of raising the hundred pounds which
she required for the settlement of some press-
ing little personal debts of a sort that would
have contributed nothing at all to marital
harmony had they reached the ears of her
husband. Now, for the dozenth time that
day, she took from a drawer in the boudoir
table what represented practically her lasi:
hope, a diamond necklace glittering with
ostentatious vulgarity.
She laid it down again after a few minutes
with a sigh and began to unwrap a small
parcel, from whose folds of soft white paper
there emerged finally another necklace, appa-
rently an exact facsimile of the first. There
was, indeed, only one respect in which they
differed, the second necklace being a syn-
thetic product of the chemist’s skill, worth
only the merest fraction of the value of the
other.
For some time Mrs. Smith-Furness studied
the two necklaces closely, subjecting each
to a careful comparison with the other.
When at last she felt satisfied that there
was little risk of her husband detecting the
substitution, she rose from where she had
been sitting, and, dropping the spurious one
into a drawer of the table, locked the drawer
and. after placing its key in her handbag
with the genuine necklace, set about dress-
ing with the air of one from whose shoul-
ders black Care had just been lifted. Half
an hour later she shut the door of the flat
behind her and descended to the street, the
bag with the diamond necklace in it swing-
ing from her wrist.
Ten minutes passed and then Mr. “Sink-
ers” Carrigan, giving a swift glance around
to make sure that he was unobserved,
emerged from the fire-escape outside, from
which he had been watching her departure,
and successfully negotiated a small window
close by. Some seconds later and he was
sniffing at the perfume-laden atmosphere of
Mrs. Smith-Furness’s boudoir, while lie cast
a critical professional eye over its interior.
There was nothing of any real value any-
where in sight, but that did not deter Sink-
ers, who was a highly-skilled craftsman with
his heart in his work, and well aware of
the different places in which people were
accustomed to conceal their valuables. The
boudoir table attracted his attention first,
and, crossing over to it, he began to pull out'
the drawers. A miscellaneous collection of
all those useless odds and ends by which
women set such store greeted his gaze as
he leisurely tipped the contents of one
drawer after another on to the floor. Then
he came to the one which was locked, and
instantly his professional instincts were
aroused.
From one of his pockets Mr. Carrigan
produced a small instrument not unlike one
of those handy little contrivances for re-
moving tacks, and,
pulling out its tele-
scopic handle, in-
serted the flat end.
There was the
sound of breaking
woodwork, and the
next instant his
eyes were resting
upon the counter-
feit necklace.
Ever since "Sinkers had graduated from
robbing drunken men in public parks he
had dreamed of just such a haul as that
which now lay before him. For nearly a
full minute he stared at its meretricious
glitter before making a swift grab at the
gems, as though he feared that they might
suddenly elude him. As lie lovingly stowed
the necklace away, a series of close-ups of
the glorious future flitted in swift proces-
sion across his mental vision.
A quick glance through the window by
which he had entered showed that the way
out was still clear. Possibly there were
other valuables in the flat, but with that
gorgeous piece of plunder already safe in his
possession he was not disposed to risk any
time in searching for them. He reached the
street without difficulty, and. strolling non-
chalantly past a couple of policeman engaged
in seeing that the corner hotel closed sharply
at six, turned into a narrow, uninviting lane
near by. From there his way lay through
mean streets and squalid thoroughfares until
at last he came out in a part of the city’s
lesser business section. A short distance
further on he entered a small building of
dingy and battered appearance, and, looking
neither to his right nor to his left, ascended
“Withdrawing the bundle, she unwrapped it and stood looking at the diamonds with
an expression of incredulity.”
the stairs to the first floor and halted out-
side an office on whose door was painted the
intimation that within was the place of busi-
ness of Mr. Louis Solomons, Agent and
Financier.
As with charity, a multitude of sins is
covered by the word agent, which in this
particular instance meant that Mr. Solomons
was what the underworld calls a fence, one
who dealt only with those whom he knew to
be safe. These transactions, most of them
representing a profit calculated to make the
original Shylock mutter enviously in his
grave, were camouflaged with a modicum of
business along semi-respectable lines, chiefly
in the direction of small loans to approved
clients.
Mr. Carrigan was about to knock when
the office door opened suddenly and a lady
came out, stuffing some notes into her bag.
With a start he recognised her as the one
whose departure he had so recently wit-
nessed from the fire-escape outside the flat,
and somehow, with the superstition in-
herent in his kind, he was vaguely troubled
by the coincidence of their meeting, as though
it were an omen which portended no good.
But the lady was apparently too busy with
her own thoughts to notice him, and she
passed straight on down the stairs and into
the street beyond. He stood there staring
at her until she had vanished from sight
before ho pushed open the door and walked
in. At his entry Mr. Solomons, a neat and
dapper little man with a waxed moustache,
looked up from the ledger with which he
was busy.
“ ’Lo,” he remarked. “What brings you
’ere?”
It was on the tip of his vistor’s tongue
to say something about the caller who had
just left, but with the inborn distrust of
the thief for the receiver, lie refrained, re-
flecting that the fewer clues lie supplied
the better. So, by way of reply he dived
into his pocket and brought out the sham
necklace.
“’Ave a look at that,” he invited. “Ain’t
too bad, is it?”
For the moment the fishy little eyes of
Mr. Solomons bulged, just as those of Sink-
ers had done a little earlier, and surprise
rendered him temporarily incapable of words.
As though hardly able to believe what he
saw, he picked up the necklace and turned
it over wonderingly, examining the stones
and their settings. All of which Mr. Carri-
gan duly noted, and in his simple way inter-
preted as honest admiration, resolving then
and there to ask a price higher than he had
at first intended.
At length the other regained his powers
of speech.
“Were didya get it, Sinkers?” he de-
manded as soon as he could,
Mr. Carrigan laughed scornfully. “Now,
Looey,” he reproved, “you know I never
goes arskin’ yer no questions erbout yer
business, do I?”
Mr. Solomons hastened to dispel the sug-
gestion of idle curiosity. “It’s not that,
Sinkers,” he told him. “I was only just
wonderin’ w’ere yer picked it up, because
the whole thing’s snide. Them ain’t dia-
mon’s, me boy, only imitations. Good ’uns,
I’ll admit, but they ain’t ther real thing. ’
It was the turn of Mr. Carrigan to regis-
ter amazement. “What?” he gasped. “D ye
mean ter say it ain’t dinkum?” He appeared
to be about to strangle where he sat. “Yer
lyin’,” he observed, with the painful and
undecorated directness of the uncultured.
Mr. Solomons ignored the accusation —
one which he had heard before on occasions
■—knowing that in this instance it was merely
rhetorical. “S’fact, Sinkers,” he assured
him. “Yer know / wouldn’t put nothin’ over
on yer. Them’s paste, worth only a few bob
at th’ outside. O’ course, if they was real”
He did not finish, but left the rest to
his client’s imagination.
Mr. Carrigan stared venomously at the
necklace where it lay upon the table, while
Solomons smiled loftily with the omniscient
air of the expert on his own safe ground.
“I suppose yer right,” said the former
grudgingly after a while. “AVhat’s it worth,
anyway? Might’s well get somefin out o’
it.”
Mr. Solomons did not answer immediately.
Instead, his thoughts were concentrated upon
the amazing coincidence that the faked neck-
lace should have been brought to him just
after he had lent Mrs. Smith-Furness a hun-
dred pounds on its genuine counterpart.
Dimly there began to shape itself a plan
by which the surprising occurrence might
be turned to his own personal profit.
“Tell yer what, Sink, old boy,” he said,
after a short period of rapid reflection.
“This stuff ain’t really worth anything at
all, yer know. Not to me, that is,” he
added hurriedly as Carrigan opened his mouth
to say something. “But jest ter pay yer
for yer trouble I’ll let yer ’ave a couple o'
quid on it. That all right?”
Sitting amid the dismal ruins of his
dreams, the disconsolate Mr. Carrigan indi-
cated that it was, what time the 'nailing
barmaids and the losing bookmakers van-
ished hazily over the far horizon. From
a pocketbook Mr. Solomons extracted two
pound-notes and passed them over. Then
he put the necklace in a drawer of his table,
and as Sinkers stood up to depart, smiled
sympathetically at him.
“Stiff luck,” he said, “but when yer get
somethin’ really good yer '/(now where ter
bring it.”
“S’long,” replied Sinkers gloomily, and
shutting the door behind him went slowly
down the stairs and so out of this narra-
tive.
Immediately he had gone, Mr. Solomons
took from his office safe the genuine neck-
lace recently deposited by Mrs. Smith-Fur-
ness and, placing it with the paste one on
the table, scrutinised them both minutely.
Evidently the examination pleased him, for
he gave vent to a series of delighted chuckles
and spoke aloud. “Beauts,” he said. “Not
a scrap o’ difference, barrin’ ther price.”
Still smiling happily, he replaced the genuine
one in its plush-lined case, which bore the
monogrammed initials of its owner on the
lid, and, putting the other on top of it.
wrapped them both up in a large silk hand-
kerchief of somewhat clamorous design. The
small bundle so made he stowed away in an
inside pocket of his coat. Mr. Solomons
knew of many much safer hiding-places for
such property than an office that was always
likely to be turned over at any moment by
virtue of the provisions of a search warrant.
Probably because he was so engrossed
with the details of a plan to substitute the
fake for the real necklace when Mrs. Smith-
Furness came to redeem her jewellery, lie
failed entirely to notice that when he boarded
his tram a nondescript sort of person known
in underworld circles as Barney the Whizz
climbed up after him. The same abstraction
was also responsible for his not observing
anything suspicious about the way in which
Barney opened a newspaper and held ir
with its edge almost under Mr. Solomons’s
chin. Actually, Barney the Whizz was not
a very skilful pickpocket, but the preoccu-
pation of his victim aided him, and the rest
was easy.
The crowded tram lurched on, its passen-
gers swaying like trees in a wind, and rattled
heavily over a set of points. As it did so,
Barney stumbled, his paper causing Mr.
Solomons to throw back his head suddenly,
while the other made a quick effort to fend
himself off. Muttered apologies followed,
and Mr. Solomons returned to his inter-
rupted thoughts. At that moment Barney
apparently discovered that he had gone past
his stop, and gracefully let himself off on
the opposite side of the trani. It was just
as the hurrying crowd in a side street swal-
lowed him up that his victim came back to
life again with a painful jerk.
“Hey,” he cried, frantically clutching at
where the two necklaces had been a second
or so before. “Hey, stop ’im. Stop
that feller!” He waved his arms wildly
and seemed about to choke. The other pas-
sengers regarded him with the satisfaction
that is always felt when somebody does
something to disturb the monotony of life.
“Did ’e fan yer, mister?” asked a smoky-
faced artisan in a black shirt and dun-

SO Mr fin S3olom o ns glared at the honest fellow
•iud sprang from the tram, unmindful of
death or mutilation. Picking himself up
from where he landed, he started to run
towards where Barney had disappeared.
It was about twenty minutes later when
Barney alighted from a taxi in a quite dif-
ferent' part of the city and went into a
modest little restaurant which he and sun-
dry other initiates knew to be connected with
activities only remotely concerned in the
purveying of foodstuffs. As one enjoying
he right of private entree, he entered a
room at the rear and sat down at a table
already occupied. The occupant, Miss Do y
do Mayne by name, though not the one on
her birth certificate, glanced up.
“Night, Barney,” she remarked listlessly.
•llow's the game V”
“Tip-top,” was the response. Couldn t
be better.” True to type he could not
resist the temptation to boast, especially
to a woman. , ... ,
Miss de Mayne brightened perceptibly and
suggested a drink. , . ,
A frowsy-looking waiter approaching, lie
ordered a bottle of wine. “Good stuff, (.us,
an' never mind tlier change.” Ostentatiously
lie slapped down a ten-shilling note and
waved his hand. Miss de Mayne hitched
her chair a trifle closer.
"What’s doin’, Barney dear?” she cooed,
with marked interest. “Strike something
good, eh?” , .
At once Barney assumed the knowing
aspect of one concerned with matters of
major moment. “Tell yer later,’ lie pro-
mised. .
At that instant the wine arrived —a cheap
and nasty hock—and the waiter poured out
the two glasses. Then, grinning a sort ot
benediction upon Miss de Mayne, he went
away again. .
They were in a kind of half-curtained
alcove, more or less secure from outside
observation.
After some further desultory conversation
Miss de Mayne gave a well-simulated start.
"Look,” she said in a low, tense voice.
“That bloke just come in. A demon, ain’t
lie?”
Barney looked and saw a very ordinary
sort of person about to sit down. He
smiled loftily, as one who makes light of
woman’s fears.
“’Im?” he replied amusedly. “That ain’t
no jack. ’E works in a garage. Know ’im
well.” Barney had never seen the man
before in his life, but it was not his way
to admit ignorance to a woman.
Miss de Mayne sighed deeply with affected
relief, “Couldn’t think where I’d set eyes
on him,” she said untruthfully.
They returned to their wine, the lady
sipping hers leisurely in the manner of a
connoisseur of vintages, and noting from the
corner of her eye that the white powder
which she had slipped into Barney’s glass
during his momentary distraction had dis-
solved entirely. She settled back to await
developments.
Fifteen minutes passed, and then the effi-
cient Miss de Mayne rose from her chair
and stared down scornfully at the uncon-
scious form of her late companion. His
head was on the table, his face in a small
pool of wine from an overturned glass along-
side, and he snored and gurgled gustily in
his coma, the powder having done its work
well. She glanced beyond the curtains, but
the room was almost empty.
With a sudden tug she heaved him nearly
upright in his chair, and expertly ran her
hands over his body until they came to the
bulge caused by Mr. Solomons’s necklaces.
Withdrawing the bundle she unwrapped it
and stood looking at the diamonds with an
expression of incredulity. In that artifi-
cial light the genuine stones glittered and
sparkled in a way that stamped them at
once as things apart from the others.
Barney the Whizz still slumbered when
Miss de. Mayne strolled casually out of the
restaurant into the street. It would be
some hours yet before he discovered his
loss, and she was quite unperturbed by the
prospect of what he might do when he did.
Those who live outside the law can avail
themselves of no measure of its protection,
and, anyway, the chances were that she
could keep out of his path until the whole
thing had become only a memory, rankling
still, but not calling for any energetic action
by Barney.
Crossing the street before a tall block of
flats, she noticed two plainclothesmen hurry-
ing inside, and idly wondered at their busi-
ness. She would have been more than pass-
ingly interested had she known that it was in
response to the delighted Mrs. Smith-Furness’s
report of her loss. That lady, indeed, had
been hardly able to believe her good fortune
on returning from Mr. Solomons’s office and
finding the paste necklace gone. She felt
that she could have hugged the burglar had
he been there, but, as he wasn’t, she con-
tented herself with ringing up the police,
and composing a letter to the insurance com-
pany from which she carelessly omitted the
trifling detail that it was the uninsured paste
necklace and not the insured genuine one
which had been stolen. The cup of Mrs.
Smith-Furness’s content was brimming just
then.
At the corner, Miss de Mayne hailed a
passing taxi and gave an address in an ad-
joining suburb. When the car was well under
way she pulled down the blind, discreetly
shutting off the driver’s view, and took out
the necklace. One glance was enough to tell
her what she had suspected in the restau-
rant, that only one of them was any good.
She waited until the taxi was passing some
land covered with tall grass, and, leaning
out as far she could, threw the paste one,
still wrapped in its silk handkerchief, into
the grass, where it disappeared without so
much as a rustle.
Presently the car pulled up outside the
address given by Miss de Mayne. which was
the private residence of Mr. Solomons. Get-
ting out, she went to the side of the house
and rang. Almost instantly the door was
opened by Mr. Solomons himself.
“Oh,” he_ remarked, a trifle ungraciously.
"Its you, is it?” He held back the door
for her to enter and led the way to a room
where lie switched on the light before asking,
“M liadja want, Dolly? Got somethin’
good?”
It was plain that Mr. Solomons was not
at his best just then. His hair was rumpled
his eyes had a wild glare, and his face wa.
pallid with a sweaty whiteness like that ox
a chalk. Only a few' moments earlier he
had returned from a frantic but unsuccess v
search for the predatory Barney.
The girl looked curiously at him as she
brought out the necklace from the front oi
ligi* dress.
“Whadja think of that, Looey?” she asked.
“Is it any good, eh?”
Plainly it was Mr. Solomons s day foi
shocks. He stared unbelievingly at the
necklace for nearly a minute, making iunnj
little clucking noises in his throat. vv £ e y •
I’ll be damned!” lie said as soon as he lelt
equal to words.
“Thought it’d make a hit with you.
Looey,” his visitor remarked cheerfully. ' '
know you always like diamonds.”
For'the second time within a few hours
Mr. Solomons committed an underworld
faux pas. “Where didja get it?” he asked.
The lady merely smiled.
Struggling hard, the unhappy financier
choked down the impulse to tell her that
the necklace had been stolen from him only
a few hours before. There were a number
of good and sufficient reasons why lie should
not do so; and nearly as many why he did
not wish to antagonise Miss de Mayne. So
he swallowed hard again and asked, What
d’yer want fer it?”
There commenced a period of bargaining,
at the end of which Miss de Mayne emerged
happily stuffing into her silk stocking a roll
of notes, each one of which had been as an
eye-tooth to Mr. Solomons. She entered
tiie waiting taxi outside, and like Sinkers
Carrigan, Mrs. Smith-Furness and Mr. Solo-
mons, there and then drove right out or
this true record of events.
Just about the same time, the frowsy-
looking waiter was trying to shake Barney
the Whizz back into consciousness again.
With the dazed aspect of one who has
suffered a blow on the head from some blunt
instrument, Barney sat up and gazed un-
cpmpreliendingly around. His jumbled mind
was a fearful whirl of women, wine and
necklaces, as he stared stupidly up at tlie
waiter, , , •
“Come on,” said the latter. Lit out in
flier air an’ yer’ll be all right. Ther Johns
cr liable ter come in any minute.”
Obediently Barney rose and stumbled to
the door. Outside, in the cool air, his feet
seemed to become more tangled than ever,
and he sat down in the convenient gutter,
bis terrifically-aching head in his hands
Simultaneously, Constable Murphy, one week
from the training depot and as yet without
even a drunk to his record, rounded the
corner. Seeing Barney, he stopped and
gazed down speculatively at him.
“Not much,” he soliloquised, “but I suppose
he’ll do as well as any other to begin with.”
Stooping, he hoisted the. unprotesting Bar-
ney to his dangling feet.
“I see,” said the desk-sergeant a short time
later, “that the night lias not been alto-
getlier an empty one. Have a look at what
lie’s got.” „ , , .
From the pockets of the slumbering
Barney there was dredged forth a varied
assortment of cash, cigarettes, a broken
fountain-pen, keys, a lucky charm, totali-
sator tickets and other odds and ends. These
the sergeant was methodically cataloguing
when he picked up an oblong metal case.
“What’s this?” he asked with sudden interest.
“Looks like a box of some sort.” was
Constable Murphy’s helpful effort. “What’s
them letters on its lid, Sarge? C.E.S.IL,
ain’t they?”
The other regarded the somnolent Barney
with a new speculation. “This is the bloke
who did that flat job this afternoon,” lie
announced. “Here you are. Here’s the descrin-
tion of the box the diamonds were in.” He
flipped over a sheaf of reports, and read from
one of them, “ -metal case, about seven
by four inches, lined inside with velvet, and
with the initials ‘C.E.S.F.’ on lid.”
Constable Murphy had been only one
week in the Force, but already he had the
idea. . ~
“I thought he was the bloke all right,
lie said. “I had been watching him pretty
closely before I decided to take any definite
action.” He held up his head importantly,
and pulled down his tunic in front where
it was still a trifle too large.
“All right,” said the cynical sergeant.
“Whatever you say.” He opened a large
book, and began to write in it regarding the
luckless Barney and the looting of Mrs.
Smith-Furness’s substitute diamonds.
* * * *
The Senior Watch-keeping Angel picked
up the cards which had just been shot on
to his desk by a pneumatic carrier, and re-
moved from them a small slip of paper bear-
ing the word “Completed.” Crumpling it
up. lie dropped it to the floor and pulled
out the cards one by one from their rubber-
band, grinning to himself as he read the
names upon them. Then he threw them on
to a large heap waiting to be sorted, and
turned once more to the pressing affairs_ of
the other minor mortals in the scurrying
throngs below.
The Dead Day.
A little downy owl flits past
Here in the twilight grey;
The rarest sunshine will but last
The length of one sweet day.
The night conies like a long-drawn sigh
From one who’s had his bliss.
And every hint of day’s put by.
So stilly dark it is.
The day has been to me not what
It lias to others been :
Each heart has its own vision got
Of what was heard and seen.
Now thought and feeling seem to flow
With an intenser stream :
’Tis sweet to bury the day so
As in a perfect dream.
If all our days were buried thus,
The earth perchance would be
Too heavenly a place for us
And our mortality!

THE TOTEM.
By- ALYS BROWN.
LOTI was dead, and Marua village was
. mourning. All night long the big new
hut he had built only a month before
was crammed to suffocation with sweating,
chanting men and wailing women.
Never for one instant lmfl the riot of
noise ceased. Throughout the dark hours
throbbing kapas and booming conch shells
helped the mourners to keep at bay those
evil spirits which, scenting death from afar,
hover round, ready to take possession of
the quiet body.
When tne cock’s shrill crow called the
news of breaking dawn and danger over-
past, Loti, wrapped in taats, was borne
away on a litter by the menfolk.
With weary eyes his young wife, Vio,
watched the little procession straggle away
down the Government road. When the last
man had disappeared round the turning, she
threw a pandanus mat over her shaven head
and flung herself to the ground in dry-eyed
grief. Smooth brown skin shewed here and
there through the disfiguring coat of pot-
black and grease. Sweat had made little
runnels in the greasy black, and the blood
where she had torn her comely face and
shapely breasts in a passion of anguish had
dried in ugly black-rcd streaks.
Her small son, heedless of his mother’s woe,
ran to and fro, gleefully stabbing at an empty
gourd with his tiny spear, shouting to his
mother to admire his skill.
One by one the women left the hut, and
gathered in little groups round the fires in
the street. Though eyes were weary and
throats sore with wailing, they sat on tlicir
heels peeling yams and scraping fluffy heaps
of cocoanut into wooden bowls, ready for
the feast when the men returned.
As they worked they gossiped in hoarse
whispers. “Truly Vio has need to mourn.”
said Mata. “He who is gone,” carefully
avoiding the name of the dead, “was a good
husband. He never beat her more than
enough to let folks know that she had married
a man, and not a ninny.”
“She will mourn him more when Patoa
takes her,” said Melita with a coarse laugh.
“Already I see Pani moving her mats and
cooking-pots into the new house. It was
a fine day for Patoa when his brother died.
Grand new house, another young wife, fat
pigs and every some-something a man could
want without working for it. Tch! Tch !
The luck of some folks!”
“Did you see the burial mats. Mata?
Where were the fine new mats Vio had?”
asked her neighbor. “Pani brought some of
their old sleeping mats to wrap him in. What
shame to begrudge new mats to one who
sleeps the long sleep !”
Melita dumped her peeled yams into the
pot with a splash.
“The cooking-pots were cracked too,” said
Mata, scraping vigorously, “and I saw but
one broken toia put inside the mats. His spirit
was ill prepared for the long journey. Were
I Patoa I would be afraid of it returning
one night to fetch the rightful gear.”
Melita scratched her nose with the handle
of the peeling-knife, and kicked at a venture-
some pig which came rooting amongst the
yam peelings.
“Vio wept as much for rage as for grief,
I’m thinking. But Patoa will give her some-
thing to weep for. I’ve seen him cock his
eye at her more than once, though she had
no thought save for the Sleeper. She’ll have
to cook her taro carefully now, for Pani
looks jealously at her already.”
“See, see. mother!”
It was little Rata’s shrill voice shouting
to his mother. He was pointing upwards
with his spear. Overhead, wheeling and
whirling, flew two black cockatoos, screaming
with rage, fighting as they flew. Tiny black
feathers floated to the ground, and Rata,
gurgling with childish laughter, chased aft n-
them. He gathered the black down in his
small hands, then blew it algain into the air.
“Oh, Ko!” said Mata. “What does that
portend ?”
“The kakapos are mating,” answered her
sister, yawning wearily. “What else?”
Mata picked up a black feather gingerly
between her finger and thumb. “Dost thou
forget that the kakapo is the Sleeper's
totem bird?” she said
solemnly, and bent
down to a withered
old crone who sat
crouching over the fire,
staring fixedly at the
flames as they licked
round the pots. “Gran-
dam !” she shouted in
the old woman’s ear,
thrusting the downy
feather before h v
bleary eyes. “The
kakapos fight ovei-
head, and she pointed to the quarrelling
birds who hung, picking and screaming over
the village street. “What is the omen?”
The old woman raised her shaking white
head, and, shading her eyes with a trembling
bony hand, peered upward. “See where the
blood falls,” she croaked harshly. “There
shall be death,” and she cackled and
mumbled: “Death that lives! Life that
dies ! Death ! The totem brings death !”
and lapsed again into somnolence.
Mata shivered, but Melita sniffed scorn-
fully.
“What can she mean?” said one of the
younger women, nervously pressing her babe
closer to her bosom. “We know that life
dies, but how can death live? Tell me that,
Melita,”
“Grandam gibbers. Death has been and
gone. The old one dotes,” said Melita.
But, all the same, she, too, eagerly watched
the fight.
To and fro the big black birds flapped,
first over one hut
and then over an-
other. Mata tossed
away her scraper
and ran up the
street, following
them, until one
gave a skirl of
pain, and, soaring
over the thatched
roof-tops, dis a p-
peared, swiftly fol-
lowed by the
other.
When Mata
reached Patoa’s
house she stopped
and gasped, for on
the bottom rung of
the ladder lay a
splash of bright red
blood and a tuft
of black down !
Patoa’s wife,
Pani, came to the
doorway. “What
hast thou found
Mata?” she asked
curiously.
“’Tis the kaka-
pos, the totem of
thy house; they
fight overhead,”
and Mata pointed
to the blood-spot.
“’Tis an evil
omen.”
“N onsense!”
said Pani shortly.
“ ’Tis mating time;
that’s all. Come!
Help me with the
pig. ’Tis time we
prepared the feast.
Vio is useless, but
the lazy slut need
not think she can
mourn for ever.
When Patoa re-
turns he will lay a
stick about her
back.”
Mata bent over the prostrate form of the
widow and peeped beneath the pandanus
mat. “She sleeps,” she said softly. “Let
her be. Sleep softens sorrow. I’ll help
thee cook the pig.”
Meanwhile the funeral procession mean-
dered slowly along the road to the burial-
ground. Warupi, the village policeman, im-
portant in his blue-serge jumper and sulu,
marched ahead with his black palm spear to
clear the way, though along the quiet jungle
road there was none to dispute their passage,
save, perhaps, a wandering cassowary or
a solitary bush-pig. The dead man’s brother,
Patoa, walked behind him with old grey-
bearded Taina.
Taina kept up a mumbling grumble.
“This new fashion of burying is no good,”
he said. “In the old days, when a man was
buried beneath his house, his folks could
guard him. 1 like not this burying afar.
Who knows what evil befalls a man s bones t
Thou didst not forget the good stone club,
Patoa? He,” jerking his thumb back over
his shoulder to the litter, "will surely need
it, so far front his village.” _
“The club lies at his. side,” growled Patoa
impatiently. '
Near the little side-track which led to
Loti’s garden the litter-bearers halted.
“Ho ! Warupi! Let us rest awhile, ihe
litter is heavy. Patoa, there are plenty ol
drinking-nuts in the garden. The sleeper
will not begrudge his old friends a drink.
Patoa scowled. “There are plenty ot
nuts in the village,” he said. "Let _us get
on With the burying. We can eat and drink
at our ease when the dead shall be laid
at rest.”
Warupi looked at him beneath shaggy,
grizzled eyebrows, and wagged his head
slowly. "Thou art a loving brother! he
said. “Is it the feast or thy dead brothers
wife which calls to thy belly?”
The litter-bearers laughed! and dropped
their burden heavily at the side of the road,
straightening their cramped shoulders.
“Thou art a lucky man, Patoa,” said one.
“It is not every man who falls heir to a
new house and a young wife. Mostly they
are old and a burden to a man instead of a
joy. I wish thee luck of her. But haste
and bring the nuts. My throat is dry from
last night’s bawling!”
Whilst Warupi and Patoa went off to the
garden, the other men squatted here and
there at the side of the road, and began to
search pouches for a
ch e w of betel-nut.
Lime-gourds were
brought out, and they
chewed and spat and
talked of the fever
which had carried off
Loti in his prime, and
of the luck of Patoa.
Suddenly one sprang
to his feet. “Aie!”
“Loti stood above his brothers motionless body and looked up
at his totem birds with a faint smile on his lips.”
lie yelled, and, pointing with shaking finger
to the litter, bolted into the hush.
The mats on the litter were moving!
As the last man dived into the sheltering
scrub, the mats were flung aside, and Loti,
grey with fright and weakness, sat up and
stared wildly around.
For a while there was silence, broken
only by shouts in the distance. The
bush, towering high, closed in the road on
either side, and arching branches met here
and there overhead. Long-tailed wood-
pigeons cooed softly in the shady trees, and
a bcllbird tolled a melodious note in the
depths of the jungle. The morning sun-
light dappled the track with golden light
and shade. Its rays, flickering through the
leaves, warmed Loti’s cold face. The peace-
ful quiet soothed his fears. Shaking off the
mats, he scrambled from the litter, and,
trembling, staggered to his feet. A ripe
betel-nut lay gleaming yellow in the sun-
light, where one of the bearers had dropped
it in his flight, and Loti eagerly seized upon
it. He tore off the husk, and crunched the
fragrant kernel in his strong, blackened
teeth; then, with a sigh of relief, sank into
the short grass at the foot of a giant okari
tree, and leaned his back against its trunk.
The fever and the coma, in which he had
lain for two days, had left him weak and
dazed, but the betel-nut quickened his dull
brain. By the time the cracking of twigs
and babble of voices told of the men's
return, his eyes had brightened, and he felt
strength return as his sluggish blood began
to flow more quickly through his veins.
Warn pi’s grey head appeared cautiously
from behind a tree, and Patoa peered over
the serge-clad shoulders.
“Warupi! Patoa!” said Loti, rejoiced to
see the faces of friends. “Why am 1 here?”
“Wow ! He speaks!” said a frightened
voice from the rear.
Warupi advanced from his shelter, holding
his spear defensively.
“What fashion is this?” he demanded,
with a quaver of fear in his voice. “Thou
art a dead man, Loti. We take thee to
the burying-ground. Never before have I
seen a dead man sit up and speak.”
“Nor I,” said Patoa, coming out boldly.
“This is a great shame thou hast put upon
us all. Loti. The pig is killed, and the
women cook thy funeral feast.”
The other men ventured out and crowded
round, watching Loti curiously, but ready
to take to the bush if anything untoward
happened.
“This fashion of dying is no good,” said
the** bearer who first ran away. “My belly
is still weak with fright.”
“Better finish dying quickly, Loti, and let
us get on with the burying. My belly calls
for food,” said another.
Loti looked from one , face to another, but.
found no signs of joy at his revival. Their
savage faces showed either resentment at
the fright of disappointment lest- they be
cheated of the funeral feast.
“If the food is cooked,” he said, “we can
go back to the village and eat it.”
“Whoever heard of a dead man eating at
his own funeral feast?” asked Warupi, scan-
(iftliscd.
“Don’t be a fool, brother,” said Patoa. “We
cannot return to Marua with thee. People
would say we were sorcerers who had
brought the dead to life, and they would
shun us. Maybe they would tell the Govern-
ment of us, and we should be gaoled,”
There was a grunt of assent. Some of the
men were swinging hejavy stakes they had
torn from the garden fence. Others fingered
the hafts of their knives. Chests were
beginning to heave, and- eyes were gleaming
bright with hope. \
Loti could see they were licking their
lips in anticipation. It was many a day
since they had seen a killing, and friendship
was drowning in the lust for blood. They
crowded nearer, eyeing him greedily.
“Thou hast already been with the spirits.
Loti. If we take thee back to the village
the spirits will be angry, and then who
knows what may befall us?” quavered Taina.
A shiver of fear shook the crowd, and
sullen voices growled “Truly, Taina! Thou
speakest truly!” -
Patoa was holding Warupi by the sleeve,
whispering urgently in his ear.
Warupi shook his head. “We cannot kill
him here,” he said decidedly, “This is the
Government road. It would be a great
scandal to kill a man on the Government
road. I should have to go to the Station
and tell the Taubada, and it is a long
journey, with trouble for all of us at the
end.”
A sigh of disappointment came from the
crowd. “It would be better if Loti climbed
to the top of this tree and cast himself
down,” suggested Taina.
“Not on the Government road." said
Warupi firmly. “Let us take him to his
garden and leave him with Patoa, so that no
eye can see what shall befall, and no tongue
can then tell the Taubada.”
With a dissenting grumble here and there,
the men finally agreed, two of the elder
men helped Loti to his feet, and slowly
they turned into the track to the garden.
Loti moved reluctantly. Now that the
dazed feeling had gone, his head no longer
felt heavy. The betel-nut had heartened him
and he did not want to die. He thought of
Vio and his little son Rata. He wanted to
hold them in his arms again, hut could see
no way of escape. The, funeral needed a
corpse.
In his well-tended garden the men left him
and Patoa together, with many a regretful
backward look: but Warupi firmly shep-
herded them before him.
Patoa looked round the garden with greedy
eyes. He had no intention of losing such a
treasure. A little grove of betel-nuts and
cocoanut palms; rows of i yams and pine-
apples : clusters of sugar-cane and a patch
of golden corn: promise of many a feast;
with Vio, lovely Vio whom he had always
coveted, to cook it.

Uniformity conserves energy; it ensures the repetition of an act.
Uniformity is the most important essential in golf. Great golfers
are great because they have a uniform swing—they can swing in
the same “groove” every time. With the average set of clubs this
presents difficulties. But not so with Spalding, who have made
every club in the bag feel exactly alike with the “Kro-Flite” Set.
In Spalding clubs the shafts are exactly matched. There is an exact
increase in pitch from one blade to another. There is also an exact
variation in the lie of each club. The distance you stand from the
ball is automatically determined. Such absolute uniformity must bring
greater uniformity to your game.

He licked his dry lips and leered at his
elder brother. “Thou slialt have thy choice,
brother/’ lie said, seating himselt under a
cocoanut palm. <k ßut make haste and choose.
Thou canst either climb the kitidi- tree and
throw thyself down, or I will beat thy head
with this club,” shewing Loti the stone club
which had been placed in the litter for him
to take on his journey to the spirit world.
• Better climb the tree,” he suggested ; and,
leaning back against the bole of the palm,
he leisurely took a betel-nut from his pouch.
“Patoa,” said Loti beseechingly, “I have
been a good brother to thee since our father
died. Hast thou no bowels of pity for me?
Patoa shook his head and crunched the
nut, shovelling lime into his mouth with a
carved spatula which Loti recognised as his
own. “Climb quickly,” he said with his
mouth full.
“Oh, brother,” said Loti, “think of my
young wife. Y’io, a lonely widow!”
“She will not be lonely long, brother,
said Patoa. “I will care for her.”
Loti sighed despairingly. t “But my little
Rata. He will be fatherless.”
“He is no longer fatherless,” said Patoa.
“Last night, at the mourning, Genami, _of
Kupiri, offered me a good armsliell for him.
He goes to Kupiri after thy funeral feast..
Loti goaned and looked at the sky as if
to seek help there. Two black cockatoos came
flying into the palm above Patoa’s head, and,
fluttering, settled in its plumy top. They
flapped their black and scarlet wings, and
picked greedily at the young green nuts, heed-
less of the • men below. He watched them
with tragic eyes.
“See, brother,” he said, pointing to the
birds. “By our totem, the Jcakapo, wilt thou
not spare my life? I know thou hast always
been greedy’ of my goods, though I worked
long years on the plantations to earn them.
I will give thee half. Thou shalt have Melini,
my fat pig.”
“Talk not of Melini,” snarled Patoa
roughly. “I have had to kill her for thy
feast. Make haste and climb. I am weary of
thee,” and he spat out the blood-red saliva
of the betel-nut and stood up, grasping the
club threateningly.
In the crown of the palm the stiff flight-
feathers of a glossy black wing caught against
a ripe brown nut. It tottered on its stem
for a second and then dropped, rustling
through the leaves.
Patoa heard the rustle and glanced up.
Seeing his danger he dodged, but, catching
bis foot in an exposed root, fell asprawl, and
the club rolled from his grasp.
Loti seized his chance. Snatching up the
heavy weapon, and swinging it with all his
feeble might, he brought it down on Patoa’s
thick skull. There was a crack as of a
breaking cooking-pot.
Loti stood above his brother’s motionless
body and looked up at his totem birds with
a faint smile on his lips. He kicked the
fallen nut closer to his brother’s broken head,
and hid the club under a heap of leaves at
the foot of the kinai- tree. Then, sitting
down, he watched the cockatoos feeding,
and thought of Vio.
There was a rumble of voices close at
hand. The birds raised angry crests and
squawked hoarsely. The men were returning.
When Warupi and Taina peered over the
fence the cockatoos left the palm and circled
round and round, screeching their annoyance
at the intruders.
Loti pointed to the circling birds. The
kakapos are angry,” he said. “Our totem
birds have given me leave to live, for they
threw a nut from the palm and killed Patoa.”
There was a hasty scramble over the fence.
Loti gripped the hidden club and waited, his
heart beating rapidly, but ready to fight for
his life.
“Wow! See ! Here’s the nut!” said
Taina. “I said the spirits would not be
satisfied. They sent the totem for Patoa
instead of for thee, Loti. Is it not so?” he
said, turning to the others with a self-satis-
fied smirk. “Did I not foretell truly?” and
none could gainsay him.
“Well, well!” said Warupi. “This is a
strange thing. Never have I known the like
of it. But I suppose one corpse is as good as
another, and Patoa is certainly dead. Bring
the litter and let us get on with the burying.
My belly is as empty as a kapa. Let us
hurry, for if we be overlong the pig will be
spoilt.”
A Scent of Hawthorn.
I dreamt of sunny woods and wild,
Where bluebells kissed my feet,
And primroses and violets smiled
’Neath hawthorn hedges sweet.
And oh ! a lark sang high and high,
A speck against an English sky.
A streamlet bubbled through the grass
Pale cowslip cups to charm;
I saw a tall gamekeeper pass,
His gun beneath his arm;
And pressed behind an aspen tree
He had no passing glimpse of me.
And still he sang, that mad, mad bird!
I woke. Ah, ’twas not he
But rain upon the roof I heard,
And in the almond tree
A whispering and a scent of may
Prom hawthorn half a world away.
QUEENSLAND.
BLACE BONNET.
Invocation.
Come, gentle eve,
And fold me in thy gloaming!
Come, gentle eve,
And sweep the swallows homing!
Silence the land; enmist the wild sea’s
foaming,
Thou slumbrous eve!
Slow, sleepful eve,
Day, night, melt into one;
A tender darkness holding
Dim Earth, her son, with mother arms o’er-
folding—
Ah, restful eve!
Breathe me to sleep
In night’s dark whirl to waken
Where shadows keep
Their watch o’er woods forsaken;
And let me muse, a-tremble, in the deep.

The Trick.
A COMPLETE STORY BY MARCO.
ANNA GLICK stood by her father’s
stall in Jerry’s Markets, selling rib-
bons and lace. She had bright eyes,
a ready smile, a readier tongue, and when I
tell you her waist measured twenty-two
inches you will know she was selling those
ribbons a generation ago. Nowadays, of
course, Anna has no waist. The markets are
still with us, and so are some of the vendors,
and the biggest apples are still in front, but
an ostrich feather would be a ram avis and
a flannel petticoat a curiosity.
Very brisk and busy was Anna, but not
too busy to send over an appraising glance
now and again to young Jacob Abelson, who
had that day moved liis second-hand cloth-
ing stall from the other end of the market
to the space opposite hers. A better position
and nearer the full tide of custom.
Anna could never have been even a run-
ner-up in a beauty competition; but, as I
have "shown, she had her attractions, and
there were many youths who would have
been flattered by her regard. Yet she might
have been Chinese Joe. the herbalist, for
all the notice Jacob Abelson took of her,
so completely occupied was he with the busi-
ness of putting out the wares attractively,
brushing up and angling for buyers. Not so
many during the day—-it is in the late after-
noon and evening that the volume of trade is
done in Jerry’s Markets.
Round about five o’clock Anna had finished
serving a customer with lace insertion. It
came to two shillings, but as the woman
tendered the coin it fell from her hand and
rolled under Abelson’s stall. “Now ain’t I
.the butter-fingers!” she cried. “It doesn’t
matter,” said Anna; “I’ll get it after.”
“Right you are, dearie, you ain’t so fat as
me,” the woman cried out with a laugh and
went aw y ay, and Anna turned to the next
customer.
Out of the corner of her eye she saw Abel-
son dive under his stall and retrieve the
coin. If she expected him to bring it to her
she was disappointed, so after waiting a
while she went over to his stall.
“I’ll trouble you to hand over the two-
shilling bit that lady dropped,” she said.
“I don’t know anything about no two shil-
lings,” answered Jacob.
“You can’t kid me—l saw you pick it up.”
“Supposin’ I tell you it wasn’t a two-
shilling bit?”
“Then I’d tell you you’re a liar.”
Jacob said no more, but Anna wasn’t
finished; with a snap in her eyes and voice
she gave her undiluted opinion of gilt-
fressers who would rob blind men’s dogs and
children’s money-boxes if they had half a
chance, and after spitting eloquently, if
inelegantly, in the dust of the markets, she
went back to her own stall. Nevermore
was Jacob unaware of Anna. It was he
who now sent glances across, but Anna did
not look his way. When she was not serving
she turned her back on him. The feller
Abelson had shown her a point and she de-
spised lies —paltry ones that is, not to be
confounded with those good honest lies neces-
sary in business.
Jacob cast about for an excuse to speak
to Anna again. At one time he required
change, but felt that to ask for it would be
an unpropitious opening. But when it drew
near closing time lie went across. Jacob
could look a customer squarely in the face
and tell her the dress he was offering was
made in Bond-street, London, and it was
only through a death in the Governor-
General’s family it came into his possession.
He could sell a dress-suit that was more
moth-holes than material. But his glib
tongue might have be.en pickled when he
faced this bit of a girl.
Anna ignored him at first, then after a
few seconds turned on him sharply. “No
use hanging round here, my good fellow,’’
she said —“I’ve given the remnants away.”
“I thought”
“There’s no more money rolling round to
pick up.”
“I thought I could help you pack up your
stall.”
“When my right arm’s paralysed and my
left’s in a sling I’ll come to you for help.”
Jacob retired to his own terrain and
watched Anna dismantle her stall. He hoped
to see arrogance punished when the heavy
bars proved unmanageable, but Anna was
deft and strong, and packing up was all in
her day’s work.
Yet Jacob was still eager to get on a
better footing. He was sorry about the two
shillings. It was up to him to make Anna
forget it. But she repulsed his timid
advances with persiflage and worse. When
a customer was picking up her change care-
lessly, Anna would call out in an unneces-
sarily loud voice: “Be careful, if you drop
anything here you’ll never see it again.”
One day Detective Mulligan strolled through
the markets. He stopped a moment at
Anna’s stall. “Ah. Miss Glick. making
your little pile?” “If it’s the little pile of
empty boxes you mean, I am. And what
are yon doing hereabouts?” Mulligan leaned
towards her confidentially. “There’s been a
lot of complaints lately of pickpockets, so

I'm watching for crooks from outside.”
Jacob's sallow face burnt brick red as Anna
declared: “Well, there’s some tricky ones
inside, Sarge, might pay you to watch.”
But there is a time limit to the punish-
ment of the gravest crimes, and presently
Anna ceased being hostile and became merely
indifferent. To cure that unfriendliness
was Jacob’s problem. He triod simple
remedies. One morning when Anna left her
plaee for a few moments, Jacob, greatly
daring, got an ice-cream from the soda foun-
tain near the door and placed it on her stall.
He turned round to find liis young sister
Fanny grinning at him. Very brusquely he
sent her away, and Fanny was spared the
pain of seeing a perfectly good ice-cream
thrown into the gutter. But she had a
grievance, which she nursed. She had run
to the markets fit to break her neck with
her brother’s dinner, and all she got was sour
looks and hard words. Jacob could buy ice-
creams for that scratch-cat Anna Glick.
Slic'd show him.
Mrs. Abelson had suffered in her youth at
the hands of a spiteful officious sister. In
memory thereof her children were not allowed
to tell tales against each other. There was
no rule, however, about singing them. So
as Fanny laid the table she shrilled in a
high falsetto: “Jacob bought Anna Glick an
i-c-e-cream tra-la-la. Bread —a big pink six-
penny i-c-e-cream tralala. Knives. And he
told me to hop off, Mother. Pepper trala-
lala,”
If Mrs. Abelson heard she took no notice,
but next day she said to her husband: “Our
Jacob buys sixpenny ice-creams for Anna
Glick.”
“Veil, young men vill trow der money
about. Better dat den putting it on horses.”
“Ice-creams is, vaste and foolishness, but
I’d sooner it be Anna Glick as anyone else.”
“She’s a shoiri maidel.”
“I don't know nothing about dat. She’s
got a good business kop. If Jacob had been
a vatchmaker like I vanted, I might have
made a good match for him : but vat could
I do vith a second-hand son?”
At the time Jacob had started to fend for
himself Mr. Abelson. senior, was a journey-
man watchmaker. Mrs. Abelson had hoped
her son wpuld follow his father's trade. “Vith
Zefcel’s skill and Jacob’s brains together they
should make a fine business,” she argued. But
Jacob, excellent son though lie was, never
furthered her ambi-
tion. He loathed
tli e watchmaking
and all its works.
Not on clock pin-
ions would lie ever
soar to fortune.
Moreover, lie had
no intention of
passing his days
with arneye screwe.l
to a magnifying-
glass. He could put
that eye to better
use.
“It's time you
vos married, Jacob,
and getting a fam-
i 1 y,” said his
mother. “Und Anna
Glick suits me bet-
ter den most girls.
She ain’t so mer-
shugger vith der
dancing and pic-
tures and oder rub-
bish, so J am going
round to see what marriage portion Nathan
Glick is giving his gel.”
Jacob tingled as he conjured lip an image
of Anna’s scorn should such a proposition be
put to her. “Don’t you do nothing of the
sort,” lie cried angrily. “You ain’t in Russia
now. Parents don’t make the marriages for
their children in this country, Mother. Be-
sides,” he added to clinch the argument,
“Anna Glick ain’t to my taste.”
Watching Anna slyly throughout the day,
Jacob knew she was very much to liis taste;
even a certain tartness of tongue gave her an
added piquancy. Nevertheless it took two
more market days to convince him that life
without Anna would have as much savor as
a dish of bicklings without vinegar.
But what to do? He was too diffident to
make any more overtures of peace and good-
will. And so communing he thought of Alec
Lindsay, who was Abey Lutski when he and
Jacob were schoolmates. Possessing entirely
different temperaments, they had been firm
pals. Jacob admired the other boy’s dash
and confidence, and Abey liked Jacob almost
as well as the strudel and buttercakes Mrs.
Abe Ison packed in his lunch-bag. lie was
now doing well as a real-estate agent. Alec
concerned with his building lots and Jacob
with his job lots were both ambitious young
men. both determined to do well and never
be done. There resemblance ended. Jacob
was interested in ladies’ attire, but—with on l
exception—not at all in the wearers. Alec’s
regard embraced both. He was wholly a
ladies’ main. “The sort of chap the girls
wouldn’t leave alone. If he wanted an even-
ing off they would be ’phoning and coming
for Mm.’*- lie said it himself, and Jacob
never doubted him.
Who better to give him some points than
Alee?
Jacob called at his place one evening,
timing to catch him after tea and before
the girls could capture him.
Jacob put the case of one George, a friend.
George fancied a young lady, but didn’t seem
to bo getting solid with her, and he wished
he could find out where he stood.
Alec dismissed “George” without any re-
ference. “Easy as flying,” he assured Jacob.
“If you’re the fish she wants to land she'll
throw you a line. But first be sure the
track’s clear and you’re not barking up the
wrong tree.” Alec mixed his metaphors as
carelessly as he did his drinks, but for all
that he gave Jacob much good advice allegedly
drawn from his own wide experiences. He
favored a bold policy. A little flattery, for
instance, would not be amiss.
“She ain’t that sort of girl.”
“Any sort of girl is,” Alec replied deci-
sively, and Jacob resolved to follow his
friend’s advice —if he could.
The following Friday, when Anna was
arranging her rolls of ribbon during a lull
in trade, Jacob came behind her and whis-
pered in her ear “Peacliblow.” He had seen
the word somewhere, and it sounded good.
The lady turned upon him. “Flyblow!”
she corrected, and followed this with a re-
quest that Jacob would stop staring at her
all day, as she wasn't the bearded lady.
Jacob felt that if Anna had thrown him a
line he had caught the hook.
“A king can look at a cat,” he stam-
mered, and then could have bitten his tongue
out for his blunder.
But the effect on Anna was magical. Her
rather wide mouth opened and her nose
crinkled up and she laughed—yes, laughed.
“Well, now, who’d have thought you was
such a trick? A king can look at a cat!
That’s a good one.”
Jacob was too astute to spoil the advance
in favor and prudently retired.
Anna approached him soon afterwards. “1
was thinking maybe you’d like to come to
the motzo bakers’ picnic on Sunday,” she
said. “There’s such a lot more girls than
fellers anything in trousers is welcome.”
The form of invitation might have irked
a proud spirit, but Jacob only saw an oppor-
tunity to grasp. “Be bold,” said the oracle ;
so Jacob, assuming boldness though he had
it not, accepted, on the condition that Anna
was his partner for the day. Declaring that
some people wasn’t lost for it, Anna went
away again.
It was getting late; most of the stall-
holders had gone home. Along came Sam
Brophy, who had the fern and palm stand at
the far end. Something had ruffled Sam.
“What d’yer know about this?” lie said
to Jacob. “Me, Sam Brophy, done in the
eye by a fat old cow of a twister. She picks
over the best asperdustcrs, pulls out me
haresfoot to see if the roots is there, then
beats me_ down to two-bob and pays me
with this.” Sam held on his palm a metal
disc, very like a florin, with milled edges,
but in place of the usual remarks about
Georgius Y.D.G., round the edge was
an intimation that Hogarths made ninety-
nine varieties. On tin* obverse side was a
pickle-jar with two gherkins rampant; on
the reverse a face, mostly a broad grin, the
partaker presumably of the ninety-nine
varieties.
“How comes you took it?” Anna was
asking.
“Me? I never.
She portends she’s
dropped it, says
‘You’re not so fat
as me, dearie,’ and
by the time I pick
it up and savvy
what it is she’s
vanished. Yes, you
can laugh she
didn’t drop any
burn ’arf dollars on
you.”
Jacob rummaged
in a box of odd-
ments and brought
forth a disc simi-
lar to Sam’s, but
Brophy had passed
out.
A contrite Anna
turned to Jacob.
“Come back all I
said about the two
shillings,” she said
thoughtfully. “I'll
take you for my
partner at the picnic if you want.”
Jacob repeated the formula “Be bold.”
“What about you and me having a picnic
Sunday on our own, Anna?” he asked.
“If we go out the two of us alone,” Anna
suggested, “people will be putting our names
together.”
“Well, supposin’.”
“Your mother was round at our place,”
said Anna, not irrelevantly.
“Oh,” said Jacob uneasily.
“I don’t want no matches made for me,”
declared Anna.
“No, nor me,” countered Jacob.
“Well we’re both of us on one mind,
anyway.”
Anna was turning away but Jacob caught
her arm. “Let’s make tip our own, Anna.”
"Because his mother says so?”
“Nothing to do with Mother. You’re the
girl I want.”
“Sure?” asked Anna softly.
“Positive. Why, I’d choose you out of” —
here .Jacob stuck, but an object, on the
ground caught his eye—“ninety-nine varie-
ties,”, lie ended brightly.
Anna’s laugh echoed through the deserted
markets. “Yell, you are a trick, Jacob.”
And so Jacob knew.
Twilight Sounds.
Hoard along the creek
When the .shadows fall
At the end of day,
And the twilight grey
Steals across the hills,
Is the plover’s call.
Unto him who strays
On the cattle trail,
Winding through the rank
Tufts that clothe the hank
Of the prattling creek,
Comes the curlew’s wail.
Heard, too, is the voice
Of a gentle breeze
As it passes through
Fronds new-bathed with dew,
And tin* drooping leaves
Of tall ereekside trees.
But the sound that most
Lends the twilight charm
Is the song of men
Riding home again
From far mustering
To the hillside farm.
