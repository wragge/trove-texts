The Red Page
1914
The examiner’s report on the examina-
tions held in Australian literature of 1914
is as follows: —•
Fiction.
There were 28 competitors in this section,
including two non-competitive entries from
the staff, A Journalist and Two Bears, by
James Edmond, and The Knight of the
Motor Launch, by Arthur 11. Adams. In
the romance sub-section the only commended
entries were: Where Bonds are Loosed, by
E. L. Grant .Watson, Kerno: A Stone, by
Tarella Quin, and Two’s Company, by Doro-
thea Mackellar and Ruth Bedford; but the
quality of this section did not justify any prize.
Fair papers were submitted as follow: Bar-
bara Holliday, by Marion Miller Knowles;
A Rebel of the Bush, by Don Delaney; On
His Majesty’s Service, and The Fugitive, by
Roy Bridges; A Bachelor’s Wife, by M.
Forrest. The examiner, however, saw no
hope for Australian literature in any of
these names.
In the humor sub-section, Spat’s Fact’ry,
by Edward Dyson, was the only commend-
able entry, but in humor, one of our great
natural industries, 1914 has shown a deplor-
able slump. In the flapperature section,
however, a comparatively high level of pro-
duction was maintained. Flower o’ the Bush,
by Marion Downes ; Mona’s Mystery Man, by
Vera G. Dwyer; Gray’s Hollow, by Mary
Grant Bruce; The Girl from the Backblocks,
by Lilian Turner were the best, though here,
too, no prize could be offered.
Biography.
The subjects chosen by the competitors for
biographical treatment included: Sappho,
by T. G. Tucker; Bill: A Bushman, by
Charles 11. S. Matthews; and Flinders, by
Ernest Scott. The Life of Captain Matthew
Flinders was awarded the first prize, the
examiner regarding this work as one of the
great biographies of English literature.
History.
The entries were: Some Early Records of
the Macarthurs of Camden, by Sibella Mac-
arthur Onslow; The University of Sydney,
by Robt. A. Dallen; Historical Records of
Australia and The Beginnings of Govern-
ment in Australia, both by Fredk. Watson;
and Eureka: Freedom’s Fight of ’54, by R.
S. Ross. No award was made, nor merited,
since in the Macarthur and in Fredk. Wat-
son’s publications there were merely the bare
bones of history, unclothed, in Fredk. Wat-
son’s case, even with grammar.
Description.
This class was divided into two sections;
Our Own Country and the Other Bloke’s
Country. In the former sectionv C. E.
Jacomb’s God’s Own Country was disquali-
fied for incorrigible untruthfulness; Out-
back in Australia, by Walter Kilroy Harris,
did not get sufficiently far outback; The
Gumsucker at Home, by N. F. Spielvogel,
was commended for its Australian tone and
knowledge of, at least, one small section of
the continent. In the second section, The
Dutch East, by J. Macmillan Brown, proved
an interesting work; so, too, did With Other
Races, by Aaron Hoskin; but neither was
as exhilaratingly Australian as Randolph
Bedford’s Explorations in Civilisation, which
carried off the prize.
Drama.
Only two books of plays were entered, The
Rose of Ravenna, by Edward A. Vidler; and
Three Plays for the Australian Stage, by
Arthur H. Adams, the latter being non-
competitive.
Theology and Anti-Theology.
A small section, of which the best was
Frank W. Boreham’s Mountains in the Mist.
Science.
The entries, by J. H. Maiden, of works
dealing with.. our Forest Flora, parts of a
vast conception slowly reaching maturity,
were commended. Various works dealing
with agriculture were—-agricultural. Flor-
ence Sulman and A. E. Sulman produced
books dealing admirably with our wild
flowers. . Donald E. Frazer offered some
stimulating Thoughts for Teachers, and T.
G. Tucker some dull philological Monologues.
R. R. S. MacKinnon had some fresh theories
about The Vital Spark that still await con-
clusive proof. Baldwin Spencer’s The
Native Tribes of the Northern Territory of
Australia was the sort of work that only this
scientist could produce, and only he could
produce so admirably. The first prize in
this section was awarded to him. The
second went to R. F. Irvine, for his icono-
clastic argument as to The Place of Social
Sciences in a Modern University. The third
was awarded to Robert Kaleski’s Australian
Barkers and Biters, with Edward S. Soren-
son’s Friends and Foes in the Australian
Bush a good fourth.
Art.
excellent entries. Cartoons, by
Will Dyson, carried off the first prize;
Ure Smith’s Relics of Old
tolonml Days, and Harry J. Weston’s All’s
well with the Fleet were strenuous com-
petitors.
Sport.
No award was made in this small class,
a A con }Petitors being Malcom Ross’s
A timber in New Zealand, and C. A.
Jeffries Famous Fights at the Stadium.
Verse.
This was the largest class examined, and a
large proportion made up the “Bellerive”
section. There was, however, no competitor
wno was really Bellerivean enough to deserve
prize. The Rolled Gold Poetry class made
a good showing, but no particular poet could
be honored for the brilliance of his brumrni-
ness. Rosycheeks and Golden-Head, by
Ruth M. Bedford, deserved mention as the
best in the Kiddie-Verse section. In the
poetry class J. J. Malone, for his fresh Wild-
Briar and Wattle-Blossom; Iv.M.H.S., for
his brilliant but uneven Verses, and Will
Lawson, for his interesting but traditiohal
and too diffuse collection, The Three Kings
and 0.V., deserve mention. Of these three
K.M.ILS. promises most for the future.
C. J. Brennan, bearing his colossal volume of
poetry, arrived at the examination hall too
late, in the dying hours of last year; but he
is invited to sit for the 1915 examination,
when his tremendous contribution will receive
careful consideration. An unofficial dip into
his Poems indicated a generous contribution
to Australian poetry. The first prize for
1914 verse was awarded to Archibald T.
Strong, for his brilliant translations of The
Ballades of Theodore de Banville; the second
went to Dorothea Mackellar, for her collected
The Witch-Maid and Q.V.
The examiner suggests that the following
papers should be added to the permanent
Bulletin Bookshelf:—
The Life of Captain Mattheio Flinders, by
Ernest Scott.
The Native Tribes of the Northern Terri-
tory of Australia, by Baldwin Spencer.
The Ballades of Theodore de Banville, by
Archibald T. Strong.
The Witch-Maid and Other Verses, by
Dorothea Mackellar.
No less than 101 Australian publications
(excluding serial parts of works like those of
C. J. Maiden) were submitted for examina-
tion during 1914—practically two works of
Australian origin were produced every week.
Verses by Will Lawson
LOOKIN’ OUT.
Fm a sailor-man, and Em lookin’ out
For somethin’ over the sea —~
(It might be a whale or a waterspout).
I’m a sort of foragin’ advance scout,
Turnin’ around and walkin’ about
When the officer’s watchin' me.
One of these nights I s’pose I’ll see
Somethin’ to recompense —
Some sword-fish havin’ a sewin’-bee,
Fillin’ themselves with cake and tea;
Or a bull-whale full of prosperity
Buildin ’ a boundary fence.
I’m lookin’ into a wall of night
With nothin’ to see but dark —
O’ course I’m searchin ’ for breakers white,
And watchin' to see that they steer her right,
With the oil run lord in the starboard light,
And the port light cold and stark.
I’ve been workin' a winch for the whole dam?
day,
And there’s nothin’ to see put there;
I’ve been lookin’ for years, and all I say
Is, “Don’t you worry your life away,
Watchin ’ for things that only may
Appear on the midnight air.”
Every time they strike the bell
I turn to the bridge and shout,
“Lights are burnin’, and all is well” —-
There are stars in Heaven and flames in
Hell,
And it seems a deliberate lie to tell,
When I know the port light’s out.
I’m a sailor-iman who is swivel-eyed, -
And I’m blind as a bat by day,
I couldn’t see in the dark if I tried,
But the sea ain’t quite so deep as it’s wide,
And there’s many whose lives would be sim-
plified,
If she dropped where the mud-crabs play.
“Four bells! and lights a-burning bright” —
(The port light’s cold and stark),
On the starboard bow there’s a steamer light,
And there’s nothin’ to see besides but Night;
All’s well — we’re guessin’ our way all right,
Gropin’ our way in the dark.
LADIES IN THE ENGINE-ROOM.
Let’s stand bach here by the boilers —
Watch ’em through the open door,
Trippin ’ round with shoe-heels tappin’
On the noisy, iron floor.
Mine’s the small ’un with the giggle,
(Pointin’ like a semyphore).
See the “chief,” all teeth and whiskers,
Showin’ ’em the way she goes.
(What about that one that’s solemn,
With the cunnin'-looking nose?)
Hear their packin’ swishin’! swishin’!
What a blessed lot of clothes!....
Now they’re goin’ down the tunnel.
(Mine’s the little 'un as yet —
Makes good steamin’, pretty motion;
Keeps her coal bill down, I bet.)
Ain’t the__ chaperong a monster?
She’ll drive through it — drippin ’ wet.
Now they’ve stopped, and Mac is tellin’
How the Yank was killed, last year
When his pants caught in the shaftin’,
Kind of cloth that wouldn’t tear.
Yankee Bill, lie went to glory —
That was Yankee Bill’s affair.
Wish the “chief” would tell ’em other
Yarns about the flamin’ things —
Tell ’em what we got to hang to
When we’re oilin’ and she swings —
How it’s lovely in the tunnel
When the shaftin’ bends and springs.
Never mind! T'hey’re only women!
Very likely good, ’uns, too —
And they’ll never rightly savvy
What ns hothouse blossoms do —
Real good women —proper women —
Much too good for me and you.
“Yes, sir! Yes’m! them’s the boilers —
Double-ended boilers, mum.
When we’re goin’? Yes, it’s sultry.
Yes, at times we do sweat some.
Have to stoop here—them’s the bunkers;
Through here’s where the trimmers
come.
“No, miss! No, it never hurts us —
Easy sort of work for men.”
(Seems to want to ask me questions)
“Men get scalded? Now and then.
Wouldn’t do for uou to try it —
Might feel faint-like now’n’ again.”
Tired of lookin’ at the boilers,
They stepped dainty through the door,
And I hear the shoes a-clickin’,
On the soundin’ iron floor.
And their patent packin’ swishin’ —
Only hope there ain’t no more!
Fr:om “The Three Kings and 0.V.”
The trouble with Will Lawson, author of
The Three Kings and O.V. (Angus and
Robertson, 2s. 6d.) is that he writes too
easily. With a gift of facile phrase, with-
out much care for conciseness of expression,
he rambles on, content to end in an anti-
climax, painting a picture in which there
are too many niggling strokes, a vague
picture without, a frame. His inspiration
is largely derivative, though his interest in
his subjects—ships and sailormen, locomo-
tives and drivers—-is genuine. A cheerful
sea-humor is his most valuable asset; his
tragedy and pathos suffer from over-much
dilution ; and his society verse is technically
clever but thin. He carries on a tradition
of Australian verse that worked itself out
a decade ago, carries it on worthily ; though
he does it as well as his forerunners, the
method has staled, leaving him rather a
survivor than a disciple. Yet, for sailor-
man and engineer, his book will be a
cherished possession. For the ordinary
verse-reader there is too much of: —
Oh! we’re greasin’, greasin’, greasin’,
But there’s hearts above, I know,
That’s as bitter and as burnin’,
And as full of hopeless yearnin’
As the hearts that beat below;
And thev know no rest or easin’,
Like them tail-rods swingin’ so.
That is all a little obvious, without the
economy of means and the pregnant phrase
possessed by the originator of this method.
Yet Will Lawson has his own note in such
vigorous pictures of “The Cattle-Boats” as
these: —
When God made out His shippin’-notes,
And sent this world to sea,
He must have missed the cattle-boats
And cattle-men like me.
He meant all farms to be ashore,
Not sailin’ full and by,
With chokin’ bullocks sweatin’ gore
And layin’ down to die.
He didn’t authorise that hells
Should wander on His seas....
We ships ’em at the River Plate,
And from the States they come
With bleedin’ horns and starin’ hate—
Thank God, the brutes are dumb!
And when the Maoriland nostalgia grips
him, as in “The Adventurer” and “The
Old Ngahauranga Road,” his emotion
marches valiantly with his metre.
Then, though Australia’s beauty
Has cast on him her spell,
He’ll turn to the New Zealand hills
That he has loved so well.
Here is his Great Adventure,
Here wide world-music streams.
But, oh, those hills,
He knows those hills!
He sees them in his dreams—
Green slopes, that dip so steeply,
Down to the lines of foam —-
Bare peaks that are as beacons
To guide the petrels home.
A Lesson in Spelling
A gentleman from Hog Hill, Winchelsea,
England—to what remote waste places The
Bulletin penetrates!—is moved to correct
our spelling. He forwards the following
list of what he conceives to be errors. As
he does not give page references by which
we could check his accusations of errors, we
are willing to accept his statements and
humbly acknowledge our faults, where they
are faults.
I regret to see that although your diction is in
the main so independent and virile, you still follow
too much the mannerisms and affectations of Cockney
journalism. Among various instances of this I have
lately noticed the following: “Vendor” for vender,
“nett” for net, “guerilla” for guerrilla (skirmish),
or rather guerrillero (skirmisher), “egotist” for
egoist (why not “egonist” like tobacconist?),
“mediaeval” for medieval, “Esquimau” for Eskimo,
“to a degree” for to a high or considerable degree
(for every qualification must have a degree), “nom
de plume” for pen-name, “an heroic” for a heroic
(you write a habitual), “cognoscenti” for conoscenti,
“fiance6” for fiancee (correct Fr. fianeSe), “musee”
for musee, “Scheldt” for Schelde (like “veldt” for
veld), “naif” for naive, “en deshabille” for en
dfishabille, “imbecility” for imbecillity (compare
bacillus).
You even have some errors which are seldom
found even in ; British papers. Thus “laid low” for
lay low, “calliosities” for callosities, “typiste” for
typist, and among foreign words “liber Himmel” for
lieber Himmel, “lieberwurst” for Leberwurst, “Freid-
rich” (several times) for Friedrich, “Kamschatka”
for Kamchatka (Kamtschatka is the German method
of spelling). Also, you persist in writing “by-and-
bye” for by-and-by (bye is a noun), and “verandah”
for veranda (though ’ 'you have corrected pa for
“pah”).
I also regret to see “camaraderie,” “raconteur” for
comradery, recounter; “clientele,” to which the near-
est English pronunciation is “cleeongtail” for clientele
or clientage. Even lawyers talk of their clients not
their “cleeongs.” Why not, therefore, the equally
good and established clientele? Your paper is. far
too good for such petty and snobbish affectations.
Also, debris, prestige, attachee, habituee, aide-camp,
etc., should be anglicized in spelling and sound.
[lt looks a formidable indictment; but, dissected,
it resolves itself into a mere personal expression of
Hog Hill opinion, against which we offer ours. Our
authority in this dispute is the Concise Oxford Dic-
tionary. published by the Oxford University, adapted
from the great Oxford English Dictionary, now pon-
derously approaching completion—the final word on
spelling. Both Oxford and Hog Hill are in the
same country, and Oxford authority is usually pre-
ferred to that of Hog Hill. The spelling in the
Concise Dictionary is, for the most part, that of
the O.E.D. The C.O.D. gives “vendor” and “vender,
the former for legal, the latter for ordinary, use.
On the general question “-or” or “-er” it states that
“-or” has been displaced by “-er” in some words, as
“barber,” and had displaced it in others, as “sailor.’
“Nett” is a mistake. “Guerrilla” is given as
•‘guer(r)illa,” showing that the C.O.D. leans to our
practice of omitting unnecessarily doubled consonants.
“Egotist” is as valid as “egoist,” though the latter
is derivatively more correct. If we spelt medieval
“mediaeval” that is a departure from our practice of
omitting useless diphthongs. According to the
C.0.D., both “Esquimaux” and “Eskimo” are cor-
rect, despite Hog Hill’s contention. “To a degree”
is admitted, in a colloquial sense, by the C.O.D.
And we frequently use “pen-name.” The modern
practice is to write “a heroic,” “a habitukl,” though
this usage is comparatively new. In the modernisa-
tion of the language this rather charming usage of
an “an” before an unaccented h seems doomed as
pedantic. It is more euphonious, however, in verse.
Hog Hill’s new word “conoscenti” is not mentioned
in the C.0.D.; but other words like “recognise”
show that if the word is Englished the g should be
pronounced, and if pronounced, written. The mis-
placing of the accents in “musSe” and fiancee” are
obviously printer’s errors. There is no rule as to
the spelling of foreign place names. The only thing
we can do is to follow the maps,' and the maps don’t
follow each other. “Naif” is marked (rare). We
spell “naive,” though as the word is now English,
the diaeresis might conveniently be dropped. Hog
Hill apparently wants to retain it. The omission
of accents, as in “deshabillO,” is due, in many in-
stances, though not in this paper, to the fact that
many modern founts lack accented letters. Hog Hill
is in error in wanting to spell imbecility “imbecil-
lity.” A man can be “laid low,” or he can state
that he “lay low.” Hog Hill does not state in
which sense the term was used. “Calliosities” is
probably another printer’s error. We use the Fr.
“typiste” as a labor-saving method of indicating a
female manipulator of a typewriting machine. The
male operator is a typist. The spelling of foreign
names and words is a reader’s or a printer’s error.
If Hog Hill went to press as hurriedly as we do he
would sympathise. Both “by the bye” and “by the
by” are allowed by the C.O.D. So “verandah” is ■
given both with and without the h. The question
of “camaraderie,” etc., is merely whether one re-
gards the word as French or as Englished.]
So Hog Hill has merely pointed out some
printer’s erros, and in his long list of com-
plaints only in three instances is he’ sup-
ported by the Concise Oxford Dictionary.
We spelt “net” and “medieval” wrong, and
we still stick to the tradition of using an
“an” before an unaccented h. It is evident
that Hog Hill had better bring out a Concise
Hog Hill Dictionary before butting in again.
Australia’s First Naval Fight (George
Robertson, Is.) is an illustrated pamphlet
telling in vigorous language the story of the
Sydney’s victory over the Emden. The
account is necessarily incomplete, since the
naval authorities have not given us full par-
ticulars of the events leading up to the
action. The planning of the coup will
probably prove more interesting than its
result.
Recent war publications include two four.-,
penny pamphlets published by the Patriotic
Publishing Co., London: Hoio the War Came
About, written by J. Holland Rose for “the
young people,” and Britain’s Duty To-Day,
by Edward Lyttleton, addressed to the bloke-
in-the-street, advocating “compulsory service,
not conscription,” on the Swiss system—or
he might have said, the Australian system,
had this head-master of Eton chanced to
remember this negligible continent.
“R. P. Ayman”: The correspondent critic, “E.J.H.”
(Red Page 17/12/’l4>, of your review of McCabe’s
Bernard Shaw displays the habit of “sweeping
generalisations unsupported by any evidence”
of which he accuses, McCabe. McCabe’s
statement that the overwhelming majority of
biologists reject vitalism stands good in the face
of only seven biologists, who accept it according to
“E.J.H.” ; and at least one of the seven, Lodge, for
instance, is not a biologist. “E.J.H.’s” generalisation
that Rationalists are uncritical and credulous, un-
supported by any evidence, is merely abusive. To
say that Rationalists are anti-Rationalists is but a
cheap sort of Shavian verbal paradox.
The latest batch of the “Home University
Library” (Is.) is historical. The Ancient
East, a History of Scotland, An Outline of
Russian Literature, by Maurice Baring, and
The Wars Between England and America
promise interest.
Local war publications include The Call of the
Blood, and Other I Var Verses, by “Rose de Boheme”
(Sydney Lyceum Club; 6d.), which calls the Kaiser
“Imperator! Violator! Devastator! Desecrator!” and
other unpleasant things, and has a “Song of the
Red Cross” something like this: —
Sobbing,
Robbing
Hearts of rest and eyes Of sleep,
Visions daunt us,
Clutch us, haunt us,
Of the lads who vigil keep;
Lads who bear for ms the brunt
At the Front! At the Front!
and other emotions just as patriotically jumpy.
Another effort calculated to bring the war to a
sudden close is Helen Truran Hohne’s price three-
pence De Kaiser: —
De Kaiser, de Kaiser, the ruler of all nations,
Oh, Kaiser, de Kaiser, to fool the people’s patience,
He whacks his mo’, he stands just so!
He says he’s God Almighty, the imps of Hell sur-
round him well.
And he is Satan’s flunkey.
Music may be had on application to 63 Brunning-
street, St. Kilda.

well as several OTHER STYLES
RAZORS, there is a NEW BLADE 1
of the week. In the LIST that follows we quote a
SELECTION, and offer them at
ANTHONY HORDERNS’
FAMOUS LOW PRICES.
GEM JUNIOR SAFETY RAZOR.
The GEM JUNIOR SAFETY RAZOR solves the
problem for the man who cannot rely upon the old-
style Razor. It is unequalled for easy and luxurious
Shaving, and does not scrape nor pull.
The GEM JUNIOR SAFETY RAZOR, with the
New Bar, adds still further to the EFFICIENCY
of this popular Safety Razor. THE GEM JUNIOR
provides a KEEN BLADE for EVERY day in the week.
Every Blade automatically adjusts itself, and as the
BLADE does the shaving it is the first consideration.
GEM JUNIOR BLADES are made from the best
Razor Steel, tempered by a process, patented by the
Gem Cutlery Co. (the oldest makers of Safety
Razors), that provides a keen, lasting edge.
After using GEM JUNIOR BLADES several times
they may be stropped—the steel is superior, the
temper 1 and edge so line that stropping makes them
as good as ever.
The New Bar smoothes out the creases of the skin,
raises the beard just ahead of the cutting edge, and
makes perfect shaving a simple matter.
The GEM JUNIOR SAFETY RAZOR is made and
finished in the BEST STYLE, of the BEST materials,
and by the best workmanship. It comprises Nickel-
plated Frame, extra handle for Stropping Blades, and
Seven KEEN-EDGED BLADES, packed in neat case.

DURHAM DEMONSTRATOR OUTFIT.
The phenomenal popularity of the DURHAM
DUPLEX SAFETY RAZOR, sold the world over for
21 /- lias led to the introduction of
THE DURHAM DEMONSTRATOR.
The Razor is made specially for DURHAM
DUPLEX BLADES, and, except for the handle, is
identical with the high-grade Duplex.
The DURHAM DEMONSTRATOR, like the Durham
Duplex, incorporates the best points of the old-
style Razor, and the advantages of the safety guard
aiid interchangeable Blades.
The DURHAM DEMONSTRATOR RAZOR affords
the correct sliding diagonal stroke, together with a
safety guard and interchangeable blades, and, there-
fore, enables you to shave correctly and with safety.
It does not cut vou—neither does it scrape or pull.
DURHAM DUPLEX BLADES are manufactured of
the finest carbonised steel, correctly tempered, ground
on two edges, and perfectly honed and stropped. The
blades may be stropped by using the blade-holder
attachment. AVhen a "blade loses its keenness, strop it,
or use a new one.

prising Silver-plated Set, consisting of Razor, Safety
guard, Stropping Attachment, and six Double-edged
Hollow-ground Durham Duplex Blades of finest tem-
pered steel.

are triple silverplated, and the toothless guard is
easily cleaned.
THE REVO is a boon to travellers, and the latest
product in the world of Safety Razors incorporating
improved features, which automatcally give the sliding
stroke angle.
REVO BLADES are hand-stropped and hollow-
ground Norway Steel, converted into blades by a
process which ensures a keen, lasting edge.
REVO BLADES may be stropped time and again.

with the patent, high-speed machine specially designed
for Safety Razors. It sharpens any thin, Safety
Razor Blade.

Your Tongue never fails
to tell you when your system is out of order. Look
now and see if it is thick, creamy-coated. This is the
sign the Doctor always looks for when he suspects
biliousness or a disordered stomach, and were you to
ask his advice he would most probably tell you that
the best remedy is Cockle’s Antibilious Pills, which
are made according to the prescription of a famous
English Doctor.
Cockle’s Pills
A REPUTATION OF OVER 100 YEARS.
Never advocated as a panacea for all ills, but for those
occasions when you don’t feel quite “ up to the mark”;
when you feel drowsy, heavy-headed, liverish, out-of-
sorts ; when your tongue is white, breath unpleasant
and complexion sallow—that is the time when Cockle’s
Pills prove invaluable. Two Cockle’s Pills to-night
will work wonders by
to-morrow —try them !

In the Old Coaching Days
in England long before railways existed Cockle’s
Pills constituted the sole family corrective in thou-
sands of homes. Merit alone has enabled them

MAKE UP YOUR
MIND TO HAVE
A PERFECT
BUST
There are to-day hundreds of women who were once thin, flat-
bosomed, hollow-cheeked and generally scraggly in appearance, and
suffering the effects of anamia and defective digestion, who are now for
the first time in their lives healthy, full-bosomed and pink-cheeked, and
enjoying the full vigor of robust womanhood, as the result of a few
weeks under our wonderful
“FLESH-FOOD” TREATMENT.
Many women whose figures have been spoiled by maternal duties
have been entirely restored to splendid form, and flat-chested young
women who suffered slow development have had the fault corrected bv
this treatment with lasting effect.
Flesh-Food is totally harmless in every respect. Its efficacy is
beyond question, and its use no demand upon the subject's time. Many
cases gained up to six pounds a week, and an increase in bust measure-
* ~T,, , ment up to 8 and 10 inches. Guarantee given in every case.
AM WOMAN who lacks good bust development lacks the one essential that creates a perfect
appearance. Lack of proper bust development, hollow cheeks and “salt-cellars” quickly take from
a woman the bloom and freshness 'of healthy womanhood. Misfortune may have been your lot in
so far as natural development is concerned,-but science has found a way to-correct your deficiency.
Fven though you have never been full-bosomed, and though you have been attenuated all your life,
if you suffer from no wasting disease, your bosom can be fully developed and your weight increased
to noimal. /r HAS BEEN DONE FOR THOUSANDS— WHY NOT YOU?
lou can readily see the effect of an increase in your weight or measurements. It is not neces-
sary to imagine you are being benefited. See what Miss M. LOURKE, of Tamworth, says
“Yours Go hand, and am pleased to state that your treatment increased my
weight considerably over two stone, and my bust measurements by several
inches. -Since using it I am much better in health, and my liesh is now firm
and I feel stronger and more vigorous. I thank you for the trouble you have
taken, and am grateful for all you have done for me.”
We publish an interesting book on the subject of attenuation and develop-
ment, and will send same and a FREE SAMPLE TREATMENT to you FREE
OF CHARGE upon receipt of a 2d. stamp'to pay part postage. All communica-
tions private and confidential. Write or call to-day for full particulars. [lBlB

Tobacco
Kills!

MOST MEN would
cure themselves of
the Tobacco Habit if
they knew they could
do so easily and also
without causing:
themselves discom-
fort. ... It takes but
ten minutes for To-
bacco to change the
beats of the heart.
To keep it up is to
tempt death by heart
disease, nervous col-
lapse, tobacco cancer
and stomach, liver or
kidney disease.
TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a harm-
less, vegetable remedy that will make the
user of tobacco in any form absolutely aban-
don the habit for good. It not destroys the
craving, the desire, the appetite for tobacco,
but restores to health the entire nervous sys-
tem, and aids Nature in entirely eliminating
from the system the Nicotine Poison of
Tobacco.

The Year Fifteen.
In Nineteen Fifteen times are old
And times are deadly slow;
I feel as if 1 had been born
A thousand years ago.
And all the things are nothing now,
Those million years have seen,
And all the men shall be as nought—
In a billion and fifteen.
You build and build as children build,
Admittedly in vain,
A tower of cards, or dominoes,
t To topple down again.
No matter what the first may he,
In numbers or in rank,
The last card is a rotten card,
Last domino a blank.
You build your Empires one by one,
And deem the world your own ;
And nothing lasts but papyrus,
And nothing lasts but stone.
And they last only till the new
Has swept away the old.
And Mankind’s history is told,
To be again retold.
But. let the Empires live or rot,
The kingdoms rise and fall,
We have a world of work to do,
Who never lived at all.
Who never had a history,
Must make and keep 11s clean,
If they would live Australian !
Yes. I’m your year Fifteen.

A Prayer for Widows.
Oh ! it’s great to be in a garden when the
Spring showers fall in the sun,
Digging a place for a peony, while a lily dies
like a nun;
Planting the pine and the poppy tree and kill-
ing invading slugs,
While the placid cow stands for the calf's
polished nose to butt at her swollen
dugs ;
Toiling and trenching and breaking, and
forget that the world was cold,
When the Polar bear was enjoying himself,
and the frozen day was old ;
When the only sane thing is the grizzly
bear, who sleepeth throughout the snow ;
And the Thredbo River has chattering teeth,
and ice is on Buffalo.
Many the polar explorers who crushed half
a ton of fame
From a hummock of snow, and a dune of
ice, a'nd the lurid Aurora flame;
But my pity was all for the widows, who
passed by my solemn pines—
Passed up the street and vanished by the
curtain of cirrous vines.
Widows all plump and youthful—roses in
wintry weeds—-
And their bloom gave the lie to the bomba-
zine, and the crape of their sombre
beads ;
For there was fire in the black of the ash,
and the cooling of the sinter;
And I prayed aloud: “God save the poor
little widows in winter!”
The icy winds from Bass’s Straits bow down
the ti-tree tall;
The southerly depressions through the yellow
wattle squall ;
The gale from far Kerguelen blows icicles
and snow,
And there’s rheumy eyes, and noses red at
Bright and Buffalo :
And the little widows shiver with their hand-
kerchiefs in hand—
But not for grief of him who’s settled down
within the land ;
For the snow is chillingly generous, and the
iceberg will not stint her—
And I fervently pray aloud. “God keep the
poor little widows in winter!’’
Their eyes are bright and their faces bloom,
and life forgets the dead,
Though the crape-black weepers float aloft
behind each shapely head;
And winter goes down to the coffin, but
Spring’s in the heel of the gale,
And they’re weary of wailing, because the
winter does naught but wail;
And the weeds are as foreign to them as
modesty is to a mummer —-
And I pray aloud, “God help the poor little
widows to last till summer!”

Reaction.
When I am' happy—when the tide of
laughter
Seems at the flood, then sad at heart am I;
For, at the ebb grey Sorrow will creep after
And some day I must die.
When I am gayest, then do I remember
Laughter that died and friends no jest'
can stir;
Life greys as quick as any scattered ember
And Death’s a slinking cur.
I count the years to Debit and to Credit
And groan to see how few are left to me;
The half-told yarn I inwardly sub-edit
And shock my company.
But when I’m sad —when debts and sorrows
thicken
And Death looms up, I burst in inward
song,
For Life is full of minor cares that sicken
And Life can be too long.
So funerals have moved me to mad laughter,
While wedding-feasts my heart with
sorrow bow ;
’Cause Custom leads and I’ll not follow
after.
I’m asked to neither now.

A NEW WAY TO OWE ODD DEBTS.
Dear Bulletin, —All manner of strange
things are liable to happen in the hard-
borrowing land of Australia, where most
people seem to have gone wild through
casualness and a profound faith in Provi-
dence. The prohibition by the N. S. Wales
Government of the export of wheat, lest it
might bring a little money into the State to
pay for the stupendous imports and to cover
the stupendous interest on foreign debts, is
one item. With a single eye to immediate
comfort, and no eye at all to the mortgage
on the country, it is held that grain
shouldn’t be sent away to help cover
our responsibilities, the gospel being
that we can always borrow from some-
body for “permanent and reproductive
works,” and can always cadge from some-
body to pay the interest on the borrowings,
and that things will adjust themselves at
the Twilight of the Gods, or on some other
occasion. The fact that the Australian people
may be glad to work 14 hours a day and to
eat very humble food when the bottom falls
out of their loan boom seems to strike a very
small section of the community.
* * * *
If Australia is judged by its dependence
on foreign loans it is the poorest, meanest
place on earth. But it isn’t poor, nor is it
mean. It has merely fallen into the hands
of thriftless and swollen-headed politicians,
who have no idea of political honor or
decency or responsibility, and who have no
inspiration beyond buying votes with bor-
rowed funds, and leaving the bill to those
who come after them. The whole policy of
its Governments is to import, in foreign ships,
manned by foreign cheap sailors, an incred-
ible quantity of foreign clothes and hard-
ware and drapery and tinned fish, and plug
hats and socks, made by the cheapest labor
that can be found. Thus it carefully re-
stricts local manufactures, and thereby it re-
stricts local population, and the number of
local defenders, and local taxpayers, and
bearers of the local public debt. It can’t
have a large population of local workers
when it doesn’t work, but acquires extrane-
ous picture hats and Saratoga trunks for
preference. Then, as it can’t export enough,
with its small population and its huge de-
sire for luxury and good times and short
hours and football and holidays, to pay for
its imports, it borrows something like
£20,000,000 a year in England in order to
prevent the country being stripped of its
last copper. And out of the loans that are
left to posterity it is able for the moment to
demonstrate that this is a great continent
for the worker. Also it declares that it will
support the Empire to the bitter end, which
is the least it can do, seeing that the Empire
is lighting for its life in a quarrel that has
been forced upon it, and that Australia, as
part of the Empire, is also fighting for its
life.
* * * *
Yet because Australia has preferred
to buy United States and German shirts
and ox-tongues rather than raise a solid
manufacturing population of its own, and
has chosen to depend on the foreigner rather
than to learn self-reliance, it isn’t doing
much for the Empire. In times past it has
gone into debt to the extent of over
£300,000,000 in order to meet the draft for
the foreign goods—the pokers and petticoats
and dredges and ships and silks and bell-
toppers—which prevented it having people
and workshops of its own. It is begging at
Bull’s door for more loans to pay for the
scrap of assistance it has offered to Bull ;
also to keep its public works and brief hours
and big remuneration boom afloat. The busi-
ness goes round in a series of vicious circles.
The gold discoveries made high wages. The
Freetrade or Low Tariff disease made the
high-wage Australian unable to compete
with the lower-wage European. The im-
ports began to pour in and blight the pro-
spects of local employment. The big loans
were started to pay for the imports and
to provide local employment. The gold
boom having died while the high-wage tra-
dition remained, the bigger loans started to
keep the prosperity rushing along. The
idea arose that, because Australia is a “new
country,” it can pay twice more remunera-
tion for fewer hours than any European
State. Along with that came the idea that,
because it is a “new country,” it can’t be
expected to pay its way like any European
State, but must borrow at all times and
seasons. The result is inefficiency, casual-
ness, procrastination, optimism, general con-
fusion and enlarged feet. We are the salt of
the earth when we discourse on the “bound-
less natural resources” which serve as
security for Cohen. We are the dog of the
earth when we explain that, alone among
the nations, we can’t get along even in time
of peace without foreign support. The salt
and the dog have a tendency to become
mixed.
* * * *
This _ situation calls for thought. The
Australian Government and most of the
States expect big deficits this year. The
British Government, hard-pressed as it is,
and up against a huge burden of new taxes
and an anticipated war deficit of more
than £200,000,000, has found this coun-
try an advance of £18,000,000; but
there is no certainty that any more
advances will be available till the war
is finished. Anyhow it is a poor sort
of business _to lean up against Bull for
accommodation when his hands and his horns
and his tail are up to their eyes in the
biggest war of all history. A country of so
many natural resources as Australia pos-
sesses should hardly do that sort of thing.
The exports of wool, which help in ordinary
times to pay interest on our foreign liabili-
ties, are greatly hampered by the European
mix-up. The air (as already mentioned) is
full of schemes for reducing or preventing
the export of wheat and meat in order that
the people may have cheap food, though it
is hard to see how Australia is to preserve
even a semblance of solvency unless it ex-
ports something, regardless of Ideal food
prices. The N.S.W. Government, being the
boss profligate of the Commonwealth, has
been trying to sell the job of the construc-
tion of State railways to an English firm
of Private Enterprise, and has fallen down
even on that proposition. The trouble is
that this country has been struggling in the
money-lender’s office for 44 years to pay
interest on the celluloid collar which it im-
ported from Philadelphia in 1870. Now that
the lOU industry has struck a reef it is time
to cast aspersion upon the celluloid collar
which was imported from Philadelphia.
Australia requires more inhabitants. It
requires money to pay its interest bill. It
requires money to keep its public works
going. If it hasn’t got the money, partly
because of the failure of Coiienstein in-
Frankfort, partly because of the collapse
of wool exports, and partly because its im-
ports have always been ahead of its means—
the only visible remedy is to reduce the im-
ports and the consequent outflow of cash.
This is where a strenuous Protective tariff
would come in—-unless the Freetraders have
something better to offer. For the 11 months
to the end of November, 1914, Australia,
bought nearly £69,000,000 worth of im-
ported goods, and exported £60,000,000 worth
of goods to pay for them. The discrepancy
of £9,000,000 had to be covered by loans,
and it represented £9,000,000 worth
of work and wages which we didn’t
have. The whole 11 months’ interest
on foreign liabilities, public and pri-
vate, had to be covered by loans, and that re-
presented £14,000,000 worth of work which
we didn’t have. When the loans stop the
imports must leave off to a great extent. Then
local industry would boom, save for one draw-
back. No man will put up big factories in
Australia while he knows that he is merely
a stopgap—that as soon as the war is over
and the lOU is again sailing on the high seas
he will be up against the old problem of
paying wages 100 per cent, higher than those
of Europe with about 25 per cent. Protection,
to meet the discrepancy. So the country
will go bare-headed and bare-footed and in-
competent, pending the time when it can
raise more help in England to purchase
articles of German manufacture. The whole
business is a weariness and a labyrinth.—
Yours confusedly and with much repetition,
Henry Horsecollar.
SAUSAGE AND SECESSION.
Last week sausage rose to sd. per lb. in Syd-
ney, and, incidentally, a secession meeting
was held at Grafton. There have been many
secession movements both on the Northern
Rivers and in Iliverina, and presumably one
of them will succeed at last, as the Queens-
land and Port Phillip movements did in other
times, on the principle that the jug which
goes to the pub too often comes back full of
beer at last. At the same time, and quite
apart from the secession meeting at Grafton,
it cannot be said that the war prices of meat
in Sydney are higher than might be expected.
The more vulgar variety of beefsteak
is quoted at 6d. to 7d. per lb., and
the humble leg of mutton at sd. There is
certainly a general increase, but it isn’t more
per cent, than the increase for which the
boiler-makers are striking, and it isn’t a
patch on the increase in the public debt, nor
does it bear even a faint resemblance to the
increase in the amount of meat that ought to
be exported to pay interest on the debt. A
general impression prevails that, until the
other day, beef was sold in N.S.W. at the
price of an old song. This is partly but not
wholly correct, seeing that the figure for
plain, fresh cow-meat was 6d. per lb. in the
exceptional year 1825. And then the squatter
raised his herds just outside Balmain, and
the bullock could leave home at 4 a.m. and
walk cheaply to his doom, and be on the
table in time for lunch.
* * * «
The increase in prices—which is an ex-
ceedingly variable increase—may be ascribed
to many causes. The gold boom caused a
temporary rise and the first borrowing boom
caused another. The cow went up and down.
But all the time the cattle-man was pushed
further out, and his animals had to travel
further to get to market. The congestion
policy caused many country towns to decay
in order to bloat Sydney : so Sydney, which is
about the furthest town from the cattle-man’s
haunts, became more and more the one reli-
able purchaser on a large scale. As the
squatter was shifted from Balmain to Nyn-
gan and Bourke he struck a land of inferior
rainfall, and his business became more pre-
carious. He played two-up with Providence.
His taxes increased owing to the public debt,
and his wages bill increased. The days when
the station laborer got £22 10s. a year, and
might be paid in half-joes (worth 40s. each),
or Spanish ducats, or gold mohurs and
rupees from India, or Mexican silver, or in a
nameless copper coinage said to be worth
2d. a piece—these days are gone, and it is
to be hoped they will never return. Then
freezing and chilling processes were invented,
and a foreign market was found, and a new
demand was created, and prices went up.
Everybody was so glad that one of the
staple assets of the country had increased in
value, that many aldermen became greasy and
intoxicated at banquets, and all manner of
things were said about how the State was
improving. Before this resurrection hap-
pened meat, after being as high as 6d. per
lb., had in two separate years sagged down
to lfd., and the squatter had for the moment
a strong inclination to murder the heifer in
cold blood and go in for bushranging. With
the new rise in prices—which, of course,
applied all round—came a very definite im-
provement in the station workers’ conditions.
Incidentally, the once wretchedly-paid butch-
er’s assistant and other employees of the
trade got a little better remuneration. Inci-
dentally, also, the rent of the butcher’s shop
went up (partly through congestion and
partly through the increased cost of build-
ing), and his taxes, and many other
things. Probably the butcher’s greed in-
creased also —likewise the squatter’s avarice.

There are many diverse elements leading
up to the fact that sausage is now sd. The
stock of cattle in N.S.W. has been decreas-
ing for a number of years. The decrease
started when seasons were fairly good, when
prices were quite respectable, and when the
demand for export had temporarily dimin-
ished. The population of about two-thirds
of the State —the part which contains most
of the bullock lands —is also decreasing.
Strawberry, the dairy cow, is growing less
numerous. The sheep is much less frequent
than he was in 1909. The pig has partly
left off. All this leads back to the theory
that the decline arises from the same cause
which prevents the Northern Territory accu-
mulating good white inhabitants —the lack
of cheap and handy access to a market. As
the beef-grower is moved further west to
make room for wheat, and the mass of cus-
tomers moves more and more into the County
of Cumberland in the south-east, the cost of
shifting the animal to the customer in-
creases, and the losses incurred on the road
increase also. Yet there is no need for these
absurd distances. Most of the fertile sections
of the Ma State are within 200 or 250 miles
of a good port, alongside which there should
be a good city. Even the extreme south-
west corner, which looks like the most re-
mote and uninhabitable fragment of all, and
which is empty enough to justify the idea —
even this homeless dog of a place is within
convenient reach of three good ports, and
but for the policy which connects everything
with Sydney, and tries to push all the meat-
eaters and meat-exporters into Sydney, it
should have cattle and sheep in multitudes.
* * * *
With a reasonable distribution of popula-
tion, and a fair division of the export trade
among all the deep-water ports, there would
almost certainly be a vast increase in the
number of animals, and a reduction in price,
and more profits for everybody concerned.
The cow isn’t a first-class pedestrian, nor
does she thrive on immense journeys in slow
hot trains on congested railways. The
struggle to put the greatest -possible distance
between her and the consumer is bad for
all parties. The animal that arrives is
tough and lean and mad, and despite all its
deficiencies it has to pay for the one that
doesn’t arrive, but is buried on the
road. Possibly the people at Grafton,
who started their feeble secession move-
ment, only struck a great truth by accident.
The opening up of new centres of population
would tend to shift some of the pressure
from the old centre. It would bring more
people nearer to more bullocks, and every
hundred miles that is cut off the distance
between the live beef and its market is 100
more reasons for growing beef. Meanwhile,
as already mentioned, sausage—and very
suspicious sausage in many cases —costs sd.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Good Time for the Peace Society.
A sort of sensation that something was
missing has of late pervaded the Australian
•community. It felt like a man who had
either lost his leg or 2d., and hadn’t quite
located his position. There was a premoni-
tion that somebody had been buried, and that
he might be Jones or otherwise; also that
a trusted friend had failed, and that what
we reasonably looked for had burst and
gone back on us. Now we have got over
the first terror of the War, and we can locate
the absent establishment. It is the Peace
and Anti-Defence and anti-Army and anti-
Navy and anti-“ Conscription” body, which
was run by the estimable Miss Rose Scott
and other religious lights—now mostly blown
out. The affair failed just when it was
most needed. It was quite prepared to
supply peace while there was peace, and
when its job was an easy matter of carrying
coals to Newcastle or ice-cream to Green-
land. But when there is bitter strife,
and calm is really needed, it can’t even
suggest how to furnish the article. The
apostles of the movement told us very
recently that the days of war were over.
Norman Angell and others proved this by
intricate figures, and learned deductions, and
diagrams, and brilliant inferences. They
showed — Norman Angell especially—that
commerce and finance and international
relations are now so tied up together that
if any raging fool in a spiked helmet tried
to make trouble his schemes would break
down almost in a day. Somehow the fool
in the helmet hasn’t yet broken down. The
Australian peace-at-any-price folk travelled
on the pleasant assumption that Australia
was the only unreasonable bully on earth,
and that no nation would do us wrong pro-
vided we were humble and honest and
attacked nobody. The theory had points of
interest, yet the fact remains that Tas-
mania, which never _ sent an ultimatum to
Berlin in all its quiet, unobtrusive, apple-
growing existence, is at war with the whole
German Empire. A maddened Quaker of
the anti-Defence crowd sent a letter to the
Australian press not long ago, in which he
illustrated the gospel of non-resistance with
a story about a non-resistant Quaker boy,
who was threatened with stoush by a large,
dirty, truculent boy, whose finger-nails were
probably a disgrace; but disarmed him with
a smile. _ The beauty of the parable couldn’t
be questioned. Still in the present annoy-
ance no country smiled harder than Servia.
It smiled till its face was nearly worn out.
It had no desire to get into a strangle-hold
with an enemy 10 times its size. But when
it learned that, because an Austrian subject
had murdered an Austrian prince in Aus-
trian • territory, it was required to admit
Austrian soldiers and police to Servia, and
allow Austrian judges to sit in its courts,,
it saw that the object of the big enemy was
plain annexation. So it gave up smiling and
saved the rest of its face for defence pur-
poses. Belgium also smiled hard in an
attempt to pacify an alleged friend 10 times
its size. But it learned that it was expected
to hand over its country to be used as a
military base in a war between two other
countries, and to leave its fortresses and
its people and its resources at the mercy
of the Kaiser, so it also shut its countenance
hard and reached for its gun. The
Bulletin has no reason to regard the Aus-
tralian Peace and anti-Defence folk as other
than estimable characters, but it seems a
pity that they should practically suspend
their organisation just when if is most
wanted. If they could show now that Servia
fell into the soup because of its habit of
sending ultimatums to Vienna, and that
Belgium was only attacked because it was
obviously preparing to take Berlin, and that
it was Tasmania’s fiendish attacks on
Turkey that brought it into conflict with that
fezzed empire, then we would understand
how to be more placid and non-resistant
next time.
Putting It on the Youth.
For about a fortnight the daily papers fan
an agitation on the urgent need of more
recruits. Its immediate effect was to bring
out of hiding every anti-Australian and pur-
veyor of Decayed Fish in the Common-
wealth. “A Woman” wrote in the Mel-
bourne Argus
Returning to Australia the spirit, or rather lack
of spirit, here is lamentable. The drought is re-
garded as more serious than the War. It is not
tactful, I find, to ask: “Has your son or brother
gone to the War?” They haven’t Our men are
holding back, letting the brave Tommies face fearful
odds, though there are plenty of men in Australia—
-1,500,000 of a fit age for service.
Another sample, also anonymous, is from
the S. M. Herald (5/1/T5) :
On Saturday, as I left my work at two in the
afternoon, I saw hundreds of young, athletic men
trooping across the Domain to see two men beat
Australians at swimming. It is recorded that 6000
persons were present in the Domain baths on Satur-
day, paying their money to see this swimming
match. Those 6000 are not giving themselves, we
know, to the War. Are the murdered old men, the
women and children, and those maimed, outraged,
and defiled at the hands of the barbarian nothing
to you, Australians? What appeal can be made to
you ? If you cannot find the sense of duty, or if
you lack the valor of the men of other parts of the
Empire, who are doing their part, at least stop
“killing with your mouth.” How many of the Aus-
tralian contingent are British born, Mr. Minister
for Defence? Let us have the figures, and then we
shall see what is really being done by Australia in
the little she has done so far.
The press has published columns of this
embittered remittance-man stuff, but it did
not print a line officially mentioning that
nine-tenths of it was slanderously unjust,
till a day or so ago when Senator Millen
provided the public with the cold facts of
the case. (Millen was the Defence Min-
ister who, shortly after the war broke out,
offered Kitchener, “the last drop of blood
and the last ear of wheat” in the Common-
wealth, and got back the cold, business-like
reply that 30,000 trained and equipped soldiers
were all that were required.) Millen made
three points. The first was in regard to
the men available. There is, says he, “not
the slightest difficulty in obtaining all that
can be equipped.” Aiso: “Colonel Wallace:
lias stated that the enrolment is over 1000
a month ahead of the declared requirements,
and, if necessary, he can double this rate.”
Which bears out the testimony of hundreds
of Australians who have tried to join the
colors and have been turned back. Millen
passed on to the questions of (1) training,
and (2) equipment. As regards training,
“he does not pretend that there is not a
difficulty here,” and, in the matter of equip-
ment, “though the factories and resources
of Australia are quite equal, ultimately, to
meet the demand, yet they are not in a
position to do it now”: —
There is a shortage of clothing, boots, accoutre-
ments, mess kits, tentage, transport vehicles, etc.


As to rifles, admittedly the supply in Australia is
not unlimited, and obviously every rifle cannot be
regarded as available for service abroad. The opinion
I have expressed as to the available supply of rifles,
applies equally to ammunition.
In the sum, then, the poorness of Australia’s
response—if it is to be regarded as poor-
lias nothing to do with the national spirit,
and nothing to do with lack of courage or
patriotism on the part of the youth of the
Commonwealth, but is a plain matter of
insufficient training facilities, and a short-
age of clothes, arms and ammunition. In
other words, it is not the young men of Aus-
tralia who deserve to be crucified, but those
short-sighted politicians who are mostly old
men. For years and years patriotic Aus-
tralians have been talking Defence to these
garrulous impostors, and insisting on the
necessity of building up great national in-
dustries by means of an effective tariff. Dur-
ing all that time the answer has been that
Protection was an economic fallacy, and
that the better way was to import goods
from places like Germany and Austria. And
as regards Defence the time was alleged to
be unripe, and universal service an un-
English device which struck at the roots of
Freedom. Most people in Britain are
frankly regretting now that the United
Kingdom did not follow Lord Roberts’s
counsel years ago, and adopt compulsory
training. Many sound authorities have
that if this had been done there would have
been no war. It is a saner and more gener-
ous attitude than that of the calamity-
howlers ot Australia. Because these frauds
were successful in delaying universal service
for some years, there is a shortage of officers
for training and other purposes: and be-
cause their campaign against genuine Pro-
tection has been more or less successful,
Australian factories are up against a bigger
proposition than they can handle at once.
Whereupon those who are really the guilty
parties fly off at a tangent and accuse the
youth of Australia of cowardice. The habit
of putting it all on the youth is being over-
done.
A Call to Arms.
“Me” writes (he is a man who has seen
war, but his white locks disqualify him
now) :
What I want to know—l ask merely for informa-
tion—is how the Allies are going to defeat the Ger-
mans? There is a confident belief that we are going
to smash the Kaiser, but the process does not seem
yet to have begun. So far, Germany has not been
invaded to any great extent. So far, she is living
mostly on occupied territory. So far, she has her
fleet in being. For the past couple of months Ger-
many is said to have been on the defensive; but it
is a pretty healthy defensive. She has swept over
Poland almost to Warsaw, and been swept back, three
times; and the last time she did not sweep back as
far as she did the other times. On the western front
she is being slowly driven towards Berlin, but no
map is large enough to show the change. Something
on the scale of a yard to an inch is required. The
censor reports his daily progress, half of which is
made up of villages re-taken or trenches re-captured.
It is obvious that before the Allies can re-take or
re-capture anything they must have first lost it.
And we hear of these losses only when we have re-
trieved them. The victories usually consist of half
a haystack or a quarter of a backyard or several
yards of barbed-wire entanglements.
I’m not complaining, but it seems, at this rate of
progress, a long, long way to Potsdam. We are told
that the western front is being held by inferior
German troops. And against these we have put the
finest and freshest British troops. Again, I’m not
complaining. For it seems to me that this war has
proved that if an army has time properly to entrench
it cannot be driven out of its rabbit-holes at any
great rate, no matter whether the rabbits be Boy
Scouts or Prussian Guards, except by fearful losses of
the attackers. And already the whisper has come
that the western Allies do not consider the inches so
gained worth the appalling losses. I don’t complain
of that sensible decision, but again I ask, how are we
going to defeat the Germans?
Everybody has got a plan. “Oh, in the spring
we’ll have a new army of a million men at the front.”
Well, so perhaps will Germany. “But we’ll land that
million in Schleswig and attack the Kiel Canal, and
so dig out the German fleet.” But Germany will have
its extra million ready for that effort; or, if not, its
extra million will be in Flanders, and on the way
to Calais and Paris. It looks to me like stale-mate.
We can’t get the German fleet. We can’t drive the
German army back more than a few yards a day;
and every yard we go the resistance will be aided
more and more by defences. When we reach German
territory—say, in 1921- —we will find the advantages
of position and of defensive facilities overwhelmingly
in Germany’s favor. Again, I ask, merely for infor-
mation, how are we going to defeat the German
army ?
“Ah, but you are forgetting Russia?” I am not
forgetting Russia. I am asking how are we going to
defeat Germany. Somehow it seems up to us. “But
we’ll starve Germany out, or there’ll be a revolution,
or something.” Maybe; but again I ask merely for
information —how we are going to defeat the German
army? Of course, the same reasoning is doubtless
worrying the German General Staff. How are they
going to defeat the armies of the Allies? They had
their only chance in the first few weeks of the war,
and failed. In modern warfare it is increasingly evi-
dent that modern armies cannot be defeated if in-
spired by a common patriotism and decently led.
So it looks like a tremendous stale-mate. You may
say that would be defeat enough for the Germans.
Yes, but how many years will it take before Germany
sees it?
It resolves itself, apparently, into a question of
numbers. If Britain and the Dominions could put five
millions into the field, and were prepared to sacrifice
a million of them in casualties, there would be some
hope of victory within a year. But are we doing our
darnedest?
Meantime, I again ask —merely for information —
if anybody has got any other scheme about him by
which we could defeat the German army?

The Cornstalk Wheat Muddle.
The N.S.W. Government’s wheat-purchase
racket grows more and more like the effort
of a bumble-bee to make a great buzz on
the window-pane by way of misdirected
advertisement. In the first place, it was a
probably illegal interference with the
Federal law that trade must be free among
the States. It also looked like a spasm of
parochial hostility against the States which
are short of grain, the idea being to prohibit
the sale to them of N.S.W.’s surplus. It
looked, furthermore, like a special attempt
to drag all N.S.W. commerce to Sydney, by
prohibiting grain trade over the land borders,
and this didn’t square with the alleged
decentralisation policy. It smelled of
muddle, because, though the man who had
undertaken to sell wheat to a miller at a
low price was relieved of his bargain, the
miller who had undertaken to supply flour
at a low price wasn’t relieved of his bargain.
It smelled of more muddle because the
farmer who had undertaken to sell wheat
to a miller at a high price had the selling
value of his goods cut down, while the miller
could still charge any figure for flour that
was procurable. It smelled of most muddle
when it was found that three immensely
rich firms had been appointed middleman
to acquire wheat for the Government at a
very lavish commission, so that many small
but honest dealers found their businesses
confiscated. A temporary annoyance arose
when it transpired that the inferior grain
used for feeding the domestic chooky-hen
was charged at the same price as the grain
employed by human beings. The chooky-
hen said it couldn’t lay the regulation egg
at the price, and the human being said in
anger that he wasn’t any dashed old hen.
Some complication transpired because,
though the N.S.W. Government bought
wheat at ss. per bushel and sold it to millers
at ss. 6d., the farmer was allowed to appeal
to the Necessary Commodities Board to allot
him a higher price if that seemed a fair
thing. ' People remarked that if the farmer
was allowed 6s. 6d. for breadstuff which the
Cabinet had already sold at ss. 6d. the
Cabinet would fall in. Still, the farmer
learned that he would, in every instance, have
to fight his own case before the Board, and,
as he would seldom be able to put up the
legal expenses, the Cabinet wasn’t So likely
to fall in as might be expected. If anybody
made a profit out of the business the lawyer
was the most probable man. Again, the
wretched bucolic person ascertained that,
in order to get more than ss. per bushel for
his wheat, he must rush —with costly legal
aid —to the Board within 14 days from “the
date of the proclamation.” But the bucolic
folk can’t appeal against the price at which
their wheat is taken until their wheat is
taken, and in some places the agents of the
three very rich Private Enterprise firms,
which have got the buying monopoly at a
very liberal commission on the Government’s
behalf, haven’t appeared yet. Having got
the monopoly they have no need to hurry.
Meanwhile the brief spell during which an
appeal is possible is running out, as. all
things do by reason of the effluxion of time.
The water that passes under the old stone
bridge doesn’t come back, nor does the
time which rolls under the calendar. The
infuriated farmer declares that when he
takes his wheat to the local railway
station, where he used to sell it promptly,
on good terms or bad terms, to the local
dealer, he is often told that he must pay
storage on it till the agent of the
Government’s hired monopolist comes along.
Having no clear idea when that will be he
sometimes demurs. If he demurs too much
he can either take the wheat home again,
or stack it by the roadside, where it is
liable to be eaten by Norman Lindsay’s
native bear, while the owner is sued for
trespass. If he owes some advances to some
humble agent whose business has been
disqualified by the Holman Government,
the humble agent asks him to pay up. If
lie has sold to somebody across the
Victorian border the person over the border
threatens to sue him for damages for non-
delivery, and explains that the Holman
Government’s say-so doesn’t necessarily hold
good in the Federal courts. When he
applies to the bank he generally finds that
the bank isn’t wildly affluent just now.
There is also something in the way of a
drought. One way and another the feeling
prevails that a, mess has been made of things.
The feeling wouldn’t be so bad if it wasn’t
strongly suspected that the present crowd is
in office solely because someone, faked the
second ballots in a heroic fashion at last
election. Everybody hates to be trodden on
by a crowd which holds office on a doubtful
title. Meanwhile the price of the loaf has
risen, which is the biggest joke of all.
The of Broken Hill.
Broken Hill is a place where strange
things happen. It is a sort of an outlaw town.
All its trade is with Adelaide, because its
railway connects with Adelaide. It lies with-
in a few miles of the South Australian bor-
der. But the Government at Adelaide, has no
control over it, because it is located in New
South Wales. And New South Wales has
very little control, because the railways from
Sydney to Cobar and Hay, which are the
most adjacent pretence of communication,
stop some hundreds of miles short of
the Barrier. The Sydney Government
will put up with a lot from Broken
Hill rather than try to maintain order. The
business costs too much. Consequently, ex-
cept when the Government at Sydney
becomes wild, and starts to dash things
about and go over the speed limit, the miner
at Broken Hill —who is. largely a Cousin
Jack, otherwise an Ancient Briton from
Cornwall —is very much of a law unto him-
self. He is a good-humored and casual kind
of a law, still there are times when his meth-
ods make the community tired. He is too
much like Bret Harte’s Outcasts of Poker
Flat. As a case in point, it was
decided last Sunday (there is no real Sun-
day on the Barrier) at a Trades Hall
meeting, that, the mining industry being
slack, the single men should go out in a
body on Monday, and .“ demand im-
mediately handsome contributions” from
the local commercial firms. What would
happen to the local firms if they didn’t put
up the money wasn’t mentioned, but in a
wooden town there are many chances. All
would probably depend on the size of the
gap between Broken Hill and Cobar, where
the railway from Sydney ends. The propo-
sition could hardly be called buslirang.ing,
for bush is scarce in those parts, but it might
possibly be defined as slag-ranging, or rob-
bery-under-tailings. Also it might be
called violent beggary. New South Wales
would save itself a lot of small troubles if
it handed over Broken Hill and the Ancient
Britons thereof to South Australia, so that
the one Government which has railway
connection with the Ancient Briton would
be responsible for his welfare. The grand
old silver city is a difficult place to manage
from afar off. It stops paying rent at the
first sign of unrest. It has. strange spasms
and strange breakages. It is always flying
off the handle. When a few of its people
went away to fight for Australia against
the Germans a crowd gathered at the rail-
way station and called them murderers. And
when two Turks ran amok a crowd wrecked
the local German Club by way of getting
square with the two dead Turks. Hysteria
and mob law appear to be the characteristics
of this lonesome settlement, which has run
wild in the desert.

Between the two factions struggling for
power in Maoriland there is precious little
difference. In Ward’s favor it can be said
that he will usually find a bone for the bottom
dog; but he is a political profligate, whose
borrowings have a bad habit of corrupting
the constituencies. The best that can be
said of Massey is that he is not constitu-
tionally predisposed to corruption, and for
that reason, perhaps, has labored industri-
ously to secure the genuine reform of the
public service. Under Seddon and Ward
the service was given over to log-rolling and
wire-pulling. Mainly through the insistence
cf Attorney-General Heroman, Massey
laid a willing axe at the root of this scandal.
As for M.L. Labor, in point of organisation
it is in very much the same situation as a
submarine after the periscope has been shot
away. It is merely rushing about pursuing
the enemy blindfolded. From it the coun-
try gets no help in regard to the thing of
which it is in most urgent need —a realisa-
tion of the dreadfulness of the national bor-
rowing operations. Nor are Maoriland’s pro-
speets improved in this connection by the
likelihood of the return of lou Ward.
Mass'.y may borrow as hard as WARD when
he gets the chanc^; but Ward has a simply-
fiendish ingenuity in inventing chances.
«
The fool or the makeweight or the man who
couldn’t be trusted with any other job has
always been given the portfolio of Post-
master-General in Australia. When there
was a Dan O’Connor that had to be pro-
vided for he was sent to the Post Office to
“appint Maloney” or do any other old thing.
Naturally the postal services became,
on the whole, the most incompetent in Aus-
tralia ; not so much because the material
was bad as because wire-pullers were given
promotion. In course of time, as a result
of bad officering, a vast mass of mad rules
and vicious precedents have been established,
and to-day there isn’t a department with
such another tangle of red tape in the wrong
place. At every turn you strike some
idiocy, and the most deplorable part of the
business is that it is usually an expensive
idiocy. In the present Commonwealth
Administration the old practice has been
followed. W. G. Spence, an untried Min-
ister, just on 70 years of age, was made
P.M.G.; and it is not much reflection on a
fine old Labor organiser to say that, as far
as he has gone, the job has proved far beyond
him. Isn’t there a young man the Ministry
can turn on to the special job of making a
list of the expensive idiocies? The P.-M.-G.
ought to be the best man in the Ministry.
He has a job far more important than that
of any State Railway Commissioner because
he has to carry the mails of six States, and
to carry them where railways were never
heard of, and also to hump them all over the
earth.

Last week the S. M. Herald published,
apparently as a sort of recruiting advertise-
ment, a splendidly heroic sketch about one
Sam Allen. Sam, according to the author
of him, left nothing to be desired and very
little to be hoped for. He could ride and
track and shoot, and make bullies measure
their length on the floor by simply shooting
out his fist at them. He was “straight as a
sapling and tall,” and had no more than
the necessary amount of stomach. There
was a fiery gleam in his eye, his cheque had
never been dishonored, and he was loved
by everybody who had ever met him or seen
his boots outside an hotel bedroom door.
There was no doubt abut Sam : he was the
complete, good citizen, and the fact that his
proud father was a squatter was thrown in as
a guarantee of his complete respectability.
Of course, when War broke out Sam volun-
teered, with the consent of his grand old
dad, and was given the pick of the station
horses so that he might be a credit to the
Light Horse. It was a beautiful story and
it might have fired a lot more Sams, but
for the fact that they weren’t on hand to fire,
most of the population of Australia being
penned up in a few cramped coastal cities
where they can neither be Sam Allens
themselves nor rear Sam Allens for the
future. As a willing congestionist, the
S. M. Herald has foolishly toiled to keep
down the supply of bush-bred Sams and
boost the production of importers’ clerks
who can shoot nothing but the breakers and
their cuffs and ride only barebacked trams.
In these circumstances, is the Herald really
sincere about its perfect Sam Allen, or is it
laughing in its umbrella?
The present War has put up many records.
The latest one concerns the battle between
the Russians and the 'Turks just south of
the Caucasus. For the first time in written
history, two big armies campaigned in the
depth of winter on a plateau 10,000 feet
above sea level. The soldiers slept in the
snow; dragged their artillery through the
snow; abandoned their guns when they dis-
appeared in the snow ; and fought in primi-
tive fashion waist deep in snow. The dead
and wounded froze hard and were abandoned
because no one could dig graves for them.
Somewhere about half a million men threw
icebergs at one another, and as the Russian
was the best shot with an iceberg the Turk
presently took the back track for home —
what was left of him. There was possibly
a similar war very long ago, but no records
were left of it. About 1000 years since the
Scandanavians made settlements in Green-
land, and built two of what they called
cities, and constructed a sort of cathedral
of driftwood and whalebone, and appointed
a bishop of all things, though what the place
most wanted was a gas-stove. And they
started civilisation. But, owing to troubles
in Europe, the colony was neglected for a
century or two. And when the mother
country had time to look it up again, every
European settler and every trace of Euro-
pean culture was gone, and the Skraelings,
or Eskimo, or limits, or LoRD-knows-who
were in possession. They spoke a sort of
whale-oil or seal-fat language, and refused
to state how.the white settlers had perished.
So the story of a great struggle among the
bergs and floes is lost.
It was an interesting circumstance that the
N.S.W. Railway Workers and General
Laborers’ Association recently decided to
support the proposed handing over of the
State’s railway construction to the English
Private Enterprise firm of Norton Grif-
fiths and Co. because :
Ample safeguards can be inserted in the scheme
to protect the interests of workmen. Unlike the con-
tract system, the scheme offers no inducement for the
sweating of employees.
The idea was that the works were to loa.f
along at any old shirk, and the English Pri-
vate Enterprise firm was to charge N.S.W.
their cost, however exorbitant it might be,
with a handsome commission added. Also,
the English Private Enterprise firm was. to
charge the price of the work to posterity,
with its commission on the loan added. And
if the old man, who was so anxious not to

half a day’s work for a whole day’s pay, the
kid would have to carry a debt of £2OOO for

about the old man’s terror lest he should, by
working too hard, miss a chance to swindle
the baby in the cause of liberty!
War Music.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
William the proud,
Boss of the Germans —-
All sorts of Germans —•
Prussians, Bavarians,
Uhlans and sausages,
Lagers and sauerkraut,
Saxons and zeppelins—
Blew on his war-horn.
Lo, they came marching,
Legion on legion,
Army on army,
Shouting his name.
And the band played, “Pom-diddte-om-pom-
pom!”
Loud was the challenge of guns and of
howitzers.
Nations grew pale e’er the boots were on top
of them.
Smashing the fences of other folks’ property,
Killing the greybeard, the babe at its
mother’s breast,
Dancing on treaties and pledges and decency,
Vaunting their strength and their culture
they came.
And the band played, “Diddle-dumpty. Diddle-
dumpty. Diddle-dumpty. Dum-dum /”
Great was the noise they woke.
Shouts made in Germany
Mingled with bursting bombs,
Rushing of motor-cars,
Whirring of aeroplanes,
Thunder from cannon throats.
Then they fell back from the Marne to the
Aisne.
And the band played, “Pom-pom-pee! Pom-
pom-pee! Pom-pom-tiddle-om! Tiddlo
om-pee!”
William the sore,
Digger of German graves,
Spake to his legions :
“Though they have smitten you,
Hammered you, driven you,
Have yet another try,
Blokes of the Fatherland.
Smash through to Dover Strait,
Capture me Calais town,
Get me a place to make
Faces at Kent.”
Rose they and laced their boots,
Rushed on the bayonets,
Tasted the points of them,
Then sprinted back.
And the band played, “Dum-dum. Dum-dum.
Diddle-dum. Dum!”
William, the not at all
Like a Napoleon,
Kept at his contract,
Steadily, earnestly,
Faithfully, lovingly,
Prayerfully, tearfully
Urging the best of his
People to die
And the band played solemnly without varia-
tion, “Dum. Dum. Dum. Dum. Dum.
Dum.”
Such is the state of affairs just at present,
Such is the music the prospect demandeth;
But with the spring, when the green leaves
are fluttering.
Hungry Berlin will rise fierce as a crocodile,
Germans will rush from their trenches and
back again,
Back again into their trenches and out of
them,
Out of them swiftly and over the Rhine.
And as the German band will then be out of
breath,
Another musical combination will take up
the trombones and play, “Dickety-diclcety-
dumpty. Dickety-dickety-doo . Dickety-
dickety-dumpty. D ud-dum-dum!
What shall the end be?
Germans, with trembling,
Look to the dawning,
Gaze on the sunset.
Europe’s wide rat-trap
Snaps on their rout.
Snaps on the zeppelins,
Snaps on the sausages,
Pinches the fingers
Of princes and chancellors,
Jams on the war-hardened tears of the boss
of them,
Fixes its steel fangs in William the Blot.
And the Allied bands enter Berlin playing,
“Rumpty-dooley. Rumpty-dooley. liumpty-
dooley-diddle-dumpty. Diddle-om-pom-
pom-pom-pom /”

The Great War Horror dp to Date.
The past week has been distinguished by a
strange lack of news about the Kaiser. The
present writer carefully paws over a pint of
newspaper cuttings, and all he can find out
is that, a while ago, the Great Prussian mur-
derer was ill. Then the Great Prussian mur-
derer sort of dropped out. He isn’t reported
as having fled at full speed from one battle-
front to another; as having taken personal
command of anything; as having watched
any bombardment; as having ordered any
place to be captured regardless of cost. It
may be that he is going to quietly wander off
the map of things, like the Emperor of Aus-
tria —who hasn’t been positively identified
now for many weeks —and the Sultan of Tur-
key, who is never mentioned at all these
times. Apparently the German General von
der Goltz runs Turkey, and the ancient
Shadow of God is either defunct or hidden
under the bed. Turkey seems to have gone
quite mad with muddle and poverty and de-
feat. . It made its great effort against the
Russians in the Armenian highlands, and was
wiped out, whereupon its picturesque and
much-advertised hero, Enver Pasha, re-
signed his command and left for the fleshpots
of Constantinople. It is pathetic now to
read the books which deluded Englishmen
wrote about that garish Young Turk in the
days when he was doing the Boulanger act.
Being quite mad, the Turk is provoking
Greece to war by expelling Greek subjects
wholesale from its territories, and by threat-
ening a general massacre of Christians if an
Allied fleet appears before Constantinople.
As the Christians thereabouts are very largely
Greeks and Italians, two enraged nations are
being almost driven to do sudden things to
the Turk. . The war on the Belgian and Alsa-
tian frontiers is the same dogged and inter-
minable slaughter. The Allies keep moving
ahead, but before one backyard is taken the
said backyard is full of dead. Still the
French appear to be over the border and a
little way into German territory. In Britain
politicians talk more and more about
compulsory military service. France is dig-
ging up another half-million recruits —the
boys of the young brigade who have just
reached the rifle-carrying age. Russia is
also calling out its new crop of recruits —
some 800,000 in all. Both these countries
have able-bodied men left, but some must
be held in reserve to manage railways and
repair roads and keep the food supply and
some absolutely necessary manufacturing
industries going. So the kid is going to the
Front. In the spring, when the young man
lightly turns to thoughts of love, it is
hoped that the Allies will be ready for an
effort compared to which all they have done
yet will be small potatoes, and few in a
hill. And by that time it is hoped that
there will be two new Allies, for those
chronic waiters-upon-events, Italy and Rou-
mania, show signs of realising that they
must do something if they hope to be in at
the division of the spoil. The Turks and
Germans are reported to be sinking ships
loaded with road metal to block the Dardan-
elles, and are thus spoiling one of the finest
harbors in the world for a decayed Sultan’s
holiday. It is mentioned casually that the
Germans have looted the ruined little land
of Belgium for nearly £80,000,000 in cash
contributions. The Germans are adepts at
the art of “living on the enemy’s country.”
Being the same old miserable blunderers as
previously they have angered the whole
Catholic world by the arrest of a Belgian
Cardinal who told his flock that Belgium
isn’t. German territory, and that allegiance
is still due to the National Government. A
few more loans of a few more scores of
millions have lately been floated. By this
time all the loose cash in the world has
been borrowed twice over. The commander
whose star has been rising most steadily
during the last few weeks is the Grand Duke
Nicholas, of Russia. He is manipulating
a battle line which extends, with occasional
intervals, from the Baltic to the Caspian—
a line about 1000 miles long. The recent
results suggest that Nicholas is a hard
Grand Duke to beat, and that he entirely
fills the definition of man as “an animal of
large discourse looking before and after.”
The dailies seem to have suppressed all
reference to the way in which the news of
the attack by two Turks on a Broken Hill
excursion train was received in Hogmany.
The following official statement was issued
in Berlin, where the news created great
enthusiasm :
, A notable success has been achieved by our arms
in Australia, near Broken Hill, where a force of
Turks surprised and put to flight a superior force
which was being transported by rail. Forty of the
enemy were killed and 70 wounded; the casualties
amongst the Turks being only two killed. Broken
Hill is an important mining centre and port on the
west coast of Australia. The success of our arms
practically assures the control of the valuable metal
mines in the neighborhood, and leaves the way open
for an attack on Candbris, the capital of Australia,
and its most strongly-fortified centre; although
owing to the flooded condition of the country an
attack may be impossible until next spring.

On Friday evening, at Sydney Criterion,
aE the other Joneses are invited by the
management to pay for their own tickets to
watch the absorbing spectacle of another
Jones coming home drunk. The Jones Who
gets, the glad eye from a female Jones in the
audience will be quite safe if he opens con-
versation with the otherwise hackneyed re-
mark : “Excuse me, haven’t I met you before?
Aren’t you Miss Jones?”

"The Girl on the Film” still flicks at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney. An evening at this
show, with Dorothy Brunton, Field Fisher,
and the rest, is one of the pleasantest
methods of getting eye-strain that could be
imagined.
_ “Seven Little Australians” are still run-
ning along happily at the Sydney Palace
matindes, and the proud, fatherly smile worn
by Beaumont Smith just about the time
when the takings are counted is a beautiful
sight to see. The evening bill for bald-
headed babes who are off the milk-bottle is
to be changed on Saturday from “Who’s the
Lady?” to “The Chaperon.”
'l* •!” ❖ *!•
“Dorothy o’ the Hall” will throw the
dinner through the Sydney Royal window
for the last time on Friday night. On Satur-
day Nellie Stewart starts a four-nights’ re-
vival of “Du Barry,” and after that the
season concludes with two nights of the
evergreen “Sweet Nell of Old Drury.”
“The Babes in the Wood” are doing as
much business as. usual, which means that
Sydney Adelphi is too small to hold the
crowd that is having a good time while Wil-
loughby’s pantomime and Holman’s loan
last. When the loan-jug comes home empty
pantos, will be among the things that will
not be regarded as strictly necessary com-
modities. Wherefore, do it now. Two
shows daily.

J. W. Rickaby, the comedian at whom
any compliments that haven’t already been
flung aren’t worth flinging, is back at Sydney
Tivoli, putting a pinch of much-needed ginger
into the Follies. Alexander Yakovlenko,
who sounds like a Russian victory but is
really a capital whirlwind dancer, is giving
Rickaby a hand to resuscitate the show.
A. new dance has been added by Jean Keith,
hitherto the unknown “wee Australian
Lassie” ; and Isabelle D’Armond is off for-
a while, her place being filled by Miss Eileen
Watson, an Australian, who does it nicely.
“WHO'S THE LADY?"
AT SYDNEY PALACE.
Uctabe discovers the disaavantages of Love-
making through an interpreter.
“W.D.” goes to the play at Newtown
Bridge and comes home breathless:—
The villain puts £5O in the hero’s desk and calls
in a policeman, who is brushed away by the hero,
who bolts and ruins himself and is found in London
by the father of his girl, who is taken by a nun
(still unruined) to a home for the Lost where an
unfortunate who has stolen a watch has gone to lead
a new life. The nun comes to the villain’s home and
tells him the hero is the rightful heir, and that the
heroine has got a job in the house as maid, but the
assistant villain arrives and tells her that the hero
is very ill, and though the comic man dominates
the villain with a pistol while the hero’s mother
arrives disguised as a nun, the assistant villain takes
the heroine to London, where the comic man meets
the hero’s mother, who had gone mad years before
in the U.S.A. But the heroine’s father arrives to
look for the hero, and buys a newspaper while the
hero is being starved to death, and the assistant
villain makes disgraceful proposals to the heroine in
a basement with his hat on, and almost immediately
afterwards he is thrown down by a newsboy, and
the hero fires three shots from the river at some
snide asylum attendants while the boat is held by
a heavy drinker. Meanwhile the comic man gets
£20,000 out of a bag, which was being taken away,
and the hero’s mother says she was undoubtedly
married to the villain’s brother, and that for the
sake of his father’s name he must be spared.

Considering that Sydney had practically
danced itself off its feet during the last
couple of years, the prospects of another
dahce-hall did not look over bright. How-
ever, the White City at Rushcutter’s Bay de-
cided to take the risk, and its ballroom has
turned out to be one of the best paying
sidelines in the amusement park.
* * * *
Mainly about Sydney moving pictures:—
Crystal Palace: “The Battle of the Sexes,” a
“powerful four-reel problem play for adults,” con-
cerning the married man who knew so little about
the wife of the fellow next door that he ran away
with her.
Lyric : “Ancient Order of Goodfellows,” dealing
with a crook, a policeman and a leetle cheeild.
Colonial: “The Wolf’s Daughter,” all ditto, ex-
cept that the cheeild is a few years older.
Empress: “Gipsy Child,” more ditto. Only there
are no police present. This makes it much more
natural.
Of course there are other things ; but these
are the ones you are expected to talk about
on the way home.

“Cinderella,” with its fair girls and fine
dresses, its few faults and many redeeming
qualities, is still having the time of its life
at Her Majesty’s (Melbourne). The original
numbers (which is a better word than
members). of the cast are refraining from
indisposition, as a rule ; but on one matinee
occasion last week Miss Gertie Latchford
gave her understudy a chance. This
accounted for a slight falling-off in the humor
of the. Sisters’ Dewdrop songandance turn;
for Miss Latchford, as the demure, lydylike
Dewdrop of old music-hall days, is about
the best joke in the panto. Dolly Harmer,
disguised as the saucy male-impersonating
Dewdrop, is the second best joke.

At Melbourne Royal the broken bedroom
door of Mrs. Robert Stafford continues to
emphasise the adage that love laughs at
locksmiths. Also the fact that luxury eats
into the bones of its victims is asserted in
the same simple manner as before. More-
over, the case of Mrs. James Gilley, after
her empty-headed husband has lost his fat
billet, reminds us that whereas Fanny in
her hours of ease is quite an easy thing to
please, she soon becomes a shrewish cat
when poverty waits on the mat. In short,
“Boug’ht and Paid For,” the thrilling, throb-
bing, improbable drama of domestic life will
keep on being presented every evening until
further notice, and the weekly matinee will
eventuate on Wednesdays.
Frank Bradley in “ Who's the Lady? ”
At Melbourne King’s the marching
of the Allies has become a notable
feature of the show, and the gambols
of the coryphees and kiddies have im-
proved out of knowledge since the
first night. “Sinbad” as it stands,
adapted and Kaiser-gagged by Alf Lumsden,
only needs a little more expensiveness in the
scenery and costume departments to make it
sufficiently gorgeous as well as bright. The
songs of Rita Renas, Ralston and Burgess,
in particular, are either sweet or catchy, or
both, and the rotund jollity of Maggie Moore
is a host in itself. The Demon King (Ossi-
poff) sings as a demon should, his orthodox
minions work with enthusiasm, and little
Minnie Mitchell is the most winsome Aus-
tralian nipper who has phenomenalised since
Fanny Powers was a child. At a time when
a second panto, in Melbourne might have
seemed bound to suffer cold neglect, it is good
to find the Andersonian -venture prospering
on its merits.
* * * *
The tame, chaotic entertainment which
Yestelle rushed into notice at Melbourne
Athenaeum Hall has changed its spots con-
siderably since the first night; but the mark
of the amateur is on its brow, and it does
the things it ought not to have done, and
there is small hope in it. The trouble begins
as before with a decent suburban musical-
evening performance. This would seem less
of a “crimson rhapsody” (in a cursory way
of speaking) if Miss Mollie Locke’s clever
singing at the piano were introduced into
the middle of it, instead of being served up
later. Yestelle’s silent tale of “the East”
is now wagged in the centre of the pro-
gramme, and the lady’s paucity of glad rags
suggests an exciting time ahead, when her
curves will be even less obscured. A new
Prince —vice Robert White—has the easy job
of getting enamored of Yestelle as soon as
that clingsome spinster comes along. The
new rooster turns out to be our old friend
Brown, of the Bland Holt dramas, who sub-
sequently pops up as a colonel in the Revue
which terminates this strange, eventful
mystery. White is the new waiter in the
Revue, and he and Brown strive their best
to be grimly jocular what time the six chorus
ladies are not protruding covered legs through
apertures in bonnet-boxes or putting on
black silk stockings when their limbs
are bare. In a revue girls are expected
to wear stockings; therefore Yestelle takes
no part in this final section of the proceed-
ings. It would be a breach of propriety,
under the circs., for her to put a pair on
whilst the audience was looking.

At Melbourne Princess’s “The Night Side
of London” is giving further publicity to the
peripatetic fiddler and his mute companion
who are united in a desire to throttle Stein-
berg. The Hebrew, it is learnt, deeply in-
jured the pair by embezzling their bits of
muslin for an alleged typewriting empor-
ium in a London suburb. The fact that
the inhabitants type little, but are doomed
to supply endearments to dissipated old men,
affords the wandering pair with the motive
for the r-revenge which they, of course,
accomplish with crimson thoroughness in
the end. Steinberg is finished off in a real-
istic manner, after spending much time in
foaming dread of the retribution relent-
lessly pursuing him in two pairs of battered
boots. The proceedings are mostly flecked
with the froth of the tevrib'd .Jew. and
Rutland Beckett tries to do justice to the
part by working himself up iw> a aimer of
disquiet and gnashing his whiskers at fre-
quent intervals. Incidentally Rutland’s tre-
pidation is almost approached by the blue
funk of the sweet young heroine when the
bat employer of her professional services
demonstrates an unseemly palate for femin-
ine titbits. Those who enjoy a spectacle of
outraged virtue with rolling eyeballs and dis-
hevelled hair ought to buy a seat at the
Princess’s to-night or to-morrow. On Satur-
day Steinberg’s tart factory will be closed,
and “A. Girl’s Temptation” will commence a
week’s run.
On the plank in Sydney Adelphi Panto.
Melbourne Tivoli bill was strengthened last
Saturday by the Randell-Jackson concertists
who sing a,nd do much the same things as the
dandy daffodil pierrots do at the seaside.
Three men and two girls perform in ones or
twos or altogether, and their work is neat
and artistic throughout. Odiva and the sea-
lions are tanking as before; but Wright and
Dietrich, the spoonful duettists, are going
elsewhere to tell the audience how they dote
on one another. Of the remaining people
who have not yet lost the bloom of novelty
Laura. Guerite is most beloved. The astound-
ing thing about Laura is that whilst claim-
ing to have been the earliest singer of one
particular song, she hasn’t yet learned to
get the most out of it. Not that it would be
very much of a ditty if she had.

At. Melbourne Bijou the Grafters are
creating as much riot as their voices and
feet will permit in a new musical burlesque,
“Fun .on the Farm.” This particular travesty
is . thin and foolish, but Bijou audiences
relish it with a penn’orth of peanuts and an
icecream sandwich. In the rest of the - bill
Ella Airlie is a conspicuous attraction,
while Skipper Francis has a lot to say for
himself as a champion swimmer. Skipper
declares that he showed great nerve in
swimming the Bristol Channel, and is appar-
ently putting up his present feat of elo-
quence to prove his allegation.

The most presentable items at Hoyt’s
National, Melbourne, this week are “Plain
Mary,” the yarn of the ugly duckling all
over again, and “Out of the Darkness,” a
long burglar story calculated to make W.
Sikes very sorry for his calling. At the
Olympia the Hoyt people are showing “Their
Only Son,” a patriotic drama with a topical
moral, and “The Heroine of Mons,” a san-
guinary war film that makes Ypres look
like a curate’s garden.

The brief bucking-up of Adelaide theatres
was soon over; and a lot of visiting players,
after a fortnight of perfect weather, inquired
why they had been told that the city is hot
in summer. “Bunty” has moved on to
Broken Hill after doing splendid business.
Wirths’ Circus has found its houses increas-
ing steadily as it has moved westward, and,
as it is now going to the Farthest West, the
omen should be all right. The lioness
earned the Baby Bonus five-fold at Christmas
time. The King’s, once more enjoying a
sort of monopoly, has a lot of new artists,
•with Elton Fox and Walter Champney pro-
minent among them. In the open air,
Branscombe’s Dandies and Waller’s Strollers
compete pleasantly. Both have a steady
public which drops in every so-often, assured
of finding something good. The Strollers
have one big advantage in Ivanoff’s bril-
liant fiddling and the string orchestra he
leads. The rest is picture shows—good, but
for the moment not great.
The Tas. Labor Government, which has
just completed its tenth month in office
failed to get the usual Parliamentary Christ-
mas gift of a. recess. The House of Lords
could have finished the business by working
a few hours overtime on Christmas Eve; but
the rules of the House of Lords Union or
weariness or something intervened, and the
two .Houses must meet again for a day or
two in the middle of January to tie up the
loose ends of the small and somewhat un-
tidy parcel of legislation which the session
has produced. At least, it is presumed that
the. tying of the loose ends will be the only
business of the January meeting; but with
the life of the Government depending upon
one erratic Whitsitt, a crisis may be cre-
ated at any moment. Still, the odds appear
to be in favor of the Earle Government
getting into recess for a few months, as all
parties, including the Whitsitt party of one,
suspect that the electors are getting pretty
sick of elections, and are likely to make
mincemeat of the political party that unduly
disturbs the summer siesta. There was a
general election in January, 1912; another
in January, 1913; and a by-election (Deni-
son) in January, 1914. Another disturb-
ance in January. 1915, would bo regarded
as the absolute limit, especially as the pre-
sent Parliament dies a natural death early
in 1916.

AT POVERTY POINT.
“0.K.”: Hugh Buckler could give some
interesting facts touching the “annexation
of Shakspeare by Germany,” whereof
“J.F.H.” speaks (B. 31/12/Y4). Buckler
was a member of the Beerbohm Tree co.
when it travelled to Berlin with all the
scenery and fixings to produce one or two
Shakspeare plays, the Kaiser paying the
piper. The co. was made feel like a band
of intruders in a German domain of art. It
was distinctly hinted that no English person
knew how any Shakspearian thing should be
done. The performances, however, seemed
to be an eye-opener to the Berlin scoffers,
and the visit of Tree and co. left Ger-
many’s higher culture in doubt as to whether
there was not an English side to the question.
German self-conceit in this matter received
a great impetus long years ago, when the
Duke of Saxe-Meiningen’s Court co. went to
London to play “Julius Caesar” in particu-
lar. Cockney criticism gushed over the Ger-
mans’ organisation. But there was nothing
great in the individual performances:
Brutus, Antony, Caesar, Cassius and the rest
were as stodgily serious as the average Ger-
man opera singer. Teutons are not born
theatrical artists, from a British point of
view, like the French and Italians. The
crowd was just a well-drilled mass of fairly
intelligent actors, and the lesson they
brought to London was taken to heart. To-
day Oscar Asche could stage-manage “Julius
Caesar” better than it was done by the pro-
ducer who went back to Germany with a
swelled head.
“Parisine”: Apropos the engagement of
Seymour Hicks and Ellaline Terriss, with
their comic opera co., to perform for the
soldiers in France. After certain experi-
ences in Martinique, the island of Josephine,
Miss Montansier became a Parisian
actress, much favored by the aristocracy.
Her project to build a great theatre in
Paris was quashed by the Revolution. With
Thespian versatility, she became a democrat,
and volunteered for the war, with her whole
company, which numbered 86, including
musicians and stage hands. Robespierre,
Danton and co. thought it a good idea. The
company went, and the actors fought as well
as played. Yet Miss Montansier got into
quad, and only Robespierre’s fall saved her,
Josephine and Mrs. Tallien from the
guillotine. She entered theatrical manage-
ment again, and made lots of money, so that
it is alleged Bonaparte would have married
her but for Barras throwing Josephine and
the Italian command in his way.
“J.F.H.” (from London) : The Melbourne
elocutionist, Carrie Haase, has covered her-
self with glory in Thomas Hardy’s tremen-
dous Napoleonic drama of “The Dynasts.”
About nine-tenths of the original had to be
cut out, but Granville Barker cleverly
bridged the gaps by means of a “Reader”
seated in front of the stage, and a couple
of ladies, acting as “chorus,” and facing
each other from opposite sides. One of the
two is the Australian. Henry Ainey, the
finest elocutionist of the contemporary stage,
achieved a triumph as the “Reader,” while
there is general agreement with the West-
minster Gazette, which says that “Miss
Carrie Haase and Miss Esme Beringer, as
the chorus, delivered their poetic speeches
superbly. There were moments,” it adds,
“when the three produced quite a tremen-
dous effect.”
“Carmine”: For the success of panto-
mime, look to the scenic artist! The list
of those who have excelled in Australia be-
gins with Opie, whom Coppin brought from
Launceston in 1845. Then came from Lon-
don W. J. Wilson and Pitt, father of the
latter-day theatrical architect. Holmes and
Fry were also men of the period. Then
arose Hennings. He was not trained as a
scenic artist, but took first place, although
George Gordon, from London, excelled him
in landscape. George was well succeeded
by son John. Brough and Boucy brought
forward admirable Spong, Hilda’s father.
Bland Holt was chief employer of Brunton.
And Goatcher and Coleman have made
their name, while Robins, Grist, Mann and
Little, without aspiring to be amid the top-
most sawyers, have done serviceable work.
Nor let us quite forget Ben Tannett and
his son Joe.
“M.”: In the revival of “The Country
Girl,” at Daly?s (London), Tom Walls, of
“The Arcadians,” and much-photographed
Gertie Millar are in the cast; and the
Potentate from Bhong is played by
Bantock, who was in Australia 20 years
ago with Maud Hobson, Decima Moore,
Fred Kaye and Harry Monkhouse, when
Granville Bantock (now one of England’s
foremost composers) held the baton.
Another Bantock, Claud, was the original

“Harrison O.”: When a theatre usher
hands me a glossary along with my pro-
gramme I always regret that I have given up
carrying a sling-shot when in evening dress.
I don’t expect any “star” mime to make him-
or herself audible, but I do ask that, to
understand what dialogue I chance to hear I
should not be compelled to consult some
managerial document with the aid of an
electric torch. When “The Chorus Lady,”
now at Melbourne Royal, announces, “You
never hear me leading the anvil chorus,” I
have to conduct a search of the glossary
(which is not alphabetically arranged) to
ascertain what it’s all about. Is this
slanguage really in general use in the
United Skites, or is it the invention of
Yankee playwrights who think that to be
clever you must be unintelligible?
It has now come to light that the
“Viennese” and “Blue Hungarian” bands
which London was supposed to insist on
were mostly composed of good Englishmen.
One term of the contract imposed on them
by their swindling employers was that they
must never speak a word of English during
the performance ! The contempt of the old
bad-Australian for anything “colonial”
seems to have been fairly matched by the
British contempt for anything British.
“ CINDERELLA ,” AT HER MAJESTY’S ,
MELBOURNE.

“H. 0.”: The female of the claqueur species
is very prominent in Melbourne theatres just
now ; not in the audience, but on the stage.
The panto, managements, recognising the
necessity of securing bogus merriment if they
can’t command the real, have thoughtfully
arranged that whenever a comedian is on the
stage with intent to commit a witticism,
there shall be three or four chorus ladies on
hand to make glad noises, and so encourage
the audience to do likewise. Wheezes decor-
ated with the moss of senility and the
whiskers of old age call forth squeaks of
laughter from the carefully-trained girls,
although it is obvious the poor dears are suf-
fering as acutely as everybody else. It is
hard enough to earn money by being
amusing, but consider the anguish of earning
it by being amused.
“Norbell”: Every itinerant dramatic co.
has the old play originally named “Current
Cash.” It has done yeoman or dead-beat
service in Australia for many years, and is
sure to be working overtime now. The
scene of the prologue is laid in a warlike
British encampment in Afghanistan, but it
has the virtue of being easily shifted from
Pekin to Ladysmith or Timbuctoo or the
Modder River. With the scene the title is
changed. I have met the dear old friend
as “In the Ranks,” “Shoulder to Shoulder,”
“With the Colors,” “The Bugle Call,” “With
Flying Colors,” “Called to Arms,” Under
Fire,” “The Clash of Arms,” “Held by the
Enemy,” “Tommy Atkins,” “For King and
Country,” “Death or Glory,” “The Roll of
the Drum,” “For the Flag.” “The Heart of
a Hero,” “For England’s Glory,’ and so on.
I encountered the old warrior up on the
Northern Rivers a few weeks ago, disguised
as “A Soldier and a Man,” and the dead
certainty is that he will blow in again with
the battle scene shifted to Belgium, and
nominating himself “The Blutwurst War
Lord.”
A few weeks ago a theatrical big-wig in
Melbourne received an application for a
place in a popular dramatic co. The appli-
cant, a lady, wrote: “I believe I can act,
and my feet are two sizes smaller than
Bernhardt’s.”
“Stalls”: I am forming a Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Musical Con-
ductors. The guying of the conductor is
neither fair dealing nor good art. It is a
sort of hold-up whereby one who is in much
the same privileged position as a parson
makes capital out of the natural embarrass-
ment of a busy man who isn’t privileged to
answer back. It is almost as bad as the old
trick of singling out somebody in the audi-
ence who has paid money to be entertained
and turning him into entertainment for
others. For a start, I wonder how many
musical conductors Daisy Jerome has baited
and made uncomfortable?
“ CINDERELLA.”
The Baron (Jack
Ale Arche) in disguise.

enjoy the panto.
“Stargazer”: A hot dispute arose in the
carriage over the merits of a certain
theatrical performance. The little fellow
in the corner was particularly vicious. He
expressed his firm conviction, as a man and
a Christian, that every participant in the
performance, including producer, leader of
the orchestra, limelight man and check-
taker, should be boiled in one large cauldron.
He made an exception in the case of the
manager—he might be given a separate caul-
dron. “But,” said the ginger stockbroker,
holding up his paper, “it says here that the
show is first-class, and is drawing large and
delighted audiences.” The little man in the
corner waxed even more murderous. “Well,”
said he, “what if it does? I’d merely boil
the infernal critic with the rest of the mess.”
The little man in the corner was well within
his rights here. He happened to be the
critic.
From London: A truly-English idea is to
eat for the benefit of war-victims. The
Playgoers, O.P. and other dramatic clubs
are going to “dine” Tree, who has been very
generous with the “Drake” gate-money. The
guests will pay 12s. 6d. each, hear some good
soup and speeches, and see the Era and
Stage funds get a lift. Half Belgium and
a good slice of France now being in Eng-
land, the Evening News joins the Echo de
France in promoting a play by actors of
the two visiting countries, and a regular
Belgian season —played in French, of course
—at the Criterion has the patronage of the
Daily Telegraph. Kennerley Rumford has
gone to the front, and his place in the Butt
concerts is filled by a mere elocutionist.
Frederic Worlock, the caliph in “Kismet,”
has gone, too. A picture-house has had its
license refused because three directors out
of seven are Germans, and an English-acted
film has been built round the “Tipperary”
song. “Cecil Raleigh” had a big funeral.
It is stated by old friends that his real
name was Abraham Cecil Francis Fothergill
Rowlands. The fatal cancer in his throat
is surmised to have been caused by never-
ending cigarettes. He was only 58. Another
long sufferer just released is Arthur Bin-
stead, of the cerulean Pink ’Un till he
founded Town Topics. If you have _ a
sense of humor and are not over-worried
about morals, you should read his books.
“Private Boxer”: Bernard Shaw has been
singularly quiet, not to say subdued, since
the war began. I fancy he is busy turning
an honest penny by writing sketches for
London music-halls. At any rate, a patri-
otic drama in five scenes, “The Bloody
Beast of Berlin,” was lately being per-
formed at one of the big vaudeville houses,
and there is internal evidence against Shaw
in the title.
Granville Barker continues to find a job
when he can for “Billy” Moore, the Mel-
bourne Herald man, who first introduced
the modern Australian playlet to the foot-
lights. Billy has been playing three little
parts in “The Dynasts” in London. There
are over 90 characters in Thomas Hardy’s
vast commotion, so the actor from the Anti-
podes amounts to hardly more than 3 per
cent, of the cast.
“B. J.” : A church and stage coalition just
now exists in Melbourne, where the veteran
Charlie Taylor, of Taylor and Carrington
fame, and the Rev. David Hennessey are
fixing up a stage version of the latter’s
novel, “The Outlaw,” which annexed a
prize of £4OO in a recent competition run
by Hodder and Stoughton.
Another stage veteran, Arthur Williams,
is publishing reminiscences in London. He
played with Barry Sullivan, Charles Dillon,
and other eminent top-liners who linger in
the memories of old Australian playgoers.
Also he was associated with Joseph, the
father of well-beloved Ethel Irving. He de-
scribes Joseph as an “excellent comedian, a
good singer, and a marvellous dancer”; so
the lady owes something to heredity. Her
father’s Uriah Heep is referred to as a
“masterpiece of character acting.”
Jennie Lee, the original Jo in the well-
known stage version of Dickens’s “Bleak
House,” is still alive and flicking, so to
speak. Recently she figured prominently in
a Yankee motion picture called “The
Clansman,” and played her part with all her
old-time force and feeling. “Jo” is now in
her 66th year. She was a moderately
plump little woman of 40 the last time she
came to Australia, when, by the way, she
played principal boy in a Williamson panto,
after her “Jo” company had disbanded.
Australian artist-poet Hugh McCrae, who
left Australia a few months ago to bombard
New York editors with drawings and verses,
has adjourned to the stage. According to
the last mail he was to appear as Admiral-
of-the-Fleet in “The Garden of Paradise,” a
spectacular production of Hans Andersen’s
“The Little Mermaid,” under the jurisdic-
tion of the Liebler Co. Tasmanian Harry
Neville is the stage-manager, and South
Australian O. P. Heggie is producer. Two
others in the same co. —Littledale Power and
George Relph—have been seen in Australia,
the latter with the Asche-Brayton Co.
The second-youngest son of Henry Parkes,
sometimes Premier of N. S. Wales, was
married to Miss Rush, a Clarence River
girl, the other day. The youngster is a
Henry, too.
“Old Soldier” :
Lord Rosebery would do a good deal better if he
would not mix his metaphors. The cable says he
told a Seotch audience lately: “Britain and Germany
were fighting with their backs to the wall.” How?
They couldn’t fight if they both had their backs to
the same wall, and if they had their backs to
different walls opposite each other they would be
cramped for room if the walls were close together,
and out of range if the walls were far apart. For
instance, the Englishman with his back to Dumbar-
ton Castle and the German with his back to Cologne
Cathedral would be quite harmless. The exalted
Scotch politician seems to have been confused
between the necessity for making out a strong case
for more voluntary recruits and the necessity for
impressing on his audience the absolute certainty
that the Germans must be beaten whatever happens.
A new Anglican bishop for Jerusalem has
just been consecrated —Canon Maclnnes,
who formerly worked with the brilliant
young Australian doctor, Maynard Pain
(now deceased) at the old Cairo Mission
Hospital. The new bishop will not wear
his gaiters in the Holy City for some time,
as William the Bloodstained’s latest ally is
making the climate of Jerusalem unhealthy
at present for Christian dogs. This Jerusa-
lem Bishopric, when first founded in the
’4o’s of last century, nearly caused a split
in the Anglican Church. The original
scheme was that the British and German
Governments were to join in providing the
endowment and were to appoint the holder
alternately. Kaiser Bill’s ancestor of the
time proposed to nominate a Lutheran pas-
tor, much to the horror of English “high
churchmen.” The arrangement broke down,
and for many years English missionary
societies and piously inclined individuals
have paid the piper and called the
tune and the doxology. ' The first
bishop was to be sent out by the
British Government in a warship, to impress
the Turks and others; but when he found
that the ship told off to carry him was the
Infernal he jibbed. The Admiralty blandly
offered him the Devastation, instead —an
appropriate vessel in which to bring an-
other bishop to add his claims to those of
the rival bosses of sects and heresies who
squabble on the tomb of the Prince of Peace
and have to be separated at specially holy
seasons by Turkish guards with fixed
bayonets.
THE TEARS OF BERLIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A gala night at the Opera Royal was arranged
during the German Emperor’s stay in Berlin, but
when the opening scene of “Lohengrin” commenced,
instead of cheers a storm of hysterical laughter and
weeping swept over the house.” — Cable.
The Emperor spoke: “Though scourged with many
a stripe,
Though much is lost and nothing worthy gained,
The time for our official joy is ripe—
Let us be entertained.”
With stiff, set smiles the public booked its seat,
From stall to gallery the house was filled.
None from commanded gladness dared retreat
Till Bill the movement willed.
Without, the newsboys yelled their doubtful tale
Of stars of victory in east and west;
Within, official gaiety sat pale,
The Kaiser with the rest.
The tingling fiddles stung the hard-drawn nerves,
The trombone “pomed” dismay to heart and brain,
The shrill flute piped to call the last reserves
Of memory and pain.
In Flanders death sat grinning o’er the mud,
In Poland many graves were very new;
Smiling officially, men heard raw blood
Dripping the music through.
The lights went down. A silence held the throng
Like the cold hush before the tempest breaks,
Such proud official mirth must needs be strong
So bitterly it aches!
The curtain rose. The pent-up feeling found
A sudden vent in sobs and blinding tears.
Emotion, hot and unofficial, drowned
The music for all ears.
In Flanders death sat cold upon the flood,
Far Polish graves with Teuton dead were full,
And watchful vengeance yet should purge in blood
The shame of Hartlepool.
The curtain fell. In unofficial tears
The crowd passed out into the winter dark,
And hate’s cold weapon forged in kindlier years
Returned to find its mark.
In Paris widows wept. On Belgian soil
Men blindly cursed above their tortured slain.
Berlin foresaw destruction’s red recoil
In passion fierce as vain.
Like some grey wolf, fang-bare before the chase,
That of no choice must grimly ■ stand at bay,
The German looked his treason in the face
And rued the bitter day.
Sure as the night crept on the sword of doom,
Tempered fh human scorn as in a flame.
The world’s best promise was his nation’s tomb —
A tomb of blood and shame !

Henry Stead, in the Australian Review
oe Reviews complains of Australian educa-
tion :
At one time history meant British history. Now
it means Australian history; and for a growing
number of boys and girls the history of the world
begins with the landing of Captain Cook at Botany
Bay, and they know nothing about the landing of
Caesar in Kent.
Well, the landing of Lieutenant Cook at
Botany Bay at least produced one result:
He stole the continent of New Holland from
the Dutchmen, and hoisted the British flag,
and as a result of his doings the place
became Australia. From that reckless deed
of Lieutenant Cook it came to pass that
there is, for the first time in all history, a
whole continent under one Government, and
one flag, and possessing one language. Cook
THE ONLY WORD TO EXPRESS IT.
GERMAN GENERAL: “Vot is your name, aind't it?”
RUSSIAN PRISONER : " Ivan Gregoriski Petropoluskivitch."
GERMAN GENERAL: “ Vere you gome from, yes, no?"
RUSSIAN PRISONER : “ Nickovaliskipetropski, near Validaviskigirganitza."
GERMAN GENERAL: "Lo[?] struth!”
might have been a high-handed thief and an
impolite stealer of Holland’s possessions;
still, lie laid the foundations of something
that the globe never saw before so far as
we know, and may never see again. As for
Caesar, he made two hurried expeditions into
Kent, and hurried out again. He was a
Dago failure. He didn’t amount, so far as
England was concerned, to a terrace of false
teeth, and it was fully 100 years after his
time that the Romans really set out to
conquer England. Why should the Austra-
lian infant spend the bulk of his time in
learning that a bankrupt epileptic made two
futile raids on Kent (England) nearly 2000
years ago? It would be equally to the point
if the English infant spent his time in learn-
ing how the people of Crete went to Pales-
tine before Rome was born. They at least
made history in the country they went to.
Before this war is a year old the Butcher
of Berlin will arrive at the sad conclusion
that his six sons are half a dozen dangers to
German Culture. Even loyal Germans must
by then perceive the absurdity of fighting for
a Kaiser who is always exhorting masses of
soldiers to Do or Die while his own hulking
bunch of sons continues to live on. Berlin is
talking already about the cruel luck of some
Bavarian parents who have gone into mourn-
ing for three sons out of four, or four out of
five. When a soured citizen, smarting under
a keen sense of injustice, goes around ask-
ing : “Ain’t the Kaiser going to lose none ?”
the crowd will begin to laugh. And when
Germany can laugh at its swanking War
Lord a revolution will be in the air. If the
Kaiser owned a sense of humor he would
make his sons draw lots, and the one who
drew the shortest straw would have to lead
a forlorn hope and fall riddled with bullets.
By way of throwing the ripe fish back into
the mouths of those who denounce Young
Australia for not waking up as the youth
have done in England, The Bulletin prints
this note from “Rosna,” an Australian
woman in London :
“England, Awake!” and other cries of the kind
are plastered all over the face of London in letters
from three to six feet high. But dear old Mother
still sleeps on. Football thrives as much as ever,
and at a recent match at Chelsea with 15,000 spec-
tators, and at another on the Arsenal ground with
10,000 lookers-on, prominent speakers were able to
capture but one lone recruit! The streets are
crammed with creatures airing their socks and their
leisure. It makes one positively ill to think of our
own good, brave Australian men giving up good
billets to come and fight, while this riff-raff looks on.
English women have been called helpless fools, but
they re giving their men points in this emergency.
There’s hardly one in a thousand that isn’t doing
something—if it’s only making socks such as never
were oh land or sea.

“W.8.D.” pictures the place where the
tide turned :—■
In days to come the valley of the Grand Morin
will be visited by pilgrims, for it was there that
the tide of Germanism was rolled back and Western
civilisation was saved from the barbarian. The
Parisian knows it well. In summer time its villages
and the hills which rise above the river are the
resort of villa dwellers sheltering from the city
heats. Crecy-en-Brie and Villers-Monbarbin are about
..
three quarters of an hour from Pans by odd little
two-decker trains. A side rail runs up the narrow
valley and comes to an end at Crecy. The line
branches at Esbly, which is at the valley’s mouth
and on the main line to the frontier. Through
Esbly passed most of the men and artillery when
France mobilised. Just outside the station is a
tunnel, and during the first few days of August
reckless attempts were made by roving Germans to
blow it up. Had they succeeded it would have dis-
organised the mobilisation, which was the chief de-
sign of German strategy.
The Morin is only about 60 feet wide, though it
carries a great volume of water by reason of its
depth. The pleasantest house upon its banks is the

brow, “We have been poisoned with them here-
ahouts.” He had caught three that morning. The
pleasantest village is Monbarbin, the complement of
Villers. It clings to a cliff-like hillside and in the
distance looks like the mediaeval eyries of Italy and
Sicily. To the twin villages ladies of the French
stage come with their impermanent lords to affect
the simple life, and awhile live lives of almost
stilted innocence, fishing for tiny “ablettes” by the
riverside, rising and retiring early, drinking and
eating sparingly and well. In summer days the
very air shimmers with the sprightly zest of France
at pky-
The products of the place are three. The Fromage
de Brie, the famous plate-shaped cheese, is one.
The second is the Berger de Brie, a replica of what
is called in England the Old English Sheep-dog. On
the 26tb of August, 1346, the English fought at
Crecy—not at Crecy-en-Brie, but another Crecy
Which lies about 20 miles northward. We may have
got the dogs then. If so one of the most typical of
Britishers is really a quasi-Parisian in disguise,
The third product is fruit of many kinds. Some of
it goes to Paris; most of it to Covent Garden.
With the Morin is associated the most remarkable
coincidence of the war. It is the stream which is
held responsible for the periodical floodings of the
Seme at Pans, and a Parisian saying goes: “When
the flood on the Morin subsides Paris is saved.”

, That quaint animal, the Victorian honorar-
ium, has just scored one. Several of him
were invited by the Railway authorities to
deal with the usual batch who had travelled
first-class on second-class tickets. In real
fact, the Department was the offender, be-
cause it had taken the passengers’ money
and hadn’t provided them with seats in
second-class carriages. On that the honorar-
iums inspected the matter from all angles
and finally, though some of the accused had
pleaded guilty, they dismissed the charges
on the ground that the criminals hadn’t
taken seats in the carriage—they had been
obliged to stand for lack of room*' The De-
partment, being much upset by the decision

The Nile goes by in a lazy dream,
A sinuous grace on her loit’ring stream ;
The sands lift up from the desert lone
And far and wide on the tents are blown.
The graven gods in the temples grim,
So stern of lip and so stark of limb,
Look down and gaze on the camp and smile,
For they and the Sphinx and the murm’ring Nile,
They knew the day when the Grecian came,
His wit as wine and his sword as flame;
They saw the eagles of mighty Rome,
Her galleys sunder the seething foam.
They gazed once more when the Moslem swept
And the pale-faced priests of the Christian wept.
They watched the finger of slow decay,
Token patent of Islam’s sway ;
And ever the Sphinx looked o’er the land,
And ever would rise the driving sand
And bury the hall and the shrine decayed,
And hide the tracks by the eonqu’ror made.

That curiously inefficient thing, the
Panama Canal, has fallen in at the Culebra
cut for the third time, and it won’t be fit
for the passage of ironclads for some months.
The Culebra cut isn’t a very lofty affair, but
the ground is rotten. As much earth as
there is between Sydney and Parramatta
started to break away and sag into the canal
when the cut was made. And until all
Strathfield and Bunvood and Granville and
Auburn and Parramatta have gradually
fallen into the canal and been dredged out
again, the great waterway will be a pre-
carious proposition for Uncle Samuel’s war-
ships.

tribute to the “remarkable vigor and re-
source” of the Australian Red Cross, “which
has converted an hotel into a hospital at
Wimereux.” Wimereux is one of the
numerous little French seaside resorts that
are dotted along the northern coast of
France. It is about three miles out of
Boulogne; but whereas Boulogne is a curi-
ous admixture of modern cockney English
and medkeval French, Wimereux is an ex-
clusively French resort. There are no shops,
and the place has but a single hotel —the
one now occupied by Australia. In the
winter time it and all the villas are shut up.
In the summer such of the latter as are to
be rented bring £4O or so for the months of
July and August. The hotel, a large one,
looks out over the Channel, and from its
windows on very clear days one can see the
cliffs of Britain. It is airy and comfort-
able, and admirably adapted to its present
use; and should the Red Cross extend its
operations, the same may be said of the
neighboring villas.
HER IDEAL.
H E: " But I tell you I’m quite mad about
you. Why won’t you believe me?”
S HE: “Because you don't puff and heave your
chest like the men in the moving pictures.”
The programme of murders for the pre-
sent Australian year opened with star turns
by a Turk and a Hindu at Broken Hill, and
a French-Canadian at Toolern Vale (Vic.).
The Turk induced the Hindu to join him in
an attack upon a train-load of civilians,
which was about as truly warlike as the
German naval bombardment of Scarborough.
As for the unfortunate French-Canadian,
who was Spanish on one side, he killed his
poor girl because she had dissuaded him from
going to fight for France. Then he killed
himself in order to prove his valor to his
own complete satisfaction. Patriotism has
some queer exponents.
“C. Park”: Why all this talk about the
need for more recruits? We all know
that the Germans are as good as settled.
The Austrian army has been smashed once a
week, or oftener, since the beginning of
October. It has been routed by the Rus-
sians and driven out of Servia. Racial
HOLIDAY DEFERRED.
S HE: “ Everybody tells me I’m looking pale.
What do you think I ought to do to get
my natural color back?”
B RUTE: “Put less powder on.”
disaffection is rife in the ranks ; and about
the only sentiment common to the whole of
the Dual monarchy is loathing of the Prus-
sians. German retreats have become routs
both in France and Russia. The troops
which are defending the Belgian positions
are mostly boys and elderly men. Their
morale is broken and their officers have to
urge them into action with revolvers. The
detested officers do this from behind, for
several reasons —one of which is to escape
being shot in the back. The Germans are
also starving and short of war material, and
their clothes are ruined. The Zeppelins are
proven failures, and the British and French
airmen have established a moral domination
over the enemy. The Allies have never
evacuated a position except for strategical
reasons. The battleships that have been
sunk were obsolete and due for the scrap-
heap, anyhow. Apart from the loss
of brave men —inseparable, after all, from
warfare—-it is questionable whether the
Germans didn’t do the Empire a good turn
by relieving it of these encumbrances. All
these news-items have been handed to us,
with the imprimatur of the Censor. If they
are true, why worry? Our young men may
stick to work, diversified by surfing and
cricket, as before ; our factories and small-
arms’ shops drift along in a fiscally under-
protected state as in the past; and all be
as though Armageddon had not arrived. If,
on the other hand, things are different, and
if it is made clear that the Germans are not
“at the end of their tether,” or even “securely
held both in France and Russia,” then the
laisses-faire attitude of Australia is going to
change. At present, however, the Censor,
aided and abetted by the press, is telling the
people to go on sleeping. In fact, he is
insuring that they shall not awake by giving
them daily doses of chloroform. Suppose
they go on sleeping and something terrible
happens to us in consequence, whom shall
we crucify?

“Moutue”: Stung by the fact that one
telegram, two letters, one parcel and one
newspaper addressed and sent to me before
Christmas have not yet been delivered, I
rise to suggest that January 21 be set apart
as a day of prayer and supplication for the
Commonwealth postal service. Bet every
citizen on that date address to the P.M.G. a
memorial setting forth in plain and vivid
Australian language his own personal griev-
ance against the Post Office. United action
is required to make the authorities who con-
trol this alleged public convenience under-
stand that it is the most slipshod, lame, one-
eyed and uncombed affair that any com-
munity ever endured outside the Ottoman
Empire. Personally, lam in favor of having
all postal officials declared Germans and
treated as game. I undertake to bag eight
of the most pernicious the day the close
season ends.
When William Ebenezer Reed left Denili-
quin (N.S.W.) in 1898 on a visit to Mel-
bourne, after a bad accident, he was of no
consequence at all. Now he is more or less
famous. It happened this way. Instead of
returning to Deniliquin he decided to go to
Queensland and look for work. When he
had been there for a couple of years he got
word that his wife had died, so he bought
the usual black tie and wept. Also his wife
heard that he had died; and knowing the
Queensland climate’s habit of killing off the
young, she didn’t doubt it. She wept too —
and married someone else. Until last
August, William Ebenezer continued dead.
Then he wandered into Deniliquin to collect
his rent, and found out that he had died
(officially) about 14 years ago. Still in-
considerate, he refused to remain buried, and
moved the Probate Court to dig him up
again. The Probate Court, recognising the
stuffiness of being buried while you are alive,
hadn’t the heart to refuse. Now his “widow”
is wondering what her position is. Enoch
Arden is the only precedent. When Enoch
came home and found his wife remarried he
went away and died. But Ebenezer’s dislike
of death amounts almost to a passion; so
there seems no hope for the lady that way.
Perhaps they might toss for her.
“M. Safrand”: An Anglican parson had
this significant thing to say last week: —
Above all I ask your prayers on behalf of the
men and the families who have given their lives for
us. Let us drop to-day all ugly disputation about
the permissibility, or the legality of prayers for the
departed. Even Martin Luther —Protestant as he
was —entirely approved of prayers for the fallen.
The Archbishop says that we may remember them
before God. All right, if you can remember them
without praying for them, do. I can’t.
The Protestant cleric who yields a little to
the requirements of human nature does as
much for his faith as the Tory politician who
swallows a little Socialism from time to
time, does for Conservatism. It is the ex-
tremists who drive the flock from the fold,
whether in religion, politics or other matters.
The arrival of a great national tragedy is
always the signal for an outbreak of pray-
ing for the dead. The tendency is almost as
old as human nature, certainly as old as
civilisation. Religion is useless to most
people if it fails to supply comfort, and the
greatest comfort a bereaved person can get
is the idea that he is doing something to help
the departed. There is going to be a record
number of deaths during the coming year—
not natural deaths of old people and invalids,
but the tragic endings of people who are
young and strong—and the Churches which
will do the business are those which allow,
tactfully, for the exceptional conditions.
“Rimu” : What a primitive business mod-
ern war is! British soldiers make bombs of
jam-tins; Indian troops rush trenches with
the knife; the Russian bayonet charge seems
to be more effective than the big Prussian
guns. Germany is supposed to have a naval
secret that will break things when once the
swine ships start out on their long-promised
work of destruction ; France has something
awful to Jet loose on the invader if he actu-
ally to Paris; England has still the
recipe or prescription, or whatever it is, of
Admiral Dundonald, which will make the foe
turn up like a caterpillar in brine. I begin
to wonder if the secret in each case is not a
plain meat axe, which is the last word in
warfare if you can get near enough to use it.

A MATTER OF SYMPATHY.
Benevolent Gent: “ Well, Pietro, and how is your wife keeping?”
PIETRO : “Ah, Meeister, she not feela the verra well. You'a see, sir-a, the poor leett
monk he catcha the verra bad cold and then ’e die, and the missus she fretta
the verra much.”
CHINESE FLIRTATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Underneath her shady hat
See her smooth, young Chinese face.
He’s a Mongol, young and fat,
With the slant eye of his race.
Son and maid of Old Cathay
Dining in the English way.
They are lovers—yellow, shy—
And they can’t conceal the fact;
Each bright, narrow-slitted eye,
Each self-conscious speech or act
Tells the spies around them: “These
Are affianced young Chinese!”
But if they have thrown away
Ancient customs, dress and rites,
Still they take from Old Cathay
Words to mask their young delights ;
Gaily they make love among
Strangers in their quaint old tongue !
Pity now the English swain—•
Shy, uncomfortable, hot —
He who mutters in his pain:
“Er —I say!” and “Yew know wot!”
Love is blind, but it knows well
Long-eared spies will watch and tell.
Merrily they love and laugh
While the Europeans stare,
And the smiling aproned staff
Hurry here and hurry there.
If at love you’d take your ease,
Flirt in musical Chinese!
N.S.W.

THE ALTERNATIVE.
British Liberal Ministers are so gravely impressed with the necessity for obtaining more men, and obtaining them speedily, that Mr. Macnamara, Parliamentary Secretary to the
Admiralty, has been put up to warn the shirkers that compulsion will soon have to be applied unless the rate of recruiting improves. — ARGUS.
POLICE CONSTABLE BULL: “Move on, young fellows, if you’re going to walk to camp.”
YOUNG FELLOW: “Walk, be blowed! We’re going to be driven there. We’ll wait until the coach goes.”

The Australian War Contingent was stopped in Egypt with a view to meeting the exploded Turkish invasion. The men are training, and circumferential
Commissioner George Reid has visited the country and spoken Avoids of enthusiasm and encouragement.

ITEMS
ATTORHEY-GENERAL
HOMBURG, S.A.
Admiral Charles Cross, on the retired list,
lied lately in England. His widow was a
daughter of John Nepean Mclntosh, an old-
time solicitor of Bathurst (N.S.W.). Two
sons are left, one in the Navy, the other in
the Army, and both on active service.
At the very “toney” St. Peter’s Anglican
Church in East Melbourne, the equally
“toney” Canon Hughes has the help of a
Chinese curate, the Rev. James Cheong,
M.A., son of Cheok Ilong Cheong, for many
years Anglican missionary in Lilly Bnurke-
street. Educated first at Scotch College, the
Rev. James went to Oxford for 12 months,
and on returning was placed by the Arch-
bishop in charge of the mission to the
Chinese. Here his liigh-church proclivities
caused trouble, and after a while Hughes
gave him sanctuary at St. Peters. One of
his brothers is on the Chinese Times, which
ceased publication for a while after the War
broke out. Cheok Hong Cheong had such a
passion for scriptural names that he had a
large family of boys simply to be able to call
them, James, Joshua, Caleb, Nathaniel and
Benjamin. In his old age he took up an
orchard at Croydon, and is recognised among
auctioneers as one of the shrewdest real-
estate valuers in the city.
FREDERICK CHAPPLE, B.A. , B. Se ,
just-retired Headmaster of Prince Alfred College,
Adelaide.
Another knight-mayor—D. V. Hennessy,
of Melbourne.
Apart from war the grim Kitchener has
one hobby; he is happy to get into an old
Pair of pants and potter about among
violets and daisies at Broome Park, his
place near Canterbury. When he was in
India his home at Simla was Wildflower
Hall.
Died at Melbourne, aged 87, Thomas
Cooker, a naval veteran with a record.
Away back in the early ’4o’s he clawed
through the China war. That trouble over,
he served on board the Agamemnon, the
flagship of the British fleet co-operating with
the Franco-British army in the Crimean
blunder. Next he became chief petty-officer
of the Victorian naval forces, and helped
Captain Fuller to organise the Naval Bri-
gade. Upon retirement many" years ago he
was elected president of the Naval Veterans’
Association, and has been the Admiral of
that squadron ever since.
Recent promotions in Maoriland’s police
service include chief-detective Broberg, of
Wellington, who has been transferred to
Dunedin as sub-inspector. lie came into
the limelight by his sensational capture of
the murderer Ellis after a relentless pur-
suit of him in “the wild country” of the
south-east corner of the North Island about
eight years ago. It was one of the most
tireless “hunts” in M.L. police history, and
the arrest in a lonely bush hut, where Ellis
crouched, armed and cornered, was more
like Yankee fiction than reality. Broberg
is one of two native-born constables to
reach commissioned rank in M.L.’s service.
The other is Mcllveney, promoted at the
same time.
Trefle, the just-dead Lands Minister of
N. S. Wales, was the son of the first settler
in the Temora portion of the Riverina
wheat country. His father was a roving
French-Canadian, who had thought to settle
in the Warrnambool district, but couldn’t
rest till lie had moved into new territory.
The family had hardly fixed themselves up
comfortably when the Temora gold rush
broke out, and John Louis, then a young-
ster, had the time of his life selling kan-
garoo tails at five shillings a time. From
farming the youngster passed on to
journalism, and lie and a partner (J. 11.
Bradley) owned the Temora Independent.
Amazing; the flair some folks have for self-
advertisement. A youngster was killed in
action in S’Africa last week. The fact was
advertised, together with the irrelevant in-
formation that he was the nephew of Mrs.
lirowne-Noandso. Nothing said about who
his father, mother, brothers or sisters were;
merely a notification regarding a busy politi-
cal aunt.
“U.S.Y.P.” concerning an unfortunate old
lady who is probably dead :
Melbourne papers recently published a yarn con-
cerning the Empress Charlotte, widow of that hard-
luck monarch, Maximilian of Mexico. According to
the press story, the Germans when about to seize a
large “chateau” in Belgium, were informed that
the Empress of Mexico resided there, and so they
passed on. Maximilian was a brother of that other
hard-luck Hapsburg, Francis Joseph of Austria (who
is probably dead also) ; and when, away back in
1867, the futile Napoleon IJI. decided to withdraw
from Mexico his French troops, who were Maxi-
milian’s only hope against a bitter Republican oppo-
sition, it was the Empress Charlotte who tried to
put things straight. Charlotte was a daughter of
Leopold 1., of Belgium, and an aunt of the present
king, and she sailed for Europe immediately to see
Napoleon 111. Getting no satisfaction she started
off to see the Pope, but on her way became insane
and had to be removed from the Vatican by force.
Maximilian was shot by the Mexicans the same year.
If the newspaper story about the chateau is correct,
the old lady is still alive and apparently confined
under the protection of Albert of Belgium. The
story of the chateau being spared by the Germans
works in all right, since Charlotte is a sister-in-law
of Francis Joseph of Austria, whose main misfortune
(if he is not dead) is that William the Hog is his
ally. Mac Hugh, in his book on “Modern Mexico,”
rather spoils the story, though, by reporting that
Charlotte “died in a mad-house some years ago.”
“Jermyn Street” writes about Sir Edward
Carson, K.O.: —•
The best picture of him was drawn by Hugh E.
Wright in the revue “Kill That Fly.” Wright
entered to a table at which three peaceful persons
were seated, and hitting it with a blackthorn stick
that made it jump he roared “Come on ! I’m willing
to fight, anybody about anything.” He is not an
anti-Home-ltuler at all by rights, except in so far
as he is instinctively anti-everything, and he has
no trace of natural community with the dull in-
tolerants of the North. He has all the waywardness
of brilliant Irishmen. In a jury action which was
being bitterly fought Carson was the centre of the
tornado. In the middle of the turmoil his eye fell
on a picture postcard of “some ruined chapel on the
margin of an Irish lake.” Suddenly he forgot all
about the battle, picked up the card, and said very
audibly but irrelevantly: “Lismore Castle. It makes
me feel homesick.” In cross-examination he can be
remorselessly cruel. In the “Osborne Cadet Case,”
for instance, Carson: “Do you drink?” Witness:
“That’s my business.” Carson: “Have you any
other?” He is absolutely nothing of a lawyer, but
he has the great quality of grasping the most
elusive point the instant it is explained to him.
In the days when he was at the Irish Bar he was
rivalled by Tim Healy, K.C., who has since taken
silk in London. A section of Dublin opinion pre-
ferred Healy to Carson. But with London juries
Tim can’t cut the same ice as with Irish; he is far
too picturesque and allegorical. With them Carson’s
great rival was Rufus Isaacs, lately made Lord Chief
Justice.
“A.H.C.” takes off his hat:—
Batchelor, Roberts, Fraser, McGregor, Arthur—
and now Jolley! Full many a time and oft this
writer has sat at the feet of the plump, explosive,
little Maryborough barrister. A lovable fellow alto-
gether was old Jolley, a free, open-handed Celt, whom
many a poor devil has had to thank for a defence
gratis. But, with all his devil-may-care qualities,
he was strangely sensitive to any criticism of his
personal appearance.
An unguarded remark
to the effect that he
was looking off-color
was enough, in recent
times, when he and
health were not on
good terms, to send
him to bed for two
or three days. But
illness no more robbed
him of his sparkling
wit and caustic criti-
cism of hypocrisy and
bombast than it did
Victor Daley eight
years ago. He joked
while he gasped. The
end came on New
Year’s Day, a renewal
of apoplexy bouts fin-
ishing off one of the
brightest spirits Vic-
toria ever sent into
politics. In past days
•lolley wrote much.
Bulletin readers knew
him chiefly as “Ooloo”
—mostly verse with
more sparkle in it than
the average University
man can manage.
MR. DABAZA,
Consul-General for
Russia , Melbourne.
(Observe his beauti-
ful face furniture.)
Percy Holden Illingworth, Chief Whip
for the British Government, is dead, aged
(inly 45. A couple of years ago, when Brit-
ish politics were seething over the Marconi
scandals, Illingworth drew heavy fire through
taking on the role of amiable explainer. Most
of his efforts were devoted to saving Lord
Murray of Elibank, who had canuily got from
under, and had taken a remunerative job in
the oil enterprises of Weetman Pearson, Lady
Denman’s father. The job had taken him to
Bogota, in South America, and there, while
the storm raged, Murray rested and allowed
the hard knocks to fall on Illingworth.
Finally everybody lost all interest in the
Marconi riot and with it in Illingworth, who
came out of it with no more than an under-
mined constitution.
Tired of waiting for briefs, both John
Madden, Chief Jus-
tice of Victoria, and
Cullen, C.J. of N. S.
Wales, sought small
University billets—
and didn’t get them.
Cullen’s shot was for
a lectureship at
Adelaide; Madden
wanted to be War-
den of the Senate
in Melbourne. The
practice in the Mel-
bourne County Court
in . the ’6o’s was
divided between Bin-
don (afterwards
Judge) and Newton,
father of the Clerk
of the Parliaments.
On these two the
“lower branch” re-
lied, as having the
ear of the Court.
After a while Frank
Quinlan and John
Madden pushed in.
and when Cope be-
came Judge, vice
Polilman, there was
an open field. New-
ton’s practice fell
off when he entered
politics, on the then
unpopular side. On
the other hand poli-
tics gave Madden a
leg-up, and undoubt-
edly helped him to
get his place on the
bench.
MAXWELL, of the
Victorian Bar.
Fitzpatrick, the champion interjector of
N. S. Wales, has joined the deathless army
of newspaper correspondents who are indig-
nant because other people don't go to the
war. In a long letter full of sword-clahk
and spur-jingle he has called upon all men at
street corners to arise and follow him into
the thick of the fighting—or, rather, to get
into the thick, and he will see them later.
Barrister Henry Newbolt’s patriotic
verses deserved something better than the
horror of knighthood, which “Banjo” Kip-
ling managed to dodge even at the time of
the S’African business when a Conservative
Government was in office. But, then, Kip-
ling, in spite of his 10,000 faults, is in-
finitely the greater man. Certainly Newbolt
can write a good, ringing line, and always
manages to keep his patriotism dignified;
though when you read him you feel sure
that he regards an English public-school
product as the only noble work of God. As
blood bards the difference between the two
men was well enough put by somebody or
other who remarked: “To Newbolt battle
is a sacrament; to Kipling it is a bean
feast.”
By “Solomon Malaprop” :
People begin to wonder how the Creation got along
without Niels Nielsen, the disgruntled colleague fcr
whom the N.S.W. Government so long provided £4
a day in order that he might inspect flying bears, or
something of the sort, in the; U.S. Nielsen is now
mentioned as a possible agent to represent Australia
at the Panama Exhibition (the Panama Canal having-
just been blocked by its third land-slide seems a
pretty good exhibition in itself) in place of Alfred
Deakin. The billet is one which calls for a man who
will advertise Australia, and make friends, and create
a general impression that all Australians are gentle-
men. There is so little real business to be made out
of it that it is hardly worth while to send a strenu-
ous bagman. If someone must go he should be a
courteous and accomplished ambassador. Deakin is
eloquent, patriotic, sober (some politicians are not),
learned (some' politicians lack even the aspi-
rate), and affable (he would have made a much
bigger success in politics if he hadn’t been so
affable). He was never seen running after a girl at a
late hour or any other hour. He- has no enemies (he
would have done better in politics if he had made
enemies). He is capable of associating with kings
without falling over his own feet or the kings’
feet. He is a man of handsome presence. When lie
has received an allowance to go on some public
mission he has handed back the surplus moneys on
his return as a matter of course. No one ever ran
him in. No one ever bailed him out. No one ever
dreamed of making him a co-respondent. A frantic
American who went to Victoria on an irrigation
scheme in the Gillies-Deakin days once stated in
court that he and his friends went to see the Chief
Secretary to ask him how much he would take, but
after looking at the Chief Secretary they came away
without “approaching” him. One of them said pri-
vately that Deakin was too stupid to understand a
fine, dishonest proposition if it was put before him.
Another, probably' wiser, said privately that he
thought the Affable One would have done murder if
the thing had been even hinted at. If Australia must
have a dignified representative at the Panama Exhibi-
tion it is a pity that some disagreement between
Deakin and the Fisher Government should have made
Alfred retire from the position. Nielsen would be
a noisy calamity by comparison.
THE PLUMBER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At Bow police court William Billings, plumber, was
lined 40s. and costs for kissing a maid-servant in a
house in which he was employed. —London daily.
The plumber man is light of heart,
Although his trade is leaden ;
From standpipes he can stand apart,
Nor let the dead-lights deaden.
His station may be on the roof,
His sentiments are human.
While making skylights weatherproof
He looks on lovely woman.
That is, if lovely woman hap
To linger on the landing,
Unconscious that a plumber chap
Suspects her under-standing.
Or, better, when some strange defect
Afflicts the cellar grating
That needs a maiden to defect,
And aid him in locating.
Or is he called on to repair
Such slight domestic failings
As lack of light upon the stair,
Or solder on the railings;
In all, his modesty is such
His confidence will dwindle,
Unless he has a woman’s touch
To make the whole thing kindle.
What wonder when the maid of Bow
Called William to assist her
To make the washing water flow,
He could not, till he kissed her?
Could we expect a plumber chap,
In such a case, to quash her
With cold disdain, and tend the tap,
And quite neglect the washer?
A plumber has a heart of gold,
And, when he’s on his mettle,
He’d: gladly eat his mutton cold
To mend the kitchen kettle.
And why should plumber not be led
By light and lovely woman?
He turns his nut—and, if his head,
Why not to her —’tis human?
So, magistrates, be human, too,
To William’s coos and billings ;
Or how can he expand his screw
To fines of forty shillings?

All the figures are moving the right way.
But there are things with which the figures
don't deal. For instance, comparing the
expenses and the income, it is plain that the
business is now costing substantially less than
it used to; but only an actuary’s report could
tell you whether the business was nastier
as well as cheaper. Curiously enough, though
the National Mutual has a hardshell Board,
composed of men like Irvine, Walter Mad-
den and old Dr. MacFarland, it has less re-
spect for established rule and precedent than
any other big insurance concern in Aus-
tralia. Thus, following what appears to be
the pretty general rule in England, at least
one Australian insurance ofiice is collect-
ing an extra premium from certain
policy-holders who go to the war,
whereas the National Mutual told the
same inquirers to go, and good luck
to them! The fact, of course, is that, with
hardly an exception apart from officers,
the men who go to the war are insured for
very small amounts —couple of hundreds
mostly—so that the call on the society isn’t
likely to be large. Further, these fellows are
not risking their lives on their own account,
so much as on account of the men with the
big policies who stay at home. Therefore it
isn’t an unfair thing to ask the latter to pay
out a bit. In fact, if anybody ought to be
charged an extra premium while the war
lasts, it isn’t the man who risks the bullets ;
it is the man who stays at home and has his
securities fought for. Doubtless recognis-
ing all this, the National Mutual decided to
take the risk. The society will find it was
a good stroke of business, if it cares to look
at the matter in that sordid way.
But that is more or less wandering from
the subject. What was being said was that
the National Mutual is game to take its own
(ourse. It seems to have concluded long ago
that medical examinations don’t give an
office much protection, while they are cer-
tainly shied at by thousands of people who,
never having had to call in a doctor, dread a
doctor’s overhaul. The first result is this
remarkable shrinkage in medical exes.:—
Proportion of Medical Exes, to New Premiums.

Even the 10.9 p.c. with which the little com-
parison starts is much lower than the aver-
age of leading life offices. The cutting-out
of the doctor means a direct saving. But
there is probably some indirect saving also
through the greater ease with which good
but shy “lives” are roped in. Anyway, with
the one reduction has come another: —

The really important point, though, is the
extent and cost of new business; for an
office might reduce its aggregate exes, tre-
mendously by the simple process of sacking
all canvassers and paying no commission.
There is no way of telling to a penny what
new business costs. But you can at least
get fairly good data for a comparison.
Assuming that old (renewal) business cost
7 p.c. and annuity business cost 3 p.c., then
the balance would be what new business con-
sumed in exes. Then

The figures are naturally not quite as good
for the past year; for though there were only
a couple of war months in the financial
year, there was a whole 12 months of
drought and gloom in those country districts
in which the National Mutual has its strong-
hold. Considering that it didn’t pour out
money in an attempt to attain the unattain-
able, it did very well in getting 12,500
policies as against 13,009 in the preceding
year.
But war and drought and harder times are
not all loss to a co. with nearly nine millions
to invest; and the interest earnings have
climbed up another few points:—
Interest Earned on Average Funds.
1905 .. £4 13 7 p.c. I 1910 .. £4 13 3 p.c.

That’s a rattling good rate; but it is only
achieved by putting a large proportion of the
assets in securities which are only silver-
edged. The next list shows the disposition
of the money :

•Just on 00 p.c. in mortgages, another 10
p.c. in loans on policies and less than 7 p.c.
m public securities! With its money em-
ployed in that way the society couldn’t very
well avoid high interest-earnings. The worst
trouble is that Australian property values
are liable to bad slumps. After the smash
of the big Melbourne boom the co. had one-
tenth in value of its mortgages thrown on
its hands. Still a life insurance office has
this advantage: it very rarely has to rush
the assets on to the market. It can afford to
nurse the sick security and wait, though if
it can’t; show a decent interest return while
it is waiting, it is liable to get a knock from
which recovery is terribly difficult. On that
point ask the old M.L.A. and Widows’ Fund
or the Colonial Mutual. Many a man has
become a millionaire through dealing in
mortgages and real estate; and there is no
reason why an insurance office shouldn’t
make money the same way; yet it can be
said pretty positively that of the Australian
life offices which have got into the backwash,
two-thirds have arrived there, directly or in-
directly, through mortgage and prooertv
investments. Add to that risk the fact that
large investment in mortgages means higher
exes, than if the funds were mostly in public
securities, and there is a substantial set-off
against the National Mutual’s uncommonly
good interest earnings.
Twelve months ago it was suggested here
that, in making his then-forthcoming tri-
ennial report, the actuary should go into the
effect of dispensing with medical examina-
tion on the mortality experience. lie did so,
and says: “The deaths involved claims [in
three years] amounting to £661,986; this
amount is only 60 p.c. of the expected....
The practice which was adopted 12 years
ago, and has now had a fair trial,
of accepting without medical examina-
tion proposals for assurance of small
amounts and for limited terms has
been completely successful. The ratio of the
actual to the expected claims under proposals
so accepted lias throughout not exceeded the
ratio of the total business.” The results of
the vigorous work of the past few years are
now showing in bonuses; and the figures, if
they don’t yet reach those of the A.M.P.,
don't blush beside them. Take the case of a
man who at 30 took a. whole-life policy.
Suppose he had been insured 20 years, his
reversionary bonus in the A.M.P. for last
year would have been £3 per £lOO. worth
£1 6s. 7d. cash value. In the National
Mutual he would get £7 for three years =
£2 6s. Sd. per annum per £lOO. worth 19s. 2d.
cash. In the A.M.P. the premium is
£2 Bs. 2d In the National Mutual £2 6s. Sd.;
and in that there is a partial set-off against
the slightly higher bonuses still paid by the
senior office.
The Australian Amicable Assurance
Association (Sydney).—This concern may
be given another 12 months in which to
show whether it should be permitted to live
or be wiped right out. Its beginnings have
been shocking; and the accounts now pub-
lished are simply an evidence that the Com-
panies Act in N. S. Wales is a snare. It is
disgraceful that people should be permitted
to canvass for insurance business and tell
no more about their affairs than this co.
does. And a great deal of what it does tell
is misleading. Here you have, for instance,
two items on the Assets side of the balance-
sheet. One says: “Cash on hand, in bank
and on deposit, office furniture, goodwill, un-
called capital, outstanding premiums, vehicles
and motor-car. agents’ balances, sundry
debtors, overdue premiums, and proportion
of preliminary expenses, £21.155” ; the other:
“Establishment expenses to date. £12,331.”
It is necessary to explain what has become
of the subscribed capital (£32.967) and the
sundry creditors and premiums in suspense
(£519) ; and that is how it is done. But,
though £32,967 is technically subscribed, it
is fairly certain that not more than about
one-half of that amount has been actually
paid-up, and of that amount, again. £5OOO
was not put up in money, but was a prepos-
terous part-payment made to the promoters,
who had nothing tangible to hand over in
return for it. As nearly as can be made out the
cash actually put up lias been £13,985. or
less ; and as the “establishment expenses” to
date admittedly amount to £12,381, the cash
and tangible assets left amount, on this
reckoning, to £1654 or less. And, of course,
that isn’t net, because it is claimed that “the
total volume of new business completed and
paid for exceeded a quarter of a million”;
and a great part of the premiums received
during the year, amounting altogether to
£4067. have not yet been earned. That is to
say, the fire and accident risks are current
till various periods of the present year, and
claims may arise—and may reasonably be ex-
pected to arise—till the policy period ex-
pires ; while as to life risks, a reserve ought
to be accumulated towards paying the policy
on maturity.
On this subject of reserves which ought to
be accumulated, the directors say: “The con-
tingent liabilities.... are necessarily omitted
from the balance-sheet, pending actuarial
valuation, which will be made at the end of
the association’s fifth year. An earlier valu-
ation would be of little advantage and would
subject the association to an outlay that
would not be warranted.” Tiie Bulletin
says once more that it doesn’t expect an in-
surance office to show good figures during its
first two or three years. But this paper does
expect an office to be able to show conclu-
sively that it has provided for all its policy
and other liabilities; and it is extremely
doubtful whether this co. can do it. On the
published accounts and such other informa-
tion as is available, the question can’t be
answered without some qualification. Yet it
is enormously important that there should
be no qualification about it in regard to an
insurance office. Here again the law is a dis -
grace. An insurance co. may go on for five
years without producing a balance-sheet that
is of any value whatever; for a balance-sheet
which takes no heed of accumulating and
contingent liabilities is a delusion.
Whether this co. can get out of the bog
in which its promoters landed it the current
year will pretty well show. Some of the men
connected with it are better than the results
so far achieved, and they may pull it
through. Pending positive proof, nobody
should this year have anything to do with
it except after careful inquiry. If the office
does pull through, it may have a prosperous
future, because it has got hold of one or two
ideas that are undoubtedly attractive.

The society started an Accident branch eight
years ago; but at the end of seven years the
thimbleful of reserves were transferred to
the Industrial Branch, and some unnamed
society took over the business, and appar-
ently didn’t pay anything for it. Altogether
this seems an amazing transaction; and if
policy-holders didn’t ask for a little further
information about it at the annual meeting
they are as nice and agreeable a lot as any
management could possibly wish for.
Both remaining branches show the usual
vigorous growth in revenue figures. Not quite
as big a growth as usual of late; still one
that would have made the office gasp through
its cobwebs 20 years ago. It is an amazing
fact that the income in the Ordinary de-
partment after its first 25 years was not so
great as the increase during the past five
years; and the recent hustle in the Indus-
trial section has been even more fruitful.
The figures would, however, be a lot more
satisfactory if they related to another sort
of business. Very nearly the whole of what
the Temperance and General does is of the
endowment variety; and though that is all
right for a man who is a bit gone in the
wind and can’t pull through a rigorous medi-
cal examination, or for one who is seeking
a sort of old-age pension, it is not the thing
for a young, sound, male person. He will
bo getting married presently, or he was
married lately, and what lie ought to do is
to get the most possible protection for the
missus with the money he can afford to pay
out. A young man of 22 who has £lO a
year that lie can spare can buy £5OO of
insurance if lie takes a whole-life policy ; but
if he takes a policy maturing even at 55 he
can buy only about £350 of insurance. For
the stodgy old chap whose wife has been
comfortably provided for already in case of
his death, an endowment policy is well
enough; what he may reasonably aim at
then is to give himself and his Joan a few
more comforts in old age, and for that there
is nothing better than endowment. But for
the healthy young man it ought to be the
whole-life every time; and because the T.
and G. pushes the endowment and hardly
anything else, this paper puts the society
down in only the third class of national
blessings. Look at its record, the figures

In the Industrial department the whole-life
insurances are for only one-fifth of the
amount of all the policies.
A man who took out a policy at 30 years
of age, and had held it for 20 years, would
last year have got from the T. and G. a
bonus of £1 10s. p.c., which would have a
cash value of 13s. Id. The premium would
be £2 9s. 6d. (In the T. and G., as well as
the A.M.P.. the premium is fixed on, the
age at next birthday. A very few offices,
the National Mutual among them, take the
age as that on the nearest birthday.) This
fairly respectable bonus no doubt owes a lot
to the society’s good interest earnings.
Bonuses come from three sources —better (1)
interest earnings. (2) expense rate, and (3)
mortality experience than the actuary figured
on when making up the tables. This shows
the interest earnings :
1907 ..£4 9 2p.c. I 1911 ..£4 10 f) p.c.

1910 .. 410 6 „ I 1914 . . 412 6 „
This is over 1 p.c. better than the assumed
rate, and is distinctly good considering that
just on to 40 p.c. of the assets are public
securities. Mortgages are just over 30 p.c.
On tlie other hand, freeholds stand for as
much as 13 p.c. of the assets, the result of
Sydney and other purchases during the last
two or three years. The society has had
pretty large dealings also in reversionary
and life interests. There is no visible fund
to meet such contingencies as loss on realisa-
tion of securities; and this is a weakness
which ought to be seen to.
Expenses have moved like this :

In both sections they are still heavy; but if
the proportion of new business is taken into
account the exes, charged to the Ordinary
section are probably the lowest in Australia.
Assuming the old (renewal) business cost 7
p.c., then the accounts claim that the new
business was done actually for under 69 p.c.
of the first-year premiums. It may be diffi-
cult to allocate with mathematical accuracy
the costs of the two branches; and this may
partly explain the low rate of the one and
the high rate of the other. Still, to what-
ever it is due, the low rate in the Ordi-
nary department must be a great factor in
creating bonuses. All that the society needs
to do now is to learn how to keep the policies
as well as it knows how to get them ; and in
the matter of bonuses it will then rank with
the best. At present, its surrenders, and
especially its lapses, take much of the fizz
out of the society’s ginger-beer.

This co. issued an undated prospectus—a
sloppy affair, in which it was reported that
a meeting had been held in Perth on the
15th inst.. though whether “inst.” was
January or December there is no way of tell-
ing. “Numbers of shares have already been
applied for,” it alleged, “and the stability of
tlie co. is assured” —which it wasn’t, by any
means. In fact, if there was much manage-
ment of the sort which led to the payment of
a 5 p.c. dividend at the end of the first year,
on the strength, presumably, of a profit
which wasn’t a profit at all, anything might
have happened. For, of course, the £1233
surplus shown for the first year was not
profit. The net premiums for that year were
£1789; and at least three-fifths of that
amount ought to have been put aside as
unearned premiums to cover unexpired risks.
Deduct, then, £1073 from the £1233, and
you have a profit for the year of £160; and
that probably overstates the case. Yet these
people paid a dividend!
Apart from that, The Bulletin has little
fault to find. The basis of the co. is quite
satisfactory. No free shares were issued
and nothing was paid for goodwill or pro-
motion, and the preliminary exes, were
strictly reasonable. The co. was needed;
there was no other with its head-office in the
western State. Further, the capital put up
was £40,000, which was, and is, enough to
give property-owners the fullest confidence.
An unsatisfactory feature, however, is that
no less than £38,255 of the total lias been
fixed in mortgages. Further, the co. is fol-
lowing the extremely doubtful policy of
launching out into business all over the Com-
monwealth. Two-thirds of the very many
failures among fife insurance cos. are due to
this impatience. Curiously, the promoters
in tlie prospectus referred to the great suc-
cess of a co. whose shares started at Is. 3d.,
and had risen to 505., and it was added that
this remarkably successful co. had stuck to
one State. They, therefore, had guidance,
yet disregarded it. A new concern like this,
going into Brisbane or Hobart or Melbourne,
and with no personal pull in those places,
lias such a fight that the expense rate is
likely to be 80 o.c. or 100 p.c. ; while, as only
second- and third-class business can be got,
as a rule, the losses are apt to be high.
Gradual expansion from a centre where the
interested people have a personal pull is the
right policy, and experience in the United
States teaches the same lesson.

The Meteor Igniter Co. holds a meeting
shortly in Sydney to decide on liquidation
or a call —the promoting and fully-paid end
naturally desiring the call and the continu-
ance of directors’ fees. But liquidation is
the l ight thing. Such eminent engineers as
Justices Cullen, Sly, Bring and Gordon have
practically said so. In the action Lamb v.
Johnson. Lamb claimed £2OO damages, £2OO
being the amount paid for shares in the co.
N.S.W. Supreme Court gave him a verdict
for the full amount. The promoter appealed
to the Full Court, and Lamb won the appeal
on the same grounds of misrepresentation.
Leave to appeal to the High Court was
refused. If, after all this, the Meteor Igniter
shareholders have any doubt as to the wis-
dom of litigation they are a very hopeful set.
And a wealthy lot as well. There are 100
contributing shares with £6O a share call-
able. and the money might as well be saved
for Holman’s next loan.

crooked paths. Far better to make straight paths

poor belting in the first place and tried to patch
them up and “make them do.’’ But a poor belt is
alwavs poor —and all ways. “Pioneer” leather belting

treatment received at the hands of the
A.M.P. Society by his son, a policy-holder,
and compares the A.M.I*. unfavorably with
other life-assurance societies. Some of his
remarks are beside the mark; others are
inaccurate. The policy in question, effected
under Special Military Risk when the
assured was leaving for the Boer '' ax,
became subject once more, in common with
all similar contracts made with life-assurance
cos. at the time, to the extra premium of £o
p.c. per annum owing to the life assured
again going on active military service. In
the interim it appears that lie had taken a
further policy in another co., under which,
like hundreds of others now at and going to
the Front, who hold policies with the A.M.I*.,
he is not called upon to pay any extra pre-
mium. It might here be mentioned that at
least one leading Australian life office will
not under any conditions assure anyone
leaving for the war. Finally the A.M.I*.
Society’s attitude in permitting the un-
married members of the staff to volunteei
for the Front with full pay and increments
during their absence —a permission that
has been freely availed of —is sufficiently
handsome to dispose of any charge of un-
patriotic conduct, and an example which
some other institutions might follow with
advantage to the Empire’s cause.

the £l5OO originally paid to a representative
of the Benz (German) Co., the Motor-bus

Treasurer Lyons, of Tasmania, the other
day introduced a bill - with the object of
suspending the payments (n the Public
Debt Sinking Fund for a year, so that the
money (some £50,000) might be used for
public works in war time. But the “Liberal”
politicians suspected a plot to hamstring
the Public Debt Sinking Fund altogether,
and rose as one affrighted Tory. Where-
upon Lyons pointed out that the Tas. Sink-
ing Fund is a fraud, anyhow, as Treasurers
always borrow the Fund whenever they are
hard up, giving the State’s’ lOU in exchange
for the State’s own borrowed money, and
paying the Fund’s Commissioners about the
same interest as the State is already paying
the foreign investor for the same money.
But the Opposition couldn’t see the joke.

British Broken Hill is banking its re-
sources, and did not pay the usual dividend
at the end of its past half-year. For the
half-year to the end of June (the accounts
for that period have only just dawdled out)
the net profit was £30.994, after allowing
for depreciation; but there are always ad-
justments to be made on final settlements
for metals sold. The co.’s financial position
on June 30 was very comfortable; liquid
assets amounted to £73.381. The co. has
no furnaces and depended wholly on German
buyers, who of course suspended their con-
tracts on the outbreak of the War, where-
upon the mine was shut down, and has since
done less than almost any other concern on
the Barrier.

Last year Hawkins Hill Reward
(N.S.W.) crushed 1238 tons stone for
12330 z. gold, worth £4797, which means that
the gold was worth £3 17s. Bd. per oz. and
the stone a trifle less than that per ton.
It is doubtful if this average can be sus-
tained. for at the 200 ft. level the north
drive has been taken 190 ft., and over that
length the reef is from Gin. to 24in. wide,
worth only from lOdwt. to 20dwt. per
ton. A recent crushing of 205 tons for
1740 z. shows a shade under 17dwt. per ton.
Shares are a gamble on the chance of a rich
make of stone being found when the levels
meet with a crosscourse. The early history
of Hill End was full of such incidents.
• * * *
You can generally tell how a mining co.
is doing by the way it loafs or doesn’t loaf
at Christmas. The Carpathia, Ardlethan,
grabbed the chance to do nothing during
the holidays, and didn’t make a start again
till January 13.
After a long run of blanks, Drumlish Hill,
Ardlethan, has found a nice rich shoot, from
which it will make two or three thousand
pounds. Numerous other claims at Ardle-
than would no doubt give working parties
similar results at long intervals.
Hitherto Westralia has got all its zinc
shavings for gold precipitation from Europe.
When the War started the supply was cut
off; but the U.S. supplied a couple of hun-
dred tons at a price which nearly took the
breath away. As the Broken Hill Prop,
was making zinc ingots, it was decided to
see whether the necessary rolling couldn’t
be done at Lithgow. Makeshift appliances
had of course to be used ; but the result was
so far successful that the Westralian cos.
have no further concern about their zinc-
shavings supply.
* *• * *
Marvel Loch (W.A.) is trusting to tri-
butors to pull it through; but royalties do
very little towards development, and calls
couldn’t be wholly avoided last half-year.
At present the co. evidently isn’t game to
come at the shareholders for money; there-
fore development work (so-called) has
stopped. In any case, of course, it isn't
development so much as it is desperate
prospecting for shoots that are long enough
to pay. » * *
It was local creditors and not London
debenture holders who seized Chaffers
(W.A.). The co. failed to make a do of
things because of short shoots and insuffi-
ciency of available ore for the mill. Towards
the finish it is alleged to have sent two tons
of rubbish for every ton of good ore in order
to keep the plant going. A lot of money is
needed to open up the mine well ahead of
the mill, and the question arises: Is it worth
it? The co. might have pulled through with
the cash it got out of the last reconstruction ;
but, as The Bulletin has remarked before,
it hadn’t hired the necessary brains.
* * * *
Snowball (chairman) and Were (large
shareholder) have been having a look at the
Edna May Central (W.A.). Snowball told
a Bulletin man on his return that the mine
is all right, but that development is like
the goat’s tail. He reckons that there will
be plenty of stone available for the mill by-
and-bye ; and then from 50 to 00 tons will
be put through daii, for a recovery of be-
tween 325. and 40s. per ton. The main shaft
is to be pushed down swiftly and a thorough
survey of the mine workings is now being
made by a competent man. That is about
all he had to say except that the cash in
hand amounts to £3OOO.
.v. * * *
Edna May Deeps (W.A.) starts sinking
right away. First 100 ft. is expected to be
soft, and preparations are being made for
installing a plant to,belt through the hard
rock which is expected to be met with at
that depth. The manager is steadfast in
his belief that the underlay of the Edna May
reef will find its way into the “Deeps” at
not more than 500 ft. from the surface.

G. C. King, 8.. M. & Co.’s manager, has
been telling the Kalgoorlie people that they
are among the luckiest on God’s earth.
Every live mine there is working full time,
and scarcely anybody has had his screw
docked. As regards mining. Klug says, after
having a good look round, that costs are
rising and grade is still falling; but for the
present the detrimental effect has to some
extent been balanced by the introduction, of
producer-gas power and other expense-saving
devices. Klug thinks well of the Rothsay
district, where he recently took up 450 acres
on behalf of the Yuanmi. Warriedar, in the
same locality, has also taken his fancy. Hap-
hazard samples from a network of reefs
give high dish prospects. On this field he
optioned 136 acres and pegged an additional
265 for some of the patrons of 8., M. &.Co. s
stable. Meekatharra, in King’s opinion,
looks the bes-t of any the established
mining centres in the West.

Victorian gold-mining was pinched in
1914 through the shutting down of two or
three big old mines like the Long Tunnel
and Lord Nelson, and the partial eclipse of
moderns like Central Blue, of Bendigo, and
Catlicart Central and Duke and Main Leads,
in the Ararat and Maryborough districts.
So the gold yield for the year was only
413,2880 z. fine, against 487,9840 z. in 1913.
Monthly averages went down with a thud
from August on; folk didn’t know how the
War would hit them, and their first economy
was to cut out calls, which meant the shut-
ting up of a number of poor producers.
Apart from that Victoria is suffering badly
from the exhaustion id’ known payable
leads. Since the Berry gutter in its deep
reaches ran into unpayable dirt, work has
been stopped there, and the Majorca lead,
the Duke Extended and the Duke and Main
Leads are the sole plodders in the Mary-
borough district. Malmsbury is at a stand-
still; Chiltern Valley is the one veteran
at Cliiltern and Ilutherglen ; and there isn't
a mine worth the name in Ballarat proper.
Cathcart Central remains to carry the Ara-
rat district until the New Langi and South
Langi prove the main gutter to be either a
sink for cash or the base on which a big
mining revival may be built. Unhappily
for deep-lead mining, most of the men high
up in the industry are as slippery as eels
and as greedy as sharks. So there, too, the
gentle public bars call-paying, for the pre-
sent, at any rate.
Edna May, Weston’s (W.A.), continues
its run of 3s. dividends. December crushing
and cyaniding gave £12,558. and as develop-
ment and plant took £4320 the profit was
£8238. Next fortnight will see the pumping
plant going. Then hey! for Nos. 4 and 5
levels and the granite country.
* * * *
From Jos. Miller, for many years manager
of Long Tunnel: The Melbourne papers say
the shareholders have had enough of the old
mine. I should think they had —in those
low levels, at any rate. Personally I tipped
a stoppage - after the Victorian elections.
In driving south at 3500 ft. level they got
the tail end of the never-was-payable north
shoot; and directly in line with that marked
on my assay plans at the levels above, show-
ing it pitching south at a very low angle.
In my opinion it will join the main shoot at
greater depth. Well, after all the boasting
and boosting and biting off more than they
could chew, they have failed to reach the
main shoot at a lower level —which, as you
may know, occurs on the fringe of the stone
at 900 ft. to 1000 ft. south of the main cross-
cut. All the gold won and £35,000 cash has
gone in the attempt. In my opinion they
were badly advised. I had gone into three
schemes to test the shoot at 100 ft. below
the bottom level, and I recommended —if the
old co. were prepared to spend more money
in that direction —the cutting of chamber
and other necessary ventilation workings,
and sinking a blind shaft, driving 100 ft.
N. and S., and equipping with electric hoist,
etc., at a cost of £15,000. I could not hold
out much hope of exposing profitable stoiie
unless an improvement took place, but it
might help to pay the cost, and the object
would be attained in less time and at
smaller cost than by way of the main shaft.
About the latest proposal—to crosscut from
main shaft under the 900 ft. level —I know
from plans and reports I have that nothing
was got at the 1100 ft. level south of the
Extended ground, and I am of opinion that
the original main shoot was too good to
allow us to expect another payable one in
the vicinity.

Oxide Creek, in the Mount Oxide (Q.)
neighborhood, has as good as settled its
Equity dispute with the Mount Gordon
Copper Co., which previously owned the
mine. Apparently the Oxide Creek Co. dis-
appears, which will be a very good thing,
considering that it has never been much
more than a bad smell. The Mount Gordon
Co. issues one half of its share capital to the
other co., and the other co. transfers to
Mount Gordon its leases, and pays the
Mount Gordon Co.’s costs and various
charges. # #
Brilliant Extended, Charters Towers,
crushed 1255 tons for £3403. This with
£824 from tailings gave a profit of £9OO.
The previous run gave £1291, so the six-
penny dividend (£6250) isn’t much of a
strain. On November 10 the cash in the
bank amounted to £15,484, and there was
£2531 payable to the co. for concentrates.
Yet the Towers feels so gloomy that the
local market has been trading at prices
barelv equal to the surplus assets. And be-
sides’ the more or less liquid assets the
Extended has a splendid crushing and haul-
ing plant: though of course those things
will not be worth much when the mine
peters out. People who sold at Is. must
have thought that event was within gun-
shot.

All these figures really represent the work

Pioneer (Tas.) handed out a 9d. dividend
(£6o46)as a Christmas box. The latest re-
turn is 221 tons of concentrates for 2?
weeks’ work, following 46 tons for 6 weeks.
The Pioneer produces concentrates at a
lower cost than any other sluicing or dredg-
ing proposition in Australia. _ The output de-
pends, however, upon the rainfall, which has
been scanty until the last few weeks. There
is an issue of 161,244 £1 shares, and on that
lot the co. can’t pay 10 p.c. unless it makes
over £3O per ton of blacky tin or concen-
trates. The market allows it to do a good
deal more than that at present.

Pernatty Copper, the S. Aus. spec, in
which Ardletlian Options has put some of
the money saved from the Ardletlian
wreck, is going to rely on the leaching of
copper from low-grade ore. This, although
theoretically very simple, has proved in
practice to be easily upset by snags. There
are several leaching plants in America,
where the treatment of low-grade (from 1
to 2 p.c.) silicious oxidised ore has been
undertaken; but generally speaking the pro-
cess is most suitable for tailings, as at
Moonta (S.A.). Once the copper is dis-
solved precipitation with scrap iron is easy.
To sum up, the process is the last resort
of the metallurgist when concentration is
too wasteful or direct smelting too expen-
sive.
Dr. Arthur Wade, petroleum field-expert
to the Commonwealth Government, goes
outside of his job in recommending that the
Papuan oil fields be thrown open to private
enterprise. Wade has been engaged _to re-
port on the possibility of a payable oil field,
and not on matters of Commonwealth policy
such as nationalisation. If Government
monopolies are any good at all, there was
never a better opening for their testing than
this new industry in a virgin field.
A co. with A. W. Palfreyman (of Tong-
kali ‘Compound) and one of the Howard
Smiths at its iiead has been formed in Mel-
bourne to search out and prospect tin and
other properties in Malaya. Eastman, a
good, practical man who did serviceable
work at Y Waterholes (N.S.W.), represents
the co. on the spot.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, January 11, 1915.
My Dear Arini, —
There seems to be solid fact for the half-
immorous suggestion that tourist trips to
France will presently be added to the list
of T. Cook and Son’s attractions. The Tom
Robinsons, of Queensland, had an Aus-
tralian girl, Miss Una Bell, under their
wing for a recent trip to French soil.
The girl was eager to have a look at
her brother, who was driving a motor ambu-
lance for the Australian Voluntary Hospital.
This passionate desire on the part of feminine
relatives to reach the fringe of battle and
see how it is getting on might be used to
form the nucleus of a booming war fund.
If the casual lady callers had to pay a poll
tax —say 10 per cent, of their incomes—the
war chest would soon begin to look like the
Fat Boy about whom Dickens discoursed.
As for Agent-General Robinson himself,
you may quite expect to hear when the
trouble is over that he has a French honor
as well as his English star to pin to his coat.
At the request of the British Government
lie is still putting his deep knowledge of
tinned and frozen bullock at the service of
the French War Office, for which he has
made some tremendous purchases.
An Australian who had a very mixed
time escaping from Norway to London, when
the War was an uproarious infant aged only
a few weeks, writes: “I am still wondering
whether anything, short of the enemy’s hoof
in Piccadilly, can move the ordinary citizen’s
British phlegm. When I had gathered my-
self together, after an exciting voyage in
mine-sewn seas, I took a stroll round the
city. Hoardings that advertised ‘Pleasant
pleasure trips to the Baltic’ were in their
old weather-beaten haunts. Also, I read in
one or two old-fashioned papers similar ad-
vertisements, detailing the bracing effect of
autumn jaunts to the same watery grave.”
Dr. Barrington, of Macquarie-street, and
Miss Barrington have hurried off to Maori-
land to have a look at Mount Cook and try
their luck with the trout at Temuka. The
South Canterbury river creeps in a peaceful,
nicely-behaved current between grassy banks.
Its green hair is neatly parted in the middle,
and its language is of the best and its table
manners excellent. The fisherman can, if
f°. disposed, pick posies of flowers on the
brink while lie waits for a rise. There is
good fly fishing on the Temuka and Win-
chester streams, and the scenery is quite up
to the rural setting of a J.C.W. production
at Her Majesty’s.
The fine old men who are urging the War
Office to accept them for the front include
Colonel Cameron, ivho went to South Africa
years ago in charge of a Tasmanian con-
tingent. The veteran, who is reported to
be in the pink of condition, was formerly in
the Cameron Highlanders. As a youngster
he was with “Bobs” on the historic tramp
to Kandahar. In politics soldier Cameron
was a fierce advocate of compulsory training.
He may inject some of his enthusiasm into
the deaf ears of the War uords he inter-
viewed during November.
A son of the late George Greene, of
i.andra, ln this State, is now gazetted as a
lieutenant in a Hussar regiment. If he has
the luck to come safely through the fighting
tomeroy Greene can back up his expensive
Hussar millinery with a fat bank account,
tor his late parent made a pot of money in
wheat-farming on the share system.
Another Encounter tar has marched to
the aitar with his best girl. The latest
benedict from that much-marrying crew is
Assistant-Paymaster James Hogarth. R.N.R.
Chaplain Allan Pain tied the knot. The
bride is a Melbourne girl—Miss Beatrix
Palmer Clark.
Comedian W. S. Percy recently • declined
promotion in his honorary billet as a Lon-
don special constable. Probably the Aus-
tralian fun-maker wasn’t looking for a rise
rrom nothing a week to double nothing paid
m advance or subsequently. Besides, after
hurling his five feet of grit between England
and trouble, the strenuous Percy had to find
time for his own line of business at the
music-halls.
rTi he L «bor Party is getting a bit
of the bad luck that has haunted the Fisher
tolks in Federal politics. The death of
Minister for Lands Trefle, in the prime of
life, snatches away the most lovable person-
a“by in the Cabinet. Appendicitis was the
thief that came to him in the night. For
months the late politician had been either
fighting or resolutely disregarding an insid-
ious illness which was heavily disguised as
’ufluenza, whereas it must have been the
more deeply-entrenched enemy. The hand-
some and much-liked Mrs. Trefle, who hails
from Erin, will have tons of sympathy to
help her in her bereavement.
There is to be an evening gathering in St.
Vincent’s Hospital Grounds on January 20.
The proceeds go towards the building fund
of the new Nurses’ Home. Sid Macdonald
is going to steer the musical programme.
Any lady who feels unable to get through
the entertainment without a game of bridge
will find card tables on the verandahs of
the Nightingale’s official nest.
The Hydro, at Medlow, where the moun-
tain air is the elixir for the prevention of old
age, has been stuffed with visitors during
the holidays. G.-G. Ferguson and Lady
Helen had a week-end there before dashing
back to Melbourne. The new knight, Dr.
Herbert Maitland, and Dr. Charles
MacLaurin also saw the New Year rise out
of the mountain mist. Beaumont Smith,
who runs the first-rate double bill at the
Palace Theatre, was under the same wide-
spread roof for a whiff of the elixir just
mentioned, and ..architect Theo Marks and
his pretty wife have been camping at the
Hydro in holiday mood. At the fancy-dress
hop on New Year’s Eve, Mrs. Bloomfield
was handed first prize as “Britannia” —
a symbolical lady who is quite the rage just
now. The second trophy was scored by
Mrs. Castling as a Bed Yankee squaw.
Mr. J. Chalmers, the director of Farmer’s,
who haunts local concerts in the season
(just now they’re put away in camphor),
is going to petrol up to Kosciusko with Mr.
J. Baton for the January goff carnival. Mr.
Baton is mixed up in electrical matters at
Macquarie Place, so he ought to be able to
bully a motor that misbehaves itself when
the road is long and steep and it is 25,000,000
miles to Tipperary.
Mr. Baton, who is president of the “Kossy”
golf show, was in Germany before the rude-
ness and unpunctuality and procrastination
started, and the Teuton began to eat with
his knife, and mop up his gravy with a piece
of bread, and stretch for the victuals in-
stead of having them passed to him. He
goffed on some of the links and says the
enemy takes the game, as he does most
sports, in a dull, plodding way. Most of
the green-keepers have a tartan accent, and
they “winked the other eye” when they dis-
cussed the German goffers. It seemed to
be a Caledonian tradition to make the Hog-
genheimer pay through his spectacles for an
afternoon’s pursuit of the little white balls.
Secretary Ross Gore, of the Rose Bay
Jinks, and J. M. Paxton are going to lend
their aid to the coming goff events at Kosci-
January 26 will be included in the
week’s stampede for prizes.
GhaGie Airey, a son of the late Colonel
11. P., of the once notable “A” Battery,
of Sydney, has left his South African farm
to enlist in Kitchener’s swelling army. It
was the deceased “A” Battery of which an
officer in the Royal Artillery said, in the
Boer War: “I thought our chaps could
drive till I saw those d Australians in
rough country.”
Politician Arthur is still tilting against
the now-defunct suggestion to bring Belgian
refugees here as settlers. The Government of
distressful little Belgium has firmly and
politely refused any Australian offers of the
kind. It has said that every Belgian man.
woman and child will be wanted when the
enemy has been chased back to his native
beer-gardens. Also, as a matter of cold his-
toiy. the inhabitants of Flanders are so pas-
sionately attached to their own little spot of
earth that emigration is almost an unknown
quantity in Albert’s kingdom.
Manly is going on a wild spree. The
uproar begins with brass bands and other
loud noises on Wednesday evening of this
week. Fireworks, choirs which are pledged
to sing in the open, a fancy-dress ball on the
Corso, and a Venetian carnival are amongst
the attractions which come to an end on
Saturday night. The Corso, you know, is
the wide main street of Manly. It never
had any pretensions to beauty, but its homely
face was once pitted with an unusually
dreadful brand of so-called statuary. How
the dancers will enjoy its loose metal under
the soles of their slippers is another story.
Still, the proceeds go to the Patriotic Fund,
and Manly has advantages for hanging itself
in a maze of colored lights.
Country tennis suffered from inclement
pools of waler on the Double Bay courts on
Saturday afternoon. A few enthusiasts,
cheered by a break in the clouds, straggled
down to the Manning-road lawns, but the
morning s rain had drowned the players’
chances at the nets. The postponed finish
is going on as I nail up this missive. The
petticoat teams from Bathurst are trying to
beat Lithgow, and the Orange girls are
whacking the ball with intent to defeat
Barraba’s best damsels.
London Daily Chronicle records the re-
vival of the ancient ditty. “God Bless the
Prince of Wales.” since Edward of Wales
took his turn in the trenches. His voutliful
'lghness has earned the name of being a
good foot slogger.” According to his regi-
mental mates he can do a 25-miles’ march
on a couple of sandwiches and an apple,
and turn up as fit as they make ’em at the
end of the tramp.
The Judges __and lawyers of Adelaide
easily found £550 for a motor-ambulance;
and now the hat is going round the Bench
and Bar in Sydney— not to provide three
ambulances, bless yon, but in the hope that
there will be enough in it when it comes
back to pay for one. As a coincidence, the
nominal leader of the S. Aus. Bar is Her-
mann Homburg, son of an ex-Judge who
was what his name would lead you to guess.
A stone or two have been thrown at the
son to make him go out; but he doesn’t see
why he should —and neither do his col-
leagues.
“The Girl on the Film,” now prancing
across the stage of Her Majesty’s, is a very
dull girl. She seems to consist of several
damsels who work for Max Daly (otherwise
C. 11. Workman), a cinema producer, actor
and manager, and they pant through stodgy
parts for the picture-show business. Napo-
leon, on a reluctant white horse, who is led
or dragged on to the centre of the stage, is,
of course, Max Daly. But Napoleon ought
to take five bars rest till the end of the War.
Even the things he did, or didn’t, at Moscow,
deserve a shroud till the Bear has had a
settling up with the enemy. “Carmen” is
also (like the white horse) dragged or cuffed
into one scene. Florence Vie gives good bur-
lesque of the part in which Cisneros hurled
her majestic figure into the spot light. But
Miss Carmen is a chestnut as a comic relief.
"The Girl on the Film” has one musical
item (worth mentioning)—“The Mill” song;
and Gertrude Glyn warbles it in dulcet
tones. The modesty of the writer of the
book is so extensive that he, she or it doesn’t
consider his, or her, or its, or their name of
sufficient consequence to appear in print.
Anyhow, I can’t find it.
A _ tangled impression is left by the
hurried reading of the following much-adver-
tised death notice:—
Henrietta, relict of John E. Meyer, of Plank-road
Hotel, Ballarat, Victoria, and youngest daughter of
the late Frederick Grundymann, Lieutenant in
Blucher’s world-renowned Cavalry Brigade, distin-
guished at Waterloo (from senile decav), ’aged 82
years, and leaving four surviving married daughters.
... .A colonist of 68 vears A Sword of Honor, in-
scribed “Waterloo, 1815,” is one of deceased’s cher-
ished family heirlooms.
Artist George Coates, who has tempo-
rarily folded away his easel to drill with
the United Artists’ corps, is also stamping
up and down London as a special constable.
It is a fashionable job. Napoleon 111. was
a special constable in London once. That
was_ before he and Ivinglake quarrelled over
a girl, wherefore Ivinglake grew wild and
wrote the History of the War in the Crimea
in eight volumes.
Included in a recent collection of art on
view in New Bond-street (London) for the
benefit of war funds, were some of Conder’s
paintings on silk, and some of his fan
designs. A few far-sighted Australians, who
bought the late Charles Conder’s work in
the long ago can congratulate themselves
on having caught their artist young, in his
comparatively green and salad days. He
was one of the originators of the subtle
delicacies of fan designs in modern impres-
sionist style. Australians are more inter-
ested in the art of Conder than in the more
remote Brangwyn, because the former
frankly admitted his indebtedness to a few
years’ residence in this sunny clime. Thea
Iroctor follows the Conder way, but the
times are not opportune in England for
these superfluous toys. Thea was ruralising
in Oxfordshire towards the end of 1914, but
she buttoned on her overall and settled
down in her Chelsea studio before the New
Lear peeped through the fog.
Ada Reeve, the fair-haired vaudeville
charmer who was bubbling over with the
joy of life during her season at Sydney
Tivoli, has been seriously ill and blames
the return voyage for it. She is, however,
reported to be on the road to a good
recovery.
The war blouse is a feature of the latest
London fashions. It is built of khaki or red
diaphanous material, with a suggestion of
red, white and blue in almost invisible beads.
Even that useful accessory, the handbag,
which can be so conveniently snatched, is
now khaki. Embroidered with the Allies’
flags, it is the thing for the girl who is
(or was) walking out or keeping company
with someone in uniform.
Scientist Oliver Lodge, whose long, white
locks bung over the rim of his collar during
the Sydney Blue-Socks conference, is now
renewing his remarks on the World Beyond
the Funeral Service. The optimistic Lodge
recently told an English audience that he
had conversed with friends on the other side
of ether. When he lectured here one Sunday
in a similar strain our highbrows had a craze
for scientific spook anecdotes and mysterious
dreams. But the wave receded, and is now
washing up the crabs on other shores.
Professor Delmer, a former resident in
Australia, has been for years in charge of
the English language at Berlin ’Varsity. He
is reported to be still thorn arm •
health. He is much wanted
when the armed German f . '
British line under a white Hag
“lioch der Whitechapel,” he required ia h i? UtS
his British accent in good working orSr die
his pretence of being a Cameron Highlander
in a spiked helmet might fail to pass muste?
Following a series of well-deserved mascu-
line howls in the press re the barkinSw
nuisance, “Cornelia” who has a sharp S
to her nose, I imagine, rushes in to defend
the fool canine that disturbs the pubfic
peace by shouting in the middle of the nigh?
that he will slay the tortoiseshell cat next
door. She advises the victims of the noisv
curs to strengthen thier nerves” and “gain
more self-control. Briefly, instead of sit-
ting up in bed to curse the street cur or the
adjacent and howling dog. the infuriated
male person should control his desire to sleen
lu peace. lie should heave a sigh of relief
and remember that lie lives in a noisy world
Cornelia falls off the edge of this argu-
ment by flinging a cheap sneer at the brain-
workers who complain of riotous night puds
(which can sleep their days away), when
their fellows are disturbed in the* trenches
with the shriek of shells. Unfortunately
shells are, just now, a necessary nuisance.
But the Towzer that barks all night, from
sheer cussedness, is not necessary to anyone
outside a Dogs’ Home.
The Blue Cross League, which is stretch-
es out its tentacles in Australia, looks
after the war-horse in the matter of band-
ages and other comforts during its career
at the Front. Mrs. Rose-Soley, Red Cross
vyorkroom, 145 a Castlereagh-street, will
gladly forward any contributions to the Lou-
don president, Lady Smith-Dorrien. When
1 eace flaps its bedraggled wings over Europe,
some inventive mind will have to suggest an
entirely unknown color to commemorate the
event. How about a Pale Kaiser League
trimmed with Bear’s Whiskers?
. Lven the Boy Scout, a futile little animal
m times of peace, has been turned to use in
these days of war. Instead of going off in
hordes to attack fried chops in the fastnesses
of Narrabeen, the small boy under the wide
sombrero is encouraged to haunt the Red
Cross work-rooms, where he does the fetching
and carrying. I suppose he learns his school-
lessons now and again; but, before the
Christmas holidays gave the work-ladies a
well-earned rest, the Boy seemed to spend
his life staggering round street corners under
heavy baggage. Now, he is going to have a
party for himself. Scout Week will begin
with an out-door demonstration at Sydney
Sports Ground, on January 19. Then wiil
the military infant show what he can do
with an axe and a log, and how he can light
a Camp-fire without burning his pants or
the surrounding country. A modest charge
of sixpence will enable the public to watch
the Boy on the warpath. The cash will go
into a money-box for the expansion of the
infant Scout movement.
Solicitor H. Baron, of Dunedin (M.L.),
is over here to wind up the affairs of his
late father. The old gentleman, who was
one of the pioneer settlers in the bumpy
M.L. town, spent 50 years there before he
started roaming. He came here a while ago
and passed out.
The youthful Sydney fiddler, Lionel Law-
son, is now sheltering in Kent with his
mother and sister. They were in Germany—
Lionel at his bow-work and his sister
wrestling wth the enemy’s methods of teach-
ing the piano—when the Kaiser pulled oaNbds
mailed boots.
The Ernest Brooke pair have settled down
for a while in London. Their Australian
headquarters are Melbourne, but Mrs. Ernest
generally switches her attention on to the
iatest frivolities in clothes from the altitude
of a Sydney flat.
One of the new complications that threaten
the domestic hearth is the vexed note of in-
terrogation that surrounds the position of a
woman whose legal lord belongs to the
0011 ntry. It cuts both ways. A
5.5. u. man, Mr. Charlie Holroyd, spent
10 years as engineer in Hamburg shipyards,
lie married a German lady, who is now
threatened with internment in her native
land as a British subject. The former Syd-
ney man has, since the War blew the top
on: the volcano, been working at his profes-
sion in British shipping centres, but his wife
and children are still in the Kaiser’s antbed.
Ihe crux of the situation is that engineer
Holroyd states “none of my letters, to re-
assure my wife as to the treatment of Ger-
man women in England, ever reach her.”
The Futurist skirt—a new menace to
pedestrians—is pleated round the feet. Over
this narrow bolster is worn a billowy upper
garment. But the width of the ballet de-
partment is no help to the feet, which are
more or less hobbled. A lady who tries to
negotiate George-street at 5 p.m. in one of
these Futurist freaks will not only feel
annoyed herself, but will worry the adjacent
traffic* with the flap of her balloon top-
storey.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

Æ
To Re-color
GREY HAIR
THE ONLY EFFECTIVE AND GUARAN-
TEED PERMANENT HAIR COLORING.
Loss of Hair Coloring is one of the most distressing problems
that man or woman has to face, yet. may be overcome quite easily
by the application of “Inecto” —the only perfect Hair Coloring.
“Inecto” completely permeates the hair structures and becomes part
of the hair itself; if will withstand damp, can be shampooed, does
not come out on the brush, or soil the linen, and imparts a glossy appearance that defies detection.
Ǽ
We can recommend ‘‘luefto” to restore Grey Hair to its natural coloring. A single application
only is necessary, and full instructions are given with each bottle. “Jnecto” is made up in small
quantities, which prevents waste, for after being onee exposed to the air chemical change renders
it useless.

NO MORE FAT PEOPLE.
Most fat people seem to think that the
only way to take off fat is to use dangerous
drugs, follow a starvation diet or take
strenuous exercise. But all this is nonsense,
and, thanks to the recent discovery of an
eminent scientist, thousands of men and
women are taking off several pounds of
useless fat a week by simply rubbing on to
the fat part—hips, arms, chin or abdomen —
a simple lotion made by pouring a cup of
hot water over a dram of quassia chips; let
it stand for a minute, then strain through a
cloth and add three ounces of Cirola Bark
Extract. Pour the mixture into a bottle and
apply night and morning, rubbing it in with
the hands for about 10 minutes, using a
circular motion, and the fat will almost
seem to melt away before your very eyes.
The ingredients, which are inexpensive, may
be had of any chemist, and the results to be
obtained are really remarkable.*
MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne. January 1.1, 3,014.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Ida Watson Cooper Yestelle says she
“loathes the stage,” but she wants the
money. She omits, by the way, to
mention how much she isn’t making. She
left Ostend four days before War broke out,
and she would return there to-morrow only
her mamma will not allow it. So she acts
and acts and tries to Forget. She is living
at the George Hotel, and she longs for free-
dom. In fact, she yearns for it. What
she hankers for most is to be a nurse —to
soothe the pain-and-anguish-racked brow
of the wounded hero, and perhaps act for
him, and mayhap dance, and in other
respects play the role of a human buck-up
drop. At one time she could easily have
got to the front as a nurse with one of the
Duchess or Countess outfits that, were teem-
ing in Flanders ; but the man Kitchener is
making it difficult now for anyone but a
highly-qualified nurse to get a look-in any-
where.
Aubrey Hoad —son of the dead Major-
General —has been wounded. lie is in hos-
pital at Liverpool and reports to some
Melbourne friends that he is getting on all
right.
Charlie Wheeler, a young Melbourne
painter, who gave promise of doing pretty
well in the business, has dropped out of art
circles since he got to England. At latest
he was a Royal Fusilier in training for a
career at the Front. Physically he is smart
and active; and as for his pluck—well,
didn’t he take up Art for a living.
Ethel Castilla has had a nice helping of
marmalade from London Daily Chronicle.
Her Australian Lullaby is declared to “de-
serve a place in every anthology of baby
poems.” Honorable mention is made, too,
<>f her odes to Collins-street, to Clara Butt,
and to the moppy-headed Paderewski. It is
furthermore certified that she “writes with
ihat sharp virility which marks the Colonial
writer” —which is very nice, though some-
body should drop a line to the Chronicle
telling it that “Colonial” is now a low-class
word applicable only to tinpot, twopenny-
ha’penny corners.
"Sassiety abroad has dropped black for
mourning purposes. Fashionable folk mourn
now with a purple arm-band for one fallen
in the army and a white band for someone
blown to pieces or drowned in the navy.
Is it the thin edge of a wedge? Shall we
he mourning presently in blue and pink?
Then sweet indeed will be the uses of ad-
versity.
Amy Castles has been very ill since she
arrived here. She couldn’t go to a solitary
Christmas or New Year party, and that to
Amy, who likes her victuals, was misery
indeed.
Kathleen Mcßride, daughter of Peter, the
Agent-General, is collecting cigarettes and
cigars for the soldiers in London. I men-
tion this in case you should wrong a good
and helpful girl, who has been well brought
up and is patriotic to the back teeth, by
fancying that, in these distressful times, she
is leading a life of soulless gaiety.
All the available Governors in this State
and their wives, not to mention Drysdale
Brown, Minister for Forests, went forth
dauntlessl.v last week amongst the more or
less wild folk who inhabit our woods. Many
perils were met and overcome and the casu-
alties were few. In fact, the only mishap
occurred when the Hon. Minister bumped
his nose in trying to jump a log at Apollo
Bay. The idea of the natives thereabouts is
that Brown must know more about Minister-
ing than he does about horsemanship. Other-
wise why should lie be a Minister?
On the journey Lady Helen “installed” a
bush nurse. Governors’ wives do these jobs
when opportunity occurs very much in the
same way as the infrequent parson of former
days christened children of all ages and
celebrated marriages of devoted couples for
whom the benefit of the clergy was long
overdue.
Charlotte Hemming, the energetic recitress
who engineered a Belgian Relief entertain-
ment in the Town Hall, formally handed over
the proceeds the other day. The Mayoress
received them, and amongst those present
were her husband, Mrs. J. Alston, Mrs. Ben-
jamin Hoare and Mrs. Robert Walker. As
the outcome of the whole kindly agitation
£254 will go to the Belgian nuns.
“Rosna” tells me from London :
Dr. Rupert Reynell, S. Australia’s Rhodes Scholar,
who has been mending the wounded in Lady Dudley’s
Australian hospital in France, was in the casualty
list the other day. But the story of wounds turned
out to be one of old Mrs. Rumor’s embroideries. It
was a germ, and not a German, that had got him
down, and he was returned to London to have his
appendix amputated.
Bryceson Treharne, the musician from Adelaide,
has been dug up. He is at Ruhleben, near
Berlin, with about 4000 other British prisoners of
war. His wife has just got back to London from
Berlin, and is preparing to move Heaven and earth
and even George Reid to get her civilian husband
released. She reports that, in spite of snowy
weather, many of the prisoners are allowed only tent
accommodation, and Bryeeson is delicate. But it is
doubtful whether even this pathetic appeal will move
the heart of the Butcher.
Victor Nelson Hoorl has returned to his
job at Government 11 mse. He was one of
Governor Strickland's multitudinous Helps,
but pleaded ill-health after a brief spell with
that unusual potentate, and settled down
in Victoria. He is a sound performer in his
chosen line. But how comes it that one
with such a name is out of the fighting line?
I suppose he reckons that they also serve
who only stand and Help.
Rockefeller the Younger, a smart young
Yank with spectacles and the national habit
of dyspepsia, has given a hospital ship to
the Allies, It contains a fully-fitted hospital
for each Ally—right down to little Servia.
A hospital on a ship is no particular use to
Servia, since it can’t get its wounded to the
sea. Still the intention is good, and the.
gallant little nation of tiger-cats will be
grateful acordingly.
Dorothy Yane Menzies is drifting back to
her old profession. Her original idea was to
play ingenue parts for one of the J.C.W.
musical comedy shows, but that fell through
somehow, and now she is preparing for a
vaudeville career. She will be seen “on the
Halls” quite soon.
The Walter Manifolds have given a fully-
equipped motor-ambulance to the Defence
Department. It is a 20-horse-power Wol-
seley. The Department can well do with a
dozen more; so you can go on talking. It
will cost you only £550 to speak.
The Mackays have begun racing again.
Before the War stopped their plans, Fan
Dango Mackay’s husband sold all his horses,
except a few youngsters that were “coming
on.” and prepared for a foreign tour with
the family. Even Radnor was sold (at a
brilliant price) to Leigh Falkiner. Europe
being unfit for travel, they are now taking
horses over to the Hobart races, and are
preparing for an exciting time in the Apple
Island.
The Apple Islanders themselves are feel-
ing perky. The War is a long, long way
off. The drought has broken. Their coun-
try is green again, and they are getting top
prices for everything that they grow. Syd-
ney and Melbourne people are flocking to
their shores, holiday money in hand. Alto-
gether the prospects for the coming season
look a good deal brighter in the Tasman
than they do in (say) the North Sea.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
Dr. Cowan, of Rose Park, who was in England
when the cloud burst, is with the hospital for Indian
troops at Brockenhurst. He is in charge of the
X-ray work. F. M. Cutlaek, who was studying law,
has secured a commission in the Royal Field Artil-
lery. He comes from Renmark, where his people
were some of the first settlers. You may remember
him as the one pressman who came to the Common-
wealth aboard the Australia on the warship’s first
voyage.
The Cavalier-Butler marriage is fixed for January
12. Also Miss Mary Bowyer will wed Mr. McLennan
on the ICth. The Alan MacFarlanes’ eldest daughter
is engaged to Roy, eldest son of Dr. and Mrs. Hum-
phrey Marten. And Rumor hints mysteriously at
other pending alliances.
Miss Winifred Crabbe arrives from England, via the
U.S., in the Sonoma next week.
The J. H. Symons allowed the “Girl Guides” to
make a Christmas-New Year camp on their grounds
at Upper Sturt. The girls turned up in droves, and
so did their relatives and friends. Meanwhile the
male head of the Symon family fled with a couple
of his daughters to Kangaroo Island.
Kangaroo Island has this year recovered some of
its lost popularity. But Victor Harbor remains first
favorite among the southern resorts. The exodus
from the city is quite unusual, and various seaside
places are booming as they never boomed before.
The city’s long drought is largely responsible for
the general clearing-out.
One Harold Feast w T as fined £5 for having kissed
a girl on New Year’s Eve. It seems an appalling
price. The magistrate must have got his estimate
of the value of these caresses at bazaars.
Mrs. Neil Campbell arrived from Westralia on
Monday. Her husband, who served in the Boer War,
has volunteered again, and leaves soon with a com-
mission in his pocket.
Mrs. Cruickshank, who was once the Mayoress of
this city’s port, gave a big dinner-party to the boys
of the cadet ship Tadanga at the Outer Harbor. It
was a birthday party to the glory of her son Errol,
who is at the War. A real grown-up menu was sent
aboard, and the best red-white-and-blue flower decora-
tions Adelaide could supply. Captain McDermott
and his boys shattered the ill-used old welkin of the
Outer Harbor with their cheers when the generous
little lady (she measures about five-foot-nothing)
slipped away in her motor-launch.
At local boarding-houses, in Downing-
street, London, and in other well-informed
spots, it is regai-ded as a sure thing that
Mahaffy, some time of Fiji, but now Admin-
istrator of Dominica in the Lesser Antilles,
will ultimately return to his old haunts as
Governor. The natives of Fiji love him. So
do the officials. They like his self-eliminat-
ing modesty. In that case Mrs. Enid Boyd
Mahaffy, of Victoria, will be a proud woman
—but not obviously so, for nothing irritates
like patent pride, as witness the case of the
Kaiser. No: she will be proud furtively
and blush all over to find it fame.
Talking of Fiji brings me to Kadavu, the
Great Ratu Kadavu Levu, who died there
last month, aged only 44. Kadavu was an
oyer-lord and a superman and a colored in-
dividual of great parts. His grandfather,
Ratu Cakobau, began British history in Fiji.
Cakobau, who amongst other attractions was
a cannibal, ceded the Fijian Archipelago to
Britain in 1875 and did well for his country-
men thereby. He gave up Cannibalism
after a while for Cricket. Our very own
Wallington was chiefly responsible, which
shows what a power for good even an A.D.C.
can be on occasion. Ratu Kadavu, just
departed, loved cricket too. Cheap jesters
used to say he was ratty about it. He owned,
amongst other tilings, a temple, placed mag-
nificently on the heights. In it lie had en-
shrined portraits of all the most illustrious
cricketers, together with sacred objects, like
bats, bails and balls used at historical
matches. I am not sure that he hadn’t the
heads of a few prominent umpires. Cricket
had a civilising effect on Kadavu. As long
as he was playing, lie had no more desire
to head-hunt than Clem Hill or Vernon
Ransford, but the moment lie had been given
out leg- before to a palpable off-break the old
primitive instincts surged up in him, and
he went straight into the pavilion to look
for his battle-axe.
He was King of Bau—a small island
lying alongside the mainland of Fiji. The
people of Bau are great sailors. They liken
their island to Britain, and their canoes and
tremendous exploits to the ships and doings
of the British Navy. Kadavu was edu-
cated at Singleton (N.S.W.), but he retained
his native way of living. Always he was
King, and always the lesser chiefs squatted
in his presence.
Ratu Gala, his next chief in ascendancy,
is keenly European. He is the only Fijian
potentate who wears European clothes. La la
has yachts and carriages and horses and
servants, all run in the smartest European
style. Kadavu had arranged to marry
Lala’s daughter, but the naughty little girl
ran away from school (in Maoriland), and
married a white carpenter. Her dreadful
crime helped to break up the health of
Kadavu. who felt the position keenly. The
absconder was practically the only girl lie
could marry and retain his dignity.
It, is a horrible thing for the descendant of
a thousand cannibals to be cut out by a
carpenter. The inexplicable thing to Ratu
was the fact that the interloping operative
was one of the poorest cricketers in the
South Island—barely up to fifth-rate form.
The Dandies at St. Ivilda, being now. under
cover, are raking in the couples who find the
weather on the beach too inclement for love-
making. The show has adopted a new
stage-toning business. When there are ghost
songs the stage is blue. When Belgian Cor-
de-bly plays tragic music on his fiddle,
everything is a gory red. The other turns
are “toned” similarly. The Dandies also do
business with supper-patrons. The old
Yacht Club house is trimmed (from the cosy
inside) with wicked red silk shaded lamp's
that gleam alluringly through the windows
from feeding tables on stormy, grey even-
ings.
John Amadio, the flautist, married, last
week, Leonora Roberts, whose debonair papa
is the chairman of the Stock Exchange, and
in that capacity allows himself to be kissed
by popular actresses once a year—on
Wattle Day—in the cause of charity. The
event transpired at St. Leonard’s, Brighton
Beach. Leonora, in the part of the heroine,
was an Alpine vision in white crepe ninon
and lace, over white satin, and her sister
Molly, in pink, supported her throughout
the performance. The academic Johnny
Erskine filled the office of bottle-holder to
the hero. The principals are now honey-
mooning among the hills of Healsville.
Mrs. Grundy is beginning to say that the
thing must certainly stop. Yet, so far, she
isn’t saying it here with the London em-
phasis. There the wife of the Dean of
Westminster Abbey is leading the protest
against “the undisciplined behavior of young
girls and women, who loiter about the
streets, pestering and importuning men to
contribute to relief funds.” But even the
collecting-box won’t carry a glad eye as far
as a bundle of French or Belgian news-
napers. Of course if you’re carrying a
bundle of French or Belgian newspapers
you’re a refugee, and-—-well, if we’re a man,
we must stop and buy a paper from her,
mustn’t we, even though it does lead to con-
fidences and one thing and another.
Muriel Starr is exceedingly frocky in
“Bought and Paid For,” as is to be expected
of the purchased wife of a multi-millionaire.
She wears a duck of a dress—a stiff silk,
very-much-looped-up affair, made in a dark,
dull olive-green, which is a color Paris had
just decided to pronounce It or Chic or The
Thing before the war came along and
changed everything to sable. There is
another dress, also in sombre green, which
is all embroidery and ninon, and with a good
deal of pink flesh showing; through. A
dreamy sea-green chiffon dressing-gown,
clasped with a gold band round the million-
airess’s hips, and worn over a ergpe-de-chine
nightie, is donned for the reception of the
drunken husband. This amply justifies his
stock line, “You zer-t’nly doo loo’ sweet
to-night.” She wears a railroad-track of
baby roses for a nightcap to clinch matters.
Another dress is a stunner, of green cloth
and stone-marten fur. She says “good-bye
for evah” to her dissolute husband in it. and
it makes one sorry to think that, hound
though he is. he should be losing the chance
of seeing so much lovely haberdashery.
For the eleventh year running “Peter
Pan” is the Christmas attraction at London
Duke of York’s Theatre. This time the
shoes of J. M. Barrie’s immortal boy who
would not grow up are filled by one of our
girls—Madge Titheradge. She is the fourth
Peter at this theatre, her predecessors hav-
ing been Nina Boucicault, Cissie Loftus and
Pauline Chase. Pauline was married a few
weeks ago, whereon Madge was selected to
fill the vacancy.
If this wretched War goes on much longer
there won’t be an A.D.C. in the place under
70. All the glorious imported creatures are
gone already, taking with them (for obvious
reasons) the uniforms we loved so well. And
now the local youths who filled their places
are beginning to get restless. They sa v
that it is an absurd and anomalous' thine
to dress Tip as a 98tli Fencible or what not
and be addressed as captain, when you know
nothing of war and are patently 'incapable
ot captaining a wherry. So, as I said before'
doddering old generals and other impossible
characters will be all that the smart <nrl
will have to flirt with presently.
A perfectly ridiculous thing has happened
to Lord Tennyson’s son, Lionel, who is at
the Front with the Rifle Brigade. After
passing through the horrors of Mons, Le
Gateau, La Fere and the rest without in-
jury—in brief, after carrying his life in his
open hand for about five months—he lias
just missed death by falling down a hole.
He was leading a reconaissance at night
when he encountered the hole, which had
been dug by a shell. As a result he is now
in hospital suffering from a grievously
wounded leg and shock. He was at school
when the Tennysons were Governor-General-
ling here, and in the last few years has de-
veloped into a hurricane county cricketer.
Our late Admiral King-Hall is now
director of the British and Foreign Sailors
Society. In that capacity he has issued an
appeal for £lO,OOO. To say that lie will get
it in a minute or so is to insist upon the
obvious. In Britain the raising of £lO,OOO
for a war purpose is easier than falling into
a pawnshop.
A lady named Mrs. Irene Osgood has just
launched a book with the rather glittering
title, “The Indelicate Duellist.” Evidently
dazed by the combat in Europe, the authoress
pauses to ask the world : “Which is the more
commendable —the duel between individuals,
or the duel between nations, that: we call
war?” Perhaps, the world, when it is limp-
ing back to convalescence, and taking its
limbs out of splints, may find time to answer
this question. It savors of the banal queries
that Annie Swan answers over the teacups
in her worthy but exceedingly dull maga-
zine.
The cable says that Strutt, the
artist, is dead; and it doesn't say which
Strutt. Presuming it is William, the father,
he has interest for us in that he was in
Victoria 60 years ago, and painted four pic-
tures which certainly ought to be accessible
to Melbourne. First, there is liis well-known
“Black Thursday,” depicting a scene on that
unparalleled day in 1851. Then there is a
much-valued drawing of the Victorian Parlia-
ment of 1855 —St. Patrick’s Hall was the
meeting place—with portraits of Speaker
Palmer, O’Shanassy, Fawkner, Haines, and
other notabilities. His- painting of “The Find-
ing of Burke and Wills.” with portraits of
llowitt and others present, is said not to be so
good as Longstaff’s painting: but Melbourne
would like it. The fourth work is very
remarkable, and only came to my knowledge
through an English reproduction. It is a
painting, or colored drawing, of an actual
occurrence —18 men and women stuck up
and robbed by bushrangers on St. Kilda-
road, only about a mile from Melbourne.
Certanly this picture ought to be in the
Melbourne National Gallery. Jt is said to
be in England. What interest can it possibly
have there? No more than Barry Sullivan's
Melbourne playbills, which that conceited
genius presented to the British Museum!
As to Strutt generally, he contributed 61
paintings to the Royal Academy and some to
the Paris Salon.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.
The episcopal cadger has been at it again
in London. This time it is Dr. Sadleir, the
Bishop of Nelson (MX.), and formerly a
canon of St. Ivilda (Melb). It was at a
meeting of the Colonial and Continental
Church Society that he lifted up his voice
and wept at the poverty of his parsons, then
dried his tears and went round with the hat.
His awful example was a clergyman who
tramped 2000 miles last year and got only
£65 for it. He thinks the pious whaler
ought to have at least £100; so the British
charitable public is asked, in pity and kind-
ness to poor Maoriland, to stump up the
other £35. Maoriland is heavily mortgaged,
no doubt; still, if it had been given notice,
it might have made an effort to find the £35
and thereby dodged this dreadful advertise-
ment.
It is a significant fact that, whereas three
out of six N. S; Wales Chief Justices have
died in harness and one on leave, no less
than 21 out of 26 puisne Judges (not count-
ing present occupants in either case) have
retired prior to death —in some cases many
years prior to death. The explanation seems
to be simple; whereas an ordinary Judge
retires when he feels that he isn’t fit for his
job, the Chief Justice hangs on because he is
more or less of an ornament and a social
figure as well as a Judge, and he believes he
can be an ornament and a social figure as
well at 80 as at 55, and that partial deafness
and dulness and blindness don’t matter.
Hence for the sake of the social position, for
which he may be fitted, he hangs on to a
judicial position for which he usually isn’t
fitted. If not, how comes it that more than
half of the Chief Justices hold to their jobs
and die in them, while more than one-fifth
of the other Judges step down before the end
comes?

“The Oldest Inhabitant”: .January 26
(Anniversary Bay) will be the fiftieth anniversary
of the shooting of Constable Nelson, at Kimberley’s
Hotel, Collector (N.S.W.), by bushranger Dunn.
This young ruffian (he was only 19 when he was
hanged), Ben Hall and Johnny Gilbert had stuck up
the hotel. A messenger took the news to the lock-up
and Nelson, the keeper, immediately jumped into
his uniform and took his carbine to the scene.
His wife and friends advised him not to meet the
trio; but he refused to be persuaded from duty.
Dunn shot him dead without warning before he
reached the pub. Nelson’s son, who was holding
the horses of the outlaws, saw his father killed.
Hall and Gilbert were, later, shot dead by the
police. Dunn was badly wounded, but the gaol
doctors patched him for the gallows. A generous
Government gave widow Nelson a pension of £l5
per year, and not a penny less.
“N. or M.” : St. Kilda’s Abbey at Whitby
was partially destroyed by the Germans in their
recent effort to spread culture along the unfortified
Yorkshire coast. The foundation dates back to 566,
and the present building was run up somewhere in
the 11th century. Its famous abbess and name-
saint was a miracle-worker of considerable voltage in
her time, and was noted, like St. Patrick, for hav-
ing a derry on snakes. She turned those in her
vicinity to stone. Walter Scott relates that the
birds flying across the sacred precincts of the Abbey
sank down and paid homage. Anyone may still find
the small stony serpents neatly coiled on Whitby
beaches, each with its head broken off. Scientists
call them ammonites. They know no better.

“Dirge" : It was the evening after the
Bushtown races, and both of us had looked on the
beer when it frothed. So when at 11 o’clock the
publican pushed us out into the stilly night and
told us that the shortest way down to the camp
was through his paddock, we believed him. We
had two gates to go through. The first was all
right, but the second was locked. In fact, it didn’t
seem to have any hinges. During the next hour
or so we climbed 27 of these hingeless gates until
we got full up and decided to walk back to the
pub. On tlie way back we climbed 29 gates and
still there was no sign of the pub. That settled it.
We laid down and tried to forget that there was
such a thing as a gate in Queensland. When we
awoke we found that we had been wandering on
the racecourse and had been climbing the hurdles on
the track which had been used the day before.

Eddyson : “Paddy Driscoll married
Shelah Done iv a Chewsdee,” said Flynn. “Paddy

“Clementina Dishcloth”: The cocky is a
splendid optimist but a rotten weather prophet. I’ve
just put in a month in the droughty Riverina, off-
siding for a chap who didn’t get a single bag of
wheat, and who was driving his horse to water because
his own tanks were dry. For the first three days the
thermometer went up beyond HOdeg. once at least
every 24 hours. Every evening at tea-time the boss
had the same yarn: “Gripes, it’s ’ot! Getter
thunner-storm outter this, sure as eggs!’’ Tea-time
third day: “Strewth, that’s funny! Must be th’
drooth! Never known it ter miss before.” Fourth
day we had to cut our way through the flies to get
to the jam. “.fever see ennythin’ like ’em?” says
the boss. If it don’t rain after this, it never will.”
Next morning it was still dry, and there were
millions of ants about. “Ants gettin’ busy—knows
a thing or two,” says cocky; and he fished a dozen
out of the butter. “We better ’urrv up with that
fencin’ or tli’ rain’ll beat us.” Breakfast next day—
no wash as usual. “See the sunset lars’ night?”
“No.” “Set be’ind a bank o’ cloud ; surest sign of
rain I knows.” It was hot as H—l for a week. He
kept this up for another fortnight. Once he saw a
black cockatoo and nearly went mad about it;
among other things he cleaned out the drains to the
tanks. The wind blew from the east, and the boss
wanted to bring the horses into the kitchen “case
they gits drownded.” They stayed out and nearly got
sunstruck. Then we had- a new moon, and it came
in before mid-day. “Goin’ t’ rain; nothin’ surer.”
And as if that wasn’t enough it came in standing up
on end, and everyone knows when it does that it is
tipping out the rain. A jamtin was immediately
nailed on the fence for a rain gauge. Then he got
hold of a yarn that the blacks along the river had
shifted their camps to the high ground (which I
believe was a fact) because there were going- to be
floods. That settled it. “What with th’ blacks an’
th’ flies an’ th’ ants an’ the ’ot weather an’ th’ moon
and oil that, if it don’t rain within 48 hours, I’ll be
d—d!” And he might have been for all I know
The house was blown away in a dust-storm next dav’
and I left.
“Manly Beach”: On Sunday I paid 3d.
to see the body of one of the Lord Mayor’s best
friends a 14-foot shovel-nose shark who had mis-
taken a junk of over-ripe baby-whale thrown out by
a commercial-minded fisherman for one of the
Mayor’s gamey presents taken to sea in a municipal
rubbish-punt. And what more useful follower could
a garbage-strewing Lord Mayor desire than a shovel-
nose shark! Town clerks, orderlies, city solicitors,
maintenance men—none of these will relieve him
FATLY COMPLACENT PERSON: “My wife is an angel , sir—an angel.”
CYNICAL FRIEND: “Sa, very sad. When did she die?”
of his dreadful burden by devouring it, as Shovel-
nose does. To offer a dead cat to a town clerk
would be to court the rebuff that conies the way of
the lunatic who casts pearls before swine. The only
fault I can see about a'partnership which benefits
both sides is that one of the municipal shovel-nosed
retinue which follows the offal barges may one day
make a bad mistake and partially eat a surfer in
mistake for a dead dog. Personally I would not
like to die suddenly with the suspicion in my
mind that I had been mistaken for a dead dog, and
that a disgusted banquet friend of the Lord Mayor’s
had found me to be a worthless imitation.

“Lagani-Namo”: Thunderstorms (B.
10/12/14)? M ell, I've been on their visiting list
in various parts of the Pacific and around Australia
and I have never experienced any comparable with
those of the interior of Papua during the wet season.
If all the sieg’e guns and mines and torpedoes and
rifles and revolvers and language in use in the war
were brought together and exploded simultaneously
it would give a good idea of one storm that I
vividly remember. A mate and I; with 10 natives,
had cut our way through the scrub to a creek, and
pitched camp in an angle on a high bank. At
4 p.m., just as things were shipshape, the dis-
turbance broke loose. Thunder and lightning burst
in a paean of crashes and flashes that seemed designed
to destroy the earth. A deafening peal would bang
against a mountain and roll reverberating like a
volley of artillery along the gorges. The earth
fairly shook, and the sky was ripped and blotched
with blinding jets of fire. After one terrific crash
the coastal niggers flung themselves in a body into
our tents and whimpered and shivered with terror.
On every side could be heard the boom of falling
trees. The rain fairly screamed and hissed with
malevolence, and a torrent of water a couple of feet
deep swished through the camp. What had been a
sparse trickle was soon swollen to a broad, brown
stream with its surface all lashed into spate. Logs
up to 6ft. in diameter went bobbing along on it as
though they were safety matches. Occasionally
during a flash of lightning there would be a series
of sharp detonations, followed by a prolonged and
travelling crash. Toward 3 a.m., as though
satisfied with its performance, the storm suddenly
ceased. If it had lasted much longer I’d have died
of concussion.
Oiwai . Ihe Papuan i s no t the only
individual prone to dig up valuables that were
buried with the dear departed. One Anderson died
on a lonely claim on the Olkora, in northern Papua
and was buried by his “boys,” who brought his
belongings in to Tamata. They explained to th
Warden, who was also deputy-curator of intestate
estates, that, except for a little gold in a “calico ”
winch they produced, the hatter’s three months'
clean-up was in a belt
round his waist, and
they had not cared, for
various reasons, to re-
move it. The War-
den thereupon started
on a 60-mile tramp,
with the unpleasant
job of exhumation at
the end of it. He
found that the grave
had been opened and
the body, which the
“boys” said they had
buried in its clothing,
had been half-stripped.
■There was no belt and
no gold. The “boys”
could hardly be sus-
pected, since gold-
stealing was almost
unknown in the North-
ern Division; more-
over, owing to strict
ordinances, the buying
of gold from a native,
except in a few places
like Sudest, where
natives work it them-
selves, is a dangerous
game. Also, they were
so thoroughly searched
before being shipped
home south that any
doubt was removed.
Presumably some
thrifty individual had
got the story from the
“boys” on their way
through the camps
down to Tamata, and
had acted upon it.
The irony of thing,-*-!, Six inches of water
in the Murray at the Darling- junction; 12ft. in the
principal streets of Petersburg, the railway junction
town between Adelaide and Broken Hill. Petersburg
has had three floods within a month, but the heavy
rainfall obstinately refrains from getting down as
far as Adelaide. Feed has come on rapidly, and
now, for a change, the usually dry northern parts
of S. Aus. are offering to paddock the suffering stock
from the usually moist southern region.
* v. • * *
Lagani-N. : In Fiji, the Solomnos, and
New Hebrides, ere' the white folic interfered, the
natives practised a sort of suttee. When a chief
died his principal wife, or in some cases all the
wives, after doing a share of the wailing, would
elect to follow the deceased to a better world. The
Hebridean custom was for the wife to lie in a hole
and be smothered with sand. It was the duty of
her nearest of kin to trample her expeditiously to
death. In Fiji the devoted widow would simply
squat tailor-fashion while young men put a turn of
a cord around her neck and pulled steadily at each
end until she became a spirit.

“The Reefer”: For devoted wives go to
Papua. Sir William Macgregor once related that he
met “a woman plodding along bent double beneath
a load of firewood. She held one end of a length of
lawyer cane, and at the other end walked her
blind husband. The man was literally smothered
with sores, and the greater portion of his face was
eaten away by lupus. The corrosion had invaded
and destroyed his eyes, and he was unique in his
ugliness and deformity. On giving the woman a
little tobacco she smiled in the most devoted and
affectionate manner into what remained of her hus-
band s face and gave him - the weed.” Wee Mac
said that the man was the most loathsome husband
and the woman the most devoted wife he had ever
seen.

THE CHANGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Still is the languid air,
And heavy hangs the night
With sultry purple glare ;
And dead is all delight.
No song or scent is sweet,
No wind lifts, not a breath ;
The bush is swooning in the drought and heat,
Staring at fate and death.
No wind lifts, no cloud passes.
Crickets in mockery
Chirp from the withered grasses.
The sheep fall wearily,
Feeble and faint, the sheep,
Beside dry wells, spent streams:
And men are troubled with unquiet sleep,
And wake from eerie dreams.
Still is the languid air,
And heavy hangs the night
With sultry, purple glare.
Men’s hearts are straitened tight.
Will never hope return
To broaden breasts of men!
They watch the red moon, watch the bushfires
burn,
And hope no more... . And then
A noise behind the hills
Whirring, a tale of wonder,
The haggard forest thrills ;
Streaked lightnings flash, and thunder
Roars from the breaking sky,
South winds with north are clashing,
With sudden sweep the stsrm is raging by,
In torrents rains are crashing.
And earth has flowery smells,
And birds begin to sing
At dawn, and cattle-bells
Through dripping gullies ring.
The winds have ceased to fight,
But steady pours the rain,
And tanks and wells are gurgling with delight—
The bush breathes free again.

To 3lr. John Craven Burleigh,
Dear Sir, —Your True Hair Grower is a wonderful
preparation. I have used it with great success for
falling hair, and also find that it imparts a delightful
texture to the hair, making it soft and silky, and
bringing out all the natural color with a vivid
brightness.—Yours truly,

MR. CRAVEN BURLEIGH.
(From a recent photograph.)
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business man.
My hair began to grow thin about the time X reached the
age of thirty. When I had reached the age of thirty-five
the top of my head was quite bald. I had considerable
pride, and sought for something to cause renewed growth.
I invested in every preparation that I could see or hear of,
and here let me say that not only did I try all the English
so-called restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many sover-
eigns and considerable time —yet the hairs came not. I had
given up the idea of ever growing hair again. One after-
noon, while enjoying a brief business respite by an Alpine
trip, I fell in with an old collegiate chemist, whose hair was
particularly plentiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished
lie could spare some of his hair for my benefit. This led
him to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a for-
mula and suggested that I have a quantity of the compound
prepared. I did this a few days later. I was astonished
to see the hair coming forth after several applications, and
within six weeks my head was covered with a firm, yet
soft, growth of hair. Since then the hair on my head has
been as luxuriant as when in my school days. Having
arranged for the legal right to do so, I have for some time
been privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people who
have actually grown new hair through the medium of my
true hair-grower. I do not pretend to say it is the only
hair-grower in the world- —I am not interested in deci y ing
others—-but Ido assert that it is the most reliable, and in
the end by far the cheapest.

Mr. John Craven Burleigh,
Dear Sir,—l am enclosing herewith one of my
photographs, to give you some idea how my hair has
improved since using your True Hair Grower.
Before I commenced its use my hair was falling in
handfuls and I was also greatly troubled with
dandruff. However, I am glad to say that my hair
has now stopped falling, the dandruff has completely
been removed, and my hair has grown much thicker
and longer. My friends are astounded at the differ-
ence in my hair, so I have a splendid opportunity
of singing the praises of your wonderful preparation.

“Snell”: For a long time Holland could
not understand Partridge’s sudden enmity. They
were neighbors at Moon Hill, and, being cut off
from other society, had enjoyed each other’s for
several years. Then, Mrs. Partridge, being afflicted
with defective legs, her sister Kate was induced to
attach herself to the Partridge household as assist-
ant in the domestic department. Aunt Kate was a
widow, 88, and not lacking in personal charm.
Holland, who was a widower, took to her warmly,
and his visits to the Partridge homestead hecame
more frequent and protracted. But, some six
months later, Partridge began to cool off. Ilis cool-
ness developed sullen elements, and finally Holland
was given to see he wasn’t wanted. Partridge
lacked the courage to tell his neighbor to find sonic
other means of diversion than playing cheap euelire
m his back kitchen, but lie stuck up a notice at
their dividing fence, and the notice read: “Tres-
passers will he Persecuted—Specially Bill Holland.”
Holland thought it was a joke: hut when next he
called at Cartridge’s the dog was set on him, and
chancing round on the following Sunday afternoon,
he found Partridge waiting with a 'gun. A juvenile
Partridge conveyed due warning: “Dad sez if you
pass the pear-tree lie'll blow the leg offer yer.”
Holland went home, and pondered over the matter.
A few’ days later he met Partridge in at the town-
ship. “Look 'ere, Ned,” he said, “whas a-matter
with you. anyway?” “Oh, nothin’,” said Partridge.
But yuv druv me from yer ’ouse,” Holland per-
sisted, “ ’n’ 1 ivaS courtin’ Aunt Kate. This is most
import unt t’ me.” “Thut's it,” said Partridge
warming up. “I won’t have it. She’s me dis-
eased wife’s sister, V I won’t have it.” “But why
not, Ned ? ’ “She’s me diseased wife's sister I
tell yeh, ’n’ I won't have you bangin' round after
her.” “I dunno whateher mean, Ned.” “I mea u
what 1 say. She’s me diseased wife’s sister, ’n’ she’s
mine be law. The law sez a man marries his dis-
eased wife s sister, don’t it?” But Holland eloped
with Aunt Kate, and married her, and then for
years Partridge cherished a bitter grievance against
Holhmd. “The cow, he ran off with me diseased
wules sister! Ned would explain to strangers
adopting the tone of a Christian gentleman suffering
under a grievous wrong. Partridge died long before
his wife, but on his death-bed he gave strict orders.
Don t let that swine Holland come to me funeral,”
lie said. “The low thief, lie married me diseased
wife’s sister!”
THE SAME THING.
“Very wicked looking, eh!"
“Yes. Lovely!"
. Binglii has his own proper pride.
He was in the township for Christmas alonga boss.
A facetious crowd iiad him at the pub door. One
joker offered him a shilling, which he refused with
scorn; but when another offered a coin Iff l took it
gratefully. The first man pretended that he was
hurt. “Why you no take my money?” he said. Billy
looked him over with cold disgust. “That one bin
my friend,” he said. “I take it tshillin’ from him.
Him decent feller.”
HOIST BY HIS OWN PETARD.
ABRAHAM SOLOMON: “Say, Shakey, I got one in on that cheat of a chemist."
ISAAC REHOBOAM: “ How vos dot, uncle?"
ABRAHAM SOLOMON: "Vell, he sold me a bottle of anti-fat guaanleed to cure obesity
and I haff put on tree pounds weight in von veek. Dot ought to make ’im sit up.”
‘ Rag : TV lieu I travelled between “The
Cross” and Kalgoorlie the route was one long' ceine-
teiv of dead marines. I have never seen so many
or such a varied assortment of bottles. Portly,
plutoeiatie champagne holders lay alongside unpre-
tentious beer glassware; potent whisky vessels
nestled alongside ginger-beer coffins. Here and
there was a Worcester flask that had once provided
pick-me-ups. I took a special trip a couple of
years later to see if they were still there, and to
ascertain the extent of their injuries ; but an earlier
bird had swooped down and was building himself a
terrace of cottages out of the proceeds. For several
years everything in the way of provisions north of
“The Cross” that wasn’t poured out of a bottle was
lifted out of a tin, and many a hard-up fossieker
lound it more profitable to round up the übiquitous
metal empties than to pursue the elusive ’weight
When a stack of tins was collected they’d be heaped
on a sheet of iron over a fire, and you’d be sur-
prised at the size of the clean-up from a field where
a few hundred men have been camped.
"R.-N.”: The similarity in packing and
color between benzine and kerosene has been respon-
sible for a funeral in Papua. Cuba got a job as
deckhand on a motor-launch; and, seeing that the
oil was easily stealable, he filled several bottles and
passed them over the side to his wife in a canoe.
Ky-and-bye the illuminant was fed into the domestic
hurricane-lamp, and somebody struck a match. When
the startled neighbors jumped out of their huts to
see what the noise was they saw the grass humpy
of the Cuba family enveloped in fire and smoke.
Later on two nicely-grilled humans were found in
the debris. Cuba used fearful language about it,
because that wife had cost him the equivalent of
,VlO.
“Jimmy Woodser”: I’ve just given the
boss notice. I got the job a week ago turning the
winnower, and four days with a temperature of any-
thing up to 112 deg. settled me, especially as the
machine was in the middle of the paddock and half
a mile away from any shade. The boss almost wept
when I asked him for my cheque. “I’m sorry the
’cat’s erfected y’, but I ’ad to get someone in,” he
said. “V’ see. the missus .is down in Sydney, and
tld girls isn’t fit t’ turn it cos Bluey kicked Lil on

a norful boil on ’er arm. [Silent tears for 30 seconds.]

which have ceased to spring at all. Waipiro had
. some which, curiously enough, were situated on the
summit of a hill. Where they used to be the earth
is now reft and torn, as if it had been shelled by
the Kaiser’s siege guns, and uncharted water bubbles
up in other places. It looks as if the Devil’s boiler
had burst. In some parts of the Kaimanawa Moun-
tains I have seen holes which seem to penetrate to
the centre of gravity. Rocks thrown down them
nimble and rattle until they land on the roof of
Perdition. Henare asserts that these are old geysers
or blowholes, and were probably in active commis-
sion before history began to be an interesting liar.

Are massed behind the hills :
But with a joy as sharp as pain
The g'lad cicada shrills;
Silent, aloof, the houses stare
With g-lassv eyes too full of care.
A white gull undecided wheels
Against the guilty sky;
Alone at sea, it doubtless feels

That racket on through Nature’s hush.

Piano in Part Payment
for a Genuine Pianola.
The Steinway, StecK, Stroud

There is a piano in your home—a piano that is silent
ninety=nine evenings out of a hundred because you may not
have had time to acquire the technical ability to play it,
and because your repertoire has long since been exhausted.
Yet that piano - now little more than an article of furniture
—can be the very means of bringing the world’s wealth
of music to your home —music that is not limited by
mere inability to read the score or finger the notes.
AN OFFER You’ll Appreciate.
Tell us what your present piano is, and we will quote you a most
liberal allowance upon it to go towards the purchase of a genuine
Pianola. The balance can be paid on terms to suit your convenience,
and the Pianola can be in your home at once.
H Think of this —that long desired Pianola may be in your home
this very week — albyou need to do is to describe the Piano to us.
Even if your piano is an old one do not hesitate to write —the allow-
ance we .are prepared to make is a generous one, and there are many
of the new models of the Pianola which are comparatively
inexpensive. Priced as low as 120 Guineas. Fill up and post the
Coupon to-day. It is the first step towards the possession of a
genuine Pianola which everyone can play.


If You Need aTonic, You Need
the Best Tonic!
And the best tonic is Sanatogen ! That was
definitely proved by the official award of the Inter-
national Medical Congress, held in London in
August, 1913.
The special jury of the Congress, representing the
cleverest physicians in the world, gave their highest
possible award (the Grand Prix) to Sanatogen— and only
to Sanatogen —selecting it from all other tonics and
nutrients !
You Need Sanatogen
Do you fully grasp what this means
to you ? Where your health is con-
cerned, you cannot safely experiment
with inferior or doubtful preparations.
If you need a tonic, you need the best
tonic ? Therefore you need Sanatogen.
Sanatogen is the one tonic which
Commands your absolute confidence, be-
cause it has the confidence of the whole
medical profession. Over 19,000 signed
letters from practising physicians show
that Sanatogen is of the greatest value
in various conditions of ill-health, in-
cluding Nervous and Wasting Diseases,
General Weakness, Poverty of Blood, Im-
paired Digestion, and Faulty Nutrition.
Begin to take it To-day,
Sanatogen is the one thing
which you can depend on to bring
about a real improvement in your
health—and especially in the health of
your nervous system. Send this
coupon to-day for a Free Booklet,
which fully explains its nature
and uses.
You can buy Sanatogen a t any Chemist's, from 2/6d. per tin.

Sir FREDERICK MILNER,

says:—
“ Sir Frederick Milner was much
run down when he took Sanatogen,
and it certainly proved successful. It
seems both to nourish and give
strength. ’ ’
Madame SARAH GRAND,
authoress of “The Heavenly
Twins,” etc., writes :
“I pin my faith to Sanatogen
because it certainly restored me to
health after the worst nervous break-
down I ever had."
Mr. HENRY ARTHUR

writes: —
“ Sanatogen is a very valuable
food and nerve-tonic. I have several
times taken a course of it when run
down, and always with good results."

BRANDY MOON!
[For The Bulletin.]
We watched her come —a silent ghost;
As silent as the wind which drew
Her, vagabond from coast to coast.
We saw a lanthorn flash !—and knew |
We knew a dozen lusty hands
Had dropped the brown kegs overside,
A full green fathom to the sands ;
And now we wait the. ebbing tide 1
Then pass the flagon as we wait!
For never vigil need we keep;
The brandy moon it riseth late,
And the exciseman lies asleep.
The man is tired—tough heart o’ me!
His chin is muzzled on his coat!
His eyes are staring stupidly,
And lolls his tongue from out his throat.
Oh, hide his eyes beneath his hat!
An’ whose the hand did gaily deck
The still man with a red cravat
Which droppeth oddly at his neck?
Yet should we care who placed the thing
Which, like a blossom on his shirt,
Puts forth its tendril as a string
To bind the sleeper to the dirt?
He watched for her —the silent boat!
As silent as the hand which drew
The knife across his naked throat;
And he is silent, for he knew l
The tide is out, the kegs are bare;
Upriseth now the brandy moon ;
It leers upon he sleeper there,
And winks upon his buckled shoon.
And we can roll the slopping kegs
Over and up the muffled place;
And we can trip across his legs,
And crook our fingers at his face!
The brandy moon is slanting down ;
Yet in his gaudy new cravat
He mutely sits, a painted clown,
And stares and stares within his hat!

“R. 8.” : A\ T hat didn’t Germany make and
sell to the world? Most people regard the
U.S.A. as a self-contained country; but the
war deranged a lot of the trade even of
Unctuous Sam. The war should have given
him a tremendous profit in steel, by wiping
out the competition of German mills. In
1913 he made 30,000,000 tons, and used
250,000 tons of ferro-manganese in the mak-
ing—say a dollar’s worth of ferro-manganese
in a ton of steel. But this ferro-manganese
was brought from Europe; and with the
war the ferro-manganese which the U.S. had
to buy jumped from 38 dollars to 150 dollars
a ton. Iu the same way the cotton trade
should have sprinted because of the cutting-
off of the 25 million dollars of German cotton
goods annually imported. And so it would —
if the American cotton mills hadn’t been
dependent on Europe for their dyes. Ger-
many supplies the world with potash; hence
the U.S. manufacturers of fertiliser, glass and
soap, gunpowder and photographic potassium
cyanide have all been hampered. Beet-sugar
prices jumped with the war, and the U.S.
could produce much more than their 700,000
tons a year; but here was the nigger at that
woodheap—beet seed is imported from Ger-
many. American cane-sugar planters got
better prices; but were struck heavily with
higher prices for imported jute bags. ' As to
potash, by the way, big lots of bull kelp
come ashore along the Tasmanian west coast
at every blow; and there should be a new
industry waiting there for a few good men
with a lot of energy and a little money.
*****
Contrary to general expectation, the Labor
party in the Vic. Assembly attacked the Gov-
ernment over the Maffra beet-sugar mill.
Last year Premier AVatt determined to close
it down. The Argus, with one eye on its fat
friend, the C.S.IL Co., supported him, but
the Age fiercely opposed. He gave way, and
decided on another year’s trial. That year
has shown a deficit of £lO,OOO. The mill
cost £BO,OOO, and in one way and another is
said to have run away with £200,000. The
Laborites said the experiment had gone far
enough, and failure ought to be admitted.
However, the Government represented that
the loss for next year is estimated at only
£5000; and as the mill has more offers from
farmers to grow beet than ever before, the
establishment is to have one year more of
grace.
❖ * * *
“B.B.”: Defence Minister Pearce’s state-
ment regarding the news censorship reads as
though nobody but his own Department had
any cause to complain about anything. If
the censorship stopped at doing the things
he mentions, and did those things intell-
gently, the Department would earn our grati-
tude and nothing else ; but—well, here’s one
case: AVhen a certain non-combatant ship
was leaving Brisbane I took a panoramic
view, which commanded a ready sale. Both
the Courier and Telegraph published
photos, of the vessel leaving port. One week
later, when I was working at factory speed
to supply orders, the censor shut down and
gave orders that no more photos, were to be
published. This after the two dailies had
scattered something like 00.000 copies ! One
of the photos, had been nosted to the captain
of the vessel at Melbourne, but only the
addressed covering was delivered. This held
a note stating that the censor was holding
the contents. The skipper promptly had a
heart-to-heart talk with somebody. He got
the picture.
* * * *
N.S.AV. Judge Murray handed out a Christ-
mas box to the sliyndicates that have been
cutting up N. S. AA r ales estates and don’t
want to pay income-tax on the profits. The
Department billed them, of course, and a
test case was heard at great length just before
the holidays. The syndicator pleaded that
he was merely converting his capital. But
the hard-headed old Judge with the mathe-
matical mind probably observed that the
syndicator was busy converting land for
which he had paid 20s. into coin worth 40s.
anywhere; and he decided, apparently, that
the extra 20s. was plain profit and therefore
taxable as income. Anyhow, he said that the
syndicators were taxable, though the Depart-
ment’s basis of assessment was wrong. The
law, as indicated by the Court, seems to be
that the difference between cost and sale
price is taxable as income derived from per-
sonal exertion —that is, it is taxable on the
lower scale. Even that leaves a lot to
wrangle over; because the profit on a time-
payment bargain, which may never be com-
pleted, is a horribly uncertain quantity. And
that’s how it is with most land subdivisions.
* * * *
“F.C.”: As a consequence of the altitudi-
nous price of wheat, and the shortage of
bran and pollard, the poultry breeders of
Australia are being introduced to blue ruin.
Nevertheless, the Vic. Agricultural Depart-
ment continues its quaint egg-laying com-
petition at Burnley, while the breeders sup-
plicate the Minister for means to merely
keep the chooks alive. The supplicants don’t
seem to have noticed that they are pouring-
more contumely on the poor old law of
supply and demand —-or the ruins of it.
According to this “law,” fowl fodder being
scarce and dear, the price of birds should
rise. But it doesn’t. In fact, so
many people want to Sell fowls that
they are ridiculously cheap. Also with
pollard doubled in price, eggs should
simultaneously have leaped from Is. per
dozen to 2s. or thereabouts; yet they
are but Is. 4d. or so. The situation is in-
volved, not to say mixed ; and it is further
complicated by the Victorian Minister’s
latest announcement that he will provide,
from the State’s seed wheat supplies, some
5000 hags for the consumption of birds of
approved breeding. Out of the whirl of
things only two points are definite: (1)
these are sad times for fowls whose parents
were no better than they should have been ;
(2) fowl-raising is a game for fools. When
it costs a lot to keep fowls, they are cheap,
because everybody wants to sell them. When
it costs little to keep them, they are also
cheap because then every second suburban
yard is a chicken hatchery and the market
is glutted before you can look round and
sell out to some bigger fool than yourself.
“D.” : The war is humping a lot of bur-
dens. Last week I ordered some mosquito
curtains. The counter-leaper swore they
would be at my house on Wednesday. On
Friday I called and asked why they weren’t.
“It is true they have not gone,” he said, with
an air of assurance unusual in the circum-
stances. “What I want to know is why
they haven’t,” I answered heatedly. “They
will not arrive till to-morrow,” he intoned,
as though it was something to be proud of.
I was on the point of bursting when he said :
“We have had a Government order m the
same line, lours has been held over in the
interests of Patriotism!” As he stood
there, with the evening sun glistening upon
the crossed Union Jacks on his horrible tie,
it was plain that he realised he had me.
For the first time, perhaps, in liis sinful
life he had a really sound excuse for exas-
perating ailatoriness. Dumbly I crawled off,
routed.
Her Majesty the Cow is consuming more
timber than you might think. The Egmont
rsox Co. in Maoriland was started 11 years
ago with the object of making white-pine
butter and cheese boxes for the dairy fac-
tories of northern Taranaki, and now caters
for the whole of the North Island. The men
on the pay-roll run into hundreds, and last
year they turned out two million butter
boxes and a quarter of a million cheese
crates. As the co.’s operations expanded it
went into the timber-milling business to
supply itself with white pine, and it now owns
three, big sawmills on the Main Trunk line,
and reckons that it controls sufficient stand-
ing bush of the needed variety to keep it
going for 25 years
* - *- * *
“Bloggs” : The working fisherman de-
serves to be as stone-broke as he mostly is. He
is so very languid. This befel me the other
Sunday. Approaching an insanitary-looking
vendor, who dozed by his basket, I asked the
price of some red bream. “Theseyer,” and
he held up a couple of half-pounders, “is
small schnapper— say a bob each.” I was
disinclined to say a bob for fish which I
could have bought in the city for 50 per
cent. less. He held up a little kingfish.
“ ’Ow about a bob fer this?” he enquired
languidly. I decided on the bream and said
I would have them if he got them cleaned.
He sat back stunned. “Clean ’em!” he
wailed. “Clean ’em ! I couldn’t do it not if
yer give me a quid.” And yet the South
Pacific was at his disposal and within a
few yards. The fisherman explains that the
middleman is his chief bane. But I think
in the case of many it is weariness combined
with beer; and of these two the greater is
weariness, since even beer is often sacri-
ficed upon the altar of it.
THE VEILED LADIES OF THE SEA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Like a veiled lady down a corridor
She glides with lamp held high;
Her garments make a rustling on the floor
As she sweeps proudly by.
A moment’s pause at the wide ocean gate
Where waits the open sea;
Then, sweet and proud, to brave and meet her fate,
She swims out gallantly.
O Shadow Ladies, reticent and quick—
A rustle and you’re gone!
And I with curiosity am sick!
What job is it you’re on?
Ah! one would never guess from your grand airs
The humble errands you
Run for the city of a million snares,
For quite a humble screw.
You are a humble housemaid bringing coals!
And you a dairymaid 1
And yet—and yet the pair of you have souls,
Although begrimed with trade.
Like a veiled woman down a corridor
She goes on her employ,
To bring some food or fuel from the store —
The Ocean is her boy.

It seems probable that before Easter the
Australian Light Horse may be chasing
lurks and their German keepers round the
holy places of Palestine. Very few people
ever succeeded in actually invading Egypt
from Asia. The fights of the Pharaohs and
1 tolemies generally happened in Palestine
or further up in Syria. History is evi-
dently calling an encore, and the Turkish
forces, with German bosses, which are sup-
posed to threaten the Sphinx will probably
be smashed near Jerusalem (if they wait)
and near Damascus (if they run away).
John Louis Trefle, N.S.W. Minister for
Lands, who died on Monday, was a victim
to the bad habit of writing a minute with
one hand and eating a bun with the other,
lie came into the McGowen Government as
Hon. Minister. Donald Macdonell was
Minister of Agriculture, among other things.
Irene did his sick colleague’s work; and
when Beeby left the Lands Department he
doubled ’the parts. He kept this going from
JJl_ until Ashford relieved him in the Agri-
culture branch just 12 months ago. Over-
eating, Trefle believed, was the cause of
most mental dullness. He had almost a
mama for keeping fit himself—fitness for him
meaning leanness and alertness. It may have
been a good thing for his brain ; it was no
good for his body. Influenza caught him.

to take two months’ spell. A month ago he
returned “quite well.” Then appendicitis
found him. and in four days he was dead.
ALMOST INCREDIBLE.

THE MAN WITH THE AXE: "What, and do
me out of firewood?"
ihe rise in the price of meat keeps the
Australian Parliament in a state of fever,
and Minister Tudor is bombarded with ques-
tions as to whether he intends to prohibit
exports, and thus increase the local supply.
But while this low-tariff country continues
to import ships, dredges, clothes, millinery,
picture hats, boots, locomotives, drain pipes,
ironware, and a thousand other things, to
the destruction of local industry, it must
export something to pay for them. And
meat is a handy thing to send away, even
if the export makes the local supply so short
that steak costs 2s. 6d. per lb.
The War has shown un the shameless lack
of patriotism of many public departments.
One of the worst offenders is the Yic. Rail-
ways, which last month gazetted a long list
of contracts entered into just before the War
for supplies of German and other foreign
goods. These include enamelled mugs, car-
penters’ braces, bits, lifting jacks, jack-
planes, mild angle steel, round or square
steel, shafting, fencing wire, brass wire and
gold leaf to the value of thousands of pounds.
Many of the articles are produced in the
Commonwealth; all of them are made in
Britain. Yet the Commissioners passed the
Australian and British goods by and rushed
the German rubbish. Their sole excuse is
that the rubbish is cheap; and to make their
employers richer by 21 d. they first make
them poorer by half a crown. In such cir-
cumstances it seems about time the Vic-
torian Parliament saw that its instructions
re, preference to Australian and British goods •
were carried out'.

x - s ' w - . THE PANTRYMAN.
The costliness of modern methods of
national assault and battery can be judged
by the fact that the whole Crimean war
cost Great Britain directly £70,000,000,
which would be only enough to carry the
country through between eight and nine
weeks of the present campaign. Like every
other scrimmage, the 60-year-old Crimean
allair was going to last only a few weeks,
and the probable bill for the entire unplea-
santness was mentioned in a light and airy
fashion as £10,000,000. It actually lasted
about two years, and cost seven times the
estimate. The S’African business, which
was going to take about as long as Mrs.

£635,000,000 to £798,000,000. But then,
having an idea that some day the nation
would be in more trouble, and probably sus-
pecting that just then Australian loafing
politicians would demand assistance in order
to pay Bill (one vote) higher wages than
a “y other Bill gets, Britain started to wipe
off the debt. And this is how the two have
shaped since then :—

So Britain, at whose poverty Australia
makes ribald remarks, has' paid off
£91,000,000 in the 11 years, while Australia,
the great, rich loafer, lias gone £98,000.000

Melbourne’s Metro-
politan Board of
►j lurks is applying
to Premier Peacock
for power to arm
itself against The
Bulletin in parti-
cular and an un-
friendly press in
general. Under exist-
ing conditions, the
Board cannot bring
any legal guns into
libel action. The
Commissioners can
individually blaze
away, but are not
disposed to find the
means to do it. Pea-
cock is therefore
earnestly requested
to “bring before Cab-
inet the question of
amending the law of
libel so that legal
proceedings may be
I aken by corpora-
tions against news-
papers which pub-
lish slanders against
them.” The Bulle-
tin trusts that Pea-
cock will go even
further. It trusts
that corporations
may not only sue,
but be also sued
for • slander —which
seems merely a fair
thing. And it trusts
that not only a cor-
poration but any
well-defined entity
may sue. Then when
(say) a Board of
Works slanders a
country by giving
work to a foreigner
on the ground that
the Australian can’t
do it as well, the
Commonwealth Gov-
ernment will be en-
titled to fire in a
writ and ask for
damages from the
Board for holding lie country’s resources
up to contempt.

in Paraguay, where an ex-Minister for War
rose up. and, after a fight between rebels
and police, imprisoned the President and
proclaimed himself. The only reason for
the brief and hurried transaction was, appar-
ently, that the new President was out of a
job. The day following he was out of a
job again; for another constable or two
dropped in from somewhere, and the brief
episode ended in the new President bolting
for Argentina.

THE QUIET TIEDES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The quiet tides slip dumbly out
Between the moleheads grey
To join the revel and the rout
Of open seas that gaily shout
And roughly ride away.
Anon, the slow tides turn about,
And, swimming, flood the bay—
the big guns on the steep hillsides
Keep watch and ward above the tides.
No hulls ride on the moon-tides dim
For those high guns to find.
But deep and slow, war-monsters swim ;
Just moving at the flood-tide’s whim
Like sea-beasts deaf and blind.
And when the dawn gilds ocean’s rim,
Urged by a master mind,
They’ll seek the battleships that dream
Below the big guns’ watchful gleam.
Above the tide, a stalk-like eye
Lifts clear and dips again.
And others follow, drifting by,
For each must, at a hazard, try
To lay a course; and then
Sink back with scarce a surge or sigh
Till comes the moment when,
Lre yet the full tide turns and runs,
The submarines must dare the guns.
Between the moles the lazy tide
Goes gurgling in the gloom,
And in its deeps, Cyclopean-eyed,
The submarines in silence glide—
The silence of the tomb.
Faint, in the cast, the dawn-lights ride,
And, past the harbor boom,
Beneath the guns the flood-tide swims
Muttering prayers and crooning hymns.
Like hounds at gaze the hard-lipped guns
Watch far and wide and near ;
And from the grey tide, as it runs,
As silently as hooded nuns
Those monster eyes lift clear,
Pale as sea-eyes unused to suns—
And then the sunk hulls veer,
To make the last swift rush before
The dreadful guns shall flame and roar.
But, ere the foremost submarine
Can leap towards the ships,
An angry flame of red leaps clean,
And comes the crash of cordite keen,
From lean and leering lips.
Like stalks of corn that women glean
Bach monster’s fell eye dips
Into the tide that gurgles on—
The ebb-tide on its seaward run.
The quiet tide slips dumbly out
Between the moleheads grey.
It shuns the revel and the rout
Of open seas that bravely shout
And thunder on their way.
For, as it ran, it swirled about
A shattered hull that lay
The grim yuns on the steep hillsides
Keep watch and ward above the tides f

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The second scrap between N. S. Wales
and South Aus. over the Sheffield Shield was mostly
a dull and dreary business, punctuated by spell-olis
on account of rain. A day’s play was got through
on Friday and a day's loaf on Saturday; another
day was spent in the field on Monday, and there was
more knock-off on Tuesday. Tarpaulins (which were
not used in Adelaide) had been agreed upon for the
match at Sydney, but because there was too little
tarpaulin the pitch was not preserved. In fact, its
name was Mud on Saturday 7. Bardsley’s big score of
if)3 for the home team was the result of mixed bat-
ting. It would have been less mixed if he had been
sent home on two chances early in his career. As
the games go, it looks all over bar hurraying that
Ma will not have to take the Shield down from its
old place on the wall.

Clem Hill, in Adelaide, has promptly dis-
claimed Mayne’s suggestion, made in a Sydney speech,
that he (Hill) considers “Adelaide crowds the worst
judges of cricket in the world.” “The very last
thing I would say,” Hill told an interviewer. And
certainly it would be an odd return to make for 20
years of consistent adoration.
* * * *
H. Ironmonger, who trundled with the
strength of Samson against South Aus., left Queens-
land last year to take a job with the Melbourne
Cricket Club. It. is Ironmonger’s first season in
Sheffield Shield cricket, and in two matches (v.
N§S.W. and South Aus.) he has made a healthy start
by taking 18 wickets for 272 runs. Only one other
bowler lias this season bagged more than 10 wickets
—R. B. Minnett (13 for IS7). Being a left-hander,
Ironmonger is likely to stay in the eye of the Aus-
tralian selection committee.
■56- * * *
R. B. Minnett (N.S.W.), who spread-
eagled 10 wickets for 81 in the match v. Victoria,
is a limb of a sturdy family which takes cricket
and baseball with its meals. lie was in the 1913
Australian XI. The climate of Bull’s Land knocked
the colt askew. In this season’s Sydney grade cricket
Minnett is fourth on the batting list with an average
of 55 per innings, but is not among the first 10
bowlers. Obviously he was chosen for batting, but
other talents obtruded, and he shone where unex-
pected. Providing Minnett can get rid of the “no-
ball” habit, he looks like being a useful help to Ma
in future matches.

Three colts stand out promisingly in Aus-
tralian cricket this season. R. L. Park (Vic.), who
scored 163 in two innings v. S. Aus. ; Don M. Steele
(S. Aus.), 192 in four innings v. N.S.W. and Vie.;
and C. E. Pellew (S. Aus.) 128 in four innings v.
N.S.W. and Vic. Park (134), Steele (100) and
Bardsley (103) are the only century-makers thus
# far in this Sheffield Shield round.

Tasmania had its annual North v. South
cricket match recently at Hobart. As usual, it was
a hollow win for the southerners, who (after closing
their innings at 302 for six wickets) routed the
North for 68 and 179, and won by an innings and
55 runs.
The usual scrimmage between barrackers
at the St. Peter’s v. Prince Alfred college match, in
Adelaide, brought both schools a severe lecture from
Governor Galway at their Speech days, which imme-
diately followed. He regards it as ungentlemanly
and not “playing the game,” and many parents have
endorsed his comments. A difference of opinion
exists however, many Old Blues and Old Reds claim-
ing that the mild scrimmage is a natural exhibition
of boyish spirit and a proper display of loyalty,
and that to interfere is old-maidish, or worse.
* * * *
There has been some interesting minor
cricket in Adelaide, where an attempt is being' made
to find new talent. Several country (matting) players
were much boomed, so three teams were got together
and pitted against as many from the city, with the
inter-State men left out ; after which the pick of
North and South played each other, and then Coun-
try played City. The new discoveries were of some
promise, but, as often happens, those who failed
under the new conditions are declared by those who'
know them to be among the very best when at home.
These have gone' back to their more-or-less rural
retreats demanding turf wickets there also; and, as
Adelaide this year has shown how to maintain all its
grass on bore-water solely, the turf-pitch may shortly
be forthcoming in all kinds of unexpected places.
Meanwhile, S.A. colts played a team from Victoria,
and got badly beaten. Old Jack AVorrall, who was
oyer with the Melbourne lads, attributed the Adel-
aide failure to lack of enterprise, especially foot-
work, in playing break bowling. The home side was
inclined to credit the veteran himself with a big
share in the win, his coaching being unfailing and
far superior to anything the Adelaide youngsters have
had since Crawford left.
Kahanamoku is a great sprinter, but he
doesn’t stayy On the second day of the Sydney
meeting Adrian, the Manly long-distance crack, beat
him in the 440yds. Chamoionship race, and on the
evidence he would do it again. The Hawaiian swam
superbly for three laps, and then the ginger seemed
to go out of his work. Adrian went away from him
at the final turn, and, though the white lad lost
time by looking round to see how things were, his
adversary* could do nothing with him. Adrian won
by a couple of feet after a tremendous finish.
At the: third and final splash on Saturday the
draw waS the 220yds. handicap. Healy, Hardwick
and Long-worth were non-starters. The first two
gave no reason why they preferred dry land. Long-
worth was suffering from something unspecified. The
race was;as uninteresting as a temperance meeting.
“The Duke” paddled himself well ahead of the field
in the first lap, but, when 20yds. off the post, began
to make very heavy weather, and it looked as though
Page and Cunha would catch him. Cunlia’s steering-
gear went wrong and put him out of his course. The
gap was too much for Page, and the very much
knocked-up Hawaiian won by a little over a length.
Time, 2min. 32 2-ssee., four seconds slower than
Kieran’s record. The idea that Kalianamoku could
have won the 440 the previous Wednesday may now
be thrown overboard. He made it fairiy clear on
Saturday that he can only keep up his wonderful
pace for a sprint distance. The result of the race
might have been different had Healy and Longworth
not been suffering from their unspecified troubles.
One variety of patriot wrote to the
papers the other day: “The boxers surely ought to
be in the first line. This ever-increasing • and abso-
solutely useless section of the community should be
given an opportunity to give full vent to their fight-
ing propensities, and, if a little gentle pressure were
brought to bear, it is just possible some of them, the
more daring ones, might be induced to volunteer for
foreign service.” According to W. W. Hill, of the
N.S.W. Rugby Union, 18 front-rank Australian
boxers are already in the firing-line; while of the
top-notchers who remain, Jeff Smith. Frank Tough -
rev, Pat Bradley, Jimmy Fitton and manv others
are ineligible, being Yankees. Now, how about the
Young Men’s Bible Class that the above-mentioned
patriots probably conducts? How many of that little
lot have gone to the front?

At 8.30 p.m. Frank Loughrey, of the
U.S. arose briskly from his corner in the Sydnev
Stadium, made the sign of the cross, and hurled
himself like a ton of coal'upon Mick King. He
maintained the illusion that he weighed a ton or
more right through the battle, though, in point of
fact, the weights were —Loughrey, lOst. Silb. ; King,
list. 41b. Loughrey’s method is to pile "himself on
to the enemy and wear the latter down by sheer
strength and punching vigor. This succeeded with
Pat Bradley, who is that sort of fighter
himself and was taken by surprise
when his own patent was employed
against him. The scheme proved of little
value against King, whose speed and
skill removed him from the danger zone,
as often as it approached. Loughrey liac'
only one guard for the Australian’s
straight left —his nose; and he stopped
roughly, half a dozen right-crosses with
his jaw in every round. At no time,
however, did King’s punches appear to
hurt. On the other hand, at one time in
the sixth round, Loughrey had the local
man in a bad way for a few seconds. To
balance this the game little Irish-Ameri-
can was all out, and utterly incapable
of knocking anyone in the last two
rounds. His own exertions and King's
constant attention to his jaw had damped
his ardor. The decision—-a draw—was a
notable example of the efficacy of prayer.
King won by yards. If proof were
needed that the referee had erred griev-
ously it was supplied by Loughrey’s
corner. A 1 Lippe and Jeff' Smith were
too delighted for articulate speech for a moment,
and then they loudly proclaimed that the
verdict was a fine one. When a Yankee corner
applauds a draw it is a sure sign that it has been
regarding its man as doomed for rounds past.

Jerry Jerome was given a points’ verdict
over Arthur Evernden at Brisbane Stadium on Satur-
day night. Jerry fought in his usual wild, eare-free
fashion and with his customary allowance of
stomach. The Northern crowd —in fact, every
crowd-dikes Jerry and his flamboyant methods, but
there was annoyance, loudly and frankly expressed,
at his latest victory. In the opinion of the audi-
ence, the abo. got well licked.

It is reported that Jack Johnson will fight
Jesse Willard a 45-rounds contest for the world's
heavyweight title at Juarez, in Mexico. A promoter
once conceived the idea of evading the national re-
pugnance to Johnson by staging a contest, in which
he was to be a principal, aboard a specially-char-
tered liner. The tickets were to cost £25 apiece,
and the fight was to occur on the first calm day.
Juarez is evidently the alternative to the liner busi-
ness. But will the Yanks travel to an insanitary
Mexican village to see a scramble between a third-
rate white boxer and an elderly nigger who is
admittedly, only back at the game because he is
broke? It seems unlikelv : and if the Yanks don’t
pay to see the riot it is certain no one else will.

Entries for the big Autumn handicaps in-

flat-racing booms only in the spring, and hurdles

The Newmarket Handicap has 99 entrants as against
145 for the Doncaster at Randwiek. The old Aus-
tralian Cup has 59, whilst the Sydney Cup—which
certainly is much better worth winning—has an entry
of 102. All the same, the booking for the two prin-
cipal gambles of the V.R.C. meet, beginning on
February 27, are rather above the average for the
last 10 years; and the winner will probablv want a
lot of picking in both cases.

Mistico, winner of the recent W.A. Derby,
was bred in the prolific Hawkesburv district
(N.S.W.), by J. R. Ilardie, and was purchased as a
yearling for 100 guineas by D. E. Grant. The colt
is by Linacre (imp.) from Grey Mist (imp.).
Victoria gradually comes to the front as a
breeding-ground of good winners. liingsburgh
(Melb. Cup) is a notable instance. More recently
the lOOOsov. Karrakatta Plate for 2-year-olds, run at
the W.A.T.C. meeting, was annexed by a Victorian-
bred filly, Welkin Queen, by The Welkin from
Wilga. The filly was bred by E. E. D. Clarke, who
imported her sire and dam. She was sold as a year-
ling to M. Muleahy for 530 guineas.

Jockeys G. York and F. Moore were hurt
bv a boomerang at the recent Tatt.’s meeting at
Randwiek.. York (on Compromise) and Moore (on
Louis Brook) protested on the grounds of interfer-
ence by Moon (rider of King Lucre) : but the
stewards, after consideration, dismissed the protest.
Then they went deeper into the mystery, and fin-
ished nip by calling York and Moore before them and
presenting each of them with a two years’ dis-
qualification for collusion.
Something approaching the limit in dis-
qualifications was seen at the Mount Gambier (S.A.)
Caledonian sports on New Year’s Day. In the
Novices’ Mile the second man home protested that
the first had won a race previously, and proved it.
Before he could collect, however, the third man
made a similar charge against the second man, and
proved that, too. This seemed like the end; but a
fourth had been placed by the judges, and he sus-
tained a similar protest against the third, and so
took first prize. No others were awarded.

“Snaffle” : It is recorded that the cavalry
horses from Australia and India reached Egypt and
France in wonderful condition. For this we owe a
debt to Teddy Weeks and his successors in the ship-
ping of Australian horses to India. They carried the
science of transport to the acme. Teddy began,
without a bean, as a knockabut boy in Kirk’s
Bazaar, Melbourne. He had a screwy' nose of the
sort that seems to go with ginger. As lie prospered
he became hail-fellow-well-met with viceroys, com-
manders-in-chief and other nobs. Lord Aylesford
even wanted to fight him. “Oh, no, me lud!” said
Teddy, although he could have smote the lord over
the horizon.
Newspaper tipping isn’t what it used to
be in Maoriland, owing to interfering legislation.
Mick King keeps his tummy out of Loughrey's
way (Sydney Stadium).
Once the first, second and third horses would be
tipped straight out. Now the horse reporter does
it this way: “For the handicap at Orepuki to-
morrow Cantrun will have a large army of sup-
porters, but the claims of Droptdcad should not be
overlooked. He ran well in the Notlianks Stakes
at Waipukurau last week, and will probably win if
he can beat the field. Of course, there are the
claims of Tiki, Nogood, Te Wliare and Lovealot to
be considered, and any of them might land the
money. It is not expected, however, that more
than one of them can win. Tommyrot’s chances
should not be despised, and the same remarks apply
to Te Bacon. Many people also fancy Wairakei,
while Wakatipu will certainly get a place if ho
gets closer up than first.” You can get all that
information for a penny any day.
A somewhat unusual shipment of horses
has just arrived in Australia from the Cold Country.
The original consignment numbered 22, but two or
three died on the vovage. Some of the survivors
were landed in W.A., and the rest, barring nine for
Sydney, at Melbourne. The oldest of the lot is
Cyklon, a 5-year-old horse by Carbine’s son, Spear-
mint, from Cyranean. He was being trained in Eng-
land for his owners, the German Imperial stud, of
Graditz, Prussia, when the British Government seized
and sold him. Cyklon was consigned to F. 11. Lewis,
of Victoria, who, after escorting’ him from W.A.,
was unable to land at Melbourne for the time being’
owing to small-pox on board the ship. Four wins in
eights starts is Cyklon’s record, and he is expected to
shake a profitable leg’ in the best Australian com-
pany. Two other compulsorily-sold animals in the
shipment are the 2-year-old colt. Longbardo (Caius —•
Lockung), from the German Imperial stud: and
Aides, a 5-year-old horse by Kilcock from Ivad, and
recently the property of Baron Stringer, of Austria.
Those consigned to N.S.W. owners are Quarrender,
4-year-old horse by Mountain Apple-llackler mare;
Hecate, 3-year-old filly by Radium —Galinthia ; Clus-
ter, 3-year-old colt by Ian —Star Diamond ; Donore,
4-year-old horse by William the Third—Abovnc:
Ladies’ Day, 2-year-old filly, by Wuffv from Geof-
fros; Princess Patricia, 2-year-old filly by Long Tom
—White Collar ; The Belgian, 2-year-old colt by Car-
pathian—Nutbloom ; Munificent, 2-year-old colt by
Marcovil—Lady Bountiful; and an unnamed 3-vear-
old colt by Symington from Veneration IT., dam of
Craganour, who was disqualified for the English
Derby a: few years ago. Two of the shipment, Eileen
More, 3-year-old filly, and Irish--Buck. 3-year-old
colt, are out of Lauda and Duckshot, respectively,
while the dad of both is Earla Mor, sire of the
imported Dollar Dictator, winner of the recent Perth
Cup (W. A.). The whole consignment was brought
out by .Tames Bullock, father of the jock, who
flogged Blue Spec home in a Melbourne Cup
N.S.W. purchases include J. G. Barry, who takes
Donore, Lady’s Day, Munificent, Princess Patricia
and The Belgian; D. U. Seaton, a well-known Syd-
ney owner’; and Mrs. W. H. Dean, for whom Tauliter
has at last begun to win races.

In a 100 yards scratch race, the other day.
Sydney schoolboy champion Hansel downed four of
the best Ma State fliers in 10 1-5 secs.——2 vards worse
than “evens.” On the same day, Hansel was beaten
by a,yard in the 120 yards handicap in 12 l-10sec.
—only one yard “worse.” Both efforts were so'good
that Hahsel looks like having a say in-the division
of the spoil at the N.S.W. Amateur Athletic cham-
pionships on March 6 and 13 at Ashfield.
N.S.W. Cyclists’ Union has decided to «o
! 1 w Btatl i championship carnival on March
13 and 16. lour championships will be interspersed
with handicaps—half, one, five and 10 miles—an
already inter-State bodies are intimating that rens
will be sent forward to whirl for the honor the
glory and the medals. ’ e
The shindykit behind the recent 48 hours'
cycling whizz at Sydney didn’t reap where it had
sowed, and the “gate” was not sufficient to meet the
expenses bill. However, the co. is to try again in
Brisbane in February, when a bunch of inter-State
riders will go north to join in a six days’ rush.

There’s money on the cycle track still,
particularly in the United States, where £20,000
was paid out during last racing season. Australia’s
speed dealer, A. Goullet, headed the winning list
with £l5OO or thereabouts (exclusive of appearance
money, bonuses, etc.). Grenda, of Tassy, got away
with something like £750 in prizes aione. A. ,j.
Clark, another of our boys, started with a retaining
fee of £500; so, though his prize money was not
as bulky as usual, his swag was very comfortable.
Go on the track, young mail.
Sydney jockey W. H. McLachlan is a
glutton for “cups.” The recent victory in A.. 1.0
Summer Cup lifted his record list to: Willi a ms-
town Cup (three), Summer Cup (three), Melbourne,
Sydney and Moonee Valley Cups (two each), Caul-
field, Australian, Adelaide, Brisbane, Tattersall's and
Newcastle Cups (one each).
Tom Walsh, one of the best-known pony
pilots on the Sydney Associated Racing Clubs’ tracks,
has hung up the saddle and the whip, and will try
his cunning hand at training. Walsh in the last five
rears has won 286 races, with 214 seconds and 161
thirds.

Herbert Maitland, the Sydney surgeon who
has just got a knighthood, is a shade over 40, short,
straight-featured, prematurely grey and extremely
powerful. He has the modern medico’s passion for
keeping fit. To that end he works almost as hard at
sports of various kinds as he does at his profession.
Tie is his State’s best-known fisherman. He has
caught trout all over the Monaro district, and pur-
sued deep-sea fish from one end of the coast to the
other; lie was one of the inaugurators of the now
flourishing pastime of tunny-fishing-; and he is the
champion fly-caster of N. S. Wales. He was an
inter-State footballer, and is still a sound boxer and
a regular patron of the Sydney Stadium.
William Webb, of Maoriland, who was the
comet of a season .when he won the world’s rowing
championship, is challenged now to defend his local
title. The Wanganui River, whereon William lives,
is to be the course, £2OO a-side the inducement, and
any day before April 30 the time.

The abandonment of the Easter bowlipg

trundlers. Over 100 nominations had been received
for the representative - team ,tQ f jnal>e the trip across,

their Olytiitmas greetings ..to Maoriland bowlers an
invitation “to send along a team, which doesn’t look
as if the hobnailed boots of Hoggenzollern are ex-
pected to tear up the lawns of Britain just yet.
All the same, if they’ve got money to burn they’d
better pass it on to the War Office with the remark
that it. can be used to pay the passages of a team of

The annual tourney of the Maoriland

“Hugh Stone” : Now that the conference
between the N.S.W. Rugby Lea gue and Australian
Rules footballers has taken place and there is an
indication that in 1915 there are to be exhibition
games of the hybrid code —which one presumes will
also bear the name Australian—l want to draw
attention to the illegality of such proceedings.
According to the constitution of the Australian Foot-
ball Council—the governing body of Australian Rules
Football—it (the council) alone has the power to
make _ alterations in the game. No section of the
council has this power. The council as a whole meets
only at carnival time—every three years. During the
discussion on the proposed conference at the last
meeting the. committee was given no power to
arrange “exhibition” fixtures. The proper course for
the committee is to report to the council, and that
body, when it meets in Melbourne in 1917. has the
right to say whether there the exhibition games of
the mongrel code shall be fielded.
England has decided not to challenge Aus-
tralasia for the Davis Cup, mostly because its cracks
are in the trenches. /Australasia, Belgium and France
are similarly situated; and two of Germany’s team
‘JJ’ e P , l ’’ ollel ' s of war.: They are all trying to believe
that Uncle Sam s players are sports enough not to
issue a challenge while the other nations are thus
handicapped. There remain six weeks in which Sam
may destroy these hopes by issuing a challenge.

Sydney riflemen displayed excellent shoot-
ing at the opening of, Randwick (Sydney) “first 1915
quarter on Saturday. Twenty clubs were allotted
target space, and, despite showery conditions, the
averages were above the ordinary.' At 500.vds. 19
members of Sydney Club averaged 63 out of a possi-
ble (0 points; and at a similar distance 36 Parra-
mattans came out with a shade over 60 per member.
At 800yds. 28 of the Tramway Club evened 41 out
ot a possible 50 ; while at the long ranges of 800yds.
and 900yds. J. Beverley and G. Linport (N. Sydney)
each plugged a creditable score of 61 out of a possi-
3]e '. l - Altogether the enthusiasm and proficiency
ot riflemen at the mounds is something worth
enthusing over. V


Why You Need My
Health Exercises!
Because they are a natural stimulant for
replacing' the waste tissue of your system.
Every effort you make destroys energy,
creating tissue in proportion to the exertion
involved. . .
This process is going on every minute or
the day, and unless you exercise judiciously,
the accumulation of waste tissue will debili-
tate your system.
Of course, you may not notice the differ-
ence. It is so gradual. But it certainly
exists. It is ever increasing, and always
undermining your energy—your health.
By performing a few simple, yet scientific,
exercises, such as those comprising the
Baker Course of Health Exercises
you immediately expel the worn-out tissue,
and create new tissue to take its place.
These HEALTH EXERCISES are extremely
beneficial. They are very thorough. They
ensure a copious, virile blood circulation.
And a strong blood circulation means the
nourishing and strengthening of all the thews,
sinews, nerve cells, etc., of your body.
Read the convincing proofs given in these
letters: — .
“Your Exercises have been very satis-
factory indeed, doing much more for me
than I anticipated. I feel finite a dif-
ferent person.” “ ,' r
—L.J.H., Tabulam (N.S.YV.).
“My muscles are harder, and my
chest, back and limbs much stronger. I
think it is impossible to over-estimate
the value of these exercises, and I will
recommend them to ah my friends.’

The Windeyers (,B. 7/1/15) are not the
only old Sydney legal family with many
representatives at the front. lour of the
Dowlings, grandsons of Judge Dowling and
great-grandsons of the second Chief Justice
of N S Wales, are in the unpleasantness.
Two'are sons of Arthur Dowling, solicitor
and president of the Public Library Trus-
tees ; the other two are sons of Seville
Dowling. , ,
The cable tells us that three_ grandsons
of the famous Garibaldi, sons ot Kicciotti,
are fighting with the Allies. They are
French subjects, although it was a terrible
grievance with the great Garibaldi that his
native Savoy was handed over by Favour
to Napoleon 111. Kicciotti served in the
war of 1870-1. and was wounded, which
made him lame for life, with a sort of club
foot. He came to Melbourne shortly alter
the war, and all his three sons, Giuseppe,
Constantine and Bruno, were born here.
Premier McCulloch employed him as private
secretary. Although a good English scholar,
he was not up to his job. -They next made
him a truant inspector, and he was worse
at that than the other. Thenceforward he
knocked about, trying various dodgesi to
make a living. For some time lie had a lirtle
s h o p in Prahran. At last a tardy allowance
to the Garibaldis by the Italian Government
enabled him to return to Italy. Marcus
Clarke was very friendly with him. One of
Marcus’s favorite yarns was about Kicciotti
trying chicken incubation at Brighton, and
the machine blowing up.

The appropriations are made after the
March balance. Meantime all that need be
said on the accounts is that the book debts
(£72,230) are actually less than they were
six months ago, and represent only a shade
more than a fortnight’s supplies to retailers.
In view of the small capital (£24,045) and
the pauper reserves, this book-debts item is
most important; and the co. has done excel-
lently in keeping the figure so low, consider-
ing the national troubles we have run into.
As to the capital, though still ridiculously
small compared with the turnover, it is
slowly improving as bonuses are left in the
business. It wouldn’t be a bad idea to
arrange things so as to pay a 1\ p.c. divi-
dend in order to encourage the cusomers to
leave more of their bonuses behind them.
There’s hardly a limit to the capital that
could be employed—to the great advantage,
this paper believes, of producers and the
State generally. More than once The
Bulletin has suggested that, as a national
duty (if it will not regard the
matter favorably any other way), the
co. ought to put its organisation and
very special knowledge to use in doing
for the fruit and garden-produce trade
what it lias done for the butter business.
The opening of a branch in the Yanco irri-
gation area seems to suggest that the co.
may move at last. In the butter business the
co. has acted as the intermediary between
the co-operative factories and the retailers,
returning to the factories all the usual profits
of the wholesaler, less bare interest on the
capital employed; and if it will do only
that much in the garden-produce trade, the
public will be enormously benefited, even
though the retailer would still stand betwen
the public and cheap fruit and vegetables.
Anyway, the co. has made a start. And the
question of forming a separate co. to handle
N. S. Wales butter in London is also having
attention.

From T. H. Jones, Waratah (Tas.) : In
a _ Wild Cat” par. (12/11/T4) the Blythe
5*i ver . Ir ® n Co -’ s mine is described as
lassie s finest iron deposit.” I don’t wish
to depreciate the splendid ore deposit of the
Blythe River, with its estimated 22,000,000
tons in sight; but it is very small potatoes
alongside the huge magnetite formation
which traverses the Corinna goldfield, from
Specimen Reef in the north to Meredith
River in the south, a distance of over 20
miles. It is not claimed that the lede is
continuous for the full distance; it is a
' chain of enormous lenses in schistose rocks
almost in vertical position, with limestone
very adjacent on the west side in places.
This iron belt attains its greatest bulk at
the Rio Tin to mine, Savage River, showing
unusual width in the river bed, and rising
in mountainous masses on either side
to a height of 800 ft. This lens is to all
surface appearance five miles in length.
Allowing it the very moderate width of
oOft with an average height of 400 ft. above
the .Savage River, and taking 10 cubic feet
to the ton, this would give 52,800,000 tons.
It is more than likely this would not be half
the quantity available. At Brown’s Plain,
Whyte River, and Rocky River it is not so
large; but at Paradise and Meredith rivers
aV ag f m reaches mountainous proportions,
i- ... pth . the magnetite ore becomes
slightly pyritic, but probably not to such
an extent as to interfere with smelting
Anyhow, there are.millions of tons at surface
ot completely oxidised ore, which would
easily yield from 60 to 70 p.c. metal. The
natural outlet for this field is the at-present
bar-bound Pieman River, one of the largest,
if. not the largest, of Tassie’s numerous
trickles The Rio Tinto end of the lode is
lo or 20 miles distant from this stream, but
the southern end approaches within four
niilcs of deep water. The low-water sound-
ing on Pieman bar is 18ft., and this is said
to be easily capable of being deepened to
take the largest ships trading to these
shoies. Some day, when the Protectionist
majority—thrice returned to the Australian
jar!lament for the purpose of giving real
Protection—can no longer side-step their
pledges, this deposit may be worked, and a
great steel centre will spring up on the
banks of the Pieman—a community beside
which Hobart and Launceston will be mere
villages.

Though the Tongkah and other cos. are
dredging so many tons of tin out of Malavan
alluvial deposits, nothing is heard about‘the
remnants of the reefs from which presumably
™etal was sh(l d- The indefatigable
I. W. Horton, in a report to a Sydney co.,
recently made some incidental references to
the few lodes that have had attention. Near
Ipoh (Mengliinbu) there is a mine 500 ft.
deep. _ The shoots are lenticular, as usual
with tin bodies, but are large and strong.
The grade is, however, poor. Still, if the
mine were worked right there should be
money in it. The most successful operations
appear to be near Bentong, where the reefs
are smaller but much richer. From one little
shoot no more than 50ft. long a profit of
£lOOO per foot has been made down to- 40ft.
Other deposits consist of dense sulphides in
slate. On the whole, Mr. Horton doesn’t
think it worth while troubling about tin lodes
while there is alluvial to be looked for. Talk-
ing of other metals, he mentions that the
Raub Australian gold mine, \yhich 25 years
ago was going to make Sydney rich, is still
working in a fairly large way, treating 4000
tons a month; but as some of the stuff is
worth less than 3dwt., profits are poor and
dividends very irregular. All the other
mines in the neighborhood have been given
best.

Arnott’s Milk Arrowroot Biscuits
“THE CHILDREN’S FOOD.”
“The Oldest Inhabitant” : Concerning gib-
bets and culture (B. 31/12/T4). A
lurid light is thrown upon this gib-
bet business in convict times by a
notice in Bent’s Hobart Town Gazette of
June 8, 1816: “As the bodies of the felons ■
that were gibbeted on Hunter’s Island were
close to the place where the wharf is erected,
and became objects of disgust, especially to
the female sex, they have been remoAed (by
command of his Honor the Lieutenant-Gov-
ernor) to a point of land near Queens-
borough, which, in future, will be the place
of execution.” That shows you how fastidi-
ous people were getting even so early as
1816.
“E.T.” : In Auckland, the other week,
Julius Knight and the members of the J. C.
Williamson Co. gave a Sunday evening con-
cert to help swell the Queen Mary fund for
wounded soldiers. Permission had first to
be obtained of the Mayor, and the event was
duly advertised. No money was taken at
the door; tickets of admission had to be got
during the week preceding. Will it be be-
lieved that, even under those conditions, an
attempt was made to stop the entertain-
ment? In a letter to the press a reverend
gent, named Dowle, hon. sec. of the Chris-
tian Evidence Society, declared that the
whole thing was “an attempt to undermine
the sanctity of the Day of Rest!” “The
Christian Sabbath is being flouted !” the dis-
mal bird howled. The show, however, came
off in spite of him. Had the Christian
Heaviness Society had its way the wounded
soldiers’ fund would have been the poorer
by considerably oyer £lOO.
“Coot”: Blood will tell. Compare
Macaulay on Frederick the Great, with what
is happening now: —
The whole world sprang to arms. On the head of
Frederick is all the blood which was shed in a war
which raged during many years and in every quarter
of the globe, the blood of the column of Fontenoy, the
blood of the mountaineers who were slaughtered at
Culloden. The evils produced by his wickedness
were felt in lands where the name of Prussia was
unknown; and, in order that he might rob a neighbor
whom he had promised to defend, etc., etc.
The “kultur” humbug is not even an original
fraud :—-. -
Frederick loved to think of himself as a sublime
musician, a poetaster and metaphysician, who alter-
nately insulted and petted the men of genius who
were his guests.
Also, both monarchs posed as supreme
moralists, and neither was in the least
moral. This is the ultimatum of Frederick
to Maria Theresa :-
He sent her a message which could be regarded
only as an insult. If she would let him have Silesia
he would, he said, stand by her against any Power
which should try to deprive her of her other
dominions; as if he was not already bound to stand
by her, or as if his new promise oould be of more
value than the old one.
It is the message which Germany sent
Britain five months ago—an offer which, as
Lord Crewe said, “could be only effectively
answered by a blow.”
“Ruru”: I hereby curse, denounce, con-
temn and revile the public telephone box.
The genius who first conceived the idea of
hermetically sealing the sides and top of the
concern did so with the intention of suffo-
cating any person attempting to use the
’phone for more than the regulation two
minutes. His notion was that the giddy
young thing who wants to giggle over the
wire and so block the urgent business mes-
sage must do so at the risk of her life. His
calculations failed at two points : (1) the
giddy young thing proved tougher than lie
expheted, and contrived to live on in the
telephone coffin even when the last whiff of
oxygen was exhausted and the fiercest flv
had fallen to the floor, and (2) the leisurely
methods of the other young thing at the Ex-
change prevented the average citizen getting
the number he required until senile decay
began to be added to the horrors of asphyxi-
ation. «The whole telephone system is bad
enough, but the public telephone vault or
sarcophagus is the very worst thing the sys-
tem has yet perpetrated. Which is to say. it
is about the worst thing on this earth, not
forgetting German honor and the death
adder.

How She Stopped Her
Husband’s Drinking.
By all Means Write to Her
and Bearn How She Did It.
For over 20 years James Anderson, of
003 Elm Ave., Hilllmrn. N.Y., U.S.A., was a
very hard drinker. His case seemed a hope-
A
À
Á
ago his wife, in their own
little home, gave him
a simple remedy which,
much to her delight,
stopped his drinking
entirely.
To make sure that
the remedy was respon-
sible for this happy re-
sult she also tried it on
her brother and several
of her neighbors. It
was successful in every
ease* None of them has
touched a drop of in-
toxicating liquor since.
She now wishes everyone who has drunk-
enness in their homes to try this simple
remedy, for she feels sure that it will do as
much for others as it has for her. It can be
given secretly if desired, and without cost
she will gladly and willingly tell you what it
is. All you have to do is write her a letter
asking her how she cured her husband of
drinking, and she will reply by return mail
in a sealed envelope. As she has nothing to
sell do not send her money. Simply send a
letter with all confidence to Mrs, Margaret
Anderson at; the address given above, taking
care to write your name and full address
plainly. (We earnestly advise every one of
oar readers who wishes t'o cure a dear one
of drunkenness to 'irrite to this lady to-day.

HOW I DARKENED MY
GREY HAIR.
Lady Gives Simple Home Recipe That
She Used to Darken Her Grey Hair.
For years I tried to restore my grey hair
to its natural color with the prepared dyes
and stains, but none of them gave satisfac-
tion, and they were all expensive. I finally
came across a simple recipe which I mixed
at home that gives wonderful results. I
gave the recipe, which is as follows, to a
number of my friends, and they are all
delighted with it: To 7oz. of water add a
small box of Orlex Compound, loz. of bay
rum and Joz. of glycerine. Use every
other day until the hair becomes the
required shade, then eVery two weeks. It
will not only darken the grey hair, but
removes dandruff and scalp humors, and
acts as a tonic to the hair. It is not sticky
or greasy, does not rub off and does not
color the scalp. You can obtain these
ingredients from your chemist and prepare
it at home at very little expense.* [6

James K. Murdoch: Two quotations from
your own letter will do: —(1) May 20th, 1880
(Hansard) : He (Bradlaugh) considered he had a
legal right to choose between the alternatives of
making an affirmation or taking the oath, and he
felt it clearly his moral duty, in that case, to make
an affirmation. The oath included words which, to
him, were meaningless.” (2) “July 2nd, 1880
(Hansard): Bradlaugh- takes the affirmation of
allegiance and his seat.” Now, for pity’s sake, drop
the whole wearisome subject. The same prayer
applies to H.A.T A.S.W.: ‘“Kicking Strap’s
Race’ is in a shilling book of humorous stuff by J.
Hickory Wood. Any booksellers.” Thanks....
Clinker: Well told ; but older than the oldest whaler

angel is the only touch of interest. Idea very slight
and roughly handled. .. .V.B. : You toil like a

The N. S. Wales Department of Education
has now three travelling schools, whose work
is fairly strenuous. One of them pads the
tracks out from Inverell. It has completed
five circuits, travelling a total distance of
1297 miles, to carry education to 47 pupils.
That means, roughly, an average of 5i miles
per pupil per visit.
“Ink Slave”: “Clerkling” wrote (B.
31/12/’l4) about a rich solicitor who
wanted more people to volunteer, and was
bitterly scornful because they didn’t. ihe
average attorney is hardly the sort of self-
renunciatory person to inspire the masses
to deeds of heroic altruism. I am employed
by a firm which specialises in conveyanc-
ing. There hasn’t been over-much doing in
that line of late, so some of our bosses
waited on a number of other firms with a
view to persuading them to reduce screws
drastically. Luckily for us the firms applied
to were in th'e commercial line where busi-
ness is brisk and they weren’t taking any.
When, in dread of compulsory service,
people dash out and ask young men to
come and be enrolled, a delicate problem
will be the selection of the dashers. Wealthy
young men and volunteer officers who are'
not going to the Front themselves should
be kept out of the oratorical firing-line, if
they haven’t enough sense to keep them-
selves out. Also all employers who have
reduced wages owing allegedly to the war,
or who have permanently sacked employees
who have volunteered. The man who should
be chosen for recruiting orator needs to be
either under 45 and just off to the Front
himself, or older than that and well known
for valor and unselfishness. A skilfully-
selected lot of advocates might do almost as
much good as a Compulsory Service Act.
The other sort will simply, transform the
non-compulsory movement into a howling
absurdity.
“D.”: Allies habitually go in constant
fear of international jealousies. The safe-
guard, in the present case, is the fact that
the leaders who are in immediate touch with
one another are neither vain nor loquacious.
It is the gasconading genius who causes
dissension. A more silent, unspectacular
lot than Kitchener, French and Joffre you
couldn’t get if you raked Europe. A recent
photograph of King George inspecting some
Highlanders showed a number of military
personages in flaming uniforms, and, rather
in the background, a stout figure in bowler
hat, low collar, small black tie and formless
overcoat. It was Joffre. Picture an
Augereau or a Murat or a Tilly consenting
to appear at such a function in such a cos-
tume ! Grant might have dorie it, or
Napoleon, or Sim. Bolivar; but then
they were pluggers and not dandies.
No' unbusinesslike captiousness need be
expected from a generalissimo who
attends a review in a bowler hat. But the
Allies’ difficulty doesn’t compare with the
German problem of the Royal General. For
the past five months whenever mere com-
moners like Von Ivluck (he is really plain
Kluck, the “von” having been bestowed but
a few years ago) have gained a success, the
driving of it home has been entrusted to the
Crown Prince, to Duke Albert of Wurtem-
burg, to the Crown Prince Rupert of
Bavaria, or to one of the other princelings.
The result has invariably been failure where
success appeared to be assured. The
Germans have learned by bitter experience
that their Royal Generals are not the best
available, and their fighting naturally
deteriorates as soon as one of them comes
into prominence. The deposition of Von
Ingenohl —reputedly Germany’s greatest
sailor —and the handing of his position to
Prince Henry, the Kaiser’s brother, is the
most recent instance of the sort of thing
that is ruining the morale of the Teuton
fighting men. If the Allies don’t win before
next spring it will simply be because there
are not enough Royal Generals and Admirals
to go round all the responsible positions.
From J. A. Wright: “0.K.” says (B.
24/12/T4) that “the desire to keep the
profession of army officer for the “uppah”
classes is the reason why Britain’s rulers
are against compulsory service.” He is
back in the Stone Age of British thought.
Universal service is, and has been for the
past 10 years at least, the pet policy of the
British officer and the British Tory. If
“0.K.” doubts it, let him look up the back
files of any of the Service publications, or
of the Times, Morning Post and Daily
Mail. “The reason why Britain’s rulers
are against compulsory service” is uncon-
nected with the sentiments of British Army
officers, not one in 20 of whom votes Liberal.
It is a matter of placating the supporters
of Liberalism. The whole of the cocoa press
is hostile to what it miscalls conscription,
from the Daily News to the Manchester
Guardian. The bitterest enemies of the
movement are the British Labor leaders,
such as Ramsay McDonald and Keir
Hardie. Blatchford himself said that his
articles in favor of compulsory, service
brought him unpopularity among his fellow
socialists. With very few exceptions Army
officers are the most strenuous advocates of
the form of service which Britain’s rulers
dislike. When I was in England before the
war I spoke to dozens of officers, and they
one and all lamented the fact that they had
not a system like Australia’s, which they
thought a very good one.
The row over the Church-street bridge has
continued to bring Melbourne’s tinpot muni-
cipal system into contempt. Prahran had
declared the bridge unsafe and blocked it
by bolting heavy steel troughing to the
standards, thus forcing traffic to go miles
out of its way. But one night some evil-
disposed parties removed the obstruction and
heaved it in the Yarra, and traffic re-
sumed its old beat. Prahran’s council
foamed when it heard of this outrage, and
despatched one laborer, with timber, to put
up a fresh barricade. • Naturally he, poor,
lone man, was unceremoniously tossed aside
and stacked in the gutter on his stinks.
Then the Mayor and councillors motored
down in wrath, instructed the lone laborer to
replace his poles, and dared anyone to remove
them. The bluff held for a few minutes,
when it became evident that the increasing-
mass of traffic would sweep laborer, sticks,
Mayor, councillors and motor all into the
river, if they didn’t shift, so they shifted.
Next day Minister Hagelthorn sent an
engineer down to see if Prahran had obeyed
his instructions to repair the bridge and get
it open by the 6th inst., and finding it had
done nothing, he put on a gang of men and will
send the bill to the two councils concerned.
When he has finished that small matter he
might take the job of building a Greater Mel-
bourne Council Bill out of Peacock’s bands.
Anyone, even a rich landlord like Hagel-
thorn, who will do something in Victorian
politics, is a blessing and not to be wasted.
THE DOWNFALL OF BELGIAN.
Laden with piles of luggage
In a large and piteous band
Flocked the refugees of Belgian
A-driven from their land ;
Men, women and little children
Bowed with grief and woe
Arrived in dear old England
From the cruel german foe.
Upon their city Buildings
Huge shells did fall and burst,
Their noble heroes slaughtered
Poor Belgian was accurst;
The german wolves of battle
Had dealt a fearful Blow,
And thousands grimly yearneth
For the downfall of the foe.

I heard a young mother talking to
her little son about his teeth, telling him
how important it is that the teeth be kept clean.
“If you want to be a big, strong boy,” she said, “and then a big, strong man, you
must have good teeth. And, to keep your teeth sound you must remember now
while you are a little boy, to brush them twice every day. Ihe young mother told
me th it the youngster liked the taste of the Ribbon Dental Cream, and that this
had helped her in inducing him to form the important daily habit. Of course,
she talked with him about it now and then to impress on him ; the great advantage
to his health and comfort that comes with this > daily care. Then twice a year,
she added, “I have the dentist look him over.”

IN BANANA LAND
Brisbane’s recent annual hospital cadge,
a degrading business to all concerned, showed
a woeful slump. Hospital Day gave only
£7OO as against £l3OO in 1913. Incidentally
Abe Barrington, a bookmaker, suggests that
the money foolishly wasted on “floral tri-
butes” at funerals should be devoted to
charities—a suggestion nearly as full of
horse-sense as that people should make the
same use of the money they now waste on
the bookmaker.
The Railway Department, desiring to per-
petuate the memory of a fine old pioneer,
changed the name of North Pine station to
Petrie. North Pine, in protest, has erected
a huge board opposite the station, bearing
the old name writ large. Somehow, in this
matter of nomenclature, Andrew Petrie has
had no luck. The bunya bunya pine was
found and brought to Brisbane by him
nearly 80 years ago. It was duly christened
Pinus Petriana; but the name was subse-
quently _ and ridiculously changed to Arau-
caria Bidwelli, Bidwell being a clerk in the
Government office which handled these mat-
ters.
“Cleveland” on the Northern fruit trade:
W. ’ (B. 17/12/’l4) does no more than prove
that North Queensland bananas can be transported to
the southern capitals when he states . that white-
grown and packed bananas have been landed in Perth
in good condition; but he doesn’t disprove any of
my statements to the effect that the general condi-
tions under which the bulk of N.Q. fruit is handled
are such as to make the growing of fruit for the
southern markets a hazardous venture. He asseverates
that immature fruit is more liable to damage and
decay than ripe fruit; but if he knows anything
about the Sydney and Melbourne markets he knows
that any fruit showing the least signs of ripening is
not allowed to land, but is torn off the bunches and
carried away to sea and there dumped. I have re-
peatedly seen heaps of bananas (sometimes a third of
the total shipment) piled up on a ship’s deck and
saturated with kerosene. The master of the ship has
to subsequently sign a statement showing the lat.
and long, where this, rejected fruit was -jettisoned. I
was never able to ascertain why it was not allowed
to go into consumption, beyond that it showed signs
of becoming eatable. If, as “W.” states, special

allowed to approach anything resembling maturity
before being shipped, the heathens in those villages
fire it out on arrival. Personally, I favor an applica-
tion of thumbscrews and horsehair shirts. Inci-

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The cruiser Brisbane will not be completed before
the end of 1915. ' '
There is a patch o’ peaceful land where tired
toilers rest
And pass a spell o’ leisure through in com-
fort with the best;
The boss is alluz easy with ’is failin’ fellow-
men,
And comrade calls to comrade: “Bill, ’ere’s
fill ’em up agen !”
They’re never dull or blue,
Their ’opes .are alluz new,
They never put no ’ustle on at tranquil
Cockatoo.
They set ter build a cruiser once (’twas in
the Long Ago) ;
I used ter dream I saw ’er launched w’ile
sailors sung “Yeo-ho” ;
I used ter dream she’d soon be off in triumph
o’er the main,
While .ev’ry foe that saw ’er smoke would
skip for ’ome again;
But only visions grew
Of sturdy ship and crew ;
There was no growin’ worth a cuss in lan-
guorous Cockatoo.
The foremen they were suckin’ slow the
amber pipe of peace ;
The riveters were hummin’ low, “Let war
an’ tumult cease” ;
The strike at first wuz frequent, but the
stroke wuz mostly slow,
An’ no one swung ’is ’ammer round with vim
in ev’ry blow.
The day w’en she were due
They fixed a plate or two
Upon ’er bristlin’ skeleton in placid Cockatoo.
The war broke out w’ile she were stiff up-
standing in the stocks,
And not a farthin’ could 'she fight, with
Britain near the rocks;
But “Brother’ood” was all a-boom with boys
an’ men an’ bosses;
An’ wot the dickens did it count if England
’ad ’er losses?
Their ’earts were alwuz true,
An’ w’en their pay wuz due
Twuz sweet to see ’em rake it in at gentle
Cockatoo.
And them as lorded over ’em were just as
sweet an’ nice;
They never ’ad the nerve to ask if Bill wuz
worth ’is price;
They never tried to push the craft or made
a rude remark
That cruisers called for quicker work than
Noah’s ancient Ark.
They gave the men the cue ;
“Oh, do not overdo
Your little job or strain your strength in
lenient Cockatoo.”
An’ w’en we’re fin’lly battered down an’
level with the dust
Some learned cove will find ’er ribs all rotted
through with rust,
An’ wonder ’ow the dooce it was she never
took to sea.
W’en ev’ry bumboat carried men to face the
enemy.
Per’aps ’e’U find a clue
’Ow matters went askew
W’en up the Rip Van Winkles wake ’oo slept
at Cockatoo.
QUEENSLAND.
PHILANDER FLAM.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, January 9, 1915.
My Dear Tiiargomindah.—
The weather-man has at last tendered suc-
cessfully for honorable mentibn, after giving
us samples of violent heat and equally vio-
lent storms for the past week. We are now
having a spell of cool spring.
For your private ear, my dear. Dorothea
Collins (the sixth daughter in the Tamroo-
lcum Collins household) and Douglas Fraser,
the second son of the Frasers, of Toorak,
Melbourne, are about to say “I will” to each
other with the fullest intention of keeping
their promise. The Frasers, like the Col-
linses, own no end of mutton cutlets, in
Queensland. A sister of the bride to be is
Mrs. Douglas Harris, at present travelling
to Egypt, which is a Sort of dependency of
Ails a alia these days.
An epidemic of weddings threatens to
break out, and so many of our fascinating
girls are billed to permanently join the men
of their choice that the members of the
Clergymen’s Union will clear up their holi-
days exes, by overtime pay. Harry Scales
(of the “Dandies”) and Miss Maisie Red-
grave will lead off on Monday; and Miss
Mabel Woolcock (one of the best profes-
sional singers Bananaland has produced)
and her lucky fiance will follow. Miss
Mollie Ferrier, who was one of the brides-
maids at the recent Connolly-Earwaker
wedding, will play the star rble in a cere-
mony scheduled for the first week of Febru-
ary. Her partner’s name is Mackay. Miss
Feez, who has also many times played brides-
maid, will be promoted to leading lady, with
James Henry as the beautiful hero.
„ Last Wednesday dainty Cecil St. John-
King was wedded to Ernest Corser, the
youngest member of the Harry Corser
family, of Maryborough. Misses Kathleen
St. John-King and Sylvia Francis supported
and comforted the bride, and Messrs. Stewart
Corser and Stewart urged the bridegroom
to bear up.
Southport-by-the-Sea is something in the
nature of a Mecca these days, and the vil-
is having a bumper season. The P I
feymes lady and a daughter of the MacTasr-
gart clan worked up a “hummer” of a
concert during their sojourn in the waterinsr-
place, for the benefit of the Belgian Fund.
As a benefit it was good business; as an
entertainment it beat the massed bands.
Miss Marjorie Robertson has been filling
in her odd moments packing frocks and frill-
enes in preparation for her trip to America.
Bananaland will be officially represented at
the Panama Exhibition by J. A. Robertson
and he is taking daughter Marjorie along
with him.
Hugh Buckler, who has left to rejoin his
regiment (18th Royal Irish), had a great
send-off,. and his portmanteau threatened to
burst with the tokens of good feeling. Mem-
bers of the profesh. rolled up seven deep
and the few private friends who were aware
of the event tumbled out of bed earlier
than usual to wave farewell and join in
It’s a Long Way to Tipperary” on the

it: sounds a trifle better than the
old, brutal “no encumbrances.” Still, what-
ever form it is in, it makes one wish some-
body had got hold of the advertiser’s parents
and hired them on the same terms.
Queensland Labor confidently prophesies
the kick-out of the Denham party next May.
But all political prophecy is dangerous.
, w “n the Fisher Government was defeated
in. 1909 Oom.Bill Lyne pointed to Irvine and
cried: “I will have that man out of the
House yet.” But the Iceberg still floats on
the jobble of politics, while Oom Bill is
gathered to his fathers.
“ J-D.M.”; When he first arrived in the
Moreton Bay district, “Bob” Philp got a
small job on the Darling Downs Gazette,
then recently-established. His friend in
getting this billet was the late J. C. White,
manager for the then great squatting firm of
Mort, Tooth and Holt. Afterwards he went
jackerooing on Jimbour station. In those
days both Bob and elder brother Jack
were spoken of as remittance men, with
favorable prospects. Their father was a
well-to-do brewer in Scotland.
Though Queensland didn’t howl and
whimper about it, it suffered more from the
war within the first few months than any
other State, if Knibbs’s figures are correct.
At the end of September there were 10 per
cent, more Queenslanders unemployed than
at the end of June, 1914, and over 9 per
cent, more than at the end of September,
1913; whereas in N. S. Wales, which was
almost howling the top of its head off, and
calling on Father Bull to take pity, the in-
crease of unemployment was only 3i percent,
compared with either June, 1914, or Sep-
tember, 1913. In fact, with the exception
of Westralia, N. S. Wales was the smallest
immediate sufferer among the States.
“Tula”: Re destruction of Queensland
timber (B. 31/12/’l4). I’m no fonder than
anyone else of seeing fine trees cut down
and burned; but most of the heated stuff
written on the subject of the destruction
is pure nonsense. Take Atherton for ex-
ample, because that is where the most valu-
able timber has been cut; The Chow corn-
grower monopolises most of the land ad-
jacent to the railway, which land was
selected by the old-timers at half a crown
per acre and has long been denuded of
timber. , The later arrivals, those who pin
their faith to Strawberry, had to select in
the backblocks, in many cases 20 miles
from the railway, at an average price of
£2 10s. per acre. Three years ago Pre-
mier Denham promised to extend the Tolga-
Malanda railway to Millaa Millaa, a dis-
tance of 16 miles as surveyed. The
promise remained unfulfilled until a
few months ago, when the first six miles
was started to give relief to miners who had
lost their jobs owing to the war. Recently
a bullocky with 16 bullocks took 4| days
to travel to Millaa Millaa, a distance of
15 miles by road, with three tons aboard.
Fortunately the track was dry at the time;
had it been wet he would have arrived
simultaneously with the imperishable
brotherhood of man. As it costs 3s. per
100 super feet to carry red beech (or
Queensland maple, as it is called in the
South) a distance of three miles, and as
it is worth at most Bs. on the trucks, how
is the cocky to cart it (say) 12 miles, pay
cutting and loading rates, and show a
profit? There clearly isn’t any profit in
the timber business for the innumerable
backblocks cocky, so he is compelled to
sacrifice the trees.

Great Danger of
Insed Bites.
DOCTOR’S ALARMING STATEMENTS.
Protect Yourself Against Ordinary
Dangers by using ?
NEV-A-BITE
“There is no question/’ says a leading
specialist, “that insect bites may lead to great
danger to health, and have been known to end
fatally.”
This alarming
statement, which
has appeared in
the influential
newspapers of this
country, should
arouse the public
to the fact that
bites from mos-
quitoes and other
insects are things
tp worry about.
It is quite pos-
sible that if one’s
blood is in a poor
state an insect
bite might set up
such iserious in-
flammation as to
cause blood-poi-
The dread Mosquito,
whose bite is perhaps
the most dangerous of
all insects .
soning, and —as everyone well knows —blood-
poisoning may lead to even the amputation of
a limb.
One has only to glance at the illustration
given here of the mosquito to realise what
terrifying. poison-iniecting parts this insect
has. It is absolutely necessary, not only for
the woman who desires to keep her complexion
in its natural conditipn, but also for the pro-
tection against more .serious dangers, to secure
some reliable preparation which will prevent
insects from biting.
The best form of treatment of mosquito bites
is prophylactic, or preventive. The application
of a little of the Nev-a-bite lotion to the
forehead, neck and the instep (when openwork
stockings are worn) reduces the probability of
mosquito-bites to a minimum.
Nev-a-bite is a perfectly harmless pre-
paration, - and serves to whiten, soften and
beautify the skin.
Nev-a-bite can be obtained at 9d. per
bottle. Postage 3d. extra from —-

A perfect
Storage
Battery
Before the Edison Storage Battery was
placed on the market, the one weak spot
in the electric waggon was the heavy
lead battery.
Even under the supervision of an expert
it has short' life —from 8 to 15 months
only.
That weak spot is completely overcome
by the advent of the Edison Storage
Battery. It overcomes all the draw-
backs of the lead-acid combination.
There is no lead to crumble nor acids to
destroy, and the weight is one-half for
the same output.
We will send details to any address.
Please mention what batteries are
needed for when writing.
We are equipped with the necessary
plant to recharge these batteries at low

“Billy Blue’’: The first libel action in
Australia was heard in October and Decem-
ber, 1817, and was brought by the senior
chaplain, Samuel Marsden, against John
Thomas Campbell, private secretary to
Governor Macquarie. During 1816 rela-
tions between Marsden and Macquarie were
strained, and finally they tore apart. Camp-
bell, irritated by what he considered Mars-
den’s discourtesy towards Macquarie, in-
serted in the Sydney Gazette of January
4, 1817, under the signature of “Philo Free,”
a violent attack upon the moral and com-
mercial honesty of Marsden as the agent
of the Church Missionary \ Society. Mars-
den, after some delay in identifying Camp-
bell as the writer, applied to Judge Advo-
cate Wylde to institute criminal proceedings
against Campbell. Further delay took
place, Wylde and others trying to settle
the matter by getting Campbell to publish
an . apology; but Marsden’s stubborn will
insisted on a trial, and in October following
the action proceeded before the usual Bench
of military officers, with Wylde presiding.
The Court found Campbell guilty of writing
the letter and that the letter was a libel;
but Marsden, through his solicitor, did not
press for judgment. The Gazette, which
was subject to Campbell’s censorship,
reported the trial in §uch a way that it
amounted to a fresh libel; and Marsden
then proceeded against Campbell in the
, Civil Court. Judge Field presided, and the
parson was awarded £2OO damages and
costs (about £500). Further, Campbell
received from Lord Bathurst, Secretary for
the Colonies, a severe reprimand, and was
shortly afterwards superseded by Colonial
Secretary Goulburn.
“N.L.”: The question as to the author-
ship of “The Marquis of Carabas” (B.
31/12/T4) is answered by the fact that
Robert Barnabas Brough’s version appeared
in a volume of acknowledged translations
from Beranger—“Songs of the Empire, the
Peace and the Restoration.” The book was
dedicated to Brough’s artist friend, the cele-
brated Dante Gabriel Rossetti. My copy
once belonged to George Collins Levey, who
claimed to be the founder of “cheap jour-
nalism” in Australia, on the ground that, as
editor and proprietor of the Melbourne
Herald from 1863 to 1868, he issued the
paper at a penny. He also edited “Hutchin-
son’s Australasian Encyclopaedia,” and did
other useful deeds here and abroad. Every-
body had a shot at translating bits of Beran-
ger in the years between 1820 and IB6o—
Praed, “Father Prout” and a
host of. others. Brough did well, particu-
larly with “The Acrobat,’’ a satire on the
lightning flipflaps of political adventurers.
His tendency towards satire was further
shown in his original democratic “Songs of
the Ruling Classes,” and in such a title to
one of his stage burlesques as “Medea; or
The Best of Mothers”—Medea being the
classical dame who murdered her two sons,
boiled her uncle-in-law, cut her little brother
into bits, and amused herself in other such
ways. Portraits show R. B. Brough to have
had a great resemblance to his son, our
Robert.
* * * *
“Evening Bloodstain”: Why is the news-
paper always so eager to tell the age ;of the
pel son who lias fallen out of a cab, or been
arrested or robbed? Anyone would think
that age was the only known method of
identifying people in print and the only
detail that other people were curious -about.
Ihen the conventional styles of the various
writers grow wearisome. I would give £1
(in lOU’s) to find a police item like the
following in any respectable newspaper:—
Last night Mary Smithjones (red hair and- a fine
figure, one gold tooth) was knocked down by a taxi-
cab while drunk in Pitt-street. She was uninjured
bnt greatly annoyed, and her flow of language
towards the taxi-driver was greatly admired. Traffic-
constable Beetlecrusher flew gradually to the rescue
m a neatly-fitting uniform, and assisted her off
amidst a scene of delightful confusion, during which
banana skins, confetti and insults were hurled. Her
going-away dress was extensively slashed up the side:
She expects to go into residence at Long Bay, and
will not be at home in her pretty Balmain cottage
for at least a month.
And again :—-
A quiet but desperate attempt to give a “pretty
reception” was made last night at Jobson House,
Darlinghurst, by an elderly woman who afterwards
said her name was Ann Viewharbor, and described
herself as a widow, aged, 51, in affluent circum-
stances. Fortunately the attention of Constable Glum
was attracted by a string of lighted Chinese lanterns
which the woman Viewharbor had been Jncautious’
enough to hang on a tree, and they promptly entered
and arrested all on the premises. Great praise is du£
to the officer for his vigilance and promptitude. If
his brother-officers would only show similar zeal, this
class of crime would soon be stamped out.
* * * *
“Scribe”: One Belirin, of the New York
Supreme Court, has been certified “champion
shorthand writer of the world,” through a
competition at Atlanta, U.S.A. Rubbish!
Shorthand is less practised in the United
States than in any other great nation.
Therefore, on the mere doctrine of probabili-
ties, I would assume that the acme is else-
where. My further fancy is that the light-
ning man (or woman), is not a Pitman. That
system, is the most logical, but a combination
in which memory plays a stronger part is
likely to beat it.
* * * *
More curse of Federation! A theatrical
manager faded away recently leaving his
stage hands unpaid. They had no redress
under the State law, the manager being out
of the jurisdiction. The men decided to wait
a month while the boss was implored by
letter to part up. He was duly implored,
and he remained as shy with the money as
ever. Then their counsel played the Fed-
eral card, and it was a trump. Half a
dozen then. got verdicts, with costs in each
case, and if their elusive ex-employer still
omits to. pay within a specified time he will
be required to do a month in respect of
each casa There is reason to think that
part, at least, of the old Geebung’s frantic
hatred of Federation was the realisation
that it meant the death of the system
under which a worthy citizen who had
taken people down in one State was safe
once he got on the other side of the border.

CRAIG 8 AITKBN,
654 George St.,
SYDNEY.
Established. Over SO 1 ears.
Gone aloft at 88, Cap’n Ellis, who from
1844 to 1892 commanded sailing ships from
England to Australia and Maoriland. His
cargoes varied from convicts and immigrants
to sundries and soldiers. He carried the
last military consignment to M.L. during
the Maori war.
The 59th issue of Sands and McDougall’s
Directory of Victoria is just 25 pages larger
than last volume. The publication, which
for years was only a matter of Melbourne
interest, now runs to 8028 pages, and nearly
1000 of them are devoted to the country dis-
tricts. It all shows the usual careful compi-
lation.
A very old friend is alleged to be lying on
his death-bed in Sydney. The Lord Mayor
says he has a scheme for doing away with
the garbage punt, which fills up the adjacent
sea and sheds its old refuse on the beaches.
If this ancient vessel is really breathing its
last Sydney will be a cleaner place in con-
sequence. But the obscene craft has often
revived when it was supposed that its heart
had stopped, and people are reluctant to buy
a black coat and a hat-band for the inter-
ment.
Victorian Chief Secretary John Murray
gets inspirations in his dreams occasionally.
Spoken to about the necessity for encourag-
ing Australian-made films at the picture
shows, he remarked “I’ll fix ’em. When they
come round to get" their licenses renewed
there will be a clause binding them to show
one Australian-made film for every foreign
one put on. Penalty for first breach —can-
cellation of the license.” Or course, various
people interested in keeping themselves fat
and Australia lean breathe heavily and call
it “unconstooshnal” ; but it’s a bright idea
and worth risking.
“The Old Soldier” :
Kitchener, Britain’s strictly non-party War Mini-
ster, said last week that “he was not discontented
with the progress of recruiting. As many men were
coming forward as could be dealt with.” Can’t the
local calamity-howlers see that that is a fiat contra-
diction of the nonsense Joe Cook and Millen have
been talking? If Australia were to do what these
wild complainers want (or say they want) and send
off 100,000 men, untrained and unequipped, for Kit-
chener to train and equip as he best could, the result
would simply be to embarrass the United Kingdom’s
supply services. Cook, Millen and others don’t
understand, apparently, that the supply and manu-
facturing services of the British army were, till this
war broke out, on a scale to serve an army limited
to 150,000 men, For this reason, Britain needs more
from Australia than men at 6s. per day. It needs
material, too.
The water-front heaved a sigh of relief
when the missing schooner Cavan turned tip
after a 10 days’ jaunt on the Tasman Sea.
The Cavan was purchased by the Newcastle
Browns for their coal trade. Originally a
barque, it was turned into something like
a sea-going punt. For some years past it
has been safely towed up and down between
Newcastle and Sydney; but on December
30 last the towing steamer dropped its
propeller in a howling south-west gale some-
where near the half-way mark, and the
Cavan broke away. Luckily the wind was
off shore, and when the gale blew itself out
the schooner was 150 miles from land. A
rummage for provisions was being anxiously
conducted when a north-easterly slant
brought the tub under the land. It isn’t
the first time this N.E. weather has been
a boon to small sailing craft. Recently, for
instance, the scow Tramp was dismasted a
couple of hundred miles east of Newcastle ;
and though abandoned by the crew the hull
of the vessel sailed itself almost into the
Manning River.
On the last day of the sad Old Year an
article headed “Trading with the Enemy”
was hurled at the Vacuum Oil Co. by Mel-
bourne Age, which told motor-oil buyers
that the Vacuum Co. had contracts with the
German Navy before the War broke out,
and that a German-American co. which was
formerly linked with the Vacuum in the great
“Standard” combine, had subscribed £lOO,OOO
to the German wan -loan. Whereupon the
Vacuum fired a writ for libel into the Age
office, claiming £20,000 damages. Some
days later the paper withdrew the sugges-
tions and warnings which had evoked the
writ. The co., it seems, had not been trad-
ing with the enemy since the war broke out,
nor was it in any way responsible for the
behavior of the German-American Co. which
subscribed the £lOO,OOO to the German war
loan. As to trade 'before war broke out, it is
doubtful whether any large oil company was
free from that. For that matter, a lot of
cannons fired at the invading Germans by
the Belgians were made in Germany, and a
lot of coal ordered for German Navy pur-
poses came from Britain. Anyway, the
Vacuum Oil Co. in Melbourne is good Aus-
tralian as regards employees who have joined
the Expeditionary forces—29 of them in all.
Their billets are kept open for them, and
where the Army wage is less than what the
soldier was drawing from the Vac., he gets
the difference from the co.
‘•‘Snaffle”: One Blennerhassett is commis-
sioned by the English War Office to buy
horses in Australia. A British cavalry officer
has alleged, though I cannot believe "it, that
the average life of a horse at the Front in
Belgium and France has been about 10 days.
It is incredible, seeing that something like
three million horses are engaged in the War.
It is said Germany lost a million in 1870-1,
and in the U.S. Civil War the computation
was a loss of 500 a day. Germany called for
nearly 800,000 on mobilisation. Englhrid'
had collected over 400,000 before the end Of
November. The Czar probably has a million
in cavalry, artillery and transport. Though
figures as to wastage may be exaggerated,
the European horse shortage will be unpre-
cedented. So far Australian breeders have
done best with Clydesdales, but they may do
better in future with mediums or roadsters.
The Powers have been buying heavily in
America, and are getting to the end of that
not-mighty resource. During the year pre-
ceding the War Germany was draining Eng-
land, and, it will be remembered, complaints
were made on that score. As soon as the
trouble started England commandeered every
fit horse it could lay its hands upon; and the
opening up of a buying market so far away
as Australia proves that the U.S. and
Canada are now going dry. War Minister
Pearce knows our supply is decidedly meagre.
“Copy Boy”: The spread of culture among
Melbourne’s municipal dignitaries is tending
to make the reporting of council meetings
a liberal education. There was a fine liter-
ary flavor about the reply made the other
n i j an Mdermanic highbrow when
asked for his views on the matter under
debate the removal of the boiling-down
works or something. “At present, sir,” he
announced, “I am in the position of Lord
Macaulay waiting for something to turn
up.”
“Solomon M.” writes :
Possibly, when Britain gets that extra 2,000,000
soldiers ready it will find the snort road into Ger-
many via Norway and Sweden, then across the narrow
straits and down through Denmark. If stupen-
dous land batteries got to work on the Kiel Canal the
German fleet would either have to fight or bolt.
Either way the canal could be destroyed, and then
the invaders could trot into Germany on its least
defended side, and take its great ports in the rear,
and raise Cain.
Has anybody, by any chance, heard any-
thing of late re the N.S.W. Ministry’s device
for growing wheat on a big scale, with loan
money and the Government stroke, on the
scrub-lands of Pilliga? Has the inspiration
fallen through, like so many other of Hol-
man’s kittenish schemes? Or has it, like the
compulsory wheat purchase, been handed
over to some wealthy Private Enterprise firm
on a liberal commission?
By “Solomon Malaprop”
The Australian Workers’ Union meets in conven-
tion at Sydney, with over 1200 subjects for discus-
sion. And not even the 1199th subject sets forth
that N.S.W. Labor should stick to its promises that
it would reduce borrowing (it made that promise
when loans were about £3,000,000 per annum), pro-
vide a sinking fund on all old loans, spend new loans
only on works that can pay full interest and sink-
ing fund, and keep the finances square. In fact, the
one thing that is omitted "is the suggestion that the
whole outfit shouldn’t be a political and financial
confidence trick.
According to all the evidence the N.S.W.
Totalisator Bill has dropped down a hqle for
the many dozenth time. The Sydney Govern-
ment. is desperately hard up. But whenever
mention is made of the totalisator, which
would easily yield £200,000 a year, and
which would only be a burden on the useless
and rich and superfluous Private Enterprise
bookmaker instead of on the hard-working
farmer, the way certain prominent politicians
scoff at money is marvellous. Still, nobody
imagines that the useless and rich and super-
fluous Private Enterprise bookie would em-
ploy any form of secret influence to prevent
Socialistic competition, for a person who was
capable of that sort of thing would be a low-
down cove, and quite unfit for the people
now in power to support or associate with.
Of the men who came into office with
McGowen and Holman on October 21, 1910,
only two now hold their original portfolios.
These are Griffith, of the Works or Shirks
Department; and Cohen, who keeps the
pawnshop. . McGowen is a very sick man
these days, and is out altogether; Donald
Macdonell died early; Nielsen was sent away
to inquire into bunions, or something ; Edden,
being less dangerous, had to provide for him-
self; Beeby thought better of it; Trefle, one
of the honoraries in the original team, died
on Monday. That leaves only Holman, who
has changed his job two or three times, and
Carmichael, who was also an honorary, and
has since been two or three other things.
Incidentally, J. R. Dacey has come and gone
the long road; and Cann, Hall, Ashford,
Estell and Hoyle have been dropped into
vacancies. Flowers, the political engineeer
of the team, has been Vice-President of the
Executive Council all the while.
A bungle in connection with the' voting
returns from Dunedin Central (M.L.) shows
a foolish flaw in the Electoral Act. On the
count-up, C. E. Statham, the sitting member,
was declared the winner. Later it transpired
that by a clerical error votes had been accred-
ited to him which rightly should have gone
to. his opponent Munro. These votes clearly
defeated Statham, but there was nothing in
the Act to enable the returning-officer to
eat his words and drop Munro into the seat.
Indeed, Statham could have taken the seat
and urged Munro to get work. Instead, he
resigned; and the election, with all its ex-
pense and recrimination and waste of time,
is to be fought all over again. Furthermore,
the Expedition soldiers, who had a vote
before departing (they probably put Munro
at the head of the poll) are disfranchised
by absence. Wherefore, Statham is likely to
win the seat, and thereby save the Massey
Government from national condemnation—
all because a clerk handed a wad of votes to
the wrong man and there is no legislative
machinery to restore them.
“Adelaide”: About the most notable fea-
ture of modern Adelaide is the commercial
success of side streets. Land values have been
revolutionised, and the cottage residence
makes way for warehouse or factory. The
process is still more observable in the small
area lying between Rundle-street and North
Terrace. Its commercial value took years to
discover, and the doctors’ residences on the-
Terrace backhd on to little bungalows in
gardens. All these are vanishing rapidly,
with five-storey “wholesale houses,” taking
their place. Even the doctors can no longer
—with a few exceptions—afford to live on the
Terrace. The leaders are still required to
hang out the brass-plate there; but the com-
fortable old houses give way to suites of pro-
fessional chambers, and the family lives in
some- handy suburb. Never had a city less
rieecftio huddle than spaciously-designed Adel-
aide, but for over half a century it showed a
foolish tendency to crowd into a mere frag-
ment of what Light indicated as its proper
sphere. Now it is getting more sense—the
long penny electric-tram “sections” have
helped—anch two famous old stories lose their
point. One \was of an old gentleman who
lived on North Terrace, and, being the only
non-medical resident along there, was forced
to move, to avoid the 3 a.m. strangers who
rang his bell and demanded professional
assistance, The other —quite true—con-
cerns the! building which is now the State
Bank. It is merely a reasonable distance
along Pirie-street; but when it was first built
a prominent resident —Conservative brand —
bitterly gave its address to an inquirer as
“away up the Mount Barker-road!”
From Sydney Worker, the official Labor
paper, against which Attorney-General Hall
(of the Labor party) recently got a verdict
for £soo:
Not only was Davy willing to take every penny
he could get from the Union that makes the way of
the political blunderer so hard, but he threatened to
put the bailiffs in if he didn’t get his pound of flesh
with all celerity! This is how his solicitors put it:
Hall v. Australian Workers’ Union.
We have now been instructed to inform you that
the amount due under the judgment herein must be
paid at or before 3 p.m. to-day, Tuesday, failing
which we are to take proceedings without further
notice.
W. M. Hughes, Attorney-General of the
Commonwealth, and David Hall, Attorney-
General of N. S. Wales, who are in such
lw-veless conflict over the N.S.W. wheat
seizure that the matter will have to go to
the courts, learned their law in the same
school, and in much the same circumstances.
Neither knew any until he got into Labor
politics. Till then Hughes had been school-
teacher, umbrella-mender, labor organiser,
anything; Hall was in the Lands Depart-
ment, where he became secretary to a Minis-
ter who didn’t tell him all he knew. At
law Holman and Hall worked together,
helped and encouraged by the deeply-read
D. G. Ferguson, now a Supreme Court
Judge. Holman’s strong point in his student
days (like Hughes, he was in Parliament all
the time) was his astonishing memory and
his capacity for making the most of what
little law.he knew; Hughes (handicapped
then as now by, deafness) relied on his
penetrating brain and his swift absorption
of facts. Hall, the serious-minded man of
the three, and the only one who would be at
home at a Sunday-school anniversary, was
the plodder. Politically he is Holman’s
shadow ; so when Holman was in a position
to do something for him he quitted Federal
politics and accepted a nomination in the
Leg. . Council—exchanged afterwards for a
seat in the. Assembly.
“0.K.” clears everything up:—
As one who holds a brief (instructed by Messrs.
Patriotism and Protection) for Australian Spa Water
versus German ditto, I’d like to give the lie polite
to recent Bulletin paragraphists who have belittled
'the spring at Cooma (N.S.W.). Firstly, “Pick”
(B. 26/11/’l4) said: “When a co. secured the spring
the management dug it out to get down its pumping
plant, and, thenceforward, the bite gradually oozed
out of the water. Chemical treatment is required to
make it twang up to sale standard.” That was a
slander on the quality. But one “Bill Sheep” (B.
31/12/T4) complains not that the virtue of the
■water, but the quantity of it, has diminished, owing
to the “sinking of numerous wells in the locality.”
So attenuated is the flow, according to the wildly
facetious Bill, that when somebody fell- into it he
“hardly even got wet.” The facts pf the case are
these: Private Enterprise was first grknted a lease
of the Cooma Spring in 1900. Boring or tapping
is expressly forbidden to the leaseholders, so the co.
can be trusted to see that' “numerous wells in the
locality” don’t stop the business.' The water flows
from the rock into a basin, and from this the com-
pany draws its supply for bottling. The flow is as
good as ever it was. But the wayfarer who
wants a drink has a grievance: the terms of the lease
prohibit the casual visitor from getting a drink from
the co.’s caretaker, unless he or she "be armed with a
magistrate’s warrant. The Cooma residents are
allowed to get only 10 gallons in all a week from
the spring-house, and no one family can demand
more than one gallon. In excuse, for its horribly
monopolistic lease the Cooma Spa Co. pleads that it
has spent £20,000 in advertising the water, and there
are still some thousands of pounds of outlay to be
worked off. Australia, thus far, is not a patriotic
believer in its own mineral, and tonic waters ; there-
fore the Cooma, which- has to be carried 290 miles
by rail to Sydney, and which is transported from
Sydney to Melbourne and elsewhere by boat, is still
more in need of boosting than the' rather less' health-
ful and palatable bottled waters that come a 12,000
miles journey from Europe.

AN/EMIA
and Debility
IF you are run-down, easily exhausted and out
of breath —if you feel slack, depressed, or
“out-of-sorts,” start a Course of Iron
‘Jelloids’ at once. Iron ‘Jelloids are the
finest and most reliable tonic for all cases of
Anannia or Debility. They quickly restore
vitality, and produce the rich healthy blood so
essential to good health and vigour. Iron
‘Jelloids* are a perfectly safe remedy under
all conditions—pleasant, inexpensive, do not
harm the teeth, and are non-constipating.
Dr. Andrew Wilson wrote: —
“ Itcan be definitely stated that Iron ‘Jelloids
constitute the most effective and desirable
treatment for the cure of that common com-
plaint, that insidious and weakening condition,
no matter from what cause arising, known
as Anaemia pr Poorness of Blood.
A fortnight’s trial (Price 1/6) will convince you
Iron deltoids'

N.S.W. Premier Holman has cabled to a
London paper a New Year’s message to the
effect that we are supporting the Mother-
land unanimously—supporting and comtort-
ing her, in fact, with demands for vast loans
at a time when the old lady has to pour out
money like water in order to keep the
vandals out of her own parlor and her
daughter’s bedroom! Heaven save the
Motherland from many such supporters.
‘‘Jeames” on the two new “Garters” :
The truth of the ancient axiom that there is “no
damned question of merit” in the recipient to dim
the lustre of the K.G.—which is the highest order in
the United Kingdom—finds further proof. Uord
Derby is one of the most commonplace noblemen
imaginable. He is middle-aged, stout and perfectly
respectable. His honesty is something moie than
that which goes with £lO,OOO a year. Tie is an
unimpeachably, upright racing man. whim is the
rarest sort of honest man. When Dick Wootton
brought his libel action against Sievier and got a
farthing damages he called Lord Derby as a witness.
Or it might have been Sievier who called him. The
“heads” all admitted that if Deroy had anything to
say in favor of the one the other was a “goner.”
However, the earl wandered gloomily into the
witness-box, and, in effect, said that he knew no
particular good of either party. He has a lot of
money, and the arrival of his retinue on the course
is one of the features of each Grand National meet-
ing. Knowsley, the chief family seat, is close to
Liverpool.
The Earl of Chesterfield, the other new Garter, is,
in appearance, all that his name implies. Tall, slim,
fine-featured and completely vacuous-looking, he
would, in other circumstances, have made an ideal
A.D.C. No one outside Society had heard of him
till a few years ago, when, becoming hard up, he had
to sell Holme Lacy, his beautiful place in Hereford.
The head of the Tooth family, of Sydney, bought it.
“Raffle”: The Law lias laid a heavy hand
on a Newcastle (N.S.W.) trader in bicycles.
This man offered to anyone who spent ss. in
his shop a chance to name the number of a
certain bicycle, the best guesser to take the
bike. A stern beak, before whom the trader
was presently dragged, lined the cycle-seller
for a fracture of the Gaming Act. Now, 1
sit up to ask for a chart of the position. At,
State-subsidised agricultural shows there are
public gambles on the number of peas in
billies, shot in bottles and such like. Also,
the public is invited to pay a fee and guess
the weight of the bull, the winner to receive
handsome presents. While the Law allows
these things, why its sudden spasm of virtue
over the Newcastle trader? The spasms of
the Law are so rapid that they are frequently
invisible, like the half-Crown Prince of Ger-
many’s value at the front.
A picnic by the Tasman Sea :
What an indomitable soul the picnicker is! He
or she (more often she) makes up her mind during
(say) August that she will picnic (that is, do with-
out shelter, chairs and warm food) on the following
January 1. So when New Year s Day blows along
with its hair-dripping rain, he and she go out
together and sit under the Norfolk Island pines and
watch a yellow-green sea rush up to the Manly
sands like a herd of bilious lions and then fall
down and foam like an army of Germans.
I walked along the sad, wet, misty beach-front, and
saw the last of the New Year's lovers sitting- reck-
lessly on wet grass and gazing into each other's eyes
from under damp fringes. But, damp as they were,
they looked less ruinous than the shivering female
surfer Who was eating a bath bun in the rain. At
least, I think she was eating. Her loose, lank hair
obscured her face; but every time she thrust the
bun into the jungle it came back with another scat.
A party of damp relations were grouped about her,
and each of them in turn begged her not to catch
cold and die. One would have thought people often
did it on purpose. She looked a wildly superfluous
caricature; still they seemed to think it would be, a
misfortune if anything happened to her. She may
have been the Velasquez Venus. Modern disguises
are so perfect.
The whole vast crescent of beach was lined with
other inland family parties, all begging rash washers
not to die and rob the world of beauty and grace.
And in every instance the washer looked so cold and
miserable and- draggled that it seemed impossible
she should ever be dried and reconstructed again.
Far down the open sands a side-whiskered man, his
coat oil and his collar turned up, jumped and staggered
heavily in his efforts to catch a tennis ball. The
feminine part of the group—a huddled mass of
clothes and wrapped food, protected by a black
grenadier of a pine—called shrilly to him to stop it
and come in ; but he and his playmate went on leap-
ing like dogs in the rain.
Back of the beach and the pines the superior
waterfront boarders took their afternoon tea on shel-
tered verandahs and balconies, and stared pityingly
at the voluntary outcasts taking food standing up,
drinking cold tea out of bottles, and urging one
another to over-eat and so get rid of the food they
didn't want to put back in the basket. A shivering,
homeless cur, with a mange spot on his bony head
and a look of mute amazement in his tearful eyes,
drifted along sideways on three thin legs. He was
wondering what bombarded town all the poor
refugees had come from. After him wavered two
silent, grinning drunks with the drifting mist hang-
ing in beads on their red faces, damp but perfectly
happy, walking in a warm dream of alcohol.
The continuous thunder of the stormy sea was
punctuated by a clatter of hoof-beats. The sulky-
owner three pines up had suddenly given up the
struggle to keep his wife, four young children, him-
self and an end of the horse dry with one umbrella.
They pelted away down the wet asphalt at top speed,
the umbrella held low like a shield against the rain.
I hoped, watching the hoof-play of the bounding
horse, that Providence had an angel flying in front
with a red flag.
A party that had been shelterless immediately
swarmed round the vacated pine, and provided more
necks for the drops to fall down. Back under the
shop verandahs damp parties of silent people re-
formed their ranks and shuffled towards the boat
wharf. Drunks and half-drunks emerged from pub
doors like new-hatched moths getting a start in the
world. Whining electric trams with picnickers pro-
truding from them started oft suddenly, and, spitting-
fire, crawled carefully round corners and swept away
down straight stretches of wet road with the rear-
board shouting a last defiance at the angry pic-
nicker who had arrived in time but missed his ’bus
because he lacked the courage to pluck a few
strangers out by the coat-tails and throw his own
encumbrances into the hole thus made. And white-
funnelled ferries plunged to and from Sydney, rolling
their drunken way across the Heads.
Then Night came in from the sea, driving rain-
clouds like cows before her. Flag-halliards snapped
and thrummed in the wind ; and, by the light of the
staring electrics, the staring waxen gent., all ready
dressed for the surf in the bathing-suit shop, looked
a worse lunatic than ever.

The Tragic Romance of a
Coral Island.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
UPON the beach of a lone coral isle,
Ringed by a gentle sea,
A brown girl with a necklace and a
smile
Made coy, faint love to me,
Where eighteen palm trees stood in single
tile
Near one banana tree.
My ship was sitting seaward in the wet
With all her simple crew,
Her two masts and her funnel showing yet
Above the sparkling blue.
A pointed rock had gored her plates and let
The moist Pacific through.
I had. not time to say a single prayer
Before the craft went down,
But as the summer morn was blithe and fair
1 had no heart to drown,
And so I swam to meet that maid whose hair
Was all her simple gown.
High on a beach of crinkled coral white
She brought me things to eat,
And made a palm-leaf bower for my delight
To shield me from the heat;
Her little fingers were as soft and light
As a brown kitten’s feet.
The happy sun was laughing in the sky,
The warm, salt breezes played,
And it was good at happy length to lie
And watch that dimpled maid
Whose velvet lashes over dark eyes shy
Drooped like a window shade.
All weary at her dusky feet I lay,
The world seemed hazy dim,
My wits, perchance, had somewhat gone
astray
After my lengthy swim;
But nothing could my languid soul dismay
Beside a waist so slim.
I drifted far away in happy dreams
To places wild and fair,
Where blue-robed goddesses consumed ice-
creams
In chambers of the air.
And all the day was tangled in bright
streams
Of outblown golden hair ;
And where from smitten harp-strings shrill
and tense
A silver music stole,
Steeping in trembling rapture every sense,
And taking magic toll
Of all that sweet and tropic opulence
Of my unguarded soul.
Delirium, perchance, was* in my veins;
But when my dreams were fled
I found that simple girl had taken pains
To swathe leaves round my head. _
I woke at last with disentangled brains
To find the evening red.
Yes, the large sun was setting in the west
In clouds of tufted fire;
I looked around my waking eyes to rest
Upon my heart’s desire,
And by that maid was standing, all undrest,
Her large and sinewy sire.
lie held a butcher’s chopper in his hand—
A fearsome thing to see;
But all his smiling countenance was bland
The while he looked on me.
Some distance down the white and shining
. strand
The cloth was spread for tea.
A dozen dusky persons squatting near
A fire with driftwood fed
Beneath a pot whose round, dark rim showed
clear
Amid the dancing red.
But no grim thought of treachery or fear
Entered my trusting head.
The pleasant maiden led me to her sire,
And still that parent smiled ;
I understood it was his kind desire
That I should wed his child ;
And everybody sitting round the fire
With sudden joy grew wild.
Then suddenly that tall, stark potentate,
Chief of the dusky tribe,
Uttered a yell of hunger, wrath, or hate
That I can scarce describe ;
I saw myself right up against a fate
I could not bluff or bribe.
He swung his axe against the evening sky
As one of sense bereft.
I saw quite plainly I should have to die
If once my skull were cleft,
And so against the madness in his eye
I poked a useful left.
I made the contact good. He gave a roar.
The meat-axe left liis' hand
And buried its large brightness on the shore
In coral trash and sand,
And then I went for him and gave him more
Till he could hardly stand.
Then I annexed that heavy chopper thing,
And warred on all his race.
I got a dusky corpse at every swing
Till not one grinning face
On all that pleasant island’s coral ring
Had its two halves in place
Except the girl’s. I knew she loved me well.
So when the moon arose
And languid ocean with a fuller swell
Kissed the white island’s toes,
I mentioned in a loud, triumphant yell
What happened to our foes.
She did not answer. All the tropic night
Was very still and deep,
And after the excitement of my fight
I thought it best to sleep;
For all my heart was full of calm delight
And love I knew would keep.
I think that in my happy sleep a smile
Cavorted round my head ;
The axe that late had cleaned up that bright
isle
Lay by me cold and red :
And then that soft, brown damsel came with
guile
And killed me very dead.
Yes, in the middle of a happy dream
She smote my forehead sore.
I lay and let the white moon o’er me stream,
Cold on that pallid shore.
’Twas hard. And yet I really did not seem
To mind things any more.
And on that beach with crinkled coral bright,
In shade or summer heat,
The maiden sits and dreams of lost delignt,
And her dark eyes are sweet;
She fondles half my skull with fingers light
As a brown kitten's feet.

CURSE O' MOSES.
An Olympian Evening.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AT the Olympia. Newtown (Sydney). on
three nights of every week, a £l5OO
tourney rages. It is for boxers
of all weights and sizes and ages and
nationalities and political and religious con-
victions. It has been going on for months.
It may last for years. None of the com-
batants seem clear as to how the £l5OO is to
be allocated, or when. Many of them have no
qualification for the King barring an opti
mistic temperament and an indifference to
physical injury. It says something, either
for the lighting spirit of the race or tor its
epic imbecility, that there should be an end-
less stream of citizens willing to engage each
other furiously, night after night, on the
offehauee of lifting this money or some ot it.
Pusillanimity is so rare that authentic-
instances have developed into classic tales.
A well-known one concerns an up-country
lad who had been “kidded” by his friends
into the belief that he was a champion. Sub-
consciously he seems to have suspicion! d
that lie was nothing of the sort, but then
adulation and his own vanity ultimately
drove him into a metropolitan tournament.
Paced by a person whose ruined nose, cauli-
flower ear, and confident mien told of many
battles, the. young man’s valor entirely aban-
doned him.' At the first - tentative poke of
llie other’s glove he cast himself on his face
and affected to be unconscious. The referee
removed his cigar from his countenance, and
employed it as a baton, while he counted
over the visitor’s motionless form. Suddenly
a hotion struck him that all was not as it
appeared with the stricken one. At “eight”
he absently placed the business end of Ill’s

ing. The ringside interest in the contests is
largely personal. Fathers, brothers, uncles
and others near and dear to the boxers are
on the spot to hearten them, and call atten-
tion to the dastardly tactics of their adver-
saries. Also, school-friends, sparring part-
ners, business acquaintances and enemies.
The latter make most row.
The first couple to climb into the ring are

SKIN
TROUBLES.
SUNBURN, BLISTERS, PRICKLY HEAT, SMARTING
PATCHES, INSECT BITES, ITCH S KINDRED SKIN
TROUBLES PROMPTLY HEALED BY ZAM-BUK.
IN summer the skin is made tender by
excessive perspiration ; and the badness
imprisoned in the tissue, owing to the
sluggishness of the pores, is drawn out in
the form of pimples, rashes and heat swellings.
The strong air of the country or the seaside
does not always suit the skin of the town
dweller, while a change of water frequently
induces a burning irritation and rash that is
even more discomforting than sunburnt and
peeling arms and face, because this irritation
provokes rubbing and scratching, which opens
the way for eczema or some poisoned sore.
The best check to these skin troubles is the
regular use of Zam=Buk, which is a pure skin balm.
For removing that tingling irritation known as
Summer Itch, or Prickly Heat, Zam=Buk is invaluable.
Zam-Buk is also highly recommended for taking the sting and smarting
out of insect bites, for it not only soothes pain, but counteracts any
poison that may have been introduced into the system.
has achieved a r/orld-wide reputation for purity and
effectiveness,
EVERY HOME NEEDS ZAM-BUK.
SUMMER RASH.
Mrs. L. Switzer, of Ethel Street, Eor-
restville, Adelaide, says: “Overheating - of
the blood caused a nasty rash to break
out at different periods on the back of
my neck. This was very irritable, and it
was a matter of difficulty to keep my
hands from it. My mother, who always
used Zam-Buk in the home, recommended
me to try this balm. I did so, and in a
short time the rash was completely
ended.
“My sister has also been cured of skin
eruptions by Zam-Buk.”
SUNBURN CAUSED BLISTERS.
Mrs. A. Lamplough, of High Street,
Chelmer Hill, Mount Morgan (Q.), says:
“‘One da.v during the holidays my boy*
who had been swimming, complained of
a nasty pain on his back and shoulders;
On examining him 1 found that the sun
had biujnt him sd badly that the skin was
hanging in water blisters, and the poor
lad could not bear the weight of his
clothes on him. After picking the blisters
1 applied Zam-Buk all over his back, and
in a week the smarting and soreness had
quite gone away.”
For all Summer Skin Troubles, as well as the minor everyday
accidents that happen in every home, Zam-Buk is invaluable.

“You Will Be Astonished
How It Removes Wrinkles.”
TOILET TALKS;
SIMPLICITY is the order of the day as
regards beauty culture. Many women
regularly visit the specialist to have their
wrinkles ironed out with the help of hot
applications, cold creams and massage.
Most of us realise that there comes a time
when no amount of persuasion of this sort
will, avail. This process of “wrinkle remov-
ing is wrong in principle. Both
the hot water and the massag-
ing tend to expand and loosen
the skin, besides softening the
muscular foundation. The verv
opposite result should be aimed
at. The tissue should be strength-
ened and the skin tightened to
smooth out the wrinkles. For
this purpose ordinary parsidium
jelly, obtainable at all chemists,
may be used with beneficial
effects. Get about one shilling’s-
worth and apply like cold cream.
The face will quickly look years
younger.
IT is astonishing the number of women
whose faces show a more or Less pro-
nounced growth of superfluous hair, and it
is much to be regretted that through ignor-
ance, or wrong treatment, the majority of
them have made matters considerably worse
by causing the hairs to grow more quickly
and stronger than before. It only requires
a little thought to realise the folly of it all.
Removing the surface growth for a few days
may give temporary relief, but in order to
obtain permanent results the hair roots
must be killed. Caustic depilatories are
worse than useless, and on no account
Ã
should the hairs be pulled out. Apart from
the electric needle, which is a costly and
painful process, any chemist will tell you
that the most reliable home treatment is
pure powdered pheminol. This substance
has a devitalising effect upon the hair roots,
in addition to which it removes all trace of
the objectionable hair in a few seconds. The
recommended treatment gradu-
ally, but surely, dissolves out the
hair follicles, which is the only
method of permanently ridding
oneself of this embarrassing
disfigurement.
HOW often do you see one
of the old-fashioned pow-
der pots on your friend’s dress-
ing table? Not very frequently,
lam sure. Thev are fast being
converted to a more useful pur-
pose. The truth of the matter
is, women are at last beginning
to realise that powder is the
“root of all evil” as far as their
complexions are concerned, at any rate, and
are wisely discarding the powder puff
for that ordinary, innocent-looking sub-
stance known as deminite. What they
do is to obtain about an ounce from
their chemist and dissolve it in four table-
spoonfuls of water. This gives a lotion
which immediately imparts a delightful
bloomy appearance to the skin; removes that
horrid greasy appearance, and renders pow-
dering quite unnecessary. The result lasts
all day long under the most trying condi-
tions, and what is far mote important, im-
proves the complexion instead of ruining it. [5
The "Swan-Safety” is simpler and more reliable than any
other pen made; may be carried in any position, in any pocket,
handbag or trunk, without fear of leakage: with the "ladder”
feed, erratic working is out of the question; the nib is the
product of over 60 years’ experience; the holder is beautifully
balanced and holds a good supply of ink.

his lien on the £1500; and is promptly
dropped again. He listens to the count with
his fair top-not sweeping the floor and a
look on his face as though he desired pas-
sionately to be otherwhere. The gong sounds
and the parties retire to their corners to be
resuscitated. But it is all over as regards
the possessor of the hair. The other has
gained a moral dominance. lie advances
llat-footedMo the slaughter. The dull brown
thud of a wallop on the jaw resounds
through the building; the liair-specialist in
the front row moans again; his relative or
colleague in the ring gives suddenly in all
his joints. When the audience looks up,
from setting fire to its tobacco, an inanimate
form is being removed from a milieu where
it should never have obtruded itself.
Welters follow. One wears a violent
green sash to show he is of Irish
descent; the other affects a ruined pair of
bathing trunks and burst boots, to indicate
that there is no pride about him, or from
motives of economy. Australia produces an
extraordinary collection of vigorous boys of
10 stone and upwards. The writer went to
a recent Amateur Boxing Tournament with
one who had promoted such shows all over
the United Kingdom, and the visitor assured
him that the physique of youngsters here—-
more especially between 10 and 11 stone —
is 25 per cent, better than in Britain. He
put it down to (1) superior food, (2) the
surfing habit.
To resume, the combatants wade into each
other like furies. Neither of them fancies
himself as a scientific boxer, but both own
punches that have proved themselves in the
strenuous past. The crash of glove connect-
ing with nose and so forth is heard. Blood
flies. Likewise, hair, skin and teeth. An
aged man uprises in the distance and im-
plores someone to use his straight left. The
parties do not hear him and continue to use
everything pretty well barring their feet.
A scream of joy denotes that the Irishman
has been smitten in the stomach. The
round ends in a tornado of conflict, and the
next one begins similarly. But this sort of
thing cannot last. Such battles go to the
posesssor of the final ounce of endurance.
In this case it is the young man in the
burst boots. After being knocked through
the ropes twice running, and only saved
from landing on his head on the press table
"Hooray Janesy—Right in the hash-house !”
by the. reporters ; after being felled several
times in the middle of the ring; and after
sustaining other injuries, the Hibernian is
in a bad way and his towel is thrown in.
For the first time during the disturbance,
he loses his temper. Harsh words are
uttered. He is led below, explaining to those
whom he evidently regards as false friends
that in another two or three rounds the
£l5OO would have been within his reach.
Mild applause greets the heavyweights.
One is a likely-looking customer, with the
arms of a wharf-lumper and a local reputa-
tion as a smiter. His adversary is the sort
of athlete who was at the top of his form
10 years previously. He is in condition,
but his hair is thin, and there are lines
about his eyes. Not to put too fine a point
on it, he is a physical has-been. He boxes his
hefty rival with the skill of a practised
hand. He has all the hits. The harbor-
sider is crossed, uppercut, speared with a
straight left, and maltreated in the other
regulation fashions. But Age stands grimly
Age waits with a raised are.
by with raised axe throughout the proceed-
ings. The effect is not so much pathetic as
ludicrous. An elderly man appears to worse
advantage in a boxing ring, perhaps, than
anywhere else. When his condition fails,
everything fails. Ilis skill goes, likewise
his nerve and his resolution. He disinte-
grates and is ripe for destruction.
The wharf-lumper moves ponderously on
his prey. He aims a swipe that might re-
move a normal human being’s head if it
landed. The representative of 19th century
pugilism side-steps it with a smile, sickly
from apnrehension. And then the other
lands. Why go into the details? The oldster
continues with misguided courage, till worn
and dazed he leaves himself so wide open
that even his blundering opponent is able
to make good. There is a smack that might
be heard in the Newtown-road and a gallant
idiot is carried away to his pained family.
Tii c readiness with which the entries
come in for these shows is an effective
answer to those who accuse the Young Aus-
tralian of the tired feeling. There can be
no hope of money in the business as regards
many hundreds of the competitors. They
battle for the love of it. For that, and for
the brief riot in the limelight which actors
and politicians and Governors are able to
command as often as they wish, and with-
out any likelihood of injury. For days and

weeks and months a procession of perfectly

They have to be cool, courageous and self-
controlled or go under in a landslip of
humiliation. The political or religious con-
troversialists who could endure the assaults
of _ tlieir opponents with the philosophic
amiability of these young men would edify
the world. Their presence in the Ring pre-
supposes a beerless, and in other respects
moral life. Governments have subsidised
less desirable institutions, from a national
standpoint, than these eliminating tourneys.
