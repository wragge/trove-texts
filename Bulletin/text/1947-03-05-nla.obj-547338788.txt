great cathedral of St. Colman dominates the city that was
once known as Cove of Cork. Queen Victoria visited here in
1849, and, thereafter in honour of that royal visit, the place has
been called Queenstown. St. Colman’s, one of Ireland’s finest
ecclesiastical buildings, was begun jn the year 1868 and consecrated
in 1919. As well as this edifice, A. W. N. Pugin designed many
notable buildings throughout the British Isles, but this is one of his
masterpieces. Queenstown, a famed yachting centre, is one of the
favoured holiday resorts of Southern Ireland, and was the site of
an important naval station.

ART AND ACCIDENT.
Kylie Tennant’s Lost Haven (Mac-
millan), Eleanor Dark’s Waterway (F. H.
Johnston Cos., Ltd.) and C. F. Ramuz’s
The Triumph of Death (Routledge) are
all novels in which the climax depends
on an accident, so that the way in which
the boiler explosion, the ferry collision
and the destruction of the earth are
handled makes a convenient test of the
writers’ artistry. For accidents, which
have a way of happening pointlessly, are
awkward material for art.
Ramuz’s accident —of cosmic dimen-
sions—is witnessed from a rustic
suburb in the author’s native coun-
try, the canton of Vaud in French
Switzerland. The incredible news is re-
ceived —“Something has happened to the
law of gravity. The earth is rapidly fall-
ing towards the sun, rushing to rejoin it.”
And, of .course, it is not believed. There
has been a great drought, the earth has
begun to crack and the grass to yellow,
but —
The single wheel of the wheelbarrow
turns the same as it did yesterday and in
the same way as it will tomorrow. The
wheel of the barrow squeaks.
But things begin to happen. There is
an ugly scene in a caffi where a man,
shouting warnings, is angrily silenced.
Troops begin to parade the streets.
There is “anew kind of sunset, anew
color, anew light.” Trains cease run-
ning. There is looting; and, soon, as
the taste for destruction grows, murder ;
then revolution:
Nothing can stop us doing what we
want to do, do you all hear, from today
on, nothing. But let’s get going.
Life, in a horrible white fog of heat,
becomes orgiastic and bloody. And
through the enshrouding steam the figures
of men and women loom monstrous.
Sometimes in prose one encounters a
power of vivid projection in which the
novel transcends its limitations, becom-
ing intense and visionary like poetry,
clear like painting, statuesque like sculp-
ture. It is a quality* to be found in the
barbaric woman, Kurtz’s mistress, in
Conrad’s “The Heart of Darkness,” and
again in the picture of Singleton in The
Nigger of the Narcissus when the old
seaman, after his great feat of endurance
at the wheel, suddenly collapses from ex-
haustion. John Cowper Powys similarly
made sculpture of his prose when he
crucified Geard in The Glastonbury
Romance; as did Trollope—how full of
surprises that quiet man is! —when he ex-
hibited that wonderful shrew, Mrs.
Proudie, struck dead from heart-failure,
erect, clutching the bedpost. Ramuz does
this sort of thing twice in The Triumph
of Death, once when he shows a fisher-
man drinking—a gigantic figure full of
life in a lake of the dead —and again
when a youth in the midst of a revolu-
tionary crowd climbs on a table and lifts
his girl high in the air and then is shot
down—a symbol of the mob’s ferocious
hatred and envy of anything that lifts
itself above its own seething mass:
There she is up there with her long hair
that began to fall down, her head thrown
back, her shoulders hollowing in.
Then: bang! a single gun shot.
The boy and the girl tumbled down to-
gether. The mass below rose slightly as
though to receive what was falling, and
which was re-engulfed. Nothing now.
When the waves come, following one
another, without overreaching: because all
are together, all are of the same height,
are they not? and equal. He had no right,
it was well done. They laughed.
An airman, yet another of Ramuz’s
symbolic figures, tries, like Icarus,
to fly right away from the earth,
and is driven back by the heat above to
the inferno below. Little republics are
set up in the villages to preserve what
water, food and shelter are left; but no-
whera is there safety. And at last, with
a futile bit of killing on the mountain
tops, the drama is concluded, the very
last page suggesting that, after all, there
remains hope for men—or some of them
—in eternity.
The Triumph of Death is not exactly
what one would call a happy book.
Though it was written in 1925—this is
the first English translation —it j s all a
little too relevant to atomic warfare for
comfort. In fact, one would be glad to
escape from it to Kylie Tennant’s “lost
haven,” which, by comparison, has all
the homely security of a hollow log—
with a pleasant aroma of cabbage at one
end and of seaweed at the other. But,
considering it purely as a work of art,
and disregarding all except the develop-
ment of its theme, it is obvious that
Ramuz has handled his cosmic accident
with beautiful assurance.
The accident in Lost Haven is of an
altogether different order. After an im-
mensely complicated story, set on the
north coast of New South Wales but with
something of an American flavor, of the
family feuds of sawmillers and fisher-
men, Kylie Tennant presents a fisher-
man, his illegitimate daughter and her
lover in a deserted sawmill on a dirty
night. It is obvious that something is
going to blow up ; \and, in fact, the boiler
does. And kills the fisherman.
It is certainly a useful accident. The
fisherman’s life wifh his Jamaica is ended,
the daughter is frightened back to the
city, and the lover (with whom she was
about to elope) is left to drift into a
state of idiocy. So the book ends
in a way that is becoming the set pat-
tern for Kylie Tennant’s novels; for
the novelist has only to allow a third
female, Benison —a busy little body in-
distinguishable from Shannon in Ride On,
Stranger and Bessie in Time Enough
Later —also to drift back to the city, and
then we have, instead of the usual bevy
of brides that round off a novel, three
jolly spinsters. Though, indeed, there is
some hope that Benison (and Shannon
and Bessie) will marry an elderly gentle-
man she met in a library and so disap-
pear for ever from Kylie Tennant’s
novels.
A useful accident; but not, one feels,
inevitable. Is it to be regarded as the
doom that falls on the fisherman
for his amatory error long, long
ago? Is it to shock a shallow girt
into the realisation of the depth of life?
Is it necessary to show the girl what is
obvious to the reader from the moment
she meets him, that she could never marry
her lover? Is it the natural conclusion
of the feud between the fisherman and
another man with whose wife he is liv-
ing? Is the fisherman’s death self-sought?
Or, since he saves his daughter and her
Iqyer, the right ending for a devoted
parent and a generous friend?
Or does the accident just happen point-
lessly, the way—despite Freud—accidents
do happen sometimes in life? If Kylie
Tennant means the explosion to be
merely a freak of fortune, she has not,
as Conrad did in Chance, modulated
even the caprice of destiny into an artistic
design. If she means it to be the crisis
of one or other or all of the tangled
themes in her book she has not made the
development either clear or powerful
enough to justify the scene. And so the
total effect bf the novel, disregarding all
else but the basic construction, is not
of drama, but of melodrama, not of
crisis but of muddle.
Eleanor Dark’s accident comes more
smoothly into her story. And it is,
moreover, the most interesting event in
Waterway which, located at . Watson’s
Bay on Sydney Harbor, consists for the
most part of immensely long meditations
on sociology and philosophy, in the inter-
vals of which a husband, wife and
widower work out a triangle situation, a
girl, loved by a rich man’s son and a
Leftist journalist, works out another
triangle, a philosopher faces a sentence
of death from a doctor, and a sort of
Bottom Dog goes about darkly barking.
The situations are worked out in one
day, at the end of which all the char-
acters are either in or deeply interested
in a ferry accident —clearly a parallel to
the Greycliffe disaster: —
He trod water, choking, feeling sick, and
grabbed at something floating past him. It
was a broken bit of one of the ferry seats,
and he clung to it, gasping, thought and
sight returning, and looked about him.
The Neptune, inconceivably vast, towered
away above him towards the sky, its railing
lined with shouting and gesticulating people.
As he Watched a man dived from it, and
Bobby became aware for the first time
that the water was dotted with the heads
of struggling people as well as with bits
of broken wood and debris from the shat-
tered ferry. He noticed, too, with a queer
sense of astonishment that familiar objects
such as bags and hats and folded news-
papers looked unbelievably strange when
you saw them floating in the water.
Eleanor Dark has missed a chance
here for a piece of “sculptural” writing
like the great moments in Ramuz’s novel
for she writes: —
Through such windows as were open,
and through the door, green water was
rushing in upon them. When the Profes-
sor struggled to his feet....he stared into
a face quite insane with fear. He clutched
for support at the top of the door, now
leaning diagonally above him, and suddenly
Arthur’s feet drove violently against his
stomach, using his body to provide the
necessary impetus for a frantic upward
dive through the narrow aperture.
And this, it would seem, a man in the
extremity of terror saving his life by
drowning another, is an opportunity for
an unforgettable image. But Arthur, a
wealthy businessman, is the villain
throughout the book and is so harshly
treated by the author at all times that one
cannot quite believe in. him as a char-
acter. This is not mere partisanship, for
tne Bottom Dog is drawn in the same
harsh, sketchy, cartoon-like style so that
he, too, when he reaches his peak of action
and hurls a bottle at a rich man in a
car, is not quite credible. Though 1 two
women, an artist and a wealthy old lady,
are pleasantly drawn, most of Eleanor
Dark’s characters, because of her
“clinical” style and because she uses the
psycho-analytical method, seem like in-
setts before a microscope, specimens in
a vast cold dissecting-room ; and these
two, Arthur and Jack Saunders, are like
cartoons in a Leftist newspaper, lay-
figures labelled Capitalist and Worker.
There are, of course, no such animals.
Still, such as he is, Arthur does come
to his climax in the ferry accident, and
so do all the characters and all the situ-
ations. And thus, though the accident
is not integrally related to the people’s
lives (as it would be, say, to the
crew and officers of the two ships),
it is “near enough.” The accident
has, moreover, a certain * mystical
inevitability, for Waterway was written
before The Timeless Land and in the
earlier novel Eleanor Dark touches on a
theme that was developed in the later —
the violence immanent in the Australian
earth. Perhaps this notion of a special
ferocity of climate and soil in Australia
is an illusion, for New Zealand can do
pretty well with storm and earthquake,
England with gale and snow. Yet ex-
tremes of heat may be more intolerable,
more nerve-wracking than cold ; and at
any rate the theory is legitimate, and
plausibly argued in Waterway.
And, because it moves more or less
naturally towards the accident —because,
in a word, it is well constructed — Water-
way • is not only a better work of art, in
this respect, than Lost Haven, but it is
infinitely easier reading.
All Kylie Tennant's novels, you might
say, read like first novels. Though the
novelist has masqueraded at times as a
stem social realist—no doubt out of a
genuine conviction that she is—her writ-
ing has always been essentially “roman-
tic,” using that word to mean simply
that she has a delight in the richness
of life. Whether it is slums, country
towns, Sydney bohemianism or, as in
Lost Haven, a remote community of
fishermen, she sees a new kind of food
to appease her hunger for life, and —
eagerly, impetuously, youthfully—she
rushes in and chops it up and lumps it
together and stirs it and seasons it with
everything she can think of and offers
it, half-burned and half-raw, to the
reader. With the most admirable energy
and industry, with joy and goodwill, she
gathers the material for a first-class novel
—and makes a hash of it.
The publishers, no doubt in despera-
tion,* suggest that Lost Haven is about the
busy little Benison, who is “looking for
a niche for herself in life.” That is partly
true, and to the extent that it is. Lost
Haven is a repetition of Ride on, Stranger
and Time Enough Later, and is yet an-
other of those Kylie Tennant novels
which, again in desperation, are described
as “picaresques.” The picaresque, tradi-
tionally, consists of the adventures of
a travelling eccentric or rogue —Don
Quixote or Gil Bias; travel and a color-
ful central character, or group of
characters, are its essentials. Kylie Ten-
nant came close enough to this tradi-
tion in The Battlers/ but the later novels,
pursuing the dumpy figure of Bessie or
Shannon or Benison —a central character
at the best dull and, to the present re-
viewer, maddening; and certainly sane
and “good”—are very far removed from
the works of Apuleius, Rabelais, Cer-
vantes or Fielding,
But Lost Haven is only partly con-
cerned with Benison. It is about the
village of Lost Haven; about everything
.that happens or could happen to its
fishermen, sawmillers, slygroggers, amor-
ists, assorted loons and larrikins. And
this, its greatest fault as a work of art,
is also its greatest attraction. For, if you
take Lost Haven slowly, reading for its
incidental merits and ignoring the stum-
bling construction, it will give you more
pleasure than either Waterway or The
Triumph of Death; more of the richness
of life.
For Ramuz is excellent only within
limits. Called “the Cezanne of literature”
—and, like Cezanne, praised by earnest
moderns for his faults, because what is
“different” is esteemed as necessarily
good—he has indeed some of the limita-
tions of the painter. He writes cryptic-
ally—perhaps because he cahnot make
himself clear ; he writes short sentences
—perhaps because he cannot construct
long ones. He has, like Walt Whitman,
a disconcertingly naive habit of shouting
out “Hullo, there!” to all the world;
a habit like Hemingway (“You did your
work”) of madly muttering to himself
about his technique as he goes along—
“We are going to set down all that is
there, and nothing that is not there” ; and
a perfectly absurd trick, reminiscent of
Wyndham Lewis’s descriptions of the
movements of his characters’ bones in
The Apes of God, of presenting his
people like dislocated bodies in a surreal-
ist painting, an arm or a leg or an ear
appearing in isolation as it comes into
his range of vision—the “prize example is
a picture of a man jumping over a
crevice; “Right up to and over that first
large crevice which lies across the road,
his head crossing first and then his feet.
And above all he is like Cezanne in an
affectation of peasant thick-headedness—
no doubt genuine in Cezanne, who com-
plained bitterly in his letters about his
own “stupidity,” but false, one feels,
in Ramuz.
He' surpasses the Australian writers
precisely where a wooden-skulled peasant
could not —in the range of his imagina-
tion ; and he falls short, curiously, just
where might be expected to succeed,
in characterisation.
Certainly, Ramuz has not attempted to
make individual characters in The
Triumph of Death ; and the book “works'’
without them. But works within limits.
Fantasies about the end of the world
are not so very uncommon after all. In
fact, Marjorie Barnard wrote one quite
as good as Ramuz's, only shorter—her
“Dry Spell,” printed by Cecil- Mann in
the first Coast to Coast. And even if
both these fantasies can be called un-
commonly good, it is great characterisa-
tion that lasts longest in literature and
that most enriches the mind of man. If
you could care individually for the people
in* The Triumph of Death, the book
would be ten tiflies as moving. It suc-
ceeds now, in a time of fear of atomic
warfare, by a kind of emotional black-
mail ; but in a period free from that
threat it might read very tamely. It is a
“period piece” ; we happen to be living
in its period.
Kylie Tennant’s characters could not
be called great; they move, they develop
too uncertainly. But they are brilliant in
a static, impressionistic way, like the
better sort of modernist paintings ; crude,
hasty, but, in a broad and gaudy way,
effective. Whereas Eleanor Dark’s
Worker and Capitalist are cartoons and
her Mrs. Trugg a comic charlady out
of “Punch” —this novelist is happy only
with middle-class intellectuals —Kylie
Tennant can give their full humanity
alike to simple fishermen and boat-
builders, to a rich and miserly old
property-owner and to the robust and
Rabelaisian Jamaica. There are shoals of
people in her fishing village—lost shoals
(as well as lost souls)- —but all alive ; and
most of them behaving with a delightful
disregard for the conventions. As, not so
delightfully, does Kylie Tennant’s prose
at times ; if people must “wamble” and
drowning men must say “Oopoopworple,’
well, they must, even if it is an immature
sort of humor; but there is no need for
waves, in serious description, to “wop.
Especially as Kylie Tennant, muddled in
construction, uncertain in the develop-
ment of characters promisingly set down,
is at her best in descriptive passages; in
“atmosphere.”
And it is this, more than the charac-
terisation, that makes Lost Haven the
richest of the three books surveyed here.
Ramuz’s landscape is good, but sketchy
—Cezanne, after all, could not paint like
Gruner or Streeton ; Eleanor Dark’s is
good, but chilly—her Watson’s Bay is not
the warm, lavish Watson’s Bay oi
Christina Stead’s For Love Alone; but
Kylie Tennant’s landscape and seascape
—when the waves are not “wopping” and
when Benison refrains from philosophis-
ing about “a half-evolved organism oscil-
lating dizzily on the point of a balance’
(an extraordinarily difficult feat for a
half-evolved organism)—leaves nothing
to be desired:
It was moonlight, and flood-tide icy
Mack and cold, as Hippie O’Shea made
his way towards the curved spit of land
known as Suderman’s Horn. From the
roaring white bar the sea flowed in up-
channel, past the mile-long walls of oyster-
bitten rock, to lap round the funnel of the
sunken tugboat. Innumerable ditches and
dykes drank in the cold saltwater and drew
it inland through the grass. There was a
stirring and burrowing of red-nippered
crabs in the mangrove swamps, a rustling
of millions of tiny lives adjusting themselves
to one more great thud of the earth -
pulse. All the enormous stretch of marsh
and sand-dune, swamp and forest, listened
to the whisper of the tide, as it came
licking -about the fins of Mack shadow on
which the mountain reared its bulk above
Abraham’s Bosom.
This is beautiful writing; and pro-
found ; and simple. In just one respect
it resembles the character of Benison—
there is no nonsense about it. No oop-
oopworple. And there is enough of the
lovely rich landscape to make the book,
taking in the best of the portraiture, the
totality of the village of Lost Haven, k
is like a big net bulging with fish and
fishermen. But a bulge is not a very
beautiful shape; a net is not quite the
same thing as a novel, as the term is
properly understood and as Eleanor
Dark and Ramuz understand it. Those
two make an accident into art; Kylie
Tennant makes art an accident.

When and by whom was the Spit Bridge,
Sydney, built? Who owns it how, and when
did the toll system cease?
The wooden bridge across the Middle Har-
bor at the Spit was built in 1924 by the Syd-
ney Harbor Trust for the Manly Municipal
Council. Tolls were levied to defray the
cost. In 1930, when expenses had been paid
in full, the bridge was transferred to the
Government.

Where and when was the Cutty Sark built
and what is the meaning of the name?
She was built by Scott and Linton, of
Dumbarton, to the design of Hercules Linton,
a member of the firm, for Capt. John Willis,
and was launched November 23, 1869, by
Mrs. Moodie, the wife of her first captain.
The name literally means “short shirt,” from
the abbreviated garment worn by the figure-
head, a representation of the beautiful Witch
Nannie spied by Tam o’ Shanter on the witches’
Hallowe’en revels.

How to treat black spot and mildew in
roses ?
As soon as black spot is noticed spray with
Bordeaux mixture (bluestone-lime), which is
sold by plant merchants. Pick off all leaves
and hum them, and also wash the stems with
the mixture. Mildew is a fungus disease always
aggravated by excessive watering or following
heavy rain. \ Some varieties are affected by
fungus; and in districts where the trouble is
always met with it is better to replace them.
Spray the leaves and the stems with lime-
sulphur (Harbas) in late afternoon to allow
it to stick to the leaves, and next day’s sun
will help in the clean-up. The treatment should
be done at intervals of two weeks.

Treatment for pot-plants, palms and ferns
which show yellowed foliage after being used
indoors ?
Immerse the pots in a bucket of water (in
which a little sulphate of ammonia has been
dissolved) for an hour, then lift out to drain.
They should be placed in a conservatory or
under a tree for at least a month. Badly
affected plants must be repotted, using equal
parts of light loam, pulverised cow manure
and sand. If plant lice are noticed add a little
crushed bluestone to the water. Until these
potted plants show vigorous growth they should
not be used indoors.

Is it within the rules for a batsman to change
from left- to right-handed batting during an
innings or during an over?
This is not covered in the Laws of Cricket,
but the M.C.C. has ruled that the matter
could come within the definition of fair and
unfair play, and in those circumstances the
umpire could rule against a batsman changing
from right-hand to left-hand during an innings.
The decision would depend on the circum-
stances.

THE INCEPTION OF A GREAT BUSINESS . . .
F. 1816, in the quiet, rural county of Essex, Samuel Courtauld, the
principal founder of the present firm, set up his first premises for
the manufacture of silk, and the business prospered despite upheavals
following the end of the Napoleonic wars.
Samuel and his brothers specialised in making mourning crape, and
by the time of the death of the Prince Consort they were acknowledged
masters in the production of this material.
Long before Courtaulds became concerned with the manufacture of
rayon, their fine silks had a world-wide distribution and were shipped
to Australia from mid-Victorian times onwards.

LOGAN RIVER
No. 11 of "The Cookabundy Chronicles"
BY BRAIN JAMES
IT was early
January and the
thresher was
buzzing away at
Emil Schneider’s big
round stacks. Emil
had found it hard
enough to get a team
—fifteen men in all
—for the threshing
machine.
Most of the team
was made up of
locals, farmers from
near by, and there
were only two “permanents,” Bill John-
son the engineer and the feeder, Abe
Newton.
The locals were old Adolf Himmelman,
conspicuous and useless ; old Jim Bower,
Hoffy, Windy Holt, and several others
equally useless if not so noticeable.
On the straw stack was Billy Barton
—good man Billy, and not a better
builder of straw stacks anywhere. With
him was a chap named Tom Travers.
No one knew much about him —only that
he came from “Queensland somewhere.”
Queer fellow, they reckoned him; never
said much to anyone, sly and furtive
he looked; and his white moustache and
white eyebrows and faded, blue, expres-
sionless eyes didn’t invite confidence at
all. Just why, it would be hard to say.
Only a young fellow really—in his late
twenties—but he didn’t mix with the
chaps of his own age—seemed too old
for that.
As far as a fellow like Travers could
get on with anyone, he and Billy Barton
rubbed along together.
It was fairly late on Saturday after-
noon when the job cut out, and Emil
rubbed his hands at the sight of the big
stacks of bags, just under four hundred
of them. Emil paid the “casuals” and
brought forth a generous quantity of
wine in demijohns.
There was much good-fellowship and
loud talk and laughter over the wine,
with a “hard case” pretending to have
too much.
How it started was never too clear, but
out of the babel and pleasantry came an
angry voice and a snarl.
Then old Adolf Himmelman and Tom
Travers were seen in unequal combat.
There was something so horribly incon-
gruous about the fight that it did not
arouse the enthusiasm a fight generally
does.
The rest just stared without realising
for some seconds when Billy Barton
stepped out and said “Stop it!”
Travers didn’t; he struck old Adolf a
cruel blow —a most unnecessary blow —on
the chin. Billy grabbed Travers and
nearly threw him against the straw stack.
But Travers turned on Billy with “You,
too!” Billy just said two words and
Travers stopped short. The fight was
over as quickly as it had begun.
Old Adolf wasn’t a pretty sight with
blood on his nose and beard, but he
wasn’t much hurt. But it was an ugly
incident, look at it as you would. Tom
Travers was a young active man, power-
ful, too, though-he was not outstandingly
big. Adolf was old and, as usual, fuddled.
An unequal fight has something foully
wrong and brutal in it. Still, no one
was anxious to say much —Travers looked
too capable altogether, and in his present
mood perhaps only too ready. It had
remained for Billy Barton to interfere.
In a way Billy scored a silent point for
that. __
T” HERE was a cloud thrown over the
_ revelry and easy good-feeling; the
wine lost something of its taste and con-
sequently a lot more of it was drunk.
Someone brought Adolf a billy of
water and with it, aided by a very
doubtful-looking rag, Adolf cleared up
most of the mess. He didn’t comment on
the fight at all, seemed to have forgotten
what if was all about; and he seemed
anxious to wash down the memory of it
with a good quantity of Emil’s wine.
As for Travers —morose in his usual
mood, almost sinister and certainly taci-
turn —a queer change came over him. It
may have been the wine—he was pouring it
down freely enough—but now he became
jovial in a way that didn’t sit right upon
him. Anyway, it was rotten taste to
joke about the fight and make light and
little of it —even if he did so in an
apologetic fashion, declaring himself a
hotheaded fool. It was all wrong, and by
no means appreciated.
Stranger still, Le and Billy Barton were
friendly again. Billy was never one to
harbor ill-feeling, but he could hardly
admire Travers, especially as he had been
the only one ready to take old Adolf’s
part.
The sun was sinking into the summer
haze of heat and dust and the party
was breaking up. At the straw stack
were left 01% those who would stay
while any wine remained —Adolf, Jim
Bower, Billy Barton. With them stayed
Tom Travers. No doubt Emil Schneider
would have preferred to see them go, but
Emil could be easy enough in some ways,
and in any case the threshing was done
and one could afford to overlook things
a bit.
They made a strangely assorted com-
pany, these four, and one might wonder
where the points of real contact and
sympathy came in. Not that they didn’t
talk freely enough—it rapidly developed
into gabbling, thick and incoherent, but
the only thing in common seemed the
wine.
As darkness closed in, puffs of air,
cool and sweet, blew over them. The
fight was a thing of ages ago now, unreal
and dimly remembered. On the straw
tailus of the stack, no longer brittle and
crackling in the night air, they sprawled
and slept.
A big yellow moon at last crept over
the Cookabundy Ranges and solemnly
looked at the four. Billy Barton stirred.
stared back at the
moon rather owlishly
and declared he was
going home, Tom
Travers woke at the
same time and said
“Another drink,
Billy, and we’ll go
together.”
They started off
across the stubble
and Chinese burrs,
weaving a rather
crooked course and
leaning on each
other for support.
It wasn’t Travers’s way home at all,
but he explained that he would see that
Billy didn’t fall down the “diggesh
sholes.” Billy thought it a good idea, for
he would be able to see that Tom didn’t
fall down the “diggesh sholes,” too.
Then they started to sing “Annie Laurie”
—or at least a very thick version of it.
To the soulful singing Jim Bower and
Adolf Himmelman awoke.
“ ’Dolf,” said Jim, “do you know I’ve
been thinking?!” Jim ran his tongue
round his lips. “ ’Dolf, I heard what
Billy Barton said to Tom. He said
‘Logan River.’ Just ‘Logan River,’ ’Dolf.
What do you think of that?”
Adolf didn’t say what he thought.
“’S funny, ’Dolf. That’s what I say
—’s funny. Them two words just
stopped Tom. He was mad enough to
kill, and them two words stopped him —
’s funny, ’Dolf, that’s what I say.”
“Maxwelton braes” were being bonny
for the third time and beginning to fade
away in the distance. Jim and Adolf
went off to sleep again.
ON Monday morning work started
early on Billy Rosen’s stacks. Billy
Rosen was greatly excited, for he had
been depending on Barton to build the
straw stack, and Barton hadn’t arrived.
He blamed Emil Schneider for filling him
up with wine.
When Roly Hawkins, the butcher, was
passing, Bill gesticulated wildly and en-
listed Roly on a doubtful mission to
Billy Barton.
“Tell him. Roly, to come down at once
and that he’s sacked when he does get
here for not being here.”
About two hours later Roly was seen
returning— at a gallop, cart locking and
bumping along. As Billy Rosen after-
wards described it, “enough to turn all
the meat into butter.”
Roly was face and excited.
“Billy Barton’s dead in his hut!” He
didn’t yell it, either; he couldn’t —just
got it out with his mouth working round
with dryness.
Billy Rosen’s presence of mind was
superb —he got a bottle of Chablis from
under the wet bag in the shade of the
oak-tree and handed it to Roly. “Drink
that, by cripes ; no wonder the poor cow
wasn’t here this morning. Drink it all.
Roly!”
Work stopped. It was a stark shock.
Someone said “Christ, who’d have
thought it?” Then, “What happened?”
Roly couldn’t tell much. Even the
wine couldn’t cope with the horror of
it... “I called out when I got near the
hut —no answer —thought he must be
away somewhere —bag door all fastened
—his dog—whinging inside —flies like
bees —bloody swarms of them —called
out again—dog barked savagely—some-
thing wrong —risked the dog—lifted the
flap—Christ! one look enough—dog
didn’t stir to bite me.”
They gave Roly a horse and he rode
into Summerlea for the police and the
doctor.
POLICE and doctor went out in due
course. The doctor couldn’t do
much for Billy now ; he could only point
the obvious —that Billy Barton had been
shot in the back of the neck and had
been dead for about two days.
There was an inquest, of course. The
school was the most convenient place to
hold it, and the children on arrival at
school next morning had the excitement
of seeing groups of very serious men
standing about. They knew them all,
but now they looked different. Mr.
Foster shooed the children away from
the building, but not before they saw
Billy Barton’s famous shotgun, double-
barrelled and very long in the barrel,
standing near the school door. Around
the stock, loosely tied and bulky-looking,
was a bloodstaine4 handkerchief. One
of the boys with a taste for the morbidly
exciting told the others with great cer-
tainty that “they had Billy Barton’s neck
in that there handkerchief.”
The coroner, the P.M. from Summer-
lea, was a stooped litfle man, with runny
eyes that seemed to make him an ideal
person to conduct such inquiries. Other-
wise he seemed rather too v mild for a
hard world where suchj things can occa-
sionally happen.
He examined the pertinent witnesses —•
and there were many of them —but there
was a complete lack of any motive on
the part of any known person for doing
away with Billy. (He was promoted to
“William” by the coroner, and as such
was hardly to be recognised.) No one
ever had a hard word for Billy. He was
harmless. No one would think of hurting
him.
The doctor explained the nature of the
wound and gave it as his opinion that it
could have been self-inflicted —though
rather difficult in the circumstances. It
could have been accidental. The gun
was under the blanket and lying along
Billy’s back. The shot could, of course,
quite easily have been fired by* someone
else. Here, again, the coroner was beset
by lack of motive.
Adolf described the fight as a foolish
quarrel that meant nothing. Didn’t hear
what Billy Barton said to Travers during
the fight. They were all a bit drunk at
the time. Didn’t think there were any
hard feelings about it. The coroner
mildly thought it a pity that so much
wine should be served at threshing time.
Emil Schneider said it was good wine
{Continued on page 32.)
THE JERRY-BUILDER.
I knew him as Mark Svensen, fisherman,
But the town soon named him “Sea-
prawn”—someone said
His whiskers swept the same ferocious
angle.
He lived in a shack he built a chain
above
High tide (permitted under fishing
licence).
And of his coming to the town, it knew
As much of him as of the driftwood left
Around his door by the ebbing of spring
tides ...
Old Mark had bought a derelict fishing
boat
At public auction, paying thirty pounds.
“We will go home to Denmark in this
boat,”
He told his daughters once, while all
three caulked >
At low tide, bailing out the high. He
spoke
Of quiet harbors he once knew in
Denmark
And of the mermaid waiting on the rock
(A fairytale that men had moored to
stone).
The local fishermen had known the hull
And said his bolted planks would never
mend
Her broken back, yet always Mark
replied:
“We will go home in her!” And with
white paint
Glittered his dream above the water’s
shine.
It was the night the “Annie’s” crew
cashed in
The mackerel cheque, they took a pot
of tar
And with drunken brushmarks sprawled
across the hull:
QUEENSLAND.
‘‘Denmark or bust." I was yarning with
the Dane
Next morning when he saw their merri-
ment.
I watched him turn away from ship and
sea;
“I thought of her,” he said, ‘‘like some
old tree
And hoped new timber grafted would
revive
Her spirit; saw through paint her lines
emerge
In waking colors from deciduous time —
And all the splendid symmetry of ropes
Coiled, hoisted rigging, I had hoped
Today to veil upon her like the web
A morning spider hangs upon the leaves,
Bedewing it with gleaming pulley-blocks.
And then, the flowering beauty of her

THE ATOM BOMB DILEMMA.
One of those correspondence duels that
regularly blaze up on the London
“Times” leader page, always bringing
forth some interesting information and
usually drawing iq. world authorities on
the particular subject, was lately set
going by a Mr. Julian Brown, who ques-
tioned the morality of the atom bombing
of the Japs and suggested that, instead
of the bombs being dropped on Hiro-
shima and Nagasaki, they should have
been dropped at sea or on some unin-
habited area for effect.
Mr. Brown implied that the Japs,
made thus aware of the frightful destruc-
tive power of the bombs, may have been
just as eager as the bombs made them to
turn the war in. America, with the other
Allies who knew of the atom bomb’s
power, would thereby have kept a clearer
conscience.
This question of the morality of the
atom bombing has kept cropping up ever
since the things were let loose in August,
1945. America, as the country which
shouldered the awful responsibility of
first using the bombs, has given many
signs of feeling uneasy about it. On that
account also, of course, in appease-
ment of Russia —some have advocated
the destruction of the stockpile of atom
bombs which America has since built up.
They have not had much of a hearing;
in fadt, others have countered that, so
far from destroying those it possesses,
America should, for safety’s sake, in-
crease its production of the bombs. But
there is no doubt that America has a
definite conscience on the matter, and
the great care that U.S. authorities are
taking to try to safeguard the world
from the future use of the bombs,
through a plan which goes further than
any comparable proposal ever made, may
be accepted as a symptom of that un-
easy conscience.
On this aspect of what is really a very
thorny and difficult problem a decidedly
awkward question was asked by one of
the London “Times” letter-writers, “I
submit,” he wrote, “that the following
question may well be addressed to nations
claiming the right of judgment against
others: Had the use of the atomic bomb
on inhabited regions been originated by
Germany and her allies, would that act
have been included in the indictment of
war crimes?”
Another of the letter-writers countered
with what may be thought an effective
reply. “Surely,” he wrote, “the morality
of bombing does not in any way vary
with the size of the bomb or with its con-
stitution, atomic or otherwise?”
However, that in turn brought a final
crusher. “Whether the morality of bomb-
ing varies with the size or constitution
of the bomb is debatable,” this writer
contended, “but there can be no doubt
whatever that it does vary with the nature
of the target.”
Two-bomb Bluff
Before the London “Times” discussion
was through it had brought in Dr. A. L.
Goodhart, Professor of Jurisprudence at
Oxford, with a remarkable item of infor-
mation.
Reading Mr. Julian Brown’s original
letter as implying that “the United
States, acting under the direct orders of
the President, was guilty ,of callous in-
difference in destroying two Japanese
cities that could have been saved if
adequate warning had been given by
dropping the first bombs on some unin-
habited district or in the sea,” Dr. Good-
hart, referring to the authority of former
U.S. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson,
stated that “the two bombs dropped on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the only
two then in existence,” and that others
could have been produced “only slowly
and in small numbers.”
* It was therefore imperative that these
two bombs should bring the war to an
immediate end. A bomb dropped on some
uninhabited district might have impressed
the Japanese scientists with its destructive
power, but would it necessarily have per-
suaded the military leaders to agree to
unconditional surrender? This was a risk
that the Allied leaders were not entitled
to take.
Dr. Goodhart further quoted Mr.
Stimson as stating that “unless the atomic
bombs had brought the war to a definite
conclusion major fighting would not have
ended before late 1946 at the earliest,
with an anticipated cost of more than
1,000,000 casualties, and with the
Japanese islands left even more
thoroughly devastated than was the case
in Germany.”
Writing in “Harper’s Magazine,” Mr.
Stimson had added that “the decision to
use the atomic bombs was a decision that
brought death to over 100,000 Japanese
....but this.deliberate, premeditated de-
struction was the least abhorrent choice.
The bombs dropped on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki ended the war. They also made
it wholly clear that we must never have
another war.”
Thus Mr. Stimson, who was Secretary
of War at the time the bombs were
dropped, establishes that that action
carried a considerable element of bluff.
As far as the Japs knew, there may have
been an unlimited number of the bombs,
and the fact that the only two then in
existence were dropped only three days
apart would almost certainly have tended
to confirm that belief. Also, the Russians,
who can be said to have been blown into
the war against the Japs by the same
bombs that blew the Japs out, were no
doubt also taken in by that gigantic bluff.
Japs* Mixed Reactions
Most of the “Times” letter-writers ap-
peared to believe that what happened in
those grim August days in 1945 was
simply that the terrible bombs were
dropped and the Japs were thereby made
instantly and unanimously eager to quit.
The atom bombs were decisive, but in
nothing like that sweeping sense. A re-
port issued by the U.S. Strategic Bombing
Survey, covering both the destructive and
the political effects Of those two bombs,
showed that they were decisive, not on
Japs generally, but because, coming on
top of already vast destruction and at a
time when eventual defeat of Japan
looked practically certain, they enabled
those Jap leaders who had for some time
been working for peace to sway the issue
against the war party.
That report has not had, outside
America, anything like the publicity its
interest and importance warranted. In
such publicity as it has had there has
been little mention of the Jap public re-
actions or the political effects. These,
very mixed, are. best seen against the
background of what actually happened
when the bombs were unloosed, nowhere
more plainly or vividly depicted than in
the Bombing Survey’s report, which
shows the bombings as among the most
terrible happenings in the whole dread-
ful history of war; more than justifying
Dr. Goodhart’s heartfelt “We can only
hope that this lesson, taught with so
much blood and suffering, has been
learned by all mankind,”
The Damage, and Why
The Bombing Survey party consisted of
110 engineers, architects, doctors, fire ex-
perts, etc. They gave their findings after
10 weeks of investigation in the two
bombed cities, and in each case they
found special reasons why the casualties
were so great. These are shown in the
following extracts from the report:
On the morning of August 6, 1945, most
of the industrial workers of Hiroshima had
already reported to work, but many workers
were en route and nearly all the school-
children and some industrial employees
were at work in the open on the programme
of b'uilding-removal to provide firebreaks
and disperse valuables to the country. The
attack came 45 minutes after the “all
clear” had been sounded from a previous
alert. Because of the lack of warning and
the populace’s indifference to small groups
of pjanes, the explosion came as an almost
complete surprise, and the people had not
taken shelter. Many were caught in the
open, and most of the rest in flimsily-
constructed homes or commercial establish-
ments.
The bomb exploded slightly north-west
of the centre of the city. Because of this
accuracy and the flat terrain and circular
shape of the city, Hiroshima was uniformly
and extensively devastated. Practically the
entire densely or moderately built-up por-
tion of the city was levelled by blast and
swept by fire. A “fire-storm,” a phenome-
non which has occurred infrequently in
other conflagrations, developed in Hiro-
shima: fires, springing up almost simul-
taneously over the wide flat area around
the centre of the city, drew in air from
all directions. Hie inrush of air easily
overcame the natural ground wind, which
had a velocity of only about five miles per
hour. The “fire-wind” attained a maximum
velocity of 30 to 40 miles per hour two
tp three hours after the explosion. The
“fire-wind” and the symmetry of the built-
up centre of the city gave a roughly circular
shape to the 4.4 square miles which were
almost completely burned out.
The surprise, the collapse of many build-
ings, and the conflagration contributed to
an unprecedented casualty rate. Seventy
to eighty thousand people were killed, or
missmg and presumed dead, and an equal
number were injured. The magnitude of
casualties is set in relief by a comparison
with the Tokyo fire raid of March 9-10,
1945, in which, though nearly 16 square
miles were destroyed, the number killed
was no larger, and fewer people were in-
jured.
At Nagasaki, three days liter, the city
was scarcely more prepared, though vague
references to the Hiroshima disaster had
appeared in the newspapers of August 8.
From the Nagasaki prefectural report on
the bombing, something of the shock of
the explosion can be inferred:
. The day was clear with not very much
wind—an ordinary midsummer’s day. The
strain of continuous air attack on the city’s
population and the severity of the summer
had vitiated enthusiastic air-raid precautions.
.Previously a general alert had been sounded,
then a raid alert; this was cancelled, and
the alertness of the people was dissipated
by a great feeling of relief.”
When two 829 s were again sighted
coming m the raid signal was not given
immediately; the bomb was dropped and
the raid signal was given a few minutes
later. Thus only about 400 people were in
the city’s tunnel shelters, which were
adequate for about 30 per cent, of the
population.
“When the atomic bomb exploded, an
intense flash was observed first, as though
a large amount of magnesium had been
ignited, and the scene grew hazy with white
smoke. At the same time at the centre
of the explosion, and a short while later
in other areas, a tremendous roaring sound
was heard and a crushing blast wave and
intense heat were felt. The people of
Nagasaki, even those who lived on the
outer edge of the blast, all felt as though
they had sustained a direct hit, and the
whole city suffered damage such as would
have resulted from direct hits everywhere
by ordinary bombs.”
Between 35,000 and 40,000 were killed,
and about the same number injured.
The report grimly stated that those two
cities “were chosen as targets because
of their concentration of activities and
population.”
Doctors, Nurses, Hospitals
The great mortality among those
seriously injured was contributed to by
the casualties among doctors and nurses
and the destruction of hospitals. “Of
more than 200 doctors in Hiroshima be-
fore the attack, over 90 per cent, were
casualties, and only about 30 physicians
were able to perform their normal duties
a month after the raid. Out of 1780
nurses 1654 were killed or injured. Only
three out of 45 civilian hospitals could
be used, and two large army hospitals
were rendered unusable.”
The Bombing Survey report also
pointed out that the effect of the bombs
“came not only from the surprise and
their crushing power, but also from the
feeling of security among the inhabitants
of the two cities before the attacks”:
Though Nagasaki had undergone five
raids in the previous year, they had not
been heavy, and Hiroshima had gone
almost untouched until that morning of
August 6. In both cities many people
felt that they would be spared, and the
various rumors in circulation supporting
such feeling covered a wide range of
wishful thoughts. There were so many
Christians there, many Japanese-Americans
came from Hiroshima, the city was a
famous beauty spot —these and other even
more fantastic reasons encouraged hopes.
Going into the public reactions to the
bombings, the Survey was “not surprised”
to find that Americans were hated as
“cruel,” “inhuman” and “barbarous.”
“They really despise the Americans for
it,” the report said. Mostly what was
found was “fear and terror, anger and
hatred against the users.” Stating that
“the level of confidence was quite low
in Japan well before the time of the
atomic bombing,” the report added;
Even in the target cities, it must be
emphasised, the atomic bombs did not
uniformly destroy the Japanese fighting
spirit. Hiroshima and Nagasaki, when
compared with other Japanese cities, were
not more defeatist than the average. The
bombs were tremendous personal catas-
trophes to the survivors, but neither time
nor understanding of the revolutionary
threat of the atomic bomb permitted them
to see in these personal catastrophes a
final blow to Japan’s prospects for victory
or negotiated peace.
How the Bombs Decided
It was on a higher level that the drop-
ping of the bombs acted decisively. They
“had more effect on the thinking of Gov-
ernment leaders than, on the morale of
the rank and file of civilians outside of
the target cities,” but even among those
leaders the effect was found to have been
cumulative rather than direct and im-
mediate. They did not merely learn of
the damage caused by the bombs and give
in; peace moves had been long on the
way:-
It cannot be said that the atomic bomb
convinced the leaders who effected the
peace of the necessity of surrender. The
decision to seek ways and means to ter-
minate the war, influenced in part by
knowledge of the low state of popular
morale, had been taken in May, 1945, by
the Supreme War Guidance Council.
As early as the spring of 1944 a group
of former Prime Ministers and others close
to the Emperor had been making efforts
toward bringing the war to an end. This
group, including such men as Admiral
Okada, Admiral Yonai, Prince Konoye, and
Marquis Kido, had been influential in
effecting Tojo’s resignation and in making
Admiral Suzuki Prime Minister after
Koiso’s fall. Even in the Suzuki Cabinet,
however, agreement was far from unani-
mous. The Navy Minister, Admiral Yonai,
was sympathetic, but the War Minister,
General Anami, usually represented the
fight-to-the-end policy of the Army. In the
Supreme War Guidance Cabinet, a sort of
inner cabinet, his adherence to that line
was further assured by the participation
Safety-first in Planes.
Britain is certainly taking no
chances about the safeness of its
great Avro Tudor I planes before
putting them on the passenger
routes.
They were to have started within
the next month or so, but, tested in
Nairobi to see how they shaped
under tropical conditions, “three de-
fects developed: there was tail-
buffeting within a certain speed
range in very bumpy conditions;
there was a reduction in the air
miles per gallon ; and there was a
tendency to swing on the off-take."
Giving this information at a press
conference in London, Minister of
Supply Wilmot said: “With British
civil aircraft safety-first is not so
much a motto as a religion."
Urgent action is being taken to
cure the defects, but it is not yet
known when the Tudors will be
flying passengers.

of the Army and Navy Chiefs of Staff,
so that on the peace issue this organisation
was evenly divided, with these three oppos-
ing the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister
and Navy Minister. At any time the mili-
tary (especially Army) dissatisfaction with
the Cabinet might have eventuated at least
in its fall and possibly in the “liquidation’
of the anti-war members.
Thus the problem facing the peace
leaders in the Government was to bring
about a surrender despite the hesitation of
the War Minister and the opposition of
the Army and Navy Chiefs of Staff. This
had to be done, however, without pre-
cipitating counter-measures by the Army
which would eliminate the entire peace
group. This was done ultimately by bring-
ing the Emperor actively into the decision
to accept the Potsdam terms. So long as
the Emperor openly supported such a
policy and could be presented to the
country as doing so, the military, which
had fostered and lived on the idea of
complete obedience to the Emperor, could
not effectively rebel.
A preliminary step in this direction had
been taken at the Imperial conference on
June 26. At this meeting, the Emperor,
taking an active part despite his custom.
to the contrary, stated that he desired the
development of a plan to end the war as
well as one to defend the home islands.
This was followed by a renewal of earlier
efforts to get the Soviet Union to inter-
cede with the United States.
In the words of the report, “the atomic
bombings considerably speeded up these
political manoeuvrings,” The bombs
“did not convince the military that de-
fence of the home islands was imposs-
ible” ; what they did was to “permit the
Government to say that no army without
the weapon could possibly resist an
enemy who had it, thus saving ‘face’ for
the army leaders and not reflecting on
the competence of Japanese industrialists
or the valor of the Japanese soldiers.”
The second bomb was dropped on August
9; that night at an Imperial conference
the Emperor stated specifically that he
wanted acceptance of the Potsdam terms.
From this record of events it would
seem that the atom bombs actually were
decisive, though this was because of what
had gone before them. It would seem
also that, rather than any dropping of
them in the sea or on uninhabited
places having been likely to have achieved
the result, it was necessary to drop them
on cities, and necessary to drop the two
of them. “It is apparent,” the Survey
report concluded, “that in the atomic
bomb the Japanese found the oppor-
tunity, which they had been seeking, to
break the existing deadlock within the
Government over acceptance of the Pcfts-
dam terms.”
Soviet Atom Plan
With such a report before them, with
so much on the national conscience, and
also With such a measure of national
altruistic feeling towards the rest of the
world as the American people can be
fairly said to possess, it is no wonder
that American leaders flatly refuse to
share the bomb secrets without adequate
safeguards being first firmly established.
To that end they have made what can
only be called extraordinary, revolution-
ary proposals. Nothing like these pro-
posals, in all their implications, is to be
found anywhere in history. They repre-
sent the remarkable change that has been
brought about in American thought
since the ultra-national isolationism that
swept up after the other world war, with
the atom bomb conclusively responsible
for the change. Though these proposals
for atomic control have been chiefly
thought out by one man, Mr. Bernard
M. Baruch, they represent an expression
of national will; hence attempts to get
around them—wholly, of course, Russian
attempts —have not the faintest chance
of success.
The latest such attempt, made a couple
of weeks ago, was merely a repetition of
the attempt made as far back as last
June. The Russian plans brought for-
ward on the two occasions were as'good
as the same thing, and without any hope
of acceptance, either by America or by
any other nation not a Russian satellite.
For the comparison the Baruch plan
makes against it the Soviet plan is worth
setting down. The Russian plan pro-
vides that U.N.O. members shall
Bind themselves never to use atomic
weapons, and tp prohibit their production
and storage.
Agree to destroy within three months
from a date to be agreed upon all stocks
of atomic weapons, whether in a finished
or an unfinished condition.
Pass legislation within six months of the
date of the agreement providing for severe
penalties for violation of the agreement.
The Russians have cause to be un-
easy. For one thing, they do not possess
the bomb ; for another, the Baruch plan,
putting it up squarely to all to co-operate
openly and finally in adequate safe-
guards against any future production and
use of the bomb for war purposes,
directly challenges the Russians on one
of their most tender spots —their national
secrecy and suspiciousness. As “Life”
sees it, Russia, to accept in good faith,
“would have to change her whole policy
of secrecy, lift the iron curtain and per-
mit international experts to carry out a
continuing, inspection of her industrial
system.”
The suggestion has been made that the
— N.Y. “Daily Mirror."
FIRST, YOU CATCH THE RABBIT ...
plan challenges the Russians on a spot
even more tender —their aggressive de-
signs. Their foreign policy has been
called “aggressive and expansionist” by
U.S. Under-Secretary of State Acheson in
a Senate statement, and General Marshall
supported Mr. Acheson against the con-
sequent Russian Note of protest. At all
events, the Russian attitude is the crux
of the issue, and on how that eventu-
ally works out depends whether the
world’s way out of the atom dilemma is
to be into light or darkness.
“Staggering” U.S. Plan
A writer in Washington “Post” has
summed up on the Baruch plan: “There
can be no gainsaying the fact that the
power that under it would be vested in
the international atomic authority would
be infinitely greater than the power ever
before possessed by any international
body and would cut athwart national
sovereignty.” In “Life’s” view of it, the
Baruch plan “for controlling and shack-
ling the monstrous power of the atomic
bomb” is “as staggering to the 20th
Century human imagination as the bomb
itself.” Under the plan, as interpreted
by N.Y. “Times,”
....the nations of the world are called
upon to conclude a treaty establishing an
International Authority which would super-
vise, administer and control every phase
of atomic energy production; inspect all
nations for possible violations of the treaty,
and report serious violations, defined by
the treaty as international crimes, to the
Security Council and all treaty signatories
for punishment, without giving any Power
the legal right, by veto or otherwise, to
protect itself against punishment for such
crimes. The treaty would also specifically
recognise the inherent right of any nation
to take action in self-defence even before
the Security Cquncil acts, in conformity
with the United Nations Charter, if such
crimes are so grave as to constitute a direct
threat to it.
Briefly, the Baruch plait proposes a
supreme atomic authority to which all
nations would surrender control of their
atomic resources and plants, all countries
being completely open to inspection, with
the necessary force on hand to punish
violators of the agreement. # What it asks
is that all nations should agree to “a
practical and enforceable way of remov-
ing the weapon for ever.”
Mr. Baruch himself
has said in explana-
tion of the plan:
“Behind the black
portent of the new
atomic age lies a hope
which, seized upon
with faith, can work
our salvation. If we
fail, then we have
damned every man to
be the slave of fear.
Let us not deceive our-
selves: we must elect
world peace or world
destruction,” The
U.S., Mr. Baruch
added, “stands ready
to proscribe and de-
stroy this instrument
—to lift its use from
death to life—if the
world will join in a
pact to that end.”
The life-and-death
dilemma touched on
by Mr. Baruch has
been succinctly
pointed out by Mr.
Noel-Baker, giving
Britain’s views. “There
must,” Mr. Noel-
Baker said, “be inter-
national control for
all purposes, safe*-
guarded at every stage,
or the renunciation of
the use of all atomic
energy for any pur-
pose, or the continua-
tion of the present
position, which is an
atomic armaments
race.”
Actually, in America the war and peace
purposes of atomic energy are being ad-
vanced side by side. Hanson W. Bald-
win has stated in N.Y. “Times” that the
laboratories and plants under the con-
trol of the commission headed by Mr.
David E. Lilienthal “are not only manu-
facturing Nagasaki-type bombs and de-
veloping methods of building more
powerful bombs, but also are experiment-
ing in all the peace-time uses of atomic
fission.” While this is so, the U.S. plan
proposes that, when an adequate system
of control has been agreed upon and
put into effective operation “and condign
punishments set up for violations,” no
more bombs shall be manufactured, ex-
isting bombs shall be disposed of, and
the international authority set up “shall
be in possession of full information as
to the know-how for the production of
atomic energy.”
In other words, stage by stage, as its
plan is put into effect, the U.S. will turn
over its secrets and its bombs. It insists
on essential safeguards, among them the
complete inspection of all countries by
the international authority. “That is our
price, and the price must be paid,”
Senator Vandenberg ? chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has
declared, adding “We shall not trust
alone to fickle words,’.’ “Previous
failures have been recorded,” Mr. Baruch
has said, “in trying the method of simple
renunciation, unsupported by effective
guarantees of security and armament limi-
tation. No one would have faith in that
approach alone.”
But that approach is what the Rus-
sian plan amounts to. It would secure
the destruction of America’s stock of
bombs, after which everything would
rest upon faith in the word .of nations,
including Russia. And that —as the
American attitude plainly enough says—
is asking quite a lot too much.

of plenty. Sir lan, instancing a company in
the heavy industries in which the sickness rate
had been as high throughout last summer as
was normal in winter, declared that “this was
general throughout industries in the big city
in which the works were placed.” He added:
“We are told the nation’s life depends on
increased production. No single act of gov-
ernment would be more likely to bring this
about than better rations.”

Mock Freedoms. —In a speech at Belfast Sir
David Maxwell Fyfe, who achieved great note
as a prosecuting counsel at Nuremberg, drew
up what he called today’s “four pseudo-
freedoms”: (1) Jo be spoon-fed —the economic
and moral fallacy that there is a bottomless
State pool to draw on; (2) Jo sacrifice others
to dead shibboleths —basing your policy on
party preconception instead of a direct solution
of present problems; (3) To interfere for the
sake of interference —the curse of overcentrali-
sation, which is the inherent temptation of
mankind; (4) To pass the buck—this means
that at home and abroad there is someone else
to take our decisions and do our work. In-
stead of these supposed freedoms there should
be: the incentive to a man to make his family
secure as far as possible by his own labors;
property should be widely held arflong citizens
so that its responsibilities, as well as its pos-
session, make a clear and general call; incul-
cation of the personal responsibility of the
individual for the future of the country; and
the chance for the adventurous that goes with
the encouragement of enterprise.

Japs Miss J. Bull. —Some of the most in-
teresting reports coming out of Japan these
days are written by the London “Times” corre-
spondent. Recently he described the United
Nations Study Committee, set up in Tokyo and
composed of “many of the ablest Japanese
diplomatists and former representatives on the
League of Nations.” Speaking before this com-
mittee, former Jap Ambassador tp Poland
Hitofumi Ito regretted that Britain was now
playing so small a part in Japan, although
“highly respected in the past.” He urged that
Britain should continue to play its “traditional
role in the Far East.” As it is, he said, Britain
is “gradually being forgotten in Japan,” this
either because of Britain’s willingness to allow
its influence to decline or the present British
Government’s “lack of interest in and lack of
understanding of the Far East.”

U.S. Restricted Immigrants. Quoting an
Associated Press report that “if the bars were
let down 14,000,000 Italians would seek to
emigrate to the U. 5.,” N.Y. “Times” states
in a leader that, while existing U.S. laws would
permit an annual immigration of 153,879, quota
immigrants are going in at the rate of only
about 80,000. President Truman’s attempts to
take in refugees at the rate of about 39,000
a year have so far failed. N.Y. “Times”
blames two causes for the restricted flow: the
inability of consular staffs to handle applica-
tions and the shortage of transport. As to this
last, the paper estimates that “30,000 American
citizens now abroad may have to wait from
one to two years before they can get home.”
It does not promise too well for the much-
shouted Calwellian immigration schemes.

J. Bull’s Shipping Decline. —Referring to the
practically-enforced decision of the British
Government to spend over $100,000,000 of the
dwindling dollar resources on purchasing 100
Liberty ships and 40 faster vessels from the
U.S., London “Times” commented! “At sea,
perhaps even more than on land, Britain needs
a respite in which to build her resources.”
Figures were quoted showing that, while the
U.S. dry-cargo fleet has grown since before the
war from roughly 7,500,000 tons to 38,000,000,
Britain’s fleet, which suffered war losses of
11,000,000 tons, has fallen from over 17,000,000
to about 13,000,000.

WHITE AUSTRALIA.
There has been a White Britain policy
for centuries, and, though never so-called,
it has been one of the sources of British
strength. There has been a White Aus-
tralia policy for half a century. It is
now in danger.
Fundamentally, as Dr. Evatt said in
Parliament last week, the White Australia
policy is economic rather than racial. It
was born of the influx of Chinese in the
gold days, an influx which threatened to
swamp the British population and its
standards. One of its midwives was
Australian Labor ; and, from the present
trend of affairs, Australian Labor,
or the party drifting under that name,
may* be its undertaker.
Twenty-five years ago only Domain
and Yarra Bank spouters and Communist-
party tutors dared to utter the heresy that
White Australia must go. Nowadays
Communist - party tutors and former
I.W.W. men sit in seats of the mighty,
and in intervening years hostility to White
Australia was increasingly voiced at
Trades and Labor Council meetings and
the like. In 1929 a Labor Council delega-
tion took part in a “Pan-Pacific” confer-
ence at Vladivostock, a conference domi-
nated by the Russian Jew Losovsky, and
in a vote for the abolition of the White
Australia policy as part of Moscow’s war
on “British imperialism.”
It was set out in the long thesis which
the conference accepted by resolution
that “a certain section” of the Australian
trade-union movement “steeped in the
illusion of class-peace, arbitration and
white chauvinism, was nurtured by the
capitalists”-—yes, these curious “Labor”
men agreed that White Australia was a
capitalist concept. It was agreed that
this led to “a false doctrine of the superi-
ority of the white or Nordic race,” a
doctrine fostered by “the imperialists in
their own interests in preparation for
coming imperialist wars.”
And it was laid down that “the struggle
against the Australian bourgeoisie must
be carried on parallel with the struggle
against British and world imperialism”
and that on the banner of the Australian
trade-union movement must be inscribed
the slogan “Not race war but class war.”
Laid down also that the objective must
be “to rally the Australian movement to
joint struggle with the international pro-
letariat 'against the national and inter-
national bourgeoisie.”
In plain language this meant agreement
to a plot to destroy the White Australia
policy as part of the campaign to destroy
the British Commonwealth. And, Mos-
cow having framed the resolution and
given its orders, “Australian” Communists,
inside as well as outside the A.L.P.,
naturally had to obey.
Mr. Ward’s mysterious liaison man
Garden, then Sydney Labor Council
secretary, was ready with a manifesto:
White Australia or Workers’ Australia
—which?
Labor need not hesitate nor fear to
defend openly and deliberately the interests
of the only class that matters to Labor—
the working class. Why, then, confuse us
and divide us by color and race labels,
instead of saying clearly and unequivocally:
“No white nor yellow nor black but a
working class. No White Australia, but
a Workers’ Australia.”
And this is the theoretic viewpoint of the
leaders of a large number of “Australian”
unions today, unions powerful enough to
defy the Government and establish law-
less wrecker-Governments of their own
which profess no allegiance to any
authority but that of Moscow.
- Seeing the purpose for which the propa-
ganda against White Australia was
launched, it seems no wonder that its
advocacy has created something beyond
mere repudiation of the belief in a racially
homogeneous continent, setting its own
economic standards. It is creating an
illusion in some quarters that to be black
or yellow is to be superior in some way
to being white and British and that the
interests of colored peoples must take
precedence.
It is painted as a crime and a mark of
“the Fascist beast” to be “anti-colored,”
though it is no crime and is accounted a
mark of “democracy” for the “coloreds”
•'
to be anti-white and anti-British. If
British troops in a riot in India were
forced, for the protection of British
lives, to fire on a yelling and murderous
mob, there would be an outcry about
“bloodthirsty terrorism” by certain noisy
interests from one end of Australia to
the other. But the cold-blooded slaughter
of a British Red Cross nurse in Sumatra
and of three Australian officers rescuing
Australian prisoners-of-war in Java
brought no protest from the Australian
public or action from the Australian
Government, which has surrendered in all
things, even to acquiescence in a criminal
boycott of Dutch ships and Australian
exports to the Dutch East Indies, to Com-
munist championship of “our “Inder-
nesian comrades.”
In New Guinea Mr. Ward’s “fuzzy-
wuzzy angels” and not Australian safety
are the primary consideration in the defi-
nition of policy. And the attitude of
sections of the press, of unionism and
“Labor” to the withdrawal of the British
from India seems to be that “democracy”
has triumphed once more and that retri-
butive justice has had its way with “British
imperialism.” Against these consumma-
tions it is nothing to such Australians
that with the British will go the right to
use Indian flying and naval bases, and
that from now onward these and other
facilities, so essential to our safety and
to our trade and communications, will
be usable only at such prices as those
countries may demand.
Already, before India is even “free”
and before there is an Indian Govern-
ment with a shadowy prospect of exert-
ing its authority without having to face
civil war, of perhaps 57 varieties, Leftist
writing boys are canvassing the possibility
that the White Australia policy must be
part of the sacrifice. And Dr. Evatt’s
reply to a question asked by Mr. Abbott
in Parliament indicates uneasiness and
unwillingness to place the facts before
Parliament:
Australia’s migration policy is based on
our economy. I don’t think the Govern-
ment of India will ever question it. It has
never been questioned so far.
This statement was made the very
day after the secretary of the Indian Gov-
ernment’s Public Relations Department
had said that “the Indian Government”
would “confer with the Australian Gov-
ernment on immigration laws.” And it
is matter of history that “Australia’s
migration policy” was challenged by the
Japanese at Versailles.
There can be no question that the trans-
fer of native populations in Asia must
come up for consideration in the rela-
tively near future and that the Common-
wealth and the British Dominions, even
Canada, will be faced with a delicate
situation which will be a challenge to
statesmanship.
“British” India, which, if the Attlee
arrangement is consummated, will cease to
be British next year, consists of 1,580,000
square miles of country—roughly 100,000
square miles less than the area of
Queensland and Westralia together,
which hold 1,600,000 people. Its popula-
tion, including that of the “States and
Agencies,” was 283,000,000 in 1901,
338,000,000 in 1931 and 388,000,000 in
1941, the increase for 10 years being seven
times the present population of Australia.
In Java something near 50,000,000 people
are living in an island less than two-thirds
the size of Victoria. Other countries in the
East Asian zone, including, of course,
China and leaving Japan out of con-
sideration, are in the same boat, or will
be unless war, famine and pestilence
write their dreadful 'Story again.
While Britain was strong, in complete
control of India, Burma and Malaya and
with great influence, direct or indirect, in
China, Indo-China, Siam and the Dutch
East Indies, the integrity of Australian
policies, including the White Australia
policy, was guaranteed. Now that
Britain is leaving India and Burma, under
the curious procedures of the British
Labor Government, and is necessarily
losing prestige in the other countries
named, Australia will be thrown upon
its own resources and statesmanship, and
as things are that means leaving every-
thing to the Minister who, while speaking
bold words abroad, connived at the ab-
ject surrender to Communist direction
of Australian policy as it concerned “our
Indernesian comrades,” and who deserted
South Africa when its treatment oi: its
Indian citizens was challenged by, and
ordered to bring a “settlement” to, the
U.N.O. General Assembly.
It is a situation in which Parliament
should bestir itself to see that Dr. Evatt
does not give away Australia’s birthright
under the impression that it is his own to
bestow. No major variation of policy
affecting the racial purity of the Com-
monwealth should be made without the
matter being thrashed out in Parliament
and without the people most concerned,
the electors, being given an opportunity
to issue a mandate. There are the seeds
of ruin in a wrong decision, even in the
timid adoption of a quota system.
This Freedom.
This is what we have come to in this
Australian democracy, declared by Dr.
Evatt to be worthy of leadership among
the world’s nations in the post-war era
of the Atlantic Charter and the Four
Freedoms. The story begins 20 years
ago, in days when we were still some-
thing like a free people and did not
realise it.
In 1928 an Australian citizen responded
to'a general invitation from the Com-
monwealth Government of the day to
subscribe to a dollar-loan floated on the
American market. Its success was a
matter of some urgency to the Govern-
ment, and to serve that end there was a
condition in the prospectus that interest
payments would be tax-free. The Aus-
tralian citizen, a grazier named William
George Magrath, now very old and
nearly blind and a loser of 40,000 sheep
in the drought, invested 92,000 dollars in
it. Two years later, under influence of
the world depression, another Common-
wealth Government —“Labor,” of course
—amended the income-tax law and
made interest payments on the loan tax-
able, a course which the High Court
held valid. Mr. Magrath, holding that
a contract was a contract, did not return
income received from this loan interest
in his taxation papers.
In 1942 the Commissioner of Taxation
assessed the man on all back years of
income, branding him in a 1943 report
to the Treasurer as having been con-
cerned in a list of cases “in which there
is evidence of evasion which, it is con-
sidered, is due to unreasonable careless-
ness.” Sticking to his principles, Mr.
Magrath sued the Commissioner in the
High Court for a refund qf all
he had been called upon to pay, £59,791.
The High Court upheld him and granted
his claim.
This was surely bad enough a record of
official tyranny in an allegedly British
democracy. There might have been some
departmental error of judgment, though
it is hard to believe that the Taxation
Department at no period during these
proceedings failed to secure an opinion
from Dr. Evatt’s Crown Law Depart-
ment. But, as for what followed, this
bureaucracy which is fastening its teeth
upon popular freedom is entitled to no
benefit of doubt whatever.
In that report for 1943 the Commis-
sioner asserted that Magrath had under-
stated his income for 10 years (1930-31
to 1940-41) by £109,053, and had been
ordered to pay £7531 “additional tax,
charged as penalty.” Prosecution? No ;
“evasiqn of the tax could not be proved
because of lack of evidence.” “Could
not be proved because of lack of evi-
dence,” but slug this fellow all the same!
Take his money in breach of contract
and fine him as well. On top of that, tell
the world he is a rogue, although you
can’t prove it, and to blazes with any
consideration about the confidential
nature of taxpayers’ affairs as imposed by
the law under which the Commissioner
was operating!
The High Court reverse compelled the
Commissioner to mention the Magrath
affair again, and this he did in his report
for the ensuing year, in terms here re-
produced in part:
Since the publication of the Twenty-
fourth Report the High Court has decided
in an action brought by Mr. Magrath
against the Commonwealth that, accord-
ing to the terms of the Commonwealth
bonds, the Commonwealth promised the
plaintiff as holder that the interest, after
having been paid to him in full, would
not form part of his assessable income
for the purpose of Federal income tax.
Mr. Magrath accordingly became entitled
to recover from the Commonwealth as
damages an amount equivalent to the
Federal income tax paid on the interest
from the bonds included in his assess-
ments (1944). In effect, the interest is freed
from Federal income tax.
No reference to the “additional tax,
charged as penalty.” No request to pur-
chasers of the Twenty-fourth Report
(still purchasable at 4s. a copy) to erase
from their minds the slur on Magrath’s
reputation therein contained. Only a
disingenuous withdrawal without an
apology.
Very properly the injured citizen did
not take this treatment lying down. He
sued the Commissioner for defamation
before the State Supreme Court. And
what happened then? The Commissioner,
agent for this high-souled Government
whose spokesman in world councils has
demanded special legislation for Human
Rights and the implementation of the New
Freedom everywhere—this representative
of hypocritical official tyranny pleaded
privilege! By his counsel he even
ple.aded as privilege immunity for his
official report, still in circulation, from
production before the Court! That did
not quite wash, but Justice Owen felt
obliged to uphold privilege as a defence
against the defamation charge itself,
although Magrath’s counsel insisted that
the Commissioner must have known,
when he made his report, that the High
Court action was pending. Privilege—
Crown privilege —defeated the charge.
The Judge directed the jury to find for
the Commissioner.
A wider jury, the mass of the Aus-
tralian taxpayers, will not follow
this direction. If such procedure by
“a high officer of State” were condoned
for a moment there could be no hope for
freedom in this country. For the Gestapo
is unmistakably asserting itself among us
and the Magrath case is but one more
vivid illustration of its working.
Only the other day Sir Henry Slesser,
a British Labor M.P. (1924-29) and
Solicitor-General, afterwards a Lord
Justice of Appeal, and then and since a
champion of the threatened rights of the
common man under the common law
of the realm, pointed out in a scathing
article in the “Times” that those rights
were being violated with dangerous fre-
quency by the new bureaucracy under
statutes authorising regulations abhorrent
in any free community.'Sir Henry warned
his fellow-countrymen that British civil-
isation which the world has learned to
respect and esteem, and to which our
political rulers pay some sort of lip-
service, is founded mainly upon the rule
of the English common law.
It was against this very tyranny that a
Hampden led the revolt of the Commons
of England in the seventeenth century
against the tyranny of the Crown —a re-
volt which ended in Charles I losing his
head. Because the Crown had not learnt
the lesson another revolt in the following
century severed the American colonies
from the British realm. That tyranny,
reviving in full force today, is asserted
in Australia not by the King but by the
Crown as typified in the King’s Ministers,
who have pushed aside the Parliamentary
ladder by which they rise (fortunately
the present tense is still valid) and
assumed that arbitrary and hateful dic-
tatorship against which the people have
elected them to be the constitutional
checks. And, although protesting voices
are sometimes heard from Canberra,
Parliament as a whole is compliant. That
Parliament shall be reduced to this con-
dition and remain in it is the clear aim
of Britain’s enemies in the world and of
our own.
. Theoretically, of course, the electors
can right the wrong and rout these
tyrants. Actually, ho\yever, the Par-
liamentary apathy that lies like a curse
upon this democracy is a reflex of a pub-
lic apathy, of the sheeplike toleration of
any infliction which the gubernatorial
bureaucracy imposes upon it; and a Gov-
ernment-run “Information” Department
is available to counter all incipient public
agitation by way of protest.
Two-fifths Unopposed.
Westralia is to have its Assembly elec-
tion on March 15, seven days after South
Australia.
In 1924 “Labor” captured the big
State, and except during the depression
period, when all the “Labor” Govern-
ments were sent about their business,
“Labor” has been in office ever since. Its
long term has been characterised
by the familiar obsession with lotteries
and other forms of gambling, and from
Wyndham to Esperance the most active
and flourishing enterprise in the country
seems to be the night trotting in Perth.
In other fields of industry it is quite an-
other story.
The population is stationary. There is
stagnation in soldier-settlement and in the
building trade. The Government rail-
ways are out of date and insolvent.
Hospital and schooling services are back-
ward. There are nine Ministers —South
Australia, with one-fourth more people,
gets along very well with six—and how
the nine contrive to avoid perishing of
ennui is an unexplained mystery.
The sober “West Australian” fairly
states that under “Labor” rule, Westralia
has “passed into a condition of complete
subservience to the Commonwealth.”
From the Commonwealth last year it
received a “disabilities grant” of £950,000.
a roads grant of £594,700 and a “special
payment” of £912,500, and the Govern-
ment is always asking for, and receiving,
more. Without these subventions and
others it would be hopelessly broke. Yet
with them, again as the “West Australian"
says, “social services, without exception,
are sub-standard, public utilities, almost
without exception, are sub-standard and
agriculture is retrogressive.”
A party with such a record should be
doomed for 10 years in opposition.
Yet when nominations closed the Premier,
four of his Assembly Ministers and 10
members of the rank and file were without
opponents. Four members of the Oppo-
sition and an Independent were also re-
turned unopposed. There were only 96
nominations for 50 seats.
One explanation of this appalling
apathy is the prevalence of pocket
boroughs. As in Queensland, the arrange-
ment of electoral boundaries is such that
“Labor” can win a large majority of
seats with much less than half the total
number of votes. Even at the 1943 polls


there were nearly as many electors in
suburban Nedlands (13,433) as in eight
“Labor” electorates, which among them
returned the Premier, an ex-Premier and
three Ministers —Roebourne (492), Kim-
berley (590), Pilbara (812), Gascoyne
(949), Mt. Magnet (2225), Kanowna
(3094), Murchison (3237) and Boulder
(3437). This time “Labor” isn’t even
running a candidate for Nedlands, whose
adult population now assuredly exceeds
that of the eight divisions named.
“Labor,” once strong for equal elector-
ates, has long been content with a state
of affairs under which the north and the
goldfields are over-represented and Perth
and the farming and fruitgrowing districts
under-represented.
In the parlance of the turf and of the
s.-p. shops which “Labor” unsuccessfully
tried to legalise, “Labor” once more con-
siders itself a paper certainty. But —
again in the argot of “sports”—paper
certainties sometimes come unstuck, and
so it may be on this occasion, when so
many people have had and are having
so much to put up with.
PLAIN ENGLISH
Too Little, Too Late.
Six months ago, when the Opposition
leaders proposed tax-cuts comparable to
those introduced in Canada and New
Zealand, the word “bribery” was hurled
at them from hundreds of Labor plat-
forms. Mr. Chifley set his supporters
the example :
Those parties that once paraded a policy
of sound finance now attempt to corrupt
the people and threaten our internal sol-
vency with promises that will not stand
examination, and indeed that amount to
unbridled election bribery that cannot pos-
sibly be paid.
Mr. Dedman made a contribution of his
own to the chorus of outraged virtue:
The wealthy pay up to 18s. 6d. in the £.
That leaves them with sufficient to live
very comfortably.
It is not nearly sufficient for a pastor-
alist, taxable “up to 18s. 6d. in the £” on
income in a good year, to repair the
ravages of drought; but what Mr.
Dedman and his horde of planners, whose
leader undertook nearly three years ago
to “revolutionise” the building industry,
don’t know about the affairs of jpastor-
alists would fill books equal to the entire
literary output of their god Laski, m
these days somewhat dented.
Now, under pressure of circumstances,
among them the imminence of Assembly
elections in South Australia, Westralia,
Queensland and N. S. Wales, and per-
haps in Victoria, where the “Labor” Gov-
ernment is in a precarious position, Mr.
Chifley has decided to do what he de-
nounced Mr. Menzies and Mr. Fadden
for proposing six months ago. He is
going in for what, referring to the Fadden
plan, he pronounced “political bribery,
fraud and deceit.” There are to be general
income-tax and sales-tax cuts, reckoned
at £40,000,000 or more in the first year.
They are not generous enough, nor are
companies to benefit, nor are share-
holders to be freed from the swindle of
double taxation —tax of dividends at the
source and in their hands. Neither is the
partial measure of relief to be accom-
panied by any reduction in the frightful
cost of government. The outlay on social
services is to be increased by additions
to pensions which would have been un-
necessary if the incidence of sky-high
taxes, particularly sales-tax, on the cost
of living had received proper attention.
And what a power of industrial mis-
chief has been done because Mr. Chifley
and those dreaming pedants his advisers
were so stubborn in the wrong, and for
so long!
There has been a general refusal
of overtime when it is necessary
in nearly all trades and callings, particu-
larly those concerned with the produc-
tion of materials and consumer-goods,
that overtime should be worked. There
have been strikes in every State, strikes
grounded in dissatisfaction with the exac-
tions of Mr. Chifley’s tax-gatherers, and
bringing calamity even to industries in
which men were willing to work. Com-
munists exploiting this dissatisfaction
have strengthened a position seriously
weakened when the bottom fell out of
the Russian boom, and the Chifley Gov-
erpment’s influence over the industrial
wing of the movement has slumped to
zero. This was shown when the
A.C.T.U. declared for a general May Day
strike —still A.C.T.U. “policy,” despite
N.S.W. and Queensland Labor promises
of 40-hour-week legislation—-and when
the N.S.W. coalminers threatened another
strike, a disaster heralded by a
Communist-arranged Sydney mob demon-
stration which surged up to Parliament
House.
And the situation which has given
Communists a second innings will go on
f°r aJ least another five months, for the
tax-cuts are not to become effective until
July 1. They could have been dated
from January 1 if Mr. Chifley and his Dr.
Coombcs had not been so stubborn and
so blind to necessities and possibilities.
Stubbornness is seldom an ingredient of
strength. It is a quality pertaining to a
weak and foolish type of woman.
Chifley's Luck.
One of the Prime Minister’s answers to
Parliamentary questions last week threw
some light on the reign of lawlessness.
Mr Gullett, a returned soldier who
went from the Middle East to New
Guinea and then to France, was the
questioner. By way of introduction he
explained that he had tried to buy a house
and had inquired about a dozen, but had
found that so soon as it was known that
he insisted on paying the pegged price and
no more the deal was off. He asked
whether the P.M. would either enforce the
law by punishing offenders or repeal it.
The P.M. replied that even if “some”
people broke the law, it had probably
prevented prices from skyrocketing, and

him, in preventing increases of rates
out of keeping with the Valuer-General’s
appraisements.
Mr. Chifley seemed well pleased with
himself as he sat down. In a sense he
was warranted. For it is improbable that
any contemporary or previous Prime
Minister of a British State has been lucky
enough to have a Parliament so com-
plaisant as not to object to his assurance
that the only people who can benefit
from his anti-blackmarketeering laws are
blackmarketeers.
Forty Hours.
According to the specious Mr. Ormonde,
who writes “ ‘Labor’s’ viewpoint” for
“S. M. Herald,” the pre-elections activity
of two State “Labor” Governments, by
way of forcing a 40-hours decision
upon the Federal Arbitration Court, is so
disinterested, so entirely founded in the
pursuit of national well-being, that the
said court ought positively to wel-
come this voluntary co-operation. To
Mr. Ormonde “workers’ confidence is
now re-established,” maximum produc-
tion by all hands is now waiting around
the corner and “organised Labor will
accept its responsibility under the
changed hours, knowing that, unless pro-
duction is stepped up, the 40-hour week
will be but a hollow gain.”
This stuff will delude nobody, and even
Mr. Ormonde reveals secret fears that
the political reinforcement of the unions’
agitation will not even avert the
threatened May Day general strike for a
40-hour week and other things. Such a
strike would, of course, do anything but
assist the McGirrs at the N.S.W. polls.
Nobody in his senses believes that every
union executive, Commos included, will
henceforth behave as though there were
nothing any longer to strike about.
The case against 40 hours at this junc-
ture is so formidable that “Labor”
spokesmen do not attempt to answer it.
That the era of shorter hours under
modern conditions of factory life is
bound to come is generally accepted. In-
creased mechanisation will assure it, and
a really educated community will deserve
and need it. But its assertion by force
at this time will establish nothing but
the principle that arbitration courts, if
not actually vulnerable, ought to become
so to “the workers’ ” pressure—industrial
or political. There will remain the prob-
lem of industries which cannot be con-
ducted on a 40-hour-week basis, and
which, their own costs increased, as a
certain consequence, will certainly de-
mand more for their produce.
The cost of a 40-hour rule in the
Commonwealth today could only be dis-
astrous to national-development plans.
The States’ transport services will be
made bankrupt at one sweep, even though
fares and freight-rates are raised, as they
must be. What it will do to those who
are trying to get homes built within their
limited means is appalling in prospect.
The taxpayers are entitled to hear from
Mr. Chifley, too, the amount likely to be
added to such schemes as the unification
of railway gauges, calculated at £230
million.
Apart from all these considerations, is
this the sort of attitude for Australia
when the need for development of our
national energy, strength and fitness is
desperately urgent in face of the looming
challenge from Asia, and when Britain,
struggling to recover her international
place and balance against the most for-
midable odds, is by every gesture implor-
ing the Dominions to roll up their sleeves
and lend a hand? And is there not a
grim warning of the dirty game
“Labor’s” pro-Russian extremists are
playing in this country from Vyshinsky’s
announcement in Moscow that the 48-
hour week, six days at eight hours, is
being incorporated in Russia’s constitu-
tion in order to assure that country’s re-
. construction programme?
Red Libel on Canada.
In a Canadian dispatch to the Adelaide
“Advertiser,” one of those papers which
do not disgrace daily journalism by run-
ning eight-page s.p. supplements, it is
stated that “Mr. Mackenzie King has
cleared up a lot of fantastic talk—a boon
to Moscow Radio—about the United
States demanding military bases in the
Canadian North.”
Denying such reports vigorously, and
condemning equally tales about the two
countries fortifying the Arctic against
Russia, the Prime Minister revealed that
what has happened or is likely to happen
is nothing more than a continuation of
the joint defence policy which came during
the war.
The new agreement has been entered into
with the full knowledge and approval of
the British, and it in no way interferes
with obligations to U.N.O. There are
to be exchanges of military officers and
technicians, of observers at military exer-
cises and tests, and of all military secrets,
with encouragement for common designs
and standards in arms and equipment.
Australians, of course, got the Moscow
story, with additions cooked up by papers
like “PM.” That poisonous New York
rag, whose late editor, Ingersoll, brought
out a ferociously anti-British book,
serialised in the Sydney “Daily Tele-
graph,” on the Anglo-American cam-
paign in France, alleged in an article, also
republished in Sydney, that Canada was
being “subjected to heavy pressure from
the U.S.A. for the cession of Arctic bases
and training grounds.” The assertion
was made that “official Canada today is
more frightened of United States militar-
ism than of Soviet expansionism.”
The truth is that relations between the
United States and Canada were never
better, and that Red lies and half-lies
alleging intimidation on the one hand
and ignoble surrender on the other are
resented in Canada even more keenly
than south of the undefended frontier
which is an object lesson to the whole
world.
One of the main missions of Canadian
diplomacy is to strengthen the ties link-
ing the United States and the British
Commonwealth. Into this diplomacy an
element of selfrinterest enters," but it is
dwarfed by a genuine Canadian desire to
see the other members of the British
Commonwealth enjoying the same bene-
fits of co-operation with and goodwill
from the United States as Canada has
enjoyed during a century of fruitful peace
with its mighty and generous neighbor.
Canada has not assumed a provocative
leadership of so-called “small nations,”
nor did it turn South Africa down when
an alliance of European Communist and
Asiatic States combined to assert the
“right” of interference in the domestic
affairs of the Dominion which the King
and Queen and the royal Princesses are
now visiting.
In its relations with Britain and the
other members of the Commonwealth,
and with distressed European and Asiatic
countries, Canada has been generous to a
fault, though in one quarter, centre of
a world-wide conspiracy of ruffians,
knaves and fools, it has been repaid with
insult and crime.
The Prawns of La Perouse.
“Old-timer” has a day out:
The point of La Perouse is about 10 miles
from Sydney, just inside Cape Banks, between
Congwong Bay and Frenchman’s Bay, opposite
Cook’s landing place and the Original anchorage
of Phillip’s First Fleet. A hundred yards off
the point is Bare Island, an ancient fortress
with concrete gun-pits, underground passages
and galleries. It became a modern fortress in
1942, when it was equipped with men and guns
as part of coastal defences against the then-
oncoming Japanese. Today the old fortress
is a homp for war-worn Diggers, conducted by
Legacy and maintained by voluntary contribu-
tions.
La Perouse is one of our most historic spots.
It takes its name from that French seaman
who brought two battered ships into Botany
Bay on January 26, 1788, on the very day
that Phillip left there for Port Jackson. La
Perouse was then 2£ years out from home, on
a voyage which had taken him round the Horn,
north .to Alaska, across the Pacific to the
Phillipines and Japan, and south by way of
Samoa to Australia. A great admirer of Cook,
La Perouse enjoyed cordial relations with
Phillip’s officers and crew.s, spent six weeks in
Botany Bay and sailed away on March 10 of
that year. Neither ships nor men were ever
seen again. Forty years later relics were found
in the New Hebrides which seemed to prove
that the expedition had been wrecked there.
It had left at Botany Bay the remains of
Father Receveur, Franciscan friar, naturalist
and astronomer, who died of wounds received
at Tutuila when natives attacked and killed
some of La Pdrouse’s crew. In 1880 France
tried to buy the site of the French camp on
Botany Bay, but the needs of national defence
prevented the sale.
Australians who respect their history should
visit the site some fine Sunday, by car or
tram. The superintendent of Bare Island, after
they’ve got there over the nightmare of a rough
road flanked by rusting barbed-wire, will show
them the neat, scrupulously clean and com-
fortable veterans’ quarters within the old fort,
also the place where louts broke in to steal
a wireless set, billiard balls and the box for
donations. Near by they can inspect the modem
observation posts and gun-pits, now used as
lavatories by picnickers, and eye the empty
bottles, decaying food and piles of paper which
mark most public grounds around Sydney.
They may then retreat and go to the La
Perouse monument, holding their noses against
the stench from the countless rotting heaps of
the inedible residue qf cooked prawns. At the
monument they will find a huge motor-lorry
backed beside its" rails, a canvas awning tied
from rails to lorry and a large party disporting
itself within. Presently the lorry will go away,
leaving a drayload of melon rind, empty bottles,
food isavings, cardboard boxes and the inevi-
table newspapers. Shouts behind a near-by
“kiosk” will reveal seven or eight aboriginal
and part-aboriginal boys of from nine to 14
playing two-up. A big crowd on the little
wharf is struggling to get a view of another
crowd of similar beys and girls chanting monot-
onously “Throw in a coin” and diving for the
coppers and silver coins thrown by the goggling
crowd. Carefully avoiding fish offal and more
reeking prawns, the launch may be seen leaving
for Kurnell and Cook’s landing place, the
three voyagers in the bows feeding on prawns.
Back now, the prawns shrieking, to
stumble over a grassy slope to the Franciscan’s
grave. It is flanked by a heap of rotting
prawns and somebody has thoughtfully stuffed
a newspaper parcel of tea-leaves and other
rqbbish through the iron railings. The track
back to the trams is lined on both sides by
whites, aboriginals and half-castes selling fac-
tory-made boomerangs, ornaments and dill-dolls
of various kinds, one enterprising gentleman
permitting the buyer to obtain cigarettes or
tobacco with the purchase. “No ornament,
no smoke,” seems to be his business motto.
The day is warm, the crowds thicken, the de-
funct prawns rise up like a curtain of living
odors. As Ernest Scott, the historian, has said
of La Perouse:
His memory has been kept fresh in Aus-
tralia by the maintenance of a monument,
erected by Bougainville in 1825-26, on the
site of the French camp.
Peace to the hero! “ ’Ere y’are—fresh cooked
prawns, mate. Two bob a pound!”

CARRERAS LTD.- OVER 150 YEARS' REPUTATION FOR QUALITY
ŵ
POLITICAL POINTS
It was left to Earle Page to make the
gesture which should long ago have been
made by the “Government.” The man
who was Australia’s representative in 'the
British War Cabinet in 1942 has given
notice of intention to move that the Com-
monwealth should make a gift of
£25,000,000-worth of foodstuffs to the
British people. The only thing in which
the doctor is wrong is in calling it a
gift. It would be more properly termed
the payment of a debt of honor to a
hard-pressed nation which, with the
enemy attacking its shores continuously
and its existence threatened, sent a naval,
military and air force to the Indian
Ocean in 1942 sufficient to prevent the in-
vasion of Australia’s west coast —a turn-
ing point of the war, as General Eisen-
hower has placed on record.
The Communist who is standing for
East Perth figures on the list of nomina-
tions as “Mountjoy, Henry David, secre-
tary,” When he misses will a job be
found for him on the C.5.1.R.?
Phil Collier, twice “Labor” Premier of
Westralia, is in again, unopposed, as
M.L.A. for Boulder, which has known
no other member since 1905. Collier’s
period of service is rivalled only by W,
D; Johnson, who is standing for re-
election in Guildford-Midland. Johnson
came in four years before Collier, as one
of the original batch of Labor members,
but he was out for a term after the con-
scription business. With a bit of luck,
Johnson might have been the first
“Labor” Premier, instead of Daglish
(1904-05), and he was certainly the most
active member ,of the Daglish Ministry,
but the leadership always eluded him,
though he had a subsequent term as
Minister and one as Speaker.
The Q.P.P. (“Kewpies” to the Labs.)
has as young a lot of candidates as Aus-
tralia has seen. Of 13 in the field thus
far, the oldest is Roberts (49), Premier
Hanlon’s opponent in Ithaca ; the young-
est is Toombes (22), who is having a shot
at Powers in Baroona. Pie, the leader, is
44, and the average age is a shade under
36. Most of the team were servicemen:
Lawrence out for Maryborough, has the
D.F;C. and the D.F.M. to remind him of
his R.A.A.F. campaigning as squadron-
leader.
Wheatgrowers who are congratulating
themselves on not having the Scully
“stabilisation” scheme forced upon them
ought to remember the S.A. Government
in their prayers. The only non-Labor
Government in the 'four wheat States, it
was the only one to guarantee its growers
their right to accept or reject it.
They exercised it through the ballot-bpx,
gave a negative vote and thus “wiped” the
socialistic scheme, in anticipation of which
“Labor” agreed to let “Labor” N.Z. have
supplies for four years at ss. 9d. a bushel
—current export price, 14s. 6d.
When Townsville Chamber of Com-
merce asked nasty questions about the
falling off in the rate of loading by
Townsville wharfies, their local secretary
burst into the usual flood of Red denial
and invective and challenged the
Chamber’s president and anybody else to
debate the question at a public meeting.
Having some knowledge of what Com-
munists call a “public” meeting, the
president declined, but he suggested that
thfe matter could be tested by having the
next sugar ship loaded by sugar farmers
working at normal speed and comparing
their loading rate with that of the
wharfies. Whereupon an unusual silence
fell upon the challenger.
When tax-reductions were proposed by
the Opposition-party leaders six months
ago Chifley pronounced them impossible
and the proposals dishonest. They are now
to be made by Chifley—not voluntarily,
but under pressure from all quarters. The
cost to the electors of their decision to
keep “Labor” in office will be at the least
an unnecessary six months of prolonged
high taxation. What the delay has cost
the country in strikes and stop-work
days is beyond computation.
Housewives have noted with some
asperity a new technique adopted by
wharfies in Sydney. When a potato ship
comes in they strike and the ship lies at
the wharf until the potatoes rot. Then
the strike ends and the wharfies, called
upon to unload the ship, strike for an-
other 10s. a day “stench” money. There’s
a stench all right, but it doesn’t all come
from the spuds.
Having opened the Leigh Creek coal-
field in order to relieve his State from
the tyranny of N.S.W. coalminers,
Premier Playford has been prevented
from getting the coal to Adelaide by a
strike of railwaymen on the Common-
wealth-run Quorn-Alice Springs railway,
over which Leigh Creek coal has to
travel. Simultaneously there were more
N.S.W. coal stoppages and threats,
resulting in more Adelaide gas restrictions
and traffic cuts. The situation was brighter
at the beginning of the week, boys of the
workstopping breed having suddenly re-
membered it was an election week.
What a difference an election-year
makes! For months traders, manufac-
turers, farmers and consumers in Central
and'North Queensland have been crying
for more ships, apparently to deaf ears.
Now Premier Hanlon, already election-
eering, has announced that a whole
fleet is due from the south to deposit
cement, potatoes, paper, coal, steel and
other things and pick up Queensland pro-
duce. There’s a catch, though Hanlon
didn’t mention it —the ships have still to
get past the wharfies.
Just before Parliament adjourned in
December, Riordan, the Navy Minister,
informed it that ten mine-sweepers would
concentrate between the Barrier Reef and
Queensland coast from' 14/1/’47. Pre-
vious Riordan statements:
It is true that mines have been washed
ashore in the vicinity of the Barrier Reef.
They have been disposed of by the Mines
Disposal Squadron. There is no danger to
shipping.— Nov. 21.
I deeply deplore the tragic happening re-
ferred to by Mr. Davidson (“a motor-
launch and its occupants blown to pieces”).
I am exploring the possibility of increas-
ing the number of mine-sweepers.— Nov.
26.
I have arranged for the calling of volun-
teers to the fullest extent possible.— Nov.
29.
In Townsville last week Riordan an-
nounced that minefields near that port
would be cleared up in “another three
weeks.” Meantime, a cyclone had dis-
lodged further mines, and ship after ship
reported their presence, one having to
veer dangerously off course to escape one.
Riordan is one of five service Ministers,
whose worth to the country as such would
be overvalued at the price of a packet of
pfeanuts.
Another international wheat agree-
ment is on the way, the idea being
to set up an annual market for
400,000,000 bushels a year from the
U.S.A., Canada, Australia and Argentina,
and to control all international dealings,
with an export price based on a minimum
of 125 cents (about Bs. A) for No, 1
Northern Manitoba. Our share of the
world market would be 19 p.c. Little
things like Governments “acquiring”
wheat by “regulation,” selling it to
another country at two-fifths of the cur-
rent export price and charging the differ-
ence up to taxpayers (Australian “Labor”
practice) might or might not come within
the scope of the agreement.
Queensland’s Industrial Court has
handed down a ruling to the effect that
the man who pays the wages still has
the right to choose whom he will pay
them to. The M.I.E.U. sought to put
a man in a meat-works gang in place of
one preferred by the management. When
the management jibbed there was a stop-
work meeting and the employer (Borth-
wick and Sons, Murrarie) appealed to the
court. Neumann, the union secretary,
howled that the decision would “have
the effect of an atom bomb on the meat-
works in this State,” but “this State” and
other States have grown tired of people
like Neumann, and so have many union-
ists.
Scully, trying to defend the sale of
wheat to Sullivan —up to 18,000,000
bushels at two-fifths of the current ex-
port bushel-price—was not even plaus-
ible. He said he, Scully, had agreed with
Sullivan that “the 1945-46 season was too
far advanced for the proposal to apply to
that harvest.” Then why did Scully (not
Sullivan) try to have 1945-46 wheat in-
cluded in his since-defeated “stabilisa-
tion” grab? And on what possible ground
did Sullivan and “informed opinion”
(Wholagan’s perhaps) expect that world
price might fall below ss. 9d. within a
year? If Australia had to buy U.S.
wheat this month, the price would be
16s. 2*d. a bushel. Scully’s “Government”
has characteristically refused a Parlia-
mentary inquiry into a business that looks
rotten from every viewpoint except
“Labor’s.”
In its efforts to dislodge the only non-
“ Labor” Government, the S.A. branch
of the A.L.P. is exhorting electors to
“end the present state of isolationism”
and “vote ‘Labor’ and stand all square
with the rest of Australia.” At the same
time the executive of the party has
ordered its Federal members, “on pain of
loss of endorsement,” to vote against the
Bretton Woods agreement, which is sup-
ported by the “Labor” P.M. and Deputy
P.M. Bretton Woods is opposed by Ward
and Lang. Ward has, and Lang had,
some appeal to “Labor” bosses in Adel-
aide—there were three Lang parties there
when the pair were campaigning for
interest-default.
Under engagement to and by grace of
A.8.C., whose general manager Moses
has explained that he is Old English, an
American Jew, Winter, has come out
with an attack on the White Australia
policy and another —thinly sugar-coated
—on British policy in Palestine; this
when a renewed outbreak of Jewish
terrorism, never directed against the Nazis,
has led to the imposition of martial law.
If such impertinences are part of A.B.C.
policy, surely they could be left to the
other Zionist on the A.B.C. list of
spouters, the 1942 immigrant Stone.
The Law is moving with strange slow-
ness in two cases in which “Labor” ad-
ministration is concerned. One is that
of Joe Goldberg, who in Sydney on
November 20 figured in a prohibited-
imports case relative to the trunks alleged
to have borne the name of Senator
Keane’s widow. Though the Crown at
first opposed an application for adjourn-
ment, it let Goldberg go abroad by
plane, complete with passport and
priority—this with a witness from the
U.S.A. waiting—and the date of the hear-
ing, already twice adjourned, has become
as foggy as one of Calwell’s replies
about his “reffos.” Lang had this mystery
ventilated, though, of course, he could
not get a specific reply. Nobody has yet
asked about the delay in bringing to trial
14 persons arrested after the menacing
Communist rowdyism at the Menzies
election meeting in the Maccabean Hall,
Sydney, one of Calwell’s favorite stamp-
ing grounds, where pieces of iron were
thrown. Though nearly six months have
elapsed, only one case has been dealt
with.
N.S.W. South Coast coalminers do
their cause no good by accepting the
leadership of Communists, but their
“dusting” grievance is genuine. It should
have been dealt with by N.S.W. “Labor”
long ago. There has been a “dusting”
bill on the stocks for years, but it was
not produced until the miners—and Com-
munists—carried the grievance to the
gates of the Parliament House in Mac-
quarie-street. In the intervening years
“Labor” gave all the thought of which it
was capable to the setting up of a racing
club which was fined £lOO for illegally
using building materials, and to a pen-
sions plan for Assemblymen, awarding
them pensions far more liberal than those
accorded to maimed servicemen and ser-
vicemen’s widows,
Chifley says he is not going to inter-
fere to prevent travel priorities being
issued to Communists; and, whatever the
Chifley motive, he may be right. The
N.Z. “Freedom” reports that Elliott
(imp.), of the Seamen’s Union, opened his
heart to it, obviously under the impres-
sion that it was a Communist paper:
Look at the wonderful work Communism
is doing in Europe, where traitors to
workers have been killed off. You know
how we immobilised Dutch ships. Only
a few were able to limp up the coast
to the Dutch East Indies because a few
silly darned fools of returned servicemen
signed on as crew.
And two Communist yobs from Aus-
tralia cast up at an “Empire” conference
in London with the report that their
“party” had vowed the destruction of the
White Australia policy, presumably in
association with the Communist parties in
India (already the scene of a Communist
insurrection), China, Indo-Chipa, Burma,
Malaya, the Philippines and Indonesia.
There have already been painful reactions
in A.L.P. branches, and a wholesale ex-
pulsion of Communists is talked of.
Debating the Stevedoring Industry
Bill, Menzies, quoting facts and figures,
said that there had been a stunning
fall in loading and unloading rates, par-
ticularly on the Melbourne -and Sydney
waterfronts, and that men on £l3 to £l7
a week were drawing “attendance money’
at 12s. a day. When the bill was intro-
duced British coalminers, railwaymen and
seamen were working a seven-day week
to counteract the effects of the freeze.
They could be pardoned for concluding
that the Stevedoring Industry Bill was in-
troduced to reward Australian “workers"
for threatening the maintenance of the
British meat ration, a shillingsworth a
week.
From a man without a house:
No current press reports on the go-slow
tragedy* in house-building seem to notice one
of the main troubles. Probably there are rackets
in building material, the dragon which N.S.W. s
new Housing Minister declares h.e is pre-
paring to slay. But the racket in building-trades
labor is surely getting past tolerance.
In the good old pre-war days, when building
contractors went out and tackled a house short-
age in quick time without any official directions
or control, they relied upon their proven teams
of workmen who gave loyal and conscientious
labor within a contract price. Today these
builders, though they have reconstructed teams
of a sort, cannot get continuous work. Their
men will stay for two or three days a week
on the job; by that time they have earned
as much as they are willing to acknowledge
for taxation, and they simply betake themselves
elsewhere to casual and untaxed labor. Since
there is enormous demand for repair and other
casual jobs within their trades, they have every
inducement to take advantage of the state of
the times. Mr. Chifley and young Mr. Evatt
can hardly be ignorant of these facts; they
just ignore them.
Mr.- Commissar Bulmer has become so con-
fident of official laissez faire and of public
lethargy that he has ordered even a slowing-
down of the present go-slow on housing jobs
—in aid of another £1 a week on wages, the
Commo technique of the moment. Ex-service-
men ought to be keenly concerned about this
deadly play-acting by officialdom and union
extremists —or have they not yet been hit hard
enough?
H.C.R.C.T.R. and B.H.E.U. is the ab-
breviated title of a union covering board-
ing-house, pub, club, restaurant, cater-
ing and tea-room in N. S.
Wales. It has a lady secretary, and it
supported 10 p.m. closing at the McKell-
McGirr liquor-hours’ referendum. Now
it and she are exulting in the McGirr
promise of a 40-hour week and tremen-
dously scornful of a protest that 40 hours
will knock the 50-bob-a-week-“guest-
house” business endways. Feminine or
just union logic?


LANDED AT LAST—OR IS IT?
“That’s the one that got away from us six months ago; and look at it now!”
“It’ll do me for State-election bait.”


IT'S PRINTED
with WIMBLES INKS
“Jasby”; No one can tell me the
Digger has no gallantry in his dealings
with the opposite sex. I’ve heard hun-
dreds of ’em discussing their fiancees,
girl-friends, steadies, casuals and pick-ups
and I’ve never yet heard one describe
the female of the moment in terms that
would suggest she was anything short of
beautiful. The choice of words may not
always have been the best, but the senti-
ment was there. A slashing line, a snifter
sheila, a bobby-dazzler may not be the
phrases of which love lyrics are made,
but they leave no doubt of the user’s en-
thusiasm. The Digger is a romantic, and
even the plainest girl wished on him by
a mate at a dance becomes in retrospect
a damsel of surpassing beauty. The best
example I struck was the bloke who was
describing one of his casual flames.
“Strewth, she was a slashing line,” he
told us. “Honest, she was a real beauty.
Had a bit of abo. blood in her,' but you
couldn’t notice it, ’cept for her pose.”

“In Vino” on a roadside murder:
The Lavers murder case, verdict in which
was delivered at Bathurst (N.S.W.) last week,
is remarkable for the long passage of time
between the crime and the trial and for the
fact that a conviction was made without a
body or part of a body being produced. Dur-
ing the early hours of September 5,193 b,
William Henry Lavers, a storekeeper and farmer
living about 12 miles from Grenfell (N.S.W.),
disappeared. Hair and blood were found on
a petrol pump at his store, “a,noisy car” had
been heard in the vicinity and wheel tracks were
found; but Lavers was never seen again. Police
investigation involved a search for the car, end-
ing last year in the finding of an old tourer at
Carcoar and the building up of a chain of
evidence linking it with one McDermott. Possibly
the routine police case might have been strong
enough on its own to convict McDermott, but
drink-loosened tongues—his own and his half-
caste girl-friend’s—made their case stronger.
Witnesses testified that the woman, in a quarrel
with McDfcnnott, had accused him of killing
Lavers “for seven gallons of petrol,” and that
McDermott had said he was “not the only one
in it.” In defence McDermott claimed that
any confession he had made to the woman was
in joke. The jury didn’t believe him. He was
sentenced to death, but in N.S.W. that is only
a matter of form —murderers don’t die, only
their victims.

“Listening Insect”: I see that a gentle-
man in England is advertising for a
parrot with a vocabulary of 20
thoroughly bad swearwords. I doubt
whether the language runs to so many,
though 400 years- ago when an English-
man made the first translation of
Rabelais, who often ran to several pages
of variations on the same subject, he not
only supplied English equivalents of all
the French expletives but added several
pages of local vintage. There is, or was,
a Melbourne parrot which might fulfil
the advertiser’s requirements. It was in
the early days of radio broadcasting, and
its owner announced that it was a very
linguistic bird and he was going to put
it on the air for the benefit of the pub-
lic next Sunday morning. Thousands of
listeners tuned in and were greeted with a
flood of profanity which nearly set fire to
the ether. The bird was shut off and ad-
monished, but when it tried again its
language was even more lurid. In reply
to the howls of indignation, the owner
explained that he had bought it from a
publican and had no idea that it was so
depraved until he put it on the air. Per-
haps the microphone had the same effect
on the creature as it has on some radio
comedians.

“Pitt St.”; A day or so after my
Sydney paper had informed m‘e that the
transport panjandrums had decided to
let the outside space on ’buses for adver-
tising, one of the juggernauts passed my
tram with its sides and back carrying a
glaring sales message. My tram at the
time was sitting behind another which
had broken down, myself and all the
people with me and in trams behind were
already 20 minutes late for work, most of
the blocked trams were crammed with
people, so was the decorated ’bus. The
advertisement it bore was for a prepara-
tion for “nerves.”
* * * *
“Cauboy”; It is gratifying to learn
that the producers of the projected film
of Melba are using for her voice a singer
with an international reputation instead
of worn-out records. Her voice may not
"I Want to change it for one that's not so lousy.”
be like Melba’s, which I am told by
people who knew it in its best days was
like nobody else’s, having a quality all
its own, but at least it will have an
artistic distinction similar to Melba’s.
For years the radio demeaned Australia’s
greatest singer by broadcasting her actual
records. I heard Melba sing only when
most of the voice was gone and what
was left was the art, which was splendid.
But the modern generation who heard
only the broadcasts wondered why she
had such a tremendous reputation.
* * * *
“Zake”: As fresh and sparkling now
as it was when acclaimed at its premiere
at Prague 160 years ago, Mozart’s “Don
Giovanni,” given—for Sydney—a rare
concert airing recently by Singers of Aus-
tralia, presents probably more contrasts
than anything in the whole range of
opera. Certainly no other composer
could have taken a libretto which has a
run of typical eighteenth- century comedy
situations between the tragic opening and
the ghoulish denouement, and by the
magic of music which fits each situation
and character like a glove turn it into
opera-bouffe, an 4 this despite the con-
ventions which his period imposed. Never
have so much bitter satire and waggish
joviality been in musical juxtaposition. In
its action “Don G.” is one of the most
exciting of operas—and the tale of the
gay deceiver was written by a cloistered
monk. The composition took, for
Mozart, comparatively long. Yet the
exquisite overture was only one night’s
work, and that the night before the first
performance, which he himself conducted.
* * * *
“Ceg”: There’s a move afoot in Tas-
mania to enact that “up to the minute”
photographs only be used for electioneer-
ing purposes, instead of flattering por-
traits taken perhaps 20 years ago,
showing the candidate as a bright, young-
looking man. Sponsors claim election
candidates are often taken at face value.
Heaven forbid, for there are some awful
“dials” in Parliament and it seems ob-
vious that many are not there for their
looks. However, the business reminds
me of a woman in New South Wales
during the Lang regime. When she was
asked why she voted for the “Big Fella”
she replied that it was because he had
such nice teeth! Possibly as good a
reason as any other.
♦ * * «
“Loc”: From Tokyo, where rickshaw
boys and pedestrians were recently re-
ported to be “sprinting their damnedest
to comply with the U.S, 35 m.p.h, speed
limit,” comes news of the “Annual Im-
perial Poetry Contest.” On each occa-
sion of this yearly festival a different
subject is chosen for the verses —the most
recent being “Daybreak.” One of more
than 31,000 entries, the Emperor’s own
epic ran:
The day dawns hopefully on the town of Mito.
The sound of the hammer is heard clearly.
In the days when he was the “Son of
Heaven” this ode would have been a
sitter, but now the Emperor helps to
judge the competition, and the belt went
to the man who wrote
Fishing boats loaded with various fishes
Come into the bay at dawn.
Clear enough, no doubt, as a simple state-
ment of fact, but there’s no divine spark
about it. Perhaps daybreaks up there
are not quite so inspiring as they used
to be.
* * * *
“Bo”: The one thing above all others
that is feared by a chairman at a public
meeting is the woman who keeps inter-
jecting and refuses to be silenced by ex-
planations. She can’t be thrown out as
can a man if he turns nasty ; nor can the
chairman tell her to shut up. At the
annual meeting of a Sydney company
the chairman of directors, throughout his
unenviable job of explaining the reasons
for the poor year’s trading, was the target
for a bombardment by a desiccated
middle-aged woman shareholder of
vinegary expression and waspish tongue.
At his eighth attempt to elucidate the
major cause of the recession he had got
as far as “You will no doubt readily con-
ceive,” when she hopped up and snapped
out “/ certainly won’t! ” The long-suffer-
ing chairman gazed steadily at her for
fully ten seconds, then he said “Madam,
that is something I can readily believe!”
* * * *
“Bethune”; In one aspect at least daily
newspapers don’t seem to have altered
much in a century and a half. “Tin Hat”
(B. 26/2/’47) mentions a memo, to
country correspondents stressing the
urgency of sensational news. John
Walter, founder of the ‘Times,” pat-
ented a system of printing in which he
used entire words instead of single letters ;
he called the system logography and
early numbers of his paper bore the
heading “The Times or Daily Universal
Register, printed Logographically,” The
innovation was laughed at by his rivals
and it was a current joke that Walter’s
orders to the type-founders ran like
this: *
Send me lewt. of type made up in
separate pounds, of heat, cold, wet, dry,
murder, fire, dreadful robbery, atrocious
outrage, fearful calamity, alarming explo-
sion, interesting female.
The interesting female has become an
attractive blonde, but with the addition
of coal strike, wharf hold-up, power
breakdown, lottery results and housing
shortage the list would hold good to-day.

“Gravelsnatcher”: Sydney’s drinking
water (B. 29/1/’47)? Westralians who
travelled to the Middle East on the
Queen Elizabeth voted it excellent.
Judging by the quantity we consumed,
the Lizzie’s intake must have reduced
Sydney’s dams to dangerous levels. That
water did much to dispel the gloom
which settled on us when word went
1 round that there was no Westralian
beer on board. If the cost of living in
Perth rises much more I’ll cross the Nulla-
bor and live exclusively on Sydney water.
But, mind you, I won’t pay a bob a jug
for it as I had to on the Lizzie.
“C.A.L.”: For years the poor pedes-
trian has been schooled in dodging motor
traffic, but it appears that he will now
have a new terror to contend with. A
Perth man holidaying at a beach about
30 miles north of the city was assisting
to crate a catch of fish one morning
when a low-flying Tiger Moth flew down
oyer the beach and he was struck by a
wing, sustaining concussion and frac-
tures of the jaw- and collar-bones. The
pilot faces a charge of “bodily harm” ; the
first case in Australian history of an
aeroplane being used as an instrument of
assault.
* * * *
“Macnell”: Waterhen was on patrol
one black night not far from Tobruk.
The forrard gun’s crew and bridge saw it
together—a momentary flash of light low
down on the water. There was the
whirring grind as the mounting swung,
the subdued clatter as the loading trays
were heaved over and back, the met-
allic thud of the closing breech. A
moment’s pause while the “Ready” was
passed to the bridge, then the searchlight
flared across the quiet sea and wiped its
finger along the hull of an Eytie supply
ship. For six seconds he lay revealed,
then the light shut off. It was enough.
The director had got on and all guns
followed quickly. In ten seconds she
was blazing, showers of sparks and fly-
ing provision boxes showing clearly as
each successive broadside ripped into her.
Only a few days before Stukas had blown
to pieces the Solium garrison’s Christmas
dinner which Waterhen had spent all
night unloading, and her gunners gave
that supply ship no mercy. When she’d
finished survivors were hauled inboard
and the destroyer cruised round till dawn,
hoping to meet a possible consort. Day
broke over a deserted sea littered with
hundreds of floating Christmas cards,
addressed to the Italian garrison at
Bardia, all brightly colored, and all with
the portrait of Mussolini conspicuous at
their tops. Musso had achieved his am-
bition —at last he had Mare Nostrum to
himself.

“Eve”: I know a man who’s fighting-
mad. The council owns the land next
door to him, and on it grow crowds of
blackberry bushes, yielding him profit in
season. Bumbledom has been going to
clear the land for as long as he can
remember. It did it last week when the
blackberry bushes were laden with fruit
almost ready for picking.
* * * *
“Fate’s Price”: Thirty years ago, as a
schoolgirl, I lived in a street in a big
town and the mansion opposite filled me
with vague yearnings for a similar home,
I was horrified and shocked to see almost
every evening the head of the house
staggering homewards, the gutter often
claiming him before he reached the gate.
I was filled with pity for the wife who
rescued him and guided him up the
garden path. I have lived in many streets
and many towns since, but I now live in
that same mansion (modernised) and meet
my spouse (modernised) in the same con-
dition, coming from the same pub
(modernised) at the same time. He is a
nephew of the former owner, but I knew
it not when I married him.

“Horstffeathers”; Dirk Hartog was the
first recorded white man in Westralia.
Landing at Shark Bay, 400 miles north
of what is now the city of Perth, he
nailed an inscribed pewter dish to a
post. Eighty-one years later, William de
Vlaming happened along. He copied
Dirk’s writing on to an inferior tin plate,
added a chapter of his own voyagings,
and presented the pinched pewter to the
heads at Batavia. The tin plate remained
at Shark Bay for 21 years. Then French
souvenir-hunters arrived and took it to
Paris. Now the Gallic delegation to the
South Seas Conference has returned it,
doubtless as a goodwill gesture. To its
original possie on Dirk Hartog’s Island?
Not Pygmalion likely! To the Common-
wealth National Library at Canberra!

“Spokeshave”; These rain-making
scientists amuse me. No doubt they will
solve the problem some day, but how
are they going to settle who wants the
rain? There Was a simple illustration in
Melbourne some years ago. Victoria was
having a drought and a prelate pro-
claimed a day of prayer for rain.
Chinese market gardeners along the fer-
tile flats of the Yarra were irrigating their
fields and getting high prices for their
vegetables, and they prayed to their Rain
God to maintain the drought. Ah Loong
won. Expand this example to inter-
national proportions and you get a situ-
ation which makes the atomic-bomb
dilemma look quite easy. During the
Depression the London “Times,” referr-
ing to the fine Argentine wheat crop,
said; “It is impossible not to sympathise
with the Argentinians in the paradoxi-
cally distressing plight in which the mal-
ignant bounty of Nature has placed
them.”
IN SWITZERLAND.
“We should follow the example of Switzerland,
where hotelkeeping has been raised to the status of
a profession and no man can hold a license without
a diploma.” —Letter to “S. M. Herald,”
The Swiss in their discretion
Have definitely made
The calling a profession
That once was just a trade.
It ranks with the vocations
Debarred to all but these
Who’ve passed examinations
And gathered in degrees.
' Full store of arts and graces
They’ve got to have at hand,
The Zurich Bonifaces,
The Bungs of Switzerland.
They learn, by lectures taking,
They master, bit by bit,
All that’s required for making
A model licensed vit.
Not only how to cater
For all their signs attract,
But needs as great, or greater,
For courtesy and tact.
Diplomas must entrust ’em
With proofs they’re fit to stand
At the receipt of custom,
The Bungs of Switzerland.
With medicine and science,
Law, too, they share the fame
Denoted by appliance
Of letters to one’s name.
In straitened times and palmy
Alike they fill a perch
As firmly as the Army,
As surely as the Church.
Their rightful dues they earn and
Full deference command,
The taverners of Berne and
The Bungs of Switzerland.
How different their status
In Alpine glades and dells,
How yawning the hiatus
’Twixt-their and our hotels!
Selected for their fitness,
Their standards high are set,
While here, you’ll bear me witness,
We take —what we can get.
Shall ever we achieve a
Link with that worthy band,
The brewers of Geneva,
The Bungs of Switzerland?

“Clooter”: Since it has become almost
a breach of some regulation or other to
draw breath in this country, I can’t help
wondering what sort of emotion stirs in
the breast of a “controller” when he runs
into another “control.” There must arise
occasions in the private lives of our
bureaucratic masters when they find
themselves hampered, put to expense or
baffled by the ukase of some other
bureaucrat. For instance, if the cat eats
the pound of butter Mrs. Bureaucrat has
just bought and she hasn’t the coupons
for another pound, how does she feel?
And suppose the wife of a Common-
wealth public servant buys fish from a
cart in a Sydney suburb and is then
summonsed for buying it —fish being the
property of the N.S.W. Government and
“controlled.” Or some bureaucrat gets
the chance to buy a secondhand car at
£5O above the pegged price. And what
of the thrifty officer who pays off a block
of land, gets a permit to build and then
has the land or the material seized by the
Housing Commission or finds some other
authority declaring the area to be un-
suitable for housing? Strike me hand-
some, I’d better not follow this too far.
* * * »
“Passun”: Hanging about the Jap
guardhouse was an unbelievable assort-
ment of mongrel dogs who, cruel treat-
ment and starvation notwithstanding,
stuck to their masters. These curs ap-
peared to hate us as intensely as the Japs
did, and would bite the heels of any
Australian within range of their snarling
jaws. Eventually the only survivor was
Komi, a rice-colored bitch who had
scarred throe of our boys during her
vicious career. One morning four of us
decided she might be worth eating, and
our bravest heart agreed to strangle her
under a blanket. In an endeavor to lure
her into unwariness he held out an open
hand, made endearing sounds, and
eventually had the suspicious animal
within biting distance. To our amaze-
ment the future stew began a vigorous
tail-wagging and joyous yelping and be-
gan to lick the hand of her would-be
murderer in an affectionate manner. We
would not spoil her trust even for a
moment. In no time she was our friend.
A guard arrived unheralded and took to
us with his rifle butt while Komi
whimpered in terror. A little while later
the Jap marched off to the guardhouse
with the traitor impaled upon his bayonet.
“Ramac”; I’ll lay a pound to a penny
that the Jap officer who turned King’s
evidence on his mates at Rabaul was
happy to find himself in Australia and
that he’ll do his utmost to avoid a return
passage to Nippon. After the Yank re-
covery team came into Haisho prison
camp one of our ex-guards became
friendly with the Nisei interpreter of the
team. We saw them together on several
occasions, and then suddenly the guard
disappeared. Some Chinese found the
missing man outside their village ; he had
eight rifle bullets in his abdomen.
* * * *
“Melbn”: There is a lot of ancient
Melbourne history connected with the
merger of the Bank of Australasia
and the Union Bank of Australia, though
the deal was concluded in the Old Smoke.
The A’sia was the first bank to open for
business in Batman’s village—on August
28, 1838. It began in Little Collins-street
in a two-roomed structure of bricks
and tiles of the sort that can still be seen
in many small country townships ; two
fierce mastiffs guarded it by night and a
military sentry by day. The first manager
was David Charteris McArthur, who was
one of the first trustees of the Botanic
Gardens, helped to found the Athenaeum
—then the Mechanics’ Institute —was
president of the Public Library, played in
the first big cricket match in Melbourne,
became later president of the M.C.C.,
floated Melbourne’s first civic loan and
was even first in on the Country Roads
Board. The Union opened two months
after A’sia at the corner of Flinders-lane
and Queen-street, and was as ornate and
commodious as its rival. It was the off-
spring of the Tamar Bank in Launceston.
“Do I, Herbert, take this woman for my lawful Wedded wife? Too right!”
Both the original buildings could be
easily accommodated in the vestibules of
the present structures.
* * * *
“Ike Hollar”: I’m preparing to say
good-bye to the ha’penny. There is the
same unpopularity of the coin-increased
since cigs. became a packet—which
marked the passing of the farthing ; typi-
cal is the way the tram conductor scowls
when handed ha’pence with a fare and
passes the coins with the next change.
Many people refuse to take halfpenny
change; and traders are taking the same
advantage of that fact that their long-ago
predecessors did with the farthing.
Actually, long after the quarter-penny
had ceased to exist it was the custom of
shopkeepers to mark goods Is. ll£d.,
2s. llfd. or in some similar figure. Cus-
tomers either took a double quantity to
save the ha’penny or paid the round 2s. or
3s. I bet that at the end of another
decade the ha’penny will be as unknown
as is the fafthing to the present genera-
tion.
* * * #
“H.A.L.”: If “Bar Din” (B. 12/2/’47)
really wanted to study the Manual of
Military Law. then all he had to do was
to get himself placed on a crime sheet
or placed under arrest with a court-
martial in the offing. He could then de-
mand to be allowed to study it —or any
documents setting out army rules and
regulations—on the ground that he wished
to prepare his defence to the charge. My
first lesson in the rights of the soldier —
“ You're improving, dear. The lumps in the mashed potatoes are all the
same size tonight!”
he has some, believe it or not —occurred
when a cocky young adjutant, not long
out of the 0.T.C., came into the orderly
room and said “Some fellows have
a nerve! That little waster the provosts
picked up last night sent for me just now,
and when I went into the birdcage he de-
manded a copy of the Manual .” The
Legal Officer happened to be in the hut,
and put in “Did you let him have it?”
The adjutant shaking his head, the L.O.
immediately grabbed the red book off
the shelf and hurried out. Returning a
few minutes later, he said “That’s saved
your bacon for you, nay boy—and never
be such an ass again.” He followed up
with a little lecture on the rights of a
man under arrest, and finished by ip-
forming the now-crestfallen adj. that in
British legal practice the refusal to supply
a copy of the Manual to a soldier under
arrest is quoted as a classic example of
rank injustice.
* * * *
“Van”: I don’t follow “R. 8.” (B.
19/2/’47) when he says that the bombing
of the Wairopi Bridge affected troop and
suppy movements around Salamaua.
Supply and maintenance of Nips en-
gaged in the advance from Buna over
the Owen Stanleys and the subsequent
retreat was from the beachheads around
Buna. Perhaps “R. 8.” refers to another
Wairopi, or maybe his cobber George
mixed his topography as well as his
drinks.
* * * *
“B. A. Ker”: Sydney’s night-life! With
reluctance I sat in a hamburger joint for
three-quarters of an hour waiting for a
grill. During all that lime two middle-
aged, cold-sober men stood squarely in
front of a machine that might have been
a cross between an old-fashioned hurdy-
gurdy and a wornout phonograph. They
neither spoke nor smiled, but at sixpence
a pop, with the choice of canned Bing
or Frankie, they obviously thought they
were having a whale of a good time. I
was marvelling at their strange, silent
rapture when an elderly seafaring man
entered, as typical a small-craft man as
W. W. Jacobs ever described. He strode
purposefully to the counter and ordered
a malted milk —with raspberry. The last
bubble coaxed, by skilful manipulation,
down the side of the glass, he beckoned
the girl and gave another order. His
magnanimous “Keep the change” was
uttered with the air of a Nuffield and,
with the smugly complacent expression
of a man who had sated himself with
reckless high-living, he strode out of the
shop—licking a “thruppenny ice-cream.”
* * * *
“F.S.”; Professor Burke, the new Pro-
fessor of Fine Arts in Melbourne, de-
plored at a luncheon the way art was
taught in Victorian schools. I’m with
him; but whom would the professor
choose as teachers? Recently the State
Education Department included in its
curriculum a much more elaborate course
in art than it had ever had before, but it
forgot to supply artists as instructors.
Most teachers accepted the course as just
another thing to be drummed into pupils
out of textbooks, like mathematics or
spelling, but one got up at a conference
between teachers and department, and,
after praising that institution’s excellent
intentions with regard to the new sub-
ject, asked the pertinent question “Who
is to teach it?” “Well, I suppose you
are,” said a high official. “But I know
nothing about it,” said .the teacher.
* * * *
“Yair”; The rounding-up of unlicensed
barrows is a chequered business in
Sydney. A truck with two cops
aboard did the block twice one
day while I was waiting for a
tram. The secofid time, a barrow—
empty—came smartly up the street
and went triumphantly ahead of the
police-truck, the barrowman pointing to
the emptiness and shouting to the cops,
“Beat you that time! ” An elderly lady
near me murmured, “I don’t think the
policemen want to catch the poor fel-
lows. Maybe they only want to buy
something from them.”
* * * *
“Harold Hardupp”; Sydney shop-
keepers who have been fined for selling
wax matches have some ground for com-
plaint ; the sudden reappearance of the
waxies during the war must have been
with the toleration of the Government.
The sudden awakening of the Law must
have surprised the traders. In former
days the waxie .was the man’s match ; he
scornfully left safeties to the missus. One
masculine accomplishment was striking
matches on the seat of his pants. There
was a long campaign against the wax
vestas on humanitarian grounds; it was
said the workers who made them were
liable to develop “phossy jaw.” More
potent causes of the banning were the
number of fires that were traced to
matches which flared up when rats, mak-
ing a banquet on the wax sticks, reached
the business end, and the annoyance
caused to people and authorities who
hated to see their walls criss-crossed
with match scratchings. “Do not
strike matches on the wall” was once
a common .sign.
* * * *
“Craiser”: Meaning to be compli-
mentary, a Melbourne critic remarked
in a foreword to a memorial exhibition
that he had on more than one occasion
heard L the artist exclaim with pleasure
at the sight of the “meaningless” puddle
of color on a palette; “Oh, what an ex-
citing palette!” This reminds me of an
artist I once met in Paris. He had such
a love of paint for its own sake that he
slopped it all over his studio. When he
was painting he walked up and down in
front of his easel with the pigment over
his bare feet, and when he wanted a par-
ticular color he would bend down and
dip his brush into a puddle,
* $ * »
“Spooffie”: Years ago Parramatta had
two “ghosts.” A white-clad figure roamed
nightly around the roads outside the
town and caused alarm among young
girls. Efforts failed to solve the mystery
until a resident remembered the value of
a shot-gun loaded with grape-shot. For
a week a blacksmith failed to
turn up at work, and friends spent hours
picking slugs out of his back. In the
other case a “haunted” house was un-
occupied for months ; then a mute and
his family rented it at a nominal sum,
chiefly to prevent vandals removing it
piecemeal. Of course that family “never
heard nothin’.” The ghost moved on
somewhere else, and the rent was raised
to its former level.
* * * *
“Mer”; Strike fever doesn’t take long
to get into native blood. To Torres Strait
came a party of American scientists
to make some special biological observa-
tions, and they sent word in advance ask-
ing various island officials to engage
native labor. The regular rate then was
half-a-crown a day and tucker, plus
tobacco, and teams were duly selected. At
the first island where the party was to stay
for a week they flung the cash round
lavishly, handing out two or three times
more than had been agreed upon. When
they arrived at the next group of islands,
dropped anchor and waited for their stuff
to be carried ashore the natives delivered
an ultimatum; “Yu fella pay Mabuiag
man six and seven bob ; we better than
Mabuiag man, we want ten bob! ” Dol-
lars being no object, the Americans ac-
cepted the increase. After that it was a
long time before things got anywhere
near normal.
ALONE THEY DID IT.
"In single-handed combat the Red Army crushed
Hitler’s Germany, liberated the oppressed nations
of Europe, and victoriously terminated the war."
— “Pravda” (Moscow).
To me, although of Uncle Joe
I’m far from a belittler,
It’s always seemed, I must admit,
Some other nations did their bit
To cook the goose of Hitler.
Yet every view’s entitled to
Be heard —you can’t forbid it —
And, ever, as an obvious
Truth, it’s impressed upon the Russ,
Alone, alone he did it.
He got the Hun upon the run.
They tell him, single-handed;
No emphasis upon the fact
He waited till he was attacked
Presumably demanded.
While others bore the shocks of war,
The bashings and the blitzes,
His weight upon the fence was thrown,
Yet note that, later, h'e alone,
Alone knocked out the Fritzes.
Who walloped out, d’you think, the Kraut?.
Well, little foresight’s needed
To guess the Muscovite, by dint
Of reading it so oft in print.
Will rest assured that he did.
And in the Slav schoolbooks they have
I’m game to bet a quid it
Will be enshrined for evermore
Alike that Ivan won the war
And that alone he did it.

THE SERVICE MAN
War Medals.
There were numerous omissions of
fact, as usual, in daily-press summaries
of the conditions under which war medals
are to be granted.
Army personnel are eligible for the
1939-45 Star, the Africa Star, the Pacific
or Burma Star, the Italy Star, the France
and Germany or Atlantic or Air Crew
Eurojfe Star.
The 1939-45 Star is for operational
service from Sept. 3, 1939, to Sept. 2,
1945. Service from May 8, 1945, to
Sept. 2, 1945, must have been in the
Pacific war area. Service in Palestine,
Sinai and India (excluding Burma and
the North-West Frontier) is not count-
able. The period of service must have
been at least 180 days, or must be made
up of operational service in specified
areas —Greece and Crete (March 10-
May 31, 1941) and Syria (June 8 to July
11, 1941). Those who in a relevant
area won the honor or award, died on
“You carry on with 'rounds,’ Prendergast—this
three-card trick is easy money for me.”
service or were evacuated sick are not
subject to the time limit.
Australians are eligible who served in
the following O.P. areas:
France, Sept. 3, 1939, to May 9, 1940.
N. Africa (West of Suez), and Central
Pacific, June 10, 1940, to May 12, 1943.
Borneo and Sarawak, Dec. 31, 1941, to
Sept. 2, 1945.
Moluccas (Morotai), Jan. 30, 1942, to Sept.
2, 1945.
Philippines, Dec. 10, 1942, to Sept. 2, 1945.
Solomons, Feb. 1, 1942, to Sept. 2, 1945.
Timor, Feb. 20, 1942, to Sept. 2, 1945.
Java, March 5, 1942, to Sept. 2, 1945.
New Guinea, March 7, 1942, to Sept. 2,
1945.
Greece, June 11, 1943, to May 8, 1945.
Europe, June 6, 1944, to May 8, 1945.
This is, of course, all subject to the six
months’ qualification. There seems to be
a somewhat curious omission here which
affects those boys who were in Rabaul
and other parts of the New Guinea Terri-
tory (sometimes fighting desperately) in
January, 1942. It is a pity that the Gov-
ernments have not struck a special medal
or added a special clasp to an existing
ribbon for the Malaya campaign to
mark those who were in it as men apart.
The Africa Star
This is awarded for service in North
Africa from June 10, 1940, to May 12,
1943, with the Eighth Army clasp for
service in the Alamein campaign and the
First Army clasp for service in Tunis
and Algeria.
The Pacific Star goes for service be-
tween December 8, 1941, and September
2, 1945.
A recipient of the 1939-45 Star who
has qualified for it by active operational
service of less than six months {i.e„
through honors or taking part in a special
campaign) must have completed the six
months’ period before beginning to
qualify for other operational medals.
P.-0.-w. service counts for the 1939-45
but not necessarily for other operational
area stars, and does not count for the
Defence Medal.
Service for different stars, incidentally,
cannot be concurrent.
The Defence Medal
This was instituted for non-operational
and civil-defence service during the war.
It is granted for three years’ service in
non-operational areas subject to air
attack or closely threatened. The period
is shortened to three months for mine-
and bomb-disposal squads, or for one
year of operational service overseas from,
or outside, Australia, or six months in
territories subjected to enemy air attack
or closely threatened, specified islands in
non-operational areas being mentioned in
the schedule.
Papua and the Mandated Territory are
not “outside Australia.” Territories
classified as NOP areas subjected to air
attack or closely threatened include North
Africa (May 13, 1943, to
May 8, 1945), Palestine
(September 3, 1939, to
May 8, 1945), Syria and
Lebanon (September 3,
1939, to June 7, 1941, and
July 12, 1941,,t0 May 8,
1945), Ceylon (September
3, 1939, to May 8, 1945),
Fiji islands (September 3,
1939, to September 2,
1945), Northern Terri-
tory, north of lat. 14, 30
deg. south (September 3,
1939, to September 2,
1945) —six months only,
unless resident there prior
to September 3, 1939, in
which case service must
be for three years. This
seems an unfair and
extraordinary distinction.
A candidate who lived
half a mile south of lat.
14, 30 deg. and who
walked across the sacred
borderline to serve in
Daywin (bombed) took
three years to qualify;
one who lived a hundred
yards inside the sacred
border and / served an
earnest six months in the
Larrimah area, in serious
danger of nothing worse
than being run over by
a beer wagon, gets his
medal.
The War Medal is to
be granted for 28 days’
continuous service during
the war, and is in addi-
tion to campaign stars and Defence
Medal, if earned. The bronze oak leaf
M.I.D. can be worn with it.
"Australia First" and the
Army.
“Ek Dum”: Replying to A. M. Blain,
M.P., the Army Minister said in Parlia-
ment that there would be no further in-
quiry into the cases of the Australia
First men.
Mr. Chambers admitted that, while the
Clyne inquiry was in progress, Colonel
Prentice, Chief Intelligence Officer of the
Military Forces ip N. S. Wales, had
written to Corporal Downe, one of the
internees, had expressed personal confi-
dence in him and had mentioned arrange-
ments to transfer him to Cipher Branch,
one of the most secret branches of the
Army.
This information, the Minister said,
was not placed before Justice Clyne be-
cause the inquiry was connected with
“events more than two years before." A
despicable excuse.
Whether the events were two years or
20 years before, anybody with the
slightest sense of justice would have made
the facts known to the Judge regarding
a soldier who actually was in the front-
line during most of the inquiry.
As it was, the Security Department
made every post a winner. No innuendo
against the unfortunates who were virtu-
ally on trial was omitted. Half-sentences
out of long reports were submitted as
opinions. Opinions spoken in 1936 and
1937, and taken straight out of the mouth
of Mr. Forde at that time, were held up


Personal.

as the most appalling examples of dis-
loyalty.
Mr. Chamber’s statement is particu-
larly disgraceful in view of the follow-
ing facts: —
(1) Downe was, a member of the A.I.F.
when he Was interned. He was interned
in uniform.
(2) He asked for a court-martial. His
unit commander could find nothing to
justify one, and neither could the higher
authorities of the Army.
And yet the Security Department, two
years afterwards, alleged that at the time
it suspected him to be one of the leaders
of a conspiracy to subvert the A.1.F., to
welcome the Japanese to Australia, to
sabotage defence facilities so as to make
defence of the country impossible, and
to assassinate public men.
Downe remained in uniform through-
out the period of his internment, and
then drew military pay for the whole of
that period.
Immediately after he was released he
was passed out of the Army, but —
apparently on the intervention of Dr.
Evatt —he was immediately allowed to re-
enlist.
Mr. Chambers’s® statement amounts to
disgraceful evasion. And the idea that
Army Intelligence would appoint to the
Cipher Branch a man against whom two
years before there had been “evidence”
to suggest that he was engaged in a dread-
ful conspiracy of treason and assassina-
tion is Gilbertian, or would be Gilbertian
in any other but a Communist-ridden
country.
Mr. Chambers added that it was not
known whether the statement by his pre-
decessor in 1942 regarding the Australia
First case§ Was a paraphase of the official
text of the Moscow trials of the Rights
and Trotskyites in 1938. Actually, it in-
cluded some of its words and phrases.
In any event, the matter of Downe is
not the worst of the Australia First cases
which the Government is so anxious to
forget. Worse was the martyrdom of
Watts, a wounded and decorated soldier
of the first Great War. The Army must
have gone into his record hot long before
his internment. It had accepted him as a
volunteer instructor in the Militia for
several years. It appointed him a peace
officer guarding the most important ex-
plosives factory in Australia. In this posi-
tion he had been thanked for his vigilance
in preventing a dangerous fire. That was
only a few days before his arrest.
Watt died in Prince of Wales Hospital,
Sydney, while the Australia First inquiry
was in progress. He lived just long
enough to know that the Security De-
partment did not have one word of, evi-
dence to offer in support of its alle-
gation that it had believed him a traitor
when it interned him. At the inquiry it
pronounced him a loyal and decent citi-
zen.
His widow was left almost destitute.
The Commonwealth “Government,” its
“principles” (so-called) based on mate-
ship and the brotherhood of man, gave
her a whole £4OO compensation. It
would not one-tenth have paid for her
agony of mind, much less have paid her
for the loss of her helpmate, cruelly sac-
rificed by the Government to which he
had given faithful service.
Military Attache in Russia.
“Ek Dum”: At the risk of laboring a
subject which should be of more than
academic interest to the Government, it
must be stated that the world continues
to drift nearer to a state of war, or war
in Europe and Asia, produced by the
policy of Russia.
There is no drift in the policy of that
country; it was bitterly unfriendly even
while Britain and the United States were
risking their existence to save the U.S.S.R.
If there was ever any doubt of that it
has been set at rest by Major-General
John R. Deane, who was United States
military attache in Moscow during the
perilous years 1943-45. In view of what is
happening wherever Russia treads, there
is some consolation in his reports on
Russian “efficiency” but not a great deali
General Deane furnishes proof of
everything stated in this paper about
the nature of Russian campaigning. It
is clear from his report that if the
Russians had depended on technical skill
and their own mechanisation, their war
would not have lasted much longer than
the period when they and their agents
all the world over were squealing for
aid from hard-pressed Britain, with less
than one-fourth of their population.
He shows that the Russians played the
same game with their Allies as M. Molo-
t;,iv plays at U.N.O. conferences —were
surly and suspicious until their opposite
numbers were at breaking point and then
came up smiling, “complete with vodka
and caviar.” While the U.S.A. was arm-
ing Russia, desperately short of every-
thing, its military attache was snubbed
continually—and in “a continual state
of high dudgeon.”
About the only time the entente cor-
diale worked was when U.S. fliers
landed on Russian soil before the United
States entered the war. They were taken
to frontiers and allowed to escape. In
normal relations there was “only grudging
co-operation, with hardly a trace of good-
will.” U.S. aircraft which came down in
Russian territory while engaged on bomb-
ing missions against the Germans, in the
interests of the Russian front, were seized
and taken over by the Red Air ‘Force
without a word of explanation.
When the first squadrons of Flying
Fortresses arrived in the Ukraine, their
dimensions and equipment staggered the
Russians, who had never seen anything
like them. Sent to co-operate with the
Red Army, the first squadrons were
bombed out of existence for lack of radar,
which the Russians did not possess on
their air fields.
The Russians, General Deane now
makes it plain, refused to allow the Ameri-
cans to establish their own radar on the
ground that it would “interfere with Red
Army radio communication”—a silly
reason with no technical justification
whatever.
Before the shuttle-bombing bases, which
saved thousands of lives, were established
in the Ukraine to enable attacks in sup-
port of the Red Army which had been
agreed on, every element of Russian
officialdom resisted the arrangement for
months.
Much of the trouble, however, the
general puts down to plain surly bureau-
cratic incompetence.
General Deane cites a case in which
the Russians asked for instruction in the
use of the U.S. Norden bombsight —the
outside world incidentally was told that
Russian bombsights made all others look
like toys, though use of them did not
suggest that they consisted of anything
much beyond a piece of string. Uncle Sam
had promptly agreed to make the sight
available —this was in July, 1944, when
a point had been reached at which Russia
had consented to a bombing policy for
the eastern front.
He obliged also with a team of in-
structors, sent at the request of the Red
Army.
The Soviet Foreign Office held up the
passports of the team for three months.
When the teachers arrived they were told
they would be allowed only 72 hours to
instruct the Red Army men. They asked
the U.S. Army to send them a Liberator
to facilitate teaching. The U.S. Army
again obliged. Soviet officials refused to
allow it to enter Russia.
The Russians were almost destitute of
tires and the means of making them.
Their need was so urgent that the United
States Government bought Ford’s tire
plant at River Rouge, Michigan, and
shipped it —a £2,000,000 assembly—
bodily to Russia, absorbing much use-
ful shipping in the process and, of course,
arranging British and American convoy
protection at a time when naval resources
were strained (1943). Extra equipment,
including a power plant, was sent in
1944. The Russians left the machinery
standing in the snow while they argued
about blueprints and locations.
Then a team of U.S. experts was sent
to hasten construction, A year I'ater they
left Russia in despair. Nothing had be'en
done except talk.

PERSONAL ITEMS
Killed recently in an aircraft accident,
Major-General Paul B. Wurtsmith will
be remembered as C.O. of the first
American fighter unit to go into action
in Australia. Kittyhawks of his 49th
Fighter Group based in and around Dar-
win met enemy aircraft early in 1942,
arid there he laid the foundations that
made the 49th one of the most efficient
fighter units in the S.-W. Pacific area. By
April, 1944, the group had destroyed
close on 400 Japanese aircraft and had
made a reputation for themselves by the
accuracy of their bombing and strafing
in support of Seventh Divvy in the Ramu
Valley. Wurtsmith by that time was
Commanding General at U.S. Fifth
Fighter Command, with control over all
American and Australian fighter squad-
rons in New Guinea. That the landings
at Nassau Bay, Hopoi, Scarlet Beach,
Arawe, Saidor, Cape Gloucester and the
Admiralties and the air invasion of Nad-
zab took place with little or no interfer-
ence from enemy aircraft was due in no
small part to his planning. Paul Wurt-
smith had a lot of time for Australia and
Australians, and Australians who met him
had a lot of time for him.
Two Victorians are listed amongst the
awards of British Empire Mefials to
servicemen who made repeated at-
tempts to escape from German
Stalags. They are David Bristol,
ex-2/sth Battalion, and Joseph Wishart,
of Rainbow, formerly of the 2/6th Bat-
talion—both Sixth Divvy men. Bristol
escaped eight times from working and
punishment camps, generally only for a
few days, though on one occasion he
kept the German guards guessing until
he reached the Swiss frontier. He is now
a salesman at St. Kilda, Wishart, cap-
tured in Crete, was imprisoned in Austria,
persistently escaped and was recaptured
until on the sixth attempt he succeeded
two days before the Italian capitulation.
He now runs a men’s - wear shop at
Rainbow. A Mention in Dispatches
went to Sergeant A. C. Clarke, of Kew,
though he never escaped himself. As
chairman of an Escape Committee he
was too busy arranging the escapes of
comrades and getting escape material
from the British War Office through vari-
ous channels. Over 200 got their liberty
through his ministrations.
A colorful individual was Charles
Archibald Hoadley, C.8.E., M.Sc.,
8.M.E., principal of Footscray Technical
School, dead in Melbourne at 59.
He had held the Tech, job for 31 years,
and for many years had been on the
board, and recently managing director,
of his father’s firm, Hoadley’s Chocolates,
Ltd. After graduating from Melbourne
University, he joined Mawson’s Antartic
expedition of 1911-13. Oh his return he
was given a research scholarship in
geology and was senior lecturer in the
School of Mines at Ballarat. Joining the
Boy Scouts in 1919, Hoadley became
Chief Victorian Scout in 1927. He was
Commissioner in Charge of the Aus-
tralian Contingent to the 21st birthday
Jamboree in England in 1929, He was
made C.B.E. in 1936.
Charles Merrett has resigned the presi-
dency of the R.A.S. in Melbourne after
putting through the 76th report of that
great organisation. He wanted to resign
last year but was asked to stay until the
first post - war Show was held in more
than its pre-war splendor of brawn, beef
and muscle. Merrett has steered the State’s
greatest open-air entertainment through
32 years, excluding the ones when the
Showgrounds were given over to the Air
Force, and has been a member of the
council since 1902. He joined the De-
fence Forces in 1880 and commanded
the 10th, 11th, and 29th Light Horse regi-
ments, retiring with the rank of colonel.
He was knighted in 1934 and made C.B.E.
two years later. He will still have plenty
of chairmanships to occupy him, being
president of the S.P.C.A., the Kennel
Control Council and the Young Farmers’
Clubs which are spreading modern know-
ledge of agriculture through the country,
as well as being a member of a score of
other committees.
Roy Gilmore Ellis, who succeeds A.
D. Mason as Dean of the Faculty of
Dentistry at the Toronto Uni., Canada,
is S.A.-born and a graduate of Adelaide
Uni. He collected his dental-surgery de-
gree in Canada in 1929, was awarded a
Fellowship of the American College of
Dentistry last year, and during the war
served with the Canadian Dental Corps.
He’s 40.
Heber A. Longman, first Queenslander
to be awarded the Australian Natural
History Medallion, was for many years
director of the Queensland Museum,
where his notable work on the osteology
of prehistoric Australian animals attracted
world-wicie scientific attention. Instituted
in 1940, the award has been made an-
nually by the Field Naturalists’ Club of
Victoria in conference with a committee
representing some 30 scientific societies
throughout Australia, The medallion will
be presented to Longman through
the Royal Society of Queensland, of
which he is a past president.
Another record established by the ver-
satile Bennett family is the appointment
of Arnold L. Bennett, brother of Air
Vice - Marshal D. C. T. Bennett, as a
King’s Counsel, at 38 the youngest K.C.
in Queensland’s legal history. Born at
Toowoomba, A.L.B. graduated in Arts
in 1931 and was admitted to the Queens-
land Bar in 1932.
If Australia has a tendency to go to
Maoriland for heads to run Scotch
colleges, M.L. educational establishments
have a predilection for English and
Scotch teachers with experience in Aus-
tralia. The newly - created Chair of
Botany at Wellington Victoria College
has been filled by Prof. H. D. Gordon
of Tasmanian Uni. A product of Edin-
burgh Uni. he is 34 and lectured on
botany at Edinburgh and Liverpool be-
fore he went to Tassie in 1937. The
chair of ' English and classics at Auck-
land Urii. College, vacant since the resig-
nation of Prof. W. A. Sewell, has been
filled by Dr. S. Musgrave, a former Eng-
lish and classics lecturer at Armidale
College (N.S.W.). A native of Derby,
England, he’s an Oxford man and went
to Armidale in 1939.
This is J. V. Barry, K.C., whose recent
appointment as a judge of the Supreme
Court was very popular with the legal fra-
ternity of Melbourne, as they realise that
his wide and varied experience in all
jurisdictions will give him a more than
ordinary understanding of their problems.
He was a foundation member, and has
JUDGE.
been secretary, of the Medico-Legal
Society of Victoria, member of the Bar
Committee of the Vic. Board of
Legal Examiners, of the Supreme Court
Library Committee and of the Aliens
Classification and Advisory Committee,
and he did a great deal of royal-com-
mission work. When Eugene Gorman
was appointed Australian Consul-General
to the N.E.I. Justice Barry was named as
his counsellor, but the Japs knocked the
bottom out of that by occupying Java.
Dr. McArtney, awarded the M.D. by
Adelaide Uni. for eye-disease work, was
born in N.S.W., but has been in Adelaide
most of his life. He did post-graduate
work in London, and now assists Prof.
Stanton Hicks in the physiology side of
Adelaide Uni.
A. D. McCutcheon, president of the
Methodist Conference in Adelaide, was
a pit boy in Durham before coming to
S.A. 35 years ago. Since then he has
ministered at Keith, Broken Hill, and on
the soldier settlements along the Murray.
For 12 years he has been super-
intendent of the Port Adelaide Methodist
Mission, where he has established a
£7OOO physiotherapy clinic as a memorial
to his wife, who was awarded the M.B.E.
for her work at the seaport. He’s an
Old Digger, and a trustee of the R.S.L.
headquarters in S.A.
Max Plate, depicted here by Heth, is
an Australian who, finding himself in
London at the outbreak of war, offered
to give the R.N. a helping hand for the
duration. After a suitable display of re-
luctance the navy took him up, put him
on a merchant cruiser and then passed
him on to the Third Submarine Flotilla
which prowled the seas from the Bay of
Biscay to the Northern Lights. At the
war’s end he joined up with U.N.R.R.A.
U.N.R.R.A.
and was placed in charge of its activities
at Straubing, east of Munich, in the
American Zone. One of his biggest head-
aches was the problem of “displaced per-
sons.” He doesn’t claim to havb solved
it, for faster than war-displaced persons
could be re-directed to their former homes
peace-displaced persons from Eastern
Europe poured into the zone. When he
left there a few weeks ago the p.d.ps.
were still gaining.
“Mitre”: The Right Rev. Dr. J. Feet-
ham, Bishop of N.Q., sick in a Brisbane
hospital for many months, must hold a
unique position in the training of bishops.
Halse, promoted to Riverina, later to
Archbishop of Brisbane, was the first of
his bright young men to go. Thomas,
Bishop of Willochra, came from his team.
Robin, now of Adelaide, served under
John N. Q. And now Moline, latest
archbishop of Perth, must surely make
Feetham’s already unassailable position
still safer. Our old Bishop—as we call
him —may think, pray and preach like a
father of bishops, but he doesn’t look
and talk like one. It is his human quali-
ties as an ordinary man that have en-
deared him to his flock for over 30 years.
“H.M.”: Anyone beat this? Thomas
Hogg, managing director of James Miller
and Co., rope makers, Melbourne, has
been 77 years in his job. He joined as
an office boy at 13 and he has been
entertained by his fellow-directors on
attaining his 90th year.
This face pinned down on paper by
Mcßeath which looks as though it should

Peel, head of the United Kingdom dele-
gation to Picao. Typical of a stay-at-
home Englishman, he was born in Ire-
land, educated at Cheltenham and in
Switzerland, and trained in the textile
business in Alexandria, Egypt, where his
father has a cotton factory. Disdain-
ing textiles, he bought a ’plane, learnt
to fly, and entered the civil aviation de-
partment at the age of 27. He flew with

he has an individuality beneath a quiet
exterior.
Passed on at Bowen (Q.), Alfred Vindex
Vennard, prolific writer of bush and
Barrier Reef stories. Born 'on Vindex
station 61 years ago, he had a long
acquaintance with the Bush before he
went to Gallipoli with the A.I.F. From
the Peninsula he sent his impressions to
the “Daily Mail” and the “Star,” and
later to The Bulletin. With the Camel
Corps he saw much of the desert fighting
and was severely wounded, and after con-
valescence he edited the “Kia-Ora Coo-ee,”
an A.I.F. sheet, remembered by Old
Diggers. Back in Australia he put in
a couple of years with “Smith’s Weekly,”
then went north and settled down in
Bowen. For nearly a quarter of a cen-
tury his weekly “On the Track” page has
been a feature of the “Northern Register”
and the Townsville “Daily Bulletin.” To
readers of those papers he was “Bill Bow-
yang” ; as “Frank Reid” he published an
entertaining book based on his experi-
ences with the Camel Corps.
Into the silence;
Vvn. Joseph Pike, Archdeacon of Goulbum
and Vicar-General of the Diocese. Ordained in
1894, he served in a number of parishes m
North Queensland, came to Goulburn with
Bishop Barlow in 1902 and had since held
many offices in the diocese.
In Adelaide, at 57, James Robert Beattie
Love, anthropologist, missionary and Modera-
tor of the Presbyterian Church of S.A. First
trained as a schoolteacher, he completed his
theological course in 1919, and afterwards
worked among the abos in the Gulf of Car-
pentaria, the north-west coast of Westralia,
and as Superintendent of Emabella Mission.
He translated four gospels into the Worora dia-
lect, and was the author of Stone Age Bushmen
of Today. In World War I he won the M.C.
and the D.C.M.
In Sydney, at 63, Jacques Playoust, of the
wool firm that bears the family name. In
World War I, though born in Australia, he
served with the French forces and took part
in the defence of Verdun. With a Medaille
Militaire on his tunic he came to Australia on
sick leave and returned to France with the
A.I.F. as interpreter with 13th Field Artillery.
He saw the war out with them and collected a
D.C.M.
In Adelaide, Mrs. A. K. Goode, who de-
voted her life to public affairs —‘from politics to
kindergartens. She became the first woman
councillor in S.A. in 1925, and as a J.P. was
the first to take her seat on the bench with
a stipendiary magistrate.
In Sydney at 89, George Dean, who came
to Australia in 1880 with George Musgrove
and for over 40 years was a prominent figure
on the Australian stage. He appeared at the
opening of Sydney Criterion in 1880 and in
1935 when the old Cri. was demolished he
emerged from retirement to speak the last words
on its stage.
In Brisbane, at 63, Edward Thynne Real,
only son of the late Justice Real, and himself
a leading member of the Queensland Bar for
many years.
Jn Adelaide, at 54, Lloyd Southcott, for-
merly of the firm of Southcott, Ltd., engineers,
and founder of the Standard Trading Company.
He served with the 10th Battalion in World
War I.


WOmen's letters
From Melbourne
Sir Winston and Lady Dugan enter-
tained country visitors at a late-afternoon
party, tall bowls of pink Allies, gladioli
and hydrangeas making a glorious splash
of color against the pastel tinted walls
of the State drawing-room. Lady Dugan
received her guests wearing a frock of
black coarse-meshed net with a wide hem
band and sash of black satin, the same
material also outlining the yoke and
sleeves. Assisting in entertaining the
guests were Mrs. J. O. Haselden, who
wore an attractive frock of navy-and-
white printed silk; Penelope Nettlefold,
whose vivid red silk-linen frock featured
wide Dutch pockets at the hips ; and Mrs.
G. C. Maxwell, whose frock was of pat-
terned sapphire-blue and white. Rose-
mary Norrie chose a grey-and-white pat-
terned frock of crepe. An all-white en-
semble with original lattice-work trim-
ming on the frock was worn by Mrs.
Maurice Nicholas. Mrs. Trevor Clarke’s
white frock was patterned in blue and
lime-green with a white-feather hat,
finished with a bandeau of green silk fall-
ing softly to the shoulders.
Although drenching rain had fallen
all Saturday morning at Flemington,
women, scorning raincoats, came out in
the new season’s suits and topcoats.
There are no in-between jacket lengths
—either they are shorter or longer than
the ones worn last autumn. The small
jackets are fitted and adorned with attrac-
tive and original buttons, and the longer
jackets are nipped in at the waist. Skirts
appear to have become a little longer.
The new season’s hats have height,
although the bowler is still favored by
many smart women. These hats are even
more attractive when worn with a veil
which covers the face and is tied under
the chin.
Lady Dugan, who came with Sir Win-
ston, chose a striking lobelia-blue tweed
suit, over which she wore a matching
topcoat lined with vivid red cloth. Her
navy-blue hat had a swept-up brim and
a high crown. Rosemary Norrie,
daughter of the Governor of S.A. —
she is staying at G.H. —wore a beige-
and-brown flecked suit with a brown
beret caught with a diamond star. With
her was Penelope Nettleford, who had
a “jockey cap” to go with an olive-
green suit. Mrs. Cain’s small veiled red
hat was worn. well off the face with a
matching red suit collared in silver fox
furs. Mrs. George Jones, wife of the
Air-Marshal, was smart in a grey-and-blue
checked suit worn with a cornflower-blue
hat, flower-trimmed. Mrs. Rupert
Downes wore a silver-grey tweed frock
under a long matching coat, the
lapels of which were formed of grey
Indian lamb. Her postillion hat of red
was tied with a grey-and-white spotted
scarf. Three well-suited youngsters out
for the day’s racing were Dorita Mc-
Donald (Mt. Gambier), Shirley Watts and
Judith Silk. Newly-engaged Helen Lane,
trim in beige linen, came with fiance
Wyndham Hill Smith, who hails from
Adelaide. Mrs. Les Coleman, who wore
a Paisley silk frock under a tailored coat,
was especially happy, for her son Kevin,
after five years’ service with the A.1.F.,
finished his First Year Law course by.
carrying off the Exhibition in Contract
Law—which has been performed only
twice in 20 years by a first-year student.
Miss McKinnon, energetic secretary io
the Australian Wool Board, has revealed
that Rodier, famous French manufac-
turer, has produced a mousseline of wool
which is as sheer as a silk mousseline.
The big fashion houses are now using it
to make exquisite dinner gowns cut on
full, flowing lines, with matching sleeves
caught in to tight wristlet cuffs. Some of
these mousselines are printed in modernist
patterns of cinnamon-brown and black
on pastel-blue grounds, and also floral
patterns reminiscent of old-fashioned
chintzes and Victorian wallpaper featur-
ing deep red roses with green leaves on
pale tea-rose yellow grounds. An-
other manufacturer, Jacques Lesur, has
launched a line of printed woollens on a
more closely-textured material. Although
lightweight, it is heavier than mousseline
and falls like a crepe. Shells, polka-dots,
seagulls and sailing ships printed in white
are set on color-stippled backgrounds
which feature several tones of the same
color —these are for beach wear. Leading
shades in the French fashion picture are
soft greens, lime, eucalyptus, lichen and
tender spring-leaf greens, followed by
every imaginable shade of yellow from
cream and straw yellows to lemon, canary
and a bold sunflower. Grey and beige are
also prominent, for neutral shades are
popular. Pastel-pink and blues lean to-
wards mauve, and there are touches of
true violet also, used as trimmings or for
evening wear. Color combinations are
new and uelicate. Yellow and grey,
pastel-blue with tan or cinnamon, tan
with eucalyptus-green and tobacco-brown
with pastel pink, maroon and pale blue
or soft lime green, navy-blue and lime
and blotting paper-pink and violet are
just a few of the color harmonies which
combine in striped as well as checked
material,
Clare Cooper, who married Dr. Frank
May in the old-world church of St.
Helena, Greensborough, this week, will
have a busy time trying out the many
recipes she gathered at a tea-party given
by her sister, Mrs. Dermot Connelly.
The home of Lord Mayor Ray Connelly
was the setting for the party, and his
sister-in-law filled the house with bowls
of lovely flowers, and arranged them also
on the table where afternoon tea was set.
Mrs. Connelly wore a striking frock of
deep burgundy silk patterned in black
and white fern sprays. The guest of
honor pinned a spray of roses on her
beige crepe ensemble, which was worn
with a small black hat. Mother of Clare,
Mrs. E. Watson, wore black. Smart
women guests present included Mrs. Alan
Walters, cool-looking in a white linen
frock and large red straw picture-hat,
and Air-Commodore Sherger’s wife,
Jill, who chose a softly-patterned pastel-
blue frock with white accessories. An-
other in an all-white outfit was Mrs. Dan
Reddan.
White heather sent from Scotland was
fastened to the trailer of flowers attached
to' the 50-years-old prayerbook carried
by Betty Stewart, pictured here, when
she married Ronald Keith Findlay at
Scots Church. Ceremony was performed
by the Rev. J. Crichton Barr —his first
since he arrived from Scotland. Betty is
the only child of the late Mr, J. P.
Stewart and of Mrs. L. M. Dunne, of St.
Kilda-road. She was given away by Mr.
Leonard Liscombe. Betty’s wedding
gown was of blue French lame, woven
with a silver thread and made with a
draped bodice, finished with a knot of
material at each shoulder and a flared
skirt extended to form a train. Her
matching shoulder-length tulle veil was
caught to the head with a floral coronet
mounted on pink and blue velvet. Kath
Hays was a decorative bridesmaid;
Charles Wallman attended the bride-
groom, who is the only son of the late
Mr. and Mrs. John Riddell Findlay,
formerly of Northcote. Mrs. Dunne, who
received the guests at a dinner party at
9 Darling-street, wore a long full skirt
of light burgundy crepe allied to a bodice
trimmed with blue and silver bugle beads.
It was worn with a short matching jacket,
and her small black silk straw hat was
trimmed with pastel flowers. Mrs. H. A.
Youlden chose a black georgette dinner
gown which featured the new full bishop
sleeves. Her daughter, Mrs. Desmond
Connor, had a sequin-trimmed yoke on
her long pastel-pink crepe gown. Mrs.
M. Hewison was in black, with gold em-
broideries set at the sleeves, waist and
neckline. Mrs. N. O’Kane wore a floral
taffeta gown patterned in mauve and
pale yellow pansies.
An informal luncheon party was given
by Mrs. Ella Marcovitz in honor of her
Melbourne hostess, Mrs. John Langley.
The Gloucester Room at the Australia
was the setting. The hostess offset her
lime-green-and-black tie-silk frock with
a mushroom-shaped hat of shrimp-pink
straw with a green crown and pale-yellow
rose trimming. The guest-of-honor was
in an all-white ensemble. Win Wolfe
was another who chose white, her small
hat being a mixture of white and brown
straw with a small chou of brown ribbons
at the side. Mrs. C. Curtain was in dove
grey with a matching straw hat trimmed
with a posy of pastel-pink flowers. Alyce
Reid, just back from a seven months’ trip
to the U.S.A., was smart in black. Sophie
Graves was a symphony in beige and
brown.
From Sydney
The rain fell in long, stubborn, unre-
lenting spears on the decorated and the
undecorated alike when they sought the
gardens of Government House after the
Investiture last Wednesday morning.
The ceremony of presentation was digni-
fied and impressive and took place in the
ballroom. The Governor, Lieut-General
John Northcott, officiated on behalf of
the Acting Governor-General, Sir Winston
Dugan. Rear-Admiral Knight Leighton
Bracegirdle read the citations in im-
pressive tone.
Altogether there were 131 recipients
of honors, and as each is allowed to in-
vite two friends the ballroom was crowded.
Mrs. John Northcott’s silk frock was
checked in brown and beige tones, and
her small brown hat with its upturned
brim was corded with cream silk. Eliza-
beth Northcott wore a frock of jade-blue
crepe, and blue roses on her tiny straw
hat. Fljght-Lieut. M. D. Seale, the only
Australian decorated with th£ D.F.C.
and two bars, was among Wednesday’s
honored. So was Brigadier Denzil Mac-
arthur Onslow—his was the D.S.O. Little
Merle Mcllrick was there, too, receiving
the Military Medal awarded posthumously
to her father, Sergeant A. A, Mcllrick.
On Thursday morning there was
another Investiture. This time 128 deeds
of bravery and devotion to duty were
cited. Again the rain fell, but the
sun shone through every now and
again. Again the ballroom was thronged,
and again Mrs. Northcott and daughters
Elizabeth and Lieut. Marjorie Northcott,
gave family support to his Ex.
You have a chance not only to help
others but to help yourself if you give
generously to the Mt. Colah Home for
Ex-Servicemen Appeal. All donations
are free from income tax, and lower
assessments will be your reward on earth.
The committee is out for £500,000 to build
the home, and for setting aside for invest-
ment to finance the institution in the years
to come. This will be a convalescent
home for the soldier after discharge from
hospital, or a place for a holiday when
in a run-down or nervous condition.
The convalescents will be trained in
vegetable-growing, poultry-farming and
such healthy pursuits. Mt. Colah is 17
miles north of Sydney by rail via Horns-
by. The proposed site for the home (a
Government grant) is 700 ft. above sea
level and only a quarter of a mile from
Mt. Colah railway station. This really
is a chance to help build up the health
of the sick ex-serviceman of the Army,
the Navy and the Air Force.
Contralto Heather Kinnaird will be the
Berta of “The Barber of Seville” at the
A.B.C.’s copcert arrangement of this
opera at the Conservatorium on March
11. “Peter Grimes” is another of the
operas chosen for the season. Lute
Drummond, just out of Lewisham hos-
pital, is busy on the production side.
Photograph of Heather is from John Lee.
This Letter found her favorite milliner
crooning over some rolls of just-delivered-
from-Paris silk velvets, double-backed
satin ribbons and taffeta ribbons, soft
and scrunchy. Nineteen forty-seven Easter
hats are going to be even more important
than hats were in the years before the war.
And you can’t get away with last winter’s,
be it never so good, because hats no
longer perch or hover. They fit the
cranium. But don’t gather from that that
the new hats are shady. They are worn
pushed off the face, excepting the more
formal or picture hat, such as one in
soft periwinkle-blue felt which wore on
its straight brim four singly placed,
softly curled ostrich plumes of the same
hue,
A brown satin trifle bordered with
large size white violets, and a cornelian-
red stitched velvet, smooth fitting as to
crown, edged with roses, all hand-made
and each dyed separately so that the hues
blended from red to faint ashes of roses,
would bring a champagne glow to the
heart of any woman, though her palate
told her that her host’s cocktails were
poor stuff, indeed. Personal choice for
the races were a snappy bowler in black-
spotted white taffeta, the crown bound
with a grass-green ribbon, and a wood-
green felt, caught to its upswept side by
a knot of cerise ribbon. And if you are a
Mrs. Miniver who likes a veil, see that
yours has meshed here and there a Pier-
rot sized velvety black blob.
The Sydney Nursery Schools’ Associa-
tion plans to open a civic nursery right
in the city. This will be good news for
the young mother who has to do a day’s
shopping and yet wishes to feel that her
small children are receiving knowledge-
able and careful attention during her
absence. The scheme was received with
great applause when put forward at a
meeting in the Carlton Hotel last Wednes-
day morning. Mrs. W. P. McElhone,
devoted president of the Day Nursery
and the Nursery Schools’ Association, told
of the success of a similar nursery in
Brisbane. The Henry Braddon lady has
been elected president of the Appeal com-
mittee.
Leaks in the roof weren’t the only ones
talked about last Saturday, for the
Cymmrodorian Society of this State was
celebrating the feast of its country’s
patron —St. David. Four hundred mem-
bers of the society went out through the
driving rain to the Grace Auditorium for
a grand dinner party. The National
Anthem was sung and everybody, William
Morris Hughes included, joined in
the chorus. The tables were gay with
leeks and daffodils, and there was a
small Welsh hat for every guest. Presi-
dent B. Elystan-Price and secretary Miss
Katie Jones gave warm-hearted Welsh
words of greeting to each arrival.
By taxi, by foot, and by cars of great
price Victoria Leaguers made their way
to Government House last Friday morn-
ing to form themselves into a committee
to help raise Australia’s quota towards
the new Victoria League House in Lon-
don. One thousand pounds English is the
sum aimed at —£1250 Australian. It is
expected that in all £5OOO English will
go from Australia towards buying the
new club. This time the address will be
Belgrave House, Belgrave-square, which
was a former residence of Viscountess
Boyne, a sister-in-law of H.R.H. Princess
Royal.
A ball at the Trocadero on May 22
will glean the first silver harvest. Tickets
are a guinea each. Some stood out for
25 bob, but with their eyes on the V.L.’s
young contingent and its friends, the
majority decided on the guinea. There
will be a sparkling cluster of debs., a
bright floor show, and posies for sale.
Mrs. John Northcott was in the chair
for the beginning of the meeting. Later
on she had to leave to keep another
appointment, and Mrs. H. H. McNall
took over. Mrs. Roy Buckland com-
bined a pleasant manner and decisive
comments on the matter of the catering.
She’s a grand person on a committee. She
knew exactly what the Troc. could serve
for supper and the price of it, which
seems a very reasonable price indeed.
Mrs. Keith Morris offered some good
suggestions. The League’s own Beulah
Bolton dealt capably with all matters re-
ferred to her. And the cable from Lady
Gowrie, snug (in spite of the English
freeze, we hope) in Windsor Castle, was
listened to with rapt attention. It was
read by Mrs. Northcott:
Deeply touched by your generous offer
to help us with our Victoria League House.
We are inspired by the thought that it will
be a living memorial to our men and
women of Commonwealth and Empire who
have given their lives. My love and grati-
tude to you all. Zara Gowrie.
The Jordan lady is the president of the
committee, and Mrs. Allan Foott the
secretary. Publicity is in the hands of
Lois Graham.
Busy time ahead for concert manager
Barbara Bennett. She’s looking after
Gordon Watson’s three recitals before he
leaves for study with Egon Petri in
California. This gifted young ex-service-
man was runner-up in the A.B.C. con-
tests last year. Gordon’s first concert
is tonight at the Conservatorium; his
next is on the 15th and his final farewell
on the 26th in the same hall. Baritone
Robert Livingstone, whose associate artist
will be Teodora Stephens, is another on
Mrs. Bennett’s managerial list. His
recital is on the 13th. Then on the 12th
is mezzo-soprano Doris Scott’s concert
in conjunction with Doreen Price and
Joyce Hutchinson. The Con. is booked
for these also.
The Crown-street Women’s Hospital
will benefit by the Floral Ball at the
Trocadero on May 11. Tickets will be
priced at 15s. President of the committee
is Mrs. C. R. McKerihan, and there’s a
long list of Sydney’s well known on the
committee. Mrs. Dovey took the first
meeting in capable fashion. Next meet-
ing will be on March 19 in the Confer-
ence Room of the Rural Bank at 11
o’clock.

This co.’s scrip is one of the market
leaders in the industrial section. Here
prices for selected stocks have more or
less settled at a level showing returns be-
tween 2.5 p.c. and 3.5 p.c. according to
prospects. Since B.T.’s f.-p. pound ords.
sold at 575. 6d. in Dec., which was below
the old official limit. (595. 6d.), removal
of the ceiling had no effect on the price
of the scrip. The figure eased to 535.
6d. in January, when the Government
withdrew its subsidy to the industry and
the prices commissioner authorised a lift
in the selling price of tobacco. The scrip
has since advanced to 545. 9d., at which
figure the return is 3.3 p.c. on
a 9 p.c. div. basis. The £960,158 (up
£11,243) of profit was written after allow-
ing an extra £28,938 for depreciation
(£106,670) and whatever was considered
necessary for taxation and other con-
tingencies. It covered pref. requirements
and 9 p.c. on the £9,371,933 ord. capital,
compared with 8.9, 9, 7.5, 9.3, 9.2, 10.3
and 10 p.c. back to 1939. The div., which
dropped from 10 p.c. in 1940 to 9 p.c. in
1941, has remained steady for the last six
years.
Until the fog which now envelopes
trade and industry clears, and the ques-
tion of the basic wage is settled and the
confusion concerning the 40-hour week
is resolved, it is difficult to say exactly
what the future trend of net earnings will
be. Obviously much will depend upon
the extent to which rising costs are
allowed to be reflected in selling prices.
Demand continues to run ahead of out-
put, and seems likely to for some time
owing to shortage of female labor. All
that can be said definitely is that
the co. is well equipped, financially and
otherwise, to earn whatever profits are
to be won from this class of business.
The big holding co. and its five main
operating subsidiaries enjoy a command-
ing position in the trade. The operating
concerns are W. D. and H. O. Wills,
British Australian Tobacco, State Tobacco
Co., Carrearas and S. T. Leigh and Co.
The last-named makes and prints the car-
tons in which the cigarettes and tobacco
manufactured by the other four are
packed. Carreras was welded into the
organisation in 1940, B.T. paying
£1,463,335 in a mixed parcel of its own
scrip for the £200,000 of Carreras ord.
capital, plus £149,459 of visible reserves.
At the parent’s present rate of distribu-
tion, scrip issued in connection with the
Carreras purchase is costing £126,053 p.a.
After deducting its o.wn pref. require-
ments, Carreras net earnings averaged
£121,192 over the last six years.
Last term there was a shrinkage of
£30,311 in Carrearas profit (£107,048).
But net earnings of the entire group were
£11,243 better, thanks to increased pro-
duction —now 31 p.c. above pre-war level,
though the public is still short of supplies.
This followed the setting up of feeder
establishments at country centres. Idle
plant was transferred from the main fac-
tories to stemmeries at Mooroopna,
Healesville and Lara (Vic.) and Morpeth
(N.S.W.), to a cigarette-making establish-
ment at Forbes (N.S.W.), and to a
cigarette-paper-making factory at Ruther-
ford (N.S.W.). The output of papers
jumped from 583 milion in July to 740
million in August last, an improvement
not noticable in the retail market. Before
decentralisation in this way becomes part
of the co.’s long-term policy, the prob-
lem of increased transport and distribu-
tion costs and a lot of other difficulties
will have to be overcome, the chairman
says. Replacement of some old machines
by new and more efficient ones also con-
tributed to the year’s better showing.
Another feature of the year’s trading
was abandonment df bulk buying of
American leaf by the Government.
Thereupon .the co. stepped in and bought
normal supplies through ordinary trade
channels.. But the price, which bad gone
up by annual steps since war began, in-
creased sharply, owing to economic de-
velopments in U.S.A. The co. hopes to

The 1945 profit was affected by in-
dustrial hold-ups, Which interrupted the
power supply and reduced output, and
by shortage of suitable labor. Last term
the co. was more fortunate in both
respects. It turns out a wide range of
leather belting and industrial leathers,
does a substantial business as power-
transmission engineers as well, and pre-
war had built up a growing export trade
with southern and eastern Asia.
The spring of £3178 in last year’s net
earnings came from revival of the export
business, not in lines manufactured by the
co., but from other merchandise handled.
It remains to be seen how long this new
class of trade will hold. In Singapore a
collapse of food and other merchandise
prices is now under way, owing to failure
of a number of “mushroom” importers.
Under price control the co.’s Australian
profits are more moderate than those in
export markets. Before the war about
three-fifths of all Australian raw hides
were treated locally. During the conflict
the lot, plus whatever could be had from
Maoriland, were handled by Australian
tanneries, which helps to explain why the
co.’s profits for the five years to close of
accounts in 1944 averaged £12,276 as
against an average of £5910 for the pre-
ceding quinquennium.
Including a research reserve of £2500
to help develop new products, last year’s
£11,631 of profit was 14.8 p.c. on capi-
tal, compared with 10.6, 15.4, 13.2, 17.5,
15.9, 10.4, 7, 8.3 and 9 p.c. back to 1937.
That leaves out of the reckoning £6OOO
dropped from somewhere into contin-
gencies reserve, and an assets revaluation
reserve of £20,999, created by writing up
the book value of “certain assets on a
basis of original cost, less depreciation
allowed by the tax commissioner.” The
div. was lifted from 10 p.c. to \l\ p.c.,
of which 5 p.c, was labelled bonus, be-
cause of the doubtful nature of last term’s
export business.
Of the assets revaluation reserve
is to be used in a one-for-four
bonus share issue as soon as the Treasury
approves. That will lift paid capital to
£99,073, on which a 12£ p.c. div. will call
for £12,384. Whether future earnings
will be sufficient to warrant maintenance
of that rate remains to be seen. Much
will depend upon the volume of export
business, in which there is still room for
expansion in the co.’s own manufactured
lines. On the other hand, substantial
rises in costs, following introduction of
a 40-hour week and final adjustment of
the basic wage, are in prospect, and it is
doubtful whether much relief, if any, need
be expected from co. taxation.
Here are balance-sheet figures;

Cash, etc 5,584 10,683 1,560 6,656
The growth of £20,559 in the book value
of fixed assets is connected with the re-
valuation already referred to. To carry
an extra £11,951 of stocks and add
£22,459 to debtors’ balances the board
went outside for an extra £25,862. The
more or less liquid surplus (£51,053) was
£9151 less than at the previous balance.
Last officially reported sale of the
pound shares was at 275. 3d. in March,
1946. Recently buyers at 325. failed to
attract sellers. After exercising the rights
to the pending bonus-scrip issue the re-
turn at 325. would be 7.7 p.c. on a 10
p.c. div. basis.

This offishoot of Peters American
Delicacy Co, (Sydney) operates through-
out Victoria and Tasmania. Formed in
1929, it made a disappointing start, but
with the lopping of £82,825 (Bs. in the
£) °ff capital in 1932 the accounts were
put on an even keel, and, following erec-
tion of a new factory at Richmond and
extension of the business to Tasmania,
the co, soon developed into a satisfactory
dividend payer.
Distributions began in 1933 with 6 p.c.,
since when the business has stepped along
in the traditional manner of its Sydney
founder, which owns a £20,540 paid-up
share interest and is option-holder at par
of 30,000 shares if more are issued. The
div. had climbed to 9 p.c. in 1938, and
remained fairly steady, with satisfactory
margins, until last term, when a 3 px.
bonus carried the total distribution to
12 p.c.
Meanwhile, shareholders were twice
asked for more capital, and liberal
allowances for. depreciation have kept
earning assets in good trim. War appears
to have brought the co. a number of
new permanent customers, and “taking
the long view”—also no doubt with an
eye to short-run difficulties connected
with cream supplies—the co. bought the
Trafalgar milk and butter factory (Vic.).
Last term restrictions on manufacture
were modified, permitting increased sup-
plies to customers. So, although the

“Towerite”: Development at Billy
Clark’s Butler Block, Charters Towers
field (Q.), is at a standstill at the
moment. The near-by Back Jack
mine, also floated through Billy’s efforts,
has an enviable record. The new
Butler Block mine is still at the explora-
tory stage, with funds just about ample
for a proposed crosscut under the upper
part of the old workings. The Mines
Department suggests equipping the 500-
feet shaft with ladders. This would eat
up cash necessary for the crosscut or any
other development work. The shaft is
equipped with a hoisting plant and has
a second hoist powered by compressed
air from the Black Jack as a standby.
Queensland Mining Acts regulations
appear to exempt shafts equipped
with machinery, other than whim,
whip or windlass, for raising or
lowering persons from being provided
with ladderways, but wide powers are
given the department. Safety is every-
thing, yet one wonders what contingency
is contemplated that would leave a ladder-
wa> intact and yet put two separate hoist-
ing units out of action.

cision followed abandonment of an ex-
tensive hunt for oil in Maoriland by
the N.Z. Petroleum Co. (paid capital
£960,000), which had been granted special
prospecting licences over large areas in
the Dominion. Through arrangements
made with Shale Oil Investigations the
Taranaki Co. had the right to receive an
over-riding royalty from oil won by the
Petroleum Co. A continuous flow of
petroleum was proved on properties near
New Plymouth, but it was too small to
be of commercial value.

To avoid closing down the old Mt.

the Federal Government has approved
a grant of £21,800 for development work.
First worked in 1873, the mine is the
oldest, and for many years was the
largest, tin producer in Australia. Dur-
ing the war it was rented (£1352 p.a.) by
the Federal Government and worked at
a substantial loss. Recent reports sug-
gest that there are reasonable prospects
of pay-ore being located, and a diamond-
drilling programme is to be carried out
by the Bureau of Mineral Resources.

SUNDRY SHOWS
FOXES AND FURS.
Skirting by David Jones’, Sydney, a
Sundry Showman was suddenly engulfed
by a stream of excited females and
carried more or less forcibly to the lift
and then ejected into the firm’s art gal-
lery. The cause of the stampede, it trans-
pired, was not an exhibition of painting,
sculpture or other art, but a display of
£50,000-worth of furs hung on racks and
draped around the walls of the gallery.
Between such times as mannequins
paraded in pelts in a manner suggesting
they had a stronger and more natural
claim to them than the animals them-
selves, it was possible to wander through
the gallery inspecting anything from silver
fox and Broadtail lamb to musquash and
Russian Kolinsky, The perfection of the
furs, luxurious enough to satisfy the most
sybaritic taste, indicated how far the skin
business has come since Attila sported
his coat of ratskins, yet, according to the
portable Britannica, “the inception of fur
farming is lost in the mists of antiquity”
—the Chinese practised it, as they seem
to have practised everything, for an
unknown number of centuries.
Further references to the pocket
authority—made between inspection of
the furs which were examined between
inspection of D.J.’s mannequins—revealed
that, ancient as the trade may be, “silver
fox farming developed in the modern
sense from the practice of a few Canadian
trappers of keeping silver foxes, caught
out of season and consequently with in-
ferior coats, until the fur became what
is known as ‘prime.’ ” The game was
carried on more or less under the lap
until at a London Fur Auction in 1900,
a single farmed skin sold for £5BO. That
let the cat —or the fox—out of the bag
and expansion really started ; so much so,
in fact, that in 1911 all available silver
foxes were sold alive. In 1910 one pair
sold for $3OOO and figures as high as
$20,000 and even $35,000 were reached
by 1913. Against such prices D.J.’s re-
quest for £49 10s. for a single silver fox
skin seems comparatively modest.
Lest it be thought, however, from the
profusion of furs on exhibition, that fox
farming is simply the business of raising
Reynard, leaving him a few leftovers from
the family table and then depriving him
of his overcoat, it should be recorded
that the animals require kennels set in
pens 35ft. by 25ft., 10ft. high, set six
feet apart and made of 14-guage wire of
2in. mesh. The fastidious fur-bearer is
by no means satisfied with that —he is
“extraordinarily shy” and needs se-
clusion :
The farm should be kept as quiet and
secluded as possible; anything that tends
to irritate the animals, strange faces, for
instance, should be rigorously excluded and
no farmer should allow strangers in or
about the farm between January and June.
And, if sitting in a sentry box at the
gate of his farm between January and
June with a sawn-off shotgun ready to
blast the daylights out of anything that
looks like a strange face isn’t enough
to drive the fox farmer to raising white
mice or silkworms, he can then chew his
finger nails to pieces worrying about the
summer diet for his irritable, fastidious
charges—4| ounces of lean meat or offal
(133 calories), 2f ounces dry weight of
cooked cereals (266 calories) and i pint
of milk (132 calories). When winter
comes the poor fellow has to find and
measure out 6 i ounces of fat meat or
offal (267 calories), ly ounces of fox
biscuits (133 calories) and | pint of milk
(132 calories). After which it’s a miracle
that he doesn’t consign his foxes, calories,
scales and adding machine to the scrap-
heap and take to growing goldfish or
asparagus.
So much for fox farming—if it weren’t
for the material evidence presented by
D.J.’s exhibition it would be incredible
that anyone should bother with the damn’
things. There are, however, over 2000
fox farms in Canada, as well as mink,
raccoon and other breederies, or whatever
they are. The U.S.A. farms mink, skunk,
musquash, beaver, deer and blue and
silver fox and England runs to skunk,
pine marten and mole farms’—“the
ground is not cultivated in any way but
a highly luqrative crop of moles is annu-
ally gathered.” Australia, too, figures
in the picture —according to Britannica:
Most ok. the red fox skins on the market
come from Australia, where European foxes
were introduced years ago to check the
rabbit plague..
Which remark seems to be in the same
vein as another by the same authority
on the legendary cunning of Reynard;
The means they adopt to rid themselves
of fleas is a case in point. Taking in his
mouth a tuft of wool or a piece of wood,
a fox will slowly sink himself, tail first,
into a pond and thus gradually drive the
fleas forward until their last refuge is the
wool or wood on the surface of the water.
The fox then sets this adrift teeming with
the parasites and, keeping clear of it, lands
on the bank and makes off.
Still, however cunning Reynard may
be in ridding himself of stickfast, there’s
ample evidence in D.J.’s gallery that he
isn’t shrewd enough to hang onto his
pelt—although there must be something
more than shrewdness, animal or human,
that produces a “pearl platina fox” cape
worth, apparently, £499 and, unfortu-
nately, eight coupons. Other animals
seem to be in the same boat. A reach-
me-down in Persian lamb runs out at
£39, but the same thing in Broadtail lamb
leaps to £lB9. Mink dyed watermole,
whichever animal it is, enjoys a price of
£239 10s., and Canadian-dyed-squirrel is,
according to the price tag, worth £345. A
musquash coat at £205 is possibly more
reasonable but has the disadvantage of
costing eight coupons—a Russian Kolin-
sky (price £469) is obviously a better pro-
position at only five coupons.
But, whether it’s a question of coupon
or cash, there seems to be no lack of
interest in the display, and Taronga Zoo
Park will probably need extra guards
over its foxes and other fur-bearers this
winter. And D.J.’s cat, at present wear-
ing a very worried frown and hugging
its own pelt closer to itself than usual,
if possible, looks as though it might
migrate to hotter parts at any moment.
" T annhauser."
“F.S.”; The best place to hear the
A.B.C.’s platform presentations of an
opera series at the Assembly Hall in Mel-
bourne was the foyer. This is no reflec-
tion on the performers. Inside the hall
the listener had to make an abstraction,
not only from previous performances of
opera on the grand scale with scenery,
etc., but from the soloists sitting in a long
row in boiled shirts and evening dresses,
and the orchestra sitting behind them
with the chorus standing immobile in a
corner, and all gazing at the microphone
as if thfey expected it to bite them.
It was more difficult with “Tannhauser”
than with “Don Giovanni,” because
Wagner had an inveterate desire to marry
the two arts of music and the drama and
occasionally almost succeeded, though
more often he was merely comic. The
magnificent symphonic music of “Tann-
hauser” was adequately rendered by the
orchestra under Joseph Post’s direction,
but the choruses were restricted by the
size of the platform. What was best
about the performance was the magni-
ficent singing of William Herbert as the
knight who seeks solace with Venus on
the Horselburg only to be dogged by a
guilty conscience.
In the person of Rita Miller the
goddess seemed to be suffering from an
overdose of mountaineering. A relaxed
throat caused that fine singer Thea
Phillips to give up the contest for the
soul of “Tannhauser” after the second
act and Sylvia Fisher replaced her. Max-
well Cohen sang convincingly as
Wolfram.
* * * *
William Herbert sang his swan song to
Melbourne at the Town Hall the other
evening before departing overseas, and
his audience heard his almost flawless
tenor for possibly the last time. He was
equally sensitive and expressive in all his
numbers, from Bach and Handel to
Italian opera ; and a delicious panel by
Schubert was as fine a display of artistry
as has been heard for a long time. Herbert
will leave a big gap in Melbourne music.
No local singer has sung so consistently
and so often, and none has gone abroad
with a reputation as high as he has. There
was a quality in Bach’s “Haste, Ye Shep-
herds” which puts him in the world class.

“Sister Kenny”
“Sister Kenny” (Sydney Century) does
not deal out lavish entertainment. It pur-
ports to be a flat biography telling the
age-old story of the pedants who declare:
“It is new, therefore it is wrong.” Of
the arguments presented or implied by
the film tRe following comment by Dr.
Philip M. Stimson in “Life” is interest-
ing:—
Because “Sister Kenny” is the skilfully
portrayed and emotionally-told story of a
personality in whom one cannot help being
interested, millions of people will be stirred
by the movie and believe all its implications.
Three non-medical people who saw the
movie with me feel certain that laymen
are bound to get the following impres-
sions ; (1) that all acute cases of polio-
myelitis treated by Sister Kenny recover
completely and rapidly; (2) that she can
enable seven out of ten children wearing
orthopedic appliances to cast aside all such
braces, even after many crippled years, and
walk without them; (3) that, if treated by
orthopedists, “88 out of every 100” patients
will always be crippled; (4) that all but a
few orthopedists are opposed to Sister
Kenny and have nothing to do with her
treatment; (5) that Sister Kenny believes
there is no such thing as paralysis but only
“spasm, alienation and inco-ordination” of
muscles.
Most doctors studying poliomyelitis now
believe that paralysis, spasm, alienation and
inco-ordination all are causes of the dys-
function in poliomyelitis. I am told that
Sister Kenny now believes that some paraly-
sis can exist. In the same fashion most
orthopedists recognise, with her, the neces-
sity of making the most of whatever
muscles may remain free from complete
paralysis.
Film audiences should know that the best
present-day treatment of poliomyelitis in-
volves the services of many experts who
can provide highly specialised pediatric
and nursing care; then physical therapy,
in which Sister Kenny’s methods are widely
accepted as the best; then occupational
therapy, psychological help, orthopedic
support and reconstructions and, finally,
training for a self-sufficient life outside an
institution.
Pros and cons apart, the film is well
made. Rosalind Russell in the title-role
gives an excellent performance with a
worthy supporting cast. The technical ad-
vice for the Australian scenes was also
good; our customs and types were as
natural as the gum-trees, the wind-pump
and the Queensland railway station which
R.K.O. produced for the occasion from
its obviously colossal prop-room.
Artbursts.
Evidently the baleful influences of
modernism haven’t reached the Shivery
Isles, judging by the oil paintings of Will
Shuttlewood at the Kozminsky Galleries,
Melbourne. Looking at them the
observer is suffused with a nostalgic feel-
ing, for Mr. Shuttlewood does not iperely
antedate the moderns but all the schools
that have arisen since Victorian days, and
goes on his way untroubled by any isms.
Nevertheless, there is a quiet charm
about some of his pictures and a sensitive-
ness to the various aspects of Nature
which only appears to be oldfashioned.
“A Day on the Beach” gives the effect
of white-afternoonishness very nicely.

SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
It was very much a case of “After you,
Madame,” at Flemington on Saturday, with
Amelia becoming one of the few fillies who
have won the St. Leger, Flight dishing the
redoubtable Attley to become Australasia s
greatest stake-winning mare, and the three-year-
old filly Gay Queen taking the Newmarket.
In the biggest and most open Newmarket
field for many years Gay Queen had strong
support at 12 to 1. Equal favorites Kind Link
and Glenfem were at sevens, with Victory Lad
next at tens. Carrying 7.10, Gay Queen was
drawn No. 15, fair in the middle of the 33
starters, but she got going smartly enough
for Badger to ease her gradually over to the
rails. Gay Queen was up behind Rcpeno
with two furlongs to go, and, boring through
on the rails over the last bit, just pegged Repeno
in a photo, finish, with Four Freedoms next;
last year Four Freedoms and Reperio were in
the places behind Bernborough. In sixth place,
Native Son finished best of the half dozen
Sydney representatives, whose ability the Mel-
bourne handicapper appeared rather to over-
estimate.
Standing only a fraction over 14.2, pony-
size Gay Queen is a thi,ec-year-old chestnut
filly and aptly named, being by High Title
from Gay Memories. Her time, 1.151, was
the slowest for 40 years, but the track had
taken an inch or so of rain in the morning.
Over her pet distance of 10 furlongs in the
wi.a. Essendon, Stakes, and revelling in the
heavy going, Flight decisively beat Attley. There
was only a half-length in it at the finish, but
Attley, after chasing the mare ail the way,
had had enough. First prize of £lOOO brought
Flight’s total winnings to £30,202, some £5OO-
- ahead of Tranquil Star. The Essendon
Stakes seemed to indicate that, while Attley
might prove a worthy opponent for Shannon
at up to a mile, beyond that distance it would
be all Shannon. The anticipated meetings of
the two in Sydney during the autumn have,
however, fallen through.
The early stages of the St. were
reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland “ ‘Will
you walk a little faster?’ said a whiting to a
snail. ‘There’s a porpoise close behind us
and he’s treading on my tail.’ ” Bray Law, in
the role of early pacemaker, took more than
1.13 for the first five furlongs. Badger allowed
Amelia to move up with the leader at the
10-furlongs, and six from home the filly drew
clear and was not thereafter headed, though
Star Act, more or less on sufferance, was
close up at times, and finished second, ahead
of Skyrocks, with Bray Law the only other
runner. Connections may wisely decide to
give the Australian Cup a miss with the Mani-
toba filly, who has done her share of racing
this season.
Not so successful were the three fillies who
tackled four colts in the Sires’ Produce Stakes
—they were the last three home. One of them,
Jalna, was in front for a while, to lead into
the straight, but at the finish it was Chanak
(A. Breasley), with four lengths to the outsider
Cronides, three lengths to Sovereign and a
neck to Dhotrium. Chanak is bred to show
out in the best of company, being a son of
Hellespont and a grand racing mare, Studio.
Over the St. Leger distance of a mile and
three-quarters, the Flemington Handicap went
to Ellipsis, giving H. Badger his third winner
on the day. Most of the way it was a pro-
cession of 14 horses led .by Flash of Fire set-
ting a more honest pace than was done in the
St. Leger. Flash of Fire had a four-lengths
advantage turning into the straight and hung
on to land third money behind Codocil.
In other events at Flemington Helicon (J.
Purtell), a warm favorite, proved the best of
a big field of two-year-olds, accounting for
Talon and Verey Light; and in the Pines
Hurdle Spawater (R. Elder), justified the
optimism of those who accept odds of 10 to 9
about jumpers by leading all the way to beat
Ruthless, Kookaburra and the rest.
* * =f *
Air Flare, who’s been knocking at the gate
ever since arriving in Sydney with good stay-
ing credentials from W.A., broke the drought
by winning Saturday’s Canterbury Cup of 11
furlongs. Showing a return to form, Buzz Off
tried to lead all the way and, collared by Air
Flare (F. Williams) and Courier in the final
50 yards, was beaten by only a half-head and
a head in a photo, finish. State Governor
General Northcott presented the trophy.
A really good performance was turned in
by the grey Hiraji (T. Mullane) in downing
Brazier and Scotch Gift in the Flying. Hiraji
seems the best yet seen here of the progeny
of Nizami. With Gold Taj and others of
the breed at present racing here, he was bred
in N.Z., but Nizami i? now standing at F. W.
Hughes’s Kooba Stud. There should be plenty
of greys about when locally-bred Nizamis start
appearing here. Of his 18 representatives
offered at the N.Z. yearling sales 10 were greys.
Surprisingly, in view of the open fields and
the fact that the whole course was a bog, with
solid rain continuing throughout the afternoon,
well-backed runners won all eight events at
Canterbury. Daughters of Talking took both
divisions of the Maiden Two-year-old, Recite
“ Boy, what a shoot!"
(E. Fordyce) downing Million and Mulga Bill,
while Talcara (V. Faggotter) was top good for
Stamen and Torri. The times for these six-
furlongs affairs —1.19 and 1.21 —indicated the
state of the track.
Also run in two divisions, the Encourage saw
Cape Neddick (H. McCloud) confirm recent
promise by downing Bourke and Duke Havilah,
while in the second division McKechnie (G.
Weate) had an easy win from Mt. Howitt and
Rifle. Miss Corrogin (G. Podmore) may to
some extent have owed her victory in the
Maiden Stakes to Fordyce taking things a
little too easily when out in front inside the
distance on the runner-up Beau Brummell;
it brought a censure from tjje stewards. High
Tide (W. Fellows), Fast Flash and Pennicuik
filled the places in the Welter.

A much better field than usual is contesting
this year’s Australian Cup, which probably
accounts for Russia being comparatively
leniently treated with 9.12. With that weight
he should win it. Logical had been well
fancied but could hardly be considered after
his running last to Ellipsis on Saturday.
Codicil, beaten only a half-head by Ellipsis
and meeting that horse on slightly better terms
in the Cup, may be one of the hardest for
Russia to beat. Cherie Marie and Mi §s
each with 7.13, are entitled to some respect,
as is Flash of Fire with 7.8 and possibly
Haxton with 7.4. So for the Cup: Russia,
1; Codicil, 2; Miss Prim, 3.

Passed on in Melbourne at 53, Ken Bracken,
one of the best Sydney riders of his day. The
once-in-aflifetime association with a champion
galloper often lifts a good jockey to the peak
of his career; in Bracken’s case it was Poitrel,
on whom he won the 1920 Melbourne Cup and
nine other races.

The Fifth Test:— .
Though there had been rain on and off for
a couple of days, the wicket surface was hard
enough on Friday for Yardley (captain in
place of Hammond) to send England in to
bat after winning the toss. The yellow patch
had a deceiving polished glaze; it was soon
evident that there was plenty of “life” in it.
England’s start was disastrous —Washbrook,
playing too late at the fifth ball from Lind-
wall, clean bowled for nil. Hutton and Edrich,
however, added 150 for the second wicket in
three hours, before Edrich flicked at a rising
ball and Tallon took a neat catch. Bulky
left-hander Fishlock was never comfortable,
and after getting more than his issue of knocks
and bruises, was out bowled McCool for 11;
Compton had tfie bad luck to walk over the
wicket when 17; Yardley was out tor 2; and
,Ikin clean-bowled b'y Lindwall for 0. Hutton,
who took strike at 12 o’clock, was still there
at 6 p.m. with Evans (6 not out); Hutton had
hatted gamely, though luckily, for 122 out of
England’s total of 237 for six wickets.
Lindwall bowled 15 overs for 46 runs and
five wickets —his best Test effort to date.
Hutton’s 122 not out was his first Test cen-
tury in Australia. He has fine defence and
bags of patience, and it is not hard to visualise
his stay of 13 hours 20 minutes at Lords in
1938 in a world’s record score of 364. Few
more enthusiastic tributes have happened at
Sydney ground than when the three-figure tally
appeared against his name.
Rain washed it all out on Saturday, and it
was England all out on Monday at lunch, with
the total 280, and with Barnes and Morris
going strong.
What promised a rattling finish between
M.C.C. and N.S.W. in Sydney was washed
out when the match was looking decidedly
interesting. In a spirit of optimism N.S.W.
captain Lush “closed,” and M.C.C., allowed
240 minutes to make 339 runs, had 205 on
the board in 135 minutes, with 105 minutes
left to get 134. Then the rams came.
Queensland’s win in the Sheffield Shield match
at Brisbane by seven wickets was the
Northerners’ second defeat of S.A. this season,
their only successes. Final scopes; Q., 335
and 3 for 103; S.A., 224 and 213. Carrigan
made 63 and 54 not out for Q. (highest score
in both innings); it lifted his firshclass figures
for the season to 507, averaging 50.7.
* * * *
John Treloar “won” both the New
Zealand 100 and 220 yards title events
at Auckland —first to the tape, but, of
course, only a native-born runner can
hold the titles. Treloar will be officially
credited with his times. In the 100yds.
he set a new record of 9fsec., and in the
220 he equalled the record standing at
21fsec.
* * * ♦
A Davis Cup team of four has been
chosen, with C. R. Cowling, who refereed
the Cup Tie at Kooyong, going along as
manager. Bromwich and Pails were
obvious first choices; Colin Long was
picked as the most improved of local
players, and Geoff Brown in the hope
. that he may reproduce the form
he showed at Wimbledon last year, Sid-
well will also be going. He missed
selection for the Cup team, but is
to be sent over by the sporting-goods firm
which employs him. The L.T.A.A., after
changing its mind a couple of times, has
also decided to send Mrs. Nancye Bolton
to Wimbledon. Members of the U.S.
Davis Cup team held that Mrs. Bolton
would haye to be included in the four
best players anywhere, and that their
champion, Mrs. Betz, was the only one
likely to beat her.
* * * *
Hanging up the gloves at 41, British
and Empire featherweight champion Nel
Tarleton, as an amateur and a pro.,
has been slinging leather for 26 years,
starting out at a church club in
Liverpool, where they breed ’em tough.
As an amateur he won the Northern
Counties championship from 1921 to 1924.
Turning pro., he won the fedder title
from Johnny Cuthbert in 1931, and still
holds it. Altogether he fought for the
title 11 times, most recently and success-
fully against A 1 Phillips in 1945. He had
two cracks at the world title, and, with-
out winning, gave Freddie Miller about
the toughest opposition that American
had struck. Recently another world title
bout had been arranged, with the Ameri-
can Willie Pep, but—fortunately, so many
claim, for the older man —Pep broke a
leg in training. Tarleton’s best record
was having won outright two Lonsdale
Belts, which means he won each of them
three times in succession.
* * * *
Les Fuller (9.8|) was a hot favorite to
trounce Jackie Wilson .(9.8) at Leichhardt,
but Wilson’s better boxing made it very
even, and ref. Art Mawson summed it
up fairly as a draw. Fuller lost all of
round five for landing a low left and
round six for refusing to break clean.
He had to fight flat out over the last
three rounds to cut square,
* * * *
It wasn’t a clash of champions, but
the scrap between Leo Berry (9.61) and
Jimmy Macdonald (9.8) at Melbourne
Stadium on Saturday night was miles
ahead of most that cost much more coin
to witness. Fighting fiercely all the way,
they were both hard at it still at the
final bell, though neither would have liked
facing up to another quarter-round. Ref,
Jennings plumped for Berry on points.

Shares, Taxes and Other Things
On the Stock Exchange, the place
where share prices are made, the invest-
ment barometer was set fair and rising
last month. All groups—banks and insur-
ance, pastoral, retail stores, industrials,
silver-lead, copper and tin-strengthened.
A u * ui
A number of factors was responsible:
buoyant national income, especially from
wool and other exports with a conse-
quent broadening of the credit super-
structure and contmued easy money con-
dihons; another partial turn of the cheap
money screw by the Federal-Treasurer;
the flush state of Federal revenue; pro-
posed tax cuts ; strength of demand and
contmued lag in production, and there-
fore ready market for output of essential
goods; and increase m co. earnings as
disclosed by balance sheets now coming
forward and, m some cases, lifts in
dividend rates.
There is nothing at the moment to
suggest ap early and sharp recession in
share prices or business activity gener-
ally. Still, the position is not one in which
the investor can buy with his eyes shut.
The average yield over a range of 30
selected industrials is only 3.5 p.c., or
quarter of one per cent, more than is
to he had from long-dated Government
stock. This suggests that in most cases
the market has liberally discounted an-
ticipated future benefits, either by way
of increased dividends, new share issues
or gifts of bonus scrip. One of the prin-
cipai pillars underpinning the share-price
structure at the moment is the volume of
money awaitmg more profitable employ-
ment than on deposit with the banks.
To get the outlook and its strong and
weak points into perspective, it needs to
be remembered that deferred needs are
likely to be overtaken faster in non-dur-
able than in durable and capital goods,
Retailing is a field in which early prob-
ems are likely to arise. During the war,
w hen the choice was to take or go with-
public bought what was offered.

As for proposed tax cut M chif|
has now decided t 0 do what ’ Mr Menzie ’
and Mr , Fadden proposed six months
ago . The raisi & exem tion level
on personal income t 0 £3OO v d y {
ranging from 50 p c to a me e 5 on
olher inco mes, will re-transfer some
£ 33 ,000,000 of spending power from the
Government to the pockets of the people,
At the same time reductions in sales tax
amounting to more than £8,000,000 ought
to mean lower retail selling prices But
these alluring benefits promise to be
shortlived. They are political and social-
istic rather than economic in concept,
The gains will soon be swallowed by
increased costs, which will express them-
selves in higher prices for everything, in-
eluding rail and tram travel; this owing
to the 40-hour week (the case against it
at the moment is overwhelming), lift in
the basic wage (an interim 7s. a week
with the final adjustment to come) and
rising cost of imports (the impact has
no t yet been fully felt), all aggravated
by needless dislocations and interruptions
brought about by a fractious and unco-
operative labor force,
Only the naive believe that with shorter
hours and more pay labor will behave as
though there were nothing more to strike
about. The longer the wage-cost-price
spiral lasts the greater is the danger that
the next rise will destroy the balance of
the structure. The soundest way to re-
lieve pressure on living costs is to increase
production, improve efficiency, reduce
unit costs and pass on the saving in lower
selling prices in which everybody would
share. To achieve maximum production
promotion of technological progress and
"Only a shillun, Miss, an' a coupler mice with every trap”
efficiency must be a central part of policy.
The present high rate of co. taxation,
from which no relief is proposed, defeats
attainment of this objective by putting in-
centive in a strait-jacket.
“T.C.A.”: Britain is drawing on her
loan of £938 million from the U.S.A.
faster than was expected when Congress
approved the loan last year. Latest esti-
mate is that the loan is disappearing at
100 million dollars a month. It was in-
tended that both the United States loan
and the smaller loan of £2Bl million from
Canada would run for five years, but if
present expenditure is maintained the
total will be gone within three years.
Two unexpected developments account
for the speed at which Britain’s dollar
resources are dwindling the record
height which wheat prices have reached
in the U.S.A., and the rise in dollar
•
prices by 30 to 40 p.c. since the loan
was ratified.
Of monthly expenditure 47 p.c. was
for tobacco, while six million dollars a
month went for royalties on American
films. Oil, foodstuffs and raw materials
accounted for the remainder.
The main concern in London is that
dollar earnings from exports are not
counter-balancing the expenditure to the
extent that was hoped for. High Ameri-
can tariffs are hindering the import of
the British exports which would find the
readiest market in U.S.A. woollens,
worsteds and finished textiles.
Australia is vitally interested in this
rapid exhaustion of the American loan,
and every effort should be made here to
restrict unnecessary imports, particularly
luxury motor cars and Hollywood films.
The ethical value of many of the latter
is open to question, anyway.

“Mack”: Large-scale development of
Blair Athol Coal resources and the build-
ing of a rail link from the field to
Mackay, on the coast, 180 miles away,
should mean much to the northern State.
Carrying one of the thickest seams of
clean coal in the world, estimated to
contain from 400 million to 500 million
tons' with one to two parts of over-
burden, the deposit is capable of supply-
ing the whole of Queensland’s coal needs,
with a surplus for export, either to other
States or abroad. Proposed expansion of
mining and smelting operations at Mt.
Isa is contingent upon an assured supply
of coal. The people of Mackay believe
that Blair Athol and the building of the
proposed railway are the answer to Isa’s
expansion as well as to further develop-
ment of the north. The line would also
open up much valuable timber country,
assist the cattle industry and induce
settlement which would open up miles
of first-class agricultural and dairying
land. The project calls for Federal and
State Government co-operation.

Overseas Corporation (Aust.), Ltd.,
formed a little over a year ago, was con-
verted from a private to a public co. in
November last, when the public took up
140,000 new £1 ords., making subscribed
capital £200,000. The co.’s main objec-
tive is “improving the efficiency of in-
dustry in Australia and giving freer access
to the reservoirs of technical knowledge
available in Great Britain, the U.S.A. and
other countries.” It has a strong board,
and is financially interested in cos.
engaged in engineering (including house-
hold supplies and hardware), cotton
textile manufacture, aircraft materials and
parts; it has acquired world rights to
the “Aqua Lux” automatic glass-washing
machine, Australian rights to the “textile
rubberised wool process, and has been
appointed sole agent in Australia for the
Bristol Aeroplane Co., Ltd., and A. V.
Roe and Co., Ltd., manufacturers of air-
craft in Britain. After unofficial sales
at 305., the price of the scrip dropped to
255., then strengthened to 285., around
which figure it has remained steady. If
the promoters’ hopes are realised, and
given time to develop its varied interests,
the premium may prove reasonable,
though until tangible results are shown
fluctuations in price can be expected.

BEFORE YOU
//
DON'T rush into the moulding trade on your own. It takes
more than a few presses and a full order-book to succeed.
Even a combination of brains, capital and hard work may not
suffice.
Modem techniques call for experience, elaborate machinery,
a specialised sales organisation.
Established firms in the moulding industry have hundreds
of moulds ready for use as soon as materials are available. They
have the first claim on compositions which are now scarce, and
it is difficult for a beginner to compete with thqpe advantages.
In spite of these facts, many newcomers consult us about
installing moulding units. Because we are eager to help them,
to save them from disappointment and loss, we believe it best
to state our opinion at the outset . . . namely, that, while there is
plenty of room in the Plastics industry, the moulding trade is at
present overcrowded.

Experiment in De-control
The United States removal last year of
controls over all prices except those of
sugar and rice (rent controls retained)
must interest the people of every country,
prices and production being the great
social and political problems of the pre-
sent day. Predominantly a free-enterprise
democracy until Roosevelt altered things
with his New Deal “controls,” the United
States is still basically so, though it has
yet to escape completely from the en-
tanglement of war-time regulations and
restrictions.
The abandonment of price-control by
President Truman was an act of reluc-
tance; the effectiveness of the effort to
restrain price-inflation had previously
beeft curtailed by Congressional interfer-
ence with the scope and power of the
regulations, and the final act of abandon-
ment was probably one of despair as
much as anything. The country has been
industrially distraught for half a year at
least, and business and financial confi-
dence has been seriously shaken. Repub-
lican success at the Congressional elec-
tions imposed a further burden on Mr.
Truman.
American politics are never the most
stable or reasonable. It was forecast in
the United States soon after the end of
the war with Japan that by the close of
1946 production of most essential articles
(including motor cars) would be past the
pre-war rate. But in the 18 months that
have elapsed since the signing of the
surrender in Tokyo Bay vast changes
have swept through the‘economy. There
was a great clamor to get rid of taxes by
some, of wage-pegging by many trade-
unions, and of price-control by some
manufacturing interests, the latter often
being supporters of the Republican party,
but sometimes in the Democratic camp.
Conflicting interests have riven the in-
dustrial world, political factions under-
mined price- and wage-control early in
1946, blackmarkets have flourished, and,
after a prolonged boom, the Stock Ex-
change had a succession of collapses.
Industrial achievement has been no-
where near the expectations of late
1945. The automobile industry in par-
ticular has failed to attain the production
of which it seemed capable, bogged
down as it has been by industrial
troubles.
Those who asked for a removal of
wage-control have not been so keen on
the removal of price-pegging, and vice
versa. But there was a feeling, becoming
generally stronger, that with neither con-
trol fully effective it would be better to
let supply and demand, in respect of
both labor and goods, govern wages and
prices. Abruptly and in no planned way,
this has now largely come about. It is
unlikely that it has happened the best way.
But the rest of the world, itself preoccu-
pied with similar problems, should soon
get a demonstration of what happens
when a country supercharged with credit
created in war-time lets free competition
resolve wage and price levels. Up till now
it has been widely claimed that Govern-
ment controls over prices have been., cum-
bersome,. unsympathetic to producers with
claims for rising costs, and have pre-
vented or discouraged industry from
making its fullest efforts. It is probably
a pity that the authorities did not earlier
grant a more ready allowance for in-
creasing costs, thus preserving the politi-
cal life of price-control for possibly 12
months longer, gradually tapering-off the
restriction and at the same time en-
couraging production and restraining in-
flatiqn for at least that extra time.
It has long been the contention here
that price administrators should be doing
(heir utmost to work themselves out of a
job by encouraging production with a
minimum of price inflation. The same
policy would have no doubt been the
best for the United States, even if it
meant the progressive lifting of the prices
ceiling. Rigidity brought revolt; and
abrupt abandonment of all price-controls
mstead has meant the sudden throwing-
out of balance of incomes and prices,
goods being still in such short supply
that people with wg.r-time savings will be
able to outbid others not so fortunate.
Hardship and uncertainty are bound to
be widely evident among all the other
results to be seen now that the prices lid
has been lifted. The main result to be
hoped for is a strong stimulus to in-
dustrial production. The greatest fear is
mflation with production still inadequate.
One U.S. commentator, looking at the
lack of smoothness in the flow of raw
materials to industry, at the bottlenecks
and the stoppages, remarked that there
were widespread disturbance and appre-
hension that people were not-pulling well
enough together to get the U.S. produc-
tive organisation working at full capacity
and keep it going that way. Employers
paying the highest wages in history were
ess concerned about these costs than
they were about the willingness of Labor
to do a good day’s work. A record-
preaking industrial employment failed to
produce a corresponding output, judged
by pre-war standards. People turned in
creasingly to the Federal Government to
solve their problems instead of really
trying to work out their own salvation.
Alongside this industrial frustration there
existed a money-supply two and a half
times as great as before the war, giving
many a false feeling of independence,
especially with prices controlled.
The inflation danger, it may* as well be
summed-up again, arises from an excess
of money created during the war when
civilian production was far below the
volume of civilian and service pay less
taxes. The danger has been aggravated
in the post-war period by the refusal of
wage-earners to do their utmost to re-
store production and by the increase in
wages despite the lower output. It is
generally conceded, in the United States
especially, that all the requisites for a
vastly greater industrial output exist pro-
vided the labor factor is willing and co-
operative.
Competent authorities in the United
States fear that, while organised (or
trade-union) labor may now be able to
wrestle with uncontrolled prices success-
fully, those people living on fixed in-
comes will suffer badly. One opinion is:
“The unbalance now most to be feared is
that created by the rise in wages of
organised labor aboye what its produc-
tivity would support. The effect is to
raise industrial costs and prices above the
buying-power of less-favored groups.
When organised labor, which represents
but one-fourth of the working popula-
tion, puts a price on its services which
places its product belond the reach of
the purchasers it is pricing itself out of
the market This is but another way of
saying that correction of an unbalanced
wage-cost-price situation may require re-
cession or depression if it is not made
through increasing productivity,”
The answer to the inflation and pro-
duction problem has been summarised
tbtts by the National City Bank of New
York:
Instead of relying upon work and co-operation
to improve economic conditions, people have
turned increasingly to the Federal Government,
but Government efforts to help have been in
many cases not only abortive but harmful
In the effort to cushion unemployment the
Government put subsidies on not working.
The feeling has gained ground that these
difficulties are basic, and that a sound and last-
ing prosperity is unattainable until somehow
these conditions change and all groups of the
population accept the truism that economic
progress is achieved only through work and
co-operation.
If the heart of the outlook is in labor costs
and productivity, as so many believe, the en-
couraging aspect is that it is within the power
of people to improve the situation. Output per
man-hour of the industries which have been
struggling through the reconversion period will
be expected to gain if the flow of parts and
materials can b'e speeded up by attacks on the
bottlenecks, and there is some evidence that
it is on the rise now. Over and above that,
the prospect depends upon the individual will
to work and upon co-operation to maintain
stability. If all put emphasis on production.
and price their work, their goods and services
with more concern for the general long-run
welfare than for all they can get out of the
situation at the moment, the missing element
necessary for a long prosperity will be restored.
There is a maxim that “hard times make hard
work.” Some people are amending this to
read that “only hard times make hard work,”
and predicting depression accordingly. The
objective of all should be to prove them
wrong.
Removal of price-control, said by the
bank to create frequent bottlenecks that
suppress production, was unfortunately
followed by a coal strike that threw re-
conversion back several months. The ex-
periment in de-control is off to a bad
start; but there may be many profitable
lessops to be learned by Australia never-
theless. An excess of controls, subsidies
and taxes in the Commonwealth is mak-
ing a hotbed for Communist treachery.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Old-timer”: The river had broken
into the pump pit at Tapalin and, when
the waters receded, it fell to our lot to
clean out the 20 tons or so of silt and
blue clay that buried the pump. The
stuff was as gooey as boarding-house por-
ridge and, as We filled the buckets and
sent them up to Bill per windlass, he
filled the sunlit air of the billabong with
profanity as he wrestled to empty each
bucket. Then the boss got a brainwave
and we fed water into the muck until we
got a consistepcy that allowed it to slif>
easily out of the bucket. Bill stopped
swearing and the work went on. When
we climbed out that night Bill was rather
wistfully eyeing irregular rows of cylin-
drical-shaped clay heaps. “Playin’ sand-
castles?” sneered the boss. “No,” said
Bill, mildly, “thinkin’ o’ the last time I
was in Balranald an’ the lumps the
mossies raised on me.”
$ * * *
“Mat’s Mate”: The five of us on the
road job out of Lang Lang had been
there long enough to know each other,
and one night in the camp the talk turned
upon girls and which type made the best
wife. Mat would listen to a eulogy of
this type or that, and then proceed to
demolish it, a fact which annoyed Jim.
“You’re just a ruddy nark,” he snapped.
“We all know how you are about girls,
yet you try t’ tell us. Cripes, whadda you
know about ’em? Y’ never go near a
girl.” “That’s all right,” said the big fel-
low. “I know enough about ’em t’ keep
away from ’em, don’t I?” Then we
started talking about football.

“Pallamallawa”: Agree with “Sub-
Druid” (B. 26/2/’47) about the “sombre
monotony” of a pine forest but, in
justice to the pines, there are compensa-
tions in the aromatic atmosphere, the soft
carpet of needles and the somewhat im-
pressive air of peace under the trees.
There are no such compensations in brig-
alow scrub, within whose fastnesses the
wanderer quickly becomes oppressed by
the leering silence, the implacable hos-
tility of the trees and a growing sense of
being watched by waiting enemies. A
child of the bush, and therefore its lover,
I’ve always hated brigalow and can well
understand its deep and rather injurious
effect on Henry Lawson —he almost
always described the bush as desolate and
awful. A perfect description of brigalow,
but not true of the bush in general.
* * * *
“Zake”; Aqyway, how does one pro-
nounce and spell the name of that small
scrub wallaby whose chief claim to
celebrity is that he defies the usual tech-
nique of the Macropus family to which
he belongs by keeping his forepaws apart
when leaping? Webster’s International
Dictionary refers to Thetidis as a ’“paddy-
melon,” and is apparently confused with
the small vine fruit of that name. An
old Chambers’ Twentieth Century that I
have gives it as “Pademelon, a brush
kangaroo or whollabee”; a later edition
of the same work alters it to “wallaby,”
adding the alternatives “padymelon” and
“paddymelon.” <1 have also seen it spelt
“pademellon” and “paddymellon.” The
A ustralian Encyclopaedia favors plain
“pademelon.” Are the alternatives all
wrong? And whence came the name?

“Esk D.”: It is the night of the
Crutchers’ Ball at Crook Damper. It is
warm- and sultry inside the corrugated-
iron building and the raucous whisperings
of old Mrs. Croake are pregnant with
scandal. The pianist, of lean, sad coun-
tenance, runs through a series of introduc-
tory chords with feeling appropriate to
the large splinter in the middle digit of his
right hand. The noise ceases abruptly
and the M.C. beckons for silence in the
hall. “Se-lect y’r partners f’r the shot-
eess!” he bellows. The piano gets away
“They’re off!”

Joe ain > t here with the news.” “Yairs,”
drawls another . “ We c ’d hardly git on

truck are seen approaching and there is
a surge forward to greet him. “How’s
t he fire?” a dozen eager voices shout,
“ Fire? ” says Joe. “Aw, cripes, I f’rgot
t’ ask. But Grogan let us have two nines
f’r t’night.” Twenty minutes later the
dance Q f the season is in full swing,

“B. A. Ker”: There are several aspects
of electric shock still being overlooked
by the Council. One is bulk; a horse is
more susceptible to electric shock than
a man because its bigger bulk of flesh,
bone and blood offers greater resistance
to the current and is struck the harder
as the irresistible force surges through,
For the,same reason a skinny, wiry chap
can take more electricity than a strapping,
sturdy giant, when both men are organi-
cally sound. Then, too, the contact can
make a difference ; an electrician once
gave me a practical demonstration of the
f a ‘ct. , First making sure that he was
standing on dry wood (the floor was of
concrete) he placed thumb and forefinger
on terminals carrying the 240 volts of
house lighting. Without sign of distress
he explained while still taking the charge:
“By placing thumb and finger on the
terminals I’m completing the circuit; the
current is only going up my arm then
down again ; the juice doesn’t quite
reach to my shoulder. But if I put both
hands on the terminals, or one hand
while standing on a conductor, the cur-
rent would pass right through me—and
that could give my wife the widow’s
pension.” He it was who taught me
never to touch a wire for the first time
with the palm of the hand—always the
back. If anybody doesn’t know why, he
has never held a shocking coil in the palm
of the hand and tried to release his grip
as his best cobbers steadily apply the
torturous current.

“No. 1 Bench”': That timber inspector
who hung his watch at one end of a
“plugged” log while he listened at the
other (B. 29/1/’47) went to unnecessary
trouble. The oldest part of any log is
its centre, which is just why it decays.
If such an ancient was plugged with the
trunk of a young tree the difference
between the two timbers would be appa-
rent to even the most unpractised eye.
Not only that, but there would be the
matter of shrinkage ; old wood shrinks
much less than young wood, it having
much less sap in it. Inside a few weeks
it would be loose. Or, again, if to
counter this the deceiver ns6d a seasoned
plug, he would be a poor inspector who
couldn’t instantly detect the difference
between it and the surrounding green
timber of the old tree.

“Hanko”: The boss rested on the
auger and gazed down the road. “Here
comes Bill Budge on that new mare of
his,” he said. All I could see was a
wavering dot in a smudge of dust, but 1
wasn’t going to be shortsighted. “And
look at the lousy bridle he’s using,” I
said. “Just strung together with binder-
twine.” “Yair,” the trump agreed. “I
wouldn’t like to ride a strange norse in a
thing like that.” Choom’s eyes were
peering and squinting and watering.
“Looks like her near hind shoe is loose,”
I kept on. The boss visored his eyes
with a horny palm. “Cripes, yes,” he
said. “There’s only one nail hpldin’ it.”
Choom cupped a hand behind an ear.
“Aye,” he said. “Hark to click-click
of shoe on road, an’ all.” At that, we
got back to fencing again. Then a bloke
plugged past on a pushbike.

“Gravelsnatcher”: Fish bait (B.
5/2/’47)? In my youth the only reliable
inducement on the Swan River was blood-
worm, a particularly slimy specimen of
the tribe that inhabited the most nauseous
mud banks. As kids we made money
providing bait for fishermen who boggled
at the abhorrent task. The catch lay in
the fact that the worms resided in nofh-
ing less than four feet of water, and the
digger immersed head and shoulders for
each shovelful and tried not to remember
that Perth’s sewerage system emptied into
the river just around the bend. I re-
member the unholy glee with which we
watched a miserly fisherman, who de-
dared our price too high. He dug,
doggedly, and drew the wrigglers from the
stinking mud for an hour before he
climbed up the bank with a jam-tin full.
Then reaction, or something,' set in, he
became violently ill, threw the tin in the
river, and went home. The next day
we had another customer.
“C.E.’*: For some years the old sheep-
men Dale and Gome had been breeding
into a better line of stock. Each season
they imported an expert to do their
culling, keeping only big-framed ewes,
and buying high-priced rams, till their
flocks became an even line that drew
admiration from all sides. “Cripes,
wouldn’t y’ think old Sam ’d take more
interest in his stock?” remarked Dale
one day, glancing contemptuously across
the property of a neighbor. “Plods on
there with a breed o’ mongs that ain’t
a patch on the real stuff. No brains, old
Sam. Sort o’ bloke that’ll never get any-
where.” A couple of years later Dale
called in on old Sam as the latter shut
the gate on his yarded sheep. “C-cripes,
Sam, what a beaut mob,” he gasped,
staring over the flock. “Why, it took me
eight years t’ work into a line like that,
Where on earth did y’ get ’em ever?”
“Them?” drawled Sam. “Aw, cripes, I
jus’ waited till you an Corrie ’d finished
importin’ champeens, then I bought up
y’r surplus ewes a coupla years an’ kep’
their prog’ny.”

“Betcha”: We were trailing a mob of
jumbucks when Ted’s rabbiter put up a
young hare, coursed it across the flat and
eventually picked it up. Then, thirsty
after the chase, the tyke trotted down to
the creek, selected a deep pool and de-
posited his catch in the water alongside
him while he drank. Three times during
his refresher he stopped to retrieve the
hare on the water’s edge and dump it
again in the depths. Then, collecting
the dripping bundle, he fell into place in
file dust cloud behind the jummies. An
hour later I drew Ted’s attention to the
mong as we neared his yards. “Yair,”
he nodded. “Snitch carries ’em for miles.
I’ve tried all ways t’ make him kill ’em
or bring ’em to me, but it ain’t no use.
See them,” he pointed to half-a-dozen
bunnies disappearing under the chaff
house. “All his,” he explained. “Brings
’em home an’ after a bit just leaves ’em
somewhere. He’s a pretty smart rabbiter,
Snitch,” he added proudly, “ah’ nob’dy
c’n say he don’t catch ’em, ’cos there’s
dozens he’s caught livin’ under the wool-
shed,”

“Simon”: I don’t think the word
“dunnage” (B. 12/2/’47) is derived from
that George Dunnage who was a would-
be settler on the Swan River in 1829. In
my old American dictionary dunnage is
stated to be “faggots, boughs or loose
wood laid on the bottom of a ship to
raise heavy goods above the bottom to
prevent injury from water; also loose
articles of lading wedged between parts
of the cargo to hold them steady.” In
the British Empire Dictionary practically
the same meaning is given, with “sailor’s
baggage” added. As the impedimenta of
George Dunnage bore little resemblance
to the above, my guess is that the word
had its original habitat a long way from
Australia.

“Wippegong”; For regularity in nest-
ing routine, mutton-birds must be hard
to beat. Roa'ming about the
Pacific for the winter, they head
south in time for Bass Strait
observers to plant spring crops
and check calendars by their
arrival. Burrows are dug and/or
cleaned out and eggs laid to
the day—imagine a great cen-
trally-controlled incubator with
branches around and across the
Strait and you have it. Once
brooding begins the foraging
mates leave together before
dawn, and you may take your
seat amongst the marram-grass
tussocks to watch their return
as the early stars blink.
Five minutes after the first bird skims in,
the air is black with them. Strong wings
cut close to your hat, but the only sound
is from the wings. It’s when the food-
laden Wanderers begin to flop beside the
burrows that the clamor begins. Hunger
brings the nesting birds up the burrows,
thousands of husbands take an ear-bash-
ing before they’ve a chance to explain,
then, in desperation, they ram their beaks
into the magging maws before them and
regurgitate the day’s takings. The mass
debate, however, reaches its peak as they
syphon soup into each other, with the
added gurgling effect now putting the
last horrible touch on what already was
a hideous discord—may the Anditws
sisters never hear it! Returned the other
night to an old colony after a break of
ten years or so. The first bird appeared
up the same little inlet at the same time,
and was followed after the same short
interval by the same eerie black swann.
The burrows were still thickest where I’d
known them so before, and in the same
patch of bracken I repeated the act of
treading on a bird —possibly the same
bird. The agonised squawk and the
savage snap from the hooked beak were
both familiar.

“Yagoo”: Quartpot races still add a
bit of' excitement to the dinner camp
in the cattle country (B. 12/2/47), and
occasionally you’ll hear an old - timer
proudly claim to have “the fastest boiling
quart in Queensland.” Tobacco is still the
stake, though the round tins of cigar-
ettes so popular before the war have
vaAished. I had a beautiful little black
quart with which I won many a pound of
weed, but it was finally downed in an
exciting race at Imbaka Lake. I set my
champion up against four other good
quarts and an old fruit-tin owned by a
young half-caste ’Ghan. It was like see-
ing a field of thoroughbreds beaten by a
raw-boned brumby ; the fruit-tin romped
home. The tobacco was paid over, but
there was a scramble to get it back
when it was discovered that the lad had
somehow managed to slip a couple of
small pebbles into each of our quarts.
WAITING FOR THE MAIL.
Three times a week the mail-car, across the
Comes rattling with our letters, our papers and
—our bills.
The village lights assembled,
Their eagerness dissembled,
Won’t know until they’re sorted what dis-
appointments, thrills,
In those sealed bags await them
To please or irritate them, .
To elevate their spirits or aggravate their ills.
They crowd the office counter —an agent’s note
for Joe
(The hairy rabbit-trapper) with cheque from
So and So!
Joe grins, and in his pocket
Crams envelope and docket,
Departing in a hurry. The others rightly know
That Joe, unkempt and leery,
Benevolent and beery,
Has gone to greet the barman and bid the
liquor flow.
Fred Fielding pushes forward; he grabs a
slender mail;
His features, fat and florid, revert from red
to pale—
“ For three-pun-ten and under!”
He shouts in tones of thunder,
“They’ve sold them pigs in Melbun! Too late
to cancel sale!
I’ll wire the wicked robbers
That me an’ all me cobbers
Will send our stuff to Sdndy, the whole of it,
for sale!”
Old Mother Jones approaches, she wheezes and
she moans,
Rheumatics nip and grind hen she creaks in
all her bones.
But now her face hard-bitten
In cheerful smirks is litten —
A bottle of the Cure-All may even cure Ma
Jones.
By parcel post arriving
It points to her surviving
The cold of coming winter with mild and
mellow groans.
Miss Sally Smith trips lightly two awkward
youths between;
She has no brains whatever, but, turning
seventeen,
The males declare her pretty
As flash girls from the city;
At all the district dances she holds her own
I ween.
And this, the last mail order,
Will make her, round the Border,
Despite the jealous females an undisputed
queen.
At last I breast the counter, my fortune I
rehearse:
Two bill?, a seedsman’s pamphlet, and some
rejected verse!
Avaunt this inky scrapping,
I’m going rabbit-trapping!

A partnership I’ll wangle;
Surveyed from any angle
No other occupation than writing could be

“Tummas McNark”: Sometime in the
immediate past a gentleman found him-
self holidaying at Tuggerah Lakes, an
attractive spot some 60-odd miles from
Sydney, a large town south of Newcastle,
in N. S. Wales. This chap discovered,
among other things, the succulent prawn
and the energetic prawn-fishers of the
Lakes, whereupon he composed an article
which was duly printed in the Sydney
“Morning Herald.” After describing the
prawn and the fishers thereof, the article
concludes:
Sometimes the nets bring in good-sized
fish, but more often the catch includes
such unwelcome additions as electric eels,
fortescue or conger eels.
The electricity carried in the electric or
“numb” eel is so strong that a shock can
be felt by touching the net in which it is
caught. The pain from the sting of the
small fortescue is almost unbearable and,
strangely enough, never abates (despite the
most drastic treatment) until the tide turns.
The really dangerous fellow, however,
is the big conger eel, sometimes almost as
big round as a man’s waist.
Payne related how one night in the dark-
ness he pulled a conger eel into his boat
with him.
“There wasn’t enough room for both
of us,” he said, “so I got out and left
him to it!”
Apart from suggesting that the chap who
thus discovered the prawners was quickly
discovered by them, this rather puts out
of joint the noses of the Grafton polar
bear, the Junee reindeer, the Lake
Dynevor bunyip and the Tantanoola
tiger. As some modern wit has remarked,
“They’re very funny fishes, eels —very
funny,”

“Bad Australian”; “I’m ridin’ past the
widder O’Brien’s place,” said the cook’s
offsider, “w’en she calls out ‘Get down
offa yT horse an’ cummere.’ I gets orf
an’ goes over t’ w’ere she’s standin’ along-
side of a big ’oiler gum an’ there’s a
goanna with a belly like a poisoned pup
layin’ at her feet. T caught fills plunderin'
devil at las’,’ she says, ‘it’s ’im that’s been
eatin’ me eggs an’ chicks this six months.
He was makin’ a queer clinkin’ sorta
sound in his inside as he was runnin’ an’
I want y’ to try an’ find out what ailed
him.’ I takes out me knife an’ slits his
gizzard an’ out rolls half-a-dozen o’ them
china eggs wot’s used f’r kiddin’ Jjens t’
lay. Seems he’s bin takin’ them in same
as the reel eggs, but as ’e can’t digest ’em
they keeps pilin’ up in his stummick an’
makes ’im so slow the widder’s able to
catch up with ’im with her woodener.
Well, she takes them eggs an’ shoves ’em
inter a biskit-tin on ’er kitchen shelf.
About a week or ten days later she hears
a kinda scratchin’ an’ scrabblin’ in the
tin, an’ w’en she lifts the lid damned if
it ain’t ’alf full o’ baby goanners.”

“D.R.H.”: Caught in a summer thun-
derstorm near Adelaide I was almost
deafened by a noise which came, not
from above but from below the ground.
In one spot where there were only a
few inches of sand over hardened gravel,
the row, when one bent over and listened,
was intense. To revenge my ringing
ears I got a digging fork and scooped up
the offending chunk of S.A. In wet sand
was a most formidable-looking animal
with whiskers fore and aft, a violin and
bow on his back and a pair of shovels
and a pair of pruning hooks up forward.
This •agricultural musician has since
travelled north several hundred miles in
a soak’s paradise—a jar of alcohol —and
I’ve just finished dissecting him. For all
his bristling jaws and digging apparatus
he’s a perfectly harmless citizen: a mole
cricket, a subterranean cousin of the
familiar house cricket. He has the usual
musical equipment of the cricket family:
on each wing a scraper, the violin bow —
\fyhich he rasps across a perfect file, the
strings—that has evolved from a wing-rib.
His down - sloping head and powerful
chest give him a mole-like appearance.
But his front legs are the masterpiece of
adaptation. The. joint of each has
“Do something, quick — l'm getting
seasick !”
been flattened into a powerful shovel, or
perhaps fork —there are four “tines” —
while the fifth joint, hinged to and
rotating on the “shovel,” is a roughly
semi-circular shearing blade with prongs
for holding any obstreperous rootlet that
needs pruning.

“G. 8.”; The carcasses of birds which
“B. A. Ker” (B. 12/2/’47) found on his
beach were those of the short-tailed
petrel or mutton-bird. When the breed-
ing season is completed on Bass Strait
islands these birds ip countless thousands
begin their long migration to Alaska and
Japan, gathering their food —shrimp-like
crustaceans mostly—from the face of the
waters. Unfortunately, at some periods
by some freak of Nature, these crusta-
ceans fail to surface, and that means
starvation for huge numbers of the birds.
I have seen the beach between Port
Stephens and Newcastle strewn with their
dead bodies, which in all cases bad been
reduced to skin and bone.
* * * *
“K.R.”: Browsing in a book of Ken-
dall’s poetry I was puzzled when I several
times met the word “sooming.” There
is “a still lagoon hard by the sooming
sea.” To emphasise the difference be-
tween sea and lagoon he adds that “the
pool was always mild” even “when waves
were wild.” The violence of the sea is
clear in these lines;
By this surging sea,
By this surging, sooming sea,
By this wailing, wild-faced sea.
But in “The Wail of the Native Oak”
Kendall writes of “those hollow, hopeless
tones, Sooming round the swooning
silence,” and Then asks “What might
mean that muffled sobbing?” Coupled be-
fore with “surging” it is now joined with
“swooning” and “muffled.” Is there
such a word, or did Kendall create it for
alliterative aid and poetical fancy? I
have never met it before, nor is it in any
dictionary,
« * * *
“Blime”; As an amateur angler whose
enthusiasm waxes and wanes with the
state of the larder the vagaries of trout
intrigued me, and I began hunting the
reason why they go off and on the bite.
Plainly, hunger has nothing to do with the
happening, nor does the choice of bait,
though there are times when they show
a decided preference—as, for instance,
a white fly when the small white moths
abound over the stream. “It’s the
weather,” one old chap told me. “They’ll
always bite when it’s close and stormy.”
It cost me a thorough drenching to dis-
prove him. “No use fishing with a south
breeze,” I was informed on another
occasion, and went out into the southerly
and grassed half-a-dozen beauties. After
trying out all sorts of days, I decided
the secret is not in the weather. Nor
has the time of day anything to do with
it, for one morning the fish may bite
early, while the following one finds them
on a hunger strike. Many times I have
noted the time when trout began to bite,
checked later with other anglers a few
miles upstream, and learned that the
biting period coincided. Seems to be no
understanding fish, yet there must be a
reason somewhere.
* * * *
“Salmon Gums”; “Notaden’s” tree that
was thrice struck by lightning (B.
5/2/’47) probably had its roots in an
underground stteam, which would so
effectively earth it that it became an
ideal lightning conductor. In three suc-
cessive thunderstorms lightning destroyed
three trees on my property. Acting on
the advice of an observant oldster I sank
shafts near each, and in each case struck
water at shallow depth. Coincidence?
Maybe, But those trees all drew from
that underground stream, and is there
any really authenticated case of lightning
striking a dead tree?
* * * *
“Bo”: Those Ma State Diggers who
waited optimistically for the McKelly
gang to settle them on the land and are
still waiting for the McGirr outfit to dis-
play some slight interest, and who may
have sometimes pondered on the multi-
farious legal traps to be sidestepped be-
fore they get within cooee of eVen their
hopes, can absorb some slight compensa-
tion from the reflection that at least they
haven’t been as stiff as was one Wagga
selector whose case caused a stir at thp
i time of my youth. Hair was the success-
ful applicant among a number who had
| applied for a block of land, but a dissatis-
fied loser moved the Lor to eject him
from the block on what looked to be a
most tenuous legal point: to wit, that
Hair had posted his application to the
State Land Agent through the ordinary
post, whereas a regulation prescribed
that the application “may be sent by
registered post” Defendant’s counsel
contended that the word “may” consti-
tuted an option which his client had exer-
cised. At the appeal to the Supreme
Court their Honors held, unanimously,
and with costs, that “may” meant
“shall,” adding a severe comment on the
poor mental capacity of the regulation-
drawer-up. So that Hair had leisure to
tear his hair after doing his block for
not having spent the extra thrippence—
yes, it cost only that then —to register the
envelope. Truly, the snares along the
realty track are many.
* * * ♦
“Plum”: Can’t agree with “Kenwood”
(B. 19/2/’47). Two factors, one of which
does not exist in the emu’s stomach, were
at work in corroding those steel posts
and pipes. The first was moisture which
acts as a catalyst or “middleman,” with
traces of air, in corroding metals, pro-
ducing the oxide or hydroxide. The
other was a group of bacteria, rejoicing
in such names as crenothryx, spirophyl-
lum and cocobacillus, which play a large
part in the corrosion of iron and steel
underground. They do not themselves
eat the metal, but attack it incidentally
in the course of their life processes.
Some take in iron in solution and exude
“What about giving us ‘Sweet Adeline' again, Joe?”
it through their outer cell walls as iron
hydroxide. Others, by reducing sulphates
present in soil moisture, form sulphur-
etted hydrogen, which attacks iron. The
presence of metal among the minerals of
the soil seems to set off almost a chemical
laboratory of reactions. Coming back
to the emu apples—the bacteria would
scarcely be able to affect their hides,
these being presumably not steel. But
the free hydrochloric acid in the emu’s
stomach (beside which normal soil
acidity is mere soothing syrup), plus the
abrasive action of the assorted stoneware
in its gizzard, would very likely soften
the seed cases enough for water to pene-
trate and set off germination.
♦ * * ♦
“Shamuseen”: In the pre-cigarette era
the condition of a man’s pipe often de-
cided his chance of getting a job in a
droving plant. The boss gauged the
applicant’s experience from the size of
the burns on the side of the smoke piece.
Deep burns indicated long experience at
lighting the pipe with a coal from-the
fire. The gauge was fairly accurate, as
the seasoned droving hand, on rolling out
of his blankets to take his turn at watch,
was wont to pick up a live coal for his
pipe, rather than start a rush by the
sudden flash of a match. Sometimes
impostors crept in, as a result of a trade
in coal-charred pipes, which were some-
times sold to newchum job-seekers,
* * * *
“Solitude”: The new bloke didn’t know
Seventyfiver. He started on dampers. “It
ain’t everybody can make a good dam-
per,” he said expansively. “Them little
ones are easy enough,” indicating the
cart-wheel specimen from which Seventy-
fiver was blowing the ashes, “but I used
t’ make ’em three times as big. Ever try
your hand at a decent one?” “Yair,
once I did,” admitted the old bloke.
“When I wus learnin’. Kept addin’ water
an’ flour, then more water ’n’ more flour,
t’ get ’er right. When I come to the end o’
the bag I shoved ’er on the coals t’ cook
all night,” “Turn out eatable?” “Wa-al,
the winder bein’ blocked out nex’
mornin’,” explained Seventyfiver, “I
didn’t know it was daylight an’ she got
cooked a bit solid on the outside. Not
that it mattered. We cut a ’ole in the
side an’ jus’ hacked out a bit o’ the centre
till she was done. Then we give ’er a
coat of oil, an’ she was jake.” “Oil?”
puzzled the other. “What for?” “ ’Gainst
the weather, ‘o’ course.” Seventyfiver
stopped to eye the new-chum quizzically.
“Wa-al now,” he drawled, “don’t tell me
y’ ain’t ever noticed that big store shed
we got up be’ind the yards.”
* * * *
“S. Post”; Jack the boss drover had
taken a nasty toss from a bad horse. We
listened to his tale sympathetically. “I
was all right till he started them high,
jerky roots, landin’ on one leg,” he told
us; “then I reached for his mane an’
hung on like hell. Next thing I knows I’m
on the ground and I got me fist wrapped
around a bunch of Mitchell grass! ”
* * * *
“Horseless Horseman”: “Bad Aus-
tralian” is right (B. 5/2/’47). The platy-
pus is found in practically every stream
from Cape York Peninsula down, though
99 per cent, of visitors to the lonely river-
side spots would never know of the
animal’s presence there unless they fluked
on one. To see the duckbill you have to
lie still on an overhanging bough for a
while around sunset before his dark form
appears and frisks about below the sur-
face. At the slightest movement he is
gone. In from Cooktown before the war,
I bathed every night for nearly two years
in a river, and, because I read in some
treatise that platypuses were found only
in southern latitudes, I never thought of
them until a bloke I knew rode up one
night and offered to sell me 1200 skins!
His illicit market had fallen through and
he had had the parcel of skins for two
years without being able to unload them.
But from the observations I learnt from
that fellow I’ve been able to recognise
signs of platypuses in almost every stream
I’ve set foot on since in the Common-
wealth —including the Lower Yarra.
LACTEAL LAY.
The milk you drink in cities is the watery milk
of cows
That graze in placid paddocks, in sunny pas-
tures drowse;
And all the clover blossom where the droning
brown bees hum
Is distilled into a fluid that needs a dash of
rum.
The milk we drink, my hearties, is drawn from
stubborn flocks
That leap up stony hillsides and live on scrub
and rocks.
Compound of earth’s own fatness, a slightly
moistened cream,
It gurgles down your gullet in a smooth,
delicious stream.
Those flocks are never docile —no “lowing
sweet-breath’d kine”;
For Jeanie’s like a doormat, and Bonny’s just
a swine;
True, Bid is an exception: she’ll follow to the
door—
And eat the green linoleum from off the kitchen
floor.
Their every prospect pleases, and only man is
vile;
You’ve got to hunt them, storming, for mile
on stony mile,
Till (limping, wet and weary, with bruised and
blistered feet)
You hear .among the bushes a deprecating bleat.
They nimbly trot toward you with hopeful,
greedy eyes
To see if in your pocket you carry a surprise.
I wish I knew their secret —how from boulder,
bone or silk,
These capricornian alchemists can make such
lovely milk.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS"
Drought’s Aftermath.
“Burigaree”: Heavy summer rains
bring waves of blowflies and internal
parasites and present conditions are ex-
actly similar to those of about seven
years ago when sheep losses in north-
west N.S.W. were greater after, than
during, the drought.
Before the war manufacturers of fly
dressings and drenches imported most
of the ingredients, and from their ex-
perience of shipping delays and the inter-
mittent seasonal conditions were able to
regulate stocks to keep the market sup-
plied and to meet any demand, no matter
how heavy. During the war, however,
Government departments took control —
with little knowledge and lots of assur-
ance. Manufacturers were told what
they might carry, what they might import
and what they might charge. Some re-
strictions have been lifted but others re-
main.
Within a month of the rain sheep will
begin to show signs of worm infestation.
Worm drenches, irrespective of the name
they are sold under, are based on a
limited number of active constituents,
mainly phenothiazine, carbon tetra-
chloride, nicotine sulphate, bluestone and
arsenic. All, with the exception of nico-
tine, are produced in Australia today.
Unfortunately, production has been at a
standstill since employees at the sole
source of supply went on strike last
October. Most of the strikers have long
since found other work, so that even
when the strike ends it will be some time
before production is possible.
Briefly, the position is: phenothiazine,
no supplies available, retail stocks finished
weeks ago ; carbon tetrachloride, no sup-
plies, only small retail stocks totally in-
sufficient to meet the coming demand;
nicotine, none available, importation for
drenching purposes has not been permit-
ted for past two years; bluestone, small
supplies; arsenic, in short supply, no
soda available to dissolve it for drench-
ing purposes.
Realising the danger, manufacturers
have tried vainly for months to obtain
import licences in order to maintain sup-
plies of much-needed drenches. Millions
of sheep were lost in the recent drought.
Millions of the survivors face certain
death from internal parasites. The blame
can be placed on a handful of agitators
and on a Government that has allowed
the strike to be prolonged for months
and has persistently refused import
licenses for chemicals without which the
sheep industry cannot function.
N.T. Stock Wastage.
“Outback”: Though there is an acute
shortage of beef in Queensland, fat stock
are wasting on N.T. properties owing to
lack of transport, according to A. L.
Rose, Chief Veterinary Officer of the
Territory. One property alone had 900
prime bullocks, but the owner was un-
able to get them to market in good con-
dition and kept them. By the end of
1947 all major N.T, stock routes will have
water at least every 20 miles, but at pre-
sent* there are several long stages with-
“Yair, puttin' a fence up at last—Mums always complainin' she's
got no privacy."
out water. But even on well-watered
routes it is not desirable to shift fat
stock such a long distance by road to
get them into Queensland.
Before they can be moved by motor-
lorry steps to prevent the spread of the
cattle tick and cattle diseases have to be
taken. Sealed road surfaces from north
to south and to the east from Tennant
Creek to Mt. Isa constructed during the
war provide opportunities for the trans-
port of cattle by motor transport, and a
number of diesel transporters, capable of
moving up to 60 head in two trailers, are
now transporting stock from 450 miles
north of Alice Springs to the railhead.
With the tick- and cattle disease-control
problem settled, it should be possible for
these motor vehicles to operate into
Queensland, provided the Queensland
Government does not attempt to tax them
off the route. ,
With assured transport to market of
fat stock, cattle-owners in the Territory
would have more inducement to improve
their herds by the introduction of good
bulls and to improve their properties by
providing water subdividing pad-
docks. At present it is only big com-
panies that can undertake herd improve-
ment and subdivision. Rose visualises
the development of two or three main
killing centres with quick dispatch by air
of carcasses to the main consumption
centres. The Royal Commission which
inquired into abattoirs and meatworks in
Queensland did not favor the establish-
ment of inland killing centres, but most
practical cattlemen disagree with that
finding.
N.T. Wheat.
“New Englander”: The Northern
Territory is in many respects similar to
the wheat-producing areas of India. In
that country the wheat is planted towards
the end of the monsoonal rains, when it
germinates quickly in the warm, moist
soil. It is harvested during the warm and
dry winter. With fertile soil and reliable
monsoonal rain, the N.T. is worth a trial
as a suitable area for the growing of ex-
port wheat. There is an enormous de-
mand for flour, and success would be of
great benefit to Australia.
Boars and Sows.
“Myrrhee”: Boars and sows with an
inherited capacity for high fertility won’t
necessarily produce large litters, says L.
A. Downey, Victorian pig expert.
Environment must be right, and en-
vironment includes food. Give the boar
sufficient food to keep him in good fleshy
condition and feed the sow well enough
after weaning her litter to bring her into
good condition ; then restrict her diet to
keep her in good condition until- she
farrows. Excessive fatness is undesirable
in boar or sow.
Essential constituents *in the diet of
breeding pigs are separated milk or
buttermilk, or meat-meal, and pasture or
cut green fodder or legume hay or chaff,
together with cereal grain or meal to
make up the required bulk. The boar
may be rendered temporarily infertile by
excessive work, in which case a rest from
service for a month, accompanied by
good feeding, will bring about an im-
provement, If the boar is kept away
from sows except when required for con-
trolled service his productivity will be
fully maintained for a long period.
To Make a Waxed-end.
Materials required: ball of
hemp, cobbler’s wax, and, as you can’t
get pig’s bristles, two thin wire needles.
If you are using English hemp take nine
to 13 strands; with the Australian article
five strands will do. As you break off
the threads made the ends “puffy,” don’t
cut them or break off cleanly. To en-
sure tapering ends, after breaking off the
first, make each piece longer than
the last.
Now hold the threads together and
rub them over with wax, putting very
little on the tapering ends. Smooth and
even out the wax by rubbing over with a
piece of soft leather. To round off the
job, lay the thread across your thigh and
roll with the palm of the hand, taking
care the ends do not twist and curl.
Finally thread the tapering ends through
the needles far enough for the combined
thickness of thread, when turned back,
to equal the thickness of the needles.
Cover Crops.
“Bogan Joe”: The use of cover crops,
particularly in orchards, is essential for
maintenance of organic matter in the
soil, but many orchardists fail to make
full use of essential cover crops. Under
any system of continued cultivation it is
difficult to check loss of humus and every
effort should be made to maintain and
even increase it.
The tufning-in of green legumes like
clovers, peas, beans, vetches, does the
job. The self-seeding subterranean
clovers have proved to be possibly the
most valuable in districts to which they
are suited. In the higher-rainfall areas
sub. clover is looked upon as a soil
builder without equal. However, all
legumes are valuable as they use less
nitrogen in the soil during their growth
than other plants, and thus, as their
humus-building properties are high, are
best.
Next best are barley, oats and rape,
and following them a volunteer weed
crop can be made good use of, particu-
larly if top-dressed with super, in the
autumn. The vital feature of these cereal
and weed crops, however, is to plough
them in whilst they are young, succulent
and full of substance. Growth of cover
crops should not be disturbed until the

Dry Curing.
Rub the meat well on the
fleshy side with brown sugar, using from
lib. to 21b. according to size of carcass.
Lay the meat on a bench or any vessel
that will not retain the pickle, and cover
it with a layer of fine salt and squeeze it
on as tightly as possible. Add another
layer of meat, and salt as before ; re-
peat until the whole carcass has been
treated and leave it for a week or ten
days, by that time the salt will be nearly
all dissolved. Turn and pack again,
covering each layer with salt as at first
.and let stand for three or four weeks,
according to size of carcass; it will then
be ready to dry or smoke.
This method gives equally good results
with mutton, hams and beef for drying
or smoking. The work should be done
in autumn or winter to avoid risk of
loss, but meat can be cured in the warmest
weather by cutting up and salting while
still warm after killing. The process is
simple, rapid and effective —spread a
convenient length of wet bagging on the
bench and lay the meat on it fleshy side
up, then cover with a thick layer of salt
and place another length of wet bagging
over all. The meat will be well salted in
10 or 12 hours.
Hints for the Farm.
“West”: Lumpy jaw is caused by a
fungus which enters the tissues and forms
abscesses. It grows on grasses and
cereals and enters the animal by way of
the mouth. Treat in the following
manner before the abscess breaks: lance
(preferably with the point of a very
sharp knife just protruding through a
cork) and pack cavity with a paste of
arsenic and water to which a small
quantity of washing-soda has been added.
One application correctly done is suffi-
cient. When the abscess forms on the
tongue daily doses of \\ to 2\ drams of
iodide of potassium will sometimes effect
a cure.
“Sundowner”: Difficulties of establish-
ing crops on salt patches can be over-
come where farmyard manure or any
well-rotted organic matter is available to
cover the affected areas. Pasture plants,
such as Wimmera rye or King Island
melilot, that are resistant to salt then
do well if seed is broadcast over the areas
in the autumn, after which the surface
of the land is scratched to lightly cover
the seed. If the saline patches become
bare and are spreading, affected areas
should be ploughed deeply in the autumn,
then allowed to remain. After the heavy
winter rains have fallen they should be
seeded with a mixture of 201 b. of barley
to 21b. Wimmera rye and 41b. K.I. meli-
lot to the acre with a liberal application
of super, and be lightly cultivated.
“W. Court”: Constant wetting of
shallow cuts in the limbs of horses
doesn’t assist healing. It is advisable to
sponge away dirt from fresh cuts with an
antiseptic solution (not too strong) and
later to dust the area with antiseptic
powder. Such a powder consists of
2oz. each of alum and zinc oxide and
4oz. boracic acid well mixed together.
Applied twice daily, this powder dries up
the parts and promotes the growth of
new skin without causing pain.
“Sarina”; A neighbor swears by a
mixture of molasses and warm water for
clearing up the most stubborn cases of
skin-itch in horses. Some years ago a
very serious visitation of horse-itch on
the C.Q. coast sent horse-owners rushing
to veterinarians for advice. The neighbor
was one of the many who spent pounds
on temporary effective lotions and washes
before he hit on the molasses cure. He
recommends that molasses be used in the
proportion of one part to five or six
parts of water, but does not think a
stronger mixture would be harmful when
the itch is extremely bad.
Bill C. ; If you have too many
shallots to use on the table, don’t worry.
Allow them to remain in the ground
until the “bulbs” are of about finger-
thickness. Pulled, peeled and washed and
pickled in good vinegar, they make a
fine substitute for pickled onions, al-
though they resemble asparagus tips to
the eye.
“Johnny”: To combat red mite, which
plagues the citrus family, spray when
the buds arfe beginning to fill with one
part lime sulphur to 16 parts water. Re-
peat in December, using a half-strength
spray (one to 32). For the later treat-
ment choose a cool day.
“Prof”: Rhubarb grows best in the
kitchen garden if drums with the bottoms
knocked out are "placed over each plant.
Light is excluded from the sides forcing
the rhubarb to grow upwards, resulting
in better quality. Give each plant a
barrow-load of stable-manure once a year
and water frequently, especially during
the hot weather, being careful not to
break the sticks by forcing water into
the centre of each plant. Half-a-dozen
plants will supply a family of five
throughout the year if different varieties
are grown. The crowns can be sub-
divided every third year.
“Myrrhee”; When selecting poultry for
breeding see that the bird, male or
female, is bright and active, mature, well-
developed, of normal size and vigorous.
The eye should be full, prominent and
bright; the body of good depth, the back
long, the breastbone straight. The
female should be a proved layer of nor-
mal-shaped eggs of good size and shell
texture. Finally, select from high-pro-
ducing families,
“Gzob”: If the poultry-breeder house
is square round out the corners by nail-
ing a strip of sheet metal or board across
each corner to stop the chickens crowd-
ing there.
“Mr.”; Tests at Werribee State Farm
(Vic.) show that whole grains with mash
omitted altogether are capable of produc-
ing good results (meatmeal, however,
must be fed to balance this ration). The
grain—wheat, oats, maize or barley—is
fed either twice a day, allowing the birds
as much as they will eat at each feed, or
in hoppers where it is always available.
With either system the meatmeal is fed
in a hopper accessible at all times.
In these days of high costs a copy of
Handy Hints for the Farm, at Is. (Is. 2}d.

over 1000 tips for paddock, barn and
home, and is available from newsagents
or direct from The Bulletin, 252
George-street, Sydney.

Insignia, Quadrat, Magnet or Pinnacle
for seed? It’s wanted for experiments.

and wouldn’t hurt anyone. Didn’t think
any of them was drunk —not very drunk,
anyway.
Tom Travers said Billy Barton was his
friend. He was shocked at the fatal acci-
dent. It was hardly a fight at all with
Adolf. Just a scuffle, really. Very re-
grettable. He was to blame for it—hot
Temper. Very sorry it happened. Was
; a bit drunk at the time —not at all clear
as to what started it. Didn’t hear Billy
Barton say anything beyond “Stop it! ”
His head cleared, he said, when Billy
threw him against the stack —wouldn’t
> fight with Billy. Saw Billy along the road
jto the corner near Baker’s Gully, Best of
i friends at parting. Sang a song or two,
1 perhaps three, along the road and
through the paddock. Yes, he remem-
bered now, it was “Annie Laurie.” Had
been only once to Billy’s hut —months
ago—one wet day when they went speck-
ing along Noonan’s. Didn’t think Billy
Lad an enemy anywhere. Couldn’t
/imagine Billy taking his life or anyone
1 taking it. Only went to the corner at
Baker’s Gully that night. Best of friends
when they parted—always had been best
of friends.
Jim Bower was voluble and tearful.
The coroner was merciful to old Jim,
and heard what a fine mate Billy Barton
was and how hard Jim found it to be-
lieve that Billy was dead.
Jim declared he didn’t drink very
much—never gdt really drunk, though
he might be a “bit slewed” at times. Was
quite sure there was a big difference be-
tween “slewed” and “drunk.” He heard
distinctly what Billy Barton had said to
Travers. It was “Annie Laurie.” He
was_ sure it stopped the fight. Couldn’t
imagine why.
Saw Billy Barton and Travers going
across Schneider’s stubble paddock. Very
friendly-like. Holding each other up. No,
not drunk. Perhaps a bit slewed.
Yes, ne heard them singing (Billy had
a lovely voice). They were singing
“Logan River.” Was sure it was “Logan
River.” Everyone knows “Logan
River.” No, he couldn’t sing it himself ;
couldn’t remember the words now. But
his poor old mother used to sing it on
hot mornings when she did the washing
under the big plum-tree ...
The coroner’s jury returned a verdict of
death by mischance.
WORK was resumed at Billy Rosen’s
in a subdued tone. There was some-
thing wrong about that verdict. They all
felt that now.
They had to be careful, though, about
feeling it. Tom Travers wasn’t to be
trifled with.
For he had gone further than the
corner at Baker’s Gully that Saturday
night. Everyone knew that now. Mrs.
Reynolds had heard them go by—that
was half a mile beyond Baker’s Gully.
She had heard the shot, too —about two
o’clock in the morning, and had heard
someone walking past—in the opposite
direction about an hour later. It looked
bad. Very bad.
Funny thing, too, about “Logan
River.” Old Adolf knew something about
that. He got extra specially drunk the
night of the inquest and rolled and
staggered down to Emil Schneider’s and
told him about it. That Travers was a
dangerous fellow, and had thrown a man
into a flooded river in Queensland —the
Logan River. Billy Barton had told him.
He didn’t know how Billy had found
out —perhaps Travers had told him.
Adolf said some men are like that —can’t
keep entirely quiet about their crimes.
Adolf hoped that Travers didn’t know
that he knew. Travers was dangerous.
Tom Travers was quick enough to see
that people were afraid of him, and their
being afraid made him very frightened.
He lacked the power to hide his fear,
and that made him more dangerous still.
In all, it was a great relief to everyone
that, when the job at Billy Rosen’s was
finished, Travers went to town and then
disappeared entirely. No one ever heard
of him again.
Various Verse
The Focus.
What I see is a circle, but vaguely
bounded.
By the vast unseen and unknown ever
surrounded;
A circle, with no visible line to define it —
/ never can see that line but must divine
it.
When my eye rambles the centre is all-
pervading.
When it is fixed all else vanishes, fading
Out of the field, but a point —a person, a
bird,
A wave, a peak, some long-pedigreed
word,
Remembered elms, the cry of a wounded
hare —
All the force of the mind-stream focuses
there.
And if it’s a book, a play, a chanted
story.
Be it bespattered with mud or a blaze of
glory.
Then, in the mind, of the giver and the
receiver,
Be it saint or devil, king or coalheaver,
One figure will arrogate, by right of
position,
All to himself —the hope, the spirit, the
vision :
Charles James Fox, reading of Satan’s
wars
With the hosts angelic, clashing amidst
the stars.
In his “Paradise Lost.” and of Satan’s
ambition and sin.
Shouts aloud “By God, I hope he’ll win !”

ARNOLD WALL.
The Leaders.
I would not damn our friendship with
' my creed
Nor be accursed with yours. The
aspiration,
Edgeless and vague, with which you’d
save the nation,
Sharpens to party rather than to treed.
Another party-label clarifies
The essence of my would-be generous
aim.
You call my snobbery by its rightful
name.
As I do yours, and neither of us lies
More innocently nor more flagrantly
than when
We prate ourselves as ordinary men.
Which our indignant secret hearts deny.
We are blood-brothers, no man else
being by.
And Everyman will say of us, that he
Is all for you, and has no time for me.

Intelligence Test.
“Professor John Zachary, zoologist of Lon-
don University, will attempt to measure the
intelligence of an octopus.”
—“Daily Telegraph.”
As a scientific experiment my attempt
to measure the intelligence of a trio of
orang-utans was a signal failure. As a
form of entertainment, particularly to the
apes, it may have been a success.
Determined to observe their reactions
in an environment as near to human as
possible, I dressed them fairly convinc-
ingly in lounge suits, collars, ties, hats
and well-fitting shoes and persuaded
them, protesting energetically, to accom-
pany me on my daily occasions,
I soon formed a decided opinion of
the intelligence of my friends. What with
references to “birds of a feather” and
flippant requests to be introduced to my
family, the experiment soon lost a good
deal of its gloss. The orang-utans were
also uncooperative. They caused a
complete breakdown in our office routine,
and their habit of holding footraces oyer
the heads of the queue had a disorganis-
ing effect on my tobacco and meat sup-
plies. On hot days they would take off
and fan themselves with their trousers,
resulting in several cases of shock among
short-sighted bystanders.
Amusement, in the shape of a day at
the races, seemed to appeal to them very
little. Admittedly the day was warm,
the trams were crowded, the bar was
mobbed and we backed a lot of losers,
but the air of concentration with which
they appeared to discuss the whole busi-
"I never could use the rest!"
ness when we got home disconcerted me.
I became alarmed when they fell silent
and stood eyeing me intently.
The experiment came to a sudden end
when I realised that they were attempting
to measure my intelligence and had, in
fact, succeeded.
PLUM.
Strange Interlude.
“Moslem riots in the Punjab are regarded
seriously. At Amritsar troops were finally
called out to restore order, but only after 115
Persians had been taken to hospital.”
—Sydney “Sun.”
Some reactions to this interesting news:
M. Molotov: It is just another ex-
ample of the vicious anti-Soviet machina-
tions of the Western capitalistic Powers.
Obviously the Persians were Fascist re-
actionaries in the pay of the British and
were used to foment riots, thus giving
Imperialist England an excuse to get back
into India and once more forge the
gyves on its Indian slaves. The chief
role of the Persian Fascists, however, was
undoubtedly to poison the minds of both
Hindus and Moslems with hideous anti-
Soviet propaganda. Soviet Russia has
always viewed the gallant struggle of
Indians to free themselves of the tyrant
yoke of the British Raj with the utmost
sympathy. And the U.S.S.R. will not
lightly forget this latest example of the
perfidy of Sultaneh and his reactionaries
in Tehran.
George Bernard Shaw; I’ve been say-
ing for sixty-five years the Persians
should stick to Lydianism and lime-juice,
but unfortunately the sound advice I give
politicians is never taken. There were
115 Persians taken to hospital—well,
what of it? That was a far more sensible
thing to do than to take the hospital to
the 115 Persians, who probably would
think it was some new sort of harem, any-
way, If it is accounted desirable to per-
suade the Persians, when discharged from
hospital, to return home to their revolt-
ing cats, their magic carpets and their
pursuit of happiness by bribing each
other, then undoubtedly the most effective
method would be by putting them on the
Gandhi diet of goats’ milk and caraway
seed and forcing them to listen to a read-
ing of Rabindranath Tagore’s verses.
Clement Attlee: We’ve given the place
away, so I don’t see that it matters now
whether Hottentots or Spanish hidalgos
were present at the Amritsar disturbance.
Certainly we shouldn’t think of asking
anybody for an explanation of the un-
happy affair. Now, you’ll excuse me, but
I’m very busy, what with nationalising
the flypaper and associated industries,
trying to see what would be the most
suitable departments Shinwell and
Strachey might be willing to mess up next,
and determining which would be the best
Crown colony to make a present of to
somebody.
Dr. Evatt: That representatives of one
of the Small Nations should be exposed
to danger in this manner is a matter that
it will be imperative to raise in the
Security Council of U.N.O. at the appro-
priate time. As their acknowledged
leader, it will devolve upon Australia’s
representative—myself, of course—to de-
mand a vigorous thrashing out of this
question, and if the veto is used by any
of the Big Four we shall renew our fight
for its abolition.
A spokesman for the Waterside
Workers’ Federation: The incident is just
another example of the vicious anti-
Soviet machinations of the Western capi-
talistic Powers. Obviously the Persians
were Fascist reactionaries in the pay of
the British, and were used to foment
riots, thus giving Imperialist England an.
excuse to get back into India and once
more forge the gyves on its Indian
slaves. As a protest against this dastardly
action of the British and Persian Fascists
the council of the federation has in-
structed wharflaborers to cease work on
all British and Persian ships in Australian
ports, and has declared “black” all food
for Britain. We expect the seamen,
miners and ironworkers to come out in
sympathy with us.
Ben Chifley: I haven’t seen the news
item referred to, and I’ve had no official
notification of it. At this juncture I can
only express regret that certain elements
in certain unions have seen fit to take
certain action, and although I can’t do
anything about it, I appeal earnestly to
them not to do anything which will
weaken the movement or hinder the Gov-
ernment.
Arthur Calvell: The unfortunate
Persians are probably displaced persons,
and on humanitarian grounds they must,
on their discharge from hospital, be
given a chance to make a new life in a
new country—and what better country
than ours? I shah have priority landing
permits issued for as many of them as
are available —provided, of course, they
are all Zionists.
His Magnificence Vice-King Billy: I
have heard the name Amritsar some-
where before, I think. Wasn’t there a
horse of that name that used to race on
my Sydney Tuff Club’s courses? Now,
excuse me —I’m being fitted for a new
cocked hat with some feathers—white
ones, I think I’ll have—on it.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid
4l|d. per line; all others per line.
“Freedom from Fear”
Fear of hunger guides the plough and
builds the hafn. Fear of cold drew the
first primitive housing scheme. Fear of
enemies. bound the first communities to-
gether. Eliminate fear of want and you
will produce lotus-eaters.
The surest way to ruin any nation
would be to assure the people a living
wage without the necessity to work for
it. Takei away the fear of the sack and
you will have slackers and absentees.
Fear of the ballot-box is the only thing
that controls the elected leaders of de-
mocracy. Totalitarian rule without fear
is an impossibility. The price of peace is
that vigilance which is born of fear.
Man is not a reasonable animal. He is
driven by necessity as a member or as a
leader of the herd. Our aborigines had
a whole continent to play in. They never
had to fight anything stronger than them-
selves. They could dodge the seasons and
live on the land. They never evolved
from the Stone Age, planted a crop or
fashioned a coat of skins. They neither
toiled nor progressed.
The less we work the nearer shall we
get back to the abo’s state. In fact, we
are already on the way, many of us living
in caves, cooking in the open and going
walkabout when we should be on the job.
That way lie the wurlie and the
witchetty grub. What we need to bring
about a new and better order is some-
thing to scare the liver out of us. — Mass
Psycho (S.A.).
The Woman’s Part
We hear frequently from politicians
and union leaders of the need for
preserving “our Australian way of life,”
but the term is never explained. As a
housewife, I find that it means that
women have to do the work usually done
by coolies in some other countries.
Woman’s part in “our Australian way of
life” is the hunting for food and house-
hold necessities, queueing, carrying
heavy loads arid working the clock round
at cooking, /cleaning, washing, ironing
and the like. Domestic assistance is prac-
tically unobtainable except by the rich;
nursegirls are as rare as the dodo and
laundry facilities. outside the home are
almost non-existent.
The man’s part in “our Australian way
of life” is to do as little as possible for as
much money as possible, and to drop
even that if some fellow-unionist is dis-
missed by a courageous employer, or if
a horse’s breath meets with disapproval.
His role is then to sit in the sun and
smoke, go to the horses or dogs, fish, surf
or play cricket while the taxpayers pay
him enough to keep the domestic pot
boiling.
Being neither a politician nor a trade-
union leader, I think that the sooner “our
Australian way of life” is knocked on
the head the better. Then, perhaps, we
shall see the beginning of an era of
reasonable living for decent citizens. —
Alice (N.S.W.).
Cost of Education
How long are parents to be penalised
for educating their children to the highest
possible level? Faced with an acute
shortage of scientists, the Government is
making no effort to encourage university
education in any but the most brilliant.
Statistics show that while ten per cent,
of the population is capable of taking a
university-degree course only one per
cent. does.
For students over 18 no tax exemption
is allowed, though they may be totally
dependent on their parents for support
and education. Until recently 16 was
the age at which tax exemptions ceased.
The average university student is 18 at
the beginning of a course, the shortest of
which is three years. The cost of the least
expensive course is £lOO for books and
lecture fees, on top of which parents
have to provide board, clothes, pocket
money and the like. Science and medi-
cine are particularly expensive—a student
starting science this year at Queensland
Uni. has to pay £l4 for first-term fees
alone. ,
The Government should grant
special tax exemptions to the parents of
university students for the duration of
their course, provided no year has
to be repeated.—l. D. (Q.).
Area Schools
Jane Edwards (B. 19/2/’47) dis-
approves of “infants” spending a
whole day away from home. Children
of 11 to 15 are scarcely infants,
and the journey and education .alongside
others from neighboring districts should
broaden their outlook. Staffing of area
schools with hand-picked teachers lifts
the standard. It would benefit student-
teachers to be attached to these schools
after graduation. “J.E.” thinks atomic
developments make centralisation
dangerous. There would be no need to
drop a bomb on 200 children ; one super
bomb could wipe out the whole of Tas-
mania ! The lady praises the English
system of training boys to handle cars
and girls to run a household. Tasmania
teaches them blacksmithing, carpentry,
plumbing and domestic science in all its
phases.
“Wombat” asks “where does the mental
effort come in?” The Tasmanian sylla-
bus includes mathematics, English litera-
ture, history, civics and geography to the
post-primary standard. As for teachers
becoming agents for ration-book distribu-
tion, charity appeals and the like, these
features are common in all States, and
have no particular relationship to Tas-
manian area schools.
The Tasmanian educational authorities
propose eventually to raise the school-
leaving age to 18. Any system that will
halt the drift to the cities has great
national value by increasing primary pro-
duction and building a healthier race. —
T. W. CTas.).
Wheat Costs
Once more the chimerical cost of
wheat production is being sought by a
highly-paid body of officials at the tax-
payer’s expense—allegedly to fix a figure
as a step towards Government control of
production. In less than half an hour an
office boy could give just as reliable an
estimate by taking 100 figures ranging
from 2s. to 6s. with a few near the Bs.
mark, then striking an average as cost of
production per bushel.
Each farm in each district varies, and
each paddock on each farm can vary. I
have had a four-to-five-bags-per-acre re-
turn cost me nothing by buying lambing
ewes to eat off a “volunteer” crop and
selling the stock at an advance to pay
for harvesting. Other crops have cost me
4s. per bushel to produce—seed was dear
after previous year’s drought, horsefeed
the same, and return from crop small, —
Milton (N.S.W.).
Naval Ships
It is amusing to read in the daily press
of proposed uses for paid-off naval ships
—such as the suggestion that Mr. Calwell
grabs the obsolete cruiser Adelaide for
immigrants. It would take months to fit
her for a sea voyage and the cost to the
taxpayer can only be imagined. Refugee
Polish Jews were critical of average im-
migrant accommodation which brought
them to a better land. What of the non-
reffos who would have naval ratings’
accommodation wished upon them. Are
they to sleep in hammocks like Jack?
It was asked recently why corvettes
are not used to carry urgently-needed
timber. They have no cargo space, and
cost of propulsion would liken it to
delivery of firewood by a Rolls Royce.
Housing costs with such timber would
preclude all but reffos from having a
home.
Navy ships are built for speeds to beat
an enemy without worry over fuel bills.
Vessels intended for carriage of cargo are
slow to ensure voyaging on a sound fin-
ancial basis. A ship’s designed speed has
a direct bearing on her fuel consumption.

Compulsory Unionism
Since the unions (B. 19/2/’47) are in-
creasingly usurping the functions of gov-
ernment and have increasingly more say
in our national comfort and prosperity
(or otherwise), isn’t it logical to apply
the same compulsion to them as we do to
the electorates?
Three things are necessary: (1) Com-
pulsion of every worker to join his union,
thus bringing in those who are short-
sightedly showing their disgust of union
tactics by standing aloof; (2) protecting
those moderates against victimisation by
imposing the secret ballot; (3) making
any union ballot invalid unless 90 per
cent, of affected members vote. In short,
compulsory enrolment with compulsory
and secret voting.
One firm could offer evidence that uni-
versal unionism would work in the right
direction. After enduring inconvenience
and losses through friction between union-
ists and non-unionists, it decided to re-
commend that all join the
union. It did not compel; it encouraged.
That shop is now practically 100
per cent, unionist and the existence of
two opposed factions has been eliminated.
Further, to the gratification of the man-
agement, the moderates have ousted the
extremists from office and there is be-
tween employers and employees a spirit
of co-operation which previously was
grimly lacking.— Hist (N.S.W.).
Visual Education
“N. 8.” asks me (B. 12/2/’47) if I have
ever seen a child who was not receptive
to a movie show. I have, but that is
beside the point. My objection to films
as a medium for teaching is that they
are too quick and easy, and things can
never be learned easily.
It is the same with the art-appreciation
business which educationists are going in
for with their ears back. Children are
shown reproductions of great pictures,
told what to think about them by com-
mentators, taken on tours of galleries
where guide lecturers expound the points
of a Rembrandt or a Rodin, and in a
short time are made bored and blase
about works of art into which their
creators poured their life’s blood. No
musician would say that anyone could
learn to play the piano by listening to
concerts, and ev£ry musician of distinc-
tion has learnt his art the hard way.
There is no doubt that films would be
a quick and easy way to teach children
facts. But they won’t teach them to
think, and more thinking and less re-
membering is what is needed in modern
education.—L. I. (Vic.),
The Vicious Spiral
If anyone thinks that price rises need
not follow wage rises, consider these
figures:
The £1 rise in the basic wage de-
manded by the unions represents an in-
crease of 18.87 per cent, on a basic wage
of £5 6s. a week —the rate existing in
industry before the recent rise of 7s.
(which I am optimistically regarding as
something on account of the 20s. asked
for). Our wages bill last year amounted
to £BO,OOO. Increase that by 18 per cent,
and you have £94,400. Our net profit
for the year was roundly £19,000 ; deduct
£14,400 from that and you have £4600
left. That is less than 3 per cent, on our
capital— not as good as Mr. Chifley’s
loans and certainly not a business proposi-
tion.
Our industry is highly efficient, and re-
ductions in manufacturing costs could
only be achieved by the sacrifice of
quality, the prime factor in competitive
selling. Therefore our prices must go up.
I have dealt only with direct wages we
pay. Indirectly we pay a proportion of
those of other manufacturers who supply
us with various materials. They will be
compelled to raise their prices, and that
is a little bit more to be tacked on to
ours. The thing snowballs indefinitely,
and only the economists can tell us if
there is a solution to it.— Manufacturer
(N.S.W.).
Repat.
“A.J.M.” (B. 12/2/’47) must have
struck an unlucky set of circumstances.
In January of this year I became ill with
“You bet We're lost! THAT Wasn't there this morning."
all the symptoms of malaria, although I
had never had the wog before, and it was
16 months since I had been in a malarial
area. My wife rang the'local Repat.
doctor and he attended promptly, diag-
nosed malaria, left the appropriate doses
of quinine, atebrin, plasmoquin and took
a blood test for checking.
I was away from work for 10 days,
during which I saw the doctor again and
completed forms applying for sustenance.
Within two and a half weeks I received
the first payment, and payment for wife
and child followed within 10 days. The
amounts are tax-free, and I reckon I re-
ceived fair and swift treatment. — Archer
(N.S.W.).
My son developed foot trouble
from marching and needed an immediate
minor operation. Unable to get any
satisfaction from Repat., he went to a
local medico and had the operation done
immediately. The doc., a Digger, sug-
gested that he should send in the bill to
Repat. on the off chance of collecting
for the lad. A month after Repat. re-
ceived full particulars of the operation
the patient received a return rail warrant
to Sydney, with instructions to report at
Concord or some place and have the
operation done by Repat. He’s still wait-
ing to see whether Repat. will pay the
local d0c.—2315 (N.S.W.).
Our Glad Rags
I am shabby. After waiting five
months for a suit I have yet to be called
for a “fitting.” I could buy beach
wear and outrageously colored shirts and
sports coats which no man would be seen
wearing, but prefer to live in my barrel.
I should like a car, but no car dealer is
interested in would-be buyers without
trade-ins, and new models are beyond my
pocket.
Yet some kind of vehicle is essen-
tial in these times of not knowing from
one week'to the next whether trams and
buses will be running.
My butcher shut his shop for a fort-
night as a protest against black-
marketing of meat. Now he is open and
selling at prices considerably closer to the
black level he claimed to be combating.
Potatoes are periodically scarce and the
price of fruit and vegetables scandalous.
An evening paper’s “what you should
pay” column is the joke of the district,
as local prices are invariably much higher
than the columnist’s. One power failure
burned out my condenser in the radio,
and others repeatedly interfere with my
work. Gas bills mysteriously remain at
their usual level despite supply failures.
I still have a roof over my head and
consider myself lucky. Others are opti-
mistic about beinig housed some time in
the ’fifties. And to cap it all the N.S.W.
“Government” has just sent citizens to
the polls to vote on the momentous ques-
tion of hotel hours. — Bondi Beachcomber
(N.S.W.).
Our Tourist Attractions
The people who run our tourist pub-
licity make the sad mistake of thinking
that, because we think a thing is worth
going miles to see, the overseas visitor
will be similarly impressed.
It has been announced that a color
film of the Blue Lake at Mt. Gambier
(S.A.) is to be made and shown abroad.
It’s a poor advertisement. The surround-
ings of the lake, which occupies the
crater of an extinct volcano, are nothing
as far as scenery goes, while as for the
lake itself and its much-boomed blue
color —I’ve seen it many times and its
color was invariably that of dirty pea
soup. The average tourist from overseas
—familiar with the marvellous surround-
ings and sapphire color Off mountain
lakes in other parts of the world—would
turn a very jaundiced eye upon it.
But, we are not devoid of tourist-
bait. There are: the wildftowers of
W.A. in spring; the long reaches of the
Coorong Lakes in S.A., with their
myriads of wildfowl; our tree-ferns and
native trees, like the redgums; the
N.S.W. surf beaches —and also aboir.
1000 miles of other surf beaches, indue
ing the one, nearly 100 miles in length in
S.A.; our fruit; the scenery of the Blur
Mountains; the tropical forests c:
Queensland ; finally, something which no
other country in the world can approach
—the Barrier Reef,
Those are what we have to offer to
the tourist. We should concentrate on
selling him the goods which he has neve:
seen before and not those which he can
view at home.
One tourist who leaves us satisfied tha:
he has had his money’s worth does more
good than a thousand pounds spent on
publicity .-rH. A. L. (S.A.).


Road and Rail
“R.H.G.” (B. 18/12/’46) says that if
the law of supply and demand relegates
to the railways the job of carrying “low-
rate” traffic while “first-class” stuff tends
to go by road, we must accept the fact,
cease “strangulating” the road-haulier
and allow him to continue to “pick the
eyes out of” the available traffic until
such time as the railway fades gracefully
away. This will, he claims, boost thd*
national economy to a remarkable de-
gree. Bust seems a more appropriate
word.
Can “R.H.G.” explain what it is that
makes one article “first class” and ex-
pensive enough to be carried by road
while another is “low rate” and must
stick to the cheaper railway? Is it a
natural phenomenon working on behalf
of the motor trade, or is the division a
purely artificial business with a definite
object?
If I load ten trucks with ten tons of
ten different commodities ranging from
tea to postholes does one truck £Ost
more to haul than another? Has
“R.H.G.” considered these simple facts?
What does he propose to do with all the
“low-rate” traffic which can’t afford to go
by road when the railways are no more?
Shall we have huge subsidies replacing
the present rail “losses” or shall we aban-
don all production in which the motor
trade has no interest?
He ends on a note of urgency: “The
problem must be solved,” I agree fully.
We cannot all live by transport, but he
goes on “We cannot hold everything
back... .for the railways.” Hold what
back? The constant rise in the national
transport bill caused by the use of more
and more transport in the fa.ce of de-
clining production? The everlasting rise
in taxation which this leads to? The ever-
increasing dependence on imported sea-
borne supplies? The diversion of more
and more manpower to less-efficient
forms of transport with the consequent
decline in the productive labor force?
It’-s a pity we can’t hold these things
back. —L. I. B. (Singapore).
H. S. Seward, M.L.A., in a speech on
the transport of bulk wheat by road to
Perth from up-country, said:
Apart from the cost of bringing wheat
down by road, there is another im-
portant phase and that is the damage the
heavy trucks are doing to the bitumen
road 12-ton lorries are making big holes
in the road....they are cutting them to
pieces.
This illustrates a queer point of view
on road transport. It indicates an atti-
tude of mind towards roads which holds
that any repair work done after the mak-
ing of them is something to be deplored.
Any damage done by motor transport
has more than once been the occasion,
incredible though it might seem, for agi-
tation to have the traffic stopped —not to
have the.road strengthened.
This negative outlook is typical. No
one seems to ask what are roads for?
They are put down to stand traffic, and
if they f don’t stand it they must be re-
paired and strengthened.
Consider for a moment the organisa-
tion for keeping railways in repair. Tally
up the number of full-time gangs, with
tools, machinery, inspectors and what-
not, who are employed all over the
country in doing nothing else but repair
the “permanent” way. Do we have
members questioning all this cost and
condemning the railways because the
locos damage the tracks? On the con-
trary, this is the one and only angle
from which the railways are not attacked.
Everyone takes it for granted that the
lines must be kept in good repair regard-
less of the cost and regardless of the
damage done.
But with road transport we find that
these traffic ways are expected to miracu-
lously keep themselves in repair. With
America as a pattern staring us in the
face ; with its fleets of huge diesel trucks
thundering across the continent day and
night, with its motor-transport system a
vital and integral part of the national
economy, we persist in fumbling with our
own, problem, obsessed with the same
prejudices that had a man carrying a red
nag in front of the first automobiles. —
R. H. G. (W.A.).
An Example
As a result of a three-year campaign,
practically every form of Communist
control in Rockhampton (Q.) has been
broken up.
The most satisfying feature of the busi-
ness is that the anti-Red movement was
launched and largely carried through by
uniomsts. The Rockhampton Trades
and Labor Council, formerly dominated
by the Communist party, refused to
associate itself with the 1946 meat-strike
which Communists had organised. It
also refused to send delegates to the last
trade-union congress in Brisbane, recog-
nifns in its true light as a Communist
sideshow. All Communist candidates for
the last City Council election were re-
jected.
Speakers at Commo street meetings are
now systematically and effectively heckled
into silence. Attempts to form a Eureka
Youth League have failed completely.
Waterside troubles have practically
ceased and Red influences against sea-
borne traffic and commerce have been
kiboshed. A substantial loyal majority
of railwaymen has squelched Commu-
nistic activities in the A.R.U. branch.
Every public organisation in the city is
now united in a constructive effort to en-
sure that the Reds shall never have a
chance to regain the powers of mischief
which they formerly exercised.
Originating with a few clear-headed
and determined unionists, the Rock-
hampton movement provides an example
which might be followed in many other
places with immense advantages to all
decent workers and to Australia in
general.— Qwertyuiop (Q.).
House Values
Have Queensland house values ad-
vanced, as “Insurer” suggests (B.
15/l/’47), from 20 to 33| per cent, since
1939? They haven’t in W.A. I recently
exchanged a house for an orchard. The
sworn valuer, who spent ten minutes on
my property, arrived at a figure by asking
the purchase price—l93s, and a bargain
—deducting one per cent, per annum
since erection 20 years ago for deprecia-
tion and making meagre allowance for
improvements. Upkeep was not con-
sidered.
He was an independent valuer with
nothing to gain from a low valuation, so
"You an' y'r Tivoli act! You'll NEVER cut a scarf that way!"
presumably his method was quite accept-
able to the price-fixing commission and,
as the transaction was an exchange, with
the one valuator, I suppose it operated
fairly. But the price I accepted was far
below what I could have asked in 1939
and made me no allowance for my good
buying in 1935.
Incidentally, most property sales in
my town are exchanges with estate agents
showing a double commission. In any
case —both properties about £7O0 —the
agent collected over £6O on the trans-
action, in which no salesmanship was in-
volved. —P. C. (W.A.),
Capital Punishment
There is more to the question of capi-
tal punishment than “A.D.” allows (B.
8/1/’47). There are, as he says, murders
committed under the influence of drink
or violent emotion ; there are also murders
committed to end intolerable situations,
and there are murders with such purely
criminal motives as robbery and the sheer
love of killing. Murderers in the first two
classes are seldom executed, even where
the law allows it, but the third type is
too dangerous ever to be left at large.
The first duty of the law is not to the
killer but to his potential victims, and a
chance of “making some atonement” is
apt to be used to repeat the crime. In
this connection it is at least arguable that
death is more humane than lifelong im-
prisonment with no hope of release. It
is certainly safer. Where the victim is a
policeman on duty the issue is pven
plainer—the law sends him unarmed
against dangerous criminals, and it should
do all in its power to discourage assaults
on him.
“Labor” politicians did not flinch from
executing Japs guilty of war crimes,
though the Japs could plead that they
had been brought up to consider such
acts right and proper, and, in some cases,
had been ordered by their superiors to
perform them. Yet a thug who com-
mitted murder, rape and attempted
murder against, a young couple is con-
sidered a fit object for their pity and
clemency.— Heresone (Q.).
East and West
“Septimus Warwick” (B. 5/2/’47)
makes some strange comparisons. He
says that Western art is a science of rep-
resentation while Eastern art excels in
color, stresses rhythm and strives to de-
pict the essential spirit of things invisible
to our senses. One can’t argue about ab-
stractions, and “S.W.” gives no examples ;
but, for instance, in what way is Eastern
architecture any more rhythmical than
Rheims Cathedral, and where in Eastern
painting will he find the glorious color of
a Titian, a Velasquez or a Rembrandt?
The fact is that Eastern art is much
more simple and primitive than Western,
which is not to say that India, China and
Japan didn’t have artists as great as
Europe. But their medium was much less
complex, and they could no more ex-
press the nuances that a Titian could
put into a picture than their writers
could express the complexities of thought
of a Socrates or a Shakspeare.
But this all concerns two traditions
which have been lost more completely in
the West than in the East. Since Admiral
Perry let off his guns at Shimonoseki the
Eastern races have been steadily absorb-
ing Western culture, and in some respects
have even bettered, their instruction. I
read the other .day a manifesto of the
Premier of the new Republic of Indo-
nesia, In terms of nationalism, com-
mercialism, financialism, industrialisation,
scientism and militarism it was indis-
tinguishable from any similar manifesto
which might be put forward by any
European politician.— Feng-Shui (Vic.).
Law and Business
Of the last 40 years I spent the first
35 in and about the practice of the Law
and the remainder in commerce. I see
now that it would have been better for
me and my clients if I had had the
commercial experience first.
It is amazing how little the average
legal man knows of commercial and
banking practice and particularly of
ordinary book-keeping. Worse, he does
not seem to appreciate that his clients,
like the grocer’s customers, are entitled
to expect prompt service. In the pro-
fession one gets too accustomed to giv-
ing and receiving concessions in the way
of time for doing this and
venient for practitioners but not always
of advantage to clients.
The merchant who is careless about,
getting his accounts out and his money
in ends in financial trouble very quickly,
but far too many solicitors are lax in
this regard—admittedly some delay is
unavoidable when costs have to be taxed.
In the bigger offices a costs clerk is usually
employed and accounts are reasonably
up to date, but in smaller offices there is
far too much laxity in this important
item.
The client who embarks on litigation in
courts of higher jurisdiction where “plead-
ings” are used is invariably the victim
of a certain amount of unnecessary delay.
The object of pleadings is to narrow
down the issues before the case goes to
trial, and theoretically the Court’s and
everyone else’s time is saved. But in
practice there is tar too much dawdling
by all concerned in getting the issue*
settled and the way cleared for trial.
The judiciary could be stricter about these
delays and counsel and solicitors could,
if infused with a little commercial bustle,
bring things to a head more quickly.
I’m not implying that all members of
the profession are hopeless procrasti-
nators —many are quite the reverse. But
I do think that a term spent in a good
“live” commercial business would be in-
valuable to a young man before entering
upon a legal practice. —X. Leckes (Q.).
Wouldn’t Work Here
I came upon an economic plan which
seems sound and sensible and which could
easily be adopted as a national policy.
Here are the five points:
Promote agriculture and industries pro-
ducing consumer goods, to raise living
standards and to secure an abundance of
principal consumer goods.
Promote technical progress in all
branches of the national economy, with a
powerful increase of production and a
rise in the productivity of labor.
Raise the productivity of labor by mak-
ing the utmost use of the eight-hour work-
ing day, by the all-round mechanisation of
branches of industry which are heavy labor
consumers and by intensifying production
processes.
Enhance the significance of profits and
cost accounting as an added stimulus to
production. Increase the profits of all
branches of industry by lowering costs of
production.
Increase the proportion of premiums for
fulfilment and overfulfilment of output pro-
grammes in the total earnings of workers
and clerical employees.
I am sure this would win the suppprt
of industry generality, but the unions
would oppose the eight-hour day, and
the suggested increase of profits would
cause an explosion in some Red quarters.
The proposal for premiums on output
would create immediate strikes in 100
workshops. No, I don’t suppose it would
work here—it’s part of the recently im-
plemented five-year plan of the U.S.S.R.
—Simple Simon (N.S.W.).
Empire Federation
A Labor member of the§House of
Commons has proposed a federation of
the British nations on the basis of the “tie
of common interest,” and envisages the
British Empire as a “self-contained and
self-sufficient world community,” each
nation taking a responsible part in in-
ternational policy. Such a “unity” would
place the Empire as a fully recognised
Power equal in strength and resources to
either the U.S. or Russia.,
There is no lack of evidence that other
British-minded statesmen are thinking
along similar lines, Canada’s Minister of
External Affairs has said “Canada seeks
to preserve her association with the
British Commonwealth as an instrument
through which we, with others sharing
our objectives, can co-operate for our
common good in peace as in war.” Sir
Andrew Russell, the N.Z. veteran of
1914-18, stresses the need for the
“reforming of the Empire into an
organic union or federation.” He advo-
cates the “pooling of resources,” and
even suggests that each member-nation
surrender its “individual sovereignty as
far as foreign policy and defence are
concerned.”
General Smuts has said that the
British system is necessary to the world.
It is even more necessary to the Empire.
It is not enough that the Empire played
a notable part in the two wars. Unity in
the struggle for peace is even more
urgent. If, through lack of unity, we are
to become subservient in peace, the sac-
rifice of human lives has beep in vain.
There are peace-minded men who still
seriously believe that only by example
(disarmament) can we hope to lead
nations into universal peace. Unfor-
tunately for them, recent history offers
no significance. Did our example after
the 1914-18 war deter either Hitler
or Mussolini? .Is it not yet realised
that the League of Nations failed be-
cause of its weakness? Can you point
to any period in man’s history, ancient
or recent, that would lend support to the
hope that nations are ready to divest
themselves of fear, envy, greed and
power lusts; that they are ready to sink
their racial differences in a common pool
of “universal brotherhood” and live
together in peace and harmony?
Unfortunately, the only cogent lessons
history has taught are that war appears
to be an integral part of human society
and that where there is strength there is
a tendency towards peace.
Where would Australia stand in this
plan to unite the British nations? An
island continent with a regrettably inade-
quate population and a tendency to cast
aside Empire tradition. Is the fact of
being Australians so absorbing as to make
us forget that we are Britishers too? —
J. A. (Fiji).

And no wonder, for in addition to being the
product of a great wireless organisation,
the new Radiola brings you outstanding
tonal reproduction and performance.
The Company’s laboratories are the finest
equipped and staffed in Australia. The
A. W. A. Radio-Electric Works, greatly
increased in size, met the demands of the
Services for radio equipment of the highest
technical design. Its output was larger than
that of any other wireless organisation in
Australia.
The post-war A.W.A. Radiola has gained
immeasurably by the higher technical skill
of A.W.A. scientists and engineers devel-
oped during war time. It is a superb
instrument of Radio entertainment unpa-
ralleled for tone and performance —one
which you will be proud to own.
Although large production is being maintained, your
nearest authorised Radiola distributor may have
difficulty in making early delivery due to the big
demand from all parts of Australia. He will, however,
gladly advise you and give details of models which
will be available.
