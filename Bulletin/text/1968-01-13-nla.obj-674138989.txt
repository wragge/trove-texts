" This Is Terrific !
Even I Can Handle
Our New Cartridge Stereo.”
Everyone will like making pre-recorded cartridge tapes for
enjoyment in their home, automobile or boat—in fact,
anywhere.
As Akai's latest model, it is everything you expect. Both
the 8-track and 4-track stereo cartridge recording and play-
back are great new developments. The later requires an
adaptor. You can transcribe with only this X-1800SD. All
sources of sounds can be recorded.
Of course, the X-1800SD is an all-solid state tape recorder
with the famous Cross-Field head and 4-track stereo/monaural
recording and playback reel-to-reel.

ONE MORE
WEEK
SPORTING NOTIONS
THIS SUMMER it was clearer than
ever that Australia, with its super-
efficient tennis players, with nothing
on their minds except the amount of
the professional contracts they sign as
soon as the match is over, had destroyed
whatever the Davis Cup stood for in
sport.
Now it seems the Sydney to Hobart
Yacht Race is going the same way.
This year’s winner on corrected times,
Rainbow II, is owned by a New Zealand
sailmaker; the second boat, Pen Duick
II, is owned by the French Govern-
ment, and the third, Matika, by a
Sydney company, Roe Hydraulic, and
is used to take important visitors out
on excursions.
Pen Duick was designed by its
skipper, Eric Tabarly, who is a serv-
ing French naval officer, and the
French Acadamy of Science and is
estimated to have cost $100,000, about
twice as much as any other boat in
the race. There is a picture of General
de Gaulle above the bulkheads and
most of the crew are in the French
Navy.
To keep its weight low, Pen Duick
has only 4 feet 6 inches headroom
below decks. It is a 58-foot, all-steel
schooner and weighs 10 tons, compared
with an all-steel Sydney boat of a
few years ago, Solo, which was 57 feet
and weighed 22 tons.
FOLLOW THE FLAG
AT THIS DISTANCE the “I Back
Britain” campaign sounds very for-
lorn. The enthusiastic workers who
are making Union Jacks with the
slogan “I Back Britain” on them to
distribute free to workers in need of
inspiration might reflect that the flag
when it was used for shirts, sunglasses,
and so on from Carnaby Street earned
far more for Britain in exports than it
did when it was at the top of the flag-
pole.
WILLIE'S NEPHEW
DESPITE the demands of Sydney’s
summer hospitality (“harder to
survive than the Agadir earthquake”),
Robin Maugham has already begun
work on the Australian research for his
new novel.
He is writing a fictional treatment
of the Tichborne case, which made
legal history in Britain a century ago
when a man from Wagga failed in his
claim to the rich Tichborne estate and
title.
Lord Maugham’s father, who was
Lord Chancellor of England, wrote a
history of the case. “In his book, my
father maintained that the claimant
was completely false and was act-
ually the son of a butcher and a bar-
maid in Wapping. But during the war,
when I was a trooper, I met one of the
family’s descendants, Sir Anthony Tich-
borne, and I was astonished at his
resemblance to the picture of the false
claimant in my father’s book.
“So I concluded that my father’s
theory had been wrong and I came up
with the idea that the claimant was
the illegitimate son of the baronet and
the half-brother of the real heir. Dur-
ing the case, he showed he knew a
great deal about the family, but there
were great gaps in his story. I think
he met his half-brother in Australia,
and the half-brother, who died here,
told him the facts he knew.”
Since Maugham’s is a fictional
account, he is free to set his Australian
scenes in any part of the country he
likes. He has chosen the area around
Bowral. “The claimant came to Aus-
tralia because he was sent to sea, and I
think Bowral is the kind of place he
would have picked to settle first, be-
cause it’s so beautiful, and because he
was a very good horseman. It’s great
country for riding. I’m going to spend
a fortnight there, while I’m writing my
notes, so I’ll actually have the feel of
the place.”
The necessity for geographical auth-
enticity is a lesson Lord Maugham
learned from his uncle, Somerset, and
it has taken him through a substantial
part of the world. “You can’t write if
you’re going to spend your whole life
in an ivory tower. You go out and rub
your nose in the dirt, then when you’ve
got it all it’s time to retire to the
ivory tower.”
With his rather large, rather soft
brown eyes and hesitant lisp, Lord
Maugham is the epitome of gentle
Robin Maugham ... “the name is a
disadvantage”
British unflappability, and it is hard to
imagine him rubbing his nose in any-
thing, but he has made several quite
surprising sorties from that ivory tower.
Probably the best known was his trip
to the Middle East in 1959 to gather
material for his book “The Slaves of
Timbuktu,” an expose of slave-
trafficking among the Tuareg tribesmen..
“I’d never even thought about this
until I actually saw some little African
children in fetters. I was horrified that
children should still be in chains in
modern times. So I determined to
spend six months among the Tuaregs
to prove what I knew to be a fact
that slavery still existed. I actually
bought a Bela tribesman owned by a
Tuareg for £37/10/-. I went with a
journalist named Michael Davidson and
we took a picture of the money chang-
ing hands.”
Maugham has written travel books,
plays, and several novels, all of which
are in paperback and some of which
have been bought for films. The rights
to his recent biography, “Somerset and
All the Maughams,” have been ac-

AUSTRALIA’S LEADING PERMANENT BUILDING SOCIETY
quired by a Hollywood company for a
film to be titled “Willie.” Lord
Maugham has just finished the script.
His current schedule is a busy one.
From Australia he goes to Mexico to
work on the next stage of his novel, he
must be in New York in September for
the publication of his last novel, “The
Second Window,” and there is, too, the
possibility that he will have to go to
Hollywood as consultant on the filming
of “Willie.”
Yet if it hadn’t been for a head in-
jury suffered in 1942, during the West-
ern Desert Campaign, Maugham would
not have been a writer, but a barrister.
“It’s what my family wanted. There
have been three generations of lawyers
on both sides of the family. But I
got hit in the head with a piece of
shrapnel and it affected my memory
not much, but you must be able to
remember facts very well if you’re go-
ing to be a barrister.
“I’d always been interested in writ-
ing. I wrote my first novel at the age
of nine. It was about an Egyptian
mummy. Anyway, while I was in
hospital after the head injury, I wrote
a war book, ‘Come to Dust.’ It was
reviewed very well, by Richard Dim-
bleby on the BBC first, and it sold out.
And I thought if I can make my
living out of writing, I will.”
Lord Maugham’s family was not en-
tirely pleased. His father had thought
his brother Somerset had sunk low in
becoming a professional writer, so was
far from delighted when his son fol-
lowed suit. Somerset doubted Robin
had the necessary ability, and, anyway,
thought that one Maugham writing was
enough.
When Lord Maugham completed his
novel “The Servant” (later made into
a film by Joseph Losey), his father’s
disapproval was so intense that he
ordered Lord Maugham to buy it back
from the publisher, offering to repay
him the £lOOO advance. “He thought
it was ‘unpleasant and disgusting’.”
Lord Maugham seems tolerant of all
these criticisms, but there is a visible
flash of pride when he comes to his
uncle’s eventual acceptance of him as
a writer. “He went to see my play
‘Odd Man In’ and adored it. Then
he read ‘November Reef,’ the last
novel I wrote during his lifetime, and
he wrote to the publishers, saying it
was a brilliant and satisfying book and
they could quote this if they liked.”
Somerset Maugham had no qualms
about basing the characters in his
novels on living people, but his
nephew’s characterisations are usually
composites. “Except when they’re
wholly imaginary. Sometimes a charac-
ter springs to mind fully formed and
that’s most exciting.
“I write pathetically slowly in a
large exercise book. Writing on one
side and correcting on the other, with
a. lot of crossing out. I remember my
uncle looking through one of my
manuscripts one day and coming to a
sentence he didn’t like. He said, ‘This
won’t do,’ and proceeded to re-write
it. He re-wrote that simple sentence
seven times before he got it right.
That’s the hardest thing — to write
simply and lucidly.”
In the House of Lords, Lord Maug-
ham sits on the cross-benches. “I dis-
approve of myself, of course — I dis-
approve of hereditary peerages. But
the House is a useful forum in which
to be heard if you do have something
to say — as I did about slavery.
“The name Maugham, though, has
been a disadvantage to me as a writer.
Because there are the inevitable com-
parisons.”—SANDRA HALL.
NOTHING IN MIND
IF FOR NOTHING ELSE, the Holly-
wood producer Judd Bernard will be re-
membered, after his visit here last week,
for one thing: he is the only American
film man to have set foot on these
shores in a decade who hasn’t come
with plans to make a film. He told The
Bulletin: “You haven’t got enough
facilities — for ‘Journey Out of Dark-
ness’ they even had to send to Holly-
wood for make-up. Australia is the one
country in the world that hasn’t pro-
duced a single director on the inter-
national scene.”
Bernard came up the hard way
(“I’m an overnight success — after 22
years”), and finally broke through the
way most new producers do in Holly-
wood these days: he bought a literary
property. “Anyone can become a pro-
ducer today. All you have to do is buy
a novel in galley proof, interest a star
in it, and go to a studio with a ‘pack-
age,’ suggesting director, writer, and
other players. Then the studio says yes
or no. If it says no, you go to another
studio.”
Bernard’s new film is an 1840s Mexi-
can story, “Blue,” with Terence Stamp
directed by Silvio (“Georgy Girl”)
Narizzano and a picture shot “back-to-
back” with it, about a girl who is work-
ing on “Blue,” with the producer,
director, and cast of “Blue” acting
themselves as minor players in a love
story.
His new plans would fill a volume,
and most are daring projects that he
feels are now possible in a. freer,
fresher Hollywood. “ ‘Negatives,’ for
instance. That’s a story about a man
and a woman in London who can’t
have sex unless he dresses up as Crip-
pen and she dresses up as Ethel Le
Neve. Then a German photographer
comes along and makes him dress up
as Baron von Richthofen. He finally
gets shot down in a plane of his own
invention on his rooftop. It’s a very
clean movie.” Mr. Bernard said.
“Then I want to make a film about
the Orpheus legend. And the Narcissus
legend. You know what I’m calling the
Narcissus picture? ‘Me.’ ”

OUT AND

It's in the cards:
a turbulent time
for our new PM
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
CLAIRVOYANT Marc de Pascale
knows it’s way out so perhaps he
shouldn’t mention it, but what he really
wants is to become adviser to the
Aga Khan. Or someone like that. At
any rate, to help someone who is
helping others. Meanwhile he guides
lesser mortals through life’s tricky
moments, assuaging them, amazing
them, delighting them, disappointing
them, and, occasionally, as in the case
of actress Hazel Phillips, sending them
off with murder in their hearts. “She
could’ve killed me when I told her
what I did,” says Mr. de Pascale, pass-
ing it on strictly entre nous } “wouldn’t
believe a word, but it all came true.”
Never mind, 1968 will be all right for
Miss Phillips. She is destined for
a glorious, scintillating year. All that
for $5.
Some clients arrive at Mr. de Pas-
cale’s house opposite the Globe Worsted
Mills in Marrickville, where he lives
with his friend Arthur and a fast cat
called Flash, expecting miracles. But
dreary old housewives leading dreary
old lives with nothing more momen-
tous on their minds than whether they
should bake a cake or not cannot
expect exciting readings. Actors and
people of that ilk, however, who live
in a tumult of electric-giving rays
enough to make Mr. de Pascale pass
out sometimes: he has to receive them
all ah, well, they’re different.
■“Sometimes,” he says, cutting slices of
Christmas cake and arranging them
on gold-bordered china plates, “some-
times when that front door closes be-
hind them, I rush round the house like
a caged lion, pacing backwards and
forwards, backwards and forwards, till
it’s all worked out of me. I’m left
positively drained.”
Today, however, he is not. He is
whirling around with a teapot and say-
ing he once danced with the Sadler’s
Wells Ballet in London for a spell in
the ’sixties, and that he followed this
up with some television and then, you’ll
not believe it, he got a job at the
Marylebone Magistrate’s Police Court
filling out summonses. His clairvoyancy,
now, is something he’s always had but
improved upon during a three-month
sojourn with some Spanish gipsies.
What they did to their children gave
him a turn, but they were lovely
people otherwise.
Anyway, once in Mr. de Pascale’s
house, past the potted plants and Bar-
rier Reef shells on the veranda, he
leads clients into a back room and sits
them on a chair by a cloth-covered
table. There, if his flashes are healthy,
he consults the Tarot cards. People
don’t like it if he says sorry, nothing’s
coming through, but what Mr. de Pas-
cale won’t do is pretend. The minute
he does, he says, his gift will go. Some
of his best flashes come over the tele-
phone, the thing doesn’t stop with
friends ringing all hours saying, come
on Marc, give us a flash, what shall
we do tomorrow? Well, yes, it is
exhausting, but nothing has ever beaten
the time he gave 75 readings non-stop,
ten minutes each, at one dollar a go,
for charity. How he got through it he
doesn’t know, but everyone enjoyed
what he told them; he supposes his
extra energy came from elsewhere, you
know, it’s a case of doing good for
others and being done good unto your-
self.
Just before Christmas, though, every-
one went mad. His diary was filled with
appointments and Arthur had to insist
on NO BOOKINGS TODAY for the
25th. Look. Arthur’s own capital letters
in pencil. Well, he’s not going to over-
book in the New Year, he simply
couldn’t keep it up.
The telephone rings and Mr. de Pas-
cale flies out of the room. A client.
He repeats three times the way to his
house, he always does, it’s the devil’s
own job to find, returns and says since
he changed his name everything is hap-
pening. Well, you see, a fellow clair-
voyant said he’d never get anywhere
unless he became Marc de Pascale, so
last December he got some new visiting
cards printed oh, and 100 copper
medallions made for clients to hang
on their key-rings for luck and he
hasn’t looked back. Well, they do it in
Hollywood all the time. They all con-
sult clairvoyants about their success
name. Yes, it is funny. But his has
worked. Publicity galore, newspaper
interviews, and all that. Come on our
programs, said Hazel Phillips and Dita
Cobb. Come on our cruise, said the
organisers of a charity party. If only,
breathes Mr. de Pascale with longing,
some nightclub owner would say come
on his staff. That is if the Aga Khan’s
idea doesn’t come off.
Meanwhile, Mr. de Pascale has had
an important flash: Australia’s new
Prime Minister will be tall, in his
sixties, have mid-color hair, hazel eyes,
and, oh, goodness, around June will
have a turbulent time when there will
be demonstrations about no, not
Vietnam but about the independ-
ence of Australia. “It sounds way out,”
says Mr. de Pascale, eyes wide at the
thought, “but it’s all there.”
So, he adds, is the future of this
writer: she’ll develop into something
big like Andrea.

Ancient India used stone to build specta-
cular temples. In contrast, modern India uses
concrete with equally spectacular results. To
the fabulous designs of le Corbusier, famous
architect, a new 20th century city has risen
at Chandigarh.
t££e
Every region of India has its own distinc-
tive ivory and silverwork, fine wool stoles
and rugs. You’ll find saree silk in a thousand
colours and weaves —at low prices. The
friendly Indian people (and you’ll meet so
many!) will help you choose.
The Periyar sanctuary teems with elephants.
Take photographs from a launch; catch
unforgettable wild-life scenes. In the same
region are pleasant waterways, sandy beaches,
a thousand ancient temples, festivals and
classical Indian dances.
Today you can stay in luxurious, modern,
air-conditioned hotels for as little as $lO.OO
a day, including first-class meals. In smaller
hotels you’ll find cleanliness, comfort and
wonderful, helpful service—at even lower
rates.
Even when you’ve seen the Taj Mahal (and you must)
you’ve still a whole world to explore in India, land of
infinite variety. In every region of India there are fascin-
ating differences, not only in climate and scenery, but in
the people, their customs and dress, in their festivals and
dances, arts and crafts, architecture and occupations.
Today you don’t need mosquito nets and bearers, topees
and all the rest of it. India has moved into the twentieth
century, with air-conditioning, filtered pools, cool restaur-
ants and inviting bars.

And your money buys so much in India (8.40 rupees
to the dollar!). Modern accommodation, meals, sightseeing
and incidentals needn’t cost more than $12.00 a day! And
think of the bargains you can find in the bazaars . . .
We haven’t changed a bit. Indians are still the most
hospitable, courteous and friendly folk. You’ll feel
welcome. Commonwealth citizens need no visa, no foreign
dictionary. English is spoken throughout the country.
That’s why India’s helpful Tourist Service makes you
this offer. Just tell them what kind of people you like;
where your interests lie. They’ll arrange introductions —
to Indian families at home, to business people, students,
men and women in all walks of life. You’ll find friends in
India. And you’ll learn so much more about this fascinat-
ing ancient-yet-modern country.
And modern India is so easy to get to. International
shipping and airlines call frequently at cities conveniently
close to the centres of interest. Ask your travel agent
about India —or contact Government of India Tourist

ON THE
MARGIN
Standing in
tears amid the
alien porn
BY ROSS CAMPBELL
THE RECENT action of the Customs
Department in allowing a single
monthly issue of “Playboy” magazine
to be admitted to Australia caused a
good deal of uneasiness. Many have
been wondering whether it showed a
weakening of the Department’s fibre,
and could, indeed, lead to a regular
admission of American magazines of
this type. Our local pornography in-
dustry is still struggling to establish
itself. Those who have courageously
invested capital in it are asking: what
will our hopes of survival be, if the
floodgates are thrown open to unfair
overseas competition?
This country made a late entry into
the field. In their easy-going way, Aus-
tralians remained in their traditional
rut and failed to understand the im-
portance of pornography. It was not
until they saw the spectacular advances
of the industry in Britain and the
U.S.A. that they realised its great
economic potential.
Even then, local publishers had
trouble in obtaining suitable material.
The older school of writers, artists,
and photographers was too accus-
tomed to the inhibitions of an earlier
day to convert to modern requirements.
P. G. Wodehouse once summed up
this problem. He said regretfully:
“Pornography wasn’t allowed when I
began to write, and I never learned
how to do it.”
However, the more enterprising pub-
lishers here were not disheartened.
They had some success in training keen
young photographers, who in turn were
able to find models with an aptitude
for pin-up work. There is no doubt
that Australia has large untapped re-
serves of talent in the latter field.
But the industry is handicapped by
the limited size of the home market.
The economies of scale available to
big overseas organisations like “Play-
boy” and “Cavalier” are denied to
Australian pomographers, however
energetic and capable they may be.
Also, the attitude of Commonwealth
and State authorities has been unsym-
pathetic. Although a vigorous growth
of pornography is essential if Australia
is to take its place in the forefront of
contemporary culture, nothing in the
nature of a subsidy has been offered.
In some States Queensland has a
bad record in this regard there has
been active discouragement. The only
comfort to battling entrepreneurs was
the support of the Customs Depart-
ment, which afforded a measure of
protection against the mass-produced
foreign product. Hence the alarm over
the admission of September “Playboy.”
Mr. Tom Peeker, proprietor of the
weekly “Australeer,” was pessimistic
when he talked to me. “Given a fair
chance, this country can produce
pomographers equal to any in the
world,” he said. “But the situation is
too restricting. Our brightest young
men are going abroad. In America, of
course, the opportunities are limitless.
In Britain they can hope for plum
jobs like appointment as Pornographer
Royal. Those who stay here tend to
lose enthusiasm. .Some of our best hard-
core pomographers are going soft.”
On the other hand, far-sighted over-
seas operators are beginning to see Aus-
tralia as a growth market. Mr. Merlin
Pottle, dynamic founder of the thriving
English publications “Itch” and “Urge,”
has transferred his headquarters to
Sydney. He said to me: “Some Aus-
tralians are uneasy about the influx of
overseas capital to develop the pornog-
raphy industry here. But the task is
too big for local investors to tackle
alone. Australia has the raw materials
in abundance; I aim to supply English
know-how and financial expertise.”
Merlin Pottle thinks big. “I intend
to go into film production, too,” he
said. “People wonder why Australian
films have never broken into the big
time abroad. The answer is simple:
they’re too clean. But we are going
to change that. Before long we’ll be
giving the Swedes and Italians a run
for their money.”
He believes that the job-creating
aspect of his operations will result in
more favorable treatment from the
Government. “Our magazines will soon
have a 95 percent Australian content,”
he said. “I see no reason why we
shouldn’t build up a healthy export
trade in pornography with Asia and
even the U.S.A.”
One hopes that this buoyant faith
in Australia will be justified. There is
still a good deal of public apathy here
toward the kinky. The Commonwealth
Literary Fund could set a wholesome
example by making a grant to the
young scholar who is translating the
Kama Sutra into Strine.


The new PM’s
first Asian tour
COMMENT
BY
“OBSERVER”
OBVIOUSLY THE NEW Prime Min-
ister should arrange an Asian tour for
himself once he is settled in to office.
No Australian Prime Minister is now
imaginable without one. It will mark
his real inauguration into his new job.
The best possible itinerary he could
plan would be a visit limited to Aus-
tralia’s immediate neighborhood
Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, and the
Philippines. The purpose of his journey
should be to enter into informal private
discussions with the political leaders of
each of these countries to find out in
what ways they think there can be the
beginnings of useful co-operation be-
tween their four nations and Australia.
Obviously the discussions have to be
private and to be stimulatory rather
than decisive, but the Prime Minister
in his speeches at banquets, airports,
Press conferences, and so forth should
stress that Australia supports the idea
of regional co-operation and mutual
security to whatever extent seems
practicable.
Our Prime Minister should invite
the Prime Minister of New Zealand to
come on the trip with him. “Aus-
tralia and New Zealand” are words
that go together among our neighbors
in a way that is unimaginable to Aus-
tralians (who usually do not think of
New Zealand at all) and to New Zea-
landers (who usually think of Australia
only with distrust). While they are
flying from one place to the next, the
two Prime Ministers might discuss
some of the problems involved in this
combination of Australian indifference
and New Zealand scepticism. It would
seem rather hollow for Australia to
urge others to examine methods of co-
operation when it has done so little
to attempt this with New Zealand.
It is essential in discussing the pros-
pects of co-operation among the four
nations of the Malay Archipelago to
remember that, while their populations
add up to a figure something like 12
times the Australian population, never-
theless their four national incomes add
up to less than Australia’s, and so does
the total value of their exports. In
economic strength Australia alone is
equal to all four of them combined.
It is up to Australia to use some of
this economic strength. One obvious
way is to make special tariff concessions
for the import of their goods; another
is to increase training programs and
other direct assistance schemes; another
is to provide more direct aid in the
form of Australian-manufactured pro-
ducers’ goods.
Very special attention should be paid
to Indonesia’s shattered economy; we
should increase our contributions
toward propping up the shambles
Sukarno left behind him. We should
also pay special attention to the
economic consequences of the British
pull-out from Singapore. So far as pos-
sible, this kind of neighborliness should
be devised to encourage what already
exists (tariff concessions are the most
obvious example) rather than be an act
of charity, but in the case of Indonesia
money will also help.
It was an Australian External Affairs
Minister, Sir Percy Spender, who laid
most of the groundwork for the
Colombo Plan. (It was only British
jealousy that stopped it from being
called “the Spender Plan.”) It is time
that we took some fresh initiative of
this kind (perhaps in co-operation with
Japan). It is a way of showing that
we mean business '
In the general questions of regional
security our most important task is one
that we can afford, but that so far we
i i , t j . .
have not had the brains and imagina-
tion to produce, and that is an increase
in oui military stiength. Military
strength is not measured in the amount
of money you spend or the number of
interdepartmental committees you set
up, but in what fighting troops you can
put on the ground, what aircraft you
can put in the air, and what naval
vessels you can put on the sea. It is
time we pushed the Government
officials and senior service officers along
so that they give us more for the
money we are spending than they do
now. They should, above all, be made to
lower their standards so that we get
more for our money. What we want is
a fighting force that is credible and
effective within the area in which we
live, not one that meets some inter-
national concept of military perfection,
but only in bits.
Our long-term diplomatic aim
should be a mutual security pact be-
tween ourselves and the nations of the
Malay Archipelago, an agreement to
respect each other’s sovereignty, and a
proclamation of joint resistance to
external aggression. It is within this
longer-term context that we should hold
discussions with Singapore and Malaysia
about the effects of the British pull-
out: our thinking must go beyond the
garrison mentality, and we must con-
cern ourselves with Indonesia and the
Philippines as well as Singapore and
Malaysia.
Initial experiments in co-operation
might be of a stnall scale. So far as
Australia, is concerned it certainly
seems time for us to set up a body
which would promote more extensive
cultural, intellectual, and social
exchanges with these four nations. Per-
haps it is also time for us to determine
which kinds of trained, educated per-
sons in these countries have been
trained for jobs that don’t exist for
them in their own countries. We could
then offer them jobs here.
Why the Labor Party’s
been lying doggo
COMMENT
BY
ALAN
REID
With the exception of the irrepres-
sible Arthur Augustus Calwell, Labor
parliamentarians have maintained a
canny silence during the past fortnight.
They sat back and enjoyed the spectacle
of the Liberal-Country Party Coalition
fighting over who should succeed
Harold Holt.
It is not that the travail of the
Coalition partners in the selection of a
new Prime Minister did not provide
Labor with plenty of verbal ammuni-
tion. It did. But Labor has been work-
ing on the sound political adage:
“Never interfere when your enemies
are fighting interference might re-
concile them.”
Now, however, Labor has no reason
to be inhibited. It can proceed to ex-
ploit the situation. Labor is in a lovely
position. Take the implications which
flow from the public announcement by
CP Leader Mr. McEwen that he would
not serve in a Government headed by
Treasurer William McMahon.
In view of McEwen’s refusal to
disclose his reasons, Labor is entitled to
presume that the reasons were either
(1) personal, (2) policy, or (3) im-
propriety on McMahon’s part. If they
were personal, they had to be weighty
personal reasons. Dislike of a man or
even the belief that he did not like
the CP (few in the Liberal Party do)
are hardly sufficient reasons to produce
decisions that affect the future of a
nation, and a coalition that has endured
for 18 years. Just think of the field of
innuendo that opens up against the
unfortunate McMahon. The Labor
Party will undoubtedly exploit it, and
in doing so will open up further fields.
Then there is policy. Whatever else
may be said about McMahon, as
Treasurer he has tried to implement
Liberal policy. As it was on Liberal
policy (as modified to meet the re-


quirements of the CP, the junior
partners in the Coalition) that the pre-
sent Government was returned to office,
this was a correct and proper attitude.
It was adherence to this policy that
brought him into conflict with McEwen.
For years Labor has been trying
unsuccessfully to establish that it was
the CP minority, with its narrower,
regional policies, which dictated Gov-
ernment policy. McEwen’s move against
McMahon, though complicated by per-
sonal factors, could justifiably be in-
terpreted as a CP move to dominate
economic policymaking.
As I see it, the new Government
is not going to have an easy time in
the two years ahead. It will undoubt-
edly close its ranks, and try to recreate
an impression of solidarity and dura-
bility. But it will not be able to con-
trol the situation completely.
The Government, however, is not
without important assets. Number one
is Mr. Calwell. Calwell has returned
from his overseas trip dedicated to
“stirring the possum” as he color-
fully describes it on the question of
Australia’s role in Vietnam.
Calwell’s destructive powers are im-
pressive. Opposition Leader Gough
Whitlam has been doing well because
he has superimposed a gloss upon
Labor’s Vietnam policy, still, basic-
ally, in my view, the identical policy
on which Labor, with Calwell as
Leader, disastrously lost in the 1966
Federal elections. Calwell is deter-
mined to strip the gloss away, and
there is not much Whitlam can do
about restricting Calwell’s activities.
Calwell suffers from only one dis-
advantage. Labor’s LeTt Wing is be-
ginning to scent office. They can see a
chance of the working out of the thesis
of those Labor Left-wingers who for
years have preached “Labor does not
have to change its policy spots
ultimately the Liberal-CP coalition will
shake to pieces and we will be the
only ones available' to fill the power-
vacuum.”
Labor’s Left Wing does not mind the
Whitlam Vietnam version, particularly
if it gets them into power. They are
more concerned with what is hard
Labor policy. They believe that with
the prospects of office dangling allur-
ingly in front of him, Whitlam will not
be nearly as anxious as he has been
to change Labor’s Vietnam policy. This
attitude may result in Calwell losing
some of the platforms that the Left
Wing were planning for him.
Asset number two for the Govern-
ment is the Democratic Labor Party.
If Labor’s Left Wing co-operates with
Whitlam to the extent of allowing him
to keep the gloss while they retain
the reality of the Labor policy on
Vietnam, DLP hostility to the Labor
Party will intensify. All hope of future
reconciliation would vanish. And while
the DLP electoral cushion remains,
a non-Labor Government has pros-
pects of survival whatever its internal
difficulties.
Baseless hopes for U.S.
“offsetting policies”
COMMENT
BY
PETER
SAMUEL
IT WAS FINE public relations, but
last Friday’s statement by temporary
Prime Minister Mr. McEwen on the
outcome of the foreign investment
talks with the American team under
Mr. Eugene Rostow was complete
baloney. Mr. McEwen said in a pre-
pared statement read to journalists
that night in Parliament House that
the Australian Government had got
the Americans to agree that their
measures would have a significant im-
pact “in the absence of offsetting
policies.”
These supposed offsetting policies, it
transpired, were a familiar package
designed to improve the U.S.-Austra-
lian trade balance in our favor—larger
U.S. military procurements here, re-
duced duties on wool and zinc, and
improved access for beef. These “em-
braced what was necessary to protect
Australia,” Mr. McEwen said. Wash-
ington would consider them immedi-
ately. There, in Saturday’s news-
papers, was the required story: hard-
bargaining, tough Jack McEwen fights
again for Australia.
But the Americans have no intention
whatever of agreeing to any “offsetting
policies.” They would not have
applied stringent restraints on the
investment activities of their own com-
panies only to have the effects lost
through a series of unilateral trade
concessions or changes in their military
purchasing policy.
We had our chance to negotiate
down the tariffs on wool and zinc
and enlarge the quotas on beef im-
mediately after the Kennedy Round of
tariff-cutting talks in July last year.
Mr. McEwen at that time was offered
concessions on these in return for a
share of the local tobacco market and
small reductions in the tariffs on several
manufactured items. Mr. McEwen
declared an expansion of the Austra-
lian tobacco industry and the existing
tariff protection of a handful of manu-
facturers more important than the pos-
sibility of expanded U.S. markets for
our wool, meat, and zinc producers.
The issue of improved access for
these three products had of course crop-
ped up before many times. Each time-
our Government (in this context, the
Department of Trade) has failed to
make realistic recriprocal offers. Presi-
dent Johnson, in making his message
to the American people on the balance
of payments measures, did speak of the
needs for going ahead with trade lib-
eralisation and proceeding beyond the
achievements of the Kennedy Round.
But with the American dollar under
pressure, the U.S. is less likely now
than ever to grant us concessions on
wool, zinc, and meat without equivalent
tariff reductions on our part. As for
U.S. military procurement in Australia,
the Americans have already removed
most of the purely mechanical barriers.
American military needs are advertised
here and there is an office to receive
tenders in Sydney.
The time to negotiate firm American
purchases in Australia is when we are
ourselves considering buying American
equipment. If time had been taken
over the F-11l and missile destroyer
purchases, we could, no doubt, have
got ourselves some offsetting orders.
Mr. McEwen cannot really believe
there is any chance of getting any such
concession at this time. The U.S.
balance of payments is far less healthy
than then and we have nothing to offer
in return. In telling his countrymen
that he has great hopes for American
concessions in these areas, Mr. Mc-
Ewen is trying to make cheap political
capital. It is on such baseless hopes—
loudly trumpeted while merely hopes
and then forgotten—that he has tried to
maintain in recent years his reputation
as a man who fights particularly hard
and effectively for Australian interests.
The joint U.S.-Australian com-
munique issued on Saturday fully con-
firms the view that Mr. McEwen’s Fri-
day statement was “managed news” at
its most misleading. The communique
came, of course, as an anticlimax and
received less publicity. But its text
reveals a quite different outcome to
that retailed by Mr. McEwen’s P.R.
man on Friday night. The Saturday
joint communique said that the Aus-
tralian Government had accepted the
need for the American investment con-
trol program. The logic of this would
be that we would not seek “offsetting
policies” to undermine it. And, indeed,
there wa'S no mention of offsetting poli-
cies in the official joint communique,
only of the fact that our representatives
at the talks had impressed on Mr.
Rostow the need to “keep any adverse
effect of the U.S. measures to a mini-
mum.” The Americans offered no
undertakings, only sweet phrases, “care-
ful study over a period of time,” and
“close consultation at both the political
and official levels . . .”
And why should they offer Mr.
McEwen more, especially since over the
years he has (with the Left-wingers of
the Labor Pa‘rty) been one of the
leading critics of American investment
in Australia. Many times he has ex-
pressed the view that we would be
better off without much of it. Here we
have the U.S. administration doing just
what Mr. McEwen was unable to per-
suade the Australian Cabinet to do
itself. And he claims to expect “offset-
ting policies!”


AUSTRALIA
The socialites give way
to the professionals
WHEN HAROLD HOLT joined the
Menzies Government in 1939 he was
one of the three men in the Govern-
ment with a university degree.* The
succeeding years of Labor Govern-
ment saw Australia run by a team of
20 with only three degrees between
them, two of them held by Dr. H. V.
Evatt. Now Labor’s four parliamen-
tary leaders alone share six degrees
and in the unprecedented run for office
that Australia has witnessed since
Harold Holt’s death the contest for the
succession was between an M.A.
(Oxon.), an M.A. (Cantab.), an
M.A. (Perth), an LL.B. (Melb.), and
an LL.B. B.Ec. (Syd.). There was
even discussion as to which of the con-
tenders were “true intellectuals.”
What are now coming of age in Aus-
tralian politics, for better or worse,
are the kind of men, of whom there
were a trickle of young chaps in the
1920 s and 1930 s and something of a
stream in the 19405, who assumed that,
whatever factors may determine dif-
ferences between political leaders, lack
of education should not be one of
them. Whereas a lack of education
was once an advantage a kind of
badge of sincerity. it is now likely
to be a disadvantage in Australian
politics as it has long been in almost
all of the rest of the world. The
generation that believes in education
is now having its victory in politics
(it remains to be seen, of course, what
kind of victory it will be) as it had
its victory 20 to 25 years ago in the
public service, when the graduates be-
gan to move in and take over.
Degrees, of course, are not always a
measure of professional ability. Health
Minister Forbes has three degrees, but
he was one of the most ineffectual men
in the Holt Government and one of
those most likely to be dropped by the
new Prime Minister.
What is more to the point is that
the Government of Australia does
gradually seem to be acquiring men
more professionally fitted to their jobs.
Mr. McMahon, with his economics
degree, has obviously done much better
in the job as Treasurer than either
Solicitor Holt or Clerk Fadden. Mr.
Hasluck, with his background as a
lecturer and writer in history and as
a former diplomat, was better fitted to
handle the External Affairs Depart-
ment than many others. (His faults
were political, not professional.)
Lawyer Snedden was far more of a
hustler than Mr. Opperman, though he
didn’t ride a bicycle. Businessman
Fairhall, with his interest in technology,
seemed to know what he was doing
when he ran the Supply Ministry.
With the new Prime Minister there
is bound to be a further increase in
professional competence. Kevin Cairns,
of Queensland, with a thorough under-
standing of economics and plenty of
ideas for the reform of social services,
plus a dentist’s practice, is likely to get
a junior portfolio. Philip Lynch, with
a background as a professional
management consultant, is another ob-
viously well qualified for a position. So
is Andrew Peacock. From N.S.W. Mr.
Tom Hughes, if he can afford to give
up his barrister’s practice, is well quali-
fied to take one of the Service Minis-
tries perhaps the Army, when, as is
inevitable, Mr. Malcolm Fraser is pro-
moted to a more senior position.
It may turn into a routing of the
city socialites by the young profes-
sionals. One of Sir Robert Menzies’
most pernicious habits was to drive
out of his Government many of the
more able, pushful characters and re-
place them with the more easily
accommodated young men with nice
manners who always hover in and
around conservative parties. It is hard
to see the new Prime Minister having
a bar of Mr. Howson, for instance.
It is in the Country Party that the
new Prime Minister will have trouble
getting new Ministerial personnel if he
should choose to rid himself of the
less than brilliant Territories Minister
Barnes or Repatriation’s McKellar.
The educational level of CP parlia-
mentarians is indicated in the fact that
the 28 hold only two degrees between
the lot of them. (
The most extraordinary feature of
the three-week period following Mr.
Holt’s death, in which the Liberal con-
tenders put themselves up for the
Prime Ministership, was that it hap-
pened. Australia has never before
known such an open debate on a
political succession. Into three weeks
we crammed some of the processes
that occur over six months in a U.S.
presidential year. This seemed to have
significant results.
One was a quick reversal in .publicly
expressed images of the leadership of
the Liberal Party. The first reaction

was “What a lot of no-'hopers. They’ll
never find a man good enough to be
the Prime Minister.” By the end of the
three weeks it was “The Labor Party
haven’t got as many good men as the
Liberals.”
The second result was that the
length of the process (even if it was
only three weeks) seemed to lead to
subtle changes in evaluation of the
candidates. For example Mr. McMahon
the man who made his run too
early was down on points even be-
fore Mr. McEwen’s boycott of him.
People had already made up their
minds about him. But the longer the
other contenders came out in public,
the more re-evaluation there was of
Mr. McMahon: his faults and virtues
prematurely considered because of
his premature candidacy were com-
pared with the faults and virtues of
the others. Given a bit more time, Mr.
McMahon’s point score would have in-
creased.
But the most significant thing about
the campaign for the succession was
that it stimulated interest in politics.
There has probably never before been
so much open discussion about what
people would like to see in a Prime
Minister of Australia. That most of this
discussion might have displeased some
professional political scientists is hardly
a criticism of it: it is judgment that
counts in these matters not expert
knowledge, and in this mattter politi-
cal scientists are no more privileged
than anyone else.
Fairhall
The candidate who never was
ONE OF Allen Fairhall’s favorite
quotations is industrialist Charles Ket-
tering’s “We ought to be interested in
the future, that’s where we are going
to spend the rest of our lives.” But
Fairhall decided early last week that
his future was not exclusively in poli-
tics, and that he didn’t want to spend
the rest of his life as Prime Minister.
For one thing, his health isn’t the
best. A year ago he had a major in-
testinal operation and his doctor told
him it would be unwise to take on
additional burdens. He might, had he
decided to take the risk, have been a
Prime Minister for only as long as
Harold Holt, presenting the Labor
Party with another raw candidate in
two years’ time.
For another thing, Allen Fairhall has
a disability rare in politicians; a nag-
ging doubt about whether he is in the
right business. He has frequently told
people he thinks he made a mistake in
going into politics and that he is think-
ing of getting out. He has talked of tak-
ing up business more seriously. (He al-
ready has a very successful business
manufacturing dummy models for shop-
window displays of women’s clothing.)
And he is an active amateur “radio
ham.” And likes to spend long days off
Newcastle deep-sea fishing.
Yet as soon as Mr. Holt disappeared
and the succession became a source of
'speculation, Mr. Fairhall was one of
the favorites for the job. Some said it
would be between him and Senator
Gorton, others between him and Mr.
Hasluck.
He has obvious qualities. Beside
Senator Gorton he ranked as obviously
the most “presentable” of the possible
contenders. He is an affable and cheery
yet serious man, with the flow of
words which television requires, and an
unmatched ability to put an idea in
simple striking terms. Excellent in in-
terviews, but not quite aggressive
enough to be a good debater. He
appears (possibly a little deceptively)
to exude hustle and a determination
to get on with the job a quality
which the late Harold Holt unfortun-
ately lacked so lamentably.
Fairhall has made few mistakes in
his political career. Like Gorton,
McMahon, and Hasluck he was a
forty-niner, coming in on the great
wave of politicians who joined the
enlarged Parliament which saw the
end of Chifley Labor rule. He held
the Ministry of Works, then the
Ministry of the Interior, and then the
Ministry of Supply and administered
them well, if not very imaginatively.
Holt gave him his real boost to the
top bracket of the Cabinet when he
promoted him from the Department
of Supply to the Department of De-
fence in January 1960, giving him fifth
Cabinet place after McEwen,
McMahon, and Hasluck.
In addition to being presentable and
safe, Mr. Fairhall was attractive to
his colleagues because he is personally
popular the epitome of a “good
mixer.” He spends more time than
most Cabinet Ministers with his Par-
liamentary colleagues, acting as one
of the best transmission belts of rank-
and-file sentiment to the Inner Cabi-
net. •
Fairhall was not short of ideas. Some
of his thinking was unusually original
for a member of the Holt Government.
All along, for instance, he said that
the Vietnam struggle was political and
psychological in nature as well as
military and in several underreported
speeches he elaborated interestingly on
this proposition. He has been quick
to see the need for change in defence
organization and strategy. And yet he
seems so far at least to be lacking in
the ability to achieve a vigorous
follow-through, to get his very relevant
ideas translated into practical reforms
of programs. His years in Defence,
1966 and 1967, were, with the big de-
fence build-up, a great opportunity for
reorganization and change, but the
opportunity was largely lost.
It may be something to do with
the difference between the Australian
businessman and the American. Fair-
hall, a typical Australian businessman,
is simply not capable of the sort of
management revolution which a man
like McNamara can engineer. He is
not a systems man.
Fairhall’s abiding interests and
special knowledge lie in science and
technology. As Minister for Defence he
has spoken well on strategy matters,
talking intelligently of regional co-
operation and Vietnam in particular.
But it is said that on his tour of the
U.S., for instance, he showed far more
interest talking microcircuitry to
General Dynamics than North Viet-
namese logistics in Cambodia with
State Department officers. His best
speeches have been on technology. Per-
haps this is the reason he has let Ex-
ternal Affairs make the running in
Allen Fairhall ... decision not to spend the rest of his life as P.M.


defence policy, if any running there
has been.
He has spoken passionately of the
engineer’s lack of recognition in Aus-
tralia, of the need for improved tech-
nological education. He has shown an
understanding of the challenge of
manufacturing exports, something
which could well be learnt in the
Department of Trade and Industry:
“There is only a marginal future for us
competing in export markets with big-
ger and more experienced manufac-
turers whose designs we are using, un-
less we produce with superb efficiency.
Despite handicaps, develop an export
market we must. It will call for
specialisation, intensified effort in re-
search and product development in
which we must depart the easier path
of the copyist and become innovators.
It has been done before with notable
success by the Dutch, by the Swiss, and
by Scandinavian countries . . .”
The new Prime Minister might like
to take science and technology ser-
iously, in which case Mr. Fairhall
would make an outstanding Minister.
Or otherwise he would make a first-rate
Minister for Trade and Industry,
should Mr. McEwen find a Govern-
ment including Mr. McMahon too
much to bear.
Defence talks
Trusting the Brits
THE CANBERRA DEFENCE and
foreign policy machine is getting
exactly nowhere in the task of pro-
ducing the “major reappraisal” pro-
mised six months ago by Mr. Holt at
the time of the British White Paper.
The trouble seems to be a cloud of
disagreements about where we stand.
There are some who say the British
will still come to the Anzac-Malaysia-
Singapore party with a continuing
mini-presence. Others chuckle cynically
at this. Others again say that we must
wait to see how ASEAN (Indonesia,
Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and the
Philippines) and other ideas for
regional co-operation develop and see
whether we cannot hang our military
assistance and security treaties in there.
The most conservative people of all
are those who insist that we must wait
on the end of the Vietnam war before
we can do anything new which may
mean many years of inaction.
The accelerated British withdrawal
announced at Christmas has at least
shaken the complacency out of those
who argued we had seven or eight
years before the British were gone. It
has also strengthened the view that
the British actually intend to be out
of Malaysia by December, 1969. This
fact was reported in a cable by an
Australian Government representative
George Thomson ... compensation
in Kuala Lumpur in the early months
of 1967. He had seen detailed plans
of British troop movements. But the
cable report was dismissed at the time
in Canberra as being “stupid” and
probably was never sent to Ministerial
level. Defenders of this representative
say that his cable was an accurate
presentation of firm British plans, and
theorise that the British have been
shifting only in their public stance.
Each time there is an economic crisis
or Leftist fuss within the Labor Party,
the Wilson Government simply shifts
its public policy closer to its real
policy. According to this theory we
are only one crisis off the December
1969 evacuation date’s announcement.
The very most that the Australian
Government now hopes to get out of
Mr. George Thomson is an assurance
of generous financial compensation for
Singapore in converting the evacuated
naval shipyards into a commercial
proposition. It hopes that the British
will not cancel their Fill or Polaris
submarine orders, and it may at last
be ready to offer to provide facilities
for them in Australia should they. be
deployed in this part of the world.
The trouble here was first the Treasury,
which bucked at the cost of develop-
ing Cockburn Sound for the British
Polaris subs afid Darwin for their
Fills. Now the principal opposition
to offering the British to construct
these facilities is a complete lack of
trust in the British Government.
“We can trust the British these days
Adam Malik ... defence relations
about as much as we can trust the
Chinese” was the non-attributible
remark of one senior man. Defence
and Foreign Affairs people simply cal-
culate there is a good likelihood the
British would have us build them
facilities and then bingo, another
crisis find it impossible to fullfil
their part of the deal. And we’d be
left with empty submarine pens and
unused avionics-servicing factories.
Australia’s offers to Malaysia and
Singapore are not yet even starting to
form, for the reason that the Govern-
ment cannot be got to accept the need
for a continuation of the 1965-67 de-
fence build-up. A three-year program
spanning the three financial years June,
1968, to June, 1971, is far behind
schedule, and until this is settled it
simply must be by the end of March
our diplomats will not even be able to
know what the Australian military
will have to offer in the way of bat-
talions.
By all accounts there is no defini-
tive understanding in the Australian
Government of the Indonesian attitude
to our military relations with Malay-
sia and Singapore. Very sensibly our
Foreign Affairs people and Service
Ministers insist that whatever we pro-
pose to Lee and Razak must be
acceptable to Indonesia, but no one
seems to have done the spadework to
find out what the Indonesians would
find acceptable and what not.
“We don’t know what we are likely
to be proposing, so we don’t want to
scare the Indonesians with something
hypothetical,” say the diplomats.
Which neatly completes the circle of
inaction and uninitiative, justifying
everybody in doing nothing for the
time being.
However, as foreign notables call in
on us, the circle may at last be broken.
The British Mr. Thomson, of the
Commonwealth Relations Office, will
be followed early next month by Indo-
nesian Foreign Minister Adam Malik,
and during his week here he must tell
our people something of his Govern-
ment’s attitude to Anzac-Malaysia-
Singapore defence relations.
Calwell
What possum?
JUST AS PEOPLE were beginning
to ask “whatever happened to Arthur
Calwell?” he emerged with his old-
fashioned hats and phrases from the
liner Fairstar after a seven-month
world tour. “Stirring the possum,” his
latest effort for the revival of English
prose, set the cartoonists and sub-
editors leaping with delight and it left
the political commentators wondering.
What exactly did he mean? In the
United States the phrase means the
exposing of a pretender or the un-


masking of a fraud. In Australia it
is generally used to mean stirring up
.trouble. Mr. Calwell is not revealing
just what he meant, but there are two
things in the Labor Party which he
regards as conspiracies.
One is the exploration by senior
Labor officials of the possibility of
some kind of accommodation, even
eventual unity, with the DLP. The
other is Mr. Whitlam’s change of
emphasis of Labor policy on Vietnam.
In London Mr. Calwell said, “ALP
policy in regard to Vietnam was not
changed by the August Federal Con-
ference in Adelaide, and no one
should try to misinterpret the position
Arthur Calwell. .. no evasion
by evasion or equivocation.” The shaft
was clearly aimed at Mr. Whitlam.
A day later he said, “There is a
conspiracy by certain interests, backed
by the Press, to work out an agree-
ment with the DLP to elect a Labor
Government on a foreign policy 100
percent pro-American.” He named the
“Sydney Morning Herald” and the
Melbourne “Age” as two of the Press
interests involved. He added, “I will
stir up my friends and fellow members
of the Party.”
Mr. Calwell’s friends are the Vic-
torian ALP central executive, Mr.
Chamberlain and his followers in
Western Australia, the Queensland
ALP central executive, and the faction
in Federal Caucus generally led by Dr.
Cairns. The possums, a l’Americain,
could be Mr. Whitlam, ALP Federal
secretary Mr. Wyndham, the pro-
Whitlam “Labor Comment” group in
Melbourne, and the New South Wales
ALP executive.
Since his return, Mr. Calwell has
stirred only his Christmas and New
Year mail he sends out about 1500
Christmas and New Year greetings
each year and receives not many
fewer in return. He has been wprking
at it from 9 to 6 every day, and despite
trouble with arthritis has recovered the
energy which seemed to have left him
during the latter days of his time
as Opposition Leader.
His supporters claim that Mr. Cal-
well will press his Vietnam policy in
Federal Caucus and the House of
Representatives so resolutely that Mi.
Whitlam will have to repudiate official
Labor policy to restore the damage.
If Mr. Whitlam remains silent he faces
the danger of allowing his formei
Leader to become the Party’s chief
spokesman on foreign policy. In either
case, Mr. Calwell will have the
initiative. Unless he sets himself up
as a dummy Mr. Whitlam knocks
down.
Such a situation would invite the
new Prime Minister to join in the
stirring himself: fauna supplied by the
Opposition.
$10 forgeries
A few or a lot?
LAST WEEK Reserve Bank officials
found a roll of film hidden by the $lO
note forgers a find which probably
means that no more of the fake notes
will be made but the bank’s $lO,OOO
reward question stands: where is the
cache from which counterfeits are still
being fed into the currency?
On offer for a month this week, and
still no takers, the reward is a general
one for information leading to the ar-
rest and conviction of currency forgers,
but what the authorities want to know
is the whereabouts and size of the
remaining stocks from the counterfeit
operation which kicked off among 1966
Christmas shoppers. Apart from
thousands of notes which were seized
in Melbourne before they could be put
into circulation, 3700 fakes have so
far come into banks or police hands in
Sydney or Melbourne! But someone,
somewhere, still has some duds. Is it a
few, or a lot? That’s the worry.
Bookies, a notoriously spry lot, have
been checking tenners against the light
for a long time, but the precautionary
look and feel for waxiness has become
more general since the newest scare
over discovery of “near perfect” $lO
forgeries in which the toughest security
barrier, the metal thread, was reported
to have been overcome. However, the
Secretary of the Reserve Bank, Mr. A.
C. McPherson, told the Bulletin this
week he was satisfied these were from
the “original stable,” although an at-
tempt had been made to put something
like a metal thread in them.
The fakes so far are few among the
genuine $lO note issue, now running at
something like $4OO million, but the
Federal authorities are concerned
enough to stepped up their adver-
tising warnings. They know a trickle
can become a stream, that paper money
is only as good as the confidence users
have in it. Otherwise, back to conch
shells.
Some people believe the authorities
are not worried enough, or in the right
direction. A Melbourne union has com-
plained about the “both-ways-a-loser”
attitude of the Reserve Bank to the
public in refusing compensation to
people who get bad notes, yet also ex-
pecting them to go to the trouble of
handing in forgeries.
In Sydney, the Building Workers’
Industrial Union asked the State
Government to require employers to
show serial numbers of $lO on em-
ployees’ pay packets so that workers,
unlucky enough to get a bad note
could easily prove it and make out a
stronger case for reimbursement. But
that approach came to nought. The
Premier, Mr. Askin, wasn’t anxious to
take up the play with a Federal hot
potato.
There is not the least likelihood that
the Reserve Bank will ever agree
to compensation for people who get
stuck with duds. “There is no note
issue in the world for which compen-
sation is paid,” said Mr. McPherson.
“Forgeries are nullities and you just
don’t pay on a nullity. Compensation
will encourage forgers. We have the
greatest sympathy with people who get
caught I know how I would feel if
I got a forgery but there are all
sorts of forged documents in a com-
munity which involve innocent people
in loss.”
Mr, McPherson scotched speculation
that the Australian counterfeit ring
has overseas affiliations. He said there
was no evidence of any international
link-up nor any significance in the
timing of the reward it would have
been offered much earlier had there
not been court proceedings pending.
What of the consistently circulating
stories that the $lO bill is much easier
to counterfeit that the old pound notes?
As is the custom in various countries
when a new note issue is made, Aus-
tralian decimal notes were circulated
among bank security and note-print-
ing experts all over the world. These
people like to keep ahead of forgers’
tricks by doing a bit of laboratory
forgery themselves and seeing how hard

it is. The reports which came back
were generally on the same lines: the
Australian notes were classified as
“difficult” to counterfeit.
On this point, designer of the deci-
mal notes, Mr. Gordon Andrews, of
Sydney, said: “With the advanced
technology we have in every direction,
the old pound notes could have been
forged much more easily today than
the dollar ones.”
To make things tougher for forgers
in Australia, a new unit of the Com-
monwealth Police Force attached to
the Note Printing Branch of the Re-
serve Bank in Melbourne is compiling
a register of all known suppliers of
printing and photographic equipment,
paper, and ink which counterfeiters
need, so that when duds come to light
quick checks can be made. The new
“Feds” are also being instructed in note
printing techniques and forgery tests.
But the authorities believe the public
is the best weapon against forgery. Mr.
Andrews said: “If people will take the
trouble to understand the clues, they
can pick the counterfeits easily.”
Young Socialists
New name, old face
THE YOUNG SOCIALIST League of
Australia, born in Sydney during Sep-
tember last year, has settled down suffi-
ciently to contemplate political action.
It has given itself a fair-sized field to
operate in as its constitution says that
the YSL will co-operate with all or-
ganisations, movements, individuals,
and groups which contribute: . to
the movement for youth rights, peace,
and socialism,” and particularly with
“The Communist Party of Australia,
which has the most consistent program
for achieving socialism.”
Students of Left-wing politics will
recognise these points as nearly a
straight lift from the platform of the
CPA’s youth organisation, the Eureka
Youth League. However, the EYL,
formed in 1942, is unlikely to protest
as it went into liquidation at its four-
teenth National Congress in September
last year “following two years of far-
reaching discussion.”
Nor will those who were members of
the EYL protest for, nearly to a man,
they have enrolled in the YSL. In fact,
the YSL is part of the new program,
“the coalition of the Left,” which the
CPA is trying to fashion as a means
of ultimately creating a mass Com-
munist Party.
During the 21st Congress of the CPA
in June of last year National Com-
mittee member Mr. M. Ogden delivered
a report, “The Party and the Younger
Generation,” in which he forecast the
demise of the EYL and the birth of a
new organisation, which, while being
Marxist, would not call for “an
allegiance to the Party as at present.”


MASONS &
CATHOLICS
A new understanding
By MICHAEL BAUME
IT WAS too much for the PMG’s new
mail-sorting machine: when Norman,
Cardinal Gilroy wrote a letter of in-
troduction to the Vatican for Most
Worshipful Brother E. A. Primrose,
Grand Master of the United Grand
Lodge of N.S.W., the machine chewed
it up. The Catholic Church and the
Masons had been battling it out ever
since the organisation was first con-
demned by Pope Clement XII 230
years ago. And here, without any
change in the “statutory” Catholic
approach to Freemasonry, was a revolu-
tionary development in friendly rela-
tiofis between old enemies.
It took more than the mail-sorting
machine to prevent the Pope inviting
the Grand Master to an audience;
Cardinal Gilroy’s letter eventually
reached the Vatican last June. Unfor-
tunately, the only time the Pope had
available for an audience clashed with
the departure time of the aircraft the
Grand Master had to catch in order to
take part in the Masonic celebrations
in London that were the reason for his
visit to Europe. So what would prob-
ably have been the first formal audi-
ence given for centuries by a Pope to
a leading Mason in his official role as
a Mason did not take place.
The ecumenical movement,
evidenced in Vatican 11, has not
formally included Freemasonry, and
excommunication remains the penalty
for Catholics who become Masons.
There has been no suggestion that the
hard anti-Masonic line, maintained by
eight successors of Clement, should be
softened. There does, however, seem
some prospect that the present thorough
revision of the Canon Law, by a com-
mittee of which Sydney’s Archbishop
Carroll is a member, could result in a
change of Canon 2335 which renders
subject to excommunication those who
give their name to the Masonic sect
or any other similar sect which “plots
against the Church or against legitimate
civil powers.”
There is a growing body of opinion
among influential Catholic churchmen
in Australia that the old hatreds are
unreal, that the Masons are no longer
a theological, political, and social
enemy to be fought with the bitterness
of 50 years ago.
Revising the present code of Canon
Law, which has been in force for the
past 50 years, will take years, although
the process could be shortened if the
revisions were released in sections.
While this law remains, excommunica-
tion is still the penalty, although
some local church lawyers wonder
whether it is likely to be enforced in
the present climate.
The absence of any official change in
the Church’s attitude so far and its
continuing to leave out-of-date tracts
as its only easily accessible statements
to the faithful on the Masons are more
likely to be because Freemasonry is
a “non-subject” at the present time,
when there are so many other more
important things to think about, than
because of any immovable opposition'
to the order. Now it is quite acceptable
for Catholics to co-operate closely with
Masons, and for Cardinals to write
letters of introductions for Grand
Masters.
It would be unreal to see the
Catholic-Masonic rapprochement as a
consequence simply of the new liberal-,
ism that many see as the basis of the
ecumenical movement. To a large ex-
tent, there is simple self-interest behind
it; both parties at last realise they
stand to gain by standing together, par-
ticularly in those areas where they are
dealing with the same problems
charity and social service. Both seem
to have a healthy respect for each
other’s skills in these areas, in which
many other organisations perform
badly.
The climate of friendship has been
largely created out of this common
ground. The necessity for a united
front in dealing with financial agencies
like Commonwealth and State Govern-
ments has been clearly demonstrated
in recent times. The N.S.W. Associa-
tion of Child Caring Agencies, set up
in 1958, was a practical first step in
ecumenism, with most religious organi-
sations gathering together in an inter-
denominational pressure group that has
paid off.
It was natural that the friendship
established around the conference table
should spread into other areas, and
that there should be a new willingness
by Catholic thinkers to re-examine
their attitudes to the Masons, and vice
versa.
The events that led up to the Grand
Master visiting the Vatican were re-
markably undramatic in themselves.
The Sisters of Mercy, who run the
Our Lady of Mercy Home, Waitara,
wanted a “respectable, responsible
maintenance man” to look after what
is a mixture of a home for 65 under-
privileged children, ranging from seven
days to nine years, and for 40 un-
married mothers, a mothercraft hos-
pital for eight mothers and babies, a
mothercraft training school for 30
student nurses, and a pre-school kinder-
garten.
They mentioned this to the local
plumber, a Mason, who recommended
a friend, Mr. Percy Lyon, a past master
of his lodge who had recently retired
and wanted something to do. Lyon told
them he was a Mason, but he still got
the job.
Soon after taking it and seeing what
the sisters were doing, he realised they
needed help. He raised the matter at
a lodge meeting attended by Sydney
timber merchant Eric Primrose, the
N.S.W. Grand Master, who took it up
with Len Bradbury, president of the
County Council Combined Masonic
Association.
Bradbury and his fellow Masons
from the County Council spent a day
rewiring one of the home’s buildings;
they spent another installing a new
power system to cope with new equip-
ment for the hospital; another putting
in electric clocks; another, in conjunc-
tion with the AWA Masonic Associa-
tion, installing a public-address system.
This has now developed into a system
of regular inspections by Bradbury to
see what needs to be done, followed by
a Saturday work-day.
One of the sights of Waitara on
occasional Saturdays is a group of


Worshipful Brother Percy Lyon,
maintenance man at the Our Lady of
Mercy Home, Waitara, N.S.W.,
with its administrator, Sister Borromeo
sweaty Masons being served with beer
and cake by Sisters of Mercy.
One of these working parties was on
the day the children were taken for
a fortnight’s holiday by volunteer
families. The arrangements for one
little boy had broken down; at 7 p.m.
he was still hoping that his “family”
would turn up to give him a holiday
after most of his mates had gone off in
the morning. One of the Masons took
him home instead.
There has been no question of the
Church’s appreciation. Bishop Muldoon,
regarded by most Catholics as being
very far removed from the front ranks
of liberal thought in the Church, has
publicly praised the work of the Masons
at Waitara and welcomed the friendly
associations that have developed.
Friendship is spreading. In Lithgow
and Wollongong, Masons are active
collectors for the St. Vincent de Paul
Society; in Killara a lodge has fur-
nished a rescue centre.
When the Grand Master was at the
Waitara home on one of the work-days,
he mentioned to Mother Canisius, its.
superior, that on a visit to Britain
he was stopping over iri Rome for a day
and would very much like to see the
Vatican, and, if possible, the Pope.
Mother Canisius, who frankly did
not like his chances, told Monsignor
McCosker, of the National Catholic
Welfare Committee, about Mr. Prim-
rose’s trip and he arranged things with
the Cardinal.
The Grand Master and the Grand
Secretary and their wives were given
a private, conducted tour of the Vatican
and were greeted officially by Dr.
Doherty, of the Urban College of
Propaganda Fide, as the Grand Master
and Grand Secretary of Freemasons in
N.S.W. Then came the invitation to an
audience with the Pope which they
were unable to accept. “I was very
disappointed indeed that I could not
meet His Holiness. It would have been
a historic meeting,” Mr. Primrose
says.
For all the closeness and under-
standing that have emerged between
Masons and Catholics through their
charitable activities, there are still
serious theological problems keeping
them apart.
These tend to be minimised by the
Masons, who maintain they have no
prejudice against or objections to
Catholics, who are free to join if they
wish.
The Grand Master says: “I have a
strong feeling that before long there
will be greater co-operation between
the craft and the Church. Separating
us there is merely a different way of
worshipping the same God. As far as
the craft is concerned, it is glad to
help any deserving cause; its charity
is by no means confined to fellow
Masons. But we are also glad of the
ecumenical nature of this work at
Waitara. I am delighted at the response
of our Catholic friends. I’m stire the
things we’ve thought about each other
all our lives have been imaginary.”
Some Catholics also seek to reduce
the gap between the two old-established
warriors. “Since there is so much dis-
belief, anything theistic is to be encour-
aged,” according to one senior Sydney
Catholic churchman. But he still had
his reservations about Freemasonry on


theological grounds, complaining that
Masons must swear a blank cheque not
to reveal anything, even if it broke a
Commandment and should be men-
tioned by a Catholic in the con-
fessional.
The chief Catholic objections to
Freemasonry, as stated in the only
pamphlet on the subject currently on
sale in St. Mary’s Cathedral, Sydney,
are the pure naturalism of its teach-
ings, its secret and open plotting
against the Church and certain govern-
ments, and the proximate danger of
loss of faith to Catholics who join it.
“Many Masons are honestly unaware
The Grand Master of the United
Grand Lodge of N.S.W., Most Worship-
ful Brother E. A. Primrose (centre), at
the Our Lady of Mercy babies’ home
with Worshipful Brother Lyon, Sister
Borromeo, and young friends
that their order is opposed to the
Catholic faith,” says the pamphlet.
“One can become a full-fledged brother
by taking the first three degrees and
in none of them is there the least hint
of anti-Catholicism or irreligion. There
is much talk of fraternity and charity—
to which any Catholic could subscribe.
But Catholic members and even non-
members who would not be
in sympathy with the lessons taught
in the higher degrees would never have
an opportunity of being initiated into
them. Those who are admitted to the
last few degrees are hand picked.” The
pamphlet does not produce any evi-
dence of the “anti-Catholic nature” of
the secrets of the higher degrees.
If this view does not have great influ-
ence among Church thinkers, there
does seem some support for the view of
Monsignor Mcßeavy that it is Masonic
secrecy preventing the Church from
exercising her legitimate function of
vigilance to which the Church new rests
the bulk of its objection to Freemasonry
rather than any “subversive plotting.”
But there are still strong Catholic objec-
tions to the “naturalistic philosophy”
of the Masons and their “consequential
indifferentism in regard to religious
creeds.”
The Mason’s “indifferentism” in re-
gard to religious creeds has been justi-
fied strongly in a definitive statement
by the English Grand Lodge on Free-
masonry’s relations with organised re-
ligion. “It cannot be too strongly assert-
ed that Masonry is neither a religion
nor a substitute for religion. Masonry
seeks to inculcate in its members a
standard of conduct and behaviour
which it believes to be acceptable to all
creeds, but studiously refrains from in-
tervening in the field of dogma or
theology.
“The stress laid on the Mason’s duty
toward a supreme being should be suffi-
cient evidence to all but the wilfully
prejudiced that Masonry is an upholder
of religion, since it both requires a man
to have some form of religious belief
before he can join and to go on prac-
tising it.”
Some churchmen are prepared to
accept this. They recognise that most
of the ridiculous words Masons use in
their ceremonies and their blood-
curdling oaths are only symbolic (as is
so much of the Bible), and that the
lack of a Christ figure in the lodge
ritual, which refers only to the Great
Architect of the Universe, does not
imply an anti-Christ attitude, but
simply allows Christians and Jews to
come under its “brotherhood of man
and fatherhood of God” umbrella.
It requires no great theological
agility for the leading Protestant
churchmen who are Masons to apply
their Holy Trinity concept to the one
God the Masons pray to. This presents
no insuperable theological hurdle to
many Catholics, either.
The current “official” Catholic pam-
phlet, which appears to be at least ten
years old, does not appear to reflect
present-day attitudes toward Masonry.
But it is, nevertheless, much more sens-
ible than the efforts of 40 years ago
which talked of “the formal worship
of Satan” and how “Satan physically
co-operated in Masonic activity” and
how it was related to “Phallic worship
and Bacchic rites.”
In any event, much of the formal
Catholic objection to Freemasonry (par-
ticularly in the “Catholics and the
Masons” pamphlet) seems aimed at one
of the French orders (which is not
recognised by the British or Scottish
bodies, under whose jurisdiction Aus-
tralian lodges operate) rather than at
the local version.
Some of the Catholic churchmen
here who believe this attitude to be
out of date consider the main object-
ion to Freemasonry to be social rather
than theological—the few remaining
instances of job preference.
(But they stress their violent opposi-
tion to the French Grand Orient Lodge,
which is still clearly anti-clerical, even
if its anti-clericalism is mainly politi-
cal.)
In Australia there are few instances
in which the political aims of Catholics
and Masons would be automatically
opposed to such a degree as to justify
the traditional dislike that is perpetu-
ated in several countries of Europe,
where the Church’s role in politics
means that Masonic anti-clericalism is
almost inevitable.
State aid to church schools is an
issue that could have brought out such
a dispute, but Masonic objections
appear to have been neither significant
nor particularly effective; Masons have
certainly been no rallying point.
In Australia, the basic Catholic com-
plaint about Masons seems to have
rested more on the solidly realistic
point that Masons looked after them-
selves in employment and discriminated
against Catholics. This was true, and
not so very long ago. But there are
very few companies in Australia these
days where this sort of thing goes on;
the demands of modern-day business
life make it unlikely that companies
could afford to drive away talented
Catholics to promote incompetent
Masons. The only time this sort of
preference may still go on is when
everything else is equal.
This may be no more prevalent than
employers having a prejudice in favor
of boys from their old school, and that
sort of thing.
The times are long gone since a
Catholic had to join the Public Ser-
vice in order to get a job; even the
Presbyterian bastions of the CSR have
long since been successfully stormed
by able Catholics.
It could be, of course, that the end
of this sort of preference on a large
scale may be one of the reasons the
Masons are having difficulties keeping
their numbers up. Like the churches,
the Masons are faced with a serious
membership problem, with an unduly
large proportion of older members.
This could be another factor draw-
ing the Catholics and the Masons close
together; far more people than ever
before are not members of either body.
Both are looking for ways to hold their
position in a society that considers it
has less need of them; the assault on
both of them of popular indifference
has drawn them into some sort of
common bond, just as it has with the
Protestant churches.
It is not so many centuries ago that
there were Popes who were Masons,
according to the Masons. The period of
greatest antipathy between the two
groups has now well and truly passed.
Who knows but that members of the
Catholic version of Freemasonry, the
Knights of the Sbuthern Cross, may
soon discover there is very little
separating themselves from the organi-
sation they were set up to counter. But
no one is yet prepared to predict what
century will see the next Masonic Pope.


KEEPING THE WORLD'S MONEY ON THE MOVE
By the FINANCIAL EDITOR
A MAJOR CRISIS in the world
monetary system may be exactly what
is needed right now. A crisis may be
the only way to force some sort of
sensible solution to the worsening prob-
lem of how to keep up a big enough
flow of money so that countries can
buy and sell things to each other.
Otherwise, if the money doesn’t keep
up, nations will reduce their buying and
selling.
The devaluation of the pound sterl-
ing and President Johnson’s measures
to protect the dollar are just stop-
gaps. They do not get to the heart of
the problem of providing enough
money for trade to go on rising. And
if that problem is not quickly solved,
there could be a world recession.
It takes increasing cash to pay for
increasing world trade. It doesn’t mat-
ter what the cash is, provided it is
accepted with confidence by the sellers
of goods. The three units of cash in
universal Use this century have been
gold, dollars, and sterling. But there
is not nearly enough gold to go
around; confidence in the dollar is
wobbling; and sterling has suffered a
fate worse than death. In any event,
the supply of all three together is
rising at a far slower rate than world
trade; last year, for instance, world
exports increased by 5J percent, but
the amount of cash in the foreign
reserves of all the world’s countries
rose by only 2 percent. This rise was
only as big as 2 percent because the
continuing deficits of Britain and the
United States added to the amount of
dollars and sterling that other coun-
tries held.
The amount of gold available for
world trading is actually falling. Pro-
duction is not keeping up with demand
and industrial uses and speculative
hoarding continue to increase. The
latest figures show that in 1966 there
was a fall in gold used as monetary
reserves because industrial use and
hoarding took SU.S.9O million more
than the new gold mined.
Now that Britain and the U.S. are
trying so hard to end the flow of their
currencies into foreign hands, it will
mean that the amount of cash available
to the rest of the Western world for
international trading will rise by even
less this year. This would eventually
restrict the amount of world trading
that these countries would be able to
finance. - And a slackening in world
trade would lead to a world recession.
In addition, the complete banning
of U.S. investment in Europe under
the Johnson plan (which is to be chal-
lenged by some U.S. interests) will
mean a shortage of capital and a
continued rise in world interest rates,
which are already high. This, too, will
have a bad effect on trade, making it
more expensive for countries to do
business with each other and possibly
discouraging some of the economic
expansion that would otherwise have
taken place.
Why, then, should the Americans
become so tough about stopping their
deficits? There is no doubt that the
Americans do not want a world trad-
ing recession. This is why the U.S.
restraints are not aimed at trade at
all: there are no added tariffs or new
import quotas aimed at reducing their
imports at the expense of the rest of
the world’s export earnings. The action
they have taken is probably the kindest
way of halting the outflow of dollars.
It simply dramatises the need for a
real solution to the world liquidity
problem.
It does not really mean that the
United States is going broke; on the
contrary, most commentators expect
the U.S. economy to boom along quite
well in 1968. The tough Johnson
measures to protect the dollar are
something quite apart from the basic
economic position of the U.S. They are
not the result of any failure of Ameri-
can exports to pay for imports, which
was the basic problem of sterling. In
fact, U.S. exports are about 10 per-
cent higher than imports. (Nevertheless,
the U.S. now wants them to be $5OO
million or so higher still.)
The problem is that America’s
foreign spending on defence, aid, and
investments has in itself been almost as
large as its import bill in recent years,
so that to meet its cost, the U.S. has
had to run almost a decade of deficits,
running down its reserves of foreign
currencies and holdings of gold.
It has run down its gold stock so
far that now there simply is not
enough to meet the demands for gold
that foreign governments who hold
dollars are entitled to make. At present
these foreign governments (except
France) have agreed not to press their
entitlements to convert their dollars
into gold. In doing this they have
attempted to help the U.S. govern-
ment out of its problem. But they have
also demanded that the U.S. do some-
thing to stop these deficits on its bal-
ance of payments. The restraints on
foreign investment, on foreign travel,
and on foreign defence expenditure
announced on January 1 are intended
to do this. And the one-third reduc-
tion by Congress of the President’s
foreign aid program will also save
SU.S. 1000-million.
In any event, the previous U.S.
restrictions on foreign investment that
the latest ones replace had already
begun to bite pretty hard; even
though Australia never had it so good
on the U.S. capital inflow front as it
has during the past two years, other
countries had certainly begun to feel
the pinch. But these previous restric-
tions, which were based on requests
rather than legislation, have saved
only pin-money compared with the
massive outflow of foreign-held dollars
into gold as speculators (particularly
in Europe) have feared that the dollar
is due to follow sterling by devaluing.
In the month following sterling’s
devaluation, speculators bought gold
equal to more than half the Western
world’s production for a full year,
most of it for dollars.
The latest U.S. measures, by show-
ing the lengths to which the Adminis-
tration will go to avoid a dollar
devaluation (which means a rise in
the price of gold), is aimed at stop-
ping this speculative drain on the
world’s gold stocks, and particularly
on the dwindling pile in Fort Knox.
The French had long been stress-
ing the need for something like this
action against U.S. foreign investment.
The de Gaulle approach has been that
the only reason the U.S. has been able
to take over so many European com-
panies and to increase its hold over
European industry so significantly in
recent years has been that Americans
have been allowed by the rest of the
world to use a huge deficit on foreign
account to do so. The French say
that it is only because the dollar is
used by so many trading countries in
buying and selling goods that everyone
has avoided taking action against the
Americans for continually running bal-
ance of payments deficits; so the
Americans have been able to benefit
from the fact that the dollar is a unit
of international exchange. That, say the
French, is quite unfair.
So the French objection to most of
the plans for increasing the world’s
supply of money has been along the
lines that these plans would not only
allow economies like Britain’s, that
were in fundamental disequilibrium,
to carry on longer without having to
put their house in order, but also
that they would enable countries like
the U.S., that were in deficit, to con-
tinue to make foreign takeovers and
even to make them more easily be-
cause of the volume of dollars avail-
able in Europe.
The fact that France itself stands
to gain financially by forcing a devalu-
ation of the dollar (all the stocks of


gold she has been building up in recen
years would then be worth more dol
lars) is really a side issue. Attractive
as it may be to British and American
critics of the French to see this as
cunning Gaullist plot to make a kill
ing out of France’s big gold holdings
it seems the French have much more
serious questions in mind.
For it is incontestable that an in
crease in the price of gold woulc
improve things for a while. Thi
would give a sudden increase to the
value of all the gold held by countrie
around the world and, therefore, to
their reserves of currency available for
foreign trade.
There can be no questioning that any
rise from the current price of $U.5.35
an ounce that has ruled since before
World War II would encourage much
more mining of gold, so the world’s
supply of money would increase. But
is this the real answer? In this day anc
age is it sensible to spend a lot ol
effort digging metal out of the ground,
refining it, making it into bars, and
then digging another big hole in the
ground and locking it away there to
prove that you are rich?
What, then, can the world do about
this problem? It is really a matter of
devising some method of bookkeeping
in which all the world has confidence;
developing a sort of paper gold that is
as universally acceptable as the real
thing and the supply of which will
increase in line with demand. This
does not mean that it should rise as
fast as world trade; that is not necessary
and would probably be inflationary, as
the French were keen to point out
when objecting to Professor Triffin’s
plans for increasing the amount of
international liquidity by using a
mathematical formula.
But there is clearly a need for work-
ing out how the flow of available money
should increase without rising in a way
that would enable countries to continue
on wrong economic courses when they
should really be forced to mend their
ways. What excites the French is that
most of the systems devised so far have
not had any satisfactory protection
(according to the French) against the
risk of countries not playing the game.
This is what happened when Britain
tried to avoid devaluing for years when
it was clear that her money was over-
valued in world markets and was arti-
ficially sustained. British importers were
able to buy more goods than the pound
was really worth.
Last year the first tentative steps
toward creating a new paper gold were
agreed on at the World Bank meeting
at Rio de Janeiro. There, the 107
members of the International Monetary
Fund adopted a proposal setting up
special drawing rights. These allow
countries to trade more, to keep spend-
ing money on foreign goods, and run-
ning down their reserves for foreign
currency by considerably more before
pressing the panic button and taking
action to stop demand for imports.
For, in the modern world, the level
Above, graph showing monetary reserves
held by governments and central banks
of the Western world. Below, what these
reserves are held in
of internal demand in a country
that spills over into demand for imports
can no longer be regulated by import
controls and licensing as of old; the
Gatt and other international trading
agreements have seen to that. Nowadays,
it means restraining the rate of growth
of the economy in question; clamping
down on demand in general to limit
demand for imports. So it is vital that
trading nations should have a fair
amount of leeway, a decent bit of scope
in these reserves so that there could
be pretty sizable moves before a
country had to take action to alter its
internal rate of growth or its level of
prosperity.
These new special drawing rights,
which are to be allotted automatically
to a country in need, are aimed at in-
creasing that scope, but only a little.
They are important more for the
principle they represent than for the
degree of relief they give to the world
liquidity shortage.
The new drawing rights will work
this way: nations will pay their own
currency into a special account at the
International Monetary Fund, and this
will entitle them to draw out an
equivalent amount in other currencies
to settle any international debts. This
entitlement is to be regarded as a part
of a country’s international reserves; it
will be just as real in international
terms as gold. Governments will be able
to use this drawing right automatic-
ally without getting IMF approval in
order to provide the funds used by
their nationals in international trad-
ing.
That is why it is so different from
the basic “drawing rights” that have
previously existed (and still do) in
the IMF, by which a country in need
can normally borrow up to 125 per-
cent of the cash it has subscribed to
the Fund. Small borrowings (up to a
quarter of the subscription it makes in
its own currency) in other currencies
can be made almost automatically.
But larger drawings involve submit-
ting the borrowing country’s economic
policies to examination and approval
by the Fund.
So if the IMF thinks a country is
doing the wrong thing it can refuse to
allow it to borrow more until it
changes its policies, for example, by
devaluing its currency. (By the way,
one consequence of belonging to the
IMF is that any country wanting to
devalue must get IMF approval and
must be in “basic disequilibrium,”
which is one reason many commentators
thought Australia could not have de-
valued following sterling’s lead even if
we had wanted to.)
But there are disagreements between
IMF members about the sharpness of
the teeth needed by the IMF itself in
its role of watchdog. If IMF credits
were ever to become a credible sub-
stitute for gold on a large scale, every
member would have to feel confident in
the IMF’s ability to act tough; to draw
the line needed to protect such a sys-
tem from abuse. And since this would
depend on international co-operation,
many people are sure it could never
work.
In any event, the IMF has gone part
of the way to easing the problem of
shortage of money for international
trade; it has provided about SU.S. 13
billion in drawings since 1946 and
about SU.S. 4£ billion is currently out-
standing, with another SU.S. half bil-
lion in standing arrangements for auto-
matic loans. But, as the graph shows,
this is only a relatively small part of
world reserves of SU.S. 72 billion.
There is a long way to go before the
IMF becomes an adequate instrument
for providing enough money for world
trade.
The British crisis, the American crisis
- and now the prospect of a European
crisis if their balance of payments be-
gin to suffer should be driving home -
to the world’s economic leaders the
urgent need for fundamental changes
in the whole international monetary
system. It needs more than patchwork
repairs to keep it going.


REPORT
FROM IRON MOUNTAIN
This, the concluding instalment from the book “Report from Iron Mountain on the Possibility
and Desirability of Peace,” discusses substitutes for the functions of war.
BY NOW it should be clear that the
most comprehensive master plan for
a transition to world peace will remain
academic if it fails to deal forthrightly
with the problem of the critical non-
military functions of war. The social
needs they serve are essential; if the
war system no longer exists to meet
them, subsititute institutions will have
to be established for the purpose.
lie on o in ic
Economic surrogates for war must
meet two principal criteria. They must
be "wasteful," in the common sense
of the word, and they must operate
outside the normal supply-demand sys-
tem. A corollary that should be obvious
is that the magnitude of the waste must
be sufficient to meet the needs of a
particular society. An economy as ad-
vanced and complex as our own re-
quires the planned average annual
destruction of not less than ten percent
of gross national product if it is effec-
tively to fulfil its stabilising function.
When the mass of a balance wheel is
inadequate to the power it is intended
to control, its effect can be self-defeat-
ing. as with a runaway locomotive. The
analogy, though crude, is especially apt
for the American economy, as our
record of cyclical depressions shows.
All have taken place during periods of
grossly inadequate military spending.
An economic surrogate that has
been proposed is a series of giant
“space-research” programs. What has
been implied, although not yet ex-
pressly put forth, is the development
of a long-range sequence of space-
research projects with largely unattain-
able goals. This kind of program offers
several advantages lacking in the
social-welfare model. First, it is un-
likely to phase itself out, regardless of
the predictable “surprises” science has
in store for us: the universe is too big.
In the event some individual project
unexpectedly succeeds there would be
no dearth of substitute problems. For
example, if colonisation of the moon
proceeds on schedule, it could then
become “necessary” to establish a
beachhead on Mars or Jupiter, and so
on. Second, it need be no more de-
pendent on the general supply-demand
economy than its military prototype.
Third, it lends itself extraordinarily
well to arbitrary control.
Space research can be viewed as the
nearest modern equivalent yet devised
to the pyramid building and similar
ritualistic enterprises of ancient
societies. It is true that the scientific
value of the space program, even of
whal has already been accomplished, is
substantial on its own terms. But
current programs arc absurdly and
obviously disproportionate in the rela-
tionship of the knowledge sought to the
expenditures committed. All but a small
fraction of the space budget, measured
by the standards of comparable scien-
tific objectives, must be charged lie
facto to the military economy. Future
space research, projected as a war
surrogate, would further reduce the
"scientific” rationale of its budget to a
minuscule percentage indeed. As a
purely economic substitute for war,
therefore, extension of the space pro-
gram warrants serious consideration.
Then there is the proposal to
establish the "Unarmed Forces” of the
United States. This would conveniently
maintain the entire institutional military
structure, redirecting it essentially to-
ward social-welfare activities on a global
scale. It would be, in effect, a giant
military Peace Corps. TheTe is nothing
inherently unworkable about this plan,
and using the existing military system
to effectuate its own demise is both in-
genious and convenient. But even on a
greatly magnified world basis, social-
welfare expenditures must sooner or
later re-enter the atmosphere of the
normal economy. The practical transi-
tional virtues of such a scheme would
thus be eventually negated by its in-
adequacy as a permanent economic
stabiliser.
Political
The end of war means the end of
national sovereignty, and thus the end
of nationhood as we know it today.
But this does not necessarily mean the
end of nations in the administrative
sense, and internal political power will
remain essential to a stable society.
The emerging "nations” of the peace
epoch must continue to draw political
authority from some source.
A number of proposals have been
made governing the relations between
nations after total disarmament; all are
basically juridical in nature. They con-
template institutions more or less like
a World Court, or a United Nations,
but vested with real authority. They
may or may not serve their ostensible
post-military purpose of settling inter-
national disputes, but we need not dis-
cuss that here. None would offer effec-
tive external pressure on a peace-world
nation to organise itself politically.
It might be argued that a well-armed
international police force, operating
under the authority of such a supra-
national “court,” could well serve the
function of external enemy. This, how-
ever, would constitute a military opera-
tion, like the inspection schemes men-
tioned. and, like them, would be incon-
sistent with the premise of an end to
the war system. It is possible that a
variant of the "Unarmed Forces” idea
mi,t>ht be developed in such a way that
its "constructive” (i.e., social welfare)
activities, could be combined with an
economic "threat” of sufficient size to
warrant political organisation. We are
sceptical of its capacity to evoke credi-
bility.
Credibility,’in fact, lies at the heart
of the problem of developing a politi-
cal substitute for war. This is where
the space-race proposals, in many ways
so well suited as economic substitutes
for war, fall short. The most ambitious
and unrealistic space project cannot
of i/tself generate a believable external
menace. It has been hotly argued that
such a menace would offer the "last,
best hope of peace,” etc., by uniting
mankind against the danger of destruc-
tion by "creatures” from other planets
or from outer space. Experiments have
been proposed to test the .credibility
of an out-of-our-world invasion threat;
it is possible that a few of the more
diffieult-to-explain ‘‘flying-saucer” inci-
dents of recent years were, in fact, early
experiments of this kind. If so, they
could hardly have been judged
encouraging.
Nevertheless, an effective political
substitute for war would require
‘‘alternate enemies,” some of which
might seem equally farfetched in the
context of the current war system. It
may be, for instance, that gross pollu-
tion of the environment can eventually
replace the possibility of mass destruc-
tion by nuclear weapons as the prin-
cipal apparent threat to the survival
of the. species. Poisoning of the air,
and of the principal sources of food
and water supply, is already well
advanced, and at first glance -would
seem promising in this respect; it con-
stitutes a threat that can be dealt with
only through social organisation and
political power.
It is true that the rate of pollution
could be increased selectively for this
purpose; in fact, the mere modifying
of existing programs for the deterrence
of pollution could speed up the process
enough to make the threat credible.
But the pollution problem has been
so widely publicised in recent years
that it seems highly improbable that
a program of deliberate environmental
poisoning could be implemented in a
politically acceptable manner.
However unlikely some of the pos-


sible alternate enemies we have men-
tioned may seem, we must emphasise
that one must be found, of credible
quality and magnitude, if a transition
to peace is ever to come about without
social disintegration. It is more prob-
able, in our judgment, that such a
threat will have to be invented, rather
than developed, from unknown condi-
tions. For this reason, we believe further
speculation about its putative nature
ill-advised in this context. Since there
is considerable doubt, in our minds,
that any viable political surrogate can
be devised, we are reluctant to com-
promise, by premature discussion, any
■possible option that may eventually lie
open to our Government.
Sociological
Of the many functions of war we
have found convenient to group to-
gether in this classification, two are
critical. In a world of peace, the con-
tinuing stability of society will require:
(1) an effective substitute for military
institutions that can neutralise de-
stabilising social elements, and (2) a
credible motivational surrogate for war
that can ensure social cohesiveness.
Most proposals that address them-
selves, explicitly or otherwise, to the
postwar problem of controlling the
socially alienated turn to some variant
of the Peace Corps or the so-called Job
Corps for a solution. The socially dis-
affected, the economically unprepared,
the psychologically unconformable, the
hard-core “delinquents,” the incorrig-
ible “subversives,” and the rest of the
unemployable are seen as somehow
transformed by the disciplines of a
service modelled on military precedent
into more or less dedicated social
workers. This presumption also informs
the otherwise hard-headed ratiocination
of the “Unartned Forces” plan.
The problem has been addressed, in
the language of popular sociology, by
Secretary McNamara. “Even in our
own abundant societies we have reason
enough to worry over the tensions that
coil and tighten among underprivileged
young people, and finally flail out in
delinquency and crime. What are we
to expect . . . where mounting frustra-
tions are likely to fester into eruptions
of violence and extremism?” In a
seemingly unrelated passage, he con-
tinues: “It seems to me that we could
move toward remedying that inequity
[of the Selective Service System] by
asking every young person in the
United States to give two years of ser-
vice to his country whether in one
of the military services, in the Peace
Corps, or in some other volunteer de-
velopmental work at home or abroad.
We could encourage other countries to
do the same.” Here, as elsewhere
throughout this significant speech, Mr.
McNamara has focused, indirectly but
unmistakably, on one of the key issues
bearing on a possible transition to
peace, and has later indicated, also
indirectly, a rough approach to its
resolution, again phrased in the langu-
age of the current war system.
It seems clear that Mr. McNamara
proponents of the peace-corps
surrogate for this war function lean
heavily on the success of the para-
military depression programs mention-
ed previously. We find the precedent
wholly inadequate in degree. Neither
the lack of relevant precedent, how-
ever, nor the dubious social welfare
sentimentality characterising this ap-
proach warrant its rejection without
careful study.
Another possible surrogate for the
control of potential enemies of society
is the reintroduction, in some form
consistent with modern technology and
political processes, of slavery. The tra-
ditional association of slavery with
ancient pre-industrial cultures should
not blind us to its adaptability to ad-
vanced forms of social organisation,
nor should its equally traditional in-
compatability with Western moral and
economic values. As a practical matter,
conversion of the code of military dis-
cipline to a euphemised form of en-
slavement would entail surprisingly
little revision; the logical first step
would be the adoption of some form
of “universal” military service.
Like its political function, the moti-
vational function of war requires the
existence of a genuinely menacing social
enemy. The principle difference is
that for purposes of motivating basic
allegiance, as distinct from accepting
political authority, the “alternate
enemy” must imply a more immediate,
tangible, and directly felt threat of
destruction. It must justify the need
for taking and paying a “blood price”
in wide areas of human concern.
Games theorists have suggested, in
other contexts, the development of
“blood games” for the effective con-
trol of individual aggressive impulses.
More realistically, such a ritual might
be socialised, in the manner of the
Spanish Inquisition and the less formal
witch trials of other periods, for pur-
poses of “social purification,” “State
security,” or other rationale both
acceptable and credible to post-war
societies. The feasibility of such an up-
dated version of still another ancient
institution, though doubtful, is consider-
ably less fanciful than the wishful
notion of many peace planners that a
lasting condition of peace can be
brought about without the most pains-
taking examination of every possible
surrogate for the essential functions of
war. What is involved here, in a sense,
is the quest for William James’ “moral
equivalent of war.”
It is also possible that the two func-
tions considered under this heading may
be jointly served, in the sense of estab-
lishing the antisocial, for whom a con-
trol institution is needed, as the “alter-
nate enemy” needed to hold society
together. The relentless and irreversible
advance of unemployability at all levels
of society may make some such program
necessary even as an adjunct to the war
system. As before, we will not speculate
on the specific forms this kind of pro-
gram might take except to note that
there is again ample precedent, in the
treatment meted out to disfavored,
allegedly menacing, ethnic groups in
certain societies, during certain historical
periods.
Ecological
Considering the shortcomings of war
as a mechanism of selective population
control, it might appear that devising
substitutes for this function should be
comparatively simple. Schematically this
is so, but the problem cjf timing the
transition to a new ecological balancing
device makes the feasibility of substitu-
tion less certain.
It must be remembered that the limi-
tation of war in this function is entirely
eugenic. War has not been genetically
progressive. But as a system of gross
population control to preserve the
species, it cannot fairly be faulted. And
current trends in warfare—the increased
strategic bombing of civilians and the
greater military importance now
attached to the destruction of sources
of supply—strongly suggest that a truly
qualitative improvement is in the mak-
ing. Assuming the war system is to con-
tinue, it is most probable the regressively
selective quality of war will have been
reversed.
There is no question but that a uni-
versal requirement that procreation be
limited to the products of artificial in-
semination would provide a fully ade-
quate substitute control for population
levels. It's predictable further develop-
ment conception and embryonic
growth taking place wholly under lab-
oratory conditions would extend
these controls to their logical conclusion.
The indicated intermediate step
total control of conception with a vari-
ant of the übiquitous “pill,” via water
supplies or certain essential foodstuffs,
offset by a controlled “antidote” is
already under development. There
would appear to be no foreseeable need
to revert to any of the outmoded prac-
tices referred to previously (infant-
icide, etc.) as there might have been if
the possibility of transition to peav.e
had arisen two generations ago.
The real question here, therefore,
does not concern the viability of this
war substitute but the political prob-
lems involved in bringing it about. It
cannot be established while the war
system is still in effect. The reason for
this is simple: excess population is war
material. As long as any society must
contemplate even a remote possibility
of war, it must maintain a maximum
supportable population, even when so
doing critically aggravates an eco-
nomic liability. This is paradoxical,
in view of war’s role in reducing ex-
cess population, but it is readily un-
derstood. War controls the general
population level, but the ecological in-
terest at any single society lies in
maintaining its hegemony vis-a-vis
other societies. The obvious analogy
can be seen in any free-enterprise
economy. Practices damaging to the


society as a whole both competitive
and monopolistic are abetted by the
conflicting economic motives of indi-
vidual capital interests. The obvious
precedent can be' found in the seeming-
ly irrational political difficulties which
have blocked universal adoptions of
simple birth-control methods. Nations
desperately in need of increasing un-
favorable production - consumption
ratios are nevertheless unwilling to
gamble their possible military require-
ments of 20 years hence. for this pur-
pose. Unilateral population control, as
practised in ancient Japan and in other
isolated societies, is out of the question
in today’s world.
Cultural and Scientific
The absolute need for substitute cul-
tural value-determinants and for the
continued advance of scientific know-
ledge is not established. We believe it
important, however, on behalf of those
for whom these functions hold sub-
jective significance, that it be known
what they can reasonably expect in
culture and science after a transition
to peace.
What may be expected to happen is
that art would be reassigned the role
it once played in a few primitive peace-
oriented social systems. This was the
function of pure decoration, entertain-
ment, or play, entirely free of the
burden of expressing the sociomoral
values and conflicts of a war-oriented
society. It is interesting that the ground-
work for such a value-free aesthetic is
already being laid today, in growing
experimentation in art without content,
perhaps in anticipation of a world with-
out conflict. A cult has developed
around a new kind of cultural deter-
minism, which proposes that the tech-
nological form of a cultural expression
determines its values rather than does
its ostensibly meaningful content; it
denies to art the relevance of sequen-
tial logic. Its significance in this con-
text is that it provides a working
model of one kind of value-free culture
we might reasonably anticipate in a
world at peace.
It might appear at first glance that
a giant space-research program, the
most promising among the proposed
economic surrogates for war, might
also serve as the basic stimulator of
scientific research. The lack of funda-
mental organised social conflict in-
herent in space work, however, would
rule it out as an adequate motivational
substitute for war when applied to
“pure” science. But it could no doubt
sustain the broad range of techno-
logical activity that a space budget
of military dimensions would require.
A similarly scaled social-welfare pro-
gram could provide a comparable
impetus to low-keyed technological
advances, especially in medicine,
rationalised construction methods,
educational psychology, etc. The
eugenic substitute for the ecological
function of war would also require
continuing research in certain areas of
the life sciences.
Apart from these partial substitutes
for war, it must be kept in mind that
the momentum given to scientific pro-
gress by the great wars of the past
century, and even more by the anticipa-
tion of World War 111, is intellectually
and materially enormous. It is our
finding that if the war system were to
end tomorrow this momentum is so
great that the pursuit of scientific
knowledge could reasonably be expec-
ted to go forward without noticeable
diminution for perhaps two decades.
It would then continue, at a progres-
sively decreasing tempo, for at least
another two decades before the “bank
account” of today’s unresolved prob-
lems would become exhausted.
This leads unavoidably to another
matter: the intrinsic value of the un-
limited search for knowledge. We, of
course, offer no independent value
judgments here, but it is germane to
point out that a substantial minority
of scientific opinion feels that search
to be circumscribed in any case.
For the record, we must also take
note of the precedent that during long
periods of human history, often cover-
ing thousands of years, in which no
social value was assigned to scientific
progress, stable societies did survive
and flourish.
CONCLUSIONS
It is apparent that no program or
combination of programs yet proposed
for a transition to peace has remotely
approached meeting the comprehensive
functional requirements of a world
without war. Although one projected
system for filling the economic func-
tion of war seems promising, similar
optimism cannot be expressed in the
equally essential political and socio-
logical areas. The other major non-
military functions of war—ecological,
cultural, scientific raise very dif-
ferent problems, but it is at least pos-
sible that detailed programming of
substitutes in these areas is not pre-
requisite to transition. More important,
it is not enough to develop adequate
but separate surrogates for the major
war functions; they must be fully com-
patible and in no degree self-cancelling.
Until such a unified program is de-
veloped, at least hypothetically, it is
impossible for this or any other group
to furnish meaningful answers to the
questions originally presented to us.
When asked how best to prepare for
the advent of peace, we must first
reply, as strongly as we can, that the
war system cannot responsibly be
allowed to disappear until (1) we know
exactly what it is we plan to put in
its place, and (2) we are certain,
beyond reasonable doubt, that these
substitute institutions will serve their
purposes in terms of the survival and
stability of society.
Such solutions, if indeed they exist,
will not be arrived at without a revo-
lutionary revision of the modes of
thought heretofore considered appro-
priate 'to peace research. That we
have examined the fundamental ques-
tions involved from a dispassionate,
value-free point of view should not
imply that we do not appreciate the
intellectual and emotional difficulties
that must be overcome on all decision-
making levels before these questions
are generally acknowledged by others
for what they are. They reflect, on an
intellectual level, traditional emotional
resistance to new forms of weaponry.
Nor, simply because we have not
discussed them, do we minimise the
massive reconciliation of conflicting
interests which domestic as well as
international agreement on proceeding
toward genuine peace presupposes.
Although no insuperable obstacle lies
in the path of reaching such general
agreements, formidable short-term
private-group and general-class interest
in maintaining the war system is well
established and widely recognised. The
resistance to peace stemming from
such interest is only tangential, in the
long run, to the basic functions of war,
but it will not be easily overcome, in
this country or elsewhere. Some
observers, in fact, believe that it cannot
be overcome at all in our time, that the
price of peace is, simply, too high.
This bears on our overall conclusions
to the extent that timing in the trans-
ference to substitute institutions may
often be the critical factor in their
political feasibility. r
It is uncertain, at this time, whether
peace will ever be possible. It is far
more questionable, by the objective
standard of continued social survival
rather than that of emotional pacifism,
that it would be desirable even if it
were demonstrably attainable. The
war system, for all its subjective repug-
nance to important sections of “public
opinion,” has demonstrated its effective-
ness since the beginning of recorded
history; it has provided the basis for
the development of many impressively
durable civilisations, including that
which is dominant today. It has con-
sistently provided unambiguous social
priorities. It is, on the whole, a known
quantity. A viable system of peace,
assuming that the great and complex
questions of substitute institutions
raised in this Report are both soluble
and solved, would still constitute a
venture into the unknown, with the
inevitable risks attendant on the unfore-
seen, however small and however well
hedged.
A more expedient reason for pur-
suing the investigation of alternate
ways and means to serve the current
functions of war is narrowly political.
It is possible that one or more major
sovereign nations may arrive, through
ambiguous leadership, at a position in
which a' ruling administrative class
may lose control of basic public
opinion or of its ability to rationalise
a desired war. It is not hard to
imagine, in such circumstance, a situa-
tion in which such governments may

Variable Sweep Wings: A report from General Dynamics
A major step forward
in aircraft design:
Every day, numbers of pilots are rede-
signing their planes in flight. Shortly
after takeoff, each pilot moved a trom-
bone-shaped slide in his cockpit and
swept back the wings of his plane.
The ability to do this made the F-l 11
the first aircraft that can (1) operate from
short landing fields, and (2) fly econom-
ically for long subsonic cruise ranges
such as transoceanic ferry flights, and
(3) strike supersonically at treetop height
or dash at two-and-a-half times the
speed of sound at an altitude of 12 miles.
The key is -its variable sweep wing.
Today more than thirty F-l 1 l’s built by
General Dynamics are demonstrating
the feasibility of a movable wing—a de-
velopment that finally makes a truly
multi-purpose airplane practical.
The matter of
flight envelope:
Every aircraft has a specific “envelope”
a set of limitations, or boundaries, of
speed and altitude, within which it can
operate effectively. The final design of
a plane depends upon which of several
possible purposes is most important.
A long wing extended straight out is
best for short takeoff and landing, long
range and endurance, or high load-car-
rying characteristics. For the high lift

demanded, a large amount of wing sur-
face is needed.
As speed increases, the wing can gen-
erate more lift—consequently less wing
area is required at these high speeds.
Large wings produce undesirably high
resistance to airflow. Such an airplane
can be pushed to supersonic speed by
brute power, but not efficiently. The
aerodynamic term for this resistance to
airflow is “drag,” and one way to reduce
drag at high speeds is to sweep the wings
back. The maximum speed at which the
airplane is to operate determines the
amount of wing sweep.
For instance, the modern passenger
jet, whose wings are partially swept
back, can fly efficiently for long dis-
tances just below the speed of sound.
But the swept wing provides less lift,
and such aircraft need long runways,
sometimes up to two miles long, and
special braking devices.
Very high speeds—faster than sound-
can best be reached with a very small
wing, sometimes in a triangle or delta
shape. But the still lower lift can require
even longer runways, and additional
braking devices such as drogue para-
chutes. The very small wing offers con-
siderably less fuel efficiency. for long-
range, subsonic flight.
Three aircraft in one:
A wing whose position can be changed
by a pilot in flight gives a single airplane
the special talents of all three types.
With the wing fully extended, the air-
craft has high lift for short takeoff or
landing or high-load capacity. With the
wings partially swept, efficient long-
range subsonic flight becomes practical.
Pulling the wings all the way back to
their smallest exposed area provides su-
personic dash, without having sacrificed
either high lift or cruise economy.
Previous—and impractical—attempts
to achieve variable wing geometry go
all the way back to 1911. The chief
problem: an undesirable relationship
between center of gravity and center of
lift as the wings moved would cause an
airplane to nose up and down sharply-
become longitudinally unstable.
How it operates:
Not until 1960 did the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration con-
ceive the answer to this instability—
simultaneously sweeping both wings
around separate pivot points which
were moved out on the wing root rather

than having a single pivot in the center
of the fuselage. The concept has been
refined and developed by General Dy-
namics through more than 30,000 hours
of wind tunnel testing, and more than
25 million man-hours of design and de-
velopment.
The F-Ill’s variable wing can be
moved in flight from its fully extended
position (technically with 16° of sweep
measured at the leading edge) to a full
sweep of 12.5° , with the wings tucked
back against (and much of them actual-
ly inside) the fuselage for a narrow delta
shape. The position of the wings can be
set and held at any position between
these two extremes, with the pilot him-
self deciding what wing setting is best
for maximum performance in a given
set of circumstances. He can normally
lever the wings from one extreme to the
other in about twenty seconds.
The precision of design is so exact
and the wing so balanced that negligible
elevator trim is needed to compensate
for full sweep of the wing.
Heart of the system:
The heart of the F-l 1 l’s variable sweep
system is a 14-foot steel yoke across the
fuselage (see drawing below).
The movable portions of each wing
are fastened to the yoke by BVi-inch
diameter high-strength steel pivot pins.
Forward of the yoke hydraulically pow-
ered actuators, responding to the pilot’s
control selection, move the wings from
one position to another.
For additional high lift at takeoff and
landing, full span slats and flaps are
incorporated into the wing. The wing it-
self is ingeniously tapered so that much
of its area when fully extended is high-
ly cambered —that is, with a relatively

with its 8½-inch diameter pins, on which
the wings pivot, is the heart of the vari-
able sweep winged F-111. The yoke and
pins support the whole plane in flight. A
jackscrew just forward of the yoke actu-
ates the wings during sweep.
thick curve for greater lift—and thin at
the area remaining exposed when wings
are swept back for high-speed flight.
The future for the
sweep wing:
Since the Wright Brothers’ first break-
through in the art of manned flight,
there have been relatively few major ad-
vances in the basic art of airplane build-
ing. One was the introduction of light
aluminum structures, another the intro-
duction of the turbine—better known as
the jet—engine for propulsion.
The variable sweep wing represents
a similar major step forward. For any
category of aircraft—military, commer-
cial or private—where the combination
of very high-speed flight, long economic
cruise and high lift for easy takeoff and
landing is desired, the variable sweep
wing sets the new standard. Even space
ships may ultimately incorporate some
form of variable geometric wing to
make them more maneuverable within
different atmospheres.

feel forced to initiate serious full-scale
disarmament proceedings (perhaps
provoked by "accidental” nuclear
explosions), and that such negotia-
tions may lead to the actual dis-
establishment of military institutions.
As our Report had made clear, this
could be catastrophic. It seems evident
that, in the event an important part of
the world is suddenly plunged without
sufficient warning into an inadvertent
peace, even partial and inadequate
preparation for the possibility may be
better than none. And despite our
strictures against knowingly proceed-
ing into peace-transition procedures
without thorough substantive prepara-
tion, our Government must neverthe-
less be ready to move in this direction
with whatever limited resources of
planning are on hand at the time—if
circumstances so require.
But the principal cause for concern
over the continuing effectiveness of
the war system, and the more import-
ant reason for hedging with peace
planning, lies in the backwardness of
current war-system programming. Its
controls have not kept pace with the
technological advances it has made
possible. Despite its unarguable success
to date, even in this era of unprece-
dented potential in mass destruction,
it continues to operate largely on a
laissez-faire basis. To the best of our
knowledge, no serious quantified
studies have ever been conducted to
determine, for example:
• optimum levels of armament pro-
duction, for purposes of economic
control, at any given series of chrono-
logical points and under any given
relationship between civilian production
and consumption patterns;
• , correlation factors between draft-
recruitment policies and mensurable
social dissidence;
• minimum levels of population
destruction necessary to maintain wrar-
threat credibility under varying polit-
ical conditions;
• optimum cyclical frequency of
“shooting” wars under varying circum-
stances of historical relationship.
These and other war-function
factors are fully susceptible to analysis
by today’s computer-based systems, but
they have not been so treated; modern
analytical techniques have up to now
been relegated to such aspects of the
ostensible functions of war as pro-
curement, personnel deployment,
weapons analysis, and the like. We do
not disparage these types of applica-
tion, but only deplore their lack of
utilisation to greater capacity in
attacking problems of broader scope.
No systems can long survive at either
input or output levels that consistently
or substantially deviate from an
optimum range. As their data grow'
increasingly sophisticated, the war
system and its functions are increasingly
endangered by such deviations.
Our final conclusion, therefore, v is
that it will be necessary for our
Government to plan in depth for two
general contingencies. 'The first, and
lesser, is the possibility of a viable
general peace; the second is the success-
ful continuation of the war system. In
our view, careful preparation for .the
possibility of peace should be extended,
not because we take the position that
the end of war would necessarily be
desirable, if it is in fact possible, but
because it may be thrust upon us in
some form whether we are readv for
it or not. Planning for rationalising
and quantifying the war system, on
the other hand, to ensure the effective-
ness of its major stabilising functions,
is not only more promising in respect
to anticipated results but is essential;
we can no longer take for granted that
it will continue to serve our purposes
well merely because it always has.
The objective of government policy
must be to preserve maximum options.
The recommendations which follow-
are directed to this end.
RECOMMENDATIONS
(1) We propose the establishment,
under executive order of the President,
of a permanent War/Peace Research
Agency, empowered and mandated to
execute the programs described in 2 and
3, below. This agency (a) will be pro-
vided with nonaccountable funds suf-
ficient to implement its responsibilities
and decisions at its own discretion, and
(b) w ill have authority to pre-empt and
utilise, without restriction, any and all
facilities of the executive branch of the
Government in pursuit of its objectives.
Its authority will expressly include the
unlimited right to w ithhold information
on its activities and its decisions, from
anyone except the President, whenever
it deems such secrecy to be in the public
interest.
(2) The first of the War/Peace Re-
search Agency’s two principal responsi-
bilities will be to determine all that can
be known, including what can reason-
ably be inferred in terms of relevant
statistical probabilities, that may bear
on an eventual transition to a general
condition of peace. This aspect of the
Agency’s work will hereinafter be called
“Peace Research.”
The Agency’s Peace Research activi-
ties will necessarily include, but not be
limited to, the following:
(a) The creative development of pos-
sible substitute institutions for the prin-
cipal non-military functions of war.
(b) The careful matching of such
institutions against the criteria sum-
marised in this Report.
(c) The testing and evaluation of
substitute institutions, for accepta-
bility, feasibility, and credibility,
against hypothecated transitional and
postwar conditions.
(d) The development and testing of
the correlativity of multiple substitute
institutions.
(e) The preparation of a wide-
ranging schedule of partial, uncorre-
lated, crash programs of adjustment.
(3) The War/Peace Research
Agency's other principal responsibility
will be "War Research.” Its funda-
mental objective will be to ensure the
continuing viability of the war system
to fulfil its essential non-military
functions for as long as the war system
is judged necessary to or desirable for
the survival of society. To achieve
this end, the War Research groups
within the agency will engage in the
following activities:
(a) Quantification of existing ap-
plication of the non-military functions
of icar.
(b) Establishment of a priori mod-
ern criteria for the execution of the
non-military functions of war.
(c) Reconciliation of these criteria
with prevailing economic, political,
sociological, and ecological limitations.
The ultimate object of this phase of
War Research is to rationalise the here-
tofore informal operations of the war
system. It should provide practical
working procedures through which
responsible governmental authority may
resolve the following war-function prob-
lems, among others, under any given
circumstances: (1) how to determine
the optimum quantity, nature, and
timing of military expenditures to
ensure a desired degree of economic
control; (2) how to organise the recruit-
ment, deployment, and ostensible use
of military personnel to ensure a desired
degree of acceptance of authorised
social values; (3) how to compute on a
short-term basis, the nature and extent
of the loss of life and other resources
which should be suffered and/or in-
flicted during any single outbreak of
hostilities to achieve a desired degree
of internal political authority and social
allegiance; (4) how to project, over
extended periods, the nature and quality
of overt warfare which must be planned
and budgeted to achieve a desired
degree of contextual stability for the
same purpose; factors to be determined
must include frequency of occurrence,
length of phase, intensity of pnysical
destruction, extensiveness of geographi-
cal involvement, and optimum mean
loss of life; (5) how to extrapolate
accurately from the foregoing, for
ecological purposes, the continuing
effect of the war system over such
extended cycles on population pres-
sures, and to adjust the planning of
casualty rates accordingly.
(4) Since both programs of the War/
Peace Research Agency will share the
same purpose—to maintain govern-
mental freedom of choice in respect to
war and peace until the direction of
social survival is no longer in doubt—
it is of the essence of this proposal that
the agency be constituted without limi-
tation of time. Its examination of exist-
ing and proposed institutions will be
self-liquidating when its own function
shall have been superseded by the his-
torical developments it will have, at
least in part, initiated. END


OVERSEAS
Is Hanoi for peace, or out
to skewer Washington?
By MARK FRANKLAND in Saigon
SIGNS ARE NOW falling thick and
fast that Hanoi has embarked on a
peace strategy that could cause Wash-
ington just as much trouble as its pre-
vious military toughness. The strategy
has three prongs, involving simultaneous
action in the diplomatic, military, and
political field.
The first phase seems to have been
completed with the carefully publicised
statement by Nguyen Duy Trinh, the
North Vietnamese Foreign Minister,
that Hanoi would hold talks with the
United States if bombardment of the
North were stopped.
In the military field, preparatory
moves began last November when Viet
Cong and North Vietnamese began an
aggressive dry-season offensive in the
South with attacks on Loc Ninh and >
Dak To. The chosen areas are along
the Vietnamese border with Cambodia
and Laos and the northern provinces
just below the demilitarised zone. Last
week saw two more big communist
attacks, one in northern Quang Nam
Province and the other outside Tay
Ninh City, just across the Cambodian
border. Although the Viet Cong and
North Vietnamese troops have already
suffered heavy losses, the American
military believe there is still plenty of
steam left in the offensive.
The political part of the strategy
also got under way last year. It involves
propelling the National Liberation
Front, the political arm of the Viet
Cong, into the limelight as a possible
partner in a South Vietnamese Coalition
Government. Aspects of this have been
increasing diplomatic activity of the
Front abroad, the publication of its new
program last August, and most clearly
the explanation to Viet Cong political
cadres in the South of how a coalition
government would work to their advan-
tage.
The overall strategy is apparently
based on the view long held in Hanoi
that a stage might be reached in the
war when it would be advantageous ta
negotiate and continue fighting at the
same time.
In April, 1966, a senior North Viet-
namese general told an important Viet
Cong congress that it was possible the
North might conduct negotiations while
the South continued fighting, and that
the South might also participate in the
negotiations while continuing to fight.
This ploy is possible because Hanoi has
never abandoned its fiction that there
are no North Vietnamese troops in
South Vietnam, but only Viet Cong
guerillas. According to the latest Ameri-
can estimate, there are about 54,000
men in North Vietnamese units in the
South.
The big unknown in Hanoi’s strategy
is whether it has been launched out of
a sense of weakness or strength. There
is some evidence that Hanoi was, for
various reasons, feeling the pinch when
Foreign Minister Trinh made an almost
identical offer of talks a year ago, just
before the visit to London of Soviet
Premier Kosygin. Recent visitors to
Hanoi, who also visited the northern
capital last winter, give the impression
that this is no longer true.
In either case, the main threat to
Washington and Saigon is Hanoi’s dex-
terous manipulation of all the factors
that go to make up the complex Viet-
nam war. For the diplomatic offensive,
combined with continuing fierce fighting
in the South, can be relied on now to
make maximum impact on American,
world, and, not least, South Vietnamese
opinion.
In the view of observers in Saigon, •
the deadliest of Hanoi’s three prongs is
the political one for, when the negoti-
ating chips are down, the embarrassing
fact of the National Liberation Front’s
political strength in the South will be
clear for all to see.
It is already plain to South Viet-
namese politicians that the Viet Cong,
with its 80,000 trained political cadres,
would dominate any compromise solu-
tion for South Vietnam’s future that
negotiators might devise. Viet Cong con-
fidence on this score was reflected in
briefings given to cadres during the
latter part of 1967.

and later captured by American troops
included the remark that to all appear-
ances there would be a coalition
government, but the real power would
lie “in our hands.”
The danger of Washington and
Saigon being skewered by this third
prong will certainly be used by many
people in Saigon as an argument for
not allowing any sort of negotiating
process to get under way. The atmos-
phere is already uncertain enough fol-
lowing recent rumors about American
interest in the possibility of a coalition.
The Trinh statement is bound to make
matters worse. No comfort for Saigon
either from U.S. Secretary of State
Dean Rusk, who says the U.S. will go
“more than half way” if North Vietnam
really wants peace.
Officials here are disturbed by the
drop in the number of Viet Cong
defectors who are encouraged to come
over to the Saigon Government under
the Chieu Hoi open-arms program. The
weekly rate of such defections is now
lower than at any time in the past two
years. American officials have specu-
lated that this may be related to the
talk of a coalition and hopes of peace
negotiations.
Another indication of the atmosphere
are rumors that well-to-do people have
begun to move out of the exposed
northern cities of Quang Tri and Hue.
This is always a barometer of Viet-
namese opinion, since it is obstinately
believed, in spite of government
denials, that this area might be sacri-
ficed in any deal with the Viet Cong.
There is also fear that the South
Vietnamese will to continue fighting
scarcely rock-hard at best might
crumble altogether once there was a
prospect of serious talks. The state of
mind on this score may be judged by
the current rumpus caused by the
Saigon Government’s new Mobilisation
Dean Rusk at a news conference on
Hanoi’s offer to talk if the bombing
ceases
Bill, which will for the first time draft
Vietnamese boys between 18 and 20
and recall older men who have already
completed military service. It is very
hard to find anyone in Saigon, except
for Americans, who has a good word to
say for the Bill.
Hanoi’s new strategy has also been
well timed, coming just before the Viet-
namese New Year, which falls at the


end of this month. This is the tradi-
tional time for family reunion and will
be marked by a two-day truce, which
could be used to make the start of a
real bombing pause as painless as pos-
sible.
In these circumstances, it is scarcely
surprising if the American and Viet-
namese officials here feel that respond-
ing to Hanoi’s ploy might be more
dangerous than continuing the .war
along its present bloody but at least
reasonably well-charted course.
U.S. dollar
Money-go-round
WITH PRESIDENT JOHNSON’S
financial measures it looks as if General
de Gaulle has got what he wanted.
Will the General and the rest of the Six
now keep their part of the bargain?
There is no doubt that they can carry
the brunt of the American measures.
President Johnson is chasing $3OOO mil-
lion; the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development reckons the
Six will run a current account surplus
this year of $3400 million and their
collective reserves are one and half
times those of America.
The danger is, however, that, once
the surpluses that Europe has grown
to expect start dwindling, the Six will
try to restore them by cutting home
demand. When the Texas measures
failed to reduce the deficit, America
would institute still further doses of
retrenchments; and so the merry-go-
round would gather speed. It would
become a beggar-my-neighbor fight
which no one could possibly win and
in which everyone’s growth rate suf-
fered.
The worst possible outcome would be
if Europe pulled in its horns without
actually waiting to see if the American
measures work. All the signs are that
the President has been hopelessly
optimistic. The mandatory cutback of
business investment abroad rests on thin
ice.
The most dangerous threat probably
arises from the already mooted possi-
bility of a court challenge on whether
the President’s assertion of executive
power over the investments that Ameri-
can companies can make overseas is
constitutional. To justify his action, Mr.
Johnson relied on emergency powers
originally granted to President Wood-
row Wilson in 1917 during World War
I, and to some lawyers this seems fragile
ground on which, in a period tech-
nically of peace, to disrupt the tradit-
ional workings of the American cap-
italist system.
To undermine the Government’s
whole effort, a legal challenge from
resentful corporate executives would not
necessarily have to succeed in the
courts. A single temporary injunction
could be enough to paralyse enforce-
ment during a crucial period. Less
dramatic but equally damaging, the
Administration has to expect protracted
quarrels with big business companies
operating overseas what sums
earned abroad really count as profits
required now to be repatriated.
Nor does the future of the proposed
limitations on foreign touring look any
more certain. The voluntary system of
exhortation (“See America First”)
having failed, the President, has been
driven to warn the nation of impend-
ing legislation to restrict the rights of
Americans to go on foreign holidays.
Few measures could be less popular
in an election year, and it is by no
means assured that Congress will give
the Administration the mandatory
powers it is now requesting.
President Johnson’s measures, to be
in force for two years, are aimed at
saving $3OOO million a year in foreign
exchange by reducing foreign invest-
ment and loans by $l5OO million,
cutting government spending overseas
by $5OO million, shaving overseas tourist
spending by $5OO million, and increasing
the trade surplus by $5OO million.
No one is saying anything for the
record as to what exactly would hap-
pen if the present measures fail to cut
back the balance of payments deficit
and thereby inevitably increase the run
on the dollar. But there are dark and
private hints of further options that
the President has open to him
domestic wage/price controls, even the
withdrawal of all American troops for
Europe.
It is certainly true that there are
a number of stops down the line before
devaluation: But as in Britain three
years ago there is a small but vocal
school of thought among American
economists which maintains that the
President has already made the wrong
decision. “Come back next New Year’s
Day,” one Government official is
being quoted as having told a “Wall
Street Journal” reporter, “and you’ll
be just in time for the devaluation
announcement.”
Even if all goes well and the
measures are successful, they will re-
lease in the American economy an
extra $3OOO million of spending power.
The economy is already overheating and
for the past 12 months President John-
son has tried valiantly but vainly to
get Congress to approve a 10 percent
tax increase to cool things down.
Once again we are bang up against
the lunacy of the present monetary
system. America is the world’s richest
country and for the most part it has
used that wealth wisely. Europe, and
particularly Britain, would be much
poorer places without the vast inflow
of American business investment of the
past 20 years. Yet this rich nation has
now to check that capital outflow and
try to stop it nationals’ holidays abroad.
If America’s deficit is to disappear,
something must be put in its place,
otherwise the world’s wealth will simply
not grow fast enough to alleviate the
suffering of the poor and hungry. What
is needed is a new world currency, man-
made and man-controlled, that could
be expanded to meet the demands of
international trade and investment. The
beginnings of such a scheme exist in the
contingency plan for special drawing
rights approved at last year’s Interna-
tional Monetary meeting. Although
France approved the plan in principle,
it still seems to be fighting a rearguard
action over its implementation.
Already pondering a small deficit,
France will suffer more than most from
the American measures. The possibility
of the franc taking over the unenviable
role of Europe’s “problem currency”
may persuade French officials to
actively support the scheme.
It is more likely, however, that
France will stick to the line that if a
major increase in liquidity is needed
it should come from an increase in the
price of gold and to hell with American
worries that it would be a loss of
face for the dollar and that big bene-
fits would go to Russia and South
Africa. With reserves of over $6OOO
million the General can afford to play
a waiting game.
Administration leaders explaining the dollar moves are (left to right) Federal
Reserve Board chairman Wm. McChesney Martin, Secretary of State Dean Rusk,
Treasury Secretary Henry Fowler, Commerce Secretary Alexander Trowbridge, and
Gardner Ackley, chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers

Singapore-Malaysia
Exit Britain,
enter Japan
THERE ARE strong pressures on
Singapore to pull out of the sterling
area, reclaim its reserves of about £2OO
million, and cancel all economic prefer-
ences granted to Britain if British forces
are withdrawn from the island by 1971
instead of 1975 as promised.
Embittered Government advisers, who
are urging Premier Lee Kuan Yew to
plan painful economic reprisals against
any future “perfidy,” would expect
Malaysia, second largest holder of sterl-
ing after Hong Kong, to follow suit.
This is just the beginning of their
harsh arithmetic. They also estimate that
Britain will save only a maximum of
£7O million in foreign exchange between
1971 and 1975 by abandoning her bases
early, but can be made to pay for her
desertion by sacrificing earnings through
Singapore worth some £75 million every
year “for 100 years.”
Even before the Commonwealth Re-
lations Secretary, Mr. George Thomson,
flew in at the weekend, anxious and fret-
ful Ministers in Malaysia and Singapore
were convinced that he was merely going
to confirm that the British forces would
pack up and leave in 1971, never to re-
turn.
Stolidly ignoring the portents,
Malaysia’s sanguine* Premier, Tunku
Abdul Rahman, is firmly in favor of
a five-power meeting in Kuala Lum-
pur to co-ordinate common defence
measures among Malaysia, Singapore,
Australia, and New Zealand, with the
participation of Britain.
He still believes that sophisticated
British air and naval weaponry must
complement Malaysia’s ground forces,
and that Britain must continue to con-
tribute her 2000-strong battalion group
to the Commonwealth Strategic Re-
serve in Malacca.
Most officials, however, dismiss
Britain’s pledges to maintain sea-and-
air defence “capability” in the area
after closing the main bases as no
more credible than the “string of
broken assurances given in the past.”
There are no signs that Britain in-
tends to store heavy munitions and
equipment in Singapore to serve
troops suddenly dispatched from Eng-
land by air to meet some emergency,
or to leave men to service Changi air-
field, where they would have to land.
The formula for the U.K.-based “fire
brigade force” is therefore meaningless,
it is argued, and few have faith in
the project for a British amphibious
fleet permanently afloat in Malaysian
waters, supported by naval installations
and an airfield at Darwin, which
would take the RAF’s already
problematical Fills.
If the British write off South-East
Asia, Singapore must write off the


British, policy advisers say today. If
British Bloodhound rockets go, Singa-
pore’s own forces must buy Japanese
Hawk missiles. And this policy must
be carried through to its logical end.
The situation in which Singapore is
dominated by British banks and busi-
ness houses, by British cars, and a ship-
ping conference in which most of the
ships are British, must be reversed.
Singaporeans are beginning to feel
that they can do a roaring business
without the benefit of Britain, if neces-
sary. Japanese banks and Japanese
industry and Japanese shipping inter-
ests are only waiting on the sidelines
to fill as much of the vacuum as they
can, it is claimed.
In the second half of 1967 Singapore
trans-shipment trade in goods from
China more than quadrupled, and
there is a strong local conviction that
Peking would like to reduce her eco-
nomic reliance on colonial Hong Kong.
Britain would also be throwing away
itfe vast installations in Singapore, which
are providing nearly 30,000 servicemen
and their families with everything from
housing and hospitals to schools and
swimming-pools. For Singapore will not
pay a cent toward buying back her own
soil. As one angry government poli-
tician told me: “They can take their
installations with them, brick by brick,
or blow them up on the spot.”
Backing Britain
The Surbiton way
WHEN THE newspapers first reported
that five girl typists at a heating and
ventilation firm in Surbiton, Surrey,
had told their surprised boss that they
wanted to come to their office half
an hour earlier each day, without extra
pay, in order to produce for Britain,
the fashionable response in many
sophisticated circles was a giggle. Ever
since then the giggle has been fading
and transforming itself into, by now,
something louder than a grunt of
admiration.
The transformation has been helped
not only by those led by the Duke of
Edinburgh (at a considerable risk of
satire), and followed at some distance
by the Prime Minister, who congratu-
lated these bread-and-butter misses, and
by those who have joined them in the
pledge to “back Britain” with an extra
half-hour’s work a day (including sev-
eral factories, to the amazement of some
union officials), but also by the asininity
of their opponents. The girls have be-
come television folk-heroines, aided by
a TV confrontation with a national
union leader who talked down to them
and preached that wage and salary
costs accounted for less than 10 percent
of the cost of almost every product
(which, since wage and salary pay-
ments amount to over 60 percent of
gross national product, was an ignorant
untruth), and with miners from a Welsh
pit that had over 80 percent absenteeism
on New Year’s Day (because, explained
the miners in the studio, they had
naturally drunk themselves sick on New
Year’s Eve).
This is not a question for economists,
and calculators; but it is not one for
sophisters either. The economically
effective part of the mood of a nation
depends on such intangible things as
who laughs at what when, and which
actions stir guilt complexes. No doubt
oply very marginally, perhaps only very
temporarily, the five typists of Surbiton
may very well have accomplished the
extraordinary feat of edging a national
mood just an odd half-degree in the
right direction.
India
A patriot freed
SHEIK . ABDULLAH, India’s most
experienced political prisoner, was freed
from all restrictions last week. He was
abruptly deprived of the Prime Minister-
ship of Kashmir and imprisoned in 1953
(but never convicted of anything). Since
then he has been released twice; for a
few months in 1958, for more than a
year in 1964-65. By this third release,
the Indian Government hopes to do
what the sheik’s detention, whether in
jail or in the cool political quarantine of
a hill resort, has never done: settle the
internal politics of Indian Kashmir.
The State was something less than a
democracy in Abdullah’s day. For ten
years thereafter a particularly rough-
and-ready successor, Bakshi Ghulam
Mohammed, kept the lid screwed on
until his methods' of government be-
came too much even for New Delhi.
But removing him only revealed what
a head of steam had built up. Kashmir’s
Moslems, if they did not actively want
to become Pakistanis, patently did not
appreciate the benefit of being Indians.
Even in 1967, after three years of
tolerable government and an unsuccess-
ful guerilla invasion organised by Pakis-
tan, the ruling party had still to rig
the elections in the overwhelmingly
Moslem heart of the State.
These tensions may not be resolved
by Abdullah’s release, but keeping him
in detention clearly only prolonged
them. The arguments for taking a
chance were that while he remains
obstinately pro-Kashmiri he is not anti-
Indian; that the Indians have demon-
strated conclusively that they will
neither be talked nor fought into giving
up what they hold; and that no
country with any influence to change
their minds is ready to try doing so.
In these circumstances a Kashmiri pat-
riot might well decide to make the best
of a not-so-bad job.
South-East Asia
Freak fringe
From DENNIS BLOODWORTH in Singapore
THE EAST-WEST struggle for the,
hearts and minds of men has a freak
fringe. The past year has ended with a
flourish of collectors’ items from it.
Chinese Communists put their nuclear
bomb on Christmas cards, and in Hong
Kong depicted the British Governor
as a Santa Claus dispensing “salty
water, devaluation, and bad laws.” At
a charity party given for refugee chil-
dren by a British concern, toys were
found wrapped with such messages as
“All Reactionaries are Paper Tigers.”
In Sarawak, illegal stamps bearing
mottoes of Mao Tse Tung sold quickly,
and his forbidden little red book of
thoughts was pulled out of lucky-dip
barrels by children in Malaya.
In the sociological field, the increas-
ing popularity of the pill further
stimulated last week by a Malaysian
Minister who strikingly warned: “More
accidents occur in beds than on roads”
has been such that planners have
been obliged to abandon as “highly un-
economical” a project for using some
of the country’s surplus natural rubber
to manufacture contraceptives. It is
now suggested, however, that this slack
may be taken up by using rubber to
make “silent” mahjong tiles instead.
This concept is strange to the East,
where the rattle of the shuffled stone or
plastic pieces is the noisiest noise after
the constant crepitation of Chinese fire-
crackers.
Against the lunacies of men in the
mass in China, Vietnam, and else-
where the end of an odd year was
marked by two ominous phenomena in
the rest of the animal kingdom. In
mid-December, 10,000 toads divided
into two armies to fight a seven-hour
battle in a field in southern Thailand
in which hundreds died. One week
later in north-east Thailand, thousands
of frogs, apparently seized with a death
wish, all impaled themselves on the
same thorn bush. The senseless war
of the toads and the mass suicide of
the frogs were alike regarded with
foreboding by watchers, who believed
that they presaged a disaster in the
coming year. Unerringly human in
their behaviour, they may not have
been foreshadowing 1968 but merely
summing up 1967.


BUSINESS
AND FINANCE
No more cliff-hanging for
Robe River’s iron ore
THE NEW AMERICAN restraints on
investment will not affect the project in
any way, so among Australia’s first
major financial announcements for 1968
is likely to be that the Cliffs mining
venture, based on Western Australia’s
Robe River, is officially on. Agreement
in principle is expected at the end of
this month, with all loose ends tied off
next month nicely timed before the
State elections in late February or
March. After three years of cliff-
hanging, there will be substantial
changes in virtually all aspects of the
scheme. Some of these have been made
known, despite the Cliffs organisation’s
extreme conservatism, but other aspects
will surprise and perhaps shock those
still thinking in terms of the group’s
original structure.
When the first Cliffs agreement was
announced late in 1964, it was based
on the upgrading and pelletising of
71.4 million tons of the Robe River
limonites, the pelletising to be done at
Cape Preston, which would be linked
to the orebody around Mount Enid by
a 60-mile railway line. Cleveland Cliffs
Iron Co., of Ohio, were to have held
51 percent of the equity, Mitsui 35
percent, Garrick Agnew 1\ percent,
with 6j percent still to be allocated.
The price negotiated was a high 19.1
cents per unit.
The new agreement, whose final
shape will depend on a Japanese pro-
posal to be made in mid-January, will
be considerably bigger, with through-
put increased from 3.6 to a total of 7.7
million tons annually. Of this, 4.2 mil-
lion tons will be as pellets (the same
specifications as in the original con-
tract), but to this is added 3.5 million
tons of fines a year. This is ore that will
pass through a half-inch mesh. In the
past, limonitic fines have been sold only
for use in blending; to have them
accepted as a mineral in their own
right, and in such quantities, is seen as
a significant breakthrough.
The final horse-trading in Tokyo
concerns the economic testing of these
fines. A 5000-ton sample is on the way
to Japan for this full-scale commercial
testing, although the Japanese have said
they have no doubts about the mat-
erial’s technical feasibility. Price is not
contingent on these tests. So the only
possible hitch to the scheme going
ahead in the next few weeks would be
the remote chance of the full-scale fines
test proving this form of limonite to be
too expensive to use.
Compared superficially with the
original high 19.1 cents per unit, which
would have been the highest price paid
to any Australian ore-miner, the final
prices will seem low. When the latest
round of negotiations resumed in Sep-
tember, Cliffs offered 87.5 million tons
of pellets at 18.75 cents per unit f.o.b.
over 21 years and 50.5 million tons of
fines at 10.75 cents per unit over 15
years. The pellet price is believed to
have come down to 18.5 cents, but the
fines would come down to a point where
there might be cries of “quarry” from
the Liberals’ opponents, both across
the floor and across the coalition.
But similar material has already been
sold from Australia for less than 10
cents as overburden, for this is
how it was regarded until the recent
reassessment. And it is considered in
State Government circles that to get
10 cents per unit would be a triumph,
the equivalent of 12.5 cents for higher
grade hematite fines. Limonites can-
not be compared directly on Fe con-
tent, it is pointed out, for to shift
ere with a 56 percent content from
mine to port, port to port, then port
to. plant entails the same outlay for
less return than the same journey with
hematite, with 64 percent iron; there
is similar disparity in the sinter plant,
and to this is added the cost of driving
off the contained moisture.
Cliffs’ most widely publicised change
concerns its new port, a move from
Cape Preston to the longer haul
crossing Hamersley Iron’s Tom Price-
Dampier line to Cape Lambert, 105
miles against 60. However, this port
will be a vastly different proposition
to the expensively-enclosed harbor of
Port Hedland where Mount Newman
operations centre. Cape Lambert will
need minimal dredging to accommodate
100,000-tonners, which are too big for
Hedland until much more dredging is
done.
With all negotiations on price, pro-
duct, and port completed, the final step
would then be establishing the struc-
ture of the operating group. Here a
number of possibilities are still being
considered, but Daniel K. Ludwig
still negotiating with the Western Aus-
talian Government through his Sen-
tinel Mining Co., based 200 miles up
the coast from Cape Lambert will
emerge as the biggest shareholder.
D. K. Ludwig ... formidable
Cleveland Cliffs will continue to
manage the operation on a compara-
tively small shareholding. Also, Aus-
tralians will participate to the extent
of “not less than 15 nor more than
25 percent,” according to Mr. Charles
Court.'
Cliffs have doubled in size since
first conception, with a $240 million
project envisaged on the strength of
contracts worth more than $l3OO
million. Australian institutions will be
called upon for loan capital relative
to the Australian component, and will
probably be offered some equity. The
Australian 20-25 percent is likely to
be split three ways Garrick Agnew’s
percent, the Australian institutions,
and the Australian investing public in
a new float.
Ludwig’s part in Cliffs could prove
embarrassing, if only because the
world’s most successful bulk ship-
owner, by the mystery that surrounds
him, could be painted in a sinister
shade for those seeking to turn a
triumph into a political hot potato. But
the State Government has welcomed
him into the group. Mr. Court says:
“The entry of Mr. Ludwig, who is
international in character, is regarded
as a good thing because of his con-
siderable financial capacity and his
undisputed knowledge and efficiency
in shipping. Add to this the technical
capacity of Cliffs, who have had more
than 100 years in this business, and
you have a very formidable combina-
tion.”

Speculating on the price of gold
THE LATEST RESTRICTIONS im-
posed by President Johnson on the
flow of American capital abroad make
it likely that attention will again be
directed this year on world liquidity
problems and in particular on the U.S.
dollar as the leading world currency.
With sterling devaluation still echoing
in the market places, there are plenty
of speculators willing to put their
money on a rise in the price of gold
in terms of U.S. dollars. And even
though there are plenty of reasons
which can be brought up against this
possibility, not the least of which is
the six months’ notice required by
Congress for ratification of any such
Treasury action which would place
speculators in a rather uncertain posi-
tion it nevertheless makes fairly
good sense to provide against the pos-
sibility of a rise in the gold price.
This insurance carries its inevitable
cost; for investors in gold mining com-
panies- the cost can be measured in
terms of the extent of the likely fall
in share prices if and when it becomes
quite clear that the U.S. dollar is no
longer in jeopardy. This is unlikely
to be signalled by one unmistakable
act, but will be the cumulative effect
of several events involving the success
(of otherwise) of the latest curbs on
overseas investment.
Many of our gold companies’ shares
are selling at prices which reflect not
only their possibilities as hedges
against a higher gold price but which
are the result of a high level of in-
terest in West Australian mineral
fields, and especially in those com-
panies with leases in the Kalgoorlie
district which are looked upon as
potential second Western Mining
corporations. But should the specu-
lators be correct, even these high
prices would be very cheap compared
with the scope for gain.
To date, Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie
(Aust.) Limited does not seem to carry
quite as high a speculative premium
stemming from nickel as do some of
its Kalgoorlie neighbors, and this com-
pany can be a useful starting point for
looking at the effects of a higher gold
price. Last year’s profit was $445,000
after the receipt of Commonwealth
Government subsidy of $1,182,000. The
Gold Mining Industry Assistance Act
provides for a subsidy based not on re-
venue or price but on costs of pro-
duction, but it would be unrealistic to
assume that this would be allowed to
continue should the price of gold be
increased. So the first thing to happen
to G.M.K. would be that it would lose
its subsidy (assuming that any increase
in the price of gold would be fairly
substantial perhaps doubling its pre-
sent price of SUS3S per ounce); With-
out the subsidy G.M.K. would have
lost some $737,000 but at SUS7O its
revenue would rise by almost $5,000,000
without any concomitant change in
cost. Income from gold mining is, of
course, exempt from taxation to Aus-
tralian residents, so none of this in-
crease in income suffers any taxation.
Thus the effect of doubling the price of
gold would be to raise G.M.K’s profit
to slightly over $4,000,000. On the
6,129,000 shares issued this is equiva-
lent to 65 cents per share quite a
boost from the company’s 1967 earnings
of 7 cents per share.
At current prices of around $1.40 it
is fairly clear that the rise in price
which would follow an increase in the
price of gold certainly warrants taking
the risk that the shares are likely to
fall from their present price should
either world liquidity problems be
solved or the company’s current ex-
ploration prospects turn out to be op-
timistic. Such a fall would hardly take
the shares to much less than 60 cents,
which price they would be selling for
8 times last year’s earnings of 7.3 cents
per share. So the speculators can regard
as their cost the possible fall of 80
cents in G.M.K. shares, while if suc-
cessful they can look forward to a rise
of perhaps $3.60 (i.e., up to $5 or
more) per share. These are odds of
slightly more than four to one.
While these potential gains and
losses may attract the heavy specula-
tors, more prudent investors may prefer
to hedge against the possibility of a
higher gold price by acquiring shares
in companies which, although capable
of rising, are less likely to fall as much,
either.
Emperor Gold Mines Limited, which
operates in Fiji, is one such company.
Last year it finally felt the effects of
increasing costs and profit fell below
zero for the first time for many years.
A loss of $70,412 was incurred after
the receipt of Fijian Government assist-
ance to the extent of some $157,000.
These shares are currently selling at
around 65 cents. Last year Emperor
produced 114,300 ounces of gold for
a total revenue of $3,591,000, and a
100 percent increase in the gold price
would mean a profit of about
$3,500,000 instead Of a loss. Such a
profit is equivalent to $1.57 per share,,
that is, about one and a half times the
current share price. Clearly there is
room here for a very substantial rise
in price while the utmost downside
risk is limited to around 30 cents.
New Guinea Goldfields N.L. appears
to have an even smaller downside
risk albeit at the sacrifice of possible
gain. It is currently earning reason-
able profits from the mining of gold
and silver at Wau in New Guinea and
in adidtion to these mining activities
it earns money as a sawmiller and
trader and is to supply a considerable
amount of timber to Japan in future
years.
Last year’s profit of $305,690 was
earned in part from the sale of gold
worth $509,000. A doubling of the
company’s gold receipts would bring
an increase of only some $536,000
not nearly as big a turnaround as the
other companies perhaps, but earnings


per share on the company’s 4,472,000
shares would rise from the current
6.8 cents to 19 cents. Currently sel-
ling for about 9 times earnings at 63
cents, which no doubt already carries
some element of hedging, it would be
quite reasonable to expect a rise to
$1.20 or more (i.e, six times one year’s
earnings).
This is a fairly modest rise when
compared to either Gold Mines of
Kalgoorlie or Emperor Gold Mines, but
on the other hand New Guinea Gold-
fields is already earning profits and
paying dividends of 3J cents per
share. Assuming that 8 percent is a
reasonable yield to expect from such
a company, this places a base price of
about 45 cents on the company’s shares.
The downside risk in this case is there-
fore even smaller, while the potential
benefit is still quite rewarding, and
while waiting for what may be a very
long time there is the added compen-
sation of a dividend return of 5£ per-
cent at the current price of 63 cents.
In terms of physical size, the new
Peko-Mount Morgan combination will
be Australia’s largest gold producer
when the Juno mine is operating at
full capacity. On the basis of last year’s
production, these two companies would
together benefit by a total of over
$4 million should the price of gold
ever be doubled. Last year their com-
bined profits totalled $4,582,000, and
certainly both companies (or the new
combined group) would receive a
considerable boost from a gold price
increase, with corresponding share
price increases. And here again the
downside risk is fairly small, particu-
larly in the case of Peko-Wallsend,
which can expect considerable profit
increases in the next few years from
its new Juno mine. But both these
companies are also producers of cop-
per, and must look forward to
fluctuations in the price of this metal.
Commodities
No millennium
during 1968
PROSPECTS FOR COMMODITY
prices in 1968 are mixed. Despite the
recovery in world industrial produc-
tion, the trend in metals may be down-
ward.
Copper looks set for the biggest fall
in 1968. It reached its present high
price (around £5BO a ton) almost solely
as a result of the strike at the United
States copper refineries. In July, just
before the strike, when consumers were
anyway overbuying in anticipation of
the worst, copper cost about $U.5.360
a ton less. The strike will soon have
cost close to a million tons of copper
or about a quarter of the world con-
sumption in 1966. But once the strike
is over and the immediate shortage
eliminated, prices seem sure to take a
nose-dive, though the unsettled labor
situation in Chile, the world’s third
largest copper producer, could at any
moment erupt into a strike.
Lead and zinc will almost certainly
fall. Prices of both metals varied little
during 1967, but forecasts point to a
strongish production rise in 1968,
mainly in the United States, Australia,
Canada, Peru, and Yugoslavia. Unless
world industrial activity recovers more
than is now expected, stocks of both
metals will start accumulating and
depressing prices.
Tin prices are also likely to slip as
world mine production increases, mak-
ing further sales from the United States
stockpile unnecessary. Should produc-
tion rise sufficiently and this largely
depends on Thailand and Indonesia,
where the anticipated increases for this
year did not materialise the Interna-
tional Tin Council may impose export
controls to keep the price fall within
limits.
Silver and nickel, the star perform-
ers of 1967, should remain high in
1968, with silver almost certainly
fluctuating wildly. Speculators’ silver
holdings on the New York market are
now equivalent to virtually five months
of world consumption, an amount that
could send prices plummeting when
the fever breaks. For shose looking for
a good speculation, the minor non-
ferrous metals, ranging from tungsten
to zirconium, now hold more promise.
Demand for these metals is roaring
ahead.
Sugar production is expected to fall
short of consumption for the first time
in nearly four years. Stocks in the
hands of exporters like Cuba, Australia,
and Brazil, currently estimated at 2
million-3 million tons, could fall by
over 1 million tons, which might spark
off a sizable price rise. But sugar’s
problem remains: there is no early
prospect of bringing the rich growers
of beet sugar notably the common
market under control.
Wheat prices are under the threat of
a new period of surplus. World pro-
duction for 1967-68 is put at 273 mil-
lion tons, a bit down on last year
because of the smaller Russian harvest.
But demand for exports is now expected
to shrink to 52 million tons, 10 million
tons less than two seasons ago. World
stocks may therefore rise again, to
around 39 million tons.
Wool prices are likely to remain
rather depressed, although probably
higher than in 1967. Stocks in New
Zealand, the world’s larger exporter of
crossbred wool, have climbed to around
four months’ normal exports. But so
long as New Zealand does not suddenly
unload these stocks, prices could
recover a little: only a small rise in
world output is expected this season,
less than the expected increase in
demand. Merino wool, coming mainly
from South Africa, Australia, and
Uruguay, should also do better.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: Following the
imposition of restrictions on overseas
capital investment in the United States,
the Australian Government is urging
“special consideration”; an American
envoy, Mr. Eugene V. Rostow, hope-
fully explained the curbs would be
“manageable.”
December produced a favorable trade
balance of $37 million after exports
at $244 million (November, $285 mil-
lion) and imports $207 million ($270
million); for the six months of 1967-68
to December the trade - deficit stands
at $34 million.
Fully assembled motor vehicles im-
ported into Australia between July and
November totalled 15,388, against
7954 for the corresponding period of
1966; Japanese vehicles prepondered,
with 11,848 (6363).
For the markets: Although
clearly affected by the American pro-
posal to reduce foreign capital in-
vestment, Australian share markets
looked more equable at the close.
London managed a small net ad-
vance, but post-devaluation concern is
expressed by small volumes ... A
late rally on Thursday was still help-
ing Wall Street to finish with a host
of (fractional) rises.
For companies: There’s no
American restriction so far as G.
J. Coles is concerned, for, with 49
percent interest, it is to join with the
S. S. Kresge Co. (51 percent) to estab-
lish K. Mart Australia Ltd., which will
operate large discount department
stores; the first, costing about sl£ mil-
lion, is to be built at East Burwood
(Vic.) . . . Also on the international
front, shoe-polish maker Kiwi earned
$1,227,745 (previously $1,255,038) in
the year to August, giving a 12.3 per-
cent earning rate; three months divi-
dend at If percent accords with the
full seven percent prospectus forecast.
Directors of Brownbuilt are appar-
ently looking “favorably” at John
Lysaght’s $11.6 million takeover bid,
while pondering, they advise share-
holders not to sell . . . W. A. haulage
and mining group, Bell Bros., is plan-
ning a premium issue of ordinaries to
take place before the end of March.
Sugar grower and miller Millaquin
predicts 1967-68 earnings at about the
previous year’s levels . . . N.S.W. mar-
garine maker Vegetable Oils Pty..
(owned by Allied Mills and Gillespie
Bros, through Mowbray Industries)
earned 40 percent more, at $445,424,
in 1966-67, bringing dividend from
$270,748 to $373,607 . . . Shellys-
Drinks slipped from $326,632 to
$265,614, yet held its 15 percent.
The still-developmental Juno mine
of Peko-Wallsend Investments gave a
district fillip to the group’s gold output
in the four weeks to December 19 . . .
Beach-sand miners Mineral Deposits
and Cudgen are each producing at high
levels.

DIARY
Getting back to
the good
buys for 1968
THE LAST WEEK has been a mag-
nificently lazy one. No working, no
writing, just sitting in the sun getting
fat and brown. What a life! No news-
papers, no memos, and no Stock Ex-
change prices. The only thing that
was important was the big one “out
the back.” It was a glorious existence
while it lasted. This week I’m back
behind the mahogany (actually it’s
three-ply with plastic veneer), working
hard at catching up with what’s hap-
pened. After having a quick run
through the papers, magazines, and odds
and ends that have been gathering dust
on my desk, and having had a run
through the Exchange lists, it seems
that there are still plenty of chances
of making a buck in 1968. Here are
some of the stocks that look good
buying under current conditions.
The first one is Mineral Deposits.
This stock made its floor debut on
December 14 at $4, a price that stag-
gered the old hands but which gave
the whole mining sector a much
appreciated (by concerned investors)
lift for Christmas. The fact that this
stock came on so strongly so early, in
what was a rather weak mining market,
indicates that its term potential was
readily appreciated. Remembering that
both Consolidated Goldfields and Ham-
ersly also came on at generally higher
than expected levels and then went on
to even greater heights, I’ve decided
that 400 Mineral Deposits at $3.75
would not be at all astray in the port-
folio. Also, the fact that the demand
for titanium metal (made from rutile)
for use in both commercial and mili-
tary aircraft is rocketing along almost
as fast as the planes themselves ic
another reason for wanting to be in
on this one.
The next bargain to hit my eye was
Long'*each Oil. Over the past few
weeks the stock has dipped from 80
cents down to 50 cents. It is now back
up to 57 cents. The drop was, of
course, in line with most other stocks
in the mining division. The severity
of it in this particular case was cer-
tainly unwarranted. Longreach has an
unusually bright year in front of it.
First is its 16 percent interest in the
unlisted company Hawkstone Oil.
This company, together with BP
(Australia), will soon spud-in their

first well on Gun Island off the
Western Australian coast. Interesting
developments could follow. Next are
Longreach’s copper and phosphate finds
in Queensland. The company has
negotiated with Clutha Development
for the assessment and development
(if feasible) of its phosphate discovery
and has a similar deal with the French
Pechiney company on the copper de-
posits. As a final investment sweetener,
the company has acquired some very
interesting leases through its takeover
of Austral Exploration Pty. Ltd. These
leases cover wide areas in the Northern
Territory, Queensland, and New South
Wales. They are known to be promising
areas for gold, copper, lead, and beach
sands (my old favorite) respectively.
Being sold on the company and its
prospects for ’6B, I bought 400.
The next company that looks good
is one I already hold, William Adams.
This company unexpectedly reported
an 8.7 percent fall in profit in the six
months to October 31, 1967. The
drought in Victoria and the water
restrictions in Tasmania were the cul-
prits. They affected the sales of Cater-
pillar tractors, for which the company
holds the franchise, in these areas.
However, the company’s second six
months should be better. As one of the
country’s major distributors of steel
and engineering supplies, the company
can be expected to benefit substantially
from the anticipated lift in fixed
capital expenditure. At $l.BB and
yielding 6.6 percent the shares look
a bargain.
Alcoa, for which William Adams
distributes aluminium, is also worth
a mention. This company has finally
made the profit lists and its first full
year’s profit is expected to be re-
leased in the next few months. The
word is that the turnabout from losses
to profits could be an eye-opener. There
are already rumours of a possible
dividend distribution. Although the
latter suggestion seems a bit premature
at this stage, it is still worth remem-
bering who the beneficiaries, will be
when dividends are in fact paid. They
are, of course, the three Collins House
companies, Western Mining, Broken
Hill South, and North Broken Hill.

AND STATISTICS
The U.S. restrictions on overseas investment initially arrested
a rising and active market, yet dealings were again steadying
toward the week’s close. Some of the big miners took the brunt
of the falls, these including Broken Hill South, $5.10 (down 22
cents), New Broken Hill, $8.20 (30 cents), CRA, $ll.OO (40
cents), Consolidated Gold, $6.47 (49 cents), and Hamersley,
$8.30 (40 cents). Mining, however, got considerable enliven-
ment from Peko, which leapt $1.12 to $7.50, companioned by
Mount Morgan’s gain of $1.30 to $7.80. Among the regulars,
BHP put on 15 cents and Western Mining 40 cents.

Diseases among dogs: a task
for extension services
EXCESSIVE VICIOUSNESS or ner-
vousness in dogs, as'Mrs. A. G. Rylah
has pointed out, is ofter caused by
people who do not know hew to train
or manage their charges. An additional
consideration has bean mentioned by the
authoritative American Veterinary
Medical Association. It believes that
breeding is frequently responsible for
abnormal temperament and has stated
that “. . . perhaps the most common
and most serious hereditary defects in
dogs are mental attributes that make
them unfit for work or as pets. While
such are quickly detected by those who
know and understand dogs, they are
usually not appreciated by the increas-
ing percentages of our population who
have had little contact with nature, and
who know little or nothing about ani-
mals.” No doubt much the same could
be said of the present situation in
Australia.
Some of our vets believe, for
instance, that the range of alsatian
blood stock in this country includes an
unusual degree of nervousness and
hence the proneness of dogs of this
breed to bite. In other countries the
alsatian is of a far more stable charac-
ter and truly qualifies to be numbered
among a man’s best friends. Queens-
land heelers and kelpies, Australia’s two
most important breeds, may also be
inclined to undue nervousness. Especi-
ally careful training by a knowledge-
able person could, of course, suppress
a natural disposition, but even in the
country the number of people who
really know dogs and have the patience
to teach them seem to be growing
fewer.
Sweden and the U.K. have schemes
for the elimination of genetical defects
in dogs. The Australian Veterinary As-
sociation established a committee sev-
eral months ago to ascertain the in-
cidence of a dozen different inherited
disorders, including temperament. If
some appear intolerably common
among the local breeds, control meas-
ures will be instituted here also through
the kennel clubs and breed societies.
This is obviously a commendable
plan, but it is more likely to be effective
among the fancy breeds and racing grey-
hounds than among working dogs, with
the exception of seeing-eye dogs. The
few vets practising in the country
would not see a representative number
of farm dogs. Besides, country people
do not tend to seek veterinary advice
concerning mere dogs. Their sheep and
cattle usually give them more than
enough to worry about. However, in-
stead of quietly destroying inferior pups
and dogs, it would be better to show
them to the local vet first so that he can
help in the compilation of records and
future plans for improving the blood
lines.
Apart from behavioural character-
istics, the commonest inherited or con-
genital afflictions to watch out for in
dogs are malformed joints, especially
dislocation of the hip. Poor night
vision, which is often an early warning
of a form of congenital blindness, is
another. Deafness of genetic origin
seems to be fairly common also, parti-
cularly among harlequin-patterned
types, which include the important
border collie.
Hydatid disease is another dog-man
relationship that is not sufficiently
appreciated. Despite the fact that the
cause and control of this disease has
been well known for very many years,
more people than ever before are con-
tracting it. The rate among country
people in New South Wales is now 7.6
cases per 100,000 of the population.
The rate among the uiban populace is
very much lower. About 10 percent
of the cases prove fatal. The last survey
found that 4 percent of urban dogs,
and every fourth dog in the country
carried the hydatid tapeworm. These
figures are identical with the findings
of a similar survey conducted in 1925,
which strongly suggests that each of
the three simple methods of control
have been completely ignored all these
years.
Such a situation must pose a huge
dilemma for the agricultural extension
services: have they failed because they
have not told enough people how to-
protect themselves, or have people dis-
missed the advice? Is the credibility
rating of Departments of Agriculture
extremely low? Or are people extreme
optimists rejecting precautions because
they believe that nasty things like
hydatids only happen to someone else?
It would seem that much of the new
moneys now available through the
Commonwealth Extension Services
grant should be used for research in
extension methods, organisation, and
effectiveness, rather than for expanding
existing programs or starting new ones.
This instance is only one of a long list
of failures or partial failures by the
extension services. Indeed, about the
only new developments that are quickly
and widely adopted are improved plant
varieties, particularly cereals, and new
pesticides, which are pressed on people
by the commercial interests.
whatever did become of the $6 million
extension grant? Perhaps our new Prime
Minister can smell it out.
To repeat: the three easy ways of
preventing the spread of hydatid dis-
ease are by (one) dosing sogs t 0 purge
them of worms, (two) refraining from
feeding sheep’s offal to dogs, or (three)
washing hands after handling dogs to
avoid transfering the tapeworm’s eggs
to the mouth during smoking or eating.
This last rule is probably difficult for
most adults to practice religiously and
almost impossible to enforce on chil-
dren, so either of the other two
methods offer the more reliable way.
The only new development in many
years affecting the control of hydatids
is the formulation of a more efficient
and safer drug for treating the dogs.
It is bunamidine hydrochloride.
Enough to clean out a sheep dog costs
about 60 cents. Dose the dog after
keeping it off" food for 24 hours. Three
hours later give it a feed, but keep it
chained for another 24 hours so that
its dropping, which will be highly con-
taminated with the tapeworm’s eggs,
can be gathered and burnt.


ARTS AND
ENTERTAINMENT
Art
Preserving the primitives
By ELWYN LYNN
THE PROVISION for a gallery of
primitive art of the South Pacific in
Canberra’s proposed National Gallery
raises a number of issues, chief among
them being whether there is enough
good art left in the islands or avail-
able elsewhere to fill it and whether it
should be more pedagogical than
aesthetic, more concerned with
ethnology, anthropology, and with
household and hunting artifacts than
with the beautiful and significant
image. (Those anthropologists who
think that the efficacy and purposes of
primitive art cannot be understood
apart from its natural environment and
tribal context, are no doubt correct,
but a cause-effect theory gives no
account of the work of art itself.)
In February, 1965, Professor W. E.
Stanner, of ANU, suggested that Can-
berra should have a Gallery of
Southern Man to reveal the enrich-
ment of our continent by the Abori-
gines a didactic museum, in fact
and his words stimulated a young
Adelaide architect, George Tetley, to
design such a gallery with emphasis on
scrupulous and exact scholarship, but
with displays calculated to arouse the
curiosity and stir the aesthetic impulses
of the general public. It has been sug-
gested that there is quite a role for
the Australian Institute of Aboriginal
Studies in such a gallery.
Until recently it has been the
aesthetic qualities of primitive art that
have interested collectors and scholars
like William Fagg, but just as fine art
is wilting under the gaze of the
historians, so is primitive art under that
of the anthropologists. I don’t intend
to argue the case for the presentation
of primitive art as aesthetic object,
but it is clear that while a museum can
reconstruct Whistler’s Peacock Room
and reproduce Gothic halls and
Chambers, as in New York’s Cloisters,
no convincing substitute for primitive
art’s environment, with which it is
integrated as no other, can be devised;
for example, Melanesian art, in dark
greys, dulled whites, ochres, and flat
brown-reds, can look positively funereal
in a European museum, but, on loca-
tion, decorated with bright grasses,
flowers, and feathers, it is frequently
quite gay.
Yet, the stress may have to be on
the pedagogical museum because, as
Stephen Kellner, the veteran dealer,
says, there are not enough excellent
pieces available; representative, yes, but
not enthralling. He says that Berlin’s
primitive Museum and it must be
recalled that Germans were collecting
before 1870 and that even a small
museum like Bremen’s Übersee has fine
pieces—has a collection superior to all
the Australian museums combined.
Museums and collectors will bid, he
says, eight to ten times Australian
prices for old and spectacular pieces at
Sotheby’s, and 'he and other dealers
stress the need for immediate action.
Senta Taft, of Galleries Primitive, and
Kellner urge the training and employ-
ment of an anthropologist with some
aesthetic discrimination all dealers
dwell on the aesthetic blindness of many
anthropologists to trace the history,
sources, and background of objects. The
Commonwealth is late in the field, but
State museums, through lack of funds,
are missing important pieces, which, by
law, have first to be offered to Aus-
tralian institutions; and, despite the
law, many fine examples are going
directly from New Guinea to foreiga
collections. The Native Art Gallery,
run by Robert Ypes, who, like Miss
Taft,, visits Melanesia, had to let a
rare Sepik canoe,' 14 feet long, with
three seated figures, go to the Alabama
Museum. In fact, foreign museums and
institutions like New York’s Primitive
Museum and those of Berlin and Basle
have their experts in the field; they
also buy from dealers and not always
didactic or museum pieces; Guiart, the
French expert and author of “Art of
the South Pacific” might buy a rare,
typical piece as an aesthetic curio.
Briefly, competition is at all levels. All
dealers send photographs abroad and
are approached by German, American,
Swiss, and Belgium museums and
private dealers, especially Americans.
In 1962 Kellner sold 500 attractive
works to the Stendahl Gallery of Los
Angeles; such is America’s hungry mar-
ket that Aboriginal bark paintings have
been “mass-produced”; reputable deal-
ers (like those of Madison Avenue) have
become wary, indeed. Robert Ypes sur-
mises that about 85 percent of Mela-
nesian art goes overseas. There is still
some good work available, says Senta
Taft, in the Southern Highlands of New
Guinea and on the West Irian border,
but there’s not much on the Sepik and
Fly Rivers, the Eastern and Western/
Highlands, New Britain, and the Huon
Sepik River pieces, recently exported
from Native Art Gallery, Potts Point. A
shield to Barcelona; debating stool to
Texas; mask to Los Angeles and
woven straw pig to Texas


Gulf. After six months in New Ire-
land, Mr. Ypes put on perhaps the last
good show from this area, which is
almost depleted.
Trained field-workers are needed not
only as collectors but also as correctors,
for, Senta Taft says, many museums,
especially American, supply confident
misinformation. This raises another
problem: a further source is the private
collections, many of which have no
provenance. Mr. Kellner tells a tale of
ancient, tattered Sepik masks being
burnt to tidy up a collection before he
inspected it. Senta Taft has issued a
series of News Sheets to educate owners
and collectors in the care and value of
their possessions. The large collections
are well documented Mr. Moriarty’s
in Sydney, Mrs. Carnegie’s in Holbrook,
and two important ones in New Guinea.
Some, like the mysterious one at Single-
ton, elude the eye of scholar and dealer.
Lack of documentation could devalue
much work because the art of the South
Pacific is fragile, goes back about 150
years and was made for tribes still in
existence. A comparison with Pre-
Columbian art, enduring and produced
over centuries, points up the need for
the care and documentation of South
Pacific artifacts. Still it’s their preser-
vation as works of art that is most
important.
Theatre
Medium and
tedium
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Bell, Book, and Candle. John van
Druten. St. Martin’s, Melbourne.
“NOWADAYS the theatre, possibly
because of the tedium which is its
constant concomitant, enjoys the
approval of the genteel aesthetic: it
is a rare play which manages to be
less tedious than the interminable in-
tervals which divide it. There is also
the relentless self-promoting skill of
the actors. If plays were as boring to
perform as they are to witness, the
theatre would vanish overnight. It .is
only on the rarest occasions that I
would not happily be translated from
attending a good play to seeing a
bad film.”
The author of that faint praise was
Frederic Raphael, novelist and screen-
writer (“Darling”). And while I can’t
but agree with the comments on
theatre, I think he’s being a little
rough on intervals. Intervals, to me,
are blessed oases without which the
deserts of drama would be unen-
durable. I’m quite sure that all theatre
has to do to flourish again is extend
the intervals and curtail the acts.
However, Raphael makes a more
serious point in regard to theatre and
cinema, a point which is sharpest of
all when one is looking at a play
which has previously been seen on
the screen.
As I remember, the film version of
“Bell, Book, and Candle” was some-
thing less than magic. But at least it
was filmed from the projected presence
of Jack Lemmon, Ernie Kovacs,
Hermione Gingold, and Kim Novak.
As well, it was unencumbered by the
stage’s continuity problems, and pared
the play of at least 30 irrelevant
minutes.
Producer Fairfax and his medium
are vastly disadvantaged in the in-
evitable comparisons. After all, on the
wide screen Kim Novak’s bust was
more expansive than Paul Kathner’s
entire setting. St. Martin’s leading lady
undoubtedly pulled some darling facial
expressions, but they were too remote
to be at all distinct. And where the
play was stage-struck in one room, the
film was able to meander prettily
through a dozen settings inside and out.
There are times, praise be, when
a small theatre can deliver a bigger
wallop than Cinerama: “Look Back in
Anger” and “Death of a Salesman.”
While the elements that contribute to
notable stage successes are elusive,
they do seem to share a situation where
emotions are intensified by an enclosed
or claustrophobic environment. In
other words, when a home or room
imposes an atmosphere, is itself one
of the characters, the stage can be
overpowering.
“Bell, Book, and Candle” seems to
me to belong to another category. It
is inoffensive, good-natured, pleasantly
acted, and competently produced, yet
it remains the sort of play that ulti-
mately devalues theatre. At this stage
of history, the stage must cut its losses
in the face of cinema and television
and try to define and concentrate
on the things that theatre does best.

Too much of a
good thing
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Doctor Dolittle. Director, Richard
Fleischer.
One Born Every Minute. Director,
Irvin Kershner.
Journey Out Of Darkness. Director,
James Trainor.
AS A CHILD I wasn’t a real fan of
the Dolittle books. They lacked the
quirkiness of Carroll, the bloodthirsti-
ness of the brothers Grimm, the improb-
able information packed into “The
Swiss Family Robinson.” Still, as I was
a totally uncritical reader and as I
owned a cousin who owned a Complete
Set, I got to know them tolerably well.
I haven’t consciously thought of them
for incalculable years, but apparently
they had a more pervasive influence
than I realised, for during the film
version I surprised myself by the fre-
quency of my thinking: “It wasn’t like
that in the book!”
Not that I felt any real sense of out-
rage when Hugh Lofting’s dumpy,
rotund Doctor appeared as the lean,
elegant Rex Harrison; when he actually
showed sexual interest in a pretty young
lady an interest shared by Matthew
Mugg the Cats-Aleat Man, who sur-
prisingly turned out to be Irish, and, in
the person of Anthony Newley, a good
deal more virile than the rather
shadowy character I remember.
I don’t feel strongly about any
changing-about of the Dolittle books,
but the adaptors haven’t substituted any
particular flavor or style of their own.
Trying to please everybody, they leave
us all dissatisfied. Children will enjoy
the Doctor’s knockabout adventures
with animals and native tribes, but will
be bored by the scenery and the senti-
mental, philosophic, and poetic inter-
ludes, while adults will probably react
in the opposite way. The one sequence
which should surely please everyone is
the circus bit, in which Richard Atten-
borough, pop-eyed from his first view
of the two-headed Pushmi-Pullyu, sings
“I’ve Never Seen Anything Like It In
Me Life!” with just the bounciness and
simplicity that ought to have inspired
the whole movie.
George C. Scott, who can do no
wrong as far as I’m concerned, makes
“One Born Every Minute” a funny and
curiously attractive film, considering
the extreme cynicism of its theme. He
plays an aging but still plausible con-
man, precariously keeping one jump
ahead of the law while he deftly uses
the honest citizen’s own greed and
avarice to bilk him. Director Irvin
Kershner, who has an obvious sympathy
for such off-beat characters, presents
this one affectionately, but unsentiment-
ally, whereas the solid citizens come out
of it badly, being shown as either dis-
honest or foolish.
It’s hard to feel too cast down about
the lack of an Australian feature-film
industry when you think of our few
recent productions the crashing
mediocrity of “They’re A Weird Mob”
(now getting yet another city release)
or the unbelievable amateurishness of
“Journey Out Of Darkness,” a sort of
outback Western dedicated to the praise-
worthy notion that all men are brothers
under the pancake make-up. An
American non-actor called Konrad
Matthaei appears as a policeman sent
from Mell Burn to Central Australia
there’s a cardboard cut-out of Ayers
Rock to prove it to arrest a tribal
killer (played with a sort of affable
astonishment by the Ceylonese
Kamahl). Ed Devereaux surprisingly
manages to bring good humor and dig-
nity to the role of the mission-educated
Aboriginal policeman.

Strong faith and hard cash
By JOHN McCALLUM
THE KEY to an Australian film indus-
try is, of course, distribution both here
and overseas. For many years American
and British producers simply were not
interested in making films outside their
own countries. As well, every major
studio had its own distributing organisa-
tion, and often its own exhibiting
organisation, too.
Television changed the situation.
Cinema audiences are now more de-
manding. Hollywood companies have
had to leave the studios and make
films all over the world to provide
different subjects and backgrounds.
Over the past few years, more films
have been made outside America by
American companies than in Holly-
wood. British companies have also been
far afield, particularly to Africa, some-
times to Australia. American companies
have also operated here sporadically
with films like “Kangaroo,” “On the
Beach,” “Smiley,” and “Summer of the
Seventeenth Doll.”
But these were not Australian films;
Mr. McCallum is joint chairman of
William-Powell International Films
they were foreign films made in Aus-
tralia for an overseas market for which
they had a guaranteed distribution.
Apart from the effort made by Ealing
in the 19405, there has been no attempt
to set up continuous production here.
The overseas company made the films
here, either because they had bought
the rights of a best-selling novel which
was set in Australia (“On the Beach”)
or simply because an overseas company
owned blocked funds in Australia and
decided that they might as well make
use of them by making a film here.
This is a very unsatisfactory state
of affairs. It is important to every
country to have a film industry of its
own and almost every country in the
world, except Australia, realises this
and has done something about it. Now
that overseas producers are looking at
Australia with new interest, conditions
for the local producer are unfortunately
much the same regarding distribution,
especially, ironically, in his own
country.
Because lack of overseas distribution
strangled Australian film production,
which had started so promisingly before
the 1914 war there was a time when
Australia produced more films than
America there were no local pro-
ducers to fight the local distributors
and exhibitors for a fair deal for their
product.
Without any local production, the
only interest in the film business for
Australians was to exhibit and distri-
bute films, and with no opposition from
producers they naturally moved in and
made as much as they could out of
these two businesses. They have made
millions of pounds since talkies took
over from live theatre in 1930 as the
most popular form of mass entertain-
ment, and the distribution and exhibi-
tion of films still is a very profitable
business. In films, Australia became
entrenched as a strong brick-and-mortar
business' (the exhibitor) and middle-
man business (the distributor). So much
so that Hollywood, and later England,
began giving attention to the tough
deals they were getting for their pro-
duct in Australia, and in order to pro-
tect themselves and get on the band-
wagon themselves as far as other
studios’ product was concerned, they
either bought into Australian distribu-
ting and exhibiting companies or
formed their own. Which still left the
Australian producer out on a limb.
Now and then energetic men like
Charles Chauvel and Ken Hall per-
suaded one of the two big circuits
which emerged to invest in a local


production. The efforts of these two
men in particular, one working inde-
pendently and the other with Cine-
sound, in addition to a few others, did
arouse hope that a permanent industry
could be established; permanent pro-
duction rather, the word “industry” has
always seemed to me altogether wrong
for film making. These films, for the
most part, were backed by the people
at the head of organisations here show-
ing films, to their great credit. Most of
them made money; Chauvel’s “Forty
Thousand Horsemen” had a consider-
able box-office success.
And then, sadly, investment policies
changed. Ealing Studios could not find
a local investor, despite local distribu-
tors and exhibitors being keen to handle
their product. Exhibitors saw television
looming and saw what it had done to
cinemas in the rest of the world. When
television came and cinemas had to fight
to survive, local production stood no
chance, and what spasmodic activity
there was ceased.
Cinemas here survived by shedding
weaker houses, especially in the suburbs,
making cinemas smaller and more inti-
mate, by improved film presentation,
and, above all, by producers making bet-
ter films.
It is the film which is responsible for
box-office success, not palatial cinemas
or distribution handling, and yet the
producers’ share of box-office takings
are far less than that of the exhibitor
and distributor. Of the $2 million which
"“They’re a Weird Mob” took at the
box office in Australia up to last
March, the exhibitor received approxi-
mately $1 million, the distributor re-
ceived approximately $350,000, there
were additional publicity and promo-
tion expenses of approximately
$lOO,OOO, and the producer was left
with $450,000 out of which he had to
pay further overhead expenses, such as
cost of all prints and a proportion of
publicity leaving just over $400,000. In
other words, the producer recovered
only two-thirds of the cost of the film;
"They’re a Weird Mob” cost $600,000
to make. These figures are approximate,
because exhibitors do not divulge
actual figures the producer receives
a statement of revenue after exhibition
costs and profits have been deducted;
they are considered none of the pro-
ducer’s business, although his film is
responsible for them. Exhibitor’s profit
is generally 30 percent of gross box-
office takings in Australia, distribution
charges are 35 percent or 40 percent
of the balance. The producer gets less
than 25 percent of the gross, a very
poor return for the grower of the
vegetable.
The justification for these enormous
charges by the exhibitor and distributor
is that not all films are successful, and
the successful ones must carry the un-
successful ones. Logical from their point
of view, perhaps, but a sour argument
from the point of view of the successful
producer, who has to shoulder such
onerous terms to support poor opposition
to his own efforts.
For the right to show his film, a
producer can fairly expect the man
who is going to show it (and be paid
handsomely for it) to make an advance
payment to help him to make the film,
just as an author receives advance
royalties from a publisher. Local ex-
hibitors and distributors thought it was
a splendid idea to make “They’re a
Weird Mob,” and were keen to have
the right to show it and circulate it,
but would not invest a penny in it,
just wished us all the luck in the world
and wanted first refusal to show it.
Even after the huge success of
“Weird Mob,” the position is exactly
the same for our next film: you make it
and we’ll show it
for you.
The Govern-
ment can do
something to help.
It cannot coerce
the big release
circuits to give
financial help to
local production
thank goodness
it cannot but
it can set up a
fund from which
local producers
can borrow for
what is known as
t h e “front”
money, that is, the
money needed to
buy a subject,
have it adapted
into a script,
interest a director
and star in it, and
generally set it up
for submission to
organisations who
are able and will-
ing to help in
financing it; over-
seas the people
who are willing to
do this are exhibi-
tors and distributors. It is an anomaly
that, at this moment, there is capital
available outside Australia from exhibi-
ting and distributing organisations for
Australian productions, but none avail-
able from the same organisations in
Australia; to make it stranger still, two
of. those overseas organisations have
large shareholding interests in their
counterparts here in Australia.. When
will we have faith in ourselves?
In order to help local productions,
many countries impose a levy on
cinema box-office takings. Britain does
this by the Eady plan, whereby the
money collected in this way, a small
amount on every ticket sold, is shared
out to films which qualify according
to their own success at the box office.
In addition to this, Britain has a
National Film Finance Corporation
from which producers can borrow for
approved projects, Sweden has a higher
levy on the box office, 10 percent, and
in consequence turns out a great many
films, which have world-wide release.
We are in a much better position,
being part of the English-speaking
world.
The Vincent Report recommended
that a fund should be set up to help
film production for cinema and tele-
vision showing in Australia. The re-
port is still waiting, after several years,
to be debated by Parliament. A sub-
mission to the Government for a Film
Development Fund has been made by
Williamson-Powell International Films
Pty. Ltd., the company which made
“They’re a Weird Mob,” supported by
seven important organisations including
the Australian Writers’ Guild, Actors’
Equity, the Musicians’ Union, Pro-
“Weird Mob” ... how the cake was sliced
ducers and Directors’ Guild, National
Catholic Radio and Television Centre,
and the Australian Film Producers’
Association.
Until such time as there is continuity
of production in Australia, a levy on
the box office would probably not be
justified, nor would a quota system.
But a lead should be given by the Gov-
ernment by the establishment of a
borrowing fund not a subsidy and
by the big cinema circuits having some
faith in local production.
We have national resources as good
as, if not better than, any country; we
have sufficient good actors and techni-
cians for the present and can train
more; we have a wealth of subject mat-
ter. All we need is a Government lead,
some faith from the local establishment
in the money-making side of exhibiting
and distributing films, and film produc-
tion in Australia will be on its feet,
running-shoes on.


When this bank says deliver,
you deliver.
It happened over lunch at Sardi's last year. First
National City Bank smiled at their intended Aus-
tralian partner, Waltons. "If we're going into this
thing, you deliver a Finance Corporation Secretary
who can deliver security". So Waltons delivered
Garth McFarlane —* an Australian financier with 25
years experience. Tough years for Australia when the
national demand for money kept men like Garth
worn thin. Now that FNCB-Waltons is a working
fact (assets grown to $7O million, shareholders'
funds to $lO million, list of investors to over 28,000)
you might feel that Garth McFarlane could take it
easy. But you know how it is. His team of invest-
ment officers has to deliver water-tight investment
security in every detail. Deliver it to our investors
today, tomorrow and through all the years of
growth that this country has ahead. And when a
guy like Garth McFarlane promises to deliver, he
delivers.

BOOKS
Non-policies from a
roomful of Tories
By PETER SAMUEL
Britain’s Withdrawal From Asia: Its
Implications for Australia. T. B. Mil-
lar (editor). ANU Press. $2.10.
THIS LITTLE BOOK a record of
a weekend seminar attended by selected
academics, journalists, and public ser-
vants in Canberra recently is an
account of how our foreign affairs
establishment protects itself against
ideas. It was not only the huge size
of the subject that made discussion at
the seminar uneven, rambling, and in-
conclusive, but also something in the
nature of the list of speakers.
However, the size of the subject was
itself a problem. It does, after all, in-
volve most aspects of Australia’s foreign
relations, hard work for a nice week-
end in Canberra. Clearly, in the time
available, the organisers would have
done better to have had far fewer and
more substantial papers (there were
ten). Some printed here are outstand-
ingly frivolous H. G. Gelber’s sug-
gesting that the British are not really
disengaging, J. D. B. Miller’s gentilities
on the need to consider foreign policies
other than All-the-way-with-LBJ (con-
cluding with “They may not comfort
us, but they do make us think,”) and
D. E. Kennedy’s parade of well-worn
points about SEATO which evoked, in
discussion, the priceless conclusion that
an alliance “less specifically opposed to
Communism might seem desirable, but
against whom would it be directed?”
There are several useful regional
papers. W. E. H. Stanner’s on “the
islands” reminds us that in our intense
concern about South-East Asia and the
application of the doctrine of forward
defence we are neglecting small but
potentially troublesome communities
closer to home. He avoids any simplis-
tic statements about Fiji being an Aus-
tralasian Cuba or Timor as another
West Irian, while pointing out that
these and other small communities
around us are very likely some time in
the next ten years to pose us substan-
tial foreign policy problems. They
simply cannot continue as they are, out
of trouble and the news. The dynamics
of economic development and political
awakening are heavily in process, and
it is high time we devoted even a small
part of our intellectual energies to
thinking how we might prevent or at
least anticipate some of the problems
which may arise. Do we want Portu-
gese Timor to proceed to independence,
or to Indonesia, or to a relationship
with an independent East New Guinea
or what? What sort of a line should
we have with the British on Fiji? What
is a possible constitutional evolution for
a community as sharply divided as
this? And how do we deal with our
own de facto representatives in the
Pacific a motley crew of conmen
and traders?
At present, these appear to be areas
in which Australia not only has no
policies but not even any ideas about
policies. Geoffrey Fairbairn does a
useful exercise in proceeding clock-
wise around the Indian Ocean from
Perth, reminding us of the intense un-
certainties of East Africa, the Middle
East, Ceylon, and Burma. Chinese
naval bases in Colombo and Rangoon
are not such remote contingencies.
Even without them eventuating, it
seems obvious that with the British
going from the Indian Ocean, the
Russians and the Chinese will be en-
couraged to increase their presence,,
and that our national interests dictate
some sort of counter-presence. Fair-
bairn suggests the feasible objective is
to develop a “local predominance”
around our north and west coasts, pre-
sumably continuing to expand our sub-
marine and anti-submarine strength,
bomber deterrence, and ground troop
credibility, the last by investing in an
appropriate airlift fleet so we can
promise an enemy to get several bat-
talions of Diggers on his back right
away should he try anything.
Denis Warner’s paper on potential
threats in South-East Asia in the next
decade is the really crucial positional
one. For all who seriously think about
defence it is axiomatic that while
hoping for the best, it is wise to pre-
pare for the worst. Warner gives us
plenty to prepare for more wars
of liberation whether the U.S. wins or
loses in Vietnam, dominoes falling,
hostages to a nuclear China, possible
collapses in the Philippines, Indonesia,
Thailand, Malaysia, Burma, indeed
everywhere. Chaos all around. It is a
characteristically pessimistic Warner
essay, plausible of course and in a
sense necessary as a statement of the
worst for which we must prepare. But
isn’t it rather silly as a statement of
what is likely, and defeatist as a pro-
position of what we have to defend our-
selves against?
Warner, the merchant of gloom, buys
his sorry wares only from our friends.
He is right to catalogue them, but his
readers may forget that our enemies
have a superfluity of shoddy and smelly
political merchandise. Singapore may
have employment problems, the Philip-
pines and Indonesia injustice and in-
efficiency on a grand scale, but nothing
to compare with the foul economic and
governmental mess of the grand “pro-
gressive” model, the People’s Republic
itself stricken by the Great Cultural
Revolution. The friends of our enemies,
the positive neutralists in Burma, Cam-
bodia, and Ceylon are hardly fetching
examples for the rapidly modernising
people of Taiwan, Thailand, and South
Korea. Rather the reverse.
And if recent history shows anything,
luck can fall our way as often as theirs:
as the suicide of the Indonesian Com-
munists proved so nicely.
If Warner neglects these sorts of
points he does conclude on a sensible
policy proposition, namely that the
Americans are increasingly observing"
the disproportionately small scale of
their allies’ commitments where they
presently count, in Vietnam. How is it,
Americans ask him, that you managed
to put four divisions into Europe in
1939-41 but can only find one brigade
for Vietnam?
This logically gets the matter to
where it should be seriously discussed.
What sort of military influence are we
capable of? And this is where the
seminar failed. It never managed to
mesh on the question of what magni-
tude of military influence we are cap-
able of exercising in our geographical
environment. In the report of the dis-
cussion I read cliche-ridden conversa-
tions I have often had with conserva-
tives who dominate our foreign affairs
establishment, whether employed in
universities or in the relevant depart-
ments in Canberra. The weary defeatist
platitudes pleasantly spoken over a beer
or in one of the many excellent Can-
berra restaurants are on record here:
“Too often it is assumed that there is a
paralysis of will by the planners; too
rarely is it realised that resources limit
commitments”; “We have created false
expectations among a whole range of
countries, we have entered commit-
ments we could not fulfil”; “In each of
the situations in which she is involved
in Asia, Australia is ultimately depend-
ent on others. She has little capacity
for independent initative . .
These excuses for a failure to think


• • ~ . , a
o> use the imagination are the deter-
nunants of our present non-pohc.es in
foreign affairs, and Dr. Millar does a
• . TT•
service in getting them in print. His
• , i • .. • •• , . ~
mistake was in not inviting alonv to his
seminar people who might have shaken
his conservatives a little in their rut. A
Santamaria, a Knopfelmacher, a Cook-
sey, a Colin Clark, or a Teichmann or
two were desperately needed. Peter
Robinson of the “Financial Review”
was one of the few present to challenge
the conventional economic wisdom of
the establishment that we can do no-
thing more. A productive debate needs
a team of people to insistently ask
what justification there is for Treasury’s
arithmetical doctrines, which seem to
infect and debilitate the thinking of the
whole external affairs and defence
establishment, namely that five percent
for defence and one percent for aid
represent a resource ceiling, which must
irrevocably determine the size of Aus-
tralia’s place in the world. Fairbairn is
far too deferential to people who talk
economics, and without his assistance
Robinson was evidently too lonely a
radical in a roomful of Tories.

only a few years ago, hawking his jokes
around the caverns and cupboards of
the old Bulletin building, looking like
a. character in an existentialist play
called “Waiting for Tanner,” who had
again received the message that Tan-
ner would definitely be in tomorrow.
Petty’s legend had already preceded
him. His jokes had often appeared in
the “New Yorker” and “Punch,” but
never in an Australian magazine; he
had worked for the “New Yorker,”
but never in an Australian publication
—except the “Age” at a time when it
was contemplating (that seems to
have been the word) introducing a
daily cartoon to its awesome pages:
Petty, according to the legend, was
tried out for a time and every day he
submitted a cartoon to the editor who
silently scrutinised it, then put it aside.
When no cartoon appeared for three
months Petty is reported to have
quietly withdrawn from the “Age’s”
employment.
The Bulletin, of course, accepted his
jokes. They were so funny. So he
immediately left behind a packet of
100 or so. (A fair sample of them are
in “The Bulletin Book. A Selection
from the ’Sixties.”) But little did The
Bulletin realise what it had done.
Petty immediately became popular;
and some old devil in him stirred. In
no time he became a daily cartoonist
for the Sydney “Mirror.” Then he
moved to Canberra to become a com-
mentator for the “Australian,” a sort
of black-and-white Douglas Brass.
Then the ABC made a documentary
about his philosophy of life. He was
invited to do covers for magazines
such as “Quadrant.” And now the great
Melbourne publishing house of F. W.
Cheshire has brought out a sumptuous
book of his satires on Australian life.
The jokesmith has become a sage, the
Wit has become a Reformer. Does he
still make us laugh as much? Or is
he becoming the resident flatterer of
the Trendy Left? Not entirely, but this
■ book shows a risk.
Not that Petty makes it easy for him-
self. He has revived a technique from
the more leisured days before the Great
War when Hop and others in The
Bulletin used to take a large page for
detailed and often minute comments on
one satiric theme, say, elections, the
police, or visiting x-oyalty. You had to
put aside 15 minutes to read Hop in
those days, especially because, like Petty
today, he told lots of his jokes in his
own obscure handwriting; and you had
to keep on going back to the page days
later to pick up one or two more com-
ments. Time will tell whether Petty’s
revival of this technique will catch on,
but the point is his pages are pretty solid
reading. And his squiggly style which
works in his one-joke-at-a-time cartoons
is less effective when there are a dozen
jokes on a page.
His themes are the familiar Petty
ones without much of the direct politics
of his daily cartoons. He starts with a
Digger cycling into Australia with a
tennis racquet in 1788 and ends with the
same character intoning “Nobody’s
going to tell me what to do” before,
with a scream of panic, he sees he is
cycling into a dark, unfamiliar world—
or is it over a precipice?—with a No
U Turn sign on it. In between he runs
through all the themes of self-indulgent
Australian life: greedy commerce,
fatuous bureaucracy, idiotic politicians,
conformist education, moronic satire,
pubs, poverty, expatriates, and so on.
He is classic Petty the scourge of the
times, rather than Petty the Wit and
jokesmith. The trouble is I keep seeing
all those cohorts of Petty fans clapping
with appreciation as they reach for their
pens to write for the original to stick
in the boardroom, surgery, or conver-
sation pit. Admittedly, any satirist runs
that risk; satire is doing good business:
Muggeridge likened the journalist to a
pianist in a brothel; nowadays, there
must also be a satirist. And Petty is our
leading “leftist” satirist.
Every page of the book also has some-
thing of the old Petty, Petty the joke-
smith, as well as Petty the sage. I only
wish they were a little easier to find.
But having said that I have to admit
I keep remembering Petty’s cyclist and
his last words: “Nobody’s going to tell
me ...”

The Cyclone. Miguel Angel Asturias.
Owen. $4.15.
PRIMITIVE, EARTHY pagan super-
stitions form the fascinating background
for both these works by the South
American Nobel Prize finalist Asturias.
The black sorcery of the “old” religion
supposedly conjures up “The Cyclone,”
which wreaks fearful retribution on the
banana plantations of Guatemala, while
the boiling wrath of the she-devil im-
prisoned in the mountain is responsible
for the catastrophic volcanic climax of
“The Mulatta and Mr. Fly.”
“The Cyclone” is written in fairly
conventional novel form with only brief
supernatural appearances of beguiling
sprites and occasional mermaids from
the encroaching sea. Here the theme is
big-business and the cornering and
creation of an artificial market by large
companies at the expense of the ignorant
growers. The author does not pull his
punches the peasants’ lot of squalor
and disease, seen against the eerie sibi-
lant green waves of the banana trees,
are graphically but unemotionally de-
tailed, not excluding descriptions of the
progressive stages of leprosy and similar
horrors. This is a powerful evocation

which would probably read even more
impressively in its original Spanish.
However, “The Mulatta and Mr. Fly”
will ultimately prove the more signifi-
cant of the two books. Here novelistic
conventions are thrown overboard as
Asturias plunges into the tangled under-
growth of ribald mythology and
assorted black-and-white magic. The
ancient Mayan beliefs meet the “new”
religion of Christianity in a head-on
collision, often with extraordinary
results. At one stage the Corn Devil,
Tazol, is imprisoned in a Cross as if in
some sort of superior safe-deposit. His
wily escape seems to symbolise the
power the old gods still retain over the
new in these parts.
Yumi, better known as Mr. Fly
because of his habit of leaving buttons
undone, and his simple wife become
involved in wizardry and witchcraft.
First, greed tempts Yumi to barter with
the Corn Devil, and later the couple
embark on a series of fantastic adven-
tures involving so much transmigration
and metamorphosis that it is often diffi-
cult to keep track zoologically.
Serious students should find this an
invaluable reference volume, because it
is apparently actual contemporary folk-
lore, not the reconstruction of some
misty saga of the past. Laymen may
spot links with the Chinese “Monkey”
tales, with the Edda, and even with our
own Aboriginal legends, with their
whirlwinds, feathered serpents, and
animate stones. Which proves nothing
except that people living close to the
soil evolve similar stories to explain the
all too unpredictable tantrums of
natural phenomena.
The translation must have been a
headache, and somehow only the last
chapters succeed in fully conveying a
sense of the rich dark poetry of the
language.
Citizen Cohn
By CHARLES HIGHAM
King Cohn. Bob Thomas. Barrie and
Rockliff. $5.30.
BEN HECHT CALLED him “White
Fang.” Elia Kazan said that he liked
to be “the biggest bug in the manure
pile.” Rosalind Russell said he had
“blind taste.” To most people, Harry
Cohn, creator and master of Columbia
Studios until' his death in 1958, was
nothing but a louse; this biography by
Bob Thomas of Associated Press is an
appropriately hard-bitten, racy, raw,
and vulgar account of his extra-
ordinary career.
First, the book succeeds in illuminat-
ing precisely what it takes to become
a successful entertainment mogul, a
Warner, a Mayer, a Laemmle: a back-
ground of humble origins, so that the
bad taste of most people is not only
perfectly understood but approved, a
contempt for artists and intellectuals,
a taste for board-room melodrama,
the ability to bully the brightest and
most concerned authors into providing
stories on the level of pulp fiction. And,
along with all the necessary Philistine
attributes, a flair for the cinema itself,
an ability to provide musicals, soap
operas, crime stories with the correct
packaging, knowing which star will
combine best with a given director,
which cameraman is needed to provide
the look of the film with a sufficient
amount of glamor. Above all, a fear-
some temper, the moods and savageries
of an ogre.
Cohn had all these qualities in
spades. He began as a trolley-car
conductor and a song-plugger, deliver-
ing numbers at a music counter in a
shaky tenor. He began in the picture
business by substituting movies plug-
ging songs for song-slides in theatres;
making one of these little pictures for
$25 he sold it to a producer for $2OO.
He was on his way.
Columbia began in the ’2os, a
period when America was enormously
the land of opportunity, when Jewish
kids from the East Side became direc-
tors and producers and stars overnight,
and Hollywood could be defined by
Dorothy Parker as a diamond-
braceleted woman chewing an apple.
Cohn started a policy of producing
slick mass-appeal comedies, and the
studio became known as “the port of
missing stars,” because he would
always have to hire the big names the
other film moguls had fired.
With these castoffs and a handful of
promising directors notably the
dynamic sentimentalist Frank Capra
Cohn weathered the dawn of sound and
developed Jean Arthur, a nervous and
chirrupy voiced ingenue, into the first-
magnitude star she remained for more
than a decade. He created a complex
studio spy system, and nobody’s life
was sacrosanct; he was violently rude
to writers; he had a special corridor
constructed, leading directly from his
office to the dressing-rooms of success-
ive female stars, and his sexual appe-
tites were limitless. He really got into
the big money during the great Dep-
ression, when “Forget Your Troubles
at a Movie” became the slogan of a
period, and Columbia became synony-
mous with Capra comedies, most not-
ably “It Happened One Night,” a
cheaply made programmer with Colbert
and Gable in which a bedroom scene
and a sing-song in a bus were the
most talked-about events of 1933.
Grace Moore, Irene Dunne, Loretta
Young: Cohn knew how to develop a
certain kind of dewy-eyed American
beauty, and his acumen paid dividends.
He committed blunders: Capra’s suc-
cess won him the right to make “Lost
Horizon,” a masterpiece of kitsch that
remains one of the director’s most
dazzling technical achievements: the
scenes in the icy wilderness of Tibet,
the flight from revolution and blood-
shed to a crash landing on a mountain-
side have not yet been surpassed for
special effects and for the simulation of

audiences laughed at Sam Jaffe as the
High Lama, chittering away in a shrill
voice at the age of 300-odd, and at
H. B. (“Jesus Christ”) Warner doing
a Fu Manchu in the halls of the palace
of Shangri La, and the picture lost
money.
In the ’40s, Cohn recovered, chiefly
through the exploitation of Rita Hay-
worth, and in Charles Vidor’s “Gilda”
she achieved her apotheosis. And when
her career inevitably foundered in the
’50s, he found a substitute: Kim
Novak, an actress with a strong physi-
cal allure, the hauteur of a well-tipped
waitress, and the acting technique of
a marshmallow sundae.
With his telephones at the dinner
table, habit of sending telegrams to
directors (HURRY UP, THE COST IS
STAGGERING, earned the reply SO
IS THE CAST), and screaming abuse
at female stars, Cohn — brilliantly cari-
catured in Clifford Odets’ “The Big
Knife”—lived to the hilt the role of
tycoon, and Thomas recalls his style
in a plethora of anecdotes, most
notably the one in which Cohn called
in an obscure secretary and told her
to point to any one of his executives
in the room: that man would be
instantly fired. When Cohn died it
was on a note of supreme irony: he
was baptised in the Christian faith,
because Mrs. Cohn reported that he
had “invoked the name of Jesus
Christ in his extremity.” One can
imagine in what terms, from the man
who could at the birth of his son slap
down a studio chief who toasted the
boy with “May he be just like his
father.” “Don’t ever say that!” Cohn
screamed. “I want my son to have
friends!”

Tyrrell's noble
Vat 9, spoken
for since birth
WE SET OUT to define what is known
as the Tyrrell style, a difficult task for
a number of reasons. Any style, in fact,
is hard to categorise exactly, but more
so today when it’s damned hard to get
together a group of wines for this kind
of tasting. Further complications are
that Tyrrells have only bottled their
own wine in recent years, and, when
they did start bottling instead of selling
in bulk, they ran into a nearly
calamitous succession of bad seasons.
In 1956, Dan Tyrrell, son of Edward
who founded the firm in the 1860 s, saw
his vineyards wiped out by hail in ten
minutes. Two years later, hail again
swept through the vineyards, and they
made three casks of wine from 35 acres.
In ’59 they got a half crop because of
the previous year’s damage, and Dan
dropped dead after the vintage in his
ninetieth year. Another bad hail year
in ’6O, and ’6l was light in quality and
low in quantity. It hailed again in ’62,
and Murray picked the fruit that was
missed before more hail could get it.
“We made two good casks and two of
rubbish,” he says. In ’63 he again
picked the grapes early to miss the hail
as soon as they were fit to make wine.
It wasn’t until 1964 that the fruit was
allowed to benefit fully from the good
season, and the general standard of red
wine made was high in both quantity
and quality.
So if you envy wine-makers their
present boom, never forget that they’ve
earned it.
Murray, Dan’s nephew, who returned
from the war in 1946 and helped make
the wine from that date, took over
completely upon Dan’s death and now
runs the place for the family company.
His mother, Dorothy, a charming lady
still vitally interested in wine, lives in
a house behind the winery next to the
New Vineyard, which was planted 40-
odd years ago when Murray was born.
Murray has extended the winery and
vineyards in recent years, and Tyrrell’s
is now of major importance in the Hun-
ter. True, the Hunter is only a spit in
the ocean of Australian wine, and of it
Tyrrell’s have even now only 100 acres
under vine. But these 100 acres are as


Linde man's
AUSTRALIA’S
GREATEST
PRIZE-WINNERS
important as the comparable holdings
of Chateau Tahbilk in Victoria or the
Mildara vineyards at Coonawarra. From
such areas and makers we get true, top
quality regional wines of Australia.
That is why we bother to try to
define style. In beginning the task, it
was immediately apparent that there
were many styles to judge. Of the
various years some had come from
private bottlings, some from other mer-
chants’ museum stocks, some from our
own cellars, and the remainder straight
from the cask. Obviously considerable
variation was to be expected. We got
it.
The ’4B was big and full with tremen-
dous balance and style. Will live for
years and still improve. The ’49 was
slightly volatile, but this helped lift
flavor. This was the most drinkable of
the older wines of these years. The ’5O
seemed full of pressings and was pretty
awful. Three different styles of wine.
The ’53 was light and pleasant and
very drinkable. The ’54 was magnifi-
cent, rich and full-flavored with a won-
derful nose and considerable finesse.
Easily the best of all the matured
wines. The ’55 was hard and thin, and
the ’56 (one of the few bottles made)
light and agreeable, but lacking body
and character.
The wines, ’57 to ’6l, provided much
food for thought. To start with, they
weren’t very good, and, more impor-
tantly, one couldn’t see them getting
much better. Enthusiastic cellar owners,
please note. Again and again I draw
to your attention the fact that all Aus-
tralian reds do not necessarily improve
with extended aging.
The ’57 was firm with quite good
flavor but considerable, rather hard,
tannin. Of the ’sBs, one was big and
slightly sweet and the other coarse
with harsh tannin. Both were un-
pleasant. The ’59 was dumb and a little
volatile, the ’6O hard and green, and
the ’6l light and inconsequential. Not
until we tasted the ’62 did a real wine
again emerge. This was the Vat 5 that
won a couple of Golds here and there.
Light, but with good flavor and soft
tannin and that definite Hunter earthy
quality. The whole well balanced. Both
nose and flavor developed considerably
in the glass. This came from grapes
grown on the old vines of the New
Vineyard and epitomises what is sup-
posed to be the Tyrrell style. Though
I don’t so suppose, myself.
Of the three ’63s I liked the Vat 11,
still light and of pleasant character,
but not up to the previous year. The
’64 Vat 11 was bigger and better
altogether. A floral nose, good fruit,
good flavor characteristics all in har-
mony, that elusive quality known as
balance, a wine that will improve for
another couple of years.
Then as the wines become younger,
so the style again changes. The big
years with little rain that have been
experienced recently impose their own
style. The wines become reminiscent of
some of those magnificent old Hunters
of the ’4os that Lindeman’s made,
wines that will still live for another
ten and 20 years. These wines needed
all sorts of age to reach full maturity,
and the top wines of Tyrrell’s of ’65
and ’66 are of the same calibre.
The Vats 14 and 12 that Murray
numbered by bottle are still a brilliant
ruby color and I shall not touch another
bottle for at least a couple of years.
Otherwise juvenile rape. Of that year
the Vats 5,7, and 11 are slightly lighter,
but still need further aging in the
bottle.
In 1966 the wines were even bigger.
Top casks were 67, 10, and 8, and these
are in bottle now and most have been
sold. The Vat 9 has always been the
pick of both Murray and me, and this
is still in cask. As with children of noble
Spanish birth, it is spoken for. And
there was a long line of suitors. Of the
lighter, quicker-appreciating wines, Vat
84 was lighter and had some agreeable
oak flavors, the 7 and 5 were consis-
tently good and the 11 the lightest of
all. Incidentally, the Vat 9 comes from
the same patch of vineyard as the
famous ’54.
Of the ’67s it is perhaps a little early
to judge. There is one obvious beauty,
the Vat 85, not as big as some of the
wines mentioned before but full of fine
flavor and character with a delightful
complexity of esters and ethers. I also
like the Vat 8 and Vat 9. These wines
are slightly lighter, more toward the
medium-bodied wines of 1964, but have
terrific flavor to compensate.
Murray persists with these Vat num-
bers. He thinks it adds extra interest for
all the visitors who pop up to see him
from Sydney. Of course, they are actu-
ally casks, and he corrects himself on
label discussions. One day I should like
to see just two or three wines of each
year. A blend of his top casks, his next
wines in a general blend, and the also-
rans, perhaps blended with wines of
other areas. And so stated on the label.
So I don’t know if we’ve got any-
where. It appears to me that when
Murray was allowed to get going by
the seasons he did produce a particu-
larly light style of Hunter for a couple
of years. But this was a matter of com-
mercial expediency. He simply couldn’t
afford to leave the grapes on the vine
to ripen completely because of the hail
risk. These wines developed quickly,
and this also suited a lot of his cus-
tomers.
But I believe that at that stage we
were still waiting for the best of Tyrrell.
We got it in ’65 and ’66, and we are
not far off it in ’67. The Vat 9 of ’66
is among the very best of the Hunter
reds of the past two or three years, and
Murray even believes it may be his top
red yet.
And it is not definably of Tyrrell
style. Rather, it is a top Hunter. Nature,
rather than the wine-maker, wins again.
Which does prove something, I suppose.
CONNOISSEUR
TABLE WINES
NOTES FROM LINDEMAN'S
CELLAR MANAGER:
There is no doubt that summer time
calls for white table wine. Served very-
chilled in hot weather it is the perfect
pre-luncheon or dinner beverage, as well
as matching all salads, seafoods and
most meat dishes.
From the wine makers’ point of view
dry white is the most difficult wine to
produce, that is quality wise. The natural
colour of most white grape juice is a
very pale, greenish tinted, fresh straw
colour, and our aim and ambition is to
retain this true colour in the final wine.
Unfortunately grape juice is readily
affected by air, in much the same way
as a cut apple. Exposed to air, the juice
quickly looses its green tint, and then
turns brown. At the same time the
finer, more delicate and subtle grape
flavours are also destroyed by oxidation,
so it is quite a truism that the quality
of a wine can be judged by its colour.
A cheap solution to the wine makers’
problem is to add a lot of sulphur
dioxide to the juice, as sulphur dioxide
has very strong antioxidation properties.
Our objection to this practice is the
unpleasant and unnatural flavour and
taste of sulphur dioxide itself, and, of
course, to the apparent loss of the natural
grape flavours in such treated juice and
wine. Avoidance of any contact with air
whatsoever is • Lindeman’s secret and
success in handling white grape juice
and wine, and although this involves us
in very great additional expense, it is
well worth the effort.
As discussed earlier “sterile” bottling
permits of the extremely early bottling
of white wines, reducing enormously the
period of time in which the bulk wine
could be exposed to air.
The below mentioned wines were all
bottled extremely early, and all retain
their green tinted colour and original
grape flavour.

LETTERS
Idea-less economists
Peter Samuel, in his article “Running
Australia by the seat of our pants”
(8., Dec. 9), renders a service by
indicating the ineptitude and unpre-
paredness of the Federal Cabinet and
Commonwealth officials in the recent
devaluation crisis.
But I consider he is off-beam in sug-
gesting this state of affairs can be
overcome by appointing more
“economists” to the Public Service.
Generally speaking, the thinking of
university-trained economists is con-
fined to text-book knowledge, and to
use Mr. Samuel’s phrase they are
“idea-less”; they are more suited to the
lecture room than the outside world
with its very practical problems.
This could explain perhaps why so
many graduates return as teachers, pre-
ferring to pass on to students the out-
moded theories they themselves have
imbibed, rather than face up to issues
as they really exist.
Their incompetence in the practical
field is exemplified in the case of the
1930 Depression. Professor Copland, a
well-known economist at the time, was
strongly against any credit expansion
to get Australia out of the doldrums,
and other economists backed him. Yet,
some years later, and this to his credit,
Copland admitted his policy was
wrong and that quite the reverse steps
should have been followed.
Again in the 1960 recession extend-
ing through to 1963, and which Mr.
Samuel wrongly attributes to the
financial and economic branch of the
Public Service, we get more evidence
of error by the economists. Rightly
speaking, this recession was imposed on
the country by the Reserve Bank Board,
headed by Dr. Coombs, who has been
acclaimed one of Australia’s “greatest
economists.” As Mr. Samuel points
out, this move by bankers and econo-
mists meant the loss of some $lOOO
million in production. Yet there is no
record whatever of any economist de-
nouncing this credit-restriction policy
when it was first announced.
Certainly we need a new approach
in our treatment of economic prob-
lems but, Heaven forbid, don’t let us
leave it to the “economists.” As one
of these gentlemen once retorted, when
asked why he did not offer any solution
to a problem: “It is not the economist’s
job to formulate policy, but rather to
observe trends.” I think that about
sums them up, theory—but no practice.

Questioning the Gallup Poll
The article on the Gallup Poll (8.,
Dec. 16) contained a glaring mistake,
namely, the claim that the outcome
of the May Nexus referendum was
“predicted with complete accuracy”
by the Gallup Poll organisation.
In the final week prior to the vote
on this referendum proposal the Gallup
Poll predicted a 60 percent NO vote,
but then went on to qualify this pre-
diction and to forecast that the result
would be a 55 percent NO vote. The
actual result was a 60 percent NO vote.
It is the final qualified forecast that
should be compared with the actual
result, and if this is done it is obvious
that a five percent difference does not
constitute a “completely accurate”
forecast.
The remarkable thing is that the
Gallup Poll organisation later issued
a statement in which it patted itself
on the back and claimed that the fore-
cast (which one?) on the Nexus ques-
tion had been accurate. No attempt
was made to explain why its three
qualifying arguments had apparently
been irrelevant to the actual result.
I have since wondered whether the
Gallup Poll organisation would have
been audacious enough to issue a
similar self-laudatory statement if the
actual result had been the same as the
final qualified forecast of 55 percent.

Singers of Australia
May I take this opportunity to com-
ment on the labelling as “poppycock”
Harold Rosenthal’s statement in his
Preface to “Singers of Australia” (8.,
Dec. 16). While it may be a bit start-
ling to read “most of the leading opera
houses of the world would be . . . very
hard put to perform certain operas if
it were not for the existence of Aus-
tralian singers,” this statement has a
sound basis of fact.
Last winter when Marie Collier was
appearing at the Metropolitan Opera
House in a new work “Mourning
Becomes Electra,” several feature
articles appeared in the New York
Press, pointing out the long search that
had been made to find a qualified
singer for the role of Lavinia, originally
written for a mezzo-soprano. When
none could be found it was decided
to rewrite the music for a dramatic
soprano and to engage Marie Collier,
who had already distinguished herself
in modern roles in San Francisco.
Fifteen years before, in March, 1952,
Neville Cardus had written in the
London “Sunday Herald”: “I am told
that it will not be possible for ‘Rosen-
kavalier’ to be presented in Man-
chester because Sylvia Fisher will not
be available on that particular date.
It seems hardly credible that nobody
in all England has been discovered
capable of acting as deputy for this
lovely Australian singer.”
These, two examples are cited here
to illustrate that truth is often stranger
than fiction, even in the operatic world
which Mr. Rosenthal knows so well. We
could cite others and note the unique
contribution made by John Brownlee’s
productions of French opera at the
Manhattan School of Music which have
made it possible for New Yorkers to
hear an opera like “Mireille” for the
first time in over forty years.

Nurses' future
Several nurses have drawn my Coun-
cil’s attention to certain statements in
the article “What of the Nurses’
Future” (8., Nov. 18). I have been
directed to write to you, expressing the
disgust of nurses generally in respect
of the article and its contents.
It is appreciated that the reporter
is merely recording the views of certain
persons interviewed, and it is indeed
unfortunate that many of the opinions
were obtained from persons who had
little respect for nurses and real con-
cern about the future of nursing. It
should be well known that for decades
nurses have labored to have improve-
ment in the courses offered for nursing
education, and the conditions under
which they work, to enable them to
give a high-quality service, but they
have met with the bitterest opposition
from many sources, and your article
does nothing to assist any current en-
deavors on the part of nurses to
improve the situation.

It was very heartening indeed to read
Dr. Rowan Nicks’ letter (8., Dec. 9):
The medical profession are the natural
spokesmen for the nursing profession
in their struggle for improved salaries
and conditions. Dr. Nicks has stated
that doctors, as well as patients, “are
dependent at all times on the integrity,
efficiency, training, discipline, and
understanding of the nurses.” This is
the truth, but it is very rarely that a
doctor will state it publicly.
The leading members of the medical
profession, those who are most closely
associated with public hospitals, know
the true extent of their reliance upon
the nursing profession. If these doctors
would speak with one voice in defence
of nurses’ claims they would be heard
with respect. They would also be
defending their own interests.
Many thanks to Miss A. Hersey for
writing an article which has stimulated
a useful correspondence. Whatever
doubt may be thrown on her facts,
she has performed a journalist’s
function.
