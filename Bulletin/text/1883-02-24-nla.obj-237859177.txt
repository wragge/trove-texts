“Tone It Down.”
The daily journals have been dreadfully shocked.
Mr. A. G. Taylor, the young “ senior ” member
for Mudgee, has lacerated their delicate suscepti-
bilities. The S.M. Herald gasped its dismay in
a leading article, 'ihe Evening News had a
burst of indignant morality in a “Mote of the
Day,” and while expressing its anxiety that such
exposures as Mr. Taylor made of his antagonist
should be suppressed, emphasized its moralizings
by publishing an account of the scene, copied,
without acknowledgment of course, from the
Herald, in a specially prominent style. The
miserable Daily Telegraph, as a matter of
habit, is always really shocked when anybody
else protends to be, and discovered in the exchange
of compliments between the members for JVludpee
a quite new reason why the Parkes-Eobertson
Ministry should have been permitted to blunder
and plunder to all eternity. Under such triple
guidance, the public is taught to shake its head
dolefully, to lament the decadence of Parlia-
mentary decorum, and to wonder lugubriously,
but vaguely, what things are coming to at all.
• • •
We are not a bit shocked. We hail Mr.
Taylor’s indifference to Podsnappery, and notice
the uncompromising vigour of his onslaughts,
with hearty acclamation. We declare that people
are getting too sensible to be much longer fooled
with the shadow of decency in lieu of the reality.
We are getting full up of all the fudge about
(Speaking in a Pickwickian sense. The Parliament
is the only place in this country where a man can
tell a crushing truth about frauds and impostors
•without bringing round him a pack of thieving
predatory lawyers scenting plunder. There is no
other place in N.S.W. where a man can lash a
scoundrel’s back without having that scoundrel
come back on him with a kindred crowd of harpies
and a bogus article labelled “ Justice/’ but really
being the cuckoo Law which has usurped the
place of justice, to make him rue his courage and
indiscretion. We hope Mr. Taylor will per-
severe, and do that methodically and of set pur-
pose which he did the other night seemingly on
impulse and under the spur of personal irritation.
Ho is gifted in an uncommon degree with the
faculty of expression. He has the fire and vigour
of youth. He is a new member, and as yet un-
shackled by state secrets of his own. Let him by
all means give the hot impulse of his young blood,
and the sounding current of his flowing periods, a
direction in which they will be of the most potent
service. The country needs just such a member.
The spice of recklessness with which Mr. Tay-
lor’s temperament is evidently seasoned can be
turned to good account. Ho has power. Let him
employ it to burst up ancient rings, to strip the
veneer of sham decorum from the mangy
backs of hoary humbugs, and to hold them up
naked and quivering, to public view, in their rea
characters.

“But,” cries an objector, “ were such scanda-
lous proceedings and attacks encouraged or per-
mitted, no man would enter public life.” Fudge !

science, and clean hands, to fear? A man’s real
reputation is not so delicate a plant that a breath

tike Jonah’s gourd. It embodies the observa-
tions and experiences of a host of people, who,
year after year, have observed him iu ever vary-
mg situations, and under tests and temptations of
constantly different character. The personal ex
periencea of the few, and their impressions, bo
come diffused abroad, till the fact that a man is

market place, that So and So had been ever the

the biting test. It is the fictitious patriot, the
fraudulent mouther of tinsel principles, the
secretly scoffing professor of a splendid self-
usnial, who tremble and shrink at the appearance

®cry tongue and an irresponsible audacity which
overleaps the sordid boundaries of self-interest

dent, he would be less likely to do the country a

interest/’ induced to put his Pegasus into harness

plunder. He could be brought to reason—squared
-and trusted to “stand in.” We rejoice in the
ehet that Mr. Taylor’s talent is altogether too
ranch for his common sense; and that, his impulse
ejng apparently to tell wholesome truths in parti-
'Cuiarly direot and striking language, he is likely
vo oe the slave of impulse to the end of the chapter.
Let him follow his inspirations by all moans, since
they are likely to do the country good service
* • «.
By the same journals which denounced Mr.
Taylor’s outburst, praise has been lavished on
Sir John KonERTSON for having the galleries
of the Assembly cleared, and thus preventing pub-
lication of the balance of the disclosures. Mr.
Buchanan had expatiated on the fact that Mr'
Taylor had been helplessly drunk in the House.
Sir John intervened at this moment. Was it
anxiety to preserve the dignitary of Parliamentary
institutions which prompted the old stager to
take action at this moment, as the Herald
suggests ?, Or was it a feverish anxiety lest Mr.
Tayloh might feel impelled to give the whole
circumstances of his misconduct? We hope Mr.
Taylor will yet do so, and make public the
name of the politician who, with another, plied
the young member with liquor, and, when they
had reduced him to a helpless condition, allowed
him to return to the Chamber! The public has a
right to know the truth about its public men,
and if Mr. Taylor will describes a few
more of them as they really are, his
impetuous oratory will do the State good service.
The influence of customary fiction has truly be-
come dangerous when the very Press shrieks in
consternation when by chance the public is
favoured with one glimpse of solid uncompro-
mising truth. There has been too much of
fraudulent pretence in our public affairs. Grimace
and insincerity become oppressive. It would be
a grand day for New South Wales when politicians
commenced to speak out all they know about
each other, and “ Honorable Members ” to favour
the country with their genuine impressions about
other Honorable Members. Par from discounte-
nancing such frankness, we, for our part, would
fain encourage it by every means in our power.
Let the country see the realities in lieu of the
apparent. Let it have its public men described
to them as they are with the lid lifted, and make
their choice with surer knowledge than they do
to-day.
contrary ; aad that whenever a gleam of truth
shoots through some casual rift caused by some-
body neglecting to mind his elbows, everybody is
to cry out at the clumsiness which occasioned the
fracture, and to rush with a plug,to stop the crevice.
Moreover, we believe that the professed leaders of
public opinion in the daily Press misconstrue the
temper of the public in this matter, What is it that
We venture to assert that the result of such
plain dealing in Parliament would not be to dete-
riorate the character of our Parliamentary insti-
tutions. We know half-a-dozen men now in
the Parliament, who, if Mr. Taylor would but
face the discomfort of telling all that is known of
them, would never again find a constituency so
insensible to , shame as to return them. And
these not small or inconsiderable men either.
There are men whose reputations so stink in the
place where they have spent their lives, that they
have to fly to remote places, whither their secret
history has not penetrated, to obtain a seat in
Parliament at all. Is it desirable that knowledge
of public men’s bad character should be sup-
pressed, and be only communicated by stealth and
in whispers ? Is the character of our legislative
institutions to be best preserved and sustained by
hollow pretences of accepting men as honorable
who are known to bo rotten in every relation of
life ? Or are these institutions to be maintained
pure and sound by substituting the real for the
fraudulent—honest’men for merely conventional
Honorable members ?
• • •
The argument of the dailies that these “ scan-
dalous ” exchanges of accusations are deplorable,
simply amounts to a contention that we should
keep on whitewashing our sepulchres although
their presence poisons the very air we breathe,
rather than frankly recognise their peetilential
nature and take steps to cleanse or remove them.
vVe protest against the dictum that wo are, like
the poor Marchioness with her “wine” of toast
and water, to “make believe very much” and
gravely accept antic posturings for grace, pro-
fessions for reality, in spite of convictions to the
has made Mr. M'Elhone the most powerful pri*
vato member in the Assembly and the most popular
with the constituencies, save his perpetual rupture
with the mook-proprieties P I)o they conceive
that the electors of Kast Sydney, for example, are
enamoured of Mr. M'Elhone’s coarseness, reck*
lessness, and vulgarity? JNever was there a more
complete error. Mr. M'Elhone stands where he
does despite of these qualities, which diminish
his acceptability a hundredfold. But for these,
he would be the chosen leader of the colony’s
afxairs. It is the strength of appreciation of his
other qualities alone which overcomes the dislike
which these earn for him. The public has learnt
some hard lessons under bitter teaching. It
begins to discriminate the real from the false, and
prefers a man in earnest, honest in his purposes,
and genuine in his hatred of fraud and imposture,
be he how rough ho may, to a sleek observer of
all the outward proprieties, who, while plausibly
reciting the loftiest sentiments in the most
felicitous manner at the exact right time, is per*
oeived to use these expedients merely as arts to
cloak a real worthlessness and rascality.
• • #
The public, we repeat, begins to see through
the disguise of mere formality and posturing, and
to understand that the most “proper" man is
not necessarily the safest to trust. The game of
conventionality is nearly played out. It will soon
bo exceedingly difficult for impostors to persuade
electors that, being themselves notoriously dis-
honest in their private dealings, they in their pub-
lic capacity burn with ardent love for all that is
honourable and upright. It will be hard to per-
suade them, for instance, that members of a
party which assumed virtuous airs on account of
having passed a stringent licensing law, who fill a
young man with liquor and push him forward to
his own exposure and infinite disgrace, are really
imbued with a deep anxiety for the cause of
temperance. It will be hard to persuade them
that Presbyterian parsons, who spit at each
other like wild oats, and bandy accusations
and epithets of “ ass,” are filled with the Holt
Ghost. Let us have the truth—as much of it as
we can get. And the last thing a public moralist
should do should be to look a gift horse of this
kind in the mouth.
Judges’ Salaries.
A good deal of downright touting has been carriec
on during the last few weeks among members 01
the Legislative Assembly by those interested i
having judicial salaries raised, and it is an ope
secret that a bill or bills will shortly be brough
forward to increase the salaries of the whole bene
from Sir Jambs Martin down to Chablh
Stuart Cansdell. We have already exprossec
a perfectly defined opinion relative to this matter
and we have seen, up to the present time, nc
reason to change our views. What the counter
pays to secure is justice. As a matter of fact, i
gets law. The essential question to be oonsideroc
when the subject of increasing the Judges’ salarie
is on the tapis, is: whether, by paying them mor
money, we shall get more justice or better law
The proposition carries its own contradiction oi
the face of it. It involves a presumption that the
Judges are at present in a degree on strike, anc
that they are giving bad measure or inferior
quality, while they hold in reserve fairer decisions
or more accurate judgments to be dealt out pro
vided they receive better remuneration. It is
clear, therefore, that no claim can be advanced oi
this ground, and that, if easier, cheaper, or bettei
law is desired, our investments must be made in
some other direction.
• • •
There is a second consideration, however. Are
the judges at present fairly remunerated accord*
ing to their abilities, when viewed in relation to
the market price of talent? We will take, first,
the Supreme Court Bench, The Chief Justice
receives £2G00 a year, 'ihe other judges draw
<£2000 apiece ; and when on circuit, they have, in
addition, handsome travelling allowances. With
reference to the Chief Justice, it may be admitted
in the present dearth of judicial ability in N.8.
Wales he is worth his money, so long as he does
his work. Ho has mad© notable, and ©ven pro-
digious, blunders ; but at least he is head and
shoulders above his associates. However, it is
his misfortune to be so frequently incapacitated
by illness, that to raise the salary for his behoof
would be absurd, and to raise it for the benefit of
his successor would be folly indeed, while it is so
extremely doubtful whether that successor may
not bo a Wisdom, or other small political bar-
rister chancing by political exigencies to hold
office as Attorney-General when the vacancy
occurs. The next judge is one who has dons good
work in his time, but now
Superfluous lags the veteran on the stage.
If his sense of what is decent is insufficient to
induce him to retire, it would be foolish indeed to
increase the pension he shuns. To do so would
simply be to offer an incentive to future judges to
linger on the Bench until they could secure an
increase of pension to suit their minds.

The next judge is a hardworking man, enthusi-
astic in the course of what he thinks is just, and not
above overruling the whole Supreme Court if it
suits his conception of absolute rectitude, but his
Wanders are much complained of, and we doubt
whether a more striking instance could be found
of misdirected energy and hard work than is
afforded by him. He is never adduced as an argu-
ment for increased salary. The next two judges
run in a sort of couple. They are both of an ago
that would be called young in England, not only
tm the Bench but even for a place of distinction
at the Bar. The question proposed is are they
worth more than .£2000 a year each P Would they
have made more by any other trade or profession?
Let those who know them, and who know also how
hard it is to make .£2000 a year by brainwork
without capital answer us.
• • »
lu England a barrister frequently resigns half
his income to become a judge—getting as an
equivalent the certainty of his income and the
increased dignity and respect he acquires. We
do not think either of these two judges resigned
much income to pain increased respect. We have
no doubt they will continue to do their duty as
judges, but we cannot fairly say that £12000 is an
inadequate compensation for their services.
• mm
We have now to turn to another very important
class of public servants, the District Court
Judges. Their pay is at present .£1000 a year,
and they say that it is too small a sum. We have
no doubt they think so. Everyone thinks his
income below his deserts, and certainly .£1000
does seem small in juxtaposition with Mr. Dow-
ling’s judicial acumen and long experience, or Mr.
Josephson’s love of work; but what of Mr.
Cansdell? It would be useful to know the
amount of income at the Bar Mr. Cansdell re-
signed to take up his present position, where,
supported by Mr. Tarlbton on one side, and Mr.
Colon na-Close on the other, he represents
Tuemis through the astonished circuit. Messrs.
Dowling and Murray are separately worth
more than Sir George Innbs, and ought to get
more. We doubt if any sum in reason would
ever tempt the best men at the Bar to the Bench
Some of them look forward unhampered to otium
cum dignitate in England or the Continent; some
drift into polities. The position has nothing so
alluring as the corresponding one in England,
where the Bench forms a perpetual corporation,
containing at any time for the last two centuries
some of the most eminent of living Englishmen,
and bearing now accumulated honours. In short,
if the country is to pay more for its judicial
Bench, it is clear that as the expenditure can have
no effect in raising the quality of our judges, it
should take the direction of increasing the quan-
tity. What is needed is speedy disposal of cases.
There are plenty of men at the Bar quite equal,
and even superior, to Sir George Innes or Mr.
Cansdell. If these two are good enough, so are
others. More judges, if necessary. But no higher
pay for indifferent work.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
“In Loving Remembrance."
The S M. Herald, a paper published daily at twopence,
aud edited by a clergyman, informs us that “ Bose is
back from Melbourne, 28 V Blank-street, Woolloomoo-
loo ” And this is from the Nooze Lady in White
Dress—Very sorry I could not keep appointment last
night, but will be there Friday night, 8 o'clock. Con-
fldential." Now, were we to publish such advertise,
incuts, the Judges of the Supreme Court would accuse
us of not printing our paper in the public interest.
However, the Herald of Saturday had a set-oif to the
above. In the Deaths column we read :—“ Luther. —
In loving remembrance of Martin Luther, who died
February 18, 1516, after having liberated millions of
Christians from a thraldom worse than Egyptian
bondage.’’ It has cost some fossil a crown to rake up
the bones of old Martin, who did a thing which no
decent man of the ago in which he lived would have
done—marry a nun. Luther was what a good many,
both of his followers and opponents, have been—a
fleshly man. Bring out your dead I Trot out yonr
corpses—and your ftve shillingses 1 Let us have a five-
bob loving remembrance of Pope Alexander, who was
such a loving father to his own Lucrktia I Let us have
a loving remembrance of all the Popes, in fact —and St.
Gkorok, the patron saint of fraudulent contractors —
and Judas Iscariot, aud old Father Adam. Let us
Australians have an invitation to weep over the memory
of Calvin, the Presbyterian demigod, who made such
a manly stand for liberty of conscience; and, while we
are about it, wo may as well drop a few tears over the
recollection of Servetus, the fellow whom ho burnt
for differing in opinion from him. Let us invite society
to lift up its voice and yowl in loving rememberance
of Archbishop Laud, and Clavkrhouse; and let ns
have a sob or so in memory of Judge Jefferies. Let us
drop some scalding tears in loving remembrance of
Ignatius Lotola, the founder of the Jesuits, and J.
Toequbmada, Esq., who used to pull out people’s toe-
nails and crack their joints and broil them in this
world; whereas Martin Luther, whom we are now
invited to hold in loving remembrance, only insisted
that everybody should be broiled in the next. In
shert—let us rake up loving remembrances of every
man whose memory is likely to be offensive aud painful
to some considerable body among our fellow citizens.
Mr Parnell and the Lands Office.
Mr. Farnbu, probably meant well, when, prompted
by an anonymous circular, he instituted a personal
inauiry into the alleged grievances of the clerks in the
Lands Department. Objection is sure ta be taken to
his having paid so much attention to an anonymous
document. There is a sentiment adverse to noticing
such things. That sentiment, we venture to affirm, is
sheer nonsense. Anonymous communications are,
under certain circumstances, the most pregnant of
warnings. The Government of Great Britain habitu-
ally pays earnest atteotion to them, and there seems
little reason to doubt that it is d ae to the action taken
in deference to an nymous warnings that Mr Forstkr,
the ex-Chlef Secretary of Ireland, did not fall a victim
to the daggers of aaanssins. The circumstances under
which anonymous letters are worthy of attention, are
tho»a lu which ordinary channels of communication are
artificially obstructed. This is Just the case in the
Civil Service. No subordinate can reach the Minister’s
ear by open representations, without incurring risks
which are sufficient to deter prudent men. The Civil
servant is regulated to death. He may not give infor-
mation to the press. He must not communicate
frankly with a member of Parliament. If he perceive
a whole system of maladministration and corruption
prevailing with the tacit acquiescence, if not the active
participation, of hia superior officers, he is under an
obligation to convey his discoveries to ths Minister
only by forwarding them, open, through the hands of,
it may be, the very men he has to impeach. The pre-
sumption being ever that the superior officer is mire
likely to be right than the in'erior, the chances of the
latter receiving justice are always small. He cannot
even feel confident that, provided his bona fide s ara
demonstrated, although his case be not fully maintained,
he will be protected against the rssentment of his
superior officer. A Permanent Head, or a permanent
superior of any grade, outlasts many Ministers; and
when the Minister who was seized of all the circum-
stances has quitted office, there is seldom much diffi-
culty in dealing some heavy blow, or severe mortifica-
tion, to the junior who has stirred up unpleasant
affairs. Mr. Parnell was, consequently, quite justi-
fied in taking action upon an anonymous communication
and in going personally into the affair. But for all
that his investigation has been a farcical fiasco. He
could not be expected to comprehend that one essential
was lacking to make his expedient effectual. That one
thing was that the clerks should have confidence in
his firmness and resolution, as well as in his good-inten-
tions. No man is a hero to his valet; Mr Parnell’s
defects of character are nowhere more exactly gauged,
he may be assured, than in the Lands Office. The clerks
won’t “ give themselves away” to a feeble and pliable
man, however well-meaning he may be. Make John
M’Elhone Minister, and the revelations would flow
readily enough, but for one thing. The officials while
appreciating his courage and thoroughness would doubt
his discretion. Mr. Parnell has not probed the mys-
teries of the Lands. He never will. The man and the
hour have yet to arrive In the mean time, in lieu of
a vague announcement to the effect that the employes
kept their own counsel when catechised, Mr Parnell
might give a categorical statement as to what he has
learned respecting the accuracy or falsity of the allega-
tions in the anonymous circular, taking for example one
definite statement, viz., “ that one of the senior officers
had appointed his own son sixteen years old to a posi-
tion in his own department, and after six months had
placed the boy in a position of trust, in which he had
as assistants a University graduate, and an LL.D.” The
real question is not at all whether the clerks are ,pr«.
pared to brave their supsrior officers on the strength
of the assurance of immunity offered by a notoriously
unstable man, but whether the a 1 legations are facts.
If they are, the Department must be filled with rotten-
ness and corruption from basement to finial, and a
strong man is needed to clear it out.
Moore Blackguardism.
From accounts received respecting tha assault by
Moore, the theatrical “ treasurer,” upou Alfred
Mode, the musical and dramatic critic of the Mel-
bourne Age, it is very evident that a brutal and cow-
ardly attack was made. Mr. Moul’b criticism was Just
severely true, and it is the business of a theatrical
critic to give the play-going public his honest opinion
as a guide for them iu their investment In entertain-
ments. Mr. Mode's strictures upon the offence of the
management in persistently thrusting Maggie Moore
into parts meant for prima donnas, and his remarks
upon the style—histrionic and vocal —which that ac-
tress imparts to her representations, commend them-
selves to everyone who has seen her in Opera Bouffe.
The burly ruffian, Moore, seems to have conceived that
a dramatic critic who cannot be squared must be in-
timidated ; and to make the intimidation effectual, he
fell upon Mr. Mode, apparently after taking precautions
that the latter should have no assistance. Moore is
an ex-publican—a thick-sot b’ackgaard of consider-
able physical strength. Mode is a small, slight,
and delicate man, who not long ago was on a
bed of sickness. He is a critic of genuine
ability, and a musician of considerable nmerit. No
one can wonder that his artistic susceptibilities
revolted at a representation of “La Mascotte" with
Maggie Moore as the heroine. The vocal exigencies
of the part can only be competently discharged by a
cultivated artist, and, lyrically considered, Maggie
Moore has no pretensions to be anything of the sort.
The blows of Moore, although they bruised only the
face and limbs of Mr. Mode, were, in reality, aimed at
the entire Press. Mr. Mode was evidently pitched
upon to be made an example of, because he dared to tell
the naked truth. The Press has been far too indulgent
to a certain mountebank section of the profession, and
they, like Joshdran s ass, are waxing fat and kicking,
while genuine artists who cultivate a capacity for
giving expression to tha conceptions, literary and lyric,
of genius, suffer corresponding neglect. The proper
retort by the entire Press of the colonies to Moore’s
ruffianism and intimidation would be to suspend its
habitual good nature and perpetual allowances, and, in
noticing performances by the crew to which Moore is
attached, to tell the naked truth without favour or
extenuation.
Candid!
Me. Andy Lynch, M L.A., said a wonderful thing in
the Assembly on Friday night. Keferring to the burn-
ing desire which consumes him to see the Licensing
Law relaxed, ho pronounced that the ex-Minister for
Justice might, but for his administration of the Act,
have been still in office. Mr. Ltnch has administered
an eye-opener to such as, like ourselves, were disposed to
believe that the late Ministry was ousted by a solid
vote of agrarian reformers. The apologists for the late
Government have insisted over and over again that the
fall of the Pabkks-Eobeetson Government was due
quite as much to the hostility of the beer interest as to a
revolt against corrupt administration, and a vicious land
policy. The candour of Mr. Lynch has shown that,
so fax as he is concerned, this representation of the
case is true The plain interpretation of his remark is
that, for his part, the late Government might have
continued their career of dissolute expenditure, might
have filled the Civil Service with incompetent hangers-
on and convicts newly released after serving a sentence
for theft while in the service, might have dissipated
the property of the public in bargains allotted to
Calico Jimmies, might have perpetuated an agrarian
system which was filling the country with a population
of perjurers, was dividing them into two hostile camps,
and was strangling the legitimate development of its
resources, and leading up to an inevitable catastrophe
All this they might have done, yet retained Mr.
Lynch’s confidence and support. But when they went
a step too far in restricting the inducements to intern-
perance, the great soul of Lynch was moved within
him, and he felt that he would be unfaithful to his
loftiest convictions did he not spurn them from office.
Among the numerous anomalies which in the public
service divide men into two classes—the men who are
paid fat mote than they are worth, and the men who
are worth more than they are paid, there is one which
presses hardly upon the police. When absent from
home, on duty, a money allowance is very properly
granted to policemen. An officer in charge of a district
receives £1 per night. An officer in charge of a sub-
district gets 12s., and a sergeant or constable gets 4s.
It seldom happens that an officer will start away with,
out taking on orderly to back him up and lend dignity
to his progress. And officers are rather fond of being
absent on duty, for reasons which will presently appear,
which render constables jnst as disinclined fcr such
expeditions. In many bush publics, only one grade of
accommodation is procurable and one scale of chargee.
The officer's £1 meets this scale very comfortably and
leaves a surplus of a few shillings, so that it pays
him to be absent on duty. Not so with the unlucky
sergeant or constable. His 4 s. places his pocket as far
on the debit side of the ledger as his officer's is on the
credit side. Taking 12s. as the average, the officer
pockets 8s. profit, and the constable is 8s. out of pocket.
As all complaints by policemen have to be made through
their superior officers, and be accompanied by the report
of these gentlemen, the chance that policemen have of
securing a reversal of these conditions may bo very well
understood, and tbe case is just one in which a Min-
ister might with advantage snap the bonds of red tape
and decide and act for himself.
+
When next a meeting of citizens is convened to consi-
der the propriety of giving a purse of money to a fol-
lower of Judas—no, it isn't Judas that is generally
mentioned —those responsible for the management of
the discussion will perhaps take care to control rowdies
who regard it as a fair “consideration” to hustle and
assault any speaker who expresses an opinion that
there would be no “ propriety” in giving a purse to a
man who has so'emuly sworn to live a life of poverty.
The assault upon Mr. Henry Edelman at the cut-and-
dried meeting to get up a purse for Archbishop Yauqhan
disgraced the whole affair and dirtied all the cheques
handed in. Dr. Vaughan will take with him simply
boot-money. Mr. Edelman would have shown more
discretion had he held his tongue and recognized the
fact that the announcement about “ considering tbe
propriety” was merely false pretences. But his
innocence in no way palliates the fact that a body of
“religious” jackals sat still and permitted art spectable
man to bo maltreated for making the mistake of taking
them at their word. Of course that was a tremendous
mistake.
♦
The challenge given by Mr. M'Blhone, and accepted
by Mr, A G. Taylor, in the Assembly on Tuesday
night, was a senseless affair. That two members
should resign their seats, and proceed to fight a
polling-booth duel in the electorate of one or other,
would do nothing for the country, and would involve it
in considerable unwarranted expense. As for the
debate in the course of which the challenge was given,
it was one of the most instructive with which the
country has been fav cured for years. Mr. Garrett on
Barbour was instructive; so was M'Elhone on
Garrett. The disclosures which are being obligingly
made by members about members will be of immense
use by and bye, and it is truly lamentable that the
Sydney Morning Herald persists in suppressing
information p’aced at the service of the constituencies.
When Mr. M'Elhone retorted finally on Mr. Garrett,
the Herald stifles his remarks by reporting merely
that “ He went on to refer to the hou member for
Camden." The hon. member for Camden is a very
interesting personage The slight descriptions given
of him in the preceding parts of the debate indicated
that he is a man worth investigating. Why, then,
should the principal channel of public information be
dammed ? To suppress such information as hon. mem-
bers vouchsafe about one another, is to play tbe game
of humbugs. But Mr. Taylor missed the mark alto-
gether on Tuesday night. A man doesn’t require to be
a born orator to interject!" You’re a liar.” Such fling-
ing about of epithets really does disgrace our Parlia-
mentary institutions. What is wanted is a logical
demonstration that a man is a liar, or a thief, or a
fraud, so that the electors may know all about it.
That would be useful. Slinging bad names is childish
and imbecile.
Barndm wanted some Australian blacks for exhibition
in America. He sent a man out here too capture the
necessary niggers Barnum's agent somehow or other
h _it wouldn’t be judicious perhaps to enquire to c'osely
I into the matter—got seven or eight wretched black.
I fellows from the Cardwell (Q ) district, and brought
' them to Sydney with the intention of shippiog them to
’Frisco by to-day's steamer. Two of the poor devils,
who can’t speak a word of English, ran away. Barnum’s
agent invoked the aid of the police, who went in search
of our countrymen and found them in the bush at
Manly, and, because they were naked, illegally arrested
them under the Vagrant Act, from the operation of
which blackfellows are specially exempted. One of
our countrymen didn’t give himself up to what was
neither law nor justice without a struggle. He
stabbed the policeman, and on Sunday morning last we
saw him bundled like a pig into the Manly steamer
with his hands ironed behind his back. Now
there is an Imperial Act, forbidding the exporta-
tion of blacks from Australia without the permis-
sion of the Governor. The m->il steimer leaves to-
day. We hope the Colonial Secretary will see that
these unfortunate blackfellows, six or seven more
of whom Mr. Barnum’s agent is understood to have
under lock and key in town, are not allowed to set
foot on board the mail boat. Oar Government, also
that of Queensland, has been moved in the matter.
Barnum's agent wants to make out that he got the
blacks from Port Darwin, not from Queensland. But
his story is a deal too thin.
...i . .
Mr. Howell, well known for years past in
Western Australia as a skilful counsel for defence in
criminal oases, died on Sunday night, at Perth, of in-
ternal hemorrhage.
Bernard Gilboy, the nautical crank who did the
long and solitary voyaee between ’Frisco and Queens-
land in a little boat, has recovered sufficiently to leave
Maryborough (Q.) hospital. He intends visiting all the
principal seaports in Australia, Tasmania, and perhaps
New Zealand, in his boat, and expects to be able to
start for Brisbane in about a fortnight. He is desoii bed
as an unassuming, single-minded man, of great intelli-
gence and information.
John Sargent, the mad caterer who assaulted
Cold Water Jug Munro some time back, is again to the
fore. He went to a ohurch at Kew, and beat time to
the music with a saw in one hand, and a pistol in tbe
ether. He then said the devil was his aunt, and re-
quested the clergyman to swallow the second lesson.
This Kew-rious conduct hai lod to a warrant being
granted for his arrest, so wo suppose Kew is whore Mr.
S will in future reside. No one present durirg his
extraordinary proceeding hid the presence of mind to
tell him not to “saw the air so much,” Perhaps,,ou
the whole, that’s lucky.

minced that the editor was once more double, the
whole office was surprised.

“ The Hon. I. Bligh’s feet are the latest sensa-
tion in Melbourne.’’—Victorian Paper.
Victoria, like most lands beneath the sky.
Six feet of earth allots to men who die;
Her liberal land laws also boldly give
Six hundred acres free to men who live ;
But were those feet sixfeet like thine, dear Bligb,
The dead might leave the living short supply.
W- H. Scotton, the Nottingham cricketer, has
been divorced from his wife It appears he married
when 21, at Derby, a pretty girl of 22, whom he grossly
jll-treded. So she applied for a divorce, and got one.
However, Mr. Scotton need not despair. There are
plenty more pretty young girls about; and nine-tenth's
of them will jump at a cricketer. The ogling that went
on at the great match suggested this to us. How many
modern tales of Beauty and the Beast were enacted
there ?
Prince Alfred wants to sell his reversionary
interest in the German Grand Duchy his Pa came from.
In fact, he wanted to, sema years ago, but Bismarck
would only give him a million, with a certain annuity.
Alfred thought that if political complications arose, the
Iron man might, politically, forget to pay the annuity,
bo be held out fora largo lump sum—some king less
ignoble than a paltry million. And ha wants it more
than ever now, he’s got boots and frocks and things to
buy. But Bismarck doesn’t see it.
One of the leaders of the Socialist party in
Berlin is Herr Viereck, an Assistant-judge of the Court
of Appeal aTld a very able writer on politics. His mother
was a dameuse at the Eoyal Opera House, and at the
time of his birth this lady was the recognised favourite
of the Emperor William, who sotlUd a very handsome
fortune upon the boy. Herr Viereck is none tbe less
an uncompromising Bepnblican. He is said to have a
much closer resemblance to the old Kaiser than has the
Crown Prince, and to be by far an abler man.
That holy thief, E. Russell Daunt, when last
beard of was cutting a fine dash in Shanghai and Hong-
kong. It may interest a few gentlemen of his kidney
who unfortunately still remain in our midst to hear
that Mr. Daunt has not been allowed to “revel in his
infamy,” as Mr. Harwood would say, for a full, true,
and particular account of his defalcations and abscond-
ing from here has been forwarded to all the banks and
principal mercantile firms in China and the East
generally.
Of Sergeant Ballantine, the eminent Englii-h
advocate, whose book "Experiences in the Life of a
Barri'ter," has been a huge success, and who is now in
New York, a local critic writes “ As a lecturer, the
venerable Sergeant will not please the American public,
but wo can afford to keep him here to tell stories, make
after-dinner speeches, and revive the pregnant scandals
of the last century. His speech at the Lambs’ dinner
contrasted curiously with the failure of his lecture at
Chickering Hall.”
The Earl of Deeart is now master of the hounds
in Kilkenny. A little while avo, he was master of
hardly anything but a salary on Vanity Pair (to which
ha used to contribute bad stories), and about £800 a
year. Added to this he had Lady Desart with £1500 a
year of her own, all of which she lavished ou jetines
pi xnliers. In tbe end, Lord D. caught her seriously
tripping, and a divorce was the result. The Earl then
wedded Mi«s Bisoholfsheim, daughter of the financier,
and got £131,000 a year with her. It was a marriage of
arrangement, of eourse. and it has conferred a boon
upon the public. It don’t get any more of Desart’s
stories. *’ Kelverdale ” was a crusher 1
Miss Marie Litton, the London actress, is dying.
She was formerly lessee of the Court Theatre, and was
sister ip-law to tbe late T. W. Bobertson, author of
“Caste,” &o. Miss Litton’s husband is Captain D. W.
Bobertson, a theatrical speculator, and he lost a large
amount of money through a pencliant his wife bad of
reviving old English comedies. Under her regime at the
Conrt. were produced Gilbert’s comedies, ‘‘Bandall’s
Thumb ” and •* On Guard ” ; his adaptation (a very bid
one) of “Great Expectations "; also "Creatures of
Impulse,” and “The Happy Land " Mtj. Bobertson
was a very pretty woman, and exceedingly high-toned.
Asanaotrees, she ranked, perhaps, nexe to Mro. Ban-
croft and Mrs. Kendall.
The Marcus Clarke memorial volume has been
got out of the usurious hands of the Melbourne
Hebrews. Poor Clarke's estate has been released by his
creditors, and oven the Shjlook of Melbourne signed.
It took him twelve hours to swallow the pill, but he
thought it better to aot as a Christian once in his life.
When the book does oome out—phew 1 By the way, a
French translation of Clarke's great and powerful
novel, “ His Natural Life," is being made in Paris for
the benefit of the nation in the matter of the convict
system of New Caledonia. It is expected hy tha traduc-
teur, who courteously wrote asking Mrs, Clarke’s leave
to translate the book, that it will make as big a sensa-
tion in France as it did across tha Bbiue when trans-
lated into German some years ago.
One of the Duke of Argyll’s daughters is about
to be married to Mr. Baillie-Hamiltou a “mechanical
musician,” who has invented something between a
harmonium and an organ. Two younger sons of the
Duke are in business. Lord Archibald Campbell was
sent to Morton, Blii s and Co. , a banking house at New
York, where he was put under the wing of Arthur
Chaplin—brother of the great racing-man—and learned
the ethics of banking. Both these young fellows re-
sided at tbe Travellers’ Club, amd were remarkable for
steadiness and application Mortou—Bliss's was a ve-y
recherchS banking-house indeed, the clerks being Daily
regaled with a i-.uaiptuoua luncheon at the expense of
the office, and “ swell” clerks being a speciality. One
of Wallaok’s sons was there, and a napnew ot Vander-
bilt. When wo last heard of Lord Campbell, ha was
a tea-broker in Mincing Lane.
We have received from a personal friend of Mr.
Charles Bright an account of the circumstances that
led to the divorce reported in a recent issue of The
Bulletin, Mr. Bright, as is well known, relinquished
a lucrative and influential appointment in Victoria in
order to devote his life and energies to the hard, and
comparatively ill-paid work of a Froethought Mis-
sionary .Lecturer. Mrs. Bright did not feel herself
called upon to make a corresponding sacrifice, and,
with her husband’s concurrence (though this is not
allowed by tho American law to appear in evidence),
obtained a legal sanction to the separation which had
actually existed for some years. To those who know
the purity of life and tho high standard of morality
of this talented lecturer, it is hardly necessary to adi
that-, in New York, incompatibility of sentiment is held
suffiaient justification for a divorce, without the least
imputation ot either cruelty or immorality to either
wife or husband.
In what tho Hekkee calls an “ Anecfcolal Pho-
tagrapb,” (I) quoted from Truth, we learn that Mr.
Fawcett, the English Postmaster-General. though quite
blind, enjoy* picturesque scenery " which he only sees
in his mental vision " Likewise, when a scene is par-
tially described to h'm, he ‘‘frequently completes the
picture with singular accuracy of detail.” Tbe public
has suffered a good long time from this kind of thing,
but still the dese is continually repeated. As a matter
of fact. Mr. Fawcett is as dependent upon outside aid,
and as hopelessly lost to all sense ot the beautiful in
nature, as any other blind man; and, therefore, all the
foregoing is only a splendid piece of reportorial imagi-
nation It is only a Shroud man, writing the biography
of a market gardener, with a case of peaches in the
dim perspective, who oould equal this. We feel in-
clined to repeat Mark Twain’s words, after hearing the
guide's story of the “Iron Hook” —dpkudid legend—
splendid lie.”
So the Belt case ia to be tried over again, and,
therefore, a plentiful shower of thumpers may bo eon-
fldently looked for. Labouohere says that he “ should
not have regarded it as a case for heavy damages," and
sides with the Academicians, whose theory ia that it
docs not follow that if a bust Is like the original it is
artistic." To people not in the trade this dictum seems
peculiar. It did to the jury, too. Perhaps the latter ia
now beginning to wish he hadn’t become famous, and
risen from a poor effloe-boy to be a big sculptor. He is
paying tho penalty of greatness. Alfred has bad to pay
it. too When Lotti Wilmott got £2(KI out of him, the
gifted journalist said he must expect that, running two
powerful organs. Then be nearly wished ha wasn't
great in the land j and, as he signed the cheque. looked
musingly back on the times wbeu he used to run about
all the week getting " answers to correspondents," and
used to play Chris, hockey in the evenings with two
pine battens and the heel of an old boot.
Judge Maofarland ia more successful as a
gallant than as a lecturer His discourse on ” Ana-
tralian Discovery,” in behalf of the Danieby Fund,
didn’t come off. There was no one to hear it —on two
occasions So his Honor found vent in tho columns of
the Herald. And it is a strange thing, that in the only
part of his lecture where ho ” dropped into poetry,” he
went wrong. He pictured “ Tasman, in the spirit of
chivalry and romance, calling the Tight Little Island
after the fair, arvelic. and sylphlike consort of his
generous patron, Van Dieman " The judge will learn
with regret that tho angel’s name was “ Maria"—pro-
nounced “Marier." And instead of being a fair,
angelic, pylphlike, and ideal lady-love, she was simply a
typical Dutch housewife—a genuine pickled female
cucumber. We’ve seen her portrait in Henniker
Heaton’s collection. Will Judge Maofarland get a

People didn’t seem to care, here, much when
Arthur Skotchley’s death was announced, although we
lowered him gently down with a nice par. But it
appears a very great deal was thought of him in Lon-
don. During hi« life he acquired a ridiculous idea that
it was a goodly thing to do to strive and soothe the last
hours of the dying. People, of course, thought him
mad, when they saw him carrying out this absurd
notion. Whoever heard of such a thing? Well, he
died, himself, at 66. and when they sang a requiem for
him, the Church in Spanish Place was besieged by a
crowd of poor, weeping people, whose wants he had
relieved or whose friends he had minivtored to When
a member of the Church of England, George Bose was
curate to Clement Scott’s father, but on going over to
the Church of Borne, he became tutor to the Duke of
Norfolk. This appointment he relinquished to adopt
tbe career of an entertainer and litterateur His coffin
wasfol'owed bv the Duke of Norfolk, W. S. Gilbert,
J. L. Toole, Clement Scott, Arthur A’Beckett, and

Sir Arthur Gordon, 6.C.M.G , Governor of New
Zealand, was by no means popular with the Eoyal
Navv when His Excellency was Governor of Fiji.
While cruising about is one of Her Majesty’s ships
his relations with the captain wore, to say the least of
it. strained. The captain, therefore, determined to pay
him out, a”d he did so, according to a London paper, as
follows :—Sir Arthur was in tbe habit, of going ashore
early in tho morning, in a deshabille suited to his
errand, to have a bathe in one of tho streams flowing
into the sea. His garb consisted of a pair of loose
slippers, an old pair of trousers, a shirt, and a very
unofficial hat. One morning on reaching the top of the
companion-ladder on his return from his al fresco tub.
he to his dismay, found the yards manned, sidesmen
present, the captain ready to receive, and heard the
word of command, “Look aft " He felt himself to bo
in by no means a condition to bo thus honoured and
“looked aft" at, so enquired the reason of all this
elaborate ceremonial. Tho Captain calmly replied that
all ceremonies and compliments commenced at 8 a m.,
and that it was then past that hour. The Governor did
not love the captain more for his politeness.
Pome mad bard wrote an absurd ballad once, in
which a Duke falls in love with a circus dauoing-girl,
aad having out out the clown of the show says—
“ You parti-colour’d snob now hear
She's ta’eu from out your clutches 1
This little dancing girl will be
A little dancing Duchess.”
Well, this is likely to take place in real life, since
Colonel Wellesley, ih° heir presumptive of the Duke of
Wellington (who is 70 and childless—but you never
know !), has announced his intoution of marrying Kate
Vaughan. Kate is very pretty ; can sing a little, act a
little and dance a greal deal. But she is frail. She
was 11 under the protection of a member of the aristoo-
ncy" wbeu Wel'esly made her acquaintance. At that
time the Earl of Lonsdale was “ spooney” on Connie Gil-
christ., of the same giddy theatre, and she was nightly
wearing the Lonsdale family diamonds ! I I Colonel
Wellesley is described as being a magnificent-looking
fellow, “an almost faultless specimen of English manly
beauty.” He is also a fine specimen of a well-bred
English blackguard.
Tha “Celebrities at Home” racket, in the London
World, is getting “ played out.” The latest is Mr.
“ Edward Lawson” (whoso other name is Levy), and it
is difficult to decide, from a perusal of the article,
which is the bigger snob —Mr. Edward Lawson, of Hall
Barn, or the man who wrote the reclame When the
reportorial fluukev has done a lubrication of his host,
he mentions that Mr. Lawson adheres to a rule of hay-
ing neither artists nor writers down at Hall Barn —one
painter only being allowed on the premises “ merely in
his capacity as a oraok shot 11!’’ But hear this pro-
fessional fereaser: —“ In his company, as in his house,
Mr. Lawson adheres to his doctrine that, after the
middle term of life, if it be still held worth living, the
venue must be changed in place, thought, and surround-
ings There is not the faintest tinge of Fleet-stroet in
tho oompanv present, f! I] A country baronet and
M P , and a Buckinghamshire squire, a mighty Nimrod,
stand »t one end of the table smoking cigarettes, &o.
. . . The artist and crack shot is soothing himself with
tea ; another famous game-shot and quondam University
athlete is drinking a glass of particularly dry
sherry; [111] a representative ot the Foreign Office
is smoking a dry (sic) pipe; and politics, pheasants,
crops, pigeon-shooting, the Liverpool Cup, and ground
game are all discussed; but there is not a word
said about Mr. Tennyson’s play or any other literary
subject.” But —we quote him now again“ If
artists and writers are not allowed to accumulate at
Hall Barn, there is at least no want of books and
pictures.” There are some by Marcus Stone and one
by Solomon—probably a near relation of tbe Hebraic
Lord of the Manor; and there is tho dogger that Burke
threw down on the floor of the House of Commons—an
artiole of vertu, which had most likely been pawned
wilh Mr. Lawson’s ancestors by one of the great
Edmund’s poor relations. In changing his name from
Low to Lawson. Mr. L. has followed the example set
by Moses, of Moses and Son, the slop-sellers, who
changed their names to Marsden, and took a big man-
sion in Kensington Palace Gardens. Mr. Lawson’s
town house is in Arlington-street, Piccadilly, and there,
at least, it would seem, humble authors and poor
painters are admitted. The whole article, which ia
pitifully written, might, but for its sound grammatical
construction, be mistaken for the effusion of a hungry
Bum reporter on having interviewed a likely mark for
an ad., and been admitted to dine with the butler.
Either Edmund Yates (author, too, of that wonderful
novel, ‘‘Black is drivelling in his old ago, or
someone of the Mortimer Franklin kidney is conduct-
ing the paper Nothing else would account for the
introduction of such impudent slobber, such unblushing
servility as that from which wo have quoted.
Writes our local correspondent;—Tho agent of
the Irish National League created a most favourable
impression in Adelaide. No better propagandist of the
views held by this body could well be imagined. Though
but flve and-twenty, J. E. Bedim ud is a polished
orator His voice is not over-powerful, but syropa.
thetic-in tone, and ihost admirably used and husbanded.
Of medium height only, slim build, and generally re-
fined personality, Mr. Kedmnnd probably fails to out.
ward I y realise tbe popular idea of an influential Irish
agitator. But if a massive jaw is any voucher for
determination, and a broad brow a trustworthy index of
intellect, ha possesses these fine qualities in abundance.
Imagine Frank Grey Smith, the Melbourne bank man,
deprived of corpulent signs; reduced in width, say. two
sizes; with that chin of his especially ethorialised,
and a good notion of J. E. Kedmond’s individualism
would be obtained. Eedinond uses groat method in his
public speaking. There is no undue haste, every sen-
tence seems to have been weightily considered, there
are no distressing transpositions, every word is in its
proper place, and the construction of an entire speech
grammatically and expressively perfect. Hie diction is
certainly slightly ornate, hut the whole arrangement of
his sentences is exceedingly clever and most pleasant
in actual effect. Mr. Bedmond’s enunciation is distinct,
without any apparent effort, and a pattern for histrions.
He is always in earnest, frequently argumentative,
and not seldom impassioned. Yet whatever be the
mood, and though the speaker is obviously permeated
by bis subject, never ones is that subject allowed to
usurp control. There is scarcely a trace of brogue or
Hibernian accent —the shibboleth “will" for “shall”
only betraying Mr. Bedmond’s Kclticism. No doubt he
delivers the message of the Irish National League in,
for the most part, fitting terms. But, in the opinion of
conventional thinkers, J. E. Redmond sadly discounts
its moral effect by the exhibition of an acridly expressed
feeling of hostility to the British Cabinet. At twenty-
five one says many things which one would fain forget
at forty. J. E. Bedmond will incontestably find himself
in this position, notwithstanding that the programme
proclaimed by him having been formulated by his chiefs
he occupies surer ground than tho turgid enthusiasm of
his youth oould afford. Viewed merely as oratorical
displays, J. E Redmond's utterances are stimulating,
suggestive, deeply interesting, perfect in their art, and
possibly unique. Had William Bedmond lived in the
reign of James I his name would probably have been
handed down to execrating posterity in place of that, of
Guido Fawkes. William is a pallid, sensitive, unhealthy
youth, who resembles a ‘esuscitated corpse as
as much as anything He ia in uo condition,
mentally or physically, to address an illogical crowd,
and will most surely, in Australia, damage the cause he
seeks to represent. We understand ho is not an
accredited agent of the League. Having bean impri-
soned for treasonable speeches, William Eedmond’s
virulent denunciations strike the bearer as the outcome
of rancorous personal epite. Nothing that he does
removes this impression. Ho is throughout, iu all
reasonable points, but the echo of his brother : and,
otherwise, only venomous and vindictive. Irish friends
have advised him that America and not Australia must
be his “ field of action." They are right. Some people
have gone so far as to say that William Bedmond is a
revolutionary monomaniac, who needs restraint. Any-
way, he had far better have remained ia the silence
which is golden, until his health is restored and his

William Bedmond speaks in a thick, unpleasant voice,
with a strong, uncouth Milesian brogue. He is a
master of olap-trap.
Down the main street of a town in the Western
States of America, strides a tall, slim-figured man with
the stride cf a mountaineer. The passing stranger
looks long at him as one looks who sees something not
seen twice in an average day. The subject of his
scrutiny is certainly no ordinary man. He has a strik-
ing face, high forehead, high cheek bones, large clear
eyes and long looks of tawny hair that fall down.to his
shoulders. Should the stranger ask the name of this
peculiar looking personage, he will be told that it is
Joaquin Miller. Joaquin Miller, poet and horse stealer.
Joaquin Miller, whom Dante Gabriel Bossetti. whose
body is now dust, and his soul with the saints we trust
—though having been a poet himself in the days of his
flesh, he has no busfness in such company,—placed in
the foremost rank of the singers of America. Long before
this picturesque highwayman rode roughshod over the
rqlca of versification, and cleared at a bound tha wall
that hems in the little parterres of poetry from the pro-
fare world outside, he had been hunting bison on the
prairies and fighting side by side with the red man. and
ags nst his own countrymen in the Modoc War. While
a m mber of this tribe he took to himself two Indian
wiv s. His nurse has been an Indian maiden, and his
Peg a-ns a wild mustang ever since. But ho got tired of
the Modoos in time and returned to civilization. Ha
returned with a string of horses belonging to somebody
els<, which he had picked up on the way and taken along
witu him to keep him company. Forthisa sordid judge,
who could not sympathise with the fine free humour of
the prairies, sent him to gaol. After this he turned his
attention to the cultivation of immortal verse. He
wrote a number of powerful poems which were power-
fully rejected by American publishers. But such a
trifle as this oould not daunt a man who had been with
Walker in Nicaragua. He took his poems to London,
where they were not only published, but made an im-
mediate sensation in the literary world. It followed
as a matter of course that he was lionised. His past
history only lent piquancy to his present fame. Thence-
forth he was known as “ the Poet of the Sierras."
Subsequently he married two white women —one of
them very beautiful. To do him justice, ho did not
marry the second until he had been divorced from the
first Both of those wives were a bit eccentric. One
of them wrote a book of poems of the very unspeakably
atrocious kind, and the other spent all her spare time
in inventing a mysterious machine that was going to
revolutionise something, though nobody knew what.
In fact, Joaquin and all connected with him wore
looked upon as “ cranks.” His daughter, a lovely girl,
wont to the devil. His own countrymen—the Oregon-
ians—have a hearty hatred of him which is beautiful to
see. They are quiet, steady people, who don’t want
any long-haired poetry men swaggering about in their
streets anyhow. And the more pretentious society of
the Pacific coast will not admit him into its salons
because of his notorious immorality. It la not good to
be a poet in these days — unless one happens to be also
a doctor of divinity or a lay-preaoher.

Mr. Frank Cates, a very charming young actor,
who is much esteemed iu society on aooount of having
a Duke for his aunt, writes: us on the subject of Gilbert
and Sullivan’s first work, which we alluded to in “ Per-
sonal” some few numbers ago. Prank agrees with us
that “ Thespis" was wondrously whimsical, and 1s
obliging enough to send us Toole’s song in it about the
railway train and the generous director. This magnate
presented, every year, gifts ali round to the railway
servants—for instance —
" On Christmas Day, he gave each stoker
A brand new shovel and silver poker."
However, notwithstanding his generosity, dissatisfac-
tion set in somehow, as will be seen by the following :—
“ But, at last, there began to spread a rumour
That he'did all this from a s nse of humour;
So the men, instead of driving and stoking,
Went in for a course of practical joking;
And whenever they found that ho was riding.
They shunted his train on a lovely tiding,
Or else pulled up in the middlo ot a tunnel.
And told him that the boiler was a-comiug thro’ the
funnel."
• * «
We may remark that, considering that Frank
is a member of the aristocracy, he writes a rcmaikably
good hand, and is the only relation of a Duke we ever
knew who spelt “ agreeable " with two ee’s.

“ Thespis ” brings to us the latest effortof these
very clever people—"lolanthe" Well, this opera
seems to have “ caught on " all right in London, but to
have been a frost in America. One paper says :—“ Their
[Q. and S.’s] recent works have been simple elabora-
uons in funny basinets of their original plan. The pub-
lic shows signs of wearying of this style of thing and
there is every indication that the jig is up." Tne fault
(which is no fault) seems to be that the colouring of the
pieoe ia too local for either transatlantic or antipodean
(this sounds quite Johnsonian!) audiences A few
lines of the song sang by the Queen of the Fairies abont
her sen Stephen (who ia to enter Parliament),will show
at once that, if this ditty ia characteristic of the entire
spirit of the opera, much of its humour will be
“caviare to the general,” and Hebrew to a Rdm reporter.

The beat thing iu the book is the Lord Chancellor’s

“ The Constitutional Guardian

A pleasant occupation tor
A rather susceptible Chancellor.”
This is good enough, of course ; but the critics pretend

composition, immensely clever; but then it may be too
clever to be a success—here, any how. If clever things
always succeeded, how could the Emu live? [Ask ua

There is nothin? more that we can think of to
say about Henry V , except to chronicle the fact that
the unanimity of the supers is wonderful, and that the
lordly conspirators all seem very much relieved when
they are deprived of their swords. Mr. Allison, we
understand, is so enraptured with the success of Henry,
that he has it in contemplation to give some of the other
old dramatists a show. We suggested to him the other
day “ George Barnwell,” but be shook his head aud

Frank Towers had a ben. on Friday last.
Jim Cox played bis namesake in Morton's
farce. It was a performance in which were deli-
cately blended the humour of a Robson, the light-
ness of a Mathews, aud the by-play of a Got James
is evidently cut out for the touch aud go style of the
drama. H e should star for a short season—a very short
season. Seriously, we were glad to see a good house,
and we hope when Ktsa takes her bespeak she will have
all the money in she deserves. . At James’ own bon on
I'liesday, only Towers's adaptation of Jarjeon’s novel
was played, and Jim did not repeat his marvellous im-
personation, to the great grief of the assembled com
pany.

lay lavished upon it. Arthur Roberts plays one of tho
principal parts. And let’s finish by saving that Mr.

In commencing to write this notice we are re-

“ Ah 1” you cry—Mrs Polk I

wanted was to glorify W. J., and give him something

speaking Mr. W. is a kind of modern Hercules : inas-
much as he has contrived to cleanse the Opera House,
which erstwhile used to smell very strongly of nigger,
and be chiefly devoted to benefit matinees at which a
couple of dozen spectators used to fight fleas and guy
the benefigiare until the fall of the curtain. Now, how-
ever, all is changed. The theatre is occupied by star
after star of brightness considerable, the latest being
the matrimonial Polk-planet,

We have heard a lot of the Polks—of them-
selves, of their plays, and of their successes. But that
didn’t impress us. We heard a lot about Dewhuist
before he came here, and were nearly gettingiAlfred.
Monied for saying we were disappointed with him.
1 here is no danger, however (thank Heaven 1) of our
STS “ 88a “ ltod for w hat we are going to say about
tbe Folks, because we were as little disappointed with
them as we can afford to be with anyone. “The
Strategist," their play, is the brightest thing that was
ever written by a New York chemist, and, if the author
can keep up to this standard, none of his productions
should be a drug in the market. The dialogue, in some
parts sparkles like a seidlitz-powder, and there is all
saltz— wa moan sorts—of humour in the situations. As
wo are given to understand that several people peruse
t he Herald and Evening News, we think that to give a
synopsis of the plot would be unnecessary. It would go
against the grain, anyhow. We never like telling a
story. " The Strategist " is described as beingafarcicii
comedy. To suggest the nature of a piece by the title
is often ominous. We have seen “ wild absurdities " in
three acts which have made us weep, and “screaming
farces which have been funnier than a shipwreck, but
not so funny as a funeral. But “The Strategist" is
funnier than both of these. It is, in fact, really droll.
You go there to laugh, and you do laugh. And you go
homo with sore sides wondering how a ohsmWs oou-
oienoe could ever allow him to be so funny.
* • •
But if tho comedy is funny, the interpretation
« flamer. Mr Polk’s Jack Rutledge is au impersona-
tion which will live in our memories even longer than
the gift of a pair of bluchers will exist in the grateful
brain of a Bum dramatic critle. It is full of life and
colour; of quiet humour and artistic by-play ; and his
skill in the protean portions of the piece is really sur-
prising. Of Mrs. Julia A. Polk we have a lot of nice
things to say. Her Nellie Howard is a delicious ripp'e
of merriment. Her laugh is the kind of laugh we
would expect to hear in a fairies’ glen—a pixies’ gretto.
It is a laugh that is catching; and it is so pleasant that
when the usher prods you with his stick at closing
time, you sigh because you cannot take some of it away
with you Mrs. Polk, indeed, reminds us of a rather
largo sunbeam—she is so bright, so gay, so good-
humoured—or at least she would if a sunbeam could
slug—but it can’t. Mrs. Polk can, though. She has
the prettiest voice you ever heard—just enough of it—
and all her songs are sung with a delicate finish that
betokens long and arduous study,
• • •
For the rest, Mr. J. L. Hall made a biff hit aa
Major Abijah Howard, proving incontestably that
comedy is his forte, and that wedlock has not impaired
his powers. Mr George Forbes (whose decision in not
electrifying London, England mourns I) was very nice
as a clergyman. He comes in two or three times, and
is much liked. If he come in ottener, perhaps he
wouldn’t be liked so well! Then there are Mr. and
Mrs Emmett (both good), Harry Leston (surprisingly
funny), and others; all of whom must wait to be
sampled till next wees. This is a handy way of getting
out of writing any more. We have a handy way of
getting out of lots of things like this. At getting ont
of our boarding house when the lambent stars are
gleaming, and letting our shoe-trunk down with a
clothes-line, you can’t lick us.

Miss Juno did very well in Wagga lately. The

critical mmd. He says : “ We would advise Miss Juno
to engage a first-class fiddler, if economy in music be
her object, before paying us a visit again." How that
man would glory in tho classical performance of the
stilts. That reminds us that Miss Juno opens at the
Academy of Music on Saturday. We wish her all sorts
of success, of course, bat we warn her that unless she
gives away a coal mine or a few dead friends nightly, her
chance of making money at this Thespian Temple is
extremely problematical. •• Jennie Deans" will bo the

The Hungerford-Clarke affair is still the sub-
ject of lively discussion up North. Hungerford is a
well-known squatter, a son, we believe, of Mr. Hunger-
ford, lately a member of the N.a. Wales Assembly.
Clarke is a young fellow who went out exploring with
Hungerford, on the understanding that If they die-
covered any good country, ho was to have a share as
compensation for his trouble and risk. Hungerford
returned alone, and when inquiry was made os to Clarke,
staled that he had, by mutual arrangement, left him
behind in the wilderness, os the party had exhausted
their rations, and he (Hungerford) was in a hurry to
get in, having pressing business which required his
attention. He loft Clarke, he said, with ten horses, of
which tour were as good as those he brought away, and
he expected Clarke to follow him, and to arrive in the
settled parts not long after him. It was this expecta-
tion, he explained, which restrained him from reporting
Clarke’s situation. Ho did not regard that as any way
oiitical. In Normanton, however, Hungerford is
alleged to have stated that Clarke was so weak that he
couid not hold a revolver to shoot a horse which the
party had to kill for meat. Still Mr. Hungerford, when
he met Sub-Inspector Urquhart with his troop of
Native Police, among the first individuals he encoun-
tered on his way in, does not appear to have mentioned
Clarke to him at all. And in a long letter of explana-
tion he addressed to the Queenslander, be omitted
any reference to the rather significant circumstance
that he had mot Urquhart. Before the fuss began to be
made about Clarke, Mr. Hungerford told a gentleman
whom he met at Thursday Island, while he was on his
voyage to the South, that Clarke was "all right, and
had stopped there with the cattle." The reply wts, "I
didn’t know you had any cattle with you." To this Mr.
Hangeriord's response was, "Oh, they arc coming on
down oelow. He’ll be there by this time," which ap-
pureutly boars out his statement that he txpeeted
Oiar.se to follow him pretty closely. It is somewhat
singular, nevertheless, that Mr. Hungerford should
have viewed poor Oarka’a situation so aonfldentiy. He
was, it stems, weak, short of provisions, ami in a wiiu
region with only a blaokboy. And the aborigines in the
parr, of the York Peninsula where he was loft are kuowu
to every one who Mas given the subject attention, to be
among thi most hostile and determined in Australia.
They repeatedly fought regular pitched battles with
the Jardines, when those explorers, with a strong and
well-armed party, made their way nortnward to Capo
York through that part of the country. And since
tnat time they have become even more formidable, as
there are now among them a number who have been
pearl-hshing with the whites, and are up to white men’s
ways. These half-civilized blacks are always the most
malicious and formidable. There seems now very little
djubt as to young Clarke’s late. The search party
have found in a blacks’ camp fragments of saddle-
cloths and other spoils, which indicate but too prob-
ably that their late owner is no longer alive to look
after bis property.

PEPPER AND SALT.
Tho editor —Count Conestabila —of tho Jour-
nal ue Rome, organ of the Vatican, ia dead. He had
been coquetting with the Quirinal, and it was felt he
could not be trusted. So he died. Since this, the Pope
has been pensive, and he has now appointed his brother.
Cardinal Peooi, as his "taster." Since his appoint-
ment, Cardinal Peooi has been pensive too, and he
requested Cardinal Howard to act for him in the same
capacity. We understand the reply of his Eminence
was of an unreportablo nature. It was in Italian. Now
that this sort of thing has began, who knows where it
will end ? Soon every eminent man may consider that
his personal safety requires a “taster.” If Alfred
should require one, perhaps ho will let us know. We
were always partial to oowheel.

Tho gentleman who manufactures “ slobber,
weekly, for the London Figaro, says:—"The announce-
ment that Prince Albert Victor of Wales ia about to
enter at Oxford has been received with general interest."
Has it? Now, we ask what possible interest can
attach itself to the eareer of this boy, whoso future,
barring accidents, is a foregone conclusion ? He will
go to Oxford, will then ho pitchforked into the Army,
after having conferred upon him the degree D.C.L. and
a whole lot more by the hoary-headed old crawlers who
belong to the University. Nothing will be heard of
him then until he is made Hon. Colonel of the Canter-
bury Cocktails, and is gazetted Major of his regiment.
He will then, amid universal derision, bo made a
Knight of the Garter, a Colonel, a member of the Fish-
mongers’ Company, and Duke of several things. Then
it will be gravely announced that he is betrothed to
some little female German saujage, who is Princess of
Saxpencolackonberg-Polonitz, and whose father is in
debt to his wood and coal man. About this time. Prince
George will be given charge of the Channel Squadron,
and •• a loyal nation ” will be asked for a million or so
to give the two youngsters a start. What interest at-
taches to all this humbug ? About as much as was
hanging to the spectacle of beholding the Royal kids

Australia has at least one illustrious citizen of
high lineage. This is no other than an illegitimate son
of His Majesty Holy Wilhom, Emperor ol Yarmany.
We hope that the title is sufficiently disguised so no
libel can attach. This is not libel, though solid truth.
These giddy Emperors! No sooner does a military
favourite own a handsome, impressionable wife, than
the Holy Wilhelms want to become partners—to share
her. The Crown Princess’s brother-in-law is, we are
glad to report, a respectable married ratepayer. He
says he leaves the illegitimate business to the old man,
who can very well afford it.

The following is a copy of the reply sent by
Sir Henry Parkea to tho letter received by him from

" Sydney, Feb. 16, 1883.
•' Sir Henry Parke?, to Widow Sohmalfuss, Germany.
“ Mnch-suffering Madam,—Your letter of thanks of
7th December, 1882, I have received (got), and seen
from it how you display (show) much gratitude for the
500 quid (pounds) whiohwere despatched (forwarded) to
you last year. Personally (myself), I feel gladness at
the circumstance that the small amount made happi-
ness (joy) for your family, and saved your house and
home (oourt-yard). I also so much admire the duality
(trait) which you possess in common with the natives
(aboriginals) of this land—amongst whom your illus-
trious brother mingled—of speaking your mind (in-
clination) about money matters. As to your request
(demand) for more, I feel great regret (sorrow) that I
have no longer in my possession (grip) the keys of the
money-box here, or you might otherwise have been
further richly rewarded (presented) for those acts (dis-
coveries) which your honoured brother might have
made if tho blacks (cannibals) had not dropped across
him. Hoping yovi are well (hearty), I take leave (sign
myself) with all tho honours,

Judge Docker considers that book-making is
not "an illegal means of making a livelihood," and the
conviction against Hugh Thomson, Esquire, was
quashed. We congratulate Mr. Thomson, and trust
that the police duly apologised when returning to him
his pea and-thimble and his match-box. The question
arises now as to wha t is illegal. It has been already
proved by tho decision in Cocks’s case, that praying is ;
but a jury, on the other hand, under the influence, per.
haps, of Mr. Levicn’s eloquence, found that at " head,
ing them ” it was “ lawful to ring in the tail gray on
the man who had the kip.” A pin oushion-and-slipper
lottery at a fancy fair contravenes the Statutes very
much, and a man who heaves a pebble at a snarling dog
may drop in for it. No person can lie on the grass iu
Hyde Park without fear of being " lumbered," and
selling pea-nuts on a Sunday entails fine or imprison
ment. But you can start a "diddle-um” sweep and
no one will interfere with you, and you can booktnake
for ready-money and vamoose with the pool, and the law
can’t reach you. The moral is, therefore, bookmake.
Praying is a good game, and we once thought of taking
to it, if we could find a fashionable parson to sell out at
a fair figure. Bub we shan’t now. We want to keep
within the pale of the law. So when we’re tired of
writing, we shall bookmake.
I A poor, half-starved looking man applied to a
Forbes storekeeper for a job three weeks ago. He found
work as a gardener. Last week a black-edged letter
came to him. His father, a wealthy man, had jast died
in Ireland, leaving property to the value of £200,000.
The gardener’s share was £30,000. There's a bigger
sum on hand for a brother—also a swagsman—who is
somewhere else in Australia.
Thakombau, “King” of Fiji, is dead. Of
course ho had a happy death, and a square par. in the
Echo. People who die under the auspices of the
missionaries always do. Thakombau died “ full of
hope,” also full of rum and the clergy. Not one of the
scores of people he had helped to eat turned up at his
bedside. The old boy’s demise is attributed to a
farbunole. Thakombau was here once—a fact embedded
Sin. deep in the memory of 80,000 people. With his
sons Eatn Joteph and Eatn Timothy he was a guest of
Sir Hercules Eobinson at Government House, while we
were all up to our necks in the little game of diddling
him out of his empire. It’s always been a mystery why
Herky wasn’t raised to the peerage in consideration of
his sufferings. Lady Eobinson didn’t take to the Koyal
guests at all, and often gave him a bit of her mind for

girls." All the timethey wore at Government House they
didn’t use a bit of soap, and their excuse was that they
learnt it from the oil-gatherers—-that is the mission,

the king’s honour on Moore Park, and word went
round that the old man didn’t intend wearing much—
that, in fact, he meant to go in the regalia of a can.

When the Governor and suite (a numerous one, by the
way) arrived, all the country, and, of course, his wife,
were on the ground. Boon came the King—the crowd
howling after him He entered the vice-regal
tent by the front, and a thousand heads were
immediately poked in behind. Two thousand volun-

the crowd forced their way between the ranks.

foruiust a king, and it was quite clear they were all

A howling, screaming, good-tempered mob of

WHAT HE CAME FOR.

A venerable man, now mind.
And patriarchal quite.
And through the mullioned windows there
Did float a golden tide.
The parson here did oft repair.
When it waJ hot outside.
He rested in a cushioned pew,
Woke from a slumber mild.
When, tip-toe, up the aisle he knew
There crept a lovely child.
His eyes were of a lustrous blue.
Of auburn-gold his hair ;
His tint it was angelic, too—
The child was passing fair !
“ My gentle boy,” the parson cried,
“ ’Tis well you seek to-day
In this quiet, holy house to hide.
And shun all wicked play;

Have begrimed the robes of a bounteous Sod
Through a martyrdom of ages.

* nhovo is the title of soma 100 pages of poetical
T<V?. c that has recently floated out of the printing estab-
Lonf of F Cunuinghame and Co. It possesses, to
b8h fvf a words of an old writer, all the melancholy m«d-
without any of the inspiration of poetry. Mr.

t0 hav0 to place Mr Allen by the side of his

of inaccuracies in description and detail; sense

Mr Allen has adopted the versification of his “In

general spirit, tone, and language of the Laureate in
following ore a few of Mr. Allen's inappropriate
deletions, and unintelligible expressionsIn the
« n me niece, entitled “ The Illusion,” he speaks of
« Swallows skipping o’er the waves,” and of “ Emeralds,

affecting efforts, is one on “The death of an old New.

Poor Captain’s dead, ho bowed his head.
His troubles are over now.
No plumes we spread, no praj/ors were read
When he gave his last bow-wow ;
Though up in years he shed no tears
When told his end was nearing.
Ending with—
“ So all is o’er, and he’s no more,
With bones and scraps delighting,
The sea will roar j ust as before
And fleas will go on biting."
And reminding one strongly of Byron’s lines—
•• See how the subject suits his noble mind,

Cofflus, shrouds, biers, palls, corpses, hearses, urns,
tombs, skeletons, and all the paraphernalia of the
undertaker, dance in rhythmic confusion on almost
every page. Life is compared to a “ tent," a road, a
river a year, a day, an hour, a minute, a desert, an
oasis’ &o The sell is always “ generous," old men’s
locks’ always “white and flowing,” trees invariably
“ knarled and knotted,” the clouds (like waistcoats)
always “lined," and the stars, the moon, the ocean,
rooks, oofflas, mountains, forests, rivers, plains, &o.,
are in a perpetual and monotonous state of "Bleep;
while to complete the somnambulistic effect, all the
maidens are “dreaming.” This melancholy picture is
further brightened by the “ weeping willow and the

Mr Allen is at his best in these scenes of shadows,
shrouds, and sadness; and when he indulges in a
lighter strain, he is very apt to run off the rails and
like the Liverpool-street tram. Ho has a very
baid effusion on the “more-pork” bird; another on a
R C Chaplain; and some semi-jocular lines on a ehaiRed
eagle, in which he unconsciously performs a poetic
vagary of a startling kind, by making the sagacious
bird revolve in its own mind the present, past, and
future of the human race. In another place he speaks
of “ the heart,” “the pangs,” “the breast, the
destiny," “the longings," and “ the remorse of a
river 1 I All in one verse. Following this is a pathetic
fragment, entitled “ The Grave by the Shore,” in which
short piece there are three separate references to
“ willows" Each time the unfortunate trees are
“ weeping " The moonlight is mentioned twice, and
each time it is "sleeping;" the ocean is referred to
twice—once as the “ murmuring deep, and onoe, for
variety, as the “ murmuring sea. After climbing over
a few more verses, wa oomo to some “Impromptu
Linos,” beginning—
“ A roofless church, where curlews keep
A midnight watch while coffins sleep
Now of course everyone knows that the word " Bleep”
is a grand weapon in a poet s hand. It will rhyme with
heaps of words, but still Mr. Allen
little sparing, and if he is wise he will withdraw his
book and knock out a few superfluous sleeps,
“ weeps,” and “ dreams ” Of course we don t mean all
of them, or too many—say about 400' of each; and it
would make thing* less gloomy, too, if he were to dis-

Only one more extract: that in explanation of the fate
of the large number of copies of the Shroud which are
never sold. Thus lightly tings the bard :—
“ I have sat by the bed of the sick, when clouds
O’er the valley so dismally hung,
I’ve aided to wrap the poor clay in the shrouds
When the die has been oast and shadows have passed.
And the last mortal link has been wrung.
Of course we know what Shroud he refers to, bat what

publish his poems. There is very little in i hem 1 hat

true, however, that no intelligent fad of 18 would have
written anything in the volume. It is but just to esy
that Mr. Allen’s rhyme, as a rule, is very good , but tb 0

judice those who can appreciate good pootry agaiust

that Mr. Allen’s work has boon absolutely eulogised

An experiment was reported to be made at the
Morgue, of freezing the dead bodies, and in ono case il
was so successful that on the doctor hitting one corpse
on the breast with a stick, it sounded just as if he had
struck a stone. While they were there, who should
enter but a man on the look-out for recruits for the
Shroud. Suddenly, he started back. He recognised
another body, the corpse of an old reporter. He was
frozen hard, too, but on tho doctor tapping him play,
fully on the head with a stick, it sounded as though he
had struck a gong I Having transacted a little commer-
cial business with the other corpses, the recruiter then
genteelly withdrew.
Apropos of the bungle made by Mar wood in
•despatching one of the Mau ntrasua murderers, Truth
■observes that hanging is a delicate matter to say any-
thing about, because many estimable people don’t like
it. Juries are rather against it. Prisoners, too, some-
•times raise ridiculous objections. Judges, however,
generally like it. They seem to enjoy the importaaoe
it gives them; then, a real good cry when passing sen-
tence with the black cap on is a luxury which many a
good old womanish judge is by no means insensible to ;
oesides, their wives like to hoar all about it when they
go home to dinner.
The Special Commissioner of the Narandera
Argus recently visited the Wangarefda mission of the
godly (dribble. His opinion is that there does—hear
him I—not “ appear any immediate probability of the
race dying out. judging by the proportion of babies
about the place, while so far as future prospects are
•concerned thorn ate certainly two sable ladies at the
.station, who, if they love their lords, should certainly
•bo >n the seventh heaven of exultation." However,
this reminds us of an anecdote iu connection with this
place. The blacks (jolly few Hacks I) decorate their huts
with pictures from the Graphic and other illustrated
papers. Well, when Poebery ana tho "Commish’* went
there some time ago, he entered the house of a big
nigger and hi» piebald “ missus," and he said, pointing
to a picture of the Prince of Wales—“ Who’s that?"
“That fellow belong David," was the reply. “Thou
who’s this?" enquired Mr. F. tapping a portrait of
<letowayo. The biackfellow considered a minute, then
lie said—“That fellow—um—oh, him Ponshns Pi."
Things are lively in Wilcannia. Widows go
about there with a wedding ring and keeper in their
pockets, and after getting the festive bnshman tight,
send for the parson and get him to marry them. A
widow, it seoms, recently invited a man named Johnson
and another named Curtis (“just down”) to an hotel,
and the men got “boosed” and the widow “lively,"
This led to Johnson being found taking finger-rings
from another woman who was in bed “ with tics;’’ and
finally to the happy pair—for Curtis married her 1—pass-
ing their wedding night in the lock-up. They wore given
in charge for not paying 17s. 6d. for bottled beer. Tho
evidence reads like a burlesque police report in a comic
paper. It aoems that at the widow’s entertainment,
there was, in accordance with the elevated usages of
Wiloannia, “ grog galore, and the spirits of the quar-
’otto ran high ; and while Johnson and ‘the young man
from the country ’ got rather groggy, the widow became
frisky, and played ooquettuhly with a new wedding
>iDop and keeper." Thus the Wilcannia Walterus.
When, a little later, Johnson had sallied forth after
flager-rings, the widow and tho young man—the paper
again—“did a little spooning on the occasion in a pri.
vale room. They then left, and went to another hotel
at the other end of the town, and came back again in
the afternoon. The parson then arrived at the hotel,
a id joined the pair in ‘holy wedlock ’" The parson,
it seems, only went in for “ a bottle of ginger-beer, but
the others had whisky and champagne. When the row
about the beer occurred, later, the bride averred that
she was not drunk, though she was not sober; but she
had plenty.” We always thought Wilcannia was a nice
place to live at. Now we are quite sure of it.
Two boys, James and Abraham Hall, 13 and 16

Alcohol quickened the circulation, but such quickening
of t.he circulation was always followed by (repression,

AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.
CANTO II (Continued).
XXI.
But passing by each roadside den unholy,
I went my way engaged in silent prayer,
'“'in for many days my soul craved solely
For gin—my usual liquor had been 11 square ” —
That wish I grappled with, and coming •• slowly
Bright from tho old dark life" (as you're aware
I quote the laureate), I got appointed
As clerk to one of Wesley's most anointed.
XXII.
I meekly sought ray desk at six on Monday,
And meekly worked until again ’twas six ;
X heard tho Gospel preached on every Sunday,
And saw the errors of tho Catholics.
And when our people had a tea and bun day
I lugged the water and brought up the sticks.
And hawked the teapot round, an 1 grinned benignly,
And thought I really was progressing finely.
XXIII.
And so I was till, being too ambitious,
I felt like Wolsey. Thus it came to pass,
Acceding to my worthy master’s wishes,
I went as teacher to an evening class.
Tho usual history—tho heart is vicious.
And Satan, masked as a converted lass,—
O’erthrow me, and In anger lees than sorrow
I left—with all the bullion I could borrow,
XXIV.
And roamed all o’er Victoria, till arriving
Far in tho wet wild West where murphies grow
*• a "job o’ wurrk,” —at first 'twas driving
Miok Hogan's teams—Miok Hogan, you must know.
Was the one scion in the world surviving
Of the old Irish kings of Ballycxow.
He bore the thickest skull that e’er fell whacks on.
And loved his countrymen, and scorned the Saxon.
XXV.
Here, after very brief deliberation,
I slung my creed and wont across to Borne,
And planked the money and got Confirmation ;
And while I rooted spuds from out the loam
I quoted from the Advocatr and Nation
The wrongs the tenantry endured a. home;
And that tho British might, in Michael Davitt,
Just find they’d hardly got a irau to laugh at.
XXVI.
This fetched the Greeks, and when my master saw i
that I
For several Fridays I lot np on beef
And went to Mass to harken Latin jaw that
Was like Cork jargon from a Chocktaw chief,
He said 1o me : He ishn't worrth a sthraw, that
Jack Smith; nexht wake I'll rack tho English
thief.
An’ ye can take his job—why tare an’ ages.
These two days past he hasn’t amt his wages."
XXVII.
So through the Church I was made second boss of
His farm and station, and as time weut past,
I grow more reconciled to bear tho less of
My chops, and never missed a single fast.
And every night, before I sought my ‘‘doss’’ of
“ Clane sthraw,” I prayed that these good times might
last,
And in the morning, era I donned my pants,
1 Prayed for the poor benighted Protestants
XXVIII.
And always swore their Ged was but a Dagon,
And all their pastors runners for Ouid Nick ;
And vowed I’d rather be a black-skinned Fagan,
Than anything except a Catholic
And waited band and foot on Father Egan,
With whom I name to be extremely “ thick,”
By often saying that in truth 1 saw naught
bo good from England as tho ‘‘bhoye" from Con-
naught.
XXIX.
And thus I grew in grace and worldly riches,
And this I say to every mother’s son.
Whoso empty palm tor earthly profit itches.
Go thou and do the same as I have doni.:
Attend the Mass, and wear the blackest breaches*
If you’re a Papist; but if j oti are none
Of these (the thing will suit you all to pieces
Try tho Salvation Corps—‘‘All night with Jewira."

Wall, down the gap my aged swagman wended
His wav, with joy on his pert,piling face;
He knew hie pilgrimage was well-nigh ended.
He also knew that in this detort place
He could obtain a fierce nepenthe splendid
To dulltu* brain, and for a time erase
All though) cl bygone pain and future trial.
Which loaf a life of wearisome denial.
XXXI.
The fire was blazing high as he drew close to
Tho camping ground, and he could plainly mark
A man, who lifted up and held his nose to
A junk of mutton, old as Noah’s Ark-
Far viler stuff than many a steward throws to
The humble stomach of the waiting shark ;
And heard him curse, as it was from him hurled,
“ Himself, and his own soul, and ai). the world."
XXXII.
And coming nearer he heard conversation
To this effect, most forcibly addressed
By him, who at the fireside held his station.
To someone else: “ Look ‘ere, my boys; fro
blest”
(He said, “ I’m d—d," but on consideration
I always have concluded that it’s best
To leave bad language out, because I hate it,
And know the printer would eliminate it.)
xxxm.
I think you’ll all admit that nothing smoother
Or cleanlier than my muse has e’er been known.
Not even the mystie sou of “ mystic Uther "
Spoke nobler sentiment from his fair throne.
Nor Godlier language fell from Martin Luther,
Nor manlier ut terance from M’KUhone—
Let Mao-elhone for utterance—but damme I
My Kerristian readers, where tho davit am I ?
xxxiv.
Another rum, dear—light. There’s nothing surer 1
Than that, so far cs I have told this tale
’Tis true, and as a consequence is purer
Than splendid fictions like tho Holy Grail.”
I am as truthful as an average j uror.
And in no solitary instance fail
To moralise—I ought to hold the laurel
For moralising, as for being moral.
xxxv.
But, there a difference between these two things.
Don’t make no error—I’ll just point it out.
A man may moralise and yet may do things
Not wholly moral ; he may spout and spout
Ot Grace, and be quite decent in a few things.
He may not gamble, drink, or largely shout.
He may appear all Christian love and meekness.
And yet possess a devil of a weakness.
xxxvi.
His holy ardour may bo as a coal, hot.
His life a blameless one to human sight;
He may engage with sin, with heart and soul hot.
And wield a mighty falchion in the fight;
But then the thing comes in that spoils the w hole
lot.
And makes the totting up come hardly right—
No ardour that he knows (’tis sad, but true) lick*
His ardour for securing tho "spoudalix."
XXXVII.
Fall many a prelate, magister, and primate
Use Jesns’ name, the sinners’ pnr c e to touch,
Fall few show any terror of the climate
They threaten us poor devils with so much ;
How many priests the dollar or the dime hate,
Compared to those whose policy is Dutch?
How many Teachers grouped the Golden Calf at
Our blind credulity must inly laugh at ?
xxxvill.

Here is some truth : A man of clay may play up
And drink and swear a bit j :isb now and then.
And yet, be largely virtnom, and pay up
Full twenty shillings to his fellmw-men.
And when the day arrives perhaps may weigh np.
And pan off splendidly (as Chunder Sen
Would put it. Very often do I wonder
How many Bishops will outbalance Chunder.

Fit for a nigger, let alone a man.

Eighty navvies have arrived at Townsville, as
immigrants, under special agreement for 12 months,with
Messrs. Overond and Co. Their wages, a local paper
understands, are “ £10 a year and rations.’’
Mrs. Toohey, who was defeated in her action
against Government for £5000 damages for the killing
of her husbnnd by a tram, has obtained a rule nisi tor a
new trial, Mr. Darley, Q.C., contending that Govern-
ment has at present no legal power to run steam motors
alohg a public street. Which reminds us that Mr.
Scott, locomotive engineer, goes to America and Europe
to investigate the tramway question for the railway
department.
Dr. .T. M. Creed (formerly surgeon to the S. A.
Government’s North Australian Exploring Expedition),
writes in the current number of the Australasian
Medical Gazette, of which he is now editor, a short
paper on •• Extraordinary customs of the Aborigines of
Northern Australia’’—whose tendencies, it would ap-
pear, are of a peculiarly Malthusian description. A
paper on the same subject was recently read before the
Linnean Society by Dr. J. C Cox.
Smith and Robinson, two eminent larrikins,
convicted at Tass with a loss distinguished comrade of
the crime of garotting amen named Buckley last Novem-
ber. are to be digged. Mr. Smith, who will, no doubt,
“tnuoal some,” gets five years, with thirty lashes a
week hence. The judge has also been kind enough to
get up behind his promissory note for thirty more
lashes in a month. Mr. Bolinson, C.M.G , gets three
years labour, twenty lashes in a week, and twenty more
in a month.
The late R. H. Pempill, official assignee, em-

Two Sydney detectives were called into an hotel
a couple of days ago to investigate an alleged robbery of
jewellery. The man thev interviewed bore strong re-
semblance to a photo, that had long been in their
pocket-books, and the photo, was that of one Samuel
M’Connell, suspected with another man named Mills of
the £2000 gold robbery at the Day Dawn claim.

certain hy a confession from M'Conneil. He is now on
his road to Brisbane for his reward.
Last Sunday a monster shark "chawed up” a dog
at the very spot, in Iron Cove Bay, Sydney Harbour,
where the man Bacon was found disembowelled some
weeks ago The dog was swimming. Then he suddenly
disappeared. When he came up he didn’t bark—his
head was off. Another moment a 13fb. shark rushed at
him, and kft only his tail. On Monday, at Seven
Shilling Beach—we know how it got that name—also in
Sydney harbour, a monster shark was discovered
stealthily moving towards a little hoy who was bathing.
The father of the lad attacked the finny monster (that’s
the way the Lyre has it) with a paddle, and it dis-
appeared.
It is twenty-five years since we had such a
glorious season in N.S. W. as the present. r ihe rainfall
in January is greater than that of any month for forty-
two years. From November to the middle of February
rain has fallen almost every week, thunderstorms,
which for some years had qnite disappeared, being of
frequent, occurrence. This great rainfall which has
enriched the country almost beyond estimate, has very
strangely not been accompanied by floods in any dis-
trict in the colony. Oh ! and as this par. has been
written for our Berlin and Lapland readers, wo may as
well state, ns another glorious fact—there has been a
change of Ministry.
Writes a correspondent:—"The delayed tele-
gram business is a hash. Here is, an illustration.
Imagine a’delayed’ teleg>am being handed in at five
minutes to closing hour. The sender will certainly
benefit by marking his message ‘delayed,’ Will the
Department supply extra hands to carry on ihe ‘de-
layed ’ business, or will they allow the poor devils of
country operators, who do duty 111 hours per day, extra
pay ? I know one station where the junior operator,
who has been over four years in the service, and gets
£26 per annum, has been repeatedly denied promotion
although he has managed the office for months at a
time. Will the Department, for example, allow him 50
per cent on his present wretched pittance P*‘
Thomas Smith, a dark, thin, weak-looking man
was tried at Darlinghurst Assises on Monday, for kill,
ing Philip Eoels, master of the British vessel A nnie C
Lynn, on the high seas, in Dace in ber last. Prisoner
was steward of the vessel, and one evening, while drunk,
was ordered to put away the tea-things Ha neglected
to do so, whereupon the captain knocked him down,
kicked him and put him in irons. Two hours after-
wards, while the captain was diiectingthe mate to make
an entry of the circumstance in the log-book, prisoner
shot him through the heart with a revolver. When
arrested, ho expressed no regret. The jury found the
prisoner guilty of murder, but recommended him to
maroy. The Judge sentenced him to be ha< ged.
Leichhardt’s, sister Mrs. Henrietta Schmalfnss,
to whom the Government some time ago sent £500,
writes to Sr Henry Paries asking for further assist-
ance, and stating teat the amount remitted to her a
year ago only ju»t sufRjed to save from salo the real
estate possessed by hor family. She adds that as she
understood the sum already paid was sent to relievo
her more pressing necessities, and that she was to re-
ceive more, she had pledged herself to make further
payments to creditors early in the present year. “ With
onr daily hard work, and high interest [rent], wa can
have nothing over; therefore, forgive mo, an old
woman, much worn irom grief and care, when I bog for
your kind mediation with regard to a second assistance.”
The case is one with which the present Parliament will
be disposed to deal very liberally.
Dr. Maurice J. O’Connor, writing in the
Australasian Medical Gazette, says that during the
past four years, he has treated 1615 oases of delirium
tremens, 21 only of whom died. He attributes his
unprecedented success to the fact that he has in all
eases aimed at procuring sleep in a very short period,
by what may he termed very large doses of drugs. He
is perfectly satisfied, after five years’ experience of the
disease, as presented in gaol practice, that it is nowise
to administer in delirium tremens small or
moderate doses of hypnotics. He has
opium, digitalis and oonium in favour of bromidn
potassium and chloral hydrate. Ladies and cent

on the bold assertion that Pailiament is what thn
people make it. This is a new and original observation •
we never heard it before. Mr. Dvmock, president c

panimeut, and a hundred guinea coffee service fer Mrs"
Dymock. Something happened at the Show, jaias
Geoghegan, on Hollybrook, won the second prise for
ladies hackneys, shown by a red ribbon. As this
ribbon tied to the horse’s head made him fidgety, in the
next competition for best lady rider, she removed it
For this, she was told to leave the ring, or in exact
words, to ‘’clear out,” for what was termed “want of
respect to the judges,” who refused to accept any ex-
planation. It seemed to outsiders very unreasonable
treatment. Miss Geoghegan, however, had obtained fir*t
prize at the last Kiama show for best lady rider as
also at Wollongong show the week before, so perhaps
there may not have been such a want of reason after ali.
James Casey, town councillor of Dublin, has
turned informer, and deposes that all the men anested
for the murder of Lord Cavendish and Mr. Burke
except one, were prominent asiassina. Mr. Forster’
Earl Oowper. and others, were •• sentenced to death”
by the secret tribunal, and repeated unsuccessful at.
tempts were made on their lives. An unknown person
“Number One,” directed the assassins* movements’
and supplind funds subscribed either in America or by
the Laud League He (Carey) himselt suggested the
idea of effecting the Phoenix Park assassinations by
means of knives. Seven < f the pri oners waylaid the
victims. Kelly, Brady, Delaney, and M'Caffsry were
the actual murderers Carey admitted mat he himself
signalled the approach of Cavendish and Burke
Brady finished the former, and Kelly stabbed the latter"
Brady cutting the throats of both. The weapons
were afterwards destroyed. Mr Bnrke was first at.
tanked by Brady, who stabbed him. Cavendish then
interfered in Burke’s behalf, and Bradv turned upon
him, hacking him to death. Then he finished Burke
When both victims were evidently dead, ho wiped hia
knife on the grass. The other assassins carried rovol.
vers. Cards ware immediately sent to three Dahlia
papers stating that Cavendish and Burke had been
executed by direction of the “Irish Invincible.” Carey
clearly implicated his brother as having been concerned
ia some of the murders ; and also said tho League had
sent the prisoners money since they were im prisoned
There was tremendous excitement in court. As Carey’s
fearful story was told the prisoners appeared to be
terror-stricken ; but at tim es they biseed the informer,
whose evidence absolutely confirms their guilt.

Thus the Cumberland Times on Mr. Wisdo
as a politician:—[ Imprimis , a frightful diatri
which we won’t reprint] We can dearly set
through Mr. Wisdom’s little game. Ho aspir

become so subdued to what they work in—the narro
littlenesses of legal pettifogging—that it would bu

Miss Parnell says that the Land League has—
to put it vulgarly—snavelled all the funds she coll-iotec
and she has been very ill in consequence. She says sh<
won’t collect any more, so wo suppose Miss Anna wi
now find leisure to invoke the muse. We may exp to ;
therefore to see, at no distant date, something iu th s
style:—

For the credit of the Parliament it is to b
hoped that the Assembly does not contain many mem
bers who entertain the same view of thair responsible
tioa as that whioh is held by Mr. Bills, of Newcastle
He is anxions that the salaries of some shipping officer
at Newcastle should be increased, and has threatenec
that if the Government do not aeoode to his wishes h
will seriously consider whether he will not obstruct th
progress of the estimates by challenging every proposec
increase. Such a threat comes with very bad grao
from a member who is said to be one of the larges :
shipowners in the colony. It is certainly calculated to
give rise to suspicions whioh may be exceedingly un
just to himself and to the officers concerned.
Carey, the L nblin Town Councillor, who tnrnec
informer, when his own guilt was made clear by th
carman, Cavanagh, states that the movoa ent of ai

who was known to them only as “Number One." This
gentleman is said to be General Milne, formerly an
officer in tho Federal army, Casey, whose confession
have shocked the world, says the assassination of Mr
Burke, the Under Secretary for Ireland, was decider
on alter the appearance of an article in the Dublin
Freeman's Journal. The English Press is unanimous
in calling on Mr. Parnell for an explanation of the
alleged identity of the Land League with the aasassi.
nations.
Here is a fair specimen of Mr. Taylor’s oratory
taken from his speech in the House against the teach
ing ®f history in State schools Pliant, pliable, anc
plastic youth cannot drink deep at the fountains o:
history without being imbued with the black bile o
bigotry, indoctrinated with the bane of intolerance, anc
inoculated with the upas b ight of unoharitableness
When the ill weeds of intolerance choke their liberalism
will you be content to see Australia’s sons oleri coerced
looking askance at each other because they worship Got
under different formulas, and kneel not at the same
altar? Do jou want good-minded liberal men and!
women, or would you rather have a brood of religions
reptiks, eoolesiastical eels, sacerdotal scorpions
and polemical pisants ? Is the country to be peopled
by Btraight-g.-ing liberal men, or by underground
s.tvages of the Jim-Crow-John-Daviesty^o?’’
Mr. Bruce Smith has distinguished himself by a
cnnple of slashing speeches. His maiden effort in the
House was a bold one; he assumed the role of censor,
and selected Mr. Wisdom as a fitting subject for criti-
cism. He said that during the time that, he had been
in the House, he had carefully watched the actions of
the ex-Attorney-General to find out if there was any
justification for the reputation whioh he had as a poli-
tician. T he result was that he had come to the eon-
elusion that, as a public man, Mr. Wisdom was incon-
sistent, ungrateful, and discourteous. Ho went on to
say: “ If I thought that the result of fifteen years’
experience on my part in politics would bo similar to
that shown in the case of the hon. member, I should
resign mv scat to-morrow." Oa Friday evening last he
brought bis legal knowledge to bear on a bill relating
to trespass, introduced by Mr. Hoydon, and absolutely
pulled it to places, with the result that the House re-
jected it on tho second leading. This is the second
time during the session that a check his been put on
Mr. Hej don’s overweening conceit. If he wishes to
become an object of ridicule like itavid Buchanan, he
has only to persevere in the stylo whioh has character-
ised his actions since he has been a member.
Here is a neat little political scandal. An
Inland postal official was iu trouble with his oasu. S ime
of his friends subscribed sufficient to make everjthing
square, the money to bo returned. One flue morning
he suddenly started for Sydney, and did not show back.
Defalcations to tne extent of £600 were then disc, yerod,
and of this amount there was a sum of £2fj0 paid'in by
a local resident, who threatened proceedings against
the Government. That money was quickly return led to
him. The most extraordinary part of the affair is
that an inspector from the department was present at
the post o£JJce when the defalcations became known in
the first instance, and accepted tho loan to make good
tbe fraud. A similar act was performed by another
inspect or in a somewhat similar ease. The defalcations
of another postal official who had gone crooked mere
supposed u, be under £700. The amount subscribed
was accepted by the inspector to square the defoioa.

much greater that other steps were taken All this
occurred in the reign of the Parkes Government—“ tin

ne uly they cloaked wrll-sonneoied thieve*. Now who
are these men whose irauds are m„n.ioued hereP Wno
are the postal inspectors, and under and by whose
authority have they compounded a felony ?
, The extraordinary circumstance that at Tel-el-
Keoir, our aimy approached within a few hundred yards
o; Arabi s position without euoounteriug a tingle out-
post, and was so enabled to take the by sur-
prise, and carry their entrenchments by a coup dc main,
in explained by London Vanitt Fair, by a o.aiemenc
‘ft.m a most authoritative sourcv. in a gypt ’* *ltis
this: that Saltan Pasha, who, as is known, occupied a
high position in the Egyptian Army, was all through in
o laiuiunlcation with air Garnet Wolseley; that he
leooivtd the sum of £10,000 from the Khedive, and that
in considers, ion of this he, on the nigut before the ac-
tion of i el tl-KeoIr, and after Aram had retiitd to
r0t t, gave ciders that the whole of the outlying pickets
of tne Egyptian Army s ho aid be called in; tuat they
were accordingly called in, and that thus everything
was made easy for the surprise which was effected a
few hours after by the English troops " Evorytuiug is
fair in war : every sort of villainy. But if Tel-el-Kebir
was leally told for £10,000, a decent modesty about the
exploits of our bravo fellows might have been observed.
Loid Wo siley was entitled to his patent of nobility, cf
couioe. ‘I., is quite in regie that successful trickery in
war should win a coronet. This 1 el-el-he bit arrange-
ment teems to have had a close relationship with the
astounding generalship of B. B. Smith, when he saved
t he pi occasion at the laying of the pedestal for tie
Q men's statue from confusion by masterly manoeuvres

The honourable John Lucas, M.L.C., having,
consequent on a trip iu New Zealand, recovered ins
health, which had become seriously impaired by his
in rouleau labours wlulst Minister lor Mines Uve years
Ago—bis principal efforts in ttie way of wisa administra-
tion being to find bnieis (or all his sons—and by recent
mental struggles to u-itermine the exact value of a
useless stone quarry at Pyrmont, made his reappear-
ance in the Legislative Council chamber last week,
and received a most cordial welcome from—the backs
of all his old anotiatof. As he waddled into the room
he wore a sort of “hew do you do old fellow’* exptetsion
on bis half uoie of couu euauoe, but as he approached
member after member, and each one of them foand It
convenient not to have his thoughts disturbed by such
a passing trifle, he manifested a dej otedair. Bat great

not avoivi recoguitiug him, however much he m»y have
c’eslred to do so. This was the Piesident. Of comae

coming uigmly. It was noticed (hat he dropped the

which look place was not ef a very animated nature.

Things were lively in the Assembly on Friday
night. Mr. Buobauau mule a speech in favour of ih-t
pugnacious person, Zimmlor, the Gnlgoug chemist,
who was struck eff the commission ot the peace for
drunkenness, and showed that though Mr, A G
Taylor, bis colleague iu the reprcseniali m of Mudgeo,
who had spoken strongly against Zimmier’s claims, he
(the Gitaffh') hud written a private letter promising that
individual (who h id now tor the sixth time been elected
Mayor of Galgoug) his support. The Giraffe happened
to bo out of the House when David spoke, but return-
ing, and being informed ot what the great apostle of
Oaiiyle hud stated, he proceeded to get straight on to
that orator. It was quite true that he had promised to
support Z.mmler, but ho had done so before perusing
the papers, which threw quite another light on the
ca*o. J P. Zimmlor, he remarked, had not only been
drunk, out had borved a term for poisoning a child. It
might have boon all accidental, bat as Zimmler had
been in gaol fur a criminal offence, he wasn’t lit to be
put on the judgment-seat. Next, as to David himself.
Nature, when the hou gentleman was maloouoeived,
had given him blabber for brains, polysyllables tor elo-
quence, and with the lungs of a town bellman had
made him run away with the idea that be was a poli-
tical Demosthenes. (Laughter) He wax a man who
would hoist any fiig, defile any religion, or discard any
creed or clergy, or use any vituperation, so long as he
served his own ends, and for a time basked in the sun
of notoriety. (Laughter 1 Ha appeared once as a tern,
peranoe lecturer, begging men to be temperate, and with
the proceeds from that lecture he bad chartered a
springoart and had filled it with brsndy and champagne.
He was next found In the wilds ot Queensland, in the
gaib of Adam, with a brandy bottle iu one hand and a
bottle of champagne in the other, drinking the health
of the whole aboriginal population with three
times three for ... . the Quean of Bunguree.
(Laughter, and “ Oh, oh.’*) Then Mr. Speaker stood
up, and the Giraffe sat down. Besoming, ho said he
would put it all hypothetically : There might have
been such a person as he had described (Laugh or.)
Speaking, then, hypothetically, there w..s an
hon. gentleman who had met him (Mr. Taylor} near
the time of the opening of Parliament, and said to him,
* Now, to be effective in our action we must be united ;
you must vote for Barton as Speaker, beoause that
tyrant Allen is not fit food for worms.” A lev days
afterwards he met the same hon. gentleman, who said :
“ You made a very great mistake, bub it is quite pos-
sible to retrieve it, provided you pay particular atten-
tion to the vote for the Chairman ot Committees. They
are going to put up Mr. Triokett against Mr. Cameron.
Vote tor him; but for God’s sake don’t vote for that
Cameron, because he (a a tyrant iynd sits on aU young
members." Un the eve of the election of tho Chairman
of Committees—the hon. member was on the opposition
side of the House then —he said to him (Mr. Taylor),
forgetting all he had previously told him, •• The idea to
bring that oad of a milksop Triokett up; I, for my part,
shall vote for Mr. Cameron. I think he is a real sensible
fellow, and a thoroughgoing, impartial man; and be-
cause I have jnst discovered my cousin was the midwife
that brought him into existence.’’ (” Oh, oh," and
screams ot laughter ) He wound up by remarking that
perhaps the language be had used had been too rough
to apply to an honourable gentleman ; but let it be re-
marked that it had been applied to a man who had a
pachydermatous hide. Whereupon Mr. speaker arose
once more, and the Giraffe wound up his oration. Ba-
e turn an in reply talked about hallowed feeling:, of honour
and treachery and so on, and with respect to the story
about the wilds of Queensland and the bruidy-bottle,
iko., said that the Giraffe was another, and the House
knew it. Which concluded a most enjoyable little rally
between tho representatives ot heavy tragedy and low
oomsdy in the Assembly. Mr. Taylor, it is now quite
evident, has a much rougher tongas than the junior
member for Mudgee.

Religion is at a very low ebb in New York.
The great mass of people never go to churoh at all.
Cold, dignified, perfunctory pleaching is now the mode.
And as earnestness died out, so the attendants dis-
appeared from the churches. Preachers upbraid the
backsliders, but as they don’t go to listen, it does not
matter much. Society people hoid Bsnday night re-
ceptions. la a vain effort to suit this habit, and retain
th j worshippers, the Churches abandoned evening
service and substituted the afternoon. But that
failed j it was too soon after dinner. Bo the fashion-
ables give up okuroh, they let time tlip by till oveuirg,
an l then they us >ama elaborate toilets, and skip gaily
off to tne usual Sunday night reception.
A most unseemly squabble occurred in a certain
suburban churoh last Sunday, when the reverend
doctor who bosses the concern, most unceremoniously
endeavoured to oust the organist, who had resented
being •• sat upon ' on a former occasion. The attempt
was made in a voice so outrageously loud and impera-
tive that it attracted the attention of the whole con-
gregation, and matters were carried so far that a
messenger was sent for a policeman, who surveyed the
scene, did no lung, and went away again. Eventually
the service proceeded without the presence of the
obnoxious musician, who has learned the Kssou that
even miuisters.arc not exempt from “petticoat govern-
ment.”
When wo mentioned three weeks ago, that a
C of E. clergyman at Q loan buy an entertained a K.C-
cleric at hie house, it acorns some people imagined we
blamed him. Scarcely. The facts ate here: Arch-
bishop Vaughan was expected on u race day, and tbe
town was over full, not a bed to be had. Father Birch,
meeting the Kov. J. A. Boss, i xpiaiued that he would
have to vacate his own presbytery for the Archbishop
end suite, whereupon Boss, who is a real good tellow,
offered a bed for the night In his parsonage. That's

eon version of the hoatueu—of Ballarat. Ha describes
this principal oily cf his diocese as steeped in
heathenism and poverty. fhe Ballarat people have at
least this la common with the heathen, that they
furiously rage "—at their Bishop’s description of
them. They allege that while he was resident among
them, be was constantly appealing to them for money
to convert the other heathen in the South Baas and
elsewhere, and think that if he believed them to be
sunk in poverty he might have spared bis dunning
sermons; and, if he regarded them as heathens, he
might at least have applied the funds he extracted from
their pockets for their . wa conversion, without ttoub-
ling auout the South Seas.

Wolfe’s Schnapps has for many years enjoyed
the ojntlaouco of Che pvople of Australasia, and id now
far more popular as a beverage tnao any of the ordinary
stimulants of commerce. But beware of counterfeits.
It is said that George E. Sims wrote “ The Way
to Heaven," his latest ballad. In erne night without
erasure or interlineation. Very likely. It was printed
simultaneously in the Eefeueb and N. Y. Spirit This
poem shows, if ever a production uid, the signs of over-
work on the part of the writer. The sentiment is
mawkish, and the subject stale, while the verse is clumsy
to a degree. However, Sims has made his money. Ho
cm now afford to be careless. But continual grinding
out o( copy has given him weak eyes and a shattered
constitution, and marly ail his work is writteu in the
country. His ballads have made his fame; his dramas
his money. As an instance of what dramatists make
now-a-days, we may state that Henry Herman and H,
A. Jones have already cleared jEIO.OiX) by the rights of
“ The Silver King." la the next decade we shad have
fewer clergymen and more dramatists.
Nowhere perhaps has the dentist's art obtained such
high excellence as in Sydney. Certainly we are in no
sense behind any other city. Visitors to Sydney might,
to test this, visit the establishment of Messrs. Adolphe
Gabriel and Company, 18, Wyuward Square, two doors
from Pfahlert's Hotel. Here the manataoturo of every
essential in toe profession is carried on. At the rear of
the surgery is a compact little factory where all the
requisites for supplying every dental defect in the
human month are made. Messrs. Gabriel and Co.
(whose only address Is os above) are always pleased to
show their specimens of artificial teeth to those
interested. There being two firms of the same name in
the Square, patients will oblige by paying particular
attention to the Christian name, Adolphe, and tha num-

SPOUTING AND ATHLETIC MEMS.
The English yacht builder, Fife, has completed
a 5-tonner, intended for shipment to Sydney.
The O’Leary-Edwards walking match comes
off in Sydney. It is for £200 a-side—the dark side.
The Canterbury, N.Z., Jockey Club are offering
big stakes for their next November meeting, and com-
pletely eclipsing the programmes of all the metropolitan
courses in Australia. The N.Z. Cup is to be for a Handi-
cap Parse of 1000 sovs., with a sweep of 20 sovs , whilst
the Canterbury Cap will ba a weight-for age race for
500 sovs.
A race for .£50 a side, between Clifford and
Pearce, in watermen’s skiffs, was rowed on the river on
Saturday, and resulted in a win for Clifford, after one
of the most exciting races ever palled on that course
Clifford got away with the start, and simply rawed
Pearce clean out, winning by about six lengths. Time,
29 min. 50sec.
There was a hitch in the Layoock-Rush match.
Layoook, who is in charge of tho Quarantine Station,
Shark Island, was refused leave of absence, and
unless Rush agreed to pull on tho Parramatta River—a
most unlikely thing for him to do—Layoook would have
had to forfeit tho £200 already paid down. Leave has,
however, now been granted.
Mr. Alexander Rogers, of Attunga, has suffered
a severe loss by Camilla, the dam of the well-known
horse Barber, breaking her neck. Barber is by The
Barb. The mare was again being sent to the •* black
demon” when she met with the aooident. While in
camp for the night, she was hobbled, and in attempting
to jump a log met her fate.
Tho following handicap has been made by
Messrs. P J. Clark and N. Lookyer in tho sculling
match at Grafton: —Edward Trickett and W. Beach,
scratch; Donald M'Donald, 2 lengths; John Largan, 3
lengths; C. A. Messenger, 4 lengths; Neil M'Donald, 4
lengths; George Perkins, 5 lengths; A. Campbell, 6
lengths; A. Baker, 7 lengths.
Immediately after the last match played against
the Englishmen, the Australian: Eleven disbanded. A
division of the profits of the whole tour throuoh Eng-
land, America, and the colonies was made a couple of
days ago, each man receiving between £600 and £700
as his share. The Australians cleared nearly £200 per
man in the three test matches played against Mr. Bligh's
team.
The Melbourne police are getting more and
more supremely virtuous, and consequently the sweep
promoters are getting more and more •* particular fits "

day by offering to pay a fine of £10 10a., and £10 10s.
costs ; but " the party by tho name of ” Achilles under-
took to argue with the beaks, which legal luxury cost
him a £50 fine.
Says a N.Z. paper:—The Rob inaon-Lanoe con-
federacy has been more firmly cemented by the marriage
of H. P. Lanoe, Esq , with the Hon. W. Robinson’s
fourth daughter. The marriage was very quiet. As a
Southern contemporary says :—“ The stable has always
been a dangerous one, but now it must be regarded as
more so, for with the Hon. W. Robinson’s money, and
Mr. H. P. Lance’s experience at homo and in tha
colonies it looks as if they intended to carry all before
them ”
J. A. Kennedy, of Portland, America, is
matched to row Hanlan a three-mile race, with turn,
time and place not yet agreed upon, for £500 a side. In
the articles of agreement, tha methods of choosing the
course and the referee were plainly set forth, but no
mention whatever was made of the day. month, or year
on which tho race sh til be rowed, nor of the method by
which the date should be agreed upon. la plain Eng-
lish, these so-called article3 are utterly worthless, and
it at any future time either Hanlan or Kennedy should
for any reason wish to give up the match, ha cm do so
by simply refusing to accept any date named by his
opponent.
The following men have been picked to repre-
sent this colony on April 28th, in tue Intercolonial 8-
oar race : — Messrs. Middleton. Moopott, E Simpson,
C. Bros, Broclio, G. Qaden, R Bedford, and J. Thomson,
being the same crew that was suocesful last year on the
Yarra, except that Mr. Middleton takes the place of
Mr. Johnson. The emergency men are Messrs. Robert-
son, Walker, and C. Williams. The Victorian crew
contains only two of the men that were in the defeated
crew last year, Messrs. Upward and Senior. None of
tbe other six have ever rowel in an intercolonial boat-
race. This will be the first race in which a crew has
rowed in a Sydney-built boat.
The Hurdle Raoe at Newcastle was alone worth
the entrance money. It was a race for amateur riders,
and there were four starters — Satellite, Thurnby,
Merton, and Topper. Merton, with Mr Edward Terry
in tho faddle, was winning when ho fell, and was too
smart for his rider, who was only slightly shaken, to
mount him. Satellite declined a fence, and Thumbv
won by quarter of a mile from Topper, Satellite follow-
ing seine time after. And now began the fun. Thurnby.
when welching in, was found to bo 61b, short, and
Topper 8ib.; so Satellite! was declared the winner.
There was fearful uproar, which was only heightened by
tho admission of the riders of Topper and Thurnby
that their instructions were to hold back and led
Satellite baulk.
Fears are entertained that the leading French
racing event, the Grand Prize of Paris, will soon be dis-
continued. The annual appropriation therefor for 1883
was barely passed. The Municipal Council of Paris re-
cently voted the accustomed annual subsidy of 4000f. to
the principal nautical associations of the capital, which
the Cercle de la Voile de Paris, the Rowing Club de
Paris, the Corcle Nautique de France, and the Sooi’te
Nautique de la Marne. The sum is evidently divided
between tho four. There was no opposition offered ;
ibut when the sums allowed to the Sooiete d’Encourage-
ment wore proposed the discussion became warm, and
-the stale arguments against racing as most immoral
were brought to bear. Finally, however, the subsidy
waa successfully passed by 43 votes out of 66.
W. G. George, the English champion runner,
'has been beaten in a ten-mile race by J. T. Delaney, of
America, to whom he allowed three minutes. The race
does not admit of more than a very brief description.
In the three minutes which he was allowed by George,
.Delaney ran nearly five laps, and throughout the raoe
there was little change in their relative positions,
neither passing the other, although at different stages
running in close company, until the last lap, when
Delaney went by with a rush and finished in great style
a race that was a credit to him. Tho mile-times which
are faster than previous records arc as follow : Six
miles, George, 33tniu 30sec.; seven miles, George,
39mm. 21 l-Sseo.; eight miles, George and Delaney,
45mm. llsec.; nine miles, Delaney, Slmiu. 5iec.; ten
miles Delaney 56min. 92 5ieo.
At a recent meeting*, the Inter-Collegiate Foot-
ball Association of America made some necessary
changes in the rules. These amendments bid fair to
abolish the ’’ block " or •• baby " game, and also to pre-
jent foagh play. Hereafter the safety touchdown will
be the unit of scoring. A touchdown equals two
safeties, a goal kicked from the field equals five safeties,
and a goal kicked from a touohtown equals six safeties.
In case of a tie on other points, the side scoring two
more safety touchdowns than its opponent will be
awarded tha game; otherwise it will be a draw. This
renders the safety game useless, and will make the
future collegiate play more like the English Rugby
Union game. Hereafter two warnings, instead of three,
will disqualify a player, and warnings will be given for
unfair tackling, or for jumping on an opponent when
down. In punting out from a touchdown the kicker is
allowed six feet on the goal-line.

A N.Y. paper says “ At a benefit taken by
Allen in New York recently, crowds congregated under
the impression that Sullivan was to ‘ wind up’ with the
beneficiary, la actual fact, Allen had arranged to spar
with Eooke. Sullivan hoard that his name had boen
used as a draw to the entertainment, and made up his
mind to be present and have a little turn on his own
acoount. And he did it. When Allen and Rooke, ■ in
full ring costume,’ came on to the platform, they found
that an unexpected diversion had occurred, and that
they had to play second fiddle. Here is a description of
what happened. At this moment a man, wearing heavy
clothing and a sealskin cap, elbowed hia way through
the audience. His moustache was black as a raven’s
wing, his complexion was the bloom of youth, and his
eyes were bright and fierce. He sprang to the platform
like a cat, and, as he removed his cap, the audience re-
alised that tho champion of all the champions, John L.
Sullivan, was there. There waa a terrrifle shout of
welcome. Throe cheers were proposed for him, and they
were given with a power that made the gallery tremble.
Sullivan addressed the audience, and wound up bv
saying: ‘They have bean sc luring the world to flad
someone to whip me, and they haven’t found him yet.’’’
About two thousand persons visited Madison-
square Garden, Now York city, on Monday evening,
December 18, to witness the oatch-as-oatch-oan wrest-
ling match between Joseph Acton and Clarence
Whistler. It was a match in which the flue science aud
surprising quickness of the former wire opposed to tha
greater waight and immense strength of tho latter,
who, although having improved in his knowledge of
the art since ho first appeared before tbe public, is no
match for Aoton in wrestling ability. Under such cir-
cumstances it was to bo expected that the almost cor-
tain result of such a meeting would bo indecisive and
unsatisfactory. Such proved to bo the case. Aoton,
the smaller and lighter man, found himself obliged to
do all the real wrestling, his more powerful antagonist
refusing to make play, but remaining on the defensive
throughout, and thereby preventing himself being
thrown and beaten, as he must have been had he given
his opponent tho same chances as the latter gave him.
Finally, after they had been engaged nearly two hours,
including resting spells, a draw was mutually agreed
upon, and after venting their dissatisfaction in hisees
and other marks of disapprobation, the dissatisfied
spectators dispersed, and those interested divided tho
gate money.
According to an American paper, the sail-carry-
ing capacity of our open boats is small compared with
that of the centreboard boat of America. It says tha
28-foot open centreboard sloop is the fastest vessel in
the world, except the catamaran. Assuming that two
minutes to the foot over a twenty-mile course is a fair
allowance, she can give time to all beneath her in size,
and over courses where she can sail, the hundred-ton
schooner cannot afford to give her allowance It
would seam, however, that this class of boat will soon
become obsolete, and it is about as well that this should
be so, for they are of no use to their owners unless
they be professionals Only an expert can sail a boat
28.’t long in hull, and spreading over 70ft. of canvas
from Infl of jib to ieech of mainsail. When snob craft
are kept as racing machines, with a professional skipper
and crew, those boats are well enough, and their
owners, like the owners of tho narrow racing cutters of
Great Britain, may gamble on their performance, but
never sail in them ; but in America, of late years, there
has sprung up a demand for a class of boat that the
owner can sail himself. Tho professional skipper and
crew become an unmitigated nuisance, and they have
happily become almost a thing of the past. This type
of boat survives, however, in the clubs, but with rig
reduced to the safety limit
America has brought forth another wonderful
shot, who promises to equal, if not excel. Dr Carver.
One of his latest shots is described as follows: —A piece
of half-inch gaspipe was inserted through a heavy pieoa
of iron as a base At one end of the pipe ha affixed
the blade of a hatchet, so that the sharp edge rested
against the pipe. On either side of the hatchet he hung
a glass ball. Standing off at a distance of forty feet,
he fired with a Winchester repaating.rifla at the ex.
posed end of the gaspipe, through which the ballet
passed and was split on tho hatchet edge, each half
breaking the glass ball on either side of the hatchet.
Having done this remarkable shot to his satisfaction in
the ordinary off-hand way, he tried it in a different
manner. Holding the gun over his shoulder, he sighted
through a small mirror ho held in his left hand and
fired with his back to tho object. Again did the ball
pass through the gaspipe, split on the hatchet-edge, and
break both balls. Still another way was tried Send-
ing over, he held the rifle down and sighted under his
leg, again making the shot successfully. Shooting
glass balls thrown in the air, holding the rifle in his
right hand and shooting at arm’s length, shooting a
swallow in its swift flight, are all common amusement
for him.
Tom Kelly, the veteran pugilist, and the second
of Ryan in his fight with Sullivan, being asked what he
thought of Tom Allen’s chances, proviuing he met the
Bastou boy, said: “I wouldn’t give that for his
chances,” and he snapped his fingers “ There was a
time when Allen could put up a good fight, but that
time has gone by, and it will take a good fight to settle
Sullivan. When I went to New Orleans and met Snlli-
van and Ryan, I sized the two up, and I made up my
mind that Sullivan had a pudding; but I had gone down
to handle Ryan and said nothing, but waited my chance,
and when it came I threw up the sponge. This man
Sullivan is the garaest man in tha country to-day, and
the hardest hitter.” “ What do you suppose he is going
to do in Chicago P” “ I see that Allen was booked for
a sparring match there, and it may be that Sullivan’s
coming means that they are going to get np a slugging
match between the two. If such a thing happens Sulli-
van will have things all his own way. I tell you, my
boy, it’s cruel to put np such a duffer against a good
man. Now, there was Tug Wilson ; it’s a wonder Sulli-
van didn’t kill him, for he’s only a booth sparrer. Now
they talk about bringing Alf. Greenfield, the English
heavy-weight, over here. If they fetch him there will
be a murder, for Alf’s hands are all gone, and he put
away his fighting clothes some years ago. I see by tho
papers that Mace is on his way here. He’d batter turn
around and go home again. If he was the man he was
twenty years ago Sullivan would have no walk-over,
but to-day I’ll bet £100 to a penny that Sullivan wilt
knock him out in less than forty minutes; perhapi he
will last that long, but it he does ho’U be a hard sight
a very hard sight. I see that Billy Maddea has gone to
England to get a man to fight Sullivan. He has seen
William England, of Cannington, and William Kailton,
of the same place, and either one of the two will train
down to 190. Ton find few good fighters at that weight.
Big men like them always lack the hard-hitting quali-
ties, and so the chances are that, if they come this
way, Sullivan will make a chopping-block of them. If
they want a man to whip Sullivan let them pick out a
youug fellow of his weight, and then let them train him
from the jump. Give him an easy fight or two, and
then send him slap at Sullivan. There are some of this
kind on this side, and the sooner those who are hunt-
ing for a match for Sullivan find this cut the better it
will be for them.”
BICYCLING.
THE WHEEL.
See the wheeler with his wheel,
Silent wheel.
How many murderous thoughts pass through our
minds as past he steals;
As he glides along the pave
With the silence of the grave,
And the crystallinio glittering of the nickel-plated
steel
Bursts upon th’ enraptured sight,
As it flashes dazzling bright.
Till tho gamins with delight
(Which the ordinary mortal and pedestrian cannot
feel),
Yell out, •* See the blooming hijit on hia altitood’nons
wheel,
Of his lofty and exalted and volooipedic wheel,
Of his wheel, wheel, wheel, wheel, wheel, wheel, wheel.
Of his lofty and velocipedio wheel.’’
Hear the tinkling of his bell.
Little bell,
Aa it warns the folks to give him room before he rings
their knell.
And he dings it all the while.
With a feeble, vacant smile,
As he works his number twelves in a rhythmic kind of
style.
And the people, ah I they think.
When they hear that tinkle tink,
*' Here comes old Darwin’s lost one I here comes the
missing link.”
And they positively feel
Like smashing up his wheel.
And implanting on his pantaloons some wounds that
would not heal,
That would cause him to stand upright as he takes his
midday meal,
And would give him heaps of trouble as ho sat upon his
wheel,
On his wheel, whael, wheel, wheel, wheel, wheel, wheel.
On his mokel-platad, highly-polished wheel.
W. D. Wilmot, an American bicyclist, gave the
finest exhibition of fancy riding ever seen in America
at Boston. Wilmot was clad in black trunks, blue and
wine-colour shirt and cap, and bestrode a 52in machine.
The first part ef the exhibition consisted in the tricks
done by fancy bicycle-riders. An attendant sent the
machine ahead and Wilmot mounted while it was
going. He then went through all the mounts and
pedal movements, vaults, riding aide-saddlo in circles,
right and left, the last very difficult and original. Two
satchels were now placed thr«e feet apart in the centre
of the floor, and the rider pass-id between them kneel-
ing on his saddle. Jumping off the bicycle, he took a
satohel in each hand and remounted without stopping
tha machine. Another feat was lying on the backbone
of the machine, body horizontal and toes nnder the
handle bar. Next, spider act, the movements of
which were difficult, and were almost entirely
original. Wilmot here showed himself to be a fine
equilibrist, and pet farmed the different balancing on
spoke, saddle and rim of the machine, crawling
over every part of the bicycle, with perfection
and without a miss. The eas i with which he performed
these feats made it seem as if the bicycle was glued to
the floor. Such movements as tho following are a fair
sample of the performance : Sitting on handle with feet
on tire, arms folded, then sitting on pedal with arms
folded and one foot in small and one in large wheel.
With the bicycle at a staud-still ho dropped his hand-
kerchief and picked it up without a particle of his
person touching the ground. After this the rider rode
a 41.inch machine, beginning by riding on the large
wneel only, small wheel in the air for a considerable
distance. He then brought in another bicycle, same
size, and after riding them aronnd the hall brought
them to a standstill, interlocked them and stood erect
on one of the saddles without support. Still another
biejele was introduced, and tho rider rode around on
one with another in each hand, manipulating them with
apparent ease. Ha brought them to a stop, interlocked

At St. Stephen’s Church, Newtown, last Thurs-

Miss Ada Tighe, daughter of the member for Northum-
berland. The bride looked charmingly pretty In cream
satin, orange and jasmine wreath, bouquet of roses and
maidenhair; and was attended by six maids, two in pale
blue, two in cream, and two in pink, all made alike—the
dresses we mean—and trimmed with Breton laoe. All
wore forget-me-not wreaths and tulle veils. Miss Mabel
Tighe acted as chief bridesmaid. A goodly number of
valuable presents were given. Mr. and Mrs. Tighe gave
a party at “ Waratah,” Petersham, in the evening, when
some pretty dresses appeared. Two cousins of the bride
from N iwcibtle, a handsome roaepink from Summer
Hill, a Petersham pale blue, and a Wollahra pink satin
and pearls were noticeably handsome. Mrs. Tighe
donned a dark green silk with same hued laoe, while the
handsome wife of an M.F. wore black broohe and satin,
and Mrs. Angus, senior, blaok brochtS Bilk and Spanish

A very gratifying gathering befell the Peter-
sham Owls on Tuesday night. We don’t know whoso
fault it was they did uot start the programme before
half past eight, but it was everyone’s misfortune to
Lave to sutler a dreary delay. Varied selections of
music were given, and Mr. F. Bird’s violin playing
gained him kudos, which is the French for stamping
your heels on the floor and saying, “ Keep it up,"
Bignor Pft'ndini sang several pieces; so did Signor
Andrew Fairfax, whoso lady accompanist was allowed
to descend the steps to her seat alone, until a gentle-
man ran to offer the aid which the Dignified One filled
to give. Miss Marie Ht Clair was warmly praised for
two ballads, “ Break, break, break," and “ Out on the
rocks." Muss St. Clair's toilette was a good adaptation
of Mrs. Langtry's, as seen in the familiar photographs;
her pale pink dross, easily fitting, 1* ft the neck bare,
the edges being simply turned i i over each shoulder
and brought down iu an open V shape on the breast.
Her hair was in a short thick roll coming down on to
the neck behind, while the front had an artfully
managed appearance of anybowuess ; the style alto-
gather suiting her well. We won’t say how well, in
case it might reach Mrs. Langtry, and prevent her
coming to this country. At the end of the concert,
light refreshments were diffused, and then dancing
was enjoyed for a couple of hours,

THE FLIRT.

The sweetest flower.
And waits for sweeter coming.
That, when it’s softest singing.
With a lock so bright.

The excessive splendour of Sara Bernhardt’s
dresses In *• Feodora" has climaxed anything aver seen
on the stage, and indeed, there have been protects that
dressmakers threaten to nsnrp the stage of tbe drama-
tists. There is open fear that the time is coming
when tbe mission of the great playwrights will be, net
to compose dramas of genius, but to provide frames in
whieh Worth and his compeers will exhibit the
triumphs of millinery. The question will be, not who is
the author, but who made the dresses. In dara’s case,
the dresses in ‘‘Feodora" became almost an international
question, for when a Viennese modiste made some of
them, all Paris talked of it, and half Paris waxed indig-
nant. Worth made her four for that play, yet after all
the divine but tickleminded Shadow would not wear two
of them at the last moment —a pala blue satin brocaded
with violets, and a ball dress of roe* and silver. But
such whims are allowable to each whimmeu.

No matter where—we met them ;
They were, in sooth, a bizarre lot,
And wo shant soon forget them I
A girl it was whose hulking “ chap ”

We saw her face—’twas fair bnt thin—

And lo 1 he hit her with his shoe I
“ Stop, tend I" we cried, “now don't you dare
That sweet girl to assault her I
Or we will quickly put you where
You’ll gee the • oat ’ or halter.
You ruffian I quick I I charge you, cease—
Hi 1 murder! Help here 1 stop thief!—PTloe!”
“ You wretch I you’d lumber then my Ben,”
Of this she was a hisser ;

There is another article of colonial production
which is winning its way solely on its merits. It is
Koumiss. There are many thousands who cannot
arink milk without having the attendant luxury ot in-
digestion. Well Koumiss is milk in a digestible form.
People in the feeblest health may thus get the most
nutritious food. And besides, Koumiss is as efferves-
cent as champagne, and is most refreshing. The leading
physicians of Sydney are ordering it for their patients,
particularly those suffering from debility or con-
sumption.
The cash system of business, which is becoming
Senei al all over the metropolis, and in fact throughout
F.8.W., is imparting doable the stability to trade.
This grand result must be largely ascribed to the
vigorous and courageous manner with which the sys-
tern was adopted and developed by Mr. W. B. Campbell,
founder of the Royal Furnishing Arcade, Sydney. This
was about nine years ago. People will remember how
trade was conducted then, and will appreciate the
change. By the way, Messrs Campbell Bros., bear
testimony to the wonderful results of advertising the r
house furnishing lists in The Bulletin The lists
have been out out of the paper and sent to Sydney from
all parts of this colony and Queensland, and have
proved of thorough usefulness to the public.

the age of 80, universally respected, and measuring
nine feet in circumference, and weighing 4621b. He could
only lie on his side, his bead had to be bolstered to keep

ways as freight and paid by the hundredweight There
was only one way he could lie without being bolstered
up—and that was sitting down.
