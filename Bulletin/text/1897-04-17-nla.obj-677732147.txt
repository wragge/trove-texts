Soon the wan, the wistful stars,

Elves of light, on beamy bars,
Whisper then, and wake her I

I arise from dreams of thee
In the first sweet sleep of night,
When the winds are breathing low,
And the stars are shining bright;
I arise from dreams of thee,
And a spirit in my feet
Hath led me —who knows how?—
To thy chamber window, sweet 1
The wandering airs, they faint
On the dark, the silent stream ;
The champak odors fail
Like sweet thoughts in a dream}
The nightingale’s complaint.
It dies upon her heart,
As I must die on thine,
O beloved as thou art!
O, lift me from the grass I
I die! I faint! I fail!
Let thy love in kisses rain
On my lips and eyelids pale.
My cheek is cold and white, alas!
My heart beats loud and fast;
Oh, press it close to thine again,
Where it will break at last 1

Notes and Queries.
[lt i» proposed to take advantage of Tus Bulletin’s
unique Australasian circulation to collect, information
from all manner of readers and observers on all manner
of curious and interesting subjects. Preference will be
given to notes and queries which are especially Austra-
lasian, or kin with Australasian, in their origin and
reference —particularly to those dealing with aboriginal
life and language, natural history, whifce-Australasiao
language, customs, exploits, and typical developments,
characteristic olu-time anecdotes, and so on. As space is
limited, brevity of statement is essential. Writers must
observe the ordinary correspondence conditions. The
help of The Bulletin readers everywhere is asked in
recording some of the many valuable facts, impressions,
or experiences which will otherwise be lost to our
country. Any relevant information will be welcome,
even if not precisely' answering the queries. Contribu-
tions must be endorsed ‘ Notes and Queries,’ and the
number of the question and date of issue must be
added. All references to books should state title,
author, publisher, date of publication, place where pub-
lished, and pages quoted from ; and all records of personal
experience should give date, place (province, district,
miles from nearest post-town), and other helpful details.
The first batch of queries is culled from some which have
recently reached Tiir Bulletin.]
NOTE.—I. Red Hair.
The red-headed person seems to have pecu-
liarly intense vitality, together with a low
power of resistance to strain, involving a
high death-rate as if the unusual exaltation
brought a corresponding depression during which
disease-germs readily found lodgment. A red-
headed person marks the extreme of the light-
haired classes (passing the albino as comparatively
exceptional), so the qualities with which I credit
him agree with the observations collated by
Havelock Ellis (‘ Man and Woman,’ p. 225 et sq.)
tending to show that there is a progressive diminu-
tion of fair people in Europe, and that women are
darker-haired than men —their pigmentation being
probably connected with their less intense but
tougher vitality. Ellis quotes Dr. Alice Ross
(‘Med. and Surg. Reporter,’ Oct., ’92): ‘ln red-
haired women and those brunettes who have red
lips, red cheeks, and are inclined to freckle rather
than to tan, lacerated perineum and cracked
nipples occur most frequently.’
Dr. F. N. Manning, N.S. YV. Inspector-General
of the Insane, tells me there are not many red-
haired persons in the asylums under his charge.
He estimates the proportion of red-heads to the
general N.S.W. population at about 4 per cent. —
which is the projiortion found, according to Dr.
Beddoes, ‘the chief authority on this subject,’
among the lower classes in London (Ellis, ‘ The
Criminal,’ p. 76). But the proportion of red-
heads in N.S.W. insane asylums is only about
2 per cent., and there are more dark-haired than
light-haired among the inmates.
Dr. Manning noticed when a surgeon in the
marines that red-heads make good soldiers, which
substantiates the ‘ ginger for pluck’ idea. Pluck,
ex hy<iothesi, would naturally follow on a red-
head’s abounding vitality. But this very vitality,
it seems, makes Dr. Manning dislike red-headed
nurses. They have ‘ too much zeal,’ are too
boisterous, exercise a disturbing influence in a
sick-room.
Ellis (‘The Criminal,’p. 77) says that of 1220
insane persons in the New Brunswick asylum the
hair of 1050 was described as ‘dark,’ ‘dark brown,’
‘brown,’ while 170, or a little less than 1£ per
cent., had ‘light,’ ‘auburn,’or ‘red’ hair. And
he proceeds, summing up this and previous evi-
dence (which, however, is not full enough to be
conclusive) —
One person in seven among the insane has fair hair, one
in five among criminals; one person in fifty among the
insane has red hair, one in 129 among the criminals;
one in forty among the insane has auburn hair,
cne in 129 among the crimiuials. So that while
the proportion of fair - haired is distinctly smaller
among the insane, the proportion of red-haired and
auburn-haired is very decidedly larger than among the
criminals. So far as exact evidence on the color of the
hair goes, it points chi fly to a relative deficiency of red-
haired persons among criminals. This may, perhaps, be
accounted for. There seems to be a lessened power of
resistance to disease among persons of brilliant pigmenta-
tion. The extensive anthropological statistics of the
American War showed a very marked inferiority on the
part of fair persons. . . . Our evidence as to the propor-
tion of bright-haiied people in lunatic asylums seems to
point in this direction. These r-d-haired people, wilh
their ‘sanguine’ temperament of body, are peculiarly
susceptible to zymotic disease ; they take scarlet fever,
for instance, very easily, and suff. r fr«-m it severely*
Among the manifold risks of a criminal life the brightly
pigmented person, with his sensitive vascular system,
seems to be soon eliminated.
The high vitality of red-heads is naturally fol-
lowed by noticeable sexual activity, I have never
known a red-headed old bachelor or old maid.
Why is the red-head a mark for the opprobrium
of children? At school he is invariably known as
‘ Ginger,’ or ‘ Carrots,’ or (more reeonditely)
‘Coppertop.’ Is it merely that he is rare and
remarkable, or is there in him some characteristi-
cally red-headed element which wins hostility?—
SCHREIBZKUG.
[The red-headed male and girl have evidently left
large footprints on the sands of time and literature,
and further red-headed facts, observations, or **,*»
pressione will be welcome.]
QUERIES.
2. ‘The Never-Never,’ or ‘Never Never Coun-
try.’ To what part of Australia precisely is this
phrase applied? and why? Who originated it?
and when was it first printed ? —T.S.S.
3. In ‘Queenslander’ of 20/3/97 A. Meston
writes—‘No kind of spear ever hisses or whistles,
or makes any noise whatever, except in the writ-
ing of people profoundly ignorant of the whole
subject. The fast-driven woomera spear passes
in perfect silence through the atmosphere, and
would pass unheard within an inch of the most
sensitive ear. Arrows are equally silent. There-
fore the “ hiss ” and “ whistle ” of spears and
arrows exist only in the imagination of those who
have only seen them in a museum, people who are
also ignorant of ordinary laws governing the flight
of projectiles.’ Are these statements and their
implications invariably correct ?—D.R.
4. ‘ls the joey born on the teat?’—Back-
blocksman. [Many statements on this still-dis-
puted question have already been printed in The
Bulletin, but they are scattered over a con-
siderable time and space. It is desired now to
concentrate available information on the subject;
and quotations from the book-authorities, as well
as observations from eye-witnesses, are sought.]
5. Who named Australia ?—J. T. Warris.
6. Where, when, and by whom was the first
Australian theatre (so called) erected ? What
piece was p'ayed on the opening night, and what
was the cast?—Stockwhip.
T. B. Saunders issues the half-dozenth volume
of his translations from Schopenhauer— ‘ On
Human Nature’ (posted, Ss.). If not quite so
bright as one or two of those preceding, it is still
eminently readable. Schopenhauer was an acute,
cotnmon-sensy philosopher who did not argue to
pet theories, but took things as they came, and
made the best or the worst of them just as the
case appeared to demand. If he brings Ahriman
on top nine times out of ten, it is only because
Ahriman is on top nine times out of ten. And
Schopenhauer was a very human animal—ex-
tenuating nothing, and setting down a great
deal in malice. The present volume, besides the
considerations classed under the tide, includes
reflections on ‘ Government,’ on ‘ Free Will and
Fatalism,’ on ‘Character,’and on ‘Moral Instinct’
with a lot of little reflections on various subjects.
* « * *
Authors’ histories of ‘My First Book,’ re-
printed from ‘The Idler,’ make really a very
entertaining vohnno in the new illustrated
edition (posted, 4s. 3d.) Kipling and Stevenson
are represented, Bret Harte and Zangwill,
Robert Buchanan, Hall Caine, and Conan Doyle
—and a dozen others, who all find something
interesting to say. The illustrations are particu-
larly good. Stevenson recommends everybody to
write with a map and an almanack—having him-
self come to grief with his moon in ‘ Prince Otto.’
* With a map before him, a man will scarce allow
the sun to set in the east, as it does in
“The Antiquary.” With the almanack at hand,
he will scarce allow two horsemen, journeying on
the most urgent affair, to employ six days, from
three of the Monday morning till late in the
Saturday right, upori a journey of, say, ninety or
a hundred miles, and before the week is out, and
still on the same nags, to cover fifty miles in a
day, as may be read at length in the inimitable
novel of “Rob Rov.” ’
• * * *
Nansen’s ‘Farthest North’ (Macmillan & Co.)
looks formidable in its two volumes and 800
pages, but it is not really one of those snares in
which publishers trap unwary readers with the bait
of a boom. Nansen is a fine, manly fellow who wins
your heart at once, and even in the multiplicity
of petty details which crowd his volumes there is
warm personal charm. And his business as ex-
plorer lie seetns to know better than any who have
preceded him. His success is rather a pill for the
expert English prophets of failure, but they have
gulped it admirably. Posted from BULLETIN

The first issue of ‘The Literary Year-Book
promises more than it perforins. The criticisms
might be made of permanent value, and the
Burvey of publications should be much wider and
more thorough. Still, even what is given was
badly wanted ; and the Year-Book evidently has
a future. The. portraits and notices of authors
lighten it agreeably. There is a specially curious
picture of W. B, Yeats, a gaunt, glassed, hollow-
cheeked, forehead-wrinkled, night-haired, open-
mouthe I poet who looks as if he was posing as the
embodiment of the Celtic spirit.
Small Change.
Justin M'Carthy is bringing ‘ A History of uur Own
Times ’ almost up to date-to publish in a month or two.
George Grey seems to have won the good opinion of
honest people wherever he went. Olive Schreiner dedi-
cates to him ‘Trooper Peter HaDet,’ as to ‘ a Great Good
Man who, during his rule in South Africa, bound to him-
self the Dutchmen, Englishmen, and natives he governed
by an incorruptible justice and a broad humanity, and
who is remembered among us to-day as representing the
noblest attributes of an Imperial rule.’
Australian Dr. George Morrison’s pluck and pen have
won him the post of Loud. Times correspondent in China.
Paperknife: ‘Aldrich’s true poem, “ My Goddess," sug-
gesting De Musset’s “Muse,” has the base of Emerson on
compensation, showing that every gain involves its loss,
and otherwise. So Goethe writes “ Take what you want,
and pay the price,” and I lately found the Aldrich idea
in a fine anonymous poem called “The Tormentor.”
Octave Feuillet was almost worried to death over his
rivalry of himself. Suppose Dickens had continued
poor 1 ’
Re. : 'Re Kipling's “speokshioner,” the equivalent
German nautical expression is “speckschneider," literally,
“fat-cutter.” Talking of Kipling, what would happen
to a Bulletin poet who did this ?
“ His tire was leaky of tongue and pen,
His dam was a clucking Khussuck hen.
And the colt bred close to the vice of each,” etc.'
[Kipling is by no means flawless, though straws of cavil
are swept away in his vigorous flood. A writer in To-
Dav instances ‘ Follow Me 'Ome,' in the last book of
verses. ‘ Lines three and four read
*• But I strook ’im cruel ’ard, an’ I wish I 'adn't now,
Which is just what a man oaa't do.”
“Can’t do” what? Can’t “wish ’e’adn’t”? Again,
lines seven and eight read :
“ But I’d give my pay and stripe for to get the beggar
back.
Which it's just too late to do.”
Too late to “give ’is stripe and pay”? How had that
ever been possible, and, if it had never been possible, how
cou'd it be “ too late ” ? If the lines “ just what a man
can’t do," and “just too late to do” were transposed,
the meaning would seem to me much clearer; and I had
expected to find it so when the poem appeared in a book,
fancying that possibly the reading given was a printer's
error when it first appeared a couple of years ago. Ap-
parently, however, the author’s intention was to write it
so. Possibly he is intentionally suggesting a certain in-
consequence of thought, due to the turmoil in the
mourner’s mind.’}
ILL.: ‘Are a majority of magazine and newspaper
illustrators left-handed? If not, why do they so often
put the lady rider on the wrong side of her escort, her
legs on the wrong side of the horse, the driver on the
wrong side of the cart, and the whole business, wherever
possible, on the wrong side of the street? A recent Bul-
letin was left-handed all through—with the exception of
‘ Hop,’ who is generally right-handed, if he does occasion-
ally give a swagman a stick. There was a boy holding up
left hand in school, a man pointing over left shoulder at
left-handed poster, an Irishman digging potatoes with
left hand and foot on the spade, and so on. Even in as
illustrated advertisement of the pantomime nine-tenths
of the ballet held their wands and lances in the left
hand. Why?’
A.M.: ‘lf the indeterminate-gender pronoun difficulty
cannot be overcome by simply presupposing the mascu-
line, and the se-sim-sU pronoun is really required, it—or
its equivalent—will sooner or later come to stay. Utility
is, in the long run, invariably too strong for sentimental
or aesthetic objections. Even Swift's ridicule couldn’t
kill “ ambassador ” and “ amusement,” and for those who
declaim against any neonism as impossible there should
be a lesson in Addison’s hesitating supposition that the
“ mob ’’-abbreviation of “ mobile ” might not impossibly
some day take its place “ even in legitimate language." ‘
What an appetite some Americans have for tedious
little details about Washington, Lincoln, and Co. ! There
are hundreds of lives of G.W. ; the little known of him
has been said in every possible shape; yet the most
modern magazines never tire of saying it all over again.
‘M‘Cliire’s’ is now printing the most insignificant re-
miniscences regarding Gru.t—a second-rate man in point
of mental capacity, hut brought to the front by his physi-
cal grit, endurance, obstinacy. There must be a public
for such matter, or it would not get printed. Probably
the public exists chiefly among the brooding agricultural
classes, cherishing heroic kinship.
M. Rule: * I see a song, “Love, I Will Love You Ever,"
by F. Desprez. Is it by the author of “ Lasca”?’
C. R. ; ‘You say “Allan Upward, flctionist and dra-
matist, is preparing a novel novel —all in verse.” Not
quite a novel novel. There is the late Lord Lyttoo's
“ Lucile.” *
THE SHARK.
They tell us, when a vessel is at sea,
That ever in its wake a single shark,
Patient and tireless, follows silently
Watching for prey. So, out of each man's past
Some sin forgotten follows his life's bark,
And if he slip, devours him, at the last.
‘ John-a-Dreamt.

COUOHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis uure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my ease every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I nm now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.’’
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused tne great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success. I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.’’
We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed

whole nervous and muscular systems, and builds up a
new constitution in the most enfeebled. The first week of
treatment brings glad relief, and PERSEVERANCE

Should try Dr. SPEER’S celebrated Remedies, which strike
at the root of the disease. The symptoms gradually dis-
appear, vigor and lost health return, sunken eyes retain
their old lustre. The blood-giving principle of the medi-
cine secures a healthy appearance, the patient finds
himself gaining in weight and flesh, hollow and sunken
cheeks become rounded ; the weak and shattered consti-
tution is restored, and the former sufferer finds himself
permanently cured with all the animation and vigor of
iife.

THE CARRION CROW.
Old Sandy M‘Million is mighty of paunch,
His talk is of shoulder and sirloin and haunch,
His sheep in their myriads are dotting the plain,
And to number his herds were a labor in vain ;
But, spite of his airs and his bounce and his brag
As he drives in his buggy past you and your swag,
He’s only a varlet and vassal—for, lo !
True King of the West is the Carrion Crow.
The stoutest of heart and the staunchest of limb
And the daintiest of flesh are a banquet for him ;
There’ll be bleating of lambkins and picking of
eyes
When he drops with a “ Caw ! ” down the creek
on his prize,
And the cattle that fail in the swamp-land shall
feei
Fierce clutching of claws and a beak as of steel,
And the Downs as they droop where the desert
winds blow
Must hail him as Master —the Carrion Crow !
He hunts the grey hawk if he wanders anigh ;
He’s always at hand when the wanderers die ;
A-perch on a fence or a rock or a limb,
He’ll laugh, as you droop, with a humor so grim ;
And never a swagman a mourner shall lack
So long as our bird can appear in his black,
With his dirge for the dying so gentle—“Ho!
Ho !
Here’s luck to the House of the Carrion Crow! ”
And I ween that the Lord of a weariless wing
Who preys on the choicest our pastures can bring,
Who drops by the dying to jibe and to jest,
Who feeds on the hearts of the bravest and best,
I ween he is regal—if regal there be ;
If “ manners make monarchs ” a monarch is he,
And as Monarch I hail him in song—that ye
know
How the West hath a king in the Carrion Crow.
N.Q.
P. LUFTIG.
THE OUTCASTS.
It’s a worn and weary legion that is battling in
the West %
For the truth of some old motto woven round some
family crest,
Skirmishing in scattered order, charging forward
side by side
Underneath the riven banner of the shreds of
family pride;
Our hands are to the axes and our shoulders to the
wheel,
And the daylight never whispers what the silent
nights reveal,
And we drive our dusty treadmill, and we play our
mocking parts,
And there’s no one knows the sorrow that is ach-
ing at our hearts,
If across the sand and sun-glare and the burning
blaze of blue
There’s a home beyond the ocean, and a hope that
holds us true
To the lustre of fine linen and the pride of armor
plates,
And the honor of old elm-trees and the pomp of
lioned gates.
So the lost life lies behind us for the curbless years
of youth
That laughed at shadowed sorrow and made mock
of whispered ruth,
And we lost the sweets of living when our life
was scarce begun,
And we gathered Pleasure’s rosebuds ere they
opened to the sun,
In the Wine or Play that drove us, or the Love that
learned too well
The word that locks us Heaven and lays bare the
path to Hell.
We the stars that guide us and the
jewelled hands that lead,
The whispers in the gloaming and the wildflowers
in the mead,
And down Life’s rocky pathway, while our hearts
are near to break,
We drink the Cup of Bitterness we chose for some-
one’s sake.
Outside dim moonlit gardens we have watched
the light forms tread,
And learned that Love was over and Hope for us
lay dead,
And the great world thunders past us—we hear
the hoofs go by—
While Poverty forbids us live and Pride forbids
us die !
And lighter loves have mocked us, and Passion’s
sheeted ghost
Has glimmered through the mulgas with the pulse
of Passion lost,
And browner hands have clasped us who have laid
those hands aside
For the memory of old meetings and the old un-
bidden pride,
And if there be amongst us some few that pride
hath flown,
God pardon us the broken hearts we’ve laid beside
our own!
Yet through the golden ranges we have tasted
now and then
The glory of our freedom and the strength that
makes us men;
In the scent of eucalyptus that we gather as we
pass,
In the glamor of the Bushland when the dawn-dew
dips the grass;
And a moment we are tempted o’er the lifting seas
between
To fling a gauntlet backward to the men we might
have been.
But through the sunset splendor creep the shadow
and the mist,
The white arms madly fondled and the red lips
madly kissed,
The bitterness of parting and the pain of one
“ good-bye ”
That rings across the starlight with a wail will
never die;
And Death comes very near us, and the hand of
Dark Despair
Is heavy on our heart-beat and her slow breath
chills the air,
And none but God has knowledge how men may
long to feel
The clinging arms of Poison and the kiss of Naked
Steel;
But the pride that wrecked our boyhood and the
pride we learned too late
Will hold us clean and guiltless till the opening of
the Gate.

The BONANZA CIGAR.
DIXSON k SONS, by the aid of newly-invented machinery of surprising capa-
city, have placed upon this market at a Pl’ic© HitllGl'tO XJll“
known Here a Cigar of exceptional quality.
The Finest Cigar Tobacco in tlie World
comes from Havana, and arrangements have been made for supplies from
there of the choicest Tobacco (Vuelta Abajo).
BONANZA Cigars are made of this Tobacco, with a necessary portion of
equallv-ehoice Seed Leaf, and together they form a Cigar second only to the
recognised brands dMiigh-class Havanas.
4 Full-sized Cigars for 6d.!!— win at first no doubt
be prejudicial; but machinery, overcoming the great cost of production, just
permits a Cigar of such quality and weight to be made at a profit, DIXSON
and SONS intend the Bonanza Cigar to illustrate and prove what can be done.
The “ BONANZA ”
comes as a pleasant surprise to many who, though capable of appreciating a
good Cigat, ha\ e lately been pi evented through retrenched circumstances from
indulging in the hitherto expensive luxurv.

SATURDAY, APRIL 17, 1897.
Some Doubtful Points.
The Federal Constitution has, at time of
writing, got through its first stage, and has
left the hands of the drafting committees.
It has next to be considered and argued over
and possibly amended by the Convention as
a whole, and then to go through the same
process at the hands of the various Parlia-
ments, and after that it has to be debated
and re-considered and put into final shape
at a second meeting of the Convention, and
then if it passes the ordeal of a popular vote,
and gets safely through some other stages, it
will become law. So far as it has gone there
are fewer conspicuous foolishnesses in it
than in most constitutions, whether written
or unwritten ; nevertheless, at least half-a-
dozen weak points stick out so conspicuously
that they are visible to almost any eye on a
very casual inspection.
* * * *
One glaringly weak point is the proposal
that the Federal military force cannot legally
enter any state for the purpose of putting
down riot or civil war, except at the request
of the provincial authorities. The object of
this proviso, of course, is to prevent the
Federal Government sending troops into a
state under pretence that civil commotion is
imminent, and keeping them there to over-
awe the State Legislature with some sinister
end in view. The precaution, however, is
not worth the paper it is written on ;
a Federal Government, unscrupulous enough
to break the law by using the military force
which is legally in any state to overawe the
civil authority, will be also quite unscrupu-
lous enough to break the law by sending a
military force illegally into the state. A
somewhat similar proviso in the United
States constitution makes it impossible for
the Federal authority to put down lyncliings
and other disorders, to interfere in the racial
fights and butcheries which arise periodically
in some of the Southern states, and made it
even impossible to legally interfere when an
army of rioters held Chicago and threatened
to reduce that stupendous city to ashes. Tf
the constitution starts considering and
making provision for possibilities of civil
war, it should take into account all the possi-
bilities. It is proposed that the State Minis-
try shall be the only power which can law-
fully call in Federal assistance, therefore it
is assumed—which is utterly absurd—that
the Ministry will necessarily be on the side
of order. Yet it might be that a Ministry
badly defeated at the polls would start the
civil war, and let an armed force loose on its
opponents to prevent them assuming office.
Then it naturally would not call in the
Federal forces, and, according to law, the
Commonwealth Government must stand by
and watch the commotion and murder which
ensued, without any attempt at interference.
* * * *
Again, if any Australian state went in for
bloodshed and revolution, it is quite possible
that the party of disorder might hold the
capital, keep the Ministry under surveillance,
and inform its members that any attempt to
call in Federal aid would mean summary
execution. In that case, also, the requisi-
tion for Federal troops would not be sent,
and the Commonwealth Government could
not legally interfere. Also, a State Ministry
might commit acts which were calculated to
bring about war with a foreign power, and
seeing that the Commonwealth Government
would have to do the fighting when the war
arrived, it should have powers of prompt
interference to enable it to avert the catas-
trophe —which would be distinctly its catas-
trophe. (In the U.S., for example, the state
provokes the quarrel, and the Federal Go-
vernment, which can’t interfere to preserve
order, does the grovel and apology and
pays the indemnity). These possibilities
certainly look very remote, but in pro-
posing any clause dealing with such a sub-
ject the Convention is dealing only with
remote possibilities, and if they are dealt
with at all it should be in a sane and reason-
able fashion. Either the clause should read
that the Federal Government shall have
power to send troops to any part of its terri-
tory entirely at its own discretion, or else it
should be omitted altogether, and the Federal
Government should be left to take whatever
powers it considers necessary. In any case
the suspicion which the proviso suggests
seems utterly foolish and uncalled for. If sub-
ordinate Governments, such as the municipal
councils of Bathurst and Geelong, can live
in safety without any special treaty to pre-
vent them being overawed and coerced by
troops sent from Sydney or Melbourne, then
there is a fair probability that subor-
dinate Governments at Sydney and Mel-
bourne can do the same. If the Australian
can’t trust himself in his Federal capacity
not to levy military execution on himself in
his provincial capacity without a special law
to protect him from himself, then he can’t
trust himself to keep the law that he has
made for his own protection.
* » * *
It is provided in the draft Constitution
that each province, regardless of size and
population, shall have six members in the
Senate. In the Lower House there is to be
one member for each 50,000 people, but no
state is to have less than five members.
Without this last proviso the two least popu-
lous provinces—Westralia and Tasmania—
would start with only three members each,
so in both Houses the smaller states receive
considerable concessions. It would be in-
teresting to know distinctly how these pro-
visions are to affect new states. If Queens-
land, for example, came into the Common-
wealth, and shortly afterwards the long-
expected division into three provinces came
off, would it thereupon send 18 members to
the Upper Federal House and 15 to the
Lower House, and thus have a much larger
vote than New South Wales ? Westralia,
from its mere unwieldiness, must some day
sub-divide into various provinces ; could it
divide itself by its own mutual consent into
six, and thereupon have 36 votes in the
Senate and 30 in the Lower House, and its
great empty wastes thus outvote both New
South Wales and Victoria ? The concession
to the small provinces which exist now may
be necessary to induce them to come into the
Commonwealth, but that is quite a different
thing from granting similar concessions to all
the small provinces which may exist in the
future. The sub-division of the three cum-
bersome and top-heavy states of Queensland,
South Australia, and Westralia is inevitable
by-and-bye, but some definite arrangement
seems necessary to prevent the sub-division
shifting the balance of power right out into
the desert.
* * * •
It is further suggested, in a vague sort of
fashion, that the Federal Senate shall have
a limited power over money bills—that it
shall have authority to amend them so as to
reduce taxation, but not so as to increase it.
Judging by many years experience of the
financial ways of our Parliaments, this idea
should be absolutely reversed ; the Senate
should have power to increase taxation, but
not to reduce it. There is not, and has not
been for many years, one Australasian
Government that dared to levy enough taxa-
tion to meet its requirements. They all
dabble in deficits, and charge current ex-
penses to loans, calling these everyday ex’s
‘ ‘ permanent and reproductive works, ” and
adopt strange shady expedients to avoid un-
pleasant responsibility. To create two
Houses with power to reduce taxation and
only one with power to increase it, in a
country which is run on these lines, is a
huge anomaly. And to give any House
power to hunt, for transient popularity by
reducing a tax, without imposing on it also
the responsibility of creating a new one to
fill the gap thus made in the Treasury, is a
one-sided way of doing things The Upper
House, by this device, can create deficits
while the Lower House, which is to have
the management of the finances, will be
responsible for them and have to bear the
obloquy of them ; and no scheme built on
such lines as these is likely to work without
tremendous friction.
* * * *
Probably, however, the most doubtful
point, and the largest mistake, and the
worst anomaly up to date, is the comprehen-
sive proviso that all powers not expressly
reserved to the Commonwealth Government
shall belong to the provincial authorities.
How much this means no one can tell
exactly until the Federal machine gets into
motion. Then it will probably be found
that the number of matters which no one
has remembered to make special provision
for is legion, and that the powers of the
Federal Government are so much more
limited than was generally supposed, that it
is an affair with very little authority of any
kind. Even the powers it does specifically
possess may prove useless in many cases for
want of control over some small detail or
insignificant-looking side issue needful for
the exercise of them. If the clause read in
the exactly opposite sense, and all powers
not specifically reserved to the Provincial
Governments belonged to the central autho-
rity, it would at least be much more work-
able. Then, if it was found that the Federal
Government had reserved to itself certain
powers which could be better exercised by
the local legislatures, a single enactment of
the Commonwealth Parliament could trans-
fer them ; if the same trouble arises under
the proposed order of things it will probably
be necessary to cajole six Legislatures, all of
which can never be found in the same mood
at the same time, to make the surrender.
Further, civilisation is always changing, and
new conditions are arising which have to be
dealt with, and new powers are required to
deal with them, and for the Central Govern-
ment to leave all the unknowable possibilities
of the future to a mere provincial authority
is doing a thing the meaning, or size, or
hazard of which no one can estimate.
Further, by always giving the benefit of the
doubt to the local Governments, it is assumed
that the prominent statesmen who find their
way into the Legislature of all Australia will
be necessarily less intelligent, and honest,
and patriotic than the small men who are left
behind in provincial politics ; and that the
parochial politician will necessarily take a
wider and clearer view than the national
one ; and that the country is more likely to
find about 800 upright men to form 12
Houses of Provincial Legislature than, say,
150 to form two Federal Houses. And all
these are very reckless assumptions indeed
The Policy of Shirk.
The Federal Convention discussion on the rail-
way gauge problem is, so far as it lias gone, a
fine example of the policy of hard, unflinching
shirk. There are three different gauges in this
country, and the change from 3ft. 6in. in Queens-
land to 4ft. in New South Wales, and
then to sft. 3in. in Victoria, and then to 3ft.
6in. again in South Australia, means much use-
less loading and unloading and re-loading of
passengers and cargo, much needless delay,
damage in handling goods, cost of handling
goods, many extra cars, trucks, and loco-
motives, and other varieties of waste and exas-
peration. In addition to all this, the break of
gauge would almost paralyse the military
department in case of invasion by making
impossible the rapid conveyance of troops and
material from one province to another, and it
would make it impracticable to shift rolling-
stock out of any particular province to prevent
it being seized and used or destroyed by an
enemy. The trouble is already very bad,
despite the fact that the New South Wales
and Queensland provincial systems only meet
at one point; likewise the New South Wales-
Victorian systems and those of Victoria and
South Australia have only one point of contact
apiece, while the system of the latter province
doesn’t, so far, meet that of Westralia at all,
nor is there any direct connection as yet between
South Australia and New South Wales or
Queensland. When the Victorian and New
South Wales lines meet in five or six or ten or
more places, and the Cobar and Bourke lines
connect with South Australia, and there are
a number of points of contact between New
South Wales and Queensland instead of only
one, the evil will be several dozen times worse
than it is, and the waste and circumlocution
several dozen times greater, and the exaspera-
tion will grow into an unknown quantity.
• * * *
All the provinces agree that there should be
only one gauge ; that there must, sooner or
later, be only one ; and that if the change isn’t
made at great expense now, it will have to be
made at much greater expense later on when
the systems have expanded. Also, it is unani-
mously agreed that the needless loss caused by
the present system is already very great when
the break of gauge makes trouble at three
places only, and that it will be immensely
greater when there are one or two or three
dozen separate breaks. And each province is
unanimously of opinion that the one way out of
the difficulty is for all the other provinces to
altet their lines to its gauge at their own ex-
pense. The unanimity on this point is simpiy
wonderful. 1 "
* * * *
The shortest and most obvious settlement of
the problem is to consolidate the railways and
the provincial debts under one management
Then there would be a central authority which
could decide on and establish a uniform gauge
and debit the cost of the alteration to Australia
in general, consequently the impossible asonv
of settling how much of the expense should
fairly be paid by each province would h F
averted. There would be no question of apnor
turning the cost among the provincial railway
departments or the provincial treasuries at all-
it would simply be charged to the Federation
at large. So far, however, the financial com-
mittee of the Convention has shirked the ques .
tion of Federal railway control because there
are “serious difficulties in the way,” and pro-
poses, as the next best resource, that a confer-
ence should be held to attempt some amicable
arrangement. Also, it is proposed by several
members that the matter should be hung up for
a while because the establishment of a uniform
gauge now would cost an appalling sum—
variously estimated at from £5,000,000 to
.£10,000,000, which probably the quaintest
piece of logic in this connection up to date.
Assuming the estimate to be correct, it natur-
ally follows that, if the matter is hung up long
enough, so that there will be more railway in
existence and more diverse gauge to alter,' the
cost of the work may easily be £15,000,000 to
£30,000,000 instead of the figure now quoted.
Also, it seems reasonably obvious that, if a
thing is very bad now' and is getting worse
every day, hanging it up will only make the
difficulty larger instead of smaller. But, so far
as financial problems are concerned, the Federal
committee is consistent to its policy of shirk
and postponement, and to very little else.
• * • *
As an amendment on the scheme for merely
talking over the matter, and the other scheme for
hanging it up, Premier Reid has suggested still
anothermethodof shirking the difficulty. Reid’s
idea is that the great main line which now runs
from Brisbane to Adelaide, and which will by-
and-bye go on to Perth, should be put on a
uniform gauge all through, and that branch
lines should remain as they are, and be allow’ed
to grow according to the present uncertain
method. If this idea is adopted some beauti-
fully interesting results will follow. The New
South Wales line to Cooma is a mere branch at
present; so is the Victorian line to Bairnsdale.
When they meet, however, they will be as dis-
tinctly a main line from Sydney to Melbourne
and a part of the great Brisbane-Adelaide sys-
tem as the track via Albury, and that new line
will have then to be put on the uniform gauge.
The only result of waiting until these two
branches become a main line will be that there
will then be 200 miles more track to re-lay,
and a corresponding increase of expense. When
the small gap from Deniliquin to Jerilderie is
covered, two more branch lines will become
a main railroad connecting Queensland and
South Australia and the intermediate provinces.
When the very small gap between Cobram and
Jerilderie is filled in, the Victorian branch via
Shepparton will likewise be a main interpro-
vincial line. The New South Wales line to
Cobar is only a branch now ; when it reaches
Broken Hill it w T ill probably be the main line
from Brisbane and Sydney to Adelaide and
Perth and the western provinces generally.
Also the idea of treating the South Australian
transcontinental line as a branch is absurd ; it
may be one at present, but when it is finished,
which must happen sooner or later, it will be
the main line, par excellence, of Australia. The
proposal to establish a uniform gauge for main
lines only looks good enough at the first glance;
the trouble is that there are about 3000 miles of
branch lines which will become main lines by-
and-bye, and will have to be treated as such.
And Premier Reid’s proposal simply means
postponing the necessary alteration of these
till they have expanded to 8000 or 10,000, and
the problem has become proportionately larger.
Also the Reid idea isn’t new ; in fact, it is the
same old shirk that has guided the policy of
this country from the beginning. The Victorian
railway-builders going north, and the New
South Wales engineers building towards the
south and the north, and the Queensland men
building southward, all decided for many years
that their varied gauges didn’t matter because
their isolated branches didn’t meet, and might
not meet for many years, and they all agreed
that when they did meet it would be time
enough to consider the difficulty. Now that
they do meet Premier Reid proposes spending
£2,000,000 or £3,000,000 in rectifying these
two particular blunders represented by the
breaks on the Victorian and Queensland borders.
Also, learning nothing by experience, he pro-
poses to go right on with eight or ten more
blunders of exactly the same character, with
exactly the same result ahead in each case.
* » * *
How very small the prospect is of settling
the difficulty by conference or treaty among the
various independent managements of the main-
land provinces can be measured by anyone who
considers the questions at issue. (Tasmania,
with an entirely isolated system, and Queens-
land, as a province standing, at present, out-
side the Federal movement, need not be con-
sidered just at present). Assuming that the
4ft. gauge of New South Wales—gener-
ally regarded as the most serviceable —is
adopted as the standard, Victoria must reduce
its lines from the present sft. 3in. measure-
ment ; South Australia will have to reduce the
width of some of its lines from sft. 3in. while
most of its railway system must be broadened
from the present 3ft. 6in. gauge; while the whole
Westralian system must be broadened from
3ft. 6in. to the regulation 4ft. BJin. Reducing
the width of railway lines costs very little; in-
creasing the gauge costs a great deal, as it in-
volves widening bridges, tunnels, viaducts,
embankments and cuttings, shifting back
fences, platforms and buildings, &c. The ex-
pense will have to be divided among the four
provinces equitably, as each is acting for the
common benefit, and the query arises—what is
an equitable division ? If the cost is allotted
according to population, New South Wales and
Victoria will pay about twice as much, in pro-
portion to the amount of railway they possess,
as the two other provinces. If the bill is
allotted according to the amount of line in
each province—if each province is called upon
to pay so much per mile of its own railway
system—South Australia will pay nearly three
times as much per inhabitant as New South
Wales and twice as much per inhabitant as
Victoria, and will probably be quite unable to
meet the bill. The liability can’t be allotted


according to area, for then South Australia and
Westralia, the two poorest and least populous
provinces, will pay practically all of it. And
each province can’t be called upon to pay its
own separate invoice, for then the one whose
gauge is adopted will contribute nothing at all.
• • * •
Further, if the 4ft. B|in. gauge is adopted,
Victoria makes a great saving on lines it may
construct in the future ; South Australia and
Westralia, on the other hand, make their future
lines much more costly, and will probably want
some consideration for the indefinite liability to
which they thus commit themselves. In the
provinces where the gauge is altered all the
rolling stock must also be altered or replaced.
This will likewise have to be allowed for, and
the amount of the allowance will depend to
some extent on the value—to be estimated as
impartially as possible—and age and dilapida-
tion of the stock sacrificed. The provinces
where a new gauge has to be introduced gain
some indirect benefit through the expenditure
of much money, partly contributed by their
neighbors, within their borders, and the conse-
quent furnishing of much employment to their
population, and a demand may possibly be
made that this should also be taken into
account. If Premier Reid’s proposal, to make
only the present interprovincial main line uni-
form, should be accepted, and the 4ft. B|in.
gauge is the one adopted, then in addition to
all the other troubles Victoria will doubtless
want some compensation for the extra expense
of working two gauges instead of one. And
when the bill, whatever it may be, is made up,
the insuperable problem is : How much of it
should be paid by a province with 2530 miles of
line and 1,277,000 people; and what is a fair
share for a province with 3103 miles of railway
and only 1,180,000 people ; and where does a
province with 360,000 people and 1722 miles of
line come in, and so on ?
* * • *
If the railways were consolidated into one
system under Federal management the whole
difficulty would disappear. It would then be
simply a case of deciding on a uniform Federal
gauge, making the necessary alterations, and
charging the cost to the system as a whole—
the impossible problems about how to divide
the bill fairly, and how to make sure of collect-
ing it when it is fairly divided, and about
which Treasurer will put up the money in the
first place and take his chance of never getting
the cheque from the Treasurer next door, would
all be eliminated. But the financial committee
of the Convention admits that it doesn’t feel
equal to the great problem of railway consoli-
dation ; and though it highly approves of a
uniform gauge, it doesn’t feel personally equal
to dealing with that either. In fact, it seems
not quite equal to anything save the great art
of Shirk.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Compromise.
The brightest thing that the Convention’s
financial committee has done so far, is the com-
promise it has effected on the surplus question.
It is, on the whole, probably as good a com-
promise as circumstances—a very bad set of
circumstances—would allow. For the first
year or two years, until the Federal tariff is
agreed upon, the present provincial tariffs are
to remain in force. The Federal Government
will collect the money, debit each province
with its share of the Federal expenditure ac-
cording to population, and return the balance
to the provincial Treasurers. When the
Federal tariff gets into operation the same
book-keeping system is to be followed for five
years ; each province is to be credited with the
revenue which it yields to the Central Govern-
ment, and charged with its share of the Federal
expenditure, and is to get back the balance,
but it is stipulated that the said balance
must be at least as large as it was during the
last year before the uniform tariff came in force.
After five years, when the provinces have got
their second wind, and the Federal and Pro-
vincial Governments have begun to understand
where they are, and the worst of the confusion
and shindy is over, the elaborate book-keeping
system is to be abandoned, and the surplus dis-
tributed according to the population of each
province. This arrangement, if it isn’t overset
later on, is at least a decent way of striking an
average among a lot of difficulties. The first and
best idea was that the provinces should handover
their customs and excise revenues, and that the
Federal Government should pay the interest on
the public debts, and then things would be
about even, and there would be no surplus to
worry about. This fell through, no one knows
exactly how. Then the Freetrade party at-
tempted a weird scheme whereby the provinces
gave up their customs and excise revenues
(about <£9,000,000) ; the Federal Government
paid its own expenses (about £2,000,000) out of
them, and then abolished the rest as a matter
of necessity because it wouldn’t be allowed
to hand the difference back, or pay the inter-
est or the principal of the public debt with it,
or build railways with it; and thus a beautiful
era of almost absolute Freetrade would come
about by compulsion. Meanwhile the pro-
vinces, having still the interest on their debts
to pay, and having surrendered the right to
levy Customs and excise and thus lost the re-
venue out of which the interest has hitherto been
paid, would mostly have to go broke for the
sake of Foreign-trade, the gap in the finances
being too large to be filled by direct taxation.
The compromise proposed means that the policy
of going broke in the name of Foreign-trade is
postponed for five years. During that period
it is estimated that the Federal Government
will have to raise enough revenue to pay
its own expenses and also to divide ,£6,000,000
a year among the provinces. It can raise
the required amount by a protective tariff,
or a revenue tariff, or partly by a tariff
and partly by direct taxation, or wholly by
direct taxation, as it pleases, so every party
and policy and fad gets an equal show. At the
end of the five years its obligation to subsidise
the States apparently ceases, and by that time
it will probably, if it is a reasonably sane
Government, have come to some definite deei-
sion about what to do next. Unless the Con-
vention upsets the whole arrangement the
great financial difficulty seems to be shunted
well forward into next century, and a lot of
people will be dead or disappeared or in gaol
before then, and a lot of new people will have
to tackle the problem.
The Sacredness of Property.
Michael O’Connor, a recently-deceased Vic-
torian who is alleged to have been eccentric in
his lifetime and a martyr to indigestion, fur-
nishes a convenient peg whereon to hang a wail
about the stupidity of Australian law. Michael
died leaving over .£5OO worth of property
behind him, all of which he carefully be-
queathed to two neighbors, leaving Mrs.
Bridget O’Connor penniless. No reason, ex-
cept misanthropy arising from aggravated in-
digestion, was shown for this action, but as it
was impossible to prove absolute insanity on
the part of the deceased, or undue influence on
the part of the legatees, the Supreme Court
decided that the will must hold good. As
Judge a’Beckett put the matter :
A man has a right to dispose of his property in what-
ever manner he pleases. Although he has a faithful wife
and dutiful children he has a right, if he pleases, to leave
his property to others.
The Bulletin urges that the above right
should be promptly thunder-blasted by Act of
Parliament, for various reasons. One is that in
most cases a man’s property is not his own by
moral right, whatever it may be legally.
Michael O’Connor, corporation laborer by
profession, couldn’t accumulate .£5OO at his
precarious occupation save by denying himself
and Bridget, his wife, many luxuries and en-
joyments, therefore, in a moral sense, it was as
much her money, accumulated by her self-
denial, as his. And this rule holds good
in probably the majority of cases. But,
even assuming that the family pile is
solely a husband’s own accumulation, and that
his wife is not only useless in a financial sense,
but is also a thoroughly objectionable character
who deserves to be disinherited, the law which
permits such a thing is questionable policy. If
the deceased husband doesn’t support her, then
the community in many cases must, and the
deceased has at least as good a right to support
his own objectionable Bridget as a perfect
stranger or a number of perfect strangers have.
The system by which, when a woman is too
bad to have a claim on her deceased husband,
she thereby establishes a claim on other people,
is a pleasant consideration—for the other people.
Moreover, the law is a self-contradictory ass.
It doesn’t allow a husband, under any circum-
stances, to leave his wife without support while
he is alive, however bad the lady may be —the
only way he can get out of the liability is
by divorce, whereupon she ceases to be
his wife; and it seems ludicrous to allow
a corpse, which doesn’t amount to much
at the best, privileges which are refused
to the living individual. The mere beastly
sacredness of property doesn’t account for the
law’s present attitude ; if property is so dis-
gustingly holy that the statutes can’t prevent a
man of means leaving his wife penniless after
his death, then they have no right to so far
dictate to him what he shall do with his
own worldly goods as to prevent him leav-
ing her penniless while he is alive. Either
it is absolutely wrong for the law to interfere
in the latter case, or it is absolutely wrong for
it not to interfere in the former. The only
moral injury that would be done to the de-
ceased by a reversal of the present law, would
be that the old man would be deprived of the
pleasure of thinking, in his last moments, how
surprised the old woman would be when she
had to take in Washing for a livelihood later on,
and there is no absolute reason why the law
should encourage this frame of mind in any
dying citizen. ' On the whole, The Bulletin
holds a brief for widow Bridget all the time.
Some Advice to Young Men.
“ Melbourneite ” to The Bulletin :
Mr. Justice Hood (Yic.) the other day publicly gave what
has been described as some “ advice to young men.” The
occasion was an application by the trustees of a fund of
£5OO to be allowed to apply £2OO of the amount to the
medical education of the beneficiary. The alleged advice
consisted in making some references to the folly of young
men without considerable means going in for the learned
professions, and, in refusing the application with the
luminous remark that if it were granted “ the applicant
would then have i 300 while he starved at a profession,
instead of becoming an honest tradesman.” The practi-
cal value of his Honor’s advice would have been greatly
increased had he indicated the particular trade which he
thought it advisable for that young man to follow. Doubt-
less the number of young fellows going in for law and
medicine is calculated to make one wonder how they
are all going to make a living; but the mistake the Judge
makes is in concentrating the judicial spectacles upon
one small aspect of a very large question. His Honor, no
doubt, observes that, mainly owing to the intrusion of
“ young men without considerable means,” law and medi-
cine are not the pleasant monopolies they used to be, and
therefore he insists that this particular youth shall turn
his hand to something else. But what his Honor does
not appear to have taken judicial cognisance of is the
fact that the honest tradesman runs some risk of starving
too, as well as the honest (or otherwise) lawyer or doctor,
and that on the whole it is, perhaps, less unpleasant to
be a starving medico than, say, a starving bricklayer or
blacksmith. His Honor’s attention might have been
drawn to the fact that in this young and progressive
country most other trades seem to be suffering from the
same painful superfluity of practitioners. Forinstance, the
possibilities of the small-grocery business seem to have been
pretty fully explored, and there does not appear to be any
great dearth of bakers, butchers, shoemakers, or milk-
men. Even in the undertaking business, although the
total turnover does not show any marked diminution,
competition has so cut into the profits that some honest
tradesmen have had to combine the legitimate trade with
the allied occupation of reading burial services. Also,
Horace Greeley’s advice, “Go West, young man,”
appears to have found sufficient followers for the present,
and the number of people who are “ settled on the land ”
—and can’t see any chance to get off it—appears to be as
great as the exigencies of the case require. And, after all,
there are a few prizes in the so-called learned professions
which don’t come in the way of the honest tradesman.
For example, it is hard at the moment to recall any
instance in which a tradesman, however honest, was able
(like his Honor) before the age of 40 to collar a £3OOO a
year billet with a huge pension attached. On the other
hand, it is easy to remember many instances of men who
probably did not have a clear £3OO to start with who can
earn more money in 12 months than any honest tradesman
would earn in 12 years. Perhaps, on further considera-
tion, his Honor will see his way to let this youth take his
chance and hustle with the rest, and will leave him and
his mother to settle the question of a profession between
them.
Yet another miscarriage of justice through a
jury fearing to leave the sentencing of an
accused to the mercies of the presiding Judge.
In a conspiracy case at At bury, N.S. W.,in which
a man and woman were arraigned, the jury-
men, having been locked up all night, announced
that they were unable to agree unless his Honor
could assure them that if a verdict of guilty
were brought in the female accused would be
dealt with under the First Offenders Act. His
Honor declined to entertain the proposition,
and the twelve then announced that they could
arrive at no verdict, and were discharged.
Juries, if competent to find a man guilty,
should be equally competent to say how guilty
they think him by fixing the punishment with-
in statutory limits. The Executive could
always revise the sentence of a jury just as it
now does that of a Judge. When is this much-
needed reform coming along ?

They are representatives of the Boers (such a
miserable few), while the Uitlanders (t’other-
siders) of course are voiceless. And it is they
who decide when the interests of Vic.-N.S.W.
clash with those of S.A.-Tas., and it is quite on
the cards that the result will be a pickle that
Vic. -N.S. W. cannot swallow. Andisn’tit likely,
when the Boers hold the balance of power ?
In that case, shall Federation be abandoned ?
There is no need for it at all. Vic. and N.S. W.
will benefit most by Federation, anyhow, and
it sticks out a mile that Vic. and N.S.W. will
see the advisability of a partnership that leaves
out the three trivial provinces. Then, if Tas.,
or S.A., or W.A. wants to come in, it will have
to be on Vic.-N.S.W. terms —or not at
all. And the Q. slave-trade ?
—Fluffy.
Premier Forrest, of Boomland, has organised
in the Convention a temporary league of the
three un-populous provinces—Westralia, S.A.,
and Tasmania—against Victoria and N.S.
Wales, and is t unning a hurried, kaleidoscopic
little shindy of his own re the powers of the
Federal Upper House in money matters. As a
large, robust cormorant, there are some pro-
minent points about Forrest. It has been
agreed that in the popular chamber each pro-
vince shall have one member for each 50,000
inhabitants, but not less than five members
in all—this latter being a special conces-
sion to the smaller states; while in the
Upper House each state shall have six
members regardless of population. There-
fore, N.S.W. and Victoria, with 2,480,000
people, will have 12 senators and 49 representa-
tives between them ; while Westralia, S.A. and
Tasmania, with about 640,000 inhabitants, will
have 18 senators and 17 representatives. This
is tolerably liberal, but in addition Forrest
demands that the Senate shall have exactly the
same power in money matters as the Lower
House, and as the small provinces will dominate
the Senate and the large ones the other Cham-
ber this means that the power shall be equally
divided between them—that the 640,000 people
who pay one-fifth of the taxes shall have
as much control over them as the 2,480,000
who pay the other four - fifths. The re-
sult, in all probability, wouldn’t pan out in
anything like the way Forrest anticipates, but
that doesn’t make his demand any the less
ridiculous. For the moment, the three less
populous provinces are acting together, and
Forrest assumes that they will keep on acting
together always, which is wholly improbable.
Tasmania, to all intents and purposes, is a
satellite of Victoria, and it has very little in
common with Westralia, except the desire for
more than its fair share of power, and, if the
Federal Parliament is formed as Forrest
desires, Tasmania, N.S.W., and Victoria will
probably run together in most matters, and
then Forrest will wish he had never got all
these extra votes for the little isle. Also, there
are many other possibilities to be considered.
In their own stupid, short-sighted fashion,
however, Forrest and his followers are fine
samples of the cormorant tribe, and the warn-
ing issued by some of the N.S.W. and Vic.
delegates, that they would rather throw Wes-
tralia out of the Commonwealth bodily than
give way any further, is fully justified.
♦
“ Swamper” to The Bulletin :
Part of the theory of English law is that the Sovereign
can do no wrong, and, therefore, cannot be sued by a
subject. But the Government, which is the Sovereign,
often does do wrong, and, to get over the difficulty, the
subject presents a “ petition of right,” which is endorsed
by the Sovereign “ Let right be done in this matter ” in
such-and-such a court. Royalty having thus graciously
condescended, the matter becomes determinable in court.
In theory, everyone has the liberty to present a petition
of right and to know the formal decision of the Sovereign
in the matter. But in the absolute monarchy of Wes-
tralia King Forrest has gone one better than Queen Vic-
toria. When a petition of right presented by a Wes-
tralian citizen is returned to the Governor of that pro-
vince endorsed “ Let right be done in this matter
in the Supreme Court of Westralia” to be handed to
the petitioner, it is first enquired into by the
Forrest Ministry, and if thought fit the Governor
is constitutionally advised not to hand it to the peti-
tioner or allow it to he filed for decision in the
Supreme Court. The Governor is bound to accept this
advice, and the result is that the particular case never
gets to the Supreme Court. In the first case of this kind
a petition of right presented by the Westralian Land
Co. was endorsed, and the representative of the co. in
London informed of the endorsement, but the Westralian
Govt, would not give up the petition nevertheless. The
cause of action was that the Govt., to prevent the co. from
selecting under its land-grant concession the unsold lots in
the towns along the Great Southern railway, declared (ille-
gally, the co. contends) such lots Govt, reserves as “ resting-
places for travellers and stock.” The local representative
of the company, who is also an Opposition politician, has
been unavailingly endeavoring to induce the Govt, to
publish the endorsement, as a matter of right. A second
case is that in which a Westralian resident desires to sue
the Govt, for damages in a claim based on “ perversely
stupid and long-continued maladministration of the
Lands Department.” He was informed by the Governor
that his petition of right had been returned from Eng-
land endorsed with the usual formula, but the Govt,
blocked the “ official return ” of the petition to the
Supreme Court, and that tribunal cannot therefore try
the matter. The Govt, states that it is unable to
forward the petition as “ communications are still
pending between the Govt, and the Secretary of
State for the Colonies in regard to the question.”
The petitioner replies that no communication should
be requisite in respect of a petition of right.
Here is an argument, if any were needed, for Australian
legal procedure to be freed from the fooleries consequent
on the idea that it is infra dig. for the “ Crown,” which
embraces every wretched Govt, department, to be sued
unless the suitor first prays for a petition and the petition
is graciously granted. Govt, departments should be
amenable for their omissions and commissions in the same
way as any other public institution, without the necessity
of an appeal to England. It aggravates the abuse that after
the roundabout process of petition to the English Govt,
permission to sue should be suppressed by an autocratic
provincial Govt., against which there is no possibility
of appeal—in the case of the Westralian Govt, not even to
public opinion. Premier Forrrst hawked the question
to the last gathering of the Federal Council with the
object of soliciting the support of the other Australian
Govts, for his attitude towards petitions of right. The
fact has not been officially disclosed, neither has been the
result of Premier Forrest’s representations to his fellow
Premiers, which are said not to have been satisfactory
from his point of view.
Australian officialdom might bake a hint from
the Prince of Wales’s recent epistle to the
Londoners re commemorating his mother’s good
luck in reigning so long. Barring an allusion
to “ the sentiment of gratitude for the blessings
which the country has enjoyed during the last
sixty years,” Wales (or his private secretary)
doesn’t utter a line of nonsense, and even that
can’t be called “ loyal ” nonsense. The words
“throne,” “gracious,” “Her Majesty” and
“blessing of Providence” are conspicuously
absent from the Heir-Apparent’s yarn, which
stamps that plump and elderly personage as a
much cuter man than his grovelsome adorers
suppose him to be. Force of circumstances has
made Albert Edward the most genuinely loyal
subject in Great Britain, but in setting up the
“ Diamond Jubilee ” as a particular excuse for
raising a big charity fund, he doesn’t place his
mother in front of the more deserving object,
or beside it, or anywhere in the object’s vici-
nity. Also, he cheerfully admits that the earth
belongs to One Above, by mentioning ground-
landlords as the first people who should express
their sentiment of gratitude in hard cash. The
“ Wales” epistle may be read by any respect-
able democrat without a blush. Can one say
as much for the jubilee manifestoes of Her
Gracious Majesty’s leading loyal subjects at
this end of the Hempire ?
+
J.D. : —The greasy contributors to the Fat Man
papers excel in saying small and spiteful things
in the most bilious way. For instance, Sed-
don’s proposed inscription of “he loved the
people ” on the Ballance monument is des-
cribed by an Australasian scribe as “hate-
ful ” ; and Mrs. Seddon’s action in planting a
wreath on the grave of Hori Grey’s infant,
buried fifty years ago in South Australia, is
written up as being in the worst possible taste.
The crowd that goes madder than usual and
weeps maudlin tears of joy while howling the
National Anathema, is fearfully jealous when
“ common people ” tap the artesian stream of
sentimentality. How they squealed when Sed-
don took off his coat to helu at the Brunner
mine disaster ! Yet how noble it was, accord-
ing to those same papers, when that trans-
parent self-advertiser, Baron Carington, sent
round his vice-regal carriage to cart a bashed
footballer off the field of gore !
Apropos Mr. John Morley’s recent remarks in
the House of Commons : —The native problem
in the Nor’west (W.A.) should soon disappear,
owing to the nig. supply running short. A few
months ago two natives, after the attempted
murder of a white man, joined their own tribe.
Result: Police declared war against the tribe,
killed six at the first encounter, and, following
them up, three more three days afterwards.
The two men who were wanted, as usual,
escaped, but the police found that those killed
were all “ noted murderers and cattle-stealers,”
besides having “associated” with the two
delinquents. Another murder occurred on the
Fitzroy River recently ; result, two nigs, killed
and several (number unknown) wounded—no
policemen hurt. Black troopers “ obeyed in-
structions admirably.” Again the murderers
escaped. It is unhealthy to be a nig. in the
north if there has been any spearing done
recently. Pathetic telegrams from the scene of
the outbreak appear in the Perth papers,
expressing the hope that the police authorities
in Perth would not interfere before the nigger-
drive was brought off. The authorities did not
interfere, and the next telegram was to the
effect that “arrangements had been made for
finally dispersing the gang if the Perth authori-
ties concur.” The Perth authorities concurred.
The Cold-Tea brigade already raises its voice
to demand that the power shall be reserved to
the separate States of the Federation that
hasn’t yet arrived, to abolish Der-rink, each
within its own borders. Apparently under the
draft constitution they have got the power ; it
is provided that all powers not expressly
reserved to the Federal Government shall
remain with the States, and there is no men-
tion of whisky in the Constitution. This item
should lead to some first-class riot by-and-bye.
The present idea is that, after a certain period,
the Federal Government shall simply lumD
together the customs and excise revenue in one
fund, and divide the surplus, if any, among the
States according to population. Whatever else
happens, it may be safely assumed that the
liquor duties will still remain, and pro-
bably at about the same rate as at pre-
sent. Therefore, if, say, N.S.W. shut down
on alcohol in all forms, and prohibited its
manufacture, sale or importation, it would
deprive the Federal Government of about
£900,000 a year revenue, and thus make the
Federal Treasurer sit up quite suddenly. Then
the other provinces, which were still given to
drink, would have to pay a great part of
N.S.W.’s share of the Federal expenses as
well as their own ; and if the surplus was
divided on a population basis, N.S.W. might
actually get more money handed back to it
than it contributed. It looks as if it would be
necessary to make some special provision to
prevent any long-haired fanatics fooling with
the Federal revenue in the name of the Lord.


A forceful letter from Mr. James Ashton,,
M. L. A., “ Map Di vi sions versus Men, ” dealing with
the subject of representation in the Federal
Senate, will appear in next issue of The Bulletin.
Dan. O’Connor’s recent after-dinner dia-
tribe against the N.S.W. Public Service Commis-
sion much amuses those who happen to know
that one of the O’Connor clan has just been made
to sit up by the Board for neglecting his official
duties, and that this is not the first occasion on
which the hated triumvirate has had to haul one
of the said clan over the coals.
There are shows and shows. The Agricul-
tural Society’s aims to be good ; sundry shows are
occasionally better; but A. Saunders’s show of
watches, jewelry, and silver-plate at George-street,
Sydney, near the railway station, is always em-
phatically the best. A. Saunders stocks every-
thing that is good and fashionable ; and his prices
are the lowest in Sydney for the quality.*
The Corbett - Fitzsimmons battle will

It was cabled that the great fight was recorded
all through by the Kinetoscope, and the colonial
branch of the Edison Laboratory before the fight
took place made its arrangements for securing the
record. The Edison Vitascope, Kinetoscope, and
Kinetophone, and the wonderful X-rays are still
on show in the Parlor, and are attracting great
public interest.*

The great desolation which surrounds the
Good Friday season and heralds the hot-cross
bun is upon the Sydney theatres. The Royal re-
mains closed; Her Majesty’s and the Palace are
shut up till Saturday ; the Lyceum is still de-
serted ; the Opera House is deserted practically
all the time, and has no occupant except the ghost
of many previous ghosts that failed to walk ; the
Gaiety and Royal Standard are abandoned, as
usual ; and except for the Tivoli and Criterion,
which still keep to the fore, the cold blast of
shutting-up has swept over every house in Sydney.
Altogether it is about the roost beautifully unani-
mous closing on record.
** * *
Her Majesty’s re-opens on Saturday, with
the “Prisoner of Zenda,’’ when Williamson’s
recently-imported co. will lay before a presumably
large and fas ionable audience the troubles of the
red-headed King of Ruritania. The closing nights
of “ Matsa ” were ornamented by a prosperous
farewell matinee to Miss Florence Young and by
an indignant speech from Mr. Knowles, who took
a pathetic leave of the audience and made sundry
unfeeling observations about this paper. As far
as could be gathered, Mr. Knowles is not going to
become a regular subscriber to The Bulletin for
the rest of his life, and its red cover won’t be found
blowing about his backyard if he can help it, and
the Knowles infant, if there is one, will not be
allowed to amuse itself with “ Hop’s ” cartoons
unless it subscribes surreptitiously on its own
account when its father is away at the theatre in a
hurry as usual. It was the first time a Sydney
audience saw the recent funny man in an in-
tentionally serious mood, and his attitude was
impressive, not to say homicidal.
** * *
That heavenly fiddler, Ovide Musin, backed
up by Madame Musin, Misses Eva Mylott, and
Constance Hatherley, Mr. Burns-Walker—
whose singing “ mak.es the girls cry ” and
others, gives a Good Friday night concert at Syd-
ney Town Hall. On Saturday the same seraphic
combination starts a concert season at the Palace.
** * #
The same night the adventurous William
Cosgrove the man who waged the historic
war with Westmacott for possession of Her
Majesty’s and carried out the opposition firm and
laid it gently on the pavement—re-opens his tem-
pestuous career at the Lyceum with a comedy-
drama called “ Squattocracy.” His advt. an-
nounces the “ special engagement of Miss Myra
Kemble after her wonderful recovery from an
almost fatal illness.” Sydney had practically lost
sight of this favorite of brighter and more pro-
sperous days—the days when the Harbor City was
a gay and frivolous place with vine-leaves in its
hair, and when sand-shifting wasn’t the prevailing
industry—but it should roll up in a stupendous
mass to congratulate her on her recovery, and give
her its unanimous assurance that she still lives in
the great horsey soul of the community,
** * *
That pretty comedy - drama, “Sweet
Lavender,” will fill in this week at Sydney Cri-
terion. A revival of “Charley’s Aunt” follows
on Saturday, when the respectable elderly relative
from Brazil, where the hard and exasperating
vegetable comes from, should have an excellent
reception. The Tivoli has added the silvery-
voiced Phil Newbery to an already strong com-
pany, and all lovers of excellent music are hereby
cordially invited to go and listen to that stout
phenomenon. And there is practically nothing
else to report, save that Jimmy M‘Mahon’s cine-
matographe goeth on for ever; and the vitascope,
where the Corbett-fight machine is, hangs out at
the old address. An indefinable air of expect-
ancy, born of waiting till the dyspeptic bun has
blown over, pervades even the smaller shows this
week, and the same’* feeling enshrouds these few
paragraphs. The prevailing sentiment is that
nothing in particular is worth doing till the soul-
ful Friday victual rolls by. Next week’s issue
will duly chronicle the outburst of glory which
follows when the publio has got that provender off
its mind.
»* * *
Some rather complimentary remarks upon
“ A Woman’s Revenge,” at Melb. Royal, should
have appeared in last issue of this family journal,
but didn’t, owing, perhaps, to the Melbourne
Postal Department’s slow recovery from a recent
annual picnic. The remarks in question are there-
fore lost to literature. “A Woman’s Revenge”
will be numbered among the Bland Holtian by-
gones after to-night (Thursday), and the theatre
will close for the next night only, by Act of Par-
liament, leaving the management at liberty to
engage in a solemn Easter bun-struggle. The
new show for Saturday is “In Sight of St.
Paul’s,” a drama that includes the most glaring
fire-scene on record, and is in other respects calcu-
lated to make an audience turn pale.
«* * *
Talking of pallid audiences—at the Dra-
matic Fund Benefit, a fortnight ago, there was a
scare. Not a serious scare, fortunately, but just
sufficient of an alarm to excite the self-preservation
instinct in several loving husbands, who were
about to leave Anna Maria to her doom, when the
voices of a large majority forced them to sit down
again. Under such conditions, the resumption of
one’s place beside the woman one intended to flee
from is a very painful ordeal.
** * *
Mrs. Potter and Bellew are returning to
the Princess’s on Saturday for a three-weeks’
season. The first revival of those picturesque
artists will happen in “Romeo and Juliet,” a
substantial co. having been engaged to assist their
interpretation of the Immortal Bard. Kyrle
Bellew, it seems, has “thoroughly thought out ”
the question as to whether Juliet’s marriage, was
a failure, and the Firm expects gratifying results
from his cogitation.
#* * *
The Bijou, closed since the Broughs tore
themselves away, re-opens on Saturday with
Henry Bracy in the chair. In Melbourne the
time is nearly always ripe for comic opera, and
just at present “ The Beggar Student ” sounds
promising. Also, the prices are popular, and the
leading ladies have the charm of newness, conse-
quently Bracy is entitled to expect a fair run for
his money.
** * *
At Rickards’s Opera House a neatly-
balanced programme is filling the premises, as
usual, and if the management ventures to attempt
special attractions for Easter The Bulletin will
not be answerable for the decease of anyone who
gets fatally squeezed in the doorway. The Phil-
harmonic Society breaks out again at Melbourne
Town Hall, on Good Friday, with “ Elijah,” sup-
ported by the presence of Brassey, K.C.B. At
the Exhibition Building an excited state of affairs
will prevail for some days to come. On Friday a
concert, on Saturday the great Eight Hours
corroboree, and on Monday and during the rest of
next week, a Druids’ Gala on a stupendous scale.
Art-Union prizes, phenomenal wheel-races, un-
rivalled baby-contests, and other festivities
arranged in honor of the Eight Hours movement
and the Ancient Druids are too numerous to men-
tion. The price of a ticket for either show is a
nimble shilling to whieh remote possibilities are
attached.

Two nights last week a ghastly caricature
of “ Rob Roy ” was perpetrated at Melbourne
Alexandra by the local Caledonian Society. In
some way or other the local Thistle Club was con-
cerned in this hideous event, but whether the
Thistles acted for the benefit of the Caledonians,
or the Caledonians made objects of themselves
whilst the Thistles cheered them on, the present
writer is unable to say. In either case both par-
ties deserve unqualified condemnation, inas-
much as the doers of the deed were
no worse than the loyal Scots who en-
couraged them to do it again. Democrats at a
distance may argue that applause bestowed on
Jock M‘lntyre, M.L.A., would be excusable if it
induced him to abandon politics for the stage.
The writer held the same opinion until he actually
saw M‘lntyre as Nicol Jarvie, since when he feels
certain that the veteran legislator had better be
left in charge of the Conservative party.
• • • •
“ Rob Roy ” was a public entertainment,
open to Irishmen, Englishmen, and every
other kind of foreigner who could be
bounced into paying for admission. A
Scotch in a kilt displayed himself out-
side the theatre as a pictorial advt., with the
result that a few members of the general
public dropped their money down the sink of his-
trionio iniquity. Concerning Miss Eloise Juno
and a couple of nice-looking lady amateurs, the
Voice of Truth will remain silent, but, as regards
MTntyre and his male colleagues, the Voice takes
this chance to let off a derisive yell.
At Poverty Point.
Kate Vaughan, who lately visited Australia, and was
understood to be dying of Bright’s disease, has been
divorced by her husband, Col. Wellesley, for adultery
with an actor. Miss Vaughan, it will 'be remembered,
was married by Col. Wellesley, erstwhile a member of
the Prince of YVales’ special set, after he had been divorced
by his wife, a daughter of N.S.W. former-Governor Lord
Augustus Loftus.
From S.M. Herald, Monday, April 12, ’97 :—“ Miss
Wray, who has a great deal of comic talent, has done
some brilliant work during her short career, which in
Sydney dates only from her appearance as Clairette, in
‘ Madame Angot,’ on 25th Sept., 1895. Her retirement is
due to her approaching marriage with a leading medical
practitioner at Auckland.” It may interest the public
to know that the lady was married to Dr. Sharman by
the N.S.W. Registrar-General last month. The regis-
ter sets forth that the bride was Juliette Gertrude
Flegeltaub, of Ballarat, aged 21, and that the other party
to the proceedings was Edward William Sharman,
Juliette’s senior by ten years. The deed was perpetrated
on March 15, so that the honeymoon is over, and Juliette
is a well-established married woman.
The Bulletin’s announcement of Olga Nethersole’s
marriage is probably premature. The event was arranged
to happen last month, but letters recently to hand from
’Murka state that Miss N. and her husband-elect have put
off the evil day until September.
At a musical matinee given in honor of Massenet at the
Ecole Marchesi, the most prominently-placed artiste was
Cicely Staunton (Goldenstedt), of Sydney, who sang an
Ave Maria and other items. Miss Staunton got some of
her Australasian musical training in her native Maori-
land, and subsequently gained much benefit from the
tuition of Annis Montague, of whose company she was
for some time a member.
The rivalry between Melba and Nordica daily grows
more pronounced, especially over the rendering of Wag-
nerian roles. Melba, writing to a N.Y. journal, states
that she does not intend representing Brunhilde for
years to come for fear of injuring her voice. Nordica,
who subsequently appeared as Brunhilde, wrote to the
same journal as a parting dig: “ Wagner’s music never
injured anyone who could sing it, and who knew how.”
Artist Harry Furniss comes to Australia, as Mark Twain
came, to build up broken fortunes. He has never pro-
spered since he left London Punch, and his paper, Lika
Joko, merged in the New Budget, died without many
public tears. Furniss, as a black-and-white artist, does
not seem to have done much that is notable outside his
field as a Parliamentary cartoonist, and ranks to-day
rather among the bygones.
During the Potter-Bellew Melb. season a little play,
written by a smart Australian youth, is to have a hearing.
“ A Studio Episode,” by Arnold Denham, is to be given
as a curtain-raiser to “ Forget-me-not.”
Melb. : “ Sims makes a bad shot, in his last ‘ Mustard
and Cress,’ of London Referee. He ingeniously pieces it
up that Gabriel, the nigger turned white, shown lately in
Mein., is one born white, who appeared in London.
Gabriel's change is certified to by the Adelaide Hospital
authorities.”
The Bulletin hears, on good authority, that Miss Bessie
Rignold’s much-criticised red wig in “ Lavender ” was not
her own idea, b'ut was forced on her by a color-
blind management with a yearning for weird, tomatO-
hued effects. Considering that the character was very
good on the whole, and that the w r ig was very awful, this
paper is of opinion that the management should allow
Miss Bessie to select her own hair in future. If she
selects it as well as she does the rest of her adorable self
she will make a much better success than the person who
chose the present lurid top-hamper did. Besides, if a
lady can’t select her own hair, where has the liberty of
the subject gone to ?
Marion Terry’s claim for damages against the newspaper
which “ engaged” her to a brother-in-law- was presumably
based on the fact that she is already married to another
fellow.
Melb. demise : Allan, of the Collins-street music ware*
house. A singularly amiable, graceful man.
Melb. : “ The proverbial coolness of our audiences was
not evinced in the fire scare at the Princess matinee.
This house is on a corner, as every theatre should be, with
no vestibule, bars, or other impedimenta, between the
audience and the streets. The Bijou, all upstairs, is com-
paratively a trap, the Opera House a tinder-box.
Melb. : “ ‘ Romeo and Juliet’ has not often been acted
in this city. Brook only took Mercutio. So did Barry
Sullivan. Curious that no adequate Romeo was ever seen
here till Bellew s first visit. Mrs. Scott-Siddons has been
our best Juliet, with Dampier snorting Romeo. The
Mighty Atom fetched to Australia the scenery of Irving’s
London production, with Miss Reid as Juliet! while Cates
got about his last chance as Romeo.”
Rossi was a splendid Romeo up to sixty, but Bellew
doesn’t age—any more.
The Bach Passion Music, Melb. Anglican Cathedral,
half-a-crown a noli, was announced as a “ service.” Con-
sequently, Toorakia attended in evening-dress, as a com-
pliment to the Almighty.
Musgrove has secured the rights of the enormously-suc-
cessful comic-opera “ La Poupie,” by Audran.
Apropos Ada Ward. A clergyman brought under
Irving’s notice the fact that Sheridan Knowles abandoned
the stage for the pulpit. Irving : “ But he went on tak-
ing the royalties for his plays.”
Sam Moyle, whose rugged baritone did useful service,
of yore, at Holy Trinity Church, Melbourne, is now choir-
master at the Church of Reconciliation, New York.
Gladstone Wright, back in Melbourne, resumes his old
place among the £lOO a-year members of St. Paul’s Cathed-
ral choir, and will stay for twelve months, anyway. Al-
ways an artistic singer, Wright has benefited, vocally, by
his trip to England, where he will in due course settle
down for good if he can’t see a certainty of doing better
on this side. At present Australia is about the coldest
country on earth for concert-singers.
Miss Eileen O’Moore, known to Australians as Bessie
Doyle, is professionally prospering in London, and lives
in great style—lovely gowns, plenty of diamonds, and a
well-appointed carriage.
For “ La Poup6e,” which is doing wonderful biz. at the
Prince of Wales’s, writes a Bulletin correspondent from
London, Billy Walshe shaved his beautiful moustache,
and in the new guise is singularly like Greenaway.
Walshe manages to run in a few odd engagements
between the waits in “ La Poup6e.’.
Melba, at latest, was ill in Paris, and makes a very bad
patient. Her enforced retirement from her American
season is very galling, for she is quite the idol of the
States. Besides, there is a guarantee of £40,000 hanging
on to her Brazilian tour.
When Will R. Barnes, of New York, gets there, he is
bound to run up against his one-time deadly rival for the
smile of a certain actress—the bewtchus “Bob” Burt,
one time Age dramatic critic, and now trying his luck in
America. Barnes and Burt both used to turn up nightly
at the Princess with floral sprays for the willowy one
and, after delivering them solemnly at the dressing-room
of the diva, would scowl at one another “ in front ” while
they waited to see whose’favor would be worn. Madame
was wily, and regularly wore the offering of each lovelorn
loon in alternate acts.
They are telling- a story of the scare at the Melbourne
Princess’s down Yarrawards. Immediately after the out-
break of the alarm, a portly citizen, crimson, breathless
and tattered as if he had just been tossed by ten cows’
landed with a bound in front of the stalls pay-box, howl!
ing : “ Theatre’s a-fire ! gimme me money back !’* ’
Mrs. Molyneux, the handsome and clever actress, well-
remembered in Sydney, is now in the English provinces"
playing the leading character in “ Under the Red Robe '
English press notices to hand are mostly jam and
enthusiasm.
Colborne Baber—under the name of “ Lilia Harrison "
—made her London ddbut at the Queen's Hall sacred
concert on Asn Wednesday, and created quite a favorable
impression. “ Among the more attractive features of the
concert,” said London D.T., “was the earnest and un-
affected rendering of the solo in ‘Hear My Prayer’ bv
Madame Lilia Harrison, an Australian soprano, w ho made
a promising dbbut.”
Cooper, J. (Brisbane'), commenting on bankruptcy
counsel’s charge that a bankrupt pro. had borrowed £4O
from Tom Finney under false pretences: “He seems to
be able to strike some very good-natured people.
This transaction will probably save Mr. Finney a good
many times £4O in the future.” His Honor declined to
“ commit.” In short, the Court seemed to hold that that
m immer had done Finney a good turn—given him sav
£2OO worth of experience for £4O (!).
Young Stanley Moss, late of Windsor, N.S.W., has
made such rapid strides as a violinist at Brussels Con-
servatoire that the famous Ysaye, writing to the lad’s
father, informs him that the director has chosen Moss out
of 60, who passed the Conservatoire examination, to fill
the vacant place of first violin in his orchestra.
The troubles of the cheap bush pro. are many and
various. One co. not long since played “East Lynne”
in the backblocks with a cast of four. One man did
Francis Levison, Richard Hare, old Justice Hare, the
man-servant, and Lady Isabel’s guardian—five characters
in all. A lady did Barbara Hare and Little Willie, and
two more people did the other characters. The co. did
its own scene-shifting, and the remaining member was
bill-sticker, business manager, and money-taker. One
especially disastrous night of “East Lynne ” left the co.
with 17s. all told, and it became necessary to walk to the
next town, 15 miles away, and hump the props. The co.
slept in a vineyard en route, Lady Isabel and Barbara
Hare being discreetly planted by themselves, while
Levison went round with a stick to keep off snakes.
S.G. : “ After pondering over many late shows. Wanted
a ‘don’t-care-a-damn-age ’ actor—(look at the list—
Davenapt, Betterton, Shakespeare, Macready, Kean,
Foot, Montgomery, Brooke, and plenty more). " The pre-
sent day mummer is mostly a mere creature of the stage-
manager, who loses his intellectual rigidity in a profound
desire not to spoil his pretty clothes or fall over the hired
furnishings. There is an opening as wide and broad and
deep as the Bottomless Pit for an acter with brains, and
blood in them.”
“ Fanny Brough is the moving spirit in a Diamond
Jubilee scheme to form an English Acting Academy on
the lines of the French Conservatoire,” writes The Bul-
letin’s London correspondent. “ Privately she is
vivacious and sparkling with naught of brother Bob’s
lugubriousness, and on the stage the most popular drama
or comedy actress in London. She resides in plutocratio
Bohemia—St. John’s Wood—with her mother, Miss Romer
—whose eyes are much improved—and the slightly-more-
embonpointed Brenda Gibson, now playing with much
success in Ellen Terry’s ‘ Olivia,’ at the Lyceum.”
Melb. journalist : “ In a newspaper I read something
about Mr. Brough’s comedy ‘troupe.’ Once I wrote of
Lyster's opera co. as a troupe. He came tugging his
beard and fuming to the editor with, ‘ Damme, sir ! Do
you think I keep dogs and monkeys?’”
Haresfoot : “ Miss Soldene, in her autobiog., tells how
her first chance was replacing Julia Matthews in ‘The
Grand Duchess of Gerolstein,’ at Covent Garden, London.
Julia was the Melb. star, 35 years back, in the burlesques
where Fawcett Rowe took off £. £. Smith, and other
celebrities. It is alleged that Burke, of Burke and Wills,
only went on his exploring expedition because Miss
Matthews refused him, and that he haunted the theatre
»'” n she played. She married a Mr. Mumford, ofMaori-
land.”
riacon Geoghegan was dancing on Shakespeare’s chest
as merrily as ever last Melb. Shakespeare society’s meet-
ing. By the way, what’s become of the parson who
theorised lately about Poacher Bill being an illegitimate
son of the Virgin Queen’s?

The Bulletin has persistently maintained that
the only way to get a decent railway system without
differential rates, cut-throat border tariffs, diverse gauges
and the many other extravagances that now prevail, is to
make the lines Federal property with one central manage-
ment for all Australia. The Convention favors instead
the establishment of a Federal Commission which will fix
uniform rates for uniform distances, so that commerce
can always go to the nearest port (if there is any avail-
able road). Otherwise things are to be left to provincial
management as before. But Commissioner Eddy’s evi-
dence as to how he proposes to work the uniform-rate
business effectually blasts the prospects of this device.
On the surface, “ uniform rates ” simply mean that rates
will be uniform ; for instance, it is 288 miles from Junee
to Sydnev, and the same distance from Junee to Mel-
bourne, therefore dull, common people take a uniform-
rate to mean that the freight will be the same from
Junee to either city. Commissioner Eddy figures it out
quite differently. Freights diminish (in one sense) as
distances increase ; say the rate for a certain class of
goods is fixed at ss. per ton for 50 miles, it may then be
9s. 6d. for 100 miles, 16s. 6d. for 200 miles, 21s. 6d. for 300
miles, 255. per ton for 400 miles, and all distances beyond
that. Therefore : Junee to Sydney, 288 miles, £1 Is. 6d.
per ton. If the same goods were sent Melbourne-wards,
however, the distance would be counted as follows : Junee
to Albury (where the N.S.W. system ends), 100 miles, 9s.
6d. ; Albury to Melbourne (Victorian system), 190 miles,
16s. 6d. ; consequently, for that 288 miles the
freight would be £1 ‘6s. Commissioner Eddy says
this is what he calls equal freights. Commissioner
Mathieson, of Victoria, says that what he calls equal
freights are that the rate should be the same from the
half-way town to either Melbourne or Sydney, and that
anything else is only a juggle and a swindle, or something
like that. As Eddy’s idea of equal rates for equal
distances would enable N.S.W., when the Barrier railway
is finished, to make the freights pretty nearly as high
from Broken Hill to Adelaide (about 300 miles) as from
the same town to Sydney (900 miles), it is likely the S.A.
people will make remarks very like Mathieson s. When
the rival managements can’t even agree on the meaning
of “ uniform rates,” the prospects of arriving at any good
results under the present divided control look about as
small as a baby microbe.

Sydney Teleoraph seems to have curiously
misread the financial proposals of the Convention. These
were as follows : “ That during the first five years after
the uniform tariff has come into operation, the Federal
Government shall continue to keep such statistics as may
be necessary to secure the distribution of the surplus to
each State, on the s une bar is as that adopted during pre-
vious years, but so that the amount to be returned
during any year shall not be less than the amount re-
turned during the year previous to the uniform tariff
having come into operation.” This means that at first,
until the Federal Government shall devise a uniform
system, each province shall retain its own tariff, the
revenue received from each province shall be kept
separate, it shall be debited with its share of the expendi-
ture, and get back the surplus. When the Federal
tariff comes into force, each province shall for five
years still have its revenue and expenditure kept
separate, and shall get back the surplus “on the
same basis in other words, it shall get back
its own surplus, and the Federal Government
promises to raise so much revenue that the surplus re-
turned to each province shall be not less —though it may
be a lot more—than it was before the uniform tariff was
created. The Teleoraph, by some quaint inversion of
things, reads that each province shall get back not more
than the “ unalterable minimum ” it received under the
separate tariffs, and it publishes huge masses of figures
to demonstrate that the other provinces will, therefore,

Maoriland finishes the financial year with a sur-
plus of £340,000, including a small balance brought for-
ward from the previous year, and it is proposed to put
£200,000 of this into the Public Works Fund. But the
fund can’t live on the casual and unreliable surplus alone,
so the Seddon Government is floating its £1,000,000 loan
ta keep things going. There will never be an end to bor-
rowing for public works until the Govt, sets aside taxes
(which will yield at least £500,000 a year) for this especial
purpose, and causes the proceeds of them to be paid into
a fund altogether apart from the regular revenue. Maori-
land has had a remarkably prosperous career—and its
public debt has increased during the 12 months by
£1,270,682. The “ self-reliant policy” again !

The Victorian State Land Bank proposes to get
to work in real earnest by raising, every fortnight,
a loan of about £25,000, at 3 per oent., as heretofore.
It is calculated that this amount will just about keep pace
with the advances made on mortgage, and there will thus
be no loss of interest through money lying idle. If the
department can run the business on this basis, Victoria
will have the best and most economically-managed Land
Bank in Australasia, and will be in a position to advance
nearly £700,000 a year at not much over one-half what
the sweated borrower has hitherto been paying. The
relief whieh this will afford to the harassed agricultural
industry in the course of a few years is almost beyond
•calculation.

The National Bank announces that, on 22nd
July, it will pay off another 15 per cent, of its recon-
structed deposits, making 67 per cent, paid off in all.
This clears off all liabilities up to the end of 1899 The
Bank*of Victoria pays another instalment on 12th July,
which will make about £4,000,000 paid out of the original
liability of £6,000,000. Both institutions reckon on get-
ting rid of the last of their reconstructed deposits early
next year. t »
After a long silence, the Royal Bank (Mel-
bourne') Days a 3 percent, dividend. The profits for the
half-year 3 are £3398, as against £2044 last half, £2099 at
March ’96, and £2038 and £2136 for the two halves of 90.
The figures, therefore, show a handsome improvement.
The Roval lately wrote off the accumulated balance at
credit of profit and loss (£21,521), and £150,000 (one-half)
of its capital, and as these amounts amount to a good
deal more than half the shareholders’ funds, they ought
to fully cover all losses and possible losses, and make the
institution absolutely solid. The dividend absorbs
£2250, so the Royal starts its new career with
a balance of £ll4B. And it should take this
opportunity to decide that it will put away 25 per cent, of
its pr lilts, in good years and bad, as a reserve fund, until
the said reserve fund reaches at least £150,000. A bank
with 150,000 capital, no reserve, and only tIUS of
accumulations is likely to be a very small earthen pot to
the end of its days unless it takes some such resolution as
the above. The Royal has apparently a good little busi-
ness ■ it has a very solid cash reserve equal to 27 per cent.
on liabilities, and it ought to do a lot better in the future
than it has been doing of late years.

Fanner and Co., of Sydney, has been floated
into a hig absentee co. (capital, £350,000) in London.
This huge drapery was always more or less of a British
institution, and now it will, presumably, be British alto-
gether. If anyone could produce an accurate list of the
British and other foreign concerns in Sydney, and show
just how little the cornstalk owns of his own city, it

fit Building Society (Sydney), as the result of a year’s
work, pays 7 per cent, to shareholders, writes off £2095

times like the present, there is money in the building
society business, if the society sticks to its own business,
and keeps clear of the delusive suburban estate that is
cut up into time-payment allotments.

The saddest piece of financial news just now is
to the effect that the Tenterfield (N.S.W.) beet-sugar
scheme has fallen through for the present, because the
British capitalist won’t put up the needful £20,000. The
self-reliant province of N.S.W.—which claims to be the
richest country on this earth, and has over £7,000,000 of
gold in its banks, and which is always talking about its
amazing progress and enterprise—wouldn’t risk this
microscopic sum to start a new enterprise out of which
commonplace Germans and Frenchmen and Russians and
other trash make millions annually. But it followed its
usual instinct and howled on the door-mat of Father Bull
for assistance, and as he wasn’t on the show apparently
collapses like a house of cards.

Auckland city (M.L.) is enjoying an experience
of the ways of private enterprise. A long time ago it was
agreed to give to a syndicate the sole right of construct-
ing, owning, and working electric tramways in the city
for 21 years. The dunderheaded local Council, however,
quite forgot to make it obligatory on the syndicate to
construct and work the trams, so that it could, if it
pleased, simply do nothing and prevent anybody else
doing anything for the best part of a generation. The
syndicate didn t build any trams, but by-and-bye it de-
manded an extension of the monopoly to 30 years. This
time the Council had sense enough to require a deposit
of £lOOO as a guarantee that the syndicate would really
do something, and, the terms being agreed to, it gave the
sole right for 30 years as demanded. In its usual
premature way, however, it gave the concession be-
fore the £lOOO deposit was forthcoming, and neither
it nor the electric tramway has, so far, appeared.
Next the syndicate demands an extension of its
monopoly to 50 years, and practically admits that
it really isn’t going to build any trams at all ;
its purpose is to sell the concession in London at a big
figure, and let the company that will be floated there do
the building, or not do it, as it pleases. The syndicate
frankly admits that it wants the 50-year monopoly to
make the concession more saleable —so that it may get a
larger sum for doing nothing at all. This latest demand
will probably be a failure, but even as things are the syn-
dicate, if it likes to deposit £lOOO, which is a very
moderate amount after all, can block all improvement of
Auckland's primitive tram way-service for 30 years, and if
it can’t sell its concession to advantage in London, it will
probably lie low and keep on blocking the wav' until the
city gives it £20,000 or £50,000 or so, to surrender its
“ rights ” and get out of the road. Meanwhile the years
roll on, and the primitive horse-tram toils about the
streets as usual, and as the Council has given to the
syndicate, practically gratis, the right to forbid any im-
provement until 1926 unless it is bought off, the old,
square vehicle and the old, angular oats’-meat fainting in
the shafts are likely to be permanent institutions.
Victorian brandy is now supplied in the refresh-
ment-room of the British House of Commons, it is used
to some extent by the British army, and the General
Asylum Tender Board admits it as being of equal quality
with the famous brands of Ilennessy and Martell. Yet
the local drinker doesn’t drink it as a rule ; he briefly
describes it as “ colonial rubbish” ; and Victoria imports
about 75,000 gallons of brandy and alleged brandy
annually from Europe in order that it may have the joy
of swallowing real foreign rotgut. The cheerful, off-hand
assumption that everything local, except pugilists, foot-
ballers and wool, is “colonial rubbish” is one of the chief
curses of this country.

One of the subjects to which the interprovincial
railway-commissioners gave attention at their conference
in Adelaide was the sale of tickets by unauthorised
ao-ents. This industry alone provides a tip-top living for
three persons in Sydney, five in Melbourne, and three in
Adelaide and Brisbane, to whom may be added can-
vassers, outside runners, and clerks. It is estimated that
the combined loss to the railways from this source amounts
to between £3OOO and £4OOO annually. The reason no
prosecutions have been instituted so far is that tickets
are only subject to the by-laws of the province of issue,
and, as the return halves are mostly sold in the other
provinces, the difficulties and expense of prosecution
would not be recouped by the fine imposed. Under Fed-
eration, of course, this would be done away with, but
meanwhile, it is understood, the commissioners have ar-
ranged a scheme which, it is hoped, will materially check
this leakage in the revenue.

The secession of MTlwraith, M‘Eacharn and
Co from the Westralian freights-and-fares schedule of the
Associated Steamship Association means a big fight, al-
most to a finish. No one need be surprised if a man will be
able soon to get from Sydney to Perth for “ a note.” But
the future will be as the past. The co’s that don t knock
under wall pool and make up for temporary losses by
awful extortions. Besides, the “lowness of freights,”
the “absence of profits,” etc., will give shipowners an
apparent justification for “reducing expenses” (wages)
when the chance comes.

As illustrating the never-ending audacity of
“bust” banks, a case before Chief Justice Madden, in
Melbourne, the other day, is interesting. One Ferguson
sued the liquidator of the City of Melb. Bank, to recover
certain moneys paid into that financial sink in error,
Before the City went under, Ferguson drew a cheque on
his account to pay two creditors in England, and the usual
drafts were sent along. This overdrew the customer’s
account £ll9. Believing the drafts would be 0.K., Fer-
guson subsequently paid this £ll9 into the bank. But
the Citv of M. broke, and refused to meet the drafts, and,
furthermore, the wild-time bank blandly declined to
ante up the £ll9 The customer sued to recover, and it
is comforting to know that the financial institution was
compelled to disgorge, the verdict being an assurance
that all the money a broken bank gets hold of under any
circumstances is not its own to have and to hold, till the
crack of doom or thereabouts. #

The jumpers of the Homeward Bound mine,
Yalwal (N.S.W.), having abandoned the intention to
appeal to the Privy Council, that co. can now resume
work on the mine. Small satisfaction this, after having
had the mine shut up for three years. The fear of
jumping is the greatest curse Australasian mining has
to put up with. For the hundredth time, why should a
jumper, who may be, and often is, the meanest creature
on earth, get the mine he jumps? Why shouldn’t he be
paid a fee, like the hangman, while the State more or less
heavily fines the defaulting lessees, or, in extreme cases,
auctions the mine, its own property, for the benefit of the
consolidated revenue ?

Golconda, Parkes, N.S.W. : “Reef more
pinched, but widened and looks better ; hauled about
three tons of stone, have another ton ready for hauling.”
How, in Heaven’s name, is all this hauling done? By a
windlass ? Then why does it not get the credit of it ? Is
the windlass working well? If so, why not at once say
so in the S.M.H., D.T., and other well-known and re-
spectable newspapers ?
Says the London correspondent of the S.M.
Herald :—“ The difficult task of selecting an inspector
of mines for N.S.W. out of the numerous applicants has
at last been accomplished.” Only from this source it is
learnt that 82 applicants were reduced to 6 by the Agent-
General, and one has been recommended for the post.
That England is not the best place in the world to go for
mining-inspectors, nor for mining men of any kind needed
in the working of Australian mines, there is surely ample
evidence. Men trained in the big mines of Australia are
quitegood enough to inspect mines in N. S.W. Australians
are considered good enough for such work in the other
provinces. » * *

Westralian mining news from a reliable
source “ Our mines (Hannan’s) are doing wonderfully
well. The Great Boulder has a good lode of from three
to five ounce ore on the 300, and all the other parts of the
mine are looking well. The Lake View mine is getting
into shape, and it will do all that people have claimed for
it. The Ivanhoe at the 300 was a disappointment to some,
but where the crosscuts strike the vein it has always been
of lower grade in the upper levels. The Horseshoe mine
is also looking very |well. The Australia is developing
large bodies of telluride ore. The reef at one point must
be 20ft. wide, and it can be shipped as it comes from the
mine for 6oz. to the ton average. By putting up Ropp
furnaces and cyaniding after roasting, they will be able to
extract over 90 per cent, at a cost of less than 40s. Quite
a number of tests have already been made by roasting
and cyaniding, and the extraction runs up to 96 per cent.
The next mine to open up on the 300 will be the Lake
View ; this will be done during the next six weeks.”

We have to go to London for news of the
General Gordon, W.A. “For some time it has been
known that the 43ft.-wide reef has not gone down as was
anticipated, and more recently it has le .ked out that the
rich stringers of opaline quartz, which furnished such
splendid assay returns, have disappeared. As nearly as
is known, the Gordon has about 1000 tons of valuable ore
at grass, 400 tons of which is being crushed. What will
happen after this no man knoweth. Not even the expert
manager, Prof. Krause, can say whether the main reef
will be picked up again lower down. For the sake of W.A.
interests in the London market it is satisfactory to learn
that only a very small number of General Gordon shares
are held on this side,” says a London paper. No suoh
news has ever been known here. The writer is once more
really sorry for the tipsters who have gone on tipping Gor-
dons up to't.he last. The strong doubts expressed months
ago in this column about the Gordon were founded on
examinations by three mining men, not one of whom had
the slightest interest in the mine. In 99 cases in 100
opinions of any other sort are not worth having. The present
writer is sorry to say that there are not “1000 tons of valu-
able ore at grass as the battery will soon prove. The
former manager—and there are few better in W.A. —made
no secret of his opinion of the mine ; and now we have
the ominous silence of Professor Krause and the unmis-
takeable verdict of the share-market.

Allen H. P. Stoneham, at the meeting, held in
London early in March, to protest against the labor con-
ditions and titles of mining leases in W.A., presided over
by Remember-Me-No-More Robinson: “He was very
much interested in W.A. The country was at present
under a cloud, and he could not but think that a great
deal of the depression waa owin'; to the adverse conditions
which governed the mining industry.” A much greater
deal of it is due to several other things. The hundreds of
thousands paid for mining-swindles, the hundreds of
thousands wasted on machinery for which there never
was any use, and the hundreds of thousands taken to
work off wild-cats by false reports, bribing newspapers, and
general boodle, have had a heap to do with the depres-
sion. To protest against) the labor-conditions, and to
demand better titles, are" only miserable excuses for rob-
bery and failure —and well these gentry know it.

A short-hand report of the evidence at the in-

and a clerk in the office of the Queen Margaret No. 1
South, W.A., has been issued. When the shares were at
a premium there were 7200 shares unapplied for. These
were issued to the clerk at 2s. each ; and the investigating
Board finds that two of the late directors “ did expect to
be allowed to participate therein or in the profits to be
derived therefrom.” A late official also “ admits that he
accepted from the clerk one-sixth of the 7200 shares at
cost with a view of making a profit thereon and not for
the purpose of protecting the company.” This week the
shareholders meet to decide upon a course of action.

Ope of the unfortunate dupes who came out to
the golden West to do something in connection with’the
imaginary properties of W.A. Gold District Trading Cor-
poration writes : —“ Most mining wild-cats do possess a
lease of some kind or other, but the co. now in liquidation
actually advertised a ‘ 300oz.-to-the-ton-rock-absolutely-
co vie red-with-gold ’ mine belonging to another co. alto-
gether as their own, presumably on the ground that the
manager had brought an action against them for non-
delivery of machinery under contract. The founders’
shares in this concern dropped in three months from £105
to 9s., and the philanthropist who engineered it has
dropped right out.” Truly an awful sample of Westralian

Now is the time for some well-informed

that Reid is a young and stately gentleman with

beroo Assembly, and made a fortune as a squatter
at Manly (S.A.). Some pathetic remarks about
the half-caste son returning to England to intro-
duce himself to his haughty relatives at the an-
cestral halls would come in well just here. A few
more items like these will be accepted readily by
the London papers, and will hit pretty hard the
well-informed people who are doing the work at
present.
THE BOGGED COW: A TALE OF A TALL.
“The buzz of the Diamond Jubilee
chorus,” writes The Bulletin’s London cor-
respondent, “is beginning to be heard in
the land. Soon lengthy, lathy, big-boned men
with bronzed, hungry faces will be here from
‘afar off’and ‘ way back,’ and add an unobtru-
sive humming refrain to the all-pervading and
prevailing babel of many accents greeting the
breaking of the reign record. Not that they will
care much for the tenacious Guelphic grip of a
velvet billet, but Victoria has broken the English
record on a ‘ Slumber ’ machine, so ‘ let us drink
and be merry for to-morrow we fly ’ —back to
jumbucks and Jericho, bovines and blasting,
sweating and swearing, and ‘ graft ’ everlasting.
Much 1 bitter ’ in London means much bitter-
ness in the street, and the wheel of a ’bus occa-
sionally steers the soul of the stumbler to the land
of the Never-come-back on the stream of internal
hemorrhage. Her Gracious, scared by senile
superstition, declines to date the f6te, but the
Government has hired several storeys of the
huge Hotel Cecil, and the directors thereof
breathe freely again.”

A certain Australasian Governor struck a
snag the other day. His private sec. by letter
intimated to the leading country hotelkeeper that
H.E. intended honoring his establishment with
his presence during a forthcoming local shivoo.
But Boniface knew H.E’s strong points, and
wrote back that he “ wasn’t taking any Governor.”

Led by Lady Gormanston and aided and
abetted by the great Dobson clan of both sexes,
the women and girls of Tasmania jubilate at the
Longest Reign by presenting a memorial to Queen
Victoria. The smallest contributions gratefully
accepted, and each subscriber is to have her name
attached to the congratulatory memorial in alpha-
betical order. Any small change left over after
the memorial is paid for is to go towards augment-
ing the ’B7 Jubilee Fund for the relief of con-
valescent women. The alphabetical order idea
ought to boom the thing, especially among the first
letters of the alphabet. But no province, however
loyal, can be expected to grovel persistently all
the way from A. to Z.

About the latest idea for a great Record Reign celebra-
tion is that all the people of the empire should sing a
hymn of rejoicing at the same moment, the signal to
begin being sent by cable from London and repeated
along every telegraph wire in Her Majesty’s dominions.
The Bulletin doesn’t know enough about telegraphic
work to say whether the mechanical part of the scheme is
possible or not, but it knows for certain that a lot of Her
Majesty’s faithful subjects can’t sing, andalot more won’t
sing, because they will be away at the dog-fight, or bash-
ing each other with bottles down the harbor ; and quite a
large number will be too drunk to sing on this particular
occasion. Still, by way of doing its share, it has got the
hymn ready, and asks that the production be sung slowly
in a doleful key, as befits the solemnity of the occasion.
It is reasonably short and almost anv kind of tune will
fit

town council was discussing the most appropriate
way of commemorating the Record Reign):—

“ The Bishops of
London and Rochester,
and Bishop Barry, late
of Sydney, are preaching
midnight sermons for
men only in St. James’
(church), Piccadilly, as
a counter attraction to
the cosmopolitan sirens
on the pavements out-
side coaxing and solicit-
ing passengers for the
broad and pleasant path
to Hades,” writes The
Bulletin’s London cor-
respondent. “The pew-
openers and tract-distri-
butors are ‘ saved ’ scions
of society and members
of the White Cross
leagues, but the sermons
are not risque enough
to combat successfully
the fascination of the
Sisters of the White
Frill Legion. And Old
Nick sits on a white-hot
grid, crosses his legs,
rests one foot on a has-
sock of glowing embers,
and chuckles until his
fire-withered lungs rus-
tle against his ribs at the
number of mothers’ dar-
ling boys who now haunt
the “Dilly,” wandering
into ‘Jimmy’s’ (St.
James’ Restaurant), and
wondering whether he
has struck the heavenly
banquet-hall until an
‘angel’ invites herself tc
supper at his expense,
when he knows he has
struck ruination Sheol.
The mothers love their
boys for the religious
fervor that keeps them
out till 2 or 3 a.in.”

“I hate fashionable Victorians,” said a
character in one of Francis Adams’ Bulletin
stories, “ they are such snobs—they are worse
than English people. ” The Australasian, in its
notice of Rudyard Kipling’s “ Seven Seas ” vol.,
speaks of the capture of a battery “by a half-
drunken company of soldiers and a tipsy captain.”

Sydney society is curious to know whether
a prospective benedict of Scotch descent, whose
wedding is to be a very tremendous affair, will
enter the marriage state in kilts. If so, he must
be very careful to mind the step, as the spectacle
of a kilted bridegroom coming to grief on a slack
carpet would shake any woman’s confidence in
him as a husband. Many a honeymoon has been
wrecked for less.

Dear Bulletin, —The
particularity of the Jews
about butchers’ meat may
have something to do with
their comparative immunity
from consumption, but there
is another reason. Tuber-
cular disease is the curse of
northern and western races
—the Hebrew is oriental and
(as regards the northern
hemisphere) southern. Pul-
monary consumption tak-
ing no account of exotic cases
—becomes steadily rarer as
you pass S.E. from, say,
England to Egypt ; and,
even amongst northern
peoples, the black-haired and
swarthy individuals (pre-
sumably with southern affini-
ties) are markedly more im-
mune than the fair, freckly,
and frigid.— Speculum.

One wealthy Australian Governor is achiev-
ing a reputation for meanness which is “more
than proverbial: it is damnable.” He is held bv
local cabbies especially, ■in withering contempt.
Two instances : one day he and his secretary took
a cab down town, drove to Government House
stayed there 15 minutes, and then—well, the job
in all extended over six miles, occupying quite an
hour - landed up half-a-
ero wn. “What’s this ?” said Jehu. » Your fare t”
replied the vice-rex. “But my regulation fare is
four-and-six ! persisted the cabby. Then the
rich man doled out another shilling with a grunt,
“There, that’s all you’ll get.” The same im-
ported satrap has conscientious scruples against
working his own carriage, etc., on Sundays, but
goes to church in a public vehicle. The other
Sabbath the “ party ” consisted of nine, and when
cabby delivered his load at the place of worship
he was rewarded with eighteen-pence ! He cursed
—even though it was Sunday.

Some undermining Queenslanders have
sent their gracious sovereign a present of a large
consignment of ripe mangoes. The mango is that
deceiving yellow fruit with the brick in the centre,
that bursts and squirts juice in all directions when
you put your teeth in it, and hangs down in long,
moist strings, and makes you gummy all over,
even inside your clothes, and unfit for human
society. The natural result of sending mangoes
to Queen Victoria just now is that she will be too
sticky to celebrate anything next June, and won't
be able to see the ambassadors and premiers and
other potentates on account of the juice in her
hair and on her hands, and the stringy things in
her back tooth. Her Gracious is probably unac-
quainted with the mango, and the only way air

Melb. : “ Miss Sutherland has broken
with the churches. She hires large halls in the
suburbs, on Sunday nights, makes speeches on her
work amid the child waifs, empties tabernacles,
and gets thumping collections. She wants to
know why the pastors talk about the Children of
Israel, thousands of years ago, while the Children
of Melb. are ruined in Chinese opium dens.”
Here are the facts, as stated by Miss Suther-
land at a public meeting, about a matter which
has been put endways in print. A few years
ago she rescued a street Arab who told her
of another. She followed up and caught this
boy, too, and then tracked out his mother in a
wretched Melb. opium den. She had stolen the
boy away from Ireland because he was entitled to
£13,000 and she to nothing. Miss Sutherland
established the boy’s claim to the money. He is
now being educated at a first-class R.C. college in
Ireland.

Col. Smith, who now commands the

be remembered that the mokes which accompanied
the N.S.W. artillery to the Soudan were provided
by the Sydney ’Bus Co., and were utterly unused
to dragging guns. In fact, they were so inured to
pulling omnibuses that they obstinately refused to
move until the gun-driver had made a noise like
the banging of a ’bus-door. The doors of the co.’s
’busses never did bang, by the way, but that is a
mere detail.

from cycling than they ever thought or hoped was

to be discussed in these columns, I might tell of several
interesting domestic events that would not have happened

. -The Cretan Trouble. —The Eastern Question
is monopolising the interest of the whole world.
Round the island of Crete the Great Powers are
concentrated—so many lions all hungry for the
spoil, all fearing and mistrusting each other. A
touch, and they would all fall upon each other.
Savants say the lions must be blooded ; the im-
mense and ruinously costly armaments of Europe
are spoiling for a fight. The diplomacy exercised
in the trouble has brought affairs to a very
invidious issue. Fancy such a muddle as Crete
having autonomy under the supervision of the
Powers and at the same time remaining a portion
of the Turkish Empire! What a policy of Graft
all the diplomatists are pursuing ! It is only
Cameron’s Two Seas Tobacco that can preserve
peace in such a crisis.*

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
~ _ Sydney, April 13,1897.
Mt Dear Myee—
Red is so much the tint of fashion just now that
the Orotava, when around near Perim, endeavored
to give the modish hue to her cargo of finery by
having the Red Sea pumped into her forehold.
Among the deluged dresses was Hon. Margaret
Brand’s wedding-gown, which an unfeeling and dirty
deck-hose squirted along with many other bridal
garments now hung out to dry on the vice-regal
clothes-line. The dress was not irreparably
damaged, and will be worn at the ceremony next
Wednesday. Several high-toned leaders of fashion
had cases per same boat full of chiffon and feathers
now reduced to pulp. In fact, nearly every
woman in Sydney seems to have lost something
by the immersion. This excuse for last season’s
gown appearing at swagger functions this season
will probably be well-worn—“ You know, my dear,
all my imported things were in the Orotava.”
The “ Matsa ” mummies emerged from their
sarcophagi for the last time in Sydney on Satur-
day afternoon and evening. The afternoon resus-
citation was for the benefit of Florence Young,
who farewelled amid much enthusiasm and feeling.
As Clanside, in “In Town,” put on to give
Florence’s admirers a last sight of her in swallow-
tails and other things, she speechified a little on
her own, and choked audibly over saying good-
bye. “ You don’t know how much I feel saying
farewell to you all,” she faltered, and the audience,
standing up to get a last view, sniffed in sympathy
and regretted that Florence Young’s clear, fresh
voice will be heard no more on this side. Another
adieu was made by Knowles, and he also had to
say a few words. Likewise, at the evening per-
formance, he had some dry, up-and-down things
to say of The Bulletin —which, it would appear,
hasn’t gushed sufficiently over him. By the way,
in the press ballet’s final parade, The Bulletin
girl was the sole newspaper woman to get a hand ;
her smart black-and-pink has been applauded
right through the season.
Another final appearance on Saturday was that
of Juliet Wray, who settles down matrimonially
at Auckland, M.L., as Mrs. Sharman, after a
month with “ Matsa ” in Adelaide and a probable
trip to the West with the Co. She is to introduce
a turn into the third act in imitation of Knowles,
and will sing “ On the Benches ” in battered hat’
long coat, white trousers and lengthy boots. That
high-class ballad has caught on here far more than
in Melbourne, where there isn’t nearly so much
obvious flirtation as on the shores of our ’arbor.
Experts say that the oscillatory average here is
much higher per girl than it is down south.
At the first concert of the new season of Sydney
Amateur Orchestral Society, held on Wednesday
last week at the Centennial Hall, two original
works were presented to the musical followers of
Signor Hazon. A triumphal march, “ the Queen’s
Reign,” by E. de Beaupuis, was played to loud
applause. The composer was present and listened
to the frantic feelings evoked by his loyal outburst
without bowing his thanks from the platform. An
extract from a cantata “Hinemoa,” by a Maori-
land composer, introduced a real Maori song
played to a twittery string accompaniment. It
was characteristic, but was not so loudly applauded
as the brilliant march, because it didn’t end with
a riotous crash on the drums and cymbals like the
bang when the low comedian sits down on the
stage. That always fetches an audience. Alfred
Hill’s Maori music is interesting apart from in-
trinsic merit, as it is almost the first attempt to
preserve the beautiful native melodies of the
Pacific. J. C. Williamson is looking for a theme
for next Xmas. There’s an opera ready-made for
him in any South Sea village, with the pathetic
minor strains and wild original dances of the
islanders set to an accompaniment of the roar of
the surf on the coral reef and incessant rustling of
the palms.
The Cardinal, in blessing the Australian Fair
into existence last Wednesday, gave a very
modern turn to an old church miracle—the story
of how the votive gifts of some medieeval faithful
were turned into fragrant roses shedding sweet-
ness all around—by piously hoping that the
miracle would be repeated to-day and brought up
to date by the fair offerings being transmuted into
good hard cash. Roses are cheap ; but any prac-
tical-minded saint would make a large bid for
popularity to day by substituting for them the
yellow metal, and I suppose it would be just as
easy for him while he was about the transforma-
tion business. But heavenly intervention to-day
is superseded by the worldly, though effective,
raffle and race-game. The Fair is a vast surg-
ing crowd of buyers and sellers, principally
sellers ; before the show is over numerous
“Puritans” and Indians and “ Colleen Bawns ”
will be swapping raffles among themselves
to keep the thing going after the four days’
suspension of business during this week. The
stalls are crammed with the ordinary fairings—
multitudes of dolls, inscrutable and unuseable
articles made of crash towelling and twisted
string, cushions and chair-backs in loud plush
worked with aggressive patterns in positively
yelling colors ; also, many mirror-paintings. The
artistic merit of any exhibition is gauged by the
prevalence of looking-glass lilies and ducks among
rushes. There is much ecclesiastical lingerie
intricately needleworked, and some ecclesiastical
oil-paintings at Is. a member, and a signed photo,
of a royalty or two at a cheaper rate. And there
are some truly awe-inspiring landscapes ; it must
require heroic courage to put such pictures forth
as attractions. And one of the most thrilling
sights of the Fair is the wicked Mr. Tom Slattery
in a blue art-muslin bower raffling dolls—probably
by way of penance.
Convent needlework is famous, and that ex-
hibited at the Fair is quite exceptionally good.
Nuns are just the kind of people to have invented
plain sewing, a most elaborate form of torture for
highly-strung girls. After a whole afternoon’s
pricking hot little chubby fingers with a rebellious
and sticky needle, a chastened and meek spirit is
induced in the most fidgetty child. In these
blessed days of machines for'making everything—
even button-holes —it isn’t necessary to strain one’s
eyes and nerves over “ felling ” and “ seaming ”
and “gathering ” and “stroking.” German girls
spend half their time in sewing garments and
hoarding them in their “ wedding-chests,” and
the consequence is that the whole nation wears
spectacles. The modern child is revolting against
too much needlework, and even a nunnery has to
keep up with the times, so to attract pupils some
convents allow skirt-dancing and cricket.
The Arawatta Tennis Club entertained a town
hall full of people at Redfern last Thursday with
music and lime-lit tableaux. The first picture was
rather a gruesome subject, representing a pretty
girl lying on a bed as a corpse banked with white
blossoms, which the light refused to work on, and
the audience had its feelings harrowed in the
dark. The next, called “ A Mouse,” showed four
women on as many chairs, clutching skirts —no-
body played the title-rdle, by the way. Again the
lights failed after one brief glimpse of ankles.
“ Taken at a Disadvantage,” a well-arranged kiss-
ing scene, was the most successful of the series.
Monthly evening meetings at the Phillip-street
ladies’ club are blossoming into a regular institu-
tion. Last Monday the company politely and
silently simmered or suffocated while it listened
to a discourse on the original woman’s letter-
writer, Mme. de S4vign4, by M. Bulteau, entitled
“ Mons.” in the programme—which purely British
abbreviation of the French for “ Mister ” always
recalls Mons. Provo—he seems to be the only
legally-qualified “ Mons.” in Australia. The lec-
turer propounded the interesting, but not quite
correct, paradox that in France the best soldier,
the best statesman, the best scientist, and the
best journalist have all been women. Other items
were the charming piano solo of Mme. Kellermann,
and the ardent Italian warbling of the new bari-
tone, who was the lion of the evening for the
women present, while the neglected men scowled
about in doorways.
Owing to a desire to be in the movement, the
two women’s clubs of Melbourne and Sydney are
going to federate to the extent of conferring
honorary-membership on members of each club
visiting the other’s city for a limited time. The
local convention looks towards its elder sister for
much instruction and guidance in various little
matters of management—but it has not yet
plagiarised the brilliant notion of the Austral
Salon in having the afternoon meetings on a Mon-
day, by which worried members with houses to
keep may always be out on washing-day, and so
escape the steam and soapsuds, confusion and
cold-meat tea of the first day of the week.
Salonites are, of course, too intellectual to stay
home and help the overworked “ general ” through
with the pegging-out, and it would never occur to
them to hash the mutton and serve it hot for the
evening meal.
The alarm of fire raised at the Cleveland-st.
school-concert in Centennial Hall last week
showed what a serious thing a panic would be in a
building packed with about 5000 persons, mostly
children. Junior pupils as midshipmites were
marching by limelight when suddenly something
exploded, and everybody scrambled for the doors.
In a very short time the little boys resumed the
procession, by a wise direction the piano played,
and the reassured audience came back again—all
looking a trifle disappointed at the tame fizzle-out
to the scare. Some of the dances were done in
fancy costumes ; “ Ye Olde Englishe Gavotte,” by
remarkably well-grown “senior boys and girls,”
was encored, as the onlookers seemed anxious to
behold again the prance on the platform at the
beginning.
A deferred celebration of Bismarck’s birthday,
postponed on account of the death of the German
Consul, was held last week by a scanty band of
patriots. Judging by the attendance, the aged
statesman doesn’t appear to be overwhelmingly
popular with his countrymen out of the Father-
land ; they sat at little tables, drank Pilsener—
they drink Pilsener when it isn’t Bismarck’s birth-
day—and listened to a brass band. One travelled
guest, impressed by the continental look of the
place, raised his voice and called “Kellner”
haughtily, and seemed disillusionised when the
waiter answered “Orright, sir,” in good Aus-
tralian.
When a man pleads, like Craddock, that he has
committed some crime or made an egregious ass
of himself “all for the sake of a girl,” everybody
pityingly says “poor fellow,” and “let him off
lightly,” and other sympathising things, as if he
had made a valid excuse. But such a plea isn’t
an excuse, it is only a reason. Nobody thinks of
compassionating the woman in the case, who very
often would have to possess a cast-iron power of
resistance to ignore the temptation of making a
cheap and useful conquest. Some men seem to be
suffering all the time for some woman to become
their fair enslaver: they are just like the little
pigs who ran about with knives and forks stuck in
their backs, saying “ Come and eat me.”
The photographing of the Lamington baby on a
water-lily leaf has created a demand in Brisbane
for large tin-trays of the correct Victoria Regia
shape whereon the Nicest infants may sit and be
photoed like the northern Gov. ’s many-named son
and heir. Formerly it was the proper thing to
have baby “ taken” lolling on his back in a mam-
moth shell. The local Courier gives the episode
as stiff and stately a par. as if it were describing
a coronation at least, and names pompously those
who were present at the “interesting function.”
When De Kontski, the veteran pianist, was in
Maoriland, the Musin concert co. was touring
there also, and rows raged continually. Two
factions were enlisted, and the Musin backers
wrote to musical head-quarters to find out the
truth of the aged Chev.’s assertion that he had
been in his youth a piano-pupil of the great
Beethoven. The reply came from the Berlin cor-
respondent of London Musical Courier that
De Kontski’s claims were bogus, in that Beethoven
was stone-deaf ere the man now claiming to be his
only living pupil could have known him. The
marvel in the case is to find that any expert should
have taken De Kontski’s youthful reminiscences
as gospel.
A batch of ballads includes “Severed,’ by L.
Ronald; “’Tis June,” by Denza ; “Rose of the
Desert,” by F. Bevan—all nice in a drawing-room-
ballady way. A duet for violin and piano,
“ Characteristic Dance,” by E. Moor, is written
within amateur powers. W. F. Hutchinson’s
“ Grand Federation March ” gives the same sen-
sation as walking upstairs in the dark and count-
ing one step too many : you expect a foothold that
isn’t there.
The only point about the Lancers’ procession
through the city on Saturday last, differentiating
it from any other military procession, was the
dejected appearance of the horses, which a dis-
respectful public jibed freely.
Now that Florence Schmidt is discussed as a
coming prima-donna, some correspondents remind
me that red hair often goes with the musical
temperament. The reason is obvious —they have
plenty of iron in their composition to impart that
magnetism which enables an artist to get hold of
his or her public. Many women of genius have
brilliant hair, not necessarily red, but shining and
glossy ; it accompanies a type of face such as may
be seen in Gainsborough’s well-known portrait of
Mrs. Siddons ( not in Mrs. B. Potter’s pretty
photographed copy of the pose). Bernhardt’s face
shows the same characteristics; so does Duse’s,
the great Italian actress, though she is worn
by illness. There is in all the same clear-
ness of chiselling and delicacy about the nostrils
marking the artistic gift, the gift most fatal to
her own solid comfort ever bestowed on woman.
That most popular annual public dance, St.
Vincent’s Hospital ball, takes place on Wednes-
day (April 21) of next week and will, judging
from the ticket-sale, be very largely attended.
Among other innovations, a flashlight photograph
of the ball will be taken by Kerry, and all holders
of ball or gallery tickets will have a chance of
securing a 25-guinea bicycle, presented to the com-
mittee by the Waltham Co. Mrs, Douglas Mac-
kenzie and Miss Doyle are the hon. secretaries.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
( “ About the spiciest of Dr. Ryder’s addresses to
‘ hens only ’ is entitled ‘ Marriage—its Rights and
Abuses.’ Consequently, the crowd at Melbourne
Athenaeum Hall last week almost fought for the
privilege of paying nothing to go in. On this
occasion one felt no anxiety concerning the sex of
the person in the next seat. Certain stage pro-
perties boldly displayed over chair-backs (not to
mention a mysterious-looking indiarubber arrange-
ment like an elongated feeding-bottle which
dangled from a red screen) were calculated to
make any artful intruder of the wrong sex pull
down his veil and flee. Incidentally it may be
remarked that the garments recommended by the
learned doctress for feminine wear don’t lean
towards the aesthetic. A melancholy dame of
tough years acted as lay-figure, whilst various
combinations of wool and elastic were back
grounded by her velvet gown. These novelties
aroused very little enthusiasm. They are probably
excellent underwear from a medical point of view,
but they would seem to justify much violent abuse
of marriage by the husband of any woman who
gave them a show.
_ “ Austria, according to the lecturess, is an ‘all-
right ’ place for Women. Within the precincts of
that composite Empire no man can get a license
to marry until he has deposited a sum of money
(in proportion to his income) with the Govern-
ment. On the birth of every child a further sum
is demanded. No infants get baptised unless the
Government receipt for them is produced, so it
often happens that the neighbors club together
and loan the deposit on the first child, just by way
of encouragement. For non-compliance with the
law the hapless father is arrested, and kept at
work in the prison till he earns the necessary
amount. As time goes on the suffering parent
makes up his mind to commit suicide, and then
his widow and orphans scoop the pool.
“ Most of the women put their best ear forward
to catch the promised information ‘ How to be a
painless mother ! ’ The theory is that by much
exercise and a vegetable diet a woman can produce
such a, soft-boned baby that the whole proceeding is
apastime, and the curse bestowed upon Evebecomes
a dead letter. Osseous matter in the form of lime
water can be poured into the new arrival after
birth. This is briefly the American science of
Tokology, which, by the way, is strongly opposed
by many sections of the medical press in that land
of wonders. However, it sounds soothing.
“ Men, says the festive Ryder, are not naturally
of stronger sexuality than women. Education
and custom have developed it in the one sex and
suppressed it in the other, until the modern con-
dition of society is the unsatisfactory result. In
condemning the fashion of keeping girls in a state
of alleged innocence, Dr. Emily quoted the
opinions of a number of European celebrities, all
in favor of full revelations, save one man, who
said, ‘ Let the girls study the Old Testament, and
no more information can be given them!’ At
which the members of the W.C.T.IJ. simply
turned up their eyes and said ‘ Blasphemous 1 ’
“Finally, women were exhorted to revolt
against accidental additions,’ and the lecturess
told a somewhat pathetic story of a region where
the sex, being determined to avoid further acci-
dents, went on strike. Whether this happened in
a book or real life was not quite clear, but, any-
way, the bloated capitalists gave in promptly, and
rang the church-bells as a signal of submission.
One would like to know what happened in the case
of irreconcilable strikers who refused to resume
duty when the bell rang.
“An up-country military youth, named Purcell
seems to have turned all the Melb. officers green
with envy by his feats of horsemanship in the
barracks riding-school, during the recent tourna-
ment. The general verdict was that a first-class
circus-rider is not in it with Purcell, who hails
from Hay and is barely of age. His father was
very anxious to see him chosen for the team going
Ome, but, like many another anxious father, was
disappointed.
“ A Wesleyan church in a Northern suburb of
Melbourne has been closed for some weeks through
the inability of the pastor and the unwillingness
of his flock to pay the gas-bill. The poor man
frequently calls upon Heaven to lighten their dark-
ness, but Heaven seems to have no influence with
the company’s myrmidon who cut off the illumi-
nant at the meter.
“An event of the week in ’igh life was a five
days’ engagement; the principals in this brief love
story being a very wealthy orphan, living in St.
Hilda, and the son of a Melb. medico. The ring
was bought, worn for two days, and returned.
Congratulations still pour in, and the unfortunate
man sits by the telephone all day, making responses
to the friends who wish him joy. After three
minutes in Collins-street, at lunch-time, his right
hand is nearly as sore as his heart, so, to save
himself further pain and embarrassment, he has
‘ Explanations ’ published in pamphlet form, for
distribution around his circle of acquaintances.
“The sister to a well-known N.S.W. squatter
has changed her views of life within the past few
weeks. A while ago she returned to Sydney from
a doleful journey to London (and thence to Wies-
baden) with four first-class medical opinions that
she had lost the sight of one eye for ever, and was in
a fair way to become quite blind. A second course
of treatment in Sydney failed to improve the
lady’s outlook. Still hoping, but not expecting
much, she was presently induced to undergo
another operation, this time at the hands of a
Melb. oculist, who has a name for brilliant work
in unpromising cases. The result, last week, was
a joyful letter written by the patient to her
mother in Sydney, under the sole supervision of
the eye that had been blind when she left home.
“Visiting Westralians find life in Victoria fiat
and dull as ditchwater. One old lady, a highly-
educated woman, who went over to Fremantle
when the bad times came and started a hotel, is
back to Melb. for a health-trip. Now she longs to
get away to the fizz and fuss of the West. Hun-
dreds of strangers pour in by every boat, she says,
and ‘ you’re always wondering how you’re going' to
accommodate your share of the swarm. It’s more
like a big, jolly, tiring old picnic than anything
else, only you’re well paid for your fatigue ! ’
“Yet another Melb. girl has achieved a military
conquest in India. Miss Blanche Thompson, a
brilliant brunette, is shortly to marry Col. Holmes
in London. The colonel and major, also a captain
in the same regiment, have been captivated by
Melb. girls, the captain and major marrying two
sisters. ”
Yours affectionately,
CLEO.
Q. Labor-party, next session, Glassey or
no Glassey, threatens to try stonewalling for
measures of reform.
Dear Bulletin, —“ Gambler,” in your
last issue, says some “ things ” about the several
art-unions well-known to the public, and lays
himself out to especially “ worry ” the “ Druids’”
Art-Union and its management. Permit me to
point out a phase of the question unaccount-
ably (?) ignored by your correspondent. The point
of his comparison of these art-unions to Tatter-
sail’s lottery is lost in the fact that whereas the
latter is a matter of business entirely, conducted
by a gentleman for the benefit of himself and
those who are the lucky winners of the great
sweeps, the former primarily represent and
espouse a certain cause. The Druids, the A.N. A.,
the Hibernians, &c., are well-known Friendly
Societies throughout Australasia Bach vies with
the other in laudable offorts to advance a
particular society, and, in order to popularise and
advertise it, the method of annual demonstra-
tion is adopted. The art-union is tacked on
to it as the best means to afford sympathisers
in every part of Australia a chance to contri-
bute something towards this huge advertisement,
and the ever-increasing sale of tickets proves that
subscribers to these art-unions recognise that no
matter how remote their chance of winning a
prize their shilling is still not misspent. As to
the matter of expenses, if “Gambler” could in-
crease results with the same expenditure, or show
the same profit with less, or produce some patriots
who will do the managerial and secretarial work
for nothing, he will earn for himself the eternal
gratitude of his fellow gamblers, your humble ser-
vant included. JBy the way, the profit for chatty
of last year’s Druids’ Demonstration was .£1916
10s., not £640, as stated by “Gambler.” —Yours,
A. S. Gordon, Representative Druids’ Gala,
Sydney.
[The Bulletin fails to see that this is even an attempt
at an answer to “ Gambler s ” complaint. Said complaint
was that the public subscribed £7072, and received back
only £1333 in prizes, whereas “Tattersall” gives back
£6300 in prizes out of £7000. If the Druids, when they
advertise their next “gala,” will st’te openly in their
advertisements and on their tickets that thev give back
on an average less than 4s. in the £, and that about 12s.
in the £, or whatever it may be, goes in expenses and
salaries to official boss Druids, then the public will under-
stand the situation, and will know what kind of game it
is playing. Even according to the above Druid’s own
showing, the expenses swallowed a lot more than half the
subscriptions, so the corltenlion that the gala exists in
great part to supply comfortable billets for various people
looks justifiable. “ Expenses ” don’t help on any cause ;
they only help on the people who get the expenses.—

A Yalgoo pub. (W.A.) is run by an Eng-
lish Viscount, and his bar-tender is the son of an
ex-Governor of Westralia.
The top-hat is much in evidence in the

IMITATION THE SINCEREST FLATTERY. A
MELBOURNE STREET SCENE.
One of the oldest and most bigotedly-bitter
adversaries of the drink-traffic in Australia draws
15 per cent, interest under a bill of sale over the
stock-in-trade of a city wine-cellar
Yic. Premier Turner gave up the bicycle
after a heroic attempt to conquer it. Unfor-
tunately, he tried to learn when suffering from a
severe cold, and every time he sneezed he fell off.
The scholarly C. H. Barton, who has, in
his day, edited both Maryborough (Q.) Chronicle
and Wide Bay News, has now seated his radical-
conservative self in the editorial chair of the local
Patriot !
Recent M.L. decease : Mrs. T. U. Cook,
wife of a well-known white settler. Mrs. Cook
(aged 81) was an aboriginal of high lineage—a
daughter of Te Horohau, of Otaki, the son of
Hapi, the great Arawa chief. She was also re-
lated to Te Rauparaha, of all-conquering fame, to
Thakara and to Kereopa. Cook, the relict, is 81.
Their family is a large one, and Bill Cook, a son,
is a printer.
Sylvanus Angus, the
patriarchal basso and oldest
member of Melbourne’s
Metropolitan Liedertafel,
died the other day without
getting the newspaper notice
that was fairly due to such
an ancient musical identity.
Angus’s reputation a a first-
class amateui singer dated
back to the Fifties, and had
prevented him, no doubt,
from developing into a capi-
talist. In his declining years
he still displayed the rem-
nants of a fine voice to the
best advantage, and the
shabbily - dressed old man
was a memorable feature of
many a smoke-concert. To
hear Angus—a thin, care-
worn, Moses-like figure, in
seedy coat and baggy trousers
—sing the solo, ‘ ‘ When Sor-
row Sleepeth,” to a hum-
ming accompaniment by the
Met. Liedertafel choir, was
to be impressed. The writer,
for one, will always think of
it- as a singularly effective
platform performance. The
sad song the venerable
warbler in the foreground—the melodious droning
of many voices from the rear. This was true
harmony.
Working in a Q. mine, in one gang, are a
once well-known police magistrate, a fully-degreed
solicitor, a bank manager, the son of a whilom
Supreme Court Judge, and a bank clerk. The
other men in the gang mostly spell cow with a k.
The remains of Miss Martin, sister of the
late N.S.W. Chief-Justice, were brought down
from Glen Innes last week and interred in the
family vault in the old R.C. cemetery at Parra-
matta. The father and mother of the dead C. J.
are in this vault, while his own dust lies in the
tomb of the Long family at Rand wick—the reason
of the separation in death being that “Jimmy
Martin did not die “friends” with the R.C.
church.
“Curly” Jones, M.L.A., goes to England
as honorary-secretary to Premier Reid during his
journey and his stay in London.
S.A. Acting-Judge Russell, who acts dur-

Supreme Court but a short while ago.
“If Mr. Stead was drowning, he would
refuse to be rescued by a man who had eloped
with another man’s wife.”— British Review.
The Earl of Yarmouth, the giddy-girly
ballet-man, has farewelled Mackay (Q.) with a
final pirouette, and proposes to take his heels back
to Hingland.
S.A. millionaire Elder’s estate will pro-
bably pan out much under the figure estimated by
the press. The deceased squatter is stated to have
made heavy losses in late years.
S. : “ What nonsense the
paragraphists get off about Pre-
mier Turner going back on his
Democratic habiliments since
receiving the Imperial brand!
I passed him in a Melb. street a
week or two ago. He wore a
creased grey sac-suit that had
evidently seen much service ; a
black boxer, certainly an old
friend ; and a tie that would
have sent O. Wilde into convul-
sions. Evidently George will
never deceive the world with
ornament, but, having lowered
himself to the ranks of the
K.C.M.G’s., he should adopt
the uniform.” All the same,
G.T. is reported from Ade-
laide to be sartorially as re-
splendent as all the other
K.C.M.G.’s, save in the matter
of “decorations.”
Whilst one of the Austra-
lias was in the middle of her
last election campaign the At-
torney-General was travelling
by train from the capital to
his constituency, accompanied
by his father and younger
brother. The compartment was
full, and the attentions of the
two relatives, who are inordi-
nately proud of their able kins-
man, were so marked that the
unfortunate Minister of the
Crown dared scarcely wink an
eyelid for fear of being made
ridiculous. At last, in an un-
guarded moment, he permitted
himself to raise his head and
rap out a terrific sneeze, but
scarcely had its echoes died
away before the aged progeni-
tor yelled hysterically, “ Shut
der vinder, Johnny, shut der
vinder; der Attorney-General
vill ketch cold.”
A syndicate proposes to purchase the

The N.S.W. Probate Court will shortly

Queensland lecturer Buchanan, who goes
to England for a year, has signed on as parson at
Chalmers Presbyterian Church, Sydney, when the
lecture-tour is over. The ex-lawyer looks as far
ahead as a star actor.
Editor Finlayson, of the S.A. Register,
leaves Adelaide for England April 26. As he is
now on speaking-terms with Premier Kingston
again, it will not matter even if they travel by
the same boat, although, a few months ago, Great
Britain would not have been big enough to hold
both of them.
IN THE NICEST POSSIBLE WAY .
“ Mother’s compliments, and will you come out begging with her
this morning? ”
Melb. : “ Saw Gillies to-day, first time
since his return. No longer the ripe pippin about
the gills, but cultivates a rather aristocratic pallor.
He has grown much like the faintly-remembered
Engineer-in-Chief, Tom Higinbotham, George’s
brother. ”
James Goldsburg, for many years driver
of the old mail-coach between Maitland and Wol-
lombi, and still a well-known identity of that dis-
trict, has inherited from a distant relative an ex-
tensive estate known as Tunrymo re, in the North
of Ireland.
W. B. Dailey, whose statue in Hyde Park
will be unveiled next week, enjoyed his first Minis-
terial office—that of Solicitor - General—just 88
days. Which impressed him so badly that it was
sixteen years before he let himself be again drawn
into a Ministry.
Premier Kingston’s latest law-partner—
A. J. M‘Lachlan—-is the third in three years.
Although but a junior, he made a brilliant defence
in the Mann murder-case, tried at Adelaide last
year. He is Liberal in politics, and will probably
be in Parliament ere long.
Premier Turner has comparatively seldom
appeared in court as a speaker. He did not feel
his feet in that regard until plunged into the
waves of legislation. Wherefore prophets are
declaring that he will go to the Bar and ripen into
a good, common-sense Judge.
Chaffey Baker gave a garden-party to the
members of the Federal Election, but he omitted
to ask the President. The S.A. delegation is
indeed a happy family. Neither Symon nor
Baker will speak to Kingston, while Howe makes
no secret of his hatred for Cockburn.
W. T. Carter, ex-M.P., of Williamstown,
Vic., who was recently busy on a flying-machine,
has invented a torpedo which appears to be the
most expert and docile engine of destruction at
present in the market. At a recent trial Carter
put his highly-trained torpedo through some
remarkable pacings. At order it dived, floated,
went full-speed-ahead, back-pedalled, ran in
circles, turned somersaults, and rushed at a punt
moored in the distance, butting it amidships with
astonishing precision. After which it returned
for further orders. Carter, who, as a lay-preacher
and a ranting Methodist, is naturally a man of
blood, really appears to have contrived an engjpe
which should be of vast assistance to Providence
in all future efforts to uphold the “ Hempire.”
London Humanitarian al-
leges that the British merchant-
service contains i u nbers of
sailor-women disguised as sailor-
men. One Marie Herve, by the
way, who had worked as a she-
male farm-hand for 60 years, was
not detected until admission to
the hospital of Dinan, France,
the other day, at the age of 72,
to be treated for partial blindness.
It was the compulsory entrance-
bath that found her out. In
Carlton, Melb., for this last 20
years has worked a woman bis
cuit-machme maker, who swings
the sledge at the anvil and makes
parts as well as any male smith.
In 1888, the late “Johnny”
Bray, of South Australia, was re-
commended for a K.C.M.G.-ship
which, to the disgust of Gov.
Robinson, he declined to take.
Bray talked freely of his refusal,
contemptuously declaring that he
had no use for such rubbish.
Later on, the Pimperialists
hooked their fish, and “Johnny ”
was bebaubled. “ How was it,”
enquired a Sydney man of
“ Johnny’s ” colleague, Playford,
“ that Bray let him self be branded
after all ? ” “ Ah,” said the pon-
derous Honest Tom (so nick-
named after a famous S.A.
draught stallion), “it was the
women did it. Do you think Mrs.
Bray was always going to walk
into the Governor’s drawing-room
behind Lady Downer ? ”
“Queen Victoria visited
London for the first time in two
years and after ‘ bolding a draw-
ing room ’ fled to Windsor from
the city so distasteful to her,”
writes The Bulletin’s London
correspondent. “She drove
through the thronged, carriage-
lined Hyde Park to the rattling
of nigger-slicers in the dish-cover
cuirasses, and the loud-sounding,
stony silence of the crowd. A
stunted, squat, old lady in dowdy
black, with clayish-grey hair, the
flush of indigestion on her face,
and nose particularly. She sat
in the open carriage looking ter-
ribly sulky, ignoring the hat-
liftings and bowings, and snap-
ping off bad-tempered comments
which her companions did not
appear to heed. Thus Victoria
Regina, 1897. God Save the
Queen ! The Empress Frederick
sat by the side of H.M., looking
matronly and queenly by com-
parison, and smiling complacently on all around.”
The proposed celebration of the jubilee of
Bishop Perry’s consecration in Melbourne in 1847
reminds one that Auckland, Hobart, and Bris-
bane, mere specks in those days, acquired bishops
of their own before Melbourne had thought the
matter out—some of them ten years before.

the prosperity of N.S.W. Perhaps, however, he

A correspondent from the North
After seven years’ absence from Brisbane (Q.), I saw a
white-haired, slender, ancient and venerable gentleman
hailing a tramcar there from the “wrong side” of the
street. The driver didn’t see or hear him, and whipped
past with horses at best trot. Like a practised sprinter,
the ancient slithered after, with coat-tails flying as the
ground disappeared behind ’em, caught the tram in a
flash, after shaving the noses of some ‘bus-horses olatter-
ing by t’other way, leaped, while full pelt, upon the car,
and steadied himself like a practised tram-guard. Then J
caught sight of his face fully. Heavens 1 It was the in-
destructible old Methuselah, Dr. K. I. O'Doherty, quon-
dam M.P. in Q. and of Ireland! . . . And, by the way,
Dr. O’Doherty is patentee of a new anti-decomposition
substance, invented by himself. (Probably used on him-
self 7)
Coroner Youl, of Melb., having been asked
to narrate his most surprising experience, replied,
thoughtfully, with the air of a man who does not
expect to be believed : “ I onoe held an inquest on
a man who hung himself, and who had sixteen
sovereigns in his pocket, and had just been
divorced from his wife.”
Some Federal delegates, who are always
printed as “ Honorable ” in their own provinces,
hardly knew their illustrious names when they
appeared in the Adelaide papers behind plain Mr.
Some of the Van Dobson Land delegates—nearly
every Tas. politician is more or less “Honorable
within the province ” —are said to religiously avoid
any but their own specially-imported newspapers
while in Adelaide.
Melb. Met. Board of Works is a consider-
ably Irish institution. Among the colleagues of
White Knight Fitz-Gibbon (who married Mickey
Dawson’s daughter, begorra!) there are commis-
sioners Cody, Dillon, Fogarty, Moloney, O’Con-
nor, Gahan, Hennessey, and M‘Mahon. With
nine or more Irishmen on the Board, it is not sur-
prising that the Board’s office building is rented
from Paddy M'Caughan.
Apropos R.C. hierarchy, Archbishop
Vaughan was the only N.S. Wales prelate who
had a layman—Mr. Makinson, a ’vert—for private
secretary. Archbishop Pokling had an Italian
cleric, the handsome and courtly Dr. Colletti,
and Cardinal Moran has an Irish priest, Dr.
O’Haran. Archbishop Vaughan had a great
antipathy to Italian priests, and shifted them out
of his way whenever he could.

Captain Robert Wilson says : “ About eighteen
months ago I had occasion to visit Sydney, and
while there was taken ill. I went to the best
doctors, but they could do nothing for me, and I
rapidly got worse and worse. I then came on to
Aew Caledonia and went into the hospital there.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The law of supply and demand. Although
Sydney market is glutted with wheat and flour,
bread is still 3d. a loaf as in the days of the dearth.
Speaker Abbott (N.S.W.) has now been
a ‘ half y ears in that position. The record
£ll j , Speakership was that of Arnold, who
“lied the post for 10 years—’6s to 75.
One of the indications of the gradual
glacier-sliding going on in q. politics just now is
that the weekly paper which formerly boomed
Premier Nelson is barracking for Tozer with all
its might.
u Why not call the Upper Federal House the
tt Senate ” and the Lower one the “Corrobboree?”
House of Representatives” and “States As-
sembly ” are long and cumbersome and altogether
meaningless.
Australian: “ For my part I don’t like to
see the National Convention so starchy, trim and
smug. There has been a sad lack of fire and the
convincing. The wheels have been whizzing like
the knives of a cbaff-cutter, with no compressed
hay to out.”
Tas. Premier Braddon at the Convention
praised the Tas. franchise as sufficiently liberal
and remarked that one man might have as many
as twelve votes. “ Ah,” interjected Reid, “ that
is liberal enough.” Then Peacock, and all bar
Braddon, yelled.
The Vic. Old-Age Pensions Committee is
slumberously getting into harness. A State-con-
trolled system of all-round pensions is not in-
tended, but the “ more urgent ” cases of pauperism
may, the commissioners think, be fixed ud at a
cost of .£lOO,OOO.
Almost every day since the Convention
began its sittings it has been bombarded with
petitions that it shall “recognise God” in the
new j Constitution. If some arrangement could be
made for God recognising the Convention it would
be a great deal more to the point. The Almighty
will get on quite as well without the Convention
recognising Him, but if He doesn’t recognise the
Convention it is liable to be stepped on and flat-
tened out at any moment.
Wanliss, M.L.C., of
Ballarat, is about to pe-
tition Her Gracious about
the use of the word
“ England ” as a syno-
nym for Great Britain,
to the scandal of Welsh,
Irish, and Scotch “ sub-
jects. ”
Holder’s contention
that an Autralian Act-
ing - Governorship is not
a royal appointment—a
contention objected to
by his fellow-members—
would seem, if examined,
to be strictly sound, at
all events since Chief-
Justices by right of office
assume the position. The
Government which makes
the Chief Justice makes
thereby the Acting-Go-
vernor, and, as it can
theoretically dismiss a
Chief-Justice, it there-
fore possesses the same
power over an Acting-
Governor
It seems to be agreed
so far that the Lower
House of the Federal
Parliament is to be called
the House of Representa-
tives and the other the
States Assembly. Both
names are long and
clumsy, and the idea of
calling the Upper House
the “Assembly,” which
name has hitherto been
always used for the popu-
lar Chamber, makes con-
fusion. Why not simply
call them the Federal
Assembly and the Fede-
ral Senate ? Then a man
would be a senator instead
of an M.S.A., and the
prospective dreary joke
about these three letters
meaning that things were Muddled So Awfully
would be strangled in its infancy.
Lyne told the smaller states at Adelaide
that if N.S.W. and Vic. decided to federate, the
“ little ” provinces would have to come in. Which
was characterised by Gordon as “injudicious and
harmless bounce.” • -
Only three territories accepted the U.S.
Constitution Act when it came from its framers’
hands. The others held back or denounced it.
.Now, close on 50 states shelter under it. Why
should not N.S.W., Victoria, and S. Australia
make a beginning ?
Two prominent members of the Federal
Convention are Jews. Therefore the question
arises : Suppose the Convention decides to “ re-
cogm.se Cod,” as the soi-disant Christian parsoni-
cal crowd loves to phrase it, what arrangements
are to be made for recognising Abraham ?
Convention Delegate Dobson, ex-Premier
of Tasmania, would restrict the franchise for the
xederal Senate to persons over 25 years of age
who have sown their wild oats, and have left off
gomg to the theatres, and who have begun to read
the papers. ’ The Hobart papers, presumably.
When Dibbs went to England and left
Barton as his deputy, Premier Reid declared
that there could be no such functionary as an
Acting-Premier he was wholly unconstitutional
and impossible and non-existent. The proposed
appointment of Brunker as Acting-Premier dur-
mg Reid s absence in England on grovel now
looks a trifle awkward.
The way in which the Federation politicians
stick up, each for his own province, as if its
boundaries were eternally delimited, reminds
one of how a back-century pope divided the whole
unknown globe, by the aid of a holy ruler, it may
be supposed, and a sanctified pencil, between
bpain and Portugal. What are Spain and Portu-
gal now m the “general proportion? ”
The A.N.A. in Vic. is smiled upon by the
“•p 1 Church, because it has no secret ritual, etc.
hence a certain dominant tone therein (remarks
a Bulletin correspondent). The “ Tammany ”
metropolitan committee is run by a compact
band of smart young men. It is a beautiful thing
to attend a “ Tammany ” meeting, and watch the
majority voting like clockwork, while a few
oppositionists look on gasping.
“Toby” Barton’s denunciation of the
Referendum as a relic of ancient barbarism handed
down from the cave-dwellers staggered the Con-
wasn’t prepared for such aggrava
ted Toryism. It was a Referendum vote, by the
way, which appointed Barton to his present posi-
tion by the biggest suffrage in Australia, so, by his
own showing, “ Toby ” is now the boss barbarian
and principal elective troglodyte of this country.
The word “ Christian ” serves a lot of
purposes, as witness some recent cablegrams from
Crete :
A horrible massacre of Moslems has occurred at Deph-
nes, where 160 took refuge in a mosque where they were
afterwards burnt alive by the Christians.
Twenty Moslem women sought refuge in a cave at
uephnes, and the Christian mob endeavored to suffocate
them by setting Are to paraffin.
A “ Christian,” in the latter-day sense of the term,
is evidently a person who is known by the com
busted Mahommedan he leaves in his wake.
BIKEY HUMOB.
RUDE BOY (to old Mr. Johnson, who has bought a toy bicycle for his
grandson) : “ Hey, mister, have yer had a spill?”
Farmer Copley, the derelict leader of S.A.
Opposition, will be 52 on April 25. A 30-year old
scandal concerning him was resurrected" in the
Council by a political opponent last year, and he
has never been able to regain the prestige then
lost. It is hard on a middle-aged public man that
the escapades of his boyhood should be revived -to
damn him, but the other side had been so busy
with Premier Kingston’s social reputation that
poor Copley was pilloried in sheer revenge, al-
though for more than a quarter of a century he
has lived a blameless private life. Altogether, he
is better than most of the men on his side, although
he is a renegade in politics, for he began his par-
liamentary career in 1884 as a stalwart Liberal
and a true friend of the producer.
No recognition of Gaud wanted in the
Australian Federal Constitution.
The British House of Commons has passed
the second reading of a bill to establish a criminal
court of appeal. The miserable “mother country”
ahead again !
C. H. Buzacott, the
somewhat various Q.

narrates that when a
paper failed to reach its
destination three times,
he placed the local post-
master on the free-list.
ANIMAL TEACHES ANIMAL.
“The association styled ‘ the National League ” held its annual
meeting at 274.Collins-st., Melbourne, last week. Mr. F. Madden,
M.L.A., said that the farmer was ‘a slow-going animal,” and made
references to breeches-pockets. Suggestions were made that lec-
tures should be given in the suburbs. Then someone interposed
with an interjection that the country should be ‘ educated ’ in the
belief that the capitalist was ‘the farmer’s best friend, not his
enemy.’”— Daily News Item.
Dear Bulletin, — You say that Turner and
Duffy will leave Vic. Ministry, and that Attorney-
General Isaacs will become Premier. More likely
that Isaacs will be on the Supreme Court Bench
ere the year is out. Hasn't Justice Williams al-
ready announced that he contemplates retiring on
his pension and taking up his abode in England?
The resignation would probably be tendered
straight away if his Honor could find a cash
buyer now for his fine suburban mansion and
grounds.—B.
“Native ” to The Bulletin :
Why disgrace the wattle by referring belligerent
Irishers to its blended green and gold ? Besides, the
wattle doesn’t bloom at the right time of the year. On
St. Patrick’s Day the most glorious combination of the
colors is found in the autumnal foliage of the willows,
poplars, and other imported trees and shrubs which im-
ported men have planted with their hideous old feuds in
Australasia. But, short of planting the chief actors,
nothing will cure the trouble. Meantime, despite the
jeers of Australians, the green and yellow factionists will
continue to act the variegated goat.
The Governor-General of Australia’s salary
is likely to stay fixed at £lO,OOO. Two State
Governors, Barkly and Hotham, have received
<£15,000 a year. Victorian Governors until lately
drew <£lo,ooo a year. Acting-Governor Darley,
in the interregnum between Gov. Duff’s death and
the sailing of Gov. Hampden from England was
paid at the rate (for the two offices) of <£10,500 per
annum, and from the time Gov. Hampden sailed
till he was sworn in, at the rate of £7OOO per
annum. These are the highest salaries Austral-
asia has paid under that head.
So far as things have gone the Federal
Constitution steers clear of one very bad rock on
which the United States struck. It provides
that the Constitution may be amended by a vote
of both Houses endorsed by the referendum. In
the States an amendment has to be agreed to by
a two-thirds vote of both Houses of Congress
and by three - fourths of the State Legisla-
tures, consequently no anomaly, however bad” can
be remedied if it is to the interest of a few tin-pot
States to prevent it. The U.S. Constitution-
makers started with the idea that their Constitu-
tion was practically perfect, and laid themselves
out to make alterations as nearly impossible as
might be, and their descendants have been more
or less sorry for it ever since.
. Q. Premier Nelson’s boast to an Adelaide
press-interviewer that the little brown men of
Japan cannot be imported into Leperland without
the shipper giving a 10,000 dollar guarantee that
they shall not become a burden on the Q. Govern-
ment, is little eo the point. A 1,000,000 dollar
guarantee wouldn’t matter. The question is a
wages one. The cheap Asiatic coolie, of whatever
territory, knocks over the white man’s chances
steals his necessaries of life, distils misery into his
existence, fattens only the already fat, and emaci-
ates the already lean, brings hell and hatred into
the ordinary relationship between employer and
employe, and makes men dream murder and
firestick by night and by day. The cheap and
nasty nigger and brownie, and yellowie, must be
walled out of Federated Australia.
Hardly a month passes without a case of
remission of sentence by the Vic. Governor-in-
Council. Sometimes, too, as in the Staples case
under circumstances unjustifiable and disgraceful’
Once more The Bulletin maintains that every
case of the kind should be publicly notified in the
Government Gazette.
Melh. : “I have just
had occasion to go to the
house of a democratic legis-
lator, and it is melancholy.
He receives visitors with a
kind of state—a state of litter
—in his dingy front room,
amid a dusty rubbish of Han-
sards, newspapers, pam-
phlets, and what not. Hig
wife and family look to ms
not far removed from squalor.
Altogether anunkemptnome.
It don’t pay. It is a reign
of terror—lest the member
should be sacked, as help-
lass as a dismissed police-
man. ”
“We have great advan-
tages over our opponents,”
says Westralian Premier For-
rest, in connection with the
alleged election campaign
(for three - fourths of the
people are disfranchised).
"We have a record behind
us.” Rather. Other things
too. The railways, tele-
graph-wires, and post-offices.
Forrest’s dreary waste of
jumbled sentences, by cour-
tesy called a speech, contain-
ing nearly 22,000 words, was
(writes a Bulletin corres-
pondent) first telegraphed
from Bunbury free of cost
and then distributed by post
and rail all over the pro-
vince, for there, as in N.S.
Wales, the Government pro-
tects the newspapers by
free-postage. Not satisfied
with this, the country lias
to pay for a supplement re-
print with Forrest’s correc-
tions. Issue something like
15,000. Three clerks in the
Premier’s department have
ever since been engaged fold-
ing and enveloping these sup-
plements in Govt, stationery
for transmission, at the coun-
try’s expense, through the
post to every butcher, baker,
and candlestick-maker whose
name appears on the Wes-
tralian directory.
Significant that Q. Home Sec. Tozer should
say that, “by July, whatever party is in power”
would bijing in a Federal Enabling Bill. “ What-
ever party is in power ! ” A sli-p of the tongue, a
sly hint, or a mere Tozerism ?
As one very natural result of leaving the
railways under provincial control, S.A. kicks
violently against Federal postal and telegraph
management. It wants to know why it should
lump its profitable postal system with the utterly
bankrupt ones of N.S.W. and Tasmania, if N.S.W.
won’t combine its small railway deficit with S.A.’g
large one.


Homely illustration of the superiority of
union over federation offered by a parson at” the
recent Melb. Wesleyan conference :
You talk of federation instead of union. Well, suppose
a young man had been engaged for 25 years, and said to
the young lady, “ I love you, but I’m too poor to marry
you—we’ll federate.”
The assembled parsons were mightily pleased with
this, of course—the cloth likes a joke if it is
sufficiently Biblical.
“ TASSY ” SCORES ONE !
We nave just received the following Marra
Creek, Brewarrina, N.S.W., 24th March, 1897.
To the Tasmanian Eucalyptus Oil Co., Hobart.
Dear Sirs, Enclosed please find a postal note for
•I s Will you kindly forward me a bottle
of your “Platypus” Eucalyptus Oil. It will,
doubtless, seem curious to you that I should send
over 1150 miles for this, but, as far as my observa-
tion goes, the art of making this commodity pro-
perly has not reached this colony. The stuff which
I have used and met with here, and which goes by
the name of eucalyptus, I can only describe by
the one word, ‘rubbish.’ Having frequently used
yours and knowing its value is my reason for send-
ing this order to you. Yours truly, .”
‘Platypus Eucalyptus Oil, which our customer
refers to, is to be had in Sydney of all chemists,
but purchasers should only buy original bottles
with our trade-mark (a platypus) on the labels.
Messrs. Elliott Bros., Ltd., of O’Connell-street,
Sydney, are the wholesale agents. The Tasmanian
Eucalyptus Oil Company, Limited, Hobart and
London. #
The record Victorian bullock to date was a
beast bred by Mr. Power near Maffra, Gippsland
—Bft. high at shoulder ; weight, 29|cwt.—some 12
years ago. Paul de Castella, of Yering, obtained,
when John Sayle was his manager, the highest
price recorded to date for a mob of fats—9o head
bringing an average of =£29 10s., after having been
bought six months before for =£4 ss. a head. But,
then, that was in the roaring days of ’54.
Mr. Charles Oertel, of Sydney, manu-
factures a “ raspberry-juice syrup”—obviously
prepared (as per analyst’s certificate) from pure
fruit without chemical aid. Being the only such
article pushed in the market it should have a
great and immediate success.*
March 22 was the 49th anniversary of
Scotch settlement in Otago, M.L. The first ship
to arrive was the John Wickliffe, which brought
el «’#J ants ’ ' nc hiding Capt. Cargill, nicknamed
the Moses ”of the settlement. Another ship
set out a day before the John Wickliffe, but
voyaged so slowly that pioneer meenister Burns
was prevented from being present to open the ter-
ritory-grab with prayer.
The case of two men who were charged at
a Melb. court, a while ago, with trespassing on
somebody’s back verandah in the middle of the
night, and who explained that they had come to
steal apples from the apple-treeless garden, has
borne fruit already. The other day, another two
men, surprised in a stable-loft at East Melbourne,
made the excuse that they were looking for grapes.
A GRAND LITERARY INSTITUTION.
Cole s Book Arcade now runs from the centre
of the block in Bourke-street to the centre of the
block in Collins-street, Melb., a distance of GfiOft.,
and contains the following 17 departments, mostly
literary and artistic : 1, New Books; 2, Second-
hand Books ; 3, Stationery ; 4, Music ; 5, Fancy
Goods ; 6, Toys ; 7, Perfumery; 8, Pictures ; 9,
Artists Materials ; 10, an Ornamental Exhibition;
11, a Japanese Exhibition ; 12, a Wonderland ;
13, a Smiling Gallery; 14, a Child’s Picture
Gallery ; 15, a Bargain Room ; 16, a Tea Room ;
17, a splendidly arranged new Wholesale Book
Department, containing half-a-million books. The
mam walks of the establishment are half-a-mile
long. *
The bosses of a Presbyterian church at
Clifton Hill, Vic., wanting a clergyman, offered
a week, the devil-dodger to find his own manse
and pay all his own expenses. It was mentioned
as an inducement to ambitious “ meenisters ” that
there “is not a single pawnshop in the whole
neighbourhood.” Very foolish this —at such a
wage the poor parson would often need to spout
the family Bible.

In the Zulu War.
A STORY OF BUSH AND BATTLE.
THE TALE OF AN OLD CAMPAIGNER.
BESIEGED IN A MISSION EKOWE—
FEEDING ON WEEVIL* AND OXEN
-ON THE VERGE OF A GRUESOME
GRAVE.
He was a bronzed and bearded soldier—an old
warrior of the Zulu campaign—and had much of
interest to tell.
His name is Mr. R. Groves, of Hyde Park,
Rook wood, and the representative of the Star
found him one morning in his well-kept orchard,
spending the evening of a stirring life amidst his
fruit trees, reading his paper in the coolness of a
shady porch, that, covered with blossoming bou-
gainvillea, rose as a splendid splash of purple and
green in contrast to the brilliant sepia of pounded
'clay around.
I’M FIFTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE,”
he said, making room for us beside him, “ and
when I left my regiment, the 3rd Buffs, I held the
rank of quartermaster-sergeant.”
“ And the Zulu campaign ? ”
“Ah, yes! I was through that,” he replied,
shaking his head at the recollection. “ The cam-
paign of ’79. Yes, that’s what knocked me up.”
1 ‘ How was that ? ”
“Well, you see, our column was in six detach-
ments, and Cetewayo’s impis
MASSACRED FIVE OF THEM.
Ours was the sixth, and we made for a deserted
mission station ekowe, and kept the dusky troops
at bay. They couldn’t carry our building, and we
held out till help arrived.”
“ You must have had an awful time? ”
“Awful! My God, it was. We were herded
together there for 13 weeks without ever being
able to get a proper sleep. We had no bedding,
and the air was filled with heat and stench. The
only food saved was weevily biscuits, and then we
had to kill the half starved trek oxen to help keep
life together. Should ever we dare to show our-
selves for a minute to snatch a breath of air
AN ASSEGAI WOULD WHIRL
THROUGH SPACE,
and the man was dead that it struck.”
“ Did this conclude your perils ? ”
“ No, not by a long way. For fourteen months
we had nothing to sleep upon, and had to lie down
in the open air—in the dry heat and the cold,
pouring rain—it was all the same. Fever and
sickness carried off many of the men, and when
our tattered remnant reached the coast I left the
regiment, having served my time.”
“ What effect had the campaign upon you ? ”
“A terrible effect, that till last Christmas I was
never without. As a result of the exposure and
starvation I found my digestion ruined. For
seventeen years I’ve had twitching pains under
the shoulders and in the arms ; the nerves of my
arms were weak, and caused me agony whenever I
moved them. I suffered from cramps, and at
times
A DEATHLY NUMBNESS PERVADED
MY BODY.”
“ How about the doctors ? ”
“Ah ! well, I tried them,” he replied in a tone
tinged with contempt, “ and they never did me
any good. Some said it was one thing and some
another ; others just said it was general weakness,
and couldn’t or wouldn’t state what they meant.”
“ So you never progressed ? ”
“No, not a bit. I gradually got worse, and, of
course, I lost interest in everything. I could never
walk far, I never slept properly, and I hardly ever
ate anything except dry toast and tea. I was
miserable and restless, and always in pain.”
“ How long did this last ? ”
“ Till last December. Several people who saw
how bad I looked said they thought
I WAS GOING TO DIE.
And I felt just like it, and a doctor I consulted
told me the same thing. I was in a state of col-
lapse then. Even ordinary conversation would
take all my breath away, and I’d sink back ex-
hausted on the sofa. A lady doctor told me it
was all through my digestive organs, and that’s
what it was. ”
“ Well, what did you try next? ”
“ That’s the point. I picked up a pamphlet one
day in December thjit a man had thrown into the
house. It was an advertisement for Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills for Pale People, and I there read a case
just like my own that had been cured.”
“ What did you do ? ”
“ Why, the only sensible thing. I got some of
the pills.”
“ Did you try ’em ? ”
“ I should think I did.”
“Well, you don’t seem very dead now,” we
commented, looking at the grey-bearded face and
sturdy military figure of our friend.
“ No, and
I DON’T FEEL VERY DEAD
either, young man. I feel very much alive. Why,
do you know,” he said impressively, “that I’ve
increased twelve pounds in weight since I took
those pills of Dr. Williams’.”
“ Have you ? ”
“Yes, I have. I improved gradually from the
first dose. First, I took a pill at a time, and later
on increased the dose, lip to now I’ve taken
about thirteen boxes, and I feel so well that [
intend to discontinue them altogether. As it is,
I haven’t had any for over a week, and I feel first-
class. ”
“ Have you a good appetite now ? ”
“Rather,” he laughed out. “ I’m always ready
for my meals now,
AND SLEEP LIKE A TOP.
And when I wake up I feel like a man instead of
the weary wreck that I was three months ago.”
“ How about the pains ? ”
“Oh ! they’ve all left me. I haven’t felt them
at all for a couple of months.”
“ I suppose you walk better now? ”
“ Yes. Before I took Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
I’d have to rest two or three times just walking
into Rookwood. Now Igo straight in at a good
pace, and only yesterday I carried parcels home—
a thing that I couldn’t have possibly done before,”
and the old soldier’s eyes twinkled at the humor
of the idea. “ I had to knock my cold baths off,
too,” he said, “ because I was getting so weak, but
now I take ’em regular every morning. My
digestive organs are in perfect order, and all the
functions of my body do their duty.”
“And I’m only doing mine,” he added, “in
telling you this.”
“ Do you feel as well as you did before the war?”
“Yes. I honestly feel better to-day
THAN I DID TWENTY YEARS AGO,
and that’s saying a good deal, as I’m getting an
old man now.”
“You firmly believe in Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills, then?”
“ Believe in the pills ?” he queried. “ I should
think I do. They’ve done a hundred times more
for me than all the doctors and medicines I’ve seen
and taken for nigh on eighteen years. That’s
saying a good lot, but it’s true. Believe in the
pills ? I should think I did.”
Then we shook hands with this gay old veteran
and bade him “ Good-bye,” and wished him a long
and happy life.
As we went up the garden walk, “I say,” he
called after us, “ look at this.” We turned round,
and found him vigorously going through a number
of army extension movements with his arms.
Then he held his legs straight, and bending his
body touched the ground easily with either hand.
“ I couldn’t do that before,” he said.
We closed the gate and left him there amidst
his fruit trees and his blossoming vines.
It is not only in cases like those described above,
however, that Dr. Williams’ Pills are so valuable.
They have cured paralysis, locomotor ataxy, rheu-
matism, and sciatica; also all diseases arising from
impoverishment of the blood, scrofula, rickets,
chronic erysipelas, consumption of the bowels and
lungs, anaemia, pale and sallow complexion,
general muscular weakness, loss of appetite,
influenza’s evil after effects, palpitations, pains in
the back, nervous headache, early decay, all forms
of female weakness, and hysteria. These pills are
a tonic, not a purgative. They are genuine only
with the full name, Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for
Pale People, and are sold by chemists and store-
keepers generally or the Dr. Williams Medicine
Coy., Queen’s Place, Sydney, will forward on
receipt of stamps or post order one box for 2s 9d,
or half-dozen for 14s 9d.*

SPORTING NOTIONS.
If Newhaven be as brilliant, or nearly as bril-
liant, a horse as Carbine of old, he could (in the present
writer’s opinion) have won the Sydney Cup, given good
condition and fair luck. Three-vear-old Carbine, with
9st. up, carried off the race in 1889, from Melos and
Abercorn, and must have had a lot of weight in hand to
enable him to do the trick. Carbine was giving 121 b. to
Melos, who appeared to be winning easily until Donald
Wallace’s champion, getting a clear run, came along like
a steam-engine and snatched the prize. At present,
when there is no Melos among the second rank of three-
year-olds, or Abercorn among the older ones, the 9st. 51b.
allotted, to Newhaven is certainly not a “crushing
weight.” “ Crushing ”is a comparative term, considering
that the best “ form ” of one season may be 2st. better or
worse than another’s. Judged by the 151 b. plus a
ten lengths’ beating, which Newhaven gave to Resolute
in last Melb. Cup race, the mighty chestnut was positively
“thrown into” the handicap at Randwick. Now that
absentee Cooper has chosen to scratch Newhaven, the
most likely of the three-year-olds is Reka, and he or
Damien (thinks the present writer) should win Sydney
Cup. There isn’t much merit to be discovered in Reka's
past performances, but one has to allow for special proba-
bility of improvement in the half-brother to Portsea.
Anyway, on the Melb. Cup running, Reka—who finished
fifth—is more favorably handicapped than Coil, Damien,
or even Resolute.
• * » *
Punters will do well to be doubtful about New-
haven for his first race at Randwick until they have seen
him take his preliminary canter. There are two New-
havens—the ridiculously easy Derby winner, and the
animal that has been twice disgraced by The Officer. The
Newhaven that begins to sweat before reaching the post
is the wrong ’un.
* * * »
Victor : To-day (Sat.) the A. J.C. Autumn meet-
ing begins at Randwick. The St. Leger looks a gift for
Newhaven, whose only dangerous opponent seems to be
the much-improved Carbine colt, Charge. O.P. or Irish
Stew may win the Hurdles, whilst Delaware and Vivian,
in the probable absence of Newhaven, should battle for
victory in the Autumn Stakes. The valuable Doncaster
Handicap will bring out a good field of “ triers.” If
Vanitas be reserved for the Cup—a probable contingency
—Adoration, CrSme d’Or, Precaution, Pilatus, and Dal-
meny read like a quintet from which the winner may
spring. Adoration’s win at Hawkesbury meeting last
Saturday was full of merit, and “on paper” she looks a
good thing. Danger is to be feared from the lightly-
weighted Pilatus, who ran two good races at Flemington
(Vic.) a fortnight ago, in one of which he showed well
against the sprinting wonder, Key.
* * * *
The champion two-year-old, Aurum, should
comfortably win the Champagne Stakes on Monday ; and
even if opposed by Newhaven in the All-Aged Stakes
he should be returned winner of that race also.
• * * *
The most noticeable feature in the Hawkesbury
club’s day’s racing last Saturday was the defeat of the hot
favorite, Hopscotch, in the big handicap. The “ sensa-
tional ” gelding will have to show the now common
miraculous “improvement” if he is to be returned a
winner at Randwick next week. Mr. S. Hordern won
two races with Adoration (Nordenfeldt-Idolatry) and
Maldon (Nordenfeldt-Idolatry) both popular fancies.
• * * •
With the exception of Newhaven, all the best
three-year-olds will compete in Sydney Cup next Mon-
day. The Officer, Coil, Charge and Reka read best of
this class, whilst of the older horses Vivian, Battalion,
Hopscotch and The Meddler look most formidable. Good
three-year-olds invariably run well in this race, and if
Charge can beat Coil he should win. The best outsider is
that beautifully-bred mare The Meddler (Trenton-Busy-
body) nicely treated with 7st. 81b.

Last year’s trotting-stallion prize at Sydney
Agricultural Show was annexed by a pacer. In America,
the home of the trotter, the gaits are held distinct, and if
the Sydney Agricultural Show people decide to allow the
two to compete, the competition should be advertised for
“ trotters and pacers.” To style the trotting exhibitions
for “speed, style, and action” is a farce, seeing that the
ring round which they are tried for “speed” is a bit
bigger than a good-sized soup-plate. Handsome little
pacer Tuxedo moved round in taking style last year, but
the owners of such majestic animals as Era and poor old
Tommy, since deceased, were not mad enough to allow
their valuable sires to climb all over themselves round the
good-sized soup-plate aforesaid. The competition should
be for “ conformation, action, and breeding.”
Considering that the V.R.C. has been liberally
charged with indifference to the welfare of deadheads, it
seems only fair to quote from a punter’s wail (in Melb.
’Erald) re the accommodation at small race-meetings :
“ It is scarcely credible, but nevertheless a fact, that any
person visiting the flat at Flemington is treated with
more courtesy than the persons who pay 2s. 6d. at
suburban registered courses. There (Flemington) they
can see the names of the riders, the sanitary arrangements
are not disgraceful, and in every other way their con-
dition is preferable.” That’s rather “up against” the
grumbling flatite, who wants a grand-stand gratis from
which to pass unfavorable remarks on the Melb. Cup.
• * * »
Tremolo, who ran third in the Steeplechase at
Flemington the other day, is a regular giant in appear-
ance, as he touches the standard at 18 hands —perhaps
the highest animal at the game in the world.

At last El wick (Tas.) meeting, a wordy conflict
took place between the urbane clerk of the tote and an
excited person who had been celebrating a win, and now
came to draw “ the stuff.” By a pardonable mistake,
considering the circumstances, he went to the wrong
window—the receiving teller’s, as it were, instead of the
paying ditto. Here the courtly politeness of the clerk
only served to add fuel to his wrath, and after much
unseemly wrangling he expressed his intention of coming
inside and punching the face of the ever-urbane.
Answered the suave clerk : “ Pray don’t trouble yourself;
if it is any convenience to you I will put it outside for
you.”
Dear Bulletin,—A stickler for the well of
Maori pure and undefiled, the official spelling of the
name of M‘Sweeney’s Clarendon Handicap winner jars on
me. There is not such a word in the language as
“ Waihine”—“ wahine ” (meaning wife) being the ap-
parent intention. “ Hine ” is the Maori radix of
femininity, hence Ohine, a maiden ; Ohinetapu, the sacred
maid ; Ohineroa, the stately maid, and Ohinemure, “ the
girl I left behind me.”—Yours, Timi.

In Tasmania recently a horse bolted with a
little girl barely in her teens, galloped some miles, cleared
a sft. railway-gate like a bird, and stood trembling
in front of the second facing it on the other side of the
rails. The child hung on like a postage-stamp, and her
name was—of all names—Corrigan.
Tha editor of London Referee, noticing Dai-
mio s failure (thus far) in England, suggests a reason for
Ebor’s present superiority to the other Australian ’chaser.
“ I do not maintain that Daimio necessarily must be a
nailer here, because he was educated for a business very
different from ours. I only say this is a horse who has
proved that he would have made a great mark put to any
jumping game you like. Whether he can be taught to
forget much that he learned ‘ down under,’ and adapt
himself to the altered conditions we offer, is another ques-
tion. The horse that can get over Flemington course can
be made to jump anything if apprenticed to that sort of
business. But now we have a journeyman, so to speak—
one who has served his time and become a master man.
For years he has been doing things in one way. To effect
them in different fashion a lot has to be unlearned, and
maybe he dees not make the new start quite on such
good terms as the likely novice.” Ebor was a likely
novice at “crosscountry” racing in England, and he has
taken kindly to the new business. Daimio never proved
himself a fast horse over a jumping course—not in the
Redleap sense of the term—and it now seems probable
that an Australian jumper must be trained to fly over the
small sticks, as Raleigh he is to cut a great figure
as an English steeplechaser in his middle-age.

A lady bookie blossomed forth at a Danevirke
(M.L.) meeting recently, and did good biz. Further
north, a gaudy silk-and-satin Maori dame tried the game,
made £5 on the day, and got taken down for the lot later
by a spieler, while learning the intricacies of the classic
three-card trick.

All the Australian daily papers bristle with ex-
pensive cables to the effect that one Bevan got second
place for high-jumping at certain university sports in
England. Ye gods ! But then this particular Bevan is
son of good old wax-dolly pastor Bevan, and it is probably
considered sufficiently astonishing to find a parson’s son
willing to take the trouble to jump.

Latest advices say that Stoddart’s team for
Australia next season will include Ranjitsinhji, F. S.
Jackson, Capt. Wynyard, M'Laren, Mason, Lilley, Hay-
ward, Hayman, Richardson, Peel, Bray (as second wicket-
keeper), and possibly Lohmann. All these batsmen are
noted for their dashing play, while on paper the team is
decidedly better than the last visiting XI. Ranji. has at
last definitely decided to make the voyage, a fact which
will delight all Australian cricket enthusiasts.

Lacrosse promises to hit football still harder in
Adelaide this season. The former game is being taken up

as against about 12 in ’96, and already the Adelaide Oval
authorities are nibbling at lacrosse fixtures.

Rockhampton turned out, the other day, to wit-

played with the left hand and the orthodox pick-handle
bat; the ladies had the use of right hands, skirts, feet,

sides, the horrid men won by four runs. As a dress-
makers’ parade, the show was very passable—and the
Lady Norman hospital will benefit to the extent of £l2O.

Last Saturday’s bike meeting at St. Kilda
C.C. ground gave the club further encouragement to im-
prove its accommodation for sightseers and become the
Flemington of wheel-racing. Given a fine afternoon and
a lively programme, the multitude will always roll up to
the St. Kilda track. This time the attraction of Bilmartin
was guaranteed by the management, and an advertise-
ment to that effect probably accounted for 20 per cent, of
the biggest crowd ever seen in Melbourne at a show which
had no pretentious “championship” or big handicap
item on the bill.
Divine William, without a doubt, is the centre
of human interest in Australian bike sport. Exagge-
rated stories re Bill’s ailment and the consequent
agony he endures whilst occupying that small saddle
whereon it pleaseth Providence to place him, have
raised the Plugger in public estimation. Thb Bulletin is
even disposed to pay him the tribute of a silent tear. On
Saturday the indomitable artist rode four races, cover-
ing ten miles in all, with no richer result than a third
prize of 3 sovs. But if he didn’t actually get there he was
in each case thereabouts. Although beaten, Bill was not
disgraced, and small boys took chewing-gum from their
mouths in order to express appreciation of his exertions.
When will Australia have a native-born biker
of the plump and trustworthy kind—like Martin and
Porta ? The least uncertain of the natives seems to be
Walne (he rode with a lovely black eye on Saturday), who
beat Megson in one-mile and five-mile scratch races, and
was himself beaten by Porta over the shorter distance.
Should Walne ever quite get to the top of the tree he will
stay there a while, as Martin did. Megson is no sooner a
champion than somebody takes his number down, where-
fore Joe has no worshippers outside of Sydney. The
Melbourne public can’t take his flashes of supremacy
seriously, seeing that he ranks as a non-local man. They
have not yet recovered from the awful collapse of Parsons,
whom they took very seriously last year, despite the palp-
able fact that he never was supreme at any point of the
game.
Kellow’s persistent failure in scratch races
doesn’t harmonise with the handicapped form of that
fair-haired young man. At last Austral meeting Kellow
appeared to have a more effective kick than Walne, but
since then the Northerner has been much the faster man
in classic events. For which matter, Kellow’s brilliant
Austral victory, or rather the utter defeat of the front-
mark men on that occasion, begins to look like a fluke.
Bilmartin was blocked, clearly enough, in the
final of the Open Handicap, but his protest was rather
absurd, considering that Prowse and others got blocked
likewise. Anyway, the old, original Bill would not have
let himself be “pocketed” among a crowd of second-
raters after catching his field a mile from home. Martin
at his best would have rushed to the front somehow, and
spread-eagled them before the bell rang. As it was, he
couldn’t even push himself into a place.
J. M‘lnnes races under the immediate super-
vision of a stern parent, who gives the lad his shove-off.
MTnnes, junior, white-faced and anxious, would probably
do better as a rule if the “ old man” were not present.
The system of engaging a competitor to make
pace in the mile scratch race—the pacer of the fastest
heat to have a chance in the final—works very well. The
fastest go on Saturday was the fifth heat (‘2min. 15sec.),
the slowest taking only ssec. more.
Multicycle races give the handicappers a chance
to make some absurd blunders. At St. Kilda, on Satur-
day, a moderate triplet, starting from the 120yds. mark,
made a holy show of the tandems, that had to give them
ground, and eventually won easily from two pairs of light-
weights. When the limit-men go hard all the way, it will
need a precious smart tandem to win from scratch, seem-
ingly. Relph and Walne captured the League’s tandem
race on the previous Saturday, simply because the long-
start men took things too easily at the outset.
* * * »
Though a programme immeasurably inferior to
that of the League was presented, the one day St. Kilda
meeting netted £l3o—while the governing body with two
days and two nights on the Exhibition Oval was able bo
scrape together a profit of only £7O more. The public
patronises the best track.
A glaring breach of the rules was committed
when Beeson swung out young M'lnnes as the lad was
passing him 100 yards from home. M‘lnnes swerved and
almost touched the fence, taking others with him and
sickening the spectators with the prospect of a tragedy.
For this error of judgment Beeson, who won, was relieved
of the trouble of taking the £l2, L. Barker, who finished
second, being awarded the prize.
Farrell, the boy who ran into third place in the
Open Handicap, is classed as third-rate, but his sprints
even now can live with the best of them. He is a mere
hoy, but thick-set, and evidently could stand a lot of
training. If he gets into the way of following the early
pace of a race Farrell’s class should narrow very quickly.
Tebbutt has contracted influenza, and will race
no more this season.
Walne, who has the ardent support of nearly all
the female portion of Melb. bike audiences, owed the
black - eye above - mentioned to a little affair with
the possessor of “a dirty left,’’ in St. Kilda dressing-
room on Friday evening. The dispute originated
over the merits of the handicapping, and the Queens-
lander, though beaten from the first blow, showed splen-
did pluck, and came up six times from knock-down blows
before receiving his quietus. However, the collision
didn t seem to affect Walne’s riding much, considering
he "ext day put down Megson and Martin for the
£25 Five-Mile Scratch.
Porta, Walne and Megson, finishing in the final
of the Mile, were locked together for the last 50yds. It
was a grand race, and though neither the Queenslander
nor the Sydney man could gain an inch from the time
they sprinted, the result, was unknown to the majority of
the spectators until the numbers w'ent up.
A party of Melb. cyclists took Green and
Edwards rabbit-shooting last week, and by way of en-
couraging the Englishmen, jokingly asked the somewhat
celebrated firm of Melb. gunsmiths, who were fitting out
the show, to fill the visitors’ pouches with blank car-
tridges. I can tdo that,” said one of tho gentlemen
who compose the firm, raising his hands in virtuous
horror. “ Vy, look at our reppitations ! ”
Bilmartin announces his speedy departure to
Europe to reach Italy in time for the cycling season. It is
obvious that Bill badly needs a rest, and, as the Australian
season shuts up shortly, he sees that he might just as well
take that rest on board ship, and arrive recuperated to
battle for further dols. When Martin reached Vic. in ’95
he was alleged to have cleared £l5OO in the Italian season,
just closed, but his faithful blue serge suit belied the
allegation, and no definite information re the Italian
winnings has since been forthcoming.
When Porta won his first race in Australia, he
was quite surprised to receive a cheque the following
Monday. In Italy, he explained, the successful competi-
tors have to chase the sports-promoters with stilettoes in
order to get the stakes.
After his win in the 50-mile race, Megson’s leg
swelled so badly that he reckons he will take a couple of
months to resume his old form.

Tasmania has lately begun road-racing largely.
Races on two consecutive Saturdays brought 33 and 41
before the starter. So far, the handicapping is weird.
In the first race (14 miles) one man was given 28min. i.e.
2min. in every mile, and he naturally romped home. ’ On
Queen s Birthday there will be a race from Launceston to
Hobart (130 miles), when, perhaps, 70 riders will be on the
road.
* * * *
Porta writes to contradict the statement that he
couldn t get his prize-money from the Westralian biking
clubs. On the contrary, the hardworking Italiano is so
well satisfied with everything Westralian, and so anxious
not to hurt anybody’s feelings, that he would seem to
have another foreign raid in view.

On Town Hill station, in the Mitchell dis-
trict, statistics of three years show that out of 37
oattle shot for cancer 22 were white, 13 light roan,
and two only were dark roan—which means that
35 figrfet-colored cattle are cancerous there for every
two dark oancerous beasts. But, when “ lumpy -
jaw ” cases of shooting come in, out of 24 shot
only four were white, and eight were red, whereas
12 dark roans were bulleted. Which points to
blonde cattle being specially cancerous, and
brunettes specially “ lumpy-jawed.” Statistics
from other stations would be interesting.

The Eye-sight measure per post by the in-

well-knownopticians of George-st., Sydney, enables
eye-sufferers in the country to ascertain the data
necessary for obtaining proper spectacles. The
subtler forms of sight-defect cannot, of course, be
measured by the instrument, but it is thoroughly
effective for the more usual forms of eye affection—
long sight, short sight, old sight. Full particulars

A number of rev. business men who run
shops with pews in them waited upon railway-
manager Mathieson in Melbourne, the other day,
to raise a chorus of howls over the running of
Sunday trains, but when their complaint was de-
finitely stated it was found to arise from the cir-
cumstance that the trains were timed to arrive
either after church was in, or too late to enable
people to rush round and be in time for the collec-
tion. It is a favorite superstition amongst parsons
that people are perfectly wild to go to church
most of the time, and they think the universe
ought to be run on special lines to provide men
with every facility for getting to the temple early
and often ; and yet it is a melancholy fact that the
parson spends his time during business hours de-
livering stirring exhortations to empty benches.
Commissioner Mathieson could not alter all the
trains, and it did not occur to him to advise the
clergy to run their churches in accordance with
the railway time-table, which strikes The Bulle-
tin as the reasonable course.

Wanted a name. The Argus doesn’t
desire the parties which must arise in the Federal
Parliament to adopt the American names, “De-
mocrat” and “Republican”—the latter is too awful
and too suggestive. It doesn’t want “Demo-
crat” and “Tory” or “Conservative,” for it
doesn’t admit that it is Tory. It objects to being
called the Fossil-party or the Stomach-party.
Yet when an all-Australian Parliament gets
together it will almost certainly shake down into
the usual two parties—the party of Progress and
the party of Stagnation, and a party needs a name
just as much as a dog does. Also, there will be
another division between the men who want to
continuously strengthen the union and those who
want to uphold the States against the union.
The party with the most brainy leader will set up
first as the advocate of Federalism and try to
shove the other by the natural cussedness of poli-
tics into supporting Provincialism. The best
thing the Progressive crowd can do when the
Commonwealth Parliament meets is to label itself
“National” right off, and announce itself as
the party of union, and let the Argus crowd
scramble for a name and take the principles that
are left after the Nationals have selected their lot.

Premier typewriter itself is going everywhere—

mometer is 30° below zero, and where it averages
80° at noon.*

Melb. Age notice of Bach’s “ Passion ” at

which have benefited to an exceptional extent by
what it heard.”

- - - MIRACULOUS CURES.
A few words as to the progress and growth in
public favour of the Registered Alfahne Herbal
Remedies would not be out of place here, and
would be additional evidence as to their real
genuineness and great virtues as claimed for them
by Herr Rassmussen, their discoverer and sole
proprietor.
The great virtues of the Alfaline Herbal Reme-
dies are so well known that it is quite unnecessary
to say much in regard to them in this notice; the
very fact of their having been before the public
for so many years, and continually growing in
popularity, is quite sufficient evidence that they
are all they are claimed to be. Taking into con-
sideration the fact that they have been awarded
the Parisian Gold Medal, and that so many thou-
sands of original and unsolicited testimonials have
been received, and may be seen at the Head Office,
some of which appear in his pamphlets, there
should be no difficulty in predicting a great future
for these health-giving Remedies unprecedented
in the History of Herbal Remedies.
About twelve years ago Herr Rassmussen intro-
duced these Remedies to the Australian public by
opening a Depot for their sale at 547 George
Street, Sydney, N.S.W., his present Head Office,
and although at that time he did not advertise in
any journal, the wonderful virtues of these Reme-
dies were known far and wide within a few
months. Orders for them came from every
quarter, not only from all the Australian colonies,
but from all over the world. In 1891 the clamour
for the Alfaline Herbal Remedies had become so
great that it became impossible to supply everyone
from the Sydney Depot. Letters arrived by thou-
sands, many orders came by telegraph, and some
people even travelled over a thousand miles to
make sure of obtaining some of these God-inspired
Remedies. What was to be done ? It was Herr
Rassmussen’s duty to see that every sufferer from
the Blood, Skin, Nerves, Liver, and other affec-
tions, whose very life and happiness depended on
these Remedies, should be able to obtain same
without undue delay. Herr Rassmussen had thus
no other alternative than to open Branch Depots
for the sale of the Alfaline Remedies in every
colony, and, if possible, in every country in the
world, as he desired to keep the sale of his Herbal
Remedies in his own hands entirely, and thus
avoid the agency of chemists, who generally have
a substitute which they prefer to sell instead of
the real article. A start was made at once in that
direction, and a very large and palatial Depot
was opened at 150 Bourke Street, Melbourne, in
1891. Immediately after, a fine Branch was
established at 154 Rundle Street, Adelaide, fol-
lowed by the opening of an extensive Branch at
ill Lambton Quay, Wellington, New Zealand. A
large Branch was then established at the corner of
Hay and William Streets, Perth, W.A., and
shortly after another Branch, next to Coolgardie
Hotel, Bailey Street, Coolgardie, and N 0.2 Lin-
riell’s Chambers, Hannan street, Kalgoorlie, W.A.,
not to forget the very extensive Branch opened
some seven years ago at 160 Queen Street, Bris-
bane, which is now the Head Depot for Queens-
land, and finally a Branch just opened at Charters
Towers, North Queensland.
It is not unreasonable to ask, “Is it possible
such success should follow unless these well-known
Herbal Remedies are all they are claimed to be,
and is it likely that their popularity should keep
growing to such an extent, unless they contained
exceptional virtues out of the common ? ” The
evidence that Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal Remedies
contain wonderful virtues is simply overwhelming,
as he possesses thousands of I estimonials to that
effect.
The whole of these Branches are each doing a
large and flourishing business. There is not a
country on the face of the globe where these Re-
medies have not been heard of, and orders ar- : ve
daily from the uttermost parts of the earth.

Mr. Button writes later:—“The Pills I had from you
were of great benefit to me and others. In one case,
when three hunters and trappers were travelling about
the ranges near my place on the Rose River, one was taken
very ill; his mates intended taking him in a waggon to
Wangaratta (about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor.
I gave him a few of your Pills. lam pleased to inform
you that, having to pass their camp next day, I found
him up and pegging-out his skins and looking well. This
speaks volumes for your valuable Remedies.’’

Blood Pills, I was under the treatment of a doctor for six
weeks, but was getting no better ; and I shall never regret
trying your Alfaline Pills, as they had a wonderful effect

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year 1871 I contracted rheumatism
and stiffness in the joints, and have tried all advertised
medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a great diffi-
culty in walking. Passing your window, I saw a testi-
monial from Mr. E. W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same
complaint as I had, which led me to try your Remedies.
On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of your
Pills, and I am now, with the blessing of God, as well in
health as I was 23 years ago. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.—l
remain, Dear Sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir,—l hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer
from General Debility of the System for oyer seven years,
and having tried without success several of the leading
doctors both in Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to
try your Alfaline Remedies. lam thankful I did so, for
after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies I am now
completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recom-
mend your remedies to anyone suffering as I was.

A Sufferer Cured of Piles,
I suffered terribly from Piles, but, thank God, I got
immediate relief from your Alfaline Pile Remedies. I
have not been troubled with them since, and it is now
two years ago. I have recommended them to many
friends, who hless the day I told them about it. I cannot
thank you enough for the cure your Remedies effected
in my case, and the relief it gave me from continuous
suffering. J. KILLERIDGE,
Lucanow, N.S.W.
A Cyclist Cured of Piles.
It affords me very great pleasure to bear testimony to
the efficacy of your Alfaline Pile Powders, which cured
me after almost every known medicine had failed. My
case was a most serious one ; it had been caused through
bicycle-riding in wet weather, and the Piles were of the
internal kind and caused me the most excrusiating pain.

REFERRING TO
The Wonderful Virtues
OF HIS FAR-FAMED
Alfaline Herbal Remedies.
The Australian Press has fully recognised the noble
mission of Herr Rassmussen, and praise bestowed upon
him from this important source has not only been most
whole-hearted, but also very generous. Our space will
not permit to repeat one-tenth of his best Press notices,
but the following will suffice to show the public the esti-
mation in which Herr Rassmussen is held by the Austra-
lian Press: —
Sydney Bulletin. —“ Herr Rassmussen’s well-known
Herbal Remedies have been the means of performing
many great cures, which his numerous testimonials will
prove.”
Evening News, Sydney.—“ Herr Rassmussen has
shown us some highly complimentary testimonials, certi-
fying to important cures effected by his remedies.”'
North Melbourne Advertiser. —“ Herr Rassmussen’s
wonderful Herbal Alfaline Remedies have done more good
than all other known remedies put together.”
N.Z. Times, Wellington.—“ Herr Rassmussen manu-
factures some excellent Blood and Nerve Remedies.”
Daily Telegraph, Launceston, Tas. —“Herr Rass-
mussen is a clever botanist.”

EIGHTEENTH REPORT.
Presented to the Shareholders at the Ordinary General Meeting 1 on 21st April, 1897.
The directors have pleasure in submitting herewith balance-sheet and statement of accounts to Slst March, which are
made out in the form prescribed by the new “ Companies Act, ’ and are duly audited and certified ; the net profits,
after defraying all costs in connection with the reduction of capital, amount to £3398 9s. 6d., out of which the direc-
tors recommend the payment of a dividend at the rate of 3 per cent, per annum, which will absorb £2250, and leave
a balance of £ll4B 9s. sd. to be carried forward. The directors are pleased to be able to announce that the resolution
to reduce the Bank’s capital, which was carried unanimously at the special meetings held in February, has been con-
firmed by the Court, and duly registered. The Bank being now free from the incubus that has hampered it for so
long, the directors can, with perfect confidence, appeal to the shareholders to assist the institution in every possible
way by opening current or deposit accounts, or by introducing good mercantile business. The liquid business is
sound and profitable, and, with the help of shareholders, could be largely extended. Shareholders are requested to
forward their scrip to the Bank, in order that it may be exchanged for fresh scrip, in accordance with the altered
capital. By order of the Board, H. T. WILSON, Manager.

Row’s Assorted Bitters
CONTAIN
Row’s Dandelion Bitters.
We recommend these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day ; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purity the Blood and Liver.
See what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them moat
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY
CHARLES CURTIS, M.R.C.S., England.

Baron Berzilius’= —
Buchu Bitters.
BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
These Bitters I recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chromo
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.
Read what Medical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D. :—The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in cases
of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D.-8888-I find these Bitters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. I therefore thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D.—lt is the purest of Bitters, and
exerts a peculiar influence over the liver.
Row’s Steane’s Bitters.
STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen:—
Statutory Declaration.
“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare as follows :
“ That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
1 hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“ (Signed) G. HEWETT,
“ 215 Pitt-street.
Row’s You’ll Do Bitters.
All who suffer from Chest Complaints, Cold, Coughs
and general weakness of the Lungs, will gain more ease
and comfort from a wineglass of ROW’S YOU’LL DO
BITTERS than any cough medicine tried before.
Row’s Pepsine Bitters.
All who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon
be cured by these Bitters, taken three times a day
before meals.
Row’s Oriental Bitters.
A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumbler of
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagne.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
eneral depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to al
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonio. Try it.
rr/?i^T? TAIiLERS find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur*
passed.
CAUTION.—When you call for these ask for
ROW’S, and take no substitute.

Melb. : “I think a sensible outcome of
*97 will be the Victoria Hospital. Book Arcadian
Cole and others have imagined the scheme, as the
best chimney-shaft for the exuberance that is to
be realised in some form of subscribing money.
The site will be Latrobe-street, Melb., and the
institution is proposed for women and children
under female-doctor management. There is a
good deal of animus against “ the Anglican toffy
tabbies ” who boss the existing Women’s Hospital.
Charles Hall, committed for trial at Ben-
digo (Vic.), is charged with a somewhat novel
development in wife-murder. Mrs. Hall was
found in her night-dress, kneeling beside a tub
with her head under water, and quite dead. The
case for the defence is that she was washing her-
self and fell into the water in a fit, and was
drowned, or else that she suicided, or else that it
is siihply a mystery. The prosecution alleges that
Mrs. Hall never had fits ; that Hall had the usual
reason for wanting to get rid of his wife (the usual
reason, in such cases, mostly has golden hair and
very small, shiny boots), and that he held her
head under water until she was drowned. It was
Hall who first gave the alarm about his wife’s
death ; he didn’t take her out of the tub, bub
simply ran for assistance. The defence alleges that
he had just come home and found her dead ; the
prosecution claims that he had just finished hold-
ing her head under water when he started call-
ing for help. Bendigo, or rather the adjacent
little town of Eaglehawk, mostly regards Hall as
guilty—any town would, under the circumstances
—for the sufficient reason that, if he isn’t guilty,
a really picturesque horror will be spoilt. What
it is especially proud of is the mark of the rim of
the tub, which some theorists claim was caused by
Hall sitting on his wife to keep her steady while
he shoved her head under. This is the sort of
artistic touch which has hanged many a man ; it
isn’t in human nature to readily let go such a
really first-class bit of melodrama as the ac-
cused sitting on his wife to keep) her from
jumping while he drowned her head in a bucket.
Judging by the police-court proceedings it is
evident that the case will turn, in part'at least, on
the question whether there were soap and towel
in the room. The Crown lawyers persistently
enquired about these accessories, the idea being
evidently that, if there were no soap and towel,
Mrs. Hall was not in the act of washing herself
when the alleged fit came on her. This will pro-
bably open up a new question. Suppose it was a
very small bit of soap and it had dropped into the
water and dissolved unnoticed. And suppose the
lady had forgotten about the towel. One witness
was even asked if there were soap, towel, and
flannel in the room. Is everybody supposed to
wash with a flannel ?
Quaint item of evidence in re the Hall
mystery at Eaglehawk (Vic.): “I saw an experi-
ment tried with a Mrs. Morton, who was about
the same size as Mrs. Hall, with the object of
seeing whether the position of deceased was a
natural one.” The question at issue was whether
Mrs. Hall had been kneeling before a tub of water
when she fainted and her head dropped in, or
whether some one sat on her and shoved her head
in. Apparently the ladies of the locality have
since then been experimenting with each other,
and possibly sitting on each other in front of tubs
of water, to see how the attitude works.
A tale of suffering almost on a parallel
with the old-time Pearce horror comes from Tas-
mania. Two prospectors, Joseph Davies and
William Beech, left Hobart on Jan 7th last for
Port Davey with six months’ provisions. Arrived
at their destination, the fishing smack which
brought them left, and they stored their provisions
in a hut erected for the purpose. On 20th, return-
ing from a prospecting trip inland, they found the
hut and all provisions burnt; only a few rotten
potatoes remained. There was nothing left but to
make for Strahan. They lived on snakes, crabs,
dead fish and anything else they could find, and
finally they had to eat their dog. Their track lay
mostly along the beach. Heavy rains set in and,
on March 4th, while crossing the Mainwaring
river, Beech was drowned. Davies continued
alone and reached Macquarie Heads pilot station
terribly exhausted and with his feet in a pitiable
condition. It had taken him 54 days to travel 80
miles —as the crowflies. Extract from diary: “Had
scalded dog’s skin and feet for dinner to-day.”


Torquay (Eng.) Gazette, Dec. 9 :
“Every child in Australia who is not supported by
parents becomes a ward of the State, and is paid a pen-
sion for support, and placed in a private family, where
board and clothes are provided until the fourteenth birth-
day. After that he may be able to go to work, in which
case the pension is placed to his credit until the age of
18, when he becomes a citizen, with a balance due to him
from the State to begin life with. This inculcates a
humane, charitable, and responsible spirit in all residents,
decreases the chance of pauperism, and places every
young man on a fair and square footing with the world.”
This record bears the imprint of truth, but it
omits to say that these wards of State have a daily
allowance of gardenias, and shirt-collars of alarm-
ing altitude, chucked in. They have also the
entree to all theatres, and the very nicest society
on the nod, with the pick of the finest girls at all
balls, picnics, &e. —to say nothing of free passes
over all railways, and the privilege of getting all
drinks at half-price.

A Dutchman, the other day, got work as a
miner in W. A. and was shown into one of the
drives. Soon after his advent, one man said there
must be bad air in the place, another said it was
bad dynamite, and a third thought there must be
something dead about. Presently, however, they
began to eye the new-comer’s bag with suspicion.
“What have you got there, Dutchy?” one en-
quired. “ Dot is my lonch,” said Dutchy. On
being opened, it was found to contain a lump of
rotten cheese. “ But,” said its owner, apolo-
getically, “dotvas not to eat; only to schmell
und give an abbetide.”

When the Shearers Go A way .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Tis lonely on the station when the plains are wet
and wide,
’Tis lonely when the plains are dry and brown,
You can’t be very cheerful when the saddle burns
your bide,
And ditto when the floods are coming down.
We don’t feel over-pleasant when the final load of
wool
Is swallowed up in dust and distance gray ;
It wouldn’t do to show it, but our pannikins are
full
Of sorrow when the shearers go away.
The shed is like a graveyard, and but yesterday
the din
Was deafening—we heard it from afar;
We heard the woolpress rattle as we rushed the
stragglers in,
And shearers shouting “wool away” and
“ tar ” ;
The yarder hustling sheep about and yelping
like a hound—
How earnestly that yarder used to pray
And curse, and make his pack-roll on the woolly
backs resound !
We miss him since the shearers went away.
The silence seems to settle ’mongst the rafters
once again,
Forgotten in the days of work and song ;
And strange, fantastic shadows that we cannot
quite explain,
Depress us like the memory of wrong.
No slush-lamps meet the twilight, the galley fire
is dead ;
No shouts from lusty throats, nor laughter gay ;
No groups around the grindstones, no bleating
from the shed—
No nothing since the shearers went away.
When darkness hides the brown and dusty sun-
cracked plain from sight,
And silent buildings sleep ’neath silent stars,
We seldom care to wander near the gloomy huts,
for night
Brings memories whose presence somehow jars ;
The shades of last week’s revels grin and leer
from every crack,
And gambol ’mongst the bunks in ghostly play ;
Our hearts beat fast, and faster beat our foot-falls
up the track—
We’re nervous since the shearers went away.
They left us prematurely when but half the clip
was through,
In troublous times a year or two ago ;
They struck work in a body, like a mutineering
crew,
One evening as the sun was getting low.
They said they had their orders “ fiom above ” to
down tbeir tools,
And orders they intended to obey ;
We tried how to persuade them they were some-
thing worse than fools —
But cheered them as they slowly rode away
At times we want to sling the place and travel
with the boys
From shed to shed, and follow up the Spring,
Escape the station silences, and share the griefs
and joys
Of those who take what luck the road may
, brin & ’
Wed leave the dusty drafting for the mortgagee
to do —
’Twould do him good to swelter for a day—
Perhaps his death-grip would relax if he experi-
enced, too,
Our feelings when the shearers go away.
JOHN DRAYMAN.
In the Settlement.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I.
It was a dreary winter night. Henry Vignold
stood in the doorway of his store surveying the
scene with sombre eyes. He hated it, he hated it all.
The rain pattered heavily in on him, and gathered
in little heads on his rough, serge coat —the coat
whose cut and finish made the most unobservant
dweller in the settlement mark him out as a man
from town. The canal, a brown and muddy strip
of water, poured noisily over the drop, and the
canal hank was one long stretch of mud. The
houses near, little two-roomed weatherboard huts,
looked drearier than ever, with the light shining
through their tiny windows and through the little
chinks in their walls. He had not lit up his own
rooms, and the blackness behind him was not
cheering. “What money,” thought Vignold
“could repay a man for living in a place like this?”
The grey eyes looked at the canal longingly. It
would be so much less wearisome to be lying at
the bottom, forgetful for ever of tbe unspeakable
dreariness of life and tbe hopelessness of labor.
His thirty years of life had been pleasant enough,
yet he would not wish to have them over again.
And the years that were to come had no interest
for him. He knew what life was. There was
nothing new under the sun.
The woman who lived over the road lit her lamp
at last. He watched till she did, as he had often
watched before. The light flashed over her yel-
low hair and lit up with freshness her worn face.
The people of the settlement told strange stories
of Mrs. Bardew. Her husband was away—he
generally was away, Vignold remembered —and
Mrs. Bardew often came to the store about his
business.
Sbe was an amusing woman, and a pretty one.
Vignold was always glad to see her. Any incident
or any person that led him to forget his surround-
ings for a little while was not to be despised. He
would smoke a pipe and go in to light his own
lamp. The little flicker of the lighted match
made Mrs. Bardew aware of his presence in the
darkness.
“Aren’t you dreadfully dull?” she called out
in her sweet, high-pitched voice. “Come over
here and keep me company. I’m dull, too.”
Vignold looked over his shoulder irresolutely at
the blackness behind him. It was very dreary.
Mrs. Bardew was a most amusing woman, and if
she did not mind the proprieties, why should he ?
He was dull, he was lonely, and the woman
tempted him.
Vignold turned the key in the lock, and crossed
over the road, whistling softly, “If this be vanity
>>
So, lightly, blithely, he entered into bondage. . . .
Mrs. Bardew amused him, and spent his money,
and ordered his affairs. Fortunately for Mr.
Vignold there came a time when money was less
plentiful, and Mrs. Bardew less affectionate, and
much less amusing.
When the disreputable and drink-sodden indi-
vidual calling himself Mr. Bardew at last appeared
on the scene in the character of a virtuous and in-
dignant husband, Vignold was ordered out of ihe
bouBe .
Shortly after, the Bardews disappeared. They
did not, a, a rule, star long in one place, and
Vignold turned his whole mind to the task of re-
storing a neglected business and re-gilding a
tarnished name.
jj
-w-r • ~ . ,
Vignold stood on the canal bank, watching the
Shining water with absent eyes, and thinking of
Lizzie—Lizzie who loved him and whom he loved.
When one is happily in love there should be no
weariness and no sadness; yet Vignold looked both
tired and sad as he stood there in the sunlight,
It was just two months since he had met Eizzie.
It was two years since he had seen the last of Mrs.
Bardew. Why had he ever seen the womans
tempting, evil face. If Lizzie should come to
hear about it, what would she say? His pretty
Lizzie, who at this moment was most likely sur-
veymg her image m the glass with serious eyes,
to see if all was as Harry would like it. Lizzie
had such dainty, pretty ways, such a trim, sober
fashion of dressing.
Lizzie s father could soon be coaxed over. Ever
since the evil days of Mrs. Bardew Vignold had led
a straight, steady ife. He had given no woman a
second thought till that delicious, rainy morning
when Lizzie came his way, with skirts held deftly
from the mud, and mind much troubled about the
feathers m her hat. His waggonette proved then
a haven of refuge. How pink-cheeked and fresh
she looked, withthe ram-drops glistening on her
curling hair! How child-like and innocent her
sweet-voiced talk ! Ihe friendship begun under
the coyer of the old waggonette had lived through
ramy days and dry, had grown strong and mighty,
had blossomed mto love. What man could tell
such a shameful tale as his to the girl who loved
him ? A little girl with brown eyes and pink
cheeks and a smile like the sunshine. A little
lass as innocent as the day. What would she say
when she found her hero was hut a man as other
men—nay, even worse ? It was no use to hide it.
Such stories always come to light some day. If
he sold out and, with reckless hardihood, began
life anew in some distant place, still that story
would find him out. No, he would tell Lizzie,
and have it over. She would be kind, he knew.
But Vignold shrank from his determination as
he thought of the wonder in those soft eyes, the
doubt, the dread, the utter bewilderment. “What-
soever a man soweth, that shall he reap.” Now
he knew what the words meant. With a half-
uttered curse at his folly he turned away. It was
nearly time for Lizzie, and with the thought of
Lizzie’s smile of welcome he cast unpleasant
thoughts behind him and hurried on to meet her.
“ Harry,” said Lizzie, half-an-hour later, as she
sat on the bank arranging some wattle-blossom,
“ Harry, our mailman has got married.”
“ Lucky man,” said Vignold, lazily.
“ Oh!” said Lizzie in a shocked voice, “Harry!
But he’s only got 13s. 6d. a week for carrying the
mail! And he hasn’t much time to earn any
more, and Harry, you know he isn’t clever. I
don’t think it’s right to get married like that I Do
you ? ”
“ Like that,” repeated Vignold, vaguely, as his
thoughts flew back to that old story—that stoi y of
®®till untold. The mailman might get only
bos. bd., but he had no secrets to hide. That is
best of not being clever. “What a little
woman you are for thinking about what’s right,
Lizzie! You re always saying it.”
asked Lizzie, wistfully,
L 5“" a ereat hand at dolng
<< tt g , ’ ,/ , T • • ~ ..
uj™ 1 u! _ returned Lizzie stdl wistfully
There s-there s lots of things I’ve done that
1 shouldn t have done.
“ That’s what it says in the prayer-book,’ l said
Lizzie, contentedly. “Harry, you frightened
me t I thought you meant-dreadful things.
Like one reads about, you know. ”
And Lizzie, whose experience of the evils of
this world was very, very limited, slipped her
hand in his, in mute apology for the passing
traitorous thought. There were bad men, she
knew, who gambled, and drank, and swore, and
did—dreadful things. But that was only in hooks,
or perhaps in Melbourne, or further away than
that. Not here, where she knew everybody and
everything. Not here, where she loved everyone,
an d everyone loved her. And if Harry had been
careless (her mind flew back to a possibly irregular
attendance at church) he was a dear, good fellow,
and she was very fond of him.
A nd as Vignold, following out his own train of
thoughts in the silence, looked up and caught the
swe etness in those brown eyes, and felt the touch
0 f that tender hand, he forgot—as who would not?
_ a n e ] se but that he loved her<
So it ever was. All through that beauteous
spring-time, while the wattles blossomed and
f ade d, they met and parted, and still the story
remained untold. Vignold almost forgot it. It
seemed so long ago, as if it were not he, hut
another, who had sinned. Some poor unfortunate
who had not known how sweet were truth and
love and constancy, nor seen them mirrored in his
dear one’s eyes. Some lonely wretch whom God
had forgotten. But, as for himself, had he not
a i wa ys dwelt in Paradise securely ?
HI.
In the early summer they were married. There
was nothing to hinder. Lizzie’s father was im-
patient to be gone, and glad to put his daughter
into such good hands. Lizzie herself made no
objection. She hated the thought of Harry living
all alone in that draughty store, careless of him-
self and his health as such men are. Cups half-
washed, floors unswept, badly-cooked meals,
haunted her housewifely soul. She knew Harry
didn’t take enough care of himself. The little
rooms at the back of the store took on anew aspect
under her skilful hands ; the little garden plot was
planted afresh when Lizzie’s peaceful reign began,
The days went by swiftly and smoothly. It was
only long afterwards that Vignold looked back on
them and realised how truly blessed they had been.
Lizzie proved herself shrewd and business-like,
and he grew to ask her advice and listen to her
more and more. Yet she was just his little girl,
as soberly decided, as innocen ly narrow-minded
as when he went along the canal bank on Sunday
afternoons to meet her. Vignold did not meet her

now—he wer* to church regularly. Whatever
Lizzie’s wistiul eyes asked he could not refuse.
And Lizzie, seeing his old, careless ways leaving
him day by day, smiled contentedly and said noth-
ing. She had always known that at heart Harry
was the best of men.
They had been married nearly a year when the
storm burst. Lizzie went out ono morning to the
gate —some strange woman had beckoned her. A
rough, untidy woman, with yellow hair unbrushed
and uncombed, and dress that hung in crumpled
folds around her. So much Lizzie noticed, and
then she saw that the stranger had a handsome
face with bright, blue eyes; eyes that surveyed
her with a curiosity that she felt unwarranted.
“Are you Henry Vignold’s wife?” demanded
the stranger peremptorily.
“Yes, ’ said Lizzie, checking her footsteps at
the strangeness of the questioner’s manner.
“ Well, tell him I want to see him, will you ? ”
the woman said, not heeding Lizzie’s gentle dis-
approval.
Instead, she leaned upon the gate, surveying,
with the same air of curiosity, the trim, little
garden, with its bordered paths and the blossom-
ing fruit-trees beyond.
“ Harry ! ” called Lizzie sharply. Whatever
could the woman want ?
Vignold came to the door, strolled down the path
towards them, stopped abruptly as she herself had
done, and the three stood in silence.
“ Why, Harry,” said the woman smiling, “you
needn’t forget who I am altogether. It’s not so
very long that you’ve been a virtuous husband,
and I’ll be bound you haven’t forgotten the old
days yet,”
Lizzie stayed to hear no more. She turned
away and walked back to the house with an un-
faltering step, and shut the door noiselessly. She
sat down, weary, and put her hand to her head,
wondering in a helpless fashion what had confused
her so. The bright spring sunlight had dazzled
her eyes ; there was something in the freshness of
the morning that had taken her strength away.
And Harry, why was he talking to that woman
so long ?
It was just a minute or two after that Vignold
came in and stood in silence beside her.
“ What did she want ? ” asked Lizzie wearily.
“ She came about some business for the store,”
Vignold made answer, putting a gentle hand on
her shoulder. “Come and have your breakfast,
Lizzie. ”
“ When did you know her, Harry ? ”
“ Long ago, before you came here.”
“ What did she want I” asked Lizzie, twisting
herself away from him. “ Harry, tell me.”
“ She wanted money,” said Vignold doggedly.
“ Did you give her any ? ”
“ Yes.”
Was this his Lizzie with that white, frightened
face ? “ Why did you, then ? ” she asked. “ Oh,
Ml me, and have done.”
Vignold told her, in stumbling, broken sentences
and by slow degrees. Bit by bit that old tale
came out. And when it was finished he had no
other word to add in explanation or excuse. His
wife lay sobbing in his arms, and he could not com-
fort her. The happy light was gone from those
tender eyes, the soft pink from that child-like
face. And he could not say one word.
A customer came. Lizzie drew herself away
and tried to stay her tears, and her husband went
in to his day’s work. To-day, as on all other days,
he must dispense tea and sugar, and explain the
merits of gaudy calicoes to talkative and close-
fisted customers. He must reckon up endless six-
ponces and shillings correctly, and all the while be
thinking of that still, white face and those tired
eyes. He longed for the day to be over, that he
might—stupendous task !—charm the haggard
look from his dear one’s face and bring content-
ment back again. Yet, when he went in to tea,
the same helpless silence came upon him. He
talked mechanically about the day, and the people,
and the business he had done, but said no word of
the morning’s revelations. Lizzie shrank from
any approach to the subject. She made no com-
plaint and asked no more questions. Vignold felt
as though he could almost see the barrier that
reserve and silence were building up between
them. And still he could say no word.
The days passed and Lizzie grew paler and
thinner, but fretfully resented any notice being
taken of the change. “ It was nothing,” she said.
Oh ! the torture of those dreadful days! His
penitence, his tenderness, were all of no avail.
Lizzie endured his solicitude with apathy or else
was annoyed by it.
One day he came upon her. crying as if her
heart would break, but she hushed her tears at
his approach, and turned away. Yet she was
never unkind, but looked after his comfort and
waited on him as tirelessly as ever.
“Perhaps,” he thought with an aching heart,
“ one day she will turn to me again.” He could
do nothing but wait. All the world was changed,
and he remained the same —to endure the days as
best he might, and pray that he might for a little
while forget that other happy spring-time so long
ago. How could he find the way to her heart
again ?
IV.
A month later. Lizzie was setting the table for
tea when a knock came to the door, and she turned
to her husband with frightened eyes. She, who
had never known what nerves were, was now thus
easily startled and afraid.
Vignold rose to open it, but the door was flung
open, and the strange woman appeared on the
threshold, this time with a child in her arms—a
little boy about three years old. She was dressed
for travelling. “ Here, take the child,” she said,
placing it in Vignold"s arms. “I have enough to
look to without bothering with yours. I’ve seen
the last of this place.” And she shut the door
again, and went out as suddenly as she had come
in. They heard the sound of wheels as she was
driven away. Lizzie went on with her work with
trembling hands. “Don’t let the child cry so,
Harry,” she said.
"V ignold put the little fellow down, and walked
out bareheaded into the night. Along the road
he went, not knowing and not caring where, until
he passed some reeling tramp upon the road, when
he turned back, remembering that Lizzie was alone
and would be frightened.
The little room looked still and peaceful when
he returned. Lizzie was sitting sewing by the
lamp-light, and the child, pink-cheeked and curly-
headed, slept in an improvised bed in the corner.
“Don’t fret about it, Harry,” his wife said as
he came and stood over the child, “ It can’t be
helped now. You’ll have to get a cot fixed up in
that corner.”
He timidly touched her hand in mute gratitude,
but she hastily drew it away and rose to prepare
his supper.
How she managed so well with the child Vignold
wondered often. She was not fond of children,
and this little waif was unused to order and
obedience. He was a pretty little fellow, with
yellow curls—and grey eyes like V:ignold’s own. In
a day or two his former home seemed forgotten, and
he attached himself unreservedly to Lizzie, who
tended him with faithful, albeit somewhat puzzled,
patience. His little feet never pattered i ery far
away from her, his little tongue never tired of
telling her wondrous stories of his wonderful child-
world, his little hands clung to her with childish
love and happy child-like certainty of love re-
turned. Was the child to bring them nearer to each
other, or more hopelessly to keep them apart ? lor
a long time the struggle went on, Lizzie’s pleasure
in the child’s pretty ways and her remembrance
of his mother struggling each to be uppermost in
her mind. Vignold waited, but not now so hope-
lessly. He had a stronger partisan than he knew.
Vignold’s grev eyes looked at Lizzie from the child’s
face, filled with all the love that he himself
was afraid to show ; childish sorrow and remorse
for his little sins and misdemeanors made her
think more tenderly of her husband’s humble be-
seeching. Little by little the light came back to
her eyes again. Would they ever shine on him
with their old tenderness ?
He stood wistfully watching her, as she bent
over the cot in the corner, and pulled the bed-
clothes up closer round her little charge.
“ Harry,” said she, turning to him with that
look in her eyes he had so prayed to see, “how
like he grows to you ! ”
And she slipped her hand in his, and drew him
nearer to watch the little sleeper.

Memories.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The longing of the deaf for the voice of the world,
of the blind for the light, of the lover for his lost
mistress, in which soul and flesh cry out together
passionately, only to sink back in trembling bitter
silence how the wonder grows that death is
feared at all, that it is not rather life that terrifies.
It terrified us twenty years ago, do you remember f
Yet the years have gone somehow. I have not
seen your face, nor touched your hand, nor heard
your voice in all that time. On this earth we
will never meet again, and is there a hereafter ?
A vague, wide eternity, a misty, crazy haze,
where even a thought or a kiss would fall through
were it carelessly dropped. It must he more than
that (this eternity) ; it must give you to me body
as well as spirit. You, with the dimpled chin,
the wide, grave eyes. You, with your ribbons
and laces, and tiny French shoes, flashes of
temper, and impulsive repentance. Twenty years
ago, and memory is steadfast to that one sweet
year worth an eternity of commonplace happiness.
Worth all the tears and agony that came after,
worth any penance that earth or hell can devise.
Our secret has been ours alone, has out-balanced
all other joys and sorrows. We loved each other
and were parted, but the gain of our love out-
weighed even our loss.
We are growing old now, and are very lonely,
but the love is as strong as twenty years ago.
Your glove lies with some old dead roses ; your
faded picture is on my wall; for the rest I have
the memory of one year, and perhaps a little hope
for that hereafter of which you spoke so bravely.
However it be, I have loved you, have gained
your love; though the grave be final, and I never
see you more, yet I can be glad and utterly grate-
ful for that one perfect year.
There is an old log on a far-away hill, half
hidden among bushy saplings, bracken, and
kangaroo-grass. There are great white gums
with flapping strips of bark hanging from their
shining limbs ; and around the wide valley the
abrupt, encroaching mountains. Here and there
brown patches of ploughed land, flights of cocka-
toos and parrots, and the warm spring sun finding
the reds and golds in the young transparent pepper-
mint-leaves ; the brilliant blue of the distant hills
the hazy mist by the river where the wattles
hang over the clea-, rapid water. Do you re-
member it ?
There is a winding mountain road, where the
rough track is bordered by high trees and flower-
ing hazel, and twigs and dead leaves crackle under
the horses’ hoofs. Where, here and there, shows
a clearing, a bark hut, a raw new fence, and a
wilderness of gaunt, ringed trees. Jays clatter
overhead, blue-wren 3 flit about among the under-
growths. There are sudden dips and turns in the
track, steep places where the horses slip and
scramble and frightened rabbits scurry away into
the friendly cover of ferns and sword-grass. All
around are the mountains, far away in the East
there lies snow on the taller ones, and a rosy glow
is reflected as the sun sets in the West. Do you
remember ? The night is passing, the stars are
growung dim in the grey sky ; the years are pass-
sing also, and have been lived for you and through
you. There have been dreadful moments of realisa-
tion when the hopelessness became physical pain
when my empty firms stretched out into the dark-
ness for you, and through each smallest vein
tingled the longing which burnt in my heart and
eyes and lips. But I have loved you, and to have
loved you is pure gain. And maybe there is a
hereafter ; come what may, we have had one per-
fect year. And so, good-bye !
S.O.S.
Maoriland was much shaken up of late by
a sensational vitriol-throwing case. One man had
cut another out in the affections of his best girl,
whereupon the loser of the girl went a long way to
call on the other man —or, at least, he went a long
way and they’ met—and, w hile they were together,
a quantity of sulphuric acid flew over the success-
ful rival, being, it was commonly alleged, thrown
at him by his infuriated adversary. Two juries
and a Judge wrestled with the case at great length.
The Judge directed the second jury to consider,
among other things, whether the vitriol was
thrown “ with intent to do any bodily harm to
the complainant or to disfigure him,” which
opened up the great possibility that it might have
been thrown out of benevolence, or by way of
congratulation upon his marriage, or something of
the kind. Then the jury went one better by ex-
pressing a doubt as,to whether it was thrown in-
tentionally or not, sulphuric acid being a thing
which any man might have about him by acci-
dent, and which might uncork itself and rush out
of his pocket entirely “bn its own.” Finally, the
verdict was ‘‘not guilty.” The verdict may have
been right enough, but as much can't be said of a
Judge who wants to consider whether vitriol
might not have been thrown with the best of
motives, and a jury which thinks it may haveb en
thrown accidentally or may have thrown itself.

fix. Herbert has been an officer in the U. S. naval service for the past 16 years,
duties have taken him all over the world, and he lias been on a constant go for
* il! Voral years, through the Dardanelles, around the famous rock of Gibraltar, in tho
®Mediterranean, through the Suez Canal, about the South Sea Islands, in Hawaii,
1 round Capo Horn, to South America, Africa—everywhere, almost, under the sun ho
’has cruised as a navy officer. On his return from one of his voyages the strain told
on him. His blood was in a very had condition, and his stomach was weakened,
and, as he says, he was “ knocked out.” Mr. Herbert says:
“Although I look very hearty now, four years ago my health and physical con-
dition were anything hut good. Then it was that I found the constant knocking
about had at last told on me. My blood was very poor and my stomach as had. I
had been cruising about in the service for a long time without any rest ami without
ceasing from my duties. Frequent changes in water and climate, such as I experi-
enced, will weaken and debilitate the strongest of us, and I was no exception. In
fact, I was completely run down, and when I came home my family insisted on call-
ing in the doctor. He prescribed for me and did all he could, but nothing came of
it, and I grew worse. As my blood seemed chiefly the cause of the ti'ouble I thought
I would give Ayer’s Sarsaparilla a trial, seeing it advertised to cure such cases. I
took a bottle in an aimless sort of a fashion, but when I found it helped my stomach
and was commencing to clear my blood, too, I thought there might be some real
merit in it, and accordingly began on a second bottle. Well, to make a long story
short, the third completely cured me and restored me to my old-time health. My
blood was better than ever, and my stomach did not bother me in the least. Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla cured me. Now I take it whenever I feel that my system needs it, and
I do not consider myself equipped for a cruise anywhere without a bottle of Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla. It has, I assure you, my hearty indorsement and recommendation.”
