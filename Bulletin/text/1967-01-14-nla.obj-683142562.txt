Freaks and Monsters
WITH the violent attacks on
head of State, Liu Shao-chi,
and on former Communist Party
Secretary-General, Teng Hsiao-
ping, Communist China’s great
purge is reaching a new climax. It
has now crept to the top. When
it started a year ago its victims
were a handful of relatively power-
less historians and academics. It
moved on to vilify and tear down
key figures in the Peking muni-
cipal branch of the Party, and
occasionally in the Army and
Propaganda Ministry. It then
broadened out to destroy vast
numbers of people in universities,
newspapers, the arts. Later, the
famous Red Guard youths were
mobilised to root out “freaks and
monsters.” Now a full-scale purge
of the Party at all levels is under
way and the Revolution is eating
not only its children but some of
its fathers. The latest reports, for
example, indicate that Tao Chu, a
Vice-Premier in charge of the
Great Cultural Revolution at one
stage, was recently dragged around
the streets of Peking to the taunts
of the Red Guards.
The old “progressive” image of
Communist China as a harsh but
stable and efficient monolith of a
society is shattered. Evidence
comes increasingly to light that
China has never been that. The
latest suggestion is that, following
the utterly disastrous Great Leap
Forward of 1958, Mao Tse-tung
was so discredited that even he was
temporarily purged. China’s
economic performance under the
Communists has also been a ter-
rible failure. The latest grain har-
vest is assessed at 175 m. tons,
representing a fall for the second
year in succession. It falls from a
low level, too —185 m. tons in
1964, which was hardly any
higher than the 1957 and 1958
levels, when the population was
much smaller. The Communists
have proved themselves incapable
of the pragmatic administrative
methods which have been so suc-
cessful on Taiwan.
The great purge has naturally
exacerbated this already poor
economic performance. It has dis-
placed many of the managerial
elite, terrorised most of the rest,
frequently disrupted transport and
factory work, and closed educa-
tional institutions for a year.
There are some encouraging
signs. Regular attacks on “counter-
revolutionaries” indicate that com-
monsense and sanity do survive in
the brutal and insanely ideological
atmosphere of Communism. Can-
ton newspapers report, for instance,
that Peng Hsiao-chien, a deputy
governor, is being railed at for
having said such outrageous things
as: “Grain comes from the earth,
not by muttering political hocus-
pocus in the air.” China, too, is
increasingly isolating herself in the
world, reducing her chances of
doing much diplomatic mischief.
But the political threat remains.
China still has two big weapons —r
so-called People’s Wars of insurg-
ency as in Vietnam, and the
nuclear missile system which she
will possess within six or seven
years. Both can be countered if
the Free World has the will to do
so and refuses to indulge in opti-
mistic daydreams about the nature
of totalitarian systems. These
Peking crusaders will only be en-
couraged by our weakness. Resist-
ance will contain them and
strengthen the hand of the saner
and more peaceful among them.


Face of the Week
Two late 1966 wage increases
came into effect, the interim mar-
gins increase of 30 cents to $1.30 on
the national wage, and Second Divi-
sion Public Service rises of from
$640-$ 1376 a year. Following the end
of the Qantas pilots’ strike, 2000
ground staff men met in Sydney to
discuss wages and other issues. The
1966 total of 3095 road deaths led
to plans for stronger police action in
most States. 1967’s first armed
holdup occurred when two men
robbed a Victorian hotel of $7OOO
on New Year’s Day, and in the same
week $3OOO was snatched from a
Sydney woman, $60,000 was taken
from a payroll delivery van. Nine
U.S. Apollo moon project scien-
tists visited Australian tracking sta-
tions. Wild storms hit southern
Queensland twice during the first

THIS AUSTRALIA
The Kys to Canberra
By PETER SAMUEL
Just as it looked as if there might be some relief from the increasingly tiresome
brouhaha about our Vietnam involvement, it is on again. The grand bete noir of
the Left, South Vietnam’s leader himself, is about to be received in Australia, to
walk in the paths of the imperial Lyndon Johnson.
People are asking why he is coming.
The simple answer as seen from Can-
berra is that he is coming because he
wants to. He made approaches to the
Australian Government for a visit in
the second half of 1966, but these were
discouraged because of the imminence
of the elections and Mr. Holt’s efforts
at engineering the Johnson tour. In
his nineteen months as Premier, Ky
has already visited South Korea, Tai-
wan, Malaysia, and the Philippines, and
visits to Australia and New Zealand
would round off a program of estab-
lishing contacts and projecting himself
and his national cause in the anti-
Communist countries of the region. It
is also thought that he regards it as a
trial run for a tour of the United
States.
Mr. Holt could hardly have refused
to have him here.
After all, he was
received himself by I
Premier Ky and his!
Government, and to
refuse to recipro-
cate would be re-
garded as a very
serious diplomatic
rebuff.
One or two
Cabinet Ministers
may have doubts
about the wisdom
of the the visit, but
Mr. Holt is under-
Madam Ky
stood to be wholeheartedly enthusiastic
in his welcome. He likes Premier Ky, he
is optimistic about the progressive
direction in which South Vietnamese
domestic affairs are proceeding: and
he sees no reason for any equivocation
or reservation about pronouncing our
commitment to the cause Ky is leading.
Ky is regarded as being a very pre-
sentable man who will go down well in
his personal contacts with Cabinet
Ministers and public servants, and go
over on TV. Certainly the more he is
vilified by the Left, the shriller the
screachings of the protesters, the more
successful will his visit be in consoli-
dating local political support. Whatever
Ky’s deficiencies may be, he is so ter-
ribly obviously not a “moral leper,” a
“pocket Hitler,” a “Quisling gangster”
or a “butcher,” that the ordinary Aus-
tralian watching him on television will
only wonder at the sanity of those who
say such things.
But the pro-Communists have for the
time being given up trying to partici-
pate in domestic politics under-
standably, after the elections. They will
be out to work off frustrations and to
the extent there is any political logic
in their violence it will lie in aiding
their friends in the United States in
their campaign to reflect on President
Johnson, by feeding the Press with
easily reportable evidence of opposition
to American policy.
Once again Communist metal and
building industry union leaders will
hire buses and hard-working profes-
sional “peace organisers” will provide
the mechanical inspiration for “spon-
taneous popular” protest demonstra-
tions: and once again an alienated,
myopic minority wall reiterate its
terribly moral desire for an end to
the agony of the war, and arrogantly
Nguyen Cao Ky
claim a monopoly
of such good faith.
They almost de-
| mand a contemptu-
ous yawn. So far, at
least, this is what
the departing Mr.
Calwell has got in
reaction to his out-
burst against Pre-
mier Ky the
loyal but excitable
Vietnamese Ambas-
sador aside.
But in among the
well-composted ver-
bal garbage which Mr. Calwell dir-
ected at the Vietnamese leader just
before Christmas, there was just one
solid piece of muck which someone
should muster the energy to pick up.
This was his accusation that Premier
Ky played a part in the murder of Ngo
Dinh Diem and his brother Nhu, and
was directly responsible for the execu-
tion of another brother, Ngo Dinh Can.
There is not a shred of evidence
to support these ridiculous claims.
Primary responsibility for the death of
Diem and Nhu lies with the junior
Army officers who killed these two meq
in an armored car on its way to Army
HQ in Saigon. A degree of responsi-
bility may also rest with the Army
generals who mounted the coup, some
of whom may have authorised the
killings. Nguyen Cao Ky was at the
time a lieutenant-colonel in the Air
Force, and not one account of the events
of November 2, 1963, suggests he played
any role in them.
Can, the most hated of the Diem


family, was convicted of numerous
crimes by a court in April, 1964, and
executed in May. Keesings records that
Generals Minh and Khanh were then
in power in Saigon and it was not until
September that Ky began to be the
least involved in Saigon’s turbulent
politics. By December, Ky was one of
a group of officers in their 30s who
were identified as a new political force,
and dubbed the Young Turks. For a
month in early 1965, Ky was Minister
for Youth and Sports, his first position
in Government. As late as March he
was busy flying bombing raids against
North Vietnam, and only in June, 1965,
did he assume a position of real power
when he emerged as the strongest of a
young triumvirate.
The only executions in Ky’s time
have been of a Chinese blackmarketeer
and several Communist terrorists caught
after murderous bomb crimes against
innocent people in Saigon streets.
End of a Gerrymander
Arguments for and against bigger or smaller local government areas are many,
varied, and often heated. But the most vehement advocates for bigger areas offer
no arguments on behalf of the City Council of Sydney.
The existing boundaries there, they
point out, represent one of the worst
gerrymanders in Australia’s political
history. On January, 1, 1949, a State
Labor Government under Premier Jim
McGirr extended the City Council’s
boundaries to absorb eight suburban
councils. The ALP drew the boundary
lines carefully. They edged past Wool-
lahra, Waverley, Randwick, Botany,
Bexley, and other municipalities which
traditionally elected independent repre-
sentatives to civic office. But they
looped around Paddington, Waterloo,
Alexandria, Redfern, Erskineville, New-
town, Darlington, and Glebe all solid
Labor-voting areas.
ALP aldermen have controlled the
City Council ever since - defeating
opposition candidates by a monotonous
13 seats to seven as regularly as the tri-
ennial elections take place.
Now all that is to end. The Askin
Government has announced that it will
erase the existing gerrymander and
restore the city boundaries to lines
almost identical with those existing be-
fore 1949. The Government has adopted
the unanimous report of a four-man
Boundaries Commission Messrs.
Vernon Treatt, QC, G. I. Ferris, of
the Sydney County Council, F. E. Pog-
son, of the Local Government Depart-
ment, and H. F. Jensen, then Labor
Lord Mayor of Sydney. Areas absorbed
into the city in 1949 will be redistri-
buted but not to eight re-created
councils, which would be both costly
and difficult.
• 238 acres with 5650 voters of
Northcott Ward (Camperdown, New-
town, Enmore, etc.) will go to Marrick-
ville Council.
• 330 acres and 10,383 voters in Fitz-
roy Ward (Paddington) will go to
Woollahra Council.
• 525 acres and 9529 voters in Phillip
Ward (Glebe) will go to Leichhardt
Council.
• And another 2603 acres and 23,945
voters of Northcott Ward (Erskineville,
Redfern, Darlington, Waterloo, Alex-
andria, etc.) will be formed into a new
municipality to be known as Northcott.
This will leave a city of 3255 acres
and 46,819 voters, with property worth
$1262 million in improved capital
value. Property with an improved capi-
tal value of $203 million will go to the
other areas. Thus more than 75 percent
of the nearly $l5 million now extracted
by the City Council in rates each year
will be spent on less than half the area
it now covers.
No doubt rates now crippling many
city businesses will be reduced. But the
new City Council will still enjoy an
income from rates that will enable it
to improve many existing civic services
and facilities.
The State Government does not need
legislation to change council boundaries.
The fact that Local Government
Minister Mr. Pat Morton has
announced his intention of introducing
legislation for the job indicates that
he has more than boundary changes in
mind. Almost certainly he intends to
alter some voting procedures the
election of the Lord Mayor by the
council instead of the public, volun-
tary instead of compulsory voting and
improvements in the facilities for
absentee voters.
The Government will have a voting
majority in the Upper House from
April 22. Legislation enabling the
Government to carry out its plans for
the City Council can be expected at
the first sitting of Parliament after that
date. But it may be some months, per-
haps more than a year, before elections
for seats on the new City Council can
be held.
It needs more than good intentions
or a wave of the political wand to
achieve the changes. The council owns
a good deal of property, much of it
in the areas to be transferred. The coun-
cil also owes a good deal of money,
much of it on capital works carried out
in the areas to be transferred to other
councils. Just how these assets and
liabilities are to be apportioned, trans-
ferred, debited, and/or credited is a
complicated job for the best account-
ancy brains.
But Mr. Morton has said it was done
in reverse in 1949 it can be done
again. And a team of his departmental
experts have been working on both the
legislation and the machinery to carry
it out for at least nine months. Many
local government men particularly
ALP aldermen on the City Council
want to believe that the Government
will coast toward the boundary
changes and time them to coincide with
the next municipal elections due in
December, 1968. They underestimate
the strength of Mr. Morton’s deter-
mination. If he wants to make the City
Council changes and the municipal
elections coincide, he is much more
likely to bring the State-wide munici-
pal elections forward than to put the
City Council changes back.
On the other hand, it may trans-
pire that the boundary changes cannot
be made until the next municipal elec-
tions are due. But this is unlikely to
persuade Mr. Morton to allow the
present lopsided administration of the
City Council to continue in the mean-
time. Some recent events in the City
Council have disturbed both the public
and the Government.
These include:
• An ALP decision to transfer loan
funds from other purposes to remodel
the Domain baths at a cost of $538,242,
and a threat to use rate revenue to
finish the job if the Government refuses
Pat Morton
to provide a further loan allocation of
about $lOO,OOO.
• The appointment of seven senior
health inspectors (one of whom was
the brother of an ALP alderman) to
three vacancies.
• An ALP decision to accept the least
profitable of three litter-bin proposals
without logical explanation.
• The appointment of a Deputy Town
Clerk over the heads of officers senior
in rank and service with dangerous
effects on staff morale throughout the
Town Hall.
• The creation of a virtually free
dental clinic for council staff at rate-
payers’ expense.
• The acceptance of a development
proposal for the Hotel Sydney-Tivoli
site, which is now in serious doubt.
Many of these, and a number of other
decisions, were imposed on the council
by a divided ALP Caucus. Had those
who opposed the decisions in Caucus
voted with their consciences in open
council the decisions would have been
thrown out. These activities have
created grave doubts in the public
mind about the council’s efficiency and
integrity. They have also destroyed any

sympathy the public might have been
inclined to generate for the ALP aider-
men who are likely to lose control of
the council after the boundaries are
changed. And they have immeasurably
strengthened Mr. Morton’s arm in any
action he decides to take to end the
life of the present council.
Many informed observers believe Mr.
Morton will not wait for boundary
changes or elections to move on the
City Council. He is quite likely to dis-
miss the present council and appoint
a caretaker body to administer the
city’s-affairs pending boundary changes
and new elections. This could happen
within six months.
The ALP majority is trying to spread
the impression that the proposed
boundary changes will ensure a Civic
Reform majority and simply reverse
the gerrymander that has existed since
1949. This is not so. The new bound-
aries will create a situation which will
enable the voters to change the contro
of the council at elections.
Certainly, Civic Reform candidate
will for the first time in 18 years have
a good chance of gaining a majority*
But Labor candidates, too, will have
every chance in elections provide;
they are the right candidates, and pro,
vided they work hard both to win vote!
and improve the city. And that’s thl
rub. For 18 years now any ALP candi.
date for 13 of the City Council’s 2f
aldermanic seats could be sure of elec
tion without any effort or work on hi
part.
For this reason the ALP
tion has offered aldermanic election t|
many Party hacks for services rendered
privately in the past. The result ha;
been that many incredibly untalentet
men have held office as aldermen in thl
government of Australia’s premier city,
with drastic consequences for Sydney’
public image and prestige.
JOHN McISAAC
Hanging on in New Guinea?
“One might not he surprised that we Papuans and New Guineas are aware ot
police-state tactics in New Guinea. In all fields in Administration Colleges, insti
tutions, and even the new university, we have people who are employed or bribe!
by the New Guinea Police Special Branch. One is not really free to say anything
or express one’s views; if one does, then one is marked as an agitator, bighead
Communist, etc.”
This is one view of life in Papua-
New Guinea, expressed by an indige-
nous correspondent in the latest issue
of “New Guinea.” If even a small part
of the writer’s allegations are correct,
there is a definite suggestion here of
white people doing all they can to
hang on a colonial situation, something
the new Administrator, Mr. David Hay,
will have to consider when he takes
over this month.
“New Guinea’s” correspondent says:
“At the arrival of the Select Commit-
tee on Constitutional Development
people were hounded by Administra-
tion officials, who questioned council-
lors and some native leaders to find
out who were the people who were
outspoken and what they said. People
were even threatened in one of the
preliminary meetings. They were told
if the kiaps or colonial rulers got out
of New Guinea today, the country will
crash and there will be no progress.”
If this is so, why is it so? Why
should the kiaps fear outspoken men?
Only two weeks ago, Territories Minis-
ter Barnes told the United Nations
General Assembly that Australia would
be guided entirely by the wishes of the
New Guinea people. The corollary is
that they should be entirely free to
express them, and their fellows to hear
therri, at least to the point of normal
free speech in any democracy.
Another point of view, from another
“New Guinea” correspondent, is that
it may be entirely in Australia’s interest
for free speech to be maintained and
political awareness fostered. Writing
“From the Defence Angle,” John Kerr,
QC, president of the Law Association
of Asia and the Western Pacific, says
“We must not develop a fixation aboi}
holding New Guinea for defence ani
security reasons. We do not want th>
New Guineans to see Australia’s d(
fence ideas operating as a brake of
their progress to independence. We di
not want our defence presence (ant
all its apparatus of intelligence am
counter-intelligence activities) to pro
duce a sullen or hostile population.”
He suggests a procedure to avoid this
“a phased and announced approach tl
independence over the years to corns
If we say all this now, it may be tern
porarily hard to take in New Guinea
but, once said, there will be a gradual
adjustment to it. The future can the
be planned and thought about withou
risk of the frustrations flowing fron
New Guinea aspirations, which w
allowed to develop, knowing they coul
never be satisfied.”
Kerr’s message may be temporaril
hard to take in Australia, too. Opinioi
is divided as to New Guinea’s ultima!
relationship with Australia, varyin
from the “seventh State” idea, a “cob
stitutional tie” theory, to complet
independence with a treaty arrange
ment. Kerr favors the last, after cob
sidering the difficulties of the first twf
in offering at Australia’s cost, equi
social services, award conditions, an
free mobility of people and labor froi
New Guinea to Australia.
He throws cold water on any ide
of New Guineans having eve
limited political participation in Aui
tralian affairs, and on the idea of
constitutional tie which did not gi'
even limited participation it “woul


not be acceptable to the United Nations
or to the U.S. or the U.K.”
Finally, Kerr considers the defence
implications of a New Guinea tied to
Australia only by treaty, with or with-
out bases in that country. His thought
turns on “the simple proposition
that it is not important for us to con-
trol New Guinea’s foreign and defence
policy for the indefinite future. On
the other hand, it is desirable to fit
an independent New Guinea into the
framework of allied strategy for
security of Asia and the Pacific.
“Australia’s role in South-East Asia
must, for an indefinite period, be a
supporting one only and we are most
unlikely to undertake military initiatives
of our own in that part of the world.
We will be supporting the United
States and it is that country which has
to be and is able to be ready with
massive power for speedy intervention.
Our capacity has only to be fitted into
an already functioning military struc-
ture.”
Although “no expert on defence,”
Kerr has presented a constitutional
lawyer’s thoroughly reasoned argument
on many of the questions likely to be-
devil the people of Australia and New
Guinea for many years. Contrasted
with the deep official silence, broken
only by occasional temper outbursts
from Canberra, it can only create a
feeling of uneasiness about what is
being done for or to the future of
“over two million primitive indigenous
people with a small, indeed almost non-
existent, elite, with no political parties,
no nationalist movement, and little
agitation for independence,” who con-
tinue to “look toward a long con-
tinuance of the Australian connection.”

"As church art I still say it's too sentimental."
Dip. Hum.
Plans for Australia’s first non-
university Diploma in Humanities and
Liberal Arts will be debated by educa-
tionists at an all-day seminar in Mel-
bourne on February 24. The convener
is Dr. Phillip G. Law, the former
Antarctic scientist-explorer who is now
in charge of Victoria’s pioneer system
of tertiary colleges.
Victoria’s Dip. Hum., likely in 1968,
is the pattern of things to come
throughout Australia. As from 1967 the
Federal Government is diverting funds
(and therefore students) from the
costly universities to less lavish tertiary
colleges.
According to Melbourne academics,
there are several thorny questions
which will need to be argued out in
Victoria and later interstate.
• The present controlling bodies (the
Commonwealth’s Wark Committee on
Tertiary Education, Dr. Law’s Victoria
Institute of Colleges, and the councils
of individual technical colleges) con-
sist solidly of representatives of various
industrial, commercial, and govern-
mental interests. Can a detached, cul-
tured voice be included and heeded?
• Can a humanities diploma succeed
in the utilitarian atmosphere of a tech-
nical college, or would it flourish better
in a cultural institution like the East
Melbourne Conservatorium of Music
or as a separate new institution?
• Will pressure from employers (e.g.,
the Education Department) reduce the
Dip. Hum. to “vocational training for
future teachers, social workers, and ad-
vertising men” rather than liberal
education for free men?
• Will the Dip. Hum. standards of
entry and tuition be made high enough
to attract matriculated entrants and to
entitle diploma-holders to continue to
degree level at a university.
Dr, Law, who has just become
settled in his new job, insists that the
Dip. Hum. should be well planned and
widely approved. One technical col-
lege, the Royal Melbourne Institute of
Technology, which had hoped to jump
the gun by starting a backyard Dip.
Hum. in 1967, has now had second
thoughts. Now it’s 1968 at the earliest.

The Jesuit Influence in Australia
Papal caution will not deter their most adventurous spirits
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
ONE of the stories competing for a
place among the Top 40 of the
month in Australian clerical
circles is that the conservative Cardinal
Ottaviani of the Roman Curia sug-
gested to Pope Paul during the recent
Vatican Council that the opportunity
was open for the Pope to reprimand
and discredit modern freewheeling
theologians, especially those from the
religious orders, and particularly those
from the Jesuits, whose speculations and
imaginings were disturbing the post-
Reformation orthodoxy of the Roman
bureaucracy.
The Pope is supposed to have re-
marked that there was something to
be said for the idea, but better that
His Eminence take the suggestion to
the individual Bishops of the Arch-
dioceses where the unorthodox were
located and get them to act out of
their own fulsome episcopal powers.
Cardinal Ottaviani well knows the
reputation of his Curia among most
non-Italian Bishops and, so the story
goes, left the interview muttering some-
thing about “another time, another
place.”
The story illustrates some widely held
views and, so far as I can tell, correct
views:
• that there was an attempt by Curia
conservatives at the recent Vatican
Council to break the influence of a
number of the more speculative and
popular theologians;
• that there was an attempt to make
the Council a battleground of a clash
between the rest of the Church and
some of the more enterprising religious
orders;
• that Pope Paul feels that some of
his flock are wandering too far from
their traditional fields;
• that more than perhaps anything
else the Pope is anxious to avoid open
clashes among the Faithful and to
prevent situations arising in which open
and blunt use of the Papal disciplinary
powers is necessary.
Despite -the ambitions of the Curia,
there were no serious reprimands and
nobody was publicly discredited. The
religious orders played an important
role in the Council, and among them
the Members of the Society of Jesus
were outstanding. Opponents of the
Jesuits and of their leading speculative
theologians were, it seemed, in for a
long wait before they could hope for
“another time, another place.”
But the time was soon, and the place
was Rome itself. Last November 16
the General Congregation of the Society
of Jesus, a kind of Jesuit ecumenical
council of some 220 delegates, was
addressed by the man to whom its ser-
vices are presently offered, Pope Paul
VI.
Heaven only knows what this shrewd
assembly of administrators, intellectuals,
and pastors expected: their services are
dedicated to the Pope, but they are not
without insight into the political and
diplomatic pressures on the Papacy.
The Order was not without its detrac-
tors nor has it ever been but it
had come well, some said even bril-
liantly, out of the Council, and surely
the worst Pope Paul could do was em-
barrass the Northern European and
English-speaking delegates with the
verdant, luxuriant imagery of Roman
rhetoric.
In the event of the Pope’s Address
being made public, the embarrassment
was of a different kind. Part of the
speech, as given to the Press, contained
the sad remonstrance that there had
come “to our ears news and rumors
concerning your Society, and, moreover,
concerning other religious families, our
amazement and, in some cases, our
grief at which we are not able to
hide.
“The world, is mentality, and its
profaneness,” the Pope declared, was
an ever-present snare for those mem-
LAST week a leading British
Jesuit theologian , Charles Davis ,
finally announced his reasons for
leaving the Roman Catholic
Church. He gave as one reason
his “revulsion with the callous
dishonesty 99 of the Pope on the
matter of birth control. His
action in turn has revived dis-
trust of freewheeling Jesuit
theologians among conservative
Catholics. In this article Brian
Buckley discusses the role of the
Society of Jesus today.
bers of religious communities who
chafed under traditional rules of obedi-
ence and yielded to worldly currents of
thought. Such profaneness “causes the
salt to lose its sharp taste and the
apostle his original virtue.”
Most of the critical section of the
Pope’s address was in the form of a
rhetorical question, and he did praise
the Jesuits’ glorious past and confirmed
his blessing on those who believed that
the Church must adapt itself to the
times. However, most of the English-
speaking Church has interpreted his
address as a sharp rebuke to those
Jesuits (unnamed) who are allegedly in
danger of pushing out beyond the likely
limits of orthodoxy.
The American Catholic commenta-
tor John Cogley wrote in the “New
York Times”:
“It was not, of course, necessary for
the Pope to rebuke the Jesuits publicly.
Communications between the Vatican
and the Jesuit General Curia are con-
stant and normally discreetly carried
out. Many students of the Pope’s mode
of operation, in this case as in others,
believe that there was method in his
sadness. The public criticism of the
Jesuits ... it is believed, was meant
for others as well.”
The view taken by Cogley is shared
by most other English and American
commentators, but there are grounds
for wondering whether this interpreta-
tion is fully correct.
The Provincial Superior of the Aus-
tralian Jesuits, Father J. R. Boylen,
who was present in the Sistine Chapel
when the Pope delivered his address,
claims that “the whole tone of the
address was one of warm friendliness
and genuine appreciation and confi-
dence. The speech was one of the finest
tributes ever paid by a Pope to the
Society of Jesus.” Father Boylen also
says that some of the reported state-
ments of the Pope are incorrect and
that the section of the address about
disturbing “rumors” has been misunder-
stood. “Using the device of rhetorical
question, the Pope mentioned various
rumors that had come to his ears, and
asked if they were true. He replied
himself, comparing the rumors to clouds
in the sky which were found to have
blown away; in other words he dis-
misses them as untrue.”
In Father Boylen’s favor is the fact
that some of the Italian Press reported
that the Pope had bestowed “accolades”
on the Jesuits, and the unfortunate fact
that reporters hungry for a story can
make a terrible mess when confronted
with Vatican subtleties. On the other
hand, the Pope’s language was stronger
than usual, and he has not yet denied
the derogatory interpretations of his
speech. Perhaps the ambiguity was
intentional.
The contention about what the Pope
said, what he meant by what he said,
whether words have changed their
meaning by being removed from total
rhetorical context, is likely to persist
for some time; a source of scandal to
some, irritation to others, and amuse-
ment to more. The question seems
bound to join those many others which
history has asked and debated about
the Jesuits. No other religious order of
the Church has been the source of so
much religious disputation; nor is there
another order about which there are
so many misconceptions and myths.
The first commonly held and wrong
belief about the Jesuits is that it
was formed to spearhead the Papal
counter attack against the Protestant
Reformation. The notion is found in a
number of Protestant apologetics and
even some Catholic text books, but


there is little evidence that the founder
of the Jesuits was concerned about or
even knew much about the teachings
of Calvin and Luther until the Order
was well established.
The Society of Jesus was formally
established and approved by the Vati-
can over 400 years ago. Its founder, a
Spaniard, was then in his late forties,
having been born around the time that
Columbus was discovering the West
Indies. Ignatius Loyola made no claims
later in his pastoral life to having been
saintly in his younger days as a soldier
and a junior observer of the customs
of the Spanish royal court. A Jesuit
biographer earlier this century put it
rather primly: “While there is no sound
basis for believing him to have been
sunk in vice and shameless excesses, it
would seem that in the heat of youth
and amid the fires of temptation he
was sometimes carried into sins of lust,
pride, and passion.”
Don Inigo de Loyola created a
lasting reputation as an inspiring and
courageous military leader in a vain
attempt to save the town of Pamplona
for Charles V, but the French cannon
badly fractured his left leg and also
wounded his right.
During convalescence, in which he
endured a rebreaking and resetting of
the bones of his left leg and also the
sawing away of protruding bone, his
reading and thinking turned to the
things of the spirit. After his recovery
he hung up his sword and jewelled
dagger and dedicated himself to be-
come a warrior for God. He adopted
habits of extreme austerity and penance
and seemed to feel from those early
days that he had been called to perform
some singular service for the Church.
Not long after he was in some
danger from the Spanish Inquisition,
which had gathered reports of his
founding a fanatical sect, but he was
exonerated from charges of heresy
after 40 days’ imprisonment.
From the dungeons of the Inquisition
the spirit moved him toward the Uni-
versity of Paris, where he became an
alumnus of the college which a few
years before had sheltered a man of
equal determination, John Calvin. He
shared a room with two students who
were to become as great as any of his
disciples, Peter Faber and Francis
Xavier.
When the time came for Ignatius
and his “men” to set out for Palestine
and other points East, Venice and
Turkey were at war and the men were
left high in Venice. Ignatius had
already conceived that his followers
should, more than other Orders, offer
themselves to the personal service of
the Pope, and so his plans changed
from converting the East to working
on the more immediate problems of
the Vatican: restoring the Catholic
Faith and/or allegiance to the Papacy
to those countries which had broken
away from Rome, and spreading the
Faith in the New World opened up
by the great navigators of the 15th and
16th centuries.
Thus began the work for which the
Society of Jesus is most famous: the
theological, educational, diplomatic,
and even religious espionage work of
the so-called Counter-Reformation in
Europe, and the development of fresh
missionary fields in the Americas, Asia,
and the Pacific.
In the course of the past 400 years
the Jesuit Order, partly because of
its remarkable achievements, partly be-
cause of its ability to respond quickly
to new situations, and sometimes be-
cause of its own mistakes, has created
a host of enemies, and not all of them
outside the Catholic Church.
The combination of forces was too
much for Pope Clement XIV, and in
1773 the Papal Brief “Dominus ac
Redemptor” announced the death war-
rant of the Society of Jesus. Its leaders
were taken off to a Papal prison, but
somehow the Order survived in odd
places and underground over 41 years,
and it was restored by Pope Pius VII
a year before the Battle of Waterloo.
In the past century and half the
Order has regained and surpassed its
The Provincial Superior of the Society
of Jesus in Australia, Father J. R.
Boylen
former strength. Although it was not
founded by an important educational
institution, it has become the leading
teaching Order of the Church in uni-
versities, colleges, seminaries, and
secondary schools in many parts of the
world. In the Archdiocese of Mel-
bourne, for example, the Jesuits run
the two major seminaries for secular
priests as well as the leading Catholic
public school.
The Order could also claim to be
the major theological force in the
modern Church. The names of Jesuits
such as De Lubac, Rahner, Danielou,
Teilhard-Chardin, and Cardinal Bea,
in Europe, and Courtney Murray,
Weigel, and Ong are only a few of
the more prominent Jesuit theologians
whose influence was powerfully felt at
the Vatican Council. Their attempts to
rephrase and even reshape the structure
of Christian theology has been of great
importance to the apparent new vitality
of Catholicism; whether some of them
or their disciples have moved too far
from the essential Christian tradition
may be left to the determination of
history.
The Jesuit Order is also among the
leaders in pastoral work in missionary
areas and the delicate areas of political
and social action. In Australia the sup-
port of the Jesuit Institute of Social
Order for at least some of the causes
of Mr. B. A. Santamaria and his
National Civic Council has involved
the Order in some fierce political con-
troversies and been the source of fric-
tion between some members of the
Order and some of the “Liberal”
Catholic intelligentsia in Sydney and
Melbourne.
Critics of the Jesuits have claimed
that whatever the triumphs of the
Order in Europe and the American
continents, the Australian Province
can boast nothing very remarkable in
pastoral work, education, or theology.
If there is truth in this observation,
the matter probably has something to
do with the heavy Irish influence on
Australian Jesuitry. The Australian
Order is of the Irish tradition with all
that implies of the once necessary men-
tality of seige and the perhaps less
necessary puritanical rigidity.
The Catholic Church in Australia
has been accused of preaching mostly
a kind of religious insurance policy in
which prayers and pious practices are
the instalments and an eternal retire-
ment benefit the ultimate reward; if
this accusation is based on the evidence
of public sermons and religious publica-
tions, then it would seem that many
Australian Jesuits are open to a similar
charge. With certain notable exceptions,
their pastoral, educational, and theo-
logical contribution to Catholic Aus-
tralia has not been distinguished in
quality.
However, in recent years, the Order
seems to have generated new life and
purpose. The impact of European and
American Jesuit scholars has broken
through the barriers of Irish piosity
and Roman legalism. Instead of the
brightest young “men” completing their
training in Ireland or Rome, they are
now heading for centres where the
Order has most vitality. Some of the
younger Jesuits are already making
their mark in Australia in theology
and other fields of scholarship and it
may not be long before their influence
on education and parish life is also
substantial.
A mobile and resilient company of
men, tempered by a long and arduous
training, able to withstand the tedium
of suburban parish work as well as
the burning faggots of their enemies,
the Jesuits are the largest and surely
the most influential of the religious
Orders of the Church. Their religious
and political influence is strongest
during times of quick change and
experiment. It is unlikely that an
alleged Papal caution will stop or even
hinder their most adventurous spirits,
now that even the bonds of Irish
puritanism are burst.

Indonesia’s PKI
Sir,
It is with a sense of bleak frustration
that I pursue the argument about the
PKI and Indonesia with Dr. Knop-
felmacher (8., Dec. 24).
The PKI and the coup: In my pre-
vious letter (8., Dec. 17) I gave a num-
ber of grounds for suggesting that the
evidence at the Indonesian trials falls
far short of establishing PKI complicity
in the coup. In typical style, Knop-
felmacher reduces these to one, namely
“fabrication.” His purpose is clear
to discredit any challenge to the
“Communist conspiracy” thesis. Else-
where I have documented in some de-
tail the many 1 inconsistencies, and am-
biguities in the evidence. On the last
occasion upon which I heard him speak
on this subject, Knopfelmacher had
not read the evidence at all; judging
from his letter, he still hasn’t.
PKI and national bankruptcy: Knop-
felmacher is welcome to believe that
the PKI was the chief motor and in-
stigator of Sukarno’s adventurism. That
the facts are a good deal more com-
plex is a matter one can leave for
another occasion. The real point is that
Knopfelmacher evaded the challenge I
threw out to him—to back up his state-
ment that the PKI deliberately sought
to create national bankruptcy to ad-
vance its, aims.
PKI corruption: If Knopfelmacher
bas hard evidence of this, as opposed
to the kind of self-justifications the
Indonesian elite is busy sponsoring for
obvious reasons, he will be making a
real contribution to Indonesian scholar-
ship by revealing it, since it runs
counter to the findings of a legion of
Western specialists over the last decade.
The PKI and armed struggle: Yes,
I am aware of such sophisticated con-
cepts as “multiple interacting causa-
tion.” But it will take more than a
methodological cliche to demonstrate
to me how Knopfelmacher arrives at
the conclusion that anti-Communist
activists helped to prevent the PKI
launching an armed struggle which on
your account it had never contemp-
lated.

Opera in Australia
Sir,
I have just read the article
“Nationalistic Blackmail” (8., Nov.
26), referring to my work in Australia
conducting opera. It is quite true that
Edward Downes (of Covent Garden)
and myself, both of whom at various
times have been invited to become
Musical Director of the Elizabethan
Opera Company, feel that this post
must be properly created and filled
urgently. But we also feel that Aus-
tralia cannot hope to have international
opera properly led if it is not prepared
to make reasonable funds available for
this purpose.
On the other hand, the article gives,
perhaps unintentionally, an impression
which I would hasten to correct. I
bear no ill will to the ABC, nor to
the administration of the Elizabethan
Opera Company because it has not
found a means of confirming my
appointment. In consideration of the
severely limited financial plane on
which he was working, Mr. Young
(Administrator of the Elizabethan
Trust Opera Company) deserves the
highest praise for the artistic success
of the past operatic season.
DENIS VAUGHAN

TV Hangover
Sir,
Your television critic’s “flamming” of
the Pat Flower Playhouse, “Dad’s Nice
and Dave’s Juicy” and “My Name’s
Steptoe What’s Yours?” was well-
scalpelled work. And, being uncom-
mitted (and broke), I can tread right
on his home ground and throw in “The
Damp Dream of Miss Prim,” and that
particularly sneaky preview for ’67:
“Divorce,” which would seem to excuse
its dramatic shortcomings on the very
shaky moral grounds that it aims to
keep people out of the Divorce Courts.
These people should get an Emmy for
making adultery dull. Everybody is so
drunk on the heady novelty of seeing
Australian productions on the small
screen that they forget the hangover.
If you’re any sort of an artist, there
can be no compromise with your con-
science; whatever fancy names you tack
on it. If the ABC does nothing else it
should replay the BBC’s play “A Tap
on the Shoulder.” Which was a kick
down under. It was as simple and hard
to get as Truth. Lay off the retarded
illiterates, the suburban chimera, and
lend an ear to the most colorful Aus-
tralian of them all: the con-man and,
I warrant, you’ll have a story free of
‘ Plot Book” and full of poetry, com-
edy, and drama.

THE CLONTARF ORGY
86 Years Ago: January 8, 1881
The following famous editorial by
W. H. Traill led to a defamation
action by the manager of the Clon-
tarf picnic ground. He won one
farthing damages but, being unable
to pay the costs, ]. F. Archibald,
the associate editor, and John
Haynes, the advertising manager,
were arrested. They spent six weeks
in jail. W. H. Traill was not arrested.
THE scene presented by the
motley crowd at Clontarf on
Boxing Day is one never to be
forgotten by an eyewitness. It was
not an excursion—it was an orgy.
Large ocean steamers discharged
cargo after cargo of young Aus-
tralians. As their blood warmed by
dancing, and their passions became
inflamed by liquor, the scene within
and around the hovels which serve
for dancing and drinking became
indescribable. Horace has no descrip-
tions more revolting. Depravity of
physique thrust itself upon notice.
Young Australia here was repre-
sented by faces prematurely old—
countenances cunning, debased, dully
sensual, surmounting figures under-
grown, pieagre, and angular. There
were no manly youths. And the girls!
There was beauty of feature here
and there, blurred by traces of
intemperance and ravages of excess.
Female children not yet in their
teens romped around with gestures
and antics which would have shocked
a camp of black-gins. The males
barely restrained themselves to a
semblance of decency—the females
resented no familiarity. The devil
had broken loose.

Your chess column furnishes welcome

For Ned Kelly
Sir,
Initially, I was amused by M. H.
Ellis’ remarkable outburst “The
Legend of Ned Kelly” (8., Dec. 31).
However, the joke palled.
Although Mr. Ellis claims that it was
Kelly form “to sneak up on a camp
where police were cooking and wipe
them out like dingoes,” he proceeds to
give a comparatively accurate account
of the gunfight at Sfringybark Creek.
Mr. Ellis dismisses the Last Stand
in one abusive jumble of “vicious ruth-
lessness,” “insane paranoic evidence,”
“insane revengeful bravado.” He ignores
the fact that, badly wounded, after
spending four hours in the bush on a
midwinter night, Ned Kelly attacked
the police besieging the Glenrowan
pub in a magnificent attempt to rescue
his mates.
In short, Mr. Ellis ignores every
aspect of Ned Kelly’s career which
cannot be forced into the warped and
ugly mould he has chosen to create.

OVERSEAS
Behind the Struggle in China
Irom DENNIS BLOOD WORTH in Singapore
The turn of the year came to China with a burst of ideological fireworks. Presi-
dent Liu Shao-chi, marked down as the archenemy of Mao Tse-tung’s plan for a
classless society, has been accused in enormous characters on Red Guard posters
in Peking of 12 crimes under the general heading of “Vulgar materialism and
revisionism.”
Both he and Teng Hsao-ping, dis-
honorably discharged secretary-general
of the Chinese Communist Party, are
now reported for treachery to the Great
Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Mean-
while, the number of lesser devils of
distinction denounced along with them
multiplies almost daily, so that in the
upper circles of the Party and Govern-
ment hierarchy the damned now out-
number the blessed.
This is no political massacre, how-
ever, for the revisionist “power-holders,”
under their two vilified but prestigious
leaders, control much of the muscle and
sinew of the administration. Mao and
Marshal Lin Piao, his designated suc-
cessor and China’s most able strategist,
have no illusions on this subject. And
on New Year’s Day editorialists in
Peking spoke of “the group of incor-
rigibles who, in adopting the bourgeois
line, are certainly going to keep on
sowing trouble.”
The sin of the revisionists is that
they have no faith in the messianic
idealism of Mao Tse-tung, whose im-
mediate ambition is to remould the
minds of all Chinese so that they
abandon all thought of self and accept
an egalitarian society. This is the
uncompromising, almost fanatical
approach to Communism that has in-
volved China in a bitter dispute with
the Soviet Union and other sophisticat-
ed socialist States.
In these so - called Communist
societies, say the the
technicians and intellectuals lord it
over the peasants and workers, and a
vicious new class system simply re-
places the old. China’s revisionists dis-
agree. They deplore the quarrel with
the Soviet Union which has deprived
their country of much-needed technical
aid and know-how at a crucial period
in her economic and military growth.
They believe that China must
cherish her technicians and intellectuals
if she is to modernise rapidly and
efficiently. They are, therefore, accused
of trying to perpetuate a class-ridden
bureaucracy in which they themselves
hold entrenched and enviable positions
as Ministers, party secretaries, depart-
ment directors, technocrats, or minor
jacks-in-office. They are, in fact,
China’s modern Mandarins.
Since Liu Shao-chi was first attacked
some three months ago, the opposition
factions have shown some fancy foot-
work. Recently Liu’s “false” Red
Guards started pasting up posters de-
nouncing Maoism itself as revisionism.
But although the Mao-Lin faction
may have arrested and humiliated Peng
Chen, the disgraced Mayor of Peking,
to show that the revisionists were incap-
able of protecting their own in the
capital, they have not been able to
order wholesale sackings of their
opponents elsewhere in China. The in-
ference must be that they cannot rely
upon most provincial and local leaders
either inside or outside the congress.
In the Army the revisionists want a
modern professional force, well armed
by a friendly Soviet Union, rather than
Mao’s dream of a nation of indoctrin-
ated guerilla fighters. Critics of Lin
Piao include the senior commanders or
military commissars of at least five of
China’s 13 military areas and six top-
flight “generals” (the title is no longer
used) on the National Defence Council
and other summit organisations in
Peking.
'J'HE Maoists have recently paid tri-
bute to the toughness and strength
of their opponents in two ways. First,
they have tried to divide them: a care-
ful distinction has been made between
anti-party elements who have sold their
souls to the revisionist devil and those
who have only pawned them, and so
may still redeem themselve.s. Last
month Chiang Ching, the wife of Mao
Tse-tung, said that “hardened
reactionaries” must be “overthrown
and struck down completely,” but all
others should be given a chance to re-
pent publicly.
Secondly, the Mao-Lin group has be-
gun talking of the struggle of the
“revolutionary minority” against the
“reactionary majority.” This is a far
cry from the earlier claim that the fight
was against “a handful who had taken
the capitalist road.” Last month Madam
Mao went so far as to say that the
thought of Mao must be made to pre-
vail, even if the Maoists were out-
numbered. This directly contradicts the
quotation from Mao himself on page
255 of the little red book that all the
Red Guards wave: “The individual is
subordinate to the organisation.”
It can be seen, therefore, that the
revisionists are by no means disarmed,
and that while the attacks on Lin Shao-
chi and Teng Hsiao-ping on the Red
Guard posters may become increasingly
virulent, they are not necessarily the
writing on the wall.


Subversion in the Soviet Union
After Gerald Brooke , 16 English volunteers
From ALEXANDER BREGMAN in London
A REVOLUTION in the Soviet
Union? The idea may seem fan-
tastic. Gone are the days, in the
first few years of the Bolshevik rule,
when the fall of the regime in Moscow
was confidently expected every day.
In less than a year the 50th anniver-
sary of the October Revolution will
be celebrated by Communists all over
the world. Can one seriously believe
that another revolution, which would
destroy the work of half a century,
is approaching?
Yet there are people who not only
believe in such a revolution but are
working hard to bring it about. There
is an organisation in the West called
NTS, or Narodno-Trudovoi Soyuz, the
National Labor Alliance, which is
dedicated to this ideal and has many
followers in the Soviet Union. The
whole activity of those Russian Soli-
darists, as they call themselves, on
account of the fact that they reject
the dogma of class struggle and in-
stead proclaim the solidarity of all
men and all classes, is geared to this
one revolutionary purpose.
At this moment a young British
lecturer, Gerald Brooke, is languishing
in a labor camp in the Mordvinian
Autonomous Republic, 300 miles from
Moscow, for having considered it his
duty to help the cause of democracy
in the Soviet Union by smuggling in
subversive material on behalf of the
NTS. And he is not the only one
to support the revolutionary activities
of the NTS at such great personal
risk.
But perhaps the best indication of
the importance of these activities is
the seriousness with which the Soviet
authorities take them, as shown by the
relentless struggle waged by the Soviet
Secret police against the NTS, murder,
kidnapping, bombs, infiltration the
NKVD and its successors have tried
everything.
In the Frankfurt headquarters of
the NTS, Mr. Lev Rahr, who, with
his brother Gleb, belongs to the inner
circle of the organisation’s leadership,
told me the story of the Soviet Goliath’s
fight against the NTS David, with
its incidents, some famous, some prac-
tically unknown.
It started almost as soon as the
NTS had been born at a meeting
in Belgrade in 1930. During the war
the members of the organisation fought
on two fronts: against the NKVD and
the Gestapo. Their slogan was:
“Neither the Germans nor the Bol-
sheviks. For a Free Russia.” Russian
emigres of the younger generation
joined hands with anti-Communists
among the population of German-
occupied lands or with prisoners-of-
war and dbportees in Germany. But
in 1944 the Gestapo arrested a great
number of them and many perished
in concentration camps, while in 1945
the NKVD arrested all known NTS
sympathisers in the liberated territories
and also in Poland, Czechoslovakia,
Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria. But, rein-
forced by new exiles from the Soviet
Union, the NTS fought on, continuing
to send their emissaries to the country
in order to create an underground
organisation.
It was in the months after Stalin’s
death that the Kremlin became really
frightened and decided to hit the
enemy at its source. In February,
1954, the world was shocked to hear
the story of the Captain of the NKVD,
Khokhlov, who had been sent to
Frankfurt with orders to murder a
leader of the NTS, Okolovich, after
being trained for this task by a unit
headed by a General of the NKVD,
better known to the West as the one-
time Ambassador in Washington Panu-
shkin. But Khokhlov not only refused
to kill Okolovich; he went over to the
NTS and disclosed the whole con-
spiracy.
However, another conspiracy was
successful. Two months later another
leader of NTS, Dr. Thrushnevitch,
chairman of the committee for aid
to refugees in West Berlin, was lured
to a flat of a German agent of the
Soviet police. It is known that the
victim offered resistance, had been
beaten, and lost consciousness before he
was taken to East Berlin. The in-
tention had been to brainwash him
and make him declare that he went
over of his own will, but this failed.
Whether Dr. Thrushnevitch has died
from wounds inflicted during the kid-
napping, or succeeded in committing
suicide, or has been tortured to death
or simply murdered is not known; he
has never been heard of again.
Kidnapping and murder
another member of NTS was
successfully kidnapped in Linz,
Austria. But plans to murder the presi-
dent of the organisation, Dr. V. D.
Porembsky, or to poison Khokhlov
failed.
Next came bombs against NTS in-
stallations. In 1958 the building hous-
ing a monitoring station in Sprendlin-
gen, near Frankfurt, was blown up. In
1961 a bomb exploded in the court-
yard of the printing works of the NTS
weekly “Possev.” The following year
the organisation began to build a new
house for the weekly and its own print-
ing press; a bomb was found on the
site, intended perhaps to frighten the
neighbors so that they would protest
against such a dangerous house. The
same purpose may have been at the
origin of seven bombs exploding in
the wood in which the NTS radio
station, the Radio Free Russia, is
located.
Since the bomb outrage three years
ago there have been no new attempts
of this kind. How can this fact be
explained? Do the Soviet leaders re-
gard the NTS as less dangerous, I
asked Mr. Rahr.
Not at all, it is simply a change
of tactics, says the NTS leader. Mos-
cow must have come to the conclusion
that the bombs achieve nothing.
And, if proof was needed that Mos-
cow reacted with growing nervosity to
NTS activities, it has certainly been
provided by the trial of Gerald Brooke.
This trial was most significant, but
its real importance seems to have
escaped the attention of the West. And
perhaps the most important thing about
this trial is that it took place at all.
people still believe that the
Russians arrested Brooke and sen-
tenced him to five years, simply in order
to exchange him for the two spies in a
British prison, the Kruger couple. In
fact, the idea of exchange must have
come later. Once the trial took place
and served its real purpose, Brooke
became useless to the Soviet, and if
he could have been exchanged against
two valuable spies, so much the better.
But this was certainly not the prime
object of the whole operation.
When, in April, 1965, Gerald Brooke
became the first foreigner acting on
behalf of the NTS and helping their
anti-Communist activities to be arrested
by the Soviet secret police, a difficult
decision faced the Kremlin: should it
name the NTS at the trial or not?
Naming it, disclosing that an English-
man wanted to help an organisation
aiming at a change of system in Russia,
would make publicity for the NTS.
Yet without naming it the trial would
serve the main purpose, which
was to frighten the people and deter
them from any contact with the
organisation.
While rejecting Soviet accusations
that they are spies, diversionists, and in-
telligence agents, the NTS people do
not deny some of the accusations made
at the trial against Brooke and others.
For obvious reasons they are proud of
Brooke, whom they consider as an ad-
mirer of the Russian people, a religious
person, and an idealist who wanted
to take part in the struggle for the
freedom of Russia, fully realising the
risks involved. As for his main con-
tact in Moscow", a young doctor, Yurii
Konstantinov, the NTS claims that he


Gerald Brooke jailed for spreading democracy in the Soviet Union.
was their sympathiser and strongly deny
Soviet attempts to present him as
Brooke’s betrayer.
The NTS did not attempt to deny
that Brooke took to Moscow pro-
paganda material for Konstantinov:
a code for deciphering messages by
radio, specially prepared writing pads
for use with invisible ink, and, most im-
portant of all, a simple rubber print-
ing press and rubber mats with text
for printing leaflets. All this was
hidden in an album and a toilet case
he brought to Konstantinov’s flat,
where he was caught. It is also con-
firmed that Brooke took to Moscow
a certain number of letters and posted
them there and also a letter and a
copy of the Gospels for a sculptor,
Yurii Titov.
Has the Brooke trial achieved its
aims? It does not seem so. It has
failed to deter Westerners from risk-
ing their freedom on behalf of the
NTS. Mr. Rahr told me that after
the trial they received offers from 16
young English people to go to Russia
and take Brooke’s place. Of course,
some might have been provocateurs;
Soviet secret police has always made
great efforts to infiltrate NTS. But
no doubt many offers were genuine.
When I asked Mr. Rahr how many
missions like that of Brooke have been
successfully carried out in the past few'
years, the answer is staggering: about
500. If so, the Soviets have something
to worry about.
Yet sending couriers is only one
small part of NTS activities. An-
other, perhaps more important, is the
sending of propaganda by post. They
send material from dozens of different
places all over the world, under en-
velopes addressed individually by the
voluntary senders. Lack of funds has
restricted such activities, too. Some
years ago the NTS reimbursed the
senders for the postage but has had
to cease doing so; now every sender
pays for it himself. Yet the number
of volunteers is steadily increasing once
again.
The literature sent consists either
of leaflets, which resemble letters, of
an eight-page, small-size magazine on
thin paper, or of a regular letter “to
friends of the ‘Grani’ journal,” a
quarterly magazine of literature, art,
and politics, or sometimes books. In
all, some three thousand letters with
subversive literature go to the Soviet
Union every month.
How many reach the addresses? The
NTS people have made arrangements
with a small group of trusted sym-
pathisers to confirm by code the re-
ceipt of the material and, taking this
as a sample, they believe that 70 per-
cent of what they send goes through.
What is remarkable is the amount of
literature going to Russia after first
having been smuggled out of her. The
fact is that all these activities are a
two-way traffic. Novels, poems, essays,
and documents which cannot be pub-
lished in the Soviet Union are increas-
ingly sent by the authors to the West
and are published in Russian in
“Grani” or as separate books, which
then find their way back to the Soviet
Union.
The magazine started such activities
ten years ago and already in 1957
had been able to publish anonymously
the poems from Pasternak’s “Doctor
Zhivago” some time before the pub-
lication of the whole novel in the
West. But the flow has only become
really significant in the past few' years.
“Grani” published some novels, a col-
lection of short stories by Solnizhychin
banned in the Soviet Union, and several
books by Tarsis, who is perhaps their
most famous recruit. Already in Mos-
cow he did not hide his sympathies
for the NTS, to which he formally
gave the Russian rights of “Ward No.
7.” Since his arrival in the West he
paid for the printing of 3000 copies
of this book to be sent by some means
or other to the Soviet Union.
Of course, not all books of Soviet
authors sent abroad found their way
to “Grani.” Many important ones,
like the novels of Sinyavsky and
Daniel, reached the Polish emigre
magazine “Kultura” in Paris. But the
role of “Grani” is important, too.
The Sinyavsky and Daniel trial
aimed at terrorising the writers and
deterring them from sending manu-
scripts abroad. But it is already clear
that this attempt ended in complete
failure. Only a few weeks after the
trial, which was secret, the transcript
of the main parts of court preceedings
reached “Kultura” and was also pub-
lished by “Grani.” (It has since been
published in book form in America.)
Now “Grani” have published in their
last issue 38 documents concerning
the Sinyavsky-Daniel affair, and not
only the fact that they reached the
West, but their contents indicate the.
extent of the authorities’ failure.
Those documents prove that, far
from intimidating Russian intellectuals,
the authorities have only angered them
and provoked them into an open and
courageous protest against such per-
secution.
only did many intellectuals de-
cide to protest, but they did so
almost publicly. As the editors of
“Grani” reveal, the documents they
publish circulate in Russia in the form
of a compilation, a sort of “white book”
on the Sinyavsky-Daniel case. The col-
lection begins with a leaflet appeal-
ing to the public to come to a
protest meeting against the arrest
of the two writers at the Pushkin
monument in Moscow on December 5,
1965, a meeting which was forcibly
broken up by the police. Then there
are numerous letters before the trial by
writers, critics, and scientists to Prime
Minister Kosygin, to the Presidium of
the Supreme Soviet, or to newspapers,
which did not, of course, publish them.
More important still are protests against
the sentence, such as an appeal
addressed to the Presidium of the Party
Congress by 62 prominent men of
letters, including Ehrenburg, for Sin-
yavsky and Daniel to be freed on bail,
and a telegram protesting against the
dismissal of the only defence witness,
V. D. Duvakin, from his university job
at the Moscow State University. His 18
colleagues from the Philological Faculty
state that such “illogical decision”
harms the reputation of Soviet justice,
for Soviet legal procedure guarantees
the freedom of witnesses to appear
“without fear of any consequences.”
Thus the intellectuals’ anger and fer-
ment find expression in a pamphlet
circulating in Russia, then being
smuggled to the magazine published
by NTS in the West, and finally going
back to the Soviet Union in print. Such
a state of affairs must be alarming to
the Kremlin.
It seems only natural that the NTS
leaders see in all this an encouraging
sign. Even if they know that a revolu-
tion in Russia is not for tomorrow.


ONE MORE
WEEK
Novel Approach
THE TELEVISION documentary pro-
gram “Seven Days” recently had a
program featuring those indefatigable
opinion-makers John Douglas Pringle,
Frank Hardy, Donald Horne, and Craig
McGregor, and called “Contemplating
One’s Navel.” The program had its
moments, although rubbing a few ideas
together doesn’t necessarily give you
sparks. However, one viewer watched it
with some fascination, but in the mis-
taken belief, through careless reading
of the TV programs, that it was called
“Contemplating One’s Novel.”
International Style
WE REPORT with some fascination
that the new Wentworth Hotel in Syd-
ney, built by Qantas for $ll million as
an international hotel, is already achiev-
ing a rich Australian flavor.
Two women we know one an
English visitor were there last week.
They decided on a drink before lunch,
and went into the Coral Reef Lounge,
off the main entrance. They were
charmed by the rich blue carpet, the
mother-of-pearl ceiling and soft light-
ing; all in all a charming place. They
sat at a table and a waiter came up.
“Are you accompanied by a gentle-
man?” he asked. Well, no. “Then I’m
afraid you can’t come in here.” Very
polite he was.
But the implication (by the manage-
ment, not the waiter) that they were
common prostitutes plying their trade
was clear. There is no other rational
explanation. Then the waiter added his
helpful little bit. “You can get a drink
upstairs,” he whispered, in case they
were alcoholics as well.
Now that Qantas is back in the air,
we imagine this sort of approach by
the Wentworth is going down very well
with the international visitors Qantas
is so anxious to fill its hotel with. If
the Wentworth wants to run its hotel
this way it should at least put up a
notice at the door of the lounge stipu-
lating its conditions of entry, and for
baffled visitors explaining why. Then
at least the embarrassment will be the
hotel’s and not its customers’.
Sir Stephen's Hen's Tooth
THE APPOINTMENT of Dr. Bernard
Smith as Power Professor of Con-
temporary Art at Sydney University is
hardly a surprise choice, although it
was not, perhaps, the most obvious one.
We shall resist suggesting that the chief
surprise is that the university has at
last moved in this matter, five years
after it first heard with what feel-
ings can only be imagined that Dr.
John Wardell Power had left about
$3 million (since reduced because of
depreciation in MLC Ltd. shares) to
establish a Chair and a Gallery.
The Vice-Chancellor, Sir Stephen
Roberts, announced last September that
Mr. Gordon Andrew Thomson, of the
Victorian Gallery, had been offered the
lesser job of Curator of the Gallery.
We understand he has accepted. Sir
Stephen said then that people qualified
and willing to take the Chair were as
“scarce as hen’s teeth.”
We understand that Dr. Smith, who
has been Reader in Fine Arts at Mel-
bourne University since 1964, did not
apply for the Chair when it was first
advertised. He has recently been in
Paris studying 19th century color
theory. While he was there an approach
was made to him.
If there is a feeling in art circles
against Dr. Smith, it would be that an
overseas appointment might have had
advantages. There is something to be
said for someone not too involved in
the local scene, but, more importantly,
the Power Gallery (establishment of
which will concern the Professor and
which may go ahead before study-
courses) is, under the will, to acquire
contemporary art. Australian art is not
excluded, but is very much incidental.
Someone who had worked consistently
closer to the large centres where art is
bought and sold in quantity may have
brought something useful to the job.
Still, Dr. Smith brings a good deal
to it. No local art historian has pub-
lished as importantly as he has. Until
Robert Hughes’ survey is published
and probably after it is, if it is
Smith’s “Australian Painting” will re-
main the only up-to-date standard
work. More than this, Smith is the only
writer who has committed himself on
a large scale to a theory of the direc-
tion of contemporary Australian art.
It is on this theory of Australian art
that Smith’s reputation mostly, and
probably unfairly, hangs. Smith, as
author of “European Vision and the
South Pacific,” is held beyond re-
proach, yet his vigorous historical skill
is often overlooked in favor of Smith
as author of “Place, Taste and Tradi-
tion,” “Australian Painting,” and the
“Antipodean Manifesto.”
His writings in contemporary art
have stirred many passions, but the
sabre-rattler of the Antipodean Mani-
festo has not been very obvious in his
recent reviewing for the Melbourne
“Age.”
The Anachronism
WHEN BRITISH racing driver
Donald Campbell, killed last week, was
at Lake Eyre in South Australia in
1963 for land-speed record attempts a
handful of Australian journalists, in the
excitement of the trials and in the long,
frustrating hours of waiting for some-
thing to happen, got to know him well.
One of these was Leo Basser, who
writes: “To go out at 310 m.p.h. in jet-
boat Bluebird was a fitting finale for
the cocky British ace, and probably the
way he would have wanted it; not a

speed ace had died in bed in the twi-
light of his years.
“Campbell was a pert little man, full
of self-confidence but alarmingly testy
at times. Over a bottle of wine in the
South Australian hotel one night
Campbell admitted to me that he was
an anachronism. ‘I am earth and water
bound,’ he said. ‘Men up there are fly-
ing at twice the speed of sound and out
into space. Well, it’s a new era.’
“I asked whether his land and water
attempts would add anything to future
car and boat design which could not
have been worked out on the drawing
board. He was hesitant. ‘Maybe not
but somebody’s got to try things out,’
was his reply.

record attempts cost Campbell and his
sponsors. Some put a figure at $5
million, but Campbell would not say

No Dutch Uncle
IN THE WAKE of David McCallum’s
ill-fated visit to Australia over the New
Year, the publicist for “The Man From
U.N.C.L.E.,” special projects producer
for MGM, Gene Webster, stopped in
Sydney and found time to talk to us
about the series. It is mostly directed
by veterans: George Waggner, who
made some bizarre features at Universal
during- the 1940 s (“The Wolf Man,”
“Phantom of the Opera,” “The
Climax”), Otto Lang, brother of the
famous Fritz, John Brahm, brilliant
director of “The Lodger” and “Hang-
over Square,” and Joe Sargent. “We
make the series at a murderous sche-
dule,” Mr. Webster said. “Six days a
week, starting with a 7 a.m. call each
day. A one-hour break for lunch, and
then on as long as needs be, often until
7.30 at night. Finally, when the actors
and directors get home they have to
study the script for the next day.
“No, we have no rehearsals. The
director comes in straight on to the
set, and we have a brief run-through
with the camera while the cast walk
through the set. A stunt man works out
the routines involving fist fights.
“Then we plunge in. And it’s very
dangerous. For instance, we use air-
powered rifles with bullets of fuller’s
earth instead of lead. These can strike
very close to Robert Vaughn or David
on a wall. Bob has a punctured ear-
drum through this, and very nearly lost
the hearing in his good ear. In one
episode, ‘The Supercolossal Affair,’
David was carried on a conveyer belt
to a huge vat of plaster of paris. We
had to have five guys to rush in and
pull him out when he fell into it, but
the camera still showed the plaster of
paris closing over his head. If the five
men had been a fraction too late . . .”
Mr. Webster gave what has been des-
cribed as an eloquent shrug. “But it’s
all in a day’s work for Bob and David
. . . while Bob was hanging from a
hook in one episode, he’s reading a
magazine up there waiting for the
camera. A moment later he’s headed
for a bubbling vat. No one can get in-
surance. They’re being blown up, when
all is said and done, every five
minutes.”
“They certainly earn their money,”
Mr. Webster concluded with a thank-
heaven-it’s-not-me look on his face.

Traffic Jams on Our Waterways
By FRANK McNULTY
Australians as a race have
turned seriously to sailing in the
past few years, and at the
moment, with about 160,000 of them on
the water at weekends, sailing is the
national boom pastime.
For many who have turned to the
water the choice has been not entirely
voluntary. They have been pushed to-
ward the sea by the congestion of our
roads, which has made the enjoyment
of leisure-time driving, once the weekly
escape, almost an impossibility.
These people now are discovering
the next most convenient zone for
weekend enjoyment is the sea. (Their
choice is being followed by the people
of several overseas countries which have
roads as choked as ours.)
The pessimists perhaps they are
the realists say that at the rate Aus-
tralians are pouncing on this new
leisure pastime our waterways will be-
come almost as crowded as the roads
within ten years.
Of course, our traffic-ridden roads
are only part of the reason for this.
Most Australians live near water;
Australia has some of the safest water-
ways of the world; sailing craft have
become cheap to buy; the opportunity
to learn to sail through clubs and sail-
ing schools is abundant; and owning a
sailboat bestows some special standing.
I believe that of far more impact is
that sailing has become a family thing.
It provides opportunities for “together-
ness,” which the car, even in the heyday
of the Sunday picnic-drive, could never
match. With a modest craft costing
$3OO, dad, mum, and the two children
can all adventure together. They can
potter about or they can race. And
each one can play an important part
in a way he never could in the car,
where dad does all the driving and
mum tries to keep the kids quiet in
the back seat.
In Sydney’s Rose Bay there is
Woollahra Sailing Club. Two hundred
craft go out from this club at week-
ends, treble the number it had three

Woollahra’s success (officials are
embarrassed because the club is now
bursting at the seams) is in its adopt-
tion of an lift. 3in. sailboat for family
sailing and racing. This is the Heron.

Gretel for the America’s Cup. He is at
present in training with the squad from
which Gretel’s crew for this year’s
America’s Cup will be chosen. In 1948
he set out from England with one com-
panion as crew in a 24ft. yacht and
sailed across the Atlantic and the
Pacific to Tahiti a voyage that no
craft of that size had accomplished
before.
The American boat Nam Sang at the
start of the 1966 Sydney-Hobart
yacht race
Herons. Today it has more than 60
housed there and it has had to restrict
their entry.
Throughout Australia, 2000 Herons
sail, making them the biggest single
class in the country, three times the
number of the next largest class
(Moth).
Herons in Australia numbered 200 in
1962. In the past four years they have
increased tenfold. Why? They have
ideally fulfilled the need for a cheap
(from $450 new, S3OO secondhand)
family sailboat. In them youngesters of
five years of age and people over 60
learn to sail, and most today are sailed
with a combination of adult and child
crew.
A number of other excellent sailing
craft have played their part in coping
with our sailing boom, but it is the
Heron which best indicates the boom
and the extent of numbers of Aus-
tralian familes taking to the y/ater.
One result of our overall new breed
of sailors is a changed attitude to the
sport’s traditions. Cone are the days
when the sailing man sneered at the
powerboat man, and rivalry between the
two groups was fierce. Perhaps the rea-
son is because we are all motor minded
today we drive cars. The people
afloat today realise that an engine in its
right place is very handy.
The attitude of boatbuilding is
changing, too. Not so long ago most
of our craft were the work of indi-
vidual boatbuilders who translated de-
signs in their mind into reality by rule
of thumb. Today’s boat designers are
specialists, trained naval architects —-
Alan Payne, who created Gretel and a
host of successful ocean racers, Warwick
Hood, once Payne’s protege, who pro-
duced the new 12-metre Dame Pattie.
De Havilland, where Alan Payne now
works, have been churning out alu-
minium power and sailboats in the
small range. This month they have
turned to production line building of
slightly larger fibreglass craft. There
are other large firms doing much the
same, and soon someone will begin
making cabined family sailing craft of
20ft. to 30ft. in much the same way
as our family Holdens and Fords are
produced.
An estimate of the boat-building
industry is that 1500 sailing craft were
launched in 1959. Their estimate for
1966 is 4000, and this new year is cer-
tain to top that, perhaps reach 5000.
Behind this boom, and not as a result
of it, is another factor which is con-
siderably publicising the sport. This is
the extraordinary success of Australians
competing in international sailing races,
success that has occurred in only the
past few years.
Australia must be rated among the
top three sailing nations of the world.
In 1962 Gretel, racing in Australia’s
first challenge for the America’s Cup,
considered the trophy for world yacht-
ing supremacy, was defeated by
Weatherly of the United States in cir-
cumstances which suggested that only
the Australians’ complete inexperience
in 12-metre yachts thwarted them of
victory. In 1964 at the Tokyo
Olympics, 60-year-old Australian Bill
Northam won our first gold medal. It
was in the elite 5.5-metre class.
In 1965 Australians tried for the first
time in a series of events considered
the world championship for ocean rac-
ing yachts, the Admiral’s Cup. The
races were held in Britain, and we were
narrowly beaten into second place.
There have been other Australian
triumphs against the best overseas
sailors. The Flying Dutchmen: we won
a world title recently. The 5055: three
world titles. Adelaide-born Jim Hardy
took out the 1966 world title, and in
the process defeated Paul Elvstrom,
four-time Olympic gold medal winner
from Denmark.
And 1967 could be Australia’s most
magnificent year yet internationally.
We challenge again for the America’s
Cup and for the Admiral’s Cup. We
challenge again for the world cata-
maran title which narrowly escaped
Australia in its first two attempts.
Even so, Australian sailors have only
just begun to test themselves in the
international arena. We live a long way
away from the rest of the yachting
world Europe and the United States.

Even today the cost of sending a sail-
ing craft and its crew overseas to com-
pete is a severe handicap, out of all
proportion to the cost to other nations
taking part in these races.
It is being overcome. Sir Frank
Packer and some business friends spon-
sored our first challenge for the
America’s Cup in 1962. Sir Frank is
expected to pay the enormous costs
involved in sending Gretel and her
crew to the United States again this
year, where she will first race against
Dame Pattie, sponsored by Melbourne
businessmen, to decide which of the
two will represent Australia against the
United States. The Australian company
of Rothmans helped with the money
to send our first Admiral’s Cup ocean
racing yachts abroad in 1965. Roth-
mans have given SIO,OOO toward the
expenses of the second Admiral’s Cup
team which will be shipped to England
this year. Club support and even pub-
lic subscription have helped send our
boats and crews away.
There are other clouds in Australia’s
sailing horizon. The multiplicity of the
classes craft on our waters is one. Each
season three or four new designs are
introduced and begin to race here.
There is some good in this, because
each new class fulfils a need, perhaps
in purchase price or in its suitability
for a particular locality. But the num-
ber of these different classes is grow-
ing and growing.
RAILING people who look ahead see
in this a fragmenting of our strength
and potential. They would rather we
concentrated our interest on the
Olympic and other types of craft which
are raced by the major overseas yacht-
ing nations and which Australians must
use when they compete internationally.
“Professionalism” is another bugbear
for Australians. The people who race
18-footers and 16-footers are, through
a recent re-emphasis of the Olympic
amateurism rule, debarred for all time
from Olympic competition. These
classes race for prizemoney so nominal
that a successful craft would earn
barely more than its boatshed rent in
a season, but because money is involved
each and every person who competes in
a race for prizemoney is out, out of the
Olympics for life.
The tragedy is that most successful
Australian skippers today graduated
from these classes. The stern restate-
ment of the amateur rule by the Inter-
national Olympic Committee seems to
deprive Australia of any of these crew-
men and skippers for Olympic compe-
tition in the future.
The blackest of clouds on our sail-
ing horizon today is congestion of fore-
shore facilities and on the waterways
themselves.
Time is on a pretty fast tide. If you
feel this new opportunity to “escape”
at weekends, and with your family if
you like it that way, don’t leave it too
long. Another ten years, even five, may
find us with the sea lanes studded with
traffic lights and a water-borne cop
behind every second wave.


Finding out About Mr. Blain
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
Ellis manning blain has
been talking for a living on ABC,
one way or another, for nigh on
30 years. He enjoys talking, he says, and
this is apparent to anyone who cares to
switch on the radio Monday to Friday
at 9.30 a.m. when, prefaced by the
signature tune “Waltz of the Cuckoos”
and in the company of a female (his
word), his actor-ish voice delivers
opinions and comment on a program
called “Let’s Find Out.” He can also be
heard most Sundays on “Away From
It All,” when he interviews people on
a kind of Desert Island Disc program.
Talking to Mr. Blain is difficult. A
five-second question could easily bring
forth a five-minute reply; in fact, the
writer is still reeling from her planned
20-minute interview which turned into
one lasting an hour and a half. This
surprised even Mr. Blain. Next day
she experienced the extraordinary sen-
sation of hearing the Blain voice boom-
ing from her radio in the kitchen while
it was talking at her on the telephone
in the sitting-room.
“Let’s Find Out” is recorded a day
in advance, fairly late in the afternoon
in order to retain as much topicality as
possible. Originally, says Mr. Blain,
the conception was that he should work
with one female permanently five days
a week. This was changed not very
long before the program went on the air
because they could not find the right
female. The idea then was to choose
from a selection, but it was obvious after
a couple of weeks that they had the
perfect formula of four regulars and
a Friday guest.
Mr. Blain rightly said, “You’d never
get in one woman Dita Cobb’s wit and
sense of humor, Coral Lansbury’s in-
tellectual brilliance, Diana Fisher’s
effervescence, Claire Dunne’s Irish
charm.”
He considers the program’s title tot-
ally inappropriate. They were going
to report subjects about which they
knew nothing, then go off and find
something about them and air the re-
sults the following day, but that was
changed, too. He could see no reason
why the title should be altered now,
however, after 15 months.
Mr. Blain motors 25 miles each day
from his home in Clareville Beach to
the ABC studio at Upper Forbes Street,
Sydney, bearing with him the results of
his homework for LFO, about four or
five subjects which he discusses with
the Female of the Day, who, in turn,
also contributes four or five. “We don’t
pretend to be experts, we don’t discuss
things as experts. The ABC has plenty
of experts to call on. All I’m concerned
with is to make people think.” He is
not worried if his opinions influence
people and says listeners are perfectly
free to disagree and form their own
opinions.
The source of his homework varies.
From five to seven percent comes from
the daily Press, some from discussion
with people he meets (“I draw on their
brains on a particular subject”), some
from American and English newspapers
and well-known magazines. He con-
sidered it an unfair charge that people
complained they didn’t want to turn
from their own just-read newspapers to
hear Mr. Blain reread them on the air.
“If it is necessary to read a news item
only the minimum is used. After all, we
go out to every State except Victoria,
and you can’t tell me everyone has read
every news item by then.”
“LET’S Find Out” ratings are good,
claims Mr. Blain, but he was not at
liberty to say how good. If they went
too high, though, that would be the
time he would re-examine himself, but
this was not to be taken, he clarified
the following day, that he denigrated
in any way competitors’ high ratings.
(The writer made a note that it must
be agony working for the ABC.) He
was at liberty to say, however, that
“Let’s Find Out” is aimed at “the
majority of married women with chil-
dren who have had a reasonably good
education, have an active mind, and are
cut off from their natural mental
stimulation by the restriction of chil-
dren, by the restriction of home and
not being able to move around freely
although it is also for men: taxi-
drivers, market gardeners, for instance,
and doctors in their cars going from
patient to patient on their rounds.”
Unlike “Let’s Find Out,” Mr.
Blain’s other verbal outlet, “Away From
It All,” is sometimes edited or, rather,
toned down. This does away with
long pauses, or urns and ers. He finds
this program more complicated because
he must (1) concentrate all the time
and (2) keep to one subject for an
hour. He makes more comprehensive
notes because he is never sure how the
interview will go. Roughly, the way
he works is to get the person chatting
for, say, two or three minutes, during
which time he decides which lead he
will follow and which he will ignore.
The qualifications for appearing
with Mr. Blain on this program are
that guests should either have an inter-
esting story to tell, or be well known.
Preferably they should comply with
both. There is a dreadful shortage of
suitable applicants, and for this reason
“Away From It All” runs in quarterly
series.
The writer, for reasons no longer
clear to her and probably neither to
Mr. Blain, recorded an AFIA recently.
It took about 75 minutes to record
the session during which there was one
minor disaster when Mr. Blain repeated
a question and shouted “STOP—CUT
THAT!” He said it was the first
AFIA he had done in three months
and he hadn’t got back into the swing
of it yet. The last on Lew Hoad was
done before he went overseas, and that
had been easy. Boing-boing from one
question to the next. No, people
weren’t often unsure. Sir Charles
Moses had been completely in com-
mand of the situation. When asked
if he thought he’d made any mistakes
during his 29 years as general manager
of the ABC, he had said “No” straight
away. Later Mr. Blain said he would
never deliberately put a leading ques-
tion to anyone, and he had not been
aware that anyone had made a fool of
him—it would be more likely that he
would make a fool of himself.
In all fifty-to-sixty “Away From It
All” Mr. Blain recalls two below
average programs, but has never aban-
doned one. The writer supposes there
is always the first time.
The Long, Long Trail
By APRIL HERSEY
Australians are a restless lot.
In the recent Federal election
there was concern about the seat
of Evans where 14,000 out of the 40,000
people voting had come there from
somewhere else during the three years
between the elections. They had re-
placed others now probably scattered
across the continent.
A continuous upheaval and trans-
planting seems to go on —an ant-like
activity without the ant’s purposeful-
ness. For a great many of these moves
seem to be the result of traditional
attitudes.
Teachers are prime movers, bankers
move, pastoral company people move,
expanding companies move their key
personnel, young executives for the
chainstores move, engineers and pro-
ject workers move from site to site,
and, of course, the armed forces move
from spot A to spot B with regular
precision. Only a few ever question the
necessity of moving.
Primary Staffing Officer Dr. J. R.
Joyce at the N.S.W. Department of
Education, at present in the throes of
working out how best to move thous-
ands of teachers about in his perpetual
game of put and take around the
State, which reaches its peak anxiety
period in the Christmas holidays, sums
it all up when he says, “Well, everyone
doesn’t want to go to Goodooga in
north-west New South Wales. Every-
one actually wants to go to Manly.”
Fluttering perpetually over his head
and the heads of the other staffing
officers are the four official lists on
which are the names of the 30,000
teachers in the State. These lists give


priority, so that years of service, ex-
perience, and training all count.
It is possible to “get up the list” by
asking for transfers “west of the line”
a sinister name for the heatwave dis-
tricts of the west. Here among the
mulga and tiny classrooms ambitious
teachers literally sweat their way to
promotion. Every effort is made to be
fair in the movement of teachers. Com-
passion for family problems and illness
is all taken into consideration, but
every year for one reason or another
one-tenth of the teachers in primary
and high schools throughout the whole
country will take up their books and
move somewhere else to a vacancy
which has been left by the transfer of
another teacher.
The annual brain swop around the
nation seems fair enough, considering
the nature of the country and the
great variations of climate, though it
also seems a great waste of energy
and a continual drain on the vitality
of the school system.
Some teachers manage to stay in one
place. There is the case of the bright
High School student who went on to
Teacher’s College, went on to take a
degree, returned to his old High
School, taught throughout his life there
and finished up as_the Principal. But he
is an unusual example. Generally, they
are more like the middle-aged teacher
who moaned: “Every time I get my
garden right, and put down concrete
paths, I am offered a position I can’t
refuse and I have to sell up.” Too
many refusals put the prospect “down
the list” instead of up.
'J'HE business of renting or buying
houses is a consideration for the
travelling ones. Some teachers like to
buy a house and sell it hoping for a
profit. They usually have a chance of
selling it to the next man. It is the
same with the armed forces. Unless
they have to live “on the base” they
often like to buy a house, to gain per-
haps a sense of permanence, and cer-
tainly to put their rent money into
something which will eventually give
a return.
Bankers and other similar businesses
justify their nomadic attitude toward
their people by claiming that constant
movement is essential for experience.
“A banker must understand all the in-
tricacies of business. He must have a
thorough knowledge of country areas
as well as the city. He must know
wheat, wool, coal, and so forth,” ac-
cording to a spokesman for the Bank
Officers’ Association.
But one wonders if he need know
much more than dollars and cents and
if it isn’t rather a nervous dread that
a Bank Manager may finish up as unof-
ficial Prime Minister of the town if he
stays there too long, or, worse still, part-
owner of the entire place.
Certainly, it seems rather hard that
bank people, and headmasters alike
are expected to join in local affairs
with enthusiasm, only to be whisked
away after a few years, when they have
begun to know all the people and under-
stand all the problems. Surely an ac-
countant born and raised in Maitland
should know more about that district
than a fresh lad from Collaroy trying
to understand the country. It may be
good experience for the man from Col-
laroy, but how about the Maitland
people?
So much of this movement is moti-
vated by the employers, who dangle the
carrots of promotion before their em-
ployees without really much purpose.
The blind acceptance that it is essential
could surely be questioned more often.
But the long, long trail will go wind-
ing on for the clergy, the teachers, the
railway people, and for that unfortu-
nate specimen “the bright young man”
in any business who may have millions
of miles to traverse before he finally
gets a seat on the board.
Mind and Heart at War
“Nicer than her writing suggests ”
SOME novelists dislike people, and
their books show it. But Iris
Murdoch, Fellow of St. Anne’s
College, Oxford, whose ninth novel
appeared in 1966, is really much nicer
than her writing suggests. Miss Mur-
doch and her husband, John Bayley,
will come to Perth next month to take
part in a writers’ conference with the
theme “The Literature of Revolt.”
Pupils, colleagues, and friends are
devoted to her. She is retiring and un-
pretentious, with a rare and warm-
hearted concern for individuals. If she
has not put her full humanity into
her books, it is due partly to an im-
perfect technique in drawing character
and perhaps partly to emotional dif-
fidence. Her brilliant, highly organised
analytical mind seems to be always at
war with her warm, irrational Irish
heart. This tension makes her a
novelist. It also causes some faults
in the books, which in recent years
have emphasised a Gothic-romantic
mode and have suffered mixed recep-
tions from critics.
For more than 18 years she has
spent a quiet, orderly, and hard-working
life that has little in common either
with the garish underworld of her first
books, the decadent, sophisticated
milieu of novels like “A Severed
Head,” or the more Gothic settings
of recent books.
She is reticent, will rarely talk about
her writing unless pressed, and is quite
unspoilt by success. At 47, she is
now a best seller, has been translated
into several languages, and has been
called “the best novelist of her genera-
tion.” But she is not interested in
reviews of her books, rarely reads them,
and when she does seems unaffected by
bad ones.
She is soft-voiced and courteous, with
an open manner and a large capacity
for sympathetic listening, which she
prefers to talking. Her gentleness goes
with a certain natural authority and
decisiveness. Her pink cheeks with
bright eyes and a mop of honey-
colored hair give her a youthful look,
enhanced by unorthodox clothes and
schoolgirl jargon. “Hello, old thing,”
“blokes,” and “cheerio” are as much
a part of her language as are Oxford
semantics. She dresses for comfort—
woolly jerseys, tweeds, and wide skirts
—and hates dressing up for a party.
But she chooses her clothes carefully
and with pleasure, aided by her hus-
band. He is John Bay ley, a brilliant
and pleasantly eccentric young Eng. Lit.
don at New College, to whom she has
been married since 1956.
She was born in Dublin, the only
child of upper middle-class Anglo-Irish
parents, and was brought up, conven-
tionally, in Hammersmith and Chis-
wick. London means a lot to her,
as she shows in her first published
novel, “Under the Net” (1954). After
public school (Badminton) she went
up to Somerville in 1938 and took a
First in “Greats.” She was noted in
college as an outstanding personality.'
She was also, for a while, an active
Communist, like many other intellec-
tuals of the ’thirties, but soon became
disillusioned and left the Party.
Iris Murdoch
In 1942 she followed her father
into the Civil Service and joined the
Treasury staff, but gave it up two
years later, wanting to do active war
work. She served with UNRRA in
refugee camps in Belgium and Austria.
In Brussels, she was infected by the
fever of existentialism sweeping from
liberated Paris, and this has marked
her, even though, like others, she has
since outgrown its ideas. Her first
published work, in 1953, was a brilliant
monograph on Sartre. A French critic
once described “The Bell” as “the
first great existentialist novel,” saying

that “grace a I’humeur anglais” Mur-
doch has succeeded where Sartre and
de Beauvoir had failed!
In 1946 she won a scholarship in
philosophy to the United States, but
as an ex-Communist could not get a
visa. So she “hung around London
reading Kant” and haunting the pubs
of Soho, made several trips to existen-
tialist Paris and spent a year at Cam-
bridge in the shadow of the great
philosopher Wittgenstein before finally
settling at St. Anne’s in 1948. This
period, 1946-1948, was vitally forma-
tive.
She had the reputation then of a
striking, mysterious, free-thinking girl
who was writing novels which no one
had seen. She had decided to be a
novelist at the age of ten, and wrote
her first book while at the Treasury.
“Under the Net” (1954), the first to be
published, was in fact the sixth to be
written. She was self-critical enough
to suppress all the earlier efforts, save
one that was rejected by Faber, and
she now regards them all as “terrible
junk, too personal.”
S™ is still secretive about her books
until they are finished and does not
discuss therri even with her husband,
though his ideas on literature influence
her a good deal. She usually spends
months working out the plot of a
novel, then writes fast.
She has been drawn increasingly to-
ward the large, rambling novel of
character, in the manner of Tolstoy or
George Eliot, and feels the main con-
flict in her work to be between this
and the need for a neat, concise form.
She much prefers 19th-century novels
to modern ones and believes that the
novel must rediscover a sense of human
character.
She rarely reads modern writers, and
has very few of them among her
friends, save three rather older than
herself: Raymond Oueneau, the avant-
garde author of “Zazie dans le Metro,”
Elias Canetti, an Austrian exile living
in Hampstead, and J. B. Priestley.
(Priestley helped her dramatise “A
Severed Head.”) Literary politics and
fashions mean nothing to her. Her
close friends are widely assorted—one
is a Roman Catholic priest of Egyptian-
Jewish origin who runs a parish near
Rome, while others are quite ordinary
people.
It could be argued that she ought
to be out in the tough world, seeing
her liberal ideals in Action, and that
this might help solve some of the prob-
lems of her writing. But this is not
how novelists usually work. She loves
Oxford and, maybe, with some money
and leisure to travel, its sheltered walls
are still the best setting for her. There
she can go on working, in her own way,
at the problem of creating complete
characters within her own style, of
harmonising the conflict between heart
and mind. And she is ambitious
enough, for all her disdain of worldly
success, to want to write a really great
novel one day.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
A Sounding Brass
By APRIL HERSEY
THE growing popularity of John
Robertson, trumpeter extraordin-
ary of the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra, has come sharply into focus
with the release of his latest RCA LP
record, “Sugar ’n’ Spice,” which sold
1500 copies in less than a month. At
the pre-Christmas season of Handel’s
at the Town Hall the
younger section of the audience were
much more interested in Robertson’s
trumpet than in the religious message.
After he played, the young ones left.
“I wondered what was happening for
a moment,” he said. “Then I realised
they were probably my record fans.”
A big red-headed New Zealander,
John Robertson has released only a
handful of records, but has won both
radio and Press awards for the “Best
Australian instrumental recording” for
both 1964 and 1965. He is conserva-
John Robertson
tively regarded as one of the ten finest
trumpeters in the world.
His love for band music began when
he was very young and heard the town
band playing. Unable to explain the
impact of the brassy sound, he ran
home to his mother crying: “They hit
me. The band people hit me!” Before
long he was hiding a pair of drums
behind the kitchen door. Later he
graduated to the band and tried out on
the biggest thing he could find, the
flugelhorn. There were 18 young re-
cruits to the band, but only Robertson
was still there at the end of two years.
His father was a baker, and also the
mayor of Westport, and was very keen
on racing. When he enjoyed a spec-
tacular win he bought his son a gold-
and-silver cornet, and young John was
on his \yay to becoming the champion
of champions in competition playing.
He won 15 medals in all over five
years and was invited to play at the
Capitol Theatre in Melbourne.
After two years he decided to try
his luck in England. He began playing
at a theatre which had the confused
name of the Stratford Broadway, but
the job was not a happy choice. Robert-
son broke away and auditioned for the
famous St. Hilda Colliery Band. He
chose Rimner’s “Hail Storm,” making
the management sit up in astonishment
because he played without music. “At
that time,” he recalls, “British bands-
men would look at the spots if they
had to play ‘God Save the King.’ I
was very impressive.”
He went on to tour Canada with the
Colliery Band, and made some record-
ings with the Jack Mclntosh group.
This led to a position with the Bertram
Mills Olympia Circus, which gave so
many performances that Robertson
paralysed his lip. He was frantic in
case the damage was permanent, but
some weeks later, after treatment, the
nerves relaxed and he was able to play
again.
Realising he had to slacken the pace
needed for three shows a day work, he
auditioned for the Toronto Symphony
Orchestra and joined them as principal
trumpet.
But Canada was very cold, and
Robertson returned to England. Here
he gave recitals for the BBC, featuring
trumpet, cornet, and posthorn. He
toured England and the Continent with
the BBC dance band under bandleader
Jack Payne. Later he played with the
dynamic Teddy Joyce. At this point he
had been six years away from home,
and he began to long for a warmer
climate.
He returned to New Zealand, where
he toured for the New Zealand Broad-
casting Board. Additionally he went
out on the roads again for six months
with Gladys Moncrieff. But he found
that Australia offered more scope, and
crossed to Melbourne to be principal
trumpet under Sir Eugene Goossens
with the Melbourne Symphony
Orchestra. Later he came up to Syd-
ney, and after a brief time swinging
away with Frank Coughlan’s Band at
the Trocadero he became principal
trumpet for the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra, a position he still holds.
11l health has prevented him from
accepting opportunities to play in some
of the finest orchestras in the world.
“My doctor assures me I must be work-
ing on a second circulatory system,”
he said. “I’ve had three major opera-
tions for ulcers, and also for pancreas
trouble, which means they have cut
through the diaphragm so no one
knows what I’m using to blow with
now. But I do know I can’t stand cold
and smog.”
It is to Australia’s advantage that
he can’t. This remarkably versatile
artist can turn from complicated sym-
phonic music to the swinging Dixie
sound without missing a note. His
records, which are now selling in Spain,
France, England, Venezuela, and all
the South American States, New Zea-
land, Canada, and possibly in the near
future America as well, are making
many of the world’s trumpeters sound
very tinny.
Robertson lives for his work, though
he plays golf with great success, too,
holding the Albert Park record score
of 68. But he admits that his house is
full of trumpets. “They are even under
the bed.” For 11 hours each week he
teaches youngsters at the Conserva-
torium. “I have 22 pupils,” he said.
“How’s that for an indication that we
need another orchestra in Sydney!”
John Robertson is no snob about
talent. He is happy to be involved
with great professionals and classical
music, but at this year’s Adelaide Fes-
tival he left his dinner to follow the
local Salvation Army band. When
some of his fellow orchestra members
found him he was unembarrassed to
be seen walking after the band with
tears of emotion pouring down his face.
“It was a very good band,” he said.
ART
Wide Open Spaces
in the Space Age
SIX months it is since Dr. Coombs*
recommendations for subsidising
the performing arts lobbed on the
Prime Minister’s desk; buried near it,
no doubt, are the proposals of the com-
mittee, appointed by the Common-
wealth Art Advisory Board, which is
in the PM’s Department, on a national
gallery at Canberra. It is natural to
look where the money is, but a cen-
tralisation of the arts which does not
preserve peripheral autonomies, which
does not give cultural bodies, however
small, some sense of participation in
artistic achievement, and which does not
avoid reducing the public to a passive
consumer, is doomed to charges of
didacticism and financial dictatorship.
The Art Advisory Board is not an
initiatory body; it makes recommen-
dations on expenditure for circulating
shows arranged by others and for par-
ticipation in overseas exhibitions like
the Venice Biennale, where 37 coun-
tries, but not Australia, were represented
in 1966. The CAAB has no consistent
policy on overseas participation: its
policy has ranged from refusal to par-
ticipate and misunderstanding of what
the Biennale means to the annus mira
bitis of 1954 when Sidney Nolan was
both participant and Australian Com-
missioner. Since the commencement of
the Young Painters’ Biennale in Paris
in 1958, the Board has twice partici-


pated, once disastrously and once in a
way that brought honor to Charles
Blackman and Brett Whiteley.
The Board has little sense of respon-
sibility and it is only by accident or
repeated inquiry that one learns of its
decisions: in 1961 the Contemporary
Art Society heard from Sao Paulo that
CAAB was not participating in that
city’s Bienal and got permission to send
an exhibition. In 1963 the Board did
participate and Lawrence Daws won an
international medal. The Board has
little notion of how such participation
enlivens the morale of artists and,
worse, it shows no inclination to delegate
its powers, even when it doesn’t cost
a cent.
Participation abroad is not nearly so
important as the circulation of overseas
exhibitions within Australia; in this the
Board is inhibited by its taste (the
members are Sir Daryl Lindsay, Robert
Campbell, William Dargie, Russell
Drysdale, and Douglas Pratt), by its
dependence on the attitudes and policies
of State directors, and by a sense of
Commonwealth responsibility that in-
clines it to think that showing an
exhibition in two capitals only is not
justified. In late 1964, State directors
and the CAAB were told of a magni-
ficent U.S. exhibition from Pollock to
Warhol destined for Tokyo in 1966.
Sydney might see the exhibition in April
owing to the activities of a few indi-
viduals; certainly the Board’s reluctance
and procrastination are not unknown in
America.
Obviously there is need for an inquiry
into the operation of such exhibitions:
in September, 1965, the U.S. Congress
This summer successful theatre in
Sydney often is found anywhere ex-
cept between the four walls of the
conventional theatre. It is at the beach

ereaux and Rosalind Keene at Sydney’s

passed the National Foundation on the
Arts and Humanities Act as the result
of a long inquiry. Though it linked art
and democracy in a way to make Rem-
brandt, Bunyan, and Cervantes smile,
it declared, “While no government can
call a great artist or scholar into exis-
tence, it is necessary and appropriate
for the Federal Government to help
create and sustain not only a climate
encouraging freedom of thought,
imagination, and inquiry, but also the
material conditions facilitating the
release of this creative talent.”
The Act had been preceded by
Jennie Lee’s White Paper of February,
1965, in England, on “A Policy for the
Arts.” She was worried about London
as the great artistic wen and the decay
of the provinces where there were in-
sufficient buildings to show what bodies
like the Arts Council circulated. The
Paper contained a sentence to be read
out at every meeting of any inquiry
on the arts: “No one would wish
State patronage to dictate taste or in
any way restrict the liberty of even the
most unorthodox and experimental of
artists.”
In N.S.W., which is not blessed with
Victoria’s array of regional galleries,
the almost übiquitous art contest
reveals rural concerl and frustration
about the visual arts. Country centres
usually see only Australian art, which
incontestably it is the duty of State gal-
leries to supply, but the Commonwealth
should be responsible for the circula-
tion of those dozens of small shows
not expensive or difficult to organise
available from Europe and America,
but often of only marginal concern for
large city galleries.
In the light of the establishment of
a National Gallery at Canberra, the
role of CAAB will have to be
reorientated and even if 1967 looks a
better year (but no thanks to CAAB)
an inquiry is due: to circulate are
Rodin and His Contemporaries, aspects
of Recent British Art, Sidney Nolan’s
retrospective, and the Stuyvesant show
of Kinetic and Op Art called Art of
the Space Age; no one wants boards
full of artistic astronauts, but there
is room for people who feel at home
in the Space Age a depressing
cliche, but no worse than “the wide
open spaces,” the only subject for real
Australian painters, no doubt.
ELWYN LYNN
FILMS
Close to Home
Juliet of the Spirits. Director, Federico
Fellini.
FELLINI is probably the world’s
most self-centred director: his
interests have never strayed far
from his own life, and his films are now
blatantly autobiographical. When he
felt that his inspiration was flagging,
he made “BJ,” a brilliantly successful
film about a director who felt that his
inspiration was flagging. Now in the
face of rumors that his marriage to
actress Giulietta Masina is, to say the
least, uneasy, he gives us a film about a
woman called Giulietta suffering a
crise de nerfs because of the uncer-
tainty of her marriage to a handsome,
successful man.
There is something rather disarming
about the sincerity of Fellini’s convic-
tion that whatever interests him is of
interest, and fortunately he is a vital
and interesting man, and even when
his ideas are trivial they are almost
always stylishly presented. “Juliet of
the Spirits” won’t give you any revolu-
tionary new ideas about life and the
human heart, but it presents the old
and tried ones with extraordinary
novelty and grace, decorated (some-
times overloaded) with ornate and
imaginative embellishments.
Giulietta is an unassuming woman
deeply in love with her glamorous,
successful husband, deeply aware of
her own inadequacy—a feeling accen-
tuated by the affectionate scorn shown
her by her mother and sisters and her
glossy friends. Suspecting that her
husband’s neglect and absences may not
all be due to pressure of business, she
unavailingly seeks help—from spiritu-
alists, private detectives, psychiatry,
and her own dream fantasies. Nothing
avails, until the dreaded event—her
husband’s desertion of her —actually
happens and proves to be her salvation:
at last Giulietta knows that she not
only must but can rely on herself.
The suddenness of this revelation is
Theatre in a hotel-restaurant. Colin Croft as Mercury and Eric Reiman as
Jupiter in Cole Porter’s “Out of This World” at Menzies, Sydney.


a major weakness in the film, as was
the abrupt conclusion of “8J”; it leaves
less a sense of revelation than a sus-
picion that Fellini’s iridescent, dragon-
fly imagination has tired of this subject
and darted off in another direction.
Fellini’s psychology is basic-Freudian,
rather old-fashioned, and his symbo-
lism is always simple and obvious—
not that this is necessarily a criticism;
symbols so subtle as to be unrecognis-
able as symbols defeat their own end.
But there is a kind of shoddy poetry
in his vision of the world, accurately
echoed in Gianni di Venanzo’s breath-
taking photography.
Most of Fellini’s favorite images
occur during the film. Statuesque
nuns, appearing as faceless, black-clad
figures of frustration and disapproval,
embody his hatred of established
religion; the circus appears to sum up
his views of actual living gaudy,
vulgar, and real. The latter also gives
us one of the film’s most lyrical shots,
when Giulietta’s grandfather (beauti-
fully sketched by Lou Gilbert as the
embodiment of a romantic dream of
freedom) elopes with an opulent bare-
back rider in a dotty aeroplane.
“Juliet” is not perhaps a very im-
portant film, but it is a thoroughly
entertaining and often funny one, and
it gives a master craftsman unbounded
opportunities to show off. Always
lively, invariably beguiling to the eye,
it also manages on occasion to touch
the heart. This is in the main due not
to its director but to Giulietta Masina,
whose performance in the central role
lends a good deal more significance to
the film than its script warrants.

THEATRE
Viewed with
Suspicion
Alice in Wonderland. Lewis Carroll.
Adapted by William Orr. Tivoli,
Sydney.
Peter Pan. J. M. Barrie. Independent,
Sydney.
A Blue Toast Oblivion. Theatre-Dis-
cotheque. Wayside Chapel, Sydney.
EVER since Freud explained that
fables and fairy tales, like dreams
and delusions, are the disguised
expressions of unconscious desires,
either sexual or aggressive, adults have
been inclined to regard children’s litera-
ture with strong but generalised sus-
picion: an attitude like that of police-
men arriving at the scene of the crime.
Any amateur psychoanalyst can see
that “Peter Pan” is suspect. The play
is obsessed with mothers. Peter Pan
lures Wendy to the Never Land so
that she can be “mother” to himself
and the Lost Boys. He is a little boy
who does not want to grow up and
insists that the relationship between
himself and the little girl is strictly
one of mother and son. As if that made
it all right!
“Alice in Wonderland” is much more
challenging to the amateur analyst, for
everything is disguised. There are no
mothers and fathers, only the King and
Queen, no brothers and sisters or aunts
and uncles, only animals and cards. It
seems that Jonathan Miller has trans-
lated all these symbols back into people
in his BBC “Alice in Wonderland.” But
that sort of thing only interests adults.
The Tivoli production remains as
faithful as possible to Lewis Carroll,
within the limitations imposed by the
real world. Kathleen Gorham is very
Alice-like with her long tresses and
Victorian dress and her mixture of
pertness and sweetness. Of course, she
cannot keep expanding and contracting
from nine feet to three inches, but
she can dance, and that is a kind of
magic.
William Orr’s production, with Dot
Mendoza’s music and Ronald Hay’s
choreography, is thoroughly delightful
and should not be missed by any child,
or by any mother, aunt, or grandmother
who can find a child to take. Max
Oldaker, with orange wig and booming
voice, makes a commanding figure as
the Duchess. Michael Boddy lends
weight to the Queen of Hearts, while
Michael Laurence, all protruding teeth
and grin, is an engagingly zany March
Hare.
People who saw “Peter Pan” as
children (which I did not) all say
that what really caught their imagina-
tions was seeing Peter Pan and the
children flying. The disadvantage of
David Goddard’s “Peter Pan” at the
Independent is that, being a shoe-
string production, it has managed only
a token attempt at flying. The play
really needs a more lavish production.
Nevertheless, the excitements of the
plot, with pirates and Indians rushing
around the auditorium, and a really
splendid crocodile, hold the attention
of the children quite successfully. Jacki
Weaver is an attractive Peter Pan.
In the ultra-violet gloom of the cave-
like Theatre-Discotheque, in which
teeth gleam grotesquely phosphores-
cent; beneath the loud and remorseless
beat of the canned music, the non-
dancing audience sits and watches the
hypnotically swaying dancers, and
waits. Suddenly there is shouting, the
dancers scatter, the lights go up, and
it seems there is a brawl. But it is only
the first play beginning, at 9.15 or
thereabouts.
This, “The National Hero and the
Daily Press,” was specially written for
the Theatre-Discotheque by James
Searle, the author of Jane Street’s
“The Lucky Streak.” It is little more
than a revue sketch, but is written and
acted with vigor, especially by Chris
Winzar as Samson, the mindless hero.
After this short sketch the dancing
begins again and one escapes into the
world outside in search of coffee.
The second offering, at 10.15, is
“Woyzeck,” an unfinished play by the
German dramatist Georg Buchner, who
died in 1837. It is a scamped produc-
tion, crowded on the tiny stage without
scenery and hurried through so that
the dancing can begin again.
Finally, at 11.30, there is a new
playlet from England: “Local Stig-
matic,” by Heathcote Williams. It
begins in a Pinterish atmosphere of
undefined menace, with two spiv-like
youths discussing the dog races.
Gradually it builds up to a scene of
cooly sadistic violence in which the
two brutally kick and then carve a
Jewish matinee idol.
According to the Theatre-Disco-
theque it is “a controversial, searching
look at our sick society.” Not having
read the text I cannot say with cer-
tainty, but in this production by Rick
Billinghurst it was the play that seemed
sick.
The Theatre-Discotheque is a
rigorous night’s entertainment, obviously
designed only for the young and
strong.
MADELEINE ARMSTRONG

1 WORRY about St. Martin’s. The
mean age of their audience would
be the highest attending any public
entertainment in Victoria, community
singing at Prahran Town Hall, or the
occasional hanging at Pentridge in-
cluded. And it’s always seemed they’ve
only had their choice of plays to blame.
Take the current offering. According
to my trusty “Pear’s ’Cyclopedia,” it
had its premiere the year King Ludwig
of Bavaria suicided, Queen Victoria
had her jubilee, and Stanley set out on
the Emir Pasha Relief Expedition.
But after I talked to director Peter
Randall it seems that St. Martin’s pro-
gramming reflects not so much a pen-
chant for the past as a struggle with
the present. Apparently, the Elizabethan
snaps up all the contemporary U.S.
and U.K. goodies as soon as they
emerge, reserving them for the theatres
under their patronage.
This being the case, “Dandy Dick”
isn’t such a bad play to bring down
from the attic. When it came to writing
farces, Sir Arthur wielded a deft quill,
and having introduced the vices of
horse racing and moral duplicity to the
Deanery, he handles the resulting non-
sense very cleverly indeed.
George Fairfax’s cast (Moira Carle-
ton, David Spurling, Nevil Thurgood,
Keith Lee, etc.) are nothing if not en-
thusiasts, and Paul Kathner provides
them with a pleasant environment of
plush, cabriole, and Gothic revival.
But I toss restlessly in my seat on
opening nights worrying about St.
Martin’s. Perhaps their answer lies in
linking up with the theatres like the
Ensemble in Sydney, so as to form a
play-buying syndicate that can com-
pete with Dr. Coombs. The choice
seems anti-Trust legislation or octoge-
narians.

BOOKS
The Finger of Gold
By GEOFFREY LEHMANN
The Life of lan Fleming. John Pear-
son. Cape. $4.60.
THE gold-spattered black dust-
jacket of this sumptuously pro-
duced biography of lan Fleming
makes outrageous claims: among them
that Fleming was engaged in activities
as exciting as James Bond’s. Mr.
Pearson’s book makes no such claim.
But the book does make it clear that
Fleming poured a lot of himself into
James Bond.
Fleming was as obsessed with gad-
gets: he drove a Thunderbird, thought
of as a rather vulgar choice of car by
many of his associates, and he became
very irritated when someone with an
identical make moved into the same
street. Fleming’s life also had that
touch of tragic irony which is present
in all of his books like a concealed
acid. Fleming was very physical: he
lived for the smell of glamor, but he
only became famous at the end of
his life, just when his body was be-
ginning to collapse at an unusually
early age.
His physical collapse was-undoubtedly
hastened by too many martinis, too
much nicotine, and the after effects of
too many wild oats sown in his younger
days. His mature years were racked
by heart trouble and the agony of
kidney stones, what he referred to as
“the diamond mines in my kidneys.”
Fleming always tended to live beyond
his means, which were never enor-
mous, because most of the Fleming
family’s wealth had bypassed him.
When he finally did make the big
money he was already dying.
Fleming’s writing has a high-gloss
finish. He writes with dash and verve
and considerable imagination. He is
a master manipulator of facts and
things, but is weak when it comes to
people and characterisation. His
villains are stereotyped. From book
to book their racial type changes, but
the characterisation does not alter.
The women in Fleming’s books tend
to be remote and sexually attractive,
but never very real. His main charac-
ters are either very beautiful or very
ugly. Subsidiary characters necessary
for the plot are often sexually neuter
worker bees who merely do*a job.
It could be argued that characterisa-
tion is not necessary for a spy novel and
the sort of audience which Fleming
wanted. This is true. But a man’s
works are often a pretty good indica-
tion of what goes on inside the man.
And this applies to Fleming.
Fleming in real life paid scant atten-
tion to women’s individuality. From
reading James Bond I had long realised
the basic facts of Fleming’s personality
-—that he was subject to boredom and
accidie, that there was a strong element
of the sensualist in him, and that his
outlook was ultimately one of fan-
tastic despair like that of many people
who are strongly attracted to glamor.
What I had not realised, but this
biography makes it clear, is that until
his marriage at the age of 43 lan
Fleming had a love life similar to
James Bond, a life of cold-blooded
sensual encounters with women. Flem-
ing was in fact writing about himself
when he wrote of Bond in “Casino
Royale” that “with most women his
manner was a mixture of taciturnity
and passion. The lengthy approaches
to a seduction bored him almost as
much as the subsequent mess of dis-
entanglement. He found something
grisly in the inevitability of the pattern
of each affair.” Fleming was con-
tinually restless and fickle with his
lan Fleming
women, and it was only after he had
become quite an experienced lover
that he spent an entire night in bed
with a woman.
Fleming wrote that “a woman should
be an illusion,” and a girlfriend of his
hit the nail on the head when she said
that he had “a remarkable phobia about
bodily things.” Fleming, on one occa-
sion, took a fancy to a girl whom he
saw at a seaside resort, but when she
went behind a rock to relieve herself
he was so disgusted that he wanted
nothing to do with her.
President Kennedy was a James Bond
fan, and “From Russia, With Love”
was placed ninth on the President’s pub-
lished list of favorite books. He met
Fleming before his assumption of the
Presidency, but what struck him par-
ticularly about Fleming was that such
a mature and polished man should have
had such a peculiar imagination. If
Kennedy had known Fleming better,
however, this apparent inconsistency
may have been resolved.
Fleming may have had a very smooth
exterior, but the most surprising thing
that emerges from this biography by
John Pearson is that Fleming was in
many ways strikingly immature. An
extremely highly developed talent,
such as Fleming had, or a particular
type of genius such as Yeats or Blake
had, is often accompanied by extreme
immaturity in certain areas of the per-
sonality. It is as though this talent
feeds on its host, consuming all his
energy so that the rest of him is
stunted.
Fleming’s basic immaturity is borne
out by his relationships with women.
There are other examples of it, however.
All through his life and long before he
seriously set himself to writing, Flem-
ing would indulge in fantasies. At the
age of 19, when he was busily imbibing
Thomas Mann, Rilke, and the great
mainstream of European literature at
the Alpine school where he was study-
ing, Fleming would imagine, while
driving, that he was being followed by
a carload of dangerous criminals, whom
he would wipe out with a gun concealed
in the exhaust pipe of his car.
Fleming’s immaturity also shows in
his obsession with status symbols. When
he was in his forties Fleming cabled
to the representative in New York for
Kemsley newspapers, his employers, re-
questing that he should be picked up
from Idlewild Airport in a Rolls-Royce.
Fleming was particularly annoyed when
only a Lincoln turned up, and cur-
tailed his visit in a huff.
The classic story of Fleming’s im-
maturity took place in World War II
when he occupied a reasonably signi-
ficant position in British Naval In-
telligence at an administrative level.
Fleming and his boss, Admiral God-
frey, were playing in a Portuguese
casino, and Godfrey noticed a “glazed
look” coming over Fleming’s eyes.
Eventually Fleming whispered to God-
frey about the unspectacular Portuguese
with whom they were playing: “Just
suppose those fellows were German
agents —what a coup it would be if
we cleaned them out entirely!” Pear-
son says this thought did not appeal
to Godfrey. This is putting it mildly.
It is interesting that this childish in-
cident was the germ of the magni-
ficent casino sequence in “Casino
Royale.”
In the earlier part of this biography
I feel that Pearson has attempted to
glamorise trivial incidents a bit too
much —all the women fall in love with
Fleming, his mother is beautiful and
impetuous, he is dashing and hand-
some as well as “mixed up.” The
attempt to drag Adler into Fleming’s
adolescent troubles is all a bit too coy.
Fleming himself seems to have been
a bit of a name hunter, and his
biographer follows suit by liberally


spangling the narrative with a surfeit
of names.
The manner in which Fleming
started writing the James Bond series
is particularly interesting. For a num-
ber of years he began to cultivate
literary acquaintances. He was begin-
ning to feel his position in Kemsley
newspapers was a bit uncertain. Then
at the age of 43 he ordered a gold-
plated typewriter, just at the time he
decided also to marry. One day,
secretly and with great hesitation, he
sat down in his rambling Jamaican
house which he had called “Goldeneye,”
and with his brand-new gold-plated
typewriter started effortlessly to type
out the first draft of “Casino Royale.”
The fact that he started writing his
first book and married only a few
weeks later is significant. I feel Fleming
was motivated by his physical decline.
He had for some time been getting
pains in his chest, which were the first
foreboding of the heart disease which
was to cause his death in 1964 at the
comparatively early age of 56. He has
written that he regarded 40 as being
the shadow line, because up to the age
of 40 women will come willingly
to a man, but after that age a man
has to buy them. Fleming was far
too proud to want to buy women. Tak-
ing into account this attitude, it is only
natural that Fleming should have
wished to settle down. And if one is
giving away the life of casual sexual
encounters, what more natural way of
sublimating is there than to write about
them?
Fleming had that rare romanticism
so strongly engrained that it survives
into middle age. He had the rare art
of being able to turn his private
neuroses into popular obsessions, but
just as he did so death arrived like a
gold-coated pill at the moment of
fruition.
Macmillan’s Tragic Era
By CORAL BELL
Winds of Change: 1914-1939. Harold
Macmillan. Macmillans. $7.70.
HISTORY plays favorites among
the generations of men, allocat-
ing to some easy times and to
others a catalogue of change and dis-
aster. Toward the generations born
in the middle and late ’nineties she
might be held to have demonstrated
a positive spite, arranging that they
should pass from austerely repressive
schoolrooms straight to the trenches of
World War I, and that those who sur-
vived thart bloodbath should spend their
young manhood in the pangs of re-
adjustment, their thirties in the waste-
lands of depression and appeasement,
and their middle years still more
bleakly in the reinforced discomforts,
boredom, and alarms of World War
11. Even now providence has not
relaxed its disfavor: they have lived
to see their grandchildren enter a
strange new landscape whose affluence
and permissive mores may seem almost
as alarming as the nuclear shadows
that fall across it sometimes.
Harold Macmillan makes an appro-
priate chronicler for this generation in
political England. He was, one might
at first assume, a typically lucky mem-
ber of this unlucky generation, born
to a flourishing family business and to
Eton and Oxford, marrying the
daughter of a duke and surviving to
a lively Prime Ministership.
Yet one of the qualities that makes
this first volume of his memoirs sympa-
thetic and often rather touching is the
clear evidence of how vulnerable he
was to the assorted kinds of anguish
that came the way of his less well-
placed contemporaries. This particular
volume is not chiefly an exploration
of the corridors of power, though the
later ones doubtless will be. It takes
one through his childhood and youth,
through the battle of the Somme and
the douceur de vivre of the ’twenties
as a young man attached by marriage
to a great ducal house, then through
14 years as a Conservative backbencher
for a distressed northern industrial con-
stituency, to the outbreak of war.
Though he obviously always lived
among the powerful, he held no office
of power himself until the Churchill
Government of 1940.
Mr. Macmillan is certainly as com-
plicated a man as has ever become
Prime Minister, not excluding the pre-
Harold Macmillan
sent incumbent. Even his friends called
him devious, and his enemies used a
stronger word. One of the main in-
terests of political biography of this
sort is to trace the origins of those
techniques and impulses which later
emerge in political action. Mr. Mac-
millan’s characteristic mode of opera-
tion as Prime Minister, someone per-
ceptively observed, was that of the
rower who makes his way steadily in
one direction while gazing fixedly in
the opposite one.
Thus, though Mr. Macmillan might
wax eloquent at Conservative Party
rallies over the glories of the imperial
past, he wound up the remnants of the
imperial estate much faster than the
Labor Governments had dared to do,
giving the process such impetus that
it could not be slowed when he left
office. It seems astounding to recall
A baby sleeping
Your eyes alter. Their focus is
enlarging, iris-wide, then wide like the sky,
holding in a circle distances.
The clouds of sleep obscure; still I sit,
guessing at shadow-substances that slip
through the strange precinct under your lidded eyes.
Animals, children, toys are unknown to you.
I search for symbols of what you do perceive,
knowing you dream, and dreams are images.
I try to attract far sleeps, but memory
refuses to magnetise, yet all I dream
is drawn from infancy’s infinitude:
hallways, closing doors, rooms, presences,
protective, menacing, half-known, half-lit.
You, too, may see these premises of peace and wars.

that when he became Prime Minister
in 1957 there were only ten sovereign
Commonwealth members, as against
the present 22, even allowing for the
loss by the wayside of South Africa
and Rhodesia. Further, he was pre-
pared to complement this tidying away
of a logically completed phase of
Britain’s history by moving briskly to-
ward his concept of the new phase,
with the bid to enter Europe. Thus he
dexterously stole for the Conservative
Party the normal Labor appeal of the
Party of Change, leaving Hugh Gait-
skell to propose, as an alternative,
faithfulness to “a thousand years of
history.” This neat piece of role-
reversal perhaps disconcerted his own
party as much as the other side, and
whether the present equally astute
operator, Harold Wilson, can undo its
effects is still an open question. He is
said to be an admirer and a student
of the earlier Harold.
One cannot but connect this charac-
teristic Macmillan mode of radicalism
by indirection with the circumstances of
his early life.
His mother was loving but formidable,
and obviously demanding, his father
affectionate but remote. The picture
of life in an upper-middle-class nursery
of those days has a certain pathos still.
The conditioning which produced a
settled conviction that “something un-
pleasant was more likely to happen
than anything pleasant,” that people of
all ages would be more likely to be
troublesome than agreeable, was still
with the mature politician making a
speech as Prime Minister. Perhaps the
toughness of Edwardian childhoods pro-
vided a useful survival-training for the
patch of history that generation had to
live through.
This is not a book of insider’s reve-
lations: those familiar with the politi-
cal history of this century will find
little that is new or surprising. But
it is very agreeable and engaging read-
ing, illuminating the period concerned
with a sort of reticent imaginativeness
and a wry throw-away humor. For
those genuinely interested in what
makes political parties survive and suc-
ceed, it offers uncommonly good
source-material on the essential tough-
ness, resilience, and adaptability that
has made the Conservative Party so
formidable a competitor for power by
election.
The Jewish Spirit
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
The Family Moskat. Isaac Singer.
Seeker and Warburg. $5.30.
BY following the fortunes of one
leading Polish Jewish House, the
family of Meshulam Moskat,
from its prosperous prime in the early
part of the 20th century, when it
spreads and flourishes over Warsaw as
seemingly indestructible as an Old
Testament bay tree, to its decline and
fall, Isaac Singer’s book manages to
trace the tragic fate of Eastern Jewry
in our age.
Calmly, without bitterness, the
author shows what it was like to be
a Jew in a largely anti-Semitic city,
conveniently “blamed for everything
... if the lamp flickered, if the water-
closet was occupied”: the world’s
readymade scapegoat for all its own
frustrations. Singer casts wide horizons.
He writes almost exclusively of Jewry,
but never as an inmate of anything
resembling an intellectual ghetto. He
never sees the Semites as a race apart
neither privileged as the chosen
people nor especially underprivileged,
but simply as an integral part of the
human race (“What difference was
there between one religion and another?
Did not Jews and Christians pray to the
same God?”)
Asa Heshel is the minority among
minorities, the intellectual who marries
a Moskat stepdaughter (Adele) and
later a granddaughter (Hadassah), and
first seems destined to fulfil a role
similar to the great Semitic creative
figures a Schoenberg, a Chagall, but
he does not keep his early promise:
dreamy, neurotic, undisciplined, he
moons through the novel without the
tenacity to complete anything he starts.
With his what’s-the-use philosophy,
“the human race is no more important
than flies or bedbugs,” he has at the
end accomplished nothing.
However, through Asa, the author
seems to be showing how the potential
creative spirit of our century has too
often been diverted to the struggle for
mere survival: the Anne Franks died
before their time, the thinkers have
had to put their fingers in the dyke or
their spades to the desert.
The most positive member of the
family is the universal uncle figure,
Abram Moskat, a huge, flamboyant,
gluttonous, wining and wenching Fal-
staffian personality who overflows the
book as irresistibly as a tidal wave.
There is the converted Masha who
marries a Christian and becomes a
pillar of Polish society, elegantly
adorning the glossies, worse than dead
to her family, not wholly accepted by
the others; and the inversion of this
theme, the Gentile Communist Bar-
bara, whose bed Asa shares but not her
ideology. There is the Zionist who suc-
ceeds in getting to Palestine and the
migrant whom the immigration quota
turns back again to Hitler’s advancing
gas-chambers. Others, like Hadassah,
are killed by the first German bombs,
more will die of starvation.
Scattered throughout are many color-
ful descriptions of ancient Hebrew cus-
toms and their origins.
Toward the end, a Moskat son begins
the ritual intonation, “This is the bread
of affliction which our forefathers ate
in the land of Egypt . , and perhaps
the 600 pages of this teeming chronicle
can best be seen as a long contemporary
footnote which adds: and are still eating
to this day.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Issues for 1967
WHEN you look at prospects overseas, as foreseen by
the “Economist” (see pages 35 and 39), 1967 in
Australia does not loom so badly after all. What-
ever the past failings of policy, the burdens of the drought,
and the defence build-up, the Australian economy enters
the new year from a better position that most other
economies. Our level of unemployment is marginally on the
high side, and industry is operating slightly below capacity,
but there isn’t anything like the slack which has appeared
in the economies of Britain, Germany, and Italy, with even
France worrying a bit about its balance of payments. Our
external position, with a huge wheat crop maturing and
mineral exports booming, is extraordinarily good, even
though prices may weaken from now on. We don’t suffer
the political uncertainties of Germany, Japan, or the U.S.
even, and we don’t have the chronic structural deficiencies
and general malaise of Britain. Only the quiet, well-adjusted
Swedes can look ahead as calmly as we. That at least allows
us to fulfil a New Year’s resolution to look on the bright
side of things.
It is not that there are no uncertainties about the immedi-
ate future. We have spoken about them often: the flatness
of industrial production, the dullness of consumer spending,
and the possibility that these may lead to a sharp fall in
business investment spending. Suffice it to say for the time
being that the closing months of last year brought a little
extra seasonal cheer, making 1967 prospects look just a
little brighter than before. Retail sales looked to have a
firmer trend, and the Bank of N.S.W.-ACMA survey of
business intentions was reassuring, too. The car industry
seemed to have extraordinary good sales during the month
of November. None of this is to suggest that the troubles
we spoke of are over. Many more indicators of similar
economic brightness would need to turn up before any such
optimistic reassessment could be justified.
We still believe that the Government should act immedi-
ately to give the economy a small boost. It can do this
through giving the State Premiers generous treatment when
they arrive in Canberra in February. And it must still con-
sider whether tax cuts are justified to restore the strength
of consumer spending. But our argument is also that the
Government can well afford this year to spend some time
and energy on the economic issues which are less pressing,
yet of great importance to the future. It can raise its sights
to higher time horizons. Examples?
It is high time for some quiet thought about where our
tariff policies are leading. Last year saw aggressively pro-
tective tariffs imposed on two of our most important indus-
tries. In the case of motor vehicles, the scheme simply proved
unworkable, and its implementation has been postponed. It
should be radically revised in line with the Tariff Board’s
recommendations or the industry will end up with only
three firms controlling virtually the whole Australian market.
In the case of chemicals, the notable fact is that we have
had old import controls quietly but effectively reintroduced
through the back door. The floating tariff can be used to
keep out all competitive imports. All these developments
are quite contrary to the letter of many of our trade treaty
obligations and to the spirit of the Kennedy Round and
other efforts at increasing international trade. More per-
tinently, by directing the resources of a fully employed
economy yet more deeply into unproductive and unpaying
areas of activity, these policies insidiously cut away at the
growth potential of the economy.
This threatens secondary injuries. Through reducing the
MEN AND MATTERS
'JJNWORRIED by the “Wall Street
Journal’s” prediction that history
would forget him, Lang Hancock, the
58-year-old Western Australian who 30
years ago discovered asbestos in the
Pilbara and in 1952 the fabulous Ham-
ersley iron ore deposits, staked another
claim to be remembered last week.
He and his partner Ernest Wright
bought the threatened ghost town, Wit-
tenoom, and its blue asbestos mine, lock
stock and barrel, apart from civic pro-
perty, for an unstated sum (book value
was $7 million) and projected massive
new industrial schemes for the region.
The reprieve for Wittenoom (whose
asbestos mine he ran from 1938 until
he sold to CSR in 1943) is only a minor
part of Hancock’s prospectus. Apart
from the big manganese ore deals he
made six months ago, he has his sights
on the development of a new port at
Cape Lambert whose suitability im-
pressed a recent Dutch survey party,
an eventual fourfold expansion of Wit-
tenoom’s output (the mine closed a
fortnight ago), an asbestos-cement fac-
tory, an oil refinery (presumably using
Barrow Island crude), and a new rail
outlet to the coast from the Fortescue
Valley.
Hinting the partners had big over-
seas money in the background to en-
sure a successful follow-through to the
commit me n t of
their own millions
no Av mounting
daily from iron
ore royalties and
vast pastoral in-
terests, Mr. Han-
cock denied his
plans were dic-
tated by senti-
ment. But this
could have played
a part. His life
has been bound
up with the Pil-
bara, where his grandfather went in
the 1850 s and established the family’s
two properties.
Lang Hancock has always main-
tained that the ailing mine could be
kept going by increasing throughput
probably three times, and getting away
from conference line to direct charter
shipping which he says would cut
freight about 90 percent.
'JHE real test for Wittenoom will be
whether or not Hancock and
Wright can bring in the kind of
money needed to get the town on its
feet in a big way. Characteristically,
Lang Hancock deserted the Christmas-
New Year party circuit in Perth to fly
north to see whether or not the town
could be kept ticking over long enough

to secure outside finance. He was satis-
fied it could. Now he is looking for a
group with Australian dividends to
divert to Wittenoom, some $lO million
or so, and a framework strong enough
to set up manufacture of asbestos,
breaking Hardie’s virtual Australian
monopoly.
Paradoxically, his biggest obstacles
are likely to be thrown up by the
State Government. Lang Hancock, in
doing exactly the kind of thing the
State prides itself on doing, has put
himself offside with “rival” big thinkers.
It took the “Wall Street Journal” to
point out the way the State was trying
to play down the role he had in finding
the iron ore and bringing in the kind
of capital needed to develop it.


rate of growth of the Australian market it must reduce the
attractiveness of Australia as a place to invest and therefore
adversely affect capital inflow. Also, by lowering the potential
for raising living standards, it will hit at our ability to attract
migrants. If this Government is to continue to seriously claim
an interest in economic growth, it must soon take a new
look at its tariff policies.
There are other obvious issues. The trade practices legisla-
tion already enacted must be put into operation. By any
international standards what is now on the statute book
must be regarded as only a tentative first step. For instance,
if there is to be real price competition in important areas
of the economy, price fixing by manufacturers (resale price
maintenance so-called) must be outlawed. Federal-State
financial relations are getting into an increasingly unholy
mess, though given the antagonistic interests bogged down
in it, it is difficult to see a way out. Mr. McMahon should
be devoting himself to devising something.
But closing on the problems of economic management,
what looks to be the most urgently needed is a start on
improving the quality of information about the changing
state of the economy. For all the lies that can be told
about them, we need statistics, and much better ones than
are currently available. They would allow Cabinet Ministers
to feel far more confident about the basis of their economic
policies. And businessmen, too.
The Western Approaches
THE Christmas visit of W.A.’s iron ore fields by three of
the top brass of the world’s biggest steelmakers, United
States Steel Corporation, prompted speculation in the
“Wall Street Journal” that this high-grade ore was of such
quality that even the eastern States’ steel mills of America
were interested in buying it. But in W.A.’s iron business
there is another theory: that the U.S. Steel people flew
out because this new iron ore bonanza could change the
structure of American steel competition.
The theory is that the low price and high grade of
Western Australian ore could rebound on U.S. Steel in
three ways: because the company is a supplier, not a buyer,
of ore, any eroding of world prices would have some
effect; because the ore is being sold predominantly to Japan,
the competitiveness of Japanese steel is being increased, and
because there are prospects of this ore being imported into
the United States, it could place U.S. Steel at a relative dis-
advantage alongside smaller competitors, whose plants are
near the coast, particularly the west coast.
Already, smaller producers like the Alan Wood Steel Co.,
of Pennsylvania, have said they are interested in the ore,
but have been put off by freight costs. But the official
emergence in the West of the Daniel K. Ludwig organisation
— proprietors of National Bulk Carriers Inc., who specialise
in mammoth oil and ore carriers — will change this picture
considerably. Relocation of American steel plants has been
resisted for many years, but the theory holds that such
changes in pattern as those provided from Western Aus-
tralia might force a reassessment of this position. And to
look at this likely impact from Australia — this was the
motive for the Americans’ visit.
Few went along with the official story that chairman
Roger M. Blough, president L. B. Worthington, and vice-
president foreign operations E. G. Jacobsen were in the
West, away from their families between Christmas and New
Year, just for a holiday. And the most popular theory has
been that they were there as guests of Mt. Newman mana-
gers, BHP, with the thought of taking up some of the 40
percent equity Amax seem keen to unload.
The same Texan approach has followed pages of classified
ads proclaiming Hamersley Iron’s application for 58 lime-
stone leases near Dampier. This application covers millions
of tons of limestone on the mainland and on ten of the
Dampier Archipelago islands. Although limestone is used in
pelletising, and Hamersley has started building the first of
its pellet plants at Dampier, the Western Australian reaction
was that this underlined Hamersley’s determination to be-
come a steel producer. For one ton of limestone is needed
for every three of iron ore in the steel-making process.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
FOr the economy: Some interstate wrangling
(proceeding from South Australia and Queensland) is
disturbing the smoothness of the agreement between the
Commonwealth-Victoria and Esso-BHP covering oil and
gas from the Bass Strait fields. Royalty and relinquish-
ment terms and a few technical matters still call for
resolution, especially in the light of future uniform
legislation. Meanwhile guesses about very substantial
oil prospects from the Marlin wells await a firmer and
expected statement from Esso-BHP.
Retailers have begun to sound more joyful following
record December sales, but the latest trends need more
confirmation . . . Both General Motors-Holden and
Ford Australia report much better vehicle sales for
December . . . November’s savings bank deposits rose
at about the same rate as in October and September.
The ANZ Bank joins the call “for a moderate stimu-
lus to improve confidence and lift consumer spending.”
For the markets: The first few days of the new
year opened brightly on Australian share markets as
ranges broadened and turnovers were stimulated. That
happier pattern did not completely survive the week,
since quite a body of leading industrials gave a little
ground on profit-taking, which extended also to some
second-liners previously well sought. Base metals ran a
succession of peaks, yet showed some sectional uneven-
ness.
A mild optimism continues to inspire London, which
holds firm on a possible Bank Rate cut and some refla-
tionary measures . . . Wall Street started a typical
January advance, yet there’s not much new to sustain it.
For companies: At least the year opened tradi-
tionally with Melbourne flourmiller Robert Hutchinson
leading in the interim reports; six months to Decem-
ber 31 showed net earnings at $124,003 (previously
$109,568), a steady dividend, and a comment of lower
profit margins on much higher sales. Furniture maker
Sebels’ start to 1967 appears “most likely” good to
directors, after better sales in 1966 and profit to com-
pare favorably with 1965’s record.
The miners were certainly unaffected by start-of-year
lethargy . . . CSR’s blue asbestos mine at Wittenoom
(W.A.) and other assets at Point 'Samson and
Cossack have been bought by their first developers,
Messsrs. Lang Hancock and E. A. Wright . . .
Moura coalmines, owned by Thiess-Peabody-Mitsui, are
to sell an extra 15 million tons to Japanese steel mills;
the new deal is worth $133 million . . . Western Mining
Corporation pays a steady 5 cents a share dividend,
tax free . . . Rutile producer Associated Minerals in-
creased output by more than 50 percent over 24 weeks
to December 15; zircon production rose 15 percent . . .
Broken Hill South’s December half-year yielded more
lead and silver, and less zinc, from Broken Hill; more
copper is coming from Cobar, yet the rate remains be-
low forecast levels . . . Renison has signed a contract to
supply tin concentrates for a Spanish smelter in 1967
Australia’s first significant export of tin.
The City Mutual Life Assurance Society started
slowly in 1966, but ended up by achieving record new
business; new premium income, however, eased very
slightly . . . Both new life business and new premium
income dropped back for Legal and General Assur-
ance; fire, accident, and marine premiums were better
. . . Money market dealer Delfin Discount sent profit
up from $19,024 to $162,346 in 1966, to give a 23.7
percent earning rate on capital owned entirely by De-
velopment Finance Corporation; dealings in commercial
bills have expanded.
Real estate developer Savoy Corporation has had its
1965 accounts heavily qualified by auditors; two years
to June 30 last produced group losses totalling
$2,490,869.

Organisation Men at BHP
By CROESUS
THE many Australian companies
who’ve gone gaily into diversified
lines of activity, often remote
from their central one, or have simply
had diversification thrust upon them by
circumstances of technological change,
discovery, or simply logical expansion,
should take a good look at the changes
soon to be effected in the managerial
structure of BHP, which propel this
monolith some distance, if not yet all
the way, toward the ultimate in decen-
tralisation.
It’s always been a bit of a mystery
as to who does exactly what among
the happy family in the ivory towers
of BHP. Sir Colin Syme, the chair-
man these last fourteen years, has been
dubbed the piper, perhaps because he’s
had to do most of the talking at annual
meetings lately that is, when he
could get a word in over Mr. Shep-
herd. Sir lan McLennan has had his
say on occasions, as well as appearing to
do more work than anybody else. The
big mystery man was the retiring man-
aging director, Mr. Norman Jones. The
veil hasn’t been lifted on him by the
reorganisation, and he slips out of the
BHP scene as silent as we’ve always
known him, a great servant to the com-
pany and Australia.
It is a pity these changes have been
headed by one which seems to me to
be out of context and even retrograde:
the new role cast for the chairman, Sir
Colin Syme, who now becomes a full-
time executive director. The only valid
reason for this move would seem to be
that, as Sir Colin has been spending
about two-thirds of his time on BHP
affairs, it seems only fair that he should
be more adequately recompensed for
his work. Surely this could have been
arranged without loading him with
special executive functions, leaving him
absolutely free to perform the true
functions of a chairman. And, even
if this might be unthinkable in his
case, divest the chairman of some of
the roles he has been performing and
clearing his desk for the task. If it were
to be put to the vote of shareholders
I’m sure an independent chairman
would be preferred.
Do I hear an echo of the com-
plaint that the BHP board, and its
chairman not least, seem not all that
concerned about shareholders’ interests?
I think I ,d°- There always looked to
be the chance while Sir Colin surveyed
the BHP scene from the professional
directors’ suites at Hedderwick, Fookes,
and Alston that the penny would drop.
That chance has gone with the new
wind blowing at 400 Bourke Street.
In suggesting that BHP’s chairman
should be an outside independent
director, I am not saying or even hint-
ing that Sir Colin is not the right man
for the new executive jobs he will now
take on. These involve policy and
planning for the organisation and the
development of the group, with the
emphasis on the cultivation of human
resources. He’s been doing that sort of
thing at BHP for a long time. He will
also chair one of the two committees,
the finance one, to be set up, with Sir
lan McLennan chairing the other, the
executive one.
I T so happens that with the retire-
ment of Mr. Norman Jones, who has
been managing director since 1952
(when Sir Colin first became chair-
man), one executive director replaces
another on the board, leaving outside
directors in a majority of five to two,
with two positions vacant in the nine-
man team allowed for in the articles.
The other executive director is Sir lan
McLennan, who goes up from general
manager to managing director, replac-
ing Mr. Jones.
These two top executives each gets
an assistant and, as with the other
promotions, one immediately gets an
impression of the high quality of what
one might regard as the second layer
of BHP executives. The chairman’s
assistant will be highly qualified
accountant J. F. Rich, now 47, who
combines general manager administra-
tion with that role. He emerged from
Newcastle High School to become assis-
tant secretary of BHP twenty years ago
and graduated to his present position
as one of the heirs apparent through
various manager jobs and directorships
of subsidiaries. McLennan’s new assis-
tant, J. C. Richards, 55, was a Queens-
land Rhodes Scholar, has had a dis-
tinguished record in steel and ship-
building with the group, and, since
1959, has been general manager
development and shipbuilding.
The dichotomy of administration
and operations has, of course, always
been recognised. The new structure de-
fines it more clearly. It is rather on
the operations side that the reorganisa-
tion was sorely needed. As chief general
manager under the superseded struc-
ture, McLennan virtually had to issue
orders to all the innumerable opera-
tional managers in the organisation who
had direct access to him. The job of
chief general manager now lapses and
in effect there are created eight heads
of particular activities, who now will
report direct to McLennan as managing
director.
!'J*HESE eight men go under various
titles. Going on their designations of
“executive general managers,” the two
presumably to be regarded as more
important than the others are J. C.
Norgard, operations, and J. C. McNeill,
finance. Like Richards, Norgard is a
highly degreed engineer who joined
BHP from Adelaide University about
the same time as McLennan did from
Melbourne about thirty years ago. One
of the few present BHP executives to
join the services during the last war
(he was in the RAAF), Norgard was
earlier the author of several publica-
tions in his field.
In taking over the detailed super-
vision of the group’s steel operations,
Norgard would seem to be key man
on the operations side, because this is
far and away the biggest of BHP’s
activities. Further, one understands
BHP will eventually bring its ship-
building and engineering operations
under Mr. Norgard’s wing. For the time
being it will operate outside this major
“profit-earning centre,” under Mr.
W. W. Sweetland as its general man-
ager, who will have a direct line to
the managing director.
Another major profit-earning centre
will be constituted by a grouping of
BHP subsidiaries, including Commsteel,
Australian Wire Industries, the ship-
yard, and Titan. No general manager
has yet been appointed for this group,
whose activities will be more highly
integrated than at present. The profit-
earning centre idea, across BHP’s old
subsidiaries’ structure, is now widely
employed in the United States and
would seem to be the answer several of
the biggest industrial companies with
widely diversified interests have been
looking for here. Ultimately BHP en-

Respite for Sterling Test for Dollars
The year 7 966 has seen an end for a moment at least to sterling's long travail. The challenge in 1967
looks different, if no less familiar. A substantial German surplus will emerge. So should a British surplus, but
perhaps at the cost of a widening American deficit,
THE year 1967 ought in theory to
be a relatively tranquil one.
The upheavals on the exchange
markets which accompanied the long
sterling crisis are (for the moment?)
over. But it does not look a vintage
year. What all the evidence points to
for the world economy as a whole is
slower growth, continuing imbalance
in international payments, a continua-
tion of a pattern of international in-
terest rates still distinctly high in terms
of demand pressures, and an intensi-
fication of direct restrictions of move-
ments of funds across frontiers. Just
now these are only possibilities. It is
right to call attention to the dangers
—if only once more to remind the
more reluctant members of the world’s
central bankers that the need for con-
tingency planning on a world liquidity
reform has not disappeared with the
(temporary?) disappearance of the
sterling problem in its acute form. But
it would be a mistake to over drama-
tise them. It could turn out differently.
The one economy to watch, where a
change in policy could greatly improve
this picture, is Germany.
But the course of the new govern-
ment in Bonn is only one of the many
uncertainties overhanging 1967. An-
other, for Britain, is the Common Mar-
ket. The psychological fillip of success-
ful negotiations for British entry could
go far to outweigh the economic strains
of adjustment —even in the short run.
A flat “non” from the General, on the
other hand, could give sterling some
bad moments although the central
banks are in a far better position now
than in 1963 to offset any shock selling
of sterling. And the shock itself is not
likely to be so great —certainly before
formal negotiations are even on. What
hopeful optimism there has been about
a successful British bid this time round
has been much more qualified—recent
noises .from Paris have hardly en-
couraged false hopes. Failure may
already have been largely discounted.
But the two biggest questionmarks
are Vietnam and Rhodesia. These
could upset all the calculations. Capitu-
lation by Mr. Smith or a success for
U Thant’s efforts could only be wel-
comed —even if. a sudden outbreak of
peace in Vietnam might mean a dif-
ficult transitional period for an already
weakening American economy. Un-
happily, neither eventuality looks prob-
able at the present moment. Instead,
the danger is that the war in Viet-
nam will become still hotter and that
the struggle with Rhodesia could just
conceivably lead to a confrontation
with South Africa.
Escalation in Africa could cost
Britain the bulk of the gains it can
otherwise expect in its overseas accounts
this coming year directly by slashing
into this country’s earnings in the im-
portant South African market, and in-
directly by putting upward pressure on
commodity prices. Arid it could touch
off a dangerous outflow of short-term
capital. Escalation in Vietnam would
increase the strains on the dollar
which already looks likely to have a
roughter passage in 1967. Together,
blow-ups in Africa and Vietnam could
put almost intolerable strain on the
entire world monetary system. Even
with the enormously strengthened net-
work of swop defences among the lead-
The
Economist
Forecast
for 1967
ing central banks, the system could
hardly bet on emerging unchanged
or unscathed - from the upheavals of
a simultaneous shift further toward a
wartime economy in America and a
direct clash with the free world’s
largest gold producer. The most
realistic “best” hope is little change on
either front: the confining of sanctions
to Rhodesia alone and no major
stepping-up of hostilities in Vietnam.
IF that holds, what then for the world
economy in 1967? First, three bull
points. One is the continuing strong
recovery of production in Japan, Italy,
and France, economies which together
account for more than 17 percent of
the total output of the industrial
Western countries and roughly 15 per-
cent of all world imports. The other
two bull points, which are related, are
the expected swing of Britain’s overseas
payments from deficit into substantial
surplus and the unusual strength of the
exchange reserves held by primary pro-
ducers.
There is every prospect that the
import demand of the primary pro-
ducers will be more buoyant, despite
the slide in commodity prices from their
June peak in the second half of 1966
and the possibility of a further, although
minor, dip in the months ahead. This
looks particularly true of the more
developed countries of the overseas
sterling area —apart from the relatively
lightweight New Zealand, which intro-
duced stricter import controls in July.
But the less developed countries—with
the large and challenging exception of
India—are also better placed. Admit-
tedly, their current export earnings in
1967 are not expected to match the
high levels of 1966. Moreover, there is
little likelihood, given the current drive
for foreign exchange economies in both
Britain and the United States, that their
receipts of aid and private long-term
capital will do more than hold up—at
best. But these are qualifications to a
basically quite favorable position
Primary producers as a whole now
enjoy a higher level of reserves than at
any other time in the past decade. And
even though these countries have
become increasingly cagy about run-
ning down these resources, the Organisa-
tion for Economic Development and
Co-operation reckons that their total
imports from the industrial countries
could rise as much as 9 percent in 1967
against some 6J percent in 1966.
This bonus is all the more important
because for the first time it looks as if
the proliferation of direct restrictions on
trade and capital movements, and the
partly consequential tightening of inter-
national money and capital markets,
will exact a toll from growth in several
of the highly developed countries of the
OECD. This s not just a matter of
Mr. Wilson’s drastic deliberate de-
flation. Mercifully, Britain’s colorful
Dunkirks to save the pound now have
a relatively diminished impact on the
rest of the world; Britain buys less than
10 percent of the world’s imports today
compared with some 20 percent in
1931. The real crunch is that tight
money has begun to bite into civilian
demand in America and has been the
single most powerful factor in bringing
the German miracle to the edge of
recession.
FEW weeks ago the OECD’s
experts in Paris were still able to
predict that total growth in member
countries might be running at 4 percent
plus in 1967 compared with 5 percent
in 1966. Later figuring, however, sug-
gests that this pitched both years’
figures too high. Not that there has been
any change in the optimistic outlook
for France, Italy, and Japan. In all
three, upswings originally triggered by
exports and stockbuilding are now
being underpinned increasingly by
domestic demand, most critically by a
revival of private investment outlays.
Moreover, in all three there are few
signs of serious strain. There is still too
large a margin of spare capacity and
manpower for that although there
should be a (welcome) fall in their
combined external surpluses. Indeed,
France’s current surplus with non-franc
countries may disappear entirely during
the course of the coming year, despite
considerable margins of unemployment
and no more than a “normal” growth
rate. Capital inflows and the earnings
of the overseas franc area should en-
sure that France does not slip into
actual balance of payment losses.
But any surplus it earns will be
a considerably diminished one
a turn of events that could just

conceivably soften the General’s stand
on the need for international liquidity
props.
The changes have been on the out-
look for the other heavyweights. The
best guess now is that deceleration in
America, Germany, and Britain—and,
less importantly, in Holland—will out-
weigh gains in France, Italy, and Japan.
Growth in both the United States and
Europe could be closer to 3J percent,
well below the potential capacity
growth of just over 4 percent. In
itself, this might be viewed by the more
conservative as no bad thing. The snag
is that there is little prospect that this
slowdown with the exception of
Britain’s exercise—will contribute to a
better balance in the world’s economy
as a whole, certainly in the short-run.
Indeed, the danger for 1967 is that the
United States will bear the major brunt
of a swing into substantial surplus not
only by the British balance of payments
but also, once more, by the German.
A swing into surplus by Britain could
only be heartily welcomed —not least
by Washington. And, after the long
attrition on this country’s resources in
1964-66 and the large snowballing of
debts, the bigger the surplus the better.
Happily, on any reckoning, the swing
is likely to be large. The prospects
are for a swing in Britain’s basic
external accounts that would at
least reverse this year’s estimated £2OO
million deficit and could even run as
high as a £250-£3OO million surplus.
The immediate problem is the juxta-
position of a continuing large deficit in
the American balance of payments with
the re-emergence of a German surplus.
There are two prongs to the German
payments outlook and both are wor-
rying. One is the very real prospect
that the distinct weakening of Ger-
many’s domestic economy could pro-
duce a swing in the country’s current
account from a small deficit in 1966
to a surplus of anything up to
billion in 1967. The other is the pos-
sibility that this current surplus will not
be offset by any substantial outflow of
capital and could, indeed, even be
reinforced by an inflow of funds from
abroad if the government is now bent
on abolishing Dr. Erhard’s withholding
tax on foreign-held German bonds to
boost the ailing capital market.
This possibility is worrying enough
in itself. It is more so seen against the
prospects for the American payments
position. America’s current account is
already weakened under the impact of
Vietnam and intensifying pressures on
costs and prices at home in 1966. It
is unlikely to do better in 1967. The
official guesstimates that put the rise
in America’s exports next year at 13
percent implying an actual rise in
that country’s share of world export
markets and imports slowing down
to a growth of only 4-5 percent fourth
quarter to fourth quarter looked
wildly optimistic while the prospects
were still for 4 percent growth in gross
national product. They still look high
on the more recent, unofficial guesses
of growth at 3% percent especially
when it is remembered that the lower
figure involves accepting at face value
Mr. McNamara’s forecast of a sharp
drop in defence spending in six months’
time.
True, the Administration has ex-
tended its voluntary restraints on capi-
tal flows and stressed that it does
mean business. But how much more
can be expected of these? In 1966
American companies were able both
The
Economist
Forecast
for 1967
to pursue their planned expansions
abroad and to adhere to the letter ol
the President’s restraints by stepping up
their borrowing abroad. American com-
panies and banks drew very heavily on
the international market for Euro-
dollars and from national markets in
Europe. Again confounding the pessi-
mists, the international supply of funds
remained extremely elastic. But that
adaptability, in the face of increased
pressures, depended very heavily on
some highly unorthodox and prob-
ably temporary capital flows, above
all on injections of funds from Italy
and Japan.
As the OECD pointed out in its
November issue of the “Economic Out-
look,” the combined swing of the capi-
tal accounts of these two countries in
the two years to June, 1966, was suf-
ficient not only to offset the decline in
funds from the traditional suppliers of
international funds and to meet the new
American demands on European mar-
kets, but also to meet the development
of a substantial demand for foreign
funds in Germany, which persisted
throughout much of 1966. A repeat
performance can hardly be counted on
in 1967. Reflation and in Italy’s case
floods is pushing up domestic de-
mands for funds in both Italy and
Japan. What is clear is that demand
for funds will remain high $l2OO
million is already in the pipeline for
the Euro-bond market alone next year.
'JpHIS means that President Johnson’s
voluntary controls will meet their
toughest test yet. Good behaviour by
the American banks —now well below
their ceiling on foreign loans—can be
guaranteed on present trends only by
a continuation of high interest rates.
Good behaviour by companies rests
uncomfortably heavily on their good
will. It might not stretch far enough.
The Administration could yet be forced
to move to formal controls on capital.
It would be a step taken reluctantly.
Washington can argue with some jus-
tice that the whole of last year’s defi-
cit, now estimated at something over
1965’s $1.3 billion on a liquidity basis,
reflected the (exceptional) cost of
Vietnam —the direct foreign-exchange
cost alone is running at $9OO million
a year.
But there are those saving question
marks. Peace in Vietnam would be the
great blessing. The lesser one, but very
welcome and easier, would be a change
in policy in Germany. Full-blooded
reflation in Germany accompanied
by a monetary policy deliberately
geared to facilitating capital outflows —
could pave the way to lower interest
rates in America and Britain and make
a major contribution to a healthy
balance in the world economy. That
key remains in Frankfurt. It could be
turned.

World Bourses in 1967

MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANAL Y S I S • COMMOD I T I E S
IF markets depended solely on the
economic outlook in the countries
concerned, then 1967 would not be
a very cheerful year on any of the
bourses discussed below. But any
examination of the outlook must also
take into account what economic out-
look is implied in the present level of
markets; it must also consider when the
market concerned had its peak, and
what has happened to the economy
concerned since then.
Looked at this way, the group of
four Continental markets (France, Ger-
many, Holland, Italy) now standing
at around 40 percent below their all-
time highs must be of potential in-
vestor interest whatever happens to
the economies concerned in 1967. They
all peaked out in a wild fit of over-
optimism over prospects for the golden
’sixties some four or five years ago;
since then the markets have languished,
while the economies of the countries
concerned have not. So that instead
of anticipating profits attainable only
in the distant future, as they did in
1961-62, economic reality has how
caught up, or even passed, the dreams
expressed in the market levels of five
years ago. In most cases, these mar-
kets seem to us to be allowing for
the worst that can happen to the
economies involved in 1967, but take
no account of any improvement to
be expected in the following years.
This factor is clearly of most im-
portance in those markets which have
furthest to go before regaining their all-
time highs. Any improvement is then
merely a retracing of old steps, after
a great deal of economic advance in
the intervening years, not a strenuous
seeking of new high levels, always a
neurotic business, as Wall Street showed
in the later stages of the 1963-66 bull
market. And the strength of this lack-
of-anticipation factor is reinforced by
the dreariness of so many markets in
1966 in countries which were economic-
ally prosperous.
Australia
Australia is at the delicate point of
reflation. The budget in August was
mildly expansionary. But consumption
has not yet shown signs of rising seri-
ously, and private investment is slug-
gish. With the election over, further
reflation with good scope for some
growth in company profits can be ex-
pected. Share prices, however, have so
far shown little enthusiasm. But, as in
London, bonds have turned the corner.
With the right dose of reflation, in-
vestors’ minds could quickly be occu-
pied with the continuing boom in Aus-
tralia’s mineral resources and foreign
investment in them. This could lead to
the sort of boom Canada had in the
1950 s with a major inflow of foreign
capital. But Australia’s boom would be
based on a better fundamental balance
of payments than Canada then enjoyed.
London
London, like the Continental markets,
peaked out five years ago, but has broken
(marginally and briefly) through these
peaks since then. But whereas on the
Continent these peaks represented
future hopes that have partly been
realised, in London the levels reflected
the fabulous profitability of the 1959-61
boom. Since then life has got more
difficult for British companies, and will
stay that way. So there is no reason.
The
Economist
Forecast
for 1967
looking at the progress, or lack of it,
made by the British economy since
1961, to hope for higher levels in the
near future. And, of course, London
has relapsed far less from its peak
than most other world markets, since
new classes of buyers have come into
the market in the past few years, and
as unit trust investment has expanded
so rapidly.
For the moment, the London market
seems to be able to absorb with equa-
nimity shock news of sharply reduced
profits and lower dividends from big
companies. The hope that a little
deflation could come sooner rather than
later affords an argument for buying
some stocks now, since no real quanti-
ties would be available at substantially
lower prices.
Enough institutional investors hold
this view to make it a potent temporary
force. But the real profit shockers-cum-
squeeze have not yet been reported.
Moreover, even limited reflation could
be accompanied by a wealth tax or
revision of death duties, leading to large
sales of shares in family-held companies.
The Rhodesian cloud must still hang
over markets for some time, preventing
the solid consolidation of gilt-edged
gains that must precede a true recovery
in equities. Such factors, or fears of
them, seem likely to send the market
substantially lower in the first half of
the year.
At the same time, falling industrial,
investment has already reduced the
rush for corporate debenture stocks, in-
terest rates for which have come down
by nearly a point over the last half in
1966. The funds which went into these
will now go into the many municipal
issues waiting in the wings. They will
not go into loans stock issued by com-
panies, however large, without cast-
iron asset backing for loans; these com-
panies will have to continue to make
rights issues, thus preventing any talk
of shortage of stock.

SIX YEAR'S HIGHS AND LOWS (January 1961-100) Arrows indicate latest figures
be hastened and deepened by the fact
that reflation may come later and be
more selective than the market is antici-
pating at its present levels. But the
bigger the (probable) spring fall, the
higher the (probable) autumn bounce.
London shares indices could thus be
much the same at end-1987 as they are
now.
Wall Street
Wall Street is the most chancy. Not
only because of Vietnam. With defence
expenditure increasing quite sharply
but business investment slowing down,
two old Wall Street adages should be
reliable “money flees from uncer-
tainty,” and “the market never dis-
counts a thing twice.” Well, Wall
Street spent most of 1966 fleeing pre-
cipitately from nothing more substan-
tial than uncertainty—since sales, profits,
and dividends were all sharply up. The
25 percent fall of the Dow-Jones indus-
trial average between February and
October reduced the price/earnings
ratio on the stocks sharply from the 19
level of the whole 1963/65 bull market.
Despite the recovery since October, the
ratio now is 14, the same as at the
bottom of the last bear market, when
it had slid from about'23.
Japan
In Japan, the outlook - would seem
better now than at this time last year,
although the share index is little
changed. So, although the Tokyo mar-
ket frequently gives a bumpy ride, it
should be predominantly an uphill one
during 1967. The only limitation to the
rise is that the Japanese market is
nearer its all-time high than many
Common Market ones, so has less
score for automatic recovery. Also that
the government selling agency has not
yet got rid of all the shares it stock-
piled in 1965. But sales from this source
are more likely to prevent the market
rising fast than to depress it below
its present levels, since the government
prefers to sell on a rising market.
Europe
In Germany, interest rates have re-
cently eased fractionally and the
Bundesbank is slowly relaxing its grip
on the banks. But although the average
dividend yield on German equities is
approaching five percent, extremely
high by German standards, there is
plenty for investors to chew on before
rushing into the market. The new


coalition government includes the
Socialists, who are not loved by Ger-
man investors. Business indicators are
far from favorable. On the whole 1967
will be unexciting, but the economy’s
slowing-down is already discounted by
the stock-market. So there could be
some advances in the German market
in the latter half of the year, after the
same sort of scary first half that London
will know, though London will be wor-
ried by the general trend of profits
and the economy, while the German
market will reflect more the problems
of individual companies. Some big Ger-
man companies are still in a very
illiquid state.
The French economy has been im-
proving throughout the past year. For
investors the encouraging thing is that
equity prices have not moved up to
discount the improvement. Of course,
the market’s caution is not without
foundation. Price controls on the one
hand and rising costs on the other will
erode much of the benefit that can be
derived by companies from rising out-
put. Nor was the Vallon profit-sharing
proposal encouraging. But, even so, the
scope for a rise in share prices appears
worthwhile. Its speed may depend
partly on how far the government
moves in relaxing price controls.
The Chartist says:
KING ISLAND SCHEELITE shows promise of further strong gains. The
chart, which has been reproduced back to 1960, shows the break in down-
trend and the commencement of an uptrend late in 1963 which has
taken a faster rate of appreciation from early 1965; the overall basic trend is
now 50 percent per annum. The stock appears to be breaking out of a congestion
area and a target of between $5 and $5.20 would be a distinct possibility in
the medium term. The LME wolfram price back to 1963 can be compared
with the movement in King Island Scheelite and once again a clearly estab-
lished uptrend is in evidence for the commodity price. Last sale on 5/1/67 —$2.88.

and Adelaide hope to counter
the tougher times afflicting their
industry by huge rises in brokerage
charges, other broking houses see more
future in the far more sensible course
of trying to interest their clients in
doing more business. And how do they
do that? One of the go-go-est ways for
these go-go days was last month’s cir-
cular to clients of the Melbourne
broker lan Potter and Co. Recom-
mending shares as Christmas presents
is nothing new; but recommending them
in such bright and breezy language
(putts and all) and with jazzy little
illustrations is enough to set Collins
Street’s teeth on edge. There has been
a lot of tut-tutting.

repayable 31 Dec. 1973 or 1978 respectively.
Interstate Oil Ltd. 50c. 1.26
For Mum who is always looking for that little extra to put on her back, one
might look at some of those high yielding fixed interest securities which are
still available on the market. In any event if interest rates fall (as we all hope)
some tidy capital gains are therefore to be made in this sector, and we have
chosen International Resistance 8 per cent Debentures currently available on
prospectus. If she likes a flutter, she might like a bit each way on Interstate
Oil, which is bound tp go up (and we hope not down) when drilling starts in
the wide ocean spaces of the Otway Basin.
Consolidoted Gold Fields Aust. Ltd. $l.OO 4.00 4.5 2.5
Broken Hill South Ltd. 50c. 3.05 6.1 2.9
For a strapping young son with all his life ahead of him, the gold plated
stock for 1967 should be Consolidated Gold Fields. The market is expecting
big things and with that $lO.B million sitting in the kitty from the issue, who
are we to argue? If he is more interested in what grows on the surface rather
than under the ground, you might give him Broken Hill South as this company’s
phosphate deposit in Queensland could be a winner and the gleam of copper
from Cobar should be much brighter this year.
Macquarie Broadcasting Holdings Ltd. 50c. 1.30 6.8 3.9
Victorian Broadcasting Network Ltd. 50c. 2.05 8.9 4.3
For that young kid sister, we have gone for the stocks with the swinging
sound - Macquarie Broadcasting - which we feel may still have 25 cents or more
left in it for 1967. With television advertising charges going up, radio should
prosper even more and the housewives really go for Andrea. For country coverage
in radio and T.V., V.B.N. is the stock to buy with revenues moving up nicely.
Bank of Now South Wales $2.00 5.14 7.1 3.9
For mother-in-law (whom we think has really got it stacked away) we have
chosen the Bank of New South Wales. After all, if you can’t get with the strength
because that is a Government preserve, at least you can get with the oldest
and this bank has its 150th anniversary coming up.
Carriar Air Conditioning (Holdings) Ltd. 50c. 0.60 13.1 7.5
For pa-in-law looking cool and collected in his air conditioned office,
Carrier Air seems in order. There was a large element of non-recurring expenses
in 1965/66 and with this out of the way, earnings should show a big improvement.
Carlton & United Breweries Ltd. *Z’ Shares $l.OO 2.90 7.7 4.5
For Aunt Lizzie who really enjoys her glass of Fosters, it doesn’t need
courage to suggest some Carlton and United “Z” shares at their present dep-
ressed level.
Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. $2.00 6.04 5.1 3.0
When it comes to the apple of your eye, young Junior, why not set him up
with a bit of Australia - a few shares in B.H.P. which can be added to as the
years go by. 1967 should be a very interesting year for this giant with so many
irons in the fire.
The Myer Emporium Ltd. 50c. 3.05 6.1 2.9
Although not strictly one of the family, we know how indispensable your
devoted secretary is, so only the best is good enough for her. She understands
the meaning of “value and friendly service” too and a holding in Myers may cut
down her window shopping time and get her back to work within the hour.
Well, having solved all your Christmas gift problems, we close with the wish that in 1967 all your
losses may be little ones.
The Editor is going to have a well earned rest over Christmas, and the next issue of the Fortnightly
Review will appear on January 19.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
In last week’s lively markets some signs of profit-taking be-
came evident toward the close. Thus a few early favorites
shed a little bloom. Even BHP, which sold up well during
the week, could manage only a 2 cent overall advance to end
at $6.56. Strong at first, Minster dropped a net 5 cents to $3,
while keenly sought Henry Jones did not hold its gains and
finished unchanged at $4. Howard Smith, though, posted a
bright 17 cents on the week to touch $2.94. Among the rather
uneven miners, New BH stood out with a 30 cent jump; CRA
excelled this by advancing 36 cents.

MAN ON THE LAND
Wool Marketing—A New Plan
THE depressing feature of many
primary produce marketing
schemes, both in Australia and
overseas, is that the genuine farmer
discovers, too late, that he gets the
green end <>f the strawberry. The rich
fruit goes lo the bureaucrats and the
corporations engaged in farming on a
mammoth scale.
In Australia we may observe, for ex-
ample, the Wheat Board which func-
tions with efficiency and commendable
lack of ostentation. At the other ex-
treme we have the State Egg Boards,
all duplicating each other, and all,
seemingly, upholders of Parkinson’s
Law. In between there are dozens of
marketing boards operating with vary-
ing degrees of skill. The only general
rule that can be applied is that once
established they never diminish in
scale.
It is with these thoughts in mind that
we now discuss a new plan for the
marketing of wool put forward by Mr.
William McLean, of Adelaide. Our
preliminary remarks are necessary, we
feel, for the merit of a plan itself is no
guarantee that it will gain acceptance.
A bad plan, if it happens to suit the
job seekers, often has a better chance.
Mr. McLean’s plan, as a plan,
appears to have merit. He has been a
woolbuyer for 48 years and is also a
woolgrower. In essence it is an ap-
praisement plan. First, an authority
would be created to enable any un-
typeable lots of wool to be reclassed.
No huge bureaucratic authority would
be required for this. It could be carried
out by a panel of four qualified clas-
sers in each State who would inspect
every lot and report to growers on the
quality of the classing or otherwise.
With the classing under control, a body
of appraisers would value each lot.
M R McLEAN contends that to do
this some 70 valuers (the best in
the trade) would be needed. This seems
a moderate number and possibly critics
of his scheme might argue that 70 is
insufficient. However, let Mr. McLean
have his say. The finance to pay for
this group, he says, would come from a
0.5 percent charge on every invoice.
Such a charge would raise approxi-
mately $3 million annually.
The next step would be to have each
bale core tested as it comes into store.
With the clean wool content typed, plus
core testing, Australian and overseas
mills would operate with fuller con-
fidence and the resultant price at
auction would improve, he says.
Fluctuation would likewise be mini-
mised. Mills with more efficient machi-
nery could work on a higher premium.
This, of course, is a brief outline of
Mr. McLean’s plan. The beauty of it
is that the industry could put it into
operation itself, without danger of take-
over by bureaucrats.
The critic would naturally ask why
such a scheme has not been considered
before; and would add that if it was
any good it would have been put to
growers instead of the reserve price
plan.
Not so. And for interesting, if im-
ponderable, reasons. Mr. McLean’s plan
is not far off the appraisement system
considered, but not recommended, by
the Philp Committee in 1962. It (the
Philp Report) said that central
appraisement appeared to “raise possi-
bilities for improving the marketing of
Australian wool.”
In general terms again, the central
appraisement system, as considered by
the Philp Committee, would involve
agreement among woolbuyers to ap-
point a team of permanent salaried
appraisers to value wool according to
a predetermined table of types and
descriptions. After appraisement the
wool would be sent to bulk stores.
The cost of this scheme would be borne
by the woolbuyers on some basis of
sharing.
Among the advantages claimed for
this (Philp Committee) appraisement
system were: savings in costs through
elimination of detailed floor display;
a closer supervision of the standard of
preparation of the clip, and more
orderly feeding of wool to the auction
floor. Disadvantages were mentioned
also. The main, and probably over-
riding, disadvantage was that “at this
point in time” (1962) denial of right
of inspection would not find favor
among buyers and would result in
less competition.
'J'HE point which arises in 1967 is
that buyers may possibly have re-
vised this opinion if they ever held
it. We have ’always held the view that
the reserve price system, in the original
Hitchens - Simpson - Campbell form*
would have stood a reasonable chance
of gaining acceptance from both the
woolgrowers and the trade. There were
important differences in the reserve
price plan as put to growers by the
Wool Board.
The original plan would not have
given the bureaucrats much
although, certainly, a wool authority
(i.e., board) would have been neces-
sary. But the clause in the Wool Board
plan, which was not in the legislation,
and was therefore never discussed
openly, was the arrangement between
the Board, the executive of the Wool
Industry Conference, and the Depart-
ment of Primary Industry, relating
to disposal of bought-in wools. This
agreement would have permitted sale
(by the authority) of bought-in wools
“in special circumstances” outside the
auction system.
AGRISEARCH
Engineers for Agriculture
FOLLOWING hard on the heels of
Farquhar, whose book “Agricul-
tural Education in Australia” (8.,
October 1) sketched the general malaise,
Mr. A. K. Turner has now detailed
the particular inadequacies of training
in agricultural engineering. Writing in
the latest issue of the Journal of the
Australian Institute of Agricultural
Science, he points out that the engineer-
ing side of agriculture gets short shrift
in the educational courses offered at
both the colleges and the universities.
At only one university, Melbourne,
do agricultural science students have
the opportunity of rubbing shoulders
with an engineer on the faculty. “Many
agricultural science students graduate
(in Australia) without ever having had
contact with an engineering specialist
in their course,” he says. The position
is nearly as bad in the agricultuial col-
leges Only about half of them have
a professional engineer on their staff.
rpL I, & •
Ihe colleges are supposed to tram
people specifically for \he food process-
ing industries, selling and servicing
machinery and equipment, and other
careers in soil and water conservation
which depend heavily on either civil or
mechanical engineering.
The Americans reckon that their
effort is nothing to be proud of. Yet
their educational system produces one
agricultural engineering graduate for
every 25 other agricultural graduates.
To equal this, Australia should be turn-
ing out up to 20 trained agricultural
engineers a year. We produced four
last year and may get another seven
toward the end of this year if every-
one passes his final exams. It is no
wonder, then, that, whereas at one time
Australia led the world in agricultural
engineering, we now have to accept,
or slavishly copy, the machinery sent
to us from the U.S.A., England, and
Europe. England, with its 20-year-old
National Institute of Agricultural
Engineering, has been providing con-
siderable encouragement for this
essential profession,
To be surC) W e are still not entirely
bereft of enterprise. Massey Ferguson,
for instance has begun to market a
~, • ,
sugar cane harvester which owes noth-
. . , c , , ,
in § to overseas ldeas - Several ?°\ er and
other pasture seed harvesters lately pro-
duced by Horwood Bagshaw, Barrow
Linton, and John Dickerson Pty. Ltd.
have also been contrived locally. These
inventions, like our celebrated earlier
efforts, which included such revolution-

A far cry from plumbing to surgery? Not for polypropylene! It’s
orobably the most versatile of all Shell Chemical plastics. Its
chemical inertness; ability to withstand autoclaving; its strength
and light weight make it perfect for trouble-free, low-cost plumbing
and disposable surgical equipment, like gallipots!
And Shell Chemical scientists are finding new uses every day for
polypropylene and other equally exciting materials such as poly-
urethane. That’s how Shell Chemical research works making
better chemical products for almost every industry and purpose.

Shell Chemicals
ary agricultural machines as the
stripper, have been mothered by neces-
sity. Such crude motivation is not likely
to provide the refinements desired in a
sophisticated age.
Agriculture in the future is going to
become vastly more mechanised and the
little native talent that still exists here
will be quite unable to keep up. In-
creasing numbers of professionally
trained engineers who understand the
biological world of agriculture and who
can work in groups and teams will be
needed. Though the lone inventive
genius of the Ridley type will always
find a place, the future emphasis will be
co-operative planning and design.
The highly efficient agriculture of
the future will want, say, tillage
machines that truly function in accord-
ance with the principles of soil science
and root and shoot growth. Many horti-
cultural crops are already being geneti-
cally tailored by the biologists to lend
themselves to machine harvesting, e.g.,
some cotton varieties now bear all their
bolls at the top of the plant. Tomatoes,
potatoes, and so on are now being made
more uniform in size and shape to suit
the specifications of engineers.
B UT machine design is only one
corner of the field of agricultural
engineering. Buildings, farm water sup-
ply, fencing, the transport and handling
of materials and products, erosion con-
trol, drainage, and irrigation can all be
improved by the application of en-
gineering knowledge. The selection and
integration of a farm’s whole plant and
machinery pose complex problems. Be-
cause he has some appreciation of farm
management and economics, an agricul-
tural engineer could provide valuable
help in sorting out the choices and
questions involved. The Departments
of Agriculture should have groups able
to give this kind of advice at least.
Studies have shown that the average
farm is over-capitalised on plant. While
this may be a somewhat arbitrary judg-
ment, whether our farms are or are
not over-capitalised, the engineering
costs amount to a large proportion of
the total cost of production. Even a
sheep farm in a pastoral zone expends
29 percent of its total running costs on
its equipment and 26 percent of its
capital value exists in its machinery
and constructions. Ironically, the live-
stock on whose account the hardware
exists is worth less. This is even more
true of a dairy farm. It might be rea-
sonably argued, therefore, that we
should be putting our main education
effort into training engineers instead
of biologists of one sort or another.
If greater poignancy need be added
to Mr. Turner’s remarks, it is provided
in several other articles on different
aspects of agricultural engineering in
the same issue of the Journal. One, for
instance, in discussing potato harvesting
mentions en passant that several lifting
forks being offered to farmers are so
badly designed that they threaten life
and limb.


Chess Bulletin
YURI AVERBAKH
GRANDMASTER Yuri Aver-
bakh, twice champion of
the U.S.S.R., is scheduled to
arrive in Melbourne on Wednes-
day, January 18. From then until
February 18 he will be visiting
all Australian capital cities (ex-
cepting Perth and Darwin) and
many large country towns, where
he will be giving simultaneous
exhibitions and in some cases
lectures.
This is the second Australian
visit by Averbakh. The first was
in 1960 when he completed an
equally exhaustive tour and in-
cluded the Australian Champion-
ship in his itinerary. He won this
from a strong field but, of course,
was not eligible for the title.
Prior to starting his tour this
year, the eminent visitor took
part in the Canterbury (N.Z.)
Centenary Tournament in which
he is regarded as the certain
winner.
To carry out such a strenuous
campaign one would need to be
in excellent physical condition,
and it is doubtful if any other
chess Grandmaster in the World
would equal Averbakh in this
regard. He is 44
years of age, is 6 feet 4 inches
in height, and he gives one the
impression that here is a well-
trained athlete (which he prob-
ably is) rather than a chess
Grandmaster.
Well, here is the opportunity
for any ordinary player except
those in the Western States to
match wits with such a man. His
itinerary will be well publicised
in the daily papers together with
complete details.
The following game occurred in
1954 in a match between U.S.S.R.
and Argentina and is an excel-
lent example of Averbakh’s com-
binative skill.
White: Y. Averbakh.
Black: O. Panno.
Opening: King’s Indian.
1. P-Q4, N-KB3; 2. P-QB4, P-KN 3;
3. N-QB3, B-N2; 4. P-K4, P-Q3; 5.

P-QR 3; 8. P-QR 4, Q-R4; 9. B-Q2,
P-K4.
Much better is 9 . . . P-K3. The
text move blocks the centre, allows
White an opportunity to launch a K-
side attack and reduces the usefulness
of Black’s Queen.
10. P-KN 4, N-Kl; 11. P-R4, P-84.
Black’s position does not lend itself
to counter attack. Better to return the
Queen back home.
12. P-R5, P-B5; 13. P-N5, R-B2; 14.
B-N4, Q-Ql; 15. Bxß, Qxß; 16. N-83,
B-Bl; 17. K-K2.
With the centre so blocked and
Black’s pieces all tied up, Averbakh
sees no point in leaving the Kang on
the back line.
17 . . . R-N2; 18. R-R4, N-Q2; 19. PxP,
PxP; 20. Q-Rl, B-K2.
Better is 20 . . . K-82, which he is
forced to do next move anyway.
21. R-RBch, K-B2; 22. Q-R6, N-Bl; 23.
R-Rl, QR-Nl.
Black seems to have established a
fairly sound defence, so Averbakh
breaks open the position with some
beautiful combinational play.
24. BxP, Q-82.
If 24 . . . Pxß; 25. R-R4 with all sorts
of nasty threats.
25. Q-R2, N-Q2; 26. Q-R3, N-81.
Nothing like the threat of mate in
one to send the troops scurrying back.
27. RxNch! KxR; 28. Q-K6, R-Nl; 29.
N-R4! B-Ql; 30. NxPch, K-N2.
Panno has no alternative. If 30 . . .
RxN; 31. R-RBch, K-N2; 32. Q-N8
mate.
31. NxP, resigns.

SPECULATORS DIARY
A Cleaning-up Operation
I ENDED my diary in 1966 by wishing everyone a prosperous New Year. If
the stock market’s behaviour in the first few days of 1967 is any indication
of what is to come, then my wishes have not been in vain.
While I was making merry in the
sun, the portfolio was pushing steadily
ahead. In less than two weeks the value
was up by a cool $5OO. A couple of
performances deserve special mention.
First of all, L. J. Hooker, by rising a
mere 5 cents, caused a $l5O increase.
Then United Uranium, which had been
lagging behind the rest of the market,
suddenly jumped 8 cents. Another $BO
added to the portfolio. An equally
pleasing rise was that of Mt. Morgan,
which moved up from $3.10 to $3.38.
With a record half-year coming up
through a combination of increased
production and high copper prices, I’ll
be holding on to Mt. Morgan for
the time being. Other irons in the fire
for the company include the possible
application of the by-product pyrites
in manufacturing sulphuric acid and
the iron ore project.
On the other hand, I’ve decided to
take the profit of $54 on the United
Uranium. Once the current interest in
uranium wanes, it’s quite possible that
the shares will fall back to the low
fifties and I’ll probably step in again.
I also decided to sell the Pye Indus-
tries, so adding a further $46 to the
kitty. Higher sales but a lower pro-
fit in the first six months is not likely
to initiate any additional improvement
in the market.
In this mass cleaning-up operation,
I decided to remove two of the heavy-
weights from the portfolio. Only a few
dollars loss on the Ansett, but H. C.
Sleigh cut heavily into the accumulated
profits by recording a $74 loss.
The rapid build up of a credit
balance in the account gives plenty of
room for buying. First of all, there’s
Waugh and Josephson. If the indus-
trial market is going to remain firm,
the pastoral industry and anyone con-
nected with it will be in the forefront.
As Waugh and Josephson is one of the
major suppliers of farm equipment in
N.S.W., they as much as any other in-
dustrial company deserve attention.
With the widespread drought, one
might have expected a heavy fall in
profits last year. Instead, profit edged
up slightly and dividend rate was raised
from 8 to 9 percent. All credit must
go to the Caterpillar operations.
The market has not altogether over-
looked this stock. Holding steady at
$2 early in December, the shares sud-
denly put on 30 cents. I’m buying 300
on the rebound, at an average price of
$2.24.
The first mining stock to enter the
portfolio in 1967 is King Island
Scheelite. At $2.90 I’m paying just
about top price. But if ever a stock
follows a commodity price, this is it.
It was touch and go whether wolfram
was going through the 300 s a unit level.
Those who felt it unlikely based their
views on the possibility of a substan-
tial release from the G.S.A. stockpile.
As it turned out, the price hardly
paused at 300 s a unit. The continued
absence of China as a seller and in-
creased European demand have pushed
it up to 330 s a unit. What could trigger
this price off to even greater heights
was the fire last week at Tungsten,
Canada. A mill capable of producing
4 million lb. of tungsten a year was
burnt down, causing the operation to be
closed for several months.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
100 H. C. Sleigh 57 $558
1000 United Uranium 64 $627
500 Ansett 60 $294
500 Pye 1.03 $505
BOUGHT
300 Waugh and Josephson 2.24 $6BO
308 King Island Scheelite 2.90 $B9O
Temporarily at any rate, the port-
folio is in pretty good shape. The stock
to be watched most closely is Wood-
side.

In the land that invented business flying
the British have sold
20% of the new generation business jets.
Americans and Canadians have so far bought
more than 60 Hawker Siddeley business jets. On
average, world membership of this exclusive club
has grown at the rate of one a week.
The Americans have a vigorous home industry for
executive jets. But they are finding that the British
125 has exactly the right recipe for business flying.
It seats up to 8 passengers and has the most
headroom of any of the twin jets. It has a range
of 1,500 miles and speed up to 500 mph. And
with the new, more powerful Bristol Siddeley 522
turbojets it has an even better payload and hot and
high performance. What’s more, the 125 is built by
the Company with the world's longest experience of
building civil jets.
Big enough. Fast enough. Competitively priced.
This simple formula is giving the HSI2S its phenom-
enal sales growth in the world’s toughest and
most discriminating market
