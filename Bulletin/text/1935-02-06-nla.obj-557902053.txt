The Week's Best:—
THE TRUTH
ABOUT
GENERAL BOOTH
As with all
great leaders,
there swirled
kbout General
William Booth in
his lifetime such
a cloud of prejudice that impartial
and critical judgment of his aims and
achievements was difficult to come by.
Even such bird’s-eye essayists of per-
sonalia as A. G. Gardiner were not quite
remote enough from the controversies to
do justice.
Of full-length biographies there were,
up till recently, but two. That of George
S. Railton, first Salvation Army Com-
missioner, bears the Army’s badge, and
is frankly a panegyric, brimming over
with expressions of evangelical zeal and
telling the soldiers and lassies for whom
it was written nothing more than the
“War Cry” had already vouchsafed to
them. Harold Begbie ? s larger work is
a more sophisticated appreciation, for
which the Army paid £4OOO. St. John
An example of the abusive cartoons of
Booth and his ideas which were aimed at
the General early in his career.
Ervine, who now comes into the field
with two solid volumes, the fruit of six
years of documentary research, was never
intimate with the General; only saw him
twice, and as a member of audiences.
The Irish playwright belongs to a class
which Booth regarded as dedicated to
the Devil, and Ervine’s God’s Soldier
(Heinemann; two vols.; 365. net.)
is never likely to receive the Salvation
Army imprimatur. It is, however, a
vastly finer tribute to the genius, hero-
ism and saintliness of its subject than
its less discriminating predecessors.
Geniuses, heroes*or saipts whose work
brings them into the hurly-burly of con-
troversy are seldom so acclaimed by any
considerable proportion of their con-
temporaries. As a rule, they constitute
a new pattern, and don’t conform to con-
ventional and recognisable standards.
Especially was William Booth a new
pattern, but he looked, at first, so much
like a very old one, and that old one
a subject of odium and derision. A
pawnbroker’s assistant with very few
advantages of education—he knew little
more than his Bible and the life of the
slums —he became at an early age what
Ervine calls “God-infested” ; filled with
a driving burning fever to preach his
literal and narrow gospel, and to carry
what he firmly believed to be a saving
grace into the lives of the lowest, most de-
graded and most unhappy paupers. He
cut away from the Methodist New Con-
nexion because it hesitated to allow him
complete freedom as a “revivalist,” and
was not in complete sympathy with his
belief in the efficacy of hysterical emo-
tion induced by fear of hellfire.
Ervine does not gloss over Booth’s
repellent aspects: his illiteracy ; his igno-
rance of and contempt for the thousand
and one aspects of philosophy, aesthetics
and even religion which lay outside his
ambit; his utter lack of humor; the
arrogance which drove him to attempt
to found a sort of Holy Dynasty of
Booths, and which is reflected in the
family name tacked by a hyphen on to
the husbands of his daughters. But a
man must be judged on aims and results
rather than on accidentals of character
and heredity, and his latest biographer is
unshakable in his testimony to the
purity and selflessness of Booth’s aims,
and to the effectiveness of his work. “We
want the lowest of the low,” said Booth
on one occasion, “and we will sweep the
sewers for them.” He got them. By
his own seemingly irrational recipe he
got them, and he made them not only
decent and respectable persons of high
principle, but overwhelmingly happy
people to boot.
Ervine’s judgment, based almost wholly
on documentary evidence, must be,
present writer thinks, the judgment of
all who have come into actual contact
with the Salvation Army and its works;
who have taken the trouble to investi-
gate the slanders that have surrounded
its labors, and who have had some op-
portunity of estimating the spirit that
drives these ill-paid, hard-working men
and women. Policemen and
at early stages the Army’s most cynical
critics, have become, because their noses
were rubbed into the mission’s work, its
staunchest friends.
Nor did Booth’s work, in his life-
time, lack the help and the advice (the
latter seldom heeded) of great men far
outside the Army. Cardinal Manning,
Archbishop Davidson, Gladstone, John
Morley, W. T. Stead, King Edward VII.,
Labouchere, Winston
Churchill, Lloyd
George, even Bernard
Shaw, found in this un-
dignified tub-thumping
evangelist and his fol-
lowers an electric spark
that ignited their sym-
pathies.
Now that the Army
has lost its first general
it has fallen on troub-
lous times. Ervine deals
with an impression that
it is becoming too gen-
teel. “It has become,”
he says in his perora-
tion, “more respectable
than Booth wished it to
be, but it has not lost
its contact with the poor
or its ability to give
them that dilatation of
joy which is religion.
Its young officers, be-
wildered and dismayed
by the acts of their
elders- in 1929, have
turned with more de-

are resolved to keep themselves immune

A Strong
Australian
Novel
F. S. Kibble’s
notable novel of
N.S.W. Not t h
Coast farming
life, Karangi (En-
deavour Press ;
65.), which tied with Vance Palmer’s The
Swayne Family for first place in the Mel-
bourne centenary competition, would
seem to satisfy the main conditions de-
manded recently of Australian novels by
English critics, including Jonathan Gape
and Frank Swinnerton, the one a pub-
lisher of originality and daring, the other
an experienced publisher’s reader and
practised novelist. They unite in empha-
sising naturalness and sincerity of treat-
ment —Mr. Cape says to be natural and
unashamed —and a fidelity to the main
stream of the English novel, which
means having a good story to tell.
Because if is sincerely and, in a
number of passages, more than ordi-
narily well written, vivid in its realism,
and compelling as a narrative, Karangi
is well worth while, quite apart from its
local appeal as an authoritative impres-
sion of life and landscape in its pj c .
turesque setting.
Phil Jessop, after 12 years in Sydney
returns to Karangi Creek, where he had
once gone to school and flirted with
Mary Mcßeady, to find the 20-year-old
Mary betrothed to a middle-aged brute
of a widower whose driving desire, when
he is not aching for first prizes for his
pedigree Jersey bulls, is to father a son.
Prompted and urged on by her parents
the girl marries the ambitious suitor, it
is a pleasure to state at once that he
proves sterile.
It is hard to bottle-
up one’s disgust at the
thought of the selfish
and mercenary M c -
Readys forcing Mary
into an alliance like
this, a form of child,
slavery which may be
understandable in such
a locality and under
such primitive condi-
tions as described by
Bernard Cronin in The
Sow’s Ear, but not in a
place like Karangi
Creek. Nor is it much
easier to contain one’s
impatience with Mary
for her bovine accept-
ance of what she well
knew would be a hate-
ful existence. After
three years of it, a
temporary escape is
opened to her by a
worldly-wise medico’s
wife who has taken pity
on her The two of
them leave for a holi-
day in Sydney, and while there Mary and
Phi! come together once more. In the
meantime, poetic justice is visited on the
husband. The clima' to the story is un-
expected and tragic. It could !so easily,
in an inferior hand, have been conven-
tional and happy.
Beyond a little juggling by Dr. Billy
Jarman and Pet, his not' unlikeable wife,
with the small change of wit and an
occasional laugh, there is little of a light-
some nature by way of contrast to the
sombre note. Among the landscape
passages you meet with some fine
images: “... .ringbarked trees that stood
clean-boled and skeleton-pale with gaunt
arms upstretched to the blue heavens-
like athletes appealing to Caesar.” Also:
“There was a lazy solemnity in this bush-
land, the very trees seeming to be busy
tidying their leaves and branches and
settling for the nighr.” ’
The domestic and outdoor phases of
life are well observed and expressed
truthfully, with the eloquence that comes
of knowledge. The impression that
abides after reading Karangi is one of
“quickness,” as D, H, Lawrence once
phrased it during a discussion on the
novel. You* feel you have been at close

20,000 MOTORISTS
HAVE TESTED THIS CAR
ALL OVER THE WORLD
AND FOUND IT GOOD
r y
N rough roads and winding highways, on
tropical desert-trails and scorching prairie tracks.
Standard cars have been rigidly, ruthlessly, searchingly
tested, tried and proven. By over 20,000 motorists all
through 1934, the tour Standard models were found
so good, so utterly dependable, so fast and yet so
sate in their performance, that the Standard engineers
decided to carry on the same models tor 1935, making
only slight changes, adding only the few improve-
ments they wisely considered essential.
So the English Standard car you buy in 1935 is no
untried experiment. It is a car that has proven
its inbuilt quality and its satisfying road performance,
its wonderful riding comfort.
Standards again offer you " Buoyant Power" - a
patent flexible engine mounting that gives complete
freedom from vibration by insulating
the power unit from the chassis
and body.
AGAIN they give you Silent Synchro-Mesh Gears
in Top, 3rd and 2nd—and this combined with Controlled
Free-Wheeling. Again there is Startix Automatic
Re-starting for convenience and safety. There is
the strong X-braced Chassis Frame; Bendix Duo-
Servo Brakes; Compensated Voltage Control and other
features that are neither seen nor heard, but contribute
none the less to the efficiency of the car's performance.
Coachwork is distinctive in style, graceful in line,
brilliant in colour harmony, smartly appointed and
finished in craftsman-like manner.
These splendid Standards are now on display awaiting
your inspection and your trial run.
Four tested, tried and proven models. The "Nine/'
"Ten,” "Twelve" and "Twenty." All are
available in extremely smart
Roadster, Tourer, Coupe and Saloon
body-styles.

H.ARANGI
By F. S. NIBBLE.
With this arresting realistic novel Mr. Hibble shared with Vance Palmer
First Prize in the Melbourne Centenary Novel Competition. As sincere
and authentic a novel as the Endeavour has yet published, it has tor
setting the rich and in many ways picturesque North Coast ot N.b.w.,
and for the theme the study of a girl who, though she loves deeply and
despises her parents’ marriage schemes on her behalf, allows herself to
drift into an arranged-marriage existence with a wealthy farmer oosessea
by a futile ambition to beget a son; her temporary escape through a
friendship with the woman-of-the-world wife of the local doctor, and the
relighting of the old flame of passion during a visit to the city. Ihe
author spent years in the country he deals with, and he describes this
phase of its life faithfully and accurately.

■ ns with the soil and with life ; not life
g t K s pleasantest, but certainly with what
s v ital and quick, not what is dead.
CAMDEN MORRISBY.
The
Australian
Fictioneer
Perhaps it may
take the edge off
“D.P.M.’s” wrath
(R.P. 9/1 /’35) if
I remind him
that, in attempt-
ing to express the low, common, money
side of the writing game, I am con-
cerned not with the art of writing, but
with the trade of fictioneering.
Great genius (I leave “D.P.M.” to de-
fine it) is in a class by itself. Its pos-
sessor may walk with kings or starve
on the dole, be a model citizen or the
scandal of the town, be exploited by
humbugs while he is alive and debunked
by pretentious asses when he is dead.
Sooner or later he comes into his own,
throned and secure in the hearts of his
fellows, and, for the purposes of this
discussion, may well be left there.
My hints were designed to help the
Australian fictioneer who has found his
feet in the home market and is per-
plexed by repeated failure to make his
wares appetising for overseas consump-
tion. In setting himself out deliberately
to please his masters the public, he need
not feel ashamed of the company in
which he finds himself. Robert Louis
Stevenson, flogging his exhausted body
to its daily task of 5000 words (and
dying of apoplexy), was not the victim of
his own genius. He needed the money.
Scott, his probity assailed, his creditors
clamoring, the very foundations of his
life crumbling beneath his feet, wrote —
with both eyes on his readers —for
money. Jack London, turning out his
modest thousand daily words when he
ought to have been in bed, was only in-
cidentally expressing his own personal
and particular views of life —which every
writer must have to keep his public—-
he, too, was not above considering the
money side of his craft. And, to descend
a great deal (if “D.P.M.” will have it so),
Edgar Wallace martyred himself to keep
the bailiffs at bay.
The same intense desire to produce
immediate financial results in the short-
est possible space of time may be ob-
served in many another star of the
literary firmament.
Now, consider the handicaps under
which the Australian writer has to
struggle. He earns an income at which
artisans and clerks would scoff ; his hours
of labor behind his typewriter would
cause union bosses to declare unending
strikes; in his own market he is com-
peting, without any protection whatso-
ever, against the best brains of the
world; his own countrymen prefer the
work of outsiders to his, and, though his
wife may assure him that genius glitters
in every line he writes, his friends per-
sist in regarding him as an unexplain-
able eccentric.
It is to London and New York that
he must look for emancipation, and, suc-
cessfully to compete in those overcrowded
marts, he must have a story to tell, and
he must tell it in a way acceptable to
his readers. London still makes a writer,
though New York enriches him.
He will find, as many of us have
found, that the man who borrows his
hooks from the circulating library and
looks for his name in the magazines is,
m s P lte of the sneers of superior persons,
£ ver Y decent fellow. He hates to be
bemused and bedevilled, puzzled and de-
pressed by Dismal Jimmies, and knows
very well when he is being humbugged
Y fakirs with a good press. To him,
th nter s i°b is to help him to forget
c featurelessness of life’s trivial
round, to relieve the tedium of a long
runway journey, to make extortionate
tax-collectors appear less menacing and
shady politicians less real.
The pity of it is that he does not care
much for Australian stories. Perhaps
“D.P.M.” can tell us why.
The retort that he is an ass is no
answer.
TAUWARRA.
Solving the
Author’s
Problem
One of the
reasons, perhaps
the main reason,
why the Austra-
lian novelist is
not getting a fair
return for his work is the circulating
library.
A big library will put as many as 25
copies of a new novel on its shelves. It
has been estimated that these 25 copies
are issued at least 10,000 times, at first
on a daily-rental basis, then, when the
book’s popularity diminishes, on a
weekly basis. They pay for themselves
many times over and return a handsome
profit to the librarian. The author, how-
ever, the poor simpleton whose only pur-
pose in the scheme of things was to
write the book, gets his royalty—7£d.
a copy—on the first sale of 25 copies.
Every time a gramophone record of a
song, or the song itself, is sung or per-
formed in public, either on a concert
platform or over the air, it has to be
paid for. The Musical and Performing
Rights Association has seen to it that the
geniuses who gave to the world such
gems as “Yes, We Have No Bananas”
and “There’s an Old Spinning-wheel in
the Parlor” have reaped the fruits of
their labors. The Australian film indus-
try is about to be given the benefit of
a quota system. If this can be done for
music and movies something can also
be done for the novel (and the novelist).
The reader must be protected, and no
obstacles should be placed in the way of
reading matter at a cheap price. But it
is not fair to expect the author and the
publisher to carry the baby all the time.
The scheme which suggests itself as a
solution to the problem is one which
will make the villain of the piece pay
his share, and since he has gathered
most of the plums he should not find it
difficult to look pleasant.
The formation of an Australian
Authors’ Royalty Protection Association,
with Governmental authority to impose
a surcharge every time a book is issued
by a library, is the only way out. It
should not be hard to devise and police
a stamp system.
In this way the public will not be un-
duly inconvenienced, the librarian, after
paying his just dues, will still be able to
carry on, the publisher will get some
slight degree of recompense for the risk
he takes, and the writer, who is, after
all, the most important person, will be
given a little more encouragement to
get on with the job of developing the
Australian novel.

Humor
Competition
Prizes
For The Bul-
letin Humorous
Story Competi-
tion 417 entries
were in hand at
the closing date,
January 31.
The conditions of the competition
were: Entries, which could be short
stories, narrative sketches or essays,
were not to exceed 2500 words. One
entry (in verse) exceeded this by more
than 20,000. Forty-eight exceeded it
by 1000 to 3000 words. The youngest
age disclosed by entrants was 13 years,
but several others may have been
younger. .
Prizes; First, £l5; second, £7 ; third,
£3. All entries accepted to be paid for
at Bulletin rates in addition to any
prize-money that might be won.
The judges —D. H. Souter, J. C. Bancks
and Tom Mutch—have been reading the
accepted ones as they have appeared
from week to week in The Bulletin.
They have now been given the other
entries, and will make their choice from
these unpublished ones and all those that
have been published. Obviously, with
so many entries, this task will occupy
them for several weeks. Their judgment
will appear in The Bulletin immediately
after its announcement; then all re-
jected manuscripts to which stamps were
attached will be returned.
The Bulletin quest for stories,
sketches or essays with a laugh in them
does not stop with this competition.
Stories, etc., of the kind, on the lines
of those this competition has brought
forth, will be welcomed. The Bulletin
wants one a week.
A Satchel of Books
In Blind Mouths (Barker ; 8s. 6d.) T.
F. Tweed has amalgamated the Southern
European States fronting the Danube and
placed them under a Dictator. The cen-
tral figure, however, is Johann Zimri, a
medical evangelist who roams the coun-
try accomplishing miracles of healing and
scattering the seeds of his doctrine —a
modern setting for a theme 2000 years
old. The author sets out to prove
through the tragic destiny of “The
Healer” that the world of to-day with
it's warring creeds and politics and in-
flammable public opinion would inevit-
ably cause history to repeat itself.
The Last Post (Blackwood; 8s. 6d.
net), posthumous work of Sir John
Fortescue, late Librarian to the King
at Windsor and Historian of the
British Army, has an introduction by
Guedalla, who pays tribute to Fortes-
cue’s ability, versatility and industry. The
book contains Fortescue’s Raleigh lec-
ture on “The British Soldier and the
Empire,” the Romanes lecture on “The
Vicissitudes of Organised Power,” an in-
formative contribution on English mili-
tary music, the story of the famous
Napiers—Charles, George and William ;
all fine soldiers and all famous for physi-
cal prowess, intellectual power and eccen-
tric behavior—and a hitherto-unpublished
account of the “sideshow” of Guadeloupe
in the “Year of Victory” of the elder
Pitt, 1759. All sorts of intriguing infor-
mation crops up in it. Uncommonly
good.
Music Making, by Marjorie G. Davies
(London Uni. Press, our copy from
Dymocks ; 3s. 6d.) is not a disquisition
on theories of composition, but deals
with the musical education of school-
children aged from 3to 11. Music used
to be the worst-taught subject in the
primary curriculum. Under a teacher
such as Miss Davies, who has the prin-
ciples of Montessori and Froebel at her
fingertips, loves teaching and loves
music, it ought to be easily the best-
taught. “There is a side of music,” she
says, “which cannot be fully appreciated
until one has tried to express it in some
way.” That’s very true. A worth-while
composer is able to write down only half
his intention. He depends on the sym-
pathy and intelligence of the executant
to supply the other half. Miss Davies
covers every phase of school music, in-
cluding percussion bands, tonic sol fa,
French rhythm notation, descant singing
and enunciation. She justifies the title
of her book by making a strong plea for
allowing children to invent tunes of their
own, and gives a great deal of wise ad-
vice as to how this phase of musical
training can be guided and encouraged.
Native Trees of Australia, by James
Wales Audas (Whitcombe and Tombs).
An interesting record of those native
Australian trees which tourists delight in
and most Australians know very little
about. The author points out that there
are in Australia 1200 species of gums
and wattles, not to mention 300 species
unrelated to either. It will be news to
most that Australian trees shed their
leaves in winter, and abundantly, though
they retain a large proportion of their
foliage.
Patrick H. Ritchie, a
young Dubbo farmer,
bumped hard luck
when the depression
came along. A chance
meeting induced him to
volunteer as a lay
helper in the Mission
of the Sacred Heart on
Bathurst Island in n.-w.
Australia. What he
did there and how he
came to extend his in-
tended stay of one year
to four is set out in
North of the Never
Never, written in col-
laboration with Henry
B. Raine (Angus and
Robertson; 65.). His
activities included the
laying-out and cultiva-
tion of a model farm,
the capture and taming
of a herd of dairy
cattle that had gone
bush a generation be-
fore, the introduction
to the island of horses
and the training of
myall blacks as agricul-
turists, dairymen and
-maids, cattlemen and
horsemen. Like most
of those who have
lived close to the un-
con t a minated abo.,
Ritchie has a high
opinion of his ability,
industry and intelli-
gence. There are many
fine photographs, and
the book is a valuable
contribution to the
literature of n.-w. Aus-
tralia.
IF I.
If I should come to be an old man, worn
As a thin, tattered cloth, yet unappeased
Of this strange love of living: pleased, displeased
With trifles, but aware of the grey morn,
Ever and unremittingly aware
Of the grey morn that will not find me here :
If I should come to be an old man \nown
As famous men are \nown, a silly name
On many silly tongues, for praise and blame
Some four or five to judge what I have done,
Some four or five of all the tribes of earth
Who guess at what I strove for, try its worth :
If I should come to be an old man, one
Survivor of dead years, a harmless ghost
Who some few hours longer than the most
Saved from the dar\ may linger in the sun :
I should remember all these heats of mine
No more than as vain shadows in the day’s decline.
My life that should be shaped and rounded whole
To fit completion, it may sometimes serve
An old man s anecdotes, a postured role
Of senile vanities, if I deserve
No more of time than time’s soon-withered wreaths.
Time has no present and no future, no
Reality save the poor mirror-show
Where all life fades even as it moves and breathes.
And this sweet fury and this ardent rage
Of love, this rose of flame shall no more be
Than some dim memory in a dotard’s age,
And I a shell which murmurs of the sea.
I might raise up a palace with great walls
Of porphyry and marble, and, such vast
Titanic labor ended, roam at last,
Deserted, old and lost, through darkening halls.
S.A.

RAILWAYS AND ROADS.
Joseph Cook, a former Prime Minister,
supplied the “S. M. Herald” with a poli-
tician’s reason for the immediate unifica-
tion of Australia’s railway gauges:
Twenty-five millions yearly is now being
raised for unemployment purposes. Here
is the fund for the reform. A change of
objective is all that is required.
A reconsideration of the whole problem
in the light of modern developments is
much more necessary than the discovery
of a new hole for the reception of
£25,000,000 p.a, of relief money.
For over half a century before the
World War most armies depended for
mobility on railway systems. Moltke
set the fashion in 1859, and France still
follows it. France has a static defence
problem; it must be able to rush
troops to its north-east frontier at
short notice. For this purpose its
many strategic railways are still suit-
able. But even in Europe roads are
coming in and railways are going out.
Bombardments from the air were threat-
ening to immobilise railway transport on
both sides of the western front in 1918 ;
and the aeroplane is an incomparably
more efficient weapon now than it was
17 years ago.
There is no country which has less
reason to risk its national life on an
obsolescent form of transport than Aus-
tralia. Its railway system —there is virtu-
ally only one —meanders across deserts
and rivers from capital to capital, and
at many points it is capable of being
put out of action by a single bomb. The
destruction of the Hawkesbury Bridge,
for example, would deprive Sydney of
most of its northern supplies.
_ Modern cities which have been be-
sieged realise how dependent they are on
transport for the necessaries of life. In
1914 Paris was abandoned by many of
the inhabitants, and in 1918 thousands
more were preparing to evacuate
their city; if it had been invested the
railways would have brought no food
from the country, though ’planes and
cars could have delivered some even in
their relatively undeveloped state. Lon-
don’s general strike would perhaps have
succeeded but for the motor-lorries which
delivered the city’s milk requirements at
a depot in Hyde Park. “England,” said
Lord Curzon, “won the war on waves
of oil” (meaning, chiefly, the oil for
’planes and motor-lorries which Ger-
many lacked); and in a similar sense
England won nine years ago on oil ( i.e.,
motor transport) against the T.U.C.
extremists who had planned to break the
Government by starving London.
In the matter of defence —defence
against attempts to set up “dictatorships
of the proletariat,” as well as defence
against foreign invaders Australia
needs to think more in terms of oil than
of steam; more in terms of motor roads
than of railroads. As Captain Liddell
Hart, the military historian, put it in
London “Daily Telegraph” last month:
The Commonwealth’s chief hope lies in
the organisation of the A.M.F. on a
mechanised basis, assisted by the exten-
sion of the road system.
Mechanisation is coming in all the armies
at a tremendous pace. According to
figures quoted recently by Colonel Gor-
don Macready, of the Imperial Defence
College, the ratio of guns to rifles has
increased nearly sevenfold; where there
were three machine-guns to 1000 rifles in
1914 there are now 132 ; when the war
began there were no trench mortars, now
there is roughly one to every hundred
rifles. One famous cavalry regiment
after another has been mechanised, and
the Tank Corps and Motor Transport
Corps occupy positions which would have
seemed incredible to soldiers in 1915.
If Australia ever finds itself on the
defensive in Australia —whether against
invaders or Fascists or Communists—its
railways will be of little assistance to
country-dwellers, and thev may prove
literal menaces to the cities. Just as an
island nation needs to have command of
the adjacent seas, so a great modern city
needs to have command of the adjacent
lands. Most of our cities and towns can
only achieve this, even under peace con-
ditions, with the help of road transport.
Under war conditions nothing would save
them but networks of trade roads over
which their food supplies could move
under the protection of mechanised
units, and strategic roads over which
troops could be transported safely and
expeditiously to their positions.
NATIONAL EDUCATION.
Members of the Victorian Teachers’
Union are making an admirable attempt
to interest an over-governed people sub-
jected to new and menacing forms of
provincialism in national control of edu-
cation. They raised the question at the
Federal conference of teachers at Bris-
bane, but were defeated on the casting
vote of the chairman, a Queenslander.
Undiscouraged, they brought it up again
at their State conference, held a week
or two later, and secured a majority.
On each occasion the subject was in-
troduced by a lady, Miss Gilbert. She
said, in effect, that all Australian children
should have equal educational opportuni-
ties, but, with schooling expensively ad-
ministered by States (all of which are
financially embarrassed apd three chroni-
cally dependent on Commonwealth
grants), they are not getting them —which
is true. There is always a tendency in
bad times to “take it out of the kids,”
and during the current depression, as in
that of the ’nineties, harsh and short-
sighted economies have been practised
at the expense of scholars and instructors
alike.
“When I came into office,” said
the Tas. Labor Minister for Education,
“I found that teachers were housed like
pigs.” His Nationalist predecessor hotly
denied it, but this gentleman has had to
admit that “there are ’ undoubtedly many
school buildings still in use which do
not come up to present-day standards.”
Each State Education Department has
its own curriculum, its own methods of
vocational training and its own patheti-
cally futile way of trying to find work
for youngsters leaving school or letting
them shift for themselves. There is no
common policy nor any sort of co-opera-
tion. Proposals for raising the leaving
age have been desultorily considered and
dropped on the score of cost. It is diffi-
cult to believe that they would get such
a reception from a Commonwealth Gov-
ernment with an annual surplus ; but, as
things are, the Commonwealth may wash
its hands of responsibility for the great
masses of jobless ex-scholars.
An opponent of Miss Gilbert’s pro-
posal objected that national control
would “need an amendment of the
Federal Constitution, which it would be
most difficult to get.” No Constitutional
amendment is required; Section 51
gives the national Parliament power
to make laws with respect to “matters”
referable to it “by the Parliament or
Parliaments of any State or States”;
and education is one of those matters.
Section 85 specifies what must be
done “when a department of the public
service of a State is transferred to
the Commonwealth” ; and various State
departments have been so transferred. The
same objector was in favor of letting ill
alone because, “under Federations, con-
trol of education is always left to the
provinces.” This may be so, but it is ques-
tionable whether any of the few re-
maining Federations has an educational
system which can be compared with the
national system of France, In any case
provincial control is apt to foster the
provincial spirit. There are Westralians
who say that the secession agitation has
been helped, directly and indirectly, by
discontented teachers with limited hori-
zons. The leaders are old men, but a
great many of their supporters are young
persons, products of the provincial
schools.
Another argument for national control
is related to the revival of the demand
for State aid for church schools. Lang-
Labor has yielded to it; in Archbishop
Mannix’s words, “the Labor party in
N. S. Wales has pledged itself to lighten
the burden on Catholic shoulders if re-
turned to power.” The Archbishop sees
in this “a readiness to do justice” on Mr.
Lang’s part. It is really a vulgar vote-
catching stunt, but in a State with single
electorates and a habit of changing its
Government every two or three years—
and there are other States like that—it
may come off. It would not even be
attempted were education made a Com-
monwealth matter; it could not be
attempted with any chance of getting
control of the Senate.
Premier Argyle is reported to have
said at the Australia Day celebration that
education absorbs all Victorian taxa-
tion. This is not correct, but it is a
fact that the expenditure on State
schools, buildings included, just about
equals the return from ordinary State
income and dividend taxes. Common-
wealth “Year-Book” figures:
Income- Cost of State
tax Receipts. Schools.
N.S.W. £3,411,146 £4,197,831
Victoria 2,061,561 2,189,390
Queensland 1,652,329 1,212,657
South Australia .. 1,484,066 785,405 ‘
Westralia 436,767 528,585
Tasmania 242,347 238,185
£9,288,216 £9,152,053
This suggests that, with a few adjust-
ments (and they might be made by let-
ting the States have the land tax, which
brings in about £2,500,000 a year), the
Commonwealth could take over educa-
tjon and income taxation at the same
time ; and why not? Why should the
taxpayers have to support six political
Ministers of Education, each with a per-
sonal staff? Why should they be cursed
with seven income taxes when one would
suffice?
THE AERIAL BOG.
Kingsford Smith, questioned about his
trans-Pacific flight, declares that he found
it dull; but Lord Sempill, who is cele-
brating his 21st year in aeronautics, will
be able to tell the European air societies
to which he belongs that flying is an
adventurous business in Australia. Years
have elapsed since an aeroplane was
bogged in a landing-ground in Europe,
but the thing has happened half a dozen
times since Lord Sempill arrived in the
Commonwealth. Twice within a fort-
night the overseas airmail has had to
be dug out at Darwin, For this, and for
the failure of somebody to light the
beacon there for an incoming ’plane,
Darwin has the excuse that it is in the
wilds. Great cities have no excuse for
their shortcomings.
Mascot, the aerial headquarters of the
biggest city in Australia, is what Croy-
don might have been in England if it
had been laid out by Boadicea. It is
on the edge of a swamp, with a surface
like the plains of the Barcoo and a strip
or two of runway which might conceiv-
ably meet the needs of an Asian village.
Its surroundings make visibility bad on
its approaches. It is bunkered round its
borders with traps for young aviators
in the shape of wires and buildings, and,
lest it should be invaded by people who
do not own cars, it is situated at the
end of a dreary mile or two from the
tram. It could he put into one corner
of the great Templehof, which serves
Berlin, is a pocket-handkerchief beside
Croydon, and has no control tower or
efficient radio-telephony or navigation
arrangements.
Lord Sempill has uttered a few pleas-
antries about Mascot, but it was only
about Melbourne’s Essendon that he
really did himself justice. He was “hor-
rified,” he said, to find it surrounded by
high-tension wires, telegraph lines and
unlighted wireless masts, and endowed
with a reservoir in the middle of the
landing-ground.
I would much sooner bathe in the reser-
voir than land beside it.
He found Essendon, in common with
other grounds, devoid of broadcast hom-
ing devices, directional wireless and effi-
cient lighting. Of Archerfield (Brisbane),
Parafield (Adelaide) and Cootamundra he
said, in effect, that they were the makings
of modern ’dromes.
Arriving one evening at Brisbane the
flying baron, with a courtly effort to
control his temper (noblesse oblige ), re-
marked that he found our maps “in-
adequate for airmen.” “Inadequate” be-
cause “the country as a whole is feature-
less and the towns are far distant.” He
hoped the Government would have the
maps “re-edited.” No doubt it will —
perhaps after somebody has been killed on
the dangerous Barkly Tablelands stretch.
Ground organisation is also “inadequate,”
because landsmen are uncontrolled.
If I were an official I would declare
many of your machines unairworthy after
youths on the ground have touched them,
until a mechanic has examined them. I
would not get in a ’plane which has been
tampered with by people.
There are irksome regulations, too. It
is more difficult for a British subject to
visit Australia by air than for a German
to land at Croydon. A foreigner could
pass all British formalities in five
minutes. Until Australia frees the air
from its swaddling of red-tape “the de-
velopment of commercial aviation will
be disastrously curtailed.” And “there
can be no Australia as an advanced
active commercial entity without progres-
sive aviation.”
But for one feature of Australian
aviation, the personnel. Lord Sempill had
nothing but praise. He found the com-
mercial fliers of New Guinea “doing
things that able London fliers would
refuse to do” —landing on hilly, uneven
country with ton loads and only a 300 ft.
runway, for instance. He thinks the
N. S. Wales Aero Club, in spite of Syd-
ney’s Dismal Swamp aerodrome, one of
the most energetic organisations of its
kind in the world, and pronounces the
officers of the Civil Aviation Department
“an active body of men grossly over-
worked.” He recommends “expansion
of staff and a far-sighted plan of de-
velopment” ; and beyond all doubt they
are needed. In this connection a job
could be found for Kingsford Smith, in-
stead of letting him risk his neck in
flights that lead to nothing or condemn-
ing him to earn his living by taking
up squealing flappers for joy-rides.
DRIFTING LANDS.
Erosion of the coast is growing to be as
serious a matter in Victoria as it is in
England, where coastlines have receded
more than five miles in a century. To
put it another way, Victoria is becom-
ing more settled, and the erosion which
has been going strong from the beginning
of time is now noticeable and has become
a menace.
Photographs showing the beaches in
bayside suburbs 10 years ago reveal land-
scapes which are not now recognisable
and differences which would not be
credited but for the pictorial proof.
What Victoria is going to do about it is
a problem. Port Phillip Bay could, of
course, be saved in its present form by
the construction of a sea wall round the
100 miles of foreshore ; but, even were the
citizens prepared to bear such an appal-
ling cost, the wall would in itself destroy
that wonderful succession of beaches
which has won the admiration of Gov-
ernor Huntingfield. As it is, the sea has
seriously encroached on the beaches. It
has turned picturesque cliffs into danger-
zones which may fall on the public or
with the public. It has converted swim-
ming-pools into masses of wrecked rock.
But it has done more than interfere
with the pleasures and the health of the
public. It has demolished costly public
works, made roads formerly well inland
precarious strips on the edges of crumbly
precipices. It has overcome private
gardens and brought waves almost to
back doors. Foreshore reserves wisely
held for public use exist to-day only on
the map, and it is impossible to walk
along beaches without trespassing on
private property.
There is the problem. Victoria awaits
some scientist to work out a solution.
So far, the construction of artificial
islands, planted with mangroves to pre-
serve them, seems the best suggestion
offered. But it is only the suggestion of
an idealistic layman; the voice of the
scientist, learned in the ways of winds and
tides and ocean scour, has yet to be heard.
Meanwhile there is another form of
erosion which is even more serious
economically—the erosion of dry agri-
cultural lands by winds, and the erosion
of good surface soil by excessive rainfall.
This is an easier matter to deal with, and
one which is largely due to the errors of
the past—the insane desire to fell trees.
The Mallee was originally covered with
scrub ; the fertile but arid soil of that
vast district was made available by rolling
and clearing the scrub from its surface.
But the experience of Europe and Asia
Minor was ignored. Instead of wind-
breaks being left here and there the coun-
try was cleanshaven, with the result that
to-day fences, even houses, are over-
whelmed by drifting dust, and only sub-
soil remains. In areas less 'dry sudden
storms here and there sweep away the
surface soils into the creeks and cover
fertile areas feet deep in scorise brought
down from the high levels.
They faced that difficulty in Europe
many centuries ago. Any Digger who
fought over the area between Amiens and
Villers-Bret. will remember that every
hundred yards or more the undulating
country showed a step of three or four
feet, constituting a succession of terraces
which were sufficiently level to hold
water and prevent washing away. The
traveller passing between Italy and Sicily
sees this terracing in excelsis ; mountain-
sides which are almost declivities have
been terraced down the sides like steps
of a stairway, each tread carrying its
quota of agriculture and every drop of
the precious rain conserved to nourish it.
Australia must learn not to cut down
a tree until it has proved that such de-
struction will not wreak further destruc-
tion of a permanent nature. It must
work out its method of tree protection
both in dry and moist areas, and, if neces-
sary, it must follow the European idea
of terracing where danger exists. Land
bought for £2O an acre is not worth 20s.
an acre if a sudden thunderstorm washes
off the surface to a depth of 2ft. or if
some thousands of tons of gravel drift
from a mountain torrent on top of it


PLAIN ENGLISH.
After 147 Years.
Sydney celebrated its 147th birthday a
few days ago. The occasion found it
with an admiral in command of the
R.A.N, who is English-born and
-trained. All the R.A.N. captains but
one are on loan from the R.N.; so are
all the seagoing members of the Naval
Board, more than half the commanders
and even some lieut.-commanders. This
after the R.A.N. has been in existence
for 24 years and has taken part in a
war in which many Jervis Bay products
distinguished themselves. After less than
four years the A.1.F., from the G.O.C.
practically to its junior n.c.os., was led
by Australians.
The principal Churches have been train-
ing clergymen for over half a century ;
yet the Anglican Archbishop at Sydney is
still an Englishman, and the Catholic
Archbishop is still an Irishman. N. S.
Wales began by importing most of its
barristers and all its Judges. Now all
the members of the Supreme Court
Bench are former members of the
N. S. Wales Bar, and the idea of send-
ing abroad for a Judge would scandalise
not only lawyers but litigants. Why
should Australia be capable of training
generals but not admirals, Chief Justices
but not archbishops?
Perhaps the strangest anomalies of all
are to be seen at Sydney University,
which has a Scottish Chancellor and a
Scottish Vice-Chancellor. The Vice-
Chancellor took his degrees at Aberdeen,
and was brought to Melbourne as Pro-
fessor of English. Sydney took him
from Melbourne in 1928, and shortly
afterwards gave him leave to go to
Europe for the purpose of getting ex-
perience in broadcasting. He is now a
member of the A.B.C. Sydney University
graduates have become Ministers of the
Crown, High Court and Supreme Court
Judges, generals, presidents of the B.M.A.
and heads of great trading and financial
institutions here and in Britain, but seem-
ingly the belief has taken root that their
Alma Mater is incapable of producing a
Chancellor or a Vice-Chancellor.

Houses for the G.-G.
Having apparently made up its mind
that an Australian is hot fit to be Gov-
ernor-General of Australia, the Govern-
ment at Canberra is timidly pushing out
feelers to ascertain how much the people
will stand.
According to inspired paragraphs
appearing in the daily press, it will be
necessary to provide the next man with a
residence in Sydney and one in Mel-
bourne. If the public takes it sitting
down, plans will probably follow for
Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Hobart,
with a few seaside and mountain holiday
boxes scattered about different States.
The official Government House at Can-
berra will, of course, remain at the dis-
posal of the appointed stranger when-
ever he is forced to live in proximity
to the Parliament.
For five years an Australian Governor-
General has been in office. He has done
his job with competence and dignity. In
his speeches he has struck a high
national note without ever differentiating
between the States or failing in devotion
to the Empire. And not once during his
five years has it been suggested that the
people of Australia should be taxed to
provide him with houses in the States,
*
“Bleed ’Em, Boys!”
Fadden, M.L.A., has dug up some amaz-
ing facts about the incidence of
taxation in Queensland. On the last £lOOO
of a taxable income of £7OOO derived
from property, State and Commonwealth
taxes are £1 os. 4.8 d. in the £ ; on the last
£lOOO of £BOOO, £1 Is. 11.28 d. in the £.
He quotes these figures;
Taxable Federal State
Income. Tax. Taxes (2). Total.
£4OOO £1066 14 2 £965 0 0 £2031 14 2
5000 1501 14 2 1397 10 0 2899 4 2
6000 1936 14 2 1906 10 0 3843 4 2
7000 2371 14 2 2492 0 0 4863 14 2
8000 2806 14 2 3154 0 0 5960 14 2
The net result is that the man on £5OOO is
left with £6l 10s. more (£2lOO 15s. 10d.)
than the man on £BOOO (£2039 ss. 10d.),
and that victim of legalised banditry is
left with only £7l more than a person
with half his nominal income.
This is “calm, settled, imperturbable,
drivelling idiocy.”

Bodyline Finance.
The Victorian Labor conference signi-
fied its approval of Langism, even to the
sacrifice of the N.S.W. remnant that has
remained faithful to the idea of a
national Labor party, democratically con-
trolled, so it naturally came out with a
declaration of hostility to mortgagees. It
did not propose a 10 p.c. capital levy on
private mortgagees (himself excepted) as
Mr. Lang did. It suggests that mortgage
debts be surrendered to “a corporation”
with power to fix “the capital amount of
the debt at an amount having regard to
the value of the security and the original
margin on that value” (whatever that
may mean), interest to be reduced to 2
p.c. It proposes to catch the mortgagee
going and coming, as it were.
When “reformers” of this type think
of mortgages, they think only of the
householder with a cottage in one of
the industrial suburbs. But a large part
of the money borrowed on mortgage is
borrowed by one “capitalist” who wishes
to expand his business from another who
is playing safe. It is practically an axiom
of business life that its finance should
be conducted on an overdraft. Where
solid assets like buildings are concerned,
it is clumsy and sometimes dangerous to
have the money owing on these subject
to the changing interest rates of a bank.
Far better to face the certain payments
under a fixed mortgage.
Leaving out of consideration the harm
that would be done to Government say-
ings banks and rural banks and the addi-
tional taxes that would have to be raised,
the Labor plan would, on the face of it,
help the indigent suburban householder.
But it would give a far greater measure of
assistance to a large army of hated capi-
talists by enabling them to dodge pay-
ments to concerns like the A.M.P., to
which so many thrifty workers have en-
trusted their savings, and which has
£20,000,000 out on mortgage.

St. James’s, Sydney.
The Stevens Government intends, if
returned, to build new law courts at the
top of King-street. The scheme is
scheduled to cost about a quarter of a
million sterling; but, apart from being
a matter of urgency owing to the diffi-
culty of administering justice within a
few feet of a tramline, the new building
should be a - sound investment. It will
house the Justice Department and all the
courts which at present are scattered in-
conveniently about the city.
Best of all, from the by no means
negligible standpoint of aesthetics, Sydney
will be given a chance to do justice to
St. James’s Church. Here is a building
that any city might be proud of; all
it lacks is a setting. The pleasure that
a beautiful church or house gives when
placed in the right surroundings will be
realised by anyone who has repeatedly
passed one of Wren’s city churches;
say St. Clement Dane’s in the Strand.
There St. Clement Dane’s sits in solid
loveliness on its little island site, a
pleasure to the eye from whatever angle
it happens to be viewed.
A feature of every good architectural
job is that, though it may never startle
the spectator, as so many modernistic
experiments do, it never bores him. On
the contrary, the spectator is gratified
afresh each time his gaze rests on the
building, and this applies irrespective of
the culture of the gazer.
The cumulative delight—mild, no
doubt, but very real —which St. James’s
has been bestowing, year in, year out,
for the past century is beyond compu-
tation. It might be greatly added to, for
the benefit of posterity as well as that
of present-day Sydneyites, by dedicating
the space left by the removal of the law
courts as a park. The city would thus
kill several birds with one stone—acquire
another lung ; do justice to an interest-
ing historical monument; above all, pro-
vide what many regard as the State’s
chief architectural gem with a worthy
frame.
•
Yes, We Have Some Mananas.
“Almost persuadest thou me to be a
Fascist,” the Melbourne citizen must
murmur when he passes for the ump-
teenth time wreckage wrought by the
storm of many weeks ago—still in the
position it occupied the day after the
winds and floods died down.
For six weeks the Metropolitan Board
of Works and the Prahran Council each
denied liability to repair a road beside
the Yarra along which go tens of thou-
sands of vehicles a day. While citizens
growled, these bodies passed the buck to
each other every other day. At last,
when the growling grew into a thunder,
the Government woke up, decided that it
was the council’s job, and ordered it to
get busy. A week afterwards the road
was still blocked, and drivers had to
cover a couple of extra miles to reach
the city.
Along the main road to the Dande-
nong hills a bridge was washed away.
It is still washed away, and apparently
is going to keep on being washed away.
The Department of Public Utilities, or
some other body, says the responsibility
for repairs rests with the Department of
Public Inutilities. The latter denies the
charge ; and the business of repudiating
responsibility goes on. Meanwhile, all
the traffic to the mountain resorts has to
make a detour of several miles. There
are many other instances of the sort in
the vicinity of Melbourne, and the argu-
ments of the contending bodies sound
like a wilderness of loudspeakers gone
mad.
In every one of these cases, everybody
knows that the repairs will have to be
effected sooner or later. Some_ day the
alternations of charge and evasion must
come to an end, and, wherever the money
is to come from, the services will be
restored. Knowing this the State Gov-
ernment, at the first exhibition of re-
sponsibility-dodging, should take the
matter in hand itself, carry out the work
and send the bill to the body afterwards
adjudged responsible.

The New Despots.
The Political Summer School, which
annually gives the millennium a short air-
ing at some fashionable resort, met this
year at Healesville (Vic.). Professor
after professor looked into the glass of
reform and saw the power of Parliament
waning. Mr. Bland, from Sydney, painted
for his earnest audience “Cabinet Minis-
ters under intolerable physical and mental
strain,” Government “more and more
tending to become administration with-
out control by the people” and Parlia-
ment without sufficient time to discuss
and implement its policies,
Mr. Bland wants Parliamentary terms
extended to five years. More reasonable
is his proposal for standing committees
to consider legislation before it is intro-
duced—a system which works well in the
London County Council, which is twice
the size of the House of Representatives;
less reasonable, the establishment of a
“special external committee, preferably
of University members and trained ex-
perts, for the prior discussion of legisla-
tive proposals.”
Already Governments have a pas-
sion for referring every problem they
can’t solve offhand, from the technical
management of meatworks to the
troubles of picture-showmen, to accoun-
tant-economists whose reports never
come to anything.
Professor Charteris, an older head, was
more lucid, and most people will agree
with his indictment against Transport
Commissions and the like, which,
through their power to make reams of
regulations, ignore public opinion and
establish despotisms. And there was
knowledge in his remark that “Cabinet
Ministers sometimes become too old to
be even willing to depart from estab-
lished routine.”
Mr. Bland’s crowning method of pre-
venting the dictatorial exercise of poli-
tical patronage and taming the “arrogance
of bureaucracies” is the establishment of
a Supreme Administrative Council. This
body would consist of lawyers and
scientists, financiers and businessmen, and
its functions would be
On application by political executives
to abolish, dismember or reorganise such
agencies as tariff boards, transport commis-
sions or water and electricity trusts. It
should have jurisdiction over that field
which is popularly described as the new
despotism, and would curb excesses of
departmental regulation-making power.
Russia has such a body already. So
has Italy. In each country it is the
machinery through which dictators work.
Under any system it would be bound to
supersede Parliament and destroy repre-
sentative government. Australians do not
need it. In the last resort they can deal
with despotism as they dealt with Mr.
Lang’s.
*
Economists Hold Forth.
A layman among the professors:
Every master of economic doctrine, from
Adam Smith to Keynes, was represented by a
disciple when the economists forgathered at
the Science Congress in I listened
to all, and left confused and disappointed.
One professor argued that stability of prices
in a progressive economy must produce in-
flation. Another wondered that anyone could
think that inflation would follow if prices were
stabilised. A third contended that credit should
be expanded, even if prices rose and the ex-
change was further depreciated.
Professor Giblin tilted a lance against
capitalism.
“The Australian experience offers but
one of many examples that could be
adduced of the failure of the automatic
economic adjustment on which our eco-
nomy is nominally based.”
Professor Melville suggested that our ills were
due to the failure of monopolies and Govern-
ments to permit prices freely to fluctuate with
economic needs.
Professor Fisher reminded Professor Cop-
land that he had written in 1930: “A condition
of recovery is the maintenance of the present
volume of export production, and its extension
if possible.” One orator affirmed that depres-
sions were becoming more severe; another that
investigators would have to go back to the
Napoleonic wars for a similar set of facts as a
basis for a parallel. Some speakers assumed
that another depression was inevitable; others
hoped that it might be avoided; to another
authority a compromise between competition
and control was not beyond the bounds of
possibility.
A learned gentleman from Westralia sug-
gested that air transport should be developed.
“Free, compulsory and secular flying!” inter-
posed a Tasmanian scornfully.
On questions of statistical investigations, the
economists excel; around matters of theory and
practice, they have built vested interests in
ideas that they refuse to modify. The eco-
nomist is never wrong, because circumstances
are always changing, and he can blame the cir-
cumstances if his prophecies are not fulfilled.
*
Our Wave-lengths.
Medical methods of argument lag
behind medical science. Witness the dis-
cussion between the president of the
N. S. Wales B.M.A. and the Minister for
Health. One of the combatants refers to
a proportion of doctors as “duds” ; the
other utters the awful heresy that Minis-
ters of the Crown are “sometimes recre-
ant to their trust.”
There are men alive who still remem-
ber when leeches, bleeding and rhubarb
and magnesia had not gone out of
fashion. A daughter of the first medico
to use chloroform in N. S. Wales
survives in an age when the electric
knife closes veins as it cuts, when deep-
ray therapy and radium cure cancers
which a dozen years ago meant death,
when diabetes and pernicious amemia
have almost lost their terrors. Tubercu-
losis has been brought under control.
Scarlet fever and typhoid, dreaded
scourges which carried off thousands
every year, are conquered. Moving-
pictures are made of human insides, and
patients may watch their livers being
carved by a surgeon with no more dis-
comfort than assails them as they watch
the head waiter taking a slice off the
joint. The average human stature has
increased, and the expectation of life
has improved 14 p.c. in a generation.
The omega of modern research, how-
ever, is the latest move to reduce
humanity to its electrical constituents.
Early experimenters with wireless found
that operating a short-wave wireless set
produced a condition akin to fever.
Radio science has now supplemented this
with the discovery—the staple of this
year’s clinical discussions in London —
that everybody has his wave-length, and
that the same is true of every part of his
body and every disease he contracts.
Hence it should soon be possible to
tune-in to the patient, find out what is
the matter with him and treat him by
emanation.
When this technique is perfected a
great deal of argument will be stopped.
The president of the B.M.A. will no
longer write to Granny “Herald” about
Mr. Weaver. He will merely tune-in to
him and, discovering an irritable condi-
tion of the liver, send out pacifying
waves on the appropriate broadcasting
set. And Mr. Weaver, instead of devas-
tating the wave-lengths of his larynx by
shouting that medicoes are “duds” and
that they must each have a year’s hospi-
tal experience, will insist on submitting
them and their intelligences to the proper
balancing radio treatment.
There will, in fact, be hope for every-
body. Even Mr. Lang may be tamed.

Censorships.
“Whitehall”: An adequate number of
leagues on the lines of the one that has
been organised by the Catholics of Vic-
toria should make our censorships, Fed-
eral and State, more palpably superflu-
ous than they are already. The Vic-
torian innovation, though clerically in-
spired, is not administered by clerics.
Those who advise the faithful about films
are laymen ; and young ones at that.
The disadvantages of ecclesiastical cen-
sors, who are always elderly and often
unworldly, is that they take exception to
the wrong things; they are liable to be
shocked by a leg show which is merely
boresome to modern youngsters, and
edified by the story of the handsome
thug who repents when he has committed
four or five murders, marries the mil-
lionaire’s daughter and lives happily
ever after.
State censors work by rule of thumb
—certain areas of the human frame,
measured in inches, to be covered ; cer-
tain expletives not to be used. That
makes their activities absurd.
The advantage of an arrangement
under which lay nominees of a church
(guaranteed by the church to be intelli-
gent and honest) pronounce judgment on
films for the benefit of their co-religion-
ists is that no compulsion is involved.
The faithful are offered protection;
whether or not they avail themselves of
it is their affair. Those who don’t go
to church are protected already, to an
extent, by the laws against blasphemy
and obscenity.
The system might be extended to litera-
ture. And then for the abolition of all
public censors!

"AND ITS PRINTED WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Second Murderer”; In an English
illustrated paper I encountered a picture
of a barman behind his bar at Eupen.
He is in Germany, but the customer
across the bar is in Belgium. Even in
Sydney there are some similar anomalies.
The Albury Hotel in Oxford-street is an
example. A diagonal line, marking the
City of Sydney boundary, runs through
the hotel, part of which is in Sydney
and the remainder in Paddington. This
imaginary line runs on through the cot-
tages facing Barcom-avenue, so that the
man who rents a room in one of them
may cook his morning chop in the
kitchen and be a bona fide lodger with
a vote for the City Council. But when
he retires to his front bedroom to devour
it he becomes an elector of Paddington.

“G. Trotter”: Seeing that almost the
whole of the Commonwealth passes
through a hot summer, and most of
it through a very hot
one —even Melbourne
has its days topping
the century —why is it
that, from Albany to
Darwin, the Australian
persists in wearing a
felt hat manufactured
for winter wear? In
every European coun-
try that I know of, in-
cluding England, the
summer, however brief,
brings out all the men
in straw hats. They
were popular enough
in Australia, too, until
the war years sent up
the price so high that
nobody could afford
them. Then the manu-
facturers turned to
something else, and to-
day they apparently
daren’t risk a return to
straws. Yet even the
gazettes of modern Moscow —where
Napoleon’s army nearly froze to death
—show straw hats to be the most favored
headgear for a good portion of the year.

“Bondi-ite”; Brighton (Vic.) had its
baths destroyed during the recent storm,
and is agitating for funds to rebuild
them. Since mixed bathing came into
vogue, however, there is little demand
for enclosed baths, except for sporting
contests; all the public wants are beach
dressing-sheds and protection against
sharks. The old-time enclosed baths
went out of date when the present cen-
tury was young.

“S.T.S.”: The language plays tricks
with us at times. At a funeral I attended
lately there was an old gravestone hard
by with the simple inscription “To two
little Marys.” How should the bereaved
parents imagine that Barrie would happen
a little later, and make the term for ever
comic?
* * * *
“G.M.”: A Melbourne street accident
involving the death of a blind man has
led once more to the advocacy of blind
people using white sticks as a warning
to others. Coroner Grant strongly sup-
ported the idea, but was told that most
blind people themselves object to their
affliction being advertised. There is much
truth in this. Years ago I lived at
Gordon (N.S.W.), and each morning when
I ran for the Sydney train I was raced
to the platform by a blind professional
man who would strongly resent any pas-
senger’s endeavors to ensure his safety.
He was proud of his ability to sprint
over rough roads, dash down the ramp
and jump on the train as well as any of
us. Once I saw him cross a Sydney
thoroughfare with a skill that was al-
most uncanny. He strode across, not at
right-angles but diagonally, stepped down
confidently at the first kerb and raised
his foot at the right time when he
reached that on the other side. How he
did it I’ve never been able to discover —-
but he did.

“Western”: The evolution of lan-
guage! In the early Kalgoorlie days
the miner going on shift went to the time-
keeper’s office for his candles, and was
either given or refused the same. At
that time “pitching a plod” meant pitch-
ing a tale —usually to the shift boss as
an excuse for some misdemeanor.
Gradually the shift boss became the plod-
pitcher, the said plod taking the form of
directions as to where ,to work. Now
the nimble-penned reporter, writing up
the Golden Mile strike, informs the world
that the men on shift were refused their
“plods,” i.e., refused candles and working
directions.
“Kerys”: Clubber, having had his few
remaining teeth yanked out, ordered a
full set. He wore them a day, and then,
finding them a trifle irksome, wrapped
them carefully in his handkerchief and
started for the 5.15. Panting along
the platform he drew forth his hand-
kerchief to mop his perspiring brow;
the teeth fell out without his noticing
them in the hurly-burly. Next day
the dentist received a commission
“Nice lass you are! Didn’t you see me yelling for help?”
“Course I did. Didn’t you see me laughing?”
for a duplicate of the previous order.
He suggested that the loss first be adver-
tised, said he ’ d soo " er P a *

“Mundus”; The world is progressing
in one respect; no blunders of the past
are perpetuated in modern buildings. A
generation or two back, Australia’s only
idea was to copy slavishly Old-World
structures designed in a time when archi-
tecture confined itself to presenting
beautiful facades and paid no attention
whatever to comfort or convenience.
Most of the public buildings in Austra-
lian capitals are modest travesties of
Whitehall. Many of the Great Public
Schools appeared as replicas of monastic
erections of the Middle Ages—cold, dark
and utterly unsuitable for the use of
growing boys. Parliament Houses are
all modelled on St. James, which itself
badly needs bringing up to date. Now
Melbourne Public Library has dis-
covered that it can house only a fraction
of the books it possesses, for the simple
reason that when the reading-room was
built that of the British Museum was
taken as a model.

“Biltong”: Mention (B. 30/1/’35) of
the Johannesburg Zarps—Zuid African
Republic Police —reminds me of the
bitter remark of one of the Jameson
Raiders of 1895, after Cronje had laid
them by the heels. “Those Johannes-
burg ‘Reformers,’ ” he complained,
“might have done something practical
to show they needed the assistance we
risked our lives to give. All they did
was to meet and pass resolutions. They
never even killed a Zarp!” Still, con-
sidering that the leading Reformers had
to pay £25,000 apiece to Oom Paul’s Gov-
ernment, perhaps it was as well for them
that they never carried their treasonable
activities to the point of killing a Zarp.
* * * *
“Nahma”: The prospects of tunny-
fishing being added to the Common-
wealth’s attractions are brightened by
a recent happening at Albany (W.A.).
A school of the huge fish having
been reported inside the harbor, a
veteran fisherman and his son stole
on them in the early morning with
a seine net and trapped the lot.
They had bitten off more than they could
chew, for their captives leaped and
lunged frantically till they had smashed
an opening in the three-inch mesh,
through which a dozen or so escaped.
But two were left, and, the water being
shallow, the fishermen jumped in and
after a desperate struggle managed to
dispatch the still-entangled laggards with
sheath-knives. One fish weighed 2301 b.,
cleaned ; the other 1981 b. It is not stated
what they fetched ; the flesh of Thunnus
thynnus, according to the authorities, is
coarse, oily and scarcely edible except at
a pinch.

“Demonax”: “Chymist” shows little
knowledge of his subject when he asserts
that “carbon dioxide passes through rub-
ber as through a sieve” (B. 23 /1 / ’35).
All compounds of rubber do not absorb
CO2, and most of those that do absorb
it very slowly. Some years ago com-
pressed CO2 was put on the market in
small cylinders for inflating the tyres of
motor-cars. I have driven many thou-
sands of miles on tyres thus inflated, and
the leakage was no more than if air had
been used. Moreover, there are com-
pounds of rubber that are quite insoluble
in petrol and all the usual solvents of
rubber —ether, benzine, carbon tetra-
chloride. Admittedly, there are chemical
substances that attack and disintegrate
rubber —concentrated nitric acid is one
—but I would like to know what
are the “deadly gases” against which
suitable rubber-impregnated clothing
would not afford protection. Certainly,
chloropicrin, chlorine, phosgene, BB di-
chlorethyl sulphide (mustard gas), to
name a few common ones, are not
among such.
“A.W.”: “J.D.” (B. 16/1 /’35) com-
ments on the “A’s” getting off lightly in
the casualties of the 39th Battalion,
A.I.F. For amazing good fortune the
record of No. 13 platoon, D company,
22nd Battalion, would take some beating.
Although nearly 900 members ,of the
battalion were killed in action No. 13
platoon went until close to the Armistice
before losing a man, and it came
through with only two killed in action.
No. 16 platoon in the same battalion
always suffered severely ; a steady suc-
cession of officers was outed almost as
soon as they had taken charge.

“Jobber”: Mention of old-time
methods of transporting cash and gold
(B. 23 /1 / ’35) awakens some memories.
When I was a bank teller on a Victorian
goldfield about 30 years ago, we did a
roaring business in gold-buying. The
rough stuff was smelted on our own
premises, and once a month the boss and
I took the issue into Bendigo, whence it
was sent to Melbourne. As a general
rule, the monthly load ran from 9000
to 12,000 ounces. It was conveyed in
an old four-wheeled cab, drawn by a
very old horse, and driven by a very old
man. The springs of the cab seemed to be
held together by wire ; the shafts were in
the same unhappy condition. Nothing
ever happened to the escort (!) while I
was on the job, but I remember suggesting
to the boss that we should at least have
the protection of the local police trooper.
That, however, would have cost the
branch five bob, and the boss turned my
idea down. When the next lot was ready
and my services were requisitioned I
turned the job down.
“Salamaua” (New Guinea): Casual
methods of transporting gold? A native
walked into our office and proffered a
dirty, ragged piece of brown paper on
which was written: “Please send Taliu
back to Aitape and put the gold in my
account, Bill.” When asked for the gold,
the native unslung his rucksack and
dumped on the counter a sock containing
82 ounces. It seemed that Bill (mining
in the back-country), instead of waiting
to take his gold on one of his infre-
quent trips to the aerodrome, had
sent it by the boy, whose period of in-
denture was up, and who had to be re-
turned to the village he had been re-
cruited from. The native took 13 days
on the journey, which was through
rugged, mountainous country, inhabited
by tribes with no love for strangers. As
an instance of sublime faith in the
honesty of a paid-off native and of his
capacity to look after his skin, this <s
unique in N.G. annals.

• “Como”: I remember the old Sobraon
—now to be sold —when she was a
steamer, berthed at Port Melbourne pier
and taking exclusive passengers to Lon-
don. Outliving her usefulness in steam —
never very high—she was converted into
a sailer, and for years traded between
Europe and Australia under wind power.
Then came the day when the N.S.W.
Government purchased her as a training
ship ; later the Commonwealth took her
over, and rechristened her the Tingara.
She was then sold to a private owner,
and now comes the last stage of all —un-
less some enterprising businessman can
evolve some means of turning her to
profit for a few more years before the
inevitable breaking-up.

“D.J.” discourses on Art:
A Sydney essayist regarding the aesthetics of
rich Australians.
“The fat, overfed ladies who decorate
their walls with smudgy prints of ‘Bubbles’
and ‘Dignity and Impudence.’ ”
Worms and moths respectively have con-
sumed these ladies and their pictures. The
Philistines of to-day cover their walls with
locally-produced imitations of Gauguin, Matisse
and the rest. After a few weeks’ practice as
a modernist anybody can turn out daubs of
men and women with vast shapeless boots, legs
and arms like sausages and scorbutic faces,
who lean stiffly against crimson tree-trunks or
display their obscene disproportions in gamboge
streams; and they have a ready sale amongst
those who like to be in movements.
Gone with the Landseer and Millais repro-
ductions are the divans, cushions and curtains
of the nineteenth century. The 1935 Philis-
tine’s furniture is of steel, as stiff and cold to
the touch as a corpse; his home is as bare
as a morgue. Suburban villas as now worn
are not like undersized English country houses;
they resemble sawn-off Gothic cathedrals with
the spires knocked down and facings and
irrelevant pillars of steel or synthetic stone or
some dark, glassy substance tacked on. Pubs,
cinemas, etc., are also beginning to get them-
selves up in this style.
The paintings of Lord Leighton and his col-
leagues ; the buildings of the nineteenth-cen-
tury architects who designed Belgrave-square
and Cadogan-place in London, Burdekin House
and the Union Club in Sydney; the interior
decorations of the poet Morris; the novelist De
Morgan seem comic to those who admire the
latest in art nouveau, but they’re only funny
because they happen to be unfashionable.
Picture Shakspeare’s reaction to a Princess
Marina hat.
A SCHOLAR’S TRIBUTE.
“Mr. Bloomfield, a former headmaster of Win-
chester College, now visiting Australia, says that the
speech of waterside workers and coal-trimmers is
more fluent and descriptive than anything else in
the world.”
He comes across the seas, a leisured roamer,
Proficient in full many a classic tongue;
He knows the surging syllables of Homer,
The smoothly rippling odes old Horace sung.
But he never guessed how much expressive
matter
From human lips could casually roll
Till he hearkened to the crisp and vivid patter
Of the chaps who load the liners up with
coal.
His head is stacked with poetry, from Dante’s
And Francis Villon’s down to Ezra Pound’s;
He’s probably familiar with Cervantes
And, like as not, can tell how Gaelic sounds.
But there’s nothing so pictorially graphic,
He finds, so full of pungency and soul,
As the terse remarks amid the wharfside
traffic
Of the chaps who load the liners up with
coal.
He'll never hear what goes with bullock-
goading,
Or did in days agone—he comes too late.
He may not list to demagogues exploding
In hectic Parliamentary debate.
But for easy fluency and zip and mettle,
For stuff that hits the spot and finds the goal,
He hands the palm or (say) awards the kettle
To the chaps who load the liners up with
coal.

“Secocoeni”: A story comes from Jo’-
burg of how some mine natives, prepar-
ing for a spree, were mixing a decoction
of which the basis was dop in a tin
over a fire. One of the ingredients was
dynamite, much fancied by the artless
savage as a cocktail addition. This time
the kick came unexpectedly, the mixture
exploding and injuring most of the ex-
pectant revellers. The idea is not con-
fined to Kaffirs. During the South Afri-
can War hardened topers used to add a
few sticks of rifle cordite to their liber-
ally watered rum to give it backbone.
There were also the “cordite kings,”
some of whom every regiment harbored.
Whenever one of these heard rumors of
a particularly nasty stunt ahead, he swal-
lowed some cordite from a cartridge and
took the resulting temperature to the
quack. The trick was well known, but
the Bloemfontein typhoid epidemic had
“Somethink gone an’ bust on yer, miss us?”
“No, not exactlay. Merelay a slaight irregularity of the functioning mechanism."
resulted in orders that sudden tempera-
ture meant hospital at once, and so the
leadswinger got away with it.

“Oxmead”: According to Kerensky,
the ill-fated Czar and his family might
still be alive if it hadn’t been for poli-
tical considerations —not in Russia, but
in England. In “The Murder of the
Romanoffs” Kerensky relates that the
deposed monarch was offered an asylum
by the British Government (Lloyd
George’s), and was on the point of avail-
ing himself of it when word came,
through the British Ambassador, that the
offer had been withdrawn because a
number of Commoners, Laborites and
Liberals, disliked the idea. Followed the
most revolting and cold-blooded mass-
acre of a royal dynasty of which there is
any record in history. Lloyd George has
already furnished so much “inside infor-
mation” about other war-time happen-
ings that it will be interesting to see if
he has any version of his own to give on
this pathetic subject.
* * * *
“Quero”: An ingenious method of
sinking her identity was adopted recently
by a young woman whose where-
abouts the police were interested
in. An up-country station-owner
advertised in a city paper tor
domestic help, adding “child not
objected to.” This brought forth
an attractive young person who
wanted a place where she could
have her two-year-old with her,
and a few days later she was in-
stalled at the station. She stayed
a year, proving an excellent maid,
and though the police in the town-
ship made a few inquiries about
her at one stage they remarked
they were not looking for anyone
with child attached. In the end
she stole away suddenly and
silently, taking a good many valu-
ables, but leaving the child behind. Her
record, when it did leak out, was an
extremely variegated one.
* * * *
“Dryfesdale”: Permit me to correct
“Scribe” (B. 2/1/’35) when he credits the
Edina with being the oldest vessel in com-
mission. The Edina has to dip her colors
to the Clansman, of the David Mac-
brayne line, plying between Glasgow and
the Isle of Skye. The Clansman is the
senior by two years.
“First Walking Gentleman”: A bill
has been introduced in the N.S.W.
Assembly to check the fraudulent goings-
on of managers who take theatrical com-
panies on tour. There was a time, before
the flicks had beaten the touring dramatic
companies to death, when such a measure
was badly needed. Those fly-by-night
dramatic shows were the curse of the
dinkum companies. I have been with
one notorious boarding-house pirate who
scaled everybody, and even paid the pubs
with valueless cheques. Dan Barry once
told me that he demurred at the extor-
tionate rate charged for his advertise-
ments in the “Yow Yow Gazette,” and
the apologetic proprietor explained that
so many visiting theatrical managers
forgot to pay at all that he had to recoup
his losses from the honest ones. Travel-
ling with the Alfred Dampier company,
a most reputable concern, I have been
refused admittance to scores of pubs
unless I paid in advance. On remonstrat-
ing, Bung would always explain that the
Buskem-Howler company had been there
last week, and he wasn’t taking any more
chances. But what’s the use of legislation
at this time of the day, when there are
practically no touring companies and
Poverty Point is only a memory?

“Roki-roki”; The increased value of
gold has stimulated prospecting and min-
ing in the Northern Territory, as else-
where. In the old days the industry was
largely left to Chinamen, who simply
looked for surface shows and never tried
“ Stuck-up pup —forgets his father
an’ me came from the same
dogs’ ’ome.”
to develop them. This was one cause
of the Territory getting the unenviable
name of possessing only mines that did
not live. One only has to wander round
such a place as Brocks Creek (104 miles
from Darwin) to see hundreds of pot-
holes sunk by Chinamen and never per-
severed with. Some of these are now
yielding payable gold to white miners.
John Chinaman may be good at some
things, but at goldmining he is a dud.
* * * *
“Grasspan”: Why is it that military ex-
perts always have to rely on civilians to
leach them their job? Soldiers have been
carrying packs for centuries, and yet it
has been left to Professor Osborne and
A. H. Paul, of Melbourne, to
discover that a swagman can
carry as big a weight as an in-
fantryman with less exertion.
The swagman by experience has
learned how to distribute the
weight over his centre of gravity
while the soldier hasn’t, his job
being not to reason why when
his officers give orders. It is
not so many years since British
soldiers were compelled to
march with stiff arms, “little finger on
the seam of the trousers” ; and even to-
day it is possible to hear recruits ordered
to place the ball of the foot on the
ground before the heel.
“Wagga”: The recent discussion on
the introduction of epidemics amongst
native populations recalls that smallpox
visited the Botany Bay settlement. In 1790
Phillip wrote to Lord Sydney: “Whether
the smallpox which has proved fatal to
great numbers of the natives is a dis-
order to which they were subject before
any Europeans visited this country, or
whether it was brought by the French
ships, we have not yet attained sufficient
knowledge of the language to determine.
It never appeared on board any of the
ships in our passage, nor in the settle-
ment until some time after numbers of
the native had been seen dead.” Appar-
ently Phillip felt quite sure that his men
were not responsible; I don’t know
whether the question was ever cleared up.

“Trews”: One feels diffident about
butting into an argument between
Scotia’s sons about the precise date when
the Black Watch came into being (B.
30/1/’35), but all the authorities within
my reach suggest that “Claymore” was
no more inaccurate in stating that the
force was raised after Culloden (1746)
than “Clan C.” in his assurance that it
began its existence in 1725. The real
fact is that loyal clans (Campbells,
Monroes and others) began to em-
ploy armed companies to police the
Highlands in 1725. There were at least
six or eight Black Watches in those days,
so-called from their dark tartans. It
wasn’t until 1739 that the Black Watch
—“The Royal Highland Black Watch,”
to give it its full title —was enrolled, and
doubtless several clans contributed to its
formation. Later it was to become the
42nd Highlanders ; under either name it
has helped to make history on many
battlefields.

“O. I. Saye” : I wonder where “Pasara”
(B. 23 /1 / ’35) got hold of the idea that
Wilfred White, who left Williamstown
(Vic.) 35 years ago, was the original
White of Kelvin and White, and that K.
and W. is a U.S.A. firm. The company
is Kelvin and James White, Ltd., and
its works are in Cambridge-street, Glas-
gow. In the ’eighties I passed the shop
of James White, optician, Sauchiehall-
street, Glasgow, almost daily: it was
well known that Lord Kelvm (then Sir
William Thomson) entrusted to White
the making of experimental models of in-
struments which he invented. When the
time came to put those inventions on
the market James White formed a
partnership, and moved round the corner
into Cambridge-street. “Pasara” need
not take my word for it; he will find it
all in Russell’s “Lord Kelvin.”

“Pulex”: A plague of fleas has visited
my Sydney suburb and made nonsense
of the theory that owing to the decline of
wool-wearing the flea is becoming ex-
tinct. Furthermore, it has shown thou-
sands of earnest flea-hunters that so
far from wool being the friend of the
flea it is his downfall. Your flea
loves a woollen fabric, particularly
a loosely-woven one, because if his
host institutes an investigation it is
so easy to wriggle through from one
side of the fabric to the other and
establish a perfect alibi. But in places
where fleas are really populous the
searcher is one move ahead on that
gambit, and as a flea on a woollen gar-
ment is as badly hampered as a cat in a
gooseberry-bush his end is sure.

“Lde F.”; After having browsed
among country-town libraries for many
years I can endorse the Pitt-Munn find-
ing that they are not libraries, but
cemeteries of dead books. One can
generally find there complete editions of
Shakspeare, Scott and even Dickens, but
the scarcity of modern books is deplor-
able. At one well-to-do town’s public
library I consulted the dictionary. It
was 60 years old, and the encyclopaedia
was of the same vintage. Other refer-
ence works were on a par. It may be
said in defence that the depression has
affected the libraries. But many country
libraries seem to have never been re-
stocked since the depression of the
’nineties.
THE PATRIOTIC CROOK.
“M. Millet, grandson of the famous painter, who is
being prosecuted in France for selling worthless
pictures, denied that he had ever defrauded a fellow-
countryman. ‘The English know* nothing about art,’
he added; ‘you can sell anything to the English and
Americans.’ ”
His forte, it seems, was specious imitation
Of certain memorable works of art;
Unblushingly he made it his vocation
Chumps from their wads by roguery to part,
And yet, for all his wicked simulation,
Within his breast there beat a patriot’s heart.
He scorned to sell a stumer or a dud
To any man of Gallic breed or blood.
He kept for foreigners his hanky-panky;
For British proliteers he cast his net.
In many a country-house and mansion swanky
His bogus “Masters” on the walls are set.
And just how hard he hit the trustful Yankee
Has possibly not been unfolded yet.
But one may take it that he soaked him good,
As any rascal of his kidney would.
1 see no word of mention that he ever
Essayed to foist his pictures on the Boche.
He may have reckoned Hans a bit too clever
Not to detect his fakes in oil and wash;
Or what, maybe, discouraged the endeavor
Was Fritz’s lamentable lack of splosh.
He found the Anglo-Saxon anyway
A fatter quarry and an easier prey.
What do we ken of Art? Howe’er it harrows,
I’ll say our experts can’t be worth a damn.
He sold his junk like saveloys from barrows,
Suckers by scores fell for his fake and flam.
What should they know of Corots and Pissarros,
Staid Father Bull and honest Uncle Sam?
But while he impudently did them brown,
Note that he never took a Froggie down!
A crook and forger by his own admission,
What shameless frauds to his account there
are!
And yet he claims, ’mid all his imposition,
That love of country was his guiding star.
Meet, then, a twentieth-century edition
Of patriotic Henry of Navarre:
“Down, down with every foreigner”—you know
The Ivry tag—“but let your brethren go.”

POLITICAL POINTS
Loud laments from Norfolk Island are
reaching the mainland. It is an Austra-
lian dependency, but Maoriland wouldn’t
mind possessing it, and has the stronger
geographical claim. But in the stiff-
necked mood which their absurd trade
quarrel has produced, neither will admit
Norfolk Island bananas, and the islanders
are facing ruin. Pearce is going to see
what he can do for them. Ten to one
he will recommend a Royal Commission.
Farmer John Allan is to have three
Cocky opponents for Rodney (Vic.) next
month. The old Minister of Agriculture
doesn’t mind; he believes in “the open
go,” and, as he says, “they have a per-
fect right to come out against me.” John
is no statesman, but many a pre-selec-
tionist could be better spared.
Stevens and Argyle are fortunate in
their enemies. With each preparing for
a general election, nothing could turn
out better for both than the Vic. Labor
Premier Argyle: “The more he drinks
of that the better it'll suit me.”
conference resolution in favor of Lang.
Argyle will derive the immediate benefit,
but Stevens will get his share when the
time comes.
The Government at Canberra is distri-
buting tax-money among the States as if
the Commonwealth’s purse had no bot-
tom. In one day last week it undertook
to find £125,000 for a Queensland dam
and £1,170,000 for the Port Augusta-Red
Hill (S.A.) railway. There is nothing
so sure as that ’planes will be increas-
ingly used for mails and passenger traffic
from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific ;
but Lyons declares that Port Augusta-
Red Hill will show a profit of nearly
£6OOO a year. Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta
loses about £150,000 a year. By heroic
efforts the annual loss on S. Aus. lines
has been reduced from £1,796,200 (in
1929-30) to £840,700.
When is the Sydney Government going
to stop charging taxpayers for the enter-
tainment of a small section of trippers at
Kosciusko? In six years the Govern-
ment hotel there has swallowed up
£43,260 of tax-revenue. Last year’s loss
was £6989 ; it was nearly £lOOO more
than the amount spent on provisions
(£4750) and on stock for the bar (£1244).
Without doubt the joint could be leased
to advantage, but if the consideration
were a peppercorn a year the State
accounts would look less appalling.
Labor feuds last, but the other side
soon drops them. Only 12 months or so
ago Thorby was a persistent critic of the
Lyons Administration. For this the
U.A.P. opposed him at the September
election ; it was said that the Prime Minis-
ter was personally responsible for put-
ting up Dr. Nott. Now Thorby is one of
his Ministers, and he is taking the gentle-
man to London. The C.P. wanted a man
on the delegation, and “Cabinet left the
choice of a Minister to Mr. Lyons, who
selected Mr. Thorby.”
Westralian Minister Kenneally has
gone on his travels again. Appointed to
the Cabinet as “a full-time Minister for
Employment,” he is to be found everv
three or four months in the effete East,
trying to settle the full-time row be-
tween the Langsters and the Scullin-
aries. Some Opposition member really
ought to ascertain how many months the
full-time Minister has been absent from
the State attending these “unity confer-
ences,” as they are jocularly called, and
the information could scarcely be re-
fused. But such questions are never
asked. Ministerial jaunting being a non-
party matter.
Westralia has eight salaried Ministers,
though it is doubtful whether there is
work enough for six. There are seven
in the Assembly, representing (’33 elec-
tion figures) 237,195 persons. South Aus.
gets along with four Assembly Ministers,
representing 338,576 persons.
Sydney’s Milk Board, which has made
milk a luxury, like the board itself, has
taken to distributing bonus payments. Not,
of course, to the consumers who have
to pay 7d. a quart for country milk and
Bd. for milk from the suburbs, but to
parties who profit under the system which
has achieved these prices. For the year
to June 30 bonus payments amounted
to £12,445. The Auditor-General has
held up his annual review owing to “the
necessity of obtaining legal advice as to
the power of the board to make these
payments.”
Cabled that Russia is buying “greasy”
at' London and combed wool at Bradford,
and has arranged to pay cash for up-
wards of a million pounds’ worth of
British machinery, largely railway wheels
and axles. The Reds were desperately
short of cash till they removed certain
doctrinaire barriers to gold production,
which is now reported to have increased
50 p.c. last year to the equivalent of
£16,000,000 sterling. Australia could do
as much or more, but the attitude of its
Governments to gold production has not
altered in 40 years.
In assessing income tax, the British
Government allows losses to be set
against profits over a period of six years.
The Commonwealth has an averaging
system under which four years’ losses are
taken into account. Queensland allows
losses to be deducted by graziers, but has
a £lOOO limit, and refuses the concession
to agriculturists, fruitgrowers and dairy-
farmers. In a case quoted by the Land
Settlement Advisory Board, State and
Commonwealth extracted £5585 in in-
come taxes from a Winton man whose
returns for eight years showed a net loss
of £1533. Though the Commonwealth
has since modified its exactions, this in-
dicates how handicapped Queensland pas-
toralists are in the struggle with dingoes,
rabbits and blowflies, and how ill-
equipped they find themselves when
drought comes.
Under the election agreement signed
by the U.A.P. bosses and to be signed
by the Cockies
No sitting Government member who
stands for re-election in the constituency
he now represents may be opposed by
either party.
There are duds among the sitting “Gov-
ernment members,” and there is Jarvie,
whose association with McArthur trust
cos. has attracted the unfavorable notice
of a Royal Commissioner ; yet their con-
stituents will have to vote for the duds
and Jarvie or for Langsters. For other
U.A.Ps. or Agrarians to seek election
will not exactly be a crime or mis-
demeanor, but it will be an offence
punishable with expulsion from the
party. Thus are electors’ rights signed
away.
In a raking report on Australian public
libraries, Ralph Munn, of Pittsburg’s Car-
negie institution, and E. R. Pitt, the Mel-
bourne Public Librarian, declare that
Australia was “better supplied in 1880
than it is to-day.” In proportion to
population Westralia has the best public
library and Queensland the worst.
Queensland’s Parliamentary Library
would nevertheless “be an ornament to
the most expensive club.”
Serving only members, ex-members, the
Governor and the Chief Justice, it finds
£525 p.a. for books, periodicals and bind- i
ing. The Public Library, which is supposed
to serve the entire State, is granted only
£302 for the same items. Members of
Parliament seem to be quite blind to the
needs of the people.
Blind they are, and not only in respect
of books.
A foreigner making basket-shoes in
Redfern, Sydney, has sustained his
seventh conviction for breaches of wages
awards; in the latest case he gave a
young woman £1 15s. a week instead of
£4 Is. 9d. The union has been granted
an injunction against him, but it may not
be effectual —the fellow has paid nothing
off fines amounting to £136. This form
of sweating by foreigners has become un-
pleasantly frequent in Melbourne and
Sydney, and it is apt to bring Protection
into disrepute. If offenders cannot be
deported they should be gaoled.

fellow’s case without sacrificing his own.
Woe to the public man who is too fair-
minded! Justice is never done to him
until he is dead.
Vic. Metropolitan Board of Works has
made as much as £31,200 in a twelve-
month from the grazing of cattle on the
Werribee sewage farm. It protests that
it will have to raise its rates if the Gov-
ernment continues to forbid the sale of
prime beasts alleged to have beef measles.
Already the public has had to pay more
for its beef owing to the competition of
the board’s cattle having been stopped.
Two animal-laboratory men at the
Science Congress ridiculed the notion of
beef measles being a danger to man.
Now Professor Woodruff has described
the whole sorry business as “a stunt.”
Cabled that the Golden Stool of Ash-
anti, commandeered by the British when
Prempeh was deposed in 1896, has been
“Gulla-gulla gr-r-r!”
restored amidst imposing functions in
the native fashion.
The ceremonies ended with Prempeh
performing a war dance, amid thousands
of wildly enthusiastic countrymen, to the
accompaniment of war-cries and the beat-
ing of drums.
Why can’t poor old Jack Lang do some-
thing like that? As an electioneering
stunt it would be far more impressive
than ambling through the foxtrot with
members of the Waterloo A.L.P. Younger
Set; “in a delightful atmosphere of
social gaiety,” as his newspaper expresses
it.
Unless Minister Buttenshaw shows that
he possesses a backbone (this has been
doubted), Sydney Cricket Ground is to be
handed over for winter sports to a pro-
fessional football concern, the Rugby
League. No doubt Melbourne Cricket
Ground trustees wish they had a Butten-
shaw to deal with. They have to reckon
with a decision of the Vic. Government
to allot a big wad of its vote for parks
and gardens to constructing a new sports
oval, with seating accommodation for
100,000 people, in Royal Park, north of
the city.
Speaking at Casino (N.S.W.), and giv-
ing some excellent reasons why Britain
should take more butter and meat from
Australia, Earle Page made a queer mis-
statement :
Dairying in Britain is relatively insignifi-
cant.
Relative to what? “Statesman’s Year-
Book” figures for the latest year avail-
able to that publication show the value
of produce sold off British farms at
£258,750,000, of which £79,000,000 came
from dairy produce. And every year
more land in the U.K. is being withdrawn
from agriculture to make pasturage.

with a galaxy of ballet-girls in the Cats-
kill Mountains scene. There was a
presentation afterwards, and I well re-
member Bill’s speech: “All as how I
hopes is I’ll win.” Demosthenes couldn’t
have saitf more or said it better.
“D.”; I first met Bill Beach at the
Sydney Gun Club before the war. A
huge, straight-gazing, solemn-faced cus-
tomer with mountainous shoulders, a 12-
bore looked like a featherweight toy in
his huge hands. He was a first-class
shot, who performed at the time from
the 30-yard mark. He was said then to
be even better at game than he was at
pigeons. In my childhood at Manly the
former blacksmith who had beaten
Hanlan on the Parramatta in record
time, and had licked all-comers in Eng-
land, was a public idol. He retired when
his popularity was at its height (his last
championship race was the one in which
he beat Hanlan on the Nepean), and for
the rest of his long life he did nothing
to diminish Australia’s respect for him,
A model citizen as well as a model
sportsman.
The late Alexander Leeper was a curi-
osity in many ways; apart from being
a linguistic genius who spoke all the
more difficult European tongues, he was
a modern young man of the world with
a profound belief in the Christian reli-
gion. It is said to have been the reli-
gious side of his nature quite as much
as his knowledge of the ins and outs of
international politics that led the King
and Queen to pick on him as tutor for
the present Duke of Kent. He was one
of the very few Australians (they don’t
number a dozen all told) who have en-
tered the British diplomatic service. A
brother is First Secretary at the British
Embassy in Warsaw.
Kalgoorlie has lost perhaps its oldest
inhabitant in Sid Hocking, who passed
out at 75. Four of the Hocking brothers,
an Adelaide family, heard the West call-
ing in the early ’nineties, and three of
them, after helping to found and run
newspapers in Coolgardie, moved on to
Kalgoorlie and brought the “Miner”
into being. That was in ’95, and Sid
had remained there as chief owner and
manager ever since. Mostly he looked
after the commercial side, though he used
to hand in a bit of mining copy in the
early days; he had learned something
of that at Broken Hill. He served two
terms as Mayor over 20 years ago, and
was chairman of the K.R.C. at a later
period.
About a brace of inky adventurers:
Noel Marks and Jack Hetherington, of Mel-
bourne “Sun,” left on the Largs Bay to get
further journalistic experience in Fleet-street.
They are working their way as stewards. At
16 Marks left Hobart for London on the
Cornwall as a stoker, returning as cook’s assist-
ant. Then he stoked his way to Tilbury on the
Ormonde. For some years he has been the
“Sun’s” shipping reporter. Jack Hetherington,
whose column “Here, There and Everywhere,”
by “Jonathan Swift,” is well known to Vic-
torian readers, is making his first trip abroad.
Their “Sun” jobs are waiting for them when
(hey get back in 12 months’ lime.
“Bunny” Hammond has resigned from
Vacuum Oil to rejoin Holden’s Air
Transport Service at Salamaua. When
he resigned from Holden’s, Capt. Ham-
mond was one of their pilots. He has
rejoined as assistant manager.
JUSTICE NICHOLAS, of N. S. Wales.
Here is Justice Nicholas as seen on
Friday when he was sworn in as a mem-
ber of the N. S. Wales Supreme Court
Bench. The ceremony was performed
by an old friend (Jordan, C.J.), and an-
other friend of 30 years’ standing
(Attorney-General Manning) was present,
in addition to the new Judge’s wife and
daughter.
Father W. P. Hackett, the new rector
of Melbourne’s Xavier College, is cheer-
ful and ready for a joke, as a rule, but
on occasion can transform himself into
a Mussolini. An enthusiast in his work
and as punctilious about efficiency as
Henry Ford himself, Father Hackett has
found time to specialise in literature, es-
pecially that of Australia and Ireland. He
comes to Xavier from St, Ignatius
Church, Richmond (Vic.). For a good
many of the 12 years he has spent in
Australia he was at St. Aloysius, Sydney.
“Samson the Second”: Dr. Maloney,
M.H.R., is the complete Socialist. I called
on him in Melbourne and he forthwith
sent out for the materials of entertain-
ment —two threepenny cigars and a box
of matches. I mentioned that I was going
back to the city. “Right, brother,” he
said. “I’ll take you along in my car,”
and led me to a cable-tram. “My car,”
he said with a graceful wave of the hand,
and shouted me a tuppenny ride to
Collins-street.
Sir Harold Gillies, son of the M.L.
M.H.R., recently restored the head and
face of Cynthia Wilson, aged 12, who
was appallingly disfigured in a motor
accident. Counsel at Bucks Assizes,
where the girl got £lOOO damages and
costs, said it was one of the finest jobs on
record. Gillies was born in Dunedin 52
years ago. He is now chief plastic sur-
geon for London City Corporation, St.
Bartholomew’s Hospital and the R.A.F.
Dr. Charles Sabelberg, who died last
week in Melbourne, got on to the basic
idea of moving pictures in conjunction
with a St. Kilda (Vic.) electrician nearly
half a century ago. The catch in his
apparatus—identical in principle with
that in use to-day—was that it needed
millions of plates. Later at Violet Town
(Vic.), while experimenting with electri-
city, he fluked on wireless. For some
years before his death he had been en-
gaged in research into the use of deep-
ray therapy for cancer. His father was
the oldest practising solicitor in Vic-
toria when he died, a year or two back,
at the age of 93,
“Norbell”: Walter Sydney Cornock
(41), who passed on last week at Redfern
(N.S.W.), was a slick comedian and the
cleverest gagger in the profession. I
have seen him come on without knowing
a word of his part and gag it through
without arousing the audience’s suspi-
cion. He was the Bloke in the stage
version of Dennis’s poem. A Sydney
daily, mentioning this, coupled him with
Gilbert Emery, the Ginger Mick of the
silent film. With the item it published
a photo, of a beauty actor labelled
Emery. It was no more like the hard-
faced original (Emery died last year in
Hollywood) than a counterfeit present-
ment of Buddy Rogers,

The late J. H. Whitley was best knows
as the originator of the Whitley Council,
(whose object was to create a better fee
mg between employers and employed)
Seventy-three of them were organised
during the war, but like many an-
other war-dream they faded away after
the Armistice. Whitley first entered the
House of Commons as a pacifist Liberal
during the S’African War. He was
Speaker (1921-28), and he had been chair-
man of the 8.8. C. since 1930.
A queer result of our censorship is
that some Australians, though celebrated
overseas, are unknown in Australia,
Frank Walford is an example. His grini
novel “Twisted Clay,” which was banned
here a few_ days after the appearance of
an enthusiastic Bulletin review, has
gone into two editions in England and
three in America. Walford, who has
packed plenty of adventure into his 50-
odd years, lives in Katoomba and runs
a quarry in the neighborhood.
The pale, aquiline features and jaunty
straw hat of Ellis George Marks, who
was killed in a tram accident in Sydney
last Saturday, were as familiar to fre-
quenters of the upper King-street sector
as Queen Victoria’s statue. He was of
French descent (the family name is La
Marque), and a great-grand-uncle served
as a general under Napoleon. George
Marks, as everybody knew him, was born
at Braidwood, After leaving St. Stanis-
laus, Bathurst, he joined the old “Star.”
He went over to the “Sun” as law re-
porter when it started 25 years ago. He
was the author of several knowledgable
books on the Pacific problem in its rela-
tion to Australia’s defence, and his works
on Napoleon’s strategy earned him many
compliments from senior French officers.
He held an odd record: a member of
the A.J.A. since its inception, he had paid
every subscription in advance to the day
of his death.
“Jeames”: London’s “Sunday Dispatch”
says that Lord Belper, president of Not-
tingham C.C., “must go owing to his
pro-Australianism.” While Lord Belper’s
family has no connection with Australia
there is every reason why he should be
pro-Nottingham. The first baron (the
peerage came into being in 1856) was
Lord-Lieutenant of the County, and the
present peer is a D.L. for Nottingham-
shire ; the family money came from
Notts, and the family estate, though in
Derbyshire, is only a mile or so from
Nottingham town. According to London
“Telegraph,” Lord Belper may be elected
president of the M.C.C. If so, it will be
partly a rebuke to Nottingham cricket,
partly a tribute to the Belper wealth.
M.C.C. presidents are rarely cricketers,
but they must be wealthy and socially
prominent, and it is also essential for
them to be Londoners. Lord Belper
entered the Blues in 1908, and he has been
on the London front practically e vel
since.

Barnet Glass “Checkskid” is a tyre designed especially for today’s
gruelling traffic conditions —of high speed travel over harder,
smoother road surfaces.
Its extra breadth of tread, which contains more actual rubber, gives
extra road grip . . . extra safety . . . extra mileage. Its extra
depth of tread gives longer non-skid tyre-life . . . increased
economy . . . immunity from skids and slipping.
In Barnet Glass “Checkskid,” you also get the advantages of
heat resisting design, which reduces the tendency to generated
heat, the main cause of tyre destruction; unique carcase
construction, which gives extra sidewall flexibility; and superimposed
buttresses which strengthen the shoulders and support this new
“more-rubber” tread.

The latest figures cover the period of the
high price for wool, but metals, dairy
produce and wheat, in which the “Scot-
tish” does a large exchange turnover,
lacked strength in the market, and con-
tinue to do so. Locally, trade improved,
and an extra £1,233,978 net was put
out on advance. Still, deposits, mostly
interest-bearing, continue to pile up ; at
the moment they are more of a hind-
rance than a help to earnings, despite
cuts in the prices paid for them. That is
because of the slow growth in ad-
vances, and because the cuts apply
only to new contracts; old ones
run on to maturity at the old
rate, while the reduction in the
charge for overdrafts has been immedi-
ate and general. Moreover, the debts
question, especially in the wheat areas,
remains a perplexing one. Some growers
are still unable to stand up to interest
payments alone. What the solution of
the problem will be depends partly upon
developments overseas. If these fail to
provide a way out, the banks may have
to offer embarrassed clients a still lower
overdraft rate which will include some-
thing for principal as well as interest.
Meanwhile the figures suggest that
the board has not overlooked the need
to provide for contingencies. Last year’s
gross earnings were £6712 lighter:
1930. 1933. 1934.

The larger business was handled at an
extra cost of £18,900 ; but the taxgath-
erers made off with £27,849 less. After
sending £5OOO to the staff fund, the net
result was 7.2 p.c. on the £3,000,000 of
paid capital as against 7.1, 4.7, 8.7, 17.7,
19.7, 19.6 and 23.1 p.c. back to 1927,
the year in which the Royal, and with it
a snug little Victorian business, was
absorbed.
The div. was kept at 5 p.c., worth 6}
p.c. in Australian notes at the current
rate of exchange, and another £50,000,
shown as written off in the table, was
openly set aside for contingencies. To
pay a 5 p.c. div. plus interest on per-
petual stock —there is £1,872,966 of it,
a reminder of the ’nineties, costing the
co. a shade over 3j p.c.—capital, reserves
and perpetual stock combined need net
only 2\ p.c.
Over the twelvemonth the £5 shares
paid to £3 dropped from £5 15s, to £5
2s. in the market. With exchange as it
is, the return at £5 2s. is 3.6 p.c. on a
5 p.c. div. basis, or 4.4 p.c. should the dis-
tribution rise to 6 p.c., equal to p.c,
in Australian currency.
The most encouraging feature in
balance-sheet figures is the growth in
advances: —

Most of the extra £3,084,579 of deposits
gathered during the year went into low-
interest-bearing liquids, up £2,180,913,
making them equal to 45.6 p.c. of the lia-
bilities to the public. It is plain that
a lot of money is still seeking the shelter
of the banks rather than the risk of
enterprise.
Incidentally, the request that the Fed-
eral Government should appoint a com-
mission to inquire into the Australian
banking and monetary systems is not be-
cause the banks are making fat profits,
but because many people have woolly
ideas about bank and other credit.

The business provided a fortune for its
founder, J. C. Williamson, and some rich
returns after he died in 1907. But since
the public became interested —it put up
£150,000 of 8 p.c. pref. money in 1924,
mainly to pay off the debt on Her
Majesty’s Theatre block, Sydney—the
talkies, broadcasting, economic develop-
ments and taxation changed the outlook,
and the pref. div. had fallen £40,575 into
arrears when the books last closed.
In Dec. last the prefs. agreed to cancel
the arrears and reduce the div. from
8 p.c. (6.2 p.c. after allowing for the
statutory cut) to 6 p.c. cumulative, with
the right to advance with the ords. up to
8 p.c., after the latter had had 6 p.c.
In return for these concessions they re-
ceive 20,000 f.p. pref. shares, two for 15,
thus raising pref, capital to £170,000.
Also, the managing directors and the
co.’s London representative have agreed
to reduce aggregate payments under their
service agreements (Dec. 1, 1932, to July
3, 1937) from £13,390 p.a. to £9360 p.a.
But when the prefs. have had 6 p.c. and
the ords. 3 p.c. (together £22,850) any re-
maining profit is to be used to reduce
the balance of £4030 p.a. due under the
contracts just referred to. If profits are
insufficient to cover this balance, those
concerned will continue to receive an
aggregate of £lBO a week after July 3,
1937, until the slate is cleaned ; mean-
while they shall not be entitled to any
further remuneration from the co.

ings have suffered:

The lease of Her Majesty’s Theatre
premises (Sydney) to Woolworths, and
other adjustments, helped last year’s
figures. The £9378 netted was £822 short
of the minimum pref. div. on capital as
it now stands.
Prospects of further substantial im-
provement in earnings depend mainly
upon satisfactory theatrical attractions.
Other adjustments which should help are
the sale of shares in the Theatre Royal,
Melbourne, substitution of a mortgage
for the overdraft (£211,058 at June 30,
1933) and transfer to the co. of the
Regent Theatre freehold, Sydney, together
with an unspecified amount of mort-
gage, in place of shares in and advances
to a subsidiary.

sheet figures show it:

ances by £116,813. Shares in other cos.,
mostly Hoyts, are down £113,123. In-
cluding these at face value, the debt ex-
ceeded more or less liquids by £296,976,
an increase of £205,025 during the twelve-
month.
At 235. 6d. the prefs. return 5.1 p.c.

interim div, at the rate of 6 p.c. p.a. last
month.

The £16,472 of profit was made up of
£5139 (up £2496) from Australian sources
and £11,333 (down £336) from outside the
Commonwealth. Returns from Vic. and
Westralia were the most encouraging;
there was very slight improvement in N.
S. Wales, and retrogression in S. Aus.,
where Government authorisation of
betting shops affected racecourse attend-
ances. After handing the prefs. their
£3875 (10 p.c. less 224 p.c. statutory
cut), there was enough to give the ords.
an'extra 1 p.c., making 6 p.c. for the year,
and put £lOB7 on the shelf. In addition
to the reserves shown in the table there
is £124,658 to set against the £lOO,OOO
at which the ord. shares in the French
subsidiary appear and an unspecified
amount of patents, etc.
During the year the manager went
abroad, and made “satisfactory” arrange-
ments for settlement of outstanding
debts in the U.S.A. and Britain, and a
contract extending the use of the co.’s
machine in Florida, U.S.A., for another
five years was entered into. Owing to
the inability or unwillingness of Euro-
pean clubs to finance installation of the
co.’s machines, no business was done
there. The board is optimistic about
the future.

Leaving the holding in the French sub-
sidiary out of the reckoning, but includ-
ing other shares and stocks, the year’s
improvement in the more or less liquid
surplus (£83,988) was £8268.
The French offshoot has £200,000 of
capital, one half 10 p.c. cum. prefs. (now
less 22y p.c. statutory cut) and the other
half ords. The parent took the ords. in
part payment for rights, etc., and guaran-
teed the pref. div., in which respect it has
been called upon for over £25,000, Dur-
ing the last term the pup earned enough
to pay its own pref. div. and hand back
£2287 to the parent, leaving £20,070 of
div. advances still to be wiped off.
Since 1918 the parent’s divs. have
averaged 5.5 p.c., including a 25 p.c.
bonus (£47,956), paid from £lOO,OOO re-
ceived for the English rights. The market
notes this and prices the pound ords. at
20s. 4d., at which figure the return is 5.9
p.c. on a 6 p.c. div. basis. At 245. the
prefs. return 6.4 p.c. on a 1\ p.c. distri-
bution. Excluding shares in the French
co., the net asset backing is £5 12s. 2d.
prefs. and 245. ords.

The outlook for this co., which runs a
chain of drapery stores scattered through
Vic., S. Aus., N. S. Wales and Tas., looks
brighter than at any time during’the last
half-dozen years. When the present co.
took over the business in 1922, there
were 50 stores in the chain ; now there
are 93, of which two —one at Burnie
(Tas.) and another at Kaniva (Vic.) —
were opened during the last term. Slump
and the board’s policy of property pur-
chase, to finance which the co. went a
bit into debt, stood in the way of the
ords. in 1931. Still, an overhaul of the
organisation and interest and rent reduc-
tions, etc., cleared the way for recovery
of profits when the tide turned.
Early in the last term there was a rush
to take up £200,000 of 6 p.c. B prefs.
The money was used mostly to reduce
the overdraft, down £187,434:

Other encouraging features are a reduc-
tion of £29,932 in stocks and of
£29,625 in debtors’ balances (£16,476);
they suggest a livelier cash turnover.
Including stocks, the improvement in the
more or less liquid surplus (£319,486)
was £179,925, due to reduction of the
overdraft. Continued expansion of the
business is reflected in the addition of
£19,286 to the book value of freeholds
and of £11,387 to plant.
Gross earnings, which fell from
£274,562 in ’2B to £180,292 in ’32, were
£218,904 (up £17,447) last year. The
net result, which benefited by £4030 of
the increase, was enough to pay the pref.
divs. and show a shade over 6 p.c. on
ord. capital as against 5.9, 1.1, 0.8, 6.1,
5.7 and 27.1 p.c. back to 1928. The div
was lowered a point to 5 p.c.
Since the close of accounts, the Foots
cray (Vic.) premises have been sold, and
the stock transferred to a new branch a t
Tumut (N.S.W.); two more new
N. branches, one at Lockhart and
another at Yass, will be opened presently
At 28s. 9d. the 7 p.c. first prefs. return

Sale of the London business (it used to
provide about two-thirds of the net earn-
ings) at a profit of £362,587 in 1928 left
the co. with its Australian interests and
more money than it knew what to do
with. Three years later half the capital
was returned. Thus the ords., who re-
ceived a one-for-one bonus issue in
1928, have had their original capital re-
turned in full, and still retain an interest
in the business equal to their former
holding ; when the books last closed they
could still see 575. 6d. a share in net tan-
gibles.
The balance of the sale money was put
out mostly on mortgage ; £lO,OOO was
invested in a new subsidiary for the
manufacture of waxed-paper containers.
But trading losses, due to slump, seasonal
conditions and price-cutting, gobbled
most of the returns from investments in
’3l and ’32. Then the tide turned; the
co. put new lines of fruit-juices on the
market, undertook the manufacture of
ice-cream cones, and turnover rose 23
p.c. in ’33 and 30 p.c. last year, when
the subsidiary sent along 5 p.c. as against
4 p.c. for the previous term.
The parent’s own trade doesn’t appear
to have turned in much, if any,
profit. The £13,296 netted was only £l6B
more than the previous year’s return
from investments —what they turned in
last year is not disclosed. After paying
the pref. div. (£1000) enough remained
to show 9.2 p.c. on ord. capital as against
4.3 p.c. and 3.4 p.c. for the two preced-
ing terms, and the div. was lifted a point,
making it 6 p.c.
During the year £20,119 net was added
to the book value of fixed assets, and the
co. is well equipped to further extend its
activities; —-

ASSURANCE
THE business or professional man who says to his fellow-
directors, or to his partner: “Let’s take out more Assur-
ance,” makes no mistake. It is what many of the wealth-
iest and shrewdest men in the community are doing to-day.
There is no investment so sound as A.M.P. Assurance; none
that provides such peace of mind.
Take partners. There are several A.M.P. methods under
which, in the event of one partner dying, the surviving partner
may have the money with which to “buy out” the interests
of the deceased. One method will suit the requirements of this
partnership best; another method will best suit the require-
ments of that partnership. The methods are devised to meet
the varying needs of business and professional men.
The most commonly used of these methods provides that the
surviving partner shall not only have the money to buy out
the interests of the deceased partner, but shall retain a policy
on his own life with all its bonus additions as well. Different
partnership requirements, different policies. Wise partners
will ask that a representative of the Society be sent to discuss
with them ways and means of securing the most protection for
the least investment. This representative will be able to
demonstrate how A.M.P. bonuses make such policies so extra-
ordinarily satisfactory.

The improvement over the last three
vtnrs has been due mainly to the State
Government’s efforts to mitigate the
effects of Lang’s misrule, to the low return
from Consols and other Stock Exchange
securities and bank deposits, and to a
slight reduction in taxation. Owing to the
influence of the Harbor Bridge and
delay in completing the City Railway,
properties between Bridge-street and
Circular Quay and between York-street
and Darling Harbor are a problem to
their owners these days.
Last year R. and W.’s sales totalled
£7OO 516 as against £549,250 the year
before. Gross earnings (£20,605) were
£3149 better, and the net result benefited
by £2619 of the increase, reaching 7 p.c.
on capital as against a shade over 2 p.c.
in ’33. The drought for shareholders
which began in ’3l was broken with a
6 p.c. div. For the decade to the close
of accounts in ’3O divs. averaged 20.6
p.c.; but that is no guide to the future
of this class of business.
If advances are readily realisable, prac-
tically the whole of the co.’s assets are
liquid:

Yellowdine
Publication of disappointing results
from two drill holes, put down to test
continuation at depth of the main ore-
body, found between the surface and
water level (about 50ft.), at Yellowdine
(W.A.), caused a sensation on the London
stock market at the end of last month,
and the price of shares in Commonwealth
Mining and Finance and Anglo-Austra-
uan Gold Development and others in-
terested in the field fell sharply. There
was a reaction on Australian ’Changes,
of course. From the market point of
view, however, Australians foresaw pos-
sibilities on this field earlier than London
did.
Of the two holes referred to, one,

Gold in Fiji
T. R. Victor, mining engineer for Aus-
tralian Gold Development, is favorably
impressed with the possibilities of a 100-
acre lease at Tavua, on the northern side
of Viti Levu, one of the Fiji group. The
ground, which adjoins the Emperor —on
which four' lodes, now being developed
by E. G. Theodore and John Wren, have
been disclosed —on the south, is ex-
pected to embrace the main Emperor
line for the full length of the lease,
about 2000 ft. In the Emperor the
lode at one point is 70ft. wide on
the 100 ft. level, assaying 30dwt. for
the full length of the drive. It is a con-
tact deposit, running north and south,
with walls of andesite, and it appears to
occur as a replacement along a shear
zone ; thus in some respects it resembles
the Lucknow (N.S.W.) field. The trouble
with this class of formation is the diffi-
culty of proving the actual extent of the
deposit, and therefore the life of the
mine. The only work done on the area
has been the driving of a 95-foot tunnel,
which has cut two lodes ; one, at 28ft., is
13ft. wide, averaging 20dwt., the other,
at 80ft., is 15ft. wide, averaging 6dwt.
Going west up the hill, lode floaters are
visible, some carrying high values.
On another 100-acre lease, the Cardi-
gan, about a mile south-west of the Em-
peror, a 20ft. crosscut from No. 1 shaft,
55ft. deep, has disclosed average values of
12ydwt., and 24dwt. stuff is visible in a
south drive. A 25ft. crosscut from No. 2
shaft, 50ft. deep, shows 21dwt. stone. No.
3 shaft, 80ft. deep, is to be sunk another
20ft., and the lode again tested by cross-
cut. On the Cardigan the gold-bearing
shoot is at least 200 ft. long, with an
average width of 20ft. to 25ft.
Sunshine Gold Development
Those on the register at Feb. 8 will be
offered 72,000 new 10s. shares at a pre-
mium of ss. each, six for ten. When
fully paid, the issue will bring in £54,000,
including £lB,OOO of share premiums,
making paid capital £96,000. The new
money is wanted to pay for sluicing
equipment (estimated cost £37,000) to
work the co.’s Consolidated claims on
the Watut, New Guinea, and to meet the
final payment (£5000) to the vendor. The
remaining £12,000 will be available for
testing the co.’s other options.
Proved ground on the Consolidated
area totals 2,129,000 c.y., estimated to
be worth £401,890 in Australian cur-
rency with gold at £8 10s. an ounce.
Costs are put at 7d. a yard (= £62,095),
and royalty at 5 p.c. on gross value
is £20,094, leaving a surplus of
£319,701. The plant is expected to treat
25,000 c.y. a month, thus giving the
measured area a life of approximately
seven years. The £319,701 is sufficient

“E.T.L.”: Major W. A. Wills joined
the board of Star Explorations, Ltd., in
1934 He is chairman and managing
director of Gold Options Syndicate, Gold
Corporation, Ltd., and Nigel Van Ryn
Reefs Ltd., which three are very active
in London. This has suggested to some
that the Star Co., which increased capital
in 1934 may take a more active part in
goldmining in the Southern Hemisphere
Nigel Van Ryn Reefs Ltd has Herbert
Gepp (also a director) and L. C. Stuckey
as consulting engineers. The co. is inter-
ested to a considerable extent in Lamp-
lough G. M. Co. and Monument Hill
(Bendigo). Lamplough is under the con-
trol of the Oroville Dredging Group, and
should have plenty of money behind it.

“Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round”
Last week present critic tried to call
Mae West in “Belle of the ’Nineties” a
diseuse ; so poor is his writing that it
came out “danseuse.” Something of the
sort happened to the director of the new
show at Sydney Plaza ; he tried to tell
a horror yarn of the high seas, but his
stars were too strong for him, and the
thing turned into a variety entertainment.
Mitzi Green gives an uncannily life-
like imitation of George Arliss. There
is an amusing cod on broadcasting. The
ballets are original as well as beautiful;
in one the chorines arrange themselves in
patterns which resemble stars, sunbursts
and other examples of the jeweller’s art.
Gene Raymond, as an incredibly beauti-
ful and dressy young cardsharper and
jewel-thief, wins the heart of Nancy Car-
roll, an incredibly young and innocent
principal ballerina. Sydney Howard sup-
plies plenty of low comedy as a chroni-
cally soused passenger. There are two
murders, but they have little to do with
the story proper, which leads up inex-
orably to the moral regeneration of Mr.
Walter Widdop in “Tristan and Isolde,"
at Sydney New Tiv.
Raymond. No pantomime has offered a
more startling transformation scene
than the one on the liner’s boat deck in
which he turns in a split second from
brazen crime to smiling, open-faced
honesty.
“The Human Side”
Adolphe Menjou is the hero of this
at times painfully sentimental study of
American domesticity. Adolphe is a pro-
ducer of stage plays who has been lured
by a vile-tempered leading lady from his
wife (Doris Kenyon) and four delightful
children. The wife divorces him, and is
on the verge of marrying another —a
moneyed figure of fun whose respectful
kisses are endured with manifest loath-
ing. Members of the audience sniff hard
as the faithful creature removes her wed-
ding ring in the privacy of her bedroom
on the night before the sacrifice and de-
posits it sadly in a drawer among other
relics of the romantic past.
Suddenly Adolphe ditches the leading
lady, outwits his rival (who turns out to
be unworthy as well as ridiculous), se-
cures a lucrative position in California
and is reunited to his wife, to the wild
delight of the children and the brilliant
family dog.
The acting is exceptionally good ; par-
ticularly that of Menjou and Betty Law-
ford, who plays his flapper daughter.
“Lily of Killarney”
Here are no grim Liam O’Flaherty-
esque gunmen, no blasphemous Sean
O’Caseyesque peat-gatherers brutally
striking down their poteen-soaked
mothers. It is an Erin wholly compact
of shamrock sentimentalities.
John Garrick is the traditional
squireen who dispenses hospitality with
an open hand, though he owes £lO,OOO
on his property. Gina Malo is the col-
leen whom he wants to wed, though
marriage to another would redeem him
from bankruptcy. Dorothy Boyd is the
good and lovely sister who could save
the situation by selling herself in mar-
riage to the cad who holds the mortgage.
A sporting priest, a crack-brained ser-
vant, a bevy of young bloods in hunting
kit, a humorous pursuit by the R.I.C.
and the horserace which decides Gar-
rick’s fate also come into it; and there
are 10 songs, including “Father O’Flynn”
and “My Little Gig.” At Sydney May-
fair,
“I Lived with You”
This is another screen version of an-
other play written by Ivor Novello to
emphasise the lush loveliness of Ivor
Novello, The veteran fascinator is
Prince Felix Lenieff this time, a Rus-
sian exile who is sheltered by a Cock-
ney family. Respectable Mr. Wallis
(Eliot Makeham) is induced to consort
with a blackmailing street-walker, and a
daughter (Ida Lupino) to experiment with
free love. The wife (Minnie Raynor)
becomes an alcoholic. Novello is for
ever Ivor, the Flappers’ Idol; and
the acting of his feeders is adequate.
But it doesn’t bear the remotest resem-
blance to life. At the Mayfair.
“The White Parade”
This Regent film does as much (or as
little) for U.S.A. nurses’ training-schools
as Hollywood has already done for
naval, air force and military training-
schools. The probationers (probs.) have
six months of hard work, and only one
night off a week —and that only till mid-
night. Those who fail to stand up to
the tests are adjudged unworthy of fol-
lowing in the footsteps of Florence
Nightingale—the matron lays much stress
on the lineal descent of all good nurses
from the Crimean heroine—and are
bumped out.
One of the younger girls gives herself
up to love’s delights and attempts sui-
cide. The wife of the “kindest, most
loved and respected” doctor in the hos-
pital departs with a gigolo. Loretta
Young falls in love with John Boles, a
millionaire polo-player, and he wants her
to marry him. She doesn’t; good nurses
don’t.
A pity in ways. She’s too pretty to
have much expectation of life as a nurse,
and he’s handsomer than 99 per cent, of
millionaires. However, remembering the
fate of the other amorists, the onlooker
decides that it may be just as well.
Muriel Brunskill in “Tristan and Isolde.”
Boles hasn’t much to do; none of the
men has. Jane Darwell adds to the
quality of the film as the matron, and
a half-dozen girls do capably. Women
should like it.
“Helldorado”
Once upon a time there was a pros-
pector who struck it rich and founded
the extensive town of Helldorado, clus-
Horace Stevens in “Tristan and Isolde."
tered round his fabulously wealthy gold-
mine. The prospector went east to claim
his bride, and wasn’t heard of again.
The prospector’s partner mislaid the mine
and went mad, and the town went phut.
Fifty years afterwards the prospector’s
grandson (Richard Arlen), a promoter of
dud companies, stumbled upon the de-
serted village in a rainstorm. Arlen,
Ralph Bellamy, a multi-millionaire,
Madge Evans, a multi-multi-millionairess
with whom Bellamy is eloping, and about
a dozen assorted comic characters were
marooned there by floods and enter-
tained by the crazy old partner of the
original prospector while lurv dawned
between Arlen and Miss Evans. When
they got back to civilisation Arlen
claimed to have rediscovered the lost
mine, and precipitated a rush to the
locality. As he was about to be lynched
by a disappointed mob Miss Evans found
the prospector’s missing will, including
title deeds-to and plan of mine, and for-
mally handed them to Arlen as rightful
heir. A signal for wedding bells to jingle
softly symbolically in the distance.
This beautiful and original story is un-
folded at Sydney Capitol. The most
touching part is the rain, which falls with
week-end force throughout the first three-
quarters of an hour. It is calculated to
make exiles from Sydney shed homesick
tears.
“Sing as We Go”
A musical story at Sydney Lyceum for
Grade Fields. J. B. Priestley is -respon-
sible, and he has crammed it with Priest-
ley eccentrics, of whom Maire O’Neill’s
Madame Osiris is about the best. Gracie
is a happy-go-lucky ex-mill girl who gets
a job in Blackpool. She tries everything,
is defeated continually, and continually
bobs up and sings as only she can. Her
art would be almost unbearable in any-
one else, but she puts it over. “In My
Little Bottom Drawer” is typical.
She sees her friend Dorothy Hyson
winning the love of the mill-manager,
John Loder, whom she (Gracie) adores ;
helps the romance along with a breaking
heart; and so back to the mill as wel-
fare officer,
“Wild Boy”
If Nat Gould had lived long enough
to go tin-hare-racing he might have
written such a story as this Sydney Civic
attraction. Nat fans will recognise nearly
all the characters. The father of Mar-
jorie (Gwyneth Lloyd) dies and leaves
her a pile of debts and a string of grey-
hounds. Her sterling friend is Billy
(Sonnie Hale). Redfern (Lyn Harding)
is the villain who forges, steals and
attempts murder to gain his end, and
Leonora Corbett is the vampire who aids
him and intrudes in the Billy-Marjorie
romance. Finally, there is the wonder
dog Wild Boy, who at the fifty-ninth
second wins the race for honesty.
The scenes at London White City are
excellent, and Messrs. Flanagan and
Allen, who combine bookmaking with
auctioneering, supply the laughs. h
“Paris Interlude”
Take a Parisian background as re ore
sented by cocktail bars, a fashion P
and the Four Arts Ball, mix the
The Girl I Left Behind Me” and “Neve
Introduce Your Donah to a Pal,” throw
in extracts from a. newsreel showing th>
finish of a trans-Atlantic air flight
sweeten with mush and spice with Ameri
can slang and you’ll get a confection that
doesn’t differ materially from this Civic
film. The hero is Otto Kruger, a boozv
war-wreck who earns his living by writ
ing descriptions of stunt flights He
leaves his betrothed (Madge Evans) to
fulfil an assignment, and she registers
the emotions of a forsaken but brave-
hearted gal. Robert Young is Kruger's
pal who looks after Madge, saves her
from marrying a wealthy but unimagina
tive Babbitt, falls in love with her, stands
nobly aside when Kruger returns and
finally wins her after an equally thrilling
gesture of renunciation on the part of
Kruger.
“His Double Life”
When Arnold Bennett’s “Buried Alive”
was turned into a play the dramatist
thought it necessary not only to alter
the title but also the name of the prin-
cipal character. The same priciples have
been followed in the talkie at Mel-
bourne Lyceum. The cast is English,
except for Lilian Gish. Continuity is
well preserved, there is a wealth of beau-
tiful country and street scenes, and the
photography is first-class. The weakness
is one common to English productions:
the climax is rushed as if somebody had
charged;, in ' with a stopwatch and told
all hands to be off the lot inside five
minutes. The acting is good, especially
that of Lilian Gish, now middle-aged, and
Roland Young as the shy artist who
attends his own funeral. Young is
reminiscent of Charles Ruggles at his
best in this film.
Some First Nights
“Nightstick,” a play of American
gangsterdom, Sydney Studio Theatre
Club’s latest offering, was presented
under G. Forsythe’s direction at the
Emerson Hall. Outstanding were Hay
Simpson as a detective and Jerry Neil-
sen as a crook, Kathleen O’Neill had
her moments, though she was a rather
impassive heroine, and Russell Oakes
was a badly miscast cop.
* * *
“Music in the Air,” in which Sylvia
Welling introduced herself to the Sydney
public, has been revived at the Royal. It
has lost none of its popularity, and the
cast could hardly have given a better-
performance than it did last Saturday.
Cecil Kellaway was in especially good
form as Lessing, the music-teacher, and
Miss Welling was as endearing as before
as Frieda, the volatile prima donna.
Mae West in “Belle of the ’Nineties,” at
Sydney Prince Edward.
Sydney Burchall’s Bruno had the ad

ABORIGNALITIES
“O. W. Waireki”: Henare, spending
his first night in a city hotel, shared a
double room. Retiring late he noticed
his sleeping companion’s shoes outside
the door, and other pairs at intervals
along the passage. He pondered for a
time ; then he removed his own footwear,
secured his room-mate’s, and, wrapping
them neatly in brown paper with his
own, went off smiling downstairs.
Next morning he was awakened very
early by his companion, who said that
he thought his shoes had been stolen.
Smilingly Henare shook his head. “You
peen werry lucky they not pinched,” he
said. “Soon as 1 see they not allowed in
te flash rooms, I take t’em with mine to
be safe in te office.”
* * * *
“Limpopo”: According to the Rho-
desian newspapers a satisfactory way of
dealing with the locust plague is being
adopted there. It is used when the in-
sects are on the wing. Aeroplanes fly
across the path of the advancing horde
releasing a fine cloud of sodium arsenite.
Flying into this, the locusts are destroyed
in millions. Something of the sort
might be tried here with the ’hoppers.
Our military aeroplanes and the people
who man them lead a comparatively idle
existence. What’s the matter with start-
ing them out on a job of this kind,
which would be valuable to the country
generally and to themselves in experi-
ence ?
“Hamer”: My own idea for grappling
with the grasshoppers deserves considera-
tion. It is very simple. Send our artil-
lery all over the place firing guns, the
Air Force the while dropping bombs —
the noisiest it has. If the job is done
properly the grasshopper grubs will be
deafened; unable to hear the call of
spring, they will remain inactive while
the farmer oils his haymaking and wheat-
stripping implements in peace. When
they do wake up they will find nothing to
destroy. Realising what has happened
to them, they will break their hearts;
then the ducks can be let loose to fatten
on the remains, and so the pest will be
ended. There is only one weak point in
the scheme. Have we the artillery and
the Air Force?
* * *
“G.C.” (Burketown, N.Q.): New Year
was ushered into the Gulf country by a
duststorm straight from Bedourie (no-
thing new though ; they’ve been coming
at us all the summer). One of the worst
droughts ever known in these parts has
been raging for the last few months.
Cattle have been dying in thousands —
some of the smaller properties have lost
everything. Even the hardy wallaby has
succumbed ; they are found dead every-
where, whilst others are too weak to
move away from an approaching car.
The abos. also are having a thin time,
and complain that “no meat longa wal-
laby, goanna, porcupine—alia same skin
and bone.”
* * * *
“Williami”; At Tahmoor (N.S.W.) a
man who is cursed with a vehicle which
looks like a cross between a traymobile
and a motor-car was stuck up about a
mile from his home when the engine
conked out for good and all. He decided
to abandon the car, and walked home ;
but thoughtlessly he let his dog off the
chain. Immediately, the hound com-
menced searching the scrublands for the
car, and found it. Jumping into the back
seat he took charge, assuming possibly
that some lunatic might want to steal it.
He could not be convinced to the con-
trary, and his owner couldn’t coax him
to relax his vigil. To save the dog’s life
the car had to be pushed home by an
organised party of neighbors. When in
its customary place at home the dog
jumped out and made himself comfort-
able for the night.

“C.J.8.”: “Bogaduck” (B. 9/1/’35) is
rash in stating that an east wind always
makes a country-house chimney smoke.
The eccentric behavior of his chimney is
apparently due to the design of the house.
A temporary increase in the velocity of
the wind causes a partial vacuum to
form around one of the openings to the
kitchen, resulting in an exodus of air
through the opening and a consequent
inrush down the chimney. A careful
study of the principle employed in an
ordinary hand atomiser for liquid insec-
ticide will explain how the air is drawn
out through the door or window.

“Tender”; A queer diving fatality is
reported from Torres Strait. A Japanese
diver went down in the trifling depth of
six fathoms and later bobbed up minus
helmet and corselet. He was alive, but
died soon after being taken on board
his lugger. Though the report does not
say so, he was presumably wearing only
“Sorry, Jacky it’s agin the law to give liquor to
abas.”
"This pfeller no abo., boss —him bin sunbaking!”
the helmet and corselet without the
“dress” which is occasionally employed
for shallow diving—in the full suit he
wouldn’t have been able to rid himself
of the heavy copper head- and breast-
pieces unaided. If he had managed to
cut away the fabric of the “suit” so as
to detach the metal parts, he would have
had no air to bring him to the top ; if
naked, this would ha,ve come about natur-
ally. It is possible a giant groper got his
head in its cavernous mouth, as "it did
with the Thursday Island skin diver who
was for long the star turn for exhibition
to tourists there, and tore the helmet off.
“Katounga”: My Japanese trepang
skin divers in Northern Australian waters
feared gropers more than sharks. My
head man came up on sighting one which
he reckoned was at least 12 fget in
length. The brutes are fond of lying
asleep in submarine caves with their
mouths wide open; the Japanese told
me that one of the size observed could
swallow a man at one gulp. Some years
back a groper was caught off the Port
Darwin jetty by a Chinaman. It was
nearly eight feet in length, and was esti-
mated to weigh over 5001 b.
* * * *
“Rachets”: Leaving the size of abo.
feet to “Airline” and his friends (B.
23/1 /’35), I should like to certify that
the abo. male, in the days when I knew
him well, used to possess remarkably
small and well-fashioned hands. Whether
this was due to the fact that his women
did all the hard work, as has been sug-
gested, I can’t say ; but more than one
old mounted-police official —including
“Jacky-Jacky” Ahearn, “Black” Douglas,
Murray and others who began their
police careers with the Queensland Black
Police —have told me of the trouble they
experienced in keeping the handcuffs
made for white men on the wrists of the
more slenderly-built abos. Later I myself
was to find the same difficulty with the
Papuan natives until a solution was
arrived at, as it had been in Queensland,
by the special manufacture of small-sized
wristlets.
“R.N.C.”: Travelling about 460 miles
south of Pt. George Mission station
(W.A.) I met an abo. who had five fingers
and a thumb on each hand, and six toes.
It was while offering him “baccy” that
I noticed his malformations, of which he
didn’t seem to be aware.
* * * *
“Cam Cove”: In the Picton (N.S.W.)
district there is a kookaburra who is
earning a bad reputation for his kin.
He’s a chicken-killer. Jack hides in a
tree, and if the chick is left unsheltered
for a moment its next address will be the
same as the kooka’s. Sometimes he
will come with a grub and entice a
chicken close enough to the wire-netting
for him to get a scissors hold; then
there’ll be one chicken less in the coop.
* * * *
“32 x 40”: Tell “Splodger” (B. 2/1 /’35)
that after the Toolebuc experiment of
stag-dingo crossing the Noolan brothers
shot a lot of these half-breeds, and that
many a grazier has cursed the memory of
those experimenters. Even to-day pure
white dingoes (Borzois-dingo cross) are
being trapped and poisoned on the Six-
Mile and Pathunga Gorge country. If I
could communicate with the late Fitzroy
Trotman (Superintendent, Gregory North
Rabbit Board) I would ask him to write
Splodger” a full account of the time
when a pack of stag-dingoes attacked his
camels, pulled them down and ate them.

“C.R.W.”: Strange bait to catch fish (R
12/12/’34)? Fishing for English perch at
the Laanecoone Weir, on the River Lod
don (Vic.), I ran out of bait—and the red
fin was biting well. Whilst having
midday snack of tomato sandwiches ]

small piece of tomato I gave it a fly h

On another occasion, at the same spot
I tried the red gills of the perch, and
this also was taken readily.
* * * *
“Kieta”: Vic. Mallee gangers have
been at their wits’ end this summer to
keep railways clear of sand. One night a
train going north came to a standstill in
drift sand. The train crew set to work to
clear the line, but the job beat them.
Deciding to return to Sea Lake, they
found that, whilst they were furiously
digging ahead, somebody’s paddocks
were piling up on the line behind them.
Eventually a gang of 30 men cleared the
rails, only to find a little further on that
the line was seven feet under sand. A
duststorm was raging when they tackled
the job, and almost as fast as they
shovelled the sand to one side it came in
from the other.
* * * *
“Barrabindi”; Cecil Freer, who is
buffalo-shooting in Northern Australia,
once tried to see how many beasts he
could drop in one gallop. When he had
shot 26 his arm was so tired that he
couldn’t raise it to continue the work.
Cec always reckons that he can’t see how
Ben Martin and Paddy Cahill could have
dropped 48 and 36 respectively in one
run. Freer’s buffalo camp is at Wild-
man’s River. The hides come into the
port by his lugger, the Venture, which
can carry 450 a trip ; the run is about
70 miles.
* * *
“Dungeness”: Something seems to be
going wrong with Canberra. Repeatedly
during the last few weeks its recorded
temperatures have exceeded those of Bris-
bane, which torrid city is, as Canberra’s
most recent champion freely admits,
quite unfitted for white habitation on
account of the heat. While Brisbane was
well down in the 80’s, the capital beside
the Molonglo has been soaring over the
90’s. Adelaide at 108, Sydney at 107,
Melb. at 104 may be admitted —it is not
much over a century since it was vigor-
ously argued that white children born in
Sydney were doomed to fragility and
early death by the climate —but for Can-
berra to behave that way seems to be
against the Constitution. What is the
Commonwealth Meteorologist doing?
* * * *
“Ariki”: Nobbier and 1 were a bit
young, and to the storekeeper in the
Bay of Islands (M.L.) who took out
kauri gum and supplied the necessaries ol
life we were easy marks. When the time
drew near for us to shift camp Nobbier
propounded a scheme for balancing the
account. Our gum brought 4d. a pound,
and was good gum ; our meat cost 4d. a
pound and was mostly bones. The plan
was to roll a hot boulder in gum dus
and palm it off with our nuggets, and
we started to put it into effect. Sud-
denly the peaceful welkin was rent by
the grandfather of an explosion which
sent fragments of pots, pans, stew an
embers hurtling to the skies. By a
miracle neither of us was hurt. A( tel
a gasp or two I expressed the opinion
that the affair was a judgment of Provi-
dence on our iniquity. Nobbier was im-
penitent. Next day he made a new selec-
tion of boulders, and our infamous
scheme was crowned with success,
wonder whether his conscience will snn
him should this par. meet his eye and re
mind him of his iniquitous youth.

“Notaden”: S.Q. fishermen are feeling
anxious over the delayed appearance o
the Spanish mackerel. Ordinarily,
“jacks,” a spotted species averaging tr°
51b. to 101 b., arrive early in Decern b .
and are followed towards the end ot

BALLADE TO BEER.
You balladists who blithely sing
Of ladies’ eyes and love’s delight,
Of rose-red lips, round arms that cling,
And dreams below the moon at night;
Of ships at sea and birds in flight
And castles that in dreams you rear;
One thing you have forgotten quite—
The blessing and the boon of beer.
I am not moved to subtly string
Sweet words and syllables to cite
My rapture at first signs of spring
Or grief when winds of winter bite,
Nor mournful moving lines indite
That love grows cold and flowers sere;
For this alone my lyre I smite;
The blessing and the boon of beer.
The lands whereto I crave to wing
As swallows do, in dreams invite
By virtue of no other thing
Than that their malt and hops i might
Consume abundantly. Though slight
My chance of sampling these, I fear,
Hope lives while brims in beakers bright
The blessing and the boon of beer.
You balladists may wail the plight
Of loves and snows of yesteryear.
I celebrate—all else is trite —
The blessing and the boon of beer.

“Exposure”: Not only artists but
press photographers should take more
care. A Great Daily recently showed two
axemen presumably falling a tree from
springboards in the Dorrigo (N.S.W.).
One was wearing blacker boots. The
other, evidently preparing to swing as his
mate’s axe came out of the cut, was in
such a position that if he had swung he
would have jambed his hand on the tree,
barked his elbow and overbalanced,
probably slicing a piece out of his mate
in the act.

whilst tail fins of fi£, ane ° f the body ’

The mechanical outcome of these dif-
ferent arrangements is that the normal
tail action of a whale propels it upward
to the surface ; that of a fish drives it
downwards. The whale needs air to
breathe ; the fish does not, and also finds
shelter from enemies by going down.
Hence the essential locomotive mechan-
ism of each is adapted for its particular
vital needs. Baby whales have to be
taught to dive, and it is extremely inter-
esting to watch the firm, businesslike way
the mothers go about the job of educat-
ing them. That is if you are in a suffi-
ciently big boat. Last October I nearly
got drowned by a mother and child doing
diving lessons together.

“W. le R.” (Melville Island); Your
head-boy wins his bet, “Diba-More” (B.
24/10/’34); the eggs he found were
snake’s eggs, even though the legs on the
young suggested otherwise. My “boys”
are constantly bringing
them to me, and when
cooked blackfellow
fashion, in the ashes, are a
delicacy not lightly to be
scorned. The eggs of the
carpet-snake are usually
found in clusters, some-
what resembling a bunch
of grapes. Each egg is
approximately an inch in
diameter, has a rubbery
skin and is devoid of
white. When skinning and
cleaning snakes I often
encounter a female of the species con-
taining a clutch of eggs. These have
no shells, are the size of large marbles
and are extremely palatable.

“Bufo”: “Tripod” (B. 16/l/’35)
should watch the next pair of blue king-
fishers he comes across in the housekeep-
ing season, and he will see that they, as
well as Jack Kookaburra, have a power-
ful predilection for tree-ant nests as de-
sirable building sites. But Jacky quite
often picks the spout of a hollow branch
for his s.e., s.c. flat. Year before last,
one of my pals and his new missus aban-
doned a half-excavated ant-nest for a
spout, out of which they cleared a lot of
rubbish. It evidently suited them and
the kids, for they returned to it last
year and often use it as a sleeping place.
A while ago they dragged a dazed
mopoke out of it, using dreadful lan-
guage the while to the sleepy intruder,
so they clearly regard themselves *as
seised of an estate in fee simple—one
tree spout, to wit.
“Mug Gunner”: The hawk that dined
so messily at “S.G.’s” water-trough (B.
23/1 /’35) is popularly known as the
swamp hawk. A hefty fowl, its favorite
stamping-grounds are long-grassed plains
and croplands on which it derives a menu
of field mice, lizards, ground-nesting
birds and other small fry. A pair of
these birds will sometimes “sool a hare,
and puss has little better than an even-
money chance of escape, even with the
aid of a handy fence through which to
dodge.

“M.L.C.”: Touching that white wara-
tah discovered by “Lex L.” (B. 16/l/’35).
While not wishing to appear sceptical
(for the white waratah, though very rare,
has been established), it should be re-
membered that there is a white shrub
(Agastachys odor aid) sparsely sprinkled
through coastal bushland which is com-
monly mistaken for the waratah. Both
belong to the same order, and are very
similar in habit of growth, leaves and

flowers; the chief difference is that
the red fellow bears his flowers in a flat
head and the other has a more spiky
arrangement. I once, tramped miles to
inspect a white waratah on the Pieman
River (Tas.), but, as usual, it proved to
be an Agastachys.

“R. le W.”; The unusual spectacle of
an expensive marble tombstone, lavishly
inscribed, standing at the side of a lonely
bush track is to be witnessed near the
Shackle mine in the N.T. The legend
goes that in the days before motor trac-
tion reached the Territory a teamster,
with loaded waggon and a team of bul-
locks heading for Pine Creek from
Darwin, halted at the Shackle for liquid
refreshment. The brew must have been
good in those days, because, after ex-
hausting his ready cash, he traded in his
team for a further supply. The waggon
suffered a similar fate, and in due course
the cargo, but the tombstone he had on
board proved unsaleable, and was
dumped on the side of the road. It now
stands propped against a tree, an elo-
quent testimony to the potency of the
brew of our forebears. ,

“King Cyril”: Is big-pfeller Guv’-
ment doing the right thing by the wara-
tah? In the hills of Mittagong (N.S.W.),
where my old man used to spear goannas
time till the tram started strolling round
the adjacent landscape and pulling out
snakes invisible to his companion from
a variety of unlikely-looking places—just
for fun. The average townie can’t see
a snake until it moves ; bushmen, skilled
in their ways, can locate them by ear
as well as by eye.
* < * * *
“S.G.”: “Spare Walton” (B. 9/1/’35)
has a lot to learn about those water-
rats. Only a novice would leave his
catch lying upon the riverbank —it would
mean the end of the fish in most parts of
when I was a piccaninny, there
were waratahs by the twos and
threes and millions ; but now
the waratah —him finish. All
this is because we used to pull
off the flowers with long stalks
for spears or hair ornaments;
but the white pfeller doesn’t
pull the flowers, and the plant
dies. S’pose a bushfire come
and burn the flowers; that
pfeller all right. S’pose the
fire doesn’t; then the flowers must be
picked to save the plant and make him
jump-up more flowers next spring.
* * * *
“M.G.”: Unless the metropolis of the
Bridge City has been cleared up a lot of
recent years, Sydney’s snakes must pos-
sess more fecundity than Melbourne’s, or
the southern snakes must be exercising
birth control. David Fleay, curator of
the Australian section of Melbourne Zoo,
has been scouring Victoria for snakes,
and, after a week’s hard work, returned
with a paltry bag of a couple of hundred.
On the other hand, Fox, the Sydney
snake-charmer, who was later killed by
a krait in India, took a reporter from
one of the Sydney dailies down to La
Perouse one day. At La Perouse the
scribe could see nothing, but Fox’s
trained eyes led him to a row of rocks
a few yards from the tram terminus-
rocks used largely as seats by Sunday
picnickers —and, fixing his eye on a blade
of grass, shot out his arm and withdrew
a four-foot tiger. The bag which Fox
carried in his left hand was filled to the
brim with various ophidians within ten
minutes, and he spent the rest of the
Australia. The water-rat is as cunning
as he is voracious. I have had tethered
cod weighing several pounds apiece
picked clean during the night. The rat
will tackle anything which his instinct
tells him is in difficulties. I put a couple
of young cockatoos which I had retrieved
after a gale into a kerosene-tin “for
safety.” A handful of feathers was all
the rats left me.

“Gidya”: Where did “Lex L.” read
his information about the mistletoe-bird
(B. 26 /12/’34)? I can show him thou-
sands of square miles of country with no
mistletoe-birds or ironbark-trees where
every second tree along the rivers for
hundreds of miles is thick with mistle-
toe. The mistletoe fruit is sticky enough
to cling to a bird’s feathers, but it is
mainly propagated by birds that eat it.
* $ * * *
“Kotuku”: That par. (B. 2/l/’35)
about the thirsty drover and the ginger-
pop reminds me of an incident while 1
was footing it through Central Otago
(M.L.). I noticed an old swagman seated
by the roadside drinking with obvious
relish from a ginger-ale bottle. He in-
vited me to “have one.” As he* seemed
a trifle offended when I declined, I ven-
tured to try a sip. That “ginger ale” was
whisky, and powerful whisky at that.
So, as you can’t always tell the contents
of a bottle by its label, perhaps there’s
hope for the Riverina yet.
♦ * * *
“Barwon”: If “E.E.” (B. 16/l/’35) had
ever tasted milk from cows feeding on
wild mustard he would have searched for
a word other than “undrinkable” to de-
scribe it. The weed grows prolifically in
the central-west (N.S.W.) when the spring
is favorable, and puts milk and its deriva-
tives clean off the table while it remains
green. Milk left standing awhile throws
up a dense yellow cream which tastes
vile, and no profitable use can be made
of the butter. Bicarb, soda added to the
milk makes it just about sufficiently
palatable for the dogs to tackle. It even
taints the mutton of the ration sheep.
Strange to say, the plant, when chewed,
has a somewhat pleasant flavor, hard to
describe, but the milk—phew!

“Kwa”; Melville Islanders’ dazzling
smiles are due to the food they eat and
the way they cook it. In common with
all other blackfellows the islander’s diet
consists almost entirely of meat, and it is
invariably roasted in the ashes. Any
bushman knows that meat cooked in this
manner is often tough and leathery on
the outside and always coated with ashes
and cinders; Jacky never troubles to
scrape his toast before eating it, and the
charcoal naturally has a whitening effect
on the teeth. Many a young lubra has
come to my camp after lunching on roast
bandicoot or ’possum and flashed a smile
that would turn a film star green with
envy —and they are well aware of it.
THE LOST SHANTY.

The banroom door is open as it was in days
that rang when bushmen sang no

Ihe teamsters and the drovers when the inland
nieht came down , .
Would gather at the shanty, six days journey
And°tire<iand thirsty bladesmen when the weeks
With°kee 0 n d'digU would hail the sight of that
wide welcome door.
Ihey’ve closed the crossing shanty and the
shanty-keeper’s dead; . , ,
X h e ruin stands forsaken by the rivers sandy
The 'modern shearers pass it in their modern
motors fast, . ,
And chip at it with tawdry wit—that relic of the
past.
Tis said that in the moonlight, when the shape-
less shadows creep,
The shanty-keeper wakens from his never-ending
Andfghding to the bar-room door, with hospit-
able grin, ...
Uc takes his stand to wave a hand and beckon
bushmen in.
Bui now and then with creak of wheels and
clink of harness chain,
A canid team comes swaying down the inland
track again. .
And while the puncher’s dreaming oft enough
the leaders lag,
So he cracks his whip and takes a sip out ot
his waterbag.
And sometimes in the twilight weary stockmen
pass that way,
Old veterans of the inland living in a yesterday;
The shanty brings a memory of the good old
times long gone,
So they pause awhile to sigh and smile, and,
smiling, journey on.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
IF ’HOPPERS CAME TO THE CITIES.
‘J.R.D.”: If N. S. Wales had not ex-
perienced the best season for years, en-
abling it to stand up to the ’hopper
plague, the cities would have heard more
about it. In other States, where condi-
tions are not so good, especially in
Queensland, graziers have seen their last
bit of grass cleaned up, and are left to
contemplate their stock dying, with the
waterholes reduced to shrunken mud-
holes, the mercury well over the century
and no agistment available for hundreds
of miles. Queensland railways are one
long procession of stock trains.
The big stations—owned chiefly by
large pastoral companies—are trucking
their sheep to distant relief country. The
average grazier, still encumbered with the
hangover of years of drought and low
wool prices, can be saved only by rain.
In the meantime we hear of sheep carry-
ing seven months’ wool being sold for
Is. a head for skinning.
From the Flinders (N.Q.) to S. Aus.
come daily reports of further country
denuded by the pest.
The other day I met a chap in Pitt-
street, Sydney, who put all he had into
a small grazing property a year ago. He
smiled grimly at my query: “Holiday?”
“Not much! The ’hoppers have cleaned
up every blade of grass and lucerne on
the place. I couldn’t get agistment—
everyone’s in the same boat—so I had
to sell every hoof I owned for what they
would fetch.” When the air clears and
the grass begins to grow he will start
again, not where he left off, but further
back than a year ago. His actual losses
would be hard to state, and no one is
likely to hear of them —that is not
“news.” On leaving him I bought a news-
paper: half a column on the main page
featured the “daring robbery” of a few
shillings from a suburban till; another
with flaring headings about the birth of
a daughter to a sporting idol.
If the ’hopper swarms arrived in the
cities in force, clouds of them blotting
out the sun, cleaning up gardens and
lawns in their stride and leaving them as
bare as Bondi beach on a winter day,
would something drastic be done?
The personal message of one day of
’hoppers to a concentrated million
voters with only gardens at stake would
yield more and quicker results than their
present widespread attack.
LEAVE PINK-EYE ALONE.
“Tumbe Munda”: I had never had
pink-eye in my flock until one day an
afflicted stranger got in. The result
was that every sheep I possessed caught
the disease. At first I tried treating them
with various recommended remedies, but
the job became too big for me.
I tried kerosene: the signs of intense
pain shown by the sheep cured me of
that trick, but did not cure the sheep.
Some sheep were not' inconvenienced
greatly, as, getting the disease in one eye,
they would recover before the other eye
got bad. Eventually, the trouble cleared
up completely. Anyhow, why pester your
sheep with remedies and handling with a
disease, which lasts only two or three
weeks? I have never seen a sheep with
ulcers or abscess as a result of pink-eye.
When once a sheep has had the disease
it becomes immune for life.
PHOSPHORUS NEEDS OF SHEEP.
“Comeback”: The conclusions drawn
from the Dismal Swamp experiments of
“Jass” (B. 9/1 /’35) are misleading, as
several important factors were not taken
into consideration.
At Dismal Swamp part of the pastures
was green almost the year round. The
phosphate content of the soil i f the area
under test is admittedly low, but this has
little bearing on the subject, as the phos-
phate supply to animals through their
fodder depends entirely upon the state of
the pastures. While these remain green,
particularly under the conditions of low
stocking per acre, there should be suffi-
cient phosphorus in the plants to supply
the sheep. It is after the pasture plants
have dried up and shed their seed that
phosphate deficiency affects stock, and
at this time phosphatic lick is of great
value.
An examination of the bones of the
test sheep after six months’ grazing on
the area showed no signs of phosphate
deficiency, and obviously the phosphate
supplement was not needed.
In portions of W.A. where formerly
sheep could not be kept through the
summer without heavy mortality, they
are now maintained in good health with
the aid of phosphatic licks. The mor-
tality was occasioned almost entirely by
poisoning due to the chewing of bones,
carcasses of rabbits, etc., which con-
tained the organism parabotulinus.
Lack of protein is undoubtedly a fac-
tor in many cases of malnutrition, but
it is relatively unimportant as compared
with lack of calcium phosphate. This is
proven by the fact that a diet high in
protein and low in calcium phosphate
will not stop bone-chewing habits, while
access to phosphatic licks will quickly
cure the animals’ depraved tastes.
WET WOOL.
“Right Angle”; As “Dead Finish” (B.
12 /12 / ’34) states, the “feel” of wet wool
is quite distinct from the “condition” felt
when handling a newly-shorn fleece.
Damp wool differs, and at times it is
difficult to hold the scales fairly between
shearers who wish to declare wool wet
and owners who are anxious to get their
consignments on trucks.
Handling the wool is the best test, but
for this some have a natural instinct
which others never acquire.
Difference of opinion as to what really
constitutes wet wool has not changed in
aspect for 50 years.
From time to time, methods, mechani-
cal and otherwise, have been evolved to
solve the puzzle, but they have failed.
WHAT IS A STUD RAM WORTH?
“Lion”: At many sales recently I have
been struck by the absurdity of prices
realised for rams.
A buys good flock rams from a re-
liable stud, paying six guineas each. He
uses them a year, and then circumstances
require a clearing sale of sheep. The
rams’ credentials are read out, but they
only fetch ss. 6d. each. They were in
good order and condition when sold, and
running on similar country to where they
were bred.
If they are worth only ss. 6d. on A’s
property, why should they be worth six
guineas in the first place? This pheno-
menon is repeatedly in evidence. Proof
that Mr. A’s sheep were O.K. is in
the fact that he got Bs. Bd. for seven-
year-old ewes, with a few younger ones
in them.
It is evident, therefore (in my area,
the Riverina, anyway), that as soon as a
ram leaves the hands of its studmaster
and is depastured on a non-stud prop-
erty it loses at least 90 p.c, of its
original value, even though otherwise the
same.
This fact could be overcome as it was
in South Africa. Every stud beast there
had its S.A. studbook certificate of breed-
ing sold with it.
Consequently that animal, if properly
cared for, could depreciate in value only
according to its growing years and actual
condition.
Here one is virtually robbed of the
value paid for a ram by the act of tak-
ing delivery and depasturing it on a non-
stud property.
Stud-owners should be the first to re-
cognise this rotten system of value and
inequality, and for their own sakes should
alter if.
JETTING VERSUS CRUTCHING.
“Right Angle”: It is said that the
N.S.W. Government tests at Trangie and
at private stations prove a calcium
arsenate mixture gave better results than
the usual arsenate of soda or arsenical
powder dip mixture.
There is, however, a large number of
sheepmen who do not hold with jetting.
They claim better and more extended
protection by the old method of crutch-
ing the sheep well and swabbing.
Apart from the messiness of jetting and
the probability of sheep being insuffi-
ciently jetted when in the race, or even
missed altogether, the sheep will prob-
ably require to be yarded again in a few
weeks.
Properly crutched, a sheep should, in
ordinary health, go for a couple of
months without further attention.* Also,
every sheep is well handled in the shed,
and crutched under close supervision. It
is practically impossible to miss a sheep.
It is awkward at times to crutch ewes
heavy in lamb, but a good board of
crutchers may be depended upon not to
knock them about. Sheep, especially
ewes and hoggets, will always do better
when relieved of a stained and sour
breech.

STOMACH BACTERIA.
“Stump Jump”: “Bates” (B. 2/1/’35)
must stand corrected about stomach bac-
teria. They aid digestion very little, but
that is not their function. Digestive
juices resolve the crude proteins of the
raw feed into their amino-acids. The bac-
teria build up the peculiar but necessary
proteins for the animal out of the state
of flux brought about by the juices. The
influence of stomach bacteria is but
newly appreciated in dietetics. Only
general principles yet are known.
A feature of bacterial action appli ed
to protein for woolgrowing is its Sf
dence on the sulphur content of the C'

DEHORNING MUST COME.
“Beefo”: Admirers of the “horns !ik-
slip-rails type of beef cattle must lot
all their rooted objections to polled breed,
if they are to take full advantage of
the chilled-beef trade. Bruising ofcattJ

duced to a minimum. U.S.A. exports no

got to fall into line. ' neVL
A decade or so ago a Brisbane meat
co. used to pay a bonus for polls as is
done m most exporting countries, but the
collapse of beef prices brought about
the stoppage of the allowance.
“M.W.”: “Rich. J.” (B. 26/ 12/’34j
raises a point which is often over-
looked—the “tyrant” in mobs of cattle
Extensive trials in other parts of the
world have shown that all'or none of
the cattle in a mob must be dehorned
for even a “quiet” beast with horns be-
comes a bully among the hornless.
As adult animals often suffer a severe
setback after dehorning it is advisable
to do it early. It is best done on calves
in the first week after birth when they
are yarded.
A certain method of stopping horn
growth is to cauterise with caustic
potash stick. If the hair round the horn
bud is removed and a piece of wood
with a hole bored in it is placed over
the bud, it can be rubbed with potash
without fear of blistering the skin. It
is advisable to moisten the bud first.
Usually two or three applications—time
five minutes—are enough. The first sign
of blood indicates that the operation is
complete. No pain is involved unless
through carelessness the caustic potash
spreads to the surrounding skin.
The advantages accruing from dehorn
ing are: (1) Cattle are more tractable. (2)
They make more economical gains. (3)
More can be transported in a truck. (4)
They suffer less in travel. (5) They bring
a higher price.
WHEAT IN N. S. WALES.
“Sorghum”: A summary of the 15
field-wheat competitions held in Parkes
(N.S.W.) recently illustrates relative popu-
larities of different wheat varieties and
the changes in manurial and cultural
practice.
Farmers are realising that superphos-
phate is more necessary in low-price
years, when every bushel over working
expenses counts, than in high-price
periods. Apart from output, however,
liberal manuring, by promoting early
maturity, helps considerably the gluten
quality. Of the 124 crops entered, 91
p.c. were treated with super. Since 1930
the average has been about 79 p.c.
Of the 17 varieties competing Ford
proved most popular, with Nabawa a
close second. The latter, however,
showed a decrease in popularity of 50
p.c. compared with 1932. Bobin, Can-
berra and Waratah have all declined in
favor during the past five years, while
Dundee, with a 3 p.c. popularity last
year, made an imposing showing of 20
p.c. In the latter case, good, pure seed-
wheat was sought after, and the results
have certainly been justified.
Consistent cultivation has also proved
its worth ; only 6 p.c. of the entries were
stubble grown, while the rest showed an
average working of 4.2,

THE SUPERPHOSPHATE BOUNTY.
“Doitnow”: The bounty on super, for
top-dressing purposes is being granted
again until July of this year.
The value of this cannot be too
strongly stressed. It improves the pas-
tures, also the health, stamina and quicx-
growing powers of all classes of stock
depastured on top-dressed country.
We had some rigidly-culled lambs
which were wormy crossbreds, being the
5 p.c. rejection from 1000-odd drop.
These were drenched and put on to top-
dressed paddocks four months ago. They
fetched 18s. Id. in Homebush last week,
and could not be recognised as the same
sheep we drenched four months ago.
The cash price of super, here is £4 Is.
per ton, less 15s. per ton bounty. Further
remarks should be superfluous.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Titoki”; To quickly clear cow-pox try
4oz. Epsom salt in a whisky-bottle of
water, and apply a little of the liquid to
the affected teat after each milking.
“Dead Finish”: Select a waterbag
made from thinnish canvas. The bag
which shows water on the outside will
cool quicker than one made from a
closely-woven, more expensive canvas
which is always dry on the outside.
“Gumblegubbin”: Always measure
each pair of trace-chains before using
them. Many a sore is caused through
one chain being a little longer than the
other, thus throwing the weight on the
point of one shoulder.
“Kara way”: An effective mixture
used outback for keeping flies away from
the eyes of working horses is an ounce
of pennyroyal well stirred into a pint of
olive or rape oil. Applied with a rag,
it affords immunity all day or longer,
and is harmless to the moke.
“Whalebone”; To avoid catching sheep
in rabbit-traps in “open sets” place a
bendy stick over the trap.
“Pick”: When fencing across a rock
field too hard for post-holding, mortise
the posts into placed slabs of timber, and
stay them firmly with mitred struts. In-
stead of trenching, bend 6in. of netting
outwards along the rock surface and
weight it with a tier of stones.
“Lion”: If loose-hay stacks are cov-
ered with foot-netting instead of wire
they will resist wind and rain much
better, and the hay will not “pipe” so
easily. The netting should have a heavy
stick fastened to each end, and can be
used for years.
“Murrawong”; It is worth while veri-
fying the weight of your wool packs each
year. Unless the grower notifies his
broker to the contrary, the standard
weight of 11 lib. per pack is deducted as
tare, and, as weights are taken to the
nearest pound, odd bales and single bale
lots are reckoned at 121 b. Don’t weigh
packs singly ; put four, six or any even
number, including caps. I struck a flimsy
line of packs this season which averaged
only 10|lb. We lost a little wool weight
on them, but not so much as if correct
tare had not been catalogued.
“Billy See”: When the leather clack
of the pump fails to hold water, first
see that the inner face of the leather is
downwards. Then pare away hinge part
slightly, so as to make more flexible.
Finally, give working face a good coal-
ing of stiff tallow.
“The 0.D.”: A wet year like the
present results in a prevalence of lumpy
wool (mycotic dermatitis), due to mois-
ture promoting the growth of an infec-
tious fungus. Many dips have been tried,
but none satisfactorily. If lumpy wool
appears, shear the affected sheep at once
and segregate until the condition dis-
appears, as it will if they are kept dry.
“H.”: When taking dents out of tank
or other fully closed floats of soft
material, don’t punch holes. Solder a
strip of metal to the deepest part of the
dent and pull out. Then remove the
strip and clean off with a soldering-iron.
“Harrami”; A serviceable gate can be
made by joining two pieces of round
timber uprights by another piece mor-
tised from bottom of one to midway
up the other. Then stretch bracing wires
between uprights and through diagonal.
Erect on block and loop hinge.
“Bogantungan”: A good lamb’s tail or
blowfly dressing can be made of one,
three and six parts respectively of crude
carbolic acid, power kerosene and tal-
low. Keep warm when using. Horse oil
is better than tallow, but is not always
handy.
“Karaway”; Small dams or excavated
tanks in the cow paddocks should be well
shaded. Cattle want cool water in
summer —and they drink less than when
the water is sun-warmed. Willow-trees
make good shade, while their matted
roots bind the banks. One side of the
reservoir should be fenced off and planted
with reed-grass and water-lilies to keep
the water wholesome. Finally, introduce
a few small fish, which prevent the dam
breeding mosquitoes and help in aerating.
“M.H.”: When pumping water into
an adjacent tank with the engine, run
a piece of insulated wire from the top of
the spark plug over the top into the tank,
leaving the end at a point to which you
require the tank filled. When the water
touches the wire, the current is earthed
and the engine stops.
“Catchpenny”: With all due respect to
“G.G.” (B. 16 /1 / ’35) I have never seen
the cattle beast yet that would touch a
milk thistle as fodder. Horses and pigs
love ’em, but Strawberry turns up a dis-
dainful nose.
“S.G.”: An interesting result of the
recent rains in the n.-w. of N. S. Wales
is the luxurious growth of grass on the
galvanised burr. In some quarters, previ-
ously badly infested, the grass has smoth-
ered the burr, and appears to be holding
its own. Too much rain does not agree
with the curse. On the loose, black-
soil plains its grip is precarious at any
time, roly-poly, on the other hand, thriv-
ing on this class ol country Wh
the burr appears to do best is on rid?
well-drained or droughty areas
“Ricbex”: The best device r Ve
for rendering a haystack mouse-nrS
was used this season at
(N.S.W.) The owner built a galvan
iron wall round the stack, placing th.
sheets lengthwise, overlapping them 3 n
and sinking them 6in. in the ground 0
the inside, he’d leaned sticks from the
top of the wall to the ground. He ey
plained that no outside rodents could
get in—they can’t climb galvanised iron
Any that were inside had to come out
(via the sticks) for water. He told me
he got the idea from an old Bulletin
If so, for the sake of those who may
have missed it, it seems worth repeating.
“Narooma”: The local woolbuyer
offered us 3d. per lb. all round for our
crutchings. We could not see eye to eye
with him—the wool was fine and free—
so we forwarded the lot for reclassing
to a city firm. It worked them into
three lines, which were sold under our
brand. Prices: 20 p.c. at 10|d., 25 p.c.
at 84d. and the balance at 6|d. per lb.
Who said there was no money in country
woolbuying?
“Wen”: Sheep-drovers’ latest enemy
is blue couch grass. Many losses in the
Moree (N.S.W.) district, thought to be
due to grasshopper baits, have now been
traced to blue couch. The losses were
mainly on the Moree-Biniguy route. It
was found that the couch gave a strong
positive reaction when tested for prussic
acid. Drovers have been given the tip to
keep their woolly charges moving when
they see this grass, which is right across
the stock route.

WERE YOU BORN IN FEBRUARY?
Statistics show that there are fewer
babies born in February than in any
other month, and fewer born on Feb. 29
than on any other day of the year.
Whether Aquarius or Pisces is to blame
for this it is hard to say, but apparently
there is something wrong somewhere.
February babies are most unfortunate
infants. Nothing ever happens in Feb-
ruary. There are no centenaries, no
public holidays, no elections, and very
few race-meetings, and the last couple of
days are missing altogether. I have only
known one February baby who was at
all lucky, and she was born very early
oa the first of the month, and as the
clocks were all fast it has always been
suspected that she was really a January
baby sailing under false colors.
February babies are mostly either male
or female, but there is no guarantee given
with them. The hair of the males is
at first either dark or fair, and later in
life it becomes grey or white. That of
the females is also dark or fair to begin
with, and its later shades depend upon
the fancy and taste of the owner.
February babies are fond of beer and
prawns, but they shouldn’t be allowed to
indulge these tastes until at least March
or April.

CHANCE FOR INVENTORS.
Inventors have turned their genius to
many overcrowded fields, but have
neglected the virgin one of literature.
Yet this domain offers vast possibilities.
For instance, an automatic metre-ad-
juster would be welcome to poetasters,
and an inspiration self-starter would
appeal to literary aspirants generally.
A right-word machine would supply a
long-felt want, and the same applies to
a press-the-button-for-correct-gramma»-
contrivance. A correct-punctuation scar-
terer is another desideratum, as is also
a paragraphing appliance.
A loose-narrative-threads-gathered-up-
and-neatly-climaxed device would be a
boon, as would also an obscure-meaning
clarifier, while a fresh-treatment-supplier
or an original-plot-mixer would savor of
heaven.
Editors would gladly combine to put
any or all of these on the market, and
for their health’s sake would probably
buy them up for free distribution as fast
as produced.

THE STOIC.
After many sleepless nights Bloggs
decided the tooth must come out. Maria,
his placid wife, agreed.
In the dentist’s waiting-room Bloggs
looked benignly around. Several people
were waiting and all wearing expressions
reminding him of a picture he had once
seen depicting Inquisition victims under-
going the latest in thumbscrew culture.
Their tragic looks brought out the
irrepressible humorist in Bloggs. Con-
fronted by a serious ordeal, some people
are like that. But his jokes were greeted
in stony silence. It puzzled Bloggs.
Himself a stoic, he wondered at the
weakness of others. After all, what did
it amount to? The needle—a pinprick!
Then the forceps, a quick twist, a
wrench and then —out. Pouff! Just like
that.
The surgery door opened.
“Bloggs?” questioned the nurse.
Bloggs turned to his wife. “Buck up,
dear,” he said. “It’ll all be over in a
second. I’ll wait here for you.”

XX.— THE DETECTIVE.
When the Chief of Police gets a difficult
case
He sends for the Famous Detective,
Who with instinct unerring can point out
the place
Where the criminal’s plans are de-
fective.
He proceeds with efficiency, verve and
elan
To the glorious climax of “Handcuff
that man!”
“Magnificent, Holmes! I’d never have
guessed it.”
“Element’ry, dear Watson. The scoundrel
confessed it.”
Contrary to general belief the detec-
tive business is not overcrowded. It is
too difficult to find men with suitable
names. Gerald Fortescue may be all very
well for the diplomatic service, the navy
or the stage, but as the name of a
famous detective it is unthinkable. It is
too much like a name. Detectives’
names mustn’t sound like names at all,
unless it is the name of someone’s break-
fast food or weed-killer.
Sherlock Holmes and Sexton Blake are
cases in point. Either of these names
would do for a
cocktail or a new
color in dress
material, but we
can hardly im-
agine them as be-
longing to a little
boy prattling at
his mother’s knee
or doing any of
the childish
things Gerald
would do.
Apart from his
name, the most
valuable asset a
detective pos-
sesses is his in-
tuition —in other
words, his power
of guessing. The
second is his
power of deduc-
tion, which is in-
tuition (or guess-
ing) plus luck.
To these two
faculties he must
add a colossal
general know-
ledge. He must
be familiar with
all strange East-
ern poisons, the
passwords and
history of every
secret society in
Europe, Asia and Bogabilla, and must
be able to distinguish between a
murder and a suicide at a single
glance. When he is confronted sud-
denly with a corpse with a peculiar-
shaped knife-wound three inches below
the left shoulder blade, he should be able
to recognise it at once as the work of
none other than Nevada Ned, last heard
of in Spring Cart Gully early in 1905.
Disguise and make-up must come as
second nature to him. It is essential, for
instance, that Flash Claude, the kingpin
of the drug traffic, shall not have the
slightest suspicion that the undersized,
one-legged hunchback who asks him for
a match in a low dive in Darlinghurst is
identical with the cultured six-foot waiter
who pocketed his tip at the Australia
half an hour previously, and that both
are Hambone Walks, the celebrated
sleuth.
It is desirable, though not absolutely
necessary, for him to have a boneheaded
friend who is even denser than the aver-
age man in the street, and who will make
boneheaded suggestions when things are
particularly diffi-
cult, and thus en-
able the detective
to stumble on the
solution. It is much
easier to stumble
on solutions than
to arrive at them by
any other means.
A d e t e ct i v e’s
most interesting
cases nearly always
occur when, worn
out by months of
labor, he goes
away for a well-
earned holiday. If
a detective arrives
at a quiet country
hotel it is a pretty
safe bet that there’l!
be a murder there
almost straightway.
His presence seems
a challenge that
evildoers simply
can’t resist. If his
boneheaded friend
is with him (and
he’s almost bound
to be) then the
thing is an abso-
lute certainty. It
is also a pretty
sure thing that it
will take him the
full length of his vacation to clear up
the crime.
Then: “Oh, well,” he remarks laugh-
ingly to Bonehead as they leave the hotel;
“now we’ll get back to the city for a
quiet rest.”
They reach their lodgings and find
waiting on the doorstep a hysterical
woman whose husband has been kid-
napped by a mysterious Chinese. Ten
minutes later the detective, heavily dis -
guiserk is eating chop-suey in Campbell-
street.
Another mystery is well on the way to
solution.

In a North Coast (N.S.W.) cricket match a
player took five wickets with the , last five
halls of an over. Is this a record? —5378.
No. The greatest number of wickets obtained
by a bowler with successive deliveries is nine,
by Paul Hugo, left hand, in a school game in
South Africa, for Smithlield v. Aliwal North,
in February, 1931. Eight have been taken
three times —by James Walker for Ashcombe
Park v. Tunstall, at Ashcombe Park, near Leek
(Staffordshire), in 1882; by Janies Stebbing for
Frindsbury v. Rainham, in Kent, 1902; and by
Private J. Leake, for 9th Brigade Canadian
Expeditionary Force v. Canadian Army Service
Corps, in France, August, 1917. Leake bowled
down all the 10 wickets in 12.balls. There
are numerous instances of six wickets having
been taken with six balls and five-wickets with
five balls.
(f) How old is Jack Carroll, andhow long
has be been boxing ? (2) From whom and
when did he first win the Australian welter-
weight championship ? (3) Who beat, him for
it ? (4) Whom did Carroll defeat when he re-
gained the title ? —5379.
(1) Carroll was born on February 3, 1907,
and has been boxing 11 years. (2) A1 Burke, on
March 31, 1928. (3) Charlie Purdy became
recognised as the champion ■ when Carroll

(1) Brief particulars of the military career of
Baron von Richthofen ? (2) By whom was he
killed ? (3) What became of his ’plane ? —5340.
(1) Formerly in the cavalry, he first came
into prominence in February, 1917, when, as
a lieutenant in the German Air Force, he was
credited with 20 aerial victories. He was
promoted to command of the 11th Chasing
Squadron with the rank of captain, and for
further exploits received the order of the Red
Eagle with crown and swords. He was shot
down behind the British lines on April 21,
1918, and buried with full military honors. (2)
There has been much controversy as to who
was responsible for his death. One account
states that he was brought down by the Can-
adian pilot Capt. Roy Brown; another, more
credible, is that he was shot from the ground by
an Australian Lewis gun. (3) Not on record.

(1) Derris root can be obtained through any
chemist, or from Elliott Bros., Sydney (2)
One part of the root to 100 parts of a soapy
solution used to bath the dog is recommended.
This will not only kill all ticks that may be
on the dog, but will poison all ticks that may
get on the animal for the next four days. A
bath in the solution every sixth day will
prevent tick paralysis.
/ have a tree- and also a sword-fern which
nave been attacked by a disease which appears
on the underside of the leaf as small yellow
spots, and later develops into brown circular
formations a little larger than a pin’s head.
Cause and means of prevention ? —5036.
There is no disease. The spots are spores,
the reproductive organisms of the ferns, which
carry on the function of reproduction as do
seeds in flowering plants.
My Thunbergia gibsoni flowers freely, but
I have not found any seed; how can l propa-
gate them ? —5410.
Layer the lower branches in pots of sandy
ioam. They will strike at the joints in about
three weeks. This climber carries about one
seed-pod in a hundred blooms, recognisable
by the pointed end protruding from the end
ol the dead flower.
Can rose plants be raised from the big pods
left after flowering? If so. how ? —5398.
It is a horticultural gamble from which you
may get anew variety. Roses are hybridised
by transferring the pollen from the anthers of
one kind to the stigma of another. A small
bush should be used for the work. Then cover
the flowers with fine cheesecloth to keep bees
and insects from them. Leave the pods until
they have thoroughly dried, after which sow
the seed in boxes or pots of rich soil well
lightened with sand, and cover with glass.
(1) My Kentia palms are covered with white
spots, and leaves are turning yellow. What can
he done ? (2) My potted ferns wither and die
in from six to nine months. They are in a
glass conservatory, and watered three limes
weekly. Cause and remedy ? —5345.
(1) Remove affected leaves and paint the
balance with boiled starch (made very thin).
Do not water the leaves for at least a week,
then give a good drenching, and finally spray
with weak Black Leaf 40. (2) Causes probably
worms or aphis. Soak the pots in water con-
taining a quantity of lime: this will shift the
worms. Another cause for ferns dying is that
there are holes in the soil (left when potting),
and the moisture rushes away without aiding
the roots. Press the soil firmly at the top,
pushing it to the sides of the pots, and then
give a thorough soaking. In very bad cases
it is advisable to repot the ferns.
How did auction sales originate? —sl63.
Earliest known examples of auctions were
in Babylon, where it was the annual custom
in the villages to thus dispose of maidens for
marriage. Among the Romans military booty
and captives in war were sold by auction,
and after the murder of Pertinax the Prae-
torians spld the imperial title by public auction
to the highest bidder, Julian. In some places
in'England it has been usual to set up an inch

cigarette-lighters ? —5271.
The original pyrophoric alloy (ferro-cerium)
manufactured by Welsbach contains nearly 40
per cent, iron, while the competing products
have only about 15 per cent, iron, and for
the purpose of hardening about 2 per cent,
antimony or bismuth is added. To produce
a low-melting and smooth-casting pyrophoric
alloy, certain manufacturers add about 5 per-
cent. copper. Most manufacturers produce
terro-cenum by the electrolysis of the anhydrous
chlorides of cerium, lanthanum or didyraium.

(1) “Memoirs of Francois Peron” (Paris,
1824); “Vergleichende Darstellung der Pflan-
zengeographie der Subantarktischen Inseln,”
2 vols. (Jena, 1905); “St. Paul and Amster-
dam,” by C. Velain; and “Annales de Geo-
graphic,” Vol. 2, p. 329. (2) The island is a
nearly extinct volcano, rising to 3000 ft. above
sea-level. Area, 25 square miles. (3) Exposed
to west winds and shrouded in mists. (4)
Authorities differ. One says: “Vegetation-
mosses and lichens”; the other: “abundant
vegetation.” (5) Innumerable seabirds, seals
and fish. (6) Fishermen and sealers from Re-
union operate there. Otherwise there are no
inhabitants. (7) Some hundreds of miles north
of the island.
(1) Formula for a mixture to be used in the
prevention of fogging of windscreens or
windows ? (2) I have the remains of an Eng-
lish composition which seems to contain whiting
and glycerine and which is very good. Where
could I have it analysed ? —5145.
(1) Glycerine alone is very good. If a little
whiting is added it acts as a slight abrading
medium and cleans as well as polishes. An-
other good mixture is made by dissolving 2oz.
glycerine in 1 quart of 62 p.c. alcohol, with
a few drops of oil of amber: methylated spirit
could be used. (2) At the Technological
Museum, Harris-street, Ultimo, Sydney. Com-
municate with the curator.

—5236.
Mix Ti parts by weight of whiting, 4 part
drier, and 1 part boiled linseed oil; thin to
the right consistency with benzine or petrol,
then make black by the addition of lampblack
or logwood extract. Apply the polish, and
when dry rub down with sandpaper and polish
again. If a very high lustre is wanted, rub
down again and give a coating of shellac dis-
solved in spirit; dry, sandpaper and treat again
with shellac in the manner of French polishing.

lites discovered yet.
Is an old silver coin, picked up in the Roman
Amphitheatre at Frejus, dated 1321, of any
value ? (Rubbings sent.). —5213.
It is a contemporary coin of Morocco

the Mohammedan calendar, which starts from
the Hegira (a.d. 622). The value of specimen,
as per rubbing, is about 9d.

What is termed the revolution of 1868 over-
threw the power of the shoguns (military chiefs,
who, though they owned allegiance to the
mikado or emperor, were the actual rulers)

that the treaties with foreigners, which com-
menced in 1854 when the U.S.A. secured trading

murder and rape. He praised the Scout
movement for its softening influence on
naughty boys; but what sort of a place
must Lahore be to live in? Chicago

beaches, where they are used as dressing-
sheds. One Benjamin Beale invented it
in 1734. Within a few years adventurous
spirits (who nowadays would be learning
to fly, exploring fever-ridden jungles or
climbing the Matterhorn) were being
wheeled out from the shore in Mr.
Beale’s contraptions, from which they
descended by a ladder for a splash in
four feet of calm water. George 111. was
the first king to sea-bathe regularly. His
bathing-box, emblazoned with the royal
arms, was such a solidly-built structure
that it was still in use in 1914. It is now
a toolshed.

“H.A.”: “S. M. Herald,” discussing
proposals for lengthening the lives of
Australian Parliaments, points out that
“in the Victorian era the life of the
British Parliament was seven years.” But
even when the Septennial Act was still
in operation in Victoria’s time no Parlia-
ment ever ran its full course. The long-
est-lived of the lot was Palmerston’s (’59
to ’65), and that only lasted a couple of
months or so over the six. Even by that
time an unwritten law had superseded the
written one ; seven years had come to
mean six, or at the most a trifle over.
The Salisbury-Balfour Ministry (’95 to
’O2) certainly broke the convention, but
the Boer War furnished the excuse for
that, and in any case it finished after the
Victorian era. The Great War prolonged
the life of a Parliament even beyond
seven years. But nowadays in Britain five
means five, and seldom less if the Gov-
ernment retains a majority.

AUTOMATIC TRAFFIC CONTROL.
HOW ROBOT POLICE HANDLE THE JOB.
BY FRED BERRY.
HPRAFFIC problems, particularly those brought about by
congestion in cities and busy towns, have for a long time
been a subject of grave concern to motorists and to those in
authority who administer the various acts and regulations.
Statistics show plainly that by far the greatest proportion
of street accidents occurs at intersections. Since the inception of
motoring it has been the custom to train special traffic police
whose sole duty it is to regulate traffic at crossings in cities and
some of our larger towns, but there are many reasons why this
practice cannot be further extended.
Obviously, could traffic police be
stationed at every busy crossing in the
Commonwealth, road fatalities would
decrease, but the cost would be pro-
hibitive. With the rapid increase in
traffic, however, some satisfactory scheme
of control must be evolved, and to be
successful it must
be cheap to main-
tain and effective
in operation.
In America auto-
matic traffic sig-
nals, operated elec-
trically, have been
installed for many
years, and, al-
though in certain
States the “robot
police” were un-
favorably received,
modification and
improved design
have eliminated
earlier faults, and
the scheme is now
the backbone of
traffic control in
most major cities.
T rafalgar-square
Control.
In England, as
would be expected,
any newfangled idea such as automatic
traffic signals undoubtedly met with a
cold reception, and the powers that be
watched cannily whilst other countries
experimented before making a definite
move. However, once convinced, the
“hubs of the traffic universe,” Picca-
dilly Circus and Trafalgar-square, were
both equipped with automatic traffic con-
trol.
So far as Australian motorists are con-
cerned, their experiences of “robot
Car wheel passing over detector strip,
transmitting electrical impulse to control
mechanism. The brain in the control-
box decides road speed, and so organises
traffic signals.
police” have been confined to Melbourne
and Sydney, but as the innovation has
proved thoroughly successful other capi-
tals are now to follow suit, while ex-
tensions are being carried out in both
the senior cities.
As the majority of drivers will at no
distant date have to obey automatic
signals instead of the familiar and at
times petulant “cop,” an explanation of
the working of these devices is timely.
How vehicle-controlled automatic traffic signals are operated
at intersections. Note in this case how cars are passed
through in order of their arrival over the detector strip.
With automatic traffic control the motor-
ist no longer looks for direction from
police at central points, but from a
group of colored lights housed in towers
or pedestals located at each of the four
corners of an intersection. This group
consists of three circular lamps, about
Sin. in diameter, one above the other ;
the top lamp, red, signals “Stop, and
wait behind stop line drawn on the road-
way.” The middle lamp, amber, flashed
on while red is still showing, requires
the driver still to stop, but to be ready
to go when green shows. The green
lamp, at the bottom, flashes “Road clear
—go.”
What Drivers Must Learn.
When making turns, green and red
must be regarded as the conventional
go and stop signals given by traffic police,
and in turning right one must proceed
only to the further side of the green light
and there pause till the green appears
on the cross-road indicator.
Amber alone means to traffic in the
intersection “If going straight on proceed
with caution until the intersection is
cleared. If turning left proceed with due
regard to safety of pedestrians crossing.
If turning right proceed, but only it
approaching traffic permits the turn to
be completed before red shows.”
So much for the import of the colored
lights. The methods of operation are ex-
tremely ingenious, and in some types
almost human in effect. Broadly the
principles are divided into two classes;
(1) Those wherein each road is allo-
cated so many seconds for traffic to pass
in each direction, and (2) those wherein
the time factor is governed by the flow
of traffic at any particular time.
Vehicle Control.
The latter type, which appears to have
a number of advantages over those using
the fixed-time cycle at an intersection of
two roads, has three main components:
(1) The detector, (2) the controller, (3)
the signal-lantern groups.
The detector is a contact-making de-
vice consisting of two spring-steel plates,
lying parallel and spaced about one-
eighth inch apart, moulded into a rubber
envelope and let into the roadway in a
shallow trough at right-angles to the kerb,
extending half-way across the roadway
and located approximately 30 yards from
the intersection —depending, of course,
upon grade and probable speed of traffic.
Cables from this detector pad lead to the
controller—the brains of the system.
The controller, located on the pave-
ment, resembles a square pillar-box. It
contains an elaborate assembly of relays,
solenoids, a set of circuit-changing
springs actuated by camshaft control,
condensers, resistances, neon gas tubes
and a standard radio rectifying valve.
This ingenious apparatus collects the
various electrical impulses from the de-
tector strips and performs the duties of
a policeman. The inner unit is a simple
mechanism which automatically performs
the necessary switching operations to
the signals in accordance with the elec-
trical impulses received from the several
detectors. Switching is accomplished by
the step-by-step action of a camshaft
which closes a group of electrical con-
tacts in six different combinations in suc-
cession. The stopping action is con-
trolled by four relays and two timing
circuits.
A number of separate adjustments are
provided which enable the controller to
be easily and quickly adapted to the re-
quirements of the traffic which might be
passing the particular intersection under
notice. At the top of the unit is fitted a
“facility switch,” whereby any of the six
following systems of control may be
applied: (1) All signal lights off. (2) Sig-
nals automatic. (3) Automatic control,
amber light on, time switch on. (4)
Inner compartment of control-box—the
electrical brain which decides the
sequence of traffic.
Amber light only. (5) Manual (emer-
gency) control. (6) All signals red.
Emergency Operation.
Although manual control may seem
out of place in a scheme of automatic
control it must be remembered that dur-
mg processions or on special occasions
one-track traffic is essential ; conse
quently a push-button enables the traffic
officer to leave one road open for anv
convenient time.
On the front panel of the inner unit
nine adjustable switches are located i n
order to cope with every conceivable

gear operate a series of spring contacts,
which in turn cause the signal lamps to

type of traffic stream at an intersection.
Eight of these switches are associated
with the two intersecting roads, whilst
the ninth, known as the periodic call
timing switch, affords facilities for auto-
matically interrupting a continuous traffic
stream on either road at the expiration
of a suitable period for the particular
benefit of pedestrians. Four “on” and
“off” switches are also provided, one pair
controlling the revision of right of way
to either road, according to circum-
stances —see (5) —whilst the other pair
enable the amber extension to be
switched on and off as desired.
The Robot Policeman.
The functions of these various switches
are as follows:
(1) Maximum timing switches which
determine the period during which con-
tinuous traffic upon one road can keep
any vehicle waiting on another.
(2) Amber timing switches to adjust
the duration of the amber warning in
accordance with the requirements of
traffic at the intersection. Actually, the
amber light can either make or mar
any automatic traffic control, for if a
road loses its right of way by virtue ol
a gap in traffic but a short amber period
is required, as it only affects stationary
vehicles on the cross-road. On the other
hand, where a continuous flow has to
be interrupted a longer amber interval
is necessary in order that vehicles which
have passed the stop line may get clear
of the intersection. Consequently, the
amber or caution period is governed by
the traffic stream at any particular time.
(3) The “vehicle interval” timing
switches determine the safe-passage
period allowed to each vehicle to move
from the detector strip to the far side
of intersection, each vehicle as it crosses
securing its own particular safety mtei-
val. Here again the robot contro

Though it is possible to control any
traffic intersection by the methods
enumerated, in practice the more usual
nrinciples of operation are as follows:

initiated by vehicles passing over the re-
spective detector strips. First, lake the
case of a car approaching a crossing
with green showing and no other
vehicle in the vicinity. The driver car-
ries on, his car passes the detector strip
and, while no visible change occurs, the
control unit ensures ample time for a
safe crossing. Furthermore, the time in-
terval secured by the passage of a slow
vehicle will be given a longer right of
way than a fast touring car. This is
one of the vital features of latest
robot control in that it proportions
the right-of-way periods according to
actual traffic requirements and almost
totally eliminates waiting time.
Now consider the case of a car
approaching the crossing with signal light
red, but no other traffic in the vicinity.
When the car passes over the detector
strip the signal will almost at once
change to amber and, given a reasonable
speed of approach, green will appear
by the time the intersection has been
reached, so that the driver can proceed
without decelerating or pulling up.
No Hesitation.
In the case of two cars approaching a
cross-street together, the first to pass
over the detector will have the right of
way, but the passage of the second
vehicle is “remembered” and “Go” will
be given shortly after the first car has
made the crossing.
Considering now the case of an in-
tensely busy traffic stream, it may
rightly be suspected
that each closely-
packed car will ex-
tend the right of way
in crossing until the
time overlap may
conceivably continue
indefinitely. As soon,
however, as the de-
tector strip indicates
a vehicle on a cross-
road a “go” signal
will be given it at
the first available
gap ; but when, as
so often happens,
these gaps are few
and far between, the
controller takes the law unto itself and,
after a predetermined interval of one-way
traffic, the busy stream is halted and side
traffic let through. In effect the secret of
any vehicle-actuated automatic traffic
control is that in no case does one line
of traffic secure a monopoly over the
other. Waiting traffic is always passed
through the first available gap or at the
end of a predetermined interval ; conse-
quently each road secures the right of
way in direct ratio to its traffic density,
and should drivers smartly and re-
ligiously obey the various signals delays
and inconvenience must be reduced to
a minimum.
Cheap-battery Pitfalls.
In buying for the car too few motor-
ists realise that the best is usually the
cheapest in the long run. In these days
when so much cheap and nasty stuff is
invading the motor-accessories market
one would be well advised to investigate
the origin of anything quoted at lower
than ruling rates.
Particularly is this applicable to bat-
teries, a vital part of the car, and one
that must be maintained in good order.
Not many motorists are conversant with
electrical fittings, and they are therefore
liable to be impressed by glib statements
regarding number of plates and offers of
unconditional guarantees.
The number of plates in a battery is
of some importance, but what counts for
a lot more is the capacity of the cells to
stand up for long periods to extremely
hard work. The buyer should assure
himself concerning the battery’s ampere-
hour rating on 20-minule, 20-hour and
100-hour tests ; find out if the negative
and positive plates have been scienti-
fically built, and are of the requisite
thickness, and whether the insulation is
up to accepted standards.
Inspection won’t tell everything. Cases
have been known where dealers bought
old containers and stocks of reject plates:
used cardboard or untreated wood as
separators; repainted the casings, and
under fancy names sold them at a low
figure to uncritical customers. In such
circumstances, even though a guarantee
is given, the motorist finishes up by pay-
ing through the nose for service. If he
is wise he resolves in future to buy a
standard battery from a reputable dealer,
paying the full price.
Motor Oddities.
“Shiggs”: The first motor-car seen in
Bathurst was a Ford belonging to R. G.
Edgell. It was earlier than Model T and
worked by steam. Soon afterwards two
local medicoes. Dr. Machattie and Dr.
Brooke Moore, became the owners of
Darracqs. This make of car gave great
satisfaction in the early days, and only
recently I rode in a model nearly 30
yeara old. Another of the first few cars
seen in the town was built at Sunny
Corner. On its first visit to the city, the
exhaust pipe fell off in the main street,
and several souvenir hunters were
burned severely. The owner of the first
motor-cycle was Harry Redding, who
became the first motor mechanic west of
the Blue Mountains. His two-wheeler was
a Sarolia, which created a sensation by
travelling to Sydney in five hours.

find that I’d smoked my last match and
couldn’t start the vulcaniser. Had a

the point of a pocket-knife to an easily

with the longest wire, started the engine
on three, raced her up a bit and applied
the spark to the burner. It worked.
The Trouble Lamp.
S.F.S. (Maclean, N.S.W.). —The magneto on
my tractor misses under heavy load and causes
the engine to stagger. Have fitted a larger
magneto of same type, but it is so close to the
exhaust-pipe that the shellac on the coils melts.
What should I do ?
The original magneto should function per-
fectly. The trouble savors of valves rather
than ignition. Check valve clearances and
inspect seatings. To continue with the larger
magneto will necessitate redesign of exhaust
manifold.
E.G.P. (Griffith, N.S.W.).—/ have had
trouble with the magneto in my 11.9 -h.p. car.
Armature has been rewound twice in 7000
miles. Now it has gone again. Can I replace
with coil-and-battery ignition at less cost than
new mag. ?
Magneto in your type of car can be satis-
factorily rebuilt, to give excellent service. Send
the job to a specialist. Cost of conversion to
battery would be greater than fitting new mag.

Can I have it sprayed with metal and con-
verted into a high-compression type ? Where

(1) Settings are approximately correct. A
wrong choke tube may be causing the trouble.
If this is correct check valve clearances and
valve timing. (2) Send job to Metal Coatings,

G.S. (Brighton, Vic.). —Engine of my ’27
Cowley is in perfect mechanical condition,
max. speed being 50 m.p.h. on level road. !
am fitting a new light sports body and wish
to increase speed. (1) Would a supercharger
be effective ? (2) Would an extra top gear
help ? (3) Are there any other means of in-
creasing speed ? (4) What speed could I expect
to obtain ?
(1) Waste of money to fit a supercharger to
an engine of this type. (2) Higher top gear
cannot be handled even with maximum b.h.p.,
and will only result in poor all-round per-
formance. (3) Raising compression, polish-
ing combustion chamber, exhaust and inlet
parts, cleaning out inlet manifold, advancing
ignition and lowering rear axle ratio might
give you an extra 5 m.p.h., but pulling and
top-gear acceleration will be correspondingly
affected. (4) 60/65 m.p.h. with special tuning
and then only at risk of collapse of recipro-
cating parts.
H.J.M. (Goolagong, N.S.W.) . —The engine
of my car (named) overheats. Radiator has
been cleaned thoroughly by a reliable service
station, but on a run of 20 miles level coun-
try engine boiled. Remedy ?
As no adjustment is provided for valve
clearance in this car it is more than likely
that one or more valve stems, after years of
use, are now “riding” in the tappets and so
preventing valves from seating properly. Check
this and file off valve stems if necessary.
Lex (Lane Cove, N.S.W.). —My F.N. is
fitted with a Bosch mag.-dynamo, and, although
wiring seems to be in order after careful
examination, yet I have a dead short some-
where. Who can examine or service the gear ?
Pyrox Pty., Ltd., 205 Castlereagh-street,
Sydney, agents for Bosch systems.
A.J.C. (Glen Innes, N.S.W.). —(1) In the
Auburn car can top gear be brought into
play at 35 m.p.h.? Any advantage? (2) Is it
worked by suction ? (3) Is any strain put on
the back axle ?
(1) Dual ratio can be brought into opera-
tion at any road speed. Advantages are that
at 60 the motor is turning at 3750 revs, in
conventional gear, while in high top the rev.
counter only shows 2300 r.p.m. (2) It is
operated by engine suction, together with pre-
selector control similar to Wilson type gear-
box. (3) There should be no greater stress on
the back axle than when conventional fixed
gears are used.
T.G.B. (Bendigo, Vic.). —Whenever I start
the engine of my 1934 Dodge and, having
opened the door, put my finger on the metal
at the side of windscreen I get a severe elec-
tric shock. This has been going on since the
car was new —seven months— and at , Ue i
sometimes I notice sparks from mv fit, lf.
Why is this ? y 1 gers -
With driver almost perfectly insulated (f PPt

(1) No great risk provided the car is driven
quietly. (2) Should one be forced to drive
through a ford there should be no occasion to
fear trouble provided the water does not reach
the carburettor, though in cases where the ex-
haust pipe is submerged the motor will quickly
stall and cannot again be started until the

A THREE-BAND HETERODYNE SHORT-WAVE
METER.
BY DON B. KNOCK.
A calibrated heterodyne wave-meter is a most useful accessory for the
regular short-wave listener. With complete calibration on stations of
known wave-length, it may be used to find the wave-length of unknown
stations. The meter described here is inexpensive, and covers the inter-
nationally-used wave-bands by coil-switching.
After a year or so of constant tuning
over the various short-wave bands, the
experienced listener is able to judge
approximately the wave-length of some
new station. This is possible because
he reaches a stage
where his receiver
is more or less cali-
brated, and after
constant use the
positions of regu-
lar stations work-
ing on known
wave - lengths are
marked off on a
reference chart.
Even though this
may have been
done it is not pos-
sible with many
types of receivers
to achieve very
accurate calibra-
tion, for various
reasons. With the
modern all - wave
superhet fairly
accurate calibra-
tion is possible,
and once a station
is logged it is
found again at the
same dial reading.
The regenerative
receiver with a
stage of tuned
R.F., of which
there are large
numbers in daily
use, is not too reli-
able for calibra-
tion, because, in
most cases, there
is some degree of interlocking be-
tween the R.F. and detector circuits. It
is difficult, without very complete inter-
stage shielding, to prevent this. When
J. e * un i n B control is moved, it
pulls” the detector and changes the
frequency of that circuit considerably.

In this case changes in the aerial coup-
ling are neither necessary nor wanted,
and the load on the detector remains the
same at all frequencies. Once a signal

range is covered by a special shorting switch included in the
coil unit.
is logged, and assuming that valves and
voltages are constant, that signal will be
found again at the same reading, unless
the station changes frequency for some
reason. The untuned-R.F. type of re-
ceiver has certain disadvantages, and
tuned R.F. is both desirable and bene-
ficial, so that some other
frequency standard becomes
necessary for reference.
If a signal simulating a
carrier wave is produced in
the receiver from a source
which is steady, this signal
can be used to “beat”
(heterodyne) another ap-
pearing at the same fre-
quency. With one of these
signals known to be of a
certain frequency the other
can be calibrated and used
at any time it is desired to
indicate that particular fre-
quency. Hence the hetero-
dyne wave-meter, which is
nothing more than a steady
oscillator. It will be of
little reliability if it is
flimsily constructed or uses
a poor variable condenser.
Plug-in coils, as with re-
ceivers, can be used, but as
this is a frequency standard
it is better to use switching.
Unless plug-in coils are
specially built and treated,
constant handling may shift
turns in the windings and
upset calibration. On the
other hand, switching must
be certain and constant.
For this latter reason the
particular coil unit with integral switch
mechanism was chosen.
Switch Changes Wave-bands.
A very good method of switching a
coil is by the “shorted-turns” method.
Ordinarily, if this is done by a single-
switch arm some undesirable parasitic
tuning effects may be present in the cir-
cuit. The switch for this method should
therefore be of the continuous type which
completely shorts out the unused portion
of the coil. This kind of switch is in-
corporated in an excellent product of
the Lissen Co. (Eng.), obtainable in Syd-
ney from Murdoch’s radio dept. The
price is right for the average pocket, and
the device is solidly designed. Two of
them would make up a fine T.R.F. short-
wave receiver, the only difference from
usual practice being that each has its own
switch built in and there would be two
switches to oper-
ate ; but that is
really no dis-
advantage. The
illustration of the
wave-meter and
the circuit dia-
grams show how
this coil is made
and used. The
grid portion is
wound in sections
with heavy - gauge
bare wire, con-
nected in series,
and with the tap-
pings brought to
terminals in the
coil base so that
the coil can be
used without the
switch if desired.
In between the
grid sections are
s e r i e s-connected
plate-coil windings
of fine insulated
wire. These are
arranged so that
no tapping or switching is needed
here, and the necessary feedback is
provided over all ranges as the
switch selecting the grid circuit is
moved. The unit is made of red
moulded bakelite, and the switch is sup-
in a corresponding moulded base
to bolt to the coil base. Doing this auto-
matically makes the necessary switch
contacts by means of stout springs press-
ing on the heads of nickelled screws. A
iin. shaft and knob control the switch,
and it can be mounted on a panel easily
by drilling the holes indicated in the
template provided.
Reliable Condenser Necessary.
With such a coil unit a wave-meter can
be made to cover the usetui short-wave
bands without lifting a lid and changing
coils manually, and the whole thing can
be boxed in a metal case finally. This
is an advantage, as the meter can then
be used close to the receiver. Only a
weak signal is wanted, and an un-
shielded oscillator very near to a sensi-
tive receiver may “wipe out” and make
accurate heterodyning difficult.
It is not easy to find suitable con-
densers to-day with a capacity, as re-
quired here, of .00025 mfd. Some of
the .0005 mfd. types of better make to
be found around second-hand stores can
be cut down to half capacity and will
serve the purpose well. In the original
Fig. 3. —The actual connections are indicated in this diagram.
meter a combination Bruno condenser,
obtained from Murdoch’s was used. This
condenser has a wide range of capacities
by series and parallel connections of the
twin sections, but one section used as
.00025 mfd. is correct for coverage of
waves from 14 to 90 metres with the
Lissen coil unit. It is well designed, with
sturdy bearings and frame, and is never
likely to give trouble.
Vernier Dial.
Because dials have taken on a more
modern aspect it does not imply that the
bakelite-case types of earlier days are
unsuitable. An aero dial can be used if
preferred, but one of the moulded frame
dials of particularly sweet motion and
free from backlash trouble is the Tgranic
Indigraph, of which, fortunately, there
are quite a few to be had. The dial is
purely a matter of choice, but it should
be of the 0 to 100 degree variety for
calibration purposes.

bered connections to the Lissen coil.
There can be no mistake about the con-
nections, as the numbers are moulded on
Ihe coil base, and there is also an instruc-
tion sheet with each unit. It will be seen
that the wave-meter is a simple oscilla-
tor using a triode valve, built on an
aluminium frame, and with A and B bat-
tery connections provided. The structure
of the original appears thus because the
writer wished to use up some odd alu-
minium sheet and sub-panel brackets.
By far the best arrangement would be a
fair-sized aluminium box holding the
oscillator and the batteries. The valve
can be any general-purpose 2-, 4- or 6-
volt type, and a 4-volt valve is suggested
because a C battery will con-
veniently provide the filament supply.
Such a battery will last some time if the
oscillator is used only as needed and not
left running for any length of time. A
Milliard PM3, Philips A 409 or A 415,
Cossor L4lO, or any of these types will
be suitable. These are all ready oscilla-
tors with low-plate voltage. The .001-

quality mica one, and a battery switch

' Construction.
There is nothing of importance to
observe in the construction beyond
the use of rigid and heavy-gauge
wire in the grid and plate circuit.
When making the connections from
the coil unit slip a soldering lug
under the terminals instead of making
wire loops to be gripped. Terminals have
a habit of working loose on rounded sur-
faces and soldering to lugs is not only
far more reliable but actually quicker.
Readers used to making simple receivers
should have no difficulty in assembling
this wave-meter.
Using the Meter.
A 45-volt B battery and dry cell for
the filament is needed for operation. It
is necessary in the first place to make
sure that the valve is oscillating over the
whole range. Put the short-wave re-
ceiver into action on the amateur 80-
metre band, and, with the switch at the
position where the grid coil of the meter
covers this range, rotate the meter dial.
With a regenerative receiver the detector
must be just oscillating. A strong het-
erodyne signal will be heard when the
meter is tuned to almost the same fre-
quency as the receiver. If this beat note
is too strong move the meter some dis-
tance away from the receiver and try
again. Repeat the procedure on the
40- and 20-metre ranges, altering the
wave-change switch accordingly. Don’t
be confused by harmonics of the
wave-meter; these will be quite weak
in comparison with the fundamental,
and after a little practice it is easy
to tell which is which. The next
move is to wait until some short-wave
broadcasting station you are familiar with
(and of which you know the wave-length)
is audible. The wave-meter is adjusted
until the signal is at zero beat with the
carrier of the station. There are two
positions on either side of zero beat
where the whistle starts to be heard, and
zero beat is the point where the whistle
goes down to zero, or almost so. Com-
plete zero beating depends on the strength
of the wave-meter signal, and, if too
strong, the meter must be moved further
away from the receiver. This explains
the desirability of complete shielding
of the meter. Carefully check the posi-
tion on the meter dial and make a note of
the setting and the station, plus wave-
length. The same thing is done with
every station known to be on stated
wave-lengths, and the settings noted. It
will take a little time to acquire a good
bag, but when a fair number have been
noted on all ranges a graph and three
curves can be made up. A new station
appearing at some intermediate point on
the curves can then have the wave-length
indicated by reference. Making graph
curves presents no difficulty. Using
squared paper with sections of 10 squares
to the inch, the vertical portion, marked
off on a line on the left, represents the
10 dial divisions, 100 degrees in all. The
horizontal portion at the bottom is
marked off similarly in wave-length and
the points plotted. Such a wave-meter
is a really useful and interesting acces-
sory for the keen short-wave listener, and
it costs very little to make. As the valve
will not show any visible glow, don’t
forget to switch off when not in use,
otherwise the batteries will be discharged
long before their due time. A safe-
guard against such a happening would be
a dial lamp across the filament supply,
placed on the panel above the dial.

THE OPERATIC DAY OF MR. BROWN.
“Aida,” “Tannhauser,” “Fledermaus,”
“Butterfly,” “Valkyrie,” “Rigoletto,”
“Tristan,” “Trovatore,” “Faust”-*-I had
listened to broadcasts of them all in the
short space of six weeks. What a glorious
galaxy! And what a mixture! It was
after “Tristan” that I had my strange
experience.
I got to bed not very much after mid-
night and fell into a drowse through
which surged the strains of violins and
trombones, the shrill shrieks of stout
sopranos, the tearful tremolos of tubby
tenors and the baleful bellows of bulky
baritones. I was roused by a voice with
shrill bell accompaniment singing:
A wake ! A wake ! A wake !
No more lie on your back.
Put on your pants and fly to work
Or you will get the sack !
Something about this seemed familiar.
Was it from the graceful Anglicised
version of “Butterfly” or from the
equally beautiful English text of “Rigo-
letto”? Whatever it was, it was going on
outside my bedroom door, and I found
myself sitting up in bed, declaiming
melodically and with fury, in a light bari-
tone that I’m not encouraged to exercise
in the home :
Go away and let me be !
Go away and let me be!
But if I really must get up
Bring me first a cup of tea.
This I repeated seven times, getting louder
and louder, beating rhythmically on the
table at my bedside with the alarm-clock,
which continued to ring. The alarm-
clock and I finished a dead-heat on a
high F which seemed to split the welkin.
Then I sang a long aria under the
shower in the bath —a very twirly com-
position suggestive of Debussy’s laughing
faun —did blunt-razor and lost-collar-stud
recitatives and concluded the scena with
a blighting Curse in the lower register
directed against a broken bootlace. When
I took my seat at the breakfast table the
family rose en masse and chorused to the
Fire Music from “Valkyrie” ;
You’re late again! You’re late again!
Your egg is cold, your toast is dry !
Gobble them up, grab brolly and hat.
And Fly! Fly! Fly!
So I flew, catching the 8.35 by the
merest whisker. As 1 stum bed to my seat
in the now rapidly-moving train the pas-
sengers rose and chanted in the Gregorian
manner:
Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail!
Rain ! Rain ! Rain ! Rain !
'Tis a glorious thing to travel by rail,
And we’re glad you caught your train.
We’re glad you caught your train ! Ha !
Ha!
We’re glad you caught your train!
I responded to this unexpected ovation,
which so neatly epitomised Sydney
summer weather and the circumstances
of my achievement, in a narrative aria
in which I described how my twin ban-
tam roosters had received third prize at
the Roseville poultry show. This lasted
all the way to Wynyard.
Emerging from the station I found
the traffic cop, a magnificent basso, stalk-
ing up and down doing elocution and
gestures. He was roaring a sort of “Pag-
liacci” prelude:
Stand back ! Stand back ! I warn ye all.
Or I’ll clap you in the cooler.
Take but one step on this grey street
A nd I’ll show ye who’s your ruler !
So we (a large crowd) stood back, and
when we finally did troop over we sang,
very softly and slowly, to the strains of
the Pilgrims’ Chorus, interspersed with
raspberries, a few remarks about the size
of his feet.
Arriving at the office, I found the boss
stalking about in the corridor looking
like a thundercloud. Clenching his hands
and stamping first with his right foot and
then with his left, and then with both to-
gether, he sang, addressing me:
Of all the blasted idiots who live in
Sydney town
The most extremely blastedest is you,
young Robert Brown.
You do your very best to drive this
business to perdition —
In Smith and Berber's invoice are twelve
errors of addition.
This can’t go on! Go hence! Get
out ! Remove yourself instanter.
And take a fortnight’s pay from our
accountant, Mr. Tranter!
Whereupon all the 11 other clerks, who
had filed into the corridor, chanted:
It’s come at last, he’s got the sack ;
The dole, the dole awaits him!
We’re not surprised, alas, alack !
We know how Tranter hates him.
At this stage 1 found that my voice
had changed to a beautiful tenor.
Throwing my hat on the ground and
taking a long breath 1 burst into my
really big aria :
Is it for this that for six weary years
I’ve faithful served the firm of Blink
and Hedger,
And watered daily with my anxious tears
Their journals, cashbooks and the S.-Z.
ledger ?
This faulty invoice came not from my
pen.
’Twas Tranter did it —wickedest of men!
Then stepped forth my trusty friend
Parker, the cashier. In a fruity basso he
declaimed, blank-versily:
’Tis true. 1 ’Tis true! Of this foul blot
Upon the lordly shield of Blink and
Hedger
Young Brown is innocent! The dastard
T ranter,
Creeping at night back to these marble
halls,
Did forge the invoice that has roused
thine ire,
Thinking himself unseen. But this keen
eye
Was on him.
Followed a confused rush of orches-
tration during which Tranter bolted
for the lift emitting squeaks of “Foiled!”
and “Ruined!” The boss embraced
me, and announced in a brief but
(to me) very beautiful aria that he
had decided to double my screw, and
we all adjourned to the Wig and Weasel,
where drinking choruses were sung. The
thumping of pewter-pots upon the bar-
counter changed to a dull knocking on
my bedroom door. “Time to get up!’’
So I woke once more to the dull un-
opcratic world we have to live in.

Country Short-wave Explorations.
Conditions are commencing to show
the usual end-of-summer changes. The
19-metre band has been much weaker
early in the evening, and both DJB and
GSF have suffered from high-speed fad-
ing, while later in the evening FYA has
been very good.
Another station has been showing up
about 10 p.m. ; wave-length about 25.4
and too weak for identification yet, but
definitely a foreigner.
There is still no improvement in the
morning hours, either on 49 metres or
the lower bands. VUB has not been
heard during recent weeks.
DJN (31.4) is now best late at night,
and comes through at excellent strength

from midnight right through until clos-
ing at 2.30 a.m. This station recently put
on a special programme with music to
celebrate the German victory in the Saar.
The No. 1 transmission from the
8.8. C. (both stations) is now only just
audible with headphones. Some time may
elapse before real improvement is shown.
Apparently PCI, in the 19-metre band,
has proved unsatisfactory, for this station
has neither been heard nor mentioned
from PHI of late.
The French ’phone stations in and just
below the 25-metre band have been put-
ting over music as early as 9.30 p.m.;
excellent quality and fine strength. They
seem to do this when traffic is light. The
station on 24.9 is quite the strongest on
the air at the times these ’phones are
heard.
The event of the week was the first
international radio meeting between
amateurs in America and Australia via
W2XAF and VK2ME. Owing to in-
terference on 2ME from 3LR, this had
to be postponed from the original hour
(10.30 p.m.) until after 3LR closed at
10.50. By then signal strength of W2XAF
had dropped very much, and it was not
possible to get more than half the
speeches.
When W2XAF was first heard at 10.15
strength was good, but audibility always
falls off in writer’s locality after 10.30.
2ME was only fair, and only some of the
speakers could be followed.
A weak station mentioned in these
notes some time back as heard in the
early evenings came up to fine strength
on occasions, and has been found to be
2RO on the old wavelength of 25.-1
metres. This is a new hour for 2RO to
be on the air, and Italy has apparently
been stirred by the activities of other
nations. 2RO is on every night, and
closes down about 11 p.m., coming on
for the next transmission about 2.15 a.m..
but on 30.7 metres.
All the regular stations have * been
good after 10 p.m. lately, with PHI par-
ticularly good on a recent Saturday

night, when a variety programme was
transmitted.
The 49-metre band has been very
erratic, and it is really too early in the
year to expect much there in the even-
ings.
WIXAZ (31.35) came up to excellent
strength one night as early as 10 p.m.,
but has been barely audible for some
time.
Bombay seems to have given up the
short-wave transmission or changed it to
an hour not audible here.
There has been slight interference on
DJN from some weak station close
enough to heterodyne, but owing to
DJN's great strength this does not
seriously spoil the transmission at
present.
It is unfortunate that VK3LR should
be operating so close to VK2ME as to
cause heterodyning. VK2ME has used
its frequency for years, and has advertised
Australia well by the medium of short
waves.
NIGHTOWL.
Amateur Chatter.
A fair amount of 10-metre work still
goes on, but results are erratic. Owing
to attention to higher frequencies (56mc.)
the writer has been unable to keep his
station on the air on' 10, and very little
listening has been done. It is reported
that a few contacts have been made by
VKJ’s and 4’s with M.L., and 488 was
overheard telling somebody that he
heard W6JNI. Most interesting is the
report from a listener, Mr. Winton,
of Campbelltown (N.S.W.), who heard
ZSJH (South Africa), but considers
that this is a harmonic. Verifica-
tion by contact with this station on 20
should clear the air. ZSIH has pre-
viously told VK’s that he was preparing
10-metre apparatus, and may have been
using a dual transmission.
There have been one or two reason-
ably-free-from-static evenings on 40, and
the usual DX hunt can be heard in pro-
gress, not to mention ’phones. VK2JH
was heard with super-excellent quality on
'phone for a brief interval. It is under-
stood he is temporarily using low power.
2JH, whether QRO or QRP, has never
been heard with anything but good
phone over a period of years, and his
transmission is an object-lesson to some
of these misguided individuals who per-
sist in trying to modulate A.C. carriers.
John Olle, who was signing VPIZZ out
Fiji way, is now signing VP2OZ, so
evidently the old VK2 call had a wistful
appeal.
Increasing interest is shown again in
5-metre work in Sydney and suburbs, and
trom VK4MM comes news of a chain
ot stations working a regular service
round Brisbane. Keen ultra-s.w. men
should welcome the advent of the R.C.A.
955 “acorns.” They are now available,
and there should be some centimetre
work in the offing as a result.
Highlight of the week has been the
erection and testing of a beam array on 5
metres by the writer. The design at first
comprised four twisted feeder doublets
with reflectors, but it was found that the
leeders took charge, and correct adjust-
ment was not possible. After three days
of hoisting the array into the sky, taking
it down and cutting and extending wire-
the doublets were changed for
Zepps, and all trouble disappeared.
Pointing due west of Waverley at present,
results are well justified. Stations are
heard and worked at full speaker
strength, whereas they could not be heard
at all with ordinary aerial systems. It is
intended to aim the beam at Newcastle
if and when some serious co-operation
is forthcoming. Stations worked so far
include VK’s 2SA, 2CG, 2SN, 2UC, 2DT
and 2WD, and 2JH, 2WE, 2UB and 2ZV
have been heard. The difficulty is the
small number of stations available, but
with the fine results now being obtained
an influx of stations to this fascinating
band is expected. Experimenters due west
of Sydney should listen for VK2NO from
7 p.m. most evenings, and also during
the day at the week-end. By the
lime this is in print it is anticipated
that 2WD will also have a beam in
action and directed west. The final
arrangement at the writer’s station will,
it is hoped, be fitted for rotation, but
structural design presents problems.
Meanwhile co-operation is welcomed

travel along the path of the signal with

The Zero Beat Club (Sydney) was
honored by being chosen by a body of
American amateurs to converse and hold
a meeting via W2XAF and VK2ME,
Friday night, 18/1/’35. Static gener-
ated by snow hitting W2XAF’s receiving
aerials caused a little trouble at inter-
vals, but the first international amateur
radio meeting conducted by radio was
a great success, and the gangs at each
end now await group photographs of
each other.

What’s What in Radio.
“Wireless World” (England) for
30/11/’34 contains a complete chart of
directly- and indirectly-heated valve-base
connections. Although the English-type
base is seldom seen nowadays in Austra-
lia, quite a few English receivers find
their way here. Dealers likely to run up
against service work on such receivers
would find this chart useful for reference.
All English types and makes of valves
are tabulated elsewhere in the issue.

Ultra-short-wave communication over
a fair distance is greatly assisted by the
presence of a humid atmosphere, accord-
ing to “QST” (U.S.A.). This being so,
there should be little difficulty in putting
up some phenomenal performances with
5-metre communication in N. S. Wales.
The Q. and A. Column.
(1) Could 1 use a four-volt generator for A-
battery supply for the Wide-World Four re-
ceiver ? (2) What material is needed to pro-
tect the wire attached to the zinc from the sal-
ammoniac solution in constructing an A bat-
tery ? —2lB.
(1) Possibly, but speed must be absolutely
constant and commutator ripple well filtered. A
voltage regulator would be necessary. (2) A
layer of linen tape and a thick coating of
paraffin wax.
/ am interested in the article (B. 12/9/’34) on
insulating the aerial mast. Would this insula-
tion be suitable for a mast made of 2in. pipe ?
—219. 'it
Yes. The pipe should be shaped at bottom
so that it seats firmly on the insulating ball
and is not likely to slip.
/ have built the Wide-World Two, with added
audio gain (B. 5/9/’34), but cannot get the de-
tector to oscillate on the shorter wave-bands.
Oscillation is present from the amateur 40-
metre band up, but I cannot get VK3LR and
stations below this. Cathode coil turns and
coupling have been varied. What is wrong '
—223.
The first possible cause of the trouble may
be incorrect layout. Lengthy wiring in the
detector-grid circuit would be sure to stc;
oscillation at the higher frequencies. Another
trouble may be the use of an unsuitable R.F.
choke in the detector-plate circuit. This should
be one of the three-section honeycombs and
not a single-coil type. Faulty grid leak and
condenser could also be responsible.
Our seven-valve Astor radio set gave splendid
daylight reception for 12 months. Stations
cannot now be heard in the daytime, but night
reception is normal. A 32-volt genemotor is
used for plate supply. This has a 150 -volt out-
put, but as the valves, 49, 30, 32, 34 and 15,
are rated at 135 volts, 135 volts is the most
used. The aerial is in good order. (1) Would
it harm the valves to use the full generator
output ? (2) Are any components likely to
give out in such a short space of time ? Valves
have been replaced with no improvement. (3)
Could any harm be done by readjusting the
condenser-gang trimmers ? —222.
(I) No. (2) Resistors and fixed condensers
could give trouble. These should be examined
and checked over carefully by a competent
radio mechanic. Valves can be eliminated as
the possible cause in these circumstances. (3)
Yes, unless this is very carefully done. Make
a screwdriver from a bone knitting needle or
wooden dowel. Tune the receiver to a station
near the centre of the band and very carefully
adjust the detector trimmer for strongest signal.
Repeat this process with the R.F. stages, rock-
ing the tuning slightly meanwhile, and then do
the same with stations at the top and bottom of
the band. The trimmers could be the cause
ol the trouble, as the capacity is likely to alter
by absorbing moisture over a period of time.


RHEUMATISM
Joints Stiff, Swollen and Painful
If your joints are stiff, swollen and filled
with pain, you are so badly handicapped
that you are little better than a prisoner or
a slave. You cannot be a success either
socially or commercially, and you certainly
cannot enjoy life as you should. You will
find it hard to believe that
your suffering is unneces-
sary, but surely you will be
willing to make an effort to
get well, and your effort will
not be in vain if you get a
box of De Witt’s Pills from the chemist
and take them as directed.
No doubt you have already tried all sorts
of things—embrocations, liniments, oils,
medicated baths, purgative
salts—and perhaps you are
disappointed, and disgusted
as well, because
they have failed
to give you the
relief you desire,
but, just for one
week, forget your
disappointments,
and decide that
you will give
De Witt’s Kidney
and Bladder Pills
a fair trial.
HEALTHY KIDNEYS
REMOVE
URIC..ACID
TAKE TWO TO-NIGHT
Take two of DeWitt’s Pills to-night
and in the morning you will see and
feel and know for certain that they
must do yon good.
Throughout your future life you will be
glad if you do this, because De Witt’s Pills
never disappoint, and you can take them
with absolute confidence in their ability to
do you good.
Watch for such symptoms as puffiness
under the eyes, heaviness of
the limbs, swollen feet or
ankles, foul breath, scalding
pain, gravel or stone. These
symptoms usually precede
attacks of Rheumatism,
Backache, Lumbago, Sciatica or serious
Kidney Trouble, and much suffering and
expense may be saved by quickly getting
a box of De Witt’s Pills from the chemist
and taking them as directed.
They cost only 3/6, or the larger size,
containing 2\ times the quantity, 6/6. All
chemists sell them in the blue, white and
gold boxes, so that you will have no diffi-
culty in obtaining supplies. You will derive
certain benefit from the first dose, and as
you continue, the pain and stiffness will
leave your limbs and joints, and in a very
short time you will fully regain your health
and strength. These results have been
obtained by many thousands of men and
women who were tortured by rheumatism
and joint pains. Be persuaded to do as
they did —take

Power-alcohol
Having been farmer, chemist and
internal-combustion engineer, I am all for
liie production of power-alcohol in Aus-
tralia. There are three main economic
sources of raw material; wheat and oat
straw, potatoes and wood pulp. Each is
capable of being fermented and distilled
to produce an alcohol, denatured, at
between Is. 6d. and 2s. a gallon, always
provided the distilling plant is on a large
scale.
Cereal straw is now a waste product,
burnt in the autumn. It could be raked,
baled and dispatched to the distillery.
Germany has shown what can be done
with potatoes; until the Georgian oil-
fields were discovered, a great part of her
motor power was derived from alcohol.
And quite a good power-alcohol can be
made from shredded wood, treated by
the sulphite processes. Australia has
timber enough.
Under proper organisation each farmer-
supplier could be given the “slops” of
the stuff he sends in—they would be
more valuable as manure than burnt or
ploughed-in stubble. The potato residues
might be used with concentrate for stock
feed. You could have local depots for
treating bulk stuff- —converting it to fer-
mentation liquor, condensing it and dis-
patching it by rail lank cars —but you
must have central distilleries and begin on
i large scale. Small enterprises are doomed
to failure— John Arden (N.S.W.).
Overtime for Children
Why doesn’t some philanthropist move
to bring schools under Factories Acts?
The manner in which young children are
compelled to devote nearly all their wak-
ing hours to study is one of the most
serious scandals of the age. Kiddies
spend five hours daily in their class-
rooms, with intervals for meals and play.
Five hours’ work, mental work, if it is
done properly, is plenty for any growing
child. But the system regards this only
as a beginning.
The average child pulls out his books
the moment his home dinner is over and
puts in another two hours—if he is lucky
or exceptionally brilliant or exceptionally
lazy. The ordinary f.a.q. child is often
going hard at it until 10 p.m.
Vic. Teachers’ Conference made a pro-
test against this evil, so it is not the
teachers who are to blame. The trouble
lies with the “greengrocer politicians,”
referred to at the recent Science Con-
gress, who, knowing nothing of the sub-
ject, give orders to those who do. — Como
(Vic.).
Star Chamber Methods
In May last Queensland’s Transport
Board—it consists of the Commissioners
of Railways, Roads and Police—lost two
cases on appeal before the Full Court.
The verdict against the Crown freed some
80 carriers from seizure, under warrant,
of their plant and gear, on account of
non-payment of the board’s fantastically
high license fees.
As a New Year gift to the commercial
world, the board took advantage of the
Parliament’s death to increase licensing
charges on heavy motor vehicles —to, in
some cases, nearly £lOOO p.a. apiece.
Moreover, it enacted that any such
vehicle whose driver cannot produce on
demand an official receipt for the tax —
payable in advance—may be summarily
seized and held. In plain words, the
board claims to be able to take away
from owners of this class of vehicle the
right to have the legal position tested
again before the same Courts which in
May decided against the board. Nor is
this the full measure of the board's claim
to full .Star Chamber privileges; the
rights of owners of such vehicles hired
out to other persons are ignored.
Queensland has urgent need for better
and less costly transport service than her
union-ridden railways can ever provide.
Magnificent roads are being built, but
the Roads Commissioner, in his capacity
of Transport Board member, is com-
mitted to help in keeping everything off
them except private pleasure cars,
wherever they come near a railway. Yet
hundreds of miles of the roads run
alongside railways.
It is fortunate that Cobb’s coaches
never became a Government monopoly.
Otherwise we might not have had even
railways, only a Coach-horse Breeders’
Board demanding total exclusion of
motors and aeroplanes, with punitive and
confiscatory powers complete.— Notaden
(Q-).
Shorter Hours
The working man does not see, with
“De Aar” (B. 23 /IK ’35), that “if five men
dig a trench in eight hours it will take 10
men four hours to do the same work.”
That was a simple problem in proportion
before the steam navvy came. To put
the same problem from another angle:
Ten years ago 100 men could get from
10 acres goods that sold for £x ; to-day
five men pins machinery get the same
commodity return from one acre. Logi-
cally, the selling price should be
5 1
X X £x, plus machinery cost,
ICO 10
or the five men should get what 1000
men originally received, less machinery
charge.
In the old opencut at Yallourn (Vic.),
200 workers produced 800 tons of coal
per shift. To-day 45 workers plus
machinery get 65,000 tons in the same
time. There has been no proportionate
increase in wages or decrease in coal
prices ; the persons who lent the money
for winning the 800 tons expect to get
productivity that machinery provides. The
farmer is up agairfst the same problem.
With falling prices he has to provide
more commodities to pay interest. He
puts off men and destroys his only chance
of getting a higher price, because his best
market is destroyed.
The banks have 50 million pounds that
they can’t lend, not because people don’t
want to invest, but because the buying
public doesn’t exist. The man with
financial resources must find work for
his money, as banks cannot go on pay-
ing interest on money they cannot lend.
We workers view the future with
equanimity, knowing that, sooner or
later, hours, not wages, will be reduced f
our present civilisation is to continue
The worker, as well as owner, will have
to get a share of the benefit that machin-
ery gives.— Keg (N.S.W.).
Babbitt in the Dock
Dr. Duhig, of Brisbane, president of
the medical section at Melbourne Science
Congress, was quite rude to Babbitts in
his address. He smote not only business
Babbittry but medical Babbittry, social
Babbittry, legal Babbittry—all the little
Babbitts in that vast warren we call the
world.
No socialist is Dr. Duhig—witness hh
bitter antagonism to nationalised medi-
cine—and he is certainly not a Fascist:
he asserts that the Federal Government
tends towards Fascism as certain State
Governments tend towards Communism.
But he is revolutionary in the sense that
he aims at revolutionising life in im-
portant departments and placing it on a
scientific basis. As he sees it,
Ten per cent, of civil servants control
ignorant Ministers and, through them.
Parliaments and the people. They have
training that is clerical and legalistic, not
scientific and progressive, so that gov-
ernment is childishly empirical.
As for the depression,
To blame science for this is to blame
L i a * nigc i un 8 ,e cro P of cocoanuts
that the monkeys cannot get at because of
their inherent jack of intelligence.
Dr. Duhig chides the medical pro-
fession for its use of dog-Latin in pre-
scriptions, law and religion for requiring
its heads to “deck themselves out in
fancy dress” ; and he wishes to see the
wellsprings of charity dried up by a
permanent political drought. He wants
frankness in sex matters, sees nothing
wrong in birth-control, and can perceive
no hope of rapid evolution towards a
universal happiness until the scientific
outlook is imposed on politics.
A man of courage and ability inveigh-
ing against what he deems to be wrong
is always an interesting spectacle. The
difficulty is that, though Dr. Duhig is
an excellent diagnostician, he has pro-
vided humanity with no prescription—in
dog-Latin or plain English. He has
stated what he wants, but he has failed
to indicate the means of obtaining his
objectives. He asks for a more scientific
attitude in politics, but has not suggested
any method whereby that attitude mav
be secured.-

NOTIONS

Under the Whip
Main feature of the racing at Ascot,
Melbourne, was the reappearance of Ver-
berry (Verbius —Foxberry), a St. Leger
aspirant. Though he failed in the Vic-
toria Derby and Melbourne Cup, this
colt gave more than one promising dis-
play of galloping during the spring, and
it was prophesied that he would be heard
of to good effect in the autumn. H. B
Lorigan, who originally had charge of
Verberry, left him in Victoria to be
spelled. The colt temporarily is in other
hands, but will rejoin Lorigan’s string
in Sydney.
Produced for the seven furlongs Buck-
ingham Welter at Ascot, Verberry was
burdened with top weight (9st. 51b.) on
a rain-soaked track. F. H. Robinson, the
owner, while not expecting his colt, being
backward in condition, to win, re-
marked, with emphasis, “He will be a
different horse in three weeks’ time.” But
punters who realised the superior class
of Verberry would not allow him to run
against them, and 7 to 1 was the
best offer at barrier-rise. Ridden to
more advantage, Verberry might have

won, instead of losing by half a length
to the queerly-named Musstte, who is
owned by H. R. Telford. After being
near the tail of the field, he was rushed
up to the leaders at the far turn by Elliot,
and led into the straight. To avoid soft
going ijear the rails, Elliot diverted his
mount *into the centre of the track.
Musstte took advantage of the opening
thus presented, and wore down his rival,
from whom he was in receipt of 261 b.
Musstte (Windbag—Lutra) is a brother to
Grand Orator, for whom A. Crofts, the
Victorian chain-store proprietor, gave
llOOgns. as a yearling last autumn.
Telford is having a run of luck. He
won with Petit Fils at Moonee Valley
on January 26, and captured the C. F,
Orr Stakes at Williamstown with Break
Up, who, among other horses, beat Hall
Mark and Gaine Carrington. In the Wil-
liamstown race Musstte also carried the
colors of Telford, but he finished last,
as might be expected, considering it was
a weight-for age contest. There are pos-
sibilities in Musstte, who is on the im-
prove, and the fact of there being an
element of luck in his victory over Ver-
berry indicates that the latter colt may
be a dangerous rival of Theo and Sylvan-
dale in the V.R.C. St. Leger. He is a
certain starter, barring accidents in the
meantime.
The Caulfield owner-trainer H. Leek
had an acceptor in each of the six events
at Ascot, but he withdrew Waltzing
Nellie from the Buckingham Handicap,
probably being of opinion that the filly
would be unequal to handling 9st. 31b.
with success in the heavy going. Devon-
court, a colt by Devonshire from Tra-
quette, was seized upon by punters as
the best of the three-year-olds, notwith-
standing that the little apprentice Har-
rison was again entrusted with the mount.
Nearly all the progeny of Traquette have
favored their dam in being abnormally
big. Salads, a half-brother to Devon-
court, who won the Futurity Stakes of
1923, was a giant. Devoncourt cannot be
compared with Salads for speed, but he
has latent merit. This will not be de-
veloped until a strong rider is secured for
him. The colt ran up into third place at
the half-way stage on Saturday, but after-
wards would not take hold ol the bit for
his midget jockey.
Waltzing Nellie’s owner, who bets
courageously and has given the Mel-
bourne ring some hard knocks, went for
a plunge on Tattenham in the Nursery
Handicap. This colt is by Manfred from
the 1918 Oaks winner Stagegirl, and
carries the livery of A. L. Lane. He
did not finish “in the money” on Satur-
day ; but it was rather a rough race, and
Tattenham met with obvious interference
in the straight. However, he did not look
to have any chance when this occurred.
Mallacy (10 to 1) assisted the ringmen
to have another profitable afternoon.
She led into the straight by several
lengths and lasted long enough to defeat
Meadow Man—destined to win before
long—by a neck. Mallacy is by Chival-
rous (imp.), and on the other side of her
.pedigree traces back to the dam of
Comedy King.
Stakes at Ascot —once a “pony”
course, but now nearly as important a
convincing ground as Moonee Valley
or Williamstown —amounted to £2ooo—
as much as was distributed at Rose-
hill on the same afternoon. The Ascot
Handicap, of £SOO, went to Last Court,
owned by J. T. Hayes, who landed the
A.J.C, Steeplechase of 1927 with Gul-
yarri. Partial to soft going, Last Court
came with a great rattle from the home
turn, and scored comfortably from Little
Queen, a Launceston Cup candidate, and
Petau, the favorite.

Chatham is to do no more racing, but
Winooka, that other great son of Wind-
bag, remains ; and no one who saw him
lead a smart Carrington Stakes field for
four furlongs, with lOst. 51b, up—m
heavy going at that—would deny him
a chance in the Oakleigh Plate with the
same weight, or in the Newmarket with
41b. less. He seems better treated in
both races than Closing Time, Heros and
Press Gang, to whom he has to con-
cede 91b, (all three) in the Plate and the
same, as to Press Gang and Heros, in
the .Newmarket —Closing Time’s New-
market weight is 9st, 71b. If Winooka
goes for the Plate his most dangerous
opponent may be Theresa Gamba (7st.).
In times past good two-year-olds won
the Plate, and Theresa Gamba is a flier.
Of the three-year-olds in the New-
market, Silver King has Bst. 111 b.,
Arachne Bst. 91b., Sir John and Titanium
Bst, 41b., The Marne Bst. and Radiant
Star 7st. 121 b. Sir John may prove the
best, but this Page would rather have
Winooka than any of them. Break Up
should have a decided chance with
Bst. 61b.
Maoriland horses have caught it hot
in the Australian Cup: Vintage 9st. 71b.,
Master Brierly Bst. 131 b. and Sir Simper
Bst. 91b, Topical has Bst. 121 b., Theo
Bst. 61b., Sylvandale Bst. 31b. and Regal
Son Bst. 21b. The Westralian Cueesun
did not figure among the nominations
published in the Melbourne dailies, but
his entry must have come along all right,
and the handicapper has not been hard
on him—7st. 121 b. And a likely pair
of three-year-olds are Verberry (7st. 51b.)
and Contact (6st. 121 b.).
Early choices: Theresa Gamba (Plate),
Winooka (Newmarket) and Cueesun
(Australian Cup).

to 2) made the opposition in the Flying
Handicap look like tired shearers’ hacks.
Regular Bachelor was backed as if the
race were merely an exercise gallop for
the Queensland colt. Second to Hold-
fast at the five furlongs, he took charge
at the turn, but Canegrass had the race
in his keeping at the Leger. Question-
naire was second, three lengths away ;
then came Regular Bachelor, Misnomer
and Holdfast. Exaltation was last. His
Brisbane form was good, but he has lost
it.
Turbine, a stable-mate of Canegrass,
was made favorite for the Rosehill Han-
dicap. He has never shone at a mile and
a quarter, but the opposition was weak,
and he was well handicapped at nine
stone. He was never in the picture. Par-
courir set a solid pace, with Kagal trail-
ing the leader ; and it was evident a long
way from home that Sawyer’s horse
would win. Passing the half-mile Kagal
shot away, and the rest was a proces-
sion, though Sat'moth and Regal Star
finished pretty well. Parcourir was fourth
and Antique a bad last. The time, 2min.
was only half a second outside the
track record.
Backed from 5 to 2 to 6 to 4, Grand
Mogul, a stylish-looking colt by Waltz-
ing Lily’s sire Beau Fils, gave J. C. Ben-
drodt, who owns and trains him, an easy
win in the Juvenile. It was an impres-
sive performance, as the colt, drawn wide,
did not jump away well and had to be
hustled along in the first furlong; he
jazzed in by three lengths from Rubens
and Rummage. Heroina and Heroic
Faith were fourth and fifth; Heroic
Faith was checked several times in the
straight.
Broccoli (7 to 2), who is trained at
Warwick Farm, had to be ridden out to
beat Love Song in the Carlingford Mile.
The favorite, Chatterelle, had no luck in
running ; she was pocketed on the rails
most of the way, and when she did get
out near the Leger was not' given much
room by Broccoli. In the circumstances
her third was a fair effort. Munro rode
Broccoli, and also Coinash (10 to 1), who
scored in the Trial Stakes in a manner
that suggested more victories. A son of
Saltash —Coinage now in his eighth
year, Coinash was turned out in capital
trim by Jack Munro, a brother of Darby.

Ins and Outs
“Headingley”: The Australian case
against bodyline received unexpected en-
dorsement when Lord Hawke said at the
annual meeting of Yorkshire county that
the Australians were right in protesting
against the bowling of Voce at Notting-
ham. The old gentleman gave Carr away
badly by revealing that he had been all
against the “direct-attack” type of bowl-
ing at the joint meeting of the English
Board of Control and the County Ad-
visory Committee. Carr says his ludship
is talking rot; no bowler under his
captaincy was ever permitted direct attack.
Carr was certainly not skipper in the
Australian match, but he was in other
games in which protests against this type
of bowling were made, notably those
between Notts and Lancashire and
Middlesex. ■ •
! =.' : * :[! *
“Spin”: Fleetwood-Smilh’s success in
the Victoria-N.S.W. match has made him
a serious rival to Grimmett for the job
of googly expert on the South African
tour. But the Victorian has far to go
before he equals the Maorilander’s con-
sistency. Grimmett has the rare record
of having taken 100 wickets for S.A.
against Victoria, N.S.W. and Queensland,
in addition to 100 for Australia against
England. This apart from those wickets
he took in Sheffield cricket for Victoria.
Grimmett has the advantage over Smith
in that he is a really sound batsman with
a flair for getting badly-wanted runs at
a pinch. It was Smith’s batting which
drove him to give up cricket for tennis
some years ago, and so far it has gone to
show that the young man’s judgment was
sound.
(Continued on page 36.)
Racquet and Bawl
“Rev. Knucklebone”: Menzel’s defeat
of Crawford (B. 23/1 /’35) was the third
in the three meetings of the pair. The
first was in the German championships
three years ago, the second in the Davis
Cup tie last year. The seers are loudly
foretelling the meeting of Australia and
America in the final of the European
zone. I would warn the Australians to
beware of a tall, dark man who will
cross their path somewhere in Central
Europe.
* * * *
“Bournemouth”: -The argument in
England as to the advisability of three
or five sets for championship matches is
being debated in Australia. In England
Austin, not famous for his stamina,
for three sets; others object that thr
three-setter is all over for some players
before they can get into their stride.
Hughes and Boussus are definite on five
sets for doubles at least. Quist and
Turnbull favor them for singles also.
“Ike McBagg”: I don’t know whether
anyone is making a book on whether
or not Perry will be swallowed up by
Hollywood and professionalism. During
the past two or three weeks a careful
fielder would have had a good chance
of getting round on his book and sitting
pretty. Alternating denials by Perry and
confident statements by Hollywood
and professional tennis heads have had
the market jumping all ways. Hughes
has added a touch of mystery which
has shortened the odds against amateur-
ism. Commenting on Perry’s proposed
stay with friends at Los Angeles, Hughes
says that it is “not unlikely Perry will
explore possibilities.” He adds darkly
that it is too dangerous for him to ex-
press an opinion as to how the cat will
jump, but he knows Perry wishes to
remain an amateur.
(Continued on page 37.)
Mosman took the N.S.W. champion
eights, rowed over the three-mile Nepean
course, by only four feet from the Police
crew. Stroke for the winners was a
youngster, Burrell, who had the same
position in the Shore boat in last year’s
race for the head of the river, and there
were four others in the crew who were
recently school rowers. Mosman led all
the way. Sydney was never in it. Turner
kept his sculling title, beating W. J.
Tipping by six lengths. The umpire
threw out a protest, but it’s been sent
on to the association.

Under the Whip
In Sydney and at least one other Aus-
tralian city it has been common talk for
years that riders over the sticks put their
heads together and decide which member
of the union shall be first. Hitherto proof
has been lacking ; but the attention of
the A.J.C. stewards was attracted by “the
conduct of certain riders prior to and
concerning the Hurdle Race” at Rand-
wick on Jan. 26. Asa result Guy has
been sent out for life, while Pearce has
been disqualified and Sholl suspended
during the stewards’ pleasure, Windle,
who rode the winner. Sly Lad, was
exonerated. “Further persons” are to be
asked to give an account of themselves
in connection with the case, and the
A.J.C. committee is to consider an allega-
tion that “a monetary inducement was
given, for a corrupt purpose by one
jockey to another prior to and in con-
nection with the running of” a hurdle
race at Canterbury on August 4. On that
occasion also Windle steered the winner
Spider King. Conceivably this is the
beginning of the end of hurdle-racing in
Sydney. The A.J.C. has made great
efforts to popularise it, but has been ill-
supported.
* * *
The failure of Capris in the A.J.C.
Adrian Knox Stakes is far from support-
ing this Page’s notion (B. 23/1 /’35) that
she is the fastest three-year-old in Aus-
tralia up to a mile. On the morning of
the race she had galloped two furlongs
in 24 seconds, so she lacked nothing on
the score of condition ; but McCarten's
riding came in for criticism. He is a
very good jockey, but it was his first im-
portant mount after the accident which
kept him out of the saddle for some time,
and he did not show his customary vigor
and judgment. Pratt rode the chestnut
filly in the Christmas-New Year races, in
Which she twice beat Dromos and Impasto
(good winners subsequently), giving both
weight. Anyway, no horse should be con-
demned on one indifferent performance,
and The Bulletin still regards Capris as
a likely winner of the Doncaster.
* * * *
“Cantilever”: Preposterous are the re-
ports that get about concerning the
wagers landed by punters. After one of
the big races at the A.J.C. Anniversary
meeting it was all over Randwick that a
member of an old local family, noted for
his shrewdness in picking ’em, had backed
the winner for a fortune. The sum first
mentioned was £3OOO, but as the news
passed from mouth to mouth it soared
to double that figure. I am acquainted
with the young man in question, and can
testify to the extent of his commission.
He had one (1) pound on.
* * * *
“Mariner”; An unofficial racebook
sold at half the shilling charged for
the official publication seems to have
established itself in Sydney. Previous
competition of the kind had run up
against the copyright law, but appar-
ently the publishers get over this by not
printing the weights. They could be
checkmated, one would think, by a return
to the old “card or book” system. The
card was 6d. ; it contained little more
than numbers, names of owners and
horses and weights, but a great many
people to whom 6d. is a consideration re-
quire no more. The truth is racing costs
too much. The railways and tramways
sting people for twice the ordinary fares ;
proprietary clubs charge 14s. for a pad-
dock ticket to see third-raters, and in the
refreshment-room it’s Is. 6d. for tea
(brought in the cup) and pie or scones. It
all helps the starting-price fraternity,
*
Registration of bookmakers, race-
course and shop, has brought more re-
venue to the Adelaide Government, but
it has done racing no good. After an
initial spurt, perhaps largely the effect
of curiosity, there has been a fall in race-
course attendances and tote receipts, and
clubs are complaining loudly. Under the
law they receive three-fifths of the 2 p.c.
turnover tax on bookmakers in respect of
races held in S.A. They are now asking
for the lot.
* ❖ * *
“Thormanby”: Not every horse has
his biography written, though Gloaming
among Australasian nags received that
honor. I have just been reading the life
of Brown Jack, an aged English handi-
capper who wormed himself into the
affections of the racing public in a
fashion no triple-crown aristocrat could
emulate. He was always ridden by Steve
Donoghue, and his specialty was winning
the Alexandra Stakes at Ascot, the
longest race in Britain, which he carried
off seven years in succession. Like our
own Carbine, he was known as “Old
Jack,” and was a horse of marked idiosyn-
crasies. One of his habits was going to
sleep in a sitting position on his iron
manger. His trainer tried to make things
more comfy for him by having the hard
manger padded with thick felt. Next
morning he found “Old Jack” had torn
the felt off and was asleep with his stern
comfortably settled on the cold iron.
Ins and Outs
In her match against Victoria in
Sydney Ma was left with 391 to get in
the fourth innings—a stiff job, but not
impossible on a perfect pitch with all day
to do it in. But, apart from McCabe
“Hey, rig yer jib, Mudface, or she’ll
pass as!”
(53), the batting was rotten, and the last
wicket fell at 178. Fleetwood-Smith took
8 for 113, making his total for the match
15 for 226. So Victoria, with every
match won, is “home and dried” for the
Shield.
“Trundler”; The feat of taking 15
wickets in a Sheffield match had only
been done four times, though Hugh
Tmmble took that number against South
Australia in 1899 before the Shield series
began. George Giffen, got 16 for 109 for
S. Aus. v. N.S.W. and 15 for 110 against
Vic.; Grimmett, 16 for 289 against
Queensland this season; McKibbin, 15
for 125 for N.S.W. v. S. Aus.
* * Hj H*
“Tenth Slip”; Before Fleetwood-Smith
went to England most people regarded
him as an amiable eccentricity, able to
bowl one unplayable ball in an after-
noon. His opening performances in Eng-
land did nothing to alter the impression,
and he was usually rated as easy meat
for any forcing batsman, thanks to un-
merciful floggings from Hammond and
others who could take advantage of his
tendency to bowl tripe. This season in
Australia he hasn’t had a bad match, and
his 15 for 226 against a good N.S.W. bat-
ting side has silenced the scoffers. To
the end of the N.S.W. match the young
Victorian had taken 55 for an average
of 18.43, leading the redoubtable Grim-
mett by four wickets. Each has one
match to play.
West Indies won the second Test with
England at Trinidad by 217 runs. It was
a match full of alarums and excursions.
Constantine was “called” by Arthur
Richardson, who was umpiring, for
bowling at the batsman, and was taken
off ; Smith, of England, retaliated, and
Wyatt removed him unasked. The
second-last ball of the final day got Ley-
land, who had been stonewalling against
time, 1.b.w.; then the darkies went wild.
=i= * * *
“Stayer”; That sound and stimulating
cricketer Vic. Richardson, who not long
since completed his 6000 runs in Sheffield
Shield cricket, must have established
something near a record for the cap-
taincy of a State team. Richardson began
to lead S. Aus. into the field quite 14
years ago, if not more, and he looks as
if he might continue doing it for a few
years longer. During that time the aver-
age period of captaincy for a Vic. or
N.S.W. player has doubtfully been half
a dozen years ; old stars have regularly
waned and new stars have succeeded
them. Can anyone nominate a State cap-
tain who has lasted longer or worn
better?
The Nineteenth Hole
“St. Quentin”; Our friends of the
American professional golf team were
not long getting into action after return-
ing to their homeland. In a Los Angeles
open tournament Sarazen tied for third
place ; Revolta and Ghezzi tied for first
with 285, Ghezzi winning the play-off and
5000 dahlers. Sarazen’s score was 288 —
not bad for a man who must have walked
right off the boat. Runyan (290) and
Laffoon (291) are other members of the
Australian circus mentioned in the cable.
* * * *
“Shirley”: Sarazen may admire Maori-
land golfers (B. 30/1/’35), but he hasn’t
much time for some of the spectators. He
was mightily indignant with the hc
of Wellington for gate-crashing d. lZens
his exhibition there. Many of tw Uring
did not actually give the gatekeepers^ 0
don t argue threw down 2s. instead
the ss. upset charge as they barSd °
remarking that a florin was enough m
watch golf. Sarazen and Kirkuk
had much the same experience ; n KWoocl

was that most of the big crowd JK
even cough up a silver coin. nt

“Diehard” : The annual meeting of m
N.S.W. Golf Council promises to
rare old Donnybrook. Discontent
delegates and there are many™
tabling sweeping amendments of iu
constitution aimed at removing the a 7
cendancy of Royal Sydney and Aik"
tralia. It is proposed that the counci
consist of two delegates each from R ov ,
Sydney, Australia, Manly, Killara Con
cord, Moore Park, Long Reef Lake'
N.S.W., Bonnie Doon and Pymble i n ’
stead of the present one made up of four
delegates each from Royal Sydney and
Australian, four from the Suburban
District Association, and four from the
Suburban and Country Association
Registered metropolitan clubs within a
thirty-mile radius of the G.P.O and
country clubs outside the radius are also
to be represented, the metropolitan clubs
by 10 delegates collectively and the coun-
try clubs by one delegate each. And it
is proposed to have an executive com-
mittee of 14, to be elected from the dele-
gates annually. This would take
away the control at present exercised
by the two senior clubs, which would
also be deprived of the right to nominate
the courses for championship meetings
as heretofore.
* * * *
“Susie Swattit”; Women golfers in
England are in a pretty tangle over the
amateur status. Last year Joyce Wethered
and Enid Wilson had their entries for
the British championship turned down,
Miss Wethered for advising buyers of
golf goods at Harrods and Miss Wilson
for writing on golf for the press. As the
names of both have been appearing in
club events of late it was thought on this
side that they had been whitewashed.
This is not the case, and there is a move
now to abolish the word “ama-
teur” from the conditions of all
events controlled by the British
women’s union. As Molly
Gourlay, herself a champion,
points out, hundreds <of un-
known women selling golf re-
quisites play as amateurs with-
out question. It is another
story with a champion, and the
same applies in the case of writ-
ing for the press.
* * *
“Carnoustie”; When Jimmy
Thomson walked off with the
Vic. centenary open champion-
ship it was generally supposed
he was an American who was compara-
tively an outsider in big golf. He is no
Yank, having been born in the Kingdom
of Berwick, where his father was a pro-
fessional at North Berwick links and his
mother a sister of Jack White, open
champion in 1904 —a 'solid golfing pedi-
gree. Thomson, senior, was transferred
to the Richmond club in Virginia by W.
J. Magee, an American patron of golf,
in 1920, when Jimmy was 10 years old.
James adopted golf as a profession, and
tied with Hagen at the end of the second
day of the British open in 1929. He is to
have another shy this year.
* * * *
“Hoylake”; British golfers are torn
with dissension over the proper color to
paint the flag sticks so as to make them
readily distinguishable. Most of these
fade into their surroundings at a shot
distance, and binoculars havs to be usee
to spot them. Experiments indicate tha
the best combination is a stick painte

“The Hutt”: Betty Gaisford, the M.L.
onlf champion, who was in Australia for
the last women’s championship after tour-
' Britain with Miss Kay, has turned in
he same, for a couple of years at least.
She is committing matrimony in March,
ond though that is no excuse for giving
ud golf the fact that she will be living
far from any course has helped in her
decision It was hoped she would be
available to tackle the Englishwomen at
Ihe championship meeting at Melbourne
next August and later in M.L., when the
tourists invade the Isles of the Blest.
Racquet and Bawl
“Rev. Knucklebone”: The find of the
tennis season has been young Bromwich,
of Sydney, who at 16 has played him-
self into the championship class. At
Perth he beat Menzel and Maier. The
visit of the overseas players has taught
him a lot, though naturally his game
still calls for improvement, particularly
the service and smash. Unfortunately,
the youth has given evidence of pettish-
ness on the courts —they call it “tempera-
ment” in tennis. A certain amount of
swelled head is allowable in the circum-
stances, but Bromwich will have to cut
out this unfortunate tendency if he is to
fulfil the promise he has given. It can
be done. Compare the restraint of Perry
this last trip with his song-and-dance
antics when he was here before.
* * * *
“Let”: Sydney has not seen the last
of our tennis visitors from overseas.
While Menzel, Kirby and the others
homeward wend their weary way, Stefani
and Maier will be back on February 18
heading for Java. Whether the pair
will have any time for tennis in Sydney
is not clear, though it may be taken as
certain that the Ma State tennis heads
will do their best to squeeze another ex-
hibition game out of them.
* * * *
“Centre Court”; The question of what
part Turnbull is to play in the Davis
Cup team has been settled by his
appointment as manager and treasurer.
He was not called on to play in the last
Davis Cup series, and it is not expected
he will be this time, though he will
relieve his colleagues in minor engage-
ments and will figure at Wimbledon and
in the French championships. He had
experience of the job in 1933-4, and as
he is a tactful bird and a good mixer
should fill the billet well.
* * * *
“Top Spin”: The A.L.T.A. has resolved
to cut out the Bournemouth fixture, a
feature of former tours in England, con-
sidering that it will add to the work of
the team without any advantage. Also,
Crawford objects to the place because
he always contracts asthma there —a
charge that will infuriate the authorities
of Bournemouth, which makes much of
its suitability for sufferers from chest and
throat complaints. Turnbull, who has
found it hard to get away this time, is to
he released after the last Davis Cup
match or the Wimbledon meeting.
* jj: sk *
‘‘Rev. Knucklebone”: Like the tiger
which has tasted blood, the Australian
tennis heads are looking about for fresh
victims. At a meeting of the A.L.T.A.
m Melbourne Norman Brookes was in-
structed to see what he could do in the
way of getting further international visi-
°rs f° come over, perhaps this year.
Americans are particularly desired, and
, Helen Wills and Helen Jacobs can be
lured along all the better. Brookes is
also to see if an international tourney
or women on the lines of the Davis Cup
can be arranged. If that happy objective
is attained, then we shall have profes-
sional amateur women players in addi-
tion to the masculine variety who gallop
madly from one Davis Cup tourney to
another, with just time for an inter-
national visit or so in between.
* * * *
“Amateur Pro.”: Touching that pro-
posal of the Czechs, backed by Britain,
that tennis-players be permitted to show
in films for payment without losing their
amateur status, let me quote International
Tennis Federation Rule 23 (clause g),
which it is proposed to amend:
An amateur tennis-player is specifically
prohibited from (g) accepting money or
gaining pecuniary advantage by (i) posing
for or permitting the taking of lawn-tennis
action-film pictures of himself.
Yet an amateur may make pictures and
appear in them for pay, provided they
are not tennis-action motion-pictures of
himself and don’t teach or demonstrate
tennis nor advertise goods for manufac-
turers or traders. A case in point is the
American Shields, who, thinly disguised
as a perdoocer, is now drawing a fat
salary at Hollywood while remaining an
amateur.
* * * *
“Amateur Pro.”: Cabled that the
French Ministry of Sport is sending
Cochet, now a professional, on a tour of
the world giving exhibitions of tennis and
lecturing on the game with the assistance
of films. Henri is expected to play against
amateurs and professionals, and there is
a catch here as far as members of the
International Tennis Federation are con-
cerned. A new rule makes it compulsory
for affiliated countries to ask permission
before playing amateurs and profes-
sionals together. Before that national
associations could decide the matter for
themselves. In Australia meetings of the
kind have often been sanctioned when
there looked to be any money in it.
Jk sk %
“Cut Shot”: England has discovered
a new tennis prodigy in Cook, a Wimble-
don youth who holds the junior covered-
courts championship. Cook is 17 and
over six feet high, with more to come.
He is said to possess all the strokes and
to have a tennis head —not the swollen
variety, though that will probably de-
velop later. With Stoeffen turned pro.,
the only other giant in the game is
Rogers. McGrath and Quist will prob-
ably test the newcomer pretty thoroughly
when they meet.
Miscellaneous
“Shell”: Gone to the reward of all
good sportsmen is Bill Beach, seven times
champion professional sculler of the
world, and one who was never beaten
in a match. The kindly giant came to
Australia from Surrey as a three-year-
old and developed physique at his
father’s trade of blacksmith. He began
sculling at 17 and reached championship
class by beating Trickett in Sydney in
1884. Followed his victory over Hanlan
on the Parramatta, In those days
professional sculling occupied a fore-
most place in British and American
sport, and the news that the chap from
Botany Bay had downed the Canadian
who had revolutionised the art of sculling
dumbfounded everyone. The pair met
again in England and Australia, Beach
winning on each occasion. He retired
after his third win from Hanlan on the
Nepean River. Old Bill “never took the
public down.” It was his own phrase,
and would be a fitting epitaph. He was
84 at the end.
* * * *
V. R. Meredith, elected manager of
the 1935 All-Blacks to tour Britain, is
Crown Prosecutor at Auckland. He hails
from Onehunga, which gave the world
its first lady mayor. Meredith played
football as half-back for Wellington Pro-
vince for some years, and was sole selec-
tor of Wellington teams until he went
to Auckland. He is also a noted coach.
* * *
“Fitzcray”: Croquet is popularly sup-
posed to be confined to the social strato-
sphere where everyone moves in sur-
roundings of serene aloofness. This idea
was jolted at the international champion-
ships in Melbourne when a leading
player forgot himself so far as to claim
a foul against another. All within hear-
ing stood aghast, as they might have done
had a chess champion called his oppo-
nent a blanky cow or a contract-bridge
king accused the opposition of building
up hands from its boots. The accused
person retaliated by walking off the
ground. The accuser purposely muffed
his next stroke to make things even, and
all blew over. All the same, it was a

“James Pigg”: One of the Sydney
papers has been complaining about out-
rages suffered at the claws of cats by the
tin-hare greyhounds led about the streets
and parks by the “sports” who run them
on the tracks. At first some of these
gentry were delighted to let go the
leashes and indulge in a little run which
often ended in the destruction of some
household pet. Many of the tabbies,
however, fought back, with the result
that blinded and maimed dogs were not
unknown. One prominent dog recently
died from blood poisoning after a cat
had done with him. Now cat-coursing
has been banned. Thomas and Tibby can
claim to have scored a moral victory.

“Stadion”: It looks as if Maoriland
and Australia, old rivals in track and
field events, will resume the athletic
clashes abandoned some years ago. For
a period an Australasian gathering, held
alternately in each country, proved
very popular on both sides of the Tas-
man, until M.L. decided to break away.
Since then, save for an occasional visit
by small Australian teams to M.L. and
the coming of an All-Black side to the
Melbourne centenary meeting, the two
countries have not met in official contests.
It is proposed to revive the alternate
meetings—the first next year—but on a
smaller scale than of yore.

Arnheim Land Gold
Since The Bulletin published a con-
densed history of Arnheim Land Gold
Development, N.L., and suggested a Syd-
ney Stock Exchange inquiry (there has
been none) shares have gone up and gone
down. In the meantime, the Chief
Warden’s reports on the property have
been made available by the department.
They are extremely interesting.
The original prospectus is embellished
with a portrait of Mr, Francis Birtles,
“the Discoverer of the Reef,” and it
reprints a letter from Mr. Birtles, dated
Feb. 6, 1933, which contains these asser-
tions :
The field is entirely new, and has never
been worked by anybody but myself. Its
locality was not known to anyone until I
delivered the information under Seal to the
Promoters of this Company and subse-
quently divulged it to the Federal Authori-
ties to secure a lease of five square miles.
The warden (Mr. Norman Bell) states
that “the show” was discovered by Mr.
S. Tollis in 1920, and that he himself
reported on it officially in September,
1922. At that time only a small leader
of heavy ironstone was exposed, which
appeared to cut out at a depth about Bft.
from the surface. The ironstone “car-
ried good gold”; it gave assays which
varied from loz, 4dwt. to 7oz. fine to
the long ton. The White Hope Co. then
held an option from Mr. George Laurie.
In the following year “the show” was
inspected by Messrs. W. F. Murphy and
Shepherd. In 1924, Mr. Laurie interested
a Cairns group ; Mr. W. Colley inspected
on their behalf. On each occasion “the
show” was turned down, and it was
not taken up again till Mr. John Bailey
obtained a prospecting license over it.
Mr. Bailey and his fellow-directors
stated in the original prospectus that
they had “not hesitated to subject Mr,
Birtles’s statements to the closest scrutiny
and investigation.”
The reef has been tested, and its extent
and the assays from the lode are of a
character which would strain the credulity
of those who have not had the oppor-
tunity to verify Mr. Birtles’s statements.
The reef is of general uniformity, and its
surface richness indicates the probability
that it will be more richly gold-bearing as
it goes deeper. The ease with which the
reef can be worked makes it a most attrac-
tive proposition.
The warden does not echo these trans-
ports. He assayed samples of three dif-
ferent types of ore which Mr. Bailey
submitted to him: result, 3oz. Idwt. 6gr.,
soz. 3dwt, 17gr. and lOoz. 7dwt. lOgr.
gold, plus silver. Another sample,
“finely crushed pieces of different classes
of ore which may or may not be a repre-
sentative sample,” gave 250 z. 15dwt. bul-
lion—“probably nearly half silver.”
The warden visited the mine three
times: on Dec, 15, 1933, on March 3
and on June 24, 1934 —with Dr. Wool-
nough. On the first occasion he found
the shafts “closely and substantially tim-
bered, the workmanship a credit to those
responsible,” but “effectually preventing
an easy inspection of the lode, which was
3ft, wide on the surface” —“an average
width of 10ft. on the surface” was Mr.
Birtles’s statement in the letter published
in the original prospectus, “A rather
peculiar formation, schistose, intersected
at intervals by quartz veins which dip to
the south, and seem to resemble saddle
reefs”—such is Mr, Bell’s description
of it. *
Rain was falling and he found water
up to his knees in No. 3 shaft, which he
descended —it was 57ft. deep. All he
could see of the ore-body was 2ft. above
the water, below the timbering. Samples
were taken. The other shafts were not
accessible, and on each of his two subse-
quent visits there was too much water in
the mine to allow him to go down. On
his December 15 (1933) visit, the timber-
ing and water preventing general
sampling, the only thing to do was to
sample “the dumps of material raised to
the surface and dumped alongside the
shafts.” Mr. Bell took nine samples
which gave “rather poor results”—mini-
mum a trace, maximum 3dwt. 19gr. gold
and from a trace to 16gr. silver. The ore
round the shafts was “of low grade.”
He found “3cwt. of high-grade ore lying
in a separate paddock.” A sample of
this gave 2oz. 16dwt. gold, and one piece
of sulphide “specially broken by me”
gave soz. 18dwt.- —each with silver in
addition
The managing director, Mr. J. Bailey,
concurred in the opinion expressed by me
that the high values are in the heavy
mineral, patches of which are very small
and infrequent.
On March 3 Mr. Bell took samples
from a costeen. One assayed 2oz. lOgr.
and the other soz. 3dwt. 15gr. to the long
ton.
Though on Feb. 20, 1934, in asking
for authority to instal machinery, Mr.
John Bailey told shareholders in Syd-
ney that the mine “had 1000 tons of ore
“As head of our Vigilance Society I’m considered a holy terror.”
at grass and many thousands more wait-
ing for the battery,” on July 10, 1934, the
warden wrote:
No large quantities of ore seemed to
have been raised yet for milling, and for
my own part I would prefer to see ore at
grass sufficient to keep the stamps going
for some months before crushing begins....
There are many reefs within their five-
square-mile prospecting area waiting to
be tested, and I consider that, to avoid
waste of shareholders’ money, and to en-
sure success, testing should be immedi-
ately proceeded with.
In effect, the warden reported that
“small bodies of rich ore have been
proved to exist,” and he was evidently
impressed with the quality of the work
done on the property. But it was stated
in the original prospectus that the pro-
moters “had secured a lease from the
Federal Government,” and they had no
lease. It was asserted that “the field
was entirely new,” and it had been known
since 1920 ; asserted that Mr. Birtles “had
spent two years developing the reef” and
that his statements had been verified.
Says the warden: “Mr. Birtles’s name
has never at any time appeared in the
registers of this office as the holder of
any mining tenement of any description
in the Territory.”
Timberlands Woodpulp is the first
Maoriland forestry co. to convert its
bonds into shares, the 40,000 bonds
issued or to be issued now being replaced
by 2,200,000 £1 ords. Nominal capital
has been increased from £lOO,OOO to
£2,504,444 ; under the scheme of arrange-
ment the original shareholders were given
the right to write up their interest by
£244,444. The name of the co. hence-
forth will be Whakatane Paper Mills,
Ltd. Its Pukahunui block (41,124 acres)
has been planted, and the erection
of a 26,000-ton mill on the Matahina
property, near Rotorua, is contemplated.
Cost of this plant was estimated some
time ago at £750,000. An immediate and
economic supply of timber was con-
sidered a difficulty when the scheme was
put before bondholders in June, 1933, but
it was hoped to overcome this by the
acquisition of a large block of land al-
ready timbered. Bondholders get 55 £1
shares in exchange for each bond under
the new capital arrangement.

To protect the N.S.W. public against
misappropriation of trust funds, L 0
Martin, Minister for Justice, has intro-
duced a bill providing for the gradual
establishment of a £lOO,OOO compulsory
fidelity guarantee fund. The measure
allows for a £3 to £lO contribution pa by
every solicitor-—there are ] 647—until the
fund reaches £lOO,OOO, and solicitors must
keep trust accounts. Any practitioner with
a clean sheet, upon retiring from practice,
is to be entitled to a refund of contri-
butions, No defrauded client will be
allowed more than £2OOO out of the fund,
and the total payments on account of
any one defaulting solicitor will be
limited to £5OOO. This sum has been
sneered at by Opposition members, but
if their crowd had made a similar pro-
vision victims of scoundrelly solicitors
would not have been robbed of their all.

The sale of the 50-year-old A.M.F.
building and freehold at the corner of
Pitt and King streets, Sydney, represented
the biggest property deal in Sydney for
years. Saunders, the jewellers, bought
it for £lBO,OOO from Australian Mutual
Fire Insurance; the property, with any
other oddments of freehold the co. might
own, figured in its books at £142,771. The
A.M.F. shifted its head office from this
valuable retailer’s site many years ago
to rented premises in Dalton House,
lower down Pitt-street. A month or so
ago it moved to Ocean House, Martin-
place. The A.M.F., incidentally, is finan-
cially one of the strongest fire cos., in
proportion to its business, in the world.

Thp high cost of bankruptcy was men-
• ain the Sydney court last week ;
f° W Lloyd, official assignee, told Judge
Tutothaf “easily 25 p.c.” of an estate
L nst through forced realisations
and receivership charges. The case
mHer review was that of a country store-
eetr whose estate had paid 16s. 6d
in the £1 — an “unusual dividend, and ;

Wine exports to the U.S.A. have |
slumped. During April and May last we
hipped 47,971 gallons, valued at
fI o 757 • for the five months July-Nov.
exports amounted to only 30,454 gallons,
valued at £6923. Americans appear to
want cheap liquor, and the bootlegger
is still a factor. Also, unmatured second-
rate wines are being dumped from

Up to January 26 the sale of Austra-
lian dried fruits in London had been
promising ; almost the whole of the lexias
offered in Britain had been taken at an
average price of £2B Is. 2d. a ton, and
1479 tons of sultanas sold during the
week fetched £34 12s. 4d. Total stocks
landed and en route aggregated 4048 tons
on Jan. 26, described by the D. F. Board ;

“Electro”: Why is it that Australia
knows so much about zinc and appar-
ently so little about copper? Our extrac-
tion of zinc is equal to the world’s best;
but, while the Utah Copper Co. makes
a handsome thing out of ore containing
less than 1 p.c. of red metal, Queensland
copper propositions showing 5 p.c.
cannot be worked at a profit. Yet Ameri-
can labor, when the Utah company
started, was more costly than Australian.

“Scribe”: Next winter Melbourne
householders may have to fall back on
the wood and coal they used in bygone
days. The coalmining machinery that has
brought up the raw material from which
are made the briquettes which Melbourne
largely burns is still submerged beneath
acres of water at Yallourn, and the only
briquettes now made are from the brown
coal from old workings. As many indus-
trial concerns have altered their fur-
naces in order to use briquettes instead
of coal, they will have to be given priority
in delivery.

The Australian mills made their exis-
tence noticeable at last week’s Melbourne
wool sales. Textile manufacturers in Vic. |
and N. S. Wales often bid spiritedly for
the liner-quality fleeces, and usually get
what they want. In Melbourne the better
types of comeback and merino were in
keen demand ; Yorkshire and Japan were
well in the picture, there was occasional
Continental support, and quick clear-
ances at slightly firmer prices were the
rule. The Sydney wool-price index has
shown its first upward movement since
January, 1934 —from 107 in Dec. to 113
on Jan. 16.

From Melbourne:
Vic. Railway Department has shut down on
the agitation for widening the Flinders-street
viaduct in order to enable more trains from
the north and west to reach Flinders-street
Until the present generation, Mel-
bourne’s suburban traffic was divided on reach-
ing the city—the greater part went to Flinders-
street and the rest to Spencer-street, where
Sydney and country traffic terminates. The
people of the western suburbs kicked so hard
at being landed so far from the centre of the
city that Governments weakened and built the
viaduct to bring all the suburban traffic to
Nmders-street. Now Flinders-street station
pours out multitudes which congest the street
intersections and hold up all the traffic of Mel-
Dourne. In every other big city the railway
stations stand outside the central area and
C 'k °u tra ffi c > Melbourne lands the whole
suburban population at one point. It would be
impossible to revert to the old system now,
? ut the expected development of Melbourne
oresnadows a thorny problem for the future.

Bight to Kangaroo Point, where the span
will merge into a high viaduct. J. J. C.
Bradfield will be architect and engineer,
and tenders close on March 27. It will
spell the doom of South Brisbane wharf-
age for anything but small ships.

“Kwakprak”: A medical speaker at
the Melb. Science Congress brought out
some curious facts to show that the
suicide rate in Australia increases steadily
with north latitude. Against an Aus-
tralian average in 1933, the last year for
which figures are available, of 134 sui-
cides amongst each 10,000 deaths Tas-
mania rates 82, Vic. 107, S.A. 122,
N.S.W. 145, Q. 150 and W.A. 193. Calcu-
lated per 100,000 population, Tas. yields
eight, Vic. and S.A. 10, Q. and N.S.W.
13 and W.A. 17. Analysis of Queens-
land suicides for 1933 per 10,000 deaths
south of the tropic gave the figure at 147
in coastal areas and 168 inland. North
of the tropic, corresponding figures were
169 in the coast areas and 70 inland.
Per 100,000 population, the figures north
of the tropic were 14 on the coast and
eight inland. Whilst not quite bearing
out the speaker’s main argument, the
figures are interesting.

“Kaloa”: A question which is shak-
ing Mandated New Guinea even more
that the perennial earthquakes is whether
members of the new Leg. Council shall
be Honorables—like Leg. Councillors
down below. The august assembly, which
is mostly civil servants and about the size
of a hospital committee, already has an
ornate chamber and a “Hansard” which
would do credit to the Reichstag, but
it feels that something is lacking. Per-
haps the suffering proletariat which pays
the taxes should be thankful that its legis-
lators are not minded to declare them-
selves dukes. Dukes are even more
expensive than Honorables.

“Eck de Sulzbach”; “Say 99” (B.
23 /1 / ’35) over-emphasises the danger
of introducing malaria by aeroplane.
Malaria is established up north, and there
are, and always have been, ample oppor-
tunities for its introduction from the
Islands; yet, except in the Gulf of Car-
pentaria, it has never become the scourge
that it is in New Guinea —climatic con-
ditions and the absence of a really
efficient mosquito vector are responsible
for this happy state of affairs. However,
hygienic precautions are to be taken on
both ’planes and aerodromes. In fact,
the address of every passenger while in
Australia is to be recorded so that in
the event of one passenger falling sick
of a quarantinable disease the others may
at once be quarantined.

All the plagues of Egypt have descended
on the North. The locust has been here,
and, if boils are not prevalent, there has
been plenty of Barcoo rot. When the
monsoon rains seemed to have given the
country a miss the wet season came down
like a Siam tiger in a hurricane which
crushed houses flat around Cloncurry
and killed even the resourceful goat in
dozens. Telephone lines were knocked
flat, and the local newspaper is still look-
ing for its roof. Further south, the
weather break was gentler, but arrived
with an unprecedented escort of mos-
quitoes and sandflies.
“Notaden”: At Goondiwindi (Q.) four
horses, six calves and three foals were
found dead on the town common, all
killed by mosquitoes. Other stock were
galloping madly from tree to tree, striv-
ing to rub off clouds of the winged pests
which covered them. Three men who
tried to get them under control had to
run for safety with swollen arms and
faces. The townsfolk were living most
of the time under nets, and enough
manure-smudge fires were lit to create
a smokescreen over the town. The in-
vaders are mostly Scots Greys, largest
and most aggressive of the commoner
breeds of bloodsucking mosquito, and
stagnant stretches of water from recent
floods have provided immense breeding-
grounds. At Boggabilla, a few miles
away, things are nearly as bad, and after
a recent grasshopper invasion the inhabi-
tants are wondering what the third
plague will be.

“M. Turlutu”: Most horse-owners are
full of stories concerning the intelligence
and generous qualities of the noble
animal, but one Brisbane man admits that
his steed is either an abject idiot or a
monster of ingratitude. After slaking the
cruel thirst engendered by a heat-wave,
he boarded his cart and proceeded home-
wards, slumbering calmly. Instead of
Cannibal Chief (dreamily): “Cross out roast chicken for to-day, chef. Make
it boiled fowl instead.”
making for its comfortable stable, as it
had done many times in like circum-
stances, the moron in the shafts proceeded
to the police station and pulled up.
Attracted by resonant snores, the
guardians of the law emerged and pinched
the snorer for being drunk in charge of
a vehicle. A magistrate inflicted a fine
next day. The disillusioned horse pro-
prietor is going to get a motor-truck
now.

“Dungeness”: That description of Bill
Kendall’s hydroplane style of swimming
on top of the water (B. 23/l/’35) is curi-
ously reminiscent of Murray Island
(Torres Strait) methods. With the
islanders it is probably a matter of lower
specific gravity of the body structure
than that which prevails amongst white
men. It used to puzzle me why big-
framed, big-muscled swimboys floated so
high and buoyantly until it struck me to
weigh them. We had no scales, but,
using my own 13st. 101 b. on an impro-
vised balance, I could tip up islanders
who looked at least 2st. or more heavier.
They were not fat, either, but finely-
muscled men. It would be interesting
to get Kendall’s specific gravity worked
out —freaks must occur amongst white
men. Islanders are certainly less strong,
weight for weight, than whites.

A typical example of the off-
handedness of our Postal Department was
furnished by the last inward voyage of
the airliner Athene. She had a crossing
from Koepang which Captain Wilson
described as one which he wouldn’t have
undertaken for a million if he hadn’t
believed that Darwin would be ready with
light's and assistance. Neither was ready,
and he had to bog the machine in a
swamp. After a strenuous job of transfer
and a dangerous rush trip to Brisbane, the
mails arrived an hour after the postmen
had left on their rounds on Saturday
morning. The enterprising department,
possibly out of a spirit of kindness, kept
the adventurous mail matter for a rest
until nine on Monday morning before
sending it out for delivery.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
The one section of Sydney’s femininity
that had a spot of excitement last week
was that occupied by the Girl Guides. In
serried ranks the Guides marched on the
King’s Hall and filled it with a bright
and orderly clamor—blue bees swarming
in usefulness and kindness. When the
Queen 8.-P. arrived there was an adoring
guard of honor dressing the entrance.
She arrived with Lady Isaacs, and the
David lady made the introductory re-
marks. At this meeting Lady Baden-
Powell claimed that not only had she
been the failure of her family, but her
husband had been the failure of his. With
ears flapped back the Girl Guides lis-
tened to her every word as she traced
the building up of the Scout movement
from the first corps of boys at Mafeking.
If you want to meet the personalities
of the week go to Ihe business girls’
lunches. Almost every big store holds
one, and for a modest bob or so a nice
little meal and a guest of importance arc
served —Lady Baden-Powell, for example.
Her pleasant smile and unaffected manner
of speech sent a tidal-wave of enthusiasm
for the Guide movement sweeping
through the assembled girlhood. The girls
were delighted when, in reply to her wel-
come as a famous woman, Lady 8.-P.
remarked “I was the failure of my
family.” She added that it might have
been said in her favor that she was a
kindly soul. If that’s not modesty, what
is?
This Letter was up last week having
another look at the Archibald portraits.
The court at the National Gallery was
crowded by art lovers, by the curious and
by the general public. One young man,
with the untidy hair and tie of a budding
Augustus John, had a girl in a becoming
shade of lipstick with him. They stood
before the prize-winner, Number 34.
The young man explained that this was
the prize portrait. “Where was it drawn?”
was her question. “At his own home, I
expect,” replied her escort. “It was a
bit of luck,” said the girl; “but mustn’t
33 and 35 have felt sick!” She was
obviously under the impression that the
whole thing was an art union.
Sydney hasn’t a social compeer of the
Eton-Harrow match, at which fond
mothers and sisters parade in their finest
feathers ; but the conferring of degrees
brings out the best that is in hatbox and
wardrobe. Mothers, sisters and aunts
do the young man of the family proud,
and last week’s ceremonial dressed the
Great Hall in chiffons, muslins and silks
of the highest order. Among the ardent
applauders was Cyris McColm, her
blonde head wearing a blue lace hat, as
becoming as any halo. She and mother
were down from Queensland to see
brother Nevyl take his degree. He was
one of a company of young men as ner-
vous as debutantes in their black gowns,
the hoods of which were mostly lined
with purple.
They approached the three steps lead-
ing to the dais with a trepidation that
was born not so much of awe, it would
seem, as fear that they might stumble and
spreadeagle at the feet of the Vice-
Chancellor. One young man claimed
several degrees and also attention by
being splashed not only with purple but
with red and gold, and by wearing a
fetching flat black velvet cap. Still an-
other got an admiring glance from the
democratically-minded. He had been a
school-teacher, and threw up a job to
become a student. Now he’s a fully-
fledged resident at one of the big hos-
pitals. Five girls with brilliant records
were among the successful company.
They were Ann Fraser Thompson, Jean
Edelsten Pope, Pauline Baillie-Newton,
Doris Skyring and Faith Phair.
Mayoress Parker’s first party of the
year was in compliment to the aider-
men and their wives and city depart-
mental heads. The long reception-room
was sprinkled with men and women, and
as usual man seemed to gravitate to man.
Alderman O’Dea talked to the hostess,
whose chiffons were patterned in del-
phinium blues, and whose wide white
hat was banded in black velvet. They
talked of cocktails, the Archibald prize
and Sevres china, and near by a bowl
of red and brown zinnias stood to atten-
tion. Mrs. O’Dea, who wore a pink
blouse with her brown suit, and the wife
of Alderman Carroll discussed the
Gordon Esling painting “Broughton
Vale,” just given to the council by the
Rodney Dangars. The Town Clerkly
Hendys were there, and Frank Crane
and Hazel Wedlock helped circulate the
guests. Ivy Brown and Margaret Black-
burn were responsible for seductive
music, old and new.
Going to the dentist mightn’t be such
a hardship if the holders of all forceps
were as attractive as Joan Katherine
Bates, who gained her degree in dental
surgery the other day—the only woman
of her year to graduate in the faculty.
She is the youngest of the three daugh-
ters of the Percy Bates couple ; and these
Strathfield girls have brilliant academic
records. One practises medicine in Bris-
bane ; another is on the staff of the Tam-
worth High School. At the week-end
Joan sailed for England and Europe. A
Desmond Woolley camera caught the
glimpse.
They have made a corner in Mayor-
esses in the Town Hall. Instead of
hanging here and there about the walls
of the reception-room, dispensing their
smiles from various points, all the
“formers” are in a right-angled niche at
the very top end of the room, beyond
the last archway, and behind the piano.
The tapestry chairs, however, are still in
the foreground.
The demon rum, or rather its social
expression the cocktail, had some hard
words thrown at it last week. The
W.C.T.U. sounded the tocsin, and the
Chapter House was bang full of women
(there were a few men in a back row)
to hear the giddy little drink tried and
convicted by Canon Hammond, Dr.
Brodie Grant and Mrs. W. Strang. The
oyster cocktail this Letter had swallowed
for lunch was quite restive: “That’s
right; give a dog a bad name! ” it
grumbled. But, of course, it wasn’t the
innocent of the species the gathering was
condemning. It was its gay sisters, all
sparkling with vermouth and absinthe
and gin.
When Canon Hammond read out that
one definition for cocktail was “a racer,
not a thoroughbred,” there was a little
gentle derisive laughter from the rows of
earnest listeners. There was some more
when he referred to the cocktail party as
a sort of stepping-stone for the social
climber. But cocktail parties aren’t all
as gay as they seem. There are cock-
tail parties one has known where the
ration seems to be one thimbleful of
gin to two gallons of orange-juice. There
are others where the mixture looks like
olive oil and tastes like furniture varnish.
One quickly-drained glass, and even the
addict would run shuddering for sanc-
tuary to the W.C.T.U. When, however,
Canon Hammond speaks with the con-
viction of experience of the pitfalls of
drink to the young woman, even your
hardened two-or-three-cherry girl must
be jarred to attention. He had never
met any man with the bail or fine money
for his woman companion taken in
drunkenness.
The party that his artist friends gave
to Archibald prize winner Harry Hanke
lasted till 3 a.m. The dance was pre-
ceded by a dinner, and the big dining-
room at Pfahlert’s was set with long tables,
yellowy-pink with half-moons of rock-
melon and gay with flowers. Around
the walls hung paintings by pupils of J.
S. Watkins, who has acted as guide and
friend to the little artist with the eyes
like amber pools and a will like a steel
drill. Tall Eric Langker was there to
prove how like he was to his portrait
painted by Hanke. With him was his
wife, in black and silver. J. S. Watkins
sat beside his clever pupil, and near by
Mrs. Hanke, in leaf-like browns, smiled
a trifle tremulously. The menus were
ornamented with caricatures by Frith
and Will Mahony. Mrs. Milson, in
black tulle, and contralto Eileen Boyd
supplied the music.
Here is Rita Miller, just back from
Paris and London. In London she saw
a good deal of John Brownlee (of whose
Australian concert company she was a
member), Mrs. Brownlee and Donald
John, the baritone’s infant son and heir.
The Australian singer was giving her
coloratura soprano a holiday when in
Paris, so her thoughts turned to hats ;
and here is one of her tips. If you want
to have that direct-from-Paris look, don’t
wear your plateau beret tipped over one
eye. Wear it straight on the head, show-
ing a good deal of the forehead. Miss
Miller, who has just completed an
operatic season in Berne, will next week
commence a series of broadcast recitals
in conjunction with pianist Raymond
Lambert.
With the approach of Easter comes
the usual crop of engagement announce-
ments. Last week’s social flutter was
caused by Elizabeth Macarthur Onslow
and Pat (F. L.) Rothe publishing their in-
tentions with regard to matrimony. Eliza-
beth is the younger daughter of General
Macarthur Onslow, of Camden Park,
where all visiting royalties spend a week-
end. Her betrothed is a kinsman, being
a descendant of Hannibal Macarthur,
of Parramatta. Miss Macarthur Onslow is
a great horsewoman, and always rides
side-saddle in the English way. When in
England, where her sister, the wife of
Major Stanham, has her home, she hunts
a good deal. It will be remembered
that Major Stanham, then Captain Stan-
ham, was A.D.C. to the late Sir Walter
Davidson.
Mary Page, daughter of Deputy-Pri-
minister Earle Page, is another of the
newly-engaged. Her ring-giver is Wil-
fred Bailey Tart, of Cremorne and
Stoke-on-Trent (England).
In the basement of Radio House you
can sip a cup of tea surrounded by the
most travel-luring posters. Here they are,
scenes from many lands. If you drink
Indian tea your eye can be ravished with
glittering temple, with jungle giants. If
China is your brew, you can glimpse the
glories of old Pekin. There Rheims
Cathedral towers; there the belfry of
Bruges. From one panel the lacemaker
of Le Puy looks out, her expression as
enigmatic as Mona Lisa’s. A. E. Martin,
well known as publicity man for J. C.
Williamson for many years, and his
friend Baker are the gleaners of the col-
lection.
The Chief Scout, the Chief Guide and
Betty and Heather Baden-Powell went
off, Vancouver way, by the Aorangi,
after revelling in campfires (both Guide
and Scout). The kookaburra call which
split the air from 1500 Girl Guides and
Brownies in greeting to her is no doubt
still ringing in Lady Baden-Powell’s ears.
Glengarry, the Guide camp up Turra-
murra way, evoked her deep admiration.
There are 40 acres of bushland around
the hut, rich in flowering gums and our
shy native flora. But what would she
have said to the conversation of two of
her blue-clothed band the morning camp
was struck? “Won’t it be nice,” said
Number One, “to eat a dinner you
haven’t helped to cook?” “Um-m,” said
Number Two, “and no washing-up to
do!” Occasionally Lady 8.-P. did get
away from the campfire element in her
parties. One was set for her in the Mac-
quarie Club by Miss Egan ; and another
in the Australia by Miss Kelso King and
Miss E. Smith. The Commonwealth Gov-
ernor’s lady was present at both.
Bridge-builder Bradfield had a wedding
in his family last week, when son Alan
John married his Sheila Mitchell in the
chapel of the C. of E. Grammar School.
Rhodes scholar brother Keith Bradfield
best-manned, and sister Shirley ’maided
in flowered blue marocain. Pink lilies
cascaded against the bride’s forget-me-
not-blue frock. A family reception in the
Mitchell home at Lindfield rounded off
the quiet nuptials.
Interesting arrivals by the Otranto
were Sir Archibald and Lady Edmon-
stone. Sir Archibald, who was Groom-
in-Waiting to King Edward VIL, is a
brother to Mrs. George Keppel, one of
the famous beauties of the ’nineties. This
lady, who now spends most of her life in
Florence, has retained her looks, even in
age. Lady Edmonstone was in Australia
10 years ago, and then stayed with the
vice-regal De Chairs, and, in Melbourne,
with the Stradbrokes. The Edmonstones
are going on to Maoriland. So are Sir
Godfrey and Lady Dalrymple White,
other Otranto arrivals. He has been for
22 years M.P. for Southport in Lanca-
shire. Maybe on the world tour he is
enjoying he may help to form some plan

shire whirring back to prosperity.
Overheard on the ferry: “And I said
to her: ‘You ain’t nothing but a cuckoo
in the nest, cornin’ to the dance without
a partner and then dancing with me
cousin’s boy all night.’ ” “Oh, no, I’m
not complaining. I’ve got my own teeth,
and I can read without glasses and I’m
not deaf, although I’m 84. Still, I’m not
as agile as I used to be!” “I’m going
away for the week-end. I lost my job
yesterday. It’s tough, isn’t it, the very
week Jim broke off our engagement!
So I’m going away for the week-end.”

Melbourne
Chatter
Until rain drove them homeward
many people prolonged their stay at Sor-
rento which commenced with the A.N.A.
week-end. Attractions were golf, surf-
ing at the back beach and swimming in
the clear, sheltered water of the bay.
The links were in excellent nick for the
Sorrento championships, and players
had every opportunity of bringing in
low scores. The associates’ champion-
ship was fought out by two English-
women, Mrs. W. S. Robinson and Mrs.
W. S. Bradshaw. Mrs. Robinson’s 78
won the trophy, for Mrs. Bradshaw, who
produced a card with a 77, is not a
member. With Pat Newbigin, Mrs.
Robinson also tied for first place in the
handicap. The lan Baillieus won the
mixed foursomes. Lord Huntingfield
played in the handicap, his partner being
A. F. Hiskens, who has been club cap-
tain since 1908.
At the conclusion of the week-end
play Mr. and Mrs. Robert Wilkins enter-
tained at the president’s tea in the club-
house, decorated for the occasion with
pink and blue hydrangeas. Mrs. Wilkins
was all in cedar-brown, with an astrin-
gent of bronze, orange and tomato stripes
at the neck. Her daughter-in-law, Mrs.
Robin Wilkins, wore pale biscuit linen-
tweed, with a scarf of bright marquee
stripes. Nearly all the women competi-
tors wore skirts of linen or linen-tweed,
with navy-blue or check blouses. Men’s
fashions became much more hilarious
than they were at the centenary cham-
pionships. One man wore a bright green
shirt, and another managed to complete
his round in a sunburst-yellow jumper
and a wide Mexican hat of twisted straw.
Visiting Melbourne are Mr. and Mrs.
R. P. Butchart, of Victoria, British
Columbia. Their home is a long,
rambling bungalow situated in 27 acres
of world-famous garden, Benvenuto,
open to the public every day of the year.
Benvenuto has tall trees and natural bush-
land, an Italian garden, a Japanese garden
and rose and delphinium grottos. Tulips
grow profusely, and English trees
flourish.
Thirty-five years ago Mr. and Mrs.
Butchart travelled west from Toronto.
They built a three-roomed cottage in
what was then a lonely wilderness ; the
wild deer roamed within sight of their
door. A quarry was cut (Mr. Butchart
was interested in the manufacture of
cement) and on its floor a pool formed
from a tiny spring. Mrs. Butchart
stocked the pool with trout and planted
a few seedlings, which thrived in the
climate she thought so mild after the
rigorous winters of Ontario. The old
quarry was the beginning of the sunken
garden, which has excited the admiration
of royalty and has given pleasure to
people in all walks of life. The
property slopes down to the sea, where
in a protected cove is Mr. Butchart’s
motor-launch.
When Mr. and Mrs. Butchart went
round the world on the Franconia, the
liner called at Sydney. They are now-
bound for Java, and made a deviation to
Australia to see Melbourne and to spend
another short week or two in Sydney.
They praise our gardens, our buildings,
our scenery. Small courtesies and the
friendliness of the Australians give im-
mense pleasure to these Canadians.
Mrs. Butchart tells an amusing story
of the overland trip which she and her
husband made from Cairo to . the Cape.
The journey by river boat, train and car
lasted five months. On one occasion they
accepted an invitation to lunch with an
Englishwoman in her lonely jungle home
while the river steamer was in port. The
hostess apologised for the trampled, un-
tidy condition of her garden: “It’s Her-
bert ; he does this every night.” For a
moment Mrs. Butchart visualised an in-
ebriated husband rolling upon the plants
and shrubs. But Herbert was a hippo,
who came out of the jungle every day at
sunset and wouldn’t go away until he
was given a bucket of native-brewed ale.
The brightest spots of color on the
second day of the centenary athletic
meeting were provided by L. C. McLach-
lan’s woolly warmers and the Boy Scouts
from Nauru. These boys, in their scarlet
scarves and lava-lavas, with white shirts
and stiff black hair, sat like a row of
brightly-colored birds along one seat in
the stand. They huddled closer and
closer together, for there was a chill
breeze blowing. At last, when they
moved to another stand where there was
more sun, they gave up all pretence of
watching the sports and showed far more
interest in a cruising aeroplane and in the
colored advertisements suspended by
kites. McLachlan’s get-up was of bright
crimson, made according to the prevail-
ing fashion for athletic competitors. The
jumper is baggy, with long sleeves ; the
trousers are tight-fitting below the knees,
with zip-fasteners up the sides of the
breeze-proof ankles. These protection
suits are pulled on after every jump, race
or javelin-throw, and only come off at
the last minute. G. L. Rampling (Britain)
is a well-groomed youth with sleek hair.
His countryman, R. M. Craske, is tall,
fair and “very English” ; his woollies are
cream, and his jumper is knitted in cable-
stitch, which never seems to go out of
fashion for men’s apparel. One man
pranced about before his event in the
most hectic shade of emerald-green from
top to toe. The Finnish pair, Matti Sip-
pala and V. Perasalo, wore navy-blue
woollies with “Suomi” embroidered on
the jumpers. Sippala had a grin for the
small boys who buzzed around him with
autograph books like persistent little
sandflies. Expectant faces turned up-
wards at an uncomfortable angle towards
the high dressing-room window per-
suaded Perasalo to reach through the
fanlight for autograph books and pencils.
The smile caught by a Broothorn lens
belongs to Winifred Wales, only daughter
of Melbourne’s Mayor and Mayoress.
Miss Wales is a great help to her mother
in her civic responsibilities. She’s an old
girl of C. of E. Grammar School, has a
taste for music and has never let her
piano become just an ornamental piece
of furniture. Her wedding with Lem
Callaway will take place this year.
To give representatives of the League
of Nations Union and the Bureau of
International Affairs an opportunity of
meeting Dr. J. B. Condliffe, Mr. and Mrs.
Edward Dyason had a reception at
Menzies,- A stream of guests arriving
between 5 and 6 p.m. was escorted to the
large private dining-room, where buffet
tables and pedestals were laden with
flowers, a clump of greenery made a
grotto at the foot of the stairs, and pink
carnations and sprays of delphiniums
were massed in baskets hewn from blocks
of ice. Mrs. Dyason wore black crepe
with a spray of white flowers upon the
shoulder and a V insertion of Limerick
lace in the corsage. The Dowager Lady
Swaythling wore pastel-tinted chiffon
striped diagonally with black.
Dr. Condliffe is stationed in Geneva
as editor of the Economic Review of the
League of Nations. His wife and family
are at present visiting M.L., his native
country. He will collect them there before
returning to Geneva at the end of his
leave. Dr. Condliffe has spent a con-
siderable time in Honolulu in connection
with the Institute of Pacific Relations,
and has made several visits to China.
Among his greatest friends there are
writer Pearl Buck and her husband, who
conducts the offices of the Agricultural
Survey. Mrs. Buck’s understanding of
the Chinese comes fron\a lifetime spent
among them. She was born of mission-
ary parents.
Peninsula and Cooronwarabul women’s
polo teams were so evenly matched when
they met last week at Mt. Eliza that an
extra chukka had to be played. The
result was that Peninsula had a win
through the fast work of Mary Bright
and Lynette Dunstan. Their team-mates
were Mary Hope Campbell and Norme
Collins, and the visitors were Mrs.
C. A. S. Mansbridge, Geraldine Penny-
father, Helen Good and Gwen Stead.
Onlookers in cars expressed their appro-
bation in the usual manner per toot of
horns.
Here is an Esler portrait of Noel, only
child of the Commissioner for Railways
and Mrs. Harold Clapp. Miss Clapp has
shown aptitude for the stage, and has
taken jobs as mannequin and sales-
woman. At present her Titian head is
a-whirl with plans of trousseau, furniture
and furnishings. She and her fiance, Dr.
Geoffrey Smith, are building a commodi-
ous and unusual house in Toorak.
The staff of the Y.W.C.A., with
newly-appointed general sec. Elsie Hardie
at the head of the table, drank a pot of
tea in honor of Millicent Jones, who has
been general sec. for the last 18 months.
Miss Jones was presented with a posy
which ornamented her lapel when she
boarded the Sydney express. She is off
to Newcastle as area sec. for the New-
castle and Hunter districts, N.S.W. The
Y.W, has grown so sturdily that it can
now extend its activities to rural zones.
On a cloud of white and gold Audrey
Sprague and her ’maids swept up the
aisle of All Saints’, Geelong, where Cap-
tain Felix Lionel Edge waited to claim
his bride. The wedding garment of pale-
apricot satin, shot with threads of gold
lame, was fashioned with long sleeves,
a low cowl neck into which was tucked
a spray of orange-blossom worn by
mother at her wedding, and an elonga-
tion of train. A bouquet of sweet-
scented frangipanni was carried. Zelma
Sprague, Edith Cooke and Margaret
Cummmg wore loquat-yellow chiffon,
swathed with simplicity at the front but
frilled and fluttersome in the wake of
their spindle-heeled sandals. Their chif-
fon veils were adjusted with posies of
hydrangea petals, and they carried deep-
cream roses and hydrangeas to echo the
blue of their diaphanous sashes. There
was dancing at Gharlemont, the home of
the bride’s parents, after the cake had
been cut under a marquee upon the lawn.
Accompanied by her mother, and with
her wedding gown and trousseau folded
among layers of tissue and sprigs of
lavender, Nan Osment boarded the
Ormonde. Her destination is Colombo,
where Howard Clayton-Daubery waits
to slip a ring upon her finger. A few
days before trunks were locked and
labelled Mrs. Arthur Osment gave a late-
afternoon party at Kyalite House,
Toorak. Her gown was of white-and-
blue rippled crepe, and her daughter wore
white sprigged with bronze, with kilted
edgings upon skirt and sleeves. Sharing
in her good-byes were Mr. and Mrs.
Atlee Hunt and Mollie, Peggy Fullarton,
the Alan Stuarts, Bonnie Kennedy,
Clifford and Peggy Sawrey. With Mary
Guy Smith the hostess exchanged only an
au revoir, for Miss Smith was also a pas-
senger in the Ormonde.
Entries close on February 18 for the
exhibition of handicraft competitions to
be held in the Braille Hall, Commercial-
road. There are special competitions for
blind people, but the majority of sections
are open to workers with eyesight. Rug-
makers may enter short-pile exhibits and
hooked rugs made on hessian or canvas.
Expert knitters will produce men’s socks,
dolls dressed in woollies, etc., and skilled
needlewomen may choose several sec-
tions, including tapestry and cross-stitch
designs for pictures, footstools, cushions,
firescreens and wallets. There are spaces"
reserved for gloves of skin or material,
pottery, basketware and toys of stuffed
flannel or crochet. Articles marked “For
Sale” are subjected to a 20 p.c. levy for
the Braille Library funds.
Librarian Miss M. Crabb. who is hon.
freas. of the Braille Centenary Council, is
off to England in April. Her trip is really
intended as a holiday, but she is taking
with her plans and pictures of the Braille
printing press, the dual invention of her-
self and an engineer, H. Hulme. In the
library the machine is an enormous help
in printing magazines, programmes, cir-
culars, etc., for when the type is set up
as many as 100 copies can be printed
from one plate. Time spent and the cost
of paper do not warrant the machine
being used for the translating of books
into Braille, for one copy of each book
is sufficient in the library. Several blind
people can, for instance, read at the same
time “The Hunchback of Notre Dame,”
for when written in Braille this book
runs to 14 heavy volumes. An average
Dickens novel occupies a whole shelf
of 28 volumes.
In the lower regions of Newspaper
House there has sprung up overnight a
cotton-tree, its branches covered with
large white puffballs. The tree, which
has been treated with tender care since
its arrival from the North, is part of the
Queensland Exhibition, where cotton is
to be seen at all stages, from raw pro-
ducts to completed articles of clothing.
In the peanut section there are all
sorts of chopped and colored nuts used
for cake decoration. Among the sugars,
from cane to castor and crystals, are
glass jars of nearly black molasses, golden
syrup and a colorless liquid which, when
a jar was upset, produced fumes strong
enough to put a metho.-drinker on his
ear. Among the woods are red-tulip
floorings inlaid with silver-ash, and some
panelling and furniture of silky-oak
which can be finished in any shade.
Sister Hilda? Davies is the first nurse
to take advantage of the Health Depart-
ment’s scheme for the interchange of
nurses with M.L. She sailed on the
Monowai for Wellington, where she will
spend six months at St. Helen’s Obstetri-
cal Hospital. Sister Aileen Joyce, who
for 18 months has been sub-matron of
St. Helen’s, will commence her duties at
the Melbourne Women’s in February.
The exchange of nurses is a new arrange-
ment, but for several years M.L. doctors
who have gained scholarships in obstet-
rics have been able to spend six months
at the Women’s before proceeding to
England for further study.
On her Australian trip the Dowager
Lady Swaythling has considerably aug-
mented her luggage with masses of manu-
script and photographs, for she keeps
a pictorial record of every place she visits.
Lady Swaythling has a vivid personality,
and is interested in peoples, customs, in-
dustries and international relationships.
She has visited our butter factories and
discussed the pasteurisation of milk with
dairy experts. She enjoys Australian
fruits, and while walking along the street
has a backward glance of admiration for
fruit-stall displays, which changes to a
shake of the head at the thought of the
bad management which puts damaged
Australian fruits on the London market.
Lady Swaythling knows the difference
between a volt and an ampere and is
handy with a screwdriver when an elec-
tric connection fuses, for she is a member
of the Electrical Association of Women
established in London to interest women
in the correct use of electricity in the
home. Its 200 members hold household
diplomas which qualify them to demon-
strate electric apparatus used for domestic
purposes. Lady Swaythling is also a
member of the Royal Geographic Society
and of the Air League of the British
Empire. She has made several flights
with her friend Lord Sempill.

Mrs. Carlyle Smythe and Mrs. Steinle,
travelling through Manchuria, came face
to face with a rusty implement of war
from which swung a notice in several
languages: “When this gun was fired
the Russians ran away terror-stricken.”
Its muzzle, filled with colonies of spiders,
is pointed harmlessly on Port Arthur,
Mrs. Smythe says that in Manchuria is
to be found the finest train throughout
Eastern Asia. It’s a streamlined affair fitted
with beautiful woods, swivel seats (so
that one may swing to suit the scenery)
a nd a library. Manchurian hotels are up
to date, with hot and cold water laid on
i n every room. In the summer a per-
centage of the population cleans and
sharpens its weapons and goes a-bandit-
ing. During the winter footsteps are seen
i n the snow, so the bandits bury their
weapons and plunder, and go off to earn
their rice by a spot of more or less honest
toil. But the profession is dying out, for
bandits are being absorbed by jobs of
W ork.
There is a newspaper published in
English at Dairen. It contains few
mistakes, though its type is set up
and proofs are read by Japanese
w h o know no English. They do
their tedious work letter by letter,
The editor-manager, an Englishman, en-
tertained Mrs. Smythe and Mrs. Steinle
w ith cups of tea and an inspection of
the draughty newspaper offices,
xhe travellers were astonished at the
modern equipment of Eastern Asiatic
hospitals. Patients who lose an appendix
or an y other spare part in the hospital
a t Mukden know that the job will be
P erformed by the light of shadowless
l a mps. The Melbourne pair had another
surprise in Japan when, attending a royal
garden party at the Imperial Palace, they
were presented to the Emperor and Em-
press, who were clad, like the other guests,
in Western clothes. Tea with sandwiches
and cakes tasted much the same as it
would at a garden party in Australia,
At most functions in Japan European
food was served, and when the travellers
were alone in cafes and trains they usu-
ally managed to get enough to eat,
though it was difficult to escape raw fish.
THE LITTLE SISTERS.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
We are still experiencing autumn
weather and wearing tailor-mades and
furs. It is feared that our summer is
waiting until winter things are showing
in the shops. Of course, in sheer despera-
tion the women who have smart summer
frocks insist upon wearing them, even
if they have to ultimately cover them
with a marocain coat.
Mrs. L Terry-Grant and her sister.
Miss A. Terry, of Glenelg, were given a
farewell party at the South Australian
Hotel by Mrs. Michael Magar on the
eve of their departure for England in the
Ormonde, About 25 guests were present.
The manager of the Orient Line and
the commander of the R.M.S. Orontes
have issued invitations for a dance and
bridge party to be held on board on
Saturday, February 23. These dances
are always very popular.
Mrs. Malcolm F. Murray, wife of
Eastern Extension’s manager at Singa-
pore, and daughter Judith have returned
from Melbourne, where they were visit-
ing relatives of Mr. Murray. They are
now the guests of Mrs. Murray’s mother,
Mrs. R. Davies-Hanson, at St. Peters.
Mrs. Murray will place her daughter at
school in Adelaide before rejoining her
husband at Singapore.
Mrs. P. R. Crompton and her daugh-
ter entertained a dinner party of 30 at
the Hotel Richmond prior to leaving
for their home in London.
Adelaide should be well represented at
the King’s jubilee. Starting this month,
every outgoing liner will carry a con-
tingent of tourists. Mrs. Guy Makin,
the Frank Forwoods and Miss B. For-
wood, Mrs. H. K. Wendt and Lois, Abe
Shannon, the Albyn Rankines, Mr. and
Mrs. J. H. Gosse and family, Mrs. C. L.
Jessop and Monica and Legh Winser and
his daughters will all leave before the
end of March.
WESTRALIA.
Bunbury tennis week-end was a burst
of gaiety from start to finish. Hordes
from the city and sou]-west poured into
the port, played tennis and swam and
danced with the maximum of vim. The
culminating effort was the dance in the
Bedford Hall, where swayed a canopy
of streamers and colored lights. Molly
McGrath discarded her shorts for dusty-
pink flat crepe billowing with white
organdie ; Margaret Drummond’s misty-
blue voiles were scattered with flowers
of a deeper shade ; Dorothy Wilson’s old-
gold elephant-skin was harnessed with a
halter and reins of black velvet; glitter-
ing diamente shone on Gwen Brazier’s
black georgettes ; amethyst lace was Mrs.
Alan Thompson’s happy choice, and Mrs.
Herbert Davies danced in a snowy con-
fection of white georgette.
Cissie D’Arcy was “crowned” in the
Embassy ballroom. Three attendant
“queens,” Pat Ryan, Gwen Dono-
van and Cath Davies, white-satin-
clad, with their respective retinues in
apricot, red and green, advanced fan-
wise to the dais, following the
plumed pages who carried the crown
and sceptre. Then came the royal pro-
cession, with the queen’s train held by
two pages in satin marocain of the same
Madonna-blue as that worn by her ladies-
in-waiting. Lord High Chancellor Stan
O’Brien read a petition, and after the
coronation the “queen” joined in the
dancing. .
The Little Theatre ran a four-night
season of the prize-winning one-act plays
in its recent competition. Phyllis
Tweedie’s “Many Mansions” went back
to the time of the Inquisition, with Aileen
Lowe, Joy Seymour, Maurice Le Courtoir,
Lawrence Hunter and Ronald Newton as
Spaniards. “The Waiting Room,” by
Philip Masel, depicted a scene on a rail-
way station, and A. W. Darbyshire’s two
plays, “Leaden Logic” and “Parallels
Meet,” travelled far for their settings, the
first to Germany and the second to a
mythical island. ,
For her marriage to R. T. Williams at
St. Alban’s Church Gwen Hawkes moored
her floating tulle veil with a coronet of
silver lame and seed pearls. Cowled
magnolia satin merged into tiers of tulle
cascading into a frothy train, balanced
in the front by the long floral trails
which fell from the spider-lily bouquet.
Marjorie Harrison stood by with flame
gladioli held against her floral-green
georgettes.
TASMANIA.
Throngs went by car, ’bus or Shanks's
pony to the switching on of the electric
illuminations of Ferntree Bower, Mt.
Wellington. The Governor, who was
accompanied by Lady Clark, pressed the
button, and, though some people con-
sidered it an invasion of the quiet and dig-
nified silence and darkness of the spot, the
lighting produced some beautiful effects.
Mrs. Tom Murdoch gave a luncheon
party in honor of the Eccles Snowden
lady at her own home. The table was
decked with yellow nasturtiums and blue-
bells in two shades, with touches of pale-
pink scabious, all arranged in low crystal
bowls. Lady Clark was present; also
Mungo MacCallum’s lady (Sydney), Mrs.
C. W. Grant and daughter Keir.
The Lady Mayoress issued many invi-
tations to an at-home in the Town Hall
to welcome former Agent-General Snow-
den’s lady back to the Speck. Dahlias in
many shades glowed in crystal bowls and
in the deep niches of the windows. Lady
Clark was in a brown turnout, the
hostess in black georgette. The guest of
honor wore black-and-white-striped voile
and a big black picture hat. Music fol-
lowed the ceremonious addresses and
replies, and there was an opportunity for
the guests to mingle and greet the
returnee.
The Amateur Horticultural Soc., find-
ing its funds low, has organised a bridge
club. The first session of play was at
the Continental, and Lady Clark was
among the guests. Quite a big crowd
turned up, and the society’s funds got a
needed fillip.
Mrs. Frank Piesse, president of
Hobart’s N.C.W., poured morning-tea at
Hadley’s in honor of the Brisbane presi-
dent, Mrs. Cumbrae-Stewart. The
Lady Mayoress and most of the brass-
hats of the Hobart association were
present, and the tea-table blushed pinkly
under floral decorations and china in
rosy shades.
Mrs. Thos. Murdoch followed up the
welcome to Mrs. Cumbrae Stewart with
a drawing-room meeting, at which the
visitor gave an account of N.C.W. work
in the northern capital. Miss Gillman-
Jones (Melb.) spoke of the Invergowrie
Homecraft Hostel in Victoria, and youth-
ful Jean Snowden fluttered fledgling wings
of oratory in an account of the school
of domestic science at which she studied
for two years in the Cold Country.
The show held in Friends’ School
grounds in aid of the S.P.C.A. was a huge
success, and possibly even the animals
taking part enjoyed it. Mrs. W. B. Prop-
sting, complete with cowman’s smock and
flat, led her two small cows in the parade,
and the fancy-dress class for dogs caused
many chuckles. Mrs. W. Roberts got
the prize for the most original pet—a
stump-tailed lizard which she has
domesticated. Tea and sideshows helped
rake in the nimble sixpence. Lady Clark
opened the function.

One of these
days there will
arise an art critic
courageous
enough to de-
bu n k the old
masters —or some of them. To-day,
writers on art subjects approach the
works of the dead ’uns controlled by
Bacon’s “phantoms of the market-
place,” the phantoms of convention.
Burnto Umberto has always been re-
garded as a Great Florentine, therefore
he must be a Great Florentine. His
work may be ill-drawn, his colors muddy,
his composition inferior to that of the
designer of the cheaper class of jam
labels. But for centuries he has been
acclaimed one of the Great Florentines,
and therefore the critic undergoes the
process popularly known as “kidding
himself” —and incidentally kidding the
public.
Let us consider the history of some of
the old masters which have reached Aus-
tralia in recent years. Some enterprising
Babbitt in London spends a cool thou-
sand on Burnto Umberto’s picture of
Zophar the Naamathite chiding Job.
This picture is world-famous. That is
to say, it has been in the possession of
the Bilgewater family since the original
Viscount Bilgewater acquired it in 1683,
and, though only the successive viscounts
and their families and their brothers and
their guests and a few critics—some hun-
dreds altogether—have ever seen the pic-
ture, its greatness has become part of
Little Arthur’s History of England.
Having failed fo impress the National
Gallery of England, the Louvre in Paris,
the Metropolitan Museum of New York,
Mr. Pierpont Morgan and others, the
dealer, perspiring lest his thousand may

in Egyptian darkness ever since Cook

picture from the brush of the Great Flor-

urging the immediate purchase of this
Tnighty work appear in the press signed
by local Babbitts who have acquired,
and wish to retain, a reputation as con-
Eoisseurs. Finally, some editor takes
otice and tells his leader-writer to advo-
cate the acquisition of some picture
or other by some Italian or other ; he
can get the names out of the files. The
article appears, cables flash across the
world, and finally it is announced that
the Felton Bequest has secured this
unique work for the modest sum of
£2500.
Other London Babbitts—people who
have gentlemen’s agreements with the
first Babbitt —rain congratulations on the
Bequest trustees for their acumen, their
shrewdness, their uncanny judgment, and
the picture comes out to Australia. It
proves to be the same sort of picture as

public and the art critics and the artists
who have not already committed them-
selves can’t see any difference between
this old master and any other old master.
Like the rest, it is a large canvas, mostly
brown —dark brown melting into light
brown—and through the fog of browns
may be discerned a couple of male
figures well drawn—as well drawn as

them—with their flesh ghastly white and
their faces conveying absolutely nothing.

their previous decisions.
There the matter ends. The public
strolls past the picture and halts in front
of some modern work. The local artists
and students stay a few minutes and try
to ascertain what all the fuss was about
and why the liars, executors and assigns
of a man 300 years dead should be
taking the bread out of honest workers’
mouths. Like the rest, they’re too scared
to say it out loud, but they think it —
and think it hard.

Hostile Mountain.
Here is the patient hostility of rock,
And water calls with a cold voice, like
iron
That drops with a hushed clang down
glades of ice.
Old stone is angry, the dead volcano
Holds something of stubborn hatred even
yet;
Or why do men who have climbed the
sour ridges
Feel such a need for gossip on returning,
Such desperate need for the warmth of
human words;
Why do the fools with kodaks hang hack
from the canyons.
Afraid that invisible hands will push
them over ?
Here wind is assassin; but greater evil
Lies in wait beneath the slopes that
glisten —
Or why do the girls who sport amongst
the snow
Suddenly pause . . . and listen . . .
And men on the ski-ground shout falsely
loud, and laugh
With a hollow sound the crags toss to
and fro ?

Education
By Talkie
Drummond, N.
S. Wales Min-
ister for Educa-
tion, referred re-
cently to a film
dealing with
Cleopatra VIL, Queen of Egypt, as pos-
sessed of noticeable merit, and urged
secondary school-children to see it.
Apparently the honorable Minister, like
so many of these politicians and others
who urge us to view certain films for
education’s sake, saw some historical
worth in this masterpiece of misinterpre-
tation.
Historically, as an instructive lesson,
it is hopelessly incorrect. The facts are
contusing and the characters portrayed
are weak and indefinite. Julius Caesar
(according to De Mille), with his ample
crop of hair and Greek features, may
have been an erratic celebrity of no par-
ticular period whatever. Cleopatra, with
her modern accent and twentieth-century
phrases, was as farcical as her velvet
gown—velvet being a material not known
till its manufacture at Lucca in 1277.
Anyhow, she was a Macedonian Greek,
and fair.
Augustus (or rather Octavian, a youth
of 20 at this time) acted all through the
piece rather like a sulky boy than the
somewhat cunning future ruler of the
world. A score of such abuses could be
quoted, including this one (an interesting
question which might be asked of pupils)
—why Cleopatra allowed the asp to bite
her before Octavian had taken her
prisoner and placed a guard at the door
to prevent her from obtaining poison?
Perhaps Mr. Drummond could tell them
—if it matters much.
E. W.
Art and the
Arty-Crafty
Duncan Mac-
D o u g a 11 (B.
23/l/’35) is vastly
entertaining, even
if, in replying to
my article “An
Old Art Goes By,” he is singularly un-
convincing.
As one who claims to have studied
the theatre, and who blithely throws
about accusations of factual error, Mr.
MacDougall should be more careful.
Seeking to prove that the Elizabethan-
Jacobean theatre was “intellectual and
fashionable ; above all, intellectual,” he
states that the stage had “buf lately
emerged from the wing of the Church.”
The miracle and mystery plays were
developed by the Church, but by the year
1300 they were virtually out of ecclesias-
tical hands and controlled by the town
guilds, each guild being responsible for
one or more of the series and carefully
selecting and training the actors. This
took place two and a half to three cen-
turies before the Elizabethan drama was
born. The plays as performed in this
way were immensely popular with “the
mob,” and if, on the appearance of the
Elizabethan dramatists, they commenced
to disappear, it may easily be assumed
that their audiences had transferred
allegiance to the new form of entertain-
ment.
To suggest that the Elizabethan play-
wrights whose names make the period
for us moderns were “fashionable and in-
tellectual,” or that the entertainment they
provided can be so described, is utter
tosh. The intellectual and fashionable
section of London society was, in fact,
opposed very strongly to the new popu-
lar plays. The “University Wits” gener-
ally upheld the classical ideal and heaped
ridicule upon the rising school. Sack-
ville and Norton were two “intellectuals,”
and Gorbuduc,” classic in its construc-
tion, illustrates the type of play to which
they and others of their kidney would
have had the English stage conform.
Opposed to them were men of the stamp
of Greene and Marlowe and, later,
Shakspeare, who, aided by popular taste
which had been trained by four cen-
turies of Miracles,” succeeded in win-
ning a victory for the native product.
Mr. MacDougall is equally at sea when
he talks of the few theatres operating
in the London of Shakspeare’s day. James
Burbage built The Theatre in 1576.
Its success was immediate, and the next
30 years saw “a score of theatrical com-
panies, at least seven regular companies,
and a dozen or more inn-yards perma-
nently fitted for the giving of plays.”
Since, in the year 1600, London had a
population of only about 100,000, all this
activity would seem to indicate a strong
popular support of the theatre and at the
same time illustrate the degree of decay
to which it has come to-day. In Syd-
ney, a city with a population well over
the million mark, two legitimate theatres
keep going by sticking to musical
comedy! Healthy, isn’t it?
Lastly, “The mob never has supported
the best in any art.” Well, to desert the
theatre, now that other arts are drawn
into the discussion, how about literature?
Our first, and, in some opinions, our
finest, novelists were immensely popular
in their day. Richardson started it. Field-
ing and Smollett did not have to wait for
death to bring them fame and rewards
more substantial. Even the uncommon
Sterne was enjoyed by all classes. What
of Addison and Steele? Their essays
were read in every coffee-house in Lon-
don. The list, as far down as such popu-
lar successes as Thackeray and Dickens,
both, strangely enough, artists, could be
developed into a veritable avalanche.
No; if the theatre to-day were a
healthy, lusty organism it would get the
support that it received in the past, just
as other arts are continuing to get their
measure of public applause. But it is
dying of old age, and while one can sen-
timentalise over age trying to recapture
the exuberance of youth one cannot look
at it too long or too closely. “The mob”
has sensed that.

Current
Artbursts
Anthony Mor-
el ern s’ Gallery,
Sydney, houses a
co 11 e c tion of
prints of the
works of con-
temporary overseas artists (described as
“modern and impressionist”) that says
the last word not only about the modern-
ist art that is fit to print but about the
art of the printer. All the best-known
achievements of the French impression-
ist school of 40 years ago are included,
and in addition there are some impres-
sions by Englishmen and others of later
date, some of whom did not consider it
necessary to forget their drawing lessons
before they began to paint. Impression-
ism of the French school is at present
popular as a furnishing adjunct because
it is bright and cheerful, being principally
in reds, yellows and greens, and because,
even in a reproduction, it fills a house
with an odor of Culture as distinctive as
that of the polish with which a grand
piano is anointed. French impressionists
stand or fall on color. They riot in it,
and this critic is free to admit that they
produce, sometimes with the fresh joy-
ousness of a child with its first paint-box,
remarkable combinations. A first peep
at the Hordern main gallery (until lately
devoted to etchings) is like a glimpse of
a gay pagan paradise. “It’s pretty, but
is it art?” says Kipling’s devil to the
closer viewer. The answer is that any-
thing is art if you can get away with it,
and that if a generation likes its art to
be artless there isn’t much that can be
done about it. Anyway, there are in the
collection at least 144 gorgeous essays in
color unmarred by a false line, and for
those who like abandon (or absinthe)
in the line there are Monets, Matisses,
Pissarros and Gauguins galore.

Burlesque Humor Story Entry:—
THE SQUATTER'S
HAUTEUR
BY FREDRK
DENNIS
DRAWINGS by UNKWHITE
These words were noticed to have a marked effect... .He made
a horrible grinding noise with his teeth.
IN an armchair in the library in the
old homestead of Munwallamagud-
geribar—to give the place its better-
known and abbreviated title —sat the
Squatter. He was an old man, but he
still retained his aristocratic bearing and
quiet air of mastery. He still had eyes
of eagle-sharpness and ferocity, and he
still had his ears, nose and eyebrows, but
no hair.
Little did he dream of the dire tidings
he was soon to hear from his young
jackeroo, William Johnson (such is the
absurd name of our hero). Little did
he dream of the felonious intent of a
tall dark man approaching the home-
stead. Little did he dream of anything,
though the fact -that he wasn’t asleep
might account for this.
But, ah! Who is this that comes trip-
ping into the room? It is the Squatter’s
only child. Picking herself up, she seated
herself timidly on the edge of his chair.
(The reader is requested to imagine the
most divine creature he could possibly
imagine and then double it.)
“Father,” she said (that being the
manner in which she invariably addressed
her old man), “I feel that something is
amiss.”
Her father peered up at her from the
depths of his eyebrows.
“Nonsense, child,” he snorted. “What
makes you think aught is amiss?”
“I have a woman’s intuition,” said
the girl simply.
“Well, give it back to her ; you don’t
know how to use it,” said the Squatter.
“And, girl, there is yet another _ thing.
Never again let me see you sitting on
the sliprails with William Johnson, the
jackeroo.”
“But, father”
“Silence, girl!” thundered the Squatter.
“You have heard my wishes. Abide by
them.”
AFTER that there was nothing for the
poor girl to do but go outside and
gaze sorrowfully at the horizon. Fortu-
nately for her peace of mind, she didn’t
see the dark figure that slunk hurriedly
behind a saltbush. What she did see,
however, was the approaching cloud of
dust that was William Johnson.
“William,” she cried, “what is amiss?”
“Ah, Little One,” he said in tragic
tones, “something terrible has happened.
Something ghastly. But I must not tell
His eyes dilated.
you what it is. I might frighten you. It
is too frightful. I cannot tell you. You
might get alarmed. I must see your father.”
“Oh, William,” sobbed the poor girl,
“father is angry. He means to part us.”
“Rest assured. Little One,” said the
young man, approaching the front door,
“he has no more chance of parting us
than he has of parting his own hair. I
will speak to him.”
“Oh, no! Father is nqt himself to-
day,” cried the girl, wringing her hands.
“Who is he?” asked William, ringing
the bell. “Not,” he added manfully,
“that I care a yard of crutchings who
he is.”
At the sound of the bell the old house-
keeper came to the door.
She was stooped and shrunken, and
gazed queerly at William in the manner
that shrunken old housekeepers reserve
for those whom they know some terrible
secret about but would rather not say.
Who is this old crone? What does
she know? What terrible thing does
she keep hidden from William and
the reader?
(See final para-
graphs.)
C h u c kling
away to her-
self, she led
William to the
library and
hobbled off to
the murky re-
cesses of the
servants’ quar-
ters. William
entered.
“The worst
has happened,”
he gasped,
sinking into a
chair.
“Tell me
all” said the
Squatter, turn-
ing pale.
“The ruthless band of sheep-
stealers that has harassed Munwal-
lamagudgeribar for so long has pep-
petrated its most daring deed of law-
lessness. Every head of stock has
been stolen. The robbers have them
in a secret and inaccessible fastness
on the plains.”
The Squatter was heard to draw
a deep breath, but his proud spirit
quelled the words of alarm that sprang
to his lips.
“But that is not all,” said William.
“The river has risen and broken its
banks. In a few hours the homestead
will be inundated. Fierce tribes of abori-
ginals are rising in the north, and all the
run to the east is ablaze.”
“What else?” barked the Squatter.
“Well, that’s all I can do for you at
the moment,” said William. “But they
say”
He was interrupted by a look of horror
that suddenly overspread the Squatter’s
face. Standing on the doorstep was a
tall, black-garbed figure.
“You!” gasped the Squatter.
“Correct,” said the stranger.
SLOWLY the dark man moved his hand
to his hip pocket. His fingers
clutched their sinister object, and with
a diabolical leer that threatened to do
a permanent injury to his ears he drew
it forth with an ominous, deliberate
movement. William could not suppress
a shudder. Who will blame him? Let
him who has himself seen the fore-
closure of a mortgage cast the first stone.
The Squatter’s haughty spirit was broken.
He sank senseless to the floor.
At that moment (which, you will
admit, was accurate timing on our part)
the girl came running into the room.
“Father,” she cried, dropping beside
him, “speak to me, speak to *me! Oh ;
father, speak to me! Speak”
“Well, give me a chance,” said her

“Child, I have a confession to make. My
days are numbered. My hours are few.
In fact, my time is short. Boy, come
nigh. I have wronged you. I will now
tell all. Always my pride has kept my
lips sealed. It is time you both knew
that —that”
With a sudden spasmodic movement
the Squatter clutched at his breast and
his eyes dilated. He tried to speak. The
words would not come. He tried to rise.
He couldn’t.
“Oh, we must do something!” cried
the girl.
“Be not afraid, Little One,” said Wil-
liam. “Everything is for the best. You
attend to your father. Give him the best
of everything. Spare no expense. While
there is yet time I, William P. Johnson,
will save the homestead.”
With these noble words, the young
man took the Squatter’s revolver and

Stability
Institutions, like precepts, are not necessarily
sound because they are old, but rather they are
old because they are sound. It is only those
institutions which are firmly based on efficiency
and integrity which continue to live and grow
through long periods of time.
The development of the resources and services of
the National Bank during the past 76 years
indicates the stability of its foundation and the
soundness of its policies. During those years it
has grown from a small unit bank to a wide-
spread establishment with 429 offices and
branches in Australia and two offices in London,
while its oversea agents are to be found in all
important cities in other countries. The Bank
provides complete banking facilities for local and
foreign trade. Its officers are at all times ready
to answer inquiries and help customers to make
full use of its many services.

Pepsodent’s unique power to remove film

cleansing and polishing material has been
developed. This material is far safer than
any leading tooth powder—far softer than
polishing materials used in any other lead-

striking effectiveness.
This special film-removing material is
contained in Pepsodent exclusively—and in
no other dentifrice whatsoever. That’s why
Pepsodent gives results not possible with,

T’HE shades of
* night were
falling on all and sundry when once more
William drew rein at the old homestead.
His clothes were in a sorry state, and he
was bespattered with dust and grime and
other people’s blood.
Our heroine, good, reliable girl, was
waiting at the sliprails.
“The homestead is safe! ” said Wil-
liam. “Alone I tracked the thieves to
their lair. Unaided I set about them.
Without the least assistance I disarmed
them and made them build a levee across
the bottom of the horse paddock. This
prevented the swollen waters of the river
from reaching the homestead, directing
them, instead, to the north, where they
were responsible for putting out the bush-
fire and preventing the blacks from com-
ing down upon us. With my bare hands
I —but, tell me. Little One, is your father
alive yet?”
“Alas, not yet!” sobbed the girl.
“P-poor father; his spirit was broken.
Towards three o’clock he was smitten
with acute pains in the vestibule, and
never smiled again.”
Into the midst of this poignant scene
came the dark man, who said “Ha!”
“Ah, good sir,” cried the girl, “we
cannot pay you.”
Whereat the dark one stroked his
moustache and cleared his throat, but
the scullery-maid was on hand to save a
nasty situation. She came screaming out
of the house.
“Quick,” she cried, “the old ’ouse-
keeper has been taken over queer sud-
den. She’s dyin’. She’s got a secret.”
“At last,” said our heroine, “we shall
learn the truth. We must go to her.”
They went.
The dark man went along, too, feel-
ing discomforted at the mess he had
made of his own big scene.
The old housekeeper was lying on her
bed gently breathing her last. As they
entered she pointed a gnarled finger at
William and began to speak.
“Soon,” she croaked, “I will be gone.
Yet there remains time for me to right
the wrong. Ah, soon —soon I will be
gone. You must learn the secret of your
birth.”
“What!” exclaimed William, starting
back aghast. “Is there a secret?”
“Two,” croaked the old woman.
“Two secrets?”
“Two about you, two about the young
lady, one about”
“Woe is me!” cried William, clasping
his forehead. “Alackaday! Tell me—tell
me about two or three of these secrets.”
“ Tis a long, long story,” murmured
the old woman. “I must first take you
back to the time when I was a little girl
playing on the seashore in England. How
well I remember”
“But the secrets!” cried William.
“Soon —-soon you will be gone. The
secrets!”
“You,” said the old woman. “You
are the rightful owner of this property.”
(Consternation.)
“How can you know this?” cried
William.
“The Squatter was your father. I am
your stepmother. You are the child of
his first marriage. Your father naturally
wanted a daughter, and when you were
born he was angry and mortified, and

peace. Let not the moon come up upon the
mortgage. Beneath the floor of this room
you will find my jewels left to me by my
second husband, the Marquis of Roxton-
haugh. I think he was the second.”
These words were noticed to have a
marked effect upon the dark man. He
made a horrible grinding noise with his
teeth, the ends of his moustache went
suddenly limp, and slamming the door
behind him he vanished into the ambient
night.
By this time the old woman’s eyes had
closed, and her whispering had become
faint indeed, but the brave old soul still
struggled on.
“The boundary-rider at Seven Mile
Creek,” she whispered, “is the rightful
heir to the throne of Roumania. Cook
is the daughter of gipsies. She was stolen
from them by the Squatter when a child.
The gardener has a mulberry mark in
the small of the back.”
The last words Were hardly audible.
The noble old soul was all but gone. But
she still had more to tell. They bent low
to catch her final words.
“Th —the scullery-maid,” she breathed.
“I could never discover anything about
the scullery-maid.”
With these words on her lips the daunt-
less old soul passed away. The Giant
Reaper claimed her for his own. She
was gone to a happier clime.
THE years have rolled by. The strife is
done. The storm clouds have passed
over. The river has gone down. The
price of wool has gone up. The bush-
fire has been put out. The sheep-stealers
have been put in. The mortgage is no
more. The scullery-maid has a fifth
share in a lottery ticket. Ireland has
Home Rule. The Disarmament Confer-
ence is two adjournments ahead of
schedule. And at the old homestead of
Munwallamagudgeribar joy and William
Johnson reign supreme.
Our heroine has long since proved her
claim to the title by marrying William.
Having gone seriously into the matter
of their united pedigrees and worked it
out by a system of graphs and logarithms
they could find no reason why they
shouldn’t call for tenders among the
local clergymen, and they have lived
happily together up to the time of going
to press. The Goanna Salve Film Com- |
pany has purchased the sole rights of
William’s gallant fight with the sheep-
duffers, and the scene of the memorable
conflict has attracted a record number
of tourists during the current fiscal year. ;
The fierce tribes to the north have been
subdued and civilised, and do a lively |
trade selling bottled mirage water to
the tourists.
So let us sing long live the king, and
William, long live he ; and if the manner
in which he turned his adversities to
account and won his way to fame and
fortune should help to influence the
youth of the nation to go on the land,
his efforts, and ours, shall not have been
in vain.

Pared in deep skies ... I but a little maid.
But now mine hours are sounded out like
chimes —
Never again shall bed of mine be warm.
The seconds darken round me, like a swarm
Of bees that steal my honey quite away.
I am glad some flowers have nodded in my
day.
MAORILAND.
Nay, Queen and playfellow, I ask your pardon.
I am a little slow in following you
Into the moonlit mazes, the wise blue
Cypresses stoopt like sorcerers round this
garden.
I had a mother once, but I grew tall,
Wayward and brown. Methinks, too, there
was one
Whose kisses ripened in the noonday sun
Your servant’s lips. But, there, what matters all?
Our little time of play and dreaming done,
Into the spangled grass let the fruit fall . . .
I am tired . . . Our resting is not far to seek.
I feel your slim hand cooler on my cheek.

THE DEAMON
SANCER
FLAT
BY BERNARD CRONIN.
THE extreme isolation of the township
of Saucer Flat —which may be
topographically defined as a clay-
pan entirely surrounded by sand and
flies—probably accounts for the odd fact
that so far no whisper has reached the
metropolitan press concerning the re-,
markable experience which recently be-
fell the inhabitants.
True, the Rev. James Triangle, sole
professional upholder of spiritual values
in the locality, began a cautious letter
intended for his bishop in Sydney ; but
the intervening death of old Mrs. Mori-
arty, as the not wholly unexpected climax
to a life of sin, so distracted the good
man’s thoughts that he was unable to
get beyond “thirdly,” and finally gave up
the attempt altogether.
Constable Whoosh certainly included
some mention of the affair in his weekly
report to the sergeant at Emuville, but
with such a confusion of incident as to
cause the sergeant to remark wrathfully
to his wife that Whoosh must have taken
to the booze again, and the sooner he
was transferred the better. As for Dr.
Parbottle, it would seem he knew no-
thing at first hand, being at the time well
down with one of his bilious attacks, in
company with Jake Burr, landlord of
the Saucer Flat Arms.
The previous night had been chiefly
remarkable for the violent thunderstorm
which broke over the township towards
early morning. The air was charged with
electricity and mosquitoes ; not unnatur-
ally very few of the worthy citizens
achieved a satisfactory night’s rest, the
exceptions being Dr. Parbottle and the
landlord, who slept soundly in the hay-
loft over the hotel stables, following a
brief argument with Mrs. Burr as to the
propriety of appearing in public with
no covering except two bottles and a
corkscrew.
WHEN Saucer Flat crawled from its
bed into the muggy sunshine it was
with a feeling that something unusual
had happened, or was about to happen.
There was a strange smell of burning in
the air, and the goat belonging to Angus
McHinery, who farmed ten acres on
the banks of where geologists agreed had
been a river in Cretaceous times, was
found dead half in and half out of the
Rev. Triangle’s dustbin.
Constable Whoosh held an inquiry
into the facts of the bereavement, on the
passionate application of Angus Mc-
Hinery, but was forced to the official
ruling: “Death from cause or causes
unknown.” He also instructed the goat’s
owner to remove the corpse from the
jurisdiction of the Court, an act per-
formed in grim Caledonian silence.
The atmosphere being slightly re-
stored, Constable Whoosh went on duty
in the cane chair on his back verandah
with a handkerchief over his face to dis-
guise the Law from possible evildoing
strangers, and the Rev. Triangle returned
to his study to wrestle with his sermon
for Sunday. For long he had been
pained by the profanity in everyday use
by the citizens of Saucer Flat, and
it was his purpose to preach a rousing
appeal for verbal sobriety. The thing
was becoming a positive scandal. The
good man was convinced that, unless im-
provement was quickly effected, Saucer
Flat had every prospect of meeting the
same fate as meted to the late Sodom
and Gomorrah. .
Meanwhile life went on in Saucer Flat.
And the strange smell of burning per-
sisted. It seemed now to have a slight
tang of sulphur in it.
IT was close to midday when the first
intimation of there being something
wrong in the cosmogony of Saucer Flat
made itself known.
Bill Coffin, proprietor of the one-man
sawmill at the rear of the police station,
made a swipe at a darting blowfly, missed
and nicked his hand on the teeth of the
bench-saw. The momentary pain was so
severe that he was startled into unusually
mild expletive:
“Strike me fat!” ,
On the instant, it seemed to him, he
knew a feeling of suffocation. He was
on the point of choking when there came
a ripping, tearing sound, accompanied
by a popping of metal buttons. Throng
the widening gaps of his clothing B
Coffin saw his flesh pushing itself out
like a monstrous mushroom. He ten
himself swelling to bursting-point. His
fingers were the size of German sausages,
and already his cheeks had assumed the
proportions of balloons. Before his fat-
squeezed eyes stretched an enormous
bulk—he recognised it presently as his
stomach.
The sight was too much. With a
roar of terror that brought Constable
Whoosh out of his cane chair at the run,
the unfortunate petitioner for greater
avoirdupois fell on his own sawdust heap
like a stricken ox.
It was so the amazed Constable
Whoosh found him a minute or two
later. Bill Coffin floundered helplessly
on his back, shreds of singlet dotted here
and there about his monstrous person,
like islands in an archipelago of flesh.
Hearing the approach of his wife, Con-
stable Whoosh, recovering from his
stupefaction, hastily covered the in-
decency with a tarpaulin. Shouting to
Mrs. Whoosh to keep the children away
and get hold of Dr, Parbottle, he drew
his notebook from his pocket and began
a stern interrogatory.
“Now, then, what’s the meaning of
this? What’s your name? It’s my duty
to inform you that everything you say
will be took down and”—
“Shut up, you idiot! ” Bill Coffin
admonished in a shaky crescendo. With
an inkling of the truth he was too terri-
fied to swear. “Can’t you see it’s me —
Bill Coffin? Stop gaping and gimme a
hand up.”
Constable Whoosh, scarcely believing
his ears, achieved recognition.
“What’s ’appened to you?” he stam-
mered.
“Things,” Bill Coffin said darkly. “I’ve
been took at me word . . . Cripes, I must
be ’arf a ton!”
The arrival of the Rev. James Triangle,
pale with apprehension, cut short his
mumblings. The reverend gentleman
listened to the facts in perturbed silence,
except for an occasional “Tut-tut.”
“But, my good Coffin, this is—ah—in-
credible.” He advanced, at the invita-
tion of Constable Whoosh, to peer
timidly under the edge of the tarpaulin,
recoiling in horror. “Are you sure you
have not been bitten by some —ah —
insect?”
Constable Whoosh said astutely: “A
inseck what could do all that to a man,
Mr. Triangle, would be some inseck. I
can’t make head nor tail of him.”
“It must be a sort of —ah —visitation,”
the Rev. Triangle said with a shudder.
“You don’t feel ill, Coffin, eh?”
The victim thought not.
“A bit ’ard in me breathing, reverend,
but otherwise ’earty, now it’s all over,
as you might say. What I can’t get at
is ’oo done the dirty. Nine-stone-five
I was. And now ’ark at me.”
“God’s ways are not our ways,” the
Rev. Triangle murmured, mercifully un-
aware of his apt play upon words. “I’m
afraid this will be a sad blow to your
poor wife. Extraordinary! I’ve never
heard anything like it before. Have you
sent for —ah —assistance, Mr. Whoosh?
Dear me! This is most distressing” .. .
Bill coffin was taken to his home
on a sledge drawn by two bullocks,
the after-guard of the tarpaulin trailing';
behind in the dust.
Attempts to rouse Dr. Parbottle to a
sense of his duty having failed, Constable
Whoosh, after laboriously taking down
the depositions of the swollen Coffin,
returned thoughtfully to the police
station. The Rev. Triangle accompanied,
him. They arrived to find a small crowd
of citizens being presided over unwill-
ingly in the front garden by the con-,
stable’s wife. That estimable lady
greeted them with relief.
“What’s wrong now?” Constable,
Whoosh demanded.
“I’m sure I don’t know, Mrs. Whoosli
said perspiringly. “I never knew sic
goings on. They’re saying ere that Old
Bender ’as suddenly turned all pmk-HKe.
And Curphy’s grey mare, what he drives
in the butcher’s cart, has disappeared. ;
Constable Whoosh scowled round at
the ring of scared faces.
“Stolen, eh! It ’ad to ’appen Jo-day,
didn’t it! Couldn’t leave that till to
morrer. Run me oft me feet before

A Revelation
in Relief of
STOMACH
ILLS
The amazing promptness with which
‘Bisurated’ Magnesia arrests acute pain,
and its downright remedial effects in
obstinate cases of Indigestion, Gastritis
and Ulcerated Stomach will be a revela-
tion to the despairing sufferer who puts
‘Bisurated’ Magnesia to the test.
“MARVELLOUS FOR
STOMACH TROUBLES”
says Mr. Dyson of Birming-
ham, who writes: “ I have I
suffered with my stomach !
for the last five years without
relief. It was like being in
hell. I saw your advertise-
ment and sent for a bottle of
‘Bisurated’ Magnesia. It
seemed to drown the pain.
It is marvellous for stomach
troubles. I am a dead man
come back to life as the
hardest work does not hurt
menow,thanksto‘Bisurated' j
Magnesia.”

-NO PAINS NOW!
Mrs. Jones of Worcester
writes“ I have been ill for
seven years with gastritis
which turned to ulcers—the
pain almost drove me mad.
I was not able to take food
of any kind. A month ago,
whilst in dreadful pain a.
friend told me to try
‘ Bisurated ’ Magnesia which
I did, and I have had no pains
since—the first month with-
out pain for seven years.
Can now eat any kind of
food with comfort.”
'Bisurated’ Magnesia completed her
recovery when other methods failed.
Why continue to suffer pain and misery
when you can so easily be rid of them?
When you take ‘Bisurated * Magnesia you
are not making an experiment; you are
taking a remedy which has been banishing
stomach ills for over 20 years. Get a
bottle of ‘Bisurated’ Magnesia, powder or
tablets, from any chemist and start your

they’ve finished. You tell Curphy to
offer a reward, and I’ll see what can
be done.”
Curphy himself pushed his way for-
ward. He said agitatedly; “She weren’t
stolen. I was driving, I was, and sudden-
like the shafts went down on the road,
and I come a fair purler. Mighter
broken me neck. And when I got up
there weren’t a sign of old Molly. Only
the ’arness ’anging” . . .
Constable Whoosh stared and scratched
his head.
The Rev. Triangle interposed; “Did
you, by any chance, my friend, use —ah
your usual picturesque vocabulary
addressed to the—ah—animal?”
“Begging your pardon, Mr. Triangle,”
Curphy said, a little shamefacedly, “I
was a bit ’eated at the time. She shied
coming round the parsonage corner, and
I says: ‘Go to blithering blazes! ’ I says
. . . not meaning Billy ’Ughes any
’arm”. . .
‘And she went!” the Rev. Triangle
said in a trembling whisper. He wrung
his hands and made noises at the back
of his throat. “Dearie me! Oh, dearie
me! ... If you will excuse me I think
1 will go home. I am not—ah—at all
well. In the meantime, I implore you,
my dear friends, to abstain from impious
petition. There is something . . . impos-
sible to explain . . . for every idle word
a man shall speak . . . Oh, excuse me !”
Ignoring their blank looks he tottered
to his home. He was overcome with
horror and remorse. Ah! If he had
preached his sermon earlier! For he
saw plainly that a demon was here —
emanation, possibly, from the terrific up-
heaval of elements on the previous night
The Rev. Triangle groaned audibly as
he sank into a chair. He thought of
Ahriman and Lilith, Asmodeus and
Mephisto ; the Disquisitions Magic® ; the
Fustis Daemonum . . . and his heart failed
him. Satan let loose. And if such evil
beneath the very eye of day, what when
night should come again?
THAT saintly widow Mrs. Jeraboam
1 Spendthrift, housekeeper at the
Vicarage, heard her master’s moans, and
hastened in with the aspros. She had always
had a hankering to be a parson’s wife.
“You poor dear man! The hot
weather always did play up with your
liver, didn’t it?”
The Rev. Triangle waved her aside
feverishly.
“Not an aspro?” Mrs. Spendthrift con-
ceded winningly. “What then?”
Prayer!” the Rev. Triangle muttered.
“Supplication . . . Who is that?”
It was Constable Whoosh. His honest
face revealed the dawn of a great fear.
The Rev. Triangle pulled himself to-
gether. These poor souls were relying
on him. He must not let them down.
“Go,” he said to Mrs. Spendthrift. “We
would be alone.”
The housekeeper, concealing her chag-
rin, obeyed.
“Well, Whoosh? I see you know.
Tell me the worst! ”
There came dreadful confirmation of
his fears. From all quarters of Saucer
Flat news of outrageous happenings was
pouring in. Three men and one woman
had turned purple; the town dustman
had become so bandy that he could only
sit with comfort on one of his own
barrels ; and Frazer’s bullock-driver had
gone suddenly blind.
“And that ain’t all,” Constable Whoosh
said in a congealed whisper. “You
know young Dick Horrocks? Without
a word of a lie, Mr. Triangle, he’s bin
turned into a cow”. . ,
“Whoosh! Think what you’re saying! ”
“A crimson cow, Mr. Triangle. My
old woman give one look at ’im and
fainted. She was talking to young Dick
over the fence, and —well, he don’t
mean no ’arm by it, it’s just his way,
as we all know —he says, Mr. Triangle,'
he says: ‘lf wot they’re saying about
Bill Coffin is true, then I’m a somethinged
cow!’ And sure enough ’e is. Just like
that it happened.”
The Rev. Triangle was speechless.
“Wot’s ’appening to Saucer Flat?”
Constable Whoosh demanded tremu-
lously. “This ain’t in reason. There’s
apthing in the regulations”
“An evil spirit has come to mock
man’s blasphemies by granting impious
requests,” the Rev. Triangle said, re-
covering himself with energy. “Can’t
ybu smell the sulphur. Whoosh? Though,
as a matter of fact, it seems to have
worn off quite a bit in the last half-hour.”
Constable Whoosh stared.
“An evil spirit! Well, I’m da”
“Don’t say it!” the Rev. Triangle
screamed. In the nick of time his hand
choked the word on the policeman’s lips.
“Man, think of your wife and innocent
children!”
Constable Whoosh, trembling vio-
lently, mumbled: “You saved my life!”
“Your soul!” the Rev. Triangle cor-
rected sternly.
SUDDENLY he smote his brow. “Ah,
fool that I am! Don’t you see,
Whoosh? They must reverse!”
“Reverse?”
The Rev. Triangle was on his feet.
His mild eyes flashed behind their spec-
tacles.
“Toll the firebell. Whoosh. Gather
the afflicted together while there is yet
time. Hurry, man , . . hurry!”
Only half comprehending, Constable
Whoosh stumbled to his task. As the
Rev. Triangle hastened after him there
appeared a small urchin on a wobbling
bicycle. The thing overbalanced and fell,
and a childish oath assoiled the murky
air:
“Blast the thing!”
Instinctively the Rev. Triangle threw ,
up one thin, ascetic hand to cover his 1
eyes. His shrinking ears heard only a {
faint tinkling, followed by a rude ex- |
clamation. He opened one eye, then the
other. The small boy was staring with
consternation at a machine which seemed
to be slowly coming in pieces. One part
after another fell apart.
For a second he failed to grasp this
new miracle. Then, in a flash, he under-
stood. The evil influence was waning.
If they did not take care
At that, Saucer Creek, already agog,
was treated to the spectacle of the Rev. j
James Triangle tearing for the little
church belfry, coat-tails flying, shouting
wildly: “Hasten! ... For God’s sake, j
hasten! ”
OARD on the tolling of the bell at the j
“ hands of the perspiring Constable
Whoosh, came the citizens of the afflicted
township; among them the obese Bill
Coffin, decorously draped in a counter-
pane. Word that the parson was about
to attempt an exorcism had already
spread, and willing whips presently drove
into the assembly, at a shambling canter,
an extraordinary-looking cow of a pillar-
box red which was understood to con-
tain the terrified personality of young
Dick Horrocks.
“Reverse! ” the Rev. Triangle exhorted
urgently. He sniffed the air as he
shouted, and was appalled to discover
only a lingering trace of its former sul- I
phurousness. “Hurry! Hurry! . . . Bill
Coffin! ”
The fatetudinarian gave a bewildered
leer.
“ ’Ere, reverence?” (
“Reverse!” screamed the Rev. Tri-
angle. “Say it, you fool! Say: ‘Strike
me thin! ’ ”
“Strike me thin!” Bill Coffin quavered.
Slowly, very slowly, he began to
dwindle. Seeing the phenomenon under
their very noses, the wits of his fellow-
sufferers caught on desperately. The air
was rent with petition.
“Strike me white!”
“Strike me legs straight!”
“Strike me eyes oil right agin!”
To this uproar was added the bellow-
ing of the pillar-box cow, unable to
attain the human speech. The Rev. Tri-
angle, with a flash of Christian sacrifice,
made oath on its behalf.
“Speaking for Richard Horrocks,” he
cried stirringly. “Strike me human! ”
And bowed his head in a burning
shame.
That good woman Mrs. Spendthrift,
rubber-necking on the edge of the crowd,
witnessed to her lasting amazement the
slow but steady disintegration of six hun-
dredweight of scarlet cow into a residue
bearing the unmistakably plain linea-
ments of young Horrocks. She saw,
too, the Rev. Triangle—his great work
completed—sink on his knees in the road-
way in an attitude of fervent thanks-
giving.
Close by stood Angus McHinery, wear-
ing a dour grin of satisfaction. What-
ever happened Angus had got something
out of it. With masterly foresight he
had, an hour previously, hastened to his
oat crop and there delivered himself of
the following blasphemy;
“Starve the crows!”
He was thinking now of the carrion
corpses littering his cultivation as the
result of that canny request.
Into these communings broke the
hoarse voice of Curphy the butcher.
“Gripes!” it said; “wot about the old
mare? Well, ’ere goes . . . Come on
out of it, Molly, you blanky old-timer!”
Followed only a long silence, save for
the praying of the Rev. James Triangle.
From the shelter of his counterpane the
restored Bill Coffin interjected com-
miseratingly:
“It’s too late, Sam. The juice is orf! "
At that moment something fell from
the sky. It smote that unassuming
woman Mrs. Spendthrift sluggishly
upon the head, so that she bit the dust.
“Well, I’m —yes, I am—l’m damned! ”
said Constable Whoosh.
He reached out a gingerly hand and
picked up the charred stump of a horse’s
tail.

My Political
Life
By W.A. HOLMAN
McGOWEN BEGINS
TO FAIL
A definite
change now be-
gan to manifest
itself in our
leader. On various occasions since his
return it had been apparent that he was
not quite the McGowen of former days.
Outwardly he was as robust as ever, an
iron frame covering an indomitable spirit.
It was apparent, nevertheless, that the
stores of energy were diminishing.
He was less disposed to grapple with
the laborious details of a Premier’s life
than he had been. He let the control of
several important matters, one item after
another, drop from his hands.
Lethargy on the part of the chief leads
necessarily to ineffectiveness in Cabinet.
The Cabinets of the latter part of 1911
remain in my memory as melancholy
illustrations of what such gatherings
should not be.
Our leader, a man of simple directness,
had gone away at a moment when there
was no task before his Ministry except
that of preparing a programme, present-
ing it to Parliament and bullocking it
through. For such a task few men
were better equipped than he. Sledge-
hammer tactics and bulldog tenacity of
purpose were well within his repertoire,
and if it had been a mere matter of hard
pounding I think he could have pounded
harder and longer than most people.
On his return, however, he had found
the situation entirely changed. Difficul-
ties surrounded us on every side. That
our life should hang by a single thread
was a proposition which he was quite pre-
pared to accept; but that there should
be half a dozen razor edges just pressing
against that thread, and that he should
have to refrain from innumerable move-
ments for fear of sending one of them
through it, was a situation which irked
him bitterly.
He chafed under the necessity of sup-
porting Willis when Willis was wrong
—as he often thought him. He did not
like having to make friends with the
Upper House when it was wrong —
as it was occasionally. Above all,
he resented the thought of having to con-
sider the feelings of outside supporters
who it was essential should not be
alienated, in view of the possibility of an
early appeal to the country.
McGowen was never a man to dance
among eggshells, and the task that con-
fronted him was out of keeping with his
temperament and his training. The relax-
ing of his strong grasp upon the party’s
affairs was bad enough ; but, worse than
that, while he left them to me, he did
not always trouble to sustain me in the
dispositions I had made.
The restoration of our original major-
ity, which now counted as three instead
of one, seeing that we had an Opposition-
ist in the chair, removed one part of
these special annoyances ; but only one.
There was an atmosphere of bitterness
and disorder in the House which shocked
McGowen’s sense of decorum, tempered
by periodical displays of authority from
Willis in his sterner moods which out-
raged McGowen’s instincts of freedom.
He felt only a limited and thwarted satis-
faction in his work from this time on.
DEATH OF
MACDONELL
During Octo-
ber Macdonell
died. This, our
first death, was a
specially bitter blow to the leader, and
materially helped to intensify the gloom
which was beginning to envelop him
and all of us. Macdonell had an individu-
ality which was irreplaceable in our little
band, and neither we nor the .Shearers’
Union were ever likely to look upon his
like again.
Cabinet now determined that Nielsen
should represent the Government at an
Irrigation Conference to be held in . the
Western States of America. Nielsen, who
chafed under the enforced quietude of
his retirement, was still anxious to con-
tribute in some way to our success.
The compliment of his selection was
thoroughly deserved, and the benefit it
was likely to do the State was obvious.
CITY
DEVELOPMENT
SCHEMES
Sir John Hay
had by now made
his visit, in-
spected Sydney
and left his re-
port. On the as-
tonishing figures he had seen as to the
growth of the city and its population, he
had no hesitation in determining that
nothing could meet the situation but an
electrified city railway. He sketched out
in broad outline the essentials of such
a scheme, combined with the North
Shore bridge and embracing the nearer
harbor suburbs. His expert opinion
decided us.
Dacey next brought forward certain
housing proposals which were destined to
have a permanent standing in the labor
schemes of that generation. It is perhaps
a little difficult to see what housing had
to do with the work of the Colonial
Treasurer. The Savings Bank Commis-
sioners were under him, however, and
it was part of their business to make
advances to people anxious to build.
This brought the whole matter more or
less under his purview. He proposed
three separate lines of action.
First, the Government should itself
build a model suburb upon Crown
lands, remaining landlord and letting the
houses at a rental sufficient to pay a fair
return upon the value of the land and
building.
Secondly, there was to be a Building
Department, which would put up a house
according to approved plans in any part
of the city for any person satisfying cer-
tain conditions, payment being made by
instalments extending over a term of
years. This part of the scheme was in-
tended primarily to meet the require-
ments of wage-earners whose needs
caused them to live in other parts of the
city than those served by the model
suburbs which he intended should eventu-
ally be built over the whole circumfer-
ence of the city.
Finally, it was hoped that the work of
the Government Savings Bank Commis-
sioners in making advances for house-
building upon favorable terms would go
on on a larger scale.
The second scheme, it should be said
at once, was afterwards handed to the
Savings Bank Commissioners to be run
as a sub-branch of their general work,
and ultimately was virtually abandoned
as an unnecessary invasion of a sphere
sufficiently served by private enterprise ;
but the model suburb itself was pushed
forward energetically, and became a re-
markable success.
It is a matter of great regret that no
other such groups have been established
elsewhere in accordance with Dacey’s
plans. ' '
INCOME-TAX
LEGISLATION
A distressing
incident which
markedly in-
creased the pre-
vailing atmosphere of unrest within the
party now occurred in connection with
the passage of the Income Tax Bill
through the Upper House.
It met much opposition. Flowers,
our skilful representative in that Cham-
ber, realised early that the bill would
not go through without amendment.
He accordingly obtained from Ash-
ton and other leading opponents a
statement of the minimum change on
which they would consent to its passage.
Their desired amendments, as in duty
bound, he submitted to the Premier,
who, in a mood of quite unusual
nonchalance, agreed to the whole of
them, and authorised Flowers to say
so, without in any way realising the
necessity for consulting Dacey.
In the meantime Dacey had obtained
in advance a copy of the “Hansard”
report of the Council’s debate, and, upon
the information thus obtained, had him-
self worked out a series of compromises
which he was ready to accept upon
entirely different lines from those sug-
gested by Ashton. Dacey communicated
his plans to the press as a step towards
creating an atmosphere of conciliation,
but Flowers had also communicated to
the press his plans—endorsed by the
leader. Dacey next day had the in-
tensely irritating experience of reading
that his own views on the disputed points
had been entirely overridden.
Flowers’s communication was pub-
lished either alongside his own or before
his had been published. (One of these
contretemps actually occurred; my
memory, is at fault as to which.) In
either case Dacey felt it in the extreme.
By degrees better feelings prevailed.
[Another chapter from Holman’s Life will
be given m next week’s Bulletin.]
Holman and Henry Willis
Dear Bulletin,— l do not think the
accusation of “perfidy” made by Mr.
Willis against my late husband (B.
23/1/’35) should be allowed to pass’
Such a word was never applied to any
action of his in his lifetime, and now
that he can no longer defend himself the
charge should be emphatically and in-
dignantly denied.
As regards the circumstances that led
to Mr. Willis becoming Speaker, I fol-
lowed every step of that critical time
with intensest interest., I well remember
my husband coming home and telling me
of the interview with Mr. Willis. . He
described the incident just as it is given
in the memoirs.—Yours faithfully, Ada
A. Holman.


Pelmanism
Scientific training of Mind ,
Memory and Personality
. . . “and another charm of Pelmanism
is that it transforms every Pelmanist
into his own Sherlock Holmes 5 ’ .....
E. V. Lucas, Essayist and Assistant Editor of London “Punch”
CHERLOCK HOLMES, the most
acute mind in fiction!
His extraordinary confidence,
his poise, his calm, his amazing
ability to penetrate to the essential
heart of a problem rested on “that
blend of close observation and
deduction” which Mr. Lucas is at
pains to point out is an integral
part of the Pelman System.
The analogy between Holmes
and Pelmanism goes further for
Pelmanism concerns itself, not only
with the material for thought which
observation supplies and with the
exercise of the reasoning faculties
inherent to deduction but also with
quick decision and appropriate
action. Thought is rarely effective
in itself; its logical outcome is
action. Something has to be done,
and Sherlock Holmes in fiction and
the Pelmanist in real life are alike
in possessing the final qualification
of success: after observing and
deducing, they act.
ELMANISM is a transforming
influence. It transforms by
developing personal qualities and
attributes that make the individual
stand out in any community and
in any circumstances. Amongst
these attributes and qualities the
most important are:
Observation Self-Confidence
Concentration Will-Power
Judgment Initiative
Decision Promptness
And a Reliable Memory.
THESE qualities are the base on
which steadiness, serenity,
stability and energy rest. Pelman-
ism strengthens them by scientific
methods based on natural laws
until they become habitual and are
exercised in all the affairs of life,
in ordinary everyday matters as
well as in crises and on big occa-
sions.
It is proper to admit frankly
that Pelmanists do not wish to
be transformed into Sherlock
Holmeses. They want to be them-
selves, but themselves at their best,
with all their powers developed,
with their physical and mental
competency at its highest pitch so
that they can in their chosen walks
of life, or in new walks if necessary,
acquit . themselves honourably,
courageously and successfully.
They seek command of themselves,
they strive for that happiest of all
possessions, a habit of life, thought
and work that earns the respect of
their associates, makes them effec-
tive in their regular employments
and lifts them to the top of any
special occasion that may arise—
but only as themselves, for the
Pelmanist is an individual with his
own name, his own peculiar powers,
his own lawful occasions and his
own personality.

aridmore than 650,000 people have gone through the Pelman Course. Below are
opinions received recently from some of the 31,000 who have enrolled with the Pelman
Institute in Melbourne. We could fill a whole “Bulletin” with such letters.
PRINTER (29/6/34)—1 have at(:aimed a
standard of efficiency which has enabled me
to secure an executive position. The obscure
and complex are now clear and simple,
CLERK (14/10/34)—1 have just received
my Diploma in Economics, at the Sydney
University and I am grateful to the Insti-
tute for showing me how to use my mind...
Pelmanism is an enemy of fear and ignor-
ance. it is packed with commonsense and
practical advice and with inspiration to
bigger living.
PLANTATION MANAGER (17/8/34)—•
1 am the youngest plantation manager m
the Solomons. I undoubtedly owe my -success
to Pelmanism.
CHEMIST’S APPRENTICE (37/8/34)
I wish to express my gratitude to; Pel-
tttanism. I feel entirely remade. My obser-
ration, concentration, personality and, above
all, my memory bare improved.
ENGINEERING DRAFTSMAN (8/6/’34)—
Tlie exercises set certainly made me think
for myself.
SHBEPFARMER (14/6/’34) I have kept
an account of the time spent on the Course.
It amounted to a shade under three months
and the average time per day—4o minutes.
COMMERCIAL . TRAVELLER (15/4/'SI)
There are twenty-four Lessons, because on
each Work Sheet returned 1 have found as
much information and instruction as was
contained in the Lesson itself.
Assistant grocer (23/3/’34)—i would
strongly advise anyone who is feeling
depressed, or who is weak-willed or who may
be naturally shy in company to join up
with the Institute.
BANK CLERK (5/5/'32) —I now hare
ideals, thoughts and an outlook which enable
me to increase my efforts towards the goal
of honest, honourable and successful
endeavour.
ENGINEDRIVER (2S/2/’S4)— It is with a
wonderful sense of ability and security that
I face the future.
ARTICLED CLERK (14/10/32) —I have
enjoyed and appreciated the Pelinan Course
as I have rarely enjoyed anything before.
BANK CLERK (6/3/33)—1 was a bit
sceptical of all the claims you made for it
but 1 know now that they were not exag-
gerated one iota.
CONTRACTOR (23/l/’34)— Another dark
corner of the mind has been garnished and
made orderly.

UpELMANISM makes all
* past experience, whatever
its nature may have been, of
service in the present; it is at
one and the same time the spirit
of success and the means to

It is the plain truth that, no

woman may be placed—in a
big organisation, working with
many others ; in a profession ;
in a small business as proprietor,
manager, clerk or salesman ; on
the land ; in factory or work-

Pelmanism will help him to
make the most of his circum-

himself.
